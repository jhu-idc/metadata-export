The Port of Baltimore ranks in the top<br />
five ports in this country. Exporting over 12<br />
million tons of coal in 1981 it is second<br />
only to Newport News on the East Coast.<br />
The port is a major exporter of grain and<br />
importer of ore. Several times during the<br />
past decade the Port of Baltimore has led<br />
all other East Coast ports in the shipment of<br />
autos and is the 2nd largest handler of con-<br />
tainer shipping, on the East Coast. In 1982<br />
the total foreign commerce moving through<br />
the port was 32.6 million tons and was<br />
valued at over 15 billion dollars.<br /><br />
While the Port of Baltimore continues<br />
to grow in a number of key areas, other<br />
ports are also making improvements to<br />
their facilities. Many East Coast and Gulf<br />
ports have committed large sums of public<br />
and private dollars for renovation and<br />
expansion of their marine terminals and<br />
transportation systems. If the port of Balti-<br />
more is to maintain its competitive position<br />

Policy:<br /><br />
The Maryland Port Administration,<br />
working with other state agencies,<br />
federal and local governments<br />
should develop a comprehensive<br />
plan for the disposal and<br />
management of dredge materials<br />
generated from both public and<br />
private sector projects in Maryland<br />
waters over the next 20 years.<br /><br />
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers<br />
recommended in June, 1969, that channels<br />
in the harbor be deepened to 50 feet to<br />
accommodate the ever-larger bulk carriers<br />
which transport such sizable volumes of<br />
commodities to and from the Port. Cur-<br />
rently most bulk goods, coal, iron ore, grain<br />
and petroleum products are moved in<br />
40,000 to 60,000 dead weight ton ships.<br />
Often these ships and even larger cargo<br />
carriers cannot be filled to capacity because<br />
of the 42-foot channel. This requires the<br />
ships to make an additional stop at another<br />
port to be loaded to full capacity or “top-<br />
off”’. The proposed 50"" channel will allow<br />
larger ships to call on the port and existing<br />
ships to be loaded to capacity. This will<br />
lower the cost of shipping bulk goods. It is<br />
estimated that the 50"" channel will produce<br />
an average annual savings of over $150 mil-<br />
lion in the export and import of goods.<br />
Failure to complete the previously autho-<br />
rized 50"" channel and make other improve-<br />
ments can result in the loss of bulk cargos<br />
to other ports.<br /><br />
Over 97 million cubic yards of material<br />
must be dredged during the next 20 years<br />
from Baltimore Harbor channels alone. The<br />
State of Maryland, if it is to deepen and<br />
maintain the Ports’ channels, must assume<br />
responsibility for developing a long term<br />
plan for spoils management including<br />
methods and sites for disposal. This must<br />
include material which is expected to be<br />
generated by private projects. The State has<br />
constructed the Hart/Miller Islands disposal<br />
site to handle the 50"" channel project. This<br />
project will cost over $60 million and<br />
accommodate approximately 55% of the<br />
total harbor dredge material. However,<br />
methods to accommodate the remaining<br />
45% of dredge material expected over the<br />
next twenty years must also be identified by<br />
the MPA. This is especially critical for long<br />
range maintenance dredging and for private<br />
projects. The MPA should not only explore<br />
a wide range of alternatives including over-<br />
boarding clean material, recycling, creating<br />
wetlands and developing upland sites but<br /><br />
~must also identify funding techniques for<br /><br />
both the public and private sector.<br /><br /><br /><br />

struction should begin on another major<br />
MPA project, the 4 berth Masonville Marine<br />
Terminal. Estirates in 1982 called for a total<br />

The Middle Branch Park is a major<br />

on the Patapsco River it touches the South<br />
Baltimore, Westport, Cherry Hill and Brook-<br />
lyn communities. The park combines over<br />
150 acres of completed landfills, existing<br />
City parks and acquisition of derelict shore-<br />

now, full development is expected to take<br />
over ten years. The City began in 1978 mak-<br />

The City should work with owners of<br />
shorefront land to remove derelict<br />

Access to the shoreline can take on<br />
many forms and sizes. While the City will<br />
continue to develop large scale plans for<br />
promenades in the Inner Harbor and Falls<br />
Harbor, there are numerous sites in the har-<br />
bor to develop small scale access points.<br />
Two such sites are under development. At<br />
Hull Street and Boston Street the City has<br />
developed small boating piers and<br />
improved the water’s edge for local resi-<br />
dents. The City will continue to identify<br />
small scale opportunities for public access<br />
to the shoreline.<br /><br />
The City should seek to provide public<br />
access along the shoreline in new or rehabil-<br />
itated residential projects and commercial<br />
buildings on the harbor. This policy has<br />
been successfully implemented in the Inner<br />
Harbor and plans are under development to<br />
continue access in new projects along Piers<br />
4,5, and 6 and to the east in Falls Harbor.<br /><br />
This policy has already been incorpo-<br />
rated into development proposals and the<br />
Federal permits for several projects in Fells<br />
Point and along Boston Street. Public access<br />
to the water has become an important con-<br />
sideration in the review of all residential<br />
and commercial projects along the harbor’s<br />
shoreline.<br /><br />
Other port cities have found that many<br />
people are fascinated by port and industrial<br />
operations and have provided facilities from<br />
which they can view activities safely. The<br />
City has requested the MPA to include such<br />
a facility, perhaps an observation tower, in<br />
its proposed Masonville Marine Terminal.<br />
Other opportunities should be identified<br />
and developed.<br /><br />
An increasing number of people visit<br />
or tour our City via its harbor and a greater<br />
effort must be undertaken to clean-up the<br />
water’s edge. Debris from unkept shorelines<br />
and piers is not only unsightly but provides<br />
a hazard to boaters and shipping. Erosion<br />
causes both landside problems as buildings<br />
and roads are undermined and problems in<br />
the water as sediment fills in channels and<br />
reduces water quality. In cases where ero-<br />
sion or derlict piers are a navigation or pol-<br />
lution problem the City should assist owners<br />
in working with the appropriate State or<br />
Federal agency. Many industrial buildings<br />
located on the waterfront are now highly<br />
visable from the water. It is in their best<br />
interest to improve buildings and shoreline<br />
visable to the public. The City may also<br />
secure funds to remove piers and sunken<br />
boats if they present a hazard to navigation.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

to the shoreline.<br />
<br />
The City should seek to provide public<br />
access along the shoreline in new or rehabil-<br />
itated residential projects and commercial<br />
buildings on the harbor. This policy has<br />
been successfully implemented in the Inner<br />
Harbor and plans are under development to<br />
continue access in new projects along Piers<br />
4,5, and 6 and to the east in Falls Harbor.<br />
<br />
This policy has already been incorpo-<br />
rated into development proposals and the<br />
Federal permits for several projects in Fells<br />
Point and along Boston Street. Public access<br />
to the water has become an important con-<br />
sideration in the review of all residential<br />
and commercial projects along the harbor’s<br />
shoreline.<br />
<br />
Other port cities have found that many<br />
people are fascinated by port and industrial<br />
operations and have provided facilities from<br />
which they can view activities safely. The<br />
City has requested the MPA to include such<br />
a facility, perhaps an observation tower, in<br />
its proposed Masonville Marine Terminal.<br />
Other opportunities should be identified<br />
and developed.<br />
<br />
An increasing number of people visit<br />
or tour our City via its harbor and a greater<br />
effort must be undertaken to clean-up the<br />
water’s edge. Debris from unkept shorelines<br />
and piers is not only unsightly but provides<br />
a hazard to boaters and shipping. Erosion<br />
causes both landside problems as buildings<br />
and roads are undermined and problems in<br />
the water as sediment fills in channels and<br />
reduces water quality. In cases where ero-<br />
sion or derlict piers are a navigation or pol-<br />
lution problem the City should assist owners<br />
in working with the appropriate State or<br />
Federal agency. Many industrial buildings<br />
located on the waterfront are now highly<br />
visable from the water. It is in their best<br />
interest to improve buildings and shoreline<br />
visable to the public. The City may also<br />
secure funds to remove piers and sunken<br />
boats if they present a hazard to navigation.<br />

Baltimore’s<br /><br />
Harbor:<br /><br />
Providing for<br />
the Future<br /><br />
Baltimore’s harbor has been an evolving,<br />
changing resource for over two-hundred<br />
and fifty years. Beginning as a minor port<br />
in the early 18th century, within a hundred<br />
years it had become the front-door to one<br />
of America’s largest cities, a gateway to the<br />
west, home of the clipper ships, and the<br />
birthplace of the railroading industry.<br />
Through the late 19th and early 20th cen-<br />
turies the port experienced expansion of its<br />
industrial base, overland trade, and ship-<br />
ping. However, by the the 1940s and 1950s<br />
the port began to suffer from deteriorated<br />
infrastructure, changes in transportation<br />
methods, and obsolete shipping tech-<br />
niques. A turning point occurred in the<br />
1960s when the Maryland Port Administra-<br />
tion, the City, and the private sector<br />
realized that the waterfront held the poten-<br />
tial to offer a variety of resources to the<br />
public. Changes were initiated to take<br />
advantage of these resources: The port<br />
grew in its ability to meet the changing<br />
demands of world trade. In less than fifteen<br />
years the port had developed over 600<br />
acres of modern, general cargo terminals,<br />
coal export capacity was trebled, and an<br />
interstate highway system tied the port to<br />
the entire east coast and the midwest. But<br />
another, even more remarkable change un-<br />
folded through the 1970s. Residents of the<br />
City, the State of Maryland, and visitors<br />
were reintroduced to the water’s edge. The<br />
redevelopment of the Inner Harbor, Fells<br />
Point, and Canton brought people back to<br />
shop, relax, and live by the harbor, an<br />
opportunity that had been largely missing<br />
for over seventy years. As you have read in<br />
previous chapters, not only was the com-<br />
mercial port rebuilding, but an entire City<br />
and State rediscovered its waterfront and<br />
with it a large part of its history.<br /><br />
With this renewed interest in the harbor<br />
grew another concern, one which had<br />
been reflected in other parts of the<br />
Chesapeake Bay for many years. That is an<br />
interest in recreation at the shore’s edge<br />
and a concern for the quality of the water.<br />
Residents found concern not only in the<br />
economic stability of the port, but began to<br />
insist that the quality of the harbor’s water<br />
and shoreline, also were improved. Resi-<br />
dents and visitors wanted the water clean,<br /><br />
they wanted access to the shoreline when<br />
reasonable, they wanted industry to<br />
improve their respective waterfronts, and<br />
they wanted a variety of experiences at the<br />
water’s edge. Residents celebrated at the<br />
Inner Harbor’s promenade and piers, it has<br />
become the new town square. They wanted<br />
to walk around the edge, watching others,<br />
observing industry, and port activities. They<br />
also wanted to find small public spaces,<br />
near their communities to experience the<br />
waterfront alone or with their neighbors<br />
and families. Boaters wanted the water to<br />
be open and safe. Children and adults<br />
wanted a harbor that could support a<br />
variety of aquatic life. By the 1980’s new<br />
expections were held for Baltimore’s<br />
harbor.<br /><br />
Clearly, the harbor has expanded dramat-<br />
ically as a resource. The traditional methods<br />
of viewing the harbor’s capabilities have<br />
been broadened. But if we are to continue<br />
to utilize the harbor for an ever expanding<br />
number of interest groups then we must<br />
challenge all those involved to become<br />
increasingly responsive to both the issues<br />
concerning this water body and the many<br />
opportunities it offers.<br /><br />
In 1984, Mayor Schaefer, responded to this<br />
need by taking several actions.<br /><br />

The Harbor, and in fact the entire City, had<br />

public waterfront and parks, as we gained<br />
experience in“wildlife management, and as<br />
wetlands were created to provide habitat<br />
there was a need to develop a comprehen-<br />
sive approach to working with the many<br />
resources at hand. In 1984, Mayor Schaefer<br />
appointed a Fish and Wildlife Commission<br />
to develop this aspect of the City’s<br />
resources. The Commission plans to expand<br />
existing programs, develop new opportuni-<br />

broadening wildlife habitat in the City of<br />

Board on improvements to Fort Smallwood,<br />
an active role in support of the City’s<br />

Harbor Expo ’'85.<br /><br />
Marina Master Plan -<br /><br />
Baltimore’s harbor is one of the largest and<br />
most active ports in the country. Over three<br />
thousand commercial vessels call on the<br />
port each year. The introduction of a new<br />
water activity, recreational boating, in a<br />
largely commercial port has raised a number<br />
of concerns regarding congestion, boating<br />
safety, and the standards by which marinas<br />
and other support facilities are developed.<br />
For many years zoning regulations allowed<br />
marinas to develop virtually anywhere along<br />
the shoreline even adjacent to active port<br />
facilities.<br /><br />
The City understands that it is important to<br />
have guidelines for marina development in<br />
order to maintain safety, to support City<br />
redevelopment efforts, and to minimize<br />
impacts on commercial port operations.<br /><br />
Two actions were taken in early 1985 to<br />
address the issue of the safe development<br />
of marinas in the harbor. The first, a Marina<br />
Master Plan was approved by the Planning<br />
Commission. All marina proposals must be<br />
consistent with the master plan. Secondly,<br />
the Mayor and City Council enacted<br />
changes in the Zoning Code which made.<br />
marinas conditional uses in all zoning<br />
districts. Marina proposals must be reviewed<br />
by the Board of Municipal Zoning and<br />
Appeals.<br /><br />
These two actions are important steps<br />
toward keeping the harbor viable for<br />
commercial shipping and providing<br /><br />
opportunities for recreational boating.<br /><br />
Baltimore Harbor Expo ’85 -<br /><br />
The City of Baltimore and much of the State<br />
of Maryland have looked to Baltimore’s<br />
harbor for over 250 years for employment,<br />
housing, recreational activities, and as a tie<br />
to the rest of the world. To celebrate Balti-<br />
more City’s bond with the harbor and the<br />
Chesapeake Bay, Harbor Expo ’85 has been<br />
planned for August 2nd - August 4th, 1985.<br /><br />
Harbor Expo ’85 will focus on the diversity<br />
of the roles that Baltimore’s harbor plays in<br />
the City, State, and nation. Special events<br />
will highlight the Port’s shipping and<br />
manufacturing interests with tours of the<br />
industrial shoreline and visits to marine |<br />
terminals. Citizens will learn of the harbor<br />
and bay’s ecological and natural resources<br />
through two days of Baysic Training, with<br />
courses ranging from testing water quality<br />
to fishing to crabbing and environmental<br />
awareness. Fishing tournaments, crew row-<br />
ing, boating regattas, and waterfront picnics<br />
will reintroduce the public to the harbor’s<br />
sports and recreational potential. Through-<br />
out Harbor Expo ’85 special events, tours,<br />
and activities will provide a unique insight<br />
to Baltimore’s harbor for residents and<br />
visitors. It is anticipated that Harbor Expo<br />
will become an annual celebration.<br /><br />
Baltimore Harbor Endowment -<br />
Created in 1985 initially to support Harbor<br />
Expo '85, the Baltimore Harbor Endowment,<br />
is a non-profit organization which will fund<br />
a variety of programs and projects to<br />
expand the public’s knowledge and use of<br />
the harbor. Directed by the Bay Opportuni-<br />
ties for Baltimore committee, the Baltimore<br />
Harbor Endowment, will provide ongoing<br />
support for Harbor Expo and allow the<br />
private sector to financially support<br />
iImprovements to water quality, public<br />
access projects, and educational programs.<br /><br />
The above programs represent a major<br />
expansion of the resources of Baltimore’s<br />
harbor available to the public. Coupled with<br />
an aggressive port community, economic<br />
development, and new residential and<br />
commercial projects, the water’s edge, the<br />
harbor, and the Chesapeake Bay present a<br />
diversity of opportunities few cities and<br />
states have. Our challenge is to work with<br />
these resources, to develop them carefully _<br />
and with wisdom, and to pass them on to &amp;=<br />
new generations. =<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

port each year. The introduction of a new<br />
water activity, recreational boating, in a<br />
largely commercial port has raised a number<br />
of concerns regarding congestion, boating<br />
safety, and the standards by which marinas<br />
and other support facilities are developed.<br />
For many years zoning regulations allowed<br />
marinas to develop virtually anywhere along<br />
the shoreline even adjacent to active port<br />
facilities.<br />
<br />
The City understands that it is important to<br />
have guidelines for marina development in<br />
order to maintain safety, to support City<br />
redevelopment efforts, and to minimize<br />
impacts on commercial port operations.<br />
<br />
Two actions were taken in early 1985 to<br />
address the issue of the safe development<br />
of marinas in the harbor. The first, a Marina<br />
Master Plan was approved by the Planning<br />
Commission. All marina proposals must be<br />
consistent with the master plan. Secondly,<br />
the Mayor and City Council enacted<br />
changes in the Zoning Code which made.<br />
marinas conditional uses in all zoning<br />
districts. Marina proposals must be reviewed<br />
by the Board of Municipal Zoning and<br />
Appeals.<br />
<br />
These two actions are important steps<br />
toward keeping the harbor viable for<br />
commercial shipping and providing<br />
<br />
opportunities for recreational boating.<br />
<br />
Baltimore Harbor Expo ’85 -<br />
<br />
The City of Baltimore and much of the State<br />
of Maryland have looked to Baltimore’s<br />
harbor for over 250 years for employment,<br />
housing, recreational activities, and as a tie<br />
to the rest of the world. To celebrate Balti-<br />
more City’s bond with the harbor and the<br />
Chesapeake Bay, Harbor Expo ’85 has been<br />
planned for August 2nd - August 4th, 1985.<br />
<br />
Harbor Expo ’85 will focus on the diversity<br />
of the roles that Baltimore’s harbor plays in<br />
the City, State, and nation. Special events<br />
will highlight the Port’s shipping and<br />
manufacturing interests with tours of the<br />
industrial shoreline and visits to marine |<br />
terminals. Citizens will learn of the harbor<br />
and bay’s ecological and natural resources<br />
through two days of Baysic Training, with<br />
courses ranging from testing water quality<br />
to fishing to crabbing and environmental<br />
awareness. Fishing tournaments, crew row-<br />
ing, boating regattas, and waterfront picnics<br />
will reintroduce the public to the harbor’s<br />
sports and recreational potential. Through-<br />
out Harbor Expo ’85 special events, tours,<br />
and activities will provide a unique insight<br />
to Baltimore’s harbor for residents and<br />
visitors. It is anticipated that Harbor Expo<br />
will become an annual celebration.<br />
<br />
Baltimore Harbor Endowment -<br />
Created in 1985 initially to support Harbor<br />
Expo '85, the Baltimore Harbor Endowment,<br />
is a non-profit organization which will fund<br />
a variety of programs and projects to<br />
expand the public’s knowledge and use of<br />
the harbor. Directed by the Bay Opportuni-<br />
ties for Baltimore committee, the Baltimore<br />
Harbor Endowment, will provide ongoing<br />
support for Harbor Expo and allow the<br />
private sector to financially support<br />
iImprovements to water quality, public<br />
access projects, and educational programs.<br />
<br />
The above programs represent a major<br />
expansion of the resources of Baltimore’s<br />
harbor available to the public. Coupled with<br />
an aggressive port community, economic<br />
development, and new residential and<br />
commercial projects, the water’s edge, the<br />
harbor, and the Chesapeake Bay present a<br />
diversity of opportunities few cities and<br />
states have. Our challenge is to work with<br />
these resources, to develop them carefully _<br />
and with wisdom, and to pass them on to &=<br />
new generations. =<br />

1. Gateway Park: Development of the two blocks between<br />
Lafayette- and Lanvale Streets, from Charles Street to the<br />
Fallsway, will create a southern gateway to the Jones Falls<br />
Valley. As a second stage, this park can be extended east to<br />
Guilford Ave., and serve as a major entrance to Downtown.<br /><br />
2. Commercial Potential — The Station: The air rights over the<br />
Pennsylvania Railroad tracks can be developed with motels,<br />
offices, distribution centers, residences, parking garages, and<br />
a heliport. These can extend from North Avenue to Mt. Royal<br />
Avenue and can incorporate a new station, and parcel post<br />
and Railway Express depots as integral parts of the Plan.<br /><br />
3. Residential Potential — Mt. Royal Heights: The high ground<br />
from Mt. Royal Avenue northeast to the Valley has a great<br />
potential for high-rise residential and town house development<br />
when the Plan is put into effect.<br /><br />
4. Landscaped Tracks: The City can acquire a right-to-plant in<br />
railroad areas where land between the tracks is available for<br />
screening planting. Views from the expressway would be<br />
vastly improved, and railroad operations would not be im-<br />
paired.<br /><br />
5. Druid House Restaurant: The southeast promontory of Druid<br />
Lake commands an exciting view of the Valley to the north<br />
and south and of the fascinating 28th-29th Street interchange.<br />
The promontory can be leased by the City for development of<br />
a fine restaurant. The Penn Station area — as seen from<br />
above the Howard Street Bridge<br /><br />
6. Ma and Pa Pond: Realignment of the present Falls Road will — has an exciting commercial potential.<br />
provide space for the pond and for landscape development.<br />
The pond would be stocked with trout. Small boys would By o<br /><br />
come here to sail boats. A sculpture garden would be created ' =<br />
along the edges. =t<br /><br />
7. Highway Link: The City’s Master Street Plan shows a pro-<br />
posed major collector street following the old Maryland and<br />
Pennsylvania Railroad right-of-way, up Wyman Park and<br />
Stony Run from Sisson ,Stre'et north to Lake Avenue. This<br />
highway would be tied into the Jones Falls Valley Road via<br />
the existing tunnel under Sisson Street, thus affording a relief<br />
route for Charles Street down to Maryland Avenue Bridge.<br /><br />

Baltimoreans, even though it is only a stone’s throw from<br />
Falls Road. With selective cutting and planting, the view on<br />

9. The Mill Cafe: Part of the old Mount Vernon Mills can be<br />
remodeled as a restaurant. It now overlooks a delightful ter-<br />
race and another lovely falls. A water wheel could be recon-<br />
structed. Two charming small buildings, dated 1873-79, can<br />
be used as a textile museum.<br /><br />
10. Residential Potential — Falls Cliff: The magnificent view of<br />
the Falls, the Valley, Druid Hill Park, and a skyline backdrop<br />
of the very heart of Downtown from this high bluff gives the<br />
Falls Cliff area an intensive residential potential. The “Mill<br />
Town” across the ravine to the southeast is a handsome ex-<br />
ample of company-built houses, the value of which will in-<br />
crease as the Plan is carried out.<br /><br />
11. Hamden Hill: This promontory has a direct view down the<br /><br />
Valley to the heart of the City. On it is the historic Carroll<br />
House. The top of the hill should be added to Roosevelt Park.<br /><br />
12. The Scenic Road: From Maryland Avenue to the point at<br /><br />
which the present Falls Road leaves the Valley at Hamden,<br /><br />
the road is to be widened under a current City program. The<br />
new portion of the scenic route begins, then, where the pre-<br />
sent Clipper Mill Road continues north from Falls Road.<br />
From this point all the way to Prettyboy Reservoir, the road<br />
will be a small-scaled, steep and winding one, a true scenic<br />
route such as San Martin Drive in Wyman Park or Falls Road<br />
in the county. With removal of the old and obsolete mill build-<br />
ing in this area, the Jones Falls Valley Road underpasses the<br />
expressway and rises on the other side to meet the hill in<br />
Druid Hill Park.<br /><br />
13. Residential Rehabilitation and New Construction: Here<br />
another promontory overlooks the Valley. With the Valley<br />
Park below, a rapid transit station adjacent, Druid Hill Park<br />
across the way, and Roosevelt Park nearby, this area will be<br />
ripe for more intensive development, consistent with the Park<br />
environment and transit and highway access.<br /><br />
14. Park Addition: This area is a logical part of Druid Hill Park<br />
and the Valley concept. It is important visually as well as<br />
locationally that this slope and the small stream at its bottom<br />
be under Park protection. To the east, Brick Hill is another<br />
natural portion of the Park. The houses are old, in many cases<br />
in poor repair, and can be acquired gradually as they come<br />
on the market. A new road connecting the Druid Hill Park<br />
network and the Scenic Road is shown on Brick Hill. From<br />
this height the road can overpass Union Avenue and continue<br />
north along Clipper Avenue. Here a second group of stone<br />
company houses stand close on the west side of the Road. The<br />
City can acquire these over a period of time, lease them back<br />
to present owners, or utilize them for Park purposes. An<br /><br /><br /><br />

agreement with the Woodberry Methodist Church should be<br />
made so that its property could not change its present use or<br />
pass to ownership other than that of the City.<br /><br />
15. Mill Recreation Area: The flood plain upon which the old<br />
Mount Vernon Woodberry Mill #2 stands is ideal for active<br />
recreational purposes such as lacrosse and football. The Olm-<br />
sted Brothers pointed this out in 1902; it still holds true in<br />
1961. The mill buildings have changed hands several times<br />
in the past few years; the City should take advantage of the<br />
next opportunity to acquire the property. The tower with its<br />
handsome cupola could be preserved as a landmark.<br /><br />
16. Woodberry Meadow: Here the Valley concept sinks or<br />
swims. The expressway is hemmed in closely as it narrowly<br />
misses the unsightly factories; the Scenic Road borders the<br />
western edge. This low-lying meadowland will give forth<br />
quickly with moisture-loving plant life. It would be supple-<br />
mented by landscape development so that the meadow will<br />
become a focus for residential neighborhoods on the surround-<br />
ing ridges.<br /><br />
An unimproved 8.8-acre tract in the Jones Falls flood plain at<br />
the 41st Street viaduct should be acquired immediately. The<br />
substantial industry now in this part of the Valley—including<br />
the rag plant, the foundry, the envelope and rubber plants—<br />
shoutd be acquired and razed as the buildings go out of use,<br />
are partly or wholly lost due to natural circumstances or<br />
calamities, or become obsolete. Their eventual elimination is<br />
necessary to the Valley concept.<br /><br />
17. Residential Potential: This area is now partially improved<br />
by small and light industrial concerns, but is still predomi-<br />
nantly open land. The eastern slopes of the Valley rise to give<br />
good views both north and south. The area has good access<br />
to 41st Street, Falls Road, 36th Street, and an existing play-<br />
ground. The industrial traffic and use at this location is in-<br />
compatible with and damaging to the good housing near it.<br /><br /><br />","SECGTION B: 29TH STREET TO 41ST STREET<br />

18. New Apartments and Houses: Open land at the crest of the<br />
Valley wall will serve high-density residential needs, both<br />
apartments and homes.<br /><br />
19. Meadow Park: To the expressway traveller, the wide Wood-<br />
berry Meadow under the 41st Street viaduct will be in pleas-<br />
ant contrast to the narrower confines and steep-sloped views<br />
elsewhere in the Valley. Because the expressway is elevated<br />
at this point, people on the Valley floor can walk under it<br />
easily to the quarry area or to the south and Druid Hill Park.<br /><br />
20. Residential Development: The present light manufacturing<br />
use on this hillside area is almost surrounded by school, play-<br />
ground, and park. The area has greater, higher, and better<br />
use in intensive residential development. {<br /><br />
21. Bend Hill Recreation Area: The Arundel Quarry is not a<br />
very pretty sight today. However, through the eyes .of a<br />
landscape architect can be seen wonderful transformations:<br />
a boating and fishing pond on the lower level ; trees springing<br />
from the now denuded slopes; an observation tower rising<br />
against the 100-foot precipice to thrilling heights overlooking<br />
the Valley and the City; and a restaurant, incorporated in the<br />
design of the tower, to be reached from a parking area on<br />
the upper level just off the Scenic Road. Ice skating and a<br />
sled and ski slope would make the area a year-round enter-<br />
prise. Many of these facilities could be leased out to private<br />
operators thereby absorbing some of the development costs.<br /><br />
22. Camping: The flat hilltop just north of the quarry is an<br />
unusually isolated spot due to its height and steep slopes on<br />
three sides. It is an ideal site for camping. Scouts might find<br />
a good base here from which to hike to Lake Roland and<br />
beyond.<br /><br />
23. Street Improvement: The City has proposed that Shirley<br />
Avenue be extended to Cold Spring Lane. This would become<br />
a natural boundary of the Valley development. The Scenic<br />
Road would connect with it, and park land would reach out<br />
to Greenspring Avenue for pedestrian access. Y<br /><br />
24. Junior High School: The City is now acquiring land for this<br />
school. Both as protection for the school site and as an entry<br />
to the Valley, a minimum of 80’ on each side of Cold Spring<br />
Lane should be acquired and landscaped.<br /><br />
25. Potential Residential Area: This open hilly tract of some<br />
eight acres will be highly desirable residential land overlook-<br />
ing the Valley. Near three public schools, adjacent to an ex-<br />
pressway interchange, and close to the rapid transit line, its<br />
logical use will be for good residences.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Bend H:ll 'recrea,tzon area<br /><br />
26. High Schools: This 69-acre area has been approved for the<br />
use of two new high schools. Again, a minimum width of 80’<br />
should be landscaped on each side of the new Cold Spring<br />
Lane, from Falls Road into the Valley, to provide a sense of<br />
entry as well as to buffer the schools from the highway. The<br />
preservation of the remainder of the high hill just north of<br />
Cold Spring Lane will provide a breath-taking lookout point<br />
for the public. Retaining the hillside will, at the same time,<br />
absorb expressway noise before it reaches classrooms.<br /><br />
27. Camp Small*‘— An Historic Site: The meadow was the site of<br />
a Union Army Camp permanently established early in the<br />
Civil War to protect the railroad bridge over the Jones Falls;<br />
the bridge had been blown up during the Riots of Baltimore.<br />
The area might appeal to the Boy Scouts for the erection of a<br />
permanent camp site. Although it, and a few other areas,<br />
appear to have potential for industrial use, they are even more<br />
important as part of the visual continuity of the Valley Park.<br /><br />
28. Residential Development: A lovely open hillside tract of<br />
some 37 acres, surrounded by public and semi-public uses, this<br />
area is ideal for residential development.<br />","SECTION C: 41ST STREET TO CYLBURN PARK<br />

a boating and fishing pond on the lower level ; trees springing<br />
from the now denuded slopes; an observation tower rising<br />
against the 100-foot precipice to thrilling heights overlooking<br />
the Valley and the City; and a restaurant, incorporated in the<br />
design of the tower, to be reached from a parking area on<br />
the upper level just off the Scenic Road. Ice skating and a<br />
sled and ski slope would make the area a year-round enter-<br />
prise. Many of these facilities could be leased out to private<br />
operators thereby absorbing some of the development costs.<br />
<br />
22. Camping: The flat hilltop just north of the quarry is an<br />
unusually isolated spot due to its height and steep slopes on<br />
three sides. It is an ideal site for camping. Scouts might find<br />
a good base here from which to hike to Lake Roland and<br />
beyond.<br />
<br />
23. Street Improvement: The City has proposed that Shirley<br />
Avenue be extended to Cold Spring Lane. This would become<br />
a natural boundary of the Valley development. The Scenic<br />
Road would connect with it, and park land would reach out<br />
to Greenspring Avenue for pedestrian access. Y<br />
<br />
24. Junior High School: The City is now acquiring land for this<br />
school. Both as protection for the school site and as an entry<br />
to the Valley, a minimum of 80’ on each side of Cold Spring<br />
Lane should be acquired and landscaped.<br />
<br />
25. Potential Residential Area: This open hilly tract of some<br />
eight acres will be highly desirable residential land overlook-<br />
ing the Valley. Near three public schools, adjacent to an ex-<br />
pressway interchange, and close to the rapid transit line, its<br />
logical use will be for good residences.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Bend H:ll 'recrea,tzon area<br />
<br />
26. High Schools: This 69-acre area has been approved for the<br />
use of two new high schools. Again, a minimum width of 80’<br />
should be landscaped on each side of the new Cold Spring<br />
Lane, from Falls Road into the Valley, to provide a sense of<br />
entry as well as to buffer the schools from the highway. The<br />
preservation of the remainder of the high hill just north of<br />
Cold Spring Lane will provide a breath-taking lookout point<br />
for the public. Retaining the hillside will, at the same time,<br />
absorb expressway noise before it reaches classrooms.<br />
<br />
27. Camp Small*‘— An Historic Site: The meadow was the site of<br />
a Union Army Camp permanently established early in the<br />
Civil War to protect the railroad bridge over the Jones Falls;<br />
the bridge had been blown up during the Riots of Baltimore.<br />
The area might appeal to the Boy Scouts for the erection of a<br />
permanent camp site. Although it, and a few other areas,<br />
appear to have potential for industrial use, they are even more<br />
important as part of the visual continuity of the Valley Park.<br />
<br />
28. Residential Development: A lovely open hillside tract of<br />
some 37 acres, surrounded by public and semi-public uses, this<br />
area is ideal for residential development.<br />

SECTION D: CYLBURN PARK TO CITY LINE<br /><br />
29. Bird Refuge — Country Club Pond: With very little effort,<br />
the area between the relocated Jones Falls and the original<br />
stream bed can be made into a delightful pond and bird<br />
refuge. The connection to Falls Road affords an access on the<br />
east to pedestrian traffic.<br /><br />
30. Country Club Apartments: Over 40 acres of rolling, golf<br />
course can be developed for residential use. Highrise towers<br />
would meet many objectives made particularly logical by the<br />
rapid transit and expressway. The hilltop at the northern end<br />
of the site offers views and lookout development possibilities<br />
that should not be lost to the public.<br /><br />
31. Parkway and Potential Development: Northern Parkway,<br />
from Falls Road to Greenspring Avenue, should have parkway<br />
treatment on both sides in order that it might serve as an<br />
entry to the Valley. The slopes are steep on the north side<br />
from Rogers Avenue to Greenspring Avenue, and the stream<br />
in that area needs protection.<br /><br />
32. Private Recreation: The Valley floor reaches out to Falls<br />
Road in this stretch. The area should be scheduled for ac-<br />
quisition as the owners wish to sell. The future use might be<br />
additional privately-operated recreational facilities similar to<br />
those to the north.<br /><br />
33. Stream Conservation: The ravine and creek flowing into the<br />
Valley proper from the west is again an integral part of the<br />
Valley. The terrain is too rough for easy development and<br />
much too beautiful not to be preserved.<br /><br />
34. Meadowbrook: The Mt. Washington Lacrosse Club and the<br />
Meadowbrook swimming pool and skating rink are highly<br />
desirable recreational uses; however, the City should work out<br />
adequate means of assuring future land use control of this<br />
part of the Valley. In the long run, similar recreational<br />
facilities might be developed north of the Kelly Avenue via-<br />
duct. The Mount Washington Methodist Church is of historic<br />
and architectural interest and should be preserved.<br /><br />
35. Western Run Park: The junction of Western Run and Jones<br />
Falls extends back along the Run to the Kelly and Sulgrave<br />
Avenue intersection. This well-travelled intersection is an<br />
important visual focal point for the Park. Retention of the<br />
charming library building on Smith Avenue and the landscape<br />
development of the remainder will make a meaningful junc-<br />
ture of the Jones Falls Valley and Western Run. Along the<br />
Run itself, the City should quickly acquire the remaining por-<br />
tions indicated in Olmsted’s Plan.<br /><br />
36. Rapid Transit: The Northern Central Railway Line makes a<br />
natural route for a rapid transit commuter line. This should<br />
be studied at an early date by the newly instituted Metropoli-<br />
tan Transit Authority. With rapid transit, the intensive<br />
development along the Valley edges makes sense; and vice<br />
versa.<br /><br />
37. Scenic Road: After underpassing the Kelly Avenue viaduct,<br />
the Scenic Road will cling to the lower slopes below Mount<br />
St. Agnes College out to the City Line. A few evergreens in<br />
among the beautiful existing planting on this campus will put<br />
the Road completely out of view from the College.<br /><br />
38. Lake Roland Connection: The stream valley, from the City<br />
Line to Lake Roland, is relatively undeveloped, is almost en-<br />
tirely in the flood plain, and is a vital link in the Valley Plan.<br />
The 450-acre Robert E. Lee Park, known as Lake Roland,<br />
is now owned by the City. It will become a natural destina-<br />
tion for City hikers or riders making use of the Valley.<br /><br />
AREAS NORTH AND SOUTH OF DETAILED STUDY SECTIONS<br /><br />
39. County Extension: The Scenic Road should be extended into<br />
the County, up the draw north of Mount St. Agnes, where the<br />
size and beauty of the beech trees is breath-taking. The road<br />
could have a connection with Smith Avenue. Winding on<br />
through open country, it can join Old Pimlico Road where<br />
that route will underpass the new expressway. Where Old<br />
Pimlico meets Falls Road, a new access into Lake Roland<br />
would be made, thus opening that rugged and beautiful park<br />
to the public.<br /><br />
40. Scenic Road: From the new junction of Old Pimlico and<br />
Falls Roads, the Scenic Road takes advantage of the existing<br />
route of Falls Road, which needs only to have protection ex-<br />
tended along its already beautiful borders. It will make a<br />
magnificent scenic route all the way to Prettyboy Reservoir.<br />
The County can realize this important regional facility with<br />
the acquisition of scenic easements and development rights.<br /><br />
41. Inner Harbor: From Penn Station south to the Harbor are<br />
chances for planting and enhancement of the expressway by<br />
acquisition, by right-to-plant in railway areas, and by careful<br />
control of future developments—both private and public—<br />
adjacent to the expressway. The Harbor itself will eventually<br />
be the dramatic and appropriate terminus for the Jones Falls<br />
Valley. The potential of this area is unlimited. It must be<br />
the subject of a study unto itself. As a natural resource of<br />
historic and visual preeminence, the Inner Harbor is of great<br />
importance to the City of Baltimore.<br />","14<br />

the acquisition of scenic easements and development rights.<br />
<br />
41. Inner Harbor: From Penn Station south to the Harbor are<br />
chances for planting and enhancement of the expressway by<br />
acquisition, by right-to-plant in railway areas, and by careful<br />
control of future developments—both private and public—<br />
adjacent to the expressway. The Harbor itself will eventually<br />
be the dramatic and appropriate terminus for the Jones Falls<br />
Valley. The potential of this area is unlimited. It must be<br />
the subject of a study unto itself. As a natural resource of<br />
historic and visual preeminence, the Inner Harbor is of great<br />
importance to the City of Baltimore.<br />

Society, an organization devoted to civic betterment, and<br />
newly created by Theodore Marburg, retained the Olmsted<br />
Brothers, the top landscape architects of that era, to make a<br />
report on the development of public grounds in Baltimore.<br />
Their report, published in 1904, continues to this day as the<br />
framework for open space and park planning for Baltimore<br />
City and its environs. The Approved Park Plan of the City is<br />
based upon the Olmsted Plan as updated by that firm in 1926.<br /><br />
Much of the Olmsted Plan was realized by the City. Herring<br />
Run Park in East Baltimore and Gwynn’s Falls Park in West<br />
Baltimore are substantially complete. The third major stream-<br />
valley system recommended by the Olmsteds for Jones Falls<br />
Valley, serving the north and northwest part of the City, has<br />
never been completed.<br /><br />
Today, active construction on the Jones Falls Expressway has<br />
refocused attention on this forgotten valley. The amazing<br />
fact is that a tremendous amount of open land still exists. It<br />
seemed more important than ever that the Valley, through<br />
which some 65-70,000 Baltimore motorists would travel daily,<br />
be studied to determine its future.<br /><br />
As a result, the Board of Recreation and Parks of the City of<br />
Baltimore, and the same Municipal Art Society, authorized the<br />
Planning Council of the Greater Baltimore Committee to<br />
explore the proper land uses, and development potential of<br />
the Valley. Major emphasis was to be on the possibility of<br />
carrying out the early park concept.<br /><br />
While the 1904 report proposed a continuous park from Mary-<br />
land Avenue to Lake Roland, the 1926 proposal eliminated<br />
the strip park south of Bend Hill, the north side of Woodberry.<br />
This represented a weakening of the concept. On detailed<br />
study the continuity of the Valley’s park-like character was<br />
seen to be essential from Penn Station to Lake Roland and on<br />
to the Beltway. Interrupt this continuity at any point, and the<br />
concept will cease to have validity.<br /><br />
Though detailed analysis in the present study was limited to<br /><br />
the area between Penn Station and the city line, it is obvious<br /><br />
that the Valley’s significance — both as a City landmark and<br />
regional geographic feature — does not stop at these points.<br />
South to the harbor, an extension of green could be placed<br />
along the edges of the expressway as the continuity of the<br />
concept and as a pleasant, visual edge for Downtown. North<br />
of the city line, the connection into Lake Roland is absolutely<br />
necessary for the pedestrian linkage to this City-owned, 450-<br />
acre park. The Scenic Road, utilizing existing Falls Road<br />
north to the Prettyboy Reservoir, is still unspoiled and a great<br />
opportunity for the taking.<br /><br /><br /><br />
In 1904 the Olmsted Brothers had a plan for Jones Falls Valley.<br /><br /><br />","Planning for the Valley began in 1902. The Municipal Art<br />
Society, an organization devoted to civic betterment, and<br />
newly created by Theodore Marburg, retained the Olmsted<br />
Brothers, the top landscape architects of that era, to make a<br />
report on the development of public grounds in Baltimore.<br />
Their report, published in 1904, continues to this day as the<br />
framework for open space and park planning for Baltimore<br />
City and its environs. The Approved Park Plan of the City is<br />
based upon the Olmsted Plan as updated by that firm in 1926.<br />
<br />
Much of the Olmsted Plan was realized by the City. Herring<br />
Run Park in East Baltimore and Gwynn’s Falls Park in West<br />
Baltimore are substantially complete. The third major stream-<br />
valley system recommended by the Olmsteds for Jones Falls<br />
Valley, serving the north and northwest part of the City, has<br />
never been completed.<br />

Analysis A great deal of planning analysis underlies the Valley<br />
Plan. What will be the impact of the Expressway? Should<br />
the Valley be used for industry? Must the entire Valley be<br />
cleared to provide continuity for the Park? What would be<br />
the costs and benefits? How could the Plan be implemented?<br />
These questions and many others were studied and considered<br />
before the Plan could be completed. Though only a summary<br />
can be shown here, careful scrutiny of details by the City is<br />
necessary.<br /><br />
The Impact of the Expressway on the Valley Impact studies of<br />
expressways elsewhere have shown great increases in develop-<br />
ment at the interchanges, particularly in industrial uses where<br />
open, level land was available. The actual design of the<br />
expressway was studied. Its impact could be good, or could<br />
be very damaging to the adjacent land uses. The result of not<br />
putting the Valley Plan into effect will mean some increases<br />
in industrial use, but industry on the same hit-or-miss basis<br />
as in the past.<br /><br />
Alternative Land Uses The predominant land use in the Valley<br />
is already public. City-owned property — including parks,<br />
playgrounds, schools, and the expressway — outstrip all other<br />
uses by a tremendous margin. Other significant uses are resi-<br />
dential and institutional. Primarily open and undeveloped<br />
land still numbers in the hundreds of acres; much of it still<br />
has great natural beauty.<br /><br />
How much of the Valley could be developed for new industry?<br />
When the flood plain, steep topography, and land-locked sites<br />
are all considered, there are only about 50 really good acres<br /><br />

for potential industrial use. These are scattered among 11<br />
or 12 locations. Even some of these are partially within the<br />
flood plain or in residential zones.<br /><br />
The present industry was examined. Although some concerns<br />
are substantial, together they provide less than 2500 jobs. In<br />
the course of the next 20 years of the Plan, many of the indus-<br />
tries will move through need for more space, changes in<br />
ownership, and obsolescence of structures. Therefore it was<br />
considered not impractical to gradually retire the Valley from<br />
industrial use.<br /><br />
The facts are that industrial opportunity here is a pittance.<br />
And, in the overall picture of the Valley, industry is not a<br />
large existing use. With planned industrial parks opening else-<br />
where in the City, the marginal sites offered by the Valley<br />
will continue to suffer from their historic competitive disad-<br />
vantage in spite of the expressway.<br /><br />
Continuity of the Concept The big decision in the planning<br />
process was that the Valley had to be continuous to be feasible<br />
as a Plan. Schemes in which the Park was interrupted were<br />
tried and rejected. They fell apart as mere spot park pro-<br />
posals. The concept of a stream valley park from the Inner<br />
Harbor to Lake Roland and beyond has integrity, historic<br />
significance, and validity in both City and regional aspects of<br /><br />

<br />
Analysis A great deal of planning analysis underlies the Valley<br />
Plan. What will be the impact of the Expressway? Should<br />
the Valley be used for industry? Must the entire Valley be<br />
cleared to provide continuity for the Park? What would be<br />
the costs and benefits? How could the Plan be implemented?<br />
These questions and many others were studied and considered<br />
before the Plan could be completed. Though only a summary<br />
can be shown here, careful scrutiny of details by the City is<br />
necessary.<br />
<br />
The Impact of the Expressway on the Valley Impact studies of<br />
expressways elsewhere have shown great increases in develop-<br />
ment at the interchanges, particularly in industrial uses where<br />
open, level land was available. The actual design of the<br />
expressway was studied. Its impact could be good, or could<br />
be very damaging to the adjacent land uses. The result of not<br />
putting the Valley Plan into effect will mean some increases<br />
in industrial use, but industry on the same hit-or-miss basis<br />
as in the past.<br />
<br />
Alternative Land Uses The predominant land use in the Valley<br />
is already public. City-owned property — including parks,<br />
playgrounds, schools, and the expressway — outstrip all other<br />
uses by a tremendous margin. Other significant uses are resi-<br />
dential and institutional. Primarily open and undeveloped<br />
land still numbers in the hundreds of acres; much of it still<br />
has great natural beauty.<br />
<br />
How much of the Valley could be developed for new industry?<br />
When the flood plain, steep topography, and land-locked sites<br />
are all considered, there are only about 50 really good acres<br />

for potential industrial use. These are scattered among 11<br />
or 12 locations. Even some of these are partially within the<br />
flood plain or in residential zones.<br />
<br />
The present industry was examined. Although some concerns<br />
are substantial, together they provide less than 2500 jobs. In<br />
the course of the next 20 years of the Plan, many of the indus-<br />
tries will move through need for more space, changes in<br />
ownership, and obsolescence of structures. Therefore it was<br />
considered not impractical to gradually retire the Valley from<br />
industrial use.<br />
<br />
The facts are that industrial opportunity here is a pittance.<br />
And, in the overall picture of the Valley, industry is not a<br />
large existing use. With planned industrial parks opening else-<br />
where in the City, the marginal sites offered by the Valley<br />
will continue to suffer from their historic competitive disad-<br />
vantage in spite of the expressway.<br />
<br />
Continuity of the Concept The big decision in the planning<br />
process was that the Valley had to be continuous to be feasible<br />
as a Plan. Schemes in which the Park was interrupted were<br />
tried and rejected. They fell apart as mere spot park pro-<br />
posals. The concept of a stream valley park from the Inner<br />
Harbor to Lake Roland and beyond has integrity, historic<br />
significance, and validity in both City and regional aspects of<br />
<br />
‘geography and planning.<br />
<br />

cost analysis, the general magnitude of costs is felt to be<br />
realistic. For acquisition cost, recent comparable sales were<br />
used for unimproved land. For improved parcels, 1960 assess-<br />

<br />
The final stage, over 20 or more years, would add an additional<br />
91 acres to the Park system at a cost of about $12.3 million;<br />
$2.7 million is estimated for park and recreational develop-<br />
ment. The 1960 assessment of real property of the final stage<br />

Implementation and Financing The Plan can be achieved through<br />
a step-by-step process of implementation. That process is<br />
itemized under Recommendations.<br /><br />
Various techniques and sources of funds are available. Out-<br />
right acquisition of property is indicated for most of the Val-<br />
ley within the City. For some portions in the City, the pur-<br />
chasing of development rights, made possible by recent State<br />
legislation, may be appropriate. Such uses as the Woodberry<br />
Methodist Church, the Mt. Washington Methodist Church, the<br />
Meadowbrook Club, and the Mt. Washington Lacrosse Club<br />
can be ensured by this method, or by purchase and lease-back.<br />
Many of the houses can be acquired in the same manner. Most<br />
of the land for the Park in Baltimore County can be protected<br />
as open park space by acquisition of scenic easements or<br />
development rights.<br /><br />
Major financing of the Valley Park in the City must be by a<br />
local bond issue. However, 50-50 Federal funds may be avail-<br />
able for portions of the Jones Falls Valley Road. Federal<br />
money ig already available under the 90-10 ratio for landscap-<br />
ing the expressway.<br /><br />
In addition to these Federal funds, there is likely to be a new<br />
and direct aid for the Valley Plan. The Williams Bill (S. 858,<br />
87th Congress sponsored by Senator Harrison A. Williams, Jr.<br />
(D., N.J.)) was introduced in the Senate on February 9, 1961.<br />
It calls for the authorization of grants up to 25-35% of acqui-<br />
sition costs to help finance the preservation of open-space land<br />
“which is of regional or area-wide importance . . .” President<br />
Kennedy called for passage of this bill in his message to Con-<br />
gress. When the bill is enacted into law, Baltimore can be<br />
ready with one of the first qualifying plans. Recently Senator<br />
Williams said to a meeting of the Maryland Governor’s Con-<br />
ference on Recreation and Parks: “We must start making our<br />
parks serve the larger effort of improving the whole quality<br />

In accordance with our contract dated 26<br />

completed its study of the Jones Falls Valley.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
The accompanying report substantiates the<br />
Council’s strong feeling that herein lies a<br />
critical and timely opportunity for the Balti-<br />
more Region. Positive action toward realiza-<br />
tion of this plan will place Baltimore in the<br />
forefront of a national awakening to the<br />
aesthetic and practical value of parks and<br />
open spaces.<br /><br />
The Planning Council believes that this Plan<br />
is feasible. It will, in the long run, benefit<br />
the City and Region increasingly with the<br />
years, creating an environment we will all be<br />
proud to pass on to our descendents.<br /><br />

THE<br /><br />
Established in 1922, the chosen name, Oriole, and<br />
the same management, have continued to be asso-<br />
ciated with and a part of Baltimore. Starting in one<br />
location—at 32 S. Calvert St., by serving Baltimoreans<br />
well, three large establishments are now required.<br />
We omit the astronomical figures that would be re-<br />
quired to record how many meals, how many oysters,<br />
how many pats of butter, lumps of sugar, cups of<br />
coffee, etc., we have served. Rather, let us merely<br />
remind you that the great volume of business of the<br />
Orioles is but the result of comsistently serving good<br />
food, modsrately priced, in clean, inviting surroundings.<br /><br />

Oriole Cafeteria Number<br />
One, since 1924 at 22 Light<br />
Street, supplanted by the<br />
new Oriole at 17 East Balti-<br />
more Street, serves the finan-<br />
cial and business districts.<br /><br />
Number Two, at 306 North<br />
Howard Street, is convenient<br />
to the Lexington-Howard<br />
retail shopping district. Es-<br />
Many<br />
* early shoppers breakfast here<br /><br />
while awaiting the opening<br />
of nearby stores.<br /><br />
The third Oriole Cafeteria,<br />
established at 11 East North<br />
Avenue, is in the heart of<br />
the uptown business and<br />
shopping center where, since<br />
1933, it has served this busy<br /><br />
Community. North Avenue near Charles<br /><br /><br /><br />

Established in 1922, the chosen name, Oriole, and<br />
the same management, have continued to be asso-<br />
ciated with and a part of Baltimore. Starting in one<br />
location—at 32 S. Calvert St., by serving Baltimoreans<br />
well, three large establishments are now required.<br />
We omit the astronomical figures that would be re-<br />
quired to record how many meals, how many oysters,<br />
how many pats of butter, lumps of sugar, cups of<br />
coffee, etc., we have served. Rather, let us merely<br />
remind you that the great volume of business of the<br />
Orioles is but the result of comsistently serving good<br />
food, modsrately priced, in clean, inviting surroundings.<br />

DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAN<br /><br />
The purpose of the General Development Plan presented here is to pro-<br />
vide information and guidance for the many public and private decisions<br />
which will determine the future form of Baltimore’s metropolitan area.<br />
This plan envisions a more desirable environment for living which this<br />
Region might offer. It is a general suggestion for encouraging sound de-<br />
velopment of our environment. It is long-range, looking ahead twenty to<br />
twenty-five years. The plan recommends a land use pattern and major<br />
public facilities. It is not a zoning map; the power to zone is exercised by<br />
local government.<br /><br />
The plan is the culmination of years of study and research by the<br />
Regional Planning Council, local planning bodies, and other representatives<br />
of governments in the Region. It consists of a set of recommendations,<br />
prepared pursuant to state law, to provide assistance to units of local<br />
government and the state government in meeting the challenge of inevitable<br />
growth. It focuses on problems and opportunities which are common to<br />
several units of government or which affect more than one unit of govern-<br />
ment. ' Its success depends on local action by local units of government,<br />
both as they act individually and as they act through their representatives<br />
on regional and state bodies.<br /><br />
The Regional Planning Council, in cooperation with the planning staffs<br />
of the local and state governments, is undertaking further analyses of the<br />
major elements of the General Development Plan. These studies will be<br />
made public from time to time as they are completed.<br /><br />
The major elements of the plan reflect goals for the future physical<br />
development of the area. The plan provides for well-coordinated develop-<br />
ment of these elements, designed to make the best use of the land. These<br />
elements are briefly described below.<br /><br />
Residential Development<br /><br />

The basic highway network includes both interregional and intraregional .<br />
facilities. Only freeways, expressways, and major urban and rural arterial<br />
roads are shown in the plan. The network has been planned to encourage<br />
development where it would be least costly to provide public services, and<br />
to deter development where it would destroy prize open-space areas or<br />
would be undesirable in other ways.<br /><br />
The principal additions to the existing system acknowledge the major<br />
growth expected toward Columbia and Washington to the southwest, and<br />
toward Wilmington and Philadelphia to the northeast. The new roads<br />
include a new and better U. S. Route 1 extending northeast from the city;<br />
Northwest and Liberty Expressways into the northwest part of the Region;<br />
I-70N westerly in the general location of U. S. Route 40; an improved Route<br />
29 and a continuation of I-95 through Howard County; and the Arundel<br />
Freeway facilitating transportation in the urban portion of Anne Arundel<br />
County and connecting with the Bay Bridge. Other major features include<br />
links from the Beltway into the waterfront and industrial areas of Marley<br />
Neck, Sparrows Point, Back River, and White Marsh; a future second<br />
harbor crossing; and three connector freeways across the southern part of<br />
the Region. In the future, major rural highways could connect the fringes<br />
of the Region from Annapolis to Westminster, and then east across the<br />
northern area to Aberdeen.<br /><br />
The mass transit system will provide vastly improved transportation<br />
service for people travelling within the Region. The 65-mile rail portion<br />
of the transit system consists of a loop surrounding the core of Baltimore,<br />
and radial lines reaching from the inner-city loop outward along six major<br />
development corridors. Subsequent transit extensions are possible to<br />
Aberdeen, Annapolis, Columbia, and Washington when patronage warrants.<br /><br />
The rail rapid-transit system would be supported by a complex of<br />
modern commuter express buses on exclusive rights of way and on the<br />
freeways, and improved feeder bus lines from suburban residential areas<br />
to the rail transit stations.<br /><br />
ANNES good transportation facilities, and convenient shopping areas. The plan Centers for the Region<br />

beyond the high density areas and extending along principal transportation<br />
corridors; and wider low density areas. Rural areas identify land recom-<br />
mended to remain predominantly farmland.<br /><br />
These density proposals refer to overall intensity of development within<br />
a sizable area. Many areas might contain not just one form of housing but<br />
a reasonable and practicable variety of housing types.<br /><br />
Not every area shown will actually be developed. The plan leaves ade-<br />
quate room for choice.<br /><br />
Open Space<br /><br />
The open space element of the plan provides many benefits for the<br />
Region’s inhabitants. First, it recognizes the rural values of the Region.<br />
In addition, it preserves features of the natural environment to make the<br />
area more beautiful, protect natural resources, safeguard the water supply,<br />
and provide land for recreation and leisure. One of its major purposes is<br />
to serve as the background for more livable communities which will be<br />
developed within the open space pattern.<br /><br />
There is still much open land because pressures for development have<br />
not reached all of it. However, there is limited open space which is now<br />
permanently reserved for the future. The plan provides a guide for the<br />
public action which is needed to safeguard this natural heritage.<br /><br />
The plan defines three categories of open space. One is the primary<br />
system which requires either acquisition or some form of public protection<br />
of land which is subject to early development pressures, or which protects<br />
public water supply watersheds, or contains unique natural features. The<br />
primary system provides an interconnected series of reserves and recreation<br />
areas which link together major existing recreation areas and open spaces,<br />
areas of exceptional natural beauty, scenic and historic sites, and flood<br />
plains. It generally follows the major stream and river valleys. Other parts<br />
of the primary system include other water bodies, smaller scenic valleys and<br />
historic sites, available open space around the headwaters of other rivers,<br />
and scattered but significant public recreation sites along the bay.<br /><br />
activities, educational facilities, and numerous other aspects of daily urban<br />
living.<br /><br />
The plan shows a development pattern which can improve these oppor-<br />
tunities and make them more available to more people.<br /><br />
A strong central core for the Region is explicit in the plan — from the<br />
strengthened highway network and the rail mass-transit system to the<br />
revitalized high-density residential districts in the central area. These<br /><br />
. features work to reinforce the core as a thriving financial, business, resi-<br />
dential, and cultural center supporting the economy of the Region, and<br />
serving as a vital center of activity around the clock.<br /><br />
In addition to a strong downtown, a number of town centers are proposed<br />
to serve as secondary concentrations of business and other activity. These<br />
centers will offer a variety of urban opportunities including retail, com-<br />
mercial services, and entertainment facilities. They can include govern-<br />
ment, educational, institutional, and residential complexes. Many, like<br />
the centers .of Towson and Annapolis, exist today. They are all located<br />
amid large existing and future communities and are closely coordinated<br />
with the transportation system, both highway and transit.<br /><br />
As the growth of the area continues, new carefully planned centers<br />
should be created in presently undeveloped areas to serve these new com-<br />
munities.<br /><br />
Industrial Land<br /><br />
Good industrial land is essential for the economic growth of any populous<br />
region. Thousands of additional acres of land must be reserved for indus-<br />
trial expansion in coming decades. At the present time, the largest in-<br />
dustrial establishments are located around the Patapsco waterfront. Smaller<br />
industrial developments are located throughout the Region.<br /><br />
Good transportation, water and sewer facilities, and other services are<br />
necessary for industry. Areas proposed for industrial use in the plan are<br />
along major highway and rail networks, at critical transportation intersec-<br /><br />
_ SECONDARY : FREEWAY , s A secondary system defines additional desirable natural areas not tions, and around the port. Major expansion is planned ultil.nately between<br />

- CONSERVATION essscscee POSSIBLE TRANSIT EXTENSION sparse and restricted for the protection of natural resources or amenities. in the corridor between Baltimore and Washington near the proposed I-95<br /><br /><br /><br />
Most of the secondary system, and practically all of the conservation areas,<br />
would remain in private ownership.<br /><br />
Transportation<br /><br />
The transportation network provides mobility for the citizens and visitors<br />
of the Region. It determines how quickly and conveniently people can<br />
travel within the Region. It guides growth by providing access to land<br />
areas, and it represents the largest single public capital investment in the<br />
Region. The two major features in the system are highways and mass<br />
transit, both bus and rail.<br /><br />
and Baltimore-Washington Parkway.<br /><br />
Much of the success of the General Development Plan depends on the<br />
people who live in the Region. Through their day-to-day decisions of where<br />
to shop, where to build an apartment development, how to get to work,<br />
where to build an industrial park, what to do on the weekend, the people<br />
who live here, work here, invest here, and shop here will provide the<br />
demand for which the public agencies will make their decisions.<br /><br />
This plan can offer a long-range guide to aid the people who must make<br /><br />
these decisions. G33q d<br />

beyond the high density areas and extending along principal transportation<br />
corridors; and wider low density areas. Rural areas identify land recom-<br />
mended to remain predominantly farmland.<br />
<br />
These density proposals refer to overall intensity of development within<br />
a sizable area. Many areas might contain not just one form of housing but<br />
a reasonable and practicable variety of housing types.<br />
<br />
Not every area shown will actually be developed. The plan leaves ade-<br />
quate room for choice.<br />
<br />
Open Space<br />
<br />
The open space element of the plan provides many benefits for the<br />
Region’s inhabitants. First, it recognizes the rural values of the Region.<br />
In addition, it preserves features of the natural environment to make the<br />
area more beautiful, protect natural resources, safeguard the water supply,<br />
and provide land for recreation and leisure. One of its major purposes is<br />
to serve as the background for more livable communities which will be<br />
developed within the open space pattern.<br />
<br />
There is still much open land because pressures for development have<br />
not reached all of it. However, there is limited open space which is now<br />
permanently reserved for the future. The plan provides a guide for the<br />
public action which is needed to safeguard this natural heritage.<br />
<br />
The plan defines three categories of open space. One is the primary<br />
system which requires either acquisition or some form of public protection<br />
of land which is subject to early development pressures, or which protects<br />
public water supply watersheds, or contains unique natural features. The<br />
primary system provides an interconnected series of reserves and recreation<br />
areas which link together major existing recreation areas and open spaces,<br />
areas of exceptional natural beauty, scenic and historic sites, and flood<br />
plains. It generally follows the major stream and river valleys. Other parts<br />
of the primary system include other water bodies, smaller scenic valleys and<br />
historic sites, available open space around the headwaters of other rivers,<br />
and scattered but significant public recreation sites along the bay.<br />
<br />
activities, educational facilities, and numerous other aspects of daily urban<br />
living.<br />
<br />
The plan shows a development pattern which can improve these oppor-<br />
tunities and make them more available to more people.<br />
<br />
A strong central core for the Region is explicit in the plan — from the<br />
strengthened highway network and the rail mass-transit system to the<br />
revitalized high-density residential districts in the central area. These<br />
<br />
. features work to reinforce the core as a thriving financial, business, resi-<br />
dential, and cultural center supporting the economy of the Region, and<br />
serving as a vital center of activity around the clock.<br />
<br />
In addition to a strong downtown, a number of town centers are proposed<br />
to serve as secondary concentrations of business and other activity. These<br />
centers will offer a variety of urban opportunities including retail, com-<br />
mercial services, and entertainment facilities. They can include govern-<br />
ment, educational, institutional, and residential complexes. Many, like<br />
the centers .of Towson and Annapolis, exist today. They are all located<br />
amid large existing and future communities and are closely coordinated<br />
with the transportation system, both highway and transit.<br />
<br />
As the growth of the area continues, new carefully planned centers<br />
should be created in presently undeveloped areas to serve these new com-<br />
munities.<br />
<br />
Industrial Land<br />
<br />
Good industrial land is essential for the economic growth of any populous<br />
region. Thousands of additional acres of land must be reserved for indus-<br />
trial expansion in coming decades. At the present time, the largest in-<br />
dustrial establishments are located around the Patapsco waterfront. Smaller<br />
industrial developments are located throughout the Region.<br />
<br />
Good transportation, water and sewer facilities, and other services are<br />
necessary for industry. Areas proposed for industrial use in the plan are<br />
along major highway and rail networks, at critical transportation intersec-<br />
<br />
_ SECONDARY : FREEWAY , s A secondary system defines additional desirable natural areas not tions, and around the port. Major expansion is planned ultil.nately between<br />

<br />
- CONSERVATION essscscee POSSIBLE TRANSIT EXTENSION sparse and restricted for the protection of natural resources or amenities. in the corridor between Baltimore and Washington near the proposed I-95<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Most of the secondary system, and practically all of the conservation areas,<br />
would remain in private ownership.<br />
<br />
Transportation<br />
<br />
The transportation network provides mobility for the citizens and visitors<br />
of the Region. It determines how quickly and conveniently people can<br />
travel within the Region. It guides growth by providing access to land<br />
areas, and it represents the largest single public capital investment in the<br />
Region. The two major features in the system are highways and mass<br />
transit, both bus and rail.<br />
<br />
and Baltimore-Washington Parkway.<br />
<br />
Much of the success of the General Development Plan depends on the<br />
people who live in the Region. Through their day-to-day decisions of where<br />
to shop, where to build an apartment development, how to get to work,<br />
where to build an industrial park, what to do on the weekend, the people<br />
who live here, work here, invest here, and shop here will provide the<br />
demand for which the public agencies will make their decisions.<br />
<br />
This plan can offer a long-range guide to aid the people who must make<br />
<br />
these decisions. G33q d<br />

/1982<br /><br /><br /><br />
When the Regional Planning Council was established in 1963 by the State Legislature, it was charged with<br />
preparing a General Development Plan for the Baltimore Region. The purpose of this plan is best stated by the Act<br />
which established the Council: ”An opportunity must be provided for the several units of government within the area<br />
to work together with the State and private agencies toward the solution of their problems. In order to deal with these<br />
matters on a rational and sound basis, they must be considered within the framework of a general development plan<br />
for the area.” (Article 78D, Section 1.) Additionally, the Act establishes the general contents of the plan, as follows:<br />
”The plan shall be based upon comprehensive surveys and studies of land use, transportation, public utilities,<br />
governmental facilities and services, and natural resources. It shall take into account social and economic factors,<br />
conditions, and trends that are relevant to the probable future development of the area.” (Article 78D, Section 12, (a).)<br /><br />
All three prior General Development Plans have followed this general outline while varying in thrust and de-<br />
tail to meet the major issues of regional importance at the time of their preparation. The 1982 General Development<br />
Plan is no exception and addresses the problems of implementing necessary programs in a time of reduced fiscal<br />
resources, declining growth and a sluggish economy. The how and what to implement is the single most important<br />
issue facing the state, region, and local governments at this time. Establishment of priorities, both in terms of<br />
programs and facilities, is critical and must be matched by the means to secure the funds to pay for them. High<br />
interest rates are making it more difficult for the state and local governments to raise funds for capital projects and<br />
have also affected business expansion and formation with depressing effects on tax revenues. Additionally,<br />
decreasing federal financial assistance is placing increased burdens on state and local resources.<br /><br />
Unfortunately, while revenue sources are decreasing or becoming more expensive to obtain, demands for<br />
government expenditures are as high, or higher, than ever. In the era of rapid suburban growth following the Second<br />
World War, enormous expenditures for new public facilities of all kinds were required to keep pace with needs, while<br />
funds for maintenance of existing facilities were reduced. The facilities built during the fifties and sixties are in need<br />
of repair and, in some cases, enlargement, while the other facilities on which maintenance had been deferred are in<br />
great need of repair and, in many cases, replacement. Additionally, many older communities need revitalization and<br />
new facilities.<br /><br />
In addressing these and other problems, many of which are not related to the physical facilities of the region but<br />
to the social and economic needs of the residents, the Regional Planning Council has concentrated on seven major<br />
areas of concern, i.e., Transportation, Economic Development, Housing, Land Use, Energy, Environment, and<br />
Human Services. Each area of concern defines the most critical problems, examines program and project priorities,<br />
and suggests a number of ways by which the necessary funding can be obtained. Following this analysis, a series of<br />
goals are established with accompanying policies and strategies to achieve these goals. In many respects, the point of<br />
view of this GDP is shorter than the usual 20 year range of previous plans as it is more involved with the short range (5<br />
-10 years) view associated with plan and program implementation. However, many of the goals are long range in<br />
nature and will require a considerable length of time before they can be achieved. On May 27, 1982, Governor Hughes<br />
issued an Executive Order containing 72 major policies which will be used by state agencies as they make decisions<br />
affecting development in Maryland. The goals and policies of the General Development Plan are consistent with and<br />
serve to reaffirm and support the policies of the Executive Order.<br /><br />
In the following discussion, each of the areas of concern will be summarized with particular reference to the<br />
issues and goals. These summaries are necessarily very brief and contain only the most critical issues, goals, and<br />
findings. The reader interested in the policies and strategies developed to reach the recommended goals is referred to<br />
the pertinent volumes which accompany this summary or to the volume of goals and policies which contains all of<br /><br />
the policies and strategies recommended by the Regional Planning Council.<br /><br />

Superimposed, in black, upon these major areas are a number of special areas.<br />
While seemingly unrelated, all of these special areas have an impact on the type or<br />
form of development which can be accommodated. These special areas are:<br /><br />

controlled to protect quality of surface water reservoirs or ground water<br />
resources.<br /><br />

Highway and Transit Facilities - new interstate and other highway and<br />
transit projects on new locations which are programmed for construction<br />
or project planning; does not include widening, resurfacing, or similar<br /><br />
improvements.<br /><br /><br /><br />
In contrast to prior General Development Plans which<br />
contained major land use analyses and recommendations, the<br />
1982 Plan restricts itself to an examination of the degree to which<br />
local and regional plans are being implemented. Since 1977, all<br />
of the jurisdictions in the region have revised or adopted plans<br />
containing the concepts of centralized development and growth<br />
management which were the major precepts of the 1977 General<br />
Development Plan. As a result, the major land use goals were<br />
considered to be valid and are included in the 1982 Plan. The<br />
basic development goal is as follows:<br /><br />
THE REGION’S RESOURCES SHOULD BE<br />
MANAGED TO PROMOTE AND ACHIEVE A MORE<br />
CENTRALIZED DEVELOPMENT PATTERN.<br />
SIMULTANEOUSLY, PUBLIC ACTIONS SHOULD<br />
BE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE, MAINTAIN, AND<br />
REVITALIZE EXISTING COMMUNITIES. PUBLIC<br />
POLICIES SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE GROWTH<br />
OF METROCENTER AND OTHER TOWN AND<br />
COMMUNITY CENTERS. THE RURAL SERVICE<br />
AREA SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR FARMING<br />
AND FORESTRY, PUBLIC WATERSHED<br />
PROTECTION AND MAJOR PUBLIC PARKLAND,<br />
AND NEW WELL-PLANNED DEVELOPMENT<br />
SHOULD UTILIZE LAND RESOURCES WITHIN<br />
EXISTING COMMUNITIES AND IN CAREFULLY<br />
STAGED NEW GROWTH AREAS IN SEQUENCE<br />
WITH THE ORDERLY PROVISION OF PUBLIC<br />
SERVICES AND FACILITIES. BALTIMORE CITY<br />
SHOULD RECEIVE A GREATER SHARE OF THE<br />
REGION’S GROWTH.<br /><br />
With general agreement as to development form and<br />
location, the critical element is the degree to which this<br />
development pattern is being achieved, with particular reference<br />
to the provision and scheduling of public facilities. The ability<br />
to acquire the necessary capital resources to provide these<br />
facilities is also a key issue addressed by the 1982 General<br />
Development Plan. These issues were addressed by examining<br />
the means by which the local governments in the region are<br />
considering or are using innovative techniques to provide<br />
capital resources including greater cooperation with the private<br />
sector, and by examining the degree to which the plans and<br />
programs for sewerage and transportation facilities serve to meet<br />
the development goals of the local jurisdictions.<br /><br />
A wide range of development policies exists in the region<br />
together with measures designed to implement them. In<br />
implementing these policies local governments have become<br />
dependent, to varying degrees, on infusion of federal and state<br />
financing required to subsidize urban renewal and support the<br />
construction, reconstruction, and maintenance of public facility<br />
systems. The withdrawal, or substantial reduction of federal aid,<br />
threatens severe cutbacks in development policy<br />
implementation. This analysis represents an initial attempt to<br />
define how the various jurisdictions intend or are coping with<br /><br />
these realities. The following observations have resulted from<br />
this preliminary investigation:<br /><br />
B ILarger amounts of private capital may become<br />
available to help undertake all phases of land<br />
development, including basic infrastructure, than in<br />
the past. Developers with access to large sources of<br />
investment funds, coupled with a vested interest in<br />
the region, can open varied new routes to community<br />
development. This has occurred in the past and is<br />
currently the best potential source of private<br />
assistance.<br /><br />
B Public support and participation in development<br />
ventures, through traditional as well as innovative<br />
activities, will continue as a basic requirement.<br />
Coordinated planning and programming within and<br />
among public facility systems are requisites to the<br />
staging and financing of growth.<br /><br />
B Opportunities for coventuré between local<br />
governments and representatives of the private sector<br />
should be solicited. Negotiation of individual and<br />
joint responsibilities are critical to all phases of such<br />
undertakings, including the creation of mechanisms<br />
to handle features such as multi-source funding and<br />
cost-sharing arrangements.<br /><br />
B Measures for recovery of capital investments<br />
equitably, without devastation of the market, are<br />
essential. Return to some forms of long term, below<br />
marketing financing, with recovery spread over a<br />
broad revenue base, seems preferable to short term<br />
loading of capital costs solely on new homebuyers.<br /><br />
B Careful use of innovative capital financing<br />
techniques, such as sale-leaseback, can relieve public<br />
financial problems in some cases, releasing<br />
traditional governmental powers to assume fiscal<br />
obligations elsewhere.<br /><br />
Baltimore City occupies a unique position in the<br />
metropolitan area and its problems are those normally<br />
associated with renewal and revitalization. Great strides have<br />
been made in meeting many of these needs using combinations<br />
of federal, state, local, and private funds as well as varied<br />
institutional arrangements. These efforts are exemplified by<br />
Charles Center, the Inner Harbor and Harborplace, and the<br />
Convention Center. A great deal remains to be done throughout<br />
the city and particularly with the vast system of sewer and water<br />
lines, roads, and bridges. As an example of the magnitude of this<br />
problem, some $600 million will be required for wastewater<br />
system maintenance and replacement alone without considering<br />
any other portions of the infrastructure. The city intends to use a<br />
number of ”creative capital funding” measures to meet these<br />
needs including ”sale-leaseback” in which the city will sell a<br />
particular facility to a private investor then lease it back. The<br />
investor is able to benefit from tax write-offs, credits, and<br />
depreciation allowances. No matter how creative, however, most<br />
programs will still be dependent upon state and federal<br />
assistance as well as the traditional fiscal operations.<br /><br />
Another section of the land use analysis “Coordination of<br />
Sewerage and Transportation Investments for Regional<br />
Development” investigates the degree to which major public<br />
investments in sewerage and transportation facilities serve to<br />
support and enhance regional and local development policies.<br />
This work is intended to identify those planned growth areas in<br />
the region which will need new or enlarged facilities in order to<br />
meet local development goals.<br /><br />
The analysis used Regional Planning Districts (RPD) as<br />
the means of identifying growth areas, although in many cases<br />
only a portion of those rather large areas would contain planned<br />
urban growth. A total of 38 RPDs (out of a total of 94 RPDs in<br />
the region) were selected for analysis. Together they account for<br />
89.7% and 76.1% of the projected 1980-1990 population and<br /><br />
employment growth respectively. Existing development<br />
activity, 1978-1980, was then examined using Baltimore Gas and<br />
Electric Company connection data and Regional Planning<br />
Council employment data. The final step was to analyze the<br />
adequacy of both the sewer and transportation systems to<br />
support the demands of the projected growth.<br /><br />
This analysis was done on a very general level and<br />
included planned and programmed facilities and their<br />
approximate times of completion, in order to arrive at general<br />
levels of adequacy to meet growth needs. It must be remembered<br />
that this provides only a guide to facility needs and will be most<br />
useful in future studies to determine project priorities.<br /><br />
Findings of this study indicate that only five of the thirty-<br />
eight RPDs selected for analysis have severe sewerage and/or<br />
transportation system deficiencies. These areas are not evenly<br />
spread throughout the region but are concentrated in Anne<br />
Arundel and Carroll counties, and while they account for only<br />
15.5% of the region’s projected population growth they are<br />
planned to contain 32% of Anne Arundel County and 46% of<br />
Carroll County’s growth.<br /><br />
The bulk of the RPDs examined (26) show problems from<br />
either sewerage system or transportation facility inadequacy and<br />
are fairly evenly distributed throughout the region. Due to the<br />
fact that these areas account for 60.6% and 76% of the region’s<br />
projected population and employment growth respectively, it is<br />
important to carefully program the facilities necessary to correct<br />
system deficiencies.<br /><br />
Results of this study indicate that there are a number of<br />
critical facility problems which must be addressed if the region<br />
and its local governments are to realize their development<br />
objectives. Additionally, it will not be possible to eliminate all of<br />
these deficiencies in the next few years due to funding and other<br />
constraints. While this analysis, which is only a first look at<br />
these problems on a regional level, is by no means definitive it<br />
should prove to be a valuable tool in assisting the state, regional,<br />
and local governments in better defining their facility<br />
construction priorities in the future.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Since the preparation of the 1977 General Development<br />
Plan, there have been some very significant changes in<br />
conditions underlying Baltimore’s future economic prospects.<br />
Some have been positive:<br /><br />
B The transformation of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor<br />
from an wurban eyesore to an internationally<br />
recognized revitalization site.<br /><br />
®  The opening of the Convention Center, Harborplace,<br />
and the National Aquarium generated new<br />
employment and further diversified the local<br />
economy.<br /><br />
B Major construction projects, such as the Baltimore<br />
Metro and Ft. McHenry Tunnel, will enhance the<br />
movement of people and goods throughout the<br />
region.<br /><br />
B Worldwide energy demand has enhanced Baltimore’s<br /><br />
position as one of the leading United States coal ports<br />
with a multi-million dollar infusion of capital into<br />
the Port.<br /><br />
Some have been negative:<br /><br />
m The long term trend away from the production of<br />
goods is accelerating with continued dislocation of<br />
workers from economic sectors long basic to this<br />
area’s economy.<br /><br />
B Government service employment, which once served<br />
to cushion declines in industry, has been declining<br />
since the late 1970s.<br /><br />
B The consequences of new economic policies in<br />
Washington, featuring tight monetary policy and<br />
shifting of responsibility from federal to state local<br />
governments are still uncertain.<br /><br />
® Unemployment has continued to increase<br />
particularly among blacks.<br /><br />
As a result of these and other changes, the 1982 General<br /><br />
Development Plan has focussed on a few important issues which<br />
can be effectively addressed by state and local decision makers.<br /><br />
Issue: Capturing a Share of Growth Industries<br /><br />
As an indication of the changes which have been<br />
occurring in the Baltimore economy, the following table shows<br />
the changes in employment, as percentages of total regional<br />
employment, in the major economic sectors which have<br />
occurred since 1960 and projected to the year 2000.<br /><br />

SOURCE: Regional Planning Council estimates and projections.<br /><br />
The table clearly shows the continuing decline of<br />
employment in the Manufacturing sector and the rather<br />
dramatic increase in the Service sector. An important point to<br />
bear in mind is that there are a number of bright spots in the<br />
Manufacturing sector such as electronics and<br />
telecommunications which are among the so-called “high tech”<br />
industries. It is recommended that every effort be made to attract<br />
these growth industries to the region by emphasizing the<br />
advantages of the Baltimore area in terms of its existing<br />
institutions such as The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics<br />
Laboratory, the Space Telescope Institute now under<br />
development, the major medical institutions, and the proximity<br />
of other federal research institutions.<br /><br />
While the wholesale/retail activities, represented by the<br />
Trade sector are a fairly stable component of the regional<br />
economy, its status can be improved by increasing activity in the<br />
Port of Baltimore and additional gains associated with the<br />
tourism/convention activity centered in the Inner Harbor.<br /><br />
It is.in the Service sector of the economy where major<br />
investments in Baltimore MetroCenter may make it more<br />","G3&vY<br />

<br />
When the Regional Planning Council was established in 1963 by the State Legislature, it was charged with<br />
preparing a General Development Plan for the Baltimore Region. The purpose of this plan is best stated by the Act<br />
which established the Council: ”An opportunity must be provided for the several units of government within the area<br />
to work together with the State and private agencies toward the solution of their problems. In order to deal with these<br />
matters on a rational and sound basis, they must be considered within the framework of a general development plan<br />
for the area.” (Article 78D, Section 1.) Additionally, the Act establishes the general contents of the plan, as follows:<br />
”The plan shall be based upon comprehensive surveys and studies of land use, transportation, public utilities,<br />
governmental facilities and services, and natural resources. It shall take into account social and economic factors,<br />
conditions, and trends that are relevant to the probable future development of the area.” (Article 78D, Section 12, (a).)<br />
<br />
All three prior General Development Plans have followed this general outline while varying in thrust and de-<br />
tail to meet the major issues of regional importance at the time of their preparation. The 1982 General Development<br />
Plan is no exception and addresses the problems of implementing necessary programs in a time of reduced fiscal<br />
resources, declining growth and a sluggish economy. The how and what to implement is the single most important<br />
issue facing the state, region, and local governments at this time. Establishment of priorities, both in terms of<br />
programs and facilities, is critical and must be matched by the means to secure the funds to pay for them. High<br />
interest rates are making it more difficult for the state and local governments to raise funds for capital projects and<br />
have also affected business expansion and formation with depressing effects on tax revenues. Additionally,<br />
decreasing federal financial assistance is placing increased burdens on state and local resources.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, while revenue sources are decreasing or becoming more expensive to obtain, demands for<br />
government expenditures are as high, or higher, than ever. In the era of rapid suburban growth following the Second<br />
World War, enormous expenditures for new public facilities of all kinds were required to keep pace with needs, while<br />
funds for maintenance of existing facilities were reduced. The facilities built during the fifties and sixties are in need<br />
of repair and, in some cases, enlargement, while the other facilities on which maintenance had been deferred are in<br />
great need of repair and, in many cases, replacement. Additionally, many older communities need revitalization and<br />
new facilities.<br />
<br />
In addressing these and other problems, many of which are not related to the physical facilities of the region but<br />
to the social and economic needs of the residents, the Regional Planning Council has concentrated on seven major<br />
areas of concern, i.e., Transportation, Economic Development, Housing, Land Use, Energy, Environment, and<br />
Human Services. Each area of concern defines the most critical problems, examines program and project priorities,<br />
and suggests a number of ways by which the necessary funding can be obtained. Following this analysis, a series of<br />
goals are established with accompanying policies and strategies to achieve these goals. In many respects, the point of<br />
view of this GDP is shorter than the usual 20 year range of previous plans as it is more involved with the short range (5<br />
-10 years) view associated with plan and program implementation. However, many of the goals are long range in<br />
nature and will require a considerable length of time before they can be achieved. On May 27, 1982, Governor Hughes<br />
issued an Executive Order containing 72 major policies which will be used by state agencies as they make decisions<br />
affecting development in Maryland. The goals and policies of the General Development Plan are consistent with and<br />
serve to reaffirm and support the policies of the Executive Order.<br />
<br />
In the following discussion, each of the areas of concern will be summarized with particular reference to the<br />
issues and goals. These summaries are necessarily very brief and contain only the most critical issues, goals, and<br />
findings. The reader interested in the policies and strategies developed to reach the recommended goals is referred to<br />
the pertinent volumes which accompany this summary or to the volume of goals and policies which contains all of<br />
<br />
the policies and strategies recommended by the Regional Planning Council.<br />

Baltimore City occupies a unique position in the<br />
metropolitan area and its problems are those normally<br />
associated with renewal and revitalization. Great strides have<br />
been made in meeting many of these needs using combinations<br />
of federal, state, local, and private funds as well as varied<br />
institutional arrangements. These efforts are exemplified by<br />
Charles Center, the Inner Harbor and Harborplace, and the<br />
Convention Center. A great deal remains to be done throughout<br />
the city and particularly with the vast system of sewer and water<br />
lines, roads, and bridges. As an example of the magnitude of this<br />
problem, some $600 million will be required for wastewater<br />
system maintenance and replacement alone without considering<br />
any other portions of the infrastructure. The city intends to use a<br />
number of ”creative capital funding” measures to meet these<br />
needs including ”sale-leaseback” in which the city will sell a<br />
particular facility to a private investor then lease it back. The<br />
investor is able to benefit from tax write-offs, credits, and<br />
depreciation allowances. No matter how creative, however, most<br />
programs will still be dependent upon state and federal<br />
assistance as well as the traditional fiscal operations.<br />
<br />
Another section of the land use analysis “Coordination of<br />
Sewerage and Transportation Investments for Regional<br />
Development” investigates the degree to which major public<br />
investments in sewerage and transportation facilities serve to<br />
support and enhance regional and local development policies.<br />
This work is intended to identify those planned growth areas in<br />
the region which will need new or enlarged facilities in order to<br />
meet local development goals.<br />
<br />
The analysis used Regional Planning Districts (RPD) as<br />
the means of identifying growth areas, although in many cases<br />
only a portion of those rather large areas would contain planned<br />
urban growth. A total of 38 RPDs (out of a total of 94 RPDs in<br />
the region) were selected for analysis. Together they account for<br />
89.7% and 76.1% of the projected 1980-1990 population and<br />
<br />
employment growth respectively. Existing development<br />
activity, 1978-1980, was then examined using Baltimore Gas and<br />
Electric Company connection data and Regional Planning<br />
Council employment data. The final step was to analyze the<br />
adequacy of both the sewer and transportation systems to<br />
support the demands of the projected growth.<br />
<br />
This analysis was done on a very general level and<br />
included planned and programmed facilities and their<br />
approximate times of completion, in order to arrive at general<br />
levels of adequacy to meet growth needs. It must be remembered<br />
that this provides only a guide to facility needs and will be most<br />
useful in future studies to determine project priorities.<br />
<br />
Findings of this study indicate that only five of the thirty-<br />
eight RPDs selected for analysis have severe sewerage and/or<br />
transportation system deficiencies. These areas are not evenly<br />
spread throughout the region but are concentrated in Anne<br />
Arundel and Carroll counties, and while they account for only<br />
15.5% of the region’s projected population growth they are<br />
planned to contain 32% of Anne Arundel County and 46% of<br />
Carroll County’s growth.<br />
<br />
The bulk of the RPDs examined (26) show problems from<br />
either sewerage system or transportation facility inadequacy and<br />
are fairly evenly distributed throughout the region. Due to the<br />
fact that these areas account for 60.6% and 76% of the region’s<br />
projected population and employment growth respectively, it is<br />
important to carefully program the facilities necessary to correct<br />
system deficiencies.<br />
<br />
Results of this study indicate that there are a number of<br />
critical facility problems which must be addressed if the region<br />
and its local governments are to realize their development<br />
objectives. Additionally, it will not be possible to eliminate all of<br />
these deficiencies in the next few years due to funding and other<br />
constraints. While this analysis, which is only a first look at<br />
these problems on a regional level, is by no means definitive it<br />
should prove to be a valuable tool in assisting the state, regional,<br />
and local governments in better defining their facility<br />
construction priorities in the future.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Since the preparation of the 1977 General Development<br />
Plan, there have been some very significant changes in<br />
conditions underlying Baltimore’s future economic prospects.<br />
Some have been positive:<br />
<br />
B The transformation of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor<br />
from an wurban eyesore to an internationally<br />
recognized revitalization site.<br />
<br />
®  The opening of the Convention Center, Harborplace,<br />
and the National Aquarium generated new<br />
employment and further diversified the local<br />
economy.<br />
<br />
B Major construction projects, such as the Baltimore<br />
Metro and Ft. McHenry Tunnel, will enhance the<br />
movement of people and goods throughout the<br />
region.<br />
<br />
B Worldwide energy demand has enhanced Baltimore’s<br />
<br />
position as one of the leading United States coal ports<br />
with a multi-million dollar infusion of capital into<br />
the Port.<br />
<br />
Some have been negative:<br />
<br />
m The long term trend away from the production of<br />
goods is accelerating with continued dislocation of<br />
workers from economic sectors long basic to this<br />
area’s economy.<br />
<br />
B Government service employment, which once served<br />
to cushion declines in industry, has been declining<br />
since the late 1970s.<br />
<br />
B The consequences of new economic policies in<br />
Washington, featuring tight monetary policy and<br />
shifting of responsibility from federal to state local<br />
governments are still uncertain.<br />
<br />
® Unemployment has continued to increase<br />
particularly among blacks.<br />
<br />
As a result of these and other changes, the 1982 General<br />
<br />
Development Plan has focussed on a few important issues which<br />
can be effectively addressed by state and local decision makers.<br />
<br />
Issue: Capturing a Share of Growth Industries<br />
<br />
As an indication of the changes which have been<br />
occurring in the Baltimore economy, the following table shows<br />
the changes in employment, as percentages of total regional<br />
employment, in the major economic sectors which have<br />
occurred since 1960 and projected to the year 2000.<br />
<br />

SOURCE: Regional Planning Council estimates and projections.<br />
<br />
The table clearly shows the continuing decline of<br />
employment in the Manufacturing sector and the rather<br />
dramatic increase in the Service sector. An important point to<br />
bear in mind is that there are a number of bright spots in the<br />
Manufacturing sector such as electronics and<br />
telecommunications which are among the so-called “high tech”<br />
industries. It is recommended that every effort be made to attract<br />
these growth industries to the region by emphasizing the<br />
advantages of the Baltimore area in terms of its existing<br />
institutions such as The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics<br />
Laboratory, the Space Telescope Institute now under<br />
development, the major medical institutions, and the proximity<br />
of other federal research institutions.<br />
<br />
While the wholesale/retail activities, represented by the<br />
Trade sector are a fairly stable component of the regional<br />
economy, its status can be improved by increasing activity in the<br />
Port of Baltimore and additional gains associated with the<br />
tourism/convention activity centered in the Inner Harbor.<br />
<br />
It is.in the Service sector of the economy where major<br />
investments in Baltimore MetroCenter may make it more<br />

A MESSAGE FROM MAYOR WILLIAM DONALD SCHAEFER<br /><br />
Great opportunity awaits you in Market Center downtown. Here<br />
in the heart of Baltimore, we have turned plans into successful results<br />
which will generate a good return on your future investments. The<br />
Charles Center complex and our Inner Harbor are internationally<br />
acclaimed proof that the Baltimore development process works.<br /><br />
Our newest venture, Market Center, is a continuation of our other<br />
important development successes. Handsome buildings, many quali-<br />
fying for tax credits, are available for retail, residential, and commer-<br />
cial rehabilitation. Prime sites for new single use and mixed-use<br />
development are available throughout the District. Currently, close<br />
to $250 million in public/private construction is underway or com-<br />
pleted with much more coming on stream this year.<br /><br />
We have worked very hard in Baltimore to make it easy for business<br />
people to achieve their development goals. The City has poured<br />
millions of dollars into needed public improvements and necessary<br />
public financing for projects. A vital ingredient in the Market Center<br />
development mix has been the active participation of a Project Area<br /><br />
Committee whose 800 members have critiqued and endorsed the<br />
planning process. Among the more unique approaches are a promo-<br />
tion fee used to advertise retail and special events and an upgrading<br />
of 650 area facades, perhaps the most ambitious such undertaking<br />
in the nation.<br /><br />
Market Center’s success is the result of a combination of impor-<br />
tant elements: a positive partnership between all levels of government,<br />
a vibrant private sector involvement, and the support and good will<br />
of the Market Center business people, the media, and principally,<br />
the citizens of Baltimore. It is a stunning example of a progressive<br />
vision in urban development producing opportunities and results!<br /><br />
I cordially urge you to visit us and discover these unique oppor-<br />
tunities for your future growth.<br /><br />

THE CROSSROADS OF BALTIMORE<br /><br />
The Crossroads at Howard and Lexington Streets has long<br />
been the heart of Baltimore. Within two blocks of this vital<br />
location, over 2,000 new employees now work in more than<br />
600,000 square feet of new and rehabilitated office/retail<br />
space.<br /><br />
The Crossroads is the center of downtown transportation<br />
modes. The new Howard Street Transit Mall intersects with<br />
Lexington Mall, the busiest pedestrian corridor downtown.<br />
This tree-lined, brick promenade links the Charles Center<br />
office cluster with the world-famous Lexington Market.<br />
Along the way are three department stores and scores of<br />
specialty shops.<br /><br />
As the name implies, The Crossroads is the focus of<br />
downtown activity. Within a few minutes’ walk are various<br /><br />
office, residential and recreational options, as well as approx-<br />
imately one million square feet of retail space. Many of<br />
Baltimore’s world-class cultural and educational institutions<br />
are no more than a 10 to 15 minute walk away. Many of<br />
Baltimore’s famous restaurants and hotels are within an easy<br /><br />
walk of The Crossroads.<br /><br />
The major station stop on the Baltimore Metro, less than<br />
a block away, runs ahead of ridership projections. Some<br />
three-fourths of all Metro buses stop on or just off Howard<br />
Street. Over 4,000 off-street spaces are within a two-minute<br />
walk. Super highway access is just down the street, providing<br />
an easy drive time to Washington, DC.<br /><br /><br /><br />

MARKET CENTER IN DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE D,<br /><br />
The transformation of Baltimore from dowdy, old<br />
port city to international urban magnet is an<br />
unparalleled development success story. While the<br />
development of Charles Center and the Inner<br />
Harbor is justly acclaimed, Baltimore continues to<br />
offer sound development opportunities downtown.<br />
Market Center is where the action is and will be.<br /><br />
Market Center is where downtown started in<br />
Baltimore. This traditional retail core of one million<br />
square feet is surrounded by vital clusters of business,<br />
medical, cultural, educational and residential uses.<br /><br />
These include a favorite Baltimore attraction, the<br />
204 year old Lexington Market; the University of<br />
Maryland Graduate Professional Schools, the<br /><br />

specialty shops and galleries on Charles Street, the<br />
State of Maryland office complex, the Mt. Royal<br />
cultural district, and new residential neighborhoods<br />
in Seton Hill and the Loft District.<br /><br />
Market Center offers distinct advantages for<br />
developers and investors. First, there is the Baltimore<br />
talent for creative public/private financing. Second,<br />
developers can depend on a predictable municipal<br />
process. Third, within the 225-acre Market Center<br />
area are handsome buildings which will generate<br />
rehabilitation tax benefits. New construction poten-<br /><br />

Many feel the priceless advantage of doing business<br />
in Market Center is the powerful role played by<br />
results-oriented leadership. There are four elements:<br />
a strong and committed Mayor, an enthusiastic<br />
volunteer business community and citizenry endors-<br />

MARKET CENTER IN DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE D,<br />
<br />
The transformation of Baltimore from dowdy, old<br />
port city to international urban magnet is an<br />
unparalleled development success story. While the<br />
development of Charles Center and the Inner<br />
Harbor is justly acclaimed, Baltimore continues to<br />
offer sound development opportunities downtown.<br />
Market Center is where the action is and will be.<br />
<br />
Market Center is where downtown started in<br />
Baltimore. This traditional retail core of one million<br />
square feet is surrounded by vital clusters of business,<br />
medical, cultural, educational and residential uses.<br />
<br />
These include a favorite Baltimore attraction, the<br />
204 year old Lexington Market; the University of<br />
Maryland Graduate Professional Schools, the<br />

<br />
internationally acclaimed Shock Trauma Center,<br />
University Hospital, Social Security Administration<br />
Complex, the Charles Center office cluster, the<br />
specialty shops and galleries on Charles Street, the<br />
State of Maryland office complex, the Mt. Royal<br />
cultural district, and new residential neighborhoods<br />
in Seton Hill and the Loft District.<br />
<br />
Market Center offers distinct advantages for<br />
developers and investors. First, there is the Baltimore<br />
talent for creative public/private financing. Second,<br />
developers can depend on a predictable municipal<br />
process. Third, within the 225-acre Market Center<br />
area are handsome buildings which will generate<br />
rehabilitation tax benefits. New construction poten-<br />

<br />
Many feel the priceless advantage of doing business<br />
in Market Center is the powerful role played by<br />
results-oriented leadership. There are four elements:<br />
a strong and committed Mayor, an enthusiastic<br />
volunteer business community and citizenry endors-<br />
ing development action through the Market Center<br />
Project Area Committee; the unique, non-profit,<br />
quasi-public Market Center Development Corpora-<br />
tion of Baltimore, and the full cooperation of<br />
municipal agencies and boards.<br />

THE COUNTRY AROUND WASHIN GTON<br /><br />
R<br /><br />
B When, in George Waslnngton 8 tame, the site of the Caplfal<br /><br />
tion on the Potomac, midway between the North and the South,<br /><br />
the word tidewater was a good one to conjure with, and naviga-<br />
~ tion meant the largest means of commerce, for waterways then<br /><br />
- afforded the easiest mode of travel and transportation. Other<br /><br />
5 »1., modes there were, of course; wagons rumbled over rough roads,<br />
- and stage coaches jostled ﬁ'orm town to town their loads of<br /><br />
uneasy passengers, who had no thought of better or quicker<br />
- Means of travel.<br />
~would have dreamed of radiate in all directions fromi the<br />
Nation’s Capital, inviting new-fashioned power-dnven vehicles<br />
~ to swift and casy riding; and steel rails that lead nortl, south,<br />
. east, and west bear well-loaded trains which move at a speed<br />
that the foundersof the Nation would have considered perilous<br />
or incredible.: Even the air has now become a thoroughfare,<br />
~and aircraft may daﬂy be seen flying afar from an dviation field<br />
- at Wasliington. :<br />
Tidewater nawgatmn may have lost some of its appeal in our<br /><br />
day, yet from time to time light-draft war vessels of the United<br /><br />
States and of other nations ecome from' all the world’s seas to<br />
anchor by the United States Navy Yard at Washington. The<br />
Potomac is still the same noble river that was ferried by George<br />
Washington—far more majestic than the Thames, the Seine, or<br />
the Tiber, on which stand great capitals of the Old World—<br />
and its glamour is now glogiously enriched by sacréd memories.<br />
The Arlington Mangion, which was built on a site familiar to<br />
George Washington and which before the Civil War was the<br />
home of a great Southerner, stands to-day among thirty thou-<br /><br />
sand graves as a shrine of national devotion and a pledge of<br /><br />
national unity: From the portals of the mansion the visitor<br /><br />
may see the river gleaming. just below, and beyond it liesa<br />
scene that Lafayette, when a guest there, pronounced the<br />
finest in the world, now made still finer by a beautified city<br />
thwt has become a place of pilgrimage for all Americans.<br /><br />
“A few miles downstream from Arlington stands historic<br />
Alexandria, where Washington worshiped, a eity much older<br />
thau the Capital, lying midway between it and Mount Vernon,<br /><br />
x the home of Washington, another American Mecca.<br /><br />
* Annapolis, the capital of Maryland, thirty miles east of Wash -<br />
_mv\ton, stands at tidewater on the Severn, close to Chesapeake<br />
Bay, the largest and perhaps the most attractive body of water<br />
of its kind along the Atlantic coast. Annapolis is proud of a<br />
history that extends far back into Colonial times. There once<br />
sat the Continental Congress, and there George Washington<br />
resigned his commission as Commander in Chief. Future<br />
officers of our warships receive training at Annapolis, at the<br />
United States Naval Academy.<br /><br />
The country around Washington shown on the other side of<br />
this sheet is full of historic memories. Bladensburg, a few<br />
miles northeast of the city, remembered for its old dueling<br />
ground, recalls to mind the death there of Commodore Decatur,<br />
“the hero of Tripoli.” There also was made a feeble defense of<br />
the city against British-invaders who burned both the Capitol<br />
and the White House in our second war with England. We<br />
.remembeér, too, that later in that same war an American held<br />
for a time as a prisoner on a British vessel in the harbor of<br />
Baltimore gave us in an hour of stress “The Star-Spangled<br />
Banner.”<br /><br />
~ The Civil War also left here its marks and its memories.<br />
‘Through the streets of Frederick, forty miles northwest of<br />
Washington, on that *‘cool September morn” sung by Whittier,<br />
“Stonewall” Jackson’s men marched, menacingly, too near the<br />
Capital. Later a small force under -the eommand of Jubal<br />
Early achieved the nearest approach ‘to the city made by the<br />
“soldiers of the Southern Confederacy, in a battle whose site is<br />
marked by gravestones to be seen only a few miles north of<br />
Washington. The curious traveler may stand to-day, if he<br />
will.just where Lincoln stood under fire in ’64 on the ram-<br />
parts of an earthen fort to survey the scene of that buttle.<br />
Remnants of similar forts that then made a chain around the<br />
city may still be found here and there in the suburbs. Sites<br />
of battle fields dot the country southwest of Washington, across<br />
the Potomac. There on the map we may see the suggestive<br />
names Bull Run, Manassas, and Chantilly.<br /><br />
Sinee the days of the Civil War Washington has grown in<br />
population fromeless than 100,000 to nearly 450,000 and<br />
Baltimore from about 250,000 to more than 770,000, each<br />
'spreadmg far beyond its war-time limits, and scores of villages<br />
have sprung up in the countrysrde between and around the<br />
two cities.<br /><br />
This region recalls also some events of history of quite<br />
another kmd One of the earliest railroads operated in the<br /><br />
- United States was _that between Washington and Baltimore,<br /><br />
and the first telegraph line in the world carried words between<br />
those cities. Samuel Pierpont Langley, Secretary of the<br /><br />

national lixetory ~Great men -and great events are here fitly<br /><br />
commemorated in a national spmt and the visitor from any<br /><br />
State may justly feel, as he views its impiessive memorials and<br /><br />
its abounding beauty, that his Capital City may be proudly? :<br />
_compared wrth any other of the world’s capitals. . s<br /><br />
Amid all the stirring and s&amp;gmﬁmnt events of human lnsto,<br /><br /><br /><br />
- that are linked with this region the subtle yet effective work of i _ Chesapeake Bay is a fine example of what is called a “drowned. .<br /><br />
‘natural forces on the face of the earth has here been carried<br />
along unceasingly.  The natural features of the region shotm<br />
on the map are those which are peculiar to the country that lies<br /><br />
along what is called the “fall line”—the line or zone in which<br /><br />
the streams of the southern Atlantic slope fall in cataracts - .<br /><br />
or rapids. from the Piedmont Plateau to the Coastal Plain.<br />
Washington, Baltimore, and other cities farther north or south<br /><br />
stand in this zone, which marks the head of navigation and .<br /><br />
so determined their location. In the area northwest of this<br />
zone the streams flow swiftly or turbulently in rather narrow<br />
channels; in the area southeast of it, at least in this region, they<br />
become broad tidal estuaries. The Potomac makes its largest<br />
leap at Grreat Falls, about 16 miles above Washington, and it<br />
foams in a smaller cascade at Little Falls, about 5 miles above<br />
the city. Those who may journey to Great Falls will find<br />
there, on the Virginia side, a half-ruined stretch of a part of<br />
a canal built under the direction of George Washington as a<br />
link in a projected chain of waterways designed to connect the<br /><br />
“East and the West of his day. This canal was replaced by<br /><br />
the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, on the Maryland side of the<br /><br />
river, which extends from Washingfon to Cumberland. The<br />
- seene at the falls is impressively wild and rugged. Here the<br /><br />
river has long been wearing its way into hard rocks—gnelss<br />
and schist—and in a deep gorge thus made below the falls its<br />
waters surge swiftly forward in their course to the sea.<br /><br />
At Washington the Potomac is joined by the Anacostia— -<br /><br />
the “Eastern Branch” — on which, it is said, boats once<br />
ascended on tidewater to Bladensburg. In the Piedmont<br />
country we can see how stream beds are cut; here, on the<br />
Coastal Plain, ‘'we can see how, by similar slow yet ceaseless<br /><br />
-natural processes, stream beds are filled up; and we have<br />
learned, too, that the crust of the earth, seemlngly so stable, -<br /><br />
is really always in' quivering motion and that regions are raised<br /><br />
or lowered by subterranean forces which . from age to Hge -<br /><br />
transform land to sea and sea to land.<br /><br />
It is by just such erosion and deposition and by such ups<br />
and downs that geologic formations are made: Areas that<br />
are uplifted or that stand high are gradually worn down<br />
by rain and rill and slide and stream, rocks are broken up<br />
by frost and chemical action into fragments; and the waste<br />
thus formed is carried down and deposited elegwhere at one<br /><br />
‘or another period of time as gravel and sand and mud in<br /><br />
great patches or in widely extended deposits to make forma-<br />
tions. A formation is thus merely a deposit or a series of<br /><br />
deposits laid down, generally in water, at a certain time and<br /><br />
place; the stuff of which it is made is @s old as the earth.<br />
‘The record of the time in which it was formed—its geologic<br />
age—can be learned best from the remnants of once living<br />
beings that made it their graveyard for every age bas its<br />
characteristic fossils. :<br /><br />
The rocks that lie northwest of the fall line are in general<br />
old and hard—rocks like granite—and evidently once lay far<br />
beneath the surface; those that lie southeast of that line are in<br />
general younger and softer, including sand and clay. The<br />
gource .of the softer deposits was, of course, the harder, older<br />
rocks, and the way in which these rocks are broken down<br />
into fragments may be seen in any natural or artificial cut that<br />
exposes them to weatherir g, such as a streamway or a road cut.<br /><br />
Where the granitic rocks are thus disintegrated the minerals of -<br /><br />
which they are composed-—quartz, mica, and feldspar, for ex-<br /><br />
ample—become loose sand and clay and, being then subject to -<br /><br />
movement by running water, are gradually carried downstream<br />
toward the sea—in this region southeastward. The oldest of<br /><br />
these southeasterly deposits were laid down in ""Cretaceous-<br /><br />
time, in what has been called the age of reptiles—not snakes,<br />
for snakes were rare in that age—but lizard-like and other<br />
forms, some of them huge and unwieldy, much larger than<br /><br />
alligators, others smaller, and still others having wings and -<br />
Birds with teeth were among the strange<br /><br />
the power of flight. .<br />
beings of that age. The plants of Cretaceous time, which are<br />
recorded mainly by innumerable impressions of leaves, included<br />
the precursors of our present trees and shrubs. :<br /><br />
Upon submerged Cretaceous deposits later formations were<br />
laid down by the combined action of erosion and deposition—<br />
forces still here in operation.<br /><br />
Voleanic rocks are found in the northwest quarter of the ’<br /><br />
region shown on the map, where, ages ago, lavas were poured<br /><br />
out of vents that have not yet been discovered.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

found in the area here mapped more than 300 grow only in the<br />
Piedmont region and nearly 80 others do not grow far east of<br />
it. On the other hand, nearly 200 species of these 1,600 grow<br />
only on the Coastal Plain and nearly 90 others do not grow -<br />

The largest tree in the region is the oak, many specles of<br /><br />
areas by the tulip tree (Liriodendron), often. called the tuhp<br />
poplar, whose soft wood is marketed as poplhr and is used in<br />
making paper. The chestnut was once abundant here, but its<br />
very existence is now threatened by a widespread blight whose<br />
ravages have not yet been stopped by the most devoted scien-<br />
tific study and effort. The beech, more beautiful, perhaps, than<br />
any other, adorns the woodland here and there, its smooth,<br />
well-rounded trunk tempting defacement by the carved initials<br />
of loiterers and lovers.<br /><br />
The native flora is well preserved in Rock Creek National<br />

At Washington the Potomac is joined by the Anacostia— -<br />
<br />
the “Eastern Branch” — on which, it is said, boats once<br />
ascended on tidewater to Bladensburg. In the Piedmont<br />
country we can see how stream beds are cut; here, on the<br />
Coastal Plain, ‘'we can see how, by similar slow yet ceaseless<br />
<br />
-natural processes, stream beds are filled up; and we have<br />
learned, too, that the crust of the earth, seemlngly so stable, -<br />
<br />
is really always in' quivering motion and that regions are raised<br />
<br />
or lowered by subterranean forces which . from age to Hge -<br />
<br />
transform land to sea and sea to land.<br />
<br />
It is by just such erosion and deposition and by such ups<br />
and downs that geologic formations are made: Areas that<br />
are uplifted or that stand high are gradually worn down<br />
by rain and rill and slide and stream, rocks are broken up<br />
by frost and chemical action into fragments; and the waste<br />
thus formed is carried down and deposited elegwhere at one<br />
<br />
‘or another period of time as gravel and sand and mud in<br />
<br />
great patches or in widely extended deposits to make forma-<br />
tions. A formation is thus merely a deposit or a series of<br />
<br />
deposits laid down, generally in water, at a certain time and<br />
<br />
place; the stuff of which it is made is @s old as the earth.<br />
‘The record of the time in which it was formed—its geologic<br />
age—can be learned best from the remnants of once living<br />
beings that made it their graveyard for every age bas its<br />
characteristic fossils. :<br />
<br />
The rocks that lie northwest of the fall line are in general<br />
old and hard—rocks like granite—and evidently once lay far<br />
beneath the surface; those that lie southeast of that line are in<br />
general younger and softer, including sand and clay. The<br />
gource .of the softer deposits was, of course, the harder, older<br />
rocks, and the way in which these rocks are broken down<br />
into fragments may be seen in any natural or artificial cut that<br />
exposes them to weatherir g, such as a streamway or a road cut.<br />
<br />
Where the granitic rocks are thus disintegrated the minerals of -<br />
<br />
which they are composed-—quartz, mica, and feldspar, for ex-<br />
<br />
ample—become loose sand and clay and, being then subject to -<br />
<br />
movement by running water, are gradually carried downstream<br />
toward the sea—in this region southeastward. The oldest of<br />
<br />
these southeasterly deposits were laid down in ""Cretaceous-<br />
<br />
time, in what has been called the age of reptiles—not snakes,<br />
for snakes were rare in that age—but lizard-like and other<br />
forms, some of them huge and unwieldy, much larger than<br />
<br />
alligators, others smaller, and still others having wings and -<br />
Birds with teeth were among the strange<br />
<br />
the power of flight. .<br />
beings of that age. The plants of Cretaceous time, which are<br />
recorded mainly by innumerable impressions of leaves, included<br />
the precursors of our present trees and shrubs. :<br />
<br />
Upon submerged Cretaceous deposits later formations were<br />
laid down by the combined action of erosion and deposition—<br />
forces still here in operation.<br />
<br />
Voleanic rocks are found in the northwest quarter of the ’<br />
<br />
region shown on the map, where, ages ago, lavas were poured<br />
<br />
out of vents that have not yet been discovered.<br />

found in the area here mapped more than 300 grow only in the<br />
Piedmont region and nearly 80 others do not grow far east of<br />
it. On the other hand, nearly 200 species of these 1,600 grow<br />
only on the Coastal Plain and nearly 90 others do not grow -<br />

The largest tree in the region is the oak, many specles of<br />

poplar, whose soft wood is marketed as poplhr and is used in<br />
making paper. The chestnut was once abundant here, but its<br />
very existence is now threatened by a widespread blight whose<br />
ravages have not yet been stopped by the most devoted scien-<br />
tific study and effort. The beech, more beautiful, perhaps, than<br />
any other, adorns the woodland here and there, its smooth,<br />
well-rounded trunk tempting defacement by the carved initials<br />
of loiterers and lovers.<br />

bridge and ferry routes through sections replete in historic<br /><br />
and picturesque beauty.<br /><br />
Listed below are a few of the numerous places of interest that may be<br /><br />
visited enroute:<br /><br />
1—Havre de Grace, Maryland.—Originally called Susque-<br />
hanna Lower Ferry. General Washington stopped here<br />
many times: also site of the Susquehanna River Bridge,<br />
adjudged the most beautiful large bridge built in the<br />
. United States during 1940.<br />
2—""Tudor Hall”. Birthplace of Edwin Booth and John Wilkes<br />
Booth.<br />
3—Birthplace of William Paca, signer of the Declaration of<br />
Independence. R s 7<br />
4—Baltimore, Maryland. Birthplace of the “Star Spangled<br />
Banner” and seventh largest city in the United States,<br />
third largest seoport in total waler borne commerce, wast<br />
industrial center, manufacturing a wide variety of<br />
products.<br />
5—Annapolis, capital of Maryland. Untouched by restora-<br />
tion Annapolis has been adjudged the finest example of<br />
a colonial city in America. Particularly interesting to<br />
visitors are: the United States Naval Academy (1845),<br />
Chase House, Hammond Harwood House, St. John’s Col-<br />
lege (1696), St. Anne’s Church (1699) are but a few of<br />
them.,<br />
6—Site of home and grave of Dr. Beanes whose arrest by<br />
the British in 1814 was the cause of.Francis Scott Key<br />
writing the “Star Spangled Banner”. :<br />
7—""Mount Airy”. The home of Benedict Calvert whose<br />
daughter married Washington’'s stepson. ;<br />
8—""De La Brooke Manor”. Surveyed in 1650 for Robert<br />
Brooke, Commander of Charles County.<br />
9—The birthplace of Roger Brooke Taney., Chief Justice of<br />
the United States, 1836-64.<br />
10—""The Cliffs of Calvert”. One of the most picturesque spots<br />
in Maryland.<br />
11—""Dr. Mudd’'s House”. Home of Dr. Mudd, who set the<br />
broken leg of John Wilkes Booth.<br />
12—""La Grange”, the home of Dr. James Craik, Washington’s<br />
lifelong friend and physician.<br />
13—""Samuel Cox's Fdarm""”, where John Wilkes Booth and his<br />
accomplice hid for several days.<br />
14—""Laidlow’s Ferry”. Washington crossed here many times<br />
on his way to Williamsburg. Practically the present site<br />
of the Potomac River Bridge.<br />
15—Wakefield, Virginia. Birthplace of George Washington.<br />
Now a National Monument, the estate is under the super-<br />
vision of the National Parks.<br />
16—Saint Mary's City, Maryland. Siter of Maryland's pro-<br />
vincial government for more than sixty years, after which<br />
the capitol was moved to Annapolis in 1695. There now<br />
stands on the original site a replica of the original<br />
State House, made from brick brought over from England.<br />
17—Richmond, Virginia. A typical city of the South and its<br />
traditions. The capitol of Virginia and its largest city,<br />

NORTH - SOUTH ROUTES<br />
by<br />
BRIDGES AND FERRY<br />
<br />
Two North-South routes illustrated by the<br />
map in this folder may be followed, both<br />
of modern construction and both famed<br />
for their safety and of average possible<br />
speed.<br />
<br />
BA—The North-South route over the Sus-<br />
quehanna River Bridge and Potomac<br />
River Bridge following U. S. 1 from New<br />
York to Philadelphia thence U. S. 13 which<br />
leads into U. S. 40 over the Susquehanna<br />
River Bridge, continue on U. S. 40 to<br />
Baltimore, pick up and follow MD. 2 to<br />
Glen Burnie, here turn right to U. S. 301<br />
leading direct to the Potomac River Bridge.<br />
<br />
B—From New Brunswick follow U. S. 130<br />
(after crossing the Delaware River) pick<br />
up U. S. 13 that leads into the Del-Mar-Va<br />
Peninsula. Continue on U. S. 13 to Smyrna,<br />
Delaware, turn right here into DEL. 300,<br />
continue on DEL. and MD. 300 to Church<br />
Hill, then U. S. 213 to Centerville, MD. 18<br />
to Queenstown and MD. 404 to the Mata-<br />
peake-Annapolis Ferry. From Annapolis<br />
follow U. S. 50 to Priest Bridge, or MD. 2<br />
to MD. 214, both routes lead to Upper<br />
Marlboro, here take U. S. 301 direct to<br />
the Potomac River Bridge. After crossing<br />
the Potomac River Bridge one may fol-<br />
low U. S. 301* to Port Royal thence U. S.<br />
17 to Yorkiown, Williamsburg, Jamestown<br />
and the South or follow through on U. S.<br />
301 to Bowling Green, Richmond, Peters-<br />
burg and Southern points.<br />
<br />
*Three miles south of Potomac River Bridge<br />
U. S. 301 temporarily under construction<br />
(July, 1941). Avoid this by using VA. 206<br />
to VA. 3 then turn left to intersection of<br />

It is estimated that in the next 20 years,<br />
100,000 additional acres, or about 7<br />
percent of the region, will be required<br /><br />
for new development.<br /><br />
Residential land area requirements to<br />
meet projected growth are in the vicinity<br />
of an additional 64,000 acres of land,<br /><br />
of which 49,000 acres will be in single-<br />
family development and 15,000 acres in<br />
multi-family development. Over 85 per-<br />
cent of new residential land will be<br />
developed in Anne Arundel, Baltimore<br />
and Howard Counties.<br /><br />
There are now about 13,000 acres used<br />
as commercial land, and about 9,000<br />
additional acres will be needed by 19290<br /><br />
Of prime consideration in proposing<br /><br />
tives: integration of development with<br />
natural physiographic characteristics;<br />
proximity to major activity centers; vari-<br />
ety in location so that residential devel-<br />
opment can take place in varying<br />
degrees of density.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Local jurisdictions should seek to im-<br />
prove commercial deveiopment by re-<br />
ducing the size of buildings in relation<br /><br />
to total site acreage and increasing<br />
landscape requirements, thereby achiev-<br />
ing compatibility with the surrounding<br />
neighborhood.<br /><br />
Efforts should be made by local jurisdic-<br />
tions to improve industrial developments<br />
by requiring more effective methods of<br />
discharging liquid and solid wastes;<br />
attacking the sources of water and air<br />
pollution; upgrading landscape stand-<br /><br />
mixture of land uses most appropriate<br /><br />
to each.<br /><br />
Implementation Process<br /><br />
A continuing process should be devel-<br />
oped for implementation of the regional<br />
General Development Plan.<br /><br />
The Regional Planning Council can<br />
serve an important role in this process,<br />
working with agents of local, state and<br />
national governments, with private enter-<br />
prise and the citizens of the region.<br /><br />
A regional economic development<br />
advisory committee can prove helpful to<br />
the efforts of organizations to enhance<br />
socio-economic development of the<br />
region.<br /><br />
developers.<br /><br />
Attention needs to be focused on the<br />
regional economy, its characteristics,<br />
and its effects on employment, incomes,<br />
consumer needs and the ability of local<br />
governments to service their populations.<br />
The Regional Planning Council should<br />
continue to develop a broader communi-<br />
cation process for citizens' participation<br />
in implementation of the General Devel-<br />
opment Plan, working with the local<br />
jurisdictions, technical committees,<br />
public and private agencies, citizens’<br />
committees, organizations and associ-<br />
ations.<br /><br />
Community information and education<br />
programs should be expanded, using<br /><br />
all available methods.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

A preliminary solid waste disposal plan<br />
was completed in February, 1972.<br />
Further planning, now underway, should<br />
seriously consider all resource recovery<br />
possibilities.<br /><br />
A preliminary plan for handling storm<br />
drainage problems is now being pre-<br />
pared, but additional funds will be<br />
needed to complete a detailed plan and<br />
program.<br /><br />
The services and utilities described<br />
above all have interjurisdictional impli-<br />
cations. It is recommended that the<br />
local governments in the region formally<br />
cooperate in planning, financing, and<br />
operating water, sewer, storm drainage,<br />
and solid waste disposal services.<br /><br />
Estimated costs for water and sewer<br />
facilities to 1990 is $930 million in<br />
constant dollars. The 1980 annual cost<br />
for debt retirement and operating these<br />
facilities is estimated at $104 million.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Energy: ransmission<br /><br />
i r<br /><br />
Transportation: A high level of service<br />
for the movement of people and goods<br />
and the efficient transmission of<br /><br />
~ energy, consistent with enhancement<br /><br />
of the esthetic, physical, economic<br />
and social environment.<br /><br />
By 1990 travel within the region will<br />
double to more than 4.5 million person<br />
trips per day.<br /><br />
People relying on public transportation<br />
often are very limited as to where they<br />
can go for medical, education, and<br />
recreation services. About 450,000<br />
people in the region live in households<br />
without an automobile.<br /><br />
The ab'ility of the region to maintain<br />
and expand its economic base will<br />
depend to a large degree on the ability<br />
of the transportation system to move<br />
people to employment centers, which<br />
are becoming increasingly decentral-<br />
ized.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
The transportation system must also<br />
accommodate significant increases in<br />
the amount of freight to be moved.<br />
Freight movement facilities, including<br />
highway and rail connections between<br />
freight terminals and their markets are<br />
particularly important to the Port of<br />
Baltimore and Friendship, International<br />
Airport.<br /><br />
An adequate supply and distribution of<br />
energy must be provided in order to<br />
sustain and enhance the quality of life.<br />
Two of the most important energy<br />
challenges facing the region are: to meet<br />
the growing needs and to meet them in<br />
a manner that will minimize harmful<br />
effects to the environment.<br /><br />
Recommendations<br /><br />
An integrated public transportation<br />
system costing $1.8 billion centered on<br />
a regional rapid transit system is essen-<br />
tial to meet the needs of people not<br />
having access to an automobile, to<br />
provide mobility in high density areas<br />
which cannot be adequately served by<br />
highways alone, and to encourage in-<br />
vestment and development at key activity<br />
centers. Two types of rapid transit are<br />
proposed—trains operating in excess<br />
of 75 miles an hour and express and<br />
limited service buses.<br /><br />
Expansion and improvement of the<br />
highway system at a cost of $2.4 billion<br />
is recommended. Almost 85 percent of<br />
the cost of the recommended con-<br />
struction would be in the urban areas<br />
of the region.<br /><br />
Actions should be taken to reduce<br />
travel demand by instituting more<br />
restrictive parking policies, modifying<br />
shift patterns, and improving bus<br />
service. ;<br /><br />
In order to keep the Port of Baltimore<br />
competitive with other east coast ports,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
improvements to both terminal facilities<br />
and highway and rail connections are<br />
essential,<br /><br />
Major improvements are required at<br />
Friendship International Airport, and<br />
general airports will be needed in Anne<br />
Arundel, Carroll, Harford and Baltimore<br />
Counties.<br /><br />
Taxation policies which penalize the<br />
added cost of placing transmission lines<br />
underground, in order to protect the<br />
environment, should be eliminated.<br /><br />
Transportation facilities and energy<br />
transmission corridors should be so<br />
designed and constructed as to mini-<br />
mize disturbance to the natural environ-<br />
ment and residential communities.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Goal<br /><br />
Shelter and Community Development:<br />
Adequate choice from a sufficient<br />
supply of decent homes in suitable<br />
environments within economic reach<br />
of all citizens of the region.<br /><br />
While housing is generally adequate for<br /><br />
‘most people in the Baltimore Region,<br /><br />
it is not yet a reality for a substantial<br />
number of households. The region’s<br />
primary housing problem is a shortage<br />
of adequate units, particularly for low<br />
and moderate income families. For<br />
minority group citizens, equal housing<br />
opportunity is still more hope than<br />
reality.<br /><br />
Some 90,000 of the region’s housing<br />
units are now inadequate and must be<br />
rehabilitated or replaced. The largest<br />
portion of this deficit exists in Baltimore<br />
City. However, some of the more rural<br />
counties contain a substantial percent-<br />
age of inadequate housing.<br /><br />
The cost of housing, particularly for<br />
home buyers, has skyrocketed in recent<br />
years. This has been a major factor in<br />
the growing trend toward the develop-<br />
ment of multi-family rental housing.<br /><br /><br /><br />
There is an increasing awareness that<br />
not only the house, but also its environ-<br />
ment, with attendant public services,<br />
must be improved before the nationally<br />
adopted goal of a “‘decent home in a<br />
suitable living environment’ can be<br />
achieved for all residents of the Balti-<br />
more area.<br /><br />
Patterns of racial and economic dis-<br />
crimination remain in the Baltimore<br />
Region, despite some progress during<br />
the past decade. :<br /><br />
Recommendations<br /><br />
Adequate and suitably located housing<br />
for all of the region’s residents can be<br />
achieved before 1990 provided the<br />
following conditions are met and main-<br />
tained: high volume production and re-<br />
habilitation; realistic income gains and -<br />
housing cost stability; intensified con-<br />
cern about the environment and the<br />
ability of local governments to cope<br />
with urban development pressures;<br />
realization of equal opportunity in both<br />
housing and employment.<br /><br />
Of major importance is closing still<br />
evident gaps in the supply and location<br />
of low- and moderate-income housing<br />
throughout the region. A plan for the<br />
balanced distribution of such housing<br />
will be prepared soon as a supplement<br />
to this General Development Plan.<br /><br />
Meeting region-wide housing needs by<br />
1990 will require 20,000 new and re-<br />
habilitated dwelling units yearly. Their<br />
timing and location should be guided by<br />
a balanced distribution plan. Such a<br />
plan should be prepared soon by the<br />
Area Housing Council for RPC consid-<br />
eration.<br /><br />
Wider use of rehabilitation, replacement<br />
and maintenance programs will be re-<br />
quired to maintain and improve the<br /><br /><br /><br />
general quality of the housing stock,<br />
particularly in areas with older housing.<br />
New housing construction meets for the<br />
most part, additional needs for housing<br />
in new and undeveloped locations.<br />
Continued used of existing housing in<br />
adequate condition meets the bulk of a<br />
community's overall housing needs.<br />
Rehabilitation of as many as 4,000 units<br />
a year will be required to meet total<br />
housing needs. :<br /><br />
Means should be found to hold down<br />
factors contributing to high housing<br />
costs, which go beyond actual construc-<br />
tion. Such factors as high land prices,<br />
land development charges, building<br />
code compliance costs, and closing out-<br />
lays must be reduced.<br /><br />
The quality of residential neighborhood<br />
environments should be maintained and<br />
improved. Rehabilitation and mainte-<br />
nance efforts are necessary in older<br />
neighborhoods throughout the region.<br />
Strong planning and development con-<br />
trols will be required in new suburban<br />
communities. The expanded use of inno-<br />
vative and efficient planned unit devel-<br />
opment should be encouraged.<br /><br />
Development of adequate housing for<br />
all in suitable environmental surround-<br />
ings must be accompanied by equitable<br />
and broad access to employment and<br />
income opportunities throughout the<br />
region. Stronger efforts than those of the<br />
past will be required to achieve this.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Goal<br /><br />
Health: Provide for the best level of<br />
physical and mental health for every<br />
person at all stages of life, and for an<br />
environment which contributes posi-<br />
tively to healthy individual and family<br />
living.<br /><br />
Issues<br /><br />
While many of the resources necessary<br />
to meet the above goal are currently<br />
available, a system is lacking to link the<br />
resources in order to bridge gaps in<br />
service and avoid duplication.<br /><br />
Health indicators for the region show a<br />
less favorable status of health for its<br />
residents than for the State of Maryland<br />
as a whole.<br /><br />
Although health care is now seen as a<br />
right rather than a privilege, many people<br />
lack the means to purchase it. Many of<br />
those who can purchase it are frustrated<br />
in their attempts to find timely and<br />
appropriate service.<br /><br />
The health care system is essentially<br />
sickness-oriented, with few resources<br />
committed to preventing illness or<br />
maintaining positive health.<br /><br />
From 1960 to 1970 the demand for<br />
emergency services in the region has<br />
resulted in a 133 percent increase in<br />
visits to hospital emergency rooms. A<br />
substantial portion of visits were for<br />
non-emergency purposes, because<br />
health care is not readily available for<br />
many people outside the hospital.<br /><br />
Certain weaknesses have been identified<br />
in emergency service for those who<br />
require immediate medical care because<br />
of life-threatening or disabling condi-<br />
tions. They are due in part to the limited<br />
training given to ambulance technicians<br />
and the current practice of transporting<br />
the patient to the nearest hospital<br />
instead of the hospital best able to<br />
handle his injury or illness.<br /><br />
While there are as many psychiatric<br />
hospital beds within the region as there<br />
are medical/surgical beds, mental health<br />
services are grossly underfunded.<br /><br />
A steadily increasing elderly population<br />
within the region demands attention to<br />
the many implications of long-term care.<br /><br />
Recommendations<br /><br />
Maintain and improve a strong health<br />
planning process, with widespread and<br />
active participation by the community.<br /><br />
Formulate and apply health criteria for<br />
engineering and conserving the natural<br />
and man-made environments.<br /><br />
Link resources into service coalitions,<br />
and eliminate duplication and gaps.<br /><br />
Assure every person in the region ready<br />
access to effective and appropriate<br />
health care resources, including primary<br />
(first contact) care.<br /><br />
Improve the effectiveness of the region’s<br />
hospitals in meeting routine care needs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Develop an emergency medical system<br />
with the quality and capacity to provide<br />
appropriate medical care.<br /><br />
Provide a full range of mental health<br />
services.<br /><br />
Develop alternatives for institutional long<br />
term care which will enable individuals<br />
(especially the elderly, chronically ill,<br />
and disabled) to maintain themselves<br />
independently and with dignity in a home<br />
or community setting.<br /><br />
Provide adequate and effective institu-<br />
tional services for those persons requir-<br />
ing specialized medical care or rehabili-<br />
tation. :<br /><br />
Find and apply mechanisms to assure<br />
the financial viability of the region’s<br />
health system.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Goal<br /><br />
Safety and Justice: Adequate and<br />
equal justice and protection of life and<br />
property against crime, fire, traffic<br />
hazards, and other threats to personal<br />
and public safety.<br /><br />
Issues<br /><br />
The Criminal Justice Planning Board of<br />
this region identifies as the number one<br />
priority in crime prevention the early<br />
recognition of delinquent tendencies,<br />
which start when behavior problems<br />
appear during the first years of a child’s<br /><br />
 school life.<br /><br />
Police agencies are still struggling with<br />
problems related to administration, field<br />
services, communications, and training.<br /><br />
On both the circuit and district court<br />
levels, operational dﬁfficulties, such as<br />
overloaded dockets and insufficient per-<br />
sonnel, are causing congestion, slow<br />
administration of justice, and a narrow<br />
range of rehabilitative expectance.<br /><br />
One of the most serious deterrents to<br />
adult rehabilitation is the inability of<br />
local institutions to properly classify,<br />
screen, and diagnose incoming prison-<br />
ers, many of whom are in need of<br />
special programs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Another major obstacle to adult rehabili-<br />
tation is the acute overcrowding of jails<br /><br />
and prisons, and their inability to sepa-<br /><br />
rate juvenile from older offenders. }<br /><br />
A key problem in the rehabilitation of the<br />
juvenile delinquent is the limited number }<br />
of available alternatives to confining him<br />
in an institution.<br /><br />
Adult rehabilitation is impeded by a<br />
serious lack of community correctional<br />
alternatives such as halfway houses,<br />
adequate probation services, and work<br />
release or educational furlough<br />
programs.<br /><br />
Local institutions have a need for addi-<br />
tional manpower allocations and contin-<br />
uing training programs if rehabilitation<br />
is to be effective.<br /><br />
k]<br /><br />
Recommendations<br /><br />
A vast increase in funds is needed for<br />
community-based delinquency preven-<br />
tion programs.<br /><br />
Immediate police needs are additional<br />
personnel and specialized equipment,<br />
an improved modern communications<br />
network, expansion of management and<br />
technical training programs, and intensi-<br />
fied community relations programs.<br /><br />
Measures recommended for increasing<br />
the efficiency of the adjudication process<br />
include: management studies of prose-<br />
cutors’ offices; utilization of automatic<br />
data processing; assignment of para-<br />
professionals for staff support work;<br />
easing of staff limitations in the State’s<br />
Attorney's office to improve pre-trial<br />
screening and case preparation; up-<br />
grading and expanding psychiatric<br />
evaluation services; extension of the<br />
State’s Attorney’s services to juvenile<br />
and district courts.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

PopuUation<br />
and Economy<br />
of theRegion<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Goal<br /><br />
Economic Well-Being: Adequate and<br />
rewarding employment for everyone<br />
able to work; opportunity for securing<br />
goods and services necessary for<br />
satisfactory life in today’s society; eco-<br />
nomical and effective delivery of public<br />
assistance to those who cannot other-<br />
wise provide; sound governmental<br />
fiscal bases and balanced economic<br />
development in the region.<br /><br />
In planning for job opportunities and the<br />
provision of goods and services, it is<br />
essential to estimate as accurately as<br />
possible the future growth, composition,<br />
and distribution of the region’'s popula-<br />
tion.<br /><br />
Birth rate, death rate, and migration data<br /><br />
~ indicate that the total population of the<br /><br />
region will be 2,800,000 by 1990 com-<br />
pared with 2,070,000 in 1970.<br /><br />
In 1990, one quarter of the region’s pop-<br />
ulation will be black, the same propor-<br />
tion as exists today. Eighty percent of<br />
the region’s 1990 black population will<br />
live in Baltimore City. That will represent<br />
an accelerated movement into suburban<br />
counties during the seventies and<br /><br />
|__eighties, doubling the number of black |<br /><br />
residents there.<br /><br />
Between 1970 and 1990 the elderly<br />
population will grow from a little over 8<br />
percent to almost 10 percent.<br /><br />
Although Baltimore City population will<br />
remain close to its present 900,000, it is<br />
expected that the city’s percentage of<br />
the region’s total population will decline<br />
from 45 to 30 percent. On the other<br />
hand, significant growth is anticipated in<br />
the suburban counties.<br /><br />
By 1990, 50,000 people living in the<br />
region will work in Metropolitan Wash-<br />
ington.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Over the period 1970-1990, employment<br />
will increase by about 300,000 jobs to a<br />
level near 1,200,000, and the economy<br />
will continue its shift from goods-<br />
producing to service-producing activi-<br />
ties. Service-job opportunities will tend<br />
to develop near rapidly expanding su-<br />
burban communities, but MetroCenter,<br />
Baltimore’s central business district, will<br />
continue as the financial-administrative-<br />
business service hub of the region.<br /><br />
During the coming decade, there will be<br />
small employment gains in such indus-<br />
tries as construction, transportation,<br />
communications, and public utilities, but<br />
the greatest gains will be in the areas of<br />
finance, trade, government, and other<br />
types of services. In all industry groups,<br />
there should be a notable increase in the<br />
demand for professionals, and a mod-<br />
erate increase in the managerial cate-<br />
gories.<br /><br />
While median family income in the<br />
_region was over $10,000 in 1970, almost<br />
170,000 residents are dependent on<br />
some form of public assistance. Poverty<br />
is most concentrated in the urban core,<br />
but is also found in the rural outer<br />
reaches of the region beyond suburban<br />
development. Poverty is not confined to<br />
the jobless. Fully 70 percent of male<br />
heads of households with incomes be- |<br /><br />
low the officially defined poverty level<br /><br />
have some form of employment.<br /><br />
Many citizens are unable to par@icipate<br />
in the economy because of various<br />
forms of discrimination on the basis of<br />
race, age, or sex, as well as geographic<br />
separation from job opportunities in the<br />
suburban counties.<br /><br />
An increasing number of jobs will call for<br />
skills which require specialized educa-<br />
tion and training. Because of the influx<br />
of young persons into the labor force<br />
during-the past few years, a crisis in<br />
matching skills and work experience to<br />
jobs is occurring.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Interdependence of the several jurisdic-<br />
tions within the regional economy is<br />
evident in_a number of ways, most<br />
notably in the patterns of commuting be-<br />
tween work places and residences. The<br />
city and counties share unequally in<br />
fiscal burdens and public benefits.<br /><br />
Recommendations<br /><br />
Jobs should not only offer employment,<br />
but also opportunities for advancement<br />
at wages sufficient to permit a decent<br />
standard of living.<br /><br />
Discriminatory employment practices<br />
should be identified and abolished.<br /><br />
Efforts should be made to improve public<br />
transportation and to increase the availa-<br />
bility of housing in outlying areas in<br />
order to expand suburban job opportuni-<br />
ties for inner-city residents. Major em-<br />
ployers and the jurisdictions in which<br />
they locate have a responsibility for mak-<br />
ing housing available to workers at<br />
appropriate prices and rents.<br /><br />
Local economic development activities<br />
should be linked to manpower training<br />
and development programs in order that<br />
occupational requirements of industry<br />
can be balanced with the skills of the<br />
labor force. ¢<br /><br />
quired to reduce the inequities in tax<br />
base structure which result from current<br />
commuting patterns.<br /><br />
Naitural<br />
Enviionment<br /><br />
Goal<br /><br />
Natural Environment: Preservation and<br />
enhancement of sunlight, air, water<br />
and land resources, the wildlife and<br />
vegatation of the region in order to<br />
support and enrich human life.<br /><br />
The wholesale clearance of woodlands<br />
and forests has resulted in flooding<br />
and erosion, with silt entering and<br />
polluting watercourses.<br /><br />
The Chesapeake Bay has been addi-<br />
tionally menaced by storm runoff from<br /><br />
city streets, poorly treated municipal<br /><br />
wastewater, industrial pqllution, ship<br />
bilge and oil spills.<br /><br />
Access to the bay's beaches has been<br />
steadiiy declining because of pollution,<br />
erosion by wave action, and residential<br />
development along the shoreline.<br /><br />
A rapid decrease in the number and<br />
species of wildlife has resulted from<br />
the depletion of woodlands and wet-<br />
lands, their natural habitat.<br /><br />
The region shares in widespread air<br /><br />
“pollution which has become a national<br /><br /><br /><br />
problem:. L<br /><br />
Key agricultural lands, important to the<br />
economy and beauty of the region, are<br />
very inviting to prospective developers.<br /><br /><br /><br />
""~ flood waters should be instituted.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Recommendations<br /><br />
It is vital that the region’s water, land,<br />
and air resources be protected by<br />
reducing pollution.<br /><br />
Enforcement of laws regarding sedimen-<br />
tation control, dumping untreated wastes<br />
from ships, oil spills, and other land and<br />
water pollution control measures should<br /><br />
be strongly supported.<br /><br />
Development patterns which respect the<br />
natural environment should be en-<br />
couraged by the careful placement of<br />
public utilities such as water, sewers<br />
and highways in areas most appro-<br />
priate for development.<br /><br />
Septic tank use should be carefully<br />
controlled.<br /><br />
Measures should be taken to assure<br />
public access to streams, rivers, and<br />
the Chesapeake.Bay, including acquisi-<br />
tion of waterfront parks.<br /><br />
Preservation of wetlands should be<br />
encouraged.<br /><br />
Development on slopes in excess of<br />
20 percent should be limited, and public<br />
control of such slopes increased.<br /><br />
Areas within 100-year flood plains<br />
should be kept free from development,<br />
and other new approaches for managing<br /><br />
Vion-Made<br />
EnvironmMent<br /><br /><br /><br />
Goal<br /><br />
Man-made environment: To improve<br />
the quality of development, create<br />
image and character, protect and en-<br />
hance the cultural, historic, visual, and<br />
ecological assets of the region’s man-<br />
made environment.<br /><br />
One of the essentials of an enriching and<br />
satisfying environment is a strengthening<br />
of the region’s overall image. The<br />
Baltimore Region has capitalized to only<br />
a limited degree on its unique features—<br />
the Chesapeake Bay, the Harbor, the<br /><br />
Too often urban areas are developed<br />
on a piecemeal basis rather than<br />
according to standards and criteria that<br />
would produce a harmonious, coherent<br />
environment.<br /><br />
Recommendations<br /><br />
A visual image for the region should be<br />
created by means of design and de-<br />
velopment policies which enhance the<br />
quality of the region’s man-made en-<br />
vironment.<br /><br />
The region should be classified into<br />
development districts with a recognition<br />
of their wide diversity and differing<br />
design requirements.<br /><br />
Roads link individual districts into a<br />
series of continuous experiences and<br />
therefore should be designed to enhance<br />
the environments through which they<br />
pass. Standards for roadways should be<br />
established which will guide alignments,<br />
landscaping, and roadside development.<br /><br />
_Conservation policies should be applied<br /><br />
to structures and districts with archi-<br />
tectural, historic, cultural or social<br />
significance, as well as to unique<br />
natural features and vistas.<br /><br />
Landscaping should not be construed<br />
as just the application of plant materials,<br /><br />
[Recreationona<br />
Open Sooce<br /><br /><br /><br />
Goal<br /><br />
Recreation and Open Space: Oppor-<br />
tunities sufficient to accommodate the<br />
full range of human needs for recrea-<br />
tion, and open spaces sufficient to<br />
meet the region’s conservation needs.<br /><br />
Recreation and leisure time experiences<br />
are important in meeting the need for<br />
relief from the routine and repetitive<br />
activities of daily life.<br /><br />
Growth in many forms of recreation has<br />
taken place in recent years, and there<br /><br />
Recommendations<br /><br />
A system of regional activity areas and<br />
recreation corridors, including a trail<br />
system, should be created.<br /><br />
Neighborhood and community recrea-<br />
tion centers and parks should be estab-<br />
lished close to where people live.<br /><br />
Unique historic and cultural areas<br />
should be protected to give people a<br />
sense of continuity with past events and<br />
ways of life in the region. ‘<br /><br />
An additional 176,000 acres in the<br />
regional open space system and 25,000<br />
acres in the local open space system<br />
need protection by 1990.<br /><br />
The recommended open space plan will<br />
cost $521 million for acquisition and<br />
development and up to @ maximum of<br />
$37 million per year for operation and<br />
maintenance. z<br /><br />
A financial plan and program should be<br />
undertaken to systematically éstablish<br />
priorities and funding schedules. Maxi-<br />
mum state and federal aid should be<br />
sought.<br /><br />
Sewerage, Water,<br /><br />
aond Sold Waistes<br /><br />
Goal<br /><br />
Utilities: A supply of safe water for all<br />
uses, and satisfactory disposal<br />
methods for liquid and solid wastes,<br />
all in the context of sound environ-<br />
mental health planning.<br /><br />
The ability of sewage treatment plants<br />
to handle adequately the wastewater<br />
which reaches them, the capacity of<br />
pipelines to carry the wastes, and the<br />
ability of receiving waters to assimilate<br />
the effluent are important to health and<br /><br />
Dr: N<br />

is-every-indication-thatincrease-in<br /><br /><br /><br />
Tree planting throughout the region<br />
should be encouraged and tree clear-<br />
ance by developers allowed only by<br />
permit.<br /><br />
Air pollution sources should be identi-<br />
fied, and state and county health<br />
department regulations should be<br />
supported and enforced.<br /><br />
Naise pollution should be kept to a level<br />
which is not injurious to individual<br />
health.-<br /><br />
Prime agricultural lands should be<br />
preserved for agricultural purposes and<br />
strong measures should be taken to<br />
protect them from development.<br /><br /><br /><br />
valleys, the Baltimore skyline—all of<br />
which create a distinctive character.<br /><br />
The strength of the region as a dis~<br />
tinctive, satisfying environment is parti-<br />
ally dependent on the accumulated<br />
effect of the areas or districts which<br /><br />
 compose it. This requires highlighting<br /><br />
the outstanding féatures and character-<br />
istics of each district.<br /><br />
The traveler receives an impression of<br />
districts from roadways, which tend to<br />
identify and define their major features<br /><br />
and character. Poorly located junk yards, .<br /><br />
service stations, oversize or garish signs<br />
exemplify features 'which detract from<br />
the character of urban areas.<br /><br /><br /><br />
but also as the fabric of the environ-<br />
ment into which spaces and structures<br />
are woven. Landscape plans should be<br />
prepared for towns and communities<br />
the region.<br /><br />
The Regional Planning Council should<br />
establish guidelines and offer assistance<br />
to local jurisdictions in the formulation<br />
of design policies.<br /><br />
recreation demands will continue into<br />
the future.<br /><br />
The acquisition or protection of open<br />
space is urgent, as urban growth in the<br />
Baltimore Region between now and<br /><br />
-1990 is likely to consume about 100,000<br /><br />
acres.<br /><br />
Open spaces are important in order to<br />
preserve natural features and determine<br />
the lotation of urban development in<br />
the region. 4<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Failing septic tanks create health<br />
hazards and nuisances. In the urbanizing<br />
sectors of the region, overflowing septic<br />
tanks pollute streams and estuarine<br />
rivers that drain the coastal plain.<br /><br />
The demand for treated water is steadily<br />
increasing. Present use is 250 million<br />
gallons per day or 68 percent of the<br />
supply. By 1980, it is estimated that it<br />
will rise to 303 million gallons per day<br />
or 83 percent of the supply. If use con-<br />
tinues to increase at this rate, the present<br />
developed supply of water will be in-<br />
adequate after the year 2000.<br /><br />
Two important issues in the increasingly<br />
serious problem of solid wastes disposal<br />
are the location of disposal sites and a<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
reluctance to experiment with tech-<br />
nological advances which would pro-<br />
vide more efficient collection and<br />
disposal systems.<br /><br />
The widespread destruction by the<br />
storm “Agnes’’ in June, 1972, highlights<br />
the need for storm drainage and flood<br />
prevention measures to be taken by<br />
agencies of the region.<br /><br />
Recommendations<br /><br />
Development should be prohibited in<br />
areas where public sewerage facilities<br />
are not available and where soil or<br />
topographic conditions are unsuitable<br />
for individual septic tanks.<br /><br />
The Back River and Patapsco River<br />
wastewater treatment plants serve about<br /><br />
70 percent of the region’s population.<br /><br />
The larger of the two, the Back River<br /><br />
plant, is now undergoing extension and<br />
modernization; a development and con-<br />
struction program has been designed for |<br />
the Patapsco River plant. Smaller waste-<br />
water treatment plants will also be re- |<br />
quired to accommodate a growing<br />
population.<br /><br />
To correct septic tank problems, owners<br />
should be required to take one of the |<br />
following actions: construction of new -<br />
septic tank drainage fields; installation |<br />
of limited service community disposal |<br />
systems; tapping into existing public |<br />
facilities. The method selected would |<br />
depend on individual circumstances, the<br />
location of the property, and water |<br />
quality requirements.<br /><br />
\<br /><br />
\<br /><br />
If water use continues to rise at its<br /><br />
present rate, additional sources will be<br />
needed after the year 2000. These might<br /><br />
be an increase in the already existing |<br />
Susquehanna River supply, development ‘<br />
of a new source on the Potomac River,<br />
recycling of used water, distillation, and<br />
other measures which are being cur-<br />
rently investigated. -~<br /><br />

<br />
A preliminary solid waste disposal plan<br />
was completed in February, 1972.<br />
Further planning, now underway, should<br />
seriously consider all resource recovery<br />
possibilities.<br />
<br />
A preliminary plan for handling storm<br />
drainage problems is now being pre-<br />
pared, but additional funds will be<br />
needed to complete a detailed plan and<br />
program.<br />
<br />
The services and utilities described<br />
above all have interjurisdictional impli-<br />
cations. It is recommended that the<br />
local governments in the region formally<br />
cooperate in planning, financing, and<br />
operating water, sewer, storm drainage,<br />
and solid waste disposal services.<br />
<br />
Estimated costs for water and sewer<br />
facilities to 1990 is $930 million in<br />
constant dollars. The 1980 annual cost<br />
for debt retirement and operating these<br />
facilities is estimated at $104 million.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Energy: ransmission<br />
<br />
i r<br />
<br />
Transportation: A high level of service<br />
for the movement of people and goods<br />
and the efficient transmission of<br />
<br />
~ energy, consistent with enhancement<br />
<br />
of the esthetic, physical, economic<br />
and social environment.<br />
<br />
By 1990 travel within the region will<br />
double to more than 4.5 million person<br />
trips per day.<br />
<br />
People relying on public transportation<br />
often are very limited as to where they<br />
can go for medical, education, and<br />
recreation services. About 450,000<br />
people in the region live in households<br />
without an automobile.<br />
<br />
The ab'ility of the region to maintain<br />
and expand its economic base will<br />
depend to a large degree on the ability<br />
of the transportation system to move<br />
people to employment centers, which<br />
are becoming increasingly decentral-<br />
ized.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The transportation system must also<br />
accommodate significant increases in<br />
the amount of freight to be moved.<br />
Freight movement facilities, including<br />
highway and rail connections between<br />
freight terminals and their markets are<br />
particularly important to the Port of<br />
Baltimore and Friendship, International<br />
Airport.<br />
<br />
An adequate supply and distribution of<br />
energy must be provided in order to<br />
sustain and enhance the quality of life.<br />
Two of the most important energy<br />
challenges facing the region are: to meet<br />
the growing needs and to meet them in<br />
a manner that will minimize harmful<br />
effects to the environment.<br />
<br />
Recommendations<br />
<br />
An integrated public transportation<br />
system costing $1.8 billion centered on<br />
a regional rapid transit system is essen-<br />
tial to meet the needs of people not<br />
having access to an automobile, to<br />
provide mobility in high density areas<br />
which cannot be adequately served by<br />
highways alone, and to encourage in-<br />
vestment and development at key activity<br />
centers. Two types of rapid transit are<br />
proposed—trains operating in excess<br />
of 75 miles an hour and express and<br />
limited service buses.<br />
<br />
Expansion and improvement of the<br />
highway system at a cost of $2.4 billion<br />
is recommended. Almost 85 percent of<br />
the cost of the recommended con-<br />
struction would be in the urban areas<br />
of the region.<br />
<br />
Actions should be taken to reduce<br />
travel demand by instituting more<br />
restrictive parking policies, modifying<br />
shift patterns, and improving bus<br />
service. ;<br />
<br />
In order to keep the Port of Baltimore<br />
competitive with other east coast ports,<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
improvements to both terminal facilities<br />
and highway and rail connections are<br />
essential,<br />
<br />
Major improvements are required at<br />
Friendship International Airport, and<br />
general airports will be needed in Anne<br />
Arundel, Carroll, Harford and Baltimore<br />
Counties.<br />
<br />
Taxation policies which penalize the<br />
added cost of placing transmission lines<br />
underground, in order to protect the<br />
environment, should be eliminated.<br />
<br />
Transportation facilities and energy<br />
transmission corridors should be so<br />
designed and constructed as to mini-<br />
mize disturbance to the natural environ-<br />
ment and residential communities.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Goal<br />
<br />
Shelter and Community Development:<br />
Adequate choice from a sufficient<br />
supply of decent homes in suitable<br />
environments within economic reach<br />
of all citizens of the region.<br />
<br />
While housing is generally adequate for<br />
<br />
‘most people in the Baltimore Region,<br />
<br />
it is not yet a reality for a substantial<br />
number of households. The region’s<br />
primary housing problem is a shortage<br />
of adequate units, particularly for low<br />
and moderate income families. For<br />
minority group citizens, equal housing<br />
opportunity is still more hope than<br />
reality.<br />
<br />
Some 90,000 of the region’s housing<br />
units are now inadequate and must be<br />
rehabilitated or replaced. The largest<br />
portion of this deficit exists in Baltimore<br />
City. However, some of the more rural<br />
counties contain a substantial percent-<br />
age of inadequate housing.<br />
<br />
The cost of housing, particularly for<br />
home buyers, has skyrocketed in recent<br />
years. This has been a major factor in<br />
the growing trend toward the develop-<br />
ment of multi-family rental housing.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
There is an increasing awareness that<br />
not only the house, but also its environ-<br />
ment, with attendant public services,<br />
must be improved before the nationally<br />
adopted goal of a “‘decent home in a<br />
suitable living environment’ can be<br />
achieved for all residents of the Balti-<br />
more area.<br />
<br />
Patterns of racial and economic dis-<br />
crimination remain in the Baltimore<br />
Region, despite some progress during<br />
the past decade. :<br />
<br />
Recommendations<br />
<br />
Adequate and suitably located housing<br />
for all of the region’s residents can be<br />
achieved before 1990 provided the<br />
following conditions are met and main-<br />
tained: high volume production and re-<br />
habilitation; realistic income gains and -<br />
housing cost stability; intensified con-<br />
cern about the environment and the<br />
ability of local governments to cope<br />
with urban development pressures;<br />
realization of equal opportunity in both<br />
housing and employment.<br />
<br />
Of major importance is closing still<br />
evident gaps in the supply and location<br />
of low- and moderate-income housing<br />
throughout the region. A plan for the<br />
balanced distribution of such housing<br />
will be prepared soon as a supplement<br />
to this General Development Plan.<br />
<br />
Meeting region-wide housing needs by<br />
1990 will require 20,000 new and re-<br />
habilitated dwelling units yearly. Their<br />
timing and location should be guided by<br />
a balanced distribution plan. Such a<br />
plan should be prepared soon by the<br />
Area Housing Council for RPC consid-<br />
eration.<br />
<br />
Wider use of rehabilitation, replacement<br />
and maintenance programs will be re-<br />
quired to maintain and improve the<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
general quality of the housing stock,<br />
particularly in areas with older housing.<br />
New housing construction meets for the<br />
most part, additional needs for housing<br />
in new and undeveloped locations.<br />
Continued used of existing housing in<br />
adequate condition meets the bulk of a<br />
community's overall housing needs.<br />
Rehabilitation of as many as 4,000 units<br />
a year will be required to meet total<br />
housing needs. :<br />
<br />
Means should be found to hold down<br />
factors contributing to high housing<br />
costs, which go beyond actual construc-<br />
tion. Such factors as high land prices,<br />
land development charges, building<br />
code compliance costs, and closing out-<br />
lays must be reduced.<br />
<br />
The quality of residential neighborhood<br />
environments should be maintained and<br />
improved. Rehabilitation and mainte-<br />
nance efforts are necessary in older<br />
neighborhoods throughout the region.<br />
Strong planning and development con-<br />
trols will be required in new suburban<br />
communities. The expanded use of inno-<br />
vative and efficient planned unit devel-<br />
opment should be encouraged.<br />
<br />
Development of adequate housing for<br />
all in suitable environmental surround-<br />
ings must be accompanied by equitable<br />
and broad access to employment and<br />
income opportunities throughout the<br />
region. Stronger efforts than those of the<br />
past will be required to achieve this.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Goal<br />
<br />
Health: Provide for the best level of<br />
physical and mental health for every<br />
person at all stages of life, and for an<br />
environment which contributes posi-<br />
tively to healthy individual and family<br />
living.<br />
<br />
Issues<br />
<br />
While many of the resources necessary<br />
to meet the above goal are currently<br />
available, a system is lacking to link the<br />
resources in order to bridge gaps in<br />
service and avoid duplication.<br />
<br />
Health indicators for the region show a<br />
less favorable status of health for its<br />
residents than for the State of Maryland<br />
as a whole.<br />
<br />
Although health care is now seen as a<br />
right rather than a privilege, many people<br />
lack the means to purchase it. Many of<br />
those who can purchase it are frustrated<br />
in their attempts to find timely and<br />
appropriate service.<br />
<br />
The health care system is essentially<br />
sickness-oriented, with few resources<br />
committed to preventing illness or<br />
maintaining positive health.<br />
<br />
From 1960 to 1970 the demand for<br />
emergency services in the region has<br />
resulted in a 133 percent increase in<br />
visits to hospital emergency rooms. A<br />
substantial portion of visits were for<br />
non-emergency purposes, because<br />
health care is not readily available for<br />
many people outside the hospital.<br />
<br />
Certain weaknesses have been identified<br />
in emergency service for those who<br />
require immediate medical care because<br />
of life-threatening or disabling condi-<br />
tions. They are due in part to the limited<br />
training given to ambulance technicians<br />
and the current practice of transporting<br />
the patient to the nearest hospital<br />
instead of the hospital best able to<br />
handle his injury or illness.<br />
<br />
While there are as many psychiatric<br />
hospital beds within the region as there<br />
are medical/surgical beds, mental health<br />
services are grossly underfunded.<br />
<br />
A steadily increasing elderly population<br />
within the region demands attention to<br />
the many implications of long-term care.<br />
<br />
Recommendations<br />
<br />
Maintain and improve a strong health<br />
planning process, with widespread and<br />
active participation by the community.<br />
<br />
Formulate and apply health criteria for<br />
engineering and conserving the natural<br />
and man-made environments.<br />
<br />
Link resources into service coalitions,<br />
and eliminate duplication and gaps.<br />
<br />
Assure every person in the region ready<br />
access to effective and appropriate<br />
health care resources, including primary<br />
(first contact) care.<br />
<br />
Improve the effectiveness of the region’s<br />
hospitals in meeting routine care needs.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Develop an emergency medical system<br />
with the quality and capacity to provide<br />
appropriate medical care.<br />
<br />
Provide a full range of mental health<br />
services.<br />
<br />
Develop alternatives for institutional long<br />
term care which will enable individuals<br />
(especially the elderly, chronically ill,<br />
and disabled) to maintain themselves<br />
independently and with dignity in a home<br />
or community setting.<br />
<br />
Provide adequate and effective institu-<br />
tional services for those persons requir-<br />
ing specialized medical care or rehabili-<br />
tation. :<br />
<br />
Find and apply mechanisms to assure<br />
the financial viability of the region’s<br />
health system.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Goal<br />
<br />
Safety and Justice: Adequate and<br />
equal justice and protection of life and<br />
property against crime, fire, traffic<br />
hazards, and other threats to personal<br />
and public safety.<br />
<br />
Issues<br />
<br />
The Criminal Justice Planning Board of<br />
this region identifies as the number one<br />
priority in crime prevention the early<br />
recognition of delinquent tendencies,<br />
which start when behavior problems<br />
appear during the first years of a child’s<br />
<br />
 school life.<br />
<br />
Police agencies are still struggling with<br />
problems related to administration, field<br />
services, communications, and training.<br />
<br />
On both the circuit and district court<br />
levels, operational dﬁfficulties, such as<br />
overloaded dockets and insufficient per-<br />
sonnel, are causing congestion, slow<br />
administration of justice, and a narrow<br />
range of rehabilitative expectance.<br />
<br />
One of the most serious deterrents to<br />
adult rehabilitation is the inability of<br />
local institutions to properly classify,<br />
screen, and diagnose incoming prison-<br />
ers, many of whom are in need of<br />
special programs.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Another major obstacle to adult rehabili-<br />
tation is the acute overcrowding of jails<br />
<br />
and prisons, and their inability to sepa-<br />
<br />
rate juvenile from older offenders. }<br />
<br />
A key problem in the rehabilitation of the<br />
juvenile delinquent is the limited number }<br />
of available alternatives to confining him<br />
in an institution.<br />
<br />
Adult rehabilitation is impeded by a<br />
serious lack of community correctional<br />
alternatives such as halfway houses,<br />
adequate probation services, and work<br />
release or educational furlough<br />
programs.<br />
<br />
Local institutions have a need for addi-<br />
tional manpower allocations and contin-<br />
uing training programs if rehabilitation<br />
is to be effective.<br />
<br />
k]<br />
<br />
Recommendations<br />
<br />
A vast increase in funds is needed for<br />
community-based delinquency preven-<br />
tion programs.<br />
<br />
Immediate police needs are additional<br />
personnel and specialized equipment,<br />
an improved modern communications<br />
network, expansion of management and<br />
technical training programs, and intensi-<br />
fied community relations programs.<br />
<br />
Measures recommended for increasing<br />
the efficiency of the adjudication process<br />
include: management studies of prose-<br />
cutors’ offices; utilization of automatic<br />
data processing; assignment of para-<br />
professionals for staff support work;<br />
easing of staff limitations in the State’s<br />
Attorney's office to improve pre-trial<br />
screening and case preparation; up-<br />
grading and expanding psychiatric<br />
evaluation services; extension of the<br />
State’s Attorney’s services to juvenile<br />
and district courts.<br />

<br />
PopuUation<br />
and Economy<br />
of theRegion<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Goal<br />
<br />
Economic Well-Being: Adequate and<br />
rewarding employment for everyone<br />
able to work; opportunity for securing<br />
goods and services necessary for<br />
satisfactory life in today’s society; eco-<br />
nomical and effective delivery of public<br />
assistance to those who cannot other-<br />
wise provide; sound governmental<br />
fiscal bases and balanced economic<br />
development in the region.<br />
<br />
In planning for job opportunities and the<br />
provision of goods and services, it is<br />
essential to estimate as accurately as<br />
possible the future growth, composition,<br />
and distribution of the region’'s popula-<br />
tion.<br />
<br />
Birth rate, death rate, and migration data<br />
<br />
~ indicate that the total population of the<br />
<br />
region will be 2,800,000 by 1990 com-<br />
pared with 2,070,000 in 1970.<br />
<br />
In 1990, one quarter of the region’s pop-<br />
ulation will be black, the same propor-<br />
tion as exists today. Eighty percent of<br />
the region’s 1990 black population will<br />
live in Baltimore City. That will represent<br />
an accelerated movement into suburban<br />
counties during the seventies and<br />
<br />
|__eighties, doubling the number of black |<br />
<br />
residents there.<br />
<br />
Between 1970 and 1990 the elderly<br />
population will grow from a little over 8<br />
percent to almost 10 percent.<br />
<br />
Although Baltimore City population will<br />
remain close to its present 900,000, it is<br />
expected that the city’s percentage of<br />
the region’s total population will decline<br />
from 45 to 30 percent. On the other<br />
hand, significant growth is anticipated in<br />
the suburban counties.<br />
<br />
By 1990, 50,000 people living in the<br />
region will work in Metropolitan Wash-<br />
ington.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Over the period 1970-1990, employment<br />
will increase by about 300,000 jobs to a<br />
level near 1,200,000, and the economy<br />
will continue its shift from goods-<br />
producing to service-producing activi-<br />
ties. Service-job opportunities will tend<br />
to develop near rapidly expanding su-<br />
burban communities, but MetroCenter,<br />
Baltimore’s central business district, will<br />
continue as the financial-administrative-<br />
business service hub of the region.<br />
<br />
During the coming decade, there will be<br />
small employment gains in such indus-<br />
tries as construction, transportation,<br />
communications, and public utilities, but<br />
the greatest gains will be in the areas of<br />
finance, trade, government, and other<br />
types of services. In all industry groups,<br />
there should be a notable increase in the<br />
demand for professionals, and a mod-<br />
erate increase in the managerial cate-<br />
gories.<br />
<br />
While median family income in the<br />
_region was over $10,000 in 1970, almost<br />
170,000 residents are dependent on<br />
some form of public assistance. Poverty<br />
is most concentrated in the urban core,<br />
but is also found in the rural outer<br />
reaches of the region beyond suburban<br />
development. Poverty is not confined to<br />
the jobless. Fully 70 percent of male<br />
heads of households with incomes be- |<br />
<br />
low the officially defined poverty level<br />
<br />
have some form of employment.<br />
<br />
Many citizens are unable to par@icipate<br />
in the economy because of various<br />
forms of discrimination on the basis of<br />
race, age, or sex, as well as geographic<br />
separation from job opportunities in the<br />
suburban counties.<br />
<br />
An increasing number of jobs will call for<br />
skills which require specialized educa-<br />
tion and training. Because of the influx<br />
of young persons into the labor force<br />
during-the past few years, a crisis in<br />
matching skills and work experience to<br />
jobs is occurring.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Interdependence of the several jurisdic-<br />
tions within the regional economy is<br />
evident in_a number of ways, most<br />
notably in the patterns of commuting be-<br />
tween work places and residences. The<br />
city and counties share unequally in<br />
fiscal burdens and public benefits.<br />
<br />
Recommendations<br />
<br />
Jobs should not only offer employment,<br />
but also opportunities for advancement<br />
at wages sufficient to permit a decent<br />
standard of living.<br />
<br />
Discriminatory employment practices<br />
should be identified and abolished.<br />
<br />
Efforts should be made to improve public<br />
transportation and to increase the availa-<br />
bility of housing in outlying areas in<br />
order to expand suburban job opportuni-<br />
ties for inner-city residents. Major em-<br />
ployers and the jurisdictions in which<br />
they locate have a responsibility for mak-<br />
ing housing available to workers at<br />
appropriate prices and rents.<br />
<br />
Local economic development activities<br />
should be linked to manpower training<br />
and development programs in order that<br />
occupational requirements of industry<br />
can be balanced with the skills of the<br />
labor force. ¢<br />
<br />

Natural Environment: Preservation and<br />
enhancement of sunlight, air, water<br />
and land resources, the wildlife and<br />
vegatation of the region in order to<br />
support and enrich human life.<br />
<br />
The wholesale clearance of woodlands<br />
and forests has resulted in flooding<br />
and erosion, with silt entering and<br />
polluting watercourses.<br />
<br />
The Chesapeake Bay has been addi-<br />
tionally menaced by storm runoff from<br />
<br />
city streets, poorly treated municipal<br />
<br />
wastewater, industrial pqllution, ship<br />
bilge and oil spills.<br />
<br />
Access to the bay's beaches has been<br />
steadiiy declining because of pollution,<br />
erosion by wave action, and residential<br />
development along the shoreline.<br />
<br />
A rapid decrease in the number and<br />
species of wildlife has resulted from<br />
the depletion of woodlands and wet-<br />
lands, their natural habitat.<br />
<br />
The region shares in widespread air<br />
<br />
“pollution which has become a national<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
problem:. L<br />
<br />
Key agricultural lands, important to the<br />
economy and beauty of the region, are<br />
very inviting to prospective developers.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
""~ flood waters should be instituted.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Recommendations<br />
<br />
It is vital that the region’s water, land,<br />
and air resources be protected by<br />
reducing pollution.<br />
<br />
Enforcement of laws regarding sedimen-<br />
tation control, dumping untreated wastes<br />
from ships, oil spills, and other land and<br />
water pollution control measures should<br />
<br />
be strongly supported.<br />
<br />
Development patterns which respect the<br />
natural environment should be en-<br />
couraged by the careful placement of<br />
public utilities such as water, sewers<br />
and highways in areas most appro-<br />
priate for development.<br />
<br />
Septic tank use should be carefully<br />
controlled.<br />
<br />
Measures should be taken to assure<br />
public access to streams, rivers, and<br />
the Chesapeake.Bay, including acquisi-<br />
tion of waterfront parks.<br />
<br />
Preservation of wetlands should be<br />
encouraged.<br />
<br />
Development on slopes in excess of<br />
20 percent should be limited, and public<br />
control of such slopes increased.<br />
<br />
Areas within 100-year flood plains<br />
should be kept free from development,<br />
and other new approaches for managing<br />
<br />
Vion-Made<br />
EnvironmMent<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Goal<br />
<br />
Man-made environment: To improve<br />
the quality of development, create<br />
image and character, protect and en-<br />
hance the cultural, historic, visual, and<br />
ecological assets of the region’s man-<br />
made environment.<br />
<br />
One of the essentials of an enriching and<br />
satisfying environment is a strengthening<br />
of the region’s overall image. The<br />
Baltimore Region has capitalized to only<br />
a limited degree on its unique features—<br />
the Chesapeake Bay, the Harbor, the<br />
<br />
Too often urban areas are developed<br />
on a piecemeal basis rather than<br />
according to standards and criteria that<br />
would produce a harmonious, coherent<br />
environment.<br />
<br />
Recommendations<br />
<br />
A visual image for the region should be<br />
created by means of design and de-<br />
velopment policies which enhance the<br />
quality of the region’s man-made en-<br />
vironment.<br />
<br />
The region should be classified into<br />
development districts with a recognition<br />
of their wide diversity and differing<br />
design requirements.<br />
<br />
Roads link individual districts into a<br />
series of continuous experiences and<br />
therefore should be designed to enhance<br />
the environments through which they<br />
pass. Standards for roadways should be<br />
established which will guide alignments,<br />
landscaping, and roadside development.<br />
<br />
_Conservation policies should be applied<br />
<br />
to structures and districts with archi-<br />
tectural, historic, cultural or social<br />
significance, as well as to unique<br />
natural features and vistas.<br />
<br />
Landscaping should not be construed<br />
as just the application of plant materials,<br />
<br />
[Recreationona<br />
Open Sooce<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Goal<br />
<br />
Recreation and Open Space: Oppor-<br />
tunities sufficient to accommodate the<br />
full range of human needs for recrea-<br />
tion, and open spaces sufficient to<br />
meet the region’s conservation needs.<br />
<br />
Recreation and leisure time experiences<br />
are important in meeting the need for<br />
relief from the routine and repetitive<br />
activities of daily life.<br />
<br />
Growth in many forms of recreation has<br />
taken place in recent years, and there<br />
<br />
Recommendations<br />
<br />
A system of regional activity areas and<br />
recreation corridors, including a trail<br />
system, should be created.<br />
<br />
Neighborhood and community recrea-<br />
tion centers and parks should be estab-<br />
lished close to where people live.<br />
<br />
Unique historic and cultural areas<br />
should be protected to give people a<br />
sense of continuity with past events and<br />
ways of life in the region. ‘<br />
<br />
An additional 176,000 acres in the<br />
regional open space system and 25,000<br />
acres in the local open space system<br />
need protection by 1990.<br />
<br />
The recommended open space plan will<br />
cost $521 million for acquisition and<br />
development and up to @ maximum of<br />
$37 million per year for operation and<br />
maintenance. z<br />
<br />
A financial plan and program should be<br />
undertaken to systematically éstablish<br />
priorities and funding schedules. Maxi-<br />
mum state and federal aid should be<br />
sought.<br />

The ability of sewage treatment plants<br />

 <br />
<br />
Tree planting throughout the region<br />
should be encouraged and tree clear-<br />
ance by developers allowed only by<br />
permit.<br />
<br />
Air pollution sources should be identi-<br />
fied, and state and county health<br />
department regulations should be<br />
supported and enforced.<br />
<br />
Naise pollution should be kept to a level<br />
which is not injurious to individual<br />
health.-<br />
<br />
Prime agricultural lands should be<br />
preserved for agricultural purposes and<br />
strong measures should be taken to<br />
protect them from development.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
valleys, the Baltimore skyline—all of<br />
which create a distinctive character.<br />
<br />
The strength of the region as a dis~<br />
tinctive, satisfying environment is parti-<br />
ally dependent on the accumulated<br />
effect of the areas or districts which<br />
<br />
 compose it. This requires highlighting<br />
<br />
the outstanding féatures and character-<br />
istics of each district.<br />
<br />
The traveler receives an impression of<br />
districts from roadways, which tend to<br />
identify and define their major features<br />
<br />
and character. Poorly located junk yards, .<br />
<br />
service stations, oversize or garish signs<br />
exemplify features 'which detract from<br />
the character of urban areas.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
but also as the fabric of the environ-<br />
ment into which spaces and structures<br />
are woven. Landscape plans should be<br />
prepared for towns and communities<br />
the region.<br />
<br />
The Regional Planning Council should<br />
establish guidelines and offer assistance<br />
to local jurisdictions in the formulation<br />
of design policies.<br />
<br />
recreation demands will continue into<br />
the future.<br />
<br />
The acquisition or protection of open<br />
space is urgent, as urban growth in the<br />
Baltimore Region between now and<br />
<br />
-1990 is likely to consume about 100,000<br />
<br />
acres.<br />
<br />
Open spaces are important in order to<br />
preserve natural features and determine<br />
the lotation of urban development in<br />
the region. 4<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Failing septic tanks create health<br />
hazards and nuisances. In the urbanizing<br />
sectors of the region, overflowing septic<br />
tanks pollute streams and estuarine<br />
rivers that drain the coastal plain.<br />
<br />
The demand for treated water is steadily<br />
increasing. Present use is 250 million<br />
gallons per day or 68 percent of the<br />
supply. By 1980, it is estimated that it<br />
will rise to 303 million gallons per day<br />
or 83 percent of the supply. If use con-<br />
tinues to increase at this rate, the present<br />
developed supply of water will be in-<br />
adequate after the year 2000.<br />
<br />
Two important issues in the increasingly<br />
serious problem of solid wastes disposal<br />
are the location of disposal sites and a<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
reluctance to experiment with tech-<br />
nological advances which would pro-<br />
vide more efficient collection and<br />
disposal systems.<br />
<br />
The widespread destruction by the<br />
storm “Agnes’’ in June, 1972, highlights<br />
the need for storm drainage and flood<br />
prevention measures to be taken by<br />
agencies of the region.<br />
<br />
Recommendations<br />
<br />
Development should be prohibited in<br />
areas where public sewerage facilities<br />
are not available and where soil or<br />
topographic conditions are unsuitable<br />
for individual septic tanks.<br />
<br />
The Back River and Patapsco River<br />
wastewater treatment plants serve about<br />
<br />
70 percent of the region’s population.<br />
<br />
The larger of the two, the Back River<br />
<br />
plant, is now undergoing extension and<br />
modernization; a development and con-<br />
struction program has been designed for |<br />
the Patapsco River plant. Smaller waste-<br />
water treatment plants will also be re- |<br />
quired to accommodate a growing<br />
population.<br />
<br />
To correct septic tank problems, owners<br />
should be required to take one of the |<br />
following actions: construction of new -<br />
septic tank drainage fields; installation |<br />
of limited service community disposal |<br />
systems; tapping into existing public |<br />
facilities. The method selected would |<br />
depend on individual circumstances, the<br />
location of the property, and water |<br />
quality requirements.<br />
<br />
\<br />
<br />
\<br />
<br />
If water use continues to rise at its<br />
<br />
present rate, additional sources will be<br />
needed after the year 2000. These might<br />
<br />
be an increase in the already existing |<br />
Susquehanna River supply, development ‘<br />
of a new source on the Potomac River,<br />
recycling of used water, distillation, and<br />
other measures which are being cur-<br />
rently investigated. -~<br />

GENERAL DESCRIPTION.<br /><br />
TOPOGRAPHY.<br /><br />
—0-05 Q00—<br /><br />
OUNDARTES. — The State of Maryland lies be-<br />
tween 87° 53’ and 39° 43’ 18"" North Latitude,<br />
and Longitude 1° 58’ East, and 2° 30’ West from the<br />
Capitol at Washington, being bounded on the north<br />
by the State of Pennsylvania, on the east by Dela-<br />
ware and the Atlantic Ocean, south and south-west<br />
by Virginia, and south-west and west by West Vir-<br />
ginia. The State’s outlines are more particularly de-<br />
scribed as follows: the famous Mason’s and Dixon’s<br />
line bounds on the east and north, and begins at<br />
Cape Henlopen, the most eastern point of the At-<br />
lantic coast (in Latitude 38° 274’ North, being about<br />
twenty-three miles south of the point now called Cape<br />
Henlopen), and running due west to a point midway<br />
between the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay;<br />
thence by a line northerly (being 31° west of north),<br />
tangent to a circle of twelve miles around the Court-<br />
House at New Castle, Delaware ; thence from the<br />
tangent point northerly, bounding on the circumfer-<br />
ence of the circle until it intersects a line run due<br />
north from said tangent point; and thence with this<br />
due north line till it intersects a line run due west<br />
from a point fifteen miles south from the city of<br />
Philadelphia, as originally laid out. Thence with<br />
this due west line (this is the line more particularly<br />
styled Mason’s and Dixon’s line), to intersect a line<br />
run due north from the farthest source of the Poto-<br />
mac river. This last due north line, as always held in<br />
possession by the States of Virginia and Maryland,<br />
and lately finally accepted as the line, is not run from<br />
the farthest source, but from the Fairfax stone at the<br />
head of the northern or shorter branch of* the Poto-<br />
mac. Thence due south to the Fairfax stone, and<br />
thence by the south bank of the Potomac river to<br />
Smith’s Point on the Chesapeake Bay (at the light-<br />
house). From thence easterly to the most western<br />
point of Watkin’s Point, on the eastern shore of the<br />
Chesapeake. From this point the line should run<br />
due east to the Ocean, but has lately been settled as<br />
bounding on the north shore of Pocomoke Sound<br />
and river, to the old line as found marked, and as<br />
generally accepted in the neighborhood by titles<br />
and otherwise, and thence on this old line to the<br />
Atlantic. From this last point the State fronts on<br />
the Atlantic Ocean northerly to the place of begin-<br />
ning, enclosing an area of 10,979 square miles,<br />
of which the Chesapeake Bay covers about 985<br />
square miles, and other navigable waters about 1,000<br />
miles.<br /><br />
The stone at the northeast corner of Maryland<br />
having been remcved, in 1849 a revision of the<br />
survey made by Mason and Dixon was determined<br />
upon.<br /><br />
"" Commissioners were appointed by the States of<br />
Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, who, with<br />
the aid of Colonel James D. Graham, verified in all<br />
important points the work of their predecessors. A<br />
slight change was made which increased by one<br />
acre and eighty-seven one-hundredths the area of<br />
Maryland.<br /><br />
FACE OF THE COUNTRY.— The surface on<br />
both shores of Chesapeake Bay is level, and the soil<br />
generally sandy. A range of hills enters the State<br />
near the Susquehanna, and extends in a southwesterly<br />
direction to the Potomac river, which it intersects<br /><br />
about ten miles above Washington city. This ridge<br />
2<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
divides the alluvial or tide-water district from the<br />
mountainous part of the State.<br /><br />
The tide-water district embraces nearly one-half<br />
of the territory of the State, the surface being nearly<br />
level, except in the northern part, and but slightly<br />
elevated above the sea, and it is supposed to have<br />
formed the bed of an ancient ocean. Beds of<br />
marl, shell lime, and green sand abound, making<br />
its soil highly productive, when properly cultivated.<br />
The Atlantic coast of the ¢ Eastern Shore” has no<br />
harbors, and is bordered throughout by a sandy<br />
beach, from a few yards to more than a fourth of a<br />
mile in breadth, enclosing a shallow lagoon, which,<br />
owing to the blocking up of several passages by<br />
which it formerly communicated with the sea, may<br />
almost be considered an inland lake. The surface of<br />
the eastern shore which forms part of the peninsula<br />
lying between the Chesapeake and Delaware bays is<br />
low and level, except in the northern part, where it<br />
is somewhat broken and hilly.<br /><br />
In the northern part of Worcester County and<br />
extending across into Delaware, is a high table-land<br />
known as the ¢ Cypress Swamp,” far the most ex-<br />
tensive of the swamps of the State, having an area<br />
of about 50,000 acres. The mountainous district<br />
occupies the strip of territory (not more than four<br />
miles wide in its narrowest part) in the north-west<br />
part of the State, between the Pennsylvania line and<br />
the Potomac river. It is crossed by different ridges<br />
of the Alleghany Mountains, bearing different local<br />
names, such as South-east Mountain, Sugar Loaf<br />
Mountain, Catoctin, Blue Ridge, Kittatinny, Rugged<br />
Mountain, ete., none of which are of great elevation.<br />
This district, which embraces the counties of Car-<br />
roll, Frederick, Washington, Alleghany, and Gar-<br />
rett&lt;(proposed), so far from being wild and uninhab-<br />
itable, containg some of the finest roads and most<br />
desirable farms in the State, much of the region<br />
being characterized by hills of moderate height,<br />
whose rounded summits are covered with verdure,<br />
and the streams that intersect them have generally<br />
abrupt banks, with small tracts of alluvial soil. One<br />
of the finest valleys is the one known in Pennsylva-<br />
nia as the “Cumberland Valley,” in Maryland as<br />
the ¢ Iagerstown Valley,” and in Virginia as the<br />
“Shenandoah Valley.” Tt has a rolling surface and<br />
fertile soil resting upon ¢ Trenton limestone,” which<br />
is remarkable as containing all the great caverns in<br />
the country. Westward of this valley is a belt from<br />
thirty to sixty miles wide of ridges of moderate<br />
height, with their included valleys, and the Alle-<br />
ghany ranges are reached in the county of that name.<br />
The mountains cross the State in long, parallel ridges,<br />
frequently some distance apart, and interspersed with<br />
broad level valleys, called ¢ glades,” which are nat-<br />
ural meadows, for miles as flat as tide-water marshes,<br />
and are covered with natural grass, without timber<br />
or trees of any sort. The surface of the country<br />
in this part of the State is generally rugged and<br />
broken, and much of it is still covered with the native<br />
forest.<br /><br />
RIVERS, BAYS, ETC. — The Potomac, which<br />
constitutes the boundary between Maryland and Vir-<br />
ginia, is formed by the north and south branches,<br />
which unite about 20 miles south-east of Cumber-<br />
land. It flows first north-east to Ilancock, passing<br />
through several ridges of mountains, then pursues a<br />
south-east direction, and receives from the right its<br />
largest affluent, the Shenandoah, just before its pas-<br /><br /><br /><br />
sage through the Blue Ridge at Harper’s Ferry.<br />
Flowing thence south-east to within fourteen miles<br />
above Georgetown, it falls over the edge of the primi-<br />
tive formation in one of the most interesting cataracts<br />
in the U. States. The descent is about eighty feet<br />
in one and a half miles, from thirty to forty feet of<br />
which are in one perpendicular pitch. For some<br />
fifty miles below Georgetown the general course of<br />
the river is south and south-west, after which it re-<br />
sumes its general south-easterly course, expanding<br />
into an estuary some six or cight miles in width, and<br />
empties into the Chesapeake Bay in about 88° North<br />
Latitude, and 76° 10’ West Longitude. The entire<br />
length of the Potomac is about three hundred and<br />
fifty miles. The tide ascends to Georgetown, in the<br />
District of Columbia, about one hundred and twenty<br />
miles from the mouth of the river, which is navi-<br />
gable for the largest vessels to Washington city.<br /><br />
Most of the streams flowing into the Potomac on<br />
the Maryland side are small. Wicomico River and<br />
Mattawoman Creek, in Charles Co., Anacostia River<br />
and Rock Creek, near Washington, the Monocacy<br />
River, in Frederick Co., and the Antietam River and<br />
Licking Creek, in Washington Co., are the principal<br />
ones.<br /><br />
The Susquehanna river enters the State from<br />
Pennsylvania near the north-east corner, and, flow-<br />
ing in a south-easterly direction for fifteen miles,<br />
empties into Chesapeake Bay at Havre-de-Grace.<br />
The main stream is about one hundred and fifty<br />
miles long, and has very unequal breadth, at some<br />
places exceeding a mile, and at others less than one-<br />
fourth of a mile. It is adorned by numerous beau-<br />
tiful islands, and the channel is frequently obstructed<br />
by rocky rapids, which prevent navigation in low<br />
stages of water.<br /><br />
The Patuxent is the longest river, lying entirely<br />
in Maryland. It rises about eighteen miles east of<br />
Frederick city. Flowing in a south-easterly direction,<br />
it forms the boundary between Montgomery, Prince<br />
George’s, and Saint Mary’s counties on the right,<br />
and Howard, Anne Arundel, and Calvert counties<br />
on the left, and empties by an estuary two or three<br />
miles wide into Chesapeake Bay. The valley of this<br />
river is about ninety miles long, and is remarkably<br />
narrow. Small vessels ascend forty or fifty miles<br />
from its month.<br /><br />
The entire waters of the State of Maryland flow<br />
into Chesapeake Bay, except a few small streams in<br />
the eastern part of Worcester County, which flow<br />
into Sinepuxent and Chincoteague bays, and the<br />
Youghiogheny river and branches, which empty into<br />
the Monongahela and Ohio rivers.<br /><br />
Chesapeake, the largest bay in the United States,<br />
enters Virginia between Cape Charles and Cape<br />
Henry, in about Latitude 87° N., and Longitude<br />
76° W., and extends into Maryland as far as 89°<br />
86"" N. Latitude, and 76° 8’ W. Longitude. The<br />
length is about two hundred miles, and the breadth<br />
from four to forty miles. The distance from Cape<br />
Charles to Cape Henry is about twelve miles,<br /><br />
Chesapeake Bay is remarkable for the extreme<br />
irregularity of its coast-line, —numerous bays and<br />
estuaries are on either side, some of which serve as<br />
outlets or reservoirs to the waters of the different<br />
rivers of Maryland and Virginia, while others are<br />
scarcely fed by any permanent stream, being nothing<br />
more than mere arms or projections from the sea.<br />
The depth of the bay is sufficient for the largest ships<br />
to ascend nearly to the mouth of the Susquehanna.<br /><br />

GENERAL DESCRIPTION.<br />

TOPOGRAPHY.<br />
<br />
—0-05 Q00—<br />
<br />
OUNDARTES. — The State of Maryland lies be-<br />
tween 87° 53’ and 39° 43’ 18"" North Latitude,<br />
and Longitude 1° 58’ East, and 2° 30’ West from the<br />
Capitol at Washington, being bounded on the north<br />
by the State of Pennsylvania, on the east by Dela-<br />
ware and the Atlantic Ocean, south and south-west<br />
by Virginia, and south-west and west by West Vir-<br />
ginia. The State’s outlines are more particularly de-<br />
scribed as follows: the famous Mason’s and Dixon’s<br />
line bounds on the east and north, and begins at<br />
Cape Henlopen, the most eastern point of the At-<br />
lantic coast (in Latitude 38° 274’ North, being about<br />
twenty-three miles south of the point now called Cape<br />
Henlopen), and running due west to a point midway<br />
between the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay;<br />
thence by a line northerly (being 31° west of north),<br />
tangent to a circle of twelve miles around the Court-<br />
House at New Castle, Delaware ; thence from the<br />
tangent point northerly, bounding on the circumfer-<br />
ence of the circle until it intersects a line run due<br />
north from said tangent point; and thence with this<br />
due north line till it intersects a line run due west<br />
from a point fifteen miles south from the city of<br />
Philadelphia, as originally laid out. Thence with<br />
this due west line (this is the line more particularly<br />
styled Mason’s and Dixon’s line), to intersect a line<br />
run due north from the farthest source of the Poto-<br />
mac river. This last due north line, as always held in<br />
possession by the States of Virginia and Maryland,<br />
and lately finally accepted as the line, is not run from<br />
the farthest source, but from the Fairfax stone at the<br />
head of the northern or shorter branch of* the Poto-<br />
mac. Thence due south to the Fairfax stone, and<br />
thence by the south bank of the Potomac river to<br />
Smith’s Point on the Chesapeake Bay (at the light-<br />
house). From thence easterly to the most western<br />
point of Watkin’s Point, on the eastern shore of the<br />
Chesapeake. From this point the line should run<br />
due east to the Ocean, but has lately been settled as<br />
bounding on the north shore of Pocomoke Sound<br />
and river, to the old line as found marked, and as<br />
generally accepted in the neighborhood by titles<br />
and otherwise, and thence on this old line to the<br />
Atlantic. From this last point the State fronts on<br />
the Atlantic Ocean northerly to the place of begin-<br />
ning, enclosing an area of 10,979 square miles,<br />
of which the Chesapeake Bay covers about 985<br />
square miles, and other navigable waters about 1,000<br />
miles.<br />
<br />
The stone at the northeast corner of Maryland<br />
having been remcved, in 1849 a revision of the<br />
survey made by Mason and Dixon was determined<br />
upon.<br />
<br />
"" Commissioners were appointed by the States of<br />
Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, who, with<br />
the aid of Colonel James D. Graham, verified in all<br />
important points the work of their predecessors. A<br />
slight change was made which increased by one<br />
acre and eighty-seven one-hundredths the area of<br />
Maryland.<br />
<br />
FACE OF THE COUNTRY.— The surface on<br />
both shores of Chesapeake Bay is level, and the soil<br />
generally sandy. A range of hills enters the State<br />
near the Susquehanna, and extends in a southwesterly<br />
direction to the Potomac river, which it intersects<br />
<br />
about ten miles above Washington city. This ridge<br />
2<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
divides the alluvial or tide-water district from the<br />
mountainous part of the State.<br />
<br />
The tide-water district embraces nearly one-half<br />
of the territory of the State, the surface being nearly<br />
level, except in the northern part, and but slightly<br />
elevated above the sea, and it is supposed to have<br />
formed the bed of an ancient ocean. Beds of<br />
marl, shell lime, and green sand abound, making<br />
its soil highly productive, when properly cultivated.<br />
The Atlantic coast of the ¢ Eastern Shore” has no<br />
harbors, and is bordered throughout by a sandy<br />
beach, from a few yards to more than a fourth of a<br />
mile in breadth, enclosing a shallow lagoon, which,<br />
owing to the blocking up of several passages by<br />
which it formerly communicated with the sea, may<br />
almost be considered an inland lake. The surface of<br />
the eastern shore which forms part of the peninsula<br />
lying between the Chesapeake and Delaware bays is<br />
low and level, except in the northern part, where it<br />
is somewhat broken and hilly.<br />
<br />
In the northern part of Worcester County and<br />
extending across into Delaware, is a high table-land<br />
known as the ¢ Cypress Swamp,” far the most ex-<br />
tensive of the swamps of the State, having an area<br />
of about 50,000 acres. The mountainous district<br />
occupies the strip of territory (not more than four<br />
miles wide in its narrowest part) in the north-west<br />
part of the State, between the Pennsylvania line and<br />
the Potomac river. It is crossed by different ridges<br />
of the Alleghany Mountains, bearing different local<br />
names, such as South-east Mountain, Sugar Loaf<br />
Mountain, Catoctin, Blue Ridge, Kittatinny, Rugged<br />
Mountain, ete., none of which are of great elevation.<br />
This district, which embraces the counties of Car-<br />
roll, Frederick, Washington, Alleghany, and Gar-<br />
rett<(proposed), so far from being wild and uninhab-<br />
itable, containg some of the finest roads and most<br />
desirable farms in the State, much of the region<br />
being characterized by hills of moderate height,<br />
whose rounded summits are covered with verdure,<br />
and the streams that intersect them have generally<br />
abrupt banks, with small tracts of alluvial soil. One<br />
of the finest valleys is the one known in Pennsylva-<br />
nia as the “Cumberland Valley,” in Maryland as<br />
the ¢ Iagerstown Valley,” and in Virginia as the<br />
“Shenandoah Valley.” Tt has a rolling surface and<br />
fertile soil resting upon ¢ Trenton limestone,” which<br />
is remarkable as containing all the great caverns in<br />
the country. Westward of this valley is a belt from<br />
thirty to sixty miles wide of ridges of moderate<br />
height, with their included valleys, and the Alle-<br />
ghany ranges are reached in the county of that name.<br />
The mountains cross the State in long, parallel ridges,<br />
frequently some distance apart, and interspersed with<br />
broad level valleys, called ¢ glades,” which are nat-<br />
ural meadows, for miles as flat as tide-water marshes,<br />
and are covered with natural grass, without timber<br />
or trees of any sort. The surface of the country<br />
in this part of the State is generally rugged and<br />
broken, and much of it is still covered with the native<br />
forest.<br />
<br />
RIVERS, BAYS, ETC. — The Potomac, which<br />
constitutes the boundary between Maryland and Vir-<br />
ginia, is formed by the north and south branches,<br />
which unite about 20 miles south-east of Cumber-<br />
land. It flows first north-east to Ilancock, passing<br />
through several ridges of mountains, then pursues a<br />
south-east direction, and receives from the right its<br />
largest affluent, the Shenandoah, just before its pas-<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
sage through the Blue Ridge at Harper’s Ferry.<br />
Flowing thence south-east to within fourteen miles<br />
above Georgetown, it falls over the edge of the primi-<br />
tive formation in one of the most interesting cataracts<br />
in the U. States. The descent is about eighty feet<br />
in one and a half miles, from thirty to forty feet of<br />
which are in one perpendicular pitch. For some<br />
fifty miles below Georgetown the general course of<br />
the river is south and south-west, after which it re-<br />
sumes its general south-easterly course, expanding<br />
into an estuary some six or cight miles in width, and<br />
empties into the Chesapeake Bay in about 88° North<br />
Latitude, and 76° 10’ West Longitude. The entire<br />
length of the Potomac is about three hundred and<br />
fifty miles. The tide ascends to Georgetown, in the<br />
District of Columbia, about one hundred and twenty<br />
miles from the mouth of the river, which is navi-<br />
gable for the largest vessels to Washington city.<br />
<br />
Most of the streams flowing into the Potomac on<br />
the Maryland side are small. Wicomico River and<br />
Mattawoman Creek, in Charles Co., Anacostia River<br />
and Rock Creek, near Washington, the Monocacy<br />
River, in Frederick Co., and the Antietam River and<br />
Licking Creek, in Washington Co., are the principal<br />
ones.<br />
<br />
The Susquehanna river enters the State from<br />
Pennsylvania near the north-east corner, and, flow-<br />
ing in a south-easterly direction for fifteen miles,<br />
empties into Chesapeake Bay at Havre-de-Grace.<br />
The main stream is about one hundred and fifty<br />
miles long, and has very unequal breadth, at some<br />
places exceeding a mile, and at others less than one-<br />
fourth of a mile. It is adorned by numerous beau-<br />
tiful islands, and the channel is frequently obstructed<br />
by rocky rapids, which prevent navigation in low<br />
stages of water.<br />
<br />
The Patuxent is the longest river, lying entirely<br />
in Maryland. It rises about eighteen miles east of<br />
Frederick city. Flowing in a south-easterly direction,<br />
it forms the boundary between Montgomery, Prince<br />
George’s, and Saint Mary’s counties on the right,<br />
and Howard, Anne Arundel, and Calvert counties<br />
on the left, and empties by an estuary two or three<br />
miles wide into Chesapeake Bay. The valley of this<br />
river is about ninety miles long, and is remarkably<br />
narrow. Small vessels ascend forty or fifty miles<br />
from its month.<br />
<br />
The entire waters of the State of Maryland flow<br />
into Chesapeake Bay, except a few small streams in<br />
the eastern part of Worcester County, which flow<br />
into Sinepuxent and Chincoteague bays, and the<br />
Youghiogheny river and branches, which empty into<br />
the Monongahela and Ohio rivers.<br />
<br />
Chesapeake, the largest bay in the United States,<br />
enters Virginia between Cape Charles and Cape<br />
Henry, in about Latitude 87° N., and Longitude<br />
76° W., and extends into Maryland as far as 89°<br />
86"" N. Latitude, and 76° 8’ W. Longitude. The<br />
length is about two hundred miles, and the breadth<br />
from four to forty miles. The distance from Cape<br />
Charles to Cape Henry is about twelve miles,<br />
<br />
Chesapeake Bay is remarkable for the extreme<br />
irregularity of its coast-line, —numerous bays and<br />
estuaries are on either side, some of which serve as<br />
outlets or reservoirs to the waters of the different<br />
rivers of Maryland and Virginia, while others are<br />
scarcely fed by any permanent stream, being nothing<br />
more than mere arms or projections from the sea.<br />
The depth of the bay is sufficient for the largest ships<br />
to ascend nearly to the mouth of the Susquehanna.<br />

* New county of GarrrrT, proposed to be formed from the<br />
western part of Alleghany.<br />
+ New county from Somerset and Worcester in 1867.<br /><br />
ALLEGHANY COUNTY * occupies the extreme<br />
western end of the State, and is bounded on the<br />
north by Pennsylvania, east by Washington County,<br />
south by the north branch of the Potomac river to<br />
its source at the Fairfax stone, and on the west by a<br />
line run due north from the Fairfax stone to the<br />
Pennsylvania line. The two last-named outlines<br />
separate it from the State of West Virginia.<br /><br />
This county is crossed by the ranges of the Alle-<br />
ghany Mountains, from which it takesits name. The<br />
geology is composed principally of sandstone and<br />
limestone, with quartz and slate. The most valuable<br />
minerals are the vast coal-fields and iron-ore beds.<br />
The soil is of varying character of sand and clay, in<br />
some parts quite fertile, though mostly uncultivated,<br />
and covered with natural forests. The waters of the<br />
county are the North Branch of the Potomac, and<br />
Savage River, and George’s, Will’s Town, and Fif-<br />
teen Mile creeks, with many tributaries heading in<br />
the mountains, and all flowing into the Potomac.<br />
The western portion of the county is drained by the<br />
Big and Little Youghiogheny rivers (commonly called<br />
Big and Little Yough), with their numerous small<br />
creeks and branches, which empty into the Monon-<br />
gahela and Ohio rivers.<br /><br />
The surface of Alleghany is broken and irregular,<br />
the greater part being on the mountains, and covered<br />
with the original forests of fine timbers, whilst be-<br />
tween the mountain ridges are many broad and level<br />
valleys known as ¢ The Glades,” which have in most<br />
cases a rich deep soil, and are covered with excellent<br />
grasses, forming naturally very fine grazing lands,<br />
and yielding large crops of hay. These lands also<br />
make good farms, producing all kinds of grain and<br />
fine fruit.<br /><br />
Alleghany possesses, in its immense coal-fields, the<br />
most valuable mineral deposits in the State, being<br />
superior, in fact, to gold mines. There are three<br />
large coal-fields: one in the Youghiogheny Valley,<br />
another along Meadow Mountain, neither of which is<br />
used except for local purposes, having no outlet to a<br />
market. The third is the “Great George’s Creek”<br />
and Cumberland coal-field. This region, since the<br />
construction of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and<br />
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, has been largely<br />
developed. The George’s Creek, now Cumberland<br />
and Pennsylvania Railroad, extends from Western-<br />
port, on the Potomac, and the Baltimore and Ohio<br /><br />
*If adopted by the people at the November election of 1872, the<br />
county of Alleghany will be divided, and the western portion will<br />
be formed into a new county, and called ¢ Garrett.”<br /><br />
The line of division commences on the north branch of the Po-<br />
tomac, at the mouth of Savage River, and runs in a north-easterly<br />
direction to the summit of Savage Mountain, on the Pennsylvania<br />
line.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Railroad, up George’s Creck, and tunnelling the ridge<br />
at Frostburg, then descends the sides of the moun-<br />
tains by Mt. Savage to Cumberland. The Cumber-<br />
land Coal and Iron Company’s Railroad also connects<br />
their mines with Cumberland. These two roads,<br />
running directly from the mines, transport the coal<br />
and deliver it to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,<br />
and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which bring it to<br />
the markets at Georgetown and Alexandria on the<br />
Potomac, and to Baltimore. The products of these<br />
mines have increased from a few thousand tons,<br />
twelve or fifteen years back, to an annual delivery<br />
ofnearly 1,000,000 tons with the present facilities, tax-<br />
ing the capacity of the two great sources of outlet,<br />
one of which, the canal, is generally closed four or<br />
five months in the year.<br /><br />
The coal produced is bituminous, burns very easily<br />
and to a very light ash, having no slag or clinker. It<br />
is excellent for blacksmithing, and unexcelled for<br />
manufacturing purposes generally, being the very<br />
best fuel for generating steam. The demand for<br />
this coal is always equal to or beyond the supply,<br />
whilst the extent of coal in this one field alone is<br />
such, that it is estimated it would yield its present<br />
annual supply for 4,000 years. :<br /><br />
This county has also large supplies of iron ores,<br />
which are smelted in several large furnaces, many<br />
undeveloped beds being a very fine description of<br />
ore. Also, excellent building material of limestone<br />
and sandstone, and large quantities of hydraulic ce-<br />
ment, which is obtained very near to and prepared<br />
for market at Cumberland. Fire-brick clay of a<br />
very superior quality is found and manufactured in<br />
immense quantities at Mt. Savage Works. This<br />
county has great and almost innumerable water-<br />
powers, comparatively little used, having only some<br />
few grist and saw mills (mostly the latter) for local<br />
uses only.<br /><br />
This county has good transportation by the rail-<br />
road and canal before named, and also a turnpike<br />
running easterly; and the Great National Road<br />
(turnpike), which was built by the United States<br />
Government to Indianapolis, runs westerly from<br />
Cumberland.<br /><br />
Cumberland, the county-seat, is situated around a<br />
great bend in the Potomac river, and sustained prin-<br />
cipally by the operations of the coal trade, by the<br />
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the Chesapeake<br />
and Ohio Canal which terminates here.<br /><br />
ANNE ARUNDEL is the most centrally situated<br />
county of the State, and is bounded on the east by<br />
the Chesapeake Bay, south by Calvert County, west<br />
by the Patuxent river and Prince George’s County,<br />
northwest by Howard County, and north by Balti-<br />
more County. At its northern extremity it lies<br />
immediately opposite to and is connected with<br />
Baltimore city by a draw-bridge about a mile long.<br />
Iron ore abounds in the northern part of Anne<br />
Arundel.<br /><br />
This county is of a rolling character, but has no<br />
very elevated points, and, like most of the other coun-<br />
ties, has all descriptions of soil. Below Annapolis<br />
there is generally a stiffer soil, and mostly an excellent<br />
fertile country, and very productive in tobacco and<br />
grain. The country between Annapolis and Balti-<br />
more is almost entirely cultivated in truck gardens,<br />
and sends to the Baltimore markets a large propor-<br />
tion of their finest supplies, producing immense<br />
quantities of strawberries, peas, cucumbers, toma-<br />
toes, cantaloupes, water-melons, cabbages, &amp;c. This<br />
section is highly adapted for this purpose, being<br />
mostly a light soil, easily tilled, and, being protected<br />
by the elevated lands north of Baltimore, is several<br />
days earlier in ripening crops than the soils around<br />
the north of the city. The timbers are principally<br />
oaks, chestnut, and pines. There are some fisheries<br />
in the county though not very extensive, but oysters<br />
abound around all the shores south from Sandy<br />
Point, and also wild fowl in the season.<br /><br />
Annapolis city is the county-seat, the capital of<br /><br /><br /><br />
Maryland, and the oldest city in the State, dating its<br />
origin from the early days of the colony. It was,<br />
until the Revolution, the largest city, and also pub-<br />
lished the only newspaper in the State for the first<br />
forty or fifty years of its existence. The United<br />
States Naval Academy having been located here<br />
some years back, the city took quite a start, and be-<br />
came quite renewed in appearance, and also increased<br />
in population from 38,011 in 1850 to 4,529 in 1860,<br />
and 5,744 in 1870. The city is pleasantly situated<br />
near the mouth of the Severn river, which is navi-<br />
gable for large vessels several miles farther up.<br /><br />
BALTIMORE COUNTY is the most central of<br />
the northern tier of counties, and one of the largest<br />
in the State, being bounded on the north by Penn-<br />
sylvania, east by Harford County, west by Carroll<br />
County, and southwest and south by the Patapsco<br />
Falls and River, separating it from Howard and<br />
Anne Arundel counties. This county, from its po-<br />
sition surrounding the metropolis, is the most im-<br />
portant in the State. The surface is uneven and<br />
varied, and the rivers and falls which traverse it<br />
afford immense water-powers, and are the sites of<br />
the most extensive milling operations in the Union.<br />
The Little and Great Gunpowder Falls, Patapsco<br />
River, and Gwynn’s and Jones’s Falls are improved<br />
with large carpet, cotton and woollen factories, fur-<br />
naces, foundries, paper and flouring mills, all doing<br />
a large and flourishing business. The finest and<br />
strongest cotton duck and the best flour are here<br />
manufactured. In many parts fruits are extensively<br />
cultivated, and the vicinity of Baltimore is remark-<br />
able for the fine quality and profusion of its garden<br />
vegetables.<br /><br />
Iron ores of the brown hematite order, magnetic<br />
oxide, and carbonate species are found in many parts<br />
of the county, and smelted in several furnaces.<br />
Copper mines are worked at Bare Hills, about seven<br />
miles north of Baltimore; and near Bare Hills, and<br />
southwest from Reisterstown, are very extensive beds<br />
of chrome ore, yiclding a large proportion of that<br />
article produced by our State, which furnishes the<br />
entire supply of chrome used in this country, and<br />
much of that used in Europe.<br /><br />
The large beds of clay in the vicinity of Baltimore<br />
have always been celebrated for producing bricks<br />
unequalled in the country for uniformity of color<br />
and smoothness. This clay is also manufactured<br />
into stone-ware and earthen-ware. Beds of excel-<br />
lent clay for fire-bricks also exist in the same vicinity.<br /><br />
Large quarries of fine building-stone are exten-<br />
sively worked, affording good granite and gneiss, in<br />
the vicinity of Baltimore. In the neighborhood of<br />
Texas and Cockeysville are unlimited quantities of<br />
excellent marble, the fine-grained white species used<br />
for the Capitol extension at Washington, and the<br />
alum marble, well known from its use in the con-<br />
struction of the Patent Office at Washington. Large<br />
quarries of limestone exist in many parts of the<br />
county; a great quantity is burned at Texas. Lime<br />
is abundant in Long Green, Dulany’s, Green Spring,<br />
Worthington, and other valleys, which valleys con-<br />
tain some of the very finest and most productive<br />
lands in the State.<br /><br />
There are some fisheries on the Bay shore, and<br />
some of the best points for shooting wild fowl. The<br />
county is well provided with travelling facilities,<br />
most of the roads leaving the city are turnpikes,<br />
whilst all the railway routes also centre here. The<br />
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, running southwesterly<br />
and westerly; the Western Maryland Railroad, north-<br />
westerly; the Northern Central extends the entire<br />
length of the county in a northern direction, and the<br />
Philadelphia Railroad toward the east. There are<br />
also horse railways running westerly to Catonsville,<br />
and northerly to Towsontown, seven miles from<br />
Baltimore.<br /><br />
CALVERT COUNTY lies on the western shore<br />
of Chesapeake Bay, and is the smallest county in the<br /><br />

* New county of GarrrrT, proposed to be formed from the<br />
western part of Alleghany.<br />
+ New county from Somerset and Worcester in 1867.<br />
<br />
ALLEGHANY COUNTY * occupies the extreme<br />
western end of the State, and is bounded on the<br />
north by Pennsylvania, east by Washington County,<br />
south by the north branch of the Potomac river to<br />
its source at the Fairfax stone, and on the west by a<br />
line run due north from the Fairfax stone to the<br />
Pennsylvania line. The two last-named outlines<br />
separate it from the State of West Virginia.<br />
<br />
This county is crossed by the ranges of the Alle-<br />
ghany Mountains, from which it takesits name. The<br />
geology is composed principally of sandstone and<br />
limestone, with quartz and slate. The most valuable<br />
minerals are the vast coal-fields and iron-ore beds.<br />
The soil is of varying character of sand and clay, in<br />
some parts quite fertile, though mostly uncultivated,<br />
and covered with natural forests. The waters of the<br />
county are the North Branch of the Potomac, and<br />
Savage River, and George’s, Will’s Town, and Fif-<br />
teen Mile creeks, with many tributaries heading in<br />
the mountains, and all flowing into the Potomac.<br />
The western portion of the county is drained by the<br />
Big and Little Youghiogheny rivers (commonly called<br />
Big and Little Yough), with their numerous small<br />
creeks and branches, which empty into the Monon-<br />
gahela and Ohio rivers.<br />
<br />
The surface of Alleghany is broken and irregular,<br />
the greater part being on the mountains, and covered<br />
with the original forests of fine timbers, whilst be-<br />
tween the mountain ridges are many broad and level<br />
valleys known as ¢ The Glades,” which have in most<br />
cases a rich deep soil, and are covered with excellent<br />
grasses, forming naturally very fine grazing lands,<br />
and yielding large crops of hay. These lands also<br />
make good farms, producing all kinds of grain and<br />
fine fruit.<br />
<br />
Alleghany possesses, in its immense coal-fields, the<br />
most valuable mineral deposits in the State, being<br />
superior, in fact, to gold mines. There are three<br />
large coal-fields: one in the Youghiogheny Valley,<br />
another along Meadow Mountain, neither of which is<br />
used except for local purposes, having no outlet to a<br />
market. The third is the “Great George’s Creek”<br />
and Cumberland coal-field. This region, since the<br />
construction of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and<br />
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, has been largely<br />
developed. The George’s Creek, now Cumberland<br />
and Pennsylvania Railroad, extends from Western-<br />
port, on the Potomac, and the Baltimore and Ohio<br />
<br />
*If adopted by the people at the November election of 1872, the<br />
county of Alleghany will be divided, and the western portion will<br />
be formed into a new county, and called ¢ Garrett.”<br />
<br />
The line of division commences on the north branch of the Po-<br />
tomac, at the mouth of Savage River, and runs in a north-easterly<br />
direction to the summit of Savage Mountain, on the Pennsylvania<br />
line.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Railroad, up George’s Creck, and tunnelling the ridge<br />
at Frostburg, then descends the sides of the moun-<br />
tains by Mt. Savage to Cumberland. The Cumber-<br />
land Coal and Iron Company’s Railroad also connects<br />
their mines with Cumberland. These two roads,<br />
running directly from the mines, transport the coal<br />
and deliver it to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,<br />
and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which bring it to<br />
the markets at Georgetown and Alexandria on the<br />
Potomac, and to Baltimore. The products of these<br />
mines have increased from a few thousand tons,<br />
twelve or fifteen years back, to an annual delivery<br />
ofnearly 1,000,000 tons with the present facilities, tax-<br />
ing the capacity of the two great sources of outlet,<br />
one of which, the canal, is generally closed four or<br />
five months in the year.<br />
<br />
The coal produced is bituminous, burns very easily<br />
and to a very light ash, having no slag or clinker. It<br />
is excellent for blacksmithing, and unexcelled for<br />
manufacturing purposes generally, being the very<br />
best fuel for generating steam. The demand for<br />
this coal is always equal to or beyond the supply,<br />
whilst the extent of coal in this one field alone is<br />
such, that it is estimated it would yield its present<br />
annual supply for 4,000 years. :<br />
<br />
This county has also large supplies of iron ores,<br />
which are smelted in several large furnaces, many<br />
undeveloped beds being a very fine description of<br />
ore. Also, excellent building material of limestone<br />
and sandstone, and large quantities of hydraulic ce-<br />
ment, which is obtained very near to and prepared<br />
for market at Cumberland. Fire-brick clay of a<br />
very superior quality is found and manufactured in<br />
immense quantities at Mt. Savage Works. This<br />
county has great and almost innumerable water-<br />
powers, comparatively little used, having only some<br />
few grist and saw mills (mostly the latter) for local<br />
uses only.<br />
<br />
This county has good transportation by the rail-<br />
road and canal before named, and also a turnpike<br />
running easterly; and the Great National Road<br />
(turnpike), which was built by the United States<br />
Government to Indianapolis, runs westerly from<br />
Cumberland.<br />
<br />
Cumberland, the county-seat, is situated around a<br />
great bend in the Potomac river, and sustained prin-<br />
cipally by the operations of the coal trade, by the<br />
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the Chesapeake<br />
and Ohio Canal which terminates here.<br />
<br />
ANNE ARUNDEL is the most centrally situated<br />
county of the State, and is bounded on the east by<br />
the Chesapeake Bay, south by Calvert County, west<br />
by the Patuxent river and Prince George’s County,<br />
northwest by Howard County, and north by Balti-<br />
more County. At its northern extremity it lies<br />
immediately opposite to and is connected with<br />
Baltimore city by a draw-bridge about a mile long.<br />
Iron ore abounds in the northern part of Anne<br />
Arundel.<br />
<br />
This county is of a rolling character, but has no<br />
very elevated points, and, like most of the other coun-<br />
ties, has all descriptions of soil. Below Annapolis<br />
there is generally a stiffer soil, and mostly an excellent<br />
fertile country, and very productive in tobacco and<br />
grain. The country between Annapolis and Balti-<br />
more is almost entirely cultivated in truck gardens,<br />
and sends to the Baltimore markets a large propor-<br />
tion of their finest supplies, producing immense<br />
quantities of strawberries, peas, cucumbers, toma-<br />
toes, cantaloupes, water-melons, cabbages, &c. This<br />
section is highly adapted for this purpose, being<br />
mostly a light soil, easily tilled, and, being protected<br />
by the elevated lands north of Baltimore, is several<br />
days earlier in ripening crops than the soils around<br />
the north of the city. The timbers are principally<br />
oaks, chestnut, and pines. There are some fisheries<br />
in the county though not very extensive, but oysters<br />
abound around all the shores south from Sandy<br />
Point, and also wild fowl in the season.<br />
<br />
Annapolis city is the county-seat, the capital of<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Maryland, and the oldest city in the State, dating its<br />
origin from the early days of the colony. It was,<br />
until the Revolution, the largest city, and also pub-<br />
lished the only newspaper in the State for the first<br />
forty or fifty years of its existence. The United<br />
States Naval Academy having been located here<br />
some years back, the city took quite a start, and be-<br />
came quite renewed in appearance, and also increased<br />
in population from 38,011 in 1850 to 4,529 in 1860,<br />
and 5,744 in 1870. The city is pleasantly situated<br />
near the mouth of the Severn river, which is navi-<br />
gable for large vessels several miles farther up.<br />
<br />
BALTIMORE COUNTY is the most central of<br />
the northern tier of counties, and one of the largest<br />
in the State, being bounded on the north by Penn-<br />
sylvania, east by Harford County, west by Carroll<br />
County, and southwest and south by the Patapsco<br />
Falls and River, separating it from Howard and<br />
Anne Arundel counties. This county, from its po-<br />
sition surrounding the metropolis, is the most im-<br />
portant in the State. The surface is uneven and<br />
varied, and the rivers and falls which traverse it<br />
afford immense water-powers, and are the sites of<br />
the most extensive milling operations in the Union.<br />
The Little and Great Gunpowder Falls, Patapsco<br />
River, and Gwynn’s and Jones’s Falls are improved<br />
with large carpet, cotton and woollen factories, fur-<br />
naces, foundries, paper and flouring mills, all doing<br />
a large and flourishing business. The finest and<br />
strongest cotton duck and the best flour are here<br />
manufactured. In many parts fruits are extensively<br />
cultivated, and the vicinity of Baltimore is remark-<br />
able for the fine quality and profusion of its garden<br />
vegetables.<br />
<br />
Iron ores of the brown hematite order, magnetic<br />
oxide, and carbonate species are found in many parts<br />
of the county, and smelted in several furnaces.<br />
Copper mines are worked at Bare Hills, about seven<br />
miles north of Baltimore; and near Bare Hills, and<br />
southwest from Reisterstown, are very extensive beds<br />
of chrome ore, yiclding a large proportion of that<br />

<br />
Large quarries of fine building-stone are exten-<br />
sively worked, affording good granite and gneiss, in<br />
the vicinity of Baltimore. In the neighborhood of<br />
Texas and Cockeysville are unlimited quantities of<br />
excellent marble, the fine-grained white species used<br />
for the Capitol extension at Washington, and the<br />
alum marble, well known from its use in the con-<br />
struction of the Patent Office at Washington. Large<br />
quarries of limestone exist in many parts of the<br />
county; a great quantity is burned at Texas. Lime<br />
is abundant in Long Green, Dulany’s, Green Spring,<br />
Worthington, and other valleys, which valleys con-<br />
tain some of the very finest and most productive<br />
lands in the State.<br />
<br />
There are some fisheries on the Bay shore, and<br />
some of the best points for shooting wild fowl. The<br />
county is well provided with travelling facilities,<br />

GENERAL DESCRIPTION.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
State, being in length about 32 miles, with an aver-<br /><br />
age width of only 7 miles. Itisa peninsula, bounded<br />
by the Bay on the east, the Patuxent River on the<br />
west, and on the north by Anne Arundel County.<br />
The surface is undulating, and drains from a central<br />
elevation towards the bay and river, into which nu-<br />
merous little creeks empty.<br /><br />
The soil is a soft fine mould, except on the Patux-<br />
ent, where it is more clayey, and is well adapted to<br />
the growth of corn, tobacco, and wheat, though the<br />
great staple is tobacco. The climate is generally<br />
warm and mild. The waters of the Chesapeake and<br />
Patuxent abound in the finest fish and oysters; im-<br />
mense quantities of the latter are annually carried to<br />
Baltimore and the Northern markets; the trade em-<br />
ploying large numbers of men. Tripoli, which is<br />
used as a polishing material, is found in many local-<br />
ities, the deposit on the Patuxent being very large.<br />
Marl exists also, affording a good fertilizer in many<br />
localities. Oak, Chestnut, Pine, and Locust are the<br />
natural timber growths, and mostly line the navi-<br />
gable waters.<br /><br />
CAROLINE COUNTY is of small area, and is<br />
bounded on the east by the State of Delaware, north-<br />
west and west by Queen Anne’s and Talbot, and<br />
south’by Dorchester counties.<br /><br />
The main branch of the Choptank River runs<br />
through the county, and is navigated by steamboats<br />
to Denton. This, with other crecks, afford excellent<br />
facilities for sending produce to market, and in re-<br />
turn, obtaining lime, ashes, and manures; scarcely<br />
any land lying more than five miles from navigable<br />
water.<br /><br />
Some of its soils are sandy, some are low meadow-<br />
lands of rich black earth, but the largest proportion<br />
is a loam with a clay subsoil. The last will produce<br />
grains, grasses, vegetables, cotton, and tobacco, which<br />
latter two are raised in small quantities very success-<br />
fully for domestic use. The sandy soil is very pro-<br />
ductive in sweet potatoes, and every variety of vege-<br />
tables and fruits. Peaches are very largely cultivated<br />
and sent to the city markets.<br /><br />
The general character of the county is level, but<br />
sufficiently undulating to afford drainage, and the<br />
roads are mostly level and hard, and give very fine<br />
travelling facilities. Some excellent fisheries of shad<br />
and herring are in the county, and very large quan-<br />
tities of oysters are marketed. Crabs, wild ducks,<br />
and other game are also abundant.<br /><br />
The county-seat is at Denton, a quiet town pleas-<br />
antly situated at the head of steamboat navigation<br />
on the Choptank River. Two other considerable<br />
towns are Greensborough and Hillsborough, both<br />
near the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, which<br />
crosses the upper part of the county.<br /><br />
CARROLL COUNTY is bounded on the north<br />
by Pennsylvania, on the south by Howard County,<br />
on the east by Baltimore County, and on the west by<br />
Frederick County. The surface is mostly undulat-<br /><br />
ing, watered by fine streams, tributaries of the Pa-<br /><br />
tapsco and Monocacy rivers, which flow from innu-<br />
merable springs of the purest water. Kxcellent<br />
water-power is afforded by these streams, which is<br />
improved by cotton and woollen factories, merchant<br />
and paper-mills, and numerous saw and grist-mills.<br />
There are also a considerable number of tanneries,<br />
induced, no doubt, by the abundance of fine oak<br />
timber, which comprises the body of the natural<br />
growth of wood. Parr’s Ridge passes through this<br />
county, and is the first elevated ridge approaching<br />
the Alleghanies. From this ridge the Catoctin<br />
Mountains are plainly visible.<br /><br />
The soils are limestone, “ Red-lands,” and slaty<br /><br />
soil, all mostly very fertile or easily improved, ren-<br /><br />
dering it one of the finest agricultural counties of<br />
Maryland. It has but a small proportion of very<br />
poor or unimproved land.<br /><br />
‘Wheat, rye, corn, and oats are largely produced,<br />
with some potatoes and buckwheat, and latterly con-<br /><br />
s N A i N il TS<br /><br /><br /><br />
siderable sorghum. Tobacco is still raised to some<br />
extent in the lower part of the county, but is yearly<br /><br />
less cultivated. The grazing is fine, and it ranks as .<br /><br />
a fine dairy county, producing a large share of the<br />
butter crop of the State. The Pipe Creek, Sam’s<br />
Creek, and Wakefield valleys are unexcelled for fer-<br />
tility and fine farming.<br /><br />
The county possesses fine building material, a good<br />
species of granite, and other stone. Marble has been<br />
quarried near Sam’s Creek. Large quantities of lime-<br />
stone are quarried in the western, central, and north-<br />
ern part of the county, and large beds of iron ore<br />
are worked in the vicinity of Westminster and else-<br />
where. A number of copper mines have been<br />
opened, and several are now working, in a line ex-<br />
tending from the Springfield mine near Sykesville,<br />
to the Maryland Company’s mine near Finksburg.<br /><br />
The soapstone quarry near Marriottsville has been<br />
and is still extensively worked, and furnishes the<br />
purest quality of soapstone known. At the manu-<br />
factory in Baltimore, it is sawed and worked into all<br />
imaginable shapes for a great variety of purposes.<br />
The number of uses to which it is applied have of<br />
late been considerably multiplied. Even the refuse<br />
stone and dust are valuable in many ways.<br /><br />
The county has a fair share of good roads, and has<br />
communication with Baltimore by means of an ex-<br />
cellent turnpike, one branch of which runs to West-<br />
minster, and the other to Manchester. The Balti-<br />
more and Ohio Railroad traverses its southern boun-<br />
dary, and the Western Maryland passes through<br />
the centre of the county from the Baltimore to<br />
the Frederick County line, passing through West-<br />
minster.<br /><br />
The county-seat is Westminster, which has very<br />
considerably increased in business and general wel-<br />
fare since the completion of the Western Maryland<br />
Railroad.<br /><br />
New Windsor, Manchester, Uniontown, and Ta-<br />
neytown are likewise considerable towns. The first<br />
mentioned is a fine and handsome town, and is<br />
a delightful summer resort, having several mineral<br />
springs.<br /><br />
CECIL COUNTY, organized in 1674, and named<br />
in honor of Cecil, Cecilius Lord Baltimore, is the<br />
most northern of the Eastern Shore counties, forms<br />
the north-east corner of the State, being bounded on<br />
the north by Pennsylvania, on the east by Delaware,<br />
(the celebrated Mason and Dixon’s line separating<br />
the three States,) on the south by Sassafras River,<br />
and west by Chesapeake Bay and Susquehanna<br />
River.<br /><br />
This county is one of the most thriving and enter-<br />
prising in the State. The character of the land is<br />
mixed, the part above the Bay being mostly rolling<br />
and quite hilly, like the Western Shore; and below<br />
Elkton, quite level and similar to the adjoining East-<br />
ern Shore counties. The soil also comprises every<br />
variety, a considerable portion centrally situated,<br />
called ¢ The Barrens,” being pure sand and gravel<br />
(though even this section has of late much improved),<br />
whilst other parts have heavier clayey soil, mixed<br />
rocky, and the lower part an excellent light clay loam.<br />
The county is well populated, and the farming and<br />
improvements generally are in advance of the aver-<br />
age throughout the State.<br /><br />
‘Wheat, oats, and corn are the staple farm produec-<br />
tions; very large crops of hay are raised and sent to<br />
Baltimore and elsewhere in bales. In the southern<br />
part, known as Sassafras Neck, are many large<br /><br />
‘peach farms. This crop is very large and profitable<br /><br />
here.<br /><br />
Cecil County possesses inexhaustible quarries of<br />
excellent granite at Port Deposit, on the Susque-<br />
hanna River. Soapstone also exists on the same<br />
river, and in the northern part near to Pennsylvania<br />
are large beds of iron-ore and chrome, comprising a<br />
good proportion of the most valuable chrome mines<br />
in the world. Near North East River are extensive<br />
deposits of clay suitable for making fire-bricks, and,<br /><br /><br /><br />
latterly, discoveries are reported of kaolin or porce-<br />
lain clay of a fine quality.<br /><br />
The county is well watered and possesses some of<br />
the best water-powers, which are in most cases well<br />
improved with large furnaces, forges, rolling-mills,<br />
paper, grist, and saw-mills.<br /><br />
“ Gilpin’s Falls,” on Great North East Creek, is a<br />
wild and romantic place, and is also a great water-<br />
power, which is at present not used. The creek falls<br />
about a hundred feet in but a few hundred feet of<br />
distance. Cecil has also the largest number of shad<br />
and herring fisheries of any county in the State, ex-<br />
tending from the mouth of the Susquehanna River<br />
around the bay and river shores into the Sassafras<br />
River. These shores also afford abundance of wild<br />
fowl in the season.<br /><br />
The county enjoys excellent facilities for transpor-<br />
tation. The Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Balti-<br />
more Railroad traverses the centre, and also the<br />
Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, and the Philadel-<br />
phia Central Railroad crosses the north-western cor-<br />
ner of the county. The bay and rivers have lines of<br />
steamboats running daily.<br /><br />
The county-seat is Elkton, on the Philadelphia,<br />
Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad, a very thriving<br />
town of about 1,800 inhabitants. The town of Port<br />
Deposit, on the Susquehanna River, about 4} miles<br />
above its mouth, is the principal business town, and<br />
transacts a very heavy trade in lumber and logs, which<br />
are rafted down the river from the upper country of<br />
Pennsylvania, and also a large trade in grain and<br />
produce. This town has a steamboat running to<br />
Havre de Grace, and also a daily line to Baltimore<br />
and Philadelphia. The third town in size, Chesa-<br />
peake City, is situated at the western end of the<br />
Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. Other thriving<br />
villages are North East, Brick Meeting-House, Rising<br />
Sun, Cecilton, and Warwick.<br /><br />
CHARLES COUNTY, first settled in 1640, occu-<br />
pies the south-western part of the State, and is<br />
bounded on the west and south by the Potomac<br />
River, which makes here a very large curve in its<br />
course. Prince George’s County bounds it on the<br />
north, and St. Mary’s County on the south-east.<br /><br />
The county has an outlet at Benedict, on the Pa-<br />
tuxent River, having a front thereon of three to four<br />
miles. The surface of the county, like that of St.<br />
Mary’s County, somewhat resembles the Kastern<br /><br />
Shore, being generally low and sandy, though suf--<br /><br />
ficiently rolling to be well drained by the numerous<br />
branches flowing into the bordering rivers.<br /><br />
The soil of Charles County has been much ex-<br />
hausted by neglectful culture, but endeavors are now<br />
being used to restore and improve it. Onthe banks<br />
of Port Tobacco Creek and other points, green sand<br />
shell-marl is found in large quantities, affording an<br />
abundant fertilizer. A large proportion of these de-<br />
posits are situated so as to be worked very cheaply.<br />
The county is entirely devoted to agriculture, the<br />
crops being mostly tobacco, corn, and wheat. The<br />
former is the staple production. Fruits do well<br />
in this section. Fish and oysters abound on these<br />
shores.<br /><br />
Port Tobacco, the county-seat, is a small town<br />
near the head of the creek of the same name.<br />
There are no villages of any importance in the<br />
county.<br /><br />
DORCHESTER COUNTY, organized in 1669, is<br />
on the eastern shore, and extends from the Chesa-<br />
peake Bay to the Delaware State line, and is bounded<br />
on the south-east by the Nanticoke River, separating<br />
it from Somerset County, and on the north by Chop-<br />
tank River, between it and Talbot County, and by<br />
Caroline County. This county, in size, is above<br />
the medium, having an area of about 770 square<br /><br />
miles.<br /><br />
The country is generally level, though the upper<br />
part of the county is sufficiently undulating to create<br />
some water-powers — which are improved by grist<br /><br />

GENERAL DESCRIPTION.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
State, being in length about 32 miles, with an aver-<br />
<br />
age width of only 7 miles. Itisa peninsula, bounded<br />
by the Bay on the east, the Patuxent River on the<br />
west, and on the north by Anne Arundel County.<br />
The surface is undulating, and drains from a central<br />
elevation towards the bay and river, into which nu-<br />
merous little creeks empty.<br />
<br />
The soil is a soft fine mould, except on the Patux-<br />
ent, where it is more clayey, and is well adapted to<br />
the growth of corn, tobacco, and wheat, though the<br />
great staple is tobacco. The climate is generally<br />
warm and mild. The waters of the Chesapeake and<br />
Patuxent abound in the finest fish and oysters; im-<br />
mense quantities of the latter are annually carried to<br />
Baltimore and the Northern markets; the trade em-<br />
ploying large numbers of men. Tripoli, which is<br />
used as a polishing material, is found in many local-<br />
ities, the deposit on the Patuxent being very large.<br />
Marl exists also, affording a good fertilizer in many<br />
localities. Oak, Chestnut, Pine, and Locust are the<br />
natural timber growths, and mostly line the navi-<br />
gable waters.<br />
<br />
CAROLINE COUNTY is of small area, and is<br />
bounded on the east by the State of Delaware, north-<br />
west and west by Queen Anne’s and Talbot, and<br />
south’by Dorchester counties.<br />
<br />
The main branch of the Choptank River runs<br />
through the county, and is navigated by steamboats<br />
to Denton. This, with other crecks, afford excellent<br />
facilities for sending produce to market, and in re-<br />
turn, obtaining lime, ashes, and manures; scarcely<br />
any land lying more than five miles from navigable<br />
water.<br />
<br />
Some of its soils are sandy, some are low meadow-<br />
lands of rich black earth, but the largest proportion<br />
is a loam with a clay subsoil. The last will produce<br />
grains, grasses, vegetables, cotton, and tobacco, which<br />
latter two are raised in small quantities very success-<br />
fully for domestic use. The sandy soil is very pro-<br />
ductive in sweet potatoes, and every variety of vege-<br />
tables and fruits. Peaches are very largely cultivated<br />
and sent to the city markets.<br />
<br />
The general character of the county is level, but<br />
sufficiently undulating to afford drainage, and the<br />
roads are mostly level and hard, and give very fine<br />
travelling facilities. Some excellent fisheries of shad<br />
and herring are in the county, and very large quan-<br />
tities of oysters are marketed. Crabs, wild ducks,<br />
and other game are also abundant.<br />
<br />
The county-seat is at Denton, a quiet town pleas-<br />
antly situated at the head of steamboat navigation<br />
on the Choptank River. Two other considerable<br />
towns are Greensborough and Hillsborough, both<br />
near the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, which<br />
crosses the upper part of the county.<br />
<br />
CARROLL COUNTY is bounded on the north<br />
by Pennsylvania, on the south by Howard County,<br />
on the east by Baltimore County, and on the west by<br />
Frederick County. The surface is mostly undulat-<br />
<br />
ing, watered by fine streams, tributaries of the Pa-<br />
<br />
tapsco and Monocacy rivers, which flow from innu-<br />
merable springs of the purest water. Kxcellent<br />
water-power is afforded by these streams, which is<br />
improved by cotton and woollen factories, merchant<br />
and paper-mills, and numerous saw and grist-mills.<br />
There are also a considerable number of tanneries,<br />
induced, no doubt, by the abundance of fine oak<br />
timber, which comprises the body of the natural<br />
growth of wood. Parr’s Ridge passes through this<br />
county, and is the first elevated ridge approaching<br />
the Alleghanies. From this ridge the Catoctin<br />
Mountains are plainly visible.<br />
<br />
The soils are limestone, “ Red-lands,” and slaty<br />
<br />
soil, all mostly very fertile or easily improved, ren-<br />
<br />
dering it one of the finest agricultural counties of<br />
Maryland. It has but a small proportion of very<br />
poor or unimproved land.<br />
<br />
‘Wheat, rye, corn, and oats are largely produced,<br />
with some potatoes and buckwheat, and latterly con-<br />
<br />
s N A i N il TS<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
siderable sorghum. Tobacco is still raised to some<br />
extent in the lower part of the county, but is yearly<br />
<br />
less cultivated. The grazing is fine, and it ranks as .<br />
<br />
a fine dairy county, producing a large share of the<br />
butter crop of the State. The Pipe Creek, Sam’s<br />
Creek, and Wakefield valleys are unexcelled for fer-<br />
tility and fine farming.<br />
<br />
The county possesses fine building material, a good<br />
species of granite, and other stone. Marble has been<br />
quarried near Sam’s Creek. Large quantities of lime-<br />
stone are quarried in the western, central, and north-<br />
ern part of the county, and large beds of iron ore<br />
are worked in the vicinity of Westminster and else-<br />
where. A number of copper mines have been<br />
opened, and several are now working, in a line ex-<br />
tending from the Springfield mine near Sykesville,<br />
to the Maryland Company’s mine near Finksburg.<br />
<br />
The soapstone quarry near Marriottsville has been<br />
and is still extensively worked, and furnishes the<br />
purest quality of soapstone known. At the manu-<br />
factory in Baltimore, it is sawed and worked into all<br />
imaginable shapes for a great variety of purposes.<br />
The number of uses to which it is applied have of<br />
late been considerably multiplied. Even the refuse<br />
stone and dust are valuable in many ways.<br />
<br />
The county has a fair share of good roads, and has<br />
communication with Baltimore by means of an ex-<br />
cellent turnpike, one branch of which runs to West-<br />
minster, and the other to Manchester. The Balti-<br />
more and Ohio Railroad traverses its southern boun-<br />
dary, and the Western Maryland passes through<br />
the centre of the county from the Baltimore to<br />
the Frederick County line, passing through West-<br />
minster.<br />
<br />
The county-seat is Westminster, which has very<br />
considerably increased in business and general wel-<br />
fare since the completion of the Western Maryland<br />
Railroad.<br />
<br />
New Windsor, Manchester, Uniontown, and Ta-<br />

mentioned is a fine and handsome town, and is<br />
a delightful summer resort, having several mineral<br />

GENERAL DESCRIPTION.<br /><br /><br /><br />
and saw-mills for local business. The soil is vari-<br />
able, and of the same character with most of this<br />
shore of the Bay, ranging from stiff clay to a light<br />
sand, with, in many places, a black loam. Shell-<br />
rmanure affords a good fertilizer. Oak, hickory,<br />
pine, and walnut are the natural timbers, which are<br />
abundant and largely exported. A good part of the<br />
county is uncultivated, but where well tilled the land<br />
is generally quite productive. 'Wheat and corn are<br />
the staples, with large quantities of vegetables, and<br />
also some sorghum is now raised. This county is<br />
largely increasing its production of peaches, which<br />
are being made very profitable crops. Shad and<br />
herring fisheries are numerous, and generally do<br />
well, whilst almost all sections have supplies of fresh<br />
fish. Opysters are very abundant, and of the finest<br />
kind, this county taking in some of the upper part<br />
of the great oyster-beds of Tangier Sound, the most<br />
famous oyster-field of Maryland. .<br /><br />
Dorchester is almost surrounded by navigabl<br />
waters, and is also intersected by the Transquaking,<br />
Chicamacomico, and Blackwater rivers, and Marshy<br />
Ilope Creck, giving facilities for transportation of<br />
produce, ete., nearly all points being conveniently<br />
located to the water. The recent completion of a<br />
railroad 83.5 miles in length, from Cambridge, to<br />
connect with the Delaware Railroad at Seaford, Del.,<br />
has greatly increased the commercial facilities of the<br />
county.<br /><br />
Cambridge is the county-seat, and is a very pleas-<br />
ant town, well situated on the south bank of the<br />
Choptank River. Other villages are East New Mar-<br />
ket, Vienna, and Church Creek.<br /><br />
FREDERICK COUNTY ranks with the largest<br />
counties, and is bounded on the north by Pennsyl-<br />
vania, on the east by Carroll County, south-easterly<br />
by Montgomery County, south by the Potomac River<br />
and Virginia, and on the west by the Blue Ridge, or<br />
South Mountains, separating it from Washington<br />
County.<br /><br />
This is one of the richest and most beautiful coun-<br />
ties of the State. The soil is mostly limestone, with<br />
some slaty, and considerable “red-lands.” The sur-<br />
face is undulating — partly mountainous —the Ca-<br />
toctin Mountains dividing the county into two broad<br />
valleys, that to the westward being known as the<br />
Middletown Valley, which is drained by the Catoctin<br />
River and its branches; and that east of the Catoc-<br />
tin range is the valley of the Monocacy. Both<br />
rivers flow southward into the Potomac. These two<br />
great valleys are unsurpassed for rural beauty and<br />
excellent farming, and produce extraordinary crops<br />
of the principal grains of this latitude. The eastern<br />
slope of the Catocti Mountain is a most excellent<br />
grape country.<br /><br />
The county is well watered by innumerable pure<br />
springs, which flow into the branches of the rivers<br />
before named, and create abundance of water-powers,<br />
which are improved by large grist- and saw-mills,<br />
and merchant or flour-mills. There are also a<br />
number of other mills, tanneries, and various do-<br />
mestic manufactures. An immense water-power<br />
unimproved, exists on the Potomac River at Wever-<br />
ton. The narrow valley between the Monocacy and<br />
Buckeystown has a rich deposit of a marl composed<br />
of lime and earthy substance, which extends to a<br />
considerable depth; this with the limestone yield an<br />
inexhaustible supply of manure.<br /><br />
Copper mines in the Linganore section have been<br />
worked since the Revolutionary war. Near Liberty<br />
and New London are several mines, now extensively<br />
operated. There are several slate quarries, one of<br />
which near Ijamsville, on the Baltimore and Ohio<br />
Railroad, produces a large supply of excellent roofing<br />
material. Along the side of Catoctin Mountain iron<br />
ore abounds, of the brown hematite species. Some<br />
of these beds, although worked for eighty years, secem<br />
to be inexhaustible. From Woodsborough to the<br />
Potomac is a range of limestone marble unusually<br />
pure, varying in color from blue to dove color. It<br /><br /><br /><br />
takes a beautiful polish, and is similar to the famed<br />
Italian marbles of that color. At the foot of Catoc-<br />
tin Mountain there is a similar bed, and one resem-<br />
bling verde antique. West of Frederick is another<br />
kind of variegated shades of light and dark red, and<br />
on the west side of Monocacy is found the variety<br />
widely known, from having been used for the col-<br />
umns in the old hall of the House of Representatives<br />
of the Capitol at Washington. Frederick County<br />
is now centrally traversed by the Baltimore and<br />
Ohio Railroad, whose company is also now building<br />
a branch from the Point of Rocks, to run through<br />
Montgomery County direct to Washington, whilst<br />
along the southern border, on the Potomac River,<br />
runs the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and the West-<br />
ern Maryland Railroad is extended from Union<br />
Bridge at the eastern border of the county to Hagers-<br />
town. These together afford good transportation to<br />
all portions of the county.<br /><br />
The county-seat is at Frederick City, a very pleas-<br />
ant city of about 9,000 inhabitants, situated in a very<br />
fine fertile district. In addition to this city, the<br />
county is dotted with considerable towns, all sus-<br />
tained by the surrounding country, such as Middle-<br />
town, New Market, Jefferson, and others.<br /><br />
HARFORD COUNTY, organized in 1773, is of<br /><br />
medium size, is the north-eastern corner of the west-<br /><br />
ern shore of the State, and is bounded on the east<br />
and south-east by the Susquehanna River and Ches-<br />
apeake Bay, on the north by Pennsylvania, and on<br />
the west and south-west by Baltimore County.<br /><br />
This county possesses a great variety of soils. The<br />
lower part being level and composed of some sandy<br />
and some clay lands, but mostly of a light loam, very<br />
easily worked and improved. The section called the<br />
Necks has mostly very fine and large farms, with ex-<br />
tensive peach orchards. The country above the<br />
Philadelphia turnpike is undulating and in some<br />
parts very hilly, the soil comprising clay, light-loam,<br />
and considerable limestone, the last-mentioned being<br />
mostly found in the upper part of the county.<br /><br />
This county is well watered by branches emptying<br />
into the Little Gunpowder River, and Winter’s and<br />
Binum’s Runs, which flow southward into the Ches-<br />
apeake, and by Deer Creek and its tributaries, which<br />
drain the northern part of the county, and flow into<br />
the Susquehanna. ¢ The Rocks of Deer Creek” is<br />
one of the most romantic spots in the State, and<br />
well worth a visit of the admirers of the great works<br />
of nature. These rocks form a great promontory<br />
projecting over the road, passing along the bank of<br />
the creek. :<br /><br />
Perhaps no county in the State has improved more<br />
in appearance, fertility, and general prosperity during<br />
the last twenty years than Harford.<br /><br />
The productions are wheat, buckwheat, oats, and<br />
corn, and recently considerable crops of sorghum<br /><br />
have been raised, and made into a fine syrup by a -<br /><br />
number of mills erected for that purpose.<br /><br />
This county possesses fine water-powers, improved<br />
by furnaces, factories, foundries, some flour-mills, and<br />
numerous saw- and grist-mills.<br /><br />
In this county are large quarries of excellent build-<br />
ing-stone of a gneiss or granite character.<br /><br />
This county possesses large beds of iron ore, and<br />
some of the most valuable chrome beds in the world.<br />
Also, near the Pennsylvania line, extensive slate<br />
quarries have been worked, and near Abingdon there<br />
exists a very large deposit of kaolin or poreelain clay<br />
of a pure white color, and very good quality, fit for<br />
making fine porcelain ware.<br /><br />
Very large shad and herring fisheries are located<br />
around the Susquehanna and Bay shore, and innu-<br />
merable flocks of’ wild fowl swarm around the tide-<br />
waters of the county, and afford, with the fisheries,<br />
a good business for many of the inhabitants of that<br />
region.<br /><br />
The Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore<br />
Railroad passes through the county from Havre de<br />
Grace, and the Tidewater Canal runs aleng the west<br /><br /><br /><br />
bank of the Susquehanna, having its outlet at Havre -<br /><br />
de Grace.<br /><br />
The county-seat is Belair, a small but pleasant<br />
town of 300 or 400 inhabitants, and is situated in an<br />
improved neighborhood.<br /><br />
The principal town is Havre de Grace, at the mouth<br />
of the Susquehanna River. It has about 2,500 in-<br />
habitants, and does a considerable lumber and coal<br />
business. It received its name from French officers<br />
in the Revolutionary army, who were passing through<br />
at about the time it was laid out, and fancied that<br />
it resembled the city of the same name in France.<br /><br />
Port Deposit, four miles above Havre de Grace, is<br />
at the head of tide-water and sloop navigation, and<br />
has an extensive lumber trade.<br /><br />
HOWARD COUNTY, formed since 1850 out of<br />
the north-west part of Anne Arundel, is one of the<br />
smallest counties, having a length of about twenty-<br />
five miles, and a width of about twelve miles, and is<br />
centrally situated between the head-waters of the<br />
Patapsco and Patuxent rivers, the west branch of the<br />
former stream separating it from Carroll and Balti-<br />
more counties, on the north and east, and the main<br />
branch of the Patuxent bounding on the south-west<br />
between it and Montgomery and Prince George’s<br />
counties, Anne Arundel County bounds it on the<br />
south-east.<br /><br />
This county is very undulating, and the soil mostly<br />
good, though not all improved, with considerable<br />
fine limestone land in the central and southern parts.<br />
It is completely intersected with spring branches<br />
flowing into the larger streams, and affording a large<br />
amount of excellent water-powers, which are mostly<br />
improved by factories, mills, furnaces, etc. Some of<br />
the very best water-powers and largest factories in<br />
the State are on its two boundary streams. Inex-<br />
haustible quarries of granite exist in the county; one<br />
variety near the upper end of the county much re-<br />
sembles the famous Quincy granite. The largest<br />
quarries, or those most extensively worked, are be-<br />
tween Sykesville and Baltimore, on the Patapsco,<br />
from which stone the Cathedral and Record Office<br />
in Baltimore were built. Another variety, called<br />
porphyritic granite, has reddish crystals of feldspar<br />
disseminated through it. There are large iron-ore<br />
beds next to Anne Arundel County, and near the<br />
Washington Railroad. IToward has thirty-one miles<br />
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad on one side, and<br />
twelve miles of the Washington Branch Railroad on<br />
the south-east, which together give convenient access<br />
to almost all parts of the county. This accessibility,<br />
with the eminent natural advantages of pure air and<br />
water, and innumerable beautiful building sites, are<br />
promoting improvements, and the vicinity of the<br />
railroads is being built up with fine country-seats.<br />
Near the centre of the county is the Doughoregan<br />
Manor of Charles Carroll, of Carrollton, containing<br />
nearly 14,000 acres of the finest land in the county.<br /><br />
The county-seat is Ellicott’s Mills, a considerable<br />
town on the Patapsco, surrounded with very ro-<br />
mantic scenery, and many manufactories. Two other<br />
considerable towns in the county are Elkridge Land-<br />
ing and Lisbon.<br /><br />
KENT COUNTY, organized in 1650, is the sec-<br />
ond in the tier of Hastern Shore counties, and is<br />
bounded on the Kast by Delaware, and is a peninsula<br />
lying between the Sassafras River on the north, sep-<br />
arating it from Cecil County, the Chesapeake Bay on<br />
the west, and the Chester River on the south and<br />
southeast, separating it from Queen Anne’s County.<br /><br />
The country is level though not very low, and<br />
sufficiently rolling to be well drained by many<br />
creeks flowing into its border rivers and the Bay.<br /><br />
The soil is mostly a light friable clayey loam, very<br />
easily improved and productive. ""Wheat, oats, and<br />
corn, and every variety of vegetables, grow abun-<br />
dantly. The farms are very fine where attended<br />
with any care, and latterly nearly every farm has its<br />
orchards of hundreds, and in some instances thou-<br /><br />

 <br />
<br />
and saw-mills for local business. The soil is vari-<br />
able, and of the same character with most of this<br />
shore of the Bay, ranging from stiff clay to a light<br />
sand, with, in many places, a black loam. Shell-<br />
rmanure affords a good fertilizer. Oak, hickory,<br />
pine, and walnut are the natural timbers, which are<br />
abundant and largely exported. A good part of the<br />
county is uncultivated, but where well tilled the land<br />
is generally quite productive. 'Wheat and corn are<br />
the staples, with large quantities of vegetables, and<br />
also some sorghum is now raised. This county is<br />
largely increasing its production of peaches, which<br />
are being made very profitable crops. Shad and<br />
herring fisheries are numerous, and generally do<br />
well, whilst almost all sections have supplies of fresh<br />
fish. Opysters are very abundant, and of the finest<br />
kind, this county taking in some of the upper part<br />
of the great oyster-beds of Tangier Sound, the most<br />
famous oyster-field of Maryland. .<br />
<br />
Dorchester is almost surrounded by navigabl<br />
waters, and is also intersected by the Transquaking,<br />
Chicamacomico, and Blackwater rivers, and Marshy<br />
Ilope Creck, giving facilities for transportation of<br />
produce, ete., nearly all points being conveniently<br />
located to the water. The recent completion of a<br />
railroad 83.5 miles in length, from Cambridge, to<br />
connect with the Delaware Railroad at Seaford, Del.,<br />
has greatly increased the commercial facilities of the<br />
county.<br />
<br />
Cambridge is the county-seat, and is a very pleas-<br />
ant town, well situated on the south bank of the<br />
Choptank River. Other villages are East New Mar-<br />
ket, Vienna, and Church Creek.<br />
<br />
FREDERICK COUNTY ranks with the largest<br />
counties, and is bounded on the north by Pennsyl-<br />
vania, on the east by Carroll County, south-easterly<br />
by Montgomery County, south by the Potomac River<br />
and Virginia, and on the west by the Blue Ridge, or<br />
South Mountains, separating it from Washington<br />
County.<br />
<br />
This is one of the richest and most beautiful coun-<br />
ties of the State. The soil is mostly limestone, with<br />
some slaty, and considerable “red-lands.” The sur-<br />
face is undulating — partly mountainous —the Ca-<br />
toctin Mountains dividing the county into two broad<br />
valleys, that to the westward being known as the<br />
Middletown Valley, which is drained by the Catoctin<br />
River and its branches; and that east of the Catoc-<br />
tin range is the valley of the Monocacy. Both<br />
rivers flow southward into the Potomac. These two<br />
great valleys are unsurpassed for rural beauty and<br />
excellent farming, and produce extraordinary crops<br />
of the principal grains of this latitude. The eastern<br />
slope of the Catocti Mountain is a most excellent<br />
grape country.<br />
<br />
The county is well watered by innumerable pure<br />
springs, which flow into the branches of the rivers<br />
before named, and create abundance of water-powers,<br />
which are improved by large grist- and saw-mills,<br />
and merchant or flour-mills. There are also a<br />
number of other mills, tanneries, and various do-<br />
mestic manufactures. An immense water-power<br />
unimproved, exists on the Potomac River at Wever-<br />
ton. The narrow valley between the Monocacy and<br />
Buckeystown has a rich deposit of a marl composed<br />
of lime and earthy substance, which extends to a<br />
considerable depth; this with the limestone yield an<br />
inexhaustible supply of manure.<br />
<br />
Copper mines in the Linganore section have been<br />
worked since the Revolutionary war. Near Liberty<br />
and New London are several mines, now extensively<br />
operated. There are several slate quarries, one of<br />
which near Ijamsville, on the Baltimore and Ohio<br />
Railroad, produces a large supply of excellent roofing<br />
material. Along the side of Catoctin Mountain iron<br />
ore abounds, of the brown hematite species. Some<br />
of these beds, although worked for eighty years, secem<br />
to be inexhaustible. From Woodsborough to the<br />
Potomac is a range of limestone marble unusually<br />
pure, varying in color from blue to dove color. It<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
takes a beautiful polish, and is similar to the famed<br />
Italian marbles of that color. At the foot of Catoc-<br />
tin Mountain there is a similar bed, and one resem-<br />
bling verde antique. West of Frederick is another<br />
kind of variegated shades of light and dark red, and<br />
on the west side of Monocacy is found the variety<br />
widely known, from having been used for the col-<br />
umns in the old hall of the House of Representatives<br />
of the Capitol at Washington. Frederick County<br />
is now centrally traversed by the Baltimore and<br />
Ohio Railroad, whose company is also now building<br />
a branch from the Point of Rocks, to run through<br />
Montgomery County direct to Washington, whilst<br />
along the southern border, on the Potomac River,<br />
runs the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and the West-<br />
ern Maryland Railroad is extended from Union<br />
Bridge at the eastern border of the county to Hagers-<br />
town. These together afford good transportation to<br />
all portions of the county.<br />
<br />
The county-seat is at Frederick City, a very pleas-<br />
ant city of about 9,000 inhabitants, situated in a very<br />
fine fertile district. In addition to this city, the<br />
county is dotted with considerable towns, all sus-<br />
tained by the surrounding country, such as Middle-<br />
town, New Market, Jefferson, and others.<br />
<br />

9<br /><br /><br /><br />
sands of peach-trees, producing immense crops of<br />
this delicious fruit, which are taken to market by<br />
the Sassafras and Chester River steamers, which run<br />
daily most of the year. Several single peach-<br />
orchards in the county yield sufficient to employ one<br />
steamer in the fruit season. Other fruits grow well<br />
where cultivated.<br /><br />
Kent has abundance of fine fishing, and on the<br />
Bay shore and in Chester River inexhaustible oyster<br />
beds, which give employment to a large portion of<br />
the population, and during the season is generally<br />
surrounded by flocks of thousands of wild ducks,<br />
swans, etc., which also afford fine gume and much<br />
profit to many persons.<br /><br />
Chestertown is the county-seat, and is a very pretty<br />
town regularly laid out, and very pleasantly situated<br />
on the west side of Chester River. It is dependent<br />
for support upon the surrounding country, its best<br />
trade being in grain, produce, fruit, and oysters.<br /><br />
MONTGOMERY COUNTY is bounded on the<br />
south-west by Virginia, on the north-west by Fred-<br />
erick County, on the north-east by the Patuxent<br />
River which separates it from Howard County, and<br />
on the south-cast by Prince George’s County and the<br />
District of Columbia.<br /><br />
Large quarries of sandstone are opened near the<br />
mouth of Seneca Creek, of which the Smithsonian<br />
Institute at Washington is built, and also a marble<br />
quarry near the Potomac above Poolesville. A<br />
quarry of excellent roofing-slate has been opened<br />
near Hyattstown. Other varieties of building-stones<br />
exist, but are not developed to any extent. Several<br />
gold mines are being worked in the northern part of<br />
the county and near the Great Falls of Potomac.<br />
Also chrome ore has been largely extracted from the<br />
central part of the county.<br /><br />
The surface of the county is mostly hilly, and<br />
gives rise to many branches and creeks, which pos-<br />
sess some of the finest water-powers; this being, in<br />
fact, one of the features of this county, most of the<br />
streams having very considerable fall in but a short<br />
distance. The Great Falls of the Potomac belongs<br />
to Montgomery County, and constitutes perhaps the<br />
greatest available water-power in the Union. These<br />
water-powers are partly improved with a number of<br />
large flour- and grist- and saw-mills.<br /><br />
The soil varies greatly, the western or upper part<br />
of the county being a finely cultivated and fertile<br />
region, whilst the more northern part, although<br />
more thickly settled, is a thinner and poorer soil.<br />
The eastern section, near to Howard and Prince<br />
George’s counties, is mostly a light sandy, with some<br />
clay land, and exhibits, in its vast improvements<br />
about Sandy Spring, what may be accomplished by<br />
industrious skilful tillage. These lands, which were<br />
formerly almost a wilderness, with a value of two<br />
or three dollars per acre, have become an ex-<br />
cellent farming district, and worth $30 an acre and<br />
more.<br /><br />
This county bounds the District of Columbia on<br />
the north-west and partly on the north-east, and<br />
from its proximity to Washington (which is one of<br />
the best markets), is being cultivated considerably in<br />
market farms. Its elevated and very healthy. char-<br />
acter is also attracting many persons to locate coun-<br />
try-seats. These will, no doubt, largely increase in<br />
numbers on the completion of the Metropolitan<br />
Branch Railroad.<br /><br />
The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal runs along its<br />
entire south-western border, and the Metropolitan<br />
Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which<br />
is located from near the ¢“Point of Rocks” to<br />
‘Washington, will pass through the centre of the<br />
county, affording convenient access to nearly all<br />
parts. ‘<br /><br />
The county-seat is Rockville, the principal town<br />
in the county, which has a population of about 500<br />
inhabitants. Other smaller villages are Poolesville,<br />
Brookeville, Hyattstown, Damascus, Triadelphia,<br />
Sandy Spring, and Darnestown.<br /><br />

PRINCE GEORGE’S COUNTY, organized 1695,<br />
has an area of 500 square miles, and is bounded by<br />
the Patuxent River on the north-east and east, on<br />
the south by Charles County, on the west by the<br />
Potomac River, and on the north-west by the Dis-<br />
trict of Columbia and Montgomery County.<br /><br />
The soil consists mostly of the best loam and sand<br />
intermixed with clay. The underlying strata is marl<br />
and cemented sand, resembling sandstone. The<br />
surface is rolling, and well supplied with springs<br />
and running streams flowing into the two boundary<br />
rivers. These streams have considerable water-<br />
powers, some of them improved with saw and grist<br />
mills. At Laurel, on the Patuxent, is a large cotton<br />
factory.<br /><br />
Prince George’s is an agricultural county, and<br />
ranks with the best counties in the State. The dis-<br />
trict known as “The Forrest” is celebrated for its<br />
fine farms, and is unsurpassed in fertility and pro-<br />
ductions. The principal products are tobacco, corn,<br />
wheat, and rye. Tobacco is the great crop of the<br />
county, and amounted, in 1860, to 13,446,550 lbs.,<br />
being much the greatest production of any one<br />
county in the Union, and about one-third of the crop<br />
of the whole State. The corn crop is also very large.<br /><br />
Iron ore is abundant in several localities, and near<br />
Oxen Creek are large supplies of sulphuret of iron,<br />
which it is thought might be manufactured into sul-<br />
phuric acid. At Fort Washington there is a ferru-<br />
ginous clay, known as ¢ bole,” which is employed to<br />
dye cloth and thread a red color. Tripoli is also<br />
found in many localities, and some of it has been<br />
exported from Nottingham.<br /><br />
The State Agricultural College is situated north<br />
of Bladensburg, in a locality surrounded by some of<br />
the finest farms in Maryland.<br /><br />
Prince George’s has some of the largest shad and<br />
herring fisheries on the Potomac, and on the Pa-<br />
tuxent are extensive beds of fine oysters.<br />
~ The county has, for transporting produce, the Po-<br />
tomac and Patuxent rivers, which are traversed by<br />
many sailing-vessels, besides lines of steamers to<br />
‘Washington and Hill’s Landing on the latter river.<br />
The Baltimore and Washington Railroad also crosses<br />
the northern part of the county.<br /><br />
The county-seat is Upper Marlborough, a small<br />
town. The other towns of importance are Laurel, a<br />
thriving manufacturing village on the Patuxent<br />
River and Baltimore Railroad, and Bladensburg,<br />
also near the railroad and but a few miles from<br />
Washington, and near the battle-ground of the last<br />
war with England in 1814. ,<br /><br />
QUEEN ANNE COUNTY, organized in 1706, is<br />
on the eastern shore of the Bay, extending from the<br />
State of Delaware on the east to the Chesapeake on<br /><br />
the west, and is bounded on the north by the Chester ‘<br /><br />
River, and on the south by Talbot and Caroline coun-<br />
ties. It includes Kent Island, the largest island in<br />
the Chesapeake Bay, which is about fifteen miles<br />
long. Kent Island is important in the history of<br />
Maryland as having been the site of the first white<br />
settlement within the State.<br /><br />
The surface is level and generally low, and the<br />
soils, though various, are mostly of the kind known<br />
as white-oak soil, with a red clay sub-soil, and are<br />
easily worked, and with reasonable attention are<br />
very fertile, producing excellent crops of grain and<br />
grasses. Much of this county is very fine, Kent<br />
Island and the central section especially exhibiting<br />
very fine and flourishing farms. Vegetable or truck<br />
farms are becoming numerous, as also are fruit farms<br />
and peach orchards.<br /><br />
This county is two-thirds bounded by navigable<br />
water, placing nearly all parts of the county con-<br />
venient to market by bay vessels and steamboats ply-<br />
ing north and south of it daily. The water is good,<br />
and the county is drained by numerous creeks, along<br />
which patches of forest dot every farm.<br /><br />
Marl is abundant, and is much used as a fertilizer.<br />
The only mineral found is bog iron-ore.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Queen Anne has unlimited supplies of fish, oysters,<br />
and wild fowl,in the inlets surrounding its shores.<br /><br />
Centreville, the county-seat, is a small town situ-<br />
ated at the head of Corsica Creek, which is navi-<br />
gable for light-draught vessels. Queenstown, Crump-<br />
ton, and Sudlersville are other small villages.<br /><br />
SAINT MARY’S COUNTY, settled in about<br />
1634, occupies the south-eastern extremity of the west-<br />
ern shore of the Chesapeake Bay, and forms a penin-<br />
sula bounded south-westerly by the Potomac River,<br />
easterly and north-easterly by the Bay and Patux-<br />
ent River, and on the north-west by Charles County,<br />
being almost insulated by the finest and deepest<br />
waters, This is the oldest county in the State. The<br />
site of the old town of St. Mary’s is on the river of<br />
the same name, and was the place where the first<br />
settlement was made under the grant of Lord Balti-<br />
more, and where the first government of the colony<br />
or province of Maryland was held for many years,<br />
until the ascendancy of the Protestant or Puritan<br />
element. The portion of the county bounding on<br />
the Patuxent was originally part of Calvert County.<br />
The county is well drained by numerous creeks and<br />
branches, though not very elevated. The south-<br />
eastern portion is mostly level and low, but the<br />
north-western part is undulating, giving some water-<br />
power, which is improved by grist and saw mills.<br />
The soil when first settled was mostly a rich black<br />
mould, of considerable depth; but from excessive<br />
culture, without rest or renovation, it was much re-<br />
duced in productiveness; but in the last thirty years<br />
a great improvement has taken place, lime and marl<br />
having been extensively used.<br /><br />
Tobacco and corn are the principal crops of the<br />
county. The climate much resembles that of the<br />
Eastern Shore, and it would no doubt be as produc-<br />
tive in fruits, ete. No rocks or minerals of note are<br />
found, but marl is abundant.<br /><br />
The county has excellent water communication by<br />
large steamers, which continually run on the Bay and<br />
Potomac and Patuxent rivers. Kish, oysters, and<br />
wild fowl abound.<br /><br />
Point Lookout, at the mouth of the Potomac, and<br />
Piney Point, on the same river, some distance<br />
above, are watering-places, both celebrated for their<br />
invigorating sea-air and excellent bathing-grounds.<br /><br />
The county-seat is Leonardtown, a small town near<br />
the head of Breton’s Bay. There are no towns of<br />
any size in the county.<br /><br />
SOMERSET is the southernmost Bay county of<br />
the Eastern Shore. It is bounded north by Wico-<br />
mico County, east by Worcester, south by Pocomoke<br />
River and Sound, and west by Chesapeake Bay.<br /><br />
The Pocomoke River, which forms the south-east-<br />
ern boundary, is navigable into Worcester County.<br />
Other navigable waters are the Manokin, and the<br />
Annemessex, and Little Annemessex rivers, and<br />
‘Wicomico and Monie creeks. All these waters run<br />
a good distance into the county, giving water com-<br />
munication to nearly all portions. The county in-<br />
cludes the large islands, South Marsh and Smith’s,<br />
lying between the Chesapeake Bay and Tangier<br />
Sound. The surface is level generally, though suf-<br />
ficiently undulating to give a considerable number<br />
of mill seats, improved mostly by grist- and saw-mills<br />
for local uses.<br /><br />
The soil in the northern part is a sand and clay<br />
mixed, and the lower section is mostly a strong clay<br />
soil well adapted to the growth of grain. The pro-<br />
ductions of the county are principally corn, wheat,<br />
oats, and potatoes, with some market vegetables and<br />
fruits. Sweet potatoes are cultivated very largely,<br />
and yield extraordinary crops. In many parts wool<br />
and cotton are raised in sufficient quantities for do-<br />
mestic uses. The soil of Somerset is particularly<br />
adapted to the growth of market truck, and with<br />
its mild climate, caused by proximity to the Bay<br />
and ocean, no county could excel it in the produc-<br />
tion of early or tender plants. The greatest mine<br /><br />

sands of peach-trees, producing immense crops of<br />
this delicious fruit, which are taken to market by<br />
the Sassafras and Chester River steamers, which run<br />
daily most of the year. Several single peach-<br />
orchards in the county yield sufficient to employ one<br />
steamer in the fruit season. Other fruits grow well<br />
where cultivated.<br />
<br />
Kent has abundance of fine fishing, and on the<br />
Bay shore and in Chester River inexhaustible oyster<br />
beds, which give employment to a large portion of<br />
the population, and during the season is generally<br />
surrounded by flocks of thousands of wild ducks,<br />
swans, etc., which also afford fine gume and much<br />
profit to many persons.<br />
<br />
Chestertown is the county-seat, and is a very pretty<br />
town regularly laid out, and very pleasantly situated<br />
on the west side of Chester River. It is dependent<br />
for support upon the surrounding country, its best<br />
trade being in grain, produce, fruit, and oysters.<br />
<br />
MONTGOMERY COUNTY is bounded on the<br />
south-west by Virginia, on the north-west by Fred-<br />
erick County, on the north-east by the Patuxent<br />
River which separates it from Howard County, and<br />
on the south-cast by Prince George’s County and the<br />
District of Columbia.<br />
<br />
Large quarries of sandstone are opened near the<br />
mouth of Seneca Creek, of which the Smithsonian<br />
Institute at Washington is built, and also a marble<br />
quarry near the Potomac above Poolesville. A<br />
quarry of excellent roofing-slate has been opened<br />
near Hyattstown. Other varieties of building-stones<br />
exist, but are not developed to any extent. Several<br />
gold mines are being worked in the northern part of<br />
the county and near the Great Falls of Potomac.<br />
Also chrome ore has been largely extracted from the<br />
central part of the county.<br />
<br />
The surface of the county is mostly hilly, and<br />
gives rise to many branches and creeks, which pos-<br />
sess some of the finest water-powers; this being, in<br />
fact, one of the features of this county, most of the<br />
streams having very considerable fall in but a short<br />
distance. The Great Falls of the Potomac belongs<br />
to Montgomery County, and constitutes perhaps the<br />
greatest available water-power in the Union. These<br />
water-powers are partly improved with a number of<br />
large flour- and grist- and saw-mills.<br />
<br />
The soil varies greatly, the western or upper part<br />
of the county being a finely cultivated and fertile<br />
region, whilst the more northern part, although<br />
more thickly settled, is a thinner and poorer soil.<br />
The eastern section, near to Howard and Prince<br />
George’s counties, is mostly a light sandy, with some<br />
clay land, and exhibits, in its vast improvements<br />
about Sandy Spring, what may be accomplished by<br />
industrious skilful tillage. These lands, which were<br />
formerly almost a wilderness, with a value of two<br />
or three dollars per acre, have become an ex-<br />
cellent farming district, and worth $30 an acre and<br />
more.<br />
<br />
This county bounds the District of Columbia on<br />
the north-west and partly on the north-east, and<br />
from its proximity to Washington (which is one of<br />
the best markets), is being cultivated considerably in<br />
market farms. Its elevated and very healthy. char-<br />
acter is also attracting many persons to locate coun-<br />
try-seats. These will, no doubt, largely increase in<br />
numbers on the completion of the Metropolitan<br />
Branch Railroad.<br />
<br />
The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal runs along its<br />
entire south-western border, and the Metropolitan<br />
Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which<br />
is located from near the ¢“Point of Rocks” to<br />
‘Washington, will pass through the centre of the<br />
county, affording convenient access to nearly all<br />
parts. ‘<br />
<br />
The county-seat is Rockville, the principal town<br />
in the county, which has a population of about 500<br />
inhabitants. Other smaller villages are Poolesville,<br />
Brookeville, Hyattstown, Damascus, Triadelphia,<br />
Sandy Spring, and Darnestown.<br />

PRINCE GEORGE’S COUNTY, organized 1695,<br />
has an area of 500 square miles, and is bounded by<br />
the Patuxent River on the north-east and east, on<br />
the south by Charles County, on the west by the<br />
Potomac River, and on the north-west by the Dis-<br />
trict of Columbia and Montgomery County.<br />
<br />
The soil consists mostly of the best loam and sand<br />
intermixed with clay. The underlying strata is marl<br />
and cemented sand, resembling sandstone. The<br />
surface is rolling, and well supplied with springs<br />
and running streams flowing into the two boundary<br />
rivers. These streams have considerable water-<br />
powers, some of them improved with saw and grist<br />
mills. At Laurel, on the Patuxent, is a large cotton<br />
factory.<br />
<br />
Prince George’s is an agricultural county, and<br />
ranks with the best counties in the State. The dis-<br />
trict known as “The Forrest” is celebrated for its<br />
fine farms, and is unsurpassed in fertility and pro-<br />
ductions. The principal products are tobacco, corn,<br />
wheat, and rye. Tobacco is the great crop of the<br />
county, and amounted, in 1860, to 13,446,550 lbs.,<br />
being much the greatest production of any one<br />
county in the Union, and about one-third of the crop<br />
of the whole State. The corn crop is also very large.<br />
<br />
Iron ore is abundant in several localities, and near<br />
Oxen Creek are large supplies of sulphuret of iron,<br />
which it is thought might be manufactured into sul-<br />
phuric acid. At Fort Washington there is a ferru-<br />
ginous clay, known as ¢ bole,” which is employed to<br />
dye cloth and thread a red color. Tripoli is also<br />
found in many localities, and some of it has been<br />
exported from Nottingham.<br />
<br />
The State Agricultural College is situated north<br />
of Bladensburg, in a locality surrounded by some of<br />
the finest farms in Maryland.<br />

GENERAL DESCRIPTION.<br /><br /><br /><br />
of wealth, of Somerset County, is in its inexhausti-<br />
ble oyster-beds, which are unexcelled in their quality<br />
by any country known. These include the greater<br />
part of the Tangier Sound, which produces the fa-<br />
mous Tangier oysters. The oyster trade employs a<br />
very large portion of the population on the islands<br />
and shores of the Sound and rivers. Fish and wild<br />
fowl are also abundant.<br /><br />
The county town is Princess Anne, situated near<br />
the head of Manokin River, which town has about<br />
1,000 inhabitants.<br /><br />
TALBOT COUNTY occupies a central position<br />
among the Eastern Shore counties, being immedi-<br />
ately on the bay shore, and bounded southerly and<br />
south-easterly by the Choptank River and Tuckahoe<br />
Creek, the former separating it from Dorchester,<br />
and the latter from Caroline County. It is bounded<br />
on the North by Queen Anne, which is partly sepa-<br />
rated from it by Wye River.<br /><br />
Seven-eighths of the outline of Talbot is bounded<br />
by navigable waters, and it has also running inland<br />
Third Haven, Harris, and Broad creeks, and St. Mi-<br />
chael’s and Miles’ rivers, dividing it into peninsulas<br />
or necks, and several considerable islands, so that<br />
three-fourths of the farms have navigable water at<br />
their very doors, and of the balance the farthest is<br />
not five miles from a landing.<br /><br />
Talbot has a healthy, mild climate (being tem-<br />
pered by the surrounding waters), and is considered<br />
by its enterprising citizens as the garden spot of<br />
this section.<br /><br />
The soil in the upper part is loamy with a red<br />
clay sub-soil, and the lower part principally ¢ white<br />
oak.” - Both sections are fertile and very productive<br />
in grains and fruits. Deposits of shell marl are very<br />
large and numerous, and also the green sand marl,<br />
similar to that found in New Jersey. The county<br />
produces excellent crops of wheat, corn, oats, Irish<br />
and sweet potatoes, and latterly peaches are becom-<br />
ing a leading production, and no doubt yield a large<br />
profit, the climate being highly favorable to their<br />
growth ; also considerable sorghum, flax, butter, and<br />
honey have been made of late.<br /><br />
The finest fish, oysters, and wild fowl are abun-<br />
dant.<br /><br />
Easton, the county-seat, is situated near the head-<br />
waters of Third Haven Creek. St. Michael’s is<br />
another very pleasant village, lying on the river of<br />
the same name. The only other town of impor-<br />
tance is Oxford, at the mouth of Third Haven Creek,<br />
and which is the termination of the Maryland and<br />
Delaware Railroad, now completed to Haston, the<br />
county-seat.<br /><br />
WASHINGTON COUNTY is situated in the<br />
western part of the State, and bounded on the north<br />
by Pennsylvania, east by the Blue Ridge or South<br />
Mountains, separating it from Frederick County,<br />
south and south-westerly by the Potomac River, and<br />
~ on the west by Alleghany County.<br /><br />
The surface of the county is partly mountainous,<br />
being crossed by a number of ridges, between which,<br />
however, are several fine broad valleys, drained by<br />
Antietam, Conococheague, and Israel creeks. The<br />
minerals of the county have not been much devel-<br />
oped. The principal rocks are limestone and slate.<br />
Iron ore is known to exist in abundance in several<br />
localities, and limestone in immense quantities. Hy-<br />
draulic cement is found near Hancock, and below<br />
Williamsport is a hard calcareous slate, which splits<br />
into parallel layers, and takes a fine polish, and is<br />
very durable. Emery (corundum) is found near the<br />
Antietam.<br /><br />
The soil is principally limestone, with some slate<br />
and white-oak land.<br /><br />
In the eastern part of the county is the great<br />
valley of the Antietam Creek, commonly called the<br />
Hagerstown Valley, that town occupying a central<br />
position therein. This valley is mostly limestone<br /><br /><br /><br />
land, which is unusually productive, and gives crops<br />
of wheat and other grains unexcelled by any por-<br />
tion of the State. The wheat is equally fine in<br />
quality as in quantity, and is manufactured into<br />
excellent flour, there being a large number of mill<br />
seats, improved by fine merchant flour-mills.<br /><br />
This valley has been made famous by the military<br />
operations of the great contending armies during the<br />
war just closed, and also suffered very largely from<br />
these operations. The great battle of Antietam was<br />
fought by the two armies, with columns stretching<br />
north and south on either side and facing the town<br />
of Sharpsburg. So great is the natural wealth and<br />
comparative power of this valley, and the industry<br />
of the people, that but few traces can now be seen<br />
of the damage then done. This county ranks with<br />
the most productive and best populated, although<br />
not very well supplied heretofore with transporting<br />
facilities, excepting good roads. The Chesapeake<br />
and Ohio Canal follows the entire border on the Po-<br />
tomac River, and from Hagerstown the Franklin<br />
Railroad runs northerly into Pennsylvania.<br /><br />
The principal town and county-seat is Hagerstown,<br />
a city of about 6,000 inhabitants, which is an agree-<br />
able city abounding with good fare from the sur-<br />
rounding fertile country. Other considerable towns<br />
are Williamsport and Hancock, on the Potomae,<br />
Boonsborough, Funkstown, Leitersburg, and Clear-<br />
spring, with a number of still smaller villages.<br /><br />
WICOMICO COUNTY * was formed in the fall<br />
of 1867 out of portions of Somerset and Worcester<br />
counties, in accordance with Article 18th of the<br />
Constitution of the State of Maryland, adopted in<br />
that year,—the districts of Barren Creek, Quantico,<br />
Salisbury, Sharptown, Trappe, and Tyaskin being<br />
taken from Somerset County, and Parsons, Nutter,<br />
Pittsburgh, and Dennis from Worcester County.<br />
The boundaries are as follows, namely: Beginning<br />
at the point where the Mason and Dixon’s line<br />
crosses the channel of the Pocomoke River; thence<br />
following the said line to the channel of the Nanticoke<br />
River ; thence with the channel of said river to Tan-<br />
gier Sound, or the intersection of the Nanticoke and<br />
Wicomico rivers; thence up the channel of the Wi-<br />
comico River to the mouth of Wicomico Creek;<br />
thence with the channel of said creek and Casser-<br />
dyke Creek to Dashields, or Desharoon’s Mills;<br />
thence with the mill-pond of said mills and follow-<br />
ing the middle prong of the mill branch to Meadow<br />
Bridge, on the road dividing Somerset and Worces-<br />
ter counties, near the south-west corner of Wm. S.<br />
Morris’s farm; thence due east to the Pocomoke<br />
River; thence with the channel of said river to the<br />
beginning. The surface of the county is level. The<br />
soil is various, being composed of clay, heavy black<br />
loarn, and a light sandy soil. The principal crops are<br />
corn, wheat, and oats. The soil is adapted to the<br />
raising of fruits of all kinds. In the upper section<br />
of the county, bordering on the Eastern Shore and<br />
Worcester and Pocomoke railroads, strawberries<br />
and other small fruits are raised in abundance, —<br />
strawberries being the principal and the best-paying<br />
crop, many persons realizing three hundred dollars<br />
per acre clear; the variety cultivated is the ¢« Wil-<br />
son’s Albany.”<br /><br />
The inhabitants of the southernmost district of the<br />
county cultivate water-melons largely, realizing very<br />
handsome profits. The melons are sent by vessels<br />
to Boston, New York, and other cities. The county<br />
has extensive beds of oysters, which furnish employ-<br />
ment to a great number of her citizens throughout<br />
the year, except from the 15th day of May to the<br />
15th day of September, when they are not allowed<br />
to be taken in order to protect the beds.<br /><br />
The county-seat, Salisbury, is situated at the head<br />
of Wicomico River, on the Eastern Shore Railroad,<br />
and is the principal business town on the shore, car-<br />
rying on a large and flourishing trade in corn and<br />
lumber with Baltimore and other places.<br /><br />

At present, freight has to be carried down in<br />
lighters or scows to the anchorage, about one mile<br />
below the town, and then loaded in vessels. DBut<br />
soon vessels are expected to load at the wharves,<br />
Congress having made an appropriation to improve<br />
the navigation of the river. The town has about<br />
2,500 inhabitants. Trappe district is the birthplace<br />

WORCESTER COUNTY, organized in 1742,<br />
occupies the extreme south-eastern corner of the<br />
State, and comprises the entire front on the Atlantic<br />
Occan of about thirty-three miles from Delaware to<br />
Virginia, and is bounded on the north by Wicomico<br />
County and the State of Delaware, east by the ocean,<br />
south by the ocean and Virginia, and west by Som-<br />
erset and Wicomico counties, from the latter of<br />
which it is separated by the Pocomoke River. The<br />
ocean beach of the county is a narrow sand bar<br />
thrown up by the surf, of a width varying from a<br />
few yards to over a quarter of a mile; between that<br />
bar and the mainland are large connected bodies of<br />
shoal water, known as Assawoman, Isle of Wight,<br />
and Sinepuxent bays, and the upper part of Chin-<br />
coteague Sound. There is now no connection be-<br />
tween this water and the ocean, the last inlet having<br />
been closed of late years by the action of the water.<br />
Into these waters flows all the Eastern drainage of<br />
the county, whilst that west of a slight central ridge<br />
flows into the Pocomoke River. This county ranks<br />
with the larger ones in area, but has many very<br />
large bodies of uncultivated lands, and rather a<br />
sparse population.<br /><br />
A considerable portion of the great cypress swamp<br />
in the southern portion of Declaware formerly ex-<br />
tended into the upper part of this county, but it<br />
has all been reclaimed but about 4,000 or 5,000 acres,<br />
the former swamp lands being now exceedingly pro-<br />
ductive farms.<br /><br />
The prevailing soil is sand mixed with red and<br />
white clay. Bog iron-ore exists in numerous locali-<br />
ties. Besides marsh, muck, and peat, the county has<br />
a large supply of oyster-shell lime. Shell deposits<br />
are found covering several acres in extent, and some-<br />
times to a depth of several feet.<br /><br />
Worcester is almost entirely an agricultural<br />
county, and the productions are principally corn,<br />
oats, and potatoes, with immense quantities of oys-<br />
ters. Sweet potatoes are a considerable crop, and<br />
yield very abundantly. Fruits are being cultivated<br />
of late, and peaches and grapes do very well. The<br />
climate being much tempered by the ocean air, is<br />
mild, and permits the cultivation of many fruits and<br />
tender vegetables in the open air which cannot<br />
withstand the severe winters of more northern lati-<br />
tudes; besides producing strawberries and many<br />
other market products about ten days earlier than<br />
in the upper counties, bringing the highest price and<br />
largest profits.<br /><br />
- This county, in common with the surrounding<br />
country, possesses a large share of the finest oyster-<br />
beds, and feeding-ground for vast flocks of wild<br />
fowl, ducks, brant, etc. The amount of home-made<br />
manufactures of wool and cotton were greater here<br />
in 1860 than in any other county.<br /><br />
The county-seat is Snow Hill, situated at the head<br />
of navigation on the Pocomoke River, and having a<br />
population of about 1,000. Newtown, also on the<br />
Pocomoke River, about eighteen miles above its<br />
mouth, is a very thriving town of about 1,200 inhab-<br />
itants. This town has grown very rapidly of late,<br /><br />
owing to an enterprising spirit among its population.<br /><br />
Berlin, in the upper part of the county, is also a<br />
considerable town of about nine hundred inhab-<br />
itants.<br /><br />

GENERAL DESCRIPTION.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
of wealth, of Somerset County, is in its inexhausti-<br />
ble oyster-beds, which are unexcelled in their quality<br />
by any country known. These include the greater<br />
part of the Tangier Sound, which produces the fa-<br />
mous Tangier oysters. The oyster trade employs a<br />
very large portion of the population on the islands<br />
and shores of the Sound and rivers. Fish and wild<br />
fowl are also abundant.<br />
<br />
The county town is Princess Anne, situated near<br />
the head of Manokin River, which town has about<br />
1,000 inhabitants.<br />
<br />
TALBOT COUNTY occupies a central position<br />
among the Eastern Shore counties, being immedi-<br />
ately on the bay shore, and bounded southerly and<br />
south-easterly by the Choptank River and Tuckahoe<br />
Creek, the former separating it from Dorchester,<br />
and the latter from Caroline County. It is bounded<br />
on the North by Queen Anne, which is partly sepa-<br />
rated from it by Wye River.<br />
<br />
Seven-eighths of the outline of Talbot is bounded<br />
by navigable waters, and it has also running inland<br />
Third Haven, Harris, and Broad creeks, and St. Mi-<br />
chael’s and Miles’ rivers, dividing it into peninsulas<br />
or necks, and several considerable islands, so that<br />
three-fourths of the farms have navigable water at<br />
their very doors, and of the balance the farthest is<br />
not five miles from a landing.<br />
<br />
Talbot has a healthy, mild climate (being tem-<br />
pered by the surrounding waters), and is considered<br />
by its enterprising citizens as the garden spot of<br />
this section.<br />
<br />
The soil in the upper part is loamy with a red<br />
clay sub-soil, and the lower part principally ¢ white<br />
oak.” - Both sections are fertile and very productive<br />
in grains and fruits. Deposits of shell marl are very<br />
large and numerous, and also the green sand marl,<br />
similar to that found in New Jersey. The county<br />
produces excellent crops of wheat, corn, oats, Irish<br />
and sweet potatoes, and latterly peaches are becom-<br />
ing a leading production, and no doubt yield a large<br />
profit, the climate being highly favorable to their<br />
growth ; also considerable sorghum, flax, butter, and<br />
honey have been made of late.<br />
<br />
The finest fish, oysters, and wild fowl are abun-<br />
dant.<br />
<br />
Easton, the county-seat, is situated near the head-<br />
waters of Third Haven Creek. St. Michael’s is<br />
another very pleasant village, lying on the river of<br />
the same name. The only other town of impor-<br />
tance is Oxford, at the mouth of Third Haven Creek,<br />
and which is the termination of the Maryland and<br />
Delaware Railroad, now completed to Haston, the<br />
county-seat.<br />
<br />
WASHINGTON COUNTY is situated in the<br />
western part of the State, and bounded on the north<br />
by Pennsylvania, east by the Blue Ridge or South<br />
Mountains, separating it from Frederick County,<br />
south and south-westerly by the Potomac River, and<br />
~ on the west by Alleghany County.<br />
<br />
The surface of the county is partly mountainous,<br />
being crossed by a number of ridges, between which,<br />
however, are several fine broad valleys, drained by<br />
Antietam, Conococheague, and Israel creeks. The<br />
minerals of the county have not been much devel-<br />
oped. The principal rocks are limestone and slate.<br />
Iron ore is known to exist in abundance in several<br />
localities, and limestone in immense quantities. Hy-<br />
draulic cement is found near Hancock, and below<br />
Williamsport is a hard calcareous slate, which splits<br />
into parallel layers, and takes a fine polish, and is<br />
very durable. Emery (corundum) is found near the<br />
Antietam.<br />
<br />
The soil is principally limestone, with some slate<br />
and white-oak land.<br />
<br />
In the eastern part of the county is the great<br />
valley of the Antietam Creek, commonly called the<br />
Hagerstown Valley, that town occupying a central<br />
position therein. This valley is mostly limestone<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
land, which is unusually productive, and gives crops<br />
of wheat and other grains unexcelled by any por-<br />
tion of the State. The wheat is equally fine in<br />
quality as in quantity, and is manufactured into<br />
excellent flour, there being a large number of mill<br />
seats, improved by fine merchant flour-mills.<br />
<br />
This valley has been made famous by the military<br />
operations of the great contending armies during the<br />
war just closed, and also suffered very largely from<br />
these operations. The great battle of Antietam was<br />
fought by the two armies, with columns stretching<br />
north and south on either side and facing the town<br />
of Sharpsburg. So great is the natural wealth and<br />
comparative power of this valley, and the industry<br />
of the people, that but few traces can now be seen<br />
of the damage then done. This county ranks with<br />
the most productive and best populated, although<br />
not very well supplied heretofore with transporting<br />
facilities, excepting good roads. The Chesapeake<br />
and Ohio Canal follows the entire border on the Po-<br />
tomac River, and from Hagerstown the Franklin<br />
Railroad runs northerly into Pennsylvania.<br />
<br />
The principal town and county-seat is Hagerstown,<br />
a city of about 6,000 inhabitants, which is an agree-<br />
able city abounding with good fare from the sur-<br />
rounding fertile country. Other considerable towns<br />
are Williamsport and Hancock, on the Potomae,<br />
Boonsborough, Funkstown, Leitersburg, and Clear-<br />
spring, with a number of still smaller villages.<br />
<br />
WICOMICO COUNTY * was formed in the fall<br />
of 1867 out of portions of Somerset and Worcester<br />
counties, in accordance with Article 18th of the<br />
Constitution of the State of Maryland, adopted in<br />
that year,—the districts of Barren Creek, Quantico,<br />
Salisbury, Sharptown, Trappe, and Tyaskin being<br />
taken from Somerset County, and Parsons, Nutter,<br />
Pittsburgh, and Dennis from Worcester County.<br />
The boundaries are as follows, namely: Beginning<br />
at the point where the Mason and Dixon’s line<br />
crosses the channel of the Pocomoke River; thence<br />
following the said line to the channel of the Nanticoke<br />
River ; thence with the channel of said river to Tan-<br />
gier Sound, or the intersection of the Nanticoke and<br />
Wicomico rivers; thence up the channel of the Wi-<br />
comico River to the mouth of Wicomico Creek;<br />

HISTORY.<br /><br />
——0-0p 00—<br /><br />
THE State of Maryland was one of the British<br /><br />
colonies, and original thirteen States of the<br />
American Union, and occupies the most central po-<br />
sition on the seaboard, nearly surrounding the Na-<br />
tional Capital.<br /><br />
The first settlement in Maryland was made in 1631<br />
upon Kent Island, by William Claiborne and some<br />
followers, who took possession of that region. In<br />
the following year, a grant was made by Charles L<br />
of England, to Lord Baltimore, of lands covering an<br />
area even larger than the present limits of the State.<br />
A permanent settlement was made and government<br />
established at St. Mary’s, on the river and in the<br />
county of the same name, at the head of which col-<br />
ony was Leonard Calvert, the brother of the Propri-<br />
etary. The name of Maryland (Terra Marize) was<br />
given in honor of the queen of the reigning mon-<br />
arch, Charles I. The first settlers were Catholic<br />
refugees. The settlers on Kent Island refused alle-<br />
giance, and gave some trouble, but were finally<br />
brought into subjection to the Proprietary’s govern-<br />
ment. The colony in its younger days underwent<br />
many changes, the Proprietary being displaced at<br />
times, and the British government appointing gov-<br />
ernors. In 1691, the British king, who had assumed<br />
control of the colony, appointed Sir Lionel Copley<br />
governor, and one of the first acts of his government<br />
was the removal of the seat of government from<br />
St. Mary’s to the town of Providence, from that time<br />
called Annapolis, where it has ever since remained.<br />
In this locality was concentrated the Puritan ele-<br />
ment, which had now gained the ascendancy.<br /><br />
In 1715, the government was again and finally<br />
restored to the Proprietary, the principal obstacle to<br />
the recognition of the family rights being removed<br />
by the fact of their having been educated in the faith<br />
of the establizhed “ Church of England.” The pop-<br />
ulation was then about 80,600, and at this time and<br />
very many years succeeding, tobacco was almost the<br />
only production, and was also used as a currency for<br />
various purposes, and mostly in trade. In 1745, the<br />
first and for a long time the only newspaper in the<br />
colony, the “ Maryland Gazette,” was published at<br />
Annapolis. In 1748, the population was estimated<br />
at 130,000, of which 94,000 were white, and 36,000<br />
colored. In the contest which annihilated the French<br />
dominion in America, Maryland took an active part.<br /><br />
The unfortunate expedition of Braddock against<br />
Fort Duquesne was organized in this Province, and<br />
marched from Frederick in 1754. In the Revolu-<br /><br />
- tion, Maryland also occupied a leading position, par-<br /><br />
ticipating early and strenuously in all the move-<br />
ments of that period. The province expended nearly<br />
$8,000,000 and furnished over 20,000 men to the<br />
armies. At the close of the war, Congress met in<br />
the State House at Annapolis, and the Senate cham-<br />
ber of that vencrable edifice (which is still un-<br />
changed) became inseparably connected with the<br />
history of that epoch, by the resignation therein of<br />
his commission as commander-in-chief of the armies,<br />
by George Washington.<br /><br />
In the war with Great Britain in 1812 and 1815,<br />
many important movements of the British on land<br />
and water took place in this State. In 1813, the vil-<br />
lages of Frenchtown, Havre de Grace, Frederick-<br />
town, and Georgetown, about the head of the Bay,<br />
were plundered and burned by the naval force of<br />
Admiral Cockburn, which traversed the Chesapeake.<br />
The battle of Bladensburg was fought near the town<br />
of the same name, and resulted disastrously to the<br />
American forces. In 1814, the British attempted the<br />
attack upon Baltimore city, which ended in their<br />
defeat at the battle of North Point in Patapsco<br /><br />
‘Neck, and they were also completely repulsed in<br /><br />
their direct attack on the city by Fort McHenry and<br /><br />
some small batteries on the suburbs of the town.<br />
At the November session of the Assembly in 1835,<br /><br />
an Act was passed amending the Constitution and<br /><br /><br /><br />
HISTORY.<br /><br />
form of government of the State. It gave the elec-<br />
tion of the governor to the people, instead of to two<br />
eléctors from each county as heretofore; abolished<br />
the Council to the Governor; gave one senator to<br />
each county and one to the city of Baltimore, and<br />
changed the apportionment of delegates, giving five<br />
to Baltimore and to each of two of the counties, four<br />
to each of cight of the counties, three to cach of the<br />
remaining counties, and one to Annapolis.<br /><br />
In 1851 a State Convention assembled for the pur-<br />
pose of revising the Constitution. The principal<br />
changes were: conforming the representations of<br />
the counlies more to the population,— giving Balti-<br />
more city ten; to Anmapolis, none; to two of the<br />
counties, six; to one, five; to two, four; to six,<br />
three; and to the remaining ones, two each; making<br />
the judiciary elective by the people, and making the<br />
sessions of the legislature biennial.<br /><br />
Governor Lowe was succeeded in 1854 by T. Wat-<br />
kins Ligon, Esq., of Howard County. IIe was suc-<br />
ceeded, in 1857, by Thomas Holliday Iicks, Esq.,<br />
of Dorchester County. During Governor Iicks’s<br />
term of office, the Southern States seceded from the<br />
Union.<br /><br />
The civil war virtually commenced on the 4th of<br />
March, 1861, when Gen. P. T. Beauregard took for-<br />
mal command of the Confederate forces in Charles-<br />
ton, and commenced operations for besieging Fort<br />
Sumter, which surrendered on the 13th of April fol-<br />
lowing. Although Maryland did not secede from the<br />
Union, some of the opening and most important<br />
events of the war transpired in the State, the first<br />
blood being shed in the streets of Baltimore on the<br />
19th of April, when a Massachusetts regiment pass-<br />
ing through to Washington was attacked by a mob,<br />
and two Kkilled and eight wounded.<br /><br />
For some months after, the principal seat of war<br />
being near Washington and on the Potomac border,<br />
the proximity of large bodies of troops, and the con-<br />
stant liability that the State would become the the-<br />
atre of active hostilities, had a tendency to demoral-<br />
ize all industries and keep the community in a state<br />
of excitement and alarm, which subsequent events<br />
fully justified, as Maryland was, during the war,<br />
three times invaded by the Confederate forces.<br /><br />
In 1862, Gen. Lee passed northward through Vir-<br />
ginia, forded the Potomac near the Point of Rocks<br />
on the 8d of Sept., and on the morning of Sept.<br />
6th, the advance-guard, 3,000 strong, under ¢ Stone-<br />
wall” Jackson, entered without opposition the city<br />
of Frederick. On the 8th, Gen. Lee issued a pro-<br />
clamation to the people of Maryland, urging them<br />
to secede from the Union, and assuring them of the<br />
covperation of his army to aid them in severing<br />
their connection with it. No general response was<br />
made to the appeal. :<br /><br />
At the same time, Governor Augustus W. Brad-<br />
ford, who succeeded Governor Hicks in December,<br />
1861, issued a proclamation calling upon the citizens<br />
to form suitable organizations to render effectual<br />
aid to the National Government. On the 10th, the<br />
advance of Gen. Lee’s army entered Ilagerstown,<br />
having evacuated Frederick the same day, the latter<br />
place being reached by the Union army under Gen.<br />
McClellan on the 12th.<br /><br />
Gen. Lee having dispatched a portion of his army<br />
under the command of Gen. Jackson, for the attack<br />
on Harper’s Ferry, took up a strong position with the<br />
remainder about twelve miles west of Frederick,<br />
where, on the 14th, was fought the battle of South<br />
Mountain, which was opened by an attack from the<br />
right wing of the Union army under Gen. Hooker,<br />
and, after a sharply contested engagement which<br />
lasted throughout the day, the Confederate forces re-<br />
treated in the direction of the Potomac, and concen-<br />
trated at Sharpsburg, near Antietam Creek, where<br />
they were rejoined by Gen. Jackson, who had, on the<br />
15th, captured Harper’s Ferry with 11,000 prisoners.<br /><br />
Here, at daylight on the 17th of September, com-<br />
menced the battle of ¢ Antietam,” one of the most<br />
destructive engagements of the war, nearly 30,000<br /><br /><br /><br />
11<br /><br />
men being killed or wounded. About 200,000<br />
men were engaged, with 500 pieces of artillery, the<br />
fight continuing until the combatants were separated<br />
by the darkness of the night. The tide of battle<br />
swayed with varying results during the day, nearly<br />
all the ground upon which it was fought being taken<br />
and retaken in turn. Both armies slept upon the<br />
field, expecting to renew the fight on the morning<br />
of the 18th. The Confederate army, however, re-<br />
tired from their position, and crossed the Potomac<br />
into Virginia, abandoning every place they had occu-<br />
pied north of the river, including Harper’s Ferry.<br /><br />
On the 10th and 11th of October following, Gen.<br />
J. E. B. Stewart, with a force of 2,000 Confederate<br />
cavalry, made a daring raid across the State, reach-<br />
ing Chambersburg, P’a., where he burnt all the<br />
Government property, supplied himself with fresh<br />
horses, and, after capturing a large amount of stores<br />
and supplies, passed rapidly around the Union army<br />
in Maryland, and crossed the Potomac into Virginia.<br /><br />
On the 14th of June, 1863, Gen. Lee again crossed<br />
the Potomac and advanced upon Hagerstown, ex-<br />
tending his army through the border counties of<br />
Maryland and Pennsylvania to Chambersburg, Car-<br />
lisle, etc. The armies finally concentrated near<br />
Gettysburg, a small town in Adams County, Pa.,<br />
114 miles west of Philadelphia, and 75 north of<br />
‘Washington.<br /><br />
Here, on the 1st, 2d, and 3d of July, was fought a<br />
great battle between the entire army of Gen. Lee, and<br />
the army of the Potomac under Gen. Meade, which<br />
resulted in the defeat of the Confederate forces, and<br />
a joint loss of about 48,000 men, killed or wounded.<br /><br />
In July, 1864, Gen. Early, with a force of 22,000<br />
men, crossed the Potomac into Maryland, above<br />
Harper’s Ferry, marched upon Hagerstown, and<br />
took possession of that place. To save the city of<br />
Frederick from burning, the sum of two hundred<br />
thousand dollars was paid to General Early; and<br />
nearly one hundred thousand dollars was paid to<br />
McCausland, in money and goods, by the citizens of<br />
Hagerstown.<br /><br />
Passing on towards Baltimore, he was met on the<br />
9th of July by Gen. Lewis Wallace, at Monocacy,<br />
where a severe engagement was had without check-<br />
ing his advance, and the next day he took possession<br />
of Fredericktown. For four days his army was en-<br />
gaged in plundering the people of Maryland, passing<br />
at one time to within six miles of Washington, cutting<br />
the railroad and telegraphic communication with the<br />
North, and threatening the Capital itself. On the 13th<br />
he recrossed the Potomac with an immense amount<br />
of booty, and made his way back to Richmond.<br /><br />
In April, 1864, a convention was held for a further<br />
revision of the State Constitution. By this conven-<br />
tion a registration of voters was provided for; the<br />
principle of representation according to population<br />
was adopted; to Baltimore City were given three<br />
senators and eighteen representatives; to each county<br />
one senator; to two counties six representatives; to<br />
two, five; to two, four; to two, three; to two, eight;<br />
and to four, one; the power of appointing magis-<br />
trates was restored to the Governor; and a State<br />
Board of Education was created, consisting of the<br />
Governor, the Lieutenant-Governor, the Speaker of<br />
the Iouse of Delegates, and the State Superinten-<br />
dent of Education.<br /><br />
Besides these changes, it was declared — Article<br />
24th, Declaration of Rights—¢that hereafter, in this<br />
State, there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary<br />
gervitude, except in punishment of crime whereof<br />
the party shall have been duly convicted; and all<br />
persons held to service or labor as slaves are hereby<br />
declared free.”<br /><br />
Since the close of the Civil War, the advance of<br />
Maryland in all material interests has been rapid.<br />
An entire change in the system of labor, and the<br />
establishment of free schools, have largely increased<br />

HISTORY.<br />
<br />
——0-0p 00—<br />
<br />
THE State of Maryland was one of the British<br />
<br />
colonies, and original thirteen States of the<br />
American Union, and occupies the most central po-<br />
sition on the seaboard, nearly surrounding the Na-<br />
tional Capital.<br />
<br />
The first settlement in Maryland was made in 1631<br />
upon Kent Island, by William Claiborne and some<br />
followers, who took possession of that region. In<br />
the following year, a grant was made by Charles L<br />
of England, to Lord Baltimore, of lands covering an<br />
area even larger than the present limits of the State.<br />
A permanent settlement was made and government<br />
established at St. Mary’s, on the river and in the<br />
county of the same name, at the head of which col-<br />
ony was Leonard Calvert, the brother of the Propri-<br />
etary. The name of Maryland (Terra Marize) was<br />
given in honor of the queen of the reigning mon-<br />
arch, Charles I. The first settlers were Catholic<br />
refugees. The settlers on Kent Island refused alle-<br />
giance, and gave some trouble, but were finally<br />
brought into subjection to the Proprietary’s govern-<br />
ment. The colony in its younger days underwent<br />
many changes, the Proprietary being displaced at<br />
times, and the British government appointing gov-<br />
ernors. In 1691, the British king, who had assumed<br />
control of the colony, appointed Sir Lionel Copley<br />
governor, and one of the first acts of his government<br />
was the removal of the seat of government from<br />
St. Mary’s to the town of Providence, from that time<br />
called Annapolis, where it has ever since remained.<br />
In this locality was concentrated the Puritan ele-<br />
ment, which had now gained the ascendancy.<br />
<br />
In 1715, the government was again and finally<br />
restored to the Proprietary, the principal obstacle to<br />
the recognition of the family rights being removed<br />
by the fact of their having been educated in the faith<br />
of the establizhed “ Church of England.” The pop-<br />
ulation was then about 80,600, and at this time and<br />
very many years succeeding, tobacco was almost the<br />
only production, and was also used as a currency for<br />
various purposes, and mostly in trade. In 1745, the<br />
first and for a long time the only newspaper in the<br />
colony, the “ Maryland Gazette,” was published at<br />
Annapolis. In 1748, the population was estimated<br />
at 130,000, of which 94,000 were white, and 36,000<br />
colored. In the contest which annihilated the French<br />
dominion in America, Maryland took an active part.<br />
<br />
The unfortunate expedition of Braddock against<br />
Fort Duquesne was organized in this Province, and<br />
marched from Frederick in 1754. In the Revolu-<br />
<br />
- tion, Maryland also occupied a leading position, par-<br />
<br />
ticipating early and strenuously in all the move-<br />
ments of that period. The province expended nearly<br />
$8,000,000 and furnished over 20,000 men to the<br />
armies. At the close of the war, Congress met in<br />
the State House at Annapolis, and the Senate cham-<br />
ber of that vencrable edifice (which is still un-<br />
changed) became inseparably connected with the<br />
history of that epoch, by the resignation therein of<br />
his commission as commander-in-chief of the armies,<br />
by George Washington.<br />
<br />
In the war with Great Britain in 1812 and 1815,<br />
many important movements of the British on land<br />
and water took place in this State. In 1813, the vil-<br />
lages of Frenchtown, Havre de Grace, Frederick-<br />
town, and Georgetown, about the head of the Bay,<br />
were plundered and burned by the naval force of<br />
Admiral Cockburn, which traversed the Chesapeake.<br />
The battle of Bladensburg was fought near the town<br />
of the same name, and resulted disastrously to the<br />
American forces. In 1814, the British attempted the<br />
attack upon Baltimore city, which ended in their<br />
defeat at the battle of North Point in Patapsco<br />
<br />
‘Neck, and they were also completely repulsed in<br />
<br />
their direct attack on the city by Fort McHenry and<br />
<br />
some small batteries on the suburbs of the town.<br />
At the November session of the Assembly in 1835,<br />
<br />
an Act was passed amending the Constitution and<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
HISTORY.<br />
<br />
form of government of the State. It gave the elec-<br />
tion of the governor to the people, instead of to two<br />
eléctors from each county as heretofore; abolished<br />
the Council to the Governor; gave one senator to<br />
each county and one to the city of Baltimore, and<br />
changed the apportionment of delegates, giving five<br />
to Baltimore and to each of two of the counties, four<br />
to each of cight of the counties, three to cach of the<br />
remaining counties, and one to Annapolis.<br />
<br />
In 1851 a State Convention assembled for the pur-<br />
pose of revising the Constitution. The principal<br />
changes were: conforming the representations of<br />
the counlies more to the population,— giving Balti-<br />
more city ten; to Anmapolis, none; to two of the<br />
counties, six; to one, five; to two, four; to six,<br />
three; and to the remaining ones, two each; making<br />
the judiciary elective by the people, and making the<br />
sessions of the legislature biennial.<br />
<br />
Governor Lowe was succeeded in 1854 by T. Wat-<br />
kins Ligon, Esq., of Howard County. IIe was suc-<br />
ceeded, in 1857, by Thomas Holliday Iicks, Esq.,<br />
of Dorchester County. During Governor Iicks’s<br />
term of office, the Southern States seceded from the<br />
Union.<br />
<br />
The civil war virtually commenced on the 4th of<br />
March, 1861, when Gen. P. T. Beauregard took for-<br />
mal command of the Confederate forces in Charles-<br />
ton, and commenced operations for besieging Fort<br />
Sumter, which surrendered on the 13th of April fol-<br />
lowing. Although Maryland did not secede from the<br />
Union, some of the opening and most important<br />
events of the war transpired in the State, the first<br />
blood being shed in the streets of Baltimore on the<br />
19th of April, when a Massachusetts regiment pass-<br />
ing through to Washington was attacked by a mob,<br />
and two Kkilled and eight wounded.<br />

IN the present day there are few who will refuse<br />
their assent to the proposition, that the character<br />
of the industrial operations of every country de-<br />
pends for the most part upon its geological forma-<br />
tion, modified of course by climate. It is equally<br />
certain that, in connection with climate, the geologi-<br />
cal structure and mineral components of any region<br />
determine the character and the fertility of its soils.<br />
The mineral masses which constitute our planet con-<br />
sist of many different kinds of rocks, clays, sands,<br />
and other matters containing several substances es-<br />
sential to the growth of plants. Among these are<br />
silica, alumina, lime, magnesia, potash, soda, oxide<br />
of iron, phosphoric and sulphuric acids, chlorine,<br />
and other substances which exist, or portions of<br />
them, in much larger proportions in certain kinds<br />
of rocks than in others; whilst there are rocks in<br />
which matters essential to plants are so firmly united<br />
together and to other substances, that they are very<br />
slowly liberated for the wants of vegetation.<br /><br />
At and near the surface of the earth atmospherie<br />
agencies are incessantly disintegrating and decom-<br />
posing the rocks and other mineral substances. The<br />
resulting products remain in part, and form an<br />
earthy covering. Portions, however, are dissolved,<br />
and assistin furnishing the mineral matters in spring<br />
water; whilst others are washed off during heavy<br />
falls of rain, and deposited in lower places or carried<br />
into streams and to the ocean. What we term soil<br />
is that portion of this earthy covering lying at and<br />
near the surface, and more or less mixed up with<br />
the remains of plants and animals that have died<br />
thereon.<br /><br />
From the following description of the rocks found<br />
in Maryland, the nature of the soil in different<br />
parts of the State is easily determined, as some of<br />
them abound in properties required by plants, which<br />
in others are either deficient or entirely wanting.<br /><br />

A prominent feature in the geology of Maryland<br />
is, that most of the formations exist in nearly paral-<br />
lel ranges whose course is about N.E. by N.; passing<br /><br />

into Pennsylvania on the north and into Virginia on<br />
the south and west.<br /><br />
Most of them, as shown in the map, constitute<br />
narrow belts, and the Sections will assist in showing<br />
why this is the case. They were doubtless deposited<br />
one upon the other in succession, and afterwards up-<br />
heaved by forces from below, which appear to have<br />
acted along lines nearly coincident with their range<br />
or strike, as it is usually termed. These upheaving<br />
forces seem to have acted most frequently and with<br />
the greatest energy upon the metamorphic rocks 5<br />
and 6, and with somewhat less energy upon the for-<br />
mations numbered 8 to 12, which extend westward to<br />
the North Mountain. When we examine the strati-<br />
fication of the rocks from 13 upwards, we have evi-<br />
dence of less disturbance as we proceed westward.<br /><br />
Since the deposit of the coal formations westward<br />
of Dan’s Mountain, the upheaval secems to have<br />
taken place, with more uniform force, over large<br />
areas. The resultis, therefore, that whilst elevations<br />
of more than 3,000 feet have taken place in some<br />
of the ridges, the strata are not generally turned up<br />
at such high angles, nor are they so much plicated<br />
or broken as in the older rocks.<br /><br />
FORMATION Nos. 1to 5.<br /><br />
Gneiss, Mica Slate, and Hornblende Slate, including the<br />
Intrusive Rocks 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a portion of the<br />
Limestone No. 11.<br /><br />
The south-western limits of these rocks above the<br />
tide-level are at the head of tide-water upon most of<br />
the streams crossed by the old post-road from Elkton<br />
via Havre de Grace, and Baltimore to Washington.<br /><br />
Along this line it passes under the cretaceous<br />
clays 21 and 22. It constitutes a belt varying in<br />
width from 12 to 20 miles, and extending through<br />
portions of Cecil, Harford, Baltimore, Howard, and<br />
Montgomery counties, and is bounded on the north-<br />
west by Talcose slates (6), or, more correctly speak-<br />
ing, it seems to pass into that formation by insensible<br />
shades of difference. Nearest the south-western<br />
limits the prevailing rock is gneiss, with occasional<br />
intercalations of mica-slate, and still more of horn-<br />
blende slate. The proportion of gneiss is greatest<br />
in Baltimore County.<br /><br />
Mica slate increases in quantity as we proceed<br />
north-west, and in Montgomery County it is a pre-<br />
vailing rock. The intercalations of hornblende<br />
slate are more abundant in the gneiss than in the<br />
mica slate.<br /><br />
The metamorphic limestones No. 11, which exist<br />
in this range, are confined to Harford, Baltimore,<br />
and Howard, and include several minor ranges of<br />
dolomite. They are associated with a certain kind<br />
of mica slate which is continuous into Montgomery<br />
County.<br /><br />
In some portions of the mica slate we find garnets,<br />
staurotide, and cyanite disseminated in considerable<br />
quantity; and as these minerals are very slowly<br />
acted upon by atmospheric agents, the rock decays<br />
very slowly; and when they form a large proportion<br />
of the mass, furnish a light barren soil.<br /><br />
FORMATION Nos. 6 and 7.<br />
Talcose Slate, including Roofing-slate.<br /><br />
This formation occupies a small area in the north-<br />
west part of Harford, and thence ranges through<br />
Baltimore, Carroll, Howard, and Montgomery coun-<br />
ties in a wide belt. With the exception of the<br />
south-eastern edge (which may be included within<br />
the metalliferous range, or the borders of No. 5),<br />
this formation is singularly destitute of minerals<br />
other than the rock itself, until we cross the summit<br />
at Parr’s ridge.<br /><br />
The metamorphic limestones, between Parr’s ridge<br />
and the western limit of No. 6, differ materially from<br />
those in No. 5. The latter, with the exception of the<br />
“alum limestone ” (which occupies a small area in<br />
Baltimore County), is generally much mixed up with<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
o S, ks<br /><br />
small grains of quartz, mica, tale, and other min-<br />
erals. The former, however, is remarkable for its<br />
purity, and has a fine grain, and in some of the<br />
quarries there are ledges much resembling statuary<br />
marble.<br /><br />
It seems, however, that those in the same range,<br />
between Liberty and the railroad near New. Market,<br />
have been more fully metamorphosed, and are less<br />
pure. These limestones do not constitute continuous<br />
belts, but interrupted ledges, varying in length from<br />
a few hundred yards to several miles, and constitute<br />
an important element in the agriculture of that region.<br /><br />
The rocks so far enumerated contain no remains<br />
of animal and vegetable life. Those which follow<br />
contain such remains, and are therefore supposed to<br />
have been formed since organic life began on our<br />
globe.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 8.<br /><br />
(LPrimal of Pennsylvania Survey.) Polisdam Sandstone<br />
of New York.<br /><br />
This division includes—<br /><br />
1. A hard sandstone made up of grains of quartz,<br />
with occasionally grains of feldspar and kaolin. The<br />
silicious cement seems to have completely filled up<br />
the interstices between the grains, so as to give a<br />
firm, compact structure to the rock. Portions of<br />
this rock seem to have been subjected to such<br />
changes as to render it doubtful whether it should<br />
not be considered as granular quartz, and be classed<br />
among the metamorphic rocks. Vegetable life seems<br />
to have commenced at the period of the formation<br />
of this rock, because it contains fossilized stems of<br />
plants. :<br /><br />
2. A slate varying in color from gray to brownish<br />
and greenish. It is ranked as an argillite, but por-<br />
tions of it assume a marked talcose appearance,<br />
especially in the Catoctin Mountain and in parts of<br />
Middletown Valley, where it has been much dis-<br />
turbed and altered by proximity to intrusive rocks.<br />
These last consist of amphibolites (trap), porphyries,<br />
amygdaloid, serpentine, and epidote.  This last-<br />
named rock is extensively developed both in large<br />
masses and intercalated between the slates, and has<br />
largely contributed to produce the highly fertile soil<br />
of Middletown Valley.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 10.<br /><br />
Auroral series of the Pennsylvania Reports. Chazy and<br />
Black River Limestones of New York.<br /><br />
This constitutes the most extensive limestone for-<br />
mation of the United States or in the world, its<br />
entire length being over 600 miles. A small area<br />
of it occurs in Frederick County near the Monocacy<br />
River, reaching from the Potomac to a point north<br />
of Woodsboro’, where it is covered by the mezozoic<br />
or new red sandstone. Between the South and<br />
North mountains, in the Hagerstown Valley, it is<br />
developed to the extent of more than three-fourths<br />
the area of the part of that fine valley within our<br />
limits. The soil resting upon this formation is<br />
among the best in the State.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 11.<br />
Metamorphic Limestones.<br /><br />
There are two ranges of these in Maryland, both<br />
of which have been noticed: 1st. In the gneiss and<br />
mica slates. 2d. In the western parts of the talcose<br />
slates of Carroll and Frederick counties.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 12.<br /><br />
Matinal Series in the Pennsylvania Reports, Hudson<br />
River Slates, Utica Slate, and Trenton Limestone in<br />
the New York Reports.<br /><br />
This formation occurs in Maryland only on the<br />
western side of the Hagerstown Valley, and although<br />
the soil it produces is naturally less fertile than the<br />
adjacent limestone, it can be readily made productive<br />
if judiciously treated.<br /><br />

——oot@300—<br />
<br />
IN the present day there are few who will refuse<br />
their assent to the proposition, that the character<br />
of the industrial operations of every country de-<br />
pends for the most part upon its geological forma-<br />
tion, modified of course by climate. It is equally<br />
certain that, in connection with climate, the geologi-<br />
cal structure and mineral components of any region<br />
determine the character and the fertility of its soils.<br />
The mineral masses which constitute our planet con-<br />
sist of many different kinds of rocks, clays, sands,<br />
and other matters containing several substances es-<br />
sential to the growth of plants. Among these are<br />
silica, alumina, lime, magnesia, potash, soda, oxide<br />
of iron, phosphoric and sulphuric acids, chlorine,<br />
and other substances which exist, or portions of<br />
them, in much larger proportions in certain kinds<br />
of rocks than in others; whilst there are rocks in<br />
which matters essential to plants are so firmly united<br />
together and to other substances, that they are very<br />
slowly liberated for the wants of vegetation.<br />
<br />
At and near the surface of the earth atmospherie<br />
agencies are incessantly disintegrating and decom-<br />
posing the rocks and other mineral substances. The<br />
resulting products remain in part, and form an<br />
earthy covering. Portions, however, are dissolved,<br />
and assistin furnishing the mineral matters in spring<br />
water; whilst others are washed off during heavy<br />
falls of rain, and deposited in lower places or carried<br />
into streams and to the ocean. What we term soil<br />
is that portion of this earthy covering lying at and<br />
near the surface, and more or less mixed up with<br />
the remains of plants and animals that have died<br />
thereon.<br />
<br />
From the following description of the rocks found<br />
in Maryland, the nature of the soil in different<br />
parts of the State is easily determined, as some of<br />
them abound in properties required by plants, which<br />
in others are either deficient or entirely wanting.<br />

FORMATION No. 13.<br /><br />
Levant Series of the Pennsylvania Reports. Oneida Con-<br />
glomerate and Medina Sandstone of the New York<br />
Reports.<br /><br />
These rocks form the summits of the North Moun-<br />
tain, Tonaloway Hill, and Will’s Mountain, and<br />
from thence dip under Dan’s Mountain, and do not<br />
again rise to the surface in Maryland.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 14a.<br /><br />
Surgent Series of the Pennsylvania Reports. Clinton<br />
Group of the New York Reports.<br /><br />
The importance of this group is owing to its valu-<br />
able beds of iron-ore. It consists of —<br /><br />
1. A series of olive, brown, and yellowish slates,<br />
with some sandy layers. Some of them assume a<br />
claret color by exposure. It contains fossil stems.<br /><br />
2. Iron sandstone, alternating with a greenish<br />
sandy shale. Some of the layers contain sufficient<br />
iron to be worked. They are of a dark reddish-<br />
brown color.<br /><br />
8. Upper shale of a greenish color, which by ex-<br />
posure changes to a buff-color, and sometimes to a<br />
brown and brownish-red.<br /><br />
4. Lower ore shale, greenish, with layers of lime-<br />
stone. :<br /><br />
5. A gray calcareous sandstone in thin layers.<br /><br />
6. The upper ore shale consists of bluish and<br />
greenish shales, with alternations of thin beds of<br />
both pure and shaly limestone, and some beds of cal-<br />
careous sandstone. The lower part of this shale<br />
contains, on both flanks of Will’s Mountain, two,<br />
and sometimes three, beds of what is called the<br />
fossiliferous iron-ore, which continues through both<br />
Pennsylvania and Virginia, and is largely used in<br />
the furnaces in the former State.<br /><br />
7. A thick mass of red shales, sometimes slightly<br />
calcareous. A reference to the section will show<br />
that this formation, resting upon the sandstone<br />
(No. 13), appears on the western flank of the North<br /><br />
Mountain, and in the principal valleys between that<br /><br />
and Martin’s Mountain.<br /><br />
From thence it is covered by other and more<br />
recent formations, until we reach the base of Will’s<br />
Mountain, where it crops out, and renders the fossil-<br />
iferous iron-ore accessible.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 14b4.<br /><br />
Scalent Series of the Pennsylvania Reports. Onondaga<br />
Salt Group and the Water-lime Group of the New<br />
York Reports.<br /><br />
It consists — 1. Of bluish, greenish, and red cal-<br />
careous shales, with some beds of limestone, resting<br />
upon a thick series of gray, greenish, and bluish<br />
calcareous shales, with beds of impure limestone,<br />
and seems to graduate into the cement rock above.<br /><br />
2. A blue limestone with bands of chert. It is<br />
usually in moderately thin layers, and contains a<br />
little magnesia.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 15a.<br /><br />
Pre-meridian Limestone of the Pennsylvania Reports.<br />
 Lower Helderberqg Limestone, New York Reports.<br /><br />
This limestone varies in color from gray to blue,<br />
and also varies considerably in composition. Some<br />
of the layers are very pure limestone, whilst others<br />
are shaly and silicious. It abounds in layers of chert,<br />
which, near the western base of the North Moun-<br />
tain, are of considerable thickness. It contains<br />
numerous remains of shells, as well as of corals. - It<br />
appears resting upon No. 150, near the western base<br />
of the North Mountain, and dips under No. 16. It<br />
crops out on both flanks of Tonaloway Hill, and<br />
passes under Sideling Hill, Town Hill, Ragged<br />
Mountain, Warner Mountain, and Evits Mountain,<br />
and crops out in the city of Cumberland. It is<br />
again found on the west side of Will’s Mountain,<br />
and dipping under Dan’s Mountain, again rises to<br /><br /><br /><br />
the surface in the State of Ohio,—its identity being<br />
fully established by its fossils.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 15b.<br /><br />
Meridian Series of the Pennsylvania Reports.  Oriskany<br />
Sandstone of the New York Reports.<br /><br />
The sandstone is usually of a yellowish color, has<br />
a coarse open texture, is more or less calcareous, and<br />
contains numerous fossils. It rests upon the lime-<br /><br />
 stone last described (15a).<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 16a.<br /><br />
Cadent Slates and Shales of the Pennsylvania Reports.<br />

1. A black bituminous shale.<br /><br />
2. Olive, brownish, and gray shales in some locali-<br /><br />
ties, containing thin beds of brown and gray sand-<br />
stone.<br /><br />
3. A brownish and bluish slate.<br /><br />
Among its fossils are remains of plants allied to<br />
those of the coal formation, and the lowest yet<br />
known of that kind.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 16b.<br /><br />
Vergent Series in the Pennsylvania Reports. Portage<br />
Flags and Ithaca and Chemung Groups of New<br />
York Reports.<br /><br />
It consists of —<br /><br />
1. A fine-grained sandstone (more or less argilla-<br />
ceous) in thin layers, parted by thin seams of shale,<br />
with marine fossils.<br /><br />
2. Blue, gray, and olive-colored shales, with occa-<br />
sional layers of brown and gray sandstones.<br /><br />
The rocks of this group, with those of 16a, are<br />
largely developed between Licking Creek and Han-<br />
cock, in Sideling Hill, and in all the ridges westward<br />
to Cumberland, where they crop out. They are<br />
again seen in Dan’s Mountain, near its base, dipping<br />
westward, and do not appear again in Maryland.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 17.<br /><br />
Ponent Series of the Pennsylvania Reports. Catskill<br />
Group of the New York Reports.<br /><br />
This group is the equivalent of the old red sand-<br />
stone of Europe, and consists, in Maryland, of rather<br />
soft shales, containing very few fossils, and these in<br />
a few calcareous layers. It occurs in Sideling Hill<br />
and Town Hill, and again on the east flank of Dan’s<br />
Mountain, under which it dips, and reappears on the<br />
west flank of Savage Mountain. It occupies a large<br />
portion of Alleghany County, west of Savage Moun-<br />
tain, between the three coal-basins, as will be seen<br />
by referring to the map.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 18a.<br />
Vespertine Series of the Pennsylvania Survey.<br /><br />
This group consists of greenish and olive-colored<br />
and bluish shales, with a few thick layers of dull<br />
gray sandstone. It contains remains of plants ap-<br />
proximating those of the coal formation.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 18b.<br /><br />
Umbral Series of the Pennsylvania Reports.<br /><br />
It consists principally of red shales, with some of<br />
an olive-green color. There are also occasional<br />
alternations of slaty sandstones. It contains a bed<br />
of limestone from forty to fifty feet thick, which is<br />
important from the fact that it is the only thick bed<br />
of limestone in Maryland west of Dan’s Mountain.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 19. (CoaL.)<br />
Seral Series, Pennsylvania Reports.<br /><br />
The coal formations of Maryland consist of alter-<br />
nations of —<br /><br /><br /><br />
1. Sandstones usually gray, varying from coarse<br />
to fine and shaly.<br /><br />
2. Shales usually black and bituminous, or carbon-<br />
aceous, but also gray, brownish, and olive-colored.<br /><br />
8. Slate clay or massive beds of indurated clay,<br />
with little or no fissile structure, and known by<br />
miners as fire-clay.<br /><br />
4. Bituminous coal.<br /><br />
5. Iron ores of the variety called carbonate of<br />
iron. This lies within a thin strata between the<br />
shales and fire-clays, or in flattened nodules imbed-<br />
ded therein.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 20.<br /><br />
Mezozoic Series, Penn’a Reports, New Red Sandstone<br />
of the New York Reports and of the British G'eologists.<br /><br />
The new red sandstone of Carroll, Frederick, and<br /><br />
. Montgomery counties, rests upon the metamorphic<br /><br />
and the oldest of the sedimentary rocks. It consists<br />
at its base of coarse red and brown sandstones and<br />
conglomerates, upon which rest finer-grained sand-<br />
stones, followed by red shales of considerable thick-<br />
ness, some of which are calcareous. Upon these<br />
shales is found, in the southern part of Frederick<br />
County, a coarse calcareous conglomerate or preccia<br />
of considerable thickness.<br /><br />

-FORMATION No. 21.<br /><br />
Cretaceous Group, or Chalk Period.<br /><br />
- A wide belt of this formation exists in Maryland.<br />
It consists of —<br /><br />
1. A thick group of sands and clays of various<br />
colors, but principally white, red, and bluish-gray,<br />
with some thin beds of ferruginous sandstone resting<br />
immediately upon No. 5. In some localities it<br />
abounds in lignite, derived from coniferous plants.<br />
The bluish-gray varieties derive their color from the<br />
carbonaceous remains of plants.<br /><br />
2. Iron-ore clays (No. 22). This subdivision con-<br />
sists of a series of beds of fine gray and lead-colored<br />
clays, containing several courses of carbonate of iron,<br />
in flattened nodules and masses, varying in size from<br />
a pound or two to half a ton or more in weight.<br /><br />
The following fossils have been found-in the for-<br />
mations of Maryland, namely:<br /><br />
A new genus of a Cycas, of large dimensions.<br /><br />
Silicified coniferous wood.<br /><br />
Lignites (coniferous). ;<br /><br />
A fragment of a rib of a whale of large size.<br /><br />
A part of the teeth and bones of an herbivorous<br />
Saurian, a large extinct reptile allied to the lizard,<br />
crocodile, ete.<br /><br />
In the vicinity of Baltimore are beds of moderate<br />
thickness and extent of dark grayish-colored clays,<br />
from which is manufactured brick of a very superior<br />
quality.<br /><br />
The lower green sand, constituting the upper beds<br />
of this group, consists of — ;<br /><br />
1. Green sand, more or less mixed up with silicious<br />
sand, and containing shells. :<br /><br />
2. Bluish sandy clays.<br /><br />
3. Black or dark gray micaceous sandy clay, which,<br />
in some localities, abounds with fossil shark’s teeth.<br /><br />
"" 4. Sandy limestone, or indurated marl, with nu-<br />
merous shells. This exists in irregular and inter-<br />
rupted beds, from one to four or five feet thick.<br /><br />
5. Beds of reddish and sometimes yellowish sand-<br />
stones and conglomerates, containing green particles<br />
and very few shells. They are from two or three to<br />
twenty or thirty feet in thickness.<br /><br />
6. Loose silicious or common sand, intercalated<br />
between some of the beds, but most abundant in the<br />
upper portion.<br /><br />
The formation occupies a considerable area em-<br />
bracing parts of Cecil, Kent, Harford, Baltimore,<br />
Anne Arundel, and Prince George’s counties. The<br />
soils of this formation are variable. Those of the<br />
sandy clays, with proper treatment, are productwe,<br />
while those of the stiff clays are expensive to cul-<br />
tivate.<br />","GEOLOGY.<br />

FORMATION No. 14a.<br />
<br />
Surgent Series of the Pennsylvania Reports. Clinton<br />
Group of the New York Reports.<br />
<br />
The importance of this group is owing to its valu-<br />
able beds of iron-ore. It consists of —<br />
<br />
1. A series of olive, brown, and yellowish slates,<br />
with some sandy layers. Some of them assume a<br />
claret color by exposure. It contains fossil stems.<br />
<br />
2. Iron sandstone, alternating with a greenish<br />
sandy shale. Some of the layers contain sufficient<br />
iron to be worked. They are of a dark reddish-<br />
brown color.<br />
<br />
8. Upper shale of a greenish color, which by ex-<br />
posure changes to a buff-color, and sometimes to a<br />
brown and brownish-red.<br />
<br />
4. Lower ore shale, greenish, with layers of lime-<br />
stone. :<br />
<br />
5. A gray calcareous sandstone in thin layers.<br />
<br />
6. The upper ore shale consists of bluish and<br />
greenish shales, with alternations of thin beds of<br />
both pure and shaly limestone, and some beds of cal-<br />
careous sandstone. The lower part of this shale<br />
contains, on both flanks of Will’s Mountain, two,<br />
and sometimes three, beds of what is called the<br />
fossiliferous iron-ore, which continues through both<br />
Pennsylvania and Virginia, and is largely used in<br />
the furnaces in the former State.<br />
<br />
7. A thick mass of red shales, sometimes slightly<br />
calcareous. A reference to the section will show<br />
that this formation, resting upon the sandstone<br />
(No. 13), appears on the western flank of the North<br />
<br />

ZOOLOGY.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
FORMATION No. 23. (TERTIARY.)<br /><br />
This series consists of nearly horizontal, but inter-<br />
cepted, strata of sands and sandy clays, usually gray-<br />
ish or bluish in color.<br />
beds varying in thickness from a few inches to ten<br />
or fifteen feet, made up in a great measure of marine<br />
shells. Corals are also found among them, and in<br />
some localities in such abundance as to indicate that<br />
they are the remains of elevated coral reefs or<br />
islands. : :<br /><br />
The tertiary groups occupy all of the western<br />
shore south of the cretaceous, including St. Mary’s,<br />
Charles, and Calvert, and portions of Prince George’s<br />
and Anne Arundel counties. On the Eastern Shore<br />
they are believed to reach from a line a little north-<br />
west of Chester River, southward to a line running<br />
from near the head of the Little Choptank, and east-<br />
ward to the Delaware line. They embrace a small<br />
portion of Kent and Dorchester, and all of Queen<br />
Anne’s, Talbot, and Caroline.<br /><br />
They possess the highest agricultural interest, from<br />
the fact that they contain the very extensive deposits<br />
of “shell marl ” which have so largely contributed to<br />
increase the productive value of the land of the<br />
middle counties of the Eastern Shore.<br /><br />
FORMATION No. 24. (Post-TERTIARY.)<br /><br />
This formation embraces Worcester, Somerset,<br />
and the greater portion of Dorchester County, and<br />
consists of beds of loamy clays and sands, which it<br />
is believed have not been elevated more than from<br />
ten to thirty or forty feet above the tide-level. The<br />
numerous islands in the Chesapeake Bay are also<br />
post-tertiary. :<br /><br />
As it contains very few fossils, and perhaps none<br />
that will serve certainly to characterize it, the name<br /><br />
 is applied because of its position, being above the<br /><br />
tertiary. ‘<br /><br />
The character of the soil, in connection with the<br />
circumstances under which this region seems to have<br />
been formed, indicates that it consists of sediments<br />
derived from the water while flowing over it from<br />
the various formations already noticed. ~We can<br />
detect in the soil and its subjacent beds matters that<br />
must have come from points north and west of North<br />
Mountain. Except in some very sandy districts, it<br />
furnishes a mixed soil, whose fertility is readily main-<br />
tained or improved.<br /><br />

HE animals of Maryland are numerous in individ-<br />
uals and varied in type. The regions of greatest<br />
fertility are of course those most prolific of animal life,<br />
while the warmth of our summer climate, and abun-<br />
dance of water, furnish stimulus for its multiplica-<br />

Commencing with the vertebrated animals, which<br />
are the most conspicuous and the most useful to<br /><br />
~ man, we find about 693 species which are indigenous<br /><br />
to the State. These may be exhibited in the follow-<br />

In glancing over the Mammalia, it is to be ob-<br />
served that the orders of Edentata (Ant-eaters, Sloths,<br />
etc.) and Sirenia (Sea-Cows) are entirely wanting,<br />
while the Quadrumana and Marsupialia are repre-<br />
sented by but one species each, namely, Man and the<br />
Opossum. Of the hoofed animals, only the cloven-<br />
footed division (Artiodactyla Ruminantia) exist in a<br />
wild state, the horses and hog-like types ( Perrisodac-<br />
tyla and Artiodactyla Omnivora), as well as the Masto-<br />
dons (Proboscidia), having all disappeared before the<br />
human period.<br /><br />
The most conspicuous Mammals of the State are:<br />
the panther (Felis concolor), the wild-cats (Lynx Can-<br />
adensis and Lynx rufus), and the black bear ( Ursus<br />
Americanus), among the Carnivora. All of these<br />
species are not uncommon in the mountainous por-<br />
tions. Of the Ruminants, the bison (Bos' Americanus)<br />
and the elk (Cervus Canadensis), the largest known of<br />
the true deer, have been destroyed by human agency.<br />
The common deer (Cariacus Virginianus) is abundant.<br />
Of aquatic carnivora, two species of the seal have<br />
been seen on the coast and in the Chesapeake Bay ;<br />
one of these, the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata), has<br />
occurred twice in the Chesapeake.<br /><br />
- Whales are common off the coast. The right<br />
whale (Balena cisarctica, Cope,) is less so than for-<br />
merly, but may increase again, as their pursuitisnow<br />
less vigorous. Finner whales are still more common;<br />
a large species (Sibboldius lectirostris, Cope,) went<br />
ashore a few years ago near Berlin, and the Sib-<br />
boldius tuberosus (Cope), a smaller species of forty-five<br />
feet in length, has been seen in the Chesapeake.<br />
Other large species are seen, while the smaller forms<br />
are more abundant. Black fish (Globiocephalus),<br />
killers (Orca), and grampus occur. The porpoises<br />
(Delphinus, several species, and herring-hog, Phocena)<br />
are common on the coast and in the Chesapeake<br />
Bay. A white whale (Beluga) is said to have been<br />
caught in the latter, and exhibited in Baltimore.<br /><br />
Of the birds, the number of the group of singers<br />
(Oscines) exceeds those of all others, though the<br />
really superior musicians among them number but<br />
fifteen or twenty. The most numerously represented<br />
division, the wood-warblers ( Zanagride), are not fine<br />
singers, which mostly belong to the thrush and<br />
mocking-bird family. The mocking-bird finds a<br />
congenial home in the lower lands of the State, and<br />
may be seen in both wild and cultivated grounds.<br />
This, with many other, especially Southern species,<br />
find here the northern limit of their range in Mary-<br />
land. : ;<br /><br /><br /><br />
The bobolink (Dolichonyz), of the hang-nest divi-<br />
sion, may be trained to be almost equal to the best.<br />
The birds of prey, especially the hawks, are very<br />
numerous in species, while a single vulture (the<br />
Turkey Buzzard) is extremely common.<br /><br />
The game species are but few, but among them<br />
that noblest of them all, the wild turkey. Two spe-<br />
cies of grouse and a partridge complete the list. As a<br />
seaboard State, Maryland is permanently inhabited<br />
by numerous species of wading-birds. Several<br />
species of herons are common along the streams, of<br />
which Ardea herodias (the blue heron) is the largest,<br />
as well as the most abundant, excepting, perhaps,<br />
the smaller Butorides virescens (Fly-up-the-Creek).<br />
The grass-snipe, which fills the evening with its wild<br />
whistle, represents its family in the rich meadows<br />
throughout the whole year; the wood-cock remains<br />
in the thickets, while the true snipe migrates to the<br />
North in spring.<br /><br />
Owing to the possession of coast-line, and the<br />
great inland bay of Chesapeake, the swimming-birds<br />
are very numerous, especially the ZLamellirostral<br />
forms, or geese, ducks, etc. They remain in im-<br />
mense numbers in the bays of the coast and of the<br />
Chesapeake Bay during part of their autumn migra-<br />
tion southward, or until cold weather overtakes<br />
them. Here the gunners and caterers of Baltimore<br />
and Philadelphia betake themselves in numbers, and<br />
with decoys, blinds, flat-boats, and all the machinery<br />
of destruction, slaughter thousands of these birds<br />
for the markets of their respective cities.<br /><br />
The red-head (Fuliz Americana), canvas-back (F.<br />
vallisnerie), and blue-bill (F. mcwils), are most abun-<br />
dant. The Canada goose and brant mingle in great<br />
flocks, and a single species of swan (Cygnus Ameri<br />
canus) is not rare, but is shy.<br /><br />
The wood-duck (4ix sponsa) is known throughout<br />
the State during the year, but most of the species<br />
enter the rivers and ponds on their southern mi-<br />
gration. The loons remain all winter. Numerous<br />
gulls fish in the rivers and in Chesapeake Bay.<br /><br />
Among the reptiles; Maryland is notable for th:<br />
number of species of tortoises found within its<br />
limits, exceeding in this the European list several<br />
times. The snapping-turtle (Chelydra serpentina) is<br />
at home here, and the box-tortoise (Cistudo clausa) is<br />
extremely abundant. The Chelopus Muhlenbergii is<br />
confined to the north-eastern portion of the State<br />
and adjacent parts of New Jersey. Nearly all the<br />
species are valuable as food, and the ¢terrapin,”<br />
Malaclemnys palustris, Plychemys rugosa (red belly),<br />
and the snapper, are sold in large numbers in the -<br />
Baltimore market.<br />
© Of the 23 species of snakes, only two are venom-<br />
ous: these are, the copperhead (Ancistrodon con-<br />
tortrix), found everywhere where not exterminated ;<br />
and the common rattlesnake (Caudisona horrida),<br />
which originally inhabited the whole country. Both<br />
are dangerous, the rattlesnake occasionally attaining<br />
a length of six feet; but they are both exterminated<br />
from the best-settled regions. The remaining twenty<br />
species, where not too small (five species might be so<br />
reckoned), are very useful animals in destroying<br />
mice, moles, and other vermin, and are preserved by<br />
intelligent farmers on this account. I have taken<br />
three meadow-mice (Arvicolz) from the stomach of<br />
one black snake (Bascanion constrictor), and have<br />
found a house-snake (Ophibolous triangulus) with an<br />
Arvicola in its mouth, and two others held in two<br />
separate coils of the body, awaiting their turn to be<br />
swallowed. : .<br /><br />
Our State is very poorly supplied with lizards; but<br />
those creatures which most resemble them, the Sala-<br />
manders, are perhaps more numerously represented<br />
by species than in any other country of equal area<br />
in the world, excepting some of the Southern States.<br />
There are eighteen species of this group (Batrachia<br />
Urodela), most of which are small. The second in<br />
size in the world, however (Protonopsis horrida), the<br />
mud alligator or water-dog, occurs in the tributaries<br />
of the Youghiogheny, and has been caught occasion-<br />"," <br />

(Oscines) exceeds those of all others, though the<br />
really superior musicians among them number but<br />
fifteen or twenty. The most numerously represented<br />
division, the wood-warblers ( Zanagride), are not fine<br />
singers, which mostly belong to the thrush and<br />
mocking-bird family. The mocking-bird finds a<br />
congenial home in the lower lands of the State, and<br />
may be seen in both wild and cultivated grounds.<br />
This, with many other, especially Southern species,<br />
find here the northern limit of their range in Mary-<br />
land. : ;<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The bobolink (Dolichonyz), of the hang-nest divi-<br />
sion, may be trained to be almost equal to the best.<br />
The birds of prey, especially the hawks, are very<br />
numerous in species, while a single vulture (the<br />
Turkey Buzzard) is extremely common.<br />
<br />
The game species are but few, but among them<br />
that noblest of them all, the wild turkey. Two spe-<br />
cies of grouse and a partridge complete the list. As a<br />
seaboard State, Maryland is permanently inhabited<br />
by numerous species of wading-birds. Several<br />
species of herons are common along the streams, of<br />
which Ardea herodias (the blue heron) is the largest,<br />
as well as the most abundant, excepting, perhaps,<br />
the smaller Butorides virescens (Fly-up-the-Creek).<br />
The grass-snipe, which fills the evening with its wild<br />
whistle, represents its family in the rich meadows<br />
throughout the whole year; the wood-cock remains<br />
in the thickets, while the true snipe migrates to the<br />
North in spring.<br />
<br />
Owing to the possession of coast-line, and the<br />
great inland bay of Chesapeake, the swimming-birds<br />
are very numerous, especially the ZLamellirostral<br />
forms, or geese, ducks, etc. They remain in im-<br />
mense numbers in the bays of the coast and of the<br />
Chesapeake Bay during part of their autumn migra-<br />
tion southward, or until cold weather overtakes<br />
them. Here the gunners and caterers of Baltimore<br />
and Philadelphia betake themselves in numbers, and<br />
with decoys, blinds, flat-boats, and all the machinery<br />
of destruction, slaughter thousands of these birds<br />
for the markets of their respective cities.<br />
<br />
The red-head (Fuliz Americana), canvas-back (F.<br />
vallisnerie), and blue-bill (F. mcwils), are most abun-<br />
dant. The Canada goose and brant mingle in great<br />
flocks, and a single species of swan (Cygnus Ameri<br />
canus) is not rare, but is shy.<br />
<br />
The wood-duck (4ix sponsa) is known throughout<br />
the State during the year, but most of the species<br />
enter the rivers and ponds on their southern mi-<br />
gration. The loons remain all winter. Numerous<br />
gulls fish in the rivers and in Chesapeake Bay.<br />
<br />
Among the reptiles; Maryland is notable for th:<br />
number of species of tortoises found within its<br />
limits, exceeding in this the European list several<br />
times. The snapping-turtle (Chelydra serpentina) is<br />
at home here, and the box-tortoise (Cistudo clausa) is<br />
extremely abundant. The Chelopus Muhlenbergii is<br />
confined to the north-eastern portion of the State<br />
and adjacent parts of New Jersey. Nearly all the<br />
species are valuable as food, and the ¢terrapin,”<br />
Malaclemnys palustris, Plychemys rugosa (red belly),<br />
and the snapper, are sold in large numbers in the -<br />
Baltimore market.<br />
© Of the 23 species of snakes, only two are venom-<br />
ous: these are, the copperhead (Ancistrodon con-<br />
tortrix), found everywhere where not exterminated ;<br />
and the common rattlesnake (Caudisona horrida),<br />
which originally inhabited the whole country. Both<br />
are dangerous, the rattlesnake occasionally attaining<br />
a length of six feet; but they are both exterminated<br />
from the best-settled regions. The remaining twenty<br />
species, where not too small (five species might be so<br />
reckoned), are very useful animals in destroying<br />
mice, moles, and other vermin, and are preserved by<br />
intelligent farmers on this account. I have taken<br />
three meadow-mice (Arvicolz) from the stomach of<br />
one black snake (Bascanion constrictor), and have<br />
found a house-snake (Ophibolous triangulus) with an<br />
Arvicola in its mouth, and two others held in two<br />
separate coils of the body, awaiting their turn to be<br />
swallowed. : .<br />
<br />
Our State is very poorly supplied with lizards; but<br />
those creatures which most resemble them, the Sala-<br />
manders, are perhaps more numerously represented<br />
by species than in any other country of equal area<br />
in the world, excepting some of the Southern States.<br />
There are eighteen species of this group (Batrachia<br />
Urodela), most of which are small. The second in<br />
size in the world, however (Protonopsis horrida), the<br />
mud alligator or water-dog, occurs in the tributaries<br />
of the Youghiogheny, and has been caught occasion-<br />

ally in those of the Susquehanna. The Anura<br />
includes the frogs, toads, ete. There are 5 species<br />
of the former, 1 of the latter, and 4 of tree-toads.<br />
The Scaphiopus is subterranean, excavating its bur-<br />
rows backward with the shovel-bearing hind-feet. It<br />
only comes to the surface to breed, after thunder-<br />
showers in April, and then in the evening, and is<br />
recognized by its loud, discordant notes.<br /><br />
The coast furnishes an inexhaustible supply of<br />
edible fishes, and many forms interesting to the nat-<br />
uralist occur. Nowhere is the large “sheep’s-head”<br />
more abundant and palatable (Archosarqus probato-<br />
cephalus), and the mackerel (Scomber sp.) are not infe-<br />
rior in flavor. Sea-eels are much eaten, and various<br />
species of Scienide (‘ Weak-fish, spots”), ete., make<br />
up the bulk of marketable fishes. The toad-fish<br />
(Batrachus), goose-fish (Lophius), with its huge<br />
mouth, and the slender pipe-fishes and sea-horses<br />
(Lyngnathus and Hippocampus), attract the visitor by<br />
their strange appearance. The largest of the perch-<br />
like fishes is the drum (Pogonias fasciatus), which has<br />
powerful grinding pharyngeal teeth, and is very de-<br />
structive to the oysters.<br /><br />
There are at least 140 species of fresh-water fishes<br />
in the waters of Maryland, of which 80 species are<br />
important as food.<br />
mac and Susquehanna, while there are 41 inhabiting<br />
the Youghiogheny and its branches. When we re-<br />
flect that each female of these species spawns several<br />
thousands or hundreds of thousands of eggs in a<br />
season, we can readily estimate the great importance<br />
this crop might be to us as a source of cheap animal<br />
food, were it cultivated to the extent of the capacity<br />
of our streams. That capacity in Maryland is very<br />
great, for it depends chiefly on the supply of food<br />
for fishes furnished by nature. This is ultimately<br />
derived from a strong vegetation, either directly or<br />
through the insects which feed upon it, or the fishes<br />
thus nourished as food for the carnivorous species.<br />
Ultimately, then, a productive soil is as much the<br />
condition of fish production as of any other, and<br />
thus our State possesses, evidently, extensive ad-<br />
vantages in this respect.<br /><br />
Some of these species migrate to salt water in<br />
autumn, and remain there during the winter; others<br />
descend the creeks to the rivers, and the rivers to<br />
their deeper waters, and congregate in them in cold<br />
weather; others remain all winter in their usual<br />
haunts, burying themselves in mud, and undergoing<br />
a kind of hibernation: while some —for example,<br />
certain catfish—do not take even this precaution.<br />
With a few exceptions, on the advent of spring and<br />
the breaking up of the ice, they ascend to the upper<br />
and clear waters, or to the gravelly bottoms, to de-<br />
posit their spawn. The exceptions are the eels and<br />
trout. The former descend the rivers in autumn,<br />
and deposit their eggs in salt water; the latter spawn<br />
in the upper waters in late autumn, prior to their<br />
riverward migration. Of course, no fishing is per-<br />
mitted by law during the months of spawning and<br />
the pericd of migration. Where the fishes avoid<br />
dams and other obstructions by fish-ways or canal-<br />
locks, these should be especially guarded by the<br />
Fish Commissioners’ deputics or wardens, to prevent<br />
the wholesale destruction that can be inflicted on<br />
them at such times.<br /><br />
The most valuable food-fishes in the State are<br />
members of the herring family (Clupcide). The shad<br />
(Alosa tyrannus) is well known to the inhabitants of<br />
our eastern cities as the best of table-fishes. It had<br />
been almost exterminated from the Susquehanna, but<br />
legislation has restored it. In the Potomac itis still<br /><br />
abundant, but reduced, and further legislation is |<br /><br />
needed to protect it. The herring (Pomolobus pseudo-<br />
harengus), or, properly, ale-wife, is immensely numer-<br />
ous, and is caught in the Potomac and Susquehanna.<br />
The fisheries at the mouth of the latter river supply<br />
an extensive region. An anchovy (Engraulis vittatus)<br />
visits Chesapeake Bay in immense numbers every<br />
spring, and might furnish quite as large a supply of<br />
food as the European species of the same name.<br /><br />
81 species exist in the Poto-,<br /><br /><br /><br />
Of the salmon family, the brook-trout (Salmo fon-<br />
tinalis) is our best-known species. This fish, if prop-<br />
erly protected, will always be important to the<br />
inhabitants of the mountainous portions of our State,<br />
where other species are less abundant. It cannot<br />
fail to be valued, if allowed to increase sufficiently,<br />
by that class of our people who, in those countries,<br />
may find beef and mutton more or less expensive, or<br />
otherwise beyond their reach. The sea salmon (S.<br />
salar) will perhaps never be an important feature of<br />
our fisheries. The Hudson is its southern limit of<br />
migration, and it has been extremely rare there fora<br />
very long period. The Delaware has rarely furnished<br />
a specimen; and though the experiment of cultiva-<br />
tion in our waters is certainly worth trying, the<br />
transplanting to the Susquehanna would most likely<br />
fail. -<br />
The Salmonide furnish the species which are most<br />
useful to the pisciculturist. The brook-trout (Salmo<br />
JSontinalis) is selected as the most hardy, and its prop-<br />
agation is already an important branch of industry.<br />
We will, however, not speak of pisciculture. The<br />
tributaries of the Ohio are entirely without any resi-<br />
dent species of trout, except in a few of its highest<br />
mountain streams.<br /><br />
Many of our most important fishes belong to the<br />
perch family (Percide). The finest fishes among<br />
these are the pike-perch (Stizostedium). The S. Ameri-<br />
canum, or jack, sometimes called jack-salmon, or even<br />
salmon, for flavor and general character of flesh, and<br />
for large size, is only exceeded in value by the shad,<br />
yet it is almost unknown to our markets, except as<br />
an imported article from the lakes. It exists in the<br />
Susquehanna, and ought to be so protected as to be<br />
very abundant there. It is common in the Alle-<br />
ghany and tributaries, and is associated with another<br />
fine species of smaller size, the S. salmoneum, Raf.<br />
Both these fishes ought to be cultivated. The jack<br />
reaches, occasionally, forty pounds, and, like the<br />
trout, seeks the highest and coolest waters that will<br />
float him. Ie possesses great activity and strength,<br />
and is a ravenous destroyer of perch and other spe-<br />
cies. Were he not so superior in every way to all<br />
others, this habit might condemn him; as it is, we<br />
regard it as one of the best species we possess. In<br />
the South, it is eagerly bought, and forms the prin-<br />
cipal table-fish for the various places of resort,<br />
springs, etc., where it can be obtained. It is sup-<br />
plied with means of defence in its powerful teeth,<br />
with which it will inflict wounds. Yet this large<br />
species is almost unknown in many parts of our<br />
State, and as a source of food is comparatively insig-<br />
nificant. As its mode of life combine those of the<br />
brook-trout and bass, there is no reason why some<br />
enterprising person should not make it an object of<br />
culture on the Susquehanna or westward. Proper<br />
protection would also have as much effect in increas-<br />
ing its numbers as in the case of any other species<br />
we have.<br /><br />
The brackish water lovers, the yellow perch and<br />
white and striped bass, are well known. They have<br />
suffered great diminution of numbers from improper<br />
spring fishing, and fishing through the ice at the<br />
mouths of streams in winter. Both these practices<br />
should be put a stop to, in accordance with the<br />
law.<br /><br />
The black bass (Micropterus fasciatus)is only native<br />
of our State in the tributaries of the Youghiogheny.<br />
The public scarcely remembers its introduction into<br />
the Potomac. The James River is the most north-<br />
ern of the eastern rivers which contains species of<br />
the same group (the green bass), but the introduction<br /><br />
of both that species and the present into the Poto- |<br /><br />
mac has been a success. It is a valuable acquisition,<br />
and, though carnivorous, will not interfere mate-<br />
rially with the spawn and fry of the ale-wives (her-<br />
ring of our fishermen) and shad, if the latter are<br />
protected against improper fishing. It attains a<br />
weight of from eight to twelve pounds, and is a<br />
good table-fish. - The “white perch,” or *“moon-<br />
perch,” of the Potomac (Pomoxys hexacanthus), is not<br /><br /><br /><br />
less valuable than the black or green bass. An oc-<br />
casional straggler is taken in the Delaware, and it<br />
occurs in the Susquehanna. It is an excellent table-<br />
fish, and ought to be protected and cultivated. Its<br />
weight is from one to five pounds; in form it is flat<br />
and round, like the sunfish.<br /><br />
The smaller sunfishes also have considerable mar-<br />
ket value. The common species (Pomotis vulgaris)<br />
appears, as is known, in large numbers in winter on<br />
our stalls. The Lipomis appendix is equally abun-<br />
dant, and would, if protected, increase to an almost<br />
incredible extent. In the same way, the mud sun-<br />
fish (Ambloplites pomotis, Baird), which grows to the<br />
size of the white bass in the sluggish streams of the<br />
tide-water region, will become at some future day a<br />
source of food to a considerable population. In fact,<br />
all these fishes could be easily rendered so abundant<br />
in a few years as to sell for a cent apiece, instead of<br />
five and ten cents per pound.<br /><br />
There is much difference of opinion as to the merits<br />
of the pike, and its fitness to receive State protection.<br />
Two species occur in the Potomac (Esox reticulatus<br />
and . porosus), and three in the Susquehanna, (the<br />
same with E. umbrosus.) [Those of the Youghiogheny<br /><br />
are scarcely worth considering, as they are few in<br /><br />
~number.] The K. reficulatus of the east is, on the<br /><br />
other hand, an abundant fish, which sells well and is<br />
generally esteemed.  For ourselves, we do not join<br />
in the condemnation visited on the pike by some,<br />
and have a liking for its flesh. If its increase can<br />
be restrained, instead of favored, in waters which<br />
produce the best species, it will cease to inflict much<br />
injury by its voracious habits, for it naturally haunts<br />
still or grassy waters, where it devours fishes inferior<br />
to itself, as eels and catfish and frogs. On the whole,<br />
we do not think the pike needs any protection, as<br />
he has many natural advantages in the struggle<br />
for life; but he should not be destroyed except for<br />
the table.<br /><br />
Eels need no protection, as they pass around ob-<br />
structions by land, and breed in the ocean. Their<br />
numbers have not diminished in our waters to the<br />
same extent as other species, and their capture and<br />
barreling has long beenrr an important industry on<br />
the Susquehanna. When our State is more densely<br />
populated they will be more constantly sought, and<br />
will require protection, as other fishes. The catfishes<br />
of our eastern streams, now subordinate, will then<br />
become very valuable also. : :<br /><br />
The fishes of the carp, sucker, and chub family<br />
are not valued at present, though in Europe they<br />
form a very important part of the food of the inland<br />
population. We have already alluded to their pros-<br />
pective importance here, and on that ground alone<br />
they should share in the protection afforded to our<br />
more valued species. They form, in fact, the bulk<br />
of the piscine population of the United States, and<br />
besides furnishing food for man and bird, form the<br />
sustenance of the perch, bass, jack, pike, and other<br />
carnivorous species. The American carp (Carpiodes<br />
cyprinus), a 2-5-pound fish, is eaten along the Chesa-<br />
peake. The other species are numerous; two come<br />
occasionally to the Baltimore market, and others<br />
occur all over the State. Of the whole group, nine<br />
species are valuable as food-fishes, *but rather on<br />
account of quantity than quality. None suffer more<br />
from the want of protection than these fishes. They<br />
inhabit the upper waters of all our streams, and are<br />
cut off in thousands by every mill-dam on the many<br />
smaller and larger creeks in the country. Their<br />
enormous productiveness (some deposit at one time<br />
500,000 eggs) does not make up for this in the case<br />
of any particular stream from which they may have<br />
been finally driven. The fish-ways, which preserve<br />
the shad and ale-wives, will also protect these.<br /><br />

species is almost unknown in many parts of our<br />
State, and as a source of food is comparatively insig-<br />
nificant. As its mode of life combine those of the<br />
brook-trout and bass, there is no reason why some<br />
enterprising person should not make it an object of<br />
culture on the Susquehanna or westward. Proper<br />
protection would also have as much effect in increas-<br />
ing its numbers as in the case of any other species<br />
we have.<br />
<br />
The brackish water lovers, the yellow perch and<br />
white and striped bass, are well known. They have<br />
suffered great diminution of numbers from improper<br />
spring fishing, and fishing through the ice at the<br />
mouths of streams in winter. Both these practices<br />
should be put a stop to, in accordance with the<br />
law.<br />
<br />
The black bass (Micropterus fasciatus)is only native<br />
of our State in the tributaries of the Youghiogheny.<br />
The public scarcely remembers its introduction into<br />
the Potomac. The James River is the most north-<br />
ern of the eastern rivers which contains species of<br />
the same group (the green bass), but the introduction<br />
<br />
of both that species and the present into the Poto- |<br />
<br />
mac has been a success. It is a valuable acquisition,<br />
and, though carnivorous, will not interfere mate-<br />
rially with the spawn and fry of the ale-wives (her-<br />
ring of our fishermen) and shad, if the latter are<br />
protected against improper fishing. It attains a<br />
weight of from eight to twelve pounds, and is a<br />
good table-fish. - The “white perch,” or *“moon-<br />
perch,” of the Potomac (Pomoxys hexacanthus), is not<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
less valuable than the black or green bass. An oc-<br />
casional straggler is taken in the Delaware, and it<br />
occurs in the Susquehanna. It is an excellent table-<br />
fish, and ought to be protected and cultivated. Its<br />
weight is from one to five pounds; in form it is flat<br />
and round, like the sunfish.<br />
<br />
The smaller sunfishes also have considerable mar-<br />
ket value. The common species (Pomotis vulgaris)<br />
appears, as is known, in large numbers in winter on<br />
our stalls. The Lipomis appendix is equally abun-<br />
dant, and would, if protected, increase to an almost<br />
incredible extent. In the same way, the mud sun-<br />
fish (Ambloplites pomotis, Baird), which grows to the<br />
size of the white bass in the sluggish streams of the<br />
tide-water region, will become at some future day a<br />
source of food to a considerable population. In fact,<br />
all these fishes could be easily rendered so abundant<br />
in a few years as to sell for a cent apiece, instead of<br />
five and ten cents per pound.<br />
<br />
There is much difference of opinion as to the merits<br />
of the pike, and its fitness to receive State protection.<br />
Two species occur in the Potomac (Esox reticulatus<br />
and . porosus), and three in the Susquehanna, (the<br />
same with E. umbrosus.) [Those of the Youghiogheny<br />
<br />
are scarcely worth considering, as they are few in<br />
<br />
~number.] The K. reficulatus of the east is, on the<br />
<br />
other hand, an abundant fish, which sells well and is<br />
generally esteemed.  For ourselves, we do not join<br />
in the condemnation visited on the pike by some,<br />
and have a liking for its flesh. If its increase can<br />
be restrained, instead of favored, in waters which<br />
produce the best species, it will cease to inflict much<br />
injury by its voracious habits, for it naturally haunts<br />
still or grassy waters, where it devours fishes inferior<br />
to itself, as eels and catfish and frogs. On the whole,<br />
we do not think the pike needs any protection, as<br />
he has many natural advantages in the struggle<br />
for life; but he should not be destroyed except for<br />
the table.<br />
<br />
Eels need no protection, as they pass around ob-<br />
structions by land, and breed in the ocean. Their<br />
numbers have not diminished in our waters to the<br />
same extent as other species, and their capture and<br />
barreling has long beenrr an important industry on<br />
the Susquehanna. When our State is more densely<br />
populated they will be more constantly sought, and<br />
will require protection, as other fishes. The catfishes<br />
of our eastern streams, now subordinate, will then<br />
become very valuable also. : :<br />
<br />
The fishes of the carp, sucker, and chub family<br />
are not valued at present, though in Europe they<br />
form a very important part of the food of the inland<br />
population. We have already alluded to their pros-<br />
pective importance here, and on that ground alone<br />
they should share in the protection afforded to our<br />
more valued species. They form, in fact, the bulk<br />
of the piscine population of the United States, and<br />
besides furnishing food for man and bird, form the<br />
sustenance of the perch, bass, jack, pike, and other<br />
carnivorous species. The American carp (Carpiodes<br />
cyprinus), a 2-5-pound fish, is eaten along the Chesa-<br />
peake. The other species are numerous; two come<br />
occasionally to the Baltimore market, and others<br />
occur all over the State. Of the whole group, nine<br />
species are valuable as food-fishes, *but rather on<br />
account of quantity than quality. None suffer more<br />
from the want of protection than these fishes. They<br />
inhabit the upper waters of all our streams, and are<br />
cut off in thousands by every mill-dam on the many<br />
smaller and larger creeks in the country. Their<br />
enormous productiveness (some deposit at one time<br />
500,000 eggs) does not make up for this in the case<br />
of any particular stream from which they may have<br />
been finally driven. The fish-ways, which preserve<br />
the shad and ale-wives, will also protect these.<br />
<br />

In Maryland, as elsewhere, the articulated animals<br />
exhibit a great preponderance in number of species.<br />

ZOOLOGY,<br /><br /><br /><br />
tatives; two of the crabs of the coast are sold in<br />
greatnumbersin the Baltimore market ; the largest of<br />
these is the Lupa diacantha, Say. Lobsters (Homarus<br />
Americanus) are an extensive article of consumption.<br />
No species is more abundant than the singular king-<br />
crab (Limulus polyphemus), whose relationships appear<br /><br />
to be with the old forms of the coal and earlier peri--<br /><br />
ods of time.<br /><br />
The largest from fresh waters are the crawfishes<br />
(Astacus), which abound in every stream. The little<br />
Branchiopods occur also in the streams. Some spe-<br />
cies are parasitic on fishes. The Isopods are repre-<br />
sented by the very abundant ¢ wood-lice,” which are<br />
of the very few land Crustacea. The Entomostraca<br />
have a hinged shell, shaped like that of a muscle;<br />
there are many minute species.<br /><br />
The Myriapods, or centipedes, abound. One long-<br />
legged, short-bodied species (Cermatia forceps), is<br />
common in out-buildings and cellars, and is very<br />
useful in destroying insects. The active species of<br />
the field and wood are also carnivorous (Seolopocriyp-<br />
tops, Lithobius, et al.), and inflict sharp but harmless<br />
bites on the finger which attacks them. The Spiro-<br />
bolus is large and red-ringed, and exudes a pernicious<br />
fluid, like nitro-muriatic acid; and in the same way,<br />
the stout, short Polydesmus discharges a substance<br />
with the smell of prussic acid.<br /><br />
Spiders, or Arachnida, are very abundant in spe-<br />
cies, and many are of brilliant colors and singular<br />
forms. Though we have no tarantula, a common<br />
species of the same genus (Mygale) spreads over an<br />
area of two inches in diameter with the feet. Wood-<br />
ticks (Zzodes) are also abundant.<br /><br />
There are probably 25,000 species of insects in the<br />
State. All the orders are abundantly represented,<br />
but those which embrace the greatest number of spe-<br />
cies are the Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and the Lepi-<br />
doptera ; that is, the beetles, the wasps, bees, ete.,<br />
and the butterflies. The Neuroptera (dragon-flics,<br />
cte.) are carnivorous, and are friends of the farmer.<br />
Besides the numerous diurnal dragon-flies, the Chauli-<br />
odus and Sialis, with leaf-like wings, and altogether<br />
an ancient type, fly at night. So does the little<br />
green Chrysopa, which has a vile smell of sulphuret-<br />
ted hydrogen.<br /><br />
"" We have in Maryland one termito (ZTermes flavipes),<br /><br />
which, though not so injurious as its congeners of<br />
the tropics, creates havoc in gate-posts, door-steps,<br />
dry floors, ete.<br /><br />
The grasshoppers (Orthoplera) sometimes increase<br />
80 as to be injurious to the farmers, but never to the<br />
extent seen in Western America and Asia. The<br />
musical insects are all here. The katydid (Platy-<br />
phyllum concavum) makes the summer woods uproar-<br />
ious; in the fields hot with the blazing sun, other<br />
species sing like thousands of small shuttles flying;<br />
and the shrubberies are vocal at evening with the<br />
musical thrill of several species of @canthus.<br /><br />
The list of beetles is endless, and many of them<br />
remain unnoticed by naturalists. Many mischievous<br />
pests belong here, which have made great havoc with<br />
our trees and crops. Thus, of the long-horns, several<br />
species of Saperda bore our fruit and hedge-trees to<br />
death; the Clyfus has ruined our locust groves (Ro-<br />
binia pscudacacia); the Oncideres girdle our hickorics;<br /><br />
~the Curculios sting the fruit to such an extent as to<br /><br />
ruin some crops entirely. Thus, plums can no longer<br />
be raised near Philadelphia without extraordinary<br />
protection, and cherries suffer severely. Few apples<br />
do not contain worms. Species of Baridius bore<br />
stems of the potato, and admit water, which causes<br />
rot. The European grain-weevil has come over to<br />
share the victories of his tribe.<br /><br />
The Phytophagous beetles are no better. The<br /><br />
Galeruca vittata has destroyed many elms by eating<br />
the leaves. Other species eat our cucumbers and<br />
cabbages. To keep down these marauders, many<br />
carnivorous species exist. Some species of Iyiia<br />
possess some value as blistering-flies, and one of<br />
them (L. vitlata) eats up the potato tops. Some fif-<br />
teen species of fire-flies spangle the evening shades,<br />
but none of them are very large.<br /><br /><br /><br />
The wasp family is largely represented; but the<br />
bee is rot a native of the State or Continent. Nu-<br />
merous relatives of the wasps build nests of varied<br />
construction, and defend them with formidable<br />
stings. The most numerous family of the Iymenop-<br />
tera is that of the JIehneumons, which check other in-<br />
sect life by laying eggs in the grubs. The galls<br />
(Cynipidee) are scarcely less abundant; their sting-<br />
excrescences deface almost every species of wild<br />
plant.<br /><br />
Ants abound, and some are of large size. But<br />
few are injurious, though two species infest houses.<br />
The largest of the order, species of Stizus, are com-<br />
mon. They have stings which inflict serious wounds.<br />
They burrow in the earth, where they lay up a store<br />
of Cicaaz. They are called “tiger hornets.”<br /><br />
The Dptera, or flies, abound in blood-sucking spe-<br />
cies, from horse- and ox-flies an inch long, to the<br />
delicate mosquito and minute black midge. Hemip-<br />
tera. furnishes the rattling Clcada (“locust” of the<br />
common people), the well-armed Reduvius, and a<br />
host of plain and gay plant-suckers. The bed-bug,<br />
unfortunately, occurs, but is an importation from<br />
Europe.<br /><br />
The Lepidoptera embrace many species of much<br />
beauty, especially among the diurnal species; never-<br />
theless, our region cannot claim preéminence in these<br />
as much as in the numerous and large species of the<br />
Saturnia and Cossus types. The former make large<br />
cocoons of coarse silk, which can be easily cultivated,<br /><br />
and will probably give rise to a silk industry at a<br /><br />
future day. The nocturnal species, or millers, ete.,<br />
are legion, and their work is generally unfavorable<br />
to agriculture. Their eggs produce cut-worms,<br />
apple - worms, ete., and multitudes of leaf-borers,<br />
whose sinuous tracks can be seen in some leaves of<br />
almost every native plant,<br /><br />
There are many species of Molluses in Maryland,<br />
which are of course either marine, fresh-water, or<br />
terrestrial. The first abound on the coast; the two<br />
species of Busycon may be noted as the most striking.<br />
In the bays, as the Sinepuxent, cte., and in the<br />
estuary of the Chesapeake, the oyster (Ostrea Virgin-<br />
ica) abounds, which furnishes the basis of such exten-<br />
sive industries in Baltimore and other places. The<br />
former are far more numerous in the tributaries of<br />
the Youghiogheny than elsewhere, and consist mainly<br />
of pearl muscles (Unio and Anodonta). The species<br />
and individuals are abundant, and. of beautiful color<br />
and lustre. They are employed in making pearl<br />
buttons. The land or air-breathing species are, on<br />
the other hand, Gasteropods of the Pulmonate division.<br />
They chiefly abound in the limestone valleys of the<br />
Alleghanies and the coal regions, on account of the<br />
abundance of materials for constructing their spiral<br />
shells. There are about 65 species in the State, of<br />
which a considerable proportion would be termed<br />
snails. Some are moderately large, but a majority<br />
are small, many extremely so.  Two species (Zeben-<br />
nophorus) are without shell ; both are common.<br /><br />
The Polyzoa is a group of minute molluscs having<br />
a common house or domicil, which extends over<br />
stones or other objects, branching after the manner<br />
of corals. Several species oceur in our streams and<br />
ponds; one of them (Pectinatella magnifica) is the<br />
largest in the world. It forms gelatinous masses<br />
round roots or sticks, and contains hundreds of indi-<br />
viduals. ;<br /><br />
The Radiate and Cewlenterate animals are marine.<br />
The sandy shores of the coast do not produce many<br />
sedentary species, but meduse and the Portuguese<br />
man-of-war abound. Acres of beautiful jelly-fish<br />
may be seen on the lower Chesapeake, which often<br />
furnish shelter and food for a little fish beneath their<br />
umbrella. The Hydra of fresh water is also a (-<br />
lenterate. 1t is, in form, urn-shaped, with slender<br />
arms and a stem-like base attached to any support in<br />
the water. They are very simple in structure, and<br />
lengthen their arms exceedingly in scarch of prey.<br />
They may be cut into small pieces, when each piece<br />
kecomes a perfect Hydra. The lowest of animals<br /><br /><br /><br />
are the Protozoa. They are unicellular, composed of<br />
aggregated similar cells or of uniform gelatine. Into<br />
the second class enter the sponges. A fresh-water<br />
sponge (Spongille), whose substance is supported by<br />
horny spicules, occurs in sluggish waters in the<br />
Brandywine and other streams,<br /><br />
SECTION III.—DISTRIBUTION.<br /><br />
We will now take a bricf view of the relations of<br />
the Maryland fauna to those of other regions of the<br />
earth.<br /><br />
North America, of which Maryland forms a part,<br />
embraces the Nearctic fauna. This one is more<br />
nearly related in character to that of Europe and<br />
North Asia (Palwarctic) than any other, though it<br />
possesses an admixture of South American (Neotrop-<br />
ical) life. The most remote from it in character is<br />
the Australian fauna, then the Palwotropical (Indian),<br />
and the African is a little nearer. The Nearctic<br />
Jauna is distinguished by its natural productions into<br />
the Fastern district (to the plains), the Middle (to the<br />
Sierra Nevada), the Pacific (the western coast), and<br />
the Sonoran, which includes Arizona, Sonora, and<br />
part of Lower California. The Eastern district is<br />
characterized, among other points, by the abundance<br />
of tortoises and poverty in lizards, as seen above; by<br />
the presence of bony gars (Lepidosteus), pike (Esox),<br />
and Nematognathi (catfishes). In the broad sense, the<br />
life of the district is characterized by the presence<br />
of some ancient forms of life, which have passed<br />
away in prior geologic epochs, though the Neotrop-<br />
ical and Australian fauna possess a still larger portion<br />
of such. Thus, the snapping-tortoise and the Profo-<br />
nopsis have fossil representatives in some strata of<br />
Europe, and the extinct relatives of the bony gar<br />
abound in still older rocks.<br /><br />
Another proportion of types may be considered<br />
Neotropical (South American) in character. Such are<br />
among Mammals, the opossum and the wood-mice<br />
(Hesperomys); among Birds, the Tyrannide (king-<br />
bird, pewees, etc.), the humming-birds (Zrochilus),<br />
and the tanagers (Pyranga); among the Fishes, the<br />
Nematognathi may be mentioned.  Of especial North<br />
American character may be enumerated the raccoon<br />
(Procyon), the skunks (Mephitis), and the lesser deer<br />
(Cariacus); also the American porcupine (Lirethizon).<br />
Among birds, the turkey and the wood-warblers<br />
(Dendreeca) belong especially to the Nearctic fuuna.<br />
Among reptiles, the rattlesnakes and copperheads,<br />
the whole of the salamanders except two species, and<br />
especially the Protonopsis and Necturus, are especially<br />
North American.  Of this character, among the<br /><br />
. fishes, are the gar, dog-fish, pike, and Etheostomine<br /><br />
perch, an extensive group of small fishes without<br />
swim-bladders, found in all streams.<br /><br />
There are certain climatal divisions of the fauna<br />
of the Eastern district of North America, regulated<br />
by the elevation of the surface, the latitude, temper-<br />
ature, ete. These have been named the Floridian,<br />
the Louisianian, the Carolinian, the Alleghanion, the<br />
Canadian, the Hudsonian, ete. Maryland is traversed<br />
by the Carolinian, the Alleghanian, and the Cana-<br />
dian, and their boundaries separate the breeding-<br />
places of various species of birds, and range of others,<br />
of mammals, ete.<br /><br />
The greater part of the area of the State, that s,<br />
the low countries from the ocean to the Potomac and<br />
to the line extending from Wilmington to Baltimoroe<br />
and to Washington, D. C., is the especial range<br />
of the mocking-bird, the blue grossbeak, the summer<br />
red-bird (Lyranga wstiva), and others. Also of the<br />
pine meadow-mouse (Arvicola pinetorum), ete.<br /><br />
The middle part of the State is occupied by the<br />
Alleghanian fauna, which extends north and south.<br />
The higher ridges of the Alleghany Mountains are<br />
included in the Canadian, as indicated by the breed-<br />
ing of the snow-bird, various warblers, and the range<br />
of some land animals. This fauna extends along the<br />
mountains to Georgia. Our State, then, presents a<br />
fine and prolific ficld to the student of Biological<br />
Science.<br /><br /><br />"," <br />

excrescences deface almost every species of wild<br />
plant.<br />
<br />
Ants abound, and some are of large size. But<br />
few are injurious, though two species infest houses.<br />
The largest of the order, species of Stizus, are com-<br />
mon. They have stings which inflict serious wounds.<br />
They burrow in the earth, where they lay up a store<br />
of Cicaaz. They are called “tiger hornets.”<br />
<br />
The Dptera, or flies, abound in blood-sucking spe-<br />
cies, from horse- and ox-flies an inch long, to the<br />
delicate mosquito and minute black midge. Hemip-<br />
tera. furnishes the rattling Clcada (“locust” of the<br />
common people), the well-armed Reduvius, and a<br />
host of plain and gay plant-suckers. The bed-bug,<br />
unfortunately, occurs, but is an importation from<br />
Europe.<br />
<br />
The Lepidoptera embrace many species of much<br />
beauty, especially among the diurnal species; never-<br />
theless, our region cannot claim preéminence in these<br />
as much as in the numerous and large species of the<br />
Saturnia and Cossus types. The former make large<br />
cocoons of coarse silk, which can be easily cultivated,<br />
<br />
and will probably give rise to a silk industry at a<br />
<br />
future day. The nocturnal species, or millers, ete.,<br />
are legion, and their work is generally unfavorable<br />
to agriculture. Their eggs produce cut-worms,<br />
apple - worms, ete., and multitudes of leaf-borers,<br />
whose sinuous tracks can be seen in some leaves of<br />
almost every native plant,<br />
<br />
There are many species of Molluses in Maryland,<br />
which are of course either marine, fresh-water, or<br />
terrestrial. The first abound on the coast; the two<br />
species of Busycon may be noted as the most striking.<br />
In the bays, as the Sinepuxent, cte., and in the<br />
estuary of the Chesapeake, the oyster (Ostrea Virgin-<br />
ica) abounds, which furnishes the basis of such exten-<br />
sive industries in Baltimore and other places. The<br />
former are far more numerous in the tributaries of<br />
the Youghiogheny than elsewhere, and consist mainly<br />
of pearl muscles (Unio and Anodonta). The species<br />
and individuals are abundant, and. of beautiful color<br />
and lustre. They are employed in making pearl<br />
buttons. The land or air-breathing species are, on<br />
the other hand, Gasteropods of the Pulmonate division.<br />
They chiefly abound in the limestone valleys of the<br />
Alleghanies and the coal regions, on account of the<br />
abundance of materials for constructing their spiral<br />
shells. There are about 65 species in the State, of<br />
which a considerable proportion would be termed<br />
snails. Some are moderately large, but a majority<br />
are small, many extremely so.  Two species (Zeben-<br />
nophorus) are without shell ; both are common.<br />
<br />
The Polyzoa is a group of minute molluscs having<br />
a common house or domicil, which extends over<br />
stones or other objects, branching after the manner<br />
of corals. Several species oceur in our streams and<br />
ponds; one of them (Pectinatella magnifica) is the<br />
largest in the world. It forms gelatinous masses<br />
round roots or sticks, and contains hundreds of indi-<br />
viduals. ;<br />
<br />
The Radiate and Cewlenterate animals are marine.<br />
The sandy shores of the coast do not produce many<br />
sedentary species, but meduse and the Portuguese<br />
man-of-war abound. Acres of beautiful jelly-fish<br />
may be seen on the lower Chesapeake, which often<br />
furnish shelter and food for a little fish beneath their<br />
umbrella. The Hydra of fresh water is also a (-<br />
lenterate. 1t is, in form, urn-shaped, with slender<br />
arms and a stem-like base attached to any support in<br />
the water. They are very simple in structure, and<br />
lengthen their arms exceedingly in scarch of prey.<br />
They may be cut into small pieces, when each piece<br />
kecomes a perfect Hydra. The lowest of animals<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
are the Protozoa. They are unicellular, composed of<br />
aggregated similar cells or of uniform gelatine. Into<br />
the second class enter the sponges. A fresh-water<br />
sponge (Spongille), whose substance is supported by<br />
horny spicules, occurs in sluggish waters in the<br />
Brandywine and other streams,<br />
<br />
SECTION III.—DISTRIBUTION.<br />
<br />
We will now take a bricf view of the relations of<br />
the Maryland fauna to those of other regions of the<br />
earth.<br />
<br />
North America, of which Maryland forms a part,<br />
embraces the Nearctic fauna. This one is more<br />
nearly related in character to that of Europe and<br />
North Asia (Palwarctic) than any other, though it<br />
possesses an admixture of South American (Neotrop-<br />
ical) life. The most remote from it in character is<br />
the Australian fauna, then the Palwotropical (Indian),<br />
and the African is a little nearer. The Nearctic<br />
Jauna is distinguished by its natural productions into<br />
the Fastern district (to the plains), the Middle (to the<br />
Sierra Nevada), the Pacific (the western coast), and<br />
the Sonoran, which includes Arizona, Sonora, and<br />
part of Lower California. The Eastern district is<br />
characterized, among other points, by the abundance<br />
of tortoises and poverty in lizards, as seen above; by<br />
the presence of bony gars (Lepidosteus), pike (Esox),<br />
and Nematognathi (catfishes). In the broad sense, the<br />
life of the district is characterized by the presence<br />
of some ancient forms of life, which have passed<br />
away in prior geologic epochs, though the Neotrop-<br />
ical and Australian fauna possess a still larger portion<br />
of such. Thus, the snapping-tortoise and the Profo-<br />
nopsis have fossil representatives in some strata of<br />
Europe, and the extinct relatives of the bony gar<br />
abound in still older rocks.<br />
<br />
Another proportion of types may be considered<br />
Neotropical (South American) in character. Such are<br />
among Mammals, the opossum and the wood-mice<br />
(Hesperomys); among Birds, the Tyrannide (king-<br />
bird, pewees, etc.), the humming-birds (Zrochilus),<br />
and the tanagers (Pyranga); among the Fishes, the<br />
Nematognathi may be mentioned.  Of especial North<br />
American character may be enumerated the raccoon<br />
(Procyon), the skunks (Mephitis), and the lesser deer<br />
(Cariacus); also the American porcupine (Lirethizon).<br />
Among birds, the turkey and the wood-warblers<br />
(Dendreeca) belong especially to the Nearctic fuuna.<br />
Among reptiles, the rattlesnakes and copperheads,<br />
the whole of the salamanders except two species, and<br />
especially the Protonopsis and Necturus, are especially<br />
North American.  Of this character, among the<br />
<br />
. fishes, are the gar, dog-fish, pike, and Etheostomine<br />
<br />
perch, an extensive group of small fishes without<br />
swim-bladders, found in all streams.<br />
<br />
There are certain climatal divisions of the fauna<br />
of the Eastern district of North America, regulated<br />
by the elevation of the surface, the latitude, temper-<br />
ature, ete. These have been named the Floridian,<br />
the Louisianian, the Carolinian, the Alleghanion, the<br />
Canadian, the Hudsonian, ete. Maryland is traversed<br />
by the Carolinian, the Alleghanian, and the Cana-<br />
dian, and their boundaries separate the breeding-<br />
places of various species of birds, and range of others,<br />
of mammals, ete.<br />
<br />
The greater part of the area of the State, that s,<br />
the low countries from the ocean to the Potomac and<br />
to the line extending from Wilmington to Baltimoroe<br />
and to Washington, D. C., is the especial range<br />
of the mocking-bird, the blue grossbeak, the summer<br />
red-bird (Lyranga wstiva), and others. Also of the<br />
pine meadow-mouse (Arvicola pinetorum), ete.<br />
<br />
The middle part of the State is occupied by the<br />
Alleghanian fauna, which extends north and south.<br />
The higher ridges of the Alleghany Mountains are<br />
included in the Canadian, as indicated by the breed-<br />
ing of the snow-bird, various warblers, and the range<br />
of some land animals. This fauna extends along the<br />
mountains to Georgia. Our State, then, presents a<br />
fine and prolific ficld to the student of Biological<br />
Science.<br />

THE CLIMATE OF MARYLAND.<br /><br />
—_————<br /><br />
By LORIN BLODGET,<br />
AUTHOR OF “AMERICAN CLIMATOLOGY,” ETC.<br /><br />
THE configuration of Maryland is very variable,<br />
giving a wide tract nearly at sea-level in the<br />
east and south, a moderately rolling district occupy-<br />
ing the central part of the State, and a sharply cle-<br />
vated mountainous belt crossing the summits of the<br />
Alleghanies in the west. The climate has, therefore,<br />
a wide range, from the soft maritime air of the At-<br />
lantic coast, along the eastern shore, to the compara-<br />
tively cold and severe atmosphere of the mountain<br />
counties. The south-eastern extremity of the State<br />
has the broad Chesapeake Bay to moderate its ex-<br />
tremes,-as well as the Atlantic coast and the not<br />
remote Gulf Stream. It is, therefore, much like<br />
Norfolk and the Carolina coasts, and but little be-<br />
yond the range of the live-oak and the cotton- and<br />
rice-fields. Yet none of these are quite successful<br />
within its limits. The summer heats of the interior<br />
are greatly tempered here, and in many respects the<br />
climate is delightful. Inland, and on leaving the<br />
shores of the Chesapeake Bay, the extremes of heat<br />
and cold alike are greater, and such as generally<br />
belong to the latitude. Altogether, Maryland has a<br />
climate sensibly warmer and softer than the average<br />
of the States of the Atlantic coast.<br /><br />
In the central part of the State the range of single<br />
extremes is great, and may be stated at 10° below<br />
zero for the lowest, and 100° above for the greatest<br />
heats of summer. In the country about Baltimore<br />
and Washington such is the range : extremes ot 100°<br />
in summer have been several times recorded, one<br />
such instance occurring in June, 1853 ; while records<br />
of 95° to 98° are quite frequent, and may be ex-<br />
pected every summer. These extremes are not<br />
greater, however, than is every year experienced as<br />
far north as New England, though a greater number<br />
of hot days will be observed in Maryland. During<br />
these heats the atmosphere is usually more dry and<br />
clastic than further north. As to cold extremes,<br />
observations as low as 10° below zero have been re-<br />
corded at Washington, and sometimes a period of<br />
continuous cold occurs, covering the ground with<br />
snow for two or three months. 1In 1856-7 such se-<br />
verity prevailed from January to March, the use of<br />
sleighs being constant at Washington and Baltimore.<br />
Ice formed to the depth of twelve or fifteen inches<br />
on the Potomac River, and on the shallow arms of<br />
Chesapeake Bay. DBut such severity is rare, and<br /><br />
“may be expected only at intervals of about twenty-<br />
five years. Generally, the winters are open and<br />
mild, without much snow, and with very little ice.<br />
A larger share of fair weather prevails at this season<br />
than in any States northward.<br /><br />
The average temperature for the year at Balti-<br />
more is 54°, being three degrees warmer than New<br />
York city, and one and a half degrees warmer than<br />
Philadelphia. The isothermal lines recede much on<br />
the mountains, however, while they advance to but<br /><br />
little higher figures in the maritime districts. The<br />
summer mean at Baltimore is 75°, being two and a<br />
half degrees warmer than New York, and one degree<br />
warmer than Philadelphia. The winter average is<br />
34° at Baltimore, being two and a half degrees<br />
warmer than New York, and nearly one and a half<br />
degrees warmer than Philadelphia. In the extreme<br />
southeast the winter average rises five degrees higher,<br />
being nearly as warm as Norfolk, which is 40° for<br />
the winter. At Crisfield, Snow Hill, and Salisbury,<br />
this mild winter climate is conspicuous, as also in<br />
St. Mary’s County, west of the Bay. At Frederick,<br />
in the western central part of the State, the climate<br />
is that of Philadelphia, very nearly. Further west,<br />
and among the mountain valleys, the averages are<br />
nearly those of Pittsburgh, though colder in the<br />
higher districts. No records exist for these more<br /><br />
-<br /><br /><br /><br />
elevated localities : they are identical in -climate, as<br />
in configuration, with the mountains of Pennsylvania<br />
and Virginia.<br /><br />
The quantity of rain falling on the eastern shore,<br />
within the cooling influence of the Atlantic, is only<br />
about 42 inches; but inland, and along the borders<br />
of Chesapeake Bay, the quantity rises to 46 inches<br />
nearly. Rains are here conspicuous for the quantity<br />
falling in single storms, though no greater number<br />
of storms or proportion of cloudy weather exists,<br />
than in other districts where a less aggregate depth<br />
falls. In the range from Baltimore to Washington<br /><br />
the quantity falhng is about 44 inches. Then it falls<br /><br />
off to 42 inches, and again to 40 on the eastern slope<br />
of the mountains, with but 38 in the higher localities.<br />
Nearer the Ohio River the quantity increases again,<br />
but this is beyond the boundary of Maryland.<br /><br />
Great as is the quantity of rain falling, the atmos-<br />
phere is free from excessive humidity or great sen-<br />
sible saturation. The proportion of fair and fine<br />
weather is large at all seasons, probably one-third<br />
to one-half greater than in the latitude of New York.<br />
The increase in aggregate depth of rain is due to the<br />
great quantities falling in single storms. These<br />
heavy rains cause frequent floods in the streams and<br />
rivers of the State, particularly in spring and early<br />
summer. The range in the quantity of water falling<br />
in a single month may be from a mere fraction of<br />
an inch to sixteen inches; and in extreme years the<br />
quantity for one year may amount to twice as much<br />
as falls in a dry year.<br /><br />
As has been said, however, the atmosphere is not<br />
saturated or unhealthy from this large rain-fall. The<br />
general climate is bracing and healthy; the low and<br />
marshy borders of the Bay and of the streams of<br />
the east afford local malaria, but not of a severe or<br />
dangerous character. Nor is the State liable to<br />
dangerous fevers, or other diseases of tropical cli-<br />
mates.<br /><br />
The following tabular statements illustrate the<br />
averages of temperature and of the quantity of rain<br />
falling in Maryland, within a reasonably near ap-<br />
proximation, yet they are not as full as they should<br />
be, and need to be supplemented by observations<br />
taken within the limits of other States. The aver-<br />
ages of temperature are relatively more full, and the<br />
determinations more exact than those of the quantity<br />
of rain. The range in extreme years is not so great<br />
as to obscure the result, even if a very limited period<br />
is embraced; while with observations of the quan-<br />
tity of rain, the range in extreme years is such as to<br />
render positive determinations difficult with less<br />
than twenty years of continuous observation. There<br />
is also frequent deficiency in the quantity recorded,<br />
the excess in heavy rains not being all included, and<br />
snow not being melted, or estimated for. The po-<br />
sition of the instruments must also be carefully<br />
adjusted, to make the record full. The records at<br />
the military post at Baltimore, and all the stations<br />
at Washington, are probably deficient in quantity.<br /><br />
The great range in temperature between extreme<br />
months or seasons may be illustrated by citations<br />
from the record at Fort McHenry, Baltimore, where<br />
we have twenty-nine years of continuous observa-<br />
tion, 1831 to 1859.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

At Fredenck the coldest month recorded was Jan-<br />
uary, 1867, at 20°; and, generally, positions inland<br />
are colder by three to five degrees in winter months<br /><br /><br /><br />
than Baltimore. The coldest months recorded in<br />
Maryland in winter were in 1831, 1856, and 1857;<br />
the coldest summers in 1836, 1840, 1842, and 1846.<br />
The coldest years were 1836, 1840, 1841, and 1843.<br /><br />
The tables of quantity of rain cannot be so well<br />
compared, because of their greater liability to error.<br />
For twenty-four years of observation at Baltimore,<br />
Fort McHenry, the highest quantity in any month<br />
is 10} inches, and the least ;3 of an inch. At An-<br />
napolis, as high as 14} mches have been recorded in<br />
a month, and at other stations a maximum of 101 to<br />
13 inches has been recorded.<br /><br />

THE CLIMATE OF MARYLAND.<br />
<br />
—_————<br />
<br />
By LORIN BLODGET,<br />
AUTHOR OF “AMERICAN CLIMATOLOGY,” ETC.<br />
<br />
THE configuration of Maryland is very variable,<br />
giving a wide tract nearly at sea-level in the<br />
east and south, a moderately rolling district occupy-<br />
ing the central part of the State, and a sharply cle-<br />
vated mountainous belt crossing the summits of the<br />
Alleghanies in the west. The climate has, therefore,<br />
a wide range, from the soft maritime air of the At-<br />
lantic coast, along the eastern shore, to the compara-<br />
tively cold and severe atmosphere of the mountain<br />
counties. The south-eastern extremity of the State<br />
has the broad Chesapeake Bay to moderate its ex-<br />
tremes,-as well as the Atlantic coast and the not<br />
remote Gulf Stream. It is, therefore, much like<br />
Norfolk and the Carolina coasts, and but little be-<br />
yond the range of the live-oak and the cotton- and<br />
rice-fields. Yet none of these are quite successful<br />
within its limits. The summer heats of the interior<br />
are greatly tempered here, and in many respects the<br />
climate is delightful. Inland, and on leaving the<br />
shores of the Chesapeake Bay, the extremes of heat<br />
and cold alike are greater, and such as generally<br />
belong to the latitude. Altogether, Maryland has a<br />
climate sensibly warmer and softer than the average<br />
of the States of the Atlantic coast.<br />
<br />
In the central part of the State the range of single<br />
extremes is great, and may be stated at 10° below<br />
zero for the lowest, and 100° above for the greatest<br />
heats of summer. In the country about Baltimore<br />
and Washington such is the range : extremes ot 100°<br />
in summer have been several times recorded, one<br />
such instance occurring in June, 1853 ; while records<br />
of 95° to 98° are quite frequent, and may be ex-<br />
pected every summer. These extremes are not<br />
greater, however, than is every year experienced as<br />
far north as New England, though a greater number<br />
of hot days will be observed in Maryland. During<br />
these heats the atmosphere is usually more dry and<br />
clastic than further north. As to cold extremes,<br />
observations as low as 10° below zero have been re-<br />
corded at Washington, and sometimes a period of<br />
continuous cold occurs, covering the ground with<br />
snow for two or three months. 1In 1856-7 such se-<br />
verity prevailed from January to March, the use of<br />
sleighs being constant at Washington and Baltimore.<br />
Ice formed to the depth of twelve or fifteen inches<br />
on the Potomac River, and on the shallow arms of<br />
Chesapeake Bay. DBut such severity is rare, and<br />
<br />
“may be expected only at intervals of about twenty-<br />
five years. Generally, the winters are open and<br />
mild, without much snow, and with very little ice.<br />
A larger share of fair weather prevails at this season<br />
than in any States northward.<br />
<br />
The average temperature for the year at Balti-<br />
more is 54°, being three degrees warmer than New<br />
York city, and one and a half degrees warmer than<br />
Philadelphia. The isothermal lines recede much on<br />
the mountains, however, while they advance to but<br />
<br />
little higher figures in the maritime districts. The<br />
summer mean at Baltimore is 75°, being two and a<br />
half degrees warmer than New York, and one degree<br />
warmer than Philadelphia. The winter average is<br />
34° at Baltimore, being two and a half degrees<br />
warmer than New York, and nearly one and a half<br />
degrees warmer than Philadelphia. In the extreme<br />
southeast the winter average rises five degrees higher,<br />
being nearly as warm as Norfolk, which is 40° for<br />
the winter. At Crisfield, Snow Hill, and Salisbury,<br />
this mild winter climate is conspicuous, as also in<br />
St. Mary’s County, west of the Bay. At Frederick,<br />
in the western central part of the State, the climate<br />
is that of Philadelphia, very nearly. Further west,<br />
and among the mountain valleys, the averages are<br />
nearly those of Pittsburgh, though colder in the<br />
higher districts. No records exist for these more<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
elevated localities : they are identical in -climate, as<br />
in configuration, with the mountains of Pennsylvania<br />
and Virginia.<br />
<br />
The quantity of rain falling on the eastern shore,<br />
within the cooling influence of the Atlantic, is only<br />
about 42 inches; but inland, and along the borders<br />
of Chesapeake Bay, the quantity rises to 46 inches<br />
nearly. Rains are here conspicuous for the quantity<br />
falling in single storms, though no greater number<br />
of storms or proportion of cloudy weather exists,<br />
than in other districts where a less aggregate depth<br />
falls. In the range from Baltimore to Washington<br />
<br />
the quantity falhng is about 44 inches. Then it falls<br />
<br />
off to 42 inches, and again to 40 on the eastern slope<br />
of the mountains, with but 38 in the higher localities.<br />
Nearer the Ohio River the quantity increases again,<br />
but this is beyond the boundary of Maryland.<br />
<br />
Great as is the quantity of rain falling, the atmos-<br />
phere is free from excessive humidity or great sen-<br />
sible saturation. The proportion of fair and fine<br />
weather is large at all seasons, probably one-third<br />
to one-half greater than in the latitude of New York.<br />
The increase in aggregate depth of rain is due to the<br />
great quantities falling in single storms. These<br />
heavy rains cause frequent floods in the streams and<br />
rivers of the State, particularly in spring and early<br />
summer. The range in the quantity of water falling<br />
in a single month may be from a mere fraction of<br />
an inch to sixteen inches; and in extreme years the<br />
quantity for one year may amount to twice as much<br />
as falls in a dry year.<br />
<br />
As has been said, however, the atmosphere is not<br />
saturated or unhealthy from this large rain-fall. The<br />
general climate is bracing and healthy; the low and<br />
marshy borders of the Bay and of the streams of<br />
the east afford local malaria, but not of a severe or<br />
dangerous character. Nor is the State liable to<br />
dangerous fevers, or other diseases of tropical cli-<br />
mates.<br />
<br />
The following tabular statements illustrate the<br />
averages of temperature and of the quantity of rain<br />
falling in Maryland, within a reasonably near ap-<br />
proximation, yet they are not as full as they should<br />
be, and need to be supplemented by observations<br />
taken within the limits of other States. The aver-<br />
ages of temperature are relatively more full, and the<br />
determinations more exact than those of the quantity<br />
of rain. The range in extreme years is not so great<br />
as to obscure the result, even if a very limited period<br />
is embraced; while with observations of the quan-<br />
tity of rain, the range in extreme years is such as to<br />
render positive determinations difficult with less<br />
than twenty years of continuous observation. There<br />
is also frequent deficiency in the quantity recorded,<br />
the excess in heavy rains not being all included, and<br />
snow not being melted, or estimated for. The po-<br />
sition of the instruments must also be carefully<br />
adjusted, to make the record full. The records at<br />
the military post at Baltimore, and all the stations<br />
at Washington, are probably deficient in quantity.<br />
<br />
The great range in temperature between extreme<br />
months or seasons may be illustrated by citations<br />
from the record at Fort McHenry, Baltimore, where<br />
we have twenty-nine years of continuous observa-<br />
tion, 1831 to 1859.<br />

At Fredenck the coldest month recorded was Jan-<br />
uary, 1867, at 20°; and, generally, positions inland<br />
are colder by three to five degrees in winter months<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
than Baltimore. The coldest months recorded in<br />
Maryland in winter were in 1831, 1856, and 1857;<br />
the coldest summers in 1836, 1840, 1842, and 1846.<br />
The coldest years were 1836, 1840, 1841, and 1843.<br />
<br />
The tables of quantity of rain cannot be so well<br />
compared, because of their greater liability to error.<br />
For twenty-four years of observation at Baltimore,<br />
Fort McHenry, the highest quantity in any month<br />
is 10} inches, and the least ;3 of an inch. At An-<br />
napolis, as high as 14} mches have been recorded in<br />
a month, and at other stations a maximum of 101 to<br />
13 inches has been recorded.<br />

EDUCATION.<br /><br /><br /><br />
22<br />
EDUCATION. this province, which has succeeded with such de- | aggrieved party; and the tax before‘mentioned, im-<br />
s sired effect, that it is now thought necessary and is | posed on ¢Irish servants being Papists,” was con-<br /><br />
HE interest manifested by the people of Mary-<br />
land with regard to education dates back to Co-<br />
lonial times. The first general free-school law was a<br />
- petitionary Act, passed in 1696, of which the first<br />
section reads as follows: “ And may it be enacted<br />
by the King’s most excellent majesty, by and with<br />
the advice, prayer, and consent of this present Gen-<br />
eral Assembly, and the authority of the same, that<br />
for the propagation of the gospel and the education<br />
of the youth of this province in good letters and<br />
manners, that a certain place or places for a free<br />
- school or schools, or place of study of Latin, Greek,<br />
Writing, and the like, consisting of one master, one<br />
usher, and one writing-master or scribe to a school<br /><br />
and one hundred scholars, more or less, according to<br /><br />
the ability of the said free school, may be made,<br />
erected, founded, propagated, and established, under<br />
your royal patronage. And that the most reverend<br />
father in God, Thomas, by Divine Providence Arch-<br />
bishop of Canterbury, primate and Metropolitan of<br />
all England, may be chancellor of the said schools;<br />
and that, to perpetuate the memory of your Majesty,<br />
it may be called King William’s School, etc., ete.”<br />
(This school is still in existence under the name of<br />
St. John’s College.) The Act goes on to provide<br />
~ that as soon as the income of King William’s School<br />
“amounts to one hundred and twenty pounds sterling<br />
per annum, the trustees shall proceed to erect a<br />
gecond free school “at the town of Oxford, on the<br />
eastern shore of this province.” ¢“And also, after<br />
~ the second free school is built, erected, founded, and<br />
furnished, the said rectors, governors, and visitors<br />
 shall, as fast as they shall be enabled as aforesaid,<br />
proceed to the erecting of other and more free<br />
schools in this province; that is to say, in every<br /><br />
prayed that it may be enacted, etc., etc.” The law<br />
goes on to enact that a free school shall be estab-<br />
lished in each county, under the superintendence<br />
and control of what we may call a “State Board of<br />
Education,” the members of which are specified by<br />
name in the Act. This Board is required to meet<br />
four times a year, at least; and, among other things,<br />
they are directed to ¢ take all proper methods for the<br />
encouraging good schoolmasters that shall be mem-<br />
bers of the Church of England, and of pious and<br />
exemplary lives and conversations, and capable of<br />
teaching well the grammar, good writing, and the<br />
mathematics, if such can conveniently be got, and<br />
that they allow every such master for his encourage-<br />
ment for the present (besides the benefit and use of<br />
his plantation) [fifty acres], the sum of twenty pounds<br />
per annum.” Under this Act several schools were<br />
established, some of which survive to the present<br />
day; but the funds allowed by law were too small<br />
and too uncertain to produce anything like a general<br />
free-school system. Among other sources of income<br />
we find that clerks not writing a legible hand are to<br />
pay 2,000 1bs. of tobacco, one-half to go to the free-<br />
school fund; the owner of hogs running at large is<br />
to pay 100 lbs. of tobacco to the pubhc schools;<br />
the owner of geese running at large is to pay ten<br />
shillings to the school fund; the fine for sell-<br />
ing liquor within three miles of Friends’ Yearly<br />
Meeting is five pounds, of which one-half is to go<br />
to the public schools; the fine for harboring slaves<br />
is 100 1bs. of tobacco per hour, one-half to be given<br />
to the public schools, and the other half to the<br /><br />
\<br /><br /><br /><br />
tinued (at least on the statute book) till near the<br />
Revolution.<br /><br />
The Revolutionary War proved a serious obstacle<br />
to the progress of education. At its close, many of<br />
the county academies began to show symptoms of<br />
decay; and before the end of the eighteenth cen-<br />
tury, the free-school fund in several counties was<br />
transferred to the commissioners of the poor. Up<br />
to the year 1865, no general system of free schools<br />
was in operation, though every county had a system<br />
(more or less efficient) of its own, supported to a<br />
very limited extent by a State Fund, but mainly by<br />
local taxation. In 1865, the present system, of which<br />
Maryland is justly proud, was inaugurated upon the<br />
basis of the grand principle that the property of the<br />
State shall be held responsible for the education of<br />
the children of the State.<br /><br />
Among many noble men to whose exertions the -<br />
people of Maryland owe this great triumph, two<br />
may be named as most conspicuous— Joseph M.<br />
Cushing, Chairman of the Committee of Education<br />
in the Constitutional Convention of 1864, and Li-<br />
bertus Van Bokkelen, first State Superintendent of<br />
Public Instruction. Three successive legislatures<br />
have made many changes in the original school law,<br />
but the main features are still preserved, — &lt; Educa-<br />
tion absolutely free, and an open highway in which<br /><br />
- who will may walk from the Primary School to the<br /><br />
University.” The last change of importance was<br />
made in 1872, and placed the schools for colored<br />
children on the same footing and under the same<br />
regulations as schools for white children.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

RAILWAYS AND CANALS.<br /><br />
———0-0 @ 00——<br /><br />
N 1784 a company was formed for the purpose of<br />
constructing a canal from the Pennsylvania line,<br />
along the Susquehanna to tide-water, and incor-<br />
porated under the name of ¢ The Proprietors of<br />
the Susquehanna Canal.”<br /><br />
To render the Potomac River navigable, ¢ The<br />
Potomaec Company ” was formed in the same year,<br />
and General Washington was chosen its first presi-<br />
dent. So deep was the interest which he took in<br />
this great design, that he assisted in the survey of<br />
the river in person. It was then supposed that the<br />
Potomac could be rendered navigable by locks and<br />
dams and short canals, and the works for this pur-<br />
pose were very soon undertaken; but experience<br />
proved the fallacy of the idea. When the Potomac<br />
Company was subsequently merged in the Chesa-<br />
peake and Ohio Canal Co., these works were<br />
abandoned, and a more comprehensive plan adopted,<br />
that a more speedy and reliable means of communi-<br />
cation might be had with the rich iron mines and<br />
inexhaustible supply of coal contained in the moun-<br />
tains of Western Maryland.<br /><br />
At a convention of delegates, from different<br />
counties in Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania,<br />
held in Washington, Nov. 6, 18238, it was resolved<br />
to form a company to construct a canal from<br />
Georgetown, D. C., by Cumberland, to the coal<br />
banks on the eastern side of the Alleghanies, and<br />
thence to the highest point of navigation on the<br />
Ohio or Monongahela.<br /><br />
The Ohio and Chesapeake Canal Co. was incor-<br />
porated by act of the Legislature of Virginia, Jan.<br />
27, 1824, and the charter was accepted by the stock-<br />
holders, and the company formally organized in<br />
June, 1828, and the work of construction com-<br />
menced the same year. The canal was completed<br />
in 1845, and is for the greater part from sixty to<br />
seventy feet wide and six feet deep. The rise in a<br />
distance of one hundred and five miles, from<br />
Geprgetown to Williamsport, is three hundred and<br />
fifty-three feet, which is overcome by forty-four<br />
locks, one hundred feet long, by fifteen feet wide.<br />
There are in this distance one hundred and nine-<br />
teen culverts and six aqueducts, all built in the<br />
most substantial manner, of solid stone masonry.<br /><br />
Maryland, looking to the interests of its com-<br />
mercial metropolis, claimed and obtained the right<br />
of constructing, through any portion of the District<br />
of Columbia, a lateral canal, to terminate at the<br />
city of Baltimore, and further insisted upon the<br />
power, and maintained the expediency of the gen-<br />
eral Government’s fostering this great national work<br />
and aiding in its completion.<br /><br />
Owing to doubts of the feasibility of constructing<br />
the lateral canal, and the evident necessity of open-<br />
ing a more direct and speedy means of communi-<br />
cation, the people of Baltimore, at an early day,<br />
determined upon the construction of a railroad to<br />
the waters of the Ohio. In February, 1827, a public<br />
meeting was called in the city, and a memorial pre-<br />
ferred at once to the Legislature. It was asserted<br />
that the route of the railroad was the only practicable<br />
one, that it was shorter by one hundred and forty<br />
miles than the proposed canal, and that it could be<br />
opened at an expense less by seven millions of<br />
dollars. In ten days after the application, a charter<br />
was granted by the Legislature.<br /><br />
The Annaroris ANp Erx Ripge RarLroaD, ex-<br />
tending from Annapolis to Annapolis Junction, —<br />
a point on the Washington branch of the Baltimore<br />
and Obhio Railroad, —was completed in the year<br />
1840, its length being 22:51 miles. For the<br />
promotion of this enterprise, the State subscribed<br />
the sum of $300,000 in bonds, of which $219,378<br />
were issued. As a paying investment, this road<br />
has not been a success, as it has probably never<br />
earned more than would cover its operating ex-<br />
penses,<br /><br /><br /><br />
The BaLriMore AND DruM Poixt RAILROAD, now<br />
in course of construction, is to extend from Balti-<br />
more in a southerly direction to Drum Point, in<br />
Calvert County, a distance of about seventy miles.<br /><br />
The BarrimorE AND Onro Rarnroap CoMpANY was<br />
incorporated in the State of Maryland, on the 28th<br />
of February, 1827, with authority to construct a<br />
railroad from Baltimore to some eligible point on<br />
the Ohio River. With a capital of $5,000,000, and<br />
the required subscription being raised, which was<br />
one-fifth of that amount, the Company was organized<br />
in the following April. After a satisfactory report<br />
of the surveys, the construction was commenced,<br />
and the ground broken at Baltimore on the 4th of<br />
July, 1828. In a short time the first section of the<br />
road, extending to Ellicott’s Mills, a distance of<br />
fourteen miles, was put under contract, and com-<br />
pleted in 1830. In this same year there was a sec-<br />
tion of the road constructed within the city limits.<br /><br />
The year 1832 found the road extended to the<br />
Point of Rocks, a distance of eight miles. In 1833<br />
the work of construction was suspended, and no<br />
additional mileage was added; but in the following<br />
year it was again resumed, and the route extended<br />
beyond the Point of Rocks, a distance of twelve<br />
miles, to Harper’s Ferry.<br /><br />
In 1836 surveys were made for the extension of<br />
the main road to Cumberland and Wheeling, for<br />
which purpose $3,200,000 were subsequently sub-<br />
scribed by the State.<br /><br />
At an early period in the history of the Company,<br />
permission had been obtained from Virginia for the<br />
location of the road through a portion of its terri-<br />
tory. The time having elapsed in which the road<br />
was to have been constructed, an act was passed,<br />
1838, extending the time to five years, and requiring<br />
the Company to locate within the State, with the<br />
exception of five miles, —its road from Harper’s<br />
Ferry to Cumberland. This act also designated the<br />
city of Wheeling as the western terminus of thé<br />
road. At the same time the State made a sub-<br />
scription to the capital stock of the Company to the<br />
amount of $1,058,420, being one-fifth of the esti-<br />
mated cost of the road within its limits.<br /><br />
This act was accepted by the Company, and the<br />
line to Cumberland, a distance of ninety - seven<br />
miles, was placed under countract, and completed<br />
in November, 1842,<br /><br />
No progress had been made in the construction<br />
of the road beyond Cumberland from 1842 to 1847,<br />
as the authority granted by the State of Virginia<br />
had again expired. In 1847, an extension of time<br />
was again obtained. In 1849, the means for re-<br />
suming the work were provided, by the negotiation<br />
of the bonds of the State granted to the Company.<br />
From that date the work progressed rapidly, and in<br />
1851 the road was extended from Cumberland to<br />
Piedmont, a distance of twenty-eight miles; in<br />
1852, from Piedmont to Fairmont, ninety-six miles;<br />
and in the year 1853 the whole line of the road from<br />
Baltimore to Wheeling, 1 distance of three hundred<br />
and cighty miles, was opened to public use.<br /><br />
The BarriMore AND Poromac RATLROAD was char-<br />
tered by the Maryland Legislature, May 6, 1853, to<br />
extend from some point in or near the city of Bal-<br />
timore, to a point on the Potomac River, to be<br />
selected by the President and Directors of said<br />
Company, not higher than Liverpool Point, and not<br />
lower than St. Mary’s River, with such branches at<br />
any point on said Railroad, not exceeding twenty<br />
miles in length, as the said President and Directors<br />
may determine.<br /><br />
The terminating points are Baltimore and Pope’s<br />
Creek, on the Potomac River. The distance from<br />
the Calvert Street Station, Baltimore, to Pope’s<br />
Creek, is 74:20 miles.<br /><br />
Its Washington branch leaves the main stem at<br />
Bowie, Prince George’s County, Md., 2552 miles<br />
from Calvert Street Station, Baltimore, and ter-<br />
minates near the capitol in Washington, a distance<br />
of 17-08 miles.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Both cities are entered by tunnels; that in Balti-<br />
more being nearly a mile and a half in length, and<br />
costing over a million and a half of dollars.<br /><br />
Scarcely anything was done under the charter,<br />
except a survey by Gen. Trimble, until late in 1860,<br />
when its present president was elected a director,<br />
and subsequently president. Ie at once addressed<br />
himself with encrgy to the building of the road.<br /><br />
In the spring of 1861 contracts were made for<br />
building the lower portion of the line to the An-<br />
napolis and Elk Ridge Railroad, putting southern<br />
Maryland in connection with Baltimore by rail, over<br />
the Annapolis and Elk Ridge, and Washington<br />
Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad; but<br />
the breaking out of the war precluded any work<br />
being accomplished.<br /><br />
The war being over, the project was revived, and,<br />
notwithstanding the violent and powerful opposition .<br />
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co., the entire<br />
line has been built, and is now in successful opera-<br />
tion. It has been constructed of the very best<br />
material, of the heaviest iron, and the largest oak-<br />
ties, and its equipment is of the first character.<br /><br />
It was opened for travel between Baltimore and<br />
Washington the second day of July, 1872, with six<br />
passenger trains each way daily, and is doing a<br />
good business from Lafayette, one of its suburban<br />
Baltimore stations, to its depot in Washington.<br />
The tunnel will be completed by April, 1873, when<br />
trains will run, not only into the very centre of<br />
Baltimore, but, through travel east and west, north<br />
and south, will be transported through and under the<br />
city by steam, without any delay or change of cars.<br /><br />
The CoLumpia aANp Port DEPostT RAILROAD is in<br />
process of construction, and will extend, when<br />
completed, along the left bank of the Susquehanna<br />
River, from Port Deposit, Md., to Columbia, Pa., a<br />
distance of 89,3 miles, 10 8 being in Maryland, and<br />
28% in Pennsylvania.<br /><br />
About five miles of the main track have been<br />
completed, forming a connection from the present<br />
southern terminus of the Philadelphia and Balti-<br />
more Central Railroad, at the mouth of the Octo-<br />
rora Creek, and the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and<br />
Baltimore Branch from Perrysville to Port Deposit,<br />
and is operated by the P., W., &amp; B. RR. Co. The<br />
entire line, it is expected, will be open for traffic in<br />
the fall of 1873, and, when completed, will form<br />
another great outlet for coal, running direct to tide-<br />
water, with all grades favorable for the loaded<br />
trains.<br /><br />
The CuMBERLAND AND PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD<br />
was chartered on the 138th of March, 1850, and ex-<br />
tends from Cumberland, Md., to Piedmont, W.<br />
Va., a distance of thirty-four miles.<br /><br />
The lateral lines are Eckhart Branch, 14 miles;<br />
Neff Run, Midlothian, Consolidation, and Furnace<br />
branches, each 1} to 1} miles in length. Also,<br />
Branch Line, 2} miles from Krugbaum’s (4 miles<br />
from Cumberland) to Pennsylvania State line,<br />
where it will join the Bedford and Bridgeport<br />
Road, which in turn connects with the Huntingdon<br />
and Broad Top Road, terminating at Huntingdon,<br />
on the Pennsylvania Central Road.<br /><br />
The Cumberland and Pennsylvania Road was<br />
built from Cumberland to Mt. Savage in 1844, to<br />
Frostburg in 1852, and in 1857 to Lonaconing. In<br />
1863 the George’s Creek Road, running from Lona-<br />
coning to Piedmont, W. Va., was purchased, thus<br />
completing the line throughout the centre of the<br />
Cumberland coal-field, a distance of thirty-four<br />
miles.<br /><br />
The CuMBERLAND VALLEY RAILROAD extends from<br />
Hagerstown to Harrisburg, Pa., a distance of sev-<br />
enty-four miles; only 575 of it lying within the<br />
State of Maryland. This road was chartered on<br />
the 2d of April, 1831. The work of construction<br />
commenced in January, 1836, and the road was<br />
completed from Chambersburg to the Susquehanna<br />
River opposite Harrisburg, in December, 1887, a<br />
distance of forty-nine miles.<br />","BATLWAYS AND UANALS<br />

Company was subsequently merged in the Chesa-<br />
peake and Ohio Canal Co., these works were<br />
abandoned, and a more comprehensive plan adopted,<br />
that a more speedy and reliable means of communi-<br />
cation might be had with the rich iron mines and<br />
inexhaustible supply of coal contained in the moun-<br />
tains of Western Maryland.<br />
<br />
At a convention of delegates, from different<br />
counties in Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania,<br />
held in Washington, Nov. 6, 18238, it was resolved<br />
to form a company to construct a canal from<br />
Georgetown, D. C., by Cumberland, to the coal<br />
banks on the eastern side of the Alleghanies, and<br />
thence to the highest point of navigation on the<br />
Ohio or Monongahela.<br />
<br />
The Ohio and Chesapeake Canal Co. was incor-<br />
porated by act of the Legislature of Virginia, Jan.<br />
27, 1824, and the charter was accepted by the stock-<br />
holders, and the company formally organized in<br />
June, 1828, and the work of construction com-<br />
menced the same year. The canal was completed<br />
in 1845, and is for the greater part from sixty to<br />
seventy feet wide and six feet deep. The rise in a<br />
distance of one hundred and five miles, from<br />
Geprgetown to Williamsport, is three hundred and<br />
fifty-three feet, which is overcome by forty-four<br />
locks, one hundred feet long, by fifteen feet wide.<br />
There are in this distance one hundred and nine-<br />
teen culverts and six aqueducts, all built in the<br />
most substantial manner, of solid stone masonry.<br />
<br />
Maryland, looking to the interests of its com-<br />
mercial metropolis, claimed and obtained the right<br />
of constructing, through any portion of the District<br />
of Columbia, a lateral canal, to terminate at the<br />
city of Baltimore, and further insisted upon the<br />
power, and maintained the expediency of the gen-<br />
eral Government’s fostering this great national work<br />
and aiding in its completion.<br />
<br />
Owing to doubts of the feasibility of constructing<br />
the lateral canal, and the evident necessity of open-<br />
ing a more direct and speedy means of communi-<br />
cation, the people of Baltimore, at an early day,<br />
determined upon the construction of a railroad to<br />
the waters of the Ohio. In February, 1827, a public<br />
meeting was called in the city, and a memorial pre-<br />
ferred at once to the Legislature. It was asserted<br />
that the route of the railroad was the only practicable<br />
one, that it was shorter by one hundred and forty<br />
miles than the proposed canal, and that it could be<br />
opened at an expense less by seven millions of<br />
dollars. In ten days after the application, a charter<br />
was granted by the Legislature.<br />
<br />
The Annaroris ANp Erx Ripge RarLroaD, ex-<br />
tending from Annapolis to Annapolis Junction, —<br />
a point on the Washington branch of the Baltimore<br />
and Obhio Railroad, —was completed in the year<br />
1840, its length being 22:51 miles. For the<br />
promotion of this enterprise, the State subscribed<br />
the sum of $300,000 in bonds, of which $219,378<br />
were issued. As a paying investment, this road<br />
has not been a success, as it has probably never<br />
earned more than would cover its operating ex-<br />
penses,<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The BaLriMore AND DruM Poixt RAILROAD, now<br />
in course of construction, is to extend from Balti-<br />
more in a southerly direction to Drum Point, in<br />
Calvert County, a distance of about seventy miles.<br />
<br />
The BarrimorE AND Onro Rarnroap CoMpANY was<br />
incorporated in the State of Maryland, on the 28th<br />
of February, 1827, with authority to construct a<br />
railroad from Baltimore to some eligible point on<br />
the Ohio River. With a capital of $5,000,000, and<br />
the required subscription being raised, which was<br />
one-fifth of that amount, the Company was organized<br />
in the following April. After a satisfactory report<br />
of the surveys, the construction was commenced,<br />
and the ground broken at Baltimore on the 4th of<br />
July, 1828. In a short time the first section of the<br />
road, extending to Ellicott’s Mills, a distance of<br />
fourteen miles, was put under contract, and com-<br />
pleted in 1830. In this same year there was a sec-<br />
tion of the road constructed within the city limits.<br />
<br />
The year 1832 found the road extended to the<br />
Point of Rocks, a distance of eight miles. In 1833<br />
the work of construction was suspended, and no<br />
additional mileage was added; but in the following<br />
year it was again resumed, and the route extended<br />
beyond the Point of Rocks, a distance of twelve<br />
miles, to Harper’s Ferry.<br />
<br />
In 1836 surveys were made for the extension of<br />
the main road to Cumberland and Wheeling, for<br />
which purpose $3,200,000 were subsequently sub-<br />
scribed by the State.<br />
<br />
At an early period in the history of the Company,<br />
permission had been obtained from Virginia for the<br />
location of the road through a portion of its terri-<br />
tory. The time having elapsed in which the road<br />
was to have been constructed, an act was passed,<br />
1838, extending the time to five years, and requiring<br />
the Company to locate within the State, with the<br />
exception of five miles, —its road from Harper’s<br />
Ferry to Cumberland. This act also designated the<br />
city of Wheeling as the western terminus of thé<br />
road. At the same time the State made a sub-<br />
scription to the capital stock of the Company to the<br />
amount of $1,058,420, being one-fifth of the esti-<br />
mated cost of the road within its limits.<br />
<br />
This act was accepted by the Company, and the<br />
line to Cumberland, a distance of ninety - seven<br />
miles, was placed under countract, and completed<br />
in November, 1842,<br />
<br />
No progress had been made in the construction<br />
of the road beyond Cumberland from 1842 to 1847,<br />
as the authority granted by the State of Virginia<br />
had again expired. In 1847, an extension of time<br />
was again obtained. In 1849, the means for re-<br />
suming the work were provided, by the negotiation<br />
of the bonds of the State granted to the Company.<br />
From that date the work progressed rapidly, and in<br />
1851 the road was extended from Cumberland to<br />
Piedmont, a distance of twenty-eight miles; in<br />
1852, from Piedmont to Fairmont, ninety-six miles;<br />
and in the year 1853 the whole line of the road from<br />
Baltimore to Wheeling, 1 distance of three hundred<br />
and cighty miles, was opened to public use.<br />
<br />
The BarriMore AND Poromac RATLROAD was char-<br />
tered by the Maryland Legislature, May 6, 1853, to<br />
extend from some point in or near the city of Bal-<br />
timore, to a point on the Potomac River, to be<br />
selected by the President and Directors of said<br />
Company, not higher than Liverpool Point, and not<br />
lower than St. Mary’s River, with such branches at<br />
any point on said Railroad, not exceeding twenty<br />
miles in length, as the said President and Directors<br />
may determine.<br />
<br />
The terminating points are Baltimore and Pope’s<br />
Creek, on the Potomac River. The distance from<br />
the Calvert Street Station, Baltimore, to Pope’s<br />
Creek, is 74:20 miles.<br />
<br />
Its Washington branch leaves the main stem at<br />
Bowie, Prince George’s County, Md., 2552 miles<br />
from Calvert Street Station, Baltimore, and ter-<br />
minates near the capitol in Washington, a distance<br />
of 17-08 miles.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Both cities are entered by tunnels; that in Balti-<br />
more being nearly a mile and a half in length, and<br />
costing over a million and a half of dollars.<br />
<br />
Scarcely anything was done under the charter,<br />
except a survey by Gen. Trimble, until late in 1860,<br />
when its present president was elected a director,<br />
and subsequently president. Ie at once addressed<br />
himself with encrgy to the building of the road.<br />
<br />
In the spring of 1861 contracts were made for<br />
building the lower portion of the line to the An-<br />
napolis and Elk Ridge Railroad, putting southern<br />
Maryland in connection with Baltimore by rail, over<br />
the Annapolis and Elk Ridge, and Washington<br />
Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad; but<br />
the breaking out of the war precluded any work<br />
being accomplished.<br />
<br />
The war being over, the project was revived, and,<br />
notwithstanding the violent and powerful opposition .<br />
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co., the entire<br />
line has been built, and is now in successful opera-<br />
tion. It has been constructed of the very best<br />
material, of the heaviest iron, and the largest oak-<br />
ties, and its equipment is of the first character.<br />
<br />
It was opened for travel between Baltimore and<br />
Washington the second day of July, 1872, with six<br />
passenger trains each way daily, and is doing a<br />
good business from Lafayette, one of its suburban<br />
Baltimore stations, to its depot in Washington.<br />
The tunnel will be completed by April, 1873, when<br />
trains will run, not only into the very centre of<br />
Baltimore, but, through travel east and west, north<br />
and south, will be transported through and under the<br />
city by steam, without any delay or change of cars.<br />
<br />
The CoLumpia aANp Port DEPostT RAILROAD is in<br />
process of construction, and will extend, when<br />
completed, along the left bank of the Susquehanna<br />
River, from Port Deposit, Md., to Columbia, Pa., a<br />
distance of 89,3 miles, 10 8 being in Maryland, and<br />
28% in Pennsylvania.<br />
<br />
About five miles of the main track have been<br />
completed, forming a connection from the present<br />
southern terminus of the Philadelphia and Balti-<br />
more Central Railroad, at the mouth of the Octo-<br />
rora Creek, and the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and<br />
Baltimore Branch from Perrysville to Port Deposit,<br />
and is operated by the P., W., & B. RR. Co. The<br />
entire line, it is expected, will be open for traffic in<br />
the fall of 1873, and, when completed, will form<br />
another great outlet for coal, running direct to tide-<br />
water, with all grades favorable for the loaded<br />
trains.<br />
<br />
The CuMBERLAND AND PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD<br />
was chartered on the 138th of March, 1850, and ex-<br />
tends from Cumberland, Md., to Piedmont, W.<br />
Va., a distance of thirty-four miles.<br />
<br />
The lateral lines are Eckhart Branch, 14 miles;<br />
Neff Run, Midlothian, Consolidation, and Furnace<br />
branches, each 1} to 1} miles in length. Also,<br />
Branch Line, 2} miles from Krugbaum’s (4 miles<br />
from Cumberland) to Pennsylvania State line,<br />
where it will join the Bedford and Bridgeport<br />
Road, which in turn connects with the Huntingdon<br />
and Broad Top Road, terminating at Huntingdon,<br />
on the Pennsylvania Central Road.<br />
<br />
The Cumberland and Pennsylvania Road was<br />
built from Cumberland to Mt. Savage in 1844, to<br />
Frostburg in 1852, and in 1857 to Lonaconing. In<br />
1863 the George’s Creek Road, running from Lona-<br />
coning to Piedmont, W. Va., was purchased, thus<br />
completing the line throughout the centre of the<br />
Cumberland coal-field, a distance of thirty-four<br />
miles.<br />
<br />
The CuMBERLAND VALLEY RAILROAD extends from<br />
Hagerstown to Harrisburg, Pa., a distance of sev-<br />
enty-four miles; only 575 of it lying within the<br />
State of Maryland. This road was chartered on<br />
the 2d of April, 1831. The work of construction<br />
commenced in January, 1836, and the road was<br />
completed from Chambersburg to the Susquehanna<br />
River opposite Harrisburg, in December, 1887, a<br />
distance of forty-nine miles.<br />

RATILWAYS AND CANALS<br /><br /><br /><br />
By an act of the Legislature, approved on the 2d<br />
of February, 1836, the Company was empowered to<br />
construct a bridge across the Susquehanna (4,400<br />
feet), and extend the road through Marrisburg to<br />
the Pennsylvania Canal, about three miles beyond<br />
the then eastern terminus, and also to connect with<br />
other roads centring at Harrisburg. 7his was the<br />
original Cumberland Valley Road. That portion<br />
from Chambersburg to Hagerstown was originally<br />
known as the Franklin Railroad.<br /><br />
This company was chartered in Pennsylvania, on<br />
the 12th of March, 1832, and in Maryland in the<br />
same year, and was authorized to construct.a road<br />
in continuation of the Cumberland Valley Railroad<br />
from Chambersburg to Hagerstown. The road was<br />
built in 1838, and after changing owners several<br />
times, finally came into the hands of the Cumber-<br />
land Valley Road, by which it is now operated.<br /><br />
The DorcHESTER AND DELAWARE RAILROAD runs<br />
from Cambridge, Md., to Seaford, Del., a distance<br />
of thirty-three miles, 5% miles of which are in the<br />
State of Delaware, and was built by the - Philadel-<br />
phia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad Com-<br />
pany, and leased to the Dorchester and Delaware<br />
Railroad Company.<br /><br />
The D. &amp; D. RR. Co. owns two locomotives, and<br />
hires the other rolling-stock from the P., W., &amp; B.<br />
RR. Co.<br /><br />
The first work on this road was commenced Oc-<br />
tober 23, 1867, and on November 8, 1869, it was<br />
opened for passengers and freight.<br /><br />
Seaford, the eastern terminus, is on the Delaware<br />
Railroad Line, and Cambridge, the western termi-<br />
nus, is on the south side of the Choptank River,<br />
twenty miles from its entrance into the Chesapeake<br />
Bay, and is the county-seat of Dorchester County.<br />
Steamers to and from Baltimore connect with the<br />
road at this point.<br /><br />
The EasteEry SHORE RAILROAD was chartered by<br />
the Maryland Legislature in the year 1853, and the<br />
company organized February 22d, 1859.<br /><br />
The road from Salisbury to Crisfield was built by<br />
George A. Parker, of Boston, Mass., under one con-<br />
tract, the work being commenced in August, 1865.<br />
In March, 1866, the road was opened for business to<br />
Princess Anne, and in October of the same year<br />
‘was opened to its terminus at Crisfield.<br /><br />
The entire length of the road from Crisfield to<br />
Delmar, a point on the dividing-line between the<br />
States of Maryland and Delaware, is thirty-eight<br />
miles; and at this point it becomes continuous with<br />
the Delaware Railroad.<br /><br />
The Eastern Shore Railroad hasseveral important<br />
connections, two of which are already completed,<br />
and another projected. The Wicomico and Poco-<br />
moke Railroad connects with it at Salisbury; the<br />
‘Worcester Railroad being connected by means of<br />
the Wicomico and Pocomoke. These roads traverse<br />
a rich and prosperous section of country, making<br />
them very important tributaries to the Eastern Shore<br />
Railroad ; the length of the two roads being about<br />
thirty-seven miles. '<br /><br />
The next important branch is the one leading<br />
from near Princess Anne to Newtown, a distance<br />
of nine miles. This road, just completed, may some<br />
day be continued, extending through the Eastern<br />
Shore counties in Virginia, of Accomac and North-<br />
ampton.<br /><br />
The Eastern Shore Railroad, with proposed ex-<br />
tensions, is, geographically, the most direct air-line<br />
route between the North and the South. The dis-<br />
tance from Crisfield to Norfolk, Va., by actual survey,<br />
is eighty-four miles, connecting at Norfolk with the<br />
Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad, and thence to<br />
Charleston, S. C., and other points South. The dis-<br />
tance between Charleston and New York can be<br />
made, over this route, about six hours quicker than<br />
by any other.<br /><br />
The projected connections are, (1.) The railroad to<br />
extend from West Point, on the York River, Va,<br />
to Pionkatank on the Chesapeake Bay, thence by<br /><br /><br /><br />
steam thirty-five miles to Crisfield; (2.) The Wash-<br />
ington and Point Lookout Railroad, from Washing-<br />
ton, D. C., to the mouth of the Potomac River at<br />
Point Lookout, in St. Mary’s County, Md., which<br />
road is now partly built, and is expected soon to be<br />
finished ; thence by steamer to Crisfield, a distance<br />
of thirty miles; and (3.) The Baltimore and Drum<br />
Point Railroad, extending from that point to Balti-<br />
more, and connecting by steamer from Drum Point<br />
to Cristield, a distance of forty-five miles.<br /><br />
The grades of the Eastern Shore Railroad are re-<br />
markably easy, and its direction nearly an air-line.<br />
At Delmar, its northern terminus, it is thirty-two fect<br />
above tide-water; at Salisbury, twenty-six; Princess<br />
Anne, fourteen; Kingston, twelve; Crisfield, its<br />
southern terminus, four —making twenty-eight feet<br />
in thirty-eight miles. The road is in a prosperous<br />
condition, and its business steadily increasing, and is<br />
surely destined to become a most important connect-<br />
ing-link between the Atlantic seaboard section of the<br />
South and the great cities of the North.<br /><br />
The KrxT CouNTY RAILROAD Was commenced in<br />
1869, and is now completed from Massey’s Cross<br />
Roads to a point five miles beyond Chestertown,<br />
near Belle Air, a distance of twenty-five miles.<br /><br />
There is a branch or lateral road, five-eighths of a<br />
mile long, from the depot in the precincts of Ches-<br />
tertown to Chester River. At the terminus on the<br />
river a fine substantial wharf has been erected. The<br />
direction through which the road passes is one of the<br />
finest agricultural sections in the country. It is in<br />
contemplation to extend the road from Belle Air to<br />
some point on the Chesapeake Bay, from which a<br />
steamer can run to Baltimore in 1§ hours.<br /><br />
In 1868, the Legislature of Maryland authorized<br />
the Delaware RR. Co. to construect a road from Mas-<br />
sey’s Cross Roads to the Delaware line, and the Del-<br />
aware Legislature authorized the same company to<br />
construct a road from some point on the Delaware<br />
TRailroad to meet the proposed road from Massey’s.<br />
In 1869 they constructed this road from Townsend, on<br />
the Delaware Road to Massey’s Cross Roads in<br />
Maryland. Thisis known as the Townsend Branch,<br />
and is ten miles long.<br /><br />
There is a railroad from Massey’s Cross Roads<br />
through Millington, in Kent, and through Queen<br />
Anne County to Centreville, about twenty miles in<br />
length, called the QuEEN ANNE AND KENT RATLROAD.<br />
This road and the Kent County Railroad lease the<br />
Townsend Branch,and thus have direct connections,<br />
through the Declaware Railroad, with all the main<br />
lines. :<br /><br />
About 9,000 passengers travelled over the Kent<br />
County Railroad in 1871. The businessisimproving,<br />
and, if the Bay connections are made, will increase<br />
still more. A telegraph is being constructed along<br />
the line.<br /><br />
The MARYLAND AND DELAWARE Ratnroap Co. was<br />
chartered in Maryland in the year 1854, and in the<br />
State of Delaware in 1857. This company was<br />
authorized to construct a road from Clayton, on the<br />
Delaware Railroad, to Oxford, on the Choptank, an<br />
arm of the Chesapeake Bay, a distance of fifty-four<br />
miles.<br /><br />
The work of construction was commenced on the<br />
27th of December, 1857, and was completed, with<br />
the exception of the pier, in 1871. The road has a<br />
length of fourteen miles in Delaware and forty in<br />
Maryland.<br /><br />
At its terminus on the Chesapeake Bay there is a<br />
fine and commodious harbor, from which a daily line<br />
of steamers runs to Baltimore; and one to Norfolk,<br />
Va., is proposed.<br /><br />
The MEerroroLiTAN BraNcH RAILR0OAD was char-<br />
tered in the District of Columbia by Congress on<br />
the 3d of March, 1853, and by the Legislature of<br />
Maryland on the 5th of April of the same year.<br />
The line of the road extends from Washington City<br />
to a junction with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad<br />
near Point of Rocks. Work was commenced in<br />
1854, and completed in 1872.<br /><br />
“Wilmington, and Baltimore.<br /><br /><br /><br />
The NorTnerN CENTRAL RATLROAD, extending from<br />
Baltimore, Md., to Sunbury, Pa., a distance of 138<br />
miles, was formed by the consolidation of several<br />
roads in Pennsylvania, and what was originally<br />
known as the Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad<br />
in Maryland.<br /><br />
The Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad Co. was<br />
chartered on the 13th of March, 1828, with authority<br />
to construct a road from Baltimore to the north line<br />
of the State, thus connecting with any road that<br />
might be constructed in Pennsylvania, with a view<br />
of continuing the line northward. Work was be-<br />
gun in the year following, and the road completed<br />
as far as the Relay Ilouse, a distance of seven<br />
miles from the city of Baltimore, on the 4th of July,<br />
1831. And on the 16th of October it was extended<br />
eleven miles further to Timonium.<br /><br />
In the same year, the branch to Owing’s Mills, a<br />
distance of nine miles, was opened. The section<br />
from Timonium to the State line, twenty-five miles,<br />
was begun#¥in May, 1835, and completed in the early<br />
part of 1838.<br /><br />
Shortly after the completion of this last section,<br />
the York and Maryland Line Railroad built a con-<br />
tinuation from the Maryland Line to York, Pa.<br /><br />
On the 10th of April, 1854, the Legislature of<br />
Maryland passed an act authorizing the consoli-<br />
dation of the Baltimore and Susquehanna and the<br />
York and Maryland Line. This consolidation hav-<br />
ing been approved by the stockholders of the several<br />
companies, was consummated on the 4th of Decem-<br />
ber following; and on the 1st of January, 1855, the<br />
new company commenced its operations.<br /><br />
The PurrapeLrura AND BALTIMORE CENTRAL RAIL-<br />
roAD. — The portion of this road in Maryland was<br />
originally known as the Baltimore and Philadelphia<br />
Railroad. The company was chartered in May,<br />
1852, and organized in October, 1853. On the 25th<br />
of June, 1854, it was consolidated into the Philadel-<br />
phia and Baltimore Central Railroad, and in June,<br />
1856, the work of construction was commenced in<br />
Cecil County; but in the fall of the same year ope-<br />
rations in Maryland were suspended.<br /><br />
In 1866, the road was completed to Rising Sun,<br />
and was finished to the junction with the Columbia<br />
and Port Deposit Railroad, on the Octoraro, near<br />
Rowlandsville, four miles above Port Deposit, in the<br />
spring of 1869.<br /><br />
The line now in use commences at the Maryland<br />
line below Nottingham Station, and extends to C. &amp;<br />
P. D. Junction, a distance of 9} miles.<br /><br />
The PHILADELPHIA, WILMINGTON AND BALTIMORE<br />
RarLroap. — This company is a consolidation of four<br />
railroad companies. The Philadelphia and Dela-<br />
ware Counties, chartered by the Legislature of Penn-<br />
sylvania on the 2d of April, 1831; the Wilmington<br />
and Susquchanna, chartered by the Legislature of<br />
Delaware on the 18th of January, 1832; the Mary-<br />
land and Delaware, chartered by the Legislature of<br />
Maryland in 1831; and the Baltimore and Port De-<br />
posit Company, chartered by the Legislature of Mary-<br />
land in December, 1831. In March, 1836, the title<br />
of the Philadelphia and Delaware Counties Railroad<br />
Company was changed to that of the Philadelphia,<br />
On the 18th of April,<br />
1836, the Wilmington and Susquehanna, and Dela-<br />
ware and Maryland Companies also consolidated,<br />
under the title of the Wilmington and Susquehanna<br />
Railroad Company; .and on the 5th of IFFebruary,<br />
1838, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore,<br />
the Wilmington and Susquehanna, and the Baltimore<br />
and Port Deposit Companies, were consolidated,<br />
under the title of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and<br />
Baltimore Railroad Company.<br /><br />
Previous to the consolidation, the several compa-<br />
nies had commenced, and most of them had com-<br />
pleted, the respective links. The Philadelphia and<br />
Delaware Counties Company had completed its road<br />
in 1837. The Baltimore and Port Deposit also<br />
opened its road to Havre de Grace, instead of Port<br />

RATILWAYS AND CANALS<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
By an act of the Legislature, approved on the 2d<br />
of February, 1836, the Company was empowered to<br />
construct a bridge across the Susquehanna (4,400<br />
feet), and extend the road through Marrisburg to<br />
the Pennsylvania Canal, about three miles beyond<br />
the then eastern terminus, and also to connect with<br />
other roads centring at Harrisburg. 7his was the<br />
original Cumberland Valley Road. That portion<br />
from Chambersburg to Hagerstown was originally<br />
known as the Franklin Railroad.<br />
<br />
This company was chartered in Pennsylvania, on<br />
the 12th of March, 1832, and in Maryland in the<br />
same year, and was authorized to construct.a road<br />
in continuation of the Cumberland Valley Railroad<br />
from Chambersburg to Hagerstown. The road was<br />
built in 1838, and after changing owners several<br />
times, finally came into the hands of the Cumber-<br />
land Valley Road, by which it is now operated.<br />
<br />
The DorcHESTER AND DELAWARE RAILROAD runs<br />
from Cambridge, Md., to Seaford, Del., a distance<br />
of thirty-three miles, 5% miles of which are in the<br />
State of Delaware, and was built by the - Philadel-<br />
phia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad Com-<br />
pany, and leased to the Dorchester and Delaware<br />
Railroad Company.<br />
<br />
The D. & D. RR. Co. owns two locomotives, and<br />
hires the other rolling-stock from the P., W., & B.<br />
RR. Co.<br />
<br />
The first work on this road was commenced Oc-<br />
tober 23, 1867, and on November 8, 1869, it was<br />
opened for passengers and freight.<br />
<br />
Seaford, the eastern terminus, is on the Delaware<br />
Railroad Line, and Cambridge, the western termi-<br />
nus, is on the south side of the Choptank River,<br />
twenty miles from its entrance into the Chesapeake<br />
Bay, and is the county-seat of Dorchester County.<br />
Steamers to and from Baltimore connect with the<br />
road at this point.<br />
<br />
The EasteEry SHORE RAILROAD was chartered by<br />
the Maryland Legislature in the year 1853, and the<br />
company organized February 22d, 1859.<br />
<br />
The road from Salisbury to Crisfield was built by<br />
George A. Parker, of Boston, Mass., under one con-<br />
tract, the work being commenced in August, 1865.<br />
In March, 1866, the road was opened for business to<br />
Princess Anne, and in October of the same year<br />
‘was opened to its terminus at Crisfield.<br />
<br />
The entire length of the road from Crisfield to<br />
Delmar, a point on the dividing-line between the<br />
States of Maryland and Delaware, is thirty-eight<br />
miles; and at this point it becomes continuous with<br />
the Delaware Railroad.<br />
<br />
The Eastern Shore Railroad hasseveral important<br />
connections, two of which are already completed,<br />
and another projected. The Wicomico and Poco-<br />
moke Railroad connects with it at Salisbury; the<br />
‘Worcester Railroad being connected by means of<br />
the Wicomico and Pocomoke. These roads traverse<br />
a rich and prosperous section of country, making<br />
them very important tributaries to the Eastern Shore<br />
Railroad ; the length of the two roads being about<br />
thirty-seven miles. '<br />
<br />
The next important branch is the one leading<br />
from near Princess Anne to Newtown, a distance<br />
of nine miles. This road, just completed, may some<br />
day be continued, extending through the Eastern<br />
Shore counties in Virginia, of Accomac and North-<br />
ampton.<br />
<br />
The Eastern Shore Railroad, with proposed ex-<br />
tensions, is, geographically, the most direct air-line<br />
route between the North and the South. The dis-<br />
tance from Crisfield to Norfolk, Va., by actual survey,<br />
is eighty-four miles, connecting at Norfolk with the<br />
Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad, and thence to<br />
Charleston, S. C., and other points South. The dis-<br />
tance between Charleston and New York can be<br />
made, over this route, about six hours quicker than<br />
by any other.<br />
<br />
The projected connections are, (1.) The railroad to<br />
extend from West Point, on the York River, Va,<br />
to Pionkatank on the Chesapeake Bay, thence by<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
steam thirty-five miles to Crisfield; (2.) The Wash-<br />
ington and Point Lookout Railroad, from Washing-<br />
ton, D. C., to the mouth of the Potomac River at<br />
Point Lookout, in St. Mary’s County, Md., which<br />
road is now partly built, and is expected soon to be<br />
finished ; thence by steamer to Crisfield, a distance<br />
of thirty miles; and (3.) The Baltimore and Drum<br />
Point Railroad, extending from that point to Balti-<br />
more, and connecting by steamer from Drum Point<br />
to Cristield, a distance of forty-five miles.<br />
<br />
The grades of the Eastern Shore Railroad are re-<br />
markably easy, and its direction nearly an air-line.<br />
At Delmar, its northern terminus, it is thirty-two fect<br />
above tide-water; at Salisbury, twenty-six; Princess<br />
Anne, fourteen; Kingston, twelve; Crisfield, its<br />
southern terminus, four —making twenty-eight feet<br />
in thirty-eight miles. The road is in a prosperous<br />
condition, and its business steadily increasing, and is<br />
surely destined to become a most important connect-<br />
ing-link between the Atlantic seaboard section of the<br />
South and the great cities of the North.<br />
<br />
The KrxT CouNTY RAILROAD Was commenced in<br />
1869, and is now completed from Massey’s Cross<br />
Roads to a point five miles beyond Chestertown,<br />
near Belle Air, a distance of twenty-five miles.<br />
<br />
There is a branch or lateral road, five-eighths of a<br />
mile long, from the depot in the precincts of Ches-<br />
tertown to Chester River. At the terminus on the<br />
river a fine substantial wharf has been erected. The<br />
direction through which the road passes is one of the<br />
finest agricultural sections in the country. It is in<br />
contemplation to extend the road from Belle Air to<br />
some point on the Chesapeake Bay, from which a<br />
steamer can run to Baltimore in 1§ hours.<br />
<br />
In 1868, the Legislature of Maryland authorized<br />
the Delaware RR. Co. to construect a road from Mas-<br />
sey’s Cross Roads to the Delaware line, and the Del-<br />
aware Legislature authorized the same company to<br />
construct a road from some point on the Delaware<br />
TRailroad to meet the proposed road from Massey’s.<br />
In 1869 they constructed this road from Townsend, on<br />
the Delaware Road to Massey’s Cross Roads in<br />
Maryland. Thisis known as the Townsend Branch,<br />
and is ten miles long.<br />
<br />
There is a railroad from Massey’s Cross Roads<br />
through Millington, in Kent, and through Queen<br />
Anne County to Centreville, about twenty miles in<br />
length, called the QuEEN ANNE AND KENT RATLROAD.<br />
This road and the Kent County Railroad lease the<br />
Townsend Branch,and thus have direct connections,<br />
through the Declaware Railroad, with all the main<br />
lines. :<br />
<br />
About 9,000 passengers travelled over the Kent<br />
County Railroad in 1871. The businessisimproving,<br />
and, if the Bay connections are made, will increase<br />
still more. A telegraph is being constructed along<br />
the line.<br />
<br />
The MARYLAND AND DELAWARE Ratnroap Co. was<br />
chartered in Maryland in the year 1854, and in the<br />
State of Delaware in 1857. This company was<br />
authorized to construct a road from Clayton, on the<br />
Delaware Railroad, to Oxford, on the Choptank, an<br />
arm of the Chesapeake Bay, a distance of fifty-four<br />
miles.<br />
<br />
The work of construction was commenced on the<br />
27th of December, 1857, and was completed, with<br />
the exception of the pier, in 1871. The road has a<br />
length of fourteen miles in Delaware and forty in<br />
Maryland.<br />
<br />
At its terminus on the Chesapeake Bay there is a<br />
fine and commodious harbor, from which a daily line<br />
of steamers runs to Baltimore; and one to Norfolk,<br />
Va., is proposed.<br />
<br />
The MEerroroLiTAN BraNcH RAILR0OAD was char-<br />
tered in the District of Columbia by Congress on<br />
the 3d of March, 1853, and by the Legislature of<br />
Maryland on the 5th of April of the same year.<br />
The line of the road extends from Washington City<br />
to a junction with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad<br />
near Point of Rocks. Work was commenced in<br />
1854, and completed in 1872.<br />

 <br />
<br />
The NorTnerN CENTRAL RATLROAD, extending from<br />
Baltimore, Md., to Sunbury, Pa., a distance of 138<br />
miles, was formed by the consolidation of several<br />
roads in Pennsylvania, and what was originally<br />
known as the Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad<br />
in Maryland.<br />
<br />
The Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad Co. was<br />
chartered on the 13th of March, 1828, with authority<br />
to construct a road from Baltimore to the north line<br />
of the State, thus connecting with any road that<br />
might be constructed in Pennsylvania, with a view<br />
of continuing the line northward. Work was be-<br />
gun in the year following, and the road completed<br />
as far as the Relay Ilouse, a distance of seven<br />
miles from the city of Baltimore, on the 4th of July,<br />
1831. And on the 16th of October it was extended<br />
eleven miles further to Timonium.<br />
<br />
In the same year, the branch to Owing’s Mills, a<br />
distance of nine miles, was opened. The section<br />
from Timonium to the State line, twenty-five miles,<br />
was begun#¥in May, 1835, and completed in the early<br />
part of 1838.<br />
<br />
Shortly after the completion of this last section,<br />
the York and Maryland Line Railroad built a con-<br />
tinuation from the Maryland Line to York, Pa.<br />
<br />
On the 10th of April, 1854, the Legislature of<br />
Maryland passed an act authorizing the consoli-<br />
dation of the Baltimore and Susquehanna and the<br />
York and Maryland Line. This consolidation hav-<br />
ing been approved by the stockholders of the several<br />
companies, was consummated on the 4th of Decem-<br />
ber following; and on the 1st of January, 1855, the<br />
new company commenced its operations.<br />
<br />
The PurrapeLrura AND BALTIMORE CENTRAL RAIL-<br />
roAD. — The portion of this road in Maryland was<br />
originally known as the Baltimore and Philadelphia<br />
Railroad. The company was chartered in May,<br />
1852, and organized in October, 1853. On the 25th<br />
of June, 1854, it was consolidated into the Philadel-<br />
phia and Baltimore Central Railroad, and in June,<br />
1856, the work of construction was commenced in<br />
Cecil County; but in the fall of the same year ope-<br />
rations in Maryland were suspended.<br />
<br />
In 1866, the road was completed to Rising Sun,<br />
and was finished to the junction with the Columbia<br />
and Port Deposit Railroad, on the Octoraro, near<br />
Rowlandsville, four miles above Port Deposit, in the<br />
spring of 1869.<br />
<br />
The line now in use commences at the Maryland<br />
line below Nottingham Station, and extends to C. &<br />
P. D. Junction, a distance of 9} miles.<br />
<br />
The PHILADELPHIA, WILMINGTON AND BALTIMORE<br />
RarLroap. — This company is a consolidation of four<br />
railroad companies. The Philadelphia and Dela-<br />
ware Counties, chartered by the Legislature of Penn-<br />
sylvania on the 2d of April, 1831; the Wilmington<br />
and Susquchanna, chartered by the Legislature of<br />
Delaware on the 18th of January, 1832; the Mary-<br />
land and Delaware, chartered by the Legislature of<br />
Maryland in 1831; and the Baltimore and Port De-<br />
posit Company, chartered by the Legislature of Mary-<br />
land in December, 1831. In March, 1836, the title<br />
of the Philadelphia and Delaware Counties Railroad<br />
Company was changed to that of the Philadelphia,<br />
On the 18th of April,<br />
1836, the Wilmington and Susquehanna, and Dela-<br />
ware and Maryland Companies also consolidated,<br />
under the title of the Wilmington and Susquehanna<br />
Railroad Company; .and on the 5th of IFFebruary,<br />
1838, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore,<br />
the Wilmington and Susquehanna, and the Baltimore<br />
and Port Deposit Companies, were consolidated,<br />
under the title of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and<br />
Baltimore Railroad Company.<br />
<br />
Previous to the consolidation, the several compa-<br />
nies had commenced, and most of them had com-<br />
pleted, the respective links. The Philadelphia and<br />
Delaware Counties Company had completed its road<br />
in 1837. The Baltimore and Port Deposit also<br />
opened its road to Havre de Grace, instead of Port<br />
Deposit. In the same year (July, 1837,) the Mary-<br />

land and Delaware Road was completed. In 1838,<br />
the viaduct over the Schuylkill was completed, and<br />
a connection was opened to Philadelphia by means<br />
of the Southwark Road.<br /><br />
The PrrrspvrcH, WASHINGTON AND DBALTIMORE<br />
Ramuroap CompaNy was chartered on the 3d of<br />
April, 1837, under the name of the Pittsburgh and<br />
Connellsville Railroad Company, with authority to<br />
construct a road from Pittsburgh by the course of<br />
the Monongahela and Youghiogheny rivers to some<br />
suitable point at or near Connellsville. The charter<br />
having lapsed, was revived by an Act passed on the<br />
18th of April, 18438, and the company authorized to<br />
extend their road beyond Connellsville to Smithfield<br />
or any other point on the waters of the Youghi-<br />
ogheny. In January, 1853, the company obtained a<br />
charter from the State of Maryland, which conferred<br />
authority for the extension of the road into that<br />
State as far as Cumberland.<br /><br />
The necessary surveys were commenced on the<br />
20th of July, 1853, and the contract for the work on<br />
the division between West Newton and Connells-<br />
ville, twenty-five miles, was given out on the 22d of<br />
March, 1854. This portion of the road was com-<br />
pleted and opened for business on the 13th of Sep-<br />
tember, 1855. On the 26th of April of the same<br />
year, that portion of the first division of the road,<br />
between West Newton and Turtle Creek, was con-<br />
tracted for, and the work immediately thereafter com-<br />
menced ; and in the spring of 1856, the contract was<br />
given out for the tunnel at Sand Patch Summit.<br /><br /><br /><br />
On the 10th of August, 1856, the road was opened<br />
from West Newton to Guffey’s Station, eight miles,<br />
and on the 14th of January, 1857, to the mouth of<br />
Turtle Creek, fifteen miles.<br /><br />
Operations at the tunnel works were suspended on<br />
the 1st of October, 1857. Early in 1859, the work of<br />
construction was commenced between Turtle Creek<br />
and Pittsburgh. The entire length of the road was<br />
completed from Pittsburgh to Cumberland in April,<br />
1870, a distance of 149-5 miles. Only about five<br />
miles of the road lies within the State of Maryland.<br /><br />
The WasniNaToN BrancH RatLroap CoMPANY was<br />
chartered by the Maryland Legislature on the 9th<br />
of March, 1833, and authorized to construct a road<br />
from a point on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to<br />
Washington. Soon after, the work of construction<br />
was commenced, and the road opened for traffic on<br />
the 20th of July, from the Relay House, on the B.<br />
&amp; O. Railroad, to Bladensburg, a distance of twenty-<br />
four miles; and on the 25th of August the remain-<br />
der, a distance of six miles, was completed, opening<br />
the road through to Washington in 1835. It was<br />
constructed under the auspices of the B. &amp; O. Rail-<br />
road Co., which owns $1,016,800 of its share capital<br />
of $1,650,000, and is also managed and operated by it.<br /><br />
The WasniNgroN CouNTY RAILROAD, extending<br />
from Weverton, on the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-<br />
road, through Washington County to Hagerstown,<br />
a distance of twenty-four miles, was opened for<br />
traffic on December 1, 1867. The road is princi-<br />
pally owned by the Baltimore and Ohio Company.<br /><br /><br /><br />
The WESTERN MARYLAND RATLROAD COMPANY Was<br />
chartered by the Maryland Legislature, January,<br />
1852, the extent of the road being from Relay, on<br />
the Northern Central Railroad, to Hagerstown, a<br />
distance of 81{%% miles. The work of construction<br />
was begun in July, 1857, and the line completed as<br />
far as Owings’ Mills, a distance of ten miles, in<br />
July, 1858. In the following September it was ex-<br />
tended to Reisterstown, a point five miles further;<br />
and in June, 1860, to Finksburg, three miles further,<br />
making an extent of eighteen miles. It was opened<br />
through to Hagerstown on June 4, 1872, and is now<br />
extending 6%7; (6-45) miles further to Williamsport,<br />
on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. An indepen-<br />
dent line is also being constructed from Baltimore to<br />
a point on the present road called Owings’ Mills, by<br />
which the use of the Northern Central Railroad will<br />
be avoided. _<br /><br />
The distance by present line from Baltimore to<br />
Hagerstown is 88:79 miles. The distance by the<br />
independent line, when completed, will be about 83<br />
miles.<br /><br />
The Wicomico AND PocoMokE RAILR0OAD extends<br />
from Salisbury on the Eastern Shore Railroad to<br />
Berlin, a distance of twenty-three miles.<br /><br />
The WorcesTER RalLroap, completed in 1872,<br />
is a continuation of the Wicomico and Pocomoke<br />
Railroad, running from Berlin in Worcester County,<br />
to Snow Hill, a distance of about fourteen miles.<br />
It is chiefly owned by the Wicomico and Pocomoke<br />
Road.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
DISERICT OF -COEUMBYA,<br /><br />
THE Act of Congress creating the District of<br />
Columbia was passed July 16th, 1790. The<br />
territory was exactly ten miles square, and was laid<br />
oft diagonally, with reference to the points of the<br />
compass; i e., its boundary lines bear north-east,<br />
north-west, etc. Its southern angle was at Jones’<br />
Point, just south of Alexandria, on the west side of<br />
the Potomac. It comprised portions of the territory<br />
of the States of Virginia and Maryland, which were<br />
ceded by them to the General Government. The<br />
portion which was derived from Virginia, lying south-<br />
west of the river, was, however, ceded back to that<br />
State in 1846, and the remaining portion, containing<br />
sixty square miles, lies entirely on the north-eastern<br />
side of the river, which forms the south-western<br />
boundary of the District, separating it from Virginia.<br /><br />
The District is situated between Lat. 30° 51’ and<br /><br />
30° north, and Lon. 76° 58 and 77° 6’ west, three<br />
hundred miles from the Ocean by the Potomac River<br />
and Chesapeake Bay.<br />
- It forms the county of Washington, and is divided<br />
for election purposes into twenty-two election dis-<br />
tricts, eighteen in the city of Washington, two in<br />
Georgetown, and two which embrace all outside of<br />
the limits of the two cities.<br /><br />
Up to a recent period the District has been entirely<br />
under the jurisdiction of, and governed by the laws<br />
of Maryland in force at the time of the cession of the<br />
territory to the United States.<br /><br />
On the 21st of February, 1871, an Act of Congress<br />
was passed, declaring that all that part of the terri-<br />
tory of the United States, included within the limits<br />
of the District of Columbia, should be created into a<br />
government, by the name of said District, and that<br />
the executive power and authority in and over the<br />
same should be vested in a Governor, who should be<br />
appointed by the President; and the legislative<br />
power be vested in a legislative assembly. Under<br />
this Act, the President appointed Henry D. Cook,<br />
Esq., Governor.<br /><br />
Metzerott Hall, on Pennsylvania Avenue, has been<br />
fitted up for the use of the territorial legislature.<br /><br />
The surface of the District is gently undulating,<br />
and the soil naturally thin, sandy, and sterile. Cli-<br />
mate is moist and warm, summer and autumn fevers<br /><br />
T<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
prevailing on the low grounds near the Potomac. Con-<br />
siderable quantities of flour and other domestic pro-<br />
duce are brought down the Potomac, but neither the<br />
commerce nor shipping of the District are important.<br /><br />
There are two Colleges in the District: Georgetown<br />
College (connected with which is a flourishing girls’<br />
seminary) was founded in 1789, and is under the<br />
direction of the Jesuits; and Columbia College,<br />
founded in 1821, under the auspices of the Baptist<br />
General Convention.<br /><br />

(a) Then in the District of Columbia, now in Virginia.<br /><br />
The city of WasniNeToN, capital of the United<br /><br />
States of America, occupies a nearly central position<br />
in the District, on the left bank of the Potomac, one<br />
hundred and sixty miles from its mouth. Latitude<br />
(Capitol building) 38° 52’ 20”, Longitude 77° 0’ 15""<br />
west from Greenwich. The natural situation of<br />
‘Washington is pleasant, and it is laid out on a plan<br />
which will render it, when the extensive system of<br />
grading and sewerage now under way shall be com-<br />
pleted, one of the most elegant and commodious<br />
cities in the world.<br /><br />
The principal public buildings are: the Capitol,<br />
the President’s House, the Departments of the<br /><br /><br /><br />
Treasury, Navy, Patent Office, Post Office, National<br />
Observatory, Arsenal, Navy Yard, Smithsonian In-<br />
stitute, Washington Monument, and City Hall.<br /><br />
The Capitol, situated in a commanding position,<br />
surrounded by a park of 85 acres, was begun in<br />
17983, burnt by the British in 1814, rebuilt and com-<br />
pleted in 1825, and subsequently enlarged. The<br />
centre is 352 by 101 feet, with a lofty dome, the wings<br />
142 by 238 feet; the entire building being 751 feet<br />
long, by 324 feet deep, covering 3% acres,—the centre<br />
of white sandstone, the wings of white marble.<br /><br />
The Congressional Library contains 70,000 vol-<br />

The President’s mansion, usually called the White<br />
House, is in the west part of the city, is built of free-<br />
stone, and is 170 feet long and 86 deep.<br /><br />
An aqueduct, which cost $3,000,000, supplies the<br />
city with water from the Potomac, at Great Falls,<br />
nineteen miles above the city, discharging nearly<br />
three times as much water as the Croton aqueduct<br />
of New York.<br /><br />
Washington was founded in 1790 by the first Presi-<br />
dent of the United States, whose name it bears. It<br />
became the seat of the Federal Government in 1800.<br /><br />
The city of GrorGETowN joins Washington on the<br />
west. It is situated on elevated ground, dotted with<br />
handsome villas, and commands a superb view of<br />
the surrounding country. It is at the head of navi-<br />
gation of the Potomac River.<br /><br />

land and Delaware Road was completed. In 1838,<br />
the viaduct over the Schuylkill was completed, and<br />
a connection was opened to Philadelphia by means<br />
of the Southwark Road.<br />
<br />
The PrrrspvrcH, WASHINGTON AND DBALTIMORE<br />
Ramuroap CompaNy was chartered on the 3d of<br />
April, 1837, under the name of the Pittsburgh and<br />
Connellsville Railroad Company, with authority to<br />
construct a road from Pittsburgh by the course of<br />
the Monongahela and Youghiogheny rivers to some<br />
suitable point at or near Connellsville. The charter<br />
having lapsed, was revived by an Act passed on the<br />
18th of April, 18438, and the company authorized to<br />
extend their road beyond Connellsville to Smithfield<br />
or any other point on the waters of the Youghi-<br />
ogheny. In January, 1853, the company obtained a<br />
charter from the State of Maryland, which conferred<br />
authority for the extension of the road into that<br />
State as far as Cumberland.<br />
<br />
The necessary surveys were commenced on the<br />
20th of July, 1853, and the contract for the work on<br />
the division between West Newton and Connells-<br />
ville, twenty-five miles, was given out on the 22d of<br />
March, 1854. This portion of the road was com-<br />
pleted and opened for business on the 13th of Sep-<br />
tember, 1855. On the 26th of April of the same<br />
year, that portion of the first division of the road,<br />
between West Newton and Turtle Creek, was con-<br />
tracted for, and the work immediately thereafter com-<br />
menced ; and in the spring of 1856, the contract was<br />
given out for the tunnel at Sand Patch Summit.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
On the 10th of August, 1856, the road was opened<br />
from West Newton to Guffey’s Station, eight miles,<br />
and on the 14th of January, 1857, to the mouth of<br />
Turtle Creek, fifteen miles.<br />
<br />
Operations at the tunnel works were suspended on<br />
the 1st of October, 1857. Early in 1859, the work of<br />
construction was commenced between Turtle Creek<br />
and Pittsburgh. The entire length of the road was<br />
completed from Pittsburgh to Cumberland in April,<br />
1870, a distance of 149-5 miles. Only about five<br />
miles of the road lies within the State of Maryland.<br />
<br />
The WasniNaToN BrancH RatLroap CoMPANY was<br />
chartered by the Maryland Legislature on the 9th<br />
of March, 1833, and authorized to construct a road<br />
from a point on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to<br />
Washington. Soon after, the work of construction<br />
was commenced, and the road opened for traffic on<br />
the 20th of July, from the Relay House, on the B.<br />
& O. Railroad, to Bladensburg, a distance of twenty-<br />
four miles; and on the 25th of August the remain-<br />
der, a distance of six miles, was completed, opening<br />
the road through to Washington in 1835. It was<br />
constructed under the auspices of the B. & O. Rail-<br />
road Co., which owns $1,016,800 of its share capital<br />
of $1,650,000, and is also managed and operated by it.<br />
<br />
The WasniNgroN CouNTY RAILROAD, extending<br />
from Weverton, on the Baltimore and Ohio Rail-<br />
road, through Washington County to Hagerstown,<br />
a distance of twenty-four miles, was opened for<br />
traffic on December 1, 1867. The road is princi-<br />
pally owned by the Baltimore and Ohio Company.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The WESTERN MARYLAND RATLROAD COMPANY Was<br />
chartered by the Maryland Legislature, January,<br />
1852, the extent of the road being from Relay, on<br />
the Northern Central Railroad, to Hagerstown, a<br />
distance of 81{%% miles. The work of construction<br />
was begun in July, 1857, and the line completed as<br />
far as Owings’ Mills, a distance of ten miles, in<br />
July, 1858. In the following September it was ex-<br />
tended to Reisterstown, a point five miles further;<br />
and in June, 1860, to Finksburg, three miles further,<br />
making an extent of eighteen miles. It was opened<br />
through to Hagerstown on June 4, 1872, and is now<br />
extending 6%7; (6-45) miles further to Williamsport,<br />
on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. An indepen-<br />
dent line is also being constructed from Baltimore to<br />
a point on the present road called Owings’ Mills, by<br />
which the use of the Northern Central Railroad will<br />
be avoided. _<br />
<br />
The distance by present line from Baltimore to<br />
Hagerstown is 88:79 miles. The distance by the<br />
independent line, when completed, will be about 83<br />
miles.<br />
<br />
The Wicomico AND PocoMokE RAILR0OAD extends<br />
from Salisbury on the Eastern Shore Railroad to<br />
Berlin, a distance of twenty-three miles.<br />
<br />
The WorcesTER RalLroap, completed in 1872,<br />
is a continuation of the Wicomico and Pocomoke<br />
Railroad, running from Berlin in Worcester County,<br />
to Snow Hill, a distance of about fourteen miles.<br />
It is chiefly owned by the Wicomico and Pocomoke<br />

DISERICT OF -COEUMBYA,<br />
<br />
THE Act of Congress creating the District of<br />
Columbia was passed July 16th, 1790. The<br />
territory was exactly ten miles square, and was laid<br />
oft diagonally, with reference to the points of the<br />
compass; i e., its boundary lines bear north-east,<br />
north-west, etc. Its southern angle was at Jones’<br />
Point, just south of Alexandria, on the west side of<br />
the Potomac. It comprised portions of the territory<br />
of the States of Virginia and Maryland, which were<br />
ceded by them to the General Government. The<br />
portion which was derived from Virginia, lying south-<br />
west of the river, was, however, ceded back to that<br />
State in 1846, and the remaining portion, containing<br />
sixty square miles, lies entirely on the north-eastern<br />
side of the river, which forms the south-western<br />
boundary of the District, separating it from Virginia.<br />
<br />
The District is situated between Lat. 30° 51’ and<br />
<br />
30° north, and Lon. 76° 58 and 77° 6’ west, three<br />
hundred miles from the Ocean by the Potomac River<br />
and Chesapeake Bay.<br />
- It forms the county of Washington, and is divided<br />
for election purposes into twenty-two election dis-<br />
tricts, eighteen in the city of Washington, two in<br />
Georgetown, and two which embrace all outside of<br />
the limits of the two cities.<br />
<br />
Up to a recent period the District has been entirely<br />
under the jurisdiction of, and governed by the laws<br />
of Maryland in force at the time of the cession of the<br />
territory to the United States.<br />
<br />
On the 21st of February, 1871, an Act of Congress<br />
was passed, declaring that all that part of the terri-<br />
tory of the United States, included within the limits<br />
of the District of Columbia, should be created into a<br />
government, by the name of said District, and that<br />
the executive power and authority in and over the<br />
same should be vested in a Governor, who should be<br />
appointed by the President; and the legislative<br />
power be vested in a legislative assembly. Under<br />
this Act, the President appointed Henry D. Cook,<br />
Esq., Governor.<br />
<br />
Metzerott Hall, on Pennsylvania Avenue, has been<br />
fitted up for the use of the territorial legislature.<br />
<br />
The surface of the District is gently undulating,<br />
and the soil naturally thin, sandy, and sterile. Cli-<br />
mate is moist and warm, summer and autumn fevers<br />
<br />
T<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
prevailing on the low grounds near the Potomac. Con-<br />
siderable quantities of flour and other domestic pro-<br />
duce are brought down the Potomac, but neither the<br />
commerce nor shipping of the District are important.<br />
<br />
There are two Colleges in the District: Georgetown<br />
College (connected with which is a flourishing girls’<br />
seminary) was founded in 1789, and is under the<br />
direction of the Jesuits; and Columbia College,<br />
founded in 1821, under the auspices of the Baptist<br />
General Convention.<br />

(a) Then in the District of Columbia, now in Virginia.<br />
<br />
The city of WasniNeToN, capital of the United<br />
<br />
States of America, occupies a nearly central position<br />
in the District, on the left bank of the Potomac, one<br />
hundred and sixty miles from its mouth. Latitude<br />
(Capitol building) 38° 52’ 20”, Longitude 77° 0’ 15""<br />
west from Greenwich. The natural situation of<br />
‘Washington is pleasant, and it is laid out on a plan<br />
which will render it, when the extensive system of<br />
grading and sewerage now under way shall be com-<br />
pleted, one of the most elegant and commodious<br />
cities in the world.<br />
<br />
The principal public buildings are: the Capitol,<br />
the President’s House, the Departments of the<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Treasury, Navy, Patent Office, Post Office, National<br />
Observatory, Arsenal, Navy Yard, Smithsonian In-<br />
stitute, Washington Monument, and City Hall.<br />
<br />
The Capitol, situated in a commanding position,<br />
surrounded by a park of 85 acres, was begun in<br />
17983, burnt by the British in 1814, rebuilt and com-<br />
pleted in 1825, and subsequently enlarged. The<br />
centre is 352 by 101 feet, with a lofty dome, the wings<br />
142 by 238 feet; the entire building being 751 feet<br />
long, by 324 feet deep, covering 3% acres,—the centre<br />
of white sandstone, the wings of white marble.<br />
<br />
The Congressional Library contains 70,000 vol-<br />
umes, besides 80,000 volumes of Documents.<br />
<br />
The President’s mansion, usually called the White<br />
House, is in the west part of the city, is built of free-<br />
stone, and is 170 feet long and 86 deep.<br />
<br />
An aqueduct, which cost $3,000,000, supplies the<br />
city with water from the Potomac, at Great Falls,<br />
nineteen miles above the city, discharging nearly<br />
three times as much water as the Croton aqueduct<br />
of New York.<br />
<br />
Washington was founded in 1790 by the first Presi-<br />
dent of the United States, whose name it bears. It<br />
became the seat of the Federal Government in 1800.<br />
<br />
The city of GrorGETowN joins Washington on the<br />
