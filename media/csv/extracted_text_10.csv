I. INTRODUCTION<br /><br />
In October, 1958, Mayor D’Alesandro requested the Planning Com-<br />
mission to review its plans for the East-West Expressway to determine<br />
if a less controversial route could be developed. In making this request<br />
he indicated that particular attention should be given to the effect of the<br />
Expressway upon existing residential neighborhoods.<br /><br />
While work on this request was still under way, Mayor D’Alesandro<br />
was succeeded by Mayor Grady. The Planning Commission felt, however,<br />
that the study should be completed and published, and Mayor Grady<br />
concurred in this conclusion. This report, therefore, presents the results<br />
of the studies which have been made by the Department of Planning and<br />
which are endorsed by the Planning Commission.<br /><br />
This report not only analyzes possible routes for an East-West Ex-<br />
pressway, but also presents the reasons why the Planning Commission<br />
believes it should be built. Chapter IV presents the need in terms of<br />
future traffic demands and Chapter V states the general reasons for han-<br />
dling this demand, at least in large part, by an expressway rather than<br />
through other types of streets or highways. In the final analysis, however,<br />
judgment must be based upon a weighing of the advantages to be derived<br />
from a specific route as against the cost of the same route in terms of<br />
money, property demolition, effect on taxes, and possible detrimental<br />
effect on adjacent areas. The final justification for an East-West Express-<br />
way is therefore not presented until Chapter X following discussion of<br />
possible routes.<br /><br />
The plans accompanying this report have been worked out in con-<br />
siderable detail to demonstrate feasibility and to explore possibilities, but<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
it should be kept in mind that these are not working drawings. If the<br />
recommendations in this report are adopted the final plans may deviate<br />
in many details from those shown herein.<br /><br />
One point needs to be made concerning nomenclature. By agreement<br />
among highway experts the term expressway is used to denote a highway<br />
with some degree of control (not necessarily complete) over access from<br />
abutting properties and some degree of separation (not necessarily com-<br />
plete) at traffic crossings. The term freeway is used for expressways<br />
having complete control over access and complete separation from other<br />
streets and highways. The Jones Falls Expressway and the proposed<br />
East-West Expressway are technically freeways and to be correct we<br />
should refer to them as the “Jones Falls Freeway” and the “East-West<br />
Freeway.” However, the term expressway (meaning freeway) is deeply<br />
embedded in Baltimore usage (as well as in certain pieces of State and<br />
City legislation) and, while an effort probably should be made at some<br />
point to bring about a correction in terms, it did not seem appropriate<br />
to do so in this report. Therefore, the material which follows continues<br />
to refer to expressways as meaning highways having complete access con-<br />
trol and complete separation from other streets and highways.<br /><br />
An effort has been made to prepare this report without extensive use<br />
of technical terms. Nevertheless, definitions of a few terms used herein<br />
may be helpful:<br /><br />

could proceed in a straight line from origin to destination. (Indi-<br />

SUMMARY<br /><br />
Anticipated traffic increases constitute one of the principal justifi-<br />
cations for construction of an East-West Expressway through the<br />
City. Present estimates indicate that east-west traffic will increase<br />
by approximately 509 by 1980. Since existing east-west streets are<br />
now operating at about capacity all of the anticipated increase should<br />
be handled by new routes or by widenings of existing streets.<br /><br />
An East-West Expressway eight lanes wide would take care of 40%<br />
to 509% of expected traffic increases over the next twenty years.<br />
Together with other needed improvements the East-West Expressway<br />
should absorb the increase in east-west traffic anticipated by 1980<br />
and in addition provide some measure of relief to present traffic con-<br />
gestion. This relief would be most pronounced during non-rush hours.<br /><br />
The need for an East-West Expressway is based upon local traffic and<br />
not through traffic. East-West Expressway traffic having neither<br />
origin nor destination within the metropolitan area is estimated to be<br />
no more than 69 of total traffic on the expressway.<br /><br />
While an improved public transportation system is urgently needed,<br />
the best feasible system would not noticeably affect the need for an<br />
East-West Expressway.<br /><br />
The need for a major cross-town expressway has long been recog-<br />
nized. Eight major proposals for such an expressway have been made<br />
between 1942 and 1957. All of these proposals are based upon an<br />
alignment crossing the center of the City just north of the central<br />
business district. The last of these eight proposals was included as<br />
part of the Planning Commission’s 1957 expressway plan. It is<br />
referred to in this report as the Northern Route to distinguish it<br />
from other proposed East-West Expressway alignments.<br /><br />
Since the first expressway proposal in 1942, all plans and studies for<br /><br /><br /><br />
handling anticipated traffic increases have placed major reliance upon<br />
a highway system involving one or more expressways having complete<br />
access control and complete grade separation from conflicting traffic.<br />
Expressways have distinct advantages over other types of highways.<br />
They are safer and they save travel time. They are inherently free<br />
from encroachment from abutting properties and their capacity thus<br /><br />
endures. Expressways can serve to reduce blight and to facilitate<br />
urban renewal through removing traffic (including truck traffic) from -<br /><br />
residential streets. (Other advantages and characteristics of express-<br />
ways are di{scqssed in the body of the report.)<br /><br />
. While expressways have distinct advantages over other types of high-<br /><br />
ways they also have drawbacks and if improperly located or designed<br />
they can act as a blighting influence on adjacent properties.<br /><br />
The additional traffic capacity which would result from construction<br />
of an East-West Expressway could theoretically also be provided<br />
through widening of existing streets. To do so, however, would<br />
require the removal of approximately two and one-half times as many<br />
buildings as would be razed by the East-West Expressway. The<br />
number of families to be relocated, the loss in taxes, and the cost of<br />
site acquisition would be in proportion. Total cost to the City would<br />
be substantially greater.<br /><br />
. The health of the central business district is based primarily upon its<br /><br />
relative accessibility to all parts of the metropolitan area. This<br />
relative accessibility is enhanced by an expressway system focused on<br />
the central business district; it is diminished by the construction of<br />
expressways not located so as to serve the central business district.<br />
In these terms it will take at least four radial expressways leading<br />
outwards from the center of the City to restore to the central busi-<br />
ness district the loss in relative accessibility which will result from<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","o -<br />

Failure to prepare and carry out adequate plans for the handling of<br />
future traffic increases would have pronounced effects upon the struc-<br />
ture and character of the City. It seems probable that such a failure<br />
would result in increased congestion, reduced mobility, less freedom<br />
to select jobs or home sites, a speed-up in decentralization, a greater<br />
dispersion of many functions throughout the metropolitan area, a<br />
lower level of cultural activities and of specialized services and busi-<br />
nesses, and a reduced rate of economic growth.<br /><br />
Any route for an East-West Expressway should satisfy the following<br /><br />
minimum requirements:<br /><br />
a. It should be planned in such a way that it will be approvable for<br />
inclusion in the National Interstate Highway System and thus be<br />
eligible for 909 Federal grant.<br /><br />
b. A feasible interchange with the Jones Falls Expressway must be<br />
possible.<br /><br />
c. It should provide good service to the central business district.<br /><br />
In judging between routes meeting the above requirements the fol-<br />
lowing criteria are important: benefits to traffic, to the central<br />
business district, and to the City’s economy; stimulus to new building<br />

of dwellings to be demolished; effect on assessed valuations; total<br />

This route is referred to as the Harbor Route. It is shown in its<br />
entirety on Sheet 7 and in detail on Sheets 8 through 12 and 23<br />
through 28. From the western City line to Myrtle Avenue the Harbor<br />
Route is identical to the Northern Route. After crossing Myrtle<br />
Avenue the Harbor Route turns due south to Pratt Street, then turns<br />
east between Pratt and Camden Streets, crosses the Municipal Piers<br />
just south of Pratt Street, crosses under the Jones Falls Expressway<br />
at about Pier 6, then follows approximately along the north side of<br />
the Harbor to Boston Street. It continues on Boston Street until it<br />
joins the Harbor Tunnel entrance road. It is proposed that the<br />
Harbor Tunnel entrance road be widened to the point where it merges<br />
with the proposed new Northeastern Expressway.<br /><br />
A desirable feature of many past expressway plans has been an inner<br />
ring around the central business district. This inner ring could also<br />
be provided using the Harbor Route by means of an expressway<br />
connection running from the Harbor Route at about Myrtle Avenue<br />
northeasterly to the Jones Falls Expressway.<br /><br />
Transfer of the East-West Expressway from the Northern Route to<br />
the Harbor Route would permit a partial expressway connection<br />
between the Jones Falls Expressway at about Eager Street and the<br />
northeastern section of the City.<br /><br />
A comparison of the Harbor Route with the Northern Route in<br />
terms of the criteria set forth in Item 12 above indicates that the<br />
Harbor Route is superior with respect to the following items:<br /><br />
a. Conformity to desire lines<br /><br />
b. Relief for present congestion<br /><br />
c. Opportunities for related traffic improvements<br /><br />

Historical Background<br /><br /><br /><br />
pleted, and, in a somewhat different form, the northern bypass is now<br />
under construction as the County Beltway.) But the Advisory Engineers<br />
also agreed that these bypasses would not eliminate the need for a major<br />
new cross-town facility close to the center of the City.<br /><br />
Two main routes, each with variations, were studied. (These are<br />
shown on Sheet 1.) One ran along Pratt Street, the other in a tunnel<br />
under Franklin Street. After carefully reviewing the advantages and<br />
disadvantages of each route the Advisory Engineers decided that the<br />
Franklin Street route was preferable, primarily because it came closer to<br />
certain important downtown functions, such as the retail trade center,<br />
and also because the tunnel would eliminate the time-consuming step of<br />
property acquisition near the center of the City and thus allow the project<br />
to be completed earlier. i<br /><br />
The entire route finally recommended by the Advisory Engineers<br />
comes into the City from the east at Pulaski Highway, follows along<br />
Orleans Street, uses the present Orleans Street Viaduct, tunnels under<br />
Franklin Street as far as Paca Street, continues as a depressed expressway<br />
between Mulberry and Franklin Street to the Pennsylvania Railroad a<br />
few blocks west of Monroe Street, follows generally the line of the Rail-<br />
road to the southwest, and terminates at Wilkens Avenue. It generally<br />
approximates Route A as shown on Sheet 2.<br /><br />
Route A<br /><br />
In early 1943 the Master Plan Committee of the Planning Commis-<br />
sion prepared two alternative proposals for controlled access highways<br />
across the City. These were known as Route A and Route B. Route A<br />
was virtually identical to the Advisory Engineers’ proposal except for<br />
these differences:<br /><br />
a) It was felt that a tunnel under Franklin Street could not accom-<br /><br /><br /><br />
modate an adequate number of lanes, and a depressed route along<br />
Centre Street one block to the north was substituted.<br /><br />
b) In lieu of using the Orleans Street Viaduct a new viaduct a short<br />
distance to the north was proposed.<br /><br />
¢) The route ran to the southwestern city line instead of terminating<br />
at Wilkens Avenue.<br /><br />
Route A is shown on Sheet 2.<br /><br />
Route B<br /><br />
This proposal was developed by the Master Plan Committee con-<br />
currently with Route A. It is also shown on Sheet 2.<br /><br />
Routes A and B cross in the block bounded by Mulberry Street,<br />
Franklin Street, Pine Street and Myrtle Avenue. (The main cross-town<br />
routes in all eight plans pass through this block.) To the east of this<br />
block Route B is somewhat to the north of Route A; to the west Route B<br />

line of Fremont Avenue and Scott Street as far as the B&amp;O Railroad, and<br />

Historical Background<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
pleted, and, in a somewhat different form, the northern bypass is now<br />
under construction as the County Beltway.) But the Advisory Engineers<br />
also agreed that these bypasses would not eliminate the need for a major<br />
new cross-town facility close to the center of the City.<br />
<br />
Two main routes, each with variations, were studied. (These are<br />
shown on Sheet 1.) One ran along Pratt Street, the other in a tunnel<br />
under Franklin Street. After carefully reviewing the advantages and<br />
disadvantages of each route the Advisory Engineers decided that the<br />
Franklin Street route was preferable, primarily because it came closer to<br />
certain important downtown functions, such as the retail trade center,<br />
and also because the tunnel would eliminate the time-consuming step of<br />
property acquisition near the center of the City and thus allow the project<br />
to be completed earlier. i<br />
<br />
The entire route finally recommended by the Advisory Engineers<br />
comes into the City from the east at Pulaski Highway, follows along<br />
Orleans Street, uses the present Orleans Street Viaduct, tunnels under<br />
Franklin Street as far as Paca Street, continues as a depressed expressway<br />
between Mulberry and Franklin Street to the Pennsylvania Railroad a<br />
few blocks west of Monroe Street, follows generally the line of the Rail-<br />
road to the southwest, and terminates at Wilkens Avenue. It generally<br />
approximates Route A as shown on Sheet 2.<br />
<br />
Route A<br />
<br />
In early 1943 the Master Plan Committee of the Planning Commis-<br />
sion prepared two alternative proposals for controlled access highways<br />
across the City. These were known as Route A and Route B. Route A<br />
was virtually identical to the Advisory Engineers’ proposal except for<br />
these differences:<br />
<br />
a) It was felt that a tunnel under Franklin Street could not accom-<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
modate an adequate number of lanes, and a depressed route along<br />
Centre Street one block to the north was substituted.<br />
<br />
b) In lieu of using the Orleans Street Viaduct a new viaduct a short<br />
distance to the north was proposed.<br />
<br />
¢) The route ran to the southwestern city line instead of terminating<br />
at Wilkens Avenue.<br />
<br />
Route A is shown on Sheet 2.<br />
<br />
Route B<br />
<br />
This proposal was developed by the Master Plan Committee con-<br />
currently with Route A. It is also shown on Sheet 2.<br />
<br />
Routes A and B cross in the block bounded by Mulberry Street,<br />
Franklin Street, Pine Street and Myrtle Avenue. (The main cross-town<br />
routes in all eight plans pass through this block.) To the east of this<br />
block Route B is somewhat to the north of Route A; to the west Route B<br />
is considerably to the south.<br />
<br />
From the east, Route B enters the City above Pulaski Highway,<br />
crosses the north side of Armistead Gardens, runs along Federal Street<br />
and then along Hoffman Street, crosses the Fallsway just north of Biddle<br />
Street, generally follows Biddle Street through the center of town to the<br />
Mulberry-Franklin-Pine-Myrtle block, drops almost due south along the<br />
line of Fremont Avenue and Scott Street as far as the B&O Railroad, and<br />
then follows the B&O Railroad to the southwestern City line.<br />
<br />
On March 30, 1944, the Planning Commission, after considering both<br />
Route A and Route B, officially approved Route A and recommended to<br />
the Mayor that the City take the necessary steps to construct this<br />
expressway.<br />

Historical Background<br /><br /><br /><br />
Moses Plan<br /><br />
In response to the Planning Commission’s recommendation of Route<br />
A, the Mayor appointed a special traffic committee, headed by Mr. E.<br />
Asbury Davis, to study the matter. This in turn led to the employment<br />
by the City of Mr. Robert Moses and a group of special consultants<br />
associated with Mr. Moses in his various New York activities. The Moses<br />
group prepared a report, dated October, 1944, recommending the con-<br />
struction of an expressway through the center of the City. The Moses<br />
Plan is simple to describe. It was virtually identical to Route A.<br /><br />
Smith Plan<br /><br />
The background of the Smith Plan is somewhat involved. In January<br />
of 1943 Mayor Jackson, anticipating the need for large expenditures for<br />
highways in the post-war period, initiated action to secure approval of a<br />
bond issue for this purpose. As a result the General Assembly, early in<br />
1944, authorized the issuance of a $20,000,000 bond issue for major<br />
highway purposes. The specific projects to be covered were not spelled<br />
out but it was generally held that a cross-town expressway would be the<br />
most important project involved. Ten Million Dollars of this authoriza-<br />
tion was placed on the ballot in the fall of 1944 and approved by the<br />
voters. More or less concurrently the Federal Highway Act of 1944 was<br />
adopted. This Act made Federal funds available on a matching basis<br />
which could have been used for the cross-town expressway. A request by<br />
the City to the State to appropriate the necessary matching funds was<br />
rejected by the General Assembly early in 1945. It would appear that the<br />
publicity attending the issuance of the Moses Report in October of 1944<br />
crystallized objections to this route on the part of affected property<br />
owners and that this opposition was reflected in the General Assembly’s<br />
disapproval. It was also believed, however, that the absence of an<br />
accepted comprehensive plan for major highways within the City was a<br />
factor in .the General Assembly’s disapproval and accordingly Mayor<br /><br />
McKeldin requested Mr. Nathan L. Smith, then the City’s Chief Engi-<br />
neer, to prepare a complete report on this subject.<br /><br />
Mr. Smith’s report, released in May, 1945, has historic interest pri-<br />
marily because it represents the first effort to develop an expressway<br />
pattern for the City. (See Sheet 3). It is also the first plan based upon<br />
an inner ring around the central business district. The east side of this<br />
inner ring consists of an elevated expressway along the Fallsway which,<br />
north of the Pennsylvania Railroad, runs along Barclay Street and then<br />
turns towards the northeast along Loch Raven Road. This proposal was<br />
adapted from a recommendation of the Advisory Engineers.<br /><br />
The main cross-town route in the Smith Plan substantially follows<br />
Route B from the eastern City line to the Fallsway, jogs south on the<br />
elevated structure, runs west along Route A to the Mulberry-Franklin-<br />
Pine-Myrtle block (thus forming the northern segment of the inner<br />
ring), continues due south to Pratt Street (forming the western side of<br />
the inner ring), and continues generally southerly along Russell Street.<br />
The route was designed to tie in with the new Washington-Baltimore<br />
Expressway, then in a planning stage.<br /><br />
The south side of the inner ring consists of an elevated expressway<br />
along Pratt Street.<br /><br />
A year after the Smith report the City Council authorized the ex-<br />
penditure of $350,000 for preliminary plans for an expressway through<br />
the City following the Smith route. Despite this approval, several subse-<br />
quent attempts to obtain authorization for the preparation of final plans<br />
for the first sections of this route in the southwest part of the City (so as<br />
to receive the new Washington-Baltimore Expressway) were rejected by<br />
the Council. It was not until the City administration in 1949 gave assur-<br />
ances that it would make no further attempt to push the entire Smith<br />
route that the Council relented and granted the approval that led to the<br /><br />

Transportation Study Plan<br /><br />
A comprehensive analysis of existing traffic conditions in the Balti-<br />
more metropolitan area was initiated in 1945 by the State Roads Com-<br />
mission in cooperation with the City of Baltimore and the U. S. Public<br />
Roads Administration. This study, officially identified as the Transpor-<br />
tation Study—Baltimore Metropolitan Area, included the most extensive<br />
origin and destination analysis thus far undertaken in the Baltimore area.<br />
William F. Childs, Jr., then Director of the Traffic Division, State Roads<br />
Commission, served as Director of the Study, and the report issued in<br />
October, 1946, is sometimes referred to as the Childs Report.<br /><br />
The Transportation Study Report presented three possible routes for<br />
a cross-town freeway and then analyzed each of these routes from the<br />
standpoint of their ability to serve traffic needs. All three routes coincide<br />
from the southwest City boundary to St. Paul Street and for this stretch<br />
roughly approximate the main cross-town route included in the Smith<br />
Plan. From St. Paul Street to the eastern City boundary the northerly<br />
route also approximates the Smith Plan; the middle route approximates<br />
Route A as previously described; and the southern route, referred to in<br />
the Transportation Study Report as Route C, is a wholly new alignment<br />
running between Bank and Gough Streets. All three routes are shown<br />
on Sheet 4.<br /><br />
The report concludes that “Route C on the basis of the data obtained<br />
and presented serves the needs of the study area as expressed by the<br />
desires of the motorists better than [the other two routes].” Despite this<br />
conclusion it appears that no further consideration was ever given to<br />
Route C.<br /><br />
1949 Plan<br /><br />
In 1949 the Planning Commission published A Tentative Master<br />
Transportation Plan, outlining proposals for a complete system of express-<br />
ways within the City including a cross-town expressway. (See Sheet 5).<br />
The western and central legs of the cross-town expressway are identical<br />
to the Smith proposals. The east leg crosses the Fallsway at the same<br />
point as Route A but then follows a wholly new route approximating<br />
Eager Street. This leg joins the Pulaski Highway at about Erdman Ave-<br />
nue. It will be seen that this eastern leg lies midway between Route A<br />
and Route B.<br /><br />
The 1949 Plan is based upon an inner ring similar to that proposed<br />
by Smith. The eastern side of this inner ring is again an elevated struc-<br />
ture over the Fallsway, but instead of continuing north along Barclay<br />
Street to serve the northeast it swings around to the northwest and runs<br />
up the Jones Falls Valley. This route has, of course, become the Jones<br />
Falls Expressway.<br /><br />
While the 1949 Plan assumes that the main cross-town traffic flow<br />
would come in from the southwest via the Russell Street route, it adds a<br />
depressed expressway running from the inner ring due west between Mul-<br />
berry and Franklin Streets to the Pennsylvania Railroad at which point<br />
it merges with Edmondson Avenue. This proposal is referred to in the<br />
Plan as the West Radial. It will be seen that it is identical to a portion<br />
of the main cross-town route proposed by the Advisory Engineers and also<br />
included as part of Route A and of the Moses Plan.<br /><br />
1957 Plan<br /><br />
After 1949 a number of developments occurred affecting expressway<br />
plans, and corresponding revisions were worked out by the Planning Com-<br />
mission and embodied at various times in the Master Plan. The last such<br />
change was made on December 18, 1957, and the expressway pattern as<br />","Historical Background<br />

it then stood is shown on Sheet 6 and is referred to herein as the 1957<br />
Plan. This plan is the end product of an extended evolutionary process<br />
rather than the result of a single effort to overhaul the 1949 pattern.<br /><br />
The principal developments since 1949 and the resulting changes are<br />
briefly these:<br /><br />
1. The Jones Falls Expressway, proposed in the 1949 Plan, found<br />
immediate favor and a $10,000,000 bond issue to start this ex-<br />
pressway was approved by the voters in 1951. As detailed plans<br />
were developed it became evident that the only feasible location<br />
for an interchange between the Jones Falls Expressway and the<br />
cross-town expressway was at Chase Street several blocks north<br />
of the interchange proposed in the 1949 Plan. As a result a<br />
revised route for the cross-town expressway had to be worked out<br />
all the way from the Mulberry-Franklin-Pine-Myrtle block to<br />
the eastern City line. The new route, approved by the Commis-<br />
sion in 1953, bears a very rough resemblance to the original Route<br />
B. It is referred to in subsequent chapters of this report as the<br />
Northern Route and is shown in detail on Sheets 13 through 19.<br />

it then stood is shown on Sheet 6 and is referred to herein as the 1957<br />
Plan. This plan is the end product of an extended evolutionary process<br />
rather than the result of a single effort to overhaul the 1949 pattern.<br />
<br />
The principal developments since 1949 and the resulting changes are<br />
briefly these:<br />
<br />
1. The Jones Falls Expressway, proposed in the 1949 Plan, found<br />
immediate favor and a $10,000,000 bond issue to start this ex-<br />
pressway was approved by the voters in 1951. As detailed plans<br />
were developed it became evident that the only feasible location<br />
for an interchange between the Jones Falls Expressway and the<br />
cross-town expressway was at Chase Street several blocks north<br />
of the interchange proposed in the 1949 Plan. As a result a<br />
revised route for the cross-town expressway had to be worked out<br />
all the way from the Mulberry-Franklin-Pine-Myrtle block to<br />
the eastern City line. The new route, approved by the Commis-<br />
sion in 1953, bears a very rough resemblance to the original Route<br />
B. It is referred to in subsequent chapters of this report as the<br />
Northern Route and is shown in detail on Sheets 13 through 19.<br />
(The interchange with the Jones Falls Expressway shown on<br />
Sheet 14 was worked out in the summer of 1957. While never<br />
officially approved by the Commission it was generally regarded<br />
as superior to the 1953 version.)<br />

through the City, and an east-west route through the City. The<br />
two City routes meet near the center of the City.<br /><br />
. Prior to passage of the Interstate Highway Act the proposed<br /><br />
expressway system could have been carried out only over a very<br />
long period of years. With the 909 Federal financing provided<br />
by the Act it suddenly became possible to visualize the construc-<br />
tion of the main elements of a system within the foreseeable<br />
future. This required, however, that the system be revamped to<br />
conform to the approved Federal pattern. Two principal changes<br />
were made in the 1949 Plan to bring about this conformity.<br /><br />
a) The West Radial in the 1949 Plan was extended to the western<br />
City line via Leakin Park at which point it joins a proposed<br />
expressway which would lead to Frederick. This extended<br />
West Radial, plus the northern segment of the inner ring and<br />
the East Radial, was now considered to represent the main<br />
stream of cross-town traffic. Thus was born the present East-<br />
West Expressway. It has little justification from the stand-<br />
point of through traffic (there obviously being only a small<br />
amount of Philadelphia-Frederick traffic) but makes a lot of<br />
sense in terms of local traffic.<br /><br />
b) To provide the north-south route in the Federal plan the<br />
Jones Falls Expressway was extended over the Inner Harbor<br />
and then continued in a southwesterly direction to tie in at<br />
the City line with a wholly new expressway to Washington.<br />
This extension of the Jones Falls Expressway is referred to<br />
as the Southwest Expressway. (The Master plan presently con-<br />
tains two alternate routes for the Southwest Expressway. Sheet<br />
6 only shows Alternate 2. Alternate 1 is not shown since it is<br />
regarded as an unlikely possibility. As a matter of fact, neither<br /><br />
11<br /><br />
alternate is as helpful in handling local traffic as would be a<br />
radial running more directly south in the direction of Glen<br />
Burnie. The Planning Commission hopes that it can reopen<br />
this question with the State Roads Commission at a later date.<br />
If a relocation can be worked out it would not affect the recom-<br />
mendations contained in this report.)<br /><br />
4. Creation of the East-West Expressway transferred the main<br />
traffic flow to the west rather than to the southwest, but it was<br />
still deemed advisable to retain the connection between the<br />
Mulberry-Franklin-Pine-Myrtle block and the Russell Street via-<br />
duct, both to provide the western segment of the inner ring and<br />
as a means of tying the present Washington-Baltimore Express-<br />
way in with the City’s expressway system. This connection was<br />
not, however, part of the Interstate System.<br /><br />
5. The connection referred to in Item 4 above comes within a few<br />
blocks of the Southwest Expressway. An expressway link across<br />
these blocks was therefore added to the Plan thus providing a<br />
southern closure of the inner ring some six to eight blocks south<br />
of Pratt Street. The Pratt Street Expressway was then removed<br />
from the Plan.<br /><br />
Events Since 1957<br /><br />
By the fall of 1957 design of the Jones Falls Expressway had pro-<br />
ceeded to the point where it became desirable to have some agreement<br />
with the State and the Federal Government on details of the interchange<br />
between the Jones Falls Expressway and the East-West Expressway. It<br />
was felt at the time that a complete interchange was essential permitting<br />
all eight movements without resort to surface streets. The Department<br />","Y<br />

Historical Background<br /><br /><br /><br />
of Planning had worked out several such interchange designs based upon<br />
the East-West Expressway being depressed through the Mt. Vernon area.<br />
The design generally regarded as the best was developed in the summer<br />
of 1957 and is shown on Sheet 14. Federal officials viewed this design<br />
unfavorably, however, holding that it was excessively costly and cumber-<br />
some. A series of informal conferences was held with Federal officials in<br />
the course of which many trial designs were developed and discarded.<br />
Finally, a suggestion was made that a successful design might be possible<br />
if the East-West Expressway approached the intersection from the west<br />
as a double-decked elevated structure. The suggestion was fruitful in that<br />
it did permit a complete intersection to be worked out which overcame<br />
previous Federal objections, but it had the unfortunate corollary of<br />
requiring the East-West Expressway to be elevated and double-decked<br />
from Myrtle Avenue to the Jones Falls Expressway. The Planning Com-<br />
mission was unhappy over this situation, but it appeared that no other<br />
solution was feasible. Upon advice from the Department of Public Works<br />
that a decision was necessary to avoid delay in the design of the Jones<br />
Falls Expressway, the Planning Commission reluctantly approved the pro-<br />
posed interchange design, informally in January of 1958, and formally<br />
in May.<br /><br />
Four months later, on September 17, 1958, the Planning Commission<br />
decided to reconsider this decision and instructed its staff to restudy the<br />
interchange problem in the hope that a feasible scheme could be developed<br />
that would allow the East-West Expressway to be depressed through the<br />
Mt. Vernon area. The Commission’s reconsideration was a result of<br />
several developments. In the first place, it became apparent that the need<br />
for a decision on the interchange was not as urgent as it had previously<br />
appeared. Next, further studies by the Department of Transit and Traffic<br />
indicated that some of the interchange movements were less important<br /><br /><br /><br />
12<br /><br />
than had been assumed. And, finally, the original decision had precipi-<br />
tated strong adverse public reaction.<br /><br />
Shortly after the Commission’s decision to reconsider, Mr. Robert O.<br />
Bonnell, then chairman of the State Roads Commission, acting on a<br />
suggestion from the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, organized a committee<br />
made up of various City, State and Federal officials. This committee,<br />
generally referred to as the Bonnell Committee, was intended to serve as<br />
a means for thrashing out differences of opinion on the expressway pro-<br />
gram and for reaching agreements among all of the officials concerned.<br />
While it was in existence the committee did resolve some unsettled points<br />
in the design of the Jones Falls Expressway, but it was less successful on<br />
reaching agreements on the East-West Expressway.<br /><br />
With respect to the interchange between the two expressways the<br />
committee reviewed the latest traffic analysis figures prepared by Mr.<br />
Henry A. Barnes, Commissioner of Transit and Traffic, and concluded<br />
that four of the movements were of fundamental importance and must be<br />
covered by the design. The four movements were from the north to the<br />
east and reverse, and from the east to the south and reverse. It was also<br />
agreed that two movements, from the west to the south and reverse, were<br />
of such negligible importance that they could be forgotten. The remaining<br />
two movements, from the north to the west and reverse, were of inter-<br />
mediate importance and occasioned considerable discussion. Mr. Bonnell<br />
suggested that the City explore the possibility of handling these move-<br />
ments through surface streets, improving or widening them if necessary.<br />
In accordance with this suggestion Mr. Barnes developed a proposal which<br />
is shown on Sheet 20. Under this scheme, southbound traffic desiring to<br />
go west on the East-West Expressway would leave the Jones Falls Ex-<br />
pressway at the North Avenue interchange and proceed along Mt. Royal<br />
Terrace and Cathedral Street to a connection with the East-West Ex-<br /><br /><br /><br />

pressway. Eastbound traffic on the East-West Expressway desiring to go<br />
north on the Jones Falls Expressway would follow the reverse path. No<br />
new construction would be necessary north of Cathedral Street (except<br />
that additional traffic on Mt. Royal Terrace between Cathedral Street and<br />
North Avenue might require a widening of the paved area through a<br />
reduction of the median strip) but Cathedral Street would be widened<br />
to the west by taking the property now occupied by the Deutsches House<br />
as well as some land now being cleared as part of the Mt. Royal Plaza.<br />
In addition, a few other properties would be acquired in order to effect the<br />
necessary connection between Cathedral Street and the East-West Ex-<br />
pressway. Cathedral Street would terminate at this connection. Surface<br />
traffic desiring to go further south would be handled by Maryland Avenue.<br /><br />
This proposal does not meet Federal Interstate Highway Standards<br />
and would not therefore be eligible for 90% Federal subsidy. (It would<br />
probably be eligible for 509 Federal subsidy under the so-called Urban<br />
Program.) With respect to the interchange between the Jones Falls<br />
Expressway and the East-West Expressway there would be no reduction<br />
in property takings in the Mt. Vernon area. The proposal does permit a<br />
simplified interchange to be designed as shown on Sheet 20.<br /><br />
Officials of the State Roads Commission indicated that it would be<br />
acceptable to them for the City to use this simplified intersection plan as a<br />
basis for proceeding with the Jones Falls Expressway and Mr. George<br />
Carter, then Director of Public Works, instructed the design engineers to<br />
go ahead accordingly. He informed them, however, to incorporate in their<br />
plans only those provisions for the interchange which were absolutely<br />
essential so that if the East-West Expressway were never built, or if it<br />
were built in some other location, no unsightly stubs for ramps would be<br />
left dangling into space.<br /><br />
13<br /><br />
All the events described above from the beginning of 1958 took place<br />
as a result of efforts to get on with the design of the Jones Falls Express-<br />
way. Nevertheless this required that considerable attention be devoted<br />
to the East-West Expressway and the resulting public controversy led<br />
Mayor D’Alesandro in September of 1958 to request the Department of<br />
Planning and the Planning Commission to make a further study of the<br />
Expressway route. The Mayor concluded his request by asking “. . ..<br />
that due consideration be given to the preservation of neighborhoods and<br />
the development of needed facilities for moving people, particularly the<br />
people of the Baltimore metropolitan area.” This report is the result of<br />
this request.<br /><br />

pressway. Eastbound traffic on the East-West Expressway desiring to go<br />
north on the Jones Falls Expressway would follow the reverse path. No<br />
new construction would be necessary north of Cathedral Street (except<br />
that additional traffic on Mt. Royal Terrace between Cathedral Street and<br />
North Avenue might require a widening of the paved area through a<br />
reduction of the median strip) but Cathedral Street would be widened<br />
to the west by taking the property now occupied by the Deutsches House<br />
as well as some land now being cleared as part of the Mt. Royal Plaza.<br />
In addition, a few other properties would be acquired in order to effect the<br />
necessary connection between Cathedral Street and the East-West Ex-<br />
pressway. Cathedral Street would terminate at this connection. Surface<br />
traffic desiring to go further south would be handled by Maryland Avenue.<br />
<br />
This proposal does not meet Federal Interstate Highway Standards<br />
and would not therefore be eligible for 90% Federal subsidy. (It would<br />
probably be eligible for 509 Federal subsidy under the so-called Urban<br />
Program.) With respect to the interchange between the Jones Falls<br />
Expressway and the East-West Expressway there would be no reduction<br />
in property takings in the Mt. Vernon area. The proposal does permit a<br />
simplified interchange to be designed as shown on Sheet 20.<br />
<br />
Officials of the State Roads Commission indicated that it would be<br />
acceptable to them for the City to use this simplified intersection plan as a<br />
basis for proceeding with the Jones Falls Expressway and Mr. George<br />
Carter, then Director of Public Works, instructed the design engineers to<br />
go ahead accordingly. He informed them, however, to incorporate in their<br />
plans only those provisions for the interchange which were absolutely<br />
essential so that if the East-West Expressway were never built, or if it<br />
were built in some other location, no unsightly stubs for ramps would be<br />
left dangling into space.<br />
<br />
13<br />
<br />
All the events described above from the beginning of 1958 took place<br />
as a result of efforts to get on with the design of the Jones Falls Express-<br />
way. Nevertheless this required that considerable attention be devoted<br />
to the East-West Expressway and the resulting public controversy led<br />
Mayor D’Alesandro in September of 1958 to request the Department of<br />
Planning and the Planning Commission to make a further study of the<br />
Expressway route. The Mayor concluded his request by asking “. . ..<br />
that due consideration be given to the preservation of neighborhoods and<br />
the development of needed facilities for moving people, particularly the<br />
people of the Baltimore metropolitan area.” This report is the result of<br />
this request.<br />

IV. TRAFFIC NEEDS<br /><br />
Traffic Growth<br /><br />
The customary basis for highway planning is an origin and desti-<br />
nation survey. In the past such surveys have usually been carried out<br />
through a combination of home interviews and interviews with the drivers<br />
of cars stopped at selected points. For a metropolitan area as large as<br />
Baltimore’s such a survey is expensive and time consuming. One was con-<br />
ducted jointly by the City and the State in 1945-46 (Transportation<br />
Study, Baltimore Metropolitan Area, see Chapter 1II), but there has been<br />
no comprehensive interview-type origin and destination survey since.<br /><br />
Within the last few years a new, simpler, and less expensive technique<br />
for developing origin and destination information has been worked out.<br />
It is based on the discovery that while the behavior of any one motorist<br />
is unpredictable the actions of large groups can be predicted with reason-<br />
able accuracy, provided there is available certain information on land use<br />
and on the distribution of population and of employment. With this<br />
information one can estimate present traffic volumes, and if the basic data<br />
is projected into the future one can predict future traffic volumes. This<br />
new approach is generally referred to as the gravity model technique since<br />
it postulates that certain areas attract traffic from other areas in a manner<br />
somewhat similar to the laws governing gravity.<br /><br />
This new technique served as the basis for a new set of metropolitan<br />
area traffic predictions made by the Baltimore Regional Planning Council.<br />
Most of the actual work was done by the Department of Transit and<br />
Traffic with the assistance of Mr. Alan M. Voorhees of the Automotive<br />
Safety Foundation. Mr. Voorhees is a noted planning and traffic authority<br />
who has played a leading role in the development and application of the<br />
gravity model technique. The results of these studies and a more detailed<br />
description of the techniques employed is set forth in a recent publication<br />
of the Regional Planning Council entitled Freeway Plan.<br /><br />
With respect to east-west travel across the City, the Regional Plan-<br /><br />
14<br /><br />
ning Council drew what was referred to as a screen line along the path<br />
of the Jones Falls Valley extending northward from the inner harbor to<br />
the outer edge of the developed area. Based upon information on existing<br />
land use, population distribution, and employment distribution, it was -<br />
estimated, using the gravity model approach, that the present peak-hour<br />
traffic crossing this screen line was 40,300 vehicles. To check the accuracy<br />
of this estimate the Department of Transit and Traffic then made an<br />
actual count which totaled 40,100.<br /><br />
The same techniques were then applied to the future and it was esti-<br />
mated that by 1980, 60,000 vehicles would cross the Jones Falls screen<br />
line during a peak hour. The increase in peak-hour traffic moving in an<br />
east-west direction across the developed sections of the City and the<br />
County from Pratt Street north is thus anticipated by 1980 to be 20,000<br />
vehicles.<br /><br />
Since the present east-west streets and highways are operating at<br />
about capacity (in many cases they are overloaded) all of this estimated<br />
increase would have to be handled by new routes or by widenings of exist-<br />
ing streets. If it is assumed (a) that future traffic increases would be™<br />
equally divided between east movements and west movements, (b) that<br />
all of the traffic increases would be handled by expressways, and (c¢) that<br />
one expressway lane can handle about 1,500 vehicles per hour, then ap-<br />
proximately 14 new expressway lanes would be required to carry future .<br />
east-west traffic.<br /><br />
In practice, however, 14 lanes would not be enough. East-west move-<br />
ments will not be evenly balanced and it would be highly desirable to<br />
provide some additional capacity to alleviate present congestion on exist-<br />
ing east-west streets. In the judgment of the Regional Planning Council |<br />

Completion of the County Beltway will take care of four lanes. Con-<br />
struction of the East-West Expressway, either as presently planned or<br />
in an alternative location, would provide another eight. New or improved<br />
surface streets (such as Northern Parkway) can be counted as the<br />
equivalent of two expressway lanes, and it is believed by the Regional<br />
Planning Council that improvements in public transportation may perhaps<br />
account for the equivalent of two more. All of these measures add up to<br />
16 lanes (or equivalent) leaving a deficit of four. Theoretically this deficit<br />
should be covered by the construction of a further east-west expressway<br />
at about Cold Spring Lane. The Regional Planning Council’s report<br />
leaves the subject at this point, but it was Mr. Voorhees’ personal con-<br />
clusion, concurred in by the Department of Planning, that the present<br />
figures and estimates are not sufficiently conclusive to warrant preparing<br />
definite plans for such an expressway at this time and that judgment as<br />
to its need should be reserved for the time being.<br /><br />
From the above figures it is clear that the presently planned East-<br />
West Expressway will be needed to take care of 409% to 50% of the<br />
expected increase in traffic over the next twenty years. Or looked at in<br />
another way, the anticipated increase in east-west traffic across the metro-<br />
politan area north of the inner harbor will be more than twice the capacity<br />
of the proposed East-West Expressway.<br /><br />
These conclusions hinge on the accuracy of the prediction that east-<br />
west traffic will increase by approximately 50% by 1980. This prediction<br />
in turn is the end-product of a series of mathematical computations<br />
which can be appraised only by experts in this field. We do know that<br />
the technique, when applied to existing traffic, checked out with good<br />
accuracy. Can we be equally confident of future predictions?<br /><br />
Let us first of all look at the predictions from the standpoint of<br />
general reasonability. The Regional Planning Council estimates that<br /><br />
15<br /><br />
population of the area will increase by 509% by 1980. This is approxi-<br />
mately the same rate of growth which has prevailed since 1940. The<br />
Council then estimates that vehicular registration will increase by 90%<br />
by 1980. In view of the fact that registrations increased by 50% in the<br />
eight-year period between 1950 and 1958, a 909% increase within 22 years<br />
would seem, if anything, to be conservative. Next the Council predicts<br />
that total mileage traveled within the area will increase by 70% by 1980.<br />
Since this is less than the increase in vehicles it can only mean that the<br />
average mileage per vehicle will be less than it is at present. Again this<br />
forecast seems conservative.<br /><br />
Against this background the prediction of a 509 increase in east-<br />
west travel by 1980 certainly does not seem unreasonably high. Further-<br />
more, even if this figure were in error by a considerable margin, there<br />
would still be ample justification for an East-West Expressway based<br />
upon traffic growth.<br /><br />
Through Traffic vs. Local Traffic<br /><br />
Questions have been raised as to the need or desirability of building<br />
an East-West Expressway through the center of the City based upon the<br />
belief that the traffic it will carry will be largely through traffic having<br />
neither origin nor destination in the Baltimore Metropolitan Area. It has<br />
been felt that handling this type of traffic hardly justified the demolition,<br />
the cost, and all of the other problems involved in creating an expressway<br />
through the heart of the City. Through traffic, it is held, is not funda-<br />
mentally the City’s problem and should be diverted either to the Harbor<br />
Tunnel or the Beltway, or, if these are insufficient, to another bypass<br />
route located at a considerable distance from the center of Baltimore.<br /><br />
It is not difficult to see how these questions have arisen. For many<br />

O o o dd e dedgddaddd<br /><br /><br /><br />
heavy flow of through traffic across Baltimore, mainly along Route 1 in<br />
the southwest and Route 40 through the center of the City and to the<br />
east. It was easy to assume that through traffic constituted the bulk of<br />
all traffic along these routes and that this would also be the case for any<br />
expressway generally following this path.<br /><br />
This assumption was never correct. Every analysis has consistently<br />
shown that through traffic was only a small fraction of total traffic. While<br />
most past proposals for cross-town expressways have followed the Route 1-<br />
Route 40 path, the reports accompanying these proposals have stated<br />
that the great bulk of anticipated traffic would be local, and it has been<br />
the volume of this local traffic which has been pointed to as the justifi-<br />
cation for the proposals.<br /><br />
The most thorough analysis of through traffic on the City’s proposed<br />
expressway system was prepared by the State Roads Commission in 1957.<br />
This study showed that through traffic on the East-West Expressway<br />
would range from 4% on the western leg to 6% on the eastern leg. No<br />
estimate was prepared of the total number of through vehicles which<br />
would travel the entire length of the East-West Expressway, but it is<br />
possible to deduce from the study that this number would be substantially<br />
less than 1,900 per day.<br /><br />
These results are in no way surprising. Studies and analyses in cities<br />
all over the country have uniformly demonstrated that of the traffic com-<br />
ing into a large urban area on any one major highway only a small<br />
percentage is through traffic. The American Association of State Highway<br />
Officials states that for cities of 500,000 to 1,000,000 this percentage is<br />
usually about 8%. (The percentage tends to increase for smaller cities.<br />
For cities in the 50,000 to 100,000 class it would be about 19%.)<br /><br />
The most certain fact about the East-West Expressway is that, if<br />
built, it will be mainly utilized by traffic having origin and/or destination<br /><br />

in the Baltimore metropolitan area.<br /><br />
Effect of Transit Improvements i<br />
Can improvement of our present public transportation system, or<br /><br />
development of some new form of rapid transit, minimize or eliminate the<br /><br />
need for additional freeways? Everyone would like to think so, but the<br /><br />
facts do not appear to be favorable.<br /><br />
Mass transportation is obviously a more efficient means of moving<br />
people than private automobiles. A loaded bus occupies much less street<br />
space than the number of cars which would transport the same number<br />
of people. Rapid transit operating on rail lines takes no street space at<br />
all. Furthermore, mass transportation eliminates the need for parking<br />
spaces at destination points.<br /><br />
The fact remains that mass transit is not realizing these potentialities™<br /><br />
in Baltimore or in most other large cities. Since World War II there has<br />
been a consistent pattern of declining patronage, deteriorating service,<br /><br /><br /><br />

and higher fares. The growing gap between possibility and performance |<br /><br />
plus increasing dependence upon the private automobile with all the<br />
ensuing problems of congestion, need for expensive new traffic facilities,<br />
etc., have focused attention upon the mass transportation problem.<br />
Within the past few years a number of studies have been made of mass<br />

<br />
heavy flow of through traffic across Baltimore, mainly along Route 1 in<br />
the southwest and Route 40 through the center of the City and to the<br />
east. It was easy to assume that through traffic constituted the bulk of<br />
all traffic along these routes and that this would also be the case for any<br />
expressway generally following this path.<br />
<br />
This assumption was never correct. Every analysis has consistently<br />
shown that through traffic was only a small fraction of total traffic. While<br />
most past proposals for cross-town expressways have followed the Route 1-<br />
Route 40 path, the reports accompanying these proposals have stated<br />
that the great bulk of anticipated traffic would be local, and it has been<br />
the volume of this local traffic which has been pointed to as the justifi-<br />
cation for the proposals.<br />
<br />
The most thorough analysis of through traffic on the City’s proposed<br />
expressway system was prepared by the State Roads Commission in 1957.<br />
This study showed that through traffic on the East-West Expressway<br />
would range from 4% on the western leg to 6% on the eastern leg. No<br />
estimate was prepared of the total number of through vehicles which<br />
would travel the entire length of the East-West Expressway, but it is<br />
possible to deduce from the study that this number would be substantially<br />
less than 1,900 per day.<br />
<br />
These results are in no way surprising. Studies and analyses in cities<br />
all over the country have uniformly demonstrated that of the traffic com-<br />
ing into a large urban area on any one major highway only a small<br />
percentage is through traffic. The American Association of State Highway<br />
Officials states that for cities of 500,000 to 1,000,000 this percentage is<br />
usually about 8%. (The percentage tends to increase for smaller cities.<br />
For cities in the 50,000 to 100,000 class it would be about 19%.)<br />
<br />
The most certain fact about the East-West Expressway is that, if<br />
built, it will be mainly utilized by traffic having origin and/or destination<br />

Effect of Transit Improvements i<br />
Can improvement of our present public transportation system, or<br />
<br />
development of some new form of rapid transit, minimize or eliminate the<br />
<br />
need for additional freeways? Everyone would like to think so, but the<br />
<br />
facts do not appear to be favorable.<br />
<br />
Mass transportation is obviously a more efficient means of moving<br />
people than private automobiles. A loaded bus occupies much less street<br />
space than the number of cars which would transport the same number<br />
of people. Rapid transit operating on rail lines takes no street space at<br />
all. Furthermore, mass transportation eliminates the need for parking<br />
spaces at destination points.<br />
<br />
The fact remains that mass transit is not realizing these potentialities™<br />
<br />
in Baltimore or in most other large cities. Since World War II there has<br />
been a consistent pattern of declining patronage, deteriorating service,<br />

and higher fares. The growing gap between possibility and performance |<br />
<br />
plus increasing dependence upon the private automobile with all the<br />
ensuing problems of congestion, need for expensive new traffic facilities,<br />
etc., have focused attention upon the mass transportation problem.<br />
Within the past few years a number of studies have been made of mass<br />
transportation in the Baltimore area, notably the 1955 report of the<br />
Commission on Mass Transportation (the Committee was appointed by<br />
the Mayor and was headed by Dr. Abel Wolman), a report in three parts<br />
issued by Mr. Henry A. Barnes, Commissioner of Transit and Traffic, in<br />

The following points are made by one or more of these reports:<br />
1. All reports agree that a subway system is not feasible for Balti-<br /><br />
more. The report of the Committee on Mass Transportation<br />
summarizes this common viewpoint as follows: ‘“Baltimore is far<br />
from an ideal city for the building of subways in which trains of<br />
cars are operated on fixed ballasted rails. The streets are quite<br />
narrow; there are a number of hills, which would call for deep<br />
subway tunnels and long steps, escalators or elevators for reaching<br />
the ground surface; much rock would be encountered in the north-<br />
ern and northwestern areas of the City, and the spokes-of-a-wheel<br />
passenger movement pattern make it difficult to contemplate that<br />
subways costing $250,000,000 or more are economically, politically<br />
or physically justified when comparison is made with other types<br />
of rapid transit which may be available.”<br /><br />
. All reports agree that with respect to monorails many engineering<br /><br />
problems remain to be solved and that no present reliance can be<br />
placed upon this system. The Committee on Mass Transportation<br />
adds this comment: ‘“The prospect of such overhead construction<br />
in our Baltimore streets, approaching as it will an elevated rail<br />
system in the amount of light and air intercepted and the amount<br />
of noise emitted is not a happy one.”<br /><br />
. The Committee on Mass Transportation suggests that existing<br /><br />
railroad lines might be converted to rapid transit use. Mr. Barnes<br />
feels that this proposal is not feasible, in part because of sparse<br />
development along these rights-of-way and in part because com-<br />
muters would have to be brought to the railroad lines by bus or<br />
by auto. Such “divided trips” would, he feels, discourage patron-<br />
age. The Regional Planning Council study endeavors to explore<br />
in some detail the possibility of utilizing existing rail lines for<br /><br />
17<br /><br />
rapid transit purposes. It suggests that three rail rapid transit<br />
lines could extend out from the center of the City to the north-<br />
east, the north, and the northwest. A southern terminal is pro-<br />
posed at Charles Center by means of a tunnel from the Calvert<br />
Street Station. An analysis was made of the population in the<br />
districts served, the extent to which this population might be<br />
employed in the central business district, and the extent to which<br />
the proposed lines might be utilized. It is estimated that trip-to-<br />
work patronage in 1980 might total 15,000, of which, however,<br />
only 10,000 would represent a shift from private automobiles.<br />
The remaining 5,000 would, in the absence of the proposed rapid<br />
transit, be using buses.<br /><br />
All discussion of rail rapid transit is based upon a system designed<br />
to service downtown and which would be only of incidental benefit<br />
to other employment areas. While the reports do not so state,<br />
this emphasis on downtown clearly stems from the fact that there<br />
are no other traffic generators in the metropolitan area, now or<br />
foreseeable, of sufficient size, compactness, or ability to develop<br />
non-rush hour traffic to support any type of rail rapid transit<br />
system without exorbitant subsidy.<br /><br />
With respect to buses the Committee on Mass Transportation<br />
states that: ‘“Mass transportation free-wheel buses (not trackless<br />
trolleys or rail facilities under any circumstances) must have free<br />
access on, along and off such [expressways]. Once on the [ex-<br />

until they reach their point of exit. Good entry and egress, of<br />
course, must be provided for the buses and other free-wheeled<br />

involve the collection of a load on special busways connecting to<br />
the expressways. Some intermediate stops might be made by<br />

on a high speed expressway are not generally feasible since they<br />

to private vehicular transportation.<br /><br />
2. If we are thinking in terms of a rail system it can only be in<br />

Let us now explore the second of these conclusions in greater detail.<br />
The purpose of a rail system oriented to serve the central business district<br />
would be, of course, to induce car riders to transfer to rapid transit and<br />
thus reduce the number of cars coming into the central business district.<br />
Since traffic congestion is most acute during rush hours, the problem can<br />
be further narrowed to a consideration of the potential reduction in the<br />
number of cars bringing workers to employment in the central business<br />
district.<br /><br />
Some indication of the range of this potential reduction can be ob-<br />
tained through three separate approaches:<br /><br />
1. A survey conducted by the Planning Council in 1958 indicates<br /><br />
18<br /><br />
that 539 of central business district employees travel to work by<br />
public transportation. How high might this percentage be, given<br />
sufficient improvement of our public transportation system? The<br />
Planning Council, in its Plan for the Central Business District of<br />
Baltimore, has expressed its judgment, based on a survey of other<br />
cities, that at very most this percentage could only be increased<br />
to 689%. The difference of 15% applied against total central<br />
business district employment of 96,000 represents 14,500 persons.<br />
Assuming 115 persons per car the conversion of 14,500 persons<br />
from car to rapid transit would reduce the total number of cars<br /><br />
coming into the central business district during rush hours by<br /><br />
about 10,000.<br /><br />
. The Planning Council survey mentioned above also provides a<br /><br />
different approach to the question. This survey indicated that of<br />
the 96,000 persons employed in the central business district, about<br />
one-quarter, or approximately 24,000, drive cars to work. Of this<br />
number about one-half indicate that they need their cars during<br />
the day for business reasons, or use them for various auxiliary<br />
purposes during the trip to or from work. It is unlikely that this<br />
group could be converted to public transportation regardless of<br />
improvements made. This leaves approximately 12,000 drivers<br />
who theoretically might be converted. If all were converted the<br />
reduction in cars coming into the central business district for<br />

absence of the rail system, would be traveling by automobile.<br />
This many persons would be traveling in about 7,000 cars.<br /><br />
We thus have varying estimates of a potential reduction of cars<br />
coming into the central business district for employment purposes of<br />
12,000, 10,000 and 7,000.<br /><br />
The first two figures are in the nature of theoretical maximums and<br />
as a practical matter are obviously too high. The third is undoubtedly<br />
more realistic, but even this estimate may be optimistic. Since it is based<br />
upon 1980 population figures it certainly overstates present possibilities.<br />
Nevertheless, let us accept this figure for the purpose of discussion. As-<br />
suming an average round trip of 20 miles per day 7,000 cars would<br />
generate 140,000 vehicle miles per day. This compares with 12,000,000<br />
vehicle miles per day now being traveled in the Baltimore metropolitan<br />
area and 20,000,000 vehicle miles per day predicted by 1980. Evidently<br /><br />
v ,+the elimination of 7,000 cars will not seriously alter the traffic problem.<br /><br />
Furthermore, the greatest concentration of homes of downtown employees<br />
is to the north, and since the 7,000 car estimate is based upon a possible<br />
rail system extending only in a northerly direction from the central busi-<br />
ness district, the car travel which such a rail system might eliminate<br />
would be north-south traffic. The east-west traffic which serves as one of<br />
the main justifications for the Kast-West Expressway would hardly be<br />
affected.<br /><br />
None of these points should be taken as meaning that there is no<br />
need to establish a much improved and more comprehensive system of<br />
public transportation. For one thing, the basic strength of the central<br />
business district is in its accessibility to all parts of the metropolitan area.<br />
This means accessibility in terms of all types of transportation—not just<br />
automobile transportation. An improvement in public transportation to<br />
the central business district will certainly enhance its competitive position.<br /><br />
i9<br /><br />
Of great importance, too, is the fact that increased use of public trans-<br />
portation will ease the downtown parking problem.<br /><br />
Furthermore, it will be recalled from the figures quoted earlier in this<br />
chapter that of the 20 expressway lanes (or equivalent) needed to meet<br />
anticipated east-west traffic increases by 1980 (and to provide a minimum<br />
reduction in present congestion), it was assumed, somewhat arbitrarily,<br />

absence of the rail system, would be traveling by automobile.<br />
This many persons would be traveling in about 7,000 cars.<br />
<br />
We thus have varying estimates of a potential reduction of cars<br />
coming into the central business district for employment purposes of<br />
12,000, 10,000 and 7,000.<br />
<br />
The first two figures are in the nature of theoretical maximums and<br />
as a practical matter are obviously too high. The third is undoubtedly<br />
more realistic, but even this estimate may be optimistic. Since it is based<br />
upon 1980 population figures it certainly overstates present possibilities.<br />
Nevertheless, let us accept this figure for the purpose of discussion. As-<br />
suming an average round trip of 20 miles per day 7,000 cars would<br />
generate 140,000 vehicle miles per day. This compares with 12,000,000<br />
vehicle miles per day now being traveled in the Baltimore metropolitan<br />
area and 20,000,000 vehicle miles per day predicted by 1980. Evidently<br />
<br />
v ,+the elimination of 7,000 cars will not seriously alter the traffic problem.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the greatest concentration of homes of downtown employees<br />
is to the north, and since the 7,000 car estimate is based upon a possible<br />
rail system extending only in a northerly direction from the central busi-<br />
ness district, the car travel which such a rail system might eliminate<br />
would be north-south traffic. The east-west traffic which serves as one of<br />
the main justifications for the Kast-West Expressway would hardly be<br />
affected.<br />
<br />
None of these points should be taken as meaning that there is no<br />
need to establish a much improved and more comprehensive system of<br />
public transportation. For one thing, the basic strength of the central<br />
business district is in its accessibility to all parts of the metropolitan area.<br />
This means accessibility in terms of all types of transportation—not just<br />
automobile transportation. An improvement in public transportation to<br />
the central business district will certainly enhance its competitive position.<br />
<br />
i9<br />
<br />
Of great importance, too, is the fact that increased use of public trans-<br />
portation will ease the downtown parking problem.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it will be recalled from the figures quoted earlier in this<br />
chapter that of the 20 expressway lanes (or equivalent) needed to meet<br />
anticipated east-west traffic increases by 1980 (and to provide a minimum<br />
reduction in present congestion), it was assumed, somewhat arbitrarily,<br />
that the equivalent of two lanes would be provided by unspecified transit<br />
improvements. In addition, four other lanes were unaccounted for on the<br />
basis that further experience might indicate that they would not be<br />
needed. Past experience has shown, however, that future traffic predic-<br />

expressway traffic onto surface streets within the central business district<br />
can cause acute congestion in the vicinity of access ramps. By keeping<br />
expressways some distance away from the central business district it is<br />
alleged that property damage can be minimized and that through traffic<br />
can be diverted around the central business district.<br /><br />
Prohibitive land acquisition costs would bar an expressway from the<br />
central business district itself. The question at issue then is an expressway<br />
along the boundaries of the central business district as against an express-<br />
way some distance further eut. For the reasons presented below it is<br />
believed that the best location for an expressway is as close to the central<br />
business district as is feasible.<br /><br />
1. The argument that distance from the central business district<br />
minimizes property damage is often fallacious. In many cases the<br />
easiest place to locate an expressway is in the belt of slums that<br />
surrounds the central business district. As one moves away from<br />
the boundary of the central business district building quality is<br />
apt to improve.<br /><br />
2. The further one moves away from the central business district<br />
the more elaborate and extensive must be the expressway network<br />

the central business district.<br /><br />
3. Some traffic entering Baltimore’s central business district comes<br />
in on -one radial artery for the purpose of leaving on another<br />
radial artery going off at an angle. Most traffic passing through,<br />
however, does so because the central business district lies on the<br />
most direct line from origin to destination. Experience has shown<br />
that an expressway will cause much traffic to divert from the most<br />
direct path, but the percentage of traffic doing so will be in pro-<br />
portion to the degree of diversion. An expressway some distance<br /><br /><br /><br />
from the central business district will not, therefore, remove so<br />
much traffic from surface streets within the central business dis-<br />
trict as will an expressway close to the central business district.<br /><br />
. There is no reason why an expressway should not serve a variety<br /><br />
of purposes—in fact there is probably no such thing as a single-<br />
purpose urban expressway. An expressway can well provide both<br />
access to the central business district and a means for bypassing<br />
the central business district. The problem of congestion surround-<br />
ing access ramps leading to the central business district is simply<br />
a question of proper design. The fact that this problem has been<br />
poorly handled in some cities does not mean that it must be<br />
poorly handled here.<br /><br />

these questions.<br /><br />
What Are Expressways?<br /><br />
The basic street pattern of a modern city consists of a rectangular<br />
grid of surface streets dividing the city into blocks or squares. Occasion-<br />
ally a radial street will be superimposed on this pattern. The streets serve<br />
two principal purposes: They provide access to abutting properties and<br />
they permit the movement of traffic around and through the City. Traffic<br />
moving on any one street conflicts with other traffic at every street inter-<br />
section point.<br /><br /><br /><br />
21<br /><br />
Our modern city streets may be better in many details than streets<br />
in ancient or medieval cities, and in recent years we have evolved many<br />
new techniques for handling and controlling traffic, but the basic physical<br />
pattern of our urban streets is no different today from the pattern 1000<br />
or 2000 years ago. It has been said that expressways “represent the first<br />
major innovation in highway design since the wagon road replaced the<br />
footpath.”<br /><br />
Expressways differ from ordinary city streets in these important<br /><br />
respects:<br /><br />
(a) There is no direct access between expressways and adjacent<br />
property. (Indirect access occurs, of course, through ramps<br />
leading to surface streets.)<br /><br />
(b) There are no intersections with other streets or railroads. Ex-<br />
pressways pass either over or under.<br /><br />
(c) Left turns into opposing traffic are eliminated.<br /><br />
(d) Pedestrians are barred.<br /><br />
(e) Parking is banned.<br /><br />
To effect a separation between expressway traffic and other traffic,<br />
expressways in developed urban areas are nearly always depressed or<br />
elevated. Exceptions occur when an expressway can be routed to take<br />
advantage of topographical or physical barriers to the continuation of the<br />

The Pros and Cons of Expressways<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
been constructed and this type is relatively common.<br /><br />
A few early examples of urban expressways also exist. The Pulaski<br />
Skyway from the Newark Airport to the Holland Tunnel is one such.<br />
No motorist who endeavored to negotiate the northern New Jersey indus-<br />
trial flats prior to its construction will forget the fantastic congestion<br />
which then existed on the surface streets. Hours were required to cover a<br />
few miles. The West Side Highway in New York City running south<br />
from 72nd Street is another early example. We don’t often think of the<br />
Orleans Street Viaduct here in Baltimore as an expressway, but this is<br />
essentially what it is. It has performed satisfactorily for some twenty-<br />
five years.<br /><br />
Despite these early examples it is only within the last few years that<br />
a large-scale program of urban expressways has gotten under way in cities<br />
all over the country. Even now only a few hundred miles of urban ex-<br />
pressways have been completed and are in use.<br /><br />
Expressways Are Safer<br /><br />
There appears to be no doubt whatsoever that expressways are much<br />
safer than normal city streets. Statistics assembled on this subject over<br />
a number of years by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads show that urban<br />
expressways are approximately twice as safe as city streets in terms of<br />
fatal accidents and approximately five times as safe in terms of total<br />
accidents. The record to date shows a cumulative fatality rate of 2.3 per<br />
hundred million vehicle miles on urban expressways compared to 4.2 for<br />
other city streets. The corresponding figures for all accidents are 154<br />
and 751.<br /><br />
The Morning Sun for August 4, 1959, commented editorially on this<br />
subject as follows:<br /><br />
“The statistics building up both in Maryland and elsewhere<br /><br />
22<br /><br />
show how much safer controlled access highways are. Nationwide,<br />
the turnpikes like the New Jersey and Pennsylvania turnpikes and<br />
the New York Thruway are the most striking examples of roadside<br />
control. And despite the higher speeds allowed, they are definitely<br />
safer. It was recently announced that the death rate for turnpikes<br />
in 1958 was only 1.3 for every 100,000,000 vehicle miles. It was 2.3—<br />
almost double—for other highways and roads.<br /><br />
“Right here in Maryland a small but significant sample tells a<br />
similar story. Both US Route 13 from Salisbury to the Virginia<br />
line and US Route 40 from Baltimore to Frederick have portions of<br />
highway with controlled access and portions with unlimited access.<br />
The controlled portions were markedly safer. The State Roads<br />
Commission reports that on Route 13 there were no fatal accidents<br />
at all last year on the controlled stretch compared to a rate of 12.4<br />
deaths per 100,000,000 vehicle miles on the unlimited portion of the<br />
dual highway. On Route 40, the rate was 3.4 on the controlled<br />
stretch against a 9.8 figure for the unlimited access part of it just<br />
outside Baltimore City.<br /><br />
“True, these figures are based on happily few deaths in each<br />

been constructed and this type is relatively common.<br />
<br />
A few early examples of urban expressways also exist. The Pulaski<br />
Skyway from the Newark Airport to the Holland Tunnel is one such.<br />
No motorist who endeavored to negotiate the northern New Jersey indus-<br />
trial flats prior to its construction will forget the fantastic congestion<br />
which then existed on the surface streets. Hours were required to cover a<br />
few miles. The West Side Highway in New York City running south<br />
from 72nd Street is another early example. We don’t often think of the<br />
Orleans Street Viaduct here in Baltimore as an expressway, but this is<br />
essentially what it is. It has performed satisfactorily for some twenty-<br />
five years.<br />
<br />
Despite these early examples it is only within the last few years that<br />
a large-scale program of urban expressways has gotten under way in cities<br />
all over the country. Even now only a few hundred miles of urban ex-<br />
pressways have been completed and are in use.<br />
<br />
Expressways Are Safer<br />
<br />
There appears to be no doubt whatsoever that expressways are much<br />
safer than normal city streets. Statistics assembled on this subject over<br />
a number of years by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads show that urban<br />
expressways are approximately twice as safe as city streets in terms of<br />
fatal accidents and approximately five times as safe in terms of total<br />
accidents. The record to date shows a cumulative fatality rate of 2.3 per<br />
hundred million vehicle miles on urban expressways compared to 4.2 for<br />
other city streets. The corresponding figures for all accidents are 154<br />
and 751.<br />
<br />
The Morning Sun for August 4, 1959, commented editorially on this<br />
subject as follows:<br />
<br />
“The statistics building up both in Maryland and elsewhere<br />
<br />
22<br />
<br />
show how much safer controlled access highways are. Nationwide,<br />
the turnpikes like the New Jersey and Pennsylvania turnpikes and<br />
the New York Thruway are the most striking examples of roadside<br />
control. And despite the higher speeds allowed, they are definitely<br />
safer. It was recently announced that the death rate for turnpikes<br />
in 1958 was only 1.3 for every 100,000,000 vehicle miles. It was 2.3—<br />
almost double—for other highways and roads.<br />
<br />
“Right here in Maryland a small but significant sample tells a<br />
similar story. Both US Route 13 from Salisbury to the Virginia<br />
line and US Route 40 from Baltimore to Frederick have portions of<br />
highway with controlled access and portions with unlimited access.<br />
The controlled portions were markedly safer. The State Roads<br />
Commission reports that on Route 13 there were no fatal accidents<br />
at all last year on the controlled stretch compared to a rate of 12.4<br />
deaths per 100,000,000 vehicle miles on the unlimited portion of the<br />
dual highway. On Route 40, the rate was 3.4 on the controlled<br />
stretch against a 9.8 figure for the unlimited access part of it just<br />
outside Baltimore City.<br />
<br />
“True, these figures are based on happily few deaths in each<br />
case. One bad two-car accident anywhere could wrench the statistics<br />
into a quite different relationship. But the experience on other high-<br />
ways with tight roadside control suggests rather that the first com-<br />
parable figures here in Maryland are following the normal pattern.<br />
If the argument for beauty alone has failed to move Maryland’s<br />
legislators as much as it should, perhaps the growing argument for<br />
safety will help turn them into proponents of truly tight roadside<br />
control of new super-highways.”<br />

streets and to cause a substantial drop in rush hour traffic on secondary<br />

Because traffic congestion is at its worst during the two peak hours<br />
in the early morning and in the late afternoon we tend to concentrate our<br />
attention on this rush-hour traffic. Equally important in its blighting<br />
effect on residential neighborhoods is, however, the fact that heavy<br />

handle all, or virtually all, through traffic during non-rush hours. The<br />
really dramatic effect of expressways in relieving existing streets will thus<br />
probably occur during non-peak hours.<br /><br />
Heavy truck traffic through the City represents a special aspect of<br />
the blighting effect of traffic. This situation was recently highlighted in<br />
Baltimore by a series of regulations issued by Mr. Henry A. Barnes, Com-<br />
missioner of Transit and Traffic, controlling truck traffic in the Northeast<br />
Baltimore. Under the heading of Blight Prevention the Sun for August 5,<br />
1959, commented editorially as follows:<br /><br />
“While urban renewal is not his field, Mr. Henry Barnes is<br />
working for that branch of government in curbing truck traffic on<br />
thoroughfares in new residential areas. Truckers may not see it that<br />
way, but to outsiders it is painfully clear that if Mr. Barnes failed<br />
to give homeowners in Northeast Baltimore some relief from the<br />
thundering herd of night crawlers, the area in a few years’ time<br />
would become the subject of costly blight-eradication programs.<br /><br />
“Unlike the railroads, the trucks have no right-of-way of their<br />
own. If they snarl traffic at busy hours, no local government forces<br />
them to build an overpass or underpass, as is the case with their<br />
rival form of heavy freight carriers. The trucks depend on the<br />
public streets. The public has the right to impose restrictions on<br />
their use of these streets out of consideration for the general welfare.<br />
Mr. Barnes has been acting in accordance with the larger consid-<br />
eration, and in preserving the peace and quiet of residential areas he<br />
is saving the city the grief that comes when it must take action after<br />
a neighborhood has gone downhill.”<br /><br />
Without in any way minimizing the importance or desirability of<br />
Mr. Barnes’ action, it is appropriate to note that while the City has the<br /><br />
- power to regulate truck traffic it cannot wholly bar trucks from City<br /><br />
24<br /><br />
streets. Eliminating trucks from some surface streets may simply push<br />
them over on to other surface streets. The tendency is for truck routes<br />
to end up passing through those areas having the least articulate occu-<br />
pants. These again tend to be the older blighted areas of the City. Truck<br />
regulations may protect the newer better neighborhoods of the City, but<br />
often at the expense of efforts to renew the older sections. Actions which<br />
further the Urban Renewal Program in one area may serve to impede<br />
it in others.<br /><br />
Again, expressways can help to solve the problem. To the extent that<br />
heavy truck movements can be confined to expressways they can be totally<br />

The Pros and Cons of Expressways<br /><br />

complete solution.<br /><br />
Expressways Can Create Blight<br /><br />
While expressways can reduce materially the blighting effect of<br />
through traffic on surface streets, expressways themselves can be blighting<br />
agents if they are not properly located and designed. This can happen<br />
in several ways:<br /><br />
1. Physical Barriers: An expressway can act as a physical barrier<br />
making more difficult communication and circulation between land<br />
on one side and land on the other. The extent to which this bar-<br />
rier exists depends to a considerable degree upon the type of<br />
construction. A depressed expressway will not be an important<br />
barrier if all intersecting streets are bridged over the expressway;<br />
to the extent that some previously existing streets are not bridged<br />
the degree of separation will be increased. Expressways elevated<br />
on a structure generally allow free access beneath the structure<br />
and thus represent no physical barrier, although the structure<br />
itself may act as a psychological barrier. Expressways elevated<br />
on an embankment or running along the surface generally permit<br />
the fewest crossings and thus act as the greatest barriers.<br /><br />
The importance of the separating effect of an expressway depends<br />
upon the land use on either side. It is generally of little or no<br />
importance if the expressway runs along some natural feature<br />
which itself acts as a barrier—down a ravine, along a waterfront,<br />
etc. It is normally not of great importance (and sometimes help-<br />
ful) if the land use on one side differs from the land use on the<br />
other—e.g., along the dividing line between residential and indus-<br />
trial development. The same conclusion generally applies if the<br />
expressway serves to divide well-established residential neighbor-<br /><br />
25<br /><br />
hoods. On the other hand, the barrier formed by an expressway<br />
can be definitely harmful when the expressway passes through<br />
the middle of an established neighborhood, and the higher the<br />
quality of the neighborhood the more harmful the effect is apt<br />
to be. An expressway can also be detrimental when it serves to<br />
separate areas which should be in close proximity for economic or<br />
business reasons. An expressway embankment with few crossings<br />
passing through the middle of a single industrial holding would<br />
be an extreme example.<br /><br />
. Noise: The noise created by an expressway can have an adverse<br /><br />
effect on surrounding properties, although it is usually less bother-<br />
some than one would think considering the volume and speed of<br />
the traffic involved. The noise tends to be steady and this type of<br />
noise is usually less objectionable than the alternate roars and<br />
silences of passing rush hour slugs of traffic along important one-<br />
way streets. The worst noise associated with an expressway is<br />
created by heavy trucks negotiating up-grades on access ramps.<br />

complete solution.<br />
<br />
Expressways Can Create Blight<br />
<br />
While expressways can reduce materially the blighting effect of<br />
through traffic on surface streets, expressways themselves can be blighting<br />
agents if they are not properly located and designed. This can happen<br />
in several ways:<br />
<br />
1. Physical Barriers: An expressway can act as a physical barrier<br />
making more difficult communication and circulation between land<br />
on one side and land on the other. The extent to which this bar-<br />
rier exists depends to a considerable degree upon the type of<br />
construction. A depressed expressway will not be an important<br />
barrier if all intersecting streets are bridged over the expressway;<br />
to the extent that some previously existing streets are not bridged<br />
the degree of separation will be increased. Expressways elevated<br />
on a structure generally allow free access beneath the structure<br />
and thus represent no physical barrier, although the structure<br />
itself may act as a psychological barrier. Expressways elevated<br />
on an embankment or running along the surface generally permit<br />
the fewest crossings and thus act as the greatest barriers.<br />
<br />
The importance of the separating effect of an expressway depends<br />
upon the land use on either side. It is generally of little or no<br />
importance if the expressway runs along some natural feature<br />
which itself acts as a barrier—down a ravine, along a waterfront,<br />
etc. It is normally not of great importance (and sometimes help-<br />
ful) if the land use on one side differs from the land use on the<br />
other—e.g., along the dividing line between residential and indus-<br />
trial development. The same conclusion generally applies if the<br />
expressway serves to divide well-established residential neighbor-<br />
<br />
25<br />
<br />
hoods. On the other hand, the barrier formed by an expressway<br />
can be definitely harmful when the expressway passes through<br />
the middle of an established neighborhood, and the higher the<br />
quality of the neighborhood the more harmful the effect is apt<br />
to be. An expressway can also be detrimental when it serves to<br />
separate areas which should be in close proximity for economic or<br />
business reasons. An expressway embankment with few crossings<br />
passing through the middle of a single industrial holding would<br />
be an extreme example.<br />
<br />
. Noise: The noise created by an expressway can have an adverse<br />
<br />
effect on surrounding properties, although it is usually less bother-<br />
some than one would think considering the volume and speed of<br />
the traffic involved. The noise tends to be steady and this type of<br />
noise is usually less objectionable than the alternate roars and<br />
silences of passing rush hour slugs of traffic along important one-<br />
way streets. The worst noise associated with an expressway is<br />
created by heavy trucks negotiating up-grades on access ramps.<br />
Ordinarily the noise factor is a problem only with respect to<br />
residential structures facing elevated or on-grade expressways.<br />
For other types of structures the noise will be no more harmful<br />
(and in most cases less troublesome) than the general level of<br />
traffic noise now prevailing on major surface streets. The nature<br />
of construction for a depressed expressway generally results in<br />
the expressway lanes being some distance from the nearest build-<br />
ings and this plus the difference in grades usually minimizes the<br />
noise problem. For this and other reasons depressed expressways<br />
are greatly to be preferred through residential areas.<br />
<br />
A difficult noise problem can be created by the lower deck of a<br />
double-decked elevated structure in close proximity to residential<br />

buildings at approximately the same level as bedroom windows.<br />
Traffic on the lower level is noisier than that on the top level<br />
since the noise can reverberate between the two decks. The prob-<br />
lem is minimized by using a single level structure, by raising the<br />
structure some distance above bedroom windows, or by increasing<br />
the distance between the structure and the residential buildings.<br />
An expressway designed in this manner with 75-foot to 100-foot<br />
separation from nearby residential buildings and without nearby<br />
access ramps will probably create less noise than a normally busy<br />
adjacent city street.<br /><br />
. Light and Air: An elevated expressway can serve to cut off light<br /><br />
and air from the lower stories of adjacent buildings. This problem<br />
is important for residences, retail trade buildings, and probably<br />
offices. It is of less importance for industrial buildings and of no<br />
importance for warehouses. It is generally of little consequence<br />
if only a corner of a building is in close proximity.<br /><br />
A separation of 30 feet to 40 feet between the expressway and<br />
adjacent buildings will usually be sufficient to minimize this prob-<br />
lem. A somewhat greater distance, say 50 feet to 60 feet, would<br />
probably be desirable if the expressway is double-decked.<br /><br />
. Partial Takings: Properties remaining after clearance for an ex-<br /><br />
pressway can produce a most untidy and unpleasant appearance<br />
which may have a blighting effect on the neighborhood. This<br />
result will not occur when clearance comes up to an existing<br />
street so that the nearest buildings are those facing the opposite<br />
side of the street. The blighting effect is usually most acute when<br />
the expressway runs diagonally across the existing street pattern.<br />
When this happens a great many small triangular pieces of land<br />
are left over, back yards are exposed, and building rows are cut<br /><br />
in the middle.<br /><br />
In some circumstances it is possible that over a period of time<br />
adjacent properties will be rebuilt so as to reflect the existence<br />
of the expressway. In this manner the scars left by the express-<br />
way may ultimately be removed. Such a process often requires,<br />
however, the consolidation and rearrangement of the lots in<br />
question and is not easily accomplished without public action. It<br />
is perhaps not wholly coincidental that several public housing<br />
projects and Renewal Area 4 lie adjacent to Fayette Street which<br />
was widened in 1937, that the Mt. Royal Plaza Renewal Area lies<br />
on both sides of the extension of Howard Street constructed in<br />
1938, and that Renewal Area 7 lies on both sides of Russell Street<br />
widened in 1953.<br /><br />
To minimize the blighting effect of partial takings in heavily<br />
developed areas it is desirable to run expressways between two<br />
parallel streets and to clear all of the land between these streets.<br />
Such an arrangement is also desirable from a traffic point of view<br />
since it facilitates the construction of access ramps at appropriate<br />
points and permits the border streets to be used for the collection<br />

The Pros and Cons of Expressways<br /><br /><br /><br />
located at greater distances from expressways. Approximately 500 sales<br />
were investigated and in each case an interview was conducted with both<br />
the seller and the buyer. The houses adjoining the expressway were<br />
located from 75 to 200 feet from the expressway traffic with the majority<br />
of the houses being within 150 feet. Most of the houses were at the same<br />
level as the expressway or at a lower level.<br /><br />
The results of the study showed that the sales prices for houses<br />
adjoining the expressway were approximately 1% to 29% lower than the<br />
houses away from the expressway. This difference is hardly large enough<br />
to be significant. In the course of the interviews 429, of the residents<br />
living adjacent to expressways indicated that the noise did not bother<br />
them, 339 were recorded as having “slight objection,” and 109 stated<br />
that they were bothered only by trucks. The remaining 159% found the<br />
noise objectionable. In response to a question on their general reaction<br />
to the location, 48% of the residents living adjacent to expressways stated<br />
that they felt the location was “no better or worse than other areas.”<br />
239, preferred an expressway location while 20% did not like the express-<br />
way location. The remaining 9% had a mixed reaction.<br /><br />
Additional evidence along the same line is available in current resi-<br />
dential development along the County Beltway. In the general vicinity of<br />
Towson a substantial number of houses have been built and sold on land<br />
adjoining the Beltway. Apparently the purchasers did not regard the<br />
proximity of the Beltway as being objectionable.<br /><br />
As a generality it can be said that an expressway will have an adverse<br />
effect upon adjacent properties in any case where the expressway is less<br />
attractive or less desirable than the use which it replaces and that, con-<br />
versely, an expressway may have a beneficial effect when the opposite is<br />
the case. Thus, almost any kind of expressway adjacent to a high-grade<br />
residential area will act, at least to some extent, to depress abutting<br /><br />
27<br /><br />
properties. The one possible exception would be an expressway with a<br />
very wide right of way which was extensively landscaped—similar, for<br />
example, to the Westchester County Parkways. On the other hand, a<br />
depressed expressway running between parallel streets through a blighted<br />
residential area might have a beneficial effect on adjacent properties. Or<br />
again, an elevated expressway between parallel streets in a blighted com-<br />
mercial area with ample space between the structure and nearby buildings<br />
might very well have a helpful effect. Determining whether an expressway<br />
will be a desirable or undesirable neighbor is thus a relative matter. It<br />
depends upon the character of the expressway, the quality of the adjacent<br />
properties, and the nature of the buildings or uses removed to make way<br />
for the expressway.<br /><br />
And finally, it should be noted that with respect to elevated express-<br />
ways a great deal depends upon the quality of design. At their worst<br />
elevated expressways can be heavy, oppressive, and downright ugly. By<br />
comparison a well designed expressway structure can appear relatively<br />
light and graceful.<br /><br />
Expressways Provide Incidental Advantages<br /><br />
Expressways frequently provide the opportunity to take advantage<br />
of certain incidental benefits or by-products. The more important of<br />
these include:<br /><br />
1. An elevated expressway not running along an existing street often<br />
provides an opportunity to make use of the cleared land adjacent<br />
to or underneath the structure. Landscaping and off-street park-<br />
ing are two obvious possibilities.<br /><br />
2. An expressway, whether depressed or elevated, running in land<br />
which has been cleared between two parallel streets creates an<br />

3. Automobile driving along regular city streets is usually a rather<br />
dreary and dismal experience. Driving on urban expressways is<br />
often stimulating and even exciting. Not only is there the<br /><br />
“ pleasure of being able to proceed continuously and at good speeds<br />
through highly congested areas, but also expressways sometimes<br />
can provide the opportunity for interesting and even spectacular<br />
views of the city. The expressway running along the west side of<br />
Manhattan Island in- New York City is a good example. At the<br />
upper end are magnificent vistas of the Hudson River and the<br />
Palisades on the opposite shore. Further down are intimate<br />
close-ups of the great trans-Atlantic liners as well as views of the<br />
skyscraper concentrations at midtown and on lower Manhattan<br />
Island. Here in Baltimore the approaches to the Harbor Tunnel<br />
afford new and unusual vantage points from which to see the<br /><br />
 harbor and the center of the City. Expressway driving in many<br /><br />
""\cases can be an exhilarating experience.<br /><br />
Costs<br /><br />
There are wide variations in expressway costs. One of the most<br />
expensive was the Central Artery in Boston which cost about $36,000,000<br />
per mile. About one-quarter of this cost was for right of way. At the<br />
other end of the scale is the Cabrillo Freeway in San Diego which was<br />
completed in 1949 at an average cost of $768,000 per mile. In this case<br />
right of way costs were negligible.<br /><br />
A short elevated expressway close to the central business district of<br />
San Francisco ran $16,000,000 per mile, while in Chicago the eight-mile<br />
depressed Congress Street expressway was built for about $12,500,000<br />
per mile.<br /><br />
In view of the great variations in expressway costs it is not possible<br />
to generalize beyond noting that any expressway through developed urban<br />
areas will be expensive.<br /><br />
A certain amount of research has been done to demonstrate that<br />
expressways produce sufficient savings to justify their initial costs. For<br />

3. Automobile driving along regular city streets is usually a rather<br />
dreary and dismal experience. Driving on urban expressways is<br />
often stimulating and even exciting. Not only is there the<br />
<br />
“ pleasure of being able to proceed continuously and at good speeds<br />
through highly congested areas, but also expressways sometimes<br />
can provide the opportunity for interesting and even spectacular<br />
views of the city. The expressway running along the west side of<br />
Manhattan Island in- New York City is a good example. At the<br />
upper end are magnificent vistas of the Hudson River and the<br />
Palisades on the opposite shore. Further down are intimate<br />
close-ups of the great trans-Atlantic liners as well as views of the<br />
skyscraper concentrations at midtown and on lower Manhattan<br />
Island. Here in Baltimore the approaches to the Harbor Tunnel<br />
afford new and unusual vantage points from which to see the<br />
<br />
 harbor and the center of the City. Expressway driving in many<br />
<br />
""\cases can be an exhilarating experience.<br />
<br />
Costs<br />
<br />
There are wide variations in expressway costs. One of the most<br />
expensive was the Central Artery in Boston which cost about $36,000,000<br />
per mile. About one-quarter of this cost was for right of way. At the<br />
other end of the scale is the Cabrillo Freeway in San Diego which was<br />
completed in 1949 at an average cost of $768,000 per mile. In this case<br />
right of way costs were negligible.<br />
<br />
A short elevated expressway close to the central business district of<br />
San Francisco ran $16,000,000 per mile, while in Chicago the eight-mile<br />
depressed Congress Street expressway was built for about $12,500,000<br />
per mile.<br />
<br />
In view of the great variations in expressway costs it is not possible<br />
to generalize beyond noting that any expressway through developed urban<br />
areas will be expensive.<br />
<br />
A certain amount of research has been done to demonstrate that<br />
expressways produce sufficient savings to justify their initial costs. For<br />
example, according to studies conducted in Los Angeles, the average saving<br />
from expressway use came to 2.0 cents per vehicle mile, computed as<br />
follows:<br />
<br />

Furthermore, insofar as savings exist they may be taken by many<br />
persons in some form other than cash. People may take advantage of an<br />
expressway to move further out of town so as to secure more space. For<br />
such individuals total travel costs may not diminish even though cost per<br />
mile has been reduced. To the extent that expressways result in thinning<br />
out the metropolitan area, the owner of a truck fleet serving the area<br />
may also find that at least some of his potential savings have been eaten<br />
up by the need to cover greater distances.<br /><br />
The savings quoted above do provide ammunition for those who<br />
believe that expressways should be financed by taxes assessed specifically<br />
against automobile users—gas taxes, tire taxes, etc. They also justify the<br />
construction of expressways in terms of the net effect on the total resources<br />
of our economy. They can be used to demonstrate that the necessary<br />
expenditure of manpower, capital, and materials is warranted.<br /><br />
All of this, however, presupposes a rational approach to public and<br />
private automobile expenditures which does not, in fact, exist. We spend<br />

Potential operating savings are an important factor in the overall<br />
picture, but they should be kept in perspective. We should ask ourselves<br />
first, what is the minimum level of highway service which we wish to<br />
achieve and, second, what is the best method of achieving this goal taking<br />
all factors into account—initial cost, operating cost, number of properties<br />
to be razed, number of families to be displaced, effect on taxes, effect<br />
on the economic base of the City, effect on the central business district,<br /><br />

Expressway Systems in Large Cities<br /><br />
This Chapter so far has dealt with the characteristics of a single<br />
expressway. No large city can, however, rely on one expressway to handle<br />
its traffic problem, and the relationship of an expressway to other possible<br />
expressways and to the entire pattern of arterial highways within the<br />
city is a matter of importance.<br /><br />
The most authoritative document on the design of expressways is the<br />
publication of the American Association of State Highway Officials en-<br />
titled A Policy on Arterial Highways in Urban Areas. (The recommended<br />
design standards set forth therein serve as the basis for minimum Federal<br />
requirements for the Interstate Highway System.) This document dis-<br />
cusses the type of highway system needed for a large city in these terms:<br />
“ ... the basic pattern of arterial highways is in the form of a wheel.<br />
Radial routes are the spokes; the outer circumferential or belt highway<br />
is the rim, and the inner belt around the central business district is the<br />
hub; large cities also may have an intermediate belt. Local conditions<br />
may distort the symmetry of the wheel pattern and even eliminate parts<br />
of it, but in general the overall pattern is much the same for all cities . . . .<br />
The type of highway-freeway, at-grade expressway, or major street—to<br />
be used in the arterial highway pattern is determined by joint consider-<br />
ation of the type of facility needed to carry the traffic load and that<br />
physically and economically is feasible in that part of the city. The larger<br />
the urban area, the greater is the necessity for high-type facilities. In a<br />
typical large city (500,000 - 1,000,000) the framework of the arterial<br />
system consists of several expressway or freeway radial routes and two<br />
or more belts. Major streets complete the system.”<br /><br /><br />"," <br />

The Pros and Cons of Expressways<br /><br /><br /><br />
Expressways in Relation to the Central Business District'<br /><br />
A residential suburb in Baltimore is not, by itself, very different from<br />
a residential area in a smaller community. What distinguishes the Balti-<br />
more suburb is the proximity of the downtown area and the corresponding<br />
availability of all of the functions and services that customarily are located<br />
there. It is in the center of our City that we find the large central<br />
department stores, the small speciality shops, the theaters and amusement<br />
centers, the hotels and restaurants, and the headquarters for much of our<br />
cultural life. Here also is the center of the area’s economic activity, the<br />
large offices, the important financial institutions, and the major concen-<br />
tration of professional activities.<br /><br />
It is, of course, well known that our central business district has been<br />
declining in importance as the rest of the metropolitan area grows. The<br />
evidences of this decline have been too well established to warrant repeti-<br />
tion here. It is pertinent to point out, however, that a continued decline<br />
will represent something more than just a transfer of downtown functions<br />
to more outlying areas. If the process continues some activities which<br />
can only be supported on an area-wide basis will be wholly lost. A large<br />
department store can establish suburban branches and perhaps end by<br />
closing entirely its central store, as did Wanamakers in New York. Inade-<br />
quate support for our one legitimate theater, however, cannot be remedied<br />
by setting up a branch Ford’s in Towson and another in Glen Burnie.<br /><br />
Do we want a dispersed metropolitan area with some of our present<br />
downtown functions abandoned and others distributed over a large area<br />
so that we end up with a kind of homogenized city? Or do we want a<br />
metropolitan area with a strong focal point and a vigorous, active center?<br />
The business leadership of the community and the City Administration<br />
have already decided in favor of a strong city center and the one-sided<br />
vote in favor of Charles Center is ample evidence that this decision has<br />
the support of the citizens.<br /><br />
30<br /><br />
The link between a strong central business district and the express-<br /><br />
way program is the question of accessibility. For Baltimore, as for any<br />
other large city, the dominant characteristic of the central business dis-<br />
trict is that it occupies the location having maximum accessibility from all<br />
parts of the metropolitan area. Accessibility is, however, a relative matter.<br />
If, as the metropolitan area grows, congestion increases so that it is more<br />
difficult to reach the central business district, but if, at the same time,<br />
congestion slows down other movements within the area to an equivalent<br />
degree, the central business district will retain its relative accessibility<br />
and its essential strength. On the other hand, if there are major highway<br />
improvements in the outer sections of the area not matched by improve-<br />
ments leading to the center of the city, the relative accessibility of the<br />
central business district will be reduced and the central business district<br />
will decline.<br /><br />
This point can be illustrated by some schematic examples. Assume<br />
that the circle in Figure 2(a) represents a metropolitan area 10 miles in<br />
radius with a normal pattern of surface streets. Assume also that<br />
vehicular travel within one mile of the center averages 10 miles per hour<br />
but that elsewhere it can proceed at 20 miles per hour. Let us also assume<br />
that the point marked A is 8 miles due north of the center of the area<br />
and that the point marked B is 8 miles due south. Based on these assump-<br />
tions it can be demonstrated that all of the area shaded in the upper part<br />
of the circle is more accessible to A than to the center. In other words,<br />
a trip to any point in the shaded area can be done in shorter time starting<br />
from A than starting from the center. The shaded portion represents 30%<br />
of the metropolitan area. The balance, 70%, is more accessible to the<br /><br /><br /><br />
1The commonly accepted definition of the Central Business District has the<br />
following approximate boundaries: Pratt Street on the south, Greene Street on the<br />
west, Centre Street on the north, and the Fallsway on the east. The Central Business<br />

other similar outlying point) of better than 2 to 1. It is obvious that the<br />
center’s margin of superiority over A is increased the farther one gets<br />
from A. It would take 27 minutes to drive from the center to Point B;<br />
54 minutes to drive from A to B.<br /><br />
Now let us change the circumstances somewhat. Let us assume that<br />
an expressway in the form of a beltway is built around the city 8 miles<br />
from the center. Let us also assume that one can travel on this beltway<br />
at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. The area now more accessible<br />
to A than to the center will increase, as shown in Fig. 2(b), to the point<br />
where it equals 50% of the metropolitan area. A, instead of being less<br />
than half as accessible as the center, is now just as accessible. Further-<br />
more, even within the area in which it still is dominant the center’s<br />
margin of superiority over A is markedly less. It still takes 27 minutes to<br />
travel from the center to B, but the travel time from A to B has dropped<br />
from 54 minutes to 37 minutes. The previous 27 minutes differential has<br />
thus been reduced to 10, a drop of almost 2/3.<br /><br />
Next, let us assume that in addition to the beltway a radial express-<br />
way (allowing an average speed of 40 miles per hour) is built from the<br />
center of the City due north to the limits of the metropolitan area. This<br />
example is illustrated in Fig. 2(c). While the center has improved its<br />
position somewhat in relationship to points on the east and west sides of<br />
the beltway, fundamentally the situation is still the same as shown in<br />
Fig. 2(b).<br /><br />
Finally, let us assume that three additional radial expressways are<br />
constructed running from the center to the edge of the metropolitan area:<br />
one to the east, one to the south, and one to the west. This condition is<br />
illustrated in Fig. 2(d). Under these circumstances the center again has a<br />
better than two to one superiority over point A or any similarly situated<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

although the margin of superiority over Fig. 2(a) is slight.<br /><br />
The application of these theoretical examples to the Baltimore area<br />
is, of course, obvious if one regards the beltway as being the Beltway now<br />
partially completed in the County, the single expressway to the north as<br />
the Jones Falls Expressway, and the three additional radials as the<br />
Southwest Expressway and the East-West Expressway.<br /><br />
These examples would seem to suggest that from the standpoint of<br />
saving the central business district the real villain of the piece is the<br />
Beltway. If this conclusion seems farfetched one has only to consider the<br />
array of major shopping centers which are springing up at strategic points<br />
along the Beltway or in close proximity to the Beltway. Included in this<br />
list are Towson Plaza, Eastpoint, Harundale Mall, and Westview. Or<br />
again, consider the new headquarters of the Department of Motor Vehicles<br />
on Ritchie Highway. The State’s principal justification for picking this<br />
site rather than one close to the center of Baltimore was its proximity to<br />
the planned route of the Beltway.<br /><br />
The above schematic examples may also cast some additional light<br />
on the question of substituting improved mass transit for expressways.<br />
The health of the central business district is dependent upon superior<br />
accessibility for all types of transportation. It has been indicated that it<br />
requires four expressways extending outwards from the center at roughly<br />
right angles, one to the other, to remedy the loss of vehicular accessibility<br /><br />
/resultmg from the construction of a beltway. Without this minimum<br />
framework of expressways no amount of public transit improvement can<br />
restore the central business district’s position of maximum accessibility<br />
from all part of the metropolitan area. It may be the most accessible spot<br />
from the standpoint of public transportation, but with the beltway and<br />
without the radials it will no longer be the most accessible for automo-<br /><br />
bile travel.<br /><br />
The central business district’s position within the metropolitan area<br />
is, of course, dependent upon many factors besides highways. Construc-<br />
tion of the expressway pattern outlined in this report will not by itself<br />
insure the future security of the central business district. It can safely<br />
be said, however, that failure to continue with an expressway program<br />
clearly focused on the downtown area will gravely jeopardize the many<br />
efforts now being made to save the central business district. If we call a<br />
halt after completion of the Jones Falls Expressway we face the prospect<br />
of living in a city much more dispersed and scattered than our present<br />
city. It will be more a large urban area than a city—one that will lack<br />
much of the character and identity of Baltimore as we now know it.<br /><br />
Alternatives to Expressways<br /><br />
It is not hard to develop a case against urban expressways. We can<br />
tell ourselves that the construction of expressways produces too great an<br />
upheaval, that the hardships and other problems resulting from the relo-<br />
cation of a good many thousands of people are excessive, that too much<br />
property must be destroyed, and that the loss in tax base will be burden-<br />
some. We can say that we should not be seduced by the availability of<br />
large Federal grants and that we should be able to resist what might be<br />
called the expressway hysteria allegedly affecting many other cities. We<br />
can point to the fact that other metropolitan areas have already reached<br />
the size which we expect to attain in the next twenty to thirty years and<br />
that they did so without reliance on urban expressways. We can tell<br />
ourselves that there are more things in life than the automobile and that<br />

The Pros and Cons of Expressways<br /><br /><br /><br />
pressways have drawbacks as well as virtues. This being the case, one<br />
possibility which should be examined would be a complete abandonment<br />
_ of future expressway plans. What might the future hold if we did not<br />
construct any more expressways after the Jones Falls Expressway? Or,<br />
more specifically, what would happen if Baltimore decided not to go<br />
ahead with the East-West Expressway?<br /><br />
We could, first of all, endeavor to increase the present capacity of<br />
east-west streets by new streets or by widening existing streets. Previous<br />
sections of this report have. indicated that all of the capacity of the<br />
East-West Expressway would be needed to handle anticipated traffic<br />
growth and to provide some small relief to existing streets. Since one<br />
expressway lane is roughly the equivalent of two and one-half surface<br />
street lanes it would require twenty new lanes of surface streets to equal<br />
the eight lanes planned for the East-West Expressway. These 20 lanes<br />
would have to pass from one side of the City to the other and all, or<br />
nearly all, should cross the center of the City between the Inner Harbor<br />
on the south and about Cold Spring Lane on the north.<br /><br />
It would not be possible to widen existing streets or to create new<br />
ones without tearing down buildings. Removing all of the buildings on<br />
one side of a street would probably permit an average of four additional<br />
lanes to be constructed. Twenty lanes would require the razing of all<br />
buildings on one side of each of five streets. Regardless of where located,<br />
the East-West Expressway will require the razing of buildings on one side<br />
of each of two streets (e.g., the south side of Franklin and the north side<br />
of Mulberry).<br /><br />
Twenty additional lanes of surface streets would thus require the<br />
removal of approximately two and one-half times as many buildings as<br />
would the East-West Expressway. The number of families to be relocated,<br />
the loss in taxes, and the cost of site acquisition would be in proportion.<br /><br />
33<br /><br />
Construction cost would be considerably less and, as a result, total cost<br />
might perhaps be less. A program of creating 20 new surface street lanes<br />
would not, however, generate any new Federal grants and the total cost<br />
to the City would thus be very much greater than the cost to the City<br />
for the East-West Expressway after making allowance for the very sub-<br />
stantial Federal grants available for this purpose.<br /><br />
Furthermore, while 20 new surface street lanes would duplicate the<br />
capacity of the East-West Expressway they would not provide the safety<br />
or the savings in travel time of the East-West Expressway.<br /><br />
It seems evident that if the City is not willing to go ahead with an<br />
East-West Expressway it would be even less likely to proceed with a pro-<br />
gram which would provide the same capacity by additional surface streets.<br /><br />
What happens, then, if we neither build additional expressways nor<br />
add substantially to our present surface street capacity? Here one has<br />
to do some guessing, but the following results seem probable.<br /><br />
In the first place, while Mr. Barnes has accomplished remarkable<br />
results in squeezing additional capacity out of our existing street system,<br />
there are obviously limits to what can be achieved in this way and Mr.<br />
Barnes would probably be the first to admit that we are approaching<br />
these limits. From here on in, if we do not add substantially to our high-<br />
way system, congestion will steadily increase. It would seem possible to<br />
project present trends into the future to the point where congestion had<br />
become so great that traffic movement was theoretically impossible. This,<br />
however, is an unlikely result. At some point this side of complete stag-<br />
nation certain counter forces and trends would probably come into play.<br /><br />
People trapped by congestion are also citizens and voters. The need<br />
for relief would almost certainly become a major political issue which<br />
would have to be recognized by future City administrations. Since we are<br />

The Pros and Cons of Expressways<br /><br /><br /><br />
program as the construction of expressways, the likely result would be a<br />
series of remedial measures on a piecemeal basis to relieve points of ex-<br />
treme congestion—a street widening here, a grade separation there, etc.<br /><br />
In addition to these relatively small-scale improvements there would<br />
probably also develop over a period of years a gradual series of changes in<br />
the metropolitan area representing a multitude of individual adjustments<br />
to the level of congestion. There would almost certainly be a speed-up in<br />
the decentralization of downtown firms and activities and a continued<br />
or accelerated, decline in the.central business district. Outlying shopping<br />
centers would tend not only to serve the shopping needs of surrounding<br />
areas but would more and more take on many of the functions which<br />
previously were best handled by the central business district.<br /><br />
Workers would tend to adjust either their jobs or their homes so that<br />
the two would be in closer proximity. It might be said, from a planning<br />
point of view, that this is a desirable result and so it would be if it came<br />
about through free choice. When, however, it is forced by congestion it<br />
normally means that the worker, restricted in his choice of job or home<br />
site, will end up with a less desirable job or home, or both. At the same<br />
time employers will find that they are able to draw from a smaller and<br />
smaller labor market.<br /><br />
With the Baltimore region tending to become a series of urbanized<br />

will be that economic growth will proceed at a slower rate than antici-<br />
pated. With a high level of congestion in the Baltimore metropolitan<br />
area some firms that otherwise might move here from elsewhere will not<br />
do so. Others now here may move entirely outside of the Baltimore area.<br />

mobility, less freedom to select jobs or home sites, a speed-up in decen-<br />

The Pros and Cons of Expressways<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
program as the construction of expressways, the likely result would be a<br />
series of remedial measures on a piecemeal basis to relieve points of ex-<br />
treme congestion—a street widening here, a grade separation there, etc.<br />
<br />
In addition to these relatively small-scale improvements there would<br />
probably also develop over a period of years a gradual series of changes in<br />
the metropolitan area representing a multitude of individual adjustments<br />
to the level of congestion. There would almost certainly be a speed-up in<br />
the decentralization of downtown firms and activities and a continued<br />
or accelerated, decline in the.central business district. Outlying shopping<br />
centers would tend not only to serve the shopping needs of surrounding<br />
areas but would more and more take on many of the functions which<br />
previously were best handled by the central business district.<br />
<br />
Workers would tend to adjust either their jobs or their homes so that<br />
the two would be in closer proximity. It might be said, from a planning<br />
point of view, that this is a desirable result and so it would be if it came<br />
about through free choice. When, however, it is forced by congestion it<br />
normally means that the worker, restricted in his choice of job or home<br />
site, will end up with a less desirable job or home, or both. At the same<br />
time employers will find that they are able to draw from a smaller and<br />
smaller labor market.<br />
<br />
With the Baltimore region tending to become a series of urbanized<br />
sections rather than a unified city, many functions which can only be<br />
supported on a metropolitan area basis will find survival difficult if not<br />
impossible. The smaller specialized shops and services, the theater, con-<br />
certs, museums and similar activities will occupy a smaller and smaller<br />
place in the life of the community. People, finding it difficult to con-<br />
gregate in a central place, will fairly quickly lose the habit of making an<br />

Vi. REQUIREMENTS AND CRITERIA FOR AN<br />
EAST-WEST EXPRESSWAY<br /><br />
Any route for an East-West Expressway should satisfy the following<br /><br />
requirements:<br /><br />
1. It should be planned in such a way that it will be approvable for<br />
inclusion in the National Interstate Highway System and thus be<br />
eligible for 90% Federal grant. Specifically this means that:<br />
(a) At its eastern termination it must connect with the proposed<br /><br />
North-East Expressway leading to Philadelphia.<br /><br />
(b) At its western termination it must cross the city line at about<br />
Cooks Lane so as to connect with the proposed freeway<br />
going toward Frederick.<br /><br />
(c) It must be possible to meet Federal design standards.<br />
2. A feasible interchange with the Jones Falls Expressway must be<br />
possible.<br />
3. It should provide good service to the central business district.<br />
If more than one route can be developed meeting the above require-<br />
ments, then judgment as to the relative desirability of the different routes<br />
should be based upon the following factors:<br />
1. Benefits to traffic.<br />
(a) Extent to which route conforms to traffic desire lines.<br />
(b) Extent of relief to presently congested streets.<br /><br />
(c) Extent to which incidental benefits (street widenings, etc.)<br />
are made possible.<br /><br />
35<br /><br />
2. Stimulus to new building or to redevelopment in adjacent areas.<br />
3. Benefit to the central business district including the retail trade<br />
center, Charles Center, and the Civic Center.<br />
4. Benefits to the economic life of the City—commerce, industry,<br />
port, etc.<br />
5. Blighting effect as measured by:<br />
(a) Extent to which route splits established residential neighbor-<br />
hoods.<br />
(b) Extent to which route separates areas which for economic<br />
reasons should be in close proximity.<br />
(¢) Proximity to high grade residential areas.<br />
(d) Proximity of elevated structures to any residential areas.<br />
(e) Close proximity of elevated structures to retail or office use.<br />
Quantity and quality of dwellings to be demolished.<br /><br />
Effect on assessed valuations.<br /><br />
Total cost.<br /><br />
Significant or important properties to be taken:<br /><br />
(a) Churches<br /><br />
(b) Moderately large or large structures not in poor condition.<br /><br />
(c) Takings which would utilize significant amounts of vacant<br />
land otherwise desirable and available for industrial ex-<br />
pansion.<br /><br />

the East-West Expressway is that contained in the 1957 Plan. The com-<br />

has subsequently informally agreed that if this alignment is to be used<br />

was studied in detail. These two variations are discussed below:<br /><br />
1. The Hoffman Street Alternate<br /><br />
After crossing the Jones Falls Expressway in an easterly<br />

reaches the blocks between Preston and Hoffman Streets. At<br />
this point it becomes depressed and proceeds between these two<br />
streets to Bond Street. All of the existing improvements between<br />
Hoffman and Preston Streets would be taken. The pattern for<br /><br />

this stretch of the Expressway is thus much like that between<br />
Mulberry and Franklin Streets west of Fremont Avenue.<br /><br />
The Pennsylvania Railroad tunnel passes under Hoffman<br />
Street and also under the land just to the south of Hoffman<br />
Street. As a result the land to the south of Hoffman Street is<br />
already cleared of improvements for an average width of about<br />
65 feet. If the bed of Hoffman Street is included there is a<br />
cleared strip of approximately 120 feet.<br /><br />
Certain neighborhood interests which have been opposed to<br />
the East-West Expressway, primarily on the basis of the number<br />
of buildings to be taken, indicated that their opposition would<br />
diminish or disappear if the Expressway could be moved over into<br />
this cleared strip. Since the Pennsylvania Railroad tunnel passes<br />
underneath, the Expressway in this location would have to be<br />
elevated. The results of this small northerly shift in the align-<br />
ment are shown on Sheet 21.<br /><br />
From the standpoint of alignment, grades, ease of access, and<br />
traffic handling ability this possible revision is at least as good as<br />
the original route. It is an improvement over the original route<br />
in the number of houses to be taken. Approximately 380 resi-<br />
dential buildings and 40 other buildings which would have to be<br />
demolished under the original scheme would not have to be taken<br />

possible adverse effect upon abutting properties. In lieu of this<br />
arrangement the Hoffman Street alternate would provide an<br />
elevated structure which for six blocks would be in close proximity<br />
to existing residential structures. The net effect of the Hoffman<br />
Street alternate on the adjacent neighborhood would certainly be<br />
more detrimental than the original plan.<br /><br />
Taking all these factors into consideration it seems clear that<br />
the Hoffman Street alternate is less desirable than the original<br />
plan and should not be adopted. Our conclusions on this score<br />
are not altered by the fact that there is some indication that<br />
adoption of the Hoffman Street alternate might reduce opposition<br />
to the Northern Route.<br /><br />
. Northern Mt. Vernon Alternate<br /><br />
One of the principal objections to the Northern Route has<br />
been based on the quality of the buildings in or adjacent to the<br />
right of way through the Mt. Vernon area. A further objection<br />
has been based on the extent to which the proposed route splits<br />
the Mt. Vernon area in two. It has been suggested that some of<br />
these objections might be overcome if this portion of the Express-<br />
way could be shifted a few blocks to the north where it would be<br />
closer to the northern limits of the Mt. Vernon area and where<br />
existing improvements are somewhat less desirable. Under this<br />
proposal the intersection of the Northern Route and the Jones<br />
Falls Expressway would be moved approximately three blocks<br />
northward so that the crossing would occur at about the point<br />
where Guilford Avenue will cross the Jones Falls Expressway.<br />
From this intersection the Expressway would go directly east on<br />
an elevated structure so as to meet the original route on the other<br />
side of Greenmount Avenue between Preston Street and Hoffman<br />
Street. Proceeding westerly from the Jones Falls Expressway<br />
the proposal would call for the East-West Route to pass over<br /><br />
Mt. Royal Avenue to Calvert Street. It would then turn south-<br />
westerly passing diagonally through the present street pattern to<br />
Cathedral Street. Continuing in the same direction it would join<br />
the original route at about Howard Street. The alignment of this<br />
alternate is indicated by the heavy line on Sheet 22.<br /><br />
While this proposal could be made to work, it has certain<br /><br />
undesirable features:<br /><br />
(a) It would be impossible to depress the Expressway at any<br />
point between Greenmount Avenue and Fremont Ave-<br />
nue. It would thus pass through the center of town as<br />
an elevated structure.<br /><br />
(b) The only type of interchange which could be devised<br />
with the Jones Falls Expressway would be awkward and<br />
cumbersome.<br /><br />
(c) While it is true that the structures in the northern part<br />
of the Mt. Royal area through which this proposed<br />
revision would pass are somewhat lower in quality than<br />
those between Chase and Eager Streets, nevertheless, the<br />
fact that the revised route would pass diagonally through<br />
this section would result in some highly undesirable<br />
taking lines. The scars left by this routing would be<br />
more damaging than those for the 1957 Plan.<br /><br />
For all of these reasons no more detailed consideration was<br /><br />
given to this proposal.<br /><br />
This phase of our study led to the conclusion that no small-scale<br />
improvements of the Northern Route could be made. If the East-West<br />
Expressway is to be located along this route the present alignment seems<br />
to be the best possible. This conclusion is not surprising when it is con-<br />
sidered that the present path is the result of several years of study on the<br />
part of the Planning Commission.<br />"," <br />

the Mt. Vernon area in two. It has been suggested that some of<br />
these objections might be overcome if this portion of the Express-<br />
way could be shifted a few blocks to the north where it would be<br />
closer to the northern limits of the Mt. Vernon area and where<br />
existing improvements are somewhat less desirable. Under this<br />
proposal the intersection of the Northern Route and the Jones<br />
Falls Expressway would be moved approximately three blocks<br />
northward so that the crossing would occur at about the point<br />
where Guilford Avenue will cross the Jones Falls Expressway.<br />
From this intersection the Expressway would go directly east on<br />
an elevated structure so as to meet the original route on the other<br />
side of Greenmount Avenue between Preston Street and Hoffman<br />
Street. Proceeding westerly from the Jones Falls Expressway<br />
the proposal would call for the East-West Route to pass over<br />
<br />
Mt. Royal Avenue to Calvert Street. It would then turn south-<br />
westerly passing diagonally through the present street pattern to<br />
Cathedral Street. Continuing in the same direction it would join<br />
the original route at about Howard Street. The alignment of this<br />
alternate is indicated by the heavy line on Sheet 22.<br />
<br />
While this proposal could be made to work, it has certain<br />
<br />
undesirable features:<br />
<br />
(a) It would be impossible to depress the Expressway at any<br />
point between Greenmount Avenue and Fremont Ave-<br />
nue. It would thus pass through the center of town as<br />
an elevated structure.<br />
<br />
(b) The only type of interchange which could be devised<br />
with the Jones Falls Expressway would be awkward and<br />
cumbersome.<br />
<br />
(c) While it is true that the structures in the northern part<br />
of the Mt. Royal area through which this proposed<br />
revision would pass are somewhat lower in quality than<br />
those between Chase and Eager Streets, nevertheless, the<br />
fact that the revised route would pass diagonally through<br />
this section would result in some highly undesirable<br />
taking lines. The scars left by this routing would be<br />
more damaging than those for the 1957 Plan.<br />
<br />
For all of these reasons no more detailed consideration was<br />
<br />
given to this proposal.<br />
<br />
This phase of our study led to the conclusion that no small-scale<br />
improvements of the Northern Route could be made. If the East-West<br />
Expressway is to be located along this route the present alignment seems<br />
to be the best possible. This conclusion is not surprising when it is con-<br />
sidered that the present path is the result of several years of study on the<br />
part of the Planning Commission.<br />

vill. HARBOR ROUTE AND RELATED<br /><br />
PROPOSALS<br /><br />
After studying the Northern Route to determine if improvements<br />
could be made in its alignment, attention was next directed to the location<br />
of substantially different routes.<br /><br />
It will be recalled that Chapter VI of this report sets forth three<br />
basic requirements which should be met by any route for an East-West<br />
Expressway. These requirements were: First, it should be approvable for<br />
inclusion in the National Interstate Highway System; second, interchange<br />
with the Jones Falls Expressway must be feasible; and third, good service<br />
must be provided to the central business district.<br /><br />
Only one new route was discovered which met all of these require-<br />
ments satisfactorily. This route is referred to in this report as the Harbor<br />
Route. The complete route is shown on Sheet 7. The detailed alignment<br />
is set forth on Sheets 8 through 12 and 23 through 28.<br /><br />
From the western City line to Myrtle Avenue the Harbor Route is<br />
identical to the Northern Route. For the following reasons it was decided<br />
to make no change in this section:<br /><br />
1. The crossing of the western City boundary is in effect fixed if the<br />
East-West Expressway is to be eligible for inclusion as part of the<br />
Interstate Highway System.<br /><br />
2. From the western City boundary to Hilton Street the route passes<br />
through Leakin Park and Gwynns Falls Park. While it would<br />
normally be undesirable to use park land for highway purposes,<br />
the City owns a very large amount of park land in this general<br />
area and those portions needed for the Expressway would, for the<br />
most part, be located in the high isolated rugged areas south of<br />
Dead Run. In effect, the Expressway path jumps from hill to<br />
hill and approximately one-third of the total length within the<br />
park would be elevated. There would be no interference between<br />
the Expressway and any developed sections of the park, nor would<br /><br />
38<br /><br />
there be any conflict with present foot or vehicle circulation<br />
within the park. Most present entrance roads into the City are<br />
unsightly; this one would have great beauty. Total park land<br />
required would be about 85 acres, of which about 35 would be<br />
needed for the Hilton Street interchange. This reduction in park<br />
acreage can be replaced in whole or in part by the purchase of<br />
additional vacant land adjacent to the park. Already two parcels<br />
at the western end of Leakin Park have been acquired to prevent<br />
development in the path of the Expressway. When the Express-<br />
way requirements have been met there will remain about 25 acres<br />
in these two parcels which can easily be added to the Park. The<br />
only alternative to the use of park land at this point would be<br />
to run the Expressway through the high-grade residential areas<br />
to the north or to the south.<br /><br />
. The stretch running between Mulberry and Franklin Streets from<br /><br />
the Pennsylvania Railroad on the west to Myrtle Avenue on the<br />
east (a little less than a mile and one-half) has long been ear-<br />
marked for clearance for highway purposes and much planning<br />
during the past ten years has been based on the understanding<br />
that an expressway would be located here. Two public housing<br />
projects located just to the east of Fremont Avenue have been<br />
developed with this Expressway in mind, and the plan for the<br />
Harlem Park Urban Renewal Area has been predicated on this<br />
assumption. The heavy streams of traffic which now flow on<br />
Mulberry and Franklin Streets have made the area between these<br />
two streets highly undesirable for residential purposes and many,<br />
if not most, of the structures between these two streets are so<br />
dilapidated that they should be torn down. With or without the<br />
Expressway, Franklin and Mulberry Streets will continue to be<br /><br /><br />","BE'R'R'E'R'EER'E'E'EER<br />

the east provides the closest possible access to many portions of<br />
the central business district, including particularly the retail trade<br />
center surrounding the intersection of Howard and Lexington<br />
Streets.<br /><br />
At Myrtle Avenue the Harbor Route deviates from the Northern<br />
Route. It turns south and continues in this direction as a depressed route<br />
to Pratt Street, running first between Myrtle Avenue and Pine Street and<br />
then skirting the western boundary of the University of Maryland Re-<br />
newal Area.<br /><br />
At the lower end of this southerly stretch the proposed route is occu-<br />
pied by St. Paul’s Cemetery which lies between Redwood and Lombard<br />
Streets just east of Fremont Avenue. This cemetery dates back to 1800<br />
and contains the graves of a number of noted men. It would be desirable<br />
to avoid this cemetery, but it does not appear possible to do so. Moving<br />
the Expressway to the east would conflict with the University of Maryland<br />
and University Hospital. A relocation to the west would increase sub-<br />
stantially the number and quality of houses to be razed, would eliminate<br />
the possibility of creating an inner ring around the downtown area, and<br />
would destroy any useful relationship between the expressway system and<br />
the retail trade center.<br /><br />
Several solutions to this situation are possible. If St. Paul’s Church<br />
agreed, the Expressway, depressed at this point, could be tunneled far<br /><br />
39<br /><br />
enough below the Cemetery so as not to disturb the graves. Or possibly<br />
the Church and the City might find it mutually advantageous to consider<br />
the removal of the cemetery to a wholly new site. The problem, which<br />
has evident emotional overtones, will have to be worked out in conjunction<br />
with the Church Vestry.<br /><br />
After passing under the Cemetery the Harbor Route swings around<br />
to the east and continues between Pratt and Camden Streets as far as<br />
Light Street. As it makes this turn from south to east it is also rising to<br />
an elevated structure so as to clear a very large sewer in Penn Street and<br />
the Baltimore and Ohio tunnel under Howard Street. (It continues as<br />
an elevated structure for the balance of the route primarily because it<br />
skirts the northern side of the Inner Harbor and in this location a de-<br />
pressed roadway would be below the water line.) Also, as the Harbor<br />
Route turns to the east connections are provided to Russell Street to the<br />
south so that there is easy access between the Harbor Route and the<br />
Washington-Baltimore Expressway.<br /><br />
As the Harbor Route proceeds between Pratt and Camden Streets it<br />
first passes along the southern boundary of the University of Maryland<br />
Renewal Area, thus serving as a buffer between the proposed University<br />
campus and the industrial area to the south. It then passes within one<br />
block of the Civic Center and Charles Center and access ramps are pro-<br />
vided which would serve both of these new developments. Renewal Area 7<br />
and the Camden B&amp;O Station lie immediately to the south of this stretch<br />
of the Expressway.<br /><br />
The clearance of the blocks between Pratt and Camden Streets pro-<br />
vides the opportunity, if desired, to widen both streets and to utilize the<br />
balance of the land for off-street parking, for landscaping, or for similar<br />
purposes. The cleared land on either side of the Expressway would furnish<br />

After crossing over Light Street the Harbor Route then continues as<br />
an elevated structure south of Pratt Street across the municipal piers.<br />
The piers could be continued in use for small boats or barges but it would<br />
probably be desirable to discontinue all such uses and to construct a new<br />
sea wall a short distance to the south of the Expressway. The ends of the<br />
piers could then be cut off and the space behind the sea wall filled in.<br />
Under this scheme the present buildings on the south side of Pratt Street<br />
housing the Port Authority and the Department of Transit and Traffic<br />
could be left. The Baltimore Gas and Electric Company’s heating plant<br />
on Pier No. 4 also could be left if necessary, although some special arrange-<br />
ment might have to be worked out if this plant continues to use barge-<br />
delivered coal.<br /><br />
If the areas between the piers and beneath the Expressway are filled<br />
in, Camden Street could, if desired, be extended to the east so as to con-<br />
nect up with Eastern Avenue thus providing an entirely new cross-town<br />
street. The balance of the land between the sea wall and Pratt Street<br />
could be used for a variety of purposes, such as off-street parking or a<br />
landscaped park.<br /><br />
Interchange with the Jones Falls Expressway would occur approxi-<br />
mately at Pier 6. The Jones Falls Expressway at this point must neces-<br />
sarily be a considerable distance in the air since it is about to bridge the<br />
Inner Harbor. There is thus room for the East-West Expressway to pass<br />
underneath and still be one level above grade. The plans show connections<br />
between the two Expressways which would permit all important movements.<br /><br />
An illustration of the section of the Harbor Route between Light<br />
Street and the Jones Falls Expressway treated as described above is<br />
presented as Sheet 29. This drawing also shows the relationship of the<br /><br />
40<br /><br />
Harbor Route to Charles Center and the Civic Center, as well as the<br />
interchange between the Harbor Route and the Jones Falls Expressway.<br /><br />
After passing under the Jones Falls Expressway the Harbor Route<br />
continues in a southeasterly direction passing over the President Street<br />
Station until it reaches Lancaster Street. At this point it turns due east<br />
and continues just south of Lancaster Street crossing by bridge the small<br />
portion of the Inner Harbor lying north of Anchorage No. 2.<br /><br />
While the bridge necessary to effect this water-crossing will be ex-<br />
pensive, it does not appear feasible to locate the route further north so<br />
that the water-crossing can be avoided. Immediately to the north of the<br />
proposed route is the large National Can Company plant. To the north<br />
of this plant lies a closely knit residential neighborhood which would be<br />
seriously harmed if the Expressway were to pass through it. The proposed<br />
bridge therefore appears to be essential.<br /><br />
After crossing the Harbor inlet the Harbor Route curves around to<br />
meet Boston Street and follows over Boston Street all the way to the<br />
entrance road to the Harbor Tunnel.<br /><br />
As the Harbor Route first swings into Boston Street it would be<br />
necessary to acquire all of the properties on the Harbor side of Boston<br />
Street between approximately Wagner Street and O’Donnell Street.<br />
There is only one good building in this stretch, however. Property acqui-<br />
sition between O’Donnell Street and the Esso Refinery would, for the<br />
most part, be minor in character and all would be on the northeastern<br />
side of Boston Street.<br /><br />
Because there are several tight places along the Boston Street route<br />
the Expressway would become a double-decked elevated structure at<br />
about the point it meets Boston Street and would continue in this<br />
fashion to the tunnel entrance road. A more detailed study needs to be<br />
made of the relation between the Harbor Route and the Esso Refinery.<br />","Toguir<br />

in, Camden Street could, if desired, be extended to the east so as to con-<br />
nect up with Eastern Avenue thus providing an entirely new cross-town<br />
street. The balance of the land between the sea wall and Pratt Street<br />
could be used for a variety of purposes, such as off-street parking or a<br />
landscaped park.<br />
<br />
Interchange with the Jones Falls Expressway would occur approxi-<br />
mately at Pier 6. The Jones Falls Expressway at this point must neces-<br />
sarily be a considerable distance in the air since it is about to bridge the<br />
Inner Harbor. There is thus room for the East-West Expressway to pass<br />
underneath and still be one level above grade. The plans show connections<br />
between the two Expressways which would permit all important movements.<br />
<br />
An illustration of the section of the Harbor Route between Light<br />
Street and the Jones Falls Expressway treated as described above is<br />
presented as Sheet 29. This drawing also shows the relationship of the<br />
<br />
40<br />
<br />
Harbor Route to Charles Center and the Civic Center, as well as the<br />
interchange between the Harbor Route and the Jones Falls Expressway.<br />
<br />
After passing under the Jones Falls Expressway the Harbor Route<br />
continues in a southeasterly direction passing over the President Street<br />
Station until it reaches Lancaster Street. At this point it turns due east<br />
and continues just south of Lancaster Street crossing by bridge the small<br />
portion of the Inner Harbor lying north of Anchorage No. 2.<br />
<br />
While the bridge necessary to effect this water-crossing will be ex-<br />
pensive, it does not appear feasible to locate the route further north so<br />
that the water-crossing can be avoided. Immediately to the north of the<br />
proposed route is the large National Can Company plant. To the north<br />
of this plant lies a closely knit residential neighborhood which would be<br />
seriously harmed if the Expressway were to pass through it. The proposed<br />
bridge therefore appears to be essential.<br />
<br />
After crossing the Harbor inlet the Harbor Route curves around to<br />
meet Boston Street and follows over Boston Street all the way to the<br />
entrance road to the Harbor Tunnel.<br />
<br />
As the Harbor Route first swings into Boston Street it would be<br />
necessary to acquire all of the properties on the Harbor side of Boston<br />
Street between approximately Wagner Street and O’Donnell Street.<br />
There is only one good building in this stretch, however. Property acqui-<br />
sition between O’Donnell Street and the Esso Refinery would, for the<br />
most part, be minor in character and all would be on the northeastern<br />
side of Boston Street.<br />
<br />
Because there are several tight places along the Boston Street route<br />
the Expressway would become a double-decked elevated structure at<br />
about the point it meets Boston Street and would continue in this<br />
fashion to the tunnel entrance road. A more detailed study needs to be<br />
made of the relation between the Harbor Route and the Esso Refinery.<br />

these two highways. A connection to Boston Street beyond the Tunnel<br />

The Tunnel Entrance Road is now two lanes wide in each direction<br />
from the tunnel itself to Moravia Avenue just north of Pulaski Highway.<br />
At Moravia Avenue the tunnel entrance widens and merges into the<br />
Northeast Expressway which will continue on in the direction of Wilming-<br />
ton and Philadelphia. Connecting the Harbor Route to the Tunnel<br />
Entrance Road at Boston Street would mean that this road would have<br />
to be widened from two lanes to four lanes in each direction between<br />
Boston Street and Moravia Avenue. No undue difficulties are anticipated<br />
in this widening. Very little additional land would be needed. Most of<br />
the existing bridges would have to be widened or rebuilt. The Harbor<br />
Tunnel and approach roads were financed with revenue bonds and the<br />
approach roads are subject to a provision in the trust indenture which,<br />
in effect, would prohibit their use by non-tunnel traffic. Under present<br />
conditions the proposed use of a portion of the Harbor Tunnel entrance<br />
road as a part of the East-West Expressway would not be legally possible.<br />
This matter has been reviewed by the City Solicitor, Mr. Harrison L.<br />
Winter, who has advised us that it is probable that this legal barrier can<br />
be removed provided all parties concerned wish to do so. This matter<br />
will, however, need further detailed study if the City decides to adopt the<br />

An alternative eastern termination to the Harbor Route is possible.<br />
Instead of merging at Boston Street with the tunnel approach, the Harbor<br /><br />

Route might be continued more or less easterly across the City line so as<br />
to join an extension to the County Beltway. The Beltway would then<br />
serve as a connection between the Harbor Route and the Northeast<br />
Expressway. This alternative routing would require the taking of addi-<br />
tional residences in the O’Donnell Heights area, but would probably im-<br />
prove the circulation pattern in the eastern part of the City and adjacent<br />
portions of the County. The possibilities of this alternative should be<br />

arterial highway system for a large city consists of a ring around the<br />
central business district with a series of radials extending to one or more<br />
outlying beltways. Since Nathan L. Smith’s 1945 report all cross-town<br />

Myrtle Avenue and Mulberry Street, running south between Pine Street<br />
and Myrtle Avenue, then swinging gradually around to the east so as to<br />
join the Southwest Expressway south of the Inner Harbor at about Sharp<br />

is virtually identical with the Harbor Route.) This link is not part of<br />

On paper the inner ring gives the illusion of being a gigantic traffic<br />
circle, but it would not actually function as such. A traffic circle is a<br />
device for handling intersecting flows of traffic by a weaving process on<br />
a common or merged stretch of roadway. In the case of two intersecting<br />
expressways, such as the Jones Falls Expressway and the East-West<br />
Expressway, the volume and speed of traffic is too great to make such a<br />
device feasible and the intersection must be handled by a grade separation<br />
and a series of connecting ramps.<br /><br />
Although the inner ring would not operate as a traffic circle it does<br />
have a number of important advantages:<br /><br />
1. The geometric requirements of expressway design (including such<br />
items as acceleration and deceleration lanes, minimum weaving<br />
distances, etc.) severely limit the number of on and off ramps<br />
which can be installed within any given distance. Further limi-<br />
tations are often imposed by various surface-level features. The<br />
inner ring, by increasing the length of expressway contiguous to<br />
the downtown area, allows a greater number of access ramps to<br />
be provided which will be of service to the central business dis-<br />
trict. It also permits a more strategic placing of these access<br />
points in a rough circle around the edges of the central business<br />
district. The expressway system can thus provide good access to<br />
all portions of the central business district. Furthermore there is<br />
increased opportunity for surface-street traffic intending to pass<br />
through the central business district to get on to the expressway<br />
system before entering the central business district, thus helping<br />
to free central business district streets of through traffic.<br /><br />
2. The pattern of traffic movements near the center of the City,<br />
whether on surface streets or on expressways, is at best a compli-<br /><br />

cated one. An inner ring will provide some degree of choice of<br />
route for many vehicles. This will greatly facilitate a balancing<br />
and adjustment of traffic so as to minimize the possibility of<br />
bottlenecks developing at any one point. Two expressways simply<br />
crossing near the center of the City represent a somewhat rigid<br />
pattern; the inner ring introduces a degree of flexibility.<br /><br />
The inner ring concept can be preserved using the Harbor Route.<br />
Where, under the 1957 Plan, the ring was completed by a southwest<br />
segment, adoption of the Harbor Route would require the substitution of<br />
a northwest segment. Three variations are possible.<br /><br />
1. The first scheme leaves the Harbor Route at Myrtle Avenue and<br /><br />
Franklin Street and proceeds northeasterly, as shown on Sheet 30,<br />
to Cathedral Street, at which point it turns north, passing east<br />
of the Mt. Royal Station and a comfortable distance west of the<br />
Lyric. This route, depressed throughout, would connect with the<br />
Jones Falls Expressway to the west of Maryland Avenue. Surface<br />
connections to Mt. Royal Terrace are also provided. This pro-<br />
posal would change Cathedral Street between Mt. Royal Terrace<br />
and Chase Street from a through street to a service street; through<br />
traffic could easily be diverted to Maryland Avenue. The plan<br />
would require the utilization of most of Lots 4 and 6 in Mt. Royal<br />

north on Mt. Royal Terrace, joining the Jones Falls Expressway<br />
by means of the presently planned North Avenue and 29th<br />
Street interchange points. It will be recognized that the surface<br />
aspects of this proposal are identical to those developed by Mr.<br />
Barnes for a different purpose. (See Chapter III and Sheet 20.)<br /><br />
Aside from the transformer station there is no great difference in<br />
land cost among the three schemes. The third plan would be the simplest<br />
and cheapest to construct, but it would provide the smallest additional<br />
traffic capacity. A decision among the three need not be made immedi-<br />
ately and should await further analysis and study. Until a decision is<br />
reached, however, it would be highly desirable to prevent development of<br />
the land now vacant north of Oliver Street and west of Maryland Avenue.<br />
This might require purchase of this land by the City.<br /><br />
Additional Possibilities<br />
Adoption of the Harbor Route would provide the opportunity for<br /><br />
43<br /><br />
developing a number of other proposals which would be helpful to the<br />
overall traffic picture:<br /><br />
1. Connection to the Northeast<br /><br />
One of the City’s major traffic problems is the present inade-<br />
quacy of highway facilities between the northeast and the center<br />
of the City. A number of good roads exist in the northeast itself,<br />
but they tend to disappear as one approaches the older sections<br />
of the City and from about 29th Street south there is acute need<br />
for additional facilities. While the problem has long been recog-<br />
nized there has not heretofore been any generally accepted<br />
solution.<br /><br />
It will be recalled that the Advisory Engineers suggested an<br />
elevated structure running north along Barclay Street. At 25th<br />
Street this expressway would swing to the northeast and continue<br />
along Loch Raven Road. While this proposal would work it would<br />
be expensive and, unless a wide path were cleared along Barclay<br />
Street, it would have a detrimental effect on adjacent residential<br />
properties.<br /><br />
From a quick look at a map it might appear that the North-<br />
ern Route runs along the southern edge of the northeast district<br />
and that it would thus be of considerable help. A closer examina-<br />
tion will reveal, however, that there is a gap of about a mile<br />
between the Northern Route and the good highways above 29th<br />
Street. Furthermore, as presently laid out there are relatively few<br />
access ramps to the Northern Route which would be of assistance<br />
to the northeast even if this gap did not exist.<br /><br />
To remedy these deficiencies the Planning Commission some<br />
years ago gave consideration to a proposal involving a depressed<br />","Harbor Route and Related Proposals<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
on a bridge parallel to, and just west of, the Maryland Avenue<br />
bridge. It would then merge with Falls Road. Just north of the<br />
B&O Bridge a ramp for northbound traffic would leave Falls<br />
Road, go over the tracks to the left, and merge with the Jones Falls<br />
Expressway just below the 29th Street interchange. Construction<br />
costs for this plan would be greater than for the first, but overall<br />
costs might well be less. This plan also has the incidental advan-<br />
tage of providing a direct connection between the inner ring and<br />
the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad right of way should this<br />
right of way ever be developed for some kind of vehicular traffic.<br />

and becomes a widened Cathedral Street. It would then proceed<br />
north on Mt. Royal Terrace, joining the Jones Falls Expressway<br />
by means of the presently planned North Avenue and 29th<br />

Barnes for a different purpose. (See Chapter III and Sheet 20.)<br />
<br />
Aside from the transformer station there is no great difference in<br />
land cost among the three schemes. The third plan would be the simplest<br />
and cheapest to construct, but it would provide the smallest additional<br />
traffic capacity. A decision among the three need not be made immedi-<br />
ately and should await further analysis and study. Until a decision is<br />
reached, however, it would be highly desirable to prevent development of<br />
the land now vacant north of Oliver Street and west of Maryland Avenue.<br />
This might require purchase of this land by the City.<br />
<br />
Additional Possibilities<br />
Adoption of the Harbor Route would provide the opportunity for<br />
<br />
43<br />
<br />
developing a number of other proposals which would be helpful to the<br />
overall traffic picture:<br />
<br />
1. Connection to the Northeast<br />
<br />
One of the City’s major traffic problems is the present inade-<br />
quacy of highway facilities between the northeast and the center<br />
of the City. A number of good roads exist in the northeast itself,<br />
but they tend to disappear as one approaches the older sections<br />
of the City and from about 29th Street south there is acute need<br />
for additional facilities. While the problem has long been recog-<br />
nized there has not heretofore been any generally accepted<br />
solution.<br />
<br />
It will be recalled that the Advisory Engineers suggested an<br />
elevated structure running north along Barclay Street. At 25th<br />
Street this expressway would swing to the northeast and continue<br />
along Loch Raven Road. While this proposal would work it would<br />
be expensive and, unless a wide path were cleared along Barclay<br />
Street, it would have a detrimental effect on adjacent residential<br />
properties.<br />
<br />
From a quick look at a map it might appear that the North-<br />
ern Route runs along the southern edge of the northeast district<br />
and that it would thus be of considerable help. A closer examina-<br />
tion will reveal, however, that there is a gap of about a mile<br />
between the Northern Route and the good highways above 29th<br />
Street. Furthermore, as presently laid out there are relatively few<br />
access ramps to the Northern Route which would be of assistance<br />
to the northeast even if this gap did not exist.<br />
<br />
To remedy these deficiencies the Planning Commission some<br />
years ago gave consideration to a proposal involving a depressed<br />

Harbor Route and Related Proposals<br /><br /><br /><br />
expressway which would branch off to the north onto Broadway<br />
from the Northern Route of the East-West Expressway. This<br />
branch, known as the Broadway Radial, would continue north<br />
along Broadway, crossing under North Avenue, and would then<br />
swing around to merge with a widened Harford Road just above<br />
the present intersection of Harford Road and Broadway.<br /><br />
While this proposal would seem to offer a good connection to<br />
the northeast it also poses certain problems. As planned it would<br />
be expensive to construct and the problem has been complicated<br />
in the last few years by the installation of a new major sewer line<br />
in Broadway. Furthermore, it is probable that during rush hours<br />
the Northern Route would be operating close to capacity so that<br />
there might be inadequate spare capacity to absorb any large<br />
amount of traffic coming in on the Broadway Radial from the<br />
northeast. The Broadway Radial does not now appear feasible.<br /><br />
In exploring the possibilities of additional proposals to serve<br />
the northeast, these factors stand out:<br /><br />
a. No new facilities are possible without some demolition of<br /><br />
residential properties.<br /><br />
b. The only section of the Jones Falls Expressway from<br />
which a branch expressway could take off to serve the<br />
northeast is that portion near Chase Street currently<br />
reserved for the interchange with the East-West Express-<br />
way. If the East-West Expressway were transferred to<br />
the Harbor Route this stretch would become available for<br />
a branch to the northeast.<br /><br />
c. It would appear that some advantage ought to be taken<br />
of the possibility of widening Hoffman Street between<br />
Greenmount Avenue and Bond Street by utilizing the<br /><br />
44<br /><br />
strip of cleared land to the south over the Pennsylvania<br />
Railroad tunnel.<br /><br />
d. Harford Road opposite Clifton Park occupies a strategic<br />
location since a number of main roads to the northeast<br />
converge here—Loch Raven Boulevard, The Alameda,<br />
Hillen Road, and Harford Road itself. The City is<br />
already proceeding with plans to widen this stretch of<br />
Harford Road.<br /><br />
Putting these factors together suggests a possible new solu-<br />
tion which is illustrated on Sheets 31 through 34. Under this<br />
proposal Harford Road would be made one way south from North<br />
Avenue to Hoffman Street and, if necessary, from North Avenue<br />
to 25th Street. Southbound traffic would continue down Harford<br />
Road, swing west on a widened Hoffman Street, proceed over<br />
Greenmount Avenue and the railroad tracks on an elevated struc-<br />
ture, and join the Jones Falls Expressway at about Eager Street.<br /><br />
Northbound traffic would follow a similar route in reverse up<br />
to the intersection of Harford Road and Hoffman Street. At this<br />
point northbound traffic would continue straight ahead on Hoff-<br />
man Street to Bond Street. There are several possibilities for<br />
connecting this point with Harford Road north of North Avenue.<br />
Two of these are illustrated. One would provide an elevated<br />
structure to carry the northbound traffic over the railroad tracks<br />
onto Broadway. It would then proceed on the surface across<br />
North Avenue, cut across the western end of Holy Cross Cemetery<br />
and proceed to Harford Road. Another possibility would carry<br />
northbound traffic over Broadway and the railroad tracks to join<br />
Rutland Avenue. Rutland Avenue would then be extended across<br />
North Avenue and the eastern end of Holy Cross Cemetery, swing<br />"," <br />

around to join St. Lo Drive through Clifton Park. Both Rutland<br />
Avenue and St. Lo Drive would be made one way north.<br /><br />
Additional study is necessary to ascertain the best way to<br />
terminate this connection at the north, but either of the two<br />
proposals shown would be less expensive to install than the Broad-<br />
way Radial. Use of Rutland Avenue would be less direct than use<br />
of Broadway but would keep residential demolition to a minimum<br />
(less than 20 houses) and would simplify use of the cemetery<br />
since there are no graves in the eastern end. The Broadway<br />
variation would require the relocation of graves in the western<br />
end of the cemetery and would thus involve many of the same<br />
considerations that were discussed earlier in this report in relation<br />
to St. Paul’s Cemetery.<br /><br />
It was pointed out above that under the 1957 Plan there<br />
might be difficulty accommodating the Broadway Radial traffic on<br />
the East-West Expressway. The same point might be raised with<br />
respect to this new proposal. Would there be sufficient spare<br />
capacity on the Jones Falls Expressway to absorb the traffic com-<br />
ing in on this new northeast connection? It is believed that there<br />
would be as a result of the traffic which would leave the Jones<br />
Falls Expressway to come down the west side of the central<br />
business district if the inner ring were completed as previously<br />
suggested. It can be seen, however, that the key to successful<br />
operation of this northeast connection would be the completion of<br />
the inner ring. In addition it will be noted from the plans that a<br />
surface connection is provided between the northeast connection<br />
and the Fallsway which should serve as a safety valve in case the<br />
Jones Falls Expressway were overloaded at this point.<br /><br />

2. Connection to the Retail Trade Center<br /><br />
The Planning Council’s Plan for the central business district<br />
recommended a number of propesals designed to revitalize the<br />
retail trade center in the vicinity of Howard and Lexington<br />
Streets. Notable among these is the proposal for a Retail Mall<br />
together with a connection to the Lexington Market Parking<br />
Garage. The Plan also recommended that if demand warranted<br />
the garage should be enlarged.<br /><br />
While these proposals are certainly headed in the right<br />
direction, to be successful they must be accompanied by measures<br />
to enhance the accessibility of the retail trade center in relation<br />
to the rest of the City and the metropolitan area. This enhanced<br />
accessibility can be provided by the Harbor Route by means of a<br />
few relatively simple additional proposals. These are illustrated<br />
on Sheet 36 which shows the relationship of the Harbor Route to<br />
the retail trade center, the Civic Center and Charles Center. It<br />
will be seen that in effect three expressway legs come together at<br />
about the intersection of Franklin and Mulberry Streets with Pine<br />
Street and Myrtle Avenue. By adding a few additional access<br />
ramps in this vicinity it is possible to secure a complete system of<br />
on and off ramps to each of these three legs at a point only a few<br />
blocks from the Lexington Market Garage. This traffic can be<br />
brought into the garage via Lexington Street and from the garage<br />
back to the expressways via Saratoga Street. Both streets would<br />
be one way. To avoid conflicts with the heavy traffic flow on<br />
Greene and Paca Streets it is suggested that the incoming traffic<br />
be diverted up Pearl Street and that an underground connection<br />
be provided between Pearl Street and the Lexington Market<br />
Garage. This connection would also be used for outgoing traffic.<br />","-x-<<br />

the indicated reuse would probably be industrial. Construction<br />
of the Harbor Route might thus facilitate the rebuilding and<br />
modernization of certain portions of the City’s industrial plant<br />
which are now old and either obsolete or approaching obsolescence.<br /><br />
Other Possible Routes<br /><br />
At the start of this chapter it was stated that our studies had re-<br />
vealed only one feasible alternative to the Northern Route. Some further<br />
discussion of this point is perhaps in order.<br /><br />
The key to locating additional routes proved to be the question of a<br />
feasible interchange with the Jones Falls Expressway together with the<br />
relationship of the route to the central business district.<br /><br />
No reasonable means of interchange with the Jones Falls Expressway<br />
appeared possible between the Northern Route and the Harbor Route.<br />
For virtually all of this stretch the Jones Falls Expressway is double<br />
decked and in the vicinity of the Orleans Street Viaduct the upper deck,<br />
which must cross over the viaduct, is too high to permit a feasible con-<br /><br />
46<br /><br />
nection with interchange ramps. Furthermore, both here and elsewhere<br />
between the Northern Route and the Harbor Route it would be impossible<br />
to provide a pathway through the center of the City and an interchange<br />
with the Jones Falls Expressway without destroying more valuable property<br />
than would be taken by either the Northern Route or the Harbor Route.<br /><br />
In considering the possibility of routes north of the Northern Route<br />
it was clear that no interchange with the Jones Falls Expressway could be<br />
worked out south of North Avenue. The possibility of an interchange at<br />
about North Avenue was not really explored, however, since other objec-<br />
tions to a route in this area seemed decisive. Proposals have been made<br />
for an elevated structure running along North Avenue. It would be im-<br />
possible to do this, however, without producing a serious blighting effect<br />
on the properties now facing North Avenue unless virtually all of the<br />
properties along one side of North Avenue were taken. This would involve<br />
a degree of demolition greater than for either the Northern Route or the<br />
Harbor Route. Furthermore, there would be a serious question as to<br />
whether an expressway along the Northern Route would be of any benefit<br />
whatsoever to the central business district. Access from such an express-<br />
way to the central business district would have to be by means of the<br />
north-south streets from Howard Street to Guilford Avenue. These streets<br />
are heavily congested at the present time and running an expressway<br />
along North Avenue might simply add to this congestion. The heavy<br />
volume now carried by these north-south streets represents one of the<br />
major traffic problems in the City and is a serious barrier to renewal<br />
efforts in the Mt. Vernon neighborhood. For all of these reasons a route<br />
along North Avenue or approximating North Avenue seems less desirable<br />
than the Harbor Route or the Northern Route and no serious study was<br />
given to this possibility.<br />","Harbor Route and Related Proposals<br />

it was clear that no interchange with the Jones Falls Expressway could be<br />
worked out south of North Avenue. The possibility of an interchange at<br />
about North Avenue was not really explored, however, since other objec-<br />
tions to a route in this area seemed decisive. Proposals have been made<br />
for an elevated structure running along North Avenue. It would be im-<br />
possible to do this, however, without producing a serious blighting effect<br />
on the properties now facing North Avenue unless virtually all of the<br />
properties along one side of North Avenue were taken. This would involve<br />
a degree of demolition greater than for either the Northern Route or the<br />
Harbor Route. Furthermore, there would be a serious question as to<br />
whether an expressway along the Northern Route would be of any benefit<br />
whatsoever to the central business district. Access from such an express-<br />
way to the central business district would have to be by means of the<br />
north-south streets from Howard Street to Guilford Avenue. These streets<br />
are heavily congested at the present time and running an expressway<br />
along North Avenue might simply add to this congestion. The heavy<br />
volume now carried by these north-south streets represents one of the<br />
major traffic problems in the City and is a serious barrier to renewal<br />
efforts in the Mt. Vernon neighborhood. For all of these reasons a route<br />
along North Avenue or approximating North Avenue seems less desirable<br />
than the Harbor Route or the Northern Route and no serious study was<br />
given to this possibility.<br />

iIX. COMPARISON OF THE HARBOR ROUTE<br />
WITH THE NORTHERN ROUTE<br /><br />
Chapter VI of this Report enumerates the factors on which a com-<br />
parison of alternative routes for the East-West Expressway should be<br />
based. This chapter compares the Northern Route with the Harbor<br />
Route with respect to these factors.<br /><br />
Benefits to Traffic<br /><br />
1. Conformity to Desire Lines: Studies made by the Department of<br />
Transit and Traffic demonstrate that both the Northern Route<br />
and the Harbor Route conform closely to desire lines and that<br />
either would develop sufficient traffic to justify its construction.<br />
Anticipated traffic on the Harbor Route would, however, be some-<br />
what greater than on the Northern Route. The reason for this<br />
is not hard to find. The two biggest traffic generators in the<br />
metropolitan area are the central business district and the indus-<br />
trial complex in the southeastern part of the City and in the<br />
adjacent section of the County. The Harbor Route serves both<br />
of these generators better than does the Northern Route. It comes<br />
closer to the center of the central business district and has more<br />
access ramps which serve the central business district. After<br />
leaving the central business district the Harbor Route heads<br />
directly for the heart of the southeast industrial area and while<br />
it turns to the northeast upon reaching the Harbor Tunnel<br />
entrance road there is ready access from this point to more out-<br />
lying industrial sections via Boston Street, Dundalk Avenue, etc.<br />
It seems clear that the Harbor Route conforms more closely to<br />
major traffic desire lines than does the Northern Route.<br /><br />
2. Relief for Present Congestion: Either route would provide sub-<br />
stantial relief to presently congested streets. Because of its closer<br />
proximity, the Northern Route would provide somewhat greater<br /><br />

relief to Route 40 (Mulberry, Franklin, and Orleans Streets) than<br />
the Harbor Route, although the Harbor Route would be of some<br />
help. On the other hand the Harbor Route would be of great<br />
benefit to Lombard and Pratt Streets while the Northern Route<br />
would probably relieve these streets only to a small degree. A<br />
reduction of Pratt Street traffic would allow Light and Calvert<br />
Street traffic to cross more easily. The Harbor Route plus the<br />
South-West Expressway when completed would provide a substi-<br />
tute expressway path for a good part of the traffic now making a<br />
left turn from Pratt Street into Light Street.<br /><br />
It is not expected that the Northern Route would provide much<br />
relief for the streets running north from the central business<br />
district (Howard Street to Guilford Avenue, inclusive) and, in<br />
fact, it might be argued that traffic endeavoring to get from the<br />
Northern Route to the central business district would increase<br />
present traffic on these streets. The Harbor Route would not<br />
relieve these streets directly but completion of the inner ring<br />
based upon the Harbor Route would be of great benefit by pro-<br />
viding an expressway route along the western side of the central<br />
business district to match up with the Jones Falls Expressway<br />
along the eastern side. The relief thus provided to the north-<br />
south streets should greatly facilitate renewal efforts in the Mt.<br />
Vernon neighborhood. In addition, the North-East Connection,<br />
which would become feasible with the selection of the Harbor<br />
Route, would ease present congestion on the streets leading from<br />
the downtown area to the northeast.<br /><br />
In summary it can be said that either the Northern Route or the<br />
Harbor Route would provide relief to presently congested streets<br />
but that the Harbor Route scores higher on this count.<br />"," <br />

Comparison of the Harbor Route with the Northern Route<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
3. Incidental Traffic Benefits: With respect to incidental traffic<br />
benefits, selection of the Harbor Route would permit the widening<br />
of Pratt and Camden Streets west of Light Street, and the<br />
extension of Camden Street to connect up with Eastern Avenue.<br />
Also the land between Pratt and Camden Streets beneath the<br />
expressway could be used for off-street parking. Other incidental<br />
benefits for either route are relatively minor and would tend to<br />
balance out.<br /><br />
Stimulus to New Building or to Redevelopment<br />
in Adjacent Areas<br /><br />
It seems unlikely that the Northern Route would provide any great<br />
stimulus to new building or to redevelopment except perhaps to a certain<br /><br />
degree in the industrial area to the west of Erdman Avenue. Whatever<br /><br />
help it might be in this section would probably be at least balanced out<br />
by the stimulus provided by the Harbor Route in the eastern and south-<br />
eastern parts of the City. In addition, the Harbor Route would have the<br />
following effects:<br />
(a) The Harbor Route would enhance materially the chances for<br />
successful completion of Charles Center. Its closeness to Charles<br />
Center and the proximity of off-and-on ramps will increase the<br />
overall accessibility of Charles Center and render its land more<br />
marketable. In addition, the Harbor Route would clear out a<br />
portion of the undesirable area to the south of Charles Center<br />
and tend to separate the Charles Center area from the blighted<br />
district to the south of Camden street.<br />
(b) Construction of Charles Center, the Civic Center, and the East-<br />
West Expressway along the Harbor Route would greatly increase<br />
the chances for a marked improvement in the character of the<br /><br />
49<br /><br />
old and obsolete buildings now located between Lombard and<br />
Pratt Streets west of Light Street.<br /><br />
Would the Harbor Route adversely affect the possibility of an ulti-<br />
mate large-scale redevelopment of the area around the Inner Harbor<br />
such as that visualized by Mr. Arthur D. McVoy, the previous Director<br />
of the Department of Planning? It is not believed so. Under Mr. McVoy’s<br />
plan new buildings would be kept to the west of Light Street and to the<br />
north of Pratt Street, and the area now occupied by the piers would be<br />
filled in for park purposes. All of this would be possible with the Harbor<br />
Route and, in fact, might be facilitated if the Harbor Route served to<br />
reduce somewhat the present heavy surface traffic around the Inner<br />
Harbor. Furthermore, construction of the expressway might bring the<br />
park into being at a much earlier date than would otherwise be possible.<br />
As a single deck structure and with proper design the Harbor Route would<br />
not significantly block the view of the Inner Harbor from the central<br />
business district. (This view would, of course, be opened up to all of those<br />
traveling on the expressway.)<br /><br />
Benefits to the Central Business District<br /><br />
There can be no doubt whatsoever that the Harbor Route would<br />
provide greater benefit to the central business district than the Northern<br />
Route. The Northern Route passes four to five blocks north of the north-<br />
ern boundary of the central business district and eight to ten blocks north<br />
of the center of the central business district. While traffic coming in from<br />
the east on the Northern Route could turn south on the Jones Falls<br />
Expressway to get somewhat closer to the heart of the central business<br />
district, traffic coming in from the west under the present design would be<br />
barred from a south turn onto the Jones Falls Expressway and to reach<br />
the central business district would have to leave the East-West Express-<br /><br /><br />"," <br />

Eager Street between Cathedral Street and Charles Street. The north-<br />
south streets from these ramps to the central business district are all<br />
heavily congested.<br /><br />
The Harbor Route, on the other hand, passes close to the western<br />
boundary of the central business district and then along its southern<br />
boundary. Numerous ramps along this route would provide ready access<br />
between the Harbor Route and the central business district at a number<br />
of strategic points, notably close to the retail trade center, Charles Center,<br />

bor Route expressway system would provide improved access from the<br />
northeast, while the completion of the inner ring would allow traffic com-<br />
ing in from the north or northwest to choose expressways running along<br />
the east boundary of the central business district or the west. Either<br />
choice would merge with an expressway along the south of the central<br />
business district.<br /><br />
It might be said that completion of the inner ring as part of the<br />
Northern Route system would follow the same line along the western<br />
side of the central business district between Mulberry and Pratt Streets<br />
as is proposed for the Harbor Route and thus would permit equally good<br />
access, at least to the retail trade center. A question of timing is involved,<br />
however. If the Northern Route is used for the East-West Expressway<br />
the Mulberry-Pratt connection to complete the inner ring would not be<br />
built until some time thereafter. If the Harbor Route is selected the<br />
Mulberry-Pratt Street connection would be built at a much earlier date<br />
as part of the East-West Expressway. At a rough guess, the tie-in between<br />
the retail trade center and the expressway system would come at least<br /><br />
S0<br /><br />
10 years earlier with the Harbor Route than with the Northern Route.<br /><br />
Even if no question of timing were involved, the Harbor Route would<br />
still provide better access to the retail trade center than would the com-<br />
pletion of the inner ring under the Northern Route system. Access from<br />
the east and west would be no different, but traffic coming from the north<br />
on the Jones Falls Expressway could not, as design is now proceeding,<br />
turn right on the Northern Route. Jones Falls Expressway traffic headed<br />
for the retail trade center would be forced to do one of three things:<br /><br />
(a) Leave the Jones Falls Expressway at 29th Street and proceed by<br />
surface streets to a tie-in with the Northern Route at Cathedral<br />
Street. (Sheet 20.)<br /><br />
(b) Follow all the way round the inner ring in a clock-wise direction<br />
to about Lexington Street west of the retail trade center. This<br />
would allow the trip to be made all on expressways but would<br />
add two to three miles to the trip.<br /><br />
(c) Leave the Jones Falls Expressway at some intermediate point<br />
(such as Lexington Street near the City Hall) and cross the<br />
central business district on surface streets.<br /><br />
It is obvious that even after the inner ring is completed access from<br /><br />
the north to the retail trade center would be poorer under the Northern<br />
Route system than under the Harbor Route system.<br /><br />
Benefits to the City’s Economy<br /><br />
Any improvement which increases accessibility between the various<br />
sections of a metropolitan area is of benefit to the economy of the area,<br />
and in this general sense either the Northern Route or the Harbor Route<br />
would be helpful. More specifically, however, it is possible to isolate<br />
certain key aspects of Baltimore’s economy and to discover significant<br />
differences between the impact on these aspects of the two routes.<br />","-<br />

Eager Street between Cathedral Street and Charles Street. The north-<br />
south streets from these ramps to the central business district are all<br />
heavily congested.<br />
<br />
The Harbor Route, on the other hand, passes close to the western<br />
boundary of the central business district and then along its southern<br />
boundary. Numerous ramps along this route would provide ready access<br />
between the Harbor Route and the central business district at a number<br />
of strategic points, notably close to the retail trade center, Charles Center,<br />
the Civic Center, and the financial center.<br />

One of the most important—perhaps the most important—factor in<br />
our economy is the port. The Northern Route has no particular relation-<br />
ship to the port. The Harbor Route has a very definite connection. It<br />
runs along the northern side of the harbor and, together with the proposed<br />
Southwest Expressway, ties together many important port-oriented facili-<br />
ties. The Port Authority is in the best position to appraise the value of<br />
the Harbor Route to the port. After reviewing the plans it stated: “It was<br />
unanimously agreed by the Commissioners that the route suggested would<br />
enhance truck traffic serving the Port of Baltimore, and that the effect<br />
of the expressway, at the proposed location, on the development of the<br />
Port from the standpoint of the structure occupying and/or crossing cer-<br />
tain waterfront properties would be minimal and would be far outweighed<br />
by the port advantage accruing by the provision of the expressway along<br />
this particular route.”<br /><br />
The greatest burden on our transportation system is imposed by the<br />
trip from home to work in the early morning and from work to home in<br />
the late afternoon. The relationship between expressways and sources of<br />
employment is thus of considerable importance. Within the City there<br />
are 330 manufacturing firms employing more than 40 employees. To-<br />
gether these firms employ a total of about 75,000 persons. Eighty-six of<br />
these firms employing 16,600 persons lie within 14 mile of the Northern<br />
Route; 193 firms employing 34,200 persons lie within 15 mile of the<br />
Harbor Route.<br /><br />
The central business district with approximately 95,000 employees<br />
represents the largest single concentration of employment in the metro-<br />
politan area. After making allowance for the effect of Charles Center on<br />
employment distribution, the center of central business district employ-<br />
ment will be virtually at Baltimore and Charles Streets. This point is<br />
3 blocks from the Harbor Route; 10 blocks from the Northern Route.<br /><br />
51<br /><br />
While nearly all commercial and industrial firms are dependent upon<br />
the movement of goods, the degree of dependency is greater for some<br />
firms than for others. A study was made of certain types of firms which<br />
by their nature are highly dependent upon their ability to distribute goods<br />
within the metropolitan area or between Baltimore and other cities.<br /><br />
Of the 115 firms within the City engaged in intercity trucking 21<br />
are located within 14 mile of the Northern Route; 70 within 14 mile of<br />
the Harbor Route.?<br /><br />
A selection was made of a number of the more important firms en-<br />
gaged in distribution within the metropolitan area. The location of each<br />
of these firms was then checked in relationship to the two routes. The<br />
results are shown in Table 1. It will be noticed that 114 of the firms are<br />
within 14 mile of the Harbor Route while only 65 of the firms are within<br />
15 mile of the Northern Route. Furthermore, the Harbor Route scores<br />
higher for each category within the Table except that of movers and storers.<br /><br />
Also important to the economic life of the city and as generators of<br />
truck traffic are the major points of transfer between trucks and railroads<br />
and between trucks and ships. Thirteen such points were identified. Six<br />
are within 15 mile of the Harbor Route; one within 14 mile of the North-<br />
ern Route.<br /><br />
In the comparison presented above an effort has been made to select<br />
factors which were both significant and also susceptible to quantitative<br />
analysis. The results are not unexpected, however, since they are fully in<br />
accord with the impression gained by noting on a land use map the close<br />
proximity between the Harbor Route and the areas of major economic<br />
importance to the City. There can be no doubt that the Harbor Route is<br />
of greater value to the City’s economy than the Northern Route.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Blighting Effect<br /><br />
Chapter IV discussed at some length the ways in which an express-<br />
way could have a blighting effect upon adjacent areas and these ways are<br />
grouped into five categories in Chapter V. Since in this Chapter we are<br />
engaged in a comparison of two routes the discussion which follows does<br />
not relate to the sections which are identical.<br /><br />
1. Extent to Which Each Route Splits Established Residential Areas:<br />
The Northern Route clearly splits the Mt. Vernon area in two.<br />
While the large residential area in East Baltimore between Green-<br />
mount Avenue and Linwood Avenue does not have quite the same<br />
sense of well established neighborhood identity as does the Mt.<br />
Vernon area, the Northern Routes goes plowing through this sec-<br />
tion with minimum adherence to any kind of neighborhood<br />
boundary. At no point does the Harbor Route split an established<br />
residential area.<br /><br />
2. Extent to Which Each Route Separates Areas Which for Eco-<br />
nomic Reasons Should Be in Close Proximity: It appears that<br />
neither route is guilty on this score. In each case there are ample<br />
crossings in any section where crossings would be necessary or<br />
desirable.<br /><br />
3. Proximity to High Grade Residential Areas: The nearest ap-<br />
proach to this condition for either route would be the passage of<br />
the Northern Route through the Mt. Vernon area. While the<br />
extent to which this proximity would be blighting is debatable<br />
there is no similar situation along the Harbor Route.<br /><br />
4. Proximity of Elevated Structures to Any Residential Areas: This<br />
factor does not apply to either route from the point of divergence<br />
to the Jones Falls Expressway, but does occur on each route east<br />
of the Jones Falls Expressway. Along the Harbor Route resi-<br /><br />

dential buildings on the north of Lancaster Street for a block and<br />
a half west of Broadway will be about 75 feet from the express-<br />
way which at this point is a single deck elevated structure. About<br />
20 houses are involved. A few houses at two or three other points<br />
in this general area would be about the same distance away.<br /><br />
Along the Northern Route the expressway is elevated for approxi-<br />
mately a mile through a predominantly residential area running<br />
from Bond Street to Kenwood Avenue. The distance between<br />
the structure and nearby houses varies somewhat but would<br />
seldom be over 60 feet and would be less in some places. No<br />
count has been made of the number of adjacent houses, but it<br />
would appear to be several hundred. In addition, there would be<br />
some 20 to 30 houses in Armistead Gardens which might be un-<br />
comfortably close to the expressway which again is elevated at<br />
this point.<br /><br />
It is evident that proximity of elevated structures to residences<br />
occurs to a much lesser extent along the Harbor Route than along<br />
the Northern Route.<br /><br />
5. Close Proximity of Elevated Structures to Retail or Office Areas:<br />
This situation does not exist on either route. While it might be<br />
thought to occur on the Harbor Route where it runs between<br />
Pratt and Camden Streets the clearance of all buildings between<br />
these two streets will leave ample room for the elevated structure.<br />
There will be approximately 150 feet between the buildings left<br />
standing facing Pratt and Camden Streets and the main structure<br />
of the expressway. The effect will be to open up the area and<br />
the construction of the expressway should be an asset rather than<br />
a liability to adjacent properties.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Number and Quality of Dwellings to be Demeolished<br /><br />
Total properties which would have to be acquired for the Northern<br />
Route, the Harbor Route, and the sections in common are shown on<br />
Table 2, divided between residential properties and commercial and in-<br />
dustrial properties. Also shown are properties which would have to be<br />
taken for the alternative methods of completing the inner ring. (Resi-<br />
dential properties are defined as those wholly devoted to residential<br />
purposes. A building with commercial use on the first floor and apart-<br />
ments above would be classified as a commercial property.)<br /><br />
Omitting the sections in common, it will be seen that the Harbor<br />
Route would require the acquisition of only 1,293 properties as against<br />
2,729 for the Northern Route. Completing the inner ring with the<br />
Harbor Route plan would also take fewer properties than completing<br />
the inner ring using the Northern Route—510 properties against 1,089<br />
properties.<br /><br />

The above figures give no indication of housing quality. The demo-<br />

the demolition of a slum building. Furthermore a count of residential<br />
properties fails to indicate the number of dwellings to be torn down. Some<br />
residential properties may contain more than one dwelling (one on the<br />
Northern Route contains approximately 150) and some dwellings are<br />

which appear obviously good from exterior inspection. Poor dwellings are<br />
those listed as dilapidated or lacking private baths in the 1950 U. S. Hous-<br />

admittedly rough, but since the same criteria were applied against both<br />
routes the comparisons are believed to be reasonably valid.<br /><br />

better on all counts. Omitting the sections which are common, total<br />
dwellings are only 1,198 for the Harbor Route as against 3,593 for the<br />
Northern Route. On the Northern Route 21.99% of the dwellings rate as<br />

the Harbor Route, the Northern Route, the sections in common, and for<br />
the two alternative methods of completing the Inner Ring. It will be seen<br />
that the advantage clearly lies with the Harbor Route. Assessments for<br />
the Harbor Route are about 5% million dollars less than for the Northern<br />
Route. Also, assessments for completing the Inner Ring with the Harbor<br />
Route are 1% million dollars less than for completing the Inner Ring with<br />

Total Cost<br /><br />
The Northern Route from the western city line to its merger with the<br />
Northeast Expressway close to the eastern city line has previously been<br />
estimated to cost a total of $194,000,000, including right-of-way acqui-<br />
sition. Total length is 10.2 miles.<br /><br />
No cost estimate has been prepared for the Harbor Route. It does<br />
not appear, however, that its cost would be sufficiently different from the<br />
Northern Route so that this factor should be important in arriving at a<br />
decision between the two routes. Total length for the Harbor Route is<br />
12.5 miles or 2.3 miles longer than the Northern Route. On the other<br /><br />
S5<br /><br />
hand, 3.0 miles of the Harbor Route represents a widening of the present<br />
Harbor Tunnel entrance and the cost for this should be much less per<br />
mile than for new expressway construction. New construction on the<br />
Harbor Route is 0.7 mile less than for the Northern Route.<br /><br />
More of the Harbor Route is elevated than is the Northern Route<br />
and as a general rule through highly developed areas elevated express-<br />
ways tend to be less costly than depressed expressways. On the other<br />
hand the Harbor Route includes one fairly extensive water crossing which<br />
will be relatively expensive, and foundations along the edge of the harbor<br />
may be costly.<br /><br />
A brief review of the Harbor Route by the Department of Public<br />
Works indicates that there would be a number of intricate engineering<br />
problems, the most costly being that of foundations along the Inner Har-<br />
bor. The Department concludes that there are no engineering problems<br />
involved that would be insurmountable. Nevertheless it would be advis-<br />
able to have the engineering and cost aspects of the Harbor Route studied<br />
by a qualified engineering firm. Such a study would probably be required<br />
by the State Roads Commission before it gave approval.<br /><br />
If assessed valuations are a fair measure of comparative right-of-way<br />
costs, land acquisition for the Harbor Route should be less than for the<br />
Northern Route. On the other hand, the Harbor Route would probably<br />
involve the payment of certain damages to the Baltimore Gas and Electric<br />
Company, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and perhaps to the Esso Refinery.<br />
These payments are not reflected in the assessment figures.<br /><br />
It could hardly be expected that either route could be built except as .<br />
part of the National Interstate System with a 909 Federal subsidy. On<br />
this basis either route should involve a local cost in the general range of<br />
about $20,000,000.<br />","HiT ooy ygl<br />

If assessed valuations are a fair measure of comparative right-of-way<br />
costs, land acquisition for the Harbor Route should be less than for the<br />
Northern Route. On the other hand, the Harbor Route would probably<br />
involve the payment of certain damages to the Baltimore Gas and Electric<br />
Company, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and perhaps to the Esso Refinery.<br />
These payments are not reflected in the assessment figures.<br />
<br />
It could hardly be expected that either route could be built except as .<br />
part of the National Interstate System with a 909 Federal subsidy. On<br />
this basis either route should involve a local cost in the general range of<br />
about $20,000,000.<br />

Earlier in this report it was stated that the decision to proceed with<br />
an expressway must depend not only upon the general advantages of<br />
expressways, but also upon the pros and cons of a specific route. Having<br />
reached the conclusion that the Harbor Route is the best location for the<br />
East-West Expressway it remains to balance the price of an expressway<br />
along this route against the advantages to determine whether the East-<br />
West Expressway should be built at all.<br /><br />
Price of an East-West Expressway along the Harbor Route<br /><br />
While no cost estimate has been made of an East-West Expressway<br />
along the Harbor Route the bulk of the cost will be absorbed by the<br />
Federal Government. The cost to the City will probably be in the range<br />
of $20,000,000.<br /><br />
Taxable private property which would have to be acquired for right-<br />
of-way purposes has a present assessed valuation of approximately $16,-<br />
000,000. Assuming a tax rate of $3.50 the construction of the expressway<br />
would produce an apparent loss of real estate taxes of $560,000 per year.<br />
This would be reduced, however, by the extent to which property owners<br />
invested the proceeds of sales in new construction within the City. Such<br />
investment would certainly occur to some extent but it would be impos-<br />
sible to predict the degree to which it might happen. In addition, studies<br />
in other cities have indicated that expressways which are well located<br />
usually increase substantially the value and the assessed valuation of<br />
adjacent properties. Should this happen in Baltimore, and there is every<br />
reason to expect that it would within the nonresidential areas adjacent to<br />
the Harbor Route, the loss in assessed valuation might be largely or wholly<br />
cancelled out.<br /><br />
The East-West Expressway along the Harbor Route would require<br />
the demolition of a large number of buildings. The total number would<br /><br />
59<br /><br />
ooy oygd<br /><br />
be 2705, of which 2020 are wholly residential and 685 are commercial,<br />
industrial or mixed. However, most of the buildings are old and obsolete,<br />
and many are dilapidated or slums. As noted in detail in the previous<br />
chapter only a handful are of any significance.<br /><br />
As a matter of fact, not only would the clearance of many of the<br />
buildings along the proposed route not harm the City, one can go further<br />
and say that their removal would be advantageous. The blocks between<br />
Mulberry and Franklin Streets running from Monroe Street to Fremont<br />
Avenue are a good example. These blocks are a part of the Harlem Park<br />
Urban Renewal Area and are earmarked in the Harlem Park Urban Re-<br />
newal Plan for clearance for the East-West Expressway. If the City<br />
should decide to abandon the expressway it is highly probable that the<br />
Harlem Park Plan would continue to propose clearance for most of the<br />
buildings in these blocks based upon their poor condition. The same<br />
conclusion can be reached for most of the buildings along the Harbor<br />
Route from Fremont Avenue to Light Street. All of these are within the<br />
Downtown Renewal Area and if the East-West Expressway were given up<br />
the applicable urban renewal plans would almost certainly involve the<br />
clearance of most of these structures. In other words, wholly apart from<br />
the expressway, the buildings along the proposed route all the way from<br />
Monroe Street to Light Street are in such shape that a large measure of<br />
clearance would be indicated in any event. This stretch includes two-<br />
thirds of all of the buildings which would have to be cleared if the East-<br />
West Expressway were built along the Harbor Route.<br /><br />
One other price would have to be paid—namely, a very large amount<br />
of relocation both by families and by commercial firms. There is no point<br />
in ignoring this problem, but it is fair to note that by proper planning it<br />
can be spread over a number of years and that the Urban Renewal and<br />
Housing Agency’s Relocation Service would be availgble to assist. In no<br />","X. THE BALANCE SHEET<br />

While no cost estimate has been made of an East-West Expressway<br />
along the Harbor Route the bulk of the cost will be absorbed by the<br />
Federal Government. The cost to the City will probably be in the range<br />
of $20,000,000.<br />
<br />
Taxable private property which would have to be acquired for right-<br />
of-way purposes has a present assessed valuation of approximately $16,-<br />
000,000. Assuming a tax rate of $3.50 the construction of the expressway<br />
would produce an apparent loss of real estate taxes of $560,000 per year.<br />
This would be reduced, however, by the extent to which property owners<br />
invested the proceeds of sales in new construction within the City. Such<br />
investment would certainly occur to some extent but it would be impos-<br />
sible to predict the degree to which it might happen. In addition, studies<br />
in other cities have indicated that expressways which are well located<br />
usually increase substantially the value and the assessed valuation of<br />
adjacent properties. Should this happen in Baltimore, and there is every<br />
reason to expect that it would within the nonresidential areas adjacent to<br />
the Harbor Route, the loss in assessed valuation might be largely or wholly<br />
cancelled out.<br />
<br />
The East-West Expressway along the Harbor Route would require<br />
the demolition of a large number of buildings. The total number would<br />
<br />

<br />
be 2705, of which 2020 are wholly residential and 685 are commercial,<br />
industrial or mixed. However, most of the buildings are old and obsolete,<br />
and many are dilapidated or slums. As noted in detail in the previous<br />
chapter only a handful are of any significance.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, not only would the clearance of many of the<br />
buildings along the proposed route not harm the City, one can go further<br />
and say that their removal would be advantageous. The blocks between<br />
Mulberry and Franklin Streets running from Monroe Street to Fremont<br />
Avenue are a good example. These blocks are a part of the Harlem Park<br />
Urban Renewal Area and are earmarked in the Harlem Park Urban Re-<br />
newal Plan for clearance for the East-West Expressway. If the City<br />
should decide to abandon the expressway it is highly probable that the<br />
Harlem Park Plan would continue to propose clearance for most of the<br />
buildings in these blocks based upon their poor condition. The same<br />
conclusion can be reached for most of the buildings along the Harbor<br />
Route from Fremont Avenue to Light Street. All of these are within the<br />
Downtown Renewal Area and if the East-West Expressway were given up<br />
the applicable urban renewal plans would almost certainly involve the<br />
clearance of most of these structures. In other words, wholly apart from<br />
the expressway, the buildings along the proposed route all the way from<br />
Monroe Street to Light Street are in such shape that a large measure of<br />
clearance would be indicated in any event. This stretch includes two-<br />
thirds of all of the buildings which would have to be cleared if the East-<br />
West Expressway were built along the Harbor Route.<br />
<br />
One other price would have to be paid—namely, a very large amount<br />
of relocation both by families and by commercial firms. There is no point<br />
in ignoring this problem, but it is fair to note that by proper planning it<br />
can be spread over a number of years and that the Urban Renewal and<br />
Housing Agency’s Relocation Service would be availgble to assist. In no<br />

Within Charles Center, Area 12 is located to take full advantage of the<br />
long-term investment safeguards that have been designed into the basic<br />
Charles Center plan--high density of development, open space, and care-<br />

Charles Center is the keystone of Baltimore's plans for its central core,<br />
where private and public interests are making a concerted effort of re-<br />
vitalization and improvement. This program includes the Civic Center,<br />
the Mount Vernon Urban Renewal Project, a downtown campus for the Uni-<br />
versity of Maryland professional schools, Monument Square and Court<br />
House Plaza, an expressway network, and the proposed redevelopment of<br />
the Inner Harbor. Among the other renewal projects close to Charles<br />
Center are two industrial parks for expansion of close-in areas for whole-<br />

A, LOCATION AND ADJACENT DEVELOPMENTS<br /><br /><br /><br />
Development Area 12 is located to the southeast of the intersection<br />
of Baltimore Street and Hopkins Place, at the corner of a new Charles<br />
Center superblock. i<br /><br />
A major asset of Area 12 is the public square to the south and east<br />
of the site (see plan and photo on pages 25 and frontispiece). The plaza will<br />
be builtover an 800-car self-service undergroundparking garage currently<br />
under construction. Also under construction are the other buildings bor-<br />
dering the public square: a 1500-1800 seat legitimate theatre with 39, 000<br />
to 65,000 square feet of retail area and at least 150 public parking spaces;<br />
a high-rise home office building for the Sun Life Insurance Company of<br />
America; and a Federal Office Building containing approximately 460, 000<br />
square feet of office space and an underground parking garage for 185 gov-<br />
ernment vehicles.<br /><br />
Across Baltimore Street to the north will be a new Hilton Hotel and<br />
to the northeast is the existing Lord Baltimore Hotel. Directly west, across<br />
Hopkins Place, lies the Civic Center, which contains a 13, 000 seat colis-<br />
eum, 100,000 square feet of exhibition space, meeting rooms and banquet<br />
facilities. Both of these developments will be connected with Area 12 by<br />
the Charles Center upper level walkway system.<br /><br />
B. A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT<br /><br /><br /><br />
Charles Center is planned with design and building controls in ac-<br />
cordance with the most modern development practice. Each investor is<br />
assured that subsequent developers will provide a suitable and harmonious<br />
environment, consistent with the long range goals of Charles Center: the<br />
best possible development of interrelated land uses, buildings and spaces,<br />
working together to create the greatest possible return both to private de-<br />
velopers and to the City, in terms of revenue, prestige, and design.<br /><br />
C. SITE DEFINITION<br /><br /><br /><br />
The property is '""L'"" shaped, as shown on page 10. It contains<br />
59,486.13 square feet, or 1.37 acres, more or less, with more than 500<br />
feet of park frontage, the same amount of street frontage and more than 300<br />
feet of second level walkway frontage. For the precise metes and bounds<br />
description, see page I-2 of the Proposed Form of Disposition Agreement.<br />","& WL U UL e auwaw auwe vww e v oo evaoaoeououowew oo wae weno e oo o wWw WO oo wL e LD<br />

Across Baltimore Street to the north will be a new Hilton Hotel and<br />
to the northeast is the existing Lord Baltimore Hotel. Directly west, across<br />
Hopkins Place, lies the Civic Center, which contains a 13, 000 seat colis-<br />
eum, 100,000 square feet of exhibition space, meeting rooms and banquet<br />
facilities. Both of these developments will be connected with Area 12 by<br />
the Charles Center upper level walkway system.<br />
<br />
B. A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Charles Center is planned with design and building controls in ac-<br />
cordance with the most modern development practice. Each investor is<br />
assured that subsequent developers will provide a suitable and harmonious<br />
environment, consistent with the long range goals of Charles Center: the<br />
best possible development of interrelated land uses, buildings and spaces,<br />
working together to create the greatest possible return both to private de-<br />
velopers and to the City, in terms of revenue, prestige, and design.<br />
<br />
C. SITE DEFINITION<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The property is '""L'"" shaped, as shown on page 10. It contains<br />
59,486.13 square feet, or 1.37 acres, more or less, with more than 500<br />
feet of park frontage, the same amount of street frontage and more than 300<br />
feet of second level walkway frontage. For the precise metes and bounds<br />
description, see page I-2 of the Proposed Form of Disposition Agreement.<br />

It is the first Urban Renewal Project<br />
for Downtown Baltimore. With it,<br />
Downtown accepts the challenge of<br /><br />
tomorrow with a bold venture.<br /><br />
Here, in one plan, at Downtown’s Center,<br />
are green parks, elegant and imposing<br />
buildings, convenient and adequate<br />
parking, efficient traffic and transit, and<br />
exciting things to do, see, and hear.<br />
Charles Center is truly a contrast with<br /><br />
the area we know today.<br /><br />
Into the planning for this project have<br />
gone the combined and coordinated<br />
efforts of private and public groups'<br />
working together toward the revitalization<br />
of all Downtown. Out of it will come a<br /><br />
new focus for Downtown.<br /><br />
Though simple in concept, Charles<br />
Center brings to the solution of Down-<br />
town’s problems all of the accumulated<br />
knowledge of many fields. You will see<br />
how Charles Center evolves as a logical<br />
plan . . .. how it ties in with and sets the<br />
stage for the Downtown Master Plan . . ..<br />
how Charles Center will be financed . . . .<br /><br />

Looking east across Liberty Street from Park and<br />
Lexington Streets.<br /><br />
You are a convention visitor in Charles<br />
Center. From your window high up in<br />
the new 800-room hotel, you look out<br />
southeast toward the Inner Harbor. Be-<br />
low you, the taxis move in and out of<br />
the Lord Baltimore Hotel. People move<br />
back and forth across Baltimore Street<br />
on the pedestrian overpass with the<br />
bright glitter of flags in front of the<br />
3,000-seat Theater and TV Center<br />
where you enjoyed a concert last night.<br />
The Federal Office Building towers<br />
over the Transportation Park where<br />
people hustle down escalators to the<br />
Transportation Terminal that was put<br />
into operation two vyears ago. You<br />
brought your wife to this convention<br />
for you knew she would enjoy the<br />
luxurious comfort of the quarters, the<br />
fine food, and the charm and grace of<br />
Baltimore, in Charles Center.<br /><br />
You are a businessman in Charles<br />
Center. Your spacious air-conditioned<br />
office is in one of the eight new office<br />
towers, the last of which was just com-<br />
pleted. You find it easier to get top-<br />

wider selection of goods than you can<br />

the stores on the edge of Charles Cen-<br />

the old has life and quality. Downtown<br />
is just as pleasant and as efficient as<br /><br />

exciting getting back Downtown again.<br /><br />

<br />
You are a convention visitor in Charles<br />
Center. From your window high up in<br />
the new 800-room hotel, you look out<br />
southeast toward the Inner Harbor. Be-<br />
low you, the taxis move in and out of<br />
the Lord Baltimore Hotel. People move<br />
back and forth across Baltimore Street<br />
on the pedestrian overpass with the<br />
bright glitter of flags in front of the<br />
3,000-seat Theater and TV Center<br />
where you enjoyed a concert last night.<br />
The Federal Office Building towers<br />
over the Transportation Park where<br />
people hustle down escalators to the<br />
Transportation Terminal that was put<br />
into operation two vyears ago. You<br />
brought your wife to this convention<br />
for you knew she would enjoy the<br />
luxurious comfort of the quarters, the<br />
fine food, and the charm and grace of<br />
Baltimore, in Charles Center.<br />

DETAILED SITE PLAN<br /><br />
The Charles Center site slopes from a high point—88'*<br />
above the water level at the Inner Harbor—at Saratoga<br />
and Liberty Streets, all the way to the low point, 20’, at<br />
Lombard and Charles Streets. T hese grades have always<br />
made walking difficult Downtown. In Charles Center,<br />
they have become an asset. Look at the plans in detail.<br /><br />
88’ Begin at the 88"" level which extends along Saratoga<br />
Street from the Eglin Parking Garage to Charles Street. A<br />
public park faces St. Paul’'s Episcopal Church across Charles<br />
Street and forms a broad entry into the north end of Charles<br />
Center. On the west and south sides of this park, retail and<br />
commercial frontage forms the ground floor of the north office<br />
tower (1). An arcade leads south to the transit depot at the<br />
next level down, reached by escalator, South of the transit<br />
depot, but still on the 88’ level, more commercial space forms<br />
the base of the second office tower overlooking the public park<br />
to its south.<br /><br />
70’  Underneath the public park at Saratoga Street is a<br />
parking garage at the 70"" level. Ramps lead out to a widened<br />
Sharp Street. South of this parking garage is retail space on<br />
either side of the Clay Street transit depot. Buses pull in off<br />
Liberty Street, and move on out to the north on Charles. A<br />
major arcade leads south under office building (2) out to the<br />
main Lexington Mall to the west, At this point the Gallery, or<br />
walkway, is faced on the north by retail space running from<br />
Charles and Lexington Streets, all the way to Liberty and<br />
Lexington. The Gallery meets Charles Street at its present<br />
grade, but extends over Liberty Street with an overpass and<br />
an escalator down toward the main shopping center at Howard<br />
and Lexington Streets.<br /><br />
The Gaﬁery forms a major structural element tying together<br />
retail space at office building (8) and retail and commercial<br />
space at this same level under office building (4). Office build-<br />
ing (5) spans Fayette Street and the Gallery carries pedestrians<br />
over Fayette beside it and to the south of office building (3).<br />
These two overpasses connect with the north side of the Lord<br />
Baltimore Hotel and with retail and commercial space at the<br />
70"" level in the new hotel. Between the two hotels, a moving<br />
sidewalk takes them over Baltimore Street and onto the Gallery<br />
which surrounds the southern public park.<br /><br />
58’ Starting again at the north end of Charles Center, the<br />
58 level shows a parking garage extending to the north of<br />
retail space under the office building (2). The retail space<br />
forms the first floor of the stores above at the 70/ level. It faces<br />
out onto the public park, and extends from Charles and Lex-<br />
ington to Liberty and Lexington Streets. At its center are<br />
escalators tying in the various levels above and below. This<br />
retail frontage continues all the way to Fayette Street. At the<br />
Liberty Street end it opens onto a plaza which is the termina-<br />
tion of Lexington Street. Office building (3), office building<br />
(4), and the new hotel all have additional retail space at the<br />
58 level, the present grade of Fayette Street which forms the<br />
south boundary of the public park. A transit depot extends<br />
on the north side of Fayette Street where buses pull in on a<br />
transit right-of-way and out to the west and south.<br /><br />
South of Baltimore Street the Gallery continues at the 58"" level.<br />
It connects the TV Theater, retail frontage on Baltimore Street<br />
and commercial space under office building (6). Again esca-<br />
lators at key points carry pedestrians to the lower levels.<br /><br /><br />"," <br />

<br />
DETAILED SITE PLAN<br />
<br />
The Charles Center site slopes from a high point—88'*<br />
above the water level at the Inner Harbor—at Saratoga<br />
and Liberty Streets, all the way to the low point, 20’, at<br />
Lombard and Charles Streets. T hese grades have always<br />
made walking difficult Downtown. In Charles Center,<br />
they have become an asset. Look at the plans in detail.<br />
<br />
88’ Begin at the 88"" level which extends along Saratoga<br />
Street from the Eglin Parking Garage to Charles Street. A<br />
public park faces St. Paul’'s Episcopal Church across Charles<br />
Street and forms a broad entry into the north end of Charles<br />
Center. On the west and south sides of this park, retail and<br />
commercial frontage forms the ground floor of the north office<br />
tower (1). An arcade leads south to the transit depot at the<br />
next level down, reached by escalator, South of the transit<br />
depot, but still on the 88’ level, more commercial space forms<br />
the base of the second office tower overlooking the public park<br />
to its south.<br />
<br />
70’  Underneath the public park at Saratoga Street is a<br />
parking garage at the 70"" level. Ramps lead out to a widened<br />
Sharp Street. South of this parking garage is retail space on<br />
either side of the Clay Street transit depot. Buses pull in off<br />
Liberty Street, and move on out to the north on Charles. A<br />
major arcade leads south under office building (2) out to the<br />
main Lexington Mall to the west, At this point the Gallery, or<br />
walkway, is faced on the north by retail space running from<br />
Charles and Lexington Streets, all the way to Liberty and<br />
Lexington. The Gallery meets Charles Street at its present<br />
grade, but extends over Liberty Street with an overpass and<br />
an escalator down toward the main shopping center at Howard<br />
and Lexington Streets.<br />
<br />
The Gaﬁery forms a major structural element tying together<br />
retail space at office building (8) and retail and commercial<br />
space at this same level under office building (4). Office build-<br />
ing (5) spans Fayette Street and the Gallery carries pedestrians<br />
over Fayette beside it and to the south of office building (3).<br />
These two overpasses connect with the north side of the Lord<br />
Baltimore Hotel and with retail and commercial space at the<br />
70"" level in the new hotel. Between the two hotels, a moving<br />
sidewalk takes them over Baltimore Street and onto the Gallery<br />
which surrounds the southern public park.<br />
<br />
58’ Starting again at the north end of Charles Center, the<br />
58 level shows a parking garage extending to the north of<br />
retail space under the office building (2). The retail space<br />
forms the first floor of the stores above at the 70/ level. It faces<br />
out onto the public park, and extends from Charles and Lex-<br />
ington to Liberty and Lexington Streets. At its center are<br />
escalators tying in the various levels above and below. This<br />
retail frontage continues all the way to Fayette Street. At the<br />
Liberty Street end it opens onto a plaza which is the termina-<br />
tion of Lexington Street. Office building (3), office building<br />
(4), and the new hotel all have additional retail space at the<br />
58 level, the present grade of Fayette Street which forms the<br />
south boundary of the public park. A transit depot extends<br />
on the north side of Fayette Street where buses pull in on a<br />
transit right-of-way and out to the west and south.<br />
<br />
South of Baltimore Street the Gallery continues at the 58"" level.<br />
It connects the TV Theater, retail frontage on Baltimore Street<br />
and commercial space under office building (6). Again esca-<br />
lators at key points carry pedestrians to the lower levels.<br />

At Fayette Street the main entrances and exits from the parking<br />

Baltimore Street. Hanover Street has been divided from the<br />
major entrance to the parking garage by a retaining wall and<br />
serves solely as access to the Lord Baltimore Hotel. Between<br />
Baltimore and Fayette Streets at slightly higher than the 40’<br />
level is the main entrance and forecourt to the new hotel, and<br />
retail, commercial and lobby space adjacent to it. Carsecan<br />

20’ level to the south to avoid conflict with the Transporta-<br />

The automobile is a major factor on the urban<br />
scene—and in Charles Center. Along with better<br />
transit, an efficient traffic system and adequate park-<br />
ing are important to the success of the project. To<br />
be really efficient, parking must be within a block<br />
of the drivers’ destination. With high intensity<br />
development Downtown, this has usually meant<br />
that parking structures occupy valuable land, or<br />
are relegated to the periphery. Charles Center<br />
“buries” the auto when it i1s not in use in a 4000<br /><br />
car underground parking garage.<br /><br />
Of the 19,000 people who will work in Charles<br />
Center, it is estimated that 13,000 will come by<br />
transit. This is about the proportion in the core<br />
of Downtown that travel by transit today. 6,000,<br />
or 319%, will come by car in 3,500 autos. Charles<br />
Center places 4,000 parking spaces immediately<br />
under the uses they serve, allowing 500 spgces for<br />
visitor and transient parking. These 500 create<br />
1,500 actual spaces because of the turnover. The<br />
entire 4,000 spaces will be available at night for<br />
conventions, the TV Theater Center or major<br />
cultural affairs.<br /><br />
The interconnected parking garage may be oper-<br />
ated as one facility by one or more operators. At-<br />
tendant parking will be provided, but the majority<br />
of drivers will park their own cars in metered<br />
spaces, and board escalators or elevators to their<br />
destination. Spaces could be reserved for the ten-<br />
ants of buildings above as required.<br /><br />
Entrances and exits to the parking garage are de-<br />
signed to meet peak hour demand. Extra lanes are<br />
provided to allow for unusual loads, accidents, and<br />
effective distribution to adjacent streets. Cars can<br />
evit and enter an any of the 13 ramps at the rate<br />
of 500 autos per hour per ramp. Under extraor-<br />
dinary conditions all ramps can be reversed to one<br />
direction.<br /><br />
On the streets bounding Charles Center, traffic<br />
lanes have been added to accommodate the cars<br /><br />

CHARLES CENTER: COSTS AND BENEFITS<br /><br />
AN INVESTMENT IN URBAN RENEWAL<br /><br />
The development of Charles Center 1s not only<br />
desirable, but also financially feasible from both<br />
the municipal as well as the private investment side<br />
of the partnership. The economics of Charles<br />
Center are sound and impressive. Charles Center<br />
is well within the capacity of the City of Baltimore<br />
and the private investment market.<br /><br />
Study the table at right on financial requirements.<br />
Total cost of Charles Center will be $127,170,000.<br />
Of this total cost, $17,205,000, or 13.5%, is public<br />
and $109,965,000, or 86.5%, is private.<br /><br />
The total value of all of the properties to be ac-<br />
quired will be $24,035,000. Included in this is the<br /><br />
cost of demolition, relocation, termination of<br /><br />
utility service and a 109% contingency. These cost<br />
estimates are based on a detailed analysis of assess-<br />
ments, property sales since 1944, and recent ap-<br />
praisals in the area.<br /><br />
To translate Charles Center into an Urban Re-<br />
newal Plan and to carry it out as a project will be<br />
the function of the Baltimore Urban Renewal and<br />
Housing Agency. It will be necessary for that<br />
Agency to secure working capital. The Urban Re-<br />
newal and Housing Agency will use this working<br />
capital to do further detailed planning, to com-<br />
pensate private owners for the property acquired<br />
through purchase or condemnation, and to cover<br />
miscellaneous expenses. The amount of working<br />
capital, or revolving fund, will depend on the rate<br />
at which properties are acquired in relation to the<br />
resale of the cleared sites to private redevelopers.<br /><br />
The City’s long term investment of $17,205,000<br /><br />

CHARLES CENTER: COSTS AND BENEFITS<br />
<br />
AN INVESTMENT IN URBAN RENEWAL<br />
<br />
The development of Charles Center 1s not only<br />
desirable, but also financially feasible from both<br />
the municipal as well as the private investment side<br />
of the partnership. The economics of Charles<br />
Center are sound and impressive. Charles Center<br />
is well within the capacity of the City of Baltimore<br />
and the private investment market.<br />
<br />
Study the table at right on financial requirements.<br />
Total cost of Charles Center will be $127,170,000.<br />
Of this total cost, $17,205,000, or 13.5%, is public<br />
and $109,965,000, or 86.5%, is private.<br />
<br />
The total value of all of the properties to be ac-<br />
quired will be $24,035,000. Included in this is the<br />
<br />
cost of demolition, relocation, termination of<br />
<br />
utility service and a 109% contingency. These cost<br />
estimates are based on a detailed analysis of assess-<br />
ments, property sales since 1944, and recent ap-<br />
praisals in the area.<br />
<br />
To translate Charles Center into an Urban Re-<br />
newal Plan and to carry it out as a project will be<br />
the function of the Baltimore Urban Renewal and<br />
Housing Agency. It will be necessary for that<br />
Agency to secure working capital. The Urban Re-<br />
newal and Housing Agency will use this working<br />
capital to do further detailed planning, to com-<br />
pensate private owners for the property acquired<br />
through purchase or condemnation, and to cover<br />
miscellaneous expenses. The amount of working<br />
capital, or revolving fund, will depend on the rate<br />
at which properties are acquired in relation to the<br />
resale of the cleared sites to private redevelopers.<br />
<br />
The City’s long term investment of $17,205,000<br />
<br />
enterprise. The division of the sizeable private*<br />
utility costs will be subject to an agreement between<br />

Charles Center will be the focus for a creative<br />
public and private partnership. Only such a part-<br />
nership can make it work. The public partner<br />
must create, through urban renewal, the oppor-<br /><br />
tunity for the private partner to invest. It is impor-<br /><br />
tant, therefore, to view Charles Center as an urban<br /><br />
renewal project . . . . to understand how the urban<br /><br />
renewal process works . ... and how it will affect<br /><br />
the people involved.<br /><br />
Two basic steps in this process have already been<br />
taken. One is legislation. The other is the plan.<br />
The legislation is Ordinance #1210, the pioneer<br />
action that makes Baltimore the first city in the<br />
nation to designate its entire Downtown as an<br />
Urban Renewal Area. This action provides the<br />
legal foundation for renewal action for any project<br />
in the area. |<br /><br />
Private interests have developed the Charles<br />
Center plan in cooperation with the City Admin-<br />
istration and Agencies. The Committee for Down-<br />
town, Inc., a private organization concerned with<br />
the future of Downtown as the key to the health<br />
of the whole metropolitan area, retained The Plan-<br />
ning Council of the Greater Baltimore Committee,<br />
Inc., a private, non-profit planning group, to pre-<br />
pare the Master Plan for Downtown. Based on the<br />
recommendations of The Planning Council, the<br />
Committee for Downtown has approved Charles<br />
Center as vital to Baltimore and to the development<br />
of the over-all Master Plan.<br /><br />
The Committee for Downtown proposes . . . . that<br /><br />
the Mayor and City Administration adopt Charles .<br /><br />
Center as an official Urban Renewal Project . . . .<br />
that the Baltimore Urban Renewal and Housing<br />
Agency prepare an Urban Renewal Plan for<br />
Charles Center in accord with the details in this<br />
presentation and submit this Plan to the Baltimore<br />
City Planning Commission for approval . . . . that<br />
the City Planning Commission approve the Charles<br />
Center Urban Renewal Plan, then in accordance<br />
with law refer the Plan back to the Urban Renewal<br />
and Housing Agency for final approval . . . . that<br />
an ordinance be introduced in the City Council,<br />
public hearings held and after due deliberation,<br />
Charles Center be approved . . . . and that the<br />
Baltimore Urban Renewal and Housing Agency<br />
implement the Plan . . . . by taking action -along<br /><br />
18<br /><br />
with other appropriate municipal departments as<br />
called for in the Plan.<br /><br />
CARRYING OUT THE PLAN<br /><br />
In carrying out the Charles Center Urban Renewal<br />
Plan, the Urban Renewal and Housing Agency,<br />
will acquire all of the properties within the Charles<br />
Center area, excepting five: the Fidelity Building,<br />
the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Building, the Lord<br />
Baltimore Hotel, the Lexington Building and the<br />
Eglin Parking Garage.<br /><br />
In acquiring the properties the Urban Renewal<br />
and Housing Agency will negotiate with the owners<br />
and offer fair market value. These values are<br />
determined by a detailed property appraisal. If<br />
mutually satisfactory prices cannot be reached, the<br />
City then condemns the properties in question and<br />
the price is set by a jury appointed by the Court.<br /><br />
In the Charles Center area there are 250 parcels,<br />
not counting ground rents and other real property<br />
interests. All of these property rights will be<br />
acquired either through purchase or condemnation.<br />
As soon as the Urban Renewal and Housing Agency<br />
has acquired a property, arrangements can be made<br />
for the relocation of the occupants and, eventually,<br />
demolition of the building. Obviously, all proper-<br />
ties will not be acquired at once and staging of<br />
both relocation and demolition will prevent strip-<br />
ping the Charles Center area all at one time.<br /><br />
Meanwhile, street changes, utility cut-offs and re-<br />
locations can take place.” Except for Baltimore<br />
Street and Fayette Street, all streets and alleys in<br />
the area will be closed. Baltimore and Fayette<br />
Streets, in the area, will be widened and improved.<br />
Both streets will be torn up and replaced for a<br />
short stretch over the underground connection for<br />
the parking garages.<br /><br />
The bounding streets are affected, as shown. De-<br />
tails of the street changes will be worked out as<br />
part of the Urban Renewal Plan. Where streets<br />
and alleys have been closed in Charles Center, the<br />
utilities will be abandoned, relocated or provided<br />
for by easement. In some cases, utility lines will<br />
have to be removed temporarily to permit un-<br />
interrupted service to adjacent properties and then<br />
be replaced as construction proceeds in Charles<br />
Center. The utility lines in the peripheral streets<br />
are affected very little.<br /><br />

and Charles Center<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","THE URBAN RENEWAL PROCESS<br />
<br />
Charles Center will be the focus for a creative<br />
public and private partnership. Only such a part-<br />
nership can make it work. The public partner<br />
must create, through urban renewal, the oppor-<br />
<br />
tunity for the private partner to invest. It is impor-<br />
<br />
tant, therefore, to view Charles Center as an urban<br />
<br />
renewal project . . . . to understand how the urban<br />
<br />
renewal process works . ... and how it will affect<br />
<br />
the people involved.<br />
<br />
Two basic steps in this process have already been<br />
taken. One is legislation. The other is the plan.<br />
The legislation is Ordinance #1210, the pioneer<br />
action that makes Baltimore the first city in the<br />
nation to designate its entire Downtown as an<br />
Urban Renewal Area. This action provides the<br />
legal foundation for renewal action for any project<br />
in the area. |<br />

Present zoning permits the new construction recom-<br />
mended for Charles Center with the possibility of<br />
some minor exceptions. However, it is recom-<br />
mended that the zoning in the area be changed<br />
from its present mixed classification to first com-<br />
mercial. The Board of Estimates will need to grant<br />
special authorization to permit the construction of<br />
the building designed to bridge Fayette Street at<br />
Charles, and other buildings that overhang side-<br />
walks.<br /><br />
In addition to the usual zoning and building con-<br />
trols, certain restrictions on building coverage and<br />
design must be established to ensure that every<br />
building maintains high standards and is in accord<br />
with the principles and elements of the Plan. With-<br />
out such control over light, air, architectural design,<br /><br />
- and materials, Charles Center might be doomed<br /><br />
to failure, or end in mediocrity. Such control can<br />
be expressed in the Urban Renewal Plan as a maxi-<br />
mum and minimum ratio of the total building floor<br />
area above the parking garage to the ground area,<br /><br />
and maximum heights of the buildings not fo<br /><br />
exceed a certain number of stories.<br /><br />
In many cities it has been found desirable to estab-<br />
lish design and coordinating committees made up<br />
of architect and business statesmen whose objec-<br />
tives are to referee conflicts, keep the project on<br /><br />
s #<br />
course, and have a veto power over architecture not<br /><br />
in keeping with the Plan. This kind of committee<br />
is necessary to Charles Center’s proper execution.<br /><br />
NEW PROPERTY LINES<br /><br />
When the Urban Renewal and Housing Agency<br />
has acquired the properties, relocated the occupants<br />
and demolished the buildings, Charles Center can<br />
be sold to private redevelopers in various combina-<br /><br />
~tions of new parcels. The price the redeveloper<br /><br />
pays will depend upon an appraisal of the parcels’<br />
economic worth in relation to Charles Center, what<br />
can be built thereupon, and bidding by private<br />
interests. In any case private redevelopers receive<br /><br />
no subsidy, as they pay the economic value for their<br /><br />
parcels.<br /><br />
The tentative land disposition plan shows ten<br />
parcels to be sold to private redevelopers, although<br />
one redevelopef may buy the entire site and parcel<br />
it out to individual owners after development.<br />
Superimposed on these parcels are the maximum<br />
tower development areas, which, combined with<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
limitations on first, second, and third floor coverage<br />
are restrictions on site development. The Urban -<br />
Renewal and Housing Agency, in line with its usual =<br />
policy, will set further restrictions on the use of<br />
the land to ensure consistent and coordinated<br />
development.<br /><br /><br /><br />
The final test of the economic soundness of Charles<br />
Center will be the receipt of firm bids for the land<br />
for its development in accordance with the plans.<br />
While it is not possible to specifically identify re-<br />
developers at the present time, there is sound and<br />

financial interests. g<br /><br /><br /><br />

BALTIMORE CITY AND<br />
CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (WARD 4)<br /><br /><br /><br />
24<br /><br />
In recent years, Downtown, although the center of<br />
an expanding region, has declined. Today, about<br />
the same number of people—94,000—are employed<br />
in the Central Business District, as were twenty<br />
years ago. Over 2,000,000 square feet of once-<br />
productive loft and warehouse space in this area<br />
now lies vacant. This is almost 6% of all floor<br />
space, and creates a critical problem as most of it<br />
is concentrated in depressed areas. Of the 127<br />
blocks in the Central Business District, the vacancy<br />
rate in 26 blocks exceeds 10%, and in 8 others,<br />
some of which are in the Charles Center area, the<br />
vacancy rate is as high as 25%.<br /><br />
The high vacancy is paralleled by lowered retail<br />
sales. Sales in seven major Downtown department<br />
stores last year (1957) were 129 below sales in<br />
1952 . . . . an indicator of Downtown’s declining<br />
health.<br /><br />
Vacant buildings and declining retail sales are only<br />
part of the dilemma. Traflic problems have all<br />
but strangled Downtown activities. The street sys-<br />
tem cannot function as it should, because all of<br />
they traffic of the entire region ‘has had to funnel<br />
through Downtown.<br /><br />
Property values reflect all of these problems. With<br />
a few exceptions, Downtown properties have de-<br />
clined along with everything else, possibly at an<br />
even more rapid rate. In 1952, real property<br />
assessments in the Fourth Ward (the Central Busi-<br />
ness District) reached a peak: just under $156,000,-<br />
000. In the five years since then, the taxable base<br />
has dwindled to less than $140,000,000 . . . a<br />
decline of over $16,000,000, or 109%. While this<br />
spectacular decline took place in the Fourth Ward,<br />
the assessed value of all real property in the City<br />
rose 20%.<br /><br />
Under ‘“‘normal’ conditions, assessments average<br />
about 759 of the market value. However, in 1957,<br />
assessments for seven important properties in the<br />
Central Business District were 109 higher than<br />
their sales price. A number of these depressed sales<br />
were in the Charles Center area. Lexington Street,<br />
between Liberty and Charles, contains the most<br />
dramatic example; in this block, the assessment of<br />
one retail store was almost twice what the property<br />
brought in a recent sale.<br /><br />

decline of Downtown. Downtown activities have<br />
been decentralizing at a tremendous rate. The<br />
rapid decentralization of Downtown can be ex-<br />
plained in part in terms of traffic and changes in<br />
modes of travel, shopping and living. The most<br />
important single explanation is that there have<br />
been too few opportunities for major private invest-<br />
ment Downtown. The problem of land assembly,<br />
elimination of blighting factors and uneconomic<br />
land uses, and the replanning of Downtown have<br />
been beyond the ability of private enterprise alone.<br />
Public enterprise must create the opportunity<br />
through urban renewal for private enterprise to<br />
revitalize Downtown.<br /><br />
Most recent public and private decisions, made<br />
out of the context of urban renewal, have militated<br />
against a revitalization of Downtown by draining<br />
off the energies and the generative factors that<br />
could give rebirth. Urban renewal can change<br />
this.<br /><br />
The time for such a change is none too soon.<br />
Baltimore is nearing the “point of no return” in<br />
decentralization. Regional shopping centers are<br />
springing up at a rapid rate. More than 2,000,000<br />
square feet of office space is now proposed, or<br />
already under construction, in the outlying areas<br /><br />
.. stark evidence of the decentralization and the<br />
unsatisfied market for such office space in Down-<br />
town. If this trend continues, too much of the<br />
present growth potential may have been drained<br />
off to the suburbs, and Downtown must look for-<br />
ward to a permanent decline.<br /><br />
There is real evidence, however, that it is not yet<br />
too late. A recent survey of the region’s economic<br />
activities shows that the upsurge of the post-war<br />
years will continue at least through 1975, and this<br />
expected regional growth will support Downtown<br />
growth once it is triggered by urban renewal<br />
opportunity. Forecasts to 1975 indicate that the<br />
region’s population (City, Baltimore Co., Anne<br />
Arundel Co.) will grow from the present figure of<br />
1,600,000 to 2,400,000: 800,000 more people. Em-<br />
ployment too, has grown and is growing at a<br />
phenomenal rate. New branch plants of large<br /><br />
national corporations, as well as the expansion of<br />
business already located 1n the region, have added<br /><br />
up to unprecedented economic growth. By 1975,<br />
the number of jobs in the area will reach 911,000,<br />
an increase of 250,000, or 389 over the average<br />
employment levels recorded in 1956 in the Balu-<br />
more area.<br /><br />
THE ROLE OF DOWNTOWN<br /><br />
To properly perform its function in the region,<br />
Downtown should be developed with a maximum<br />
concentration of activities consistent with no con-<br />
gestion. The activities most able to profit by a<br />
Downtown location should be located there. This<br />
principle has been wused in planning Charles<br />
Center. What belongs Downtown can be put very<br />
simply. Those functions which take place in office<br />
space . . . business, professional, cultural, govern-<br />
mental and education activities . . . operate best<br />
Downtown. The office building is the key to Down-<br />
town renewal, although once started renewal may<br />
well continue with a variety of uses.<br /><br />
THE OFFICE BUILDING: MAJOR FUN(iTION DOWNTOWN<br /><br />
The favorable forecast for the Baltimore region<br />
justifies the long range market for Downtown in-<br />
vestment in new office buildings. A short-range<br />
analysis of the market for office space based on a<br />
survey in great depth showed many firms with<br />
immediate space needs.<br /><br />
At present there are 21 major ofhice buildings<br />
Downtown with a total rentable area of over 2,000,-<br />
000 square feet. However, the majority of ofhce<br />
users are located outside the major structures in<br />
secondary facilities: converted lofts, etc. Air-con-<br />
ditioned offices are a rarity and few of the office<br />
buildings have high-speed elevators, suitable floor<br />
areas, or the appointments and convenience of new<br />
ofhice space.<br /><br />
Since World War 11, only 300,000 square feet of<br />
rentable office space has been added Downtown,<br />
half of which is occupied by owner-occupants and<br />
the other half by tenants. There is no margin at<br />
present in Downtown for the expected upturn in<br />
office demands. Ofhice building proposed in the<br />
suburban areas will attract much of it unless there<br />
are new opportunities Downtown.<br /><br />
Charles Center provides eight new office buildings<br />
with two million square feet of rentable area. Based<br />
on the regional forecasts and the intensive survey,<br />
the effective demand justifies this amount of new<br />
space. The growth of the region will absorb it<br />
without creating critical vacancies in the existing<br />
ofhice buildings. 'Since 1947, contrary to the loft<br />
and warehouse vacancies in Downtown, the Down-<br />
town’s major offices have enjoyed occupancies<br />
ranging up to 99%, whereas up to a 5% vacancy<br />
rate is usually considered proper to permit normal<br />
turnovers.<br /><br />
THE NEW HOTEL<br /><br />
Charles Center providés fof a new 800-room hotel,<br />
the first to be built in Baltimore for 30 years. There<br /><br />
is every evidence that a new hotel is needed in<br />
Downtown, particularly for conventions and public<br />
meetings. In Baltimore, there are only five hotels<br />
with 200 rooms or more; in Milwaukee, there are<br />
12; in Minneapolis, 14; in Cleveland, 20; in Phila-<br />
delphia, 21; and in St. Louis and Boston, there<br />
are 23. Baltimore’s proximity to Washington can-<br />
not explain this great differential.<br /><br />
Charles Center’s new 800-room hotel will help to<br />
upgrade Baltimore’s facilities in future years. It,<br />
combined with the existing hotel facilities, will<br />
permit convention facilities not now existing.<br /><br />
RETAIL SPACE DOWNTOWN<br /><br />
Retailing will continue to follow suburban markets<br />
to some degree, but at the same time there should<br />
be better retail opportunities Downtown. To this<br />
end, Charles Center contemplates a total of 428,-<br />

decline of Downtown. Downtown activities have<br />
been decentralizing at a tremendous rate. The<br />
rapid decentralization of Downtown can be ex-<br />
plained in part in terms of traffic and changes in<br />
modes of travel, shopping and living. The most<br />
important single explanation is that there have<br />
been too few opportunities for major private invest-<br />
ment Downtown. The problem of land assembly,<br />
elimination of blighting factors and uneconomic<br />
land uses, and the replanning of Downtown have<br />
been beyond the ability of private enterprise alone.<br />
Public enterprise must create the opportunity<br />
through urban renewal for private enterprise to<br />
revitalize Downtown.<br />
<br />
Most recent public and private decisions, made<br />
out of the context of urban renewal, have militated<br />
against a revitalization of Downtown by draining<br />
off the energies and the generative factors that<br />
could give rebirth. Urban renewal can change<br />
this.<br />
<br />
The time for such a change is none too soon.<br />
Baltimore is nearing the “point of no return” in<br />
decentralization. Regional shopping centers are<br />
springing up at a rapid rate. More than 2,000,000<br />
square feet of office space is now proposed, or<br />
already under construction, in the outlying areas<br />
<br />
.. stark evidence of the decentralization and the<br />
unsatisfied market for such office space in Down-<br />
town. If this trend continues, too much of the<br />
present growth potential may have been drained<br />
off to the suburbs, and Downtown must look for-<br />
ward to a permanent decline.<br />
<br />
There is real evidence, however, that it is not yet<br />
too late. A recent survey of the region’s economic<br />
activities shows that the upsurge of the post-war<br />
years will continue at least through 1975, and this<br />
expected regional growth will support Downtown<br />
growth once it is triggered by urban renewal<br />
opportunity. Forecasts to 1975 indicate that the<br />
region’s population (City, Baltimore Co., Anne<br />
Arundel Co.) will grow from the present figure of<br />
1,600,000 to 2,400,000: 800,000 more people. Em-<br />
ployment too, has grown and is growing at a<br />
phenomenal rate. New branch plants of large<br />
<br />
national corporations, as well as the expansion of<br />
business already located 1n the region, have added<br />
<br />
up to unprecedented economic growth. By 1975,<br />
the number of jobs in the area will reach 911,000,<br />
an increase of 250,000, or 389 over the average<br />
employment levels recorded in 1956 in the Balu-<br />
more area.<br />
<br />
THE ROLE OF DOWNTOWN<br />
<br />
To properly perform its function in the region,<br />
Downtown should be developed with a maximum<br />
concentration of activities consistent with no con-<br />
gestion. The activities most able to profit by a<br />
Downtown location should be located there. This<br />
principle has been wused in planning Charles<br />
Center. What belongs Downtown can be put very<br />
simply. Those functions which take place in office<br />
space . . . business, professional, cultural, govern-<br />
mental and education activities . . . operate best<br />
Downtown. The office building is the key to Down-<br />
town renewal, although once started renewal may<br />
well continue with a variety of uses.<br />
<br />
THE OFFICE BUILDING: MAJOR FUN(iTION DOWNTOWN<br />
<br />
The favorable forecast for the Baltimore region<br />
justifies the long range market for Downtown in-<br />
vestment in new office buildings. A short-range<br />
analysis of the market for office space based on a<br />
survey in great depth showed many firms with<br />
immediate space needs.<br />
<br />
At present there are 21 major ofhice buildings<br />
Downtown with a total rentable area of over 2,000,-<br />
000 square feet. However, the majority of ofhce<br />
users are located outside the major structures in<br />
secondary facilities: converted lofts, etc. Air-con-<br />
ditioned offices are a rarity and few of the office<br />
buildings have high-speed elevators, suitable floor<br />
areas, or the appointments and convenience of new<br />
ofhice space.<br />
<br />
Since World War 11, only 300,000 square feet of<br />
rentable office space has been added Downtown,<br />
half of which is occupied by owner-occupants and<br />
the other half by tenants. There is no margin at<br />
present in Downtown for the expected upturn in<br />
office demands. Ofhice building proposed in the<br />
suburban areas will attract much of it unless there<br />
are new opportunities Downtown.<br />
<br />
Charles Center provides eight new office buildings<br />
with two million square feet of rentable area. Based<br />
on the regional forecasts and the intensive survey,<br />
the effective demand justifies this amount of new<br />
space. The growth of the region will absorb it<br />
without creating critical vacancies in the existing<br />
ofhice buildings. 'Since 1947, contrary to the loft<br />
and warehouse vacancies in Downtown, the Down-<br />
town’s major offices have enjoyed occupancies<br />
ranging up to 99%, whereas up to a 5% vacancy<br />
rate is usually considered proper to permit normal<br />
turnovers.<br />
<br />
THE NEW HOTEL<br />
<br />
Charles Center providés fof a new 800-room hotel,<br />
the first to be built in Baltimore for 30 years. There<br />
<br />
is every evidence that a new hotel is needed in<br />
Downtown, particularly for conventions and public<br />
meetings. In Baltimore, there are only five hotels<br />
with 200 rooms or more; in Milwaukee, there are<br />
12; in Minneapolis, 14; in Cleveland, 20; in Phila-<br />
delphia, 21; and in St. Louis and Boston, there<br />
are 23. Baltimore’s proximity to Washington can-<br />
not explain this great differential.<br />
<br />
Charles Center’s new 800-room hotel will help to<br />
upgrade Baltimore’s facilities in future years. It,<br />
combined with the existing hotel facilities, will<br />
permit convention facilities not now existing.<br />
<br />
RETAIL SPACE DOWNTOWN<br />
<br />
Retailing will continue to follow suburban markets<br />
to some degree, but at the same time there should<br />
be better retail opportunities Downtown. To this<br />
end, Charles Center contemplates a total of 428,-<br />
000 square feet in retail space, 300,000 of it north<br />
of Baltimore Street. This is two-thirds of the 640,-<br />
000 square feet of retail space now in the Charles<br />
Center area, excluding banks and personal service<br />
establishments. It is less than 5% of the retail space<br />
in the entire Central Business District. Charles<br />
Center will make for a stronger retail concentra-<br />
tion Downtown, where an estimated daytime popu-<br />
lation of 25,000 persons, including visitors and<br />
shoppers, will create opportunities for considerable<br />
retail activities.<br />

THE CHARLES CENTER SITE<br /><br />
The selection of the site of Charles Center was<br />
the culmination of an exhaustive analysis of the<br />
proper location for office space, specialty retail<br />
space and the hotel, and of the condition of property<br />
in the entire Downtown. The specifications for<br />
Charles Center and its development are exacting.<br />
They are as follows:<br /><br />
Charles Center, must be Dramatic in Size and Con-<br />
cept; it cannot be smaller than it is. It must be<br />
Attainable Without Federal Aid, both because of<br />
timing and present legislation. It should Create<br />
An Immediate Opportunity for new investment<br />
Downtown. It should also have Universal Appeal<br />
from the point of view of public approval as well<br />
as the practical reason that a diversified project<br />
reaches into many “market areas” and need not<br />
depend on one alone.<br /><br />
By no means all of Downtown can or will be new.<br />
This first project should Create An Incentive For<br />
Rehabilitation of adjacent properties. In order to<br />
absorb present uses and take maximum advantage<br />
of Downtown location, it should Intensify the Use<br />
of the Site and Eliminate Blighted, Uneconomic,<br />
or Socially Undesirable Land Uses. :<br /><br />
Looking to the future, Charles Center should make<br />
a Contribution Toward Solving Traffic, Parking,<br />
and Transit problems. It should also help set the<br /><br />
stage for subsequent Downtown projects. In this<br /><br />
way, projects become cumulative, not competitive.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Dear Mayor D'Alesandro:<br /><br />
The attached report represents the culmination of<br />
many years' efforts by your Small Business Committee in<br />
seeking effective solutions to the problem of deteriorating<br />
older business areas. It is a problem of such magnitude<br />
and complexity as to affect practically every metropolitan<br />
area 1in our country, and one that has caused concern on a<br />
national level. '<br /><br />
This pioneer effort by the City of Baltimore formulates<br />
policies and plans for three model study areas reached after<br />
communication and general area of agreement with business<br />
interests in the Light Street and Monument Street areas, and<br />
with representatives of both the business and the residential<br />
community 1n the Pennsylvania Avenue area.<br /><br />
There are contained 1n the report some recommendations<br />
for consideration by yourself and by the City Council, and<br />
by your counterparts 1in other cities.<br /><br />
It 1s appropriate to express our appreciation to the<br />
many individuals and agencies who helped make this report<br />
possible, notably our Chairman, Mr. Reuben H. Levenson; our<br />
liaison with your office, City Council President William<br />
Donald Schaefer; Mr. Isadore Candeub, President of Candeub,<br />

Introduction<br /><br />
Ten years ago, the Mayor of Baltimore, at the<br />
behest of one city councilman ‘and a small<br />
group of inner city businessmen concerned<br />
about the decline of the older shopping<br />
districts, appointed a Small Business Advisory<br />
Committee. After operating for four years on a<br />
purely voluntary basis, the Committee was<br />
given official status by the authorization of a<br />
modest budget and by the appointment of a<br />
Director.<br /><br />
It was the Committee’s judgment that in<br />
discharging the responsibility which it had<br />
accepted, a three-step approach was in order:<br /><br />
1. Identify the problem. 4<br /><br />
2. Research that had been done previously by<br />
others.<br /><br />
3. Seek professional guidance.<br /><br />
A patient has little difficulty in describing his<br />
aches and pains, so the first step was the easiest.<br />
The Committee members already knew from<br />
their day-to-day operations in their own<br />
businesses the malaise which was adversely<br />
affecting them and their business neighbors, so<br />
it became merely a matter of assembling the<br />
necessary statistics in order that the fever chart<br />
would prove the pa’Eient was really sick. The<br />
emerging picture, not unexpectedly, showed an<br />
acceleration of store vacancies, formerly viable<br />
retail stores occupied for secondary and tertiary<br />
usages, a sharply eroding tax base, a steadily<br />
increasing incidence of crime, and more and<br />
more problems in the fields of sanitation,<br />
health and the general welfare of both the<br />
business and the contiguous residential<br />
community. Also discussed but impossible to<br />
document was the feeling of the Committee<br />
that the diminution of small business had<br />
serious sociological overtones in that it<br />
considered the small businessman an integral<br />
component of this country’s middle class and<br />
that a strong middle class was the backbone of<br />
a healthy democratic society.<br /><br />
The source date available in previous research<br />
was limited to one study prepared in 1957 by<br />
Baltimore’s Department of Planning and its<br />
Department of Traffic Engineering. The<br />
opening paragraphs of that report stated:<br /><br />
’Perhaps the most unusual change in the<br />
Baltimore landscape during the past ten<br /><br />
years has been the construction of<br />
planned shopping centers. They rise in a<br />
sharp contrast to the older established<br />
districts. In the new centers one finds<br />
convenient parking, concentrated stores,<br />
new merchandising techniques, and<br />
sales volumes that tax the imagination.<br />
In the older districts one observes<br />
inadequate parking, congestion,<br /><br />
mixed uses, store structures that are<br />
unsuited to modern merchandising,<br /><br />
and much lower sales volumes.<br /><br />
Naturally, this contrast worries merchants. It<br />
worries the community as a whole. If the<br />
older shopping districts are unable to<br />
successfully compete for business, both<br />
residential and non-residential areas will<br />
deteriorate more rapidly, business failures<br />
will be a constant source of irritation, and<br />
the possibilities for revitalizing the older<br />
districts will decrease. There has been<br />
considerable interest in doing something<br />
about this condition, but thus far no<br />
practical program has been developed.""<br /><br />
With all due respect for the last sentence,<br />
candor compels one to report that in the seven<br />
years that intervened between that report and<br />
the Mayor’s Advisory Committee on Small<br />
Business becoming involved, the Committee<br />
found somewhat less than ‘‘considerable<br />
Interest”’. It found an apathy and a tacit<br />
willingness to avoid ‘‘sending good money after<br />
bad”’ in order to concentrate efforts on the new<br />
threat of signs of decline in the Central<br />
Business District. Further on in the report it<br />
pointed out that:<br /><br />
“The general excess of retail area in the inner<br />
city, difficult to eliminate, indicates a<br />
chaotic condition which can be alleviated<br />
only by the application of urban renewal<br />
techniques. It is the kind of situation that<br />
requires the most thorough study and the<br />
most comprehensive treatment. Urban<br />
renewal policy with respect to both shopping<br />
districts and to retail uses in surrounding<br />
residential areas can materially affect the<br />
future of older shopping districts. In the<br />
meantime, neighborhoods will deteriorate<br />
more rapidly; the unneeded vacant stores will<br />
be filled by less desirable nonresidential uses<br />
or forsaken to marginal residential use.""<br /><br />
While the report was prophetic in the last<br />
sentence, it did not conclude on a note of<br />
gloom. It made this interesting observation:<br /><br />
“Most of the new shopping centers have had<br />
their brightest years. They are now but<br />
shakily established, apprehensive of still<br />
further nearby shopping center development.<br />
But now the suburban area has almost<br />
reached the limit to which it can support<br />
further sales exploitation. Soon the last<br />
remaining untapped market for the new<br />
merchandising technigues will be the more<br />
densely populated area of the City, where<br />
the older shopping districts are located.<br />
Nothing stands in the way of this exploitation<br />
but an obsolete, congested, and mixed-use<br />
retail structure.”<br /><br />
The Committee was informed that due to lack<br />
of funds and personnel the professional help<br />
requested from other city agencies was not<br />
available. After more than a year of frustrating<br />
meetings with State and Federal agencies and<br />
officials, the Committee’s efforts were finally<br />
rewarded by an invitation to submit an<br />
application for a Demonstration Grant study to<br />
the then U.S. Urban Renewal Administration.<br />

Project Objectives<br /><br />
The shopping districts established in the older<br />
residential districts of our cities have problems<br />
similar to those of the central business districts.<br />
Unlike the CBD areas, these districts have<br />
neither the plans, the organizational structure<br />
to put the plans into effect, nor the<br />
commitment of local resources and programs<br />
that the CBD areas are increasingly receiving.<br /><br />
This project was designed to carry out a<br />
planning program for three shopping districts in<br />
Baltimore and to recommend methods for the<br />
achievement of these plans over a period of<br />
years. The fact that each of the three areas<br />
substantially differed in a variety of<br />
characteristics led to the expectation of<br />
different findings and results which would have<br />
validity in other communities.<br /><br />
Essential Features of the Study<br />
The study program contained six major<br />
elements as follows:<br /><br />
1. The Research Phase<br /><br />
In addition to the data made available from the<br />
community renewal program and other existing<br />
studies of the Planning Department, specific<br />
studies were carried out reviewing building<br />
conditions, environmental characteristics,<br />
attitudes and market factors.<br /><br />
2. Preliminary Planning<br /><br />
Considerable attention was given to the relation<br />
of each of the centers to its surrounding area<br />
and to the various transportation, urban<br />
renewal and public facility improvement<br />
programs under way or proposed. These<br />
relationships were considered to be particularly<br />
vital in providing the basis for an agreement on<br />
a plan with local business and resident groups<br />
and with city agencies.<br /><br />
3. Development of Planning Objectives<br />
Meetings were held and graphic material<br />
prepared for public discussion to establish<br />
agreement on primary objectives of land use,<br />
district size, parking locations, circulation,<br />
design elements and other elements. Agreement<br />
on objectives was considered to be a vital action<br />
prior to any plan presentation or discussion.<br /><br />
4. Concept Plans<br />
Applying the givens outlined under the<br />
preliminary planning stage and reflecting the<br /><br /><br /><br />
approved objectives, a limited number of<br /><br />
concept plans were prepared and presented for »<br /><br />
discussion purposes. After appropriate review<br />
and some modification these became the basis<br />
for -<br /><br />
5. Development Plans<br /><br />
The specific land use, circulation and design<br />
treatment changes were presented in a<br />
comprehensive fashion suitable for execution.<br /><br />
6. Action Recommendations<br /><br />
Specific recommendations were made on the<br />
utilization of ongoing programs and the<br />
formation of additional administrative<br />
machinery for developing and executing the<br />
plans.<br /><br />
Summary of Accomplishments<br />
The primary purposes of the project were<br />
achieved.<br /><br />
1. Plan Development<br /><br />
Utilizing the procedures identified above, plans<br />
were prepared for each center that related to a<br />
variety of citywide and neighborhood<br />
considerations and reflected the findings of the<br />
surveys conducted under the study program.<br /><br />
2. Plan Concurrence<br /><br />
Following the series of steps outlined above,<br />
there was considerable discussion generated on<br />
plan elements and there was general<br />
concurrence on plans.<br /><br />
3. Plan Implementation<br /><br />
Some of the recommendations of the program<br />
have already been initiated, particularly in the<br />
Pennsylvania Avenue Area. Considerable<br />
further action is required for the full<br /><br />
implementation of the plans for the three areas.<br /><br />
Summary Conclusions<br /><br />
1. Design<br /><br />
The present centers are largely linear strips.<br />
There is a need for treatment in depth<br />
providing focal points, pedestrian plazas,<br />
linkages between building mass and open space<br />
and better functional relations between<br />
circulation, parking sites and service facilities.<br />
Comprehensive improvement can only be<br />
carried out on this basis. The alternative is<br />
individual building improvement and visual<br />
face-lifting that will have little impact on the<br />
functioning of the centers,<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
2. Financial Support ,<br />
Comprehensive improvement will involve major<br />
expenditures. The scale of these expenditures<br />
for acquisition, public improvements, public<br />
facilities, street changes and the provision of an<br />
adequate level of environmental amenities is<br />
considered to be beyond the capability of the<br />
limited resources of merchants in the centers.<br /><br />
Public investment is affected by three major<br />
constraints.<br /><br />
a. In the competition for public funds, these<br />
centers generally have a much lower priority<br />
rating than the central business district,<br />
residential neighborhoods or prime<br />
employment centers such as industrial districts.<br /><br />
b. The expenditure of public funds for the<br />
limited benefit of local merchants would be<br />
opposed by neighborhood groups with a wide<br />
variety of other needs.<br /><br />
c. The number of shopping centers in the city<br />
creates a problem of priorities with reference to<br />
the expenditure of funds for any single center<br />
to the exclusion of the others.<br /><br />
3. Broadening the Base<br /><br />
ltems one and two above, Design and Financial<br />
Support, lead to the conclusion that a<br />
broadened concept of the role of local centers<br />
would create the basis for a more complex plan<br />
that dealt with an expanded center with<br />
multiple functions. This in turn, would make<br />
the center of more importance to the<br />
neighborhood groups and to the city-at-large.<br />
This would then permit a greater allocation of<br />
funds to the improvement of the centers.<br /><br />
4. Utilization of Existing Features<br /><br />
The convenience aspects of these centers, the<br />
transportation modes, the availability of air<br />
rights over parking areas and one-story<br />
commercial uses--these and other factors<br />
suggest that we are presently under-utilizing our<br />
established business centers. The concepts of<br />
vertical zoning, multiple-use structures and<br />
building complexes are as valid in a subcenter as<br />
in a downtown business district. The scale may<br />
be different.<br /><br />
B. Return to Neighborhood Concept<br />
The development of concentration points<br />
around local centers serving the neighboring<br /><br /><br />",". Summary<br />

<br />
The present centers are largely linear strips.<br />
There is a need for treatment in depth<br />
providing focal points, pedestrian plazas,<br />
linkages between building mass and open space<br />
and better functional relations between<br />
circulation, parking sites and service facilities.<br />
Comprehensive improvement can only be<br />
carried out on this basis. The alternative is<br />
individual building improvement and visual<br />
face-lifting that will have little impact on the<br />
functioning of the centers,<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
2. Financial Support ,<br />
Comprehensive improvement will involve major<br />
expenditures. The scale of these expenditures<br />
for acquisition, public improvements, public<br />
facilities, street changes and the provision of an<br />
adequate level of environmental amenities is<br />
considered to be beyond the capability of the<br />
limited resources of merchants in the centers.<br />
<br />
Public investment is affected by three major<br />
constraints.<br />
<br />
a. In the competition for public funds, these<br />
centers generally have a much lower priority<br />
rating than the central business district,<br />
residential neighborhoods or prime<br />
employment centers such as industrial districts.<br />
<br />
b. The expenditure of public funds for the<br />
limited benefit of local merchants would be<br />
opposed by neighborhood groups with a wide<br />
variety of other needs.<br />
<br />
c. The number of shopping centers in the city<br />
creates a problem of priorities with reference to<br />
the expenditure of funds for any single center<br />
to the exclusion of the others.<br />
<br />
3. Broadening the Base<br />
<br />
ltems one and two above, Design and Financial<br />
Support, lead to the conclusion that a<br />
broadened concept of the role of local centers<br />
would create the basis for a more complex plan<br />
that dealt with an expanded center with<br />
multiple functions. This in turn, would make<br />
the center of more importance to the<br />
neighborhood groups and to the city-at-large.<br />
This would then permit a greater allocation of<br />
funds to the improvement of the centers.<br />
<br />
4. Utilization of Existing Features<br />
<br />
The convenience aspects of these centers, the<br />
transportation modes, the availability of air<br />
rights over parking areas and one-story<br />
commercial uses--these and other factors<br />
suggest that we are presently under-utilizing our<br />
established business centers. The concepts of<br />
vertical zoning, multiple-use structures and<br />
building complexes are as valid in a subcenter as<br />
in a downtown business district. The scale may<br />
be different.<br />
<br />
B. Return to Neighborhood Concept<br />
The development of concentration points<br />
around local centers serving the neighboring<br />
<br />

area suggests a return to the ‘““neighborhood<br />
concept”’. However, we are not suggesting small<br />
self-contained neighborhood areas: we are<br />
suggesting that we may benefit from<br />
recognizing that our cities are complex<br />
structures with many diverse elements. This<br />
diversity might readily find expression in<br />
concentrated central points tied to<br />
transportation networks, and relating to market<br />
factors and the proper distribution of public<br />
functions. These centers could be designed and<br />
could function as ““Town Centers"" reflecting<br />
the specific needs and tastes of the population<br />
that they serve.<br /><br />
6. Social and Economic Objectives<br /><br />
The presence of strong centers could produce<br />
multiple benefits in the form of better<br />
identification with a community;<br />
decentralization of training, health,<br />
administrative and job development programs<br />
and a broader range of job opportunities within<br />
a walking range.<br /><br />
Summary Recommendations<br />
The experience with the Demonstration Project<br />
suggests the following recommendations:<br /><br />
1. ldentification of Business Center Role<br /><br />
The business centers can usefully and<br />
efficiently serve as focal points for local<br />
community development and activities. The<br />
total range of activities, public and private, that<br />
relate to the local community should be<br />
reviewed for possible inclusion in the centers.<br />
Considerable emphasis should be given to<br />
higher density housing, transportation terminals<br />
and changes and the location of central places<br />
for public assembly, cultural pursuits, training<br />
and recreational programs.<br /><br />
2. Concentration and Expansion of Centers<br />
The extended linear commercial strip cannot<br />
provide strong focal points, cannot be<br />
economically served by bulk parking areas and<br />
does not provide strong interaction between<br />
activities. It is recommended that such centers<br />
be concentrated and that linear distances be<br />
decreased.<br /><br />
It is also recommended that the central<br />
portions of the center be expanded to provide<br />
for unified design, organized exterior<br />
circulation and appropriate access and adequate<br />
open space for pedestrian use, landscaping and<br />
sitting area.<br /><br />
A longer range recommendation is for an<br />
ultimate decrease in the number of centers, |<br />
strengthening the more viable ones and seeking<br />
greater productivity of land use of the<br />
submarginal ones through reuse for nonretail<br />
purposes, i.e., housing, industry, open space or<br />
public facilities.<br /><br />
3. Design<br /><br />
The extensive street areas, utilization of<br />
ground-level sites for parking, and single-story<br />
commercial use is a wasteful use of our urban<br />
land. We recommend land consolidation,<br />
elimination of interior streets and vertical<br />
zoning for multiple purposes.<br /><br />
4, Implementation<br /><br />
The scale of effort needed will not be achieved<br />
except through concentrated urban renewal<br />
projects or in various combinations of public<br />
and private administrative machinery and<br /><br />
financing. This will undoubtedly require further<br />
~legislation and experimentation. The scale of<br /><br />
the changes is too broad to be carried out by<br />
private enterprise alone and it is too involved<br />
with the commercial life of the community to<br />
be carried out without the assistance and<br />
participation of private investors and<br />
entrepreneurs.<br /><br />
5. Citizen Participation<br /><br />
The leverage for change consists of strong<br />
community concern, continuous demands and<br />
widespread agreement on the type of<br />
improvements that are needed. The momentum<br />
for change may be stimulated by business<br />
leadership and, in part, guided by it. The<br />
incentive for change is the potential for an<br />
increased tax base, providing additional funds<br />
to the City for health, education, welfare and<br />
other programs. However, major change within<br />
largely residential neighborhoods, where the<br />
residents and the businesses are mutually -<br />
dependent one upon the other, requires the<br />
active interest and participation and initiative<br />
of local residents.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"," <br />

At the time the program for this study was<br />
established, the scope of the project was limited<br />
to three ‘‘neighborhood shopping centers’” in<br />
Baltimore. The assignment was undertaken on<br />
that basis but, during the course of the project,<br />
a turning point was reached. These observations<br />
are offered as a retrospective comment on the<br />
study and hopefully will help in forming the<br />
approach to similar studies.<br /><br />
The turning point was a realization that the<br />
three areas under study were not merely<br />
“'neighborhood shopping centers’’ and that<br />
their problems were not merely those of small<br />
commercial subcenters. At the same time, there<br />
was a realization that the city was unlikely to<br />
place the three areas high on its priority list and<br />
commit major expenditures there if the three<br />
areas were to continue as small neighborhood<br />
shopping centers.<br /><br />
It became obvious that the traditional<br />
identification of these areas as neighborhood<br />
shopping centers had to change, because the<br />
centers had a much larger role to play than that<br />
of limited shopping areas.<br /><br />
In considering a broader role for the three areas,<br />
it is necessary to regard the city--any city--as<br /><br />
a city made up of a number of sub-units or<br />
communities of interest, and that each sub-unit<br />
has a number of common or central functions.<br />
In fact, the central functions often define the<br />
extent of the community of interest.<br /><br />
Unlike central business districts--traditionally<br />
acknowledged and defined as the central place<br />
of a metropolitan area-the centers of these<br />
sub-units or communities have not been<br />
defined.<br /><br />
Based on this study and incorporated into its<br />
recommendations are a number of conclusions<br />
which are based on a broader concept of<br />
community centers, rather than neighborhood<br />
shopping areas. This new concept offers a new<br />
perspective on community centers for these<br />
reasons:<br /><br />
1. The role of the community center within a<br />
citywide frame is redefined. No longer can<br />
these centers be relegated to low-priority action<br />
status. They deserve recognition as key areas<br />
within the city where public commitment must<br />
be concentrated, where private investment must<br />
be stimulated, and through which social<br /><br /><br /><br />
programs are administered. Token parking,<br />
traffic and retail service improvements will<br />
themselves no longer suffice for the commu nity<br />
center.<br /><br />
2. The role of a community center relative to<br />
its community is redefined. Community centers<br />
must reflect the character of the communities<br />
they serve. Each center must have an identity<br />
of social significance to its community and, to<br />
do this, must offer the complete range of<br />
services and resources that community needs.<br />
Thus, if a community is predominantly black,<br />
the center of that community should cater to<br />
the needs, tastes and budgets of the Black<br />
population. If a community is poor, then the<br />
opportunities for job training, employment and<br />
economic advancement should be concentrated<br />
at the center. And if the community is both<br />
poor and black, the priority for action at the<br />
community center cannot be overstated.<br /><br />
3. The functional role of the commu nity center<br />
is redefined. No longer can community centers<br />
be merely conglomerations of retail stores. The<br />
community center must be a multi-purpose<br />
complex of activities. |t must be easily<br />
accessible by road, mass transit or on foot. Its<br />
activities must be broadened to include<br />
compatible commercial uses, such as offices. lts<br />
market must be increased and improved by<br />
concentrating high-density housing within it or<br />
around it. The broader concept of a community<br />
center is the traditional concept of downtown<br />
proportionately scaled to a community role.<br /><br />
4. The physical form of the community center<br />
has to be reconstructed. Older one- and<br />
two-story buildings constrained by obsolete<br />
zoning ordinances cannot accommodate the<br />
broader physical function defined above. The<br />
air rights above these buildings and the large<br />
parking areas they need are particularly<br />
valuable. Not only will new multi-story<br />
construction above retail uses and parking<br />
provide valuable, concentrated space, it will<br />
also provide improved accessibility to all the<br />
uses involved. The air rights approach has<br />
timing advantages as well: Centers can reserve<br />
large parking lots as ""“landbanks’ upon which<br />
multi-story construction can be built when<br />
sufficient demand is created.<br /><br />
5. The image of a community center as<br />
self-contained is broadened to permit linkages<br />
with other major community activities. When a<br /><br />
community is so dominated by a single activity<br />
or character, and where that activity or'zl<br />
character has physical implications, the'<br />
community center should relate to it. A major<br />
facility such as a hospital, university or<br />
industrial complex provides needed markets for<br />
a retail center. 1t also requires services,<br />
accessibility and housing facilities which the<br />
community center can provide. Thisis a<br />
mutually beneficial trade-off which can be<br />
facilitated by physical links such as pedestrian<br />
malls, plazas and mutual parking areas.<br /><br /><br /><br />
6. The commitment to the commu nity center<br />
has been redefined. In a period when the need<br />
for neighborhood stability and personal<br />
identification with and pride in one s own<br />
neighborhood must be recognized as vitally<br />
important to the city as a whole, city<br />
governments must grant the community center<br />
priority status. This means that decisions on<br />
transit stops, decentralized city offices and<br />
zoning changes should be directed toward the<br />
needs of a community center. More important<br />
where public expenditure must be made, the<br />
traditional red tape, delays and budget cuts<br />
must be avoided.<br /><br />
In order to effectively transform a problem ares<br />
of a city into a viable business area, a<br />
meaningful community center and a more<br />
stabilized residential neighborhood, a coalition<br />
of city officials, vested business interests and<br />
representatives of the indigenous community<br />
must all participate in the initial as well as the<br />
subsequent stages of the planning process.<br /><br />
At a time when our older cities are plagued<br />
with problems which outdate traditional<br />
thinking, it is fashionable, and indeed<br />
reasonable, to promote the concept of entirely<br />
new towns which will give us the chance to<br />
start again. These new towns will be models of<br />
city building, reflecting all the new concepts<br />
including those of community centers with a<br />
much broader range of functions. We must<br />
build these new towns, but we dare not forget<br />
the older cities which are responsive to the<br />
same needs. The initiation of new town<br />
concepts in older cities could readily be given<br />
momentum through the revitalization of cent!<br />
places such as the Light Streets, Monument<br />
Streets and Pennsylvania Avenues across the<br />
nation.<br /><br />

provide valuable, concentrated space, it will<br />
also provide improved accessibility to all the<br />
uses involved. The air rights approach has<br />
timing advantages as well: Centers can reserve<br />
large parking lots as ""“landbanks’ upon which<br />
multi-story construction can be built when<br />
sufficient demand is created.<br />
<br />
5. The image of a community center as<br />
self-contained is broadened to permit linkages<br />
with other major community activities. When a<br />
<br />
community is so dominated by a single activity<br />
or character, and where that activity or'zl<br />
character has physical implications, the'<br />
community center should relate to it. A major<br />
facility such as a hospital, university or<br />
industrial complex provides needed markets for<br />
a retail center. 1t also requires services,<br />
accessibility and housing facilities which the<br />
community center can provide. Thisis a<br />
mutually beneficial trade-off which can be<br />
facilitated by physical links such as pedestrian<br />
malls, plazas and mutual parking areas.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
6. The commitment to the commu nity center<br />
has been redefined. In a period when the need<br />
for neighborhood stability and personal<br />
identification with and pride in one s own<br />
neighborhood must be recognized as vitally<br />
important to the city as a whole, city<br />
governments must grant the community center<br />
priority status. This means that decisions on<br />
transit stops, decentralized city offices and<br />
zoning changes should be directed toward the<br />
needs of a community center. More important<br />
where public expenditure must be made, the<br />
traditional red tape, delays and budget cuts<br />
must be avoided.<br />
<br />
In order to effectively transform a problem ares<br />
of a city into a viable business area, a<br />
meaningful community center and a more<br />
stabilized residential neighborhood, a coalition<br />
of city officials, vested business interests and<br />
representatives of the indigenous community<br />
must all participate in the initial as well as the<br />
subsequent stages of the planning process.<br />
<br />
At a time when our older cities are plagued<br />
with problems which outdate traditional<br />
thinking, it is fashionable, and indeed<br />
reasonable, to promote the concept of entirely<br />
new towns which will give us the chance to<br />
start again. These new towns will be models of<br />
city building, reflecting all the new concepts<br />
including those of community centers with a<br />
much broader range of functions. We must<br />
build these new towns, but we dare not forget<br />
the older cities which are responsive to the<br />
same needs. The initiation of new town<br />
concepts in older cities could readily be given<br />
momentum through the revitalization of cent!<br />
places such as the Light Streets, Monument<br />
Streets and Pennsylvania Avenues across the<br />
nation.<br />

Statement of Problem<br /><br />
In the post World War || decades, major<br />
changes in shopping habits and population<br />
expansion into the suburbs of our cities have<br />
resulted in the creation of new regional<br />
shopping complexes competing with older<br />
business districts. These shifts were particularly<br />
damaging to central business districts, and in<br />
most major cities a variety of programs have<br />
been initiated to assist these districts in the<br />
difficult process of eliminating blighted sectors,<br />
traffic congestion, parking shortages and in<br />
setting the basis for physical and economic<br />
revitalization.<br /><br />
The smaller established business districts have<br />
also felt the impact of changing shopping<br />
patterns and of population movements but have<br />
not received either the level of concern or the<br />
relative degree of public improvement efforts<br />
that have gone to central areas.<br /><br />
The present circumstances of these centers vary<br />
with relation to such factors as neighborhood<br />
income, accessibility, the strength and<br />
merchandising ability of local merchants and a<br />
number of other factors. Some have been<br />
severely affected by urban blight; others less so.<br />
Some now have a considerable number of<br />
vacant stores; others have maintained<br />
themselves without major economic losses.<br /><br />
Under either condition, there is a need for a<br />
sense of direction with regard to the future.<br />
Virtually no older center can be viewed as well<br />
designed or fully supported by adequate<br />
circulation, parking, public facilities and<br />
amenities.<br /><br />
These conditions have led to periodic demands<br />
from the merchants of individual centers for<br />
additional parking, improved lighting, better<br />
trash collection and similar services. To the<br />
degree that they can make their voices heard in<br />
the inner circles of city government, when<br />
funds are available and there is no organized<br />
opposition to their proposals, some<br />
improvements are made. However, these<br />
isolated improvements are of limited value and<br />
are far short of the general level of<br />
improvement needed by these centers.<br /><br />
The problem is, therefore, to define what is<br />
needed and to establish a program that would<br /><br />
permit those needs to be met over a period of<br />
time.<br /><br />
Sponsorship of study<br /><br />
This study originated in Baltimore out of the<br />
concern of the Mayor’s Advisory Committee on<br />
Small Business about the need for a program of<br />
improving the older centers and safeguarding<br />
the future of small business operations in these<br />
centers against increasing competition. The first<br />
work undertaken in examining the centers and<br />
their neighborhoods and their shopping<br />
potentialities was carried out under Baltimore's<br />
Community Renewal Program studies.<br /><br />
The sponsorship of this Demonstration Study<br />
by the Mayor’s Advisory Committee on Small<br />
Business was particularly advantageous since it<br />
permitted a thorough review and discussion of<br />
proposals without committing the planning and<br />
urban renewal agencies of the City to official<br />
action on any specific plan.<br /><br />
Representatives of Baltimore's Urban Renewal<br />
and Housing Agency and the Department of<br />
Planning were on the project’s Advisory Board<br />
and the work of these agencies was utilized<br />
during the course of this study.<br /><br />
The Study Areas<br /><br />
The Mayor'’s Advisory Commlttee on Small<br />
Business recommended the study areas after<br />
examining 17 older community shopping<br />
centers, all located outside the central business<br />
district. The three areas chosen for the study<br />
were:<br /><br />
Light Street:<br /><br />
Located south of the central business district<br />
near the Port of Baltimore, it serves a<br />
blue-collar population and contains some<br />
aggressive and moderately successful stores. The<br />
shopping area is on a heavily travelled route<br />
between the central business district and the<br />
port area.<br /><br />
Monument Street:<br /><br />
A basically sound commercial strip located east<br />
of the central business district. Although<br />
deterioration is not yet serious, the businesses<br />
serving the low- to moderate-income pOpulatlon<br />
of the area are not thriving.<br /><br />
Pennsylvania Avenue:<br />
A commercial strip cutting diagonally across<br /><br />
several blocks northwest of the central business<br />
district. It contains areas of severe blight arid<br />
has major traffic problems. The upper end of<br />
the strip is a concentrated and active shopping<br />
area and has been described as the center of the<br />
Baltimore ghetto.<br /><br />
The three centers are typical of many older<br />
shopping areas in cities throughout the United<br />
States. Historically, they were important as<br />
satellite cores which developed on the outskirts<br />
of the growing city. All three centers were<br />
actively developed between 1800 and 1880.<br /><br />
Today, the shopping areas are small centers in a<br />
large region. Baltimore is the center of a<br />
five-county region. Its downtown area is both<br />
the center of Baltimore and to a lesser extent of<br />
the entire region. The three areas under study<br />
are among six such shopping areas in the city<br />
containing public markets. The three shopping<br />
areas are centers of communities which, for<br />
purposes of study, are delineated as trade areas.<br />
It is to these shopping areas that most residents<br />
in the surrounding community come to<br />
purchase food, drugs, furniture and clothing.<br /><br />
- While the three trade areas overlap with trade<br /><br />
areas of other neighborhood shopping areas, the<br />
majority of shoppers originate from a slightly<br />
smaller trade area, determined by a 15-minute<br />
walking distance. All three centers are served by<br />
public transportation and transfer points where<br />
change of mode, transportation and direction<br />
can be made.<br /><br />
In general, these procedures were successfully<br />
followed and programs were formulated for the<br />
three areas with a fair amount of agreement.<br />
However, in the the process of following the<br />
procedure, it became apparent that a number of<br />
faulty assumptions were made. The study<br />
resulted in a number of conclusions, separate<br />
and apart from the design solutions, which are<br />
considered to be particularly relevant to any<br />
future work in this field.<br /><br />
As a matter of record the report describes the<br />
methodology followed, the ultimate concepts<br />
and the proposed solutions which are relevant<br />
and appropriate. This is supplemented with<br />
some observations and suggestions for various<br />
approaches which would be more conductive to<br />
the development of appropriate programs and<br />
plans in this type of area in the future.<br />","I1l. Background of the Program<br />

methodology followed, the ultimate concepts<br />
and the proposed solutions which are relevant<br />
and appropriate. This is supplemented with<br />
some observations and suggestions for various<br />
approaches which would be more conductive to<br />
the development of appropriate programs and<br />
plans in this type of area in the future.<br />

1. Preliminary Survey<br /><br />
Numerous studies and documents prepared in<br />
the previous five years were examined as<br />
possible sources of background material. A<br />
total of 69 reports, brochures and data sheets<br />
and more than 40 maps--all prepared for<br />
various agencies in Baltimore--were<br /><br />
examined to provide a general framework for<br />
understanding the physical, social and<br />
economic forces which had influenced the<br />
development of these three study areas.<br /><br />
It was found that, physically, the three areas<br />
have several characteristics in common, as well<br />
as a few significant differences.<br /><br />
Once important as shopping areas for<br />
residential developments on the fringe of the<br />
growing city, they are now showing signs of<br />
their age. There are large numbers of<br />
deteriorated buildings which are functionally<br />
inefficient and difficult to adapt to today’s<br />
tastes. Ground-floor stores with apartments<br />
above are common, often stretching for several<br />
blocks along major streets or extending for<br />
several blocks in several directions from a main<br />
corner.<br /><br />
The shopping areas are small centers in a large<br />
region, centered in Baltimore. Baltimore is the<br />
center of a five-county region and its<br />
downtown area serves this larger area as well as<br />
the city itself.<br /><br />
The three areas studied each contain a public<br />
market, a common structure divided into stalls<br />
where vendors sell their wares, usually food.<br />
Three other older shopping areas of the 17 such<br />
areas identified by the city also contain a public<br />
market.<br /><br />
The three shopping areas are patronized by<br />
residents of surrounding neighborhoods who<br />
can conveniently walk there to buy food, drugs,<br />
clothing and furniture, as well as by a steadily<br />
increasing number of shoppers who come by<br />
private or public transportation. In that sense,<br />
they serve as centers of a community. They also<br />
have a focus as a place where people in the area<br />
go to use public transportation. All three areas<br />
are well served by public transportation and<br />
also act as transfer points where people can<br />
change mode of travel or change direction,<br />
from one bus to another.<br /><br />
2. Survey and Analysis<br /><br />
a. Building survey<br /><br />
A detailed structural survey was made of all<br />
buildings in the three study areas. A survey<br />
form was designed to measure factors<br />
contributing to deterioration and buildings<br />
were classified into four general categories:<br /><br />
Standard<br /><br />
Deficient - 1st degree<br />
Deficient - 2nd degree<br />
Substandard<br /><br />
The categories were related as much as possible<br />
to possible rehabilitation efforts in the future.<br />
Structures requiring little or no rehabilitation<br />
were rated as standard. Those requiring<br />
rehabilitation so extensive as to be prohibitive<br />
in cost were classified as substandard. In<br />
between were the deficient buildings: Those<br />
which could be easily rehabilitated and those<br />
requiring substantial rehabilitation.<br /><br />
A manual was prepared and training sessions<br />
held for city building inspectors who carried<br />
out the survey, to insure that buildings were<br />
evaluated on a uniform basis. Information<br />
obtained was transferred to data processing<br />
cards and analyzed on the basis of land uses<br />
found in each study area and also on a<br />
block-by-block basis within each area. The<br />
findings of the structural survey are<br />
summarized in the following table.<br /><br />

b. General Surveys ]<br /><br />
An evaluation was made of factors affecting the<br />
environment of the three areas, including<br />
exterior building condition, level of street and<br />
sidewalk maintenance, nuisance uses, presence<br />
of adequate utilities, condition of rear yards<br />
and such favorable features as trees and<br />
plantings.<br /><br />
Available city reports were reviewed and a<br />
limited field inspection made to evaluate land<br />
use, building conditions and community<br />
facilities. Street and traffic plans were reviewed<br />
and an evaluation made of traffic and its impact<br />
on the areas. Existing parking facilities were<br />
evaluated in terms of availability, type, location<br />
and appearance.<br /><br />
Property owners in the three areas have made<br />
only limited improvements to their premises<br />
over the years. The resulting deterioration has<br />
left the areas blighted and functionally<br />
inefficient.<br /><br />
There is a high incidence of vacant land and<br />
floor space, and property values have not<br />
increased at a level experienced by other parts<br />
of the city. In fact, tax assessments from 1953<br />
to 1963, including changes in valuation<br />
resulting from demolition and new<br />
construction, showed a decrease in the<br />
seventeen older areas of 6%, while showing an<br />
increase of 27% in the remainder of the city.<br /><br />
Most streets in the three areas are congested,<br />
and there is a lack of parking space for shoppers<br />
and loading space for vehicles servicing the<br />
businesses in the areas. This makes it difficult<br />
for pedestrians to move about safely and<br />
conveniently.<br /><br />
There is a distinct lack of amenities for people<br />
in the area, such as open spaces for resting and<br />
observation, and little, if any, landscaping. In<br />
addition, the visual effect of signs, traffic<br />
signals, street furniture, storefronts and<br />
advertising combine to present an unattractive<br />
scene to the shopper or passerby.<br /><br />

Existing reports were examined to determine<br />
the present function of each area, the size and<br />
scope of its retail sector, characteristics of its<br />
trade area population, and prospective<br />
population and income levels. In addition, each<br />
area was evaluated in terms of special problems<br />
and assets.<br /><br />
General data regarding the city and the region<br />
were examined as a framework for evaluating<br />
the market potential of the three areas. Any<br />
renewal activities, transportation proposals or<br />
similar programs were evaluated to determine<br />
their possible socio-economic effect on each<br />
area.<br /><br />
2. Surveys<br /><br />
A mail survey was conducted among merchants<br />
in the three study areas to gather information<br />
relating to current sales trends, improvements<br />
carried out or planned, and opinions regarding<br />
ways of improving business.<br /><br />
Personal interviews were also carried out among<br />
merchants in the three areas to get a firsthand<br />
impression of their views on the business<br />
outlook, the effects of planned or proposed<br />
public activities such as mass transit and urban<br />
renewal, and' feasible recommendations for<br />
improving their area. It was also possible to<br />
obtain from this survey some idea of the degree<br />
of participation that could be expected in any<br />
improvement program.<br /><br />
Other factors considered in the survey were<br />
traffic and parking conditions, quality and type<br />
of merchandise, driving time to competing<br />
centers and general appearance of the study<br />
area.<br /><br />
Surveys were also conducted of residents of the<br />
trade areas of the three shopping centers to<br />
determine shopping habits and preferences,<br />
income and age groups, and attitudes toward<br />
the facilities or lack of them in the three areas.<br /><br />
The market studies showed that the three<br />
centers are highly dependent on the<br />
surrounding residential areas for their economic<br />
survival because most of their customers are<br />
those who can walk there to shop.<br /><br />
But family income is low, unemployment rates<br />
are high and there is steady decline in the<br /><br />
population of the three surrounding areas. All<br />
of these factors contribute to a declining<br />
market for the goods and services offered by<br />
business in the three centers.<br /><br />
The three areas differ in some of their<br />
socio-economic characteristics.<br /><br />
The Pennsylvania Avenue area, for example, is<br />
in a predominantly Black neighborhood and for<br />
many years was the main shopping area for<br />
most Black people in Baltimore. Local<br />
merchants indicated that many of their<br />
customers continued to shop in the<br />
Pennsylvania Avenue area after moving out of<br />
the neighborhood.<br /><br />
The core of the shopping area has no vacancies<br />
and higher than average sales volume. The<br />
public market plays an important role in the<br />
neighborhood and its sales figures amount to<br />
$93 per square foot, compared to $78 for other<br />
public markets.<br /><br />
Despite this, Pennsylvania Avenue merchants<br />
are losing their customers. Between 1950 and<br />
1960, the trade area population decreased by<br />
20 percent. Urban renewal clearance has since<br />
increased the downward trend. In addition,<br />
changes in social attitudes; €conomic gains and<br />
other factors have enabled many Black people<br />
to move to other parts of the city. Further<br />
clearance programs are expected to result in a<br />
further 23 percent decline in population by<br />
0.<br /><br />
The loss of customers and the continued<br />
prospect of further decreases have caused<br />
merchants--the majority of whom rent<br />
premises--to hesitate in making further financial<br />
commitments in the area.<br /><br />
The Light Street Area has no vacant stores in its<br />
retail core and higher than average sales<br />
volumes. There are vacant stores on the fringes<br />
of the area and some marginal stores along<br />
Charles Street. Although the public market<br />
occupies a prime location, it is not used to its<br />
fullest extent--27 percent of the stalls were<br /><br />
not rented at the time of this study.<br /><br />
The area’s population of 36,300 is primarily<br />
blue-collar workers and about one-third is<br />
Black. This results in merchants being faced<br />
with varying and sometimes conflictin<br /><br />
demands for goods and services. The population<br /><br /><br /><br />
decreased by 23 percent between 1950 aﬁd<br />
1960.<br /><br />
Problems in the Light Street area are not as<br />
evident as in the Pennsylvania Avenue area, but<br />
merchants are growing uncertain about the<br />
future and are less inclined to invest in<br />
improvements. Although the proposed Inner<br />
Harbor project will add more than 1,000<br />
dwelling units to the adjacent area, the<br />
merchants feel that because they will have<br />
higher incomes and because of the project’s<br />
proximity to the CBD, the new residents will<br />
shop elsewhere.<br /><br />
In contrast, Monument Street had a relatively<br />
stable population between 1950 and 1960; the<br />
median income was only slightly below the city<br />
average and unemployment was relatively<br />
moderate. The number of Black residents is<br />
gradually increasing and merchants indicated<br />
that their clientele is about evenly divided<br />
between white and Black.<br /><br />
Although vacancy rates are low in the core area,<br />
there are higher than average vacancies in the<br />
fringe areas of the shopping center. The public<br />
market occupies a prime location but 12<br />
percent of its space is not rented and sales<br />
volumes are low.<br /><br />
Expansion of Johns Hopkins Hospital facilities<br />
is expected to add several thousand employees<br />
and some permanent residents to the area.<br />
Projections indicate an increasing population<br />
but the shifting ethnic distribution may cause<br />
problems for merchants.<br />","1. Review and Analysis of Existing Studies<br />
Existing reports were examined to determine<br />
the present function of each area, the size and<br />
scope of its retail sector, characteristics of its<br />
trade area population, and prospective<br />
population and income levels. In addition, each<br />
area was evaluated in terms of special problems<br />
and assets.<br />
<br />
General data regarding the city and the region<br />
were examined as a framework for evaluating<br />
the market potential of the three areas. Any<br />
renewal activities, transportation proposals or<br />
similar programs were evaluated to determine<br />
their possible socio-economic effect on each<br />
area.<br />
<br />
2. Surveys<br />
<br />
A mail survey was conducted among merchants<br />
in the three study areas to gather information<br />
relating to current sales trends, improvements<br />
carried out or planned, and opinions regarding<br />
ways of improving business.<br />
<br />
Personal interviews were also carried out among<br />
merchants in the three areas to get a firsthand<br />
impression of their views on the business<br />
outlook, the effects of planned or proposed<br />
public activities such as mass transit and urban<br />
renewal, and' feasible recommendations for<br />
improving their area. It was also possible to<br />
obtain from this survey some idea of the degree<br />
of participation that could be expected in any<br />
improvement program.<br />

Preliminary planning concepts were developed<br />
at the earliest possible stage to enable<br />
merchants and city officials to discuss various<br />
alternatives for making improvements.<br /><br />
Preliminary concepts were based on an analysis<br />
of the findings of the research phase. These<br />
findings dealt with socio-economic<br />
characteristics, existing physical relationships,<br />
existing and proposed city programs an<br />
environmental problems in the three areas.<br /><br />
For clarity and ease of understanding during<br />
discussions with the various groups involved,<br />
the findings of the study at this stage and the<br />
implications drawn from them were<br />
summarized in tabular form, grouped according<br />
to the four categories shown above, and, with<br />
the exception of socio-economic characteristics,<br />
were also depicted graphically.<br /><br />
The findings and implications for each area are<br />
summarized on the following pages:<br /><br />
1. Pennsylvania Avenue Area<br /><br />
a. Socio-Economic Characteristics<br /><br />
The implication drawn from the finding that<br />
the trade area population is almost totally<br />
Black was that specialized treatment would be<br />
required for the retail core, taking into account<br />
the types of merchandise required and the<br />
concentration of a population that has<br />
relatively low income levels.<br /><br />
The high vacancy rates and declining<br />
population indicated a need to consolidate<br />
retail and service facilities and to either reduce<br />
retail floor space or increase the shopping area’s<br />
drawing power by carrying out dramatic<br />
improvements.<br /><br />
Pennsylvania Avenue has a strong retail core in<br />
the sector of the public market, while the<br />
weaker areas further away have suffered from<br />
increasing dilapidation.<br /><br />
b. Existing Physical Relationships<br /><br />
A major implication in this category deals with<br />
the need to avoid improvement programs that<br />
would reduce the area’s population still further<br />
by removing the multi-family dwellings that are<br />
predominant without replacing them with other<br />
types of housing.<br /><br />
The north-south street pattern, which serves as<br /><br />
a link between the central business district and<br />
outer areas, is a prime cause of congestion,<br />
indicating a need for an alternative route for<br />
such traffic. The length of the commercial strip<br />
development also indicates problems in<br />
providing adequate off-street parking.<br /><br />
c. Present City Program and Proposals<br /><br />
These include intensive rehabilitation under the<br />
Community Renewal Plan, additions to several<br />
public housing projects and a major freeway<br />
system, all of which will have a tendency to<br />
reduce the trade area population and therefore<br />
the potential for retail sales. In addition, a<br />
proposed rapid transit line proposed for a<br />
location a considerable distance away would<br />
tend to pull shoppers away from Pennsylvania<br />
Avenue.<br /><br />
The effect of other public programs of reducing<br />
the population could be offset if housing<br />
densities were increased in an extensive urban<br />
renewal program proposed for the lower end of<br />
Pennsylvania Avenue.<br /><br />
d. Environmental Problems<br /><br />
These dealt with the high incidence of<br />
substandard and deficient buildings, traffic,<br />
accumulation of junk and trash, the large<br />
number of narrow lots and consequently<br />
narrow stores and the extensive use of buildings<br />
for both retailing and residential purposes.<br /><br />
These findings indicated that extensive<br />
rehabilitation was unrealistic because of the<br />
high cost, and that with a consolidation of the<br />
retail core, the commercially deteriorated part<br />
of the linear strip could be used for<br />
high-density residential buildings. The findings<br />
also indicated that through traffic should be<br />
rerouted.<br /><br />
2. Light Street Area<br /><br />
a. Socio-Economic Characteristics<br /><br />
A declining population, relatively high<br />
unemployment rates and an increasing number<br />
of low-income Black people in the area is<br />
reducing purchasing power and causing<br />
conflicting demands for goods and services.<br /><br />
Despite a low vacancy rate, property values are<br />
dropping and improvements are not being<br />
made, indicating a declining position for the<br />
area as a retail shopping center. Ways must be<br />
found of strengthening the position of the<br /><br />
shopping area, including improving the |5qb|ic<br />
market.<br /><br />
b. Existing Physical Relationships<br /><br />
The trade area is essentially an enclave of<br />
owner-occupied row houses surrounded by<br />
industrial and wholesale activities. This will<br />
limit expansion of the trade area unless housing<br />
density is increased.<br /><br />
The location of the area has made it a corridor<br />
for north-south traffic which has had an adverse<br />
effect, and an east-west orientation seems<br />
desirable to conteract this effect. Existing<br />
physical relationships are shown in graphic<br />
form.<br /><br />
c. Present City Programs and Proposals<br /><br />
These include a major urban renewal project to<br />
the north, a major east-west expressway,<br />
extensive conservation and clearance programs<br />
in adjacent areas and a proposal to intensify<br />
industrial development in the area.<br /><br />
These proposals could have a beneficial effect if<br />
full consideration is given to the area’s<br />
potential. Otherwise, the area may increasingly<br />
become an isolated community surrounded by<br />
activities that do not benefit the shopping<br />
center or make use of its potentialities.<br /><br />
d. Environmental Problems<br /><br />
The extensive pockets of decay, both structural<br />
and functional, in the area provide prime<br />
targets for improvements that'would reduce the<br />
size of the commercial core and make it more<br />
compact.<br /><br />
Because of Light Street’s importance as a<br />
business street, traffic congestion should be<br />
eliminated by diverting through traffic to<br />
surrounding arterial roads. Trucks should be<br />
discouraged from using the streets in the area,<br />
possibly by improving alleyways and making<br />
them suitable for loading and unloading.<br /><br />
3. Monument Street Area<br /><br />
a. Socio-Economic Characteristics<br /><br />
A relatively stable population, average incomes<br />
and low vacancy rates compared to the other<br />
areas give Monument Street a brighter future.<br />
There is a need to reduce the amount of retail<br />
floor space available, concentrating on the core<br />
shopping area.<br />","V. Preliminary Planning<br />

ownership, there is less emphasis on walk-in<br />
trade and the need for off-street parking and<br />
improved traffic circulation is greater. The high<br />
proportion of owner-occupied stores, together<br />
with a high number of tenant-businessmen, will<br />
require a planning program that provides<br />
investment opportunities. Because of these<br />
factors, rehabilitation will take more time to<br />
accomplish, but should be economically<br />
feasible because of the condition of buildings.<br /><br />
The likelihood of only a moderate population<br />
Increase and a trend toward an increase in lower<br />
income families living in the area will make it<br />
necessary to strengthen the shopping area and<br />

b. Existing Physical Relationships<br />
The trade area consists mainly of single-family<br /><br />
row houses, with a few pockets of two-family<br />
and multi-family housing on the fringes. This<br />
points to the possibility of increasing<br />
population densities to create more market<br />

After discussion of the findings and<br />
implications of the study phase by<br />
representatives of merchants’ groups and city<br />
officials, planning objectives were developed to<br />
provide guidelines for overcoming some of the<br />
problems that were beginning to emerge.<br /><br />
The objectives were presented for discussion in<br />
tabular form for ease of comprehension. Each<br />
objective was accompanied by a list of<br />
considerations that would be necessary in<br />
achieving the objectives. They are summarized<br />
below:<br /><br />
1. Functional Use<br /><br />
The objectives were to strengthen the retail<br />
core, increase population density, provide for<br />
city and other governmental activities of a<br />
decentralized nature, and create open space for<br />
Its aesthetic value.<br /><br />
Among the considerations suggested for<br />
discussion were:<br /><br />
Contracting the retail area to shorten walking<br />
distances<br /><br />
Removing all conflicting nonretail uses<br /><br />
Provision of sites for multi-family housing and<br />
provision for residential units above new stores<br /><br />
Using air rights over existing commercial<br />
structures for multi-family residences<br /><br />
Reserving sites for such facilities as libraries,<br />
health and welfare centers and similar<br />
governmental offices<br /><br />
Creating open space by demolishing blighted<br />
buildings and by providing small courts<br />
between stores in selected locations.<br /><br />
2. Traffic and Circulation<br /><br />
Objectives were to minimize traffic congestion,<br />
improve access to retail cores, provide a<br />
pedestrian-way system and improve loading and<br />
unloading facilities.<br /><br />
Considerations suggested for discussion<br />
included:<br /><br />
Traffic loops around the retail cores<br /><br />
Direct connecting links between retail cores and<br /><br />
major thoroughfares and expressways<br />
Convenient access to public transit facilities<br /><br />
Use of public open space in the form of malls<br />
or small areas in conjunction with pedestrian<br />
pathways<br /><br />
Development of a system of serviceways giving<br />
access to the back entrances of commercial<br />
buildings.<br /><br />
3. Parking<br /><br />
Objectives were to provide adequate off-street<br />
parking in convenient locations and in harmony<br />
with other elements of the core areas, to relate<br />
the needs of moving traffic to the use of streets<br />
for parking purposes and to restrict on-street<br />
parking space to short-term parking.<br /><br />
Considerations were related to distribution of<br />
parking spaces, their type, financing, visual<br />
appearance, and locational considerations and<br />
included:<br /><br />
Large off-street parking areas on the edge or in<br /><br />
the middle of the retail ccres, depending on<br />
circumstances<br /><br />
Surface lots or underground or above-ground<br />
structures, depending on demand, availability<br />
of land and financing, with consideration given<br />
to assembling surface areas for later<br />
development with structures<br /><br />
Various types of financing<br />
Convenient and attractive design<br /><br />
Connections between pedestrian passageways<br />
and parking areas<br /><br />
On-street parking limited to fringe areas<br />
surrounding core and allowed only during<br />
off-peak hours.<br /><br />
4. Visual Appearance<br /><br />
The objective was to create a visual<br />
environment easily identifiable with each area<br />
and related to a central design theme.<br /><br />
Considerations were:<br /><br />
Special types of lighting<br /><br />
19<br /><br />
Uniform sign system<br /><br />
Street furniture designed for its specific usé and<br />
location<br /><br />
Coordinated color scheme for restoration and<br />
rehabilitation<br /><br />
Coordinated landscaping<br /><br />
5. Design Theme<br />
The objective was to achieve a coordinated and<br />
unifying design theme for each retail core area.<br /><br />
Considerations included:<br /><br />
A central design theme to create a visual<br />
environment readily identifiable and which<br />
would have a unifying effect<br /><br />
Use of unique symbols signifying different<br />
types of stores.<br /><br />
6. Public Markets<br /><br />
The objective was to develop the public<br />
markets as focal points and attractions.<br />
Considerations included:<br /><br />
More attractive facades and landscaping of<br />
market buildings and sites<br /><br />
Six-day weekly operation and improved<br />
shopping facilities<br /><br />
A merchants’ cooperative which could lease<br />
premises and be responsible for maintenance,<br />
promotion and merchandising<br /><br />
Redesign of market buildings to permit outdoor<br />
operation in suitable weather<br /><br />
Use of market buildings as accommodation for<br />
merchants forced to move because of<br />
improvement program<br /><br />
7. Elimination of Blight<br /><br />
The objective was to demolish all structures<br />
that could not be rehabilitated economically--<br />
except buildings of historic or architectural<br />
significance--and use the land for new facilities<br />
in keeping with the improvement program.<br /><br />
Considerations suggested for discussion<br />

In developing the goals and planning objectives<br />

core areas served as focal points in their<br />
communities as well as local centers for<br />
shopping and other services.<br /><br /><br /><br />

where people meet and mingle in a variety of<br />
social activities. They form part of a general<br />
group of facilities and services which people in<br />
cities need and depend upon.<br /><br />
As a result of these considerations, a further<br />
broad objective was developed which was not<br />
provided for in the more functional objectives<br />
listed. This was the development of these core<br />
areas to the fullest degree as focal points of<br />
neighborhood activity. This objective was<br />
emphasized in preparing design plans for the<br />
three areas and in recommending activities<br />
which could be incorporated into them.<br /><br />

1. Pennsylvania Avenue Area<br /><br />
The Concept Plan alternates provided for the<br />
reduction of existing retail floor space,<br />
improved traffic circulation, substantially<br />
increased parking facilities, improved pedestrian<br />
circulation and an expanded role for the public<br />
market.<br /><br />
Alternative methods of achieving the concept<br />
plans were explored utilizing rehabilitation<br />
methods. However, because of the extensive<br />
dilapidation in the area, even a limited<br />
rehabilitation program would not be<br />
economically feasible and would not amount to<br />
much more than a paint-up, fix-up, clean-up<br />
effort.<br /><br />
A more attractive alternative would be the<br />
creation of a Town Center through a major<br />
renewal program. This could become one of the<br />
most improtant projects undertaken by the<br />
city, to demonstrate that a retail shopping core<br />
of this kind can be revitalized. It could become<br />
the cornerstone for all future redevelopment<br />
efforts in this area.<br /><br />
The Town Center could be designed to provide<br />
a broad range of community services and<br />
facilities, including health; welfare and<br />
education. In addition to up-to-date shopping<br />
facilities with adequate parking facilities, it<br />
could make available facilities for social,<br />
cultural, and similar community activities for<br />
various age groups. Provisions for business and<br />
professional offices and for governmental<br />
activities in the Town Center would increase<br />
employment opportunities in the area.<br /><br />
Many of the facilities now in the trade area<br />
could be consolidated into the Town Center,<br />
freeing land for housing.<br /><br />
The Town Center could serve as a focal point<br />
for services and facilities provided by the city<br />
and other public agencies to residents in the<br />
area. In developing it to serve a wide range of<br />
activities, local citizens should be involved in<br />
the initial planning phases so that the center is<br />
designed to serve their needs.<br /><br />
2. Light Street Area<br />
Concept plans were directed to consolidating<br />
the retail core, increasing residential densities<br /><br />
around the retail core, improving traffic and<br />
pedestrian circulation, improving the public<br />
market and providing more off-street parking.<br /><br />
3. Monument Street Area<br /><br />
Concept plans specified reducing the retail floor<br />
space in the area, improving traffic circulation<br />
and parking, and providing a series of open<br />
corridors and plazas, connected by pedestrian<br />
ways. One important element was to shift the<br />
geographic center of the retail core closer to the<br />
Johns Hopkins Hospital. Another was to<br />
increase residential densities in or near the<br />
study area. In addition, ways of using the<br />
public market area to greater advantage were<br />
explored.<br /><br />
4. Feasibility of Rehabilitation<br /><br />
As part of the preliminary planning stage, the<br />
cost of rehabilitating buildings in the three<br />
study areas was studied, based on an analysis of<br />
improvements carried out by merchants in the<br />
previous five years. This information was<br />
obtained from the merchants’ survey and the<br />
building conditions’ survey.<br /><br />
Ninty-nine merchants reported spending<br />
significant sums since 1961 on improvements to<br />
premises they occupied. Using selected<br />
examples, unit costs for rehabilitation were<br />
developed, based on the condition of the<br />
structure. Costs averaged between $1 per square<br />
foot for correcting deficiencies in a building<br />
rated as standard and $12 a square foot for a<br />
substandard building. Where storefront<br />
modernization took place, the unit cost was<br />
even higher.<br /><br />
Cost estimates were applied to 12 buildings in<br />
each area. |t was assumed that rehabilitation<br />
efforts would be confined to the first floor,<br />
that the front facade would be renovated and<br />
that the building would be used for retailing.<br />
Estimated costs were applied uniformly to all<br />
buildings regardless of the existing state of<br />
storefront modernization. This was done to<br />
provide a uniform base to determine whether a<br />
reasonable range of costs could be arrived at for<br />
the level of rehabilitation anticipated in the<br />
Improvement program.<br /><br /><br />","VIl. Concept Plans<br />

These figures were compared to property values<br />
and a ratio established. Assuming an average<br />
property value of $10,000 and using this ratio,<br />
costs were estimated for the rehabilitation of a<br />
commercial building in keeping with the goals<br />
of the program. By categories of deficiency, the<br />
following average costs were derived:<br /><br />
Standard $ 4,200<br />
Deficient - 1st degree $ 6,500<br />
Deficient - 2nd degree $12,100<br /><br />
Substandard $16,200<br /><br />

relationship between the size of the business,<br />
building condition or assessed value, and the<br />
amount spent on rehabilitation improvements.<br />
Rehabilitation had been undertaken or was<br />
being considered even with buildings in poor or<br />
bad condition.<br /><br />
It was concluded that the question of whether<br />
rehabilitation could be considered feasible<br />
could not be readily resolved. The extent to<br />
which an owner or merchant would be willing<br />
to invest further sums in a property appeared to<br />
rest primarily on three factors: his financial<br />
capability to undertake rehabilitation, the<br />
competitive position of the business and the<br />
anticipated return on his investment.<br /><br />
Other considerations which appeared to<br />
influence the decision to undertake<br />
rehabilitation were examined. They included a<br />
number of individual factors, such as whether<br /><br />
the building was owned or rented, whether it<br />
was a chain store or locally owned, the location<br />
of the business and the effect of competition<br />
and the availability of financing.<br /><br />
The merchant considering rehabilitation may<br />
also be influenced in his decision if a strong<br />
improvement program is contemplated<br />
throughout his area. With group participation<br />
by merchants, a snowballing effect is likely to<br />
take place resulting in rehabilitation being<br />
undertaken by more merchants. An areawide<br />
improvement program could also offer the<br />
attractions of city assistance, additional loan<br />
sources and improved enforcement of codes<br />
and ordinances.<br /><br />

VIll. Recommended Development Plans<br /><br />
1. Introduction<br /><br />
Planning recommendations and development<br />
plans for each of the three study areas were<br />
prepared following discussion of the various<br />
alternatives by merchant groups representing<br />
the three areas, city agencies and the Mayor's<br />
Advisory Committee on Small Business.<br /><br />
This represented the first phase of finalizing<br />
and coordinating the various studies. The<br />
recommended plans were accompanied by a<br />
report on design themes and an action program<br />
for carrying out the recommendations.<br /><br />
2. Planning Recommendations and<br />
Development Plans<br /><br />
Plan recommendations dealt with proposals for<br />
land use, traffic and community facilities.<br />
Development plans described the possible<br />
staging of urban renewal projects where these<br />
appeared feasible, and provided cost estimates<br />
for various public improvements, private<br />
rehabilitation and new construction. The<br />
development plans also suggested the types of<br />
new enterprises or facilities that could<br />
complement the existing retail core in each<br />
study area.<br /><br />
A prime purpose of the proposals was to<br />
provide a basis for the total rehabilitation of<br />
each area with relation to specific objectives.<br />
They provide a framework for unified action by<br />
all concerned with the rehabilitation and<br />
improvement program.<br /><br />
Plan proposals were related to planning<br />
objectives and presented in tabular form. They<br />
were accompanied by graphic illustrations of<br />
various plan elements.<br /><br />
The recommendations and plans for each study<br />
area follow:<br /><br />
a. Pennsylvania Avenue Area<br /><br />
The Pennsylvania Avenue plan calls for a major<br />
effort leading not only to rehabilitation but to<br />
the redevelopment of the shopping core. For<br />
that reason, two concepts were preparad, one<br />
considerably larger in scope than the other.<br />
Although the plan for this area suggests a<br />
combination of rehabilitation and<br />
redevelopment, it would be possible to achieve<br />
its objectives through rehabilitation alone, but<br />
over a much longer time. It might also result in<br /><br />
27<br /><br />
the primary objective--the creation of a Tdvyn<br />
Center--not being achieved. ;<br /><br />
The Town Center concept envisages the<br />
creation of a neighborhood focal point as a<br />
center for shopping, community services and<br />
social activity. The plan separates pedestrians<br />
and automobiles by providing pedestrian-ways,<br />
connecting plazas, arcades and shopping areas.<br />
For automobiles, there are convenient parking<br />
lots on the edge of the core area and there are<br />
lanes provided to provide access to buildings in<br />
the core area. Residential buildings are provided<br />
for in the core area to contribute to the vitality<br />
of the unified Town Center and take full<br />
advantage of the convenience of concentrated<br />
services.<br /><br />
b. Light Street Area<br /><br />
The public market was selected as the focal<br />
point and center of activities in the Light Street<br />
area. The market area would help unify the<br />
retail core and identify it as the central point<br />
for traffic approaching from north and south.<br /><br />
The shopping area was proposed as a compact<br /><br />
"" center surrounded by residential and office<br /><br />
uses, possibly in multi-use buildings. The<br />
market area would be converted into a<br />
pedestrian plaza and linked by pedestrian ways<br />
to parking areas and shopping arcades in<br />
mid-block locations.<br /><br />
A loop system would direct traffic around the<br />
retail core and be joined to a one-way street<br />
system linking the area with major traffic<br />
routes passing through the area.<br /><br />
The recommendations also included provision<br />
for such facilities as a branch library, and health<br />
and welfare offices serving the neighborhood.<br /><br />
c. Monument Street Area<br /><br />
To take advantage of the proximity of the<br />
Johns Hopkins Hospital complex, a<br />
concentration of core uses closer to the<br />
Hospital was recommended as part of the<br />
process of creating a more compact retail<br />
shopping area. This link between the retail core<br />
and the hospital would be further strengthened<br />
by providing for multi-use buildings<br />
surrounding a pedestrian plaza with retail stores<br />
on the ground floor. The same area was also<br />
suggested as the location for bus and subways<br />
stops.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"," <br />

VIll. Recommended Development Plans<br />
<br />
1. Introduction<br />
<br />
Planning recommendations and development<br />
plans for each of the three study areas were<br />
prepared following discussion of the various<br />
alternatives by merchant groups representing<br />
the three areas, city agencies and the Mayor's<br />
Advisory Committee on Small Business.<br />
<br />
This represented the first phase of finalizing<br />
and coordinating the various studies. The<br />
recommended plans were accompanied by a<br />
report on design themes and an action program<br />
for carrying out the recommendations.<br />
<br />
2. Planning Recommendations and<br />
Development Plans<br />
<br />
Plan recommendations dealt with proposals for<br />
land use, traffic and community facilities.<br />
Development plans described the possible<br />
staging of urban renewal projects where these<br />
appeared feasible, and provided cost estimates<br />
for various public improvements, private<br />
rehabilitation and new construction. The<br />
development plans also suggested the types of<br />
new enterprises or facilities that could<br />
complement the existing retail core in each<br />
study area.<br />
<br />
A prime purpose of the proposals was to<br />
provide a basis for the total rehabilitation of<br />
each area with relation to specific objectives.<br />

Another plaza was recommended in the area of<br />
the public market and pedestrian ways would<br />
link the two plazas as well as other parts of the<br />
core. A traffic loop system was suggested to<br />
eliminate or reduce congestion combined with a<br />
one-way street system in and adjacent to the<br />
core. The provision of space for public agencies<br />
serving the area was also recommended.<br /><br />
3. Staging Possibilities<br /><br />
A suggested program for staging the<br />
recommended improvements was presented in<br />
graphic form for each study area. Priorities<br />
were selected on the basis of improvements:<br /><br />
That were primarily rehabilitation<br /><br />
That resulted in maximum improvement with<br />
minimum disruption of existing buildings<br /><br />
That resulted in objectives being more easily<br />
attained<br /><br />
That cost less in relationship to the benefits<br />
gained<br /><br />
That provided maximum benefit to existing<br />
businesses<br /><br />
That could be carried out without federal urban<br />
renewal aid and with relatively low financial aid<br />
from the city<br /><br />
That required a minimum financial<br />
commitment of property owners.<br /><br />
4. Cost Elements<br /><br />
It was considered unrealistic to prepare detailed<br />
cost estimates for improvements in each area<br />
because of the large number of unknown<br />
factors. As guidelines, however, unit costs were<br />
estimated which would enable involved groups<br />
to prepare cost estimates of proposed<br />
Improvements.<br /><br />
Unit costs were given for new construction,<br />
including apartments, office buildings, retail<br />
buildings, parking lot development, street and<br />
sidewalk improvements, construction of<br />
pedestrian malls and landscaping.<br /><br />
5. Design Considerations<br /><br />
An important aspect of the study was the<br />
development of design themes for the three<br />
study areas to indicate factors that should be<br />
considered in any improvement programs and<br />
to show by graphic illustration some examples<br />
of the effects of good design treatment.<br /><br />
A variety of techniques was used which could<br />
be applied to any one of the three areas.<br />
Examples of blockfront treatment, showing<br />
before and after effects, were shown to<br />
demonstrate that the visual image of an area<br />
could be changed considerably with little effort<br />
or expense. Also illustrated was a variety of<br />
designs for street furniture such as light<br />
standards, directional signs, seating and<br />
fountains.<br /><br />
29<br /><br />
Illustrative plans for showing possible treatment<br />
of plaza areas were included to demonstrate the<br />
wide range of possibilities even in limited or<br />
confined areas.<br /><br />
6. Utilization of Urban Renewal<br /><br />
Factors to be considered if urban renewal<br />
projects were utilized to carry out the planning<br />
proposals for the three study areas were<br />
examined. They included the eligibility of<br />
possible project areas, costs, extent and<br />
proposed use of land to be made available for<br />
new development, and relocation requirements.<br /><br />
The review did not attempt to determine<br />
whether urban renewal should or should not be<br />
used but was intended to outline the scope and<br />
extent of work and expense connected with<br />
large-scale renewal programs.<br /><br />
Suggested boundaries for urban renewal project<br />
areas were described within the three areas. A<br />
review of survey data indicated that the three<br />
areas were eligible for urban renewal assistance<br />
in terms of blight and environmental<br />
deficiencies. Estimates were made of relocation<br />
requirements in each area. Cost estimates<br />
ranged from $2.6 million for a minimum area in<br />
the Monument Street area to $14 million for<br />
part of the Pennsylvania Avenue area. Costs<br />
were broken down to show gross and net<br />
project costs and the estimated local and<br />
federal shares, based on a 25% local<br />
contribution.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"," <br />
<br />
Another plaza was recommended in the area of<br />
the public market and pedestrian ways would<br />

possible project areas, costs, extent and<br />
proposed use of land to be made available for<br />
new development, and relocation requirements.<br />
<br />
The review did not attempt to determine<br />
whether urban renewal should or should not be<br />
used but was intended to outline the scope and<br />
extent of work and expense connected with<br />
large-scale renewal programs.<br />
<br />
Suggested boundaries for urban renewal project<br />
areas were described within the three areas. A<br />
review of survey data indicated that the three<br />
areas were eligible for urban renewal assistance<br />
in terms of blight and environmental<br />
deficiencies. Estimates were made of relocation<br />
requirements in each area. Cost estimates<br />
ranged from $2.6 million for a minimum area in<br />
the Monument Street area to $14 million for<br />
part of the Pennsylvania Avenue area. Costs<br />
were broken down to show gross and net<br />
project costs and the estimated local and<br />
federal shares, based on a 25% local<br />
contribution.<br />

IX. Recommendations for Action<br /><br />
1. Search for Identity<br /><br />
The solutions recommended for the three study<br />
areas are clearly more than a paint-up, fix-up or<br />
cosmetic approach. The answers lie in a<br />
restructuring of the role of each area as the<br />
multi-purpose center of each community.<br /><br />
The official city plan, however, does not<br />
recognize the problem of deteriorating<br />
neighborhood shopping centers as a<br />
community-oriented one in terms of the urban<br />
structure. Designated as no more than retail<br />
shopping areas, the centers are certain to<br />
continue deteriorating in the face of<br />
competition from suburban shopping centers,<br />
lack of public improvements and the general<br />
decay of the physical and social environment,<br /><br />
The centers need an identity around which a<br />
community can prosper. With such an identity,<br />
both the center and the community it serves<br />
would benefit from increased recognition and<br />
private investment. In search of an identity, it<br />
was concluded that the multi-purpose role of<br />
each center could be enhanced by:<br /><br />
Providing a stop (subway or bus) within it of<br />
the new proposed rapid mass transit system<br /><br />
Providing residenfial units for young people and<br />
the elderly<br /><br />
Providing a strong physical relationship to<br />
existing institutions (e.g., Johns Hopkins<br />
Hospital in the Monument Street Area).<br /><br />
These objectives and the needs of the existing<br />
and potential commercial establishments can be<br />
met physically, as described in the plan<br />
proposals, by such devices as:<br /><br />
Using lofts and unused spaces above stores<br />
more efficiently<br /><br />
Using air rights above parking lots and other<br />
spaces for high-rise development<br /><br />
Opening up malls and plazas to relate to<br />
commercial establishments<br /><br />
Combining public and private use in one<br />
structure<br /><br />
None of these proposals, however, is feasible<br />
within the current image of the shopping areas.<br /><br />
Many of the individual store owners are<br />
wrestling with marginal businesses. The city is<br />
heavily committed elsewhere and private<br />
investors have shown little interest in these<br />
older shopping centers.<br /><br />
Significant change is, therefore, unlikely<br />
without the introduction of a broader concept<br />
of the use and the value of these centers.<br /><br />
2. Commitments to Revitalization<br /><br />
If the community center concept is to be<br />
realized, certain commitments to the three<br />
areas must be recognized by:<br /><br />
a. City of Baltimore<br /><br />
The City of Baltimore is faced with a<br />
tremendous backlog of work in the public<br />
sector. Higher priorities for the use of federal<br />
funds for urban renewal programs have been<br />
established for other areas of the city, including<br />
the central business district, the port area and<br />
highly concentrated residential slums.<br /><br />
In terms of city policy, the three shopping<br />
centers have not been singled out for any<br />
special attention, except that they--along with<br />
similar older neighborhood shopping areas--have<br />
been identified in the city's.Community<br />
Renewal Program, together with their<br />
boundaries, trading areas and parking<br />
requirements.<br /><br />
The city should recognize the role of these<br />
areas as community centers, as focal points of<br />
their respective neighborhoods. With this<br />
recognition must come commitments in the<br />
form of policies which will bolster and expand<br />
the role of the existing shopping areas as<br />
community centers. The city must accept the<br />
idea that the central business district in as large<br />
a metropolitan area as Baltimore cannot alone<br />
serve the entire shopping needs of the city and<br />
the surrounding region, and that properly<br />
organized and well-functioning community<br />
centers will enable the CBD to perform its true<br />
role as the center of a large region, containing<br />
the commercial, social and cultural amenities<br />
required by a large population.<br /><br />
To accept this concept will require acceptance<br />
of the idea that proposals to expand and<br />
strengthen the smaller community centers such<br />
as the three under study will not have a harmful<br />
effect on the central business district.<br /><br />
31<br /><br />
It will require the formulation of transportation<br />
plans that recognize the community center\as<br />
the focal point of the surrounding area. It will<br />
require action which will lead to the<br />
establishment of post offices, libraries, health<br />
services and other community facilities and<br />
activities within the new Town Center. It will<br />
require zoning and other planning policies<br />
which permit increased residential densities in<br />
and around the commercial cores and the<br />
development of air rights over existing<br />
properties.<br /><br />
Perhaps more significantly than any other<br />
point, it will require acceptance of the idea that<br />
the city should work to establish these centers<br />
as centers of interest for the surrounding<br />
population. Despite the possibility of criticism<br />
that this policy will increase segregation and<br />
perpetuate ghettos, the concept of a strong<br />
focal point is valid and important in giving<br />
identity, vitality and common meaning to an<br />
area, regardless of whether it is predominantly<br />
populated by white people or nonwhite people.<br /><br />
“ b. Community<br /><br />
The commitment of community residents to<br />
the concept of a strengthened community<br />
center is difficult to analyze and project. The<br />
obvious commitment is illustrated by the high<br />
percentage of walk-in trade patronizing retail<br />
establishments in the three areas. The residents<br />
of the community surrounding each shopping<br />
center need the facilities provided and would<br />
presumably patronize a better-organized<br />
community center more if it provided an<br />
expanded range of goods and services and a<br />
host of community programs and services.<br /><br />
In discussing concept plans with neighborhood<br />
residents, it was found that there was very little<br />
dialogue between the merchants and the<br />
surrounding residents. There was some<br />
resentment, in fact, to the proposals to create<br />
better parking facilities. This resulted from the<br />
attitude that better housing facilities were of<br />
more importance than parking facilities.<br /><br />
Community residents should be able to identify<br />
their self-interests with that of the center’s and<br />
to participate in decisions affecting its future,<br />
which could lead to job training programs and<br />
more employment opportunities in addition to<br />
an improved center.<br /><br /><br />"," <br />

c. Merchants<br /><br />
The relatively low percentage of merchants who<br />
own their properties makes it difficult to<br />
encourage improvements that would enhance<br />
the area and contribute to the concept of an<br />
active and viable Town Center.<br /><br />
To the extent that the merchants are highly<br />
dependent on the surrounding neighborhood<br />
for their livelihood, they are committed to its<br />
future. This commitment should be expanded<br />
and deepened in the formulation of plans for<br />
the creation of community centers by<br />
encouraging the participation of merchants in<br />
the decision-making process and providing<br />
opportunities for them to improve their<br />
premises.<br /><br />
d. Property Owners<br /><br />
Property owners fall into two<br /><br />
categories: Those who operate businesses in<br />
the shopping centers and those who rent their<br />
buildings to others. It is reasonable to presume<br />
that those who conduct business in their own<br />
premises have a higher degree of commitment<br />
to the area than absentee landlords.<br /><br />
If the community center concept is to be<br />
successfully implemented, property owners will<br />
have to make'a heavier commitment to the<br />
centers in which their properties are located.<br />
This commitment can take the form of<br />
participation in new investment programs<br />
organized by groups of merchants and owners<br />
banding together, and in other community<br />
groups that recognize the community interest<br />
and work on its behalf. The commitment will<br />
also require improvements to property within<br />
the framework of a general plan of<br />
rehabilitation<br /><br />
3. Need for Cooperation<br /><br />
The program for the improvement of the<br />
demonstration areas is designed, in part, to<br />
establish new patterns of cooperation at the<br />
city level among private enterprise, local<br />
merchants, public agencies, and local residents.<br />
Cooperative planning and program<br />
implementation among these groups is<br />
proposed to achieve the following major<br />
objectives:<br /><br />
To provide the private retail and service<br />
facilities that reflect the consumer needs of<br />
local residents.<br /><br /><br /><br />
To promote maximum local community<br />
identification with the use of the shopping<br />
facilities.<br /><br />
To create a viable center of community interest<br />
and activity as well as an economically<br />
successful shopping center.<br /><br />
To create a functionally and physically<br />
attractive asset in the overall neighborhood<br />
rehabilitation program area.<br /><br />
To generate the maximum renewal of<br />
productive investment and employrmient<br />
opportunities for local residents.<br /><br />
To increase the assessable real estate tax base.<br /><br />
a. Citizens Advisory Council<br /><br />
Based on these objectives, it is essential that<br />
communication with and participation of<br />
neighborhood groups and individuals be<br />
initiated early in the formulation of a<br />
development program. Neighborhood<br />
participation should perhaps be formalized into<br />
a citizens advisory council with a clearly<br /><br />
delineated role in the formulation of policy and<br /><br />
program proposals.<br /><br />
Based on the findings, analyses and conclusions<br />
of this study, a citizens advisory council can be<br />
provided with an adequate basis for discussing<br />
and contributing to major aspects of the<br />
rehabilitation program. A program of<br />
neighborhood participation would be an<br />
excellent vehicle for identifying neighborhood<br />
needs and attitudes that bear on<br />
implementation of the rehabilitation program.<br />
Moreover, this type of neighborhood<br />
participation is likely to offer an effective<br />
approach to dissemination of information to<br />
neighborhood residents.<br /><br />
b. Small Business Commission<br /><br />
Within the existing framework of city<br />
government, there is a need for an agency<br />
directly concerned with the activities of small<br />
businessmen within the community. A small<br />
business commission with the necessary staff<br />
could undertake certain important activities. It<br />
could receive funds from the city government<br />
for its operation, solicit funds from private<br />
individuals or negotiate with other government<br />
agencies at the federal or state level to carry out<br />
programs.<br /><br />
By creating a Small Business Commission<br />
(SBC), the city would be accepting the<br />
responsibility for providing the needed<br />
leadership. An SBC would:<br /><br />
Provide managerial training for small<br />
businessmen<br /><br />
Become a clearinghouse for financial guidance<br />
and assistance<br /><br />
Aid in loan application processing<br /><br />
Provide technical and other assistance in the<br />
rehabilitation or construction of commercial<br />
facilities and structures<br /><br />
Develop plans and programs for areas<br />
containing primarily retailing and commercial<br />
establishments<br /><br />
Coordinate its planning activities with those of<br />
other city agencies<br /><br />
Coordinate development pfograms within<br />
specified planning areas with other city agencies<br />
providing supporting facilities and services<br /><br />
Provide fegal services to groups of merchants or<br />
property owners banding together to form a<br />
development corporation’ . A<br /><br />
Suggest to City Council legislation needed to<br />
carry out its programs<br /><br />
In general, serve as liaison between the small<br />
business community and city, state and federal<br />
agencies<br /><br />
Every aspect of program initiation and<br />
execution proposed in this study should be<br />
carried out in close collaboration with<br />
neighborhood groups.<br /><br />
4. Employment Opportunities<br /><br />
While it was outside the scope of the study to<br />
discuss job opportunities for neighborhood<br />
residents, it would be a severe oversight to<br />
ignore this aspect of the potential program. The<br />
success of the rehabilitation program would be<br />
measurably improved by the creation of new<br />
employment opportunities in the study areas.<br />
Thus, there should be provision for generating<br />
employment opportunities relating to existing<br />
or proposed training programs.<br /><br />
a0<br /><br /><br />","32<br />
<br />
c. Merchants<br />
<br />
The relatively low percentage of merchants who<br />
own their properties makes it difficult to<br />
encourage improvements that would enhance<br />
the area and contribute to the concept of an<br />
active and viable Town Center.<br />
<br />
To the extent that the merchants are highly<br />
dependent on the surrounding neighborhood<br />
for their livelihood, they are committed to its<br />
future. This commitment should be expanded<br />
and deepened in the formulation of plans for<br />
the creation of community centers by<br />
encouraging the participation of merchants in<br />
the decision-making process and providing<br />
opportunities for them to improve their<br />
premises.<br />
<br />
d. Property Owners<br />
<br />
Property owners fall into two<br />
<br />
categories: Those who operate businesses in<br />
the shopping centers and those who rent their<br />
buildings to others. It is reasonable to presume<br />
that those who conduct business in their own<br />
premises have a higher degree of commitment<br />
to the area than absentee landlords.<br />
<br />
If the community center concept is to be<br />
successfully implemented, property owners will<br />
have to make'a heavier commitment to the<br />
centers in which their properties are located.<br />
This commitment can take the form of<br />
participation in new investment programs<br />
organized by groups of merchants and owners<br />
banding together, and in other community<br />
groups that recognize the community interest<br />
and work on its behalf. The commitment will<br />
also require improvements to property within<br />
the framework of a general plan of<br />
rehabilitation<br />
<br />
3. Need for Cooperation<br />
<br />
The program for the improvement of the<br />
demonstration areas is designed, in part, to<br />
establish new patterns of cooperation at the<br />
city level among private enterprise, local<br />
merchants, public agencies, and local residents.<br />
Cooperative planning and program<br />
implementation among these groups is<br />
proposed to achieve the following major<br />
objectives:<br />
<br />
To provide the private retail and service<br />
facilities that reflect the consumer needs of<br />
local residents.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
To promote maximum local community<br />
identification with the use of the shopping<br />
facilities.<br />
<br />
To create a viable center of community interest<br />
and activity as well as an economically<br />
successful shopping center.<br />
<br />
To create a functionally and physically<br />
attractive asset in the overall neighborhood<br />
rehabilitation program area.<br />
<br />
To generate the maximum renewal of<br />
productive investment and employrmient<br />
opportunities for local residents.<br />
<br />
To increase the assessable real estate tax base.<br />
<br />
a. Citizens Advisory Council<br />
<br />
Based on these objectives, it is essential that<br />
communication with and participation of<br />
neighborhood groups and individuals be<br />
initiated early in the formulation of a<br />
development program. Neighborhood<br />
participation should perhaps be formalized into<br />
a citizens advisory council with a clearly<br />
<br />
delineated role in the formulation of policy and<br />
<br />
program proposals.<br />
<br />
Based on the findings, analyses and conclusions<br />
of this study, a citizens advisory council can be<br />
provided with an adequate basis for discussing<br />
and contributing to major aspects of the<br />
rehabilitation program. A program of<br />
neighborhood participation would be an<br />
excellent vehicle for identifying neighborhood<br />
needs and attitudes that bear on<br />
implementation of the rehabilitation program.<br />
Moreover, this type of neighborhood<br />
participation is likely to offer an effective<br />
approach to dissemination of information to<br />
neighborhood residents.<br />
<br />
b. Small Business Commission<br />
<br />
Within the existing framework of city<br />
government, there is a need for an agency<br />
directly concerned with the activities of small<br />
businessmen within the community. A small<br />
business commission with the necessary staff<br />
could undertake certain important activities. It<br />
could receive funds from the city government<br />
for its operation, solicit funds from private<br />
individuals or negotiate with other government<br />
agencies at the federal or state level to carry out<br />
programs.<br />
<br />
By creating a Small Business Commission<br />
(SBC), the city would be accepting the<br />
responsibility for providing the needed<br />
leadership. An SBC would:<br />
<br />
Provide managerial training for small<br />
businessmen<br />
<br />
Become a clearinghouse for financial guidance<br />
and assistance<br />
<br />
Aid in loan application processing<br />
<br />
Provide technical and other assistance in the<br />
rehabilitation or construction of commercial<br />
facilities and structures<br />
<br />
Develop plans and programs for areas<br />
containing primarily retailing and commercial<br />
establishments<br />
<br />
Coordinate its planning activities with those of<br />
other city agencies<br />
<br />
Coordinate development pfograms within<br />
specified planning areas with other city agencies<br />
providing supporting facilities and services<br />
<br />
Provide fegal services to groups of merchants or<br />
property owners banding together to form a<br />
development corporation’ . A<br />
<br />
Suggest to City Council legislation needed to<br />
carry out its programs<br />
<br />
In general, serve as liaison between the small<br />
business community and city, state and federal<br />
agencies<br />
<br />
Every aspect of program initiation and<br />
execution proposed in this study should be<br />
carried out in close collaboration with<br />
neighborhood groups.<br />
<br />
4. Employment Opportunities<br />
<br />
While it was outside the scope of the study to<br />
discuss job opportunities for neighborhood<br />
residents, it would be a severe oversight to<br />
ignore this aspect of the potential program. The<br />
success of the rehabilitation program would be<br />
measurably improved by the creation of new<br />
employment opportunities in the study areas.<br />
Thus, there should be provision for generating<br />
employment opportunities relating to existing<br />
or proposed training programs.<br />

Information on such programs should be<br />
disseminated to participating neighborhood<br />
groups which, in turn, would spread<br />
information to local residents, relating training<br />
needs and opportunities to projected or<br />
available jobs. Many of the training activities<br />
could be conducted under MDTA's On-the-Job<br />
Training Program supplemented by classroom<br />
training and related basic education.<br /><br />
5. Air Rights Housing<br /><br />
In implementing the community concept, the<br />
provision of housing is of prime importance.<br />
Consideration should be given to the use of air<br />
rights over existing and new commercial<br />
buildings for this housing in a similar way that<br />
air rights over railroads and highways have been<br />
used for this and other types of development.<br /><br />
There are major advantages to using this<br />
important resource:<br /><br />
The community centers would be ideal<br />
locations for housing for such groups as the<br />
elderly and young couples. They have a full<br />
array of shopping; they offer employment<br />
opportunities; they are generally close to other<br /><br /><br /><br />
public facilities; and they are activity areas<br />
without the very high degree of movement and<br />
activities associated with the central business<br />
district.<br /><br />
Land for development is already available in the<br />
form of existing parking lots or will be acquired<br />
for this purpose in the future. This land can be<br />
used for the future development of the air<br />
rights over it and one of the objectives of<br />
acquiring land for parking should be to create a<br />
landbank. There may be no existing legal basis<br />
for using land acquired for parking for other<br />
uses, but this is a matter that could be dealt<br />
with thorugh appropriate legislative action.<br /><br />
Most business uses in the neighborhood<br />
shopping areas need only a single floor. Upper<br />
floors that are used for storage, run-down<br />
rooming units, or are unused could be sheared<br />
off and the air rights used for other<br />
development. Further engineering and<br />
architectural studies would be necessary to<br />
accomplish this. Another method would involve<br />
the reconstruction of buildings containing<br />
stores on the ground level, and residential<br />
accommodation above.<br /><br />
30<br /><br />
Whichever procedure is followed, the air rights<br />
over these small business areas representa<br />
valuable city resource and should be more fully<br />
utilized than has generally been the case in the<br />
past. In undertaking such development over<br />
parking and shopping areas, it becomes<br />
relatively easy to keep all service facilities<br />
below grade, with the residential structures<br />
rising from a platform that may have sitting<br />
areas, play space, a garden, a swimming pool<br />
and similar facilities.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"," <br />

X. Local Involvement<br /><br />
1. Selection of Study Areas<br /><br />
One of the early decisions made by the Mayor’s<br />
Advisory Committee on Small Business was to<br />
select three of the seventeen older shopping<br />
areas for study instead of singling out one or<br />
two. The rationale was twofold:<br /><br />
a. While none of the three areas could be said to<br />
be typical of all older retail centers, the<br />
combination of three diverse areas came as<br />
close as possible, thus fulfilling the<br />
Demonstration Grant requirement for national<br />
applicability.<br /><br />
b. The Light Street, Monument Street and<br />
Pennsylvania Avenue merchants’ associations<br />
were among the most active and most<br />
progressive in the city; hence, there was reason<br />
to expect a high degree of cooperation in the<br />
development and, hopefully, subsequent<br />
implementation of the plans.<br /><br />
Despite their dependence, to varying degrees,<br />
upon the pedestrian shopper, all three areas<br />
were in critical need of parking. Many shoppers<br />
will bypass closer centers to drive to a more<br />
distant center for a variety of reasons. Some<br />
may have moved from the neighborhood but<br />
continue the habit of shopping in familiar<br />
surroundings; some follow a family tradition of<br />
many years; some have built up a personal<br />
relationship with an owner, manager or sales<br />
person; and some are accepted as charge<br />
account customers by neighborhood stores and<br />
cannot or do not avail themselves of the same<br />
privilege in department stores. Each of the<br />
three areas contains a public market which has<br />
an attraction for many shoppers not within<br />
walking distance. And even those within<br />
walking distance often require a car to load<br />
bulky marketing.<br /><br />
During this Demonstration Project, a precedent<br />
was established with the opening of the City's<br />
first neighborhood off-street parking lot in the<br />
Monument Street business area. A lot for the<br />
Light Street area has been approved and should<br />
be operational in the near future. In each case,<br />
the merchants’ association leases the lot from<br />
the City, manages it and returns all revenue<br />
from its use to the City, with a minimum per<br />
dnnum guarantee. It was felt by the<br /><br />
Committee that the leverage provided by<br /><br />
these lots would be helpful in stimulating the<br />
INitiative for future economic development.<br /><br />
2. Light Street and Monument Street<br />
Although the individual characteristics of each<br />
of the subject areas has been discussed<br />
previously in this report, they share in common<br />
the fact that, except for Charles Street, one<br />
block to the west of Light Street, neither has<br />
yet deteriorated to the degree necessary for<br />
meeting urban renewal criteria. The problem<br />
here, as in so many other fairly healthy centers<br />
elsewhere, is that there are no provisions for<br />
dealing with moderate blight and no funds<br />
available for “‘preventive rehabilitation.”<br /><br />
In seeking an answer, the Small Business<br />
Committee met with representatives of the<br />
business areas and members of the city<br />
administration. Three possible courses of action<br />
were discussed:<br /><br />
~a. Spot clearance. While it would successfully<br /><br />
eliminate the blighted sections in or adjacent to<br />
the core, it was felt that the process would be<br />
too costly and too time-consuming in relation<br />
to the benefits gained.<br /><br />
b. Creation of a citywide Development<br />
Corporation. The Corporation would be a<br />
private one, albeit with quasi-governmental<br />
status, working closely with the appropriate<br />
city agencies, particularly Planning and Housing<br />
and Community Development. Its purpose<br />
would be to stimulate and coordinate all<br />
nonresidential economic development in the<br />
city, including industrial and commercial as<br />
well as retail.<br /><br />
Financing for the Development Corporation<br />
could come from the private sector and from<br />
the Small Business Administration’s 502<br />
Program. Small local development companies<br />
organized for specific and limited objectives<br />
could be formed in such areas as Light Street<br />
and Monument Street. The Development<br />
Corporation would provide professional,<br />
technical and, in some cases, financial<br />
assistance. Details of such a plan must be<br />
further refined and objections expressed to it<br />
must be dealt with.<br /><br />
c. Creation of a “’‘Business Improvement<br />
District.”” This appears to have the most<br />
promise of the three alternatives, and is<br />
essentially a ""'self-help’’ program. At the<br />
request of a given business area, the city’s<br />
Department of Planning would assign a district<br /><br />
37<br /><br />
planner to work with the merchants, propérty<br />
owners and, if appropriate, the residents. Any<br />
plan presented would require the approval of<br />
property owners who represent a substantial<br />
majority of the total assessed valuation of the<br />
proposed project district. The City would then<br />
be authorized to issue a bond to finance<br />
detailed planning and execution of an approved<br />
project. The City's investment would be<br />
recovered through an ad valorem assessment to<br />
be imposed upon the properties benefiting<br />
from the improvements, so that it would turn<br />
out to be a self-liquidating venture. The<br /><br />
Maryland General Assembly would have to pass<br /><br />
enabling legislation to give Baltimore this<br />
authority.<br /><br />
In order to more effectively implement such a<br />
project, it would be most helpful if present<br />
federal policy providing long-term low-interest<br />
loans for nonresidential rehabilitation in urban<br />
renewal areas were to be amended so as to offer<br />
the same benefits to a designated Business<br />
Improvement District. ‘<br /><br />
.3.. Pennsylvania Avenue<br /><br />
The Pennsylvania Avenue area offers both the<br />
greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity.<br />
During the term of this Demonstration Project,<br />
it was included as part of the Upton, Urban<br />
Renewal Project and was designated in total<br />
within the Model Cities boundaries.<br /><br />
a. Background<br /><br />
From its earliest days, Pennsylvania Avenue was<br />
a business street. |t was the first road linking<br />
this developing area with rural sections to the<br />
northwest and to the State of Pennsylvania,<br />
hence its name. In 1869, the City Council<br />
provided funds for the purchase of the present<br />
site of the Lafayette Market. One may visualize<br />
the scene in those days of nearby farmers<br />
pulling their wagons down Pennsylvania Road<br />
to sell meats and produce to the inhabitants of<br />
this growing residential area. However, as busy<br />
as it was during the latter part of the 19th and<br />
early part of the 20th centuries, it was not until<br />
after World War | that Pennsylvania Avenue<br />

X. Local Involvement<br />
<br />
1. Selection of Study Areas<br />
<br />
One of the early decisions made by the Mayor’s<br />
Advisory Committee on Small Business was to<br />
select three of the seventeen older shopping<br />
areas for study instead of singling out one or<br />
two. The rationale was twofold:<br />
<br />
a. While none of the three areas could be said to<br />
be typical of all older retail centers, the<br />
combination of three diverse areas came as<br />
close as possible, thus fulfilling the<br />
Demonstration Grant requirement for national<br />
applicability.<br />
<br />
b. The Light Street, Monument Street and<br />
Pennsylvania Avenue merchants’ associations<br />
were among the most active and most<br />
progressive in the city; hence, there was reason<br />
to expect a high degree of cooperation in the<br />
development and, hopefully, subsequent<br />
implementation of the plans.<br />
<br />
Despite their dependence, to varying degrees,<br />
upon the pedestrian shopper, all three areas<br />
were in critical need of parking. Many shoppers<br />
will bypass closer centers to drive to a more<br />
distant center for a variety of reasons. Some<br />
may have moved from the neighborhood but<br />
continue the habit of shopping in familiar<br />
surroundings; some follow a family tradition of<br />
many years; some have built up a personal<br />
relationship with an owner, manager or sales<br />
person; and some are accepted as charge<br />
account customers by neighborhood stores and<br />
cannot or do not avail themselves of the same<br />
privilege in department stores. Each of the<br />
three areas contains a public market which has<br />
an attraction for many shoppers not within<br />
walking distance. And even those within<br />
walking distance often require a car to load<br />
bulky marketing.<br />
<br />
During this Demonstration Project, a precedent<br />
was established with the opening of the City's<br />
first neighborhood off-street parking lot in the<br />
Monument Street business area. A lot for the<br />
Light Street area has been approved and should<br />
be operational in the near future. In each case,<br />
the merchants’ association leases the lot from<br />
the City, manages it and returns all revenue<br />
from its use to the City, with a minimum per<br />
dnnum guarantee. It was felt by the<br />
<br />
Committee that the leverage provided by<br />
<br />
these lots would be helpful in stimulating the<br />
INitiative for future economic development.<br />
<br />
2. Light Street and Monument Street<br />
Although the individual characteristics of each<br />
of the subject areas has been discussed<br />
previously in this report, they share in common<br />
the fact that, except for Charles Street, one<br />
block to the west of Light Street, neither has<br />
yet deteriorated to the degree necessary for<br />
meeting urban renewal criteria. The problem<br />
here, as in so many other fairly healthy centers<br />
elsewhere, is that there are no provisions for<br />
dealing with moderate blight and no funds<br />
available for “‘preventive rehabilitation.”<br />
<br />
In seeking an answer, the Small Business<br />
Committee met with representatives of the<br />
business areas and members of the city<br />
administration. Three possible courses of action<br />
were discussed:<br />
<br />
~a. Spot clearance. While it would successfully<br />
<br />
eliminate the blighted sections in or adjacent to<br />
the core, it was felt that the process would be<br />
too costly and too time-consuming in relation<br />
to the benefits gained.<br />
<br />
b. Creation of a citywide Development<br />
Corporation. The Corporation would be a<br />
private one, albeit with quasi-governmental<br />
status, working closely with the appropriate<br />
city agencies, particularly Planning and Housing<br />
and Community Development. Its purpose<br />
would be to stimulate and coordinate all<br />
nonresidential economic development in the<br />
city, including industrial and commercial as<br />
well as retail.<br />
<br />
Financing for the Development Corporation<br />
could come from the private sector and from<br />
the Small Business Administration’s 502<br />
Program. Small local development companies<br />
organized for specific and limited objectives<br />
could be formed in such areas as Light Street<br />
and Monument Street. The Development<br />
Corporation would provide professional,<br />
technical and, in some cases, financial<br />
assistance. Details of such a plan must be<br />
further refined and objections expressed to it<br />
must be dealt with.<br />
<br />
c. Creation of a “’‘Business Improvement<br />
District.”” This appears to have the most<br />
promise of the three alternatives, and is<br />
essentially a ""'self-help’’ program. At the<br />
request of a given business area, the city’s<br />
Department of Planning would assign a district<br />
<br />
37<br />
<br />
planner to work with the merchants, propérty<br />
owners and, if appropriate, the residents. Any<br />
plan presented would require the approval of<br />
property owners who represent a substantial<br />
majority of the total assessed valuation of the<br />
proposed project district. The City would then<br />
be authorized to issue a bond to finance<br />
detailed planning and execution of an approved<br />
project. The City's investment would be<br />
recovered through an ad valorem assessment to<br />
be imposed upon the properties benefiting<br />
from the improvements, so that it would turn<br />
out to be a self-liquidating venture. The<br />
<br />
Maryland General Assembly would have to pass<br />
<br />
enabling legislation to give Baltimore this<br />
authority.<br />
<br />
In order to more effectively implement such a<br />
project, it would be most helpful if present<br />
federal policy providing long-term low-interest<br />
loans for nonresidential rehabilitation in urban<br />
renewal areas were to be amended so as to offer<br />
the same benefits to a designated Business<br />
Improvement District. ‘<br />
<br />
.3.. Pennsylvania Avenue<br />
<br />
The Pennsylvania Avenue area offers both the<br />
greatest challenge and the greatest opportunity.<br />
During the term of this Demonstration Project,<br />
it was included as part of the Upton, Urban<br />
Renewal Project and was designated in total<br />
within the Model Cities boundaries.<br />
<br />
a. Background<br />
<br />
From its earliest days, Pennsylvania Avenue was<br />
a business street. |t was the first road linking<br />
this developing area with rural sections to the<br />
northwest and to the State of Pennsylvania,<br />
hence its name. In 1869, the City Council<br />
provided funds for the purchase of the present<br />
site of the Lafayette Market. One may visualize<br />
the scene in those days of nearby farmers<br />
pulling their wagons down Pennsylvania Road<br />
to sell meats and produce to the inhabitants of<br />
this growing residential area. However, as busy<br />
as it was during the latter part of the 19th and<br />
early part of the 20th centuries, it was not until<br />
after World War | that Pennsylvania Avenue<br />
developed a uniqueness of wider significance in<br />
Baltimore.<br />
<br />
Just shortly after the turn of the century, many<br />
Black families who previously occupied houses<br />
only on the small alley streets moved into<br />
residences on the main streets. The ‘Avenue’’<br />

in the life of the Black community. Theaters<br />
and other places of entertainment built in the<br />
1920’s heralded three decades of relative<br />
glamor and excitement for Pennsylvania<br />
Avenue. Life was dramatically expressed in<br />
music, song and dance from the stage, and<br />
many small “‘clubs’’ provided a setting for<br />
relaxation and laughter. Pennsylvania Avenue<br />
became not only the shopping street for the<br />
community, but its entertainment center as<br />

to strengthen the focus which the Avenue<br />
provided for the public life of the Black<br />
community. |f they were not served in other<br />
places, this was their street for shopping, for<br />
entertainment and for their parades. The<br />
Halloween and Easter Parades on the Avenue<br />
were gala events.<br /><br />

Ray Anthony, Woody Herman, the Ink Spots,<br />
Lena Horne, Pearl Bailey, '‘Baby’’ Lawrence,<br />
Charlie Barnet, and many others. Cab Calloway<br />
and ""‘Baby’’ Lawrence were raised in this area.<br />

along with the wider and stronger changes in<br />
Baltimore and the nation. Since the early<br />
1950’s, the vitality of the Avenue has declined.<br />

purchase services throughout the city. Shopping<br />
and entertainment patterns have changed. In<br />
1970, the Avenue’s needs are redevelopment<br />
and renewal.<br /><br />
b. Community Participation<br /><br />
Following the approval of its Demonstration<br />
Grant application, the Mayor’s Advisory<br />
Committee on Small Business held several<br />
meetings with representatives of the<br />
Pennsylvania Avenue-Lafayette Market<br />
Association (P.A.L.M.A.) and other<br />
non-member businessmen in the area. At that<br />
stage of the project, all efforts were visualized<br />
as being restricted to the business area only, so<br />

Black managers, there was only one Black<br />

Transcending all personal hang-ups, there<br />
emerged the intense desire of the residents for a<br />
better community for their children than the<br />
one in which they were raised. After two years<br />
of meetings, agreements and disagreements,<br />
frustrations and aggravation, pleasant<br />
<br />
discussions and harsh words, a final approval<br />
was given to the Upton Urban Renewal Plan<br />
and signed by the Mayor. It is significant that<br />
the final approved plan on which<br />
implementation will begin within the year bears<br />
a remarkable similarity to the concept<br />
developed earlier on the Demonstration Project<br />
as contained in this report. There were those<br />
who felt that the same results could have been<br />
achieved in less time and with far less effort,<br />
and while they may be right, it is equally true<br />
that the plan will be more meaningful to those<br />
affected by it because they had a voice in its<br />
preparation.<br />

Dear Citizen:<br /><br />
Baltimore’s Harbor offers a remarkable variety of<br />
opportunities to the thousands of citizens of this City<br />
and State and to an increasing number of visitors.<br />
While for many generations the port has been the<br />
center of commerce, industry and maritime trade,<br />
the harbor is entering a new era. We have<br />
rediscovered the waterfront as not only a place to<br />
earn a living, but a place to live, to eat, to boat, to<br />
relax and to celebrate. Baltimore’s Harbor is a<br />
unique resource. The thousands of jobs associated<br />
with shipping activities and industry now combined<br />
with the millions of visitors to the Inner Harbor,<br />
parks and historic sites makes the harbor one of the<br />
most important economic and social assets to this<br />
City, the State of Maryland, and to the nation. It is<br />
therefore critical that we make well informed<br />
decisions as to how the land, shoreline, and water<br />
are put to use.<br /><br />
This book was developed to provide you with the<br />
background information on how the harbor grew<br />
from its earliest days, issues which affect specific<br />
areas and communities, the complex operations of<br />
the Port and the variety of options which must be<br />
considered for future growth. Millions of public and<br />
private dollars are committed to projects to keep the<br /><br />
Port competitive and to enhance its stance in the<br />
international marketplace. There are also plans which<br />
call for rehabilitating commercial properties,<br />
converting vacant warehouses and building new<br />
housing, improving the water quality, and increasing<br />
the recreational use of the shoreline and water.<br /><br />
These are often complex projects requiring large<br />
sums of money for development and many years. |<br />
believe this book will help you better understand<br />
and appreciate the great variety of factors which<br />
must be carefully weighed to insure the balanced<br />
growth of maritime trade and the public use of this<br />
resource.<br /><br />
The challenge is great, but the return, the reward to<br />
the citizens of Baltimore, Maryland, and our many<br />
visitors makes the effort worthwhile.<br /><br />
Sincerely,<br /><br />

Baltimore is rediscovering its harbor. Each year<br />
thousands of people are drawn downtown to the<br />
Inner Harbor to festivals, entertainment, shops,<br />
restaurants, and visitor attractions. Once lined with<br />
rotting piers and derelict buildings, the Inner Harbor<br />
today sparkles with new development and bustles<br />
with activity.<br /><br />
Yet few people realize that the 1.5 mile-long<br />
shoreline of the Inner Harbor is but a very small<br />
segment of the Baltimore harbor: less than 4 percent<br />
of the total shoreline. Most of the remaining 40 miles<br />
of waterfront are devoted to the working port - to<br />
marine terminals, industry, and commerce. A much<br />
smaller portion, like the Inner Harbor, is used for<br />
public access and open space. /<br /><br />
This report is designed to clarify the complex<br />
nature of harbor activities and to help readers<br />
understand major issues and concerns related to the<br />
harbor so that they will be better prepared to<br />
evaluate proposals for the future development of this<br />
unique and valuable resource.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
The report is divided into four sections. The first<br />
provides an overview of the harbor as a whole - its<br />
past, present, and future. The second section consists<br />
of seven chapters, each of which takes a detailed<br />
look at a specific geographical area of the harbor.<br />
The third section outlines some of the major issues<br /><br />
related to the future of the harbor and presents<br /><br />
several policy recommendations for harbor<br />
development. The final section addresses harbor-<br />
wide programs now underway which will improve<br />
the quality of this resource for the public.<br /><br />

commissioners and their surveyor, Philip<br />
Jones, chose the head of the Northwest<br />

The growing ports of Baltimore and Fells Point, 1792<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
As always, transportation was the key<br />
factor. One important early artery was the<br />
Susquehanna River which tapped a great<br />
valley in eastern Pennsylvania and emptied<br />
into the Chesapeake Bay not far from Balti-<br />
more. Although its mouth was shallow and<br />
strewn with rocks, at times of high water<br />
barges loaded with grain and farm produce<br />
could be floated downriver and then sailed<br />
or towed to Baltimore’s port. Having sold<br />
their cargoes and barges as well, the barge-<br />
men would then walk or take coaches<br />
back home along the York Road.<br /><br />
By the time of the Revolution a net-<br />
work of roads was being constructed lead-<br />
ing out of Baltimore like spokes in a wheel.<br />
The names are familiar as city streets<br />
today: the road to Belair, to Harford<br />
County, to York, to Reisterstown, to Liberty<br />
Town, and to Frederick. Each was a com-<br />
mercial highway, thronged night and day<br />
with droves of cattle, stage coaches, horse-<br />
men, and with great Conestoga freight<br />
wagons drawn by six horses. The stage<br />
road from Philadelphia and points north<br />
passed through Baltimore on its way south,<br />
making it a crossroads of an interstate<br />
traffic.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
The first important industry in Balti-<br />
more was flour milling. There was a water-<br />
powered grist mill on the Jones Falls in<br />
1711, long before the town was laid out,<br />
and by 1810 this stream and the Gwynns<br />
Falls had a dozen or more in operation.<br /><br />
The plentiful forest and the demands of<br />
trade made shipbuilding and the maritime<br />
crafts the next most important businesses.<br />
Fells Point was the center for these crafts,<br />
and also the mariners’ home. To the east at<br />
Harris Creek the U.S. Frigate Constellation<br />
was launched in 1797, the first commis-<br />
sioned ship of the United States Navy, and<br />
many another ship, particularly the famous<br />
“Clippers” which served so well as priva-<br />
teers in the War of 1812. Ropemaking,<br />
cooperage, chandlery, and block making<br />
were among the trades in Fells Point,<br />
along with carpentry, caulking, and rigging.<br />
Baltimore Town, at the head of the old<br />
harbor, remained the commercial center<br />
with warehouses, docks, and the counting<br />
rooms of the merchants.<br /><br />
Although the potential was there, the<br />
real “take off”’ point for Baltimore’s economy<br />
came with the end of the Revolutionary<br />
War. Independence put an end to the British<br />

Maryland Port Administration<br /><br />
Vessels approach the Baltimore harbor<br />
either from the north via the Chesapeake<br />
and Delaware Canal or from the south via<br />
the Chesapeake Bay. The main channel<br />
into the harbor is nominally 42 feet deep<br />
and 800 feet wide. It is currently authorized<br />
to be deepened to 50 feet. However, due<br />
to the continuous process of silt settling<br />
into the channels the authorized depth is<br />
difficult to maintain. The harbor extends<br />
19.9 miles from Fort McHenry to the Bay<br />
Bridge in Annapolis. Three branch channels<br />
link the main channel to various port<br />
terminals.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Ships are loaded and unloaded at 11<br />
major general cargo marine terminals.<br />
These are both publicly and privately<br />
owned. The terminals vary in function and<br />
size, ranging from the 550-acre Dundalk<br />
Marine Terminal to the 5-acre Rukert<br />
Terminal. Most terminals contain storage<br />
space, rail yards, transit or storage sheds,<br />
docking facilities, and berthing space.<br />

Break-bulk cargo<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
There are four types of cargo handled<br />
by the port. The first two described below<br />
- containerized freight and breakbulk<br />
cargo - are termed general cargo.<br /><br />
Containerized Freight - Baltimore<br />
ranks second among East Coast and Gulf<br />
Coast ports in moving containers, the 20 to<br />
40 foot, van-like boxes that can be lifted<br />
off a ship and placed directly on a truck<br />
chassis. Shipping cargo in containers<br />
reduces handling time and damage. Balti-<br />
more was a pioneer in container handling,<br />
receiving its first container cargo in 1963<br />
when other ports were skeptically waiting<br />
to see if the new cargo-handling technol-<br />
ogy had any future. Baltimore’s early lead<br />
has paid off. Between 1970 and 1976 the<br />
volume of containerized cargo shipped<br />
through the harbor tripled. By January 1977<br />
the Port of Baltimore had moved its first<br />
million containers and by April 1981 it had<br />
handled-its second million.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Breakbulk Cargo - With approximately<br />
88 berths, six-million square feet of<br />
enclosed storage, and five-million cubic<br />
feet of cold storage, the port is capable of<br />
handling large quantities of mixed cargo,<br />
known as breakbulk, which requires<br />
individualized loading and unloading.<br />
Breakbulk cargo is typified by smaller<br />
articles bound for several locations and<br />
specialized items like yachts, air condition-<br />
ing equipment, and farm machinery. In<br />
recent yedrs the port has also become a<br />
leading depot for “project cargo,” in which<br />
all the components for a single project<br />
(for example, a factory or even an entire<br />
village) are marshalled together from many<br />
suppliers, packed, loaded, and ultimately<br />
shipped to their destination. The port has<br />
been able to capture a large share of the<br />
project cargo bound for the Mideast and<br />
Southeast Asia because of its proximity to<br />
many Midwest and East Coast firms special-<br />
izing in multiphased projects, its expansive<br />
rail and highway access network, its exten-<br />
sive storage facilities, and the variety and<br />
flexibility of its cargo handling equipment.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Bulk Cargo - The major portion of the<br />
port’s tonnage each year is in the form of<br />
bulk cargo. This type of cargo is moved in<br />
large quantities usually in ships which only<br />
carry that one product. These ships take<br />
advantage of the cost savings derived from<br />
handling large quantities of a single cargo<br />
and are often the largest vessels in the port,<br />
requiring deep channels like the 50-foot<br />
channel proposed for the Port of<br />
Baltimore.<br /><br />
There are two categories of bulk cargo,<br />
dry and liquid. Coal, grain, sugar, and ore<br />
are examples of dry bulk cargo. Petroleum<br />
products, molasses, latex and specialized<br />
food and soap bases are all liquid bulk<br />
cargo. In recent years the port has set<br />
records in moving dry bulk carga, particu-<br />
larly coal and grain. The port has 24 bulk<br />
cargo berths. Modern equipment at these<br />
berths makes it possible to unload 6,000<br />
tons of ore an hour and load 11,000 tons of<br />
coal and 270,000 bushels of grain every<br />
hour. Most bulk goods require large<br />
amounts of land for storage while awaiting<br />
export or local distribution after import.-<br />
This can be seen in Canton where there<br />
are many acres devoted to storing petro-<br />
leum and fertilizers, and in Fairfield which<br />
has over 300 acres occupied by petroleum<br />
tank farms and rail yards used to store coal<br />
in cars.<br /><br /><br /><br />

P<br /><br />
Maryland Port Administration<br /><br />
Transportation System:<br /><br />
Serving the port is an elaborate net-<br />
work of railroads and highways which are<br />
essential to the flow of trade. Two trunk-<br />
line railways operate in the harbor area:<br />
the CSX Railroad and Conrail. Together<br />
these two lines have over 1,100 miles of<br />
track in Maryland and 30,000 miles<br />
nationwide.<br /><br />
In November 1980 the Chessie System<br />
and Seaboard Coastland Railroad merged<br />
to form the CSX Railroad. The new rail<br />
system serves the mid-Atlantic states as<br />
far south as Florida and the entire Mid-<br />
west industrial heartland as far west as St.<br />
Louis. CSX operations in Baltimore are on<br />
the Chessie System’s B&amp; O and Western<br />
Maryland Railway tracks.<br /><br />
The Chessie System’s total volume<br />
of freight traffic in Baltimore in 1977 was<br />
almost 25 million tons. Ten million tons of<br />
this traffic was coal. Mixed freight, grain,<br />
and ore were the other major goods<br />
moved through Baltimore. The Chessie<br />
System serves the industries of Canton<br />
and Sparrows Point on the east side and of<br />
Curtis Bay, Locust Point and Hawkins Point<br />
on the west side.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Conrail traffic bound for Baltimore<br />
generally comes through northeastern<br />
Maryland. In 1977 Conrail hauled 20.3<br />
million tons of freight through Baltimore.<br />
Over a third of this total or approximately 7<br />
million tons was unloaded in Baltimore.<br />
The major commodities brought into Balti-<br />
more by Conrail were ore and trailer-on-<br />
flat-car containers. Conrail also provided<br />
service in the Canton area to a large grain<br />
operation, its own coal pier, and several<br />
industries. o<br /><br />
Besides the two major trunk lines,<br />
there is the Canton Railroad, recently<br />
purchased by a venture capital firm. This<br />
small rail line switches cars between the<br />
CSX and Conrail tracks and moves them to<br />
industries in the Canton area. It currently<br />
operates over 32 miles of track in east Balti-<br />
more. The railroad’s primary cargo in<br />
previous years has been iron ore, chrome,<br />
and manganese. However, most ore is now<br />
brought to Baltimore either by barge or by<br />
truck.<br /><br />
In addition to the railroads, a complete<br />
network of interstate highways, regional<br />
roads, and local streets provides access to<br />
the harbor. The interstate expressways (1-70,<br />
1-83, and 1-95) link Baltimore to neighbor-<br />
Ing states.<br /><br /><br /><br />

production process - are usually designated<br />
water-dependent. These industries actually<br />
use their waterfront locations to ship and<br />
receive goods essential to their operations.<br />
While the number varies from year to year,<br />
it is estimated that between 40,000 and<br />
60,000 people are employed in activities<br />
directly related to the Port of Baltimore.<br /><br />
Other firms are located on or near the<br />
harbor because they benefit from the avail-<br />
ability of water transportation although<br />
they are not dependent on shipping or<br />
receiving goods by water from their own<br />
sites. Such industries are designated<br />
“water-related” and include Procter and<br />
Gamble, E. Renneberg Machinery Co., and<br />
Baltimore Copper Paint Co.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Carr-Lowery - glass container manufacture and B.G.&amp;E.s<br />
Westport Generating Station - non-water dependent industry<br /><br /><br /><br />
Finally, there are industries which are<br />
neither water-dependent nor water-related<br />
but which are nevertheless located on or<br />
near the harbor. They neither directly use<br />
the water for transportation purposes them-<br />
selves nor do they significantly benefit from<br />
the availability of water transportation.<br />
Their location on the harbor may have<br />
historical roots. At one time they may have<br />
relied on the port for their operation, but<br />
economic or technological changes may<br />
have altered their dependency. Their loca-<br />
tion near the water may have been<br />
determined by factors completely unrelated<br />
to the port, for instance low land costs.<br />
Examples of non-port-related industries<br />
around the Baltimore harbor are Locke<br />
Insulators, General Motors, and Lever<br />
Brothers. It is estimated that over 20,000<br />
people are employed by firms not directly<br />
tied to the port’s operations.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

. waterfront in Fells Point - waterfront commercial activities for over 200 years<br /><br />
Commercial Activity:<br /><br />
While a smattering of restaurants and<br />
ships can be found in most of the areas<br />
around the harbor, the only areas of con-<br />
centrated commercial activity now are the<br />
Inner Harbor and Fells Point.<br /><br />
The Inner Harbor and Fells Point are<br />
experiencing a rebirth of commercial<br />
activity largely as a result of City-sponsored<br />
urban renewal projects which have made<br />
these areas attractive for private develop-<br />
ment. By capitalizing on its dramatic water-<br />
front location, City urban renewal<br />
programs have transformed the Inner<br />
Harbor into the region’s most desirable<br />
location for offices and shops as well as for<br />
tourist trade. With seven new major office<br />
buildings and several hundred thousand<br />
square feet of new retail space the Inner<br />
Harbor provides thousands of jobs and<br />
attracts shoppers from the entire region<br />
and tourists from across the country. In<br />
the past ten years more than $500 million<br />
have been invested in private commercial<br />
ventures like Harborplace, the Hyatt Hotel,<br />
and office buildings.<br /><br /><br /><br />
In contrast to the Inner Harbor, Fells<br />
Point’'s commercial activity largely serves a<br />
local clientele, although the area’s popular<br />
taverns and antique shops attract customers<br />
from the entire region. New-found interest<br />
in downtown living, spurred by the popu-<br />
larity of the Inner Harbor, has created a<br />
market for housing in Fells Point, particu-<br />
larly along the waterfront. This demand is<br />
reflected in proposals for converting the<br />
area’s vacant warehouses into condomini-<br />
ums and for building new shoreline town-<br />
houses, some of which are now completed.<br /><br />
Recreation and Open Space:<br /><br />
Recreational facilities were an early<br />
commerical enterprise in Baltimore’s<br />
harbor. As early as 1807 a private beer<br />
garden at Spring Garden on the Middle<br />
Branch was a popular place for a day’s out-<br />
ing. Fish houses, beer gardens, race tracks,<br />
and camp sites were located throughout<br />
the Middle Branch, Cherry Hill, Brooklyn,<br />
and Canton. The most famous, Riverview<br />
Park, started in 1868 along Canton’s south-<br />
ern shoreline at the site of today’s Western<br />
Electric plant. By the early 1900s the park<br />
had attained the reputation as “The Coney<br />
Island of the South” and boasted dance<br />
halls, a long boating pier, beaches, two<br /><br /><br /><br />

The Future of the Harbor<br /><br />
The following activities will figure<br />
prominently in the future of Baltimore’s<br />
Harbor.<br /><br />
Marine Terminals:<br /><br />
Most of the port’s existing marine<br />
terminals are operating at capacity. If<br />
the port is to remain competitive and<br />
capture expanding trade opportunities,<br />
additional terminal capacity must be<br />
provided. To meet projected future<br />
demand, the Maryland Port Administration<br />
plans major investments<br /><br />
Canton Seagirt Marine Terminal -<br />
Using dredge spoil removed for the con-<br />
struction of the Interstate 95 Fort McHenry<br />
Tunnel, the City has filled in the Canton<br />
shoreline to create a new 140-acre site for a<br />
- container terminal. When completed by<br />
the Maryland Port Administration in the<br />
1990s, this new facility will be capable of<br />
handling an estimated 2,250,000 tons of<br />
container cargo annually.<br /><br />
Masonville Marine Terminal - This new<br />
350-acre facility is to be built on filled land<br />
in the Fairfield area. Costing an estimated<br />
$200 million to develop, the Masonville<br />
Terminal will include four berths - two<br /><br />
Canton Seagirt Marine Terminal<br /><br />
opening in the mid-1990s and another two<br />
by the year 2000. Once completed the<br />
terminal will be able to handle more than<br />
three million tons of container cargo a<br />
year.<br /><br />
Channel Dredging:<br /><br />
In conjunction with these investments<br />
in marine terminals, several other related<br />
projects are necessary to the future growth<br />
of the poft. The most important is the<br />
dredging of the main harbor channel from<br />
its current depth of 42 feet to a new depth<br />
of 50 feet. This project will allow the port<br />
to remain competitive and expand its<br />
import and export of bulk products by<br />
accommodating today’s larger, deep-draft<br />
cargo ships.<br /><br />
To economize on shipping costs, com-<br />
panies use large ships of over 100,000 dead<br />
weight tons to transport bulk goods like<br />
ore, coal,.grain, sugar, and petroleum pro-<br />
ducts. When full, these ships ride very low<br />
in the water. Baltimore’s existing 42-foot<br />
channel can accommodate full ships no<br />
larger than 60,000 dead weight tons. As a<br />
result many of the larger coal carrying ships<br />
only partially load in Baltimore, stopping at<br />
another port where the channel depth is<br />
greater to fill to capacity. Dredging the<br />
main channel to 50 feet will dramatically<br />
increase the efficiency of operations of<br />
many of these ships and will allow the port<br />
to move quantities of bulk at lower costs.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Hart/Miller Islands<br /><br /><br /><br />
To meet the need for disposal of the<br />
material from the 50-foot channel deepen-<br />
ing project the state has built a contain-<br />
ment site for over 50 million cubic yards of<br />
fill at Hart and Miller Islands just east of the<br />
Back River in Baltimoré County. The main<br />
channel dredging, a federal project, and<br />
the construction and operation of the<br />
containment site, a state project, are<br />
complex and costly and will require a<br />
concentrated effort over the next five to<br />
eight years.<br /><br />
The state, working with federal agen-<br />
cies and local jurisdictions, is also studying<br />
various alternatives for handling spoil from<br />
future dredging projects. Even with the<br />
Hart and Miller Islands disposal capacity of<br />
over 50 million cubic yards, methods for<br />
handling the remaining 80 million cubic<br />
yards expected from Maryland projects<br />
over the next 20 years, will have to be<br />
identified. Possibilities include overboard<br />
disposal of clean material, wetlands crea-<br />
tion, containment, recycling, hauling spoil<br />
inland, and burial in a deep trench of the<br />
Chesapeake Bay.<br /><br />
Highways:<br /><br />
A number of transportation improve-<br /><br />
ments are planned to accommodate the<br />
increased cargo trade that will be moving<br />
through the port. The most important<br />
highway project is the Fort McHenry<br />
Tunnel, which is scheduled to be<br />
completed by 1985. As the final link of<br />
Interstate 95 to be built in the City, the<br />
tunnel will cross the Patapsco River<br />
between Locust Point and Canton provid-<br />
ing expressway access between the port<br />
and East Coast cities. The planned recon-<br />
struction of local streets will also play an<br />
important role in reducing traffic conges-<br />
tion in several areas, thereby improving<br />
access between regional highways and the<br />
port.<br /><br />
Coal Export Terminals:<br /><br />
Spurred by the high cost of oil and the<br />
consequent search by countries for<br />
cheaper alternative fuels, the United States<br />
is experiencing considerable worldwide<br />
demand on its vgst coal reserves especially<br />
for generation of electricity in Europe. It<br />
has been estimated that between 1980 and<br />
the year 2000 U.S. coal exports will increase<br />
by 100 to 200 percent. Due to its proximity<br />

Maryland Port Administration<br /><br />
Consolidation Coal Company’s giant coal loading equipment, Canton<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
shipment point for outbound coal.<br /><br />
Two new major coal terminals have<br />
been developed on the harbor in Baltimore<br />
City:<br /><br />
Island Creek Coal Company currently<br />
the largest single exporter of coal in Balti-<br />
more, has spent $100 million to expand and<br />
upgrade its existing coal terminal in Curtis<br />
Bay and to construct a new pier. The facil-<br />
ity is expected to export 10 to 12 million<br />
tons of coal per year by the late 1980’s.<br /><br />
Consolidation Coal Co., which pur-<br />
chased all the property owned by the<br />
Canton Co., has invested $110 million to<br />
renovate a ore pier and storage and han-<br />
dling facility at the former Canton Marine<br />
Terminal. As a result of this project, annual<br />
coal export capacity through Baltimore is<br />
expected to increase significantly.<br /><br />
The port’s coal terminals, supported by<br />
an improved transportation system, could<br />
enable the port to move 30 to 40 million<br />
tons of coal per year by 1985, tripling the<br />
12.7 million tons exported in 1980. Clearly,<br />
the increase in coal export will have a*<br />
significant impact on the port and the<br />
entire state.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Industrial Development:<br /><br />
Several private industrial development<br />
projects have been announced:<br /><br />
General Motors has renovated its<br />
Broening Highway plant.<br /><br />
W. R. Grace Co. has purchased an 18-<br />
acre site in Fairfield to develop a liquid<br />
bulk storage and handling facility. In con-<br />
junction, with this project, an existing pier<br />
will be extended 860 feet and rail service to<br />
the property will be expanded and<br />
improved.<br /><br />
Colonial Pipeline Corp., which oper-<br />
ates the Texas-to New Jersey oil pipeline<br />
serving the entire East Coast, plans to<br />
double the capacity of its pipeline, which<br />
serves petroleum storage and distribution<br />
operators in Fairfield.<br /><br />
American Seamless located in Curtis<br />
Bay anticipates expanding its operation and<br />
increasing employment from 60 to 150 to<br />

Holabird Industrial Park, a newly devel-<br />

Baltimore, has already attracted several<br />
firms. A 22-acre Foreign Trade Zone has<br />
been created and is to be developed and<br />
managed by McCormick Properties.<br />
Employment at the completed industrial<br />

Two new major coal terminals have<br />

<br />
Island Creek Coal Company currently<br />
the largest single exporter of coal in Balti-<br />
more, has spent $100 million to expand and<br />
upgrade its existing coal terminal in Curtis<br />
Bay and to construct a new pier. The facil-<br />
ity is expected to export 10 to 12 million<br />
tons of coal per year by the late 1980’s.<br />
<br />
Consolidation Coal Co., which pur-<br />
chased all the property owned by the<br />
Canton Co., has invested $110 million to<br />
renovate a ore pier and storage and han-<br />
dling facility at the former Canton Marine<br />
Terminal. As a result of this project, annual<br />
coal export capacity through Baltimore is<br />
expected to increase significantly.<br />
<br />
The port’s coal terminals, supported by<br />
an improved transportation system, could<br />
enable the port to move 30 to 40 million<br />
tons of coal per year by 1985, tripling the<br />
12.7 million tons exported in 1980. Clearly,<br />
the increase in coal export will have a*<br />
significant impact on the port and the<br />
entire state.<br />

<br />
Industrial Development:<br />
<br />
Several private industrial development<br />
projects have been announced:<br />
<br />
General Motors has renovated its<br />
Broening Highway plant.<br />
<br />
W. R. Grace Co. has purchased an 18-<br />
acre site in Fairfield to develop a liquid<br />
bulk storage and handling facility. In con-<br />
junction, with this project, an existing pier<br />
will be extended 860 feet and rail service to<br />
the property will be expanded and<br />
improved.<br />
<br />
Colonial Pipeline Corp., which oper-<br />
ates the Texas-to New Jersey oil pipeline<br />
serving the entire East Coast, plans to<br />
double the capacity of its pipeline, which<br />
serves petroleum storage and distribution<br />
operators in Fairfield.<br />

American Seamless located in Curtis<br />
Bay anticipates expanding its operation and<br />
increasing employment from 60 to 150 to<br />

Pier 4 Power Plant - Renovated as a family entertainment center by Six Flags Corp.<br /><br />
In addition to these projects that have<br />
been announced, there are additional oppor-<br />
tunities for industrial development around<br />
the port. Canton, Locust Point, and Fairfield<br />
contain a limited number of available sites,<br />
usually under 30 acres. Hawkins Point, with<br />
over 400 acres of undeveloped land, offers a<br />
substantial opportunity for new industrial<br />
and/or maritime related development. If all<br />
400 acres were developed at an average of<br />
12 employees per acre, almost 5,000 new<br />
jobs would result. This opportunity, coupled<br />
with the development of other smaller par-<br />
cels around the harbor and the announced<br />
projects, presents the potential of produc-<br />
ing over 10,000 new industrial and maritime<br />
jobs around the port by the year 2000. This<br />
would constitute a significant contribution<br />
to the City’s employment base.<br /><br />
Residential and Commercial Development:<br /><br />
The redevelopment of the Inner<br />
Harbor has rekindled the public’s interest<br />
in the waterfront as a place to spend time,<br />
shop, and live. While not nearly as exten-<br />
sive as the other types of economic activity<br />
around the harbor, the residential and<br />
commercial development occurring and<br />
expected in the the Inner Harbor, Fells<br />
Point, and Falls Harbor areas is important in<br /><br /><br /><br />
that it represents significant additional<br />
private investment in the rehabilitation of<br />
the City. The activity has generated a new<br />
national, and local, interest in Baltimore as<br />
a place to visit and live.<br /><br />
Several waterfront redevelopment projects<br />
are likely in the future:<br /><br />
Pier 4 Power Plant - In late December,<br />
1982, the City announced that it had<br />
selected the Six Flags Corp. as developers<br />
of the Pier 4 Power Plant. The Power Plant<br />
will be an amusement center including<br />
rides, attractions, a museum, theaters,<br />
shops, and restaurants drawing on the turn-<br />
of-the century as its main theme to open in<br />
1985.<br /><br />
Inner Harbor East - Piers 5 and 6 and<br />
the area east of the Jones Falls, known as<br />
Falls Harbor, has tremendous potential for<br />
future development to attract visitors. With<br />
Little Italy immediately adjacent to the area,<br />
develoﬁ{\ent could build on international<br />
attractions and include a public waterfront<br />
promenade, marina, plaza, and specialized<br />

Public Access in Private Projects -<br />
Working with private developers, the City<br />
has been able to secure public access to<br />
the shoreline in a number of projects.<br />
These include public shoreline promenades<br />
at Thames Point and the Anchorage pro-<br />
jects in Fells Point, a public observation<br />
tower at the proposed Masonville Marine<br />
Terminal, and wetland interpretation areas<br />
provided by Locke Insulators in Reedbird<br />

Street-End Parks - Public access does<br />
not always have to be on a large scale. The<br />
City has identified several points where<br />
streets end at the shoreline. These hold the<br />
potential for street-end parks. Hull Street<br />
on Locust Point and the shoreline at Boston<br />
and O’Donnell Streets have been devel-<br />
oped as small, public parks and include<br />
landscaping and a short pier for temporary<br />
boat mooring.<br /><br />
Fort Armistead Park - Originally con-<br />
structed in 1898 as one of five forts to<br />
guard the harbor, Fort Armistead has been<br />
unused since the late 1920s. While the 38-<br />
acre park offers a unique view of ships<br />
passing under the Francis Scott Key Bridge<br />
and of the operations of Bethlehem Steel’s<br />
Sparrows Point Plant across the water, the<br />
park was badly deteriorated. Construction<br />
has now been completed which improves<br />
the shoreline, provides boat launches, and<br /><br />
takes advantage of the view afforded by<br />
the park’s bluffs.<br /><br />
Fort Smallwood Park - Another of the<br />
five forts, Fort Smallwood is located in Anne<br />
Arundel County but owned and maintained<br /><br />
Public promenade, Anchorage townhouses on the Canton waterfront<br /><br /><br /><br />
1<br /><br />
by the City. Plans have been prepared call-<br />
ing for the renovation of existing park facil-<br />
ities and the improvement of the shoreline.<br />
These include improvements to bathing<br />
beaches, boating facilities, and recreation<br />
areas.<br /><br />
In addition to these specific recreation<br />
projects, the future may also see the crea-<br />
tion of a new visitor attraction - the Five<br />
Forts of Baltimore. Fort McHenry, Fort<br />
Armistead, Fort:Smallwood, Fort Carroll, and<br />
Fort Howard possess rich histories. Except<br />
for Fort McHenry’s role in the War of 1812,<br />
the history of these forts has long been<br />
ignored. Establishing the Five Forts visitor<br />
attraction would uncover this history. Such a<br />
venture would require finding a public or<br />
private sponsor to rehabilitate three of the<br />
forts (Smallwood, Armistead, and Carroll)<br />
and to establish a tour program. While now<br />
no more than a proposal, the Five Forts<br />
concept holds the potential of contributing<br />
to the City’s angl. the region’s effort to<br />

Located on the Northwest Branch of<br />

velopment History<br /><br />
The area derives its name from the<br />
Chinese province of Canton which was the<br />
primary trading partner of Captain John<br />
O’Donnell, the 18th century trader whose<br />
estate developed into the present-day<br />
Canton. The first major industry in Canton<br />
was Stodder’s Shipyard from which the<br />
famous U.S. Frigate Constellation was .<br />
launched in 1797. A portion of Canton was<br /><br />
annexed to the City of Baltimore as early as<br /><br />
1816, and in 1918 the area’s current boun-<br />
daries were established.<br /><br />
Throughout the 19th century Canton’s<br />
shipyards, terminals and industry supplied<br />
much of the materials that fed the city’s<br />
and nation’s growth. During World War |,<br />
Canton’s industries made a significant con-<br /><br />
tribution to the United States armed forces:<br /><br />
the American Smelting and Refining Co.<br /><br />
¥<br /><br />
supplied cartridge casting, the canneries<br />
helped to meet the food demand, and the<br />
terminals located along the waterfront were<br />
major supply bases to the U.S. army in<br />
France. Postwar development saw the con-<br />
struction of Pennsylvania Railroad’s $6<br />
million pier and grain elevator on Newkirk<br />
Street. Other national industries such as the<br />
American Radiator and Standard Corp.,<br />
Lever Brothers, General Motors, and West-<br />
ern Electric constructed major manufactur-<br />
ing plants in the first half of the 20th<br />
century.<br /><br />
During World War Il Canton’s water-<br />
front terminals resumed their earlier role as<br />
a major supply base to America’s armed<br />
forces. After the war private businesses<br />
shared in the general economic boom,<br />
investing heavily in warehouses, piers, and<br />

Industrial Activity: Approximately<br />
15,000 employees work in Canton’s more<br />
than 20 manufacturing establishments. Most<br />
of these businesses are concentrated in<br />
four clusters. Bulk material producers, such<br />
as Lebanon Chemical, and Lehigh Portland<br />
Cement, are located on the harbor along<br />
Clinton Street in west Canton. Although<br />
located directly on the harbor, neither<br />
Agrico nor Lehigh Portland make use of<br />
their deepwater access for shipments. A<br />
diverse group of medium and large manu-<br />
facturers can be found along Boston Street<br />
in north Canton. These include GAF Corp.,<br />
Crown Cork and Seal, S. Schapiro and<br />
Sons, and Quality Chemicals. East of New-<br />
kirk Street are Canton’s major employers,<br />
Lever Brothers and General Motors. These<br />
companies employ over 5,000 persons on<br />
approximately 150 acres of land in the<br />
heart of Canton. Apart from other heavy<br />
manufacturing activities, National Gypsum<br />
maintains a facility at Newkirk and Newgate<br />
Streets. Further east, along Colgate Creek,<br />
is another cluster of manufacturers which<br />
includes Universal Foods and SCM Glidden<br />

The area’s largest employers have been<br />
in Canton since the 1930s. The General<br />
Motors car and truck assembly plant began<br />
operations in 1935, increasing in size from<br />
46 to 167 acres since that time. Employment<br />
at GM peaked at 6,991 in 1978 and has<br />
since declined to 3,500. In 1981 the Balti-<br />
more plant stopped making trucks and<br />
began a major modernization of both plant<br />
and equipment in preparation for produc-<br />
ing the company’s new J-car. However,<br />
decreasing auto sales caused a halt in the<br />
modernization project until late 1982. At<br />
that time a scaled back upgrading program<br />
resumed. It is now anticipated that produc-<br />
tion will center around small vans.<br /><br />
Western Electric Corporation began<br />
operations here in 1929. The plant, which<br />
at one time employed approximately 5,000<br />
persons at its 169 acre Point Breeze site,<br />
announced that it would phase-out its<br />
Baltimore plant.<br /><br />
Lever Brothers has been in Canton<br />
since 1939. The plant manufactures All and<br />
Wisk detergent, Aim and Close-up tooth-<br />
paste, and Dove soap; it employs 1,047<br />
persons. Over the years the company has<br />
made substantial investments in plant<br />
modernization and pollution abatement<br />
equipment. In 1982 the company began<br />
construction of a $10 million sulphanami-<br />
lide facility.<br /><br />

approximately 150 acres of land in the<br />
heart of Canton. Apart from other heavy<br />
manufacturing activities, National Gypsum<br />
maintains a facility at Newkirk and Newgate<br />
Streets. Further east, along Colgate Creek,<br />
is another cluster of manufacturers which<br />
includes Universal Foods and SCM Glidden<br />

The area’s largest employers have been<br />
in Canton since the 1930s. The General<br />
Motors car and truck assembly plant began<br />
operations in 1935, increasing in size from<br />
46 to 167 acres since that time. Employment<br />
at GM peaked at 6,991 in 1978 and has<br />
since declined to 3,500. In 1981 the Balti-<br />
more plant stopped making trucks and<br />
began a major modernization of both plant<br />
and equipment in preparation for produc-<br />
ing the company’s new J-car. However,<br />
decreasing auto sales caused a halt in the<br />
modernization project until late 1982. At<br />
that time a scaled back upgrading program<br />
resumed. It is now anticipated that produc-<br />
tion will center around small vans.<br />
<br />
Western Electric Corporation began<br />
operations here in 1929. The plant, which<br />
at one time employed approximately 5,000<br />
persons at its 169 acre Point Breeze site,<br />
announced that it would phase-out its<br />
Baltimore plant.<br />
<br />
Lever Brothers has been in Canton<br />
since 1939. The plant manufactures All and<br />
Wisk detergent, Aim and Close-up tooth-<br />
paste, and Dove soap; it employs 1,047<br />
persons. Over the years the company has<br />
made substantial investments in plant<br />
modernization and pollution abatement<br />
equipment. In 1982 the company began<br />
construction of a $10 million sulphanami-<br />
lide facility.<br />

Private: A significant amount of private<br />
investment has been committed to Canton.<br />
This includes:<br /><br />
*General Motors - In 1981 General<br />
Motors Corp. announced plans for a<br />
major modernization and a 433,000-<br />
square-foot expansion of its Broening<br />
Highway Plant. Total investment in the<br />
project was projected to exceed $500<br />
million. This project was suspended for<br /><br />
-about a year, due to reduced auto<br /><br />
,sales. In September of 1982, GM<br />
announced the modernization would<br />
resume although at a reduced level of<br />
$270 million. As part of this program,<br />
GM has aquired 26 acres in the Hola-<br />
bird Industrial Park from the City with<br />
an option on an additional 24 acres.<br />
The Holabird acreage has been used to<br />
replace a parking lot displaced by the<br />
plant’s expansion on its current site.<br /><br />
*Consolidation Coal Co. - This sub-<br />
sidiary of Conoco Oil Co. acquired the<br />
Canton Railroad, Cottman Ore Pier,<br />
and 110 acres of associated land which<br />
it has developed as a major coal export<br />
facility with an initial capacity of 10<br />
million tons per year. More than $100<br />
million in improvements has included<br /><br /><br /><br />
to Baltimore by unit train, a system in<br />
which an entire train is used to trans-<br />
port a single product to one final<br />
destination. Consolidation Coal Co.<br />
opened the facility in October, 1983.<br /><br />
*Canton Railroad - Canton Develop-<br /><br />
ment Co., a venture capital firm based<br />
in Florida, purchased the Canton Rail-<br />
road from a subsidiary of Consolida-<br />
tion Coal Co. in October of 1982. The<br />
company plans to expand the railroad’s<br />
rolling stock and is considering con-<br />
struction of a new office building.<br /><br />
*Rukert Terminals, Inc. - This Baltimore-<br /><br />
based company is currently improving<br />
its bulk terminal facilities on Pier 5<br />
along Clinton street at a total cost of $7<br />
million, including $1 million in Indus-<br />
trial Development Revenue Bonds. The<br />
improvements include construction of<br />
several new buildings for bulk cargo<br /><br />
storage and reconstruction of a pier<br /><br />
after the completion of the 1-95, Fort<br />
McHenry Tunnel in Canton.<br /><br />
*Apex Qil Co. - Through the acquisition<br /><br />
of the long vacant ASARCO copper<br />
smelting plant on Eastbourne Avenue,<br />
the Apex Qil Co. has increased its<br />
acreage fivefold to over 50 acres.<br /><br />
Public: To support the considerable<br /><br /><br /><br />
1<br /><br />
tion in the Canton area. The express-<br />
way will link the Canton and Locust<br />
Point industrial areas, provide direct<br />
access southwest to the Baltimore-<br />
Washington corridor and northeast to<br />
New York, and relieve truck traffic on<br />
local residential streets north and west<br />
of the Canton industrial area. The<br />
expressway is currently completed to<br />
Keith Avenue. Work on the final phase<br />
of 1-95 in Canton, the Fort McHenry<br /><br />
Tunnel, expressway approaches, and a<br /><br />
toll facility is scheduled for completion<br />
in 1985. In conjunction with work on<br />
the expressway, several new access<br />
routes are being built.<br /><br />
In addition, various local street<br />
improvements are programmed in<br />
Canton; the widening of Ponca Street,<br />
reconstruction of Poncabird Pass and<br />
Haven Street and the reconstruction<br />
and widening of Clinton Street from<br />
Boston Street to Leland Avenue.<br /><br />
*Holabird Industrial Park - On surplus<br /><br />
Army land the city is developing a 170-<br />
acre industrial park. Streets and utilities<br />
are being installed and sites are being<br />
marketed for general purpose indus-<br />
trial uses. When completed Holabird is<br />
expected to provide 2,500-to-3,000<br />
jobs. In 1982 the federal government<br />
approved the City’s application for a<br />
20-acre Foreign Trade Zone.<br />
McCormick Properties was selected by<br />
the City to develop and operate a 20-<br />
acre Foreign Trade Zone located in the<br />
northwest corner of the industrial park.<br /><br />
Among other benefits a Foreign Trade<br />
Zone allows components from over-<br />
seas to be assembled in this country at<br />
a reduced import duty. This encour-<br />
ages new industries to establish assem-<br />
bly plants in the zone and provide new<br />
jobs and property taxes in Baltimore.<br /><br />
*Canton Seagirt Marine Terminal -<br /><br />
Dredge spoil from the excavation for<br />
the 1-95 Fort McHenry Tunnel has<br />
been used to create 147 acres of new<br />
waterfront land between the Sea Land<br />
Service container terminal and the<br />
Western Electric Co. The Maryland<br />
Port Administration will develop the<br />
site into the Port’s second largest con-<br />
tainer terminal. It will include three<br />
new 1,000 foot long berths and an<br />
extension of the existing Sea Land<br />
service berth. The MPA has estimated<br />
in 1982 that it will cost $123 million to<br />
develop the new terminal. This invest-<br />
ment is expected to result in approxi-<br /><br />
private development activity, the City is in mately 380 permanent jobs.<br />
the process of implementing several large-<br /><br />
scale public works projects. These include:<br /><br />
renovation of the pier, construction of<br />
a storage facility for mixing different<br />
grades of coal, and reorientation of the<br />
rail yards to allow more efficient coal<br />
delivery. To speed coal delivery<br />
Consolidation Coal Co. will bring coal<br /><br />

trial uses. When completed Holabird is<br />
expected to provide 2,500-to-3,000<br />
jobs. In 1982 the federal government<br />
approved the City’s application for a<br />
20-acre Foreign Trade Zone.<br />
McCormick Properties was selected by<br />
the City to develop and operate a 20-<br />
acre Foreign Trade Zone located in the<br />
northwest corner of the industrial park.<br />
<br />
Among other benefits a Foreign Trade<br />
Zone allows components from over-<br />
seas to be assembled in this country at<br />
a reduced import duty. This encour-<br />
ages new industries to establish assem-<br />
bly plants in the zone and provide new<br />
jobs and property taxes in Baltimore.<br />
<br />
*Canton Seagirt Marine Terminal -<br />
<br />
Dredge spoil from the excavation for<br />
the 1-95 Fort McHenry Tunnel has<br />
been used to create 147 acres of new<br />
waterfront land between the Sea Land<br />
Service container terminal and the<br />
Western Electric Co. The Maryland<br />
Port Administration will develop the<br />
site into the Port’s second largest con-<br />
tainer terminal. It will include three<br />
new 1,000 foot long berths and an<br />
extension of the existing Sea Land<br />
service berth. The MPA has estimated<br />
in 1982 that it will cost $123 million to<br />
develop the new terminal. This invest-<br />
ment is expected to result in approxi-<br />
<br />
private development activity, the City is in mately 380 permanent jobs.<br />
the process of implementing several large-<br />
<br />
scale public works projects. These include:<br />
<br />
renovation of the pier, construction of<br />
a storage facility for mixing different<br />
grades of coal, and reorientation of the<br />
rail yards to allow more efficient coal<br />
delivery. To speed coal delivery<br />
Consolidation Coal Co. will bring coal<br />
<br />
*Expressway and street improvements -<br />
Completion of Interstate 95 will offer a<br />
dramatic improvement in transporta-<br />

lssues and Problems<br /><br />
While there are important opportuni-<br />
ties for future development in Canton,<br />
there are also significant problems which<br />
must be overcome if the area is to realize<br />
its full development potential. Among<br />
these are:<br /><br />
*Traffic Congestion - Completion of<br />
Interstate-95 should reduce one of<br />
the major problems that has plagued<br />
Canton for years: truck traffic using<br />
local streets in surrounding residential<br />
communities.<br /><br />
However, several other transportation<br />
problems may persist in the future,<br />
most notably heavy traffic congestion<br />
on many of industrial Canton’s streets.<br />
This problem results from several<br />
factors: the large number of people<br /><br />
“employed in the area, the emptying of<br />
traffic into the area from the Harbor<br />
Tunnel Thruway and from Interstate-<br />
95, the queuing up of trucks waiting to<br />
unload cargo at the area’s many piers,<br />
and the large number of railroads that<br />
cross congested streets.<br /><br />
The planned construction of new<br />
streets and the widening and recon-<br />
struction of existing streets are<br />
designed to help reduce congestion<br />
and to give motorists alternative<br />
routes. However, the proposed expan-<br />
sion of General Motors, the develop-<br />
ment of Holabird Industrial Park,<br /><br />
the recently completed berth at the<br /><br />
t<br /><br />
Dundalk Marine Terminal, and the<br />
development of the Canton Seagirt<br />
Terminal are expected to bring addi-<br />
tional traffic into the area further con-<br />
tributing to the congestion problem.<br />
To help accommodate this new traffic<br />
several further street improvements<br />
may be needed in the future.<br /><br />
*Rail Problems - The Canton area con-<br /><br />
tains an extensive rail network. Both<br />
Conrail and the CSX Railroad maintain<br />
yards in the area for direct delivery to<br />
local industrial and port users. Trains<br />
are switched between these two major<br />
lines and moved to business loading<br />
docks by the Canton Railroad. The<br />
most important rail issue facing Canton<br />
concerns the future of this small<br />
switching railroad. The continued<br />
operation of a switching railroad is<br />
critical to a number of the area’s indus-<br />
tries. It is anticipated that the recent<br />
purchase of the Canton Railroad<br />
assures the area of service in the<br />
future.<br /><br />
Several other issues also face Canton’s<br />
rail system. Traffic bottlenecks created<br />
by at-grade rail crossings on Boston<br />
Street, Newkirk Street (near Holabird<br />
Avenue and near Newgate Street),<br />
Ponca Street, Holabird Avenue, and<br />
Newgate Street pose transportation<br />
problems for the area. The at-grade-<br />
crossing at Boston Street is especially<br />
hampering. Six tracks cross Boston<br />
Street at-grade and the B &amp; O bridge,<br />
which has an 11 foot clearance from<br />
the roadway, adds to the difficulties.<br />
Increased coal shipment for the<br />
Consolidation Coal Terminal may<br />
aggravate’this situation. Besides these<br />
rail/auto conflicts, the rail system itself<br />
suffers from several serious operational<br />
problems.<br /><br />
*Environmental Problems - Canton also<br /><br />
faces several environmental problems.<br />
The absence of public sewers in west<br />
Canton means that industries must<br />
provide their own treatment systems or<br />
discharge into the harbor. While<br />
environmentally necessary, installing a<br />
package treatment system is costly. This<br />
added capital expense can discourage<br />
firms interested in locating or expand-<br />
ing in the area. Given Canton’s close-<br />
ness to the harbor and the area’s high<br />
water table, there is also some ques-<br />
tion as to whether existing septic<br />
systems can offer adequate protection<br />
against soil contamination. On the<br />
other hand, extending sewer lines to<br />
west Canton would be particularly<br />
costly for the City because no federal<br />
funding is available for providing sewer<br />
lines to private industries.<br /><br />
Canton’s other environmental problem<br />
is meeting federal air quality standards.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Like much of Baltimore, Canton is<br />
classified a ‘“‘non-attainment” area. A<br />
main cause of Canton’s air pollution is<br />
the dust and other particles raised<br />
from unpaved or deteriorated road-<br />
beds, construction activity, open<br />
storage and transfer of commodities<br />
like coal and chemicals, and open,<br />
unkempt land. This source of pollution<br />
should be significantly reduced once<br />
construction activity is completed on<br />
Interstate-95 and on the various devel-<br />
opment projects in Canton. It can also<br />
be alleviated through the planned<br />
implementation of relativgly inexpen-<br />
sive yet effective methods of control-<br />
ling particle emissions like covering<br />
bulk storage facilities and maintaining<br />
open land.<br /><br />
*Area Conditions — Another problem is<br />
the poor condition of some of the<br />
buildings and facilities in Canton. The<br />

Consolidation Coal Co.’s purchase in<br />
1980 of the 110-acre Canton Company’s<br />
holdings determined the future of Canton’s<br />
last major developable parcel. While there<br />
are several additional opportunities for<br />
private development in Canton, they are<br />
considerably more limited in scope.<br /><br />
*Lebanon Chemical Development Site -<br />
Lebanon Chemical Co., which pres-<br />
ently operates at two separate sites in<br />
Canton, plans to consolidate all its<br />
operations to its southernmost location<br />
at 2600 South Clinton Street, leaving its<br />
other property at 1800 South Clinton<br />
Street available for industrial redevel-<br />
opment. Before the three acre site<br />
could be marketed the deteriorated<br />
wooden building on the parcel would<br />
have to be demolished and cleared.<br /><br />
*Consolidation Coal Co. Clinton Street<br />
Parcel and Pier - Among the proper-<br />
ties purchased by the Consolidation<br />
Coal Co. were an unused 500-by-50<br />
foot pier at the foot of Holabird<br />
Avenue and a 30-acre parcel across<br />
Clinton Street. Neither are needed for<br />
the company’s coal export operations<br />
and so are potentially available for<br />
alternative development. One option<br />
would be to market them jointly as an<br />
industrial site with deep water access.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Another approach would be to<br />
develop the pier as a small facility for<br />
loading containers onto barges using<br />
the Clinton Street parcel as back-up<br />
storage space required for such an<br />
operation.<br /><br />
*Apex Oil Company Industrial Building<br />
- Several buildings acquired by the<br />
Apex Oil Company at the former<br />
ASARCO smelting site might be leased<br />
for industrial development. Of particu-<br />
lar interest is the largest structure, the<br />
400,000 square-foot tank building.<br /><br />
*Conrail Excess Land - Adjacent to its<br />
coal pier on South Clinton Street, Con-<br />
rail owns an elongated 16-acre tract of<br />
land which it currently uses for bulk<br />
commodity storage. This parcel could<br />
be marketed for industrial develop-<br />
ment. Alternatively, Rukert Terminals,<br />
Inc. has expressed interest in purchas-<br />
ing the site from Conrail and continu-<br />
ing to use it for bulk storage purposes.<br /><br />
*Other Sites<br /><br />
e former Exxon distribution terminal<br />
(10 acres +)<br /><br />
e Colgate warehouses and adjacent<br />
land (70 acres +)<br /><br />

1980 of the 110-acre Canton Company’s<br />
holdings determined the future of Canton’s<br />
last major developable parcel. While there<br />
are several additional opportunities for<br />
private development in Canton, they are<br />
considerably more limited in scope.<br />
<br />
*Lebanon Chemical Development Site -<br />
Lebanon Chemical Co., which pres-<br />
ently operates at two separate sites in<br />
Canton, plans to consolidate all its<br />
operations to its southernmost location<br />
at 2600 South Clinton Street, leaving its<br />
other property at 1800 South Clinton<br />
Street available for industrial redevel-<br />
opment. Before the three acre site<br />
could be marketed the deteriorated<br />
wooden building on the parcel would<br />
have to be demolished and cleared.<br />
<br />
*Consolidation Coal Co. Clinton Street<br />
Parcel and Pier - Among the proper-<br />
ties purchased by the Consolidation<br />
Coal Co. were an unused 500-by-50<br />
foot pier at the foot of Holabird<br />
Avenue and a 30-acre parcel across<br />
Clinton Street. Neither are needed for<br />
the company’s coal export operations<br />
and so are potentially available for<br />
alternative development. One option<br />
would be to market them jointly as an<br />
industrial site with deep water access.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Another approach would be to<br />
develop the pier as a small facility for<br />
loading containers onto barges using<br />
the Clinton Street parcel as back-up<br />
storage space required for such an<br />
operation.<br />
<br />
*Apex Oil Company Industrial Building<br />
- Several buildings acquired by the<br />
Apex Oil Company at the former<br />
ASARCO smelting site might be leased<br />
for industrial development. Of particu-<br />
lar interest is the largest structure, the<br />
400,000 square-foot tank building.<br />
<br />
*Conrail Excess Land - Adjacent to its<br />
coal pier on South Clinton Street, Con-<br />
rail owns an elongated 16-acre tract of<br />
land which it currently uses for bulk<br />
commodity storage. This parcel could<br />
be marketed for industrial develop-<br />
ment. Alternatively, Rukert Terminals,<br />
Inc. has expressed interest in purchas-<br />
ing the site from Conrail and continu-<br />
ing to use it for bulk storage purposes.<br />
<br />
*Other Sites<br />
<br />
e former Exxon distribution terminal<br />
(10 acres +)<br />
<br />
e Colgate warehouses and adjacent<br />
land (70 acres +)<br />
<br />

Industrial Activity: Four Hawkins Point<br />
manufacturing firms employ approximately<br />
1,600 persons. The largest W.R. Grace’s<br />
Davison Chemical Division with 770<br />
employees, produces automotive catalysts<br />
as well as silicon derivative products. SCM<br />
Corp.’s Glidden Pigments Group estab-<br />
lished its operations in Hawkins Point in<br />
1956 and today employs 676 persons. The<br />
company produces titanium dioxide pig-<br />
ments used in the manufacture of paints.<br />
U.S. Gypsum Co. with 160 employees pro-<br />
duces gypsum building material products,<br />
receiving barge shipments of production<br />
materials at its own pier. Finally, Atlantic<br />
Cement with 12 employees produces<br />
cement and concrete at its batching plant<br />
located on Chemical Road.<br /><br />
Wholesale and trucking firms are also a<br />
significant employer in Hawkins Point. Four<br />
companies provide 105 jobs. The trucking<br />
firms are concentrated south of Hawkins<br />
Point Road along the City/County<br />
boundary. e<br /><br />
&gt;<br /><br />
Hawkins Point is also the location of<br />
four landfill operations. Browning Ferris<br />
Industries, Inc. and SCM Corp. operate<br />
landfills on adjoining sites of 30.56 acres<br />
and 37.95 acres respectively.<br /><br />
The Maryland Environmental Service<br />
developed a facility to handle disposal of<br />
hazardous waste on approximately eight<br />
acres of land owned by the Maryland Port<br />
Administration at Thom’s Cove. The facility<br />
has now been designated to dispose of<br />
chromium waste from Allied Chemical’s<br />
plant in Baltimore City.<br /><br />
At the old Quarantine Station site the<br />
Maryland Port Administration operates a<br />
small facility to dispose of dredge spoil<br />
material from projects in the harbor<br /><br />
Port Activity: Despite close proximity<br />
to deep water channels, only one marine<br />
terminal operates in Hawkins Point. The<br />
terminal is owned by the Maryland Port<br />
Administration and is leased to Eastalco<br />
Aluminum Corporation which operates a<br />
facility for receipt, storage, and shipment of<br />
alumina to its smelting plant in Frederick<br />
County, Maryland. The terminal includes a<br />
30,000 ton silo used for storage of alumina<br />
and a CSX Railroad line which provides<br />
access to the pier. Twelve persons are<br />
employed at the Eastalco Terminal.<br /><br />
Both W.R. Grace and U.S. Gypsum<br />
receive a portion of their raw materials<br />
through the use of private piers.<br /><br /><br /><br />
SCM Glidden’s paint pigment plant<br /><br />
Residential Areas: Hawkins Point has<br />
historically never supported a very large<br />
residential community. For a number of<br />
years just over 100 residents occupied<br />
homes on approximately five acres of<br />
commercially zoned land between Hawkins<br />
Point Road and the Baltimore Beltway.<br />
With the development of the MES hazard-<br />
ous waste disposal facility the State set up<br />
funds to purchase these properties and<br />
allow residents to relocate out of the area.<br />
There are also several smaller clusters of<br />
houses on streets south of Hawkins Point<br />
Road.<br /><br />
Recreation Areas: Hawkins Point’s only<br />
major recreation area is Fort Armistead,<br />
built by the U.S. government in 1898 as one<br />
of the forts to defend the harbor during<br />
the Spanish American War. The fort is<br />
named after Colonel George Armistead,<br />
who served in the battle of Northpoint in<br />
the War of 1812. Baltimore City acquired<br />
the 46 acre tract from the government in<br />
1927 with the provision that the land be<br />
used exclusively for recreation purposes.<br /><br />
Approaching the fort from land there<br />
is a rather large, flat bow! of land rising to<br />
the remains of battlements. This drops<br />
rapidly to a seawall which is built along the<br />
entire shoreline. The remains of the fort<br />
are dominated by concrete gun mounts,<br />
platforms and ammunition storage<br />
chambers below.<br /><br />
The view from the battlements and sea-<br />
wall is exceptional. To the north and east<br />
are Bethlehem Steel’s Sparrows Point Plant<br />
and the confluence of the Patapsco River<br />
and Chesapeake Bay. Dominating the view<br />
to the west is the Francis Scott Key Bridge,<br />
offering a unique view of ships passing<br />
under the bridge.<br /><br />
Using special State funds, the City has<br />
made major improvements to Fort Armi-<br />
stead. A newly landscaped entrance road,<br />
expanded parking for visitors and a boat<br />
launch, a renovated pier and seawall, play<br />
equipment and picnic areas were dedicated<br />
in the summer of 1984. The park, although<br />
not well known, is well used for free boat<br />
launching, fishing, and by people who<br />
simply enjoy watching the port’s activities.<br /><br /><br /><br />

terminal is owned by the Maryland Port<br />
Administration and is leased to Eastalco<br />
Aluminum Corporation which operates a<br />
facility for receipt, storage, and shipment of<br />
alumina to its smelting plant in Frederick<br />
County, Maryland. The terminal includes a<br />
30,000 ton silo used for storage of alumina<br />
and a CSX Railroad line which provides<br />
access to the pier. Twelve persons are<br />
employed at the Eastalco Terminal.<br />
<br />
Both W.R. Grace and U.S. Gypsum<br />
receive a portion of their raw materials<br />
through the use of private piers.<br />

<br />
Residential Areas: Hawkins Point has<br />
historically never supported a very large<br />
residential community. For a number of<br />
years just over 100 residents occupied<br />
homes on approximately five acres of<br />
commercially zoned land between Hawkins<br />
Point Road and the Baltimore Beltway.<br />
With the development of the MES hazard-<br />
ous waste disposal facility the State set up<br />
funds to purchase these properties and<br />
allow residents to relocate out of the area.<br />
There are also several smaller clusters of<br />
houses on streets south of Hawkins Point<br />
Road.<br />
<br />
Recreation Areas: Hawkins Point’s only<br />
major recreation area is Fort Armistead,<br />
built by the U.S. government in 1898 as one<br />
of the forts to defend the harbor during<br />
the Spanish American War. The fort is<br />
named after Colonel George Armistead,<br />
who served in the battle of Northpoint in<br />
the War of 1812. Baltimore City acquired<br />
the 46 acre tract from the government in<br />
1927 with the provision that the land be<br />
used exclusively for recreation purposes.<br />
<br />
Approaching the fort from land there<br />
is a rather large, flat bow! of land rising to<br />
the remains of battlements. This drops<br />
rapidly to a seawall which is built along the<br />
entire shoreline. The remains of the fort<br />
are dominated by concrete gun mounts,<br />
platforms and ammunition storage<br />
chambers below.<br />
<br />
The view from the battlements and sea-<br />
wall is exceptional. To the north and east<br />
are Bethlehem Steel’s Sparrows Point Plant<br />
and the confluence of the Patapsco River<br />
and Chesapeake Bay. Dominating the view<br />
to the west is the Francis Scott Key Bridge,<br />
offering a unique view of ships passing<br />
under the bridge.<br />
<br />
Using special State funds, the City has<br />
made major improvements to Fort Armi-<br />
stead. A newly landscaped entrance road,<br />
expanded parking for visitors and a boat<br />
launch, a renovated pier and seawall, play<br />
equipment and picnic areas were dedicated<br />
in the summer of 1984. The park, although<br />
not well known, is well used for free boat<br />
launching, fishing, and by people who<br />
simply enjoy watching the port’s activities.<br />

Planned Development<br /><br />
Baltimore City Landfill. The City has<br />
purchased approximately 142 acres from<br />
the W.R. Grace Co. to develop as a domes-<br />
tic landfill. The site located north of<br />
Hawkins Point Road and between Quaran-<br />
tine and Chemical Roads should provide<br />
the City with landfill capacity for 10 to 20<br />
years.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Issues and Problems<br /><br />
Two projects in Anne Arundel County<br />
outside the boundaries of Hawkins Point<br />
promise to have an impact on the area’s<br />
future. The first development project in<br />
Anne Arundel County affecting the future<br />
of Hawkins Point is the Brandon Shores<br />
Power Generating Station being built by<br />
the Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. The .<br />
station will contain two coal fired units,<br />
one scheduled to go into operation in<br />
1984, the other in 1987. When both units<br />
are running, they will burn 2.5-million tons<br />
of coal per year. In addition, two oil-<br />
powered generating units at the Wagner<br />
Power Plant immediately adjacent to<br />
Brandon Shores are being overhauled for<br />
coal use. After the conversion is completed<br />
by 1990, the Wagner Station will require 1.2<br />
million tons of coal per year.<br /><br />
Coal barge passing Bethlehem Steel’s Sparrows Point plant<br /><br />
Plans call for coal to be brought to<br />
both generating stations by barge. The<br />
second project also involves the Baltimore<br />
Gas and Electric Co. A subsidiary plans to<br />
develop an industrial park on land owned<br />
by B.G.&amp;E.<br /><br />
Rail Issues: Pennington Avenue is the<br />
only route into Hawkins Point and Marley<br />
Neck from the north. The anticipated<br />
increase in the number of trains to service<br />
new industry could block access not only<br />
for employees and trucks, but also for<br />
emergency vehicles. Grade separation at<br />
this point will be a high priority to the City,<br />
but will be costly.<br /><br />
In addition, Glidden, Gypsum, Cosmin<br />
and Kennecott could all be blocked by<br />
train movement across grade crossings lead-<br />
ing to their properties. Further, the CSX rail<br />
line crosses Curtis Creek into Hawkins<br />
Point via a swing bridge. When trains are<br />
crossing the bridge, Coast Guard vessels<br />
cannot move into the harbor from the<br />
Coast Guard Station further south on Curtis<br />
Creek. There has to be careful coordina-<br />
tion between the trains and the Coast<br />
Guard to prevent any delay in answering<br />
emergency calls from vessels in the harbor.<br /><br />
Traffic Issues: The City is planning<br />
improvements to Pennington Avenue.<br />
Improvements to portions of Hawkins Point<br />
Road have been completed and additional<br />
upgrading is projected for the future.<br /><br /><br /><br />

*Environmental Issues: Several environ-<br />
mental issues figure in the future of<br />
Hawkins Point. While connected to the<br />
City’s water supply and storm water<br />
systems, the area is without public sanitary<br />
sewers. This means that businesses in the<br />
area must maintain their own package (i.e.<br />
self-contained) treatment systems and resi-<br />
dences must use septic tanks. For busi-<br />
nesses that are considering locating in<br />
Hawkins Point, the prospect of having to<br />
install a package treatment system repre-<br />
sents an added development cost.<br /><br />
A federally-sponsored Areawide Waste-<br />
water Management Study has been com-<br />
pleted to assess the need for public sewer<br />
service in Hawkins Point. The study has<br />
concluded that public sewers are needed,<br />
there are a number of ways this need could<br />
be met, including connecting the area to<br />
the City’s Patapsco Wastewater Treatment<br />
+Plant in Fairfield, connecting it to the Cox<br />
Creek Plant in Anne Arundel County, and<br />
connecting the residential community to a<br />
sewer system at the U.S. Coast Guard<br />
Station. However, the unavailability of<br />
federal funds for extending sewer service<br />
to industrial areas leaves the burden of<br />
financing comprehensive sewer service to<br />
Hawkins Point to local jurisdictions.<br /><br />
As in other harbor areas, the develop-<br />
ment of a major coal terminal near<br /><br />
Dust clouds from unloading ore<br /><br />
]ay Steinhour<br /><br />
Hawkins Point requires that dust emissions<br />
from coal cars, coal piles, and loading and<br />
unloading operations be controlled. The<br />
State air quality agency believes that<br />
planned controls on the coal loading<br />
operations would sufficiently limit any<br />
emissions.<br /><br />
There is also concern over the leaking<br />
of pollutants into the bay from the Glidden<br />
Co.’s holding ponds. Acid, leaking through<br />
the dikes of:these ponds has reached the<br />
shallow water area along the shoreline of<br />
the plant. There has already been damage<br />

*Port-Related Issue: There are signifi-<br />

opment along the northern shoreline of<br />
Hawkins Poing because the land here has<br />
deep water access. However, the waters off<br />

uture Opportunities<br /><br />
Hawkins Point contains approximately<br />
400 acres of vacant land. There are four<br />
potential development sites in Hawkins<br />
Point:<br /><br />
*Three sites (90 acres, 179 acres, and 30<br />
acres) owned primarily by a subsidiary<br />
of the CSX Railroad.<br /><br />
*Two sites (30 acres and 132 acres) cur-<br />
rently owned by the W.R. Grace Co.<br />
but are to be purchased by the City for<br />
development as a landfill. Lhese sites<br />
will hold some development potential<br />
for light industry, warehousing and<br />
storage operations upon completion of<br />
the landfill operation.<br /><br />
If the three Chessie sites were<br />
marketed to attract industries which<br />
employ an average of 12 persons per acre,<br />
3,600 additional jobs would be created in<br />
Hawkins Point.<br /><br />
Several factors will influence how these<br />
parcels are developed. The CSX Railroad<br />
has expressed an interest in selling land to<br />
rail dependent activities. If this results in<br />
attracting storage and distribution uses, it is<br />
likely that lower levels of employment will<br />
result. The W.R. Grace sites present the<br />
most difficulty in terms of site preparation.<br />
While the other Hawkins Point develop-<br />
ment parcels are relatively flat, W.R.<br /><br />
Grace’s 132-acre southernmost parcel con-<br />
tains a 100-foot-high hill which must be<br />
regraded to allow the landfill to be devel-<br />
oped. One option for regrading would be<br />
to remove the majority of the hill on the<br />
southern site, selling the resulting six<br /><br />
million cubic yards of earth on the open<br />
market and to the Maryland Port Adminis-<br />
tration for fill. To strengthen the market for<br />
the excavated earth, the northern W.R.<br />
Grace parcel could be sold to the Maryland<br />
Port Administration for immediate use as a<br />
dredge spoil disposal site and for long-term<br />
development as a marine terminal capable<br />
of meeting projected port demand beyond<br />
the year 2000. This alternative would result<br />

uture Opportunities<br />
<br />
Hawkins Point contains approximately<br />
400 acres of vacant land. There are four<br />
potential development sites in Hawkins<br />
Point:<br />
<br />
*Three sites (90 acres, 179 acres, and 30<br />
acres) owned primarily by a subsidiary<br />
of the CSX Railroad.<br />
<br />
*Two sites (30 acres and 132 acres) cur-<br />
rently owned by the W.R. Grace Co.<br />
but are to be purchased by the City for<br />
development as a landfill. Lhese sites<br />
will hold some development potential<br />
for light industry, warehousing and<br />
storage operations upon completion of<br />
the landfill operation.<br />
<br />
If the three Chessie sites were<br />
marketed to attract industries which<br />
employ an average of 12 persons per acre,<br />
3,600 additional jobs would be created in<br />
Hawkins Point.<br />
<br />
Several factors will influence how these<br />
parcels are developed. The CSX Railroad<br />
has expressed an interest in selling land to<br />
rail dependent activities. If this results in<br />
attracting storage and distribution uses, it is<br />
likely that lower levels of employment will<br />
result. The W.R. Grace sites present the<br />
most difficulty in terms of site preparation.<br />
While the other Hawkins Point develop-<br />
ment parcels are relatively flat, W.R.<br />
<br />
Grace’s 132-acre southernmost parcel con-<br />
tains a 100-foot-high hill which must be<br />
regraded to allow the landfill to be devel-<br />
oped. One option for regrading would be<br />
to remove the majority of the hill on the<br />
southern site, selling the resulting six<br />
<br />
million cubic yards of earth on the open<br />
market and to the Maryland Port Adminis-<br />
tration for fill. To strengthen the market for<br />
the excavated earth, the northern W.R.<br />
Grace parcel could be sold to the Maryland<br />
Port Administration for immediate use as a<br />
dredge spoil disposal site and for long-term<br />
development as a marine terminal capable<br />
of meeting projected port demand beyond<br />
the year 2000. This alternative would result<br />
in a landfill to handle the City’s needs for a<br />
number of years and a 150-acre (30 acres of<br />
existing fastland; 120 acres of fill) site for a<br />
four-berth marine terminal. While this max-<br />
imum excavation approach would be costly<br />

Hawkins Point contains an important under-<br />
utilized recreation resource in Fort<br />
Armistead. Through a phased improvement<br />

Workers at Bethlehem Steel’s Fairfield yard, WW I<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
velopment History<br /><br />
Despite repeated attempts by land<br />
speculators to promote industrial and resi-<br />
dential development, Fairfield remained a<br />
rural, agricultural area until the late 19th<br />
century. Prior to that time the only signifi-<br />
cant development had been the founding<br />
of “Freetown,” reputedly the first settle-<br />
ment of free blacks in the eastern United<br />
States.<br /><br />
Two events opened Fairfield to wide-<br />
spread residential and industrial develop-<br />
ment. In 1878 the state bought the Light<br />
Street bridge from its private owner and<br />
eliminated its five cent toll thereby encou-<br />
raging residential development south of the<br />
Middle Branch. Then in 1882 the B&amp;O Rail-<br />
road extented its main line across the<br />
Middle Branch, through Brooklyn, and<br />
down to Curtis Bay. Almost immediately<br />
industrial development began. By the turn<br />
of the century the B&amp;O Railroad built a<br />
coal pier and four other companies opened<br />
plants.<br /><br />
The early 1900s saw a rapid expansion<br />
of industrial development, particularly of<br />
oil and chemical companies, metal pro-<br />
ducts manufacturers, and shipbuilding and<br />
repair yards. By 1918 when Fairfield was<br />
annexed to Baltimore City approximately<br />
2,000 were employed in area industries.<br /><br /><br /><br />
In conjunction with this industrial<br />
development four residential communities<br />
took root: Brooklyn, Curtis Bay, Old Fair-<br />
field, and East Brooklyn (today known as<br />
Wagner’s Point). Most of these began as<br />
clusters of company sponsored housing.<br /><br />
The next major spurt in development<br />
occurred in the 1940s when the govern-<br />
ment established the largest shipyard on<br />
the East Coast in Fairfield to build Liberty<br />
and Victory ships for the war effort. During<br />
the course of the war more than 500 vessels<br />
were built and launched at the Fairfield<br />
yards. Between 1940 and 1944 most of the<br />
remaining vacant land in Fairfield was<br />
developed into new housing for workers,<br />
storage yards, and the expansion of indus-<br />
tries related to the war effort.<br /><br />
After the war the land occupied by the<br />
shipyard was returned to its private owners<br />
and wartime housing was either torn down<br />
or converted to public housing. (Fairfield<br />
Homes was established in this way.) The<br />
end of the war also saw the development<br />
of extensive tank farms in Fairfield and the<br />
completion in 1957 of the Harbor Tunnel<br />
Thruway which linked Fairfield to the inter-<br />
state highway system and the eastern<br />
seaboard.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Existing Conditions<br /><br />
Industrial Activity: 57 industries are<br />
located in Fairfield: 12 are involved in pet-<br />
roleum storage and refining, 10 in chemical<br />
manufacturing, and 24 are involved in<br />
commodity storage and distribution. Practi-<br />
cally all the rest are engaged in metal<br />
manufacture and fabrication, shipbuilding<br />
and repair, and general manufacturing.<br /><br />
*Chemical Manufacture - Most of Fair-<br />
field’s 10 chemical manufacturers are<br />
located south of the Harbor Tunnel<br />
Thruway crossing. The three largest<br />
firms are FMC Corp., proﬁ'ucer of<br />
organic chemicals and pesticides, with<br />
395 employees; Conoco Chemicals,<br />
maker of detergents and alkalytes, with<br />
182 employees; and Alcolac Corp.,<br />
manufacturer of detergents, with 160<br />
employees.<br /><br />
*Petroleum Storage and Refining - Pet-<br />
roleum companies maintain two types<br />
of operations in Fairfield: tank farms<br />
and asphalt refineries. Fairfield contains<br />
the largest concentration of tank farms<br />
of any area on the Baltimore harbor.<br />
Oil storage facilities, maintained by<br />
eight oil companies, occupy over 300<br />
acres in Fairfield. The tanks store both<br />
light fuels (gasoline, home heating oil,<br />
kerosene, and jet fuel) which can be<br />
piped into the area through the Colon-<br />
ial Pipeline and heavy fuels (used in<br />
manufacturing processes and power<br />
plants) which are too thick to be<br />
moved by pipeline and must be ship-<br />
ped by barge. In addition to the tank<br />
farms, Fairfield contains three asphalt<br />
plants which serve a regional market.<br />
Crude oil used in asphalt production is<br />
brought to these plants by barge or<br />
ship while the asphalt is distributed by<br />
truck or rail.<br /><br />
*Metals Manufacture and Fabrication -<br />
Seven firms engage in metal fabrica-<br />
tion. The largest, Bethlehem Steel’s<br />
Buffalo Tank Division, employs 175<br />
persons in the production of steel<br />
tanks ranging from fuel tanks used by<br />
gasoline stations to nuclear reactor<br />
shields. Another firm, American Seam-<br />
less Tubing Corp., was acquired by<br />
Copperweld, Inc. and is expected to<br />
expand from 60 to 200 employees:<br />
American Seamless produces drill bits<br />
and equipment for drilling gas and oil<br />
wells.<br /><br />
*Shipbuilding and Repairing - The<br />
largest employer in Fairfield for a<br />
number of years was the Maryland<br />
Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at<br />
its Frankfurst Avenue Facility. Maryland<br />
Shipbuilding and Drydock announced<br />
in 1984 that it was closing its operation.<br /><br />
The facility is currently for sale. Fair-<br />
field’s other ship repair firm is the<br />
American Dredging Company which<br />
specializes in the maintenance of<br />
dredging vessels. It employs 17<br />
persons.<br /><br />
*Commodity Storage and Distribution -<br /><br />
Three distinct categories of commodi-<br />
ties are stored and distributed at Fair-<br />
field facilities.<br /><br />
General Merchandise. Low rents and<br />
excellent transportation have made<br />
Fairfield a favorite location for storing<br />
or warehousing a wide variety of pro-<br />
ducts including automobiles, lumber,<br />
steel, and plastics. The largest storage<br />
operation is the Hobelmann Corp.,<br />
which imports and stores automobiles<br />
at its Fairfield facility.<br /><br />
Many small firms lease space in the<br />
long row of warehouses operated by<br />
Harris Heller Terminals between Curtis<br />
and Pennington Avenues and in the<br />
Empire Industrial Center on Benbhill<br />
Avenue.<br /><br />
Solid Bulk Commodities. Three com-<br />
panies store ore and coal in Fairfield.<br />
The CSX Railroad runs both an ore<br />
import yard and a coal export yard on<br />
Curtis Bay. The Island Creek Co. oper-<br />
ates a coal storage and export facility at<br />
Curtis Bay. Overflow at the ore import<br />
facility is stored by the Joseph Hock<br />
Co. at its yard on Northbridge Avenue.<br /><br />
Liquid Bulk Commodities. Besides pet-<br />
roleum, two other liquid commodities<br />
are stored and distributed in Fairfield.<br />
Skyline Terminals, acquired in 1981 by<br />
W.R. Grace Co., handles commodities<br />
for the food and chemical processing<br />
industries. Allied Chemical operates a<br />
terminal which receives chemicals<br />
shipped by barge.<br /><br />
*General Manufacturing - Two sizeable<br /><br />
brick manufacturers operate plants in<br />
Fairfield. Harbison-Walker Refractories<br />
on Patapsco Avenue and General<br />
Refractories on Chesapeake Avenue.<br /><br />
Residential Areas: Surrounded by Fair-<br />
field’s heavy industry are three residential<br />
communities.<br /><br />
*Old Fairfield - This cluster of homes<br /><br />
dates back to the turn of the century<br />
when housing was often built on<br />
industiral land. Currently, this small<br />
black community of about 200 resi-<br />
dents is characterized by industrial<br />
encroachment, unpaved or deterio-<br />
rated streets, vacant houses and lots,<br />
poor street lighting and limited public<br />
transportation. In 1977 the City<br />
extended a sewer line into the area to<br />
service the scattered homes. However,<br />
the operations of a number of the sur-<br /><br />
56<br /><br />
rounding industries, heavily impact the<br />
residents in this area, which has been<br />
industrially zoned since 1931. Residents<br />
who wish to leave the area may<br />
request the City to purchase their<br />
homes and for assistance in relocation.<br /><br />
*Fairfield Homes - Built during World<br /><br />
War Il to house workers for Fairfield’s<br />
wartime industries, Fairfield Homes was<br />
converted to public housing after the<br />
war. Today Fairfield Homes houses<br />
1,002 residents. Bordered north and<br />
south by streets with heavy truck traffic<br />
and separated from the nearest shop-<br />
ping areas by industry and a major<br />
railyard, the community is subject to<br />
high levels of noise and dust. There is<br />
also the difficult and dangerous situa-<br />
tion of having to cross railroad tracks<br />
and highways to reach the nearest<br />
commerical area. In an effort-to<br />
upgrade the community facilities, the<br />
recreation center has been improved<br />
and the playground rebuilt with a“<br />
special grant from the federal Coastal<br />
Energy Impact Program.<br /><br />
*Wagner’s Point - This three-block long,<br /><br />
working class community of 255 resi-<br />
dents originated as housing for<br />
employees of nearby industry.<br />
Bordered on one side by a heavily-<br />
used industrial road and on the other<br />
side by tank farms, Wagner’s Point<br />
consists of approximately 85 row-<br />
houses. The streets in the community<br />
are in generally good repair and the<br />
City maintains a small playground.<br /><br />
Besides the three communities on the<br />
peninsula itself, two others — Brooklyn<br />
and Curtis Bay — border Fairfield on<br />
the northwest and west respectively.<br />"," <br />

|ssues and Problems<br /><br />
The future presents a number<br /><br />
of unresolved issues for Fairfield:<br /><br />
*Land Use Issues - Because of the scar-<br /><br />
city of developable land in Fairfield, it<br />
has been suggested that some of the<br />
peninsula’s many tank farms be relo-<br />
cated elsewhere. The proposal is<br />
prompted by a number of factors. First,<br />
it is supposed that oil distributors who<br />
are not dependent on waterborne<br />
deliveries could just as well locate on<br />
peripheral sites in the region further<br />
inland along the Colonial Pipeline.<br />
Second, it is speculated that industrial<br />
or port-related development of the<br />
tank farm sites would yield greater<br />
economic benefits to the city in the<br />
form of taxes and jobs.<br /><br />
It has been found, however, that not<br />
only would it be extremely costly to<br />
relocate the tanks (estimated at more<br />
than $50 million for relocating five<br />
million barrels of storage capacity), but<br />
also even those distributors who could<br />
obtain all their oil through the Colon-<br />
ial Pipeline prefer to retain the flexibil-<br />
ity of being able to receive oil by ship<br />
if necessary.<br /><br />
A second land use issue facing Fairfield<br />
revolves around the conflict between<br />
residential and industrial activity. The<br />
entire Fairfield peninsula is zoned for<br /><br />
Jay Steinhour<br /><br />
the heaviest allowable industrial activ-<br />
ity. This creates problems for the<br />
peninsula’s residential communities<br />
which experience elevated levels of air<br />
and noise pollution, truck traffic, and<br />
industrial encroachment. It also puts<br />
the City in the difficult position of hav-<br />
ing to decide whether to fund<br />
extremely costly projects that will<br />
shore up the residential communities<br />
or to encourage the conversion of the<br />
entire area to industrial activities.<br /><br />
For example, Old Fairfield contains<br />
many vacant lots, deteriorated and<br />
empty buildings, unpaved streets, and<br />
homes that are still not connected to<br />
the public sewer line. Furthermore,<br />
residents have had to witness the<br />
steady spread of Brooklyn Salvage, an<br />
automotive junkyard which has<br />
extended its operations onto vacant<br />
lots and public streets.<br /><br />
The City faces a dilemma. On the one<br />
hand, it could provide new streets and<br />
street lighting, require residents to<br />
hook up to the new sewer line at sub-<br />
stantial private costs, and turn back<br />
Brooklyn Salvage’s expansion by strictly<br />
enforcing the City codes. On the other<br />
hand, the City could encourage the<br />
conversion of the area to its currently<br />
zoned industrial activity by helping<br />
residents relocate. The difficulty is that<br />
some residents have expressed a desire<br />
to move to newer housing outside<br />
Fairfield while others would like to<br />
remain in the area and want the City<br />
to improve services in the community.<br />
The City has offered to purchase the<br />
property of residents who wish to<br />
relocate out of the industrial area. This<br />
conflict is one of the outstanding issues<br />
in the future of Fairfield.<br /><br />
*Traffic Issues — Located at the first<br /><br />
interchange south of the Harbor<br />
Tunnel Thruway toll plaza, Fairfield is<br />
linked to the eastern seaboard by the<br />
Tunnel Thruway. Besides the Thruway,<br />
three major streets (Frankfurst,<br />
Patapsco, and Pennington Avenues)<br />
connect the Fairfield peninsula to the<br />
city amd region. All three streets, which<br />
are heavily travelled today, will<br />
experience increased congestion with<br />
the development of the Masonville<br />
Marine Terminal, Island Creek Coal<br />
Terminal, and future rail-oriented<br />
industry south of Fairfield in Marley<br />
Neck. Particular troublespots occur at<br />
the junction of the Harbor Tunnel<br />
Thruway ramps and Frankfurst Avenue<br />
and at the intersection of Birch Street<br />
and Pennington Avenue where north-<br />
bound traffic routed off Pennington<br />
Avenue onto Curtis Avenue is forced<br />
to make two sharp turns. These two<br /><br /><br /><br />

turns are particularly difficult for trucks<br />
to negotiate.<br /><br />
Possible construction of new or<br />
improved ramps from the Harbor<br />
Tunnel Thruway directly into Mason-<br />
ville Terminal should help relieve the<br />
first of these problems. Resolution of<br />
the second problem has been<br />
addressed by the redesign of Birch<br />
Street and acquisition of several pro-<br /><br />
perties so that the connection between<br />
Pennington and Curtis Avenues can be<br /><br />
realigned.<br /><br />
*Rail Issues - Three branches of the CSX<br /><br />
Railroad serve the Fairfield geninsula.<br /><br />
While this provides good rail access for<br /><br />
the area’s industries and port facilities,<br />
the train tracks often cross heavily<br />
travelled streets causing traffic tie-ups.<br />
This represents a particular problem<br />
where tracks cross the only route into<br />
an area such as on Pennington<br />
Avenue, the only road into Hawkins<br />
Point from the north, and on Benhill<br />
Avenue the only street serving twelve<br />
firms and their 600 employees east of<br />
Curtis Avenue. The frequency of traffic<br />
tie-ups at grade-level railroad crossings<br />
will increase with the development of<br />
new industrial uses on Malley Neck<br />
especially if these are rail oriented uses<br />
as encouraged by the principal land<br /><br />
owner, the CSX Railroad. Resolving this<br /><br />
possible problem in the future will<br />
require the attention of the City as<br />
well as the CSX Railroad.<br /><br />
*Environmental Issues — The increase in<br />
rail activity due to the growth of coal<br />
exports will also contribute to noise<br />
and air pollution and safety issues. The<br />
City has already begun to address the<br />
latter problem at Fairfield Homes by<br />
constructing improved recreational<br />
facilities which do not require resi-<br />
dents to cross railroad tracks to use<br />
playfields in adjacent communities.<br />
This project is being funded under the<br />
Coastal Energy Impact Program, a<br />
federal program designed to reduce<br />
the impacts of energy resources on<br />
recreational facilities and residential<br />
communities. The air pollution prob-<br />
lem caused by particles released when<br />
coal is transported, loaded, and<br />
unloaded will require the railroads and<br />
the exporters to rigorously put into”<br />
practice techniques designed to con-<br />
trol dust emissions. Methods such as<br />
covering or soaking piles have proven<br />
effective and economical. Other<br />
sources of particulate pollution, open<br />
storage piles, unkept vacant land and<br />
unpaved roads can be controlled<br />
through relatively inexpensive<br /><br />
methods. This can significantly improve<br /><br />
air quality and the development desir-<br />
ability of an industrial area.<br /><br />
Conjestion at Fairfield Homes, stored trailers, trucks, parked cars<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Future Opportunities<br /><br />
There is little land in Fairfield available<br />
for new development. All but one of the<br />
developable sites identified in the accom-<br />
panying map are presently used for stor-<br />
age. Since storage facilities are often neces-<br />
sary to support port and industrial activities,<br />
it is not clear whether or when those sites<br />
might be available for development.<br />
Futhermore, two of the sites identified are<br />
adjacent to residential communities which<br />
could limit the kinds of manufacturing<br />
activities that could be located on the sites.<br />
The one vacant site identified as having<br />
development potential is adjacent and<br />
immediately south of the Patapsco Waste<br />
Water Treatment Plant. It contains<br />
approximately 20 acres and affords deep-<br />
water access.<br /><br />
There may also be some development<br />
opportunity available from approximately<br />
20 acres of vacant and underutilized land at<br />
the former Olin Mathieson factory.<br /><br />
In early 1984 the Fruehauf Corp. put its<br />
50 acre Maryland Shipbuilding and Dry-<br />
dock Co. on the market. Located on the<br />
northern shoreline of Fairfield adjacent to<br />
MPA’s planned Masonville Marine Termi-<br />
nal, the site offers possibilities as continuing<br />
to function as a shipbuilding facility or<br />
conversion to a specialized terminal.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
The Weyerhaeuser Co. has also placed<br />
its facility up for lease or sale. Located<br />
adjacent to the Maryland Shipbuilding site,<br />
the properties could offer an almost 80<br />
acre parcel for development.<br /><br />
Besides these limited opportunities for<br />
industrial development, there is a possibil-<br />
ity of creating a park and green open space<br />
on the Pennington Avenue landfill located<br />
on the southwest border of Fairfield. The<br />
70-acre landfill which had been used for<br />
demolition debris, incinerator ash and<br />
domestic waste was closed in 1981. A park<br />
and natural green space is planned as<br />
recreational resource for the Curtis Bay<br />
community.<br /><br /><br /><br />
60<br />"," <br />
<br />
turns are particularly difficult for trucks<br />
to negotiate.<br />
<br />
Possible construction of new or<br />
improved ramps from the Harbor<br />
Tunnel Thruway directly into Mason-<br />
ville Terminal should help relieve the<br />
first of these problems. Resolution of<br />
the second problem has been<br />
addressed by the redesign of Birch<br />

effective and economical. Other<br />
sources of particulate pollution, open<br />
storage piles, unkept vacant land and<br />
unpaved roads can be controlled<br />
through relatively inexpensive<br />
<br />
methods. This can significantly improve<br />

air quality and the development desir-<br />
ability of an industrial area.<br />

Future Opportunities<br />
<br />
There is little land in Fairfield available<br />
for new development. All but one of the<br />
developable sites identified in the accom-<br />
panying map are presently used for stor-<br />
age. Since storage facilities are often neces-<br />
sary to support port and industrial activities,<br />
it is not clear whether or when those sites<br />
might be available for development.<br />
Futhermore, two of the sites identified are<br />
adjacent to residential communities which<br />
could limit the kinds of manufacturing<br />
activities that could be located on the sites.<br />
The one vacant site identified as having<br />
development potential is adjacent and<br />
immediately south of the Patapsco Waste<br />
Water Treatment Plant. It contains<br />
approximately 20 acres and affords deep-<br />
water access.<br />
<br />
There may also be some development<br />
opportunity available from approximately<br />
20 acres of vacant and underutilized land at<br />
the former Olin Mathieson factory.<br />
<br />
In early 1984 the Fruehauf Corp. put its<br />
50 acre Maryland Shipbuilding and Dry-<br />
dock Co. on the market. Located on the<br />
northern shoreline of Fairfield adjacent to<br />
MPA’s planned Masonville Marine Termi-<br />
nal, the site offers possibilities as continuing<br />
to function as a shipbuilding facility or<br />
conversion to a specialized terminal.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Weyerhaeuser Co. has also placed<br />
its facility up for lease or sale. Located<br />
adjacent to the Maryland Shipbuilding site,<br />
the properties could offer an almost 80<br />
acre parcel for development.<br />
<br />
Besides these limited opportunities for<br />
industrial development, there is a possibil-<br />
ity of creating a park and green open space<br />
on the Pennington Avenue landfill located<br />
on the southwest border of Fairfield. The<br />
70-acre landfill which had been used for<br />
demolition debris, incinerator ash and<br />
domestic waste was closed in 1981. A park<br />
and natural green space is planned as<br />
recreational resource for the Curtis Bay<br />
community.<br />

Boating on the Middle Branch, 1920’s<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
velopment History<br /><br />
Settlers in the middle of the 18th cen-<br />
tury found iron ore in the areas adjacent to<br />
the Middle Branch and erected an iron<br />
furnace at the mouth of what is now the<br />
Gwynns Falls. This area was also the site of<br />
the City’s first brickyards producing mate-<br />
rials for many of Baltimore’s early<br />
structures.<br /><br />
The rich marshes, and an abundance<br />
of shad, herring, perch, and rockfish, and a<br />
wooded shoreline attracted visitors from all<br />
over the City. By the early 1800s the Middle<br />
Branch became an important recreation<br />
area for the growing City of Baltimore.<br />
Fletcher’s Fish House and a public beer<br />
garden at the foot of Howard Street estab-<br />
lished in the early 1800s were the first of<br />
numerous commercial recreational uses.<br /><br />
By the mid-1800s the area began to<br />
attract industrial uses. Baltimore’s Gas Light<br />
Co. and Western Maryland Railroad’s Port<br />
Covington Yard were established in the<br />
1850s. Other development along the north<br />
and northwest shores during the mid-19th<br />
century included a few breweries, coal<br />
yards, and a glass factory.<br /><br />
In 1916 the Hanover Street Bridge<br />
opened and spurred residential and indus-<br />
trial development of Brooklyn, Fairfield, and<br />
Hawkins Point. Three years later these areas<br />
were annexed to the City. In 1924, the<br />
Western Maryland Railroad completed the<br /><br />
existing bridge across the Middle Branch.<br />
Cherry Hill was developed by the City as a<br />
residential community in the 1930s and 40s.<br /><br />
During the early 1970s three major<br />
property owners along the shoreline<br />
applied to the Corps of Engineers for per-<br />
mits to expand their land area by filling<br />
portions of the Middle Branch. BG&amp;E at its<br />
Spring Gardens Facility requested to fill<br />
seven acres. Baltimore City requested to fill<br />
10 acres with demolition material at the<br />
Central Garage. Carr-Lowery on the west-<br />
ern shoreline needed to fill and improve its<br />
waterfront to improve plant operations.<br />
During the federal review process the<br />
Department of Interior requested a com-<br />
prehensive look at the impacts of these<br />
three permits on the long-range plans for<br />
use of the waterfront and water quality.<br />
Interior also expresseed concern over the<br />
cumulative impacts of these projects com-<br />
bined with the construction of the inter-<br />
change of Interstate 95 and 395 directly<br />
over the Middle Branch.<br /><br />
In response to these concerns the<br />
City’s Department of Planning in 1977<br />
issued the Middle Branch Park Plan, which<br />
called for the creation of Baltimore’s largest<br />
shoreline park along portions of the<br />
perimeter of the Middle Branch and coor-<br />
dination of activities around the waterfront.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
62<br /><br />
The plan included proposals for the crea-<br />
tion of boat launches, marinas, playfields,<br />
fishing piers, open green spaces, picnic<br />
areas, plus wetland-preservation-all linked<br />
together by a pedestrian/bikeway trail. A<br />
number of proposals have been carried<br />
out, including the completion of Ferry Bar<br />
Marine Park, Broening Park boat launch,<br />
first phases of the 115-acre Reedbird Park,<br />
removal of sunken boats and barges, and<br />
improvements to the sewer system in areas<br />
near the park.<br /><br />

xisting Conditions<br /><br />
The Middle Branch is surrounded by<br />
a variety of industrial and commerical<br />
activities, isolated residential communities,<br />
and parkland. Although water-related<br />
trade once played a role in the movement<br />
of goods, today only one industry still uses<br />
barges.<br /><br />
Industrial Activity: Several industries<br />
dominate the Middle Branch. Moving<br />
westward around the shoreline from the<br />
north side of the Hanover Street Bridge,<br />
the major industries include:<br /><br />
*City of Baltimore Central Garage -<br />
Used for the repair and storage of City<br />
vehicles, a portion of the property<br />
once served as a landfill for demolition<br /><br />
debris.<br /><br />
*Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Company’s<br />
Spring Garden Plant - B.G.&amp;E. stores<br />
gas at this location and manufactures<br />
steam for use in downtown buildings.<br />
This site was expanded in the late<br />
1970s by filling.<br /><br />
*Carroll Industrial Park - This area con-<br />
sists of parcels of vacant land and<br /><br />
many smaller industries. Using federal<br />
funds and the City’s Industrial Loan<br />
Program, improvements have been<br />
made to streets, parking, and lighting<br />
to attract industry in locating here.<br /><br />
*Northeast Municipal Waste Disposal<br />
Authority - The authority constructed<br />
an incinerator on the peninsula east of<br />
Russell Street, near the mouth of the<br />
Gwynns Falls. This facility is planned to<br />
handle a major portion of the area’s<br />
solid waste, while generating electricity<br />
to be sold to BG&amp;E.<br /><br />
*Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Westport<br />
Generating Station - This plant gene-<br />
rates electricity on an intermittent basis<br />
for the downtown area.<br /><br />
*Carr-Lowery Glass Manufacturing<br />
Company - The company employs<br />
1,200 persons in the production of<br />
glass bottles and jars.<br /><br />
Employment at Middle Branch indus-<br />
tries has been stable in the past and is<br />
expected to remain stable in the future.<br /><br />
Port Activity: Except for a few barges<br />
to the Baltimore Gas and Electric Co.<br /><br />
Westport Station, waterborne commerce is<br /><br />
non-existent along the Middle Branch.<br />
Although the Spring Garden Channel,<br />
which extends from the Hanover Street<br />
Bridge west and north to the Western<br />
Maryland Railroad bridge, was last<br />
dredged by the Corps of Engineers in<br /><br />
1960, it is still deep enough for the barges<br /><br />
and for pleasure boats. The responsibility<br />
for maintaining the channel belongs to<br />
the Corps of Engineers, which has no<br />

xisting Conditions<br />
<br />
The Middle Branch is surrounded by<br />
a variety of industrial and commerical<br />
activities, isolated residential communities,<br />
and parkland. Although water-related<br />
trade once played a role in the movement<br />
of goods, today only one industry still uses<br />
barges.<br />
<br />
Industrial Activity: Several industries<br />
dominate the Middle Branch. Moving<br />
westward around the shoreline from the<br />
north side of the Hanover Street Bridge,<br />
the major industries include:<br />
<br />
*City of Baltimore Central Garage -<br />
Used for the repair and storage of City<br />
vehicles, a portion of the property<br />
once served as a landfill for demolition<br />
<br />
debris.<br />
<br />
*Baltimore Gas & Electric Company’s<br />
Spring Garden Plant - B.G.&E. stores<br />
gas at this location and manufactures<br />
steam for use in downtown buildings.<br />
This site was expanded in the late<br />
1970s by filling.<br />
<br />
*Carroll Industrial Park - This area con-<br />
sists of parcels of vacant land and<br />
<br />
many smaller industries. Using federal<br />
funds and the City’s Industrial Loan<br />
Program, improvements have been<br />
made to streets, parking, and lighting<br />
to attract industry in locating here.<br />
<br />
*Northeast Municipal Waste Disposal<br />
Authority - The authority constructed<br />
an incinerator on the peninsula east of<br />
Russell Street, near the mouth of the<br />
Gwynns Falls. This facility is planned to<br />
handle a major portion of the area’s<br />
solid waste, while generating electricity<br />
to be sold to BG&E.<br />
<br />
*Baltimore Gas & Electric Westport<br />
Generating Station - This plant gene-<br />
rates electricity on an intermittent basis<br />
for the downtown area.<br />
<br />
*Carr-Lowery Glass Manufacturing<br />
Company - The company employs<br />
1,200 persons in the production of<br />
glass bottles and jars.<br />
<br />
Employment at Middle Branch indus-<br />
tries has been stable in the past and is<br />
expected to remain stable in the future.<br />
<br />
Port Activity: Except for a few barges<br />
to the Baltimore Gas and Electric Co.<br />
<br />
Westport Station, waterborne commerce is<br />
<br />
non-existent along the Middle Branch.<br />
Although the Spring Garden Channel,<br />
which extends from the Hanover Street<br />
Bridge west and north to the Western<br />
Maryland Railroad bridge, was last<br />
dredged by the Corps of Engineers in<br />
<br />
1960, it is still deep enough for the barges<br />
<br />
and for pleasure boats. The responsibility<br />
for maintaining the channel belongs to<br />
the Corps of Engineers, which has no<br />
plans to dredge it.<br />

Fishing at the Middle Branch Park<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Planned DeveIOpmeht<br /><br />
The Middle Branch Park Plan has been<br />
a great impetus to development in this<br />
area. Besides spurring a wide range of<br />
recreation-related improvements, it has<br />
provided an incentive for local businesses<br />
to upgrade the appearance of their proper-<br />
ties. Listed below are a number of activities<br />
which are either underway or expected to<br />
be initiated within a few years.<br /><br />
Private/Public: Most of the planned<br />
development on the Middle Branch will be<br />
publicly sponsored. However, there are<br />
also several joint public/private endeavors.<br /><br />
*Waterview Avenue Industrial Park -<br />
The City has designated approximately<br />
40 acres of land north of Cherry Hill<br />
and south of Waterview Avenue as an<br />
industrial urban renewal area. The area<br />
includes 22 manufacturing, warehous-<br />
ing, and retail firms employing over<br />
400 persons. Under the existing<br />
renewal plan businesses are expected<br />
to improve their properties to meet<br />
certain design standards. For its part<br />
the City has reconstructed the portion<br />
of Waterview Avenue north of the<br />
industrial park, widening the median<br />
and providing turn lanes into the busi-<br />
nesses. The new boulevard-styled road-<br />
way will be more in keeping with the<br />
improved industrial area to the south<br />
and the new park which will replace<br />
the junkyards to the north. Sewer ser-<br />
vice, several road construction and<br />
rehabilitation projects, and a landscape<br />
buffer along the south side of Water-<br />
view Avenue have been completed.<br /><br />
An urban renewal plan for the area,<br />
has been approved and recommends<br />
rezoning several properties and sets<br />
standards for new and existing devel-<br />
opment to promote an attractive set-<br />
ting compatible with the adjacent<br />
recreation park.<br /><br />
Marina and the Hanover Street Bridge<br /><br />
65<br /><br />
*Baltimore Rowing Club - The City will<br />
match private funds raised by the<br />
Baltimore Rowing Club to build a stor-<br />
age shed for its rowing shells meeting<br />
space on the south shore of the<br />
Middle Branch just west of the<br />
Hanover Street Bridge.<br /><br />
*Locke Insulators - Locke Insulators has<br />
received a permit to fill approximately<br />
1.5 acres of water which will allow the<br />
plant to expand operations and create<br /><br />
. approximately 100 new jobs. The per-<br />
mit was issued after Locke agreed to<br />
create a 1.5 acre wetland area at Reed-<br />
bird Park to compensate for the water<br />
habitat lost to the fill. Locke Insulator<br />
will also make improvements to the<br />
shoreline and the waterside of its<br />
buildipg.<br /><br />
Public: Much of the public effort cen-<br />
ters on continuing to implement the<br />
Middle Branch Park Plan. Projects that have<br />
been programmed include:<br /><br />
*Reedbird Park - The first phase of con-<br />
struction of this park has been com-<br />
pleted. The park now offers picnic<br />
areas, a shoreline trail, five fishing<br />
piers, athletic fields, a tot lot, tennis<br />
courts and a small stage and multi-use<br />
shelter. The second phase of the park,<br />
completed in 1982-3 includes addi-<br />
tional play equipment for small chil-<br />
dren, additional bike trails and side-<br />
walks for improved community access,<br />
multi-purpose fields, as well as land-<br />
scaping throughout the park. Com-<br />
posited sludge from the Back River<br />
Waste Water Treatment Plan has been<br />
used ‘at Reedbird Park as a soil condi-<br />
tioner to prepare the reclaimed landfill<br />
for planting grass and trees.<br /><br />
*New Waterview Avenue Interchange -<br />
By eliminating the section of Water-<br />
view Avenue that forks off from Potee<br />
Street and constructing a northbound<br />
connection onto Hanover Street, traffic<br />
safety has been improved and park-<br />
land, formerly cut off from the shore-<br />
line, has been tied directly to the<br />
waterfront. This project was completed<br />
in the summer of 1983.<br /><br />
*Southshore Open Space - Land for-<br />
merly occupied by several junkyards<br />
has been acquired by the City and will<br />
be converted to public open space.<br />
Relocation of the junkyards and clean-<br />
up began in 1983. An improved shore-<br />
line and landscaping should be com-<br />
pleted in 1985.<br /><br />
*Relocation Animal Shelter - The City’s<br />
old animal shelter, which was taken for<br />
the construction of the expressway,<br />
will be rebuilt on the northernmost<br />
shoreline of the Middle Branch.<br /><br /><br />","R<br />

Issues and Problems<br /><br />
The problems of the Middle Branch<br />
area fall into three major categories:<br /><br />
onflicting Land Use: First, there is a<br />
conflict between adjacent neighborhoods<br />
and the various junk yards, scrap metal<br />
operations, storage yards, and firms which<br />
often do not maintain a high standard of<br />
operation. Some of these problems have<br />
been addressed in the improvement pro-<br />
gram for Carroll Industrial Park in the<br />
northern portion of the Middle Branch.<br />
Also underway is the purchasg.of several<br />
auto scrapyards along Waterview Avenue<br />
which will greatly improve the area. The<br />
City also plans to work with a number of<br />
the firms in the Waterview Avenue indus-<br />
trial area to improve their level of opera-<br />
tion and appearance.<br /><br />
Another problem is the isolation of<br />
much of the recreational space from adja-<br />
cent communities and other recreational<br />
facilities. Industries often separate open<br />
space from neighborhoods, recreational<br />
facilities are fragmented and generally the<br />
parkland along the Middle Branch is under<br />
used. An example is the 15 acres of open<br />
space south of Waterview Avenue. This<br />
area is cut off from the Cherry Hill com-<br />
munity by a steep hill and roadway and<br />
from the rest of the park by Hanover<br />
Street. Plans call for tying this area together<br />
with the park by paths and bikeways.<br /><br />
Access: Traffic to most Middle Branch<br />
industries uses neighborhood streets in the<br />
Westport, Cherry Hill, and South Baltimore<br />
communities. The heavy truck traffic in<br />
these areas has created safety problems,<br />
divided parts of neighborhoods from one<br />
another, and generally lowered the live-<br />
ability of these areas through noise and<br />
exhaust pollution. The completion of 1-95<br />
and 1-395 is expected to relieve these prob-<br />
lems somewhat. However, many areas will<br />
still be burdened with undesirable levels of<br />
truck traffic. ’<br /><br />
Another access problem is the diffi-<br />
culty of reaching the open space along the<br />
shoreline, particularly the south shoreline<br />
in the vicinity of South Baltimore General<br />
Hospital. Heavily-travelled Hanover Street,<br />
Potee Street, and Waterview Avenue set up<br />
barriers between the Cherry Hill commun-<br />
ity and the waterfront. Even motorists find<br />
it difficult to reach the shoreline under the<br />
present street configuration. Better coordi-<br />
nation of traffic signals for pedestrians, the<br />
pathway under Hanover and Potee Streets,<br />
new sidewalks leading to the park, and a<br />
continuous bikeway should help reduce<br />
this problem.<br /><br />
Water Quality: For many years over-<br />
flow from inadequate sanitary sewers, dis-<br />
charges from industrial concerns; debris;<br />
and storm runoff carrying dirt, oil, and<br />
asphalt from city streets, turned the Middle<br />
Branch into an unpleasant, polluted water<br />
body which supports only the most min-<br />
imal forms of aquatic life. Deposits of silt,<br />
in several areas reaching a depth of 30 feet,<br />
is fused with heavy metals and other toxic<br />
substances, present limitations to develop-<br />
ment in certain areas. Activity in the water,<br />
poses the danger of stirring up these<br />
sediments.<br /><br />
Recently, steps have been taken to<br />
remedy the most severe aspects of the pol-<br />
lution problems. Completion of the South-<br />
west Diversion Main helped to curtail<br />
major sewage overflows and enabled many<br />
faulty septic tanks to be eliminated. Pro-<br />
posals to clean up the shoreline were<br />
included in the Carroll Industrial Park plan.<br />
The fill permits issued to the Baltimore Gas<br />
and Electric Co., Carr-Lowery, and the<br />
City’s Central Garage promote a cleaner<br />
and more stable shoreline by insuring that<br />
the type and amount of fill were<br />
monitored.<br /><br />
The combination of improved water<br />
quality, a stablilized shoreline free from<br />
debris, and adequate sanitary facilities pro-<br />
vides the basis for future water-oriented<br />
recreational activities on the Middle<br />
Branch.<br /><br />
Debris washed-up on the shoreline<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

uture Opportunities ‘<br /><br />
The Middle Branch Park Plan and the<br />
Waterview Avenue Industrial Park Plan<br />
have laid the basis for a number of signifi-<br />
cant future public and private development<br />
opportunities. Many of these are part of a<br />
long-range improvement plan and include:<br /><br />
*Reedbird Park Improvements - As<br />
funds become available, ballfields,<br />
landscaping, bikeways and pedestrian<br />
paths, boating facilities, and other<br />
recreational uses will be added to the<br />
park. Plans call for completion of the<br />
pathway from the play area at Hanover<br />
Street to run along the shoreline and<br />
connect into Baltimore County’s park<br />
and the Patapsco Valley State Park.<br />
There is also the possibility of operat-<br /><br />
ing a boat-rental facility in the<br />
enclosed portion of the river between<br />
Hanover Street Bridge and the B&amp; O<br />
Railroad bridge. Extensive landscaping<br />
for both the east and west portions of<br />
the park is planned. Proposals will also<br />
be developed for using the large hill in<br />
the park for a variety of active recrea-<br />
tional uses.<br /><br />
69<br /><br />
*Waterview Park - A master plan has<br /><br />
been prepared and accepted by the<br />
City for the shoreline area north of<br />
Waterview Avenue. The first phase of<br />
the plan is now underway. The City<br />
has acquired approximately 8.7 acres<br />
adjacent to a City-owned parcel of<br />
about 1.7 acres, totalling 10.4 acres for<br />
park development. The acquisition and<br />
relocation of several junkyards in the<br />

uture Opportunities ‘<br />
<br />
The Middle Branch Park Plan and the<br />
Waterview Avenue Industrial Park Plan<br />
have laid the basis for a number of signifi-<br />
cant future public and private development<br />
opportunities. Many of these are part of a<br />
long-range improvement plan and include:<br />
<br />
*Reedbird Park Improvements - As<br />
funds become available, ballfields,<br />
landscaping, bikeways and pedestrian<br />
paths, boating facilities, and other<br />
recreational uses will be added to the<br />
park. Plans call for completion of the<br />
pathway from the play area at Hanover<br />
Street to run along the shoreline and<br />
connect into Baltimore County’s park<br />
and the Patapsco Valley State Park.<br />
There is also the possibility of operat-<br />
<br />
ing a boat-rental facility in the<br />
enclosed portion of the river between<br />
Hanover Street Bridge and the B& O<br />
Railroad bridge. Extensive landscaping<br />
for both the east and west portions of<br />
the park is planned. Proposals will also<br />
be developed for using the large hill in<br />
the park for a variety of active recrea-<br />
tional uses.<br />
<br />
69<br />
<br />
*Waterview Park - A master plan has<br />
<br />
been prepared and accepted by the<br />
City for the shoreline area north of<br />
Waterview Avenue. The first phase of<br />
the plan is now underway. The City<br />
has acquired approximately 8.7 acres<br />
adjacent to a City-owned parcel of<br />
about 1.7 acres, totalling 10.4 acres for<br />
park development. The acquisition and<br />
relocation of several junkyards in the<br />
area was-completed by the summer of<br />
<br />
11983. All acquired properties will be<br />
<br />
graded, seeded and landscaped in<br />
preparation for the second phase of<br />
development. Phase two will include<br />
shoreline stablilization, a multi-purpose<br />
field, wetlands, and public shoreline<br />
access piers at the west end of the<br />
park. The master plan calls for boating<br />
and fishing piers, picnicking and park-<br />
ing facilities, expansion of the existing<br />
boat launching ramp, a shoreline walk<br />
and extesive landscaping to be devel-<br />
oped at the east end of the park (near<br />
the Hanover Street Bridge).<br />
<br />
*Pier and Scenic Overlook - With the<br />
<br />
new Waterview Avenue interchange at<br />
Hanover and Potee Streets completed,<br />
the old shoreline segment of Water-<br />
view Avenue could be partially<br />
removed and used for parking for a<br />
scenic overlook as well as for a pier<br />
that could be developed at the site.<br />
This area could also be connected to<br />
other sections of the park by a<br />
pathway.<br />

*Southshore Marinas - It has been esti-<br /><br />
mated that the Middle Branch could<br />
support over 1,200 boat slips by the<br />
1990s. This will be a dramatic increase<br />
from the approximately 350 slips now<br />
available. As the demand for boat<br />
docking space in the harbor grows<br />
beyond the capacity of existing mari-<br />
nas, a portion of the open space along<br />
the Waterview Avenue shoreline will<br />
become a prime location for marinas,<br /><br />
related commercial development, park-<br /><br />
ing and other water-oriented facilities.<br />
It is also expected that existing private<br />
marinas will expand their service and<br />
number of slips as the future demand<br />
grows.<br /><br />
*Waterview Industrial Center - As indi-<br /><br />
cated above, the Waterview Industrial<br />
Center is a major industrial develop-<br />
ment and redevelopment project<br />
which encompasses 22 existing busi-<br />
nesses and 40 acres of vacant land. The<br />
long-range development plan includes<br />
several public improvements and an<br />
expanded urban renewal ordinance to<br />
promote business expansiors and new<br />
industrial development on the area’s<br />
vacant land. It is expected that over $8<br />
million of private investment and 600<br />
new jobs will be generated by develop-<br />
ment activity in the center at the com-<br />
pletion of the project.<br /><br />
*Carr Lowery - There will be an oppor-<br /><br />
tunity for the Carr Lowery glass manu-<br />
facturing plant to build an additional<br />
furnance adjacent to its current site.<br /><br />
*Water Resources Environmental Center<br /><br />
- As part of the Chesapeake Bay Initia-<br />
tives the State’s Department of Natural<br />
Resources has agreed to fund an<br />
environmental center. The center will<br />
be built on the second level of the<br />
new Baltimore Rowing Club facility<br />
and share meeting space. The center<br />
will provide labs and meeting rooms<br />
for area conservation groups;and spe-<br />
cial educational programs.<br /><br />
*Baltimore Rowing Club - The Balti-<br /><br />
more Rowing Club, with support of<br />
the City will develop a club house and<br />
storage facility. With this quality facility<br />
available the rowing club expects to<br />
generate interest in rowing with<br />
colleges, city schools and expand its<br />
membership.<br /><br />
*Trail System - The Middle Branch Park<br /><br />
Plan called for the creation of a con-<br /><br />
tinuous pedestrian/bike trail that<br />
would link the various segments of the<br /><br />
park together and connect the park<br />
itself to the Inner Harbor, Gwynn Falls<br />
Park, and the 9,000-acre Patapsco State<br />
Park.<br /><br />
Rowing returns to the Middle Branch<br /><br />
*Wetland and Wildlife Habitat Devel-<br /><br />
opment and Interpretation - To com-<br />
pensate for the 136 acres of water<br />
habitat taken by the Canton/Seagirt<br />
dredge spoil disposal site for the 1-95<br />
Fort McHenry Tunnel, the Interstate<br />
Division of Baltimore City is exploring<br />
the feasibility of developing wetlands<br />
in the northern Middle Branch. There<br />
are already signs that this area of<br />
degraded water quality is improving.<br />
Wetland vegetation has reestablished<br />
on several small islands and waterfowl<br />
use the areas. If feasible, an expanded<br />
wetland area could itself help improve<br />
water quality by filtering out some pol-<br />
lutants and providing additional wild-<br />
life habitat.<br /><br />
On the east side of the Reedbird Park,<br />
north and south of the Hanover/Potee<br />
Street bridges, existing wetlands will be<br />
improved and expanded. A program of<br />
wetland and water-life interpretation is<br />
envisioned for the area to instruct park<br />
visitors of the importance of a healthly<br />
environment and improving the har-<br />
bor’s water quality. With the improved<br />
habitat and the connections into the<br />
state park system the Middle Branch<br />
Park will offer a unique opportunity<br />
for environmental groups and the<br />
general public to witness the functions<br />
of the complex ecology of this area.<br /><br /><br /><br />
The Department of Planning is explor-<br />
ing additional wildlife related uses for the<br />
park including fish and wild fowl hatcher-<br />
ies. These would provide a much needed<br />
natural resource and a unique educational<br />
opportunity for City residents.<br /><br />
When completed the Middle Branch<br />
Park will be the largest shorefront park in<br />
the entire harbor. The completed park<br />
system, consisting of the Gwynns Falls,<br />
Middle Branch, Southwest and Patapsco<br />
Valley Parks, will offer over 10,000 acres of<br />
recreational facilities, in one of the most<br />
extensive and varied parks in the country,<br />
to this region’s residents.<br /><br />

Industrial Activity: South Baltimore’s<br />
industries are very diverse. Businesses on<br />
the peninsula include a sugar refinery, oil<br />
reprocessing plant, an electric power gen-<br />
erating plant, trucking firms, a pipe and<br />
valve fitting distributor, moving and storage<br />
companies, warehouses, ship repair yards,<br />
as well as manufacturers of soaps and<br />
detergents, electrical insulators and enclo-<br />
sures, paper, paint, industrial fasteners,<br />
cardboard boxes, molasses, syrup, and<br />
animal feed. The industries are located in<br />
three main areas; along Key Highway, in<br />
Locust Point on the peninsula, and in the<br />
southwest section of the peninsula near<br />
Wells Street.<br /><br />
South Baltimore’s four largest indus-<br />
tries are:<br /><br />
*Bethlehem Steel Company’s Key<br />
Highway Shipyard - This major ship<br />
repair yard, which at one time<br />
employed almost 2,000 persons, was<br />
sold in 1984 to private developers. The<br />
City, community and developer have<br />
started a planning process for the<br />
redevelopment of the yard.<br /><br />
*Amstar - This sugar refinery on Key<br />
Highway employs 700 persons. Raw<br />
sugar is brought in by ship, processed<br />
to remove color and impurities, and<br />
then distributed both by truck and<br />
ship. The plant refines approximately<br />
1.2 billion pounds of raw sugar a year<br />
and produces packaged sugar,<br />
molasses for use in animal feed, and<br />
bulk sugar for use in the production of<br />
other food products. Amstar receives<br />
the majority of its raw sugar and fuel<br />
oil by water with over 130 ships<br />
unloading at their docks each year.<br /><br />
*Procter and Gamble - The Baltimore<br />
plant employs 500 people in the manu-<br />
facture of soaps, detergents, and fabric<br />
softeners under such brand names as<br />
lvory, Tide, and Downey. Except for<br />
specialty items like coconut oil which<br />
are delivered by ship, the plant<br />
receives most of its raw materials by<br />
truck and rail and distributes its fin-<br />
ished products by truck.<br /><br />
*Locke Insulator - One of the few<br />
manufacturers of electrical insulators in<br />
the country, this company employs<br />
approximately 500 persons at its plant<br />
off Hanover Street. Its products include<br />
insulators for telephone poles and high<br />
tension transmission lines.<br /><br />
Port Activity: There are three marine<br />
terminals in South Baltimore:<br /><br />
*Locust Point Terminal North - This<br />
terminal, owned by the Maryland Port<br />
Administration and operated by var-<br />
lous companies, contains seven finger<br />
piers which extend out into the water<br />
perpendicular to the mainland. The<br />
piers include seven berths designed for<br />
general cargo and four for bulk cargo.<br />
There are 400,000 square feet of<br />
covered storage, 30 acres of open stor-<br />
age, and rail holding yards for 2,700<br />
cars. Two 75-ton, electric gantry cranes<br />
are located on Pier 4. The channel<br />
serving the terminal ranges in depth<br />
from 30 to 34 feet. Among the com-<br />
panies which utilize the piers of the<br />
north terminal is the Indiana Grain<br />
Cooperative, a grain export company<br />
that recently modernized its entire<br />
handling system to increase its storage<br />
capacity to 13-million bushels with a<br />
loading capability of 125,000 bushels<br />
per hour. Three latex import opera-<br />
tions are also located at the north ter-<br />
minal: Uniroyal, Firestone, and Good-<br />
year. The three facilities make the Port<br />
of Baltimore the largest latex import<br />
center in the United States. Latex is<br />
used to manufacture a variety of pro-<br />
ducts including tubing, glues, carpet<br />
backing and medical equipment.<br /><br />
*Locust Point Terminal South - At this<br />
terminal ships berth parallel to the<br />
mainland and are loaded or unloaded<br />
by one of four cranes, including the<br />
port’s only heavy-lift, 350-ton crane,<br />
known as the “Baltimore 350.” The<br />
marginal pier configuration where<br />
ships dock right along side the main-<br />
land is particularly efficient for<br />
handling containers which are this<br />
terminal’s major cargo. Owned by the<br />
Maryland Port Administration and<br />
operated by Atlantic and Gulf Steve-<br />
dores, Inc., the southside terminal<br />
includes 120,000 square feet of covered<br />
storage and 23 acres of open storage.<br />
The channel serving this terminal is 36<br />
feet deep.<br /><br />
*Port Covington Terminal - Located in<br />
the southwestern section of South<br />
Baltimore east of Hanover Street and<br />
owned by the CSX Railroad, the Port<br />
Covington marine terminal contains<br />
190 acres separated into two sections<br />
by the Baltimore Gas and Electric Co.’s<br />
Gould Street Station. The 130-acre<br />
western section of the facility includes<br />
an ore pier, a vacant covered pier, and<br />
a nonfunctioning coal pier. South of<br />
the three piers the Louis Dreyfus Co.<br /><br />
operates a 23-acre grain export termi-<br />
nal. Between the Dreyfus facility and<br />
Locke Insulator Company is a 50 acre<br />
parcel which contains the vacant<br />
Lehigh Cement Company building, an<br />
abandoned repair shed, and underutil-<br />
ized railroad tracks.<br /><br />
Transportation: The CSX Railroad<br />
through its Baltimore and Ohio Railroad<br />
and Western Maryland Railway division<br />
serves South Baltimore industries. Its exten-<br />
sive system of tracks date back over 100<br />
years when the railroads first established<br />
major port facilities in Locust Point.<br /><br />
Highway access to South Baltimore is<br />
provided by an interchange with south-<br />
bound Interstate 95 and via Route 2,<br />
Hanover Street and a full interchange at<br />
McComas Street and Key Highway. Three<br />
local streets serve as major arteries: Key<br />
Highway, Fort Avenue, and McComas<br />
Street. '<br /><br />
Residential Areas: The Locust Point<br />
peninsula supports three communities,<br />
South Baltimore and Federal Hill which<br />
extend from the Inner Harbor south to<br />
Interstate-95 , and the Locust Point neigh-<br />
borhood which is clustered on both sides<br />
of Fort Avenue east of Key Highway. South<br />
Baltimore and Locust Point are primarily<br />
working class communities with many of<br />
the residents owning their homes especially<br />
in the Locust Point neighborhood. While<br />
the industries of the area have provided<br />
stable employment for many of the resi-<br />
dents the communities are also directly<br />
impacted by the operations of the termi-<br />
nals, railyards and manufacturing plants.<br />
Heavy truck traffic, noise, vibrations and air<br />
pollution are all concerns which have been<br />
expressed by members of the communities.<br /><br />
Recreation Areas: The South Baltimore<br />
peninsula contains five parks. Fort<br />
McHenry, a national historic park on the<br />
eastern tip of the peninsula, attracts over<br />
700,000 visitors a year, most arriving by car.<br />
Federal Hill Park affords a dramatic vantage<br />
of both the Inner Harbor and the Key<br />
Highway Shipyard. Latrobe Park in Locust<br />
Point and Riverside Park and Swann Park in<br />
South Baltimore offer recreation facilities<br />
for neighborhood residents.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Planned Development<br /><br />
Private: The Locke Insulator Co. gained<br />
approval in 1982 to fill 1.5 acres of shore-<br />
line to expand its plant. The added land<br />
will allow the company to remain at its cur-<br />
rent site and add approximately 100 new<br />
jobs. To compensate for its expansion into<br />
existing water area, the company has<br />
created a new wetland of comparable size<br />
at Reedbird Park further south on the<br />
Middle Branch.<br /><br />
Public: A great many public improve-<br />
ments are programmed for the South<br />
Baltimore peninsula, most of them in con-<br />
junction with the construction of the Inter-<br />
state 95 expressway.<br /><br /><br /><br />
*Interstate 95 - The completion of this<br />
1-1/2-mile segment of roadway, which<br />
will connect the existing Hanover<br />
Street interchange to the roadway in<br />
Canton and will include the eight-lane,<br />
Fort McHenry Tunnel, represents the<br />
final link in an expressway connecting<br />
Baltimore’s harbor to the entire east<br />
coast. This final segment costing over<br />
$800 million will be completed in two<br />
phases. In December 1982 the roadway<br />
was opened from Hanover Street to<br />
Key Highway, and by 1985 from Key<br />
Highway across the harbor to Canton.<br />
Coupled with the highway construc-<br />
tion there have been improvements to<br />
McComas Street and the installation of<br />
noise barriers and earth mounds to<br />
shield the Francis Scott Key Public<br />
School and Latrobe Park from highway<br />
noise.<br /><br />
*B &amp; O Riverside Yard - The locomotive<br />
service and maintenance center for all<br />
B &amp; O operations in Baltimore has been<br />
relocated for the construction of Inter-<br />
state 95. As a result the B&amp; O has built<br />
a new maintenance shop, oil storage<br />
tank, and internal service road.<br /><br />
*Locust Point North Marine Terminal -<br />
The Maryland Port Administration has<br />
scheduled improvements to several<br />
piers at its north terminal. In the next<br />
few years, a wooden pier will be<br />
replaced with a steel and concrete<br />
structure, an old shed will be demo-<br />
lished, and existing piers will be paved<br />
and lighting installed.<br /><br />
*Hull Street Park - Though close to the<br />
water, the Locust Point community has<br />
no direct public access to the harbor.<br />
Most of the shoreline is devoted to<br /><br />
“industrial, port, and rail activities. To<br />
give the community an opportunity to<br /><br />
enjoy the shoreline, the City converted<br /><br />
the northern end of Hull Street into a<br />
small park with a pier for docking<br />
boats and for fishing. The project was<br />
completed in 1984.<br /><br />
Construction of the Fort McHenry Tunnel<br /><br /><br /><br />
*Southern High School Playfield - Con-<br />
structed in mid-1983 on land just to<br />
the east of the school the playfield will<br />
provide a football practice field and a<br />
track and field area.<br /><br />

water area of the harbor by filling in<br />
the shoreline at the Canton-Seagirt site<br />
with spoil from the Fort McHenry<br />
Tunnel dredging, a 5.3-acre, land-<br />
scaped wetland area will be created in<br />

|ssues and Problems<br /><br />
Port-Related Issues: Two concerns face<br />
the Maryland Port Administration’s cargo<br />
handling operations at the North and South<br />
Locust Point Terminals. First, there is<br />
insufficient storage space for incoming and<br />
outgoing cargo. As a consequence, export<br />
cargo must be held in other parts of the<br />
City and then hauled to the terminal when<br />
the appropriate ship arrives. This is both<br />
costly and inefficient. Import cargo must be<br />
immediately loaded onto trucks and rail<br />
cars, creating scheduling difficulties. The<br />
scarcity of available storage space limits the<br />
number of ships the Locust Point terminals<br />
are able to handle.<br /><br />
A second concern which faces the<br />
South Locust Point Terminal and adjoining<br />
industries is the possible adverse effect of<br />
the new expressway on the available “stack-<br />
ing”’ and manuevering space for trucks. A<br />
busy marine terminal requires considerable<br />
space where trucks waiting to load or<br />
unload cargo can line up. The Interstate<br />
Division of Baltimore City, the Port Admin-<br />
istration, and local industries have worked<br />
to accommodate these concerns and allow<br />
for the construction of Interstate-95 and<br /><br />
the Fort McHenry Tunnel. Actual operation<br />
of the terminal with the completed high-<br />
way will test these solutions.<br /><br />
While not as critical to South Balti-<br />
more’s port activities as to port activities<br />
elsewhere on the harbor, dredging the<br />
harbor’s main channel from its current<br />
depth of 42 feet to a new depth of 50 feet<br />
might benefit the grain operation on Pier 7<br />
at the Locust Point North Terminal.<br /><br />
Traffic and Parking Problems: The resi-<br />
dential communities of South Baltimore<br />
and Locust Point have long faced the<br />
annoying problem of truck traffic on local<br />
residential streets. This problem should be<br />
somewhat reduced by the new internal<br />
road linking North and South Locust Point<br />
Marine Terminals constructed by the Port<br />
Administration.<br /><br />
Environmental Issues: The most signifi-<br />
cant environmental issue in the South<br />
Baltimore area is air pollution. Like all the<br />
heavily industrialized areas around the<br />
port, South Baltimore has been classified by<br />
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency<br />
as a “‘non-attainment area” for airborne<br />
particles. These particles, or suspended par-<br /><br />
ticulates, are very fine and are released into<br /><br />
the air by industrial processes, vehicle<br />
exhausts, construction and demolition activ-<br />
ities, vacant, unkept land, loading, unload-<br />
ing, and storage of dry bulk goods. Inhal-<br />
ing these particles, especially over a long<br />
period of time, can lead to severe respira-<br />
tory problems and damage to the lungs.<br />
The problem should be significantly<br />
reduced once,the extensive construction<br />
work is completed on Interstate 95 in 1985.<br />
However, full and effective control of the<br />
problem will also require technological<br />
innovations making it economically practi-<br />
cal to control the particulate pollution pro-<br />
duced by grain and other bulk material<br />
transfer operations and the many acres of<br />
railyards in Locust Point.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Planned Development<br />
<br />
Private: The Locke Insulator Co. gained<br />
approval in 1982 to fill 1.5 acres of shore-<br />
line to expand its plant. The added land<br />
will allow the company to remain at its cur-<br />
rent site and add approximately 100 new<br />
jobs. To compensate for its expansion into<br />
existing water area, the company has<br />
created a new wetland of comparable size<br />
at Reedbird Park further south on the<br />
Middle Branch.<br />
<br />
Public: A great many public improve-<br />
ments are programmed for the South<br />
Baltimore peninsula, most of them in con-<br />
junction with the construction of the Inter-<br />
state 95 expressway.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
*Interstate 95 - The completion of this<br />
1-1/2-mile segment of roadway, which<br />
will connect the existing Hanover<br />
Street interchange to the roadway in<br />
Canton and will include the eight-lane,<br />
Fort McHenry Tunnel, represents the<br />
final link in an expressway connecting<br />
Baltimore’s harbor to the entire east<br />
coast. This final segment costing over<br />
$800 million will be completed in two<br />
phases. In December 1982 the roadway<br />
was opened from Hanover Street to<br />
Key Highway, and by 1985 from Key<br />
Highway across the harbor to Canton.<br />
Coupled with the highway construc-<br />
tion there have been improvements to<br />
McComas Street and the installation of<br />
noise barriers and earth mounds to<br />
shield the Francis Scott Key Public<br />
School and Latrobe Park from highway<br />
noise.<br />
<br />
*B & O Riverside Yard - The locomotive<br />
service and maintenance center for all<br />
B & O operations in Baltimore has been<br />
relocated for the construction of Inter-<br />
state 95. As a result the B& O has built<br />
a new maintenance shop, oil storage<br />
tank, and internal service road.<br />
<br />
*Locust Point North Marine Terminal -<br />
The Maryland Port Administration has<br />
scheduled improvements to several<br />
piers at its north terminal. In the next<br />
few years, a wooden pier will be<br />
replaced with a steel and concrete<br />
structure, an old shed will be demo-<br />
lished, and existing piers will be paved<br />
and lighting installed.<br />
<br />
*Hull Street Park - Though close to the<br />
water, the Locust Point community has<br />
no direct public access to the harbor.<br />
Most of the shoreline is devoted to<br />
<br />
“industrial, port, and rail activities. To<br />
give the community an opportunity to<br />
<br />
enjoy the shoreline, the City converted<br />
<br />
the northern end of Hull Street into a<br />
small park with a pier for docking<br />
boats and for fishing. The project was<br />
completed in 1984.<br />
<br />
Construction of the Fort McHenry Tunnel<br />

 <br />
<br />
*Southern High School Playfield - Con-<br />

the east of the school the playfield will<br />
provide a football practice field and a<br />
track and field area.<br />

uture Opportunities<br /><br /><br /><br />
There are several significant develop-<br />
ment opportunities in South Baltimore.<br /><br />
Port Covington: With the exception of<br />
the Dreyfus Grain operation and the Balti-<br />
more Gas and Electric Co.’s Gould Station,<br />
much of the 190-acre Port Covington com-<br />
plex is either vacant or underutilized. Its<br /><br />
~owner, the CSX Railroad, has expressed<br /><br />
interest in the long-term redevelopment<br />
potential of this major waterfront parcel.<br />
Four alternatives have been developed for<br />
discussion purposes. All proposals assume<br />
that the eastern portion of the site, approx-<br />
imately 60 acres, would remain as a site for<br />
expansion of the harbor-related activities.<br /><br />
1) Industrial Park - Dreyfus Grain Termi-<br />
nal would remain. The area would be<br />
developed for industrial sites.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Foreign Trade Zone, Industrial Park 3)<br />
and Regional Shopping Center - Drey-<br /><br />
fus Grain is relocated. The waterfront is<br />
developed as a specialized Foreign<br /><br />
Trade Zone using existing ship chan-<br /><br />
nels and piers. Inland area is devel-<br /><br />
oped as an industrial park. The western<br /><br />
-portion of the property is used for a<br /><br />
regional mall geared to capture the<br /><br />
south and southwest Baltimore City,<br />
Baltimore and Anne Arundel County 4)<br />
markets. Mall is oriented to the water-<br /><br />
front with a large marina, nautical<br /><br />
shopping complex, and public shore-<br /><br />
line promenade.<br /><br />
Stadium/Hotel/Marina and Sports<br />
Complex - The majority of the site is<br />
developed for a new regional stadium.<br />
Parking is entirely on grade with direct<br />
access to and from Interstate-95 and<br />
Hanover Street. The waterfront would<br />
be developed with a hotel and sports<br />
complex, a major marina, nautical<br />
shoppiftg center, and public shoreline<br />
promenade.<br /><br />
Major Manufacturing Facility - The<br />
entire site becomes the location of a<br />
major water and rail oriented manufac-<br />
turer. This could include plants for<br />
auto assembly, steel fabrication, etc.<br />
This could provide employment for<br />
over 1,700 people if developed at 12<br />
people per acre.<br /><br /><br /><br />

velopment History<br /><br /><br /><br />
The Beginning<br /><br />
Baltimoreans picked up the July 16,<br />
1956 edition of The Evening Sun to find<br />
bannered across the front page Planning<br />
Director Arthur McVoy’s Prospectus for<br />
Downtown Baltimore which promised to<br />
make it “one of the most exciting cities in<br />
the world.” The newspaper story like the<br />
document itself was deliberately vague,<br />
futuristic—and visionary.<br /><br />
To a city such as Baltimore, talk like<br />
McVoy’s was at variance with the reality of<br />
the day. Baltimore had developed, as one<br />
article put it, a sizable inferiority complex.<br />
There were overcrowded and deteriorated<br />
neighborhoods; the downtown was losing<br />
its focus as the retail center; and many city<br />
blocks around the harbor were occupied<br />
with vacant warehouses.<br /><br />
“It was perceived as a city with a great<br />
past and no future, and if you made it you<br />
were moving to New York or Philadelphia<br />
or Chicago,” an American Institute of<br />
Architects account recalled. There was a<br />
thin middle class, little support for cultural<br />
activity, few good restaurants.<br /><br />
Baltimore in the 1950s, in short, was on<br />
a downward spiral, like many older cities in<br />
the Northwest. And if an outward, visible<br />
sign of the city’s poor condition was<br /><br />
needed, the Inner Harbor waterfront pro-<br />
vided it. “<br /><br />
By the 1950’s, most commercial ships<br />
had moved elsewhere and the Bay steamers<br />
had disappeared altogether from their Light<br />
Street docks. In the description of one<br />
observer, much of the Inner Harbor had<br />
the look of Dresden after the war. Much of<br />
the area held only derelict warehouses.<br />
Abandoned cars were found along deserted<br />
streets which during the evening were<br />
populated by toothless winos and rats.<br /><br />
So, the new vision for downtown Balti-<br />
more naturally met with skepticism. How-<br />
ever, the suggestions were not ignored by<br />
all. When Planning Director McVoy wrote<br />
of “water oriented cities such as Stock-<br />
holm, Rio de Janeiro, Venice and Copen-<br />
hagen,” there were some in Baltimore who<br />
shared his aspirations, first in the down-<br />
town business community, later in the city<br />
government.<br /><br />
Catalyst for Action<br /><br />
The triggering event by most accounts<br />
for what has followed took place in late<br />
1954, when O’Neill’s Department store, one<br />
of the city’s biggest, closed. This jolt came<br />
on the heels of years of declining retail<br />
sales downtown. At the time, only one<br />
major new office building had been con-<br />
structed in mid-Baltimore in 25 years; six<br />
major employers had moved out of down-<br />
town; property assessments were falling in<br />
the area; and the vacancy rates were as<br /><br />
high as 25 percent in some downtown<br />
blocks.<br /><br />
With the O’Neill’s closing, J. Jefferson<br />
Miller, executive vice president of The<br /><br />
80<br /><br />
Hecht Co., took action. Miller is credited<br />
with persuading the Retail Merchants Asso-<br />
ciation, of which he was a director, to look<br />
into what other cities were doing to cope<br />
with similar problems. The quick conclu-<br />
sion was that the merchants by themselves<br />
could not bring about a turnaround. In<br />
1954 they formed a Committee for Down-<br />
town and recruited members from utilities,<br />
banks and other property owners.<br /><br />
A<br /><br />
At about the same time another new<br />
business/civic group, the Greater Baltimore<br />
Committee, composed of 100 top execu-<br />
tives of the metropolitan area was formed.<br />
Both the Committee for Downtown and<br />
the Greater Baltimore Committee agreed<br />
that downtown renewal had to be a top<br />
priority. In 1956, the Greater Baltimore<br />
Committee created a wholly owned subsi-<br />
diary, the Planning Council, to address<br />
redevelopment issues. The Planning Coun-<br />
cil was funded in April, 1957, through<br />
efforts of the Committee for Downtown<br />
and the Greater Baltimore Committee,<br />
each contributing $150,000 and $75,000,<br />
respectively, to prepare a comprehensive<br />
study and plan for action for downtown.<br />
The Planning Council’s team was headed<br />
by David Wallace, a nationally known<br />
planner and architect.<br /><br />
The team’s first effort was an overall<br />
look at about 220 acres at the center of Bal-<br />
timore’s downtown. “We soon realized that<br />
unless something drastic was done in the<br />
form of an immediate project, we would<br />
lose our investors. Charles Center was a<br />
response to the need for some action,”<br />
Wallace has recalled. '<br /><br /><br />","Baltimore’s Inner Basin, late 19th century<br />

The Charles Center Project<br /><br />
The Wallace team proposed a single,<br />
dramatic project that would reverse the<br />
downslide. The proposal for the 33 acre<br />
Charles Center project, located north and<br />
west of the Inner Harbor, between the<br />
retail and financial districts, was completed<br />
in 1958 and presented to Mayor Thomas J.<br />
D’Alesandro, Jr. The plan was received with<br />
enthusiasm and turned over to the Balti-<br />
more Urban Renewal and Housing agency<br />
for detailed review and a feasibility study.<br />
In March, 1959, the City Council adopted<br />
Charles Center as an official urban renewal<br />
plan.<br /><br />
The Charles Center plan’s adoption in<br />
1959 effectively made the city government<br />
and the downtown business community<br />
partners, with a shared objective. This part-<br />
nership was formalized in 1959 with the<br />
establishment of the Charles Center Man-<br />
agement Office, led by ). Jefferson Miller,<br />
to implement the project under a personal<br />
contract with the city. The creation of this<br />
office was a major factor in the speed with<br />
which private developers were persuaded<br />
to invest in the project. Through this man-<br />
agement office the City could combine the<br />
flexibility of a private corporation with the<br />
city’s powers to raise working capital and<br />
assemble land through emminent domain.<br /><br />

Construction was well underway at<br />
Charles Center when Mayor Theodore R.<br />
McKeldin, Jr., sounded the charge for Balti-<br />
more to take its next big step forward: re-<br />
claiming the Inner Harbor. In his inaugural<br />
address on May 21, 1963, McKeldin talked<br />
of an “enthralling panorama of office build-<br />
ings, parks, high-rise apartments, and mari-<br />
nas’’ around the old harbor. He urged that<br />
a plan be developed for the area, consist-<br />
ing of 240 acres including the financial and<br />
municipal districts, adjacent to the still-<br />
developing Charles Center Project.<br /><br />
At the time of Mayor McKeldin’s call,<br />
the Inner Harbor had already been partially<br />
cleaned up. Beginning in 1950 under<br />
Mayor D’Alesandro, Jr., the piers and<br />
decayed structures at the west end of the<br />
Inner Harbor along Light Street had been<br /><br />
‘removed.<br /><br />
The Planning Council was again com-<br />
missioned to prepare a proposal and David<br />
Wallace’s firm, Wallace-McHarg of Phila-<br />
delphia, was hired. Funding for this step<br />
was an arrangement involving three<br />
groups, with $35,000 provided by the city<br />
and $25,000 each from the Greater Balti-<br />
more Committee and Committee for<br />
Downtown. This three member partnership<br />
was an important step in Baltimore’s move<br />
toward increased government initiative in<br />
the redevelopment process.<br /><br />

of green space at the intersection of Light<br />
and Pratt Streets, known as Sam Smith Park.<br />
The widened roadway had been built on<br />
fill at the western edge of the harbor<br />
where the steamships had once docked.<br />
The transformation had begun. However,<br />
the western edge of the water was given<br />
over entirely to vehicles, and the obsolete<br />
structures which remained at the north and<br />
south sides of the harbor, many in poor<br />
condition, still constituted a barrier to pub-<br />
lic use of the area. There were no provi-<br />
sions for access to the shoreline and no<br />
attractions to draw people to the still pol-<br />
luted water’s edge.<br /><br />
The 1964 plan called for a 30-year, $260-<br />
million effort along the harbor’s edge and<br />
in the adjacent financial and municipal dis-<br />
tricts. Over 700 pieces of property were<br />
involved. The city was fortunate to already<br />
own the key, 18-acre waterfront along Pratt<br />
and Light Streets which was purchased after<br />
the 1904 fire and expanded by fill in the<br />
early 1950’s.<br /><br />

redevelopment of the Inner Harbor, less<br />
than 10 years after the first concerted action<br />
had been taken in Charles Center to re-<br />
verse downtown Baltimore’s decline.<br /><br />
Another aspect of the 1964 plan is<br />
worth noting. It called for opening the<br />

seems a natural recommendation to us<br />
today, it should be remembered that in<br />
1964 waterfronts were usually ignored and<br />
were often proposed for highways. As late<br />
as 1968, there were still plans for a super-<br />

The Inner Harbor Project<br /><br />
A project of the dimension of the<br />
renewal of the Inner Harbor had to be<br />
phased. Three areas, labeled simply Inner<br />
Harbor Project | (the first phase of 95 acres<br />
next to the water), Inner Harbor West, and<br />
Inner Harbor East were created to imple-<br />
ment the City’s plans.<br /><br />
By 1965 there was recognition that a<br />
specialized management entity was needed<br />
to implement the Inner Harbor program.<br />
The Charles Center Management Office<br />
was transformed into Charles Center-Inner<br />
Harbor Management Inc., a nopeprofit<br />
corporation with ). Jefferson Miller as<br />
chairman. Martin Millspaugh, a Baltimorean<br />
who had been Assistant Commissioner of<br />
the U.S. Urban Renewal Administration and<br />
Deputy General Manager of Charles Cen-<br />

Jr., a prominent businessman and former<br />
chairman of the Baltimore Urban Renewal<br />
and Housing Commission, joined the CC/<br />
IH Corp. as Vice-Chairman in 1970. After<br />
Mr. Miller’s death in 1972, Mr. Sondheim<br />
became chairman and Mr. Millspaugh<br />
became President and Chief Executive.<br /><br />
Action came fairly fast— just two years<br />
after Mayor MKeldin launched the Inner<br />
Harbor renewal area. Plans for the Inner<br />
Harbor Project | area were made public<br />
and designated as the first target; voters<br />
approved a $12,000,000 loan for the Inner<br />
Harbor in 1966, and the Urban Renewal<br />
Plan was approved by the Mayor and City<br />
Council in June of 1967.<br /><br />

funding that had begun in Charles Center.<br />
In 1968 a $22.4 Federal Grant was released<br />
for Inner Harbor Project I. These funds<br />
coupled with the voter approved bond<br />
money, meant that Baltimore could pro-<br />
ceed in earnest with land purchases and<br />
clearance of the old warehouses and other<br />
run down structures.<br /><br />
Although few Baltimoreans were aware<br />
of it at the time, the City had begun the<br />
process of reclaiming the waterfront for<br />
public use. Initial work involved bulkhead-<br />

visit to the harbor, this would spread to<br />
other parts of downtown and eventually<br />
the entire city.<br /><br />
In 1972, Pier | along the northern<br />
shoreline was rebuilt for the U.S.F. Constel-<br />
lation, built in 1797 and the oldest ship in<br />
the U.S. Navy. The first of the Inner Har-<br />
bor’s public attractions was in place.<br /><br />
In 1973, the city shifted the City Fair to<br />
the Inner Harbor. This event, begun in 1969<br />
to celebrate the City’s neighborhoods, is a<br />
deliberate effort on the part of Baltimore to<br />
create good feelings about the city. The fair<br />
has grown into an immense, enthusiastic<br />
September spectacle; an estimated two<br />
million persons attended the weekend<br />
event in 1983. Part of the resistance that<br />
later developed to plans for some of the<br />
buildings along the edge of the Inner Har-<br />
bor stemmed in part from the public’s fear<br />
that the City Fair would be displaced as<br />
Pratt and Light Streets were developed with<br />
major new buildings. The fair was relocated<br />
in 1981 to Marketplace, the Pratt Street<br />
Boulevard, and Piers 5 and 6.<br /><br />
Another milestone occurred in 1972,<br />
completion of the first building in the<br />
Inner Harbor area, Christ Lutheran’s Harbor<br />
Apartments south of the McCormick spice<br />
factory. In 1973, one of Baltimore’s tallest<br />
buildings, the U.S.F. &amp; G. home office was<br />
completed.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Light St., Harborplace, 1983<br /><br />
As the country observed its bicentenial<br />
in 1976, Baltimore took advantage of one of<br />
the most spectacular events created for the<br />
celebration, the Tall Ships. A special com-<br />
mittee of city residents and local corpora-<br />
tions worked to attract a major visit of this<br />
fleet of the world’s sailing ships. A two<br />
week long celebration was planned. More<br />
tall ships visited Baltimore than any other<br />

port. The area’s residents were caught up<br />
in the excitement and welcomed the crews<br />
and visitors with the kind of fervor unheard<br />
of since Baltimore greeted Lafayette on his<br />
triumphant tour 150 years earlier. Over two<br />
and a half million visitors, many from the<br />
Midwest and adjoining states, poured into<br />
the city. The event also drew visitors from<br />
the Washington and Baltimore suburbs and<br />
introduced them to a newly emerging<br />
Inner Harbor.<br /><br />
By 1976 there was enough physical<br />
evidence of the downtown/harbor transfor-<br />
mation to come to make it attractive. The<br />
number of buildings either underway or<br />
occupied grew each year. The IBM office<br />
building near Pratt and Light Streets, was<br />
finished in 1975. The Maryland Science<br />
Center designed by architect Edward Durell<br />
Stone at the harbor’s southwestern edge<br />
was opened in 1976, and playing fields<br />
were completed at the south side of the<br />
harbor. 1976 also saw the dedication of the<br />
Harbor Campus of the Community College<br />
of Baltimore. The C &amp; P Telephone Co.<br />
completed its building at Pratt and con-<br />
struction was underway on the World<br />
Trade Center, the harbor’s dominant struc-<br />
ture, which opened in 1977.<br /><br />
Beyond the one-time spectacle of<br />
the Tall ships, the Inner Harbor area was<br />
(and is) used all summer by city-spon-<br />
sored, weekend ethnic festivals and other<br />
activities. The green open space behind the<br />
shoreline promenade became the city’s<br />
front yard, the place to gather, celebrate,<br />
and enjoy city life.<br /><br />
After the success of the Tall Ships visit,<br />
the future of the Inner Harbor as a gather-<br />
ing place fer the region’s citizens was<br />
sealed. What wasn’t settled yet was the final<br />
nature of that place and how people<br />
wanted to see it used.<br /><br />
The Charles Center and Inner Harbor<br />
projects were nearly uninterrupted success<br />
stories to this point. Nothing as complex<br />
and innovative as these undertakings would<br />
be without some difficulties.<br /><br />
An illustration of the latter occurred in<br />
1977 when Baltimore was negotiating to<br />
bring a hotgl to the Inner Harbor. A major<br />
new hotel was needed to make the city’s<br />
planned Convention Center (opened in<br />
1979) attractive to conventions. But the<br />
drawing power of the Inner Harbor was<br />
still not clear to investors in 1977. As Mayor<br />
Schaefer has recalled “We were practically<br />
on our knees to get some hotel chain to<br />
make a commitment.” In fact the first two<br />
hotel developers selected were unable to<br />
carry out their plans. In order to make it<br />
possible for the Hyatt chain to build in the<br />
Inner Harbor, Baltimore obtained a $10-<br />
million federal Urban Development Action<br />
Grant which, together with a $2 million set-<br />

xisting Conditions<br /><br />
The many different uses and features<br />
that comprise the network of attractions in<br />
the Inner Harbor today began falling into<br />
place in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<br /><br />
Two major restaurants, apart from<br />
those housed in Harborplace, have located<br />
at the Inner Harbor. The Chart House<br />
opened in 1979 on Pier 4 on the northern<br />
side of the harbor, the first attraction in<br />
that area. Extensive renovation of the old<br />
maintenance shops of the Gas and Electric<br />
Co.’s Power Plant was involved. In 1977,<br />
construction began on the Innef Harbor<br />
marina, the first new major boating facility<br />
to be built in the harbor in years. The<br />
Rusty Scupper opened in 1982 alongside<br />
the city marina on the south edge of the<br />
harbor.<br /><br />
On top of the 30-story World Trade<br />
Center that has become one of the Inner<br />
Harbor’s symbolic structures is The Top of<br />
The World, a public observation deck<br />
opened in 1979. Developed by the Balti-<br />
more Office of Promotion and Fourism, the<br />
observation deck provides the public with<br />
a chance to view the sweep of Baltimore’s<br />
harbor as it spreads from the city center to<br />
the Chesapeake Bay.<br /><br />
Along the western boundary of the<br />
Inner Harbor at Charles Street and Pratt<br />
Street Boulevard are a number of major<br />
buildings completed in the late 1970’s and<br />
early 1980’s. The Baltimore Convention<br />
Center opened in 1979 and provides 115,000<br />
square feet of exhibit and 45,000 square<br />
feet meeting space. Construction was<br />
financed by a $35 million state bond issue<br />
and $10 million in City funds. The Conven-<br />
tion Center tied to the other attractions of<br />
the Inner Harbor, has advanced Baltimore<br />
as a meeting place for many national and<br />
international groups. A major requirement<br />
of the convention market is an adequate<br />
supply of hotel rooms to meet the<br />
demands of the increasing number of vis-<br />
itors. The Hyatt Regency Hotel opened in<br />
1981 with 500 rooms and the potential for<br />
adding 350 more. This luxury hotel is<br />
directly connected to the Convention Cen-<br />
ter and Harborplace by a series of over-<br />
head pedestrian plazas and walkways.<br /><br />
Immediately north of the Convention<br />
Center is the Equitable Center. As the<br />
home office of the Equitable Trust Bank,<br />
the building also contains a shopping mall<br />
and department store branch. A pedestrian<br />
arcade runs through the building, connect-<br />
ing Charles Center with the Convention<br />
Center, the Hyatt, Harborplace and the<br />
promenade.<br /><br />
~In a large triangular piece of land at<br />
the juncture of Light Street and the Pratt<br />
Street Boulevard is the McKeldin Square<br /><br />
and fountain. The fountain is designed to<br />
operate in all but the coldest weather and<br />
replicates waterfalls, pools and rushing<br />
streams. Visitors may walk around and over<br />
the fountain.<br /><br />
The most spectacular singular addition<br />
to the Inner Harbor has been the National<br />
Aquarium in Baltimore, located at the end<br />
of Pier 3.<br /><br />
It’s success is a phenomenon parallel<br />
to that of Harborplace. As the visitor wait-<br />
ing lines attest, the Aquarium has become<br />
a magnet which has exceeded the city’s<br />
original expectations. Instead of a projected<br />
600,000 annual visitors, the facility was<br />
toured by 1.6 million during 1981-82, its<br />
first year. Designed by Peter Chermayeff of<br />
the Cambridge Seven Associates, the aqua-<br />
rium was built by the City of Baltimore for<br />
$21.5 million. The stunning building houses<br />
5,000 specimens of aquatic life and a tropi-<br />
cal rain forest.<br /><br />
As the Inner Harbor project area has<br />
expanded, the City’s attention has been<br />
drawn to the east along the Pratt Street<br />
Boulevard and to Piers 4, 5 and 6 and<br />
across the Jones Falls to Falls Harbor. In<br />
1981 the City erected a concert pavilion on<br />
the end of Pier 6. This large tent structure<br />
can seat over 2000 people under the can-<br />
opy and 400 picnickers outside. Boaters<br />
have room to moor along the side of the<br />
pier. In 1982 canopied pedestrian bridges<br />
linking little Italy and the piers were com-<br />
pleted permitting easy access to harbor<br />
attractions and parking. One of the newest<br />
additions, also completed in 1982, is the<br />
renovated, ornate Eastern Avenue Pumping<br />
Station which houses the Department of<br />
Public Work’s Museum. Adjacent to the<br />
pumping station is a unique sculpture<br />
composed of an above-ground replica of a<br />
street intersection. There, visitors can learn<br />
of the complexities of sewers, gas lines,<br />
storm drains and street construction.<br /><br />
But it is the two Harborplace pavilions,<br />
with their shops, restaurants, and colorful<br />
markets that have captured the public’s<br />
attention. The installation, at a cost of $22<br />
million, has come to be the symbol of the<br />
complete turnaround that has taken place<br />
since 1967 at the Inner Harbor. The indices<br />
of the success of Harborplace are many:<br />
first-year visits totaling 18 million; sales of a<br />
reported $400 per square foot, or more<br />
than twice that in traditional shopping<br />
malls; over 2,000 new jobs; inclusion of the<br />
promised high portion of minority firms<br />
among Harborplace’s 130 shops and restau-<br />
rants, and several millions of dollars paid<br />
each year to the City and State in taxes and<br />
parking revenues.<br /><br />
Now the Inner Harbor promenade,<br />
almost a mile and a half long, functions like<br />
a boardwalk tying together attractions,<br /><br />
businesses and the many special events<br />
along the waterfront.<br /><br /><br /><br />
lssues and Problems<br /><br />
Along with the overwhelming success<br />
of the Inner Harbor there are several issues<br />
to be addressed. Heading the list continue<br />
to be two problems which have confronted<br />
Baltimore for at least 30 years, namely traf-<br />
fic and parking. Pratt and Lombard Streets<br />
along the north side of the Inner Harbor<br />
are two of the city’s major traffic arteries.<br />
Improvements to the existing street system<br /><br />
* and the new 1-95 Fort McHenry harbor<br /><br />
tunnel, will draw off some of the through<br />
traffic, especially heavy trucks, but there is<br />
every likelihood that Pratt, Lombard and<br />
Light Streets will continue to carry heavy<br />
traffic. The City has addressed this problem<br />
through the use of innovative traffic con-<br />
trol devices, traffic police to direct vehicles<br />
and pedestrians at critical intersections dur-<br />
ing peak hours, and by promoting the<br />
development of overhead walkways allow-<br />
ing visitors to reach the harbor without<br />
conflicts with traffic. There is a widespread<br />
public perception that parking is inade-<br />
quate in the Inner Harbor. While there are<br />
over 5,000 spaces open to the public within<br />
several blocks of the promenade, many<br />
people claim that it is difficult to find a<br />
parking place. The actual fact is that at<br />
nearly all times, there are hundreds of<br />
unused parking places within several blocks<br />
of the Harbor. The public is not always<br />
aware of those spaces, however. The City is<br />
addressing this issue by extensive signing of<br />
parking garages and provision of maps<br />
showing where parking is available. In addi-<br />
tion, the City has plans for adding new<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

parking spaces in several locations as<br />
demand increases. Further, the opening of<br />
the first leg of the Baltimore subway should<br />
improve access to the area and alleviate<br />
some of the parking demand.<br /><br />
Adjacent residential communities of<br />
Little Italy, Federal Hill, and Otterbein are<br />
concerned about the impact on their neigh-<br />
borhoods of heavily attended Inner Harbor<br />
events. The City has developed residential<br />
permit parking programs to limit the park-<br />
ing impact and continues to work with the<br />
neighborhoods to help them maintain their<br />
residential atmosphere.<br /><br />
Finally, boating safety has become a<br />
growing concern as more and more boat-<br />
ers use the Inner Harbor for recreational<br />
boating. As recreational boats are drawn to<br />
the Inner Harbor’s basin they must navigate<br />
through the country’s fourth most active<br />
port. In the basin itself, a relatively small<br />
water body, tourist boats, pleasure craft,<br />
visiting ships, and paddle boats must com-<br />
pete for limited space and right-of-way.<br />
The Mayor’s Task Force on Boating Safety<br />
was appointed in 1981 to develop ways of<br />
dealing with potential conflicts. Added<br />
police authority to deal with boating infrac-<br />
tions has been implemented as a first step,<br />
and the Task Force continues to address<br />
the issues of speed, congestion and the<br />
location and development of major marinas<br />
to facilitate the growing interest of recrea-<br />
tional boaters and allow the port to con-<br />
tinue to grow.<br /><br />
o<br /><br /><br /><br />
Planned Development<br /><br />
If the past is any record of success<br />
then the plans and projects announced<br />
offer the prospect of continued additions<br />
to the commercial, residential and recrea-<br />
tional resources for Baltimore. The follow-<br />
ing are projects planned or underway.<br /><br />
Camden Yards — On the western<br />
boundary of the Inner Harbor projet area<br />
are 22 acres of land including the Camden<br />
Station owned by the CSX System. This<br />
property lies to the immediate west of<br />
Otterbein and is proposed for residences, a<br />
hotel and offices. The first phase —the new<br />
Federal Reserve Bank Building was com-<br />
pleted in November, 1982.<br /><br />
Pratt at Calvert Street — In early 1982<br />
the Rouse Company won the right to<br /><br />
. develop a $190-million hotel/retail/office/<br /><br />
parking eomplex on the vacant lot imme-<br />
diately north of Harborplace along Pratt<br />
Street Boulevard. The Rouse Company has<br />
announced that the Westin Hotel chain will<br />
operate a 550 room hotel. Included in the<br />
complex will be over 600,000 sq. ft. of<br />
commercial space and offices, and a 1200<br />
parking garage.<br /><br />
Pier 4 Power Plant — At the end of<br />
1982 the Six Flags Corporation was selected<br />
by the City to turn the former power plant<br />
on Pier 4 into a family entertainment cen-<br />
ter. The estimated cost of this project is $26<br />
million. Work began on the building in the<br />
fall of 1983.<br /><br />
Light Street High-Rise — The Murdock<br />
Development Corp. has begun the con-<br />
struction of a tower with 165 condomini-<br />
ums and a luxury hotel with parking and<br />
commercial space on the vacant land south<br />
of McCormick’s spice plant on Light Street.<br /><br />
Piers 5 and 6 and the Lower Jones Falls<br />
— Piers 5 and 6 and the east bank of the<br />
Jones Falls present a major new opportun-<br />
ity for continuing the expansion of the<br />
Inner Harbor and are now undergoing in-<br />
tensive planning study. Proposals for this<br />
area include continuing the public walkway<br />
around the entire perimeter of the shore-<br />
line, tying in with the walkways now in<br />
place across piers 3 to 6 and the Inner Har-<br />
bor promenade; installation of marinas;<br />
and public plazas with a dramatic view<br />
across the water to the downtown’s skyline<br />
and harbor ‘activities.<br /><br />
Beyond the Falls Harbor/Little Italy<br />
area is Fells Point where private renovation<br />
is taking place. Ultimately this historic<br />
waterfront neighborhood will be tied to<br />
the Inner Harbor by means of a pedestrian<br />
walkway along the harbor’s edge and rede-<br />
velopment of the intervening land area.<br /><br />
“The Brokerage” — To the north of<br />
the harbor along the Jones Falls, “The<br />
Brokerage” is under development. This $28<br />
million project is being undertaken by a<br />
private developer who is renovating an<br />
entire block of derelict commercial build-<br />
ings for shops and offices, building a ga-<br />
rage and new office space and constructing<br />
a market pavilion in the historic Fish Market<br />
Square.<br /><br />
The excitement that the Inner Harbor<br />
redevelopment has engendered, in Balti-<br />
more, throughout the United States, and in<br />
all parts of the world, is hardly over. The<br />
projects described above and those on the<br />
drawing boards and in prospect make it<br />
obvious Baltimore is not through showing<br />
what can be done with a prime waterfront<br />
location.<br /><br />
In 1963 a friend is said to have told<br />
Mayor McKeldin about his trip to Stock-<br />
holm and what splendid use that city made<br />
of its waterfront. Today delegations from<br />
far corners of the world visit Baltimore to<br />

parking spaces in several locations as<br />
demand increases. Further, the opening of<br />
the first leg of the Baltimore subway should<br />
improve access to the area and alleviate<br />
some of the parking demand.<br />
<br />
Adjacent residential communities of<br />
Little Italy, Federal Hill, and Otterbein are<br />
concerned about the impact on their neigh-<br />
borhoods of heavily attended Inner Harbor<br />
events. The City has developed residential<br />
permit parking programs to limit the park-<br />
ing impact and continues to work with the<br />
neighborhoods to help them maintain their<br />
residential atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Finally, boating safety has become a<br />
growing concern as more and more boat-<br />
ers use the Inner Harbor for recreational<br />
boating. As recreational boats are drawn to<br />
the Inner Harbor’s basin they must navigate<br />
through the country’s fourth most active<br />
port. In the basin itself, a relatively small<br />
water body, tourist boats, pleasure craft,<br />
visiting ships, and paddle boats must com-<br />
pete for limited space and right-of-way.<br />
The Mayor’s Task Force on Boating Safety<br />
was appointed in 1981 to develop ways of<br />
dealing with potential conflicts. Added<br />
police authority to deal with boating infrac-<br />
tions has been implemented as a first step,<br />
and the Task Force continues to address<br />
the issues of speed, congestion and the<br />
location and development of major marinas<br />
to facilitate the growing interest of recrea-<br />
tional boaters and allow the port to con-<br />
tinue to grow.<br />

tugboat companies which line the shore-<br />

The Canton waterfront extends from<br />
Chester Street eastward along Boston Street<br />
to Clinton Street. From the late 18th cen-<br />
tury the Canton Shoreline has been primar-<br />
ily industrial. It was the site for one of the<br />
earliest shipyards, Stodder Brothers, which<br />
was responsible for the construction of the<br />
U.S. Frigate Constellation in 1797. Boston<br />
Street was for many years known as<br />
“Canners Row”’ because of the number of<br />
canning firms located on or near the water-<br />
front. Although the Canton community<br />
extended to the north side of Boston Street<br />
the waterfront was cut-off from public use<br />
because of the industrial activities. It has<br />
only been in the last fifteen years, since the<br />
removal of a number of older buildings in<br />
preparation for the once proposed 1-83,<br />
that the shoreline has become visable and<br />
available to the general public.<br /><br /><br /><br />
Development History<br /><br />
Settled in 1730 by William Fell, Fells<br />
Point was one of the three original settle-<br />
ments which joined together in 1797 to<br />
form the City of Baltimore. Fell had rightly<br />
recognized the unique advantage for ship-<br />
ping that the area’s stable shoreline and<br />
deep water offered. By the mid 18th cen-<br />
tury, Fells Point dominated the other two<br />
settlements, Baltimore Town and Jones<br />
Town, in waterborne commerce and ship-<br />
building. The waterfront was lined with<br />
piers and warehouses, and the community<br />
supported a mixture of commerce and<br />
residential development. Shipbuilding was<br />
a major industry, especially to the east<br />
along Boston Street and in neighboring<br />
Canton.<br /><br />
Most of the Canton waterfront east of<br />
Harris Creek was originally settled by Cap-<br />
tain John O’Donnell who arrived in the<br />
area in 1785. Within a few years O’'Donnell<br />
was the owner of over 2,500 acres stretching<br />
from Harris Creek eastward into the Can-<br />
ton industrial area. His son, Columbus,<br />
joined with Peter Cooper in 1827 to form<br />
the Canton Company. Cooper, In turn,<br />
developed the Boston Street Ironworks,<br />
located at the current site of the American<br />
Can Company. For the next hundred years<br />
the Canton waterfront would be a center<br />
for industrial activity, including cannaries,<br />
box manufacturing, railyards, and special-<br />
ized steel equipment and plate fabrication.<br /><br />
In the 19th and early 20th centuries,<br />
Fells Point was an important entry port for<br />
the great influx of European immigrants.<br />
While many remained only shortly in the<br />
area, Fells Point still boasts a sizable Polish<br />
and Eastern European community.<br /><br />
As technology changed, shipping and<br />
maritime activities gradually moved to other<br />
locations on the harbor. Today many for-<br />
merly active piers have rotted away and a<br />
number of warehouses stand ready to be<br />
renovated into commercial and residential<br />
uses.<br /><br />
In the 1960s an alignment for the Inter-<br />
state 83 expressway was chosen that would<br />
have routed the roadway through the cen-<br />
ter of Fells Point. The City purchased<br />
houses and land to make way for the road.<br />
Realizing the area’s historic character and<br />
the potential for residential and commer-<br />
cial development, citizen’s groups opposed<br />
the alignment and urged the City to seek<br />
other routes. The City responded by pro-<br />
posing that the expressway be built in a<br />
tunnel south of Fells Point. This new align-<br />
ment allowed the houses previously ac-<br />
quired to be sold for rehabilitation. Subse-<br />
quently, the escalating cost of highway con-<br />
struction has prompted the City to propose<br />
lower cost alternatives.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

piers and warehouses, and the community<br />
supported a mixture of commerce and<br />
residential development. Shipbuilding was<br />
a major industry, especially to the east<br />
along Boston Street and in neighboring<br />
Canton.<br />
<br />
Most of the Canton waterfront east of<br />
Harris Creek was originally settled by Cap-<br />
tain John O’Donnell who arrived in the<br />
area in 1785. Within a few years O’'Donnell<br />
was the owner of over 2,500 acres stretching<br />
from Harris Creek eastward into the Can-<br />
ton industrial area. His son, Columbus,<br />
joined with Peter Cooper in 1827 to form<br />
the Canton Company. Cooper, In turn,<br />
developed the Boston Street Ironworks,<br />
located at the current site of the American<br />
Can Company. For the next hundred years<br />
the Canton waterfront would be a center<br />
for industrial activity, including cannaries,<br />
box manufacturing, railyards, and special-<br />
ized steel equipment and plate fabrication.<br />
<br />
In the 19th and early 20th centuries,<br />
Fells Point was an important entry port for<br />
the great influx of European immigrants.<br />
While many remained only shortly in the<br />
area, Fells Point still boasts a sizable Polish<br />
and Eastern European community.<br />
<br />
As technology changed, shipping and<br />
maritime activities gradually moved to other<br />
locations on the harbor. Today many for-<br />
merly active piers have rotted away and a<br />
number of warehouses stand ready to be<br />
renovated into commercial and residential<br />
uses.<br />
<br />
In the 1960s an alignment for the Inter-<br />
state 83 expressway was chosen that would<br />
have routed the roadway through the cen-<br />
ter of Fells Point. The City purchased<br />
houses and land to make way for the road.<br />
Realizing the area’s historic character and<br />
the potential for residential and commer-<br />
cial development, citizen’s groups opposed<br />
the alignment and urged the City to seek<br />
other routes. The City responded by pro-<br />
posing that the expressway be built in a<br />
tunnel south of Fells Point. This new align-<br />
ment allowed the houses previously ac-<br />
quired to be sold for rehabilitation. Subse-<br />
quently, the escalating cost of highway con-<br />
struction has prompted the City to propose<br />
lower cost alternatives.<br />

xisting Conditions<br /><br />
Industrial and Port Activity: Even<br />
though several former industrial buildings<br />
are being converted to housing, most of<br />
Fells Point’s waterfront is still zoned for<br />
industrial activity. There are four primary<br />
industrial activities in Fells Point: warehous-<br />
ing, maritime services, a concrete batching<br />
plant, and a large chemical plant.<br /><br />
At the extreme western tip of Fells<br />
Point is the Allied Chemical Corp. plant on<br />
Philpot Street. The plant manufactures chro-<br />
mium chemicals and compoufids.<br /><br />
Also located along the western boun-<br />
dary of the area are several metal parts<br />
warehouses and the H &amp;S Bakery.<br /><br />
Around Broadway are several ware-<br />
housing operations, the most notable being<br />
Rukert Terminal Corp., which has operated<br />
in Fells Point for a number of years at the<br />
foot of Broadway and in several historic<br />
warehouses along Thames Street. Also<br />
located adjacent to Broadway are several<br />
ship chandlers who supply goods to ships<br />
for their operations. :<br /><br />
There are two major industrial opera-<br />
tions east of Broadway; one is the Arundel<br />
Corp.’s concrete batching plant on Wolfe<br />
Street, the second is Belt’'s Wharf with two<br />
active warehouses on Fell Street and a ware-<br />
house operation on Aliceanna Street in the<br />
old National Can Company building. Raw<br />
materials at the Arundel Corp., which are<br />
delivered by barge, are mixed to form con-<br />
crete which is then trucked to construction<br />
sites in the region.<br /><br />
In the Canton area, along Boston Street<br />
at Lakewood, is a cluster of large industrial<br />
and warehouse buildings including the old<br />
J. S. Young factory, now vacant expect for<br />
warehousing in several large buildings; R.<br />
Renneburg and Sons, manufacturer of steel<br />
machine products; two large warehouses<br />
between Boston Street and the harbor; and<br />
the American Can Co. plant covering sev-<br />
eral city blocks on the northside of Boston<br />
Street at O’Donnell Street.<br /><br />
Towing companies on Boston Street<br />
and at the Recreation Pier, are the major<br />
maritime businesses now along the Fells<br />
Point shoreline. The City Pier at the foot of<br />
Broadway is also occasionally used as a<br />
temporary mooring for cargo ships waiting<br />
assignment to a pier in another part of the<br />
harbor. The City’s Marine Police Unit was<br />
located for many years at Broadway Pier in<br />
Fells Point. The unit has now moved to Pier<br />
6 in the Inner Harbor, in temporary<br />
facilities.<br /><br />
At the eastern end of Boston Street is<br />
NBC Lines where containers are consoli-<br />
dated from other ports and distributed to<br /><br /><br /><br />
Maritime activities, tugs at the Recreation Pier<br /><br />
larger ships for shipment or inland<br />
destinations.<br /><br />
Commercial Activity: Fells Point pro-<br />
vides a diverse mix of commercial activity.<br />
Associated with the area’s towing compan-<br />
ies are ship chandlers who supply provisions<br />
and services to ships docking in the Balti-<br />
more harbor. Along Broadway, the area’s<br />
commercial spine, there are hardware<br />
stores, banks, secondhand and specialty<br />
shops, antique stores, and restaurants. And,<br />
there are the taverns. Fells Point contains<br />
one of the highest concentrations of tav-<br />
erns of any community in the City. The bars<br />
attract an interesting clientele of visiting sail-<br />
ors, young singles, local residents, and tour-<br />
ists. Fells Point’s open stall Broadway<br />
Market also draws customers from the en-<br />
tire region. This mix of commercial activity<br />
is considered one of Fells Point’s major<br />
assets.<br /><br />
Residential Areas: There has been a<br />
strong residential community in Fells Point<br />
since the founding in the early 18th cen-<br />
tury. Originally houses were built in Fells<br />
Point for those who worked nearby in the<br />
port and in related maritime businesses.<br />
During the 19th century, Fells Point became<br />
the home of thousands of Eastern European<br />
immigrants many of whose descendents still<br />
live in the area.<br /><br />
During the 1960s a trickle of new resi-<br />
dents, many artists and “urban pioneers,”<br />
discovered Fells Point. As the appeal of liv-<br />
ing in an historic community adjacent to the<br />
harbor grew, increasing numbers of people<br /><br />
began to move into the community to ren-<br />
ovate its 19th-century brick rowhouses. To-<br />
day, the market for housing in Fells Point<br />
has advanced to the point that developers<br />
have proposed converting many of the<br />
area’s abandoned warehouses to condo-<br />
miniums and apartments and constructing<br />
new townhouses on vacant land.<br /><br />
Recreation Areas: To provide a focal<br />
point for the community, the City invested<br />
more than $1 million to construct a brick-<br />
paved plaza in the bed of South Broadway<br />
between Lancaster and Thames Streets. The<br />
plaza is used for community events and fes-<br />
tivals as well as a place to watch the bustling<br />
activity which is a day-to-day occurrence in<br />
Fells Point. The City has also constructed a<br />
neighborhood park with a play area for<br />
small children, green space, and gazebo at<br />
the corner of Thames and Wolfe Streets.<br />
Besides these new facilities, the Recreation<br />
Pier with a second-story outdoor basketball<br />
court and its indoor game room has long<br />
been a valuable resource for the Fells Point<br />
community. In 1984 the Chester Street Park<br />
and Promenade was completed.<br /><br />
In the Canton area there is a small<br />
recreation center with courts and play<br />
equipment and several playfields at East<br />
and Ellwood Streets. The City has also con-<br />
structed a public pier at Boston and Lake-<br />
wood Streets.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Planned Development<br /><br />
Private: The composition of the Fells<br />
Point/Canton shoreline is rapidly changing.<br />
This is evidenced by the following projects.<br /><br />
*The Anchorage: In late 1982 construc-<br />
tion began on the Anchorage, a devel-<br />
opment which in the first phase in-<br />
cludes 40 townhouses overlooking a<br />
public waterfront promenade and an 80<br />
slip marina. The second phase of the<br />
project includes construction of an ad-<br />
dition 700 feet of the public prome-<br />
nade, a 260 slip marina and yacht club<br />
and a high-rise condominium. The pro-<br />
menade will provide almost one-<br />
quarter mile of public shoreline access.<br /><br /><br /><br />
*Thames Point: The Wolfe Street por-<br />
tion of the former National Can Co.<br />
plant has been renovated into approxi-<br />
mately 32 rental units, with the first re-<br />
served for commercial activity. A public<br />
boardwalk and a small marina for 50<br />
boats have also been developed. Work<br />
has begun on Phase Il of the project<br />
which will develop 87 additional units.<br /><br />
Henderson’s Wharf: The former B&amp; O<br />
warehouse on Fell Street and the adja-<br />
cent tip of land that was the original<br />
Fells Point have been awarded to a firm<br />
to redevelop as a complex of apart-<br /><br />
| ments, inn, commercial space and a 225<br />
slip marina. The shoreline around the<br />
vacant parcel and the ground floor of<br />
the building is to be a public prome-<br />
nade. Development in the future could<br />

developer of the former National Can<br />
Company building at Wolfe and Ali-<br /><br />

portion of its property at Chester Street.<br />
In return, the developer has constructed a<br />
public shoreline promenade, landscape<br />
a small park and plant street trees along<br />
Chester Street. This will enhance one of<br />
the most important links between the<br />
community and the waterfront and pro-<br />
vide another portion of the shoreline<br />
walk.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Jackson Building: A company which<br />
manufactures products for air filters has<br />
rehabilitated the industrial building at<br />
Boston Street, east of Linwood. The<br />
company has provided a well designed<br />
building which provides jobs and can<br />
co-exist with future waterfront uses.<br /><br />
Public: The City of Baltimore has pro-<br />
grammed a number of projects in Fells<br />
Point and along the Canton waterfront<br />
to encourage and support private resi-<br />
dential and commercial development.<br /><br />
Street Rehabilitation and Reconstruc-<br />
tion: There are a number of local<br />
streets which are slated for either re-<br />
habilitation or complete reconstruction.<br />
These include Thames, Wolfe, Lancas-<br />
ter, Shakespeare, Bethel, Fleet, and<br />
Eastern. The most extensive public in-<br />
vestment in Fells Point will be the up-<br />
grading of streets between the existing<br />
Jones Falls Expressway and Interstate 95<br />
presently under construction in Canton.<br />
At one time planned as a full, limited<br />
access expressway passing south of<br />
Fells Point in a tunnel, the City has pro-<br />
posed more modest designs due to es-<br />
calating construction costs. This would<br />
include improvements to Fleet and Ali-<br />
ceanna Streets and reconstruction of<br />
Boston Street.<br /><br />
*Broadway Market Renovation: Now<br />
that improvements to the market’s<br />
south shed have been completed, the<br />
City is undertaking various further im-<br />
provements to the north shed. Many of<br />
these were initiated in 1982. Recon-<br />
struction of the north facade should be<br />
completed in early 1984.<br /><br />
*Boston Street Pier: A small pier is<br />
under censtruction on the shoreline at<br />
Boston and O’Donnell Streets to give<br />
public access to the water’s edge and<br />
to provide a place for small boat moor-<br />
ing. The project is funded by the fed-<br />
eral Coastal Energy Impact Program<br />
with assistance from the State’s Water-<br />
way Improvement Division.<br /><br />
*Public Waterfront Access: In conjunc-<br />
tion with several private development<br />
projects, public promenades, walkways,<br />
and small parks will be built along the<br />
shoreline using funds from the federal<br />
Urban Development Action Grant Pro-<br />
gram, other federal and state sources,<br />
and private capital. Designed to insure<br />
that the public has access to the shore-<br />
line, these improvements will be con-<br />
structed at the same time as the accom-<br />
panying private development.<br />"," <br />
<br />
Planned Development<br />
<br />
Private: The composition of the Fells<br />
Point/Canton shoreline is rapidly changing.<br />
This is evidenced by the following projects.<br />
<br />
*The Anchorage: In late 1982 construc-<br />
tion began on the Anchorage, a devel-<br />
opment which in the first phase in-<br />
cludes 40 townhouses overlooking a<br />
public waterfront promenade and an 80<br />
slip marina. The second phase of the<br />
project includes construction of an ad-<br />
dition 700 feet of the public prome-<br />
nade, a 260 slip marina and yacht club<br />
and a high-rise condominium. The pro-<br />
menade will provide almost one-<br />
quarter mile of public shoreline access.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
*Thames Point: The Wolfe Street por-<br />
tion of the former National Can Co.<br />
plant has been renovated into approxi-<br />
mately 32 rental units, with the first re-<br />
served for commercial activity. A public<br />
boardwalk and a small marina for 50<br />
boats have also been developed. Work<br />
has begun on Phase Il of the project<br />
which will develop 87 additional units.<br />
<br />
Henderson’s Wharf: The former B& O<br />
warehouse on Fell Street and the adja-<br />
cent tip of land that was the original<br />
Fells Point have been awarded to a firm<br />
to redevelop as a complex of apart-<br />
<br />
| ments, inn, commercial space and a 225<br />
slip marina. The shoreline around the<br />
vacant parcel and the ground floor of<br />
the building is to be a public prome-<br />
nade. Development in the future could<br />
expand to also include waterfront<br />
townhouses and provide parking on<br />
adjacent properties.<br />
<br />

ssues and Problems<br /><br />
The prospect of a significant growth in<br />
residential development poses several<br />
important issues for Fells Point and the<br />
Canton waterfront.<br /><br />
First, there are the potential difficulties<br />
that could develop between the newer resi-<br />
dents and long-term residents. The influx<br />
of new residents could dilute the influence<br />
over community activities exercised by resi-<br />
dents who have lived in Fells Point and<br />
Canton for many years. This in turn could<br />
undermine the uniquely European quality<br />
and stable home ownership which has<br />
been one of the area’s appealing character-<br />
istics. The influx of new residents also pre-<br />
sents a potential economic threat to Fells<br />
Point and Canton’s long-standing residents.<br />
It is feared that the influx of new residents,<br />
who are able to pay much higher prices for<br />
their homes, will drive up property values<br />
so high that moderate-income residents<br />
will no longer be able to afford to pay pro-<br />
perty taxes and will have to leave the com-<br />
munity. Both the social and economic<br />
issues posed by the rapid development of<br />
more expensive housing in Fells Point and<br />
by adjacent construction in Canton will<br />
have to be addressed if the communities<br />
are to retain the diversity that are their<br />
hallmark.<br /><br />
A second issue raised by the changing<br />
character of the area is the provision of an<br />
adequate number of parking spaces for the<br />
new uses, including residential and com-<br />
mercial development and the proposed<br />
marinas. If all the proposed marina slips in<br />
the Fells Point/Canton waterfront were<br />
developed as commercial facilities between<br />
600 and 750 parking spaces would have to<br />
be provided. This in addition to spaces<br />
required for new apartments and condo-<br />
miniums, offices, shops and restaurants.<br />
There are clearly not enough spaces cur-<br />
rently available. Larger projects will have to<br />
consider new parking structures or convert-<br />
ing portions of older buildings into parking<br />
facilities.<br /><br />
Another issue is the potential conflict<br />
between the new housing development and<br />
industrial activity in the area. New middle-<br />
and-upper-ihcome residents are not likely<br />
to enjoy the truck traffic, trains, noise, and<br />
dust associated with heavy industry. At the<br />
same time the City will not want to dis-<br />
courage job-creating industries by severely<br />
restricting the scope of their activity. The<br />
difficult challenge facing the City in the<br />
years ahead will be to situate and phase<br />
new residential development to minimize<br />
direct conflicts with existing industry.<br /><br />
Another arena of potential conflict is<br />
the harbor itself. Many of the proposals for<br />
waterfront housing in both Fells Point and<br />
Canton include marinas in their plans. As<br />
the number of pleasure craft docked on the<br />
shoreline grows there is increasing likeli-<br />
hood of conflicts with the work boats sta-<br />
tioned at Fells Point and other areas of the<br />
harbor. To avoid potential conflicts, marina<br />
proposals will be reviewed with commer-<br />
cial shippers and towing companies so that<br />
revisions can.be made to the plans to insure<br />
the safety of the waterways for all vessels.<br />
The City is also preparing guidelines for<br />
marina development to assist in the loca-<br />
tion, configuration, and size of future<br />
marinas.<br /><br />
A final issue is insuring that private<br />
developers of waterfront land continue to<br />
provide public access to the shoreline.<br />
While most of the shoreline in Fells Point<br />
and Canton is privately owned, it is City<br />
policy that the public at large be guaran-<br />
teed access t8 the harbor, which is consi-<br />
dered a public resource. As development in<br />
Fells Point and Canton increases, the City<br />
will continue to work with developers to<br />
design public walkways, parks, and prome-<br />
nades compatible with the privately spon-<br />
sored projects.<br /><br /><br /><br />

warehouses and commercial buildings<br />
stand ready for rehabilitation. Derelict piers<br />
and crumbling shorelines could be rebuilt<br />
for marinas, public promenades, and water-<br />
front parks.<br /><br />
Among the most promising future<br />
development sites on the western shoreline<br />
of Fells Point are: .<br /><br />
*Brown’s Wharf: Located at Thames<br />
Street, this parcel includes just over an<br />
acre of vacant land on the waterfront<br />
and the historic Brown’s Wharf, ware-<br />
houses constructed in the early 19th<br />
century.<br /><br />
*Terminal Corp. Warehouse: A large<br />
brick warehouse on Thames Street with<br />
waterfront on three sides. One of the<br />
most prominent buildings along the<br />
Fells Point waterfront. =<br /><br />
*Jackson Wharf: Just west of the Ter-<br />
minal warehouse on Thames at Caro-<br />
line, Jackson’s Wharf is also a large<br />
brick warehouse with access to the<br />
shoreline. There is also a small amount<br />
of vacant land adjacent to the building<br />
along the waterfront.<br /><br />
The above sites and a number of<br />
properties inland are currently owned by a<br />
developer.<br /><br />
The Canton waterfront was designated<br />
an urban renewal area in 1984. There are<br />
several opportunities along this shoreline to<br />
provide facilities for both new residents<br />
and visitors as well as Canton’s existing<br />
citizens:<br /><br />
*]. S. Young Property: Located in Can-<br />
ton on Boston Street this parcel and the<br />
adjoining properties of the John Ren-<br />
neberg Co. and Marine Repair Services<br />
offer long-range redevelopment poten-<br />
tial. Preliminary plans have been pre-<br />
pared for the J. S. Young property<br />
which includes a recreationally oriented<br />
office/commercial complex and a full-<br />
service marina. -<br /><br /><br /><br />
*Canton Waterfront Park: The City,<br />
with assistance from the State’s Depart-<br />
ment of Natural Resources is moving<br />
to purchase approximately ten acres of<br />
waterfront land at Boston Street<br />
between Linwood and Clinton Streets.<br />
The site will be developed for a large<br />
waterfront park, a boat launch, and as<br />
a permanent home for Baltimore’s<br />
Marine Police and DPW’s Marine<br />
Division.<br /><br />
*Vacant Land North of Boston Street:<br />
Working with the Canton community,<br />
the City has proposed redevelopment<br />
of approximately 16 acres of vacant .<br />
land. The proposal envisions an expan-<br />
sion of the existing park immediately to<br />
the east and development of the re-<br />
maining 11 acres of land for town-<br />
houses compatable with the Canton<br />
community. This includes a nursing<br />
home and approximately 160 units of<br />
moderately priced housing.<br /><br />
*Linwood Associates Building: This<br />
large warehouse at Boston and Lin-<br />
wood offers redevelopment opportuni-<br />
ties for a variety of uses. The ground<br />
floor could provide much needed<br />
parking and the building offer excel-<br />
lent views of Ft. McHenry and the port.<br /><br />
