the basement<br />\nof the Hopkins Union, was stolen<br />\nlast night by what was described<br />\nas a \"well- equipped and<br />\ningenious\" group of vandals.<br />\nThe large-scale . theft<br />\nculminates nine months of<br />\nvandalism in the Rathskellar<br />\nwhich saw bar stools, beer mugs,<br />\nand decorations stolen.<br />\nThe facility was apparently<br />\nwrenched loose from its steel<br />\nreinforced cement moorings late<br />\nlast night, the officials said.<br />\n\"They'd taken everything<br />\nelse,\" observed Hopkins Union<br />\nDirector Alan Sapakie. \"I guess it<br />\nwas just a matter of time before<br />\nthey took the facility,in toto.\"<br />\nSapakie and Security Director<br />\nGeorge Weinbach speculated that<br />\nthe vandals, probably<br />\nundergraduates, stole the facility<br />\nwith a twin-rotary helicopter and<br />\nseveral long iron grappling hooks.<br />\n\"It must've been a hell of a<br />\nnoise when the son of a bitch<br />\ncame loose,\" said Weinbach. \"I'm<br />\nsurprised none of our security<br />\npolice were alerted by the<br />\ncommotion.\"<br />\nSapakie admitted that he was<br />\nin the Rathskellar at the time of<br />\nthe larceny but asserted that the<br />\noperation was so well-executed<br />\nthat he was not aware the facility<br />\nhad been stolen until he \"felt a<br />\ndraft.\"<br />\n\"I wish I could help you<br />\nbut...\" stuttered Sapakie.<br />\n<br />\nProvost Harry Woolf expressed<br />\nthe administration's shock at the<br />\nnews of the theft. \"We were<br />\nproud to have a facility of the<br />\nRathskellar's demonstrated<br />\nefficiency and appeal in the<br />\nUniversity community.\"<br />\nStudent Council<br />\nPresident-elect Mike Lenardo<br />\nannounced that the SC will<br />\nrecommend to the administration<br />\nthat an intensive search be held<br />\n<br />\nto apprehend the vandals. \"I<br />\nwant something done about it,<br />\nbecause I do not like punitive<br />\nlenience, and besides I wrote a<br />\ngreat housing report.\"<br />\nSapakie said that all social<br />\nprogramming in the Rathskellar<br />\nwill be discontinued, in light of<br />\nthe theft. \"It [social<br />\nprogramming in a non-existent<br />\nfacility] would probably not be a<br />\ngood idea,\" he said.<br />\nAssistant Dean of Students<br />\nDottie Lebo is currently<br />\nattempting to organize an<br />\n\"amnesty night\" for the return<br />\nof the Rathskellar.<br />\n\"Whoever did this should<br />\nknow that they can return that<br />\nlovely bar

/>\nBaltimore Orioles baseball<br />\nfranchise amid reports that<br />\nUniversity officials plan to move<br />\nthe team to Bologna.<br />\nThe sale of the \"Birds\" to<br />\nHopkins caught most<br />\nBaltimoreans off guard, since the<br />\nsale of the team to a group of<br />\nbusinessmen led by Bill Veeck<br />\nwas considered almost completed<br />\nby most city officials.<br />\nJerry Hoffberger's decision to<br />\nsell the team to Hopkins was<br />\napparently spurred by the State<br />\nLegislature's failure to grant the<br />\nVeeck group a $4 million loan to<br />\nfinance the purchase.<br />\nVice President for Business<br />\nManagement Robert Bowie said<br />\nthat the team was purchased for<br />\n$12 million and would be<br />\nfinanced by borrowing money<br />\nfrom the University's<br />\nendowment. The endowment will<br />\n<br />\nbe replenished by the profits of<br />\nthe baseball team, he stated.<br />\nBowie also disclosed that \"a<br />\nlarge part of the sum\" will never<br />\nhave to be paid, since Hoffberger<br />\nhas agreed to \"donate\" some of<br />\nthe money to the University, a<br />\nnon-profit institution.<br />\nPresident Muller told reporters<br />\nyesterday that he is pleased with<br />\nthe move, engineered primarily<br />\nby D.H. Harvey, Chairman of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees as well as<br />\nchairman of the Board of<br />\nMaryland Natielal Park.<br />\n\"As far as I know, we're the<br />\nfirst University anywhere to<br />\nmake such a move,\" Muller said<br />\nproudly.<br />\nMuller informed the press that<br />\nHopkins does not plan, much to<br />\nthe ire of many local residents, to<br />\nkeep the Orioles in Baltimore.<br />\nInstead, they will be moved, to<br />\nBologna Italy, where Hopkins<br />\nmaintains a branch of its School<br />\nfor Advanced International<br />\n<br />\nGutzman replacement protested<br />\nBy PHIL LAZARUS<br />\nThe New-Letter learned from<br />\ninformed sources yesterday that<br />\nthe University has replaced<br />\nGeorge Gutzman, Assistant<br />\nDirector of Personnel<br />\nMaintenance, who died last<br />\nNovember.<br />\n\"Though we were happy to<br />\nhave a man of Gutzman's<br />\ndemonstrated ability on the<br />\nstaff,\" explained Provost Harry<br />\nWoolf, \"we feel that it [the<br />\ndeath] will have a negative effect<br />\non his output potential.\"<br />\nThe move has sparked<br />\ncontroversy from faculty<br />\nmembers and students<br />\nconcerning the legitimacy of<br />\nreplacing an employeee because<br />\nof death.<br />\nRic Pfeffer', Professor of<br />\nPolitical Science, described the<br />\nreplacement of Gutzman as \"a<br />\nsloppy decision, full of<br />\nloop-holes.\"<br />\n\"This is just one more<br />\nexcuse,\" he continued, \"that the<br />\nadministration can use to get rid<br />\nof someone who isn't to their<br />\nliking.\"<br />\nOne University employee, who<br />\n<br />\nRemains of the Rathskellar<br />\n<br />\nasked not to be identified, said<br />\nthat he has asked Hopkins'<br />\nAffirmative Action coordinator,<br />\nYvonne Theodore, to check the<br />\nHEW guidelines for employment<br />\nquotas of dead people.<br />\nTheodore said yesterday that<br />\nshe is \"not quite exactly sure<br />\nwhat are the regulations<br />\nconcerning the hiring of dead<br />\npeople,\" but will examine them<br />\nclosely to prevent any<br />\ndisgruntled dead people from<br />\ntaking \"legal recourse against<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nThe sources also revealed that<br />\nthe Student Council has launched<br />\nanother committee to investigate<br />\nthe University's policy of<br />\nreplacing dead employees.<br />\nSC president-elect Mike<br />\nLenardo, in an interview<br />\nyesterday, refused to<br />\nacknowledge the existence of<br />\nsuch a committee, but did state,<br />\n\"I wrote a great housing report.\"<br />\nPresident Muller explained<br />\nthat the policy of replacing dead<br />\nemployees has been in existence<br />\nat Hopkins since at least the<br />\nEisenhower tenure.<br />\n\"As far as I'm concerned, it's<br />\n<br />\nan historical accident. I didn't<br />\ninstitute the policy, but I see no<br />\nreason to change it,\" he said.<br />\n\"The way I see things, our<br />\npolicy is the best way to handle<br />\nit [death],\" Muller added.<br />\n\"Frankly, I think it's emminently<br />\nfair.\"<br />\nUniversity Chaplain Chet<br />\nWickwire said that he has written<br />\na letter to the Board of Trustees<br />\nasking that they investigate the<br />\nUniversity employee policy<br />\nregarding dead people.<br />\n\"On the surface, it doesn't<br />\nreally seem very fair to me,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nJesus H. Christ<br />\n\"Also, I think lie may have<br />\nsome reservations about this<br />\npolicy, so we probably should<br />\nlook into it,\" Wickwire asserted.<br />\nDirector of the Union and<br />\nStudent Activities Alan Sapakie,<br />\nwho was a close personal friend<br />\nof Gutzman's, said \"In theory, I<br />\ncan understand why Guzzy was<br />\nreplaced. But as for this specifie<br />\nincident I really can't help you.\"<br />\n\"I wish I could say more, but<br />\nI'm not dead,\" Sapakie<br />\nremarked.<br />\n<br />\nStudy (SAIS).<br />\nIncluded in the deal with<br />\nHoffberger was a pledge from the<br />\ncity to grant the University full<br />\naccess to Memorial Stadium for<br />\nthe next 20 years.<br />\n\"Getting the Stadium was pure<br />\ngravy,\" commented Bowie.<br />\n\"We'll probably use it for some<br />\nof our big lecture classes, and of<br />\n<br />\ncourse, the important Lacrosse<br />\ngames.\"<br />\nMuller said that one of his top<br />\npriorities, now that the<br />\nUniversity has the stadium, will<br />\nbe to remove the obstructed view<br />\nseats, long a gripe of Oriole and<br />\nColt fans.<br />\nsee WAYNE HOOD, page 7<br />\n<br />\nSeuss appointed to<br />\nEnglish dept. post<br />\nBy JAMES ALLEN<br />\nDean of Arts and Sciences<br />\neorge Owen announced<br />\nyesterday the ,appointment of<br />\nrenowned children's author Dr.<br />\nSeuss . as Professor of Modern<br />\nLiterature in the English<br />\n, Department.<br />\nOwen said that the<br />\nappointment, which is effective<br />\nthis July, is part of a<br />\n'newly-initiated reorganization of<br />\nthe English department.<br />\n\"Dr. Seuss's appointment fills<br />\n'a need in our department,\" said<br />\nEnglish Chairman Ronald<br />\nPaulson. \"Usually we don't deal<br />\nwith ancillary topics, but we are<br />\n.always wont to make<br />\nexceptions.\"<br />\nPaulson revealed that Seuss<br />\nwill teach one undergraduate<br />\ncourse next semester before<br />\ntaking a one-year leave of<br />\nabsence.<br />\nSeuss specializes in modern<br />\nliterature, fantasy writing, and<br />\nscript-writing for television<br />\n,specials, and will offer graduate<br />\nseminars in \"character creation.\"<br />\nSeuss's acc laimed works<br />\ninclude The Cat in the Hat, The<br />\nCat in the Hat Comes Bac k The<br />\nGrinch That Stole Christmas, and<br />\nOne Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish,<br />\nBlue Fish.<br />\nCommenting on the<br />\nappointment, Provost Harry<br />\nWoolf noted, \"We are pleased to<br />\nhave a man of Seuss's<br />\ndemonstrated ability on our<br />\nfaculty.\"<br />\nSeuss, presently an Associate<br />\nProfessor of Writing at Beloit<br />\nCollege, has been awarded a full<br />\nprofessorship with tenure by the<br />\n.

Brand, who was trying<br />\nto develop a pure, elemental,<br />\nAryan sound by tracking it down<br />\nto its very source, was expelled<br />\nfrom the group, which feared the<br />\ndionysian dimensions of its own<br />\nnew sound.<br />\nNow led by Gustav Aschenbach,<br />\nwith the powerful help of<br />\npercussionists Alfred and Bertha<br />\nKrupp and Fritz Ebert on electric<br />\ntuba, Bundesrepublik fights a<br />\nlonely war against decadence in the<br />\ngenre of uber-rock, which it largely<br />\ncreated but which has been<br />\nmonopolized of late by such<br />\nupstart, vulgar imitators as<br />\nKraftwerk (q.v. their inane album<br />\nAutobahn), which plays the Civic<br />\nCenter tomorrow night.<br />\nBundesrepublik's third and<br />\nlatest album, Anschluss, supplied<br />\nthe material for the second half of<br />\ntheir Shriver Hall concert. The<br />\nelectronic marches on this album<br />\nare compelling, the lyrics so<br />\nerudite (perhaps even recondite)<br />\nthat only a handful of people in<br />\nthe world really understand them.<br />\n<br />\nAs is our wont, we've been<br />\nwondering lately about journalism.<br />\nH.L. Mencken said that the<br />\npurpose of journalism is to take<br />\nnote of trends. And that's what we<br />\n,try to do, by and large \u2014 observe<br />\ntrends, bring them to the public<br />\nattention, and comment adversely<br />\non the ones we feel contempt for.<br />\nBut, unfortunately, our<br />\nwonderings go deeper than that.<br />\nLike, for instance, how far can<br />\ncommentary on these trends go'?<br />\nCan one write%artye.nton in his present<br />\nre<br />\nr-v-rceW-ye.teiu4y LU JUL11 Lll. aut YV 1111 Lair,<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nof merit scholarships and the<br />\nfantasized benefits that Hopkins<br />\nwould derive from them.<br />\nDigging into the vilest<br />\nbackwaters of the administration<br />\nvocabulary, Denton asserted that<br />\nthe merit scholarships will<br />\n\"provide visibility\" for the<br />\nUniversity and \"enhance the size.<br />\nof the applicant pool.\"<br />\nCan one go that far? Regardless,<br />\none just did.<br />\nAnd the lengths to which one<br />\n5;lepepd of course, on how<br />\n<br />\ndiscriminating a usage one makes<br />\nof information obtained in<br />\ninterviews. This discourse,<br />\nespecially on the administrative<br />\nlevel, is divided into three<br />\ncategories \u2014 ordinary quotable<br />\ninformation, information which<br />\ncan be printed but not explicitly<br />\nattributed, and information which<br />\njust can't be printed at all, \"off the<br />\nrecord,\" as it were.<br />\nThe distinction between the<br />\nlatter two divisions is nebulous at<br />\nbest, and we're often hard put to<br />\ndetermine into which (lc ti-te<br />\n<br />\nSonny Battaglia<br />\n<br />\nbe proper to try to pick up on the<br />\nstory. Very briefly. Then we tried<br />\nto piece together what we'd heard<br />\nso we could get on to it. But even<br />\nthe most assiduous sleuthing<br />\nproved fruitless, because the<br />\nvarious forces involved had<br />\narranged an omerta. Nobody<br />\nwould tell us anything. Except<br />\nSapakie, who told us that he<br />\nwished he could help us.<br />\nA scant week after preventing us<br />\nfrom taking note of that trend, one<br />\n<br />\nGottfried Dietze (known as the<br />\nreichskanzler of rock; his own<br />\ngroup Die Fugnoten, recently<br />\ntoured the west coast) has banned<br />\nthe Bundesrepublik's music from<br />\nthe airwaves because of its<br />\nsubversive political overtones. Tom<br />\nWolfe shares his negative opinion<br />\nof the group \u2014 he recently referred<br />\nto them as a bunch of maniacs. But<br />\nthe audience that heard<br />\nBundesrepublik at Shriver knows<br />\nbetter. The group's next concert is<br />\nApril 20 at the Roosevelt Coliseum<br />\nin Jersey City.

And here's where Heist fits<br />\nin, see, because we want him to be<br />\ndirector of that office, see.<br />\nBecause, frankly, we can't think of<br />\nanyone more equipped to do<br />\nexactly what the administration<br />\nwants to do about the Academic<br />\nReports than him.<br />\nAs Director of Academic<br />\nReports, Heist would really wish<br />\nhe could help you.<br />\nWe've observed, commented,<br />\njeez even proposed something.<br />\nMencken would be proud.<br />\nM.D.<br />\n<br />\nCY() St.e<br />\n<br />\ntlictinwrich<br />\n<br />\nHunter Thompson<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI want to officially tell you<br />\nHopkins people why I had to close<br />\nB&M's.
