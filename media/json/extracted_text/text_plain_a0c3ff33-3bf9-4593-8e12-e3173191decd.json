Students, according to<br />\nthe good Dean, should keep their noses out of such<br />\nmatters as institutional finances and mind their own<br />\nbusiness.<br />\nThis unfortunate expression of the subconscious<br />\nreaffirms our view that the student is only an incidental guest at Hopkins. It would be wise to remember<br />\nthat an administration is only a glorified janitor, making sure all the parts are running to the satisfaction of<br />\nthe scholars and students.<br />\nThere is a phenomenon in social theory that explains the syndrome of the Hopkins administration. It<br />\nseems that organizations are created to reach goals.<br />\nWhen they lose sight of their goal, or become sidetracked, the organization often works only to perpetuate itself.

One might also<br />\nwonder whether it matters.<br />\nThe reason it does not matter<br />\nis that it is not Lincoln Gordon,<br />\nor anyone else in the Administration, who is going to do something toward bridging the very<br />\nconsiderable bap between what<br />\nHopkins is and what a university<br />\nshould be. That is simply not<br />\nwhat he is being paid a substantial salary to do. Lincoln Gordon,<br />\nwhether he turns out to be a<br />\nliberal administrator or a repressive one, is going to try to insure that Hopkins remains a safe<br />\nplace for the services to government and industry that seem to<br />\nbe its raison d'etre. He and his<br />\ncolleagues are going to oppose<br />\nany serious efforts made, by<br />\n\"direct action\" or otherwise, to<br />\ndemocratize the university, to<br />\nchange its orientation or to force<br />\nit to come to terms with the<br />\nsociety around it. If it is only up<br />\nto Lincoln Gordon, Hopkins is<br />\ngoing to remain a de facto subsidiary of the State Department<br />\nand the Pentagon although if he<br />\ndoes his job well it may become<br />\na bigger and better one.<br />\nWhat is needed therefore is for<br />\nstudents to start showing that<br />\nthey care about this. The top priority for anyone who has pretensions to being a student lea-<br />\n<br />\nder should be the creation of effective student structures, independent of all forms of outside<br />\ncontrol, so that the voice of the<br />\nstudents on the campus can be<br />\nheard. The problems in student<br />\norganization at Hopkins are of a<br />\nvery basic nature. They are also<br />\nof crucial importance because of<br />\nthe magnitude of what has to be<br />\ndone and the scope of what an<br />\neffective student union can<br />\nachieve.<br />\n<br />\nwith which Hopkins students<br />\nmust come to grips, and soon.<br />\nYours faithfully.<br />\nRobert Chodos<br />\n<br />\nSpotty Make-Up<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nCongratulations for an exceptional first issue\u2014a very good<br />\nand complete job of news, features and analysis.<br />\nBut what are you going to do<br />\nabout that awful printing job.

It<br />\ndoes not, however, attempt to<br />\nprevent cheating in any active<br />\nsense, except, perhaps, insofar as<br />\nit orients newcomers in our community. he prevention of cheating is a matter of individual concern, to be decided by each member of this community in accordance with his own attitudes and<br />\ninclinations.<br />\n<br />\nPart of one's responsibility under the Honor Code is to report<br />\nsuspected violators. This responsibility, however, is not on4<br />\nwhich the Honor Commission<br />\ncan enforce. Nor is it one which<br />\nshould be enforced by the Honor<br />\nCommission, for they have jurisdiction only over academic violations. Failure to report a violation, while it can be construed as<br />\na violation of the Honor Code is<br />\nnot an academic violation, and<br />\nwill, for that reason, not be punishable by the H.C.<br />\nThe change in this area was<br />\napproved by the Honor Commission for the reasons stated above.<br />\nThe Honor System only works<br />\nand only makes sense if it has the<br />\nsupport of the student body. Part<br />\nof his support is turning in suspected violators. But while we<br />\ncan punish violators, we must<br />\ndistinguish between them and<br />\nnon-supporters.

BOND<br />\nUsually when a man is nominated for the presidency and<br />\nthen loses, he retires honorably<br />\nfrom political activity and becomes a pleasant household memory. But not Richard Nixon.<br />\nNearly eight years after his narrow defeat to John Kennedy,<br />\nDick Nixon is as much alive and<br />\npolitically potent as ever. Indeed,<br />\nhe is today the most boyant, if<br />\nnot the most politically astute,<br />\nmajor Republican figure since<br />\nTeddy Roosevelt.<br />\nPart of Nixon's strength is due<br />\n<br />\nto the fact that after his 1960<br />\ndeath blow he didn't die. In 1962<br />\nPat Brown killed him again, but<br />\nNixon has kept on fighting in<br />\nbehalf of Republican candidates<br />\nall over the country. From the<br />\nGarden appearance to speeches<br />\nat grange picnics, Nixon has been<br />\nthe foremost promoter of the<br />\nGOP in the '60s. As a result, he<br />\nhas become the truly faithful Republican to the party faithful.<br />\nAnd today a lot of people owe<br />\nDick Nixon quite a few favors.<br />\nIn addition, during a time<br />\nwhen U.S. foreign policy has<br />\ncrumbled at the hands of the<br />\nViet Nam war, Nixon has projected himself as the free-lance<br />\n\"internationalist\" of the GOP. To<br />\nthose who weigh foreign issues<br />\n<br />\nheavier than domestic ones,<br />\nNixon's experience in the foreign<br />\naffairs field makes him the most<br />\nwell-qualified man to occupy the<br />\nWhite House.<br />\nBut Nixon's grass-roots support<br />\nand respected image in foreign<br />\nmatters will do him little good<br />\nat the 1968 GOP convention unless he overcomes a few stigmas<br />\nin the public eye, and unless<br />\ncertain conditions prevail at<br />\nMiami Beach. First, Nixon is<br />\nstuck with a loser's image. Republicans in general have declining faith in his ability to win<br />\nan election. After all, the last<br />\nrace he won was for his California Senate seat in 1950-17<br />\nyears ago. If Nixon can't do well<br />\n<br />\nin the coming state primaries,<br />\nhis chances for nomination will<br />\nrapidly diminish. And unfortunately, the latest national polls<br />\nshow Nixon as second or third<br />\nat best in popularity among fellow GOP contenders. As Nixon<br />\nsaid himself recently: \"I have to<br />\nbe dramatically effective in the<br />\nprimaries, or I've had it.\" Second,<br />\nNixon is often rated as a conservative ,with his voter strength<br />\ncoming traditionally from conservative areas: the south and<br />\nmidwest. Yet, the current idol for<br />\nenergetic conservatives transferred from the Goldwater camp is<br />\nRonald Reagan.

Mr. Masken comes to<br />\nHopkins with impressive credentials. He ran for City College anc<br />\nco-captained a Towson State<br />\nteam.

Last<br />\nSaturday they traveled to Lancaster to face the Diplomats for<br />\nthe initial outing of the 1967<br />\ncampaign.<br />\nThe action there featured a<br />\nsuccessful on-side kickoff, ex<br />\nplosive running by backs Joe<br />\nCowan and Paul Weiss, and a<br />\nsolid Jay defensive line. Quarter<br />\nback Jim Feely commanded the<br />\noffensive squad impressively and<br />\ndisplayed potential as an accurate and effective passer. A last<br />\nminute touchdown gave the Blue<br />\nJays the win of the most exciting<br />\nfootball contest Hopkins has<br />\nplayed in recent years.<br />\nThe F&M victory, of course,<br />\ngives rise to promise for a winning season. The Jays host Ursinus tomorrow in their home<br />\nopener with much improved<br />\nchances of victory. Fullback<br />\nMark Croft, last year's leading<br />\nground gainer, was sidelined last<br />\nSaturday with a sprained arch.<br />\nThe chances for his return look<br />\nto be good. Other improvements<br />\nalso point to a favorable result in<br />\ntomorrow's contest.<br />\nIt is of course, pleasant to be<br />\nable to welcome the Class of 1971<br />\n<br />\non the encouraging note set by<br />\nlast week's victory. In this vain<br />\nI would call attention to a general increase in the quality of the<br />\nHopkins' sports program.<br />\nLast year's statistics will serve<br />\nto demonstrate an overall improvement in the won-lost tally<br />\nof most teams. Lacrosse (10-1)<br />\nsported one of its best seasons<br />\nin recent years. Fencing copped<br />\na winning season, and basketball<br />\nwas a near miss at 8-9. The<br />\nswimming team, realizing the<br />\nbenefits of the new aquatic facilities, captured its first victory in<br />\nmany seasons.<br />\nImproved schedules also witness a greater emphasis on<br />\nsports. Soccer has added the Machamps,<br />\nSouthern<br />\nson-Dixon<br />\nLynchburg. The Jay basketball<br />\nteam plays Navy (Jan. 9) for the<br />\nfirst time. The swimming and<br />\nfencing squads have both added<br />\nPenn State to their cards.<br />\nThese changes, though they<br />\nmay indicate a vibrant sports<br />\nprogram and may appear encouraging, should not be overemphasized. For the administration and<br />\nprobably the players also, sports<br />\nat Hopkins shall remain a secondary consideration in the total unIPT-Tra dna te picture.<br />\n<br />\nFreshman Basketball<br />\n<br />\nFreshman Gridders Show<br />\nTalents and Experience<br />\nIncreased experience and depth<br />\nat critical positions will be the<br />\nkeynote of the 1967 freshman<br />\nfootball campaign.<br />\nAll but five of the Baby Jays<br />\nsport high school experience. As<br />\na group ,the 32-man squad shows<br />\nmore depth than freshman teams<br />\nof past seasons.<br />\nThe quarterbacks include two<br />\nlocal men, Bob Pfeifer and Dan<br />\nAugustine, who are in contention<br />\nfor the starting assignment. The<br />\nroster also lists Dave Nolan as a<br />\nQB. Four Baby Jays are listed<br />\nfor the fullback slot. Steve Hata<br />\nlooks to be the starter, and others are Craig Moore, Ed Dunbar,<br />\nand Bob Hacher.<br />\n<br />\nThe tailbacks include Doug Pelton, Jeff Quartner ,and Dave<br />\nClark. Wingbacks are Pete Zangara, David Asken, Bob Kelley,<br />\nand Ken Dauses. The ends are<br />\nDoug Hein, Frank Bruzzese, Pete<br />\nMiller, Ed Kardas, Dwight Johnson, and Ed Kadyszewski.<br />\nContenders for the tackle assignment will be Bill Knapp.<br />\nDoug Krabbenhoft, Keven Hagan,<br />\nDan Johnson, Al Jewett, and Tim<br />\nMeiller. The probable guards are<br />\nJim McMenamin, Dennis Lanahan, Mike Foley, and Mike Teller.<br />\nFinally, the position at center<br />\nwill go to either Gus Slotman or<br />\nTom Sawyer (also a first line<br />\npotential at guard).<br />\n<br />\nR,R R Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx R x Rx Rx Rx Rx<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nce<br />\n<br />\nce<br />\nce<br />\n<br />\n\"Authorized Headquarters for<br />\nMedico-Kaywoodie-Yello-Bole<br />\nPipes\"<br />\nGREEN WAY PHARMACY<br />\nCharles And 34th St.<br />\n<br />\nWrestling<br />\n<br />\nAll Types of Subs<br />\nSnacks-Beer<br />\nOPEN TILL 1:00<br />\n7 DAYS A WEEK<br />\n<br />\nHuddle Club<br />\nTomorrow the newly-formed<br />\nHopkins Huddle Club, an organization of Hopkins alumni<br />\nInterested in J.H.U. athletics,<br />\nespecially football, will hold a<br />\n\"Kickoff\" luncheon to inaugurate the Hopkins home athletic season<br />\n<br />\nB& M SUB SHOP<br />\n31st & GUILFORD<br />\n<br />\nJOHN P.

With experienced performers available at<br />\nmost key positions, they should<br />\nprovide rougher opposition than<br />\nthe above comparative scores<br />\nwould tend to indicate.<br />\nUrsinus quarterback Pete D'Achille, a 6-0 senior who hit on<br />\nseven of seventeen passes (one<br />\nfor a 55 yard T.D.) against Hopkins in 466, can throw well both<br />\nlong and short; and he has an<br />\nexcellent target in the person of<br />\n5-8, 155 pound soph backfield<br />\nmate Joe Corvaia, also a capable<br />\nrunner (77 yards on 16 carries<br />\nagainst Muhlenberg). Rounding<br />\nout the Bear backfield are 5-8,<br />\n155 pound soph halfback Greg<br />\nAdams\u2014a capable runner and receiver\u2014 and junior fullback Jim<br />\nMcDonald (44 yards on seven carries last week).<br />\nLeading the way for this unit<br />\nis a veteran offensive line which<br />\naverages 194 pounds per man and<br />\n<br />\npossesses two more capable receivers for D'Achille's tosses in<br />\n6-1, 180 pound split end John<br />\nTracey and 6-1, 185 pound Tom<br />\nAddicks. The defense, which allowed Muhlenberg only one score<br />\n(as compared to at least two<br />\nT.D.'s against Hopkins), should<br />\nalso be fairly effective.<br />\nJ.H.U. football took one of its<br />\nrosier hues of recent years last<br />\nSaturday, when the Jay contingent\u2014displaying the makings of<br />\na potent offense and getting effective defensive performances from<br />\nseveral newcomers\u2014staged a 1914 comeback win over Franklin<br />\nand Marshall.<br />\nCowan Rambles<br />\nJunior Joe Cowan, three years<br />\nabsent from the grid wars, made<br />\nhis presence felt in a hurry in<br />\nthat game, as he took a handoff<br />\nfrom Paul Weiss on the opening<br />\nkickoff and moved 88 yards to<br />\nstake his teammates to a 6-0 lead.<br />\nHopkins, twice driving inside the<br />\nF&M 20 yard line but failing to<br />\nscore, dominated the entire first<br />\nperiod; and it was not until the<br />\nend of the half that the Diplomats, after a 50 yard drive, got<br />\nthe score that put them ahead<br />\n7-6.<br />\nThe offensive impetus went<br />\nback to the Homewood squad in<br />\nthe third period, as two stalled<br />\ndrives resulted in field goals of<br />\n38 (line of scrimmage 21) and<br />\n<br />\nIliossamisassamikoalaftsassoftsessoftessauloaassamossoa.%001<br />\n<br />\nBy BOB HYAMS<br />\nThe varsity soccer team kicks<br />\noff the season this year against<br />\nDelaware on Tuesday, October 8,<br />\nat 3 p.m. with chances of a winning season hinging on the contributions of sophomores.<br />\nIf the sophomores do their job<br />\nin every ball game, the Jays have<br />\na good chance to come out number one. Coach Barrette opined,<br />\n\"the team has good talent, great<br />\nspirit, but experience looks to be<br />\na big factor.\" Foreign players,<br />\nespecially on Swarthmore and<br />\nDrexel have a lot more experience<br />\nthan the Jays and everything is<br />\nput squarely on the sophomores'<br />\nshoulders.<br />\nStarters Cited<br />\nThe team consists of nine<br />\nsophomores, eight juniors, and<br />\nfive seniors, with eleven returning lettermen. Starting linemen<br />\nare co-captain Wes Bachur, Kit<br />\nBattenfield, Art Guerin, and Lou<br />\nSardella. The starting backs are<br />\nco-captain John Sarney, John<br />\nClisham, Randy Miller, Roger<br />\nPurdon, Dave Rockwell, and Rick<br />\nTobey. The goalie position is still<br />\nin doubt as Mike Avery has a bad<br />\nankle. He will probably alternate<br />\nwith Pete Martindale.<br />\nThe graduation of Pablo Drob<br />\nny means a big scoring loss and<br />\nalso a defensive loss as the defense was formerly stacked up on<br />\nhim. However, if the sophs do<br />\ntheir job, things look very bright<br />\nas the team is more diversified<br />\nthan ever before. The halfback<br />\nslot is a crucial spot and sophs<br />\nRandy Miller and Rick Tobey are<br />\ngood prospects. Dave Roberts<br />\nand Josh Gerberer are the first<br />\nline replacements and the first<br />\nback substitute is Ken Torrington. Chris Gordon is lost for the<br />\nseason due to illness.<br />\n<br />\n(approximately) 25 yards by<br />\nformer soccer standout We:.<br />\nBachur. F&M, however, capitalized on a pass interception and<br />\nmoved to a forth period score<br />\nthat brought the count to 14-12.<br />\nHopkins then took off on a<br />\nlong drive led and ended by soph<br />\nhalfback Weiss, who fumbled inside the Diplomat ten yard line<br />\nwith about five minutes left. The<br />\nJay defense then rose to the occasion, forcing an F&M punt<br />\nthat gave the Homewood squad<br />\nthe ball on its own 49 with about<br />\ntwo-and-a-half minutes left and<br />\nsetting the stage for the Jim<br />\ndrive<br />\nthat<br />\nFeely-engineered<br />\nearned for the 5-8 signal-caller<br />\ndesignation by J.H.U. coaches as<br />\nthe top Hop back of the game.<br />\nThe junior quarterback first<br />\npassed to Cowan for fifteen<br />\nyards, sent Weiss into the line for<br />\nthree, and again hit Cowan, this<br />\ntime on a swing pass which carried to the fifteen.

Students, according to<br />\nthe good Dean, should keep their noses out of such<br />\nmatters as institutional finances and mind their own<br />\nbusiness.<br />\nThis unfortunate expression of the subconscious<br />\nreaffirms our view that the student is only an incidental guest at Hopkins. It would be wise to remember<br />\nthat an administration is only a glorified janitor, making sure all the parts are running to the satisfaction of<br />\nthe scholars and students.<br />\nThere is a phenomenon in social theory that explains the syndrome of the Hopkins administration. It<br />\nseems that organizations are created to reach goals.<br />\nWhen they lose sight of their goal, or become sidetracked, the organization often works only to perpetuate itself. Apparently this is what has happened to the<br />\nHopkins administration\u2014a situation whereby both student and scholar are seriously threatened.<br />\nWe humble students have entrusted this institution<br />\nvilith the responsibility to educate us, and it seems that<br />\nat a crisp $2,000 per annum the administration could<br />\naccommodate us. Instead, at every corner we see blunder<br />\nafter blunder. And when we ask why, we are told it is<br />\nnot our business. What goes on behind the green door?<br />\nFor instance, why does Whitehead Hall and Plant<br />\nManager Wesley Taylor siphon off $240 from the food<br />\nallowance of subscribers to the Kosher Dining Hall?<br />\n\"For overhead\" we are told. What overhead? The students are paying for everything in this project.<br />\nThe language departments are screaming about not<br />\nenough funds to allow efficient operation of the new<br />\nlanguage lab. Apparently money had been cut off the<br />\nbudget. Can we see the figures? Dean Kimball feels our<br />\ninterests should lie elsewhere. A large water main (not<br />\nserviced since 1921) breaks in the upper-class dormitories, making bathrooms unusable for a day.<br />\nAnd perhaps worst of all the famous 7c Levering<br />\ncoffee now costs 10c. \"I guess it's another of Taylor's<br />\nthings,\" shrugs the counter woman.<br />\nIn the academic realm, where student opinion seldom ventures, there is the strange case of the vanishing<br />\npass-fail option.

Lincoln Gordon,<br />\nwhether he turns out to be a<br />\nliberal administrator or a repressive one, is going to try to insure that Hopkins remains a safe<br />\nplace for the services to government and industry that seem to<br />\nbe its raison d'etre. He and his<br />\ncolleagues are going to oppose<br />\nany serious efforts made, by<br />\n\"direct action\" or otherwise, to<br />\ndemocratize the university, to<br />\nchange its orientation or to force<br />\nit to come to terms with the<br />\nsociety around it.

It<br />\ndoes not, however, attempt to<br />\nprevent cheating in any active<br />\nsense, except, perhaps, insofar as<br />\nit orients newcomers in our community. he prevention of cheating is a matter of individual concern, to be decided by each member of this community in accordance with his own attitudes and<br />\ninclinations.<br /><br />\nPart of one's responsibility under the Honor Code is to report<br />\nsuspected violators. This responsibility, however, is not on4<br />\nwhich the Honor Commission<br />\ncan enforce. Nor is it one which<br />\nshould be enforced by the Honor<br />\nCommission, for they have jurisdiction only over academic violations. Failure to report a violation, while it can be construed as<br />\na violation of the Honor Code is<br />\nnot an academic violation, and<br />\nwill, for that reason, not be punishable by the H.C.<br />\nThe change in this area was<br />\napproved by the Honor Commission for the reasons stated above.<br />\nThe Honor System only works<br />\nand only makes sense if it has the<br />\nsupport of the student body.

Mr. Masken comes to<br />\nHopkins with impressive credentials. He ran for City College anc<br />\nco-captained a Towson State<br />\nteam. Following graduation he<br />\nheaded the Chesapeake Track<br />\nClub and served as chairman of<br />\nthe South Atlantic Track Association.<br />\nWhen asked of his team's prospects ,the youthful coach snapped, \"great.\" Training consists of<br />\nten miles a day in preparation<br />\nfor the grueling four mile race.<br />\nFortunately the new coach has a<br />\nroster of dedicated athletes in an<br />\nunheralded sport.<br />\nSeniors Cliff Cyr and Jerry Danoff are co-captains. The other returning lettermen are Jeff Lauren<br />\nand John Gardinger. Yet to run<br />\nin varsity competition are sophomores John McKeon and John<br />\nWilkens. Hopefully this promising team will take its share of<br />\nvictories during the eight-meet<br />\n1967 season.<br /><br />\nVarsity Basketball<br />\nVarsity basketball practice<br />\nwill start on Tuesday, October<br />\n17.

Last<br />\nSaturday they traveled to Lancaster to face the Diplomats for<br />\nthe initial outing of the 1967<br />\ncampaign.<br />\nThe action there featured a<br />\nsuccessful on-side kickoff, ex<br />\nplosive running by backs Joe<br />\nCowan and Paul Weiss, and a<br />\nsolid Jay defensive line. Quarter<br />\nback Jim Feely commanded the<br />\noffensive squad impressively and<br />\ndisplayed potential as an accurate and effective passer. A last<br />\nminute touchdown gave the Blue<br />\nJays the win of the most exciting<br />\nfootball contest Hopkins has<br />\nplayed in recent years.<br />\nThe F&amp;M victory, of course,<br />\ngives rise to promise for a winning season. The Jays host Ursinus tomorrow in their home<br />\nopener with much improved<br />\nchances of victory. Fullback<br />\nMark Croft, last year's leading<br />\nground gainer, was sidelined last<br />\nSaturday with a sprained arch.<br />\nThe chances for his return look<br />\nto be good. Other improvements<br />\nalso point to a favorable result in<br />\ntomorrow's contest.<br />\nIt is of course, pleasant to be<br />\nable to welcome the Class of 1971<br /><br />\non the encouraging note set by<br />\nlast week's victory. In this vain<br />\nI would call attention to a general increase in the quality of the<br />\nHopkins' sports program.<br />\nLast year's statistics will serve<br />\nto demonstrate an overall improvement in the won-lost tally<br />\nof most teams. Lacrosse (10-1)<br />\nsported one of its best seasons<br />\nin recent years. Fencing copped<br />\na winning season, and basketball<br />\nwas a near miss at 8-9. The<br />\nswimming team, realizing the<br />\nbenefits of the new aquatic facilities, captured its first victory in<br />\nmany seasons.<br />\nImproved schedules also witness a greater emphasis on<br />\nsports. Soccer has added the Machamps,<br />\nSouthern<br />\nson-Dixon<br />\nLynchburg. The Jay basketball<br />\nteam plays Navy (Jan. 9) for the<br />\nfirst time. The swimming and<br />\nfencing squads have both added<br />\nPenn State to their cards.<br />\nThese changes, though they<br />\nmay indicate a vibrant sports<br />\nprogram and may appear encouraging, should not be overemphasized. For the administration and<br />\nprobably the players also, sports<br />\nat Hopkins shall remain a secondary consideration in the total unIPT-Tra dna te picture.<br /><br />\nFreshman Basketball<br /><br />\nFreshman Gridders Show<br />\nTalents and Experience<br />\nIncreased experience and depth<br />\nat critical positions will be the<br />\nkeynote of the 1967 freshman<br />\nfootball campaign.<br />\nAll but five of the Baby Jays<br />\nsport high school experience. As<br />\na group ,the 32-man squad shows<br />\nmore depth than freshman teams<br />\nof past seasons.<br />\nThe quarterbacks include two<br />\nlocal men, Bob Pfeifer and Dan<br />\nAugustine, who are in contention<br />\nfor the starting assignment. The<br />\nroster also lists Dave Nolan as a<br />\nQB. Four Baby Jays are listed<br />\nfor the fullback slot. Steve Hata<br />\nlooks to be the starter, and others are Craig Moore, Ed Dunbar,<br />\nand Bob Hacher.<br /><br />\nThe tailbacks include Doug Pelton, Jeff Quartner ,and Dave<br />\nClark. Wingbacks are Pete Zangara, David Asken, Bob Kelley,<br />\nand Ken Dauses. The ends are<br />\nDoug Hein, Frank Bruzzese, Pete<br />\nMiller, Ed Kardas, Dwight Johnson, and Ed Kadyszewski.<br />\nContenders for the tackle assignment will be Bill Knapp.<br />\nDoug Krabbenhoft, Keven Hagan,<br />\nDan Johnson, Al Jewett, and Tim<br />\nMeiller. The probable guards are<br />\nJim McMenamin, Dennis Lanahan, Mike Foley, and Mike Teller.<br />\nFinally, the position at center<br />\nwill go to either Gus Slotman or<br />\nTom Sawyer (also a first line<br />\npotential at guard).<br /><br />\nR,R R Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx R x Rx Rx Rx Rx<br />\nX<br /><br />\nce<br /><br />\nce<br />\nce<br /><br />\n\"Authorized Headquarters for<br />\nMedico-Kaywoodie-Yello-Bole<br />\nPipes\"<br />\nGREEN WAY PHARMACY<br />\nCharles And 34th St.<br /><br />\nWrestling<br /><br />\nAll Types of Subs<br />\nSnacks-Beer<br />\nOPEN TILL 1:00<br />\n7 DAYS A WEEK<br /><br />\nHuddle Club<br />\nTomorrow the newly-formed<br />\nHopkins Huddle Club, an organization of Hopkins alumni<br />\nInterested in J.H.U. athletics,<br />\nespecially football, will hold a<br />\n\"Kickoff\" luncheon to inaugurate the Hopkins home athletic season<br /><br />\nB&amp; M SUB SHOP<br />\n31st &amp; GUILFORD<br /><br />\nJOHN P.

With experienced performers available at<br />\nmost key positions, they should<br />\nprovide rougher opposition than<br />\nthe above comparative scores<br />\nwould tend to indicate.<br />\nUrsinus quarterback Pete D'Achille, a 6-0 senior who hit on<br />\nseven of seventeen passes (one<br />\nfor a 55 yard T.D.) against Hopkins in 466, can throw well both<br />\nlong and short; and he has an<br />\nexcellent target in the person of<br />\n5-8, 155 pound soph backfield<br />\nmate Joe Corvaia, also a capable<br />\nrunner (77 yards on 16 carries<br />\nagainst Muhlenberg). Rounding<br />\nout the Bear backfield are 5-8,<br />\n155 pound soph halfback Greg<br />\nAdams\u2014a capable runner and receiver\u2014 and junior fullback Jim<br />\nMcDonald (44 yards on seven carries last week).<br />\nLeading the way for this unit<br />\nis a veteran offensive line which<br />\naverages 194 pounds per man and<br /><br />\npossesses two more capable receivers for D'Achille's tosses in<br />\n6-1, 180 pound split end John<br />\nTracey and 6-1, 185 pound Tom<br />\nAddicks. The defense, which allowed Muhlenberg only one score<br />\n(as compared to at least two<br />\nT.D.'s against Hopkins), should<br />\nalso be fairly effective.<br />\nJ.H.U. football took one of its<br />\nrosier hues of recent years last<br />\nSaturday, when the Jay contingent\u2014displaying the makings of<br />\na potent offense and getting effective defensive performances from<br />\nseveral newcomers\u2014staged a 1914 comeback win over Franklin<br />\nand Marshall.<br />\nCowan Rambles<br />\nJunior Joe Cowan, three years<br />\nabsent from the grid wars, made<br />\nhis presence felt in a hurry in<br />\nthat game, as he took a handoff<br />\nfrom Paul Weiss on the opening<br />\nkickoff and moved 88 yards to<br />\nstake his teammates to a 6-0 lead.<br />\nHopkins, twice driving inside the<br />\nF&amp;M 20 yard line but failing to<br />\nscore, dominated the entire first<br />\nperiod; and it was not until the<br />\nend of the half that the Diplomats, after a 50 yard drive, got<br />\nthe score that put them ahead<br />\n7-6.<br />\nThe offensive impetus went<br />\nback to the Homewood squad in<br />\nthe third period, as two stalled<br />\ndrives resulted in field goals of<br />\n38 (line of scrimmage 21) and<br /><br />\nIliossamisassamikoalaftsassoftsessoftessauloaassamossoa.%001<br /><br />\nBy BOB HYAMS<br />\nThe varsity soccer team kicks<br />\noff the season this year against<br />\nDelaware on Tuesday, October 8,<br />\nat 3 p.m. with chances of a winning season hinging on the contributions of sophomores.<br />\nIf the sophomores do their job<br />\nin every ball game, the Jays have<br />\na good chance to come out number one. Coach Barrette opined,<br />\n\"the team has good talent, great<br />\nspirit, but experience looks to be<br />\na big factor.\" Foreign players,<br />\nespecially on Swarthmore and<br />\nDrexel have a lot more experience<br />\nthan the Jays and everything is<br />\nput squarely on the sophomores'<br />\nshoulders.<br />\nStarters Cited<br />\nThe team consists of nine<br />\nsophomores, eight juniors, and<br />\nfive seniors, with eleven returning lettermen. Starting linemen<br />\nare co-captain Wes Bachur, Kit<br />\nBattenfield, Art Guerin, and Lou<br />\nSardella. The starting backs are<br />\nco-captain John Sarney, John<br />\nClisham, Randy Miller, Roger<br />\nPurdon, Dave Rockwell, and Rick<br />\nTobey. The goalie position is still<br />\nin doubt as Mike Avery has a bad<br />\nankle. He will probably alternate<br />\nwith Pete Martindale.<br />\nThe graduation of Pablo Drob<br />\nny means a big scoring loss and<br />\nalso a defensive loss as the defense was formerly stacked up on<br />\nhim. However, if the sophs do<br />\ntheir job, things look very bright<br />\nas the team is more diversified<br />\nthan ever before. The halfback<br />\nslot is a crucial spot and sophs<br />\nRandy Miller and Rick Tobey are<br />\ngood prospects. Dave Roberts<br />\nand Josh Gerberer are the first<br />\nline replacements and the first<br />\nback substitute is Ken Torrington. Chris Gordon is lost for the<br />\nseason due to illness.<br /><br />\n(approximately) 25 yards by<br />\nformer soccer standout We:.<br />\nBachur. F&amp;M, however, capitalized on a pass interception and<br />\nmoved to a forth period score<br />\nthat brought the count to 14-12.<br />\nHopkins then took off on a<br />\nlong drive led and ended by soph<br />\nhalfback Weiss, who fumbled inside the Diplomat ten yard line<br />\nwith about five minutes left. The<br />\nJay defense then rose to the occasion, forcing an F&amp;M punt<br />\nthat gave the Homewood squad<br />\nthe ball on its own 49 with about<br />\ntwo-and-a-half minutes left and<br />\nsetting the stage for the Jim<br />\ndrive<br />\nthat<br />\nFeely-engineered<br />\nearned for the 5-8 signal-caller<br />\ndesignation by J.H.U. coaches as<br />\nthe top Hop back of the game.<br />\nThe junior quarterback first<br />\npassed to Cowan for fifteen<br />\nyards, sent Weiss into the line for<br />\nthree, and again hit Cowan, this<br />\ntime on a swing pass which carried to the fifteen.
