Unlike<br />\nthe NIH, this agency does not<br />\nseparate indirect cost charges<br />\nfrom the direct costs of the<br />\nresearch effort.<br />\nLong term projects which were<br />\nplanned under the former<br />\noverhead charges may be forced<br />\nto use the money once<br />\ndesignated for salaries and<br />\nsupplies to cover this increased<br />\nexpense.<br />\nDr. John Cebra, Biology,<br />\nexplained, \"I thought that the<br />\nincreased charges were justified,<br />\nbut it should only be imposed on<br />\n<br />\na NSF grant at the time of its<br />\nnegotiation. If the increase is<br />\nlevied afterward, it dips into the<br />\ndirect costs of the project. The<br />\nonly way out of this is to forfeit<br />\nthe grant and reapply. At this<br />\ntime approval rates are very bad<br />\nand you could lose your whole<br />\nproject.\"<br />\nHoratio Proctor, Office of<br />\nSponsored Research, said that if<br />\nsomeone is granted money at one<br />\nrate, the University is bound by<br />\nthat rate and cannot increase it<br />\nuntil he reapplies.<br />\nCebra pointed out, however,<br />\nthat many projects must submit<br />\nbudgets each year for approval<br />\nand receive an allotmeni that was<br />\nfixed when the aim of the<br />\ninvestigation was first delineated<br />\nand the grant awarded. These<br />\nprojects will be subject to the<br />\nhigher rate even though the funds<br />\nprovided each year will not<br />\nchange.<br />\n\"If operating funds are cut<br />\nbelow a certain level in order to<br />\ncover this added expense,<br />\nresearchers may have to cut back<br />\non their goals. I will probably<br />\nhave to do this with my project,\"<br />\nCebra admitted.<br />\n\"By placing this high rate on<br />\nfixed income grants people will<br />\nmove to the more health-related<br />\nareas of research which are<br />\nsupported by NIH funds,\" he<br />\ncontinued.<br />\n\"NSF grants focus more on<br />\n<br />\nbasic research.

Research projects already well underway will have<br />\nto face the unpleasant prospect of reallocating their research<br />\ngrants so that money once used for staff salaries and supplies<br />\ncan be used to defray the cost of the increased tax.<br />\nThough an increase in the University's tax on research<br />\nfunds may be desirable\u2014if not necessary\u2014from an<br />\nadministrative standpoint, we consider it grossly unfair that<br />\nincreased charges should be imposed on a federal grant<br />\nsubsequent to it negotiation.

This fact has been<br />\nacknowledged and developed by all<br />\nthe disciplines of life, including<br />\npsychology, biology, medicine,law<br />\nand Madison Avenue. It is<br />\nfundamental component of an<br />\nindividual's identity and until a<br />\nperson has resolved the issues<br />\nsurrounding one's own self-concept<br />\nhe/she is unable to resolve the<br />\nissues of his/her environment.<br />\nThus, it seems that a symposium<br />\non a topic of such UBIQUITOUS<br />\nconcern would be of great interest<br />\nto universi ty students, who, by<br />\ndefinition, are seeking to better<br />\nunderstand the prolllems facing<br />\ntheir world and develop the<br />\ncapacity to cope with these<br />\nproblems. Poor attendance at such<br />\na symposium would seem to<br />\nindicate a previous education and<br />\nunderstanding of the topic being<br />\ndiscussed. It would, indeed, be a<br />\npositive statement about the<br />\nHopkins community to say that<br />\nthe poor attendance at this year's<br />\nSymposium could be justified by a<br />\nprior sophistication in dealing with<br />\nthe issues of sexuality. Examining<br />\nthe actual actions and attitudes<br />\nprevalent at Hopkins, however,<br />\nprecludes a consideration of this<br />\njustification. The Hopkins faculty,<br />\na major factor in determining the<br />\nidentity of a university, contains a<br />\n<br />\nminute proportion of women<br />\nmembers with no impetus for<br />\nincreased recruitment in the future<br />\nand unending flow of<br />\nundocumented reports of<br />\nincompetency at the GYN Clinic<br />\nremain unexplored, homosexual<br />\nmembers of the community remain<br />\n\"in the closet\" because they (and<br />\ncommunity members) would<br />\nrather ignore the issue that accept<br />\nit as a part of their identity or as a<br />\nproblem, and the Women's Center<br />\n51<br />\nP-4>M\"'-,71.<br />\n<br />\ntimes.

It co.re<br />\nthat these problems remain,<br />\nuntreated, even after a thorough<br />\nexposure in this year's Symposium<br />\nto the idea, suggestions and facts<br />\nproffered by experts in the field.<br />\nAmazing, also, is the fact that<br />\nmisnomers such as \"which for<br />\nbetter or worse, one outgrows\"<br />\n(Dick Walker referring to sex) or<br />\nthat sexuality is neither<br />\neducationally nor nationally<br />\nsignificant can be repeated in spite<br />\nof all attempts on the part of the<br />\nSymposium to eliminate this<br />\nspecies of ignorance.<br />\nI agree with Mr. Walker that one<br />\neffective method of determining<br />\nthe future direction of Symposium<br />\ntopics is to re-evaluate those of the<br />\npast. In evaluating<br />\na t opic's<br />\npotential for success or failure, it is<br />\nalso necessary to evaluate the<br />\ncapacity of the university<br />\ncommunity to be educated by the<br />\nopinions offered on a chosen topic.<br />\nThis capacity involves a willingness<br />\ntowards exposure to new ideas and<br />\nthe committment to explore the<br />\nissues and resolutions of these<br />\nideas rather than the selective use<br />\nof a Symposium to reinforce prior<br />\nattitudes. This selective use is<br />\ndisappointingly clear<br />\nin Mr.<br />\nWalker's labeling of the<br />\nSymposium on Human Sexuality<br />\nas \"a cheaper way of seeing porno<br />\nflicks than going to the Rex<br />\ntheatre, but it hardly ranked as a<br />\ngreat educational experience.\"<br />\nSelection of a Symposium topic is<br />\none opportunity offered to the<br />\nstudents (and revoked by the SC<br />\nSelections Committee??) to<br />\ndetermine the character of the<br />\neducation they wish to receive at<br />\nHopkins. Not only does it involve a<br />\nresponsibility in selecting a topic<br />\nwhich needs to be confronted and<br />\ndiscussed, but the reponsibility of<br />\ncommittment.

D. CONSIDINE<br />\nWhen dealing with a film such as<br />\nKen Russell's Tommy, criticism is<br />\nvery difficult. Tommy falls into<br />\nthe category of pop-art, and<br />\nsubsequently the critics are divided<br />\ninto two camps: the art camp<br />\nwhich goes out of its way to<br />\nbrutally attack the work, and the<br />\npop camp which borders on<br />\nmindless idolatry.<br />\nThe key to the film is to<br />\nremember that Tommy is pop-art,<br />\nand should be judged on that basis,<br />\non the ground of what it sets out<br />\nto do. And on those grounds it<br />\nworks very well; Tommy is<br />\nentertainment, but not mindlessly<br />\nso. It is a balanced combination of<br />\npop and culture, Joe Everyman's<br />\ncliches garbed in an artistic<br />\nthreepiece suit.<br />\nAs art, it has all the right ideas,<br />\nbut uses them with the subtlety of<br />\na promoter's hype job. In a way, it<br />\nis a hype job-the use of colour to<br />\nrepresent ideas (greencoats at a<br />\nholiday camp become the garb of<br />\nTommy's disciples), the heavy<br />\nhanded Christian imagery (when<br />\nTommy ran by a group of<br />\n<br />\nfishermen hauling in their nets I<br />\nnearly broke up), and the \"deft<br />\njabs\" of irony all scream their<br />\nsignificance at volume levels<br />\nbeyond that of the sound track.<br />\nRussell could have just as well lanel<br />\nthe characters with signs reading<br />\n\"Christ Image\", \"Oedipal Father<br />\nFigure\" and so on.<br />\nBut on the other hand, about<br />\nhalfway through the film, it<br />\nbecomes apparent that the Film<br />\ndoesn't take itself too seriously.<br />\nRussell no doubt realizes that<br />\nTommy is not pretentious enough<br />\nto be made int9 Fellini, and also<br />\nthat the people who see Fellini are<br />\nfor the most part too pretentious<br />\nthemselves to be even interested in<br />\nthe Who's music. Peter Townsend<br />\nsaid \"As a gag, when we were<br />\nworking on Tommy, we started to<br />\ncall it a rock opera, knowing full<br />\nwell it wasn't a true opera at all.\"<br />\nThe film works the same way.<br />\nAs pop, Tommy is better than<br />\never.

Unlike<br />\nthe NIH, this agency does not<br />\nseparate indirect cost charges<br />\nfrom the direct costs of the<br />\nresearch effort.<br />\nLong term projects which were<br />\nplanned under the former<br />\noverhead charges may be forced<br />\nto use the money once<br />\ndesignated for salaries and<br />\nsupplies to cover this increased<br />\nexpense.<br />\nDr. John Cebra, Biology,<br />\nexplained, \"I thought that the<br />\nincreased charges were justified,<br />\nbut it should only be imposed on<br /><br />\na NSF grant at the time of its<br />\nnegotiation. If the increase is<br />\nlevied afterward, it dips into the<br />\ndirect costs of the project. The<br />\nonly way out of this is to forfeit<br />\nthe grant and reapply. At this<br />\ntime approval rates are very bad<br />\nand you could lose your whole<br />\nproject.\"<br />\nHoratio Proctor, Office of<br />\nSponsored Research, said that if<br />\nsomeone is granted money at one<br />\nrate, the University is bound by<br />\nthat rate and cannot increase it<br />\nuntil he reapplies.<br />\nCebra pointed out, however,<br />\nthat many projects must submit<br />\nbudgets each year for approval<br />\nand receive an allotmeni that was<br />\nfixed when the aim of the<br />\ninvestigation was first delineated<br />\nand the grant awarded. These<br />\nprojects will be subject to the<br />\nhigher rate even though the funds<br />\nprovided each year will not<br />\nchange.<br />\n\"If operating funds are cut<br />\nbelow a certain level in order to<br />\ncover this added expense,<br />\nresearchers may have to cut back<br />\non their goals. I will probably<br />\nhave to do this with my project,\"<br />\nCebra admitted.<br />\n\"By placing this high rate on<br />\nfixed income grants people will<br />\nmove to the more health-related<br />\nareas of research which are<br />\nsupported by NIH funds,\" he<br />\ncontinued.<br />\n\"NSF grants focus more on<br /><br />\nbasic research. Since there is an<br />\nupper limit on funds, cutting into<br />\nthem will make it difficult to<br />\nundertake many projects.\"<br />\nDr. Michael Edidin, Biology,<br />\nexpressed concern over the<br />\nincrease though he said his own<br />\nprojects will not suffer because<br />\nhis only NSF grant is coming up<br />\nfor renegotiation.<br />\n\"The people hit the hardest<br />\nwill be the best research groups<br /><br />\nDidi Krausz for president.<br />\nMary Beth Fasono, Susan<br />\nKahan, Michael Nowothy, Barry<br />\nRosenthal, and Charles Rowan<br />\nare running for next year's<br />\nsophomore class vice president.<br />\nSue Matesic, the only<br />\ncandidate for sophomore<br />\nsecretary, was declared the<br />\nwinner.

Research projects already well underway will have<br />\nto face the unpleasant prospect of reallocating their research<br />\ngrants so that money once used for staff salaries and supplies<br />\ncan be used to defray the cost of the increased tax.<br />\nThough an increase in the University's tax on research<br />\nfunds may be desirable\u2014if not necessary\u2014from an<br />\nadministrative standpoint, we consider it grossly unfair that<br />\nincreased charges should be imposed on a federal grant<br />\nsubsequent to it negotiation.

This fact has been<br />\nacknowledged and developed by all<br />\nthe disciplines of life, including<br />\npsychology, biology, medicine,law<br />\nand Madison Avenue. It is<br />\nfundamental component of an<br />\nindividual's identity and until a<br />\nperson has resolved the issues<br />\nsurrounding one's own self-concept<br />\nhe/she is unable to resolve the<br />\nissues of his/her environment.<br />\nThus, it seems that a symposium<br />\non a topic of such UBIQUITOUS<br />\nconcern would be of great interest<br />\nto universi ty students, who, by<br />\ndefinition, are seeking to better<br />\nunderstand the prolllems facing<br />\ntheir world and develop the<br />\ncapacity to cope with these<br />\nproblems. Poor attendance at such<br />\na symposium would seem to<br />\nindicate a previous education and<br />\nunderstanding of the topic being<br />\ndiscussed. It would, indeed, be a<br />\npositive statement about the<br />\nHopkins community to say that<br />\nthe poor attendance at this year's<br />\nSymposium could be justified by a<br />\nprior sophistication in dealing with<br />\nthe issues of sexuality. Examining<br />\nthe actual actions and attitudes<br />\nprevalent at Hopkins, however,<br />\nprecludes a consideration of this<br />\njustification. The Hopkins faculty,<br />\na major factor in determining the<br />\nidentity of a university, contains a<br /><br />\nminute proportion of women<br />\nmembers with no impetus for<br />\nincreased recruitment in the future<br />\nand unending flow of<br />\nundocumented reports of<br />\nincompetency at the GYN Clinic<br />\nremain unexplored, homosexual<br />\nmembers of the community remain<br />\n\"in the closet\" because they (and<br />\ncommunity members) would<br />\nrather ignore the issue that accept<br />\nit as a part of their identity or as a<br />\nproblem, and the Women's Center<br />\n51<br />\nP-4&gt;M\"'-,71.<br /><br />\ntimes.

It co.re<br />\nthat these problems remain,<br />\nuntreated, even after a thorough<br />\nexposure in this year's Symposium<br />\nto the idea, suggestions and facts<br />\nproffered by experts in the field.<br />\nAmazing, also, is the fact that<br />\nmisnomers such as \"which for<br />\nbetter or worse, one outgrows\"<br />\n(Dick Walker referring to sex) or<br />\nthat sexuality is neither<br />\neducationally nor nationally<br />\nsignificant can be repeated in spite<br />\nof all attempts on the part of the<br />\nSymposium to eliminate this<br />\nspecies of ignorance.<br />\nI agree with Mr. Walker that one<br />\neffective method of determining<br />\nthe future direction of Symposium<br />\ntopics is to re-evaluate those of the<br />\npast. In evaluating<br />\na t opic's<br />\npotential for success or failure, it is<br />\nalso necessary to evaluate the<br />\ncapacity of the university<br />\ncommunity to be educated by the<br />\nopinions offered on a chosen topic.<br />\nThis capacity involves a willingness<br />\ntowards exposure to new ideas and<br />\nthe committment to explore the<br />\nissues and resolutions of these<br />\nideas rather than the selective use<br />\nof a Symposium to reinforce prior<br />\nattitudes. This selective use is<br />\ndisappointingly clear<br />\nin Mr.<br />\nWalker's labeling of the<br />\nSymposium on Human Sexuality<br />\nas \"a cheaper way of seeing porno<br />\nflicks than going to the Rex<br />\ntheatre, but it hardly ranked as a<br />\ngreat educational experience.\"<br />\nSelection of a Symposium topic is<br />\none opportunity offered to the<br />\nstudents (and revoked by the SC<br />\nSelections Committee??) to<br />\ndetermine the character of the<br />\neducation they wish to receive at<br />\nHopkins. Not only does it involve a<br />\nresponsibility in selecting a topic<br />\nwhich needs to be confronted and<br />\ndiscussed, but the reponsibility of<br />\ncommittment.

D. CONSIDINE<br />\nWhen dealing with a film such as<br />\nKen Russell's Tommy, criticism is<br />\nvery difficult. Tommy falls into<br />\nthe category of pop-art, and<br />\nsubsequently the critics are divided<br />\ninto two camps: the art camp<br />\nwhich goes out of its way to<br />\nbrutally attack the work, and the<br />\npop camp which borders on<br />\nmindless idolatry.<br />\nThe key to the film is to<br />\nremember that Tommy is pop-art,<br />\nand should be judged on that basis,<br />\non the ground of what it sets out<br />\nto do. And on those grounds it<br />\nworks very well; Tommy is<br />\nentertainment, but not mindlessly<br />\nso. It is a balanced combination of<br />\npop and culture, Joe Everyman's<br />\ncliches garbed in an artistic<br />\nthreepiece suit.<br />\nAs art, it has all the right ideas,<br />\nbut uses them with the subtlety of<br />\na promoter's hype job. In a way, it<br />\nis a hype job-the use of colour to<br />\nrepresent ideas (greencoats at a<br />\nholiday camp become the garb of<br />\nTommy's disciples), the heavy<br />\nhanded Christian imagery (when<br />\nTommy ran by a group of<br /><br />\nfishermen hauling in their nets I<br />\nnearly broke up), and the \"deft<br />\njabs\" of irony all scream their<br />\nsignificance at volume levels<br />\nbeyond that of the sound track.<br />\nRussell could have just as well lanel<br />\nthe characters with signs reading<br />\n\"Christ Image\", \"Oedipal Father<br />\nFigure\" and so on.<br />\nBut on the other hand, about<br />\nhalfway through the film, it<br />\nbecomes apparent that the Film<br />\ndoesn't take itself too seriously.<br />\nRussell no doubt realizes that<br />\nTommy is not pretentious enough<br />\nto be made int9 Fellini, and also<br />\nthat the people who see Fellini are<br />\nfor the most part too pretentious<br />\nthemselves to be even interested in<br />\nthe Who's music. Peter Townsend<br />\nsaid \"As a gag, when we were<br />\nworking on Tommy, we started to<br />\ncall it a rock opera, knowing full<br />\nwell it wasn't a true opera at all.\"<br />\nThe film works the same way.<br />\nAs pop, Tommy is better than<br />\never.
