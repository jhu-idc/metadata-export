They do a good deal of didactive work and have a vast amount<br />\nof academic promise. They have not<br />\nas yet the reputation that gives a<br />\nman his choice of positions so that<br />\nthe chances of their securing places<br />\nelsewhere are slim.<br />\nIf these men are dropped, their<br />\nwork will have to be taken over by<br />\nthe surviving members of the faculty<br />\n--those men who are now doing, :n<br />\ngeneral, little teaching and much research. If they spend more time with<br />\nundergraduates, they will have to<br />\nspend less time with graduate students and their own researches. This<br />\nhas been cited as a gain for the Undergraduates-something that they,<br />\nwho pay about the highest college<br />\ntuition in the country, have been<br />\nclamoring for.<br />\nWe are not so sure that the majority of undergraduates would rather merely be in the same lecture room<br />\nwith a professor of some reputation<br />\nor have personal instruction from the<br />\nbrilliant younger faculty minds. Perhaps, by a reapportionment of time.<br />\na mean can be reached whereby the<br />\n\"name\" men can give a little more<br />\nundergraduate courses and take a<br />\nlittle time of their own for investigations, and the younger men can be<br />\nfreed from some of their instructing<br />\nand allowed more time for research.<br />\nThis, however, solves no financial<br />\nproblem.<br />\nOther plans have been suggested<br />\nas alternatives to that of getting rid<br />\nof the up-and-coming faculty members. One is to cut the salaries of<br />\nenough of the better paid men to accomplish a saving of $40,000. Having<br />\nalready taken a 10 per cent cut, most<br />\nof the professors are against this.<br />\nSome say they would leave if that<br />\nwere done. Some are leaving anyway.<br />\nIn any case, while there is a deficit, the University can not spend the<br />\nmoney it should. The important thing<br />\nis for the University to get funds.<br />\nCertainly there is no inducement for<br />\nanybody to support the University<br />\nfinancially when the older men announce that they are resigning and<br />\nthe University announces that it is<br />\nfiring the younger men.

It has no plot worth mentioning; it is purely a personal narrative, a biography. But it is a story,<br />\nfull of the drama of human life-\"a tale of sad life\", as the author<br />\nsays, in the line which sets the mood<br />\nand atmosphere for the entire book.<br />\nThere is even some semblance of an<br />\nabortive love story; but, beyond the<br />\nfact that Oliver is not the type for<br />\nlove, except as duty requires, the<br />\nepilogue states unequivocally: \"Bah,<br />\nthere are love stories enough in the<br />\nbookstalls for those who like them.\"<br />\nThe Last Puritan contains no dialogue\u2014in the modern sense. Every<br />\ncharacter but one speaks in Mr. Santayana's inspired language, in his<br />\npoetical eloquence.

Oliver was a perfect<br />\nsynthesis of varied backgrounds -all culminating in the tragedy of the<br />\nultimate Puritan. His was a moral<br />\nnature, burdened and over-strung,<br />\nand a critical faculty \"fearless but<br />\nhelplessly subjective.\"<br />\nIn antithesis to Oliver Alden, there<br />\nis his closest friend Lord Jim,<br />\nthe captain of, his father's yacht.<br />\nLord Jim is the typical romantic<br />\ncavalier with an extra dash of the<br />\npagan.

They do a good deal of didactive work and have a vast amount<br />\nof academic promise.

If they spend more time with<br />\nundergraduates, they will have to<br />\nspend less time with graduate students and their own researches. This<br />\nhas been cited as a gain for the Undergraduates-something that they,<br />\nwho pay about the highest college<br />\ntuition in the country, have been<br />\nclamoring for.<br />\nWe are not so sure that the majority of undergraduates would rather merely be in the same lecture room<br />\nwith a professor of some reputation<br />\nor have personal instruction from the<br />\nbrilliant younger faculty minds. Perhaps, by a reapportionment of time.<br />\na mean can be reached whereby the<br />\n\"name\" men can give a little more<br />\nundergraduate courses and take a<br />\nlittle time of their own for investigations, and the younger men can be<br />\nfreed from some of their instructing<br />\nand allowed more time for research.<br />\nThis, however, solves no financial<br />\nproblem.<br />\nOther plans have been suggested<br />\nas alternatives to that of getting rid<br />\nof the up-and-coming faculty members. One is to cut the salaries of<br />\nenough of the better paid men to accomplish a saving of $40,000.

It has no plot worth mentioning; it is purely a personal narrative, a biography. But it is a story,<br />\nfull of the drama of human life-\"a tale of sad life\", as the author<br />\nsays, in the line which sets the mood<br />\nand atmosphere for the entire book.<br />\nThere is even some semblance of an<br />\nabortive love story; but, beyond the<br />\nfact that Oliver is not the type for<br />\nlove, except as duty requires, the<br />\nepilogue states unequivocally: \"Bah,<br />\nthere are love stories enough in the<br />\nbookstalls for those who like them.\"<br />\nThe Last Puritan contains no dialogue\u2014in the modern sense. Every<br />\ncharacter but one speaks in Mr. Santayana's inspired language, in his<br />\npoetical eloquence. But the author<br />\njustifies himself:<br /><br />\nshould come from<br /><br />\nTh,_: story of this novel-without-aplot concerns one Oliver Alden, a<br />\nyoung, intelligent, and handsome<br />\nPuritan, in whom \"Puritanism worked itself out to its logical end,\" who<br />\n\"convinced hmself on Puritan grounds<br />\nthat it was wrong to be a Puritan<br />\n. . . and remained a Puritan notwithstanding. Oliver was a perfect<br />\nsynthesis of varied backgrounds -all culminating in the tragedy of the<br />\nultimate Puritan. His was a moral<br />\nnature, burdened and over-strung,<br />\nand a critical faculty \"fearless but<br />\nhelplessly subjective.\"<br />\nIn antithesis to Oliver Alden, there<br />\nis his closest friend Lord Jim,<br />\nthe captain of, his father's yacht.<br />\nLord Jim is the typical romantic<br />\ncavalier with an extra dash of the<br />\npagan. To Oliver, he represents all<br />\nthat Oliver is not\u2014the personifies<br />\nfreedom and frankness; he loves the<br />\nworld and drinks deep from the cup<br />\nof life, enjoying it fully and living<br />\nit with all, his might. Lord Jim exerted a great influence on Oliver Alden's life.<br /><br />\nhumane philosophy, and<br /><br />\nyet it ap-<br /><br />\npears in an unorthodox form. Here<br />\nfor the first time, a philosopher does<br />\nnot argue nor prove nor criticize anything. He simply paints a picture-with a skilled, a delicate brush on<br />\nthe susceptible canvas of human<br />\nlife. \"The argument is dramatized,<br />\nthe views become human persuasions,<br />\nand the presentation is all the truer<br />\nfor not professing to be true.\"<br /><br />\nDr. Murnaghan To Speak<br />\nTo History Of Ideas Club<br />\n-Dr. Francis D.
