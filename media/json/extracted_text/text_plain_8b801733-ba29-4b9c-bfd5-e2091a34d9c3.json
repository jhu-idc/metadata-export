The<br />\nFrench had German captives and had<br />\nno way of taking care of them. Taking a census of the prisoners, they<br />\nfound all who had been farmers in<br />\ntheir native land. These were transferred to various farms throughout<br />\nFrance where the men of the house<br />\nhad gone to war. Surprisingly<br />\nenough, these germans got on very<br />\nwell with their hosts, none of the<br />\nnational hatreds cropping out in<br />\ntheir daily relations because the<br />\nthe Germans were on common<br />\nground.

The<br />\nFrench had German captives and had<br />\nno way of taking care of them. Taking a census of the prisoners, they<br />\nfound all who had been farmers in<br />\ntheir native land. These were transferred to various farms throughout<br />\nFrance where the men of the house<br />\nhad gone to war.

Up to date,<br />\nthe Jays have won one game while<br />\nlosing two, defeating an alumni team<br />\nand going down to defeat against<br />\nstrong Temple and Army quintets.<br />\nThese latter teams, however, boast<br />\ntwo of the best squads in the East<br />\nand defeats by them are no insult to<br />\nany school, particularly when it is<br />\nconsidered that the Jays gave a very<br />\nrespectable performance in each instance.<br />\nThe<br />\nMaryland<br />\nIntercollegiate<br />\nLeague can look forward to a closefought and interesting season this<br />\nyear. The league is very evenly balanced with no really outstanding<br />\nteam, although Washington and St.<br />\nMary's are the pre-season favorites.<br />\nWith the possible exception of Western Maryland, all the members<br />\nshould be stronger than last year,<br />\nwith the Jays right up among the<br />\nleaders.<br />\nThe Hopkinsites will present a veteran line-up, only one member of<br />\nthe starting team being a newcomer,<br />\nMelvin, a former prep star at<br />\nFriends School. Capt. George Margolis and Carl Rasin will start at the<br />\nguard positions, with Melvin playing center, while the forward posts<br />\nwill be taken care of by Herb Siegal<br />\nand Les \"Boyles\" Margolis. Siegal is<br />\none of the outstanding forwards in<br />\nthe State while Capt.

According to latest<br />\nreports, one hundred and fifty-five<br />\ndollars have already been taken in<br />\nand still more remains to be collected.<br />\nThe success of the gymboree reflects brightly on the entire student<br />\nbody as a whole, for it occurred just<br />\nat a time when the school spirit of<br />\nthe Hopkins, or rather lack of school<br />\nspirit, was being bemoaned from all<br />\nsides. It is as least a proof that<br />\nsuch spirit at the Hopkins is not, as<br />\nmany were beginning to suppose,<br />\nnon-existent, and, with a potentially<br />\nstrong basketball team in the offing<br />\nthere should be no lack of supporters..<br /><br />\ning team for the first time this year<br />\nganied<br />\nvaluable experience.
