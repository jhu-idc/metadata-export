At the present time the Greeks,<br />\nlike a peanut in a nutcracker, are wedged between the<br />\ngeneral run of neighbors at one handle and the University<br />\nHeights Improvement Association at the other, while the<br />\nBaltimore City Police Force is poised, though reluctant,<br />\nto give a shattering squeeze.<br />\nIt is unfair, though inevitable, that the present undergraduate fraternity man need take it on the chin not<br />\nonly for his own actions, but primarily for the party<br />\nnoise, drinking, and that which attends them, which has<br />\naccumulated over the past decade. And it is unfair that<br />\neleven of the thirteen houses must nest uneasily in residential rows, whose homes are equipped with antiquated<br />\nporous walls, and whose residents are often the old guard<br />\nof the dying Waverly area pseudo-aristocracy. The anger<br />\nwhich has frothed off and on for over a decade along<br />\nCharles and St. Paul and Calvert is set to boil over. The<br />\ntheatrics of Mr. Bennet and his wordy association we<br />\nknow well. But how many fraternity men realize that at<br />\nleast one fraternity has been warned that residents \"all<br />\nup and down the three block area\" (Calvert St. between<br />\n29th and 32nd) have formed a petition \"to close your<br />\ndoors\"?<br />\nThe Inter-fraternity Board is seriously considering<br />\nabolishing drinking during rush season, not only in an<br />\neffort to stifle neighborhood malcontent, but to aid in<br />\ncalming the orientation of freshmen to Hopkinsian fraternity life. We agree and heartily approve that the move<br />\nwould work out in the latter case, but we cannot agree<br />\nthat the abolition of drinking during the rushing period,<br />\nor even an absolute clamp down upon the drinking of<br />\nalcoholic beverages at any time, would alleviate the neighbor problem.<br />\nIt must be expected that in men of college age stereotyped fraternity antics will be the sometimes sister of the<br />\ngentlemen\u2014with or without drinking. By this time the<br />\nneighbors in the area of chopped-up fraternity row have<br />\nbeen hardened against the word \"fraternity,\" which to<br />\nthem includesflirty back yards, lewd conversations heard<br />\nthrough walls, and typewriters clacking at three o'clock<br />\nin the morning, none of which are necessarily caused by<br />\ninebriation. \"Fraternity\" is a symbol of that which shatters the calm of a staid residential area.<br />\nThe neighbors would like nothing better than to see<br />\nthe houses booted onto campus; the fraternities, for their<br />\nown welfare, would be better off on campus, free from<br />\nneighborhood cranks, free from the immediate jurisdiction of the Baltimore police, and existing in the liberal<br />\natmosphere of Homewood life. Not many years ago a<br />\nplan for such action was presented to the Inter-fraternity<br />\nBoard, and unfortunately rejected. But such a plan is<br />\nneeded now. Exactly where to place the houses on such<br />\na small campus, we know not. How, we know not. Dean<br />\nShaffer has stated that the possibility is presently an impossibility. Yet if the powers that be should strike, the<br />\nfraternity system at Hopkins may never recover. We find<br />\nno great leader to guide the Greeks over Charles Street<br />\nand into the promised land.

At the present time the Greeks,<br />\nlike a peanut in a nutcracker, are wedged between the<br />\ngeneral run of neighbors at one handle and the University<br />\nHeights Improvement Association at the other, while the<br />\nBaltimore City Police Force is poised, though reluctant,<br />\nto give a shattering squeeze.<br />\nIt is unfair, though inevitable, that the present undergraduate fraternity man need take it on the chin not<br />\nonly for his own actions, but primarily for the party<br />\nnoise, drinking, and that which attends them, which has<br />\naccumulated over the past decade. And it is unfair that<br />\neleven of the thirteen houses must nest uneasily in residential rows, whose homes are equipped with antiquated<br />\nporous walls, and whose residents are often the old guard<br />\nof the dying Waverly area pseudo-aristocracy. The anger<br />\nwhich has frothed off and on for over a decade along<br />\nCharles and St. Paul and Calvert is set to boil over. The<br />\ntheatrics of Mr. Bennet and his wordy association we<br />\nknow well. But how many fraternity men realize that at<br />\nleast one fraternity has been warned that residents \"all<br />\nup and down the three block area\" (Calvert St. between<br />\n29th and 32nd) have formed a petition \"to close your<br />\ndoors\"?<br />\nThe Inter-fraternity Board is seriously considering<br />\nabolishing drinking during rush season, not only in an<br />\neffort to stifle neighborhood malcontent, but to aid in<br />\ncalming the orientation of freshmen to Hopkinsian fraternity life. We agree and heartily approve that the move<br />\nwould work out in the latter case, but we cannot agree<br />\nthat the abolition of drinking during the rushing period,<br />\nor even an absolute clamp down upon the drinking of<br />\nalcoholic beverages at any time, would alleviate the neighbor problem.<br />\nIt must be expected that in men of college age stereotyped fraternity antics will be the sometimes sister of the<br />\ngentlemen\u2014with or without drinking. By this time the<br />\nneighbors in the area of chopped-up fraternity row have<br />\nbeen hardened against the word \"fraternity,\" which to<br />\nthem includesflirty back yards, lewd conversations heard<br />\nthrough walls, and typewriters clacking at three o'clock<br />\nin the morning, none of which are necessarily caused by<br />\ninebriation. \"Fraternity\" is a symbol of that which shatters the calm of a staid residential area.<br />\nThe neighbors would like nothing better than to see<br />\nthe houses booted onto campus; the fraternities, for their<br />\nown welfare, would be better off on campus, free from<br />\nneighborhood cranks, free from the immediate jurisdiction of the Baltimore police, and existing in the liberal<br />\natmosphere of Homewood life. Not many years ago a<br />\nplan for such action was presented to the Inter-fraternity<br />\nBoard, and unfortunately rejected. But such a plan is<br />\nneeded now. Exactly where to place the houses on such<br />\na small campus, we know not. How, we know not. Dean<br />\nShaffer has stated that the possibility is presently an impossibility. Yet if the powers that be should strike, the<br />\nfraternity system at Hopkins may never recover. We find<br />\nno great leader to guide the Greeks over Charles Street<br />\nand into the promised land.
