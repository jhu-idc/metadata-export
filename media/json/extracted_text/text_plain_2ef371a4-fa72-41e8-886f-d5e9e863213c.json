On account of this delay it<br />\nbecame so (lark at the beginning<br />\nof the second half that Dr. Abercrombie was forced to call the<br />\ngame.<br />\nThe field was very slippery and<br />\nmuddy, and there were many fumbles.

The juniors,<br />\nas was to be expected, -displayed<br />\nbetter teamwork, while the Eagles<br />\nseemed to have the best individual<br />\nplayers The Eagles were often<br />\npenalized for offside. There was<br />\n110 score until near the end of the<br />\nsecond half when Evans got the<br />\nball on a fumble on the Eagles'<br />\n8-yard line. In three downs the<br />\njuniors were able to gain but one<br />\nyard. Ott the fourth down, however, Baughman went through the<br />\nEagles line for TO yards and<br />\nit touchdown. The juniors failed to<br />\nkick goal. There was no further<br />\nscore that half, and the game was<br />\ncalled by Dr. Abercrombie directly after the kick-off in the second<br />\nhalf.

Although the<br />\ngame was scheduled for 4 o'clock,<br />\naml this time found the juniors all<br />\npresent, it was not until 4.45 that<br />\nthe Red Eagles made their appearance. On account of this delay it<br />\nbecame so (lark at the beginning<br />\nof the second half that Dr. Abercrombie was forced to call the<br />\ngame.<br />\nThe field was very slippery and<br />\nmuddy, and there were many fumbles.

The juniors,<br />\nas was to be expected, -displayed<br />\nbetter teamwork, while the Eagles<br />\nseemed to have the best individual<br />\nplayers The Eagles were often<br />\npenalized for offside. There was<br />\n110 score until near the end of the<br />\nsecond half when Evans got the<br />\nball on a fumble on the Eagles'<br />\n8-yard line. In three downs the<br />\njuniors were able to gain but one<br />\nyard. Ott the fourth down, however, Baughman went through the<br />\nEagles line for TO yards and<br />\nit touchdown.
