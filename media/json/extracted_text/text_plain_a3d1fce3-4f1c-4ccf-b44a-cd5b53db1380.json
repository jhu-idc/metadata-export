Huang<br />\nfeels most people are beginning<br />\nto forget about the crime<br />\nproblems at the Medical Institutions campus, since more than a<br />\nyear has passed since a Hopkins<br />\nmedical student was killed.<br />\nCurrently most faculty and<br />\nstudents only hear about crime<br />\nincidents \"through the grapevine,\" according to Huang.

No direct<br />\nstatistical data is presently released by the security department.<br />\nDr. Henry Sidell, Dean of<br />\nStudents at Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, explained that since<br />\nthere is no regular newspaper at<br />\nthe Medical Institutions, crime<br />\ninformation is harder to convey<br />\nto students and staff.

The<br />\nN-L is funded by undergraduate<br />\nmonies through the SAC, and is<br />\ntherefore only responsible to its<br />\npaying constituency.<br />\nI wondered how our reading<br />\nconstituency felt about that.<br />\nWhile the News-Letter is staffed<br />\nand funded by and for undergraduates, its purpose is to<br />\nreport on the many aspects<br />\nof university life. This includes<br />\nsuch diverse issues as rent<br />\ncontrol, admissions procedures,<br />\ncocaine busts, employee concerns, child care centers, tenure,<br />\nand student politics. I felt<br />\nthat whatever affected or concerned Hopkins students ought<br />\nto be reported. The distinction<br />\n<br />\nbetween grad and undergrad<br />\nstudents is not a clear one; a<br />\ngood deal of interaction between<br />\nthe two groups exist and what<br />\naffects one may also affect the<br />\nother.<br />\nI also thought graduate<br />\nstudent voices should be heard;<br />\ncertainly, our readers would find<br />\nnew perspectives on Homewood<br />\nlife an interesting change. I was<br />\nalso under the impression that<br />\ngraduate students could not<br />\nwrite for the N-L either! The<br />\nbenefits of having graduate student writers seemed to far<br />\noutweigh any \"disadvantages.\"<br />\nA visit to Chris Colombo,<br />\nthe Director of Student Services,<br />\nwas clearly necessary. When I<br />\nconfronted him with my question, however, I found that he<br />\nhad no objections to any of<br />\nmy suggestions. Campus news<br />\nincludes 'as many facets as<br />\nstudents find interesting, from<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\non the part of the security force, a private<br />\nfirm called ADVANCE. We found an<br />\nunwillingness on the part of the Med<br />\nSchool administration to take a stand on<br />\nthe issue. And we found Tom McGowan,<br />\nDirector of General Services at Hopkins<br />\nHospital. Mr. McGowan explained, in<br />\nrefusing to release statistics, that \"the<br />\nproblems are different than those at<br />\nHomewood.\"<br />\nThe problems are different. More<br />\nserious crimes occur, and fewer people<br />\nknow about them.<br />\nMcGowan - and the Med School<br />\ncommunity as a whole - would stand to<br />\ngain if the statistics were printed. There is<br />\nno justification for holding back, and<br />\nthere are several good reasons for seeing<br />\nthe information in print. These include a<br />\nmore informed public, an incentive for<br />\naction, and maybe a safer Med School.<br />\nA disgruntled N-L staffer once<br />\nsuggested that the Police Blotter only<br />\nserved to promote crime at Homewood.<br />\nAfter all, hadn't crime gone way up since<br />\nit had been published? The answer<br />\nis no, on two counts: first, the Blotter<br />\nonly serves as an outlet; more people are<br />\naware that they can report a theft or<br />\nassault. Secondly, and more important,<br />\nother people can see where crime occurs<br />\nand why - and perhaps avoid having the<br />\nsame thing happen again.<br />\n<br />\n. . . and a campus despairs. The<br />\nHomewood atmosphere, which we had<br />\nalways assumed to be technocratic and<br />\nnominally Republican, was aflutter Wednesday in a depressingly repetitive chain<br />\nof conversations. Phrases like \"anti-intellectualism\" and \"back to the 'us and<br />\nthem' syndrome\" were heard all over campus Wednesday. Never bef'bre have we<br />\nseen the student body displaying such a<br />\nsameness of mood: gloomy. We were<br />\nstruck by the amount of effort launched<br />\nWednesday to distance ourselves from the<br />\nvox populi.<br />\n<br />\nThe Republicans were, of course,<br />\nsmug and silent. As was the case in '52<br />\nand '56, the losing party gave eloquent<br />\nwakes, and the winners didn't say anything. Nor did they have to.<br />\n<br />\nIt's heartening, in a sad way, to see<br />\nso many discouraged people reaffirm their<br />\nbeliefs in the liberal tradition despite its<br />\noverwhelming rejection Tuesday. One<br />\nparticularly alarming topic of discussion<br />\nwas the Fair Campaign Act of 1976, a<br />\nloophole which allows unlimited contributions to the defeat of candidates.<br />\nSenators Culver, Church, Bayh and<br />\nMcGovern all became victims of \"moral<br />\nmajority\" target campaigns. We urge you<br />\nto encourage your senators to end this<br />\nlegalized form of political murder.<br />\nWe could weave all sorts of metaphysical cobwebs to deal with the rest of<br />\nthe mess, but why bother? Old Greasy<br />\nHair got himself elected, fair and square,<br />\nand now we've got to deal with it. Good<br />\nluck, Bonzo.<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editor<br />\nThe Man Of Steele<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nImagine my surprise<br />\nwhen I discovered that Michael<br />\nSteele was accused of antiSemitism. I have lived with<br />\nMichael for three years now,<br />\nand all that time he insulted<br />\nme, planted crosses at my<br />\ndoor, and threatened my family into releasing their control<br />\nover U.S. banks.<br />\nNot only does he dislike Jews, he hates whites as<br />\nwell. Really, it's terrible. Every<br />\nnight, he begs me to sell him to a<br />\nkinder boss.<br />\n<br />\nHe also hates men. I<br />\nthink it's Freudian, his father<br />\nlooks like Freud. He hates<br />\nwomen, too. Whenever I dress<br />\nin little cocktail frocks (available at Penney's at low, low<br />\nprices), he looks ill.<br />\nHe also hates blacks,<br />\nand has consulted specialists to<br />\nrepair his condition.<br />\nSeriously, folks, the accusation of anti-Semetism came<br />\nfrom a Canadian, and I think<br />\nthere lies the problem. If<br />\nthere's anything he hates more<br />\nthan Canadians<br />\nMichael Steele hates Jews<br />\nas much as he loves office<br />\npolitics and ridiculous harass-<br />\n<br />\nment.<br />\nTruly Jewish,<br />\nRob Friedman<br />\n<br />\nRocky Perpetrator<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI hope you won't mind if I<br />\ndon't give my name. I'd rather<br />\nnot come home one night to<br />\nfind a delegation of senior<br />\nlacrosse<br />\nplayers<br />\npatiently<br />\nwaiting.<br />\nI am the person who placed<br />\nthe \"Rocky Horror Picture<br />\nShow\" posters around campus<br />\nlast week. I acted on my own,<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\n<br />\nFilms,Sexism,Einolf Irk Readers<br />\ncont.from p.4<br />\nwithout confederates, and the<br />\nSenior Class Film Series had<br />\nnothing whatsoever to do with<br />\nthe hoax. It was, in essence,<br />\nan immense Halloween joke.<br />\nNow I'd like to clear up<br />\nsome things. First, the posters<br />\nwere not put up all over Baltimore as the News-Letter article<br />\nstated. (Not to blame them; a<br />\ncollege paper can't be expected<br />\nto report the facts without error<br />\nall the time, and I wish those<br />\nwho think it should would get<br />\noff their cases.) The first wave<br />\nof posters went up on Homewood campus and in several<br />\napartment<br />\nUniversity-owned<br />\nbuildings. The second wave was<br />\na retaliation against tearing them<br />\ndown on Campus\u2014not that I<br />\nblame them, but I wanted a fair<br />\nreturn on my investment. These<br />\nwere posted at two sister colleges. But none were put up in<br />\nthe city at large. While planning<br />\nthis caper several months ago, I<br />\nconsidered a general assault<br />\non the whole city, and even<br />\ngetting the announcement on 98<br />\nFM's Cheap Date schedule. I<br />\ndiscarded that plan. Though it<br />\nwould have drawn a much larger<br />\naudience, I didn't wish to risk<br />\nunseemly incidents by attracting<br />\nnonmembers of the \"educated<br />\ncollege intelligensia\", to put it at<br />\nits sweetest. I love this university every bit as much as Bill<br />\nDean does.<br />\nSecondly, the prank was not<br />\naimed at the Senior Class,<br />\nbut at the Hopkins Community<br />\nas a whole. I can see now that<br />\nI should have had the flick<br />\nsponsored by a fictitious organization, e.g. \"The Greater Maryland Celluloid Review.\" Not<br />\nonly would I have avoided<br />\nsingling anyone out, but my<br />\nposters would have stayed up<br />\nlonger. But when I concocted<br />\nthis gem, I felt that my major<br />\nproblem would be credibility. I<br />\nthought a \"surprise movie\"<br />\nwould look suspicious, one by<br />\nan unknown film society ridiculous. So I chose one of ours<br />\nat Hopkins randomly, judging<br />\nthe danger of a disclaimer as<br />\nthe lesser of the two. I hope the<br />\nSenior Class has the sense<br />\nof humor not to take it per-<br />\n<br />\nsonally.<br />\nCredibility, it turned out,<br />\nwas not a factor at all. The<br />\nfreshmen wandered about like<br />\npuzzled sheep, while the upperclassmen even had an authoritative answer (these ranged<br />\nfrom a knowledgeable surety<br />\nthat the film would go on at<br />\nsuch-and-such a place and time,<br />\nto suspicions that the Administration forbade the Senior<br />\nClass to hold a film after midnight, and less reasonable<br />\nthings.)But everyone who had<br />\nheard of it was sure that the<br />\nSenior Class had planned to<br />\nshow the \"Rocky Horror Picture<br />\nShow.\" The only question was<br />\nwhether or not it had been<br />\n\"cancelled.\" I could write a<br />\nthesis on the reactions I saw.<br />\nNow, as to Steele's and<br />\nDean's promise for an invesFirst,<br />\ntigation.<br />\nit will be a fairly tall order. I<br />\ncovered my tracks well, and have<br />\nSecond\u2014why<br />\nno confidants.<br />\nbother? The Senior Class has<br />\nclean hands, and I took measures<br />\nto keep the hoax from getting<br />\nout of hand. And I can't see<br />\nhow I hurt anything more than<br />\nsomeone's plans for the evening.<br />\nIf anyone differs on this, I'd like<br />\nto hear it. But the act was not<br />\nmalicious, so keep a sense of<br />\nhumor and admit you've been<br />\nhad.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nThe Perpetrator of the \"Rocky<br />\nHorror Picture Show\" Fraud.<br />\n<br />\nSue Thomas<br />\n<br />\nEven More Sexism<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nTo some misguided members of<br />\nthe Graduate Women's Co -nittee: (concerning their letter,<br />\n10/31)<br />\n(I) The nude female body is<br />\noften considered to be beautiful;<br />\nergo, it is a common subject of<br />\nphotographs and drawings (i.e.<br />\nart)...so common, in fact, that<br />\nthe depiction of a nude woman<br />\nrarely provokes hysteria.

As for the graphics<br />\nused in the computer art article<br />\n(Oct. 10), why couldn't the<br />\nauthor have used a picture of a<br />\nnude man as an example of<br />\nunimaginative computer art? We<br />\nreally don't need to see a picture<br />\nof a nude woman to understand<br />\nlack of imagination.<br />\n\"Isolated instances\" of sexism are still offensive and are noi<br />\nat all acceptable.

As an undergraduate editor, I rely on contacts<br />\nwithin the student body and the<br />\nadministration for news leads,<br />\nbut I can only report on what I<br />\nhear. If any student, grad or<br />\nundergrad, at Homewood, the<br />\nMedical School, SAIS or<br />\nBologna (or administrator or<br />\nstaff person for that matter) has<br />\nconcerns which he or she feels<br />\naffects Hopkins students, we<br />\nwould like to hear about them,<br />\nwhether through letters, articles,<br />\nsuggestions or commentaries.<br />\nThe N-L tries to represent its<br />\nreaders, and we would like to<br />\nexpand our ,coverage ft you.<br />\n<br />\nI would just like to express<br />\nmy disappointment in last<br />\nweek's edition of the NewsLetter. The Fine Arts page in<br />\nthat issue featured a two and a,<br />\nhalf column review of Bruce<br />\nSpringsteen's newest album, a<br />\nthree-column review of Robert<br />\nHeinlein's latest novel, and a one<br />\nand a half column article on the<br />\nBaltimore Symphony Orchestra.<br />\nI was mildly distressed to see<br />\nthat the News-Letter felt it had<br />\nto reach to such extremes to fill<br />\ntwo pages when this weekend<br />\nfeatured a very entertaining<br />\nproduction right on campus<br />\nwhich received no attention at<br />\nall - Namely, this year's Freshman One Act Festival.<br />\nThis year's One Acts,<br />\ndeemed by many as by far the<br />\nbest ever, featured a cast of over<br />\nseventy<br />\nextremely<br />\ntalented<br />\nfreshmen as well as a delightful<br />\nblend of comedy, drama and<br />\nsong and dance, all of which<br />\ndeserved some sort of recognition. I hate to believe that the<br />\nNews-Letter has deemed the<br />\nthree above-mentioned articles<br />\n(along with several illustrations<br />\nof a . dubious \"nature) as more<br />\nimportant or relevant than an<br />\nenjoyable evening of the students done entirely by the<br />\nstudents for the students. As a<br />\ncampus event, I think that this<br />\nshould have taken precedence<br />\nover any feature appearing in<br />\nlast issue's Fine Arts page.<br />\nA considerable number of<br />\nstudents put a tremendous a-<br />\n<br />\nmount of time and effort into<br />\nthis year's production, and as<br />\na campus newspaper, it is your<br />\nresponsibility to show your<br />\nsupport for student projects<br />\nsuch as this. One would think<br />\nthat after overlooking the Barnstormers' fall production of<br />\n\"Bell, Book and Candle\", you<br />\nwould have been a little more<br />\nconscientious in the future.<br />\nIn closing, I would just like<br />\nto express my profuse hope<br />\nthat in later editions, the NewsLetter will give recognition<br />\nwhere recognition is due and<br />\nattempt to establish a few<br />\npriorities when it comes to<br />\nactivities of genuine interest and<br />\nconcern to the students.<br />\nMark Briner '83<br />\nArts Editors Harris Gruinan<br />\nand CliffHarris respond:<br />\nWe appreciate your concern<br />\nfor the Arts page, but feel that<br />\nyou should redirect your missive<br />\nto the publicity staff of the<br />\nFreshman One Acts.

Bitter after-the-fact complaining never takes the place of<br />\nplanning and good foresight.

In the years that followed, the pro-statehood<br />\n.<br />\nparty known as the New Progressive Party (or NP13)<br />\ngained in popularity, particularly in the urban areas.<br />\nThe pro-commonwealth party or Popular Democratic<br />\nParty (PDP) which Munoz-Marin founded, still maintained its strength, partly due to the success of the ELA and<br />\nOperation Bootstrap, which transformed the once \"poor<br />\nhouse of the Caribbean\" into a prosperous, modern<br />\ncountry.<br />\nBy the mid-1960's, the NPP and PDP were in a<br />\ndead heat, exchanging the governor's chair in each<br />\nelection: Roberto Sanchez-Vilella (1964-PDP), Luis A.<br />\nFerre (1968-PNP), Rafael Hernandez-Colon (1972-PDP),<br />\nand Carlos Romero-Barcelo (1976-PNP).<br />\nThe two major parties also represent mainland<br />\npolitical tendencies. The NPP is a particularly right-wing<br />\nRepublican group. The PDP is moderately Democratic.<br />\nThe principal issue, though, is Statehood vs. Commonwealth.<br />\nCarlos Romero-Barcelo, the current governor of<br />\nPuerto Rico, is at the helm of the pro-statehood NPP.<br />\nRafael Hernandez-Colon, former governor in 1972, is<br />\natop the pro-commonwealth PDP. The two men are<br />\nworlds apart in both ideology and character and each<br />\nforesees a different future for Puerto Rico.<br />\nRomero is a stocky man. In person he seems<br />\n<br />\ntremendously emotional and perpetually anxious. His<br />\nwhite hair and marred complexion are prominent in his<br />\nappearance. He speaks agressively, using short phrases,<br />\nas though he were short of breath. He expresses his<br />\nopinion in a manner which shuts off all doors to any<br />\nother possibility. In my opinion (as you may have<br />\nguessed), he is a fanatic.<br />\nHernandez-Colon is a tall, attractive, colorful<br />\nman readily recognizable by his large prominent nose<br />\nand his captivating smile. He is a good listener, a characteristic seldom seen in a politician. On the campaign<br />\ntrail, he may stop and listen to the endless problems<br />\nof a poor, disenchanted lady. He speaks cautiously,<br />\ncarefully choosing his words and getting his point across<br />\nin a confident, persuasive manner. Romero, a Yale<br />\ngraduate, is by far the more astute political strategist.<br />\nHe is sly and witty, and he knows the ins and outs of<br />\npolitics.<br />\nHowever, Romero has a blind, all-consuming, and<br />\nfrightening obsession with statehood. To be more<br />\nprecise, he is obsessed with the idea. His actions can be<br />\ncompared to those of a mischievious youngster climbing<br />\nup on the kitchen counter to grab the cookie jar after his<br />\nmom has told him to get down. He will keep trying to<br />\nget those cookies, and trying and trying, until he slips.<br />\nHere the analogy ends, however, because the little fellow<br />\nends his quest for the cookies, while Romero will fight<br />\nto the end for statehood.<br />\nI see Romero as having two fundamental problems. First, he feels more American than he does Puerto<br />\nRican. Second, he is at constant odds with colonialism,<br />\nthe commonwealth status, and anything that concerns<br />\nthe Popular Democratic Party and what is stands for.<br />\nRomero is a Puerto Rican who wishes he were an<br />\nAmerican - full-blooded, blond, blue-eyed American.<br />\nAs time goes by, his wish turns into frustration. He<br />\ncan't understand why all the Puerto Ricans don't follow<br />\nhim in his mission to become a superior race. I say<br />\nsuperior race because in his eyes, he visualizes the<br />\nAmerican race as the epitomy of all mankind, the<br />\nperfect being. One can see this attitude in an article he<br />\nrecently published in this fall's issue of Foreign Affairs.<br />\nIn it he says, \"As second-class American citizens, Puerto<br />\nRicans are dismissed as 'colonial lackeys of the Yankee<br />\nImperialists' \" But statehood, he boasts, will be the<br />\nsolution to this because then and only then will the<br />\nUnited States \"accept Puerto Ricans as true equals, by<br />\nrespecting and embracing the island's Spanish language<br />\nand Afro-Caribbean cluture.\"<br />\nIn analyzing the second point, we should take an<br />\ninside look at Romero's youth. Juan Manuel Garcia<br />\nPassalacqua (attorney for the ADA chapter in Puerto<br />\nRico) in a recent commentary titled Who is Carlos<br />\nRomero-Barcelo published by the San Juan Star (October 17, 1980, page 19), gives us some insight:<br />\nRomero was raised for the first six years of his life under<br />\nthe shadow of his grandfather, Antonio R. Barcelo, a<br />\nbroken and bitter man resentful of Munoz(Mann)and<br />\nhis Popular Democratic Party. When he died, he remembered \"how badly he had felt in the last years of his<br />\nlife\". In a recent interview, Romero made an interesting<br />\n<br />\n\fadmission, \"I felt a committment. As a child, I felt a<br />\ncommittment.\" He did not elaborate, but it is easy to<br />\ndecipher what kind ofcommittment the child must have<br />\nmade at that time: he would vindicate his grandfather<br />\nby fighting against those he believed had embittered<br />\nthose last years ofhis life.<br />\n<br />\nto have the games called off if he didn't get \"his way\".<br />\nWith time and patience running out, the IOC gave in to<br />\nRomero's demands.<br />\nRomero paid a high price for his persistence. In<br />\nhis opening speech at the games, he was booed and<br />\nhissed so much by the standing-room-only crowd at<br />\n<br />\nIn a May, 1977 interview with CBS News, Hiram Bithorn Stadium that his speech was inaudible,<br />\nRomero said he would advocate independence for even on television.

Romero's continuous and<br />\nhood the culmination of colonialism?<br />\nHernandez-Colon, a Johns Hopkins graduate, is a fervent push toward statehood. Most alarming is a false<br />\nstrong advocate of commonwealth status and a fervent statehood he preaches known by some as \"Estadidad<br />\nopponent of statehood. Unlike Romero, he feels that Jibara\". This \"spic-style\" statehood - there is no better<br />\nstatehood would be disasterous for Puerto Rico socially, term for it - preaches that if Puerto Rico were to become<br />\neconomically and culturally.

At the PDP<br />\nheadquarters in Puerta de Tierra, thousands danced and<br />\nwaved their red PDP flags while singing HernandezColon's campaign song \"Rafael, Rafael,Puerto Rico cree<br />\nen el\"(Rafael, Puerto Rico believes in him).<br />\nIt was 8:00 pm. The song interrupted by the<br />\nblaring loudspeaker atop the headquarters.

The speaker continued \"PDF<br />\n325\". The crowd went into a frenzy: hugging, kissing,<br />\njumping, crying, throwing themselves on the street .in<br />\ntotal euphoria.

Few official<br />\nresults were coming in, and those which did, did so at a<br />\nsnail's pace as members of the SEC reverted to counting<br />\nballots by hand. As the night progressed, the NPP<br />\nwas publicizing its own results, which gave Romero the<br />\nlead while the PDP posted its vote counts, giving Hernandez-Colon the lead. Uncertainty reigned tbroughout<br />\nPuerto Rico.<br />\nAt 2:00 am, the State Elections Commission<br />\nannounced a preliminary result, with more than half the<br />\nvotes tabulated....a slim lead for Hernandez-Colon:<br />\n46.9%.<br />\n479,468<br />\n(PDP) Hernandez-Colon<br />\n46.2%<br />\n471,849<br />\n(PNP)Romero-Barcelo<br />\nBy 3:00 am, the PDP margin had vanished<br />\nmysteriously and the SEC claimed Romero had taken<br />\nan 0.1% lead. An angered Hernandez-Colon called the<br />\nState Elections Commission incompetent and was going<br />\nthere to supervise personally the ballot-counting procedure. On television, Romero claimed he would win by<br />\n20,000 votes. The PDP followers were fired up. Thousands flocked to the Roberto Clemente Coliseum where<br />\nthe SEC was at work. It was 4:30 am. Huge oil trucks<br />\ncarried party supporters waving their flags. Thousands<br />\nmobbed the streets. Cars and vans with deafening<br />\nspeakers blared PDP music. The crowd shouted that<br />\nRomero was trying to steal the elections.<br />\nA car passed through the mob flying an NPP flag.<br />\nThe enraged PDPer's tore off the flag and began beating<br />\nthe car with sticks.

The film contains considerablely less dialogue than the play, so<br />\nthe viewer is not given as much insight<br />\ninto the motivations, passions and fatal<br />\nweaknesses of the main characters.<br />\nThis is not a real problem, though, since<br />\nit is highly improbable that the people<br />\nwho would attend this film and view it<br />\ncritically would be familiar with Macbeth.<br />\nThrone of Blood is an excellent film, full<br />\nof the dazzling artistic acumen which we<br />\nhave come to expect of Kurosawa, but<br />\napplied in a different form.<br />\n(Reel World, Sunday Nov. 9, 7:30 pm)<br />\n<br />\nSuburban Drama<br />\n<br />\nFamily Trauma In Ordinary People<br />\ncharacters?<br />\nNevertheless, Ordinary People is a<br />\nrare film, one which captures the import<br />\nof human relationships without a heavyhanded effort.

For fans of<br />\nintellectual modern theatre (in the Equus<br />\nvein) this play will be enjoyable. Though<br />\nthe play suffers from sloppily crafted<br />\nexposition and lack of action, the dialogue is always pungent and consistently<br />\nentertaining.<br />\nThe play opens with psychiatrist<br />\nMartha Livingstone describing a peculiar<br />\nincident; a nun named Agnes had given<br />\nbirth to a child, and apparently tied the<br />\numbilical cord around the infant's neck<br />\nand shoved it into the garbage can.<br />\nThe nun , suffering from amnesia (naturally), is being tried for infanticide, and Dr.<br />\nLivingstone is investigating the case.<br />\nFor some unknown reason, Agnes'<br />\nMother Superior tries to prevent the<br />\ndoctor from learning too much. She<br />\nbelieves that Agnes is a saint, and doesn't<br />\nwant to see the girl's mind \"split open\".<br />\nThen, we learn that the Mother Superior<br />\nis Agnes' aunt. This seemingly significant<br />\npoint, which makes us suspicious of the<br />\nmother, turns out to be totally irrelevant.<br />\nThrough hypnotism (naturally)<br />\nthe psychiatrist learns that Agnes was<br />\nbrought up by a crazy woman who<br />\nsheltered her from the outside world to<br />\nprotect her innocence.<br />\nTherefore,<br />\nsince she's in a convent and innocent, we<br />\nbelieve that Agnes might be a virgin.<br />\nAgnes also bleeds spontaneously from the<br />\npalms. Confronted with these blatantly<br />\nreligious symbols, the audience is almost<br />\nready to agree with the Mother Superior<br />\nthat Agnes is truly a saint. But why did<br />\nshe kill her child?<br />\nScientists in the audience would<br />\nprobably explain Agnes as a neurotic and<br />\na hemopheliac, While the pious would<br />\nthink, \"It's God's work!\" Although the<br />\naction on stage reflects this sciencereligion dichotomy, the conflict is not<br />\nthat white and black.<br />\nThough the Mother Superior is<br />\nreligious, she is also a former chain<br />\nsmoker (who even says \"bullshit!\"), and<br />\n<br />\nhas definite qulams about her faith. She<br />\ndoesn't want Agnes psychoanalyzed, not<br />\nbecause she is guilty, but because it will<br />\ntake away Agnes' mystery. \"What we've<br />\ngained in logic,\" says the Mother,\"we've<br />\nlost in faith. We no longer have any sort<br />\nof primitive wonder.\" The Mother does<br />\nnot worship Christ, she worships mystery.<br />\nThe chain-smoking psychiatrist,<br />\nan ex-Catholic, has doubts about her<br />\nscience. She too tastes the charms of<br />\nAgnes' mystery. Unfortunately, this love<br />\nfor mystery convinces the psychiatrist to<br />\ngo back to the Church. That love for<br />\nmystery should translate into the Catholic Church seems a major flaw in the play.<br />\nClearly, the scientific and the<br />\nreligious are not opposites, but merely<br />\nreflections of each other. Agnes of God<br />\nattempts to merge science and religion.<br />\n<br />\ntwo traditionally antithetical viewpoints.<br />\nBoth worship mystery; science seeks it to<br />\ndestroy it, while religion seeks it to<br />\nattribute it to God.<br />\nPeilmeier presents to the audience, who have necessarily suspended<br />\ntheir disbelief, the mystery of Agnes.<br />\nAgnes, however, is obviously not a saint,'<br />\nfor no saint would kill an infant. Yet<br />\nwhat scientist can explain spontaneous<br />\nbleeding from the palms? Pielmeier has<br />\ngiven us a mystery.<br />\nThe resolution to this mystery is<br />\nobvious. Agnes bleeds because the author<br />\nwrote it into the play. But as viewers we<br />\nare taught to disregard this explanation.<br />\nPielmeier has thus given the audience, at<br />\nleast for a little while, an unexplainable<br />\nmystery to enjoy.<br />\nThe problem with such a tactic is<br />\n<br />\nDr. Livingstone embraces Agnes<br />\nthat it threatens the foundations of any<br />\nplay - the suspension of disbelief.

Huang<br />\nfeels most people are beginning<br />\nto forget about the crime<br />\nproblems at the Medical Institutions campus, since more than a<br />\nyear has passed since a Hopkins<br />\nmedical student was killed.<br />\nCurrently most faculty and<br />\nstudents only hear about crime<br />\nincidents \"through the grapevine,\" according to Huang.

No direct<br />\nstatistical data is presently released by the security department.<br />\nDr. Henry Sidell, Dean of<br />\nStudents at Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, explained that since<br />\nthere is no regular newspaper at<br />\nthe Medical Institutions, crime<br />\ninformation is harder to convey<br />\nto students and staff. The<br />\nDome, a Medical Institutions<br />\nmonthly publication, does print<br />\ncrime hotline information and<br />\noccassionally includes a crime-<br /><br />\nrelated story.<br />\n\"No strong attempts are<br />\nmade to keep people informed<br />\nabout the crime problem,\" Alan<br />\nSchwartz, a fourth year Hopkins<br />\nmedical student, added. \"If the<br />\ncont. on n. 3<br /><br />\nThe Student Council Committee on Committees will<br />\nexamine each of the candidates<br />\ncarefully, according to members.<br />\n\"We are looking for someone<br />\nwho will sacrifice everything<br />\nfor the Fair,\" said COC chairman and SC vice president<br />\nMichael Wallk. \"The Fair must<br />\ncome first.\"<br />\nWallk also said that the COC<br />\nis looking for someone who<br />\nworks well with people and with<br />\nthe SAC Office.

The distinction<br /><br />\nbetween grad and undergrad<br />\nstudents is not a clear one; a<br />\ngood deal of interaction between<br />\nthe two groups exist and what<br />\naffects one may also affect the<br />\nother.<br />\nI also thought graduate<br />\nstudent voices should be heard;<br />\ncertainly, our readers would find<br />\nnew perspectives on Homewood<br />\nlife an interesting change. I was<br />\nalso under the impression that<br />\ngraduate students could not<br />\nwrite for the N-L either! The<br />\nbenefits of having graduate student writers seemed to far<br />\noutweigh any \"disadvantages.\"<br />\nA visit to Chris Colombo,<br />\nthe Director of Student Services,<br />\nwas clearly necessary. When I<br />\nconfronted him with my question, however, I found that he<br />\nhad no objections to any of<br />\nmy suggestions. Campus news<br />\nincludes 'as many facets as<br />\nstudents find interesting, from<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\non the part of the security force, a private<br />\nfirm called ADVANCE. We found an<br />\nunwillingness on the part of the Med<br />\nSchool administration to take a stand on<br />\nthe issue. And we found Tom McGowan,<br />\nDirector of General Services at Hopkins<br />\nHospital. Mr. McGowan explained, in<br />\nrefusing to release statistics, that \"the<br />\nproblems are different than those at<br />\nHomewood.\"<br />\nThe problems are different. More<br />\nserious crimes occur, and fewer people<br />\nknow about them.<br />\nMcGowan - and the Med School<br />\ncommunity as a whole - would stand to<br />\ngain if the statistics were printed. There is<br />\nno justification for holding back, and<br />\nthere are several good reasons for seeing<br />\nthe information in print. These include a<br />\nmore informed public, an incentive for<br />\naction, and maybe a safer Med School.<br />\nA disgruntled N-L staffer once<br />\nsuggested that the Police Blotter only<br />\nserved to promote crime at Homewood.<br />\nAfter all, hadn't crime gone way up since<br />\nit had been published? The answer<br />\nis no, on two counts: first, the Blotter<br />\nonly serves as an outlet; more people are<br />\naware that they can report a theft or<br />\nassault. Secondly, and more important,<br />\nother people can see where crime occurs<br />\nand why - and perhaps avoid having the<br />\nsame thing happen again.<br /><br />\n. . . and a campus despairs. The<br />\nHomewood atmosphere, which we had<br />\nalways assumed to be technocratic and<br />\nnominally Republican, was aflutter Wednesday in a depressingly repetitive chain<br />\nof conversations. Phrases like \"anti-intellectualism\" and \"back to the 'us and<br />\nthem' syndrome\" were heard all over campus Wednesday. Never bef'bre have we<br />\nseen the student body displaying such a<br />\nsameness of mood: gloomy. We were<br />\nstruck by the amount of effort launched<br />\nWednesday to distance ourselves from the<br />\nvox populi.<br /><br />\nThe Republicans were, of course,<br />\nsmug and silent. As was the case in '52<br />\nand '56, the losing party gave eloquent<br />\nwakes, and the winners didn't say anything. Nor did they have to.<br /><br />\nIt's heartening, in a sad way, to see<br />\nso many discouraged people reaffirm their<br />\nbeliefs in the liberal tradition despite its<br />\noverwhelming rejection Tuesday.

I have lived with<br />\nMichael for three years now,<br />\nand all that time he insulted<br />\nme, planted crosses at my<br />\ndoor, and threatened my family into releasing their control<br />\nover U.S. banks.<br />\nNot only does he dislike Jews, he hates whites as<br />\nwell. Really, it's terrible. Every<br />\nnight, he begs me to sell him to a<br />\nkinder boss.<br /><br />\nHe also hates men. I<br />\nthink it's Freudian, his father<br />\nlooks like Freud. He hates<br />\nwomen, too. Whenever I dress<br />\nin little cocktail frocks (available at Penney's at low, low<br />\nprices), he looks ill.<br />\nHe also hates blacks,<br />\nand has consulted specialists to<br />\nrepair his condition.<br />\nSeriously, folks, the accusation of anti-Semetism came<br />\nfrom a Canadian, and I think<br />\nthere lies the problem. If<br />\nthere's anything he hates more<br />\nthan Canadians<br />\nMichael Steele hates Jews<br />\nas much as he loves office<br />\npolitics and ridiculous harass-<br /><br />\nment.<br />\nTruly Jewish,<br />\nRob Friedman<br /><br />\nRocky Perpetrator<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI hope you won't mind if I<br />\ndon't give my name. I'd rather<br />\nnot come home one night to<br />\nfind a delegation of senior<br />\nlacrosse<br />\nplayers<br />\npatiently<br />\nwaiting.<br />\nI am the person who placed<br />\nthe \"Rocky Horror Picture<br />\nShow\" posters around campus<br />\nlast week. I acted on my own,<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editor<br /><br />\nFilms,Sexism,Einolf Irk Readers<br />\ncont.from p.4<br />\nwithout confederates, and the<br />\nSenior Class Film Series had<br />\nnothing whatsoever to do with<br />\nthe hoax. It was, in essence,<br />\nan immense Halloween joke.<br />\nNow I'd like to clear up<br />\nsome things. First, the posters<br />\nwere not put up all over Baltimore as the News-Letter article<br />\nstated. (Not to blame them; a<br />\ncollege paper can't be expected<br />\nto report the facts without error<br />\nall the time, and I wish those<br />\nwho think it should would get<br />\noff their cases.) The first wave<br />\nof posters went up on Homewood campus and in several<br />\napartment<br />\nUniversity-owned<br />\nbuildings. The second wave was<br />\na retaliation against tearing them<br />\ndown on Campus\u2014not that I<br />\nblame them, but I wanted a fair<br />\nreturn on my investment. These<br />\nwere posted at two sister colleges. But none were put up in<br />\nthe city at large. While planning<br />\nthis caper several months ago, I<br />\nconsidered a general assault<br />\non the whole city, and even<br />\ngetting the announcement on 98<br />\nFM's Cheap Date schedule. I<br />\ndiscarded that plan. Though it<br />\nwould have drawn a much larger<br />\naudience, I didn't wish to risk<br />\nunseemly incidents by attracting<br />\nnonmembers of the \"educated<br />\ncollege intelligensia\", to put it at<br />\nits sweetest. I love this university every bit as much as Bill<br />\nDean does.<br />\nSecondly, the prank was not<br />\naimed at the Senior Class,<br />\nbut at the Hopkins Community<br />\nas a whole. I can see now that<br />\nI should have had the flick<br />\nsponsored by a fictitious organization, e.g. \"The Greater Maryland Celluloid Review.\" Not<br />\nonly would I have avoided<br />\nsingling anyone out, but my<br />\nposters would have stayed up<br />\nlonger. But when I concocted<br />\nthis gem, I felt that my major<br />\nproblem would be credibility. I<br />\nthought a \"surprise movie\"<br />\nwould look suspicious, one by<br />\nan unknown film society ridiculous. So I chose one of ours<br />\nat Hopkins randomly, judging<br />\nthe danger of a disclaimer as<br />\nthe lesser of the two. I hope the<br />\nSenior Class has the sense<br />\nof humor not to take it per-<br /><br />\nsonally.<br />\nCredibility, it turned out,<br />\nwas not a factor at all. The<br />\nfreshmen wandered about like<br />\npuzzled sheep, while the upperclassmen even had an authoritative answer (these ranged<br />\nfrom a knowledgeable surety<br />\nthat the film would go on at<br />\nsuch-and-such a place and time,<br />\nto suspicions that the Administration forbade the Senior<br />\nClass to hold a film after midnight, and less reasonable<br />\nthings.)But everyone who had<br />\nheard of it was sure that the<br />\nSenior Class had planned to<br />\nshow the \"Rocky Horror Picture<br />\nShow.\" The only question was<br />\nwhether or not it had been<br />\n\"cancelled.\" I could write a<br />\nthesis on the reactions I saw.<br />\nNow, as to Steele's and<br />\nDean's promise for an invesFirst,<br />\ntigation.<br />\nit will be a fairly tall order. I<br />\ncovered my tracks well, and have<br />\nSecond\u2014why<br />\nno confidants.<br />\nbother? The Senior Class has<br />\nclean hands, and I took measures<br />\nto keep the hoax from getting<br />\nout of hand. And I can't see<br />\nhow I hurt anything more than<br />\nsomeone's plans for the evening.<br />\nIf anyone differs on this, I'd like<br />\nto hear it. But the act was not<br />\nmalicious, so keep a sense of<br />\nhumor and admit you've been<br />\nhad.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nThe Perpetrator of the \"Rocky<br />\nHorror Picture Show\" Fraud.<br /><br />\nSue Thomas<br /><br />\nEven More Sexism<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nTo some misguided members of<br />\nthe Graduate Women's Co -nittee: (concerning their letter,<br />\n10/31)<br />\n(I) The nude female body is<br />\noften considered to be beautiful;<br />\nergo, it is a common subject of<br />\nphotographs and drawings (i.e.<br />\nart)...so common, in fact, that<br />\nthe depiction of a nude woman<br />\nrarely provokes hysteria.

As for the graphics<br />\nused in the computer art article<br />\n(Oct. 10), why couldn't the<br />\nauthor have used a picture of a<br />\nnude man as an example of<br />\nunimaginative computer art?

As an undergraduate editor, I rely on contacts<br />\nwithin the student body and the<br />\nadministration for news leads,<br />\nbut I can only report on what I<br />\nhear. If any student, grad or<br />\nundergrad, at Homewood, the<br />\nMedical School, SAIS or<br />\nBologna (or administrator or<br />\nstaff person for that matter) has<br />\nconcerns which he or she feels<br />\naffects Hopkins students, we<br />\nwould like to hear about them,<br />\nwhether through letters, articles,<br />\nsuggestions or commentaries.<br />\nThe N-L tries to represent its<br />\nreaders, and we would like to<br />\nexpand our ,coverage ft you.<br /><br />\nI would just like to express<br />\nmy disappointment in last<br />\nweek's edition of the NewsLetter. The Fine Arts page in<br />\nthat issue featured a two and a,<br />\nhalf column review of Bruce<br />\nSpringsteen's newest album, a<br />\nthree-column review of Robert<br />\nHeinlein's latest novel, and a one<br />\nand a half column article on the<br />\nBaltimore Symphony Orchestra.<br />\nI was mildly distressed to see<br />\nthat the News-Letter felt it had<br />\nto reach to such extremes to fill<br />\ntwo pages when this weekend<br />\nfeatured a very entertaining<br />\nproduction right on campus<br />\nwhich received no attention at<br />\nall - Namely, this year's Freshman One Act Festival.<br />\nThis year's One Acts,<br />\ndeemed by many as by far the<br />\nbest ever, featured a cast of over<br />\nseventy<br />\nextremely<br />\ntalented<br />\nfreshmen as well as a delightful<br />\nblend of comedy, drama and<br />\nsong and dance, all of which<br />\ndeserved some sort of recognition. I hate to believe that the<br />\nNews-Letter has deemed the<br />\nthree above-mentioned articles<br />\n(along with several illustrations<br />\nof a . dubious \"nature) as more<br />\nimportant or relevant than an<br />\nenjoyable evening of the students done entirely by the<br />\nstudents for the students. As a<br />\ncampus event, I think that this<br />\nshould have taken precedence<br />\nover any feature appearing in<br />\nlast issue's Fine Arts page.<br />\nA considerable number of<br />\nstudents put a tremendous a-<br /><br />\nmount of time and effort into<br />\nthis year's production, and as<br />\na campus newspaper, it is your<br />\nresponsibility to show your<br />\nsupport for student projects<br />\nsuch as this. One would think<br />\nthat after overlooking the Barnstormers' fall production of<br />\n\"Bell, Book and Candle\", you<br />\nwould have been a little more<br />\nconscientious in the future.<br />\nIn closing, I would just like<br />\nto express my profuse hope<br />\nthat in later editions, the NewsLetter will give recognition<br />\nwhere recognition is due and<br />\nattempt to establish a few<br />\npriorities when it comes to<br />\nactivities of genuine interest and<br />\nconcern to the students.<br />\nMark Briner '83<br />\nArts Editors Harris Gruinan<br />\nand CliffHarris respond:<br />\nWe appreciate your concern<br />\nfor the Arts page, but feel that<br />\nyou should redirect your missive<br />\nto the publicity staff of the<br />\nFreshman One Acts.

Bitter after-the-fact complaining never takes the place of<br />\nplanning and good foresight.

As you approach, you hear a<br />\nloud rhytbmic band thumping out music to more than<br />\n800 high school students and their parents. No one<br />\nwants to leave the party. The dance floor is packed.<br />\nRum, vodka, mixers and beer are provided for each table<br />\nof students.<br />\nThe parents, not seated far away, serve as chaperons. On the dance floor, a young couple cuddles up on<br />\nthe crowded floor and sneaks a kiss when no one is<br />\nwatching.<br />\nMeanwhile, in the country, the roosters and their<br />\ncustomary kikiriki signal the start of a new day for<br />\nhundreds of farmers. This-is Puerto Rico.<br />\nThe isle is a fertile, mountainous land, 100 miles<br />\nlong and 35 miles wide. In this tropical nest, nearly 3.5<br />\nmillion inhabitants conviven(learn to live) in the country, city and shore.<br />\nPuerto Rico was .a colony of Spain until the<br />\nSpanish-American War brought the island into the hands<br />\nof the Americans, a situation that was not very popular<br />\nwith the pro-independence movement, a strong but not<br />\ndominant force. Then, in 1916, the Organic Act granted<br />\nU.S. citizenship to the people of Puerto Rico. This<br />\ncitizenship is a legal right which no Congress, no President of the United States, nor any other authority can<br />\ntake away. Only the individual, by his or her own will,<br />\ncan forfeit it.<br />\nIn a message to Congress on December 6th,<br />\n1912,President William H. Taft said:<br />\nI believe there does not exist substantial public<br />\nopinion neither in the United States, nor in Puerto Rico<br />\nthat foresees statehood as a definite solution to our<br />\nrelationship. My opinion is that the objective we should<br />\nstrive for should be to grant the maximal autonomy<br />\nto Puerto Rico's fiscal and local government, together<br />\nwith the American citizenship as a bridge between us: in<br />\nother words, a relationship analogous to that which<br />\ncurrently exists between Great Britain and its autono-<br /><br />\n\"There are those who love P.R. as much as I, but none<br />\nmore than me, ha ha.\"<br />\ndecline. In the years that followed, the pro-statehood<br />\n.<br />\nparty known as the New Progressive Party (or NP13)<br />\ngained in popularity, particularly in the urban areas.<br />\nThe pro-commonwealth party or Popular Democratic<br />\nParty (PDP) which Munoz-Marin founded, still maintained its strength, partly due to the success of the ELA and<br />\nOperation Bootstrap, which transformed the once \"poor<br />\nhouse of the Caribbean\" into a prosperous, modern<br />\ncountry.<br />\nBy the mid-1960's, the NPP and PDP were in a<br />\ndead heat, exchanging the governor's chair in each<br />\nelection: Roberto Sanchez-Vilella (1964-PDP), Luis A.<br />\nFerre (1968-PNP), Rafael Hernandez-Colon (1972-PDP),<br />\nand Carlos Romero-Barcelo (1976-PNP).<br />\nThe two major parties also represent mainland<br />\npolitical tendencies. The NPP is a particularly right-wing<br />\nRepublican group. The PDP is moderately Democratic.<br />\nThe principal issue, though, is Statehood vs. Commonwealth.<br />\nCarlos Romero-Barcelo, the current governor of<br />\nPuerto Rico, is at the helm of the pro-statehood NPP.<br />\nRafael Hernandez-Colon, former governor in 1972, is<br />\natop the pro-commonwealth PDP. The two men are<br />\nworlds apart in both ideology and character and each<br />\nforesees a different future for Puerto Rico.<br />\nRomero is a stocky man. In person he seems<br /><br />\ntremendously emotional and perpetually anxious. His<br />\nwhite hair and marred complexion are prominent in his<br />\nappearance. He speaks agressively, using short phrases,<br />\nas though he were short of breath. He expresses his<br />\nopinion in a manner which shuts off all doors to any<br />\nother possibility. In my opinion (as you may have<br />\nguessed), he is a fanatic.<br />\nHernandez-Colon is a tall, attractive, colorful<br />\nman readily recognizable by his large prominent nose<br />\nand his captivating smile. He is a good listener, a characteristic seldom seen in a politician. On the campaign<br />\ntrail, he may stop and listen to the endless problems<br />\nof a poor, disenchanted lady. He speaks cautiously,<br />\ncarefully choosing his words and getting his point across<br />\nin a confident, persuasive manner. Romero, a Yale<br />\ngraduate, is by far the more astute political strategist.<br />\nHe is sly and witty, and he knows the ins and outs of<br />\npolitics.<br />\nHowever, Romero has a blind, all-consuming, and<br />\nfrightening obsession with statehood. To be more<br />\nprecise, he is obsessed with the idea. His actions can be<br />\ncompared to those of a mischievious youngster climbing<br />\nup on the kitchen counter to grab the cookie jar after his<br />\nmom has told him to get down. He will keep trying to<br />\nget those cookies, and trying and trying, until he slips.<br />\nHere the analogy ends, however, because the little fellow<br />\nends his quest for the cookies, while Romero will fight<br />\nto the end for statehood.<br />\nI see Romero as having two fundamental problems. First, he feels more American than he does Puerto<br />\nRican. Second, he is at constant odds with colonialism,<br />\nthe commonwealth status, and anything that concerns<br />\nthe Popular Democratic Party and what is stands for.<br />\nRomero is a Puerto Rican who wishes he were an<br />\nAmerican - full-blooded, blond, blue-eyed American.<br />\nAs time goes by, his wish turns into frustration. He<br />\ncan't understand why all the Puerto Ricans don't follow<br />\nhim in his mission to become a superior race. I say<br />\nsuperior race because in his eyes, he visualizes the<br />\nAmerican race as the epitomy of all mankind, the<br />\nperfect being. One can see this attitude in an article he<br />\nrecently published in this fall's issue of Foreign Affairs.<br />\nIn it he says, \"As second-class American citizens, Puerto<br />\nRicans are dismissed as 'colonial lackeys of the Yankee<br />\nImperialists' \" But statehood, he boasts, will be the<br />\nsolution to this because then and only then will the<br />\nUnited States \"accept Puerto Ricans as true equals, by<br />\nrespecting and embracing the island's Spanish language<br />\nand Afro-Caribbean cluture.\"<br />\nIn analyzing the second point, we should take an<br />\ninside look at Romero's youth. Juan Manuel Garcia<br />\nPassalacqua (attorney for the ADA chapter in Puerto<br />\nRico) in a recent commentary titled Who is Carlos<br />\nRomero-Barcelo published by the San Juan Star (October 17, 1980, page 19), gives us some insight:<br />\nRomero was raised for the first six years of his life under<br />\nthe shadow of his grandfather, Antonio R. Barcelo, a<br />\nbroken and bitter man resentful of Munoz(Mann)and<br />\nhis Popular Democratic Party. When he died, he remembered \"how badly he had felt in the last years of his<br />\nlife\". In a recent interview, Romero made an interesting<br /><br />\nadmission, \"I felt a committment. As a child, I felt a<br />\ncommittment.\" He did not elaborate, but it is easy to<br />\ndecipher what kind ofcommittment the child must have<br />\nmade at that time: he would vindicate his grandfather<br />\nby fighting against those he believed had embittered<br />\nthose last years ofhis life.<br /><br />\nto have the games called off if he didn't get \"his way\".<br />\nWith time and patience running out, the IOC gave in to<br />\nRomero's demands.<br />\nRomero paid a high price for his persistence. In<br />\nhis opening speech at the games, he was booed and<br />\nhissed so much by the standing-room-only crowd at<br /><br />\nIn a May, 1977 interview with CBS News, Hiram Bithorn Stadium that his speech was inaudible,<br />\nRomero said he would advocate independence for even on television. To make matters worse, the crowd<br />\nPuerto Rico should the island be denied statehood. In proceeded to boo the American flag and anthem. Needdefending this line of thought, he reverts to the argu- less to say, this was embarrasing for the American<br />\nment that he is a fervent opponent of colonialism and athletes and the governor as well.<br />\nthat he represents \"a people no longer willing to conIf anything has been characteristic of these past<br />\ntinue tolerating political inferiority.\" But isn't statefour years, it has been Gov. Romero's continuous and<br />\nhood the culmination of colonialism?<br />\nHernandez-Colon, a Johns Hopkins graduate, is a fervent push toward statehood. Most alarming is a false<br />\nstrong advocate of commonwealth status and a fervent statehood he preaches known by some as \"Estadidad<br />\nopponent of statehood. Unlike Romero, he feels that Jibara\". This \"spic-style\" statehood - there is no better<br />\nstatehood would be disasterous for Puerto Rico socially, term for it - preaches that if Puerto Rico were to become<br />\neconomically and culturally. His solutions lie in his a state of the Union, it would:<br />\nNueva Tesis, or \"New Thesis\", a strategy to culminate<br />\n1. still compete as a separate entity in the Pan<br />\nthe ELA by achieving maximal autonomy and using<br />\nand Olympic games, international beauty<br />\nAmerican<br />\nthe<br />\nsolve<br />\nthe new powers together with current ones to<br />\ncontests and , other internation competitions - that is,<br />\nproblems afflicting Puerto Rico.<br />\nRomero's treatment of opposing political views compete as Puerto Rico (This is like having Maryland<br />\nwas, perhaps, exemplified by the Cerro Maravilla Case, a send its own Olympic. team to compete against the rest<br />\nscandal in which the national police department\" has of the US.).<br />\n2. not have to pay Federal income tax (for at<br />\nbeen accused of a cover-up in the killing of two young<br />\nadvocates of independedce.

For fans of<br />\nintellectual modern theatre (in the Equus<br />\nvein) this play will be enjoyable. Though<br />\nthe play suffers from sloppily crafted<br />\nexposition and lack of action, the dialogue is always pungent and consistently<br />\nentertaining.<br />\nThe play opens with psychiatrist<br />\nMartha Livingstone describing a peculiar<br />\nincident; a nun named Agnes had given<br />\nbirth to a child, and apparently tied the<br />\numbilical cord around the infant's neck<br />\nand shoved it into the garbage can.<br />\nThe nun , suffering from amnesia (naturally), is being tried for infanticide, and Dr.<br />\nLivingstone is investigating the case.<br />\nFor some unknown reason, Agnes'<br />\nMother Superior tries to prevent the<br />\ndoctor from learning too much. She<br />\nbelieves that Agnes is a saint, and doesn't<br />\nwant to see the girl's mind \"split open\".<br />\nThen, we learn that the Mother Superior<br />\nis Agnes' aunt. This seemingly significant<br />\npoint, which makes us suspicious of the<br />\nmother, turns out to be totally irrelevant.<br />\nThrough hypnotism (naturally)<br />\nthe psychiatrist learns that Agnes was<br />\nbrought up by a crazy woman who<br />\nsheltered her from the outside world to<br />\nprotect her innocence.<br />\nTherefore,<br />\nsince she's in a convent and innocent, we<br />\nbelieve that Agnes might be a virgin.<br />\nAgnes also bleeds spontaneously from the<br />\npalms. Confronted with these blatantly<br />\nreligious symbols, the audience is almost<br />\nready to agree with the Mother Superior<br />\nthat Agnes is truly a saint. But why did<br />\nshe kill her child?<br />\nScientists in the audience would<br />\nprobably explain Agnes as a neurotic and<br />\na hemopheliac, While the pious would<br />\nthink, \"It's God's work!\" Although the<br />\naction on stage reflects this sciencereligion dichotomy, the conflict is not<br />\nthat white and black.<br />\nThough the Mother Superior is<br />\nreligious, she is also a former chain<br />\nsmoker (who even says \"bullshit!\"), and<br /><br />\nhas definite qulams about her faith. She<br />\ndoesn't want Agnes psychoanalyzed, not<br />\nbecause she is guilty, but because it will<br />\ntake away Agnes' mystery. \"What we've<br />\ngained in logic,\" says the Mother,\"we've<br />\nlost in faith. We no longer have any sort<br />\nof primitive wonder.\" The Mother does<br />\nnot worship Christ, she worships mystery.<br />\nThe chain-smoking psychiatrist,<br />\nan ex-Catholic, has doubts about her<br />\nscience. She too tastes the charms of<br />\nAgnes' mystery. Unfortunately, this love<br />\nfor mystery convinces the psychiatrist to<br />\ngo back to the Church. That love for<br />\nmystery should translate into the Catholic Church seems a major flaw in the play.<br />\nClearly, the scientific and the<br />\nreligious are not opposites, but merely<br />\nreflections of each other. Agnes of God<br />\nattempts to merge science and religion.<br /><br />\ntwo traditionally antithetical viewpoints.<br />\nBoth worship mystery; science seeks it to<br />\ndestroy it, while religion seeks it to<br />\nattribute it to God.<br />\nPeilmeier presents to the audience, who have necessarily suspended<br />\ntheir disbelief, the mystery of Agnes.<br />\nAgnes, however, is obviously not a saint,'<br />\nfor no saint would kill an infant. Yet<br />\nwhat scientist can explain spontaneous<br />\nbleeding from the palms? Pielmeier has<br />\ngiven us a mystery.<br />\nThe resolution to this mystery is<br />\nobvious. Agnes bleeds because the author<br />\nwrote it into the play. But as viewers we<br />\nare taught to disregard this explanation.<br />\nPielmeier has thus given the audience, at<br />\nleast for a little while, an unexplainable<br />\nmystery to enjoy.<br />\nThe problem with such a tactic is<br /><br />\nDr. Livingstone embraces Agnes<br />\nthat it threatens the foundations of any<br />\nplay - the suspension of disbelief.
