He concluded that \"Baltimore remains an<br />\nunderdeveloped public radio<br />\nlistening audience.

The four item<br />\npolicy requires dogs on University property to be licensed,<br />\nleashed, and under the control<br />\nof their owners.<br />\nThe policy was instigated by<br />\n\"constant complaints\" of dogs<br />\nloose or tied to trees during inclement weather while their<br />\nowners were in class. Several<br />\npeople were also attacked by<br />\ndogs on campus last year. To<br />\nColombo's knowledge, no ac-<br />\n<br />\ntion has been taken against the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe idea behind the policy is<br />\nto force owners to take responsible action in regards to their<br />\ndogs. This is not meant to stop<br />\ndogs from exercising on campus grounds or chasing frisbees.<br />\nIf the owner is suitably confident that the animal is under his<br />\ncontrol while loose, it may go<br />\nabout leashless in the owner's<br />\npresence. This responsibility is<br />\nleft to the owner.<br />\nDogs are not allowed in common areas of the University<br />\nbuildings except when being<br />\ntaken directly to or from nonpublic areas. This allows<br />\nowners to utilize campus<br />\nbuilding shortcuts (i.e. through<br />\nGilman) with their dogs as long<br />\n<br />\nas they are just passing<br />\nthrough.<br />\nGuide dogs for the visually<br />\nimpaired are not subject to<br />\nthese restriction.

He was the son of David<br />\nJ. Eisenhower, an engineer,<br />\nand Ida E. Eisenhower. He<br />\nbegan his career as a reporter,<br />\nand then city editor, for the daily and weekly Abilene Reflector. Milton Eisenhower always<br />\ncredited Charles M.

In 1924, he went<br />\nto the University of Edinburgh<br />\nfor his graduate studies, after<br />\nbeing appointed by Charles<br />\nEvans Hughes as Vice Consul<br />\nto Edinburgh, Scotland.

During the eight years from<br />\n1953-1961, the U.S. reversed<br />\nmuch of its policy toward Latin<br />\nAmerica. Among the measures<br />\ntaken were a fostering of<br />\nregional common markets,<br />\nestablishment of study groups<br />\non Latin American commodities, and the Inter<br />\n<br />\nAmerica bank. The study<br />\ngroups were developed in an effort to stabilize the prices of<br />\nprimary agricultural and<br />\nmineral exports.

The key question now: will it<br />\nfollow through?<br />\nThe decision to drop the MCAT, the<br />\nstandard medical school admissions test,<br />\nas a requirement was clearly a victory for<br />\nUniversity President Steven Muller.<br />\nAnyone who has watched Muller's career<br />\nknows he has long fought for a less<br />\ntechnical, more broad-based medical and<br />\npre-medical education. Eliminating an<br />\narbitrary, computer-graded test that<br />\nfocuses only on the sciences obviously<br />\nfurthers those goals.<br />\nBut while Muller deserves a pat on the<br />\nback, he\u2014and, more importantly, the<br />\nmedical school faculty\u2014also deserves a<br />\nnudge in the rear. The May decision was<br />\na smart move, but a hesitant one. The<br />\nUnviersity must now take a much more<br />\nimportant step: the medical school<br />\nshould disregard the MCAT.<br />\nMuller says the test's problems are<br />\nquite specific: it focuses only on the<br />\nsciences. Throw in an essay and a section or two on history and English and<br />\nthe social sciences and everything will be<br />\nfine.<br />\nBut certainly the problems are much<br />\ndeeper than that. The idea that any single<br />\ntest can reasonably predict how good a<br />\nstudent (or a doctor) someone will be<br />\n(even if the test is used as one of several<br />\ncriteria) is absurd. After four years of<br />\ncollege, there must be far better ways of<br />\njudging a student's potential: an inter-<br />\n<br />\nview, his letters of recommendation, his<br />\ngrades. The MCAT is really as silly as<br />\nthe SAT,long ago held up as a ridiculous<br />\nanachronism.<br />\nAnd even if the MCAT can be saved,<br />\nhow long must we put up with it in its<br />\npresent form? Considering the speed<br />\nwith which the educational establishement tends to move, it could be years<br />\nbefore the MCAT is re-cast. Is the nation's most prestigious medical school to<br />\ngo on using a misguided test on the(problematical) assumption that it will someday be changed?<br />\nIt is true that a decision to ignore the<br />\nMCAT would have little praCtical effect<br />\nfor pre-meds, even as the decision to<br />\nmake it optional is essentially meaningless. Obviously, no student \u2014 no matter how precocious \u2014 can assume admission into Hopkins' medical school. Since<br />\nvirtually every other medical school in<br />\nthe country still requires the MCAT, premeds will still have to take it. Hopkins<br />\nmay no longer require the MCAT, but<br />\nreality does.<br />\nStill, disregarding the MCAT will accomplish something. It will make the<br />\nmedical school's admissions process far<br />\nmore rational.<br />\nMuller says it isn't his role as president<br />\nto suggest that the medical school<br />\ndisregard the MCAT. But it is his role<br />\nas president to lead the university, to improve the quality of the education offered here. Nothing could accomplish<br />\nthat more than urging the medical school<br />\nto ignore the MCAT.<br />\n<br />\nWJHU and Students<br />\nFinally, after months (years really) of<br />\nconfusion, rumors and indecision, it appears WJHU will indeed boost its power<br />\nto 25,000 watts.<br />\nThat in itself is certainly good, and<br />\nmost of the policies announced so far by<br />\nDavid Creagh, the new full-time professional General Manager, are reasonable.<br />\nOn one issue though, Creagh ought to<br />\nmoderate: he needs to specifically recruit<br />\nstudents for the station's part-time<br />\npositions.<br />\nCreagh says that he will, with only<br />\nthree exceptions, hire the best people<br />\navailable, whether or not they are<br />\nstudents. To do otherwise, he says,<br />\nwould be to compromise his commitment to excellence. He ought to compromise. A particular effort needs to be<br />\nmade to hire more students for the parttime staff.<br />\nCreagh must understand that while<br />\none of the goals for WJHU is certainly<br />\nto produce good programming, another<br />\n(equally important)goal is for it to function as a part of the university. And the<br />\nuniversity exists to train and educate<br />\nstudents. Making an extra effort to hire<br />\nstudents may make the station's pro-<br />\n<br />\ngramming slightly less superb, but so<br />\nlong as the station is funded by the<br />\nuniversity, which in turn is funded by<br />\nstudents, students have a right to expect<br />\nsome opportunities not available to<br />\neveryone else. That's why they pay<br />\n$10,000 a year. In fairness to Creagh, it<br />\nshould be mentioned that he hopes to<br />\nestablish an extensive training program<br />\nfor students. That's great, but no matter how wonderful the training, students<br />\ncan't reasonably be expected to compete<br />\nwith experienced professionals, even for<br />\npart-time positions.<br />\nOn other issues, however, Creagh has<br />\nsolid things to say. He is personally very<br />\nimpressive: extraordinarily up-front and<br />\nhonest. This causes him to say some<br />\nthings which some students may not like,<br />\nbut which are undoubtedly true. For example: rock will not be a major part of<br />\nthe station's programming because it's<br />\navailable on too many other stations.<br />\nHe's right, but it took courage to say it.<br />\nCreagh is generally off to a good start.<br />\nHe needs only to realize that as a part<br />\nof the university, WJHU must make an<br />\nextra effort to include students.<br />\n<br />\nby Paul Kadri<br />\nFor those I have not yet been<br />\nable to greet I want to welcome<br />\nyou back to Hopkins. My name<br />\nis Paul Kadri and I am the Student Council President for this<br />\nacademic year. The purpose of<br />\nthis article is to briefly inform<br />\nyou of my plans so you will<br />\nknow what to look for, and<br />\nhow you can help in the future.<br />\nMy goal for this year is to solve<br />\nthe problem of communication,<br />\nor lack thereof, and all the problems associated with it. I wish<br />\nto bring to Hopkins the \"small<br />\nschool\" unity, school spirit and<br />\nparticipation critical for an<br />\nundergraduate body as talented<br />\nas at Hopkins.<br />\nVery often this lack of communication has been associated<br />\nwith \"apathy.\" Upperclassmen, I am sure, know<br />\nwhat I am talking about. This<br />\nsummer we have set the<br />\ngroundwork to eliminate this<br />\nproblem. The following are<br />\nsome things to look out for.<br />\nFor those that take the<br />\nmeal plan, there will be an electronic L.E.D. message board to<br />\ninform you of events of importance (arriving soon in the Terrace room). If we can ever find<br />\na balloon that won't explode,<br />\nwe will send one up every time<br />\nthere is a big pavilion event. An<br />\ninformation bulletin should be<br />\nstarted within a couple of<br />\nweeks. We were successful in<br />\nmaking our first information<br />\nvideo (shown Thurs. at the<br />\nRat.) Finally, we received funding to expand the Peabody<br />\nshuttle. This is one of the many<br />\nways we hope to work much<br />\nmore closely with the other<br />\ndivisions of Hopkins.<br />\nHeading all these plans is the<br />\nStudent Council Communications Committee set up new this<br />\nyear. All you need to do is look<br />\nfor these forms of communication to find out what's going<br />\non. These plans were set up to<br />\nmake it easier for you to communicate to each other, as well<br />\nas for the Council, Administra-<br />\n<br />\ntion, and the Faculty to communicate to you.<br />\nTo solve the problems of<br />\ncommunication and apathy,<br />\nyour participation is very important. You are only here for<br />\nfour years. You can accomplish<br />\na lot or very little. It is a fact<br />\nthat you get out of the University as much as you put in. For<br />\nexample, in academics, if you<br />\ndon't study you are not going<br />\nto learn as much as if you did.<br />\nThis idea holds true for extracurriculars. If all you can<br />\ngive is academics, then that's<br />\nfine! However, I know there<br />\nare several hundred students<br />\ngifted in more than just<br />\nacademics. The undergraduate<br />\nbody as a whole needs the<br />\ntalents of all parts to be the best<br />\nit can. As corny as this sounds,<br />\nit is fact. My favorite example<br />\nof this is Orientation, where<br />\nseveral hundred upperclassmen<br />\nwork (and I mean work hard)<br />\nfor the benefit of the Freshmen.<br />\nYet they do it every year<br />\nbecause they have fun doing it.<br />\nWhile solving communication and apathy is far from the<br />\nonly thing that council will do<br />\nthis year, it is the foundation<br />\nthat finally must be set. I know<br />\nthere are people who will read<br />\nthis and doubt that anyone can<br />\nsolve these problems. Let me<br />\ntell you that I am committed to<br />\nsolve these problems along with<br />\na great council and council<br />\ncommittees. Add to that four<br />\ngreat classes and you have the<br />\nequipment necessary. All that is<br />\nneeded is a council to organize<br />\nand a student body with a<br />\npossitive attitude. We(council)<br />\nare there if you need help.<br />\nComing to us is better than giving up or complaining all the<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe problem with writing<br />\nthis article is that you can not<br />\nsee the determination in our<br />\neyes or hear the confidence in<br />\nour voices. Let me assure you<br />\nwe will stay that way until we<br />\nhave done what we set out to<br />\ndo.

Ten years<br />\nago, a 700-foot pole was affixed to Gilman Hall to allow<br />\ntaller buildings on the<br />\nHomewood Campus. The pole<br />\nwas necessary because of the<br />\nlong standing tradition that no<br />\nbuilding on campus may be<br />\ntaller than Gilman Hall. In the<br />\nnext ten years, four skyscrapers were conceived, the<br />\nGilman Towers, which are now<br />\nused as dormitories for the 3500<br />\nfreshmen. The four towers now<br />\nsurround Gilman Hall, bullies<br />\nthat hover over the wimpiness<br />\nof things past.<br />\n\u2022 \"John, are you going to the<br />\nLunar Rat tonight?\"<br />\n\"Sorry, Biff, but 1 can't.<br />\nThere is a study group at the<br />\nMSE on Level T.

I read about it in<br />\na yearbook from 2012. The administration wanted to use the<br />\nbuilding for storage, which had<br />\nuntil then been used as a place<br />\nfor studying and social gathering by the students. When the<br />\nadministration announced their<br />\nplans for Gilman Hall, the<br />\nstudents were furious. They<br />\n<br />\norganized the GILMAN PROTEST OF 2012. It was a major<br />\nsit-in on Gilman Quad.\"<br />\n\"But Gilman Quad is only 40<br />\nsquare feet! How could they fit<br />\nall of the students in?\"<br />\n\"It was a lot bigger then,<br />\nstupid.

The student<br />\nbody hasn't objected to<br />\nanything since.\"<br />\n\"Boy, we're really lucky to<br />\nhave an administration that<br />\ncares enough to make decisions<br />\nfor us so that we can spend<br />\nmore time studying.\"<br />\n\"You know, John, I think<br />\nyou're right.\"<br />\n<br />\nLetter Policy<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nThe<br />\nwelcomes letters to the<br />\neditor.

For<br />\nmy friends and family, it was a<br />\nsource of inscrutable evidence<br />\nthat I was in fact as lucky as<br />\nthey suspected. I was ranked<br />\ndown in my class, had just<br />\nflunked a creative writing<br />\ncourse (the core of my curriculum at Hopkins) and had<br />\npostitred a distinct apathy to<br />\nthe whole application process.<br />\nMy own surprise shook me<br />\nthese<br />\nfrom<br />\nsomewhat<br />\ndoldrums. I considered the<br />\nnews a remarkable instance of<br />\ngood timing--and a forbearance<br />\non my future. Of course, when<br />\nelse could such magnaminous<br />\nnews arrive, if not only a short<br />\nhour after the last high-school<br />\nclass of my life?<br />\nI had counted on admission<br />\nas a black sheep--my application package was mailed late, in<br />\na used manilla envelope, with<br />\nenough crossed-out blue ink<br />\nsplots to qualify for a<br />\nkindergarten painting of Lake<br />\nMichigan.

I<br />\n<br />\nthought it best to leave immediately Florida and begin<br />\ncomparison shopping. My<br />\nparents gave me enough money<br />\nto make it to Baltimore and<br />\nback. I didn't bother arguing,<br />\nI knewhow good Miami was--I<br />\nhad had their pictures on my<br />\nwall since November.<br />\nI was allowed to take two<br />\nfriends with me, and we left<br />\nearly Thursday morning and<br />\ndrove straight through to<br />\nBaltimore. We were making<br />\ngreat time--I must have drove<br />\n165 miles in two hours, when<br />\nour motel money burst along<br />\nwith our left rear tire. We lost<br />\nten minutes waiting for the tire<br />\nto cool enough to touch it, and<br />\nour motel money bought us a<br />\nnew spare.<br />\nWell, it couldn't have been<br />\nmuch more than what seemed<br />\nlike forty hours before we made<br />\nit to Baltimore. It was two in<br />\nthe morning, and I found a<br />\nbeautiful motel about a mile<br />\ndown the road from the jellowrestling bar on Pulaski<br />\nHighway. At the time, I was<br />\nunaware of such fine entertainment, and I asked the lady at<br />\nthe desk if she could recommend a nice fun place for funloving guys like us to grab a<br />\nbeer and meet some girls. At<br />\nher recommendation, and<br />\nfollowing her poor directions,<br />\nPhil, Don,and I tossed our luggage in the room, and we headed east back to town.<br />\nNow, I don't know what was<br />\nthat lady's cause of inspiration,<br />\nbut I suppose that I did not express my intentions too well.<br />\nAll through Baltimore, I asked<br />\nfor directions to the bars she<br />\nnamed, and each time, I got a<br />\n<br />\nstrange look, and I had to<br />\npote ntial<br />\neac<br />\nanswer<br />\nnavigator's query of what exactly was look ng for.<br />\n\"Well,\" I'd say, \"My<br />\nfriends and I just drove for<br />\nfourteen hours, and we want to<br />\nhave a few beers, work out a<br />\nfew kinks before we call it a<br />\nnight.

For you<br />\nsophomores, juniors and seniors, this is the start of<br />\nanother year at our fine institution. You probably hope<br />\nthis will be the one when you get the best grades, party the most, find yourself or just have a rip-roaring<br />\ngood time without screwing up. For you freshmen, this<br />\nis the beginning of a whole new life. Most of you may<br />\nnot be too sure what you want to do but almost all<br />\nof you want to enjoy yourselves doing it.<br />\nThe good times begin, and end for some, with<br />\nFreshman Orientation, that week so fresh in<br />\neverybody's minds when the whole Hopkins community lets loose. At many schools Freshman week is closed to non-freshmen. At Hopkins where there are only<br />\nabout 2500 students total, the motto is \"the more, the<br />\nmerrier\" at the big night events. Orientation is a fun<br />\nweek for everyone. Although many people venture into<br />\nthe catacombs of the library right after the first<br />\nsyllabus is passed out, this is the one week nobody has<br />\nan excuse to stay in and study.<br />\nNevertheless, all of the activities combined with<br />\nfreedom from parents and a dorm full of people<br />\naround one's own age make that first week particularly<br />\nexciting for freshmen. While upperclassmen usually<br />\nenjoy Orientation week, most of us tend to look back<br />\non that time when we were new to the place which has<br />\nsince become like home. With that in mind, I asked<br />\nfour people\u2014a freshman, a sophomore, a junior, and<br />\na senior\u2014to talk about their Orientations.<br />\nThe first orientation I'll talk about is Freshman<br />\nOrientation '85 because it's fresh in everyone's<br />\nmemories and the freshmen probably don't have the<br />\npatience to read this article all the way through. The<br />\nfreshman I talked to very much enjoyed the first week.<br />\nShe liked the Smile dance, the Motown dance, and the<br />\ncomedy show. She thought the square dance and the<br />\nbaseball game were boring. When I asked her where<br />\nshe had the best time, she said there was no particular<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/13<br />\n<br />\nIT A TION<br />\ntime or place which was special to her. What really<br />\nappealed to her was living with a large group of people whom she liked. She couldn't remember having any<br />\nbad times throughout the week.<br />\nJust for the order of things, I'm going to talk about<br />\nFreshman Orientation '84 next. The sophomore I talked to had enjoyed last year's Orientation. He didn't<br />\nenjoy the Smile dance because he didn't know anybody<br />\nwhen he went in and he didn't know many peoplc<br />\nwhen he left. He didn't have fun at the baseball gam(<br />\nor the New Wave dance.<br />\nThe best times he had were at the Motown danct<br />\nand the square dance because he met many people at<br />\nthose events. The worst times were when he missed hi<br />\ngirlfriend. His words were, \"My kingdom for a pa)<br />\nphone.\"<br />\nTwo years ago, I first came to Hopkins. I experienced fabulous highs and tremendous lows during my first<br />\nweek. The first dance made me feel very alone and the<br />\nMotown dance was so- hot I thought I was in a<br />\ngreenhouse. I really liked the square dancing and the<br />\nNew Wave dance. I thought the baseball game was<br />\nokay, but it wasn't the Mets.<br />\nMy best time was at the square dance and the crab<br />\nfeast\u2014it's a lot easier to meet people When you can<br />\nsee them and hear them. My worst times were when<br />\nI realized that I didn't have an identity anymore and<br />\nthat I'd have to make one up.<br />\nFinally, I talked to a senior who experienced Orientation '82. He had missed the first dance and he didn't<br />\nremember the Motown dance. He liked the square<br />\ndance and the Orioles' game because he's a baseball<br />\nfan. The best time he had was when he went to the<br />\nClub Charles and saw a band called Viscous Fluid. He<br />\nmissed his girlfriend during his worst times.<br />\nI think what meant most to people were the quiet<br />\ntimes between the \"events.\" The dining hall, the bus<br />\ntours, and the dorm hallways were where people really made their friends.

Breakey is<br />\nAssociate Professor of<br />\n<br />\nPsychiatry, and director of the<br />\nCommunity Psychiatry program at Hopkins. He and Dr.<br />\nPamela J.

It involves an extensive<br />\nsurvey of a sample of six hun-<br />\n<br />\ndred homeless people in<br />\nBaltimore. The second study,<br />\nwhich began last month, involves a census of the actual<br />\nnumber of people using shelters<br />\nand missions in Baltimore. A<br />\nthird study, the Health Care for<br />\nthe Homeless Project mentioned above, attempts to actually<br />\ndeliver needed mental and<br />\nphysical health care to these<br />\npeople.<br />\nThe first study will utilize<br />\nboth questionnaires and<br />\nphysical and psychiatric exams<br />\nto obtain a clear picture of the<br />\nhomeless population. Questions<br />\nwill concern age, sex, religion,<br />\nresidential history, and other<br />\ndemographic factors. Inquiries<br />\nwill also be made concerning<br />\nthe use of mental and physical<br />\nhealth services. Finally, a<br />\nscreening process will detect<br />\nmental disabilities,<br />\nOne major aim of this study<br />\nis to determine what the different subgroups of homeless<br />\npeople are. It has been<br />\npostulated that there is a<br />\n\"homeless culture\" that makes<br />\nup the street population.<br />\nBreakey and Fischer, however,<br />\nbelieve that there is enough<br />\ndiversity to warrant separate<br />\ncategorization,<br />\nMany street people, for instance, are alcohol abusers.

It is also<br />\nas yet unknown whether<br />\nalcohol abuse leads to<br />\nhomelessness, or whether it<br />\n<br />\nft<br />\n<br />\nresults from it.<br />\nAnother large subgroup is<br />\nthe \"situationally homeless,\"<br />\nthose who have lost their homes<br />\ndue to external circumstances.<br />\nThese include loss of a job, being evicted, wife abuse, or other<br />\nundesirable situations. These<br />\npeople are the easiest to help,<br />\nsince they tend to be younger,<br />\nand more in touch with the<br />\nmainstream of society.<br />\nThe homeless people who are<br />\nmentally ill are the most difficult to rehabilitate. It is<br />\nestimated that 1/.3 to /<br />\n1<br />\n2 of<br />\nAmerica's homeless population<br />\nhas some type of mental illness,<br />\nand an earlier study in<br />\nBaltimore showed that about 'A<br />\nof those have spent some time<br />\nin mental institutions.One goal<br />\nof these studies is to determine<br />\nhow much of the recent increase in homelessness is due to<br />\ndeinstitutionalization. Hundreds of people are released<br />\neach year from mental hospitals<br />\nand jails without adequate<br />\naftercare. Some of these people<br />\nhave no place to go, and end up<br />\non the streets.<br />\nThere is one more subgroup<br />\nof homeless people who are<br />\nalso very difficult to help but<br />\nfor different reasons. These are<br />\nthe genuine \"street people\"<br />\nwho have lived on the streets<br />\nfor much of their lives, are acclimated to street life, and may<br />\nnot wish to change their<br />\nlifestyles. Many of these people<br />\nwill refuse to stay in missions,<br />\n<br />\neven though they are well aware<br />\nthat these services exist.<br />\nThe major aim of the study<br />\nis to determine the actual mental and physical problems the<br />\nhomeless have in order to determine what services need to be<br />\nprovided.<br />\nThe homeless tend to have<br />\nmany of the same types of<br />\nphysical health problems as the<br />\ngeneral population but these are<br />\nexacerbated by being homeless.<br />\nThey are prone to heart problems, high blood pressure,<br />\ndiabetes, or other similar<br />\ndisorders just like the rest of the<br />\npopulation, but many have no<br />\ninsurance or Medicaid benefits<br />\nto cover the cost of medication<br />\nor doctors' visits. The homeless<br />\nare more prone to skin<br />\ndisorders, vascular diseases,<br />\nand infestations, just from living outdoors. Many are<br />\nmalnourished despite the<br />\navailability of decent meals in<br />\nsoup kitchens around the city.<br />\nThey are also more prone to<br />\nburns, heatstroke, frostbite,<br />\nanimal bites, and criminal<br />\nassaults.<br />\nThe final aim of the study is<br />\nto find out whether there are<br />\ncertain<br />\nprecursors<br />\nto<br />\nhomelessness, which can be<br />\nidentified early in an individual's lifetime. It seems that<br />\nmany homeless people are<br />\nsocially isolated, having formed few friends throughout their<br />\nlifetimes. Many are estranged<br />\nfrom their families, and a large<br />\nnumber have never been married.

Antonarakis, M.D.:<br />\nScientists take small blood<br />\nsamples from the mother to examine the two Factor VIII<br />\ngenes on her two Xchromosomes.(Every cell in the<br />\nbody carries copies of an individual's chromosomes.)They<br />\nlook for distinctive, normal<br />\nmarkers that have nothing to<br />\ndo with making Factor VIII but<br />\nlie near the mutations that alter<br />\nthe expression of the gene.<br />\nThey thus serve as markers to<br />\nhelp differentiate between the<br />\nnormal and the faulty genes.<br />\nThe scientists then take a<br />\nblood smaple from any of the<br />\nwoman's close relatives who<br />\nhas hemophilia\u2014her father, a<br />\nbrother, or a son. They search<br />\nfor markers on his single Xchromosome that match one of<br />\nthe mother's chromosomes.<br />\nDepending on which markers<br />\non one chromosome match his,<br />\nthe scientists know which of her<br />\nchromosomes carries the faulty gene, and therefore which<br />\nchromosome will pass on the<br />\ndisease.<br />\nThe next step is to find out<br />\nwhat kind of markers the<br />\nmother's unborn child has.

Sixteen of the<br />\ntwenty-eight players on the<br />\nroster are either freshmen or<br />\nsophomores. Head coach<br />\nWilliam Tierney feels that the<br />\nblend of youth and experience<br />\nthat the Jays possess should<br />\nenable them to compile an<br />\nabove-average season for the<br />\nfirst time in nearly a decade.<br />\n\"l'm extremely enthusiastic<br />\nabout the outlook for this<br />\nyear's season,\" the coach said.<br />\n\"This year's crop of freshmen<br />\nis a very experienced and<br />\ntalented one. They give us<br />\ntremendous depth, and enable<br />\nme to rotate the starters and<br />\nsubstitutes very frequently.\"<br />\nIn analyzing last season's<br />\n7-8-2 record, one must take into account that the Blue Jays<br />\nlost six contests on the road and<br />\nthree games by only a goal. The<br />\nmajority of the defeats in away<br />\ngames came on grass fields<br />\nwhich coach Tierney feels was<br />\na major disadvantage to the<br />\nteam.<br />\n\"We practice and play all our<br />\nhome games on artificial turf<br />\nwhich requires a much different<br />\nstyle of play than does a grass<br />\nfield,\" the coach noted.<br />\n\"Although our schedule this<br />\nyear is a very challenging one,<br />\nit features more away games on<br />\nturf, which should work in our<br />\nfavor.\"<br />\nSenior tri-captains Dave<br />\nGallo, Rob Nardino and Dan<br />\nOlszewski provide the Jays with<br />\nvaluable experience and will be<br />\nrelied upon heavily this seasons.<br />\nThe trio will team with Steve<br />\n<br />\nJess Bunshaft<br />\n<br />\nSenior Tri-Captains Dan Oszlewski, Rob Nardino and Dave Gallo head up a feisty midfield unit.<br />\n<br />\nGallo to form a potent midfield<br />\nattack.

Rather then hold<br />\non and take a 3-3 tie into the<br />\nnext period Krumenacker raced towards the net and blew one<br />\npast Nims with just four<br />\nseconds to go. It gave Hopkins<br />\na lead that they would never<br />\nrelinquish.<br />\nThe Jays added two more<br />\ngoals in the second quarter.<br />\nBrian Wood scored the first one<br />\non a breakaway, and Dressel<br />\nadded on his third tally of the<br />\nday to make it 6-3.<br />\nFor head coach Don Zimmerman, it was his second title<br />\nin as many years. His overall<br />\nrecord at Homewood now<br />\nstands at a lofty 27-1, including<br />\na perfect 3-0 against Syracuse.<br />\nThe unsung hero for<br />\nHopkins though would have to<br />\nbe Matthews. The nowgraduated specialist won 12 of<br />\n18 faceoffs against some tough<br />\nSyracuse opposition, providing<br />\nthe Jays with control of the ball<br />\nfor a majority of the contest.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/21<br />\n<br />\nGridders Grip High Hopes for Big Season<br />\nby Adam Warner<br />\n<br />\nTwo good ways to judge a<br />\ncollege team before the year<br />\nbegins are too look at how well<br />\nyou finished the season before<br />\nand to see how many of your<br />\nkey players return. If this is indeed true, then Hopkins looks<br />\nstrong in '85 as nearly everyone<br />\nis back from a sluggish 1-3 start<br />\nto win four of its last five<br />\ngames.<br />\nAccording to head coach<br />\nJerry Pfeifer, \"This team has a<br />\nlot of promise and a lot of<br />\npotential . . I'm especially<br />\npleased with how hard our<br />\nveterans worked in the off<br />\nseason and the condition that<br />\nthey reported to camp in.\"<br />\nBeginning on the right foot is<br />\n<br />\nessential this year if the Jays are<br />\nto make a run at the Centennial<br />\nConference crown. The campaign opens at home on<br />\nSeptember 21 against perennial<br />\npower and defending league<br />\nchamp Swarthmore and then<br />\ntwo weeks later they travel to<br />\nGettysburg to face another<br />\ntough conference foe.<br />\nLeading the team once again<br />\nwill be quarterback and cocaptain Mark Campbell, now in<br />\nhis fourth and final year at the<br />\nhelm. As a sophomore, Campbell led the division in pretty<br />\nmuch every passing category.<br />\nHe proceeded to follow that up<br />\nwith another brilliant year in<br />\n'84, hitting 116 of his 234<br />\nthrows for 1640 yards and 14<br />\nTD's.<br />\n<br />\nMost of his targets from last<br />\nyear are gone, with the notable<br />\nexceptions of junior tight end<br />\nChris Verica, and sophomore<br />\nwide receiver Tom Finegan.<br />\nThe offensive attack is by no<br />\nmeans unbalanced, however, as<br />\nthe running game looks powerful too. Co-captain Brad<br />\nMcLam comes back to start his<br />\nfourth year at fullback, where<br />\nhe is well within range of breaking all of the Blue Jay career<br />\nrushing records.<br />\nTony Nutter would have<br />\nbeen the halfback, but he chose<br />\nto sit out his senior season after<br />\nbeing a first tearner for his<br />\nwhole career. Fortunately,<br />\nPfeifer is loaded with backs to<br />\nreplace Nutter including<br />\nfreshmen David Goldman,<br />\n<br />\nChris Chairieleison, and Brian<br />\nDulin, and sophomore walk-on<br />\nDwain Irvin. According to the<br />\ncoach, \"This is the most 'quality' depth that we've had here in<br />\nthe backfield.\"<br />\nDefensively, Hopkins really<br />\ncame around in the second half<br />\nof 1984. In the last five contests, the Jays posted three<br />\nshutouts and a fourth game in<br />\nwhich they only yielded a field<br />\ngoal.<br />\nEight of the starters return,<br />\nincluding fifth year seniors Ritchie Schell and Ken Hirshman.<br />\nSchell, who will serve as cocaptain for the second year in<br />\na row, picked off five passes<br />\nlast year as Monster Back,<br />\nwhile Hirshman added four interceptions and a total of 99<br />\n<br />\ntackles as a cornerback.<br />\nOther key players on defense<br />\ninclude senior co-captain Jon<br />\nByrd (103 tackles, 61<br />\n/<br />\n2 sacks),<br />\nTom Kalup (all-conference<br />\ndefensive tackle), Jim Ryan (11<br />\nsacks) and nose tackle Kevin<br />\nTully.<br />\nTo warm up for the opener,<br />\nHopkins hosted Susquehanna<br />\nin a scrimmage last Saturday in<br />\nwhich no score was kept. The<br />\nJays held their own despite the<br />\nfact that Susquehanna used<br />\nmostly starters while Pfeifer<br />\nplayed his whole squad in the<br />\nbrutal heat.<br />\n<br />\n***********<br />\n<br />\nGet our new $49* software module<br />\nwhen you buy an HP-41.<br />\n<br />\nXd<br />\n<br />\ntOx<br />\n<br />\na\"<br />\n<br />\nLOG<br />\n<br />\nSIN<br />\n<br />\nCOS-1<br />\n<br />\nSIN<br />\n<br />\nCOS<br />\n<br />\nASN<br />\n<br />\nLSI<br />\n<br />\nGTO<br />\n<br />\nXEO<br />\n<br />\nSTO<br />\n<br />\nRCL<br />\n<br />\nCATALOG<br />\n<br />\nISO<br />\n<br />\nENTER +<br />\n<br />\nCHS<br />\n<br />\nIt's a deal that has no equal, for a calculator that has<br />\nno equal.<br />\nOur new HP-41 Advantage software module packs<br />\n12K of ROM.One and a half times the capacity of any<br />\nother HP-41 module.

One point Creagh stresses,<br />\nhowever, is that the material<br />\nmust have wide, general appeal.<br />\nMuller said WJHU's format<br />\nwill probably consist largely of<br />\nclassical music and jazz.<br /><br />\n\"The consensus is that we<br />\nwill want a station that will<br />\nfeature classical music and a<br />\nvery strong public affairs component,\" Muller said. \"In<br />\norder to develop an audience<br />\nany station has to have an image, and we will have a classical<br />\nmusic/public affairs image and<br />\na very strong public affairs<br />\nimage.\"<br />\nMuller also said the station<br />\nwill \"obviously\" broadcast<br />\nHopkins lacrosse.<br />\nWhen asked if that meant<br />\nbroadcasting lacrosse was<br />\n\"definite,\" Muller laughed and<br />\nsaid it did not.<br />\n\"If somebody makes a<br />\npowerful case against it, I will<br />\nlook at it, but it would surprise<br />\nme\" if the station didn't broadcast lacrosse, Muller said.<br />\nCreagh spent time this summer studying market information and data on the listening<br />\nhabits of listeners of 12<br />\nBaltimore stations. He concluded that \"Baltimore remains an<br />\nunderdeveloped public radio<br />\nlistening audience. There is untapped market potential.\"<br />\nThough Creagh says a commitment to a large, general audience is important to.<br />\nestablishing a self-sufficient station, he believes \"a radio station can't be all things to all<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nCommenting<br />\non<br />\n\"hodgepodge\" programming<br />\nthat attempts to cater to<br /><br />\neveryone's interests, Creagh<br />\nsaid, \"It has been proven that<br />\nstations that are most likely to<br />\nfail have not succeeded in satisfying a large listening<br />\naudience.\"<br />\nCreagh intends to attract a<br />\nfaithful listening audience by<br />\navoiding hodgepodge programming and targeting the broadcasts to well educated people.<br />\nAccording to Creagh,\"People of high educational<br />\nbackgrounds are those who<br />\nsupport a public radio station,<br />\nand not necessarily those of<br />\nhigh income... .

Asia<br />\nThe new Homewood dog<br />\npolicy, made effective July,<br />\n1985, was created by the deans<br />\nand administrators as a \"liberal<br />\npolicy\" according to Chris Colombo, Dean of Students, in<br />\nresponse to the dog population<br />\non campus. The four item<br />\npolicy requires dogs on University property to be licensed,<br />\nleashed, and under the control<br />\nof their owners.<br />\nThe policy was instigated by<br />\n\"constant complaints\" of dogs<br />\nloose or tied to trees during inclement weather while their<br />\nowners were in class. Several<br />\npeople were also attacked by<br />\ndogs on campus last year. To<br />\nColombo's knowledge, no ac-<br /><br />\ntion has been taken against the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe idea behind the policy is<br />\nto force owners to take responsible action in regards to their<br />\ndogs. This is not meant to stop<br />\ndogs from exercising on campus grounds or chasing frisbees.<br />\nIf the owner is suitably confident that the animal is under his<br />\ncontrol while loose, it may go<br />\nabout leashless in the owner's<br />\npresence.

Among the measures<br />\ntaken were a fostering of<br />\nregional common markets,<br />\nestablishment of study groups<br />\non Latin American commodities, and the Inter<br /><br />\nAmerica bank.

So, that is<br />\nabout eight times the size of<br />\nHopkins, although the faculty<br />\nis only about four times as<br />\nlarge.

So the ways in<br />\nwhich the institutions are<br />\nfinanced are very much different. I come from a highly<br />\nbureaucratized state system not<br />\njust within the state levels of<br />\neducation but just within the<br />\nentire state system per se. There<br />\nare an incredible number of<br />\nrules and regulations. The code<br />\nof student conduct, for example, runs three to four hundred<br />\npages.

The key question now: will it<br />\nfollow through?<br />\nThe decision to drop the MCAT, the<br />\nstandard medical school admissions test,<br />\nas a requirement was clearly a victory for<br />\nUniversity President Steven Muller.<br />\nAnyone who has watched Muller's career<br />\nknows he has long fought for a less<br />\ntechnical, more broad-based medical and<br />\npre-medical education. Eliminating an<br />\narbitrary, computer-graded test that<br />\nfocuses only on the sciences obviously<br />\nfurthers those goals.<br />\nBut while Muller deserves a pat on the<br />\nback, he\u2014and, more importantly, the<br />\nmedical school faculty\u2014also deserves a<br />\nnudge in the rear. The May decision was<br />\na smart move, but a hesitant one. The<br />\nUnviersity must now take a much more<br />\nimportant step: the medical school<br />\nshould disregard the MCAT.<br />\nMuller says the test's problems are<br />\nquite specific: it focuses only on the<br />\nsciences. Throw in an essay and a section or two on history and English and<br />\nthe social sciences and everything will be<br />\nfine.<br />\nBut certainly the problems are much<br />\ndeeper than that. The idea that any single<br />\ntest can reasonably predict how good a<br />\nstudent (or a doctor) someone will be<br />\n(even if the test is used as one of several<br />\ncriteria) is absurd. After four years of<br />\ncollege, there must be far better ways of<br />\njudging a student's potential: an inter-<br /><br />\nview, his letters of recommendation, his<br />\ngrades. The MCAT is really as silly as<br />\nthe SAT,long ago held up as a ridiculous<br />\nanachronism.<br />\nAnd even if the MCAT can be saved,<br />\nhow long must we put up with it in its<br />\npresent form? Considering the speed<br />\nwith which the educational establishement tends to move, it could be years<br />\nbefore the MCAT is re-cast. Is the nation's most prestigious medical school to<br />\ngo on using a misguided test on the(problematical) assumption that it will someday be changed?<br />\nIt is true that a decision to ignore the<br />\nMCAT would have little praCtical effect<br />\nfor pre-meds, even as the decision to<br />\nmake it optional is essentially meaningless. Obviously, no student \u2014 no matter how precocious \u2014 can assume admission into Hopkins' medical school. Since<br />\nvirtually every other medical school in<br />\nthe country still requires the MCAT, premeds will still have to take it. Hopkins<br />\nmay no longer require the MCAT, but<br />\nreality does.<br />\nStill, disregarding the MCAT will accomplish something. It will make the<br />\nmedical school's admissions process far<br />\nmore rational.<br />\nMuller says it isn't his role as president<br />\nto suggest that the medical school<br />\ndisregard the MCAT. But it is his role<br />\nas president to lead the university, to improve the quality of the education offered here. Nothing could accomplish<br />\nthat more than urging the medical school<br />\nto ignore the MCAT.<br /><br />\nWJHU and Students<br />\nFinally, after months (years really) of<br />\nconfusion, rumors and indecision, it appears WJHU will indeed boost its power<br />\nto 25,000 watts.<br />\nThat in itself is certainly good, and<br />\nmost of the policies announced so far by<br />\nDavid Creagh, the new full-time professional General Manager, are reasonable.<br />\nOn one issue though, Creagh ought to<br />\nmoderate: he needs to specifically recruit<br />\nstudents for the station's part-time<br />\npositions.<br />\nCreagh says that he will, with only<br />\nthree exceptions, hire the best people<br />\navailable, whether or not they are<br />\nstudents. To do otherwise, he says,<br />\nwould be to compromise his commitment to excellence. He ought to compromise. A particular effort needs to be<br />\nmade to hire more students for the parttime staff.<br />\nCreagh must understand that while<br />\none of the goals for WJHU is certainly<br />\nto produce good programming, another<br />\n(equally important)goal is for it to function as a part of the university. And the<br />\nuniversity exists to train and educate<br />\nstudents. Making an extra effort to hire<br />\nstudents may make the station's pro-<br /><br />\ngramming slightly less superb, but so<br />\nlong as the station is funded by the<br />\nuniversity, which in turn is funded by<br />\nstudents, students have a right to expect<br />\nsome opportunities not available to<br />\neveryone else. That's why they pay<br />\n$10,000 a year. In fairness to Creagh, it<br />\nshould be mentioned that he hopes to<br />\nestablish an extensive training program<br />\nfor students. That's great, but no matter how wonderful the training, students<br />\ncan't reasonably be expected to compete<br />\nwith experienced professionals, even for<br />\npart-time positions.<br />\nOn other issues, however, Creagh has<br />\nsolid things to say. He is personally very<br />\nimpressive: extraordinarily up-front and<br />\nhonest. This causes him to say some<br />\nthings which some students may not like,<br />\nbut which are undoubtedly true. For example: rock will not be a major part of<br />\nthe station's programming because it's<br />\navailable on too many other stations.<br />\nHe's right, but it took courage to say it.<br />\nCreagh is generally off to a good start.<br />\nHe needs only to realize that as a part<br />\nof the university, WJHU must make an<br />\nextra effort to include students.<br /><br />\nby Paul Kadri<br />\nFor those I have not yet been<br />\nable to greet I want to welcome<br />\nyou back to Hopkins. My name<br />\nis Paul Kadri and I am the Student Council President for this<br />\nacademic year. The purpose of<br />\nthis article is to briefly inform<br />\nyou of my plans so you will<br />\nknow what to look for, and<br />\nhow you can help in the future.<br />\nMy goal for this year is to solve<br />\nthe problem of communication,<br />\nor lack thereof, and all the problems associated with it. I wish<br />\nto bring to Hopkins the \"small<br />\nschool\" unity, school spirit and<br />\nparticipation critical for an<br />\nundergraduate body as talented<br />\nas at Hopkins.<br />\nVery often this lack of communication has been associated<br />\nwith \"apathy.\" Upperclassmen, I am sure, know<br />\nwhat I am talking about. This<br />\nsummer we have set the<br />\ngroundwork to eliminate this<br />\nproblem. The following are<br />\nsome things to look out for.<br />\nFor those that take the<br />\nmeal plan, there will be an electronic L.E.D. message board to<br />\ninform you of events of importance (arriving soon in the Terrace room). If we can ever find<br />\na balloon that won't explode,<br />\nwe will send one up every time<br />\nthere is a big pavilion event. An<br />\ninformation bulletin should be<br />\nstarted within a couple of<br />\nweeks. We were successful in<br />\nmaking our first information<br />\nvideo (shown Thurs. at the<br />\nRat.) Finally, we received funding to expand the Peabody<br />\nshuttle. This is one of the many<br />\nways we hope to work much<br />\nmore closely with the other<br />\ndivisions of Hopkins.<br />\nHeading all these plans is the<br />\nStudent Council Communications Committee set up new this<br />\nyear. All you need to do is look<br />\nfor these forms of communication to find out what's going<br />\non. These plans were set up to<br />\nmake it easier for you to communicate to each other, as well<br />\nas for the Council, Administra-<br /><br />\ntion, and the Faculty to communicate to you.<br />\nTo solve the problems of<br />\ncommunication and apathy,<br />\nyour participation is very important. You are only here for<br />\nfour years. You can accomplish<br />\na lot or very little. It is a fact<br />\nthat you get out of the University as much as you put in. For<br />\nexample, in academics, if you<br />\ndon't study you are not going<br />\nto learn as much as if you did.<br />\nThis idea holds true for extracurriculars. If all you can<br />\ngive is academics, then that's<br />\nfine! However, I know there<br />\nare several hundred students<br />\ngifted in more than just<br />\nacademics. The undergraduate<br />\nbody as a whole needs the<br />\ntalents of all parts to be the best<br />\nit can. As corny as this sounds,<br />\nit is fact.

Ten years<br />\nago, a 700-foot pole was affixed to Gilman Hall to allow<br />\ntaller buildings on the<br />\nHomewood Campus. The pole<br />\nwas necessary because of the<br />\nlong standing tradition that no<br />\nbuilding on campus may be<br />\ntaller than Gilman Hall. In the<br />\nnext ten years, four skyscrapers were conceived, the<br />\nGilman Towers, which are now<br />\nused as dormitories for the 3500<br />\nfreshmen. The four towers now<br />\nsurround Gilman Hall, bullies<br />\nthat hover over the wimpiness<br />\nof things past.<br />\n\u2022 \"John, are you going to the<br />\nLunar Rat tonight?\"<br />\n\"Sorry, Biff, but 1 can't.<br />\nThere is a study group at the<br />\nMSE on Level T.

When the<br />\nadministration announced their<br />\nplans for Gilman Hall, the<br />\nstudents were furious. They<br /><br />\norganized the GILMAN PROTEST OF 2012. It was a major<br />\nsit-in on Gilman Quad.\"<br />\n\"But Gilman Quad is only 40<br />\nsquare feet!

For<br />\nmy friends and family, it was a<br />\nsource of inscrutable evidence<br />\nthat I was in fact as lucky as<br />\nthey suspected.

For you<br />\nsophomores, juniors and seniors, this is the start of<br />\nanother year at our fine institution. You probably hope<br />\nthis will be the one when you get the best grades, party the most, find yourself or just have a rip-roaring<br />\ngood time without screwing up. For you freshmen, this<br />\nis the beginning of a whole new life. Most of you may<br />\nnot be too sure what you want to do but almost all<br />\nof you want to enjoy yourselves doing it.<br />\nThe good times begin, and end for some, with<br />\nFreshman Orientation, that week so fresh in<br />\neverybody's minds when the whole Hopkins community lets loose. At many schools Freshman week is closed to non-freshmen. At Hopkins where there are only<br />\nabout 2500 students total, the motto is \"the more, the<br />\nmerrier\" at the big night events. Orientation is a fun<br />\nweek for everyone. Although many people venture into<br />\nthe catacombs of the library right after the first<br />\nsyllabus is passed out, this is the one week nobody has<br />\nan excuse to stay in and study.<br />\nNevertheless, all of the activities combined with<br />\nfreedom from parents and a dorm full of people<br />\naround one's own age make that first week particularly<br />\nexciting for freshmen. While upperclassmen usually<br />\nenjoy Orientation week, most of us tend to look back<br />\non that time when we were new to the place which has<br />\nsince become like home. With that in mind, I asked<br />\nfour people\u2014a freshman, a sophomore, a junior, and<br />\na senior\u2014to talk about their Orientations.<br />\nThe first orientation I'll talk about is Freshman<br />\nOrientation '85 because it's fresh in everyone's<br />\nmemories and the freshmen probably don't have the<br />\npatience to read this article all the way through. The<br />\nfreshman I talked to very much enjoyed the first week.<br />\nShe liked the Smile dance, the Motown dance, and the<br />\ncomedy show. She thought the square dance and the<br />\nbaseball game were boring. When I asked her where<br />\nshe had the best time, she said there was no particular<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/13<br /><br />\nIT A TION<br />\ntime or place which was special to her. What really<br />\nappealed to her was living with a large group of people whom she liked. She couldn't remember having any<br />\nbad times throughout the week.<br />\nJust for the order of things, I'm going to talk about<br />\nFreshman Orientation '84 next. The sophomore I talked to had enjoyed last year's Orientation. He didn't<br />\nenjoy the Smile dance because he didn't know anybody<br />\nwhen he went in and he didn't know many peoplc<br />\nwhen he left. He didn't have fun at the baseball gam(<br />\nor the New Wave dance.<br />\nThe best times he had were at the Motown danct<br />\nand the square dance because he met many people at<br />\nthose events. The worst times were when he missed hi<br />\ngirlfriend. His words were, \"My kingdom for a pa)<br />\nphone.\"<br />\nTwo years ago, I first came to Hopkins. I experienced fabulous highs and tremendous lows during my first<br />\nweek. The first dance made me feel very alone and the<br />\nMotown dance was so- hot I thought I was in a<br />\ngreenhouse. I really liked the square dancing and the<br />\nNew Wave dance. I thought the baseball game was<br />\nokay, but it wasn't the Mets.<br />\nMy best time was at the square dance and the crab<br />\nfeast\u2014it's a lot easier to meet people When you can<br />\nsee them and hear them. My worst times were when<br />\nI realized that I didn't have an identity anymore and<br />\nthat I'd have to make one up.<br />\nFinally, I talked to a senior who experienced Orientation '82. He had missed the first dance and he didn't<br />\nremember the Motown dance. He liked the square<br />\ndance and the Orioles' game because he's a baseball<br />\nfan. The best time he had was when he went to the<br />\nClub Charles and saw a band called Viscous Fluid. He<br />\nmissed his girlfriend during his worst times.<br />\nI think what meant most to people were the quiet<br />\ntimes between the \"events.\" The dining hall, the bus<br />\ntours, and the dorm hallways were where people really made their friends. The real joy of Orientation is<br />\nin meeting new people. Too bad that knowing some<br />\nof them isn't as much fun.<br /><br />\n4/S<br /><br />\n:graduates will receive individualized instruction in using appropriate reference sources to research specific<br />\nterm paper topics.<br />\nStudents nia\\ ree.ister for these sessions at the<br />\nReference Desk, NI level, 1S1-1 , or in the 1-1titiler<br />\nUndergraduate I.ihrar, Gilman Hall.<br /><br />\nUse the plastic bags available at the Circulation<br />\nDesk to protect books from rain and snow;<br />\nUse books sensibly outside the Library;<br /><br />\nCURRENT PERIODICALS<br /><br />\nBring to the attention of staff, books in damaged<br />\ncondition and in particular, bring to the attention of<br />\nCirculation staff books which are being returned to the<br />\nLibrary in poor condition.<br /><br />\nAUDIO-VISUAL DEPARTMENT<br /><br />\nFor further intormation, contact the Reference<br />\nstaff at 338-8135.<br /><br />\nA Level<br />\n338-8353<br /><br />\nThe Library also has subscriptions to approximately fifty U.S. and foreign newspapers.

Everyone seemed to go<br />\nhome happy. But the memories<br />\nof their last Washington show<br />\nwere not completely forgotten.<br />\nBassist Peter Hook had a few<br />\ndrinks too many and slept<br />\nthrough the beginning of the<br />\nshow. When he finally did<br />\ncome on, he hurled some choice<br />\ninsults at the audience, and the<br />\nshow itself was disappointingly lackluster. One expects<br />\nsomething better from a bunch<br />\nof cult heroes.<br />\nNew Order's lead singer,<br />\nBernard Sumner, sits perched<br />\non the edge of the toilet seat of<br />\nthe Warner Theater's backstage<br /><br />\nBernie Sumner (ex Albrect), the<br />\nlead singer and guitarist.<br /><br />\nbathroom, prepared to explain<br />\nit all.

Although it's<br />\nnot at all obvious from the<br />\nsmooth synthesizers that<br />\nhighlight their songs these days,<br />\nNew Order were around in the<br />\nearly days of punk. They were<br />\ncalled Joy Division then, and<br />\ntheir music was a vehicle for the<br />\nvisions of Ian Curtis, a young<br />\nman whose lyrics were<br />\ndominated by a haunting<br />\nsadness, a sense of helplessness,<br />\nof hopelessness.<br />\nJoy Division created two<br />\nstunning LPs and a few singles,<br />\nincluding the transcendant<br />\n\"Love Will Tear Us Apart,\"<br />\nperhaps their greatest achievement, and unfortunately their<br />\nlast.

But<br />\nthings began to change as New<br />\nOrder released more and more<br />\nrecords. Temptation hinted at<br />\nthings to come, but it was \"Blue<br />\nMonday\" which really introduced an industrial strength dance<br />\nbeat into their music. Future<br />\nreleases repeated that track's<br />\ndance-club success, and their<br />\nnew album Low Life, is practically joyful\u2014at one point,<br />\nSumner even sings \"Let's go<br />\nout and have some fun!\" like<br />\nhe means it.<br />\nWith so many years behind<br />\nthem, it's not that surprising<br />\nthat New Order has such an immensely loyal cult following.<br />\nSumner, however, is not willing<br />\nto speculate as to whether or<br />\nnot this has anything to do with<br />\ntheir tumultous past, and the<br />\nmyth that has grown up around<br />\nIan Curtis' history.<br />\n\"I don't, know,\" he says.<br />\n\"You'd have to ask the fans<br />\nabout that. But hopefully, it's<br />\nthe integrity.\"<br />\n\"Integrity\" is a continuing<br />\ntheme in Sumner's conversation. He claims that he, and the<br />\nother members of New Order,<br />\ndon't care about success,<br />\nmonetary or otherwise.<br />\n\"We got into this because we<br /><br />\nlike music. It doesn't make any<br />\ndifference to me if we're successful. There is a commercial<br />\nside to music, but I don't know<br />\nenough to comment about it.\"<br />\nBut New Order is winning<br />\nmore and more fans with its<br />\nsound, and there are probably<br />\nplenty of people today snapping up copies of Low Life who<br />\nion't even know what Joy<br />\nDivision was.

Like<br />\nthe other well-known acts on<br />\nBritain's Zang Tumb Tuum<br />\nRecords, Frankie Goes to<br />\nHollywood and Art of Noise,<br />\nPropaganda relies on a barrage<br />\nof synthesized sounds to create<br />\nan impressive wall of noise.<br />\nZTT Records are the musical<br />\nequivalents of films like Indiana Jones and the Temple of<br />\nDoom, out to wow you with<br />\nfabulous special effects that<br />\nmay sometimes seem to be taking the place of substance. A<br />\nsimulated thunderstorm here,<br />\nand orchestral blast of strings<br />\nthere\u2014ZTT Productions have<br />\nall the subtlety of a sonic boom.<br />\nBut behind the quartet of<br />\nscowling Germans on the cover<br />\nof A Secret Wish lurks a true<br />\npop sensibility, the suggestion<br />\nthat perhaps the works of Abba were on their turntables between plays of The 1812 Overture. In fact, the dazzling<br /><br />\ndecibels of this LP probably<br />\nhave more to do with S.J. Lipson's production and Trevor<br />\nHorn's \"mixing and matching\"<br />\n(his cover credit) than Propaganda themselves. As was the<br />\ncase with Frankie Goes to<br />\nHollywood, the line between<br />\nthe producer and the produced<br />\nbecomes hopelessly blurred,<br />\nsetting the stage for all manner<br />\nof suspicious queries\u2014Are they<br />\nreally playing their own instruments? How much input<br />\ndid Propaganda have into the<br />\nmaking of their record? To further complicate matters, their<br />\nlead singer is none other than<br />\nthe wife of Paul Morley, ZTT's<br />\nmastermind/publicist.<br />\nMost of A Secret Wish,<br />\nhowever, has real substance<br />\nbacking up the bombast. It's<br />\nnot too hard to imagine Tears<br />\nfor Fears doing, say, Duel, a<br />\nmelodic delight. Also sporting<br />\nsolid tunes as well as solid beats<br />\nare The Chase, The Murder of<br />\nLove, and the sublime Sorryfor<br />\nLaughing, a cover version of a<br />\nsong originally done by the<br />\noverlooked Scottish band Josef<br />\nDream within a Dream is less<br />\nsuccessful. It is a long,<br />\noverture-like piece much like<br />\nFrankie Goes to Hollywood's<br />\nside-long album opener,<br />\nWelcome to the Pleasuredome,<br />\nand it is reprised in A Secret<br />\nWish's last track,Strength to<br />\nDream. This conceptual trick<br />\nmakes one wonder if ZTT's<br />\nHorn sees his productions as<br /><br />\nlavish musicals ready to take<br />\nthe stage.<br />\nDespite these larger-than-life<br />\npretensions, there is much to<br />\nlike about A Secret Wish. Dr.<br />\nMabuse, with its engaging introductory phrase,\"Why does it<br />\nhurt when my heart misses the<br />\nbeat?\" is a definite winner with<br />\nits sinuously funky rhythm.<br /><br />\nAnd Jewel, Deul's raucous<br />\nrough-cut twin, spotlight's Propaganda's wild side. Still, it<br />\nwould have been nice to have<br />\nsegued Jewel right into Dewel, to<br />\nfurther drive home the band's<br />\nversatility and way with a<br />\nremix.<br />\nUnlike Frankie Goes to<br />\nHollywood, whose image prac-<br /><br />\ntically overshadows their music,<br />\nPropaganda has no notoriety to<br />\nspeak of, although ZTT seems<br />\nto be doing its best to give them<br />\na racy S&amp;M type appeal.

These are<br />\nthe so-called \"street people\" of<br />\nBaltimore, and their numbers<br />\nseem to be increasing<br />\nsignificantly in recent years.<br />\nTwo Hopkins researchers are<br />\nnow attempting to discover the<br />\nreason for this, and what can be<br />\ndone to help them.<br />\nDr. William R. Breakey is<br />\nAssociate Professor of<br /><br />\nPsychiatry, and director of the<br />\nCommunity Psychiatry program at Hopkins. He and Dr.<br />\nPamela J. Fischer, Assistant<br />\nProfessor of Psychiatry, are the<br />\nprincipal investigators in two<br />\nrelated studies involving the<br />\nhomeless in Baltimore and are<br />\ninvolved with the Robert Wood<br />\nMemorial<br />\nJohnson\u2014Pew<br />\nHealth Care for the Homeless<br />\nproject.<br />\nThe first study, which began<br />\nin June, has been funded for<br />\ntwo and a,half years by the National Institute of Mental<br />\nHealth. It involves an extensive<br />\nsurvey of a sample of six hun-<br /><br />\ndred homeless people in<br />\nBaltimore. The second study,<br />\nwhich began last month, involves a census of the actual<br />\nnumber of people using shelters<br />\nand missions in Baltimore. A<br />\nthird study, the Health Care for<br />\nthe Homeless Project mentioned above, attempts to actually<br />\ndeliver needed mental and<br />\nphysical health care to these<br />\npeople.<br />\nThe first study will utilize<br />\nboth questionnaires and<br />\nphysical and psychiatric exams<br />\nto obtain a clear picture of the<br />\nhomeless population. Questions<br />\nwill concern age, sex, religion,<br />\nresidential history, and other<br />\ndemographic factors. Inquiries<br />\nwill also be made concerning<br />\nthe use of mental and physical<br />\nhealth services. Finally, a<br />\nscreening process will detect<br />\nmental disabilities,<br />\nOne major aim of this study<br />\nis to determine what the different subgroups of homeless<br />\npeople are. It has been<br />\npostulated that there is a<br />\n\"homeless culture\" that makes<br />\nup the street population.<br />\nBreakey and Fischer, however,<br />\nbelieve that there is enough<br />\ndiversity to warrant separate<br />\ncategorization,<br />\nMany street people, for instance, are alcohol abusers. Exact percentages, however, have<br />\nyet to be determined. It is also<br />\nas yet unknown whether<br />\nalcohol abuse leads to<br />\nhomelessness, or whether it<br /><br />\nft<br /><br />\nresults from it.<br />\nAnother large subgroup is<br />\nthe \"situationally homeless,\"<br />\nthose who have lost their homes<br />\ndue to external circumstances.<br />\nThese include loss of a job, being evicted, wife abuse, or other<br />\nundesirable situations. These<br />\npeople are the easiest to help,<br />\nsince they tend to be younger,<br />\nand more in touch with the<br />\nmainstream of society.<br />\nThe homeless people who are<br />\nmentally ill are the most difficult to rehabilitate. It is<br />\nestimated that 1/.3 to /<br />\n1<br />\n2 of<br />\nAmerica's homeless population<br />\nhas some type of mental illness,<br />\nand an earlier study in<br />\nBaltimore showed that about 'A<br />\nof those have spent some time<br />\nin mental institutions.One goal<br />\nof these studies is to determine<br />\nhow much of the recent increase in homelessness is due to<br />\ndeinstitutionalization. Hundreds of people are released<br />\neach year from mental hospitals<br />\nand jails without adequate<br />\naftercare. Some of these people<br />\nhave no place to go, and end up<br />\non the streets.<br />\nThere is one more subgroup<br />\nof homeless people who are<br />\nalso very difficult to help but<br />\nfor different reasons. These are<br />\nthe genuine \"street people\"<br />\nwho have lived on the streets<br />\nfor much of their lives, are acclimated to street life, and may<br />\nnot wish to change their<br />\nlifestyles. Many of these people<br />\nwill refuse to stay in missions,<br /><br />\neven though they are well aware<br />\nthat these services exist.<br />\nThe major aim of the study<br />\nis to determine the actual mental and physical problems the<br />\nhomeless have in order to determine what services need to be<br />\nprovided.<br />\nThe homeless tend to have<br />\nmany of the same types of<br />\nphysical health problems as the<br />\ngeneral population but these are<br />\nexacerbated by being homeless.<br />\nThey are prone to heart problems, high blood pressure,<br />\ndiabetes, or other similar<br />\ndisorders just like the rest of the<br />\npopulation, but many have no<br />\ninsurance or Medicaid benefits<br />\nto cover the cost of medication<br />\nor doctors' visits. The homeless<br />\nare more prone to skin<br />\ndisorders, vascular diseases,<br />\nand infestations, just from living outdoors. Many are<br />\nmalnourished despite the<br />\navailability of decent meals in<br />\nsoup kitchens around the city.<br />\nThey are also more prone to<br />\nburns, heatstroke, frostbite,<br />\nanimal bites, and criminal<br />\nassaults.<br />\nThe final aim of the study is<br />\nto find out whether there are<br />\ncertain<br />\nprecursors<br />\nto<br />\nhomelessness, which can be<br />\nidentified early in an individual's lifetime. It seems that<br />\nmany homeless people are<br />\nsocially isolated, having formed few friends throughout their<br />\nlifetimes. Many are estranged<br />\nfrom their families, and a large<br />\nnumber have never been married. Contrary to popular<br />\nstereotypes, street people don't<br />\nusually band together in<br />\nof<br />\nscientists<br />\nuse<br />\none<br />\nthe<br />\ndo that,<br />\ntwo techniques.
