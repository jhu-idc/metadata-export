This, indeed, seems to be d very good custom, and has many advantages. In the first<br />\nplace, the freshmen, recognizing a leader, all come to the meeting; in the second place, the<br />\nfreshmen are made to keep quiet and consequently consider the merits of the candidates; and,<br />\nlast of all, the rules of order are strictly observed.<br />\nNow, if in the future the upper classmen at Hopkins are to assume more dignity and<br />\nresponsibility, it seems that the introduction of this custom might form a good beginning.<br />\n<br />\nreading the local dailies of the last few weeks<br />\nYt. VERVONE who has been<br />\n<br />\nhas doubtless noticed how little space some of them are giving to<br />\nHopkins football news. The American and the Star are served by<br />\ntwo very efficient correspondents among the students, and consequently they have been giving plenty of news; but it is a rare thing<br />\nto see more than two or three paragraphs on the next game in the<br />\nNews or the Sun. Walbrook, Mt. Washington and the other athletic<br />\n241<br />\n\u2022 Igg,gggggggg Intj \u2022<br />\nclubs can have all the space they want. One day the Sun gave nearly<br />\na column to a City College game, detailing every play, while the<br />\nonly reference to Hopkins in that issue was a four-line paragraph.<br />\nThis is the very time we need such advertising. The team is doing splendidly; the<br />\nbest part of the season is yet to come; and the big reunion will soon come off, when we want<br />\nto pack the grandstand and all the standing-room, too. It's up to the Hopkins correspondents<br />\nof these papers to get busy- at once, or to turn over their jobs to those who will get<br />\nbusy.<br />\n<br />\nHAT Hopkins is going to have its First General Reunion this fall,<br />\nliaitis<br />\nit r<br />\nhas aroused a great deal of interest, not only among the students,<br />\nsi,: trrrifrrrrrlc<br />\nw<br />\nbut all over Baltimore and even farther. Invitations have been sent<br />\nV<br />\nr<br />\nto every man, now living, who has ever studied at Hopkins, and<br />\n\u2713 4S 1<br />\nr\u2022<br />\na large crowd is expected. Each old class will meet at the Hopkins<br />\n\u2713.<br />\nv<br />\nClub, on Thursday night, November 19th.

Every one should make it a point to be present at the<br />\ngame and to aid in the rooting.<br />\nMr. Paul Dashiell, the famous football man, has sent word that he can be counted upon<br />\nin every way, and this is the general tone of all the responses from the alumni. Everything<br />\nhas been done to make this reunion a great success and there is no doubt that it will be of inestimable value to the University.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE LIFE.<br />\nMURRAY P. BRUSH.<br />\n<br />\nThe college man who enters the graduate<br />\nschool of the Johns Hopkins University for<br />\nthe first time is invariably impressed by two<br />\nthings. The first of these is the situation of<br />\nthe University buildings, in the heart of the<br />\ncity, hemmed in on all sides by red brick<br />\nwalls rising from roughly-paved, ill-kept<br />\nstreets, with an extensive view from the upper<br />\nwindows of flat, tin roofs dotted with chimney<br />\npots. But the graduate student conies here<br />\nfor a definite purpose, his college days are<br />\nover, he has elected to become a specialist in<br />\none way or another and be soon finds himself<br />\nso deep in his choSen field of work that he becomes oblivious to his surroundings, or if he<br />\nthinks of them it is to be glad that they do<br />\nnot tempt him to relaxation or idleness.<br />\nWith the undergraduate the case is entirely<br />\ndifferent, to be sure he conies to college to<br />\ncontinue his studies and to fit himself to take<br />\nhis place in the professional or industrial life<br />\nof the nation, but it is not yet time for him<br />\nto devote himself to one, particular subject,<br />\nhis especial aim is the enlargement of his<br />\nmental horizon, the acquirement of a broad<br />\nculture which shall be a firm foundation to<br />\nbuild on in the future. The group system of<br />\nstudies followed in college is directly intended<br />\nto aid in this general development of the<br />\nundergraduate student, in each group the<br />\nwork is so arranged that no one may receive<br />\nthe degree of bachelor of arts who has not<br />\nhad training in mathematics, languages, history, and science, in addition to special training in the subjects most congenial to his<br />\ntastes. The various instructors, likewise,<br />\ntake a deep interest in the broad development<br />\nof the student and do all in their power both<br />\nin the class-room and as advisers to keep him<br />\nfrom confining his studies to too narrow<br />\nlimits.<br />\nBut no boy becomes a man simply through<br />\nclose attention to lectures and diligent perusal<br />\nof text-books, the real keynote of his development lies in his relation to other people, that<br />\nis, when he has entered college, to his fellowstudents. This brings me to the second<br />\nfeature which impresses the entering graduate<br />\nstudent, the apparent lack of college life<br />\n<br />\nand spirit in the undergraduate body as a<br />\nwhole. The great majority of men who come<br />\nto the University as graduate students have<br />\nbeen living in an atmosphere where there was<br />\njust one object, one love in the student's life,<br />\na love which filled his heart from his freshman<br />\nto his senior year, the welfare of his alma<br />\nmater. During the four long years at college<br />\nhe has forgotten his school days at home when<br />\nhis father used to tell him to run upstairs at<br />\neight o'clock to study his lessons, while his<br />\nmother looked to see if he had put on his<br />\nrubbers on rainy mornings. His love and<br />\nrespect for his father and mother have in no<br />\nwise diminished, in fact, he has just learned<br />\nreally to appreciate what they are to him, but<br />\nhe has learned to do his own thinking, to<br />\nrely on himself, he has become independent<br />\nand thereby free.<br />\nOf course, the change did not come about<br />\nall at once, many were the days, when he first<br />\nwent to college, when he felt lonesome and<br />\nmiserable, and when everything looked blue<br />\nto him. But by and by, he began to say to<br />\nhimself like the oriental sage, 'This, too, will<br />\npass,\" be made friends with the other men,<br />\nhelped them to share their burdens and was<br />\nhelped himself.<br />\nHere, at Hopkins, the case is altogether different, so many of the students live in town,<br />\nthat very few indeed find themselves suddenly<br />\ndependent upon their own resources and<br />\nseparated from all friends save the other members of their class, and often it results that<br />\nwhen things do not go just right to suit every<br />\nman, instead of trying to find out if the hitch<br />\nis not with himself, he simply goes home,<br />\nstays away from the rest of the crowd, and<br />\nremains a little school-boy to the end of his<br />\ncollege course. It is hardly necessary to say<br />\nthat such a boy loses half the benefit as well<br />\nas all the fun of going to college, he would be<br />\nnearly as well off if he staid at home and<br />\nemployed a tutor, he cannot develop as he<br />\nshould without the fresh, joyous companionship of his equals. I know of but one case<br />\nsadder than his, the case of the American boy<br />\nwho has been educated abroad and comes<br />\nback a stranger to live his later life in the<br />\nfree, democratic bustle of his native land.<br />\nThe graduate student, as said above,<br />\nnotices on entering an apparent lack of college<br />\n<br />\n\f5<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nlife,but that does not mean that there is no such<br />\nlife here, simply that it manifests itself under<br />\ndifferent conditions from those prevalent elsewhere. Situated as we are in the midst of a<br />\ngreat city, the noisy exuberance of the little<br />\ncountry collegian is beneath our dignity, we<br />\ndo not wish to make our proud University<br />\nridiculous in the eyes of her neighbors by<br />\nnoisy street brawls or childish parades of the<br />\nfreshmen; we can leave such pleasures to<br />\nsecond rate fraternal organizations, or darky<br />\npicnics.<br />\nNo, the secret of real college life at Johns<br />\nHopkins, as at any great city college, is found<br />\nin the independence of the individual students,<br />\nand, fortunately, they are not lacking, who<br />\nare manly enough not to yield to the pressure<br />\nof their surroundings, who triumph over unfavorable conditions, and who live their own<br />\nlives as freely and independently as if they<br />\nhad only themselves to rely upon in times of<br />\nperplexity and sorrow. It is these bolder men<br />\nwho really get the good out of life here; they<br />\nbecome the alumni that do not forget their<br />\ncollege; they are the men we are all proud of<br />\nin after life. In spite of the fact that they<br />\nlive at home and have many ties and demands<br />\nupon their time that the man who lives in a<br />\ndormitory knows nothing of, they do not let<br />\nthese things hold them back from taking part<br />\nin the various fields of college activity. As<br />\nfreshmen they get together and form a strong<br />\nclass organization in which the opposing factions will put the good of the class and of the<br />\ncpllege above their own petty desires, and<br />\nwhere everybody will pull together. They<br />\njoin fraternities and play on the teams, if they<br />\ncan, and when they do they are not too proud<br />\nto keep up a close friendship with less fortunate<br />\nmembers of the class. Above all, they stand<br />\non their own merits and judge their classmates<br />\nby what they are and neither ask nor care<br />\nwhether their great-grandfathers owned slaves<br />\nin Maryland or were pauper immigrants.<br />\nThese college men, for they and they alone<br />\nhave a right to the name, do not let outside,<br />\nsocial engagements interfere with anything<br />\nwhich may claim their presence at the University. They take their.best girls to the Hopkins dances, but do not spend every afternoon<br />\nsitting with them on their front steps, when<br />\nthey might be helping along the cause of<br />\n<br />\nJ. H. U. by getting out to practice on the<br />\nfootball field or track. And when they go to<br />\nthe games and to the theatre on Hopkins<br />\nNight they do not sit back and look on while<br />\nothers do the cheering and singing.<br />\nAnd yet this is only one side of college life,<br />\nonly a few of the many things we remember<br />\nin after days. The other side is equally attractive, the long talks with two or three<br />\nfellows around a good fire in the winter, or<br />\nby the water's edge in the spring, the long<br />\nwalks on frosty afternoons through the woods<br />\ndown toward Ilchester, or out around Loch<br />\nRaven, or the little intimate gatherings where<br />\na few fellows get together and discuss things,<br />\nnot people, and where you learn to stand up for<br />\nyour own side, yet listen to the other man, too,<br />\nand get that broad-minded point of view which<br />\nwill let you judge of a thing by what it is and<br />\nnot by some preconceived prejudice or theory<br />\nof what it might be.<br />\nIt is just such little things as these, taken<br />\nall together, the things in which we are<br />\nbrought into close relations with the other<br />\nmen, that go to make up the real life at college, and to live that life, to enjoy it, and to<br />\nbenefit by it, we must forget ourselves, we<br />\nmust put the college first and try to do all in<br />\nour power to promote its dignity and welfare.<br />\nAnd if we live thus for it, the four years of<br />\ncollege will be the happiest of our lives, and<br />\nwe shall learn the real, true meaning of those<br />\nmagic words, Alma Mater.<br />\n<br />\nCOTILLON CLUB.<br />\nThe Cotillon Club has already had several<br />\nmeetings, and is now busily engaged in preparations for the series of dances which it is<br />\ngoing to give this season.

Like Cceser, renit,<br />\nvine/f. Of the game there is more to be<br />\nsaid than the limited amount of space allows.<br />\nHopkins played the steadier, headier, game;<br />\nthe excellent headwork of Stollenwerck at<br />\nquarter, the long punts of Michael and Fulton,<br />\nthe defense work of McCabe, and the absolute<br />\nreliability of Musser getting down under kicks,<br />\nwere probably the features which won for<br />\nHopkins. While Haverford probably excelled<br />\nin line bucking, their inability to handle punts,<br />\ntheir continual fumbling, and the failure of<br />\ntheir tackles to stop Capt. Stockton and<br />\nMichael from breaking through the blocking<br />\npunts, lost the game for them. This last<br />\ncause, more than any other, led to Hopkins'<br />\nvictory. Twice punts were blocked within<br />\nHaverford's twenty-yard line. One of these<br />\nresulted in a touchdown and the other in a<br />\nsafety for Hopkins. The safety was the most<br />\nspectacular thing in the game. Bosley broke<br />\nthrough and blocked Haverford's punt, the<br />\nball rolling under a wire fence, some<br />\ntwenty yards back of Haverford's goal line.<br />\nFulton, and Tomlinson of Haverford both<br />\ntried to jump the fence. Fulton succeeded,<br />\nbut Tomlinson crashed into the fence. Everybody thought Fulton would get the ball, but<br />\nthere was still an unaccounted-for factor in<br />\nthe shape one small boy who picked up the<br />\nball and threw it to Tomlinson. Hopkins'<br />\nclaim of a touchdown on account of interfer-<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\n.043)MISNIN<br />\nance by the spectators was not allowed, it<br />\nbeing called a safety. The first half closed a<br />\nfew minutes later, the score being Hopkins, 2;<br />\nHaverford, 0.<br />\nIn the second half Hopkins kicked off to<br />\nHaverford's twenty-yard line. Haverford<br />\nthen, by steady line plunges, carried the ball<br />\nto Hopkins' five-yard line. A cross buck<br />\nthrough tackle netted about six inches, and an<br />\nend run resulted in the loss of three yards.<br />\nNow, on third down with seven yards to gain,<br />\nTomlinson went between for a touchdown.<br />\nAfter the kickoff, on an exchange of kicks,<br />\nit was Hopkins' ball on Haverford's twentyfive yard line. After two futile attempts to<br />\ngain through the line, Stollenwerck dropped<br />\nback and put a drop kick squarely between<br />\nthe bars.<br />\nThe game now resolved into a kicking dual,<br />\nHopkins having a large advantage. Michael<br />\nblocked a punt on Haverford's twenty-five<br />\nyard line and Stockton fell on it for a touchdown.<br />\n<br />\nGALLAUDET AND DELAWARE.<br />\nAfter meeting three strong, well-balanced<br />\nteams like Western Maryland, Stevens, and<br />\nHaverford, and coming through with a tie<br />\nscore and two victories, the games with<br />\nGallaudet and Delaware seem to be easy ones.<br />\nGallaudet is not showing its usual form this<br />\nyear, while Delaware, though probably as<br />\ngood this year as last, has not advanced<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nmuch. We can truthfully say that the<br />\n'Varsity football team is better in every way<br />\nthis year than last. Therefore, these two<br />\ngames should be easy victories for the Black<br />\nand Blue.<br />\nGallaudet, however, has a tendency to show<br />\nunexpected strength, for in a hard-fought<br />\ngame they held Mount Washington to a<br />\nscoreless tie. On the following week the<br />\nMutes took a slump and lost to the Maryland<br />\nAgriculture College, 5 to 0. On October<br />\n24th, Richmond College defeated Gallaudet,<br />\n16 to 12. This game showed that the Mutes<br />\nplay especially strong in the second half, for<br />\nit was in that half that they scored their two<br />\ntouchdowns. The latest lineup of Gallaudet<br />\nis as follows:<br />\nLeft end\u2014Hower, Captain.<br />\nLeft tackle\u2014Gardner.<br />\nLeft guard \u2014Talbert.<br />\nCenter\u2014Bell.<br />\nRight guard\u2014Caldwell.<br />\nRight tackle\u2014Isaacson.<br />\nRight end\u2014Mosey.<br />\nQuarterback-0'Donnell.<br />\nLeft halfback\u2014McInnis.<br />\nRight halfback\u2014Baily, Arras.<br />\nFullback\u2014Birk.<br />\nLast year Delaware College held us to a<br />\n0 to 0 tie, but this year we sincerely hope<br />\nand are almost certain that the result will be<br />\ndifferent. Delaware has not made a brilliant<br />\nrecord this season, having lost three out of<br />\nthe four games played. Williamson, Haverford and Bucknell all won from the Newark<br />\nteam. Delaware's single victory came on<br />\nOctober 31st, when she defeated Washington<br />\nCollege, 12 to 0.

The treaty is modelled, in great part, on Inter-Club Treaties at Princeton, copies<br />\nwhich<br />\nwere very kindly furnished by the Registrar of that University.<br />\nof<br />\n(2). The date in Article III., Section 1, is placed at March 1, to allow students of<br />\npreparatory schools, home during the Easter holidays, to have an opportunity to get some idea<br />\nof the life at the University, before deciding to what college they will go.<br />\n(3).

FRENCH'S interesting article, entitled '`Upper Classmen and<br />\nLower,\" which was published in the previous issue of the NEWSLETTER, brings up, among many things, the question of freshman<br />\nclass election.<br />\nWhen a freshman class comes together for the first time to elect<br />\nits officers, it is more or less in a state of disorganization. In the<br />\nfirst place, as a usual thing, about one-half of the class shows up.<br />\nNo one knows what he wants to do, and no one will keep quiet. But<br />\nworst of all, no one knows the rules of order. A chairman is hastily<br />\nappointed and the elections pushed through. If the election is held<br />\ncertain<br />\nman's<br />\nhouse<br />\nor<br />\nback yard, as was done this year, this man may very possibly be<br />\nin a<br />\nelected president or vice-president. The other elections follow in the same haphazard way.<br />\n4<br />\n1<br />\n)v<br />\nliory VVVVVVV:<br />\nVe.;\u201e,v<br />\nv 1\u20222<br /><br />\nsifylfvvv*vvy \u2022<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nAt Princeton, the freshmen class election is presided over by the president of the junior<br />\nclass. This, indeed, seems to be d very good custom, and has many advantages. In the first<br />\nplace, the freshmen, recognizing a leader, all come to the meeting; in the second place, the<br />\nfreshmen are made to keep quiet and consequently consider the merits of the candidates; and,<br />\nlast of all, the rules of order are strictly observed.<br />\nNow, if in the future the upper classmen at Hopkins are to assume more dignity and<br />\nresponsibility, it seems that the introduction of this custom might form a good beginning.<br /><br />\nreading the local dailies of the last few weeks<br />\nYt. VERVONE who has been<br /><br />\nhas doubtless noticed how little space some of them are giving to<br />\nHopkins football news.

BRUSH.<br /><br />\nThe college man who enters the graduate<br />\nschool of the Johns Hopkins University for<br />\nthe first time is invariably impressed by two<br />\nthings. The first of these is the situation of<br />\nthe University buildings, in the heart of the<br />\ncity, hemmed in on all sides by red brick<br />\nwalls rising from roughly-paved, ill-kept<br />\nstreets, with an extensive view from the upper<br />\nwindows of flat, tin roofs dotted with chimney<br />\npots. But the graduate student conies here<br />\nfor a definite purpose, his college days are<br />\nover, he has elected to become a specialist in<br />\none way or another and be soon finds himself<br />\nso deep in his choSen field of work that he becomes oblivious to his surroundings, or if he<br />\nthinks of them it is to be glad that they do<br />\nnot tempt him to relaxation or idleness.<br />\nWith the undergraduate the case is entirely<br />\ndifferent, to be sure he conies to college to<br />\ncontinue his studies and to fit himself to take<br />\nhis place in the professional or industrial life<br />\nof the nation, but it is not yet time for him<br />\nto devote himself to one, particular subject,<br />\nhis especial aim is the enlargement of his<br />\nmental horizon, the acquirement of a broad<br />\nculture which shall be a firm foundation to<br />\nbuild on in the future. The group system of<br />\nstudies followed in college is directly intended<br />\nto aid in this general development of the<br />\nundergraduate student, in each group the<br />\nwork is so arranged that no one may receive<br />\nthe degree of bachelor of arts who has not<br />\nhad training in mathematics, languages, history, and science, in addition to special training in the subjects most congenial to his<br />\ntastes. The various instructors, likewise,<br />\ntake a deep interest in the broad development<br />\nof the student and do all in their power both<br />\nin the class-room and as advisers to keep him<br />\nfrom confining his studies to too narrow<br />\nlimits.<br />\nBut no boy becomes a man simply through<br />\nclose attention to lectures and diligent perusal<br />\nof text-books, the real keynote of his development lies in his relation to other people, that<br />\nis, when he has entered college, to his fellowstudents. This brings me to the second<br />\nfeature which impresses the entering graduate<br />\nstudent, the apparent lack of college life<br /><br />\nand spirit in the undergraduate body as a<br />\nwhole. The great majority of men who come<br />\nto the University as graduate students have<br />\nbeen living in an atmosphere where there was<br />\njust one object, one love in the student's life,<br />\na love which filled his heart from his freshman<br />\nto his senior year, the welfare of his alma<br />\nmater. During the four long years at college<br />\nhe has forgotten his school days at home when<br />\nhis father used to tell him to run upstairs at<br />\neight o'clock to study his lessons, while his<br />\nmother looked to see if he had put on his<br />\nrubbers on rainy mornings. His love and<br />\nrespect for his father and mother have in no<br />\nwise diminished, in fact, he has just learned<br />\nreally to appreciate what they are to him, but<br />\nhe has learned to do his own thinking, to<br />\nrely on himself, he has become independent<br />\nand thereby free.<br />\nOf course, the change did not come about<br />\nall at once, many were the days, when he first<br />\nwent to college, when he felt lonesome and<br />\nmiserable, and when everything looked blue<br />\nto him. But by and by, he began to say to<br />\nhimself like the oriental sage, 'This, too, will<br />\npass,\" be made friends with the other men,<br />\nhelped them to share their burdens and was<br />\nhelped himself.<br />\nHere, at Hopkins, the case is altogether different, so many of the students live in town,<br />\nthat very few indeed find themselves suddenly<br />\ndependent upon their own resources and<br />\nseparated from all friends save the other members of their class, and often it results that<br />\nwhen things do not go just right to suit every<br />\nman, instead of trying to find out if the hitch<br />\nis not with himself, he simply goes home,<br />\nstays away from the rest of the crowd, and<br />\nremains a little school-boy to the end of his<br />\ncollege course. It is hardly necessary to say<br />\nthat such a boy loses half the benefit as well<br />\nas all the fun of going to college, he would be<br />\nnearly as well off if he staid at home and<br />\nemployed a tutor, he cannot develop as he<br />\nshould without the fresh, joyous companionship of his equals. I know of but one case<br />\nsadder than his, the case of the American boy<br />\nwho has been educated abroad and comes<br />\nback a stranger to live his later life in the<br />\nfree, democratic bustle of his native land.<br />\nThe graduate student, as said above,<br />\nnotices on entering an apparent lack of college<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nlife,but that does not mean that there is no such<br />\nlife here, simply that it manifests itself under<br />\ndifferent conditions from those prevalent elsewhere. Situated as we are in the midst of a<br />\ngreat city, the noisy exuberance of the little<br />\ncountry collegian is beneath our dignity, we<br />\ndo not wish to make our proud University<br />\nridiculous in the eyes of her neighbors by<br />\nnoisy street brawls or childish parades of the<br />\nfreshmen; we can leave such pleasures to<br />\nsecond rate fraternal organizations, or darky<br />\npicnics.<br />\nNo, the secret of real college life at Johns<br />\nHopkins, as at any great city college, is found<br />\nin the independence of the individual students,<br />\nand, fortunately, they are not lacking, who<br />\nare manly enough not to yield to the pressure<br />\nof their surroundings, who triumph over unfavorable conditions, and who live their own<br />\nlives as freely and independently as if they<br />\nhad only themselves to rely upon in times of<br />\nperplexity and sorrow. It is these bolder men<br />\nwho really get the good out of life here; they<br />\nbecome the alumni that do not forget their<br />\ncollege; they are the men we are all proud of<br />\nin after life. In spite of the fact that they<br />\nlive at home and have many ties and demands<br />\nupon their time that the man who lives in a<br />\ndormitory knows nothing of, they do not let<br />\nthese things hold them back from taking part<br />\nin the various fields of college activity. As<br />\nfreshmen they get together and form a strong<br />\nclass organization in which the opposing factions will put the good of the class and of the<br />\ncpllege above their own petty desires, and<br />\nwhere everybody will pull together. They<br />\njoin fraternities and play on the teams, if they<br />\ncan, and when they do they are not too proud<br />\nto keep up a close friendship with less fortunate<br />\nmembers of the class. Above all, they stand<br />\non their own merits and judge their classmates<br />\nby what they are and neither ask nor care<br />\nwhether their great-grandfathers owned slaves<br />\nin Maryland or were pauper immigrants.<br />\nThese college men, for they and they alone<br />\nhave a right to the name, do not let outside,<br />\nsocial engagements interfere with anything<br />\nwhich may claim their presence at the University. They take their.best girls to the Hopkins dances, but do not spend every afternoon<br />\nsitting with them on their front steps, when<br />\nthey might be helping along the cause of<br /><br />\nJ. H. U. by getting out to practice on the<br />\nfootball field or track. And when they go to<br />\nthe games and to the theatre on Hopkins<br />\nNight they do not sit back and look on while<br />\nothers do the cheering and singing.<br />\nAnd yet this is only one side of college life,<br />\nonly a few of the many things we remember<br />\nin after days. The other side is equally attractive, the long talks with two or three<br />\nfellows around a good fire in the winter, or<br />\nby the water's edge in the spring, the long<br />\nwalks on frosty afternoons through the woods<br />\ndown toward Ilchester, or out around Loch<br />\nRaven, or the little intimate gatherings where<br />\na few fellows get together and discuss things,<br />\nnot people, and where you learn to stand up for<br />\nyour own side, yet listen to the other man, too,<br />\nand get that broad-minded point of view which<br />\nwill let you judge of a thing by what it is and<br />\nnot by some preconceived prejudice or theory<br />\nof what it might be.<br />\nIt is just such little things as these, taken<br />\nall together, the things in which we are<br />\nbrought into close relations with the other<br />\nmen, that go to make up the real life at college, and to live that life, to enjoy it, and to<br />\nbenefit by it, we must forget ourselves, we<br />\nmust put the college first and try to do all in<br />\nour power to promote its dignity and welfare.<br />\nAnd if we live thus for it, the four years of<br />\ncollege will be the happiest of our lives, and<br />\nwe shall learn the real, true meaning of those<br />\nmagic words, Alma Mater.<br /><br />\nCOTILLON CLUB.<br />\nThe Cotillon Club has already had several<br />\nmeetings, and is now busily engaged in preparations for the series of dances which it is<br />\ngoing to give this season.

The dances will be held,as<br />\nusual, in McCoy Hall, which is one of the<br />\nlargest ball rooms in the city.

Like Cceser, renit,<br />\nvine/f. Of the game there is more to be<br />\nsaid than the limited amount of space allows.<br />\nHopkins played the steadier, headier, game;<br />\nthe excellent headwork of Stollenwerck at<br />\nquarter, the long punts of Michael and Fulton,<br />\nthe defense work of McCabe, and the absolute<br />\nreliability of Musser getting down under kicks,<br />\nwere probably the features which won for<br />\nHopkins. While Haverford probably excelled<br />\nin line bucking, their inability to handle punts,<br />\ntheir continual fumbling, and the failure of<br />\ntheir tackles to stop Capt. Stockton and<br />\nMichael from breaking through the blocking<br />\npunts, lost the game for them. This last<br />\ncause, more than any other, led to Hopkins'<br />\nvictory. Twice punts were blocked within<br />\nHaverford's twenty-yard line. One of these<br />\nresulted in a touchdown and the other in a<br />\nsafety for Hopkins. The safety was the most<br />\nspectacular thing in the game. Bosley broke<br />\nthrough and blocked Haverford's punt, the<br />\nball rolling under a wire fence, some<br />\ntwenty yards back of Haverford's goal line.<br />\nFulton, and Tomlinson of Haverford both<br />\ntried to jump the fence. Fulton succeeded,<br />\nbut Tomlinson crashed into the fence. Everybody thought Fulton would get the ball, but<br />\nthere was still an unaccounted-for factor in<br />\nthe shape one small boy who picked up the<br />\nball and threw it to Tomlinson. Hopkins'<br />\nclaim of a touchdown on account of interfer-<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\n.043)MISNIN<br />\nance by the spectators was not allowed, it<br />\nbeing called a safety. The first half closed a<br />\nfew minutes later, the score being Hopkins, 2;<br />\nHaverford, 0.<br />\nIn the second half Hopkins kicked off to<br />\nHaverford's twenty-yard line. Haverford<br />\nthen, by steady line plunges, carried the ball<br />\nto Hopkins' five-yard line. A cross buck<br />\nthrough tackle netted about six inches, and an<br />\nend run resulted in the loss of three yards.<br />\nNow, on third down with seven yards to gain,<br />\nTomlinson went between for a touchdown.<br />\nAfter the kickoff, on an exchange of kicks,<br />\nit was Hopkins' ball on Haverford's twentyfive yard line. After two futile attempts to<br />\ngain through the line, Stollenwerck dropped<br />\nback and put a drop kick squarely between<br />\nthe bars.<br />\nThe game now resolved into a kicking dual,<br />\nHopkins having a large advantage. Michael<br />\nblocked a punt on Haverford's twenty-five<br />\nyard line and Stockton fell on it for a touchdown.<br /><br />\nGALLAUDET AND DELAWARE.<br />\nAfter meeting three strong, well-balanced<br />\nteams like Western Maryland, Stevens, and<br />\nHaverford, and coming through with a tie<br />\nscore and two victories, the games with<br />\nGallaudet and Delaware seem to be easy ones.<br />\nGallaudet is not showing its usual form this<br />\nyear, while Delaware, though probably as<br />\ngood this year as last, has not advanced<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nmuch. We can truthfully say that the<br />\n'Varsity football team is better in every way<br />\nthis year than last. Therefore, these two<br />\ngames should be easy victories for the Black<br />\nand Blue.<br />\nGallaudet, however, has a tendency to show<br />\nunexpected strength, for in a hard-fought<br />\ngame they held Mount Washington to a<br />\nscoreless tie. On the following week the<br />\nMutes took a slump and lost to the Maryland<br />\nAgriculture College, 5 to 0. On October<br />\n24th, Richmond College defeated Gallaudet,<br />\n16 to 12. This game showed that the Mutes<br />\nplay especially strong in the second half, for<br />\nit was in that half that they scored their two<br />\ntouchdowns.
