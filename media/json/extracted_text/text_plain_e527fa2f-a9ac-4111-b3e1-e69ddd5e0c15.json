Benjamin Franklin was<br />\nthoroughly steeped ill the rich<br />\nhumanist traditions of Leibniz,<br />\nMilton, the Tudor Renaissance,<br />\nJean Bodin, and the great Islamic<br />\ngenius lb ii Sina.

The U.S. Labor<br />\nParty in efforts to support the<br />\n\"secret knowledge\" of tile<br />\nhumanist elite to the working<br />\nclass througii its educational<br />\norganizing process has witnessed<br />\nthe ability of exceptional trade<br />\nunionists to grasp tile full<br />\nknowledge of American<br />\nCapitalism.

Mr. Hardwicke, who<br />\ncelebrated his fifty-first birthday<br />\non Monday, has taught a course<br />\nin Business Law in the Evening<br />\nCollege since 1956. He has been a<br />\ngeneral practicing attorney in<br />\nBaltimore since 1955. Born in<br />\nWinston- Salem North Carolina,<br />\nMr. Hardwicke attended the<br />\nUniversity of North Carolina and<br />\nthe George Washington<br />\nUniversity School of Law. He<br />\nwas a member of the House of<br />\nDelegates (1962-1966), the<br />\nConstitutional Convention, and<br />\nthe Harford County Council. Mr.<br />\nHardwicke now<br />\nlives near<br />\nHavre-de-Grace , in Harford<br />\nCounty.<br />\nNews-Letter: You've taught<br />\nBusiness Law for over twenty<br />\nyears. What strikes you most<br />\nabout your classes over the<br />\nyears?<br />\nHardwicke: I guess the most<br />\nmemorable experience would be<br />\nthat in every political campaign<br />\nI've ever been involved in my<br />\nstudents at Johns Hopkins have<br />\nin one way or another helped me.<br />\nN -L: Who are your main<br />\nchallengers in the Republican<br />\nprimary?<br />\nHardwicke: In the primary I<br />\ndon't know yet; surely I'll have<br />\nsome opposition by September<br />\ntwelfth.<br />\nN-L: September Twelfth is a<br />\nrather late primary.<br />\nHardwicke: The late primary is<br />\nhard on us Republicans because<br />\nwe don't have as much exposure.<br />\nWe don't get the exposure in a<br />\nprimary that the Democrats get,<br />\nand the result is that we go into<br />\nthe primaries pretty cold and<br />\nwe've got to get out fast from<br />\nSeptember to November.<br />\nN-L: So you don't know of any<br />\nparticular opposition thus far?<br />\nHardwicke: I understand there's<br />\na professor in the University of<br />\nMaryland running, but that's it so<br />\nfar.<br />\nN-L: If you won the Republican<br />\nPrimary, do you think you could<br />\ndefeat the Democratic candidate?<br />\nHardwicke: Yes. I'm not<br />\ninterested in going after red<br />\nribbons.<br />\nN-L: Who do you think the<br />\nDemocratic nominee is most<br />\nlikely to be?<br />\nliar dwicke: It's between Ted<br />\nVenetoulis and Blair Lee. If the<br />\nPrimary were held tomorrow, it<br />\nwould be Blair Lee. But Ted<br />\nVenetoulis is a strong challenger.<br />\nI think the late primary date will<br />\nbe to Blair Lee's disadvantage.<br />\nN-L: Why haven't we heard too<br />\nmuch about your campaign?<br />\nHardwicke: What would , you<br />\nhear? In other words, when<br />\nYou're a lonely Republican, what<br />\nnews are you making?<br />\nN-L: Why is it in Maryland that<br />\nthe Republicans are lonely?<br />\nHardwicke: Basically, Maryland<br />\nis a Southern state, and it has<br />\nthe<br />\nProfile of a Southern state, with<br />\na\u2014<br />\nye.), weak Republican party.<br />\nGradually, that condition is being<br />\ncorrected as we Republicans are<br />\nwinning elections across the<br />\nSouth. We're gradually getting<br />\nmore and more attention, but we<br />\n<br />\nhave to make our own news.<br />\nN-L: What are the main issues in<br />\nthe campaign?<br />\nHardwicke: Taxes. I think the<br />\nvery, very rough tax that<br />\nMarylanders are paying is of great<br />\nconcern. We're the second<br />\nhighest tax state in the nation.<br />\nThat is the big issue.<br />\nN-L: As Governor, what would<br />\nyou do about this?<br />\nHardwicke: I would say that the<br />\nGovernor of Maryland ought to<br />\ndo several things. First of all, he<br />\nshould make a very, very<br />\ndetermined effort to cut the size<br />\nof government, which should cut<br />\nthe cost of government. And<br />\nsecond, he needs to increase the<br />\nindustrial and commercial base,<br />\nwhich means that there would be<br />\nmore industry and business<br />\nsharing the tax burden with the<br />\npeople.<br />\nN-L: What kind .of job has Acting<br />\nGovernor Blair Lee done?<br />\nHardwicke: Rather poor, I think.<br />\nI don't believe he's done much to<br />\nestablish. a record for himself.<br />\nHe's kept all of Marvin Mandel's<br />\nold cronies and friends on the<br />\njob. He has not set out to build a<br />\nnew image for state government.<br />\nIt's basically a continuation of<br />\nMarvin Mandel's regime.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of the<br />\nrecent law that restores the death<br />\npenalty in Maryland?<br />\nHardwicke: I favor a death<br />\npenalty, not because I think a<br />\ndeath penalty deters crime, but<br />\nbecause I think there are some<br />\ncrimes that are so horrible that<br />\nthe punishment for those crimes<br />\nwould appropriately be death for<br />\nthe person who 'perpetrated<br />\nthem.<br />\nN-L: And those crimes are?<br />\nHardwicke: Almost any crime<br />\nwhere a person takes the life of<br />\nanother person or does suCh<br />\nharm to another person<br />\ndeliberately or maliciously and<br />\nwith thought beforehand, I think<br />\nsociety ought to be able to cause<br />\nthat person to forfeit his own<br />\nlife.<br />\nN-L: Do you think there should<br />\nbe a prison at the Fort Armistad<br />\n<br />\nsales tax.<br />\nN -L: Do you think the<br />\nsubstantial salary increase<br />\nenacted recently by the House<br />\nof Delegates for itself was<br />\nnecessary?<br />\nHardwicke: I think that the<br />\nHouse of Delegates is overpaid.<br />\n$16,000 per year, plus expenses,<br />\nis high.<br />\nN-L: What about the increase in<br />\nthe Governor's salary from<br />\n$25,000 to $60,000? Do you<br />\n<br />\nagree vfith the argument that a<br />\nhigher salary prevents governors<br />\nfrom accepting bribes and<br />\nkickbacks in order to make ends<br />\nmeet?<br />\nHardwicke: I don't accept that<br />\nargument at all. You shouldn't<br />\nhave a dishonest man, period. A<br />\ndishonest man will steal whether<br />\nhe's making sixty thousand or if<br />\nhe's making six thousand.<br />\nComparing the Governor with<br />\nthe other executives in Maryland,<br />\nI believe $60,000 is a reasonable<br />\nsalary. The School<br />\nSuperintendant of Baltimore City<br />\nmakes $50,000. The Lieutenant<br />\nGovernor makes $49,000. I don't<br />\nsee now in toe world you can<br />\n<br />\n\"I believe that the<br />\nmajority of<br />\nMarylanders and<br />\nAmericans are probably conservative.\"<br />\nsite?<br />\nHardwicke: No,I think the prison<br />\nshould be built at the present<br />\nsite. I think that there's room<br />\nthere on the grounds for the<br />\naddition of further space onto<br />\nthat prison. Where at all possible,<br />\nprisons should be expanded at<br />\nthe present sites.<br />\nN-L: What about the $130<br />\nmillion budget surplus?<br />\nHardwicke.: It just proves that we<br />\ndidn't need a hike of 20% on the<br />\n<br />\njustify paying the Governor<br />\nanything less than $60,000, to be<br />\nin line with what the other<br />\npeople are making. I am not<br />\nrunning for Governor for the<br />\n$60,000; I'm making far more<br />\nthan that as a lawyer.<br />\nN-L: What are your views on<br />\nincreasing government aid to<br />\npublic and private schools from<br />\nthe elementary to the University<br />\nlevels in Maryland?<br />\nHardwicke: I don't want any aid<br />\n<br />\nthat is given to jeopardize the<br />\npublic school system. I favor<br />\nbasically strengthening the public<br />\nschool system. I am not positive I<br />\nhave made a firm conclusion on<br />\nthe 'private schools yet; I want to<br />\nthink about that.<br />\nN-L: What do you see as the<br />\nfuture of the Republican party in<br />\nMaryland and in the United<br />\nStates?<br />\nHardwicke: I think that tne<br />\nRepublican Party philosophy,<br />\n<br />\nassuming that it is a conservative<br />\nphilosophy, is more acceptable to<br />\na majority of the people than the<br />\nso-called liberal philosophy. I<br />\nbelieve that the majority of<br />\nMarylanders and the majority of<br />\nAmercans are probably<br />\nconservative. I think that if the<br />\nRepublican party will hold to<br />\nthat philosophy and state it<br />\narticulately and consistently,<br />\nthen the Republican party will<br />\nagain become the majority party<br />\nin \u2022America.<br />\nN-L: A number of articles in<br />\npopular magazines have<br />\nquestioned recently whether the<br />\namount of law in America today<br />\nis excessive. Do you think there is<br />\ntoo much law?<br />\nHardwicke: I think that a<br />\nin<br />\npl i city of law impinges<br />\nupon freedom. Freedom is the<br />\nprivelege of self- control - it is<br />\nnot freedom from control. So<br />\nlaw should not act upon people<br />\nwho are able to control<br />\nthemselves. Every time you have<br />\nthe government doing anything it<br />\nmultiplies the people who have<br />\nto carry out the law. We've got to<br />\nstop that - Dthat's part of the<br />\nreason for these big tax bills.<br />\nN-L: Can laws be simplified?<br />\nHardwicke: Yes. I'm glad you<br />\nasked the question thatway. The<br />\nlaws can be simplified. The laws<br />\nshould be simplified, because one<br />\nof the best crime deterrents we<br />\nhave is that when a person<br />\nviolates the law, he knows that<br />\nhe is going to receive a swift,<br />\ncertain punishment.

I would favor a<br />\ncomplete re-writing of the<br />\nregulations on the books,<br />\nbeginning with simplification,<br />\ncutting out the excess, making<br />\nthe language simpler and easier to<br />\nread, and getting rid of laws<br />\nwhich are in duplication either<br />\nby legislative enactment or by<br />\nadministrative or executive fiat.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that a<br />\nsimplification of laws would help<br />\nan average person conduct his<br />\nown legal affairs?<br />\nHardwicke: I think that<br />\nwhenever possible we should do<br />\naway with the services of a<br />\nlawyer. A person should be able<br />\nto defend himself and be able to<br />\nprosecute iris own claims - but<br />\nwhen he does so it should be<br />\nquite clear that he gives up all<br />\nrights to a lawyer in that case.

I<br />\nbelieve that courts are too full of<br />\nautomobile cases - those should<br />\nall be handled without judicial<br />\nprocess. Workmen's<br />\ncompensation should be prepared<br />\nand presented by a person against<br />\nhis employer without the aid of a<br />\nlawyer. I can see so many cases<br />\nof ordinary life situations where<br />\nlawyers only make things more<br />\ncomplicated.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel that lawyers, as<br />\nthe predominant members of the<br />\nllouse of Delegates, would allow<br />\na Governor to make these<br />\nchanges?<br />\nHardwicke: When we tried to get<br />\nno-fault insurance in Maryland,<br />\nthe lawyer members killed it.

Second, there'd be a danger of<br />\nbeing attacked if the tunnels were open all the<br />\ntime and there wasn't enough security.\"<br />\n\"But there is one tunnel that's in legitimate<br />\nuse,\" another added. \"Chem professors use the<br />\ntunnel between Remsen and Dunning when it's<br />\nraining. It's not a steam tunnel anymore, though.<br />\nThey put in lights. It's really like a hallway.\"<br />\nAt about 4 a.m. t decided to part company.<br />\nThe others were still avidly discussing<br />\nDungeon s- a n d-Dragons and plotting farther<br />\nescapades in the tunnels.

Not<br />\nwanting to -- or rather, not believing i could -wake up my roommate, I tried to push up the<br />\nwindow. I felt a tap on my shoulder and spun<br />\naround. Yes, it was a security guard.<br />\n\"Wnat are you trying to do?\" he demanded,<br />\nnot without some justification.<br />\nput on my best 4:15 smile. \"I'm trying to get<br />\ninto my room because I forgot my key?\"<br />\nSomehow it didn't sound 'very convincing.<br />\nFortunately, the security guard opened the dorm<br />\ndoor. He then followed me to my room.<br />\n\"Good night,\" I told him. \"Tnank you very<br />\nmuch.\"<br />\nBut he was not yuite satisfied. He wanted me<br />\nto wake up my roommate and have her identify<br />\nme.

Don't<br />\nyou believe that BULL for one<br />\nminute! After last week's<br />\nthrashing of Virginia by the<br />\ncount of 17-7 (the Wahoos<br />\naveraged 15 goals a game before<br />\nSaturday), the Blue Jays not only<br />\nproved that they are competitive<br />\nwith Cornell, but also that they<br />\nmay very well be the best<br />\ndamned team in all of college<br />\nlacrosse.

The<br />\nJays first met the Big Red in<br />\n1973, and each of the ensuing<br />\ncontests has been filled with<br />\nthrills,excitement and super<br />\nlacrosse action. Usually, there is a<br />\ntitle at stake when these two<br />\npowers clash. Certainly, no one<br />\ncan forget last year's cliff hanger<br />\nin New York when Cornell came<br />\nfrom behind to take a one-goal<br />\nvictory.<br />\n\"The writers usually play up<br />\nthis game the most,\" commented<br />\nCoach Ciccarone, \"because<br />\nCornell is the new boy on the<br />\nblock and we have always been<br />\nthere. This is a rivalry that will<br />\ncontinue well into the future.\"<br />\nThis is, without a doubt,<br />\n<br />\nComell's toughest competition of<br />\nthe year considering the fact that<br />\nthey do not play any other of the<br />\ntop five Division 1 teams.<br />\nApparently, this freak schedule is<br />\nno doing of the Big Red's coach,<br />\nRichie Moran. Maryland, Army,<br />\nNavy and Virginia just decided<br />\nthat they did not want to play<br />\nthis powerhouse.<br />\nHow does a twenty-year<br />\nveteran of Hopkins' lacrosse feel<br />\nabout such an important game?<br />\n\"If we play to our best ability,<br />\nwe will win,\" came the patented<br />\ncoach's reply to the patented<br />\nreporter's question. Chic , also<br />\nadded that tomorrow's game will<br />\nnot make or break the season.<br />\nTechnically, he is right, but one<br />\ncould tell that under that grin of<br />\nhis, Ciccarone was just as<br />\npsyched for the game as any of<br />\nhis players.

Mr. Hardwicke, who<br />\ncelebrated his fifty-first birthday<br />\non Monday, has taught a course<br />\nin Business Law in the Evening<br />\nCollege since 1956. He has been a<br />\ngeneral practicing attorney in<br />\nBaltimore since 1955. Born in<br />\nWinston- Salem North Carolina,<br />\nMr. Hardwicke attended the<br />\nUniversity of North Carolina and<br />\nthe George Washington<br />\nUniversity School of Law. He<br />\nwas a member of the House of<br />\nDelegates (1962-1966), the<br />\nConstitutional Convention, and<br />\nthe Harford County Council. Mr.<br />\nHardwicke now<br />\nlives near<br />\nHavre-de-Grace , in Harford<br />\nCounty.<br />\nNews-Letter: You've taught<br />\nBusiness Law for over twenty<br />\nyears. What strikes you most<br />\nabout your classes over the<br />\nyears?<br />\nHardwicke: I guess the most<br />\nmemorable experience would be<br />\nthat in every political campaign<br />\nI've ever been involved in my<br />\nstudents at Johns Hopkins have<br />\nin one way or another helped me.<br />\nN -L: Who are your main<br />\nchallengers in the Republican<br />\nprimary?<br />\nHardwicke: In the primary I<br />\ndon't know yet; surely I'll have<br />\nsome opposition by September<br />\ntwelfth.<br />\nN-L: September Twelfth is a<br />\nrather late primary.<br />\nHardwicke: The late primary is<br />\nhard on us Republicans because<br />\nwe don't have as much exposure.<br />\nWe don't get the exposure in a<br />\nprimary that the Democrats get,<br />\nand the result is that we go into<br />\nthe primaries pretty cold and<br />\nwe've got to get out fast from<br />\nSeptember to November.<br />\nN-L: So you don't know of any<br />\nparticular opposition thus far?<br />\nHardwicke: I understand there's<br />\na professor in the University of<br />\nMaryland running, but that's it so<br />\nfar.<br />\nN-L: If you won the Republican<br />\nPrimary, do you think you could<br />\ndefeat the Democratic candidate?<br />\nHardwicke: Yes. I'm not<br />\ninterested in going after red<br />\nribbons.<br />\nN-L: Who do you think the<br />\nDemocratic nominee is most<br />\nlikely to be?<br />\nliar dwicke: It's between Ted<br />\nVenetoulis and Blair Lee. If the<br />\nPrimary were held tomorrow, it<br />\nwould be Blair Lee. But Ted<br />\nVenetoulis is a strong challenger.<br />\nI think the late primary date will<br />\nbe to Blair Lee's disadvantage.<br />\nN-L: Why haven't we heard too<br />\nmuch about your campaign?<br />\nHardwicke: What would , you<br />\nhear? In other words, when<br />\nYou're a lonely Republican, what<br />\nnews are you making?<br />\nN-L: Why is it in Maryland that<br />\nthe Republicans are lonely?<br />\nHardwicke: Basically, Maryland<br />\nis a Southern state, and it has<br />\nthe<br />\nProfile of a Southern state, with<br />\na\u2014<br />\nye.), weak Republican party.<br />\nGradually, that condition is being<br />\ncorrected as we Republicans are<br />\nwinning elections across the<br />\nSouth. We're gradually getting<br />\nmore and more attention, but we<br /><br />\nhave to make our own news.<br />\nN-L: What are the main issues in<br />\nthe campaign?<br />\nHardwicke: Taxes. I think the<br />\nvery, very rough tax that<br />\nMarylanders are paying is of great<br />\nconcern. We're the second<br />\nhighest tax state in the nation.<br />\nThat is the big issue.<br />\nN-L: As Governor, what would<br />\nyou do about this?<br />\nHardwicke: I would say that the<br />\nGovernor of Maryland ought to<br />\ndo several things. First of all, he<br />\nshould make a very, very<br />\ndetermined effort to cut the size<br />\nof government, which should cut<br />\nthe cost of government. And<br />\nsecond, he needs to increase the<br />\nindustrial and commercial base,<br />\nwhich means that there would be<br />\nmore industry and business<br />\nsharing the tax burden with the<br />\npeople.<br />\nN-L: What kind .of job has Acting<br />\nGovernor Blair Lee done?<br />\nHardwicke: Rather poor, I think.<br />\nI don't believe he's done much to<br />\nestablish. a record for himself.<br />\nHe's kept all of Marvin Mandel's<br />\nold cronies and friends on the<br />\njob. He has not set out to build a<br />\nnew image for state government.<br />\nIt's basically a continuation of<br />\nMarvin Mandel's regime.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of the<br />\nrecent law that restores the death<br />\npenalty in Maryland?<br />\nHardwicke: I favor a death<br />\npenalty, not because I think a<br />\ndeath penalty deters crime, but<br />\nbecause I think there are some<br />\ncrimes that are so horrible that<br />\nthe punishment for those crimes<br />\nwould appropriately be death for<br />\nthe person who 'perpetrated<br />\nthem.<br />\nN-L: And those crimes are?<br />\nHardwicke: Almost any crime<br />\nwhere a person takes the life of<br />\nanother person or does suCh<br />\nharm to another person<br />\ndeliberately or maliciously and<br />\nwith thought beforehand, I think<br />\nsociety ought to be able to cause<br />\nthat person to forfeit his own<br />\nlife.<br />\nN-L: Do you think there should<br />\nbe a prison at the Fort Armistad<br /><br />\nsales tax.<br />\nN -L: Do you think the<br />\nsubstantial salary increase<br />\nenacted recently by the House<br />\nof Delegates for itself was<br />\nnecessary?<br />\nHardwicke: I think that the<br />\nHouse of Delegates is overpaid.<br />\n$16,000 per year, plus expenses,<br />\nis high.<br />\nN-L: What about the increase in<br />\nthe Governor's salary from<br />\n$25,000 to $60,000? Do you<br /><br />\nagree vfith the argument that a<br />\nhigher salary prevents governors<br />\nfrom accepting bribes and<br />\nkickbacks in order to make ends<br />\nmeet?<br />\nHardwicke: I don't accept that<br />\nargument at all. You shouldn't<br />\nhave a dishonest man, period. A<br />\ndishonest man will steal whether<br />\nhe's making sixty thousand or if<br />\nhe's making six thousand.<br />\nComparing the Governor with<br />\nthe other executives in Maryland,<br />\nI believe $60,000 is a reasonable<br />\nsalary. The School<br />\nSuperintendant of Baltimore City<br />\nmakes $50,000. The Lieutenant<br />\nGovernor makes $49,000. I don't<br />\nsee now in toe world you can<br /><br />\n\"I believe that the<br />\nmajority of<br />\nMarylanders and<br />\nAmericans are probably conservative.\"<br />\nsite?<br />\nHardwicke: No,I think the prison<br />\nshould be built at the present<br />\nsite. I think that there's room<br />\nthere on the grounds for the<br />\naddition of further space onto<br />\nthat prison. Where at all possible,<br />\nprisons should be expanded at<br />\nthe present sites.<br />\nN-L: What about the $130<br />\nmillion budget surplus?<br />\nHardwicke.: It just proves that we<br />\ndidn't need a hike of 20% on the<br /><br />\njustify paying the Governor<br />\nanything less than $60,000, to be<br />\nin line with what the other<br />\npeople are making. I am not<br />\nrunning for Governor for the<br />\n$60,000; I'm making far more<br />\nthan that as a lawyer.<br />\nN-L: What are your views on<br />\nincreasing government aid to<br />\npublic and private schools from<br />\nthe elementary to the University<br />\nlevels in Maryland?<br />\nHardwicke: I don't want any aid<br /><br />\nthat is given to jeopardize the<br />\npublic school system. I favor<br />\nbasically strengthening the public<br />\nschool system. I am not positive I<br />\nhave made a firm conclusion on<br />\nthe 'private schools yet; I want to<br />\nthink about that.<br />\nN-L: What do you see as the<br />\nfuture of the Republican party in<br />\nMaryland and in the United<br />\nStates?<br />\nHardwicke: I think that tne<br />\nRepublican Party philosophy,<br /><br />\nassuming that it is a conservative<br />\nphilosophy, is more acceptable to<br />\na majority of the people than the<br />\nso-called liberal philosophy. I<br />\nbelieve that the majority of<br />\nMarylanders and the majority of<br />\nAmercans are probably<br />\nconservative. I think that if the<br />\nRepublican party will hold to<br />\nthat philosophy and state it<br />\narticulately and consistently,<br />\nthen the Republican party will<br />\nagain become the majority party<br />\nin \u2022America.<br />\nN-L: A number of articles in<br />\npopular magazines have<br />\nquestioned recently whether the<br />\namount of law in America today<br />\nis excessive. Do you think there is<br />\ntoo much law?<br />\nHardwicke: I think that a<br />\nin<br />\npl i city of law impinges<br />\nupon freedom. Freedom is the<br />\nprivelege of self- control - it is<br />\nnot freedom from control. So<br />\nlaw should not act upon people<br />\nwho are able to control<br />\nthemselves. Every time you have<br />\nthe government doing anything it<br />\nmultiplies the people who have<br />\nto carry out the law. We've got to<br />\nstop that - Dthat's part of the<br />\nreason for these big tax bills.<br />\nN-L: Can laws be simplified?<br />\nHardwicke: Yes. I'm glad you<br />\nasked the question thatway. The<br />\nlaws can be simplified. The laws<br />\nshould be simplified, because one<br />\nof the best crime deterrents we<br />\nhave is that when a person<br />\nviolates the law, he knows that<br />\nhe is going to receive a swift,<br />\ncertain punishment. In that sense<br />\nthe law should be simple,<br />\nunderstandable, and swiftly and<br />\ncertainly. executed.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of<br />\nGovernor Jerry Brown's<br />\nprograms to simplify government<br />\nin California; also, how do you<br />\nevaluate his success in the 1976<br />\nPresidential primary in<br /><br />\nMaryland?<br />\nHardwicke: I wish Jerry Brown<br />\nall the success in the world, but I<br />\ndon't believe tie's sincere. I<br />\nbelieve Jerry Brown is not<br />\nsincere. He came here and<br />\npreached lowering the cost of<br />\ngovernment, cutting back tile size<br />\nof government, and yet at tile<br />\nsame time he was in favor of the<br />\nHumphrey- Hawkins legislation,<br />\nwhich would have created the<br />\nbiggest government boondogle<br />\nthe mind of man has ever<br />\ndevised. I just don't believe Jerry<br />\nBrown is for real.<br />\nN-L: What would you do , if<br />\nelected Governor, to simplify<br />\nthings?<br />\nHardwicke: Well, I think that the<br />\nGovernor, by the power that<br />\nexists is him as Governor, should<br />\nmake the rules and the<br />\nregulations of the varied state<br />\nagencies simpler. I would favor a<br />\ncomplete re-writing of the<br />\nregulations on the books,<br />\nbeginning with simplification,<br />\ncutting out the excess, making<br />\nthe language simpler and easier to<br />\nread, and getting rid of laws<br />\nwhich are in duplication either<br />\nby legislative enactment or by<br />\nadministrative or executive fiat.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that a<br />\nsimplification of laws would help<br />\nan average person conduct his<br />\nown legal affairs?<br />\nHardwicke: I think that<br />\nwhenever possible we should do<br />\naway with the services of a<br />\nlawyer. A person should be able<br />\nto defend himself and be able to<br />\nprosecute iris own claims - but<br />\nwhen he does so it should be<br />\nquite clear that he gives up all<br />\nrights to a lawyer in that case. I<br />\nthink we use lawyers too much.<br />\nThe law profession has grown<br />\nbeyond all reason.<br />\nN-L: What sort of legal affairs<br />\nshould a person be able to<br />\nconduct without the aid of a<br />\nlawyer?<br />\nHardwicke: I think that a person<br />\nshould be able, without a lawyer,<br />\nto probably handle domestic<br />\nrelations - a divorce case. I<br />\nbelieve that courts are too full of<br />\nautomobile cases - those should<br />\nall be handled without judicial<br />\nprocess. Workmen's<br />\ncompensation should be prepared<br />\nand presented by a person against<br />\nhis employer without the aid of a<br />\nlawyer. I can see so many cases<br />\nof ordinary life situations where<br />\nlawyers only make things more<br />\ncomplicated.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel that lawyers, as<br />\nthe predominant members of the<br />\nllouse of Delegates, would allow<br />\na Governor to make these<br />\nchanges?<br />\nHardwicke: When we tried to get<br />\nno-fault insurance in Maryland,<br />\nthe lawyer members killed it. But<br />\nthat doesn't mean we shouldn't<br />\ntry to do what's right. We should<br />\nalways, always in government<br />\nattempt to decide what is best<br />\nand then try to achieve it.<br />\nRegardless of whether its<br />\nachievable, we should always try<br />\nfor what's good. The fact that it<br />\ncannot be accomplished is not<br />\nreally relevant because working<br />\nfor what is good sets proper<br />\ndirections - and its the direction<br />\nin which we're moving that is the<br />\nmost important thing.<br />\nN-L: Thank you, Mr. Hardwicke.<br /><br />\nPAGE 6/APRIL 14, 1978<br /><br />\nDiskin Clay to Resign<br />\nCONTD.

And if you're talking about safeguar<br />\nnuclear fuels, what you're really doin<br />\nquestioning the policy of going nuclear.\"<br />\nAccording to Phillips, the initial motivation<br />\nthe series of talks that he gives on col<br />\ncampuses was his hope that the publi<br />\nsurrounding his appearances would help<br />\nmotivate government officials to do somet<br />\nabout the problem of the increasing prolifera<br />\nof nuclear weapons.<br />\nNow he believes that the more serious prob<br />\nis not that nuclear fuels will be stolen by gro<br /><br />\nwho wish to sabotage or blackmail existing<br />\ngovernments, but rather that of the disposal of<br /><br />\nradioactive wastes which remain harmful for<br />\ncenturies.<br /><br />\nIf the production of more nuclear power<br />\nplants is not stopped, Phillips contends that it<br />\nwould be necessary to \"create a national police<br />\nforce, which would be prepared to act quickly<br />\nand decisively if there was a possibility that an<br />\natomic weapon would be fabricated. in addition,<br />\narmed guards would have to be stationed at<br />\nevery nuclear power plant, where plutonium is<br />\nshipped in or out, with orders to shoot to kill.\"<br />\nPhillips is convinced that the public outrage<br />\ncaused by one accident or one theft would be<br />\nsufficient to close down all nuclear reactors.<br />\nThus, in his view, the only viable long-range<br />\nsolution to the energy crisis is to go solar.<br />\n\"I would like to see a crash program in this<br />\ncountry to develop our solar energy technology.

Other times we use<br />\nthe tunnels to get into science building at odd<br />\nhours of the morning. There's a really neat<br />\nelectron microscope on Mergenthaler's fifth<br />\nfloor.\"<br />\n\"There's more computer equipment in<br />\nMergenthaler than in Barton,\" someone agreed.<br />\n\"Well, it seems to me that you gays have<br />\nprivate companies to become involved in its<br />\ndevelopment.\"<br />\nSince the completion of his bomb design,<br />\nPhillips has infrequently attended ifl of his<br />\nclassed at Princeton. \"I was an 'A' student at<br />\nBerkeley my first two years in college, but 1<br />\ndecided that so what, \\NTH() needs it?

Second, there'd be a danger of<br />\nbeing attacked if the tunnels were open all the<br />\ntime and there wasn't enough security.\"<br />\n\"But there is one tunnel that's in legitimate<br />\nuse,\" another added. \"Chem professors use the<br />\ntunnel between Remsen and Dunning when it's<br />\nraining. It's not a steam tunnel anymore, though.<br />\nThey put in lights. It's really like a hallway.\"<br />\nAt about 4 a.m. t decided to part company.<br />\nThe others were still avidly discussing<br />\nDungeon s- a n d-Dragons and plotting farther<br />\nescapades in the tunnels. When I told them I was<br />\nwalking back to the dorms, they advised me to be<br />\ncareful.<br />\n\"It's probably more dangeruus on campus than<br />\nin the tunnels,\" they said.<br />\n\"I'll be OK,\" I assured them.<br />\nWhen I got back to the dorm, the door was<br />\nlocked, and t realized I'd forgotten m/ key. Not<br />\nwanting to -- or rather, not believing i could -wake up my roommate, I tried to push up the<br />\nwindow. I felt a tap on my shoulder and spun<br />\naround. Yes, it was a security guard.<br />\n\"Wnat are you trying to do?\" he demanded,<br />\nnot without some justification.<br />\nput on my best 4:15 smile. \"I'm trying to get<br />\ninto my room because I forgot my key?\"<br />\nSomehow it didn't sound 'very convincing.<br />\nFortunately, the security guard opened the dorm<br />\ndoor. He then followed me to my room.<br />\n\"Good night,\" I told him. \"Tnank you very<br />\nmuch.\"<br />\nBut he was not yuite satisfied. He wanted me<br />\nto wake up my roommate and have her identify<br />\nme. Slightly concerned about her identifying<br />\nability at 4 in the morning, I gently roused my<br />\nroom ie.<br />\n\"Hala-Babe, you won't believe this, but...\"<br />\nHalf-way through my speech, I realized she was<br />\nstill asleep.<br />\n\"Hala, just tell the security guard it's m,:.\" Sue<br />\nmumbled something, and i looked to see if the<br />\nman nad heard her.<br />\nBut ne had disappeared.<br />\nIn the future Phillips plans to start a<br />\ncorporation that deals exclusively with inventors.<br />\nAs iie sees it, the inventor would conic Ito the<br />\ncorporation with nis idea and agree to surrender a<br />\ncertain percentage of the profits, in return for<br />\nhelp in perfecting his design and deciding on its<br />\nbest applications.

Don't<br />\nyou believe that BULL for one<br />\nminute! After last week's<br />\nthrashing of Virginia by the<br />\ncount of 17-7 (the Wahoos<br />\naveraged 15 goals a game before<br />\nSaturday), the Blue Jays not only<br />\nproved that they are competitive<br />\nwith Cornell, but also that they<br />\nmay very well be the best<br />\ndamned team in all of college<br />\nlacrosse. At any rate, we all will<br />\nhave the opportunity to witness<br />\nthe true \"Superbowl\" of lacrosse<br />\ntomorrow when Cornell invades<br /><br />\nCohen's Cor<br />\nLacrosse<br />\nft'<br />\nSuperbowl<br /><br />\n.Homewood.<br />\nSurprisingly enough, the<br />\nCornell-Hopkins rivalry is not as<br />\nold as most of the other<br />\nfamous Blue Jay rivalries. The<br />\nJays first met the Big Red in<br />\n1973, and each of the ensuing<br />\ncontests has been filled with<br />\nthrills,excitement and super<br />\nlacrosse action. Usually, there is a<br />\ntitle at stake when these two<br />\npowers clash. Certainly, no one<br />\ncan forget last year's cliff hanger<br />\nin New York when Cornell came<br />\nfrom behind to take a one-goal<br />\nvictory.<br />\n\"The writers usually play up<br />\nthis game the most,\" commented<br />\nCoach Ciccarone, \"because<br />\nCornell is the new boy on the<br />\nblock and we have always been<br />\nthere. This is a rivalry that will<br />\ncontinue well into the future.\"<br />\nThis is, without a doubt,<br /><br />\nComell's toughest competition of<br />\nthe year considering the fact that<br />\nthey do not play any other of the<br />\ntop five Division 1 teams.<br />\nApparently, this freak schedule is<br />\nno doing of the Big Red's coach,<br />\nRichie Moran. Maryland, Army,<br />\nNavy and Virginia just decided<br />\nthat they did not want to play<br />\nthis powerhouse.<br />\nHow does a twenty-year<br />\nveteran of Hopkins' lacrosse feel<br />\nabout such an important game?<br />\n\"If we play to our best ability,<br />\nwe will win,\" came the patented<br />\ncoach's reply to the patented<br />\nreporter's question. Chic , also<br />\nadded that tomorrow's game will<br />\nnot make or break the season.<br />\nTechnically, he is right, but one<br />\ncould tell that under that grin of<br />\nhis, Ciccarone was just as<br />\npsyched for the game as any of<br />\nhis players.
