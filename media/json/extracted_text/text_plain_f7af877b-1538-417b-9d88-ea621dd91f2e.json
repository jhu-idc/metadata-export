It is as important for us at the NewsLetter to do so as it is for any one individual or for<br />\nany one government.<br />\nAs was dramatically pointed out to us a few times<br />\nthis year, we are in effect the sole voice of the students<br />\nreadily available to the public. Also, considering the<br />\nhoarseness of other student activities and councils, it<br />\nseems that the News-Letter is the only effective channel<br />\nat Hopkins through which the administration can learn<br />\nof discontent and problems which exist among the undergraduates.<br />\nMuch to the consternation of many segments of<br />\nthis university, we have indeed been vocal; but it is imperative that we do speak out against possible wrongs,<br />\nnot only at Hopkins but in our society as well. Our<br />\nprimary purpose is not change for the sake of change,<br />\nbut rather to open minds, to make people question themselves and their beliefs, and to inform.<br />\nWe are not the university's house organ, nor will<br />\nwe ever let ourselves become that; the alumni Journal<br />\nalready exists for such a purpose. As one Hopkins alumnus wrote recently. \"If it is the truth that makes men<br />\nfree, surely it is the whole truth, warts and all, and not<br />\nsome artfully prettied-up version of the lady. Yet it is<br />\nthe truth with a heavy mask on that the Journal<br />\npresents.\"<br />\nWe wear no mask. Like liencken, the eminent Baltimore critic and scribe, who loved his city and yet mercilessly attacked its foibles and faults, we love Hopkins.<br />\nOur love for the University, although not seemingly<br />\nfathomable to many students who only get excited in the<br />\nspring (and only until our first lacrosse defeat), expresses itself precisely in our invectives against the<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nAll universities, like most everything else in this<br />\nworld, experience periods both a dynamic growth and<br />\nrethinking, and of stagnation. Our effort is directed<br />\nagainst stagnation, not only on the part of the University<br />\nbut also of the students, who can too easily degenerate<br />\ninto an apathetic and disengaged mass. President Eisenhower has moved Hopkins well out of its post-war morass<br />\nby attracting more grants to the University, by forming<br />\nnew schools and departments, and by increasing the endowment and faculty salaries. We applaud him for what<br />\nhe has done.<br />\nHowever, Hopkins has responded little to the innovation and up-dating in many areas of the University<br />\nwhich have marked the past decade in higher education.<br />\nIn a recent speech to \"students leaders,\" Dr. Eisenhower<br />\nsaid that universities which include students into policy<br />\nplanning and policy decisions are operating on a naive<br />\nassumption. Students should have no say in the workings<br />\nof the University, he said, for such decisions rest solely<br />\non the Board of Trustees. This reactionary thinking does<br />\nnot belong in a university founded with a belief in innovation and experimentation.<br />\nIn attempting to make Hopkins students more concerned not only with the immediate world of Hopkins,<br />\nbut also with the world which they will enter after graduation, we feel justified in sometimes stepping beyond<br />\nthe usual \"good-taste\" boundary. Our readership is hope.<br />\nfully more modern and more realistic than one could<br />\nfind in a non-university environment. What we are saying, in effect, is that a student newspaper, or any newspaper directed toward a privileged and presumably intellectual group of people, must direct and provoke<br />\nrather than simply relate news.<br />\nIt is with pride that we look back at our achievements of the past year. We championed and won the<br />\nright of freshmen to entertain girls in their dormitories,<br />\nof Negroes to have their hair cut in a local barbershop,<br />\nof students to receive discounts on books bought at the<br />\nUniversity store. We carried lengthy discussion on complex but much debated questions: Vietnam, the Long<br />\nRange Planning Committee's report, the honor system<br />\nand possibilities for revitalization, the role of Hopkins<br />\nin the Baltimore community, the position of fraternities<br />\nas an institution, and our latest discussion of secret<br />\nchemical and biological warfare research. These questions are far from resolved, and we shall continue to<br />\ndiscuss them in the future.<br />\nWhat we hope to achieve in the future, and what we<br />\nhope to have achieved to some degree this year, is the<br />\nestablishment of a more involved body of students, faculty and administration, working together through an<br />\neffective communications system for the general betterment of the University.

It is as important for us at the NewsLetter to do so as it is for any one individual or for<br />\nany one government.<br />\nAs was dramatically pointed out to us a few times<br />\nthis year, we are in effect the sole voice of the students<br />\nreadily available to the public. Also, considering the<br />\nhoarseness of other student activities and councils, it<br />\nseems that the News-Letter is the only effective channel<br />\nat Hopkins through which the administration can learn<br />\nof discontent and problems which exist among the undergraduates.<br />\nMuch to the consternation of many segments of<br />\nthis university, we have indeed been vocal; but it is imperative that we do speak out against possible wrongs,<br />\nnot only at Hopkins but in our society as well. Our<br />\nprimary purpose is not change for the sake of change,<br />\nbut rather to open minds, to make people question themselves and their beliefs, and to inform.<br />\nWe are not the university's house organ, nor will<br />\nwe ever let ourselves become that; the alumni Journal<br />\nalready exists for such a purpose. As one Hopkins alumnus wrote recently. \"If it is the truth that makes men<br />\nfree, surely it is the whole truth, warts and all, and not<br />\nsome artfully prettied-up version of the lady. Yet it is<br />\nthe truth with a heavy mask on that the Journal<br />\npresents.\"<br />\nWe wear no mask. Like liencken, the eminent Baltimore critic and scribe, who loved his city and yet mercilessly attacked its foibles and faults, we love Hopkins.<br />\nOur love for the University, although not seemingly<br />\nfathomable to many students who only get excited in the<br />\nspring (and only until our first lacrosse defeat), expresses itself precisely in our invectives against the<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nAll universities, like most everything else in this<br />\nworld, experience periods both a dynamic growth and<br />\nrethinking, and of stagnation. Our effort is directed<br />\nagainst stagnation, not only on the part of the University<br />\nbut also of the students, who can too easily degenerate<br />\ninto an apathetic and disengaged mass. President Eisenhower has moved Hopkins well out of its post-war morass<br />\nby attracting more grants to the University, by forming<br />\nnew schools and departments, and by increasing the endowment and faculty salaries. We applaud him for what<br />\nhe has done.<br />\nHowever, Hopkins has responded little to the innovation and up-dating in many areas of the University<br />\nwhich have marked the past decade in higher education.<br />\nIn a recent speech to \"students leaders,\" Dr. Eisenhower<br />\nsaid that universities which include students into policy<br />\nplanning and policy decisions are operating on a naive<br />\nassumption. Students should have no say in the workings<br />\nof the University, he said, for such decisions rest solely<br />\non the Board of Trustees. This reactionary thinking does<br />\nnot belong in a university founded with a belief in innovation and experimentation.<br />\nIn attempting to make Hopkins students more concerned not only with the immediate world of Hopkins,<br />\nbut also with the world which they will enter after graduation, we feel justified in sometimes stepping beyond<br />\nthe usual \"good-taste\" boundary. Our readership is hope.<br />\nfully more modern and more realistic than one could<br />\nfind in a non-university environment. What we are saying, in effect, is that a student newspaper, or any newspaper directed toward a privileged and presumably intellectual group of people, must direct and provoke<br />\nrather than simply relate news.<br />\nIt is with pride that we look back at our achievements of the past year. We championed and won the<br />\nright of freshmen to entertain girls in their dormitories,<br />\nof Negroes to have their hair cut in a local barbershop,<br />\nof students to receive discounts on books bought at the<br />\nUniversity store. We carried lengthy discussion on complex but much debated questions: Vietnam, the Long<br />\nRange Planning Committee's report, the honor system<br />\nand possibilities for revitalization, the role of Hopkins<br />\nin the Baltimore community, the position of fraternities<br />\nas an institution, and our latest discussion of secret<br />\nchemical and biological warfare research. These questions are far from resolved, and we shall continue to<br />\ndiscuss them in the future.<br />\nWhat we hope to achieve in the future, and what we<br />\nhope to have achieved to some degree this year, is the<br />\nestablishment of a more involved body of students, faculty and administration, working together through an<br />\neffective communications system for the general betterment of the University.
