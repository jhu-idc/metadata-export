The freshmen scored ten<br />\npoints by working the ball almost<br />\ndown to the soph goal line, but they<br />\ndid not succeed in getting it over.<br />\nThe feat, however, gave them ten<br />\npoints.<br />\nThe contest was thrilling to the<br />\nplayers and immensely interesting<br />\nto the few spectators who braved<br />\nthe weather. It was staged by the<br />\nStudent Council to replace the traditional football game, which was<br />\nnot played last fall because of the<br />\nlack of organization in the classes<br />\nfollowing the hazing situation. It<br />\nwas decidedly successful, and will<br />\nprobably be played again next year<br />\nas an interclass affair.

Twenty-five brawny lads<br />\npushed the leather on either side<br />\nwith such vigor that during the entire first quarter it hardly moved<br />\nmore than ten feet either way beyond the center line. But it could<br />\nbe seen that the sophomores had a<br />\ndecided advantage.<br />\nWith the beginning of the second<br />\nquarter, they attacked with a rush<br />\nand the resut was that within a few<br />\nminutes they had pushed the ball<br />\ndown the field and across their opponents' goal. Score, 35-0.<br />\nThe third and last quarters went<br />\nalong in much the same way, the<br />\nsophomores scoring another goal<br />\nand the freshmen getting ten points<br />\nfor having carried the monstrous<br />\nbulb the same number of yards into<br />\ntheir enemies' territory.

The<br />\nsubject of these lectures are given<br />\nin our University calendar.<br />\nProfessor Kittredge is a most interesting speaker. His white hair<br />\nand beard give him a rather aged<br />\nappearance, and his vigorous and<br />\nforceful speaking and clear and distinct enunciation come as an agreeable surprise. The lecturer has an<br />\nimpressive bearing and holds the<br />\nattention of the audience through-out the lecture. He shows that he<br />\nis thoroughly at home with his subject and never allows interest in<br />\nwhat he is saying to lag.<br />\nThe first lecture was delivered to<br />\na crowded hall on Monday, the<br />\nsubject being \"The Times and the<br />\nMan.\" Professor Kittredge gave a<br />\nvery clear and comprehensive summary of the age in which Chaucer<br />\nlived and a careful outline of the<br />\nlife, character and work of the poet.<br />\nThe second lecture was on \"The<br />\nBook of the Duchess,\" and the third<br />\non \"The House of Fame.\" At these<br />\nmeetings, the lecturer gave very<br />\nconcise and compact synopses of<br />\nthese individual works, and a critical discussion of their literary significance and the place they hold<br />\nin the total of Chaucer's writings.<br />\nThe, audiences at both of these lectures were large and attentive.<br />\n<br />\nThe compromise plan of reducing<br />\nthe size of the raised oval \"island\"<br />\nin the middle of Charles street in<br />\nfront of the new University was<br />\napproved by the Board of Estimates<br />\non Tuesday.<br />\nBecause of numerous complaints<br />\nmade by automobilists and others,<br />\nas a result of several accidents that<br />\noccurred there, there had been considerable discussion over the \"island.\"<br />\nThe present \"island\" will be reduced to a blunt oval thirty-six feet<br />\nlong and eighteen feet wide.

It is sincerely to be<br />\nhoped that next year will see the<br />\nti iumphant reinstallment of these<br />\ntwo class events. But by that time<br />\nthe present sophs will be eliminated<br />\nfrom the contests. Why need we<br />\nwait until next fall ? If the seniors<br />\nare going to follow the example of<br />\nthe last two graduating classes and<br />\nhave an athletic carnival at Homewood on the Saturday preceding<br />\ncommencement, why could not two<br />\nfreshman-sophomore events be included in the program? The final<br />\nexams will be over, and both classes<br />\nwill be eager to get rid of their<br />\nsurplus(?) energy. Moreover, the<br />\nsisters of the seniors will enjoy the<br />\ncontests as much as they will some<br />\nof the antics which are usually perpetrated on the spectators on such occasions. Let the Senior Week Committee give this matter their attention; and, if the suggestion here<br />\noffered seems feasible, consult with<br />\nthe presidents of the lower classes,<br />\nin order to bring about the resuscitation of these worthy traditions.<br />\nREGINAE.<br />\n<br />\nFirst Lady\u2014Too bad!

The Indians had their strongest force on<br />\nthe field, but with all their craftiness they could not fool their opponents. In dodging, passing and<br />\nbody-checking, tactics of which the<br />\nIndians are considered masters,<br />\nHopkins excelled, and, with greater<br />\nspeed and technical skill, rushed the<br />\nCarlisle men off their feet.<br />\nWhen the second half began, the<br />\nBlack and Blue players started off<br />\nwith a rush. Never has Homewood<br />\nseen better teamwork, quicker passing or more clever dodging. The<br />\nIndians seemed dumbfounded at<br />\nour evidence of skill. They tried<br />\nto rally and \"did their durndest\" to<br />\nstop the wave of defeat. But five<br />\ngoals followed, without a single<br />\nscoring by the Redmen. Captain<br />\nSutton and Huck gave the Indian<br />\nattack no chance for organization,<br />\nwhile Johnny Knipp, LaMotte and<br />\nVoshell refused to let the Indians<br />\n\"cover\" them, and neat passing and<br />\nexcellent teamwork resulted in the<br />\ndecisive victory for the Hopkins<br />\nteam.

The freshmen scored ten<br />\npoints by working the ball almost<br />\ndown to the soph goal line, but they<br />\ndid not succeed in getting it over.<br />\nThe feat, however, gave them ten<br />\npoints.<br />\nThe contest was thrilling to the<br />\nplayers and immensely interesting<br />\nto the few spectators who braved<br />\nthe weather. It was staged by the<br />\nStudent Council to replace the traditional football game, which was<br />\nnot played last fall because of the<br />\nlack of organization in the classes<br />\nfollowing the hazing situation. It<br />\nwas decidedly successful, and will<br />\nprobably be played again next year<br />\nas an interclass affair.

Twenty-five brawny lads<br />\npushed the leather on either side<br />\nwith such vigor that during the entire first quarter it hardly moved<br />\nmore than ten feet either way beyond the center line. But it could<br />\nbe seen that the sophomores had a<br />\ndecided advantage.<br />\nWith the beginning of the second<br />\nquarter, they attacked with a rush<br />\nand the resut was that within a few<br />\nminutes they had pushed the ball<br />\ndown the field and across their opponents' goal. Score, 35-0.<br />\nThe third and last quarters went<br />\nalong in much the same way, the<br />\nsophomores scoring another goal<br />\nand the freshmen getting ten points<br />\nfor having carried the monstrous<br />\nbulb the same number of yards into<br />\ntheir enemies' territory.

It is sincerely to be<br />\nhoped that next year will see the<br />\nti iumphant reinstallment of these<br />\ntwo class events. But by that time<br />\nthe present sophs will be eliminated<br />\nfrom the contests. Why need we<br />\nwait until next fall ? If the seniors<br />\nare going to follow the example of<br />\nthe last two graduating classes and<br />\nhave an athletic carnival at Homewood on the Saturday preceding<br />\ncommencement, why could not two<br />\nfreshman-sophomore events be included in the program? The final<br />\nexams will be over, and both classes<br />\nwill be eager to get rid of their<br />\nsurplus(?) energy. Moreover, the<br />\nsisters of the seniors will enjoy the<br />\ncontests as much as they will some<br />\nof the antics which are usually perpetrated on the spectators on such occasions. Let the Senior Week Committee give this matter their attention; and, if the suggestion here<br />\noffered seems feasible, consult with<br />\nthe presidents of the lower classes,<br />\nin order to bring about the resuscitation of these worthy traditions.<br />\nREGINAE.<br /><br />\nFirst Lady\u2014Too bad!

The Indians had their strongest force on<br />\nthe field, but with all their craftiness they could not fool their opponents. In dodging, passing and<br />\nbody-checking, tactics of which the<br />\nIndians are considered masters,<br />\nHopkins excelled, and, with greater<br />\nspeed and technical skill, rushed the<br />\nCarlisle men off their feet.<br />\nWhen the second half began, the<br />\nBlack and Blue players started off<br />\nwith a rush. Never has Homewood<br />\nseen better teamwork, quicker passing or more clever dodging. The<br />\nIndians seemed dumbfounded at<br />\nour evidence of skill. They tried<br />\nto rally and \"did their durndest\" to<br />\nstop the wave of defeat. But five<br />\ngoals followed, without a single<br />\nscoring by the Redmen. Captain<br />\nSutton and Huck gave the Indian<br />\nattack no chance for organization,<br />\nwhile Johnny Knipp, LaMotte and<br />\nVoshell refused to let the Indians<br />\n\"cover\" them, and neat passing and<br />\nexcellent teamwork resulted in the<br />\ndecisive victory for the Hopkins<br />\nteam.

For<br />\nseven innings it was a pitchers'<br />\nbattle between Triesler and Delaware's left-handed twirler, Geoghegan. But then both seemed to go<br />\nup in the air, and each side scored<br />\nthree runs, resulting in a tie-4 to<br />\n4. In the tenth inning Worthington<br />\nwas hit by a pitched ball, Wilson hit<br />\nout a double and Lednum singled,<br />\nbringing in the two runs that won<br />\nthe game.<br />\nWhen Delaware came to bat in<br />\nthe tenth, the first two men hit safely. Then Silvester, who had been<br />\nsubstituted for Triesler in the<br />\nseventh, did \"yeoman service\" and<br />\nstruck out the next three men up.<br />\nThe score and summary are as follows:<br /><br />\nS.W.
