Sponsored<br />\nby the Hopkins club of New York City, the concert was<br />\na huge success due to the efforts of that organization,<br />\nand the audience, largely of Hopkins graduates, was<br />\nthe most genial and enthusiastic that the club encountered in its entire season. The alumni organization arranged to put the musical group up at the<br />\nWarwick Hotel, the scene of the concert.<br />\nThe whole affair showed a living spirit in the Hopkins on the part of those residents of New York who<br />\nhave left Hopkins halls and who retain memories of<br />\nthe days spent here, and wanted to show it in a way<br />\nthat would touch personally the undergraduates of<br />\ntoday.<br />\nSo congenial was the relationship struck up between<br />\nthe alumni and undergraduates, and so successful was<br />\nthe concert itself, that assurance was given the affair<br />\nwould be repeated in years to come.<br />\n<br />\nAn Important Struggle<br />\nDr. Sigerist's talk on Spain brought to light some<br />\nphases of the situation that most of us are inclined to<br />\nomit in judging the situation.<br />\nIn the first place to clearly appreciate the recent<br />\nevents one must study the history of Spain for centuries<br />\nback and the series of development w'hich led to the<br />\npeculiar position of Spain today.
