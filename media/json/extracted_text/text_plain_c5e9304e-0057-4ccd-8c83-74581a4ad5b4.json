Towards the East of this page, you<br />\nwill observe the appearance of a<br />\nplaylet and a poem\u2014two specimens<br />\nof our all-but smothered local literature. In the past we have been almost entirely devoted to the recording of campus history, analyzing the<br />\nsame, and directing our best energies<br />\nin making of it a more ideal future.<br />\nToday's offering is more-or-less in<br />\nthe nature of an experiment to test<br />\nthe capacity of a newspaper. Can<br />\nit be adapted as a forum for the poetic to rant or the observant to<br />\ncommunicate their thoughts in some<br />\nsort of literary form? Can it be<br />\nused to reflect the fertility of these<br />\nHopkins airs by exposing creative<br />\nexpression rather than a mere journalistic account of your local scandals<br />\nor the lack of such scandals? That<br />\nall depends on our audience.<br />\nLast year, such a function was<br />\nserved by the Black and Blue Jay.<br />\nThat periodical no longer exists. And<br />\nthe most poignant reason for its demise was, apparently, the fact that<br />\na local political tyrant was insulted<br />\nby one of its caricatures, portraying<br />\nhim in the robe and garters of King<br />\nLouis XIV of France. He, like the<br />\nmemorable elephant, never forgot\u2014<br />\nand the literary organ promptly disappeared.<br />\nThe Jay, it seems, lost face. By<br />\ncriticisms from one high quarter or<br />\nanother, it fell into disrepute. Creative writing became the bunk\u2014and<br />\nsomewhat disrespectful. Now any unbiased survey of last year's magazine<br />\nwill reveal a morality\u2014white with<br />\nprimness and a disdain of the vulgar<br />\nnecessities of life such as may not<br />\nbe revealed even in the reputedly<br />\nsacred pages of Holy Writ. We must<br />\ntherefore come to the conclusion<br />\nthat creative writing has lost face<br />\nessentially because it has ignored<br />\nthis vulgarity; that is why it has become disrespectful. In this issue, we<br />\nhave taken especial pains to remedy<br />\nthe want. The contributions are reeking with carnal acceptance and even<br />\ncarnal interest Only thus can our<br />\nwriters regain their former respectability and stand a chance of regaining a respectable audience.<br />\nContributions will most certainly<br />\nbe appreciated.

We mentioned on Tuesday that a mere 1,000 spectators<br />\ntickled the turnstiles to witness Hopkins and Washington College in action. As an explanation for this<br />\npaucity of attendance, we pointed out<br />\n<br />\nthat the authorities were hopelessly<br />\ntrying to compete with the recognized<br />\nclassic attraction of the local gridiron season on that day.<br />\nBut the explanation goes deeper<br />\nthan that. It must inevitably return to the basic fact that the Association is charging a fantastic and<br />\nludicrous price of admission to<br />\nHomewood Field. One dollar and<br />\ntwenty cents ($1.20 [$1.00 \u00b1 $.20])<br />\nto everyone is the order of the day<br />\n\u2014school<br />\nchildren,<br />\ngrandparents,<br />\nmothers-in-law, and poodle dogs.<br />\nThis, in striking contrast to the modified and graded price scale which<br />\nthe Stadium officials have employed<br />\nso efficiently in recent years.<br />\nIt should be patent to the Association that neither itself, which concern is quite incidental, nor the University is profiting from such a policy. More money would certainly<br />\naccrue from stands which are packed<br />\nto capacity by local youngsters paying twenty-five or fifty cents than is<br />\nderived from the present set-up,<br />\nwhich seems to ensure the emptiness<br />\nof three-fifths of the seats.<br />\nMuch more important than this<br />\nmercenary angle, however, is the effect upon the University. With such<br />\na staggering one-price system holding sway, it is absolutely impossible<br />\nto build up any sort of public following and public support, especially<br />\nin the case of high school students.<br />\nTheir interest is stifled instantaneously by the spectre of that $1.20<br />\nwhich literally haunts Homewood<br />\nField. They, as well as adult outsiders, are under the misconception<br />\nthat the Johns Hopkins has set such<br />\na price, not knowing that the Athletic Association is an independent<br />\nunit. Such a general belief certainly<br />\nis in no way beneficial to the good<br />\nname of the University in the eyes<br />\nof the community.<br />\n$1.20, eh?

The Arts and Science catalogue 1934-35, p. 25, confirmed this<br />\nbit of news.<br />\nExperience of a number of Arts<br />\nstudents proves this is not exactly<br />\nthe truth. These students, desiring an<br />\nunderstanding of biology simply for<br />\ngeneral culture and not as a preparation for medicine or other allied<br />\nfields, did not feel inclined to spend<br />\nthe time required in the laboratory<br />\nwork connected with Biology 1C;<br />\ntherefore, on the advice of the catalogue, they registered for (Biology<br />\n11. After a week they found that they<br />\nwere called on to pay a laboratory<br />\nfee of $10 and a deposit of $5.<br />\nThis charge is evidently justified,<br />\nor will be, by the authorities on the<br />\ngrounds that the course is in the jurisdiction of the College for Teachers.<br />\nBut it seems that certain objections<br />\nto this view might be raised:<br />\n(1) A consideration of expense\u2014<br />\ncertainly if these students take the<br />\ncourse having more laboratory work,<br />\nthe cost to the University will be<br />\nhigher than if they take one in which<br />\nthe laboratory work is cut about in<br />\nhalf.<br />\n(2) Art students have been allowed to take work in the College for<br />\nTeachers without additional charges.<br />\nThere are courses now being given<br />\nin this College, which courses have<br />\na very small enrollment composed<br />\nmostly of Arts students.<br />\n(3) With the rise in tuition fees<br />\nthe additional charge for A. B.'s for<br />\ncourses in language elements given<br />\nin the Teachers College was dropped<br />\nleading the students to believe extra<br />\ncharges for laboratory would be<br />\ndropped.<br />\n(4) Biology 1T was considered to<br />\nbear the same relation to Biology 1C<br />\nas Chemistry 1C bears to Chemistry<br />\n2C, or Physics 1Ca to Physics 1C.<br />\nThus it would seem that it would<br />\nbe of advantage of the Arts and Science School (and ultimately the University as a whole) to credit the<br />\nCollege for Teachers for the laboratory expense of such students rather<br />\nthan set up a new course for this<br />\npurpose. And wouldn't it be more<br />\nexpensive if these students shifted to<br />\nBiology 1C\u2014in the way of laboratory<br />\nmaterials, and laboratory assistant<br />\ntime, to say nothing of adding to the<br />\nalready crowded condition of Biology<br />\n1C which condition now necessitates<br />\na night laboratory?<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nSTUDENT.<br />\n<br />\nCad Among The Gods<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nFROZEN TIDES<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nIf she asked, in majestic moon splendor<br />\nFor a bottle of pop and a licorice<br />\nstick<br />\nthen should I relinquish these things<br />\nCAST OF CHARACTERS<br />\nical sameness\u2014a survey, as it were, you have given me a new view of life.<br />\nunto her<br />\nof the contents of a factory-cut carGable: How the\u2014<br />\nand walk away threading through<br />\nCLARK GABLE, Apollo of Celluton, filled with canned and licentious<br />\nBrisbane (reads aloud the burden<br />\nthe mountain<br />\nloid, God of the Sun, Moon, and<br />\nbeans!<br />\nof his typewriter): \"Today.

Towards the East of this page, you<br />\nwill observe the appearance of a<br />\nplaylet and a poem\u2014two specimens<br />\nof our all-but smothered local literature. In the past we have been almost entirely devoted to the recording of campus history, analyzing the<br />\nsame, and directing our best energies<br />\nin making of it a more ideal future.<br />\nToday's offering is more-or-less in<br />\nthe nature of an experiment to test<br />\nthe capacity of a newspaper. Can<br />\nit be adapted as a forum for the poetic to rant or the observant to<br />\ncommunicate their thoughts in some<br />\nsort of literary form? Can it be<br />\nused to reflect the fertility of these<br />\nHopkins airs by exposing creative<br />\nexpression rather than a mere journalistic account of your local scandals<br />\nor the lack of such scandals? That<br />\nall depends on our audience.<br />\nLast year, such a function was<br />\nserved by the Black and Blue Jay.<br />\nThat periodical no longer exists. And<br />\nthe most poignant reason for its demise was, apparently, the fact that<br />\na local political tyrant was insulted<br />\nby one of its caricatures, portraying<br />\nhim in the robe and garters of King<br />\nLouis XIV of France. He, like the<br />\nmemorable elephant, never forgot\u2014<br />\nand the literary organ promptly disappeared.<br />\nThe Jay, it seems, lost face. By<br />\ncriticisms from one high quarter or<br />\nanother, it fell into disrepute. Creative writing became the bunk\u2014and<br />\nsomewhat disrespectful. Now any unbiased survey of last year's magazine<br />\nwill reveal a morality\u2014white with<br />\nprimness and a disdain of the vulgar<br />\nnecessities of life such as may not<br />\nbe revealed even in the reputedly<br />\nsacred pages of Holy Writ. We must<br />\ntherefore come to the conclusion<br />\nthat creative writing has lost face<br />\nessentially because it has ignored<br />\nthis vulgarity; that is why it has become disrespectful. In this issue, we<br />\nhave taken especial pains to remedy<br />\nthe want. The contributions are reeking with carnal acceptance and even<br />\ncarnal interest Only thus can our<br />\nwriters regain their former respectability and stand a chance of regaining a respectable audience.<br />\nContributions will most certainly<br />\nbe appreciated.

We mentioned on Tuesday that a mere 1,000 spectators<br />\ntickled the turnstiles to witness Hopkins and Washington College in action. As an explanation for this<br />\npaucity of attendance, we pointed out<br /><br />\nthat the authorities were hopelessly<br />\ntrying to compete with the recognized<br />\nclassic attraction of the local gridiron season on that day.<br />\nBut the explanation goes deeper<br />\nthan that. It must inevitably return to the basic fact that the Association is charging a fantastic and<br />\nludicrous price of admission to<br />\nHomewood Field. One dollar and<br />\ntwenty cents ($1.20 [$1.00 \u00b1 $.20])<br />\nto everyone is the order of the day<br />\n\u2014school<br />\nchildren,<br />\ngrandparents,<br />\nmothers-in-law, and poodle dogs.<br />\nThis, in striking contrast to the modified and graded price scale which<br />\nthe Stadium officials have employed<br />\nso efficiently in recent years.<br />\nIt should be patent to the Association that neither itself, which concern is quite incidental, nor the University is profiting from such a policy. More money would certainly<br />\naccrue from stands which are packed<br />\nto capacity by local youngsters paying twenty-five or fifty cents than is<br />\nderived from the present set-up,<br />\nwhich seems to ensure the emptiness<br />\nof three-fifths of the seats.<br />\nMuch more important than this<br />\nmercenary angle, however, is the effect upon the University. With such<br />\na staggering one-price system holding sway, it is absolutely impossible<br />\nto build up any sort of public following and public support, especially<br />\nin the case of high school students.<br />\nTheir interest is stifled instantaneously by the spectre of that $1.20<br />\nwhich literally haunts Homewood<br />\nField. They, as well as adult outsiders, are under the misconception<br />\nthat the Johns Hopkins has set such<br />\na price, not knowing that the Athletic Association is an independent<br />\nunit. Such a general belief certainly<br />\nis in no way beneficial to the good<br />\nname of the University in the eyes<br />\nof the community.<br />\n$1.20, eh? The atomizer please,<br />\nHerman.<br /><br />\nWanted: An Explanation<br />\nEditor of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nLast year your paper carried the<br />\nadvance news of an increase in tuition fees which increase, however,<br />\nmeant the abolishment of certain<br />\nother fees. Particularly those connected with athletic activities and<br />\nthose for the use of the laboratories<br />\nare meant. The Arts and Science catalogue 1934-35, p. 25, confirmed this<br />\nbit of news.<br />\nExperience of a number of Arts<br />\nstudents proves this is not exactly<br />\nthe truth. These students, desiring an<br />\nunderstanding of biology simply for<br />\ngeneral culture and not as a preparation for medicine or other allied<br />\nfields, did not feel inclined to spend<br />\nthe time required in the laboratory<br />\nwork connected with Biology 1C;<br />\ntherefore, on the advice of the catalogue, they registered for (Biology<br />\n11. After a week they found that they<br />\nwere called on to pay a laboratory<br />\nfee of $10 and a deposit of $5.<br />\nThis charge is evidently justified,<br />\nor will be, by the authorities on the<br />\ngrounds that the course is in the jurisdiction of the College for Teachers.<br />\nBut it seems that certain objections<br />\nto this view might be raised:<br />\n(1) A consideration of expense\u2014<br />\ncertainly if these students take the<br />\ncourse having more laboratory work,<br />\nthe cost to the University will be<br />\nhigher than if they take one in which<br />\nthe laboratory work is cut about in<br />\nhalf.<br />\n(2) Art students have been allowed to take work in the College for<br />\nTeachers without additional charges.<br />\nThere are courses now being given<br />\nin this College, which courses have<br />\na very small enrollment composed<br />\nmostly of Arts students.<br />\n(3) With the rise in tuition fees<br />\nthe additional charge for A. B.'s for<br />\ncourses in language elements given<br />\nin the Teachers College was dropped<br />\nleading the students to believe extra<br />\ncharges for laboratory would be<br />\ndropped.<br />\n(4) Biology 1T was considered to<br />\nbear the same relation to Biology 1C<br />\nas Chemistry 1C bears to Chemistry<br />\n2C, or Physics 1Ca to Physics 1C.<br />\nThus it would seem that it would<br />\nbe of advantage of the Arts and Science School (and ultimately the University as a whole) to credit the<br />\nCollege for Teachers for the laboratory expense of such students rather<br />\nthan set up a new course for this<br />\npurpose. And wouldn't it be more<br />\nexpensive if these students shifted to<br />\nBiology 1C\u2014in the way of laboratory<br />\nmaterials, and laboratory assistant<br />\ntime, to say nothing of adding to the<br />\nalready crowded condition of Biology<br />\n1C which condition now necessitates<br />\na night laboratory?<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nSTUDENT.<br /><br />\nCad Among The Gods<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nFROZEN TIDES<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nIf she asked, in majestic moon splendor<br />\nFor a bottle of pop and a licorice<br />\nstick<br />\nthen should I relinquish these things<br />\nCAST OF CHARACTERS<br />\nical sameness\u2014a survey, as it were, you have given me a new view of life.<br />\nunto her<br />\nof the contents of a factory-cut carGable: How the\u2014<br />\nand walk away threading through<br />\nCLARK GABLE, Apollo of Celluton, filled with canned and licentious<br />\nBrisbane (reads aloud the burden<br />\nthe mountain<br />\nloid, God of the Sun, Moon, and<br />\nbeans!<br />\nof his typewriter): \"Today.
