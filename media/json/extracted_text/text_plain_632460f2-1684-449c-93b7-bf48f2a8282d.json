It is no secret that this as a more<br />\nintensely academic institution than most and that there<br />\nis correspondingly less emphasis on the \"development\"<br />\nof the individual by the University. As pointed out by<br />\nseveral often overlooked paragraphs in the catalogue,<br />\nthe undergraduate is pretty much on his own here; until<br />\nrecently he was entirely so.<br />\n\u2022 The oft discussed, oft misunderstood notion of the<br />\nfreedom of the undergraduate at Hopkins is more than a<br />\nmyth. Given a knowledge of the academic system practiced at Homewood, and an orientation toward it, the<br />\nundergraduate can get an education here second to none.<br />\nBut he must do it on his own; there is no real guidance<br />\nand little direction imposed by the University. This is<br />\na corollary to the unparalleled freedom of action allowed<br />\nthe undergraduate, and a necessary consequence of it.<br />\nIt has become obvious that many of the men admitted to Hopkins in recent years are incapable of taking advantage of the unique opportunities offered them.<br />\nThe administration and the Committee on Undergraduate Affairs (C.O.U.G.A.) blame this, and not without<br />\njustification, on the fact that the Hopkins Community<br />\nis too amorphous. The undergraduate mind demands,<br />\nit seems, a more structured society. They have endeavored to rectify the situation to the best of their ability by<br />\nestablishing Freshman dorms and deferring rushing.<br />\nAnother approach to the problem might be a thorough re-examination of the admissions policy. The current set-up does not seem especially well designed to sift<br />\nout the 'Hopkins men,\" if there be such an animal,<br />\nfrom the mass of applicants. Too often it appears that<br />\nthe chief concern is the pursuit, often unsuccessful, of<br />\nthe well rounded, ivy type glorified by Life. We seem<br />\nto be in competition with such schools as Princeton,<br />\nYale and Brown for \"top\" prospects and this is not as<br />\nit should be. The student who thrives on a relatively<br />\nspoon-fed education at these excellent universities might<br />\nwell be totally lost at Hopkins.<br />\nIt appears that no concerted attempt is made to<br />\nselect incoming men of the maturity and specific intellectual orientation appropriate to the kind of education<br />\nHopkins tries to provide. For example, the interviews<br />\ngiven here are entirely too cursory to give a real insight<br />\ninto an applicant's character, and it is precisely such<br />\nintangibles as character and maturity which determine<br />\nwhether Freshmen will succeed at Hopkins or become<br />\none of Dr. Shaffer's many problems.<br />\nIt is impossible to condemn the admissions policy<br />\nout of hand simply because, to the best of our knowledge, none has been made public. It is, however, entirely<br />\npossible to suggest a thorough re-evaluation to insure<br />\nthat the kind of undergraduates being admitted are the<br />\nkind of undergraduates Hopkins is designed to educate.<br />\n<br />\nWho'll Answer The Riddle?<br />\nThe long planned \"big weekend\" finally is materializing and looms large on the social horizon. While the<br />\nplans are still amorphous and tentative, they present a<br />\nreal innovation on the Homewood social scene. Nevertheless they reveal a multifoldinous problem which did<br />\nnot seem to exist in the initial excitement which surrounded Joe Perrotto's plans last year.<br />\nAt first, the concept of a \"weekend\" appeared as<br />\nan elixir for all the ills of the social calendar at the University. However, the glamour and anticipation of single<br />\nbig social function cannot hide the deeper and graver<br />\nreality of the relative sterility of the Hopkins social man.<br />\nThe university totally lacks the social traditions of<br />\nthe archtypal undergraduate college. By the time the<br />\nluster of fraternity life wears off the Hopkins junior and<br />\nsenior, he is left alone to fend for himself socially just<br />\n88 he has been left along to develop his academic sensibilities. However, in the academic sphere the means to<br />\na successful education are available to the aggressive<br />\nand self realizing student; in the social realm, no such<br />\nmeans exist.<br />\nIf the university is totally committed, as it often<br />\ntells us it is, to the development of the entire individual<br />\nit will have to provide a more realistic undergraduate<br />\nsocial setup. Initial steps can he provided by loosening<br />\neven further the dormitory regulations on women.<br />\nFurther steps require monetary investment, but they<br />\nwill nontheless be inevitable in the immanent future.<br />\nIntimate lounge or \"date parlors\" for small parties and<br />\na coeducational undergraduate school have been persistent demands of News-Letter editorialists, and not<br />\nwithout warrant.<br />\nIf the present administration ignores these pleas<br />\nin the future as they have in the past, the undergraduate will have no other recourse than the demand of a<br />\nyounger and more sympathetic administrative body. That<br />\nbody which too often forgets that from our side of the<br />\nfence a large investment in education has been partially<br />\nunfulfilled may someday wake HO to their failure in<br />\ndeveloping the whole man. This ideal has been the persistent, but inconsistent goal of the public relations<br />\npropaganda which they ceaselessly spin out.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MARCH I, INA<br />\n<br />\nBarn Plays Emphasize<br />\nThe Modern Predicament<br />\n<br />\nApres le deluge.. .Playwright Edward Albee answers questions<br />\nfollowing the production of two of his incisive one act plays<br />\nSunday night.<br />\n<br />\nAlbee Discusses<br />\nDecadent Theatre<br />\nBy BOB LANDAU<br />\nAlthough Edward Albee's speech<br />\nat the Baltimore Museum of Art<br />\nlast Sunday was entitled: \"The<br />\nTheatre Today, Several Forms of<br />\nAbsurdity,\" it actually dealt with<br />\nthe playwright's function in today's theatre, his relationship<br />\nwith those who produce his play,<br />\nand most important, his obligation to the audience he writes<br />\nfor.<br />\nMr. Albee feels that a medium<br />\nlike the theatre, which allows<br />\nthe playwright the greatest freedom of expression, far more than<br />\nin the movies or TV, should serve<br />\nas an \"accurate mirror of the<br />\nnation's cultural health.\" But<br />\nAmerican playwrights of today,<br />\nare lying to their audiences. They<br />\nare not questioning and debating<br />\ntheir values, but rather applauding them, making the theatregoing public spoiled and selfdeluded.<br />\nAbsurdity Discussed<br />\nAlbee then discussed the socalled \"Theatre of the Absurd,\"<br />\nwhich started soon after World<br />\nWar II, by men like Beckett,<br />\nIonesco, and Genet, playwrights<br />\nwho saw a vital need for the<br />\nreexamination of men's values.<br />\nHe added to this his definition<br />\nof this movement, which, he<br />\nstated, depicted \"Man's attempt<br />\nto make sense for himself out<br />\nof his senseless position which<br />\nmakes no sense,\" because he can<br />\nno longer find meaning in the<br />\nmoral, political, and religious<br />\nguideposts that have been set up<br />\nfor him. Each author makes use<br />\nof the stage to project his own<br />\nvery personalized image of what<br />\nis wrong with man's place in<br />\nsociety.<br />\nTheatre Hierarchy<br />\nReturning to the Ameriran<br />\ntheatre, Albee acidly described<br />\n<br />\nthe hierarchy of the legitimate<br />\ntheatre, in wnich the most important person is the theatre<br />\nowner, whose only criteria is to<br />\nmake money. Therefore<br />\nhe<br />\nmakes sure the play that he<br />\nbooks will \"please everybody,<br />\noffend nobody, and run for a<br />\nlong time.\" Next in the hierarchy<br />\nis the producer to whom the play<br />\nis not a creative effort, but<br />\nmerely a \"property.\" Next comes<br />\nthe big star, famous for rewriting plays, because the author's<br />\nlines do not suit him or maintain<br />\nhis image. The director also rewrites, if he feels he can help<br />\nthe play \"sell.\"<br />\nReality Hidden<br />\nDead last, says Albee, comes<br />\nthe playwright, caught up in a<br />\ncompetitive, money-mad system.<br />\nThe fact that he may have something to say to his audience is<br />\nvery unimportant. The result is<br />\na Broadway \"top heavy\" in plays<br />\nin which the ruling factors are<br />\ncommercialism and big business.<br />\nTherefore we can understand<br />\nwhen Albee claims that in view<br />\nof these conditions, the \"theatre<br />\nof the Absurd\" is the true<br />\ntheatre of reality, and the<br />\ntheatre as we know it, with its<br />\n(Continued on Page 5)<br />\n<br />\nBook Review<br />\n<br />\nSalinger Revives 'Seymour'<br />\nBy JEFFREY E.

Also included<br />\nare rights to free museum ad-<br />\n<br />\nInter-personal communication<br />\nand the modern predicament are<br />\nthe topics of the two Albee plays<br />\ncurrently on the stage of the<br />\nbarn theatre. \"The Death of<br />\nBessie Smith\" and \"The American Dream' are attempts to jar<br />\nthe audience out of a lethargic<br />\nunwillingness to solve the problems of the alienated individual<br />\nin modern society.<br />\nAs works of the post-existential era, Albee's plays are optimistic in that they climax in the<br />\nrevealing of opportunities for<br />\nauthentic relationships just as<br />\nthey hopefully produce catharsis<br />\nin the playgoer and purge him<br />\nof the troubles of social living.<br />\nThey readily transcend the<br />\nlimitations of their specific situations so that the American<br />\nDream becomes the Universal<br />\nReality, the frustration of sexual desires enlarges to general<br />\nsterility and the misoriented<br />\ncharacters assume the greater<br />\nsymbolic significance of the<br />\ngeneral social and moral \"misorder\" of the contemporary<br />\nworld.<br />\nThe playshop's presentations<br />\nof the two plays reilect the differences in stylization of the two<br />\nplays and of the two directors<br />\nwho interpreted them. \"The<br />\nDeath of Bessie Smith,\" directed<br />\nby Frances Bowen, utilizes the<br />\nlimited facilities of the barn<br />\ntheatre to its capacity. A proscenium of simple decoration<br />\ntransforms lighting and audience imagination into five separate settings. Characterization is<br />\nnaturalistic and equisitly portrays the pathos and enigmas<br />\nof Mr. Albees personnages.<br />\nWhile \"The Death of Bessie<br />\nSmith\" presents the inability of<br />\nsociety's doctors to solve the<br />\nsocial and moral ills of an age<br />\nwhose problems require new<br />\nAmerican<br />\n\"T h e<br />\nsolutions,<br />\nDream\" succinctly and powerful,<br />\nly reveals the problems of a generation and a world whose value<br />\nsystem is topsided. Its oecipa<br />\n\"Daudy\" who marries a materialist \"Mommy\" represents the<br />\ntwentieth century man par-excellence.<br />\nThe \"American Dream\" which<br />\nsmacks of the Theatre of the<br />\nAbsurd, was surrealistically and<br />\nto my view inadequately directed<br />\nby Lester Wolf. The stark symbolization of Albee's play invited<br />\na reading which was extreme in<br />\nits fragmentation and lack of<br />\nhuman emotion. While the approach had a startling affect, it<br />\nalso destroyed the empathic<br />\nlures of a more naturalistic<br />\nrendering. (E.M.)<br />\n<br />\nmission.

This is why his theatre is<br />\nso uncreative. Artificial values<br />\nare substituted for real values;<br />\nthere is an emphasis on surface<br />\nappearance, and the result is a<br />\ncomplacent attitude of \"let's do<br />\nwhat was good last year\" that<br />\nstifles any true emotional communication or creative aspirations. This is what Albee was<br />\ndoing in this talk also, challenging his audience's values, daring<br />\nthem to go to the theatre to<br />\nlearn or to be upset, rather than<br />\nto be coddled.<br />\nFollowing this Mr. Albee held a<br />\nquestion and answer session,<br />\nwhich he seemed to turn into<br />\none of his Virginia Woolf games.<br />\nThis one might well have been<br />\nentitled \"Annihilate the audience.\"<br />\n<br />\nthe maya of us anti-christs and<br />\nunknowers of Unknowing.

The wrestling team, if<br />\nthere was going to be one, was<br />\nnot going to win any meets.<br />\nBt was going to have to forfeit a<br />\nnumber of bouts due to insufficient manpower; it wasn't even<br />\ngoing to come close to winning<br />\nany meets. Voluntary Red Cross<br />\nworkers were recruited to carry<br />\nthe soon-to-be-decimated<br />\noff<br />\nHopkins wrestlers,<br />\nWell, the official season is over,<br />\nand Hopkins wound up 4-5. This<br />\nis not a world shatterring mark,<br />\nbut it is an improvement over<br />\nthe 2-7 mark posted last year,<br />\nand a definite improvement over<br />\nthe expected 0-9.<br />\nGive Us More<br />\nIn retrospect, the question is<br />\nnot so much How Hopkins managed to win 4, but rather how<br />\nthey managed to avoid winning<br />\n6. This is not at all intended to<br />\nbe critical. The squad was made<br />\nup almost entirely of sophomores, and the lack of experience of these sophomores<br />\nmade Winning 6 an impossibility, since, being inexperienced, they were bound to make<br />\nmistakes. An error, coming from<br />\ninexperience, gave Loyola a 1716 win in a match which should<br />\nhave been a 19-12 Hopkins victory. Coach Mickey Cochrane<br />\nwent on the record as saying<br />\nthat if the team had performed<br />\nas well against Dickinson as it<br />\ndid against Delaware, it would<br />\nhave won that match. The reasons that the squad did not do<br />\nso were minor injuries, tough<br />\nbreaks, and inexperience.<br />\nFans, Fighters<br />\nHopkins, however, possesses a<br />\nnumber of fine wrestlers and<br />\none extraordinary wrestling fan.<br />\nThe former have kept winning,<br />\nand the overall point total for<br />\nthe year is in Hopkins favor, and<br />\nthe latter is so enthusiastic that<br />\nhe was drafted onto the squad<br />\nlast year, when injuries had depleted the grappling ranks.<br />\nA lot of credit has to go out to<br />\ncaptain Ron Davis.

It is no secret that this as a more<br />\nintensely academic institution than most and that there<br />\nis correspondingly less emphasis on the \"development\"<br />\nof the individual by the University. As pointed out by<br />\nseveral often overlooked paragraphs in the catalogue,<br />\nthe undergraduate is pretty much on his own here; until<br />\nrecently he was entirely so.<br />\n\u2022 The oft discussed, oft misunderstood notion of the<br />\nfreedom of the undergraduate at Hopkins is more than a<br />\nmyth. Given a knowledge of the academic system practiced at Homewood, and an orientation toward it, the<br />\nundergraduate can get an education here second to none.<br />\nBut he must do it on his own; there is no real guidance<br />\nand little direction imposed by the University. This is<br />\na corollary to the unparalleled freedom of action allowed<br />\nthe undergraduate, and a necessary consequence of it.<br />\nIt has become obvious that many of the men admitted to Hopkins in recent years are incapable of taking advantage of the unique opportunities offered them.<br />\nThe administration and the Committee on Undergraduate Affairs (C.O.U.G.A.) blame this, and not without<br />\njustification, on the fact that the Hopkins Community<br />\nis too amorphous. The undergraduate mind demands,<br />\nit seems, a more structured society. They have endeavored to rectify the situation to the best of their ability by<br />\nestablishing Freshman dorms and deferring rushing.<br />\nAnother approach to the problem might be a thorough re-examination of the admissions policy. The current set-up does not seem especially well designed to sift<br />\nout the 'Hopkins men,\" if there be such an animal,<br />\nfrom the mass of applicants. Too often it appears that<br />\nthe chief concern is the pursuit, often unsuccessful, of<br />\nthe well rounded, ivy type glorified by Life. We seem<br />\nto be in competition with such schools as Princeton,<br />\nYale and Brown for \"top\" prospects and this is not as<br />\nit should be. The student who thrives on a relatively<br />\nspoon-fed education at these excellent universities might<br />\nwell be totally lost at Hopkins.<br />\nIt appears that no concerted attempt is made to<br />\nselect incoming men of the maturity and specific intellectual orientation appropriate to the kind of education<br />\nHopkins tries to provide. For example, the interviews<br />\ngiven here are entirely too cursory to give a real insight<br />\ninto an applicant's character, and it is precisely such<br />\nintangibles as character and maturity which determine<br />\nwhether Freshmen will succeed at Hopkins or become<br />\none of Dr. Shaffer's many problems.<br />\nIt is impossible to condemn the admissions policy<br />\nout of hand simply because, to the best of our knowledge, none has been made public. It is, however, entirely<br />\npossible to suggest a thorough re-evaluation to insure<br />\nthat the kind of undergraduates being admitted are the<br />\nkind of undergraduates Hopkins is designed to educate.<br /><br />\nWho'll Answer The Riddle?<br />\nThe long planned \"big weekend\" finally is materializing and looms large on the social horizon. While the<br />\nplans are still amorphous and tentative, they present a<br />\nreal innovation on the Homewood social scene. Nevertheless they reveal a multifoldinous problem which did<br />\nnot seem to exist in the initial excitement which surrounded Joe Perrotto's plans last year.<br />\nAt first, the concept of a \"weekend\" appeared as<br />\nan elixir for all the ills of the social calendar at the University. However, the glamour and anticipation of single<br />\nbig social function cannot hide the deeper and graver<br />\nreality of the relative sterility of the Hopkins social man.<br />\nThe university totally lacks the social traditions of<br />\nthe archtypal undergraduate college. By the time the<br />\nluster of fraternity life wears off the Hopkins junior and<br />\nsenior, he is left alone to fend for himself socially just<br />\n88 he has been left along to develop his academic sensibilities. However, in the academic sphere the means to<br />\na successful education are available to the aggressive<br />\nand self realizing student; in the social realm, no such<br />\nmeans exist.<br />\nIf the university is totally committed, as it often<br />\ntells us it is, to the development of the entire individual<br />\nit will have to provide a more realistic undergraduate<br />\nsocial setup. Initial steps can he provided by loosening<br />\neven further the dormitory regulations on women.<br />\nFurther steps require monetary investment, but they<br />\nwill nontheless be inevitable in the immanent future.<br />\nIntimate lounge or \"date parlors\" for small parties and<br />\na coeducational undergraduate school have been persistent demands of News-Letter editorialists, and not<br />\nwithout warrant.<br />\nIf the present administration ignores these pleas<br />\nin the future as they have in the past, the undergraduate will have no other recourse than the demand of a<br />\nyounger and more sympathetic administrative body. That<br />\nbody which too often forgets that from our side of the<br />\nfence a large investment in education has been partially<br />\nunfulfilled may someday wake HO to their failure in<br />\ndeveloping the whole man. This ideal has been the persistent, but inconsistent goal of the public relations<br />\npropaganda which they ceaselessly spin out.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MARCH I, INA<br /><br />\nBarn Plays Emphasize<br />\nThe Modern Predicament<br /><br />\nApres le deluge.. .Playwright Edward Albee answers questions<br />\nfollowing the production of two of his incisive one act plays<br />\nSunday night.<br /><br />\nAlbee Discusses<br />\nDecadent Theatre<br />\nBy BOB LANDAU<br />\nAlthough Edward Albee's speech<br />\nat the Baltimore Museum of Art<br />\nlast Sunday was entitled: \"The<br />\nTheatre Today, Several Forms of<br />\nAbsurdity,\" it actually dealt with<br />\nthe playwright's function in today's theatre, his relationship<br />\nwith those who produce his play,<br />\nand most important, his obligation to the audience he writes<br />\nfor.<br />\nMr. Albee feels that a medium<br />\nlike the theatre, which allows<br />\nthe playwright the greatest freedom of expression, far more than<br />\nin the movies or TV, should serve<br />\nas an \"accurate mirror of the<br />\nnation's cultural health.\" But<br />\nAmerican playwrights of today,<br />\nare lying to their audiences. They<br />\nare not questioning and debating<br />\ntheir values, but rather applauding them, making the theatregoing public spoiled and selfdeluded.<br />\nAbsurdity Discussed<br />\nAlbee then discussed the socalled \"Theatre of the Absurd,\"<br />\nwhich started soon after World<br />\nWar II, by men like Beckett,<br />\nIonesco, and Genet, playwrights<br />\nwho saw a vital need for the<br />\nreexamination of men's values.<br />\nHe added to this his definition<br />\nof this movement, which, he<br />\nstated, depicted \"Man's attempt<br />\nto make sense for himself out<br />\nof his senseless position which<br />\nmakes no sense,\" because he can<br />\nno longer find meaning in the<br />\nmoral, political, and religious<br />\nguideposts that have been set up<br />\nfor him. Each author makes use<br />\nof the stage to project his own<br />\nvery personalized image of what<br />\nis wrong with man's place in<br />\nsociety.<br />\nTheatre Hierarchy<br />\nReturning to the Ameriran<br />\ntheatre, Albee acidly described<br /><br />\nthe hierarchy of the legitimate<br />\ntheatre, in wnich the most important person is the theatre<br />\nowner, whose only criteria is to<br />\nmake money. Therefore<br />\nhe<br />\nmakes sure the play that he<br />\nbooks will \"please everybody,<br />\noffend nobody, and run for a<br />\nlong time.\" Next in the hierarchy<br />\nis the producer to whom the play<br />\nis not a creative effort, but<br />\nmerely a \"property.\" Next comes<br />\nthe big star, famous for rewriting plays, because the author's<br />\nlines do not suit him or maintain<br />\nhis image.

LICKSON<br />\nRAISE HIGH THE ROOF BEAM,<br />\nCARPENTERS and SEYMOUR<br />\n\u2014AN INTRODUCTION: J. D.<br />\nSalinger. Little, Brown and<br />\nCompany, $4.00.<br />\nOnce more J. D. Sallinger gives<br />\na taste of Seymour Glass,<br />\nflat perhaps for old New Yorker<br /><br />\nMuseum Offers Cut Rates<br />\nIn a special concession to<br />\nmembers of the University community the Museum of Modern<br />\nArt in New York is offering a<br />\nStudent Group Membership Plan<br />\nto enhance the existing student<br />\ninterest in the visual arts.<br />\nThrough this plan, students and<br />\nfaculty may join the Museum at<br />\na reduced annual rate of 10 dollars between now and Monday,<br />\nMarch 18th.<br />\nThe plan affords all the privileges of regular Non-Resident<br />\nMembership including receipt of<br />\n4 books and discounts on Museum publications. Also included<br />\nare rights to free museum ad-<br /><br />\nInter-personal communication<br />\nand the modern predicament are<br />\nthe topics of the two Albee plays<br />\ncurrently on the stage of the<br />\nbarn theatre. \"The Death of<br />\nBessie Smith\" and \"The American Dream' are attempts to jar<br />\nthe audience out of a lethargic<br />\nunwillingness to solve the problems of the alienated individual<br />\nin modern society.<br />\nAs works of the post-existential era, Albee's plays are optimistic in that they climax in the<br />\nrevealing of opportunities for<br />\nauthentic relationships just as<br />\nthey hopefully produce catharsis<br />\nin the playgoer and purge him<br />\nof the troubles of social living.<br />\nThey readily transcend the<br />\nlimitations of their specific situations so that the American<br />\nDream becomes the Universal<br />\nReality, the frustration of sexual desires enlarges to general<br />\nsterility and the misoriented<br />\ncharacters assume the greater<br />\nsymbolic significance of the<br />\ngeneral social and moral \"misorder\" of the contemporary<br />\nworld.<br />\nThe playshop's presentations<br />\nof the two plays reilect the differences in stylization of the two<br />\nplays and of the two directors<br />\nwho interpreted them. \"The<br />\nDeath of Bessie Smith,\" directed<br />\nby Frances Bowen, utilizes the<br />\nlimited facilities of the barn<br />\ntheatre to its capacity. A proscenium of simple decoration<br />\ntransforms lighting and audience imagination into five separate settings. Characterization is<br />\nnaturalistic and equisitly portrays the pathos and enigmas<br />\nof Mr. Albees personnages.<br />\nWhile \"The Death of Bessie<br />\nSmith\" presents the inability of<br />\nsociety's doctors to solve the<br />\nsocial and moral ills of an age<br />\nwhose problems require new<br />\nAmerican<br />\n\"T h e<br />\nsolutions,<br />\nDream\" succinctly and powerful,<br />\nly reveals the problems of a generation and a world whose value<br />\nsystem is topsided. Its oecipa<br />\n\"Daudy\" who marries a materialist \"Mommy\" represents the<br />\ntwentieth century man par-excellence.<br />\nThe \"American Dream\" which<br />\nsmacks of the Theatre of the<br />\nAbsurd, was surrealistically and<br />\nto my view inadequately directed<br />\nby Lester Wolf. The stark symbolization of Albee's play invited<br />\na reading which was extreme in<br />\nits fragmentation and lack of<br />\nhuman emotion. While the approach had a startling affect, it<br />\nalso destroyed the empathic<br />\nlures of a more naturalistic<br />\nrendering. (E.M.)<br /><br />\nmission. The plan goes into effect when 20 more students and<br />\nfaculty members enroll from the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nMembers may use the Museum<br />\nLibrary which is equipped with<br />\nthe worlds foremost collection of<br />\nperiodicals books and reference<br />\nfiles on modern art. In addition<br />\nto the Museums own famous collection, the special exhibitions<br />\noffered this spring are: \"Le<br />\nCorbusier: Buildings In Europe<br />\nand India,\" and one man shows<br />\nof the works of Emil Nolde and<br />\nAuguste Rodin.

This is why his theatre is<br />\nso uncreative. Artificial values<br />\nare substituted for real values;<br />\nthere is an emphasis on surface<br />\nappearance, and the result is a<br />\ncomplacent attitude of \"let's do<br />\nwhat was good last year\" that<br />\nstifles any true emotional communication or creative aspirations. This is what Albee was<br />\ndoing in this talk also, challenging his audience's values, daring<br />\nthem to go to the theatre to<br />\nlearn or to be upset, rather than<br />\nto be coddled.<br />\nFollowing this Mr. Albee held a<br />\nquestion and answer session,<br />\nwhich he seemed to turn into<br />\none of his Virginia Woolf games.<br />\nThis one might well have been<br />\nentitled \"Annihilate the audience.\"<br /><br />\nthe maya of us anti-christs and<br />\nunknowers of Unknowing.

It may be said that<br />\nhe died to save us all, especially<br />\nthe Glass family, extra-specially<br />\nBuddy Glass. The first story in<br /><br />\nthis volume is sacred and consistent with the beloved memory<br />\nof Seymour. In it he is the shaded, martyred, vague hero, who<br />\nrefuses to be seen or known. Seymour was a human being, and it<br />\nit feasible that he could have<br />\nbroken the earthly bounds of<br />\nMiami Beach etc., but why does<br />\nBuddy, alias J. D.

The wrestling team, if<br />\nthere was going to be one, was<br />\nnot going to win any meets.<br />\nBt was going to have to forfeit a<br />\nnumber of bouts due to insufficient manpower; it wasn't even<br />\ngoing to come close to winning<br />\nany meets. Voluntary Red Cross<br />\nworkers were recruited to carry<br />\nthe soon-to-be-decimated<br />\noff<br />\nHopkins wrestlers,<br />\nWell, the official season is over,<br />\nand Hopkins wound up 4-5. This<br />\nis not a world shatterring mark,<br />\nbut it is an improvement over<br />\nthe 2-7 mark posted last year,<br />\nand a definite improvement over<br />\nthe expected 0-9.<br />\nGive Us More<br />\nIn retrospect, the question is<br />\nnot so much How Hopkins managed to win 4, but rather how<br />\nthey managed to avoid winning<br />\n6. This is not at all intended to<br />\nbe critical. The squad was made<br />\nup almost entirely of sophomores, and the lack of experience of these sophomores<br />\nmade Winning 6 an impossibility, since, being inexperienced, they were bound to make<br />\nmistakes. An error, coming from<br />\ninexperience, gave Loyola a 1716 win in a match which should<br />\nhave been a 19-12 Hopkins victory. Coach Mickey Cochrane<br />\nwent on the record as saying<br />\nthat if the team had performed<br />\nas well against Dickinson as it<br />\ndid against Delaware, it would<br />\nhave won that match. The reasons that the squad did not do<br />\nso were minor injuries, tough<br />\nbreaks, and inexperience.<br />\nFans, Fighters<br />\nHopkins, however, possesses a<br />\nnumber of fine wrestlers and<br />\none extraordinary wrestling fan.<br />\nThe former have kept winning,<br />\nand the overall point total for<br />\nthe year is in Hopkins favor, and<br />\nthe latter is so enthusiastic that<br />\nhe was drafted onto the squad<br />\nlast year, when injuries had depleted the grappling ranks.<br />\nA lot of credit has to go out to<br />\ncaptain Ron Davis. The only<br />\nsenior, and the only returning<br />\nletterman, Davis has had multiple responsibilities this year,<br />\nand has done well. He has a<br />\nwinning record, and has also<br />\nmanaged to act as a stabilizing<br />\ninfluence on the sophomores,<br />\nperhaps his most important<br />\nfunction as captain.<br /><br />\nSophomores shine<br />\nThe real wrestling story, however, lies in the sophomores, and<br />\nHopkins has a slew of fine<br />\nMike<br />\nwrestlers.<br />\nsophomore<br />\nSchneider, Frank Szoka, John<br />\nGlascock, Joe Viglotti, Mel Ulmer, and Jim Fisher have all<br />\nturned in outstanding perform a nces.<br />\nUlmer is the squad's lone seri\u2022u.s injury.

Unfortunately for the opp&amp;sition, he wrestles at least<br />\nas well as he talks. He has a fine<br />\ncapacity for keeping cool under<br />\npressure, and an anonymous<br />\nmember of the team asserts that<br />\nit is \"impossible to psych him<br />\nout.\" As strong as he is collected, and as collected as he is<br />\ntalkative, which is saying a good<br />\ndeal, Szoka looms large in future<br />\nwrestling plans. Like Fisher, he,<br />\ntoo, may be a future conference<br />\nchampion.<br />\nQuiet Efficiency<br />\nThe three quieter members of<br />\nthe sophomore squad, Viglotti,<br />\nGlascock, and Schneider, are all<br />\nefficient wrestlers.

Glascock,<br />\nshort and strong, has often<br />\nwrestled against opponents much<br />\ntaller than he, but he has lost<br />\nonly one bout. Viglotti has to<br />\novercome similar handicaps, and<br />\nboth have been among the<br />\nmost consistent Hopkins ,wrestlers. If all three continue at<br />\ntheir present rate of development, they will be virtually unbeatable next year.<br />\nHopkins' flaw all year has<br />\nbeen in the upper weight classes.<br />\nSteve Roth and Dennis Donnelly,<br />\nhowever, have done fine jobs,<br />\nalthough they have not, unfortunately, frequently been rewarded with wins.
