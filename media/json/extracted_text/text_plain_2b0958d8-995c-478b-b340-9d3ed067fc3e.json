I did that in<br />\nthe case of the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs.\"<br />\nCalling last Friday's News-Letter editorial \"simply wrong,\" Gordon pointed<br />\nout that he \"accepted a significant portion of their proposals, indeed, really<br />\nused their draft as the base of this<br />\nnew draft.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"No\"<br />\nWhen asked if he would consider a<br />\npetition which simply asked that his<br />\nProposal be changed to be identical to<br />\nthat submitted by the SAC, Gordon stated \"unless they produce new reasons,<br />\nwhich were more persuasive than the<br />\nold reasons, no.\"<br />\nHe went on to say that \"this is an<br />\nhypothesis which seems to me really<br />\nrather unlikely.\" Gordon further stated that he \"would be impressed\" if a<br />\nsignificant number of students and faculty supported the reasoning of the<br />\nSAC.<br />\nGordon said that the various reactions<br />\nto his proposal \"seem to be trying to<br />\ncreate confrontations, sharp confrontations...\" He continued stating that he<br />\n\"tried to deal with the issues, as objectively as possible, and I hope that<br />\n<br />\nthe News-Letter would learn to do the<br />\nsame.''<br />\n<br />\n\"Distinguished Journal\"<br />\nGordon pointed out that if he \"were<br />\nreally as arbitrary as your distinguished<br />\n,ournal suggests, I could just have drafted something myself and put it out... It<br />\nseems to me that I have been leaning<br />\nover rather strenously to avoid being<br />\narbitrary... The most arbitrary thing<br />\nwould be to just keep all the power,<br />\nwhich I have at the present time and<br />\nexercise it arbitrarily. I don't believe<br />\nin the arbitrary use of power and I must<br />\nsay that it would be nice if this point<br />\nwere recognized.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the possibility of<br />\ndelaying a final decision on this matter<br />\nuntil after the question of governance<br />\nhas been decided, Gordon mentioned that<br />\nthe new governing body could amend the<br />\ncode and that \"on the whole, we would<br />\nbe better off to have a policy formally<br />\nin effect.\"<br />\n\"A<br />\n<br />\nKey Point\"<br />\n<br />\nIn referring to the relationship between his proposal and that of the SAC,<br />\nGordon stated \"The differences are<br />\nnot so large, this is perhaps a key<br />\npoint. I find it a little difficult to see<br />\nthat any of the particular differences<br />\nhere between the SAC committee draft<br />\nand my draft as transcendental, vital<br />\nIssues.\"<br />\n<br />\nsence of two undergraduate students and two graduate<br />\nstudents on the Board opposite three faculty members<br />\nwould give the students a majority. \"Graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students have very diverse interests\",<br />\nsaid Cleary. They are not a unified body, he suggested, and thus would not form a majority.<br />\nOn the expulsion issue, Cleary again said that it was<br />\nthe protection of ,the students that was at stake. He<br />\nstated that the best way to protect students was to limit<br />\nthe sanctions that could be imposed by the Review<br />\nBoard.<br />\n<br />\nCleary indicated that if President Gordon did not<br />\nrespond to the petition, he would be prepared to use<br />\nother channels. \"I'm sure we could handle a demonstration\", he said.<br />\n<br />\nPresent Student Conduct Code<br />\nUnearthed from`Hiding Place'<br />\nIn Student Council Constitution<br />\nThe Gentleman's Code and Student<br />\nCouncil Constitution contain clauses<br />\nwhich cast doubt on the validity of President Gordon's publicly announced reasons for wanting a Conduct Code.<br />\nLast year Dr. Gordon charged an ad<br />\nhoc Committee on Governance with writing a Conduct Code for the University<br />\nbecause, he claimed, none existed. He<br />\nsaid his wish was to delegate some of<br />\nhis authority to other persons in the<br />\nHopkins community.<br />\n<br />\nSystem Governs<br />\nThe constitution, written last year by<br />\nan SC Committee chaired by Manuel<br />\nRodriguez, states that all student behavior shall be in accordance with the<br />\nGentleman's Code. The code states that<br />\n\"The Honor System governs not only<br />\nconduct in class and examination rooms<br />\nbut also those aspects of behavior among<br />\nstudents on the campus...which might in<br />\nany way compromise or undermine the<br />\npresent valued ethical concept of Hopkins men.\"<br />\nThe Honor Commission controls academic breaches of the Gentleman's Code.<br />\nOnly students are permitted to sit on<br />\nthe Commission, and its decisions are<br />\n<br />\nnot subject to review by any higher placed members of the University.<br />\nFor non-academic behavior, the SC<br />\nConstitution states that the Student Council is to have jurisdiction over offenders.<br />\nBehavior by any undergraduate student or<br />\nstudents is subject to investigation and<br />\ndecision by the SC, according to Article<br />\nIV, section 2.<br />\n<br />\nConstitution Revised<br />\nThe constitution was revised and ratified by the study body last spring. However, the individual parts affecting conduct were taken from the previous<br />\nconstitution, which had been in effect for<br />\nseveral years. The Honor System and<br />\nGentleman's Code have been in existence<br />\nsince the founding of the University.<br />\nWhen Dr. Gordon announced his decision to have a formal Conduct Code, the<br />\nSC did not inform him of the already<br />\nexisting rules of conduct. No SC offic ,rs or representatives have brought the<br />\nconstitution to light this year either.<br />\nThe SC Constitution only effects undergraduate students.

At that time he missed his second<br />\nmeeting of the year without an excuse.<br />\nFax, who incurred his second absence this past Monday,<br />\nwas unable to attend the meeting due to personal affairs<br />\nbut could not contact Guess before the meeting to obtain<br />\nan excuse. The next day, when notified of the reasons<br />\nfor Fax's absence, the President changed the status of<br />\nthe roll to an excused absence.<br />\n<br />\nOne Nigh ter<br />\nGuess explained after the meeting that his suspension<br />\nof Stewart and Fax was only for the one night so that the<br />\nCouncil could take action on the discipline issue immediately.<br />\nThere is no provision under which the president has<br />\nto suspend or expel a member--the delinquent is off<br />\nthe council regardless of any action the president may<br />\ntake.<br />\nBefore this past Monday SC treasurer Jon Globig had<br />\naccumulated two unexcused absences, John Marron had<br />\nthree, Greg Szoka had two and seven other members<br />\nhad one apiece.<br />\nGlobig received his second absence on the roll book<br />\non February 2. His activities as Treasurer should have<br />\nterminated after he missed that meeting.<br />\nMarron and Szoka, who are, respectively, presidents<br />\nof the senior and junior clas.se, should also have discontinued their accivities with the SC due to accumulat-<br />\n<br />\ned absences. Marron received his second absence on<br />\nNovember 3 and Szoka got his on February 2.<br />\nWhether Marron and Szoka can continue as presidents<br />\nof their classes is not stated in the SC Constitution.<br />\nRegardless, they should no longer participate as members of the Council.<br />\nAs Treasurer of the SC, Globig sits on the Student<br />\nActivities Committe which decides allocations of financies to student organizations. The Activities Committee chooses the Treasurer of the Student Council in<br />\nthe spring of each year, and would, apparently, choose<br />\na replacement for Globig if he is forced off the SC due<br />\nto absences.<br />\nAt Monday's meeting Guess announced that all of<br />\nGlobig's unexcused absences should be changed to excused. At that time he refused to explain why, but the<br />\nnext day said that because Globig does so much work<br />\nfor the Activities Committee, he could be \"excused for<br />\nmeetings of the Council he has missed.\" He did not<br />\nexplain why he had not, previously excused Globig for<br />\nabsences.<br />\n<br />\nThere is no prescribed means by which the class<br />\npresidents can be replaced if they are put off the SC,<br />\nthus their positions would remain vacant.<br />\nNone of the persons who have incurred two or more<br />\nabsences have made any gestures indicating they intend<br />\nto resign from the SC.

In his<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\njunior year, the history major must take<br />\nNews<br />\nan<br />\nUndergraduate<br />\nSeminar. \"Oh, boy,\"<br />\nFeature<br />\nsays the youthful<br />\nmajor in Southern<br />\nHistory, \"Ah'll take<br />\nme a seminar inSouthern History.\"<br />\n\"My word\", exclaims the Medieval<br />\nHistory major. \"Methinks to take a<br />\ncourse in the Middle Ages.\"<br />\n\"Surprise\", says the History Department. \"Both of you have to take Victorian<br />\nImperialism, which is the only Undergrad<br />\nSeminar offered.\"<br />\nAbe Kronsberg,a junior and ex-history<br />\n<br />\nmajor commented, \"This course discourages you from majoring in history,<br />\nunless youwant to go into the profession.\"<br />\nThere is no way a liberal arts major can<br />\nmajor in history.<br />\n\"Most people found the course terribly<br />\nboring. Victorian Imperialism does not<br />\nhave the greatest books in the world<br />\nwritten about it.\" I wanted to go for a<br />\nPh. D. in History, but I gave up because<br />\nI didn't want to write a long paper on a<br />\nsubject that I never had any interest in.\"<br />\nAnother member of the class stated,<br />\n\"I majored in American History, but I<br />\nhad to take Victorian Imperialism. I<br />\ndidn't think the course was either interesting or relevant, and I wasn't familiar with its specifics. A Seminar cannot<br />\nbe successful if the topic is irrelevent.<br />\nI'm sorry that the Deparmtner can't bring<br />\nitself to a different arrangement. I am<br />\nnot upset withCohen (the course's instructor) or the Seminar,for the requirement--I am upset with the system.\"<br />\nKronsberg: \"I would blame the problems of the course on the people who<br />\nwere in it. Noboby complained to Dr.<br />\nCohen until almost the end of the semester. The students got what they deserved.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Department is aware of problems<br />\nassociated with the seminars and plans<br />\na whole new program beginning next fall.<br />\nDr. Alfred Chandler, Chairman of the<br />\nHistory Department, outlined the plan.<br />\n\"Next year, the seminars will become<br />\nstructures withinwhich the students learn<br />\nto write and study history. During the<br />\nfirst semester different approaches to<br />\nhistory will be studied.<br />\nDepartment<br />\nmembers will discuss great books with<br />\nthe students. The big change occurs in the<br />\nspring, when the class breaks up into<br />\ntutorials, with no more than two students<br />\nworking with a professor.\"<br />\nDr. David Cohen, who teaches African<br />\nHistory and who taught the VictorianImperialism course said that the change<br />\nin the style of the seminars was brought<br />\nabout by two factors. \"The number of<br />\nhistory majors has increased to twenty,<br />\nthus making the seminars unwiedly. Also<br />\nthere is an increasing maturity of students. They are coming out of much<br />\nstronger<br />\nhigh school history backgrounds.\"<br />\n<br />\nBad Riting<br />\nAnother problem plaguing the department is the inferior quality of writing<br />\nexhibited by the students. Because of<br />\nthis, the tutorials will place a much<br />\ngreater emphases on intensive writing<br />\nand criticism. \"There is a terrible problem in undergraduate writing,\" said<br />\nChandler. \"The high schools don't teach<br />\nhow to structure a paper. It's surprising how many papers don't have a beginning or end.\"<br />\nCohen observed, \"Students have trouble setting thoughts down on paper. I'm<br />\nnot the only one in the department who<br />\nhas failed students for incompetence in<br />\nexpression. It seems to be part of a general malaise of society--the inability to<br />\nuse the language.\"<br />\n<br />\nDr. Alfred Chandler, Chairman of History: \"During the first semester (next year) different<br />\napproaches to history will be studied. The big changes will occur in the spring.\" photo by hoffmann<br />\n<br />\nOverall, the History Department is<br />\nexceedingly popular.Dr. Chandler claims<br />\nthat more students are enrolled in his-<br />\n<br />\ntory courses than those of any other department. He would like to expand into<br />\ncourses dealing with the history of other<br />\nparts of the world in addition to the traditional European and American History<br />\ncourses, but is unable to hire any qualified instructors because of the University Administration's appointment<br />\nfreeze. \"First, we want somebody to<br />\nteach Latin American History.

Compared to<br />\nsome of the President's other long-awaited policy statements, it is a highly<br />\nlaudable document, considering the fact that he has spent so much time<br />\npreparing it; however, it leaves a great deal to be desired.<br />\nWhy, for instance, do Nixon's proposed expenditures for future combat ing of pollution actually total less than those allotted for coming fiscal<br />\nyear? This fact is markedly incompatible with his statements that the current proposal is more broadly-based and far-reaching than legislation enacted under the Johnson administration. Furthermore, there is presently a bill<br />\nin the Senate calling for expenditures of $25 billion over the next five<br />\nyears. Nixon justifies his figure of $10 billion over four years with: \"This<br />\nwill provide every community that needs it with secondary waste treaytment<br />\nin areas of special need, including communities on the Great Lakes.\" This is<br />\na far cry from every community's general needs.<br />\nWhy, too, is there no mention, in the entire document, of the complex<br />\nproblems caused by the airplane? Is there perhaps a governmental conflictof-interest in the fact that the supersonic jets now being financed by Washington will cause unacceptable amounts of air and noise pollution? Why, for<br />\nexample, should towns like Glen Burnie'spend great amounts of money and<br />\neffort for proper waste treatment if the town will be psychologically<br />\ndestroyed by Friendship Airport?<br />\nSignificantly, the President's message also lacked any mention of the<br />\nsubject of oil pollution by offshore drilling and dockside leakage, despite<br />\nthe fact that it was one of the first crises to confront his administration.<br />\nIs it possible that big business will continue to get a major say in who gets<br />\nhit by Nixon's legislation and who doesn't? After all, massive federal<br />\nintervention is quite a surprise under a Republican government.<br />\nUnquestionably, many of,the President's proposals will prove helpful and<br />\nbeneficial. It is encouraging that he has declared that $327 million will be<br />\nspent this year alone on the purchase and improvement of parks and<br />\nrecreational areas. His concern with the content and quality of automobile<br />\nfuels is surprising, as in his emphasis on the possibilities and necessity of reusing and reprocessing waste materials. Perhaps most promising is his proposal that violations be quickly and effectively brought to court and that<br />\nthe courts be allowed to fine non-compliers at the prohibitive rate of<br />\n$10,000 per day.<br />\nWith some of these progressive signs, it is to be earnestly hoped that<br />\nfuture messages will assure more powerful and well-coordinated attack on<br />\none of this country's most pressing problems. One of Nixon's statements in<br />\nparticular gives rise to speculation as to whether he really understands the<br />\ngravity of the situation: \"Water pollution has three principal sources...Some<br />\nof these are nature's own pollutions. The Missouri River was known as<br />\n'Big Muddy'long before towns and industries were built on its banks.\"<br />\n<br />\n0n the S. C.<br />\nBy STUART SEIDEL<br />\nThe Guess administration began the<br />\nyear with a bang as Manuel Rodreguez<br />\nand Bill Betcher introduced a monumental resolution challenging the entire<br />\nstructure of the academic framework of<br />\nHopkins with the Johns Hopkins University Student Council Visiting Lectureship Chair. Since the meeting at which<br />\nthe proposal was adopted the Council has<br />\nsuccessfully avoided taking any further<br />\naction on the measure.<br />\nThe pace was also set from the start<br />\nby V-P Jim Stewart who left the undergraduate calendar at home before returning to Baltimore for the school year,thus<br />\ncausing a two month delay in publication<br />\nof the calendar. Jim then took steps to<br />\nassure that he would escape contributint,<br />\nanything to the SC this year by not coming<br />\nto meetings.<br />\nClose to the outset Prexy Guess and<br />\nSecretary Walters got into a big power<br />\nthing where they felt compelled to devote more time to putting down one<br />\nanother than to getting anything accomplished. Big John took to claiming how<br />\namazed he was,and still is, at how Lauren<br />\nwas trying to do everything independently<br />\nof the Council.<br />\n<br />\nPoor Lauren<br />\nMeanwhile Lauren was pulling people<br />\nover to the side to explain how he was<br />\nunhappy with John's lack of initiative in<br />\ngetting to members of the administration,<br />\nand then refering to his recent conference<br />\nwith high-ranking-administrator \"Bill\".<br />\nGuess picked up the habit of announcing<br />\nthat he was planning new programs as he<br />\nfelt the effectiveness of the SC ebbing (if<br />\nit ever existed). Then he started to pick<br />\non poor Lauren in public! Almost every<br />\ntime something happened in a meeting<br />\nthat set things haywire Johnnywould turn<br />\nto the recorder and snidely say, \"If<br />\neverything is all right with you then we'll<br />\ngo ahead\".<br />\nThe SC has progressed into the greatest living example for the need of a working Homewood-wide system of governance by regressing into the least effectual body on campus. Only once have they<br />\naccomplished anything of great value and<br />\nthat came only on the groundwork of the<br />\nmoratorium committee.<br />\nThe Council picked up the lagging antiwar group, got it going, and summarily<br />\nwas very successful in making the Oc-<br />\n<br />\nRichard B.

Then our<br />\nboys in the SC took prompt action to avoid<br />\nany further successes by not doing anything else last semester.<br />\nThey started this semester off by cancelling their meeting for the first Monday<br />\nnight of the term, holding a discussion on<br />\nthe second Monday without a quorum,and<br />\nthen \"suspending\" two members on the<br />\nthird in order to be able to conduct business. After \"suspending\" the two they<br />\npicked up the topic of discipline since<br />\nsomebody on the SC had heard it mentioned in Levering one day. Then the<br />\nCouncil decided to come out in support of<br />\nthe Conduct Code prepared by the Committee on Student Affairs just two weeks<br />\nafter President Gordon had shot it to hell.<br />\nActually the fellas have gotten started<br />\non a perty good petitionthat had been initiated by some people on the SA,but they<br />\nhave to be given a chance since they have<br />\na good reputation for picking up on things<br />\nand helping to put impetus behind them.<br />\nNot that the discipline petition should<br />\nneed much help with all the aid Dr.Gordon has given it.<br />\n<br />\nPoor John<br />\nThe encore of the SC's latest meeting<br />\nwas the main event as Guess broke into a<br />\ndiatribe advocating that the Council have<br />\nfaith it itself and get something done this<br />\nsemester.

The President came<br />\nto the Committee without any prior commitment as to the action which he<br />\nwould take during or after the meeting. In the course of a long discussion,<br />\nagreement was reached on a number of<br />\npoints. On at least four major items,<br />\nwhich included the composition of the<br />\nReview Board and the matter of expulsion versus suspension there was, however, an openly expressed divergence of<br />\nopinion which was not resolved. The<br />\nPresident, like the Committee agreed<br />\nto consider the matter further, but at<br />\nno time did he state or imply that he<br />\nwould necessarily accept any position<br />\nwhich the Committee might ultimately<br />\ntake on these matters.<br />\n<br />\nSubsequently, the Committee discussed the meeting with Dr. Gordon and decided to make certain compromises,<br />\nmost notably one affecting the composition of the Review Board. The motives<br />\nwere two-fold. Firstly, the Committee<br />\nwished to increase the chances of Dr.<br />\nGordon revising his own stand. Secondly, if he did not do so, it wished<br />\nto be in the best possible position to<br />\nconvince all segments of the university community of the reasonableness<br />\nand good sense of its conclusions.<br />\nAfter making what it regarded as the<br />\nmaximum possible concession to the<br />\nPresident's point of view, the Committee instructed me to let him know privately that, while it would be prepared<br />\nto discuss non-controversial improvements, matters of drafting, and the like,<br />\nit would not be prepared to make any<br />\nfurther changes as regards the matters<br />\nof substance on which there had been<br />\ndisagreement. The Committee, having<br />\nstruggled long and hard to reconcile the<br />\ndivergent points of view of its own<br />\nmembers and their constituencies, did<br />\nnot wish to move step by step toward<br />\na position which would make it impossible for it to remain united behind its<br />\n(continued on page 7)<br />\n<br />\n\f\"<br />\n<br />\nNEWS \u2014 LETTER<br />\n<br />\nFeb. 13, 1970<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\n(continued from page 6)<br />\nown proposals. If disagreement remained, the Committee wished its own position on matters of substance to be made<br />\npublic as it stood.<br />\nI informed the President of my instructions from the Committee and in<br />\nthe light of this information he came<br />\nto the conclusion that a further meeting would not be useful.<br />\nI apologize for taking up further space<br />\nin your columns with the Committee's<br />\naffairs, but I feel it to be important<br />\nthat the record should be made clear<br />\nso that the process of rational dialogue in which the Committee believes<br />\nmay proceed upon a basis of fact.<br />\nYours faithfully,<br />\n<br />\nJohn White<br />\n<br />\nFRATS DEFENDED<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing this letter in response<br />\nto your editorial entitled \"Only Faking<br />\nIt\". I have been particuarly disturbed<br />\nby the last two articles concerning fraternities which the News-Letter has<br />\npublished. They reveal both a lack of<br />\nunderstanding and a conscious attempt<br />\nto present a distorted image of the<br />\nfraternities.<br />\nFew people will seriously entertain<br />\nthe notion that fraternities are essential to make it socially at Hopkins. However, the availability of transportation<br />\nand knowing several close friends with<br />\ncontacts at girls' schools does make it<br />\neasier.<br />\nMy biggest gripe with the NewsLetter is the article which was written before the start of rush. A few<br />\nnights before that issue came out, some<br />\nof us were sitting around watching a<br />\nmovie and discussing what we had done<br />\nover the break. As luck would have it,<br />\njust when the movie got really interesting, the 'house phone rang. You can<br />\nimagine how overjoyed I was when I<br />\ndiscovered it was a News-Letter reMy thoughts were \"Oh Boy,<br />\nporter.<br />\nit's time for the News Letter's annual<br />\npre-rush antifraternity campaign.\" I<br />\nwas deeply involved in the movie and<br />\ndidn't especially feel like wasting time<br />\ntalking to him. When he asked if the<br />\nhouse president was in, I replied no.<br />\nHe was so intent and persistent about<br />\ngetting the facts about fraternities, however, I could not get rid of him.<br />\nWhen asked why I joined, I responded<br />\nby telling him that through my affiliation with the wrestling team, I had<br />\ngotten to like and respect a lot of the<br />\nmembers of this house. I explained<br />\n<br />\nthat I thought it was good having a lot<br />\nof friends around. I also mentioned<br />\nthat I believed that if I were just living in an apartment I would be isolated<br />\nfrom most of the Hopkins community.<br />\nI incidentally remarked that isolation<br />\nis the easy way out and that trying to<br />\nlive with other people is much more<br />\ndifficult, but rewarding and much more<br />\neducational. Besides, living in a fraternity gave me the advantage of being<br />\nclose to campus, and having all my<br />\nmeals prepared for me. Then I went<br />\nback to the movie and was fully confident that nothing of what I said would<br />\nbe printed in an article. Consequently<br />\nyour depicting fraternities as havens<br />\nfor orgiastic revelry was exactly what<br />\nI expected.<br />\nI do not wish to imply that there<br />\nwasn't some truth contained in your<br />\nbe the first to admit that<br />\narticle.<br />\nthere was. Yet what you probably don't<br />\nrealize is that most fraternity men are<br />\njust as critical of the phoniness of rush<br />\nas you are.<br />\nWhat I object to most is the conscious bias of your articles. Last<br />\nFriday when one of the members of<br />\nyour distinguished editorial staff did<br />\ncome to our \"orgiastic revelry\" he<br />\nhad to be evicted for smoking dope in<br />\nI am making a sincere<br />\nthe house.<br />\nplea for you to be more objective in<br />\nyour reporting, because when you engage in such conscious distortions and<br />\npresent them under the pretense of<br />\nnews, you are the ones who are only<br />\nfaking it.<br />\nSincerely<br />\n<br />\nBill LaCorte<br />\nPresident, Phi Gam<br />\n<br />\n\"PUERILE IMITATIONTo the Editors;<br />\nIt is too bad that the News-Letter<br />\nchooses to be a puerile imitation of<br />\nthe establishment press, rushing into<br />\nprint with whatever garbled version of<br />\n\"news\" it happens to have. Aside<br />\nfrom the fact that the New University<br />\nConference excluded members of PL/<br />\nWSA, the story on the NUC National<br />\nCommittee meeting contains little else<br />\naccurate. If your reporter was bodily<br />\nthere, as you say, for \"most of the<br />\nproceedings,\" his head was clearly else w here.<br />\nFor example, panelist Robert Klawitter comes out as Paul Clauter; Bob<br />\nRoss' paper on the new working class<br />\ngets reduced to a couple of miscellaenous and irrelevant comments; the<br />\npanel itself is called vaguely \"Class<br />\n<br />\nstruggle and revolution,\" whereas its<br />\nsubject (and title), laid out in the agenda and freely available to all, was on<br />\nthe class nature of the movement. Likewise, your reporter says that Saturday<br />\nevening was devoted to an unresolved<br />\ndiscussion of Staughton Lynd's proposal<br />\nfor concentrating anti-war work this<br />\nspring on corporations. In fact, the<br />\nproposal was discussed in plenary and<br />\nworkshops Sunday morning and approved there; most of Saturday evening<br />\nwas devoted to extended discussion of<br />\nthe decision to exclude PL/WSA, and it<br />\ninvolved very full and frank criticism<br />\nand explanation of that decision and of<br />\nthe events leading up to it.<br />\nOne could go on . \u2022 . and on. The<br />\npoint is not, however, the multitudinous inaccuracies of the story, but its<br />\nOne learns from it that<br />\nemptiness.<br />\nNUC excluded PL/WSA and talked about some other things--Lord knows<br />\nwhat or why. What I offered the NewsLetter was a detailed account of the<br />\nmeeting, the same one we shall be sending to our own members. That could<br />\nhave been put together with the few<br />\nthings your reporter did find out, perhaps with further interviews and whatever else you would, to make a useful<br />\nand informative story for your read-<br />\n<br />\ners. As it is, they are presented with<br />\na News-American hash whose content<br />\nIs dictated by deadlines and a panting<br />\ndesire to make a splash instead of by<br />\na commitment to accuracy or to the<br />\nkind of intelligent reporting one has<br />\noften found in the News-Letter this<br />\nlast year.<br />\nYours truly,<br />\n<br />\nPaul Lau ter<br />\n<br />\nTHANKS, GOD<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nHaving disassociated myself privately with your exceedingly high quality<br />\npublication, the Johns Hopkins University News-Letter, I desire to hereby<br />\nmake public the fact that, although my<br />\nname has appeared in the masthead of<br />\nyour publication for the past two issues,<br />\nI have had nothing whatever to do with<br />\nthe writing, proofreading, editing, typing, layout, final publication, or general overall quality of said issues;<br />\nfurthermore, considering the statement<br />\nmumbled by Features Editor John D.<br />\nHollis to the effect that the work I had<br />\nsubmitted was not \"of the same quality<br />\nas the News-Letter usually is,\" I may<br />\nonly say, \"Thank God!\"<br />\n<br />\nBruce L. Sager, '73<br />\n<br />\n\"Various Things\"<br />\nFamiliar But New<br />\nBy DAVID BOSTED<br />\nSenior Joel Ziskin has put together,<br />\nunder the auspices of the Office of<br />\nSpecial Events, a modest exposition of<br />\nhis considerable creative talent. On<br />\ndisplay on the quadrangle level of the<br />\nEisenhower Library through February<br />\n14 is \"Various Things\", an exhibition<br />\nof some forty photographs, paintings,<br />\nconstructions and graphic works. Included in the exhibition are two collage-like workS by his wife, Anna.<br />\nThe subjects of the photographs are<br />\nfamiliar, but almost unfailingly Ziskin<br />\nhas focused upon something newly interesting, some exclamation point in<br />\nthe run-on sentence of our daily lives.<br />\nOf the 31 photographs, no less than<br />\nfifteen (by my count) are absolutely<br />\nfirst-rate.<br />\nFor instance:<br />\n--an old woman (old people are splen-<br />\n<br />\ndid subjects!) in a street market; photograph closely cropped for effect; use<br />\nof archaic and powerful full-face photography; \"fresh fruit\" and \"new crop\"<br />\nsigns in juxtaposition to stale vegetables and an aging woman.<br />\n--baby in a buggy, snow landscape;<br />\nperfect control over tonal quality; effective compositional scheme.<br />\n--laborer strains to stir hot, bubbling<br />\ntar; the photographer's eye leans obliquely into the tar, and texture, composition, all become dramatically ordered.<br />\n<br />\nNo Solarizing<br />\nZiskin's work is the natural world.<br />\nSome of the angles are surprising (the<br />\ngirl holding a doll is wonderful), and<br />\nthere is some lens distortion (is the<br />\ndistortion of the crowd-in-a-spaciouspark photograph simply by chance?)<br />\n(continued on page 8)<br />\n<br />\nHE<br />\nMOVES HIS<br />\n<br />\nHE<br />\n<br />\nARMS UP P DOWN!<br />\n<br />\nKS!<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nLI<br />\n<br />\n.c<br />\n<br />\nHE<br />\nCHANGES<br />\n<br />\nEXPRES IONS!<br />\n<br />\nPR<br />\n<br />\nput<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nYOU'D A1440611 MINK NEI REAL<br />\n\u2022(f3A-cre-RY oeuRATEp)<br />\n<br />\nOIL<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 8<br />\n<br />\nNEWS \u2014 LETTER<br />\n<br />\nFeb. 13, 191.<br />\n<br />\nfeatures.mi<br />\nThings Change at Special Events<br />\n(continued from page 7)<br />\nbut as a rule the artist has avoided<br />\nthe trumpe d'oeil. Nothing is solarized, superimposed, or double-exposed.<br />\nJoel looks at the natural world, and<br />\nwe are surprised.<br />\nOn a technical level, the exhibition<br />\nis quite accomplished. Where are the<br />\nflaws that one comes to expect in nonprofessional exhibitions? You have to<br />\nlook close. A couple of the photographs<br />\nhave spots which derive from the developing process, and here and there a<br />\nprinting flaw has gone uncorrected-but the overall impression is one of<br />\ndelight at the quality of the prints.<br />\nThe mounting shows the photographs<br />\nto good advantage. (Here a minor complaint. Several otherwise excellent photographs--for instance, the corn crib in<br />\nthe Ray's Farm series--are marred by<br />\nsloppy mounting, which is inevitably<br />\ndistracting.)<br />\nThe artist's control over the medium<br />\n<br />\nis apparent in the excellence of, to cite<br />\na few examples, the photographs of the<br />\nrural negro boy cartin' a dead turkey,of<br />\nthe nude in an unlighted room, and of<br />\nthe Sawyers with a leaping cat.<br />\n<br />\nTimes They Have A-Changed<br />\n(Things have changed at the Office<br />\nTwo years ago,<br />\nof Special Events.<br />\n.when I was working to organize the<br />\nfirst ZBT photography show, I was<br />\ntold<br />\nthat under<br />\nno circumstances<br />\ncould \"undressed female figures\" appear in the exhibit.)<br />\nA word on composition. Zisldn's<br />\npictures stand or fall on the strength<br />\nof the composition. Ineffective composition, as in the low vantage-point<br />\nhorse photograph or in the two-fellowsin-a-cafe photograph, places his pictures beyond salvation. Viewers would<br />\ndo well to study Ziskin's successful<br />\ncompositional schemes, and to ask them-<br />\n<br />\nselves why they are so clearly successful.<br />\nConspicuous by its absence is the lack<br />\nof information about the photographs.<br />\nThe viewer wonders, was the camera<br />\nhand-held or mounted upon a tripod?<br />\nWhat was the shutter-speed?<br />\nWhat<br />\nwas the aperture opening? What type<br />\nof camera was employed? What lens<br />\nwas used for the interesting picture<br />\nof the party? The lighting is usually<br />\nnatural, but the time of day is not always clear. When the lighting is not<br />\nnatural, what is it? A good guess is<br />\nthat the film is in all cases Tri-x,<br />\nbut without the artist's. acknowledgement it is impossible to be certain.<br />\n<br />\ndon't fit very well into the decaying<br />\nrural scene. (Better in the city?) The<br />\ncity doesn't look so good either. The<br />\ncity looks pretty cold, alien and hostile (Tri-x has a way of making inorganic materials look icy and hard).<br />\nEven the portraiture has a static quality about it. Figures are posed, very<br />\nposed. Now, high contrast paper and<br />\nTri-x film can produce heat and warmth (for instance, Sam Haskins' African<br />\nImage); Ziskin consistent ability to produce frozen images is remarkable, and<br />\nis perhaps a theme in itself.<br />\nThe virtues of the Ziskin exhibition,<br />\nwhich are many, unfortunately do not<br />\ninclude consistency. The photographY<br />\nfar outshines the unchallenging \"other'<br />\nof the exhibition, which tends toward<br />\nkitsch. When you're at the exhibition,<br />\nand you come to a bad work, just walk<br />\non by...save your time for the reallY<br />\ngood ones.<br />\n<br />\n\"Various Things\" is not a rigorous<br />\nexhibition. But despite the loose organization, are there any themes? Difficult to say.

It<br />\nwas the hucklers eleventh victory in as many outings and set the<br />\nstage for a title match against the Muncie Indiana Pelicans who<br />\nclenched the Sycamore Springs League title last week.<br />\nBoth teams played exceedingly well despite a dense fog enveloping the Hoboken course, nicknamed \"Asthma Acres\" by visiting<br />\nsquads.<br />\nThe Zephyrs raced to an early<br />\nlead on square one with Dudley<br />\nHammock and Channing Jarbeaver<br />\ndisplaying great finesse with a wide<br />\nvariety of whirlawang shots and<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER SPORTS<br />\nhurryaxe placements. Through the<br />\nSPECIAL IN\u2014DEPTH<br />\nFEATURE REPORT.<br />\nforth square Hoboken extended their<br />\nlead to 79-66 1/4 and a full two<br />\nminutes in time.<br />\nThe fifth square, however, belonged to Hopkins with Milo Dork<br />\nleading the way. Dork's huckle seemed hopelessly wedged against<br />\nthe dike that holds the water hazard in the middle of the looped<br />\ngrove of twiney trees that makes the fifth square such a difficult<br />\nover-and-under shot. With incredible nonchalance, Dork addressed his huckle and converted a perfect triple reverse that brought<br />\n\"Oohs\" and \"Ahs\" from the partisan Hoboken gallery. At that<br />\npoint Hopkins overtook the lead by a 92 3/4 - 811/4 margin.<br />\nMomentum was in the Blue Jays favor from that point despite the<br />\nloss of Buzz Condom, the Jays star loose-end, who developed a<br />\npesky allergy in the mens rool of the seventh square and was carried<br />\nfrom the course by stretcher.<br />\n<br />\nBobble Bursts<br />\nAfter 13 rather uneventful minutes in the eighth square,<br />\ntempers<br />\nflaired briefly over a controversial hurryaxe by E.<br />\n\"Digits\" Wurlitzer of the Hopkins secondary. Play resumed, however,<br />\nafter an<br />\nofficial ruling in Wurlitzer's favor, though not until<br />\nWurlitzer and<br />\nDelwood Bobble were placed in \"the Box\" for<br />\nsportsmanship unbecoming a huckler\".<br />\nThe ninth and final square saw Hopkins with a comfortab<br />\nle 147 1/4<br />\n- 133 3/4 lead, and the outcome seemed obvious. But<br />\nthe \"neversay-die\" Hoboken tertiary squad, inspired by the<br />\nbrilliant playmaking of Delwood Bobble, fresh from \"the Box\", very<br />\nnearly turned<br />\nthe tables. With only 5 seconds remaining, Bobble<br />\nconverted a<br />\nshakey but colorful left-handed snide, and victory<br />\nwas denied for<br />\nthe Zephyrs due to the loss of precious form<br />\npoints.<br />\n<br />\nWatch Out, Pelicans<br />\nIn the end, it was Hopkins 147, Hoboken 142 1/4 in one<br />\nof the<br />\nmost unusually close and exciting matches this writer<br />\nhas seen<br />\nin the past decade.<br />\nDuring the post-match festivities, Mayo DeBakey,<br />\nthe Hopkins<br />\nHuckling coach said that although he was concerned<br />\nover Condoms<br />\nloss, he was sure that the Blue Jays would be \"psyched<br />\nup\" for<br />\nthe title match against the Muncie Pelicans. Said<br />\nDeBakey: \"We've<br />\nwaited a long time for this match, and if the Pelicans<br />\nthink that just<br />\nbecause we've lost our Condom we won't be at full<br />\nstrength, well they've got another thing coming.\"<br />\n<br />\nW. Maryland Pins Blue Jay Grapplers<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nLast Wednesday night, Hopkins' varsity wrestlers dropped a match to the tough Western Maryland Team by the score of 33-5. This now makes<br />\nHopkins' record 3-5 on the season, and 2-2 in<br />\nthe conference.<br />\nDespite the scoring, all the Hopkins' wrestlers fought very well, often losing by two points<br />\nor less.<br />\nDoug Seward, at 126 for Hopkins,<br />\nwrestled Ken Myers to a 4-3 decision loss, setting the pace for the remainder of the evening.<br />\nJeff Turshen was pinned by an excellent wrestler, Gary Sholl, but Betta and Hanemann lost by<br />\nscores of 2-1 and 2-2 decision. (Betta's loss<br />\ncame on one of the referee's most controversial<br />\nstalling calls-in the last four seconds). Betta<br />\nand Hanemann lost to Captain Terry Conover<br />\nand William Blake, a much improved wrestler, which should magnify the strength of their<br />\n<br />\nperformances.<br />\nIn other matches, Fred Ryland lost to TOM<br />\nBarnes by a score of 5-2, Bob Sanborn and Vernon Myers kept from getting pinned by Leverton and Wayne Gibson great shows of endurance,<br />\nwhile Marshall Capp was pinned by the \"hometown favorite\", Leon Cronce, at heavyweight'<br />\n<br />\nHigh Point<br />\nThe high point of the evening for Hopkins'<br />\nfans came when Nick Pratt, wrestling at 190,<br />\npinned the Terrors' Kiemle in the third period,<br />\nthus saving the match from a complete loss.<br />\nThe matches were close enough at times to<br />\nmake the ref's calls very controversial and argumentative. But, in conclusion, it was a hard<br />\nfought match by Hopkins against a superior Western Maryland team.<br />\nHopkins' next match will be tomorrow at 3:30<br />\np.m. against Ursinus at the Athletic Center.<br />\n<br />\nFrosh Lack Depth, Not Desire<br />\nIncluded in Hal Grosh's coaching itinerary along<br />\nwith football and lacrosse is freshmen wrestling.<br />\nCoach Grosh is a former wrestler who previously<br />\ncoached a Baltimore high school and the University<br />\nof Delaware's frosh matmen.<br />\nOne general problem related to the nature of<br />\nthe sport itself is that it is highly individualistic<br />\nand physically demanding, which means personal<br />\nsacrifice. Because of these factors, Coach Grosh<br />\nstates, \"I would never encourage a kid to come<br />\nout for wrestling if he were undecided.\"<br />\nTwo very essential qualities of a goodwrestler<br />\nare attitude and desire. The coach feels that the<br />\nfew members of this year's frosh squad possess<br />\nthese characteristics. Coach Grosh cites two<br />\ngrapplers on his team as outstanding performers;<br />\nthey are Dave Olp and John Ligums. John, who<br />\nis better known as \"Tiny\" and wrestles in the<br />\nunlimited division, tips the scales at 235. \"Tiny\"<br />\nis very strong, and often just literally overpowers<br />\n<br />\nhis opponents\u2014or, perhaps more applicable, victims, for he is yet undefeated this season and<br />\nhas four straight pins, all in the first period.<br />\nAn obstacle every wrestler has to face is \"making weight\": this is where the sport starts to differ<br />\ndrastically from all others. Although the team may<br />\ngo through a practice with running, situation<br />\nwrestling and scrimmage matches, the individual<br />\nwrestler must make a concerted physical and psychological effort to stay at fighting weight. \"This<br />\nmeans coming from practice and not eating a nice,<br />\nbig meal and walking past a water fountain that<br />\nstands eight feet tall and looks like an oasis,<br />\nbecause the bulk of the weight loss is water.\"<br />\nOne specific problem that Coach Grosh faces<br />\nis the lack of personnel. ,\"We've had to forfeit,<br />\nat times, five matches of the ten weight classes,<br />\nsimply because we didn't have anyone.\"<br />\n<br />\n/rte.<br />\nI<br />\n1111<br />\nAlthough Buzz Condom will mks the title tilt with the Pelicans, All-America<br />\nn candidate Milo Dork's offensive style.<br />\ncoupled with \"Digits\" Wurlitzer's blood-and-guts desire (as displayed<br />\nin his grapple with Bobble above), give Hopkins<br />\na powerful one-two punch against the highly touted Sycamore Spring Champs..<br />\n<br />\nMarine Corps Officer selection team will be on camPos<br />\nthe 25th and 26th of February to discuss their officer<br />\nprograms.<br />\n<br />\n'\"WE GIVE<br />\n<br />\nDISCOUNTS<br />\nON HI-Fl<br />\n<br />\nCOMPONENTS<br />\nSONY AR DYNA PIONEER<br />\nGARRARD DUAL BOZAK<br />\nWHARFEDALE KOSS SHUO<br />\nYOUR<br />\n<br />\nSAMPLE STORE<br />\n3031 Oreenmount Ave.<br />\nin Waverly<br />\n<br />\nGARRARD<br />\n<br />\nLIST<br />\n<br />\nCOST<br />\n<br />\nSL95-B<br />\nSL72-B<br />\nSL55-B<br />\nSL40-B<br />\n<br />\n129.50<br />\n89.50<br />\n59.50<br />\n44.50<br />\n<br />\n89.89<br />\n65.89<br />\n43.89<br />\n33.89<br />\n<br />\nHI-FIDELITY \u2022<br />\nCENTER<br />\nThe House of Low Low Prices<br />\n317W.

I did that in<br />\nthe case of the Committee on Student<br />\nAffairs.\"<br />\nCalling last Friday's News-Letter editorial \"simply wrong,\" Gordon pointed<br />\nout that he \"accepted a significant portion of their proposals, indeed, really<br />\nused their draft as the base of this<br />\nnew draft.\"<br /><br />\n\"No\"<br />\nWhen asked if he would consider a<br />\npetition which simply asked that his<br />\nProposal be changed to be identical to<br />\nthat submitted by the SAC, Gordon stated \"unless they produce new reasons,<br />\nwhich were more persuasive than the<br />\nold reasons, no.\"<br />\nHe went on to say that \"this is an<br />\nhypothesis which seems to me really<br />\nrather unlikely.\" Gordon further stated that he \"would be impressed\" if a<br />\nsignificant number of students and faculty supported the reasoning of the<br />\nSAC.<br />\nGordon said that the various reactions<br />\nto his proposal \"seem to be trying to<br />\ncreate confrontations, sharp confrontations...\" He continued stating that he<br />\n\"tried to deal with the issues, as objectively as possible, and I hope that<br /><br />\nthe News-Letter would learn to do the<br />\nsame.''<br /><br />\n\"Distinguished Journal\"<br />\nGordon pointed out that if he \"were<br />\nreally as arbitrary as your distinguished<br />\n,ournal suggests, I could just have drafted something myself and put it out... It<br />\nseems to me that I have been leaning<br />\nover rather strenously to avoid being<br />\narbitrary... The most arbitrary thing<br />\nwould be to just keep all the power,<br />\nwhich I have at the present time and<br />\nexercise it arbitrarily. I don't believe<br />\nin the arbitrary use of power and I must<br />\nsay that it would be nice if this point<br />\nwere recognized.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the possibility of<br />\ndelaying a final decision on this matter<br />\nuntil after the question of governance<br />\nhas been decided, Gordon mentioned that<br />\nthe new governing body could amend the<br />\ncode and that \"on the whole, we would<br />\nbe better off to have a policy formally<br />\nin effect.\"<br />\n\"A<br /><br />\nKey Point\"<br /><br />\nIn referring to the relationship between his proposal and that of the SAC,<br />\nGordon stated \"The differences are<br />\nnot so large, this is perhaps a key<br />\npoint. I find it a little difficult to see<br />\nthat any of the particular differences<br />\nhere between the SAC committee draft<br />\nand my draft as transcendental, vital<br />\nIssues.\"<br /><br />\nsence of two undergraduate students and two graduate<br />\nstudents on the Board opposite three faculty members<br />\nwould give the students a majority. \"Graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students have very diverse interests\",<br />\nsaid Cleary. They are not a unified body, he suggested, and thus would not form a majority.<br />\nOn the expulsion issue, Cleary again said that it was<br />\nthe protection of ,the students that was at stake. He<br />\nstated that the best way to protect students was to limit<br />\nthe sanctions that could be imposed by the Review<br />\nBoard.<br /><br />\nCleary indicated that if President Gordon did not<br />\nrespond to the petition, he would be prepared to use<br />\nother channels. \"I'm sure we could handle a demonstration\", he said.<br /><br />\nPresent Student Conduct Code<br />\nUnearthed from`Hiding Place'<br />\nIn Student Council Constitution<br />\nThe Gentleman's Code and Student<br />\nCouncil Constitution contain clauses<br />\nwhich cast doubt on the validity of President Gordon's publicly announced reasons for wanting a Conduct Code.<br />\nLast year Dr. Gordon charged an ad<br />\nhoc Committee on Governance with writing a Conduct Code for the University<br />\nbecause, he claimed, none existed. He<br />\nsaid his wish was to delegate some of<br />\nhis authority to other persons in the<br />\nHopkins community.<br /><br />\nSystem Governs<br />\nThe constitution, written last year by<br />\nan SC Committee chaired by Manuel<br />\nRodriguez, states that all student behavior shall be in accordance with the<br />\nGentleman's Code. The code states that<br />\n\"The Honor System governs not only<br />\nconduct in class and examination rooms<br />\nbut also those aspects of behavior among<br />\nstudents on the campus...which might in<br />\nany way compromise or undermine the<br />\npresent valued ethical concept of Hopkins men.\"<br />\nThe Honor Commission controls academic breaches of the Gentleman's Code.<br />\nOnly students are permitted to sit on<br />\nthe Commission, and its decisions are<br /><br />\nnot subject to review by any higher placed members of the University.<br />\nFor non-academic behavior, the SC<br />\nConstitution states that the Student Council is to have jurisdiction over offenders.<br />\nBehavior by any undergraduate student or<br />\nstudents is subject to investigation and<br />\ndecision by the SC, according to Article<br />\nIV, section 2.<br /><br />\nConstitution Revised<br />\nThe constitution was revised and ratified by the study body last spring. However, the individual parts affecting conduct were taken from the previous<br />\nconstitution, which had been in effect for<br />\nseveral years. The Honor System and<br />\nGentleman's Code have been in existence<br />\nsince the founding of the University.<br />\nWhen Dr. Gordon announced his decision to have a formal Conduct Code, the<br />\nSC did not inform him of the already<br />\nexisting rules of conduct. No SC offic ,rs or representatives have brought the<br />\nconstitution to light this year either.<br />\nThe SC Constitution only effects undergraduate students.

Marron received his second absence on<br />\nNovember 3 and Szoka got his on February 2.<br />\nWhether Marron and Szoka can continue as presidents<br />\nof their classes is not stated in the SC Constitution.<br />\nRegardless, they should no longer participate as members of the Council.<br />\nAs Treasurer of the SC, Globig sits on the Student<br />\nActivities Committe which decides allocations of financies to student organizations. The Activities Committee chooses the Treasurer of the Student Council in<br />\nthe spring of each year, and would, apparently, choose<br />\na replacement for Globig if he is forced off the SC due<br />\nto absences.<br />\nAt Monday's meeting Guess announced that all of<br />\nGlobig's unexcused absences should be changed to excused. At that time he refused to explain why, but the<br />\nnext day said that because Globig does so much work<br />\nfor the Activities Committee, he could be \"excused for<br />\nmeetings of the Council he has missed.\" He did not<br />\nexplain why he had not, previously excused Globig for<br />\nabsences.<br /><br />\nThere is no prescribed means by which the class<br />\npresidents can be replaced if they are put off the SC,<br />\nthus their positions would remain vacant.<br />\nNone of the persons who have incurred two or more<br />\nabsences have made any gestures indicating they intend<br />\nto resign from the SC.

During the<br />\nfirst semester different approaches to<br />\nhistory will be studied.<br />\nDepartment<br />\nmembers will discuss great books with<br />\nthe students. The big change occurs in the<br />\nspring, when the class breaks up into<br />\ntutorials, with no more than two students<br />\nworking with a professor.\"<br />\nDr. David Cohen, who teaches African<br />\nHistory and who taught the VictorianImperialism course said that the change<br />\nin the style of the seminars was brought<br />\nabout by two factors. \"The number of<br />\nhistory majors has increased to twenty,<br />\nthus making the seminars unwiedly. Also<br />\nthere is an increasing maturity of students. They are coming out of much<br />\nstronger<br />\nhigh school history backgrounds.\"<br /><br />\nBad Riting<br />\nAnother problem plaguing the department is the inferior quality of writing<br />\nexhibited by the students. Because of<br />\nthis, the tutorials will place a much<br />\ngreater emphases on intensive writing<br />\nand criticism. \"There is a terrible problem in undergraduate writing,\" said<br />\nChandler. \"The high schools don't teach<br />\nhow to structure a paper. It's surprising how many papers don't have a beginning or end.\"<br />\nCohen observed, \"Students have trouble setting thoughts down on paper. I'm<br />\nnot the only one in the department who<br />\nhas failed students for incompetence in<br />\nexpression.

Compared to<br />\nsome of the President's other long-awaited policy statements, it is a highly<br />\nlaudable document, considering the fact that he has spent so much time<br />\npreparing it; however, it leaves a great deal to be desired.<br />\nWhy, for instance, do Nixon's proposed expenditures for future combat ing of pollution actually total less than those allotted for coming fiscal<br />\nyear? This fact is markedly incompatible with his statements that the current proposal is more broadly-based and far-reaching than legislation enacted under the Johnson administration. Furthermore, there is presently a bill<br />\nin the Senate calling for expenditures of $25 billion over the next five<br />\nyears. Nixon justifies his figure of $10 billion over four years with: \"This<br />\nwill provide every community that needs it with secondary waste treaytment<br />\nin areas of special need, including communities on the Great Lakes.\" This is<br />\na far cry from every community's general needs.<br />\nWhy, too, is there no mention, in the entire document, of the complex<br />\nproblems caused by the airplane? Is there perhaps a governmental conflictof-interest in the fact that the supersonic jets now being financed by Washington will cause unacceptable amounts of air and noise pollution? Why, for<br />\nexample, should towns like Glen Burnie'spend great amounts of money and<br />\neffort for proper waste treatment if the town will be psychologically<br />\ndestroyed by Friendship Airport?<br />\nSignificantly, the President's message also lacked any mention of the<br />\nsubject of oil pollution by offshore drilling and dockside leakage, despite<br />\nthe fact that it was one of the first crises to confront his administration.<br />\nIs it possible that big business will continue to get a major say in who gets<br />\nhit by Nixon's legislation and who doesn't? After all, massive federal<br />\nintervention is quite a surprise under a Republican government.<br />\nUnquestionably, many of,the President's proposals will prove helpful and<br />\nbeneficial. It is encouraging that he has declared that $327 million will be<br />\nspent this year alone on the purchase and improvement of parks and<br />\nrecreational areas. His concern with the content and quality of automobile<br />\nfuels is surprising, as in his emphasis on the possibilities and necessity of reusing and reprocessing waste materials. Perhaps most promising is his proposal that violations be quickly and effectively brought to court and that<br />\nthe courts be allowed to fine non-compliers at the prohibitive rate of<br />\n$10,000 per day.<br />\nWith some of these progressive signs, it is to be earnestly hoped that<br />\nfuture messages will assure more powerful and well-coordinated attack on<br />\none of this country's most pressing problems. One of Nixon's statements in<br />\nparticular gives rise to speculation as to whether he really understands the<br />\ngravity of the situation: \"Water pollution has three principal sources...Some<br />\nof these are nature's own pollutions. The Missouri River was known as<br />\n'Big Muddy'long before towns and industries were built on its banks.\"<br /><br />\n0n the S. C.<br />\nBy STUART SEIDEL<br />\nThe Guess administration began the<br />\nyear with a bang as Manuel Rodreguez<br />\nand Bill Betcher introduced a monumental resolution challenging the entire<br />\nstructure of the academic framework of<br />\nHopkins with the Johns Hopkins University Student Council Visiting Lectureship Chair. Since the meeting at which<br />\nthe proposal was adopted the Council has<br />\nsuccessfully avoided taking any further<br />\naction on the measure.<br />\nThe pace was also set from the start<br />\nby V-P Jim Stewart who left the undergraduate calendar at home before returning to Baltimore for the school year,thus<br />\ncausing a two month delay in publication<br />\nof the calendar. Jim then took steps to<br />\nassure that he would escape contributint,<br />\nanything to the SC this year by not coming<br />\nto meetings.<br />\nClose to the outset Prexy Guess and<br />\nSecretary Walters got into a big power<br />\nthing where they felt compelled to devote more time to putting down one<br />\nanother than to getting anything accomplished. Big John took to claiming how<br />\namazed he was,and still is, at how Lauren<br />\nwas trying to do everything independently<br />\nof the Council.<br /><br />\nPoor Lauren<br />\nMeanwhile Lauren was pulling people<br />\nover to the side to explain how he was<br />\nunhappy with John's lack of initiative in<br />\ngetting to members of the administration,<br />\nand then refering to his recent conference<br />\nwith high-ranking-administrator \"Bill\".<br />\nGuess picked up the habit of announcing<br />\nthat he was planning new programs as he<br />\nfelt the effectiveness of the SC ebbing (if<br />\nit ever existed). Then he started to pick<br />\non poor Lauren in public! Almost every<br />\ntime something happened in a meeting<br />\nthat set things haywire Johnnywould turn<br />\nto the recorder and snidely say, \"If<br />\neverything is all right with you then we'll<br />\ngo ahead\".<br />\nThe SC has progressed into the greatest living example for the need of a working Homewood-wide system of governance by regressing into the least effectual body on campus. Only once have they<br />\naccomplished anything of great value and<br />\nthat came only on the groundwork of the<br />\nmoratorium committee.<br />\nThe Council picked up the lagging antiwar group, got it going, and summarily<br />\nwas very successful in making the Oc-<br /><br />\nRichard B.

Then our<br />\nboys in the SC took prompt action to avoid<br />\nany further successes by not doing anything else last semester.<br />\nThey started this semester off by cancelling their meeting for the first Monday<br />\nnight of the term, holding a discussion on<br />\nthe second Monday without a quorum,and<br />\nthen \"suspending\" two members on the<br />\nthird in order to be able to conduct business. After \"suspending\" the two they<br />\npicked up the topic of discipline since<br />\nsomebody on the SC had heard it mentioned in Levering one day. Then the<br />\nCouncil decided to come out in support of<br />\nthe Conduct Code prepared by the Committee on Student Affairs just two weeks<br />\nafter President Gordon had shot it to hell.<br />\nActually the fellas have gotten started<br />\non a perty good petitionthat had been initiated by some people on the SA,but they<br />\nhave to be given a chance since they have<br />\na good reputation for picking up on things<br />\nand helping to put impetus behind them.<br />\nNot that the discipline petition should<br />\nneed much help with all the aid Dr.Gordon has given it.<br /><br />\nPoor John<br />\nThe encore of the SC's latest meeting<br />\nwas the main event as Guess broke into a<br />\ndiatribe advocating that the Council have<br />\nfaith it itself and get something done this<br />\nsemester.

Until petty<br />\nbickering and jealousy is resolved among<br />\nboth the high-ranking members and the<br />\nregular representatives nothing will be<br />\naccomplished by the Council.

The President came<br />\nto the Committee without any prior commitment as to the action which he<br />\nwould take during or after the meeting. In the course of a long discussion,<br />\nagreement was reached on a number of<br />\npoints. On at least four major items,<br />\nwhich included the composition of the<br />\nReview Board and the matter of expulsion versus suspension there was, however, an openly expressed divergence of<br />\nopinion which was not resolved. The<br />\nPresident, like the Committee agreed<br />\nto consider the matter further, but at<br />\nno time did he state or imply that he<br />\nwould necessarily accept any position<br />\nwhich the Committee might ultimately<br />\ntake on these matters.<br /><br />\nSubsequently, the Committee discussed the meeting with Dr. Gordon and decided to make certain compromises,<br />\nmost notably one affecting the composition of the Review Board. The motives<br />\nwere two-fold. Firstly, the Committee<br />\nwished to increase the chances of Dr.<br />\nGordon revising his own stand. Secondly, if he did not do so, it wished<br />\nto be in the best possible position to<br />\nconvince all segments of the university community of the reasonableness<br />\nand good sense of its conclusions.<br />\nAfter making what it regarded as the<br />\nmaximum possible concession to the<br />\nPresident's point of view, the Committee instructed me to let him know privately that, while it would be prepared<br />\nto discuss non-controversial improvements, matters of drafting, and the like,<br />\nit would not be prepared to make any<br />\nfurther changes as regards the matters<br />\nof substance on which there had been<br />\ndisagreement. The Committee, having<br />\nstruggled long and hard to reconcile the<br />\ndivergent points of view of its own<br />\nmembers and their constituencies, did<br />\nnot wish to move step by step toward<br />\na position which would make it impossible for it to remain united behind its<br />\n(continued on page 7)<br /><br />\n\"<br /><br />\nNEWS \u2014 LETTER<br /><br />\nFeb. 13, 1970<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\n(continued from page 6)<br />\nown proposals. If disagreement remained, the Committee wished its own position on matters of substance to be made<br />\npublic as it stood.<br />\nI informed the President of my instructions from the Committee and in<br />\nthe light of this information he came<br />\nto the conclusion that a further meeting would not be useful.<br />\nI apologize for taking up further space<br />\nin your columns with the Committee's<br />\naffairs, but I feel it to be important<br />\nthat the record should be made clear<br />\nso that the process of rational dialogue in which the Committee believes<br />\nmay proceed upon a basis of fact.<br />\nYours faithfully,<br /><br />\nJohn White<br /><br />\nFRATS DEFENDED<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing this letter in response<br />\nto your editorial entitled \"Only Faking<br />\nIt\". I have been particuarly disturbed<br />\nby the last two articles concerning fraternities which the News-Letter has<br />\npublished. They reveal both a lack of<br />\nunderstanding and a conscious attempt<br />\nto present a distorted image of the<br />\nfraternities.<br />\nFew people will seriously entertain<br />\nthe notion that fraternities are essential to make it socially at Hopkins. However, the availability of transportation<br />\nand knowing several close friends with<br />\ncontacts at girls' schools does make it<br />\neasier.<br />\nMy biggest gripe with the NewsLetter is the article which was written before the start of rush. A few<br />\nnights before that issue came out, some<br />\nof us were sitting around watching a<br />\nmovie and discussing what we had done<br />\nover the break. As luck would have it,<br />\njust when the movie got really interesting, the 'house phone rang. You can<br />\nimagine how overjoyed I was when I<br />\ndiscovered it was a News-Letter reMy thoughts were \"Oh Boy,<br />\nporter.<br />\nit's time for the News Letter's annual<br />\npre-rush antifraternity campaign.\" I<br />\nwas deeply involved in the movie and<br />\ndidn't especially feel like wasting time<br />\ntalking to him. When he asked if the<br />\nhouse president was in, I replied no.<br />\nHe was so intent and persistent about<br />\ngetting the facts about fraternities, however, I could not get rid of him.<br />\nWhen asked why I joined, I responded<br />\nby telling him that through my affiliation with the wrestling team, I had<br />\ngotten to like and respect a lot of the<br />\nmembers of this house. I explained<br /><br />\nthat I thought it was good having a lot<br />\nof friends around. I also mentioned<br />\nthat I believed that if I were just living in an apartment I would be isolated<br />\nfrom most of the Hopkins community.<br />\nI incidentally remarked that isolation<br />\nis the easy way out and that trying to<br />\nlive with other people is much more<br />\ndifficult, but rewarding and much more<br />\neducational. Besides, living in a fraternity gave me the advantage of being<br />\nclose to campus, and having all my<br />\nmeals prepared for me. Then I went<br />\nback to the movie and was fully confident that nothing of what I said would<br />\nbe printed in an article. Consequently<br />\nyour depicting fraternities as havens<br />\nfor orgiastic revelry was exactly what<br />\nI expected.<br />\nI do not wish to imply that there<br />\nwasn't some truth contained in your<br />\nbe the first to admit that<br />\narticle.<br />\nthere was. Yet what you probably don't<br />\nrealize is that most fraternity men are<br />\njust as critical of the phoniness of rush<br />\nas you are.<br />\nWhat I object to most is the conscious bias of your articles. Last<br />\nFriday when one of the members of<br />\nyour distinguished editorial staff did<br />\ncome to our \"orgiastic revelry\" he<br />\nhad to be evicted for smoking dope in<br />\nI am making a sincere<br />\nthe house.<br />\nplea for you to be more objective in<br />\nyour reporting, because when you engage in such conscious distortions and<br />\npresent them under the pretense of<br />\nnews, you are the ones who are only<br />\nfaking it.<br />\nSincerely<br /><br />\nBill LaCorte<br />\nPresident, Phi Gam<br /><br />\n\"PUERILE IMITATIONTo the Editors;<br />\nIt is too bad that the News-Letter<br />\nchooses to be a puerile imitation of<br />\nthe establishment press, rushing into<br />\nprint with whatever garbled version of<br />\n\"news\" it happens to have. Aside<br />\nfrom the fact that the New University<br />\nConference excluded members of PL/<br />\nWSA, the story on the NUC National<br />\nCommittee meeting contains little else<br />\naccurate. If your reporter was bodily<br />\nthere, as you say, for \"most of the<br />\nproceedings,\" his head was clearly else w here.<br />\nFor example, panelist Robert Klawitter comes out as Paul Clauter; Bob<br />\nRoss' paper on the new working class<br />\ngets reduced to a couple of miscellaenous and irrelevant comments; the<br />\npanel itself is called vaguely \"Class<br /><br />\nstruggle and revolution,\" whereas its<br />\nsubject (and title), laid out in the agenda and freely available to all, was on<br />\nthe class nature of the movement. Likewise, your reporter says that Saturday<br />\nevening was devoted to an unresolved<br />\ndiscussion of Staughton Lynd's proposal<br />\nfor concentrating anti-war work this<br />\nspring on corporations. In fact, the<br />\nproposal was discussed in plenary and<br />\nworkshops Sunday morning and approved there; most of Saturday evening<br />\nwas devoted to extended discussion of<br />\nthe decision to exclude PL/WSA, and it<br />\ninvolved very full and frank criticism<br />\nand explanation of that decision and of<br />\nthe events leading up to it.<br />\nOne could go on . \u2022 . and on. The<br />\npoint is not, however, the multitudinous inaccuracies of the story, but its<br />\nOne learns from it that<br />\nemptiness.<br />\nNUC excluded PL/WSA and talked about some other things--Lord knows<br />\nwhat or why. What I offered the NewsLetter was a detailed account of the<br />\nmeeting, the same one we shall be sending to our own members. That could<br />\nhave been put together with the few<br />\nthings your reporter did find out, perhaps with further interviews and whatever else you would, to make a useful<br />\nand informative story for your read-<br /><br />\ners. As it is, they are presented with<br />\na News-American hash whose content<br />\nIs dictated by deadlines and a panting<br />\ndesire to make a splash instead of by<br />\na commitment to accuracy or to the<br />\nkind of intelligent reporting one has<br />\noften found in the News-Letter this<br />\nlast year.<br />\nYours truly,<br /><br />\nPaul Lau ter<br /><br />\nTHANKS, GOD<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nHaving disassociated myself privately with your exceedingly high quality<br />\npublication, the Johns Hopkins University News-Letter, I desire to hereby<br />\nmake public the fact that, although my<br />\nname has appeared in the masthead of<br />\nyour publication for the past two issues,<br />\nI have had nothing whatever to do with<br />\nthe writing, proofreading, editing, typing, layout, final publication, or general overall quality of said issues;<br />\nfurthermore, considering the statement<br />\nmumbled by Features Editor John D.<br />\nHollis to the effect that the work I had<br />\nsubmitted was not \"of the same quality<br />\nas the News-Letter usually is,\" I may<br />\nonly say, \"Thank God!\"<br /><br />\nBruce L.

On<br />\ndisplay on the quadrangle level of the<br />\nEisenhower Library through February<br />\n14 is \"Various Things\", an exhibition<br />\nof some forty photographs, paintings,<br />\nconstructions and graphic works.

Where are the<br />\nflaws that one comes to expect in nonprofessional exhibitions? You have to<br />\nlook close. A couple of the photographs<br />\nhave spots which derive from the developing process, and here and there a<br />\nprinting flaw has gone uncorrected-but the overall impression is one of<br />\ndelight at the quality of the prints.<br />\nThe mounting shows the photographs<br />\nto good advantage. (Here a minor complaint. Several otherwise excellent photographs--for instance, the corn crib in<br />\nthe Ray's Farm series--are marred by<br />\nsloppy mounting, which is inevitably<br />\ndistracting.)<br />\nThe artist's control over the medium<br /><br />\nis apparent in the excellence of, to cite<br />\na few examples, the photographs of the<br />\nrural negro boy cartin' a dead turkey,of<br />\nthe nude in an unlighted room, and of<br />\nthe Sawyers with a leaping cat.<br /><br />\nTimes They Have A-Changed<br />\n(Things have changed at the Office<br />\nTwo years ago,<br />\nof Special Events.<br />\n.when I was working to organize the<br />\nfirst ZBT photography show, I was<br />\ntold<br />\nthat under<br />\nno circumstances<br />\ncould \"undressed female figures\" appear in the exhibit.)<br />\nA word on composition. Zisldn's<br />\npictures stand or fall on the strength<br />\nof the composition. Ineffective composition, as in the low vantage-point<br />\nhorse photograph or in the two-fellowsin-a-cafe photograph, places his pictures beyond salvation. Viewers would<br />\ndo well to study Ziskin's successful<br />\ncompositional schemes, and to ask them-<br /><br />\nselves why they are so clearly successful.<br />\nConspicuous by its absence is the lack<br />\nof information about the photographs.<br />\nThe viewer wonders, was the camera<br />\nhand-held or mounted upon a tripod?<br />\nWhat was the shutter-speed?<br />\nWhat<br />\nwas the aperture opening? What type<br />\nof camera was employed? What lens<br />\nwas used for the interesting picture<br />\nof the party? The lighting is usually<br />\nnatural, but the time of day is not always clear. When the lighting is not<br />\nnatural, what is it? A good guess is<br />\nthat the film is in all cases Tri-x,<br />\nbut without the artist's. acknowledgement it is impossible to be certain.<br /><br />\ndon't fit very well into the decaying<br />\nrural scene. (Better in the city?) The<br />\ncity doesn't look so good either. The<br />\ncity looks pretty cold, alien and hostile (Tri-x has a way of making inorganic materials look icy and hard).<br />\nEven the portraiture has a static quality about it. Figures are posed, very<br />\nposed. Now, high contrast paper and<br />\nTri-x film can produce heat and warmth (for instance, Sam Haskins' African<br />\nImage); Ziskin consistent ability to produce frozen images is remarkable, and<br />\nis perhaps a theme in itself.<br />\nThe virtues of the Ziskin exhibition,<br />\nwhich are many, unfortunately do not<br />\ninclude consistency.

Mike O'Donnell won the<br />\nSO free ahead of Brian Turner and went<br />\nOnto win his regualar event,<br />\nthe 200 yard<br />\nbreaststroke, to become the only double<br />\nwinner of the day.<br />\nThe medley relay kicked off the meet<br />\nby beating the<br />\nTowson relay by almost 26<br />\nseconds. Team captain Rick Ware and<br />\nsenior Bob Fisher took first and second<br />\nin the 200 yard individual medley. Fisher<br />\nPicked up more points for the team by<br />\nwinning his regular event, the 200 yard<br />\nbackstroke, with a 2.21.5.<br />\nTowson managed to grab a first in the<br />\ndiving, but Hopkins came back and clinched a one-two in the next event, the 200<br />\nYard butterfly.

The freaks were obviously<br />\nstoned.<br /><br />\nwith second place.<br />\nPete Weiss won the 100 yard free, with<br />\na fair time of 55 seconds flat, and Jim<br />\nWood picked up a third. The 500 yard free<br />\nrace turned into a very interesting event,<br />\nwith junior Doc Hersperger swimming<br />\nInto a much-desired first, followed by<br />\nsophomore Bob Wettstein in second. Both<br />\nof these swimmers swam on the final<br />\nwinning free relay, only two events later.<br />\nThe other two members of the relay were<br />\nthe starter, Brian Turner, and anchor<br />\nman Rick Ware.<br />\nThe varsity swimmers were not, however, the only ones to have a good week.<br />\nThe freshman ,team swam time trials and<br />\nbroke several existing University and<br />\nfreshman records. Vince Nigrelli turned in a very fast 200 free, at 1.53.4, to<br />\nset new University record for the 100<br />\nfree.<br />\nMike Boyd swam a 5.17.5, 500 freestyle race and broke his own old University record in the 400 and 1000 yard<br />\nfree.

George Apple, hitting on long<br />\njumpers, and Hal Grinberg helped maintain an 8 to 11 point margin throughout<br />\nthe half.<br />\nThe second half was pretty much the<br />\nsame. Geoff Thomas and Hal Grinberg<br />\nwere the big men in the final period.<br />\nWith 14 minutes to go, the Jays were<br />\nstill up by 13.<br /><br />\nDiplomats Mourn<br />\nLate in the game, the Diplomats began taking chances and committing many<br />\npersonal fouls, as Valvano's squad<br />\nstarted a ball-control offense. The<br />\nHopkins cagers capitalized on the situation by sinking 10 foul shots in a row<br />\nwhile keeping their nine point advantage until the buzzer sounded.<br />\nLeading the scoring for both teams<br />\nwas Hal Grinberg with 26 points.

It<br />\nwas the hucklers eleventh victory in as many outings and set the<br />\nstage for a title match against the Muncie Indiana Pelicans who<br />\nclenched the Sycamore Springs League title last week.<br />\nBoth teams played exceedingly well despite a dense fog enveloping the Hoboken course, nicknamed \"Asthma Acres\" by visiting<br />\nsquads.<br />\nThe Zephyrs raced to an early<br />\nlead on square one with Dudley<br />\nHammock and Channing Jarbeaver<br />\ndisplaying great finesse with a wide<br />\nvariety of whirlawang shots and<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER SPORTS<br />\nhurryaxe placements.

Dork's huckle seemed hopelessly wedged against<br />\nthe dike that holds the water hazard in the middle of the looped<br />\ngrove of twiney trees that makes the fifth square such a difficult<br />\nover-and-under shot. With incredible nonchalance, Dork addressed his huckle and converted a perfect triple reverse that brought<br />\n\"Oohs\" and \"Ahs\" from the partisan Hoboken gallery. At that<br />\npoint Hopkins overtook the lead by a 92 3/4 - 811/4 margin.<br />\nMomentum was in the Blue Jays favor from that point despite the<br />\nloss of Buzz Condom, the Jays star loose-end, who developed a<br />\npesky allergy in the mens rool of the seventh square and was carried<br />\nfrom the course by stretcher.<br /><br />\nBobble Bursts<br />\nAfter 13 rather uneventful minutes in the eighth square,<br />\ntempers<br />\nflaired briefly over a controversial hurryaxe by E.<br />\n\"Digits\" Wurlitzer of the Hopkins secondary.

But<br />\nthe \"neversay-die\" Hoboken tertiary squad, inspired by the<br />\nbrilliant playmaking of Delwood Bobble, fresh from \"the Box\", very<br />\nnearly turned<br />\nthe tables. With only 5 seconds remaining, Bobble<br />\nconverted a<br />\nshakey but colorful left-handed snide, and victory<br />\nwas denied for<br />\nthe Zephyrs due to the loss of precious form<br />\npoints.<br /><br />\nWatch Out, Pelicans<br />\nIn the end, it was Hopkins 147, Hoboken 142 1/4 in one<br />\nof the<br />\nmost unusually close and exciting matches this writer<br />\nhas seen<br />\nin the past decade.<br />\nDuring the post-match festivities, Mayo DeBakey,<br />\nthe Hopkins<br />\nHuckling coach said that although he was concerned<br />\nover Condoms<br />\nloss, he was sure that the Blue Jays would be \"psyched<br />\nup\" for<br />\nthe title match against the Muncie Pelicans. Said<br />\nDeBakey: \"We've<br />\nwaited a long time for this match, and if the Pelicans<br />\nthink that just<br />\nbecause we've lost our Condom we won't be at full<br />\nstrength, well they've got another thing coming.\"<br /><br />\nW. Maryland Pins Blue Jay Grapplers<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nLast Wednesday night, Hopkins' varsity wrestlers dropped a match to the tough Western Maryland Team by the score of 33-5. This now makes<br />\nHopkins' record 3-5 on the season, and 2-2 in<br />\nthe conference.<br />\nDespite the scoring, all the Hopkins' wrestlers fought very well, often losing by two points<br />\nor less.<br />\nDoug Seward, at 126 for Hopkins,<br />\nwrestled Ken Myers to a 4-3 decision loss, setting the pace for the remainder of the evening.<br />\nJeff Turshen was pinned by an excellent wrestler, Gary Sholl, but Betta and Hanemann lost by<br />\nscores of 2-1 and 2-2 decision. (Betta's loss<br />\ncame on one of the referee's most controversial<br />\nstalling calls-in the last four seconds). Betta<br />\nand Hanemann lost to Captain Terry Conover<br />\nand William Blake, a much improved wrestler, which should magnify the strength of their<br /><br />\nperformances.<br />\nIn other matches, Fred Ryland lost to TOM<br />\nBarnes by a score of 5-2, Bob Sanborn and Vernon Myers kept from getting pinned by Leverton and Wayne Gibson great shows of endurance,<br />\nwhile Marshall Capp was pinned by the \"hometown favorite\", Leon Cronce, at heavyweight'<br /><br />\nHigh Point<br />\nThe high point of the evening for Hopkins'<br />\nfans came when Nick Pratt, wrestling at 190,<br />\npinned the Terrors' Kiemle in the third period,<br />\nthus saving the match from a complete loss.<br />\nThe matches were close enough at times to<br />\nmake the ref's calls very controversial and argumentative. But, in conclusion, it was a hard<br />\nfought match by Hopkins against a superior Western Maryland team.<br />\nHopkins' next match will be tomorrow at 3:30<br />\np.m. against Ursinus at the Athletic Center.<br /><br />\nFrosh Lack Depth, Not Desire<br />\nIncluded in Hal Grosh's coaching itinerary along<br />\nwith football and lacrosse is freshmen wrestling.<br />\nCoach Grosh is a former wrestler who previously<br />\ncoached a Baltimore high school and the University<br />\nof Delaware's frosh matmen.<br />\nOne general problem related to the nature of<br />\nthe sport itself is that it is highly individualistic<br />\nand physically demanding, which means personal<br />\nsacrifice. Because of these factors, Coach Grosh<br />\nstates, \"I would never encourage a kid to come<br />\nout for wrestling if he were undecided.\"<br />\nTwo very essential qualities of a goodwrestler<br />\nare attitude and desire. The coach feels that the<br />\nfew members of this year's frosh squad possess<br />\nthese characteristics. Coach Grosh cites two<br />\ngrapplers on his team as outstanding performers;<br />\nthey are Dave Olp and John Ligums. John, who<br />\nis better known as \"Tiny\" and wrestles in the<br />\nunlimited division, tips the scales at 235. \"Tiny\"<br />\nis very strong, and often just literally overpowers<br /><br />\nhis opponents\u2014or, perhaps more applicable, victims, for he is yet undefeated this season and<br />\nhas four straight pins, all in the first period.<br />\nAn obstacle every wrestler has to face is \"making weight\": this is where the sport starts to differ<br />\ndrastically from all others. Although the team may<br />\ngo through a practice with running, situation<br />\nwrestling and scrimmage matches, the individual<br />\nwrestler must make a concerted physical and psychological effort to stay at fighting weight. \"This<br />\nmeans coming from practice and not eating a nice,<br />\nbig meal and walking past a water fountain that<br />\nstands eight feet tall and looks like an oasis,<br />\nbecause the bulk of the weight loss is water.\"<br />\nOne specific problem that Coach Grosh faces<br />\nis the lack of personnel. ,\"We've had to forfeit,<br />\nat times, five matches of the ten weight classes,<br />\nsimply because we didn't have anyone.\"<br /><br />\n/rte.<br />\nI<br />\n1111<br />\nAlthough Buzz Condom will mks the title tilt with the Pelicans, All-America<br />\nn candidate Milo Dork's offensive style.<br />\ncoupled with \"Digits\" Wurlitzer's blood-and-guts desire (as displayed<br />\nin his grapple with Bobble above), give Hopkins<br />\na powerful one-two punch against the highly touted Sycamore Spring Champs..<br /><br />\nMarine Corps Officer selection team will be on camPos<br />\nthe 25th and 26th of February to discuss their officer<br />\nprograms.<br /><br />\n'\"WE GIVE<br /><br />\nDISCOUNTS<br />\nON HI-Fl<br /><br />\nCOMPONENTS<br />\nSONY AR DYNA PIONEER<br />\nGARRARD DUAL BOZAK<br />\nWHARFEDALE KOSS SHUO<br />\nYOUR<br /><br />\nSAMPLE STORE<br />\n3031 Oreenmount Ave.<br />\nin Waverly<br /><br />\nGARRARD<br /><br />\nLIST<br /><br />\nCOST<br /><br />\nSL95-B<br />\nSL72-B<br />\nSL55-B<br />\nSL40-B<br /><br />\n129.50<br />\n89.50<br />\n59.50<br />\n44.50<br /><br />\n89.89<br />\n65.89<br />\n43.89<br />\n33.89<br /><br />\nHI-FIDELITY \u2022<br />\nCENTER<br />\nThe House of Low Low Prices<br />\n317W.

He<br />\ndescribed several innovations in the<br />\nprogram, such as the complete outpatient coverage, including psychiatry,<br />\nwhich is not part of the other prepaid<br />\nprograms.<br />\nAccording to Navarro, the new health<br />\nprogram will aim at ending all discrimination toward patients on the ability<br />\nto pay. Presently, this discrimination<br />\nis one of the reasons for the poor's<br />\nInferior health care.<br />\nA prepaid health program allows the<br />\nsubscriber to pay a flat fee each year.<br />\nThe program would then assume the<br />\ncosts of all the subscriber's medical<br />\nbills. This practice is known as third<br />\nparty payments.<br />\nThese payments have been contracted<br />\nby the State Medicaid program,the Office<br />\nof Economic Opportunity and the Depart-<br /><br />\nThe following is an outline of the<br />\nreport by the Health Task Force of the<br />\nUrban Coalition entitled Rx for Action.<br />\nIt discusses the problems and possible<br />\ncures for the inadequate medical health<br />\nservices in slum areas.<br /><br />\nDr. Torre Brown, director of the East<br />\nBaltimore project: \"The community decides with an equal voice the services to<br />\nbe provided.\"<br />\nment of Health, Education and Welfare.<br />\nIt is hoped by the Hospital and East<br />\nBaltimore Corporation that the above<br />\nagencies will allow the patients to achieve<br />\nthe same or better care than presently<br />\nat a lower overall cost.<br />\nThe doctors and staff of the health<br />\nprogram will receive bonuses depending on the economy of the services. This<br />\nshould help eliminate some of the waste<br />\nin current medical practices, a Hospital<br />\nspokesman remarked.<br />\nThe East Baltimore Community Corporation is comprised of area residents,<br />\nrepresentatives from Model Cities agencies and two Hopkins staff members.<br />\nThe seventeen members of the Corporation board will be augmented by seventeen to twenty-five people selected from<br />\nthe enrollees of the program. \"We didn't<br />\nhave anything to do with picking the people<br />\non the board,\" commented Robert<br />\nDirector<br />\nHeyssel,<br />\nHospital's<br />\nthe<br />\n(continued on page 11)<br /><br />\nThe United States contains 25 million<br />\nurban poor who suffer disproportionately from ill-health. Pollution of air and<br />\nwater, malnutrition, crowded housing<br />\nconditions, inadequate waste disposal<br />\nprograms and the abundance of rats and<br />\nother germ carriers abound in our slums.<br />\nThe irony of the situation is that the<br />\ninner city, which undoubtedly requires<br />\nthe best health facilities to combat<br />\nthe environmental conditions, has the<br />\nworst.<br />\nIn the slums the physicianpopulation ratio is between one-half to<br />\none-fifth that of the city as a whole.<br />\nThe absence of conveniently located<br />\nhealth centers, the lack of time for<br />\ndoctors to thoroughly examine the patients, the shortage of adequate funds to<br />\ntreat patients and the virtual nonexistence of preventive medical services<br />\nare the realities to the slumclweller.<br />\nSuch deficient health services severely impair the effectiveness and strength<br />\nof the residents of such an area. It has<br />\nbeen especially noted that malnutrition,<br />\nwhich exists to an alarming degree in<br />\nour urban slums and rural areas, has<br />\na definite effect on the physical and<br />\nmental abilities of an unborn child.<br />\nIn order to overcome these problems, the Urban Coalition urged the<br />\nFederal Government to take the lead<br />\nin initiating new policies for disadvantaged areas. A national campaign to<br />\nfinance medical costs, improve the organization of medical services and supply manpower are fundamental goals<br />\nenvisioned by the Coalition with Federal loans, investments and grants the<br />\nCoalition proposes to implement these<br />\nplans.<br />\nHowever, without direction from suc-<br /><br />\ncessful local action programs, Federal<br />\nefforts will flounder. Those who argue<br />\nfor massive infusions of Federal funds<br />\nalone should be aware that previous experience does not support them. Multibillion dollar investmeqts without cost<br />\ncontrols, through Medicare and Medicaid<br />\nof the Social Security Act, have resulted<br />\nin a terrifying inflation of the cost of medical care, with only a small improvement<br />\nin service avaliability.<br />\nAvailiability of qualified manpower is<br />\nalso necessary to improve the inadequacies of the present system. Millions of<br />\ndollars have been spent for research and<br />\npostgraduate training in medical specialties. It has not, however, been directed<br />\nprimarily toward<br />\nincreasing medical<br />\nmanpower number and,in fact has resulted in only a minute increase in the medical student pool and graduating class<br />\nnumbers.<br />\nFinally, and most importantly, it<br />\nshould be the members of the community who play the essential role in deciding the priorities for their local medical<br />\nhealth center. The Coalition believes<br />\nthat local health task forces can provide<br />\nleadership to the community for moving<br />\nfrom talk to action. A local coalition<br />\ncan catalyze action by bringing to the<br />\nattention of the community, particularlY<br />\nthe political leaders and businessmen,<br />\ninformation about the health status and<br />\nhealth needs of deprived segments of the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nToo often the realities of deprivation<br />\nare not known by those community leaders. Not only excess death and illness,<br />\nbut even the extraordinary difficulties<br />\ninvolved in obtaining needed medical<br />\ncare, such as the distance to the clinic,<br />\nthe long waits and the lack of emergencY<br />\ncare are not normally realized.<br />\nThis is partially due to the myth that<br />\nmedical care in the United States is the<br />\nbest in the world for the \"majority\" of<br />\nthe people. Tied in with this, is a second myth that the poor and the rich get<br />\n(continued on page 11)<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nGras(s) Hirting<br />\nThis year's Mardi Gras has been the drunkest and the<br />\nmost violent in many years. Scores have been arrested<br />\nfor robbery, fighting and carrying weapons.

He was hit in the mouth with a brick thrown<br />\nfrom the crowd, while riding in a float. He does not know<br />\nwhether he will be able to play the trumpet again.<br /><br />\nDraft Deaths<br />\nThe war in Vietnam has claimed the lives of more<br />\nthan 12,000 draftees since 1965, the Pentagon announced yesterday. Broken down on an individual basis,<br />\nthis means that approximately one out of every 104<br />\ndraftees has died in combat.<br />\nThe figures also reveal that 33% of all combat<br />\n1 deaths have been among draftees, and that in the<br />\nArmy, which is bearing the brunt of the fighting,<br />\nthe percentage of draftee combat deaths reaches 50%,<br />\nFurthermore, the statistics are out of date, since<br />\nthey only cover the period from June 1965 to June,<br />\n1969.<br />\nThe Army's figures are most interesting, since<br />\nit was announced that the draftee mortality rate was<br /><br />\nhigher than was the percentage of draftees in the<br />\nCurrently, the Army relies upon induction<br />\nfor only 40% of its manpower.<br />\nThe facts were released in response to a New<br />\nYork Times Magazine article in which it was stated<br />\nthat as the war lengthened, it was likely that more<br />\ndraftees would be used as infantrymen, and that consequently they would be forced to carry out and share<br />\nmore of the fighting. It has already been shown that<br />\nInductees are more likely than volunteers to be used<br />\nas infantry riflemen.<br />\nA Pentagon spokesman denied that there is any<br />\ndeliberate policy on the deployment of draftees, but<br />\nhe explained that volunteers are given greater choice<br />\nas to where they are to serve and what duties they<br />\nare to carry out.<br /><br />\nservice.<br /><br />\nDow 7-'Guilty'<br />\nSeven of the members of an anti-war group that destroyed files and equipment at the Washington offices of the Dow<br />\nChemical Company last March have been found guilty on<br />\ntwo counts of malicious destruction of property and one of<br />\nunlawful entry.<br />\nThe charges followed a raid on Dow's offices when the<br />\ngroup--which includes four priests and a nun--poured<br />\nhuman blood on papers and furniture, and threw files out<br />\nof a fourth-story window.<br />\nThroughout the six-day trial, the defendants were repeatedly silenced by Judge John H.

Two of the original nine defendants changed their<br />\npleas from innocent to no-contest midway through the<br />\ntrial, claiming that the proceedings were dehumanizing.<br />\nThree of the defendants and one of their attorneys were<br />\ncited for contempt.<br />\nLast Friday, there was a scuffle between spectators,<br />\nmarshals, and one of the defendants. The defendant was<br />\ncited for contempt. In his summation, Tuesday,one of the<br />\ndefendants told the jury, \"To destroy property that has<br />\nno right to exist is not violence.
