The sentiment on the campus seems<br />\nto be overwhelmingly in favor of the continuance of class rivalry in<br />\nconjunction with the lower class banquets.<br />\nThe present Freshman Class must, next spring, set a precedent<br />\nfor future years. The Faculty, it seems, will not interfere as long<br />\nas any accompanying \"disorders\" remain \"minor\" and as long as<br />\nno men are forcibly detained from classes. In the past, Faculty intreference has not proved pleasent to those men who were the objects<br />\nof the attention. There seems but one course for future under-classmen to pursue : they must remain within the stipulated bounds.<br />\nWe would suggest, that if the Class of 1926 feels that their. banquet next spring will not prove a success without the presence of<br />\ndesirable members of the Class of 1927, no attempt be made to capture these men until after four P. M. of the day on which the banquet<br />\nis to be held.

Since then,<br />\nthe original plan of marking has been restored, and indications seem<br />\nto point to the fact that the University will regain its place of honor.<br />\nThe officers in charge of the unit, however, are determined to take<br />\nno chances on an unfavorable -decision.

The sentiment on the campus seems<br />\nto be overwhelmingly in favor of the continuance of class rivalry in<br />\nconjunction with the lower class banquets.<br />\nThe present Freshman Class must, next spring, set a precedent<br />\nfor future years. The Faculty, it seems, will not interfere as long<br />\nas any accompanying \"disorders\" remain \"minor\" and as long as<br />\nno men are forcibly detained from classes. In the past, Faculty intreference has not proved pleasent to those men who were the objects<br />\nof the attention. There seems but one course for future under-classmen to pursue : they must remain within the stipulated bounds.<br />\nWe would suggest, that if the Class of 1926 feels that their. banquet next spring will not prove a success without the presence of<br />\ndesirable members of the Class of 1927, no attempt be made to capture these men until after four P. M. of the day on which the banquet<br />\nis to be held.

Since then,<br />\nthe original plan of marking has been restored, and indications seem<br />\nto point to the fact that the University will regain its place of honor.<br />\nThe officers in charge of the unit, however, are determined to take<br />\nno chances on an unfavorable -decision.
