IRC opened 62 medical centers. Staffed by 360 refugee doctors, nurses and pharmacists.<br />\nThey treated 250,000 people a month.<br />\nWe also opened 51 schools in the camps staffed<br />\nby 714 refugee teachers.<br />\nThese schools served an important function.<br />\nNearly half the refugees in the camps were children.<br />\nMany of whom had seen their parents killed right<br />\nbefore their eyes.<br />\nThe schools kept the children occupied. And<br />\nby keeping them occupied,fought the corrosiveness<br />\nof despair.<br />\n<br />\nBut we're just at the beginning. So<br />\nmuch more has to be done.<br />\nIRC has been asked to provide medical and paramedical personnel for 1000 children's feeding centers, plus 60 mobile dispensaries.<br />\nNo one volunteer agency can do the<br />\njob alone. We ask your help.<br />\n<br />\nHow you can help.<br />\n<br />\nIn Bangladesh, millions of children are in desperate need of medical<br />\nattention.

But<br />\nthey have returned to find their homes destroyed.<br />\n\"Isheir crops destroyed. Even members of their families destroyed.<br />\nIn addition, they have found that another 10<br />\nmillion are uprooted and homeless, like themselves.<br />\nMany are without food,without medicine,without hope.<br />\n\"To help alleviate their suffering,IRC has established a network of 33 medical centers and dispensaries. We're planning more.<br />\nOnce again, these IRC medical centers are<br />\nstaffed by Bengali doctors, nurses and paramedical<br />\npersonnel. Many of whom worked in IRC medical<br />\nunits in India.<br />\nAs in all conflicts, it's the children who suffer<br />\nmost. In Bangladesh,they are in dire need of medical<br />\nattention.<br />\nIRC is in the process ofsetting up an emergency<br />\nprogram to provide badly undernourished children<br />\nwith massive doses of Vitamin A. This will at least<br />\nprevent them from going blind.<br />\nIn Dacca, we're setting up a special women's<br />\nclinic with a complete medical staff to treat those<br />\ngirls who were raped by Pakistani soldiers and are<br />\nnow pregnant. Many were fourteen, fifteen and<br />\nsixteen years Old.<br />\nWe're also participating in the fight to ward off<br />\na cholera epidemic.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough Bengali doctors and nurses work<br />\nfor next to nothing, they still need a subsistence allowance to survive,and to take care<br />\nof their families.<br />\n$100 can put a doctor and nurse to<br />\nwork in an IRC medical center for a month.<br />\nThey in turn can save thousands of lives.<br />\nAlso, if Bangladesh is to survive as a<br />\nnation, they must fill the vacuum created<br />\nby the loss of doctors, scientists, engineers<br />\nand technicians killed by the Pakistanis.<br />\nSo at the personal request of Sheik<br />\nMujibur Rahman,Prime Minister of Bangladesh, IRC has begun a program to get<br />\n10,000 Bengali students back into schools<br />\nand colleges. This is a start in helping to rebuild the<br />\nshattered professional class.<br />\nIt costs $11 a month to keep a student in school.<br />\n$132 a year.<br />\nSince millions of Bengalis are in need of medical<br />\naid and schooling, thousands upon thousands of<br />\ndollars are needed.<br />\nYou can help by sending us whatever you can<br />\nafford.<br />\n<br />\nAmericans always respond generously.<br />\nHelping victims of oppression is ingrained in the<br />\nAmerican spirit.<br />\nPerhaps that's because we ourselves were once<br />\nvictims of oppression.

The decision to discontinue the ads was made by<br />\nthe News-Letter's Board of Control Wednesday night.<br />\nThis decision is just an extension of existing editorial<br />\npolicy, for nearly everything appearing in this newspaper is subject to editorial judgements. Stories are<br />\nassigned because we feel they are important to our<br />\nreaders. Their content is inspected and edited before<br />\nthey are printed. However, advertising content is<br />\nanother story. An advertiser pays his money, and fills<br />\nhis alloted space with just about whatever he wishes.<br />\nSo, the Board of Control has no final authority to<br />\nmake an advertiser change his copy; our only option is<br />\nto accept or to reject the advertisement. Thus, the<br />\nNews-Letter's ad policy is determined not by the<br />\ncontent of printed ads, but by the types of ads they<br />\nare<br />\nMost advertising is a vital and important part of any<br />\nnewspaper. Not only does it provide much of the<br />\nmoney necessary for publishing, but it informs readers<br />\nconcerning what to buy,what they need and what to do<br />\nfor entertainment: Ads for job interviews, for instance,<br />\nare a very important service. But ads for termpaper<br />\nreference services and for abortion and family planning<br />\nagencies which charge a fee are not included in what<br />\nthe News-Letter believes to be this more important<br />\ncategory.<br />\nSo, the Board of Control, made up of the paper's<br />\neditorial staff, decided by a majority vote to eliminate<br />\nthese ads. The criteria used in the vote concerned our<br />\n<br />\naims for the News-Letter: to inform the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity and to maintain our credibility, the lack of<br />\nwhich could threaten our effectiveness.<br />\nReactions from all segments of the community, as<br />\nwell as from outside the University, indicate that our<br />\nstanding has been questioned as a result of these<br />\nadvertisements. Involved in this standing is not just our<br />\nprestige, but our factual veracity, our editorial backing<br />\nand our ability to serve the community. When we<br />\npublish a story in the News-Letter, or take an editorial<br />\nstand, we do so because we feel that the community<br />\nshould know about it. But to run ads which could be<br />\nconstrued as undercutting the value of this educational<br />\nservice, is something we cannot allow to happen.<br />\nSo, these ads are not going to run any longer: but<br />\nthis does not mean that the News-Letter will not<br />\ncontinue to publish articles that might arouse controversy, or advertising that might seem offensive to some.<br />\nThis newspaper's goal is to inform and serve the<br />\nUniversity community. That is the way almost any<br />\nnewspaper works, and that is the way we will.<br />\nBut the advertising copy, a part of the paper that is<br />\nset apart from the rest of the paper am n that it is an<br />\nall-or-nothing proposition, is something more complicated. If certain kinds of advertising, such as these two<br />\nkinds, will jeopardize our objectives, then the entire<br />\nHopkins community will lose. The News-Letter is the<br />\nmost effective means of communication in the University, and if it loses some of its effectiveness because of<br />\ncertain advertisements, then everyone would lose. And<br />\nthe blame could be placed on us, the Board of Control.<br />\nWe just don't want that to happen.<br />\n<br />\n\"Oh<br />\nAt First I Thought<br />\nThat Was Marijuana Smoke !\"<br />\n<br />\nPfeffer replies to attacks on China dispatch<br />\nThe following column received from<br />\nChina was written by Ric Pfeffer in<br />\ndefense of his dispatch published in the<br />\nNews-Letter on February 29 entitled \"A<br />\nChina of Unprecedented Prosperity.\"<br />\nThe purpose of my dispatch from<br />\nChina was twofold: first, to refute certain<br />\nof the most blatant distortions about<br />\nChinese life that pervaded our mass<br />\nmedia for the last twenty-odd years; and<br />\nsecond, to suggest from what I could tell<br />\nthat the Chinese government, party and<br />\narmy has been striving with substantial<br />\nsuccess to serve its people. If one hopes<br />\nto understand China today, one must<br />\nbegin, I believe, with the reality that<br />\nChina is a decent, if imperfect, society.<br />\nThe facts presented in the article are<br />\nnot in dispute; nor do they appear to be<br />\ncontrovertible. The examples and<br />\nonly too typical\u2014as G.M. Hooks would<br />\nbe the first to note\u2014ofthe more accurate<br />\nreporting on China in our<br />\n<br />\nmass media<br />\n<br />\nthat has prevailed since American politics<br />\nrecently reshaped the bounds of what<br />\nconstitutes \"professional reporting\"<br />\nabout the People's Republic.<br />\nThe dispute, I conclude then, must be<br />\nessentially about whether China is a<br />\ndecent society, whether its institutions<br />\ndo in fact tend to \"serve the people.\" Mr.<br />\n(Ms.?) Hooks accuses me of sins of<br />\ncommission, while Mr. Fleischman<br />\naccuses me of sins of omission.<br />\nG.M. Hooks, in the section of his (her)<br />\nletter concerned with my article,<br />\nmaintains first that I have confused<br />\n\"consumerism with political analysis,\"<br />\nand second that what is \"obnoxious\"<br />\nabout my reporting is not its lack of<br />\nobjectivity but \"rather...my puerile desire<br />\nto make China palatable to exactly the<br />\npetit bourgeois tastes that both...I and<br />\nFleischman express.\" For myself, I plead<br />\nguilty to the second count of the<br />\nindictment, but not to the first.<br />\nIt is my belief that a revolution\u2014or,<br />\nfor that matter, the status quo\u2014should be<br />\njudged by how well it serves the people.<br />\nIn my piece I tried to give a few examples<br />\nof ways in which the Chinese government<br />\nhas indeed served its people: by<br />\nextending cooperative health service to<br />\n<br />\nthe poorest peasants; by obligating cadres<br />\nto seek first hand experience of the<br />\nquality of life of the hundreds of millions<br />\nof peasants, over whose lives they have so<br />\nmuch influence; by substantially raising<br />\nthe material standard of living of its<br />\npopulation etc.<br />\nDoes G.M. Hooks believe a revolution<br />\nshould not raise the material standard of<br />\nliving of its people? Or is it Hooks who<br />\nfails to make elementary distinctions<br />\nbetween providing a standard of living<br />\nabove subsistence and \"consumerism?\"<br />\nSurely what I described can hardly be<br />\ncalled \"consumerism,\" though living in<br />\nAmerica one can understand Hooks'<br />\nnatural oversensitivity to the problem, a<br />\nsensitivity undoubtedly irritated by my<br />\n\"puerile desire\" to cummunicate these<br />\naspects of Chinese life to a largely middle<br />\netas% American audience_ In his pristine<br />\nCIC;f-A77T I3<br />\n<br />\n\u201c<br />\nITISTarraTC:;- rrorri<br />\n,<br />\n.571.7-C1,11<br />\n<br />\nimmature concerns.<br />\nAs to the substance<br />\n<br />\nof Avrom<br />\n<br />\nFleischman's letter, Fleischman expresses<br />\nhis unassailable concern for \"human<br />\nfreedom\u201d and rebukes me for not having<br />\nreported on this \"intangible.\"<br />\nSpecifically, as self-appointed guardian of<br />\nall that we of the free world hold dear, he<br />\ninquires rhetorically of religious freedom<br />\nin China, of the human side of cadre<br />\nre-education, and of the extent of<br />\nintellectual freedom in China.<br />\nBefore responding specifically, let me<br />\nmake three general points. First, I did not<br />\nfeel it necessary in a 1300 word article to<br />\ndescribe all aspects of Chinese society. I<br />\nchose the limited and relatively easy task<br />\nof rebutting several gross stereotypes, not<br />\nthe more complex task of re-defining<br />\nother, more subtle caricatures of China<br />\nthat hardly need simple repetition.<br />\nSelf-serving descriptions of the<br />\nrestrictions on individual freedom in<br />\nChina have been drilled into the skulls of<br />\nAmericans for over two decades, since<br />\nbirth for most students at Hopkins.<br />\nSecond, I made no claims that China is a<br />\nliberal society; nor is it. I stated that in<br />\nChina \"self and collective discipline<br />\nremain the order of the day,\" that China<br />\nis a \"reasonably highly organized<br />\nsociety.\" And third, while I can<br />\nappreciate Fleischman's attachment to<br />\n<br />\nhis vision of \"human freedom,\"<br />\nwha\"human\" implies and what is meant<br />\nby \"freedom,\" has been a matter of<br />\ndispute for centuries. Judging by his<br />\nexamples, Fleischman seems by \"human<br />\nfreedom\" to mean the individual's<br />\nfreedom from governmental authority,<br />\nwhat Isiah Berlin has called \"negative<br />\nfreedom.\" But surely historical practice,<br />\nas well as the history of political theory,<br />\nmakes it abundantly clear that such<br />\n\"freedom\" often is in conflict with the<br />\neffective freedom of other individuals<br />\nand with the best interests of the<br />\ncollective, of which the individual is a<br />\npart.<br />\nChina has chosen to emphasize the<br />\ncollective interest, frequently at the<br />\nexpense of individual freedom,at least as<br />\n<br />\nspoke indicated that he or she felt the<br />\ncadre school had been a very healthy<br />\nexperience. Several said, disarmingly, that<br />\nthey were sorry they hadn't been able to<br />\nstay longer. I believed them. At the two<br />\ncadre schools I visited, the cadres also<br />\nsoomed quite proud of their high degree<br />\nof self-reliance in constructing their own<br />\nbuildings, reclaiming some of their own<br />\nland, cultivating their own crops, etc.<br />\nWith regard to the question of<br />\nintellectual freedom, I do share some of<br />\nthe same values as Mr. Fleischman,<br />\nthough I am much more skeptical than he<br />\nappears to be about the limits and<br />\nsignificance of intellectual freedom in the<br />\nU.S. But, more than that, it should be<br />\nunderstood that intellectual freedom in<br />\npractice is largely the property of the<br />\n<br />\nRamblers. later on his own.

They recorded for<br />\nsuch companies as Arhoolie, Decca, and<br />\nVocalion\u2014labels which were also among<br />\nthe first to issue recordings of the early<br />\nblack bluesmen.<br />\nMany of the songs these minstrels sang<br />\nwere culled directly from the folk<br />\ntradition of the Southeast; others were<br />\nwritten by the musicians\u2014the product of<br />\ntheir encounter with other folk<br />\nforms\u2014notably the blues. Soon such<br />\nmusic developed an idiom of its own,and<br />\nwas brought to Nashville in the form of<br />\nthe Carter Family, Jimmy Rogers, Bill<br />\nMonroe,and Earl Scruggs.<br />\nMike Seeger has been playing and<br />\nsinging this music for many years now,<br />\nfirst as a member of the New Lost City<br />\n<br />\nA new kind offestival<br />\n^<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nfirst<br />\n<br />\nA rvirrla tiort<br />\n<br />\nannual 'USA-International<br />\nVirck<br />\n<br />\nFtcld<br />\n<br />\nFontainebleau Hotel in Miami 13eacti. The<br />\nemphasis on this festival is not merely<br />\n<br />\nartistic; there are already three such<br />\n<br />\nanimation festivals, in France, Rumania,<br />\nand Yugoslavia.<br />\nMintz wants to provide an<br />\ninternational marketplace, serving those,<br />\nwith both artistic and business interests.<br />\nHe has invited animators, graphic<br />\ndesigners, producers, distributors, buyers<br />\nfor television programs, advertising<br />\nagencies, educators, manufacturers and<br />\nsuppliers, the video-cassette and<br />\nvideo-recording firms and many others<br />\nfrom all over the world. One of his press<br />\nreleases emphasizes: \"Designed to<br />\nprovide important new services to the<br />\nfilm world, the USA-International<br />\nAnimation Film Festival will not be<br />\nanother cumbersome addition to the<br />\nalready bulging valise that epitomizes<br />\ntoday's film festival scene.\"<br />\nThis is not to say that the IAFF will<br />\nonly be a marketplace; an international<br />\njury composed of representatives from<br />\ntelevision, the press, and the animated<br />\nfilm industry itself (including a<br />\n12-year-old boy,) will award prizes to the<br />\nbest films in each category. Mintz also<br />\nplans to hold lectures and symposia to<br />\nexplore artistic, commercial and technical<br />\ndevelopments of the animated film.<br />\nPackage Tours<br />\nThe choice of Miami Beach as a<br />\nlocation for the festival will undoubtedly<br />\nbe an additional incitement to attend this<br />\nfestival, and the planners have already<br />\nworked out package tours to Cape<br />\nKennedy and Disney World, as well as a<br />\nstaggering array of recreational facilities:<br />\n(unlimited complimentary golf, day and<br />\nnight tennis, bowling, billiards,<br />\nice-skating on the only rink in the South,<br />\nsailboats, and, of course, the sunny<br />\nAtlantic Ocean).<br />\nThe IAFF has that air of organization<br />\nabout it which in the past has ensured<br />\nsuccess. Mintz is a relative newcomer to<br />\nthe film festival scene, having attempted<br />\nit only once before, with the First (and<br />\nlast) Annual Rochester International<br />\nFilm Festival. The problem in Rochester,<br />\nN.Y., was the existence of a certain<br />\nindustry, connected intimately with the<br />\nfilm business, who wanted to have the<br />\nRochester film festival very much under<br />\ntheir control, attempting to emasculate<br />\nthe festival by removing the controversial<br />\nfilms. With the refusal of censorship by<br />\nthe planners, the artistic success of the<br />\nfestival was insured, but the financial<br />\naspects took a slight downturn.<br />\nWith this second try, which is certainly<br />\nmore innovative and potentially<br />\nprofitable, Mintz stands an excellent<br />\nchance of holding a very successful film<br />\nfestival, making some money in the<br />\nprocess, and giving a tremendous boost to<br />\nthe cartoon facet of film-making.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage '10/n.ews-ietter/april 7, 1972<br />\n<br />\nMonument rises over quaint square<br />\nBy ROBERT PAULUS<br />\nMost residents of Baltimore<br />\nare familiar with the Washington<br />\nMonument towering above<br />\nquaint Mount Vernon Place, but<br />\nfew people outside of a handful<br />\nof tourists, small children and<br />\nhistory buffs ever bother to<br />\nclimb its 228 steps.<br />\nBuilt upon a small hill in the<br />\nmiddle of Charles Street at<br />\n<br />\nMonument Street, the<br />\nWashington Monument is located<br />\nin one of the historical and<br />\ncultural centers of Baltimore.<br />\nCobblestone and brick still pave<br />\nthe streets encircling the<br />\nMonument and the surrounding<br />\narea.

Ehrlichman, Assistant<br />\nto the President for Domestic<br />\nAffairs, was the guest speaker at<br />\nthe Milford H. Whitehill<br />\nLeadership Seminar Wednesday<br />\nafternoon in the library's Garrett<br />\nRoom.<br />\nSpeaking to a group of<br />\nspecially invited student leaders<br />\nand members of the faculty and<br />\nadministration, Ehrlichman<br />\noutlined some of the main<br />\ndomestic problems he saw facing<br />\nthe country and urged patience<br />\nin finding their appropriate<br />\nsolutions. The four main areas he<br />\nnoted were taxation, the conflict<br />\nbetween energy and the<br />\nenvironment, responsiveness of<br />\ngovernment, and the<br />\nmaldistribution of our<br />\npopulation.<br />\n\"We have a critical mismatch<br />\nof responsibilities and revenues in<br />\nour federal government,\" noted<br />\nEhrlichman with regard to our<br />\ntax structure. He called for tax<br />\nreform which would. promote<br />\n<br />\n\"equity of application, equity in<br />\nlevy, practical linkage between<br />\nlevels of government, practical<br />\nlimits on what you can tax, and<br />\nsimplicity.\"<br />\nHorse and Buggy<br />\n\"While at the federal level we<br />\nhave a highly desirable revenue<br />\nsystem,\" Ehrlichman remarked,<br />\n\"the states and localities have<br />\nhad to resort to horse and buggy<br />\ntaxes.\" He claimed this resulted<br />\nfrom the federal government's<br />\nhaving the money while the<br />\nlocalities have been carrying the<br />\nincreasing burden of problems.<br />\nHe saw revenue-sharing as a<br />\ntemporary measure to funnel<br />\nresponsibilities and funds back to<br />\nthe local governments.<br />\nObserving recent talk about<br />\ntax loopholes, the President's<br />\nassistant called for a re-evaluation<br />\nof why certain deductions and<br />\nloopholes were instituted in the<br />\nfirst place.<br />\nCongress, in Ehrlichman's<br />\nview, presents the chief obstacle<br />\nto a simplification of the tax<br />\n<br />\nstructure. \"Inertia runs against<br />\nchange, and Congressmen are<br />\nresponsive to that inertia,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nEnergy<br />\nEhrlichman pinpointed the<br />\nconflict between the need for<br />\ngreater energy and the desire to<br />\npreserve the environment. \"Even<br />\nif our production of energy<br />\ncontinues on its upward curve,<br />\nwe will still face a shortage in<br />\nseven years,\" he observed. On the<br />\nother hand, he said, the need to<br />\nfight pollution as well makes it<br />\nnecessary to reconcile these two<br />\ncrucial situations.<br />\n\"In the last 30 years, local<br />\nunits of government have slowly<br />\n\u2022but surely atrophied. The action<br />\nhas gravitated towards the federal<br />\ngovernment,\" Ehrlichman<br />\n.remarked in discussing the<br />\nquestion of responsiveness. He<br />\nsaw the Nixon administration's<br />\ndecentralization and<br />\nreorganization proposals as<br />\n'offering a remedy to this<br />\nproblem.<br />\nFinally, Ehrlichman pointed to<br />\nthe shifting of our population<br />\nfrom the midwegt to either coast<br />\nas signaling a potentially grave<br />\nproblem for the future.

One of these, the<br />\nEmanual-Crawford bill, was<br />\nheard yesterday in the house<br />\nJudiciary proceedings committee.<br />\nAn aide in the office of<br />\nSenator Meyer Emanuel gave it a<br />\n\"favorable\" chance of passing<br />\nbefore this year's legislative<br />\nsession ends on Monday.<br />\nThe action of the House<br />\ncommittee in hearing the bill this<br />\nYear was unexpected. As recently<br />\nas the day before yesterday,<br />\nEllery Woodworth, Special<br />\nAssistant to the President,<br /><br />\nconsidered the<br />\nEmanual-Crawford bill \"as dead<br />\nas a doornail.\"<br />\nHe added though, that activity<br />\nin the House sessions could<br />\nalways change very quickly from<br />\nday to day The Conroy-Cullen<br />\nbill, another piece of similar<br />\nlegislation, introduced in the<br />\nSenate and passed there March<br />\n27, is still awaiting a hearing in<br />\nthe House Committee on<br />\nEconomic Matters.<br />\nThe other bill was introduced<br />\ninto the State House of Delegates<br />\nby Delegate Glazer, and recently<br />\npassed its second reading in the<br />\nHouse.<br />\nFour Bills Defeated<br />\nThe Emanuel-Crawford bill<br /><br />\nincludes provisions for 18 year<br />\nold voting and car ownership as<br />\nwell as drinking.

He noted that<br />\noutside support in the form of<br />\nletters and telegrams was a vital<br />\n\"pusher\" to ensure that any bill<br />\nwas promptly heard and enacted<br />\nupon by a House Committee<br /><br />\ncoverage plan,remarked,\"Students<br />\njust don't get that sick.\"<br />\nThe current plan includes a<br />\nmaternity benefit for an extra<br />\n$55 premium for which the<br />\nmaximum payment on a normal<br />\npregnancy is $100.<br />\nThe current plan does not<br />\ninclude major medical coverage<br />\nfor injuries received in<br />\nautomobile accidents, and only<br />\nallows $200 for any services<br />\nrendered by a hospital to a<br />\npatient during his hospital stay.<br />\nSophomore Richard Fritz, who<br />\nhas worked as a hospital orderly<br />\nin Pittsburgh, stated, \"$200<br />\nwould be adequate for minor<br /><br />\nTrustee panel holds<br />\nnominee interviews<br />\nBy MICHAEL WEISSMAN<br /><br />\nNewinsurance plan<br />\nunder consideration<br />\nBy RICHARD WARING<br />\nCoverage offered by the<br />\nHopkins student health insurance<br />\nplan may be improved next year<br />\nIf the University decides to<br />\naccept a new plan being offered<br />\nby Blue-Cross Blue Shield.<br />\nDetails of the plan are not yet<br />\navailable.<br />\nAlso under consideration by<br />\nmembers of the administration<br />\nare the possibilities of keeping<br />\nthe current health- plan which<br />\noffers limited coverage for a<br />\npremium of $30 a year and also<br />\nof accepting a new, more<br />\ncomprehensive plan being offered<br />\nby the present insurer, the<br />\nGuarentee Trust Life Insurance<br />\nCompany of Chicago.

They should<br />\nask what the students want.\"<br />\nBates added that<br />\nadministrators should determine<br />\nwhether or not students want a<br />\nmore comprehensive plan. He<br />\nalso noted, \"I think it's kind of<br />\nstupid if they don't get any<br />\nstudent input, that would hurt<br />\nthe University.\"<br />\nDenton stated, \"We're<br />\nconsidering both the alternatives<br />\nof keeping the present cost and<br />\nraising it.

In Bangladesh,they are in dire need of medical<br />\nattention.<br />\nIRC is in the process ofsetting up an emergency<br />\nprogram to provide badly undernourished children<br />\nwith massive doses of Vitamin A. This will at least<br />\nprevent them from going blind.<br />\nIn Dacca, we're setting up a special women's<br />\nclinic with a complete medical staff to treat those<br />\ngirls who were raped by Pakistani soldiers and are<br />\nnow pregnant.

The decision to discontinue the ads was made by<br />\nthe News-Letter's Board of Control Wednesday night.<br />\nThis decision is just an extension of existing editorial<br />\npolicy, for nearly everything appearing in this newspaper is subject to editorial judgements. Stories are<br />\nassigned because we feel they are important to our<br />\nreaders. Their content is inspected and edited before<br />\nthey are printed. However, advertising content is<br />\nanother story. An advertiser pays his money, and fills<br />\nhis alloted space with just about whatever he wishes.<br />\nSo, the Board of Control has no final authority to<br />\nmake an advertiser change his copy; our only option is<br />\nto accept or to reject the advertisement. Thus, the<br />\nNews-Letter's ad policy is determined not by the<br />\ncontent of printed ads, but by the types of ads they<br />\nare<br />\nMost advertising is a vital and important part of any<br />\nnewspaper. Not only does it provide much of the<br />\nmoney necessary for publishing, but it informs readers<br />\nconcerning what to buy,what they need and what to do<br />\nfor entertainment: Ads for job interviews, for instance,<br />\nare a very important service. But ads for termpaper<br />\nreference services and for abortion and family planning<br />\nagencies which charge a fee are not included in what<br />\nthe News-Letter believes to be this more important<br />\ncategory.<br />\nSo, the Board of Control, made up of the paper's<br />\neditorial staff, decided by a majority vote to eliminate<br />\nthese ads. The criteria used in the vote concerned our<br /><br />\naims for the News-Letter: to inform the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity and to maintain our credibility, the lack of<br />\nwhich could threaten our effectiveness.<br />\nReactions from all segments of the community, as<br />\nwell as from outside the University, indicate that our<br />\nstanding has been questioned as a result of these<br />\nadvertisements. Involved in this standing is not just our<br />\nprestige, but our factual veracity, our editorial backing<br />\nand our ability to serve the community. When we<br />\npublish a story in the News-Letter, or take an editorial<br />\nstand, we do so because we feel that the community<br />\nshould know about it. But to run ads which could be<br />\nconstrued as undercutting the value of this educational<br />\nservice, is something we cannot allow to happen.<br />\nSo, these ads are not going to run any longer: but<br />\nthis does not mean that the News-Letter will not<br />\ncontinue to publish articles that might arouse controversy, or advertising that might seem offensive to some.<br />\nThis newspaper's goal is to inform and serve the<br />\nUniversity community. That is the way almost any<br />\nnewspaper works, and that is the way we will.<br />\nBut the advertising copy, a part of the paper that is<br />\nset apart from the rest of the paper am n that it is an<br />\nall-or-nothing proposition, is something more complicated. If certain kinds of advertising, such as these two<br />\nkinds, will jeopardize our objectives, then the entire<br />\nHopkins community will lose. The News-Letter is the<br />\nmost effective means of communication in the University, and if it loses some of its effectiveness because of<br />\ncertain advertisements, then everyone would lose. And<br />\nthe blame could be placed on us, the Board of Control.<br />\nWe just don't want that to happen.<br /><br />\n\"Oh<br />\nAt First I Thought<br />\nThat Was Marijuana Smoke !\"<br /><br />\nPfeffer replies to attacks on China dispatch<br />\nThe following column received from<br />\nChina was written by Ric Pfeffer in<br />\ndefense of his dispatch published in the<br />\nNews-Letter on February 29 entitled \"A<br />\nChina of Unprecedented Prosperity.\"<br />\nThe purpose of my dispatch from<br />\nChina was twofold: first, to refute certain<br />\nof the most blatant distortions about<br />\nChinese life that pervaded our mass<br />\nmedia for the last twenty-odd years; and<br />\nsecond, to suggest from what I could tell<br />\nthat the Chinese government, party and<br />\narmy has been striving with substantial<br />\nsuccess to serve its people. If one hopes<br />\nto understand China today, one must<br />\nbegin, I believe, with the reality that<br />\nChina is a decent, if imperfect, society.<br />\nThe facts presented in the article are<br />\nnot in dispute; nor do they appear to be<br />\ncontrovertible. The examples and<br />\nonly too typical\u2014as G.M. Hooks would<br />\nbe the first to note\u2014ofthe more accurate<br />\nreporting on China in our<br /><br />\nmass media<br /><br />\nthat has prevailed since American politics<br />\nrecently reshaped the bounds of what<br />\nconstitutes \"professional reporting\"<br />\nabout the People's Republic.<br />\nThe dispute, I conclude then, must be<br />\nessentially about whether China is a<br />\ndecent society, whether its institutions<br />\ndo in fact tend to \"serve the people.\" Mr.<br />\n(Ms.?) Hooks accuses me of sins of<br />\ncommission, while Mr. Fleischman<br />\naccuses me of sins of omission.<br />\nG.M. Hooks, in the section of his (her)<br />\nletter concerned with my article,<br />\nmaintains first that I have confused<br />\n\"consumerism with political analysis,\"<br />\nand second that what is \"obnoxious\"<br />\nabout my reporting is not its lack of<br />\nobjectivity but \"rather...my puerile desire<br />\nto make China palatable to exactly the<br />\npetit bourgeois tastes that both...I and<br />\nFleischman express.\" For myself, I plead<br />\nguilty to the second count of the<br />\nindictment, but not to the first.<br />\nIt is my belief that a revolution\u2014or,<br />\nfor that matter, the status quo\u2014should be<br />\njudged by how well it serves the people.<br />\nIn my piece I tried to give a few examples<br />\nof ways in which the Chinese government<br />\nhas indeed served its people: by<br />\nextending cooperative health service to<br /><br />\nthe poorest peasants; by obligating cadres<br />\nto seek first hand experience of the<br />\nquality of life of the hundreds of millions<br />\nof peasants, over whose lives they have so<br />\nmuch influence; by substantially raising<br />\nthe material standard of living of its<br />\npopulation etc.<br />\nDoes G.M. Hooks believe a revolution<br />\nshould not raise the material standard of<br />\nliving of its people? Or is it Hooks who<br />\nfails to make elementary distinctions<br />\nbetween providing a standard of living<br />\nabove subsistence and \"consumerism?\"<br />\nSurely what I described can hardly be<br />\ncalled \"consumerism,\" though living in<br />\nAmerica one can understand Hooks'<br />\nnatural oversensitivity to the problem, a<br />\nsensitivity undoubtedly irritated by my<br />\n\"puerile desire\" to cummunicate these<br />\naspects of Chinese life to a largely middle<br />\netas% American audience_ In his pristine<br />\nCIC;f-A77T I3<br /><br />\n\u201c<br />\nITISTarraTC:;- rrorri<br />\n,<br />\n.571.7-C1,11<br /><br />\nimmature concerns.<br />\nAs to the substance<br /><br />\nof Avrom<br /><br />\nFleischman's letter, Fleischman expresses<br />\nhis unassailable concern for \"human<br />\nfreedom\u201d and rebukes me for not having<br />\nreported on this \"intangible.\"<br />\nSpecifically, as self-appointed guardian of<br />\nall that we of the free world hold dear, he<br />\ninquires rhetorically of religious freedom<br />\nin China, of the human side of cadre<br />\nre-education, and of the extent of<br />\nintellectual freedom in China.<br />\nBefore responding specifically, let me<br />\nmake three general points. First, I did not<br />\nfeel it necessary in a 1300 word article to<br />\ndescribe all aspects of Chinese society. I<br />\nchose the limited and relatively easy task<br />\nof rebutting several gross stereotypes, not<br />\nthe more complex task of re-defining<br />\nother, more subtle caricatures of China<br />\nthat hardly need simple repetition.<br />\nSelf-serving descriptions of the<br />\nrestrictions on individual freedom in<br />\nChina have been drilled into the skulls of<br />\nAmericans for over two decades, since<br />\nbirth for most students at Hopkins.<br />\nSecond, I made no claims that China is a<br />\nliberal society; nor is it. I stated that in<br />\nChina \"self and collective discipline<br />\nremain the order of the day,\" that China<br />\nis a \"reasonably highly organized<br />\nsociety.\" And third, while I can<br />\nappreciate Fleischman's attachment to<br /><br />\nhis vision of \"human freedom,\"<br />\nwha\"human\" implies and what is meant<br />\nby \"freedom,\" has been a matter of<br />\ndispute for centuries. Judging by his<br />\nexamples, Fleischman seems by \"human<br />\nfreedom\" to mean the individual's<br />\nfreedom from governmental authority,<br />\nwhat Isiah Berlin has called \"negative<br />\nfreedom.\" But surely historical practice,<br />\nas well as the history of political theory,<br />\nmakes it abundantly clear that such<br />\n\"freedom\" often is in conflict with the<br />\neffective freedom of other individuals<br />\nand with the best interests of the<br />\ncollective, of which the individual is a<br />\npart.<br />\nChina has chosen to emphasize the<br />\ncollective interest, frequently at the<br />\nexpense of individual freedom,at least as<br /><br />\nspoke indicated that he or she felt the<br />\ncadre school had been a very healthy<br />\nexperience. Several said, disarmingly, that<br />\nthey were sorry they hadn't been able to<br />\nstay longer. I believed them. At the two<br />\ncadre schools I visited, the cadres also<br />\nsoomed quite proud of their high degree<br />\nof self-reliance in constructing their own<br />\nbuildings, reclaiming some of their own<br />\nland, cultivating their own crops, etc.<br />\nWith regard to the question of<br />\nintellectual freedom, I do share some of<br />\nthe same values as Mr. Fleischman,<br />\nthough I am much more skeptical than he<br />\nappears to be about the limits and<br />\nsignificance of intellectual freedom in the<br />\nU.S. But, more than that, it should be<br />\nunderstood that intellectual freedom in<br />\npractice is largely the property of the<br /><br />\nRamblers. later on his own. Those who<br />\nsaw him in his two appearances here last<br />\nfall will remember him amidst a stage full<br />\nof instruments (he plays seven on the<br />\nalbum), relaxed and informal, proving by<br />\nexample that the function of music is to<br />\nproduce delight.<br />\nThe next best thing to a Mike Seeger<br />\nconcert is a Mike Seeger album. and his<br />\nlatest effort should disappoint no one.<br />\nThe material varies greatly\u2014ranging from<br />\na ballad obviously derived from England<br />\n.t o a commentary (both topical and<br />\nnonsensical) on the Nashville of the early<br />\n1930's.

They recorded for<br />\nsuch companies as Arhoolie, Decca, and<br />\nVocalion\u2014labels which were also among<br />\nthe first to issue recordings of the early<br />\nblack bluesmen.<br />\nMany of the songs these minstrels sang<br />\nwere culled directly from the folk<br />\ntradition of the Southeast; others were<br />\nwritten by the musicians\u2014the product of<br />\ntheir encounter with other folk<br />\nforms\u2014notably the blues.

One of his press<br />\nreleases emphasizes: \"Designed to<br />\nprovide important new services to the<br />\nfilm world, the USA-International<br />\nAnimation Film Festival will not be<br />\nanother cumbersome addition to the<br />\nalready bulging valise that epitomizes<br />\ntoday's film festival scene.\"<br />\nThis is not to say that the IAFF will<br />\nonly be a marketplace; an international<br />\njury composed of representatives from<br />\ntelevision, the press, and the animated<br />\nfilm industry itself (including a<br />\n12-year-old boy,) will award prizes to the<br />\nbest films in each category.

Mintz is a relative newcomer to<br />\nthe film festival scene, having attempted<br />\nit only once before, with the First (and<br />\nlast) Annual Rochester International<br />\nFilm Festival. The problem in Rochester,<br />\nN.Y., was the existence of a certain<br />\nindustry, connected intimately with the<br />\nfilm business, who wanted to have the<br />\nRochester film festival very much under<br />\ntheir control, attempting to emasculate<br />\nthe festival by removing the controversial<br />\nfilms. With the refusal of censorship by<br />\nthe planners, the artistic success of the<br />\nfestival was insured, but the financial<br />\naspects took a slight downturn.<br />\nWith this second try, which is certainly<br />\nmore innovative and potentially<br />\nprofitable, Mintz stands an excellent<br />\nchance of holding a very successful film<br />\nfestival, making some money in the<br />\nprocess, and giving a tremendous boost to<br />\nthe cartoon facet of film-making.<br /><br />\npage '10/n.ews-ietter/april 7, 1972<br /><br />\nMonument rises over quaint square<br />\nBy ROBERT PAULUS<br />\nMost residents of Baltimore<br />\nare familiar with the Washington<br />\nMonument towering above<br />\nquaint Mount Vernon Place, but<br />\nfew people outside of a handful<br />\nof tourists, small children and<br />\nhistory buffs ever bother to<br />\nclimb its 228 steps.<br />\nBuilt upon a small hill in the<br />\nmiddle of Charles Street at<br /><br />\nMonument Street, the<br />\nWashington Monument is located<br />\nin one of the historical and<br />\ncultural centers of Baltimore.<br />\nCobblestone and brick still pave<br />\nthe streets encircling the<br />\nMonument and the surrounding<br />\narea.

Ehrlichman, Assistant<br />\nto the President for Domestic<br />\nAffairs, was the guest speaker at<br />\nthe Milford H. Whitehill<br />\nLeadership Seminar Wednesday<br />\nafternoon in the library's Garrett<br />\nRoom.<br />\nSpeaking to a group of<br />\nspecially invited student leaders<br />\nand members of the faculty and<br />\nadministration, Ehrlichman<br />\noutlined some of the main<br />\ndomestic problems he saw facing<br />\nthe country and urged patience<br />\nin finding their appropriate<br />\nsolutions. The four main areas he<br />\nnoted were taxation, the conflict<br />\nbetween energy and the<br />\nenvironment, responsiveness of<br />\ngovernment, and the<br />\nmaldistribution of our<br />\npopulation.<br />\n\"We have a critical mismatch<br />\nof responsibilities and revenues in<br />\nour federal government,\" noted<br />\nEhrlichman with regard to our<br />\ntax structure. He called for tax<br />\nreform which would. promote<br /><br />\n\"equity of application, equity in<br />\nlevy, practical linkage between<br />\nlevels of government, practical<br />\nlimits on what you can tax, and<br />\nsimplicity.\"<br />\nHorse and Buggy<br />\n\"While at the federal level we<br />\nhave a highly desirable revenue<br />\nsystem,\" Ehrlichman remarked,<br />\n\"the states and localities have<br />\nhad to resort to horse and buggy<br />\ntaxes.\" He claimed this resulted<br />\nfrom the federal government's<br />\nhaving the money while the<br />\nlocalities have been carrying the<br />\nincreasing burden of problems.<br />\nHe saw revenue-sharing as a<br />\ntemporary measure to funnel<br />\nresponsibilities and funds back to<br />\nthe local governments.<br />\nObserving recent talk about<br />\ntax loopholes, the President's<br />\nassistant called for a re-evaluation<br />\nof why certain deductions and<br />\nloopholes were instituted in the<br />\nfirst place.<br />\nCongress, in Ehrlichman's<br />\nview, presents the chief obstacle<br />\nto a simplification of the tax<br /><br />\nstructure. \"Inertia runs against<br />\nchange, and Congressmen are<br />\nresponsive to that inertia,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nEnergy<br />\nEhrlichman pinpointed the<br />\nconflict between the need for<br />\ngreater energy and the desire to<br />\npreserve the environment. \"Even<br />\nif our production of energy<br />\ncontinues on its upward curve,<br />\nwe will still face a shortage in<br />\nseven years,\" he observed.
