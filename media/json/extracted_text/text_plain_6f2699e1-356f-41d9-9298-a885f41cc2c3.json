In 1985 and 1986,<br />\nthe first attempts at gun legislation were<br />\nsubmitted to the House Judiciary committee, on which he serves.<br />\n<br />\n\"A gun law cannot just call for the<br />\nelimination of all Saturday Night<br />\nSpecials,\" said Montague. Many of the<br />\nbills submitted, however, lacked specifics<br />\nand called for a general ban.\"A law must<br />\nbe specific,\" he said.<br />\nHe then explained his unique approach<br />\nto the formulation of the Maryland Handgun Law. He took Federal Bureau of<br />\nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms legislation, which ban the importation of low<br />\nquality handguns from overseas, and applied them to Saturday Night Specials in<br />\nMaryland.<br />\n\"A Saturday Night Special is a weapon<br />\nnot useful for any legitimate sporting or<br />\n<br />\ndefensive purpose,\" he said. \"It is a gun<br />\nthat has certain physical criteria. It is<br />\ncheaply made and has poor ballistic<br />\nability.\"<br />\nThe Bureau legislation bans this type of<br />\nfirearm, and the Maryland Gun Law contains much of the same language contained therein. In the original draft of the bill,<br />\na provision appointed the police<br />\nsuperintendent to decide whether a handgun fits the criteria for Saturday Night<br />\nSpecials, said Montague.<br />\nThe NRA, which was represented in the<br />\nbill making process, objected to the apSee HANDGUNS, 3<br />\n<br />\n\f2/OCTOBER 7, 1988<br />\n<br />\nUndergrads<br />\nrelax, revel<br />\nat Fall Fest<br />\nby Anthony Tassi<br />\nThey came to Homewood from<br />\nall walks of life.

Your<br />\nalarm clock has just jarred you<br />\nfrom a deep dream in which you<br />\nwere on balmy beach somewhere<br />\nfar away from Baltimore, and the<br />\nreality of a rainy morning hits<br />\nhard. You grab a towel and shuffle down the hallway of your<br />\napartment, stepping around the<br />\nsticky spots on the living room<br />\nfloor, and open the bathroom<br />\ndoor.<br />\nAt first your Morning Stupids<br />\nseem to blame. Your ceiling is in<br />\nthe bathtub and all over the<br />\nfloor...but if it's on the floor then<br />\nit should be the floor because ceilings are supposed to be above<br />\nyour head..,no, it is definitely on<br />\nthe floor, and it is definitely not<br />\nthe floor you had yesterday. You<br />\nstare a little longer. It is unquestionably your ceiling, piled up in<br />\nchunks of plaster, rusted steel<br />\nplate, odd brown greasy stuff and<br />\npipes. Underneath it all is the<br />\nlowered ceiling which you had<br />\nthought kind of fishy when you<br />\nmoved in since none of the other<br />\napartments in the building had<br />\nlowered ceilings. In fact, you had<br />\nnever seen a bathroom with a<br />\nlowered ceiling.

You invite your<br />\nmanager, who does not seem to<br />\nhave any idea who the hell you<br />\n<br />\nare, to stick his hand into the grab<br />\nbag and give your ceiling a good<br />\nfeel. He declines.<br />\n\"Who the hell are you?\" he<br />\nasks.<br />\nYou explain. He looks at you<br />\ndisbelievingly. You demand a<br />\nnew ceiling. Now. You say you<br />\nwon't pay rent until it is done. He<br />\ntells you not to threaten him. You<br />\ntry to explain that if his ceiling<br />\nwas communing with his bathtub,<br />\nhe would be upset,too. He tells<br />\nyou someone will be up to look<br />\nat it immediately.<br />\nThree days later, with the exception of a maintenance man<br />\nwho came in and laughed,<br />\nnothing has happened. You call<br />\nyour father, who is known in the<br />\nrestaurant and airline industries<br />\nfor his use of sheer terror to get<br />\nservice, and ask him to put the<br />\nfear of God into management. He<br />\nevidently does so, because a few<br />\nminutes later three maintenance<br />\nmen come to the apartment, stare<br />\nup at what used to be your<br />\nbathroom celiling, and laugh.<br />\nThey laugh a lot. After noting that<br />\nyour ceiling has fallen in and that<br />\nthe floor above you is visible,<br />\nthey leave. You can hear them<br />\nlaughing as they walk down the<br />\nhallway. So much for the fear of<br />\nGod.<br />\nOver the next several weeks,<br />\nthe building finds that the water<br />\nleakage which has caused your<br />\nproblem is part of a bigger picture which affects three floors t<br />\nabove you and two below.

What I want to hear is<br />\npassion and emotion, and technique figures in only when I feel<br />\nan artist isn't capable of expressing<br />\nhimself.<br />\nAll of which has a lot to do with<br />\nwhy one of the first \"punk\"<br />\nbands I ever got into was Midnight Oil. On any given Oils<br />\nalbum there's enough passion<br />\nthere for three other bands<br />\nbesides. So when I went to hear<br />\nthe Oils play at Towson State<br />\nTuesday night, I was expecting<br />\n<br />\nlots of passion\u2014after all, I had<br />\nnever seen a concert photo of lead<br />\nsinger Peter Garrett that didn't<br />\nmake him look like an absolute<br />\nmaniac.<br />\nAccording to Garrett, the Oils<br />\ndecided to play a small venue like<br />\nTowson because they wanted to<br />\nperform \"in a moderate place for<br />\nmoderate people.\" There was<br />\nnothing moderate about their<br />\nperformance.<br />\nSome bands take a few songs<br />\nto get up to speed. With the Oils,<br />\nyou have instant velocity. From<br />\nthe opening tune of\"Read About<br />\nIt\" it was obvious that we were<br />\nin for a high energy evening.<br />\nHigh energy, in fact, seems a bit<br />\n<br />\ninadequate to describe what these<br />\nguys do. With his jerky dancing<br />\nmotions Garrett resembles an<br />\nautomaton gone out of control,<br />\nhis battery pack having discharged all at once and filling him with<br />\nenergy that threatens to rip him<br />\napart. When the Oils rock, it's<br />\nlike a fusion reactor gone out of<br />\ncontrol, and when they're really<br />\ninto it...well, metaphors fail me,<br />\nbut images of tightly controlled<br />\nexplosions come to mind.<br />\nNot that the Oils aren't also<br />\ncapable of putting on the soft<br />\npedal. One of the shows's<br />\nhighlights was a haunting, urgent<br />\nversion of \"Sherman's Boxers\"<br />\nthat made the hairs on my neck<br />\n<br />\nOnMedia: The Media Bowl<br />\nby T.H. Kern<br />\nA month remains before the<br />\npresidential election takes place<br />\non November 8. But a serious<br />\nproblem remains, as well: the<br />\nforces of the media are covering<br />\nthe 1988 election campaign with<br />\nan unprecedented hunger for fluff<br />\nissues and political belly-button<br />\nlint. What began as a campaign<br />\nwith tangible issues has mutated<br />\ninto little more than an amateur<br />\nhour at a comedy club. Sure<br />\nenough, each of the presidential<br />\ncandidates labors every day to<br />\nmake his opponent look like an<br />\namateur. This is not done by<br />\ndiscussing political issues, but<br />\nwith peppy one-liners and photo<br />\nopportunities. \"Comedy\" is an<br />\naccurate description.<br />\nThe first of the two presidential debates brought this labor of<br />\nloopiness to its logical conclusion. The 90-minute program<br />\npresented each of the candidates<br />\nwith a number of serious questions about the future of the<br />\nUnited States, but few real solutions were offered by either of the<br />\nmen who would be president. Instead, the now-traditional vague<br />\npromises to \"make America<br />\ngreat\" and \"lower that deficit\"<br />\nabounded in a sea of sarcastic<br />\nremarks and\u2014you guessed it\u2014<br />\nmore one-liners. Public interest,<br />\nreports show, was unusually low,<br />\nand dissatisfaction with the candidates' answers considerable.<br />\nBut the candidates aren't the only ones at fault. The media has<br />\nextinguished the issues for better ratings, and America is paying the price.<br />\nBy most accounts, the undecided American voters\u2014comprising<br />\na staggering 33 percent of the<br />\nelectorate\u2014are fed up with the<br />\nbrainlessness of the campaign and<br />\nthe blandness of the candidates'<br />\npositions on key issues. But the<br />\nissues weren't always as vapid as<br />\nthey now are. In the two months<br />\npreceding the party conventions<br />\nin late July and early August,<br />\nvoter poll results varied wildly<br />\nfrom week to week. In part, this<br />\nwas a function of levity; it was<br />\nearly and few voters had fierce<br />\nloyalties to either candidate. At<br />\nthe same time, however, issues<br />\n<br />\nwere being directly addressed and<br />\nfaithfully reported\u2014the network<br />\nnews was much more apt to show<br />\na clip of a candidate disussing<br />\nplatform views than of him insulting his rivals. The newspapers<br />\nwere equally intelligent. Columnists zealously brought issues into the light for the candidates to<br />\naddress, then reproached them if<br />\nthey failed to do so. Politically<br />\nspeaking, there was an issue on<br />\nevery channel. Candidates had to<br />\nearn their support the hard way.<br />\nThat isn't so anymore. Since<br />\nGeorge Bush made the surprising<br />\nchoice of Indiana Senator Dan<br />\nQuayle for his running mate, the<br />\nomnicient media has transformed<br />\nthe campaign into a mud-slinging<br />\ncircus. The first glob was flung<br />\nby the media concerning Quayle's<br />\nduty in the Indiana National<br />\nGuard, which he was rumored to<br />\nhave assumed via connections to<br />\navoid active duty in Viet Nam.<br />\nThe media, already stumped by<br />\nBush's motives for choosing<br />\nQuayle, zeroed in with I.H1precedented force for two weeks,<br />\noverturning every stone in<br />\nQuayle's past while ignoring both<br />\nhis questionable academic record<br />\nand his work in the Senate. Thus<br />\nbegan what columnist William<br />\nRaspberry has dubbed, \"The<br />\nCampaign As Soap Opera.\"<br />\nThis episode has set the pace<br />\nfor the campaign ever since.<br />\nWhat used to be a forum for<br />\ndebate is now a bathroom wall for<br />\npolitical graffiti; the candidates<br />\ndon't expound on their strengths<br />\nnearly as often as their opponents'<br />\nflaws in character, patriotism,<br />\nor\u2014occasionally\u2014ability.<br />\nSomehow, the press has put<br />\nthe entire campaign on the defensive; down and dirty has been the<br />\ntone of the candidates' speeches,<br />\nbland and benevolent their solutions to problems both present<br />\nand future. They both seem afraid<br />\nto take a stand by the issues,<br />\nclinging instead to the ideas that<br />\nnow make American politics<br />\ngreat: media exposure of dirt<br />\nfrom a candidate's past; media<br />\nallowing the candidates to speak<br />\nbefore purple mountain majesties;<br />\nmedia spurring the frantic campaigns to send candidates into<br />\nBoston Harbor for boat rides.<br />\nMedia technology, in all its<br />\n<br />\nforms, has long occupied a<br />\nsignificant place in American<br />\npolitics. But only this year does<br />\nits influence seem so great as to<br />\ncompletely dominate the campaign, for its priorities have all<br />\nbut left substance for dead,<br />\nreplacing it with \"entertainment\"<br />\ncoverage. The public was charmed by this concept briefly, but as<br />\nthe status in opinion polls (yet<br />\nanother arm of the establishment)<br />\nindicates, America has had it with<br />\nthis particular soap opera. The<br />\nquestion is no longer rhetorical:<br />\nShouldn't Presidential campaigns<br />\nhave a little more pith than this?<br />\nThe now-tired complaint about<br />\nthe campaign having no issues is<br />\nridiculous; the issues are not absent, they're being ignored.<br />\nWhere have they gone? Ask the<br />\npeople in the different campaigns\u2014because, by my estimate,<br />\nthere are at least three going on<br />\nright now.<br />\nThe first campaign is the<br />\npseudo-platform campaign: the<br />\ncandidates make their daily appearances, ideally hammering<br />\nhome both their message of peace<br />\nand prosperity and some specifics<br />\nas to how to achieve it. Lately,<br />\nthough, it consists of clever<br />\nresponses to opponent's attacks of.<br />\npersonality. This campaign is<br />\n\"pseudo-\" because party platforms have been eroded by a<br />\nstorm of crowd-pleasing<br />\nimprovisations.<br />\nThe second campaign is Big<br />\nBrother Media's campaign: nightly news spots, front-page<br />\ncoverage of the day's one-liners,<br />\nnewspaper distillations of \"the<br />\ncampaign today,\" and so on.<br />\nThis campaign exerts tremendous<br />\nforce over the other campaigns,<br />\nbut it is not (as many have suggested) the whole story.<br />\nThe third campaign is run by<br />\ncolumnists and editorial writers,<br />\na group less bound to objectivity<br />\nthan the rest of the \"news\"<br />\nmedia. More often than not, it<br />\nbrings to light the issues which<br />\nhave been carefully buried by the<br />\nrest of the media and, therefore,<br />\nthe candidates.

Three songs<br />\ninto the set Garrett announced that<br />\nthey were going \"to do the television song and get it over with,\"<br />\nwhereupon they launched into<br />\n\"Beds are Burning.\" By my<br />\ncount, not including encores, the<br />\nOils only played four other songs<br />\noff the new album, dedicating the<br />\nrest of the show to both older and<br />\nbrand new material. Best of all,<br />\nthe audience wasn't subjected to<br />\na rehash of album versions of the<br />\n<br />\nold material. Whether it was a<br />\nguitar break, an extended instrumental section, or simply different instrumentation, the Oils<br />\nattempted to give their audience<br />\nsomething new and interesting<br />\nwith each song. Such respect for<br />\none's fans is refreshing in a day<br />\nand age where many performers<br />\nseem to regard their audience as<br />\na necessary evil to be tolerated for<br />\nas short a period of time as<br />\npossible.<br />\nFinally, though the Oils are a<br />\nband known for their political<br />\nstance, they did a marvellous job<br />\nof keeping the polemics to a<br />\nminimum. The Oils see their purpose as being to both inform and<br />\nentertain, and prefer to let their<br />\nact speak for them, as it should.<br />\nI recently read an article by someone who ridiculed Amnesty<br />\nInternational for putting on a rock<br />\nconcert that made them seem<br />\nfrivolous, and accomplished<br />\nnothing. Maybe if the author of<br />\nthat article spent two hours at a<br />\nMidnight Oil concert, he'd<br />\nunderstand how music can communicate a wealth of feeling and<br />\nemotion that mere words and<br />\nrhetoric could never approach.<br />\n<br />\nHis Masters' Voice<br />\nby T.H. Kern<br />\nCredit Branford Marsalis for<br />\nfollowing his own Muse. For<br />\nwhile critics have been clamoring<br />\nfor him to quit hedging and<br />\ndevelop his own style of playing,<br />\nhe has been forging one with both<br />\noriginality and the unmistakable<br />\nechoes of his saxophone elders.<br />\nIt's undeniable that Ben Webster,<br />\nJohn Coltrane, Sonny Rollins,<br />\nand especially Wayne Shorter can<br />\nbe heard in his playing. But the<br />\nunique voices of these saxophone<br />\ngiants\u2014influences for any saxophone<br />\nplayer<br />\nof<br />\nhis<br />\ngeneration\u2014are no crutch for the<br />\n28 year old Marsalis. Instead,<br />\nthey have provided him with a<br />\nsophisticated<br />\nemotional<br />\nvocabulary for his improvisational work. This is nothing<br />\nespecially new; it's been brewing<br />\nfor years. But on his new \"Random Abstract' (Columbia 44055;<br />\nLP, CD, and cassette) the<br />\nburgeoning young saxophone<br />\nplayer, with the aid of a crack<br />\nrhythm section and a variegated<br />\nset of compositions, has reached<br />\na new level of lucidity and<br />\ncommand.<br />\nEven in the first bars of<br />\nShorter's \"Yes and No,\" the<br />\nrecord's first track, Marsalis<br />\nmakes it clear that he is playing<br />\nwith a new level of authority. The<br />\nfluidity of his swing is intense,<br />\nbut seems effortless. His leap<br />\nfrom the main melody into a dizzying improvisation is logical and<br />\nimplacable; it's almost impossible not to tap your feet along with<br />\nthe buoyancy of his phrasing. The<br />\nrhythm section\u2014pianist Kenny<br />\nKirkland, bassist Delbert Felix,<br />\nand drummer Lewis Nash\u2014play<br />\nwith furious accuracy, but usher<br />\nin sly shifts in dynamics between<br />\nthe \"yes\" and \"no\" sections of<br />\nthe tune, adding emotional<br />\n<br />\ndimensions to the melody that<br />\nShorter's original had only suggested. Nash's timekeeping is<br />\nsure and deadly, and it meshes<br />\nwell with Kirkland's jaggedly<br />\npercussive piano solo.<br />\nMuch of the appeal of \"Random Abstract\" lies in the two<br />\nlevels of virtuosity operating<br />\nthroughout the album. For on one<br />\nhand, this quartet works almost<br />\nseamlessly as a unit.(At the time<br />\nof the recording, they had been<br />\nplaying together for roughly a<br />\nyear and a halt). But on the other<br />\nhand, Marsalis and the rhythm<br />\nsection each function so well individually that it's often tempting<br />\nto pry them apart for pleasure's<br />\nsake. Although \"Yes and No\"<br />\nbenefits tremendously from such<br />\ndissection, further such interplay<br />\ncan be found on \"Crescent City\"(Kirkland's lengthy solo is set<br />\nin an ideal piano trio format) and<br />\n\"I Thought About You,\" Marsalis' purported farewell to his<br />\nBen Webster emulation. His<br />\nrestless tenor reading of Ornette<br />\nColeman's \"Lonely Woman\"<br />\nmolds so well with the rest of the<br />\nband that the listener has to all but<br />\npeel apart the fine layers of<br />\ninstrumentation.<br />\nNot all of\"Random Abstract\"<br />\nruns so smoothly. Both \"Broadway Fools\" and the sinewy<br />\n\"LonJellis\" seem unnecessarily<br />\ndisjointed. The latter is largely a<br />\nvehicle for Nash, whose<br />\nimpressive\u2014and<br />\npoorly<br />\nrecorded\u2014drum work deserves a<br />\nbetter showcase. \"Broadway<br />\nFools\" finds Marsalis skittering<br />\nthrough a disarming soprano<br />\nsolo, and Kirkland's piano figures<br />\nare humorous in kind, but less<br />\nthan satisfying. Felix's bass line<br />\noffers the most enjoyable aspect<br />\nof the piece: sure and unhurried,<br />\nSee FLIPSIDE, 15<br />\n<br />\n\fN EWS-LETTER/15<br />\nTimes are<br />\nrespectively.<br />\n<br />\nARTSCAL<br />\nFILM<br />\nWeekend<br />\nThis<br />\nweek<br />\nWonderflix presents The Princess<br />\nBride in Shriver Hall, Friday and<br />\nSaturday at 8 and 10:15.

His<br />\nstrutting line in \"Crescent City\"<br />\npropels the piece forward with<br />\nflair, and his delicate work on \"I<br />\nThought About You\" offers a<br />\nwelcome contrast to Kirkland's<br />\ncrisp piano figures.<br />\nThe Kern-Harbach standard<br />\n\"Yesterdays\" makes clear the<br />\nastonishing steps Marsalis' ballad<br />\n<br />\nhis secret<br />\nplaying\u2014long<br />\nweapon\u2014have taken in less than<br />\na year.

Apparently, as the statistics<br />\nsuggest, the answer is often no.<br />\nThis decision may stem from a<br />\nnumber of things. Recently much<br />\npublicity has centered around the<br />\ninterference of the practice of<br />\nmedicine by other people. At one<br />\ntime, the physician was thought<br />\nto be his own boss, but now commonly the doctor must work<br />\nunder the supervision of other<br />\npeople or corporations. The intrusion of government and the role<br />\nof insurance agcncies have also<br />\nturned many away from this<br />\nprofession.<br />\nA more practical reason affecting a student's decision is cost.<br />\nTypically the medical student<br />\nleaves his or her institution with<br />\na forty to fifty thousand dollar<br />\nloan, a tremendous burden to saddle. Obviously the bad publicity<br />\nabout malpractice, fear of AIDS,<br />\nand the prediction of an oversupply of physicians in the near<br />\nfuture also has led to a national<br />\ndecline in this field.<br />\nIf the above rhetoric has not<br />\ndeterred you, perhaps a consoling note is that the total number<br />\nof Hopkins pre-meds has not<br />\nreflected this decline. What ad-<br />\n<br />\nvice can then be given to the naive<br />\npre-med student? Dr. Gryder has<br />\nstressed that deciding to be a doctor is by no means a limiting experience. The medical field provides a vast array of interests,<br />\nanywhere from being a pediatrician to acting as a consultant on<br />\ninternational health. One must investigate the advantages and<br />\ndisadvantages of a given health<br />\ncareer and let his or her natural<br />\ninclination provide the guidance.<br />\nThe undergraduate's chosen major should reflect what the individual finds interesting. Again<br />\na science field may not necessarily be more useful in a medical<br />\nsetting.<br />\nMedical applications often<br />\nplace an emphasis on grades and<br />\nMedical College Admissions\"<br />\nTests (MCAT). These, Dr.<br />\nGryder feels, get the student<br />\nthrough \"the door\" or initial cut.<br />\nThe most important criteria seem<br />\nto be the interview and extracurricular activities\u2014how the individual spends his time when not<br />\nstudying. This is not just a matter of listing a series of clubs but<br />\nrather a documentation of what<br />\none has done while at the university. Research, for some individuals, may be a form of extracurricular involvement; for<br />\nothers, the playing of varsity<br />\nsports or writing articles in student journals may fill this<br />\ncategory. But despite any of these<br />\ncredentials\u2014grades, scores, or<br />\nschool activities, the interview<br />\nmay determine admission to a<br />\ngiven medical institution.

According to a recent<br />\nGallup Poll, to a majority of<br />\nAmericans today, Hopkins means<br />\nmedicine.<br />\nTo celebrate the Centennial,<br />\nJohns Hopkins is planning an array of activities. The major<br />\nevents will take place June 7-11,<br />\n1989, with scientific Symposia,<br />\nthe unveiling of a U.S. postage<br />\nstamp honoring Mr. Johns<br />\nHopkins, an art exhibit featuring<br />\nmedical masterpieces, gala concerts, and fireworks.<br />\nThe record of the 1,000-bed<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital, the<br />\nSchool of Medicine, School of<br />\nNursing and the nation's oldest<br />\n<br />\nand largest School of Public<br />\nHealth stems directly from their<br />\nfounder's determination to seek<br />\nnew knowledge rather than rely<br />\non accepted wisdom. Hopkins<br />\nwas the first medical center where<br />\nteaching, research and patient<br />\ncare were truly integrated. So<br />\ngreat was the power and productivity of this tripartite union that<br />\nit gave rise to a new era of scientific medicine.<br />\nAs a result, Hopkins had an important role in the development of<br />\nmajor subspecialties, from<br />\npediatrics and urology to<br />\nneurosurgery and medical<br />\ngenetics. Hopkins surgeons were<br />\nthe first to use rubber gloves, and<br />\nHopkins scientists discovered<br />\nadrenalin and heparin, purified<br />\ndiscovered<br />\nand<br />\ninsulin,<br />\nDramamine's effectiveness<br />\nagainst motion sickness.<br />\nThey developed the Blue Baby<br />\noperation that ushered in the era<br />\nof modern heart surgery, found<br />\nkeys to controlling the most common forms of blindness,<br />\ndeveloped life-saving CPR and<br />\ntissue culture, earned a Nobel<br />\nprize for the discovery of restriction enzymes (the chemical<br />\nknives that cut genes), uncovered<br />\nopiate receptors and pioneered in<br />\nnew directions in brain<br />\n<br />\nchemistry, drug development and<br />\nbiological psychiatry.<br />\nHopkins public health investigators spread water chlorination throughout the world, identified the three types of polio<br />\nvirus, discovered vitamin D and<br />\nB complex, and altered the eating<br />\nhabits of the American public.<br />\nThe Hospital that opened its<br />\ndoors on May 7, 1889, was the<br />\nlegacy of Johns Hopkins, a visionary Quaker and Baltimore<br />\nmerchant who bequeathed $7<br />\nmillion to found a new-style<br />\nuniversity and hospital. The<br />\nstipulations in his will and in a letter of instruction to his trustees<br />\nspelled out a unique relationsip<br />\nbetween the Hospital and the<br />\nUniversity's School of Medicine<br />\nthat created a national model for<br />\nmodern medical education and<br />\npatient care.<br />\nBefore his death on Christmas<br />\nEve 1873, at the age of 78,<br />\nHopkins purchased 13 acres in<br />\nEast Baltimore and gave it to his<br />\ntrustees with a detailed letter that<br />\nspecified that care in his hospital<br />\nwas to be given \"without regard<br />\nto sex, age, or color.\" The<br />\nHospital that was constructed on<br />\nthe site included buildings designed as monuments to the city.<br />\nSeveral remain in use and are<br />\n<br />\nlisted on the National Register of<br />\nHistoric Places. They represent<br />\nthe first attempt at a germcontrolled environment.<br />\nA century ago, most patients<br />\nwere treated in their homes, and<br />\nhospitals were asylums for the<br />\npoor. Those who did come into<br />\nthe hospital frequently died after<br />\nsurgery. Operations were performed on open wards, and<br />\nphysicians' \"training\" was<br />\ngenerally limited to a few months<br />\nof formal lectures. Schools of<br />\nmedicine usually were not linked<br />\nto hospital settings, and physicians could go out into practice<br />\nwithout ever having laid a hand<br />\non a patient.<br />\nThe Hopkins Hospital and<br />\nSchool of Medicine changed all<br />\nthat. Hopkins required the training of physicians at a graduate<br />\nlevel\u2014a baccalaureate was<br />\nnecessary for admisision to the<br />\nSchool of Medicine\u2014with rigid<br />\nentrance requirements in the basic<br />\nsciences. The incorporation of a<br />\nhospital as the training ground for<br />\ndoctors, careful bedside learning<br />\nas part of the educational process,<br />\nthe extension of medical education through postgraduate<br />\nresidencies and fellowships, the<br />\nemphasis on research as well as<br />\ndelivery of patient care, the in-<br />\n<br />\ntroduction of full-time salaried<br />\nscientist-physicians, and the acceptance of women students as<br />\nthe equals of men were among the<br />\nradical changes that owe their existence to the Hopkins School of<br />\nMedicine.<br />\nHopkins gathered its early<br />\nfaculty from the finest talents in<br />\nthe nation, many of them<br />\nEuropean-trained, and gave them<br />\njoint appointments at the Hopital<br />\nand University. The influence of<br />\nthese founding physicians\u2014<br />\nWelch, Osier, Halsted and<br />\nKelly\u2014trained a generation who<br />\nspread the Hopkins standards to<br />\nother medical institutions across<br />\nAmerica.

Despite recent losses<br />\nto Washington and Goucher Colleges, the team has demonstrated<br />\na lot of potential and strength by<br />\ndecisively beating their opponents<br />\nstatistically despite suffering<br />\nlosses when the points were<br />\ntotalled.<br />\nHopkins' loss to Washington<br />\ncame after a long five game<br />\nmatch, played instead of the usual<br />\nthree game match due to both<br />\nteams' presence in the MAC. The<br />\nLady Jays won the first two<br />\ngames but dropped the final<br />\nthree, the fifth resulting in a<br />\n14-16 heartbreaker. After this tiring bout with Washington, the<br />\n<br />\nLady Jays couldn't come up with<br />\nenough strength to defeat an inferior Goucher squad, resulting in<br />\na 13-15, 12-15 loss to the<br />\nGophers.

During both halves<br />\nof regulation time and the overtime period, the Hooters<br />\ndominated the game in the air and<br />\non the ground. In the air, 6'5\"<br />\n<br />\nGeoff Manning was unbeatable<br />\non head balls while, the passing<br />\ngame was excellent as all players<br />\non the field were moving and<br />\ncommunicating consistently. This<br />\ntired out the Ursinus squad and<br />\ncreated holes for easy passes.<br />\nFinishing shots off, however,<br />\nhas been very hard lately. Some<br />\nshots have been missing the goal<br />\nby mere inches while other shots<br />\n<br />\nCraig Weinstein battles past the opposing goalie.<br />\n<br />\nFile photo<br />\n<br />\nthat appear to be going in are<br />\ndeflected or saved by the opposing team. That was the story Friday night.<br />\nAt one practice, Coach Haus<br />\nhad the team working on finishing<br />\noff their shots for over an hour.<br />\nHowever, this lack of scoring is<br />\nmental and not physical. There is<br />\nno more pressure of having to<br />\nwin every game and new players<br />\nwill be more relaxed as they go<br />\ninto games.<br />\nThe next game took place at<br />\nSalisbury on Monday, October 3.<br />\nThis game was exactly like the<br />\nUrsinus game: the Hooters<br />\ndominated every aspect of the<br />\ngame but couldn't score. That<br />\nchanged in the final two minutes<br />\nof the game as Geoff Manning<br />\nflew through to head Jim McKiernan's corner kick past Salisbury<br />\nkeeper.<br />\nThe 1-0 win meant a lot to the<br />\nteam. It was their first road victory and more importantly, it<br />\nshowed that if they play the way<br />\nthey are capable of playing for<br />\nninty minutes, they'll win.<br />\nThe defense played very well<br />\nas the No-Goal Patrol was in control. Again, Manning was<br />\nsuperior in the air. Jeff Cadeddu<br />\nwas also excellent in the air. On<br />\nthe ground, it seemed that Eric<br />\nLindenbaum never lost a tackle.<br />\nHe consistently got a piece of<br />\nevery ball.

Pocchia<br />\nAlthough the Hopkins football<br />\nteam began its season with a<br />\nshaky start, certain players have<br />\nconsistently contributed a high<br />\nlevel of performance that the final<br />\nscores do not show. One of those<br />\nplayers is co-captain Brian Dulin.<br />\nDulin, now in his senior year<br />\nat Hopkins, has been a starting<br />\nrunning back since his freshman<br />\nyear. By the end of his junior<br />\nyear, the 5'7\", 175 lb. Blue Jay<br />\nfrom Philadelphia had already<br />\nfound himself seventh on the alltime Hopkins statistics list for<br />\ntotal career rushing yardage. Last<br />\nseason alone, Dulin had 136 carries for 462 yards, an average of<br />\n42.6 yards per game. His receiving percentages are also impressive: he caught 10 passes for<br />\n174 yards and led the Jays with<br />\nseven touchdown receptions.<br />\nIn preparation for his senior<br />\nyear, it was important to Dulin,<br />\nnow that he was going to be a cocaptain, to work even harder for<br />\nthe team. He spent his summer<br />\nlifeguarding on a beach in Stone<br />\nHarbor, New Jersey, and the job<br />\ngave him the time and the<br />\nfacilities to increase his speed,<br />\n<br />\nstrength, and endurance.<br />\nHis hard work appears to have<br />\npaid off, for in his first four<br />\ngames this season, Dulin has run<br />\nfor 217 yards on 48 carries, giving him a total of 1,410 yards<br />\nrushing in his career at Hopkins.<br />\nThis places him sixth on the JHU<br />\nall-time leading rushing list.<br />\nStatistics and records are,<br />\nhowever, unimportant to Dulin.<br />\nAsked about his chances of moving into the number five spot,<br />\nDulin replied that he would rather<br />\ntrade all his yardage and personal<br />\ngains for wins for the good of the<br />\nteam.<br />\nDulin, along with the rest of the<br />\nBlue Jays, will have a chance to<br />\ngo after the first win this Saturday against Ursinus. According<br />\nto Dulin, the team has been working very hard this week to prepare<br />\nfor the game. The wishbone offense will be abandoned and, as<br />\na result, a more diversified offense will be utilized.<br />\nThe team is treating this game<br />\nas if it were the first game of the<br />\nseason. Dulin said, \"Ursinus will<br />\nbe our starting point to pick<br />\nourselves up. Everyone has a<br />\ngood attitude, and we are ready<br />\nto start winning.\"<br />\n<br />\nCoach leads the way<br />\nin GMU Invitational<br />\nby Coleen Furey<br />\nThe women's cross country<br />\nteam competed in the George<br />\nMason Invitational last Saturday<br />\nagainst some very strong teams.<br />\nThe Blue Jays finished ninth out<br />\nof eleven schools but showed<br />\nindividual<br />\nsome<br />\nsolid<br />\nperformances.<br />\nSuzi McGinn was once again<br />\nthe first finisher for Hopkins with<br />\nan excellent time of 18:59.

Many of the<br />\nbills submitted, however, lacked specifics<br />\nand called for a general ban.\"A law must<br />\nbe specific,\" he said.<br />\nHe then explained his unique approach<br />\nto the formulation of the Maryland Handgun Law. He took Federal Bureau of<br />\nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms legislation, which ban the importation of low<br />\nquality handguns from overseas, and applied them to Saturday Night Specials in<br />\nMaryland.<br />\n\"A Saturday Night Special is a weapon<br />\nnot useful for any legitimate sporting or<br /><br />\ndefensive purpose,\" he said. \"It is a gun<br />\nthat has certain physical criteria. It is<br />\ncheaply made and has poor ballistic<br />\nability.\"<br />\nThe Bureau legislation bans this type of<br />\nfirearm, and the Maryland Gun Law contains much of the same language contained therein. In the original draft of the bill,<br />\na provision appointed the police<br />\nsuperintendent to decide whether a handgun fits the criteria for Saturday Night<br />\nSpecials, said Montague.<br />\nThe NRA, which was represented in the<br />\nbill making process, objected to the apSee HANDGUNS, 3<br /><br />\n2/OCTOBER 7, 1988<br /><br />\nUndergrads<br />\nrelax, revel<br />\nat Fall Fest<br />\nby Anthony Tassi<br />\nThey came to Homewood from<br />\nall walks of life.

Your<br />\nalarm clock has just jarred you<br />\nfrom a deep dream in which you<br />\nwere on balmy beach somewhere<br />\nfar away from Baltimore, and the<br />\nreality of a rainy morning hits<br />\nhard. You grab a towel and shuffle down the hallway of your<br />\napartment, stepping around the<br />\nsticky spots on the living room<br />\nfloor, and open the bathroom<br />\ndoor.<br />\nAt first your Morning Stupids<br />\nseem to blame. Your ceiling is in<br />\nthe bathtub and all over the<br />\nfloor...but if it's on the floor then<br />\nit should be the floor because ceilings are supposed to be above<br />\nyour head..,no, it is definitely on<br />\nthe floor, and it is definitely not<br />\nthe floor you had yesterday. You<br />\nstare a little longer. It is unquestionably your ceiling, piled up in<br />\nchunks of plaster, rusted steel<br />\nplate, odd brown greasy stuff and<br />\npipes. Underneath it all is the<br />\nlowered ceiling which you had<br />\nthought kind of fishy when you<br />\nmoved in since none of the other<br />\napartments in the building had<br />\nlowered ceilings.

You invite your<br />\nmanager, who does not seem to<br />\nhave any idea who the hell you<br /><br />\nare, to stick his hand into the grab<br />\nbag and give your ceiling a good<br />\nfeel. He declines.<br />\n\"Who the hell are you?\" he<br />\nasks.<br />\nYou explain. He looks at you<br />\ndisbelievingly. You demand a<br />\nnew ceiling. Now. You say you<br />\nwon't pay rent until it is done. He<br />\ntells you not to threaten him. You<br />\ntry to explain that if his ceiling<br />\nwas communing with his bathtub,<br />\nhe would be upset,too. He tells<br />\nyou someone will be up to look<br />\nat it immediately.<br />\nThree days later, with the exception of a maintenance man<br />\nwho came in and laughed,<br />\nnothing has happened. You call<br />\nyour father, who is known in the<br />\nrestaurant and airline industries<br />\nfor his use of sheer terror to get<br />\nservice, and ask him to put the<br />\nfear of God into management. He<br />\nevidently does so, because a few<br />\nminutes later three maintenance<br />\nmen come to the apartment, stare<br />\nup at what used to be your<br />\nbathroom celiling, and laugh.<br />\nThey laugh a lot. After noting that<br />\nyour ceiling has fallen in and that<br />\nthe floor above you is visible,<br />\nthey leave. You can hear them<br />\nlaughing as they walk down the<br />\nhallway.

What I want to hear is<br />\npassion and emotion, and technique figures in only when I feel<br />\nan artist isn't capable of expressing<br />\nhimself.<br />\nAll of which has a lot to do with<br />\nwhy one of the first \"punk\"<br />\nbands I ever got into was Midnight Oil. On any given Oils<br />\nalbum there's enough passion<br />\nthere for three other bands<br />\nbesides. So when I went to hear<br />\nthe Oils play at Towson State<br />\nTuesday night, I was expecting<br /><br />\nlots of passion\u2014after all, I had<br />\nnever seen a concert photo of lead<br />\nsinger Peter Garrett that didn't<br />\nmake him look like an absolute<br />\nmaniac.<br />\nAccording to Garrett, the Oils<br />\ndecided to play a small venue like<br />\nTowson because they wanted to<br />\nperform \"in a moderate place for<br />\nmoderate people.\" There was<br />\nnothing moderate about their<br />\nperformance.<br />\nSome bands take a few songs<br />\nto get up to speed. With the Oils,<br />\nyou have instant velocity. From<br />\nthe opening tune of\"Read About<br />\nIt\" it was obvious that we were<br />\nin for a high energy evening.<br />\nHigh energy, in fact, seems a bit<br /><br />\ninadequate to describe what these<br />\nguys do. With his jerky dancing<br />\nmotions Garrett resembles an<br />\nautomaton gone out of control,<br />\nhis battery pack having discharged all at once and filling him with<br />\nenergy that threatens to rip him<br />\napart. When the Oils rock, it's<br />\nlike a fusion reactor gone out of<br />\ncontrol, and when they're really<br />\ninto it...well, metaphors fail me,<br />\nbut images of tightly controlled<br />\nexplosions come to mind.<br />\nNot that the Oils aren't also<br />\ncapable of putting on the soft<br />\npedal. One of the shows's<br />\nhighlights was a haunting, urgent<br />\nversion of \"Sherman's Boxers\"<br />\nthat made the hairs on my neck<br /><br />\nOnMedia: The Media Bowl<br />\nby T.H. Kern<br />\nA month remains before the<br />\npresidential election takes place<br />\non November 8. But a serious<br />\nproblem remains, as well: the<br />\nforces of the media are covering<br />\nthe 1988 election campaign with<br />\nan unprecedented hunger for fluff<br />\nissues and political belly-button<br />\nlint. What began as a campaign<br />\nwith tangible issues has mutated<br />\ninto little more than an amateur<br />\nhour at a comedy club. Sure<br />\nenough, each of the presidential<br />\ncandidates labors every day to<br />\nmake his opponent look like an<br />\namateur. This is not done by<br />\ndiscussing political issues, but<br />\nwith peppy one-liners and photo<br />\nopportunities. \"Comedy\" is an<br />\naccurate description.<br />\nThe first of the two presidential debates brought this labor of<br />\nloopiness to its logical conclusion. The 90-minute program<br />\npresented each of the candidates<br />\nwith a number of serious questions about the future of the<br />\nUnited States, but few real solutions were offered by either of the<br />\nmen who would be president. Instead, the now-traditional vague<br />\npromises to \"make America<br />\ngreat\" and \"lower that deficit\"<br />\nabounded in a sea of sarcastic<br />\nremarks and\u2014you guessed it\u2014<br />\nmore one-liners. Public interest,<br />\nreports show, was unusually low,<br />\nand dissatisfaction with the candidates' answers considerable.<br />\nBut the candidates aren't the only ones at fault. The media has<br />\nextinguished the issues for better ratings, and America is paying the price.<br />\nBy most accounts, the undecided American voters\u2014comprising<br />\na staggering 33 percent of the<br />\nelectorate\u2014are fed up with the<br />\nbrainlessness of the campaign and<br />\nthe blandness of the candidates'<br />\npositions on key issues. But the<br />\nissues weren't always as vapid as<br />\nthey now are. In the two months<br />\npreceding the party conventions<br />\nin late July and early August,<br />\nvoter poll results varied wildly<br />\nfrom week to week. In part, this<br />\nwas a function of levity; it was<br />\nearly and few voters had fierce<br />\nloyalties to either candidate. At<br />\nthe same time, however, issues<br /><br />\nwere being directly addressed and<br />\nfaithfully reported\u2014the network<br />\nnews was much more apt to show<br />\na clip of a candidate disussing<br />\nplatform views than of him insulting his rivals. The newspapers<br />\nwere equally intelligent. Columnists zealously brought issues into the light for the candidates to<br />\naddress, then reproached them if<br />\nthey failed to do so. Politically<br />\nspeaking, there was an issue on<br />\nevery channel. Candidates had to<br />\nearn their support the hard way.<br />\nThat isn't so anymore. Since<br />\nGeorge Bush made the surprising<br />\nchoice of Indiana Senator Dan<br />\nQuayle for his running mate, the<br />\nomnicient media has transformed<br />\nthe campaign into a mud-slinging<br />\ncircus. The first glob was flung<br />\nby the media concerning Quayle's<br />\nduty in the Indiana National<br />\nGuard, which he was rumored to<br />\nhave assumed via connections to<br />\navoid active duty in Viet Nam.<br />\nThe media, already stumped by<br />\nBush's motives for choosing<br />\nQuayle, zeroed in with I.H1precedented force for two weeks,<br />\noverturning every stone in<br />\nQuayle's past while ignoring both<br />\nhis questionable academic record<br />\nand his work in the Senate. Thus<br />\nbegan what columnist William<br />\nRaspberry has dubbed, \"The<br />\nCampaign As Soap Opera.\"<br />\nThis episode has set the pace<br />\nfor the campaign ever since.<br />\nWhat used to be a forum for<br />\ndebate is now a bathroom wall for<br />\npolitical graffiti; the candidates<br />\ndon't expound on their strengths<br />\nnearly as often as their opponents'<br />\nflaws in character, patriotism,<br />\nor\u2014occasionally\u2014ability.<br />\nSomehow, the press has put<br />\nthe entire campaign on the defensive; down and dirty has been the<br />\ntone of the candidates' speeches,<br />\nbland and benevolent their solutions to problems both present<br />\nand future. They both seem afraid<br />\nto take a stand by the issues,<br />\nclinging instead to the ideas that<br />\nnow make American politics<br />\ngreat: media exposure of dirt<br />\nfrom a candidate's past; media<br />\nallowing the candidates to speak<br />\nbefore purple mountain majesties;<br />\nmedia spurring the frantic campaigns to send candidates into<br />\nBoston Harbor for boat rides.<br />\nMedia technology, in all its<br /><br />\nforms, has long occupied a<br />\nsignificant place in American<br />\npolitics. But only this year does<br />\nits influence seem so great as to<br />\ncompletely dominate the campaign, for its priorities have all<br />\nbut left substance for dead,<br />\nreplacing it with \"entertainment\"<br />\ncoverage. The public was charmed by this concept briefly, but as<br />\nthe status in opinion polls (yet<br />\nanother arm of the establishment)<br />\nindicates, America has had it with<br />\nthis particular soap opera. The<br />\nquestion is no longer rhetorical:<br />\nShouldn't Presidential campaigns<br />\nhave a little more pith than this?<br />\nThe now-tired complaint about<br />\nthe campaign having no issues is<br />\nridiculous; the issues are not absent, they're being ignored.<br />\nWhere have they gone? Ask the<br />\npeople in the different campaigns\u2014because, by my estimate,<br />\nthere are at least three going on<br />\nright now.<br />\nThe first campaign is the<br />\npseudo-platform campaign: the<br />\ncandidates make their daily appearances, ideally hammering<br />\nhome both their message of peace<br />\nand prosperity and some specifics<br />\nas to how to achieve it. Lately,<br />\nthough, it consists of clever<br />\nresponses to opponent's attacks of.<br />\npersonality. This campaign is<br />\n\"pseudo-\" because party platforms have been eroded by a<br />\nstorm of crowd-pleasing<br />\nimprovisations.<br />\nThe second campaign is Big<br />\nBrother Media's campaign: nightly news spots, front-page<br />\ncoverage of the day's one-liners,<br />\nnewspaper distillations of \"the<br />\ncampaign today,\" and so on.<br />\nThis campaign exerts tremendous<br />\nforce over the other campaigns,<br />\nbut it is not (as many have suggested) the whole story.<br />\nThe third campaign is run by<br />\ncolumnists and editorial writers,<br />\na group less bound to objectivity<br />\nthan the rest of the \"news\"<br />\nmedia. More often than not, it<br />\nbrings to light the issues which<br />\nhave been carefully buried by the<br />\nrest of the media and, therefore,<br />\nthe candidates. Although the third<br />\ncampaign is often partisan and<br />\ncertainly affected by the daily<br />\nmedia side show, it consistently<br />\nSee MEDIA, 15<br /><br />\nstand up as Garrett, backed by a<br />\nminimal guitar and a drum track,<br />\npleaded, \"why do you keep coming back for more?\" The Oils<br />\nunderstand there is as much<br />\npower in the gentle and controlled as in the powerful and<br /><br />\n\"Garrett resembles an<br />\nautomaton out ofcontrol.\"<br />\nfrenzied.<br />\nSomething else they understand<br />\nis that a concert is a place for the<br />\nband and their fans to get<br />\ntogether, and not a venue to hype<br />\ntheir latest album. Three songs<br />\ninto the set Garrett announced that<br />\nthey were going \"to do the television song and get it over with,\"<br />\nwhereupon they launched into<br />\n\"Beds are Burning.\" By my<br />\ncount, not including encores, the<br />\nOils only played four other songs<br />\noff the new album, dedicating the<br />\nrest of the show to both older and<br />\nbrand new material. Best of all,<br />\nthe audience wasn't subjected to<br />\na rehash of album versions of the<br /><br />\nold material. Whether it was a<br />\nguitar break, an extended instrumental section, or simply different instrumentation, the Oils<br />\nattempted to give their audience<br />\nsomething new and interesting<br />\nwith each song. Such respect for<br />\none's fans is refreshing in a day<br />\nand age where many performers<br />\nseem to regard their audience as<br />\na necessary evil to be tolerated for<br />\nas short a period of time as<br />\npossible.<br />\nFinally, though the Oils are a<br />\nband known for their political<br />\nstance, they did a marvellous job<br />\nof keeping the polemics to a<br />\nminimum. The Oils see their purpose as being to both inform and<br />\nentertain, and prefer to let their<br />\nact speak for them, as it should.<br />\nI recently read an article by someone who ridiculed Amnesty<br />\nInternational for putting on a rock<br />\nconcert that made them seem<br />\nfrivolous, and accomplished<br />\nnothing. Maybe if the author of<br />\nthat article spent two hours at a<br />\nMidnight Oil concert, he'd<br />\nunderstand how music can communicate a wealth of feeling and<br />\nemotion that mere words and<br />\nrhetoric could never approach.<br /><br />\nHis Masters' Voice<br />\nby T.H. Kern<br />\nCredit Branford Marsalis for<br />\nfollowing his own Muse. For<br />\nwhile critics have been clamoring<br />\nfor him to quit hedging and<br />\ndevelop his own style of playing,<br />\nhe has been forging one with both<br />\noriginality and the unmistakable<br />\nechoes of his saxophone elders.<br />\nIt's undeniable that Ben Webster,<br />\nJohn Coltrane, Sonny Rollins,<br />\nand especially Wayne Shorter can<br />\nbe heard in his playing. But the<br />\nunique voices of these saxophone<br />\ngiants\u2014influences for any saxophone<br />\nplayer<br />\nof<br />\nhis<br />\ngeneration\u2014are no crutch for the<br />\n28 year old Marsalis. Instead,<br />\nthey have provided him with a<br />\nsophisticated<br />\nemotional<br />\nvocabulary for his improvisational work. This is nothing<br />\nespecially new; it's been brewing<br />\nfor years. But on his new \"Random Abstract' (Columbia 44055;<br />\nLP, CD, and cassette) the<br />\nburgeoning young saxophone<br />\nplayer, with the aid of a crack<br />\nrhythm section and a variegated<br />\nset of compositions, has reached<br />\na new level of lucidity and<br />\ncommand.<br />\nEven in the first bars of<br />\nShorter's \"Yes and No,\" the<br />\nrecord's first track, Marsalis<br />\nmakes it clear that he is playing<br />\nwith a new level of authority. The<br />\nfluidity of his swing is intense,<br />\nbut seems effortless. His leap<br />\nfrom the main melody into a dizzying improvisation is logical and<br />\nimplacable; it's almost impossible not to tap your feet along with<br />\nthe buoyancy of his phrasing. The<br />\nrhythm section\u2014pianist Kenny<br />\nKirkland, bassist Delbert Felix,<br />\nand drummer Lewis Nash\u2014play<br />\nwith furious accuracy, but usher<br />\nin sly shifts in dynamics between<br />\nthe \"yes\" and \"no\" sections of<br />\nthe tune, adding emotional<br /><br />\ndimensions to the melody that<br />\nShorter's original had only suggested. Nash's timekeeping is<br />\nsure and deadly, and it meshes<br />\nwell with Kirkland's jaggedly<br />\npercussive piano solo.<br />\nMuch of the appeal of \"Random Abstract\" lies in the two<br />\nlevels of virtuosity operating<br />\nthroughout the album. For on one<br />\nhand, this quartet works almost<br />\nseamlessly as a unit.(At the time<br />\nof the recording, they had been<br />\nplaying together for roughly a<br />\nyear and a halt). But on the other<br />\nhand, Marsalis and the rhythm<br />\nsection each function so well individually that it's often tempting<br />\nto pry them apart for pleasure's<br />\nsake. Although \"Yes and No\"<br />\nbenefits tremendously from such<br />\ndissection, further such interplay<br />\ncan be found on \"Crescent City\"(Kirkland's lengthy solo is set<br />\nin an ideal piano trio format) and<br />\n\"I Thought About You,\" Marsalis' purported farewell to his<br />\nBen Webster emulation. His<br />\nrestless tenor reading of Ornette<br />\nColeman's \"Lonely Woman\"<br />\nmolds so well with the rest of the<br />\nband that the listener has to all but<br />\npeel apart the fine layers of<br />\ninstrumentation.<br />\nNot all of\"Random Abstract\"<br />\nruns so smoothly. Both \"Broadway Fools\" and the sinewy<br />\n\"LonJellis\" seem unnecessarily<br />\ndisjointed. The latter is largely a<br />\nvehicle for Nash, whose<br />\nimpressive\u2014and<br />\npoorly<br />\nrecorded\u2014drum work deserves a<br />\nbetter showcase. \"Broadway<br />\nFools\" finds Marsalis skittering<br />\nthrough a disarming soprano<br />\nsolo, and Kirkland's piano figures<br />\nare humorous in kind, but less<br />\nthan satisfying. Felix's bass line<br />\noffers the most enjoyable aspect<br />\nof the piece: sure and unhurried,<br />\nSee FLIPSIDE, 15<br /><br />\nN EWS-LETTER/15<br />\nTimes are<br />\nrespectively.<br /><br />\nARTSCAL<br />\nFILM<br />\nWeekend<br />\nThis<br />\nweek<br />\nWonderflix presents The Princess<br />\nBride in Shriver Hall, Friday and<br />\nSaturday at 8 and 10:15.

Apparently, as the statistics<br />\nsuggest, the answer is often no.<br />\nThis decision may stem from a<br />\nnumber of things. Recently much<br />\npublicity has centered around the<br />\ninterference of the practice of<br />\nmedicine by other people. At one<br />\ntime, the physician was thought<br />\nto be his own boss, but now commonly the doctor must work<br />\nunder the supervision of other<br />\npeople or corporations. The intrusion of government and the role<br />\nof insurance agcncies have also<br />\nturned many away from this<br />\nprofession.<br />\nA more practical reason affecting a student's decision is cost.<br />\nTypically the medical student<br />\nleaves his or her institution with<br />\na forty to fifty thousand dollar<br />\nloan, a tremendous burden to saddle. Obviously the bad publicity<br />\nabout malpractice, fear of AIDS,<br />\nand the prediction of an oversupply of physicians in the near<br />\nfuture also has led to a national<br />\ndecline in this field.<br />\nIf the above rhetoric has not<br />\ndeterred you, perhaps a consoling note is that the total number<br />\nof Hopkins pre-meds has not<br />\nreflected this decline. What ad-<br /><br />\nvice can then be given to the naive<br />\npre-med student? Dr. Gryder has<br />\nstressed that deciding to be a doctor is by no means a limiting experience. The medical field provides a vast array of interests,<br />\nanywhere from being a pediatrician to acting as a consultant on<br />\ninternational health. One must investigate the advantages and<br />\ndisadvantages of a given health<br />\ncareer and let his or her natural<br />\ninclination provide the guidance.<br />\nThe undergraduate's chosen major should reflect what the individual finds interesting. Again<br />\na science field may not necessarily be more useful in a medical<br />\nsetting.<br />\nMedical applications often<br />\nplace an emphasis on grades and<br />\nMedical College Admissions\"<br />\nTests (MCAT). These, Dr.<br />\nGryder feels, get the student<br />\nthrough \"the door\" or initial cut.<br />\nThe most important criteria seem<br />\nto be the interview and extracurricular activities\u2014how the individual spends his time when not<br />\nstudying. This is not just a matter of listing a series of clubs but<br />\nrather a documentation of what<br />\none has done while at the university. Research, for some individuals, may be a form of extracurricular involvement; for<br />\nothers, the playing of varsity<br />\nsports or writing articles in student journals may fill this<br />\ncategory. But despite any of these<br />\ncredentials\u2014grades, scores, or<br />\nschool activities, the interview<br />\nmay determine admission to a<br />\ngiven medical institution.

According to a recent<br />\nGallup Poll, to a majority of<br />\nAmericans today, Hopkins means<br />\nmedicine.<br />\nTo celebrate the Centennial,<br />\nJohns Hopkins is planning an array of activities. The major<br />\nevents will take place June 7-11,<br />\n1989, with scientific Symposia,<br />\nthe unveiling of a U.S. postage<br />\nstamp honoring Mr. Johns<br />\nHopkins, an art exhibit featuring<br />\nmedical masterpieces, gala concerts, and fireworks.<br />\nThe record of the 1,000-bed<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital, the<br />\nSchool of Medicine, School of<br />\nNursing and the nation's oldest<br /><br />\nand largest School of Public<br />\nHealth stems directly from their<br />\nfounder's determination to seek<br />\nnew knowledge rather than rely<br />\non accepted wisdom. Hopkins<br />\nwas the first medical center where<br />\nteaching, research and patient<br />\ncare were truly integrated. So<br />\ngreat was the power and productivity of this tripartite union that<br />\nit gave rise to a new era of scientific medicine.<br />\nAs a result, Hopkins had an important role in the development of<br />\nmajor subspecialties, from<br />\npediatrics and urology to<br />\nneurosurgery and medical<br />\ngenetics. Hopkins surgeons were<br />\nthe first to use rubber gloves, and<br />\nHopkins scientists discovered<br />\nadrenalin and heparin, purified<br />\ndiscovered<br />\nand<br />\ninsulin,<br />\nDramamine's effectiveness<br />\nagainst motion sickness.<br />\nThey developed the Blue Baby<br />\noperation that ushered in the era<br />\nof modern heart surgery, found<br />\nkeys to controlling the most common forms of blindness,<br />\ndeveloped life-saving CPR and<br />\ntissue culture, earned a Nobel<br />\nprize for the discovery of restriction enzymes (the chemical<br />\nknives that cut genes), uncovered<br />\nopiate receptors and pioneered in<br />\nnew directions in brain<br /><br />\nchemistry, drug development and<br />\nbiological psychiatry.<br />\nHopkins public health investigators spread water chlorination throughout the world, identified the three types of polio<br />\nvirus, discovered vitamin D and<br />\nB complex, and altered the eating<br />\nhabits of the American public.<br />\nThe Hospital that opened its<br />\ndoors on May 7, 1889, was the<br />\nlegacy of Johns Hopkins, a visionary Quaker and Baltimore<br />\nmerchant who bequeathed $7<br />\nmillion to found a new-style<br />\nuniversity and hospital. The<br />\nstipulations in his will and in a letter of instruction to his trustees<br />\nspelled out a unique relationsip<br />\nbetween the Hospital and the<br />\nUniversity's School of Medicine<br />\nthat created a national model for<br />\nmodern medical education and<br />\npatient care.<br />\nBefore his death on Christmas<br />\nEve 1873, at the age of 78,<br />\nHopkins purchased 13 acres in<br />\nEast Baltimore and gave it to his<br />\ntrustees with a detailed letter that<br />\nspecified that care in his hospital<br />\nwas to be given \"without regard<br />\nto sex, age, or color.\" The<br />\nHospital that was constructed on<br />\nthe site included buildings designed as monuments to the city.<br />\nSeveral remain in use and are<br /><br />\nlisted on the National Register of<br />\nHistoric Places. They represent<br />\nthe first attempt at a germcontrolled environment.<br />\nA century ago, most patients<br />\nwere treated in their homes, and<br />\nhospitals were asylums for the<br />\npoor. Those who did come into<br />\nthe hospital frequently died after<br />\nsurgery. Operations were performed on open wards, and<br />\nphysicians' \"training\" was<br />\ngenerally limited to a few months<br />\nof formal lectures. Schools of<br />\nmedicine usually were not linked<br />\nto hospital settings, and physicians could go out into practice<br />\nwithout ever having laid a hand<br />\non a patient.<br />\nThe Hopkins Hospital and<br />\nSchool of Medicine changed all<br />\nthat. Hopkins required the training of physicians at a graduate<br />\nlevel\u2014a baccalaureate was<br />\nnecessary for admisision to the<br />\nSchool of Medicine\u2014with rigid<br />\nentrance requirements in the basic<br />\nsciences. The incorporation of a<br />\nhospital as the training ground for<br />\ndoctors, careful bedside learning<br />\nas part of the educational process,<br />\nthe extension of medical education through postgraduate<br />\nresidencies and fellowships, the<br />\nemphasis on research as well as<br />\ndelivery of patient care, the in-<br /><br />\ntroduction of full-time salaried<br />\nscientist-physicians, and the acceptance of women students as<br />\nthe equals of men were among the<br />\nradical changes that owe their existence to the Hopkins School of<br />\nMedicine.<br />\nHopkins gathered its early<br />\nfaculty from the finest talents in<br />\nthe nation, many of them<br />\nEuropean-trained, and gave them<br />\njoint appointments at the Hopital<br />\nand University. The influence of<br />\nthese founding physicians\u2014<br />\nWelch, Osier, Halsted and<br />\nKelly\u2014trained a generation who<br />\nspread the Hopkins standards to<br />\nother medical institutions across<br />\nAmerica. This tradition continues<br />\ntoday, as Hopkins alumni<br />\nspearhead medical innovations<br />\nnot only in Baltimore but also in<br />\nmost of the largest academic and<br />\nresearch centers in the nation.<br />\nAdvances in medical procedures<br />\npioneered at Hopkins have<br />\nbecome routine staples of medical<br />\npractice.<br />\nSimilarly, the standards<br />\ndeveloped in nursing education<br />\nhad their roots in the original<br />\nTraining School of Nurses that<br />\nwas part of Mr. Hopkins' bequest.

Despite recent losses<br />\nto Washington and Goucher Colleges, the team has demonstrated<br />\na lot of potential and strength by<br />\ndecisively beating their opponents<br />\nstatistically despite suffering<br />\nlosses when the points were<br />\ntotalled.<br />\nHopkins' loss to Washington<br />\ncame after a long five game<br />\nmatch, played instead of the usual<br />\nthree game match due to both<br />\nteams' presence in the MAC. The<br />\nLady Jays won the first two<br />\ngames but dropped the final<br />\nthree, the fifth resulting in a<br />\n14-16 heartbreaker. After this tiring bout with Washington, the<br /><br />\nLady Jays couldn't come up with<br />\nenough strength to defeat an inferior Goucher squad, resulting in<br />\na 13-15, 12-15 loss to the<br />\nGophers. Co-captain Joy Boyer<br />\nfeels that her team is \"really playing well together. There has been<br />\na lot of improvement on the team,<br />\nand we've beaten them [their opponents] in stats, we just haven't<br />\nwon in points.\"<br />\nPreceding the losses to<br />\nWashington and Goucher, the<br />\nLady Jays defeated Hood,<br />\nManhattanville, and Notre Dame<br />\nColleges, while suffering losses<br />\nto Dickinson and Catonsville CC.<br />\nThe win over Notre Dame was<br />\nespecially sweet for first-year<br />\ncoach Bill Jones, who left his<br />\nassistant coaching position at<br />\nNotre Dame to take the head spot<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nBoyer, Angela Muras, Petrina .<br /><br />\nHsi, Beth Monaghan, and<br />\nfreshmen Trang Pham and Jenny<br />\nKishimoni have been starting and<br />\nplaying well for the Lady Jays.<br />\nBoth freshmen are strong hitters,<br />\nand have been an asset to the team<br />\nin all capabilities this season.<br />\nDawn Nee and co-captain Ashi<br />\nRafi have been very effective on<br />\nkills, and according to Rafi,\"We<br />\nhave a lot of skill on our team,<br />\nthe most we've ever had.\" A<br />\nnumber of the Lady Jays have<br />\nshown a marked improvement in<br />\nskill over last season.

Seidman edged out Hopkins' star sharpshooter<br />\nJim Kielkopf, who shot below his,<br />\nbest for 516. Also posting personal best scores were Matthew<br />\nMayr with 477 and Larry Young<br />\nwith 475.<br />\nThe match course consisted of<br />\n60 shots, 20 shots in each position of prone, standing, and<br />\nkneeling. Each shot is worth a<br /><br />\n$2.0\u00b0 OFF<br /><br />\nawarded Coach Hardy the first<br />\nCoach of the Year award for his<br />\nefforts in bringing Hopkins back<br />\nto a competetive standing in the<br />\nConference and for his lifelong<br />\ndevotion to the sport of competitive shooting.<br />\nDue to its low-profile, the rifle team is often confused with<br />\nother organizations.

During both halves<br />\nof regulation time and the overtime period, the Hooters<br />\ndominated the game in the air and<br />\non the ground. In the air, 6'5\"<br /><br />\nGeoff Manning was unbeatable<br />\non head balls while, the passing<br />\ngame was excellent as all players<br />\non the field were moving and<br />\ncommunicating consistently. This<br />\ntired out the Ursinus squad and<br />\ncreated holes for easy passes.<br />\nFinishing shots off, however,<br />\nhas been very hard lately. Some<br />\nshots have been missing the goal<br />\nby mere inches while other shots<br /><br />\nCraig Weinstein battles past the opposing goalie.<br /><br />\nFile photo<br /><br />\nthat appear to be going in are<br />\ndeflected or saved by the opposing team. That was the story Friday night.<br />\nAt one practice, Coach Haus<br />\nhad the team working on finishing<br />\noff their shots for over an hour.<br />\nHowever, this lack of scoring is<br />\nmental and not physical. There is<br />\nno more pressure of having to<br />\nwin every game and new players<br />\nwill be more relaxed as they go<br />\ninto games.<br />\nThe next game took place at<br />\nSalisbury on Monday, October 3.<br />\nThis game was exactly like the<br />\nUrsinus game: the Hooters<br />\ndominated every aspect of the<br />\ngame but couldn't score. That<br />\nchanged in the final two minutes<br />\nof the game as Geoff Manning<br />\nflew through to head Jim McKiernan's corner kick past Salisbury<br />\nkeeper.<br />\nThe 1-0 win meant a lot to the<br />\nteam. It was their first road victory and more importantly, it<br />\nshowed that if they play the way<br />\nthey are capable of playing for<br />\nninty minutes, they'll win.<br />\nThe defense played very well<br />\nas the No-Goal Patrol was in control. Again, Manning was<br />\nsuperior in the air. Jeff Cadeddu<br />\nwas also excellent in the air. On<br />\nthe ground, it seemed that Eric<br />\nLindenbaum never lost a tackle.<br />\nHe consistently got a piece of<br />\nevery ball. Jerry Irvine came<br />\nthrough for his third consecutive<br />\nstart out with some timely saves.<br />\nHopkins next home game is<br />\nagainst Swarthmore on Friday,<br />\nOctober 15, at 7 p.m.<br /><br />\nHEY HOPKINS!!<br />\neady for a reat<br />\nnew local bar??<br />\nCOMING SOON!!<br />\n27th Street Station<br />\n(Howard &amp; 27th St)<br />\n467-7188<br /><br />\nfeaturing...<br />\n*Gre t CD Sound<br />\n*14 speakers<br />\n*Tremendous food and drink<br />\n*Jobs available for students<br />\n*Incredible school ID specials<br />\n*Banquet rooms for fraternity<br />\nand other parties<br /><br />\nFile photo<br /><br />\nGrenville Jones leaps between defenders for a header.<br /><br />\nome out and support<br />\nJohns Hopkins Crew<br />\nat the<br /><br />\nARIEL REGATTA<br />\nbeirp) held Saturday<br />\nOctober 8, around and<br />\nabout the Hanover<br />\nStreet it ride e.<br /><br />\nWhy?<br />\nit's FREE for starters,<br />\nI.ut more importantly\u2014<br />\nIt's Fun to Watch<br />\nBecause it Looks Cool!!<br />\nBeer and refreshments<br />\navailable<br />\nGuaranteed to be better<br />\nthan Oxford Blues<br /><br />\nCome On Down and PARTY!<br /><br />\nShuttles will be running:<br /><br />\nStay Tuned...<br /><br />\nfrom the Athletic Center:<br />\n12:00 P.M.<br />\n2:00 P.M.<br />\n3:00 P.M.<br /><br />\nfrom the Boathouse:<br />\n1:30 P.M.<br />\n2:30 P.M.<br />\n5:30 P.M.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/23<br /><br />\nDulin drives for win<br /><br />\nGrid notes<br /><br />\nCENTENNIAL FOOTBALL<br /><br />\nFOOTBALL, from 19<br />\nby Michael J. Pocchia<br />\nAlthough the Hopkins football<br />\nteam began its season with a<br />\nshaky start, certain players have<br />\nconsistently contributed a high<br />\nlevel of performance that the final<br />\nscores do not show. One of those<br />\nplayers is co-captain Brian Dulin.<br />\nDulin, now in his senior year<br />\nat Hopkins, has been a starting<br />\nrunning back since his freshman<br />\nyear. By the end of his junior<br />\nyear, the 5'7\", 175 lb. Blue Jay<br />\nfrom Philadelphia had already<br />\nfound himself seventh on the alltime Hopkins statistics list for<br />\ntotal career rushing yardage. Last<br />\nseason alone, Dulin had 136 carries for 462 yards, an average of<br />\n42.6 yards per game. His receiving percentages are also impressive: he caught 10 passes for<br />\n174 yards and led the Jays with<br />\nseven touchdown receptions.<br />\nIn preparation for his senior<br />\nyear, it was important to Dulin,<br />\nnow that he was going to be a cocaptain, to work even harder for<br />\nthe team. He spent his summer<br />\nlifeguarding on a beach in Stone<br />\nHarbor, New Jersey, and the job<br />\ngave him the time and the<br />\nfacilities to increase his speed,<br /><br />\nstrength, and endurance.<br />\nHis hard work appears to have<br />\npaid off, for in his first four<br />\ngames this season, Dulin has run<br />\nfor 217 yards on 48 carries, giving him a total of 1,410 yards<br />\nrushing in his career at Hopkins.<br />\nThis places him sixth on the JHU<br />\nall-time leading rushing list.<br />\nStatistics and records are,<br />\nhowever, unimportant to Dulin.<br />\nAsked about his chances of moving into the number five spot,<br />\nDulin replied that he would rather<br />\ntrade all his yardage and personal<br />\ngains for wins for the good of the<br />\nteam.<br />\nDulin, along with the rest of the<br />\nBlue Jays, will have a chance to<br />\ngo after the first win this Saturday against Ursinus. According<br />\nto Dulin, the team has been working very hard this week to prepare<br />\nfor the game. The wishbone offense will be abandoned and, as<br />\na result, a more diversified offense will be utilized.<br />\nThe team is treating this game<br />\nas if it were the first game of the<br />\nseason. Dulin said, \"Ursinus will<br />\nbe our starting point to pick<br />\nourselves up. Everyone has a<br />\ngood attitude, and we are ready<br />\nto start winning.\"<br /><br />\nCoach leads the way<br />\nin GMU Invitational<br />\nby Coleen Furey<br />\nThe women's cross country<br />\nteam competed in the George<br />\nMason Invitational last Saturday<br />\nagainst some very strong teams.<br />\nThe Blue Jays finished ninth out<br />\nof eleven schools but showed<br />\nindividual<br />\nsome<br />\nsolid<br />\nperformances.<br />\nSuzi McGinn was once again<br />\nthe first finisher for Hopkins with<br />\nan excellent time of 18:59.
