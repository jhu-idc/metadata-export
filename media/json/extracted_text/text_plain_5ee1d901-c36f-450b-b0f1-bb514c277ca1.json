Since his arrival six years<br />\nago, Mr Anderson has published six books, each of which<br />\nhas marked a distinct growth in this development. His latest<br />\nwork to be published in book form is The Triumph of the<br />\nEgg, a collection of his best short stories. This was probably<br />\nthe most seriously discussed book of the past year.<br />\nMANY MARRIAGES, his latest novel, both in theme and<br />\ntreatment, stands far apart from the run of novels dealing<br />\nwith the American scene. The confident belief held by<br />\nAmerican and foreign critics in Mr Anderson's future will<br />\nbe justified by this new novel, for in it he has gone farther<br />\nthan in any previous work in the full development of his<br />\nart. A man living in a small town in the State of Wisconsin is the central character of this significant work. It is<br />\nthe story of the love and marriage of a man,told as the man<br />\nunderstands it on the decisive night when the marriage<br />\ncomes to an end. The intensity of emotion and the richness<br />\nof imagination are equally remarkable. This novel marks<br />\na distinct break from the methods of photographic realism<br />\nso much in vogue among writers of the middle west. It is<br />\nthe most important work that Mr Anderson has produced<br />\nso far, and is certain to be acclaimed by the discriminating<br />\nas a permanent contribution to American letters.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nParticular<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\nr<br />\nCavia<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nE DIAL is not satisfied with being caviar to the<br />\ngeneral\u2014it is caviar to the particular.

Since his arrival six years<br />\nago, Mr Anderson has published six books, each of which<br />\nhas marked a distinct growth in this development. His latest<br />\nwork to be published in book form is The Triumph of the<br />\nEgg, a collection of his best short stories. This was probably<br />\nthe most seriously discussed book of the past year.<br />\nMANY MARRIAGES, his latest novel, both in theme and<br />\ntreatment, stands far apart from the run of novels dealing<br />\nwith the American scene. The confident belief held by<br />\nAmerican and foreign critics in Mr Anderson's future will<br />\nbe justified by this new novel, for in it he has gone farther<br />\nthan in any previous work in the full development of his<br />\nart. A man living in a small town in the State of Wisconsin is the central character of this significant work. It is<br />\nthe story of the love and marriage of a man,told as the man<br />\nunderstands it on the decisive night when the marriage<br />\ncomes to an end. The intensity of emotion and the richness<br />\nof imagination are equally remarkable. This novel marks<br />\na distinct break from the methods of photographic realism<br />\nso much in vogue among writers of the middle west. It is<br />\nthe most important work that Mr Anderson has produced<br />\nso far, and is certain to be acclaimed by the discriminating<br />\nas a permanent contribution to American letters.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nParticular<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\nr<br />\nCavia<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nE DIAL is not satisfied with being caviar to the<br />\ngeneral\u2014it is caviar to the particular.
