Wilson Shaffer<br />\nAss't. Sports Editor<br />\n<br />\nThe Hop That Might<br />\nThe Pigskin Hop is, by tradition, a happily uninhibited affair; everyone valves off vast quantities of<br />\nthe libidinal steam built up in Homewood's academic<br />\npressure cooker, does homage to the departing football<br />\nplayers and wakes up blearily satisfied on Sunday. If<br />\nnot a real \"Homecoming\" it is at least an excuse to<br />\ninvite a date for the weekend, relax, and relieve the<br />\ngray grind before Winter sets in. The function acquired<br />\nspecial significance this year as the only dance to escape<br />\nsacrifice to the Cotillion Board's \"Big Weekend.\"<br />\nIt is thus a major loss when this year's Pigskin<br />\nHop was diluted by its removal to the relatively sedate<br />\nsurroundings of Levering Hall. The change was, apparently, unavoidable. Blame can be fixed on a malevolent<br />\nspirit somewhere in the Gym who may bear the<br />\nephemeral and unsatisfactory designation of McFate.<br />\nThe reactions to the loss of the dance site were,<br />\nhowever, unfortunate in several respects. The casual<br />\nway in which John Morgan was informed that the Gym<br />\ncould not be used was (see \"Correspondence\") irresponsible. Surely a development of such significance deserved<br />\nprompt and efficient attention. One is led to wonder<br />\nwhat would have happened had a chance encounter not<br />\noccurred?<br />\nFurther, several fraternities have scheduled parties<br />\non Saturday night in response to the change. While<br />\nnot a surprising reaction, this is hardly in the interests<br />\nof the University Community as a whole. Without these<br />\nfraternities it will be even more difficult to recreate the<br />\nsuccessful mood of past years.<br />\nThe only thing that can save the Pigskin Hop is<br />\nundergraduate \"spirit.\" We have heard that such a<br />\nthing now exists at the rim of the Hole. If so, we shall<br />\nfind out Saturday night.<br />\n<br />\nDisappearing Act<br />\nThe indefatigable groundskeepers are planting<br />\nshrubs around newly completed Barton Hall, a hopeful<br />\nsign. Perhaps within a few generations this eyesore will<br />\nbe obscured by greenery, and with it a blot on our<br />\nproud campus removed. In the meantime let us all<br />\npray for rain.<br />\n<br />\nEnfer The Conquistador<br />\nMany of the weekly magazines of the country ran<br />\nfeatured stories this week on the \"Rebirth of Hope at<br />\nOle Miss.\" According to these articles, the Meredith<br />\ntrial balloon, which appears to be reaching an equilibrium level on the Mississippi campus has burst into a<br />\nsymbol of light and hope for academic freedom and<br />\neducational excellency in the community which once<br />\nso perfectly mirrored the novels of its late but distinguished citizen.<br />\nThe campus at Mississippi has been plagued with<br />\nWhite Citizens Councils ever since the 1954 U. S.<br />\nSupreme Court decision declaring segregation on a racial<br />\nbasis illegal. These councils were literally secret service<br />\ngroups which recorded speeches and panel discussions.<br />\nAccording to the Saturday Review, even those educators<br />\nwho voiced \"moderate\" opinions were profanely criticized and intimidated. The result was that within two<br />\nyears, one-fourth of the faculty of Ole Miss was advised<br />\nto leave the \"witch-hunting, thought-control climate.\"<br />\nPresently there is no precedent of dissent on Mississippi's campus, not even on the student newspaper which<br />\nhas been censored by the White Citizens Councils. However, since the first Meredith incidents, the faculty has<br />\nbegun to act. Much introspection accompanied by hope<br />\nof change has pervaded the University's atmosphere.<br />\nFearful of losing academic accreditation, the administration is no longer acting to suppress dissent in the<br />\nfaculty quarters.<br />\nThe dissent ,which is now springing up centers, it<br />\nseems, on the le* \"good Men\" who stuCk by Mississippi<br />\nduring its recent days of academic slavery. Perhaps in<br />\nits improved climate at the University, they can serve<br />\nas a rallying point for the fostering of the debate,<br />\nrebellion and dissent which is necessary for the freedom<br />\nwhich most American universities cherish and foster.<br />\n<br />\nBy BOB LANDAU<br />\nGerhart Hauptmann's The<br />\nBeaver Coat, written in 1893,<br />\nwas a contemptuous satire on<br />\nboth the peasantry and the<br />\nbureaucracy of that time. To the<br />\naudience of that day, this bitter,<br />\nyet comic view must have jabbed<br />\nvery close to home. Although<br />\nthe audience of today cannot<br />\ntruly identify with Hauptmann's<br />\ncharacters, the production at the<br />\nPlayshop presents them so vividPLAYSHOP ACTION ...

Wilson Shaffer<br />\nAss't. Sports Editor<br /><br />\nThe Hop That Might<br />\nThe Pigskin Hop is, by tradition, a happily uninhibited affair; everyone valves off vast quantities of<br />\nthe libidinal steam built up in Homewood's academic<br />\npressure cooker, does homage to the departing football<br />\nplayers and wakes up blearily satisfied on Sunday. If<br />\nnot a real \"Homecoming\" it is at least an excuse to<br />\ninvite a date for the weekend, relax, and relieve the<br />\ngray grind before Winter sets in. The function acquired<br />\nspecial significance this year as the only dance to escape<br />\nsacrifice to the Cotillion Board's \"Big Weekend.\"<br />\nIt is thus a major loss when this year's Pigskin<br />\nHop was diluted by its removal to the relatively sedate<br />\nsurroundings of Levering Hall. The change was, apparently, unavoidable. Blame can be fixed on a malevolent<br />\nspirit somewhere in the Gym who may bear the<br />\nephemeral and unsatisfactory designation of McFate.<br />\nThe reactions to the loss of the dance site were,<br />\nhowever, unfortunate in several respects. The casual<br />\nway in which John Morgan was informed that the Gym<br />\ncould not be used was (see \"Correspondence\") irresponsible. Surely a development of such significance deserved<br />\nprompt and efficient attention. One is led to wonder<br />\nwhat would have happened had a chance encounter not<br />\noccurred?<br />\nFurther, several fraternities have scheduled parties<br />\non Saturday night in response to the change. While<br />\nnot a surprising reaction, this is hardly in the interests<br />\nof the University Community as a whole. Without these<br />\nfraternities it will be even more difficult to recreate the<br />\nsuccessful mood of past years.<br />\nThe only thing that can save the Pigskin Hop is<br />\nundergraduate \"spirit.\" We have heard that such a<br />\nthing now exists at the rim of the Hole.

S.<br />\nSupreme Court decision declaring segregation on a racial<br />\nbasis illegal. These councils were literally secret service<br />\ngroups which recorded speeches and panel discussions.<br />\nAccording to the Saturday Review, even those educators<br />\nwho voiced \"moderate\" opinions were profanely criticized and intimidated. The result was that within two<br />\nyears, one-fourth of the faculty of Ole Miss was advised<br />\nto leave the \"witch-hunting, thought-control climate.\"<br />\nPresently there is no precedent of dissent on Mississippi's campus, not even on the student newspaper which<br />\nhas been censored by the White Citizens Councils. However, since the first Meredith incidents, the faculty has<br />\nbegun to act. Much introspection accompanied by hope<br />\nof change has pervaded the University's atmosphere.<br />\nFearful of losing academic accreditation, the administration is no longer acting to suppress dissent in the<br />\nfaculty quarters.<br />\nThe dissent ,which is now springing up centers, it<br />\nseems, on the le* \"good Men\" who stuCk by Mississippi<br />\nduring its recent days of academic slavery.
