Eisenhower Symposium, Ralph Nader dealt with a<br />\nwide range of issues and launched a bitter attack of President<br />\nCarter.<br />\nNader characterized Carter<br />\n&as a \"disaster\" as far as furthering the public interest was<br />\nconcerned, terming the President<br />\n5.1 a \"consumer fraud.\" He warned<br />\nthat the public should \"beware<br />\nof any candidate who drapes<br />\n<br />\nA'<br />\nConsumer advocate Ralph Nader<br />\n<br />\nNader Calls On Consumers<br />\nTo Demand Better Products<br />\nBY LINDSAY KAPLAN<br />\n<br />\nConsumer advocate Ralph<br />\nNader addressed a large audience<br />\nat yesterday's MSE Symposium<br />\non the need to develop a consumer perspective regarding technology. Opening his speech by<br />\nconsidering the problem of neglectful laws regarding auto<br />\nsafety, he used this issue, along<br />\nwith other examples, to explain<br />\nwhat exactly a consumer viewpoint is.<br />\nAlthough the tone of Nader's speech was humorously<br />\nironic throughout, his concern<br />\nfor the consumer in his relation<br />\nto technology was evident. For<br />\nexample, as a third-year law<br />\nstudent, Nader was told by his<br />\nprofessor that research of automobile safety was not worthwhile, because it did not reach<br />\n<br />\nthe \" 'level of complexity<br />\nsuitable to the intellectual pursuit' \". When Nader asked him<br />\nwhat subject was worthy of<br />\nserious study, \"the professor<br />\nreplied with a glow in his eye,<br />\n'Tax Law.'\"<br />\nNader's concern with the<br />\nproblems of automotive engineering stemmed from the fact<br />\nthat laws dealing with car<br />\ncollision were focused \"on the<br />\nhuman error in auto accidentsnot only for the (actual collision) but for what happens after<br />\nthe crash (i.e., any injuries<br />\nresulting from the design of the<br />\ncar).\" The emphasis on automotive design in the 50's (and still<br />\nto a great extent today) was on<br />\nthe appearance of the vehicle,<br />\nand not its safety. The fashionable tail fins of the 50's were<br />\naccepted by the public despite<br />\n<br />\nRent Control Decision<br />\nWill Affect Students<br />\nBY ANDREW HURLEY<br />\nAfter weeks of debate,<br />\nBaltimore citizens voted last<br />\nTuesday to support the rent<br />\ncontrol amendment to the city<br />\ncharter as Question K won a<br />\nfive-thousand-vote victory at the<br />\npolls. Of the 139,998 who voted<br />\n(representing 36% of the registered voters), almost 52% cast<br />\ntheir ballots in favor of the rent<br />\ncontrol amendment.<br />\nThe public supported the<br />\namendment despite the fact that<br />\n\"Keep Baltimore Best,\" the<br />\norganization that campaigned<br />\nagainst the proposal, outspent<br />\nthe supporters of Question K by<br />\na ratio of about 30 to one.<br />\nWith the approval of Question K, certain regulations will<br />\ngo into effect. A joint landlord-tenant commission will be<br />\ncreated to preside over permanent rent control in Baltimore.<br />\n<br />\nRents'will be rolled back to<br />\nlevels of between 4 and 6 per<br />\ncent more than they were in<br />\n1978. Another increase of between 4 and 7 per cent will<br />\nbe allowed beginning in January.<br />\nThe landlord-tenant commission,<br />\nmade up of two landlords, two<br />\ntenants and one homeowner,<br />\nwill decide future rent ceilings.<br />\nThe commission will also be<br />\nempowered to make exceptions<br />\nfor landlords who have to pay<br />\nextraordinarily high energy or<br />\nutility costs. The commission's<br />\npermission is required in order<br />\nfor a landlord to change the use<br />\nof his rental units.<br />\nThere is currently some<br />\nquestion as to the constitutional<br />\nvalidity of the amendment. In<br />\nthe near future, Supreme Judge<br />\nJoseph H.H. Kaplan will hear<br />\narguments in a case challenging<br />\nthe legality of the referendum<br />\ncont. on p. 3<br />\n<br />\nthe fact that the only purpose<br />\nwas \"to better hook the pedestrian with.\"<br />\nNader suggested that democracy be applied to technology;<br />\nthe consumer ought to question<br />\nwhy products are produced in<br />\nthe manner that they are. One<br />\nshould be able to ask for products that meet consumer demands of quality, and not have<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\ntheir religion around them, since<br />\nthey might be using it as a cloak<br />\nto hide something.\"<br />\nWhen asked to give his<br />\nopinion of other 1980 presidential candidates, Nader said Sen.<br />\nEdward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Gov. Jerry Brown of<br />\nCalifornia had little more to<br />\noffer. He added that to elicit any<br />\nresponse from candidates on the<br />\nissues of consumer protection,<br />\nvoters must organize.<br />\nNader said that the ideal<br />\npresidential candidate would recognize that as the leader of the<br />\nnation, he should recognize and<br />\nseek out \"the power of the<br />\npeople. You can't lead a citizenry which has beentripped of its<br />\npower.\" He commented that<br />\nCarter does not understand that<br />\na leader must \"call on an awakened citizenry.\" Nader blamed<br />\nthis unwillingness to listen to the<br />\npeople for the failure of several<br />\npro-consumer bills in Congress<br />\nwhen they faced \"corporate<br />\nopposition.\" Nader quoted a<br />\nfriend of Carter's as saying \"he<br />\ndoesn't learn easily, but he<br />\nlearns from his last mistake.\" He<br />\nalso said he has made many<br />\nsuggestions to the President<br />\n<br />\nwhich he has ignored.<br />\nNader was asked to define<br />\nthe public interest, and answered, \"Whatever the public thinks<br />\nis in their interest:\" He said it<br />\nshould maximize the good of the<br />\ngreatest number without jeapordizing the rights of others.<br />\nNader also spoke about rent<br />\ncontrol. He said that where there<br />\nwas rampant speculation and not<br />\nenough competition between<br />\nlandlords, it was necessary to<br />\nprotect the consumer. \"Rent<br />\ncontrol gives time to establish a<br />\nsystem which eliminates the<br />\nneed for rent control in the first<br />\nplace,\" he said. Nader added<br />\nthat rent control produces \"a<br />\nbreathing space, sometimes of<br />\nseveral years,\" in which to<br />\ncorrect a situation intolerable to<br />\nthe consumer.<br />\nNader was asked to express<br />\nhis feelings about the new<br />\nDepartment of Education. He<br />\nreplied, \"I don't have any<br />\nfeelings. You wanna ask me if I<br />\nhave any beliefs?\" He went on<br />\nto question whether the Department would make any difference at all, saying that only if<br />\n,it listened to the students as an<br />\ncont. on p. 3<br />\n<br />\nBook Center Gets Graded<br />\ndY MARK.TRACHTEN BERG<br />\n011 Tuesday, November 6,<br />\nthe Student Council Student<br />\nServices Committee, chaired by<br />\nCharles Peifer, met with officials<br />\nof the Hopkins Book Center to<br />\ndiscuss a wide variety of issues,<br />\nincluding store security, textbook prices, buy-back rates<br />\nfor used books and the Book<br />\nCenter's layout.

Dan<br />\nSnydacker, a member of the<br />\nGraduate Representative Organization who has been active with<br />\nthe issue, commented, \"I was<br />\npleased with the results of the<br />\nelection. It was a good vote and<br />\na meaningful vote. Even if it has<br />\nto be repealed, I think that it<br />\nwas a good step forward. It gives<br />\nBaltimore a chance to go even<br />\nfurther. I think that it will work<br />\nbut it requires an active faith<br />\nright now.\"<br />\nSnydacker went on to explain how students living in<br />\nUniversity-owned housing are<br />\nindirectly affected by the decision. Even though these apartments will not he subject to the<br />\nlaw, they will not be able to<br />\ncharge much higher prices than<br />\nother buildings in the immediate<br />\narea or students will rent the<br />\napartments with cheaper rates.<br />\nTherefore, if rents of nearby<br />\napartments<br />\ndecrease. Hopkins-owned apartments will most<br />\nlikely keep their prices at the<br />\nsame level.<br />\n<br />\nWhen asked for his reaction<br />\nto the decision, undergraduate<br />\nstudent Steve Menn said, \"I'm<br />\nvery pleased. Rent control is<br />\nneeded. I'm not crazy about<br />\ngovernment regulation\u2014they often screw things up\u2014but the<br />\nlandlords will certainly do so. I<br />\nhave<br />\nlived<br />\nmany<br />\nin<br />\nnon-rent-control areas and the<br />\nsituation was a mess.\"<br />\nSeveral students were not<br />\npleased with the outcome.<br />\nFreshman Demetrios Lefakis<br />\nsaid, \"It is a fundamental<br />\neconomic truth that rent control \u2022<br />\ncreates shortages in the supply<br />\nof housing and creates black<br />\nmarket tendencies. This means<br />\nthat some of us might not find a<br />\nplace to live next year and the<br />\nwhole equilibrium of the free<br />\nmarket will be upset.\"<br />\nOther students on campus<br />\nhave not decided whether or not<br />\nrent control is a good thing.<br />\nJohn Jove said, \"Rent control is<br />\ngood for us because we can't<br />\nas students afford to pay higher<br />\nrents.

If students<br />\ncould write to the Department<br />\nSecretary and ask about proposals, then Nader felt there would<br />\nbe some difference.<br />\nHe criticized the government's plan to bail out the<br />\nChrysler Corporation, saying<br />\n\"there isn't enough money in<br />\nthe Treasury to bail it out.\"<br />\nHe said Chrysler suffered from<br />\n\"very had management\" and<br />\nfailed to serve the consumer,<br />\nciting as examples the number of<br />\ncars recalled and the amount<br />\nof customer dissatisfaction with<br />\nChrysler products. He felt that<br />\nthis support was unfair to small<br />\nbusinesses since it implied that<br />\nthe government would only<br />\nassist a company in the event of<br />\nextensive mismanagement. He<br />\nrecommended that Chrysler find<br />\na buyer, \"take out a classified<br />\n<br />\nad,\" and pointed out that a<br />\ncontrolling interest could be had<br />\nfor one billion dollars.<br />\nNader attacked Detroit<br />\ncongressman John Dingel, a<br />\nmajor supporter of aid to<br />\nChrysler, as \"public interest<br />\nenemy number one\" because of<br />\nhis opposition to auto-emission<br />\ncontrols and mandatory passive<br />\nrestraint systems for cars.<br />\nNader said he supported the<br />\nderegulation of the trucking<br />\nindustry but said those who had<br />\nsupported airline deregulation<br />\nwould be sorry because of rising<br />\nprices and a decrease in safety<br />\ndue to the spread of commuter<br />\nairlines.

Someone shopping for<br />\na car with the corporate view in<br />\nmind would basically seek a<br />\nspecific style of car of a certain<br />\ncolor, at a certain price, and<br />\nwith certain accessories. The<br />\nconsumer-minded buyer would<br />\nask questions regarding the car's<br />\nefficiency and safety, such as:<br />\n\"If this car is in a 40-mile-anhour left front side collision, is<br />\nthe (steering) column going to<br />\nback into the driver, for an<br />\nimpromptu rendezvous?\"<br />\nNader believes that the<br />\nconsumer should have the option of asking for what he<br />\n<br />\nsome students consider to be<br />\ninequitably low buy-back rates<br />\nby explaining, \"We don't set<br />\nprices for used books. The<br />\nwholesale book company does.<br />\nWe just receive a commission. If<br />\nwe know a book will be required<br />\nfor a course offered the next<br />\nsemester on this campus, we can<br />\npay 50% of the new price for<br />\nit.\" He continued to say that the<br />\nstore could sell a lot more used<br />\nbooks if professors would submit their required reading lists<br />\non time, two and a half months<br />\nbefore the start of the semester.<br />\nDuval and his successor said<br />\nthey would follow up on a<br />\nnumber of suggestions made by<br />\ncommittee members, including<br />\nrunning more advertising both<br />\nfor used books and to remind<br />\nstudents of the deadline for<br />\nreturning new ones. They also<br />\nplan to expand the selection of<br />\ndrugstore items.<br />\nChairman Charles Peifer was<br />\npleased with the meeting. \"I<br />\nthink this was very productive,\"<br />\nhe said.

Because<br />\nof this, Chargaff observed, scientists really do not know what<br />\nthey are doing when they<br />\ntamper with DNA.<br />\nChargaff then criticized<br />\nseveral aspects of the \"full speed<br />\nahead\" philosophy of gene research, and of science in general.<br />\n\"Successes have not been overwhelming. A few trivial enzymes have been produced only,<br />\ndespite much noise,'.' he asserted. Later, answering 4 question<br />\non medical applications of gene<br />\ntechnology, he commented that<br />\n\"diseases are cured by accidents.<br />\nI would give cancer research to<br />\nbotanists.\"<br />\n<br />\n6r. Chargraff<br />\n\"On record,\" he continued,<br />\n\"I find gene technology is<br />\nextremely undesirable.\" First, it<br />\nexposes the environment to<br />\nthreats whose final results are<br />\nunpredictable.<br />\nFor example,<br />\nmany labs work with the bacterium E. coll. If altered strains<br />\nescaped and colonized, anything<br />\nfrom diarrhea to something<br />\nquite serious could occur,<br />\nChargaff warned.<br />\nMore importantly, Chargaff<br />\nobjected on moral grounds to<br />\nthe assertion that \"science can<br />\n\u2022 produce a better human. This<br />\n<br />\nimplies that we are faulty.<br />\nNature will take care of itself<br />\nwithout scientific help.\"<br />\n\"Eugenics (the attempted<br />\nimprovement of the human race)<br />\nhas the aroma of burning human<br />\nflesh,\" he said, referring to<br />\nHitler's regime. He especially<br />\ndisagreed with man's attempts to<br />\nestablish himself as the ultimate<br />\njudge of what is best.<br />\nChargaff then commented<br />\non the foolishness of his scientific colleagues, particularly mentioning a 1963 report Man & His<br />\nFuture in which a large number<br />\nof authorities \"gave free reign to<br />\ntheir imaginations.\" \"Man appeared as expendable as yeast or<br />\nE. coll.<br />\nIt will show later<br />\ngenerations to what level of<br />\nbarbarism we have stooped.<br />\nWould you trust our future to<br />\nsuch people\"<br />\nHe then criticized the size<br />\nof science today, calling it<br />\n\"overproduced,\" and claiming it<br />\nhas lured people into its study<br />\nand now cannot fulfill its<br />\npromises. \"The speed of discoveries tells us science is coming to<br />\nan end; it will soon be a stock<br />\nmarket of speculators, who<br />\ndon't know more than enough<br />\nto scratch the surface.\"<br />\nChargaff complained that<br />\nthe scientific political lobby is<br />\ntoo strong, and that society<br />\nmust create a climate in which<br />\n\"some things are ostracized\"<br />\nto slow science down. He sees<br />\nresearch grants as a \"form of<br />\nunemployment insurance.\"<br />\nPerhaps Chargaffs position<br />\nis best summed up by a statement he made during the talk:<br />\n\"I, for one, don't want to be<br />\nimproved.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f\\'01 T.11131:R 9, 1979<br />\n<br />\nI'<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.....\u2022.,-\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n'.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n......\u2022,\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022,\u2022\"I.<br />\n...Wil A....,....1..11,\u2022..,,<br />\nb,.<br />\n... .%,...,<br />\n<br />\n:<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\nThe Placement Bureau<br />\n<br />\n,,,,,<br />\n,,,<br />\n,,,,,<br />\n<br />\nINTERVIEWS<br />\nTHE PLACEMENT BUREAU<br />\nROOM 135, GARLAND HALL<br />\n11/12/79<br />\n11/12/79<br />\n11/13/79<br />\n11/14/79<br />\n1 1/14/79<br />\n11/15/79<br />\n11/16/79<br />\n11/16/79<br />\n1 1/19/79<br />\n11/19/79<br />\n1 1/19/79<br />\n1 1/20/79<br />\n1 1/21/79<br />\n11/26/79<br />\n11/26/79<br />\n11/27/79<br />\n11/27/79<br />\n11/28/79<br />\n11/28/79<br />\n1 1/29/79<br />\n11/30/79<br />\n11/30/79<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nam),ImmImm mmVmm)mmlmm mmlimmImmlmm mm)mn)<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nSPRING FAIR!<br />\nORIENTATION!<br />\n<br />\ni STUDENT ADVISING!<br />\n1<br />\n,<br />\n;<br />\n,<br />\nM!<br />\nOSIU<br />\nSYMP<br />\nMSE<br />\n,,,,.<br />\n.._<br />\n. r<br />\n,, \u2022 I, .... f._ i_<br />\n1<br />\nete,41-,\"io -<br />\n<br />\nScience Applications Incorporated<br />\nPace University Graduate School<br />\nIBM<br />\nNew York Law School<br />\nWestinghouse Electric Corporation<br />\nFederal Bureau of Investigation<br />\nMcDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. - Western Division<br />\nUniversity of Baltimore Law School<br />\nAR INC Research Corporation<br />\nConsortium for Graduate Study in Management<br />\nHRB Singer, Inc.<br />\nHRB Singer, Inc.<br />\nHouse Information Systems<br />\nColumbia Law School<br />\nDepartment of Commerce National Telecommunications Administration<br />\nApplied Physics Laboratory Johns Hopkins University<br />\nThe Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania - MBA<br />\nCentral Intelligence Agency<br />\nDept. of the Army - Harry Diamond Laboratories<br />\nOld Dominion Systems<br />\nII T Research Institute<br />\nUniversity of Massachusetts Graduate School of Engineering<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\ns....<br />\n<br />\n__-<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n-_--\u2022<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\n1r<br />\n<br />\n%,,.<br />\n<br />\n\u2014<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n,<br />\n,<br />\n,<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nay elate aitot2e, art\"Okian ittieJt.taieett<br />\ni (date 9'eek4ti nemed Office. gItteA/tdieutia :$<br />\n,#<br />\nteaeii4Ite141atandaiy,,iVo/teeyntice4 12th<br />\nt<br />\n#<br />\nlititioagh Ai&ty, eiVo/t2e/m/wt 1ah.<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\nIf you want<br />\ni to submit a topic and run the symposium, $i<br />\nsubmit a 100 word description to the<br />\ns S.C.

As a process, education often<br />\ndoesn't make the grade.<br />\nIn those days before we all started specializing, it<br />\nwas not so much for our aptitude for English or math<br />\nthat enabled us to learn better in one subject oi- another.<br />\nFrom class to class, year to year, and teacher to teacher,<br />\napproaches to the common goal of learning vary and the<br />\nstudent profits or suffers from this. I did not learn very<br />\nmuch about sociology from Mr. Witwicki, but I did<br />\nenjoy the field trips to the North End of Boston (the<br />\nItalian section) to study \"the dynamics of socialization<br />\nin an ethnic neighborhood\", drink cappucino, and<br />\nsample pizza at the European. Miss Hackett initiated<br />\nus into the ways of Algebra by sheer power of reputation, passed down in horrifying and unexaggerated<br />\nstories from our elders. She taught by rule and rote; my .<br />\nSister is four years older than I and when I hunted up her<br />\nnotebook I discovered that even the wording of the<br />\nprinciples had not changed. Miss Hackett would stride<br />\nup and down the aisles firing questions at her cowed<br />\nand alphabetized students. I knew that once Scott<br />\n'Meyers had folded'I had better be ready to produce the<br />\nisquare root of two to the 34th decimal place fast. I can<br />\nstill speil off memorized passages from chemistry class<br />\nabout dichlorodifluoromethane, the electromagnetic<br />\nspectrum and conduction, convection and radiation that<br />\nare utterly meaningless to me. All I remember is my awe<br />\nat my teacher, Mr. Kumm, who fascinated us all because<br />\nhe could put both hands on a static electricity machine<br />\nand grin gleefully as though he were getting his daily fix<br />\n\u2022<br />\nof 10,000 or so volts.<br />\nWhen I reminisce about my education,! see more<br />\nand more that I learned as much and as little as I did<br />\nlargely by chance. A lot of opportunities were wasted<br />\nby my teachers and myself, so that I wonder exactly<br />\nwhat could have been done to produce a higher and<br />\nmore consistent level of learning across a range of<br />\nsubjects, so that when I began to direct my own education, I could have a broader and more substantial base<br />\nupon which to draw.<br />\nOne answer to this problem is in the deceptively<br />\nunacademic-looking building across from the dorms at<br />\n3505 North Charles Street. What you might take for a<br />\nsmall apartment house or a large home is actually one of<br />\nthe leading educational research centers in the country.<br />\nIt is famous among such institutions for several reasons,<br />\nparticulaliry for its orientation to education as a social<br />\nprocess. Its small staff has a large goal; to produce<br />\nuseful knowledge on how changes in the social organization of schools can influence improtant student outcomes such as desegragation and equity of education.<br />\nFor the researchers atnd students at the Center<br />\nfor Social Organization of Schools, the study and<br />\nimprovement of education is the occupation of a lifetime. The staff works at once within two different<br />\nworlds: that of scholarly research and that of the<br />\nschool administrator. The methods of<br />\nteacher<br />\nthese researchers have earned them distinction and<br />\nrespect. The Center develops and experiments with<br />\nspecific ways to structure school systems, individual<br />\nschools and classes to produce a particular result such as<br />\nreduced delinquency, feelings of self-reliance and accomplishment, and better understanding and a broader<br />\nrange of learning for all children.<br />\nJoyce Epstein, director of the Program for<br />\nSchool Organization and a part-time assistant professor<br />\nof Social Relations, helps to characterize this unique<br />\nperspective of the Center. Psychologists look at educational improvement through individual learners. They<br />\ntry to change the attitudes of people. The Center uses<br />\nthe model of changes in social structure of schools to<br />\nprovide a surer and more direct means of promoting<br />\ndesired ends. She especially hopes that \"in the future,<br />\n<br />\nthe results of our efforts will be that teachers will be<br />\nable to choose a particular way of structuring classes to<br />\nproduce certain results..\"<br />\nThe Center was established in 1966 through the<br />\nefforts of Prof. James Coleman and Dr. Edward McDill<br />\nof the Social Relations Department at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nFaculty members with the expertise and inclination to<br />\nform a research center were granted federal funding by a<br />\npanel of distinguished educational experts. During its<br />\nearly years, the Center was staffed by educators and<br />\neducational researchers from the Univeristy. and it<br />\noperated out of a small room in the basement of McCoy<br />\nHall.<br />\nThe Center receives funds from the National<br />\nInstitute of Education channeled through the University.<br />\nOriginally, the largest grants were earmarked for the<br />\nstudy of whether schools should be desegragated and the<br />\ndevelopment of effective methods for doing so. The<br />\nfindings of the researchers influenced the decision of<br />\nmany states to implement bussing. The Center then<br />\nmoved away from desegregation for awhile and has<br />\nreturned to it as a major program of study only in the<br />\nlast few years. Its largest grants today are directed<br />\nfor the study of desegregation and of how to most<br />\neffectively organize schools to improve student achievement and interpersonal relations. McDill says that<br />\ntoday the Center is looking better than ever before.<br />\n\"We've had our ups and downs. But right now everything is looking up. Financially we're very well off and<br />\nour interests are becoming broader than ever before.\"<br />\nThe staff is larger today than it ever has been. It<br />\nconsists of about 25 educational researchers, pre and<br />\npost-doctoral students, and graduate and undergraduate<br />\n<br />\nwork-study students. The Center interacts with and<br />\naddresses the needs of three separate groups: researchers, educational policy makers and school administrators. To achieve its goals, the Center organizes its work<br />\ninto four programs, each of which concentrates on a<br />\nspecific class of desirable outcomes and a particular level<br />\nof educational structure or school organization.<br />\n(I)The Social Processes and Career Development<br />\nProgram primarily examines the structures of schools,<br />\nschools systems and the institutional connections<br />\nbetween levels of schooling. Its objective is to increase<br />\nthe knowledge of how such experiences influence<br />\nlong-term career outcomes, including educational and<br />\noccupationsl plans and attainments, and work satisfaction and earnings. One of the current projects of this<br />\nPrograrb is to discern race and sex differences in the<br />\nkinds of careers chosen as students to those actually<br />\nfollowed as adults.<br />\n(2)The Program of Studies in Delinquency<br />\nexamines school environments and experiences and<br />\nindividual characteristics in relation to in-school and<br />\nleter-life delinquency. One of its purposes is to develop<br />\n<br />\npractical knowledge about delinquent behavior that will<br />\nshow how school or educational experiences can contribute to or reduce such activity. Researchers in this<br />\nProgram are now redoing a federal study of \"safe\"<br />\nschools to correct its assumptions about the prevalence<br />\nof delinquency.<br />\n(3)The Program of Studies in School Desegregation looks at the extent of desegregation in education,<br />\nemployment and place of residence; identifies exclusionary processes which affect the opportunities of minorities; analyzes long-term effects of school desegregation<br />\non individual success in higher education and occupation; and develops and evaluates classroom structures to<br />\nproduce positive race relations and improved education<br />\nfor all students.<br />\nThe particular contribution of the Center to<br />\ndesegregation study has been in its focus on long-term<br />\n(10-20 years) outcomes of desegregation rather than<br />\nthe 2-3 months other educational researchers use in their<br />\nwork. One concern of this Program is what effect<br />\nattending desegregated school has on eventual college<br />\nenrollment, choice of school and grades acieved. Another recent study looks at racial difference in making<br />\nuse of informal personal networks to get jobs after<br />\ncollege.<br />\n(4)The School Organization Program examines<br />\nthe organizational structure of schools and classrooms<br />\nand designs prototypes of new organizational forms<br />\nthat will produce desired outcomes. Ongoing and<br />\nrecently-completed studies include whether written<br />\ncomments motivate students to learn More than letter<br />\ngrades do; the effects on learning of giving students<br />\ndecision-making power in terms of their work; and how<br />\nto make use of peer groups to improve learning.<br />\nEpstein, director, of this Program, describes her<br />\nparticular interest as the authority structure of classrooms. Some teachers maintain rigid control over their<br />\nclasses; others exert no control at all. She is concerned<br />\nwith studying the outcomes for students when teachers<br />\nmanifest various ranges of discipline over classes.<br />\nThe Center has established a reputation for itself<br />\nof a primary interest in research. Its staff utilizes all the<br />\ncommon tools of researchers and methods for dissemination of results. In their studies, researchers use national<br />\ndata banks or collect their own information. They<br />\npublish reports of their findings and distribute them to<br />\nother research institutions. Staff members attend and<br />\nconduct seminars with other experts in education and<br />\npublish reports in educational journals.<br />\nThough known for this emphasis on research, the<br />\nCenter also provides education policy makers with<br />\ninformation about issues such as school desegregation,<br />\nschool discipline and equality of.educational and occupational opportunities. Its staff studies both specific<br />\nplans for desegregation or delinquency prevention and<br />\nconducts basic research on trends in educational and<br />\noccupational segregation, the life of adolescents in<br />\nsociety and the reactions of students to the practices of<br />\nschools.<br />\nThe Center disseminates this information<br />\nthrough seminars and articles in non-technical educational publications.<br />\nIn the last two years and as part of its general<br />\nefforts at expansion. the Center had broadened its<br />\noriginally primarily research-oriented goals to concentrate on translating the results of educations( research into<br />\na practical form that teachers can implement directly in<br />\ntheir classrooms. Dr. James McPartland, co-director of<br />\nthe Center and part time associate professor of Social<br />\nRelations at Hopkins, approves of the change: \"A lot of<br />\neducational reforms have never been adopted because<br />\nthey are too expensive or too hard on teachers, or they<br />\nare in a form that teachers can't readily adapt. We want<br />\nto make the evidence convincing that a parxicular<br />\nresearch project works, and make it inexpensive and easy<br />\nfor teachers to use.\"<br />\nAssistant Director of the Center John Hollifeld<br />\ne3plains how this orientation to the immediate needs of<br />\nthe teacher began. \"We are now making a special effort<br />\nto make schools aware that the results of our research<br />\nexist and how to use them. We have only begun to<br />\nseriously disseminate results in the area in the last year,<br />\nduring a new period of growth. We give techniques<br />\nand detailed instruction on how to use them. We suggest<br />\nauxiliaty materials and brochures and organize workshops for teachers on using the techniques.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fIt was one of the most extensive and sticcessfill<br />\nresearch projects that the Center completed that brought<br />\nabout this attention to the practical needs of schools. It<br />\nprovided a practical example of how the Center examines and resolves an educational problem and of a prototype for structuring a classroom to produce a predictable<br />\nand desirable result. Student Team Learning began in<br />\n1973 with the observation of some researchers that peer<br />\ngroups are very important in schools. Other studies<br />\nshowed that rewarding groups of students affected peer<br />\nSome researchers suggested that<br />\ngroups relations.<br />\ncompetitive teams sttuctured as idsports would work in<br />\nclassrooms, and a long tradition of research in social<br />\npsychology showed that people working on a cooperative goal help each other do well and like and respect<br />\none another.<br />\nWhat remained was to develop a technique in<br />\nwhich team learning could be made practical and effective in the classroom. The project was piloted by<br />\nseveral researchers including Dr. Robert Slavin of the<br />\nCenter for Social Organization of Schools. Student<br />\nTeam Learning involves students working in small<br />\nIt consists of three techniques:<br />\nlearning teams.<br />\nTeams-GamesTournaments (TGT), Student Teams Achievement Divisions (STAD), and Jigsaw. All three are<br />\nstructured on the learning team, which consists of 4 to 5<br />\nboys and girls of different levels-of learning ability and<br />\nethnic backgrounds. The goal of Team Learning is to<br />\nencourage students to work in an organized setting to<br />\nacieve goals, to help one another learn and to learn how<br />\nto get along with classmates. All three methods have<br />\nproved effective in improving learning, particularly for<br />\nminority students and emotionally disturbed children.<br />\nThe promotional literature for Student Team<br />\nLearning described the project as a set of instructional<br />\ntechniques \"developed with the idea that when students<br />\nlearn in small, carefully structured learning teams and<br />\nare rewarded for working toward a common goal, they<br />\nhelp one another learn, gain in self esteem and feelings<br />\nof individual responsibily for their learning and increase<br />\nin respect for their classmates.\" Team Learning draws<br />\non the powerful motivating qualities characteristic of<br />\nsports teams.<br />\nIn TGT, students are assigned to learning teams<br />\nwith other students of similar ability. Children practice<br />\na particular lesson all week long, helping one another to<br />\nmaster the basic material. At the end of the week<br />\nthey compete with other teams in a tournament in<br />\nwhich they draw numbers and answer the questions<br />\nrandomly assigned to them. Individual scores are<br />\ncombined to make each team's scores, and the winning<br />\nteams are announced in a weekly class newsletter. Every<br />\nstudent, regardless of ability, has an equal chance to<br />\ncontribute high schores. A system called \"bumping\"<br />\nmoves high scorers to a higher table.<br />\nStudent Teams Achievement Division (STAD) is<br />\nlike TGT except that instead of playing tournament<br />\ngames, students take quizzes individually to demonstrate<br />\nwhat they have learned and to contribute to the scores<br />\nof their teams. TGT and STAD are used mostly to<br />\ndevelop basic skills such as language arts, mathematics<br />\nand reading vocabulary. Jigsaw helps children to<br />\ndevelop their ability to read and understand narrative<br />\nmaterials such as biographies and short stories. Each<br />\nbecomes an expert on a particular segment of the<br />\nreading assignment. Experts discuss their topics, exchange ideas and return to their teams to explain their<br />\ndiscoveries. To do well on the quiz, each student must<br />\nthoroughly understand the presentations of the experts.<br />\nThe proven effects of Student Team Learning<br />\ntechniques include increased learning of basic skills,<br />\npositive relations between students in desegregated<br />\nclassrooms, improved self-esteem and feelings of confidence, and feelings of responsiblity to others and to<br />\noneself to master the assigned material.<br />\n<br />\nSlavin suggests that \"the results of this research<br />\ndevelopment may be one answer to a major contemporary dilemma of schools and techniques that achieve the<br />\nhumanistic goals that were the focus of education in the<br />\n1960's as well as the basic skills learning goals now being<br />\nemphasized.\" Student Team Learning fits well with the<br />\naims of the School Organization Program of which it is a<br />\npart: it responds to the increasing demands from public<br />\nand political sources that schools demonstrate their<br />\npositive impact on student outcomes and that educators<br />\ndevelop more successful organizational arrangements to<br />\nmotivate students.<br />\nThe Center strives to make Team Learning<br />\navailable to teachers in as practical and inexpensive a<br />\nform as possible. It offers a manual with detailed<br />\ninstructions on how to use the techniques and sample<br />\ntest problems for $3.00. Supplementary manuals are<br />\navailable for particular subjects and for mainstreaming.<br />\nWork-study students develop curriculum materials on<br />\nlanguage arts, mathematics, nutrition and science, which<br />\nschools can purchase for $8.00. The Center offers a<br />\nfilmstrip and tape explaining the technique for a refundable $15.00 deposit. Staff members travel around the<br />\ncountry to conduct workshops for teachers on Team<br />\nLearning techniques.<br />\nOne great advantage to a project such as Student<br />\nTeam Learning for educational researchers is that while<br />\nthey study the practical application of basic techniques,<br />\nthe project itself generates new studies and developments in a variety of areas. Recent projects on Team<br />\nLearning include an effort to apply the techniques to<br />\ncomposttion writing, and the discovery that race relations improve significatly in a team-learning-structured<br />\nclassroom.<br />\nThe Center has recently begun an extensive study<br />\nof five kinds of classroom organization, including team<br />\nlearning techniques, in 25 schools in Philadelphia,<br />\ninvolving some 2500 students. The basic focus of the<br />\nstudy will be of the effectiveness on learning of emphasizing the amount of material covered vs. the in-depth<br />\nmastery of lessons. The researchers will look at the<br />\nresults of classroom organization techniques to determine which will increase interaction between races and<br />\nbetween boys and girls. They will also examine how<br />\nmuch time is spent on each task and how instructors use<br />\nthe time they have.<br />\nAt present, efforts to disseminate information<br />\nabout Team Learning to schools has resulted in orders<br />\nfor materials from nearly 1000 school districts and the<br />\nadoption of Team Learning techniques in many different<br />\nareas of the country. Teaming is a concrete, successful<br />\nexample of the assertion of Center researchers that you<br />\ncan structure a classroom or school to produce specific<br />\ndesirable results. It translates research effectively into<br />\npractical use. Epstein sees Team Learning as one of the<br />\n\"prototypes\" that the Center will develop from which<br />\nteachers will one day select when they want to produce<br />\na specific student outcome in their classrooms.<br />\nSome of the initial testing of Team Learning<br />\ntechniques was conducted in the Baltimore public school<br />\nsystem. The Center does most of its research in Baltimore, Prince George's and Howard Counties and in<br />\nother urban and suburban counties of Maryland. It<br />\nseems surprising that the Center is not better known.<br />\nA Baltimore junior high school teacher who has<br />\nbeen working with the Center for two years provided an<br />\nanswer. Jackie Gundy, a science instructor at Northern<br />\nParkway Junior Hgih, was one of the first teachers to<br />\nincorporate team learning techniques in her classroom.<br />\n\"I noticed the change from the beginning,\"she says. \"In<br />\nteams, black and white students who usually withdrew<br />\nfrom one another came together in teams, and began to<br />\nlike one another. They showed mutual concern and<br />\nmany improved in their grades. They said it was fun<br />\nstudying and working with someone instead of by<br />\n<br />\nDr. James McPardand, co-director of the Center:<br />\n\"We want to make it inexpensive and easy...\"<br />\n<br />\nthemselves.\"<br />\nMs. Gundy now serves as the only teacher on thel<br />\nNational Advisory Committee of the Center. The<br />\nCommittee suggests and comments upon research and,.<br />\ndevelopment activities and oversees the projects of the<br />\nCenter. She also conducts workshops on Team Learning<br />\nand is one of the most enthusiastic proponents of the<br />\nproject.<br />\nShe says that the Baltimore public school system<br />\nis little by little becoming aware of what the Center can<br />\ndo for them, particularly now that researchers are<br />\nactively trying to disseminate their work to teachers and<br />\nschool administrators, This year Northern Parkway<br />\nJunior High has adopted team learning techniques on a<br />\ngrand scale in English, Science, Mathematics, Home<br />\nEconomics, and Art. Gundy describes the reaction of<br />\nthe Superintendent of Schools when the Center first<br />\noffered its materials and services to Baltimore: \"He said,<br />\n'Finally, for the first time, the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nis doing something for the City of Baltimore.\"<br />\nBecause of a broad range of studies on different<br />\ntopics are conducted at the Center, its staff members<br />\ncould easily become so absorbed in their own particular<br />\nwork that they become oblivious to that of others<br />\naround them. This could result in duplication of efforts<br />\nor in wasting the valuable contributions that one learned<br />\nperson can make to the projects of another. The Center<br />\nconducts a weekly seminar in which researchers present<br />\nthe results, plans and problems of their current work.<br />\nThe purpose of the seminars is to make the staff aware<br />\nof each other's projects and to evoke discussions, questions, suggestions and general reactions to the research.<br />\nThe Center has a very comfortable, informal<br />\natmosphere that is immediately apparent. Epstein<br />\nattributes at least some of the cooperative spirit of the<br />\nstaff to the architecture of the building. The front<br />\noffice looks like a living room that has been converted<br />\ninto an office; the conference room features a long<br />\nwooden table, a large fireplace and works of modern<br />\nart. Offices are scattered at different levels off the main<br />\nstaircase. The place elicits a sense of expectation and<br />\nsuspense from visitors. While you are trying to figure<br />\nout whtre the person you are looking for has his office,<br />\nyou meet a lot of interesting people.<br />\nAll of the researchers seem to have their own<br />\n\"soapboxes,\" as Epstein calls them \u2014 particular areas in<br />\nwhich they are most interested, They bring many<br />\ndivergent perspectives to bear on the Center and its<br />\nprojects. Staff members also use their own personal<br />\ntalents in their work. Ho'Held writes a column for<br />\nToday's Education entitled \"Research Clues,\" which he<br />\ndescribes as part of his preoccupation with translating<br />\nthe results of research into terms teachers can immediately and effectively adopt. Chuck Beady, a Fellowship<br />\nScientist in the School Desegregation Program, is an<br />\nartist who has printed a book of cartoons. In a current<br />\nstudy at Hampstead Hill Junior High, the Center is<br />\ncomparing the traditional learning atmosphere of students competing with one another for high grades to a<br />\npilot program in which students are rewarded for significantly improving over their past achievements. The<br />\nawards issued will be certificates for \"Academic Superstar of the Week.\"<br />\nAt the Center for Social Organization for<br />\nSchools, educational research is a social process in the<br />\nfullest sense of the term. Through research and practical<br />\napplication and interpretation of its results, the Center<br />\nworks to make education a social process as it has never<br />\nbeen before. Student Team Learning is only one example of many projects that prove that structures of<br />\nclassrooms and schools can be engineered to produce<br />\nsuch results as desegregation and reduction of delinquency, and ultimately better and broader educational<br />\nexperiences for all. This is perhaps the most important<br />\neffect of the Center: by producing thought for schools,<br />\nit uses research to benefit people.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12 / No<br />\n<br />\n9, 1979<br />\n<br />\nGarretts ofEvergreen House<br />\na distance, is not especaially large for a When Garrett died, his son, T.

The musical<br />\nscore, composed and arranged by<br />\nChristopher Lobingier and Brown Benson, boasts seven musicians, playing<br />\npercussion, piano, cello, bass, flute,<br />\nclarinet, and violin and two conductors.<br />\nThough a full orchestra, an<br />\nensemble, or at least a piano or organ<br />\ntraditionally accompanied the showing of<br />\nsilent films in the 1920's, this is a rare<br />\nevent today. Silent movies today usually<br />\nincorporate background music into the<br />\nfilm, but this weekend's performance will<br />\nfeature live music, being both a movie<br />\nand a concert.<br />\nSynchronization of the music and<br />\nfilm must be precise, especially in scene<br />\nchanges which have to reflected by<br />\nsmooth transitions in the music. Because<br />\nMetropolis' original score no longer<br />\nsurvives, Lobingier and Benson adapted<br />\nclassical and contemporary music to the<br />\nmovie as well as added the original<br />\nmaterial of their own composition.<br />\nThe film, made in Germany and<br />\ndirected by Fritz Lang, is the story of a<br />\ncity in the year 2000, in which the rich<br />\ncavort in \"pleasure gardens\" on the<br />\nsurface of the Earht while the workers<br />\ntend the underground machines which<br />\nrun the city.

When the master<br />\nof the Metropolis, John Frederson<br />\n(Alfred Abel), discovers the secret meetings, he sees them as the excuse to use<br />\nviolence against the workers.<br />\nOther characters in the film<br />\ninclude: Freder (Gustav Frolich), the son<br />\nof Frederson who rebels against his<br />\nfather's lifestyle and becomes a worker;<br />\nRotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), a mad<br />\ninventor who creates a robot that can<br />\nmore perfectly do the work now performed by human beings; and Maria<br />\n(Brigette Helm), the pacifist leader of the<br />\nworkers.<br />\nHelm and Abel turn in outstanding performances.

Eisenhower Symposium, Ralph Nader dealt with a<br />\nwide range of issues and launched a bitter attack of President<br />\nCarter.<br />\nNader characterized Carter<br />\n&amp;as a \"disaster\" as far as furthering the public interest was<br />\nconcerned, terming the President<br />\n5.1 a \"consumer fraud.\" He warned<br />\nthat the public should \"beware<br />\nof any candidate who drapes<br /><br />\nA'<br />\nConsumer advocate Ralph Nader<br /><br />\nNader Calls On Consumers<br />\nTo Demand Better Products<br />\nBY LINDSAY KAPLAN<br /><br />\nConsumer advocate Ralph<br />\nNader addressed a large audience<br />\nat yesterday's MSE Symposium<br />\non the need to develop a consumer perspective regarding technology. Opening his speech by<br />\nconsidering the problem of neglectful laws regarding auto<br />\nsafety, he used this issue, along<br />\nwith other examples, to explain<br />\nwhat exactly a consumer viewpoint is.<br />\nAlthough the tone of Nader's speech was humorously<br />\nironic throughout, his concern<br />\nfor the consumer in his relation<br />\nto technology was evident. For<br />\nexample, as a third-year law<br />\nstudent, Nader was told by his<br />\nprofessor that research of automobile safety was not worthwhile, because it did not reach<br /><br />\nthe \" 'level of complexity<br />\nsuitable to the intellectual pursuit' \". When Nader asked him<br />\nwhat subject was worthy of<br />\nserious study, \"the professor<br />\nreplied with a glow in his eye,<br />\n'Tax Law.'\"<br />\nNader's concern with the<br />\nproblems of automotive engineering stemmed from the fact<br />\nthat laws dealing with car<br />\ncollision were focused \"on the<br />\nhuman error in auto accidentsnot only for the (actual collision) but for what happens after<br />\nthe crash (i.e., any injuries<br />\nresulting from the design of the<br />\ncar).\" The emphasis on automotive design in the 50's (and still<br />\nto a great extent today) was on<br />\nthe appearance of the vehicle,<br />\nand not its safety. The fashionable tail fins of the 50's were<br />\naccepted by the public despite<br /><br />\nRent Control Decision<br />\nWill Affect Students<br />\nBY ANDREW HURLEY<br />\nAfter weeks of debate,<br />\nBaltimore citizens voted last<br />\nTuesday to support the rent<br />\ncontrol amendment to the city<br />\ncharter as Question K won a<br />\nfive-thousand-vote victory at the<br />\npolls. Of the 139,998 who voted<br />\n(representing 36% of the registered voters), almost 52% cast<br />\ntheir ballots in favor of the rent<br />\ncontrol amendment.<br />\nThe public supported the<br />\namendment despite the fact that<br />\n\"Keep Baltimore Best,\" the<br />\norganization that campaigned<br />\nagainst the proposal, outspent<br />\nthe supporters of Question K by<br />\na ratio of about 30 to one.<br />\nWith the approval of Question K, certain regulations will<br />\ngo into effect. A joint landlord-tenant commission will be<br />\ncreated to preside over permanent rent control in Baltimore.<br /><br />\nRents'will be rolled back to<br />\nlevels of between 4 and 6 per<br />\ncent more than they were in<br />\n1978. Another increase of between 4 and 7 per cent will<br />\nbe allowed beginning in January.<br />\nThe landlord-tenant commission,<br />\nmade up of two landlords, two<br />\ntenants and one homeowner,<br />\nwill decide future rent ceilings.<br />\nThe commission will also be<br />\nempowered to make exceptions<br />\nfor landlords who have to pay<br />\nextraordinarily high energy or<br />\nutility costs. The commission's<br />\npermission is required in order<br />\nfor a landlord to change the use<br />\nof his rental units.<br />\nThere is currently some<br />\nquestion as to the constitutional<br />\nvalidity of the amendment. In<br />\nthe near future, Supreme Judge<br />\nJoseph H.H. Kaplan will hear<br />\narguments in a case challenging<br />\nthe legality of the referendum<br />\ncont. on p. 3<br /><br />\nthe fact that the only purpose<br />\nwas \"to better hook the pedestrian with.\"<br />\nNader suggested that democracy be applied to technology;<br />\nthe consumer ought to question<br />\nwhy products are produced in<br />\nthe manner that they are. One<br />\nshould be able to ask for products that meet consumer demands of quality, and not have<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\ntheir religion around them, since<br />\nthey might be using it as a cloak<br />\nto hide something.\"<br />\nWhen asked to give his<br />\nopinion of other 1980 presidential candidates, Nader said Sen.<br />\nEdward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Gov. Jerry Brown of<br />\nCalifornia had little more to<br />\noffer. He added that to elicit any<br />\nresponse from candidates on the<br />\nissues of consumer protection,<br />\nvoters must organize.<br />\nNader said that the ideal<br />\npresidential candidate would recognize that as the leader of the<br />\nnation, he should recognize and<br />\nseek out \"the power of the<br />\npeople. You can't lead a citizenry which has beentripped of its<br />\npower.\" He commented that<br />\nCarter does not understand that<br />\na leader must \"call on an awakened citizenry.\" Nader blamed<br />\nthis unwillingness to listen to the<br />\npeople for the failure of several<br />\npro-consumer bills in Congress<br />\nwhen they faced \"corporate<br />\nopposition.\" Nader quoted a<br />\nfriend of Carter's as saying \"he<br />\ndoesn't learn easily, but he<br />\nlearns from his last mistake.\" He<br />\nalso said he has made many<br />\nsuggestions to the President<br /><br />\nwhich he has ignored.<br />\nNader was asked to define<br />\nthe public interest, and answered, \"Whatever the public thinks<br />\nis in their interest:\" He said it<br />\nshould maximize the good of the<br />\ngreatest number without jeapordizing the rights of others.<br />\nNader also spoke about rent<br />\ncontrol. He said that where there<br />\nwas rampant speculation and not<br />\nenough competition between<br />\nlandlords, it was necessary to<br />\nprotect the consumer. \"Rent<br />\ncontrol gives time to establish a<br />\nsystem which eliminates the<br />\nneed for rent control in the first<br />\nplace,\" he said. Nader added<br />\nthat rent control produces \"a<br />\nbreathing space, sometimes of<br />\nseveral years,\" in which to<br />\ncorrect a situation intolerable to<br />\nthe consumer.<br />\nNader was asked to express<br />\nhis feelings about the new<br />\nDepartment of Education. He<br />\nreplied, \"I don't have any<br />\nfeelings. You wanna ask me if I<br />\nhave any beliefs?\" He went on<br />\nto question whether the Department would make any difference at all, saying that only if<br />\n,it listened to the students as an<br />\ncont. on p. 3<br /><br />\nBook Center Gets Graded<br />\ndY MARK.TRACHTEN BERG<br />\n011 Tuesday, November 6,<br />\nthe Student Council Student<br />\nServices Committee, chaired by<br />\nCharles Peifer, met with officials<br />\nof the Hopkins Book Center to<br />\ndiscuss a wide variety of issues,<br />\nincluding store security, textbook prices, buy-back rates<br />\nfor used books and the Book<br />\nCenter's layout.

Dan<br />\nSnydacker, a member of the<br />\nGraduate Representative Organization who has been active with<br />\nthe issue, commented, \"I was<br />\npleased with the results of the<br />\nelection. It was a good vote and<br />\na meaningful vote. Even if it has<br />\nto be repealed, I think that it<br />\nwas a good step forward. It gives<br />\nBaltimore a chance to go even<br />\nfurther. I think that it will work<br />\nbut it requires an active faith<br />\nright now.\"<br />\nSnydacker went on to explain how students living in<br />\nUniversity-owned housing are<br />\nindirectly affected by the decision. Even though these apartments will not he subject to the<br />\nlaw, they will not be able to<br />\ncharge much higher prices than<br />\nother buildings in the immediate<br />\narea or students will rent the<br />\napartments with cheaper rates.<br />\nTherefore, if rents of nearby<br />\napartments<br />\ndecrease. Hopkins-owned apartments will most<br />\nlikely keep their prices at the<br />\nsame level.<br /><br />\nWhen asked for his reaction<br />\nto the decision, undergraduate<br />\nstudent Steve Menn said, \"I'm<br />\nvery pleased. Rent control is<br />\nneeded. I'm not crazy about<br />\ngovernment regulation\u2014they often screw things up\u2014but the<br />\nlandlords will certainly do so. I<br />\nhave<br />\nlived<br />\nmany<br />\nin<br />\nnon-rent-control areas and the<br />\nsituation was a mess.\"<br />\nSeveral students were not<br />\npleased with the outcome.<br />\nFreshman Demetrios Lefakis<br />\nsaid, \"It is a fundamental<br />\neconomic truth that rent control \u2022<br />\ncreates shortages in the supply<br />\nof housing and creates black<br />\nmarket tendencies. This means<br />\nthat some of us might not find a<br />\nplace to live next year and the<br />\nwhole equilibrium of the free<br />\nmarket will be upset.\"<br />\nOther students on campus<br />\nhave not decided whether or not<br />\nrent control is a good thing.<br />\nJohn Jove said, \"Rent control is<br />\ngood for us because we can't<br />\nas students afford to pay higher<br />\nrents.

If students<br />\ncould write to the Department<br />\nSecretary and ask about proposals, then Nader felt there would<br />\nbe some difference.<br />\nHe criticized the government's plan to bail out the<br />\nChrysler Corporation, saying<br />\n\"there isn't enough money in<br />\nthe Treasury to bail it out.\"<br />\nHe said Chrysler suffered from<br />\n\"very had management\" and<br />\nfailed to serve the consumer,<br />\nciting as examples the number of<br />\ncars recalled and the amount<br />\nof customer dissatisfaction with<br />\nChrysler products. He felt that<br />\nthis support was unfair to small<br />\nbusinesses since it implied that<br />\nthe government would only<br />\nassist a company in the event of<br />\nextensive mismanagement. He<br />\nrecommended that Chrysler find<br />\na buyer, \"take out a classified<br /><br />\nad,\" and pointed out that a<br />\ncontrolling interest could be had<br />\nfor one billion dollars.<br />\nNader attacked Detroit<br />\ncongressman John Dingel, a<br />\nmajor supporter of aid to<br />\nChrysler, as \"public interest<br />\nenemy number one\" because of<br />\nhis opposition to auto-emission<br />\ncontrols and mandatory passive<br />\nrestraint systems for cars.<br />\nNader said he supported the<br />\nderegulation of the trucking<br />\nindustry but said those who had<br />\nsupported airline deregulation<br />\nwould be sorry because of rising<br />\nprices and a decrease in safety<br />\ndue to the spread of commuter<br />\nairlines.

I<br />\nknow the Senior Class and the<br />\nWeekend Wonder Flix series<br />\nhave been having trouble about<br />\nselecting the same movies but<br />\nthis could easily be worked out.<br />\nWhat I do not like, is what<br />\nappears to me, to be an infiltration of an outside movie group<br />\nwho have been coming on<br />\ncampus more and more. It is<br /><br />\nnot that this group, the Baltimore Film Forum, is not doing a<br />\ngreat job, but they are openly<br />\ngoing against the regular movies<br />\non campus. They also recently<br />\ngot the use of MUDD HALL,<br />\nwhen nobody else could get it,<br />\nsomebody on campus is playing<br />\nfavorites - is it humanities?<br />\nDo you know that last week<br />\nin the Friday Morning Sun, in<br />\nthe Arts calendar part, the Film<br />\nForum not only listed their own<br />\nactivities separate under their<br />\nOWN NAME,- but managed to<br />\nget one of their shows listed<br />\nright in the middle of the<br />\nChaplain's movies, and it is<br />\nfunny, that show they listed is<br />\nopposite the silent movie,<br />\nMetropolis, at almost the very<br />\nsame hour.<br />\nFor the last two years<br />\npeople on campus who are<br />\nfriendly with the Film Forum<br />\npeople have been saying the<br />\nFilm Forum people intended to<br />\ntake over all the big movie<br />\nseries on campus; they said, the<br />\nForum thinks the only movie<br />\naudience in Baltimore is on the<br />\ncampus. (Some of the Film<br />\nForum people are mighty friendly with the Reel World people look out Chaplain Wickwire).<br />\nDid you also ever take a<br />\nclose look at the Film Forum<br />\ncalendar that they send out<br />\nevery few months? Did you ever<br />\nnotice how complete it is when<br />\nit comes to their own movies<br />\nand how incomplete the list is<br />\nwhen it comes to other people's<br />\nmovies? And so often, that list<br />\noffers incorrect information<br />\nabout other movies.<br />\nI think the film forum stuff<br />\nis fine in some ways and I think<br />\nthey shoud exist, but I don't like<br />\nthe way they are pushing around<br />\non campus, and I don't think<br />\nit is right that they get MUDD<br />\nHall when nobody else can get<br />\nit.<br />\nMichael Bloom<br /><br />\nMASTER OF SCIENCE<br />\nTRANSPORTATION<br />\nAT MIT<br />\nIN<br />\nThe new MASTER of SCIENCE DEGREE in<br />\nTRANSPORTATION is based on an interdisciplinary,<br />\nintermodal approach to transportation.

As a process, education often<br />\ndoesn't make the grade.<br />\nIn those days before we all started specializing, it<br />\nwas not so much for our aptitude for English or math<br />\nthat enabled us to learn better in one subject oi- another.<br />\nFrom class to class, year to year, and teacher to teacher,<br />\napproaches to the common goal of learning vary and the<br />\nstudent profits or suffers from this. I did not learn very<br />\nmuch about sociology from Mr. Witwicki, but I did<br />\nenjoy the field trips to the North End of Boston (the<br />\nItalian section) to study \"the dynamics of socialization<br />\nin an ethnic neighborhood\", drink cappucino, and<br />\nsample pizza at the European. Miss Hackett initiated<br />\nus into the ways of Algebra by sheer power of reputation, passed down in horrifying and unexaggerated<br />\nstories from our elders. She taught by rule and rote; my .<br />\nSister is four years older than I and when I hunted up her<br />\nnotebook I discovered that even the wording of the<br />\nprinciples had not changed. Miss Hackett would stride<br />\nup and down the aisles firing questions at her cowed<br />\nand alphabetized students. I knew that once Scott<br />\n'Meyers had folded'I had better be ready to produce the<br />\nisquare root of two to the 34th decimal place fast. I can<br />\nstill speil off memorized passages from chemistry class<br />\nabout dichlorodifluoromethane, the electromagnetic<br />\nspectrum and conduction, convection and radiation that<br />\nare utterly meaningless to me. All I remember is my awe<br />\nat my teacher, Mr. Kumm, who fascinated us all because<br />\nhe could put both hands on a static electricity machine<br />\nand grin gleefully as though he were getting his daily fix<br />\n\u2022<br />\nof 10,000 or so volts.<br />\nWhen I reminisce about my education,! see more<br />\nand more that I learned as much and as little as I did<br />\nlargely by chance. A lot of opportunities were wasted<br />\nby my teachers and myself, so that I wonder exactly<br />\nwhat could have been done to produce a higher and<br />\nmore consistent level of learning across a range of<br />\nsubjects, so that when I began to direct my own education, I could have a broader and more substantial base<br />\nupon which to draw.<br />\nOne answer to this problem is in the deceptively<br />\nunacademic-looking building across from the dorms at<br />\n3505 North Charles Street. What you might take for a<br />\nsmall apartment house or a large home is actually one of<br />\nthe leading educational research centers in the country.<br />\nIt is famous among such institutions for several reasons,<br />\nparticulaliry for its orientation to education as a social<br />\nprocess. Its small staff has a large goal; to produce<br />\nuseful knowledge on how changes in the social organization of schools can influence improtant student outcomes such as desegragation and equity of education.<br />\nFor the researchers atnd students at the Center<br />\nfor Social Organization of Schools, the study and<br />\nimprovement of education is the occupation of a lifetime. The staff works at once within two different<br />\nworlds: that of scholarly research and that of the<br />\nschool administrator. The methods of<br />\nteacher<br />\nthese researchers have earned them distinction and<br />\nrespect. The Center develops and experiments with<br />\nspecific ways to structure school systems, individual<br />\nschools and classes to produce a particular result such as<br />\nreduced delinquency, feelings of self-reliance and accomplishment, and better understanding and a broader<br />\nrange of learning for all children.<br />\nJoyce Epstein, director of the Program for<br />\nSchool Organization and a part-time assistant professor<br />\nof Social Relations, helps to characterize this unique<br />\nperspective of the Center. Psychologists look at educational improvement through individual learners. They<br />\ntry to change the attitudes of people. The Center uses<br />\nthe model of changes in social structure of schools to<br />\nprovide a surer and more direct means of promoting<br />\ndesired ends. She especially hopes that \"in the future,<br /><br />\nthe results of our efforts will be that teachers will be<br />\nable to choose a particular way of structuring classes to<br />\nproduce certain results..\"<br />\nThe Center was established in 1966 through the<br />\nefforts of Prof. James Coleman and Dr. Edward McDill<br />\nof the Social Relations Department at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nFaculty members with the expertise and inclination to<br />\nform a research center were granted federal funding by a<br />\npanel of distinguished educational experts. During its<br />\nearly years, the Center was staffed by educators and<br />\neducational researchers from the Univeristy. and it<br />\noperated out of a small room in the basement of McCoy<br />\nHall.<br />\nThe Center receives funds from the National<br />\nInstitute of Education channeled through the University.<br />\nOriginally, the largest grants were earmarked for the<br />\nstudy of whether schools should be desegragated and the<br />\ndevelopment of effective methods for doing so. The<br />\nfindings of the researchers influenced the decision of<br />\nmany states to implement bussing. The Center then<br />\nmoved away from desegregation for awhile and has<br />\nreturned to it as a major program of study only in the<br />\nlast few years. Its largest grants today are directed<br />\nfor the study of desegregation and of how to most<br />\neffectively organize schools to improve student achievement and interpersonal relations. McDill says that<br />\ntoday the Center is looking better than ever before.<br />\n\"We've had our ups and downs. But right now everything is looking up. Financially we're very well off and<br />\nour interests are becoming broader than ever before.\"<br />\nThe staff is larger today than it ever has been. It<br />\nconsists of about 25 educational researchers, pre and<br />\npost-doctoral students, and graduate and undergraduate<br /><br />\nwork-study students. The Center interacts with and<br />\naddresses the needs of three separate groups: researchers, educational policy makers and school administrators. To achieve its goals, the Center organizes its work<br />\ninto four programs, each of which concentrates on a<br />\nspecific class of desirable outcomes and a particular level<br />\nof educational structure or school organization.<br />\n(I)The Social Processes and Career Development<br />\nProgram primarily examines the structures of schools,<br />\nschools systems and the institutional connections<br />\nbetween levels of schooling. Its objective is to increase<br />\nthe knowledge of how such experiences influence<br />\nlong-term career outcomes, including educational and<br />\noccupationsl plans and attainments, and work satisfaction and earnings. One of the current projects of this<br />\nPrograrb is to discern race and sex differences in the<br />\nkinds of careers chosen as students to those actually<br />\nfollowed as adults.<br />\n(2)The Program of Studies in Delinquency<br />\nexamines school environments and experiences and<br />\nindividual characteristics in relation to in-school and<br />\nleter-life delinquency. One of its purposes is to develop<br /><br />\npractical knowledge about delinquent behavior that will<br />\nshow how school or educational experiences can contribute to or reduce such activity. Researchers in this<br />\nProgram are now redoing a federal study of \"safe\"<br />\nschools to correct its assumptions about the prevalence<br />\nof delinquency.<br />\n(3)The Program of Studies in School Desegregation looks at the extent of desegregation in education,<br />\nemployment and place of residence; identifies exclusionary processes which affect the opportunities of minorities; analyzes long-term effects of school desegregation<br />\non individual success in higher education and occupation; and develops and evaluates classroom structures to<br />\nproduce positive race relations and improved education<br />\nfor all students.<br />\nThe particular contribution of the Center to<br />\ndesegregation study has been in its focus on long-term<br />\n(10-20 years) outcomes of desegregation rather than<br />\nthe 2-3 months other educational researchers use in their<br />\nwork. One concern of this Program is what effect<br />\nattending desegregated school has on eventual college<br />\nenrollment, choice of school and grades acieved. Another recent study looks at racial difference in making<br />\nuse of informal personal networks to get jobs after<br />\ncollege.<br />\n(4)The School Organization Program examines<br />\nthe organizational structure of schools and classrooms<br />\nand designs prototypes of new organizational forms<br />\nthat will produce desired outcomes. Ongoing and<br />\nrecently-completed studies include whether written<br />\ncomments motivate students to learn More than letter<br />\ngrades do; the effects on learning of giving students<br />\ndecision-making power in terms of their work; and how<br />\nto make use of peer groups to improve learning.<br />\nEpstein, director, of this Program, describes her<br />\nparticular interest as the authority structure of classrooms. Some teachers maintain rigid control over their<br />\nclasses; others exert no control at all. She is concerned<br />\nwith studying the outcomes for students when teachers<br />\nmanifest various ranges of discipline over classes.<br />\nThe Center has established a reputation for itself<br />\nof a primary interest in research. Its staff utilizes all the<br />\ncommon tools of researchers and methods for dissemination of results. In their studies, researchers use national<br />\ndata banks or collect their own information. They<br />\npublish reports of their findings and distribute them to<br />\nother research institutions. Staff members attend and<br />\nconduct seminars with other experts in education and<br />\npublish reports in educational journals.<br />\nThough known for this emphasis on research, the<br />\nCenter also provides education policy makers with<br />\ninformation about issues such as school desegregation,<br />\nschool discipline and equality of.educational and occupational opportunities. Its staff studies both specific<br />\nplans for desegregation or delinquency prevention and<br />\nconducts basic research on trends in educational and<br />\noccupational segregation, the life of adolescents in<br />\nsociety and the reactions of students to the practices of<br />\nschools.<br />\nThe Center disseminates this information<br />\nthrough seminars and articles in non-technical educational publications.<br />\nIn the last two years and as part of its general<br />\nefforts at expansion. the Center had broadened its<br />\noriginally primarily research-oriented goals to concentrate on translating the results of educations( research into<br />\na practical form that teachers can implement directly in<br />\ntheir classrooms. Dr. James McPartland, co-director of<br />\nthe Center and part time associate professor of Social<br />\nRelations at Hopkins, approves of the change: \"A lot of<br />\neducational reforms have never been adopted because<br />\nthey are too expensive or too hard on teachers, or they<br />\nare in a form that teachers can't readily adapt. We want<br />\nto make the evidence convincing that a parxicular<br />\nresearch project works, and make it inexpensive and easy<br />\nfor teachers to use.\"<br />\nAssistant Director of the Center John Hollifeld<br />\ne3plains how this orientation to the immediate needs of<br />\nthe teacher began. \"We are now making a special effort<br />\nto make schools aware that the results of our research<br />\nexist and how to use them. We have only begun to<br />\nseriously disseminate results in the area in the last year,<br />\nduring a new period of growth. We give techniques<br />\nand detailed instruction on how to use them. We suggest<br />\nauxiliaty materials and brochures and organize workshops for teachers on using the techniques.\"<br /><br />\nIt was one of the most extensive and sticcessfill<br />\nresearch projects that the Center completed that brought<br />\nabout this attention to the practical needs of schools. It<br />\nprovided a practical example of how the Center examines and resolves an educational problem and of a prototype for structuring a classroom to produce a predictable<br />\nand desirable result. Student Team Learning began in<br />\n1973 with the observation of some researchers that peer<br />\ngroups are very important in schools. Other studies<br />\nshowed that rewarding groups of students affected peer<br />\nSome researchers suggested that<br />\ngroups relations.<br />\ncompetitive teams sttuctured as idsports would work in<br />\nclassrooms, and a long tradition of research in social<br />\npsychology showed that people working on a cooperative goal help each other do well and like and respect<br />\none another.<br />\nWhat remained was to develop a technique in<br />\nwhich team learning could be made practical and effective in the classroom. The project was piloted by<br />\nseveral researchers including Dr. Robert Slavin of the<br />\nCenter for Social Organization of Schools. Student<br />\nTeam Learning involves students working in small<br />\nIt consists of three techniques:<br />\nlearning teams.<br />\nTeams-GamesTournaments (TGT), Student Teams Achievement Divisions (STAD), and Jigsaw. All three are<br />\nstructured on the learning team, which consists of 4 to 5<br />\nboys and girls of different levels-of learning ability and<br />\nethnic backgrounds. The goal of Team Learning is to<br />\nencourage students to work in an organized setting to<br />\nacieve goals, to help one another learn and to learn how<br />\nto get along with classmates. All three methods have<br />\nproved effective in improving learning, particularly for<br />\nminority students and emotionally disturbed children.<br />\nThe promotional literature for Student Team<br />\nLearning described the project as a set of instructional<br />\ntechniques \"developed with the idea that when students<br />\nlearn in small, carefully structured learning teams and<br />\nare rewarded for working toward a common goal, they<br />\nhelp one another learn, gain in self esteem and feelings<br />\nof individual responsibily for their learning and increase<br />\nin respect for their classmates.\" Team Learning draws<br />\non the powerful motivating qualities characteristic of<br />\nsports teams.<br />\nIn TGT, students are assigned to learning teams<br />\nwith other students of similar ability. Children practice<br />\na particular lesson all week long, helping one another to<br />\nmaster the basic material. At the end of the week<br />\nthey compete with other teams in a tournament in<br />\nwhich they draw numbers and answer the questions<br />\nrandomly assigned to them. Individual scores are<br />\ncombined to make each team's scores, and the winning<br />\nteams are announced in a weekly class newsletter. Every<br />\nstudent, regardless of ability, has an equal chance to<br />\ncontribute high schores. A system called \"bumping\"<br />\nmoves high scorers to a higher table.<br />\nStudent Teams Achievement Division (STAD) is<br />\nlike TGT except that instead of playing tournament<br />\ngames, students take quizzes individually to demonstrate<br />\nwhat they have learned and to contribute to the scores<br />\nof their teams. TGT and STAD are used mostly to<br />\ndevelop basic skills such as language arts, mathematics<br />\nand reading vocabulary. Jigsaw helps children to<br />\ndevelop their ability to read and understand narrative<br />\nmaterials such as biographies and short stories. Each<br />\nbecomes an expert on a particular segment of the<br />\nreading assignment. Experts discuss their topics, exchange ideas and return to their teams to explain their<br />\ndiscoveries. To do well on the quiz, each student must<br />\nthoroughly understand the presentations of the experts.<br />\nThe proven effects of Student Team Learning<br />\ntechniques include increased learning of basic skills,<br />\npositive relations between students in desegregated<br />\nclassrooms, improved self-esteem and feelings of confidence, and feelings of responsiblity to others and to<br />\noneself to master the assigned material.<br /><br />\nSlavin suggests that \"the results of this research<br />\ndevelopment may be one answer to a major contemporary dilemma of schools and techniques that achieve the<br />\nhumanistic goals that were the focus of education in the<br />\n1960's as well as the basic skills learning goals now being<br />\nemphasized.\" Student Team Learning fits well with the<br />\naims of the School Organization Program of which it is a<br />\npart: it responds to the increasing demands from public<br />\nand political sources that schools demonstrate their<br />\npositive impact on student outcomes and that educators<br />\ndevelop more successful organizational arrangements to<br />\nmotivate students.<br />\nThe Center strives to make Team Learning<br />\navailable to teachers in as practical and inexpensive a<br />\nform as possible. It offers a manual with detailed<br />\ninstructions on how to use the techniques and sample<br />\ntest problems for $3.00. Supplementary manuals are<br />\navailable for particular subjects and for mainstreaming.<br />\nWork-study students develop curriculum materials on<br />\nlanguage arts, mathematics, nutrition and science, which<br />\nschools can purchase for $8.00. The Center offers a<br />\nfilmstrip and tape explaining the technique for a refundable $15.00 deposit. Staff members travel around the<br />\ncountry to conduct workshops for teachers on Team<br />\nLearning techniques.<br />\nOne great advantage to a project such as Student<br />\nTeam Learning for educational researchers is that while<br />\nthey study the practical application of basic techniques,<br />\nthe project itself generates new studies and developments in a variety of areas. Recent projects on Team<br />\nLearning include an effort to apply the techniques to<br />\ncomposttion writing, and the discovery that race relations improve significatly in a team-learning-structured<br />\nclassroom.<br />\nThe Center has recently begun an extensive study<br />\nof five kinds of classroom organization, including team<br />\nlearning techniques, in 25 schools in Philadelphia,<br />\ninvolving some 2500 students. The basic focus of the<br />\nstudy will be of the effectiveness on learning of emphasizing the amount of material covered vs. the in-depth<br />\nmastery of lessons. The researchers will look at the<br />\nresults of classroom organization techniques to determine which will increase interaction between races and<br />\nbetween boys and girls. They will also examine how<br />\nmuch time is spent on each task and how instructors use<br />\nthe time they have.<br />\nAt present, efforts to disseminate information<br />\nabout Team Learning to schools has resulted in orders<br />\nfor materials from nearly 1000 school districts and the<br />\nadoption of Team Learning techniques in many different<br />\nareas of the country. Teaming is a concrete, successful<br />\nexample of the assertion of Center researchers that you<br />\ncan structure a classroom or school to produce specific<br />\ndesirable results. It translates research effectively into<br />\npractical use. Epstein sees Team Learning as one of the<br />\n\"prototypes\" that the Center will develop from which<br />\nteachers will one day select when they want to produce<br />\na specific student outcome in their classrooms.<br />\nSome of the initial testing of Team Learning<br />\ntechniques was conducted in the Baltimore public school<br />\nsystem. The Center does most of its research in Baltimore, Prince George's and Howard Counties and in<br />\nother urban and suburban counties of Maryland. It<br />\nseems surprising that the Center is not better known.<br />\nA Baltimore junior high school teacher who has<br />\nbeen working with the Center for two years provided an<br />\nanswer. Jackie Gundy, a science instructor at Northern<br />\nParkway Junior Hgih, was one of the first teachers to<br />\nincorporate team learning techniques in her classroom.<br />\n\"I noticed the change from the beginning,\"she says. \"In<br />\nteams, black and white students who usually withdrew<br />\nfrom one another came together in teams, and began to<br />\nlike one another. They showed mutual concern and<br />\nmany improved in their grades. They said it was fun<br />\nstudying and working with someone instead of by<br /><br />\nDr. James McPardand, co-director of the Center:<br />\n\"We want to make it inexpensive and easy...\"<br /><br />\nthemselves.\"<br />\nMs. Gundy now serves as the only teacher on thel<br />\nNational Advisory Committee of the Center. The<br />\nCommittee suggests and comments upon research and,.<br />\ndevelopment activities and oversees the projects of the<br />\nCenter. She also conducts workshops on Team Learning<br />\nand is one of the most enthusiastic proponents of the<br />\nproject.<br />\nShe says that the Baltimore public school system<br />\nis little by little becoming aware of what the Center can<br />\ndo for them, particularly now that researchers are<br />\nactively trying to disseminate their work to teachers and<br />\nschool administrators, This year Northern Parkway<br />\nJunior High has adopted team learning techniques on a<br />\ngrand scale in English, Science, Mathematics, Home<br />\nEconomics, and Art. Gundy describes the reaction of<br />\nthe Superintendent of Schools when the Center first<br />\noffered its materials and services to Baltimore: \"He said,<br />\n'Finally, for the first time, the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nis doing something for the City of Baltimore.\"<br />\nBecause of a broad range of studies on different<br />\ntopics are conducted at the Center, its staff members<br />\ncould easily become so absorbed in their own particular<br />\nwork that they become oblivious to that of others<br />\naround them. This could result in duplication of efforts<br />\nor in wasting the valuable contributions that one learned<br />\nperson can make to the projects of another. The Center<br />\nconducts a weekly seminar in which researchers present<br />\nthe results, plans and problems of their current work.<br />\nThe purpose of the seminars is to make the staff aware<br />\nof each other's projects and to evoke discussions, questions, suggestions and general reactions to the research.<br />\nThe Center has a very comfortable, informal<br />\natmosphere that is immediately apparent. Epstein<br />\nattributes at least some of the cooperative spirit of the<br />\nstaff to the architecture of the building. The front<br />\noffice looks like a living room that has been converted<br />\ninto an office; the conference room features a long<br />\nwooden table, a large fireplace and works of modern<br />\nart. Offices are scattered at different levels off the main<br />\nstaircase. The place elicits a sense of expectation and<br />\nsuspense from visitors. While you are trying to figure<br />\nout whtre the person you are looking for has his office,<br />\nyou meet a lot of interesting people.<br />\nAll of the researchers seem to have their own<br />\n\"soapboxes,\" as Epstein calls them \u2014 particular areas in<br />\nwhich they are most interested, They bring many<br />\ndivergent perspectives to bear on the Center and its<br />\nprojects. Staff members also use their own personal<br />\ntalents in their work. Ho'Held writes a column for<br />\nToday's Education entitled \"Research Clues,\" which he<br />\ndescribes as part of his preoccupation with translating<br />\nthe results of research into terms teachers can immediately and effectively adopt. Chuck Beady, a Fellowship<br />\nScientist in the School Desegregation Program, is an<br />\nartist who has printed a book of cartoons. In a current<br />\nstudy at Hampstead Hill Junior High, the Center is<br />\ncomparing the traditional learning atmosphere of students competing with one another for high grades to a<br />\npilot program in which students are rewarded for significantly improving over their past achievements. The<br />\nawards issued will be certificates for \"Academic Superstar of the Week.\"<br />\nAt the Center for Social Organization for<br />\nSchools, educational research is a social process in the<br />\nfullest sense of the term. Through research and practical<br />\napplication and interpretation of its results, the Center<br />\nworks to make education a social process as it has never<br />\nbeen before. Student Team Learning is only one example of many projects that prove that structures of<br />\nclassrooms and schools can be engineered to produce<br />\nsuch results as desegregation and reduction of delinquency, and ultimately better and broader educational<br />\nexperiences for all. This is perhaps the most important<br />\neffect of the Center: by producing thought for schools,<br />\nit uses research to benefit people.<br /><br />\nPAGE 12 / No<br /><br />\n9, 1979<br /><br />\nGarretts ofEvergreen House<br />\na distance, is not especaially large for a When Garrett died, his son, T.

Kinephonic Ensemble, whose music<br />\nfor The Phantom of the Opera was a<br />\nsuccess last semester, will provide the<br />\nmusical accompaniment. The musical<br />\nscore, composed and arranged by<br />\nChristopher Lobingier and Brown Benson, boasts seven musicians, playing<br />\npercussion, piano, cello, bass, flute,<br />\nclarinet, and violin and two conductors.<br />\nThough a full orchestra, an<br />\nensemble, or at least a piano or organ<br />\ntraditionally accompanied the showing of<br />\nsilent films in the 1920's, this is a rare<br />\nevent today. Silent movies today usually<br />\nincorporate background music into the<br />\nfilm, but this weekend's performance will<br />\nfeature live music, being both a movie<br />\nand a concert.<br />\nSynchronization of the music and<br />\nfilm must be precise, especially in scene<br />\nchanges which have to reflected by<br />\nsmooth transitions in the music. Because<br />\nMetropolis' original score no longer<br />\nsurvives, Lobingier and Benson adapted<br />\nclassical and contemporary music to the<br />\nmovie as well as added the original<br />\nmaterial of their own composition.<br />\nThe film, made in Germany and<br />\ndirected by Fritz Lang, is the story of a<br />\ncity in the year 2000, in which the rich<br />\ncavort in \"pleasure gardens\" on the<br />\nsurface of the Earht while the workers<br />\ntend the underground machines which<br />\nrun the city. The workers live on the<br />\nthird level beneath the city and have<br />\nsecret meetings in the catacombs of an<br />\neven lower fourth level. When the master<br />\nof the Metropolis, John Frederson<br />\n(Alfred Abel), discovers the secret meetings, he sees them as the excuse to use<br />\nviolence against the workers.<br />\nOther characters in the film<br />\ninclude: Freder (Gustav Frolich), the son<br />\nof Frederson who rebels against his<br />\nfather's lifestyle and becomes a worker;<br />\nRotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), a mad<br />\ninventor who creates a robot that can<br />\nmore perfectly do the work now performed by human beings; and Maria<br />\n(Brigette Helm), the pacifist leader of the<br />\nworkers.<br />\nHelm and Abel turn in outstanding performances. The art deco sets and<br />\nspecial effects are also impressive. The<br />\n1979 audience should enjoy the 1926<br />\nfilm maker's vision of the year 2000.<br />\nPredictably, the buildings are tall and the<br />\namount of electricity used is exorbitant,<br />\nbut a biplane glides through one shot of<br />\nthe city and human error still louses up<br />\notherwise efficient machinery.<br />\nThere is a tendancy to get philosophical about the political implications<br />\nof the movie. It is hard to forget the slow,<br />\nheads-down plodding of the workers<br />\nmarching in formation.
