Mass campus<br />\nby Alex Boese, courtesy of<br />\nThe Amherst Student. Reprinted with permission.<br />\nWhile Amherst College faces unusually low<br />\nblack student enrollment, the University of<br />\nMassachusetts at Amherst has the highest<br />\npercentage of minorities ever, despite racial tensions there over the past two years.<br />\nLast October, UMass suffered the first of two<br />\nracial conflicts between its students when<br />\nfighting broke out following the World Series.<br />\nAs a result of the brawl, ten people were<br />\nhospitalized, including one black student who<br />\nhad been beaten unconscious.<br />\nIn the days immediately following the incident, the University seemed uncertain whether<br />\nor not to call the incident a racial event. Peter<br />\nO'Neil, a UMass spokesman, said at the time,<br />\n\"We don't think it was a racial incident....We<br />\nthink it was just a matter of Red Sox fans and<br />\nMets fans, some of whom were black and some<br />\nof whom were white.<br />\nWithin weeks the University administration<br />\nhad changed its position on this question. \"The<br />\nincident has in it a major element of race,\"<br />\nexplained Rick Townes, Special Assistant to the<br />\nVice Chancellor of Student Affairs at UMass.<br />\n<br />\nHe said that he doubted whether the fighting<br />\nwas<br />\ninitially<br />\nracially<br />\nmotivated, but once the action began \"it clearly had<br />\na racial dimension to it.\"<br />\nFive of the students involved in the incident<br />\nwere disciplined by the University. Three of<br />\nthese five were suspended for one year. The<br />\nother two were placed on deferred suspension,<br />\nallowing them to attend the University, although<br />\ndenying them the privileges of being on an<br />\nathletic team or running for student office. They<br />\nare also under threat of expulsion should they<br />\ncommit another offense.<br />\nThe Dean of Students Office received<br />\ncriticism for its actions during this situation.<br />\nFrederick A. Hurst, a commissioner for the<br />\nCommission<br />\nMassachusetts<br />\nAgainst<br />\nDiscrimination(MCAD), after investigating the<br />\nincident, issued a report in which he said,<br />\n\"They missed the opportunity to stand up and<br />\npublicly declare the events of the evening to the<br />\nmedia and the entire UMass community and to<br />\ntell all that quick action would be taken.\"<br />\nOn May 15 fighting again broke out at<br />\nUMass. It occurred at 1:30 a.m. at a party outside the Theta Chi house on 496 North Pleasant Street. The incident involved a conflict between three black student and members of the<br />\n<br />\nTheta Chi fraternity. After a brief conversation<br />\nthe black students left the party, but as they<br />\nwere leaving, a fraternity member threw a brick<br />\nat the departing car. No one was injured in the<br />\naccident.<br />\nJay Spamer, president of the local chapter of<br />\nTheta Chi, said in a recent interview that the<br />\nthree black individuals were seen urinating in<br />\na brother's car. \"When asked to leave, they<br />\nrefused, \"he said. \"And that is when the incident occurred.\"<br />\nSpamer claimed that it was not a racial incident. \"With the police...all racial charges have<br />\nbeen dropped. The press has gotten hold of it<br />\nand made it a racial conflict, but it wasn't,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\n\"We have a large number of minorities,\"<br />\nhe added, \"so why would we be hostile to<br />\nthem?\"<br />\nThe black students involved in the incident<br />\ndeny the claims made against them. In their support, the police, when investigating the event<br />\nthe next morning, found no trace of urine on<br />\nthe car in question.<br />\nSpamer said, \"Eight people saw three black<br />\nindividuals with their pants down around a<br />\ncar. . .They were also sexually harassing a<br />\nfemale.\"<br />\n<br />\nAt the suggestion of the national fraternity<br />\nthe University has presented probation<br />\nguidelines to the local chapter of Theta Chi for<br />\ntheir approval. However, these guidelines are<br />\nonly in response to alcohol violations.<br />\n\"We are allowing the national fraternity to<br />\nstep in,\"said Townes. \"No University action<br />\nis being taken for racial violations.\"<br />\nTownes explained that because of the stark<br />\ndisagreement between the parties involved, no<br />\ndetermination is being made as to whether or<br />\nnot it was a racial violation. He said that the<br />\nUniversity is supporting what the national<br />\nfraternity has suggested.<br />\nThe student responsible for throwing the<br />\nbrick is being treated as an individual, not as<br />\na part of the fraternity, Townes explained. He<br />\nwill be allowed to attend the University this fall<br />\nif he wishes.<br />\nIn response to the administration's actions,<br />\nSpamer said, \"The University is trying to make<br />\nan example of us. We are a victim of the system<br />\nright now.\" However, he said that he felt that<br />\nthe University was \"being fair to an extent.\"<br />\nHe clarified that the fraternity is being<br />\nreprimanded only with respect to alcohol violations. \"We charged at the door, which is illegal,<br />\n\" he noted.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\n1.'14+4444044++<br />\n41+++++++++++4,4.4\u20224.4+4:*++++4,++++++4\u20224404.4446**,<br />\n41<br />\n11.<br />\n41<br />\nti.<br />\n41<br />\n11.<br />\n41<br />\n11.<br />\n41li\u2022<br />\n41<br />\n11.<br />\n11TION<br />\n41<br />\n.41<br />\n11.<br />\nMING<br />\n11.<br />\n41<br />\n11.<br />\n4:<br />\n*<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n1141<br />\n11.<br />\n41<br />\nit<br />\n1141<br />\n+<br />\n4'<br />\n+<br />\n41<br />\n11.<br />\n41<br />\nti.<br />\n41<br />\nII.<br />\n4<br />\nli\u2022<br />\n41<br />\n*<br />\n41<br />\n41li.<br />\n1/<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Council<br />\nThe Inter-Fraternity Council<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\nProudly Present<br />\n<br />\n4.<br />\n4.<br />\n<br />\nVLI1 Vif`C<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\nFL2t<br />\n<br />\n11.<br />\nli\u2022<br />\nsi.<br />\n11.<br />\n11.<br />\n11.<br />\n<br />\nii.<br />\n+<br />\nii.<br />\n+<br />\nii.<br />\nti.<br />\nii.<br />\n<br />\nSunday, October 11, 1987<br />\n1-7 p.m. Gilman Quad<br />\n<br />\n+<br />\n+<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n+<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n4:<br />\n+<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\n.i..1.<br />\n<br />\n.<\\/<br />\n<br />\n11*<br />\nli.<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\noe<br />\n<br />\n\\\\<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nIT<br />\nti.<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nii.<br />\n<br />\n+<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\n//4<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nI*<br />\n<br />\n$ Featuring:<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n+<br />\n<br />\n+<br />\n<br />\nLittle Women<br />\nStudent Bands Opening<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n+ Serving:<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\n+<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n4: FREE<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\n43<br />\n<br />\n\u201417?<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n11.<br />\nli.<br />\n1111.<br />\niii.<br />\n13-<br />\n<br />\nHamburgers, Hot Dogs, Steamed Crabs<br />\n<br />\n111111.<br />\n<br />\n\u00f7<br />\nIii.<br />\niii.<br />\nIF<br />\n<br />\nsi,<br />\n:I.<br />\n11.<br />\n11.<br />\n<br />\n4.<br />\n<br />\n11.<br />\n*<br />\n13.<br />\n<br />\nSODA<br />\n4.<br />\n11.<br />\nvalid<br />\nI.D.<br />\n4<br />\n.<br />\nOther refreshments served with<br />\n%<br />\n11.<br />\n<br />\n4ii.<br />\n11.eati .1\"teriromyke*.4.;-:4-1,40444***flogkitt.e14*-ig.oktivvosrtiratliw.ieetbeibfirbefb+++++4\u2022ripit.4:41\u202246**<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\n\f6/OCTOBER 9, 1987<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNewsoLetter<br />\nFocusing on Freedom<br />\nThe members of the Coalition for a Free<br />\nSouth Africa have yet again spoken out on an<br />\nissue of seemingly little concern for them. Last<br />\nweek, the Coalition chose to attend the meeting<br />\nof the Urban Affairs Committee of the<br />\nBaltimore City Council at which it was proposed that Gilman Hall be declared an architectural and historical landmark. A Coalition<br />\nrepresentative argued against the University's<br />\nrequest that Gilman not be given landmark<br />\nstatus; the representative said that the University is \"grossly mismanaged\" and that the administration \"isn't to be trusted.\"<br />\nAlthough the Coalition has every right to attend meetings such as this, their place there is<br />\nquestionable. Their arguments, weak at best,<br />\nsuggest no real concern or commitment for the<br />\nfate of Gilman. The Coalition's attendance at<br />\nlast week's City Council Committee meeting<br />\nseems to have been nothing more than an attempt to stir up controversy and gain some attention for itself.<br />\nNow the Coalition has taken on the cause of<br />\nTerry Corbett, the APL photographer who was<br />\nfired for refusing to photograph protestors at<br />\nthe Lab. Although this issue has little to do with<br />\nthe interests and concerns of students at<br />\nHomewood, the Coalition has managed to<br />\nsmear it all over campus.<br />\nIt is entirely possible, however, that the<br />\nCoalition has done the entire Hopkins community a favor, for this is an issue which treads<br />\nthe fine borders of freedom of expression.<br />\nAlthough the Coalition argues that it is Corbett's freedom of speech which is being repressed, the situation forces us to look more closely at the role and rights of the protestors<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nTerry Corbett certainly meant well when he<br />\nrefused to photograph protestors if he honestly believed those photos to be potentially incriminating. However, Corbett knew of the<br />\nAPL's security efforts. Yet he continued to<br />\nwork there, simply refusing the direct responsibility of photographing.<br />\nIt is not clearly understood why Corbett<br />\n<br />\nwould want to continue to work for an organization whose actions so clearly contradicted his<br />\nown ethical beliefs. But since Corbett was consistently unable to fulfill his duties for ethical<br />\nreasons, it is understandable why the APL had<br />\nno choice but to relieve him of his job.<br />\nA more complex issue, though, is whether<br />\nCorbett's objections were justified. Those who<br />\nchoose to demonstrate publicly must give up<br />\na certain amount of privacy when they do so.<br />\nThe APL demonstrators are no exception. Their<br />\nprotests can be seen and heard by anyone<br />\naround; hence, it is entirely reasonable that they<br />\nbe photographed.<br />\nFurthermore, as APL spokesman Edward<br />\nCochran said, there was nothing at all covert<br />\nabout the photographing. It is,a common procedure for the APL, and is used mainly for their<br />\nown security purposes. Although there are those<br />\nwho disagree with the work of the APL, the<br />\nLab has every right to maintain as tight a security system as possible. If APL administrators<br />\nbelieve that protestors are potentially disruptive, then every effort should be made to protect their grounds and building. If the protestors<br />\ndo not like this, then they should not protest<br />\nin such a manner.<br />\nCorbett believes that the photographs were<br />\nbeing sent to other law enforcement officials.<br />\nHe has not shown any proof of this; however,<br />\nsuch methods have been used\u2014even at Homewood. Last year, certain Coalition members<br />\nhad had newspaper clippings about their<br />\npolitical activity added to their financial aid<br />\nfiles. Such articles and photos have no place<br />\nin such files, and Coalition members had reason<br />\nto be concerned.<br />\nBut the taking of photographs for security<br />\nreasons is certainly not a repression of freedom<br />\nof expression. Neither is Corbett's being fired,<br />\nas the Coalition contends. The right to protest<br />\nis not being forfeited; it is a certain degree of<br />\nprivacy that is lost. And that is simply a<br />\nsacrifice which those who feel strongly about<br />\ncertain issues must take.<br />\n<br />\nBreaking for the Fall<br />\nIn Fall Break's short existence, the<br />\nHomewood community has tried to make the<br />\nmost of the free Monday in October. The day<br />\noff is a welcome opportunity for much needed<br />\nrelaxation. It lends itself to social programming of some sort, although the degree to which<br />\nthis should occur has remained in question.<br />\nHomewood celebrated its first Fall Break only two years ago. A weekend-long schedule of<br />\nactivities was devised in a laudable, albeit financially risky, attempt to lay the ground work for<br />\na Fall term Spring Fair. It was regarded, at least<br />\nby those responsible for its organization, as a<br />\nmajor attempt to approve the atmosphere at<br />\nHomewood\u2014particularly addressing a generally dreary first semester.<br />\n\"Wild West Weekend\", as the Break was<br />\ndubbed, was nonetheless a failure. Attendance<br />\nwas abysmal. Students had been given the opportunity to go home and had apparently done<br />\njust that.<br />\nLast year, acting upon either reflection or<br />\nreaction to the previous Fall Break, no activities<br />\nwere scheduled for the weekend. Those<br />\nstudents who remained and hoped to relax faced<br />\na vapid weekend at Homewood. This year<br />\nthe Fall Festival seems to have found the happy medium between the philosophical extremes<br />\nof the previous years. With its live music, food,<br />\nrefreshments (including beer for those eligible)<br />\nand free admission, this Sunday promises to be<br />\nenjoyable.<br />\nFor the future, Fall Festival can and should<br />\nbe judged on how well it entertains the students<br />\nwho remain on campus, regardless of what<br />\npercentage of the student body goes away for<br />\n<br />\nthe weekend.<br />\nHowever, despite social programming at<br />\nHomewood, many students will not receive the<br />\nmental relaxation for which the day off was intended. Upcoming tests on and/or papers due<br />\nTuesday following Break will be necessarily<br />\nweighing heavily on their minds and their<br />\nschedules. These troubles can effectively kill<br />\nwhatever opportunity to relax the extra day<br />\noffers.<br />\nTests should be scheduled and papers assigned with greater sensitivity to vacations. This<br />\nwould enable students to better relax, an activity so crucial to health and well-being.<br />\nThis sensitivity regarding vacations would<br />\nalso be well suited to carry over to such events<br />\nas religious holidays; the individual deserves<br />\ntime unimpinged by the pressures of their<br />\nstudies to at least partake in the holiest days of<br />\ntheir religion.<br />\nPresently, there are professors on an individual basis who are mindful of a calendar<br />\nbeyond Homewood's. Often, however, this is<br />\ndue to a convergence of their priorities with<br />\nstudents' rather than a concern for these<br />\nstudents.<br />\nObviously it would be impossible to pay heed<br />\nto all legitimate personal concerns. Even to address the most popular would be,difficult, given<br />\nthe full academic calendar. It is, nevertheless,<br />\nthe responsibility of all faculty to account for<br />\nthe mental well-being of the student. The<br />\nrelatively small sacrifice involved with<br />\nrescheduling exams would produce tremendous<br />\ngains.<br />\n<br />\nThe ethics board:<br />\nsome weaknesses<br />\nDuring my four years at efficient.<br />\nHopkins, our ethics system has<br />\nThe Board's other function is<br />\nnever been discussed in great to hear cases of alleged honor<br />\ndetail by the University com- violations through hearing panels<br />\nmunity.

It has two<br />\nprimary functions, the first being<br />\nto periodically revise its Constitution. This is the Board's main<br />\nproject for the coming months.<br />\nLast week, we approved two<br />\nspecific motions to increase the<br />\nnumber of panel members to ten<br />\nstudents and six faculty members<br />\nand to clarify a student's rights of<br />\nappeal. At this writing, the provisions are now before the Student Council and Academic<br />\nCouncil for approval. The Board<br />\napproved these two specific<br />\nchanges in order to alleviate<br />\nseveral problems which had occurred in recent months, the most<br />\nnotable being member unavailability for hearing panels. In<br />\nthe coming months, we hope to<br />\nrevise the entire Constitution in<br />\norder to make the existing ethics<br />\nsystem more consistent and<br />\n<br />\npresented and hearing from both<br />\nthe faculty member and student<br />\ninvolved, the panel will determine guilt or innocence. Four<br />\n\"guilty\" votes are necessary for<br />\na conviction.<br />\nI have encountered several<br />\nmisconceptions concerning the<br />\nhearing panels. Some students<br />\nview the Board as a \"hanging<br />\njudge.\" This is definitely not<br />\ntrue. All Board members understand the serious consequences a<br />\nguilty verdict entails and would<br />\nnever enter a conviction if there<br />\nwas a persisting question of innocence. Although going before<br />\na hearing panel may be a trying<br />\nexperience for an accused student, the Board's hearing procedures ensure fairness.<br />\nAnother misconception is that<br />\na student will get a stiffer penalty if he or she goes before a hearing panel and is found guilty<br />\nrather than if the student simply<br />\nsettles the case with the individual<br />\n<br />\nSee ETHICS, 8<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nFlory Ware, Lisa Weisbord<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nDiana Zeiger<br />\nEly Brown, Jonathan Engler<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jon Stempel<br />\nLoren Fox<br />\nSharon Fischman, Jay Lechtman<br />\nJoseph Gergyes, Volney Sheen<br />\nVandana Kumra<br />\nDanny Kofos, Christopher Szeles<br />\nAnn Ginsberg<br />\nRichard Bell, Bernard Liu<br />\n<br />\nEditors<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nProduction Manager<br />\nLayout Editors<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nArts Editor<br />\nFeatures Editors<br />\nScience Editors<br />\nBooks Editor<br />\nSports Editors<br />\nCopy Editor<br />\nPhoto Editors<br />\n<br />\nStaff Writers: Robert Angervine, Eric Blumenfeld, P.

Though I may not instigate them, they do seem to<br />\nfollow me wherever I go.<br />\nSo how can you piss off your<br />\nroommate? Well, a good idea is<br />\nto visit everyone you know, and<br />\nborrow every battery powered<br />\nalarm clock you can find. At least<br />\neight are necessary. When your<br />\nroommate is away, set the alarms<br />\nat twenty minute intervals starting<br />\nat 2:30 a.m. and stash them<br />\neverywhere: in the ceiling tiles,<br />\nunder his bed, behind some<br />\nclothes.

Two points of<br />\nconsideration are obvious upon<br />\nexamination of the apparent<br />\n\"scandal\" in admissions ratios<br />\nrevealed by the first letter of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nFirst, suppose for example (a<br />\npurely hypothetical one) we have<br />\na school with 100 places. Assuming typical Hopkins applicant-toacceptance ratios, we have 200<br />\napplicants for the class. If 15% of<br />\nthe applicants are black, 7%<br />\nAsian, 5% Hispanic, and 5%<br />\nJewish, we would have 2 applicants per percentage point.

The percentage of<br />\nblacks nationwide, and thus in the<br />\napplicant pool, is not the same as<br />\nthe percentage of that ethnic<br />\nderivation in Baltimore.<br />\nOne<br />\npoint is<br />\nreadily<br />\nconceded\u2014 that women make up<br />\n40% of the applicant pool and only 33% of the students. The simple fact may be that 55% of the<br />\nmale applicants and only 41% of<br />\nthe female applicants are<br />\nqua;ified\u2014 this would lead to the<br />\ndiscrepancy between applications<br />\nand admissions percentages.<br />\nMuch as this is lamentable (and<br />\nI'm sure that you can find many<br />\nfreshmen who would gladly trade<br />\ntheir roommates' place in the<br />\nclass for a female of the same major), it is unfortunately a plausible truth. It may be convenient to<br />\ndistrust automatically and<br />\nauthority, but it may not be entirely sane.<br />\nI will patiently await accusations of being a sexist, a racist,<br />\nand a bigot. Anyone who knows<br />\nme knows that is untrue. As for<br />\nthose who prefer to ignore the<br />\nfacts of a world in which the<br />\nrealities of admission break down<br />\nnot into questions of ethnic<br />\nrepresentation but individual<br />\nqualification, you are free to do<br />\nso.

When you have to write a<br />\ncolumn every week, you quickly<br />\nrun out of themes and ideas. So,<br />\nif the article is due at 5 p.m. on<br />\nTuesday, you spend all of Monday evening asking your roommates if they have any ideas that<br />\nyou can use. They are polite, but<br />\nthey are in fact trying to study,<br />\nand are getting quite annoyed<br />\nwith you. Finally, just to shut you<br />\nup, one roommate says, \"Just do<br />\na damn column on pissing off<br />\nyour roommates while they're<br />\ntrying to study!!\" And there it is.<br />\nThis week's theme.

I'm<br />\ngiving a factual representation of<br />\nevents. My freshman year, I accidentally broke my roommate's<br />\n$20.00 bottle of Pierre Cardin<br />\ncologne. I won't mention his<br />\nname, because I promised I never<br />\nwould again after last year's Best<br />\nStudy Place column, but use your<br />\nimagination. Anyway, he was<br />\nreally annoyed, and still asks me<br />\nat least once a month when I'm<br />\ngoing to pay him for it. After XMas, he came back with a new<br />\nbottle and the caveat that if I<br />\nbroke this one my life would be<br />\nendangered. So one night we on<br />\nthe hall spilled the tiniest bit of his<br />\nnew cologne on the -floor, broke<br />\nan ARA glass on the floor with<br />\nit, and among the shards placed<br />\nthe top of his new bottle. When<br />\nhe came back, his face turned<br />\nlivid red. We told him that, who<br />\nelse, of course, but Jim Clancy<br />\nhad been playing with it and had<br />\ndropped it. He stormed off and<br />\npounded on Clancy's door.<br />\nLuckily Jim wasn't home. Boy<br />\nwas he pissed off when we told<br />\nhim it was just a joke.<br />\nAlthough I was not the cause of<br />\nit, I came into the largest roommate war ever my sophomore<br />\nyear.

The fraternities have a<br />\nvery positive force, or at least a<br />\nvery positive potential force, and<br />\ncan serve as a vehicle for a great<br />\ndeal of University input and effort. You would affect at least<br />\n30% of the student body and all<br />\nthose who come into contact with<br />\nthe system. The University<br />\nrecognizes that fraternities are a<br />\nfocal point and are committed to<br />\nhelping us.\"<br />\nTo that end, the University and<br />\nthe IFC hope to \"address the concerns of the fraternities through<br />\neducation and assistance in the<br />\nhope that such measures may<br />\neliminate the need for strong<br />\ndisciplinary action.\" Perhaps the<br />\ngreatest example of such<br />\n<br />\nRichard A.

As such,<br />\nthe University administration, the<br />\nInter-Fraternity Council, and the<br />\nfraternities themselves are concentrating efforts on building<br />\ncommunity relations, and<br />\nstrengthening the fraternity<br />\nsystem as a whole.

Billed as \"An<br />\nAmerican Musical,\" the<br />\nBroadway-bound show opened at<br />\nthe Morris A. Mechanic Theatre<br />\nSeptember 29 to a very enthusiastic audience.<br />\nThe story is loosely based on<br />\nthe lives of President Teddy<br />\nRoosevelt (Len Cariou) and his<br />\nteen-aged daughter, Alice (Nancy Hume). Alice, Teddy's<br />\ndaughter by his first wife and one<br />\ntrue love Alice Lee, is \"coming<br />\nout.\" She challenges social standards by engaging in such lewd<br />\nactivities as smoking in public,<br />\ndriving a car, and wearing a blue<br />\ndress to her coming-out party<br />\nNeedless to say everybody is<br />\ncharmed and appalled by this<br />\nclearly unconservative behavior<br />\nfrom the daughter of such a fine<br />\nupstanding world leader. When<br />\nshe finally lands a man\u2014a balding<br />\n35 year-old congressman (Ron<br />\nRaines)\u2014and looks like she is<br />\n<br />\nabout to settle down, all of<br />\nAmerica breathes a sigh of relief.<br />\nAll, that is, except for Daddy<br />\nTeddy, who is not so anxious to<br />\nlet the last reminder of his first<br />\nwife marry and leave him. This<br />\npersonal conflict is heightened by<br />\nthe fact that Teddy is up for<br />\nreelection. . .and the media and<br />\nthe GOP (his very own party)<br />\npredict his defeat.<br />\nSet shortly after the turn of the<br />\ncentury, this musical longs for the<br />\ngood ol' days, when men were<br />\nmen, women knew their places<br />\nand musicals portrayed an idyllic<br />\nfantasy world where the biggest<br />\ndanger for the characters is that<br />\nmaybe the lovers will have to<br />\nelope and forgo the family blessings. Teddy and Alice springs<br />\nfrom a different inspiration than<br />\nmany recent Broadway successes.<br />\nSuch hits as Hair, West Side<br />\nStory, A Chorus Line, and La<br />\nCage Aux Folles reflects a cynical<br />\nrealism which has characterized<br />\nMusical Theatre in the past few<br />\ndecades.<br />\nPeople who complain \"They<br />\ndon't make 'em like they used to\"<br />\nwon't have much to say about<br />\n<br />\nTeddy and Alice. This musical<br />\nstrictly conforms to the old standards. In fact, the creators seem<br />\nto have followed the recipe to a<br />\ntee. Take one heroine, add one<br />\nbig strong man, gradually blend<br />\nin adverse circumstances until no<br />\nlonger visible.<br />\nThose who crave the familiar<br />\nwill enjoy the music as well. John<br />\nPhilip \"three cheers for the red,<br />\nwhite and blue\" Sousa is responsible for the music to which Hal<br />\nHackady has devised lyrics. The<br />\nfamous march \"Stars and Stripes<br />\nForever\" makes its grand appearance at the end of the first act<br />\nfollowing a rousing speech by<br />\nTeddy in front of GOP headquarters. This speech was probably drawn from Theodore<br />\nRoosevelt's real repertoire; no<br />\nwriter in the 1980's would have<br />\ndared compose it. Keepers such<br />\nas \"People say I'm jingoistic,<br />\nwell maybe I am . . . and what's<br />\nwrong with that, jingoism's not a<br />\nbad word\" and \"My country 'tis<br />\nof thee\u2014American is my country\" abound.

What<br />\nthey all had in common was<br />\nmotivation, in addition to a lot of<br />\ngrunts and groans. \"I love the<br />\nsounds you make!\" exclaims<br />\nMarilyn Byers, director of the<br />\ngroup, and a well-known<br />\nchoreographer. Regardless of the<br />\npain, the group seemed happy,<br />\nwith some of the tension eased by<br />\nByers' witty remarks, and supportive pep talks by veteran<br />\ndancers.<br />\nFor experienced as well as<br />\nnovice dancers, the Hopkins<br />\nDance Company meets every<br />\nTuesday, and occasional Sundays, in random places<br />\nthroughout the Homewood campus. The next rehearsal will be<br />\nnext Tuesday at 6:30 in the Glass<br />\nPavilion, and usually runs for<br />\nabout two hours.

Alternating between<br />\ncliches and frightening realism, it<br />\nmanages to grip you where it<br />\nhurts. The story follows Alex<br />\nForrester (Glenn Close), an<br />\neditor in New York and a<br />\nschizophrenic, who has a twonight stand with happily married<br />\nDan<br />\nGallagher (Michael<br />\nDouglas). Alex, who, ironically,<br />\nlives next to the meat market,<br />\nbecomes increasingly obsessed<br />\nwith Dan, who sees the affair as<br />\na momentary weakness. She<br />\nforces herself into his life, following him constantly. Dan is<br />\npowerless is front of his guilt: he<br />\nhas a beautiful wife and darling<br />\ndaughter that he does not want to<br />\nlose. Alex's obsession becomes<br />\nmore and more destructive, and<br />\ntakes violent turns, with a<br />\ngruesome end.<br />\n<br />\nClose's Alex is a lonely,<br />\npathetic creature on the one side,<br />\nan alarmingly destructive powerful woman on the other. Her<br />\ndown-turned eyes and her angled face seem to ba!ance her alternating roles. Douglas, (looking<br />\nold), is Dan, at first an undefined, vaguely funny character, then<br />\nbecoming strong and weak at the<br />\nsame time. Douglas balances the<br />\nconflicting emotions of shame,<br />\nbetrayal and anger. Anne Archer,<br />\nwho plays Dan's wife, is pure<br />\nsweetness and joy, but manages<br />\nto be genuine.<br />\nYes, but this is a frightening<br />\nmovie. Both Alex and Dan present themselves as victims of one<br />\nanother. We alternately identify<br />\nwith Alex's loneliness, or her<br />\nanger, and then with Dan's<br />\nfrustration and helplessness. We<br />\nfeel drawn to both characters and<br />\nthen to neither. Close magnifies<br />\nqualities that appear in all of us<br />\n(obsession, need for attention,<br />\ndrama) and terrifies us when we<br />\nsee ourselves in her psychotic<br />\nAlex.

A genre that can<br />\nencompass both the Sex Pistols<br />\nand Bon Jovi is wide ranging indeed, and it seems that some<br />\nthings are unfairly lumped off as<br />\nbeing Rock and Roll,'when they<br />\ndon't really deserve that<br />\nclassification. A good example of<br />\nthis would be Tom Waits.<br />\nNobody, including Tom Waits,<br />\nknows just exactly what he isavant-garde artist, chronicler of<br />\nthe seamy side, polyp-voiced<br />\nsinger-all of these things apply,<br />\nbut none of them are quite right.<br />\nThe same might be said of<br />\nWaits' music, which has always<br />\ndefied standards-this is the man,<br />\nwho, on one track of Swordfish<br />\nTrombones, smacked a two-byfour against a dresser to get just<br />\nthe right percussive effect. His<br />\nnew album, Frank's Wild Years,<br />\nis defined as `Un Operachi<br />\nRomantico'-that's what the label<br />\nsays, at least. It might be better<br />\ndescribed as a stage-play with one<br />\nhell of a soundtrack, because this<br />\nis like no opera I'ver ever heard.<br />\nFrank's Wild Years is the story of<br />\na guy who packs up his accordian<br />\nand decides to shake off the dust<br />\nof Rainville, in search of the good<br />\nlife at the top. In a way, I suppose this album is good opera,<br />\nbecause the music carries the<br />\nstory effectively without the stage<br />\nactions. From the maniac<br />\ndesperation of \"Hang on St.<br />\n<br />\nChristopher\" to the lost innocence of \"Innocent When You<br />\nDream\" each song encapsulates<br />\nthe action-when \"Straight to the<br />\nTop (Vegas)\" degenerates into a<br />\ndissonant mish-mash that turns<br />\ninto the opening of \"I'll Take<br />\nNew York,\" you know that<br />\nFrank's dream has crumbled and<br />\ndeteriorated right along with the<br />\nmusic. This is a hard albumWaits' style is dirty and rough,<br />\neach song sounding like it was<br />\nrecorded in a cheap dive<br />\nsomewhere. I'll bet the CD version even has hiss on it. But this<br />\nis fantastic, bluesy stuff, with guts<br />\nand passion. If you want to hear<br />\nthe kind of stuff that brought them<br />\ninto places like the Cotton Club<br />\nduring the speakeasy era, you<br />\nhave to pick up this album.<br />\nIf Waits is the hard edge of today's rock composers, then<br />\nWilliam Orbit might well represent the other extreme. Orbit is<br />\na composer/producer, with some<br />\nimpressive credits to his namehe has scored two films<br />\nHotshot),<br />\n(Youngblood.<br />\nand produced a number of big<br />\nnames-Sting, Stan Ridgeway,<br />\nand Belinda Carlisle, to name just<br />\na few. Orbit also had his own<br />\ngroup, Torch Song, which he<br />\nformed with his partner, Laurie<br />\nMayer. Orbit is Orbit's first independant project, and it pretty<br />\nmuch lives up to his track record.<br />\nFor this album, Orbit recruited<br />\nPeta Nikolich to be his rock diva,<br />\nand her high, clear tones are one<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Arts Calendar<br />\nFILM<br />\nThe Senior Class Film Series<br />\npresents The Postman Always<br />\nRings Twice.

Dr. Nickon<br />\nbrought a personal insight to the<br />\nsubject by relating an incident that<br />\noccurred in his lab nine years<br />\nago. He had hired a young,<br />\nposthighly-recommended<br />\ndoctoral student, and while on<br />\nsabbatical, Dr. Nickon left the<br />\nstudent in charge. When Dr.<br />\nNickon returned, the student told<br />\nhim that he would be taking a<br />\nshort vacation for minor surgery<br />\non his hand, and that the research<br />\nsummary of the previous six<br />\nmonths' work would be forthcoming. The short vacation<br />\nturned into a permanent one when<br />\nthe post-doc did not return, leaving behind unpaid bills and an<br />\nabandoned car.

Dr. Nickon emphasized<br />\nthat, although many people would<br />\nlike to believe that fraud does not<br />\nhappen here, Hopkins is not<br />\nimmune.<br />\nThe definition of fraud is important, because there are many<br />\n, subtle ways that fraud is<br />\nperpetrated, said Dr. Ruth Faden,<br />\nProfessor of Health Policy and<br />\n<br />\nManagement at the School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health. She<br />\ndefined fraud as \"intentional<br />\nfalsification of data, fabrication of<br />\ndata or results, plagiarism, or<br />\nmisconduct of research procedures as to bias results.\u2014 The<br />\nmost obvious example is forgery,<br />\nbut other subtleties, well known<br />\nin lab courses on campus, are also<br />\nfraudulent, according to Dr.<br />\nFaden. \"Trimming\" is the<br />\n\"smoothing of irregularities to<br />\nmake data look accurate,\" and<br />\n\"cooking\" is \"retaining only<br />\nresults that fit the hypothesis.\"<br />\nDr. Faden states that the line between negligence and fraud is a<br />\nfine one, especially in dealing<br />\nwith chief investigators in charge<br />\nof many projects,, who co-author<br />\nmany papers.

Here I was, a lonely<br />\nChicago Bears addict, not only<br />\nfeeling terrible that we were losing, but having to deal with the<br />\ntremendous egos of these Giants<br />\nfans. What to do?<br />\nThe game suddenly turned for<br />\nthe better. Mike Tomczak was<br />\nthrowing incredible passes<br />\neverywhere.

Every year they<br />\nlose the first game. They stink.\"<br />\nThat night was a positive experience for us all. Well, all<br />\nright, for me. The point is, it is<br />\ndifficult being a fan for a team<br />\nthat everyone seems t6 despise. I<br />\nneed a little sympathy here.

Mass campus<br />\nby Alex Boese, courtesy of<br />\nThe Amherst Student. Reprinted with permission.<br />\nWhile Amherst College faces unusually low<br />\nblack student enrollment, the University of<br />\nMassachusetts at Amherst has the highest<br />\npercentage of minorities ever, despite racial tensions there over the past two years.<br />\nLast October, UMass suffered the first of two<br />\nracial conflicts between its students when<br />\nfighting broke out following the World Series.<br />\nAs a result of the brawl, ten people were<br />\nhospitalized, including one black student who<br />\nhad been beaten unconscious.<br />\nIn the days immediately following the incident, the University seemed uncertain whether<br />\nor not to call the incident a racial event. Peter<br />\nO'Neil, a UMass spokesman, said at the time,<br />\n\"We don't think it was a racial incident....We<br />\nthink it was just a matter of Red Sox fans and<br />\nMets fans, some of whom were black and some<br />\nof whom were white.<br />\nWithin weeks the University administration<br />\nhad changed its position on this question. \"The<br />\nincident has in it a major element of race,\"<br />\nexplained Rick Townes, Special Assistant to the<br />\nVice Chancellor of Student Affairs at UMass.<br /><br />\nHe said that he doubted whether the fighting<br />\nwas<br />\ninitially<br />\nracially<br />\nmotivated, but once the action began \"it clearly had<br />\na racial dimension to it.\"<br />\nFive of the students involved in the incident<br />\nwere disciplined by the University. Three of<br />\nthese five were suspended for one year. The<br />\nother two were placed on deferred suspension,<br />\nallowing them to attend the University, although<br />\ndenying them the privileges of being on an<br />\nathletic team or running for student office. They<br />\nare also under threat of expulsion should they<br />\ncommit another offense.<br />\nThe Dean of Students Office received<br />\ncriticism for its actions during this situation.<br />\nFrederick A. Hurst, a commissioner for the<br />\nCommission<br />\nMassachusetts<br />\nAgainst<br />\nDiscrimination(MCAD), after investigating the<br />\nincident, issued a report in which he said,<br />\n\"They missed the opportunity to stand up and<br />\npublicly declare the events of the evening to the<br />\nmedia and the entire UMass community and to<br />\ntell all that quick action would be taken.\"<br />\nOn May 15 fighting again broke out at<br />\nUMass. It occurred at 1:30 a.m. at a party outside the Theta Chi house on 496 North Pleasant Street. The incident involved a conflict between three black student and members of the<br /><br />\nTheta Chi fraternity. After a brief conversation<br />\nthe black students left the party, but as they<br />\nwere leaving, a fraternity member threw a brick<br />\nat the departing car. No one was injured in the<br />\naccident.<br />\nJay Spamer, president of the local chapter of<br />\nTheta Chi, said in a recent interview that the<br />\nthree black individuals were seen urinating in<br />\na brother's car. \"When asked to leave, they<br />\nrefused, \"he said. \"And that is when the incident occurred.\"<br />\nSpamer claimed that it was not a racial incident. \"With the police...all racial charges have<br />\nbeen dropped. The press has gotten hold of it<br />\nand made it a racial conflict, but it wasn't,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\n\"We have a large number of minorities,\"<br />\nhe added, \"so why would we be hostile to<br />\nthem?\"<br />\nThe black students involved in the incident<br />\ndeny the claims made against them. In their support, the police, when investigating the event<br />\nthe next morning, found no trace of urine on<br />\nthe car in question.<br />\nSpamer said, \"Eight people saw three black<br />\nindividuals with their pants down around a<br />\ncar. . .They were also sexually harassing a<br />\nfemale.\"<br /><br />\nAt the suggestion of the national fraternity<br />\nthe University has presented probation<br />\nguidelines to the local chapter of Theta Chi for<br />\ntheir approval. However, these guidelines are<br />\nonly in response to alcohol violations.<br />\n\"We are allowing the national fraternity to<br />\nstep in,\"said Townes. \"No University action<br />\nis being taken for racial violations.\"<br />\nTownes explained that because of the stark<br />\ndisagreement between the parties involved, no<br />\ndetermination is being made as to whether or<br />\nnot it was a racial violation. He said that the<br />\nUniversity is supporting what the national<br />\nfraternity has suggested.<br />\nThe student responsible for throwing the<br />\nbrick is being treated as an individual, not as<br />\na part of the fraternity, Townes explained. He<br />\nwill be allowed to attend the University this fall<br />\nif he wishes.<br />\nIn response to the administration's actions,<br />\nSpamer said, \"The University is trying to make<br />\nan example of us. We are a victim of the system<br />\nright now.\" However, he said that he felt that<br />\nthe University was \"being fair to an extent.\"<br />\nHe clarified that the fraternity is being<br />\nreprimanded only with respect to alcohol violations. \"We charged at the door, which is illegal,<br />\n\" he noted.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/5<br /><br />\n1.'14+4444044++<br />\n41+++++++++++4,4.4\u20224.4+4:*++++4,++++++4\u20224404.4446**,<br />\n41<br />\n11.<br />\n41<br />\nti.<br />\n41<br />\n11.<br />\n41<br />\n11.<br />\n41li\u2022<br />\n41<br />\n11.<br />\n11TION<br />\n41<br />\n.41<br />\n11.<br />\nMING<br />\n11.<br />\n41<br />\n11.<br />\n4:<br />\n*<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n1141<br />\n11.<br />\n41<br />\nit<br />\n1141<br />\n+<br />\n4'<br />\n+<br />\n41<br />\n11.<br />\n41<br />\nti.<br />\n41<br />\nII.<br />\n4<br />\nli\u2022<br />\n41<br />\n*<br />\n41<br />\n41li.<br />\n1/<br />\n6<br /><br />\nThe Student Council<br />\nThe Inter-Fraternity Council<br />\nand<br /><br />\nProudly Present<br /><br />\n4.<br />\n4.<br /><br />\nVLI1 Vif`C<br /><br />\n41<br /><br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br /><br />\nFL2t<br /><br />\n11.<br />\nli\u2022<br />\nsi.<br />\n11.<br />\n11.<br />\n11.<br /><br />\nii.<br />\n+<br />\nii.<br />\n+<br />\nii.<br />\nti.<br />\nii.<br /><br />\nSunday, October 11, 1987<br />\n1-7 p.m. Gilman Quad<br /><br />\n+<br />\n+<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n+<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n4:<br />\n+<br />\n41<br />\n41<br /><br />\n.i..1.<br /><br />\n.&lt;\\/<br /><br />\n11*<br />\nli.<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\noe<br /><br />\n\\\\<br />\n.<br /><br />\nIT<br />\nti.<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nii.<br /><br />\n+<br />\n41<br />\n41<br /><br />\n41<br /><br />\n//4<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n41<br /><br />\n.<br />\nA<br /><br />\nI*<br /><br />\n$ Featuring:<br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n+<br /><br />\n+<br /><br />\nLittle Women<br />\nStudent Bands Opening<br /><br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n+ Serving:<br />\n41<br />\n41<br /><br />\n+<br /><br />\n41<br />\n41<br />\n4: FREE<br />\n41<br />\n41<br /><br />\n43<br /><br />\n\u201417?<br /><br />\n*<br />\n11.<br />\nli.<br />\n1111.<br />\niii.<br />\n13-<br /><br />\nHamburgers, Hot Dogs, Steamed Crabs<br /><br />\n111111.<br /><br />\n\u00f7<br />\nIii.<br />\niii.<br />\nIF<br /><br />\nsi,<br />\n:I.<br />\n11.<br />\n11.<br /><br />\n4.<br /><br />\n11.<br />\n*<br />\n13.<br /><br />\nSODA<br />\n4.<br />\n11.<br />\nvalid<br />\nI.D.<br />\n4<br />\n.<br />\nOther refreshments served with<br />\n%<br />\n11.<br /><br />\n4ii.<br />\n11.eati .1\"teriromyke*.4.;-:4-1,40444***flogkitt.e14*-ig.oktivvosrtiratliw.ieetbeibfirbefb+++++4\u2022ripit.4:41\u202246**<br /><br />\n41<br />\n41<br /><br />\n6/OCTOBER 9, 1987<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNewsoLetter<br />\nFocusing on Freedom<br />\nThe members of the Coalition for a Free<br />\nSouth Africa have yet again spoken out on an<br />\nissue of seemingly little concern for them. Last<br />\nweek, the Coalition chose to attend the meeting<br />\nof the Urban Affairs Committee of the<br />\nBaltimore City Council at which it was proposed that Gilman Hall be declared an architectural and historical landmark. A Coalition<br />\nrepresentative argued against the University's<br />\nrequest that Gilman not be given landmark<br />\nstatus; the representative said that the University is \"grossly mismanaged\" and that the administration \"isn't to be trusted.\"<br />\nAlthough the Coalition has every right to attend meetings such as this, their place there is<br />\nquestionable. Their arguments, weak at best,<br />\nsuggest no real concern or commitment for the<br />\nfate of Gilman. The Coalition's attendance at<br />\nlast week's City Council Committee meeting<br />\nseems to have been nothing more than an attempt to stir up controversy and gain some attention for itself.<br />\nNow the Coalition has taken on the cause of<br />\nTerry Corbett, the APL photographer who was<br />\nfired for refusing to photograph protestors at<br />\nthe Lab. Although this issue has little to do with<br />\nthe interests and concerns of students at<br />\nHomewood, the Coalition has managed to<br />\nsmear it all over campus.<br />\nIt is entirely possible, however, that the<br />\nCoalition has done the entire Hopkins community a favor, for this is an issue which treads<br />\nthe fine borders of freedom of expression.<br />\nAlthough the Coalition argues that it is Corbett's freedom of speech which is being repressed, the situation forces us to look more closely at the role and rights of the protestors<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nTerry Corbett certainly meant well when he<br />\nrefused to photograph protestors if he honestly believed those photos to be potentially incriminating. However, Corbett knew of the<br />\nAPL's security efforts. Yet he continued to<br />\nwork there, simply refusing the direct responsibility of photographing.<br />\nIt is not clearly understood why Corbett<br /><br />\nwould want to continue to work for an organization whose actions so clearly contradicted his<br />\nown ethical beliefs. But since Corbett was consistently unable to fulfill his duties for ethical<br />\nreasons, it is understandable why the APL had<br />\nno choice but to relieve him of his job.<br />\nA more complex issue, though, is whether<br />\nCorbett's objections were justified. Those who<br />\nchoose to demonstrate publicly must give up<br />\na certain amount of privacy when they do so.<br />\nThe APL demonstrators are no exception. Their<br />\nprotests can be seen and heard by anyone<br />\naround; hence, it is entirely reasonable that they<br />\nbe photographed.<br />\nFurthermore, as APL spokesman Edward<br />\nCochran said, there was nothing at all covert<br />\nabout the photographing. It is,a common procedure for the APL, and is used mainly for their<br />\nown security purposes. Although there are those<br />\nwho disagree with the work of the APL, the<br />\nLab has every right to maintain as tight a security system as possible. If APL administrators<br />\nbelieve that protestors are potentially disruptive, then every effort should be made to protect their grounds and building. If the protestors<br />\ndo not like this, then they should not protest<br />\nin such a manner.<br />\nCorbett believes that the photographs were<br />\nbeing sent to other law enforcement officials.<br />\nHe has not shown any proof of this; however,<br />\nsuch methods have been used\u2014even at Homewood. Last year, certain Coalition members<br />\nhad had newspaper clippings about their<br />\npolitical activity added to their financial aid<br />\nfiles. Such articles and photos have no place<br />\nin such files, and Coalition members had reason<br />\nto be concerned.<br />\nBut the taking of photographs for security<br />\nreasons is certainly not a repression of freedom<br />\nof expression. Neither is Corbett's being fired,<br />\nas the Coalition contends. The right to protest<br />\nis not being forfeited; it is a certain degree of<br />\nprivacy that is lost. And that is simply a<br />\nsacrifice which those who feel strongly about<br />\ncertain issues must take.<br /><br />\nBreaking for the Fall<br />\nIn Fall Break's short existence, the<br />\nHomewood community has tried to make the<br />\nmost of the free Monday in October. The day<br />\noff is a welcome opportunity for much needed<br />\nrelaxation. It lends itself to social programming of some sort, although the degree to which<br />\nthis should occur has remained in question.<br />\nHomewood celebrated its first Fall Break only two years ago. A weekend-long schedule of<br />\nactivities was devised in a laudable, albeit financially risky, attempt to lay the ground work for<br />\na Fall term Spring Fair. It was regarded, at least<br />\nby those responsible for its organization, as a<br />\nmajor attempt to approve the atmosphere at<br />\nHomewood\u2014particularly addressing a generally dreary first semester.<br />\n\"Wild West Weekend\", as the Break was<br />\ndubbed, was nonetheless a failure. Attendance<br />\nwas abysmal. Students had been given the opportunity to go home and had apparently done<br />\njust that.<br />\nLast year, acting upon either reflection or<br />\nreaction to the previous Fall Break, no activities<br />\nwere scheduled for the weekend. Those<br />\nstudents who remained and hoped to relax faced<br />\na vapid weekend at Homewood. This year<br />\nthe Fall Festival seems to have found the happy medium between the philosophical extremes<br />\nof the previous years. With its live music, food,<br />\nrefreshments (including beer for those eligible)<br />\nand free admission, this Sunday promises to be<br />\nenjoyable.<br />\nFor the future, Fall Festival can and should<br />\nbe judged on how well it entertains the students<br />\nwho remain on campus, regardless of what<br />\npercentage of the student body goes away for<br /><br />\nthe weekend.<br />\nHowever, despite social programming at<br />\nHomewood, many students will not receive the<br />\nmental relaxation for which the day off was intended. Upcoming tests on and/or papers due<br />\nTuesday following Break will be necessarily<br />\nweighing heavily on their minds and their<br />\nschedules. These troubles can effectively kill<br />\nwhatever opportunity to relax the extra day<br />\noffers.<br />\nTests should be scheduled and papers assigned with greater sensitivity to vacations. This<br />\nwould enable students to better relax, an activity so crucial to health and well-being.<br />\nThis sensitivity regarding vacations would<br />\nalso be well suited to carry over to such events<br />\nas religious holidays; the individual deserves<br />\ntime unimpinged by the pressures of their<br />\nstudies to at least partake in the holiest days of<br />\ntheir religion.<br />\nPresently, there are professors on an individual basis who are mindful of a calendar<br />\nbeyond Homewood's. Often, however, this is<br />\ndue to a convergence of their priorities with<br />\nstudents' rather than a concern for these<br />\nstudents.<br />\nObviously it would be impossible to pay heed<br />\nto all legitimate personal concerns. Even to address the most popular would be,difficult, given<br />\nthe full academic calendar. It is, nevertheless,<br />\nthe responsibility of all faculty to account for<br />\nthe mental well-being of the student. The<br />\nrelatively small sacrifice involved with<br />\nrescheduling exams would produce tremendous<br />\ngains.<br /><br />\nThe ethics board:<br />\nsome weaknesses<br />\nDuring my four years at efficient.<br />\nHopkins, our ethics system has<br />\nThe Board's other function is<br />\nnever been discussed in great to hear cases of alleged honor<br />\ndetail by the University com- violations through hearing panels<br />\nmunity.

It has two<br />\nprimary functions, the first being<br />\nto periodically revise its Constitution. This is the Board's main<br />\nproject for the coming months.<br />\nLast week, we approved two<br />\nspecific motions to increase the<br />\nnumber of panel members to ten<br />\nstudents and six faculty members<br />\nand to clarify a student's rights of<br />\nappeal. At this writing, the provisions are now before the Student Council and Academic<br />\nCouncil for approval. The Board<br />\napproved these two specific<br />\nchanges in order to alleviate<br />\nseveral problems which had occurred in recent months, the most<br />\nnotable being member unavailability for hearing panels. In<br />\nthe coming months, we hope to<br />\nrevise the entire Constitution in<br />\norder to make the existing ethics<br />\nsystem more consistent and<br /><br />\npresented and hearing from both<br />\nthe faculty member and student<br />\ninvolved, the panel will determine guilt or innocence.

Some students<br />\nview the Board as a \"hanging<br />\njudge.\" This is definitely not<br />\ntrue. All Board members understand the serious consequences a<br />\nguilty verdict entails and would<br />\nnever enter a conviction if there<br />\nwas a persisting question of innocence. Although going before<br />\na hearing panel may be a trying<br />\nexperience for an accused student, the Board's hearing procedures ensure fairness.<br />\nAnother misconception is that<br />\na student will get a stiffer penalty if he or she goes before a hearing panel and is found guilty<br />\nrather than if the student simply<br />\nsettles the case with the individual<br /><br />\nSee ETHICS, 8<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nFlory Ware, Lisa Weisbord<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nDiana Zeiger<br />\nEly Brown, Jonathan Engler<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jon Stempel<br />\nLoren Fox<br />\nSharon Fischman, Jay Lechtman<br />\nJoseph Gergyes, Volney Sheen<br />\nVandana Kumra<br />\nDanny Kofos, Christopher Szeles<br />\nAnn Ginsberg<br />\nRichard Bell, Bernard Liu<br /><br />\nEditors<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nProduction Manager<br />\nLayout Editors<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nArts Editor<br />\nFeatures Editors<br />\nScience Editors<br />\nBooks Editor<br />\nSports Editors<br />\nCopy Editor<br />\nPhoto Editors<br /><br />\nStaff Writers: Robert Angervine, Eric Blumenfeld, P.

Why<br />\nnot establish a distinct \"Women's<br />\nStudies\" curriculum, if not a major (as most other prestigious<br />\nuniversities already have done)?<br />\nBoth the lectures and conciliatory<br />\n\"Women's Issue\" section are<br />\ntransitory, half-way solutions for<br />\nendemic problems.<br />\nConsider for a moment: the<br />\nlectures sponsored by Hopkins<br />\nwere precipitated by an obscene<br />\nnewsletter which inadvertently<br />\nended up in the mailbox of a<br />\nFeminist Alliance member. If all<br />\nhad gone to plan, the letter would<br />\nhave been in the hands of a<br />\nchuckling frat member, and the<br />\nwomen on campus, the deans, noone would have been any wiser.<br />\nOne can't help but wonder if<br />\nthere were similar jokes or<br />\nnewsletters being circulated<br />\nprevious to the TEP newsletter,<br />\nor if there have been since.

I feel quite<br />\nqualified to speak on this subject,<br />\nbecause I feel that I've had more<br />\nthan my share of roommate<br />\ntroubles. Though I may not instigate them, they do seem to<br />\nfollow me wherever I go.<br />\nSo how can you piss off your<br />\nroommate? Well, a good idea is<br />\nto visit everyone you know, and<br />\nborrow every battery powered<br />\nalarm clock you can find. At least<br />\neight are necessary. When your<br />\nroommate is away, set the alarms<br />\nat twenty minute intervals starting<br />\nat 2:30 a.m. and stash them<br />\neverywhere: in the ceiling tiles,<br />\nunder his bed, behind some<br />\nclothes. Then go home for the<br />\nweekend. Oh boy, what a look<br />\nyou'll get on Sunday when you<br />\nreturn.

Two points of<br />\nconsideration are obvious upon<br />\nexamination of the apparent<br />\n\"scandal\" in admissions ratios<br />\nrevealed by the first letter of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nFirst, suppose for example (a<br />\npurely hypothetical one) we have<br />\na school with 100 places. Assuming typical Hopkins applicant-toacceptance ratios, we have 200<br />\napplicants for the class. If 15% of<br />\nthe applicants are black, 7%<br />\nAsian, 5% Hispanic, and 5%<br />\nJewish, we would have 2 applicants per percentage point.

The percentage of<br />\nblacks nationwide, and thus in the<br />\napplicant pool, is not the same as<br />\nthe percentage of that ethnic<br />\nderivation in Baltimore.<br />\nOne<br />\npoint is<br />\nreadily<br />\nconceded\u2014 that women make up<br />\n40% of the applicant pool and only 33% of the students. The simple fact may be that 55% of the<br />\nmale applicants and only 41% of<br />\nthe female applicants are<br />\nqua;ified\u2014 this would lead to the<br />\ndiscrepancy between applications<br />\nand admissions percentages.<br />\nMuch as this is lamentable (and<br />\nI'm sure that you can find many<br />\nfreshmen who would gladly trade<br />\ntheir roommates' place in the<br />\nclass for a female of the same major), it is unfortunately a plausible truth. It may be convenient to<br />\ndistrust automatically and<br />\nauthority, but it may not be entirely sane.<br />\nI will patiently await accusations of being a sexist, a racist,<br />\nand a bigot. Anyone who knows<br />\nme knows that is untrue. As for<br />\nthose who prefer to ignore the<br />\nfacts of a world in which the<br />\nrealities of admission break down<br />\nnot into questions of ethnic<br />\nrepresentation but individual<br />\nqualification, you are free to do<br />\nso.

So,<br />\nif the article is due at 5 p.m. on<br />\nTuesday, you spend all of Monday evening asking your roommates if they have any ideas that<br />\nyou can use. They are polite, but<br />\nthey are in fact trying to study,<br />\nand are getting quite annoyed<br />\nwith you. Finally, just to shut you<br />\nup, one roommate says, \"Just do<br />\na damn column on pissing off<br />\nyour roommates while they're<br />\ntrying to study!!\" And there it is.<br />\nThis week's theme.

I'm<br />\ngiving a factual representation of<br />\nevents. My freshman year, I accidentally broke my roommate's<br />\n$20.00 bottle of Pierre Cardin<br />\ncologne. I won't mention his<br />\nname, because I promised I never<br />\nwould again after last year's Best<br />\nStudy Place column, but use your<br />\nimagination. Anyway, he was<br />\nreally annoyed, and still asks me<br />\nat least once a month when I'm<br />\ngoing to pay him for it. After XMas, he came back with a new<br />\nbottle and the caveat that if I<br />\nbroke this one my life would be<br />\nendangered. So one night we on<br />\nthe hall spilled the tiniest bit of his<br />\nnew cologne on the -floor, broke<br />\nan ARA glass on the floor with<br />\nit, and among the shards placed<br />\nthe top of his new bottle. When<br />\nhe came back, his face turned<br />\nlivid red. We told him that, who<br />\nelse, of course, but Jim Clancy<br />\nhad been playing with it and had<br />\ndropped it. He stormed off and<br />\npounded on Clancy's door.<br />\nLuckily Jim wasn't home. Boy<br />\nwas he pissed off when we told<br />\nhim it was just a joke.<br />\nAlthough I was not the cause of<br />\nit, I came into the largest roommate war ever my sophomore<br />\nyear.

Billed as \"An<br />\nAmerican Musical,\" the<br />\nBroadway-bound show opened at<br />\nthe Morris A. Mechanic Theatre<br />\nSeptember 29 to a very enthusiastic audience.<br />\nThe story is loosely based on<br />\nthe lives of President Teddy<br />\nRoosevelt (Len Cariou) and his<br />\nteen-aged daughter, Alice (Nancy Hume). Alice, Teddy's<br />\ndaughter by his first wife and one<br />\ntrue love Alice Lee, is \"coming<br />\nout.\" She challenges social standards by engaging in such lewd<br />\nactivities as smoking in public,<br />\ndriving a car, and wearing a blue<br />\ndress to her coming-out party<br />\nNeedless to say everybody is<br />\ncharmed and appalled by this<br />\nclearly unconservative behavior<br />\nfrom the daughter of such a fine<br />\nupstanding world leader. When<br />\nshe finally lands a man\u2014a balding<br />\n35 year-old congressman (Ron<br />\nRaines)\u2014and looks like she is<br /><br />\nabout to settle down, all of<br />\nAmerica breathes a sigh of relief.<br />\nAll, that is, except for Daddy<br />\nTeddy, who is not so anxious to<br />\nlet the last reminder of his first<br />\nwife marry and leave him. This<br />\npersonal conflict is heightened by<br />\nthe fact that Teddy is up for<br />\nreelection. . .and the media and<br />\nthe GOP (his very own party)<br />\npredict his defeat.<br />\nSet shortly after the turn of the<br />\ncentury, this musical longs for the<br />\ngood ol' days, when men were<br />\nmen, women knew their places<br />\nand musicals portrayed an idyllic<br />\nfantasy world where the biggest<br />\ndanger for the characters is that<br />\nmaybe the lovers will have to<br />\nelope and forgo the family blessings. Teddy and Alice springs<br />\nfrom a different inspiration than<br />\nmany recent Broadway successes.<br />\nSuch hits as Hair, West Side<br />\nStory, A Chorus Line, and La<br />\nCage Aux Folles reflects a cynical<br />\nrealism which has characterized<br />\nMusical Theatre in the past few<br />\ndecades.<br />\nPeople who complain \"They<br />\ndon't make 'em like they used to\"<br />\nwon't have much to say about<br /><br />\nTeddy and Alice. This musical<br />\nstrictly conforms to the old standards. In fact, the creators seem<br />\nto have followed the recipe to a<br />\ntee. Take one heroine, add one<br />\nbig strong man, gradually blend<br />\nin adverse circumstances until no<br />\nlonger visible.<br />\nThose who crave the familiar<br />\nwill enjoy the music as well. John<br />\nPhilip \"three cheers for the red,<br />\nwhite and blue\" Sousa is responsible for the music to which Hal<br />\nHackady has devised lyrics. The<br />\nfamous march \"Stars and Stripes<br />\nForever\" makes its grand appearance at the end of the first act<br />\nfollowing a rousing speech by<br />\nTeddy in front of GOP headquarters. This speech was probably drawn from Theodore<br />\nRoosevelt's real repertoire; no<br />\nwriter in the 1980's would have<br />\ndared compose it. Keepers such<br />\nas \"People say I'm jingoistic,<br />\nwell maybe I am . . . and what's<br />\nwrong with that, jingoism's not a<br />\nbad word\" and \"My country 'tis<br />\nof thee\u2014American is my country\" abound.

What<br />\nthey all had in common was<br />\nmotivation, in addition to a lot of<br />\ngrunts and groans. \"I love the<br />\nsounds you make!\" exclaims<br />\nMarilyn Byers, director of the<br />\ngroup, and a well-known<br />\nchoreographer. Regardless of the<br />\npain, the group seemed happy,<br />\nwith some of the tension eased by<br />\nByers' witty remarks, and supportive pep talks by veteran<br />\ndancers.<br />\nFor experienced as well as<br />\nnovice dancers, the Hopkins<br />\nDance Company meets every<br />\nTuesday, and occasional Sundays, in random places<br />\nthroughout the Homewood campus. The next rehearsal will be<br />\nnext Tuesday at 6:30 in the Glass<br />\nPavilion, and usually runs for<br />\nabout two hours.

Alternating between<br />\ncliches and frightening realism, it<br />\nmanages to grip you where it<br />\nhurts. The story follows Alex<br />\nForrester (Glenn Close), an<br />\neditor in New York and a<br />\nschizophrenic, who has a twonight stand with happily married<br />\nDan<br />\nGallagher (Michael<br />\nDouglas). Alex, who, ironically,<br />\nlives next to the meat market,<br />\nbecomes increasingly obsessed<br />\nwith Dan, who sees the affair as<br />\na momentary weakness. She<br />\nforces herself into his life, following him constantly. Dan is<br />\npowerless is front of his guilt: he<br />\nhas a beautiful wife and darling<br />\ndaughter that he does not want to<br />\nlose. Alex's obsession becomes<br />\nmore and more destructive, and<br />\ntakes violent turns, with a<br />\ngruesome end.<br /><br />\nClose's Alex is a lonely,<br />\npathetic creature on the one side,<br />\nan alarmingly destructive powerful woman on the other. Her<br />\ndown-turned eyes and her angled face seem to ba!ance her alternating roles. Douglas, (looking<br />\nold), is Dan, at first an undefined, vaguely funny character, then<br />\nbecoming strong and weak at the<br />\nsame time. Douglas balances the<br />\nconflicting emotions of shame,<br />\nbetrayal and anger. Anne Archer,<br />\nwho plays Dan's wife, is pure<br />\nsweetness and joy, but manages<br />\nto be genuine.<br />\nYes, but this is a frightening<br />\nmovie. Both Alex and Dan present themselves as victims of one<br />\nanother. We alternately identify<br />\nwith Alex's loneliness, or her<br />\nanger, and then with Dan's<br />\nfrustration and helplessness. We<br />\nfeel drawn to both characters and<br />\nthen to neither. Close magnifies<br />\nqualities that appear in all of us<br />\n(obsession, need for attention,<br />\ndrama) and terrifies us when we<br />\nsee ourselves in her psychotic<br />\nAlex.

A genre that can<br />\nencompass both the Sex Pistols<br />\nand Bon Jovi is wide ranging indeed, and it seems that some<br />\nthings are unfairly lumped off as<br />\nbeing Rock and Roll,'when they<br />\ndon't really deserve that<br />\nclassification. A good example of<br />\nthis would be Tom Waits.<br />\nNobody, including Tom Waits,<br />\nknows just exactly what he isavant-garde artist, chronicler of<br />\nthe seamy side, polyp-voiced<br />\nsinger-all of these things apply,<br />\nbut none of them are quite right.<br />\nThe same might be said of<br />\nWaits' music, which has always<br />\ndefied standards-this is the man,<br />\nwho, on one track of Swordfish<br />\nTrombones, smacked a two-byfour against a dresser to get just<br />\nthe right percussive effect. His<br />\nnew album, Frank's Wild Years,<br />\nis defined as `Un Operachi<br />\nRomantico'-that's what the label<br />\nsays, at least. It might be better<br />\ndescribed as a stage-play with one<br />\nhell of a soundtrack, because this<br />\nis like no opera I'ver ever heard.<br />\nFrank's Wild Years is the story of<br />\na guy who packs up his accordian<br />\nand decides to shake off the dust<br />\nof Rainville, in search of the good<br />\nlife at the top. In a way, I suppose this album is good opera,<br />\nbecause the music carries the<br />\nstory effectively without the stage<br />\nactions. From the maniac<br />\ndesperation of \"Hang on St.<br /><br />\nChristopher\" to the lost innocence of \"Innocent When You<br />\nDream\" each song encapsulates<br />\nthe action-when \"Straight to the<br />\nTop (Vegas)\" degenerates into a<br />\ndissonant mish-mash that turns<br />\ninto the opening of \"I'll Take<br />\nNew York,\" you know that<br />\nFrank's dream has crumbled and<br />\ndeteriorated right along with the<br />\nmusic. This is a hard albumWaits' style is dirty and rough,<br />\neach song sounding like it was<br />\nrecorded in a cheap dive<br />\nsomewhere. I'll bet the CD version even has hiss on it. But this<br />\nis fantastic, bluesy stuff, with guts<br />\nand passion. If you want to hear<br />\nthe kind of stuff that brought them<br />\ninto places like the Cotton Club<br />\nduring the speakeasy era, you<br />\nhave to pick up this album.<br />\nIf Waits is the hard edge of today's rock composers, then<br />\nWilliam Orbit might well represent the other extreme.

Orbit also had his own<br />\ngroup, Torch Song, which he<br />\nformed with his partner, Laurie<br />\nMayer.

Dr. Nickon<br />\nbrought a personal insight to the<br />\nsubject by relating an incident that<br />\noccurred in his lab nine years<br />\nago. He had hired a young,<br />\nposthighly-recommended<br />\ndoctoral student, and while on<br />\nsabbatical, Dr. Nickon left the<br />\nstudent in charge. When Dr.<br />\nNickon returned, the student told<br />\nhim that he would be taking a<br />\nshort vacation for minor surgery<br />\non his hand, and that the research<br />\nsummary of the previous six<br />\nmonths' work would be forthcoming. The short vacation<br />\nturned into a permanent one when<br />\nthe post-doc did not return, leaving behind unpaid bills and an<br />\nabandoned car.

Dr. Nickon emphasized<br />\nthat, although many people would<br />\nlike to believe that fraud does not<br />\nhappen here, Hopkins is not<br />\nimmune.<br />\nThe definition of fraud is important, because there are many<br />\n, subtle ways that fraud is<br />\nperpetrated, said Dr. Ruth Faden,<br />\nProfessor of Health Policy and<br /><br />\nManagement at the School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health.

What to do?<br />\nThe game suddenly turned for<br />\nthe better. Mike Tomczak was<br />\nthrowing incredible passes<br />\neverywhere.

It<br />\nwas altogether an equitable<br />\nsituation.<br /><br />\nThen came 1984.
