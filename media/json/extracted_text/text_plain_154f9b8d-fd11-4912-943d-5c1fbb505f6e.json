The announcement was<br />\nmade in a letter to the Arbitration<br />\nSociety from the Secretary of the<br />\nAssociation. This contest will be<br />\nbetween the winners of the various<br />\nState contests, seven in number.<br />\nMr. Bobbitt, President of the Arbitration Society, who won the Maryland contest, will probably be the<br />\nHopkins representative. It is intended to hold the contest during<br />\none of the sessions of the National<br />\nPeace Congress to be held here May<br />\n3-5. Last year the contest was held<br />\nin Chicago.<br />\nHeretofore the Intercollegiate<br />\nPeace Association, whose headquarters are in Illinois, has held contests<br />\nonly at the Western colleges. But<br />\nthis year it decided to spread Eastward, and Maryland was the first<br />\nState to be included in the contests.<br />\nThe intercollegiate contest should<br />\nprove to be a splendid forensicevent,<br />\nsince the best men from seven States<br />\nwill contest. And we have no doubt<br />\nthat our own Mr. Bobbitt will let<br />\nhimself be heard from at this occasion.<br />\n<br />\nThe two intercollegiate debating<br />\nteams to contest against Washington and Lee and Gettysburg in a<br />\ntriangular debate on April 28 were<br />\nchosen last Wednesday. The affirmative team, which is to stay in<br />\nBaltimore and debate the negative<br />\nteam of Washington and Lee, consists of L. B. Bobbitt,'ii; Leo Wolman,'Ii; J. S. Dickinson,'13, alternate. The negative team will go to<br />\nGettysburg, Pa., to debate the affirmative team of Gettysburg College. It consists of T. B. Price,'12;<br />\nLindsay Rogers, *12, and A. C.<br />\nHatch, '12, alternate. Each man<br />\nwill be given twenty minutes for his<br />\nspeech, and five minutes of this will<br />\nbe devoted to rebuttal. For the first<br />\ntime in many years the Hopkins<br />\nteam has no adviser. This was due<br />\nto the objection of 'Washington and<br />\nLee, which shrank from the ex pense of sending an extra man on<br />\nthe trip. There is not much time<br />\nin which to Prepare the debate, but<br />\nit promises to be a lively contest.<br />\n<br />\nDr. James Brown Scott, lecturer<br />\non international law in this University, Honorary Vice-President of<br />\nthe Arbitration Society and member of the Department of State at<br />\nWashington, has been appointed<br />\nSecretary of the new $10,00p,000<br />\nCarnegie Peace Fund. Dr. Scott<br />\nlast week resigned his position in<br />\nthe Department of State in order to<br />\ndevote his energies to the prosecution of his new duties. He will be<br />\nconnected with the Department of<br />\nState in the future in the capacity<br />\nof legal adviser.

The 2-to-I score shows how<br />\nclose the game was and what a stiff<br />\nproposition the locals had to overcome in order to bring home a victory and to wipe out last year's defeat, which the Annapolitans administered by a single goal.<br />\nThe game on Thursday was in<br />\nmany respects one of the best that<br />\nhas ever been played at the academy. Every point was contested<br />\nfrom start to finish. At times the<br />\ngame was not free from roughness,<br />\nespecially when the play was close<br />\naround goal.<br />\nWhen one considers that the team<br />\nplayed and won its opening contest<br />\nwith two of its best men out of the<br />\ngame, it must be realized that this<br />\nyear's Hopkins team will in no way<br />\nbe a second-rate organization and<br />\nthat the chances are the best for regaining the championship. The<br />\ngreatest credit of Thursday's victory was due to the admirable way<br />\nin which the defense mastered the<br />\nsituation and the excellent individual work of one or two of the attack players. Every man on the defense was at his best, and in all<br />\nstages of the game this part of the<br />\nteam played as a unit. Their body<br />\nchecking was effective, and each<br />\nman showed cleverness in diagnosing the Navy attack plays. \"Butts\"<br />\nSutton, freshman goal tend, was the<br />\nstar of the game.

The announcement was<br />\nmade in a letter to the Arbitration<br />\nSociety from the Secretary of the<br />\nAssociation. This contest will be<br />\nbetween the winners of the various<br />\nState contests, seven in number.<br />\nMr. Bobbitt, President of the Arbitration Society, who won the Maryland contest, will probably be the<br />\nHopkins representative. It is intended to hold the contest during<br />\none of the sessions of the National<br />\nPeace Congress to be held here May<br />\n3-5. Last year the contest was held<br />\nin Chicago.<br />\nHeretofore the Intercollegiate<br />\nPeace Association, whose headquarters are in Illinois, has held contests<br />\nonly at the Western colleges. But<br />\nthis year it decided to spread Eastward, and Maryland was the first<br />\nState to be included in the contests.<br />\nThe intercollegiate contest should<br />\nprove to be a splendid forensicevent,<br />\nsince the best men from seven States<br />\nwill contest. And we have no doubt<br />\nthat our own Mr. Bobbitt will let<br />\nhimself be heard from at this occasion.<br /><br />\nThe two intercollegiate debating<br />\nteams to contest against Washington and Lee and Gettysburg in a<br />\ntriangular debate on April 28 were<br />\nchosen last Wednesday. The affirmative team, which is to stay in<br />\nBaltimore and debate the negative<br />\nteam of Washington and Lee, consists of L. B. Bobbitt,'ii; Leo Wolman,'Ii; J. S. Dickinson,'13, alternate. The negative team will go to<br />\nGettysburg, Pa., to debate the affirmative team of Gettysburg College. It consists of T. B. Price,'12;<br />\nLindsay Rogers, *12, and A. C.<br />\nHatch, '12, alternate. Each man<br />\nwill be given twenty minutes for his<br />\nspeech, and five minutes of this will<br />\nbe devoted to rebuttal. For the first<br />\ntime in many years the Hopkins<br />\nteam has no adviser. This was due<br />\nto the objection of 'Washington and<br />\nLee, which shrank from the ex pense of sending an extra man on<br />\nthe trip. There is not much time<br />\nin which to Prepare the debate, but<br />\nit promises to be a lively contest.<br /><br />\nDr. James Brown Scott, lecturer<br />\non international law in this University, Honorary Vice-President of<br />\nthe Arbitration Society and member of the Department of State at<br />\nWashington, has been appointed<br />\nSecretary of the new $10,00p,000<br />\nCarnegie Peace Fund. Dr. Scott<br />\nlast week resigned his position in<br />\nthe Department of State in order to<br />\ndevote his energies to the prosecution of his new duties. He will be<br />\nconnected with the Department of<br />\nState in the future in the capacity<br />\nof legal adviser. He has resigned<br />\nhis lectureship at the University<br />\nalso.<br /><br />\nHopkins got revenge on the Navy<br />\non Thursday by a score of 2 to I.<br />\nAlthough we did not beat them by a<br />\nbig score, the authorities are gratified at the showing made by the<br />\nteam. The 2-to-I score shows how<br />\nclose the game was and what a stiff<br />\nproposition the locals had to overcome in order to bring home a victory and to wipe out last year's defeat, which the Annapolitans administered by a single goal.<br />\nThe game on Thursday was in<br />\nmany respects one of the best that<br />\nhas ever been played at the academy. Every point was contested<br />\nfrom start to finish. At times the<br />\ngame was not free from roughness,<br />\nespecially when the play was close<br />\naround goal.<br />\nWhen one considers that the team<br />\nplayed and won its opening contest<br />\nwith two of its best men out of the<br />\ngame, it must be realized that this<br />\nyear's Hopkins team will in no way<br />\nbe a second-rate organization and<br />\nthat the chances are the best for regaining the championship. The<br />\ngreatest credit of Thursday's victory was due to the admirable way<br />\nin which the defense mastered the<br />\nsituation and the excellent individual work of one or two of the attack players. Every man on the defense was at his best, and in all<br />\nstages of the game this part of the<br />\nteam played as a unit. Their body<br />\nchecking was effective, and each<br />\nman showed cleverness in diagnosing the Navy attack plays. \"Butts\"<br />\nSutton, freshman goal tend, was the<br />\nstar of the game.

The sophomores are particularly anxious to win because of<br />\ntheir defeat at the hands of the<br />\nfreshmen in football last fall.
