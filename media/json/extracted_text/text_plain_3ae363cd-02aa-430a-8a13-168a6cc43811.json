Bob<br />\nstill works on this project\u2014toward a<br />\ncompletion date of April, 1957.<br />\nShortly after this program started,<br />\nBob joined the Applied Logic Group.<br />\n<br />\nPlotting transistor characteristics<br />\n<br />\nHere, he was concerned with research<br />\nin new areas of computer technology<br />\n\u2014for example, cryogenics and highspeed memories. Bob studies systems<br />\nwhich operate on \"real time,\" and<br />\nhis immediate problem is to analyze<br />\nand synthesize closed-loop sample<br />\ndata systems for the control of complex data processing.<br />\nAsked what his most interesting<br />\nassignment was, Bob replied, \"My<br />\n..<br />\n...<br />\n<br />\nto transistorize six servo-amplifiers<br />\n<br />\nfor the MA-2 bombing-navigational<br />\nsystem,\" he recalls, \"and we cornpleted the project in April.\"<br />\nIn IBM Research (as in all IBM)<br />\nBob works in a small group. \"Our<br />\nteam consists of three E.E.'s and a<br />\ntechnician. We start with analysis<br />\nand synthesis work involving math<br />\nand systems logic.

From April of<br />\nthe same year, he had been working<br />\non a new Government project.

This strictly electronic converter, with transistors, combines<br />\nboth digital and analog circuitry. It<br />\nwas a tough problem, and a fascinating one.\"<br />\nWhat does the future hold?<br />\nAt the present time, after two years<br />\nin IBM Research, Bob is more than<br />\nenthusiastic about his future. He<br />\nplans to continue in systems study<br />\nand to develop \"a more sophisticated<br />\napproach.\" Two lines of advancement<br />\nare open to him: to Project Engineer,<br />\n<br />\nDATA PROCESSING \u2022 ELECTRIC TYPEWRITERS \u2022 TIME EQUIPMENT<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nthe administrative side, or to Staff<br />\nEngineer, the technical side of Research. \"Either way, I'm sure I'll get<br />\nahead,\" Bob feel's. \"Electronics research is really on the move at IBM.<br />\nWe have about 600 people at Poughkeepsie now, as against 56 in 1950.<br />\nWe'll need some 1,700 before 1960 to<br />\nhelp staff a new research laboratory<br />\nat Yorktown Heights, Westchester<br />\nCounty, N.

And, if you<br />\n<br />\nPromoted in fourteen months<br />\n<br />\nfeel the need for more education,<br />\nIBM provides every facility for continued study.

Johns Hopkins<br />\nis the only University ever to<br />\nhave sent two speakers to these<br />\nlectures: Dr. Arthur Oncken<br />\nLovejoy, professor emeritus of<br />\nphilosophy, preceded Dr. Boas.)<br />\nNo Ideal Education<br />\nIn a consideration of what<br />\nmight constitute an ideal educational system, Dr. Boas said,<br />\n\"After teaching since 1915, I<br />\nhave realized one fact: men can<br />\nbe pretty well educated under<br />\nany kind of system.\" He said<br />\nthat he favored the old elective<br />\nsystem initiated by President<br />\nElliot of Harvard, wherein a stu-<br />\n<br />\ndent could select his entire curriculum. \"I don't think the student under this system got a<br />\n'well-rounded' education ... No<br />\nideal can ever be recognized. I<br />\nthink we've got to wake up to<br />\nthe fact that the fields of knowledge are now so varied and that<br />\nso much preliminary knowledge<br />\nis required in them, that we<br />\ncan't expect a person to be a<br />\nscholar in all of them.\" The<br />\nonly way to get a true education, he said, would be \"to do a<br />\nlot of random reading, not reading which is directed by someone<br />\nelse ... The best way to get a<br />\nbroad education is to specialize,<br />\nas paradoxical as it may seem.<br />\nWhen you begin to specialize,<br />\nyou begin to see you've got to<br />\nknow a lot of things outside of<br />\nyour field, in order to understand your subject. When you<br />\nrealize this, the drive to learn<br />\ncomes from within you.<br />\n\"For example, when a man<br />\nrealizes that he's got to learn<br />\nGerman in order to understand<br />\nhis subject, then he will learn it.<br />\nBut when someone says a man<br />\nhas to learn German, there is<br />\nalways a resentment and resistance. That's just simple psychology.\"<br />\nSpecialization At JHU<br />\nWhen he was asked if Hopkins<br />\nat present would tend to promote the cultivation of this type<br />\nof early investigation through<br />\nspecialization, Dr. Boas replied,<br />\n\"I don't think so. There is not<br />\nmuch in the way of an elective<br />\nsystem here now. There seems<br />\nto be an increasing tendency<br />\ntoward the establishment of particular requirements. I think<br />\nthis is a great misfortune.\"<br />\nDr. Boas said that he did not<br />\n<br />\nbelieve that the Hopkins undergraduate, on the whole, was capable of taking advantage of a<br />\nsystem wherein a great deal of<br />\npersonally directed study and<br />\nresearch would be a key factor.<br />\n\"This needs to be qualified,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"When I was Chairman of<br />\nthe Group Council, most of the<br />\nbiology majors (I imagine most<br />\nof -those were pre-medical students) seemed to be better than<br />\nthe others. There is an uneven<br />\ndistribution in the undergraduate school. Usur\"y the students<br />\nwho come here for particular<br />\nthings, such as the history of<br />\nthe social. sciences are among<br />\nthe better students.<br />\n\"In the graduate school, circumstances are different. In the<br />\nPhilosophy department, this year<br />\nthe graduate students are the<br />\nbest crop _we've .ever had. This<br />\nis, indeed, the only reason I regret leaving.\"<br />\nAdvising Essential<br />\nHe emphasized that under a<br />\nsystem allowing a free choice of<br />\nstudies, a strong advisor system<br />\nwas essential on the undergraduate level. \"The student entering<br />\nthe University needs some advice. He doesn't know what the<br />\nvarious courses are, and an advisor can-do a great deal in helping him ... Another role of the<br />\nadvisor should be to get to know<br />\nhis students' possibilities, their<br />\naptitudes, and their general interests in life. If the advisor<br />\nwere able, and the student willing, a real understanding (I was<br />\ngoing to say friendship) could<br />\nbe set up between the two. The<br />\nrelationship would then not just<br />\nbe a perfunctory thing. Of<br />\ncourse, there's no sense in trying to bring about that sort of<br />\n<br />\n-GINNIS<br />\n<br />\nGEORGE BOAS<br />\nrelationship by regulations. Remember, I'm very opposed to<br />\nregulations. I'm sort of<br />\nanarchist.\"<br />\nDr. Boas said that he was encouraged by an apparent bettering of the financial status of the<br />\nhumanities departments.<br />\nHe<br />\nsaid, however, that an insufficient number of fellowships was<br />\navailable to offer good students<br />\nwho desired to enter Hopkins.<br />\nHe was pleased by the reacquisition of Dr. Singleton from Harvard, and said that the naming<br />\nof Dr. Edleman as Chairman of<br />\nthe Romance Languages Department was a \"brilliant appoint-<br />\n<br />\nment.\" He also said \"The younger<br />\nmen in that department are top<br />\nnotch. The English Department<br />\nhas also made great strides in<br />\nthe appointment of its younger<br />\nmen.\"<br />\nHe said that two full professors were going to be brought<br />\ninto the philosophy department.<br />\nprobably within a few months.<br />\nHe stated that he could not release their names, since no definite agreements had yet been<br />\narranged, but said that if the<br />\ntwo men are secured, \"They will<br />\nboth be internationally known<br />\nscholars, and both might be said<br />\nto be on a par with Dr. Singleton.\"<br />\n<br />\nProfessor Jantz Relates Tale<br />\nOfJohn Winthrop Library Qtiest<br />\n\"I was first attracted into this ican representative of both pan- the scope and difficulty of my<br />\nmaze by my interest in the many sophia and German studies was search and took me on 'to sevGerman books in the collection Winthrop.<br />\neral further libraries into which<br />\nand by Winthrop's great imhow he started Winthrop books had disappeared<br />\ntold<br />\nJantz<br />\nDr.<br />\nportance for early American- his search: \"For comparative<br />\nlong ago,\" continued Dr. Jantz.<br />\nGerman relations,\" said Profespurposes I went on to study He had found that books in<br />\nsor Harold Jantz of his work in the other Winthrop books at tne<br />\nseparate libraries which were<br />\ntripling the known number of<br />\nYork Society Library and known to be Winthrop volumes<br />\nNew<br />\nJohn<br />\nvolumes from the library of<br />\nsoon became involved in the had a peculiar kind of number<br />\nWinthrop the Younger, founder<br />\nenigma, the clues to which were that resembled an accession<br />\nConnecticut.<br />\nof<br />\ngovernor<br />\nand<br />\na very few signatures and notes number.

(Since the spring sports have not yet reached<br />\na conclusion, they necessarily will be withheld from this<br />\nreview).<br />\nFootball, soccer, fencing and basketball can be placed<br />\non the credit side of the ledger. Undoubtedly the grid<br />\nsquad has made the largest contribution to Hopkins<br />\nathletics so far this season. Not only did the Jays capture<br />\ntheir first Mason-Dixon football title since 1948, and their<br />\nthird consecutive victory over Western Maryland, but also<br />\ndisplayed ability in the classroom by compiling a 5.176<br />\nscholastic average.

The fact that they were eliminated by<br />\nMt. St. Mary's in the initial round does not detract in<br />\nthe least from the noteworthy accomplishment.<br />\nSo much for the credit side of the ledger. We must<br />\nnow turn reluctantly to face some obvious debits. Essentially the four failings were wrestling, L'Affaire de tennis,<br />\nHomewood visiting team accommodations, and a common<br />\nlack of spectator interest in the so-called minor sports.<br />\nWe hated to see the wrestling program dropped for<br />\na number of reasons. One was the fact that the freshmen<br />\nwere displaying promise of a better future. In truth they<br />\nhave been punished for a situation which arose through<br />\nno fault on their part. A second reason was that the<br />\ncurtailment set a precedent that could be followed in<br />\nthe future with some currently popular sport.<br />\nL'Affaire de tennis rings with emotion.

During<br />\nMcCoy College hours when many<br />\nof the day faculty and employee<br />\nparking spaces are not needed'<br />\nand can be distributed among<br />\nthe students, 652 spaces are<br />\navailable to the student registration and 163 to faculty drivers.,<br />\nMcCoy Troubles Greatest<br />\nConsequently, McCoy College<br />\nstudents and faculty members<br />\nhave the bigger campus parking<br />\nproblem. Nevertheless, checks of<br />\nthe parking lots during the day<br />\nand complaints by students and<br />\nfaculty members indicate that<br />\nthe lots are filled to capacity<br />\nduring most of the day and cannot accommodate all automobiles coming on campus during<br />\ncertain hours, particularly early<br />\nin the morning.<br />\nTo make matters worse, campus automobile registration is increasing at an average rate of<br />\n10% a year. Last year, for instance, only 7,218 cars were registered at the university.<br />\nStudies conducted by an engineering firm and by the university administration indicate<br /><br />\nthat no other large area can be<br />\nused as a parking lot without<br />\ndetracting \"greatly\" from the<br />\n\"integrity\" of the campus. Formerly, the area west of the botanical gardens was considered and<br />\nturned down because roadways<br />\nleading to the lot from the rest<br />\nof the campus would be congested<br />\nand entrances from Wyman Park<br />\nDrive would encourage illegal<br />\nparking by non-university members.<br />\nCar Pools<br />\nIn an effort to forestall measures as drastic as the installation<br />\nof parking meters, Geiger recently polled faculty members and<br />\nemployees concerning their attitude toward the establishment<br />\nof a car pool.

Bob<br />\nstill works on this project\u2014toward a<br />\ncompletion date of April, 1957.<br />\nShortly after this program started,<br />\nBob joined the Applied Logic Group.<br /><br />\nPlotting transistor characteristics<br /><br />\nHere, he was concerned with research<br />\nin new areas of computer technology<br />\n\u2014for example, cryogenics and highspeed memories. Bob studies systems<br />\nwhich operate on \"real time,\" and<br />\nhis immediate problem is to analyze<br />\nand synthesize closed-loop sample<br />\ndata systems for the control of complex data processing.<br />\nAsked what his most interesting<br />\nassignment was, Bob replied, \"My<br />\n..<br />\n...<br /><br />\nto transistorize six servo-amplifiers<br /><br />\nfor the MA-2 bombing-navigational<br />\nsystem,\" he recalls, \"and we cornpleted the project in April.\"<br />\nIn IBM Research (as in all IBM)<br />\nBob works in a small group. \"Our<br />\nteam consists of three E.E.'s and a<br />\ntechnician. We start with analysis<br />\nand synthesis work involving math<br />\nand systems logic. Then we use the<br />\n'black box' approach.\" His group<br />\nsplits up occasionally to research<br />\nspecial phases of a project but reunites in frequent sessions to coordinate activities.<br />\nPromoted to Associate Engineer<br />\nIn August, 1956, Bob was made an<br />\nAssociate Engineer. From April of<br />\nthe same year, he had been working<br />\non a new Government project. This<br />\nwas \"to design and develop a transistorized radar data presentation<br />\nsystem for the MA-2 system.\" Basically, this was a research program in<br />\nsample data theory and the develop-<br /><br />\nNew areas of computer technology<br /><br />\nwork on a digital-to-analog converter<br />\nwith a high degree of sensitivity and<br />\naccuracy. This strictly electronic converter, with transistors, combines<br />\nboth digital and analog circuitry. It<br />\nwas a tough problem, and a fascinating one.\"<br />\nWhat does the future hold?<br />\nAt the present time, after two years<br />\nin IBM Research, Bob is more than<br />\nenthusiastic about his future. He<br />\nplans to continue in systems study<br />\nand to develop \"a more sophisticated<br />\napproach.\" Two lines of advancement<br />\nare open to him: to Project Engineer,<br /><br />\nDATA PROCESSING \u2022 ELECTRIC TYPEWRITERS \u2022 TIME EQUIPMENT<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nthe administrative side, or to Staff<br />\nEngineer, the technical side of Research. \"Either way, I'm sure I'll get<br />\nahead,\" Bob feel's. \"Electronics research is really on the move at IBM.<br />\nWe have about 600 people at Poughkeepsie now, as against 56 in 1950.<br />\nWe'll need some 1,700 before 1960 to<br />\nhelp staff a new research laboratory<br />\nat Yorktown Heights, Westchester<br />\nCounty, N. Y.\"<br />\nWhat does he like best about IBM?<br />\nProbably the fact that he's so much<br />\n\"on his own.\" \"There's no 'over-theshoulder'supervision,\" he says.\"You<br />\nschedule your own program and create your own 'pressure.' And, if you<br /><br />\nPromoted in fourteen months<br /><br />\nfeel the need for more education,<br />\nIBM provides every facility for continued study. Besides the voluntary<br />\ntraining programs, there are excellent<br />\nafterhours courses offered by the IBM<br />\nDepartment of Education.

He has a Guggenheim<br />\nfellowship for next year, and<br />\nplans to use it while studying<br />\nabroad. He will concurrently be<br />\nworking on a book \"dealing with<br />\nwhat Aristotle took for granted.\"<br />\nHe is also finishing up a book<br />\nco-authored with Harold Holmes<br />\nWren, entitled \"What Is a Picture?\" This book, based on Dr.<br />\nBoas' recent article in the Johns<br />\nHopkins Magazine, will contain<br />\napproximately 200 illustvations,<br />\nand, he said, \"will be written in<br />\nthe simplest possible terms.\" 1-n<br />\nthe meanwhile, Dr. Boas is<br />\nawaiting the publication of his<br />\ncontribution to the Carus Lectures, which will be published in<br />\na volume called \"The Inquiring<br />\nMind.\" (The Carus Lectures are<br />\ngiven in Chicago. Johns Hopkins<br />\nis the only University ever to<br />\nhave sent two speakers to these<br />\nlectures: Dr. Arthur Oncken<br />\nLovejoy, professor emeritus of<br />\nphilosophy, preceded Dr. Boas.)<br />\nNo Ideal Education<br />\nIn a consideration of what<br />\nmight constitute an ideal educational system, Dr. Boas said,<br />\n\"After teaching since 1915, I<br />\nhave realized one fact: men can<br />\nbe pretty well educated under<br />\nany kind of system.\" He said<br />\nthat he favored the old elective<br />\nsystem initiated by President<br />\nElliot of Harvard, wherein a stu-<br /><br />\ndent could select his entire curriculum. \"I don't think the student under this system got a<br />\n'well-rounded' education ... No<br />\nideal can ever be recognized. I<br />\nthink we've got to wake up to<br />\nthe fact that the fields of knowledge are now so varied and that<br />\nso much preliminary knowledge<br />\nis required in them, that we<br />\ncan't expect a person to be a<br />\nscholar in all of them.\" The<br />\nonly way to get a true education, he said, would be \"to do a<br />\nlot of random reading, not reading which is directed by someone<br />\nelse ... The best way to get a<br />\nbroad education is to specialize,<br />\nas paradoxical as it may seem.<br />\nWhen you begin to specialize,<br />\nyou begin to see you've got to<br />\nknow a lot of things outside of<br />\nyour field, in order to understand your subject. When you<br />\nrealize this, the drive to learn<br />\ncomes from within you.<br />\n\"For example, when a man<br />\nrealizes that he's got to learn<br />\nGerman in order to understand<br />\nhis subject, then he will learn it.<br />\nBut when someone says a man<br />\nhas to learn German, there is<br />\nalways a resentment and resistance. That's just simple psychology.\"<br />\nSpecialization At JHU<br />\nWhen he was asked if Hopkins<br />\nat present would tend to promote the cultivation of this type<br />\nof early investigation through<br />\nspecialization, Dr. Boas replied,<br />\n\"I don't think so. There is not<br />\nmuch in the way of an elective<br />\nsystem here now. There seems<br />\nto be an increasing tendency<br />\ntoward the establishment of particular requirements. I think<br />\nthis is a great misfortune.\"<br />\nDr. Boas said that he did not<br /><br />\nbelieve that the Hopkins undergraduate, on the whole, was capable of taking advantage of a<br />\nsystem wherein a great deal of<br />\npersonally directed study and<br />\nresearch would be a key factor.<br />\n\"This needs to be qualified,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"When I was Chairman of<br />\nthe Group Council, most of the<br />\nbiology majors (I imagine most<br />\nof -those were pre-medical students) seemed to be better than<br />\nthe others. There is an uneven<br />\ndistribution in the undergraduate school. Usur\"y the students<br />\nwho come here for particular<br />\nthings, such as the history of<br />\nthe social. sciences are among<br />\nthe better students.<br />\n\"In the graduate school, circumstances are different. In the<br />\nPhilosophy department, this year<br />\nthe graduate students are the<br />\nbest crop _we've .ever had. This<br />\nis, indeed, the only reason I regret leaving.\"<br />\nAdvising Essential<br />\nHe emphasized that under a<br />\nsystem allowing a free choice of<br />\nstudies, a strong advisor system<br />\nwas essential on the undergraduate level. \"The student entering<br />\nthe University needs some advice. He doesn't know what the<br />\nvarious courses are, and an advisor can-do a great deal in helping him ... Another role of the<br />\nadvisor should be to get to know<br />\nhis students' possibilities, their<br />\naptitudes, and their general interests in life. If the advisor<br />\nwere able, and the student willing, a real understanding (I was<br />\ngoing to say friendship) could<br />\nbe set up between the two. The<br />\nrelationship would then not just<br />\nbe a perfunctory thing. Of<br />\ncourse, there's no sense in trying to bring about that sort of<br /><br />\n-GINNIS<br /><br />\nGEORGE BOAS<br />\nrelationship by regulations.

(Since the spring sports have not yet reached<br />\na conclusion, they necessarily will be withheld from this<br />\nreview).<br />\nFootball, soccer, fencing and basketball can be placed<br />\non the credit side of the ledger. Undoubtedly the grid<br />\nsquad has made the largest contribution to Hopkins<br />\nathletics so far this season. Not only did the Jays capture<br />\ntheir first Mason-Dixon football title since 1948, and their<br />\nthird consecutive victory over Western Maryland, but also<br />\ndisplayed ability in the classroom by compiling a 5.176<br />\nscholastic average.

One was the fact that the freshmen<br />\nwere displaying promise of a better future. In truth they<br />\nhave been punished for a situation which arose through<br />\nno fault on their part. A second reason was that the<br />\ncurtailment set a precedent that could be followed in<br />\nthe future with some currently popular sport.<br />\nL'Affaire de tennis rings with emotion.
