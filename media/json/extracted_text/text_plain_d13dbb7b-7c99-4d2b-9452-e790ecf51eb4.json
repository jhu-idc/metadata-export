Theater<br />\nweapons are those used at<br />\nshorter distances.\"While thereis a rough parity between the<br />\nUnited States and the Soviet<br />\nUnion in regard to strategic<br />\nweapons, the USSR is superior<br />\nin theater weapons in Europe,\"<br />\n<br />\nsaid David.<br />\nThe Pershing 2 and Cruise<br />\nmissiles, scheduled for deployment at the end of 1983 if no<br />\narms control pact is reached in<br />\nGeneva, are intermediate range<br />\nor theater weapons.<br />\nThe Soviets are opposed to<br />\nthe Pershing 2 and Cruise deployment because they would<br />\nbe American missiles under<br />\nAmerican control in Europe<br />\ncapable of reaching the USSR<br />\nin 5 to 6 minutes.<br />\nPresently, there are no<br />\nNATO missiles in Europe; the<br />\nSoviets have 250 SS-20 missiles<br />\nand 250 other types of missiles<br />\nin Eastern Europe, according to<br />\nDavid. The basic reason for the<br />\ndeployment of American mis-<br />\n<br />\nsiles is to defend Western<br />\nEurope. The U.S. could probably not repel a Soviet invasion<br />\nby conventional means.<br />\nThis situation presents problems, said David. The Soviets<br />\nwould be more inclined to use<br />\ntheir missiles first if it appeared<br />\nthat America would do so to<br />\ndefend Western Europe.<br />\nWithin Western European<br />\nnations, many people are opposed to U.S. missiles on their<br />\nterritory. They want to put<br />\nnuclear weapons out of their<br />\nmind. With good reason, they<br />\ndo not want Europe to be a<br />\nnuclear battleground.<br />\nAnother problem with the<br />\nmissiles is that they are being<br />\nused as bargaining chips, said<br />\n<br />\nDavid. It is a bad precedent to<br />\ndeploy because it is much more<br />\ndifficult to dismantle arms once<br />\nthey are in place than it is to<br />\nsimply not build or deploy<br />\nthem.<br />\nWhat are the options? President Reagan proposed the zero<br />\noption in which the Soviets<br />\nwould destroy all their missiles<br />\nin Europe and the U.S. would<br />\nnot deploy the Pershing 2 and<br />\nCruise missiles. The Soviets rejected this proposal because<br />\nthey stated that the U.S. was<br />\nmaking no concession in exchange for the reduction.<br />\nIn his recent UN address,<br />\nPresident Reagan put forth that<br />\nthe U.S. would match SS-20's<br />\nwith the number of missiles of<br />\n<br />\nBritain and France. The United<br />\nStates rejected this because the<br />\nSoviets would still have a six-toone advantage in warheads. In<br />\naddition, the nuclear weapons<br />\nof Britain and France are independent forces to be used for<br />\nthose countries' last resort selfdefense, not in European war.<br />\nDavid pointed out that<br />\nAmerican credibility is at stake<br />\nif deployment does not occur<br />\nand if there is no arms control<br />\nagreement. David feels that the<br />\nbest course is to deploy some<br />\nmissiles and give arms control<br />\nmore time.

On October first, the full-time squad<br />\nwas created.<br />\nBefore that date, the squad<br />\nhad operated on a part-time<br />\nbasis only, providing onlocation coverage at special<br />\nevents like last April's Spring<br />\nFair, this September's MovingIn Day, and Interfraternity<br />\nCouncil Games. Limitations in<br />\nmanpower, and organizaional<br />\nconstraints, delayed the start of<br />\nthe Squad's full-time operation<br />\nuntil this month, Salzer said.<br />\nThe First-Aid Squad is actually a part of a much larger<br />\norganization of 150 members\u2014<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins First-Aid<br />\nAssociation. All that is required<br />\nfor membership in the Association, Salzer said, is interest and<br />\nminimal involvement.<br />\nThe Association, advised by<br />\nGhislaine Godenne, M.D.,<br />\ndirector of Counseling and<br />\nPsychiatric Services, sponsors<br />\nand provides first-aid education, field trips, and Red Cross<br />\nTraining in Advanced First-Aid<br />\nand in Cardiopulmonary<br />\nResuscitation (CPR).<br />\nCourses in Advanced FirstAid are given each semester and<br />\nover Intersession, and cost<br />\n$14.50; courses in CPR are<br />\ngiven as continously as possible, and cost $10.<br />\nThe fees are set by the Red<br />\nCross, which sponsors the<br />\ntraining.<br />\nMembers of the First-Aid<br />\nSquad, Salzer said, must be certified by the Red Cross in both<br />\nAdvanced First-Aid and in<br />\nCPR. or be licensed Maryland<br />\nEmergency Medical Technologists. These two courses of<br />\ntraining differ slightly, according to Salzer, but both demand over 70 hours of the participant's time.<br />\nA person certified in either<br />\nmanner will be equipped to deal<br />\nwith everything from abrasions,<br />\nbroken bones, and severe<br />\n<br />\nSAT Scores<br />\nConfusing<br />\nCampus Digest New Service<br />\n<br />\nWell it's hard to say what the<br />\nnew SAT nationwide scores<br />\nrepresent. Math-scores improved for the second year in a row,<br />\nbut the verbal scores were<br />\ndown.

The program will provide<br />\n250 one-year scholarships for<br />\nthe 1984-85 school year, 350 in<br />\nthe following year, and 500 in<br />\nits last year. The scholarships<br />\nare being funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.<br />\n<br />\nbleeding to drug overdoses,<br />\nfailed respiration and heartbeat, and emergency childbirth.<br />\nMembers of the squad carry<br />\ntrauma field packs, designed<br />\noriginally for helicopter medics,<br />\nwhenever on duty, and during<br />\nthe course of a service call<br />\nmaintain constant radio and<br />\ntelephone contact with a physician or a nurse-practitioner,<br />\none of whom is on call at all<br />\ntimes.<br />\nThe Squad is accessible<br />\nthrough the main campus<br />\nsecurity extension, 338-7777,<br />\nand will respond to any oncampus emergency \"within<br />\nabout three minutes,\" Salzer<br />\nsaid.<br />\nSquad members, whose advisor is Alain Joffe, M.D.,<br />\ndirector of Medical Services for<br />\nHomewood campus, maintain<br />\ntheir first-aid skills through frequent drills, which supplement<br />\ntheir practical experience.<br />\nThus far, said Salzer, they<br />\nhave been called to emergencies<br />\n<br />\nranging from serious cuts to<br />\nfainting spells. But one need<br />\nnot to be critically injured or ill,<br />\nSalzer stressed, in order to call<br />\nthe Squad; it is ready and willing, he said, to help anyone, for<br />\nwhatever reason.<br />\nAll Squad members are<br />\nstrictly volunteers, and the service they provide is free of<br />\ncharge and wholly confidential.<br />\nThe JHU First-Aid Association, and its sub-group, the<br />\nFirst-Aid<br />\nSquad,<br />\nare<br />\nUniversity-sponsored nonprofit organizations, set up by<br />\na grant from Dean Lucien<br />\nBrush's office and maintained<br />\nby stipends from Dean Chris<br />\nColombo's office.<br />\nSince, as Salzer said, this<br />\nbudget is \"the third-smallest in<br />\nthe school,\" the Squad and the<br />\nAssociation depend upon fundraising _events for a substantial<br />\nportion of the money they need<br />\nto maintain operations.<br />\nAccording to Salzer, fundraising is one of the group's<br />\n<br />\nmain priorities right now. But<br />\nthe first priority, he said, is to<br />\ntrain more people in advanced<br />\nfirst-aid and in CPR.<br />\nSalzer would like to see ten<br />\npercent of the Hopkins community trained in CPR; another<br />\npossible goal, suggested by Andrea Perry, director of Residential Life, is a first-aid course for<br />\nall housemasters.<br />\nThe person to call for information on membership in the<br />\nassociation and on the courses<br />\nit provides is Linda Liang, at<br />\n235-7372; the person to call for<br />\ngeneral information on the<br />\nassociation and the Squad is<br />\nSteve Salzer, at 467-4356.<br />\nSo far, Salzer said, student<br />\nresponse to the courses in Advanced First-Aid and CPR has<br />\nbeen overwhelming. The same<br />\nis true, he added, of the general<br />\nresponse of administration,<br />\nstudents, and faculty to the<br />\nconstant first-aid coverage provided by the Squad.<br />\nThere has been a \"very good<br />\n<br />\nreaction from everyone,\" he<br />\nsaid. People are \"relieved and<br />\ngrateful,\" and \"many are starting to make use of us.\"<br />\nThere are great benefits for<br />\nSquad members as well, Salzer<br />\nstressed. \"First Aid is unique in<br />\nterms of medical experience,\"<br />\nhe said, in that it's the only<br />\nway that a person who hasn't<br />\ngone through an M.D. or nursing program can get hands-on<br />\nexperience in decision-making,<br />\nwhich is a big part of what<br />\nmedical professionals do.\"<br />\nSuch<br />\ndecision-making<br />\nnaturally involves great responsibility, Salzer acknowledged,<br />\nbut, as he added, that, too, is<br />\na large part of the job of a<br />\nmedical professional. And since<br />\nsquad members consult the oncall doctor or nurse about the<br />\ntreatment they administer onthe-spot as well as about future<br />\ntreatment, if that is necessary,<br />\nthey can learn to make decisions and to assume responsibility gradually.<br />\n<br />\nGRAND SLAM<br />\nCAREER MOVE<br />\n<br />\nNSA OFFERS YOU A<br />\nHEAVY\u2014HITTING CAREER OPPORTUNITY<br />\nIN THE FOLLOWING DISCIPLINES:<br />\n<br />\nELECTRONIC<br />\nENGINEERING<br />\n<br />\nCOMPUTER<br />\nSCIENCE<br />\n<br />\nMATHEMATICS<br />\n<br />\nTHE REWARDS<br />\nAT NSA<br />\n<br />\nThere are opportunities in<br />\na variety of research and<br />\ndevelopment projects<br />\nranging from individual<br />\nequipments to very<br />\ncomplex interactive<br />\nsystems involving large<br />\nnumbers of<br />\nmicroprocessors, minicomputers and computer<br />\ngraphics.

The other one was<br />\ndead, with a knife lodged in her back. Blood<br />\nwas splattered all over the room. Clothes<br />\nwere in and out of drawers. Stockings were<br />\nhanging from the lamps. The telephone cord<br />\nwas yanked out of the wall. And above one<br />\nof the dressers was a mirror and on the mirror was a message written in lipstick:<br />\n\"It's a good thing you didn't turn on the<br />\nlight last night because if you had, you<br />\nwouldn't be reading this now.\"<br />\nNo one ever found out how the murderer<br />\ngot into the room.

The street lights could be<br />\nrepaired, with new downwardprojecting lenses.<br />\n3. Two rumble strips or two<br />\nsections of grooved pavement<br />\ncould be put on the bridge<br />\npavement on the southbound<br />\nside, to give an audible warning<br />\nto pedestrians that a vehicle is<br />\napproaching. That audible warning could also be useful to<br />\ndrivers of cars pulling out of the<br />\npassenger drop-off point in<br />\nfront of Olin Hall, the site of<br />\nseveral near-misses recently.<br />\nThe sound should not be a<br />\nbother to people in buildings<br />\nnearby because of screening by<br />\nthe bridge walls.<br />\n<br />\n4. A flashing sign warning of<br />\npedestrian crossing and vehicle<br />\nloading might be placed north<br />\nof the crossing. A driver hardly notices the present crossing<br />\nsign north of the bridge because<br />\nhis concentration is diverted by<br />\nthe sudden appearance of the<br />\nsharp turn and the high walls of<br />\nthe bridge. A flashing sign has<br />\nalready been installed north of<br />\nthe Space Telescope building.<br />\nWe suggest that the university's neighbors be considered if<br />\nthe lighting is improved: the<br />\nlights should be installed so as<br />\nnot to shine across the park to<br />\nannoy our neighbors on Gilman<br />\nTerrace. This is especially important in winter, when leaf fall<br />\nremoves the screen for those<br />\nlights. This can be done by using downward-projecting lenses<br />\nfor street lights, and by aiming<br />\nany flashing traffic signs away<br />\nfrom Gilman Terrace.<br />\nAttitudes toward safety have<br />\nimproved markedly at the<br />\nHomewood campus in the past<br />\nfew years. We urge that the<br />\narea near Merryman and Olin<br />\nHalls receive more attention.<br />\nYours truly<br />\nEugene Meyer<br />\ngrad student, E&PS<br />\nMike Simms<br />\ngrad student, DOGEE<br />\nIrresponsible Electorate<br />\no the Editor:<br />\nLast year Maureen Freed<br />\novercame Doug Fellman in the<br />\nrace for Student Council president.

Nevertheless, I<br />\nchose to have an open mind<br />\nabout Maureen and sincerely<br />\nhoped that she would be able to<br />\nwork well with the council and<br />\nalso be a responsible leader.<br />\nAfter all, it is the student body<br />\nwhich stands to gain or to lose.<br />\nWell, thus far Maureen has<br />\nbeen able to develop neither a<br />\npositive response from the student body nor a healthy relationship with the student newspaper, the students' major<br />\nsource of information.

Zookeepers are monitoring the health of the two giraffes still alive.<br />\n<br />\nThe Baltimore Zoo's Giraffe<br />\nHouse is now home to only two<br />\ngiraffes. Seven giraffes have<br />\ndied in the past two years. Five<br />\nof the zoo's giraffes have died<br />\nin the last two months.<br />\nIn August of this year, Scarface, Termite, and Prudence<br />\ndied of a \"wasting syndrome.\"<br />\nIn September, Colleen, a fiveBaltimore-born<br />\nyear-old<br />\ngiraffe, one of the zoo's most<br />\npopular animals, also died of<br />\nthe mysterious syndrome. In<br />\nlate September, Patience, a<br />\nhealthy giraffe, died of stress<br />\nafter the complicated stillborn<br />\nbirth of a calf, in circumstances<br />\napparently unrelated to the<br />\ndeadly syndrome.<br />\nThe Giraffe House is closed<br />\nto the public while zookeepers<br />\nanxiously monitor the health of<br />\nRaymond and Angel, the only<br />\ngiraffes left. As of writing they<br />\nare said to be fit and are not exhibiting any characteristics of<br />\nthe \"wasting syndrome.\"<br />\nThe syndrome, known as<br />\nganglioneuritis,is a disease that<br />\nattacks the nerve endings in the<br />\nintestines and causes a loss of<br />\nappetite and anemia. Researchers from Johns Hopkins, the<br />\nNational Zoo, the University of<br />\nMaryland, the National Institutes of Health and the<br />\nUniversity of Guelph in Ontario are seeking clues to the<br />\ncause of the disease. Apparently other zoos have lost groups<br />\nof giraffes to the syndrome, but<br />\nnone has lost as many as quickly as the Baltimore Zoo has.<br />\nThe Baltimore Zoo has now<br />\nended plans to specialize in<br />\nbreeding its giraffes, all of<br />\nwhom were Angolans(a deserttype giraffe which is found in<br />\nthe southern portions of Africa)<br />\nof the reticulated species. Until more is discovered about the<br />\ndisease, zoo officials do not<br />\nplan to replace the giraffes or<br />\nto reopen the Giraffe House to<br />\nthe public.<br />\n<br />\nThe National Aquarium in<br />\nBaltimore will be closed to<br />\nvisitors for approximately three<br />\nweeks beginning Tuesday, November 1, for a pre-holiday<br />\nreconditioning of the sevenlevel facility. The closing will<br />\nenable the Aquarium to do a<br />\nthorough \"housecleaning\" and<br />\ngeneral overhaul in preparation<br />\nfor the holiday season and the<br />\nnew year.<br />\nAccording to the aquarium's<br />\nacting director William Flynn,<br />\nSr., the reconditioning will<br />\nenable the Aquarium to deal<br />\nwith the results of its fantastic<br />\nsuccess\u2014heavy and almost constant use of the building by a<br />\ntotal of 3.5 million visitors.<br />\nDuring the reconditioning<br />\nperiod, the Aquarium will refine the decorative, graphic,<br />\nand mechanical aspects of exhibits, upgrade visitor areas,<br />\nand complete the last stage of<br />\nthe members' entrance re-design.<br />\nAmong the scheduled exhibit<br />\nrepairs are two major improvements\u2014repainting of the Ma-<br />\n<br />\nrine Mammal Tray and alterations in the Amazon Rain Forest. The alterations to the rain<br />\nforest exhibit will lay the<br />\ngroundwork for an additional<br />\ndisplay, scheduled for installation in Spring 1984.<br />\nGeneral improvements in the<br />\nvisitor areas, including the<br />\nreplacement of some flooring<br />\nand the repainting of handrails,<br />\nwill keep the facility in peak<br />\ncondition for future visitors. A<br />\nre-designed members' entrance,<br />\nequipped with a glass-enclosed<br />\nvestibule and electrically operated sliding doors, will make it<br />\neasier for handicapped visitors<br />\nand members to enter the building and protect them from inclement weather. \"The reconditioning will help the Aquarium maintain its reputation as<br />\none of the most attractive and<br />\nsophisticated facilities of its<br />\nkind in the world,\" explains<br />\nAquarium Chairman of the<br />\nBoard Neal Borden.\"We want<br />\nto do _everything necessary to<br />\noffer the highest quality recreational and educational experience to the public.\"<br />\n<br />\nEAM Strives To Educate Public About Epilepsy<br />\nby Jay Schneider<br />\nIn the United States, there<br />\nare more than two million epileptics, or nearly one percent of<br />\nthe country's population. Each<br />\nYear 100,000 new cases are reported, mostly among children.<br />\nAbout 40,000 Maryland residents are epileptics. The Epilepsy Association of Maryland<br />\n(EAM)is located at 3121 Saint<br />\nPaul Street. Its purpose is to<br />\naddress the major problems<br />\nthat epileptics have. It is affiliated with the Epilepsy Foundation of America, which has<br />\na national office located in<br />\nWashington, D.C. EAM provides a variety of services for its<br />\nclients.<br />\nThe Training and Placement<br />\nService assists epileptics in finding and keeping long-term emPloyment. Epilepsy, as a handi-<br />\n<br />\ncap, has the highest unemployment; many employers are reluctant to hire epileptics. A<br />\nrelated problem to that of finding employment is the difficulty of obtaining insurance. Recently, it has become easier for<br />\nepileptics to obtain coverage,<br />\nbut they are subject to exclusions for any claims related to<br />\nepilepsy.<br />\nEAM runs a program in the<br />\nBaltimore City School System<br />\nwhose purpose is to identify<br />\nthose students, fourteen or<br />\nolder, who have epilepsy. Once<br />\nthey are identified, the students<br />\ncan obtain proper medical and<br />\nsocial care.<br />\nA variety of counseling services are provided by EAM.<br />\nThere is a self-help group that<br />\nmeets monthly. It is similar in<br />\nits set-up to Alcoholics Anonymous; both rely upon the ideas<br />\n<br />\nof peer counseling and the<br />\ntraining of people to be peer<br />\nleaders.<br />\nIndividual counseling of epileptics is also available. Often,<br />\nclients come through referrals<br />\nfrom doctors. Some clients who<br />\nhave already gone_ to government social service agencies<br />\nfind that EAM is their last<br />\nresort, after the government<br />\nagency referred them to EAM.<br />\nOnce the client arrives, he sees<br />\na counselor, and the epileptic's<br />\nsocial, psychological, and medical needs are assessed. No<br />\nmedical diagnoses are made on<br />\nthe premises; instead the client<br />\nis referred to a doctor or a<br />\nneurologist.<br />\nEAM provides professional<br />\ntraining for teachers, nurses,<br />\nsocial workers, and emergency<br />\nmedical teams. The staff also<br />\nhelps epileptics locate social,<br />\n<br />\nmedical, and educational assistance or assistance in other<br />\nareas that may not be available<br />\nat the Baltimore City location.<br />\nOne of the major ongoing<br />\npurposes of EAM is to educate<br />\nthe general public about epilepsy and to dispel the various<br />\nmyths surrounding it. Epilpesy<br />\nwas once thought to be caused<br />\nby demonic possession. Many<br />\npeople connected epilepsy with<br />\ninsanity. Only three years ago,<br />\nat a county fair in Hagerstown<br />\nwhere EAM had a booth, people congregated in front of the<br />\nbooth, praying for the demons<br />\nto leave the bodies of the<br />\nepileptics.<br />\nIn reality, epilepsy is a<br />\nmanifestation of excessive and<br />\nsynchronous electrical discharges of a large number of cerebral neurons. Epilepsy itself is<br />\nnot a disease; rather, it is the<br />\n<br />\nmanifestation of one or more il\u2014<br />\nlnesses. Epilepsy can be caused<br />\nby head trauma at birth, meningitis, brain tumors, brain injuries, brain abscesses, and<br />\nrelated I occur,rences.The outward signs of epilepsy may not<br />\nbecome obvious until years<br />\nafter the injury was sustained,<br />\nor after the illness has run its<br />\ncourse. Any number of things<br />\ncould trigger a seizure, such as<br />\nfatigue, extreme cold, consumption of alcohol, or lack of<br />\nmedication. Medication can<br />\ntotally control the seizures of<br />\napproximately fifty percent of<br />\nepileptics. Another thirty percent have their seizures partially controlled, while the Epilepsy Foundation of America estimates twenty percent of all<br />\nepileptics are not taking medication, and their seizures are<br />\nnot controlled.<br />\n<br />\n\f10/OCTOBER 14, 1983<br />\n<br />\nArts<br />\n<br />\nby Er<br />\n<br />\nThe Bus Stops Here<br />\nby Maria Howell and<br />\nJ.E. Green<br />\nWilliam Inge's play Bus<br />\nStop, currently playing at the<br />\nSpotlighters Theatre, is well<br />\nworth seeing. This is an excellent community theater production of a bitter-sweet<br />\ncomedy.<br />\nThe action of the play takes<br />\nplace in a small cafe just outisde<br />\nof Kansas City, presumably in<br />\nthe late 1950's (the costuming<br />\nis very inconsistent in regard to<br />\nthe period). The cafe is, in effect, a bus stop where the bus<br />\nfrom Kansas City to Topeka<br />\nstops for 20 minutes to pick up'<br />\npassengers.<br />\nThe play begins about 1:00<br />\na.m. on a night in early March.<br />\nUnseasonably bad weather closes the main road and forces the<br />\nbus to stay at the cafe longer<br />\nthan the scheduled 20 minutes.<br />\nA motley collection of passengers gets off the bus and congregates in the cafe for the<br />\n<br />\nduration. The rest of the play<br />\ndeals with the relationships and<br />\ninteractions among the various<br />\ncharacters, all of whom are<br />\nlonely either because of their<br />\nlocation or situation.<br />\nFine performances were<br />\nturned in by each of the players. In particular, Tom Blair as<br />\nthe guardian cowboy and Dena<br />\nLuebke as the backwoods singer were compelling from start<br />\nto finish. Miss Luebke's off-key<br />\nrendition of All of Me added<br />\nthat much more to her touching<br />\nportrayal of a lonely 19-yearold country girl trying to cut it<br />\nin the \"big city\". Blair's<br />\ncharacter, although one of few<br />\nlines, was a striking presence on<br />\nstage, thanks to his quiet skill.<br />\nHe is a controlled actor who<br />\ncertainly knows his craft.<br />\nAlso deserving mention are<br />\nAmy Hoffman as the young<br />\nwaitress and Audrey Herman as<br />\nthe husky voiced cafe-owner(a<br />\nrole she played 20 years ago<br />\nwhen the Spotlighters opened<br />\n<br />\nwith this same show). Early in<br />\nthe play, Kevin Sharun, as the<br />\nrambunctious cowboy, was<br />\nstereotypical in his portrayal of<br />\nthe adolescent experiencing<br />\ngrowing pains. This, however,<br />\npassed quickly and he presented<br />\n<br />\nthe audience with a wonderful<br />\ncharacterization of a slightly<br />\ngawky but sincere youth.<br />\nBill Gavin, as the Sheriff,<br />\nwas very good in his portrayal<br />\nof fatherly concern. His position as a figure of authority was<br />\nnot apparent in his behavior<br />\nuntil the end of the second act.<br />\nLarry Ilase played the jaded<br />\nprofessor deftly, but was sometimes difficult to understand.<br />\n<br />\nAll of these are however,<br />\nminor complaints when brought<br />\ninto the perspective of the entire production, Bus Stop,<br />\nwhich combines good direction, set, and acting into a fine<br />\nevening at the theater.<br />\nForfurther information, see the<br />\nArts Calendar.<br />\n<br />\nJoseph and the Amazing<br />\nTechnicolor Dream Coat: The<br />\nBroadway musical hit written<br />\nby Andrew Loyd Webster and<br />\nTim Rice (of Jesus Christ<br />\nSuperstar and Evita fame),<br />\n\"Joseph is the joyous musical<br />\nversion of the Old Testament<br />\nJoseph story.

Just another<br />\nMTV band, I thought\u2014shmaltzy designer costumes, toughguy makeup\u2014all style and no<br />\nsubstance. But as soon as I<br />\nheard the first few minutes of<br />\nthe album, I realized that Wide<br />\nBoy Awake is a \"Nu-Musik\"<br />\nband with a difference. Unlike<br />\nCulture Club, Duran Duran,<br />\nand the rest of the Glitz-Blitz<br />\ncrowd, this highly fashionable<br />\nfoursome has muscial talent as<br />\nwell as good looks.<br />\nWide Boy Awake was founded by former Ant Kevin Mooney. Adam's influence, both<br />\nmusical and visual, is readily<br />\napparent. The rhythms and<br />\nmusic, drawing from a wide<br />\nrange of sources including<br />\nCaribbean, African, Cajun,<br />\nand even Country music, are<br />\noften reminiscent of the better<br />\nmusic from the Ant's early albums. Yet there is also a freshness and originality to Wide<br />\nBoy Awake's music that is generally lacking among the better<br />\nknown Adam Ant clone bands.<br />\nThis self-titled debut record,<br />\na five song e.p., begins with the<br />\nWide Boy Awake MTV and<br />\nclub hit, Chicken Outlaw.<br />\nOpening with a pounding syn-<br />\n<br />\nthesiser and drum beat, this irresistably danceable song<br />\nbreaks out into a techno-Creole<br />\nfoot-stomper. Another Cajunesque romp, Bona Venture, is<br />\nwithout a doubt the best dance<br />\nsong of the year. Sounding a<br />\nlittle like the Clash's Let's Go<br />\nCrazy with added fiddle, this<br />\ntune is enough to make even the<br />\nmost hardcore D-leveler jump<br />\nup from his seat and make like<br />\nFred Astaire.<br />\nWhile none of the other<br />\nsongs on this record are quite so<br />\nrousing, they are at least much<br />\nbetter examples of synth-funk<br />\nthan most other \"nu-musik\"<br />\nbands are providing. Slang<br />\nTeacher, for example, another<br />\nclub hit, packs just enough<br />\npunch to keep it from droning.<br />\nHopefully, future releases from<br />\nW.B.A. will lean more heavily<br />\non the Caribbean and Cajun influences and shy away from the<br />\nmore bland techno-pop shlock.<br />\nWhat about the lyrics? Who<br />\nknows? And who cares? This<br />\nmusic is for dancing, not thinking. For all I know, the words<br />\nmay be just as clever as the<br />\nmusic. But I was having too<br />\nmuch fun enjoying dancing to<br />\nthis record to sit down and concentrate on what it was saying.<br />\nIn short, Wide Boy Awake<br />\nmay just be the best dance band<br />\nto come out of the Video Revolution. Their debut album certainly is the most fun.<br />\n<br />\ncont. from p. 10<br />\nAuditorium at the Walters Art<br />\nGallery. Tickets are $4.00 with<br />\nstudent I.D.

Theater<br />\nweapons are those used at<br />\nshorter distances.\"While thereis a rough parity between the<br />\nUnited States and the Soviet<br />\nUnion in regard to strategic<br />\nweapons, the USSR is superior<br />\nin theater weapons in Europe,\"<br /><br />\nsaid David.<br />\nThe Pershing 2 and Cruise<br />\nmissiles, scheduled for deployment at the end of 1983 if no<br />\narms control pact is reached in<br />\nGeneva, are intermediate range<br />\nor theater weapons.<br />\nThe Soviets are opposed to<br />\nthe Pershing 2 and Cruise deployment because they would<br />\nbe American missiles under<br />\nAmerican control in Europe<br />\ncapable of reaching the USSR<br />\nin 5 to 6 minutes.<br />\nPresently, there are no<br />\nNATO missiles in Europe; the<br />\nSoviets have 250 SS-20 missiles<br />\nand 250 other types of missiles<br />\nin Eastern Europe, according to<br />\nDavid. The basic reason for the<br />\ndeployment of American mis-<br /><br />\nsiles is to defend Western<br />\nEurope. The U.S. could probably not repel a Soviet invasion<br />\nby conventional means.<br />\nThis situation presents problems, said David. The Soviets<br />\nwould be more inclined to use<br />\ntheir missiles first if it appeared<br />\nthat America would do so to<br />\ndefend Western Europe.<br />\nWithin Western European<br />\nnations, many people are opposed to U.S. missiles on their<br />\nterritory. They want to put<br />\nnuclear weapons out of their<br />\nmind. With good reason, they<br />\ndo not want Europe to be a<br />\nnuclear battleground.<br />\nAnother problem with the<br />\nmissiles is that they are being<br />\nused as bargaining chips, said<br /><br />\nDavid. It is a bad precedent to<br />\ndeploy because it is much more<br />\ndifficult to dismantle arms once<br />\nthey are in place than it is to<br />\nsimply not build or deploy<br />\nthem.<br />\nWhat are the options? President Reagan proposed the zero<br />\noption in which the Soviets<br />\nwould destroy all their missiles<br />\nin Europe and the U.S. would<br />\nnot deploy the Pershing 2 and<br />\nCruise missiles. The Soviets rejected this proposal because<br />\nthey stated that the U.S. was<br />\nmaking no concession in exchange for the reduction.<br />\nIn his recent UN address,<br />\nPresident Reagan put forth that<br />\nthe U.S. would match SS-20's<br />\nwith the number of missiles of<br /><br />\nBritain and France. The United<br />\nStates rejected this because the<br />\nSoviets would still have a six-toone advantage in warheads. In<br />\naddition, the nuclear weapons<br />\nof Britain and France are independent forces to be used for<br />\nthose countries' last resort selfdefense, not in European war.<br />\nDavid pointed out that<br />\nAmerican credibility is at stake<br />\nif deployment does not occur<br />\nand if there is no arms control<br />\nagreement. David feels that the<br />\nbest course is to deploy some<br />\nmissiles and give arms control<br />\nmore time.

On October first, the full-time squad<br />\nwas created.<br />\nBefore that date, the squad<br />\nhad operated on a part-time<br />\nbasis only, providing onlocation coverage at special<br />\nevents like last April's Spring<br />\nFair, this September's MovingIn Day, and Interfraternity<br />\nCouncil Games. Limitations in<br />\nmanpower, and organizaional<br />\nconstraints, delayed the start of<br />\nthe Squad's full-time operation<br />\nuntil this month, Salzer said.<br />\nThe First-Aid Squad is actually a part of a much larger<br />\norganization of 150 members\u2014<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins First-Aid<br />\nAssociation. All that is required<br />\nfor membership in the Association, Salzer said, is interest and<br />\nminimal involvement.<br />\nThe Association, advised by<br />\nGhislaine Godenne, M.D.,<br />\ndirector of Counseling and<br />\nPsychiatric Services, sponsors<br />\nand provides first-aid education, field trips, and Red Cross<br />\nTraining in Advanced First-Aid<br />\nand in Cardiopulmonary<br />\nResuscitation (CPR).<br />\nCourses in Advanced FirstAid are given each semester and<br />\nover Intersession, and cost<br />\n$14.50; courses in CPR are<br />\ngiven as continously as possible, and cost $10.<br />\nThe fees are set by the Red<br />\nCross, which sponsors the<br />\ntraining.<br />\nMembers of the First-Aid<br />\nSquad, Salzer said, must be certified by the Red Cross in both<br />\nAdvanced First-Aid and in<br />\nCPR. or be licensed Maryland<br />\nEmergency Medical Technologists. These two courses of<br />\ntraining differ slightly, according to Salzer, but both demand over 70 hours of the participant's time.<br />\nA person certified in either<br />\nmanner will be equipped to deal<br />\nwith everything from abrasions,<br />\nbroken bones, and severe<br /><br />\nSAT Scores<br />\nConfusing<br />\nCampus Digest New Service<br /><br />\nWell it's hard to say what the<br />\nnew SAT nationwide scores<br />\nrepresent.

The program will provide<br />\n250 one-year scholarships for<br />\nthe 1984-85 school year, 350 in<br />\nthe following year, and 500 in<br />\nits last year. The scholarships<br />\nare being funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.<br /><br />\nbleeding to drug overdoses,<br />\nfailed respiration and heartbeat, and emergency childbirth.<br />\nMembers of the squad carry<br />\ntrauma field packs, designed<br />\noriginally for helicopter medics,<br />\nwhenever on duty, and during<br />\nthe course of a service call<br />\nmaintain constant radio and<br />\ntelephone contact with a physician or a nurse-practitioner,<br />\none of whom is on call at all<br />\ntimes.<br />\nThe Squad is accessible<br />\nthrough the main campus<br />\nsecurity extension, 338-7777,<br />\nand will respond to any oncampus emergency \"within<br />\nabout three minutes,\" Salzer<br />\nsaid.<br />\nSquad members, whose advisor is Alain Joffe, M.D.,<br />\ndirector of Medical Services for<br />\nHomewood campus, maintain<br />\ntheir first-aid skills through frequent drills, which supplement<br />\ntheir practical experience.<br />\nThus far, said Salzer, they<br />\nhave been called to emergencies<br /><br />\nranging from serious cuts to<br />\nfainting spells. But one need<br />\nnot to be critically injured or ill,<br />\nSalzer stressed, in order to call<br />\nthe Squad; it is ready and willing, he said, to help anyone, for<br />\nwhatever reason.<br />\nAll Squad members are<br />\nstrictly volunteers, and the service they provide is free of<br />\ncharge and wholly confidential.<br />\nThe JHU First-Aid Association, and its sub-group, the<br />\nFirst-Aid<br />\nSquad,<br />\nare<br />\nUniversity-sponsored nonprofit organizations, set up by<br />\na grant from Dean Lucien<br />\nBrush's office and maintained<br />\nby stipends from Dean Chris<br />\nColombo's office.<br />\nSince, as Salzer said, this<br />\nbudget is \"the third-smallest in<br />\nthe school,\" the Squad and the<br />\nAssociation depend upon fundraising _events for a substantial<br />\nportion of the money they need<br />\nto maintain operations.<br />\nAccording to Salzer, fundraising is one of the group's<br /><br />\nmain priorities right now. But<br />\nthe first priority, he said, is to<br />\ntrain more people in advanced<br />\nfirst-aid and in CPR.<br />\nSalzer would like to see ten<br />\npercent of the Hopkins community trained in CPR; another<br />\npossible goal, suggested by Andrea Perry, director of Residential Life, is a first-aid course for<br />\nall housemasters.<br />\nThe person to call for information on membership in the<br />\nassociation and on the courses<br />\nit provides is Linda Liang, at<br />\n235-7372; the person to call for<br />\ngeneral information on the<br />\nassociation and the Squad is<br />\nSteve Salzer, at 467-4356.<br />\nSo far, Salzer said, student<br />\nresponse to the courses in Advanced First-Aid and CPR has<br />\nbeen overwhelming. The same<br />\nis true, he added, of the general<br />\nresponse of administration,<br />\nstudents, and faculty to the<br />\nconstant first-aid coverage provided by the Squad.<br />\nThere has been a \"very good<br /><br />\nreaction from everyone,\" he<br />\nsaid. People are \"relieved and<br />\ngrateful,\" and \"many are starting to make use of us.\"<br />\nThere are great benefits for<br />\nSquad members as well, Salzer<br />\nstressed. \"First Aid is unique in<br />\nterms of medical experience,\"<br />\nhe said, in that it's the only<br />\nway that a person who hasn't<br />\ngone through an M.D. or nursing program can get hands-on<br />\nexperience in decision-making,<br />\nwhich is a big part of what<br />\nmedical professionals do.\"<br />\nSuch<br />\ndecision-making<br />\nnaturally involves great responsibility, Salzer acknowledged,<br />\nbut, as he added, that, too, is<br />\na large part of the job of a<br />\nmedical professional. And since<br />\nsquad members consult the oncall doctor or nurse about the<br />\ntreatment they administer onthe-spot as well as about future<br />\ntreatment, if that is necessary,<br />\nthey can learn to make decisions and to assume responsibility gradually.<br /><br />\nGRAND SLAM<br />\nCAREER MOVE<br /><br />\nNSA OFFERS YOU A<br />\nHEAVY\u2014HITTING CAREER OPPORTUNITY<br />\nIN THE FOLLOWING DISCIPLINES:<br /><br />\nELECTRONIC<br />\nENGINEERING<br /><br />\nCOMPUTER<br />\nSCIENCE<br /><br />\nMATHEMATICS<br /><br />\nTHE REWARDS<br />\nAT NSA<br /><br />\nThere are opportunities in<br />\na variety of research and<br />\ndevelopment projects<br />\nranging from individual<br />\nequipments to very<br />\ncomplex interactive<br />\nsystems involving large<br />\nnumbers of<br />\nmicroprocessors, minicomputers and computer<br />\ngraphics.

And if they do, he walks inside and<br />\nsees if anyone's there. He checks every room,<br />\neven the kitchen in case he's hungry, until<br />\nhe gets to the bedrooms.<br />\nHe slowly walks toward the bed or beds,<br />\ndepending upon which room he decides to<br />\nvisit first, and if anyone happens to be sleeping, he won't be sleeping much longer. He'll<br />\nbe dead or pretty damn close to it. It doesn't<br />\neven matter how he kills him. He could use<br />\na gun or a sledgehammer or a butcher's knife<br />\nor a pillow or perhaps a chainsaw. Whichever way he chooses, people will still die.<br />\nAnd he'll kill as many people as he wants.<br />\nIt's almost like it can't happen, like it's<br />\none of those things that could never happen<br />\nto you, one of those incidents that just seems<br />\nso strange, you can't believe it could ever<br />\nhappen to anyone.<br />\nBut it does happen, and people do get<br />\nkilled.<br />\nIt happened a few years ago at an obscure<br />\ncollege. There were two female roommates,<br />\nand one of them went on a date one night<br />\nwhile the other one stayed home. The one<br />\nwho went on the date came back early be-<br /><br />\ncause she wasn't feeling well.<br />\nThe following morning, only one of the<br />\nroommates woke up. The other one was<br />\ndead, with a knife lodged in her back. Blood<br />\nwas splattered all over the room. Clothes<br />\nwere in and out of drawers. Stockings were<br />\nhanging from the lamps. The telephone cord<br />\nwas yanked out of the wall. And above one<br />\nof the dressers was a mirror and on the mirror was a message written in lipstick:<br />\n\"It's a good thing you didn't turn on the<br />\nlight last night because if you had, you<br />\nwouldn't be reading this now.\"<br />\nNo one ever found out how the murderer<br />\ngot into the room. The door was probably<br />\nleft unlocked. Or perhaps the murderer was<br />\nin the room before his victim went to sleep.<br />\nHe might have also hid under the bed or inside a closet.<br />\nWaiting for someone to leave a door open<br />\nis another way to enter a dormitory or apartment room. The murderer can then hide behind the door. And when the student returns<br />\nfrom talking to some friends living down the<br />\nhall, he won't be living the comfortable life<br />\nof a college co-ed much longer.

We understand<br />\nthat fortunately she escaped<br />\nwith only a few injuries. Traffic near-misses oceur at the<br />\nsame walk where it crosses San<br />\nMartin Drive near plin Hall.<br />\nThere are two i problems:<br />\nlighting is uneven at night, and<br />\nvision is obscured by day and<br />\nnight by the high stone walls of<br />\nthe bridge. We suggest solutions for these problems.<br />\nLighting is dim at the eastern<br />\npart of the walk, and at the<br />\nwestern end near the entrance<br />\nto Olin Hall. At the San Martin Drive crossing, the street<br />\nlights give little light. Their<br />\nlenses seem discolored and<br />\npartly opaque.<br />\nThe traffic problem is that<br />\npeople crossing San Martin in<br />\nthe designated pedestrian walk<br />\ncannot see or hear small cars<br />\ncoming south on the bridge.<br />\nDrivers of small cars cannot see<br />\nthe pedestrians until the last<br />\nmoment. There are three reasons\u2014the road has a sharp<br />\ncurve, the bridge walls are high,<br />\nand the pavement is so smooth<br />\nthat cars can travel quietly.<br />\nWe suggest the following<br />\nsteps be taken:<br />\n1. The lighting could be improved on the walk next to<br />\nMerryman Hall, and at its end<br />\nnear Olin Hall.<br />\n2. The street lights could be<br />\nrepaired, with new downwardprojecting lenses.<br />\n3. Two rumble strips or two<br />\nsections of grooved pavement<br />\ncould be put on the bridge<br />\npavement on the southbound<br />\nside, to give an audible warning<br />\nto pedestrians that a vehicle is<br />\napproaching. That audible warning could also be useful to<br />\ndrivers of cars pulling out of the<br />\npassenger drop-off point in<br />\nfront of Olin Hall, the site of<br />\nseveral near-misses recently.<br />\nThe sound should not be a<br />\nbother to people in buildings<br />\nnearby because of screening by<br />\nthe bridge walls.<br /><br />\n4. A flashing sign warning of<br />\npedestrian crossing and vehicle<br />\nloading might be placed north<br />\nof the crossing. A driver hardly notices the present crossing<br />\nsign north of the bridge because<br />\nhis concentration is diverted by<br />\nthe sudden appearance of the<br />\nsharp turn and the high walls of<br />\nthe bridge. A flashing sign has<br />\nalready been installed north of<br />\nthe Space Telescope building.<br />\nWe suggest that the university's neighbors be considered if<br />\nthe lighting is improved: the<br />\nlights should be installed so as<br />\nnot to shine across the park to<br />\nannoy our neighbors on Gilman<br />\nTerrace. This is especially important in winter, when leaf fall<br />\nremoves the screen for those<br />\nlights. This can be done by using downward-projecting lenses<br />\nfor street lights, and by aiming<br />\nany flashing traffic signs away<br />\nfrom Gilman Terrace.<br />\nAttitudes toward safety have<br />\nimproved markedly at the<br />\nHomewood campus in the past<br />\nfew years. We urge that the<br />\narea near Merryman and Olin<br />\nHalls receive more attention.<br />\nYours truly<br />\nEugene Meyer<br />\ngrad student, E&amp;PS<br />\nMike Simms<br />\ngrad student, DOGEE<br />\nIrresponsible Electorate<br />\no the Editor:<br />\nLast year Maureen Freed<br />\novercame Doug Fellman in the<br />\nrace for Student Council president.

Zookeepers are monitoring the health of the two giraffes still alive.<br /><br />\nThe Baltimore Zoo's Giraffe<br />\nHouse is now home to only two<br />\ngiraffes. Seven giraffes have<br />\ndied in the past two years. Five<br />\nof the zoo's giraffes have died<br />\nin the last two months.<br />\nIn August of this year, Scarface, Termite, and Prudence<br />\ndied of a \"wasting syndrome.\"<br />\nIn September, Colleen, a fiveBaltimore-born<br />\nyear-old<br />\ngiraffe, one of the zoo's most<br />\npopular animals, also died of<br />\nthe mysterious syndrome. In<br />\nlate September, Patience, a<br />\nhealthy giraffe, died of stress<br />\nafter the complicated stillborn<br />\nbirth of a calf, in circumstances<br />\napparently unrelated to the<br />\ndeadly syndrome.<br />\nThe Giraffe House is closed<br />\nto the public while zookeepers<br />\nanxiously monitor the health of<br />\nRaymond and Angel, the only<br />\ngiraffes left. As of writing they<br />\nare said to be fit and are not exhibiting any characteristics of<br />\nthe \"wasting syndrome.\"<br />\nThe syndrome, known as<br />\nganglioneuritis,is a disease that<br />\nattacks the nerve endings in the<br />\nintestines and causes a loss of<br />\nappetite and anemia. Researchers from Johns Hopkins, the<br />\nNational Zoo, the University of<br />\nMaryland, the National Institutes of Health and the<br />\nUniversity of Guelph in Ontario are seeking clues to the<br />\ncause of the disease. Apparently other zoos have lost groups<br />\nof giraffes to the syndrome, but<br />\nnone has lost as many as quickly as the Baltimore Zoo has.<br />\nThe Baltimore Zoo has now<br />\nended plans to specialize in<br />\nbreeding its giraffes, all of<br />\nwhom were Angolans(a deserttype giraffe which is found in<br />\nthe southern portions of Africa)<br />\nof the reticulated species. Until more is discovered about the<br />\ndisease, zoo officials do not<br />\nplan to replace the giraffes or<br />\nto reopen the Giraffe House to<br />\nthe public.<br /><br />\nThe National Aquarium in<br />\nBaltimore will be closed to<br />\nvisitors for approximately three<br />\nweeks beginning Tuesday, November 1, for a pre-holiday<br />\nreconditioning of the sevenlevel facility. The closing will<br />\nenable the Aquarium to do a<br />\nthorough \"housecleaning\" and<br />\ngeneral overhaul in preparation<br />\nfor the holiday season and the<br />\nnew year.<br />\nAccording to the aquarium's<br />\nacting director William Flynn,<br />\nSr., the reconditioning will<br />\nenable the Aquarium to deal<br />\nwith the results of its fantastic<br />\nsuccess\u2014heavy and almost constant use of the building by a<br />\ntotal of 3.5 million visitors.<br />\nDuring the reconditioning<br />\nperiod, the Aquarium will refine the decorative, graphic,<br />\nand mechanical aspects of exhibits, upgrade visitor areas,<br />\nand complete the last stage of<br />\nthe members' entrance re-design.<br />\nAmong the scheduled exhibit<br />\nrepairs are two major improvements\u2014repainting of the Ma-<br /><br />\nrine Mammal Tray and alterations in the Amazon Rain Forest. The alterations to the rain<br />\nforest exhibit will lay the<br />\ngroundwork for an additional<br />\ndisplay, scheduled for installation in Spring 1984.<br />\nGeneral improvements in the<br />\nvisitor areas, including the<br />\nreplacement of some flooring<br />\nand the repainting of handrails,<br />\nwill keep the facility in peak<br />\ncondition for future visitors. A<br />\nre-designed members' entrance,<br />\nequipped with a glass-enclosed<br />\nvestibule and electrically operated sliding doors, will make it<br />\neasier for handicapped visitors<br />\nand members to enter the building and protect them from inclement weather. \"The reconditioning will help the Aquarium maintain its reputation as<br />\none of the most attractive and<br />\nsophisticated facilities of its<br />\nkind in the world,\" explains<br />\nAquarium Chairman of the<br />\nBoard Neal Borden.\"We want<br />\nto do _everything necessary to<br />\noffer the highest quality recreational and educational experience to the public.\"<br /><br />\nEAM Strives To Educate Public About Epilepsy<br />\nby Jay Schneider<br />\nIn the United States, there<br />\nare more than two million epileptics, or nearly one percent of<br />\nthe country's population. Each<br />\nYear 100,000 new cases are reported, mostly among children.<br />\nAbout 40,000 Maryland residents are epileptics. The Epilepsy Association of Maryland<br />\n(EAM)is located at 3121 Saint<br />\nPaul Street. Its purpose is to<br />\naddress the major problems<br />\nthat epileptics have. It is affiliated with the Epilepsy Foundation of America, which has<br />\na national office located in<br />\nWashington, D.C. EAM provides a variety of services for its<br />\nclients.<br />\nThe Training and Placement<br />\nService assists epileptics in finding and keeping long-term emPloyment. Epilepsy, as a handi-<br /><br />\ncap, has the highest unemployment; many employers are reluctant to hire epileptics. A<br />\nrelated problem to that of finding employment is the difficulty of obtaining insurance. Recently, it has become easier for<br />\nepileptics to obtain coverage,<br />\nbut they are subject to exclusions for any claims related to<br />\nepilepsy.<br />\nEAM runs a program in the<br />\nBaltimore City School System<br />\nwhose purpose is to identify<br />\nthose students, fourteen or<br />\nolder, who have epilepsy. Once<br />\nthey are identified, the students<br />\ncan obtain proper medical and<br />\nsocial care.<br />\nA variety of counseling services are provided by EAM.<br />\nThere is a self-help group that<br />\nmeets monthly. It is similar in<br />\nits set-up to Alcoholics Anonymous; both rely upon the ideas<br /><br />\nof peer counseling and the<br />\ntraining of people to be peer<br />\nleaders.<br />\nIndividual counseling of epileptics is also available. Often,<br />\nclients come through referrals<br />\nfrom doctors. Some clients who<br />\nhave already gone_ to government social service agencies<br />\nfind that EAM is their last<br />\nresort, after the government<br />\nagency referred them to EAM.<br />\nOnce the client arrives, he sees<br />\na counselor, and the epileptic's<br />\nsocial, psychological, and medical needs are assessed. No<br />\nmedical diagnoses are made on<br />\nthe premises; instead the client<br />\nis referred to a doctor or a<br />\nneurologist.<br />\nEAM provides professional<br />\ntraining for teachers, nurses,<br />\nsocial workers, and emergency<br />\nmedical teams. The staff also<br />\nhelps epileptics locate social,<br /><br />\nmedical, and educational assistance or assistance in other<br />\nareas that may not be available<br />\nat the Baltimore City location.<br />\nOne of the major ongoing<br />\npurposes of EAM is to educate<br />\nthe general public about epilepsy and to dispel the various<br />\nmyths surrounding it. Epilpesy<br />\nwas once thought to be caused<br />\nby demonic possession. Many<br />\npeople connected epilepsy with<br />\ninsanity. Only three years ago,<br />\nat a county fair in Hagerstown<br />\nwhere EAM had a booth, people congregated in front of the<br />\nbooth, praying for the demons<br />\nto leave the bodies of the<br />\nepileptics.<br />\nIn reality, epilepsy is a<br />\nmanifestation of excessive and<br />\nsynchronous electrical discharges of a large number of cerebral neurons. Epilepsy itself is<br />\nnot a disease; rather, it is the<br /><br />\nmanifestation of one or more il\u2014<br />\nlnesses. Epilepsy can be caused<br />\nby head trauma at birth, meningitis, brain tumors, brain injuries, brain abscesses, and<br />\nrelated I occur,rences.The outward signs of epilepsy may not<br />\nbecome obvious until years<br />\nafter the injury was sustained,<br />\nor after the illness has run its<br />\ncourse. Any number of things<br />\ncould trigger a seizure, such as<br />\nfatigue, extreme cold, consumption of alcohol, or lack of<br />\nmedication. Medication can<br />\ntotally control the seizures of<br />\napproximately fifty percent of<br />\nepileptics. Another thirty percent have their seizures partially controlled, while the Epilepsy Foundation of America estimates twenty percent of all<br />\nepileptics are not taking medication, and their seizures are<br />\nnot controlled.<br /><br />\n10/OCTOBER 14, 1983<br /><br />\nArts<br /><br />\nby Er<br /><br />\nThe Bus Stops Here<br />\nby Maria Howell and<br />\nJ.E. Green<br />\nWilliam Inge's play Bus<br />\nStop, currently playing at the<br />\nSpotlighters Theatre, is well<br />\nworth seeing. This is an excellent community theater production of a bitter-sweet<br />\ncomedy.<br />\nThe action of the play takes<br />\nplace in a small cafe just outisde<br />\nof Kansas City, presumably in<br />\nthe late 1950's (the costuming<br />\nis very inconsistent in regard to<br />\nthe period). The cafe is, in effect, a bus stop where the bus<br />\nfrom Kansas City to Topeka<br />\nstops for 20 minutes to pick up'<br />\npassengers.<br />\nThe play begins about 1:00<br />\na.m. on a night in early March.<br />\nUnseasonably bad weather closes the main road and forces the<br />\nbus to stay at the cafe longer<br />\nthan the scheduled 20 minutes.<br />\nA motley collection of passengers gets off the bus and congregates in the cafe for the<br /><br />\nduration. The rest of the play<br />\ndeals with the relationships and<br />\ninteractions among the various<br />\ncharacters, all of whom are<br />\nlonely either because of their<br />\nlocation or situation.<br />\nFine performances were<br />\nturned in by each of the players. In particular, Tom Blair as<br />\nthe guardian cowboy and Dena<br />\nLuebke as the backwoods singer were compelling from start<br />\nto finish. Miss Luebke's off-key<br />\nrendition of All of Me added<br />\nthat much more to her touching<br />\nportrayal of a lonely 19-yearold country girl trying to cut it<br />\nin the \"big city\". Blair's<br />\ncharacter, although one of few<br />\nlines, was a striking presence on<br />\nstage, thanks to his quiet skill.<br />\nHe is a controlled actor who<br />\ncertainly knows his craft.<br />\nAlso deserving mention are<br />\nAmy Hoffman as the young<br />\nwaitress and Audrey Herman as<br />\nthe husky voiced cafe-owner(a<br />\nrole she played 20 years ago<br />\nwhen the Spotlighters opened<br /><br />\nwith this same show). Early in<br />\nthe play, Kevin Sharun, as the<br />\nrambunctious cowboy, was<br />\nstereotypical in his portrayal of<br />\nthe adolescent experiencing<br />\ngrowing pains. This, however,<br />\npassed quickly and he presented<br /><br />\nthe audience with a wonderful<br />\ncharacterization of a slightly<br />\ngawky but sincere youth.<br />\nBill Gavin, as the Sheriff,<br />\nwas very good in his portrayal<br />\nof fatherly concern. His position as a figure of authority was<br />\nnot apparent in his behavior<br />\nuntil the end of the second act.<br />\nLarry Ilase played the jaded<br />\nprofessor deftly, but was sometimes difficult to understand.<br /><br />\nAll of these are however,<br />\nminor complaints when brought<br />\ninto the perspective of the entire production, Bus Stop,<br />\nwhich combines good direction, set, and acting into a fine<br />\nevening at the theater.<br />\nForfurther information, see the<br />\nArts Calendar.<br /><br />\nJoseph and the Amazing<br />\nTechnicolor Dream Coat: The<br />\nBroadway musical hit written<br />\nby Andrew Loyd Webster and<br />\nTim Rice (of Jesus Christ<br />\nSuperstar and Evita fame),<br />\n\"Joseph is the joyous musical<br />\nversion of the Old Testament<br />\nJoseph story.

Just another<br />\nMTV band, I thought\u2014shmaltzy designer costumes, toughguy makeup\u2014all style and no<br />\nsubstance. But as soon as I<br />\nheard the first few minutes of<br />\nthe album, I realized that Wide<br />\nBoy Awake is a \"Nu-Musik\"<br />\nband with a difference. Unlike<br />\nCulture Club, Duran Duran,<br />\nand the rest of the Glitz-Blitz<br />\ncrowd, this highly fashionable<br />\nfoursome has muscial talent as<br />\nwell as good looks.<br />\nWide Boy Awake was founded by former Ant Kevin Mooney. Adam's influence, both<br />\nmusical and visual, is readily<br />\napparent. The rhythms and<br />\nmusic, drawing from a wide<br />\nrange of sources including<br />\nCaribbean, African, Cajun,<br />\nand even Country music, are<br />\noften reminiscent of the better<br />\nmusic from the Ant's early albums. Yet there is also a freshness and originality to Wide<br />\nBoy Awake's music that is generally lacking among the better<br />\nknown Adam Ant clone bands.<br />\nThis self-titled debut record,<br />\na five song e.p., begins with the<br />\nWide Boy Awake MTV and<br />\nclub hit, Chicken Outlaw.<br />\nOpening with a pounding syn-<br /><br />\nthesiser and drum beat, this irresistably danceable song<br />\nbreaks out into a techno-Creole<br />\nfoot-stomper. Another Cajunesque romp, Bona Venture, is<br />\nwithout a doubt the best dance<br />\nsong of the year. Sounding a<br />\nlittle like the Clash's Let's Go<br />\nCrazy with added fiddle, this<br />\ntune is enough to make even the<br />\nmost hardcore D-leveler jump<br />\nup from his seat and make like<br />\nFred Astaire.<br />\nWhile none of the other<br />\nsongs on this record are quite so<br />\nrousing, they are at least much<br />\nbetter examples of synth-funk<br />\nthan most other \"nu-musik\"<br />\nbands are providing. Slang<br />\nTeacher, for example, another<br />\nclub hit, packs just enough<br />\npunch to keep it from droning.<br />\nHopefully, future releases from<br />\nW.B.A. will lean more heavily<br />\non the Caribbean and Cajun influences and shy away from the<br />\nmore bland techno-pop shlock.<br />\nWhat about the lyrics? Who<br />\nknows? And who cares? This<br />\nmusic is for dancing, not thinking. For all I know, the words<br />\nmay be just as clever as the<br />\nmusic. But I was having too<br />\nmuch fun enjoying dancing to<br />\nthis record to sit down and concentrate on what it was saying.<br />\nIn short, Wide Boy Awake<br />\nmay just be the best dance band<br />\nto come out of the Video Revolution. Their debut album certainly is the most fun.<br /><br />\ncont. from p. 10<br />\nAuditorium at the Walters Art<br />\nGallery. Tickets are $4.00 with<br />\nstudent I.D.
