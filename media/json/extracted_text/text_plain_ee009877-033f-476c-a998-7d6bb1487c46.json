It is in the island<br />\nof Java, where Buddhism came to<br />\nhave great strength. It was completed in the sixth century, and was<br />\nused for two centuries. Then, however, with the spread of Mohammedanism, it was deserted. Off and<br />\non for a century or two it was in<br />\nuse, then entirely neglected.<br />\nDiscovered by English<br />\n<br />\nIn the early part of the nineteenth<br />\ncentury it was discovered by the<br />\nEnglish, but nothing was done for<br />\nits restoration. In 1907, however,<br />\nthe Dutch government appropriated<br />\nIiioney for its restoration, and architects were sent out to study the<br />\nbuilding, which was practically in<br />\nruins.<br />\n\"This old temple,\" Dr. Diez<br />\npointed out, \"is one of the great<br />\nmonuments of the world.\" It is<br />\nbuilt in the old original style of architecture: terrace on terrace.

It is in the island<br />\nof Java, where Buddhism came to<br />\nhave great strength. It was completed in the sixth century, and was<br />\nused for two centuries. Then, however, with the spread of Mohammedanism, it was deserted. Off and<br />\non for a century or two it was in<br />\nuse, then entirely neglected.<br />\nDiscovered by English<br /><br />\nIn the early part of the nineteenth<br />\ncentury it was discovered by the<br />\nEnglish, but nothing was done for<br />\nits restoration. In 1907, however,<br />\nthe Dutch government appropriated<br />\nIiioney for its restoration, and architects were sent out to study the<br />\nbuilding, which was practically in<br />\nruins.<br />\n\"This old temple,\" Dr. Diez<br />\npointed out, \"is one of the great<br />\nmonuments of the world.\" It is<br />\nbuilt in the old original style of architecture: terrace on terrace. It<br />\nis composed of eight of thest. te rraces, five of them square, the others<br />\ncircular. This change from square<br /><br />\nRepresenting<br /><br />\nThe Mutual Life Insurance Co. of N.
