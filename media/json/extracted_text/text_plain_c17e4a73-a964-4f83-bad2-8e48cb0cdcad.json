Entertainment,<br />\ncultural events, and student<br />\nactivities are readily available,<br />\nbut initiative to participate must<br />\ncome from the student. By the<br />\nsame token, if students discover<br />\nan area of interest not formally<br />\norganized, they are encouraged<br />\nto -share their enthusiasm and<br />\nform a new club or program.\"<br />\nJHU Circular<br />\n\"You been telling me you're a<br />\ngenius since you were seventeen/<br />\nAll this time I've known you still<br />\ndon't know what you mean/The<br />\nweekend at the college didn't<br />\nWork out like you planned/These<br />\nthings that pass for knowledge I<br />\ncan't understand<br />\nSteely Dan,\"Reelin'in the Years''<br />\nFor one thing, it wasn't a<br />\nweekend. More like a weekday.<br />\nExcept stretched out to fill five<br />\nsemesters. Maybe I should title<br />\nthis \"Tuesday at Hopkins.\"<br />\nPassing for knowledge. Now<br />\nthere's something juicy. I never<br />\nbelieved in grades much. Like<br />\nmost students, early in my<br />\ncollegiate career I worked hard to<br />\nmake good grades. To 'make the<br />\ngrade,' as ROTC propaganda<br />\nmight say. Even then I didn't<br />\nreally believe in the idea of a<br />\nsingle letter measuring your<br />\nperformance in a fifteen week<br />\ncourse. Still, they exist and<br />\ngraduate schools do look at them<br />\nand they are important. It<br />\ndoesn't hurt to have some aces in<br />\nthe hole.<br />\nWiat's far more crucial about<br />\ngrades is how you react to them.<br />\nihe pre-med that can make a<br />\ngood case for grades and their<br />\nimportance is worth more than<br />\nthe lofty philosophy major, who<br />\ndespises grading but can't<br />\narticulate his hatred or suggest<br />\nalternatives.<br />\nThere is no question grades<br />\ncan not accurately measure what<br />\nis learned in a course. The most<br />\nvaluable lessons I had were in a<br />\ntheoretical mechanics course in<br />\nmy junior year. The professor<br />\ncame in, lectured only on the<br />\nPoints the class didn't<br />\nunderstand, and left the rest to<br />\nus. I worked like hell, learned<br />\nmuch more about Newtonian<br />\nmechanics than I ever care to<br />\nknow, and aced it. Many Sunday<br />\nafternoons were spent that<br />\nsemester listening to Dylan's<br />\nBlonde on Blonde,\" cranking<br />\nout that damn homework. As the<br />\nProfessor gave us our course<br />\ngrades when he handed back the<br />\nfinals on the last day of class he<br />\nsaid one of the wisest things I<br />\nhave ever heard from a bearer of<br />\nprofessorial hoodlumship :<br />\nCongratulations.\"J ust like that.<br />\nI mpartial, cleanly acknowledging<br />\nmy triumph over self. Over self. I<br />\ndidn't force some physics major<br />\nout of grad school. I didn't drive<br />\nsome dedicated scientist-to-be to<br />\nthe brink. I just got there from<br />\nhere.<br />\nI think'of all the wasted hours<br />\nin the classroom, taking random<br />\nnotes. Constructing Portraits of<br />\nthe Professor as an Educator. Not<br />\nalways pitiably dull. Occasionally<br />\na paper topic will excite me,such<br />\n<br />\nas \"The Development of a<br />\nCommittee Interaction Analysis<br />\nSystem\" or \"A Dynamic<br />\nCost -Benefit Analysis of<br />\nParimutuel Takeout in Maryland<br />\nRacing.\"<br />\nIs it worth it? Rest assured<br />\nthat those wasted lectures were<br />\nnot totally lost. Check this logic<br />\nout: By not paying Hopkins a<br />\ncent and auditing the same<br />\ncourses a regular student is taking<br />\nfor credit, one can theoretically<br />\nget the same education as the<br />\nregular student. Therefore, isn't<br />\nthe price of admission simply the<br />\nprice of having credits on record<br />\nand ultimately the price of the<br />\ndiploma? No great revelation but<br />\nwhat it means is that higher<br />\neducation these days is an<br />\ninvestment, and not much more.<br />\nEnough of the thin-air<br />\neducational journals and the New<br />\nYork Review of Books. What<br />\nabout Hopkins as a university?<br />\nWhy did you come to JHU,little<br />\nman?<br />\nHopkins isn't second-rate as a<br />\nuniversity, but it ain't Harvard. It<br />\nis 11<br />\n2 rate. Has it the potential to<br />\n/<br />\nbe the Harvard of the eighties or<br />\nnineties or whatever? Certainly,<br />\nunder the spectacularly<br />\ncompetent hold of Steven Muller.<br />\nProblem is, the school can also<br />\ncollapse if it isn't taken care of.<br />\nIt has to be babied, nurtured.<br />\nBuild a student union every few<br />\nyears to keep the students<br />\ninebriated. Take a Peabody<br />\nInstitute here and there.

But you<br />\nget educated , you get street<br />\nsense. You pay your dues- tuition<br />\nin the School of Hard Knocks.<br />\nI believe, like Mark Twain and<br />\nRobert Blake, that schooling is<br />\ngotten in the classroom and<br />\n<br />\nphone bills each month, but<br />\nthat's one way, probably.the best<br />\nway, to learn how. Most of the<br />\nbetter cou ses at Hopkins are in<br />\nthis tradition- lab type courses.<br />\nWhile film theory may be easy,<br />\nto pass you gotta hold the<br />\n<br />\ncamera in your hand and press<br />\nthat button. Cut that film, lay a<br />\nsoundtrack. There are no<br />\nprevious exams on file in the<br />\nreading room, no grad students<br />\ngiving out ideas for papers. Just<br />\nyou and yourself and the<br />\nphysicality of film.<br />\nHopkins provides lots of<br />\nopportunities along this line<br />\noutside the classroom. You<br />\nsnicker? Try getting out and<br />\ndigging in the dirt. Write for<br />\nCourse Evaluation. Tutor an<br />\ninner-city kid for the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice. Work on a Student<br />\nCouncil committee.

Its success stems from<br />\nits extremely witty<br />\nbut frightening: dialogue 'which<br />\nhits 90% of the time and the way<br />\nin which Medoff induces tension<br />\nto an almost dangerous degree.<br />\nThe setting is a diner in<br />\nSouthern New Mexico at the end<br />\nof the sixties. The sixties are<br />\nprevalent in the sickening songs<br />\nthe jukebox plays, but is the<br />\nlatter part of the decade when<br />\nVietnam hovered over us along<br />\nwith an ineffectual government,<br />\nstudent unrest, and a dying<br />\ninterest in peace movements, or<br />\nany movements for that matter.<br />\nIt is time absent of heros,<br />\nfictional or actual, and a general<br />\ndisillusionment with this loss of<br />\nfaith.<br />\nEnter Steven (nicknamed<br />\nRed), the George Willard of this<br />\nNew Mexico town, tired of<br />\nworking the graveyard shift, tired<br />\nof the. girl who works the day<br />\nshift and his boss whom he hates<br />\nbut does not-have the guts to tell<br />\noff. Then comes Angel, a pudgy<br />\ndiner waittress who is torn<br />\nbetween her desire for Red to<br />\nbecome someone and her desire<br />\nfor him to stay, and her desire to<br />\ndo something with her own<br />\ntrivial existence. Lyle, owner of<br />\nthe local gas station, strolls in<br />\noccassionally for some<br />\nmidwestern philosophy and<br />\nadvice. Clark, the owner of the<br />\ndiner who cares less about human<br />\nlives than about how much<br />\nchange may be missing from the<br />\nregister Claires,se and Richard who<br />\nmake the unfortunate mistake of<br />\nstopping off at this particular<br />\ndiner on their way to California,<br />\nwho discover their own<br />\ninadequacies; and Teddy and<br />\nCheryl, two lost youths out for.<br />\nmoney and blood to complete<br />\ntheir delivery of dope.<br />\nAll these characters are losers,<br />\nsomehow crippled and incapable<br />\nof leading normal lives. Stephen<br />\nis an artifact from the fifties<br />\nwith his hair slicked back and<br />\nrolled up sleeves, and whose one<br />\npossession is a copy of Playboy.<br />\nAngel is homely and not very<br />\nbright; Teddy tells her point<br />\nblank that no one will ever marry<br />\nher.

The question is shockingly<br />\nraised, what 'makes Teddy more<br />\nirrational than the others?<br />\nThe acting ranges from poor to<br />\nexceptional. Michael Medeiros is<br />\nbrilliant as Teddy. The character<br />\ncalls for someone to be in total<br />\ncontrol of the stage and Mr.<br />\nMedeiros goes one step further:<br />\nhe is in total command of the<br />\naudience. His behavior is<br />\nextremely unpredictable, and<br />\nwhen the audience laughs it is<br />\nnervous laughter, they are as<br />\ntense as the victoms on stage.<br />\nDan Diggles, who was so fine in<br />\nShe Stoops to Conquer, was<br />\nequally fine in his portrayal of<br />\nRichard, and Tana Hicken is<br />\nmuch more consistent as Clarisse<br />\nthan she was in She Stoops. John<br />\nStraub gives a very good<br />\nperformance as the somewhat<br />\none-dimensional Lyle, and Paul<br />\nC.

Much of this appears to<br />\nbe in the direction, where he is<br />\nasked to do some ridiculously<br />\ntrite shticks to define his<br />\ncharacter. Donna Welby (Cheryl)<br />\nused some interesting facial<br />\nexpressions in the beginning, but<br />\nwhen she finally talks it makes<br />\none glad to know her part is so<br />\nminimal.<br />\nSpecial mention must be given<br />\n<br />\nThomas G.

Have you stayed away<br />\nfrom the 1 ocal classical music<br />\nconcerts, because they seemed<br />\ntoo big, or too formal? Or have<br />\nyou stayed away because you<br />\nreally weren't sure what a<br />\nchamber music concert, or any<br />\nclassical concert, would be like?<br />\nWU, now you can go to a<br />\nconcert where you won't have to<br />\ntravel any further than the<br />\nlibrary, where you don't have to<br />\nworry about when to applaud,<br />\nand where the artist will explain<br />\nNhat is is he is doing, and will<br />\nanswer questions during the<br />\nconcert. This is because there is a<br />\ngoup at Hopkins whose idea is to<br />\nhave classical music for the<br />\nsutdents who like it, but don't<br />\nusually go to concerts; that group<br />\nis the Fine Arts Committee.<br />\nFounded last year, the<br />\nCommittee is a Student Council<br />\nsponsored group which was set<br />\nup to cover thsoe areas of the<br />\nperforming arts missed by other<br />\ncampus series.

Ganz,<br />\nwho is not quite the household<br />\nword Horowitz is, is the kind of<br />\nyoung player who is a sure bet to<br />\n-become a star. He's 16, and has<br />\nonly been studying formally<br />\nsince he was 10. Already, he is at<br />\nthe level where he's playing<br />\nChopin Ballades and Prokofiev<br />\npiano concerti; in fact, he is even<br />\nslated to give the premiere<br />\nperformance of a new piece by<br />\nChristopher K ies at this year's<br />\nPan-American Festival. As they<br />\nsay in football, this is not the<br />\nkind of play on which you'd send<br />\nin the waterboy.<br />\nIn short, the concert should be<br />\nat the very least a better way to<br />\nspend a Sunday afternoon than<br />\ndoing Calculus problems down<br />\non C Level.

More often than not, I<br />\nfound these two terms were not<br />\nsynonymous. I was told quite<br />\nclearly that the pursuit of<br />\nknowledge here was a burden<br />\nupon my own shoulders to carry,<br />\nand that even though education<br />\nwas offered, the opportunities<br />\nhad to be discovered.<br />\nThis University has the virtue<br />\nof not patronising its students.<br />\nWith the understanding that one<br />\nof its own apparent govls is to<br />\nprovide a professional product to<br />\nsociety, the student material<br />\nchosen is assumed to have the<br />\nability to know its mind, and to<br />\nact as its mind dictates. (A<br />\nphilosophical aside: Society has a<br />\nfunny way of demanding<br />\nself-knowledge if you want to get<br />\nanywhere successfuly.)<br />\nDr. Pfeffer was quoted as<br />\nsaying \"...this university is here<br />\nto do research.\" This is the key<br />\nstatement for those who are<br />\ndissatisfied with the prospect of a<br />\ndry diet of books and lectures. In<br />\n\"writing five pounds of books\", a<br />\n<br />\nprofessor necessarily must come<br />\ndown to real issues if he is to<br />\nsurvive on this campus. Is this<br />\nnot in some way a task we all<br />\nmust confront someday? To<br />\ngather facts, to digest and<br />\ninterpret them in coherent form;<br />\nto challenge the opinion of<br />\ncolleagues in the field; to build<br />\nand maintain a reputation as an<br />\nexpert; to develop a frame of<br />\nreference in which one's pursuit<br />\nrelates to society in a meaningful<br />\nway\u2014all these things and more<br />\niswhat we ourselves as<br />\nprofessionals will experience<br />\nafter graduation.<br />\nIf sought, the opportunity to<br />\nobserve at close range and in a<br />\nsmall way even participate in the<br />\nacademic fields of choice is<br />\navailable at Hopkins. It is a rare<br />\nthing to find on many campuses<br />\nthese days an attitude among<br />\nprofessors attentive towards the<br />\nneeds of individual<br />\nundergraduates interested in<br />\nbecoming deeply involved with<br />\ntheir own particular fields. I have<br />\nfound through my experiences<br />\nhere that this attitude exists. It<br />\nremains for my classmates to<br />\nmake choices as to a field they<br />\nwould like to observe and pursue<br />\nthe means with which they can<br />\ncome closer. Better than books<br />\nor lectures, research can show an<br />\nindividual what he/she would be<br />\nfacing in terms of societal<br />\ndemands on the profession. ,<br />\nThis is education, then, in the<br />\npurest sense of the word.<br />\nVera F.

Well, just the other day I<br />\nwitnessed an Argentine professor<br />\nwho was downing a German<br />\nToblerone with her Dutch Apple<br />\nYogurt, and occasionally<br />\nswallowing gulps of Ceylon<br />\nBreakfast Tea. She was talking<br />\nwith a thin, youthful Frenchman<br />\nclad in a guayabera and UFO<br />\njeans; he alternated between<br />\nslipping Spanish sardines through<br />\nhis lips, popping Finnish anise<br />\ncandies into his mouth, and<br />\ncasually sipping Prince of Wales<br />\ntea.

Stuff is<br />\nguitar giants Eric Gale and<br />\nCornell Dupree,K eyboards man<br />\nRichard Tee, bassist Gordon<br />\nEdwards, and drummers Chris<br />\nParker and Steve Gadd. Between<br />\nthem, they've backed up<br />\neveryone from Marvin Gaye to<br />\nPaul Simon,including Miles Davis<br />\nand Lena Home. How's that for<br />\neclectic?<br />\nStuff's groove is that terrain<br />\nbetween jazz, soul and blues<br />\nwhich is sometimes called R&B.<br />\nIt's mellow and bluesy, with a<br />\nkicking beat and filled with jazz<br />\nriffs. Some of the tunes should<br />\noutright pure blue, while others<br />\nseem to be excellent laid-back<br />\njazz. \"Feets,\" for example, is an<br />\nexercise in how to play blues<br />\nguitar, while \"(Can You) Get<br />\nInto This?\" features some rough,<br />\nfootstompin' piano by Richard<br />\nTee, the kind which makes Leon<br />\nRussell seem about as funky as<br />\nAlicia de Larrocha.<br />\nIn short, if you like anything<br />\nfrom Little Feat to Quincy<br />\nJ ones, you'll love Stuff.<br />\nSome People Can<br />\nDo What They Like,Island II.PS<br />\n9420<br />\nThis, the third chapter in the<br />\nRobert Palmer remake of A<br />\nSuperstar is Born, has the hero<br />\ncaught in a unfortunate<br />\nsituation. a Texas rowdy named<br />\nBoz Scaggs seems to have made<br />\noff with our man's claim to the<br />\n'King of Blue-Eyed-Soul\" title.<br />\nAs he charms his way through<br />\nsome really loaded arrangements,<br />\nanyone can see that our boy is<br />\ndestined to be the next Rock<br />\nSuperstar, if only he would sell<br />\nmore records ...<br />\nActually, as much as I like this<br />\nalbum, it still falls short of the<br />\nfirst two. This album shows<br />\nmuch potential, especially with<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\nsuch hard -driving cookers as<br />\n\"Got To Get A Grip On You (Pt<br />\n2)\" and \"Some People Can Do<br />\nWhat They Like,\" but on the<br />\nwhole, the album seems heavy<br />\nand produced.<br />\nIf only there was some lighter<br />\nmaterial, more rhythmically<br />\nsubtle, more rural sounding, and<br />\nthis album would be a sure<br />\nwinner. Still, it is pleasant, and<br />\nwill held us until either Scaggs,<br />\nLittle Feat (Palmer's backup<br />\ngroup in the studio), or Palmer<br />\nhimself come up with something<br />\nnew.<br />\nJ immy Owens Jimmy Owens<br />\nA&M Horizon SP 712<br />\nFinally, a fusion album that<br />\ndoesn't get lost in the funk.<br />\nJ immy Owens is an inventive,<br />\nenergetic soloist, who can use the<br />\n<br />\niennifer bishop<br />\n<br />\nelectric advantages of the echoplex with a musicality which<br />\ndoesn't even suggest gimmicry.<br />\nFurthermore, he has a melodic<br />\nsense which is somewhat of a<br />\nrarity in these days of screech<br />\nartists and fuzz-tone fanatics.<br />\nAnyone considering going into<br />\nthe jazz-rock field should be<br />\nrequired to listen to Owens'<br />\nversion of Ellington's \"Caravan,\"<br />\nif only to make the point that<br />\ncrossover jazz can swing. In<br />\nfact, Owens keeps up such a<br />\nsense of swing and taste that<br />\nEddie Henderson, an established<br />\nmaster of the style, sounds<br />\npositively sterile by comparison.<br />\nAs for the back-up group, the<br />\never popular K enny Barron does<br />\nan admirable job on the<br />\nkeyboards, and bassist Chris<br />\nWhite keeps the bottom funky<br />\nand cliche free.

The professor<br />\ncame in, lectured only on the<br />\nPoints the class didn't<br />\nunderstand, and left the rest to<br />\nus. I worked like hell, learned<br />\nmuch more about Newtonian<br />\nmechanics than I ever care to<br />\nknow, and aced it. Many Sunday<br />\nafternoons were spent that<br />\nsemester listening to Dylan's<br />\nBlonde on Blonde,\" cranking<br />\nout that damn homework. As the<br />\nProfessor gave us our course<br />\ngrades when he handed back the<br />\nfinals on the last day of class he<br />\nsaid one of the wisest things I<br />\nhave ever heard from a bearer of<br />\nprofessorial hoodlumship :<br />\nCongratulations.\"J ust like that.<br />\nI mpartial, cleanly acknowledging<br />\nmy triumph over self. Over self. I<br />\ndidn't force some physics major<br />\nout of grad school. I didn't drive<br />\nsome dedicated scientist-to-be to<br />\nthe brink. I just got there from<br />\nhere.<br />\nI think'of all the wasted hours<br />\nin the classroom, taking random<br />\nnotes. Constructing Portraits of<br />\nthe Professor as an Educator. Not<br />\nalways pitiably dull. Occasionally<br />\na paper topic will excite me,such<br /><br />\nas \"The Development of a<br />\nCommittee Interaction Analysis<br />\nSystem\" or \"A Dynamic<br />\nCost -Benefit Analysis of<br />\nParimutuel Takeout in Maryland<br />\nRacing.\"<br />\nIs it worth it? Rest assured<br />\nthat those wasted lectures were<br />\nnot totally lost. Check this logic<br />\nout: By not paying Hopkins a<br />\ncent and auditing the same<br />\ncourses a regular student is taking<br />\nfor credit, one can theoretically<br />\nget the same education as the<br />\nregular student. Therefore, isn't<br />\nthe price of admission simply the<br />\nprice of having credits on record<br />\nand ultimately the price of the<br />\ndiploma? No great revelation but<br />\nwhat it means is that higher<br />\neducation these days is an<br />\ninvestment, and not much more.<br />\nEnough of the thin-air<br />\neducational journals and the New<br />\nYork Review of Books. What<br />\nabout Hopkins as a university?<br />\nWhy did you come to JHU,little<br />\nman?<br />\nHopkins isn't second-rate as a<br />\nuniversity, but it ain't Harvard. It<br />\nis 11<br />\n2 rate. Has it the potential to<br />\n/<br />\nbe the Harvard of the eighties or<br />\nnineties or whatever? Certainly,<br />\nunder the spectacularly<br />\ncompetent hold of Steven Muller.<br />\nProblem is, the school can also<br />\ncollapse if it isn't taken care of.<br />\nIt has to be babied, nurtured.<br />\nBuild a student union every few<br />\nyears to keep the students<br />\ninebriated. Take a Peabody<br />\nInstitute here and there.

But you<br />\nget educated , you get street<br />\nsense. You pay your dues- tuition<br />\nin the School of Hard Knocks.<br />\nI believe, like Mark Twain and<br />\nRobert Blake, that schooling is<br />\ngotten in the classroom and<br /><br />\nphone bills each month, but<br />\nthat's one way, probably.the best<br />\nway, to learn how. Most of the<br />\nbetter cou ses at Hopkins are in<br />\nthis tradition- lab type courses.<br />\nWhile film theory may be easy,<br />\nto pass you gotta hold the<br /><br />\ncamera in your hand and press<br />\nthat button. Cut that film, lay a<br />\nsoundtrack. There are no<br />\nprevious exams on file in the<br />\nreading room, no grad students<br />\ngiving out ideas for papers. Just<br />\nyou and yourself and the<br />\nphysicality of film.<br />\nHopkins provides lots of<br />\nopportunities along this line<br />\noutside the classroom. You<br />\nsnicker? Try getting out and<br />\ndigging in the dirt. Write for<br />\nCourse Evaluation. Tutor an<br />\ninner-city kid for the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice. Work on a Student<br />\nCouncil committee.

Have you stayed away<br />\nfrom the 1 ocal classical music<br />\nconcerts, because they seemed<br />\ntoo big, or too formal? Or have<br />\nyou stayed away because you<br />\nreally weren't sure what a<br />\nchamber music concert, or any<br />\nclassical concert, would be like?<br />\nWU, now you can go to a<br />\nconcert where you won't have to<br />\ntravel any further than the<br />\nlibrary, where you don't have to<br />\nworry about when to applaud,<br />\nand where the artist will explain<br />\nNhat is is he is doing, and will<br />\nanswer questions during the<br />\nconcert. This is because there is a<br />\ngoup at Hopkins whose idea is to<br />\nhave classical music for the<br />\nsutdents who like it, but don't<br />\nusually go to concerts; that group<br />\nis the Fine Arts Committee.<br />\nFounded last year, the<br />\nCommittee is a Student Council<br />\nsponsored group which was set<br />\nup to cover thsoe areas of the<br />\nperforming arts missed by other<br />\ncampus series.

More often than not, I<br />\nfound these two terms were not<br />\nsynonymous.

(A<br />\nphilosophical aside: Society has a<br />\nfunny way of demanding<br />\nself-knowledge if you want to get<br />\nanywhere successfuly.)<br />\nDr. Pfeffer was quoted as<br />\nsaying \"...this university is here<br />\nto do research.\" This is the key<br />\nstatement for those who are<br />\ndissatisfied with the prospect of a<br />\ndry diet of books and lectures. In<br />\n\"writing five pounds of books\", a<br /><br />\nprofessor necessarily must come<br />\ndown to real issues if he is to<br />\nsurvive on this campus. Is this<br />\nnot in some way a task we all<br />\nmust confront someday? To<br />\ngather facts, to digest and<br />\ninterpret them in coherent form;<br />\nto challenge the opinion of<br />\ncolleagues in the field; to build<br />\nand maintain a reputation as an<br />\nexpert; to develop a frame of<br />\nreference in which one's pursuit<br />\nrelates to society in a meaningful<br />\nway\u2014all these things and more<br />\niswhat we ourselves as<br />\nprofessionals will experience<br />\nafter graduation.<br />\nIf sought, the opportunity to<br />\nobserve at close range and in a<br />\nsmall way even participate in the<br />\nacademic fields of choice is<br />\navailable at Hopkins. It is a rare<br />\nthing to find on many campuses<br />\nthese days an attitude among<br />\nprofessors attentive towards the<br />\nneeds of individual<br />\nundergraduates interested in<br />\nbecoming deeply involved with<br />\ntheir own particular fields. I have<br />\nfound through my experiences<br />\nhere that this attitude exists. It<br />\nremains for my classmates to<br />\nmake choices as to a field they<br />\nwould like to observe and pursue<br />\nthe means with which they can<br />\ncome closer. Better than books<br />\nor lectures, research can show an<br />\nindividual what he/she would be<br />\nfacing in terms of societal<br />\ndemands on the profession. ,<br />\nThis is education, then, in the<br />\npurest sense of the word.<br />\nVera F.

Well, just the other day I<br />\nwitnessed an Argentine professor<br />\nwho was downing a German<br />\nToblerone with her Dutch Apple<br />\nYogurt, and occasionally<br />\nswallowing gulps of Ceylon<br />\nBreakfast Tea. She was talking<br />\nwith a thin, youthful Frenchman<br />\nclad in a guayabera and UFO<br />\njeans; he alternated between<br />\nslipping Spanish sardines through<br />\nhis lips, popping Finnish anise<br />\ncandies into his mouth, and<br />\ncasually sipping Prince of Wales<br />\ntea. They were soon joined by a<br />\nblond Italian who began to<br />\nspread Austrian Alps cheese onto<br />\nhis Massachusetts Banana Chips<br />\n(though the bananas surely<br />\noriginated in South America),<br />\nthen balanced a Canard and<br />\nBowsers English Licorice Toffee<br />\nFinger on top, and finally<br />\ncrammed the entire<br /><br />\nconglomeration into an operatic<br />\nmouth.
