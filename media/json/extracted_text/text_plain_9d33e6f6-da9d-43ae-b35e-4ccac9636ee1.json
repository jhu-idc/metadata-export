As the newly selected<br />\ncontinuous<br />\nstaff prepares itself to enter our 65th year of<br />\npublication, a restatement of policy and aims is in order.<br />\nFirst, the News-Letter fully recognizes\\ its responsibility to provide full carerage for the manifold functions<br />\nHowof the various campus organizations and activities.<br />\nenthusiastic<br />\nour<br />\nprovide<br />\ncertainly<br />\nshall<br />\never, while we<br />\nsupport to worthwhile events and functions, the NewsLetter shall not degenerate into a campus publicity organ.<br />\nA balanced amount of campus news and tempered criticism<br />\n\u2022<br />\nshall be maintained.<br />\nas accunews<br />\nreport<br />\nto<br />\nmade<br />\nbe<br />\nwill<br />\nEvery attempt<br />\nReaders<br />\npossible.<br />\nreasonably<br />\nis<br />\nas<br />\nimpartially<br />\nas<br />\nand<br />\nrately<br />\nare<br />\nstories<br />\nnewspaper<br />\nmust realize, nevertheless, that<br />\ncertain<br />\na<br />\ny<br />\nconsequentl<br />\nthat<br />\nand<br />\nbeings,<br />\nwritten by human<br />\namount of interpretation of news is unavoidable. This<br />\nshould be recognized as such, and not as deliberate or<br />\nmalicious slanting of news.<br />\nThe News-Letter shall maintain tradition by taking<br />\nfirm stands on campus issues when the situations warrant<br />\nsuch editorial action. We shall break with tradition by<br />\nsupporting one candidate or the other in major campus<br />\nelections should a case arise in which the issues or personalities involved are clear cut enough.<br />\nIn a concerted attempt to improve the journalistic<br />\nquality of the paper, we shall expand our campus coverage<br />\nto encompass hitherto neglected areas such as cultural<br />\naffairs, meetings and lectures. In addition our news and<br />\nfeature columns will include items concerning off-campus<br />\nactivities of interest to Hopkins men, both in the City of<br />\nBaltimore and on other neighboring campuses.<br />\nThe manifold issues of civil liberties and racial<br />\nequality have attracted much interest on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus this year as in past years. The News-Letter shall<br />\ntry to elucidate and comment on these issues and the<br />\nactions taken thereupon in order to help bring about a<br />\ngreater degree of equality, both on and off the campus.<br />\nThis is in accordance with long' established News-Letter<br />\npolicy.<br />\nAs a final break with tradition, the News-Letter will<br />\nno longer refrain from commenting upon and taking firm<br />\nstands on major national and international issues. While<br />\nour principal function is as a campus organ, there are<br />\n,often timely issues in the daily newspapers which warrant<br />\nstudent opinion and reaction in the nature of editorials<br />\nand news analyses. This shall be a fairly regular feature<br />\nof a News-Letter truly representative of student activities,<br />\nopinion and attitudes.<br />\n<br />\nWickwire Presents<br />\n<br />\nBy MATT iCRENSON<br />\n<br />\nDr. Albert Hammond, after half a century<br />\nspent with the queen of Arts and the sport of<br />\nkings, has announced that he will retire from<br />\ndaytime teaching at Hopkins this June.<br />\nDr. Hammond, Associate Professor of Philosophy, began his association with the University<br />\nin 1910 when he arrived at the old Howard<br />\nStreet campus as a freshman.

This being the case, a<br />\nreview of the Barnstormers' \"Mr.<br />\nRoberts\" should be an exception,<br />\nat least from the writing point<br />\nof view, for it was excellently<br />\ndone\u2014so \"excellently\" that one<br />\ncould ignore the performance<br />\nand talk about the ,play itself.<br />\nBut that is not possible because<br />\nit would mean many outstanding jobs would go without deserved credit.<br />\nLester Wolf, a director wellknown on the Hopkins campus<br />\nfor his work with both Barnstormers and the Playshop,<br />\nwheedling, cajoling, threatening, whipped the cast to a keen<br />\npoint of mutual consideration,<br />\nadequacy, and that sometimesomething touch of once-overlightly so necessary in a play<br />\nby Heggins and Logan.

Another recalls the flower\u2014usually a buttercup or dandelion\u2014that he always wears in his buttonhole. An<br />\nassociate says that Dr. Hammond's unusual kindness has<br />\ncaused his colleagues to refer<br />\nto him as Saint Albert.<br />\n<br />\nThe supporting cast, led by<br />\nChips Lickson, Fred Damski,<br />\nPeter Grossman, and Richard<br />\nEsteves were especially good.<br />\nTheir scenes together and with<br />\nthe principals made the play<br />\nclip along with sustained energy<br />\nand go-go-go.<br />\nThe set was the most ambitious ever attempted in a<br />\nBarnstormers production and it<br />\nproved to be well worth the<br />\nextra time and effort exerted<br />\nby Fred Teets and very able<br />\nassistants.

Back to the colored hoods of academic robes.<br />\nA doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears<br />\ngreen, a master of arts wears white,a doctor of humanities wears<br />\ncrimson, a master of library science wears lemon yellow. Why?<br />\nWhy,for example,should a master of library science wear lemon<br />\nyellow?<br />\nWell sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to<br />\nMarch 29, 1844. On that date the first public library in the<br />\nUnited States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.<br />\nSigafoos's neighbors were of course wildly grateful-=all, that<br />\nis, except Wrex Todhunter.<br />\nMr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since.1822 when both<br />\nmen had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had<br />\nchosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.<br />\nSigafoos knew all the latest steps, like the Missouri Compromise<br />\nMambo, the Shay's Rebellion Schottische, and the James K.<br />\nPolk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all<br />\nowing to a wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans.<br />\n(He was struck by a falling praline.)<br />\nConsumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos's<br />\nlibrary, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.<br />\nThis he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr.<br />\nSigafoos.\"What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven't got?\" Mr.<br />\nTodhunter kept asking himself, and finally the answer came to<br />\nhim: books.<br />\nSo Mr.Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books<br />\nand soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.<br />\nBut Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began<br />\nserving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea<br />\nwith sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with<br />\nsugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr, Todhunter began serving<br />\ntea with sugar and cream and lemon.<br />\nThis, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. To.dhunter because he had the only lemon tree in town\u2014in fact, in the entire<br />\nstate of North Dakota\u2014and since that day lemon yellow has of<br />\ncourse been the color on the academic robes of library science.<br />\n(Incidentally, the defeated Mr.Sigafoos packed up his library<br />\nand moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There<br />\nwere, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but,<br />\nalas, there was no cream because the cow was not introduced<br />\n01961 Max Shulman<br />\nto California until 1931 by John Wayne.)<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nUNLESS<br />\n<br />\nYOU<br />\nDO!!!<br />\nThe Adler Shape-Up<br />\nis guaranteed not to<br />\nfall down or your<br />\nmoney back!

The questions were designed to test a fairly detailed<br />\nknowledge of world affairs and<br />\nto eliminate blind guessing.<br />\nSocial science majors made top<br />\nscores, followed by students in<br />\nthe humanities, biological sciences, sciences, and engineering\u2014in descending order. By<br />\nclass, seniors led, trailed by<br /><br />\njuniors, sophomores, and freshmen.<br />\nResults on individual questions raised some interesting<br />\npoints. For example, though<br />\npeace organizations and UnAmerican Activities Committee<br />\ngroups are active at Hopkins,<br />\nonly 30% of the students knew<br />\nthat the House had overwhelmingly approved and voted funds<br />\nfor the Committee.<br />\nAgain, only 30% could answer<br />\nquestions on Lao-s, the Congo,<br />\nand the U.N., all of which have<br />\nbeen very much in the news. A<br />\nsurprising 70% did not know that<br />\nLord Home is Foreign Minister<br />\nof Great Britain. Less surprising<br />\nwas the fact that 70% did not<br />\nknow that Conakry is the capi-<br /><br />\ntal of Guinea, or that John Connally is Secretary of the Navy.<br />\nThe only excuse offered for<br />\nlow scores was lack of time to<br />\nread newspapers. A few students<br />\nthought that the questions were<br />\nambiguous, but even if the average score is pro-rated for ambiguity and testing error, its<br />\nhighest level is 50%, which is not<br />\nsignificantly better.<br />\nA minor question asked for<br />\nthe name of the President of<br />\nRussia. The 70% who did not<br />\nknow the answer (Brezhnev)<br />\nguessed Vorlinskya completely<br />\nfictitious name.<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\naccess to the refreshment stands<br />\nand the dance floor.

As the newly selected<br />\ncontinuous<br />\nstaff prepares itself to enter our 65th year of<br />\npublication, a restatement of policy and aims is in order.<br />\nFirst, the News-Letter fully recognizes\\ its responsibility to provide full carerage for the manifold functions<br />\nHowof the various campus organizations and activities.<br />\nenthusiastic<br />\nour<br />\nprovide<br />\ncertainly<br />\nshall<br />\never, while we<br />\nsupport to worthwhile events and functions, the NewsLetter shall not degenerate into a campus publicity organ.<br />\nA balanced amount of campus news and tempered criticism<br />\n\u2022<br />\nshall be maintained.<br />\nas accunews<br />\nreport<br />\nto<br />\nmade<br />\nbe<br />\nwill<br />\nEvery attempt<br />\nReaders<br />\npossible.<br />\nreasonably<br />\nis<br />\nas<br />\nimpartially<br />\nas<br />\nand<br />\nrately<br />\nare<br />\nstories<br />\nnewspaper<br />\nmust realize, nevertheless, that<br />\ncertain<br />\na<br />\ny<br />\nconsequentl<br />\nthat<br />\nand<br />\nbeings,<br />\nwritten by human<br />\namount of interpretation of news is unavoidable. This<br />\nshould be recognized as such, and not as deliberate or<br />\nmalicious slanting of news.<br />\nThe News-Letter shall maintain tradition by taking<br />\nfirm stands on campus issues when the situations warrant<br />\nsuch editorial action. We shall break with tradition by<br />\nsupporting one candidate or the other in major campus<br />\nelections should a case arise in which the issues or personalities involved are clear cut enough.<br />\nIn a concerted attempt to improve the journalistic<br />\nquality of the paper, we shall expand our campus coverage<br />\nto encompass hitherto neglected areas such as cultural<br />\naffairs, meetings and lectures. In addition our news and<br />\nfeature columns will include items concerning off-campus<br />\nactivities of interest to Hopkins men, both in the City of<br />\nBaltimore and on other neighboring campuses.<br />\nThe manifold issues of civil liberties and racial<br />\nequality have attracted much interest on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus this year as in past years. The News-Letter shall<br />\ntry to elucidate and comment on these issues and the<br />\nactions taken thereupon in order to help bring about a<br />\ngreater degree of equality, both on and off the campus.<br />\nThis is in accordance with long' established News-Letter<br />\npolicy.<br />\nAs a final break with tradition, the News-Letter will<br />\nno longer refrain from commenting upon and taking firm<br />\nstands on major national and international issues. While<br />\nour principal function is as a campus organ, there are<br />\n,often timely issues in the daily newspapers which warrant<br />\nstudent opinion and reaction in the nature of editorials<br />\nand news analyses. This shall be a fairly regular feature<br />\nof a News-Letter truly representative of student activities,<br />\nopinion and attitudes.<br /><br />\nWickwire Presents<br /><br />\nBy MATT iCRENSON<br /><br />\nDr. Albert Hammond, after half a century<br />\nspent with the queen of Arts and the sport of<br />\nkings, has announced that he will retire from<br />\ndaytime teaching at Hopkins this June.<br />\nDr. Hammond, Associate Professor of Philosophy, began his association with the University<br />\nin 1910 when he arrived at the old Howard<br />\nStreet campus as a freshman. Today he recalls<br />\nthat the location at Howard and Ross Streets<br />\nwas somewhat superior to the present Homewood site in that the width of Ross Street was<br />\nideal for pitching nickels.<br />\nAs an undergraduate, Dr. Hamomnd was a<br />\nmember of the \"historical-political group\"<br />\n(there were no department majors), and he<br />\ntook the required courses\u2014English composition,<br />\nliterature, physics and philosophy, which in<br />\nthose days covered ethics, psychology, and logic<br />\nin one year.<br />\nIn 1914, he turned to teaching\u2014at first in<br />\npublic speaking and later, in philosophy.<br />\nDR.

Back to the colored hoods of academic robes.<br />\nA doctor of philosophy wears blue, a doctor of medicine wears<br />\ngreen, a master of arts wears white,a doctor of humanities wears<br />\ncrimson, a master of library science wears lemon yellow. Why?<br />\nWhy,for example,should a master of library science wear lemon<br />\nyellow?<br />\nWell sir, to answer this vexing question, we must go back to<br />\nMarch 29, 1844. On that date the first public library in the<br />\nUnited States was established by Ulric Sigafoos. All of Mr.<br />\nSigafoos's neighbors were of course wildly grateful-=all, that<br />\nis, except Wrex Todhunter.<br />\nMr. Todhunter had hated Mr. Sigafoos since.1822 when both<br />\nmen had wooed the beauteous Melanie Zitt and Melanie had<br />\nchosen Mr. Sigafoos because she was mad for dancing and Mr.<br />\nSigafoos knew all the latest steps, like the Missouri Compromise<br />\nMambo, the Shay's Rebellion Schottische, and the James K.<br />\nPolk Polka, while Mr. Todhunter, alas, could not dance at all<br />\nowing to a wound he had received at the Battle of New Orleans.<br />\n(He was struck by a falling praline.)<br />\nConsumed with jealousy at the success of Mr. Sigafoos's<br />\nlibrary, Mr. Todhunter resolved to open a competing library.<br />\nThis he did, but he lured not a single patron away from Mr.<br />\nSigafoos.\"What has Mr. Sigafoos got that I haven't got?\" Mr.<br />\nTodhunter kept asking himself, and finally the answer came to<br />\nhim: books.<br />\nSo Mr.Todhunter stocked his library with lots of dandy books<br />\nand soon he was doing more business than his hated rival.<br />\nBut Mr. Sigafoos struck back. To regain his clientele, he began<br />\nserving tea free of charge at his library every afternoon. Thereupon, Mr. Todhunter, not to be outdone, began serving tea<br />\nwith sugar. Thereupon, Mr. Sigafoos began serving tea with<br />\nsugar and cream. Thereupon, Mr, Todhunter began serving<br />\ntea with sugar and cream and lemon.<br />\nThis, of course, clinched the victory for Mr. To.dhunter because he had the only lemon tree in town\u2014in fact, in the entire<br />\nstate of North Dakota\u2014and since that day lemon yellow has of<br />\ncourse been the color on the academic robes of library science.<br />\n(Incidentally, the defeated Mr.Sigafoos packed up his library<br />\nand moved to California where, alas, he failed once more. There<br />\nwere, to be sure, plenty of lemons to serve with his tea, but,<br />\nalas, there was no cream because the cow was not introduced<br />\n01961 Max Shulman<br />\nto California until 1931 by John Wayne.)<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nUNLESS<br /><br />\nYOU<br />\nDO!!!<br />\nThe Adler Shape-Up<br />\nis guaranteed not to<br />\nfall down or your<br />\nmoney back!
