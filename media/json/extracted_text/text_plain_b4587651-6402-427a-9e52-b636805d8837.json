But<br />\nthere's a difference between<br />\nsomething not being good and<br />\nnot liking it.\" Both managers<br />\nclaim to eat the food themselves.<br />\nProphet has standard recipes<br />\nPrepared and packaged, and the<br />\nmanagers stressed that they-buy<br />\nonly U.S. Grade A canned goods<br />\n,and U.S. Choice meats.<br />\nThe problem is, as stated by<br />\nFrancesco, \"The student is used<br />\nto home cooking, and you can't<br />\nPlease everybody with<br />\ninstitutional cooking.\" But, High<br />\nexplained, \"Each day we're here<br />\nWe're getting to know what the<br />\nstudents like, and we can serve<br />\n<br />\naccordingly.\"<br />\nBob Murcko, chairman of the<br />\nFood Committee, remarked,<br />\n\"When I spoke to Mr. High in<br />\nthe beginning of the year, I told<br />\nhim if the students didn't like<br />\nthe food, he'd know about it.<br />\nIt's our mission to make sure the<br />\nstudent voice is heard.\"<br />\nCertain complaints have<br />\nalready been answered but<br />\nothers have no solution. A<br />\ntypical complaint concerns the<br />\namount of starch in the food.<br />\nFrancesco commented, \"The<br />\nstudent today is more diet<br />\nconscious, but when he makes<br />\nhis own selection, he goes heavy<br />\non starches anyway.\" He added<br />\nthat a balanced meal is served in<br />\nthe Dining Hall, containing all<br />\nseven of the basic food<br />\n_requirements.<br />\nAnother complaint was the<br />\nlength of the lines. Francesco<br />\nexplained that there was not too<br />\nmuch that could be done about<br />\nit. Food selections are pre-plated<br />\n<br />\nto speed up lines, but a sudden<br />\nflow of students slows down the<br />\nprocess.<br />\nA request was made to make<br />\nup a menu a week in advance.<br />\nand according to Francesco this<br />\nwill be 'done, subject to change<br />\ndue to the availability of<br />\nproducts.<br />\nStudents also wanted more<br />\ndesserts, and as a result pudding,<br />\njello, either pie or ice cream and<br />\nfresh fruit are now available.<br />\nMurcko stated the purpose of<br />\nthe Food Committee is to bring<br />\nstudent complaints to Prophet,<br />\nand to see that they hold up to<br />\nall parts of their contract.<br />\nThe committee will also<br />\ninvestigate the nutritional value<br />\nof the food served and the<br />\nmethod of preparation.<br />\nAll suggestions and<br />\ncomplaints will be heard Friday<br />\nevenings in the Dining Hall.<br />\nThey will then be discussed with<br />\nthe manager of Prophet to seek<br />\nimprovements.<br />\n<br />\nLevering Hall as it appearal after completion in 1929<br />\nbegin next week and it will be<br />\ndone through Mr. McElwee's<br />\noffice and in conjunction with<br />\nthe cominittee.

It seems that there are so few people graduating<br />\nor entering the program that it is not meeting Federal<br />\nrequirements. ROTC director Col. Eleazor Parmly may<br />\neven recommend the ending of the program if the<br />\ngraduating class falls below 15, as it seems likely to do<br />\nwithin the next year or two.<br />\nAll those guerilla theaters, leaflets, committees and<br />\nangry statements have not done as much to kill ROTC as<br />\nsuch mundane items as the loss of academic credit or lack<br />\nof scholarships. Of course, protests created the<br />\nanti-military attitudes which helped make ROTC cadets<br />\nfeel like pariahs. Nationally, freshman enrollment in the<br />\nthree ROTC branches has dropped 70 percent.<br />\nThe hostility to the military is among the most welcome<br />\nchanges in values of recent years, and the gradual death of<br />\nthe ROTC program is a cause for hope. But efforts by<br />\nsome educational organizations to \"reform\" ROTC are<br />\nboth useless and harmful; institutions as deep-rooted and<br />\ndestructive as the military are not changed by the addition<br />\nof some college-trained officers.<br />\nWe should not, of course, simply wait for Parmly to<br />\ndecree the end of ROTC when he gets around to it in a few<br />\nyears. Constant pressure needs to be applied so that all of<br />\nthe University's ties to the military are ended.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment funding<br />\nIt is now official that the student strike of spring 1970<br />\nwas an absurd exercise of frustration. Despite the apparent<br />\nsweeping victory of the referendum which threw military<br />\nrecruiting off campus, despite the seeming radicalization of<br />\nan otherwise apathetic campus, revelations this week show<br />\nthat all of the activity was for naught. The students who<br />\nparticipated in that struggle understood and didn't object<br />\nwhen actions by a military-oriented Congress forced<br />\nHopkins to reinstate military recruiting, but everyone<br />\ninvolved, radicals and trustees alike, pointed to the bigger<br />\nproblem that caused the difficulty, the University's<br />\nincreasing financial dependence on government funds.<br />\nThus, in the soberest of terms, the Board and President<br />\nGordon ordered a study made of Hopkins' ties with the<br />\ngovernment. A step in the right direction, at least. But now<br />\nwe find out that even that small step is being ignored. A<br />\npresidential assistant apparently re-copied a few<br />\nNews-Letter articles and tried to pass it off as the<br />\nlarge-scale study, but even the Provost admitted that this<br />\nwould not do, adding that the current administration has<br />\nno plans for pursuing the idea. And so Hopkins will<br />\ncontinue to depend on the government for over half of its<br />\nbudget, and the next time a crisis arises, perhaps another<br />\nstudy will be commissioned. Even when students point out<br />\nproblems that are generally agreed to be issues worthy of<br />\nstudy, their efforts turn out to be in vain.<br />\n<br />\nSept. 21, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 6<br />\n<br />\nWalled Off<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIt is a shame that the<br />\nNews-Letter saw merit in the<br />\nOne View expressed by Warren<br />\nGulin.

Unlike<br />\nLevering Hall where each meal is<br />\nPaid for separately, the Dining<br />\nHall has a mandatory food fee<br />\ncovering all meals for the year,<br />\nthus assuring the food<br />\ncontractor of a certain income.<br />\nM. P. Francesco, city-manager<br />\nof Prophet, commented on the<br />\nfood quality, \"There exists an<br />\ninternal problem of re-training<br />\nthe employees to prepare food<br />\nin an adequate manner.\"<br />\nAt this time, Prophet has no<br />\nfinancial statement to release.<br />\nFrancesco explained that they<br />\nhave not been here long enough<br />\nto be able to comment on their<br />\nfinancial status.<br />\nThe Food Committee of the<br />\nDormitory Student's<br />\nRepresentative Council is<br />\ncollecting proposals and<br />\nopinions and will present them<br />\nto Prophet in the near future.<br />\nAccording to Francesco, Prophet<br />\nwants to work with the Food<br />\nCommittee to find out What the<br />\nstudents want.<br />\nRay High, manager, said<br />\nWhenever you deal with the<br />\nPublic, you have problems. But<br />\nthere's a difference between<br />\nsomething not being good and<br />\nnot liking it.\" Both managers<br />\nclaim to eat the food themselves.<br />\nProphet has standard recipes<br />\nPrepared and packaged, and the<br />\nmanagers stressed that they-buy<br />\nonly U.S. Grade A canned goods<br />\n,and U.S. Choice meats.<br />\nThe problem is, as stated by<br />\nFrancesco, \"The student is used<br />\nto home cooking, and you can't<br />\nPlease everybody with<br />\ninstitutional cooking.\" But, High<br />\nexplained, \"Each day we're here<br />\nWe're getting to know what the<br />\nstudents like, and we can serve<br /><br />\naccordingly.\"<br />\nBob Murcko, chairman of the<br />\nFood Committee, remarked,<br />\n\"When I spoke to Mr. High in<br />\nthe beginning of the year, I told<br />\nhim if the students didn't like<br />\nthe food, he'd know about it.<br />\nIt's our mission to make sure the<br />\nstudent voice is heard.\"<br />\nCertain complaints have<br />\nalready been answered but<br />\nothers have no solution. A<br />\ntypical complaint concerns the<br />\namount of starch in the food.<br />\nFrancesco commented, \"The<br />\nstudent today is more diet<br />\nconscious, but when he makes<br />\nhis own selection, he goes heavy<br />\non starches anyway.\" He added<br />\nthat a balanced meal is served in<br />\nthe Dining Hall, containing all<br />\nseven of the basic food<br />\n_requirements.<br />\nAnother complaint was the<br />\nlength of the lines. Francesco<br />\nexplained that there was not too<br />\nmuch that could be done about<br />\nit. Food selections are pre-plated<br /><br />\nto speed up lines, but a sudden<br />\nflow of students slows down the<br />\nprocess.<br />\nA request was made to make<br />\nup a menu a week in advance.<br />\nand according to Francesco this<br />\nwill be 'done, subject to change<br />\ndue to the availability of<br />\nproducts.<br />\nStudents also wanted more<br />\ndesserts, and as a result pudding,<br />\njello, either pie or ice cream and<br />\nfresh fruit are now available.<br />\nMurcko stated the purpose of<br />\nthe Food Committee is to bring<br />\nstudent complaints to Prophet,<br />\nand to see that they hold up to<br />\nall parts of their contract.<br />\nThe committee will also<br />\ninvestigate the nutritional value<br />\nof the food served and the<br />\nmethod of preparation.<br />\nAll suggestions and<br />\ncomplaints will be heard Friday<br />\nevenings in the Dining Hall.<br />\nThey will then be discussed with<br />\nthe manager of Prophet to seek<br />\nimprovements.<br /><br />\nLevering Hall as it appearal after completion in 1929<br />\nbegin next week and it will be<br />\ndone through Mr. McElwee's<br />\noffice and in conjunction with<br />\nthe cominittee.

It seems that there are so few people graduating<br />\nor entering the program that it is not meeting Federal<br />\nrequirements. ROTC director Col. Eleazor Parmly may<br />\neven recommend the ending of the program if the<br />\ngraduating class falls below 15, as it seems likely to do<br />\nwithin the next year or two.<br />\nAll those guerilla theaters, leaflets, committees and<br />\nangry statements have not done as much to kill ROTC as<br />\nsuch mundane items as the loss of academic credit or lack<br />\nof scholarships. Of course, protests created the<br />\nanti-military attitudes which helped make ROTC cadets<br />\nfeel like pariahs. Nationally, freshman enrollment in the<br />\nthree ROTC branches has dropped 70 percent.<br />\nThe hostility to the military is among the most welcome<br />\nchanges in values of recent years, and the gradual death of<br />\nthe ROTC program is a cause for hope. But efforts by<br />\nsome educational organizations to \"reform\" ROTC are<br />\nboth useless and harmful; institutions as deep-rooted and<br />\ndestructive as the military are not changed by the addition<br />\nof some college-trained officers.<br />\nWe should not, of course, simply wait for Parmly to<br />\ndecree the end of ROTC when he gets around to it in a few<br />\nyears. Constant pressure needs to be applied so that all of<br />\nthe University's ties to the military are ended.<br /><br />\nGovernment funding<br />\nIt is now official that the student strike of spring 1970<br />\nwas an absurd exercise of frustration. Despite the apparent<br />\nsweeping victory of the referendum which threw military<br />\nrecruiting off campus, despite the seeming radicalization of<br />\nan otherwise apathetic campus, revelations this week show<br />\nthat all of the activity was for naught. The students who<br />\nparticipated in that struggle understood and didn't object<br />\nwhen actions by a military-oriented Congress forced<br />\nHopkins to reinstate military recruiting, but everyone<br />\ninvolved, radicals and trustees alike, pointed to the bigger<br />\nproblem that caused the difficulty, the University's<br />\nincreasing financial dependence on government funds.<br />\nThus, in the soberest of terms, the Board and President<br />\nGordon ordered a study made of Hopkins' ties with the<br />\ngovernment. A step in the right direction, at least. But now<br />\nwe find out that even that small step is being ignored. A<br />\npresidential assistant apparently re-copied a few<br />\nNews-Letter articles and tried to pass it off as the<br />\nlarge-scale study, but even the Provost admitted that this<br />\nwould not do, adding that the current administration has<br />\nno plans for pursuing the idea. And so Hopkins will<br />\ncontinue to depend on the government for over half of its<br />\nbudget, and the next time a crisis arises, perhaps another<br />\nstudy will be commissioned. Even when students point out<br />\nproblems that are generally agreed to be issues worthy of<br />\nstudy, their efforts turn out to be in vain.<br /><br />\nSept. 21, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 6<br /><br />\nWalled Off<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIt is a shame that the<br />\nNews-Letter saw merit in the<br />\nOne View expressed by Warren<br />\nGulin.

This rapid<br />\ngrowth amply characterizes the satisfaction and<br />\nfulfillment derived from the practice of<br />\nTranscendental Meditation. Through the use of<br />\nthis method fifteen minutes twice a day<br />\nmeditators say greater happiness is infused into<br />\ntheir lives, and the energy given during this<br />\nprofound rest increases their efficiency in work,<br />\nstudies and produces a deep sense of inner<br />\nsecurity, well-being and peace of mind.<br />\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi, who has trained<br />\npeople to teach TM, says \"Transcendental<br />\nMeditation is a natural technique which allows<br />\nthe conscious mind to experience increasingly<br />\nmore subtle states of thought until the source of<br />\nthought, the unlimited reservoir of energy and<br />\ncreative intelligence, is reached. This simple<br />\npractice expands the capacity of the conscious<br />\nmind and a man is able to use his full potential in<br />\nall fields of thought and action.\" Believing man is<br />\nborn to fully appreciate life he has taught this<br />\ntechnique to utilize ones' full potential.<br />\nIt has been found that different states of<br />\nconsciousness are reflected through different<br />\nstates of the nervous system, the machinery we<br />\nuse to experience our life. Waking, dreaming and<br />\ndeep sleep-- the relative states of<br />\nconsciousness-- have their corresponding<br />\nphysiological states in the body, and there is, as<br />\nwell, a correspondingl phsyiological state when<br />\nmind transcends the level where the conscious<br />\nmind appreciates a thought to where the thought<br />\nbegins.
