The broad<br />\nvalues of education, however, which contribute to the enrichment<br />\nof the \"intellectual resources\" of all students is the more encompassing objective of education. At a time when the values of the<br />\nAmerican college and university systems are the subject of critical<br />\nscrutiny, the Hopkins has at the head of its administration not<br />\nonly a scientist who enhances the academic prestige of the University but an educator aware of the Hopkins relation to the<br />\nobjectives of enduring value to the undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nFRATERNITIES PLAY POP<br />\nTwo of the Hopkins fraternities played Santa Claus before<br />\nthe Christmas holiday for a group of local orphans.

After<br />\nthe partying the boys retired to the floor with their guests and<br />\nentertained them just like \"pop.\"<br />\nAs the fraternities extend their interest beyond the concern<br />\nfor exclusive rushing and big parties they provide a strong argument for the exponents of the campus groups. If the fraternity<br />\nsystem is to survive it will be the positive and not the negative acts<br />\nwhich determine its endurance.

It is not a<br />\nquestion of conquering people but<br />\nof agriculturally useful space.\"<br />\nFrom the beginning Hitler ha'd<br />\ninsisted that only an army could<br />\ngive him the necessary international prestige to obtain favorable<br />\nsettlements at the conference<br />\ntable. He was indisposed to admit<br />\nthat all the world was in the midst<br />\nof. depression, and he was unwilling to attempt a better solution<br />\nthan the printing of paper billions<br />\nand the investment of this money<br />\nIn the unproductive apparatus of<br />\nwar, which can produce only when<br />\nused to conquer the fruits of labor<br />\nof other peoples.<br />\nLife And Death<br />\nAustria and Czechoslovakia fell<br />\nto him.

We must<br />\nstrike or be destroyed sooner or<br />\nlater.\" On August 24, 1939, a week<br />\nbefore he invaded Poland, he was<br />\nlistening to Goering, their economic boss of Germany: \"We face<br />\ncertain bankruptcy within two<br />\nyears.\" Hitler stepped to the map,<br />\nfacing the felt-topped conference<br />\ntable at his secluded mountain<br />\nhide-out: \"Gentlemen, you have<br />\nheard the report of Reichminister<br />\nGoering.

The broad<br />\nvalues of education, however, which contribute to the enrichment<br />\nof the \"intellectual resources\" of all students is the more encompassing objective of education. At a time when the values of the<br />\nAmerican college and university systems are the subject of critical<br />\nscrutiny, the Hopkins has at the head of its administration not<br />\nonly a scientist who enhances the academic prestige of the University but an educator aware of the Hopkins relation to the<br />\nobjectives of enduring value to the undergraduates.<br /><br />\nFRATERNITIES PLAY POP<br />\nTwo of the Hopkins fraternities played Santa Claus before<br />\nthe Christmas holiday for a group of local orphans. The members<br />\nof the campus social groups entertained the youngsters with a<br />\nChristmas dinner and then presented them with presents. After<br />\nthe partying the boys retired to the floor with their guests and<br />\nentertained them just like \"pop.\"<br />\nAs the fraternities extend their interest beyond the concern<br />\nfor exclusive rushing and big parties they provide a strong argument for the exponents of the campus groups. If the fraternity<br />\nsystem is to survive it will be the positive and not the negative acts<br />\nwhich determine its endurance. The Hopkins fraternities that<br />\nplayed Santa Claus have established a worthy precedent.<br /><br />\nd!),<br /><br />\nPrestige By Army<br />\nBy 1937 Hitler was running<br />\nfrom his shadow.

It is not a<br />\nquestion of conquering people but<br />\nof agriculturally useful space.\"<br />\nFrom the beginning Hitler ha'd<br />\ninsisted that only an army could<br />\ngive him the necessary international prestige to obtain favorable<br />\nsettlements at the conference<br />\ntable. He was indisposed to admit<br />\nthat all the world was in the midst<br />\nof. depression, and he was unwilling to attempt a better solution<br />\nthan the printing of paper billions<br />\nand the investment of this money<br />\nIn the unproductive apparatus of<br />\nwar, which can produce only when<br />\nused to conquer the fruits of labor<br />\nof other peoples.<br />\nLife And Death<br />\nAustria and Czechoslovakia fell<br />\nto him.

We must<br />\nstrike or be destroyed sooner or<br />\nlater.\" On August 24, 1939, a week<br />\nbefore he invaded Poland, he was<br />\nlistening to Goering, their economic boss of Germany: \"We face<br />\ncertain bankruptcy within two<br />\nyears.\" Hitler stepped to the map,<br />\nfacing the felt-topped conference<br />\ntable at his secluded mountain<br />\nhide-out: \"Gentlemen, you have<br />\nheard the report of Reichminister<br />\nGoering.
