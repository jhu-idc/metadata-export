The document is good<br />\nbecause it presents ideas for the future of the University<br />\nthat are, at the least, provocative. Though he only halfheartedly defends the place of the undergraduate in the<br />\nUniversity, he does ask for extensive involvement by the<br />\nUniversity in the community.<br />\nBut, as we all hae noted so many times in the past<br />\nfour years, Gordon seems unable to express himself in a<br />\nclear, concise manner, instead cloudiing the issue with<br />\nhis own brand of diplomatic verbiage.<br />\nPerhaps the most significant passage in Gordon's<br />\nstatement is the one that confirms campus rumors<br />\nconcerning substantive action on the choice of an interim president. Apparently the Board of Trustees is<br />\nmaking this decision with typical Hopkins secrecy, as<br />\nBoard members continually refused comment on the<br />\nchoice. We urge that this matter be opened up immediately and that the University community be informed of the identity of the candidates for the interim<br />\npost. If such secrecy is continued throughout the<br />\nselection of the permanent president, it will spell<br />\ndisaster for the future of Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nArea Majors<br />\nOne of the problems facing the proponents of revision<br />\nin the undergraduate curriculum, as well as those<br />\npeople concerned with the governance question, is what<br />\nto do with area majors. The recent undergraduate<br />\nhearings committee report recommended abolishing<br />\nthe non-departmental majors. Though the move was illadvised, it did draw attention to the problems of the<br />\nacademic anonymity brought about by the refusal to<br />\nspecialize.<br />\nThis problem of intellectual isolation could be solved<br />\nby giving each area major its own \"department,\" a<br />\nrotating committee composed of professors from the<br />\nseparate areas. These committees would have departmental status within the university hierarchy. The five<br />\nnew \"departments\" would have two official duties-running the advising program for majors within their<br />\narea and drawing up the requirements for their majors<br />\nin consultation with the Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies and the Academic Council.<br />\nIt is clear that the area majors program should not be<br />\nabolished. Now, it is the only way for anyone but an<br />\naspiring professional academician to relate to this<br />\nresearch-oriented University. By giving each area<br />\nmajor its own department, the liberal arts-oriented<br />\nundergraduate would be able to enjoy the flexibility this<br />\nprogram embodies while having the personal contact<br />\nwith faculty members he now lacks. Though the<br />\nrelationship could never be as close as now exists between individual departments and their mejors, it would<br />\nbe another step towards making Hopkins a true community.<br />\nMoreover, this scheme would aid in solving the<br />\ngovernance question. Last summer's committee<br />\ngrappled with the role of the area major in a University<br />\nthat is run almost entirely by autonomous departments,<br />\nfinally and rather clumsily proposing that each major<br />\nattach himself to an individual department for governance questions. Unfortunately, this would result in<br />\nstudents who might have little invested in a department<br />\nvoting on matters solely of internal importance. By<br />\ngiving each area a department, it would be possible for<br />\nthe area majors to exercise governmental input at the<br />\nall-important department level, thus clearing the way<br />\nfor meaningful reforms of the governance system.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\n<br />\n\"I Hope They Just Mean Civilians\"<br />\n<br />\nSHUT UP AND DEAL<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn<br />\nresponse to<br />\nDr.<br />\nAthanasiou:<br />\nI cannot credit your<br />\nstatement that \"This idiotic<br />\nlaw (sodomy statute) affects<br />\nheterosexuals<br />\nand<br />\nhomosexuals equally.\" May I<br />\nask you when was the last<br />\ntime you or Mrs. Athanasiou<br />\nwere arrested in the public<br />\nstreet, barroom or bedroom<br />\nfor proposing if not consummating a variant upon<br />\nthe missionary position?

Perhaps, they felt<br />\nthat a new President was needed to guide<br />\nHopkins through a difficult period.<br />\nDr. Gordon's statement of resignation was<br />\nworded in very much the same way. In his<br />\nstatement he said that he was stepping aside<br />\nbecause he thought Hopkins could best be<br />\nserved by a younger, more energetic man. It<br />\nseems then that Hopkins -- in the long run -is to benefit from the sudden resignation of<br />\nits President.<br />\nIf Dr. Gordon did indeed resign for that<br />\nreason, then it becomes necessary for us to<br />\nattempt to determine why he was not in a<br />\nposition to provide the leadership many felt<br />\nwas needed from the President of this<br />\nUniversity. The most obvious reason for Dr.<br />\nGordon's failure to provide that leadership is<br />\ntwo-fold. First, Dr. Gordon did not seem to<br />\nhave the administrative talent or fund<br />\nraising ability necessary to adequately run<br />\nthe University. Second, for these and other<br />\nreasons, Dr. Gordon did not have the confidence of any segment of the University. He<br />\nwas a President without a power base. Due<br />\nto these and other insufficiencies it is inconceivable that Dr. Gordon could have held<br />\nhis office much longer.<br />\nImportant Qualifications<br />\nDr. Gordon, then, is out of office. The<br />\nUniversity is without a President, but<br />\nsomething has been learned from the demise<br />\nof President Gordon. We have learned that<br />\nthe President of this University, in order to.<br />\nbe more effective, must be a good administrator and must have the confidence of<br />\nevery major segment of the University<br />\ncommunity. If he lacks both or either of<br />\nthese qualifications, he cannot last.<br />\nThe lessons of Dr. Gordon's administration must not be lost to us. If they<br />\nare not to be lost, we must act upon them -- at<br />\nMartin Hickey is the. outgoing President of'the<br />\nStudent Association. Mar,k;Th?'-r7is a itoior.<br />\n<br />\nonce. One way to make these lessons felt is to<br />\nappoint a selection committee made up of<br />\nmembers of the Board of Trustees, faculty -junior and senior from all branches of the<br />\nUniversity -- students -- that means all fulltime degree students -- and employees.<br />\nAll of this group would be divided according to their campus and each of these<br />\nsegments would elect one representative -or some other appropriate number -- to serve<br />\non the committee. Students would be divided<br />\nalong the lines which presently exist, i.e.<br />\ngraduate, undergraduate, medical, etc.<br />\nEmployees would also be divided along<br />\nalready existing lines.<br />\nThree Objections<br />\nSeveral obvious objections can be raised to<br />\nthis proposal. For instance, it can be argued<br />\nthat the students, employees, and possibly<br />\nthe faculty have no knowledge of what to<br />\nlook for in a University President. The<br />\nsecond is that students are here only to<br />\nreceive an education and that, because they<br />\nare transients, they do not have a real interest in the welfare of the University. The<br />\nthird is a practical problem which deals with<br />\nhow the representatives of the various<br />\ngroups will be chosen.<br />\nLest us start with the third objection. The<br />\nprocess of choosing the representative of<br />\neach group should be determined by a<br />\ngeneral meeting of that segment of the<br />\nUniversity. That is to say that the Faculty<br />\nwould meet and decide how they should<br />\nchoose their representative, and so on.<br />\nThe second objection is not worth considering. It seems that the students' interest<br />\nin this institution has been sufficiently<br />\ndemonstrated in the past to make this objection invalid. However, if there are any<br />\ndoubters, we would remind them of<br />\ngovernance, military recruiting, Levering<br />\nHall, and many other issues of importance to<br />\nthis University, which the students have<br />\nbrought to the attention of the entire community.<br />\nAlso, unless the phrase \"a community of<br />\nscholars\" is merely idle chatter and unless<br />\nThe Blue Ribbon Committee's statement on<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br />\n<br />\n\fMarch 19, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nKyrie: Halcyon Days, Troubled Minds<br />\nDear Rik,<br />\nDo you remember me<br />\ntelling you about Charlie<br />\nTrueheart, a friend of mine<br />\nfrom first semester last<br />\nYear?

He<br />\nhad built an image of them to<br />\nhis friends and teachers, then<br />\nhis parents showed up. The<br />\nfeeling that their very appearance could break their<br />\nimage was excruciating. On<br />\n<br />\nthat last day he felt torn<br />\nbetween the desire to be the<br />\ndutiful son and be with his<br />\nparents or to go off and talk<br />\nwith your friends for what<br />\nseems to be the last time.<br />\nOver the summer, after the<br />\ncathartic end of the high<br />\nschool years, Charlie went to<br />\nParis. There all of the<br />\nquestions that he had forced<br />\ninto the background for so<br />\nlong came forward. He<br />\ncouldn't help but seriously<br />\nwonder what he really was, or<br />\nwhere he was going.<br />\nThat whole summer is<br />\npermeated<br />\nwith<br />\nlittle<br />\nthoughts about the beautiful<br />\ngirls, hogans and fantasies.<br />\nHe missed the girl back<br />\nhome, and her letters were<br />\njust as important as anything<br />\nthat you got from the girl<br />\nback home.<br />\nOf course, as a book of the<br />\n<br />\nnow adolescent, drugs are<br />\nincluded, but only as Charlie<br />\ncould do it. There are the<br />\nclever little pantomimes that<br />\nhe made into a ritual. Then<br />\nthere was the drug induced<br />\nclairvoyance where he<br />\nstretched the depths of his<br />\nrelationships with his friends.<br />\nI can easily remember<br />\nCharlie doing the same thing<br />\nin my dorm room last year.<br />\nThe best way to close I<br />\nguess would be to tell you of a<br />\nconversation I overheard<br />\nwhen I was at Amherst a few<br />\nweeks ago. Charlie was<br />\ncalling his publisher to see<br />\nhow the crucial reviews were<br />\ncoming along. It was long<br />\ndistance, and he casually<br />\nintroduced himself to the<br />\npublishing house operator.<br />\n\"I'm Charlie Trueheart, and I<br />\nwould like to speak to Mrs.<br />\nPratt.\" Then he said, \"I'm<br />\n<br />\nCharles Trueheart an author,<br />\nyou publish me.\" This must<br />\nhave worked because then he<br />\nwent into a discussion of his<br />\none review so far. Seventeen<br />\nmagazine had said, \"If you<br />\nare looking for action, don't<br />\nlook here.\"<br />\nWell that my be true for<br />\nSeventeen readers, who are<br />\nbusy finding out how they can<br />\ndecorate their rooms with the<br />\ngrooviest posters, but for me<br />\nat least KYRIE was good.

Glenn Beall, (RMd.) said yesterday that he<br />\nwill oppose the continuation<br />\nof the 2-S deferment.<br />\n\"I think that as long as the<br />\ndraft exists, it should be<br />\napplied equally to all those<br /><br />\nwho are in the affected age<br />\ngroup,\" he stated.<br />\n\"Student<br />\ndeferments<br />\ncreate a way for a select<br />\ngroup of individuals to<br />\npostpone or avoid compliance<br />\nwith this obligation.\"<br />\nVolunteers Proposed<br />\nRep. Parren Mitchell, 7th<br />\ndistrict, has introduced a bill<br />\nto end the Selective Service<br />\nSystem in favor of a volunteer<br />\narmy, which, according to his<br />\nLegislative Assistant Cliff<br />\nPugh, would end the need for<br />\nstudent deferments.<br />\n\"But we don't have much<br />\nhope of getting it through this<br />\nsession,\" Pugh admitted.<br />\nBoth Mitchell and 3rd<br />\ndistrict Rep. Paul Sarbanes<br />\nsupport the concept of a<br />\nvolunteer army. Sarbanes is<br />\none of 45 sponsors of a bill<br />\nwhich would implement most<br />\nof the recommendations of<br />\nthe Gates Commission, to<br />\nmake the armed services<br />\nmore attractive as a career.<br /><br />\nThat bill includes proposals<br />\nto raise pay and pensions, and<br />\nto improve living conditions<br />\nfor servicemen and their<br />\nfamilies, but would work<br />\nindependently of the Selective<br />\nService System.<br />\nNeither<br />\nnor<br />\nMitchell<br />\nSarbanes would comment on<br />\nhow they will vote on the<br />\nelimination<br />\nof<br />\nstudent<br />\ndeferments.<br />\nSen.

The document is good<br />\nbecause it presents ideas for the future of the University<br />\nthat are, at the least, provocative. Though he only halfheartedly defends the place of the undergraduate in the<br />\nUniversity, he does ask for extensive involvement by the<br />\nUniversity in the community.<br />\nBut, as we all hae noted so many times in the past<br />\nfour years, Gordon seems unable to express himself in a<br />\nclear, concise manner, instead cloudiing the issue with<br />\nhis own brand of diplomatic verbiage.<br />\nPerhaps the most significant passage in Gordon's<br />\nstatement is the one that confirms campus rumors<br />\nconcerning substantive action on the choice of an interim president. Apparently the Board of Trustees is<br />\nmaking this decision with typical Hopkins secrecy, as<br />\nBoard members continually refused comment on the<br />\nchoice. We urge that this matter be opened up immediately and that the University community be informed of the identity of the candidates for the interim<br />\npost. If such secrecy is continued throughout the<br />\nselection of the permanent president, it will spell<br />\ndisaster for the future of Hopkins.<br /><br />\nArea Majors<br />\nOne of the problems facing the proponents of revision<br />\nin the undergraduate curriculum, as well as those<br />\npeople concerned with the governance question, is what<br />\nto do with area majors. The recent undergraduate<br />\nhearings committee report recommended abolishing<br />\nthe non-departmental majors. Though the move was illadvised, it did draw attention to the problems of the<br />\nacademic anonymity brought about by the refusal to<br />\nspecialize.<br />\nThis problem of intellectual isolation could be solved<br />\nby giving each area major its own \"department,\" a<br />\nrotating committee composed of professors from the<br />\nseparate areas. These committees would have departmental status within the university hierarchy. The five<br />\nnew \"departments\" would have two official duties-running the advising program for majors within their<br />\narea and drawing up the requirements for their majors<br />\nin consultation with the Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies and the Academic Council.<br />\nIt is clear that the area majors program should not be<br />\nabolished. Now, it is the only way for anyone but an<br />\naspiring professional academician to relate to this<br />\nresearch-oriented University. By giving each area<br />\nmajor its own department, the liberal arts-oriented<br />\nundergraduate would be able to enjoy the flexibility this<br />\nprogram embodies while having the personal contact<br />\nwith faculty members he now lacks. Though the<br />\nrelationship could never be as close as now exists between individual departments and their mejors, it would<br />\nbe another step towards making Hopkins a true community.<br />\nMoreover, this scheme would aid in solving the<br />\ngovernance question. Last summer's committee<br />\ngrappled with the role of the area major in a University<br />\nthat is run almost entirely by autonomous departments,<br />\nfinally and rather clumsily proposing that each major<br />\nattach himself to an individual department for governance questions. Unfortunately, this would result in<br />\nstudents who might have little invested in a department<br />\nvoting on matters solely of internal importance. By<br />\ngiving each area a department, it would be possible for<br />\nthe area majors to exercise governmental input at the<br />\nall-important department level, thus clearing the way<br />\nfor meaningful reforms of the governance system.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br /><br />\n\"I Hope They Just Mean Civilians\"<br /><br />\nSHUT UP AND DEAL<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn<br />\nresponse to<br />\nDr.<br />\nAthanasiou:<br />\nI cannot credit your<br />\nstatement that \"This idiotic<br />\nlaw (sodomy statute) affects<br />\nheterosexuals<br />\nand<br />\nhomosexuals equally.\" May I<br />\nask you when was the last<br />\ntime you or Mrs. Athanasiou<br />\nwere arrested in the public<br />\nstreet, barroom or bedroom<br />\nfor proposing if not consummating a variant upon<br />\nthe missionary position?

Perhaps, they felt<br />\nthat a new President was needed to guide<br />\nHopkins through a difficult period.<br />\nDr. Gordon's statement of resignation was<br />\nworded in very much the same way. In his<br />\nstatement he said that he was stepping aside<br />\nbecause he thought Hopkins could best be<br />\nserved by a younger, more energetic man. It<br />\nseems then that Hopkins -- in the long run -is to benefit from the sudden resignation of<br />\nits President.<br />\nIf Dr. Gordon did indeed resign for that<br />\nreason, then it becomes necessary for us to<br />\nattempt to determine why he was not in a<br />\nposition to provide the leadership many felt<br />\nwas needed from the President of this<br />\nUniversity. The most obvious reason for Dr.<br />\nGordon's failure to provide that leadership is<br />\ntwo-fold. First, Dr. Gordon did not seem to<br />\nhave the administrative talent or fund<br />\nraising ability necessary to adequately run<br />\nthe University. Second, for these and other<br />\nreasons, Dr. Gordon did not have the confidence of any segment of the University. He<br />\nwas a President without a power base. Due<br />\nto these and other insufficiencies it is inconceivable that Dr. Gordon could have held<br />\nhis office much longer.<br />\nImportant Qualifications<br />\nDr. Gordon, then, is out of office. The<br />\nUniversity is without a President, but<br />\nsomething has been learned from the demise<br />\nof President Gordon. We have learned that<br />\nthe President of this University, in order to.<br />\nbe more effective, must be a good administrator and must have the confidence of<br />\nevery major segment of the University<br />\ncommunity. If he lacks both or either of<br />\nthese qualifications, he cannot last.<br />\nThe lessons of Dr. Gordon's administration must not be lost to us. If they<br />\nare not to be lost, we must act upon them -- at<br />\nMartin Hickey is the. outgoing President of'the<br />\nStudent Association. Mar,k;Th?'-r7is a itoior.<br /><br />\nonce. One way to make these lessons felt is to<br />\nappoint a selection committee made up of<br />\nmembers of the Board of Trustees, faculty -junior and senior from all branches of the<br />\nUniversity -- students -- that means all fulltime degree students -- and employees.<br />\nAll of this group would be divided according to their campus and each of these<br />\nsegments would elect one representative -or some other appropriate number -- to serve<br />\non the committee. Students would be divided<br />\nalong the lines which presently exist, i.e.<br />\ngraduate, undergraduate, medical, etc.<br />\nEmployees would also be divided along<br />\nalready existing lines.<br />\nThree Objections<br />\nSeveral obvious objections can be raised to<br />\nthis proposal. For instance, it can be argued<br />\nthat the students, employees, and possibly<br />\nthe faculty have no knowledge of what to<br />\nlook for in a University President. The<br />\nsecond is that students are here only to<br />\nreceive an education and that, because they<br />\nare transients, they do not have a real interest in the welfare of the University. The<br />\nthird is a practical problem which deals with<br />\nhow the representatives of the various<br />\ngroups will be chosen.<br />\nLest us start with the third objection. The<br />\nprocess of choosing the representative of<br />\neach group should be determined by a<br />\ngeneral meeting of that segment of the<br />\nUniversity. That is to say that the Faculty<br />\nwould meet and decide how they should<br />\nchoose their representative, and so on.<br />\nThe second objection is not worth considering. It seems that the students' interest<br />\nin this institution has been sufficiently<br />\ndemonstrated in the past to make this objection invalid. However, if there are any<br />\ndoubters, we would remind them of<br />\ngovernance, military recruiting, Levering<br />\nHall, and many other issues of importance to<br />\nthis University, which the students have<br />\nbrought to the attention of the entire community.<br />\nAlso, unless the phrase \"a community of<br />\nscholars\" is merely idle chatter and unless<br />\nThe Blue Ribbon Committee's statement on<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br /><br />\nMarch 19, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nKyrie: Halcyon Days, Troubled Minds<br />\nDear Rik,<br />\nDo you remember me<br />\ntelling you about Charlie<br />\nTrueheart, a friend of mine<br />\nfrom first semester last<br />\nYear?

He<br />\nhad built an image of them to<br />\nhis friends and teachers, then<br />\nhis parents showed up. The<br />\nfeeling that their very appearance could break their<br />\nimage was excruciating. On<br /><br />\nthat last day he felt torn<br />\nbetween the desire to be the<br />\ndutiful son and be with his<br />\nparents or to go off and talk<br />\nwith your friends for what<br />\nseems to be the last time.<br />\nOver the summer, after the<br />\ncathartic end of the high<br />\nschool years, Charlie went to<br />\nParis. There all of the<br />\nquestions that he had forced<br />\ninto the background for so<br />\nlong came forward. He<br />\ncouldn't help but seriously<br />\nwonder what he really was, or<br />\nwhere he was going.<br />\nThat whole summer is<br />\npermeated<br />\nwith<br />\nlittle<br />\nthoughts about the beautiful<br />\ngirls, hogans and fantasies.<br />\nHe missed the girl back<br />\nhome, and her letters were<br />\njust as important as anything<br />\nthat you got from the girl<br />\nback home.<br />\nOf course, as a book of the<br /><br />\nnow adolescent, drugs are<br />\nincluded, but only as Charlie<br />\ncould do it.

Charlie was<br />\ncalling his publisher to see<br />\nhow the crucial reviews were<br />\ncoming along. It was long<br />\ndistance, and he casually<br />\nintroduced himself to the<br />\npublishing house operator.<br />\n\"I'm Charlie Trueheart, and I<br />\nwould like to speak to Mrs.<br />\nPratt.\" Then he said, \"I'm<br /><br />\nCharles Trueheart an author,<br />\nyou publish me.\" This must<br />\nhave worked because then he<br />\nwent into a discussion of his<br />\none review so far.
