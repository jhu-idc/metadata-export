Back in the old<br />\ndays, when men wore high hats and<br />\nfrock coats, they had plenty of time to<br />\nthink things out, and they had sense, too.<br />\nThey used to sit down on a log and take<br />\nthe time to whittle their tobacco from a<br />\nplug, to be sure of having a cool smoke.<br />\n<br />\nWE<br />\n<br />\nIn those days,a man named Wellman,<br />\nright here in Quincy,Ill., made about the<br />\nbest tobacco you could get. He knew how<br />\nto keep the flavor fine and mellow.<br />\nWell, sir, the people who make this<br />\nGranger Rough Cut acquired Mr.<br />\nWellman's method, and they must have<br />\n\u2022known how the old boys used to whittle<br />\ntheir tobacco to make it smoke cool. Yes,<br />\nsir, this Granger is the real stuff. The<br />\nsame mellowness and fine flavor that<br />\nWellman used to hand out to his friends.<br />\nAnd it's whittled into big shaggy flakes<br />\nall ready for the pipe.'Rough Cut' they<br />\ncall it--ecut rough to smoke cool' is the<br />\nbest way I can describe it.<br />\n<br />\n0 1933<br />\nLIGGETT & MYERS<br />\nTOBACCO CO.<br />\n<br />\nTEN CENTS<br />\n<br />\nThe Granger pouch<br />\nkeeps the tobacco fresh<br />\n<br />\n\"Regardless of price, Granger is about<br />\nthe best pipe tobacco I ever smoked.That's<br />\nwhy I smoke it, and that's why they call<br />\nit America's Pipe Tobacco, sir.\"<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 I.<br />\n<br />\nGRANGER tobacco in a common-sense<br />\n<br />\nNow we wanted to sell Granger for 100.<br />\nIt was just a question of how to do it for<br />\nthe price.

Back in the old<br />\ndays, when men wore high hats and<br />\nfrock coats, they had plenty of time to<br />\nthink things out, and they had sense, too.<br />\nThey used to sit down on a log and take<br />\nthe time to whittle their tobacco from a<br />\nplug, to be sure of having a cool smoke.<br /><br />\nWE<br /><br />\nIn those days,a man named Wellman,<br />\nright here in Quincy,Ill., made about the<br />\nbest tobacco you could get. He knew how<br />\nto keep the flavor fine and mellow.<br />\nWell, sir, the people who make this<br />\nGranger Rough Cut acquired Mr.<br />\nWellman's method, and they must have<br />\n\u2022known how the old boys used to whittle<br />\ntheir tobacco to make it smoke cool. Yes,<br />\nsir, this Granger is the real stuff. The<br />\nsame mellowness and fine flavor that<br />\nWellman used to hand out to his friends.<br />\nAnd it's whittled into big shaggy flakes<br />\nall ready for the pipe.'Rough Cut' they<br />\ncall it--ecut rough to smoke cool' is the<br />\nbest way I can describe it.<br /><br />\n0 1933<br />\nLIGGETT &amp; MYERS<br />\nTOBACCO CO.<br /><br />\nTEN CENTS<br /><br />\nThe Granger pouch<br />\nkeeps the tobacco fresh<br /><br />\n\"Regardless of price, Granger is about<br />\nthe best pipe tobacco I ever smoked.That's<br />\nwhy I smoke it, and that's why they call<br />\nit America's Pipe Tobacco, sir.\"<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 I.<br /><br />\nGRANGER tobacco in a common-sense<br /><br />\nNow we wanted to sell Granger for 100.<br />\nIt was just a question of how to do it for<br />\nthe price. So we pack Granger in a sensible foil pouch instead of an expensive<br />\npackage, knowing that a man can't smoke<br />\nthe package. We give smokers this good<br /><br />\npouch for 100.<br />\nGRANGER has not been on sale very<br /><br />\nlong, but it has grown to be a popular<br />\nsmoke. And there is this much about it\u2014<br />\nwe have yet to know of a man who started<br />\nto smoke it, who didn't keep on.
