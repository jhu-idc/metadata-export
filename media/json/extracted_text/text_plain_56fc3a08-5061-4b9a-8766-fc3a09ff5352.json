In one experiment,<br />\nfive different groups of people,<br />\nstudents, mental patients,<br />\npsychologists and psychiatrists,<br />\nnurses, and business executives<br />\nwere selected to participate.<br />\nShaffer showed each subject<br />\nsixteen lines of uniform length,<br />\none at a t ime, through an<br />\naperture.

The beauty of our<br />\nintersession program is its<br />\nflexibility.

In spite of these qualms, most<br />\nmembers were hopeful that the Council<br />\nwould be an effective group this year.<br />\nRegular meetings, hard work on the part<br />\nof all individual members, and a decision<br />\nto consider meaningful issues were held<br />\nto be essential to a productive advisory<br />\ncouncil of this nature.<br />\nPleased<br />\nI was quite pleased yesterday morning<br />\nto receive notice that the first meeting of<br />\nthe ASAC (renamed the Homewood<br />\nAdvisory Council this year) will be held<br />\nthis coming Tuesday afternoon. The fact<br />\nthat the HAC will finally convene is a<br />\nstart in the right direction. However, the<br />\nmore serious questions regarding the<br />\nefi..:liveness of the HAC can not be<br />\nanswered quite so easily.<br />\nThere must be a commitment by all<br />\nmembers of the Homewood Advisory<br />\nCouncil the Chairman, and all faculty<br />\nand student representatives that the the<br />\nCouncil will function effectively in all of<br />\nits designated capacities.<br />\n<br />\nsupplied with all intimmation available<br />\nregarding specific matters which the HAG<br />\nwill seek to examine, or upon which the<br />\nadvice, of the HAC is sought. The HAC<br />\nshould be a source of information for all<br />\nthe members of the Homewood<br />\ncommu nity.

The print is somewhat<br />\nflawed, but the fundamental graphic<br />\nartistry is still quite impressive, even after<br />\ntwo decades of innovation in the field of<br />\ncartoon animation. The story is an<br />\ningenious one that might be spoiled by<br />\nmy synopsis, so I'll only say that the<br />\nmost important question of the century the place technology could take in our<br />\neveryday lives - is given provocative<br />\ndramatic treatment in slightly over six<br />\nminutes. Mel Blanc does a wide variety of<br />\nvoices with his characteristic virtuosity.<br />\nIt's aimed, of course, at an eight-year-old<br />\naudience.<br />\nThat reminds me. Playing along with<br />\nthis cartoon is something called \"Oh!<br />\nCalcutta!\", which is presumably a movie.<br />\n\"Oh! Calcutta!\" is 100 minutes of a<br />\nvideotaped stage production, which was<br />\npresumably a revue. This production is, I<br />\nbelieve, supposed to be funny; there is an<br />\naudience somewhere in this presumed<br />\nmovie, laughing hard at the things that go<br />\non. There were also three or four men in<br />\nthe C.1\\arl.es the.ater (out of the<br />\neAvases '\u2018\u2018\u2018 the<br />\nine uasic prennseu or un: ualcurial<br />\nits rLcotilitleticiations atic=iViCe Will De<br />\nis that sex itself is a barrel of yuks.

Send type written copy to<br />\nthemselves. The three or four laughers at<br />\nbox 1230, campus mail. Today's column<br />\nthe Charles were later seen in another<br />\nis by Honurd Majev, a senior and member<br />\npart<br />\nof the city, leaning, helpless with<br />\nof the HAC.<br />\nlaughter, against a street lamp as they<br />\n<br />\nIn its communications capacity: The<br />\nHAC should be a forum for<br />\nCommunications among all component<br />\nelements of the Homewood community<br />\nwhich are represented on theCouncil. The<br />\nflow of communications needs to be<br />\ntwo-way\u2014views of the administration<br />\nbeing transmitted to the HAC members,<br />\nand vice versa.<br />\nIn its deliberative capacity: The HAC<br />\nshould study matters which have<br />\nsignificant impact on the Homewood<br />\ncommunity. There must be a<br />\ncommitment by the administration to<br />\nseek the advice of the HAC on all such<br />\n!natters.<br />\nIn its advisory capacity: the<br />\nrecommendations of the HAC should be<br />\nweighed in a careful and responsible<br />\nmanner by the policy-makers for the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nThe Homewood Advisory Council has<br />\nthe potential to be .the most effective<br />\nbody of its kind on our campus. If it does<br />\nindeed establish itself as al ehicle for the<br />\nexpression of opinion, as a source of<br />\ninformation, and as a forum for the<br />\ndiscussion of issues of significant concern<br />\nto the Homewood community, then the<br />\nHAC will have overcome many of its past<br />\n<br />\n,watched two dogs screwing in a nearby<br />\nalley.<br />\nIf sex is so hilarious, imagine what a<br />\nhowler it would be to videotape 100<br />\nminutes of people eating. Indeed, so<br />\nsuccessful has this \"movie\" been (the fact<br />\nthat Kenneth Tynan, who first conceived<br />\nthis brilliant idea, has not been publically<br />\ndrawn and quartered is taken as<br />\nencouragement), that we may see a sequel<br />\nabout the digestive system. People<br />\nburping, people throwing up. The<br />\npossibilities are endless.<br />\nNot only is \"Oh! Calcutta!\" not funny,<br />\nbut it's sexist, too. Nearly every vignette<br />\nhas something to do with a woman<br />\nwanting to but pretending not to, as<br />\nopposed to a man who wants to and tries<br />\nto, leaving us with a general impression of<br />\nU niversal human horniness comically<br />\ncomplicated by woman's inhibition<br />\nand/or hypocrisy. But the so-called \"Sex<br />\nRevolution\" has, from the very<br />\nbeginning, done little more than allow<br />\nsexism to flaunt itself everywhere. \"Oh!<br />\nCalcutta!\" is just another depressing<br />\nillustration of this fact.<br />\nStage productions transferred to the<br />\nscreen are rarely successful as movies, and<br />\nthis is no exception. The actors mug and<br />\n\"tf theve weve v\u2018cN cameras taking<br />\n4vciek._<br />\ntills movie snow(' go ua-c-K to ms srao at<br />\nonce: the timing is thoughtless, every cut<br />\nis mismatched, and every attempt at<br />\nsomething imaginative is incredibly<br />\npretentious.<br />\nOnly once are we taken out of the<br />\ntheater. At some point towards the end,<br />\nafter several deadly vignettes, there is an<br />\ninterminable sequence of the entire cast,<br />\nnaked as jaybirds, writhing and cavorting<br />\n<br />\nThe stuffgood orchestras are just made for<br />\nBy MARK SCAN LAN<br />\nThe Lyric is an impressive theatre. Its<br />\nbrass railings and plush boxes recall the<br />\ndays in the first quarter of this century<br />\nwhen Baltimore was a city of cultural<br />\nvitality; when its theatre, opera and<br />\nsy mphony matched any on this<br />\ncontinent.<br />\nI came 45 minutes early to the Lyric<br />\nWednesday evening and watched it fill to<br />\nnear capacity with every manner of<br />\nBaltimorean. There were the aged urban<br />\naristocracy, who fit in well with the<br />\ntattered elegance of the hall, the opulent<br />\nsuburbanites, who would not be outdone,<br />\nand the long-haired young, who, like<br />\neveryone else showed a drowsy reluctance<br />\nfor such entertainments as the symphony,<br />\nand a doubt that any orchestra, especially<br />\nBaltimore's, could arouse them.<br />\nBut on the stage strode a man who, for<br />\nthe past four seasons has fought valiantly<br />\nto dispell such doubts. If there is one man<br />\nmost responsible for the survival of the<br />\nsymphony through its financial crisis last<br />\nwinter, it is Sergiu Comissiona, who<br />\nattacks cultural apathy with an innovative<br />\napproach to programming, as his program<br />\nof Wednesday evening proved.<br />\nMy reason for being there 45 minutes<br />\nearly was to catch a lecture<br />\ndemonstration given before the concert<br />\nby assistant conductor Murray Sidlin. His<br />\npresentation (to an unfortunately small<br />\ngroup) fondly recalled the lectures I used<br />\nto attend as a child given by Leonard<br />\nBernstein and The New York<br />\nPhilharmonic. Mr. Sidlin had all the<br />\nfacility and humor, if not the charisma,<br />\nof Bernstein, as he explained some of the<br />\nhistory and structure .of the music we<br />\nwere about to hear. I greatly approve of<br />\nthis experiment, such a preview can add a<br />\ngreat deal to appreciation, can give the<br />\nlistener something to latch on to,<br />\nespecially with the unfamiliar sounds of<br />\nmodern composers.<br />\nOne point Mr. Sidlin stressed was how.<br />\ninfrequently the concert's three pieces<br />\nhave been performed. Conductors shy<br />\naway from Bartok's Divertimento for<br />\nString Orchestra because of a reluctance<br />\nto separate the strings from the remainder<br />\nof the orchestra. When it is performed, it<br />\nis usually done in the style of a concerto<br />\ngrosso, with a select ensemble of soloists.<br />\n<br />\nMaestro Comissiona is unafraid of the<br />\nunusual. He decided to do it with all his'<br />\nstrings.<br />\nLike all Bartok's music it makes great<br />\ntechnical demands. It calls for such tonal<br />\ninventiveness that a group of strings can<br />\nsound like at-) entire orchestra; a violin<br />\nmust be able to sound trumpet-like, a<br />\ncello must imitate a bassoon. The<br />\norchestra stood up very well to this<br />\nrequirement. Handling the rhythmic and<br />\ndynamic demands of the work, however,<br />\nthey were less successful. Bartok drew<br />\nheavily on the folk music of Eastern<br />\nEurope, a tradition more familiar to<br />\nMaestro Comissiona,&Rumanian, than to<br />\nhis players. He tried a strorig and clipped<br />\nattack, puncing the air with his baton,<br />\nbut the violins were not brave enough to<br />\nlaunch into this unfamiliar territory with<br />\nconfidence. This was particularly<br />\napparent in the first movement which<br />\nalso calls for a volumetric range the<br />\nensemble simply could not provide.<br />\nThe performance improved in the<br />\n<br />\nsecond movement, which gave the violas<br />\nan opportunity to show their competence<br />\nwith tender lyrical passages. In the<br />\nsprightly and humorous third movement,<br />\nthe violins again lacked rhythmic<br />\nprecision, often too noticeably lagging<br />\nbehind the determined attack of<br />\nconcertmaster Isidor Saslav.<br />\nThe highlight of the evening was<br />\nBenjamin Britten's Diversions on a<br />\nTheme. Contemporary with the Bartok<br />\ncomposition, it, too, belies the difficulty<br />\nof the period in which it was composed.<br />\nDiversions is actually one of an unusual<br />\nspecies of piano concerto performed<br />\nentirely by the left hand. Britten wrote it<br />\nfor the Viennese pianist Paul<br />\n.Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm in<br />\nWorld War I. Wednesday evening it was<br />\nperformed by Leon Fleisher who also<br />\nperforms only with his left hand (the<br />\nwoman sitting next to me said it was due<br />\nto arthritis, but I was not able to verify<br />\nthis). A pianist restricted to such a small<br />\nrepertory, must have the opportunity to<br />\ndevelop a deeper understanding for each<br />\nwork he performs. With Britten's<br />\nDiversions, Mr. Fleisher displayed an<br />\nemotional understanding as great as his<br />\ntechnical control: one moment rendering<br />\na delicate background of perfect<br />\narpeggioes, at the next, jumping registers<br />\nwith stunningly forceful chords. It<br />\nsounded to me as if he were playing with<br />\nboth hands, but there always was his right<br />\nhand, sometimes lying relaxed on his<br />\nthigh, sometimes tightly gripping the side<br />\nof the keyboard as if struggling to confine<br />\nhis expressive energy to the piano.<br />\nMr. Fleisher's sensitivity made him<br />\never-conscious of his being part of the<br />\norchestra, whose sound had now vastly<br />\nimproved with the addition of<br />\nwoodwinds, brass and percussion. The<br />\ncomplement added the dynamic strength<br />\nmissing in the Bartok. Also contributing<br />\nto a better performance was the greater<br />\nfamiliarity of the Britten work, which the<br />\npounding jazz-like rhythms in the<br />\npercussion and brass that American<br />\norchestras understand best. After an<br />\nending of impressive crescendoes, Mr.<br />\nFleisher took seven bows to a now<br />\nenlivened audience, many of whom stood<br />\nand bravoed.<br />\nThe concert ended with a coup of<br />\n<br />\nprogramming genius. Maestro Comissiona<br />\nhad come from the alien strains of Bartok<br />\nto the comfortable familiarity of<br />\nTchaikowsky's Second Symphony in C<br />\nMinor. First attempted by the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony 30 years ago under the<br />\ndirection of Igor Stravinsky, it, too, is<br />\ninfrequently performed. Although the<br />\nmovements within themselves are<br />\ncompletely coherent, full of<br />\nTchaikowsky's genius for melody and<br />\nalternating motives, between the<br />\nmovements there is little thematic<br />\ninterrelationship, a fact which would<br />\nseem less of a drawback to our confused<br />\nage than it did one hundred years ago.<br />\nComissiona showed that it can, indeed, be<br />\na very popular piece.<br />\nThis is the stuff symphony orchestras<br />\nwere made for. Here is the opportunity<br />\nfor the conductor to grit his teeth and<br />\nshake his fists. The Maestro looks as a<br />\nsymphony conductor should, with<br />\nangular facial features and a bush of<br />\ntousled hair attached to a skeleton draped<br />\nin tails.<br />\nHe also moves as a symphony<br />\nconductor should: thrusting his baton<br />\nthrough a strong and brassy first<br />\nmovement, bouncing like a puppet with<br />\nhis arms at his sides for the second (a<br />\nlight-hearted march similar to the march<br />\nfrom The Nutcracker), pinching every<br />\ndelicate note from the scherzo third<br />\nmovement, and finishing the symphony<br />\nwith a fine piece of violence, with valiant<br />\nbaton flourishes high in the air, and full,<br />\ntwisting swipes to generate the volume<br />\nneeded for the typical Tchaikowsky<br />\nbombastic ending.<br />\nAnd a bombastic ending it was. One<br />\ncould plainly see the powerful effect<br />\nComissiona had made on his audience,<br />\nand the long-range effect he must have<br />\nwith continued successes. The Maestro<br />\nand his orchestra are doing their part to<br />\nmake Baltimore a place where fine music<br />\ncan thrive.<br />\n(The Baltimore has a special rates for<br />\nstudents, making it the best<br />\nentertainment bargain in the city: 16<br />\nWednesday or Thursday evening concerts<br />\nfor $20; 12 Saturday evening Pops<br />\nconcerts for $15 - from the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony Box Office, 120 Mt.

This<br />\nsequence is supposed to show us Sex in<br />\nall its essential loveliness, but it's all so<br />\ntechnically inept (if the production costs<br />\nexceeded $50, somebody was badly<br />\nripped off) that celibacy seems to be the<br />\nonly decent alternative. Imagine: after<br />\nfour or five boring sketches, we sit for<br />\nfifteen minutes and watch eight naked<br />\npinheads, all the color of decaying cream<br />\ncheese, climb all over each other in a<br />\nslime-green dell, giving each other various<br />\n<br />\nthrills and arty sidelong glances.<br />\nThe humor is so forced and the<br />\nsexiness so hollow that I'm sure the name<br />\n\"Kenneth Tynan\" is a front for some<br />\nsecret society of desperate eunuchs who<br />\nat this very moment are shivering fatly in<br />\nvicarious ecstasies. It's only pornography,<br />\nbut so far from being erotically rousing<br />\nthat one viewing is enough to make you<br />\nwant to donate your genitals to some<br />\nemerging nation, one still capable of using<br />\nthem without making a big deal out of it.<br />\nAnd aside from all this, \"Oh!

Bill Nolan and<br />\nHarry Stringer moved from<br />\ndefensive halfback to offensive<br />\nhalfback, and were replaced by<br />\nsophomores Rick Kramer and<br />\nJack Coulter. On the defensive<br />\nline, another sophomore, Ron<br />\nHall, started in place of injured<br />\nKuehn. The rest of the defense<br />\nremained intact.<br />\nBut it was the offensive line<br />\nwhich experienced the greatest<br />\n<br />\nshakeup. Jim Adams moved from<br />\nguard to tackle with freshman<br />\nJohn Nutting filling the guard<br />\nslot. Another freshman, Jim<br />\nDuffy, started at the other<br />\ntackle.<br />\nReplacing tight end<br />\nKowalchuk was junior Mike<br />\nBogdan, who had started the first<br />\nfive games of last season until<br />\npulled groin muscles sidelined<br />\nhim.

In one experiment,<br />\nfive different groups of people,<br />\nstudents, mental patients,<br />\npsychologists and psychiatrists,<br />\nnurses, and business executives<br />\nwere selected to participate.<br />\nShaffer showed each subject<br />\nsixteen lines of uniform length,<br />\none at a t ime, through an<br />\naperture.

It aids the development<br />\nof programs and courses that<br />\nWould differ from or supplement<br />\nthe types of offerings normally<br />\ngiven in the Spring or Fall.\"<br />\n\u2022 Suskind \u2022 stressed the flexible<br /><br />\nnature of Hopkins' intersession<br />\nprogram, contrasting it with<br />\nthose of other institutions.<br />\n\"Other schools which have<br />\nJanuary terms require<br />\nparticipation. The beauty of our<br />\nintersession program is its<br />\nflexibility. Those who participate<br />\nare involved and enjoy it,\"<br />\nSuskind said.<br />\nAs Is<br />\nDr. Mary Ainsworth,<br />\nPsychology, head of the<br />\nsub-committee which prepared<br />\nthe intersession study, also<br />\nemphasized the voluntary nature<br />\nof the January term, \"The<br />\nCommittee came up with a<br />\nreport favorable to continuation<br />\nof intersession as is. The program<br />\nwill remain totally voluntary.\"<br />\nThe sub-committee report,<br />\nnow awaiting modification and<br />\nacceptance by the Academic<br />\nCouncil, entails nine<br /><br />\nrecommendations dealing with<br />\nspecific parts of the intersession<br />\nprogram.<br />\nMuch of the input into the<br />\nsub-committee report came from<br />\ntwo questionaires, one to faculty<br />\nand one to students, distributed<br />\nlast semester. Suskind estimated<br />\nacceptance of the report would<br />\ntake place in approximately two<br />\nweeks.<br /><br />\nPeterson's<br />\nCandy &amp; Ice Cream<br />\nShoppe<br /><br />\nsaid,.\"Here is a short one and<br />\nnow a longer one.\" Many<br />\nsubjects recorded the lines as<br />\nshorter or longer in response to<br />\nthe sentence that preceeded the<br />\nline.

In spite of these qualms, most<br />\nmembers were hopeful that the Council<br />\nwould be an effective group this year.<br />\nRegular meetings, hard work on the part<br />\nof all individual members, and a decision<br />\nto consider meaningful issues were held<br />\nto be essential to a productive advisory<br />\ncouncil of this nature.<br />\nPleased<br />\nI was quite pleased yesterday morning<br />\nto receive notice that the first meeting of<br />\nthe ASAC (renamed the Homewood<br />\nAdvisory Council this year) will be held<br />\nthis coming Tuesday afternoon. The fact<br />\nthat the HAC will finally convene is a<br />\nstart in the right direction. However, the<br />\nmore serious questions regarding the<br />\nefi..:liveness of the HAC can not be<br />\nanswered quite so easily.<br />\nThere must be a commitment by all<br />\nmembers of the Homewood Advisory<br />\nCouncil the Chairman, and all faculty<br />\nand student representatives that the the<br />\nCouncil will function effectively in all of<br />\nits designated capacities.<br /><br />\nsupplied with all intimmation available<br />\nregarding specific matters which the HAG<br />\nwill seek to examine, or upon which the<br />\nadvice, of the HAC is sought. The HAC<br />\nshould be a source of information for all<br />\nthe members of the Homewood<br />\ncommu nity.

The print is somewhat<br />\nflawed, but the fundamental graphic<br />\nartistry is still quite impressive, even after<br />\ntwo decades of innovation in the field of<br />\ncartoon animation. The story is an<br />\ningenious one that might be spoiled by<br />\nmy synopsis, so I'll only say that the<br />\nmost important question of the century the place technology could take in our<br />\neveryday lives - is given provocative<br />\ndramatic treatment in slightly over six<br />\nminutes. Mel Blanc does a wide variety of<br />\nvoices with his characteristic virtuosity.<br />\nIt's aimed, of course, at an eight-year-old<br />\naudience.<br />\nThat reminds me. Playing along with<br />\nthis cartoon is something called \"Oh!<br />\nCalcutta!\", which is presumably a movie.<br />\n\"Oh! Calcutta!\" is 100 minutes of a<br />\nvideotaped stage production, which was<br />\npresumably a revue. This production is, I<br />\nbelieve, supposed to be funny; there is an<br />\naudience somewhere in this presumed<br />\nmovie, laughing hard at the things that go<br />\non. There were also three or four men in<br />\nthe C.1\\arl.es the.ater (out of the<br />\neAvases '\u2018\u2018\u2018 the<br />\nine uasic prennseu or un: ualcurial<br />\nits rLcotilitleticiations atic=iViCe Will De<br />\nis that sex itself is a barrel of yuks.

There must be a<br />\ncommitment by the administration to<br />\nseek the advice of the HAC on all such<br />\n!natters.<br />\nIn its advisory capacity: the<br />\nrecommendations of the HAC should be<br />\nweighed in a careful and responsible<br />\nmanner by the policy-makers for the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nThe Homewood Advisory Council has<br />\nthe potential to be .the most effective<br />\nbody of its kind on our campus. If it does<br />\nindeed establish itself as al ehicle for the<br />\nexpression of opinion, as a source of<br />\ninformation, and as a forum for the<br />\ndiscussion of issues of significant concern<br />\nto the Homewood community, then the<br />\nHAC will have overcome many of its past<br /><br />\n,watched two dogs screwing in a nearby<br />\nalley.<br />\nIf sex is so hilarious, imagine what a<br />\nhowler it would be to videotape 100<br />\nminutes of people eating. Indeed, so<br />\nsuccessful has this \"movie\" been (the fact<br />\nthat Kenneth Tynan, who first conceived<br />\nthis brilliant idea, has not been publically<br />\ndrawn and quartered is taken as<br />\nencouragement), that we may see a sequel<br />\nabout the digestive system. People<br />\nburping, people throwing up. The<br />\npossibilities are endless.<br />\nNot only is \"Oh! Calcutta!\" not funny,<br />\nbut it's sexist, too. Nearly every vignette<br />\nhas something to do with a woman<br />\nwanting to but pretending not to, as<br />\nopposed to a man who wants to and tries<br />\nto, leaving us with a general impression of<br />\nU niversal human horniness comically<br />\ncomplicated by woman's inhibition<br />\nand/or hypocrisy. But the so-called \"Sex<br />\nRevolution\" has, from the very<br />\nbeginning, done little more than allow<br />\nsexism to flaunt itself everywhere. \"Oh!<br />\nCalcutta!\" is just another depressing<br />\nillustration of this fact.<br />\nStage productions transferred to the<br />\nscreen are rarely successful as movies, and<br />\nthis is no exception.

Its<br />\nbrass railings and plush boxes recall the<br />\ndays in the first quarter of this century<br />\nwhen Baltimore was a city of cultural<br />\nvitality; when its theatre, opera and<br />\nsy mphony matched any on this<br />\ncontinent.<br />\nI came 45 minutes early to the Lyric<br />\nWednesday evening and watched it fill to<br />\nnear capacity with every manner of<br />\nBaltimorean. There were the aged urban<br />\naristocracy, who fit in well with the<br />\ntattered elegance of the hall, the opulent<br />\nsuburbanites, who would not be outdone,<br />\nand the long-haired young, who, like<br />\neveryone else showed a drowsy reluctance<br />\nfor such entertainments as the symphony,<br />\nand a doubt that any orchestra, especially<br />\nBaltimore's, could arouse them.<br />\nBut on the stage strode a man who, for<br />\nthe past four seasons has fought valiantly<br />\nto dispell such doubts. If there is one man<br />\nmost responsible for the survival of the<br />\nsymphony through its financial crisis last<br />\nwinter, it is Sergiu Comissiona, who<br />\nattacks cultural apathy with an innovative<br />\napproach to programming, as his program<br />\nof Wednesday evening proved.<br />\nMy reason for being there 45 minutes<br />\nearly was to catch a lecture<br />\ndemonstration given before the concert<br />\nby assistant conductor Murray Sidlin. His<br />\npresentation (to an unfortunately small<br />\ngroup) fondly recalled the lectures I used<br />\nto attend as a child given by Leonard<br />\nBernstein and The New York<br />\nPhilharmonic. Mr. Sidlin had all the<br />\nfacility and humor, if not the charisma,<br />\nof Bernstein, as he explained some of the<br />\nhistory and structure .of the music we<br />\nwere about to hear. I greatly approve of<br />\nthis experiment, such a preview can add a<br />\ngreat deal to appreciation, can give the<br />\nlistener something to latch on to,<br />\nespecially with the unfamiliar sounds of<br />\nmodern composers.<br />\nOne point Mr. Sidlin stressed was how.<br />\ninfrequently the concert's three pieces<br />\nhave been performed. Conductors shy<br />\naway from Bartok's Divertimento for<br />\nString Orchestra because of a reluctance<br />\nto separate the strings from the remainder<br />\nof the orchestra. When it is performed, it<br />\nis usually done in the style of a concerto<br />\ngrosso, with a select ensemble of soloists.<br /><br />\nMaestro Comissiona is unafraid of the<br />\nunusual. He decided to do it with all his'<br />\nstrings.<br />\nLike all Bartok's music it makes great<br />\ntechnical demands. It calls for such tonal<br />\ninventiveness that a group of strings can<br />\nsound like at-) entire orchestra; a violin<br />\nmust be able to sound trumpet-like, a<br />\ncello must imitate a bassoon. The<br />\norchestra stood up very well to this<br />\nrequirement. Handling the rhythmic and<br />\ndynamic demands of the work, however,<br />\nthey were less successful. Bartok drew<br />\nheavily on the folk music of Eastern<br />\nEurope, a tradition more familiar to<br />\nMaestro Comissiona,&amp;Rumanian, than to<br />\nhis players. He tried a strorig and clipped<br />\nattack, puncing the air with his baton,<br />\nbut the violins were not brave enough to<br />\nlaunch into this unfamiliar territory with<br />\nconfidence. This was particularly<br />\napparent in the first movement which<br />\nalso calls for a volumetric range the<br />\nensemble simply could not provide.<br />\nThe performance improved in the<br /><br />\nsecond movement, which gave the violas<br />\nan opportunity to show their competence<br />\nwith tender lyrical passages. In the<br />\nsprightly and humorous third movement,<br />\nthe violins again lacked rhythmic<br />\nprecision, often too noticeably lagging<br />\nbehind the determined attack of<br />\nconcertmaster Isidor Saslav.<br />\nThe highlight of the evening was<br />\nBenjamin Britten's Diversions on a<br />\nTheme. Contemporary with the Bartok<br />\ncomposition, it, too, belies the difficulty<br />\nof the period in which it was composed.<br />\nDiversions is actually one of an unusual<br />\nspecies of piano concerto performed<br />\nentirely by the left hand. Britten wrote it<br />\nfor the Viennese pianist Paul<br />\n.Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm in<br />\nWorld War I. Wednesday evening it was<br />\nperformed by Leon Fleisher who also<br />\nperforms only with his left hand (the<br />\nwoman sitting next to me said it was due<br />\nto arthritis, but I was not able to verify<br />\nthis). A pianist restricted to such a small<br />\nrepertory, must have the opportunity to<br />\ndevelop a deeper understanding for each<br />\nwork he performs. With Britten's<br />\nDiversions, Mr. Fleisher displayed an<br />\nemotional understanding as great as his<br />\ntechnical control: one moment rendering<br />\na delicate background of perfect<br />\narpeggioes, at the next, jumping registers<br />\nwith stunningly forceful chords. It<br />\nsounded to me as if he were playing with<br />\nboth hands, but there always was his right<br />\nhand, sometimes lying relaxed on his<br />\nthigh, sometimes tightly gripping the side<br />\nof the keyboard as if struggling to confine<br />\nhis expressive energy to the piano.<br />\nMr. Fleisher's sensitivity made him<br />\never-conscious of his being part of the<br />\norchestra, whose sound had now vastly<br />\nimproved with the addition of<br />\nwoodwinds, brass and percussion. The<br />\ncomplement added the dynamic strength<br />\nmissing in the Bartok. Also contributing<br />\nto a better performance was the greater<br />\nfamiliarity of the Britten work, which the<br />\npounding jazz-like rhythms in the<br />\npercussion and brass that American<br />\norchestras understand best. After an<br />\nending of impressive crescendoes, Mr.<br />\nFleisher took seven bows to a now<br />\nenlivened audience, many of whom stood<br />\nand bravoed.<br />\nThe concert ended with a coup of<br /><br />\nprogramming genius. Maestro Comissiona<br />\nhad come from the alien strains of Bartok<br />\nto the comfortable familiarity of<br />\nTchaikowsky's Second Symphony in C<br />\nMinor. First attempted by the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony 30 years ago under the<br />\ndirection of Igor Stravinsky, it, too, is<br />\ninfrequently performed. Although the<br />\nmovements within themselves are<br />\ncompletely coherent, full of<br />\nTchaikowsky's genius for melody and<br />\nalternating motives, between the<br />\nmovements there is little thematic<br />\ninterrelationship, a fact which would<br />\nseem less of a drawback to our confused<br />\nage than it did one hundred years ago.<br />\nComissiona showed that it can, indeed, be<br />\na very popular piece.<br />\nThis is the stuff symphony orchestras<br />\nwere made for. Here is the opportunity<br />\nfor the conductor to grit his teeth and<br />\nshake his fists. The Maestro looks as a<br />\nsymphony conductor should, with<br />\nangular facial features and a bush of<br />\ntousled hair attached to a skeleton draped<br />\nin tails.<br />\nHe also moves as a symphony<br />\nconductor should: thrusting his baton<br />\nthrough a strong and brassy first<br />\nmovement, bouncing like a puppet with<br />\nhis arms at his sides for the second (a<br />\nlight-hearted march similar to the march<br />\nfrom The Nutcracker), pinching every<br />\ndelicate note from the scherzo third<br />\nmovement, and finishing the symphony<br />\nwith a fine piece of violence, with valiant<br />\nbaton flourishes high in the air, and full,<br />\ntwisting swipes to generate the volume<br />\nneeded for the typical Tchaikowsky<br />\nbombastic ending.<br />\nAnd a bombastic ending it was. One<br />\ncould plainly see the powerful effect<br />\nComissiona had made on his audience,<br />\nand the long-range effect he must have<br />\nwith continued successes. The Maestro<br />\nand his orchestra are doing their part to<br />\nmake Baltimore a place where fine music<br />\ncan thrive.<br />\n(The Baltimore has a special rates for<br />\nstudents, making it the best<br />\nentertainment bargain in the city: 16<br />\nWednesday or Thursday evening concerts<br />\nfor $20; 12 Saturday evening Pops<br />\nconcerts for $15 - from the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony Box Office, 120 Mt.

Bill Nolan and<br />\nHarry Stringer moved from<br />\ndefensive halfback to offensive<br />\nhalfback, and were replaced by<br />\nsophomores Rick Kramer and<br />\nJack Coulter. On the defensive<br />\nline, another sophomore, Ron<br />\nHall, started in place of injured<br />\nKuehn. The rest of the defense<br />\nremained intact.<br />\nBut it was the offensive line<br />\nwhich experienced the greatest<br /><br />\nshakeup. Jim Adams moved from<br />\nguard to tackle with freshman<br />\nJohn Nutting filling the guard<br />\nslot. Another freshman, Jim<br />\nDuffy, started at the other<br />\ntackle.<br />\nReplacing tight end<br />\nKowalchuk was junior Mike<br />\nBogdan, who had started the first<br />\nfive games of last season until<br />\npulled groin muscles sidelined<br />\nhim.

Unfortunately, the task<br />\nis far easier said than<br />\ndone.<br />\nLoyola currently has a run of 23<br />\nconsecutive victories pending the<br />\noutcome of a midweek match<br />\nagainst Towson State. The streak,<br />\npatterned from a 16-0 record last<br />\nseason and seven more wins this<br />\nyear, is one of the longest by any<br />\nschool in any sport in the<br />\ncountry. \u2022<br />\nWhile the Greyhounds must be<br />\nconsidered an overwhelming<br />\nfavorite, the Blue Jays have some<br />\nhistorical precedent on their side.<br />\nThree years ago, our Charles<br />\nStreet neighbors brought an<br />\nincredible 41 game winning<br />\nstreak to Homewood and were<br />\nbeaten, 1-0.

A<br />\nlarge,<br />\npartisan crowd, the home<br />\nfield<br />\nadvantage and the<br />\ncross-town rivalry between<br />\nschools might give<br />\nTowson State<br />\nenough incentive<br />\nto pull an<br />\nUpset.<br /><br />\nthey are still a marvelously<br />\ntalented squad.

Two linebackers, Carl<br />\nPerkins and Gordie Combs, are<br />\nsolid football players. They<br />\npossess the size and ability to<br />\ncause problems for the Blue Jay<br />\noffense. Their defensive unit is a<br />\nlot like Georgetown's. They are<br />\nbig and strong, but don't stunt<br />\nvery much.<br />\nOn offense they run the<br />\nwishbone. Their quarterback runs<br />\nthe option well and they have a<br />\nfine halfback who is fast and an<br />\noutside treat. Their tight end is a<br />\nsure-handed receiver and is<br />\nrelated to the Baltimore Colts'<br />\nnew head coach, John Sandusky.<br />\nLook Up<br />\nThings are again starting to<br />\nlook up for the Jays. Timmy<br />\nDoyle might be well enough to<br />\nplay after his long layoff.<br />\nHowever, he must win his job<br />\nback from Harry Stringer. Unless<br />\nTimmy proves he has regained his<br />\nearly season form, Harry deserves<br />\nanother start after his<br />\noutstanding game against<br />\nGeorgetown.<br />\nJack Thomas is also coming<br />\noff of an outstanding game. Jack<br />\nclicked on eleven of twenty-one<br />\npasses for 152 yards.
