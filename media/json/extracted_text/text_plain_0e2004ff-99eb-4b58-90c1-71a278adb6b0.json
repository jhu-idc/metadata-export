The council believes that it is unfair to<br />\ncharge the normal McCoy rent<br />\nto the 35 freshmen who were<br />\nforced to live in the upperclassmen apartment building<br />\nbecause of lack of space in the<br />\nfreshman dormitories. The normal rent for McCoy apartments<br />\nis $145 more per year than the<br />\nrent for a double room in the<br />\ndormitories.<br />\nThe Student Council Housing Committee, under the<br />\nleadership of Chairman Mike<br />\nKun and member Steve Sugretto, has been investigating the<br />\nissue since late last semester,<br />\nand Kun and Sugretto brought<br />\n<br />\nBettye Miller<br />\n<br />\nthe matter before the entire<br />\ncouncil Wednesday night. The<br />\ncouncil unanimously passed a<br />\nresolution urging the University to refund the $145 difference. Additionally, the<br />\nresolution calls upon the administration to establish a<br />\npolicy for the future \"whereby<br />\neither freshmen forced to live<br />\noff-campus would pay no more<br />\n<br />\nthan those on-campus or freshmen 'would be given the option<br />\nof living in off-campus buildings<br />\nin the event that an overrun<br />\nsituation did occur.\"<br />\nKun said he believes charging<br />\nthe freshmen the McCoy rate is<br />\nunfair because the students did<br />\nnot choose to be placed in<br />\nMcCoy, and because they are<br />\npaying for cooking facilities<br />\nthat they do not use.

Those students<br />\nwho qualify would be expected<br />\nto draw first on federal work<br />\nstudy and loan programs, allowing them to receive grants<br />\nonly if other sources of aid proved insufficient.<br />\nThe present federal financial<br />\naid system considers the Pell<br />\nGrant as the basic source of<br />\naid, with work study and loans<br />\nas supplements. So, in effect,<br />\nthe Reagan proposal is a reversal of the present priorities for<br />\nallocating funds.<br />\nThe adoption of Reagan's<br />\npolicies would result in the<br />\n<br />\nreduction of the number of<br />\ngrant programs from three to<br />\none, and generally increase<br />\ngrants to low income students<br />\nwhile reducing or denying<br />\ngrants to most middle income<br />\nstudents.<br />\nSuch a shift in aid from middle- to lower-class families<br />\nwould especially hurt a school<br />\nsuch as Hopkins, where the majority of students on financial<br />\naid are from middle-class<br />\nfamilies.<br />\nSpecifically, the administration proposes to eliminate<br />\naltogether the State Student Incentive Grants and the Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants. The remaining<br />\nfederal grant program, the Pell<br />\nGrant, would be renamed a<br />\n\"self-help\" grant and resealed.<br />\nCurrently the maximum that a<br />\nstudent can receive from a Pell<br />\nGrant is $1800. This limit<br />\nwould be increased to $3000.<br />\nSince these new grants would be<br />\ngiven to students from families<br />\nearning a maximum of $20,000.<br />\nthe general effect of the program would be to give poorer<br />\nstudents larger grants than they<br />\nwould have received under the<br />\nPell Grant program. The program would also greatly reduce<br />\nthe number of grants to students from middle-income<br />\nfamilies<br />\nChanges in the student loan<br />\nprogram are h. tg proposed as<br />\ncont, on p. 6<br />\n<br />\nder Factory, where he gained<br />\nexperience in the field of<br />\nexplosives.<br />\nIn April 1943, the government approached Koski and<br />\nasked him to help design explosive envelope of the atomic<br />\nbomb.

There are another 160 to<br />\n170 foreign graduate students,<br />\nplus 60 to 70 foreign faculty<br />\nand post-doctorates. This<br />\nnumber has been steadily increasing, according to Dianne<br />\nRichey, director of the Office<br />\nof Foreign Student and Faculty Services. Open Doors:<br />\n1980/81, a publicatio.: of the<br />\nInstitute of International<br />\nEducation, recorded 161<br />\nforeign students at Hopkins<br />\nduring the 1979-80 academic<br />\nyear and 181 in 1980-81.<br />\nForeign students decide to attend Hopkins for a variety of<br />\nreasons, many of them no different from those of the averge<br />\nAmerican student. The most<br />\nprevalent reason comes from<br />\nthe academic standpoint: \"The<br />\neducation is tops,\" says Karina<br />\nRobinson, a freshman from<br />\nSpain. Thanasis Simos, a sophomore, agrees: \"The quality of<br />\neducation is much better here<br />\nthan it is in Greece.\" Junior<br />\nTerrence Yau never even considered going to college in his<br />\nnative Hong Kong. He attributes this to the lack of a good<br />\n<br />\npre-medical program at both<br />\nmajor universities in that<br />\ncountry.<br />\nHopkins seems to draw<br />\nforeign undergraduates with<br />\nsome American background.<br />\nRobinson went to a British<br />\nschool in Madrid, and later to<br />\na boarding school in the U.S.,<br />\nso she knew how the American<br />\neducational system worked.<br />\nSimos' high school in Greece<br />\nhad an American administration.

The News-Letter's biggest problem is that too many Hopkins<br />\nstudents do not know how to write well. Yet<br />\nthe News-Letter is forced to draw its writers<br />\nfrom this pool of illiterates. Because there<br />\nare only'a limited number of good writers<br />\nat JHU, the problem becomes quite severe<br />\nwhen it is necessary for someone to have<br />\ncompetent writing skills as well as expertise<br />\nabout a particular subject matter. Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nundergraduates, however, do not deserve full ,<br />\nblame for this unfortunate situation. The<br />\nUniversity should shoulder the responsibility<br />\nof ensuring that all students graduate from<br />\nthis institution with the ability to write well,<br />\nnot for the News-Letter's sake, but as an end<br />\nin itself. In order to accomplish this, it would<br />\nrequire major changes in the curriculum and:<br />\nthe academic requirements of undergraduates. Although there is some talk of making curriculum changes in this direction, such<br />\nplans are long range and it will likely be<br />\nmany years before they are implemented.<br />\n<br />\nA Journalism Workshop At Hopkins<br />\nIn an effort to fill the void of journalistic undergraduates who work on campus pubinstruction, at MU, the News-Letter has lications.

Presently,<br />\nhowever, there is no professor capable of<br />\nteaching such a course. This is not an insurmountable obstacle. Instead of hiring a fulltime faculty member to teach journalism, the<br />\n<br />\ndepartment could conceivably hire an adjunct professor; someone who would merely instruct one class per semester.

The University maintains it may be losing a number<br />\nof top-notch students because<br />\nof its failure to compete with<br />\nattractive merit-based awards<br />\noffered at other competitive<br />\nschools.<br />\nIn response to these concerns, the Undergraduate Financial Aid 2000 committee,<br />\ncomposed of administrators,<br />\nfaculty, students and financial<br />\naid officers, is investigating the<br />\npossibility of initiating new<br />\nmerit-based \u2022rograms at Ho\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe Spring Ball<br />\nJointly Sponsored By:<br />\n<br />\nR.O.T.C.

Although<br />\nHopkins sponsors one such<br />\nscholarship, the beneficial Hodson, the committee has found<br />\n<br />\nthat it alone does not compete<br />\nwith other schools' more extensive programs. Colleges such as<br />\nUnion (NY), Emolry(GA), and<br />\nthe University of North Carolina entice prospective students<br />\nwith four-year full-tuition<br />\nscholarships, internships and<br />\npaid living expenses.

Cyrrently at Hopkins,<br />\nstudents receive only $260,000<br />\nin Pell Grants, while they<br />\nreceive $700,000 from SEOG<br />\nand SSIG programs. Further,<br />\nthe lowering of the income ceiling to $20,000 would greatly affect Hopkins students because<br />\nthe average family income of a<br />\nstudent receiving aid is $35,000.<br />\n<br />\nFinancial Aid Director Susan<br />\nBroadbent foresees a serious<br />\nproblem if the new proposals<br />\nare accepted. She is \"very concerned\" with \"this significant<br />\nloss in federal funding\" and is<br />\nnot certain as to where she will<br />\nfind funds to compensate for<br />\nsuch a loss. Further, she does<br />\nnot feel that the expansion of<br />\nthe current work-study program will be helpful to Hopkins<br />\nstudents because \"they are<br />\nalready working very hard.\"<br />\nBroadbent emphasizes the<br />\nfact that these proposed changes will not take effect until the<br />\n1-984-85 academic year because<br />\nof forward funding.<br />\nShe also stresses that these<br />\nare just proposals and therefore<br />\nthe specific effect on students<br />\ncan not be measured until the<br />\ndetails are known.<br />\nMoreover, the proposals are<br />\nsubject to the approval of Congress.

The co-captains<br />\nnot only had very good seasons,<br />\nbut they also provided an example of leadership for their teammates to follow.<br />\nWagstaff, a 142-pound senior from Rockville, Maryland,<br />\nserved his final year of eligibility this season, and left on a very<br />\npositive note, compiling a record of 16 wins and seven<br />\nlosses. \"Chester finally came<br />\naround this year and hammered<br />\nsome guys,\" said Eichler.'He<br />\nhad his best year ever.\"<br />\n' Before coming to Hopkins,<br />\nWagstaff wrestled at Bullis<br />\nHigh School in Potomac, Maryland, where he lettered two<br />\nyears and placed in his conference tournament as a senior.<br />\nAfter making the Hopkins<br />\nwrestling team as a freshman<br />\nwalk-on, Wagstaff proceeded<br />\nto letter all four years of his<br />\nHopkins career, and captained<br />\nthe team his final two years.<br />\nWhen not wrestling, Wagstaff is a Materials Science and<br />\nEngineering major, and plans<br />\nto eventually attend either<br />\nbusiness or graduate school. He<br />\nis also a member of Tau Epsilon Phi, and has pole-vaulted<br />\nfor the track team.<br />\nDespite his glittering record,<br />\nWagstaff wasisomewhat disappointed in his season. \"I think<br />\nI wrestled pretty poorly,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"I could have done a lot<br />\nbetter.\" He also felt the team<br />\nas a whole could have done better, but there were some encouraging points for the future.<br />\n\"We had a good, strong turnout from the freshmen this<br />\nyear,\" he said. \"Neil Porter,<br />\nDan Pressel, Steve Tristani and<br />\nNick Perrin all wrestled real<br />\nwell, and should really help us<br />\nnext year. With the right attitude, I think we could have a<br />\nreally good team.\"<br />\n<br />\nChester Wagstaff<br />\n<br />\nHe also turned in a stellar performance, compiling a record<br />\nof 11 wins and six losses.<br />\n\"Joel's a strong wrestler,\"<br />\ncommented Wagstaff.\"In fact,<br />\nI'd say he's probably the best<br />\nwrestler on the team right now,<br />\nand what's more, he's a good<br />\nleader.\"<br />\n<br />\nJoel Eichler, the other captain, is a 158-pound junior<br />\nfrom Short Hills, New Jersey.<br />\n<br />\nEichler wrestled for Millburn<br />\nHigh School in Millburn, New<br />\nJersey, where he lettered twice.<br />\nAs a 141-pound senior, he<br />\nfinished first in his district tournament and third in the<br />\nregionals. This led to his being<br />\nrecruited to wrestle here by the<br />\nformer wrestling coach, Wil-<br />\n<br />\nAlthough disappointed with<br />\nhis team's finish, Eichler was<br />\nable to point out several bright<br />\nspots. \"Along with Chester<br />\nhaving a great year, Rich Grohol also finally came around<br />\nand had a good season.\"<br />\n(Grohol was 17-7, and finished<br />\nham Anderson. Since then, fifth in the MAC tournament\u2014<br />\nthings have only gotten better, the best finish for a Blue Jay<br />\nas Eichler has lettered every wrestler this year.) Eichler also<br />\nyear since he joined the team as had positive thoughts for next<br />\na freshman. Next year should year's team. \"Losing Chester<br />\nhold even better things for will definitely hurt us,\" he<br />\nEichler. \"I've got a good shot noted. \"But we've got about<br />\nat competing for the MAC ti- four guys coming back who<br />\nshould form the heart of next<br />\ntle next year,\" he said.<br />\nyear's team. And if we get some<br />\ngood freshmen\u2014maybe a heavy<br />\nguy and a light guy\u2014we should<br />\ndo real well.\"<br />\nCoach John Kohler was quite<br />\nproud of his two co-captains<br />\nthis season. \"I think that, as a<br />\nsenior, Chester had his best<br />\nseason,\" he said. \"It was unfortunate that he didn't place in<br />\nthe MAC tournament. He<br />\nmade an outstanding contribution to the program. The program will miss him next year.\"<br />\nOf Eichler, Coach Kohler<br />\nsaid, \"Joel had a good year,<br />\nand he could have had a better<br />\none. He has the potential to<br />\nhave a very good year next<br />\nyear. He could place in the<br />\nMACs. I think Joel's got some<br />\nthings to prove to himself next<br />\nyear.

But by demonstrating the roundness of our planet,<br />\nwhich opened a hermetically sealed door, our astronomer discovered the invariable laws<br />\nof a solar system that now allow us to accurately predict an eclipse and land on the moon.<br />\nLikewise, by demonstrating the complete falseness of the logical theory that has gotten<br />\na dogmatic hold on the mind, which opened another hermetically sealed door, I discovered .2<br />\na natural, psychological, invariable law of a mankind system that now allows us to accurately 5<br />\npredict and accomplish what was never before possible\u2014our permanent deliverance from 7.<br />\nwar, crime, and the other evils of human relation plaguing our lives. However, because<br />\nthis will be difficult for any person acquainted with history and human nature to believe,<br />\nor even conceive, and because it is imperative that this knowledge, this fantastic<br />\nbreakthrough, be brought to light as quickly as possible, I will hold a seminar, the date<br />\nto be announced, after those interested in attending have studied the principles regarding<br />\nthis discovery. For that purpose, they may borrow from the library, without paying any<br />\nmoney, a copy of the book titled Beyond ThelFramework of Modern Thought, written and<br />\npublished by -mVself, Seymour Lessans, and study, at the very least, the first 3 chapter.<br />\nTelephone 764-28231or 358-728g.

During the course of<br />\nthe season, six matches were<br />\ncanceled, mostly due to weather. Most recently, the Valen-<br />\n<br />\nRich Grohol led the Jays at MAC's.<br />\n<br />\ntine's Day weekend four-way<br />\nmatch against Ursinis, Swarthmore and Widener was snowed<br />\nout.<br />\n<br />\nThe team's final season<br />\nrecord was 3-10, with four of its<br />\nlosses coming at the hands of<br />\nDivision I schools. All in all,<br />\n<br />\ntion is the team's ability to field<br />\nwrestlers at all positions, mainly due to the consistent participation of Neil Porter at 118.<br />\nLast year, the team forfeited all<br />\n15 matches at that weight.<br />\nKohler sited Grohol and<br />\nsenior Lee Wagstaff as the<br />\nteam's most consistent and<br />\nvaluable competitors.

The Blue<br />\nJays finished at 7-17 overall,<br />\nwith a 5-5 record in the MAC<br />\nSoutheast, leaving Hopkins tied<br />\nwith Ursinus for third in the<br />\ndivision.<br />\nEarly in the game it appeared<br />\nHopkins was tournamentbound. The Jays came back<br />\nfrom an early 10-3 deficit and<br />\ntook a 20-17 lead at the midpoint of the first period.<br />\nHowever, turnovers coupled<br />\nwith poor rebounding allowed<br />\nWashington to go on a 24-6<br />\ntear. At halftime the Jays<br />\nfound themselves down by 12,<br />\n47-35.<br />\nThe Jays traded baskets with<br />\nWashington for the first eight<br />\nminutes of the second half.<br />\nWith 11:32 remaining in the<br />\ngame, Glen Wall fouled out.<br />\nThe loss of their playmaker<br />\nbadly hurt them. Wall had also<br />\n<br />\nChris McShea<br />\n<br />\nbeen keeping the hoopsters in<br />\nthe game with his shooting during the second half. After his<br />\ndeparture, Washington took<br />\ncontrol of the game. They lead<br />\nby 28 at one point and won by<br />\na score of 103-79.<br />\nThe Jays shot 51.5 percent<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nfor the game and were 13 of 21<br />\nfrom the foul line. But they<br />\ncommitted 24 turnovers.<br />\nPoor officiating was a major<br />\nfactor in this game, according<br />\nto coach Nappy Doherty.<br />\n\"Three questionable offensive<br />\nfouls in the first half took six<br />\npoints away from us, and this<br />\n'may have been a key to the<br />\ngame.\"<br />\nHopkins was called for 33<br />\nfouls during the game, and<br />\nthree Blue Jays fouled out:<br />\nWall, Bob Clayton and Bob<br />\nWilson.<br />\n\"Though there seemed to be<br />\nmany very questionable calls, as<br />\nthe refs appeared to be influenced by the crowd, it is<br />\nhard to blame the refs for our<br />\nloss,\" offered co-captain Gary<br />\nBenninghoff. \"Washington outhustled us, and their swarming<br />\ndefense took us out of our<br />\noffense.\"<br />\nBenninghoff lead Hopkins<br />\nscoring with 19.

It has also been<br />\nproposed that an alumni employment network be developed<br />\nto find jobs for students in the<br />\ncommunity and the private sector, as well as within the<br />\nUniversity, while the student is<br />\nin school.<br />\nFunding for such programs<br />\nshould come from endowment<br />\nmoney.

He objects, however, to lending to students on such a basis.<br />\nMoreover, he raises questions<br />\nabout the morality of offering<br />\nstudent aid to those students<br />\nwho do not demonstrate sufficient financial need.

The council believes that it is unfair to<br />\ncharge the normal McCoy rent<br />\nto the 35 freshmen who were<br />\nforced to live in the upperclassmen apartment building<br />\nbecause of lack of space in the<br />\nfreshman dormitories. The normal rent for McCoy apartments<br />\nis $145 more per year than the<br />\nrent for a double room in the<br />\ndormitories.<br />\nThe Student Council Housing Committee, under the<br />\nleadership of Chairman Mike<br />\nKun and member Steve Sugretto, has been investigating the<br />\nissue since late last semester,<br />\nand Kun and Sugretto brought<br /><br />\nBettye Miller<br /><br />\nthe matter before the entire<br />\ncouncil Wednesday night. The<br />\ncouncil unanimously passed a<br />\nresolution urging the University to refund the $145 difference. Additionally, the<br />\nresolution calls upon the administration to establish a<br />\npolicy for the future \"whereby<br />\neither freshmen forced to live<br />\noff-campus would pay no more<br /><br />\nthan those on-campus or freshmen 'would be given the option<br />\nof living in off-campus buildings<br />\nin the event that an overrun<br />\nsituation did occur.\"<br />\nKun said he believes charging<br />\nthe freshmen the McCoy rate is<br />\nunfair because the students did<br />\nnot choose to be placed in<br />\nMcCoy, and because they are<br />\npaying for cooking facilities<br />\nthat they do not use. Freshmen<br />\nplaced in McCoy are given the<br />\noption of getting off the meal<br />\nplan, but this year only three<br />\ndid so.<br />\nDirector of Auxilary Services<br />\nBettye Miller said she thinks the<br />\nfreshmen living in McCoy are<br />\npaying \"a fair price for what<br />\nthey're getting.\"<br />\nMiller pointed out that it is<br />\nclearly stated in the housing<br />\n'cont. on p. 2<br /><br />\nPAGE 2/FEBRUARY 25 1983<br /><br />\nSC Tries To Get Refund For McCoy Freshmen<br />\ncont. from p.

Miller denied that<br />\nsuch a letter was ever sent.<br />\n\"They did not get any kind<br /><br />\nof letter which said they would<br />\nbe charged the dormitory<br />\nrates,\" Miller said, \"at least,<br />\nnot from me.\"<br />\nInterestingly enough, there is<br />\ncurrently empty space in the<br />\ndormitories. According to Miller, spaces began to open up<br />\nduring registration, when<br />\nstudents decided at the last<br />\nminute not to attend Hopkins<br />\nor left the school for some<br /><br />\nreason. The freshmen placed in<br />\nMcCoy have the option of<br />\nmoving into the dormitories<br />\nwhen such spaces open up, in<br />\nwhich case they would be charged the dormitory rates.

Kaye said that the \"most<br />\nfeasible\" solution to this problem would be for the University<br />\nto buy an apartment building<br />\nnear campus, but that this<br />\ncreates \"community problems.\"<br />\nKaye also suggested that the<br />\nUniversity work with the city<br />\nand state governments to<br />\nstrengthen anti-co-op laws.<br />\nAlthough he said that he<br />\ndoes not believe that the<br />\nUniversity will ever be able to<br />\nhouse all students, Kaye said he<br />\nthinks the University should attempt to ensure that students do<br />\nnot \"lose contact with the<br />\ncampus.\"<br />\n\"I think the University<br />\nshould strive to accommodate<br />\n[in University-owned housing]<br />\nas many students as possible,\"<br />\nKaye said.<br /><br />\nORIENTATION '83<br />\nwill interview for<br /><br />\nMMITTEE CHAIRMEN<br />\nMarch<br /><br />\n3, 4<br /><br />\n*Moviat oin<br />\n*Transfer<br /><br />\n*Social<br />\n*Commuter<br /><br />\nIP<br /><br />\n*Parent<br />\nSign up for an interview at the Office of Residential Life<br />\nand pick up a job description.<br />\nQuestions or Problems?<br />\nContact Jon at 2354177<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/PAGE 3<br /><br />\nDavid Upset With Nuclear Freeze Movement<br />\nBY BARBARA BUSHARIS<br /><br />\nvive a first strike, survivability tion of nuclear weapons, but<br />\nof weapons and not sheer num- not of systems which could<br />\nThe proposed nuclear freeze bers is crucial.

Those students<br />\nwho qualify would be expected<br />\nto draw first on federal work<br />\nstudy and loan programs, allowing them to receive grants<br />\nonly if other sources of aid proved insufficient.<br />\nThe present federal financial<br />\naid system considers the Pell<br />\nGrant as the basic source of<br />\naid, with work study and loans<br />\nas supplements. So, in effect,<br />\nthe Reagan proposal is a reversal of the present priorities for<br />\nallocating funds.<br />\nThe adoption of Reagan's<br />\npolicies would result in the<br /><br />\nreduction of the number of<br />\ngrant programs from three to<br />\none, and generally increase<br />\ngrants to low income students<br />\nwhile reducing or denying<br />\ngrants to most middle income<br />\nstudents.<br />\nSuch a shift in aid from middle- to lower-class families<br />\nwould especially hurt a school<br />\nsuch as Hopkins, where the majority of students on financial<br />\naid are from middle-class<br />\nfamilies.<br />\nSpecifically, the administration proposes to eliminate<br />\naltogether the State Student Incentive Grants and the Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants. The remaining<br />\nfederal grant program, the Pell<br />\nGrant, would be renamed a<br />\n\"self-help\" grant and resealed.<br />\nCurrently the maximum that a<br />\nstudent can receive from a Pell<br />\nGrant is $1800.

There are another 160 to<br />\n170 foreign graduate students,<br />\nplus 60 to 70 foreign faculty<br />\nand post-doctorates. This<br />\nnumber has been steadily increasing, according to Dianne<br />\nRichey, director of the Office<br />\nof Foreign Student and Faculty Services. Open Doors:<br />\n1980/81, a publicatio.: of the<br />\nInstitute of International<br />\nEducation, recorded 161<br />\nforeign students at Hopkins<br />\nduring the 1979-80 academic<br />\nyear and 181 in 1980-81.<br />\nForeign students decide to attend Hopkins for a variety of<br />\nreasons, many of them no different from those of the averge<br />\nAmerican student. The most<br />\nprevalent reason comes from<br />\nthe academic standpoint: \"The<br />\neducation is tops,\" says Karina<br />\nRobinson, a freshman from<br />\nSpain. Thanasis Simos, a sophomore, agrees: \"The quality of<br />\neducation is much better here<br />\nthan it is in Greece.\" Junior<br />\nTerrence Yau never even considered going to college in his<br />\nnative Hong Kong. He attributes this to the lack of a good<br /><br />\npre-medical program at both<br />\nmajor universities in that<br />\ncountry.<br />\nHopkins seems to draw<br />\nforeign undergraduates with<br />\nsome American background.<br />\nRobinson went to a British<br />\nschool in Madrid, and later to<br />\na boarding school in the U.S.,<br />\nso she knew how the American<br />\neducational system worked.<br />\nSimos' high school in Greece<br />\nhad an American administration. This, is says, is part of the<br />\nreason why he decided to continue his education in the U.S.<br />\nIbrahim Guney, a sophomore,<br />\nand Naim Benmayor, a junior,<br />\nboth electrical engineering majors from Turkey, graduated<br />\nfrom an American high school<br />\nin Turkey and \"grew up in an<br />\nAmerican-oriented system,\"<br />\naccording to Benmayor. Yau,<br />\nhaving lived in the U.S. as a<br />\nchild, did not find life here very<br />\nunusual.<br />\nAcademic differences is a<br />\ncommon explanation for the<br />\ndecision to leave one's home<br />\ncountry in search of higher<br />\neducation. For Yau, Hopkins<br />\nproved a natural choice. \"Hopkins is definitely better [academically],\" he says in regard<br />\nto his Biology major, but feels<br />\nthat the quality of education for<br />\nother majors is equivalent to<br /><br />\nthat in Hong Kong. \"1 he<br />\nuniversities there are much<br />\nlarger than Hopkins,\" he says,<br />\ncomparing the two. \"And<br />\nabout 90 percent Chinese.\"<br />\nOne negative aspect he sees at<br />\nHopkins is that \"the curriculum is more inflexible than<br />\nI thought.\"<br />\nAccording to Simos, Greece<br />\nhas one main university with<br />\nseveral campuses. \"People are<br />\nassigned to campuses according<br />\nto their grades,\" so there is a<br />\ndiversity to the student population, but to a lesser degree than<br />\nin the U.S. An Electrical Engineering major, Simos has<br />\nfound it easier to deal with<br />\ncomputers at Hopkins. \"The<br />\nlabs are more extensive here.<br />\nWhile in Greece there is more<br />\nmaterial to cover, in practice<br />\nHopkins gives you an advantage.\"<br />\nSpain's system of higher<br />\neducation is far different from<br />\nthe U.S., according to Robinson, an International Relations<br />\nmajor. \"Almost everyone goes<br />\nto the university in or near their<br />\nhometown.\" Students live at<br />\nhome and generally do not<br />\nmove out until they are older<br />\nand have a job. The universities<br />\nare also overcrowded.

The News-Letter's biggest problem is that too many Hopkins<br />\nstudents do not know how to write well. Yet<br />\nthe News-Letter is forced to draw its writers<br />\nfrom this pool of illiterates. Because there<br />\nare only'a limited number of good writers<br />\nat JHU, the problem becomes quite severe<br />\nwhen it is necessary for someone to have<br />\ncompetent writing skills as well as expertise<br />\nabout a particular subject matter. Hopkins<br /><br />\nundergraduates, however, do not deserve full ,<br />\nblame for this unfortunate situation. The<br />\nUniversity should shoulder the responsibility<br />\nof ensuring that all students graduate from<br />\nthis institution with the ability to write well,<br />\nnot for the News-Letter's sake, but as an end<br />\nin itself. In order to accomplish this, it would<br />\nrequire major changes in the curriculum and:<br />\nthe academic requirements of undergraduates. Although there is some talk of making curriculum changes in this direction, such<br />\nplans are long range and it will likely be<br />\nmany years before they are implemented.<br /><br />\nA Journalism Workshop At Hopkins<br />\nIn an effort to fill the void of journalistic undergraduates who work on campus pubinstruction, at MU, the News-Letter has lications.

Presently,<br />\nhowever, there is no professor capable of<br />\nteaching such a course. This is not an insurmountable obstacle. Instead of hiring a fulltime faculty member to teach journalism, the<br /><br />\ndepartment could conceivably hire an adjunct professor; someone who would merely instruct one class per semester. It would<br />\nprobably be possible to employ a staff<br />\nmember of one of the major Baltimore<br />\nnewspapers for this purpose.<br />\nRussell Baker's visit to JHU earlier this<br />\nweek serves as a reminder that Hopkins<br />\ngraduates have met with success in the field<br />\nof journalism. In all probability, others will<br />\ncontinue to do so. Yet Hopkins' academic<br />\ncurriculum, if it remains unchanged, will be<br />\nof little or no help.

The University maintains it may be losing a number<br />\nof top-notch students because<br />\nof its failure to compete with<br />\nattractive merit-based awards<br />\noffered at other competitive<br />\nschools.<br />\nIn response to these concerns, the Undergraduate Financial Aid 2000 committee,<br />\ncomposed of administrators,<br />\nfaculty, students and financial<br />\naid officers, is investigating the<br />\npossibility of initiating new<br />\nmerit-based \u2022rograms at Ho\u2022<br /><br />\nThe Spring Ball<br />\nJointly Sponsored By:<br /><br />\nR.O.T.C.

Although<br />\nHopkins sponsors one such<br />\nscholarship, the beneficial Hodson, the committee has found<br /><br />\nthat it alone does not compete<br />\nwith other schools' more extensive programs. Colleges such as<br />\nUnion (NY), Emolry(GA), and<br />\nthe University of North Carolina entice prospective students<br />\nwith four-year full-tuition<br />\nscholarships, internships and<br />\npaid living expenses.

Cyrrently at Hopkins,<br />\nstudents receive only $260,000<br />\nin Pell Grants, while they<br />\nreceive $700,000 from SEOG<br />\nand SSIG programs. Further,<br />\nthe lowering of the income ceiling to $20,000 would greatly affect Hopkins students because<br />\nthe average family income of a<br />\nstudent receiving aid is $35,000.<br /><br />\nFinancial Aid Director Susan<br />\nBroadbent foresees a serious<br />\nproblem if the new proposals<br />\nare accepted. She is \"very concerned\" with \"this significant<br />\nloss in federal funding\" and is<br />\nnot certain as to where she will<br />\nfind funds to compensate for<br />\nsuch a loss. Further, she does<br />\nnot feel that the expansion of<br />\nthe current work-study program will be helpful to Hopkins<br />\nstudents because \"they are<br />\nalready working very hard.\"<br />\nBroadbent emphasizes the<br />\nfact that these proposed changes will not take effect until the<br />\n1-984-85 academic year because<br />\nof forward funding.<br />\nShe also stresses that these<br />\nare just proposals and therefore<br />\nthe specific effect on students<br />\ncan not be measured until the<br />\ndetails are known.<br />\nMoreover, the proposals are<br />\nsubject to the approval of Congress.

This led to his being<br />\nrecruited to wrestle here by the<br />\nformer wrestling coach, Wil-<br /><br />\nAlthough disappointed with<br />\nhis team's finish, Eichler was<br />\nable to point out several bright<br />\nspots. \"Along with Chester<br />\nhaving a great year, Rich Grohol also finally came around<br />\nand had a good season.\"<br />\n(Grohol was 17-7, and finished<br />\nham Anderson.

But by demonstrating the roundness of our planet,<br />\nwhich opened a hermetically sealed door, our astronomer discovered the invariable laws<br />\nof a solar system that now allow us to accurately predict an eclipse and land on the moon.<br />\nLikewise, by demonstrating the complete falseness of the logical theory that has gotten<br />\na dogmatic hold on the mind, which opened another hermetically sealed door, I discovered .2<br />\na natural, psychological, invariable law of a mankind system that now allows us to accurately 5<br />\npredict and accomplish what was never before possible\u2014our permanent deliverance from 7.<br />\nwar, crime, and the other evils of human relation plaguing our lives.

During the course of<br />\nthe season, six matches were<br />\ncanceled, mostly due to weather. Most recently, the Valen-<br /><br />\nRich Grohol led the Jays at MAC's.<br /><br />\ntine's Day weekend four-way<br />\nmatch against Ursinis, Swarthmore and Widener was snowed<br />\nout.<br /><br />\nThe team's final season<br />\nrecord was 3-10, with four of its<br />\nlosses coming at the hands of<br />\nDivision I schools.

The Blue<br />\nJays finished at 7-17 overall,<br />\nwith a 5-5 record in the MAC<br />\nSoutheast, leaving Hopkins tied<br />\nwith Ursinus for third in the<br />\ndivision.<br />\nEarly in the game it appeared<br />\nHopkins was tournamentbound. The Jays came back<br />\nfrom an early 10-3 deficit and<br />\ntook a 20-17 lead at the midpoint of the first period.<br />\nHowever, turnovers coupled<br />\nwith poor rebounding allowed<br />\nWashington to go on a 24-6<br />\ntear. At halftime the Jays<br />\nfound themselves down by 12,<br />\n47-35.<br />\nThe Jays traded baskets with<br />\nWashington for the first eight<br />\nminutes of the second half.<br />\nWith 11:32 remaining in the<br />\ngame, Glen Wall fouled out.<br />\nThe loss of their playmaker<br />\nbadly hurt them. Wall had also<br /><br />\nChris McShea<br /><br />\nbeen keeping the hoopsters in<br />\nthe game with his shooting during the second half. After his<br />\ndeparture, Washington took<br />\ncontrol of the game. They lead<br />\nby 28 at one point and won by<br />\na score of 103-79.<br />\nThe Jays shot 51.5 percent<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nfor the game and were 13 of 21<br />\nfrom the foul line. But they<br />\ncommitted 24 turnovers.<br />\nPoor officiating was a major<br />\nfactor in this game, according<br />\nto coach Nappy Doherty.<br />\n\"Three questionable offensive<br />\nfouls in the first half took six<br />\npoints away from us, and this<br />\n'may have been a key to the<br />\ngame.\"<br />\nHopkins was called for 33<br />\nfouls during the game, and<br />\nthree Blue Jays fouled out:<br />\nWall, Bob Clayton and Bob<br />\nWilson.<br />\n\"Though there seemed to be<br />\nmany very questionable calls, as<br />\nthe refs appeared to be influenced by the crowd, it is<br />\nhard to blame the refs for our<br />\nloss,\" offered co-captain Gary<br />\nBenninghoff. \"Washington outhustled us, and their swarming<br />\ndefense took us out of our<br />\noffense.\"<br />\nBenninghoff lead Hopkins<br />\nscoring with 19.
