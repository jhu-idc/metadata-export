Bryllion Fagin, Associate Professor Emeritus of English and Drama,<br />\nStated in an interview Wednesday that<br />\ntheatre and drama must be regarded<br />\nas an integral part of the humanities,<br />\nLkd that the university must endeavor<br />\nto \"keep alive\" the traditions in the fine<br />\nThe former chairman of the now<br />\ndefunct Drama Department added that<br />\nCollege theatre is becoming increasingly<br />\nknportant as a \"training ground for<br />\nthe future.\"<br />\nDr. Fagin was appointed Assistant<br />\nProfessor 'of English after he obtained<br />\nkds doctorate in English here in 1932.<br />\nHis interest in the theatre stems from<br />\nhis early years in New York. He began<br />\nstudying English at Michigan Agricultural College and later transferred to<br />\nGeorge Washington University where<br />\nhe obtained his BA in English. He then<br />\nattended Columbia for a short time<br />\nuntil finances caused him to return to<br />\nGeorge Washington and attend afternoon classes while working for the government.<br />\nAfter getting his MA, Dr. Fagin came<br />\nto Baltimore to teach at the University<br />\nOf Maryland School of Medicine and<br />\nDentistry. He became an instructor in<br />\nAmerican drama at Hopkins in 1926<br />\nand was chosen as director for the<br />\nPlayshop.<br />\nPounded by the English department<br />\nin 1921, the Playshop existed primarily<br />\nfor the purpose of providing quality<br />\nPlays for the faculty and student body.<br />\nIt soon developed into a community<br />\ntheatre when alumni began to return to<br />\ntake active part in the various productions. Dr. Fagin ranks the Playshop as<br />\nsetni-professional since he feels that<br />\nmany of the actors are good enough<br />\nto play professionally. He recalls when<br />\neach year the Playshop would award<br />\na Prize to the author in the group with<br />\nthe best original play and maintains<br />\nthat New York scouts would come to<br />\nreview the productions.<br />\nDr. Fagin was chairman of the Drama<br />\ndepartment during the ten years of its<br />\nexistence. It was abolished several years<br />\nago, at the request of the English de-.<br />\nPartment, probably because of the qUes'Lion of expense necessary to maintain<br />\na good graduate school in drama.<br />\nThe Playshop had no connection with<br />\nthe undergraduate Barnstormers. With<br />\nboth groups sharing the Barn, some<br />\nProblems arose in schedule and budget<br />\n\u2014 the Playshop was not reeeiving subsidy and had to charge admission to<br />\nits productions. Dr. Fagin believes that<br />\nthe Barnstormers has had a positive efrect on the undergraduates. For some<br />\nYears, members of the Barnstormers<br />\nWith high aspirations would take<br />\nCourses from the Department and would<br />\nalso work with the Playshop. This re-<br />\n<br />\nstilted in an intermingling between the<br />\ntwo groups.<br />\nWith the union of the two dramatic<br />\norganizations resulting in Theatre Hopkins, Dr. Fagin said that some things<br />\nhave been lost \u2014 such as the group enthusiasm which the Playshop had. The<br />\nBarnstormers would change every four<br />\nyears, while the Playshop had a \"sense<br />\nof permanance\" with its nucleus of permanent members. He does think, how-<br />\n<br />\nTheatre Hopkins, under the direction<br />\nof Edward Golden, Jr., opened its initial<br />\nseason last night with Eugene Ionesco's<br />\n\"The Killer.\" The play, being presented<br />\nat the Barn, will run thru November 7.<br />\nLast spring, at a time when Hopkins<br />\ndrama was in danger of being extinguished due to lack of support, administration officials, led by Dean G. Wilson<br />\nShaffer and executive to the president<br />\nRoss Jones, obtained Golden to direct<br />\n<br />\nTHEATRE Hopkins began it's fall season last night with Eugene<br />\nIonesco's \"The Killer<br />\n<br />\never, that the new group will be able<br />\nto produce more plays with a greater<br />\nversatility.<br />\nThe greatest problem facing Theatre<br />\nHopkins now is the need for better facilities. Although according to Dr.<br />\nFagin, \"There are good attributes connected with a small theatre,\" he said the<br />\nBarn is not flexible enough to provide<br />\nfor the kind of experimental plays Mr.<br />\nGolden and the Theatre hope to produce. What he feels is needed is a new<br />\nsmall theatre of the Shakespearean<br />\ntype.<br />\nDr. Fagin does not expect any outside financial grant for a resident Hopkins theatre group, although he admitted that the donation of a new theatre<br />\nwould be a great help.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins dramatics, and then gave him<br />\ntheir full support for establishing Theatre Hopkins. In a recent interview,<br />\nJones stated, \"The administration is enthusiastic about the idea of Theatre<br />\nHopkins, and is also pleased with the<br />\nseveral plays produced last summer by<br />\nRick Wesley. University officials are<br />\nhopeful that the new Theatre Hopkins<br />\nplan will result in a quality company<br />\nof benefit both to the University environment and the city in general.\"<br />\nThe newly created Theatre Hopkins<br />\nis a synthesis of the Barnstormers and<br />\nthe Playshop, last year manned by undergraduate and graduates, respectively.<br />\nThrough the union of the two groups,<br />\ndirector Golden hopes to carry out<br />\nmany theatrical innovations that he<br />\nwas unable to implement at the Centre<br />\nStage.<br />\n\"The Hopkins communi0 is the hope<br />\n<br />\nfor a Baltimore theatre,\" he stated. \"In<br />\nmy experience, a good many of the<br />\npeople who support cultural activity are<br />\ndoing it because it is socially acceptable.<br />\nWith respect to resident theatres,<br />\nGolden explained that \"the problem is<br />\nthat the theatre eventually goes begging to the complacent moneyed people.<br />\nThe theatre than becomes subservient<br />\nand does not want to antagonize its<br />\naudience.\"<br />\nProfessor Richard Macksey, of the<br />\nWriting Seminars, expressed his opinion that the academic community is<br />\nthe one hope for experimental theatre.<br />\nHe feels that the choice and sequence<br />\nof the plays to be presented especially<br />\nlend themselves of such experimentation. According to Macksey,\" The Days<br />\nand Nights of Beebee Fenstermaker' has<br />\ngreat potental \u2014 Mr. Golden exercised<br />\ngood judgment in placing it at the end<br />\nof the year, when the less experienced<br />\nactors will have gained some of the<br />\nnecessary background for the main<br />\nroles.\"<br />\nMacksey foresee:; that the potential<br />\nsuccess of Theatre Hopkins may result<br />\nin a more permanent theatrical arrangement, possibly subsidized by the<br />\nEquity foundation or some other private<br />\norganization, or perhaps through the<br />\nCongressional Arts and Humanities Bill.<br />\nSuch financial support would enable<br />\nthe Theatre to employ some professional actors, and would present even greater opportunities for experiment.<br />\nFrom a purely practical standpoint,<br />\naccording to Golden, the combination<br />\nof the Barnstormers and the Playshop<br />\nwill alleviate many of the organizational problems encountered previously<br />\nwhen both groups were forced to produce plays into the Barn. In addition,<br />\nhe believes that the inexperienced undergraduate actors will benefit from the<br />\ncontact with the more experienced<br />\nmembers of the Playshop, which may<br />\nbe considered as being on the semiprofessional level.<br />\nIn addition to Theatre Hopkins, undergraduates will have the opportunity<br />\nto participate in two independently produced Barnstormer presentations, the<br />\nfreshman play and Hopkins' latest musical, \"The Boys from Syracuse.\"<br />\nWhile Theatre Hopkins will operate<br />\nduring the fall and spring semesters,<br />\nthe independent Homewood Summer<br />\nTheatre will present plays during the<br />\nsummer months, completing the yearround schedule of theatrical performances presented on the Johns Hopkins<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe. Homewood Summer Theatre<br />\ncame into being last summer, largely<br />\nthrough the determined efforts of Rick<br />\nWessler, currently a senior at Hopkins.<br />\nAt that time it became apparent that<br />\nthe annual summer Playshop would be<br />\nunable to function as it had for the<br />\npast thirty-four years due to the lack<br />\nof a director. Wessler secured permission from the Hopkins administration<br />\nto use the facilities of the Barn, and<br />\nwith a total contribution from the faculty of $5.00, proceeded,to launch<br />\nsuccessful season.<br />\n<br />\n\fWet Two<br />\n<br />\nNEW<br />\n<br />\nPIOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE.

Why indeed?<br />\nThe answer, officially, is that<br />\nthey are Greek gods, and represent all sport. Why then, one<br />\nmust ask, are they wearing gym<br />\nshorts, and why can one detect<br />\nthe name HutcH lightly cut into<br />\nthe metal? The answer to the<br />\ngym short problem is a simple<br />\none: while genuine Greek athletic garb was proposed, a combined part from the WCTU and<br />\nthe DAR threatened immediate<br />\naction in the form of picketing<br />\nand mass public teetotaling to be<br />\nheld at Homewood. The statues,<br />\nof course, were immediately redesigned. Still we are plagued<br />\nwith the major problem, why is<br />\nthere not a lacrosse player to be<br />\nseen at the National Lacrosse<br />\nHall of Fame? The answer, at<br />\nlast, can be revealed.<br />\nAfter much painstaking research, including extensive interviews with the sculptor, we have<br />\nfound that there is not only one<br />\nlacrosse player in front of the<br />\ngym, there are two. Both of these<br />\nbarefoot boys with cheeks are<br />\nlacrosse players. The truth, it<br />\nseems, lies hidden in history.<br />\nIt has been supposed up to<br />\nnow that the game of lacrosse<br />\nwas invented by the Carlisle Indians in North America. Nothing<br />\ncould be further from the truth.<br />\nLacrosse is an ancient Greek<br />\ngame, played originally in Sparta,.<br />\nIt was used to harden Spartan<br />\nwarriors, and was originally called Rubican, which roughly translated means Monopoly.<br />\nRubicon was played in all the<br />\nOlympic meets, and the standard<br />\nRuibcon uniform consisted of a<br />\nleaf. Leaves of different colors<br />\nwere used to denote different<br />\nteams, and when multieblored<br />\nleaves were not available, as in<br />\nsand-lot Rubicon, they played<br />\n\"shirts and skins\". The game<br />\nwas played on a square field<br />\ntwenty dunams long, with goal<br />\nplaces at opposite corners. The<br />\n<br />\nGREEK God wearing bronze gym shorts and Newsletter fig leaf.<br />\nfield was called a Pythagoris, the<br />\ngoals were called \"legals\" and,<br />\nthe goalie was called the \"legal<br />\ntender\".<br />\nEach sport in Greece had its<br />\npatron gods, known as \"patron<br />\ngods\", who insured that the<br />\ngame be played with little mishap, arid that the home team always win. Today they are called<br />\nrefs. It is here that our two<br />\n\"sportsmen\" come in. While<br />\nmost people assume that these<br />\ntwo statues are just arbitrary<br />\nfigures, they are, in truth, the<br />\nancient patron gods of Lacrosse,<br />\nPyramid and Frisbee. Pyramid<br />\nand Frisbee were charged by<br />\nZeus on high (the big man on<br />\nthe god scene with a gear public<br />\nImage) with \"creating a gayme<br />\nand playe at which the young<br />\nmen of Greece might become<br />\n\"experte,\" so that they might<br />\ntake the Olympics in Tokyo the<br />\nfollowing year. (The _quote is<br />\nstraight from Zeus on high,<br />\nthrough his head press man,),.<br />\nImmediately they set to work,<br />\nand while Pyramid developed the<br />\nfield, Frisbee set to work on the<br />\nimplement to be used. He developed a flexible leather disk<br />\nwith a net stretched inside it,<br />\nmuch like a leather discus. It<br />\nwas to be held like a catcher's<br />\nmitt, and used for catching and<br />\n<br />\nthrowing the ball. It was named<br />\nafter its inventor, and was called<br />\na \"Frisbee\", it is that which the<br />\nstatue is holding in 'his right<br />\nhand. Eventually the frisbee was<br />\nplaced at the end of a stick, and<br />\nthe modern lacrosse stick developed. With the hellanization<br />\nof the world the game spread,<br />\nand in Rome it was often played<br />\nbetween the Christians and the<br />\nLions,with the Lions usually commanding Pythagoris most of the<br />\ngame. A river was named after<br />\nIt. It was in Rome that the<br />\nten man team was developed<br />\nfrom the ancient Minyon principle. The positions were; legal<br />\ntender, left rear legionaire, center mauler, right rear legioner,<br />\nleft center fielder, center fielder,<br />\nright center fielder rear skin,<br />\nmidskin, and fore skin.<br />\nThe game died with the conquest of Rome by the Goths, who<br />\nthought it was to archaic. The<br />\nname however, had been changed<br />\nin Rome to lacrosse, because it<br />\nwas politically expedient. The<br />\ngame somehow got to North<br />\nAmerica via the trans-Atlantic<br />\nland bridge, where it was picked<br />\nup by the Indians, who thought<br />\nIt would be a good way to dupe<br />\nsettlers into coming out of their<br />\nfortified towns.

Most of my friends who were married at the same<br />\ntirne have wives who chase cars all day. 1 myself have never<br />\nhad this trouble, and I attribute my good fortune to the<br />\nfact that 1 have never struck my wife with my hand.I have<br />\nalways used a folded newspaper, even during the prolonged<br />\nnewspaper strike of 1961 in New York. During this journalless period [had the airmail edition of the Manchester Guardian flown in daily from England. I must admit, however,<br />\nthat it was not entirely satisfactory. The airmail edition of<br />\nthe Guardian is printed on paper so light and flimsy that it<br />\nmakes very little impression when one smacks one's wife.<br />\nMine, in fact, thought it was some kind of game and tore<br />\nseveral pairs of my trousers.<br />\nBut I digress.

For twelve years, I say, this column has<br />\nbeen discussing, forthrightly and fearlessly, such burning<br />\ncampus questions as \"Should students be allowed to attend<br />\nfirst-hour classes in pajamas?\" and \"Should deans be retired at age 25?\" and \"Should foreign exchange students be<br />\nheld for ransom?\".<br />\nToday,continuing the tradition, we take up the thorniest<br />\nacademic problem of all: the high cost of tuition. Let me<br />\ntell you how one student, Lintel Sigafoos by name,solved<br />\nthis problem.<br />\nLintel, while still a boy in Straitened Circumstances,<br />\nIdaho, had his heart set on college, but, alas, he couldn't<br />\nafford the tuition. He applied for a Regents Scholarship<br />\nbut, alas, his reading speed was not very rapid\u2014only two<br />\nwords an hour\u2014and before he finished even the first<br />\npage<br />\nof his exam, the Regents had closed their briefcases crossly<br />\nand gone home. Lintel then applied for an athletic scholarship, but he had,alas, only a single athletic skill\u2014balancing<br />\nan ice cream cone on his chin\u2014and this, alas, aroused only<br />\nfleeting enthusiasm among the coaches.<br />\nAnd then he found the answer: he would get a<br />\nloan! Of course, he would have to pay it back after student<br />\ntion, but clever Lintel solved that, too: he kept graduahis major, never accumulating enough credits to changing<br />\ngraduate<br />\nuntil he was 66 years old. Then he repaid the loan out<br />\nof his<br />\nSocial Security.<br />\nWhere there's a will, there's a way.<br />\n* * *<br />\n4/)19115, Max Shulitias\u2018<br />\n<br />\nThe makers of Personnae Stainless<br />\nSteel Blades<br />\nShave are happy to bring you another season and Burma<br />\nof Max Shutman's uneerasored, uninhibited, and unpredictable<br />\nWe think you'll be happy, too, when you try our column.<br />\nproducts.,<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE TEN<br />\n<br />\nlarritas IhiLI<br />\n(Continued from Page 6)<br />\nguilt) but in judging him (le.<br />\nhanding down an arbitrary punishment).

The Honor Commission, in<br />\ncoming to a verdict of guilty,<br />\nmust decide that an act performed is not acceptable to those<br />\nstandards set up by the community. The trial panel is not<br />\njudging the moral character of<br />\nthe accused, but whether or not<br />\nthe act which he performed has<br />\nhurt the community.

Not really. 900, of the Republican vote going to Lindsay<br />\nmeans only 19% of the general<br />\nvote. The fact that Lindsay carries the title of Republican in<br />\nNew York City indicates his intimate association with the 1929<br />\nAdams'<br />\ndepression, Sherman<br />\nvicuna coat, Barry Goldwater,<br />\nthe John Birch Society, H. L.<br />\nHunt, Fisk and Gould's cornering of the gold market, and<br />\ntouches of the Bubonic plague.<br />\nThe unfortunate fact remains<br />\nthat if John Lindsay wins in<br />\nNew York City, the Conservative Buckleyite,s will claim that<br />\nhe won in spite of the Republican Party, rather than because<br />\nof it. This is unfair and untruthful. The conservative party,<br />\nas well as most other third party<br />\nmovements, are a menace to the<br />\ntwo party system. By imagining<br />\nthemselves as Republicans, they<br />\nblemish the reputations of true<br />\nRepublicans.<br />\nAnd<br />\nMr.<br />\nO'Dougherty, chairman of the<br />\nConservative Party, claims 30%<br />\nof its membership to be from<br />\nthe Democratic Party. They appeal inherently to a minority<br />\nand thus do not have to face<br />\nissues realistically. Finally, they<br />\nhave non-elected members and<br />\ntherefore, do not have any responsibility to the public or electorate.<br />\nBut what does the so-called<br />\nconservative Republican see in<br />\nthe liberal Lindsay? Both Lindsay and Beame wish to eliminate<br />\npoverty, unemployment, defacto<br />\nsegregation, educational deficiencies, housing problems, medical care problems, hospital shortages, crime, police difficulties,<br />\nand the overall decline of the<br />\ncity. Both Lindsay and Beame's<br />\nproposals will cast as much and<br />\nprobably will create or extend<br />\nthe bureaucracy as much. But<br />\nthe conservative New York Republican sees in Lindsay a break<br />\nwith the past. By that I mean,<br />\nthe hordes of Democratic political payoffs in building contracts,<br />\npainting contracts, the thousands of incompetent \"good<br />\nDemocrats\" on the pay-rolls,<br />\nthe bizarre handling of labor<br />\nstrikes and the inability of the<br />\ncorroded Democratic machine to<br />\ndeal with the problems of the<br />\ncity without selling its soul to<br />\nthe wheeler-dealers in Washington or the state capital.

Republicans are<br />\nnot stiff, dogmatic, theorists.<br />\nThey are human beings interested in good government for<br />\ntheir own self-interest. Therefore, the constructive conservative Republicans \u2014 and there<br />\nare miles of them who want to<br />\nstrengthen the two-party system<br />\n\u2014will vote for John Lindsay.<br />\nAnd if the day ever comes when<br />\na Taft, Murphy, or Nixon have<br />\nas much broad support as Lindsay has in N.Y.C., the liberal<br />\nRepublican will reciprocate and<br />\ncast his vote within the party.<br />\nThe Republican Party is openminded. Do you recall that the<br />\nDemocrats who supported Goldwater have been ostracized from<br />\ntheir Party? I notice, however,<br />\npeople like Lindsay, Keating,<br />\nJavits, McKeldin, and Kuchel<br />\nare still active in the Republican<br />\nParty, and conservatives, like<br />\nTower, Thurmond, and Reagen<br />\nare also maintaining their Republican identity.<br />\nNew York City is known as<br />\nthe. \"ungovernable city.\" And<br />\nthe New York voter is far from<br />\nstupid; he knows as Francis<br />\nParkman wrote, \"Where the carcass is, the vultures gather together.\" Therefore, a Johnson,<br />\nHumphrey, Kennedy, or Buckley<br />\nwill not change the result of the<br />\nelection.

He began<br />\nstudying English at Michigan Agricultural College and later transferred to<br />\nGeorge Washington University where<br />\nhe obtained his BA in English. He then<br />\nattended Columbia for a short time<br />\nuntil finances caused him to return to<br />\nGeorge Washington and attend afternoon classes while working for the government.<br />\nAfter getting his MA, Dr. Fagin came<br />\nto Baltimore to teach at the University<br />\nOf Maryland School of Medicine and<br />\nDentistry. He became an instructor in<br />\nAmerican drama at Hopkins in 1926<br />\nand was chosen as director for the<br />\nPlayshop.<br />\nPounded by the English department<br />\nin 1921, the Playshop existed primarily<br />\nfor the purpose of providing quality<br />\nPlays for the faculty and student body.<br />\nIt soon developed into a community<br />\ntheatre when alumni began to return to<br />\ntake active part in the various productions. Dr. Fagin ranks the Playshop as<br />\nsetni-professional since he feels that<br />\nmany of the actors are good enough<br />\nto play professionally. He recalls when<br />\neach year the Playshop would award<br />\na Prize to the author in the group with<br />\nthe best original play and maintains<br />\nthat New York scouts would come to<br />\nreview the productions.<br />\nDr. Fagin was chairman of the Drama<br />\ndepartment during the ten years of its<br />\nexistence. It was abolished several years<br />\nago, at the request of the English de-.<br />\nPartment, probably because of the qUes'Lion of expense necessary to maintain<br />\na good graduate school in drama.<br />\nThe Playshop had no connection with<br />\nthe undergraduate Barnstormers. With<br />\nboth groups sharing the Barn, some<br />\nProblems arose in schedule and budget<br />\n\u2014 the Playshop was not reeeiving subsidy and had to charge admission to<br />\nits productions. Dr. Fagin believes that<br />\nthe Barnstormers has had a positive efrect on the undergraduates. For some<br />\nYears, members of the Barnstormers<br />\nWith high aspirations would take<br />\nCourses from the Department and would<br />\nalso work with the Playshop. This re-<br /><br />\nstilted in an intermingling between the<br />\ntwo groups.<br />\nWith the union of the two dramatic<br />\norganizations resulting in Theatre Hopkins, Dr. Fagin said that some things<br />\nhave been lost \u2014 such as the group enthusiasm which the Playshop had. The<br />\nBarnstormers would change every four<br />\nyears, while the Playshop had a \"sense<br />\nof permanance\" with its nucleus of permanent members.

Although according to Dr.<br />\nFagin, \"There are good attributes connected with a small theatre,\" he said the<br />\nBarn is not flexible enough to provide<br />\nfor the kind of experimental plays Mr.<br />\nGolden and the Theatre hope to produce. What he feels is needed is a new<br />\nsmall theatre of the Shakespearean<br />\ntype.<br />\nDr. Fagin does not expect any outside financial grant for a resident Hopkins theatre group, although he admitted that the donation of a new theatre<br />\nwould be a great help.<br /><br />\nHopkins dramatics, and then gave him<br />\ntheir full support for establishing Theatre Hopkins. In a recent interview,<br />\nJones stated, \"The administration is enthusiastic about the idea of Theatre<br />\nHopkins, and is also pleased with the<br />\nseveral plays produced last summer by<br />\nRick Wesley. University officials are<br />\nhopeful that the new Theatre Hopkins<br />\nplan will result in a quality company<br />\nof benefit both to the University environment and the city in general.\"<br />\nThe newly created Theatre Hopkins<br />\nis a synthesis of the Barnstormers and<br />\nthe Playshop, last year manned by undergraduate and graduates, respectively.<br />\nThrough the union of the two groups,<br />\ndirector Golden hopes to carry out<br />\nmany theatrical innovations that he<br />\nwas unable to implement at the Centre<br />\nStage.<br />\n\"The Hopkins communi0 is the hope<br /><br />\nfor a Baltimore theatre,\" he stated. \"In<br />\nmy experience, a good many of the<br />\npeople who support cultural activity are<br />\ndoing it because it is socially acceptable.<br />\nWith respect to resident theatres,<br />\nGolden explained that \"the problem is<br />\nthat the theatre eventually goes begging to the complacent moneyed people.<br />\nThe theatre than becomes subservient<br />\nand does not want to antagonize its<br />\naudience.\"<br />\nProfessor Richard Macksey, of the<br />\nWriting Seminars, expressed his opinion that the academic community is<br />\nthe one hope for experimental theatre.<br />\nHe feels that the choice and sequence<br />\nof the plays to be presented especially<br />\nlend themselves of such experimentation. According to Macksey,\" The Days<br />\nand Nights of Beebee Fenstermaker' has<br />\ngreat potental \u2014 Mr. Golden exercised<br />\ngood judgment in placing it at the end<br />\nof the year, when the less experienced<br />\nactors will have gained some of the<br />\nnecessary background for the main<br />\nroles.\"<br />\nMacksey foresee:; that the potential<br />\nsuccess of Theatre Hopkins may result<br />\nin a more permanent theatrical arrangement, possibly subsidized by the<br />\nEquity foundation or some other private<br />\norganization, or perhaps through the<br />\nCongressional Arts and Humanities Bill.<br />\nSuch financial support would enable<br />\nthe Theatre to employ some professional actors, and would present even greater opportunities for experiment.<br />\nFrom a purely practical standpoint,<br />\naccording to Golden, the combination<br />\nof the Barnstormers and the Playshop<br />\nwill alleviate many of the organizational problems encountered previously<br />\nwhen both groups were forced to produce plays into the Barn. In addition,<br />\nhe believes that the inexperienced undergraduate actors will benefit from the<br />\ncontact with the more experienced<br />\nmembers of the Playshop, which may<br />\nbe considered as being on the semiprofessional level.<br />\nIn addition to Theatre Hopkins, undergraduates will have the opportunity<br />\nto participate in two independently produced Barnstormer presentations, the<br />\nfreshman play and Hopkins' latest musical, \"The Boys from Syracuse.\"<br />\nWhile Theatre Hopkins will operate<br />\nduring the fall and spring semesters,<br />\nthe independent Homewood Summer<br />\nTheatre will present plays during the<br />\nsummer months, completing the yearround schedule of theatrical performances presented on the Johns Hopkins<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe.

By keeping a minimum to the majority of the usual alumni class<br />\nnews, the magazine has consistently presented interesting and informative articles on virtually every topic. The<br />\ninterest of the magazine has been to continue educating<br />\nthe alumni; this concern has made it one of the finest<br />\nalumni magazines in the country. The articles, the photography, and the design of the magazine are unmatched by any other such publication and is reason<br />\nfor the many awards that magazine has won during the<br />\npost ten years.<br />\nTony Neville, the editor of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMagazine, and his staff deserve to be encouraged to maintain this level of excellence.<br /><br />\n...

For centuries, at this time of year, men have<br />\naired their autumn folly, by celebrating and ritualizing<br />\ntheir peculiarities.<br />\nThe Celtics are believed to have utilized Halloween<br />\nIn placate the supernatural powers controlling the<br />\nprocesses of nature. They ritualized the practice of divination and its association with the dead, whose soles<br />\nwere supposed to revisit their homes on that day.<br />\nThe Scottish Halloween allows for a ritual which<br />\nM designed to determine who should marry who and<br />\nwhen in the coming year. It is conducted, by tradition, in<br />\nsecret in a barn, where a sieve is used, by a young maiden<br />\nto perform the \"act of winnowing corn.\" After repeating the performance three times the apparition of the<br />\nbe seen in the cofigurafuture husband is supposed to '<br />\nikon of the dispersed corn. The maiden is then, by custom, to go into the field at midnight to sow seeds of<br />\nHemp while repeating this formula: \"Hemp seed I sow,<br />\nlet who will my husband he, let him come and mow...\"<br />\nThe allusions to mowing and sowing inevitably suggest<br />\nthat after this final scene in the cornfield, the question<br />\nof who and when of marriage is given less to the whim<br />\nof the supernatural and given more to the dictates of<br />\nnecessity.<br />\nLately, the youth of America find in Halloween an<br />\nendorsement of the principle that by costuming, by<br />\nadopting a slight change in appearance, or by identifying with a perverse spirit, they are justified in pursuing<br />\ngleeful destruction.<br />\nThe News-Letter endorses an alternative principle,<br />\nthat perversity is best provoked, not by dressing the<br />\npart, but by eating its agitants; and in keeping with its<br />\nmission of realizing the abstract in terms of campus<br />\neut+tom, the News-Letter has prepared the following<br />\nrecipe for the provocation of local perversity and as a<br />\nguide to Halloween at Hopkins the Year round.<br />\nHoot Owl Meat Loaf<br />\n2 pounds ground meet from Robb Tyler<br />\n1 owl face from the tower of Gilman Hall<br />\n2 owl feet from the basement of Gilman Hall<br />\n2 apples given out of spite to Dr.' Morill<br />\nanything cooked by the dormitory cafeteria<br />\nany game played by the football team<br />\na required hook bought at the bookstore, at twice its<br />\nretail amount<br />\nattach two pointed ears from any three of the deans<br />\nand the pinch of a parking ticket<br />\nser it up and let the administration step on it until it is<br />\nmitielched.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCTOBER 29, 1965<br /><br />\nBy HENRY J. KORN<br />\nOn Sunday, October twentyfourth the Baltimore Sun reported that The United States<br />\nArmy had alerted the Baltimore<br />\nPolice to watch for the appearance of souvenir dolls popular<br />\nwith our troops in Viet-Nam. The<br />\ndolls, described as \"colorfully<br />\ncostumed and about fifteen<br />\ninches long\" were feared to have<br />\nbeen wired with explosives by<br />\nViet Cong agents.<br />\nLater editions of the paper reported that the alert had been<br />\ncanceled and that the Army had<br />\ncalled its bomb experts back to<br />\nthe fort. Yet I question the wisdom of relaxing our guard. What<br />\nIf some inscrutable oriental,<br />\nsteeped in the tradition of Fu<br />\nManchu and bitter tea, arose<br />\nfrom an opium stupor, slipped<br />\ninto his basement laboratory to<br />\nperfect the newest ultimate<br />\nweapon; the dynamite BetsyWet-v.<br />\nWorld politics has long been<br />\ndependent on the concept of the<br />\npuppet. The Dolly, too, has had<br />\na place in the history of international relations.

Clearly<br />\nthe doll is coming to the fore<br />\nas a potent political force. It Is<br />\nhoped that the Mattel Company<br />\nstands ready to tool-up for government contracts. The Commies<br />\nmight have Karl Marx for inspiration; thank God we have<br />\nLouie to deliver the goods!<br />\nYet one cannot fail to notice<br />\nthat the description of the<br />\nbooby-trapped dolls coincides<br />\nwith the Barbie Doll, which is<br />\ncharacterized with Boobies of its<br />\nown. Barbie, in many circles, has<br />\nbecome so important as to have<br />\nreplaced St. Christopher on the<br />\ndashboard of the family car. The<br />\ngooks are doubtless waiting for<br />\nChristmas when Santa's Ho Ho<br />\nwill Poetically invoke Chi Minh.<br />\nOne hundred million American<br />\nliving rooms will rock with exCOMMUNIST AGENTS<br />\nplosions and we will look up from<br />\ninto a vast ice cream concern, Amahl and The Night Visitors<br />\nor the Tibetan Lhama who balk- to wonder what the hell haped at remaining a prisoner in a pened.<br />\nChinese fortune cookie.<br />\nHence, in the interest of pubMore recently, Francois Du- lic safety, 1 suggest that when<br />\nvalier, dictator of Haiti, sent a the Un-American Activities Comspecial emissary to the grave miltee gets finished with the Kin<br />\nof President Kennedy to collect Klux Klan that it do a little<br />\na supply of dirt to fill a voodoo checking on Carol Charming.<br /><br />\nGrecian Gods Garb Gym Gear<br />\nBy HocK<br />\n'<br /><br />\nThere has been great comment, in recent days, concerning<br />\nthe two young stalwarts outside<br />\nthe new Phys Ed center who<br />\nare supposed, in their uniquely<br />\nmetallic way, to exemplify the<br />\nfree spirit of sports. \"I can't help<br />\nbut wonder\", its been said again<br />\nand again, why is not at least<br />\none of these jolly green giants<br />\na lacrosse player? Why indeed?<br />\nThe answer, officially, is that<br />\nthey are Greek gods, and represent all sport. Why then, one<br />\nmust ask, are they wearing gym<br />\nshorts, and why can one detect<br />\nthe name HutcH lightly cut into<br />\nthe metal? The answer to the<br />\ngym short problem is a simple<br />\none: while genuine Greek athletic garb was proposed, a combined part from the WCTU and<br />\nthe DAR threatened immediate<br />\naction in the form of picketing<br />\nand mass public teetotaling to be<br />\nheld at Homewood. The statues,<br />\nof course, were immediately redesigned. Still we are plagued<br />\nwith the major problem, why is<br />\nthere not a lacrosse player to be<br />\nseen at the National Lacrosse<br />\nHall of Fame? The answer, at<br />\nlast, can be revealed.<br />\nAfter much painstaking research, including extensive interviews with the sculptor, we have<br />\nfound that there is not only one<br />\nlacrosse player in front of the<br />\ngym, there are two. Both of these<br />\nbarefoot boys with cheeks are<br />\nlacrosse players. The truth, it<br />\nseems, lies hidden in history.<br />\nIt has been supposed up to<br />\nnow that the game of lacrosse<br />\nwas invented by the Carlisle Indians in North America. Nothing<br />\ncould be further from the truth.<br />\nLacrosse is an ancient Greek<br />\ngame, played originally in Sparta,.<br />\nIt was used to harden Spartan<br />\nwarriors, and was originally called Rubican, which roughly translated means Monopoly.<br />\nRubicon was played in all the<br />\nOlympic meets, and the standard<br />\nRuibcon uniform consisted of a<br />\nleaf. Leaves of different colors<br />\nwere used to denote different<br />\nteams, and when multieblored<br />\nleaves were not available, as in<br />\nsand-lot Rubicon, they played<br />\n\"shirts and skins\". The game<br />\nwas played on a square field<br />\ntwenty dunams long, with goal<br />\nplaces at opposite corners. The<br /><br />\nGREEK God wearing bronze gym shorts and Newsletter fig leaf.<br />\nfield was called a Pythagoris, the<br />\ngoals were called \"legals\" and,<br />\nthe goalie was called the \"legal<br />\ntender\".<br />\nEach sport in Greece had its<br />\npatron gods, known as \"patron<br />\ngods\", who insured that the<br />\ngame be played with little mishap, arid that the home team always win. Today they are called<br />\nrefs. It is here that our two<br />\n\"sportsmen\" come in. While<br />\nmost people assume that these<br />\ntwo statues are just arbitrary<br />\nfigures, they are, in truth, the<br />\nancient patron gods of Lacrosse,<br />\nPyramid and Frisbee. Pyramid<br />\nand Frisbee were charged by<br />\nZeus on high (the big man on<br />\nthe god scene with a gear public<br />\nImage) with \"creating a gayme<br />\nand playe at which the young<br />\nmen of Greece might become<br />\n\"experte,\" so that they might<br />\ntake the Olympics in Tokyo the<br />\nfollowing year. (The _quote is<br />\nstraight from Zeus on high,<br />\nthrough his head press man,),.<br />\nImmediately they set to work,<br />\nand while Pyramid developed the<br />\nfield, Frisbee set to work on the<br />\nimplement to be used. He developed a flexible leather disk<br />\nwith a net stretched inside it,<br />\nmuch like a leather discus. It<br />\nwas to be held like a catcher's<br />\nmitt, and used for catching and<br /><br />\nthrowing the ball. It was named<br />\nafter its inventor, and was called<br />\na \"Frisbee\", it is that which the<br />\nstatue is holding in 'his right<br />\nhand. Eventually the frisbee was<br />\nplaced at the end of a stick, and<br />\nthe modern lacrosse stick developed. With the hellanization<br />\nof the world the game spread,<br />\nand in Rome it was often played<br />\nbetween the Christians and the<br />\nLions,with the Lions usually commanding Pythagoris most of the<br />\ngame. A river was named after<br />\nIt. It was in Rome that the<br />\nten man team was developed<br />\nfrom the ancient Minyon principle. The positions were; legal<br />\ntender, left rear legionaire, center mauler, right rear legioner,<br />\nleft center fielder, center fielder,<br />\nright center fielder rear skin,<br />\nmidskin, and fore skin.<br />\nThe game died with the conquest of Rome by the Goths, who<br />\nthought it was to archaic. The<br />\nname however, had been changed<br />\nin Rome to lacrosse, because it<br />\nwas politically expedient. The<br />\ngame somehow got to North<br />\nAmerica via the trans-Atlantic<br />\nland bridge, where it was picked<br />\nup by the Indians, who thought<br />\nIt would be a good way to dupe<br />\nsettlers into coming out of their<br />\nfortified towns. The rest is, of<br />\ncourse, History.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCTOBER 29, 1965<br /><br />\nPAGE RYE<br /><br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br /><br />\nPOETRY<br /><br />\nPOETRY<br /><br />\nRexroth Reading Review<br />\nMr. Elliott Coleman, Chairman of the Department<br />\n410 The Writing Seminars, generously consented to aid<br />\nthe \"News-Letter\" in its policy of drawing on the reaourees of the University to illuminate Campus events,<br />\nand has contributed the following reflection on the<br />\nStature of the poet Kenneth Rexroth.<br />\nBy ,ELLIOTT COLEMAN<br />\nAt 60, Kenneth Rexroth writes as if he were 30.<br />\nNot the solid, complicated verse he wrote at age 18,<br />\nbut the poetry of his 30's\u2014love poetry of the delayed<br />\nreaction----only simpler now, deeper now, even Sprightlier now.

In<br />\nfact, I would not believe so much time has gone by except<br />\nthat I have my wife nearby as a handy reference. When I<br />\nstarted this column,she was a mere slip of a girl\u2014supple as<br />\na willow bough and fair as the morn. Today she is gnarled,<br />\nlumpy, and given to biting the postman. Still, I count my.,<br />\nself lucky. Most of my friends who were married at the same<br />\ntirne have wives who chase cars all day. 1 myself have never<br />\nhad this trouble, and I attribute my good fortune to the<br />\nfact that 1 have never struck my wife with my hand.I have<br />\nalways used a folded newspaper, even during the prolonged<br />\nnewspaper strike of 1961 in New York. During this journalless period [had the airmail edition of the Manchester Guardian flown in daily from England. I must admit, however,<br />\nthat it was not entirely satisfactory. The airmail edition of<br />\nthe Guardian is printed on paper so light and flimsy that it<br />\nmakes very little impression when one smacks one's wife.<br />\nMine, in fact, thought it was some kind of game and tore<br />\nseveral pairs of my trousers.<br />\nBut I digress. For twelve years, I say, I have been writing this column. That is a fact, and here is another: I shave<br />\nevery morning with Personna Stainless Steel Blades.

It<br />\ncomes in Regular or Menthol; it soaks rings around any<br />\nother lather,and it's made by the makers of Personna.<br />\nBut 1 digress. For twelve years, I say, this column has<br />\nbeen discussing, forthrightly and fearlessly, such burning<br />\ncampus questions as \"Should students be allowed to attend<br />\nfirst-hour classes in pajamas?\" and \"Should deans be retired at age 25?\" and \"Should foreign exchange students be<br />\nheld for ransom?\".<br />\nToday,continuing the tradition, we take up the thorniest<br />\nacademic problem of all: the high cost of tuition. Let me<br />\ntell you how one student, Lintel Sigafoos by name,solved<br />\nthis problem.<br />\nLintel, while still a boy in Straitened Circumstances,<br />\nIdaho, had his heart set on college, but, alas, he couldn't<br />\nafford the tuition. He applied for a Regents Scholarship<br />\nbut, alas, his reading speed was not very rapid\u2014only two<br />\nwords an hour\u2014and before he finished even the first<br />\npage<br />\nof his exam, the Regents had closed their briefcases crossly<br />\nand gone home. Lintel then applied for an athletic scholarship, but he had,alas, only a single athletic skill\u2014balancing<br />\nan ice cream cone on his chin\u2014and this, alas, aroused only<br />\nfleeting enthusiasm among the coaches.<br />\nAnd then he found the answer: he would get a<br />\nloan! Of course, he would have to pay it back after student<br />\ntion, but clever Lintel solved that, too: he kept graduahis major, never accumulating enough credits to changing<br />\ngraduate<br />\nuntil he was 66 years old. Then he repaid the loan out<br />\nof his<br />\nSocial Security.<br />\nWhere there's a will, there's a way.<br />\n* * *<br />\n4/)19115, Max Shulitias\u2018<br /><br />\nThe makers of Personnae Stainless<br />\nSteel Blades<br />\nShave are happy to bring you another season and Burma<br />\nof Max Shutman's uneerasored, uninhibited, and unpredictable<br />\nWe think you'll be happy, too, when you try our column.<br />\nproducts.,<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE TEN<br /><br />\nlarritas IhiLI<br />\n(Continued from Page 6)<br />\nguilt) but in judging him (le.<br />\nhanding down an arbitrary punishment). There is a tremendous<br />\ndistinction between trial by one's<br />\npeers and judgment by one's<br />\npeers. The Honor Commission, in<br />\ncoming to a verdict of guilty,<br />\nmust decide that an act performed is not acceptable to those<br />\nstandards set up by the community. The trial panel is not<br />\njudging the moral character of<br />\nthe accused, but whether or not<br />\nthe act which he performed has<br />\nhurt the community.

Not really. 900, of the Republican vote going to Lindsay<br />\nmeans only 19% of the general<br />\nvote. The fact that Lindsay carries the title of Republican in<br />\nNew York City indicates his intimate association with the 1929<br />\nAdams'<br />\ndepression, Sherman<br />\nvicuna coat, Barry Goldwater,<br />\nthe John Birch Society, H. L.<br />\nHunt, Fisk and Gould's cornering of the gold market, and<br />\ntouches of the Bubonic plague.<br />\nThe unfortunate fact remains<br />\nthat if John Lindsay wins in<br />\nNew York City, the Conservative Buckleyite,s will claim that<br />\nhe won in spite of the Republican Party, rather than because<br />\nof it. This is unfair and untruthful. The conservative party,<br />\nas well as most other third party<br />\nmovements, are a menace to the<br />\ntwo party system. By imagining<br />\nthemselves as Republicans, they<br />\nblemish the reputations of true<br />\nRepublicans.<br />\nAnd<br />\nMr.<br />\nO'Dougherty, chairman of the<br />\nConservative Party, claims 30%<br />\nof its membership to be from<br />\nthe Democratic Party. They appeal inherently to a minority<br />\nand thus do not have to face<br />\nissues realistically. Finally, they<br />\nhave non-elected members and<br />\ntherefore, do not have any responsibility to the public or electorate.<br />\nBut what does the so-called<br />\nconservative Republican see in<br />\nthe liberal Lindsay? Both Lindsay and Beame wish to eliminate<br />\npoverty, unemployment, defacto<br />\nsegregation, educational deficiencies, housing problems, medical care problems, hospital shortages, crime, police difficulties,<br />\nand the overall decline of the<br />\ncity. Both Lindsay and Beame's<br />\nproposals will cast as much and<br />\nprobably will create or extend<br />\nthe bureaucracy as much. But<br />\nthe conservative New York Republican sees in Lindsay a break<br />\nwith the past. By that I mean,<br />\nthe hordes of Democratic political payoffs in building contracts,<br />\npainting contracts, the thousands of incompetent \"good<br />\nDemocrats\" on the pay-rolls,<br />\nthe bizarre handling of labor<br />\nstrikes and the inability of the<br />\ncorroded Democratic machine to<br />\ndeal with the problems of the<br />\ncity without selling its soul to<br />\nthe wheeler-dealers in Washington or the state capital.

Therefore, the constructive conservative Republicans \u2014 and there<br />\nare miles of them who want to<br />\nstrengthen the two-party system<br />\n\u2014will vote for John Lindsay.<br />\nAnd if the day ever comes when<br />\na Taft, Murphy, or Nixon have<br />\nas much broad support as Lindsay has in N.Y.C., the liberal<br />\nRepublican will reciprocate and<br />\ncast his vote within the party.<br />\nThe Republican Party is openminded. Do you recall that the<br />\nDemocrats who supported Goldwater have been ostracized from<br />\ntheir Party? I notice, however,<br />\npeople like Lindsay, Keating,<br />\nJavits, McKeldin, and Kuchel<br />\nare still active in the Republican<br />\nParty, and conservatives, like<br />\nTower, Thurmond, and Reagen<br />\nare also maintaining their Republican identity.<br />\nNew York City is known as<br />\nthe. \"ungovernable city.\" And<br />\nthe New York voter is far from<br />\nstupid; he knows as Francis<br />\nParkman wrote, \"Where the carcass is, the vultures gather together.\" Therefore, a Johnson,<br />\nHumphrey, Kennedy, or Buckley<br />\nwill not change the result of the<br />\nelection.
