The<br />\nseminar is designed to increase the<br />\ninterest of student leaders in public affairs by giving them the opportunity to talk informally with<br />\npublic officials.<br />\nConcerning racial matters, the<br />\nGovernor claimed he was following a policy of \"rewarding\" civil<br />\npeace and moderation and attempting to suppress violence. He<br />\nmade his remarks concerning<br />\nBrown in this context. Mr. Brown,<br />\nfacing arrest in Maryland, could<br />\nnot be reached for comment at<br />\nSNCC's New York headquarters.<br />\nAgnew stated that the legislature would soon pass a bill giving<br />\nhim emergency powers to put<br />\ndown civil disorders. Agnew expressed the hope that he would<br />\nnot have to use these powers but<br />\nconceded that \"I am sitting on a<br />\nbomb,and I know it.\"<br />\nIn the two hour session with<br />\nstudent leaders, Governor Agnew<br />\ntouched on the Vietnam War and<br />\nthe 1968 Republican Presidential<br />\nCampaign, but concentrated mostly on issues confronting the State<br />\nGovernment.<br />\nWrong Tack<br />\nConcerning the plight of urban<br />\nareas, Agnew felt that the Poverty<br />\nProgram had taken a wrong tack<br />\nto the situation. He contended<br />\nthat the program had caused more<br />\nand more people to be drawn into<br />\nthe already overcrowded cities.<br />\n<br />\nof the country is only the first to<br />\nbe destroyed, said Mr. Allen; the<br />\nmanual lists the economic structure as the next comonent to be<br />\nhit. The political structure of the<br />\nnation is the third component<br />\ntargeted by the manual for destruction, because a government is<br />\nvulnerable in its relations with its<br />\npeople. In line with this, figures<br />\nshow that six major cities, including Hanoi and Haiphong,<br />\ntwenty- five provincial capitals and<br />\nsixty out of ninety-seven district<br />\ncapitals have been heavily bombed.<br />\nThe manual lists the sociopsychological structure of the nation as the fourth area to be<br />\nattacked. This includes water and<br />\nfood supplies, housing, and certain<br />\nelements of the population, the<br />\npurpose being to cause strikes,<br />\nsabotage and resistance to the<br />\ngovernment. Mr. Allen said that<br />\nthe Catholic population and certain ethnic minorities have been<br />\nespecially hard hit in the bombing.<br />\nHe also saw evidence of widespread use of anti-personnel bombs<br />\nin civilian centers.<br />\nMr. Allen said that this bombing<br />\npolicy closely fits the dictionary<br />\ninformation concerning his own definition of genocide.<br />\nCommenting on the figures of<br />\nprivate life,\" said Dr. Rossi, \"and<br />\nthere is no limit to the extent of planes shot down over North Vietinvestigation provided the social nam, he said that statistics comscientist has the consent of the piled by independent observers in<br />\nhuman subject.

But I am not one to be harsh<br />\nwith those who forgot we are in a new year, for I myself<br />\nhave long been guilty of the same lapse. In fact, in my<br />\nsenior year at college, I wrote 1873 on my papers until<br />\nnearly November of 1874! (It turned out, incidentally,<br />\nnot to be such a serious error because,as we all know,1874<br />\nwas later repealed by President Chester A. Arthur in a fit<br />\nof pique over the Black Tom Explosion. And, as we all<br />\nknow, Mr. Arthur later came to regret his hasty action.<br />\nWho does not recall that famous meeting between Mr.<br />\nArthur and Louis Napoleon when Mr. Arthur said,\"Lou,<br />\nI wish I hadn't of repealed 1874:' Whereupon the French<br />\nemperor made his immortal rejoinder, \"Tipi que nous et<br />\ntyler tu\". Well sir, they had many a good laugh about that,<br />\nas you can imagine.)<br />\nBut I digress. How can we remember to write 1968 on<br />\nour papers and letters? Well sir, the best way is to find<br />\nsomething memorable about 1968,something unique to fix<br />\nit firmly in your mind. Happily, this is very simple because, as we all know, 1968 is the first year in history that<br />\nis divisible by 2, by 5, and by 7. Take a pencil and try it:<br />\n1968 divided by 2 is 984; 1968 divided by 5 is 393%; 1968<br />\ndivided by 7 is 2811/t. This mathematical curiosity will not<br />\noccur again until the year 2079, but we will all be so busy<br />\nthen celebrating the Chester A. Arthur bi-centenerary<br />\nthat we will scarcely have time to be writing papers and<br />\nletters and like that.<br />\n<br />\nAnother clever little trick to fix tile year 1968 in your<br />\nmind is to remember that 1968 spelled backwards is 8691.<br />\n\"Year\" spelled backwards is \"raey:' \"Personna\" spelled<br />\nbackwards is \"Annosrep:' I mention Personna because I<br />\nam paid to write this column by the makers of Personna<br />\nSuper Stainless Steel Blades, and they are inclined to<br />\nwithhold my check if I omit to mention their product.<br />\nNot, mind you, that it is any chore for me to sing the<br />\npraises of Personna, for it is a seemly blade that shaves<br />\nyou cleanly, a gleaming blade that leaves you beaming, a<br />\ntrouble-free blade that leaves you stubble-free, a matchless blade that leaves you scratchless.

And if I seem a bit excessive in my admiration for Personna, I ask you to remember that to me<br />\nPersonna is more than a razor blade; it is also an employer.<br />\nBut I digress. We were speaking of the memorable aspects of 1968 and high among them, of course, is the fact<br />\nthat in 1968 the entire House of Representatives stands<br />\nfor election.There will, no doubt,be many lively and interesting contests, but none, I'll wager, quite so lively and<br />\ninteresting as the one in my own district where the leading candidate is none other than Chester A. Arthur!<br />\nMr. Arthur, incidentally, is not the first ex-president to<br />\ncome out of retirement and run for the House of Representatives. John Quincy Adams was the first. Mr. Adams<br />\nalso holds another distinction: he was the first son of a<br />\npresident ever to serve as president. It is true that Martin<br />\nVan Buren's son, Walter \"Blinky\" Van Buren, was at one<br />\ntime offered the nomination for the presidency, but he,<br />\nalas, had already accepted a bid to become Mad Ludwig<br />\nof Bavaria. James K. Polk's son, on the other hand, became Salmon P. Chase. Millard Fillmore's son went into<br />\naluminum siding.

The News-Letter will continue<br />\nto print it as it is, regardless of any public relations mistakes or<br />\npressure.<br />\n<br />\nOn The Home Front<br />\nWith the federal indictment of Dr. Benjamin Spock, Rev. William Sloan Coffin, Jr., and three others for counseling young men<br />\nto refuse the draft, the Government has again escalated its repression of the anti-war movement. Unable to quash the rising tide of<br />\nopposition to the war with red-baiting and calls for patriotic<br />\nunity, and failing to intimidate dissent with physical violence, as<br />\nexhibited at the Pentagon, the Government has now moved to imprison its opposition. The resort to incarceration is, in itself, highly significant; a government does not jail its opposition unless it<br />\nfeels it to be a real threat to either it or its policies. Yet dissent and<br />\nopposition are the essence of a democracy. If indeed the anti-war<br />\nmovement poses a threat to the Government or its policies, that<br />\nis, it has popular support, the Government's response of imprisonment would- indicate some degree of breakdown of our democracy.<br />\nIf this is the case, one may then legitimately ask where will the<br />\npolitical repression end? The Government's recent action indicates<br />\nits answer to this question, for it has significantly targeted major<br />\nfigures in the anti-war movement who are by no means the most<br />\nextreme and whose \"crime\" is not a major one, even in terms of<br />\nthe Selective Service Act. Indeed, as the Government has already<br />\njailed growing numbers of draft resisters, it is in this context that<br />\nthe recent action of the Government can be termed a serious escalation of political repression with frightening omens for the future.<br />\n<br />\nDiscover America<br />\n<br />\nfistE .rse OSA<br />\n1,4 *of<br />\ncnalgoLET<br />\n<br />\n'Wow 460vr \"TiliZEE WEEKS<br />\nOg THE PEDERNALES ?\"<br />\n<br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\nTelevision, as McLuhan observed in Understanding Media, is the<br />\nmost participatory of the participatory media. You don't merely<br />\nwatch television, you identify with<br />\nit, you view it as you view your<br />\nown dreams, switching your identity from character to character,<br />\n1 returning to the waking world only<br />\nwhen you switch the thing off.<br />\nAs a consequence of their media's invoking a high level of viewer<br />\nparticipation, the ominous magnates of the popular T.V. empire<br />\narrange their presentations to reflect what normally runs through<br />\ntheir viewer's minds - - the mundane and the fantastic. The situation comedy milieu and the soap<br />\nopera are the bland jokes and the<br />\ntired plots of uncounted millions<br />\nof dreary lives. The action fantasies represent the lowest common<br />\ndenominator of the common futile dreams.<br />\nRecently, however, television's<br />\ngreatest problem has been the<br />\nworld's refusal to be either completely mundane or completely<br />\nfantastic. There was no problem<br />\nduring the \"It's All All Right\"<br />\nEisenhower era. But the news of,<br />\nthe sixties, from the election of an<br />\nintelligent President to the national addiction to a pointless war, has<br />\nbeen a series of spectacular events<br />\n<br />\nbuilt upon obscure but /essential\"<br />\npatterns of causation. For television to explain the sixties to the<br />\nviewer would mean substituting a<br />\nclassroom for the highly profitable<br />\nmirror erected in front of the little<br />\nblack box. Such a solution is<br />\nknown as extremism. A better<br />\nsolution had to be found and was.<br />\nEnter Joe Pyne and Alan Burke<br />\n(and a host of their imitators) to<br />\nbring to the public the news as<br />\nseen through their own minds.<br />\nBoth men are narrow-minded, egotistical and obnoxious enough to<br />\nmirror perfectly every prejudice<br />\nand idiosyncracy of the lower middle class listening public. Pyne and<br />\nBurke are the Huntley and Brinkley<br />\nof the BBBC (Bigoted Bellicose<br />\nBroadcasting Company), the popular news network.<br />\nPyne is the straight news man.<br />\nThrough him comes all you need<br />\nto know,not in the aloof statistical<br />\nmanner of the 6:00 p.m. news but<br />\nin the candidly simple, blatent<br />\nform of the Bircher next door.<br />\nThe world is polarized into the<br />\ngood and the bad and especially<br />\nthe simple. Complicated issues<br />\nhave simple and obvious bases, or<br />\nelse they simply don't matter.<br />\nPyne's show is the tabloid of the<br />\nair, the review of this week's<br />\nfreakery. Watching the Joe Pyne<br />\n<br />\nThe Graduate<br />\n<br />\nComing of Age I<br />\nIt is ironic that Hollywood,<br />\nthat once great film capital of<br />\nthe world which everyone was<br />\nbeginning to feel was beyond rejuvenation, is emerging as a slightly<br />\nlagging leader, this time by abandoning the archaic Hollywood<br />\nrules of cinematography<br />\nThe Hollywood rules ran the<br />\nfilm industry and built it into a<br />\ncolossus. But,like all great edifices,<br />\nit was bound to eventually fall<br />\nunder its own weight, only to be<br />\nreplaced by sleeker, more natural<br />\nand less cumbersome conventions.<br />\nParadoxically, the elimination of<br />\nthe tried and tested rules freed the<br />\nindustry from the confinement of<br />\nthe studio,enabled less established<br />\ndirectors to try their often more<br />\ncreative hands, and encouraged<br />\ncameramen to experiment with<br />\nnew techniques unheard of in the<br />\ngolden age of massive dollies and<br />\ntwo ton cameras.<br />\nThe change, of course, was<br />\nprodded by the rising popularity<br />\nand, therefore, box office draw,<br />\nof the Europeans beginning in the<br />\nlate fifties. Resnais' Last Year at<br />\nMarienbad and Fellini's Dolce Vita<br />\nopened many American eyes to<br />\nthe cinematic advantages of facial<br />\nmontages, hand-held cameras, offscreen narration, time-lapse sequences, fast cutting and irregular<br />\nsplicing.<br />\nAll of these previously antiHollywood techniques have been<br />\npresent in the latest batch of<br />\nHollywood products -- Cool Hand<br />\nLuke, In the Heat of the Night,<br />\nGames, Bonnie and Clyde, and<br />\nmost recently The Graduate. Mike<br />\nNichols, who also directed Virginia<br />\nWolff, has produced in The Graduate what is probably the finest<br />\nAmerican film of the year. With<br />\nas keen a feeling for humor as for<br />\npathos as for sensitivity, Nichols<br />\ncarries his audience from one<br />\nmood to another, cutting at precisely the right time, feeling the<br />\nthen<br />\n\"m\"<br />\ntensions, heightening tke<br />\niumor<br />\nsmoothing them out<br />\nand satire.<br />\nIt is not, in retrospect, a happy<br />\nin the end, Ben and Elaine<br />\nfilm<br />\n<br />\nare still backed up against a wall,<br />\nin this case the rear of a bus, and<br />\nthe expressions on their faces reveal an angst to often seen on the<br />\nfaces of college students today.<br />\nBy running off, they have not in<br />\nfact escaped their situation, but<br />\nas they almost immediately realize,<br />\nhave instead run faster and more<br />\ndirectly headlong into it.<br />\nNevertheless, the audience leaves the film happy. It remembers<br />\nthe seductive attractiveness of<br />\nAnne Bancroft, the youthful feminity of Katherine Ross, the charmingly droll actions and lines of<br />\nDustin Hoffman, the satire of the<br />\nBeverly Hills mishagoyim, the<br />\npretty coastal hills of California,<br />\nand perhaps most the pervasive<br />\nhumor sprinkled throughout the<br />\nfilm. In fact, a striking parellel<br />\ncan be made to Arthur Penn's<br />\nBonnie and Clyde which, despite<br />\na frightingly brutal ending, left<br />\nthe viewer with a warm,somewhat<br />\npleased feeling \u2014 as after hearing a<br />\nWoody Guthrie song. This is not<br />\nto say that the audience is pleased<br />\nwith the violence or the killing,<br />\nbut rather that the total film, the<br />\ncharm and humor of the Barrow<br />\ngang, outways the momentary<br />\nshock of the murder at the end.<br />\nThe Graduate succeeds in much<br />\nthe same way \u2014 you do not really<br />\nexpect Ben to get away from that<br />\nmetaphoric wall he has constantly<br />\nbeen backed against, just as you<br />\ndon't expect Bonnie and Clyde to<br />\ncontinue ravaging the countryside<br />\ninto old age.<br />\nIf Nichols and Penn had followed the old Hollywood rules, for<br />\ninstance, Ben and Elaine would<br />\nhave been kissing in the tail of the<br />\nbus, a sunset glowing overhead,<br />\nand Bonnie and Clyde would have<br />\nescaped South o' the border ad<br />\nset up a little sweet potato farm.<br />\nBut such vacuous cridings,no matter how alluring to little old ladies,<br />\nwould not have left you half<br />\nsmiling, half crying, and they<br />\nwould not have made you think<br />\nand question.<br />\nR. C. T.<br />\n<br />\nShow is watching the continuous<br />\nsaga of rightwing middle class man<br />\nreading the New York Daily News.<br />\nPyne not only expounds smallness but defends it. He comes to<br />\nevery show equipped with a small<br />\nbut deadly arsenal of forensic dirty tricks. One weapon is the commercial, which Pyne uses like a<br />\nquarterback uses time-outs in the<br />\nlast minutes of play, stopping the<br />\naction whenever he's in trouble.<br />\nThere is also Pyne's regular audience, a collection of simple, ardent Pyne supporters with whom<br />\nthe folks back home can identify.<br />\nI will say nothing else about the<br />\nloyal Pyne audience other than<br />\nthat Pyne performs a valuable public service by keeping these people<br />\noff the streets at night.<br />\nNarrow though he is, Pyne is<br />\nnot enough. There have been occasions when all Pyne's lack of piety<br />\nand wit could not keep his nose<br />\nfrom being solidly rubbed into<br />\nthe studio floor, thus making life<br />\nuncomfortable for those identifying and supporting him. Such an<br />\noccasion was David Susskind's appearance on the show.

Burke is not the bigot<br />\nnext door but the superior father<br />\nfigure and bastion of strength for<br />\nthe small mind. He says nothing<br />\nbut says it well. He takes on all<br />\ncorners,all threats to smallness and<br />\ndefeats them all mercilessly. The<br />\naudience masochists who face<br />\nBurke have a much better time<br />\nthan they do on the Pyne show<br />\nwhere they are often in danger of<br />\nnot being beaten to sufficiently<br />\nsmall pieces. Pyne is a set of beliefs, Burke is a set of demands.<br />\nBurke is the enforcer of the pettiness laid down by Pyne.<br />\nBurke is also an illustration of<br />\nthe middle class tendency to<br />\nequate egotism and image with<br />\nworth.

McCarthy's decision to<br />\nchallenge the President on one crucial issue marks a new milestone<br />\nin the dissent over the war. For<br />\nthose who have long been unable<br />\nto stomach LBJ's policies, but yet<br />\ncould not bring themselves to don<br />\nbeard and placard, Senator McCarthy's actions represent the first<br />\nlegitimate protest<br />\nmovement<br />\nagainst the war emerge within the<br />\nAmerican political party system.<br />\nThe method McCarthy has chosen<br />\nto advance peace in Vietnam is<br />\ngenuinely unique and profoundly<br />\ncourageous. And for many who<br />\ndisapprove of the war, but still believe in maintaining the system,<br />\nMcCarthy's movement is a popular<br />\none in which to unite.<br />\nPractically speaking, McCarthy<br />\nhas little to gain personally from<br />\nhis actions.

As the Nebraska Democratic State Chairman<br />\nput it, the McCarthy candidacy\"<br />\n. . . could clear the air on this<br />\nVietnam issue and show there is<br />\nvery substantial backing for the<br />\nPresident.\"<br />\nBut that's just the point. On<br />\nthe other hand, while the air is<br />\nbeing cleared on Vietnam, if Sup..<br />\nportfor the McCarthy position<br />\ngrows to the point where backing<br />\nfor LBJ is not so substantial(i.e. if<br />\nMcCarthy defeats Johnson in one<br />\nor more primaries), LBJ just might<br />\ndecide to try the 1952 version of<br />\nTruman and exit gracefully. In<br />\nthat case, McCarthy (as he has suggested himself) would probably<br />\nthrow the ball to Bobby Kennedy<br />\nwho could go on to try for the<br />\nDemocratic nomination amidst a<br />\nsplintered party.<br />\nThis second outcome of the<br />\nMcCarthy movement,though highly hypothetical, takes on some<br />\nvivid realism when the significance<br />\nof the Republican party is considered. With only George Romney formally announced for the<br />\nGOP nomination, there is every<br />\ngood reason for peace-loving Republicans to support McCarthy.<br />\nFirst, with the Democrats split, it<br />\nis logical to assume that bipartisan<br />\nsupport for McCarthy will generate<br />\nthe maximum energy toward deny-<br />\n<br />\nTHE ACID SOUND NOW AVAILABLE<br />\nPhone Don: 235-4461<br />\n<br />\ning Johnson renomination - - maybe even enough to do the trick.<br />\nBut more important, Republicans<br />\nwho favor immediate de-escalation<br />\nand eventual withdrawal from<br />\nVietnam have no guarantee that<br />\nthe man their party will select in<br />\nMiami Beach will strive to end the<br />\nwar. In fact, there is every reason<br />\nto suspect that Nixon or Reagan<br />\nwould carry on the war in larger<br />\ndimensions if elected president.<br />\nDo not misunderstand. This is \u2022<br />\nnot to advocate that Republicans<br />\ndesert their party on the war issue<br />\nin favor of Bobby Kennedy if<br />\nNixon or Reagan get the nod. On<br />\nthe contrary, my point is that if,<br />\nto the surprise of most practical<br />\npoliticians, a definitive popular<br />\nprotest against the Administration's handling of the war can be<br />\nformulated before the GOP convention, then any Republican<br />\nnominee will be strongly pressured<br />\nto call for an immediate end of<br />\nthe war if he expects to win the<br />\nNovember election. In the meantime, Republicans can aid their<br />\nDemocratic rivals in the McCarthy<br />\nmovement against the war, an issue<br />\nmuch too vital to America's security to be confined within party<br />\nboundaries.<br />\nToday Senator McCarthy is the<br />\nsymbol with whom most Americans can identify in condemning<br />\nJohnson's War. He has finally given<br />\nsome respectability and integrity<br />\nto the protest movement by seeking \"an honorable, rational, and<br />\npolitical solution to the war . . .<br />\nwhich will encourage the respect<br />\nof our allies . .. and leave us both<br />\nresources and moral energy to deal<br />\neffectively with the pressing domestie programs of the U.S. itself\". Furthermore, if Defense Secretary McNamara's dismissal is a<br />\nprelude to greater influence of the<br />\ngenerals in escalating the war, then<br />\nthe McCarthy movement may be<br />\noffering more than just an alternative to LBJ; it may be offering<br />\nthe only hope for a change in administrations that will significantly affect U.S. foreign and domestic<br />\npolicies.

That offenseman<br />\nwas Joe Cowan - Hopkins Sportsman of the Year, 1967.<br />\nIt is difficult, if not impossible<br />\nto select the outstanding athlete at<br />\nany college for any year. The presence of such competitors as Jim<br />\nRyun,Lew Alcindor,or O.J. Simpson make the task an easier one.<br />\nThe assignment at Hopkins for<br />\n1967 was perhaps less difficult<br />\nthan it has been for at least two<br />\ndecades.<br />\nFrosh-Standout<br />\nJoseph William Cowan, a 5'<br />\n10\", 175 lb. junior, from Baltimore began his collegiate athletic<br />\ncareer in 1964 in the opening frosh<br />\nfootball game against Franklin and<br />\nMarshall. He returned the opening<br />\nkickoff 69 yards for the touchdown, and finished the game and<br />\nthe season in equally dramatic<br />\nfashion. His efforts on the frosh<br />\nlacrosse team were no less outstanding, and he displayed promise of an excellent varsity career<br />\nin both sports.<br />\nEarly in the football season of<br />\nhis sophomore year, Cowan sustained a back injury which required surgery and kept him out of<br />\nathletics for over a year. Returning to the Hopkins sports scene in<br />\nthe spring of 1967, Joe astounded<br />\nalmost the entire nation with his<br />\nability in lacrosse. Playing varsity<br />\nattack for the victorious Jays,<br />\nCowan received highest accolades<br />\nfrom the Hopkins coaches, who<br />\ntermed him \"the best attackman<br />\nin the country.\" He was high<br />\nscorer in the major College Division, and was named to the First<br />\nTeam All-America and All-State<br />\nselections.<br />\nCowan posted excellent performances in every 1967 lacrosse contest. In the crucial Navy outing,<br />\nhe played with a badly bruised and<br />\npainful thigh, but was still credited<br />\nwith four assists. The Army game<br />\nsaw him gain six assists in what<br />\nwas perhaps the high point of his<br />\nseason.<br />\nKickoff Return Repeated<br />\nAfter a two year absence from<br />\ngrid competition, Joe returned to<br />\nrepeat this freshman performance<br />\nagainst F&M. Again he returned<br />\nthe opening kickoff(88 yards) for<br />\nthe TD. Again he completed the<br />\ngame and the season in equally<br />\noutstanding fashion. Cowan was<br />\nawarded Little All-American, honorable mention honors; and was<br />\nselected as most valuable player in<br />\nboth the Mason-Dixon and Southern Division Middle Atlantic Conferences.<br />\nEstablishing eleven Hopkins records, he led the offense with<br />\nfourteen TD's and the highest<br />\nHopkins rushing average ever, 8.5<br />\n<br />\nJoe Corn<br />\nCowan<br />\nyards per carry. his 29 points<br />\nagainst Haverford was also a new<br />\nschool record. Even in the gridmen's only loss (to RandolphMacon) Cowan copped a long run<br />\nfor a touchdown and a long pass<br />\nto Steve Latson. Throughout the<br />\nseason Joe displayed spectacular<br />\nthrowing, punting, and place kicking ability as well as explosive<br />\nrunning.<br />\nAccording to lacrosse coach<br />\nBob Scott, \"Cowan is probably<br />\nthe most gifted athlete at Hopkins<br />\nin the last 20 years.\" A business<br />\nmajor, who posted a 3.0 academic<br />\naverage last semester, Cowan dedicates himself to being a outstanding athlete.

William Sloan Coffin, Jr., and three others for counseling young men<br />\nto refuse the draft, the Government has again escalated its repression of the anti-war movement. Unable to quash the rising tide of<br />\nopposition to the war with red-baiting and calls for patriotic<br />\nunity, and failing to intimidate dissent with physical violence, as<br />\nexhibited at the Pentagon, the Government has now moved to imprison its opposition. The resort to incarceration is, in itself, highly significant; a government does not jail its opposition unless it<br />\nfeels it to be a real threat to either it or its policies. Yet dissent and<br />\nopposition are the essence of a democracy. If indeed the anti-war<br />\nmovement poses a threat to the Government or its policies, that<br />\nis, it has popular support, the Government's response of imprisonment would- indicate some degree of breakdown of our democracy.<br />\nIf this is the case, one may then legitimately ask where will the<br />\npolitical repression end? The Government's recent action indicates<br />\nits answer to this question, for it has significantly targeted major<br />\nfigures in the anti-war movement who are by no means the most<br />\nextreme and whose \"crime\" is not a major one, even in terms of<br />\nthe Selective Service Act. Indeed, as the Government has already<br />\njailed growing numbers of draft resisters, it is in this context that<br />\nthe recent action of the Government can be termed a serious escalation of political repression with frightening omens for the future.<br /><br />\nDiscover America<br /><br />\nfistE .rse OSA<br />\n1,4 *of<br />\ncnalgoLET<br /><br />\n'Wow 460vr \"TiliZEE WEEKS<br />\nOg THE PEDERNALES ?\"<br /><br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\nTelevision, as McLuhan observed in Understanding Media, is the<br />\nmost participatory of the participatory media. You don't merely<br />\nwatch television, you identify with<br />\nit, you view it as you view your<br />\nown dreams, switching your identity from character to character,<br />\n1 returning to the waking world only<br />\nwhen you switch the thing off.<br />\nAs a consequence of their media's invoking a high level of viewer<br />\nparticipation, the ominous magnates of the popular T.V. empire<br />\narrange their presentations to reflect what normally runs through<br />\ntheir viewer's minds - - the mundane and the fantastic. The situation comedy milieu and the soap<br />\nopera are the bland jokes and the<br />\ntired plots of uncounted millions<br />\nof dreary lives. The action fantasies represent the lowest common<br />\ndenominator of the common futile dreams.<br />\nRecently, however, television's<br />\ngreatest problem has been the<br />\nworld's refusal to be either completely mundane or completely<br />\nfantastic. There was no problem<br />\nduring the \"It's All All Right\"<br />\nEisenhower era. But the news of,<br />\nthe sixties, from the election of an<br />\nintelligent President to the national addiction to a pointless war, has<br />\nbeen a series of spectacular events<br /><br />\nbuilt upon obscure but /essential\"<br />\npatterns of causation. For television to explain the sixties to the<br />\nviewer would mean substituting a<br />\nclassroom for the highly profitable<br />\nmirror erected in front of the little<br />\nblack box. Such a solution is<br />\nknown as extremism. A better<br />\nsolution had to be found and was.<br />\nEnter Joe Pyne and Alan Burke<br />\n(and a host of their imitators) to<br />\nbring to the public the news as<br />\nseen through their own minds.<br />\nBoth men are narrow-minded, egotistical and obnoxious enough to<br />\nmirror perfectly every prejudice<br />\nand idiosyncracy of the lower middle class listening public. Pyne and<br />\nBurke are the Huntley and Brinkley<br />\nof the BBBC (Bigoted Bellicose<br />\nBroadcasting Company), the popular news network.<br />\nPyne is the straight news man.<br />\nThrough him comes all you need<br />\nto know,not in the aloof statistical<br />\nmanner of the 6:00 p.m. news but<br />\nin the candidly simple, blatent<br />\nform of the Bircher next door.<br />\nThe world is polarized into the<br />\ngood and the bad and especially<br />\nthe simple. Complicated issues<br />\nhave simple and obvious bases, or<br />\nelse they simply don't matter.<br />\nPyne's show is the tabloid of the<br />\nair, the review of this week's<br />\nfreakery. Watching the Joe Pyne<br /><br />\nThe Graduate<br /><br />\nComing of Age I<br />\nIt is ironic that Hollywood,<br />\nthat once great film capital of<br />\nthe world which everyone was<br />\nbeginning to feel was beyond rejuvenation, is emerging as a slightly<br />\nlagging leader, this time by abandoning the archaic Hollywood<br />\nrules of cinematography<br />\nThe Hollywood rules ran the<br />\nfilm industry and built it into a<br />\ncolossus. But,like all great edifices,<br />\nit was bound to eventually fall<br />\nunder its own weight, only to be<br />\nreplaced by sleeker, more natural<br />\nand less cumbersome conventions.<br />\nParadoxically, the elimination of<br />\nthe tried and tested rules freed the<br />\nindustry from the confinement of<br />\nthe studio,enabled less established<br />\ndirectors to try their often more<br />\ncreative hands, and encouraged<br />\ncameramen to experiment with<br />\nnew techniques unheard of in the<br />\ngolden age of massive dollies and<br />\ntwo ton cameras.<br />\nThe change, of course, was<br />\nprodded by the rising popularity<br />\nand, therefore, box office draw,<br />\nof the Europeans beginning in the<br />\nlate fifties. Resnais' Last Year at<br />\nMarienbad and Fellini's Dolce Vita<br />\nopened many American eyes to<br />\nthe cinematic advantages of facial<br />\nmontages, hand-held cameras, offscreen narration, time-lapse sequences, fast cutting and irregular<br />\nsplicing.<br />\nAll of these previously antiHollywood techniques have been<br />\npresent in the latest batch of<br />\nHollywood products -- Cool Hand<br />\nLuke, In the Heat of the Night,<br />\nGames, Bonnie and Clyde, and<br />\nmost recently The Graduate. Mike<br />\nNichols, who also directed Virginia<br />\nWolff, has produced in The Graduate what is probably the finest<br />\nAmerican film of the year. With<br />\nas keen a feeling for humor as for<br />\npathos as for sensitivity, Nichols<br />\ncarries his audience from one<br />\nmood to another, cutting at precisely the right time, feeling the<br />\nthen<br />\n\"m\"<br />\ntensions, heightening tke<br />\niumor<br />\nsmoothing them out<br />\nand satire.<br />\nIt is not, in retrospect, a happy<br />\nin the end, Ben and Elaine<br />\nfilm<br /><br />\nare still backed up against a wall,<br />\nin this case the rear of a bus, and<br />\nthe expressions on their faces reveal an angst to often seen on the<br />\nfaces of college students today.<br />\nBy running off, they have not in<br />\nfact escaped their situation, but<br />\nas they almost immediately realize,<br />\nhave instead run faster and more<br />\ndirectly headlong into it.<br />\nNevertheless, the audience leaves the film happy. It remembers<br />\nthe seductive attractiveness of<br />\nAnne Bancroft, the youthful feminity of Katherine Ross, the charmingly droll actions and lines of<br />\nDustin Hoffman, the satire of the<br />\nBeverly Hills mishagoyim, the<br />\npretty coastal hills of California,<br />\nand perhaps most the pervasive<br />\nhumor sprinkled throughout the<br />\nfilm. In fact, a striking parellel<br />\ncan be made to Arthur Penn's<br />\nBonnie and Clyde which, despite<br />\na frightingly brutal ending, left<br />\nthe viewer with a warm,somewhat<br />\npleased feeling \u2014 as after hearing a<br />\nWoody Guthrie song. This is not<br />\nto say that the audience is pleased<br />\nwith the violence or the killing,<br />\nbut rather that the total film, the<br />\ncharm and humor of the Barrow<br />\ngang, outways the momentary<br />\nshock of the murder at the end.<br />\nThe Graduate succeeds in much<br />\nthe same way \u2014 you do not really<br />\nexpect Ben to get away from that<br />\nmetaphoric wall he has constantly<br />\nbeen backed against, just as you<br />\ndon't expect Bonnie and Clyde to<br />\ncontinue ravaging the countryside<br />\ninto old age.<br />\nIf Nichols and Penn had followed the old Hollywood rules, for<br />\ninstance, Ben and Elaine would<br />\nhave been kissing in the tail of the<br />\nbus, a sunset glowing overhead,<br />\nand Bonnie and Clyde would have<br />\nescaped South o' the border ad<br />\nset up a little sweet potato farm.<br />\nBut such vacuous cridings,no matter how alluring to little old ladies,<br />\nwould not have left you half<br />\nsmiling, half crying, and they<br />\nwould not have made you think<br />\nand question.<br />\nR.

One weapon is the commercial, which Pyne uses like a<br />\nquarterback uses time-outs in the<br />\nlast minutes of play, stopping the<br />\naction whenever he's in trouble.<br />\nThere is also Pyne's regular audience, a collection of simple, ardent Pyne supporters with whom<br />\nthe folks back home can identify.<br />\nI will say nothing else about the<br />\nloyal Pyne audience other than<br />\nthat Pyne performs a valuable public service by keeping these people<br />\noff the streets at night.<br />\nNarrow though he is, Pyne is<br />\nnot enough. There have been occasions when all Pyne's lack of piety<br />\nand wit could not keep his nose<br />\nfrom being solidly rubbed into<br />\nthe studio floor, thus making life<br />\nuncomfortable for those identifying and supporting him. Such an<br />\noccasion was David Susskind's appearance on the show.

He takes on all<br />\ncorners,all threats to smallness and<br />\ndefeats them all mercilessly.

Any<br /><br />\n[Republican Bias<br /><br />\n17te Democrats<br /><br />\nBy KENNETH W. BOND<br />\nLast week<br />\nSenator Eugene<br />\nMcCarthy (D. Minn.,) stated that<br />\n\"recent announcements from the<br />\nAdministration of plans for continued escalation and intensification of the war... and the absence<br />\nof any positive indication or suggestion for a negotiated political<br />\nsettlement\" had made him decide<br />\nto oppose President Johnson in<br />\nfour upcoming Democratic primaries. McCarthy's decision to<br />\nchallenge the President on one crucial issue marks a new milestone<br />\nin the dissent over the war. For<br />\nthose who have long been unable<br />\nto stomach LBJ's policies, but yet<br />\ncould not bring themselves to don<br />\nbeard and placard, Senator McCarthy's actions represent the first<br />\nlegitimate protest<br />\nmovement<br />\nagainst the war emerge within the<br />\nAmerican political party system.<br />\nThe method McCarthy has chosen<br />\nto advance peace in Vietnam is<br />\ngenuinely unique and profoundly<br />\ncourageous. And for many who<br />\ndisapprove of the war, but still believe in maintaining the system,<br />\nMcCarthy's movement is a popular<br />\none in which to unite.<br />\nPractically speaking, McCarthy<br />\nhas little to gain personally from<br />\nhis actions. On one hand, if his<br />\nsupport comes to little or nothing,<br />\nLBJ can cast himself in the mold<br />\nof Harry Truman a la 1948, adjust<br />\nhis Vietnam policies accordingly,<br />\nand become \"give 'em hell Lyndon\" next November, regardless<br /><br />\nof the war's status between now<br />\nand then. This outcome of the<br />\nMcCarthy movement seems to be<br />\nthe current popular opinion among<br />\nDemocratic leaders. As the Nebraska Democratic State Chairman<br />\nput it, the McCarthy candidacy\"<br />\n. . . could clear the air on this<br />\nVietnam issue and show there is<br />\nvery substantial backing for the<br />\nPresident.\"<br />\nBut that's just the point. On<br />\nthe other hand, while the air is<br />\nbeing cleared on Vietnam, if Sup..<br />\nportfor the McCarthy position<br />\ngrows to the point where backing<br />\nfor LBJ is not so substantial(i.e. if<br />\nMcCarthy defeats Johnson in one<br />\nor more primaries), LBJ just might<br />\ndecide to try the 1952 version of<br />\nTruman and exit gracefully. In<br />\nthat case, McCarthy (as he has suggested himself) would probably<br />\nthrow the ball to Bobby Kennedy<br />\nwho could go on to try for the<br />\nDemocratic nomination amidst a<br />\nsplintered party.<br />\nThis second outcome of the<br />\nMcCarthy movement,though highly hypothetical, takes on some<br />\nvivid realism when the significance<br />\nof the Republican party is considered. With only George Romney formally announced for the<br />\nGOP nomination, there is every<br />\ngood reason for peace-loving Republicans to support McCarthy.<br />\nFirst, with the Democrats split, it<br />\nis logical to assume that bipartisan<br />\nsupport for McCarthy will generate<br />\nthe maximum energy toward deny-<br /><br />\nTHE ACID SOUND NOW AVAILABLE<br />\nPhone Don: 235-4461<br /><br />\ning Johnson renomination - - maybe even enough to do the trick.<br />\nBut more important, Republicans<br />\nwho favor immediate de-escalation<br />\nand eventual withdrawal from<br />\nVietnam have no guarantee that<br />\nthe man their party will select in<br />\nMiami Beach will strive to end the<br />\nwar. In fact, there is every reason<br />\nto suspect that Nixon or Reagan<br />\nwould carry on the war in larger<br />\ndimensions if elected president.<br />\nDo not misunderstand. This is \u2022<br />\nnot to advocate that Republicans<br />\ndesert their party on the war issue<br />\nin favor of Bobby Kennedy if<br />\nNixon or Reagan get the nod. On<br />\nthe contrary, my point is that if,<br />\nto the surprise of most practical<br />\npoliticians, a definitive popular<br />\nprotest against the Administration's handling of the war can be<br />\nformulated before the GOP convention, then any Republican<br />\nnominee will be strongly pressured<br />\nto call for an immediate end of<br />\nthe war if he expects to win the<br />\nNovember election. In the meantime, Republicans can aid their<br />\nDemocratic rivals in the McCarthy<br />\nmovement against the war, an issue<br />\nmuch too vital to America's security to be confined within party<br />\nboundaries.<br />\nToday Senator McCarthy is the<br />\nsymbol with whom most Americans can identify in condemning<br />\nJohnson's War. He has finally given<br />\nsome respectability and integrity<br />\nto the protest movement by seeking \"an honorable, rational, and<br />\npolitical solution to the war . . .<br />\nwhich will encourage the respect<br />\nof our allies . .. and leave us both<br />\nresources and moral energy to deal<br />\neffectively with the pressing domestie programs of the U.S. itself\". Furthermore, if Defense Secretary McNamara's dismissal is a<br />\nprelude to greater influence of the<br />\ngenerals in escalating the war, then<br />\nthe McCarthy movement may be<br />\noffering more than just an alternative to LBJ; it may be offering<br />\nthe only hope for a change in administrations that will significantly affect U.S. foreign and domestic<br />\npolicies.

Simpson make the task an easier one.<br />\nThe assignment at Hopkins for<br />\n1967 was perhaps less difficult<br />\nthan it has been for at least two<br />\ndecades.<br />\nFrosh-Standout<br />\nJoseph William Cowan, a 5'<br />\n10\", 175 lb. junior, from Baltimore began his collegiate athletic<br />\ncareer in 1964 in the opening frosh<br />\nfootball game against Franklin and<br />\nMarshall. He returned the opening<br />\nkickoff 69 yards for the touchdown, and finished the game and<br />\nthe season in equally dramatic<br />\nfashion. His efforts on the frosh<br />\nlacrosse team were no less outstanding, and he displayed promise of an excellent varsity career<br />\nin both sports.<br />\nEarly in the football season of<br />\nhis sophomore year, Cowan sustained a back injury which required surgery and kept him out of<br />\nathletics for over a year. Returning to the Hopkins sports scene in<br />\nthe spring of 1967, Joe astounded<br />\nalmost the entire nation with his<br />\nability in lacrosse. Playing varsity<br />\nattack for the victorious Jays,<br />\nCowan received highest accolades<br />\nfrom the Hopkins coaches, who<br />\ntermed him \"the best attackman<br />\nin the country.\" He was high<br />\nscorer in the major College Division, and was named to the First<br />\nTeam All-America and All-State<br />\nselections.<br />\nCowan posted excellent performances in every 1967 lacrosse contest. In the crucial Navy outing,<br />\nhe played with a badly bruised and<br />\npainful thigh, but was still credited<br />\nwith four assists. The Army game<br />\nsaw him gain six assists in what<br />\nwas perhaps the high point of his<br />\nseason.<br />\nKickoff Return Repeated<br />\nAfter a two year absence from<br />\ngrid competition, Joe returned to<br />\nrepeat this freshman performance<br />\nagainst F&amp;M. Again he returned<br />\nthe opening kickoff(88 yards) for<br />\nthe TD. Again he completed the<br />\ngame and the season in equally<br />\noutstanding fashion. Cowan was<br />\nawarded Little All-American, honorable mention honors; and was<br />\nselected as most valuable player in<br />\nboth the Mason-Dixon and Southern Division Middle Atlantic Conferences.<br />\nEstablishing eleven Hopkins records, he led the offense with<br />\nfourteen TD's and the highest<br />\nHopkins rushing average ever, 8.5<br /><br />\nJoe Corn<br />\nCowan<br />\nyards per carry. his 29 points<br />\nagainst Haverford was also a new<br />\nschool record. Even in the gridmen's only loss (to RandolphMacon) Cowan copped a long run<br />\nfor a touchdown and a long pass<br />\nto Steve Latson. Throughout the<br />\nseason Joe displayed spectacular<br />\nthrowing, punting, and place kicking ability as well as explosive<br />\nrunning.<br />\nAccording to lacrosse coach<br />\nBob Scott, \"Cowan is probably<br />\nthe most gifted athlete at Hopkins<br />\nin the last 20 years.\" A business<br />\nmajor, who posted a 3.0 academic<br />\naverage last semester, Cowan dedicates himself to being a outstanding athlete.
