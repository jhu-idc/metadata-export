Apart<br />\nfrom the violence directed<br />\nagainst the U.S., other nations<br />\nhave fallen victim to terrorist<br />\nattacks.<br />\nRecent international incidents include the bombings of<br />\nHarrod's Department Store in<br />\nLondon and Orly Airport in<br />\nParis.

He described<br />\nGhandi's death as the consequence of inside terrorism,<br />\nresulting from the conflict between the Sikhs and the Hindus.<br />\nOakley named the Middle<br />\nEast, especially Iran and Libya,<br />\nas the prominent source of<br />\nworld wide terrorism. Those<br />\ncountries are responsible for the<br />\nmajority of incidents against<br />\nthe U.S., Great Britain, Zaire,<br />\nSudan, and France. He described the terrorism in South<br />\nAmerica as a combined threat<br />\nof violence and narcotics.<br />\n\"There have been terrorism<br />\nfailures as well as successes,\"<br />\ncontinued Oakley. The vigilance of U.S. agencies, like the<br />\nFBI, has resulted in the identification of terrorists and unsuccessful assasination attempts. One example was the<br />\nthwarting of the assassination<br />\nattempt on the president of<br />\nHonduras. His would-be<br />\nassailants were imprisoned for<br />\ntheir cocaine dealing.<br />\nOakley said that terrorists<br />\ngain knowledge and information from talk about antiterrorist measures. This is the<br />\n<br />\nchief reason why so many of<br />\nmeasures remain<br />\nthese<br />\nclassified.<br />\nA leak in the U.S. government was responsible for the<br />\nrevelation of Italy's terrorist arrests. The Italian police were<br />\nangered by this disclosure<br />\nbecause their investigation had<br />\nnot been completed. They arrested seven Arabs, belonging,<br />\nto a ring of terrorists who had<br />\nplans to penetrate the U.S. Embasy in Rome. \"Excellent<br />\npolice work and courageous<br />\nleadership at the top are<br />\nresponsible for the suppression<br />\nof terrorism in Italy and worldwide,\" said Oakley.<br />\nHe continued that terrorists<br />\nhave a program of action in<br />\n'mind. They are not loners, as<br />\nonce believed. Their kamikaze<br />\nmissions, such as suicide bombings, are regarded by some<br />\ncultures as heroic,<br />\nOakley then addressed the<br />\nissue of counterterrorism and<br />\nprevention. The efforts to<br />\ncounteract terrorism include<br />\nnew legislation concerning hijacking, additional funds, and<br />\nthe investigation of new techniques to improve physical security for missions.<br />\nA source of controversy is<br />\nthe need for violence in certain<br />\ninstances to apprehend terrorists. Oakley said that the<br />\nsuccessful raid by Italian police<br />\n<br />\nis a model example of prevention<br />\nwithout<br />\nviolence.<br />\nHowever, groups that are<br />\nfanatic, well-trained, and heavily armed cannot always be stopped without violence.<br />\nSchultz believes that all U.S.<br />\ncounteractions are in selfdefense and not vengeance<br />\nagainst these organizations.<br />\nThe preferred course is to avoid<br />\nviolence. These measures indude prohibiting the export of<br />\nweapons and high technology<br />\nto countries known to advocate<br />\nterrorism. U.S. citizens are advised not to travel to these<br />\ncountries.<br />\nInternational conventions on<br />\nhijacking are examples of<br />\nworld-wide cooperation in<br />\ncombatting terrorism. In<br />\nregards to U.S. relations with<br />\nother countries, Oakley said,<br />\n\"It is important to teach them,<br />\nlearn from them, and establish<br />\ncontacts.\"<br />\nOne student from the audience asked why the U.S. cornbats terrorism world-wide and<br />\nthen supports terrorist activities<br />\nin South America. Oakley<br />\nresponded that there is a difference between insurgencies or<br />\nguerilla warfare, and terrorism.<br />\nOne targets the military and the<br />\nother victimizes civilians. He<br />\nsaid that the U.S. does not consider the insurgents in South<br />\nAmerica to be terrorists.<br />\n<br />\nLarry Volz<br />\n<br />\nAmbassador Robert Oakley who delivered the last speech of the M.S.E.<br />\nSymposium this year.

Mental health experts attribute this<br />\ndevelopment to several factors, including the<br />\nincreasingly competitive job market and the<br />\npressure to earn \"marketable\" degrees felt<br />\nby undergraduates today. The everincreasing cost of education and the desire<br />\nto fulfill personal and parental expectations<br />\nlikewise contribute to the stress experienced by students.<br />\nUndergraduates at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity are undoubtedly subjected to<br />\nthese tensions, as well as to a significant<br />\namount of pre-professional intensity.<br />\nCourses designed to \"weed out\" students,<br />\nlong study hours and professional school application processes serve only to augment an<br />\nalready high level of anxiety.<br />\nIt is essential that something be done to<br />\nalleviate this strain, particularly during the<br />\nfall semester, when students must endure the<br />\nacademic workload until the Thanksgiving<br />\nholiday without interruption. Students at the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia demanded that a twoday fall break be implemented at their school<br />\n<br />\nafter several of their classmates took their<br />\nown lives. According to one undergraduate,<br />\n\"The work is just nonstop. We need a day<br />\nor two off in a span of 11 weeks. Otherwise,<br />\nwho wouldn't freak out?\"<br />\nThe idea for a fall break is a sound one<br />\nand deserves serious consideration at Johns<br />\nHopkins. Unfortunately, altering the<br />\nacademic calendar at any university is a difficult, if not impossible, task. The schedule<br />\nmust satisfy the administration, the faculty<br />\nand the unions. Undergraduates do not have<br />\na great deal of priority in determining the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nAn exception should be made in this case,<br />\nhowever, since it directly involves the mental and emotional well-being of a significant<br />\nproportion of the university population.<br />\nMental health professionals, as well as<br />\nstatistical tables, support this view. Concerned Hopkins students are currently in the process of attempting to persuade the administration of the necessity of a fall holiday.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University is entirely<br />\ncapable of developing a calendar which<br />\nwould accomodate a fall interim. The question is, what will it take to convince them?<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nTaking Precautions<br />\nTo The Editor:<br />\n<br />\nVery recently, I went to the<br />\nbookstore and placed my<br />\nbackpack in a locker, as I had<br />\ndone a hundred times before.<br />\nOnly this time, when I came<br />\nout, my bag was nowhere to be<br />\nfound. The first things that<br />\nentered my mind were,\"maybe<br />\nsomeone moved it to a different<br />\nlocker\" and \"maybe someone<br />\npicked it up accidentally, thinking it was theirs.\" After some<br />\ninvestigation, I decided that it<br />\nhad been stolen. I'm sure that<br />\nI'm neither the first nor the last<br />\nperson to which this has happened, probably because we tell<br />\nourselves that another Hopkins<br />\nstudent wouldn't steal from us.<br />\nThis may be true, but we must<br />\nremember that our campus is<br />\nlocated in a large city and is<br />\ngenerally open to all. Unfortunately, it took something<br />\nhappening to me for me to<br />\nrealize it. Last year, as a<br />\nfreshman, I only began locking<br />\nmy door all the time after a<br />\nfriend of mine had had his<br />\nstereo taken. It always seems to<br />\ntake a personal experience to<br />\nmake us aware, which is usually too late.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that a situation exists in which precautions<br />\nsuch as locking our possessions<br />\naway are necessary, but we all<br />\nknew that we'd be living in<br />\nBaltimore when we chose Johns<br />\nHopkins. I'm simply saying<br />\nthat the extra few seconds it<br />\n<br />\ntakes to lock your door before<br />\ngoing to dinner or to lock that<br />\nlocker before going into the<br />\nbookstore are definitely worth<br />\nit. You can bet the house, the<br />\ncar, and whatever's behind<br />\ndoor number three that I won't<br />\nleave my property unprotected<br />\nagain. I was pretty lucky. All I<br />\nlost was my calculator (Security found the bag with<br />\neverything else intact).

Quinn; Library of<br />\nAmerica; 1408 pp., $27.50.<br />\nPoe: Poetry and Tales, one<br />\nof the three new additions to<br />\nthe Library of America's handsome series of the collected<br />\nworks of great American<br />\nwriters, is a bonanza for any<br />\naficionado of Baltimore's most<br />\nfamous story-teller, Edgar<br />\nAllan Poe. In it are all the standard masterpieces of intrigue<br />\nand Gothic horror that earned<br />\nPoe his reputation, plus a<br />\ngoldmine of rarely published,<br />\nlittle known stories, poems, and<br />\narticles that will keep a Poe<br />\nbuff entranced indefinitely.<br />\nThe real merit of this newest<br />\npublication of Poe's work is its<br />\ncomprehensiveness. Patrick F.<br />\nQuinn, who compiled and<br />\nedited the works appearing in<br />\nthe volume, has taken great<br />\ncare to reproduce all of Poe's<br />\nsurviving tales, poems, and<br />\nnovels in chronological order.<br />\nIn this way, the volume allows<br />\nPoe's literary achievement to be<br />\nviewed within the context of his<br />\nmaturation and development as<br />\na writer.<br />\nThe volume is divided into<br />\nthree parts: poetry, tales and<br />\nsketches, and novels. The first<br />\nsection begins with poems that<br />\nPoe describes in his preface as<br />\nbeing \"written in the year<br />\n1821-2, when the author had<br />\nnot completed his fourteenth<br />\nyear. They were of course not<br />\nintended for publication; why<br />\nthey are now published concerns no one but himself..<br />\nThey were written by one \"too<br />\n<br />\nyoung to have any knowledge<br />\nof the world but from his own<br />\nbreast.\"<br />\nMost of these early poems<br />\nconcern conventional subjects<br />\nof poetry like love and<br />\nromance. Yet, even some of the<br />\nearliest, like \"Spirits of the<br />\nDead\" and \"Dreams,\"<br />\nforeshadow Poe's later fascination with subjects of horror.<br />\nThe chronological presentation<br />\nof the sixty-three poems clearly shows his progression<br />\ntowards the fantastic and traces<br />\nthe development of his poetry<br />\nfrom adolescence to maturity.<br />\nIn the second section of the<br />\nvolume are all seventy-two of<br />\nPoe's short prose fictional<br />\nworks and several articles. The<br />\nsection starts with relatively<br />\nunknown sketches like \"The<br />\nDuc de L'Omelette,\" in which<br />\nPoe writes nearly as much in<br />\nFrench as in English. As the<br />\ndevelopment of his writing continues, he rapidly begins to produce the stories of the bizarre<br />\nthat have become his hallmark.<br />\nThese include \"Ligeia\" (the<br />\nstory he later called \"my best<br />\ntale\"), \"The Fall of the House<br />\nof Usher,\" \"William Wilson,\"<br />\n\"The Murders in the Rue<br />\nMorgue,\" \"The Tell-Tale<br />\nHeart,\" and all the other classic<br />\nwell-known (and some not so<br />\nwell-known) stories for which<br />\nhe became famous.<br />\nCharacteristic of his gothic<br />\nstyle is the following passage:<br />\nUnreal!\u2014Even while I breathed<br />\nthere came to my nostrils the breath<br />\nof the vapor of heated iron!

As we approached the anatomy labs, the<br />\ntour guide paused to repeat his<br />\ncall for questions. The guy<br />\nstanding next to me,soon to be<br />\na graduate of one of the major<br />\neast-coast establishments of<br />\nhigher learning (I'll leave it at<br />\nthat) cleared his throat and asked \"Do you get the 'Odd Couple' around here?\" No joke,<br />\nthat's what he asked. Returning<br />\nto my own major east-coast<br />\nestablishment, I recounted this<br />\nepisode to some friends, who<br />\nhad a good laugh, thanked God<br />\nthey came to Johns Hopkins,<br />\nand excused themselves to go<br />\nwatch \"Mash.\"<br />\nThere's something about a<br />\nshow like \"The Odd Couple.\"<br />\nNot only did it run on television<br />\nfor nine years, but you can flip<br />\nit on, say \"I remember this<br />\none,\" tell the person next to<br />\nyou how it ends, and watch it<br />\nanyway.<br />\nThe typical theatergoer<br />\ntherefore approaches Neil<br />\nSimon's new, female version of<br />\n\"The Odd Couple\" with both<br />\nskepticism and expectation.<br />\nThe big question is, \"What's<br />\nthe point?\" Even assuming it's<br />\nnot just a gimmick, can the play<br />\nsucceed where television's<br />\ntragic attempt at an all-black<br />\n\"Odd Couple\" failed? Mr.<br />\nSimon, who claims the script<br />\nused in 1964 is \"about seventyfive percent rewritten\" for its<br />\nBroadway debut this February,<br />\nis hopeful.<br />\nUnfortunately, Mr. Simon<br />\nhas not rewritten enough. The<br />\nmajority of the changes appear<br />\nto be in the names of the<br />\ncharacters. Instead of Felix and<br />\nOscar, we have Florence and<br />\nOlive. They still get together<br />\nwith friends to play poker on<br />\nFriday night. Florence (Sally<br />\nStruthers) is still a compulsively neat hypochondriac, while<br />\nOlive (Rita Moreno) is a slob.<br />\nAlmost all of the one-liners<br />\nthat form the backbone of the<br />\nplay remain unchanged. Olive<br />\noffers her friends green sandwiches which are either \"very<br />\nnew cheese or very old meat.\"<br />\nAs one friend observes, \"Her<br />\nrefrigerator's been broken for<br />\ntwo weeks. I saw milk standing<br />\nin there that wasn't even in the<br />\nbottle.\" At his best, Mr. Simon<br />\nuses such one-liners as the basic<br />\nbuilding blocks of a story; at his<br />\nworst, he scrapes laughs off the<br />\nbottom of the barrel.<br />\nThe play ultimately fails<br />\nbecause it refuses to recognize<br />\nthat relationships between men<br />\nand relationships between<br />\nwomen are different. When<br />\nFelix stayed home all day,<br />\ncleaned the ashtrays, and loved to cook, it was original;<br />\nwhen Florence does it, she appears to be no more than a<br />\nstereotypical housewife who's<br />\nafraid to leave her husband and<br />\ngo into the world. Similarly,<br />\nwhile Oscar was an overweight<br />\n<br />\nslob; Ms. Moreno's Olive is the<br />\nquite attractive producer of a 6<br />\np.m. newscast.<br />\nDirector Danny Simon<br />\n(Neil's older brother) has<br />\nchosen to emphasize the playful<br />\naspects of the script, and while<br />\nthis makes for a lot of laughs,<br />\nit eliminates the darker side of<br />\nthe play. As Walter Kerr has<br />\nwritten, \"Those two men<br />\nhaven't learned anything from<br />\ntheir marital quarrels that will<br />\nhelp them share an apartment<br />\nnow, and they aren't going to<br />\nlearn anything from their quarrels now that will help them<br />\nnext time around...They aren't<br />\ngoing anywhere, except to new<br />\nfailures.\" When Olive chases<br />\nFlorence around the couch, we<br />\nlaugh but are disappointed.<br />\nThe scene that Mr. Simon<br />\n<br />\nhas completely rewritten is<br />\nmarvelous. In place of the<br />\ndouble-date with Cecily and<br />\nGwen Pigeon from England,<br />\nthe women go out with<br />\nManuolo and Jesus Costazuela<br />\nTony<br />\n(Lewis<br />\nStadlen,<br />\nShalhoub) from Barcelona,<br />\nwho have extreme difficulty<br />\nwith the English language. Our<br />\nfaith in 1984's Neil Simon is<br />\nreaffirmed, if only briefly in the<br />\nmiddle of the second act. \"The<br />\nOdd Couple\" will be at the<br />\nMechanic through December 1.<br />\nSee it if you want a light, if unsubstantial, laugh.

The hoopsters will play<br />\nan 18-game schedule including<br />\ntwo games against each of the<br />\nother five division teams:<br />\nFranklin and Marshall,<br />\nWestern Maryland, Lebanon<br />\nValley, Gettysburg, and<br />\nDickinson. Fowler-Dressler expects the Jays' main competition for the top spot to be the<br />\nlatter two and especially<br />\nDickinson, which is ranked nationally in Division III.<br />\n\"We're looking forward to<br />\nthe season, the team is real<br />\npositive and willing to work,\"<br />\nsaid the coach. \"We're going to<br />\nbe good, but the pressure is<br />\non\u2014we have a lot more work<br />\nto do.\"<br />\n<br />\nfor the first time as Bill Nolan<br />\nat 177 and Mike Barnum at 190<br />\npicked up forfeits to put the<br />\nJays in front 23-19.

It was the second<br />\npin in a row for Tristani against<br />\nCoppin State's 320-pound<br />\nwrestler.<br />\nHopkins coach Andy Janquitto was pleased with the entire team's performance. \"I<br />\nthought everybody wrestled a<br />\ngood match, even the guys who<br />\nlost looked good,\" he said.<br />\n\"You never like to win a match<br />\non forfeits, but they forfeited to<br />\nBill Nolan and Mike Barnum,<br />\nwho are two of the better<br />\nwrestlers and who probably<br />\nwould have won anyway.

The<br />\none fright of the meet came<br />\nwhen diving captain Nancy<br />\nRobbins suffered a concussion<br />\nfrom hitting her head performing her last optional, a back one<br />\nand a half. Nancy, who is<br />\n<br />\nrecovering, is eager to resume<br />\ndiving and only regrets that<br />\n\"they didn't score my last<br />\ndive.\"<br />\nSuch an event shook all<br />\nmembers of the team. Jean<br />\nSchroeder, who swam the<br />\nbreastroke right after Robbins<br />\nwas taken to the hospital, said,<br />\n\"I kept seeing flashbacks of<br />\nNancy hitting her head on the<br />\nboard during the race.\" Nevertheless, Schroeder finished her<br />\n200 event, with a time of<br />\n3:19.67.<br />\nThe Jay men remained<br />\nundefeated with an easy 67-45<br />\nwin over the Devils.

Having played her<br />\nfreshman and sophomore years<br />\nat Hopkins, she gained the<br />\nnumber 4 spot two years ago,<br />\nand has shown consistency and<br />\npromise in practice thus far.<br />\nAlso responsible for the<br />\nteam's improved prospects is<br />\nthe number one player for three<br />\nyears and captain for two,<br />\nsenior Jessie Chai. Coming off<br />\nan impressive field hockey<br />\n<br />\nseason, Coach Goodyear<br />\ndescribes her as being \"in excellent shape, more mature,<br />\nconscientious, and with more<br />\nsavvy.\"<br />\nConcerned as well with the<br />\nentire team, Captain Chai concurs with the coach about the<br />\ntroupe's chances of enhancing<br />\nlast year's 2-4 dual meet record.<br />\nShe, too, cites the increased<br />\ndepth of the squad.<br />\nCoach Goodyear hopes the<br />\ngroup will attain a .500 record<br />\nin this season's dual meets. At<br />\nthe 1984 Howe Cup Tournament at Yale University, the<br />\nLady Jays finished a strong<br />\nfourth out of seven teams in<br />\ntheir division. This year, says<br />\nthe coach, they should do even<br />\nbetter.<br />\nThose who played at Yale<br />\nand are returning this season<br />\nare seniors Mary Voytko, a<br />\nnotable powerhouse; Tammy<br />\nHuck; and Josephine Mei.<br />\nOther returnees from the<br />\n1983-84 fleet are sophomore<br />\nCharlotte Seydel, who participated in the 1984 Penn<br />\nRound Robin Tournament;<br />\njunior Ilga Celmins; and<br />\nsophomore Suzanne Stamatov.<br />\n- The two beginners on the team,<br />\nboth freshmen, are Marlene<br />\nSchwaeber and Beth Yip, who<br />\nare progressing well.<br />\nThe squash schedule for this<br />\nseason is much like last year's.<br />\nDue to the small number of<br />\nschools in the area which have<br />\nteams, Hopkins is limited to<br />\nplaying two dual meets each<br />\n<br />\n(one at home, one away)<br />\nagainst Swarthmore and<br />\nFranklin & Marshall. The<br />\nbrigade will again compete in<br />\nthe prestigious Howe Cup<br />\nTournament at Yale and the<br />\nPenn Round Robin at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania in<br />\nPhiladelphia. This latter event,<br />\nwhich is held on Saturday,<br />\nFebruary 16, is preceded on Friday night by two dual matches<br />\nagainst Cornell and Penn at the<br />\nsame locale.<br />\nAn added attraction is<br />\ntonight's Baltimore City Open<br />\nTournament, in which five of<br />\nthe team's top players will battle local squashers in area clubs.<br />\n<br />\nIf they fare well this evening,<br />\nindividual players will proceed<br />\nto advanced rounds of the<br />\ntourney on Saturday and<br />\nperhaps Sunday.<br />\nSpectators are urged to attend the free home matches<br />\nwith Swarthmore and Franklin<br />\n& Marshall on Friday, January<br />\n25 at 4:00 p.m. and Tuesday,<br />\nFebruary 19 at 6:00 p.m.,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nFinally, Coach Goodyear<br />\nhad this to say about his expectations for the team this year,<br />\nexemplifying his tough, yet simple, optimistic attitude: \"They<br />\ncame to play the game.\"<br />\n<br />\nThis past weekend the Three<br />\non Three Basketball Tournament was held and a team from<br />\nDU won the overall title as well<br />\nas the Fraternity Championship, while teams from Phi Psi<br />\nfinished 2nd and 3rd.

T21<br />\nCentralia, WA 98531<br />\n<br />\nby Mike Silverman<br />\nPlagued by poor free-throw<br />\nshooting and a lack of strong<br />\nrebounding, the Hopkins<br />\nbasketball team found the going rough early in the year, losing its first two games of the<br />\nseason. In their home opener<br />\non November 17, the Blue Jays<br />\nwere defeated by a stubborn<br />\nMary Washington Squad,<br />\n65-61. The Jays found even<br />\nmore problems on the road, as<br />\nthey were dealt a 92-66 loss at<br />\nthe hands of a tough Gettysburg team on November 20.<br />\nWeakness at the foul line,<br />\nand a strong second half surge<br />\nby Mary Washington, led to<br />\nHopkins' initial defeat. The<br />\nJays led the Rebels 30-19 at<br />\nhalftime, and increased that<br />\nlead to seventeen points later in<br />\nthe second half, but a four<br />\nminute stretch in which the offense could not score caused the<br />\nlead to evaporate. Following a<br />\ntechnical foul called on forward<br />\nSteve Mitchell, Mary Washington guard Warner Dyke canned three free throws and connected on a 15 foot jumper to<br />\nnarrow the Hopkins lead to<br />\n45-41.<br />\n\"After they got the five<br />\nstraight points on the technical<br />\nand foul, and we couldn't con-<br />\n<br />\nJunior Mike Sohr<br />\n<br />\nvert at the other end of the<br />\ncourt, the momentum switched<br />\nto their favor,\" said Hopkins<br />\nCoach Ed Doherty.<br />\nBy out-rebounding Hopkins<br />\nand converting on critical free<br />\nthrow attempts, Mary Washington eventually took a 52-49<br />\nlead, which it never relinquished.

Plagued by dismal<br />\nshooting, the Jays fell 61-50.<br />\nThe hoopsters managed to<br />\nconnect on just 31 percent of<br />\ntheir shots, while also being<br />\nout-rebounded. Freshman<br />\nguard Phil Dineur led the squad<br />\nwith 16 points, and newcomer<br />\njunior Kevin Sottak ripped<br />\ndown 14 rebounds.<br />\nThe Jays will look to bounce<br />\nback from their rocky start this<br />\nweek with four consecutive<br />\nroad games. Hopkins has<br />\nscheduled contests against Penn<br />\nState-York, Dundalk Community College, Camp Hill,<br />\nand a rematch with Frederick.<br />\nTheir next home game is one<br />\nweek from today, when the<br />\nJays host Penn State-Ogontz at<br />\n7:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nPuhala (11 points) were the only players to get into double<br />\nfigures in the loss to<br />\nGettysburg.<br />\nCoach Doherty experimented<br />\nWith a number of different<br />\nPlayer combinations, but<br />\ncouldn't find one that worked<br />\nout, and the Bullets coasted to<br />\nan easy 92-66 victory. \"They hit<br />\nthe boards much harder than<br />\nwe did,\" Coach Doherty<br />\nremarked.\"We looked good in<br />\nthe early going, but we didn't<br />\nhave a balanced scoring attack,<br />\nand the guys weren't getting<br />\nback on defense.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays will look to<br />\nturn their fortunes around at<br />\nthe Washington University<br />\nTournament today and tomorrow, where they'll meet up with<br />\nMIT, Cal Tech, and host<br />\nWashington University in St.<br />\nLouis.

He described<br />\nGhandi's death as the consequence of inside terrorism,<br />\nresulting from the conflict between the Sikhs and the Hindus.<br />\nOakley named the Middle<br />\nEast, especially Iran and Libya,<br />\nas the prominent source of<br />\nworld wide terrorism. Those<br />\ncountries are responsible for the<br />\nmajority of incidents against<br />\nthe U.S., Great Britain, Zaire,<br />\nSudan, and France. He described the terrorism in South<br />\nAmerica as a combined threat<br />\nof violence and narcotics.<br />\n\"There have been terrorism<br />\nfailures as well as successes,\"<br />\ncontinued Oakley. The vigilance of U.S. agencies, like the<br />\nFBI, has resulted in the identification of terrorists and unsuccessful assasination attempts. One example was the<br />\nthwarting of the assassination<br />\nattempt on the president of<br />\nHonduras. His would-be<br />\nassailants were imprisoned for<br />\ntheir cocaine dealing.<br />\nOakley said that terrorists<br />\ngain knowledge and information from talk about antiterrorist measures. This is the<br /><br />\nchief reason why so many of<br />\nmeasures remain<br />\nthese<br />\nclassified.<br />\nA leak in the U.S. government was responsible for the<br />\nrevelation of Italy's terrorist arrests. The Italian police were<br />\nangered by this disclosure<br />\nbecause their investigation had<br />\nnot been completed. They arrested seven Arabs, belonging,<br />\nto a ring of terrorists who had<br />\nplans to penetrate the U.S. Embasy in Rome. \"Excellent<br />\npolice work and courageous<br />\nleadership at the top are<br />\nresponsible for the suppression<br />\nof terrorism in Italy and worldwide,\" said Oakley.<br />\nHe continued that terrorists<br />\nhave a program of action in<br />\n'mind. They are not loners, as<br />\nonce believed. Their kamikaze<br />\nmissions, such as suicide bombings, are regarded by some<br />\ncultures as heroic,<br />\nOakley then addressed the<br />\nissue of counterterrorism and<br />\nprevention. The efforts to<br />\ncounteract terrorism include<br />\nnew legislation concerning hijacking, additional funds, and<br />\nthe investigation of new techniques to improve physical security for missions.<br />\nA source of controversy is<br />\nthe need for violence in certain<br />\ninstances to apprehend terrorists. Oakley said that the<br />\nsuccessful raid by Italian police<br /><br />\nis a model example of prevention<br />\nwithout<br />\nviolence.<br />\nHowever, groups that are<br />\nfanatic, well-trained, and heavily armed cannot always be stopped without violence.<br />\nSchultz believes that all U.S.<br />\ncounteractions are in selfdefense and not vengeance<br />\nagainst these organizations.<br />\nThe preferred course is to avoid<br />\nviolence. These measures indude prohibiting the export of<br />\nweapons and high technology<br />\nto countries known to advocate<br />\nterrorism. U.S. citizens are advised not to travel to these<br />\ncountries.<br />\nInternational conventions on<br />\nhijacking are examples of<br />\nworld-wide cooperation in<br />\ncombatting terrorism. In<br />\nregards to U.S. relations with<br />\nother countries, Oakley said,<br />\n\"It is important to teach them,<br />\nlearn from them, and establish<br />\ncontacts.\"<br />\nOne student from the audience asked why the U.S. cornbats terrorism world-wide and<br />\nthen supports terrorist activities<br />\nin South America. Oakley<br />\nresponded that there is a difference between insurgencies or<br />\nguerilla warfare, and terrorism.<br />\nOne targets the military and the<br />\nother victimizes civilians. He<br />\nsaid that the U.S. does not consider the insurgents in South<br />\nAmerica to be terrorists.<br /><br />\nLarry Volz<br /><br />\nAmbassador Robert Oakley who delivered the last speech of the M.S.E.<br />\nSymposium this year.

Mental health experts attribute this<br />\ndevelopment to several factors, including the<br />\nincreasingly competitive job market and the<br />\npressure to earn \"marketable\" degrees felt<br />\nby undergraduates today. The everincreasing cost of education and the desire<br />\nto fulfill personal and parental expectations<br />\nlikewise contribute to the stress experienced by students.<br />\nUndergraduates at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity are undoubtedly subjected to<br />\nthese tensions, as well as to a significant<br />\namount of pre-professional intensity.<br />\nCourses designed to \"weed out\" students,<br />\nlong study hours and professional school application processes serve only to augment an<br />\nalready high level of anxiety.<br />\nIt is essential that something be done to<br />\nalleviate this strain, particularly during the<br />\nfall semester, when students must endure the<br />\nacademic workload until the Thanksgiving<br />\nholiday without interruption. Students at the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia demanded that a twoday fall break be implemented at their school<br /><br />\nafter several of their classmates took their<br />\nown lives. According to one undergraduate,<br />\n\"The work is just nonstop. We need a day<br />\nor two off in a span of 11 weeks. Otherwise,<br />\nwho wouldn't freak out?\"<br />\nThe idea for a fall break is a sound one<br />\nand deserves serious consideration at Johns<br />\nHopkins. Unfortunately, altering the<br />\nacademic calendar at any university is a difficult, if not impossible, task. The schedule<br />\nmust satisfy the administration, the faculty<br />\nand the unions. Undergraduates do not have<br />\na great deal of priority in determining the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nAn exception should be made in this case,<br />\nhowever, since it directly involves the mental and emotional well-being of a significant<br />\nproportion of the university population.<br />\nMental health professionals, as well as<br />\nstatistical tables, support this view. Concerned Hopkins students are currently in the process of attempting to persuade the administration of the necessity of a fall holiday.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University is entirely<br />\ncapable of developing a calendar which<br />\nwould accomodate a fall interim. The question is, what will it take to convince them?<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nTaking Precautions<br />\nTo The Editor:<br /><br />\nVery recently, I went to the<br />\nbookstore and placed my<br />\nbackpack in a locker, as I had<br />\ndone a hundred times before.<br />\nOnly this time, when I came<br />\nout, my bag was nowhere to be<br />\nfound. The first things that<br />\nentered my mind were,\"maybe<br />\nsomeone moved it to a different<br />\nlocker\" and \"maybe someone<br />\npicked it up accidentally, thinking it was theirs.\" After some<br />\ninvestigation, I decided that it<br />\nhad been stolen. I'm sure that<br />\nI'm neither the first nor the last<br />\nperson to which this has happened, probably because we tell<br />\nourselves that another Hopkins<br />\nstudent wouldn't steal from us.<br />\nThis may be true, but we must<br />\nremember that our campus is<br />\nlocated in a large city and is<br />\ngenerally open to all. Unfortunately, it took something<br />\nhappening to me for me to<br />\nrealize it. Last year, as a<br />\nfreshman, I only began locking<br />\nmy door all the time after a<br />\nfriend of mine had had his<br />\nstereo taken. It always seems to<br />\ntake a personal experience to<br />\nmake us aware, which is usually too late.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that a situation exists in which precautions<br />\nsuch as locking our possessions<br />\naway are necessary, but we all<br />\nknew that we'd be living in<br />\nBaltimore when we chose Johns<br />\nHopkins. I'm simply saying<br />\nthat the extra few seconds it<br /><br />\ntakes to lock your door before<br />\ngoing to dinner or to lock that<br />\nlocker before going into the<br />\nbookstore are definitely worth<br />\nit. You can bet the house, the<br />\ncar, and whatever's behind<br />\ndoor number three that I won't<br />\nleave my property unprotected<br />\nagain. I was pretty lucky. All I<br />\nlost was my calculator (Security found the bag with<br />\neverything else intact).

Quinn; Library of<br />\nAmerica; 1408 pp., $27.50.<br />\nPoe: Poetry and Tales, one<br />\nof the three new additions to<br />\nthe Library of America's handsome series of the collected<br />\nworks of great American<br />\nwriters, is a bonanza for any<br />\naficionado of Baltimore's most<br />\nfamous story-teller, Edgar<br />\nAllan Poe. In it are all the standard masterpieces of intrigue<br />\nand Gothic horror that earned<br />\nPoe his reputation, plus a<br />\ngoldmine of rarely published,<br />\nlittle known stories, poems, and<br />\narticles that will keep a Poe<br />\nbuff entranced indefinitely.<br />\nThe real merit of this newest<br />\npublication of Poe's work is its<br />\ncomprehensiveness. Patrick F.<br />\nQuinn, who compiled and<br />\nedited the works appearing in<br />\nthe volume, has taken great<br />\ncare to reproduce all of Poe's<br />\nsurviving tales, poems, and<br />\nnovels in chronological order.<br />\nIn this way, the volume allows<br />\nPoe's literary achievement to be<br />\nviewed within the context of his<br />\nmaturation and development as<br />\na writer.<br />\nThe volume is divided into<br />\nthree parts: poetry, tales and<br />\nsketches, and novels. The first<br />\nsection begins with poems that<br />\nPoe describes in his preface as<br />\nbeing \"written in the year<br />\n1821-2, when the author had<br />\nnot completed his fourteenth<br />\nyear. They were of course not<br />\nintended for publication; why<br />\nthey are now published concerns no one but himself..<br />\nThey were written by one \"too<br /><br />\nyoung to have any knowledge<br />\nof the world but from his own<br />\nbreast.\"<br />\nMost of these early poems<br />\nconcern conventional subjects<br />\nof poetry like love and<br />\nromance. Yet, even some of the<br />\nearliest, like \"Spirits of the<br />\nDead\" and \"Dreams,\"<br />\nforeshadow Poe's later fascination with subjects of horror.<br />\nThe chronological presentation<br />\nof the sixty-three poems clearly shows his progression<br />\ntowards the fantastic and traces<br />\nthe development of his poetry<br />\nfrom adolescence to maturity.<br />\nIn the second section of the<br />\nvolume are all seventy-two of<br />\nPoe's short prose fictional<br />\nworks and several articles. The<br />\nsection starts with relatively<br />\nunknown sketches like \"The<br />\nDuc de L'Omelette,\" in which<br />\nPoe writes nearly as much in<br />\nFrench as in English. As the<br />\ndevelopment of his writing continues, he rapidly begins to produce the stories of the bizarre<br />\nthat have become his hallmark.<br />\nThese include \"Ligeia\" (the<br />\nstory he later called \"my best<br />\ntale\"), \"The Fall of the House<br />\nof Usher,\" \"William Wilson,\"<br />\n\"The Murders in the Rue<br />\nMorgue,\" \"The Tell-Tale<br />\nHeart,\" and all the other classic<br />\nwell-known (and some not so<br />\nwell-known) stories for which<br />\nhe became famous.<br />\nCharacteristic of his gothic<br />\nstyle is the following passage:<br />\nUnreal!\u2014Even while I breathed<br />\nthere came to my nostrils the breath<br />\nof the vapor of heated iron!

As we approached the anatomy labs, the<br />\ntour guide paused to repeat his<br />\ncall for questions. The guy<br />\nstanding next to me,soon to be<br />\na graduate of one of the major<br />\neast-coast establishments of<br />\nhigher learning (I'll leave it at<br />\nthat) cleared his throat and asked \"Do you get the 'Odd Couple' around here?\" No joke,<br />\nthat's what he asked. Returning<br />\nto my own major east-coast<br />\nestablishment, I recounted this<br />\nepisode to some friends, who<br />\nhad a good laugh, thanked God<br />\nthey came to Johns Hopkins,<br />\nand excused themselves to go<br />\nwatch \"Mash.\"<br />\nThere's something about a<br />\nshow like \"The Odd Couple.\"<br />\nNot only did it run on television<br />\nfor nine years, but you can flip<br />\nit on, say \"I remember this<br />\none,\" tell the person next to<br />\nyou how it ends, and watch it<br />\nanyway.<br />\nThe typical theatergoer<br />\ntherefore approaches Neil<br />\nSimon's new, female version of<br />\n\"The Odd Couple\" with both<br />\nskepticism and expectation.<br />\nThe big question is, \"What's<br />\nthe point?\" Even assuming it's<br />\nnot just a gimmick, can the play<br />\nsucceed where television's<br />\ntragic attempt at an all-black<br />\n\"Odd Couple\" failed? Mr.<br />\nSimon, who claims the script<br />\nused in 1964 is \"about seventyfive percent rewritten\" for its<br />\nBroadway debut this February,<br />\nis hopeful.<br />\nUnfortunately, Mr. Simon<br />\nhas not rewritten enough. The<br />\nmajority of the changes appear<br />\nto be in the names of the<br />\ncharacters. Instead of Felix and<br />\nOscar, we have Florence and<br />\nOlive. They still get together<br />\nwith friends to play poker on<br />\nFriday night. Florence (Sally<br />\nStruthers) is still a compulsively neat hypochondriac, while<br />\nOlive (Rita Moreno) is a slob.<br />\nAlmost all of the one-liners<br />\nthat form the backbone of the<br />\nplay remain unchanged. Olive<br />\noffers her friends green sandwiches which are either \"very<br />\nnew cheese or very old meat.\"<br />\nAs one friend observes, \"Her<br />\nrefrigerator's been broken for<br />\ntwo weeks. I saw milk standing<br />\nin there that wasn't even in the<br />\nbottle.\" At his best, Mr. Simon<br />\nuses such one-liners as the basic<br />\nbuilding blocks of a story; at his<br />\nworst, he scrapes laughs off the<br />\nbottom of the barrel.<br />\nThe play ultimately fails<br />\nbecause it refuses to recognize<br />\nthat relationships between men<br />\nand relationships between<br />\nwomen are different. When<br />\nFelix stayed home all day,<br />\ncleaned the ashtrays, and loved to cook, it was original;<br />\nwhen Florence does it, she appears to be no more than a<br />\nstereotypical housewife who's<br />\nafraid to leave her husband and<br />\ngo into the world. Similarly,<br />\nwhile Oscar was an overweight<br /><br />\nslob; Ms. Moreno's Olive is the<br />\nquite attractive producer of a 6<br />\np.m. newscast.<br />\nDirector Danny Simon<br />\n(Neil's older brother) has<br />\nchosen to emphasize the playful<br />\naspects of the script, and while<br />\nthis makes for a lot of laughs,<br />\nit eliminates the darker side of<br />\nthe play. As Walter Kerr has<br />\nwritten, \"Those two men<br />\nhaven't learned anything from<br />\ntheir marital quarrels that will<br />\nhelp them share an apartment<br />\nnow, and they aren't going to<br />\nlearn anything from their quarrels now that will help them<br />\nnext time around...They aren't<br />\ngoing anywhere, except to new<br />\nfailures.\" When Olive chases<br />\nFlorence around the couch, we<br />\nlaugh but are disappointed.<br />\nThe scene that Mr. Simon<br /><br />\nhas completely rewritten is<br />\nmarvelous.

Holly Flood and Tammy Smecker<br />\nrepeated their teammates' onetwo performance in the 50<br />\nfreestyle, and then Smecker and<br />\nJenkins again took a first and<br />\nsecond place respectively in the<br /><br />\n100 free.<br />\nThe Malcolm-Flood-JenkinsSmecker 400 freestyle relay<br />\ntook an easy first with the time<br />\nof 3:47.75, less than two<br />\nseconds off the university<br />\nrecord.<br />\nJunior captain Libby Altman<br />\nhad an outstanding meet, with<br />\na first-place finish in the 200<br />\nbreaststroke with a time of<br />\n2:42.83, and second place<br />\nfinishes in the 200 Individual<br />\nMedley and butterfly.<br />\nStrong diving from Dawn<br />\nLedbetter dominated both required and optional events. The<br />\none fright of the meet came<br />\nwhen diving captain Nancy<br />\nRobbins suffered a concussion<br />\nfrom hitting her head performing her last optional, a back one<br />\nand a half. Nancy, who is<br /><br />\nrecovering, is eager to resume<br />\ndiving and only regrets that<br />\n\"they didn't score my last<br />\ndive.\"<br />\nSuch an event shook all<br />\nmembers of the team. Jean<br />\nSchroeder, who swam the<br />\nbreastroke right after Robbins<br />\nwas taken to the hospital, said,<br />\n\"I kept seeing flashbacks of<br />\nNancy hitting her head on the<br />\nboard during the race.\" Nevertheless, Schroeder finished her<br />\n200 event, with a time of<br />\n3:19.67.<br />\nThe Jay men remained<br />\nundefeated with an easy 67-45<br />\nwin over the Devils. Again it<br />\nwas one-two finishes late in the<br />\nmeet which clinched the victory, as captain Dickie Johnson<br />\ntook a 2:07.30 first place to<br />\nDan Fritsch's 2:11.21 second in<br /><br />\nthe 200 backstroke.<br />\nPaul Bowan finished with a<br />\n4:57.63 first place to captain<br />\nJim Cutrone's 5:07.51 second<br />\nin the 500 free, and Mark<br />\nPostler's 200 fly took a 2:00.89<br />\nfirst place while teammate Don<br />\nPrice finished at 2:02.72.<br />\nFreshman Ian Brooks, who<br />\nhad been out earlier in the<br />\nseason due to a shoulder injury,<br />\nfinished second in the 50<br />\nfreestyle with a time of 22.83<br />\nbehind Dickinson's Gunster.<br />\nTeammate John Benkovich was<br />\nclose behind in fourth with a<br />\ntime of 23.25.<br />\nWelsh<br />\nremarked<br />\non<br />\nBenkovich's superb stroke.<br />\n\"Man, he rides high. No one<br />\ncan teach you to swim like that.<br />\nGod teaches you to swim like<br />\nthat.\"<br /><br />\nFritsch came from behind in<br />\nthe last 200 yards of the 1000.<br />\nfree to touch out his Dickinson<br />\ncompetition by one onehundredth of a second with a<br />\ntime of 10:33.47. Chris Anderson also dominated both onemeter requireds and optionals<br />\nin the diving events.<br />\nBoth the men and women<br />\nhope to repeat their wins again<br />\ntoday at Gettysburg.

Having played her<br />\nfreshman and sophomore years<br />\nat Hopkins, she gained the<br />\nnumber 4 spot two years ago,<br />\nand has shown consistency and<br />\npromise in practice thus far.<br />\nAlso responsible for the<br />\nteam's improved prospects is<br />\nthe number one player for three<br />\nyears and captain for two,<br />\nsenior Jessie Chai. Coming off<br />\nan impressive field hockey<br /><br />\nseason, Coach Goodyear<br />\ndescribes her as being \"in excellent shape, more mature,<br />\nconscientious, and with more<br />\nsavvy.\"<br />\nConcerned as well with the<br />\nentire team, Captain Chai concurs with the coach about the<br />\ntroupe's chances of enhancing<br />\nlast year's 2-4 dual meet record.<br />\nShe, too, cites the increased<br />\ndepth of the squad.<br />\nCoach Goodyear hopes the<br />\ngroup will attain a .500 record<br />\nin this season's dual meets. At<br />\nthe 1984 Howe Cup Tournament at Yale University, the<br />\nLady Jays finished a strong<br />\nfourth out of seven teams in<br />\ntheir division. This year, says<br />\nthe coach, they should do even<br />\nbetter.<br />\nThose who played at Yale<br />\nand are returning this season<br />\nare seniors Mary Voytko, a<br />\nnotable powerhouse; Tammy<br />\nHuck; and Josephine Mei.<br />\nOther returnees from the<br />\n1983-84 fleet are sophomore<br />\nCharlotte Seydel, who participated in the 1984 Penn<br />\nRound Robin Tournament;<br />\njunior Ilga Celmins; and<br />\nsophomore Suzanne Stamatov.<br />\n- The two beginners on the team,<br />\nboth freshmen, are Marlene<br />\nSchwaeber and Beth Yip, who<br />\nare progressing well.<br />\nThe squash schedule for this<br />\nseason is much like last year's.<br />\nDue to the small number of<br />\nschools in the area which have<br />\nteams, Hopkins is limited to<br />\nplaying two dual meets each<br /><br />\n(one at home, one away)<br />\nagainst Swarthmore and<br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall. The<br />\nbrigade will again compete in<br />\nthe prestigious Howe Cup<br />\nTournament at Yale and the<br />\nPenn Round Robin at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania in<br />\nPhiladelphia. This latter event,<br />\nwhich is held on Saturday,<br />\nFebruary 16, is preceded on Friday night by two dual matches<br />\nagainst Cornell and Penn at the<br />\nsame locale.<br />\nAn added attraction is<br />\ntonight's Baltimore City Open<br />\nTournament, in which five of<br />\nthe team's top players will battle local squashers in area clubs.<br /><br />\nIf they fare well this evening,<br />\nindividual players will proceed<br />\nto advanced rounds of the<br />\ntourney on Saturday and<br />\nperhaps Sunday.<br />\nSpectators are urged to attend the free home matches<br />\nwith Swarthmore and Franklin<br />\n&amp; Marshall on Friday, January<br />\n25 at 4:00 p.m. and Tuesday,<br />\nFebruary 19 at 6:00 p.m.,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nFinally, Coach Goodyear<br />\nhad this to say about his expectations for the team this year,<br />\nexemplifying his tough, yet simple, optimistic attitude: \"They<br />\ncame to play the game.\"<br /><br />\nThis past weekend the Three<br />\non Three Basketball Tournament was held and a team from<br />\nDU won the overall title as well<br />\nas the Fraternity Championship, while teams from Phi Psi<br />\nfinished 2nd and 3rd.

T21<br />\nCentralia, WA 98531<br /><br />\nby Mike Silverman<br />\nPlagued by poor free-throw<br />\nshooting and a lack of strong<br />\nrebounding, the Hopkins<br />\nbasketball team found the going rough early in the year, losing its first two games of the<br />\nseason. In their home opener<br />\non November 17, the Blue Jays<br />\nwere defeated by a stubborn<br />\nMary Washington Squad,<br />\n65-61. The Jays found even<br />\nmore problems on the road, as<br />\nthey were dealt a 92-66 loss at<br />\nthe hands of a tough Gettysburg team on November 20.<br />\nWeakness at the foul line,<br />\nand a strong second half surge<br />\nby Mary Washington, led to<br />\nHopkins' initial defeat. The<br />\nJays led the Rebels 30-19 at<br />\nhalftime, and increased that<br />\nlead to seventeen points later in<br />\nthe second half, but a four<br />\nminute stretch in which the offense could not score caused the<br />\nlead to evaporate. Following a<br />\ntechnical foul called on forward<br />\nSteve Mitchell, Mary Washington guard Warner Dyke canned three free throws and connected on a 15 foot jumper to<br />\nnarrow the Hopkins lead to<br />\n45-41.<br />\n\"After they got the five<br />\nstraight points on the technical<br />\nand foul, and we couldn't con-<br /><br />\nJunior Mike Sohr<br /><br />\nvert at the other end of the<br />\ncourt, the momentum switched<br />\nto their favor,\" said Hopkins<br />\nCoach Ed Doherty.<br />\nBy out-rebounding Hopkins<br />\nand converting on critical free<br />\nthrow attempts, Mary Washington eventually took a 52-49<br />\nlead, which it never relinquished.
