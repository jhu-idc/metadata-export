However, it is unlikely that the Council<br />\nwould defy an Assembly mandate on calendar<br />\nreform, either pro or con.<br />\nThe main SC deliberations, however,<br />\ncentered not on a strike,- but rather on the<br />\nwording of the student referendum. Dave Clark<br />\nsuggested that a proposition be included calling<br />\nfor a strike if the Academic Council does not<br />\napprove implementation of the 4-1-4 reforms for<br />\n1969. .<br />\nHowever, it was felt that the threat of a<br />\nstrike at this time might be interpreted by the<br />\nfaculty as undue pressure and result in a General<br />\nAssembly backlash.<br />\n(Continued on page 5)<br />\n<br />\nProtest Teach-In Atttacks<br />\nABM,Military Research<br />\nBy JACK HOLLIS<br />\n<br />\nMeeting in Levering Hall on March 4<br />\nfor a Teach-1n, approximately 200<br />\nstudents heard speakers protest both the<br />\nproposed anti-ballistic missile system and<br />\nthe presence of the military in American<br />\nuniversities.<br />\nCommon themes in the speeches<br />\nwere attacks on all defense research,<br />\nclassified or otherwise, especially chemical<br />\nand biological warfare work and<br />\ncounter-insurgency work.

At that<br />\ntime, CAB Examiner Arthur Present attacked<br />\nthe fares as being \"unjustly discriminatory\"<br />\nagainst passengers who are over 21.<br />\nBoth the National Student Marketing Corporation<br />\nand the National Student Association reacted to the<br />\nruling by announcing that they would fight for a<br />\nreversal. A group called Campus Americans for<br />\nDemocratic Action has joined in the protest and all three<br />\ngroups will represent student interests by filing briefs in<br />\nfavor of youth fares at the next CAB hearing on March<br />\n12th.<br />\nCongressional Response<br />\nMembers of Congress have also reacted against the<br />\nproposed ban. At least 16 Representatives, led by Rep.<br />\n<br />\nArnold Olsen (D. Montana)have introduced a resolution<br />\nin the House supporting the continuation of all children,<br />\nyouth and military fares on domestic airlines. The<br />\nresolution claims that such fares are not inconsistent<br />\nwith the intent and purposes of the Federal Aviation Act<br />\nof 1958 as is claimed by some members of CAB.<br />\nRepresentative James Scheuer (D. New York) has<br />\noffered an amendment to the 1958 Aviation Act that<br />\nwould explicitly give the CAB the right to grant Youth<br />\nFares. Senator Percy of Illinois has introduced a similar<br />\nmeasure in the Senate.<br />\nNo Benefits<br />\nRepresentative Olsen contended that \"No one<br />\nwould benefit from an elimination of these fares. As a<br />\nmatter of fact, it would very likely lead to a general<br />\nincrease in fares because two of the three fare categories<br />\ninvolved apply only to seats which would otherwise go<br />\nvacant.\"<br />\nA group of students on the Hopkins campus has<br />\nalso been involved in fighting the CAB ruling. They<br />\ncollected signatures for a petition from Hopkins,<br />\nTowson State, and Baltimore Junior College. The<br />\npetitions included more than 1300 signatures and they<br />\nwere presented to the CAB this past Wednesday along<br />\nwith petitions from 4000 students from the Washington,<br />\nD.C. area.<br />\n<br />\nOne student in the Hopkins group said that a<br />\nstudent committee will continue to push for a reversal of<br />\nthe CAB's ruling. The committee hopes to mount a<br />\ncampaign to interest more congressmen in the problem<br />\nand it has urged all Hopkins students to write to their<br />\ncongressmen or at least send them a special Western<br />\nUnion telegram. Since the final decision on youth fares<br />\nhas not been made yet, the committee thinks that there<br />\nis still some chance for incluencing the final outcome.<br />\nThe NSA is willing to go beyond the CAB to keep<br />\nyouth fares alive. The group has retained the services of<br />\na Washington law firm, Koteen and Burt, who are<br />\nexperts in the field of air fares. The group claims that it<br />\nwill take the issue to court if the final CAB ruling is<br />\nunfavorable. The NSA will present oral arguments at the<br />\nupcoming CAB hearings.<br />\nThe NSA position claims that youth fares should<br />\nnot be abolished because they create \"an extraordinary<br />\nopportunity to broaden educational horizons\" by<br />\nbringing air travel within the reach of students for the<br />\nfirst time. Moreover, the NSA claims that the banning of<br />\nyouth fares is being pushed by a special lobby group<br />\nrepresenting the major bus companies of the country.<br />\n<br />\nHarnik and Drake Elected<br />\nNew Dooks in N-L Vote<br />\nPeter Harnik and Bruce Drake<br />\nwere elected Editors-in-Chief in the<br />\n74th annual News-Letter elections last<br />\nTuesday night.<br />\nDrake, a 20 year old junior from<br />\nEast Rockaway, New York, was<br />\nreelected for a second term of oifice.<br />\nDrake is an English major.<br />\nHarnik, who was Managing Editor<br />\n'during the past year, is a history major<br />\nfrom New York City.

As for the<br />\nbreak-down of the actual time normally<br />\ndevoted by the researcher to military<br />\nresearch, Hamburger felt that it had not<br />\n\"changed significantly.\"<br />\n80% Of His Time<br />\nThe typical researcher working<br />\nunder a military contract devotes 80%<br />\nof HS' time to applied but not<br />\nnecessarily classified research. At least<br />\nhalf of this time is spent on research<br />\nwhich is definitely not classified. The<br />\nother half is directed along more closely<br />\nmilitarily-related topics. Of the<br />\n<br />\nremaining 20%, 5% of the researchers<br />\ntime is free to work in any area he<br />\ndesires; 15% is devoted to esoteric<br />\nresearch pursuits which would normally<br />\nnot be investigated were it not for the<br />\nmilitary support.<br />\nhamburger indicates that \"If we<br />\nhad our druthers, we would prefer not<br />\nto do any classified research at all.\" He<br />\nfelt, however, that \"for the amount of<br />\nclassified 'research we do, it is a small<br />\nprice to pay for what they pay for basic<br />\nresearch.\" \"It also might be considered<br />\na basic duty of the university to support<br />\nour nation,\" he added.<br />\nMany of the research reports<br />\nwhich are classified are also published in<br />\nslightly bowlderized form for the<br />\ngeneral consumption. What is deleted<br />\nfrom the classified report is a \"military<br />\nrider,\" usually in the form of an<br />\nintroduction, which explains to the<br />\nmilitary the applications of the research<br />\nto their needs. \"It is necessary,\" said<br />\nHamburger, \"that we demonstrate to<br />\nthe military that our basic research can<br />\nbe of use to them; it may happen that<br />\nthe military might not even understand<br />\nthe research that was done.\" He tells the<br />\n, story of one researcher who published<br />\n;the same paper twice, once with a<br />\nmilitary applications introduction, as a<br />\nclassified document, and once as an<br />\nunclassified document with a normal<br />\nintroduction. The only difference<br />\nbetween the two papers was the<br />\nintroduction.<br />\nHamburger, thought, that the<br />\n,<br />\nMilitary applications riders were<br />\n<br />\nnecessary, since \"the research is<br />\nmilitarily supported.\" The rider allows<br />\nthe researcher to pursue<br />\nbasical-orientated research and still have<br />\nit supported by the military. Hamburger<br />\nfelt that it did not restrict the workers<br />\nin any way, and did often allow them<br />\naccess to documents which would<br />\notherwise be unavailable to them.<br />\n<br />\nGeorge Johnston and Kevin Klesock.<br />\nCooper and Franke had filled the<br />\nposition for the past two years.<br />\nDavid Hoelscher, former City<br />\nEditor, was named News Director.

Black students across the country have<br />\nused tactics ranging from evacuation of campus to vandalism in order to support and<br />\ndramatize a wide variety of demands.<br />\nDemands<br />\nMost of these demands have<br />\nrevolved around three issues: 1) the<br />\ncreation and autonomy of programs in<br />\nblack studies; 2) university policies for<br />\nadmission of students and hiring of<br />\nfaculty; and 3) alleged discrimination<br />\nagainst black students by faculty and<br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\ncampus police.<br />\nStudents at Brown, the.<br />\nUnder this plan different branches<br />\nUniversities of Wisconsin and North<br />\nof the school, such as the Admissions<br />\nCarolina, the City College of New York,<br />\nOffice and the library, would find room<br />\nand others have demanded programs in<br />\nin their budgets for funding the<br />\nblack studies.

The summer classes were held<br />\nin Gilman Hall and consisted of English<br />\nand Mathmatics, Art, Music, and<br />\nBiology. English and Math were<br />\nrequired for everyone, while Art and<br />\nMusic were each taken by half the<br />\ngroup. A number of students expressed<br />\nan interest in Biology, so a class was<br />\nformed. It was held during the second<br />\nsummer session and was attended by<br />\n15-18 students.<br />\n\"MotivateThese People\"<br />\n,According to Mr. Dates the<br />\npurpose of the Project was \"to motivate<br />\n<br />\nthese young people to remain in high<br />\nschool and go on to college.\" He felt<br />\nthat the success of the program is<br />\nindicated by the fact that \"a great many<br />\nhave changed their attitudes about going<br />\non to college.\" Of the forty-four<br />\nstudents who entered the program,<br />\nthirty-five plan to go to college<br />\nsomewhere.<br />\nSince the students will be<br />\ngraduating this summer, most of them<br />\nhave already applied to the colleges of<br />\ntheir choice. The University helped<br />\nthem with their choices by giving<br />\ncounseling advice and supplying<br />\ninformation on the various schools. Mr.<br />\nDates said that even though the program<br />\nwas not planned to recruit students for<br />\nHopkins, a number have applied to the<br />\nUniversity, and one has already been<br />\naccepted.<br />\nWhen asked if the Project would<br />\nbe continued with a new group of.<br />\nstudents this summer, Mr. Dates<br />\nanswered that no concrete plans have<br />\nyet been made. The main problem, he<br />\nsaid, is in funding. The first program<br />\nwas wholly financed by the Baltimore<br />\ncity school system, and though there<br />\nhas been a \"favorable reaction from the<br />\nschool system\" over the program, no<br />\nnew funds have been appropriated. Mr.<br />\nDates said that he didn't know if the<br />\ncity schools would make funds available<br />\nfor next year. He also didn't know if<br />\nHopkins would be able to supply any<br />\nmoney to the program.<br />\nWhen asked, if there were any<br />\nplans afoot to include programs such as<br />\n<br />\nthis in the mini-semester of the new<br />\ncalendar, Mr. Dates said that he hadn't<br />\nthought about it. He did indicate some<br />\npossibilities, however, pointing out that<br />\nsomething of a tutorial nature might be<br />\nworked out between his office and the<br />\nSocial Relations Department or some of<br />\nthe other organizations operating in this<br />\narea.<br />\n<br />\nVICTOR DATES, Director of Special<br />\nPrograms at Homewood.<br />\n<br />\nGuess, a leading spokesman for<br />\nBlack students on campus, has<br />\nscheduled a program of Negro<br />\nleaders to speak on Black<br />\nawareness from a Black point of<br />\nview during the coming month.<br />\nThe program, which has been<br />\ncalled Black March, began yesterday<br />\nwith Rev.

Questions such as housing, cost, etc., will be'<br />\nstudies by other groups, probably by those<br />\nadministration agencies already existing.<br />\nHopefully a report will be made in \"the not too<br />\ndistant future,\" according to Carl P. Swanson, Associate<br />\nDean for Undergraduate Studies and chairman of the<br />\nnew committee. Dr. Swanson would like to see the work<br />\nof his board completed for the next Academic Council<br />\nmeeting, on March 26. No extensive research will be<br />\nrequired, as they will be studying the statistics in the<br />\nYale, Princeton, and Franklin and Marshall reports on<br />\ncoeducation.<br />\nBesides Dr. Swanson the committee is composed<br />\nof Director of Admissions William L. Brinkley, and two<br />\nor three faculty members, not yet selected. Representing<br />\nthe undergraduate body are Dean Rudoy, Russ<br />\nPassarella, and Chuck Steinberg.<br />\n<br />\nFaculty to Debate<br />\nCalendar Reforms<br />\n(Continued from page 1)<br />\n<br />\nCouncil President Passarella said of the<br />\nPossibility of calendar reform rejection by the<br />\nAcademic Council, \"We'll have to talk about it<br />\nWhen we're faced with it.\"<br />\nDean of Undergraduate Studies, Carl P.<br />\nSwanson, who was present at the SC meeting,<br />\nprobed to find the Student Council's \"real<br />\ngoals\" within the realm of calendar reform<br />\npossibilities.<br />\nHe was informed by Strike Committee member<br />\nChuck Steinberg that \"I saw Dr. Bevan's Committee<br />\nReport (advocating the 4-1-4 system) as a whole, and I<br />\nsupported it as a whole.\" Passarella added that, \"I really<br />\ndon't think it would be a wise move at all to split up the<br />\nproposal. I think that the Council ought to stand on the<br />\ncalendar reform as a whole.\"<br />\nBy a twelve-vote margin, the SC decided to limit<br />\nthe school-wide referendum to the single proposition:<br />\n\"Are you in favor of the 4-1-4 system as submitted by<br />\nDr. Bevan's committee?\"<br />\n4-1-4 Explained<br />\nAccording to the Committee, the 4-1-4 plan<br />\nconsists of \"two 13-14 week semesters separated by a<br />\n4-week, one course, January term in place of the present<br />\nlate-ending academic year of two 16-week semesters.<br />\nThe fall term would begin on either the first or second<br />\nMonday after Dabor Day, depending on whether Labor<br />\nDow was early or late, and would be concluded by<br />\nmid-December.<br />\n\"(The question of optional or mandatory<br />\nenrollment in the January term is a matter to be decided<br />\nby the Dean of Arts and Sciences and his faculty<br />\ncolleagues. Various patterns are possible. One that seems<br />\nreasonable to the present committee would make<br />\nenrollment required of freshmen and sophomores but<br />\nOptional for juniors and seniors).<br />\n\"The fourteen week spring term would begin on<br />\nthe first Monday in February and conclude in mid-May<br />\nafter including a one-week spring vacation scheduled at<br />\nthe end of the 9th week of the term, regardless of the<br />\nproximity of the religious holidays of March and April.\"<br />\nThe Academic Council could decide to implement<br />\nonly part of the suggested reforms for 1969, approve the<br />\ncommittee report as it stands, amend it, or table the<br />\nreport for further action. Any of these moves would<br />\nconstitute the promised \"decision\" on calendar reform.<br />\nHowever, if the entire matter were tabled by the<br />\nAcademic Council, it is improbable that implementation<br />\ncould be achieved in 1969.<br />\nRealizing the urgency of the situation, the Student<br />\nCouncil, last week, sent a letter to President Lincoln<br />\nGordon demanding a \"positive response\" from the<br />\nadministration on the calendar refform question.<br />\nCouncil officers Russ Passarella and Manuel<br />\nRodriguez met with Dr. Gordon for three hours on<br />\nFebruary 25 to discuss the issue at which time Gordon<br />\nagreed to allow the SC to present its demands to the<br />\nAcademic Council on the following afternoon.<br />\nThe Council decided to call a special session of the<br />\nGeneral Faculty Assembly to consider the calendar<br />\nreform proposals, and agreed to settle the entire matter<br />\nby March 26.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Dean Swanson \"the students on the<br />\ncommittee will have the responsibility for sampling the<br />\nopinions of the student body.\" Dr. Allyn W. Kimball,<br />\nDean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, believes that<br />\nknowledge of undergraduate viewpoints is essential<br />\nbefore coeducation can be taken before the General<br />\nAssembly of the faculty. Rudoy stated that a<br />\nreferendum will probably be held after the committee<br />\ndelivers its report.<br />\nIf the new committee recommends that<br />\ncoeducation was academically desirable and feasible,<br />\nthen the next step would be ratification by the General<br />\nAssembly of the faculty. Last month they approved the<br />\nprinciple of coeducation, but no specific mention of<br />\nHopkins was made.<br />\nConsent Of Trustees<br />\nAfter the General Assembly, coeducation would<br />\nhave to be approved by the Academic Council, the<br />\n16-man board which determines major University policy.<br />\nNext, President Lincoln Gordon and the administration<br />\nwould have to consider the question. After that stage the<br />\nconsent of the trustees would most likely be required,<br />\n<br />\nalthough formal channels of approval are somewhat<br />\nuncertain, as there is no precedent for such a significant<br />\nchange in the University structure.<br />\n\"The main obstacle to coeducation is the cost,\"<br />\ndeclared Dean Kimball. Practical and economic<br />\ndifficulties, such as housing and facilities, would have to<br />\nbe solved by the administration, who would ultimately<br />\ndecide if enough funds were available for the project.<br />\nBut Dean Kimball believes that \"by and large you find<br />\nthe administration to be quite favorable to this.\"<br />\nInvestigation of coeducation really began in 1964<br />\nin some subcommittees of the Long Range Planning<br />\nCommittee, a two-year study. The question also came up<br />\nin consideration of the proposed School of Allied Health<br />\nSciences.<br />\nNo formal discussions on coeducation were held<br />\nsince that time, until this February. The General<br />\nAssembly approved the issue \"in principle\" and Dean<br />\nSwanson's committee was formed. Also significant were<br />\nthe regular monthly meetings Dean Kimball held with<br />\nthe chairmen of the departments in the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences.<br />\n<br />\nAdmission of Women Announced by Yale<br />\nHighltghttng National Coeducation Trend<br />\nGoheen announced that the plans for the addmission of<br />\nwomen would be presented in April or June this year.<br />\nWhen Princeton does go coed Dartmouth will be the<br />\nonly Ivy to deny women undergraduate status.<br />\nAmong the colleges going coed this fall are<br />\nWesleyan, Colgate, Vassar and Bennington. In addition<br />\nKenyon will be coed in the immediate future and Wells<br />\nCollege is considering the creation of a coordinate men's<br />\nbranch within the next five years. At South Bend Notre<br />\nDame is considering ties with St. Mary's although there<br />\nwill be complications because the faculty of St. Mary's is<br />\ninferior to that of Notre Dame. Harvard and Radcliffe<br />\nare now considering a full merger which might include<br />\nexperimental coed dorms. Elmira College in New York<br />\nwill admit men to its full time program for the first time<br />\nin 114 years this fall.<br />\nThe students want coeducation so that \"the<br />\n\u2022<br />\nmale-female relationship will be taken out of the<br />\nabsurdly pressured situation of the weekend date. A lot<br />\nof guys think of women as objects, or dumb broads, but<br />\nthey're human beings too.\" as Aviam Soifer,the head of<br />\nYale's Coeducation Week, stated. Administrators are<br />\nattracted to coeducation because they feel that it would<br />\nattract more students and therefore more money to the<br />\ncampuses. However, Arthur J. Horton, director of<br />\ndevelopment at Princeton and sole dissenter from the<br />\nconclusions of the Patterson committee report, stated<br />\nthat coeducation could \"have a damaging effect on our<br />\noverall fund raising efforts. In fact, I fear that there will<br />\nbe alumni who, liking the university as an all male<br />\n;institution, could lose much of their present ardor.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe decision of Yale to admit women<br />\nundergraduates next fall is indicative of a<br />\ngrowing movement toward coeducation.<br />\n<br />\nBreaking its 267 year tradition Yale will have 500<br />\nundergraduate women on campus this fall. The Yale<br />\nmove was made in response to what Yale president<br />\nKingman Brewster, Jr. called,\"The very high motivation<br />\nand energetic responsibility of the present Yale<br />\nstudents.\" An example of this motivation was the<br />\nCoeducation Week, sponsored by the undergraduate<br />\nbody during the first week of last November. 700 girls<br />\nfrom 22 eastern colleges participated in the program,<br />\nattending classes and meals with boys and living in their<br />\nrooms, vacated for the week..<br />\nMoves toward coeducation have also been made by<br />\nPrinceton. A study presented to University president<br />\nRobert Goheen by Dr. Gardner Patterson, professor of<br />\nEconomics at Princeton, stated that coeducation would<br />\n\"greatly enrich the cultural and social life of students<br />\nand would tend to develop in undergraduates a sense of<br />\nresponsibility toward one another. We believe that for<br />\nPrinceton to remain an all male institution in the face of<br />\ntoday's evolving social system would be out of keeping<br />\nwith her past willingness to change with the times.\"<br />\nThe study estimated that the addition of 1000<br />\ncoeds to the Princeton student body would swell<br />\noperating expenses by $300,000 and additional capital<br />\ncosts would total $25 million.

It would lower<br />\nour standards...\"<br />\nResponse<br />\nThe favored response to the problem is<br />\nremedial training to \"bring them up to the<br />\ncollege level.\" Many of the schools at which<br />\nthese programs are in operation have been the<br />\nscenes of the loudest black student protest (i.e.<br />\nUniversity of lllinois, Queens College, NYU...).<br />\nStudents in such programs often feel that they<br />\nare just being told again that they are inferior,<br />\nand sense waves of condescension from<br />\nadministrators and other students. And the<br />\ndemand fro a say in the running of the program<br />\nseldom fails to appear.<br />\n<br />\n\"Under such circumstances it is easier to<br />\ntake the bait of the black studies department ane<br />\nchew it as though we believe it is the real meat of<br />\nthe problem.

If<br />\nuniversities cannot reach and communicate with<br />\n, America's subcultures and minorities they don't<br />\ndeserve to survive. Hence the demand for open<br />\nblack admissions.<br />\n<br />\nStrong Commitment<br />\nOther demands of black students have<br />\nreflected a strong commitment to the progress of<br />\ntheir community. A committee of students from<br />\nNew York's Hunter College barged into a faculty<br />\nmeeting and demanded that they be excused<br />\nfrom their courses and given credit for teaching<br />\nghetto pupils during the teacher's strike. CCNY<br />\nblack students joined with Puerto Rican students<br />\nin demanding that Spanish be made a<br />\nrequirement for education majors.<br />\n<br />\nThe Kent State University black<br />\ncommunity evacuated campus to press their<br />\ndemand that \"racist\" Oakland police not be<br />\nallowed to recruit. San Fernando State activists<br />\noccupied the administration building demanding<br />\nthe dismissal of a coach who struck a black<br />\nstudent. University of Massachusetts student<br />\ntook a building demanding the appointment of<br />\nNegro policemen and the firing of two officers<br />\nwho stood by passively while white students beat<br />\nup a \"brother\".<br />\n<br />\nAnd of course, the demand that more and<br />\nmore blacks be admitted to universities has been<br />\nraised by students at San Francisco State, CCNY,<br />\nBrandeis, Swarthmore, Duke, and the University<br />\nof Wisconsin. The cry of open admission for<br />\nblack students is increasingly heard. Black<br />\nactivists acknowledge that most colleges are<br />\nfinally aware that it is both desirable and<br />\nnecessary to change their racial and economic<br />\nmake up. The question is how to do it. Clark<br />\n<br />\nThe list is endless and diverse. The<br />\ncommon thread running through the demands of<br />\nblack students across the country is that they are<br />\ndemands\u2014one no longer hears of protests. And<br />\nthe common problem faced by college presidents<br />\nis that of dealing with a small minority with a<br />\nhistory of oppression, issuing demands for<br />\nimmediate change, and willing to disrupt<br />\nuniversity activity and face administrative<br />\nsanction in the fight for change.<br />\n<br />\nOCCASION EXTRAORDINARY OR JUST<br />\nANY OCCASION-LET US INSURE<br />\nTHE SUCCESS<br />\n<br />\nEDDIE'S GOURMET SHOPPE<br />\n3109 ST.

Together with the<br />\nNon-Communist Manifesto of<br />\nWalt Rostow, the resolution of<br />\nthe Student Council will be<br />\nremembered by posterity as one<br />\nof the great documents of the<br />\n20th Century. Nevertheless, I shall<br />\ntake the liberty to add a few<br />\ncomments.<br />\nThe Student Council<br />\ncertainly represents the \"vast<br />\nconsensus of the undergraduate<br />\nstudent body\" as far as calendar<br />\nreform in general is concerned,<br />\nbut the current discussion<br />\ncompletely ignores that solutions<br />\nother than a 4-1-4 system are<br />\npossible. The report of the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee recommends the 4-1-4<br />\nplan, but this does not oblige<br />\nanyone, least of all the students,<br />\nto agree.<br />\nDespite all the interesting<br />\nand often idealistic proposals, it<br />\nseems that no one has the slightest<br />\nidea about what should go on<br />\nduring the mini-semester. Small<br />\nclasses are a brilliant, though not<br />\nexactly new, idea, but it is<br />\ndoubtful that the faculty-student<br />\nratio will improve, as if by<br />\nmagic, as soon as the new plan<br />\ngoes into effect. If it does<br />\nimprove, why not maintain it for<br />\nthe rest of the year? As for<br />\nindependent study, there are<br />\nmany opportunities under the<br />\ncurrent system. For those juniors<br />\nand seniors who do not attend (if<br />\nthey are given this option), the<br />\nmini-semester would be a waste of<br />\ntime which could be used more<br />\nproductively in summer. Besides,<br />\nit is not clear why freshmen and<br />\nsophomores should be subject to<br />\ndiscrimination.<br />\nBut all these arguments<br />\nprobably _ did not concern the<br />\ncommittee anyway. In an attempt<br />\nto find a compromise between the<br />\nmedical institutions, various other<br />\nBaltimore colleges, and student<br />\ndemands, the committee hit upon<br />\na solution which can hardly stand<br />\non its own merits. I hope that the<br />\nalternatives, such as a plan with<br />\ntwo semesters and a<br />\nMay-to-August vacation, or a<br />\nTrimester system like Goucher's,<br />\nwill be considered again whet% the<br />\ndust has settled somewhat.<br />\nMeanwhile, I recommend<br />\nthat the Student Council think<br />\ntwice before it generously dispense<br />\nstrike threats to all corners. The<br />\nstudents are not prepared to<br />\nfollow their leaders unless they<br />\nare directly consulted, and the<br />\nadministration is not deeply<br />\nimpressed by threats unless the<br />\nstudent body is really prepared to<br />\ntake action. A dual credibility gap<br />\nshould be avoided by all means, or<br />\nelse we ,shall soon have occasion<br />\nto see a few lonely members of<br />\nthe Student Council stand on the<br />\n<br />\nsteps of -Gilman Hall,<br />\nself-consciously waving a strike<br />\nplacard, while faculty and<br />\nstudents attend their classes and a<br />\nchoir of administration officials<br />\nlaughs in the background.<br />\nDaniel Niehans '71<br />\n<br />\nCIVILIZING EFFECT<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was very interested in Dr.<br />\nRobert A. Gordon's letter which<br />\nappeared in last week's issue. I<br />\nagree wholeheartedly with Dr.<br />\nGordon's criticism of the<br />\nproposed ABM system, but I must<br />\ntake issue with his evaluation of<br />\ncivilian participation in military<br />\nresearch as a \"civilianizing\" effect<br />\non the military.<br />\nTo make my point, let's go<br />\nback to the late 40's and early<br />\n5 O's, when such civilian<br />\nparticipation was envisioned as a<br />\ncheck on the military. At that<br />\ntime, I would imagine, the liberals<br />\nof the day recognized the need for<br />\nmassive defense expenditures to<br />\nprotect your country, but at the<br />\nsame time envisioned civilian<br />\nparticipation as the sort of thing<br />\nthat would prevent incidents like<br />\nVietnam and the Dominican<br />\nRepublic, bloated defense<br />\nbudgets, war and peacetime<br />\nprofiteering, etc. Well, it didn't,<br />\nand the reason for failure is very<br />\nsimple: the military was never the<br />\nproblem! The problem is the<br />\nAmerican corporation, the same<br />\n\"civilian\" institution which<br />\nwound up controlling the military<br />\nresearch. After all, it is the<br />\ncorporations which benefit the<br />\nmost from big defense budgets<br />\nand big armies to protect their<br />\nvast foreign holdings; so<br />\nconsequently, one can hardly<br />\nhope for a civilizing influence<br />\nfrom such quarters.<br />\nThe radicals of today are<br />\nrefusing to be co-opted by<br />\ninstitutions which claim to be<br />\n\"public,\" \"civilian,\" and all that<br />\njazz, but which are in reality<br />\nundemocratic, monopolistic<br />\nmanipulators. If we really want<br />\ncivilian control over the military,<br />\nthen what we need are civilian<br />\ninstitutions whose actions are<br />\nguided by the needs of society<br />\nrather than personal profit.<br />\nIn my view, the military is<br />\nby and large the handmaid of the<br />\ncorporations, and is subordinate<br />\nto the ends of capitalism. We are<br />\nnow in a period of rampant<br />\nimperialism, an imperialism which<br />\ncan make was on an<br />\nunderdeveloped country to secure<br />\nthe great tin and tungsten supplies<br />\nso \"necessary\" to our already<br />\nover-producing economy.

A year which has witnessed<br />\nthe coronation of Nixon and the abdication of Lyndon. Spiro Agnew,<br />\nformerly of Maryland, now presides over the Senate, while everyone prays<br />\nfor the safety of the President. Robert Kennedy has joined his brother on<br />\nthat quiet knoll in Arlington, Virginia. The analysis of the Kerner report,<br />\nof a nation divided into two separate societies, becomes more of a truism<br />\nas black and white daily confront each other as enemies and not brothers.<br />\nAnd, of course, the immoral war goes on in Southeast Asia while the<br />\ndiplomats play games in Paris.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nWe began with McCarthy's victory in New Hampshire, an incident<br />\nwhich foretold the beginnings of a unique student movement. Martin<br />\nLuther King was murdered last April and the summer riots erupted three<br />\nmonths earlier than predicted. The disturbances in Baltimore were mild in<br />\ncomparison to Washington. Emerging from Dr. King's death was a new<br />\nattitude on the part of students and universities in regard to relationships<br />\nWith the urban community. Hopkins has taken its first step in this<br />\ndirection in the establishment of an Urban Center, increased tutorial<br />\nprojects, and greater health care for the residents of East Baltimore.<br />\nWhile the rest of the country was worrying about the riots and the<br />\nwar, Hopkins students continued to show almost no interest in the outside<br />\nworld. We won another lacrosse championship with Joe Cowan leading the<br />\nBlue Jays, while the peace talks got underway in France. Then the<br />\nsummer came and the conventions overshadowed everything else. The<br />\nmighty hand of Mayor Daley was felt throughout the country as his<br />\ncharges used gestapo tactics to put down the demonstrators at the<br />\nDemocratic fiasco in Chicago. Returning to Hopkins after four months,<br />\none could sense a new feeling in the air, one which seemed to breathe of<br />\nconcern on the part of this student body. Orientation set the scene for<br />\nthis change on the formerly placid campus of Homewood. No longer was<br />\nit merely a period of gaiety in which the freshmen became introduced to<br />\nthe ways of Hopkins; it had a purpose.<br />\nThe News-Letter revealed a new perspective which reflected the<br />\nmood of the campus. We became more concerned with the world of<br />\nstudents on this,campus and throughout the nation. The paper slowly<br />\ngrew in scope and size, taking on new responsibilities. The question of<br />\ngovernment research was reopened. This time more people expressed an<br />\nopinion on the subject and the culmination bas been the March 4th<br />\nProtest led by some of our most renowned faculty members and deans.<br />\nThe status of ROTC was brought to question before the entire community<br />\nand its academic credit was removed. Student representation became an<br />\nissue at Hopkins and still remains one. Both graduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents desire a voice in the university. The special subcommittee of the<br />\nAcademic Council which was set up is merely a bone which was thrown<br />\nour way.<br />\nThe Student/Council, after many years of our persistent harping, has<br />\nfinally become the leading organization which it was meant to be. The<br />\nCouncil, in addition to expanding the social schedule, has taken the lead<br />\nin calendar reform at Homewood. It is hoped that their efforts will be<br />\nfruitful in this endeavor. We must, once again, congratulate the Council on<br />\nthe Latin American symposium which it held last December. It has been<br />\nable to partially make up for the shortage of speakers on campus during<br />\nthe past year.

The Student Council used appropriate<br />\nmeans to gain the attention of the faculty and administration and then<br />\nmet in a reasonable manner to discuss the need for action with both<br />\ngroups. The Academic Council responded .by arranging for a full faculty<br />\nmeeting and by promising to support immediate and reasoned action.<br />\nThe responsibility now belongs to the students. They must take the<br />\n.<br />\ninitiative. We urge every student to tell his professors that calendar<br />\nreform, and the 4-1-4 system, in particular, is important to<br />\nundergraduates. In addition, every student should vote in the SC's<br />\nreferendum to prove conclusively to the faculty and administration that<br />\nstudent concern for this issue it real.<br />\nIf the faculty members- see that the majority of students want<br />\ncalendar reform and if they see that the new system would be beneficial<br />\nto the University as a whole, we think that they will respond favorably to<br />\nthe proposals, especially to the 4-1-4 system, when they meet on March<br />\n14th. We urge the Academic Council to follow this meeting with its final<br />\napproval at a special meeting during the following week.

On one level, the connection is obvious:<br />\nGodard's extensive use of the car wreck as background,<br />\nforeground, plot divider and symbol, thus shooting the<br />\nwad of the cinematic bloody pavement motif. Cars are<br />\neverywhere, most of them wrecked. Cars are the world,<br />\nmost of it twisted, flaming bloody.

Permit me to<br />\nobject. Permit me to puke.<br />\nLook, what Godard has done has been to take this<br />\nidea of bloody mechanization (which has roots in not<br />\nmore than half the literature of the twentieth century)<br />\nand add his own limited potpourri of cinematic fetishes<br />\nand social ills.

March 4, 1969 was the centennial of the<br />\ninauguration of Ulysses Simpson Grant as the eighteenth<br />\nPresident of the United States. Mr. Grant's most famous<br />\npostwar statement is \"Let us have peace.\" He did not<br />\nissue this laudable sentiment on March 4. It came at the<br />\nend of his letter accepting the 1868 Republican<br />\nPresidential nomination. This innocuous sentiment is<br />\nfamous because it became a campaign issue. It was<br />\nasserted that Mr. Grant's opponent in the Presidential<br />\ncanvass, Governor Horatio Seymour of New York, in<br />\neffect favored violence, since he had made a speech<br />\nduring the 1863 draft riots and referred to his auditors<br />\nas \"My friends.\" He had not been addressing rioters at<br />\nthe time, but this impression was created by<br />\nRepublicans. Particularly culpable was cartoonist<br />\nThomas Nast, who is best known for more laudable<br />\nenterprises.<br />\nOn March 4, Mr. Grant's banalities could not be<br />\ncontrasted to distortions of the banalities of Governor<br />\nSeymour, but could only fall on their MD weight. I<br />\npresume this is why I detected no interest in<br />\ncommemorating the inaugural. Nevertheless, the balance<br />\nof this piece will proceed on the assumption that the<br />\nGeneral expressed a few thoughts which are worth<br />\nremembering.<br />\nMr. Grant began by expressing confidence in his<br />\nown ability. \"The responsibilities of the position I feel,<br />\nby I accept them without fear.\" It is interesting that Mr.<br />\nGrant was not a dynamic President, but that here he<br />\nindicated a desire to establish a strong position. He<br />\nquickly said that he would make known his opinions to<br />\nCongress. This opened possible vistas. If Mr. Grant spoke<br />\nto congress, he would be the first to do so since John<br />\nAdams. As it happened, the next President to speak to<br />\ncongress was Woodrow Wilson.<br />\nVeto<br />\nHe also made clear that, upon disagreeing with<br />\nCongressional legislation, he would exercise his<br />\nConstitutional privilege of the veto. The growth of the<br />\nexecutive power has been gradual, and in the post-Civil<br />\nWar period it was not to be striking, but this statement<br />\nrepresents a culmination in one area. Twenty-eight years<br />\nbefore President William Henry Harrison, in a speech<br />\nassaulting by implication those powers assumed by<br />\nPresident Jackson, had declared that the veto should be<br />\nrestricted to those occasions when the President<br />\nconsiders the legislation in question unconstitutional.<br />\nMr. Grant gave a \u2022 brief but clear outline of<br />\neconomic policy. He stated that all debts would be paid,<br />\n<br />\nand that he favored the use of specie. There was a<br />\nshortage of it, but he made reference to the \"strong box<br />\nof precious metals\" in \"the sterile mountains of the<br />\nWest\" which he implied had been set aside by<br />\nProvidence to solve this difficulty. It was not then a<br />\nRepublican doctrine that gold was a more desirable<br />\nform of specie than silver. Even as late as 1881,<br />\nPresident Garfield supported active use of both metals in<br />\nfinancial transactions.<br />\nPresident Grant did express the desire for unity<br />\nfollowing the late war. His only reference to the Negro<br />\nwas a wish that the voting question would be solved by<br />\nratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, which shortly<br />\nfollowed. He did not in this speech advocate any changes<br />\nin the Reconstruction legislation as then constituted. It<br />\nmay be added that, had Texas and Virginia been able to<br />\nvote in the 1868 election, Mr. Grant's narrow popular<br />\nvote victory would have been imperilled.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Grant also expressed some interest in Indian<br />\naffairs. He said that he would favor a course leading to<br />\n\"civilization and citizenship\" for the aborigines. No<br />\nimportant legislation on this point was actually passed in<br />\nthe Grant administration, and several Indian wars were<br />\nyet to come.<br />\nIt is evident from his reference to the veto power,<br />\nand his taking a strong stand on economic matters,<br />\nNegro voting and Indian citizenship, that President<br />\nGrant desired to be a reasonably active and strong<br />\nexecutive. He was extremely vague on foreign policy,<br />\nsimply stating that the U.S. cultivated good relations<br />\nwith other powers, and would respond in kind to<br />\nantagonism on the part of others.<br />\nFor no President has the Inaugural Address been a<br />\nmoment of weakness. In the Inaugural the President<br />\ncommands the stage and formulates the dominant ideas.<br />\nAfter this statement of a theory of executive power, the<br />\nnation watched to see if Mr. Grant could translate<br />\ntheory into practice.<br />\n<br />\nSIPS LocalizesCampaign<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nBy STUART SEIDEL<br />\n<br />\nThe Students for a Democratic Society has<br />\nrecently embarked upon action to relieve the<br />\noppressed conditions of the workers at Johns<br />\nHopkins. The adoption of this cause is a<br />\ntremendous improvement over the course that<br />\nSDS took last semester when all attention was<br />\ndevoted to issues removed from the immediate<br />\nenvironment of University life. This apparent<br />\nshift to active concern for what is happening<br />\nclose to home is a welcome relief. They have<br />\nfallen short, however, of touching issues that<br />\npromise to arise the concern and attention of<br />\nthe student body, much less effect them.<br />\nCertainly the dilemma of the University's<br />\nemployees is a very extreme one, but there are just,as<br />\nimportant issues that are presently being dealt with by<br />\nthe students. Matters concerning calendar reform,<br />\ncurriculum changes, class size, coeducation, and grades<br />\nare of far greater interest and importance to the average<br />\nHopkins student than the unfortunate plight of the<br />\nworkingman. SDS, the leading national radical<br />\norganization, has completely overlooked these issues in<br />\nfavor of the adoption of progressive labor type action.<br />\nAs a result to their indifference to these campus issues,<br />\nad hoc committees have developed as well as already<br />\nexisting student organizations, to deal with these<br />\nmatters.<br />\nWhile calendar reform has received widespread<br />\nsupport from the student body, it has received no<br />\n<br />\nattention from SDS. The Student Council, led by Russell<br />\nPassarella and Manuel Rodriquez, has been the only<br />\nfaction on campus to take action to put pressure on the<br />\nfaculty and administration to institute the change.<br />\nNationally, SDS has undertaken a project to<br />\nimprove the conditions of the laborer in American<br />\nsociety. Apparently the Hopkins chapter of the<br />\norganization has adopted the same policy, but what<br />\nremains a significant question is the motivation behind<br />\nthe action. Is there a deep concern for the betterment of<br />\nconditions and salary of the workers, not to mention the<br />\ndemands for an all expenses .paid education for the<br />\nworkers? The first two demands are very reasonable; the<br />\nHopkins employees are far underpaid and the system by<br />\nwhich promotions are determined appears to be quite<br />\ninequitable one, but the demands for free education for<br />\nthe workingman at Hopkins are'unbelievably absurd.<br />\nIrrelevant Voice<br />\nAcross the nation there has been a series of violent<br />\nconfrontations between left-wing students and various<br />\nschool administrations. Here at Hopkins, there have<br />\nobviously been none. SDS at Hopkins has been seeking<br />\nan issue around which there is the possibility of there<br />\nbeing a confrontation, and it is apparent that they are<br />\neager to deal with issues that may bring this about more<br />\nthan issues that \\ire likely to change the institution. This<br />\npolicy is warped, a course of action that would bring<br />\nabout changes that may better the lives of the students<br />\nat Hopkins would prove far more profitable in the long<br />\nrun although it may be less dramatic.<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MARCH 7, 1969<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nBold Knights and Ramses Trojans<br />\nBy CARL JAKOB JOACHIM BENZON<br />\nIn view of the growing<br />\nstudent unrest concerning the<br />\nrelevance of the real world to the<br />\nconcerns of the university I<br />\nthought it might be relevant to<br />\nShow how the real world is indeed<br />\nrelevant to our universal concerns<br />\nand thus give a -point of fixity<br />\nUpon which young and anxious<br />\nnunds can fix their earnest gaze<br />\nand which will serve as a North<br />\nStar by whose light they can chart<br />\ntheir course through the<br />\ntreacherous seas of life.<br />\nAccordingly I have decided to give<br />\na close textual analysis of a rather<br />\nwell known piece of popular verse.<br />\nIn days of old when knights were<br />\nbold,<br />\nAnd rubbers weren't invented,<br />\nThey wrapped a sock<br />\nAround their cock<br />\nAnd Babies were prevented.<br />\nOur first interpretative problem is<br />\nthe matter of textual authentitity.<br />\nWhile popular verse of this sort exists<br />\nPrimarily in a nonlinear aural tradition,<br />\na few texts are available to the intrepid<br />\nscholar who is willing to gird up his<br />\nloins and make a sally into various and<br />\nsundry places for the evacuation of the<br />\nbowels and emptying of the bladder<br />\nOpen to the public.

Until<br />\n1957 A.D. with Special Emphasis on the<br />\nTwenty-Ninth Block on North Calvert<br />\nStreet. by my distinguished colleague<br />\nThomas Aquino Benzon, PH.D., D.<br />\nPhil., F.R.S., F.O.P.<br />\nThis poem is a p.suedolimerick, for<br />\na true limerick has anapestic lines<br />\nrhymed aabba whereas our texts<br />\nconsists of iambs rhymed abccb\u2014though<br />\nthere is internal rhyme in the first line.<br />\nOstensibly it is a comic lyric meant to<br />\nachieve effect by playing on advances in<br />\nthe methods of prophylaxis. However a<br />\nclose reading will reveal that this little<br />\npoem deals with great and weighty<br />\nmatter.<br />\nBoudoir of Truth<br />\nThe key which will unlock the<br />\ndoor which bars our entrance into<br />\nTruth's chamber, the thread which will<br />\nguide us through the labyrinth of<br />\nmultiple meanings, is to be found in the<br />\nword \"rubbers,\" suggesting as it does<br />\nthe everyday world of utility in its<br />\nmeaning gumband or overshoes on the<br />\none hand, and on the other, the<br />\nmeaning obviously intended suggesting<br />\nthe world of sensual pleasure in its<br />\n<br />\nreference to those prophylactic devices<br />\ninvented to prevent the spread of the<br />\ndiseases of Venus. Notice that this<br />\nduality is implicit in the sock used in<br />\ndays of old, for sock is normally worn<br />\non the foot, just as the overshoe can be<br />\n(topologically) transformed into a<br />\nprophylactic device in the service of<br />\nVenus. Thus one of the devices<br />\noperating in this poem is the<br />\ntransformation of the merely utilitarian<br />\ninto the hedonistic. This transformation<br />\nis achieved by the elasticity which is<br />\nimplicit in the notion of rubbers as<br />\ngumbands; it is the elasticity of the<br />\nhuman mind which sees that a sock can<br />\ndo service as a prophylactic device. Thus<br />\nthe transformation of the utilitarian<br />\ninto the hedonistic is effected by the<br />\nhuman imagination seeing a new use in<br />\nan ordinary everyday thing\u2014a sock. It is<br />\nthe call of the hedonistic element in<br />\nman which prompts the imagination to<br />\ninventiveness.<br />\nNew Dimensions<br />\nYet, there is another dimension to<br />\n\"rubbers\" which we must explore.<br />\nRubber only became practical with the<br />\ninvention of vulcanization. This clear<br />\nallusion to Vulcan, the workman of the<br />\ngods, mirrors the allusion to Minerva,<br />\nthe weaver of the gods and therefore<br />\nresponsible for socks. Further, Vulcan<br />\nwas wedded to Venus and cuckolded by<br />\nMars, the god of war and the most<br />\nvainglorious of the gods. This reference<br />\nto Mars clearly mirrors the opening<br />\nmention of knighthood. Thus the folk<br />\ngenius has introduced a clear conflict<br />\nbetween utility and hedonism through<br />\nmythical allusion.<br />\n<br />\nClearly, this folk poem has as its<br />\ntheme the dual nature of creativity and<br />\nimagination, for it was an act of<br />\nimagination which prompted our<br />\nknightly forefathers to the use of the<br />\nsock as a prophylactic device, it was an<br />\nact of imagination which transformed<br />\novershoes into condoms and it was an,<br />\nact of imagination which gave birth to<br />\nthe process of vulcanization which<br />\neffected an improvement upon older<br />\nmethods of prophylaxis. But this<br />\nmagnificent outpouring of imaginative<br />\nactivity was prompted not out of the<br />\nhard working utilitarianism of Vulcan<br />\nbut out of the vainglorious hedonism of<br />\nMars, for the poem explicitly says that<br />\nit was babies which were prevented and<br />\nnot disease. The moral is clear: the<br />\nimagination in service to the<br />\nvainglorious hedonism of Mars can only<br />\nlead to strife and the thwarting of the<br />\nDivinely ordained mode of human<br />\ncreativity, the union of man and woman<br />\nin the creative act to the greater glory of<br />\nGod and the continuation of the<br />\nspecies.<br />\nThus it is clear that the vulgar<br />\nworld is indeed relevant to the sublime<br />\nworld of the university and that the<br />\n\u2022vulgar poets have in fact seen that most<br />\nsublime of truths that Man must live in<br />\nthe light of the Lord and according to<br />\nhis laws and render unto Him his due. If<br />\n\u2022 this is only now coming to light it is<br />\nbecause too few scholars have been<br />\nwilling to place the blubber of folk<br />\npoetry into the try works of the truth<br />\nseeking mind and labor diligently to<br />\nrender forth the pure fat of Divine<br />\ntruth.<br />\n<br />\n11=11M.<br />\n<br />\nA disability has to be treated.<br />\nYou can't kiss it and make it better.<br />\n<br />\nThey say love conquers all.<br />\nWell, it won't conquer a disability.

And Yoko Ono has<br />\nmore than arms over the Venus de<br />\nMilo. At least the cover of \"Two<br />\nVirgins\" (Apple, T5001) is a very<br />\nhuman affair.<br />\nInside, however, the human<br />\nelement is not as obvious. If the<br />\n\"music\" is art, it is \"dehumanized\" art,<br />\nto use Ortega y Gasset's term. It is art<br />\n\"observed\" rather than \"lived,\" for it is<br />\nabstract, impersonal, \"anti-popular,\"<br />\nnon -transcendent, even farcical and<br />\nironic art. It is \"modern\": it does not<br />\nportray life, as Romantic art had done,<br />\nbut it portrays art, for its own sake.<br />\nThat is, if Lennon and Oko have created<br />\nart<br />\nAnd why not? If one accepts a<br />\nPollock painting and a Picasso sculpture,<br />\nFinnegans Wake and Becket's drama,<br />\nthe Boston city hall and Cage's \"music,\"<br />\nnot to mention phantasmagoria in<br />\npoetry and cinema, as art, why not in<br />\nLennon-Ono? Once admitted to the<br />\nprovince of modern art, a phenomenon<br />\none looks at more than empathizes<br />\nwith, the artist's creation then must<br />\nvindicate only its worth, not its<br />\nexistence.<br />\nFor \"dehumanized\" art must be<br />\nviewed and evaluated, not identified<br />\nwith or experienced. This requires<br />\n\"distance,\" as Ortega would demand, an<br />\nobjective abstraction from the<br />\nnonhuman form the artist has chosen.<br />\nThe electronic-cacaphonic music of<br />\n\"Two Virgins\" has refined humanity<br />\nout of the artistic experience, reduced it<br />\nalmost entirely to the levd of mere<br />\nmutterings and simulated human<br />\nsounds. Significantly, the few times a<br />\ndiscernible human element is heard, the<br />\nsurrounding maze of sound disappears,<br />\nor at least it seems that way to the ear<br />\n.seeking human identity. This is as true<br />\nin reading Joyce as it is in listening to<br />\n<br />\n\"Revolution 9\" (which, by the way, is<br />\neven more dehumanized when played<br />\nbackwards).<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIt is perhaps no accident that<br />\ntowards the end of side one on \"Two<br />\nVirgins\" a distinct \"Excuse me. Thank<br />\nyou\" stops the whole melange of noise<br />\nprogression. The human reality has<br />\nintervened, disrupted the concentration<br />\non \"observed\" sound, by compelling<br />\nattention to \"lived\" communication.<br />\nSide two resumes, with few<br />\ninterruptions, the abstraction from the<br />\naudibly intelligible. But this is a<br />\ndisturbing situation, for the human ear<br />\ndies hard, refuses to observe the sound<br />\nit hears, having been trained to live by<br />\naural understanding.<br />\nIf one chooses only to listen<br />\nobjectively, rather than trying to<br />\nidentify on the subjective level, he may<br />\nbe able to appreciate what would<br />\nordinarily be lost in the process of<br />\ngroping for humanization. The title of<br />\n\"Two Virgins\" might then suggest what<br />\nis happening in the music, or trying to<br />\nhappen. Listened to objectively,<br />\nwithout trying to discern rationality,<br />\nthe music has a distinctly \"virginal\"<br />\nquality: its melodies are never<br />\nconsummated, the rhythms never<br />\nfinalized. It remains throughout<br />\nunfulfilled, never climaxed, never<br />\nfertilized, as though the virgins tried and<br />\nfailed, never coming together, so to<br />\nspeak. Bits of melody try to stay erect,<br />\nonly to collapse into weird false starts at<br />\ntonal progressions, a non-coital discord.<br />\nThis is but one interpretation, and even<br />\nthis metaphorical view might negate the<br />\ndehumanized aspect, if that is a. first<br />\npremise.<br />\nGeorge Harrison is more<br />\nhumanized, and his \"Wonderwall<br />\nMusic\" (Apple, ST3350) is to be lived<br />\nand enjoyed. It is an Oriental version of<br />\nwhat the Beatles have been doind for<br />\nmany Occidental years: writing clever,<br />\noriginal tunes. Harrison has produced a<br />\nsequence of classic Eastern<br />\nor<br />\nand exotic solo<br />\nperformances. If Ortega is correct in<br />\nsaying that Oriental tradition has<br />\nstiffled creativity, producing only more<br />\ntradition, this need not detract from the<br />\npure bliss of the cuts on this album.<br />\n<br />\n\"Wonderwall\" (if hyperbole may<br />\nbe excused) is a tour de force of a<br />\ngenius, in the stylistic simplicity of Sgt.<br />\nPepper's Within You/Without You.\"<br />\nThe purely Indian sections are the<br />\nhaunting musical lessons learned at the<br />\nfeet of many masters. Harrison, the<br />\nWestern stranger, has been able to<br />\nintegrate himself fully into the Oriental<br />\nidiom, even introducing Occidental<br />\ninstruments and effects for a flawless<br />\nsynthesis of heritages. Pianos,<br />\nharmonicas, and guitars blend with<br />\nsitars, sur-bahars and table-tarangs to<br />\nexploit traditions of many worlds. Thus,<br />\nHarrison's cobra-charming \"Microbes,\"<br />\nauthentically Indian, blossoms into the<br />\nrag-time of \"Drilling a Home,\" and the<br />\nhome-on-the-Indian-Range frontier<br />\nstrains of \"Cowboy Museum.\"<br />\nThere is little to figure out in<br />\n\"Wonderwall,\" little for the abstract<br />\naesthetician to justify. There is only<br />\nbeautiful, happy, peaceful great, great<br />\nmusic. For those with good speaker<br />\nsystems, the stereo separation is of the<br />\nhighest order. For those with<br />\nheadphones and a psychedelic<br />\n<br />\ninclination, it is head-music of the most<br />\naddictive variety. For the mystic, or just<br />\nthose who want to forget the busy city<br />\nstreet,. \"Singing OM\" is pure nirvana,<br />\nand for the cinema enthusiast, there is<br />\nthe expectation of someday seeing the<br />\nfilm from which the music is taken.<br />\nHarrison and Lennon-Ono are on<br />\nseparate tracks, art as life versus art as<br />\nart. These terms are not mutually<br />\nexclusive, however, sharing the common<br />\nground of aesthetic pleasure, as two<br />\ncreations of variant intentions and<br />\neffects, but each valid in its particular<br />\nmode. Even Ortega was not discarding<br />\nall Romantic art, but merely<br />\ncommenting on the contemporary<br />\ndirection in the arts. Tradition has not<br />\nyet died, be it Indian or English, as the<br />\nBeatles' bank account will readilY<br />\nindicate. Is \"Two Virgins\" a hoax,<br />\nexpensive pornography outside with,<br />\ngarbage inside? Is \"Wonderwall'<br />\ninauthentic, coming out of Liverpool<br />\nand not the Himalayas? Don't worry<br />\nabout that. Just put away the old<br />\nBeatles for a while and try these.

Dr. Allyn<br />\nKimball, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and<br />\nSciences, declared that \"faculty arc hired to<br />\nteach and to do research and whenever we<br />\npromote them we consider his qualifications to<br />\ndo both.<br />\nNeither one is given greater weight by Dean<br />\nKimball because \"a good teacher must be a go od<br />\nresearcher. You can't separate the two because a<br />\nfirst-rate teacher must be acquainted with all<br />\nfrontier areas of work in his field. And the best<br />\nway for a person to be qualified in this sense is<br />\nfor him to be a good researcher himself.\"<br />\nIt was the opinion of all interviewed that<br />\nquantity of publications is not as important as.<br />\ntheir quality. Dr. Richard Macksey, of the<br />\nHumanities Center, averred that Hopkins is<br />\n\"research-oriented but small so that it is not<br />\nquantity oriented.\" Because of this emphasis on<br />\nquality he feels that \"if you print something<br />\ndumb it can come close to costing you your<br />\nhow pervasive<br />\nnegations are in the American<br />\nculture one perceives the true<br />\nmeaning of 'trust no one over<br />\n30.'

However, Dr. Rossi feels that \"a more<br />\nsystematic method of rating teaching ability\" is<br />\nnecessary. \"The students should be the source of<br />\nsuch an evaluation,\" he said. Dr. Rossi cited the<br />\nCourse Guide as a step in the right direction, but<br />\nfelt that it needs greater accuracy in measuring<br />\nstudent opinions.<br />\nPromotion Revision<br />\nBecause Hopkins is a small institution, the<br />\ndepartment chairmen can become closely<br />\nacquainted with the professors under them, and<br />\nhence will be in a better position to evaluate<br />\nperformance than the department chairmen at<br />\nlarge universities. At the larger schools the<br />\npublish or perish rule must be more often relied<br />\nupon.<br />\nLooking into the future Dean Kimball<br />\nwanted to see the divisions of faculty into<br />\nassistant professor, associate professor, and full<br />\nprofessor replaced by a division of tenured and<br />\nuntenured faculty members with salary variations<br />\nin each class. This would ease administrative<br />\nproblems and reduce the number of times the<br />\nprofessor would have to face the major test of<br />\npromotion.<br />\nAs the system exists now an applicant for<br />\nthe post of assistant professor must be approved<br />\nby Dean Kimball and the appropriate department<br />\nchairmen. For promotion to associate professor<br />\nhe must again be approved by Dean Kimball and<br />\nhis department chairman, plus an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee, the Academic Council, and the<br />\nUniversity president.

New outdoor playing space is a<br />\ntremendous problem in the tight urban situation.<br />\nWith the construction of the new<br />\nadministration building the Levering Hall area<br />\nwill be lost to intramurals. A new Playing field<br />\nwill be constructed across San Martin Drive. The<br />\nreport recommends that the present baseball<br />\nfield then be converted to use solely for<br />\nintramurals.<br />\nPhys. Ed. O.K.<br />\npresent<br />\ncompulsory physical education<br />\nThe<br />\nprogram was seen as being basically sound, but in<br />\nneed of some new planning, and its own<br />\nDirector. It was recommended that the term be<br />\ndivided into four quarters. The student should be<br />\nrequired to take one individual sport, a team<br />\nsport, a combative or developmental activity, and<br />\nanother team or individual sport. All those who<br />\ncould not swim 100 yards would have to take a<br />\nquarter of swimming.<br />\nThe committee recommended at least a<br />\n<br />\n30% increase ($90,000) in the departmental<br />\nbudget immediately. This figure does not include<br />\nrecommended capital improvements, or increased<br />\nmaintenance for the athletic center, which will<br />\nprobably add up to several times that amount.<br />\nThe report concludes by making<br />\nrecommendations as to what should be done if<br />\nsufficient funds are not forthcoming. Since the<br />\nathletic program presumes to operate for the<br />\nmaximum benefit of all members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, and since all activities should be<br />\npursued on a first class level or not at all, the<br />\nreport gives a list of those activities which should<br />\nbe the first to go in the event ,that no other<br />\ncourse is left.<br />\nSuch a curtailment must come in<br />\nintercollegiate athletics. Those sports listed as the<br />\nones which should be the first to go because of<br />\ntheir small benefit in relation to cost are (in<br />\norder) baseball, fencing, and cross country track.<br />\nThese curtailments are only recommended<br />\nas a last resort. The committee's final<br />\nrecommendation is that outside consultants be<br />\nhired to give The Department of Physical<br />\nEducation a more thorough going over.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14<br />\n<br />\nHOME WOOD,BALTIMORE, MARCH 7, 196<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nNatators Beat Loyola But Lose to Catholic by Six<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins varsity swimming team<br />\nreached maturity last weekend. Although they<br />\nFinished second to powerful Catholic University<br />\nin the Mason-Dixon championships at Towson<br />\nState, the Jays gave notice that they will be<br />\nFuture champions.<br />\nIn the seven team meet, out of a total of 410 meet<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\npoints, Hopkins captured 126, six less than CU and 371<br />\nin front of third place Loyola. The drubbing of Loyola<br />\nwas especially satisfying since the Hounds had defeated'<br />\nHopkins in an earlier dual meet and were<br />\npre-tournament favorites along with Catholic.<br />\nThe meet, which was not decided until the final<br />\nevent, the 800 free relay, has also made the Jays a<br />\nsomewhat bitter team. Even the most casual observer<br />\ncould not help but feel the animosity that existed<br />\nbetween the old guard coaches from CU, Loyola, and.<br />\nRandolph-Macon and the young first year mentors from<br />\nTowson and Hopkins.<br />\nSince Towson posed no threat to anyone, it<br />\nseemed as if the remaining squads were bent on<br />\npreventing Hopkins from winning. This attitude among<br />\nthe more established schools, particularly Loyola, makes<br />\nperfect sense when one realizes that Hopkins draws<br />\nmany of its students and by consequence swimmers<br />\nfrom Baltimore, Washington, and nearby Virginia.<br />\nThe emergence of a new swimming power in<br />\nMason-Dixon competition, particularly at a school of<br />\nHopkins' educational caliber, has to cut into the<br />\nrecruitment programs of CU, R-M, and Loyola. A strong<br />\n<br />\nteam performance in this first year of Coach Frank<br />\nComfort's reign will be a strong enticement to swimmers<br />\nin the Baltimore and Washington area, and it is quite<br />\nconceivable from the team's growth and performance<br />\nthis season that Hopkins will eventually hold the same<br />\nattraction for Middle Atlantic state swimmers that Yale<br />\nholds for New Englanders although on a necessarily<br />\nsmaller scale.<br />\nThe Jays!performance in the meet itself can only.<br />\nbe described as superb. In nearly every event the<br />\nswimmers produced times drastically lower than those<br />\nshown during the dual meet season. The varsity record<br />\nbook was completely rewritten as 14 new marks were<br />\nset.<br />\nIn addition, Howard Chernick set two conference<br />\nrecords in the 100 and 200 yard butterfly, qualified for<br />\nthe NCAA college division nationals in both events and<br />\nhelped the 400 yd. medley relay (Scott, O'Donnell,<br />\nChernick, Turner) set another conference record.<br />\nThe fourth Hopkins gold medalist was Mike<br />\nO'Donnell in the 200 yd. breaststroke. Other finalists by<br />\nevent included: 1650, 500,\u2022 200 yd. freestyle-Vaughn<br />\nWeikel (2nd, 4th, 2nd); 200, 100 yd. backstroke-Robert<br />\nFisher (5th, 4th) and' Jim Scott (4th, 2nd); 200 yd.<br />\nbreastroke-Joshua Treem (4th); 100 yd. breastroke-Mike<br />\nO'Donnell (2nd) and Rick Ware (3rd); 200, 100 yd.<br />\nbutterfly-Marc Solomon (2nd, 3rd); 100 yd.<br />\nfreestyle-Bryan Turner (4th); 50 yd. freestyle-Bryan<br />\nTurner (5th) and Noel Burnham (6th); 4001M-Rick War<br />\n(4th) and Marc Solomon (6th); 2001M-Rick Ware (2nd)<br />\nand Robert Fisher (4th). In addition to winning the<br />\n<br />\nmedley relay Hopkins placed third in the 400 free relpi<br />\n(Burnham, Ware, Weikel, Turner) and third in the 800<br />\nfree relay (Ware, Fisher, Solomon, Weikel).<br />\n(Continued on page 15)<br />\n<br />\nMARC SOLOMON butterflies his way to a second<br />\nMason-Dixon championships at Towson last week.<br />\n<br />\nThe Teachers!.<br />\n<br />\nX1114<br />\n<br />\n,C11, d 6 41.<br />\nW`..<br />\ns:<br />\n<br />\nTime,is<br />\nCl? inning<br />\nOut...<br />\n<br />\nAs a teacher in New York City, you will be helped by an<br />\noutstanding corps of consultants and school supervisors who have<br />\nbeen carefully selected and trained to give you sympathetic guidance<br />\nand expert<br />\nassistance.

He wrestled Jim King of Western Maryland<br />\nifl his first bout. He had previously pinned King<br />\nin a dual match, but King was ready for Lotto,<br />\nand so was the referee.

Konefal lost to Citro, 16-5;and Citro lost<br />\nhis next match, eliminating Konefal. Carl Betta,<br />\n137 lb., was unable to participate in the<br />\ntournament because he broke his nose in practice<br />\nthe day before the team left for Norfolk.<br />\nnext year's prospects appear to be<br />\nrelatively bright.

This afternoon at the Homewood pool the<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference swimming and diving<br />\nchampionships begin. The Jays will attempt to<br />\nChannel their bitterness and drive into a<br />\nconference crown. Although eleven schools are<br />\nentered the meet appears to be a four team fight<br />\nbetween defending champion Dickinson, which<br />\nIt.as won the crown three years in a row,<br />\nElizabethtown, Drexel, and Hopkins. PMC and<br />\nP8N will also present problems in several events.<br />\nWhile each team may enter as many as four<br />\nswimmers in a single event, there will be no 400<br />\n1650 freestyle, or 800 free relay, all events in<br />\nwhich Hopkins would excel in the MAC. The<br />\nresult is that several Jays will probably double up<br />\n19 events they would not normally swim. The<br />\nlineup also puts a premium on placement and<br />\nstrategy and Coach Comfort has spent many long<br />\nhours poring over times and meet results in an<br />\neffort to outguess his opponents.

Carl is new to<br />\nwrestling and will require a little seasoning, but<br />\nshould develop into a fair wrestler. The 126 lb.<br />\nclass is a question mark. It is hoped that either<br />\nStan Konefal, this year's 130 lb. grappler, or Jeff<br />\nTurshen, the frosh captain and 130 lb., will be<br />\nable to get down to that weight.<br />\nKonefal or Turshen<br />\nor Turshen will wrestle at<br />\nKonefal<br />\nEither<br />\n133 lb. Carl Betta will be trying to maintain his<br />\nposition at 140 lb. against freshman Vernon<br />\nMyers. Jeff Parker will occupy the 147 lb. class,<br />\nhoping to attain a Mason-Dixon title next March,<br />\nespecially in view of the fact that the No. 1 and 2<br />\nwrestlers this year are both seniors.<br />\nThe 154 lb. class should be wide open with<br />\nthe graduation of Monte Ikemire. Eddie Dunbar<br />\ncould win the spot if he devotes the necessary<br />\ntime; but he will be hard pressed by Mike<br />\nErikson, Frank Spellman, and Al Treworgy, all<br />\nfreshman.<br />\nThe fight for the 162 \"lb. spot could<br />\ndevelop into a real battle. Jack Hanemann will<br />\nhave to maintain championship form throughout<br />\nthe season if he hopes to combat freshman Rick<br />\nAlkKenna. McKenna may decide to wrestle at 168<br />\nlb. if his freshman teammate, Nick Pratt, wrestles.<br />\nat 178.<br />\nPratt was undefeated in dual match<br />\ncompetition this year. Bob Hyams may not<br />\nwrestle next year because he will be in<br />\nWashington most of the time. Hyams is in the<br />\nA.B7M.A. program. Junior Fred Ryland will also<br />\nprovide pressing competition for Hanemann<br />\nthroughout the season.<br />\nLotto Back<br />\nJim Lotto will be back at 192 lb. If he is<br />\nable to stay healthy, Lotto will have a good shot<br />\nat the title next March. The title holder and the<br />\nthird place finishers this year are both seniors.<br />\nAt heavyweight, it is a tossup depending on<br />\nwho works hardest during the next seven<br />\nmonths. Marshall Kapp has to develop more of a<br />\nsense of wrestling. Charles Conway, if he is able<br />\nto gain twenty to thirty pounds through weight<br />\nlifting could be quite a heavyweight. Conway<br />\nknows the sport and is just lacking in the<br />\nnecessary bulk and strength. Howard Weaver, by<br />\nfar the strongest freshman on this year's Baby<br />\nJays' squad, will have to learn more<br />\nfundamentals in order to develop into varsity<br />\nmaterial.<br />\nOverall, the Jays will be weak in the very<br />\nlight classes unless Konefal or Turshen can make<br />\nthe weight, and will need help in the heavyweight<br />\nclasses. They should be very strong from<br />\nthirty-three to 192, which will only spell trouble<br />\nfor the Jays' opponents.<br />\nCoach Smith hopes to work next year on<br />\nrolls which the better wrestler employs to the<br />\nmaximum.

The big<br />\ndifference in the Nixon poll is the size of the no opinion<br />\ncategory. Most of the no opinions stated that there has<br />\nbeen no crisis of importance yet to show Nixon's ability<br />\nunder pressure.<br />\nSome of the President's good characteristics were<br />\nhis careful deliberate manner, his cabinet and other<br />\nappointments, his businesslike and efficient approach<br />\nand his Administration's air of calm and dignity. Most<br />\ndisapprovals centered over his personality, lack of Negro<br />\ncabinet and other appointments and the present lack of<br />\nan overall policy statement.<br />\n<br />\nThere are protests and protests. For example, at<br />\nNorth Carolina University, 6 students picketed<br />\nadministration buildings demanding \"equal rights\" and<br />\n\"end of discrimination\" in the employment of blind<br />\nprofessors. The protestors, themselves blind, also<br />\nmockingly requested Braille textbooks for their courses.<br />\nAt Queens College in New York City, the Irish<br />\nRevolutionaries Interested in Scholastic Help (IRISH)<br />\nissued a set of demands to the college, then took over a<br />\nbuilding which houses broom closets and storage rooms<br />\nof broken equipment.<br />\nThe IRISH demands included inception of an<br />\nexchange with the University of Dublin, St. Patrick's<br />\nDay as a legal holiday, formation of a Michael J.

To this end commercialism'<br />\nintercollegiate athletics was eliminated, athler<br />\nscholarships were banned, and no admission was charg<br />\nat any home sports event.<br />\nThe committee agreed that these policies start<br />\nby Dr. Schaffer should be continued with a fel,<br />\nmodifications.

At that<br />\ntime, CAB Examiner Arthur Present attacked<br />\nthe fares as being \"unjustly discriminatory\"<br />\nagainst passengers who are over 21.<br />\nBoth the National Student Marketing Corporation<br />\nand the National Student Association reacted to the<br />\nruling by announcing that they would fight for a<br />\nreversal. A group called Campus Americans for<br />\nDemocratic Action has joined in the protest and all three<br />\ngroups will represent student interests by filing briefs in<br />\nfavor of youth fares at the next CAB hearing on March<br />\n12th.<br />\nCongressional Response<br />\nMembers of Congress have also reacted against the<br />\nproposed ban. At least 16 Representatives, led by Rep.<br /><br />\nArnold Olsen (D. Montana)have introduced a resolution<br />\nin the House supporting the continuation of all children,<br />\nyouth and military fares on domestic airlines. The<br />\nresolution claims that such fares are not inconsistent<br />\nwith the intent and purposes of the Federal Aviation Act<br />\nof 1958 as is claimed by some members of CAB.<br />\nRepresentative James Scheuer (D. New York) has<br />\noffered an amendment to the 1958 Aviation Act that<br />\nwould explicitly give the CAB the right to grant Youth<br />\nFares. Senator Percy of Illinois has introduced a similar<br />\nmeasure in the Senate.<br />\nNo Benefits<br />\nRepresentative Olsen contended that \"No one<br />\nwould benefit from an elimination of these fares. As a<br />\nmatter of fact, it would very likely lead to a general<br />\nincrease in fares because two of the three fare categories<br />\ninvolved apply only to seats which would otherwise go<br />\nvacant.\"<br />\nA group of students on the Hopkins campus has<br />\nalso been involved in fighting the CAB ruling. They<br />\ncollected signatures for a petition from Hopkins,<br />\nTowson State, and Baltimore Junior College. The<br />\npetitions included more than 1300 signatures and they<br />\nwere presented to the CAB this past Wednesday along<br />\nwith petitions from 4000 students from the Washington,<br />\nD.C. area.<br /><br />\nOne student in the Hopkins group said that a<br />\nstudent committee will continue to push for a reversal of<br />\nthe CAB's ruling. The committee hopes to mount a<br />\ncampaign to interest more congressmen in the problem<br />\nand it has urged all Hopkins students to write to their<br />\ncongressmen or at least send them a special Western<br />\nUnion telegram. Since the final decision on youth fares<br />\nhas not been made yet, the committee thinks that there<br />\nis still some chance for incluencing the final outcome.<br />\nThe NSA is willing to go beyond the CAB to keep<br />\nyouth fares alive. The group has retained the services of<br />\na Washington law firm, Koteen and Burt, who are<br />\nexperts in the field of air fares. The group claims that it<br />\nwill take the issue to court if the final CAB ruling is<br />\nunfavorable. The NSA will present oral arguments at the<br />\nupcoming CAB hearings.<br />\nThe NSA position claims that youth fares should<br />\nnot be abolished because they create \"an extraordinary<br />\nopportunity to broaden educational horizons\" by<br />\nbringing air travel within the reach of students for the<br />\nfirst time. Moreover, the NSA claims that the banning of<br />\nyouth fares is being pushed by a special lobby group<br />\nrepresenting the major bus companies of the country.<br /><br />\nHarnik and Drake Elected<br />\nNew Dooks in N-L Vote<br />\nPeter Harnik and Bruce Drake<br />\nwere elected Editors-in-Chief in the<br />\n74th annual News-Letter elections last<br />\nTuesday night.<br />\nDrake, a 20 year old junior from<br />\nEast Rockaway, New York, was<br />\nreelected for a second term of oifice.<br />\nDrake is an English major.<br />\nHarnik, who was Managing Editor<br />\n'during the past year, is a history major<br />\nfrom New York City.

As for the<br />\nbreak-down of the actual time normally<br />\ndevoted by the researcher to military<br />\nresearch, Hamburger felt that it had not<br />\n\"changed significantly.\"<br />\n80% Of His Time<br />\nThe typical researcher working<br />\nunder a military contract devotes 80%<br />\nof HS' time to applied but not<br />\nnecessarily classified research. At least<br />\nhalf of this time is spent on research<br />\nwhich is definitely not classified. The<br />\nother half is directed along more closely<br />\nmilitarily-related topics. Of the<br /><br />\nremaining 20%, 5% of the researchers<br />\ntime is free to work in any area he<br />\ndesires; 15% is devoted to esoteric<br />\nresearch pursuits which would normally<br />\nnot be investigated were it not for the<br />\nmilitary support.<br />\nhamburger indicates that \"If we<br />\nhad our druthers, we would prefer not<br />\nto do any classified research at all.\" He<br />\nfelt, however, that \"for the amount of<br />\nclassified 'research we do, it is a small<br />\nprice to pay for what they pay for basic<br />\nresearch.\" \"It also might be considered<br />\na basic duty of the university to support<br />\nour nation,\" he added.<br />\nMany of the research reports<br />\nwhich are classified are also published in<br />\nslightly bowlderized form for the<br />\ngeneral consumption. What is deleted<br />\nfrom the classified report is a \"military<br />\nrider,\" usually in the form of an<br />\nintroduction, which explains to the<br />\nmilitary the applications of the research<br />\nto their needs. \"It is necessary,\" said<br />\nHamburger, \"that we demonstrate to<br />\nthe military that our basic research can<br />\nbe of use to them; it may happen that<br />\nthe military might not even understand<br />\nthe research that was done.\" He tells the<br />\n, story of one researcher who published<br />\n;the same paper twice, once with a<br />\nmilitary applications introduction, as a<br />\nclassified document, and once as an<br />\nunclassified document with a normal<br />\nintroduction. The only difference<br />\nbetween the two papers was the<br />\nintroduction.<br />\nHamburger, thought, that the<br />\n,<br />\nMilitary applications riders were<br /><br />\nnecessary, since \"the research is<br />\nmilitarily supported.\" The rider allows<br />\nthe researcher to pursue<br />\nbasical-orientated research and still have<br />\nit supported by the military.

Black students across the country have<br />\nused tactics ranging from evacuation of campus to vandalism in order to support and<br />\ndramatize a wide variety of demands.<br />\nDemands<br />\nMost of these demands have<br />\nrevolved around three issues: 1) the<br />\ncreation and autonomy of programs in<br />\nblack studies; 2) university policies for<br />\nadmission of students and hiring of<br />\nfaculty; and 3) alleged discrimination<br />\nagainst black students by faculty and<br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\ncampus police.<br />\nStudents at Brown, the.<br />\nUnder this plan different branches<br />\nUniversities of Wisconsin and North<br />\nof the school, such as the Admissions<br />\nCarolina, the City College of New York,<br />\nOffice and the library, would find room<br />\nand others have demanded programs in<br />\nin their budgets for funding the<br />\nblack studies.

The summer classes were held<br />\nin Gilman Hall and consisted of English<br />\nand Mathmatics, Art, Music, and<br />\nBiology. English and Math were<br />\nrequired for everyone, while Art and<br />\nMusic were each taken by half the<br />\ngroup. A number of students expressed<br />\nan interest in Biology, so a class was<br />\nformed. It was held during the second<br />\nsummer session and was attended by<br />\n15-18 students.<br />\n\"MotivateThese People\"<br />\n,According to Mr. Dates the<br />\npurpose of the Project was \"to motivate<br /><br />\nthese young people to remain in high<br />\nschool and go on to college.\" He felt<br />\nthat the success of the program is<br />\nindicated by the fact that \"a great many<br />\nhave changed their attitudes about going<br />\non to college.\" Of the forty-four<br />\nstudents who entered the program,<br />\nthirty-five plan to go to college<br />\nsomewhere.<br />\nSince the students will be<br />\ngraduating this summer, most of them<br />\nhave already applied to the colleges of<br />\ntheir choice. The University helped<br />\nthem with their choices by giving<br />\ncounseling advice and supplying<br />\ninformation on the various schools. Mr.<br />\nDates said that even though the program<br />\nwas not planned to recruit students for<br />\nHopkins, a number have applied to the<br />\nUniversity, and one has already been<br />\naccepted.<br />\nWhen asked if the Project would<br />\nbe continued with a new group of.<br />\nstudents this summer, Mr. Dates<br />\nanswered that no concrete plans have<br />\nyet been made. The main problem, he<br />\nsaid, is in funding. The first program<br />\nwas wholly financed by the Baltimore<br />\ncity school system, and though there<br />\nhas been a \"favorable reaction from the<br />\nschool system\" over the program, no<br />\nnew funds have been appropriated. Mr.<br />\nDates said that he didn't know if the<br />\ncity schools would make funds available<br />\nfor next year. He also didn't know if<br />\nHopkins would be able to supply any<br />\nmoney to the program.<br />\nWhen asked, if there were any<br />\nplans afoot to include programs such as<br /><br />\nthis in the mini-semester of the new<br />\ncalendar, Mr. Dates said that he hadn't<br />\nthought about it. He did indicate some<br />\npossibilities, however, pointing out that<br />\nsomething of a tutorial nature might be<br />\nworked out between his office and the<br />\nSocial Relations Department or some of<br />\nthe other organizations operating in this<br />\narea.<br /><br />\nVICTOR DATES, Director of Special<br />\nPrograms at Homewood.<br /><br />\nGuess, a leading spokesman for<br />\nBlack students on campus, has<br />\nscheduled a program of Negro<br />\nleaders to speak on Black<br />\nawareness from a Black point of<br />\nview during the coming month.<br />\nThe program, which has been<br />\ncalled Black March, began yesterday<br />\nwith Rev.

Questions such as housing, cost, etc., will be'<br />\nstudies by other groups, probably by those<br />\nadministration agencies already existing.<br />\nHopefully a report will be made in \"the not too<br />\ndistant future,\" according to Carl P. Swanson, Associate<br />\nDean for Undergraduate Studies and chairman of the<br />\nnew committee. Dr. Swanson would like to see the work<br />\nof his board completed for the next Academic Council<br />\nmeeting, on March 26. No extensive research will be<br />\nrequired, as they will be studying the statistics in the<br />\nYale, Princeton, and Franklin and Marshall reports on<br />\ncoeducation.<br />\nBesides Dr. Swanson the committee is composed<br />\nof Director of Admissions William L.

I think that the Council ought to stand on the<br />\ncalendar reform as a whole.\"<br />\nBy a twelve-vote margin, the SC decided to limit<br />\nthe school-wide referendum to the single proposition:<br />\n\"Are you in favor of the 4-1-4 system as submitted by<br />\nDr. Bevan's committee?\"<br />\n4-1-4 Explained<br />\nAccording to the Committee, the 4-1-4 plan<br />\nconsists of \"two 13-14 week semesters separated by a<br />\n4-week, one course, January term in place of the present<br />\nlate-ending academic year of two 16-week semesters.<br />\nThe fall term would begin on either the first or second<br />\nMonday after Dabor Day, depending on whether Labor<br />\nDow was early or late, and would be concluded by<br />\nmid-December.<br />\n\"(The question of optional or mandatory<br />\nenrollment in the January term is a matter to be decided<br />\nby the Dean of Arts and Sciences and his faculty<br />\ncolleagues. Various patterns are possible. One that seems<br />\nreasonable to the present committee would make<br />\nenrollment required of freshmen and sophomores but<br />\nOptional for juniors and seniors).<br />\n\"The fourteen week spring term would begin on<br />\nthe first Monday in February and conclude in mid-May<br />\nafter including a one-week spring vacation scheduled at<br />\nthe end of the 9th week of the term, regardless of the<br />\nproximity of the religious holidays of March and April.\"<br />\nThe Academic Council could decide to implement<br />\nonly part of the suggested reforms for 1969, approve the<br />\ncommittee report as it stands, amend it, or table the<br />\nreport for further action. Any of these moves would<br />\nconstitute the promised \"decision\" on calendar reform.<br />\nHowever, if the entire matter were tabled by the<br />\nAcademic Council, it is improbable that implementation<br />\ncould be achieved in 1969.<br />\nRealizing the urgency of the situation, the Student<br />\nCouncil, last week, sent a letter to President Lincoln<br />\nGordon demanding a \"positive response\" from the<br />\nadministration on the calendar refform question.<br />\nCouncil officers Russ Passarella and Manuel<br />\nRodriguez met with Dr. Gordon for three hours on<br />\nFebruary 25 to discuss the issue at which time Gordon<br />\nagreed to allow the SC to present its demands to the<br />\nAcademic Council on the following afternoon.<br />\nThe Council decided to call a special session of the<br />\nGeneral Faculty Assembly to consider the calendar<br />\nreform proposals, and agreed to settle the entire matter<br />\nby March 26.<br /><br />\nAccording to Dean Swanson \"the students on the<br />\ncommittee will have the responsibility for sampling the<br />\nopinions of the student body.\" Dr. Allyn W. Kimball,<br />\nDean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, believes that<br />\nknowledge of undergraduate viewpoints is essential<br />\nbefore coeducation can be taken before the General<br />\nAssembly of the faculty. Rudoy stated that a<br />\nreferendum will probably be held after the committee<br />\ndelivers its report.<br />\nIf the new committee recommends that<br />\ncoeducation was academically desirable and feasible,<br />\nthen the next step would be ratification by the General<br />\nAssembly of the faculty. Last month they approved the<br />\nprinciple of coeducation, but no specific mention of<br />\nHopkins was made.<br />\nConsent Of Trustees<br />\nAfter the General Assembly, coeducation would<br />\nhave to be approved by the Academic Council, the<br />\n16-man board which determines major University policy.<br />\nNext, President Lincoln Gordon and the administration<br />\nwould have to consider the question. After that stage the<br />\nconsent of the trustees would most likely be required,<br /><br />\nalthough formal channels of approval are somewhat<br />\nuncertain, as there is no precedent for such a significant<br />\nchange in the University structure.<br />\n\"The main obstacle to coeducation is the cost,\"<br />\ndeclared Dean Kimball. Practical and economic<br />\ndifficulties, such as housing and facilities, would have to<br />\nbe solved by the administration, who would ultimately<br />\ndecide if enough funds were available for the project.<br />\nBut Dean Kimball believes that \"by and large you find<br />\nthe administration to be quite favorable to this.\"<br />\nInvestigation of coeducation really began in 1964<br />\nin some subcommittees of the Long Range Planning<br />\nCommittee, a two-year study. The question also came up<br />\nin consideration of the proposed School of Allied Health<br />\nSciences.<br />\nNo formal discussions on coeducation were held<br />\nsince that time, until this February.

Harvard and Radcliffe<br />\nare now considering a full merger which might include<br />\nexperimental coed dorms. Elmira College in New York<br />\nwill admit men to its full time program for the first time<br />\nin 114 years this fall.<br />\nThe students want coeducation so that \"the<br />\n\u2022<br />\nmale-female relationship will be taken out of the<br />\nabsurdly pressured situation of the weekend date. A lot<br />\nof guys think of women as objects, or dumb broads, but<br />\nthey're human beings too.\" as Aviam Soifer,the head of<br />\nYale's Coeducation Week, stated. Administrators are<br />\nattracted to coeducation because they feel that it would<br />\nattract more students and therefore more money to the<br />\ncampuses. However, Arthur J. Horton, director of<br />\ndevelopment at Princeton and sole dissenter from the<br />\nconclusions of the Patterson committee report, stated<br />\nthat coeducation could \"have a damaging effect on our<br />\noverall fund raising efforts. In fact, I fear that there will<br />\nbe alumni who, liking the university as an all male<br />\n;institution, could lose much of their present ardor.\"<br /><br />\nThe decision of Yale to admit women<br />\nundergraduates next fall is indicative of a<br />\ngrowing movement toward coeducation.<br /><br />\nBreaking its 267 year tradition Yale will have 500<br />\nundergraduate women on campus this fall. The Yale<br />\nmove was made in response to what Yale president<br />\nKingman Brewster, Jr. called,\"The very high motivation<br />\nand energetic responsibility of the present Yale<br />\nstudents.\" An example of this motivation was the<br />\nCoeducation Week, sponsored by the undergraduate<br />\nbody during the first week of last November. 700 girls<br />\nfrom 22 eastern colleges participated in the program,<br />\nattending classes and meals with boys and living in their<br />\nrooms, vacated for the week..<br />\nMoves toward coeducation have also been made by<br />\nPrinceton. A study presented to University president<br />\nRobert Goheen by Dr. Gardner Patterson, professor of<br />\nEconomics at Princeton, stated that coeducation would<br />\n\"greatly enrich the cultural and social life of students<br />\nand would tend to develop in undergraduates a sense of<br />\nresponsibility toward one another. We believe that for<br />\nPrinceton to remain an all male institution in the face of<br />\ntoday's evolving social system would be out of keeping<br />\nwith her past willingness to change with the times.\"<br />\nThe study estimated that the addition of 1000<br />\ncoeds to the Princeton student body would swell<br />\noperating expenses by $300,000 and additional capital<br />\ncosts would total $25 million.

Perhaps one may<br />\nconclude that the content of black activism has<br />\nrelatively little significance. Psychologist William<br />\nBlanchard suggested this recently in the Los<br />\nAngeles Times:<br />\n\"The black man pauses with Molotov<br />\ncocktail poised. Wh*at is this cat saying? Did the<br />\nAmerican revolutionists write their Constitution<br />\nbefore they declared their independence from<br />\nEngland? Did they sit down and prepare a<br />\ndetailed set of programs,'reasonable alternatives'<br />\nor did they simply tell the British to get off their<br />\nback?<br />\n\"Well, all right, if he wants a program we'll<br />\ngive him one: 'we want a black studies<br />\ndepartment in every university, with all black<br />\nprofessors and full decision power on admission<br />\nto the department vested in black people. How<br />\nabout that for a program? Now let's get on with<br />\nthe revolution....<br /><br />\nKerr's response to the open admission demand is<br />\ntypical: \"They're not qualified. It would lower<br />\nour standards...\"<br />\nResponse<br />\nThe favored response to the problem is<br />\nremedial training to \"bring them up to the<br />\ncollege level.\" Many of the schools at which<br />\nthese programs are in operation have been the<br />\nscenes of the loudest black student protest (i.e.<br />\nUniversity of lllinois, Queens College, NYU...).<br />\nStudents in such programs often feel that they<br />\nare just being told again that they are inferior,<br />\nand sense waves of condescension from<br />\nadministrators and other students. And the<br />\ndemand fro a say in the running of the program<br />\nseldom fails to appear.<br /><br />\n\"Under such circumstances it is easier to<br />\ntake the bait of the black studies department ane<br />\nchew it as though we believe it is the real meat of<br />\nthe problem. For if we raise our eyes to the real<br />\nissues they become too frightening to<br />\ncontemplate.\"<br /><br />\nChanging educational institutions, reason<br />\nSan Francisco State strike leaders, does not mean<br />\n\"lowering\"\u2014it can mean \"broadening\" to include<br />\nmore life styles and other education demands<br />\nthan those of the children of the white rich. If<br />\nuniversities cannot reach and communicate with<br />\n, America's subcultures and minorities they don't<br />\ndeserve to survive. Hence the demand for open<br />\nblack admissions.<br /><br />\nStrong Commitment<br />\nOther demands of black students have<br />\nreflected a strong commitment to the progress of<br />\ntheir community. A committee of students from<br />\nNew York's Hunter College barged into a faculty<br />\nmeeting and demanded that they be excused<br />\nfrom their courses and given credit for teaching<br />\nghetto pupils during the teacher's strike. CCNY<br />\nblack students joined with Puerto Rican students<br />\nin demanding that Spanish be made a<br />\nrequirement for education majors.<br /><br />\nThe Kent State University black<br />\ncommunity evacuated campus to press their<br />\ndemand that \"racist\" Oakland police not be<br />\nallowed to recruit. San Fernando State activists<br />\noccupied the administration building demanding<br />\nthe dismissal of a coach who struck a black<br />\nstudent. University of Massachusetts student<br />\ntook a building demanding the appointment of<br />\nNegro policemen and the firing of two officers<br />\nwho stood by passively while white students beat<br />\nup a \"brother\".<br /><br />\nAnd of course, the demand that more and<br />\nmore blacks be admitted to universities has been<br />\nraised by students at San Francisco State, CCNY,<br />\nBrandeis, Swarthmore, Duke, and the University<br />\nof Wisconsin. The cry of open admission for<br />\nblack students is increasingly heard. Black<br />\nactivists acknowledge that most colleges are<br />\nfinally aware that it is both desirable and<br />\nnecessary to change their racial and economic<br />\nmake up. The question is how to do it. Clark<br /><br />\nThe list is endless and diverse. The<br />\ncommon thread running through the demands of<br />\nblack students across the country is that they are<br />\ndemands\u2014one no longer hears of protests. And<br />\nthe common problem faced by college presidents<br />\nis that of dealing with a small minority with a<br />\nhistory of oppression, issuing demands for<br />\nimmediate change, and willing to disrupt<br />\nuniversity activity and face administrative<br />\nsanction in the fight for change.<br /><br />\nOCCASION EXTRAORDINARY OR JUST<br />\nANY OCCASION-LET US INSURE<br />\nTHE SUCCESS<br /><br />\nEDDIE'S GOURMET SHOPPE<br />\n3109 ST.

Together with the<br />\nNon-Communist Manifesto of<br />\nWalt Rostow, the resolution of<br />\nthe Student Council will be<br />\nremembered by posterity as one<br />\nof the great documents of the<br />\n20th Century. Nevertheless, I shall<br />\ntake the liberty to add a few<br />\ncomments.<br />\nThe Student Council<br />\ncertainly represents the \"vast<br />\nconsensus of the undergraduate<br />\nstudent body\" as far as calendar<br />\nreform in general is concerned,<br />\nbut the current discussion<br />\ncompletely ignores that solutions<br />\nother than a 4-1-4 system are<br />\npossible. The report of the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee recommends the 4-1-4<br />\nplan, but this does not oblige<br />\nanyone, least of all the students,<br />\nto agree.<br />\nDespite all the interesting<br />\nand often idealistic proposals, it<br />\nseems that no one has the slightest<br />\nidea about what should go on<br />\nduring the mini-semester. Small<br />\nclasses are a brilliant, though not<br />\nexactly new, idea, but it is<br />\ndoubtful that the faculty-student<br />\nratio will improve, as if by<br />\nmagic, as soon as the new plan<br />\ngoes into effect. If it does<br />\nimprove, why not maintain it for<br />\nthe rest of the year? As for<br />\nindependent study, there are<br />\nmany opportunities under the<br />\ncurrent system. For those juniors<br />\nand seniors who do not attend (if<br />\nthey are given this option), the<br />\nmini-semester would be a waste of<br />\ntime which could be used more<br />\nproductively in summer. Besides,<br />\nit is not clear why freshmen and<br />\nsophomores should be subject to<br />\ndiscrimination.<br />\nBut all these arguments<br />\nprobably _ did not concern the<br />\ncommittee anyway. In an attempt<br />\nto find a compromise between the<br />\nmedical institutions, various other<br />\nBaltimore colleges, and student<br />\ndemands, the committee hit upon<br />\na solution which can hardly stand<br />\non its own merits. I hope that the<br />\nalternatives, such as a plan with<br />\ntwo semesters and a<br />\nMay-to-August vacation, or a<br />\nTrimester system like Goucher's,<br />\nwill be considered again whet% the<br />\ndust has settled somewhat.<br />\nMeanwhile, I recommend<br />\nthat the Student Council think<br />\ntwice before it generously dispense<br />\nstrike threats to all corners. The<br />\nstudents are not prepared to<br />\nfollow their leaders unless they<br />\nare directly consulted, and the<br />\nadministration is not deeply<br />\nimpressed by threats unless the<br />\nstudent body is really prepared to<br />\ntake action. A dual credibility gap<br />\nshould be avoided by all means, or<br />\nelse we ,shall soon have occasion<br />\nto see a few lonely members of<br />\nthe Student Council stand on the<br /><br />\nsteps of -Gilman Hall,<br />\nself-consciously waving a strike<br />\nplacard, while faculty and<br />\nstudents attend their classes and a<br />\nchoir of administration officials<br />\nlaughs in the background.<br />\nDaniel Niehans '71<br /><br />\nCIVILIZING EFFECT<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was very interested in Dr.<br />\nRobert A. Gordon's letter which<br />\nappeared in last week's issue. I<br />\nagree wholeheartedly with Dr.<br />\nGordon's criticism of the<br />\nproposed ABM system, but I must<br />\ntake issue with his evaluation of<br />\ncivilian participation in military<br />\nresearch as a \"civilianizing\" effect<br />\non the military.<br />\nTo make my point, let's go<br />\nback to the late 40's and early<br />\n5 O's, when such civilian<br />\nparticipation was envisioned as a<br />\ncheck on the military. At that<br />\ntime, I would imagine, the liberals<br />\nof the day recognized the need for<br />\nmassive defense expenditures to<br />\nprotect your country, but at the<br />\nsame time envisioned civilian<br />\nparticipation as the sort of thing<br />\nthat would prevent incidents like<br />\nVietnam and the Dominican<br />\nRepublic, bloated defense<br />\nbudgets, war and peacetime<br />\nprofiteering, etc. Well, it didn't,<br />\nand the reason for failure is very<br />\nsimple: the military was never the<br />\nproblem! The problem is the<br />\nAmerican corporation, the same<br />\n\"civilian\" institution which<br />\nwound up controlling the military<br />\nresearch. After all, it is the<br />\ncorporations which benefit the<br />\nmost from big defense budgets<br />\nand big armies to protect their<br />\nvast foreign holdings; so<br />\nconsequently, one can hardly<br />\nhope for a civilizing influence<br />\nfrom such quarters.<br />\nThe radicals of today are<br />\nrefusing to be co-opted by<br />\ninstitutions which claim to be<br />\n\"public,\" \"civilian,\" and all that<br />\njazz, but which are in reality<br />\nundemocratic, monopolistic<br />\nmanipulators. If we really want<br />\ncivilian control over the military,<br />\nthen what we need are civilian<br />\ninstitutions whose actions are<br />\nguided by the needs of society<br />\nrather than personal profit.<br />\nIn my view, the military is<br />\nby and large the handmaid of the<br />\ncorporations, and is subordinate<br />\nto the ends of capitalism. We are<br />\nnow in a period of rampant<br />\nimperialism, an imperialism which<br />\ncan make was on an<br />\nunderdeveloped country to secure<br />\nthe great tin and tungsten supplies<br />\nso \"necessary\" to our already<br />\nover-producing economy. So<br />\nnaturally, I think it makes sense<br />\nto confront the handmaid when it<br />\nappears as ROTC on campus,<br />\nGrumman Aircraft in the<br />\ncomputing center or APL in Silver<br />\nSpring, Md.<br />\nFrank Munley<br />\nGraduate Student<br /><br />\nTHE CATHOLIC commumrf<br />\nON CAMPUS<br />\nSUNDAY<br /><br />\nMARCH 9th<br /><br />\n10:30 A.M.<br /><br />\nMULTI -MEDIA MASS<br /><br />\nShaffer Hall Rm.3<br />\n111\u2022111.1=<br /><br />\nWeekday IVIass - 12:05 P.M. - Levering Chapel<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MARCH 7,1969<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\n\"MY MOTHER SAYS MY BROTHER IS IN JAIL<br />\nFOR BURNING BUILDINGS IN WASHINGTON!\"<br /><br />\nJust The Beginning<br />\nA year has passed, a year which has seen this school and this entire<br />\nnation awaken to the existence of students. A year which has witnessed<br />\nthe coronation of Nixon and the abdication of Lyndon. Spiro Agnew,<br />\nformerly of Maryland, now presides over the Senate, while everyone prays<br />\nfor the safety of the President. Robert Kennedy has joined his brother on<br />\nthat quiet knoll in Arlington, Virginia. The analysis of the Kerner report,<br />\nof a nation divided into two separate societies, becomes more of a truism<br />\nas black and white daily confront each other as enemies and not brothers.<br />\nAnd, of course, the immoral war goes on in Southeast Asia while the<br />\ndiplomats play games in Paris.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nWe began with McCarthy's victory in New Hampshire, an incident<br />\nwhich foretold the beginnings of a unique student movement. Martin<br />\nLuther King was murdered last April and the summer riots erupted three<br />\nmonths earlier than predicted. The disturbances in Baltimore were mild in<br />\ncomparison to Washington. Emerging from Dr. King's death was a new<br />\nattitude on the part of students and universities in regard to relationships<br />\nWith the urban community. Hopkins has taken its first step in this<br />\ndirection in the establishment of an Urban Center, increased tutorial<br />\nprojects, and greater health care for the residents of East Baltimore.<br />\nWhile the rest of the country was worrying about the riots and the<br />\nwar, Hopkins students continued to show almost no interest in the outside<br />\nworld. We won another lacrosse championship with Joe Cowan leading the<br />\nBlue Jays, while the peace talks got underway in France. Then the<br />\nsummer came and the conventions overshadowed everything else. The<br />\nmighty hand of Mayor Daley was felt throughout the country as his<br />\ncharges used gestapo tactics to put down the demonstrators at the<br />\nDemocratic fiasco in Chicago. Returning to Hopkins after four months,<br />\none could sense a new feeling in the air, one which seemed to breathe of<br />\nconcern on the part of this student body. Orientation set the scene for<br />\nthis change on the formerly placid campus of Homewood. No longer was<br />\nit merely a period of gaiety in which the freshmen became introduced to<br />\nthe ways of Hopkins; it had a purpose.<br />\nThe News-Letter revealed a new perspective which reflected the<br />\nmood of the campus. We became more concerned with the world of<br />\nstudents on this,campus and throughout the nation. The paper slowly<br />\ngrew in scope and size, taking on new responsibilities. The question of<br />\ngovernment research was reopened. This time more people expressed an<br />\nopinion on the subject and the culmination bas been the March 4th<br />\nProtest led by some of our most renowned faculty members and deans.<br />\nThe status of ROTC was brought to question before the entire community<br />\nand its academic credit was removed. Student representation became an<br />\nissue at Hopkins and still remains one. Both graduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents desire a voice in the university. The special subcommittee of the<br />\nAcademic Council which was set up is merely a bone which was thrown<br />\nour way.<br />\nThe Student/Council, after many years of our persistent harping, has<br />\nfinally become the leading organization which it was meant to be. The<br />\nCouncil, in addition to expanding the social schedule, has taken the lead<br />\nin calendar reform at Homewood. It is hoped that their efforts will be<br />\nfruitful in this endeavor. We must, once again, congratulate the Council on<br />\nthe Latin American symposium which it held last December. It has been<br />\nable to partially make up for the shortage of speakers on campus during<br />\nthe past year.

The Student Council used appropriate<br />\nmeans to gain the attention of the faculty and administration and then<br />\nmet in a reasonable manner to discuss the need for action with both<br />\ngroups. The Academic Council responded .by arranging for a full faculty<br />\nmeeting and by promising to support immediate and reasoned action.<br />\nThe responsibility now belongs to the students. They must take the<br />\n.<br />\ninitiative. We urge every student to tell his professors that calendar<br />\nreform, and the 4-1-4 system, in particular, is important to<br />\nundergraduates. In addition, every student should vote in the SC's<br />\nreferendum to prove conclusively to the faculty and administration that<br />\nstudent concern for this issue it real.<br />\nIf the faculty members- see that the majority of students want<br />\ncalendar reform and if they see that the new system would be beneficial<br />\nto the University as a whole, we think that they will respond favorably to<br />\nthe proposals, especially to the 4-1-4 system, when they meet on March<br />\n14th. We urge the Academic Council to follow this meeting with its final<br />\napproval at a special meeting during the following week.

Weekend wasn't good because<br />\nit was pompous, the \"movie from a scrapheap\" shit<br />\nflashed on the opening credits being the first clue to its<br />\npompousness. Weekend became, in all its flashy glitter,<br />\nthe dull prostitution of a world view already set in the<br />\nminds of those capable of seeing it in the film. Imagery<br />\nis shallow, technical work compatible with the plot:<br />\nmediocre. For Godard, the art is tortured. For a viewer<br />\nnot willing to masturbate enthusiasm for an \"art film\",<br />\nthe movie was gross yet every bit as dull as the<br />\nnon-existant highpoint of the boredom scene.<br /><br />\nOur American Heritage,<br /><br />\nDid You Celebrate This Occasion?<br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nA centennial has passed, and members of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins community should be cognizant of the<br />\nfact. March 4, 1969 was the centennial of the<br />\ninauguration of Ulysses Simpson Grant as the eighteenth<br />\nPresident of the United States. Mr. Grant's most famous<br />\npostwar statement is \"Let us have peace.\" He did not<br />\nissue this laudable sentiment on March 4. It came at the<br />\nend of his letter accepting the 1868 Republican<br />\nPresidential nomination. This innocuous sentiment is<br />\nfamous because it became a campaign issue. It was<br />\nasserted that Mr. Grant's opponent in the Presidential<br />\ncanvass, Governor Horatio Seymour of New York, in<br />\neffect favored violence, since he had made a speech<br />\nduring the 1863 draft riots and referred to his auditors<br />\nas \"My friends.\" He had not been addressing rioters at<br />\nthe time, but this impression was created by<br />\nRepublicans. Particularly culpable was cartoonist<br />\nThomas Nast, who is best known for more laudable<br />\nenterprises.<br />\nOn March 4, Mr. Grant's banalities could not be<br />\ncontrasted to distortions of the banalities of Governor<br />\nSeymour, but could only fall on their MD weight. I<br />\npresume this is why I detected no interest in<br />\ncommemorating the inaugural. Nevertheless, the balance<br />\nof this piece will proceed on the assumption that the<br />\nGeneral expressed a few thoughts which are worth<br />\nremembering.<br />\nMr. Grant began by expressing confidence in his<br />\nown ability. \"The responsibilities of the position I feel,<br />\nby I accept them without fear.\" It is interesting that Mr.<br />\nGrant was not a dynamic President, but that here he<br />\nindicated a desire to establish a strong position. He<br />\nquickly said that he would make known his opinions to<br />\nCongress. This opened possible vistas. If Mr. Grant spoke<br />\nto congress, he would be the first to do so since John<br />\nAdams. As it happened, the next President to speak to<br />\ncongress was Woodrow Wilson.<br />\nVeto<br />\nHe also made clear that, upon disagreeing with<br />\nCongressional legislation, he would exercise his<br />\nConstitutional privilege of the veto. The growth of the<br />\nexecutive power has been gradual, and in the post-Civil<br />\nWar period it was not to be striking, but this statement<br />\nrepresents a culmination in one area. Twenty-eight years<br />\nbefore President William Henry Harrison, in a speech<br />\nassaulting by implication those powers assumed by<br />\nPresident Jackson, had declared that the veto should be<br />\nrestricted to those occasions when the President<br />\nconsiders the legislation in question unconstitutional.<br />\nMr. Grant gave a \u2022 brief but clear outline of<br />\neconomic policy. He stated that all debts would be paid,<br /><br />\nand that he favored the use of specie. There was a<br />\nshortage of it, but he made reference to the \"strong box<br />\nof precious metals\" in \"the sterile mountains of the<br />\nWest\" which he implied had been set aside by<br />\nProvidence to solve this difficulty. It was not then a<br />\nRepublican doctrine that gold was a more desirable<br />\nform of specie than silver. Even as late as 1881,<br />\nPresident Garfield supported active use of both metals in<br />\nfinancial transactions.<br />\nPresident Grant did express the desire for unity<br />\nfollowing the late war. His only reference to the Negro<br />\nwas a wish that the voting question would be solved by<br />\nratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, which shortly<br />\nfollowed. He did not in this speech advocate any changes<br />\nin the Reconstruction legislation as then constituted. It<br />\nmay be added that, had Texas and Virginia been able to<br />\nvote in the 1868 election, Mr. Grant's narrow popular<br />\nvote victory would have been imperilled.<br /><br />\nMr. Grant also expressed some interest in Indian<br />\naffairs. He said that he would favor a course leading to<br />\n\"civilization and citizenship\" for the aborigines. No<br />\nimportant legislation on this point was actually passed in<br />\nthe Grant administration, and several Indian wars were<br />\nyet to come.<br />\nIt is evident from his reference to the veto power,<br />\nand his taking a strong stand on economic matters,<br />\nNegro voting and Indian citizenship, that President<br />\nGrant desired to be a reasonably active and strong<br />\nexecutive. He was extremely vague on foreign policy,<br />\nsimply stating that the U.S. cultivated good relations<br />\nwith other powers, and would respond in kind to<br />\nantagonism on the part of others.<br />\nFor no President has the Inaugural Address been a<br />\nmoment of weakness. In the Inaugural the President<br />\ncommands the stage and formulates the dominant ideas.<br />\nAfter this statement of a theory of executive power, the<br />\nnation watched to see if Mr. Grant could translate<br />\ntheory into practice.<br /><br />\nSIPS LocalizesCampaign<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nBy STUART SEIDEL<br /><br />\nThe Students for a Democratic Society has<br />\nrecently embarked upon action to relieve the<br />\noppressed conditions of the workers at Johns<br />\nHopkins. The adoption of this cause is a<br />\ntremendous improvement over the course that<br />\nSDS took last semester when all attention was<br />\ndevoted to issues removed from the immediate<br />\nenvironment of University life. This apparent<br />\nshift to active concern for what is happening<br />\nclose to home is a welcome relief. They have<br />\nfallen short, however, of touching issues that<br />\npromise to arise the concern and attention of<br />\nthe student body, much less effect them.<br />\nCertainly the dilemma of the University's<br />\nemployees is a very extreme one, but there are just,as<br />\nimportant issues that are presently being dealt with by<br />\nthe students. Matters concerning calendar reform,<br />\ncurriculum changes, class size, coeducation, and grades<br />\nare of far greater interest and importance to the average<br />\nHopkins student than the unfortunate plight of the<br />\nworkingman. SDS, the leading national radical<br />\norganization, has completely overlooked these issues in<br />\nfavor of the adoption of progressive labor type action.<br />\nAs a result to their indifference to these campus issues,<br />\nad hoc committees have developed as well as already<br />\nexisting student organizations, to deal with these<br />\nmatters.<br />\nWhile calendar reform has received widespread<br />\nsupport from the student body, it has received no<br /><br />\nattention from SDS. The Student Council, led by Russell<br />\nPassarella and Manuel Rodriquez, has been the only<br />\nfaction on campus to take action to put pressure on the<br />\nfaculty and administration to institute the change.<br />\nNationally, SDS has undertaken a project to<br />\nimprove the conditions of the laborer in American<br />\nsociety. Apparently the Hopkins chapter of the<br />\norganization has adopted the same policy, but what<br />\nremains a significant question is the motivation behind<br />\nthe action. Is there a deep concern for the betterment of<br />\nconditions and salary of the workers, not to mention the<br />\ndemands for an all expenses .paid education for the<br />\nworkers? The first two demands are very reasonable; the<br />\nHopkins employees are far underpaid and the system by<br />\nwhich promotions are determined appears to be quite<br />\ninequitable one, but the demands for free education for<br />\nthe workingman at Hopkins are'unbelievably absurd.<br />\nIrrelevant Voice<br />\nAcross the nation there has been a series of violent<br />\nconfrontations between left-wing students and various<br />\nschool administrations. Here at Hopkins, there have<br />\nobviously been none. SDS at Hopkins has been seeking<br />\nan issue around which there is the possibility of there<br />\nbeing a confrontation, and it is apparent that they are<br />\neager to deal with issues that may bring this about more<br />\nthan issues that \\ire likely to change the institution. This<br />\npolicy is warped, a course of action that would bring<br />\nabout changes that may better the lives of the students<br />\nat Hopkins would prove far more profitable in the long<br />\nrun although it may be less dramatic.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MARCH 7, 1969<br /><br />\nPAGE 9<br /><br />\nBold Knights and Ramses Trojans<br />\nBy CARL JAKOB JOACHIM BENZON<br />\nIn view of the growing<br />\nstudent unrest concerning the<br />\nrelevance of the real world to the<br />\nconcerns of the university I<br />\nthought it might be relevant to<br />\nShow how the real world is indeed<br />\nrelevant to our universal concerns<br />\nand thus give a -point of fixity<br />\nUpon which young and anxious<br />\nnunds can fix their earnest gaze<br />\nand which will serve as a North<br />\nStar by whose light they can chart<br />\ntheir course through the<br />\ntreacherous seas of life.<br />\nAccordingly I have decided to give<br />\na close textual analysis of a rather<br />\nwell known piece of popular verse.<br />\nIn days of old when knights were<br />\nbold,<br />\nAnd rubbers weren't invented,<br />\nThey wrapped a sock<br />\nAround their cock<br />\nAnd Babies were prevented.<br />\nOur first interpretative problem is<br />\nthe matter of textual authentitity.<br />\nWhile popular verse of this sort exists<br />\nPrimarily in a nonlinear aural tradition,<br />\na few texts are available to the intrepid<br />\nscholar who is willing to gird up his<br />\nloins and make a sally into various and<br />\nsundry places for the evacuation of the<br />\nbowels and emptying of the bladder<br />\nOpen to the public.

However a<br />\nclose reading will reveal that this little<br />\npoem deals with great and weighty<br />\nmatter.<br />\nBoudoir of Truth<br />\nThe key which will unlock the<br />\ndoor which bars our entrance into<br />\nTruth's chamber, the thread which will<br />\nguide us through the labyrinth of<br />\nmultiple meanings, is to be found in the<br />\nword \"rubbers,\" suggesting as it does<br />\nthe everyday world of utility in its<br />\nmeaning gumband or overshoes on the<br />\none hand, and on the other, the<br />\nmeaning obviously intended suggesting<br />\nthe world of sensual pleasure in its<br /><br />\nreference to those prophylactic devices<br />\ninvented to prevent the spread of the<br />\ndiseases of Venus. Notice that this<br />\nduality is implicit in the sock used in<br />\ndays of old, for sock is normally worn<br />\non the foot, just as the overshoe can be<br />\n(topologically) transformed into a<br />\nprophylactic device in the service of<br />\nVenus. Thus one of the devices<br />\noperating in this poem is the<br />\ntransformation of the merely utilitarian<br />\ninto the hedonistic. This transformation<br />\nis achieved by the elasticity which is<br />\nimplicit in the notion of rubbers as<br />\ngumbands; it is the elasticity of the<br />\nhuman mind which sees that a sock can<br />\ndo service as a prophylactic device. Thus<br />\nthe transformation of the utilitarian<br />\ninto the hedonistic is effected by the<br />\nhuman imagination seeing a new use in<br />\nan ordinary everyday thing\u2014a sock. It is<br />\nthe call of the hedonistic element in<br />\nman which prompts the imagination to<br />\ninventiveness.<br />\nNew Dimensions<br />\nYet, there is another dimension to<br />\n\"rubbers\" which we must explore.<br />\nRubber only became practical with the<br />\ninvention of vulcanization. This clear<br />\nallusion to Vulcan, the workman of the<br />\ngods, mirrors the allusion to Minerva,<br />\nthe weaver of the gods and therefore<br />\nresponsible for socks. Further, Vulcan<br />\nwas wedded to Venus and cuckolded by<br />\nMars, the god of war and the most<br />\nvainglorious of the gods. This reference<br />\nto Mars clearly mirrors the opening<br />\nmention of knighthood. Thus the folk<br />\ngenius has introduced a clear conflict<br />\nbetween utility and hedonism through<br />\nmythical allusion.<br /><br />\nClearly, this folk poem has as its<br />\ntheme the dual nature of creativity and<br />\nimagination, for it was an act of<br />\nimagination which prompted our<br />\nknightly forefathers to the use of the<br />\nsock as a prophylactic device, it was an<br />\nact of imagination which transformed<br />\novershoes into condoms and it was an,<br />\nact of imagination which gave birth to<br />\nthe process of vulcanization which<br />\neffected an improvement upon older<br />\nmethods of prophylaxis. But this<br />\nmagnificent outpouring of imaginative<br />\nactivity was prompted not out of the<br />\nhard working utilitarianism of Vulcan<br />\nbut out of the vainglorious hedonism of<br />\nMars, for the poem explicitly says that<br />\nit was babies which were prevented and<br />\nnot disease. The moral is clear: the<br />\nimagination in service to the<br />\nvainglorious hedonism of Mars can only<br />\nlead to strife and the thwarting of the<br />\nDivinely ordained mode of human<br />\ncreativity, the union of man and woman<br />\nin the creative act to the greater glory of<br />\nGod and the continuation of the<br />\nspecies.<br />\nThus it is clear that the vulgar<br />\nworld is indeed relevant to the sublime<br />\nworld of the university and that the<br />\n\u2022vulgar poets have in fact seen that most<br />\nsublime of truths that Man must live in<br />\nthe light of the Lord and according to<br />\nhis laws and render unto Him his due. If<br />\n\u2022 this is only now coming to light it is<br />\nbecause too few scholars have been<br />\nwilling to place the blubber of folk<br />\npoetry into the try works of the truth<br />\nseeking mind and labor diligently to<br />\nrender forth the pure fat of Divine<br />\ntruth.<br /><br />\n11=11M.<br /><br />\nA disability has to be treated.<br />\nYou can't kiss it and make it better.<br /><br />\nThey say love conquers all.<br />\nWell, it won't conquer a disability.

And Yoko Ono has<br />\nmore than arms over the Venus de<br />\nMilo. At least the cover of \"Two<br />\nVirgins\" (Apple, T5001) is a very<br />\nhuman affair.<br />\nInside, however, the human<br />\nelement is not as obvious. If the<br />\n\"music\" is art, it is \"dehumanized\" art,<br />\nto use Ortega y Gasset's term. It is art<br />\n\"observed\" rather than \"lived,\" for it is<br />\nabstract, impersonal, \"anti-popular,\"<br />\nnon -transcendent, even farcical and<br />\nironic art. It is \"modern\": it does not<br />\nportray life, as Romantic art had done,<br />\nbut it portrays art, for its own sake.<br />\nThat is, if Lennon and Oko have created<br />\nart<br />\nAnd why not? If one accepts a<br />\nPollock painting and a Picasso sculpture,<br />\nFinnegans Wake and Becket's drama,<br />\nthe Boston city hall and Cage's \"music,\"<br />\nnot to mention phantasmagoria in<br />\npoetry and cinema, as art, why not in<br />\nLennon-Ono? Once admitted to the<br />\nprovince of modern art, a phenomenon<br />\none looks at more than empathizes<br />\nwith, the artist's creation then must<br />\nvindicate only its worth, not its<br />\nexistence.<br />\nFor \"dehumanized\" art must be<br />\nviewed and evaluated, not identified<br />\nwith or experienced. This requires<br />\n\"distance,\" as Ortega would demand, an<br />\nobjective abstraction from the<br />\nnonhuman form the artist has chosen.<br />\nThe electronic-cacaphonic music of<br />\n\"Two Virgins\" has refined humanity<br />\nout of the artistic experience, reduced it<br />\nalmost entirely to the levd of mere<br />\nmutterings and simulated human<br />\nsounds. Significantly, the few times a<br />\ndiscernible human element is heard, the<br />\nsurrounding maze of sound disappears,<br />\nor at least it seems that way to the ear<br />\n.seeking human identity. This is as true<br />\nin reading Joyce as it is in listening to<br /><br />\n\"Revolution 9\" (which, by the way, is<br />\neven more dehumanized when played<br />\nbackwards).<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIt is perhaps no accident that<br />\ntowards the end of side one on \"Two<br />\nVirgins\" a distinct \"Excuse me. Thank<br />\nyou\" stops the whole melange of noise<br />\nprogression. The human reality has<br />\nintervened, disrupted the concentration<br />\non \"observed\" sound, by compelling<br />\nattention to \"lived\" communication.<br />\nSide two resumes, with few<br />\ninterruptions, the abstraction from the<br />\naudibly intelligible. But this is a<br />\ndisturbing situation, for the human ear<br />\ndies hard, refuses to observe the sound<br />\nit hears, having been trained to live by<br />\naural understanding.<br />\nIf one chooses only to listen<br />\nobjectively, rather than trying to<br />\nidentify on the subjective level, he may<br />\nbe able to appreciate what would<br />\nordinarily be lost in the process of<br />\ngroping for humanization. The title of<br />\n\"Two Virgins\" might then suggest what<br />\nis happening in the music, or trying to<br />\nhappen. Listened to objectively,<br />\nwithout trying to discern rationality,<br />\nthe music has a distinctly \"virginal\"<br />\nquality: its melodies are never<br />\nconsummated, the rhythms never<br />\nfinalized. It remains throughout<br />\nunfulfilled, never climaxed, never<br />\nfertilized, as though the virgins tried and<br />\nfailed, never coming together, so to<br />\nspeak. Bits of melody try to stay erect,<br />\nonly to collapse into weird false starts at<br />\ntonal progressions, a non-coital discord.<br />\nThis is but one interpretation, and even<br />\nthis metaphorical view might negate the<br />\ndehumanized aspect, if that is a. first<br />\npremise.<br />\nGeorge Harrison is more<br />\nhumanized, and his \"Wonderwall<br />\nMusic\" (Apple, ST3350) is to be lived<br />\nand enjoyed. It is an Oriental version of<br />\nwhat the Beatles have been doind for<br />\nmany Occidental years: writing clever,<br />\noriginal tunes. Harrison has produced a<br />\nsequence of classic Eastern<br />\nor<br />\nand exotic solo<br />\nperformances. If Ortega is correct in<br />\nsaying that Oriental tradition has<br />\nstiffled creativity, producing only more<br />\ntradition, this need not detract from the<br />\npure bliss of the cuts on this album.<br /><br />\n\"Wonderwall\" (if hyperbole may<br />\nbe excused) is a tour de force of a<br />\ngenius, in the stylistic simplicity of Sgt.<br />\nPepper's Within You/Without You.\"<br />\nThe purely Indian sections are the<br />\nhaunting musical lessons learned at the<br />\nfeet of many masters. Harrison, the<br />\nWestern stranger, has been able to<br />\nintegrate himself fully into the Oriental<br />\nidiom, even introducing Occidental<br />\ninstruments and effects for a flawless<br />\nsynthesis of heritages. Pianos,<br />\nharmonicas, and guitars blend with<br />\nsitars, sur-bahars and table-tarangs to<br />\nexploit traditions of many worlds. Thus,<br />\nHarrison's cobra-charming \"Microbes,\"<br />\nauthentically Indian, blossoms into the<br />\nrag-time of \"Drilling a Home,\" and the<br />\nhome-on-the-Indian-Range frontier<br />\nstrains of \"Cowboy Museum.\"<br />\nThere is little to figure out in<br />\n\"Wonderwall,\" little for the abstract<br />\naesthetician to justify. There is only<br />\nbeautiful, happy, peaceful great, great<br />\nmusic. For those with good speaker<br />\nsystems, the stereo separation is of the<br />\nhighest order. For those with<br />\nheadphones and a psychedelic<br /><br />\ninclination, it is head-music of the most<br />\naddictive variety. For the mystic, or just<br />\nthose who want to forget the busy city<br />\nstreet,. \"Singing OM\" is pure nirvana,<br />\nand for the cinema enthusiast, there is<br />\nthe expectation of someday seeing the<br />\nfilm from which the music is taken.<br />\nHarrison and Lennon-Ono are on<br />\nseparate tracks, art as life versus art as<br />\nart. These terms are not mutually<br />\nexclusive, however, sharing the common<br />\nground of aesthetic pleasure, as two<br />\ncreations of variant intentions and<br />\neffects, but each valid in its particular<br />\nmode. Even Ortega was not discarding<br />\nall Romantic art, but merely<br />\ncommenting on the contemporary<br />\ndirection in the arts. Tradition has not<br />\nyet died, be it Indian or English, as the<br />\nBeatles' bank account will readilY<br />\nindicate. Is \"Two Virgins\" a hoax,<br />\nexpensive pornography outside with,<br />\ngarbage inside? Is \"Wonderwall'<br />\ninauthentic, coming out of Liverpool<br />\nand not the Himalayas? Don't worry<br />\nabout that. Just put away the old<br />\nBeatles for a while and try these.

In his opinion \"powerful people<br />\nend up doing what they please anyway,\" and this<br />\nundermines the value of rational discourse. He stated<br />\nthat all significant changes in universities have come<br />\nsit-ins and demonstrations. \"The universities<br />\n\u2022tluough<br />\nhave taken advantage of academic freedom and<br />\nneutrality- to serve the established class interests and to<br />\nserve the military,\" he said.<br /><br />\nDr.<br /><br />\nBradley believes that the reason why<br />\nare used by the military for research work is<br />\ntheir already available and concentrated facilities and<br />\n\"their<br />\nknowledge.\" In this situation the contractors have<br />\ncontrol over what the contractees do,for \"the scientists<br />\nhave no control over the<br />\nproducts of their work, nor<br />\ndoes the university, nor does the<br />\ncommunity,\" according<br />\nto Dr.<br />\nBradley.<br /><br />\nPoor Performances<br />\nHalstead analysed and rebutted the arguments in<br />\nfavor of the ABM. lie said that \"its performance is very<br />\nuncertain,\" and that decoy missiles could easily deceive<br />\nits radar. \"During World War 11 if 100 bombers flew over<br />\nLondon and 20 were shot down, thart pretty good.

Dr. Allyn<br />\nKimball, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and<br />\nSciences, declared that \"faculty arc hired to<br />\nteach and to do research and whenever we<br />\npromote them we consider his qualifications to<br />\ndo both.<br />\nNeither one is given greater weight by Dean<br />\nKimball because \"a good teacher must be a go od<br />\nresearcher. You can't separate the two because a<br />\nfirst-rate teacher must be acquainted with all<br />\nfrontier areas of work in his field. And the best<br />\nway for a person to be qualified in this sense is<br />\nfor him to be a good researcher himself.\"<br />\nIt was the opinion of all interviewed that<br />\nquantity of publications is not as important as.<br />\ntheir quality. Dr. Richard Macksey, of the<br />\nHumanities Center, averred that Hopkins is<br />\n\"research-oriented but small so that it is not<br />\nquantity oriented.\" Because of this emphasis on<br />\nquality he feels that \"if you print something<br />\ndumb it can come close to costing you your<br />\nhow pervasive<br />\nnegations are in the American<br />\nculture one perceives the true<br />\nmeaning of 'trust no one over<br />\n30.'

However, Dr. Rossi feels that \"a more<br />\nsystematic method of rating teaching ability\" is<br />\nnecessary. \"The students should be the source of<br />\nsuch an evaluation,\" he said. Dr. Rossi cited the<br />\nCourse Guide as a step in the right direction, but<br />\nfelt that it needs greater accuracy in measuring<br />\nstudent opinions.<br />\nPromotion Revision<br />\nBecause Hopkins is a small institution, the<br />\ndepartment chairmen can become closely<br />\nacquainted with the professors under them, and<br />\nhence will be in a better position to evaluate<br />\nperformance than the department chairmen at<br />\nlarge universities. At the larger schools the<br />\npublish or perish rule must be more often relied<br />\nupon.<br />\nLooking into the future Dean Kimball<br />\nwanted to see the divisions of faculty into<br />\nassistant professor, associate professor, and full<br />\nprofessor replaced by a division of tenured and<br />\nuntenured faculty members with salary variations<br />\nin each class. This would ease administrative<br />\nproblems and reduce the number of times the<br />\nprofessor would have to face the major test of<br />\npromotion.<br />\nAs the system exists now an applicant for<br />\nthe post of assistant professor must be approved<br />\nby Dean Kimball and the appropriate department<br />\nchairmen. For promotion to associate professor<br />\nhe must again be approved by Dean Kimball and<br />\nhis department chairman, plus an ad hoc<br />\ncommittee, the Academic Council, and the<br />\nUniversity president.

Needless to say, he was once again<br />\nnamed most valuable wrestler.<br />\nJeff Parker had the misfortune of suffering<br />\na bad head cold which slowed him down slightly<br />\nand hindered his breathing. Parker defeated his<br />\nfirst opponent, Newton of Towson,8-6.<br />\nHe lost to Jim Collins of Baltimore<br />\nUniversity, 2-0. Collins lost in the finals to David<br />\nLinkhjem of OD, 4-2. Parker defeated Jatho of<br />\nGallaudet, 10-3, and pinned Angelo Chiarvallo of<br />\nCatholic University in 4:44 for third place.<br />\nIkemire Hurting<br />\nMonte lkemire had missed three straight<br />\ndual matches because of an ankle injury and was<br />\nnot in top shape for the tournament. Ikemire<br />\nfaced Gilpin of Baltimore University in his first<br />\nmatch and wrestled extremely well despite the<br />\ninjury. Twice, however, the B.U. opponent<br />\nscored points with less than five seconds<br />\nremaining in the particular period. lkemire lost<br />\n8-6.<br />\nHe then faced Mansfield of OD and<br />\nwrestled what has to be his best and smartest<br />\nmatch ever. The OD foe had an amazing vvizzer;<br />\nbut Ikemire was able to counter it and took<br />\nMansfield down. Ikemire went on to win that<br />\nmatch, 3-1. In the Consolation Finals, the<br />\nHopkins grappler won by forfeit when Spradlin<br />\nof Lynchburg College was unable to wrestle.<br />\nBob Hyams, described as \"near brilliant at<br />\ntimes\" in this article two weeks ago, proved<br />\nalmost that, Ilyams has one of the most<br /><br />\nunorthodox styles ever to be used on the mat,<br />\nbut it wins for him. Hyams defeated Zick of<br />\nWestern Maryland in his first match, 21-2.<br />\nHe lost his next match against the eventual<br />\nwinner, Kiggerel of OD, by the score of 22-5.<br />\nHyams was the only foe who ICiggerel couldn't<br />\npin. Hyams then soundly defeated Ellis of<br />\nGallaudet by the score of 9-0; and beat George<br />\nLoose of Loyola in the Consolation Finals,13-1.<br />\nBad Luck For Peck<br />\nJohn Peck, wrestling at 167 lb., ran into a<br />\ngood deal of bad luck. The senior grappler had<br />\nthe misfortune of having to wrestle two matches<br />\nin less than two hours on Friday afternoon. Peck<br />\nwon the first \u2022against Anderson of Baltimore<br />\nUniversity, 5-2, but lost to Borum of OD,8-5.<br />\nPeck was obviously the better wrestler, but<br />\nthe Blue Jay didn't have any strength left by the<br />\nthird period of the 2nd match.

The increasing<br />\nhours of the center were seen as a step in the<br />\nright direction. New outdoor playing space is a<br />\ntremendous problem in the tight urban situation.<br />\nWith the construction of the new<br />\nadministration building the Levering Hall area<br />\nwill be lost to intramurals. A new Playing field<br />\nwill be constructed across San Martin Drive. The<br />\nreport recommends that the present baseball<br />\nfield then be converted to use solely for<br />\nintramurals.<br />\nPhys. Ed. O.K.<br />\npresent<br />\ncompulsory physical education<br />\nThe<br />\nprogram was seen as being basically sound, but in<br />\nneed of some new planning, and its own<br />\nDirector. It was recommended that the term be<br />\ndivided into four quarters. The student should be<br />\nrequired to take one individual sport, a team<br />\nsport, a combative or developmental activity, and<br />\nanother team or individual sport. All those who<br />\ncould not swim 100 yards would have to take a<br />\nquarter of swimming.<br />\nThe committee recommended at least a<br /><br />\n30% increase ($90,000) in the departmental<br />\nbudget immediately. This figure does not include<br />\nrecommended capital improvements, or increased<br />\nmaintenance for the athletic center, which will<br />\nprobably add up to several times that amount.<br />\nThe report concludes by making<br />\nrecommendations as to what should be done if<br />\nsufficient funds are not forthcoming. Since the<br />\nathletic program presumes to operate for the<br />\nmaximum benefit of all members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, and since all activities should be<br />\npursued on a first class level or not at all, the<br />\nreport gives a list of those activities which should<br />\nbe the first to go in the event ,that no other<br />\ncourse is left.<br />\nSuch a curtailment must come in<br />\nintercollegiate athletics. Those sports listed as the<br />\nones which should be the first to go because of<br />\ntheir small benefit in relation to cost are (in<br />\norder) baseball, fencing, and cross country track.<br />\nThese curtailments are only recommended<br />\nas a last resort. The committee's final<br />\nrecommendation is that outside consultants be<br />\nhired to give The Department of Physical<br />\nEducation a more thorough going over.<br /><br />\nPAGE 14<br /><br />\nHOME WOOD,BALTIMORE, MARCH 7, 196<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nNatators Beat Loyola But Lose to Catholic by Six<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins varsity swimming team<br />\nreached maturity last weekend. Although they<br />\nFinished second to powerful Catholic University<br />\nin the Mason-Dixon championships at Towson<br />\nState, the Jays gave notice that they will be<br />\nFuture champions.<br />\nIn the seven team meet, out of a total of 410 meet<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\npoints, Hopkins captured 126, six less than CU and 371<br />\nin front of third place Loyola. The drubbing of Loyola<br />\nwas especially satisfying since the Hounds had defeated'<br />\nHopkins in an earlier dual meet and were<br />\npre-tournament favorites along with Catholic.<br />\nThe meet, which was not decided until the final<br />\nevent, the 800 free relay, has also made the Jays a<br />\nsomewhat bitter team. Even the most casual observer<br />\ncould not help but feel the animosity that existed<br />\nbetween the old guard coaches from CU, Loyola, and.<br />\nRandolph-Macon and the young first year mentors from<br />\nTowson and Hopkins.<br />\nSince Towson posed no threat to anyone, it<br />\nseemed as if the remaining squads were bent on<br />\npreventing Hopkins from winning. This attitude among<br />\nthe more established schools, particularly Loyola, makes<br />\nperfect sense when one realizes that Hopkins draws<br />\nmany of its students and by consequence swimmers<br />\nfrom Baltimore, Washington, and nearby Virginia.<br />\nThe emergence of a new swimming power in<br />\nMason-Dixon competition, particularly at a school of<br />\nHopkins' educational caliber, has to cut into the<br />\nrecruitment programs of CU, R-M, and Loyola. A strong<br /><br />\nteam performance in this first year of Coach Frank<br />\nComfort's reign will be a strong enticement to swimmers<br />\nin the Baltimore and Washington area, and it is quite<br />\nconceivable from the team's growth and performance<br />\nthis season that Hopkins will eventually hold the same<br />\nattraction for Middle Atlantic state swimmers that Yale<br />\nholds for New Englanders although on a necessarily<br />\nsmaller scale.<br />\nThe Jays!performance in the meet itself can only.<br />\nbe described as superb. In nearly every event the<br />\nswimmers produced times drastically lower than those<br />\nshown during the dual meet season. The varsity record<br />\nbook was completely rewritten as 14 new marks were<br />\nset.<br />\nIn addition, Howard Chernick set two conference<br />\nrecords in the 100 and 200 yard butterfly, qualified for<br />\nthe NCAA college division nationals in both events and<br />\nhelped the 400 yd. medley relay (Scott, O'Donnell,<br />\nChernick, Turner) set another conference record.<br />\nThe fourth Hopkins gold medalist was Mike<br />\nO'Donnell in the 200 yd. breaststroke. Other finalists by<br />\nevent included: 1650, 500,\u2022 200 yd. freestyle-Vaughn<br />\nWeikel (2nd, 4th, 2nd); 200, 100 yd. backstroke-Robert<br />\nFisher (5th, 4th) and' Jim Scott (4th, 2nd); 200 yd.<br />\nbreastroke-Joshua Treem (4th); 100 yd. breastroke-Mike<br />\nO'Donnell (2nd) and Rick Ware (3rd); 200, 100 yd.<br />\nbutterfly-Marc Solomon (2nd, 3rd); 100 yd.<br />\nfreestyle-Bryan Turner (4th); 50 yd. freestyle-Bryan<br />\nTurner (5th) and Noel Burnham (6th); 4001M-Rick War<br />\n(4th) and Marc Solomon (6th); 2001M-Rick Ware (2nd)<br />\nand Robert Fisher (4th). In addition to winning the<br /><br />\nmedley relay Hopkins placed third in the 400 free relpi<br />\n(Burnham, Ware, Weikel, Turner) and third in the 800<br />\nfree relay (Ware, Fisher, Solomon, Weikel).<br />\n(Continued on page 15)<br /><br />\nMARC SOLOMON butterflies his way to a second<br />\nMason-Dixon championships at Towson last week.<br /><br />\nThe Teachers!.<br /><br />\nX1114<br /><br />\n,C11, d 6 41.<br />\nW`..<br />\ns:<br /><br />\nTime,is<br />\nCl? inning<br />\nOut...<br /><br />\nAs a teacher in New York City, you will be helped by an<br />\noutstanding corps of consultants and school supervisors who have<br />\nbeen carefully selected and trained to give you sympathetic guidance<br />\nand expert<br />\nassistance.

Eddie Dunbar<br />\ncould win the spot if he devotes the necessary<br />\ntime; but he will be hard pressed by Mike<br />\nErikson, Frank Spellman, and Al Treworgy, all<br />\nfreshman.<br />\nThe fight for the 162 \"lb. spot could<br />\ndevelop into a real battle. Jack Hanemann will<br />\nhave to maintain championship form throughout<br />\nthe season if he hopes to combat freshman Rick<br />\nAlkKenna.

Marshall Kapp has to develop more of a<br />\nsense of wrestling. Charles Conway, if he is able<br />\nto gain twenty to thirty pounds through weight<br />\nlifting could be quite a heavyweight. Conway<br />\nknows the sport and is just lacking in the<br />\nnecessary bulk and strength. Howard Weaver, by<br />\nfar the strongest freshman on this year's Baby<br />\nJays' squad, will have to learn more<br />\nfundamentals in order to develop into varsity<br />\nmaterial.<br />\nOverall, the Jays will be weak in the very<br />\nlight classes unless Konefal or Turshen can make<br />\nthe weight, and will need help in the heavyweight<br />\nclasses. They should be very strong from<br />\nthirty-three to 192, which will only spell trouble<br />\nfor the Jays' opponents.<br />\nCoach Smith hopes to work next year on<br />\nrolls which the better wrestler employs to the<br />\nmaximum.

His failure to<br />\n\"clean house\" in the Slate Department, his decision to<br />\nend patronage in the appointment of postmasters, his<br />\nlack of consultation with Republicans on appointments<br />\nand his designations of the \"left-wing Democratic<br />\nCharles Yost\" as ambassador to the United Nations and<br />\nof James Allen, Jr. as commissioner of education were<br />\ndecried.<br />\nThe publication accused Nixon of only rearranging<br />\ngovernment posts instead of wholescale shuffling.

Opponents of the bill have argued that teen-agers<br />\nand 20-year-olds generally are not mature and<br />\nresponsible enough to vote. Others said they feared<br />\ninclusion of the measure on the ballot might endanger<br />\nmore important constitutional amendments expected to<br />\nbe put before the voters.<br />\nOne delegate stated, \"If we were able to teach<br />\nthem how to vote as well as we teach them how to fight,<br />\nthere might be some validity.\"<br /><br />\nHarvard Concurs<br />\nHarvard University welcomed Tuesday the request<br />\nof Radcliffe College for a merger between the two<br />\ninstitutions and suggested it could be accomplished by<br />\nthe fall of 1970.<br />\nThe Harvard Corporation, their governing body,<br />\nmet this morning to consider the request, made nine<br />\ndays ago when the Radcliffe Council voted to press for a<br />\nfull merger with Harvard. The letter to Radcliffe's<br />\npresident said, \"In principle, we welcome the prospect<br />\nof a merger and are grateful to the Radcliffe Council for<br />\ninitiating the question.

The big<br />\ndifference in the Nixon poll is the size of the no opinion<br />\ncategory. Most of the no opinions stated that there has<br />\nbeen no crisis of importance yet to show Nixon's ability<br />\nunder pressure.<br />\nSome of the President's good characteristics were<br />\nhis careful deliberate manner, his cabinet and other<br />\nappointments, his businesslike and efficient approach<br />\nand his Administration's air of calm and dignity. Most<br />\ndisapprovals centered over his personality, lack of Negro<br />\ncabinet and other appointments and the present lack of<br />\nan overall policy statement.<br /><br />\nThere are protests and protests. For example, at<br />\nNorth Carolina University, 6 students picketed<br />\nadministration buildings demanding \"equal rights\" and<br />\n\"end of discrimination\" in the employment of blind<br />\nprofessors. The protestors, themselves blind, also<br />\nmockingly requested Braille textbooks for their courses.<br />\nAt Queens College in New York City, the Irish<br />\nRevolutionaries Interested in Scholastic Help (IRISH)<br />\nissued a set of demands to the college, then took over a<br />\nbuilding which houses broom closets and storage rooms<br />\nof broken equipment.<br />\nThe IRISH demands included inception of an<br />\nexchange with the University of Dublin, St. Patrick's<br />\nDay as a legal holiday, formation of a Michael J.
