Immediately following is a pleasant interlude of tap dancing, and then<br />\nwe find ourselves in the Governor's<br />\nmansion.

And so runs the<br />\nwhole play, packed with wit, songs,<br />\nand lively dances.<br />\nThe best scene of the show has as<br />\nlocale a graveyard, with Gertrude<br />\nStein reciting her poetry over the<br />\ngrave of Edgar Allen Poe. Awakened<br />\nby the noise, Poe demands to know<br />\nwhat Miss Stein is saying, and they<br />\nget to quareling, when in walks Syd-<br /><br />\nney Lanier. To make a foursome,<br />\nOgden Nash enters and the ensuing<br />\ndialogue has to be heard to be enjoyed.<br />\nA close runner-up for first honors,<br />\nis the scene which is evidently in the<br />\nOriole Restaurant. A song depicting<br />\nthe hardships of the traybearer,<br />\ncoupled with clever acting, and the<br />\ninsistent demand of \"I want ice<br />\ncream,\" made by the girl with the<br />\nlong hair, produce the most humorous and witty scenes I've witnessed in<br />\na long time.<br />\nAmong other scenes are portrayals<br />\nof Washington at \"Valley George,\"<br />\n\"Quest for Literature,\" which is a<br />\nburlesque of an hour at Pratt Library,<br />\nand a \"Directors' Conference\" which<br />\nshould quicken the pulses and hearts<br />\nof many a Hopkins student.
