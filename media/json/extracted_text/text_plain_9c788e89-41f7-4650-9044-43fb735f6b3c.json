This year's budget<br />\ncreated a deficit of over $2.1<br />\nmillion.<br />\n\"We had hoped to cut that<br />\ndeficit to $1 million or just<br />\nbelow,\" Muller said. \"The reasons we weren't successful are all<br />\ntoo obvious.

The<br />\nreal increase was only about 2%\"<br />\nThe savings which made this<br />\nlow budget rise possible were<br />\nlargely achieved through the<br />\nefforts of a study committee<br />\nheaded by Budget Director<br />\nNorm Kreuger.

Ono<br />\n<br />\nRequire Tongues Opinion<br />\nNext week, the various committees currently undertaking a review of the curriculum at Hopkins will turn<br />\ntheir attention to area and departmental requirements at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Two things, however, need to be not<br />\nspecific departmental but general prerequisites for any<br />\nundergraduate who obtains a diploma here.<br />\n'One major activity young people engage in while<br />\nobtaining a University education is organizing their<br />\nthoughts along novel conceptual frameworks. These<br />\nframeworks, like Marxism for example, can be quite<br />\nprofound in scope, and frequently they contrast with or<br />\ncontradict the frameworks people have been accustomed<br />\nto in a way which provides a very valuable perspective.<br />\nThinking according to such a new perspective allows us to<br />\nsee how the assumptions we have .grown up with have<br />\nshaped to a surprising extent the way we perceive events<br />\nand conditions in the external world.<br />\nThe framework which affects both the broadest<br />\nportion of our lives and at the same time incorporates the<br />\nmost specific conceptual units necessary for thought is our<br />\nlanguage. No idea can take shape even in our minds, much<br />\nless in our speech. without words. So it follows that for an<br />\neducated person it is most essential to be able to stand<br />\naside for a moment and take a look at the linguistic<br />\nframework that has molded him. The best available means<br />\nfor doing so is to learn and employ a second language.<br />\nSuccessful completion of at least an elementary-level<br />\ncourse in some language should therefore be made a<br />\ncompulsory requirement for undergraduates at Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThere is another reason why a general foreign language<br />\nrequirement should be instituted. All too many Americans.<br />\nincluding even the majority of college graduates, remain<br />\nignorant of the rich cultural heritage to which we are heir,<br />\na heritage largely shaped on the continent of Europe<br />\nand the sands of the Near East. They are too often unaware and seemingly uninterested in the dramatic events<br />\nwhich unfold even today outside the borders of the U.S. A<br />\ngraduate of a first-rate American institution of higher<br />\nlearning should be capable of rising above this general tide<br />\nof ignorance. A Hopkins graduate should at least possess<br />\nsome level of competency in a foreign language. Such<br />\ncompetency is an absolute minimum tool necessary ,for a<br />\nperson to achieve a sufficient level of culture and cosmopolitanism to be described by the term \"educated.\"<br />\nAt the same time, another language requirement of a<br />\nvery different nature should be instituted. All students<br />\nshould be required to demonstrate some minimum level of<br />\nproficiency in a computer language.<br />\nComputers are constanth becoming more important in<br />\nour society. Almost no field of endeavor is immune to the<br />\nimprovements which can be effected through their use. So<br />\nthe ability to work with computers is valuable no matter<br />\nwhat career a person may ultimately follow, and just like<br />\nknowing a foreign language it is important for an educated<br />\nadult in the 1980's to possess.<br />\nLike foreign languages, computer languages are an<br />\nalternative to the conceptual framework employed in the<br />\nEnglish language. They are much easier to learn than<br />\nforeign languages, and while they are structured similarly<br />\nto English (so are the Romance and Teutonic languages,<br />\nfor that matter), they are different enough to make<br />\nlearning one a worthwhile intellectual exercise in itself.<br />\nEngineering, mathematics, and science-oriented students<br />\nwill undoubtedly gripe if a foreign language requirement is<br />\ninstituted, and many humanistic area majors will be even<br />\nmore upset about the prospect of having to take a computer course. But the curriculum reviewers should plot<br />\na course designed to truly _educate Hopkins undergraduates. even against their present-day wills.<br />\n<br />\nNuke Non-Necessity<br />\nBY JOHN GUNN<br />\n<br />\nThe editorial \"Nuke Necessity\" expresses quite succinctly<br />\nsome common misconceptions<br />\nand antiquated notions apparently held by too many Americans. Underlying the editorial<br />\nwas the assumption that the U.S.<br />\neconomy must continue to<br />\ngrow, consuming more and more<br />\nenergy in the process, in order to<br />\nsurvive.

Without huge<br />\nfederal expenditures in nuclear<br />\nenergy research and development in the '50s and '60s, a time<br />\nwhen the U.S. energy outlook<br />\nwas fairly stable, there would be<br />\nno commercial nuclear energy<br />\nin the U.S. today.<br />\n(In 1953 the Atomic Energy<br />\nCommission, which at that time<br />\nwas solely in the business<br />\nof weapons production,employed 5% of the U.S. construction<br />\nlabor force and consumed 10%<br />\nof the country's electric power.)<br />\nThe government further subsidized nuclear energy by the<br />\n1957 Price-Anderson act which,<br />\nbecause no insurance company<br />\nwould insure a commercial<br />\nreactor, limits a utilities' liability<br />\nin the event of a major accident<br />\nto 500 million dollars. Nuclear<br />\nenergy has never, until now,<br />\nbeen a political issue.

(The result of the '73<br />\nArab oil boycott was surprisingly a decline in the growth rate of<br />\nelectricity demand.) Finally,<br />\nwithout the breeder reactor<br />\nprogram which has been a<br />\ndevastating failure, the nuclear<br />\n<br />\nindustry cannot survive. The<br />\nbreeder reactor recycles spent<br />\nuranium into reusable fuel; unfortunately a by-product is highly toxic plutonium which is<br />\ninto<br />\ntransformable<br />\nreadily<br />\nbombs.<br />\nUtilities are attracted to<br />\nnuclear energy because it is most<br />\nprofitable.

Wolfe obtained<br />\na contract and a menu from the<br />\nhotel and was told that the hotel<br />\nwould reserve the room for him.<br />\nHowever, a week later, the<br />\nHopkins Sheraton called and<br />\ntold him that there had been a<br />\nchange in administration and<br />\nthat the room had been booked<br />\nfor a convention.<br />\nThe hotel told Wolfe that he<br />\ncould still have the room but<br />\naccording to Wolfe, it did so<br />\n\"hoping that I didn't want it.\"<br />\nHowever, the hotel insisted on<br />\nan immediate answer.<br />\nWolfe, who had never returned the contract, on which<br />\nthere was no official time<br />\nlimit, chose not to take the<br />\nroom. However, he based his<br />\ndecision primarily on financial<br />\nreasons rather than on the<br />\nSheraton's error. The dance<br />\nwould have cost $3900 for 200<br />\npersons. Collecting only 25<br />\ndollars per couple,- Wolfe and<br />\nConnolly both felt the loss<br />\nwould have cut too deeply into<br />\nthe Junior class budget.<br />\nAnother reason for the<br />\ncancellation was the temporary<br />\nchange in the final examination<br />\nschedule. Finals were moved up<br />\none week to begin May 7. Wolfe<br />\nfeared there would be a low<br />\nturnout at the dance because it<br />\nwas scheduled for May 4, only<br />\nthree days before the first day of<br />\nfinals.<br />\nWhile the final examination<br />\nschedule has been returned to<br />\nthe original time, Wolfe said it is<br />\nnow too late to reschedule the<br />\ndance.<br />\nHowever, much controversy<br />\n<br />\nhas arisen concerning the Hopkins Sheraton, for this is not the<br />\nfirst time there has been a mixup<br />\ninvolving a Hopkins dance.<br />\nAccording to Senior class President Monroe Zeffert, the same<br />\nthing happened to him when he<br />\ntried to schedule a dance there<br />\nlast year.<br />\nAfter considering several<br />\nlocations, including the Hilton,<br />\nCross Keys and Belvedere, Zeffert chose the Hopkins Sheraton<br />\nfor his class dance to be held last<br />\nApril. Feeling that it was by far<br />\nthe best deal, he reserved a hall<br />\nthere. Zeffert was given a hold<br />\n<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nmeeting, the Student 'Council<br />\ndecided that in order to qualify<br />\nto be put on the ballot in a<br />\nrun-off election, a write-in<br />\ncandidate would have to get 50%<br />\nof the vote or be one of the two<br />\nhighest-scoring candidates in the<br />\nprimary election. Under the old<br />\nrule, there were two methods by<br />\nwhich write-in candidates were<br />\nplaced on the ballot in the<br />\nScott Wolfe<br />\nrun-off election. The highestand told that if anyone else scoring write-in candidate in an<br />\ncalled, he had forty-eight hours unopposed race was automatito sign the contract or give up cally placed on the run-off<br />\nballot, no matter how few<br />\nthe room.<br />\n<br />\nConduct Code Approved By SC,<br />\nTo Be Presented Soon To Deans<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\ngood will of a particular administrator.\"<br />\nThe University currently has<br />\nno Conduct Code because the<br />\nlast one submitted was never<br />\nratified by the Board of Trustees.<br />\nThe Code will deal only<br />\nwith non-academic offenses.<br />\nAcademic offenses will continue<br />\nto be handled by the Ethics<br />\nBoard. Under the system which<br />\nthe Conduct Code would set up,<br />\na charge will be certified by the<br />\nAssociate Dean of the Homewood Faculties. The student will<br />\nbe able to choose whether the<br />\nDean or a student hearing panel<br />\nwill consider his case. The<br />\nhearing panel will consist of five<br />\nmembers of a 10-student member Judicial Board to be<br />\nselected by the Student Council.<br />\nIf a student chooses to have<br />\nhis case presented before the<br />\nJudicial Board, he may also<br />\nchoose whether the case should<br />\nbe made public or remain<br />\nprivate.<br />\nIn order for the. iJudicial<br />\nBoard's hearing panel to convict<br />\na student, four of its five members must find him guilty. If the<br />\npanel convicts a student, it<br />\nmakes a recommendation of<br />\npunishment to the Dean of the<br />\nHomewood Faculties, which he<br />\n<br />\nneed not necessarily follow.<br />\nThe Code also includes<br />\nprovisions for rehearings. Each<br />\nstudent has the right to have his<br />\ncase redetermined within 15<br />\ndays of his notification of the<br />\nresults if new evidence is found.<br />\nlie can also appeal the final<br />\ndetermination and the penalty.<br />\nAll appeals are addressed to the<br />\nProvost, and in cases where<br />\nsuspension or expulsion has been<br />\nmandated, the student can also<br />\nappeal to the President after he<br />\nappeals to the Provost.<br />\nThe main problem still to be<br />\nironed out is the role of the<br />\ndeans. The Student Council<br />\nwould prefer that the dean who<br />\ncertifies the charge against the<br />\nstudent is not the same dean<br />\nwho determines the penalty if<br />\nthe student is convicted. Presently, this would mean that Hall<br />\nwould certify the charge and<br />\nOwen would determine the<br />\npenalty. However, according to<br />\nSimon, the administration has<br />\nindicated that it would prefer to<br />\nhave Hall handle all disciplinary<br />\nmatters by himself.<br />\nThe Student Council has'<br />\nbeen working on the Code for<br />\nmore than a year, beginning<br />\nlast January. Since that time,<br />\none of the main problems has<br />\nbeen defining the University's<br />\njurisdiction of non-academic offenses. The most recent draft of<br />\n<br />\nthe Code outlines this broadly as.<br />\noffenses which constitute \"direct or material damage and/or<br />\nthreats to the health, safety or<br />\nproperty of the University<br />\ncommunity or damage to the<br />\nphysical facilities of the University, and occur on University<br />\nproperty or arise from the<br />\nstudent's affiliation with the<br />\n<br />\nMuller Reveals Plan For<br />\nBalanced Budget By 1982<br />\ncont. from p. 1.<br />\nmillion. Combined funding for<br />\nplant operations and the Library<br />\nwill also rise by just under 1 0%<br />\nif the budget, already cleared by<br />\nthe Board's Budget Committee,<br />\nis approved as expected April<br />\n23.<br />\nMuller and Kreuger are<br />\nalready well-advanced in their<br />\nconsideration of the budget for<br />\n1980-81, the second stage in the<br />\nthree-year program. \"We are not<br />\nsure that we can run without a<br />\ndeficit in 1981,\" Dr. Muller said.<br />\n\"If we have a deficit, we hope to<br />\nhave a small one.\"<br />\n\"We expect to run without<br />\na deficit in 1982,\" he continued.<br />\nHowever, he placed four important qualifiers on that prediction.<br />\nIle said the administration is<br />\nnow assuming an inflation rate<br />\nof 9% over the next several years<br />\n<br />\nwrite-in votes he received. In<br />\naddition, if a write-in candidate<br />\nwas one of the top two scorers<br />\nin a contested race, he would be<br />\nlisted on the run-off ballots.<br />\nThis procedure was changed<br />\nafter the Council experienced<br />\nnumerous, difficulties with it in<br />\nthe last Election. As Student<br />\nCouncil Elections Committee<br />\nchairperson Monroe Zeffert said,<br />\n\"It (the old system) was far<br />\nfrom easy.\"<br />\nThe run-off elections to de'cide<br />\nthe final winners will be held<br />\nMonday through Wednesday of<br />\nnext week.<br />\n<br />\nin .its projections. \"If we have a<br />\nlower rate, we'll probably do<br />\nbetter, but if it's higher, we'll<br />\nprobably do worse,\" he commented.<br />\nOther key assumptions are<br />\nthat the base of research grants<br />\nawarded the University will<br />\ncontinue to rise, as it has over<br />\nthe past few years, and that the<br />\nUniversity will avoid a major<br />\nreduction in indirect cost recoveries on these grants due to<br />\nnew accounting methods recently introduced in federal regulations.<br />\nIndirect costs are expenses<br />\nincurred by the University for<br />\nsuch items as buildings, equipment and electricity, which are<br />\nused in research but are not paid<br />\nfor by the grants obtained<br />\nfor individual projects. The new<br />\nguidelines, introduced in a circular referred to by the administra-<br />\n<br />\ntion as A-21, reclassify items<br />\nsuch as training, which is not<br />\nsubject to indirect cost recover,<br />\nand it is feared they may have an<br />\nadverse impact on the rate at<br />\nwhich the University is entitled<br />\nto collect indirect costs, according to Krueger.<br />\nMuller also said that the<br />\nUniversity will have to obtain<br />\n\"substantial new revenues\" from<br />\ndonations and other fund<br />\nsources in order to meet the<br />\nthree-year plan goals.<br />\nOverall, the entire budget<br />\nfor the University will rise from<br />\n$176 million this year to about<br />\n$200 million in 1979-80. However, Muller noted that $5<br />\nmillion of this increase resulted<br />\nfrom a simple bookkeeping<br />\noperation in which some clinical<br />\nservices performed in East<br />\nBaltimore were transferred from<br />\nthe Hospital to the University.<br />\n<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\nSimon explained that earlier<br />\ndrafts of the Code were too<br />\nspecific and too restrictive of the<br />\nUniversity's powers. \"We had so<br />\nmany problems with that, with<br />\ntrying to get 21 people (Student<br />\nCouncil members) to decide<br />\nwhat are or are not offenses<br />\nagainst the University.\"<br />\n<br />\nEMPLOYMENT INTERVIEWS<br />\nThe following is a list of employment interviews held in the<br />\nPlacement Bureau for the month of April.

But<br />\nnow it's almost safe to say that we have definitely<br />\narrived. Don't call these girls a cab We're here to stay.<br />\nThe Olden Days:<br />\nFrom the very beginning, the founders of Hopkins<br />\ndevoted considerable thought to the education of<br />\nwomen--mainly, to how long the University could avoid<br />\nit. An exaggerated concern for the delicate constitutions<br />\nof the feebler sex seems to have been the main excuse<br />\nfor barring it. As first University president Gilman put it<br />\nin 1876, the Trustees hesitated to expose the ladies to<br />\n\"the rougher influences found in colleges and universities where young men resort.\"<br />\nThere were exceptions, few and far between, mostly<br />\nscholars of demonstrated exceptional ability and the<br />\ndaughters and spouses of professors. The first female<br />\nstudent at Hopkins was Martha Carey Thomas. The<br />\nBoard of Trustees said that she could be guided in her<br />\ngraduate studies by University professors and take their<br />\nexams\u2014but she could not attend classes, including an<br />\nimportant Greek Seminary taught by Dr. Gildersleeve. It<br />\nwas rumored that she got to listen to the lectures by<br />\nhiding behind a screen in the classroom.<br />\nThough Thomas passed her first-year examinations<br />\nwith commendations, she withdrew from the University<br />\nthe following year because she felt she was merely a<br />\nprivate pupil of Dr. Gildersleeve, which was unfair to<br />\nhim and was not what she wanted. Thomas went on to<br />\nbecome the first woman Ph.D. at the University of<br />\nZurich and the dean and president of Bryn Mawr. The<br />\nJ.H.U. Women's Center was named after her.<br />\nAlthough graduate and undergraduate women<br />\ncontinued to press for admission, the Board of Trustees<br />\nrefused to establish a standard until 1879, when they<br />\ndecreed that 'ladies may. be admitted to lectures in<br />\nHopkins Hall,'but \"not (to) the usual classes and (to)<br />\nlectures not specially excepted.\" They barred undergraduate women entirely.<br />\nAny inclinations that Hopkins Trustees may have<br />\nfelt toward admitting female undergrads vanished in<br />\n1888 when the Women's College of Baltimore (now<br />\nGoucher) was founded. It was just what the anti-coeducation majority was looking for: \"an adequate answer<br />\nto any call that the University's undergraduate class be<br />\nopened to women students.\"<br />\nIt was in the Medical School that women finally<br />\nbroke the graduate student sex barrier. Trustees had<br />\nbanned women from that particular branch of the<br />\nUniversity -because what went on in the Biology laboratories was deemed \"inappropriate\" for ladies to witness.<br />\nIn 1889 plans for the building of the long-delayed<br />\nSchool of Medicine were stymied by a lack of funds.<br />\nNancy Morris Davies, Mary Garrett and a Women's Fund<br />\nCommittee got together to offer the S406,000 needed to<br />\ncomplete the school--on the condition that women be<br />\nadmitted on the same basis as men. When the school<br />\nopened in 1893, three of the original 18 M.D. candidates<br />\nwere women.<br />\n<br />\n11 '<br />\n\"Frankly, I find you rather immature.\"<br />\n<br />\nAnd in the spring of 1907 other University departments<br />\nfollowed suit as Hopkins became \"the last of the great<br />\ngraduate institutions in the country to admit women.\"<br />\nA few women appeared among the first faculty<br />\nmembers of the Medical School, and a few female<br />\nlecturers appeared from time to time. But not until 1916<br />\ndid the first full-professor-to-be appear in the Division of<br />\nArts and Sciences.<br />\nDr. Florence Eilau Bamberger came to Hopkins<br />\nfrom Columbia, with her Ph.D. in the philosophy of<br />\neducation. By 1924 she had been -appointed a full<br />\nprofessor; later she became director of the College of<br />\nTeachers at the University. Dr. Bamberger worked for<br />\nthe instruction of educators and in child-centered<br />\nteaching. She wrote prolifically and lectured around the<br />\nworld.<br />\nBesides being a scholar, Bamberger was a dedicated<br />\nfeminist. In a 1933 interview the Sun reported that \"Dr.<br />\nBamberger has only scorn for the current fashion of<br />\nsnubbing female intellectuals and mingles pride with<br />\nmild resentment that she is the lone woman professor<br />\n(at) Homewood...\" The writer continued, \"She looks<br />\nforward to the day when the pedantic male will be taken<br />\ndown a peg or so by his ambitious sisters.\"<br />\nBamberger participated in the great march for<br />\nwomen's suffrage in 1914; and when the 19th Amendment was finally added to the Constitution \"she regretted that she had only one vote to cast for Woodrow<br />\nWilson.\"<br />\nUndergraduate coeducation at Hopkins got off to a<br />\npromising start in February 1969. While students demonstrating against the Vietnam War marched outside, the<br />\nHopkins faculty met to seriously consider the question<br />\nof admitting women undergraduates. A News-Letter<br />\nreporter in attendance duly noted, \"Most professors<br />\nwere clearly bored by the issue.\"<br />\nAlthough most faculty members eventually favored<br />\ncoeducation, opinion was divided at first. Some agreed<br />\nwith Dr. Kerr that admitting women would raise the<br />\nenrollment in the Humanities and the social sciences at<br />\nthe expense of the sciences and engineering (it did not).<br />\nDr. Jack Green of the History department \"defended\"<br />\nthe principle of coeducation on the grounds that women<br />\nwould occasion more academic interest because \"boys<br />\n(would have to) work in order to keep above the girls.\"<br />\nWhen the Academic Council officially recommended that undergraduate women be admitted to Hopkins,<br />\nthen-University President Lincoln Gordon appointed a<br />\nTask Force on Coeducation to explore the question and<br />\nto make recommendations. The Committee came out in<br />\nfavor of admitting undergraduate women for several<br />\nreasons: (1) enrolling women would actually increase<br />\nthe size of the pool of qualified applicants (it did);(2)<br />\nincrease the diversity of courses in the Humanities<br />\nespecially (it did not);(3) improve the intellectual and<br />\nsocial environment of the campus. (did it?)<br />\nThere were those Hopkins men who protested the<br />\nproposed onslaught of women. One student complained<br />\nthat \"the Hopkins coed shall displace an otherwise<br />\nwell-qualified man from attending Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity...the femme fatale on campus today, at best,<br />\nonly will be some struggling professional's chief cook<br />\nand bottle washer tomorrow.\"<br />\nAnother objected that \"the aura of ravishing fair<br />\nyoung maidens billowing down the valleys of the quad is<br />\na myth. The woman brought to Hopkins would only<br />\nbe...a female version of the C-Level technocrat grinding<br />\naway...'Romance' and 'Hopkins' seem mutually exclusive (to me)...\"<br />\nBut cooler heads prevailed, and on October 14,<br />\n1969, the Board of Trustees officially approved the<br />\ncoedification of Johns llopkins University, breaking the<br />\n93-year-old undergraduate sex harrier.<br />\nHopkins had never gone coed before and didn't<br />\nknow quite how to go about it. Although female graduate students had been attending the University for the<br />\npast 62 years, Hopkins still lacked such basic necessities<br />\nas adequate housing (no dorms); enough lavatories for<br />\nwomen; gynecological services at the Infirmary; and an<br />\norganization to deal specifically' with the problems coeds<br />\nwould face. The official University answer to all these<br />\nshortcomings was to be \"flexible\" until such time as a<br />\nreal need was demonstrated.<br />\nBecause of housing problems the first undergraduate<br />\nwomen to attend Hopkins were 21 freshmen from the<br />\nBaltimore area, some of whom would commute; while<br />\n<br />\nthe rest, along with 69 transfer students, would be<br />\nlodged in then all-graduate McCoy Hall. According to<br />\nMike Hill, N-L reporter and erstwhile leader of one of<br />\nthe women's segregated orientation groups, Hopkins<br />\nmen \"responded to their presence with the brazen<br />\nbehavior which has marked the appearance of females on<br />\ncampus in previous years.\" He did not elaborate.<br />\nThe first women undergraduates received a peculiar<br />\nsort of attention from their male fellow students which<br />\nwas not always appreciated:<br />\n\"When you walk into a small class, all conversation<br />\nstops and 38 coordinated eyeballs follow you to your<br />\nseat...If you sit down in a big lecture hall, nobody will<br />\nsit next to you until all the other seats are taken--we call<br />\nit the Island Theory...You feel like a cross between<br />\nGypsy Roselee and Typhoid Mary.\"<br />\nOne student commented, \"In the beginning most<br />\nmen went out of their way to be courteous to women<br />\nstudents to the point of abnormality. We received a lot<br />\nof attention.\" For example, she said, a male student<br />\nwould pass through a doorway, suddenly realize that the<br />\ndoor was about to slam in the face of the woman behind<br />\nhim and would rush to stop it before it could.<br />\nOnce they had settled in, Hopkins women did not<br />\nhesitate long before responding to the more blatant signs<br />\nof discrimination around them. On October 6, 1970, the<br />\nNews-Letter ran the first letter written by a female<br />\n<br />\nstudent objecting to its sexist policies. The writer<br />\ncriticized an ad featuring \"a halfclothed 'chick' simpering under the macho gaze of a naked-torsoed stud.\" It<br />\ncontinued, \"By printing such bullshit sexist ads, you are<br />\nperpetuating the oppression and dehumanization of<br />\nwomen.\"<br />\nOne response to sexism and to the needs of undergraduate women was to include women's studies courses<br />\nin the curriculum. In 1971 Emily Toth, a graduate<br />\nstudent in comparative literature, tried to set up a course .<br />\nin \"Literary Perspectives on Women.\" The Humanities<br />\ndepartment approved, provided the course be taught on<br />\na non-credit basis--because they felt that Mrs. Toth, who<br />\nhad supported her family for three years teaching. at<br />\nMorgan State--would \"overburden\" herself by teaching<br />\none credit course while studying at Hopkins. In an<br />\nabrupt change of face, a News-Letter editorial commended Toth for \"undertaking something special for<br />\nand about and by women.\"<br />\nUndergraduate complaints of discrimination moved<br />\ngraduate students to examine their own situation with<br />\n<br />\n\fI be<br />\ng to<br />\nte of<br />\nlkins<br />\nazen<br />\n.s on<br />\nrate.<br />\nuliar<br />\n'hich<br />\n<br />\nition<br />\nyour<br />\nwill<br />\ncall<br />\nYeen<br />\n<br />\nmost<br />\nmen<br />\na lot<br />\ndent<br />\nt the<br />\nrhind<br />\n<br />\nI not<br />\nsigns<br />\nI, the<br />\nmale<br />\n<br />\nrriter<br />\nriper.\" It<br />\nu are<br />\n1 of<br />\n<br />\nrider''<br />\nu rses<br />\njuate<br />\nJU rse<br />\nities<br />\n[it on<br />\nwho<br />\nrig at<br />\n:hing<br />\nall<br />\ncornI for<br />\n<br />\nroved<br />\nwith<br />\n<br />\nrespect to their professors and peers.

Graduate Nr, men demanded more -;ourses,<br />\ne centers; fairer distribution of<br />\nbetter instruction, da.,<br />\nfellowships and more women faculty members as role<br />\nmodels.<br />\nThe first woman coeds graduated from Hopkins in<br />\n1974. Some women,m io felt that as a class their experiences were unique and interesting, organized a commit-tee to write a speech for graduation. They sent out a<br />\nsurvey asking their fe, Ile classmates about their impressions of undergraduate life. Although responses varied,<br />\nthe general consensus seems to be summed up in the<br />\nwords of one of the first transfer students:<br />\n\"One thing which this class of women learned, I<br />\nfeel, is to be stronger. The very fact that all gains for<br />\nwomen had to be fought for actively...has given us a<br />\nbasis for examining some of the more insidious ways<br />\nwomen are treated in the society as a whole...Although<br />\nI still have misgivings...I think Hopkins has developed<br />\ninto a more egalitarian institution than my other school,<br />\nwhere they were not forced to confront their attitudes<br />\nand change them.\"<br />\nNot to be outdone by our feminist predecessors, we<br />\nconducted our own survey of Hopkins women, undergraduates and graduates alike. The five questions we<br />\nasked drew a variety of often quite startling responses:<br />\n1. Why did you come to Hopkins? Did the male/female ratio affect your decision?<br />\nThe reasons most women gave for coming to<br />\nHopkins were those that might attract any male applicant: reputation of the school or of the department,<br />\ngenerous financial aid, small class size, etc. Most said<br />\nthat although the male/female ratio did not affect<br />\ntheir actual decision to apply, it didn't bother them too<br />\nmuch either. There were a few exceptions:<br />\n\"I'm here first socially--then academically.\"<br />\n\"I thought it would give me the right to be choosy<br />\nand the center of attraction.\"<br />\n<br />\n2. How do you think Hopkins women are viewed<br />\nby their male peers? By male professors?<br />\nResponses on this question varied widely, and might<br />\nbest be expressed by a sampling of quotes:<br />\n\"Men don't notice women, basically because we<br />\ndon't make enough noise. People don't even know we're<br />\ncoed yet.\"<br />\n\"Professors are easily duped. They will bend over<br />\nbackwards for us. It's an advantage I like and exploit.\"<br />\n\"Women have an advantage in the Humanities<br />\nbecause they are taught to be more humane.\"<br />\n\"Hopkins men have a respect for Hopkins women<br />\nintellectually but'not socially, which I find strange...It<br />\nmay be that they are scared of the intelligence and<br />\nsophistication of Hopkins women.\"<br />\n\"Women are viewed by the majority as wanting to<br />\nlatch onto a guy.. they aren't supposed to be really<br />\nserious about their work. The men set up the stereotype<br />\nand the women fulfill it.\"<br />\n3. How do Hopkins women feel about Hopkins<br />\nWomen?<br />\n<br />\nMost freshman women seemed to view other women<br />\nas social and academic competition. A minority expressed a desire for more female companionship. Among the<br />\nupper classes and graduate students the trend was<br />\nentirely opposite--women would seem to \"look to each<br />\nother for support,\" to form close community or family-type relationships. Yet perhaps because of the male/female ratio, many women said that they had more close<br />\nfriendships with men than women.<br />\n\"I feel that we (female graduate students) can cope<br />\nwith the pressures of Hopkins better than the male<br />\ngraduate student. Because we're doing something non-traditional, we know pretty much when we arrive what<br />\nkind of shit we'll have to face.\"<br />\n\"Hopkins women don't know Hopkins women. We<br />\nare too isolated from one another. I think all women<br />\nwould like to see more women here.\"<br />\n4. How do you feel about being a woman student<br />\nat Hopkins?<br />\nUndergraduate women pereived that .their sex made<br />\na difference socially but not academically. Graduate<br />\nwomen expressed a definite awareness that their gender<br />\naffected their academic existence at Hopkins.<br />\n\"There's a lot more happening here for girls than<br />\nguys. A small number of girls makes participation in<br />\nactivities like the Glee Club and the Drama department<br />\ndependent on interest and not ability.\"<br />\n\"When you finally do accomplish something in<br />\ncompetition with men there is a greater sense of victory.<br />\nNot a personal victory, but a social victory.\"<br />\nWomen offered suggestions including more Affirmative Action hiring, particularly to provide faculty role<br />\nmodels for women.<br />\n\"There are no real women get-togethers here. And<br />\nthere should be. But they should avoid the stigma of<br />\nwomen's lib. Maybe we could get together to learn<br />\nself-sufficiency. It would be nice if guys were there too<br />\nbecause we would be in a non-competitive and non-social atmosphere.\"<br />\nWe wanted to interview another segment of the<br />\nfemale population--women faculty and administration--to find out about their accomplishments and their<br />\nviews regarding Hopkins women in general.<br />\nDr. Ghilaine Godenne is director of Counseling and<br />\nPsychiatric Services for the University. She has been part<br />\nof Hopkins for 22 years, has worked in the White House<br />\nfor the last six, and was the first woman staff resident in<br />\nthe School of Medicine.<br />\nGodenne said that as far as undergraduates are<br />\nconcerned, women are much better off now than when<br />\ncoeducation began.\"Women are much more competitive<br />\nnow than before. Then they were continuously looked<br />\nat to see how they would do...but there is still discrimination. Women have to achieve more than men in order to<br />\nget the same benefits.\"<br />\nShe felt the male/female ratio is \"much worse on<br />\nthe males...The academic competition makes dating an<br />\ninfrequent pleasure.\"<br />\nGodenne said that the greatest problem for Hopkins<br />\nwomen is the conflict between the traditional wife-mother role and that of a professional working woman.<br />\n\"Most women don't realize they can have both even if<br />\nthis involves some sacrifices.\"<br />\nGodenne cited the ridiculously low number of<br />\nwomen faculty members as a prime example of current<br />\ndiscrimination. Although Hopkins compares favorably<br />\nwith other Ivy League schools in terms of per cent of<br />\nwomen faculty, the vast majority of these women hold<br />\nlower-echelon positions.<br />\n\"Kindness of heart, keenness of mind have made<br />\nCarrie May Kurrelmeyer Zintl a devoted alumnus and a<br />\nbeloved world citizen.\" In 1978, the JHU Alumni<br />\nAssociation made this award to Dr. Carrie Zintl, guest<br />\nlecturer and a senior member of the faculty.<br />\nDr. Zintl took her Ph.D. in German and Classics at<br />\nHopkins at 24. Though she was one of only a few<br />\nwomen students, Dr. Zintl feels that she was always<br />\ntreated with respect. She believes in hard work as a<br />\nremedy for discrimination: \"If you do your work,<br />\nI've found there are no distinctions made. If you can<br />\n<br />\ndeliver the goods you come out all right.\"<br />\nDr. Phoebe Stanton, professor and chairperson of<br />\nthe History of Art Department, discussed her work and<br />\nher relations with the students. She came to Hopkins in<br />\n'62 having earned her doctorate at the University of<br />\nLondon under renowned architect Nikolaus Pevsner. She<br />\nhas published two books and numerous journal articles<br />\nand lectures nationwide.<br />\nOf special interest to Dr. Stanton is the practical<br />\napplication of her researches. She serves on various<br />\nurban planning boards where her knowledge of architecture comes into play. And she teaches. \"I love the<br />\nstudents. They're why you're here. They remember the<br />\ncourses, the works of art...that makes it all worthwhile.\"<br />\nToday women undergraduates are working both on<br />\ntheir own and through campus organizations to achieve<br />\ntheir goals. While some groups in which women participate continue to be strongly supported, others have<br />\ndeclined since the early '70's. The Women's Athletic<br />\nProgram is one of the success stories. Hopkins now hosts<br />\nnot one but seven varsity teams--in field hockey, tennis,<br />\nfencing, squash, swimming, basketball and lacrosse.<br />\nWomen athletes express varying views about the<br />\nstate of women's sports at Hopkins. While most feel that<br />\nfaculties and budgeting are now proportionately equal to<br />\nthose allotted to men, a few complain about inconvenient practice times, frequent turnover of coaches and<br />\ndifficulties in getting new sports started.<br />\nSome women stressed that because the program is<br />\nnot very developed, there is no necessity for stardom.<br />\n\"Sports here function on the principle of interest, not<br />\nthe principle of ability,\" one student said.<br />\nThe Women's Center, however, has not progressed<br />\nas far. It is no longer the radical organization created by<br />\nthe first women undergraduates. The Center is less active<br />\nin undergraduate concerns, perhaps because the undergraduates demonstrate a little interest in the Center.<br />\nA spokesperson for the Center attributes undergraduate apathy to the fact that they are not as strongly affected by role conflicts which society commonly<br />\nimposes on women. She felt Hopkins undergrads are<br />\n\"very concerned academically but apolitical and apathetic.\"<br />\n\"Undergraduate women tend to believe that sexism<br />\nhas been conquered and do not see that discrimination<br />\ntoday is not blatant, but subtle,\"she concluded.<br />\nThe first undergraduate women knew just how<br />\nmuch they had achieved, but they felt a need to affirm<br />\ntheir position and suggest a future orientation. In 1974,<br />\nthe founders of the Women's Center planned a series of<br />\nspeakers and events for women. Entitled Next Step: A<br />\nFestival of Women, it was aimed at celebrating the<br />\npresent and potential role of women in today's world.<br />\nThe program coicided with the graduation of the first<br />\nfour-year coed class.<br />\nThe featured speakers included poet Anne Sexton<br />\nand Jane Fonda. Sissy Farenthold, a Texas state legislator and the National Women's Caucus Chairperson,<br />\nspoke on the problems of women in America, addressing<br />\nher talk to Hopkins women:<br />\n\"I think that for women at Hopkins, especially the<br />\nmembers of the first four-year coeducational class, there<br />\ncomes first a need for awareness, for without awareness<br />\nyou can't know what you are about. Then there's a place<br />\nfor assertiveness, and a time for audacity.\"<br />\n<br />\nRepresentatives of the women in the first coeducational class were invited to speak on their experiences at<br />\ntheir Commencement ceremonies. They chose to focus<br />\nthe close of their speech on what, after all, seemed the<br />\nmost important aspect of their undergraduate experience:<br />\n\"We, in this graduating class, were the instruments<br />\nof change. Our unique experiences, however, have not<br />\nprevented us from maintaining our high ambitions. We<br />\nplan to make our education productive, to utilize it<br />\nbeyond this level. Eighty per cent of the women graduating today are going on in higher education and then<br />\nprofessional careers. We will be the doctors, scientists,<br />\nlawyers, politicians and professors of tomorrow. We as<br />\nwomen hope to continue to work towards abolishing<br />\nsocial stereotypes for ourselves and others, as this<br />\nsociety begins to acknowledge the capabilities of all its<br />\nmembers.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 10 I APRIL 13, 1979<br />\n<br />\nWizardry<br />\nThe following is an excerpt from the fourteenth<br />\nbicentennial report of the agent Saurak to the monitoring committee of the planet Euremia.<br />\n...I have had occasion to observe a mew form of<br />\nworship which has recently arisen on this planet, already<br />\nso replete with a variety of peculiar mystic practices.<br />\nThe chapel of this religion at the University currently<br />\nunder my surveillance is located down the hall and<br />\naround the corner from the Office of the Chaplain,<br />\nwhich apparently is the official organ assigned to exercise a general supervision over all such spiritual activities.<br />\nWhile the new practice does share some of the characteristics of the antique religions, it takes a unique flavor<br />\nfrom the use of the recently-improved if still primitive<br />\ntechnology on the planet.<br />\nThe chief rite consists of the worship of a silver ball,<br />\nafter which the sect takes its name,\"pinball.\" There are<br />\nabout .10 such balls in the whole chapel at Johns Hopkins, each encased in its own glass and wood housing.<br />\nThey remain out of sight, cloistered in these boxes until<br />\nsomeone comes in to make a donation and pray.<br />\nThe practice of this pinball is standardi7ed to a high<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nBrilliantly-lit beauties adorn<br />\nmany of these machines.<br />\ndegree. The ball appeal s, in the presence ut tlic<br />\nshipper for a period of about a minute at a time. During<br />\nthis session, the cult follower enters a trance-like state of<br />\nintense concentration, and dares not remove his eyes<br />\nfrom the silver orb as it rolls along inside the box.<br />\nFrequently he will also shake his body, nudge the ball's<br />\nhousing, and manipulate a pair of electric levers as he<br />\nattempts to retain the ball within his view. Fortunately<br />\nfor the worshipper, however, these efforts invariably<br />\nprove futile because the machines containing the balls<br />\nare designed not to allow them to remain exposed for<br />\nexcessive periods of time. Evidently brevity of the<br />\nprayer session is a critical aspect of pinball practice,<br />\nsince the technicians assigned to care for the balls<br />\nand their machines always adjust, disconnect, or remove<br />\nthem immediately should it become possible for the<br />\nworshipper to view the ball for a protracted period of<br />\ntime. My conjecture is that the reasons behind this are<br />\ntwofold. Physiological effects such as rapid heart rate<br />\n<br />\nand sudden secretions of the sweat glands of the palms<br />\nand armpits observed in the worshippers while the balls<br />\nare in view indicate that the mystic trance is characterized by a high stress level which might prove detrimental to the follower's health if sustained over long<br />\ntime periods. The short prayer time also facilitates access<br />\nto the sacred balls by a large number of people and<br />\nreduces the time necessary for them to wait before<br />\nperforming their devotions.<br />\nWhile the ball is'in view (it is protected by the glass<br />\ncasing of the housing so that no one can ever be so<br />\nprofane as to touch it), its machine emits noises and<br />\nflashes lights evidently calculated to have some significance for the initiated devotee. The tones produced vary<br />\nfrom one machine to another. Some make rapid bursts<br />\nat high frequencies which resemble the sounds made by<br />\nthe archaic gunpowder-operated automatic weapons<br />\nused in warfare on this planet, but most simply utter<br />\nbell-like noises similar to those which can sometimes<br />\nbe heard on the devices they use to receive video transmissions emanating frem the western coast of the United<br />\nStates. That these sounds have some symbolic importance for the practice of pinball is confirmed by the<br />\nfact that followers who have spent the largest amounts<br />\nof time in prayer are also the ones who hear the most<br />\nnoises while they are worshipping. It is also interesting<br />\nto note that these most faithful adherents are permitted<br />\nto view the sacred ball longer than newcomers. This of<br />\ncourse is due to the physical conditioning built up in<br />\nthese individuals over a large number of prayer sessions,<br />\nwhich permits them to better withstand the rigors of the<br />\npinball services. It also serves as a clever and effective<br />\nmeans of rewarding longtime members of the sect, who<br />\ntake an extreme pride in their exalted status within the<br />\npinball congregation.<br />\nNow, as I mentioned a moment ago, the sacred ball<br />\ninvariably returns to its resting place inside the wooden<br />\nhousing. But that event does not immediately mark the<br />\nend of the prayer session. It appears obligatory for the<br />\nworshipper to make some gesture of thanks to the<br />\nmachine for having provided him with a few moments of<br />\nenrapfured ball-viewing. This portion of the rite allows<br />\nmembers more freedom in their manner of praise, which<br />\ncan take the form of any of a large number of sometimes<br />\nbizarre rituals. One very common method followed by<br />\nmany worshippers is to curse and blaspheme against the<br />\ngods of the planet's other religions, which is a way of<br />\nexpressing thanks for having rejected them for the richer<br />\nmode of experience offered by pinball. Other means Of<br />\nperforming the closing rite can be more physical. Some<br />\nshove the machine in a magnified version of the nudges<br />\nperformed while the ball is in view, while others follow a<br />\ncustom which to me makes little sense but is nevertheless for some reason among the most popular--they<br />\npound ferociously on the glass cover which protects the<br />\nsacred ball.<br />\nAs you will recall, the inhabitants of the planet in<br />\nthe vicinity of the Euphrates River several thousand<br />\nEarth-orbits ago used to employ in their religion, sexual<br />\nrelations with their priestess as part of their sacred<br />\nreligious rites. While such libidinous activity has been<br />\nintensively suppressed by the religious institutions<br />\nhereabouts for the past two millenia, pinball reprewnts a<br />\nreturn to an emphasis on sex in worship. In fact, sex is<br />\none of the primary elements of symbolism in the new<br />\nreligion. Brilliantly-lit drawings of handsome males and<br />\nalluring female figures adorn the majority of the ballholding machines. And when a worshipper has the ball<br />\n<br />\ndisappear from view after an ecstatic if brief prayer<br />\nsession, he can often be heard tc claim. Thie machine<br />\nscrewed me.\"<br />\nPerhaps the most inaiguinp and sinister aspect of<br />\nthis pinball religion is the quec psychological _hold it<br />\nday can pass when a<br />\nachieves over its member. Rarel<br />\nfollower fails to e\u2014ploy as many quarters 'is he happens<br />\nto have in his pockets for donat,,,ns to the sacred balls,<br />\nwhile other religions on the planet consider themselves<br />\nfortunate if their adherents wors1;p weekly. As a result,<br />\nthe sect's leaders (custodians of the balls and their<br />\nmachines) have become quite wealthy. At the Hopkins<br />\ncenter alone, they pocketed upward of $15,000 (3000<br />\nEuremic centares) last year, while a clique of students at<br />\nthe University took an equal share simply for granting<br />\nthe religion the privilege of operating at the school.<br />\nPinball followers at the temple I have been observing are<br />\nmostly male students at the University, although occasionally children and females are also permitted to be<br />\ninitiated and allowed to take part in the sacred rites.<br />\nI have not, as yet, been able to determine whether<br />\nthe pinball religion will eventually gain ascendancy on<br />\nthe planet.

When<br />\nher lover offers his handkerchief, to her<br />\nhusband, he receives the same emotional<br />\n<br />\ngratification-the same noble feeling--he<br />\nwould have had if Solange had wanted<br />\nhim to comfort her.

Two things, however, need to be not<br />\nspecific departmental but general prerequisites for any<br />\nundergraduate who obtains a diploma here.<br />\n'One major activity young people engage in while<br />\nobtaining a University education is organizing their<br />\nthoughts along novel conceptual frameworks. These<br />\nframeworks, like Marxism for example, can be quite<br />\nprofound in scope, and frequently they contrast with or<br />\ncontradict the frameworks people have been accustomed<br />\nto in a way which provides a very valuable perspective.<br />\nThinking according to such a new perspective allows us to<br />\nsee how the assumptions we have .grown up with have<br />\nshaped to a surprising extent the way we perceive events<br />\nand conditions in the external world.<br />\nThe framework which affects both the broadest<br />\nportion of our lives and at the same time incorporates the<br />\nmost specific conceptual units necessary for thought is our<br />\nlanguage. No idea can take shape even in our minds, much<br />\nless in our speech. without words. So it follows that for an<br />\neducated person it is most essential to be able to stand<br />\naside for a moment and take a look at the linguistic<br />\nframework that has molded him. The best available means<br />\nfor doing so is to learn and employ a second language.<br />\nSuccessful completion of at least an elementary-level<br />\ncourse in some language should therefore be made a<br />\ncompulsory requirement for undergraduates at Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThere is another reason why a general foreign language<br />\nrequirement should be instituted. All too many Americans.<br />\nincluding even the majority of college graduates, remain<br />\nignorant of the rich cultural heritage to which we are heir,<br />\na heritage largely shaped on the continent of Europe<br />\nand the sands of the Near East. They are too often unaware and seemingly uninterested in the dramatic events<br />\nwhich unfold even today outside the borders of the U.S. A<br />\ngraduate of a first-rate American institution of higher<br />\nlearning should be capable of rising above this general tide<br />\nof ignorance. A Hopkins graduate should at least possess<br />\nsome level of competency in a foreign language. Such<br />\ncompetency is an absolute minimum tool necessary ,for a<br />\nperson to achieve a sufficient level of culture and cosmopolitanism to be described by the term \"educated.\"<br />\nAt the same time, another language requirement of a<br />\nvery different nature should be instituted. All students<br />\nshould be required to demonstrate some minimum level of<br />\nproficiency in a computer language.<br />\nComputers are constanth becoming more important in<br />\nour society. Almost no field of endeavor is immune to the<br />\nimprovements which can be effected through their use. So<br />\nthe ability to work with computers is valuable no matter<br />\nwhat career a person may ultimately follow, and just like<br />\nknowing a foreign language it is important for an educated<br />\nadult in the 1980's to possess.<br />\nLike foreign languages, computer languages are an<br />\nalternative to the conceptual framework employed in the<br />\nEnglish language. They are much easier to learn than<br />\nforeign languages, and while they are structured similarly<br />\nto English (so are the Romance and Teutonic languages,<br />\nfor that matter), they are different enough to make<br />\nlearning one a worthwhile intellectual exercise in itself.<br />\nEngineering, mathematics, and science-oriented students<br />\nwill undoubtedly gripe if a foreign language requirement is<br />\ninstituted, and many humanistic area majors will be even<br />\nmore upset about the prospect of having to take a computer course. But the curriculum reviewers should plot<br />\na course designed to truly _educate Hopkins undergraduates. even against their present-day wills.<br /><br />\nNuke Non-Necessity<br />\nBY JOHN GUNN<br /><br />\nThe editorial \"Nuke Necessity\" expresses quite succinctly<br />\nsome common misconceptions<br />\nand antiquated notions apparently held by too many Americans. Underlying the editorial<br />\nwas the assumption that the U.S.<br />\neconomy must continue to<br />\ngrow, consuming more and more<br />\nenergy in the process, in order to<br />\nsurvive.

Without huge<br />\nfederal expenditures in nuclear<br />\nenergy research and development in the '50s and '60s, a time<br />\nwhen the U.S. energy outlook<br />\nwas fairly stable, there would be<br />\nno commercial nuclear energy<br />\nin the U.S. today.<br />\n(In 1953 the Atomic Energy<br />\nCommission, which at that time<br />\nwas solely in the business<br />\nof weapons production,employed 5% of the U.S. construction<br />\nlabor force and consumed 10%<br />\nof the country's electric power.)<br />\nThe government further subsidized nuclear energy by the<br />\n1957 Price-Anderson act which,<br />\nbecause no insurance company<br />\nwould insure a commercial<br />\nreactor, limits a utilities' liability<br />\nin the event of a major accident<br />\nto 500 million dollars. Nuclear<br />\nenergy has never, until now,<br />\nbeen a political issue.

(The result of the '73<br />\nArab oil boycott was surprisingly a decline in the growth rate of<br />\nelectricity demand.) Finally,<br />\nwithout the breeder reactor<br />\nprogram which has been a<br />\ndevastating failure, the nuclear<br /><br />\nindustry cannot survive.

Wolfe obtained<br />\na contract and a menu from the<br />\nhotel and was told that the hotel<br />\nwould reserve the room for him.<br />\nHowever, a week later, the<br />\nHopkins Sheraton called and<br />\ntold him that there had been a<br />\nchange in administration and<br />\nthat the room had been booked<br />\nfor a convention.<br />\nThe hotel told Wolfe that he<br />\ncould still have the room but<br />\naccording to Wolfe, it did so<br />\n\"hoping that I didn't want it.\"<br />\nHowever, the hotel insisted on<br />\nan immediate answer.<br />\nWolfe, who had never returned the contract, on which<br />\nthere was no official time<br />\nlimit, chose not to take the<br />\nroom. However, he based his<br />\ndecision primarily on financial<br />\nreasons rather than on the<br />\nSheraton's error. The dance<br />\nwould have cost $3900 for 200<br />\npersons. Collecting only 25<br />\ndollars per couple,- Wolfe and<br />\nConnolly both felt the loss<br />\nwould have cut too deeply into<br />\nthe Junior class budget.<br />\nAnother reason for the<br />\ncancellation was the temporary<br />\nchange in the final examination<br />\nschedule. Finals were moved up<br />\none week to begin May 7. Wolfe<br />\nfeared there would be a low<br />\nturnout at the dance because it<br />\nwas scheduled for May 4, only<br />\nthree days before the first day of<br />\nfinals.<br />\nWhile the final examination<br />\nschedule has been returned to<br />\nthe original time, Wolfe said it is<br />\nnow too late to reschedule the<br />\ndance.<br />\nHowever, much controversy<br /><br />\nhas arisen concerning the Hopkins Sheraton, for this is not the<br />\nfirst time there has been a mixup<br />\ninvolving a Hopkins dance.<br />\nAccording to Senior class President Monroe Zeffert, the same<br />\nthing happened to him when he<br />\ntried to schedule a dance there<br />\nlast year.<br />\nAfter considering several<br />\nlocations, including the Hilton,<br />\nCross Keys and Belvedere, Zeffert chose the Hopkins Sheraton<br />\nfor his class dance to be held last<br />\nApril. Feeling that it was by far<br />\nthe best deal, he reserved a hall<br />\nthere.

Under the old<br />\nrule, there were two methods by<br />\nwhich write-in candidates were<br />\nplaced on the ballot in the<br />\nScott Wolfe<br />\nrun-off election.

Under the system which<br />\nthe Conduct Code would set up,<br />\na charge will be certified by the<br />\nAssociate Dean of the Homewood Faculties. The student will<br />\nbe able to choose whether the<br />\nDean or a student hearing panel<br />\nwill consider his case. The<br />\nhearing panel will consist of five<br />\nmembers of a 10-student member Judicial Board to be<br />\nselected by the Student Council.<br />\nIf a student chooses to have<br />\nhis case presented before the<br />\nJudicial Board, he may also<br />\nchoose whether the case should<br />\nbe made public or remain<br />\nprivate.<br />\nIn order for the. iJudicial<br />\nBoard's hearing panel to convict<br />\na student, four of its five members must find him guilty. If the<br />\npanel convicts a student, it<br />\nmakes a recommendation of<br />\npunishment to the Dean of the<br />\nHomewood Faculties, which he<br /><br />\nneed not necessarily follow.<br />\nThe Code also includes<br />\nprovisions for rehearings. Each<br />\nstudent has the right to have his<br />\ncase redetermined within 15<br />\ndays of his notification of the<br />\nresults if new evidence is found.<br />\nlie can also appeal the final<br />\ndetermination and the penalty.<br />\nAll appeals are addressed to the<br />\nProvost, and in cases where<br />\nsuspension or expulsion has been<br />\nmandated, the student can also<br />\nappeal to the President after he<br />\nappeals to the Provost.<br />\nThe main problem still to be<br />\nironed out is the role of the<br />\ndeans. The Student Council<br />\nwould prefer that the dean who<br />\ncertifies the charge against the<br />\nstudent is not the same dean<br />\nwho determines the penalty if<br />\nthe student is convicted. Presently, this would mean that Hall<br />\nwould certify the charge and<br />\nOwen would determine the<br />\npenalty. However, according to<br />\nSimon, the administration has<br />\nindicated that it would prefer to<br />\nhave Hall handle all disciplinary<br />\nmatters by himself.<br />\nThe Student Council has'<br />\nbeen working on the Code for<br />\nmore than a year, beginning<br />\nlast January. Since that time,<br />\none of the main problems has<br />\nbeen defining the University's<br />\njurisdiction of non-academic offenses. The most recent draft of<br /><br />\nthe Code outlines this broadly as.<br />\noffenses which constitute \"direct or material damage and/or<br />\nthreats to the health, safety or<br />\nproperty of the University<br />\ncommunity or damage to the<br />\nphysical facilities of the University, and occur on University<br />\nproperty or arise from the<br />\nstudent's affiliation with the<br /><br />\nMuller Reveals Plan For<br />\nBalanced Budget By 1982<br />\ncont. from p. 1.<br />\nmillion.

The new<br />\nguidelines, introduced in a circular referred to by the administra-<br /><br />\ntion as A-21, reclassify items<br />\nsuch as training, which is not<br />\nsubject to indirect cost recover,<br />\nand it is feared they may have an<br />\nadverse impact on the rate at<br />\nwhich the University is entitled<br />\nto collect indirect costs, according to Krueger.<br />\nMuller also said that the<br />\nUniversity will have to obtain<br />\n\"substantial new revenues\" from<br />\ndonations and other fund<br />\nsources in order to meet the<br />\nthree-year plan goals.<br />\nOverall, the entire budget<br />\nfor the University will rise from<br />\n$176 million this year to about<br />\n$200 million in 1979-80. However, Muller noted that $5<br />\nmillion of this increase resulted<br />\nfrom a simple bookkeeping<br />\noperation in which some clinical<br />\nservices performed in East<br />\nBaltimore were transferred from<br />\nthe Hospital to the University.<br /><br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\nSimon explained that earlier<br />\ndrafts of the Code were too<br />\nspecific and too restrictive of the<br />\nUniversity's powers. \"We had so<br />\nmany problems with that, with<br />\ntrying to get 21 people (Student<br />\nCouncil members) to decide<br />\nwhat are or are not offenses<br />\nagainst the University.\"<br /><br />\nEMPLOYMENT INTERVIEWS<br />\nThe following is a list of employment interviews held in the<br />\nPlacement Bureau for the month of April.

But<br />\nnow it's almost safe to say that we have definitely<br />\narrived. Don't call these girls a cab We're here to stay.<br />\nThe Olden Days:<br />\nFrom the very beginning, the founders of Hopkins<br />\ndevoted considerable thought to the education of<br />\nwomen--mainly, to how long the University could avoid<br />\nit. An exaggerated concern for the delicate constitutions<br />\nof the feebler sex seems to have been the main excuse<br />\nfor barring it. As first University president Gilman put it<br />\nin 1876, the Trustees hesitated to expose the ladies to<br />\n\"the rougher influences found in colleges and universities where young men resort.\"<br />\nThere were exceptions, few and far between, mostly<br />\nscholars of demonstrated exceptional ability and the<br />\ndaughters and spouses of professors. The first female<br />\nstudent at Hopkins was Martha Carey Thomas. The<br />\nBoard of Trustees said that she could be guided in her<br />\ngraduate studies by University professors and take their<br />\nexams\u2014but she could not attend classes, including an<br />\nimportant Greek Seminary taught by Dr. Gildersleeve. It<br />\nwas rumored that she got to listen to the lectures by<br />\nhiding behind a screen in the classroom.<br />\nThough Thomas passed her first-year examinations<br />\nwith commendations, she withdrew from the University<br />\nthe following year because she felt she was merely a<br />\nprivate pupil of Dr. Gildersleeve, which was unfair to<br />\nhim and was not what she wanted. Thomas went on to<br />\nbecome the first woman Ph.D. at the University of<br />\nZurich and the dean and president of Bryn Mawr. The<br />\nJ.H.U. Women's Center was named after her.<br />\nAlthough graduate and undergraduate women<br />\ncontinued to press for admission, the Board of Trustees<br />\nrefused to establish a standard until 1879, when they<br />\ndecreed that 'ladies may. be admitted to lectures in<br />\nHopkins Hall,'but \"not (to) the usual classes and (to)<br />\nlectures not specially excepted.\" They barred undergraduate women entirely.<br />\nAny inclinations that Hopkins Trustees may have<br />\nfelt toward admitting female undergrads vanished in<br />\n1888 when the Women's College of Baltimore (now<br />\nGoucher) was founded. It was just what the anti-coeducation majority was looking for: \"an adequate answer<br />\nto any call that the University's undergraduate class be<br />\nopened to women students.\"<br />\nIt was in the Medical School that women finally<br />\nbroke the graduate student sex barrier. Trustees had<br />\nbanned women from that particular branch of the<br />\nUniversity -because what went on in the Biology laboratories was deemed \"inappropriate\" for ladies to witness.<br />\nIn 1889 plans for the building of the long-delayed<br />\nSchool of Medicine were stymied by a lack of funds.<br />\nNancy Morris Davies, Mary Garrett and a Women's Fund<br />\nCommittee got together to offer the S406,000 needed to<br />\ncomplete the school--on the condition that women be<br />\nadmitted on the same basis as men. When the school<br />\nopened in 1893, three of the original 18 M.D. candidates<br />\nwere women.<br /><br />\n11 '<br />\n\"Frankly, I find you rather immature.\"<br /><br />\nAnd in the spring of 1907 other University departments<br />\nfollowed suit as Hopkins became \"the last of the great<br />\ngraduate institutions in the country to admit women.\"<br />\nA few women appeared among the first faculty<br />\nmembers of the Medical School, and a few female<br />\nlecturers appeared from time to time. But not until 1916<br />\ndid the first full-professor-to-be appear in the Division of<br />\nArts and Sciences.<br />\nDr. Florence Eilau Bamberger came to Hopkins<br />\nfrom Columbia, with her Ph.D. in the philosophy of<br />\neducation. By 1924 she had been -appointed a full<br />\nprofessor; later she became director of the College of<br />\nTeachers at the University. Dr. Bamberger worked for<br />\nthe instruction of educators and in child-centered<br />\nteaching. She wrote prolifically and lectured around the<br />\nworld.<br />\nBesides being a scholar, Bamberger was a dedicated<br />\nfeminist. In a 1933 interview the Sun reported that \"Dr.<br />\nBamberger has only scorn for the current fashion of<br />\nsnubbing female intellectuals and mingles pride with<br />\nmild resentment that she is the lone woman professor<br />\n(at) Homewood...\" The writer continued, \"She looks<br />\nforward to the day when the pedantic male will be taken<br />\ndown a peg or so by his ambitious sisters.\"<br />\nBamberger participated in the great march for<br />\nwomen's suffrage in 1914; and when the 19th Amendment was finally added to the Constitution \"she regretted that she had only one vote to cast for Woodrow<br />\nWilson.\"<br />\nUndergraduate coeducation at Hopkins got off to a<br />\npromising start in February 1969. While students demonstrating against the Vietnam War marched outside, the<br />\nHopkins faculty met to seriously consider the question<br />\nof admitting women undergraduates. A News-Letter<br />\nreporter in attendance duly noted, \"Most professors<br />\nwere clearly bored by the issue.\"<br />\nAlthough most faculty members eventually favored<br />\ncoeducation, opinion was divided at first. Some agreed<br />\nwith Dr. Kerr that admitting women would raise the<br />\nenrollment in the Humanities and the social sciences at<br />\nthe expense of the sciences and engineering (it did not).<br />\nDr. Jack Green of the History department \"defended\"<br />\nthe principle of coeducation on the grounds that women<br />\nwould occasion more academic interest because \"boys<br />\n(would have to) work in order to keep above the girls.\"<br />\nWhen the Academic Council officially recommended that undergraduate women be admitted to Hopkins,<br />\nthen-University President Lincoln Gordon appointed a<br />\nTask Force on Coeducation to explore the question and<br />\nto make recommendations. The Committee came out in<br />\nfavor of admitting undergraduate women for several<br />\nreasons: (1) enrolling women would actually increase<br />\nthe size of the pool of qualified applicants (it did);(2)<br />\nincrease the diversity of courses in the Humanities<br />\nespecially (it did not);(3) improve the intellectual and<br />\nsocial environment of the campus. (did it?)<br />\nThere were those Hopkins men who protested the<br />\nproposed onslaught of women. One student complained<br />\nthat \"the Hopkins coed shall displace an otherwise<br />\nwell-qualified man from attending Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity...the femme fatale on campus today, at best,<br />\nonly will be some struggling professional's chief cook<br />\nand bottle washer tomorrow.\"<br />\nAnother objected that \"the aura of ravishing fair<br />\nyoung maidens billowing down the valleys of the quad is<br />\na myth. The woman brought to Hopkins would only<br />\nbe...a female version of the C-Level technocrat grinding<br />\naway...'Romance' and 'Hopkins' seem mutually exclusive (to me)...\"<br />\nBut cooler heads prevailed, and on October 14,<br />\n1969, the Board of Trustees officially approved the<br />\ncoedification of Johns llopkins University, breaking the<br />\n93-year-old undergraduate sex harrier.<br />\nHopkins had never gone coed before and didn't<br />\nknow quite how to go about it. Although female graduate students had been attending the University for the<br />\npast 62 years, Hopkins still lacked such basic necessities<br />\nas adequate housing (no dorms); enough lavatories for<br />\nwomen; gynecological services at the Infirmary; and an<br />\norganization to deal specifically' with the problems coeds<br />\nwould face. The official University answer to all these<br />\nshortcomings was to be \"flexible\" until such time as a<br />\nreal need was demonstrated.<br />\nBecause of housing problems the first undergraduate<br />\nwomen to attend Hopkins were 21 freshmen from the<br />\nBaltimore area, some of whom would commute; while<br /><br />\nthe rest, along with 69 transfer students, would be<br />\nlodged in then all-graduate McCoy Hall. According to<br />\nMike Hill, N-L reporter and erstwhile leader of one of<br />\nthe women's segregated orientation groups, Hopkins<br />\nmen \"responded to their presence with the brazen<br />\nbehavior which has marked the appearance of females on<br />\ncampus in previous years.\" He did not elaborate.<br />\nThe first women undergraduates received a peculiar<br />\nsort of attention from their male fellow students which<br />\nwas not always appreciated:<br />\n\"When you walk into a small class, all conversation<br />\nstops and 38 coordinated eyeballs follow you to your<br />\nseat...If you sit down in a big lecture hall, nobody will<br />\nsit next to you until all the other seats are taken--we call<br />\nit the Island Theory...You feel like a cross between<br />\nGypsy Roselee and Typhoid Mary.\"<br />\nOne student commented, \"In the beginning most<br />\nmen went out of their way to be courteous to women<br />\nstudents to the point of abnormality. We received a lot<br />\nof attention.\" For example, she said, a male student<br />\nwould pass through a doorway, suddenly realize that the<br />\ndoor was about to slam in the face of the woman behind<br />\nhim and would rush to stop it before it could.<br />\nOnce they had settled in, Hopkins women did not<br />\nhesitate long before responding to the more blatant signs<br />\nof discrimination around them. On October 6, 1970, the<br />\nNews-Letter ran the first letter written by a female<br /><br />\nstudent objecting to its sexist policies. The writer<br />\ncriticized an ad featuring \"a halfclothed 'chick' simpering under the macho gaze of a naked-torsoed stud.\" It<br />\ncontinued, \"By printing such bullshit sexist ads, you are<br />\nperpetuating the oppression and dehumanization of<br />\nwomen.\"<br />\nOne response to sexism and to the needs of undergraduate women was to include women's studies courses<br />\nin the curriculum. In 1971 Emily Toth, a graduate<br />\nstudent in comparative literature, tried to set up a course .<br />\nin \"Literary Perspectives on Women.\" The Humanities<br />\ndepartment approved, provided the course be taught on<br />\na non-credit basis--because they felt that Mrs. Toth, who<br />\nhad supported her family for three years teaching. at<br />\nMorgan State--would \"overburden\" herself by teaching<br />\none credit course while studying at Hopkins. In an<br />\nabrupt change of face, a News-Letter editorial commended Toth for \"undertaking something special for<br />\nand about and by women.\"<br />\nUndergraduate complaints of discrimination moved<br />\ngraduate students to examine their own situation with<br /><br />\nI be<br />\ng to<br />\nte of<br />\nlkins<br />\nazen<br />\n.s on<br />\nrate.<br />\nuliar<br />\n'hich<br /><br />\nition<br />\nyour<br />\nwill<br />\ncall<br />\nYeen<br /><br />\nmost<br />\nmen<br />\na lot<br />\ndent<br />\nt the<br />\nrhind<br /><br />\nI not<br />\nsigns<br />\nI, the<br />\nmale<br /><br />\nrriter<br />\nriper.\" It<br />\nu are<br />\n1 of<br /><br />\nrider''<br />\nu rses<br />\njuate<br />\nJU rse<br />\nities<br />\n[it on<br />\nwho<br />\nrig at<br />\n:hing<br />\nall<br />\ncornI for<br /><br />\nroved<br />\nwith<br /><br />\nrespect to their professors and peers. They objected that<br />\nonly 25% of those graduate students admitted were<br />\nwomen. Graduate Nr, men demanded more -;ourses,<br />\ne centers; fairer distribution of<br />\nbetter instruction, da.,<br />\nfellowships and more women faculty members as role<br />\nmodels.<br />\nThe first woman coeds graduated from Hopkins in<br />\n1974. Some women,m io felt that as a class their experiences were unique and interesting, organized a commit-tee to write a speech for graduation. They sent out a<br />\nsurvey asking their fe, Ile classmates about their impressions of undergraduate life. Although responses varied,<br />\nthe general consensus seems to be summed up in the<br />\nwords of one of the first transfer students:<br />\n\"One thing which this class of women learned, I<br />\nfeel, is to be stronger. The very fact that all gains for<br />\nwomen had to be fought for actively...has given us a<br />\nbasis for examining some of the more insidious ways<br />\nwomen are treated in the society as a whole...Although<br />\nI still have misgivings...I think Hopkins has developed<br />\ninto a more egalitarian institution than my other school,<br />\nwhere they were not forced to confront their attitudes<br />\nand change them.\"<br />\nNot to be outdone by our feminist predecessors, we<br />\nconducted our own survey of Hopkins women, undergraduates and graduates alike. The five questions we<br />\nasked drew a variety of often quite startling responses:<br />\n1. Why did you come to Hopkins? Did the male/female ratio affect your decision?<br />\nThe reasons most women gave for coming to<br />\nHopkins were those that might attract any male applicant: reputation of the school or of the department,<br />\ngenerous financial aid, small class size, etc. Most said<br />\nthat although the male/female ratio did not affect<br />\ntheir actual decision to apply, it didn't bother them too<br />\nmuch either. There were a few exceptions:<br />\n\"I'm here first socially--then academically.\"<br />\n\"I thought it would give me the right to be choosy<br />\nand the center of attraction.\"<br /><br />\n2. How do you think Hopkins women are viewed<br />\nby their male peers? By male professors?<br />\nResponses on this question varied widely, and might<br />\nbest be expressed by a sampling of quotes:<br />\n\"Men don't notice women, basically because we<br />\ndon't make enough noise. People don't even know we're<br />\ncoed yet.\"<br />\n\"Professors are easily duped. They will bend over<br />\nbackwards for us. It's an advantage I like and exploit.\"<br />\n\"Women have an advantage in the Humanities<br />\nbecause they are taught to be more humane.\"<br />\n\"Hopkins men have a respect for Hopkins women<br />\nintellectually but'not socially, which I find strange...It<br />\nmay be that they are scared of the intelligence and<br />\nsophistication of Hopkins women.\"<br />\n\"Women are viewed by the majority as wanting to<br />\nlatch onto a guy.. they aren't supposed to be really<br />\nserious about their work. The men set up the stereotype<br />\nand the women fulfill it.\"<br />\n3. How do Hopkins women feel about Hopkins<br />\nWomen?<br /><br />\nMost freshman women seemed to view other women<br />\nas social and academic competition. A minority expressed a desire for more female companionship. Among the<br />\nupper classes and graduate students the trend was<br />\nentirely opposite--women would seem to \"look to each<br />\nother for support,\" to form close community or family-type relationships. Yet perhaps because of the male/female ratio, many women said that they had more close<br />\nfriendships with men than women.<br />\n\"I feel that we (female graduate students) can cope<br />\nwith the pressures of Hopkins better than the male<br />\ngraduate student. Because we're doing something non-traditional, we know pretty much when we arrive what<br />\nkind of shit we'll have to face.\"<br />\n\"Hopkins women don't know Hopkins women. We<br />\nare too isolated from one another. I think all women<br />\nwould like to see more women here.\"<br />\n4. How do you feel about being a woman student<br />\nat Hopkins?<br />\nUndergraduate women pereived that .their sex made<br />\na difference socially but not academically. Graduate<br />\nwomen expressed a definite awareness that their gender<br />\naffected their academic existence at Hopkins.<br />\n\"There's a lot more happening here for girls than<br />\nguys. A small number of girls makes participation in<br />\nactivities like the Glee Club and the Drama department<br />\ndependent on interest and not ability.\"<br />\n\"When you finally do accomplish something in<br />\ncompetition with men there is a greater sense of victory.<br />\nNot a personal victory, but a social victory.\"<br />\nWomen offered suggestions including more Affirmative Action hiring, particularly to provide faculty role<br />\nmodels for women.<br />\n\"There are no real women get-togethers here. And<br />\nthere should be. But they should avoid the stigma of<br />\nwomen's lib. Maybe we could get together to learn<br />\nself-sufficiency. It would be nice if guys were there too<br />\nbecause we would be in a non-competitive and non-social atmosphere.\"<br />\nWe wanted to interview another segment of the<br />\nfemale population--women faculty and administration--to find out about their accomplishments and their<br />\nviews regarding Hopkins women in general.<br />\nDr. Ghilaine Godenne is director of Counseling and<br />\nPsychiatric Services for the University. She has been part<br />\nof Hopkins for 22 years, has worked in the White House<br />\nfor the last six, and was the first woman staff resident in<br />\nthe School of Medicine.<br />\nGodenne said that as far as undergraduates are<br />\nconcerned, women are much better off now than when<br />\ncoeducation began.\"Women are much more competitive<br />\nnow than before. Then they were continuously looked<br />\nat to see how they would do...but there is still discrimination. Women have to achieve more than men in order to<br />\nget the same benefits.\"<br />\nShe felt the male/female ratio is \"much worse on<br />\nthe males...The academic competition makes dating an<br />\ninfrequent pleasure.\"<br />\nGodenne said that the greatest problem for Hopkins<br />\nwomen is the conflict between the traditional wife-mother role and that of a professional working woman.<br />\n\"Most women don't realize they can have both even if<br />\nthis involves some sacrifices.\"<br />\nGodenne cited the ridiculously low number of<br />\nwomen faculty members as a prime example of current<br />\ndiscrimination. Although Hopkins compares favorably<br />\nwith other Ivy League schools in terms of per cent of<br />\nwomen faculty, the vast majority of these women hold<br />\nlower-echelon positions.<br />\n\"Kindness of heart, keenness of mind have made<br />\nCarrie May Kurrelmeyer Zintl a devoted alumnus and a<br />\nbeloved world citizen.\" In 1978, the JHU Alumni<br />\nAssociation made this award to Dr. Carrie Zintl, guest<br />\nlecturer and a senior member of the faculty.<br />\nDr. Zintl took her Ph.D. in German and Classics at<br />\nHopkins at 24. Though she was one of only a few<br />\nwomen students, Dr. Zintl feels that she was always<br />\ntreated with respect. She believes in hard work as a<br />\nremedy for discrimination: \"If you do your work,<br />\nI've found there are no distinctions made. If you can<br /><br />\ndeliver the goods you come out all right.\"<br />\nDr. Phoebe Stanton, professor and chairperson of<br />\nthe History of Art Department, discussed her work and<br />\nher relations with the students. She came to Hopkins in<br />\n'62 having earned her doctorate at the University of<br />\nLondon under renowned architect Nikolaus Pevsner. She<br />\nhas published two books and numerous journal articles<br />\nand lectures nationwide.<br />\nOf special interest to Dr. Stanton is the practical<br />\napplication of her researches. She serves on various<br />\nurban planning boards where her knowledge of architecture comes into play. And she teaches. \"I love the<br />\nstudents. They're why you're here. They remember the<br />\ncourses, the works of art...that makes it all worthwhile.\"<br />\nToday women undergraduates are working both on<br />\ntheir own and through campus organizations to achieve<br />\ntheir goals. While some groups in which women participate continue to be strongly supported, others have<br />\ndeclined since the early '70's. The Women's Athletic<br />\nProgram is one of the success stories. Hopkins now hosts<br />\nnot one but seven varsity teams--in field hockey, tennis,<br />\nfencing, squash, swimming, basketball and lacrosse.<br />\nWomen athletes express varying views about the<br />\nstate of women's sports at Hopkins. While most feel that<br />\nfaculties and budgeting are now proportionately equal to<br />\nthose allotted to men, a few complain about inconvenient practice times, frequent turnover of coaches and<br />\ndifficulties in getting new sports started.<br />\nSome women stressed that because the program is<br />\nnot very developed, there is no necessity for stardom.<br />\n\"Sports here function on the principle of interest, not<br />\nthe principle of ability,\" one student said.<br />\nThe Women's Center, however, has not progressed<br />\nas far. It is no longer the radical organization created by<br />\nthe first women undergraduates. The Center is less active<br />\nin undergraduate concerns, perhaps because the undergraduates demonstrate a little interest in the Center.<br />\nA spokesperson for the Center attributes undergraduate apathy to the fact that they are not as strongly affected by role conflicts which society commonly<br />\nimposes on women. She felt Hopkins undergrads are<br />\n\"very concerned academically but apolitical and apathetic.\"<br />\n\"Undergraduate women tend to believe that sexism<br />\nhas been conquered and do not see that discrimination<br />\ntoday is not blatant, but subtle,\"she concluded.<br />\nThe first undergraduate women knew just how<br />\nmuch they had achieved, but they felt a need to affirm<br />\ntheir position and suggest a future orientation. In 1974,<br />\nthe founders of the Women's Center planned a series of<br />\nspeakers and events for women. Entitled Next Step: A<br />\nFestival of Women, it was aimed at celebrating the<br />\npresent and potential role of women in today's world.<br />\nThe program coicided with the graduation of the first<br />\nfour-year coed class.<br />\nThe featured speakers included poet Anne Sexton<br />\nand Jane Fonda. Sissy Farenthold, a Texas state legislator and the National Women's Caucus Chairperson,<br />\nspoke on the problems of women in America, addressing<br />\nher talk to Hopkins women:<br />\n\"I think that for women at Hopkins, especially the<br />\nmembers of the first four-year coeducational class, there<br />\ncomes first a need for awareness, for without awareness<br />\nyou can't know what you are about. Then there's a place<br />\nfor assertiveness, and a time for audacity.\"<br /><br />\nRepresentatives of the women in the first coeducational class were invited to speak on their experiences at<br />\ntheir Commencement ceremonies. They chose to focus<br />\nthe close of their speech on what, after all, seemed the<br />\nmost important aspect of their undergraduate experience:<br />\n\"We, in this graduating class, were the instruments<br />\nof change. Our unique experiences, however, have not<br />\nprevented us from maintaining our high ambitions. We<br />\nplan to make our education productive, to utilize it<br />\nbeyond this level. Eighty per cent of the women graduating today are going on in higher education and then<br />\nprofessional careers. We will be the doctors, scientists,<br />\nlawyers, politicians and professors of tomorrow. We as<br />\nwomen hope to continue to work towards abolishing<br />\nsocial stereotypes for ourselves and others, as this<br />\nsociety begins to acknowledge the capabilities of all its<br />\nmembers.\"<br /><br />\nPAGE 10 I APRIL 13, 1979<br /><br />\nWizardry<br />\nThe following is an excerpt from the fourteenth<br />\nbicentennial report of the agent Saurak to the monitoring committee of the planet Euremia.<br />\n...I have had occasion to observe a mew form of<br />\nworship which has recently arisen on this planet, already<br />\nso replete with a variety of peculiar mystic practices.<br />\nThe chapel of this religion at the University currently<br />\nunder my surveillance is located down the hall and<br />\naround the corner from the Office of the Chaplain,<br />\nwhich apparently is the official organ assigned to exercise a general supervision over all such spiritual activities.<br />\nWhile the new practice does share some of the characteristics of the antique religions, it takes a unique flavor<br />\nfrom the use of the recently-improved if still primitive<br />\ntechnology on the planet.<br />\nThe chief rite consists of the worship of a silver ball,<br />\nafter which the sect takes its name,\"pinball.\" There are<br />\nabout .10 such balls in the whole chapel at Johns Hopkins, each encased in its own glass and wood housing.<br />\nThey remain out of sight, cloistered in these boxes until<br />\nsomeone comes in to make a donation and pray.<br />\nThe practice of this pinball is standardi7ed to a high<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nBrilliantly-lit beauties adorn<br />\nmany of these machines.<br />\ndegree. The ball appeal s, in the presence ut tlic<br />\nshipper for a period of about a minute at a time. During<br />\nthis session, the cult follower enters a trance-like state of<br />\nintense concentration, and dares not remove his eyes<br />\nfrom the silver orb as it rolls along inside the box.<br />\nFrequently he will also shake his body, nudge the ball's<br />\nhousing, and manipulate a pair of electric levers as he<br />\nattempts to retain the ball within his view. Fortunately<br />\nfor the worshipper, however, these efforts invariably<br />\nprove futile because the machines containing the balls<br />\nare designed not to allow them to remain exposed for<br />\nexcessive periods of time. Evidently brevity of the<br />\nprayer session is a critical aspect of pinball practice,<br />\nsince the technicians assigned to care for the balls<br />\nand their machines always adjust, disconnect, or remove<br />\nthem immediately should it become possible for the<br />\nworshipper to view the ball for a protracted period of<br />\ntime. My conjecture is that the reasons behind this are<br />\ntwofold. Physiological effects such as rapid heart rate<br /><br />\nand sudden secretions of the sweat glands of the palms<br />\nand armpits observed in the worshippers while the balls<br />\nare in view indicate that the mystic trance is characterized by a high stress level which might prove detrimental to the follower's health if sustained over long<br />\ntime periods. The short prayer time also facilitates access<br />\nto the sacred balls by a large number of people and<br />\nreduces the time necessary for them to wait before<br />\nperforming their devotions.<br />\nWhile the ball is'in view (it is protected by the glass<br />\ncasing of the housing so that no one can ever be so<br />\nprofane as to touch it), its machine emits noises and<br />\nflashes lights evidently calculated to have some significance for the initiated devotee. The tones produced vary<br />\nfrom one machine to another. Some make rapid bursts<br />\nat high frequencies which resemble the sounds made by<br />\nthe archaic gunpowder-operated automatic weapons<br />\nused in warfare on this planet, but most simply utter<br />\nbell-like noises similar to those which can sometimes<br />\nbe heard on the devices they use to receive video transmissions emanating frem the western coast of the United<br />\nStates. That these sounds have some symbolic importance for the practice of pinball is confirmed by the<br />\nfact that followers who have spent the largest amounts<br />\nof time in prayer are also the ones who hear the most<br />\nnoises while they are worshipping. It is also interesting<br />\nto note that these most faithful adherents are permitted<br />\nto view the sacred ball longer than newcomers. This of<br />\ncourse is due to the physical conditioning built up in<br />\nthese individuals over a large number of prayer sessions,<br />\nwhich permits them to better withstand the rigors of the<br />\npinball services. It also serves as a clever and effective<br />\nmeans of rewarding longtime members of the sect, who<br />\ntake an extreme pride in their exalted status within the<br />\npinball congregation.<br />\nNow, as I mentioned a moment ago, the sacred ball<br />\ninvariably returns to its resting place inside the wooden<br />\nhousing. But that event does not immediately mark the<br />\nend of the prayer session. It appears obligatory for the<br />\nworshipper to make some gesture of thanks to the<br />\nmachine for having provided him with a few moments of<br />\nenrapfured ball-viewing. This portion of the rite allows<br />\nmembers more freedom in their manner of praise, which<br />\ncan take the form of any of a large number of sometimes<br />\nbizarre rituals. One very common method followed by<br />\nmany worshippers is to curse and blaspheme against the<br />\ngods of the planet's other religions, which is a way of<br />\nexpressing thanks for having rejected them for the richer<br />\nmode of experience offered by pinball. Other means Of<br />\nperforming the closing rite can be more physical. Some<br />\nshove the machine in a magnified version of the nudges<br />\nperformed while the ball is in view, while others follow a<br />\ncustom which to me makes little sense but is nevertheless for some reason among the most popular--they<br />\npound ferociously on the glass cover which protects the<br />\nsacred ball.<br />\nAs you will recall, the inhabitants of the planet in<br />\nthe vicinity of the Euphrates River several thousand<br />\nEarth-orbits ago used to employ in their religion, sexual<br />\nrelations with their priestess as part of their sacred<br />\nreligious rites. While such libidinous activity has been<br />\nintensively suppressed by the religious institutions<br />\nhereabouts for the past two millenia, pinball reprewnts a<br />\nreturn to an emphasis on sex in worship. In fact, sex is<br />\none of the primary elements of symbolism in the new<br />\nreligion. Brilliantly-lit drawings of handsome males and<br />\nalluring female figures adorn the majority of the ballholding machines. And when a worshipper has the ball<br /><br />\ndisappear from view after an ecstatic if brief prayer<br />\nsession, he can often be heard tc claim.

Blank<br />\nwas also a double winner, taking<br />\nthe 100-yard breaststroke in<br />\naddition to a victory in the<br />\n200-yard event. Doug Moya won<br />\nthe 200-yard butterfly and Tim<br />\nCollins successfully defended his<br />\ntitle in the 1650-yard freestyle<br />\nwhich, when added to the team's<br />\n400-yard medley relay, gave the<br />\nBlue Jays a meet-record of seven<br />\nchampionships.<br />\nCoach Tim Welsh was also<br />\nnamed coach of the year in<br />\nDivision III.<br />\nAs usual, the title was the<br />\nresult of supreme effort and<br />\npreparation from both team<br />\nmembers and coaching staff.<br />\nOne unique portion of this<br />\nyear's program which Coach<br />\nWelsh plans to include in each<br />\ntraining season is a course<br />\nentitled \"Creative-Performance\"<br />\ndevoted to mental preparation in<br />\nathletic performance. Its goal is<br />\nto prepare the athlete to mentally expect the performance he<br />\nwishes to achieve physically.<br />\nWelsh feels that this program<br />\nhas been a big help in the season<br />\nand is planning to keep \"Creative Performance\" as part of<br />\nfuture swimming seasons. \"It is<br />\nnot a magic formula,\" says<br /><br />\nWelsh.\"There is no course in the<br />\nworld that will take a fifth grade<br />\nathlete and make him a world<br />\nchampion. But what it will do,<br />\ndid do, can do and does do is to<br />\nallow you to discover what your<br />\nown abilities, potentials and<br />\nexcellences might be and achieve<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nWelsh said the course allows<br />\ngoals that they can see themselves achieving, then teaches<br />\nthem to achieve that goal.<br />\nmentally.<br />\nThe individuals, however,<br />\ncomprise a team. And Welsh<br />\nfeels that being part of a team<br />\nallows the swimmers to achieve a<br />\nlarge portion of the excellent<br />\nperformance which they repeated this season. \"The Johns<br />\nHopkins swimming team is a<br />\nteam, but on this team there<br />\nhappens to be a lot of fast<br />\nindividuals. Without either one<br />\nof those we would not have<br />\nwhat we have.

The course deals with<br />\nthe scientific data that the mind<br />\nhas a hard time distinguishing<br />\nbetween something that actually<br />\nhappened and something vividly<br />\nimagined, as when one gets<br />\nfrightened from something in<br />\nthe dark which does not actually<br />\nexist.

In 19 out of 23 events, Hopkins<br />\nswimmers went faster in the<br />\nfinals than in the morning<br />\npreliminaries. Welsh feels that<br />\nthis, more than anything else,<br />\nseparates a good national performance from a great national<br />\nperformance. He bases this on<br />\nthree factors.\"The first, without<br />\nwhich there is nothing, is that<br />\nyou must have done the work.<br />\nBy and large, all other things<br />\naside, the team with the most<br />\nhigh quality work over the<br />\nlongest period of time is the<br />\nteam that will win. When we<br />\nwent to the meet confident that<br />\nwe had done as much work as<br />\nany team in the nation, we were<br />\nready to say we were ready. And<br />\nhaving done the preparation, we<br />\nknew we could do it. We were<br />\nconfident, and that's the \"team\"<br />\nstuff. That comes from having<br />\n17 guys at the meet rather than<br />\nhaving two or three.<br />\n\"It's also a result of having<br />\nswimmers early in the meet to<br />\ndo it.

Gregory<br />\njumped out of the crease to<br />\nlevel no fewer than five Hopkins<br />\noffenders, while drawing no<br />\npenalty time.<br />\nAlso leveled in the contest<br />\nwas Leroy Katz, who was<br />\nknocked out by the Wahoo's<br />\nBato Pellington. Pellington, Virginia's top scorer, assisted once<br />\nand scored two goals in a fine<br />\neffort, but angered the Hopkins<br />\ncrowd when he tapped Leroy<br />\nwith his stick and asked him<br />\nif he was alright.

Cornell is still undefeated in four NCAA contests, after<br />\nthe Jays broke their 42-game<br />\nstreak last May.
