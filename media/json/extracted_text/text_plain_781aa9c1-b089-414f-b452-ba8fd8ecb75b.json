It was estimated that the new<br />\nbuilding would cost approximately $300,000. Of this amount, the<br />\nsum of $200,000 has already been<br />\nsubscribed. The results thus far<br />\nhave fulfilled the hopes and expectations of the campaign committee. They had planned to<br />\nraise $200,000 from the alumni<br />\nand students, and then use this<br />\nexample of spirit and unselfishness as an argument to induce<br />\nsome of Hopkins' wealthier<br />\nfriends to contribute the remaining $100,000. The amount subscribed represents the gifts of the<br />\nalumni of moderate means. Sixty<br />\nper cent, of all the men who received their degrees at Hopkins<br />\nhave contributed.<br />\nThe $200,000 mark was reached<br />\nat the Alumni Association's banquet, held recently at the Southern<br />\nHotel. On this occasion $45,000<br />\nwas raised. Dr. Herbert Friedenwald, '90, and W. Stuart Symington,' 91, subscribed liberally. Both<br />\nof these men made informal addresses in behalf of the dormitory<br />\nfund.<br />\nA luncheon was held at the Merchants' Club last Saturday, at<br />\nwhich the Dormitory Committee<br />\nreviewed the situation in regard<br />\nto raising the final $100,000. Mr.<br />\nGeorge L.

Mr. George L.<br />\nRadcliffe, formerly president of<br />\nthe association, was toastmaster.<br />\nThe speakers were: Governor<br />\nRitchie, '96; Dr. Hugh H. Young,<br />\nPresident Goodnow, Sir Arthur<br />\nNewsholme and Mr. George W.<br />\nKnapp, '99. Mr. Knapp was recently elected president of the<br />\nassociation for the coming term.<br />\nSeveral informal speeches on the<br />\ndormitory campaign were made by<br />\nprominent alumni, including Dr.<br />\nHerbert Friedenwald,'90, and W.<br />\nStuart Symington, '91. It was<br />\nmainly through the effort of these<br />\nmen that $45,000 was subscribed<br />\nat this gathering: The banquet<br />\nwas characterized by much \"pep\"<br />\nand enthusiasm.<br />\n<br />\nThe Point Winners<br />\nOPEN EVENTS.<br />\nPrinceton<br />\nMeadowbrook<br />\nVirginia<br />\nPenn State<br />\nUnattached<br />\nYale<br />\nGilman<br />\nGeorgetown<br />\nCatholic University<br />\nPenn<br />\nLafayette<br />\nHopkins<br />\nSwarthmore<br />\nTome<br />\nCentral High<br />\nSOUTH ATLANTIC.<br />\nGeorgetown<br />\nWashington and Lee<br />\nVirginia<br />\nHopkins<br />\n<br />\n05<br />\n19<br />\n17<br />\n6<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n30<br />\n17<br />\n6<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nBefore a crowd much larger<br />\nthan those of previous years, and<br />\nwith a record entry list of athletes, representing the leading<br />\nschools,colleges and universities of<br />\nthe country, the fifteenth annual<br />\nJohns Hopkins-Fifth Regiment indoor games were held last Saturday night at the Fifth Regiment<br />\nArmory. Princeton, represented<br />\nby such men as Penfield, Lourie,<br />\nMassey and Murray, had the<br />\nhonor of winning the team trophy,<br />\nwith 25 points; while the Meadowbrook Club, of Philadelphia, was<br />\nsecond, with 19, and the University of Virginia was third, with<br />\n17. Hopkins got only one point.<br />\nIn the South Atlantic collegiate<br />\nevents, Georgetown was easily victor, taking 30 points. Hopkins<br />\nwas fourth, with four.<br />\nUndoubtedly, the feature event<br />\nof the evening was the 'Varsity<br />\nClub 1,000-yard special invitation<br />\nrace. This, soon after the start,<br />\ndeveloped into almost a dead heat<br />\nbetween Reed, of Yale, and Crawford, of Lafayette. The former<br />\nwas in the lead at the beginning<br />\nof the home stretch, but seemed to<br />\nbe tiring, when the Lafayette man,<br />\nwith a sudden burst of speed, came<br />\nalongside of him, and seemed<br />\nabout to pass. Becoming desperate, Reed made a last great effort,<br />\nand broke the tape an inch ahead.<br />\nIrwin, of Penn, was third. This<br />\nrace was by far the most thrilling<br />\nof the meet; the spectators were<br />\non their feet from start to finish,<br />\nand cheer after cheer rang out as<br />\nfirst one man and then another<br />\ngained a few feet.<br />\nClarence Wheelwright, representing Gilman, pulled a surprise<br />\nby winning the open 220-yard dash<br />\nfrom a field of older and mOre experienced runners.<br />\nConnolly, of Georgetown, had<br />\nlittle difficulty in winning the<br />\n<br />\nArthur Emmart will speak on<br />\n\"John M.

All -those who heard<br />\nErnmart's previous paper will<br />\nsurely be present to enjoy his<br />\nforthcoming talk.<br />\nThe third of a series of public<br />\nlectures, under the auspices of the<br />\nclub, will take place on Wednesday afternoon, March 10, in the<br />\nCivil Engineering Hall, at 4.15<br />\no'clock. Dr. Bright, who needs<br />\nno introduction to Baltimoreans,<br />\nwill address the club on \"The Art<br />\nof Expression.\" It goes without<br />\nsaying that no more qualified'<br />\nspeaker for that subject could<br />\nhave been found. The lecture,<br />\nwhich is open to the public, has<br />\nbeen given much advertisement,<br />\nand a large audience is expected.<br />\nSince the Literary Club has no<br />\nmeans of financial support, other<br />\nthan the dues contributed by members, and since this amount proves<br />\ninadequate for securing out-oftown speakers, the club has decided to hold a benefit performance. The play selected is a musical comedy, entitled \"Twinkle,<br />\nTwinkle,\" at Ford's Opera House,<br />\non the evening of Thursday,<br />\nMarch 18. The Literary Club<br />\nneeds the support of the University in this benefit, if any money<br />\nis to be realized. Let every fellow<br />\nbe there, and may his \"fair one\"<br />\nnot be lacking. Tickets may be<br />\nhad from Reuben Foster or any<br />\nmember of the club. Buy early,<br />\nand exchange tickets for the best<br />\nseats on or after March 9.<br />\nSouth Atlantic mile by about 30<br />\nyards. \"Reds\" Mullikin, of Hopkins, stepped into the limelight<br />\nand took second place from Fitzgerald, also of Georgetown. For<br />\nsix laps he had run along at an<br />\neven gait in fourth place; he then<br />\nsuddenly \"opened up,\" quickly<br />\npassing into third place. He came<br />\neveh with the next man on the<br />\nlast turn and fairly flew away<br />\nfrom him on the straight-away,<br />\ndrawing' many cheers from the<br />\nHopkins rooters present.<br />\nIn the South Atlantic mile relay, Georgetown stepped quickly<br />\ninto the lead at the start and was<br />\nnever passed, although Thompson<br />\ngained some ground at the end for<br />\nHopkins, who finished second.<br />\nShields, running as anchor man<br />\nfor Penn in the medley race<br />\nagainst Lafayette, came within<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins basketeers<br />\navenged their baseball and football brothers last Friday night,<br />\nwhen they romped away with the<br />\nfray with St. John's, 23 to 13. The<br />\nlocal boys leaped to the fore with<br />\nthe whistle, and had no trouble in<br />\nretaining this advantage.<br />\nCapt. \"Joe\" Weiner's clever<br />\ndribbling and dodge-work was the<br />\nfeature of the evening's entertainment. Time and again he<br />\nsquirmed his way through the<br />\nwhole Orange and Black five, now<br />\nto score a difficult basket and<br />\nagain to shoot the leather to<br />\n\"Dutch\" Scheurich or \"Joe\" Cuneo, waiting under the net. The<br />\nteamwork of the entire quint<br />\nwas a vast improvement on that<br />\nexhibited on the armory floor in<br />\nthe last few games. Long shooting was lessened to a considerable<br />\ndegree, although Cuneo was unable to resist the impulse on several occasions to let fire at long<br />\nrange.<br />\nAs is witnessed by the number<br />\nof fouls called, the game was<br />\nrather rough, but hard, clean play<br />\nwas everywhere in evidence. Both<br />\nteams were fighting with every<br />\nounce of strength,;the Black and<br />\nBlue determined to win and the<br />\nCadets, fighting with their backs<br />\nto the wall, refused to yield an<br />\ninch. The outcome, however, was<br />\na foregone conclusion after the<br />\nfirst skirmish, for the ball was<br />\nalmost entirely flying around between Hopkins players.<br />\nThe guarding of the local basket<br />\nwas of a superb nature. Only<br />\nthree times were the visitors successful in penetrating the defense<br />\nand in finding the range of the<br />\nring\u2014twice in the first and once<br />\nin the second period.

No one, we hope,<br />\nwill oppose us in the declaration<br />\nthat it is the duty of every fullblooded Hopkins man to uphold<br />\nour University and any of its organizations in every case of unfair and unwarranted criticism.<br />\n1 We are unreservedly opposed to<br />\nany form of mud-slinging against<br />\nour institutions, regardless of<br />\nwhether the narrow-minded criticism is aimed at anything connected with Johns Hopkins or at<br />\nany other educational institution.<br />\nAdmiral William S. Sims, orator at the University Day exercises<br />\nof the University of Pennsylvania,<br />\ncriticized the tendency of Americans to resent adverse comment<br />\nupon anything American, even<br />\nwhen the pointing to errors is constructive. We agree with him,<br />\nand the \"Mail Bag\" gives the students the necessary opportunity<br />\nfor setting forth their views in<br />\nmatters pertaining to our University life.<br />\nWe confess ignorance as to the<br />\nofficial causes which led to the ac-<br />\n<br />\nceptance of the resignation of one<br />\nof our ablest and most popular instructors. We are sure, however,<br />\nthat Hopkins is not dying of dry<br />\nrot. The loss of one member of<br />\nthe faculty, or even of several members, is not an index of retrogression.<br />\nIn reply to Mr. Hamburger, we<br />\ndirect his attention to the fact<br />\nthat most of the universities<br />\nthroughout the United States suffer the annual loss of some of<br />\ntheir old professors. If this fact<br />\napplied only to the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, we would not hesitate<br />\nto agree with him. Both President Goodnow and the Hon. Mr.<br />\nHoover pointed out the defects<br />\nof the present educational system throughout this country. We<br />\nare not surprised, therefore, that<br />\nunder present conditions, many<br />\nprofessors can command in the<br />\nbusiness world double or even<br />\ntriple the salary they now receive.<br />\n\"This day you are taking the<br />\nvow of financial chastity!\" prophesied Dr. Maurice Bloomfield in a<br />\ncertain Commencement Day address to a group of men upon<br />\nwhom were conferred their Ph. D.<br />\ndegrees. How many professors<br />\nhave faithfully kept this vow?<br />\nWhen a professor finds that he is<br />\nunreasonably underpaid, it is not<br />\ncontrary to human nature for him<br />\nto forsake academic life for business life. It is only when the professor is adequately paid and then<br />\nquits that he has broken his vow.<br />\nWe commend the interest of Mr.<br />\nHamburger in the affairs of his<br />\nAlma Mater, but we deplore his<br />\nstatement that Hopkins is dying<br />\nof dry rot. Just criticism is helpful, and we would like to see more<br />\nof it. Let the critic first get the<br />\nfacts, be sure that there is foundation for criticism, and then express his views in a rational<br />\nmanner.<br />\nMUSICAL PROGRAM EXCELLENT<br />\n(Continued from page 5)<br />\n<br />\nlections: Symphonic poem,\"Snow<br />\nWhite,\" by Bendel; march from<br />\n\"Aida,\" by Verdi; \"The StarSpangled Banner\"; andante cantabile (string orchestra), by<br />\nTschaikowski; andante from violin concerto, by Mendelssohn (violin solo by Winthrop Phelps, of<br />\nthe Medical School); and \"America.\" The playing of Tschaikowski's andante cantabile and the<br />\nviolin solo by Winthrop Phelps,<br />\na medical student, were particularly fine.<br />\nAlthough a new organization,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Orchestra has<br />\nalready made a name for itself,<br />\nand it is up to the University as<br />\na whole to help maintain the<br />\nsplendid reputation which these<br />\nyoung musicians have gained.<br />\nEvery Hopkins student who has<br />\nthe slightest ability along musical<br />\nlines should do his part toward<br />\nkeeping the orchestra on the high<br />\nplane to which it has risen in its<br />\nrecent performances.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER'S MAILBAG<br />\nA Column in Which the Correspondents<br />\nAre Allowed Latitude, but Shoulder the Responsibility.<br />\n<br />\nQUACKS FROM A QUACK<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\nHas everybody taken careful<br />\nnote of the fact that a few greenhorn editors have been elected to<br />\n.the official staff?

It was estimated that the new<br />\nbuilding would cost approximately $300,000. Of this amount, the<br />\nsum of $200,000 has already been<br />\nsubscribed. The results thus far<br />\nhave fulfilled the hopes and expectations of the campaign committee. They had planned to<br />\nraise $200,000 from the alumni<br />\nand students, and then use this<br />\nexample of spirit and unselfishness as an argument to induce<br />\nsome of Hopkins' wealthier<br />\nfriends to contribute the remaining $100,000. The amount subscribed represents the gifts of the<br />\nalumni of moderate means. Sixty<br />\nper cent, of all the men who received their degrees at Hopkins<br />\nhave contributed.<br />\nThe $200,000 mark was reached<br />\nat the Alumni Association's banquet, held recently at the Southern<br />\nHotel. On this occasion $45,000<br />\nwas raised. Dr. Herbert Friedenwald, '90, and W. Stuart Symington,' 91, subscribed liberally. Both<br />\nof these men made informal addresses in behalf of the dormitory<br />\nfund.<br />\nA luncheon was held at the Merchants' Club last Saturday, at<br />\nwhich the Dormitory Committee<br />\nreviewed the situation in regard<br />\nto raising the final $100,000. Mr.<br />\nGeorge L.

Mr. George L.<br />\nRadcliffe, formerly president of<br />\nthe association, was toastmaster.<br />\nThe speakers were: Governor<br />\nRitchie, '96; Dr. Hugh H. Young,<br />\nPresident Goodnow, Sir Arthur<br />\nNewsholme and Mr. George W.<br />\nKnapp, '99. Mr. Knapp was recently elected president of the<br />\nassociation for the coming term.<br />\nSeveral informal speeches on the<br />\ndormitory campaign were made by<br />\nprominent alumni, including Dr.<br />\nHerbert Friedenwald,'90, and W.<br />\nStuart Symington, '91. It was<br />\nmainly through the effort of these<br />\nmen that $45,000 was subscribed<br />\nat this gathering: The banquet<br />\nwas characterized by much \"pep\"<br />\nand enthusiasm.<br /><br />\nThe Point Winners<br />\nOPEN EVENTS.<br />\nPrinceton<br />\nMeadowbrook<br />\nVirginia<br />\nPenn State<br />\nUnattached<br />\nYale<br />\nGilman<br />\nGeorgetown<br />\nCatholic University<br />\nPenn<br />\nLafayette<br />\nHopkins<br />\nSwarthmore<br />\nTome<br />\nCentral High<br />\nSOUTH ATLANTIC.<br />\nGeorgetown<br />\nWashington and Lee<br />\nVirginia<br />\nHopkins<br /><br />\n05<br />\n19<br />\n17<br />\n6<br />\n6<br /><br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n2<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n30<br />\n17<br />\n6<br />\n4<br /><br />\nBefore a crowd much larger<br />\nthan those of previous years, and<br />\nwith a record entry list of athletes, representing the leading<br />\nschools,colleges and universities of<br />\nthe country, the fifteenth annual<br />\nJohns Hopkins-Fifth Regiment indoor games were held last Saturday night at the Fifth Regiment<br />\nArmory. Princeton, represented<br />\nby such men as Penfield, Lourie,<br />\nMassey and Murray, had the<br />\nhonor of winning the team trophy,<br />\nwith 25 points; while the Meadowbrook Club, of Philadelphia, was<br />\nsecond, with 19, and the University of Virginia was third, with<br />\n17. Hopkins got only one point.<br />\nIn the South Atlantic collegiate<br />\nevents, Georgetown was easily victor, taking 30 points. Hopkins<br />\nwas fourth, with four.<br />\nUndoubtedly, the feature event<br />\nof the evening was the 'Varsity<br />\nClub 1,000-yard special invitation<br />\nrace. This, soon after the start,<br />\ndeveloped into almost a dead heat<br />\nbetween Reed, of Yale, and Crawford, of Lafayette. The former<br />\nwas in the lead at the beginning<br />\nof the home stretch, but seemed to<br />\nbe tiring, when the Lafayette man,<br />\nwith a sudden burst of speed, came<br />\nalongside of him, and seemed<br />\nabout to pass. Becoming desperate, Reed made a last great effort,<br />\nand broke the tape an inch ahead.<br />\nIrwin, of Penn, was third. This<br />\nrace was by far the most thrilling<br />\nof the meet; the spectators were<br />\non their feet from start to finish,<br />\nand cheer after cheer rang out as<br />\nfirst one man and then another<br />\ngained a few feet.<br />\nClarence Wheelwright, representing Gilman, pulled a surprise<br />\nby winning the open 220-yard dash<br />\nfrom a field of older and mOre experienced runners.<br />\nConnolly, of Georgetown, had<br />\nlittle difficulty in winning the<br /><br />\nArthur Emmart will speak on<br />\n\"John M.

All -those who heard<br />\nErnmart's previous paper will<br />\nsurely be present to enjoy his<br />\nforthcoming talk.<br />\nThe third of a series of public<br />\nlectures, under the auspices of the<br />\nclub, will take place on Wednesday afternoon, March 10, in the<br />\nCivil Engineering Hall, at 4.15<br />\no'clock. Dr. Bright, who needs<br />\nno introduction to Baltimoreans,<br />\nwill address the club on \"The Art<br />\nof Expression.\" It goes without<br />\nsaying that no more qualified'<br />\nspeaker for that subject could<br />\nhave been found. The lecture,<br />\nwhich is open to the public, has<br />\nbeen given much advertisement,<br />\nand a large audience is expected.<br />\nSince the Literary Club has no<br />\nmeans of financial support, other<br />\nthan the dues contributed by members, and since this amount proves<br />\ninadequate for securing out-oftown speakers, the club has decided to hold a benefit performance. The play selected is a musical comedy, entitled \"Twinkle,<br />\nTwinkle,\" at Ford's Opera House,<br />\non the evening of Thursday,<br />\nMarch 18. The Literary Club<br />\nneeds the support of the University in this benefit, if any money<br />\nis to be realized. Let every fellow<br />\nbe there, and may his \"fair one\"<br />\nnot be lacking. Tickets may be<br />\nhad from Reuben Foster or any<br />\nmember of the club. Buy early,<br />\nand exchange tickets for the best<br />\nseats on or after March 9.<br />\nSouth Atlantic mile by about 30<br />\nyards. \"Reds\" Mullikin, of Hopkins, stepped into the limelight<br />\nand took second place from Fitzgerald, also of Georgetown. For<br />\nsix laps he had run along at an<br />\neven gait in fourth place; he then<br />\nsuddenly \"opened up,\" quickly<br />\npassing into third place. He came<br />\neveh with the next man on the<br />\nlast turn and fairly flew away<br />\nfrom him on the straight-away,<br />\ndrawing' many cheers from the<br />\nHopkins rooters present.<br />\nIn the South Atlantic mile relay, Georgetown stepped quickly<br />\ninto the lead at the start and was<br />\nnever passed, although Thompson<br />\ngained some ground at the end for<br />\nHopkins, who finished second.<br />\nShields, running as anchor man<br />\nfor Penn in the medley race<br />\nagainst Lafayette, came within<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins basketeers<br />\navenged their baseball and football brothers last Friday night,<br />\nwhen they romped away with the<br />\nfray with St. John's, 23 to 13. The<br />\nlocal boys leaped to the fore with<br />\nthe whistle, and had no trouble in<br />\nretaining this advantage.<br />\nCapt. \"Joe\" Weiner's clever<br />\ndribbling and dodge-work was the<br />\nfeature of the evening's entertainment. Time and again he<br />\nsquirmed his way through the<br />\nwhole Orange and Black five, now<br />\nto score a difficult basket and<br />\nagain to shoot the leather to<br />\n\"Dutch\" Scheurich or \"Joe\" Cuneo, waiting under the net. The<br />\nteamwork of the entire quint<br />\nwas a vast improvement on that<br />\nexhibited on the armory floor in<br />\nthe last few games. Long shooting was lessened to a considerable<br />\ndegree, although Cuneo was unable to resist the impulse on several occasions to let fire at long<br />\nrange.<br />\nAs is witnessed by the number<br />\nof fouls called, the game was<br />\nrather rough, but hard, clean play<br />\nwas everywhere in evidence. Both<br />\nteams were fighting with every<br />\nounce of strength,;the Black and<br />\nBlue determined to win and the<br />\nCadets, fighting with their backs<br />\nto the wall, refused to yield an<br />\ninch. The outcome, however, was<br />\na foregone conclusion after the<br />\nfirst skirmish, for the ball was<br />\nalmost entirely flying around between Hopkins players.<br />\nThe guarding of the local basket<br />\nwas of a superb nature. Only<br />\nthree times were the visitors successful in penetrating the defense<br />\nand in finding the range of the<br />\nring\u2014twice in the first and once<br />\nin the second period.

Dr. Mitchell expressed his appreciation of his<br />\nelection to the post of honorary<br />\npresident, and continued with the<br />\nexpression of his wish to foster<br />\nthe right relation between teacher<br />\nand pupil\u2014a relation which the<br />\nteacher finds a hard one to maintain, for he cannot be too advancedly friendly with or hold<br />\naloof to too great an extent from<br />\nhis pupils without endangering<br />\nthe loss of the very friendship<br />\nwhich he seeks.

No one, we hope,<br />\nwill oppose us in the declaration<br />\nthat it is the duty of every fullblooded Hopkins man to uphold<br />\nour University and any of its organizations in every case of unfair and unwarranted criticism.<br />\n1 We are unreservedly opposed to<br />\nany form of mud-slinging against<br />\nour institutions, regardless of<br />\nwhether the narrow-minded criticism is aimed at anything connected with Johns Hopkins or at<br />\nany other educational institution.<br />\nAdmiral William S. Sims, orator at the University Day exercises<br />\nof the University of Pennsylvania,<br />\ncriticized the tendency of Americans to resent adverse comment<br />\nupon anything American, even<br />\nwhen the pointing to errors is constructive. We agree with him,<br />\nand the \"Mail Bag\" gives the students the necessary opportunity<br />\nfor setting forth their views in<br />\nmatters pertaining to our University life.<br />\nWe confess ignorance as to the<br />\nofficial causes which led to the ac-<br /><br />\nceptance of the resignation of one<br />\nof our ablest and most popular instructors. We are sure, however,<br />\nthat Hopkins is not dying of dry<br />\nrot. The loss of one member of<br />\nthe faculty, or even of several members, is not an index of retrogression.<br />\nIn reply to Mr. Hamburger, we<br />\ndirect his attention to the fact<br />\nthat most of the universities<br />\nthroughout the United States suffer the annual loss of some of<br />\ntheir old professors. If this fact<br />\napplied only to the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, we would not hesitate<br />\nto agree with him. Both President Goodnow and the Hon. Mr.<br />\nHoover pointed out the defects<br />\nof the present educational system throughout this country. We<br />\nare not surprised, therefore, that<br />\nunder present conditions, many<br />\nprofessors can command in the<br />\nbusiness world double or even<br />\ntriple the salary they now receive.<br />\n\"This day you are taking the<br />\nvow of financial chastity!\" prophesied Dr. Maurice Bloomfield in a<br />\ncertain Commencement Day address to a group of men upon<br />\nwhom were conferred their Ph. D.<br />\ndegrees. How many professors<br />\nhave faithfully kept this vow?<br />\nWhen a professor finds that he is<br />\nunreasonably underpaid, it is not<br />\ncontrary to human nature for him<br />\nto forsake academic life for business life. It is only when the professor is adequately paid and then<br />\nquits that he has broken his vow.<br />\nWe commend the interest of Mr.<br />\nHamburger in the affairs of his<br />\nAlma Mater, but we deplore his<br />\nstatement that Hopkins is dying<br />\nof dry rot. Just criticism is helpful, and we would like to see more<br />\nof it.
