GOODNOW.<br />\n<br />\n[This is the first of a series of articles written by members of the University faculty on problems and issues<br />\nof the war. It is fitting that the<br />\nPresident of the University, a worldfame i authority on political science<br />\nand government, should inaugurate<br />\nthis plan for educating undergraduates in the tremendous problems of<br />\nthe present day.

But<br />\nin August, 1)14, it was believed<br />\nthat the hour had struck. A short<br />\naggressive and successful war and<br />\nthe dream of centuries would be<br />\na reality.

For the Roman<br />\nwas willing, so long as his political power was recognized, to<br />\npermit conquered races to live in<br />\na condition of at least an approximation to social and economic<br />\nequality. The modern German,<br />\nhowever, declares with a contemptuous frankness all non-Teutonic<br />\ncivilization to be ' unworthy of<br />\nperpetuation and announces his<br />\nintention to disperse its degenerate followers to those parts of the<br />\nearth where they will least interfere with the spread of Deutsche<br />\nKultur. To him the Teutons are<br />\nthe people chosen of God to redeem the world. Those who resist<br />\nthe will of God are guilty of impiety and for them no fate is too<br />\nhard.

To teach her the lesson<br />\nshe must be taught will require<br />\nthe devotion of all the power of<br />\nthose allied against her.<br />\nThe non-German world is, then,<br />\nat the present time confronted by<br />\nan adversary who combines unbounding ambition and insufferable arrogance with unexampled<br />\nefficiency and unscrupulousness<br />\nwithout limit. We Americans, far<br />\nremoved as we are from the scene<br />\nof Germany's first efforts to realize her ambitions, form an important part of the non-Teutonic<br />\nworld. We must not lull ourselves into security because of the<br />\nremoteness of our geographical<br />\nsituation or the pacific character of our purposes. The Germans of the present day despise<br />\nour capacity, envy our prosperity,<br />\nand are not inclined to comply<br />\nwith our desire to pursue the even<br />\ntenor of our ways in the continents which we have colonized and<br />\ndeveloped.<br />\nWe have further in German pretensions a direct attack upon the<br />\nkind of life which we have chosen<br />\nto live. Two characteristics have<br />\ndistinguished the modern European life in which we have a<br />\nshare. The first is internationalism, the second is democracy.<br />\nInternationalism is the solution<br />\nwhich we have been endeavoring,<br />\nand successfully endeavoring, to<br />\nreach, of the problems incident<br />\nto the national state. The most<br />\nnoticeable phenomenon of mddern<br />\nEuropean political life has been<br />\nthe development of the national<br />\nstate. While the ideal of the national state has been only approximated, while all races have not<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 10, 1917.<br />\nbeen politically organized, and<br />\nwhile some races have found a<br />\nhome in more than one state, at<br />\nthe same time the co existence of<br />\na number of politically sovereign<br />\norganizations has of itself been a<br />\ndenial of the idea of world domination.<br />\nInternationalism is the method<br />\nwhich has been adopted for regulating the relations of these separate political organizations. Rules<br />\nof conduct have been generally<br />\nadopted to which all members of<br />\nthe family of nations have in the<br />\npast rendered obedience. . The<br />\nideal of internationalism\u2022 has, of<br />\ncourse, not been contpletely realized, but enough progress had been<br />\nmade prior to the outbreak of<br />\nthe present war to justify the belief that reasonable approximation to that ideal would ultimately be reached. No country perhaps in the past century has contributed more to the realization<br />\nof the ideals of internationalism<br />\nthan the United States. This<br />\ncountry has always stood for<br />\nthose principles the application of<br />\nwhich would, on the one hand, lessen the probability of the development of hostile relations between<br />\nstates, and, on the other, would<br />\noffer a means for the peaceful<br />\nsettlement of such disputes as<br />\nmight arrive. America's past history thus causes her to have a<br />\npeculiar interest in the further development of the principles of internationalism.<br />\nThe maintenance even of time<br />\naccepted principles of internationalism is, however, inconsistent<br />\nwith the conception of world control which is at present the mainspring of German policy. The policy cannot recognize any such<br />\nthing as equality among political<br />\ngroups. All must be subordinated<br />\nto the one great power. If, therefore, we are to hope for the further development of an international life we must fight to the<br />\ndeath German pretensions.<br />\nThe second characteristic of<br />\nmodern European life has been the<br />\ndevelopment of democracy. Democratic ideas originated in England. They were brought to this<br />\ncountry when it was colonized and<br />\nreceived a development which was<br />\nhardly dreamed of in the land of<br />\ntheir birth. Thence they spread<br />\nto France and through France to<br />\nmost of Western Europe. The<br />\nseeds of democratic ideas fell,<br />\nhowever, in Germany among the<br />\nthorns of autocratic government<br />\nand the thorns sprung up and<br />\nchoked them. Just as the French<br />\nRevolution and the Napoleonic<br />\nwars brought democracy to most<br />\nof Western Europe, so the present<br />\nwar has given it to Russia, where<br />\nautocracy in its extreme form had<br />\nbeen able to maintain itself.<br />\nWe have, therefore, allied<br />\nagainst German autocracy practically all of Western Europe, together with Japan, Russia and the<br />\nUnited States. If the autocratic<br />\ngovernments of the Central Powers are successful in this war, de-<br />\n<br />\nmocracy will be judged a failure<br />\nand the struggle and agony of<br />\ncenturies will have gone almost<br />\nfor naught.<br />\nIn other words, most of the<br />\ntimings for the realization of which<br />\nthe founders of this country<br />\nstruggled and for which Americans have stood during our century or more of independent political existence are at issue in<br />\nthis war. The national state with<br />\nits incidents, internationalism,<br />\nself-government and democracy,<br />\nall are imperiled. The war is thus<br />\nan American war, even if no single battle is fought on our own<br />\nsoil.<br />\nIf, which God forbid,<br />\nthrough time victory of the Central<br />\nPowers over our European allies,<br />\nthe conflict were brought to our<br />\nshores, our efforts would in all<br />\nprobability be but the desperate<br />\nstruggle of the victim whose fate<br />\nwas due to the fact that, beguiled<br />\nby the fair speech of the oppressor, he began too late to fight.<br />\n<br />\nBASKET-BALL PROSPECT BRIGHT<br />\nOrganization Meeting Held\u2014 This Year's<br />\nMaterial Looks to Be Good\u2014Team<br />\nto Compete for Pfitsch<br />\nCup.<br />\n<br />\nA meeting of those interested<br />\nin basket-ball was held on Wednesday and it was decided to put<br />\nan independent team on the floor<br />\nagain this year.

Three battalions of Usaacs, the Eighth, Thirteenth and Fifteenth, came down<br />\nto Fort Myer from Allentown for<br />\nthe game between Ambulance and<br />\nGeorgetown on Thanksgiving Day,<br />\nand the Baltimore men got permission after the game to spend<br />\nthe week-end at home.<br />\nThe rest of the command, some<br />\nthousand strong, left Washington<br />\nSunday morning early and passed<br />\nthrough Baltimore about the middle of the day, when they were rejoined by the Hopkins awn. The<br />\nsixty ambulances, fifty trucks and<br />\nlive field kitchens, which comprised the command, made quite<br />\nan impressive showing as they<br />\npassed through the streets, and<br />\nlarge crowds turned out to see<br />\nthem.

Quite a number of good men<br />\nhave come out for the team and<br />\njust at present it appears that<br />\nthey will be able to hold their own<br />\nwith any other aggregation in this<br />\nsection of the country. \u2022<br />\nCharles McCormick has been<br />\neletced captain of the team and<br />\nManager Ginsberg has arranged<br />\nmany meets during the winter<br />\nmonths.

The modern German,<br />\nhowever, declares with a contemptuous frankness all non-Teutonic<br />\ncivilization to be ' unworthy of<br />\nperpetuation and announces his<br />\nintention to disperse its degenerate followers to those parts of the<br />\nearth where they will least interfere with the spread of Deutsche<br />\nKultur.

The Germans of the present day despise<br />\nour capacity, envy our prosperity,<br />\nand are not inclined to comply<br />\nwith our desire to pursue the even<br />\ntenor of our ways in the continents which we have colonized and<br />\ndeveloped.<br />\nWe have further in German pretensions a direct attack upon the<br />\nkind of life which we have chosen<br />\nto live. Two characteristics have<br />\ndistinguished the modern European life in which we have a<br />\nshare. The first is internationalism, the second is democracy.<br />\nInternationalism is the solution<br />\nwhich we have been endeavoring,<br />\nand successfully endeavoring, to<br />\nreach, of the problems incident<br />\nto the national state. The most<br />\nnoticeable phenomenon of mddern<br />\nEuropean political life has been<br />\nthe development of the national<br />\nstate. While the ideal of the national state has been only approximated, while all races have not<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, DECEMBER 10, 1917.<br />\nbeen politically organized, and<br />\nwhile some races have found a<br />\nhome in more than one state, at<br />\nthe same time the co existence of<br />\na number of politically sovereign<br />\norganizations has of itself been a<br />\ndenial of the idea of world domination.<br />\nInternationalism is the method<br />\nwhich has been adopted for regulating the relations of these separate political organizations. Rules<br />\nof conduct have been generally<br />\nadopted to which all members of<br />\nthe family of nations have in the<br />\npast rendered obedience. . The<br />\nideal of internationalism\u2022 has, of<br />\ncourse, not been contpletely realized, but enough progress had been<br />\nmade prior to the outbreak of<br />\nthe present war to justify the belief that reasonable approximation to that ideal would ultimately be reached. No country perhaps in the past century has contributed more to the realization<br />\nof the ideals of internationalism<br />\nthan the United States. This<br />\ncountry has always stood for<br />\nthose principles the application of<br />\nwhich would, on the one hand, lessen the probability of the development of hostile relations between<br />\nstates, and, on the other, would<br />\noffer a means for the peaceful<br />\nsettlement of such disputes as<br />\nmight arrive. America's past history thus causes her to have a<br />\npeculiar interest in the further development of the principles of internationalism.<br />\nThe maintenance even of time<br />\naccepted principles of internationalism is, however, inconsistent<br />\nwith the conception of world control which is at present the mainspring of German policy. The policy cannot recognize any such<br />\nthing as equality among political<br />\ngroups. All must be subordinated<br />\nto the one great power. If, therefore, we are to hope for the further development of an international life we must fight to the<br />\ndeath German pretensions.<br />\nThe second characteristic of<br />\nmodern European life has been the<br />\ndevelopment of democracy. Democratic ideas originated in England. They were brought to this<br />\ncountry when it was colonized and<br />\nreceived a development which was<br />\nhardly dreamed of in the land of<br />\ntheir birth. Thence they spread<br />\nto France and through France to<br />\nmost of Western Europe. The<br />\nseeds of democratic ideas fell,<br />\nhowever, in Germany among the<br />\nthorns of autocratic government<br />\nand the thorns sprung up and<br />\nchoked them. Just as the French<br />\nRevolution and the Napoleonic<br />\nwars brought democracy to most<br />\nof Western Europe, so the present<br />\nwar has given it to Russia, where<br />\nautocracy in its extreme form had<br />\nbeen able to maintain itself.<br />\nWe have, therefore, allied<br />\nagainst German autocracy practically all of Western Europe, together with Japan, Russia and the<br />\nUnited States. If the autocratic<br />\ngovernments of the Central Powers are successful in this war, de-<br /><br />\nmocracy will be judged a failure<br />\nand the struggle and agony of<br />\ncenturies will have gone almost<br />\nfor naught.<br />\nIn other words, most of the<br />\ntimings for the realization of which<br />\nthe founders of this country<br />\nstruggled and for which Americans have stood during our century or more of independent political existence are at issue in<br />\nthis war. The national state with<br />\nits incidents, internationalism,<br />\nself-government and democracy,<br />\nall are imperiled. The war is thus<br />\nan American war, even if no single battle is fought on our own<br />\nsoil.<br />\nIf, which God forbid,<br />\nthrough time victory of the Central<br />\nPowers over our European allies,<br />\nthe conflict were brought to our<br />\nshores, our efforts would in all<br />\nprobability be but the desperate<br />\nstruggle of the victim whose fate<br />\nwas due to the fact that, beguiled<br />\nby the fair speech of the oppressor, he began too late to fight.<br /><br />\nBASKET-BALL PROSPECT BRIGHT<br />\nOrganization Meeting Held\u2014 This Year's<br />\nMaterial Looks to Be Good\u2014Team<br />\nto Compete for Pfitsch<br />\nCup.<br /><br />\nA meeting of those interested<br />\nin basket-ball was held on Wednesday and it was decided to put<br />\nan independent team on the floor<br />\nagain this year.

The<br />\nsixty ambulances, fifty trucks and<br />\nlive field kitchens, which comprised the command, made quite<br />\nan impressive showing as they<br />\npassed through the streets, and<br />\nlarge crowds turned out to see<br />\nthem.

Quite a number of good men<br />\nhave come out for the team and<br />\njust at present it appears that<br />\nthey will be able to hold their own<br />\nwith any other aggregation in this<br />\nsection of the country. \u2022<br />\nCharles McCormick has been<br />\neletced captain of the team and<br />\nManager Ginsberg has arranged<br />\nmany meets during the winter<br />\nmonths.
