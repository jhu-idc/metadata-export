According to the terms of the offer, all three games<br />\n1104<br />\nare to be played before the middle of April, which is two months off,<br />\nand that time is steadily growing less. Both classes have elected<br />\ntheir captains\u2014for 1908, Frank Breyer; for 1909, George Chandlee.<br />\nV<br />\n4f<br />\n:<br />\n4<br />\nmanager of the Freshman team is Brooke Bird. As yet, beyond<br />\nThe<br />\n4L<br />\nholding<br />\nthe elections, neither class has done anything, and there has<br />\n111<br />\nVVIOVVVVV1.41110<br />\nlittle interest displayed.

It will be remembered how the class lacrosse teams<br />\nworked last year. Both teams practised hard, and often those practices were at inconvenient<br />\ntimes, but the fellows got there all the same.<br />\nThe Freshman class is not taking up this matter in the proper spirit. Some of them<br />\nseem to take it for granted that the Juniors have already won the games. Because 1908 won<br />\nlast year is no reason to suppose that they are going to do so again. Every Freshman should<br />\nfeel that it is just as much an honor to make the class lacrosse team as any other. Freshman!<br />\nMake your class team this year! Show that you are good enough to do that, and you will<br />\nstand a better show for the 'Varsity next year. The object of this offer is to get new blood<br />\nout for the 'Varsity. The alumni have shown us that they will do their part by us. Now it<br />\nis up to us, Juniors and Freshmen alike, to show our appreciation of this offer, and to do our<br />\npart by the alumni and by the 'Varsity team of days to come.<br />\nh<br />\n<br />\nHE musical clubs at Hopkins, were a few years ago a flourishing institution. They are not now. The general impression seems to be<br />\ng<br />\nthat they are not worth while and that there is not enough material<br />\nnow in the University. To take up the first as if it needed proof,<br />\nthe musical clubs are worth while. Any of the '03 or '05 men who<br />\nwere on the clubs will tell you that many of the finest \"times\" they<br />\nhad were in touring the country. Houses were thrown open to them<br />\nin true southern hospitality. Dances, receptions, dinners and pretty<br />\ngirls. The name of Hopkins man was an open sesame to all. For<br />\nthe clubs in those days, so say those of the ancient regime, were the<br />\nbest in the country, and at a concert given jointly with Princeton all the press notices sent out<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nfrom Old Point Comfort remarked the Hopkins superiority. Those were the days of Edgeworth Smith the founder of the NEWS-LETTER. At no time is there such a chance for the<br />\npure joy of living as on the trips. And the queer part of it, to go on to the question of material, is that the men were not musical geniuses, but they merely went regularly to practice.<br />\nNow what we would say is, the musical clubs are freshly started with a new leader,<br />\npractices regularly attended\u2014there is going to be no more lack of interest, everything is going<br />\nalong for the Easter trip. \"So get in the game.\" There is yet time. What seemed impossible in the case of the Baseball team has turned out flourishing and the musical clubs are not<br />\nin that woe-be-gone state. Go in for them and help them you will be repaid by more pleasure.<br />\n<br />\nAt a meeting of the Trustees of the Johns Hopkins University held February 8, 1907,<br />\nthe following letter was presented from Mr. Theodore Marburg.<br />\n<br />\nPRESIDENT IRA REMSEN,<br />\n<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD.<br />\nDear Sir:\u2014It is my privilege in behalf of three of the heirs of Mr. Charles L.

Marburg and Theodore Marburg, to<br />\noffer to the Johns Hopkins University the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) as a memorial to their brother, Mr. Charles L. Marburg.<br />\nThe condition of the gift is that it shall be used either,<br />\n1. To establish a professorship to bear the name of Charles L. Marburg, or,<br />\n2. To establish an endowment fund to bear the name of Charles L. Marburg, the principal of which fund shall remain intact, provided that the Trustees shall have the right to<br />\napply the fund now or at a future time toward the erection at Homewood of a building to bear<br />\nthe name of Charles L. Marburg.<br />\nThe heirs are aware of the custom of the Board of the Johns Hopkins University to<br />\nname professorships after the donors of not less that one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)<br />\nbut in view of the past contributions of Mr. Charles L.

The change<br />\nwill do you good, and incidentally we may<br />\nhave a little detective work which promises to<br />\nbe interesting. If you can possibly come on<br />\nthe next train, do so.\"<br />\nHenry Hutton and I had been close friends<br />\nat college, but the intimacy which had sprung<br />\nup between us had not been continued in after<br />\nlife. Our ways seemed invariably to lead<br />\napart, and though I had sometimes heard of<br />\nmy former friend, the possibility of seeing<br />\nhim again appeared very slight. I was therefore greatly surprised to receive a letter, at<br />\nonce so cordial and so vague. Why he should<br />\nsingle me out from the rest of his friends, I<br />\ncould not well imagine. A year or so ago, I<br />\nhad heard that he had rented a country place<br />\nin the eastern part of New York, and as far<br />\nas I was aware lie was still in possession of it.<br />\nThat he was eccentric I knew for a certainty;<br />\nbut whether this trait of character, which<br />\nrather attracted than repelled me, had increased<br />\nin the ten years since we had left college, I<br />\ndid not know. These matters, however, were<br />\nof minor importance, and could be satisfactorily answered when I met him. He had<br />\nmentioned the first train, and it was by the<br />\nvery first train that I left.<br />\nAs it was almost dark when I arrived at my<br />\ndestination, I was greatly relieved to find a<br />\nhorse and carriage awaiting me at the station.<br />\nThe lane over which we travelled was narrow,<br />\nthe trees forming a sort of archway overhead;<br />\nbut the horse appeared to know the way and<br />\ntrotted along at a fairly good speed, considering the uneveness of the country. At last,<br />\nafter driving for half an hour, we turned<br />\nsharply toward the left, and there directly in<br />\nfront of us lay a small frame dwelling before<br />\nwhose uncertain steps the horse slowed up<br />\nand stopped.<br />\nMy host rushed out eagerly to meet me,<br />\nand I was soon made to feel that the friendship which had existed between us so many<br />\nyears before had not suffered from separation.<br />\nWe talked over our many college adventures,<br />\nrecalled with pride the part which we had<br />\ntaken in several athletic contests, and laughed<br />\ntogether over the wide discrepancies between<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nwhat we had planned to do, and what we<br />\nreally had done.<br />\n\"Perhaps,\" said my friend, changing the<br />\nsubject, \"you would like to know the special<br />\nreason why I asked you to come here ?\"<br />\nI nodded assent, and he continued :<br />\n\"It's a rather long story whieh I have to<br />\ntell, but I will try to make it as brief as possible. Many years ago,\" lie began, \"in fact<br />\nin the early half of the seventeen hundreds, a<br />\nfamily of Boltons left England and settled in<br />\nthe neighborhood of Salem, Massachusetts.<br />\nHowever, finding the climate or the people<br />\nnot to their liking, they emigrated west and<br />\nbought a large stretch of land several miles<br />\nfrom here. As far as can be ascertained, they<br />\nwere wealthy, and the outbreak of the war<br />\nfor independence found them in possession of<br />\none of the largest tracts of land in the eastern<br />\npart of America. By this time, there were<br />\nseveral branches of the Bolton family, and<br />\neach branch valiantly assisted in that great<br />\nwar for liberty.<br />\n\"At the time of the British invasion from<br />\nCanada, the aspect of the war was not at all<br />\nfavorable to the colonials, and for a while it<br />\nalmost seemed that the attack would prove<br />\nsuccessful. The advance of the British army<br />\nthrough New York Tay directly over the lands<br />\nowned by the Boltons; yet unmindful of<br />\nadvice, the Boltons did not temporarily abandon their estates, but awaited the coming of<br />\nthe Union Jack with seeming equanimity.<br />\nHow extremely unwise this course proved to<br />\nbe may be seen when I tell you that only one,<br />\nor possibly two, Boltons survived that advance. The Indians, who were allied to the<br />\nBritish, forcing their way ahead of the main<br />\ncolumn, wreaked dire vengeance on all who<br />\nlay in their path. The only member of the<br />\nBolton family that escaped was a girl, who at<br />\nthe tune of the massacre of her kinsfolk was<br />\nstaying with friends in Boston. The reason<br />\nfor my saying that only one or two survived<br />\nis that a certain Elsinore Bolton managed to<br />\nescape, though frightfully wounded; but from<br />\nthe fact that, as far as I can ascertain, he was<br />\nnever heard of again, there is but little doubt<br />\nthat he perished. The Bolton girl, strange as<br />\nit may seem, went to England and married<br />\nthere. After the war had been brought to a<br />\nsuccessful close, the Bolton estate was seized<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nby the Confederation, no one at that time<br />\nbeing aware that there were any living heirs,<br />\nand afterwards passed into the hands of the<br />\nUnited States which sold the greater part<br />\nof it.<br />\n\"Now the reason that all this is of the utmost interest to me is that about two years<br />\nago, while I was running over some genealogical tables, I discovered that I was the<br />\ndirect descendant of the Miss Bolton who had<br />\ngone to England, and, as it happened, the<br />\nonly one. The other facts which I have told<br />\nyou were gathered after diligent search. I<br />\nsaw that I had a clear case against the government, yet I knew that it would be hopelessly<br />\nimpossible to prove it, unless I was able to<br />\nproduce the original deeds for the land. If I<br />\nsucceeded in doing this, untold wealth would<br />\nawait me,for the land itself now embraces six<br />\nof the richest counties in New York. You<br />\nremember how I have always longed for riches,<br />\nso when this brilliant dream came so directly<br />\nbefore my eyes I swore that nothing should<br />\ncome between me and this wealth. I tell you<br />\nduring the last year I have had no other<br />\nthought than of this. But everything hung<br />\nupon the existence of the deeds. If I obtained<br />\npossession of them, I could count my money<br />\nhy millions.<br />\n\"I considered many plans, but the one I at<br />\nlast decided upon was this. I would rent a<br />\nhouse near the old Bolton mansion (which is<br />\nnow wholly in ruins) and see if I could discover there anything of importance. Though<br />\nI have lived here over a year, yet it was not<br />\nuntil lately that fortune smiled upon my efforts. A few days ago, about a hundred yards<br />\nfrom the ruins of the old house, I found the<br />\nremains of a little cave which had probably<br />\nbeen used for the keeping of milk and butter.<br />\nAs it had been almost wholly concealed from<br />\nmy view by a fallen tree, it was the merest<br />\nchance which led me to it. A part of the<br />\nroof had fallen in, and to my great joy, upon<br />\nmaking a hasty inspection, I discovered a<br />\nclumsy iron box which had probably been<br />\nconcealed behind that part of the arch which<br />\nhad fallen. I took it home and opened it.<br />\nInside was this paper.\"<br />\nMy host had risen while he was saying this<br />\nand now took from a cupboard the very box<br />\nof which he spoke. The paper which he<br />\n<br />\nhanded me was yellow with age, yet the characters were plainly legible. I felt that my<br />\nfriend's eyes were following me intently as I<br />\nscanned the odd bit of writing.<br />\n\"Rseivl, sddee Hetlneev dinsal konmat<br />\nnseev sstpe tsenan elgar eter.\"<br />\nFor a moment I paused, searching my<br />\nmemory. Then the solution suddenly flashed<br />\nacross my mind.<br />\n\"Nothing can be simpler than the meaning,\" said I, again closely scanning the paper.<br />\n\"The deeds, and incidentally the family silver,<br />\ncan be found if we go to the eleventh island<br />\nof Lake Oratunk, and begin digging seven<br />\nsteps west of the big tree.\"<br />\n\"Rather a good guess,\" partly concealing<br />\nhis astonishment. \"How do you make that<br />\nout ?\"<br />\n\"No guess at all,\" I rejoined, \"for I have<br />\nseen many of similar nature. This especial<br />\none is simplicity itself. Use the second,<br />\nfourth, sixth, etc.. letters in each word and<br />\nadd the remaining letters backwards. For<br />\ninstance, by this method, grseivl' resolves itself into 'silver,' and the other words may be<br />\ntranslated in the same way.\"<br />\n!`Quite clever,\" remarked my triend, \"but<br />\nI hope your cleverness will not go to extremes.<br />\nYou see,\" my host continued as I handed<br />\nback the paper, \"I asked you here solely that<br />\nyou might be a witness to the genuineness of<br />\nthe deeds. I had worked out the lettering<br />\nbefore you came. I did not think that you<br />\nwould object to your position, and then I was<br />\nsure that I could trust you not to care about<br />\nmaking a fortune at my expense. You see<br />\nI have staked a great part of my life on the<br />\npossibility of becoming wealthy, and no one<br />\nshall deter me. If any one tries,\" he said,<br />\nand for the first time I could discern a horrid<br />\nfierceness in his eyes, \"if any one stands in<br />\nmy way, out he shall go.\"<br />\n\"There is no use worrying over that now,\"<br />\nI said, laughing, \"and it's high time that<br />\nboth of us should have some sleep. Tomorrow<br />\nwe shall explore Lake Oratunk, and see what<br />\nmay be found on island number eleven; but<br />\nuntil then, let's say good-night.\"<br />\n\"Perhaps that would be best,\" admitted<br />\nmy host, putting the iron box back in the<br />\ncup-board and securely locking the latter.<br />\n\"Then I'll see you at eight.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f7<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n\"Certainly,\" I said, climbing the narrow<br />\nstaircase, \"we'll both feel like new men in<br />\nthe morning.\"<br />\nI did not, however, go immediately to bed.<br />\n'Peculiar coincidence,\" thought I, \"and probably only a coincidence, nevertheless I shall<br />\nwrite and see what may come of it.\" And<br />\nhaving carried out my intention, I turned in<br />\nand slept till the servant awae me next<br />\nmorning by rapping on the door.<br />\nAfter breakfast Hutton and I walked down<br />\nto Lake Oratunk, placed a pick and shovel in<br />\nthe bottom of the boat which was moored<br />\nthere, and pushed off. Of the many lakes<br />\nwhich I have seen in my various wanderings,<br />\nI think Lake Oratunk is, for its size, the<br />\nprettiest of all. Perhaps the lake is five miles<br />\nbug, but not so many wide, and from every<br />\nside of it rise low foot-hills, thickly wooded<br />\nwith a magnificent virgin forest. The water<br />\nis remarkably clear and still, and here and<br />\nthere far out from shore we could discern<br />\nsmall green islands which dotted the lake with<br />\nalmost unnatural regularity. Our boat was<br />\nturned toward the head of the lake, for we had<br />\ndecided to pass the islands one by one, until<br />\nwe arrived at the eleventh.<br />\nIsland number one, as I jokingly called it,<br />\nwas small and densely wooded, and so in fact<br />\nwere most of the other islands. When at last<br />\nwe rested on our oars, letting the boat glide<br />\ntoward \"number eleven,\" we were somewhat<br />\ndisappointed to see that it was very similar to<br />\nseveral of the islands which we had passed.<br />\nTouching shore at what appeared to be the<br />\nmost favorable point, we landed, and sought<br />\nout the most formidable looking tree. It was<br />\nall surprisingly simple. My friend stepped<br />\nseven paces toward the west, marked the end<br />\nof the seventh step and began digging. But<br />\nhe did not swing his pick for long. At the<br />\nsecond or third stroke there was a sharp click,<br />\nand upan seeking its cause we found that<br />\nsolid rock had been reached. This outcome<br />\nwas most unexpected. My host tried again,<br />\nseveral feet away, but with the same result.<br />\nThen we walked around to the other side of<br />\nthe island, dug for a moment or so, and again<br />\nstruck rock. My friend's countenance, which<br />\nall the morning had worn a hopeful smile,<br />\ngrew utterly white.<br />\n\"We are mistaken,\" he said, and his voice<br />\n<br />\nscarcely rose above a whisper. \"This is the<br />\nwrong island. Nothing could possibly be<br />\nconcealed here, as the soil is not half a foot<br />\ndeep. But I tell you I shall not be baffled.\"<br />\nHere his tone grew exceedingly harsh.<br />\n\"Practically<br />\n[THE NEws-LETTER appreciating the keen interest<br />\nof the under-classmen which has shown itself in the<br />\nnumerous contributions which they offer almost in<br />\noverwhelming numbers, has decided to give them a<br />\nchance to finish the story.

They are, in all probability, at the bottom of Lake Oratunk.<br />\n<br />\nTHE DRAMA.<br />\nLast spring the Nuws-IATTER warmly advocated the starting of a Dramatic Club. Although at that time there was some discussion,<br />\nand a few hazy plans were formed, nothing<br />\ndefinite was done. If we only stopped to consider what we could do in this line it is probable that much more would be accomplished.<br />\nNow although the organization, under<br />\nwhose auspices entertainments of a theatrical<br />\nnature would be given, would have to be the<br />\nDramatic Club, this does not mean that we<br />\nwould have to begin by giving Shakespere,<br />\ngreek drama, or to come down to modern<br />\ntimes, even musical comedy. These things<br />\nrequire solid financial backing, great enthusiasm, and a certain amount of already devolped talent.<br />\nNow let us for the moment lay aside the<br />\nidea of stageing the chefs d'oevre of the bard<br />\nof Avon or of famous greeks, for these belong<br />\nto that highest realm of thespian art, which is<br />\nonly reached after many years of failure and<br />\nperseverance.<br />\nBut let us look over the talent in the University. What have we to start a Dramatic<br />\nClub with? The first thing which naturally<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LErrER.<br />\n<br />\noccurs to one, is the Musical Clubs. Here we<br />\nhave voices in the Glee Club and sweet music<br />\nin the Mandolin Club. The wit would be<br />\nsupplied from the two upper classes with<br />\nslight assistance from freshmen, and lo! we<br />\nhave all the ingredients for a first class<br />\nminstrel show. Rumor has it that there lives<br />\na freshman who, with his deep bass voice and<br />\nnegro dialect would make a capital end man.<br />\nAnd have we not with us one, Raleigh, a perfect specimen of the barber shop tenor? Is he<br />\nnot a \"big noise?\" Yes he is (not!) And<br />\nlook who's here! where, oh where is the famous \"grand opera\" which has made laughs<br />\nby the bushel for the whole of college since<br />\ntime was. Yes we might even run in \"Buck,\"<br />\nthe man from Missouri.<br />\nAt any rate we know that we have the<br />\ntalent; and the NEWS-LP;TTER will furnish<br />\nimpassioned articles to arouse enthusiasm.<br />\nThe subject of backing hardly enters into a<br />\nCollege Minstrel show, it could almost all be<br />\ngotten in the same way as such things are<br />\ndone on the Musical Clubs. So let us gird<br />\nup our loins, (such of us as have any,) and<br />\nholding ever before our eyes those sterling<br />\nwords \"all is not gold that ends well\" let us<br />\nproceed to get up one of the best shows ever<br />\nseen in Baltimore.<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\nDid anyone happen to notice the rushing<br />\nbusiness Walter did in the barber shop the<br />\nday of the dance? One could always find one<br />\nor two worshippers at the altar of Terpsichore,<br />\nwaiting his turn to have his hair cut or beard<br />\nshaved. If there are many more such days,<br />\nWalter Fernandis & Co., Ltd., will be declaring dividends on their preferred stock, and<br />\nsome new improvements may be made. It's<br />\na long cry to April fifth, however, and we can<br />\nnot expect many bull markets before that<br />\ntime.<br />\n<br />\nWhere was the Freshman class on Hopkins<br />\nnight? That was the time the Juniors got the<br />\ndrop on you. Attended by two band-organs<br />\nand several lemons, the Juniors, that is those<br />\nwho were not suping, or fussing, occupied a<br />\nportion of the balcony, and succeeded in con-<br />\n<br />\ntributing materially to the enjoyment of the<br />\noccasion. The yelling was very good, and<br />\nthe close harmony was intelligible, although<br />\nthe orchestra and the singers were not always<br />\nin accord. Unfortunately the Freshmen did<br />\nnot have any regular representation present.<br />\nThis may have been due to the fact that since<br />\ntheir little theatre party, after the football<br />\ngame, was broken up by the Juniors, they<br />\nwere unwilling to risk another such venture.<br />\nMr. Richard McSherry has been elected captain of the 'Varsity football team for the season of 1907.

Even<br />\nthe Seniors had no chance to speak of it the<br />\nnext day, the 13th of February, for on the<br />\n13th the Juniors had their banquet and the<br />\nFreshmen attempted to break it up. Although<br />\nthey got a flying start the day before, the<br />\ndetails of which are too well-known to need<br />\nattention and can be found in the public<br />\nprints of the town, the Freshmen really accomplished nothing beyond losing much sleep,<br />\ngetting bloody and dirty, and having five of<br />\ntheir heroes absent at their banquet. It was<br />\nthe most overwhelming defeat any Freshmen<br />\n<br />\nclass ever had. Inadvertently the Freshmen<br />\nwere the cause of the late appearance of the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER and their unavailing efforts<br />\nwill merely be used in a \"Prisoner of Zenda\"<br />\nstory in some future issue. While the NEWSLETTER has this year twice advocated a curbing of infantile exuberance, we would, nevertheless, remark that provided one has the time<br />\nto make up sleep and that sort of thing, the<br />\nbanquets make a certain bond of fellowship in<br />\nthe college, which perhaps equals the undoubted amount of harm which they do.

According to the terms of the offer, all three games<br />\n1104<br />\nare to be played before the middle of April, which is two months off,<br />\nand that time is steadily growing less. Both classes have elected<br />\ntheir captains\u2014for 1908, Frank Breyer; for 1909, George Chandlee.<br />\nV<br />\n4f<br />\n:<br />\n4<br />\nmanager of the Freshman team is Brooke Bird. As yet, beyond<br />\nThe<br />\n4L<br />\nholding<br />\nthe elections, neither class has done anything, and there has<br />\n111<br />\nVVIOVVVVV1.41110<br />\nlittle interest displayed. This spirit is to be deplored, and<br />\nvery<br />\nbeen<br />\nVVVRIP,<br />\nVW1r1PRVI<br />\nteams<br />\nboth<br />\nshould start to work soon in the fixed determination to<br />\nV Vi<br />\nwin those cups. It will be remembered how the class lacrosse teams<br />\nworked last year. Both teams practised hard, and often those practices were at inconvenient<br />\ntimes, but the fellows got there all the same.<br />\nThe Freshman class is not taking up this matter in the proper spirit. Some of them<br />\nseem to take it for granted that the Juniors have already won the games. Because 1908 won<br />\nlast year is no reason to suppose that they are going to do so again. Every Freshman should<br />\nfeel that it is just as much an honor to make the class lacrosse team as any other. Freshman!<br />\nMake your class team this year! Show that you are good enough to do that, and you will<br />\nstand a better show for the 'Varsity next year. The object of this offer is to get new blood<br />\nout for the 'Varsity. The alumni have shown us that they will do their part by us. Now it<br />\nis up to us, Juniors and Freshmen alike, to show our appreciation of this offer, and to do our<br />\npart by the alumni and by the 'Varsity team of days to come.<br />\nh<br /><br />\nHE musical clubs at Hopkins, were a few years ago a flourishing institution. They are not now. The general impression seems to be<br />\ng<br />\nthat they are not worth while and that there is not enough material<br />\nnow in the University. To take up the first as if it needed proof,<br />\nthe musical clubs are worth while. Any of the '03 or '05 men who<br />\nwere on the clubs will tell you that many of the finest \"times\" they<br />\nhad were in touring the country. Houses were thrown open to them<br />\nin true southern hospitality. Dances, receptions, dinners and pretty<br />\ngirls. The name of Hopkins man was an open sesame to all. For<br />\nthe clubs in those days, so say those of the ancient regime, were the<br />\nbest in the country, and at a concert given jointly with Princeton all the press notices sent out<br />\n,<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nfrom Old Point Comfort remarked the Hopkins superiority. Those were the days of Edgeworth Smith the founder of the NEWS-LETTER. At no time is there such a chance for the<br />\npure joy of living as on the trips. And the queer part of it, to go on to the question of material, is that the men were not musical geniuses, but they merely went regularly to practice.<br />\nNow what we would say is, the musical clubs are freshly started with a new leader,<br />\npractices regularly attended\u2014there is going to be no more lack of interest, everything is going<br />\nalong for the Easter trip. \"So get in the game.\" There is yet time. What seemed impossible in the case of the Baseball team has turned out flourishing and the musical clubs are not<br />\nin that woe-be-gone state. Go in for them and help them you will be repaid by more pleasure.<br /><br />\nAt a meeting of the Trustees of the Johns Hopkins University held February 8, 1907,<br />\nthe following letter was presented from Mr. Theodore Marburg.<br /><br />\nPRESIDENT IRA REMSEN,<br /><br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD.<br />\nDear Sir:\u2014It is my privilege in behalf of three of the heirs of Mr. Charles L. Marburg,<br />\nnamely, Miss Amelia Marburg and Messrs. William A. Marburg and Theodore Marburg, to<br />\noffer to the Johns Hopkins University the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) as a memorial to their brother, Mr. Charles L. Marburg.<br />\nThe condition of the gift is that it shall be used either,<br />\n1. To establish a professorship to bear the name of Charles L. Marburg, or,<br />\n2. To establish an endowment fund to bear the name of Charles L. Marburg, the principal of which fund shall remain intact, provided that the Trustees shall have the right to<br />\napply the fund now or at a future time toward the erection at Homewood of a building to bear<br />\nthe name of Charles L. Marburg.<br />\nThe heirs are aware of the custom of the Board of the Johns Hopkins University to<br />\nname professorships after the donors of not less that one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)<br />\nbut in view of the past contributions of Mr. Charles L. Marburg and his brothers to the University, which contributions, together with the present gift, amount to more than the sum<br />\nnamed, they feel that the above conditions of the gift are not unreasonable.<br />\nRespectfully,<br />\n(Signed) THEODORE MARBURG.<br />\nResolved, That the Trustees of the Johns Hopkins University gratefully accept the gift<br />\nof $50,000 offered to the University by Miss Amelia Marburg and Messrs. William A. Marburg and Theodore Marburg, heirs of the late Charles L.

The change<br />\nwill do you good, and incidentally we may<br />\nhave a little detective work which promises to<br />\nbe interesting. If you can possibly come on<br />\nthe next train, do so.\"<br />\nHenry Hutton and I had been close friends<br />\nat college, but the intimacy which had sprung<br />\nup between us had not been continued in after<br />\nlife. Our ways seemed invariably to lead<br />\napart, and though I had sometimes heard of<br />\nmy former friend, the possibility of seeing<br />\nhim again appeared very slight. I was therefore greatly surprised to receive a letter, at<br />\nonce so cordial and so vague. Why he should<br />\nsingle me out from the rest of his friends, I<br />\ncould not well imagine. A year or so ago, I<br />\nhad heard that he had rented a country place<br />\nin the eastern part of New York, and as far<br />\nas I was aware lie was still in possession of it.<br />\nThat he was eccentric I knew for a certainty;<br />\nbut whether this trait of character, which<br />\nrather attracted than repelled me, had increased<br />\nin the ten years since we had left college, I<br />\ndid not know. These matters, however, were<br />\nof minor importance, and could be satisfactorily answered when I met him. He had<br />\nmentioned the first train, and it was by the<br />\nvery first train that I left.<br />\nAs it was almost dark when I arrived at my<br />\ndestination, I was greatly relieved to find a<br />\nhorse and carriage awaiting me at the station.<br />\nThe lane over which we travelled was narrow,<br />\nthe trees forming a sort of archway overhead;<br />\nbut the horse appeared to know the way and<br />\ntrotted along at a fairly good speed, considering the uneveness of the country. At last,<br />\nafter driving for half an hour, we turned<br />\nsharply toward the left, and there directly in<br />\nfront of us lay a small frame dwelling before<br />\nwhose uncertain steps the horse slowed up<br />\nand stopped.<br />\nMy host rushed out eagerly to meet me,<br />\nand I was soon made to feel that the friendship which had existed between us so many<br />\nyears before had not suffered from separation.<br />\nWe talked over our many college adventures,<br />\nrecalled with pride the part which we had<br />\ntaken in several athletic contests, and laughed<br />\ntogether over the wide discrepancies between<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nwhat we had planned to do, and what we<br />\nreally had done.<br />\n\"Perhaps,\" said my friend, changing the<br />\nsubject, \"you would like to know the special<br />\nreason why I asked you to come here ?\"<br />\nI nodded assent, and he continued :<br />\n\"It's a rather long story whieh I have to<br />\ntell, but I will try to make it as brief as possible. Many years ago,\" lie began, \"in fact<br />\nin the early half of the seventeen hundreds, a<br />\nfamily of Boltons left England and settled in<br />\nthe neighborhood of Salem, Massachusetts.<br />\nHowever, finding the climate or the people<br />\nnot to their liking, they emigrated west and<br />\nbought a large stretch of land several miles<br />\nfrom here. As far as can be ascertained, they<br />\nwere wealthy, and the outbreak of the war<br />\nfor independence found them in possession of<br />\none of the largest tracts of land in the eastern<br />\npart of America. By this time, there were<br />\nseveral branches of the Bolton family, and<br />\neach branch valiantly assisted in that great<br />\nwar for liberty.<br />\n\"At the time of the British invasion from<br />\nCanada, the aspect of the war was not at all<br />\nfavorable to the colonials, and for a while it<br />\nalmost seemed that the attack would prove<br />\nsuccessful. The advance of the British army<br />\nthrough New York Tay directly over the lands<br />\nowned by the Boltons; yet unmindful of<br />\nadvice, the Boltons did not temporarily abandon their estates, but awaited the coming of<br />\nthe Union Jack with seeming equanimity.<br />\nHow extremely unwise this course proved to<br />\nbe may be seen when I tell you that only one,<br />\nor possibly two, Boltons survived that advance. The Indians, who were allied to the<br />\nBritish, forcing their way ahead of the main<br />\ncolumn, wreaked dire vengeance on all who<br />\nlay in their path. The only member of the<br />\nBolton family that escaped was a girl, who at<br />\nthe tune of the massacre of her kinsfolk was<br />\nstaying with friends in Boston. The reason<br />\nfor my saying that only one or two survived<br />\nis that a certain Elsinore Bolton managed to<br />\nescape, though frightfully wounded; but from<br />\nthe fact that, as far as I can ascertain, he was<br />\nnever heard of again, there is but little doubt<br />\nthat he perished. The Bolton girl, strange as<br />\nit may seem, went to England and married<br />\nthere. After the war had been brought to a<br />\nsuccessful close, the Bolton estate was seized<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nby the Confederation, no one at that time<br />\nbeing aware that there were any living heirs,<br />\nand afterwards passed into the hands of the<br />\nUnited States which sold the greater part<br />\nof it.<br />\n\"Now the reason that all this is of the utmost interest to me is that about two years<br />\nago, while I was running over some genealogical tables, I discovered that I was the<br />\ndirect descendant of the Miss Bolton who had<br />\ngone to England, and, as it happened, the<br />\nonly one. The other facts which I have told<br />\nyou were gathered after diligent search. I<br />\nsaw that I had a clear case against the government, yet I knew that it would be hopelessly<br />\nimpossible to prove it, unless I was able to<br />\nproduce the original deeds for the land. If I<br />\nsucceeded in doing this, untold wealth would<br />\nawait me,for the land itself now embraces six<br />\nof the richest counties in New York. You<br />\nremember how I have always longed for riches,<br />\nso when this brilliant dream came so directly<br />\nbefore my eyes I swore that nothing should<br />\ncome between me and this wealth. I tell you<br />\nduring the last year I have had no other<br />\nthought than of this. But everything hung<br />\nupon the existence of the deeds. If I obtained<br />\npossession of them, I could count my money<br />\nhy millions.<br />\n\"I considered many plans, but the one I at<br />\nlast decided upon was this. I would rent a<br />\nhouse near the old Bolton mansion (which is<br />\nnow wholly in ruins) and see if I could discover there anything of importance. Though<br />\nI have lived here over a year, yet it was not<br />\nuntil lately that fortune smiled upon my efforts. A few days ago, about a hundred yards<br />\nfrom the ruins of the old house, I found the<br />\nremains of a little cave which had probably<br />\nbeen used for the keeping of milk and butter.<br />\nAs it had been almost wholly concealed from<br />\nmy view by a fallen tree, it was the merest<br />\nchance which led me to it. A part of the<br />\nroof had fallen in, and to my great joy, upon<br />\nmaking a hasty inspection, I discovered a<br />\nclumsy iron box which had probably been<br />\nconcealed behind that part of the arch which<br />\nhad fallen. I took it home and opened it.<br />\nInside was this paper.\"<br />\nMy host had risen while he was saying this<br />\nand now took from a cupboard the very box<br />\nof which he spoke. The paper which he<br /><br />\nhanded me was yellow with age, yet the characters were plainly legible. I felt that my<br />\nfriend's eyes were following me intently as I<br />\nscanned the odd bit of writing.<br />\n\"Rseivl, sddee Hetlneev dinsal konmat<br />\nnseev sstpe tsenan elgar eter.\"<br />\nFor a moment I paused, searching my<br />\nmemory. Then the solution suddenly flashed<br />\nacross my mind.<br />\n\"Nothing can be simpler than the meaning,\" said I, again closely scanning the paper.<br />\n\"The deeds, and incidentally the family silver,<br />\ncan be found if we go to the eleventh island<br />\nof Lake Oratunk, and begin digging seven<br />\nsteps west of the big tree.\"<br />\n\"Rather a good guess,\" partly concealing<br />\nhis astonishment. \"How do you make that<br />\nout ?\"<br />\n\"No guess at all,\" I rejoined, \"for I have<br />\nseen many of similar nature. This especial<br />\none is simplicity itself. Use the second,<br />\nfourth, sixth, etc.. letters in each word and<br />\nadd the remaining letters backwards. For<br />\ninstance, by this method, grseivl' resolves itself into 'silver,' and the other words may be<br />\ntranslated in the same way.\"<br />\n!`Quite clever,\" remarked my triend, \"but<br />\nI hope your cleverness will not go to extremes.<br />\nYou see,\" my host continued as I handed<br />\nback the paper, \"I asked you here solely that<br />\nyou might be a witness to the genuineness of<br />\nthe deeds. I had worked out the lettering<br />\nbefore you came. I did not think that you<br />\nwould object to your position, and then I was<br />\nsure that I could trust you not to care about<br />\nmaking a fortune at my expense. You see<br />\nI have staked a great part of my life on the<br />\npossibility of becoming wealthy, and no one<br />\nshall deter me. If any one tries,\" he said,<br />\nand for the first time I could discern a horrid<br />\nfierceness in his eyes, \"if any one stands in<br />\nmy way, out he shall go.\"<br />\n\"There is no use worrying over that now,\"<br />\nI said, laughing, \"and it's high time that<br />\nboth of us should have some sleep. Tomorrow<br />\nwe shall explore Lake Oratunk, and see what<br />\nmay be found on island number eleven; but<br />\nuntil then, let's say good-night.\"<br />\n\"Perhaps that would be best,\" admitted<br />\nmy host, putting the iron box back in the<br />\ncup-board and securely locking the latter.<br />\n\"Then I'll see you at eight.\"<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n\"Certainly,\" I said, climbing the narrow<br />\nstaircase, \"we'll both feel like new men in<br />\nthe morning.\"<br />\nI did not, however, go immediately to bed.<br />\n'Peculiar coincidence,\" thought I, \"and probably only a coincidence, nevertheless I shall<br />\nwrite and see what may come of it.\" And<br />\nhaving carried out my intention, I turned in<br />\nand slept till the servant awae me next<br />\nmorning by rapping on the door.<br />\nAfter breakfast Hutton and I walked down<br />\nto Lake Oratunk, placed a pick and shovel in<br />\nthe bottom of the boat which was moored<br />\nthere, and pushed off. Of the many lakes<br />\nwhich I have seen in my various wanderings,<br />\nI think Lake Oratunk is, for its size, the<br />\nprettiest of all. Perhaps the lake is five miles<br />\nbug, but not so many wide, and from every<br />\nside of it rise low foot-hills, thickly wooded<br />\nwith a magnificent virgin forest. The water<br />\nis remarkably clear and still, and here and<br />\nthere far out from shore we could discern<br />\nsmall green islands which dotted the lake with<br />\nalmost unnatural regularity. Our boat was<br />\nturned toward the head of the lake, for we had<br />\ndecided to pass the islands one by one, until<br />\nwe arrived at the eleventh.<br />\nIsland number one, as I jokingly called it,<br />\nwas small and densely wooded, and so in fact<br />\nwere most of the other islands. When at last<br />\nwe rested on our oars, letting the boat glide<br />\ntoward \"number eleven,\" we were somewhat<br />\ndisappointed to see that it was very similar to<br />\nseveral of the islands which we had passed.<br />\nTouching shore at what appeared to be the<br />\nmost favorable point, we landed, and sought<br />\nout the most formidable looking tree. It was<br />\nall surprisingly simple. My friend stepped<br />\nseven paces toward the west, marked the end<br />\nof the seventh step and began digging. But<br />\nhe did not swing his pick for long. At the<br />\nsecond or third stroke there was a sharp click,<br />\nand upan seeking its cause we found that<br />\nsolid rock had been reached. This outcome<br />\nwas most unexpected. My host tried again,<br />\nseveral feet away, but with the same result.<br />\nThen we walked around to the other side of<br />\nthe island, dug for a moment or so, and again<br />\nstruck rock. My friend's countenance, which<br />\nall the morning had worn a hopeful smile,<br />\ngrew utterly white.<br />\n\"We are mistaken,\" he said, and his voice<br /><br />\nscarcely rose above a whisper. \"This is the<br />\nwrong island. Nothing could possibly be<br />\nconcealed here, as the soil is not half a foot<br />\ndeep. But I tell you I shall not be baffled.\"<br />\nHere his tone grew exceedingly harsh.<br />\n\"Practically<br />\n[THE NEws-LETTER appreciating the keen interest<br />\nof the under-classmen which has shown itself in the<br />\nnumerous contributions which they offer almost in<br />\noverwhelming numbers, has decided to give them a<br />\nchance to finish the story.

Although at that time there was some discussion,<br />\nand a few hazy plans were formed, nothing<br />\ndefinite was done. If we only stopped to consider what we could do in this line it is probable that much more would be accomplished.<br />\nNow although the organization, under<br />\nwhose auspices entertainments of a theatrical<br />\nnature would be given, would have to be the<br />\nDramatic Club, this does not mean that we<br />\nwould have to begin by giving Shakespere,<br />\ngreek drama, or to come down to modern<br />\ntimes, even musical comedy. These things<br />\nrequire solid financial backing, great enthusiasm, and a certain amount of already devolped talent.<br />\nNow let us for the moment lay aside the<br />\nidea of stageing the chefs d'oevre of the bard<br />\nof Avon or of famous greeks, for these belong<br />\nto that highest realm of thespian art, which is<br />\nonly reached after many years of failure and<br />\nperseverance.<br />\nBut let us look over the talent in the University. What have we to start a Dramatic<br />\nClub with? The first thing which naturally<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LErrER.<br /><br />\noccurs to one, is the Musical Clubs. Here we<br />\nhave voices in the Glee Club and sweet music<br />\nin the Mandolin Club. The wit would be<br />\nsupplied from the two upper classes with<br />\nslight assistance from freshmen, and lo! we<br />\nhave all the ingredients for a first class<br />\nminstrel show. Rumor has it that there lives<br />\na freshman who, with his deep bass voice and<br />\nnegro dialect would make a capital end man.<br />\nAnd have we not with us one, Raleigh, a perfect specimen of the barber shop tenor? Is he<br />\nnot a \"big noise?\" Yes he is (not!) And<br />\nlook who's here! where, oh where is the famous \"grand opera\" which has made laughs<br />\nby the bushel for the whole of college since<br />\ntime was. Yes we might even run in \"Buck,\"<br />\nthe man from Missouri.<br />\nAt any rate we know that we have the<br />\ntalent; and the NEWS-LP;TTER will furnish<br />\nimpassioned articles to arouse enthusiasm.<br />\nThe subject of backing hardly enters into a<br />\nCollege Minstrel show, it could almost all be<br />\ngotten in the same way as such things are<br />\ndone on the Musical Clubs. So let us gird<br />\nup our loins, (such of us as have any,) and<br />\nholding ever before our eyes those sterling<br />\nwords \"all is not gold that ends well\" let us<br />\nproceed to get up one of the best shows ever<br />\nseen in Baltimore.<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\nDid anyone happen to notice the rushing<br />\nbusiness Walter did in the barber shop the<br />\nday of the dance?

If there are many more such days,<br />\nWalter Fernandis &amp; Co., Ltd., will be declaring dividends on their preferred stock, and<br />\nsome new improvements may be made.

That was the time the Juniors got the<br />\ndrop on you. Attended by two band-organs<br />\nand several lemons, the Juniors, that is those<br />\nwho were not suping, or fussing, occupied a<br />\nportion of the balcony, and succeeded in con-<br /><br />\ntributing materially to the enjoyment of the<br />\noccasion. The yelling was very good, and<br />\nthe close harmony was intelligible, although<br />\nthe orchestra and the singers were not always<br />\nin accord. Unfortunately the Freshmen did<br />\nnot have any regular representation present.<br />\nThis may have been due to the fact that since<br />\ntheir little theatre party, after the football<br />\ngame, was broken up by the Juniors, they<br />\nwere unwilling to risk another such venture.<br />\nMr. Richard McSherry has been elected captain of the 'Varsity football team for the season of 1907.

With<br />\nHunter and Grays out of it, owing to sickness<br />\nand some accidents in the races, the fact that<br />\nJohns Hopkins University scored 11 points<br />\nspeaks well for the efforts of the other Men.<br />\nHad it not been for some ragged work on the<br />\npart of the judges in the 100-yard dash,<br />\nHopkins would have pulled second in the<br />\nmeet, but for some reason or other the judges<br /><br />\noverlooked the Hopkins representative, and<br />\nalthough a protest was lodged, it is not likely<br />\nthat much will come of it.<br />\nIn the half mile Mears of Hopkins toyed<br />\nwith his field and finished as he pleased fully<br />\ntwenty yards ahead of Herring, the second<br />\nman. Mears should lower the Hopkins record<br />\nin this event if he is consistent in his work<br />\nthis season. In the mile event Brenton<br />\nduplicated the performance of his team-mate<br />\nand won in a walk by forty yards. Breyer<br />\nran from scratch in this race and finished a<br />\nplucky third. Perce qualified for the finals<br />\nin the 100-yard dash but was overlooked in<br />\nsquabble for places, and Stewart had a fine<br />\nchance in the hurdles, but owing to an unlucky start was unplaced. Treadway was the<br />\nmost unfortunate of all the Hopkins men, as<br />\nhe seemed an easy winner in the quarter mile<br />\nuntil he was tripped by a limit man and his<br />\nwrist sprained.<br />\nThe next meet is to be held at the Armory<br />\non March 2nd. by the. Hopkins Athletic Association, and it is up to every candidate to<br />\ncome out and work to make this a success.<br />\nUp to the present Virginia has refused to<br />\nsend up a relay'team to try conclusions with<br />\nHopkins, and no team has been settled on to<br />\ntake their place.<br /><br />\nBASE BALL.<br />\nThe candidates for the base ball team were<br />\ncalled together for the first practice on February 9, and from the men and spirit shown in<br />\nthat first meeting all could see that Hopkins<br />\nwill have a creditable ball team next spring.<br />\nIt was decided not to elect a captain until a<br />\nlittle later in the season, when it will be<br />\nknown just what men are in a position to take<br />\nthe captaincy.<br />\nSeven of last year's team showed up, and<br />\nthus there will be a solid neulcus about which<br />\nto work in the new material. Webb, who<br />\nwho has come back to fill his old position<br />\nbehind the bat, should be able to steady<br />\nWatkins, who will probably have to pitch this<br />\nyear. This, however, is not altogether a new<br />\ncombination, for they formed the battery in<br />\nthe first part of the Lehigh game last spring.<br />\nOf the new men, the Medical School sent<br />\nout five. This is the largest delegation, and<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nas they are all men who know something<br />\nTHE TEMPTATIONS OF BALTIMORE<br />\nabout the game, it will be hard for the underSTUDENTS.<br />\ngraduates to get on the squad.

Even<br />\nthe Seniors had no chance to speak of it the<br />\nnext day, the 13th of February, for on the<br />\n13th the Juniors had their banquet and the<br />\nFreshmen attempted to break it up. Although<br />\nthey got a flying start the day before, the<br />\ndetails of which are too well-known to need<br />\nattention and can be found in the public<br />\nprints of the town, the Freshmen really accomplished nothing beyond losing much sleep,<br />\ngetting bloody and dirty, and having five of<br />\ntheir heroes absent at their banquet. It was<br />\nthe most overwhelming defeat any Freshmen<br /><br />\nclass ever had. Inadvertently the Freshmen<br />\nwere the cause of the late appearance of the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER and their unavailing efforts<br />\nwill merely be used in a \"Prisoner of Zenda\"<br />\nstory in some future issue. While the NEWSLETTER has this year twice advocated a curbing of infantile exuberance, we would, nevertheless, remark that provided one has the time<br />\nto make up sleep and that sort of thing, the<br />\nbanquets make a certain bond of fellowship in<br />\nthe college, which perhaps equals the undoubted amount of harm which they do. The<br />\nUniversity is certainly much more free from<br />\nthese puerile amusements than any other place<br />\nin the country and is to be congratulated.<br /><br />\nR. Q.
