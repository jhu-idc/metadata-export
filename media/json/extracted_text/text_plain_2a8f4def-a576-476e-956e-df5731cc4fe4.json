This word<br />\nof a ppeal seems, however, to have escaped<br />\nthe eyes of most of our readers. Certainly<br />\nthe wretched attendance at the concert last<br />\nweek justifies this belief, for we should not<br />\nthink that any one did see our remarks and<br />\ntook no heed.<br />\nAside from the fact that<br />\nit is the duty of every student to enhance<br />\nthe success of any concert given by the<br />\nMusical Clubs of the University, this one<br />\nin particular should have had the full support of the student body. The men do not<br />\nseem to realize that they themselves will<br />\nreap the advantages of the new athletic field.<br />\nIt is not being made for the use of any particular team or teams, but is to be for the<br />\ncommon benefit of all.<br />\nTherefore let us<br />\nhope that in the future, no student, paying<br />\nheed to these facts, will be backward in supporting any movement made for the general<br />\ngood.<br />\nN a late issue of \"The Intercollegiate,\"<br />\nwe see that Harvard has adopted a new<br />\nsystem, by which an honor man must<br />\nfollow a definite line of study, SO that he<br />\n/tiny not choose all the \"snap\" courses in the<br />\ncurriculum, in order to attain high marks.<br />\nThis is, of course, a good reform measure;<br />\nbut it is really only a following out, in the<br />\ncase of candidates for honors, of the Hopkins system of courses. It is another instance of one of the older colleges following<br />\nour lead. Harvard copied us before, in allowing a man his A. B. degree after three<br />\nyears of work.

Since we have not<br />\nheard who won, we presume that the betters<br />\nare still counting. Seriously, however, we<br />\nhope the advertising will prove successful,<br />\nand that a larger party 111;111 ever before will<br />\ngo to Northfield.<br />\nE desire to call the attention of some<br />\nW students to a few rather self-evident facts.

To be sure the lacrosse team got a<br />\npretty severe drubbing from Swarthmore.<br />\nWe are well aware, also, that the baseball<br />\nteam has played in hard luck all season.<br />\nYet we see no reason for discouragement,<br />\ncertainly not for blame, in the record of<br />\neither team.

The plan<br />\n'for season tickets was neither originated nor<br />\nwas it fostered by the Association.. It is no<br />\ncunning plan to collect more money from<br />\nstudents. On the other hand, it is a measure<br />\nput forward by the students themselves with<br />\na. view toward their own benefit. We believe<br />\nthat in the end the Association will also<br />\ngain, but in the beginning it obviously assumes considerable risk. The selling-price<br />\nfor tickets is calculated on the asKumption<br />\nthat the whole, or nearly the whole, of the<br />\nstudent-body will purchase; and should any<br />\nI arge pmportion of the students fail to do<br />\nso, the income of the teams might be seriously curtailed.<br />\nWe feel sure, however, that the Association will not have cause to regret its publicspirited action.

This<br />\nmakes the third consecutive victory; and<br />\nwhile the contest was closer than ever hefore, nevertheless Hopkins won by the comfortable margin of 12 points-58 to 46.<br />\nThe track was in first class shape and fast<br />\ntime was made in most of the events.

Lawson did the next best,<br />\ngetting one first and two seconds out of the<br />\nfive events in which he was entered.<br />\nTwo Maryland records were broken. Hill<br />\nran the 120 yard hurdles in 16A seconds, and<br />\nGriffith lowered the time in the mile to 4<br />\nminutes, 49 seconds. Unfortunately, Griffith's record will not count, since through a<br />\nmistake there were but two timers present,<br />\nwhile the rules require three.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nThe 120 yard hurdles was a beautiful race<br />\nwhich took two heats to decide the winner.<br />\nThe first heat resulted in a tie between Hill.<br />\n.1.

At the beginning of<br />\nthe year, we could put our hands on 6 or 8<br />\nnew undergraduates, and our eyes on 4 or 5<br />\nnew medical men. We never get past this<br />\nwith the majority of the latter.<br />\nThe first contest of the year was the Hopkins Indoor Meet, which We won by a comfortable margin. It was impossible to get<br />\na line on the team owing to the lack of room<br />\nin which to spread itself.<br />\nThen we<br />\njourneyed to 'Washington and found the<br />\npoints so scattered that our 2 firsts\u2014in the<br />\n880 and 440\u2014and a second in the 880 also,<br />\nwon us the Georgetown Indoor Meet.<br />\nOur outdoor season opened with the Penn<br />\nNelay races, where we found ourselves in<br />\na higher class than ever before. We contented ourselves\u2014of necessity\u2014with not taking last place. Then on May 13, we rubbed<br />\nit in on Virginia for the third time straight,<br />\nafter they had made more than certain of the<br />\nresult by demanding the discus, along with<br />\nthe shot and the hammer. The final score<br />\nwas 58 to 46, though to make. it we had to<br />\nbreak several State records. These records<br />\nwere not allowed, however, as there were<br />\nonly two timers present.<br />\nOn May 20, we entered the whole team<br />\nin the South Atlantic Championships, and<br />\ngot second against the combined forces of<br />\nWest Branch Y. M. C. A., Tome, Balto. Med.<br />\nCol., Mt. Washington, and Md. A. C., which<br />\nwere all thrown in together and labelled<br />\nM. A. C. The State Records in the in<br />\nbroad jump, and high hurdles were broken<br />\nby Hopkins men, but we lost the meet<br />\nthrough our lack of weight-men. The score<br />\nwas: M. A. C., 53; II. U., 37\u2014with the rest<br />\nnowhere in sight.<br />\nOn May 26-27, we will be represented at<br />\nFranklin Field in the inter-collegiates in the<br />\nmile, 880, broad jump, and low hurdles. The<br />\nchances of placing are rather slim, however.<br />\nJ. S. HILL,<br />\nCaptain, 1904-'05.<br />\n<br />\nRESUME OF THE LACROSSE<br />\nSEASON.<br />\nNo doubt it would seem from a cursory<br />\nglance that the present season has been unsuccessful, but it must be remembered that<br />\nour squad was composed mainly of raw recruits. The only old men were Schmeisser,<br />\nBlanck, Dill, Strobhar and Meyer. All of<br />\nthese had their hands full teaching the new<br />\nmen, most of whom had never played lacrosse at all.<br />\nThe result of the season was as follows:\u2014<br />\nApril 8\u2014University of Pennsylvania 0,<br />\nJohns 1 lopkins 9.<br />\nApril 15-1 la rvard 4, _Hopkins 3.<br />\nApril ,22\u2014Stevens 1, Hopkins 15.<br />\nApril 29\u2014T4eh1gh 3, 'Hopkins 4.<br />\nMay 6\u2014Mt. Washington 2, Hopkins 2.<br />\nMay 13\u2014Swarthmore 16, Hopkins 4.<br />\nOut of the six games Hopkins won three<br />\ngames, tied one and lost two.<br />\nHopkins total score 37; scored by its opponents, 26.<br />\nJudging from the total score, therefore,<br />\nit would seem that Hopkins is still strong,<br />\nwhen we come to consider that we had the<br />\nmisfortune to lose one of our best men in<br />\nthe Harvard game at the most critical point<br />\nof the season. However, we must also<br />\nmember that our team was radically weak,<br />\nmost notably at in-home.<br />\nAlso we would not be hurt one bit if we<br />\ntook a few points from our opponents. We<br />\nmight very well change our style of play to<br />\nthat which Swarthmore used against us, but<br />\ntheir method of training seems to be so far<br />\nsuperior to ours, that it would seem a good<br />\npolicy to adopt at least a part of their system.<br />\nAnd now a word or two in regard to the<br />\nteam which We hope will regain for us our<br />\nlaurels in the coming season. We lose but<br />\nthree men, but these three men are three of<br />\nthe strongest on the team, and they are men<br />\nwho have made the game a study and whose<br />\nfaithful work will be greatly missed. At<br />\npresent there are no candidates eminently<br />\nfitted for these positions. It remains for<br />\nthe squad of next year to develop them.<br />\nBut judging from the interest displayed by<br />\nthe present members of the ten ti nd the<br />\ninterest which is being taken in the game<br />\nin some of the preparatory institutions of<br />\nthe city, we are confident that before the<br />\nsquad has been in practice many weeks there<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n13<br />\n<br />\nLacrosse Team 1905.<br />\nwill be strong rivalry for these positions.<br />\n!knee it seems that we have a good outlook<br />\nfor a most successful smson.<br />\nIn view of these things, perhaps it is not<br />\nout of place to say a word in regard to the<br />\nattendance of the students. Our team is<br />\nrecognized everywhere as one of the strongest collegiate teams of the country; and is<br />\ncertainly the strongest branch of athletics<br />\nin the rniversity. I do not wish to make<br />\nit appear I hat it is a duty for every student<br />\nto attend all games\u2014they should rather consider it a pleasure\u2014and I am sure that if<br />\nmany of the men who at the present time<br />\ntake no interest whatsoever in the team<br />\nwould attend a few of the games, they would<br />\nbegin to realize that this is one of the most<br />\nfascinating. sports that. ever they had the<br />\ngood fortune to witness.<br />\nIn closing, I would like to eongratulate<br />\nthe team as a whole upon their remarkable<br />\nshowing in the up-hill struggle, through<br />\nwhich they have just passed. Thanks are<br />\ndue to Capin in Dill for his vonstant work.<br />\nalso to the old players who have aidpd by<br />\ncoaching the teant. Especial thanks are due<br />\n<br />\nto coach Schmeisser, whose loyal and earnest efforts will never be forgotten by all<br />\nmembers of the team who have profited by<br />\nhis teaching. \"The labor of love,\" so generously given' by \"Father Bill\" will ever<br />\nbe remembered.<br />\nJ. EARLE MIFFLIN,<br />\nManager.<br />\n<br />\nSWARTHMORE, 16; HOPKINS,4.<br />\nJust three weeks ago to-day, our good<br />\nstar had reached the loftiest heights of the<br />\nheavens, and smiled down upon the lacrosse<br />\nenthusiasts with all of its radiant brilliancy,<br />\nfor on the following day we were to meet<br />\nSwarthmore in the annual game_for the<br />\nintercollegiate lacrosse honors. The defense<br />\nwas invincible, and the attack could not be<br />\nchecked in its mad career when advancing<br />\nthe ball down the field upon Swarthmore's<br />\ngoal! Such were the opinions of some, and<br />\nsuch we all tried to persuade ourselves would<br />\nbe the case.<br />\n13ut, sad to relate, when the contest began, it was seen that our star was on the<br />\ndescendant, and 'our fondest hopes were<br />\n<br />\n\f14<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nsoon shattered. The game was played and<br />\nwon\u2014by Swarthmore\u2014the championship<br />\nlost, and all by the overwhelming score of<br />\n16 to 4.<br />\nThis is the largest score ever rolled up<br />\nagainst any team wearing the Black and<br />\nBlue, and to think that it should be made<br />\nby Swarthmore, a team which, for years,<br />\nHopkins held between the finger and thumb.<br />\nThat day will always be remembered here<br />\nas a particularly sad one in Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nhistory, arid one which will bring pain to<br />\ntrue followers of the Black and Blue whenever they come to reflect upon it.<br />\nFrom the very first face-off, it was clearly<br />\nseen that Hopkins was up against a tough<br />\nproposition. Our players found it hard to<br />\nbe in the right place at the proper time,<br />\nand verily -there was many \"a slip 'twixt<br />\nball and stick.\" 'Whenever the ball did<br />\nstick we found it rather hard to advance<br />\nit towards Swarthmore's goal, for one, and<br />\nsometimes three and four, of her defense<br />\nwould pounce down up(m our runner, have<br />\na \"pot social\" with him, get the ball, sail<br />\nit up the field, and leave him to pull himself<br />\ntogether and hobble back into place.<br />\nThis was Swarthmore's play, and so well<br />\ndid it work that she had made six goals,<br />\nbefore Hudgins was able to get through her<br />\ndefense for our first goal.<br />\nA short time<br />\nlater Hudgins duplicated his former performance, and only a few minutes before time was<br />\ncalled, Strobhar was able to make our third<br />\nscore.<br />\nThe score was now 9 to 3, and although<br />\nthere wer.e some who predicted Swarthmore<br />\ncould not hold the pace set in the first half,<br />\nand we would be able to make up the lost<br />\nground, such surmises proved to be without<br />\nfoundation. For in the. second half, our opponents played just as fast, if not a little<br />\nfaster.<br />\nSwarthmore led off with the first goal,<br />\nand Dill followed a few minutes later wtih<br />\nHopkins' fourth score.<br />\nIt did look considerably brighter for Hopkins at this juncture, but this ray of hope was of short duration. Despite our noble efforts to score by<br />\nrunning part, of the defense down the field<br />\nto help the attack, we were unable to advance our score, while on the other hand,<br />\nSwarthmore made six more goals.<br />\nWe all admit this was a hard game to<br />\nlose, but quite a different light is thrown on<br />\n<br />\nthe matter when we reflect upon the fact<br />\nthat our team was composed mostly of inexperienced players. We will be stronger next season, and we all hope to see a team<br />\nstrong enough to capture the lacrosse pennant, and bring it home to decorate the walls<br />\nof our Trophy Room.<br />\nThe line-up:<br />\nHopk<br />\nPosition.<br />\nSwarthmore.<br />\nW.

This word<br />\nof a ppeal seems, however, to have escaped<br />\nthe eyes of most of our readers. Certainly<br />\nthe wretched attendance at the concert last<br />\nweek justifies this belief, for we should not<br />\nthink that any one did see our remarks and<br />\ntook no heed.<br />\nAside from the fact that<br />\nit is the duty of every student to enhance<br />\nthe success of any concert given by the<br />\nMusical Clubs of the University, this one<br />\nin particular should have had the full support of the student body.

It is another instance of one of the older colleges following<br />\nour lead. Harvard copied us before, in allowing a man his A. B. degree after three<br />\nyears of work. We are often not appreciated, however.

First, that when two<br />\nathletic teams meet not more than olle can<br />\npossibly win ; second, that it is by ii() means<br />\nincumbent on Fate alWa vs to decree that the<br />\nfortunate team shall be the one which wears<br />\nthe Hopkins colors. judging from the conversation of some men (for the most part<br />\nthose who take no part in athletics themselves and who get all. their information<br />\nabout a game out of the next morning's<br />\npaper), no team has the right to exist which<br />\ndoes not make a habit of winning championships. To be sure the lacrosse team got a<br />\npretty severe drubbing from Swarthmore.<br />\nWe are well aware, also, that the baseball<br />\nteam has played in hard luck all season.<br />\nYet we see no reason for discouragement,<br />\ncertainly not for blame, in the record of<br />\neither team.

The plan<br />\n'for season tickets was neither originated nor<br />\nwas it fostered by the Association.. It is no<br />\ncunning plan to collect more money from<br />\nstudents. On the other hand, it is a measure<br />\nput forward by the students themselves with<br />\na. view toward their own benefit. We believe<br />\nthat in the end the Association will also<br />\ngain, but in the beginning it obviously assumes considerable risk. The selling-price<br />\nfor tickets is calculated on the asKumption<br />\nthat the whole, or nearly the whole, of the<br />\nstudent-body will purchase; and should any<br />\nI arge pmportion of the students fail to do<br />\nso, the income of the teams might be seriously curtailed.<br />\nWe feel sure, however, that the Association will not have cause to regret its publicspirited action. The following letters from<br />\nthe two undergraduate classes which will<br />\nreturn to the University next year make the<br />\nsentiments of the University at large plainer<br />\nthan any words of ours could do.

At the beginning of<br />\nthe year, we could put our hands on 6 or 8<br />\nnew undergraduates, and our eyes on 4 or 5<br />\nnew medical men. We never get past this<br />\nwith the majority of the latter.<br />\nThe first contest of the year was the Hopkins Indoor Meet, which We won by a comfortable margin. It was impossible to get<br />\na line on the team owing to the lack of room<br />\nin which to spread itself.<br />\nThen we<br />\njourneyed to 'Washington and found the<br />\npoints so scattered that our 2 firsts\u2014in the<br />\n880 and 440\u2014and a second in the 880 also,<br />\nwon us the Georgetown Indoor Meet.<br />\nOur outdoor season opened with the Penn<br />\nNelay races, where we found ourselves in<br />\na higher class than ever before. We contented ourselves\u2014of necessity\u2014with not taking last place. Then on May 13, we rubbed<br />\nit in on Virginia for the third time straight,<br />\nafter they had made more than certain of the<br />\nresult by demanding the discus, along with<br />\nthe shot and the hammer. The final score<br />\nwas 58 to 46, though to make. it we had to<br />\nbreak several State records. These records<br />\nwere not allowed, however, as there were<br />\nonly two timers present.<br />\nOn May 20, we entered the whole team<br />\nin the South Atlantic Championships, and<br />\ngot second against the combined forces of<br />\nWest Branch Y. M. C. A., Tome, Balto. Med.<br />\nCol., Mt. Washington, and Md. A. C., which<br />\nwere all thrown in together and labelled<br />\nM. A. C. The State Records in the in<br />\nbroad jump, and high hurdles were broken<br />\nby Hopkins men, but we lost the meet<br />\nthrough our lack of weight-men. The score<br />\nwas: M. A. C., 53; II. U., 37\u2014with the rest<br />\nnowhere in sight.<br />\nOn May 26-27, we will be represented at<br />\nFranklin Field in the inter-collegiates in the<br />\nmile, 880, broad jump, and low hurdles. The<br />\nchances of placing are rather slim, however.<br />\nJ. S. HILL,<br />\nCaptain, 1904-'05.<br /><br />\nRESUME OF THE LACROSSE<br />\nSEASON.<br />\nNo doubt it would seem from a cursory<br />\nglance that the present season has been unsuccessful, but it must be remembered that<br />\nour squad was composed mainly of raw recruits. The only old men were Schmeisser,<br />\nBlanck, Dill, Strobhar and Meyer. All of<br />\nthese had their hands full teaching the new<br />\nmen, most of whom had never played lacrosse at all.<br />\nThe result of the season was as follows:\u2014<br />\nApril 8\u2014University of Pennsylvania 0,<br />\nJohns 1 lopkins 9.<br />\nApril 15-1 la rvard 4, _Hopkins 3.<br />\nApril ,22\u2014Stevens 1, Hopkins 15.<br />\nApril 29\u2014T4eh1gh 3, 'Hopkins 4.<br />\nMay 6\u2014Mt. Washington 2, Hopkins 2.<br />\nMay 13\u2014Swarthmore 16, Hopkins 4.<br />\nOut of the six games Hopkins won three<br />\ngames, tied one and lost two.<br />\nHopkins total score 37; scored by its opponents, 26.<br />\nJudging from the total score, therefore,<br />\nit would seem that Hopkins is still strong,<br />\nwhen we come to consider that we had the<br />\nmisfortune to lose one of our best men in<br />\nthe Harvard game at the most critical point<br />\nof the season. However, we must also<br />\nmember that our team was radically weak,<br />\nmost notably at in-home.<br />\nAlso we would not be hurt one bit if we<br />\ntook a few points from our opponents. We<br />\nmight very well change our style of play to<br />\nthat which Swarthmore used against us, but<br />\ntheir method of training seems to be so far<br />\nsuperior to ours, that it would seem a good<br />\npolicy to adopt at least a part of their system.<br />\nAnd now a word or two in regard to the<br />\nteam which We hope will regain for us our<br />\nlaurels in the coming season. We lose but<br />\nthree men, but these three men are three of<br />\nthe strongest on the team, and they are men<br />\nwho have made the game a study and whose<br />\nfaithful work will be greatly missed. At<br />\npresent there are no candidates eminently<br />\nfitted for these positions. It remains for<br />\nthe squad of next year to develop them.<br />\nBut judging from the interest displayed by<br />\nthe present members of the ten ti nd the<br />\ninterest which is being taken in the game<br />\nin some of the preparatory institutions of<br />\nthe city, we are confident that before the<br />\nsquad has been in practice many weeks there<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n13<br /><br />\nLacrosse Team 1905.<br />\nwill be strong rivalry for these positions.<br />\n!knee it seems that we have a good outlook<br />\nfor a most successful smson.<br />\nIn view of these things, perhaps it is not<br />\nout of place to say a word in regard to the<br />\nattendance of the students. Our team is<br />\nrecognized everywhere as one of the strongest collegiate teams of the country; and is<br />\ncertainly the strongest branch of athletics<br />\nin the rniversity. I do not wish to make<br />\nit appear I hat it is a duty for every student<br />\nto attend all games\u2014they should rather consider it a pleasure\u2014and I am sure that if<br />\nmany of the men who at the present time<br />\ntake no interest whatsoever in the team<br />\nwould attend a few of the games, they would<br />\nbegin to realize that this is one of the most<br />\nfascinating. sports that. ever they had the<br />\ngood fortune to witness.<br />\nIn closing, I would like to eongratulate<br />\nthe team as a whole upon their remarkable<br />\nshowing in the up-hill struggle, through<br />\nwhich they have just passed. Thanks are<br />\ndue to Capin in Dill for his vonstant work.<br />\nalso to the old players who have aidpd by<br />\ncoaching the teant. Especial thanks are due<br /><br />\nto coach Schmeisser, whose loyal and earnest efforts will never be forgotten by all<br />\nmembers of the team who have profited by<br />\nhis teaching. \"The labor of love,\" so generously given' by \"Father Bill\" will ever<br />\nbe remembered.<br />\nJ. EARLE MIFFLIN,<br />\nManager.<br /><br />\nSWARTHMORE, 16; HOPKINS,4.<br />\nJust three weeks ago to-day, our good<br />\nstar had reached the loftiest heights of the<br />\nheavens, and smiled down upon the lacrosse<br />\nenthusiasts with all of its radiant brilliancy,<br />\nfor on the following day we were to meet<br />\nSwarthmore in the annual game_for the<br />\nintercollegiate lacrosse honors. The defense<br />\nwas invincible, and the attack could not be<br />\nchecked in its mad career when advancing<br />\nthe ball down the field upon Swarthmore's<br />\ngoal! Such were the opinions of some, and<br />\nsuch we all tried to persuade ourselves would<br />\nbe the case.<br />\n13ut, sad to relate, when the contest began, it was seen that our star was on the<br />\ndescendant, and 'our fondest hopes were<br /><br />\n14<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nsoon shattered. The game was played and<br />\nwon\u2014by Swarthmore\u2014the championship<br />\nlost, and all by the overwhelming score of<br />\n16 to 4.<br />\nThis is the largest score ever rolled up<br />\nagainst any team wearing the Black and<br />\nBlue, and to think that it should be made<br />\nby Swarthmore, a team which, for years,<br />\nHopkins held between the finger and thumb.<br />\nThat day will always be remembered here<br />\nas a particularly sad one in Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nhistory, arid one which will bring pain to<br />\ntrue followers of the Black and Blue whenever they come to reflect upon it.<br />\nFrom the very first face-off, it was clearly<br />\nseen that Hopkins was up against a tough<br />\nproposition. Our players found it hard to<br />\nbe in the right place at the proper time,<br />\nand verily -there was many \"a slip 'twixt<br />\nball and stick.\" 'Whenever the ball did<br />\nstick we found it rather hard to advance<br />\nit towards Swarthmore's goal, for one, and<br />\nsometimes three and four, of her defense<br />\nwould pounce down up(m our runner, have<br />\na \"pot social\" with him, get the ball, sail<br />\nit up the field, and leave him to pull himself<br />\ntogether and hobble back into place.<br />\nThis was Swarthmore's play, and so well<br />\ndid it work that she had made six goals,<br />\nbefore Hudgins was able to get through her<br />\ndefense for our first goal.<br />\nA short time<br />\nlater Hudgins duplicated his former performance, and only a few minutes before time was<br />\ncalled, Strobhar was able to make our third<br />\nscore.<br />\nThe score was now 9 to 3, and although<br />\nthere wer.e some who predicted Swarthmore<br />\ncould not hold the pace set in the first half,<br />\nand we would be able to make up the lost<br />\nground, such surmises proved to be without<br />\nfoundation. For in the. second half, our opponents played just as fast, if not a little<br />\nfaster.<br />\nSwarthmore led off with the first goal,<br />\nand Dill followed a few minutes later wtih<br />\nHopkins' fourth score.<br />\nIt did look considerably brighter for Hopkins at this juncture, but this ray of hope was of short duration. Despite our noble efforts to score by<br />\nrunning part, of the defense down the field<br />\nto help the attack, we were unable to advance our score, while on the other hand,<br />\nSwarthmore made six more goals.<br />\nWe all admit this was a hard game to<br />\nlose, but quite a different light is thrown on<br /><br />\nthe matter when we reflect upon the fact<br />\nthat our team was composed mostly of inexperienced players. We will be stronger next season, and we all hope to see a team<br />\nstrong enough to capture the lacrosse pennant, and bring it home to decorate the walls<br />\nof our Trophy Room.<br />\nThe line-up:<br />\nHopk<br />\nPosition.<br />\nSwarthmore.<br />\nW.
