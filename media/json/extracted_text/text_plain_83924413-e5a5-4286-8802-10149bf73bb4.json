This is a remark that<br />\nmakes a great deal more sense<br />\nthan it would seem, once we<br />\nrealize that virtually all the<br />\nadult opposition to the war<br />\ncomes from the afore-mentioned<br />\nsocial class, and that of the<br />\nyounger people from their children. Prof. Roche is merely suggesting, and correctly, I would<br />\nsubmit, tha\u2022t one of the greatest<br />\ncomponents of the dissent over<br />\nthe war is the fear of the draft<br />\nby a group of people who have<br />\nthe most to fear from it.<br />\nIt's really quite simple. Without the war in Viet Nam, the<br />\ndraft is really not a factor in<br />\ntoo many people's lives. With the<br />\nwar being maintained at its present level, however, no one is<br />\nreally immune from draft pressures. Now with the poorer segments of the population, the<br />\nArmy has always been a healthful and welcome respite from the<br />\ndrudgery of a marginal existence. It's for damn sure that the<br />\naverage Black from South Baltimore isn't about to get the opportunity to travel to places like<br />\nOkinawa or Seoul, or Stuttgart<br />\nwithout the kind services of the<br />\nG.I. travel agency.<br />\n<br />\nWe admit that the pay is not<br />\nall that great. But, then again,<br />\nthe bulk of the draftees weren't<br />\ndoing all that better on the outside anyway; and besides, the<br />\nfringe benefits, as we have<br />\npointed out, are well worth the<br />\ncut in cash pay.<br />\nThis is all very nice: very nice<br />\nthat is, if your future isn't about<br />\nto be too very exciting\u2014you<br />\nknow, sort of the same shoddy<br />\nlife your folks have been living for generations. Very nice\u2014<br />\nif your ambitions don't run any<br />\nfurther than a 'good' job at a<br />\nhundred and a half a week, a<br />\ncheap house in a lousy suburb,<br />\nand the same for your kids, and<br />\nhopefully theirs as well.The Army<br />\ncan't hurt you then; except<br />\nmaybe you might get killed. But<br />\nthat's the risk you run, and<br />\nyou'll be defending our country\u2014<br />\nall that jazz. It'll be a good experience.<br />\n<br />\nBroadening Experience<br />\n<br />\nUniversal Unfairness ...<br />\ngreat<br />\nThe draft has proven to be one of the<br />\ns to<br />\npurport<br />\nwhich<br />\nanachronisms of our time. hi a nation<br />\nall,<br />\nfor<br />\nrights<br />\nequal<br />\nand<br />\ncy<br />\ndemocra<br />\nbe the strongbed of<br />\ndraft in<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nbias<br />\nnatural<br />\nthe<br />\nthat<br />\nshown<br />\nbeen<br />\nit has<br />\nlower class<br />\nthe past is against negroes, youths of the<br />\nor finanmental<br />\nfor<br />\ncollege<br />\nattend<br />\nto<br />\nunable<br />\nand others<br />\ncial reasons.<br />\nwe<br />\nWe abhor the fact that this has existed, and<br />\nsteps to<br />\ntaking<br />\nfor<br />\nsion<br />\nCommis<br />\nl<br />\nMarshal<br />\nthe<br />\napplaud<br />\nmethod<br />\ninitiate a random selection system, \"the only<br />\nnt<br />\nPreside<br />\nas<br />\n,\"<br />\nfairness<br />\ne<br />\ncomplet<br />\nhes<br />\nhieh approac<br />\non<br />\ndefiniti<br />\nby<br />\nwhich<br />\nJohnson has said. Any draft system,<br />\nhis<br />\nwithout<br />\nservices<br />\narmed<br />\nthe<br />\nforces a person to enter<br />\nng<br />\npersonal volition, is naturally unfair. But this reasoni<br />\nnoning<br />\ndemand<br />\nvery<br />\na<br />\nserves little purpose; we are in<br />\nwar, and as long as the government wishes to pursue<br />\nin it, we are but their pawns.<br />\nThe most significant problem of the draft which<br />\nfaces Congress now is what to do with undergraduates.<br />\nEveryone seems to agree that the best soldier\u2014which we<br />\nand<br />\ntake to mean he who can be most easily molded<br />\nwho values his life the highest\u2014is the 19 year old. This<br />\nwe agree with, not for the above reasons, but rather because it would cause the least interruption of his life.<br />\nHopefully, after his two year service he would be ind him through the<br />\nclined to use the scholarship afforde'<br />\nG.L Bill to further his education.<br />\nBut there are many 18 and 19 year olds\u2014presumably the bulk of Hopkins students are or were in<br />\nthis category\u2014who plan to earn Ph.D.'s, a goal which<br />\ndemands 8 to 10 years of their lives. They are the one<br />\npercent of our population, the mentally privileged. They<br />\ncan not afford an added two years of what would be<br />\nwasted time.<br />\nIf this one percent elite should in fact be deferred<br />\nfrom the draft, the only feasible way to achieve it is<br />\nthrough a challenging and demanding set of exams.<br />\nThis does not mean the infamous and fatuous \"war<br />\nboards\" of the last two years, but rather something in<br />\nthe line of comprehensive exams in a person's major<br />\narea of stiffly, whether it be medicine, dentistry, or<br />\nEnglish.<br />\nThis is an \"elitist\" view, but applicable only for<br />\nthose capable of earning a Ph.D. degree. Educational<br />\ndeferments are now held by 1.7 million students. Under<br />\nthe suggested system above, only about 200,000 deferments would be awarded. Everyone else would be included in the pool of eligible men at 19, and would have<br />\nto serve if chosen. Only after their two years were<br />\nfinished would they be able to pursue the luxury of a<br />\ncollege education.<br />\n<br />\ncan look forward to the fabled<br />\n'year off' anymore? A guy can't<br />\neven ski bum for six months<br />\nwithout his draft board sending<br />\nhim friendly greetings and pesky<br />\ninduction notices. Really, if a<br />\nguy can't enjoy the greatest asset of economic well being, leisure time, then what's the point<br />\nof having the dough to begin<br />\nwith?<br />\nOur beloved President makes<br />\na big deal of making the draft<br />\nFAIR. But let's just realize who<br />\nthe draft is really unfair to. It's<br />\nnot the slum kid who's getting<br />\nthe raw deal out of the Army.<br />\nHell, the Army can't be any<br />\nworse than where he came from<br />\nin the first place. But for the Big<br />\nNoise from Winetka or Shaker<br />\nHeights or Grosse Pointe or<br />\nGreat Neck, the draft is a royal<br />\nshaft. The Army is very simply,<br />\na drag. You don't get anything<br />\nout of it. You don't really do<br />\nanyone any good by being in it,<br />\nand conceivably, you could really<br />\nget screwed up by the whole<br />\nthing. Who needs it, really?<br />\n<br />\nthe two years just for themselves.<br />\nAnd don't forget, when you get<br />\nout, the uniform is just the<br />\nthing to wear around the gas<br />\nstation or the warehouse. The<br />\nmilitary look and all that; tres<br />\nchic, you know.<br />\n<br />\nIt's Unfair<br />\n<br />\nPain in the Neck<br />\nHowever, there are a few people in the country for whom the<br />\ndraft is a giant sized pain in<br />\nthe neck. And these are the<br />\npeople about whom Prof. Roche<br />\nIs talking. You see, these kids<br />\nhave already done their traveling abroad. They've already had<br />\ntheir share of dormitory living\u2014<br />\nor at least they've gone to sleep<br />\naway camp, for God's sake. They<br />\nhave lots of nice clothes; and<br />\nif they need to look military.<br />\nthey can bop down to Limbo, or<br />\nup to the attic and cull from<br />\nDaddy's old officer's uniforms.<br />\n(What is this enlist man jazz,<br />\nanyhow?)<br />\n<br />\nThe Army is, if you come from<br />\na pretty dull background to start<br />\nwith, a real broadening experience. I mean, if you haven't gone<br />\nto boarding school, where else<br />\nwill you learn the virtues of<br />\ncommunal living? Army uniFor these kids the draft ruins<br />\nforms are glamourous additions<br />\nto any man's wardrobe, and as their education, and worse, ruins<br />\nfree items are definitely worth their vacations.

This is a remark that<br />\nmakes a great deal more sense<br />\nthan it would seem, once we<br />\nrealize that virtually all the<br />\nadult opposition to the war<br />\ncomes from the afore-mentioned<br />\nsocial class, and that of the<br />\nyounger people from their children. Prof. Roche is merely suggesting, and correctly, I would<br />\nsubmit, tha\u2022t one of the greatest<br />\ncomponents of the dissent over<br />\nthe war is the fear of the draft<br />\nby a group of people who have<br />\nthe most to fear from it.<br />\nIt's really quite simple. Without the war in Viet Nam, the<br />\ndraft is really not a factor in<br />\ntoo many people's lives. With the<br />\nwar being maintained at its present level, however, no one is<br />\nreally immune from draft pressures. Now with the poorer segments of the population, the<br />\nArmy has always been a healthful and welcome respite from the<br />\ndrudgery of a marginal existence. It's for damn sure that the<br />\naverage Black from South Baltimore isn't about to get the opportunity to travel to places like<br />\nOkinawa or Seoul, or Stuttgart<br />\nwithout the kind services of the<br />\nG.I. travel agency.<br /><br />\nWe admit that the pay is not<br />\nall that great. But, then again,<br />\nthe bulk of the draftees weren't<br />\ndoing all that better on the outside anyway; and besides, the<br />\nfringe benefits, as we have<br />\npointed out, are well worth the<br />\ncut in cash pay.<br />\nThis is all very nice: very nice<br />\nthat is, if your future isn't about<br />\nto be too very exciting\u2014you<br />\nknow, sort of the same shoddy<br />\nlife your folks have been living for generations. Very nice\u2014<br />\nif your ambitions don't run any<br />\nfurther than a 'good' job at a<br />\nhundred and a half a week, a<br />\ncheap house in a lousy suburb,<br />\nand the same for your kids, and<br />\nhopefully theirs as well.The Army<br />\ncan't hurt you then; except<br />\nmaybe you might get killed. But<br />\nthat's the risk you run, and<br />\nyou'll be defending our country\u2014<br />\nall that jazz. It'll be a good experience.<br /><br />\nBroadening Experience<br /><br />\nUniversal Unfairness ...<br />\ngreat<br />\nThe draft has proven to be one of the<br />\ns to<br />\npurport<br />\nwhich<br />\nanachronisms of our time. hi a nation<br />\nall,<br />\nfor<br />\nrights<br />\nequal<br />\nand<br />\ncy<br />\ndemocra<br />\nbe the strongbed of<br />\ndraft in<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nbias<br />\nnatural<br />\nthe<br />\nthat<br />\nshown<br />\nbeen<br />\nit has<br />\nlower class<br />\nthe past is against negroes, youths of the<br />\nor finanmental<br />\nfor<br />\ncollege<br />\nattend<br />\nto<br />\nunable<br />\nand others<br />\ncial reasons.<br />\nwe<br />\nWe abhor the fact that this has existed, and<br />\nsteps to<br />\ntaking<br />\nfor<br />\nsion<br />\nCommis<br />\nl<br />\nMarshal<br />\nthe<br />\napplaud<br />\nmethod<br />\ninitiate a random selection system, \"the only<br />\nnt<br />\nPreside<br />\nas<br />\n,\"<br />\nfairness<br />\ne<br />\ncomplet<br />\nhes<br />\nhieh approac<br />\non<br />\ndefiniti<br />\nby<br />\nwhich<br />\nJohnson has said. Any draft system,<br />\nhis<br />\nwithout<br />\nservices<br />\narmed<br />\nthe<br />\nforces a person to enter<br />\nng<br />\npersonal volition, is naturally unfair. But this reasoni<br />\nnoning<br />\ndemand<br />\nvery<br />\na<br />\nserves little purpose; we are in<br />\nwar, and as long as the government wishes to pursue<br />\nin it, we are but their pawns.<br />\nThe most significant problem of the draft which<br />\nfaces Congress now is what to do with undergraduates.<br />\nEveryone seems to agree that the best soldier\u2014which we<br />\nand<br />\ntake to mean he who can be most easily molded<br />\nwho values his life the highest\u2014is the 19 year old. This<br />\nwe agree with, not for the above reasons, but rather because it would cause the least interruption of his life.<br />\nHopefully, after his two year service he would be ind him through the<br />\nclined to use the scholarship afforde'<br />\nG.L Bill to further his education.<br />\nBut there are many 18 and 19 year olds\u2014presumably the bulk of Hopkins students are or were in<br />\nthis category\u2014who plan to earn Ph.D.'s, a goal which<br />\ndemands 8 to 10 years of their lives. They are the one<br />\npercent of our population, the mentally privileged. They<br />\ncan not afford an added two years of what would be<br />\nwasted time.<br />\nIf this one percent elite should in fact be deferred<br />\nfrom the draft, the only feasible way to achieve it is<br />\nthrough a challenging and demanding set of exams.<br />\nThis does not mean the infamous and fatuous \"war<br />\nboards\" of the last two years, but rather something in<br />\nthe line of comprehensive exams in a person's major<br />\narea of stiffly, whether it be medicine, dentistry, or<br />\nEnglish.<br />\nThis is an \"elitist\" view, but applicable only for<br />\nthose capable of earning a Ph.D. degree. Educational<br />\ndeferments are now held by 1.7 million students. Under<br />\nthe suggested system above, only about 200,000 deferments would be awarded. Everyone else would be included in the pool of eligible men at 19, and would have<br />\nto serve if chosen. Only after their two years were<br />\nfinished would they be able to pursue the luxury of a<br />\ncollege education.<br /><br />\ncan look forward to the fabled<br />\n'year off' anymore? A guy can't<br />\neven ski bum for six months<br />\nwithout his draft board sending<br />\nhim friendly greetings and pesky<br />\ninduction notices. Really, if a<br />\nguy can't enjoy the greatest asset of economic well being, leisure time, then what's the point<br />\nof having the dough to begin<br />\nwith?<br />\nOur beloved President makes<br />\na big deal of making the draft<br />\nFAIR. But let's just realize who<br />\nthe draft is really unfair to. It's<br />\nnot the slum kid who's getting<br />\nthe raw deal out of the Army.<br />\nHell, the Army can't be any<br />\nworse than where he came from<br />\nin the first place. But for the Big<br />\nNoise from Winetka or Shaker<br />\nHeights or Grosse Pointe or<br />\nGreat Neck, the draft is a royal<br />\nshaft. The Army is very simply,<br />\na drag. You don't get anything<br />\nout of it. You don't really do<br />\nanyone any good by being in it,<br />\nand conceivably, you could really<br />\nget screwed up by the whole<br />\nthing. Who needs it, really?<br /><br />\nthe two years just for themselves.<br />\nAnd don't forget, when you get<br />\nout, the uniform is just the<br />\nthing to wear around the gas<br />\nstation or the warehouse. The<br />\nmilitary look and all that; tres<br />\nchic, you know.<br /><br />\nIt's Unfair<br /><br />\nPain in the Neck<br />\nHowever, there are a few people in the country for whom the<br />\ndraft is a giant sized pain in<br />\nthe neck. And these are the<br />\npeople about whom Prof. Roche<br />\nIs talking. You see, these kids<br />\nhave already done their traveling abroad. They've already had<br />\ntheir share of dormitory living\u2014<br />\nor at least they've gone to sleep<br />\naway camp, for God's sake. They<br />\nhave lots of nice clothes; and<br />\nif they need to look military.<br />\nthey can bop down to Limbo, or<br />\nup to the attic and cull from<br />\nDaddy's old officer's uniforms.<br />\n(What is this enlist man jazz,<br />\nanyhow?)<br /><br />\nThe Army is, if you come from<br />\na pretty dull background to start<br />\nwith, a real broadening experience. I mean, if you haven't gone<br />\nto boarding school, where else<br />\nwill you learn the virtues of<br />\ncommunal living? Army uniFor these kids the draft ruins<br />\nforms are glamourous additions<br />\nto any man's wardrobe, and as their education, and worse, ruins<br />\nfree items are definitely worth their vacations.
