HOWARD STREET<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE<br /><br />\nThe sites of McCoy Hall and<br />\nLevering Hall will soon be sold<br />\nat private sale to the highest bidder. This is an extraordinary opportunity for the Baltimore City<br />\nCollege to expand.<br />\nThe entire block adjoining the<br />\nCity College on the north between<br />\nHoward, Eutaw and Druid Hill<br />\navenue, is now available for the<br />\nuse of the City College if the City<br />\nwill consider taking it over from<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nNo money would be required ne:<br />\ncessarily, since the University<br />\nwould probably be willing to take<br />\nCity Stock in payment; or, if the<br />\nCity desires to purchase the property out of the general budget,<br />\nthe University would probably accept one-fourth the exact amount<br />\nper year for a period of four<br />\nyears, meanwhile, occupying without rent the Chemical Laboratory<br />\nand Biological Laboratory. The<br />\nCity College, each year in the last<br />\nfour, has practically required an<br />\nadditional floor in the old Main<br />\nBuilding located in the block 'offered and is now occupying the<br />\nentire building as an Annex. This<br />\ngrowth will continue, as surely as<br />\nthe City is growing, and should<br />\nnow be provided for. Men of vision who urge taking over this<br />\nProperty before it is sold elsewhere will unquestionably do the<br />\nCity College and the City a genuine service.<br />\nIf this block is acquired by the<br />\nCity, the building there will serve<br />\nthe immediate needs of the City<br />\nCollege and in the future the<br />\nappearance and utility of the City<br />\nCollege may be substantially added to. In the first place, the<br />\n-architect who planned the City<br />\nCollege Building, evidently expected the buildings in front of it<br />\nto be razed or the street to be cut<br />\nthrough and, with that expectation in view, he put the entrance<br />\naround in what is now an alley.<br />\nThis situation can be appreciated,<br />\nespecially if one stands in front<br />\nof the main entrance of the City<br />\nCollege and looks at the building<br />\nfrom :that point of view. If this<br />\nsituation is gtraiglitened out, it<br />\nwill add tremendously to the value<br />\nof the College as a public building.<br />\nThis block, in addition to affording an open space in front of<br />\nthe City College, would also provide ample room for a Cage and<br />\nAnnex over near the Eutaw street<br />\nside while the space immediately<br />\nin front of the City College can be<br />\nused for a track and recreation<br />\nground, such as has been provided<br />\nfor the Polytechnic Institute, on<br />\nthe west side of Calvert street opposite its Main Building.
