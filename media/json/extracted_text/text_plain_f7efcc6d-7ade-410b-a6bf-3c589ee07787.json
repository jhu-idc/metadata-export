They have also beaten the Blue<br />\nJays, the team that was number three.<br />\nSpeaking of the Jays, they should have<br />\nbeen number two, having lost only to<br />\nSyracuse and having beaten a good team<br />\n(Virginia) with a clutch fourth quarter<br />\ngoal (Dressel to Wood on a beauty) on<br />\nSaturday. The Terps are a legitimate<br />\nnumber three (they're undefeated and<br />\ndid, after all, beat Carolina), and the Tar<br />\nHeels certainly shouldn't drop below number four.<br />\nThe real problem is that should the<br />\nJays\u2014pardon the obscenity\u2014lose to<br />\nCarolina on Saturday (a real possibility),<br />\nthey would be dangerously close to losing the home-field advantage for the<br />\nquarter-finals. Can you imagine?\u2014not<br />\na single play-off game at Homewood.<br />\nThe world would stop.<br />\nThe solution to all this is obvious.<br />\nEverybody should go to the game Saturday (since it's the first home contest since<br />\nMarch 8 y'all ought to be ready for<br />\nlacrosse), and be even louder than<br />\nnormal.<br />\nOh and one last thing\u2014far too few of<br />\nyou took our advice at the Syracuse game<br />\nto turn around, wave frantically and yell<br />\n\"Hi, Stevie!\" So come on, guys. This is<br />\nyour last chance.<br />\n<br />\nSpanking the HOP<br />\nMary Ellen Porter seems to be getting<br />\ninto the maternal spirit\u2014she's learning<br />\nto spank her own child. No, silly, we<br />\ndon't mean the actual kid, we mean the<br />\nHOP.<br />\nWell, okay, the HOP may not exactly<br />\nbe Porter's creature, but she is on its<br />\nboard, and it is at least as much an arm<br />\nof the administration as of the Student<br />\nCouncil. So when Porter suspended the<br />\nHOP for alcohol violations the other<br />\nday, it was far different than suspending<br />\na frat.<br />\nTo review a bit, the HOP was barred<br />\nfor one month from serving alcohol at<br />\nits functions. Since all campus social<br />\nevents must now be coordinated through<br />\nthe HOP, that actually means that<br />\nalcohol won't be served at any campus<br />\nevent. Furthermore, two IDs will be required at future events from everyone<br />\nwho wants to purchase alcohol.<br />\nThe thing that makes all of this a littie strange (and in some ways heartening) is that the HOP is in part an administration body. Both Porter and<br />\nDirector of Residential Life Andrea<br />\nPerry serve on its Board. While that may<br />\nnot seem like much at first glance, it is<br />\nfar more significant a role for the administration than existed under the<br />\nHOP's predecessor, the Social<br />\nCommittee.<br />\n<br />\nIndeed, that was one of the rationales<br />\nbehind the HOP's founding. It was<br />\ncreated, the old fogies will remember,<br />\nalmost two years ago. At the time, incoming Student Council President Jon<br />\nLana (along with a lot of other people)<br />\nthought the social programming structure for the campus needed an overhaul.<br />\nThe result was the HOP, which swallowed up a couple of smaller committees and<br />\ntook on the role of master schedulemaker for Homewood.<br />\nIt operated informally for about half<br />\nyear,<br />\nand then was offered (over, oddly<br />\na<br />\nenough, Porter's strong objections) to<br />\nthe student body for approval in a<br />\nreferendum. It passed overwhelmingly (it<br />\nwas hardly the most controversial vote<br />\nin the history of the school), and the<br />\nHOP was officially born.<br />\nSo a fair number of people were more<br />\nthan a little surprised when Porter<br />\nsuspended the HOP. Actually, though,<br />\nit's sort of refreshing. At least occasionally, it seems, the administration can<br />\nact fairly impartially, in this case almost<br />\nsuspending a part of itself. Indeed, the<br />\nevent for which the HOP got in trouble<br />\nwas a dance played by the Crusty<br />\nNostrils, a group that includes. . .Porter.<br />\nStill, considering the administration's<br />\ntrack record, this is a surprising (and<br />\npleasant) case of fairness.<br />\n<br />\nThe most grotesque thing Let us now dispel a popular<br />\naround here is Joe Chen's ig- Homewood myth: the council<br />\nnorance regarding many cam- and its committees are not<br />\npus affairs.

He accused that organization of being inevitably \"left of the leftof-center.\" And he was<br />\ndistressed that it should be<br />\n\"allied with a movement\u2014<br />\nfeminism\u2014that generally supports and encourages the legal<br />\ngenocide of defenseless human<br />\nbeings.\" I wish to answer his<br />\ncharges.<br />\nSuppose that we insisted that<br />\n<br />\nevery institution we give money<br />\nto should cease to finance, even<br />\nindirectly, those political activities which we oppose,<br />\nclaiming\u2014as Heym seems to<br />\nclaim\u2014that it otherwise<br />\nviolates our trust in its impartiality. I think that we should<br />\nthen end up, oddly enough,<br />\nwith a set of institutions completely partial to our own point<br />\nof view. And indeed Heym says<br />\nthat the University should cease<br />\nto finance, not necessarily those<br />\npolitical activities he happens to<br />\nsupport, but rather those that<br />\nhe or most other students happen to oppose.<br />\nIn fact, Heym probably<br />\nmeans that a University, which<br />\n<br />\nto know condemn any government (not just our own) that<br />\nsupports such genocide. But of<br />\ncourse Heym must be indiscreetly referring to the subject of abortion. Feminists and<br />\nother morally concerned people<br />\noppose the idea of outlawing all<br />\nabortions. Does that mean they<br />\nencourage the legal genocide of<br />\ndefenseless human beings? Far<br />\nfrom it. It means they do not<br />\nthink we are legally required to<br />\nrecognize the moral status of a<br />\nhuman embryo, which has<br />\nnone, just as we are not legally<br />\nrequired to recognize the moral<br />\nstatus of non-human embryos.<br />\nMichael Ginsborg<br />\n<br />\n\f10/APRIL 4, 1986<br />\n<br />\nSWEET THINGS<br />\nCoffee House Presents<br />\n<br />\nThe Magic of Coffee<br />\nIntroducing The New Gourmet Coffee Shoppe<br />\nSample FREE Gourmet Coffee<br />\nKenya AA Colombian Supremo<br />\nFeaturing The Magic of TOM YURASITES<br />\nTUESDAY, APRIL 8,1986<br />\n12:00-2:00 4:00-6:00<br />\nPlus FREE Recipes \u2022 Buttons \u2022 Bumper Stickers \u2022 Balloons!!<br />\nCOME GET YOUR COFFEE With Class<br />\nSweet Things Located in Levering Cafeteria<br />\nSponsored By Johns Hopkins Dining Services<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1986/87 HOUSING LOTTERY<br />\n1st CONTRACT SIGNING SESSIONS<br />\nDORM SOCIAL LOUNGE<br />\nWEDNESDAY, APRIL 9<br />\n6:00 P.M.-7:00 P.M.<br />\nWEDNESDAY, APRIL 9<br />\n7:00 P.M.<br />\n1 THURSDAY, APRIL 10<br />\n6:00 P.M.-7:00 P.M.<br />\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 10<br />\n7:00 P.M.<br />\n<br />\nGRADUATE SINGLE UNIT<br />\nGRADUATE SINGLE SPACE<br />\nUNDERGRADUATE SINGLE UNIT<br />\nUNDERGRADUATE SINGLE SP ACE<br />\nGRADUATE 2 PERSON<br />\nGRADUATE 3 PERSON<br />\nUNDERGRADUATE 2 PERSON<br />\nUNDERGRADUATE 3 PERSON<br />\nUNDERGRADUATE 4 PERSON<br />\n<br />\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, CONTACT THE HOUSING OFFICE, 338-790<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n.............. /<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/11<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\nA Doctor's Predicaments<br />\nWhen he had finished<br />\npresenting his talk on<br />\n\"Predicaments\" to a jammed<br />\nauditorium at the medical<br />\nschool last Monday evening,<br />\nDr. Oliver Sacks was asked,<br />\n\"do you have any suggestions<br />\non making medical school less<br />\ninsufferable than it is?\" The<br />\nquestioner was a young woman<br />\nin her twenties, clearly a<br />\nmedical student herself, and her<br />\nquestion brought a burst of<br />\nsympathetic\u2014and perhaps in<br />\nsome quarters uneasy\u2014<br />\nlaughter from the large<br />\naudience.<br />\nIt sounds like a pretty impertinent question to ask a rather<br />\nFamous neurologist, especially<br />\n<br />\nVouf- AND VA ttAufin<br />\nVonkit te anzisg<br />\n<br />\nJust think of the smoothtalking fox in La Fontaine's<br />\nfamous fable, where the<br />\nmessage seems to be: you might<br />\nignore the wiles of language,<br />\nbut language won't ignore you)<br />\nSacks obviously feels that it is<br />\nbetter to face language squarely, to consciously immerse<br />\nyourself in its labyrinth.<br />\nHis topic, as I mentioned,<br />\nwas \"Predicaments\", and not<br />\nsuprisingly, Sacks began by<br />\ntalking about his patient's<br />\npredicaments. For example, the<br />\ncase of the man who had suffered from a lifelong nervous<br />\ntic, a tic that had affected his<br />\nlife so much that he considered<br />\nit an essential part of his per-<br />\n<br />\npredicament of physicians<br />\nthemselves, who are now so<br />\nrarely equipped by their training to deal compassionately and<br />\nhumanely with the people they<br />\ntreat. And then, of course,<br />\nthere is the corresponding<br />\npredicament of the medical student (which had provoked the<br />\nquestion form the young<br />\nwoman), trained in a clinical<br />\nenvironment that no longer<br />\nseems to have very much to do<br />\nwith humane contact between<br />\ndoctor and patient, nor with the<br />\nstudent as someone with<br />\nspecific human needs (which<br />\nfor Sacks meant aesthetic or artistic needs). As Sacks himself<br />\nput it, the focus in medicine<br />\nnow is on the disease, rather<br />\nthan on the illness (the general<br />\neffects on the patient's own<br />\nlife).

In a sense, then, world. He agreed with the queshis liability was an asset.

Maybe the question is twice as awkward, since<br />\nit obviously belongs to that<br />\nwell-known \"have you stopped<br />\nbeating your wife?\" genre,just<br />\nthe kind of double bind that<br />\nmight be expected to place the<br />\ngood doctor himself in a real<br />\npredicament. Asking him a<br />\nquestion like that, in that context, is not unlike asking the<br />\nguest of honor at a banquet to<br />\ngive an after-dinner speech on<br />\nhis host's faults. Or so it would<br />\nseem.<br />\nIn fact, though, and as implausible as it might sound, the<br />\nquestion couldn't have been<br />\nmore appropriate. There's a<br />\nsimple explanation. Sacks, who<br />\nis professor of Neurology at the<br />\nAlbert Einstein College of<br />\nMedicine, was at the medical<br />\nschool as a guest speaker in the<br />\nNational Endowment for the<br />\nHumanities Spring Humanities<br />\nSeries, \"The Labyrinth of<br />\nLanguage: Meaning and<br />\nMetaphore in Medicine and<br />\nLiterature.\" With language and<br />\nnarrative playing such a key<br />\nrole in his own practice (he is<br />\nthe author of several volumes<br />\nof clinical case histories, which,<br />\njudging from the size of Monday's audience, have obviously given him a large public<br />\nfollowing), who could be better<br />\nqualified to discourse on<br />\n'language and medicine? Sacks<br />\nis an impassioned advocate of<br />\nthe humanities in general and<br />\nplaces great stress on narrative<br />\nas therapy in his own work. He<br />\nis obviously very skeptical of<br />\nany purely scientific medical<br />\ntraining which overlooks the<br />\ncentral fact that language<br />\nmediates all meaningful doctorpatient relations.<br />\nGiven the title of the series,<br />\nwith its reference to labyrinths,<br />\nit's not surprising that the<br />\nspeakers so far have tended to<br />\naddress the darker, as well as<br />\nthe lighter sides of language.<br />\nThe very word \"labyrinth\" carries its won suggestive mixture<br />\nof the positive and the negative.<br />\nA labyrinth can be a wonderful<br />\nthing and a terrible thing,<br />\n-delightfully sinuous, full of<br />\nadventure, ye! horribly dark<br />\ntoo, devious, and full of snares.<br />\n<br />\nQtA 5E,<br />\n<br />\n1E agN Re4vet415.<br />\n<br />\nThe recent hollow rhetoric of<br />\nthe Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica/GRO against the College Republicans' and others'<br />\npositions against divestment<br />\nhas forced me to make another<br />\nattempt to clear the ever present<br />\nsmoke screen surrounding the<br />\ndivestment issue. There are<br />\nthree main points that I feel<br />\nmust be addressed.<br />\nThe first diversionary tactic<br />\nused by the Coalition/GRO is<br />\ntheir continuing accusations<br />\nthat the College Republicans<br />\nhave systematically covered up<br />\npro-divestment literature. The<br />\nCoalition's blatant violations of<br />\nthe Student Council/Administration postering policy by<br />\npostering every non-moving<br />\nvertical object has brought the<br />\ninevitable enforcement by proper authorities, which they<br />\nblame on the College<br />\nRepublicans. This is to be contrasted by the legally posted<br />\nliterature of the College<br />\nRepublicans, which appears to<br />\nhave been repeatedly and<br />\nsystematically<br />\ndestroyed<br />\naround campus during the holiday weekend before the Student<br />\nCouncil Referendum. It was so<br />\n<br />\nbad in some areas, like McCoy<br />\nHall, that hourly repostering<br />\nwas necessary until the day of<br />\nthe Referendum.<br />\nThe Coalition's second tactic<br />\nis the incessant stereotyping of<br />\ntheir opposition as racist and<br />\nreactionary. This is the same<br />\ngroup which refers to the<br />\n\"spear-throwing Inkatha army\" and some people who oppose apartheid because \"they<br />\nare black, after all.\" It is this<br />\nstereotyping which has caused<br />\nsuch historical events as<br />\nMcCarthyism<br />\nand<br />\nthe<br />\nHolocaust. I hope that the<br />\nCoalition/GRO does not actually see the world in such<br />\nblack and white terms.<br />\nThe final point which needs<br />\nto be addressed is the incessant<br />\nstream of misleading and<br />\nsuperfluous<br />\ninformation<br />\npresented in Coalition/GRO<br />\nliterature. This includes the<br />\nCoalition's action against<br />\nUNITA, an organization<br />\nfighting against Marxist<br />\nAngola. This Marxist regime<br />\ndoes not impose apartheid, but<br />\nis guilty of far greater human<br />\nrights<br />\nviolations,<br />\nas<br />\ndocumented by Amnesty International.

The one person<br />\nwho has made this possible is<br />\nWickwire. I hold him in high<br />\nesteem both because he has<br />\nbeen for decades a distinguished member of the JHU community and also because of his<br />\nextraordinary knowledge of<br />\nnonviolent activities in Central<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nOn the specific subject of<br />\nnonviolent action in Central<br />\nAmerica, I know of no one in<br />\nthe New York area with his intimate knowledge, and so I<br />\nhave sent students from my<br />\nclasses in nonviolence here to<br />\nconsult with him at JHU. He<br />\ngives of his time and knowledge<br />\nto them as generously as he<br />\ndoes to me, and they have<br />\nreturned immensely enriched by<br />\nhis learning.<br />\nIn view of this, the attacks in<br />\nthese two letters on Wickwire<br />\nare as mystifying as they are appalling. Menetrez concludes<br />\nthat \"...if you want to learn<br />\nabout nonviolence...you<br />\nwon't learn anything from<br />\nWickwire,\" while Beckner indulges in scathing ad hominem<br />\ninvective, e.g., \"a self-righteous<br />\nliberal zealot.\" What can be the<br />\nreason for this? When I put<br />\nthat question to members of<br />\nWickwire's, class on Feb. 14,<br />\nthey were baffled also, but they<br />\ncould not recall a single precedent in your columns or<br />\nelsewhere for this sort of personal attack by students on<br />\nJHU teachers. I would like to<br />\nput this question now to you, as<br />\neditor of the News-Letter, and<br />\nif there is not, then do you<br />\nbelieve that this is a good precedent to set?<br />\nWe do have, of course, a<br />\ndramatic precedent for this sort<br />\nof liberal bashing, and especially its ad hominem style, in the<br />\nrecent history of Columbia<br />\nUniversity. In 1968, SDS leader<br />\nMark Rudd made a practice of<br />\nattacking liberals, although<br />\nfrom presumably a different<br />\npolitical perspective than these<br />\ntwo JHU students. Whatever<br />\nthe political position, though,<br />\nat the core of this attitude is<br />\nwhat Gandhi called a \"violence<br />\nof the spirit.\" He believed,<br />\nquite rightly, that this variety of<br />\nviolence is sometimes more corrupting and deadly than<br />\nphysical violence. We in<br />\nacademia need to consider this<br />\ncarefully because the kind of<br />\ncommunity that we inhabit<br />\nrelies heavily on the sort of<br />\ncivility that Wickwire unfailingly personifies.<br />\n<br />\nI am pleased to see that your<br />\npublication of students' letters<br />\non Chester Wickwire's course<br />\nNonviolent Action as a Means<br />\nof Conflict Resolution now includes a statement of truth.<br />\nSteven Lessoff's letter in the<br />\nFeb. 21 News-Letter describes<br />\naccurately the course that I<br />\nhave had the priviledge to address each year since its<br />\ninception.<br />\nThe opening two letters by<br />\nFrank Menentrez and C.<br />\nFredrick Beckner 111 portray a<br />\ncourse and an instructor that<br />\nare entirely unrecognizable to<br />\nme. Both students comment<br />\nspecifically on the poor quality<br />\nof most of the guest speakers.<br />\nBeckner states that \" .no<br />\nspeaker seemed to have been informed that the supposed focus<br />\nof the class was the effectiveness and desirability of nonviolence as a political<br />\nphenomenon.\" Not only was<br />\nthis the main focus of my lecture on Gandhi's nonviolence,<br />\nbut the class that encountered<br />\neach year had consistently been<br />\nprepared by having viewed<br />\nfilms on Gandhi beforehand.<br />\nBeckner complains further<br />\nthat \"there were no discussions<br />\nat all\" among these \"random<br />\nlectures.\" Again, this is false.<br />\nAmong hundreds of university<br />\nclasses that I have taught on the<br />\nspecific subject of Gandhi's<br />\nnonviolence to students in<br />\nEngland, India and America,<br />\nthe classes that I taught each<br />\nyear at JHU were certainly<br />\ncomparable in quality to the<br />\nbest that I have addressed<br />\nelsewhere, and our extensive<br />\ndiscussions that were a part of<br />\nevery lecture were marked by<br />\nboth enthusiasm and intelligence. For example when 1<br />\nspoke to Wickwire's class on<br />\nFeb. 14 of this year, two of the<br />\nstudents planned to spend this<br />\nsummer in India (where one<br />\nhad relatives), and were<br />\nespecially well informed about<br />\nwhat might be encountered in<br />\nGandhi's home state of Gujarat; we spent a half hour after<br />\nclass in discussion of Gandhi's<br />\nlegacy to India.<br />\nDennis Dalton<br />\nAnother student pressed me<br />\nclass<br />\nhard in discussion during<br />\nabout parallels that I had The writer is Professor of<br />\ndrawn between Gandhi's and Political Science at Barnard<br />\nKing's styles of leadership, College.<br />\n<br />\nBUY AN AL PACKER YUGO<br />\nFOR JUST $89 A MONTH!<br />\nNo money down to qualified buyers<br />\n<br />\n201N<br />\n<br />\nMIN<br />\n<br />\nSTOCK!<br />\n<br />\n$3<br />\n990<br />\njr<br />\nONLY<br />\n<br />\nMfg.

First, the Coali-<br />\n<br />\ntion claims that Inkatha is<br />\nmerely a \"Zulu group\" and is<br />\n\"self-defined according to<br />\ntribe.\" This statement is completely false. On September 19,<br />\n1977, Buthelezi was summoned<br />\nto Pretoria by the government's<br />\nminister of justice, who<br />\nthreatened to arrest Buthelezi<br />\nand take action against Inkatha<br />\nprecisely because Inkatha was<br />\nnot limiting its membership to<br />\nZulus.

In addition to making<br />\nample use of unsubtle innuendo and racial slurs against the<br />\nZulu people, the Coalition has<br />\ngrossly misrepresented Inkatha's stance in South African<br />\npolitics.

As anyone who has<br />\nseen the news from South<br />\nAfrica can testify, the military<br />\nforces of apartheid are in fact<br />\nbecoming more repressive as<br />\npetty laws are revoked merely<br />\nfor window-dressing purposes.<br />\nNo U.S. observer can have the<br />\naudacity to honestly believe<br />\nthat apartheid is crumbling<br />\nwhen eighty black protesters<br />\n<br />\nwere killed last week alone. As<br />\nfor the tactics of the ANC, that<br />\norganization fought apartheid<br />\nthrough nonviolent resistance<br />\nfrom 1912 to 1960, when 69<br />\nblacks were shot in their backs<br />\nat Sharpeville for burning<br />\npasses (mandatory IDs for<br />\nAfricans). The current ANC<br />\nguerrilla strategy reflects a<br />\nrealistic perception of the need<br />\nin South Africa both for selfdefense and for pressure from<br />\nall fronts, but it is only one part<br />\nof the liberation struggle. The<br />\ndivestment and economic sanctions movement is another part,<br />\none which has been endorsed by<br />\nthe ANC and 77 percent of the<br />\nblack population (Gallup/London Times poll, August 1985).<br />\nOf course, Gatsha Buthelezi<br />\nopposes divestment.<br />\nButhelezi's argument is that<br />\ndivetment will cost jobs.<br />\n(Students for Inkatha argue absurdly that divestment will<br />\n\"destroy millions of jobs for<br />\nblack South Africans\" even<br />\nthough U.S. companies<br />\noperating in S.A. only employ<br />\n60,000 blacks!) We concur that<br />\npressure against apartheid in<br />\nany effective form will be painful both to blacks and whites,<br />\nin that in any transition from<br />\nminority to majority rule,<br />\ndisruptions will occur. The key<br />\nquestion is, do the majority of<br />\nthe people who will be affected<br />\nwant such pressure. The clear<br />\nanswer is yes. Buthelezi is merely playing a diversionary role by<br />\nopposing divestment.<br />\nIn conclusion, we sincerely<br />\n<br />\nBishop<br />\nDESMOND M.

Witty School For Wives<br />\nby Jason M. Hanson<br />\nMoliere was far from being<br />\na conservative seventeenth century playwright. When his<br />\nfourth successful play The<br />\nSchool for Wives, opened in<br />\n1662, a rage of controversy ensued in the literary circles of<br />\nParis that would move provincial critics to go so far as to<br />\nstage The Critique of The<br />\nSchool of Wives.

The<br />\ngreat similarity between the<br />\nsymptoms of PCP intoxication<br />\nand schizophrenia suggested<br />\nthat there may be receptors in<br />\nthe brain for PCP or other<br />\nrelated compounds which are<br />\nsomehow connected with abnormal receptors involved in<br />\nschizophrenia. This idea led to<br />\n<br />\na search for these receptors by<br />\nseveral research groups, including the NIH. Several<br />\npapers on PCP and related<br />\nreceptors in the brain have<br />\nalready been published.<br />\nO'Donohue has found<br />\nrecently that the locations of<br />\nthe PCP receptors in the brain<br />\nare consistent with the<br />\npsychological effects of PCP.<br />\nUsing radioactive PCP on rats,<br />\nautoradiogram slides showed<br />\nthe two main areas of the brain<br />\nto which PCP binds in large<br />\namounts.

Around<br />\n1977, however, it was<br />\ndiscovered that there were PCP<br />\nreceptors in the brain, separate<br />\nfrom the sigma-opiate receptors. The PCP receptor can also<br />\nbind related drugs, such as<br />\nketamine.

The<br />\nplay started at midfield, where<br />\n<br />\nDel Dressel picked up a ground<br />\nball and charged towards the<br />\nnet. He dished off to Wood<br />\nnear the crease, and the junior<br />\ncalmly faked goalie Pete<br />\nSheehan into coming out of the<br />\ncage before firing home the<br />\ngame-winner.<br />\nThe Jays still had a seeming<br />\neternity to protect their slim<br />\nlead, but the defense held as<br />\nthey had been doing all day.<br />\nWith only 10 seconds to play.<br />\n<br />\nLacrosse Roundup<br />\nTeam<br />\nMaryland (6-0)<br />\n<br />\nRecent Results<br />\nBeat N.

Morrill tallied three<br />\ngoals, all on feeds from Wood,<br />\nand added an assist. AllAmerica's Dressel and Craig<br />\nBubier also recorded a goal and<br />\nassist each to aid the cause.<br />\nThe real heroes on this day,<br />\nthough, were the defensive<br />\nplayers. The close defense,<br />\nholstered by the return of cocaptain John DeTommaso,<br />\nwere faced with the unenviable<br />\ntask of shutting down<br />\nVirginia's high-powered attack<br />\nunit that features superstars<br />\nJeff Nicklas and Roddy<br />\nMarino. Nicklas nailed two<br />\ngoais, but Marino, who had 12<br />\ngoing into the game,came away<br />\nwith none, and just one assist.<br />\nFor the Wahoos, it prolonged their streak of frustration<br />\nagainst Hopkins as they fell to<br />\nthe Jays for the tenth straight<br />\ntime and dropped to 3-2 for the<br />\nseason. Many of the losses, like<br />\nSaturday's were near misses,<br />\nmost notably 1985's playoff<br />\ncollapse. Virginia raced out to<br />\na 5-0 lead at Homewood Field,<br />\nbut then could barely hold a<br />\nlead into halftime. Hopkins<br />\ntrailed 6-5, and then went on to<br />\nwin 11-8.<br />\nLast weekend, the game once<br />\nagain could've gone either way.<br />\nIt was tied on five different occasions, and neither squad<br />\ncould hold more than a two<br />\ngoal edge at any time. The<br />\n'Hoos jumped out to 4-2 lead<br />\nearly in the second quarter,<br />\nbefore Hopkins exploded for<br />\nwhat would become four<br />\nunanswered goals. At the 3:38<br />\n<br />\nmark, Jack Crawford dealt a<br />\nperfect pass to Bubier in front<br />\nof the net, and the junior<br />\ncranked it home past Sheehan.<br />\nWithin a minute and a half, the<br />\nJays tallied again to tie it up at<br />\nfour. This time it was Morrill as<br />\nhe took a pass from Wood on<br />\nthe left side 10 yards out and<br />\nfired one in just inside the left<br />\npost. A goal by Crawford<br />\nbefore intermission gave<br />\nHopkins a 5-4 lead that they<br />\nwould never relinquish.<br />\nEarly in the second half, the<br />\nJays would add one more<br />\nbefore the 'Hoos woke up. At<br />\n2:22, Dressel scored on an assist<br />\nfrom Morrill and it was 6-4 and<br />\nit looked like the rout may be<br />\non. Unfortunately, Virginia<br />\nrefused to cave in, and fought<br />\nback to tie it up. First, Reda<br />\nand then Nicklas scored and<br />\n<br />\nsuddenly it was knotted up<br />\nagain. Before the 3rd period<br />\nwould close, Hopkins managed<br />\nto take the lead back, this time<br />\nfrom the oddest of contributors. Long-stick middie<br />\nBrad McLam fed fellow rope<br />\nman Steve Mitchell for the<br />\nunusual score with only ten<br />\nseconds to go.<br />\nVirginia bounced right back<br />\nand tied it a final time on a Will<br />\nRosebro goal five minutes into<br />\nthe final period. Eight minutes<br />\nlater, Wood would score and,<br />\nfinally, Hopkins escaped Scott<br />\nStadium with the big win over<br />\na team that ranked as high as<br />\nthird early in the season<br />\nIn between the Syracuse loss<br />\nand the Virginia win, Hopkins<br />\ntook three other games rather<br />\nContinued on rage a<br />\n<br />\nLaxers Set To Host Heels<br />\nWhen the North Carolina<br />\nTar Heels invade Homewood<br />\nField tomorrow at 2 p.m., fans<br />\nwill be treated to the resumption of what has become the<br />\nmost heated and evenlymatched rivalry in college<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nThe schools have met only<br />\nnine times, but seven have been<br />\nin the last four years and incredibly, all but one has been<br />\ndecided by one goal. Most<br />\ntimes, that goal has come in the<br />\nwaning moments of the contest.<br />\nAll told, Carolina, coached<br />\nby former Blue Jay Willie<br />\nScroggs, holds a 5-4 edge over<br />\nHopkins. The Heels won last<br />\nyear's contest 11-10 on a last second goal, thus avenging two<br />\n.1984 losses to the Jays, by<br />\nscores of 14-12 and 4-3.<br />\nLook for tomorrow's game<br />\nto be just as exciting. Though<br />\nneither team is number 1 at the<br />\nmoment, the battle will be the<br />\n<br />\nmost significant one that these<br />\ntwo teams have waged in a<br />\nregular season game. The winner will likely move back into<br />\nthe second seed by tournament<br />\nLime. The loser drops to the<br />\nfifth spot in the polls, barring<br />\na big upset anywhere else.<br />\nShould the losing team not rise<br />\nback into the first four spots,<br />\nthen they will be ineligible for<br />\na home playoff game.<br />\nA loss by Hopkins would be<br />\nserious, but not deadly. The<br />\nJays still play Maryland and<br />\nNavy, and should they take<br />\nboth games they would certainly move up to at least fourth,<br />\nwhich means they'll play at<br />\nhome in the post-season. If<br />\nCarolina loses, though, it could<br />\nwreck their season. They, like<br />\nHopkins, play four more times,<br />\nbut all are at home and none<br />\nagainst any of the other teams<br />\nahead of them. This all means<br />\nthat even if the Heels sweep<br />\n<br />\ntheir last four, they need some<br />\nhelp from other teams in order<br />\nto move back up.<br />\nGoing into the game, the<br />\nteams seem to be headed in opposite directions. The Jays<br />\nstarted the season slowly, losing to Syracuse then struggling<br />\nwith Hobart. Now, they're on<br />\na roll, having won 4 straight including an 8-7 victory ever<br />\nVirginia in Charlottesville last<br />\nweek. Carolina, on the other<br />\nhand is struggling a bit and<br />\ncoming off a demoralizing 10-9<br />\nloss to Maryland.

Absolutely<br />\nunheard of. Next thing you know premeds really will be well-rounded.<br />\nAfter all, good ol' John Hopkin simply isn't\u2014ever\u2014 ranked that low. We<br />\ncould take second, maybe even third.<br />\nFourth place alone might be palatable,<br />\nbut a tie with\u2014of all people\u2014Navy?<br />\nYuck!<br />\nSo how did this horrid situation come<br />\nabout? Well, it seems the fine gentlemen<br />\nwho vote in the poll wanted to stick it<br />\n(sorry) to Hopkins. How else does one<br />\nexplain the oddities in this week's voting?<br />\n\u2022 For example, the Midshipmen are the<br />\nequals of the Blue Jays? Nonsense.<br />\nGranted their record is 7-0, but their<br />\nschedule has been, at best, mediocre.<br />\nThey have beaten some good (not great)<br />\nteams\u2014Penn, UMBC and Rutgers come<br />\nto mind\u2014but they have yet to play a truly first-rate club.(That will change Saturday when they take on Army.)<br />\nAnother case of mysterious voting:<br />\nMaryland, by beating North Carolina,<br />\njumps clear over Syracuse and Hopkins.<br />\nThe Tar Heels were, of course, number<br />\none and undefeated. And they were playing at home, where they are notoriously<br />\ntough to beat. Still, they were the first<br />\ngood team Maryland has played. (The<br />\nTerrapins' first five games were jokes<br />\nagainst the likes of Boston College and<br />\nOhio Wesleyan.) They surely haven't<br />\nproven themselves to be the best team in<br />\nthe country.<br /><br />\nSo herewith, our own (rational) poll:<br />\n1) Syracuse. 2) Hopkins. 3) Maryland.<br />\n4) Carolina. The Orangemen clearly<br />\ndeserved to be number one after last<br />\nweek. They were number two going into the weekend, whipped a respectable<br />\nteam (Adelphi, 19-9) and number one<br />\nlost. They have also beaten the Blue<br />\nJays, the team that was number three.<br />\nSpeaking of the Jays, they should have<br />\nbeen number two, having lost only to<br />\nSyracuse and having beaten a good team<br />\n(Virginia) with a clutch fourth quarter<br />\ngoal (Dressel to Wood on a beauty) on<br />\nSaturday. The Terps are a legitimate<br />\nnumber three (they're undefeated and<br />\ndid, after all, beat Carolina), and the Tar<br />\nHeels certainly shouldn't drop below number four.<br />\nThe real problem is that should the<br />\nJays\u2014pardon the obscenity\u2014lose to<br />\nCarolina on Saturday (a real possibility),<br />\nthey would be dangerously close to losing the home-field advantage for the<br />\nquarter-finals. Can you imagine?\u2014not<br />\na single play-off game at Homewood.<br />\nThe world would stop.<br />\nThe solution to all this is obvious.<br />\nEverybody should go to the game Saturday (since it's the first home contest since<br />\nMarch 8 y'all ought to be ready for<br />\nlacrosse), and be even louder than<br />\nnormal.<br />\nOh and one last thing\u2014far too few of<br />\nyou took our advice at the Syracuse game<br />\nto turn around, wave frantically and yell<br />\n\"Hi, Stevie!\" So come on, guys. This is<br />\nyour last chance.<br /><br />\nSpanking the HOP<br />\nMary Ellen Porter seems to be getting<br />\ninto the maternal spirit\u2014she's learning<br />\nto spank her own child. No, silly, we<br />\ndon't mean the actual kid, we mean the<br />\nHOP.<br />\nWell, okay, the HOP may not exactly<br />\nbe Porter's creature, but she is on its<br />\nboard, and it is at least as much an arm<br />\nof the administration as of the Student<br />\nCouncil. So when Porter suspended the<br />\nHOP for alcohol violations the other<br />\nday, it was far different than suspending<br />\na frat.<br />\nTo review a bit, the HOP was barred<br />\nfor one month from serving alcohol at<br />\nits functions. Since all campus social<br />\nevents must now be coordinated through<br />\nthe HOP, that actually means that<br />\nalcohol won't be served at any campus<br />\nevent. Furthermore, two IDs will be required at future events from everyone<br />\nwho wants to purchase alcohol.<br />\nThe thing that makes all of this a littie strange (and in some ways heartening) is that the HOP is in part an administration body. Both Porter and<br />\nDirector of Residential Life Andrea<br />\nPerry serve on its Board. While that may<br />\nnot seem like much at first glance, it is<br />\nfar more significant a role for the administration than existed under the<br />\nHOP's predecessor, the Social<br />\nCommittee.<br /><br />\nIndeed, that was one of the rationales<br />\nbehind the HOP's founding. It was<br />\ncreated, the old fogies will remember,<br />\nalmost two years ago. At the time, incoming Student Council President Jon<br />\nLana (along with a lot of other people)<br />\nthought the social programming structure for the campus needed an overhaul.<br />\nThe result was the HOP, which swallowed up a couple of smaller committees and<br />\ntook on the role of master schedulemaker for Homewood.<br />\nIt operated informally for about half<br />\nyear,<br />\nand then was offered (over, oddly<br />\na<br />\nenough, Porter's strong objections) to<br />\nthe student body for approval in a<br />\nreferendum. It passed overwhelmingly (it<br />\nwas hardly the most controversial vote<br />\nin the history of the school), and the<br />\nHOP was officially born.<br />\nSo a fair number of people were more<br />\nthan a little surprised when Porter<br />\nsuspended the HOP. Actually, though,<br />\nit's sort of refreshing. At least occasionally, it seems, the administration can<br />\nact fairly impartially, in this case almost<br />\nsuspending a part of itself. Indeed, the<br />\nevent for which the HOP got in trouble<br />\nwas a dance played by the Crusty<br />\nNostrils, a group that includes. . .Porter.<br />\nStill, considering the administration's<br />\ntrack record, this is a surprising (and<br />\npleasant) case of fairness.<br /><br />\nThe most grotesque thing Let us now dispel a popular<br />\naround here is Joe Chen's ig- Homewood myth: the council<br />\nnorance regarding many cam- and its committees are not<br />\npus affairs.

Furthermore, every committee<br />\nmember wields a healthy chunk<br />\nof the decision-making power,<br />\nand thus does have a say in how<br />\nthings should be run.<br />\nChen's other fables are<br />\nequally erroneous. I do not<br />\nclaim that there are no problems; in fact, Chen's tirade<br />\nmay actually yield some good.<br /><br />\nstudents.\" How can we hear<br />\nwhat's not being said?<br />\nFinally, Chen has the audacity to claim that \"... it [the<br />\ncouncil] has done more to abet<br />\nthan to stop the rampant<br />\nphenomena<br />\nof student<br />\napathy.\" This \"let's-sitaround-and-bitch -withoutactually-doing-anything\" attitude is far more harmful than<br />\nanything council's done.

He accused that organization of being inevitably \"left of the leftof-center.\" And he was<br />\ndistressed that it should be<br />\n\"allied with a movement\u2014<br />\nfeminism\u2014that generally supports and encourages the legal<br />\ngenocide of defenseless human<br />\nbeings.\" I wish to answer his<br />\ncharges.<br />\nSuppose that we insisted that<br /><br />\nevery institution we give money<br />\nto should cease to finance, even<br />\nindirectly, those political activities which we oppose,<br />\nclaiming\u2014as Heym seems to<br />\nclaim\u2014that it otherwise<br />\nviolates our trust in its impartiality. I think that we should<br />\nthen end up, oddly enough,<br />\nwith a set of institutions completely partial to our own point<br />\nof view. And indeed Heym says<br />\nthat the University should cease<br />\nto finance, not necessarily those<br />\npolitical activities he happens to<br />\nsupport, but rather those that<br />\nhe or most other students happen to oppose.<br />\nIn fact, Heym probably<br />\nmeans that a University, which<br /><br />\nto know condemn any government (not just our own) that<br />\nsupports such genocide. But of<br />\ncourse Heym must be indiscreetly referring to the subject of abortion. Feminists and<br />\nother morally concerned people<br />\noppose the idea of outlawing all<br />\nabortions. Does that mean they<br />\nencourage the legal genocide of<br />\ndefenseless human beings? Far<br />\nfrom it.

For example, the<br />\ncase of the man who had suffered from a lifelong nervous<br />\ntic, a tic that had affected his<br />\nlife so much that he considered<br />\nit an essential part of his per-<br /><br />\npredicament of physicians<br />\nthemselves, who are now so<br />\nrarely equipped by their training to deal compassionately and<br />\nhumanely with the people they<br />\ntreat. And then, of course,<br />\nthere is the corresponding<br />\npredicament of the medical student (which had provoked the<br />\nquestion form the young<br />\nwoman), trained in a clinical<br />\nenvironment that no longer<br />\nseems to have very much to do<br />\nwith humane contact between<br />\ndoctor and patient, nor with the<br />\nstudent as someone with<br />\nspecific human needs (which<br />\nfor Sacks meant aesthetic or artistic needs). As Sacks himself<br />\nput it, the focus in medicine<br />\nnow is on the disease, rather<br />\nthan on the illness (the general<br />\neffects on the patient's own<br />\nlife). Which brings me back to<br />\nthe original question dealing<br />\nsonality.<br />\nHis predicament? There was with the insufferability of<br />\na drug available to treat his medical school, for this quesspecific neurological disorder, tion actually made medicine<br />\nyet he wasn't sure he wanted to itself sound like an illness, if<br />\nbe cured: his tic was so much not a disease.<br />\nFar from being flustered by<br />\npart of what he thought of as<br />\n\"himself,\" that he was truly the question, Sacks took it as<br />\nafraid he wouldn't be able to the most natural one in the<br />\nlive without it. In a sense, then, world. He agreed with the queshis liability was an asset. Take tioner's premises and willingly<br />\naway my tic, he thought, and confessed (and I think there<br />\nyou take away my wit. His tic was a hint of boasting in it as<br />\nwas like a broken leg that is at well) that he too had found<br />\nthe same time a crutch. A medical school insufferable and<br />\nhad longed for it to be over and<br />\nlabryinthine predicament.<br />\nIn order to treat him, Sacks, done with. His personal soluin concerted dialogue with his tion to the problem, as a stupatient, then had to \"invent\" dent at Oxford, was to<br />\na narrative of the man's future. prescribe for himself large<br />\nLikening the process to the one doses of philosophy, and as<br />\nfound in Freud's case histories, many music, fine art, literature,<br />\nSacks said he had to dig deeper natural history, and preand deeper (Freud himself used modern, pre-scientific medical<br />\nthe metaphor of archaeology) books as he could consume.<br />\nSack's \"message\" was loud<br />\nin order to find a layer of his<br />\nclear: to treat disease, you<br />\nand<br />\npatient's self that wasn't depencan hardly dispense with hard<br />\ndent on the tic.<br />\nAfter he'd been speaking for science. But to treat a person's<br />\na while, though, it became clear illness\u2014to truly be a<br />\nthat the main \"predicament\" physician\u2014you simply can't afSacks had in mind was the ford to ignore the humanities.<br /><br />\nColiege Pre:, Seneca<br /><br />\nei41134<br /><br />\nHollow Rhetoric<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\ngreg sims<br />\nwhen he's been invited to the<br />\nHopkins Medical School as a<br />\nguest speaker. Maybe the question is twice as awkward, since<br />\nit obviously belongs to that<br />\nwell-known \"have you stopped<br />\nbeating your wife?\" genre,just<br />\nthe kind of double bind that<br />\nmight be expected to place the<br />\ngood doctor himself in a real<br />\npredicament. Asking him a<br />\nquestion like that, in that context, is not unlike asking the<br />\nguest of honor at a banquet to<br />\ngive an after-dinner speech on<br />\nhis host's faults. Or so it would<br />\nseem.<br />\nIn fact, though, and as implausible as it might sound, the<br />\nquestion couldn't have been<br />\nmore appropriate. There's a<br />\nsimple explanation. Sacks, who<br />\nis professor of Neurology at the<br />\nAlbert Einstein College of<br />\nMedicine, was at the medical<br />\nschool as a guest speaker in the<br />\nNational Endowment for the<br />\nHumanities Spring Humanities<br />\nSeries, \"The Labyrinth of<br />\nLanguage: Meaning and<br />\nMetaphore in Medicine and<br />\nLiterature.\" With language and<br />\nnarrative playing such a key<br />\nrole in his own practice (he is<br />\nthe author of several volumes<br />\nof clinical case histories, which,<br />\njudging from the size of Monday's audience, have obviously given him a large public<br />\nfollowing), who could be better<br />\nqualified to discourse on<br />\n'language and medicine? Sacks<br />\nis an impassioned advocate of<br />\nthe humanities in general and<br />\nplaces great stress on narrative<br />\nas therapy in his own work. He<br />\nis obviously very skeptical of<br />\nany purely scientific medical<br />\ntraining which overlooks the<br />\ncentral fact that language<br />\nmediates all meaningful doctorpatient relations.<br />\nGiven the title of the series,<br />\nwith its reference to labyrinths,<br />\nit's not surprising that the<br />\nspeakers so far have tended to<br />\naddress the darker, as well as<br />\nthe lighter sides of language.<br />\nThe very word \"labyrinth\" carries its won suggestive mixture<br />\nof the positive and the negative.<br />\nA labyrinth can be a wonderful<br />\nthing and a terrible thing,<br />\n-delightfully sinuous, full of<br />\nadventure, ye! horribly dark<br />\ntoo, devious, and full of snares.<br /><br />\nQtA 5E,<br /><br />\n1E agN Re4vet415.<br /><br />\nThe recent hollow rhetoric of<br />\nthe Coalition for a Free South<br />\nAfrica/GRO against the College Republicans' and others'<br />\npositions against divestment<br />\nhas forced me to make another<br />\nattempt to clear the ever present<br />\nsmoke screen surrounding the<br />\ndivestment issue. There are<br />\nthree main points that I feel<br />\nmust be addressed.<br />\nThe first diversionary tactic<br />\nused by the Coalition/GRO is<br />\ntheir continuing accusations<br />\nthat the College Republicans<br />\nhave systematically covered up<br />\npro-divestment literature. The<br />\nCoalition's blatant violations of<br />\nthe Student Council/Administration postering policy by<br />\npostering every non-moving<br />\nvertical object has brought the<br />\ninevitable enforcement by proper authorities, which they<br />\nblame on the College<br />\nRepublicans. This is to be contrasted by the legally posted<br />\nliterature of the College<br />\nRepublicans, which appears to<br />\nhave been repeatedly and<br />\nsystematically<br />\ndestroyed<br />\naround campus during the holiday weekend before the Student<br />\nCouncil Referendum. It was so<br /><br />\nbad in some areas, like McCoy<br />\nHall, that hourly repostering<br />\nwas necessary until the day of<br />\nthe Referendum.<br />\nThe Coalition's second tactic<br />\nis the incessant stereotyping of<br />\ntheir opposition as racist and<br />\nreactionary. This is the same<br />\ngroup which refers to the<br />\n\"spear-throwing Inkatha army\" and some people who oppose apartheid because \"they<br />\nare black, after all.\" It is this<br />\nstereotyping which has caused<br />\nsuch historical events as<br />\nMcCarthyism<br />\nand<br />\nthe<br />\nHolocaust. I hope that the<br />\nCoalition/GRO does not actually see the world in such<br />\nblack and white terms.<br />\nThe final point which needs<br />\nto be addressed is the incessant<br />\nstream of misleading and<br />\nsuperfluous<br />\ninformation<br />\npresented in Coalition/GRO<br />\nliterature. This includes the<br />\nCoalition's action against<br />\nUNITA, an organization<br />\nfighting against Marxist<br />\nAngola. This Marxist regime<br />\ndoes not impose apartheid, but<br />\nis guilty of far greater human<br />\nrights<br />\nviolations,<br />\nas<br />\ndocumented by Amnesty International.

The one person<br />\nwho has made this possible is<br />\nWickwire. I hold him in high<br />\nesteem both because he has<br />\nbeen for decades a distinguished member of the JHU community and also because of his<br />\nextraordinary knowledge of<br />\nnonviolent activities in Central<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nOn the specific subject of<br />\nnonviolent action in Central<br />\nAmerica, I know of no one in<br />\nthe New York area with his intimate knowledge, and so I<br />\nhave sent students from my<br />\nclasses in nonviolence here to<br />\nconsult with him at JHU. He<br />\ngives of his time and knowledge<br />\nto them as generously as he<br />\ndoes to me, and they have<br />\nreturned immensely enriched by<br />\nhis learning.<br />\nIn view of this, the attacks in<br />\nthese two letters on Wickwire<br />\nare as mystifying as they are appalling. Menetrez concludes<br />\nthat \"...if you want to learn<br />\nabout nonviolence...you<br />\nwon't learn anything from<br />\nWickwire,\" while Beckner indulges in scathing ad hominem<br />\ninvective, e.g., \"a self-righteous<br />\nliberal zealot.\" What can be the<br />\nreason for this? When I put<br />\nthat question to members of<br />\nWickwire's, class on Feb. 14,<br />\nthey were baffled also, but they<br />\ncould not recall a single precedent in your columns or<br />\nelsewhere for this sort of personal attack by students on<br />\nJHU teachers. I would like to<br />\nput this question now to you, as<br />\neditor of the News-Letter, and<br />\nif there is not, then do you<br />\nbelieve that this is a good precedent to set?<br />\nWe do have, of course, a<br />\ndramatic precedent for this sort<br />\nof liberal bashing, and especially its ad hominem style, in the<br />\nrecent history of Columbia<br />\nUniversity. In 1968, SDS leader<br />\nMark Rudd made a practice of<br />\nattacking liberals, although<br />\nfrom presumably a different<br />\npolitical perspective than these<br />\ntwo JHU students. Whatever<br />\nthe political position, though,<br />\nat the core of this attitude is<br />\nwhat Gandhi called a \"violence<br />\nof the spirit.\" He believed,<br />\nquite rightly, that this variety of<br />\nviolence is sometimes more corrupting and deadly than<br />\nphysical violence. We in<br />\nacademia need to consider this<br />\ncarefully because the kind of<br />\ncommunity that we inhabit<br />\nrelies heavily on the sort of<br />\ncivility that Wickwire unfailingly personifies.<br /><br />\nI am pleased to see that your<br />\npublication of students' letters<br />\non Chester Wickwire's course<br />\nNonviolent Action as a Means<br />\nof Conflict Resolution now includes a statement of truth.<br />\nSteven Lessoff's letter in the<br />\nFeb. 21 News-Letter describes<br />\naccurately the course that I<br />\nhave had the priviledge to address each year since its<br />\ninception.<br />\nThe opening two letters by<br />\nFrank Menentrez and C.<br />\nFredrick Beckner 111 portray a<br />\ncourse and an instructor that<br />\nare entirely unrecognizable to<br />\nme.

First, the Coali-<br /><br />\ntion claims that Inkatha is<br />\nmerely a \"Zulu group\" and is<br />\n\"self-defined according to<br />\ntribe.\" This statement is completely false. On September 19,<br />\n1977, Buthelezi was summoned<br />\nto Pretoria by the government's<br />\nminister of justice, who<br />\nthreatened to arrest Buthelezi<br />\nand take action against Inkatha<br />\nprecisely because Inkatha was<br />\nnot limiting its membership to<br />\nZulus.

Codewords such as \"spearthrowing\" and \"tribalistic\" are<br />\nas insulting to Black South<br />\nAfricans as \"nigger\" or<br />\n\"kaffir.\"<br />\nThe Coalition, which could<br />\nhave played a constructive role<br />\nin the struggle to abolish apartheid, has instead chosen to<br />\nserve as a propaganda organ<br />\nfor the ANC. Its crude polemic<br />\nagainst Inkatha is long on<br />\nvituperative rhetoric and short<br />\non facts. In addition to making<br />\nample use of unsubtle innuendo and racial slurs against the<br />\nZulu people, the Coalition has<br />\ngrossly misrepresented Inkatha's stance in South African<br />\npolitics.

This<br />\nprogress is now threatened by<br />\nthe destructive tactics of the<br />\nANC...\" Again, more<br />\nnonsense. As anyone who has<br />\nseen the news from South<br />\nAfrica can testify, the military<br />\nforces of apartheid are in fact<br />\nbecoming more repressive as<br />\npetty laws are revoked merely<br />\nfor window-dressing purposes.<br />\nNo U.S. observer can have the<br />\naudacity to honestly believe<br />\nthat apartheid is crumbling<br />\nwhen eighty black protesters<br /><br />\nwere killed last week alone. As<br />\nfor the tactics of the ANC, that<br />\norganization fought apartheid<br />\nthrough nonviolent resistance<br />\nfrom 1912 to 1960, when 69<br />\nblacks were shot in their backs<br />\nat Sharpeville for burning<br />\npasses (mandatory IDs for<br />\nAfricans). The current ANC<br />\nguerrilla strategy reflects a<br />\nrealistic perception of the need<br />\nin South Africa both for selfdefense and for pressure from<br />\nall fronts, but it is only one part<br />\nof the liberation struggle. The<br />\ndivestment and economic sanctions movement is another part,<br />\none which has been endorsed by<br />\nthe ANC and 77 percent of the<br />\nblack population (Gallup/London Times poll, August 1985).<br />\nOf course, Gatsha Buthelezi<br />\nopposes divestment.<br />\nButhelezi's argument is that<br />\ndivetment will cost jobs.<br />\n(Students for Inkatha argue absurdly that divestment will<br />\n\"destroy millions of jobs for<br />\nblack South Africans\" even<br />\nthough U.S. companies<br />\noperating in S.A. only employ<br />\n60,000 blacks!) We concur that<br />\npressure against apartheid in<br />\nany effective form will be painful both to blacks and whites,<br />\nin that in any transition from<br />\nminority to majority rule,<br />\ndisruptions will occur. The key<br />\nquestion is, do the majority of<br />\nthe people who will be affected<br />\nwant such pressure. The clear<br />\nanswer is yes.

Last year, they discovered<br />\nthat in the brain, the potassium<br />\nchannels in the membranes of<br />\nnerve endings, where one nerve<br />\ncell interacts with the next one,<br />\nwere particularly sensitive to<br />\nPCP.

Normally, a nerve<br />\nimpulse travels along the length<br />\nof the nerve cell, or neuron, to<br />\nthe nerve ending.

The results of this<br />\nwork is due to be published<br />\nsoon<br /><br />\nLI<br />\nDr. Thomas O'Donohue, of<br />\nthe NIH, is studying the PCP<br />\nissue from a different angle.<br />\nHis group is looking at the<br />\nnatural function of the PCP<br />\nreceptors and at a group of endogenous substances call endopsychosins, which seem to be<br />\nthe natural counterpart of<br />\nPCP.<br />\nO'Donohue's work began<br />\nabout eight years ago, before<br />\nPCP had become the widelyabused drug it is today. The<br />\ngreat similarity between the<br />\nsymptoms of PCP intoxication<br />\nand schizophrenia suggested<br />\nthat there may be receptors in<br />\nthe brain for PCP or other<br />\nrelated compounds which are<br />\nsomehow connected with abnormal receptors involved in<br />\nschizophrenia. This idea led to<br /><br />\na search for these receptors by<br />\nseveral research groups, including the NIH. Several<br />\npapers on PCP and related<br />\nreceptors in the brain have<br />\nalready been published.<br />\nO'Donohue has found<br />\nrecently that the locations of<br />\nthe PCP receptors in the brain<br />\nare consistent with the<br />\npsychological effects of PCP.<br />\nUsing radioactive PCP on rats,<br />\nautoradiogram slides showed<br />\nthe two main areas of the brain<br />\nto which PCP binds in large<br />\namounts. These are the cerebral<br />\ncortex, which controls higher<br />\nhuman emotions and cognitive<br />\nprocessing, and the hippocampus, which controls memory.<br />\nResearchers think that when<br />\nPCP binds to these areas, it inhibits their normal activity.<br />\nThese higher functions normally mediate lower brain areas,<br />\nsuch as the hypothalamic and<br />\nlimbic systems. These lower.<br />\nsystems in turn are responsible<br />\nfor the more \"primitive\"<br />\nbehaviors of man. So, when the<br />\ncortical areas are inhibited,<br />\nthese primitive behaviors, such<br />\nas aggression and rage, are unchecked. This theory fits in well<br />\nwith the observed behavior of<br />\npeople on PCP.<br />\nJust in the past two weeks,<br />\none NIH researcher has found<br />\nthat PCP causes amnesia in<br />\nrats. They were unable to<br />\nremember things they learned<br />\nwhile on PCP, although longterm memory was not affected.<br />\nThis finding can be explained<br />\nby the fact that PCP also binds<br />\nto the hippocampus, which is<br />\nresponsible for memory.<br />\nIn 1973, several researchers,<br />\nincluding Dr. Solomon Snyder<br />\nat Hopkins, discovered that the<br />\nhuman brain has specific receptors for opiate compounds.<br />\nPCP had formerly been<br />\nclassified as one of the sigmaopiates, which bind to their<br />\nspecific receptors. Around<br />\n1977, however, it was<br />\ndiscovered that there were PCP<br />\nreceptors in the brain, separate<br />\nfrom the sigma-opiate receptors. The PCP receptor can also<br />\nbind related drugs, such as<br />\nketamine.

Morrill tallied three<br />\ngoals, all on feeds from Wood,<br />\nand added an assist. AllAmerica's Dressel and Craig<br />\nBubier also recorded a goal and<br />\nassist each to aid the cause.<br />\nThe real heroes on this day,<br />\nthough, were the defensive<br />\nplayers. The close defense,<br />\nholstered by the return of cocaptain John DeTommaso,<br />\nwere faced with the unenviable<br />\ntask of shutting down<br />\nVirginia's high-powered attack<br />\nunit that features superstars<br />\nJeff Nicklas and Roddy<br />\nMarino. Nicklas nailed two<br />\ngoais, but Marino, who had 12<br />\ngoing into the game,came away<br />\nwith none, and just one assist.<br />\nFor the Wahoos, it prolonged their streak of frustration<br />\nagainst Hopkins as they fell to<br />\nthe Jays for the tenth straight<br />\ntime and dropped to 3-2 for the<br />\nseason. Many of the losses, like<br />\nSaturday's were near misses,<br />\nmost notably 1985's playoff<br />\ncollapse. Virginia raced out to<br />\na 5-0 lead at Homewood Field,<br />\nbut then could barely hold a<br />\nlead into halftime. Hopkins<br />\ntrailed 6-5, and then went on to<br />\nwin 11-8.<br />\nLast weekend, the game once<br />\nagain could've gone either way.<br />\nIt was tied on five different occasions, and neither squad<br />\ncould hold more than a two<br />\ngoal edge at any time. The<br />\n'Hoos jumped out to 4-2 lead<br />\nearly in the second quarter,<br />\nbefore Hopkins exploded for<br />\nwhat would become four<br />\nunanswered goals. At the 3:38<br /><br />\nmark, Jack Crawford dealt a<br />\nperfect pass to Bubier in front<br />\nof the net, and the junior<br />\ncranked it home past Sheehan.<br />\nWithin a minute and a half, the<br />\nJays tallied again to tie it up at<br />\nfour. This time it was Morrill as<br />\nhe took a pass from Wood on<br />\nthe left side 10 yards out and<br />\nfired one in just inside the left<br />\npost. A goal by Crawford<br />\nbefore intermission gave<br />\nHopkins a 5-4 lead that they<br />\nwould never relinquish.<br />\nEarly in the second half, the<br />\nJays would add one more<br />\nbefore the 'Hoos woke up. At<br />\n2:22, Dressel scored on an assist<br />\nfrom Morrill and it was 6-4 and<br />\nit looked like the rout may be<br />\non. Unfortunately, Virginia<br />\nrefused to cave in, and fought<br />\nback to tie it up. First, Reda<br />\nand then Nicklas scored and<br /><br />\nsuddenly it was knotted up<br />\nagain. Before the 3rd period<br />\nwould close, Hopkins managed<br />\nto take the lead back, this time<br />\nfrom the oddest of contributors. Long-stick middie<br />\nBrad McLam fed fellow rope<br />\nman Steve Mitchell for the<br />\nunusual score with only ten<br />\nseconds to go.<br />\nVirginia bounced right back<br />\nand tied it a final time on a Will<br />\nRosebro goal five minutes into<br />\nthe final period. Eight minutes<br />\nlater, Wood would score and,<br />\nfinally, Hopkins escaped Scott<br />\nStadium with the big win over<br />\na team that ranked as high as<br />\nthird early in the season<br />\nIn between the Syracuse loss<br />\nand the Virginia win, Hopkins<br />\ntook three other games rather<br />\nContinued on rage a<br /><br />\nLaxers Set To Host Heels<br />\nWhen the North Carolina<br />\nTar Heels invade Homewood<br />\nField tomorrow at 2 p.m., fans<br />\nwill be treated to the resumption of what has become the<br />\nmost heated and evenlymatched rivalry in college<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nThe schools have met only<br />\nnine times, but seven have been<br />\nin the last four years and incredibly, all but one has been<br />\ndecided by one goal.

The Heels won last<br />\nyear's contest 11-10 on a last second goal, thus avenging two<br />\n.1984 losses to the Jays, by<br />\nscores of 14-12 and 4-3.<br />\nLook for tomorrow's game<br />\nto be just as exciting. Though<br />\nneither team is number 1 at the<br />\nmoment, the battle will be the<br /><br />\nmost significant one that these<br />\ntwo teams have waged in a<br />\nregular season game. The winner will likely move back into<br />\nthe second seed by tournament<br />\nLime. The loser drops to the<br />\nfifth spot in the polls, barring<br />\na big upset anywhere else.<br />\nShould the losing team not rise<br />\nback into the first four spots,<br />\nthen they will be ineligible for<br />\na home playoff game.<br />\nA loss by Hopkins would be<br />\nserious, but not deadly. The<br />\nJays still play Maryland and<br />\nNavy, and should they take<br />\nboth games they would certainly move up to at least fourth,<br />\nwhich means they'll play at<br />\nhome in the post-season. If<br />\nCarolina loses, though, it could<br />\nwreck their season. They, like<br />\nHopkins, play four more times,<br />\nbut all are at home and none<br />\nagainst any of the other teams<br />\nahead of them. This all means<br />\nthat even if the Heels sweep<br /><br />\ntheir last four, they need some<br />\nhelp from other teams in order<br />\nto move back up.<br />\nGoing into the game, the<br />\nteams seem to be headed in opposite directions.
