The idea of a fine for offenders is also quite<br />\nsuitable.<br />\nHowever, it is a cardinal principle of tlIe English<br />\njudicial system that no rule or fine be imposed retroactively. We must assume that the primary purpose of the<br />\nfine is to disuade people from such practices or punish<br />\nthose people who willfully ignore the rules and the penalty.<br />\nFor this reason we would suggest that a grace period<br />\nof one week he established during which students would<br />\nhe allowed to voluntarily remove the stickers from thcir<br />\ncars, report themselves to the Plant Managers Office, and<br />\nhave their false registration cards removed from the files.<br />\nAt the conclusion of this grace period the $25 penalty<br />\nwould then be imposed upon all violations discovered.<br />\n<br />\nUnited States of Europe?<br />\nBritain's announcement this week of her readiness<br />\nto \"subscribe fully to the aims and objectives\" of the<br />\nEuropean Common Market comes as a surprise to all<br />\nconcerned. This unexpected turn of events has deep implications for Western Europe, the United States and the<br />\nCommunist block in Eastern Europe.<br />\nThe sweeping British committment represents a sharp<br />\ndeparture from that island's traditional isolation attitude<br />\ntoward the economic and political programs of the European Continent. This is the culmination of a bitter internal<br />\nconflict in Britain. The first overtures by the so-called<br />\n\"Inner Six\" were quickly rejected by the majority of British<br />\npublic opinion. Any economic entanglement with the Continent was envisioned as detrimental to England's higher<br />\nstandard of living.<br />\nHowever, the possibility of exclusion from an integrated and thrning European market forced reconsideration of the qu,-.\u2022ation. In an historic decision the British<br />\ngovernment made application last summer to join the<br />\nCommon Market, the eventual aim of which is the complete economic integration of the member states.<br />\nInner Six. members had expected an offer of only<br />\npartial participation by Britain. This week's declaration<br />\nof full participation is of momentous importance, as membership in the community will inevitably entail considerable political association and committment to the Continent.<br />\nThe imphcations are evident. The exhilarating concept of a United States of Europe emerges as a distinct<br />\npossibility. It would constitute a third major power; a<br />\nunique political entity of diverse political, economic and<br />\ncultural composition.

Columbus, was in the three-minute auto<br />\nwash game. His mother, Eleanor (Swifty) Columbus, was a<br />\nsprinter. Christopher was an only child, except for his four<br />\nbrothers and eight sisters. With his father busy all day at the<br />\n-auto wash and his mother constantly away at track meets,<br />\nyoung Columbus was left pretty much to his own devices.<br />\nHowever, the lad did not sulk or brood. He was an avid reader<br />\nand spent all his waking hours immersed in a book. Unfortunately, there was only one book in Genoa at the time\u2014Care of<br />\nthe Horse by Aristotle\u2014and after several years of reading Care<br />\nof the Horse, Columbus grew restless. So when rumor reached<br />\nhim that there was another book in Barcelona\u201e off he ran as<br />\nfast as his fat little legs would carry him.<br />\nThe rumor, alas, proved false. The only book in Barcelona<br />\nwas Cuidar un Caballo by Aristotle, which proved to be nothing<br />\nmore than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.<br />\nBitterly disappointed, Columbus began to dream of going<br />\nto India where, according to legend, there were thousands of<br />\nbooks. But the only way to go to India was on horseback, and<br />\nafter so many years of reading Care of the Horse, Columbus<br />\nnever wanted to clap eyes on a horse again. Then a new thought<br />\nstruck him: perhaps it was ftossible to get to India by sea!<br />\nFired with his revolutionary new idea, Columbus raced to<br />\nthe court of Ferdinand and Isabella on his little fat legs (Columbus, though six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs all his<br />\nlife) and pleaded his case with such fervor that the rulers were<br />\npersuaded.<br />\nOn October 12, 1492, Columbus set foot on the New World.<br />\nThe following year he returned to Spain with a cargo of wonders<br />\nnever before seen in Europe\u2014spices and metals and plants and<br />\nflowers and\u2014most wondrous of all\u2014tobacco! Oh, what a sensation tobacco caused in Europe! The filter had long since been<br />\ninvented (by Aristotle, curiously enough) but nobody knew<br />\nwhat to do with it. Now Columbus, *e Great Discoverer,<br />\nmade still another great discovery: he took a filter, put tobacco<br />\nin front of it, and invented the world's first filter cigarette!<br />\nThrough the centuries filters have been steadily improved<br />\nand so has tobacco, until today we have achieved the ultimate<br />\nin the filter cigarette\u2014Marlboro, of course! Oh, what a piece<br />\nof work is Marlboro! Great tobacco, great filter, great smoke!<br />\nAnd so, good friends, when next you enjoy a fine Marlboro<br />\nCigarette, give a thought to the plucky Genoese, Chris&pher<br />\nColumbus, whose vision and perseverance made the whole<br />\nlovely thing possible.<br />\n1961 Max Stoilmam<br />\n<br />\nTHE WALDORF-ASTORIA<br />\nSte. on Park Avenue, New York,<br />\n4th & 50th<br />\n<br />\nN.Y.,<br />\nConrad N.

Columbus, was in the three-minute auto<br />\nwash game. His mother, Eleanor (Swifty) Columbus, was a<br />\nsprinter. Christopher was an only child, except for his four<br />\nbrothers and eight sisters. With his father busy all day at the<br />\n-auto wash and his mother constantly away at track meets,<br />\nyoung Columbus was left pretty much to his own devices.<br />\nHowever, the lad did not sulk or brood. He was an avid reader<br />\nand spent all his waking hours immersed in a book. Unfortunately, there was only one book in Genoa at the time\u2014Care of<br />\nthe Horse by Aristotle\u2014and after several years of reading Care<br />\nof the Horse, Columbus grew restless. So when rumor reached<br />\nhim that there was another book in Barcelona\u201e off he ran as<br />\nfast as his fat little legs would carry him.<br />\nThe rumor, alas, proved false. The only book in Barcelona<br />\nwas Cuidar un Caballo by Aristotle, which proved to be nothing<br />\nmore than a Spanish translation of Care of the Horse.<br />\nBitterly disappointed, Columbus began to dream of going<br />\nto India where, according to legend, there were thousands of<br />\nbooks. But the only way to go to India was on horseback, and<br />\nafter so many years of reading Care of the Horse, Columbus<br />\nnever wanted to clap eyes on a horse again. Then a new thought<br />\nstruck him: perhaps it was ftossible to get to India by sea!<br />\nFired with his revolutionary new idea, Columbus raced to<br />\nthe court of Ferdinand and Isabella on his little fat legs (Columbus, though six feet tall, was plagued with little fat legs all his<br />\nlife) and pleaded his case with such fervor that the rulers were<br />\npersuaded.<br />\nOn October 12, 1492, Columbus set foot on the New World.<br />\nThe following year he returned to Spain with a cargo of wonders<br />\nnever before seen in Europe\u2014spices and metals and plants and<br />\nflowers and\u2014most wondrous of all\u2014tobacco! Oh, what a sensation tobacco caused in Europe! The filter had long since been<br />\ninvented (by Aristotle, curiously enough) but nobody knew<br />\nwhat to do with it. Now Columbus, *e Great Discoverer,<br />\nmade still another great discovery: he took a filter, put tobacco<br />\nin front of it, and invented the world's first filter cigarette!<br />\nThrough the centuries filters have been steadily improved<br />\nand so has tobacco, until today we have achieved the ultimate<br />\nin the filter cigarette\u2014Marlboro, of course! Oh, what a piece<br />\nof work is Marlboro!
