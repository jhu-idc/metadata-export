This occurred on<br />\nHalloween evening, October 31.<br />\nOn Monday night, October 30,<br />\ngirls from Notre Dame went to<br />\nthe Phi Gam House and spread<br />\ntoilet paper over the grounds.<br />\nThis disturbance lasted until<br />\nabout 11:00 pm. On the next<br />\nnight, the girls from Notre Dame<br />\nreturned. This time the<br />\ndisturbance was louder and lasted<br />\nlonger, according to Gam<br />\nmembers.<br />\nAt the same time this was<br />\ngoing on, Beta House attacked<br />\nTEP House with eggs.

They<br />\nare too much noise, shabby<br />\nappearance and bad parking.<br />\nThe throwing of the paint was<br />\nblamed on Gam. Brothers from<br />\nthe fraternity denied this but<br />\nremoved the paint from the<br />\nHorn's door as a gesture of<br />\ngoodwill.

Student<br />\nCouncil President Andy Savitz<br />\nand others recommended<br />\nadoption of the policy used at<br />\nPrinceton whereby students must<br />\ninclude in their exams a written<br />\nacknowledgement of the basic<br />\nprinciples of the school's honor<br />\ncode.<br />\nSavitz argued that efforts<br />\nshould be made to canvass<br />\nfaculty members and convince<br />\nthem of the credence in citing<br />\nkey passages from the Code to<br />\nstudents before every exam.<br />\nSeveral causes of cheating<br />\nadvanced at the hearings ranged<br />\nfrom laxity of the honor system<br />\n<br />\nto the rigorous academic pressure<br />\nof Hopkins courses. Richard<br />\nRubin, a member of the Honor<br />\nCommission, commented that<br />\ncases of cheating often involve<br />\nstudents who panic, who are<br />\nlazy, or who are premeditated<br />\ncheaters.<br />\nHe recommended \"stopping<br />\ncheating before it starts\" with<br />\nsuch innovations as proctored<br />\nexams and broadened pass-fail<br />\noptions. He added that such early<br />\ndeterrant measures were of<br />\npressing importance because \"no<br />\none wants to go on record as a<br />\nstool pigeon.\"<br />\nConsensus was reached on one<br />\npoint, that the highest incidence<br />\nof cheating occurs in science<br />\nhomework and lab reports. This<br />\nwas attributed to the inclination<br />\namong such students to<br />\ncollaborate with one another in<br />\ngetting assignments done.<br />\nFavorable sentiment for a<br />\nstiffer penalty system was voiced,<br />\nbut most attending agreed that<br />\nthe current system provided the<br />\n\"needed flexibility.\"<br />\nOne sophomore member of<br />\nthe Commission maintained the<br />\n\"gut course and cheating are the<br />\ntwo things that keep Hopkins<br />\nfrom exploding.\u2014<br />\n<br />\nSafdie: Compliment nature with architecture<br />\nBy PETER GARDNER<br />\n\"Architecture today must be<br />\nconsidered as a tool and<br />\nextension of society and not<br />\nmerely as the product of the<br />\nindividual artist -architect,\"<br />\nproposed Canadian architect and<br />\ndesigner Moshe Safdie to a<br />\n<br />\nMoshe Safche<br />\n<br />\nShriver Hall audience Tuesday.<br />\nAddressing himself to the<br />\nproblem of \"Creativity in Urban<br />\nDevelopment,\" Safdie told his<br />\nmoderately sized audience that it<br />\nwould be impossible to improve<br />\nthe quality of the environment<br />\nwithout \"an expansion of the<br />\npublic's understanding of it<br />\nSafdie was speaking at the eighth<br />\nlecture of the Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium.<br />\nSafdie suggested that creativity<br />\nin urban development required<br />\nboth an examination of those<br />\n\"environments in which we have<br />\nbeen successful,\" and \" the<br />\nquestioning of the nature of<br />\ncreativity in its relation to the<br />\nnature of the environment.\"<br />\nSafdie delved into the nature<br />\nof 'creativity with a consideration<br />\nof \"the two attitudes which have<br />\nbeen most involved in the process<br />\n:of making the environment.\"<br />\n.These, he explained, were the<br />\ntradition of the professional<br />\narchitect and that of the<br />\n<br />\ncraftsman, vernacular architect.<br />\nHe advanced the examples of a<br />\nhouse built by an arab peasant<br />\nand one built by a prOfessional<br />\narchitect, as representing the<br />\nvernacular and professional<br />\ntraditions respectively.<br />\nSafdie stressed that the<br />\narchitecture of the vernacular<br />\nhad more \"fitness to purpose\"<br />\nthan the stage sets of the<br />\nprofessional architects.

Contrary to rumors. Hopkins<br />\nhas not experienced a tremendous growth<br />\nin serious crime; in the past year, there<br />\nhave been no murders, no rapes (the last<br />\nattempt before October's was ten months<br />\nago), and no robberies. Larcenies have,<br />\nfor the most part, been restricted to<br />\nbicycles, automobile accessories, and<br />\nstereo sets.<br />\nProtection Adequate<br />\nIt is proper to inquire whether or not<br />\nour present security arrangement is<br />\nconfronted with a crisis; and, if so,<br />\nwhether appropriate measures have been<br />\nsuggested for its solution. Indeed, Major<br />\nClarence Roy, the City's Deputy Police<br />\nChief for Patrol Area no. 2 (which<br />\nincludes the Homewood campus), told<br />\nthis writer that the University was<br />\nreceiving \"adequate police protection,\"<br />\nand cited its low crime rate as indicative<br />\nof that fact.<br />\n\u2022 The proposals being advanced for<br />\nsecurity are a mixed bunch of ideas,<br />\nwithout discernible coherency. It will<br />\ncertainly help to trim back shrubbery<br />\nwhere it obstructs a clear view.<br />\nInstallation of high intensity sodium<br />\nvapor lights, to replace the current<br />\nincandescent lamps, would also be<br />\nhelpful. The campus would benefit from<br />\nthe installation of security phones,<br />\nalthough a dozen would be sufficient to<br />\nprovide needed coverage (the News-Letter<br />\nreported their cost as $10 per month;<br />\naccording to the C & P Telephone<br />\nCompany, only an $11 installation fee<br />\nand a monthly rate of $4.25 would be<br />\ncharged.) .<br />\nAnother Expense<br />\nA student security patrol, however,<br />\nwould be preposterous if the University<br />\nhad extra money to spend on such<br />\nfrivolity; with its current financial crisis,<br />\nit is the height of absurdity. Unarmed,<br />\nuntrained, and inexperienced, a student<br />\npatrol would still have to be equipped<br />\nwith uniforms and two-way radios;<br />\nsalaries would constitute another<br />\nexpense. The University should not waste<br />\nmoney and other resources on an<br />\namateurish venture of this nature. Police<br />\nwork, if worthwhile, is a professional<br />\nactivity. A student patrol would merely<br />\ndelay again the necessary upgrading of.<br />\nthe primary campus patrol force, while<br />\nexposing the student participants to<br />\nexcessive danger and allowing all other<br />\nmembers of the University community no<br />\nreal increase in safety.<br />\nPositive Steps<br />\nThe University should take some<br />\nOositive steps which have not, apparently.<br />\n<br />\n....mdowt<br />\n<br />\n4.

Not only should<br />\none be concerned with his or her own<br />\nsafety; there should be a sense of<br />\ncommunity concern. To squelch<br />\ncounter -productive rumors, the<br />\nNews-Letter should press for regular<br />\ndisclosure of campus crime statistics (by<br />\nmonthly count if not by individual<br />\nincident) that would provide reassurance<br />\nor the incentive to redouble<br />\nsecurity-consciousness.<br />\nSafety is everyone's business -- no one<br />\nhas an automatic immunity to criminal<br />\nattack.

But<br />\nfrustration that those of us who worked it was like banging his head against the<br />\nlike hell to elect McGovern made so little wall. He never \"turned the corner,\" as did<br />\nimpact in over two months of Humphrey.

As if that weren't enough, the<br />\nEagleton thing had to happen. It hung<br />\nlike a cloud over the campaign and acted<br />\nto hamper any progress McGovern could<br />\nhave made.<br />\nNoble intention, bad politics<br />\nI do not mean to absolve McGovern<br />\nfrom any guilt for the debacle which has<br />\njust occurred. He was obviously not the<br />\nchoice of the rank-and-file Democrats<br />\nwho have provided the muscle of the<br />\nparty for the last few decades. Not that<br />\nhis ideas were all that different from<br />\nKennedy's or Muskie's; he just made so<br />\nlittle effort to finesse them and present<br />\nthem in a less threatening manner. Quite<br />\nto the contrary. McGovern ran for<br />\nPresident and actually told people what<br />\nhe wanted to do. Noble intention, bad<br />\npolitics.<br />\nI know McGovern came across as a<br />\nweak and \"wishy-washy\" personality to<br />\nmany Americans who value virility more<br />\nthan principle. But it was his guts which<br />\nwon me over last spring. The remark of<br />\nhis which remains with me is, \"I am fed<br />\nup with old men dreaming up wars for<br />\nyoung men to die in.\" One thing 1972 proved was that the<br />\nconventional wisdom regarding politics is<br />\nsubstantially correct. The votes are in the<br />\ncenter and McGovern is the \"Goldwater<br />\nof the Left.\" The Republicans learned<br />\nfrom the Goldwater defeat and went on<br />\nto win the Presidency the next time<br />\naround. I am confident that, in this<br />\nrespect, history will repeat itself. The new<br />\nslogan - to borrow a page from the<br />\nRepublicans- \"Only Four More Years 'Til<br />\n'76!\"<br />\n<br />\nsays, \"yes sir.\" (Gene, why don't you<br />\nmove over so these men can get a picture<br />\nof you at the console.)

It all works so well.<br />\nThe really disturbing section, the part<br />\nwhich truly ties people to the machines,<br />\nis where they sort letters. There are<br />\nmaybe seventy people, each in front of a<br />\nconsole. A mechanical arm puts a letter in<br />\nfront of them once every second, and<br />\nthey have to punch out the last three<br />\ndigits of the zip code on a keyboard.<br />\nSixty letters a minute, or they can't hold<br />\nthe job. They do this for eight hours a<br />\nday, and thirty minutes of every hour is<br />\nspent sweeping up the letters that the<br />\nmachines drop. They drop alot of them<br />\nbecause it's all done so quickly. (Where<br />\nya71 from? Hopkins. You going to do a<br />\nstory on us? Yeah.) The shifts are<br />\nstaggered, so bells go off every few<br />\nminutes to get the people moving and at<br />\ntheir places. This is not General Motors;<br />\nthis is the government. It's a post office,<br />\nnot a factory. The distinctions fade. It's a<br />\nletter factory.<br />\nOne of the toys the supervisors have in<br />\nthe room is a dial that's ,connected to a<br />\nlarge scale-type meter, numbered from<br />\none to seventy-five. The pointer was set<br />\njust a little above the sixty mark, and Mr.<br />\nDemetriades looked at it and said,<br />\n\"Everyday they make a gain.\" Sixty<br />\nletters a minute, remember?, Modern<br />\nTimes.<br />\nWe didn't talk to any of the employees<br />\nin this area (Please don't cross the painted<br />\nyellow line.), but Mr. Demetriades took<br />\nus into his confidence as we watched a<br />\ngroup of people hand sorting letters<br />\nwithout zip codes. \"Now, these people<br />\naren't very fast. (Hi, how ya doing?<br />\nGood, thanks.) They tend to talk which<br />\nslows them down. You see - they've seen<br />\nus watching, and that's going to distract<br />\nthem even more.\" There are already some<br />\nsolutions for their problem: \"We've<br />\nemployed about one hundred deaf-mutes,<br />\nand they do a terrific job. They aren't<br />\ndistracted so easily. On those machines,<br />\nthey're faster than the people who have<br />\nall their faculties.\" Later on we passed<br />\none of the secretaries in the hall, and it<br />\nwas whispered that she was blind. \"She<br />\ndoes a great job. Our handicapped people<br />\nhave worked out very well.\" We did hear<br />\nthat the deaf workers were kept separate<br />\nfrom each other because that kept them<br />\nfrom using sign language. What a<br />\nwonderful, wonderful place to work,<br />\nespecially if you're a machine or can act<br />\nlike one for a few hours every day.<br />\n\"The Post Office has really progressed<br />\nwith technology,\" we were told. What's<br />\n<br />\ndisturbing is that the Post Office is proud,<br />\nso proud of the totality of the building<br />\nthat they don't worry about the crap<br />\npeople have to put up with to make it<br />\noperate.<br />\nThere is a sign on one of the 'file<br />\ncabinets in Mr. Demetriades' office.<br />\n\"Customer service comes first with me.\"<br />\nI'm sure that he and the Baltimore<br />\nPostmaster genuinely try to serve that<br />\nprinciple, but maybe they made the<br />\nwrong kind of sacrifices in serving it.<br />\nBefore we left the building, Mr.<br />\nDemetriades asked if we would send him<br />\na few copies of whatever articles we<br />\nwrote. \"Send five or six if they're really<br />\ngood. The Postmaster will want to send<br />\nthem on up.\" I just don't know what I<br />\nshould say. How could he have possibly<br />\nknown?

In that memorable<br />\nencounter, Dickinson led 21-0 at<br />\nthe half and 28-22 with 50<br />\nseconds to play, before Jack<br />\n<br />\nThomas ran ten yards for a<br />\nHopkins touchdown and a /9-18<br />\nvictory.<br />\nDickinson has many returning<br />\nlettermen this year, and they<br />\ncertainly haven't forgotten their<br />\nlast confrontation with the Blue<br />\nJays. With that memory still<br />\nfresh in their minds, the Devils<br />\nshould be an even tougher<br />\nadversary.<br />\nEven without this added<br />\nincentive; Dickinson would<br />\nhardly be considered a<br />\n\"pushover.\u2014 Their effective<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTIER<br />\n<br />\nspoRTs<br />\nNetmen promise'different look'<br />\nBy STEVE BROWN<br />\nOn Thursday, November 30th,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nbasketball season opens. The<br />\nBlue Jays drew Towson State for<br />\nthe opening round of the Schafer<br />\nMetro Tournament. Presently,<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert is in the<br />\nprocess of conditioning and<br />\ndrilling his thirteen man squad in<br />\nan attempt to ready them for a<br />\nlong and trying season.<br />\nThe 1972-3 team promises to<br />\nshow a different look. Coach<br />\nRupert is blessed with more<br />\nspeed, scoring punch, height and<br />\ndesire. In the past, comparatively<br />\nsmall teams forced coaches into<br />\nball control strategies. However,<br />\na strong bench and \"a lot of guys<br />\nof equal ability\" will allow the<br />\nteam to play an exciting, wide<br />\nopen brand of basketball this<br />\nyear with a fast break offense, a<br />\npressing defense and more<br />\nrunning than ever before.<br />\nThe strategy for this season<br />\nwill be to utilize effectively all<br />\nthirteen players and, therefore,<br />\nwear down opponents. Since<br />\nthere is not much difference in<br />\nthe abilities of many of the<br />\nplayers, frequent substitutions<br />\nwill enable five fresh ballplayers<br />\nto be on the court at all times.<br />\nThe team is young, with only<br />\none senior, but three starting<br />\njuniors all have a year's experience<br />\nunder their belts. Five fine<br />\nsophomores up from last year's<br />\n11-2 freshman team and one<br />\nfreshman round out the squad.<br />\nCoach Rupert has welcomed<br />\nthe competitive spirit and<br />\nenthusiasm of each practice with<br />\nopen arms. The second five fills<br />\nbeen pushing the starters, thus<br />\nproviding the competition which<br />\nwill eventually benefit everyone<br />\n<br />\nin the end.<br />\nJohn Rutter and Bobby<br />\nFreedman, both guards, are the<br />\nteam's co-captains. They are<br />\njuniors and returning starters<br />\nfrom last year's team. Coach<br />\nRupert sees them as \"exceptional<br />\nleaders,\" and ability-wise, they<br />\nare playing the best they ever<br />\nhave. Rutter is the quarterback<br />\non the court, and Bobby.plays a<br />\nsound offensive and defensive<br />\ngame.<br />\nSurprise!<br />\nChuck LaBerge, at 6'5\", has<br />\nbeen 41 surprise to many. After<br />\nworking hard for the entire<br />\nsummer, Chuck came back tc<br />\nschool willing and ready to play.<br />\nThe 6'7\" Bill Jews is also back<br />\nfrom last year's starting quintet.<br />\nAlthough a potential superstar,<br />\nit's all a matter of consisten-cy<br />\nand desire with Jews. Right now<br />\nhe is playing super ball, and is<br />\nalmost impossible to stop.<br />\nPaul Spence, a 6'1\"<br />\nsophomore, is the only<br />\nnewcomer to the varsity who is<br />\nstarting. Spence, last year's<br />\nfreshman phenomenon, has been<br />\ntabbed \"a super ballplayer\" by<br />\nRupert. He is a great shooter and<br />\nan unselfish player, and also led<br />\nhis freshman team in scoring and<br />\nassists.<br />\nForward Freshmen<br />\nJoining Spence from the<br />\nfreshmen team are forwards Greg<br />\nDeLong, Tom Davis and Andy<br />\nWalder, and guard Andy<br />\nSchrieber. At 6'4\" DeLong and<br />\nWalder are strong rebounders and<br />\ngood shooters. The 6'3\" Davis is<br />\nan excellent outside shooter and<br />\na fine driver. Schrieber, although<br />\nonly 6'1\", is probably the best<br />\nleaper on the team and extremely<br />\nfast.<br />\n<br />\nAlso returning from last year's<br />\nvarsity are Glen Rasin and Doug<br />\nCampbell, both guards. Campbell<br />\nhas become more aggressive and<br />\nis no longer hesitant of shooting.<br />\nRasin proved his worth as a floor<br />\ngeneral when he chipped in at the<br />\nend of last season.<br />\nThe only two who didn't play<br />\nbasketball at Johns Hopkins last<br />\nyear also happens to be the only<br />\nsenior and the only freshman on<br />\nthis year's squad. Al Robinson, a<br />\nsenior guard, had trouble with his<br />\nknees and sat out last season.<br />\nHowever, he is very quick and<br />\nprobably the best defensive<br />\nplayer on the team. Freshman<br />\nDrew Fender is coach Rupert's<br />\n\"pleasant surprise.\" At 6'S\" he is<br />\naggressive, a good shooter and<br />\nshot blocker, and an excellent<br />\nrebounder.<br />\n<br />\nmultiple offense is led by star<br />\nquarterback Jeff Truskey, whom<br />\nHopkins Coach Denny Cox calls<br />\n\"another Jack Thomas.\" Like<br />\nThomas, Truskey can both run<br />\nand pass and, most importantly,<br />\nis an extremely \"heady\" signal<br />\ncaller. As Dickinson's principle<br />\nthreat, he is \"the man we have to<br />\nstop,\" according to Coach Cox.<br />\nTruskey is not without help,<br />\nhowever, because the Devils have<br />\nan outst a ndi ng pass-catching<br />\nthreat in flanker Mark Lipstein,<br />\nwhom Cox considers \"one of the<br />\nbest receivers in the MAC.\"<br />\nAnother man to watch is tailback<br />\nGerry Urich, the Devils' leading<br />\nrusher, who runs through holes<br />\nopened by an offensive line that<br />\ndverages over 200 pounds.<br />\nDickinson is not quite as<br />\nstrong defensively as offensively,<br />\nbut, in Cox's words, \"They get<br />\nthe job done.\" Standouts among<br />\nthe defenders are safetymen Jim<br />\nSlobozien and Craig Bornholm,<br />\nand linebackers Gene Sienkiewicz<br />\nand Bill Stabert.<br />\nThe Blue Jays are not without<br />\nincentives of their own, however,<br />\nbecause they have yet to win two<br />\ngames in a row this season, and<br />\nare striving for a back-to-back<br />\nconsistent performances. And<br />\nwhile this is not the Blue Jays'<br />\nlast game of the year, it is their<br />\nfinal home contest, and they<br />\nwould like nothing better than to<br />\nwin their remaining two games to<br />\nduplicate last year's 6-3 record.<br />\nAccording to Coach Cox,\"the<br />\nkeys to victory are an absence of<br />\nturnovers and solid hard-hitting<br />\nall over the field.\" Consistency is<br />\nhoped for, and, in the Coach's<br />\nwords, \"Our defense is going to<br />\nhave to do another good job.\"<br />\nTomorrow is the last chance for<br />\nHopkins students to cheer them<br />\nin that effort.<br />\n<br />\nthe Blue Jay cross country team<br />\ntravels to Mt. St. Mary's College<br />\nin western Maryland for that<br />\nschool's annual invitational meet.<br />\nThe meet, \u2022which originally<br />\ninvited only teams from the<br />\nnorthern part of the<br />\nMason-Dixon conference, is an<br />\nall-area invitational and includes<br />\nteams from across the Free State<br />\nand several from Pennsylvania.<br />\nThe Mount is a perrenial<br />\nfavorite, although they did not<br />\nwin last year. Hopkins' stiffest<br />\ncompetition will probably be<br />\nfrom Gettysburg and Towson on<br />\na team basis; while freshman<br />\nGordon Oliver of Mt. St. Mary's<br />\nis favored to win the individual<br />\ntitle.<br />\nSpiked Shoe<br />\nOliver, a graduate of<br />\nBethesda-Chevy Chase High<br />\nSchool,, won the Hopkins Spiked<br />\nShoe meet and last year won the<br />\nhigh school section of the two<br />\nmile run at the Penn Relays.<br />\nThe entire day will be devoted<br />\nto cross country as there will be:<br />\nraces in the high school,<br />\ncollegiate, and open divisions.<br />\nThe college division features a<br />\n5.2 mile race with barriers of hay<br />\nto give the race more of a<br />\nresemblance to a real<br />\ncross-country competition.<br />\nAccording to Coach Masken,<br />\n\"This is going to be a<br />\ncross-country day and I'm sure<br />\nthere will be good competition at<br />\nall levels. The barriers should also<br />\nhelp to add a little more zest to<br />\nthe race.How Fare<br />\nHopkins plans to take its seven<br />\ntop placers from the conference<br />\nmeet on the sixth, which were<br />\nDoyle, Dubiel, Greves, Higdon,<br />\nPerrone, Tetzlaff, and Van Dyke.<br />\nAsked how he thinks the tearn<br />\nwill fare the coach commented,<br />\n\"After the championships there's<br />\nusually a let down because it's as<br />\nif the season is over. It won't be<br />\neasy to get up for this meet, but<br />\nwith the guys we're taking we'll<br />\ndo as well as possible.\"<br />\nThe week after the Mount St.<br />\nMary's Invitational the Jays<br />\ntravel to Westminister, Md. for a<br />\ndual meet with Western Maryland<br />\nCollege. \"If we do well at the<br />\nMount we'll do well against<br />\nWestern Maryland.

The<br />\nresult is that only seven players<br />\nremain from last year's edition<br />\nwhich battled tooth and nail in<br />\nsix games with the Nova Scotia<br />\nVoyageurs for the Calder Cup.<br />\nThis year's veteran returnees<br />\ninclude goalie Jim Shaw,<br />\nforwards Jim Bartlett, Brian<br />\nMurphy, Bob Rivard, Marc<br />\nDufour, and defensemen Jim<br />\nMorrison and Wally Chevrier.<br />\nSince Murphy, Rivard and<br />\nDufour all consitute one line, the<br />\nmost potent, Clipper fans have<br />\nalready been dismayed at the<br />\nteam's lack of harmony, as well<br />\nas firepower.<br />\nWhen the Clippers opened up<br />\ntheir season impressively,<br />\nsplitting their first three games,<br />\nall on the road, the Rivard,<br />\nMurphy, Dufour trio erupted for<br />\nan astounding 20 points.<br />\nHowever, when the Clippers<br />\nSkidded through a three game<br />\nlosing streak, the unit was hardly<br />\nnoticed.<br />\nPeople were beginning to<br />\nwonder what happened to the<br />\nClipper attack, particularly when<br />\nthe Clippers consistently failed to<br />\n<br />\nconvert in \"power play\"<br />\nsituations. Then Murphy and<br />\nRivard each scored against<br />\nCincinnati, Murphy lit the lamp<br />\ntwice more in a 2-2 tie at<br />\nCleveland, Dufour scored the hat<br />\n<br />\ntrick in Sunday's 74 loss at<br />\nProvidence, and Murphy tallied<br />\ntwice more in Tuesday's 7-4<br />\nvictory over Springfield. The real<br />\nproblem is whether one line is<br />\nenough to supply the Clipper's<br />\n<br />\noffense, and if not, why anyone<br />\nelse hasn't picked up the slack.<br />\nPerhaps the case o'f Jim Bartlett<br />\nmight provide some clue.<br />\nIn a league that guarantees a<br />\nyear by year turnover of each<br />\n<br />\nteam's roster, Jim Bartlett has<br />\nturned out to be an invaluable<br />\npossession. But even the Clippers'<br />\nseven year veteran, famous for<br />\nhis wild emotional outbursts that<br />\ncould singlehandedly reverse the<br />\nmomentum of a game, had failed<br />\nin recent encounters to generate<br />\nany noise with his stick.<br />\nPrior to last Wednesday's game<br />\nat Richmond,\"Black Bart\", as he<br />\nis affectionately called by his<br />\nteammates, had scored only five<br />\ngoals, three of which came in the<br />\nsame game. Other than that,<br />\nBartlett had compiled only four<br />\nassists in the first twelve games of<br />\nthe season. Perhaps, it is too<br />\nearly in the season for Bartlett,<br />\nwho saves his greatest<br />\nperformances for pressure<br />\npacked, back against the wall<br />\nsituations, like his hat trick in the<br />\ndivision clinching game against<br />\nRochester last year.<br />\nThe question is how long one<br />\nmust wait for the Clippers'<br />\ncolorful left-wing to return to his<br />\nold form, and whether this is the<br />\nsame hockey player that led the<br />\nClippers in scoring in the<br />\n1969-70 season. Only Bartlett<br />\ncan provide the answers.<br />\nIf the attack is erratic right<br />\nnow, the defense must deal with<br />\nan entirely different problem.<br />\nThe ageless Jim Morrison, now in<br />\nhis 21st season, and veteran<br />\nWally Chevrier rely heavily on<br />\nexperiences, something that<br />\ncannot match up to the early<br />\nseason speed of younger<br />\nperformers. At age 41, one<br />\nwonders how long Morrison can<br />\nkeep it up. But the former NHL<br />\nveteran has seen a lot of players<br />\ncome and go, and if he keeps in<br />\nshape, he will see a lot more.

His Blue Jays had just lost,<br />\n'<br />\n2 1, to Western Maryland, and in<br />\nhis eyes, one<br />\ncould see an entire<br />\nYear of<br />\ndisappointment, of six<br />\nfrustrating one goal losses that<br />\nhave made a<br />\nmockery of a good<br />\nteam.<br />\nAs usual,<br />\nHopkins completely<br />\ndo minated the<br />\nlast 3 quarters of<br />\nthe<br />\ngame. Frank Curnoles was<br />\nextraordinary<br />\nin the midfield,<br />\ncontrolling<br />\nthe ball skillfully and<br />\nProviding his mates with plenty<br />\nof room to<br />\nmaneuver. He<br />\nreceived ample help from<br />\nfullbacks<br />\nJoe Rutkowski and<br />\nAndy Smith and inside Mark<br />\n<br />\nManzione, all of whom played<br />\ncreatively and intelligently.<br />\nUnfortunately, the attack a, as<br />\nit had done all season, collapsed<br />\ninside the Green Terror penalty<br />\narea. Time and again, sustained<br />\nthrusts were thwarted by by<br />\ncareless passes made either too<br />\nquickly or too late, and by<br />\ngrossly inaccurate shooting.<br />\nDuring the first half, Western<br />\nMaryland was going downhill on<br />\ntheir sloping pitch with the wind<br />\nat their backs. They used this<br />\nadvantage cleverly and scored on<br />\ntheir first chance. Fullback Hall,<br />\nwho was outstanding throughout,<br />\nintercepted a pass at midfield and<br />\nfloated one that sent Wilcock in<br />\nalone. Goalie Keith Naunheim<br />\ncharged a little hesitantly but<br />\nWilcock made the mistake<br />\nacademic with a thundering shot<br />\n<br />\nThe goal came at the 7.55<br />\nmark and the Terrors added<br />\n'another only 16 seconds later.<br />\nAgain Hall intercepted and sent<br />\nWilcock on a semi-breakaway.<br />\nNaunheim came out for the first<br />\nsave but it rebounded to Ilupejt<br />\nwho had an open n.t. Charlie<br />\nGilman slid across the goalmouth<br />\nto make a great stop but<br />\nBuchanan volleyed home on the<br />\nthird try.<br />\nMoments later Naunheim<br />\nmade a tine grab of a shot that<br />\nwould have put the game out of<br />\nreach and Hopkins finally went<br />\nto work. Manzione found<br />\nRoberto Arguero open in front<br />\nbut his shot soared high over the<br />\nbar.<br />\nStill JHU pressed the attack<br />\nand Lou Podrazik's persistance<br />\npaid off in a goal. The freshman<br />\nback chased a ball all the way to<br />\nthe backline, fought off two<br />\ndefenders and centered crisply to<br />\nManzione who tallied before<br />\ngoalie Hannaby could turn<br />\naround.<br />\nThe second half was pure<br />\ntravesty.

Consequently, the<br />\nlimits of post-election\" analysis<br />\nare much more clearly defined<br />\nthan the almost limitless range of<br />\npre-election inquiry. Now we<br />\nmust deal with the definitive<br />\nelection results and try to<br />\nunderstand what these figures<br />\ninfer concerning the current<br />\nelectoral composition, shifts in<br />\ntraditional consistency, and the<br />\nestablishment of possible trends.<br />\nEven though we lack the<br />\nanalytical expertise of the<br />\npolitical scientists, we can still<br />\ndissect a little of what happened<br />\nlast Tuesday.<br />\nIt is clear by now (if it wasn't<br />\nby 7:30 Tuesday night) that<br />\nPresident Nixon was re-elected<br />\nby landslide proportions. At last<br />\ncount, Nixon had received 60.8%<br />\nof the popular vote which still<br />\nleaves former President Lyndon<br />\nJohnson holding the trophy with<br />\n61.1% in his landslide victory<br />\nover Senator Barry Goldwater in<br />\n1964. Nixon also received 521<br />\nelectoral votes, well over the 270<br />\nneeded for re-election. If we stop<br />\nhere, if you turned your tubes<br />\noff at 7:30, it appears that the<br />\nelection was anything but close;<br />\nthat Nixon received a sweeping<br />\nmandate; that conservatism is on<br />\nthe rise in America. If we go<br />\nbeyond the presidential election<br />\nresults, however, we find that the<br />\nelection was quite close, that<br />\nNixon's sweeping mandate was<br />\nnothing more than a \"lonely<br />\nlandslide,\" that moderation and<br />\neven liberalism faired quite well.<br />\nI speak, of course, of the<br />\nCongressional and gubernatorial<br />\ncontests. Many commentators<br />\nhad conceded Nixon's re-election<br />\nearly Tuesday evening. Their<br />\nprimary realm of discussion was<br />\nhow extensive the \"coattail<br />\n<br />\neffect\" would be ,and how many<br />\ncandidates in Congressional and<br />\nstate races would be swept into<br />\noffice by a Nixon landslide. Clark<br />\nMacGregor, the CREEP<br />\n(Committee to Re-elect the<br />\nPresident) Director, was<br />\nconvinced that a Republican<br />\ntakeover in Congress would result<br />\nin a Nixon landslide of 60<br />\npercent or more. Now that the<br />\nresults are in, it appears that<br />\nRepublican candidates had<br />\ntrouble grabbing the President's<br />\nundershirt much less his coattails.<br />\nThe congressional and<br />\ngubernatorial elections show just<br />\nhow personal and nonpartisan<br />\nPresident Nixon's victory is. The<br />\nGOP picked up only 13 House<br />\nseats, 8 of which are in the<br />\nSouth. The GOP Congressional<br />\ndelegation will be no better (in<br />\nnumbers) than the one they<br />\nfielded in 1967. In the Senate,<br />\nthe GOP managed to do the<br />\nincredible by actually showing a<br />\nnet loss of two seats. Senators<br />\nMiller (Iowa), Smith (Maine),<br />\n<br />\nAllott (Colorado), and Boggs<br />\n(Delaware), all considered safe<br />\nRepublican seats, lost to their<br />\nDemocratic Challengers. The<br />\nDemocrats also picked up retiring<br />\nRepublican seats in Kentucky<br />\nand South Dakota. In these six<br />\nSt ates President Nixon's total<br />\nvote ranged from 54 percent in<br />\nSouth Dakota to .64% in<br />\nKentucky. His underlings faired 5<br />\nto 20 percentage points lower.<br />\nEven where the GOP picked up<br />\nfour seats (Oklahoma, North<br />\nCarolina, New Mexico, and<br />\nVirginia), their vote totals wer<br />\nstill embarrassing. The most any<br />\ncandidate could muster in these<br />\nfour states was 54% while<br />\nPresident Nixon didn't slip under<br />\n62%. After gleaning over these<br />\nresults, even the director of the<br />\nRepublican Senate Election<br />\nCommittee was prompted to<br />\nadmit that there was no coattail<br />\neffect.<br />\nIn the gubernatorial election,<br />\nthe results are the same.

The State Central Crime Records<br />\nBineau, Maryland State Police, recently<br />\nreleased statistics covering the period<br />\nJanuary through June, 1972. The City<br />\nreported to SCCRB 146 homicides, 244<br />\nforcible rapes, 4,578 robberies, and 3,029<br />\naggravated assaults -- accounting, in each<br />\ncategory, for more than one-half of such<br />\nincidents in the State of Maryland. While<br />\nthe City's record is not enviable, one can<br />\nunderstand why crime would tend to be<br />\nconcentrated in high population-density<br />\nareas rather than the more rural regions<br />\nof the State.

At the<br />\nCouncil meeting, a proposal was voiced to extend the last<br />\ndate for selecting a student's Pass/Fail course to the last<br />\nexam date. The concept of unlimited Pass/Fail was called<br />\nfor at the hearings as one possible method for reducing the<br />\namount ofcheating in the University.<br />\nA change in the Pass/Fail system should be instituted<br />\nwhich would allow undergraduates to choose between either taking all their courses Pass/Fail from the beginning of<br />\nthe semester, or selecting one course persemester on a Pass/Fail grading basis no later than the last exam date of a<br />\nsemester. There is no reason why the University should<br />\nprevent students, particularly humanities and social science<br />\nmajors, from taking all of their courses for a semester Pass/Fsil system as long as the student declares this option at<br />\nthe beginning ofthe semester.<br />\nThe second alternative, a simple modification of the present Pass/Fail system, would give the student the opportunity to apply the Pass/Fail grade to the course of his choosing after the grading for the course has been completed.<br />\nIn the final estimation, it is clear that the present Pass/Fail system, which forces the student into a four-week<br />\ngambling session to see which course would be more advantageous to take Pass/Fail, is defeating its purpose and must<br />\nbe changed.<br /><br />\nChunks of machinery; bits and pieces ofpeople<br /><br />\nBy ROBERT RUBY<br />\nbeen seriously considered.

Indeed, Major<br />\nClarence Roy, the City's Deputy Police<br />\nChief for Patrol Area no. 2 (which<br />\nincludes the Homewood campus), told<br />\nthis writer that the University was<br />\nreceiving \"adequate police protection,\"<br />\nand cited its low crime rate as indicative<br />\nof that fact.<br />\n\u2022 The proposals being advanced for<br />\nsecurity are a mixed bunch of ideas,<br />\nwithout discernible coherency. It will<br />\ncertainly help to trim back shrubbery<br />\nwhere it obstructs a clear view.<br />\nInstallation of high intensity sodium<br />\nvapor lights, to replace the current<br />\nincandescent lamps, would also be<br />\nhelpful. The campus would benefit from<br />\nthe installation of security phones,<br />\nalthough a dozen would be sufficient to<br />\nprovide needed coverage (the News-Letter<br />\nreported their cost as $10 per month;<br />\naccording to the C &amp; P Telephone<br />\nCompany, only an $11 installation fee<br />\nand a monthly rate of $4.25 would be<br />\ncharged.) .<br />\nAnother Expense<br />\nA student security patrol, however,<br />\nwould be preposterous if the University<br />\nhad extra money to spend on such<br />\nfrivolity; with its current financial crisis,<br />\nit is the height of absurdity. Unarmed,<br />\nuntrained, and inexperienced, a student<br />\npatrol would still have to be equipped<br />\nwith uniforms and two-way radios;<br />\nsalaries would constitute another<br />\nexpense. The University should not waste<br />\nmoney and other resources on an<br />\namateurish venture of this nature. Police<br />\nwork, if worthwhile, is a professional<br />\nactivity. A student patrol would merely<br />\ndelay again the necessary upgrading of.<br />\nthe primary campus patrol force, while<br />\nexposing the student participants to<br />\nexcessive danger and allowing all other<br />\nmembers of the University community no<br />\nreal increase in safety.<br />\nPositive Steps<br />\nThe University should take some<br />\nOositive steps which have not, apparently.<br /><br />\n....mdowt<br /><br />\n4.

There willsbe a special<br />\nbox in Annapolis if you insist on it<br />\nstaying there and getting an Annapolis<br />\npostmark, but apparently it will take<br />\nlonger for your letter to be delivered.<br />\nThat's the plan, Annapolis to Baltimore<br />\nto Annapolis.<br />\nOne of the \"Employees Only\" doors<br /><br />\nopened for us, but once at the guts of the<br />\nbuilding, we had to adjust to a few things.<br />\nThere are no windows, there are<br />\nthousands of flourescent lights, there's a<br />\nlot of noise, and some incredibly big<br />\nchunks of machinery are all over. This<br />\nwas the sack sorting room, and Mr.<br />\nDemetriades was kind enough to take us<br />\non the inspectors' gallery. You can see an<br />\nawful lot of TV monitors, which mean<br />\nthere are cameras watching an awful lot<br />\nof people from somewhere.

For almost<br />\nMcGovern's integrity and courage four months. McGovern ran himself<br />\nsuffered such a humiliating defeat, and ragged trying to make some headway. But<br />\nfrustration that those of us who worked it was like banging his head against the<br />\nlike hell to elect McGovern made so little wall. He never \"turned the corner,\" as did<br />\nimpact in over two months of Humphrey. He never got the American<br />\npeople to even open their ears and their<br />\ncampaigning.<br />\nI don't know why the commentators minds to the issue he presented.

In response render any real discussion of the issues<br />\nto the Nixon landslide (two words never impossible.<br />\nDid Nixon ever discuss the issues? Or<br />\nmeant to exist side-by-side), I am<br />\nsomewhat inclined to agree with those did he rely on his henchmen and his<br />\nelitists who maintain that the interests of repugnant T.V. commercials to distort<br />\ngovernment are ill-served by extension of the issues?

As if that weren't enough, the<br />\nEagleton thing had to happen. It hung<br />\nlike a cloud over the campaign and acted<br />\nto hamper any progress McGovern could<br />\nhave made.<br />\nNoble intention, bad politics<br />\nI do not mean to absolve McGovern<br />\nfrom any guilt for the debacle which has<br />\njust occurred. He was obviously not the<br />\nchoice of the rank-and-file Democrats<br />\nwho have provided the muscle of the<br />\nparty for the last few decades. Not that<br />\nhis ideas were all that different from<br />\nKennedy's or Muskie's; he just made so<br />\nlittle effort to finesse them and present<br />\nthem in a less threatening manner. Quite<br />\nto the contrary. McGovern ran for<br />\nPresident and actually told people what<br />\nhe wanted to do. Noble intention, bad<br />\npolitics.<br />\nI know McGovern came across as a<br />\nweak and \"wishy-washy\" personality to<br />\nmany Americans who value virility more<br />\nthan principle. But it was his guts which<br />\nwon me over last spring. The remark of<br />\nhis which remains with me is, \"I am fed<br />\nup with old men dreaming up wars for<br />\nyoung men to die in.\" One thing 1972 proved was that the<br />\nconventional wisdom regarding politics is<br />\nsubstantially correct. The votes are in the<br />\ncenter and McGovern is the \"Goldwater<br />\nof the Left.\" The Republicans learned<br />\nfrom the Goldwater defeat and went on<br />\nto win the Presidency the next time<br />\naround. I am confident that, in this<br />\nrespect, history will repeat itself. The new<br />\nslogan - to borrow a page from the<br />\nRepublicans- \"Only Four More Years 'Til<br />\n'76!\"<br /><br />\nsays, \"yes sir.\" (Gene, why don't you<br />\nmove over so these men can get a picture<br />\nof you at the console.) Aerojet-General<br />\nCorporation was the name on one of the<br />\ncontrol panels, and I think they<br />\nmanufactured everything in the room<br />\nexcept for us. It all works so well.<br />\nThe really disturbing section, the part<br />\nwhich truly ties people to the machines,<br />\nis where they sort letters. There are<br />\nmaybe seventy people, each in front of a<br />\nconsole. A mechanical arm puts a letter in<br />\nfront of them once every second, and<br />\nthey have to punch out the last three<br />\ndigits of the zip code on a keyboard.<br />\nSixty letters a minute, or they can't hold<br />\nthe job. They do this for eight hours a<br />\nday, and thirty minutes of every hour is<br />\nspent sweeping up the letters that the<br />\nmachines drop. They drop alot of them<br />\nbecause it's all done so quickly. (Where<br />\nya71 from? Hopkins. You going to do a<br />\nstory on us? Yeah.) The shifts are<br />\nstaggered, so bells go off every few<br />\nminutes to get the people moving and at<br />\ntheir places. This is not General Motors;<br />\nthis is the government. It's a post office,<br />\nnot a factory. The distinctions fade. It's a<br />\nletter factory.<br />\nOne of the toys the supervisors have in<br />\nthe room is a dial that's ,connected to a<br />\nlarge scale-type meter, numbered from<br />\none to seventy-five. The pointer was set<br />\njust a little above the sixty mark, and Mr.<br />\nDemetriades looked at it and said,<br />\n\"Everyday they make a gain.\" Sixty<br />\nletters a minute, remember?, Modern<br />\nTimes.<br />\nWe didn't talk to any of the employees<br />\nin this area (Please don't cross the painted<br />\nyellow line.), but Mr. Demetriades took<br />\nus into his confidence as we watched a<br />\ngroup of people hand sorting letters<br />\nwithout zip codes. \"Now, these people<br />\naren't very fast. (Hi, how ya doing?<br />\nGood, thanks.) They tend to talk which<br />\nslows them down. You see - they've seen<br />\nus watching, and that's going to distract<br />\nthem even more.\" There are already some<br />\nsolutions for their problem: \"We've<br />\nemployed about one hundred deaf-mutes,<br />\nand they do a terrific job. They aren't<br />\ndistracted so easily. On those machines,<br />\nthey're faster than the people who have<br />\nall their faculties.\" Later on we passed<br />\none of the secretaries in the hall, and it<br />\nwas whispered that she was blind. \"She<br />\ndoes a great job. Our handicapped people<br />\nhave worked out very well.\" We did hear<br />\nthat the deaf workers were kept separate<br />\nfrom each other because that kept them<br />\nfrom using sign language. What a<br />\nwonderful, wonderful place to work,<br />\nespecially if you're a machine or can act<br />\nlike one for a few hours every day.<br />\n\"The Post Office has really progressed<br />\nwith technology,\" we were told. What's<br /><br />\ndisturbing is that the Post Office is proud,<br />\nso proud of the totality of the building<br />\nthat they don't worry about the crap<br />\npeople have to put up with to make it<br />\noperate.<br />\nThere is a sign on one of the 'file<br />\ncabinets in Mr. Demetriades' office.<br />\n\"Customer service comes first with me.\"<br />\nI'm sure that he and the Baltimore<br />\nPostmaster genuinely try to serve that<br />\nprinciple, but maybe they made the<br />\nwrong kind of sacrifices in serving it.<br />\nBefore we left the building, Mr.<br />\nDemetriades asked if we would send him<br />\na few copies of whatever articles we<br />\nwrote. \"Send five or six if they're really<br />\ngood. The Postmaster will want to send<br />\nthem on up.\" I just don't know what I<br />\nshould say. How could he have possibly<br />\nknown?

In that memorable<br />\nencounter, Dickinson led 21-0 at<br />\nthe half and 28-22 with 50<br />\nseconds to play, before Jack<br /><br />\nThomas ran ten yards for a<br />\nHopkins touchdown and a /9-18<br />\nvictory.<br />\nDickinson has many returning<br />\nlettermen this year, and they<br />\ncertainly haven't forgotten their<br />\nlast confrontation with the Blue<br />\nJays. With that memory still<br />\nfresh in their minds, the Devils<br />\nshould be an even tougher<br />\nadversary.<br />\nEven without this added<br />\nincentive; Dickinson would<br />\nhardly be considered a<br />\n\"pushover.\u2014 Their effective<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTIER<br /><br />\nspoRTs<br />\nNetmen promise'different look'<br />\nBy STEVE BROWN<br />\nOn Thursday, November 30th,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nbasketball season opens. The<br />\nBlue Jays drew Towson State for<br />\nthe opening round of the Schafer<br />\nMetro Tournament. Presently,<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert is in the<br />\nprocess of conditioning and<br />\ndrilling his thirteen man squad in<br />\nan attempt to ready them for a<br />\nlong and trying season.<br />\nThe 1972-3 team promises to<br />\nshow a different look. Coach<br />\nRupert is blessed with more<br />\nspeed, scoring punch, height and<br />\ndesire. In the past, comparatively<br />\nsmall teams forced coaches into<br />\nball control strategies. However,<br />\na strong bench and \"a lot of guys<br />\nof equal ability\" will allow the<br />\nteam to play an exciting, wide<br />\nopen brand of basketball this<br />\nyear with a fast break offense, a<br />\npressing defense and more<br />\nrunning than ever before.<br />\nThe strategy for this season<br />\nwill be to utilize effectively all<br />\nthirteen players and, therefore,<br />\nwear down opponents. Since<br />\nthere is not much difference in<br />\nthe abilities of many of the<br />\nplayers, frequent substitutions<br />\nwill enable five fresh ballplayers<br />\nto be on the court at all times.<br />\nThe team is young, with only<br />\none senior, but three starting<br />\njuniors all have a year's experience<br />\nunder their belts. Five fine<br />\nsophomores up from last year's<br />\n11-2 freshman team and one<br />\nfreshman round out the squad.<br />\nCoach Rupert has welcomed<br />\nthe competitive spirit and<br />\nenthusiasm of each practice with<br />\nopen arms. The second five fills<br />\nbeen pushing the starters, thus<br />\nproviding the competition which<br />\nwill eventually benefit everyone<br /><br />\nin the end.<br />\nJohn Rutter and Bobby<br />\nFreedman, both guards, are the<br />\nteam's co-captains. They are<br />\njuniors and returning starters<br />\nfrom last year's team. Coach<br />\nRupert sees them as \"exceptional<br />\nleaders,\" and ability-wise, they<br />\nare playing the best they ever<br />\nhave. Rutter is the quarterback<br />\non the court, and Bobby.plays a<br />\nsound offensive and defensive<br />\ngame.<br />\nSurprise!<br />\nChuck LaBerge, at 6'5\", has<br />\nbeen 41 surprise to many. After<br />\nworking hard for the entire<br />\nsummer, Chuck came back tc<br />\nschool willing and ready to play.<br />\nThe 6'7\" Bill Jews is also back<br />\nfrom last year's starting quintet.<br />\nAlthough a potential superstar,<br />\nit's all a matter of consisten-cy<br />\nand desire with Jews. Right now<br />\nhe is playing super ball, and is<br />\nalmost impossible to stop.<br />\nPaul Spence, a 6'1\"<br />\nsophomore, is the only<br />\nnewcomer to the varsity who is<br />\nstarting. Spence, last year's<br />\nfreshman phenomenon, has been<br />\ntabbed \"a super ballplayer\" by<br />\nRupert. He is a great shooter and<br />\nan unselfish player, and also led<br />\nhis freshman team in scoring and<br />\nassists.<br />\nForward Freshmen<br />\nJoining Spence from the<br />\nfreshmen team are forwards Greg<br />\nDeLong, Tom Davis and Andy<br />\nWalder, and guard Andy<br />\nSchrieber. At 6'4\" DeLong and<br />\nWalder are strong rebounders and<br />\ngood shooters. The 6'3\" Davis is<br />\nan excellent outside shooter and<br />\na fine driver. Schrieber, although<br />\nonly 6'1\", is probably the best<br />\nleaper on the team and extremely<br />\nfast.<br /><br />\nAlso returning from last year's<br />\nvarsity are Glen Rasin and Doug<br />\nCampbell, both guards. Campbell<br />\nhas become more aggressive and<br />\nis no longer hesitant of shooting.<br />\nRasin proved his worth as a floor<br />\ngeneral when he chipped in at the<br />\nend of last season.<br />\nThe only two who didn't play<br />\nbasketball at Johns Hopkins last<br />\nyear also happens to be the only<br />\nsenior and the only freshman on<br />\nthis year's squad. Al Robinson, a<br />\nsenior guard, had trouble with his<br />\nknees and sat out last season.<br />\nHowever, he is very quick and<br />\nprobably the best defensive<br />\nplayer on the team. Freshman<br />\nDrew Fender is coach Rupert's<br />\n\"pleasant surprise.\" At 6'S\" he is<br />\naggressive, a good shooter and<br />\nshot blocker, and an excellent<br />\nrebounder.<br /><br />\nmultiple offense is led by star<br />\nquarterback Jeff Truskey, whom<br />\nHopkins Coach Denny Cox calls<br />\n\"another Jack Thomas.\" Like<br />\nThomas, Truskey can both run<br />\nand pass and, most importantly,<br />\nis an extremely \"heady\" signal<br />\ncaller. As Dickinson's principle<br />\nthreat, he is \"the man we have to<br />\nstop,\" according to Coach Cox.<br />\nTruskey is not without help,<br />\nhowever, because the Devils have<br />\nan outst a ndi ng pass-catching<br />\nthreat in flanker Mark Lipstein,<br />\nwhom Cox considers \"one of the<br />\nbest receivers in the MAC.\"<br />\nAnother man to watch is tailback<br />\nGerry Urich, the Devils' leading<br />\nrusher, who runs through holes<br />\nopened by an offensive line that<br />\ndverages over 200 pounds.<br />\nDickinson is not quite as<br />\nstrong defensively as offensively,<br />\nbut, in Cox's words, \"They get<br />\nthe job done.\" Standouts among<br />\nthe defenders are safetymen Jim<br />\nSlobozien and Craig Bornholm,<br />\nand linebackers Gene Sienkiewicz<br />\nand Bill Stabert.<br />\nThe Blue Jays are not without<br />\nincentives of their own, however,<br />\nbecause they have yet to win two<br />\ngames in a row this season, and<br />\nare striving for a back-to-back<br />\nconsistent performances. And<br />\nwhile this is not the Blue Jays'<br />\nlast game of the year, it is their<br />\nfinal home contest, and they<br />\nwould like nothing better than to<br />\nwin their remaining two games to<br />\nduplicate last year's 6-3 record.<br />\nAccording to Coach Cox,\"the<br />\nkeys to victory are an absence of<br />\nturnovers and solid hard-hitting<br />\nall over the field.\" Consistency is<br />\nhoped for, and, in the Coach's<br />\nwords, \"Our defense is going to<br />\nhave to do another good job.\"<br />\nTomorrow is the last chance for<br />\nHopkins students to cheer them<br />\nin that effort.<br /><br />\nthe Blue Jay cross country team<br />\ntravels to Mt. St. Mary's College<br />\nin western Maryland for that<br />\nschool's annual invitational meet.<br />\nThe meet, \u2022which originally<br />\ninvited only teams from the<br />\nnorthern part of the<br />\nMason-Dixon conference, is an<br />\nall-area invitational and includes<br />\nteams from across the Free State<br />\nand several from Pennsylvania.<br />\nThe Mount is a perrenial<br />\nfavorite, although they did not<br />\nwin last year. Hopkins' stiffest<br />\ncompetition will probably be<br />\nfrom Gettysburg and Towson on<br />\na team basis; while freshman<br />\nGordon Oliver of Mt. St. Mary's<br />\nis favored to win the individual<br />\ntitle.<br />\nSpiked Shoe<br />\nOliver, a graduate of<br />\nBethesda-Chevy Chase High<br />\nSchool,, won the Hopkins Spiked<br />\nShoe meet and last year won the<br />\nhigh school section of the two<br />\nmile run at the Penn Relays.<br />\nThe entire day will be devoted<br />\nto cross country as there will be:<br />\nraces in the high school,<br />\ncollegiate, and open divisions.<br />\nThe college division features a<br />\n5.2 mile race with barriers of hay<br />\nto give the race more of a<br />\nresemblance to a real<br />\ncross-country competition.<br />\nAccording to Coach Masken,<br />\n\"This is going to be a<br />\ncross-country day and I'm sure<br />\nthere will be good competition at<br />\nall levels. The barriers should also<br />\nhelp to add a little more zest to<br />\nthe race.How Fare<br />\nHopkins plans to take its seven<br />\ntop placers from the conference<br />\nmeet on the sixth, which were<br />\nDoyle, Dubiel, Greves, Higdon,<br />\nPerrone, Tetzlaff, and Van Dyke.<br />\nAsked how he thinks the tearn<br />\nwill fare the coach commented,<br />\n\"After the championships there's<br />\nusually a let down because it's as<br />\nif the season is over.

The<br />\nClippers, drained each year by<br />\nNHL clubs, had the unwanted.<br />\ndistinction of being a harvesting<br />\nground for the newly formed<br />\nWorld Hockey Association. The<br />\nresult is that only seven players<br />\nremain from last year's edition<br />\nwhich battled tooth and nail in<br />\nsix games with the Nova Scotia<br />\nVoyageurs for the Calder Cup.<br />\nThis year's veteran returnees<br />\ninclude goalie Jim Shaw,<br />\nforwards Jim Bartlett, Brian<br />\nMurphy, Bob Rivard, Marc<br />\nDufour, and defensemen Jim<br />\nMorrison and Wally Chevrier.<br />\nSince Murphy, Rivard and<br />\nDufour all consitute one line, the<br />\nmost potent, Clipper fans have<br />\nalready been dismayed at the<br />\nteam's lack of harmony, as well<br />\nas firepower.<br />\nWhen the Clippers opened up<br />\ntheir season impressively,<br />\nsplitting their first three games,<br />\nall on the road, the Rivard,<br />\nMurphy, Dufour trio erupted for<br />\nan astounding 20 points.<br />\nHowever, when the Clippers<br />\nSkidded through a three game<br />\nlosing streak, the unit was hardly<br />\nnoticed.<br />\nPeople were beginning to<br />\nwonder what happened to the<br />\nClipper attack, particularly when<br />\nthe Clippers consistently failed to<br /><br />\nconvert in \"power play\"<br />\nsituations. Then Murphy and<br />\nRivard each scored against<br />\nCincinnati, Murphy lit the lamp<br />\ntwice more in a 2-2 tie at<br />\nCleveland, Dufour scored the hat<br /><br />\ntrick in Sunday's 74 loss at<br />\nProvidence, and Murphy tallied<br />\ntwice more in Tuesday's 7-4<br />\nvictory over Springfield. The real<br />\nproblem is whether one line is<br />\nenough to supply the Clipper's<br /><br />\noffense, and if not, why anyone<br />\nelse hasn't picked up the slack.<br />\nPerhaps the case o'f Jim Bartlett<br />\nmight provide some clue.<br />\nIn a league that guarantees a<br />\nyear by year turnover of each<br /><br />\nteam's roster, Jim Bartlett has<br />\nturned out to be an invaluable<br />\npossession. But even the Clippers'<br />\nseven year veteran, famous for<br />\nhis wild emotional outbursts that<br />\ncould singlehandedly reverse the<br />\nmomentum of a game, had failed<br />\nin recent encounters to generate<br />\nany noise with his stick.<br />\nPrior to last Wednesday's game<br />\nat Richmond,\"Black Bart\", as he<br />\nis affectionately called by his<br />\nteammates, had scored only five<br />\ngoals, three of which came in the<br />\nsame game. Other than that,<br />\nBartlett had compiled only four<br />\nassists in the first twelve games of<br />\nthe season. Perhaps, it is too<br />\nearly in the season for Bartlett,<br />\nwho saves his greatest<br />\nperformances for pressure<br />\npacked, back against the wall<br />\nsituations, like his hat trick in the<br />\ndivision clinching game against<br />\nRochester last year.<br />\nThe question is how long one<br />\nmust wait for the Clippers'<br />\ncolorful left-wing to return to his<br />\nold form, and whether this is the<br />\nsame hockey player that led the<br />\nClippers in scoring in the<br />\n1969-70 season. Only Bartlett<br />\ncan provide the answers.<br />\nIf the attack is erratic right<br />\nnow, the defense must deal with<br />\nan entirely different problem.<br />\nThe ageless Jim Morrison, now in<br />\nhis 21st season, and veteran<br />\nWally Chevrier rely heavily on<br />\nexperiences, something that<br />\ncannot match up to the early<br />\nseason speed of younger<br />\nperformers. At age 41, one<br />\nwonders how long Morrison can<br />\nkeep it up. But the former NHL<br />\nveteran has seen a lot of players<br />\ncome and go, and if he keeps in<br />\nshape, he will see a lot more.

His Blue Jays had just lost,<br />\n'<br />\n2 1, to Western Maryland, and in<br />\nhis eyes, one<br />\ncould see an entire<br />\nYear of<br />\ndisappointment, of six<br />\nfrustrating one goal losses that<br />\nhave made a<br />\nmockery of a good<br />\nteam.<br />\nAs usual,<br />\nHopkins completely<br />\ndo minated the<br />\nlast 3 quarters of<br />\nthe<br />\ngame. Frank Curnoles was<br />\nextraordinary<br />\nin the midfield,<br />\ncontrolling<br />\nthe ball skillfully and<br />\nProviding his mates with plenty<br />\nof room to<br />\nmaneuver. He<br />\nreceived ample help from<br />\nfullbacks<br />\nJoe Rutkowski and<br />\nAndy Smith and inside Mark<br /><br />\nManzione, all of whom played<br />\ncreatively and intelligently.<br />\nUnfortunately, the attack a, as<br />\nit had done all season, collapsed<br />\ninside the Green Terror penalty<br />\narea. Time and again, sustained<br />\nthrusts were thwarted by by<br />\ncareless passes made either too<br />\nquickly or too late, and by<br />\ngrossly inaccurate shooting.<br />\nDuring the first half, Western<br />\nMaryland was going downhill on<br />\ntheir sloping pitch with the wind<br />\nat their backs. They used this<br />\nadvantage cleverly and scored on<br />\ntheir first chance. Fullback Hall,<br />\nwho was outstanding throughout,<br />\nintercepted a pass at midfield and<br />\nfloated one that sent Wilcock in<br />\nalone. Goalie Keith Naunheim<br />\ncharged a little hesitantly but<br />\nWilcock made the mistake<br />\nacademic with a thundering shot<br /><br />\nThe goal came at the 7.55<br />\nmark and the Terrors added<br />\n'another only 16 seconds later.<br />\nAgain Hall intercepted and sent<br />\nWilcock on a semi-breakaway.<br />\nNaunheim came out for the first<br />\nsave but it rebounded to Ilupejt<br />\nwho had an open n.t.

Consequently, the<br />\nlimits of post-election\" analysis<br />\nare much more clearly defined<br />\nthan the almost limitless range of<br />\npre-election inquiry. Now we<br />\nmust deal with the definitive<br />\nelection results and try to<br />\nunderstand what these figures<br />\ninfer concerning the current<br />\nelectoral composition, shifts in<br />\ntraditional consistency, and the<br />\nestablishment of possible trends.<br />\nEven though we lack the<br />\nanalytical expertise of the<br />\npolitical scientists, we can still<br />\ndissect a little of what happened<br />\nlast Tuesday.<br />\nIt is clear by now (if it wasn't<br />\nby 7:30 Tuesday night) that<br />\nPresident Nixon was re-elected<br />\nby landslide proportions. At last<br />\ncount, Nixon had received 60.8%<br />\nof the popular vote which still<br />\nleaves former President Lyndon<br />\nJohnson holding the trophy with<br />\n61.1% in his landslide victory<br />\nover Senator Barry Goldwater in<br />\n1964. Nixon also received 521<br />\nelectoral votes, well over the 270<br />\nneeded for re-election. If we stop<br />\nhere, if you turned your tubes<br />\noff at 7:30, it appears that the<br />\nelection was anything but close;<br />\nthat Nixon received a sweeping<br />\nmandate; that conservatism is on<br />\nthe rise in America. If we go<br />\nbeyond the presidential election<br />\nresults, however, we find that the<br />\nelection was quite close, that<br />\nNixon's sweeping mandate was<br />\nnothing more than a \"lonely<br />\nlandslide,\" that moderation and<br />\neven liberalism faired quite well.<br />\nI speak, of course, of the<br />\nCongressional and gubernatorial<br />\ncontests. Many commentators<br />\nhad conceded Nixon's re-election<br />\nearly Tuesday evening. Their<br />\nprimary realm of discussion was<br />\nhow extensive the \"coattail<br /><br />\neffect\" would be ,and how many<br />\ncandidates in Congressional and<br />\nstate races would be swept into<br />\noffice by a Nixon landslide. Clark<br />\nMacGregor, the CREEP<br />\n(Committee to Re-elect the<br />\nPresident) Director, was<br />\nconvinced that a Republican<br />\ntakeover in Congress would result<br />\nin a Nixon landslide of 60<br />\npercent or more. Now that the<br />\nresults are in, it appears that<br />\nRepublican candidates had<br />\ntrouble grabbing the President's<br />\nundershirt much less his coattails.<br />\nThe congressional and<br />\ngubernatorial elections show just<br />\nhow personal and nonpartisan<br />\nPresident Nixon's victory is. The<br />\nGOP picked up only 13 House<br />\nseats, 8 of which are in the<br />\nSouth. The GOP Congressional<br />\ndelegation will be no better (in<br />\nnumbers) than the one they<br />\nfielded in 1967. In the Senate,<br />\nthe GOP managed to do the<br />\nincredible by actually showing a<br />\nnet loss of two seats. Senators<br />\nMiller (Iowa), Smith (Maine),<br /><br />\nAllott (Colorado), and Boggs<br />\n(Delaware), all considered safe<br />\nRepublican seats, lost to their<br />\nDemocratic Challengers. The<br />\nDemocrats also picked up retiring<br />\nRepublican seats in Kentucky<br />\nand South Dakota. In these six<br />\nSt ates President Nixon's total<br />\nvote ranged from 54 percent in<br />\nSouth Dakota to .64% in<br />\nKentucky. His underlings faired 5<br />\nto 20 percentage points lower.<br />\nEven where the GOP picked up<br />\nfour seats (Oklahoma, North<br />\nCarolina, New Mexico, and<br />\nVirginia), their vote totals wer<br />\nstill embarrassing. The most any<br />\ncandidate could muster in these<br />\nfour states was 54% while<br />\nPresident Nixon didn't slip under<br />\n62%. After gleaning over these<br />\nresults, even the director of the<br />\nRepublican Senate Election<br />\nCommittee was prompted to<br />\nadmit that there was no coattail<br />\neffect.<br />\nIn the gubernatorial election,<br />\nthe results are the same.
