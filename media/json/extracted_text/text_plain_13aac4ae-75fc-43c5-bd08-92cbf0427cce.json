M. C.<br />\nA., Makes Stiring Appeal lo<br />\nHopkins Men.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins climbed the first rung<br />\nof the ladder for the State championship when she triumphed in a<br />\nhard-fought contest over the srcappy and fast Western Maryland<br />\nteam on Saturday by the score of<br />\n9 to 0. The lion's share of the<br />\ncredit for the victory goes to 011ie<br />\nWhislow, who took the starch out<br />\nof the Upstaters with a beautiful<br />\n40-yard goal from placement in<br />\nthe first few minutes of play, who<br />\nskirted the ends time and again<br />\nfor Hopkins' most substantial<br />\ngains, and who piloted the team<br />\nthrough a trying contest with<br />\nmasterly skill and judgment. The<br />\nHopkins team packed a real, driving punch and, for ilie first time<br />\nthis year, came through with flying colors. It was a great victory<br />\nand the stage was all set for it.<br />\nThe Hopkins battalion, in olive<br />\ndrab, in full force, aird preceded<br />\nby a fancy brass band, paraded to<br />\nHomewood field where they manoeuvered as a preliminary attraction to the big show. The student<br />\nbody of Western Maryland was<br />\nnot to be outdone and was there<br />\nwith its band. The largest crowd<br />\nof the year, numbering about four<br />\nthousand, filled the stands and<br />\nlined the field.<br />\nThe Hopkins Machine worked<br />\nsmoothly and steadily under the<br />\nguiding hand of their clever quarter, and at times exhibited flashes<br />\nthat recalled the old steam-roller<br />\ndays of 1915. Winslow drove the<br />\nteam at top speed and had them<br />\nfighting harder than ever before<br />\nand personally contributed liberally to the success of the team.<br />\nWoodward, Carey and Jones also<br />\ncame in for their share of the<br />\nhonors. The Hopkins captain outpunted his rival by many yards,<br />\nbooting the ball for flights that<br />\naveraged 50 yards. Carey, who<br />\nmade Hopkins' only score last<br />\nweek, is rapidly developing into a<br />\nstar half-back ; with a burst of<br />\nspeed and force, he consistently<br />\nbored his way through the Green<br />\nand Gold line, and finally carried<br />\nthe ball over the line for the lone<br />\ntouchdown. Jones, on account of<br />\na bad leg, was not given too much<br />\nwork, but whenever he was given<br />\nthe ball, the \"Speed-the-plough\"<br />\ndemon delivered the goods. The<br />\nline, although it had the advantage in weight, did not play up to<br />\nusual form, and for that reason<br />\nthe Western Maryland team was<br />\nalways ,dangerous.<br />\nHopkins jumped into the game<br />\nwith a dash that swept the Methodists off their feet, scoring in<br />\n<br />\nThat a\" constitution correlating<br />\nall the activities of the University<br />\nbe immediately drawn up was the<br />\ndecision of the Student Council at<br />\nits regular monthly meeting last<br />\nMonday night. A committee was<br />\nappointed to communicate with<br />\nthe governing student organizations of other Universities in regard to their methods of relating<br />\nthe branches of student interests,<br />\nas well as to make a thorough<br />\nstudy of our own activities and<br />\nlie proper manner of co-ordinating<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe student council then turned<br />\nits attention to the all-important<br />\nquestion of hazing. After much<br />\ndiscussion it was decided to delegate to the \"Pep committee\" of the<br />\nSophomore Class the power both<br />\nto conduct a roll-call of the freshmen at each football game, and to<br />\npass upon the excuses for absence.<br />\nAll excuses which this committee<br />\nconsiders unsatisfactory are then<br />\nreported to the Student Council<br />\nfor recommendation as to the best<br />\nmethod for dealing with the offender. Completing this important phase of the question, the<br />\nCouncil took up the subject of<br />\nhazing in general. This body felt<br />\nupon the conclusion of the discussion that the attitude of the<br />\nlower classes did not appear to be<br />\nexactly the proper one,as all forms<br />\nof pure hazing have long since<br />\nbeen abolished at Hopkins, and<br />\nthere remains only the rudimentary forms serving as penalties for<br />\ndisobedience to the regulations.<br />\nIn order to correct this improper<br />\nconception, it was decided to send<br />\nrepresentatives to the next meeting of the lower classes.<br />\nA particularly flagrant case of<br />\nutter disregard of all regulations<br />\nhaving been summoned before the<br />\nCouncil was then giving a hearing. Yaffe, '21, speaking in his<br />\nown defense, noted as extenuating<br />\ncircumstance the fact that he had<br />\nattended another institution for<br />\ntwo weeks and while there he had<br />\ncomplied with the regulations. It<br />\nwas admitted, however, upon crossexamination that he knew of the<br />\nrequirement in the University requiring all students to obey the<br />\nfreshmen regulations until they<br />\nshall have completed one semester<br />\nin either this cir another University. The Council finally decided<br />\nthe defendant guilty of breaking<br />\nthe regulations, and as a penalty<br />\nwill compel him to obey them during both semesters.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nHITS<br />\n<br />\nHER<br />\n<br />\nSTRIDE<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nThe Western Maryland Game<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 7,(ol. 1)<br />\n<br />\nApproximately s800 has been<br />\nraised as a result of a campaign<br />\nfor the Students' Friendship War<br />\nFund held on Thursday and Friday of last week at the University under the auspices of the Y.<br />\nM. C. A. A million dollars is being raised for this fund throughout all the colleges of the country,<br />\nand up to the time of this article<br />\ngoing to press, the above amount<br />\nhas been subscribed at Hopkins,<br />\nwith 300 of the student body yet<br />\nunheard from. A central committee was gotten together earlier in<br />\nthe week, and the need was presented to them, with the result<br />\nthat the twenty-seven men in that<br />\nsmall group pledged themselves<br />\nfor over $540.<br />\nThis central<br />\ngroup was organized into committees, a certain number of men<br />\nto each class, and the campaign<br />\nproper was started at a massmeeting on Thursday noon, with a<br />\ntalk by Mr. David Porter, secretary of the central board of the<br />\nV. M. C. A.<br />\nMr. Porter said in opening that<br />\nhe thought this was the most momentous proposal ever brought before the University. \"We hear so<br />\nmuch of the five millions of men<br />\nwho are lying wounded in the hospitals of Europe, and we know<br />\nwhat those men have sacrificed<br />\nand are sacrificing for the common<br />\ncause of us all. We too must<br />\nlearn what sacrificing means,<br />\nwhen these men,some of them now<br />\nour friends, cousins and brothers,<br />\nare sacrificing so much.\"<br />\nThere are more than six million<br />\nmen in the prison camps of Europe today, and Mr. Porter then<br />\ntold of the conditions under which<br />\nmost of those men are living; their<br />\nquarters being low huts without<br />\nany artificial heat, enclosed on all<br />\nsides by barbed wire and machine<br />\nguns, with the men's cots built up<br />\nin tiers three deep. Many of these<br />\nmen are college students and high<br />\nschool graduates accustomed to<br />\nluxury.<br />\nThe speaker stated that one of<br />\nthe worst features of the life in<br />\nthese prison camps is its awful<br />\ntedium, which has rendered thousands of inmates insane and has<br />\nbrought thousands more to a state<br />\nclosely bordering on insanity. Mr.<br />\nPorter recounted several incidents<br />\nin lint. He stated that it was<br />\njust this state of affairs which the<br />\nStudents' Friendship War Fund<br />\nhas.been 'organized to combat. Its<br />\npromoters hope to introduce into<br />\nthe prison camps features of an<br />\neducational and fraternal nature,<br />\n(Continued \u00b0it' page 8, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nBy COACH BRENN1CK<br />\n<br />\nThe team from Western Maryland College came to Homewood<br />\nSaturday well trained, fast and<br />\nover-brimming with confidence because of an hitherto clean slate,<br />\nas they had defeated all their previous opponents, including St.<br />\nJohn's College. Our team rose to<br />\nthe occasion, however, and by<br />\nskillful playing in the first half<br />\nsecured a lead sufficient to permit them to come out victorious.<br />\nMuch had been said of the tricky<br />\nnature of the Western Maryland<br />\nattack, but it was very manifest<br />\nthat it was not by tricks that they<br />\nmade their notable advances, but<br />\nrather by a well-planned and wellexecuted series of line plunges. In<br />\nfootball, as in life, tricks do not<br />\navail one much if the good, hard<br />\nwork on fundamentals and the exercise of the intelligence are neglected.<br />\nThe team is entitled to a great<br />\ndeal of credit for the manner in<br />\nwhich they played Saturday, because for many of them it was the<br />\nfirst championship game in which<br />\nthey had participated and each<br />\nman felt just how much was at<br />\n- stake. There is not a man on the<br />\nteam that did not give all that<br />\nwas in him, and it must have<br />\npleased Hopkins men to see their,<br />\nfor the most part, untried fellows<br />\nstop such a sterling little player<br />\nas is Keller, for his skill in all of<br />\nhis previous games has been most<br />\nstriking. So well did each man do \u2022<br />\nhis allotted portion that it would<br />\nseem unjust to single out individuals for commendation, yet one<br />\ncannot help but praise Captain<br />\nWoodward for the way in which<br />\nhe set the pace for his men and<br />\nWinslow for his subperb generalship.<br />\nThe winning of this game by no<br />\nmeans spells perfection for the<br />\nteam, and I am sure that no one<br />\nis. more aware of this than each<br />\nmember of the squad. It is doubtful, and this is said without the<br />\nleast intention of detracting from<br />\nthe credit earned by the team Saturday, if the same sort of game<br />\nwould be enough to defeat St.<br />\nJohn's, as St. John's stands today.<br />\nIt is of course a fact that Western Maryland defeated St. John's,<br />\nbut all of us know only too well<br />\nthat facts and logic often go<br />\nawry when applied to a St. John'sHopkins game. From now until<br />\nNovember 24 every effort will be<br />\nmade to so perfect our play that<br />\non the evening of that day we<br />\nmay be one game nearer the<br />\nchampionship than we now are.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, NOVEMBER 12, 1917.<br />\n<br />\nFURNITURE OF QUALITY<br />\nand individuality is offered here at prices that are not<br />\nand cannot be underquoted by any house at any time.<br />\n11 Besides, the reputation of an old-established firm is<br />\nback of each sale with a guarantee.<br />\n<br />\nJohn C.

He also very earnestly asked that the men give<br />\ntheir full support to the battalion<br />\ndance.<br />\nThe meeting was then turned<br />\nover to the battalion, and Captain<br />\nBitter urged that every man see<br />\nto it that he carries himself with<br />\na soldierly bearing, whether in<br />\nuniform or not. Captain Baxley<br />\nnext brought up the subject of the<br />\nbattalion dance.

He made it plain<br />\nthat the Hopkins uniform should<br />\nbe distinctive and respected in<br />\nevery way. Especially, he said,<br />\nuniforms should always be kept<br />\nneat and clean.<br />\nFollowing the talks of the officers, first sergeants Simon and<br />\nSmith each treated the subject of<br />\nsaluting, the former urging that<br />\nthe battalion adopt the custom of<br />\nsaluting the battalion officers and<br />\nthe latter presenting the question<br />\nof saluting professors.<br />\nAfter these talks a committee<br />\nof three men from each company<br />\nwas elected to draw up a set of<br />\npolicies and present them to the<br />\nbattalion for adoption.

C.)<br />\n<br />\nWhen the call to national service<br />\narose, spirited young men everywhere of course wanted to be employed in a patriotic way, and I<br />\nsuppose there is scarcely a young<br />\nman in any college in the country<br />\nwho has not very anxiously addressed to himself the question:<br />\n\"What can I do?\"<br />\nI think that there is no general<br />\nanswer to this question. Even in<br />\nthose cases where it would be obviously better for a young men to<br />\nstay at college and prepare himself for later and fuller usefulness;<br />\nyet if the young man in so doing<br />\nacquires a low view of his own<br />\ncourage, and feels that he was<br />\nelecting the less worthy course, the<br />\neffect on the young man of that<br />\nstate of mind toward his own actions probably would be so prejudicial that it ought not to be encouraged.<br />\nTo the extent that the men<br />\nin college are physically disqualified, or .to the extent that they<br />\nare too young to meet the requirements of the department, it seems<br />\nquite clear that in the present<br />\nstate of the emergency their major usefulness lies in remaining<br />\nin the college, going forward with<br />\ntheir academic work. The knowledge that the students will acquire at college will equip them<br />\nfor subsequent usefulness if the<br />\nemergency lasts until their call<br />\ncomes.<br />\nBut we do not want to chill enthusiasm. We want to preserve<br />\nenthusiasm and cultivate it and<br />\nuse it; but we do want to be discriminating in our enthusiasm,<br />\nand prevent people getting the notion that they are not helping the,<br />\ncountry unless threy do something<br />\ndifferent, which very often is not<br />\nthe case at all. The largest usefulness may come from doing the<br />\nsame thing. Now, it is not unnatural that there should be these<br />\nebullitions of feeling, this desire<br />\nto change occupation as a badge<br />\nof changed service and devotion<br />\nto ideals. Our colleges can exercise a steadying influence in this<br />\n\u2022<br />\nregard.<br />\nWe are going to have losses on<br />\nthe sea; we are going to have<br />\nlosses in battle; our communities<br />\nare going to be subjected to the<br />\nrigid discipline of multiplied personal griefs scattered all through<br />\nthe community, and we are going<br />\nto search the cause of those back<br />\nto titer foundation, and our feelings are going to be torn and our<br />\nnerves made raw. There is a place<br />\nfor physicians of public opinion<br />\nto exercise a curative impulse.<br />\nThe young men who are in our<br />\ncolleges, who go to their homes<br />\nfrom our colleges and make up a<br />\nvery large part of the direction of<br />\npublic opinion, can exercise a curative influence by preaching the<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Meets Haverford on Foreign<br />\nGrounds Saturday\u2014Has Lost Last<br />\nTwo Years\u2014Rooters to Accompany Team.<br />\n<br />\nG.

Two years ago when every<br />\nHopkins man was convinced that<br />\nCharlie Brickley had developed a<br />\nworld-beater, a goodly number<br />\nfollowed the team to the Pennsylvania institution and saw their<br />\nfavorites robbed of the game by<br />\nincompetent officials.<br />\nLast year,when the elevens were<br />\nalmost evenly matched, the Red<br />\nand White insisted on using an<br />\nillegal pass which Coach Brennick<br />\ninsisted was illegal. However, the<br />\nmen that ran the game could not<br />\nsee things that way, and the Black<br />\nand Blue went to the showers<br />\nfirmly convinced that they were<br />\nrooked again. This year both<br />\nsquads will enter the game with<br />\neven chances, and if the men that<br />\nthe central board select do not<br />\nbungle, the proverbial fur should<br />\nfly.<br />\n- ace the<br />\nThe team that will f<br />\nBlack and Blue will be very similar to the visitors from the point<br />\nof view of material. Not until the<br />\ncollege opened did the Haverford<br />\nfollowers have the least idea what<br />\nwould be the status of their team.<br />\nToday it is composed for the most<br />\npart of freshmen, only one'Varsity<br />\nman having returned to the college. Carey, the old star quarter,<br />\nhas been superseded by Leonard, a<br />\nrookie who is fast making for<br />\nhimself a slashing football name.<br />\nThe overwhelming defeat of the<br />\nHaverford eleven at the hands of<br />\nthe team that miracle man, Gilmore Dobie, has built at Annapolis does not seem near so disgraceful as the reports of each<br />\nsuccessive Navy victory float in.<br />\nThe Pennsylvanians in their annual affair with Franklin-Marshall<br />\nrolled up 14 points, while they prevented their opponents from crossing their line. The team is not as<br />\nheavy as it was in the (lays of<br />\nVan Dam and Froehlicher and is<br />\nabout an even match in weight for<br />\nthe Black and Blue.\"<br />\n<br />\nThat basket-ball and swimming<br />\nwill not be recognized as college<br />\nsports this year was the decision<br />\nof the board of the General Athletic Association at a meeting held<br />\nlast Monday night. The resolution to this effect reads: \"Owing<br />\nto the abnormal conditions existing at the University at the present time, it is the feeling of the<br />\nboard that it is impossible to recognize any minor sports this<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nThis conclusion was drawn after a long discussion on the feasibility of the Association backing<br />\nthese two popular winter sports.<br />\nPerhaps the most valid reasons<br />\noffered against recognition were<br />\nthat Hopkins has neither a gymnasium nor a pool of its own available, and hence it would not feel<br />\njustified in inviting other college<br />\nteams to compete with it. It is the<br />\nearnest deside of the board, however, that the energy which would<br />\notherwise be spent in organizing<br />\nand developing a team will be diverted to the various inter-company contests. Even though it is<br />\npossible that the swimming and<br />\nbasket-ball teams will organize independently, they will not be permitted to use the name of Johns<br />\nHopkins this year.<br />\nAlex Wolfe was elected captain<br />\nof the lacrosse team pro tempore<br />\nuntil one should be elected at a<br />\nmeeting of the squad to be called<br />\nin the near future. by Manager<br />\nThomsen.<br />\n<br />\ndoctrine of tolerance, by exemplifying the fact that it is not necessary for a nation like the United<br />\nStates, which is fighting for the<br />\nvindication of a great ideal, to<br />\ndiscolor its purpose by hatreds or<br />\nby the entertainment of any unworthy emotion.<br />\n<br />\nCOURSE IN SIGNAL ENGINEERING<br />\nMajor Guild and Dr. Kouwenhoven to<br />\nGive Instruction to Engineering<br />\nSeniors in Battalion for Commissions in Signal Corps.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Kouwenhoven, head of the<br />\ndepartment of electrical engineering, in co-operation with Major<br />\nGuild, is preparing to offer a<br />\ncourse in signal engineering which<br />\nwill be open to seniors in engineering who are members of the<br />\nUniversity battalion.

Stuart, '20.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOV. 12, 1917.<br />\nThe Student Council.<br />\n<br />\nThe Student Council has at last<br />\nshaken off its lethargy and is literally jumping into its proper<br />\nplace as the dominant and controlling body in college life. After its whirlwind round up of disobedient freshmen and others disregardful of Hopkins traditions<br />\nlast week, no student will doubt<br />\nthat he is beyond the reach of its<br />\nlong arm, but will realize that upholding the University traditions<br />\nand regulations is not only his<br />\nduty but the best policy for him<br />\nto pursue. There shall be no<br />\nquibbling hereafter on the part of<br />\nfreshmen as to whether they wear<br />\ncaps and buttons or not; that is<br />\ndefinitely understood.<br />\nBut let no one think that the<br />\nStudent Council is merely a police<br />\ncourt for offenders of the law. It<br />\nis infinitely more than that. It<br />\nis composed of men who are elected by the students and who are<br />\nworking for the best interests of<br />\nthe students. It is the recognized<br />\nmedium between the undergraduates and the faculty. The biggest<br />\nand most important of its present<br />\nchosen tasks is to frame a constitution which will establish on a<br />\nfirm basis for all time the status<br />\nof each student activity, and crystallize in the finest form many of<br />\nthe yet unwritten traditions. The<br />\ntime is at an end for one to smile<br />\nwhen the name of the Student<br />\nCouncil is mentioned. That body<br />\nis going to make itself felt in<br />\nevery line of student endeavor. It<br />\nwill be a high court of justice, a<br />\nrespected legislature and administrative body, and the champion of<br />\nHopkins traditions. It is the duty<br />\nof each one of us to become its<br />\nardent supporter.<br />\n<br />\nThe Time Is Not Ripe.<br />\n<br />\nThe decision of the Athletic<br />\nBoard not to recognize basket-ball<br />\nand swimming is undoubtedly a<br />\nhard blow to the two small groups<br />\nof enthusiasts who so earnestly<br />\npresented petitions for the official<br />\nacknowledgement of these minor<br />\nsports as forms of Hopkins athletics.<br />\nThis decision was not a hasty<br />\none by any means, but was made<br />\nafter a long discussion as to<br />\nwhether basket-ball and swimming<br />\nteams could this year take the<br />\nplace which should be accorded<br />\nthem in college activities. There<br />\nare many valid objections, and<br />\neven those who may be most disappointed by the outcome of the<br />\nboard meeting, can see the justice<br />\nof the decision.<br />\nThe obstacles may be summed<br />\nup in two sentences. In the first<br />\nplace the introduction of these<br />\nteams would be confronted by the<br />\nunsettled and abnormal conditions<br />\nwhich are manifestly handicapping the other forms of Hopkins<br />\nathletics. Furthermore, the utter<br />\nlack of facilities for staging contests would make it impossible to<br />\ncarry on these activities in a manner befitting major sports.<br />\nThe board, however, does not<br />\nwant these sports to die out as<br />\nthere is still a chance for recognition in the future. The enthusiasts can work toward their desired goal by helping to build up<br />\ninter - company and inter - class<br />\nbasket-ball and swimming, thus<br />\ngradually developing a gold mine<br />\nof material for the teams when the<br />\nproper time comes for recognition.<br />\nThe Friendship Fund.<br />\n<br />\nIn his appeal for the Students'<br />\nFriendship War Fund last week,<br />\nMr. Porter of the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nstruck a chord which should find<br />\nready response from every one of<br />\nus. It was that of opportunity for<br />\nsacrifice. We are here, most of us,<br />\nbecause we feel that we can serve<br />\nLest by being here, but that cannot<br />\nlessen the longing to be doing<br />\nsomething for the cause which lies<br />\nalways just below the surface of<br />\nour consciousness. Here is the<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nVictory!<br />\n<br />\nLast Saturday was a red-letter<br />\nday for Johns Hopkins. Not so<br />\nmuch because our team fought<br />\nstanchly and well\u2014we have come<br />\nto take that as a matter of course<br />\nthis fall\u2014but because of the spontaneous outburst of genuine college spirit shown by the student<br />\nbody.<br />\nThe outcome of last Saturday's<br />\ngame was gratifying. But had the<br />\nscore been twenty to nothing for<br />\nWestern Maryland, a notable Hopkins victory would still have been<br />\nscored. Hopkins spirit has won.<br />\nIt is here to stay.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nLiters from Alen in Service. 11<br />\n<br />\nA close view of the life at Camp<br />\nMeade is given in the following letter from \"Jack\" Mowbray,'17, sergeant in the 315th Infantry. Besides telling interesting incidents,<br />\nhe speaks of several Hopkins men.<br />\n\"Hank\" Chalmers, one of them,<br />\nwas a member of the present Senior Class, manager of baseball, a<br />\nlacrosse star and assistant general<br />\nsecretary of the Hopkins Y. M. C.<br />\nA. He is now assistant to Mr.<br />\nLindley, formerly in charge of the<br />\nY. M. C. A. work at Hopkins, and<br />\nis hoping to be sent across the<br />\nAtlantic soon for service in<br />\nFrance:<br />\nCAMP MEADE,<br />\nOctober 30, 1917.<br />\nDEAR CARROLL:<br />\nOne thing I forgot to speak of<br />\nin my last letter is the three Hopkins men who are doing their bit<br />\nhere. Do you remember Sergeant<br />\nFreelander? Well, he is captain<br />\nof Company I in our regiment,<br />\nthe 315th. He has been very nice<br />\nto us since our arrival and we recall happy days at Hopkins when<br />\npeace reigned supreme in our fair<br />\nland. (That was a nice, worn-out<br />\nphrase.) The other two are<br />\n\"Hank\" Chalmers,'18, and Mr. A.<br />\nE. Lindley, last year's collegiate<br />\nsecretary. They are both together<br />\nhere in charge of our branch Y.<br />\nM.C.A. \"Hank\" is doing very well<br />\nhere and is very popular. He is<br />\nshowing fine spirit when he knows<br />\nhe will be rejected on account of<br />\nhis eyes in the draft. He anxiously awaits orders to go across the<br />\npond and is working hard to go<br />\nover as soon as he can. It is very<br />\namusing to see him \"impersonate\"<br />\nan officer (if that is a good military term). He wears the Y. M.<br />\nC. A. uniform, which is a gray<br />\ncolor, but he covers it with a short<br />\nsheepskin-lined coat such as all<br />\nofficers here wear. Almost every<br />\nrookie salutes and \"Hank\" is as<br />\ngracious as a major-general in his<br />\nreturn.<br />\nWarner and I are now on special<br />\nduty. We are sergeants in charge<br />\nof the work done by the prisoners<br />\nin camp and their number is<br />\nlegion. You should see us directing the handling of large boxes of<br />\nrubbish, trash, etc., seated on the<br />\nwagon seat of a big army wagon.<br />\nOur pride at being sergeants far<br />\nexceeds any feelings of anticipation we might have had at Fort<br />\nMyer. A sergeant seems to be a<br />\ngreat man among real men. A<br />\nlieutenant\u2014well, why pick on such<br />\na small potato? One of the characters here is Sergeant Wheating.<br />\nHe is filling out his eleventh enlistment, i. e., his thirty-third<br />\nyear. He possesses fifty-two good<br />\nteeth and a clean record. He expects to be retired this year and<br />\npensioned on account of his long<br />\nservice.<br />\nAnother character is \"Bill\"<br />\nLupton, otherwise known as<br />\n\"Hap.\" Before he was drafted he<br />\n<br />\nhad served in the navy as chief<br />\nbugler. Of course, he is chief<br />\nbugler here. He is full of fun, always happy and quick to speak his<br />\nown mind. He must be up and<br />\nget his buglers up for first call at<br />\n6.20 A. M. One morning he overslept, and the officer of the day<br />\nrushed into the room at 6.10 to<br />\nwake him up. \"Hap\" thought it<br />\nwas one of the privates on guard<br />\nand, still half asleep, ejaculated:<br />\n\"Why in the \u2014 don't you wake<br />\na man up at 5.30.\" The officer<br />\nlaughed, and as \"Hap\" stirred<br />\nhimself, exclaimed: \"My, but you<br />\nare a sociable fellow to wake up.\"<br />\nThe joke was on \"Hap.\"<br />\nThis will do for today. Have<br />\nbeen detailed to the regimental<br />\ncoal pile in charge of men shoveling coal for the winter supply. A<br />\ngood many of the men are foreigners and I have trouble to get them<br />\nto understand. They keep telling<br />\nme they came to fight, not to shovel<br />\ncoal. Some dirty job!<br />\nYours,<br />\nJACK.<br />\nThe following letter is from<br />\nStanley Clark, sergeant in the<br />\nHopkins ambulance unit at Allentown, who was elected manager<br />\nof the lacrosse team for this year.<br />\nRoszel P. Thomsen, his successor<br />\nin that position, is the one to<br />\nwhom he writes. Clark pictures<br />\nmost vividly the experiences of<br />\nhiking.

The keynote of the University's policy in the war\u2014then<br />\nimminent\u2014was sounded on March<br />\n9, 1917, by the Board of Trustees<br />\nwhen it passed the following resolution, which, incidentally, was<br />\nsent to President Wilson, who<br />\ngratefully acknowledged it:<br />\n\"Resolved, that the trustees of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\npledge the loyal support of the<br />\nUniversity to the Government of<br />\nthe United States in its plans for<br />\nnational defense.\"<br />\nAt the same meeting, the trustees elected the following men to<br />\nserve on a University Committee<br />\non Research, which was to cooperate with the National Council<br />\nof Research: President Goodnow,<br />\nR.

The Engineering School<br />\nwas offered to the Aviation Corps<br />\nto serve as a \"ground school\" for<br />\nThe old Biological<br />\naviators.<br />\nBuilding, at the corner of Madison and Druid Hill avenues, was<br />\nturned over to the Red Cross as<br />\na headquarters building for that<br />\norganization. Leave of absence<br />\nwas granted to the members of the<br />\nfaculties of all the schools of the<br />\nUniversity who would engage in<br />\nwar work, and the president of the<br />\nUniversity was authorized on<br />\nApril 3, 1917, to grant for the remainder of the academic year,<br />\nupon recommendation of the faculty, degrees to all students of the<br />\nUniversity who entered into the<br />\nservice of the Government.<br />\nThe latest act of the trustees, in<br />\nthe way of Government service,<br />\nwas to provide for disabled American soldiers in the following resolution, introduced on October 2,<br />\n1917:<br />\n\"Resolved, that the president of<br />\nthe. University be authorized to<br />\nnotify the surgeon-general of the<br />\nWar Department that the University will open its courses free<br />\nof tuition to a reasonable number<br />\nof the soldiers of the United States<br />\nwho may be physically handicapped as a result of the war and<br />\nwho may be able to take such<br />\ncourses with profit.\"<br />\nIn addition to the service which<br />\nthe Board of Trustees has officially rendered the Government, indi-<br />\n<br />\nCompany B opened the intercompany football keries last Friday afternoon by defeating Company A on Straus Field by the<br />\nscore of 13 to 0.

DeMarco, the versatile quarterback of Company B, is their<br />\ncaptain and Lampe the manager,<br />\nwhile Littman and Thomsen fill<br />\nthe respective positions for Company A.<br />\nConsidering the small amount<br />\nof preparation, the gridiron maneuvers were well conducted; there<br />\nwere few fumbles, and, as Mr.<br />\nKistler said, both teams seemed to<br />\nknow which goal to run toward.<br />\nCompany B did most of the running. Its heavy artillery maintained a superiority of fire over<br />\nthe less experienced fighters of<br />\nCompany A, who battled bravely<br />\nbut in vain.<br />\nTaylor, who put up a star<br />\ngame at halfback for the winner,<br />\ncarried the ball over the line during the last minute of the first<br />\nhalf for a touchdown, but failed<br />\nto kick goal. Again in the third<br />\nperiod Company B worked the<br />\nball down to the 12-yard line and<br />\nthough Company A held hard they<br />\nmade their first down by inches<br />\nand Bitter carried the ball across.<br />\nTaylor kicked goal.

The lineup and<br />\nsummary:<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins boys in the Army<br />\nAmbulance Corps at Allentown<br />\nare now receiving the strictest<br />\nand most rigorous training yet experienced. The unit, along with<br />\n2,000 other men, is camped near<br />\nan old quarry about ten miles from<br />\ntown and is living under conditions simulating closely those of<br />\nthe battle lines in France. The<br />\nfirst week in this new encampment<br />\nwas spent sleeping under the litIle pup tents, but it was soon seen<br />\nthat these afforded ill protection<br />\nagainst the chill winds and rains<br />\nwhich sweep over the hill on which<br />\nthe camp is located. And as there<br />\nhas already been a flurry of snow<br />\nindicating that winter is near at<br />\nhand, the order was issued that<br />\nthe men should build dug-outs in<br />\nthe hillside in preparation for<br />\nwhat will probably be a month's<br />\nstay. The future ambulance drivers turned to the task with a will,<br />\nand under the supervision of several officers who have just returned from France, they soon had<br />\nconstructed a series of underground quarters which would be<br />\na credit to the most thoroughgoing Germans.<br />\nThe Hopkins unit was fortunate<br />\nin drawing a most desirable spot<br />\non the south side of the hill. When<br />\nthe order came to dig in, they were<br />\namong the first to finish and the<br />\nthoroughness and elaborateness<br />\nof their work drew for them the<br />\npraise of the officers in charge and<br />\ncaused their dug-outs to be made<br />\nthe models for the other units to<br />\ncopy. The men have not only put<br />\ndown wooden floors, but have<br />\nbuilt well-arranged fireplaces and<br />\nare even talking of having electricity brought to them, so that<br />\nthey can install electric lights.<br />\nThat this strenuous life is agreeing with the men is shown by the<br />\nfact that there is not a man in the<br />\ncamp hospital at the present time.<br />\nAnd this in spite of the fact that<br />\nthere is little water to drink and<br />\nnone to wash in. No one had had<br />\nthe opportunity of shaving for<br />\nnearly a week, so that when they<br />\nwere given permission to go to<br />\ntown Saturday they were hardly<br />\nrecognizable to their friends. Fortunately the new Y. M. C. A. had<br />\njust been opened and a shave and<br />\nmost enjoyable swim soon made<br />\nthe men feel more like themselves.<br />\nIn spite of the fact that they<br />\nare kept very busy, the Hopkins<br />\nmen are following the doings of<br />\ntheir Alma Mater's football team<br />\nand are hoping to get off to see<br />\nthe Haverford game. They are<br />\nalso giving a hearty support to<br />\nthe camp team, which is now going in great style and is acclaimed<br />\nby many as one of the best in<br />\nthe East.

Carey hit a stonewell, and Jones made a yard. Then<br />\nWinslow ripped off eleven yards<br />\naround theend ; lie made four more<br />\non the next play. Carey ploughed<br />\nthrough tackle for seven yards,<br />\nheld<br />\nand Western Maryland<br />\nCarey, Jones and Winslow for no<br />\ngains. Winslow dropped back for<br />\na place kick, Jones placing the<br />\nball. The skillful pilot met the<br />\nball squarely and sent it forty<br />\nyards through the air and squarely between the posts for the first<br />\nscore of the game.<br />\nSoon after Winslow had kicked<br />\noff, he gained 25 yards on three<br />\nsuccessive end runs. Then the<br />\nHopkins line failed to open up<br />\nholes for their backs and Winslow<br />\nresorted to a forward pass for<br />\n<br />\nwhich Carey made a pretty try and<br />\nwhich he barely missed. Western<br />\nMaryland started to march down<br />\nthe field, and was only stopped<br />\non the twenty-yard line, where<br />\nKeller made an unsuccessful attempt to drop-kick goal. Just as<br />\nthe period ended, Winslow, with<br />\nthe aid of beautiful interference,<br />\nskirted the end for twenty-five<br />\nyards, placing the ball in midfield.<br />\nJones opened up with twenty<br />\nyards on a fake kick. A forwarl<br />\npass from Winslow to Cashell,<br />\nwho made a sensational catch,<br />\nnetted fifteen yards. Winslow tore<br />\noff eleven more around end. Carey<br />\nhit the line for five yards, and<br />\nWinslow added three more. Jones<br />\ncame through and planted the ball<br />\non the five-yard mark. Carey went<br />\nthrough guard for three, and Jones<br />\nhit right tackle for one. Carey<br />\ncarried the ball over for a touchdown. Schmidt missed a difficult<br />\ngoal. During the remainder of the<br />\nperiod, Winslow's place-kick was<br />\nblocked,and Keller missed another<br />\ntry at field goal. Keller and Langrail completed two thirty-yard passes, and Keller tore off three<br />\npretty end runs averaging fifteen<br />\nyards.<br />\nThe second half found both<br />\nteams fighting desperately via the<br />\nair route. Hopkins completed two<br />\nforward passes, one of which was<br />\nfor thirty yards, but was called<br />\nback for a technical violation.<br />\nWestern Maryland completed one<br />\nthirty-five yard pass out of eleven<br />\ndesperate attempts to gain by the<br />\noverhead route. Keller had two<br />\nmore chances for drop-kicking<br />\ngoal, but could not make good.<br />\nWestern Maryland was forcing the<br />\nplay during the last half of the<br />\ngame, and kept the ball well within Hopkins' territory.

It is<br />\ncontrolled by the American International Corporation, and is connected With Stone & Webster,<br />\ngeneral engineers, of Boston, and<br />\nthe National City Bank of New<br />\nYork. The corporation has a shipbuilding yard at Philadelphia, and<br />\nhas under construction an office<br />\nbuilding at 140 North Broad<br />\nStreet.<br />\nMaterial for the ships is being<br />\nordered by contract now. The<br />\ncontract of the corporation with<br />\nthe government calls for the completion of the first lot of ships by<br />\nApril, 1918. The immediate purpose of these vessels is to serve as<br />\ntransports and supply ships to our<br />\nsoldiers and allies. The corporation has at its disposal all the<br />\nmoney and equipment that it can<br />\nuse in this project.<br />\nBeing a Marine Engineer, Professor Thomas felt that the call<br />\nwas especially urgent in view of<br />\nthe scarcity at the present time<br />\nof men trained in that line. The<br />\ncall of the corporation for him<br />\nwas put to the University in such<br />\na way that they considered it a<br />\nduty to let him go.

M. C.<br />\nA., Makes Stiring Appeal lo<br />\nHopkins Men.<br /><br />\nHopkins climbed the first rung<br />\nof the ladder for the State championship when she triumphed in a<br />\nhard-fought contest over the srcappy and fast Western Maryland<br />\nteam on Saturday by the score of<br />\n9 to 0. The lion's share of the<br />\ncredit for the victory goes to 011ie<br />\nWhislow, who took the starch out<br />\nof the Upstaters with a beautiful<br />\n40-yard goal from placement in<br />\nthe first few minutes of play, who<br />\nskirted the ends time and again<br />\nfor Hopkins' most substantial<br />\ngains, and who piloted the team<br />\nthrough a trying contest with<br />\nmasterly skill and judgment. The<br />\nHopkins team packed a real, driving punch and, for ilie first time<br />\nthis year, came through with flying colors. It was a great victory<br />\nand the stage was all set for it.<br />\nThe Hopkins battalion, in olive<br />\ndrab, in full force, aird preceded<br />\nby a fancy brass band, paraded to<br />\nHomewood field where they manoeuvered as a preliminary attraction to the big show. The student<br />\nbody of Western Maryland was<br />\nnot to be outdone and was there<br />\nwith its band. The largest crowd<br />\nof the year, numbering about four<br />\nthousand, filled the stands and<br />\nlined the field.<br />\nThe Hopkins Machine worked<br />\nsmoothly and steadily under the<br />\nguiding hand of their clever quarter, and at times exhibited flashes<br />\nthat recalled the old steam-roller<br />\ndays of 1915. Winslow drove the<br />\nteam at top speed and had them<br />\nfighting harder than ever before<br />\nand personally contributed liberally to the success of the team.<br />\nWoodward, Carey and Jones also<br />\ncame in for their share of the<br />\nhonors. The Hopkins captain outpunted his rival by many yards,<br />\nbooting the ball for flights that<br />\naveraged 50 yards. Carey, who<br />\nmade Hopkins' only score last<br />\nweek, is rapidly developing into a<br />\nstar half-back ; with a burst of<br />\nspeed and force, he consistently<br />\nbored his way through the Green<br />\nand Gold line, and finally carried<br />\nthe ball over the line for the lone<br />\ntouchdown. Jones, on account of<br />\na bad leg, was not given too much<br />\nwork, but whenever he was given<br />\nthe ball, the \"Speed-the-plough\"<br />\ndemon delivered the goods. The<br />\nline, although it had the advantage in weight, did not play up to<br />\nusual form, and for that reason<br />\nthe Western Maryland team was<br />\nalways ,dangerous.<br />\nHopkins jumped into the game<br />\nwith a dash that swept the Methodists off their feet, scoring in<br /><br />\nThat a\" constitution correlating<br />\nall the activities of the University<br />\nbe immediately drawn up was the<br />\ndecision of the Student Council at<br />\nits regular monthly meeting last<br />\nMonday night. A committee was<br />\nappointed to communicate with<br />\nthe governing student organizations of other Universities in regard to their methods of relating<br />\nthe branches of student interests,<br />\nas well as to make a thorough<br />\nstudy of our own activities and<br />\nlie proper manner of co-ordinating<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe student council then turned<br />\nits attention to the all-important<br />\nquestion of hazing. After much<br />\ndiscussion it was decided to delegate to the \"Pep committee\" of the<br />\nSophomore Class the power both<br />\nto conduct a roll-call of the freshmen at each football game, and to<br />\npass upon the excuses for absence.<br />\nAll excuses which this committee<br />\nconsiders unsatisfactory are then<br />\nreported to the Student Council<br />\nfor recommendation as to the best<br />\nmethod for dealing with the offender. Completing this important phase of the question, the<br />\nCouncil took up the subject of<br />\nhazing in general. This body felt<br />\nupon the conclusion of the discussion that the attitude of the<br />\nlower classes did not appear to be<br />\nexactly the proper one,as all forms<br />\nof pure hazing have long since<br />\nbeen abolished at Hopkins, and<br />\nthere remains only the rudimentary forms serving as penalties for<br />\ndisobedience to the regulations.<br />\nIn order to correct this improper<br />\nconception, it was decided to send<br />\nrepresentatives to the next meeting of the lower classes.<br />\nA particularly flagrant case of<br />\nutter disregard of all regulations<br />\nhaving been summoned before the<br />\nCouncil was then giving a hearing. Yaffe, '21, speaking in his<br />\nown defense, noted as extenuating<br />\ncircumstance the fact that he had<br />\nattended another institution for<br />\ntwo weeks and while there he had<br />\ncomplied with the regulations. It<br />\nwas admitted, however, upon crossexamination that he knew of the<br />\nrequirement in the University requiring all students to obey the<br />\nfreshmen regulations until they<br />\nshall have completed one semester<br />\nin either this cir another University. The Council finally decided<br />\nthe defendant guilty of breaking<br />\nthe regulations, and as a penalty<br />\nwill compel him to obey them during both semesters.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS<br /><br />\nHITS<br /><br />\nHER<br /><br />\nSTRIDE<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nThe Western Maryland Game<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 7,(ol. 1)<br /><br />\nApproximately s800 has been<br />\nraised as a result of a campaign<br />\nfor the Students' Friendship War<br />\nFund held on Thursday and Friday of last week at the University under the auspices of the Y.<br />\nM.

A million dollars is being raised for this fund throughout all the colleges of the country,<br />\nand up to the time of this article<br />\ngoing to press, the above amount<br />\nhas been subscribed at Hopkins,<br />\nwith 300 of the student body yet<br />\nunheard from. A central committee was gotten together earlier in<br />\nthe week, and the need was presented to them, with the result<br />\nthat the twenty-seven men in that<br />\nsmall group pledged themselves<br />\nfor over $540.<br />\nThis central<br />\ngroup was organized into committees, a certain number of men<br />\nto each class, and the campaign<br />\nproper was started at a massmeeting on Thursday noon, with a<br />\ntalk by Mr. David Porter, secretary of the central board of the<br />\nV. M. C. A.<br />\nMr. Porter said in opening that<br />\nhe thought this was the most momentous proposal ever brought before the University. \"We hear so<br />\nmuch of the five millions of men<br />\nwho are lying wounded in the hospitals of Europe, and we know<br />\nwhat those men have sacrificed<br />\nand are sacrificing for the common<br />\ncause of us all. We too must<br />\nlearn what sacrificing means,<br />\nwhen these men,some of them now<br />\nour friends, cousins and brothers,<br />\nare sacrificing so much.\"<br />\nThere are more than six million<br />\nmen in the prison camps of Europe today, and Mr. Porter then<br />\ntold of the conditions under which<br />\nmost of those men are living; their<br />\nquarters being low huts without<br />\nany artificial heat, enclosed on all<br />\nsides by barbed wire and machine<br />\nguns, with the men's cots built up<br />\nin tiers three deep. Many of these<br />\nmen are college students and high<br />\nschool graduates accustomed to<br />\nluxury.<br />\nThe speaker stated that one of<br />\nthe worst features of the life in<br />\nthese prison camps is its awful<br />\ntedium, which has rendered thousands of inmates insane and has<br />\nbrought thousands more to a state<br />\nclosely bordering on insanity. Mr.<br />\nPorter recounted several incidents<br />\nin lint. He stated that it was<br />\njust this state of affairs which the<br />\nStudents' Friendship War Fund<br />\nhas.been 'organized to combat. Its<br />\npromoters hope to introduce into<br />\nthe prison camps features of an<br />\neducational and fraternal nature,<br />\n(Continued \u00b0it' page 8, col. 3)<br /><br />\nBy COACH BRENN1CK<br /><br />\nThe team from Western Maryland College came to Homewood<br />\nSaturday well trained, fast and<br />\nover-brimming with confidence because of an hitherto clean slate,<br />\nas they had defeated all their previous opponents, including St.<br />\nJohn's College. Our team rose to<br />\nthe occasion, however, and by<br />\nskillful playing in the first half<br />\nsecured a lead sufficient to permit them to come out victorious.<br />\nMuch had been said of the tricky<br />\nnature of the Western Maryland<br />\nattack, but it was very manifest<br />\nthat it was not by tricks that they<br />\nmade their notable advances, but<br />\nrather by a well-planned and wellexecuted series of line plunges. In<br />\nfootball, as in life, tricks do not<br />\navail one much if the good, hard<br />\nwork on fundamentals and the exercise of the intelligence are neglected.<br />\nThe team is entitled to a great<br />\ndeal of credit for the manner in<br />\nwhich they played Saturday, because for many of them it was the<br />\nfirst championship game in which<br />\nthey had participated and each<br />\nman felt just how much was at<br />\n- stake.

So well did each man do \u2022<br />\nhis allotted portion that it would<br />\nseem unjust to single out individuals for commendation, yet one<br />\ncannot help but praise Captain<br />\nWoodward for the way in which<br />\nhe set the pace for his men and<br />\nWinslow for his subperb generalship.<br />\nThe winning of this game by no<br />\nmeans spells perfection for the<br />\nteam, and I am sure that no one<br />\nis. more aware of this than each<br />\nmember of the squad. It is doubtful, and this is said without the<br />\nleast intention of detracting from<br />\nthe credit earned by the team Saturday, if the same sort of game<br />\nwould be enough to defeat St.<br />\nJohn's, as St. John's stands today.<br />\nIt is of course a fact that Western Maryland defeated St. John's,<br />\nbut all of us know only too well<br />\nthat facts and logic often go<br />\nawry when applied to a St. John'sHopkins game.

He also very earnestly asked that the men give<br />\ntheir full support to the battalion<br />\ndance.<br />\nThe meeting was then turned<br />\nover to the battalion, and Captain<br />\nBitter urged that every man see<br />\nto it that he carries himself with<br />\na soldierly bearing, whether in<br />\nuniform or not.

C.)<br /><br />\nWhen the call to national service<br />\narose, spirited young men everywhere of course wanted to be employed in a patriotic way, and I<br />\nsuppose there is scarcely a young<br />\nman in any college in the country<br />\nwho has not very anxiously addressed to himself the question:<br />\n\"What can I do?\"<br />\nI think that there is no general<br />\nanswer to this question. Even in<br />\nthose cases where it would be obviously better for a young men to<br />\nstay at college and prepare himself for later and fuller usefulness;<br />\nyet if the young man in so doing<br />\nacquires a low view of his own<br />\ncourage, and feels that he was<br />\nelecting the less worthy course, the<br />\neffect on the young man of that<br />\nstate of mind toward his own actions probably would be so prejudicial that it ought not to be encouraged.<br />\nTo the extent that the men<br />\nin college are physically disqualified, or .to the extent that they<br />\nare too young to meet the requirements of the department, it seems<br />\nquite clear that in the present<br />\nstate of the emergency their major usefulness lies in remaining<br />\nin the college, going forward with<br />\ntheir academic work. The knowledge that the students will acquire at college will equip them<br />\nfor subsequent usefulness if the<br />\nemergency lasts until their call<br />\ncomes.<br />\nBut we do not want to chill enthusiasm. We want to preserve<br />\nenthusiasm and cultivate it and<br />\nuse it; but we do want to be discriminating in our enthusiasm,<br />\nand prevent people getting the notion that they are not helping the,<br />\ncountry unless threy do something<br />\ndifferent, which very often is not<br />\nthe case at all. The largest usefulness may come from doing the<br />\nsame thing. Now, it is not unnatural that there should be these<br />\nebullitions of feeling, this desire<br />\nto change occupation as a badge<br />\nof changed service and devotion<br />\nto ideals. Our colleges can exercise a steadying influence in this<br />\n\u2022<br />\nregard.<br />\nWe are going to have losses on<br />\nthe sea; we are going to have<br />\nlosses in battle; our communities<br />\nare going to be subjected to the<br />\nrigid discipline of multiplied personal griefs scattered all through<br />\nthe community, and we are going<br />\nto search the cause of those back<br />\nto titer foundation, and our feelings are going to be torn and our<br />\nnerves made raw. There is a place<br />\nfor physicians of public opinion<br />\nto exercise a curative impulse.<br />\nThe young men who are in our<br />\ncolleges, who go to their homes<br />\nfrom our colleges and make up a<br />\nvery large part of the direction of<br />\npublic opinion, can exercise a curative influence by preaching the<br /><br />\nHopkins Meets Haverford on Foreign<br />\nGrounds Saturday\u2014Has Lost Last<br />\nTwo Years\u2014Rooters to Accompany Team.<br /><br />\nG.

A delegation of rooters will probably accompany it, to help bring back<br />\na victory.<br />\nThe Haverford team, which will<br />\noppose the Hopkins eleven, is an<br />\nopponent of old, and holds the<br />\nedge on the Black and Blue team<br />\nin contests won for the last few<br />\nyears. Two years ago when every<br />\nHopkins man was convinced that<br />\nCharlie Brickley had developed a<br />\nworld-beater, a goodly number<br />\nfollowed the team to the Pennsylvania institution and saw their<br />\nfavorites robbed of the game by<br />\nincompetent officials.<br />\nLast year,when the elevens were<br />\nalmost evenly matched, the Red<br />\nand White insisted on using an<br />\nillegal pass which Coach Brennick<br />\ninsisted was illegal. However, the<br />\nmen that ran the game could not<br />\nsee things that way, and the Black<br />\nand Blue went to the showers<br />\nfirmly convinced that they were<br />\nrooked again. This year both<br />\nsquads will enter the game with<br />\neven chances, and if the men that<br />\nthe central board select do not<br />\nbungle, the proverbial fur should<br />\nfly.<br />\n- ace the<br />\nThe team that will f<br />\nBlack and Blue will be very similar to the visitors from the point<br />\nof view of material. Not until the<br />\ncollege opened did the Haverford<br />\nfollowers have the least idea what<br />\nwould be the status of their team.<br />\nToday it is composed for the most<br />\npart of freshmen, only one'Varsity<br />\nman having returned to the college.

The resolution to this effect reads: \"Owing<br />\nto the abnormal conditions existing at the University at the present time, it is the feeling of the<br />\nboard that it is impossible to recognize any minor sports this<br />\nyear.\"<br />\nThis conclusion was drawn after a long discussion on the feasibility of the Association backing<br />\nthese two popular winter sports.<br />\nPerhaps the most valid reasons<br />\noffered against recognition were<br />\nthat Hopkins has neither a gymnasium nor a pool of its own available, and hence it would not feel<br />\njustified in inviting other college<br />\nteams to compete with it. It is the<br />\nearnest deside of the board, however, that the energy which would<br />\notherwise be spent in organizing<br />\nand developing a team will be diverted to the various inter-company contests. Even though it is<br />\npossible that the swimming and<br />\nbasket-ball teams will organize independently, they will not be permitted to use the name of Johns<br />\nHopkins this year.<br />\nAlex Wolfe was elected captain<br />\nof the lacrosse team pro tempore<br />\nuntil one should be elected at a<br />\nmeeting of the squad to be called<br />\nin the near future. by Manager<br />\nThomsen.<br /><br />\ndoctrine of tolerance, by exemplifying the fact that it is not necessary for a nation like the United<br />\nStates, which is fighting for the<br />\nvindication of a great ideal, to<br />\ndiscolor its purpose by hatreds or<br />\nby the entertainment of any unworthy emotion.<br /><br />\nCOURSE IN SIGNAL ENGINEERING<br />\nMajor Guild and Dr. Kouwenhoven to<br />\nGive Instruction to Engineering<br />\nSeniors in Battalion for Commissions in Signal Corps.<br /><br />\nDr. Kouwenhoven, head of the<br />\ndepartment of electrical engineering, in co-operation with Major<br />\nGuild, is preparing to offer a<br />\ncourse in signal engineering which<br />\nwill be open to seniors in engineering who are members of the<br />\nUniversity battalion.

Stuart, '20.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOV. 12, 1917.<br />\nThe Student Council.<br /><br />\nThe Student Council has at last<br />\nshaken off its lethargy and is literally jumping into its proper<br />\nplace as the dominant and controlling body in college life. After its whirlwind round up of disobedient freshmen and others disregardful of Hopkins traditions<br />\nlast week, no student will doubt<br />\nthat he is beyond the reach of its<br />\nlong arm, but will realize that upholding the University traditions<br />\nand regulations is not only his<br />\nduty but the best policy for him<br />\nto pursue. There shall be no<br />\nquibbling hereafter on the part of<br />\nfreshmen as to whether they wear<br />\ncaps and buttons or not; that is<br />\ndefinitely understood.<br />\nBut let no one think that the<br />\nStudent Council is merely a police<br />\ncourt for offenders of the law. It<br />\nis infinitely more than that. It<br />\nis composed of men who are elected by the students and who are<br />\nworking for the best interests of<br />\nthe students. It is the recognized<br />\nmedium between the undergraduates and the faculty. The biggest<br />\nand most important of its present<br />\nchosen tasks is to frame a constitution which will establish on a<br />\nfirm basis for all time the status<br />\nof each student activity, and crystallize in the finest form many of<br />\nthe yet unwritten traditions. The<br />\ntime is at an end for one to smile<br />\nwhen the name of the Student<br />\nCouncil is mentioned. That body<br />\nis going to make itself felt in<br />\nevery line of student endeavor. It<br />\nwill be a high court of justice, a<br />\nrespected legislature and administrative body, and the champion of<br />\nHopkins traditions. It is the duty<br />\nof each one of us to become its<br />\nardent supporter.<br /><br />\nThe Time Is Not Ripe.<br /><br />\nThe decision of the Athletic<br />\nBoard not to recognize basket-ball<br />\nand swimming is undoubtedly a<br />\nhard blow to the two small groups<br />\nof enthusiasts who so earnestly<br />\npresented petitions for the official<br />\nacknowledgement of these minor<br />\nsports as forms of Hopkins athletics.<br />\nThis decision was not a hasty<br />\none by any means, but was made<br />\nafter a long discussion as to<br />\nwhether basket-ball and swimming<br />\nteams could this year take the<br />\nplace which should be accorded<br />\nthem in college activities. There<br />\nare many valid objections, and<br />\neven those who may be most disappointed by the outcome of the<br />\nboard meeting, can see the justice<br />\nof the decision.<br />\nThe obstacles may be summed<br />\nup in two sentences. In the first<br />\nplace the introduction of these<br />\nteams would be confronted by the<br />\nunsettled and abnormal conditions<br />\nwhich are manifestly handicapping the other forms of Hopkins<br />\nathletics. Furthermore, the utter<br />\nlack of facilities for staging contests would make it impossible to<br />\ncarry on these activities in a manner befitting major sports.<br />\nThe board, however, does not<br />\nwant these sports to die out as<br />\nthere is still a chance for recognition in the future. The enthusiasts can work toward their desired goal by helping to build up<br />\ninter - company and inter - class<br />\nbasket-ball and swimming, thus<br />\ngradually developing a gold mine<br />\nof material for the teams when the<br />\nproper time comes for recognition.<br />\nThe Friendship Fund.<br /><br />\nIn his appeal for the Students'<br />\nFriendship War Fund last week,<br />\nMr. Porter of the Y. M. C. A.<br />\nstruck a chord which should find<br />\nready response from every one of<br />\nus. It was that of opportunity for<br />\nsacrifice. We are here, most of us,<br />\nbecause we feel that we can serve<br />\nLest by being here, but that cannot<br />\nlessen the longing to be doing<br />\nsomething for the cause which lies<br />\nalways just below the surface of<br />\nour consciousness. Here is the<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nVictory!<br /><br />\nLast Saturday was a red-letter<br />\nday for Johns Hopkins. Not so<br />\nmuch because our team fought<br />\nstanchly and well\u2014we have come<br />\nto take that as a matter of course<br />\nthis fall\u2014but because of the spontaneous outburst of genuine college spirit shown by the student<br />\nbody.<br />\nThe outcome of last Saturday's<br />\ngame was gratifying. But had the<br />\nscore been twenty to nothing for<br />\nWestern Maryland, a notable Hopkins victory would still have been<br />\nscored. Hopkins spirit has won.<br />\nIt is here to stay.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nLiters from Alen in Service. 11<br /><br />\nA close view of the life at Camp<br />\nMeade is given in the following letter from \"Jack\" Mowbray,'17, sergeant in the 315th Infantry. Besides telling interesting incidents,<br />\nhe speaks of several Hopkins men.<br />\n\"Hank\" Chalmers, one of them,<br />\nwas a member of the present Senior Class, manager of baseball, a<br />\nlacrosse star and assistant general<br />\nsecretary of the Hopkins Y. M. C.<br />\nA. He is now assistant to Mr.<br />\nLindley, formerly in charge of the<br />\nY. M. C. A. work at Hopkins, and<br />\nis hoping to be sent across the<br />\nAtlantic soon for service in<br />\nFrance:<br />\nCAMP MEADE,<br />\nOctober 30, 1917.<br />\nDEAR CARROLL:<br />\nOne thing I forgot to speak of<br />\nin my last letter is the three Hopkins men who are doing their bit<br />\nhere. Do you remember Sergeant<br />\nFreelander? Well, he is captain<br />\nof Company I in our regiment,<br />\nthe 315th. He has been very nice<br />\nto us since our arrival and we recall happy days at Hopkins when<br />\npeace reigned supreme in our fair<br />\nland. (That was a nice, worn-out<br />\nphrase.) The other two are<br />\n\"Hank\" Chalmers,'18, and Mr. A.<br />\nE. Lindley, last year's collegiate<br />\nsecretary. They are both together<br />\nhere in charge of our branch Y.<br />\nM.C.A. \"Hank\" is doing very well<br />\nhere and is very popular. He is<br />\nshowing fine spirit when he knows<br />\nhe will be rejected on account of<br />\nhis eyes in the draft. He anxiously awaits orders to go across the<br />\npond and is working hard to go<br />\nover as soon as he can. It is very<br />\namusing to see him \"impersonate\"<br />\nan officer (if that is a good military term). He wears the Y. M.<br />\nC. A. uniform, which is a gray<br />\ncolor, but he covers it with a short<br />\nsheepskin-lined coat such as all<br />\nofficers here wear. Almost every<br />\nrookie salutes and \"Hank\" is as<br />\ngracious as a major-general in his<br />\nreturn.<br />\nWarner and I are now on special<br />\nduty. We are sergeants in charge<br />\nof the work done by the prisoners<br />\nin camp and their number is<br />\nlegion. You should see us directing the handling of large boxes of<br />\nrubbish, trash, etc., seated on the<br />\nwagon seat of a big army wagon.<br />\nOur pride at being sergeants far<br />\nexceeds any feelings of anticipation we might have had at Fort<br />\nMyer. A sergeant seems to be a<br />\ngreat man among real men. A<br />\nlieutenant\u2014well, why pick on such<br />\na small potato? One of the characters here is Sergeant Wheating.<br />\nHe is filling out his eleventh enlistment, i. e., his thirty-third<br />\nyear. He possesses fifty-two good<br />\nteeth and a clean record. He expects to be retired this year and<br />\npensioned on account of his long<br />\nservice.<br />\nAnother character is \"Bill\"<br />\nLupton, otherwise known as<br />\n\"Hap.\" Before he was drafted he<br /><br />\nhad served in the navy as chief<br />\nbugler. Of course, he is chief<br />\nbugler here. He is full of fun, always happy and quick to speak his<br />\nown mind. He must be up and<br />\nget his buglers up for first call at<br />\n6.20 A. M. One morning he overslept, and the officer of the day<br />\nrushed into the room at 6.10 to<br />\nwake him up. \"Hap\" thought it<br />\nwas one of the privates on guard<br />\nand, still half asleep, ejaculated:<br />\n\"Why in the \u2014 don't you wake<br />\na man up at 5.30.\" The officer<br />\nlaughed, and as \"Hap\" stirred<br />\nhimself, exclaimed: \"My, but you<br />\nare a sociable fellow to wake up.\"<br />\nThe joke was on \"Hap.\"<br />\nThis will do for today. Have<br />\nbeen detailed to the regimental<br />\ncoal pile in charge of men shoveling coal for the winter supply. A<br />\ngood many of the men are foreigners and I have trouble to get them<br />\nto understand. They keep telling<br />\nme they came to fight, not to shovel<br />\ncoal. Some dirty job!<br />\nYours,<br />\nJACK.<br />\nThe following letter is from<br />\nStanley Clark, sergeant in the<br />\nHopkins ambulance unit at Allentown, who was elected manager<br />\nof the lacrosse team for this year.<br />\nRoszel P.

The keynote of the University's policy in the war\u2014then<br />\nimminent\u2014was sounded on March<br />\n9, 1917, by the Board of Trustees<br />\nwhen it passed the following resolution, which, incidentally, was<br />\nsent to President Wilson, who<br />\ngratefully acknowledged it:<br />\n\"Resolved, that the trustees of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\npledge the loyal support of the<br />\nUniversity to the Government of<br />\nthe United States in its plans for<br />\nnational defense.\"<br />\nAt the same meeting, the trustees elected the following men to<br />\nserve on a University Committee<br />\non Research, which was to cooperate with the National Council<br />\nof Research: President Goodnow,<br />\nR. Brent Keyser, Joseph S. Ames,<br />\nWalter A. Baetjer, J. C. W. Frazer, Jacob H. Hollander, Walter<br />\nJones. William Bullock Clark,<br />\nBurton E:Livingston, H. F. Read,<br />\nIra Remsen, William H. Welch,<br />\nJohn B. Whitehead, Daniel Willard and F. W. Wood.<br />\nSubsequently, the grounds and<br />\nbuildings of the University were<br />\noffered to the Secretary of War for<br />\nuse as a reserve officers' training<br />\ncamp. The Engineering School<br />\nwas offered to the Aviation Corps<br />\nto serve as a \"ground school\" for<br />\nThe old Biological<br />\naviators.<br />\nBuilding, at the corner of Madison and Druid Hill avenues, was<br />\nturned over to the Red Cross as<br />\na headquarters building for that<br />\norganization. Leave of absence<br />\nwas granted to the members of the<br />\nfaculties of all the schools of the<br />\nUniversity who would engage in<br />\nwar work, and the president of the<br />\nUniversity was authorized on<br />\nApril 3, 1917, to grant for the remainder of the academic year,<br />\nupon recommendation of the faculty, degrees to all students of the<br />\nUniversity who entered into the<br />\nservice of the Government.<br />\nThe latest act of the trustees, in<br />\nthe way of Government service,<br />\nwas to provide for disabled American soldiers in the following resolution, introduced on October 2,<br />\n1917:<br />\n\"Resolved, that the president of<br />\nthe. University be authorized to<br />\nnotify the surgeon-general of the<br />\nWar Department that the University will open its courses free<br />\nof tuition to a reasonable number<br />\nof the soldiers of the United States<br />\nwho may be physically handicapped as a result of the war and<br />\nwho may be able to take such<br />\ncourses with profit.\"<br />\nIn addition to the service which<br />\nthe Board of Trustees has officially rendered the Government, indi-<br /><br />\nCompany B opened the intercompany football keries last Friday afternoon by defeating Company A on Straus Field by the<br />\nscore of 13 to 0. Major Guild<br />\nstarted the game as referee.<br />\nBoth teams had had but one<br />\npractice, on Wednesday afternoon,<br />\nwhen the teams were organized<br />\nand captains and managers elected. DeMarco, the versatile quarterback of Company B, is their<br />\ncaptain and Lampe the manager,<br />\nwhile Littman and Thomsen fill<br />\nthe respective positions for Company A.<br />\nConsidering the small amount<br />\nof preparation, the gridiron maneuvers were well conducted; there<br />\nwere few fumbles, and, as Mr.<br />\nKistler said, both teams seemed to<br />\nknow which goal to run toward.<br />\nCompany B did most of the running. Its heavy artillery maintained a superiority of fire over<br />\nthe less experienced fighters of<br />\nCompany A, who battled bravely<br />\nbut in vain.<br />\nTaylor, who put up a star<br />\ngame at halfback for the winner,<br />\ncarried the ball over the line during the last minute of the first<br />\nhalf for a touchdown, but failed<br />\nto kick goal. Again in the third<br />\nperiod Company B worked the<br />\nball down to the 12-yard line and<br />\nthough Company A held hard they<br />\nmade their first down by inches<br />\nand Bitter carried the ball across.<br />\nTaylor kicked goal. Taylor and<br />\nDeMarco were the stars for the<br />\nvictors, while Bratt and Sickel did<br />\nthe best work for Company A.<br />\nMajor Guild refereed part of the<br />\ngame and the other battalion officers officiated. The lineup and<br />\nsummary:<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins boys in the Army<br />\nAmbulance Corps at Allentown<br />\nare now receiving the strictest<br />\nand most rigorous training yet experienced. The unit, along with<br />\n2,000 other men, is camped near<br />\nan old quarry about ten miles from<br />\ntown and is living under conditions simulating closely those of<br />\nthe battle lines in France. The<br />\nfirst week in this new encampment<br />\nwas spent sleeping under the litIle pup tents, but it was soon seen<br />\nthat these afforded ill protection<br />\nagainst the chill winds and rains<br />\nwhich sweep over the hill on which<br />\nthe camp is located. And as there<br />\nhas already been a flurry of snow<br />\nindicating that winter is near at<br />\nhand, the order was issued that<br />\nthe men should build dug-outs in<br />\nthe hillside in preparation for<br />\nwhat will probably be a month's<br />\nstay. The future ambulance drivers turned to the task with a will,<br />\nand under the supervision of several officers who have just returned from France, they soon had<br />\nconstructed a series of underground quarters which would be<br />\na credit to the most thoroughgoing Germans.<br />\nThe Hopkins unit was fortunate<br />\nin drawing a most desirable spot<br />\non the south side of the hill. When<br />\nthe order came to dig in, they were<br />\namong the first to finish and the<br />\nthoroughness and elaborateness<br />\nof their work drew for them the<br />\npraise of the officers in charge and<br />\ncaused their dug-outs to be made<br />\nthe models for the other units to<br />\ncopy. The men have not only put<br />\ndown wooden floors, but have<br />\nbuilt well-arranged fireplaces and<br />\nare even talking of having electricity brought to them, so that<br />\nthey can install electric lights.<br />\nThat this strenuous life is agreeing with the men is shown by the<br />\nfact that there is not a man in the<br />\ncamp hospital at the present time.<br />\nAnd this in spite of the fact that<br />\nthere is little water to drink and<br />\nnone to wash in. No one had had<br />\nthe opportunity of shaving for<br />\nnearly a week, so that when they<br />\nwere given permission to go to<br />\ntown Saturday they were hardly<br />\nrecognizable to their friends. Fortunately the new Y. M. C. A. had<br />\njust been opened and a shave and<br />\nmost enjoyable swim soon made<br />\nthe men feel more like themselves.<br />\nIn spite of the fact that they<br />\nare kept very busy, the Hopkins<br />\nmen are following the doings of<br />\ntheir Alma Mater's football team<br />\nand are hoping to get off to see<br />\nthe Haverford game.

Carey hit a stonewell, and Jones made a yard. Then<br />\nWinslow ripped off eleven yards<br />\naround theend ; lie made four more<br />\non the next play. Carey ploughed<br />\nthrough tackle for seven yards,<br />\nheld<br />\nand Western Maryland<br />\nCarey, Jones and Winslow for no<br />\ngains. Winslow dropped back for<br />\na place kick, Jones placing the<br />\nball. The skillful pilot met the<br />\nball squarely and sent it forty<br />\nyards through the air and squarely between the posts for the first<br />\nscore of the game.<br />\nSoon after Winslow had kicked<br />\noff, he gained 25 yards on three<br />\nsuccessive end runs. Then the<br />\nHopkins line failed to open up<br />\nholes for their backs and Winslow<br />\nresorted to a forward pass for<br /><br />\nwhich Carey made a pretty try and<br />\nwhich he barely missed. Western<br />\nMaryland started to march down<br />\nthe field, and was only stopped<br />\non the twenty-yard line, where<br />\nKeller made an unsuccessful attempt to drop-kick goal. Just as<br />\nthe period ended, Winslow, with<br />\nthe aid of beautiful interference,<br />\nskirted the end for twenty-five<br />\nyards, placing the ball in midfield.<br />\nJones opened up with twenty<br />\nyards on a fake kick. A forwarl<br />\npass from Winslow to Cashell,<br />\nwho made a sensational catch,<br />\nnetted fifteen yards. Winslow tore<br />\noff eleven more around end. Carey<br />\nhit the line for five yards, and<br />\nWinslow added three more. Jones<br />\ncame through and planted the ball<br />\non the five-yard mark. Carey went<br />\nthrough guard for three, and Jones<br />\nhit right tackle for one. Carey<br />\ncarried the ball over for a touchdown. Schmidt missed a difficult<br />\ngoal. During the remainder of the<br />\nperiod, Winslow's place-kick was<br />\nblocked,and Keller missed another<br />\ntry at field goal. Keller and Langrail completed two thirty-yard passes, and Keller tore off three<br />\npretty end runs averaging fifteen<br />\nyards.<br />\nThe second half found both<br />\nteams fighting desperately via the<br />\nair route. Hopkins completed two<br />\nforward passes, one of which was<br />\nfor thirty yards, but was called<br />\nback for a technical violation.<br />\nWestern Maryland completed one<br />\nthirty-five yard pass out of eleven<br />\ndesperate attempts to gain by the<br />\noverhead route. Keller had two<br />\nmore chances for drop-kicking<br />\ngoal, but could not make good.<br />\nWestern Maryland was forcing the<br />\nplay during the last half of the<br />\ngame, and kept the ball well within Hopkins' territory.

The corporation has a shipbuilding yard at Philadelphia, and<br />\nhas under construction an office<br />\nbuilding at 140 North Broad<br />\nStreet.<br />\nMaterial for the ships is being<br />\nordered by contract now. The<br />\ncontract of the corporation with<br />\nthe government calls for the completion of the first lot of ships by<br />\nApril, 1918.

The corporation has at its disposal all the<br />\nmoney and equipment that it can<br />\nuse in this project.<br />\nBeing a Marine Engineer, Professor Thomas felt that the call<br />\nwas especially urgent in view of<br />\nthe scarcity at the present time<br />\nof men trained in that line. The<br />\ncall of the corporation for him<br />\nwas put to the University in such<br />\na way that they considered it a<br />\nduty to let him go.
