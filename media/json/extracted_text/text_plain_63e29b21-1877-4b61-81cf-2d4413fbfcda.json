The Republican party today proposes to return<br />\nto its traditional isolation and aloofness.

But his foreign policy since<br />\nthen has been not only sane but conducive to peace. In his Chataqua adadre-ss, Mr. Roosevelt made many correct statements about the need of<br />\npeace. He has fortified American neutrality. He has refused to let the flag<br />\nfollow the dollar. He has antagonized<br />\nthe interests which draw profits from<br />\nwar\u2014 and has consequently strengthened the hope of peace for America.<br />\n* * * *<br />\nMr. Roosevelt's experiment in democratic government has been of the<br />\n<br />\nreal essence of democracy. Every factor in democracy has been diligently<br />\nprotected and applied. He has tried<br />\nto create an economy based upon the<br />\npeculiarities of the American situation<br />\na system which would promote happiness of the masses of the<br />\nAmerican people by the sage exploitation, rather than the waste, of the<br />\nnatural resources of the potentially<br />\nrichest nation in the world.<br />\nMr. Roosevelt calls it an \"economic<br />\nconstitutional order.\" What's in a<br />\nname? It is, essentially, a balanced<br />\ndemocratic social state in which social<br />\ncontrol is used intelligently to maintain the balance of society. He has<br />\nrealized the fact that free competition<br />\nand individual initiative, when given<br />\nfull reign, prove their own executors.<br />\nThe period of hasty experimentation<br />\nis over. There is little doubt that Mr.<br />\nRoosevelt has pulled America out of<br />\na dangerous rut \u2014 both psychologically and actually. His case is strong<br />\nstatistically. The job for the next four<br />\nyears is on of consolidation of<br />\nground gained in the sense of scratching deeper the surface of social security and in securing the benefits of recent experimentation.<br />\nWe believe the record asks that Mr.<br />\nRoosevelt be re-elected. But more important, more fundamental than this<br />\nis the fact that Mr. Roosevelt has<br />\nacccmplished everything within a democratic form of government. He has<br />\nproven that democracy is capable of<br />\nfacing a crisis. He has renewed confidence in libertanian government.<br />\n<br />\nLettertothe Editor<br />\nBrick-bats, brick-bats, brick-bats!

The very fact<br />\nthat it appeared on the front page<br />\nstinks of Hearst methods. Only the<br />\ndecorum of your newspaper prevents<br />\nme from using stronger language.<br />\nIn the first two paragraphs you appeal to the Muse of public virtue according to accepted Hearst technique.<br />\nIn the third you attack Landon personally and introduce the false issue<br />\nof Fascism, exactly as Hearst introduced Communism. In the fifth paragraph, the sixth, the seventh, the<br />\neighth ,the ninth, the tenth, the eleventh, the twelfth, the thirteenth, the<br />\nfourteenth, the fifteenth, the sixteenth, the seventeenth, the eighteenth, and the nineteenth paragraphs<br />\nyou repeat and reiterate the same<br />\nfalse and ridiculous charge over and<br />\nover. Why did you bother to rewrite<br />\nit each time; you could have achieved<br />\nthe same effect by merely repeating<br />\nit verbatim again and again. If this<br />\nis not Hearstism, what is?<br />\nYou also demonstrate a striking<br />\nignorance of facts.
