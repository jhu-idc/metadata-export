It was about the election of<br />\nthe delegate to the Board of Governors of the Athletic Association at<br />\ntheir class meeting. The freshmen<br />\nhave been misunderstood about this<br />\nmatter. The sophomores, their old<br />\nrivals quickly accused them of deplorable ignorance, but the sophomores showed their own lack of sense<br />\nwhen doing so.<br />\nThe freshman class has adopted for<br />\nitself a doctrine similar to the Monroe Doctrine of the United States. It<br />\nis their \"Hands Off Policy.' At the<br />\nfirst of last month the \"freshies\"made<br />\nclear their attitude to their would be<br />\nhazers and when they elected their<br />\ndelegate they were merely continuing their \"Hands Off Policy.\" For if<br />\nthe freshman delegate was elected by<br />\nthe whole student body, the members<br />\nof the other classes would have more<br />\nto do with the selection than the<br />\nfreshmen themselves. But by their<br />\ningenious method of electing their<br />\ndelegate, the freshmen would have<br />\nforced the upperclassmen to ratify<br />\ntheir candidate as no matter whom<br />\nthe members of the other classes<br />\nwould have nominated for freshman delegate, all the nominees would<br />\nhave resigned except the one elected<br />\nat the freshman class meeting. The<br />\nfreshmen therefore think that instead<br />\nof being accused .of deplorable ignorance, they should be given credit for<br />\nhaving shown the most foresight of<br />\nany class that has ever entered this<br />\ninstitution, as they were the first to<br />\nfind a way of sending a delegate<br />\nelected by themselves to the Board of<br />\nGovernors of the Athletic Association.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI. \u2014 American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

Bible Classes<br />\nwill meet as usual this week.<br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nIn the first number of this publication there was a little squib attached<br />\nto the account of the freshman election which in a sarcastic manner<br />\nseemed to reflect on the freshman<br />\nclass. It was about the election of<br />\nthe delegate to the Board of Governors of the Athletic Association at<br />\ntheir class meeting. The freshmen<br />\nhave been misunderstood about this<br />\nmatter. The sophomores, their old<br />\nrivals quickly accused them of deplorable ignorance, but the sophomores showed their own lack of sense<br />\nwhen doing so.<br />\nThe freshman class has adopted for<br />\nitself a doctrine similar to the Monroe Doctrine of the United States. It<br />\nis their \"Hands Off Policy.' At the<br />\nfirst of last month the \"freshies\"made<br />\nclear their attitude to their would be<br />\nhazers and when they elected their<br />\ndelegate they were merely continuing their \"Hands Off Policy.\" For if<br />\nthe freshman delegate was elected by<br />\nthe whole student body, the members<br />\nof the other classes would have more<br />\nto do with the selection than the<br />\nfreshmen themselves. But by their<br />\ningenious method of electing their<br />\ndelegate, the freshmen would have<br />\nforced the upperclassmen to ratify<br />\ntheir candidate as no matter whom<br />\nthe members of the other classes<br />\nwould have nominated for freshman delegate, all the nominees would<br />\nhave resigned except the one elected<br />\nat the freshman class meeting. The<br />\nfreshmen therefore think that instead<br />\nof being accused .of deplorable ignorance, they should be given credit for<br />\nhaving shown the most foresight of<br />\nany class that has ever entered this<br />\ninstitution, as they were the first to<br />\nfind a way of sending a delegate<br />\nelected by themselves to the Board of<br />\nGovernors of the Athletic Association.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI. \u2014 American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.

The prospects are, however, nothing to boast<br />\nof. Of last year's team, there arc<br />\njust five men left: Clary, Stockett,<br />\nKlein, Keith, and Schmeisser. The<br />\nmen who had a good chance of making the team last year have been<br />\nworking faithfully. One or two<br />\nFreshman have also taken an interest<br />\nin the game.
