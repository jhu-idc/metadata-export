The blame<br />\nfor this sorry state of affairs rests with both groups, and<br />\nevery effort should be made to cease from this innane<br />\nbehavior.<br />\nSecondly, we note that by relegating the Code to a<br />\ntrivial level the Council has seriously undermined the<br />\nCode's efficacy. The SC activities of the past week are an<br />\nexample of this. There was no necessity for the Council<br />\nto try the petty offense of stealing a flag at a football<br />\ngame. The very value of the Code lies partly in the<br />\nlatitude of action it allows a Hopkins student. The Code<br />\nshould only be invoked when the infraction warrants<br />\nserious action. Otherwise there will never be a shred of<br />\nrespect for the Gentlemen's Code.<br />\nThe attitude of many SC members in this and other<br />\ninstances clearly shows their complete detachment from<br />\nthe reality of student behavior. It should be recognized<br />\nthat college students do not and cannot act in accordance<br />\nwith the idealized and unrealistic image of a Gentleman<br />\ndesired by certain members of our Hopkins community.<br />\nThe welter of trivia passed in recent years by the SC<br />\nand DSRC testify to this fact. If a moral robot is desired<br />\nthen we should apply to Pavlov and Skinner and abandon<br />\nthe Gentlemen's Code.<br />\nThis particularizing of the Gentlenten's Code stems<br />\nin part from the undue concern with publicity and public<br />\nrelations which manifests itself throughout all levels of<br />\nthe University. A reading of the version of the Gentlemen's Code contained in the present SC constitution reveals that \"The Honor system governs... those aspects<br />\nof behavior among students on the campus, or at the<br />\nlocation of campus-sponsored activities, which might in<br />\nany way compromise or undermine the present valued<br />\nethical concept of Hopkins men.\" But in the proposed<br />\nversion of the Gentlemen's Code Commission we find<br />\nthat its jurisdiction has been enlarged to world wide<br />\ncoverage extending through all vacations. One wonders<br />\nif we won't have to sign out to relieve the University of<br />\nresponsibility for our behavior after we graduate.<br />\nIn conclusion we can only reiterate that we do not<br />\ndisagree with the conception of a campus wide judicial<br />\nhoard. On the contrary, we initiated this idea in an editorial last spring. But we do take exception with the concepts and methods being used to accomplish this end.<br />\nWe would suggest that both the DSRC and SC begin to<br />\nthink before they act, that they consider the philosophy<br />\nunderlying the Gentlemen's Code, and that they act appropriately.<br />\n<br />\nBravo!<br />\nThe fraternity men among us should react with<br />\npride in regard to the latest listing of their averages.<br />\nWhile the top fraternity has equaled its performance of<br />\nlast year, the majority of fraternities have considerably<br />\nimproved their levels of scholarship. A point in fact is<br />\nthat one fraternity raised its average a tenth of a point<br />\nhut dropped two places in the listing. We would also<br />\nguess that the overall fraternity average has echoed this<br />\ntrend and gone up considerably from last year. These<br />\nfacts should help dispell the well worn conundrum that<br />\nmembership in a fraternity hurts marks. Quite obviously<br />\nthe Hopkins fraternities are mark conscious and effectively work to improve their grades.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, DECEMBER 1, 1961<br />\n<br />\nNew Library To House Book<br />\nCollection Of JHU Founder<br />\nIt is hard to say whether or not Mr. Johns<br />\nHopkins, founder of a great university, had the<br />\ntypical undergraduate student in mind when he<br />\nacquired for his private collection such books as<br />\nthose entitled Woman Physiologically Considered,<br />\nSleep, and Professional Anecdotes.

The main criticism<br />\nof the BIA so far this year, Cioni<br />\nexplained, has been that there<br />\nhasn't been enough publicity<br />\ngiven to the schedule of the<br />\ngames and as a result several<br />\nteams,<br />\nespecially<br />\nfraternity<br />\nteams, did not show up for their<br />\nscheduled Fall sports games.<br />\nCioni admitted that the BIA<br />\nwas partly to blame for the<br />\nmissed games as a result of poor<br />\npublicity, but he added; \"Ten<br />\ndays before the Fall program,<br />\na meeting of all team athletic<br />\nmanagers was held and a schedule for the entire season was<br />\npresented; Some of the fraternity athletic managers did not<br />\ninform the fraternity of its<br />\nschedule of games.

Cioni added that he<br />\nwould like to see the same thing<br />\ndone in football and lacrosse,<br />\nbut he felt that the referees<br />\nwould probably have to be paid<br />\nby the teams themselves.<br />\nIn an attempt to clarify certain BIA rulings, Cioni stated<br />\nthat there are no forfeits allowed in the Fraternity leagues<br />\nand, if a team forfeits 25% of<br />\nits games, it will be dropped<br />\nfrom the league.

The blame<br />\nfor this sorry state of affairs rests with both groups, and<br />\nevery effort should be made to cease from this innane<br />\nbehavior.<br />\nSecondly, we note that by relegating the Code to a<br />\ntrivial level the Council has seriously undermined the<br />\nCode's efficacy. The SC activities of the past week are an<br />\nexample of this. There was no necessity for the Council<br />\nto try the petty offense of stealing a flag at a football<br />\ngame. The very value of the Code lies partly in the<br />\nlatitude of action it allows a Hopkins student. The Code<br />\nshould only be invoked when the infraction warrants<br />\nserious action. Otherwise there will never be a shred of<br />\nrespect for the Gentlemen's Code.<br />\nThe attitude of many SC members in this and other<br />\ninstances clearly shows their complete detachment from<br />\nthe reality of student behavior. It should be recognized<br />\nthat college students do not and cannot act in accordance<br />\nwith the idealized and unrealistic image of a Gentleman<br />\ndesired by certain members of our Hopkins community.<br />\nThe welter of trivia passed in recent years by the SC<br />\nand DSRC testify to this fact. If a moral robot is desired<br />\nthen we should apply to Pavlov and Skinner and abandon<br />\nthe Gentlemen's Code.<br />\nThis particularizing of the Gentlenten's Code stems<br />\nin part from the undue concern with publicity and public<br />\nrelations which manifests itself throughout all levels of<br />\nthe University. A reading of the version of the Gentlemen's Code contained in the present SC constitution reveals that \"The Honor system governs... those aspects<br />\nof behavior among students on the campus, or at the<br />\nlocation of campus-sponsored activities, which might in<br />\nany way compromise or undermine the present valued<br />\nethical concept of Hopkins men.\" But in the proposed<br />\nversion of the Gentlemen's Code Commission we find<br />\nthat its jurisdiction has been enlarged to world wide<br />\ncoverage extending through all vacations. One wonders<br />\nif we won't have to sign out to relieve the University of<br />\nresponsibility for our behavior after we graduate.<br />\nIn conclusion we can only reiterate that we do not<br />\ndisagree with the conception of a campus wide judicial<br />\nhoard. On the contrary, we initiated this idea in an editorial last spring. But we do take exception with the concepts and methods being used to accomplish this end.<br />\nWe would suggest that both the DSRC and SC begin to<br />\nthink before they act, that they consider the philosophy<br />\nunderlying the Gentlemen's Code, and that they act appropriately.<br /><br />\nBravo!<br />\nThe fraternity men among us should react with<br />\npride in regard to the latest listing of their averages.<br />\nWhile the top fraternity has equaled its performance of<br />\nlast year, the majority of fraternities have considerably<br />\nimproved their levels of scholarship. A point in fact is<br />\nthat one fraternity raised its average a tenth of a point<br />\nhut dropped two places in the listing. We would also<br />\nguess that the overall fraternity average has echoed this<br />\ntrend and gone up considerably from last year. These<br />\nfacts should help dispell the well worn conundrum that<br />\nmembership in a fraternity hurts marks. Quite obviously<br />\nthe Hopkins fraternities are mark conscious and effectively work to improve their grades.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, DECEMBER 1, 1961<br /><br />\nNew Library To House Book<br />\nCollection Of JHU Founder<br />\nIt is hard to say whether or not Mr. Johns<br />\nHopkins, founder of a great university, had the<br />\ntypical undergraduate student in mind when he<br />\nacquired for his private collection such books as<br />\nthose entitled Woman Physiologically Considered,<br />\nSleep, and Professional Anecdotes.

The main criticism<br />\nof the BIA so far this year, Cioni<br />\nexplained, has been that there<br />\nhasn't been enough publicity<br />\ngiven to the schedule of the<br />\ngames and as a result several<br />\nteams,<br />\nespecially<br />\nfraternity<br />\nteams, did not show up for their<br />\nscheduled Fall sports games.<br />\nCioni admitted that the BIA<br />\nwas partly to blame for the<br />\nmissed games as a result of poor<br />\npublicity, but he added; \"Ten<br />\ndays before the Fall program,<br />\na meeting of all team athletic<br />\nmanagers was held and a schedule for the entire season was<br />\npresented; Some of the fraternity athletic managers did not<br />\ninform the fraternity of its<br />\nschedule of games.
