The fact,<br />\nnevertheless, remains that the whole idea of the affair originated not<br />\nwith an enthusiastic outburst of student spirit, but was instituted at<br />\nthe request of Mr. Iddins, Business Manager of the University. Connected intimately as he is with the finances of athletics, we cannot<br />\naccept the view that his idea in holding the parade was entirely without<br />\nregard for the gate receipts. Why should the Business Manager of<br />\nthe University assume as his task the bolstering of student enthusiasm<br />\nfor the team? That duty belongs to the cheer leaders and yet this<br />\nplan did not emanate from them, but comes through them from<br />\nanother source.<br />\nGenuine spirit, such as was shown in the impromptu celebration<br />\nbefore the St. John's game is an entirely sincere display of loyalty to<br />\nour team, but when the whole thing is a carefully planned piece of<br />\npropaganda, there is no show of college loyalty involved.<br />\nAccepting the assumption that the parade is commercial in purpose,<br />\nit tests with the undergraduate body as to whether or not it wishes to be<br />\nmade an advertising medium.

This season should be<br />\none of particular rejoicing for our own Hopkins campus, for within a<br />\ntwelfth-month, momentous doings have taken place in connection with<br />\nthe growth of the University.<br />\nThe reins of government of Johns Hopkins have changed hands.<br />\nNo more wise selection could have been possible than the elevation of<br />\nDr. Ames to the Presidency. He is in every way able to carry on the<br />\nwork which Gilman, Remsen, and Goodnow have pursued before him.<br />\nLet everyone give thanks that we have been so fortunate to have<br />\nDr. Ames as our President.<br />\nMomentous strides concerned with the enlargement of the University<br />\nhave been taken. The Wilmer Institute, the Welch Library, the Department of the History of Medicine and the founding of a Chair of<br />\nChemical Education have all added to the already varied activities of<br />\nthe University.<br />\nThe Homewood campus has been physically enriched by the addition<br />\nof two new buildings, the Physics Building and Levering Hall. The<br />\nInstitute for the Study of Law has been assured of a permanent home<br />\nand the Carroll Mansion has been restored to its former glory. Gradually, the campus is achieving the dignity of appearance befitting the<br />\nmagnitude of its accomplishments in more humble quarters.<br />\nEven we undergraduates should feel grateful that our own position<br />\nin the University remains fairly secure. There are still a sufficient<br />\nnumber of courses to keep us occupied to a reasonable degree. The<br />\nNew Plan has not completely swallowed us.<br />\nWith such thoughts let us consume the traditional turkey on Thursday, mindful of the blessings which are ours.<br />\nP. W.

However, if you consider this<br />\nMaryland Parade from a sane and logical viewpoint, we believe you<br />\nwill come to the same conclusion as we already have.<br />\nThe parade, we are told, is not commercial in its purpose. The fact,<br />\nnevertheless, remains that the whole idea of the affair originated not<br />\nwith an enthusiastic outburst of student spirit, but was instituted at<br />\nthe request of Mr. Iddins, Business Manager of the University. Connected intimately as he is with the finances of athletics, we cannot<br />\naccept the view that his idea in holding the parade was entirely without<br />\nregard for the gate receipts. Why should the Business Manager of<br />\nthe University assume as his task the bolstering of student enthusiasm<br />\nfor the team? That duty belongs to the cheer leaders and yet this<br />\nplan did not emanate from them, but comes through them from<br />\nanother source.<br />\nGenuine spirit, such as was shown in the impromptu celebration<br />\nbefore the St. John's game is an entirely sincere display of loyalty to<br />\nour team, but when the whole thing is a carefully planned piece of<br />\npropaganda, there is no show of college loyalty involved.<br />\nAccepting the assumption that the parade is commercial in purpose,<br />\nit tests with the undergraduate body as to whether or not it wishes to be<br />\nmade an advertising medium. If the student body supports the parade<br />\nit will more than likely be like any other parade of former years, for<br />\nthe taint of commercialization does not intrude on the actual merrymaking. The decision now rests with us underegraduates. We shall<br />\nnot attempt to dissuade anyone from participating if he is actually<br />\nconvinced of the sincerity of the project.<br /><br />\nTHANKSGIVING 1929<br />\nHURSDAY, we shall all gather round the festive board to give<br />\nthanks for the harvests of another year. This season should be<br />\none of particular rejoicing for our own Hopkins campus, for within a<br />\ntwelfth-month, momentous doings have taken place in connection with<br />\nthe growth of the University.<br />\nThe reins of government of Johns Hopkins have changed hands.<br />\nNo more wise selection could have been possible than the elevation of<br />\nDr. Ames to the Presidency. He is in every way able to carry on the<br />\nwork which Gilman, Remsen, and Goodnow have pursued before him.<br />\nLet everyone give thanks that we have been so fortunate to have<br />\nDr. Ames as our President.<br />\nMomentous strides concerned with the enlargement of the University<br />\nhave been taken. The Wilmer Institute, the Welch Library, the Department of the History of Medicine and the founding of a Chair of<br />\nChemical Education have all added to the already varied activities of<br />\nthe University.<br />\nThe Homewood campus has been physically enriched by the addition<br />\nof two new buildings, the Physics Building and Levering Hall. The<br />\nInstitute for the Study of Law has been assured of a permanent home<br />\nand the Carroll Mansion has been restored to its former glory. Gradually, the campus is achieving the dignity of appearance befitting the<br />\nmagnitude of its accomplishments in more humble quarters.<br />\nEven we undergraduates should feel grateful that our own position<br />\nin the University remains fairly secure. There are still a sufficient<br />\nnumber of courses to keep us occupied to a reasonable degree. The<br />\nNew Plan has not completely swallowed us.<br />\nWith such thoughts let us consume the traditional turkey on Thursday, mindful of the blessings which are ours.<br />\nP. W. S.<br /><br />\nThe Freshmen this year have<br />\nplayed several games. The first of<br />\nthe season was a victory for the<br />\nFrosh over the Friends School<br />\nteam.
