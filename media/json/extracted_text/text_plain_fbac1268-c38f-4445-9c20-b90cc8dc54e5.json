Andrew Cohen's<br />\narticle \"Such a Great Shame\" is a good example of a<br />\nwriter taking a cheap shot at a program he knows<br />\nabsolutely nothing about. It would be a mistake to<br />\ndignify the article by pointing out each obvious flaw, but<br />\nits intent needs to be attacked.<br />\nHow do you calculate the success of an athletic<br />\nprogram at Hopkins? Andrew Cohen's yardstick could be<br />\nused to measure a Division One football team, but to<br />\njudge the Johns Hopkins football team by the number of<br />\nfans in the stands or even the won-lost record is to<br />\ncompletely lose perspective on what Hopkins athletics is<br />\nall about. The football program at Hopkins is a vehicle by<br />\nwhich a group of students can expand their college<br />\nexperience beyond just academia. It's an opportunity for<br />\nthem to do something which very few students have the<br />\nchance to do. That's why the Athletic Department at<br />\nHopkins is geared to the student as a participant, not as a<br />\nspectator as in a big-time athletic program. They have to<br />\nbe students and athletes, not either/or, and the time<br />\ninvolved forces them to sacrifice the degree of excellence<br />\nthey could achieve if they specialized in one or the<br />\nother.Nobody likes to lose. We know\u2014we played on<br />\nwinners and losers at Hopkins. But when these players<br />\nlook back on their careers it won't be the number of fans<br />\nin the stands or the won-lost record that stick out in their<br />\nminds as much as the experience of actually competing.<br />\nIt's too easy for the Andrew Cohens of the world to<br />\nhurl their gutless barbs at these athletes, to call them<br />\n\"disrfial\" and \"worthless, and worst of all to attack the<br />\ncoaches who make a career out of providing students with<br />\nathletic opportunities. It was Theodore Roosevelt who<br />\nsaid, \"It is not the critic who counts. nor the man who<br />\npoints out where the strong man stumbled, nor where the<br />\ndoer of deeds could have done them better.

Illustrated 302 pages. Grove Press,<br />\nNew York, Ten dollars. Available at JHU (Follett)<br />\nBookcenter.<br />\nThere is, one would suppose, a certain<br />\namount of the voyeur in us all; a degree of impolite<br />\ncuriosity that makes reading other people's mail or<br />\ndiaries so amazingly delightful. Of course, most of us can<br />\ncover for our fetish, murmuring something convincingly<br />\nacademic about, \"it's, you know, research.\" But, just as<br />\ngossip often masquerades as news, so too are the motives<br />\nof many scholars less honorable.(One thinks with a sense<br />\nof bemusement of Richard Elliman's inclusion of some,<br />\nbut not all, of Joyce's racier letters to his wife, which he<br />\ndismisses in his scholarly fashion as \"sexual surrogates\"<br />\nfor the then-parted Joyces. Making these available for<br />\ncomparison to the pornography used in Ulysses seems<br />\nstraightforward enough reasoning from a scholastic<br />\nperspective, yet one cannot ignore their entertainment<br />\npotential at parties.)<br />\nIn that sense, the Ginsberg journals are a<br />\ndisappointment. One expects to read page upon page of<br />\nanecdotes about Kerouac, Burroughs, Carr and Casady,<br />\nbut finds little of any real interest. Rather than relate day<br />\nto day events, and leave the reader with a sense of the<br />\nperiod and those people, Ginsberg (and, to an extent,<br />\nBall, through his editorial powers of exclusion) leaves us<br />\nwith a reflective, yet not totally illuminating portrait of<br />\nAllen Ginsberg.<br />\nThe description of a chance encounter with Welsh poet<br />\nDylan Thomas serves as an example. The reader is told<br />\nthat the account was set to paper a mere forty-five<br />\nminutes after Ginsberg had left Thomas in a cab. Ginsberg<br />\ndescribes the episode in a rambling, chronological<br />\nsequence of notes, recalling bits of conversation, chunks<br />\nof atmosphere.<br />\nUnfortunately, there is little of Dylan Thomas in the<br />\naccount. Apart from his apparent desire to watch two<br />\ngirls \"do a trick,\" there is little insight. Rather, what we<br />\nsee is Allen Ginsberg, the young poet, who is so eager to<br />\nimpress the celebrity he has chanced upon that he winds<br />\nup getting thrown out of a bar, considers getting two:<br />\nfriends to perform the \"trick\" Thomas appears interested<br />\nin,and finishes the evening alone, feeling rather foolish.<br />\n<br />\nBut after all, these are journals, not memoirs. Even<br />\nthough there are conversations sprinkled throughout, the<br />\norientation of the book is intensely personal, yet<br />\nsomehow enough removed from the singularity of<br />\nGinsberg's own existence to be of intere-t to the general<br />\nreading public.<br />\nAnd, of course, there is that spectre of academe, the<br />\nvariant reading, whichmakes the journal a sure-seller<br />\namong graduate students anxiously poring over Kaddish<br />\nfor some hint of elucidation. Many first versions appear<br />\nin the journals, with helpful footnotes or references in the<br />\nReader's Guide (a concise and generally helpful preface<br />\nprepared by Gordon Ball) which allow the reader to<br />\nlocate the later works in which their polished versions<br />\nappear.<br />\n<br />\nFor many, and this reviewer especially, the high point<br />\nof the journals may well be the many dream records<br />\nGinsberg kept. Generally bizarre, typically packed with a<br />\nbrilliant, surrealistic energy, these dream records almost<br />\nmake a case that Ginsberg the dreamer is by far more<br />\ninteresting than Ginsberg the poet.<br />\nOne could go on. There are some delightful bawdy<br />\n;ongs, some set to alarmingly innocent melodies (e.g.,<br />\n\"On the Good Ship Lollipop\"). There is Ginsberg's<br />\nsurprisingly detailed account of his first peyote<br />\nexperience. And there are also several exquisite portraits,<br />\niverbal sketches of random scenes that seem almost more<br />\nalive than their characters.<br />\nIn short, a marvelous book, easily suited to a single,<br />\ndevouring read, or a continuous series of satisfying snacks.<br />\n<br />\nBarth: something with a spark of eternity<br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br />\n<br />\nE<br />\n<br />\nver since that fateful day in the Garden of Eden, man<br />\nhas looked at nature and asked,\"How?\" In the beginning<br />\ncave dwellers believed in a god of natural disasters, and in,<br />\nthe twentieth century their descendants are combing the<br />\nunconscious to comprehend the nature of man himself.<br />\nTraditionally, two philosophies have existed to define the<br />\nunknown: mathematics and art. Although these two types<br />\nof intuition appear widely different, they have always<br />\nbeen linked. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,<br />\n'Poets like John Donne, for example, described the \"music<br />\nof the spheres\" to reflect medieval Platonic scientific<br />\ntheories and also constructed rhymed couplets about<br />\nNewton's recently discovered laws of falling bodies. In<br />\nother words, math and art use different structures to<br />\nexplain the same phenomenon, but structure is essential<br />\nto both.<br />\nStructured writing has also existed since the beginning<br />\nof languages. Primitive, passed-around-the-campfire stories<br />\ncentered on the heroic deeds of the individual or group.<br />\nApproaching modern times, frame stories like One<br />\nThousand Nights and a Night, Decameron, and The<br />\nCanterbury Tales organized diverse moral and folk tales.<br />\nEdgar Allan Poe revolutionized the genre when he<br />\nrejected the eighteenth century's ambling, birth-to-death<br />\nrogue biographies in favor of rising tide of action, quick<br />\nclimax, and short denouement. The twentieth century<br />\nhas introduced a wide variety of styles, including<br />\nexistential, but structure has always remained important.<br />\nIn a reading and lecture for \"Contemporary American<br />\nLetters\" students on October 24, Hopkins Writing<br />\nSeminars Professor John Barth explained his use of a<br />\nSpiral structure in his novella \"Perseid\" in Chimera. At the<br />\nbeginning of<br />\nhis talk, Mr. Barth spoke of a connection<br />\netwe en<br />\ndreams and writing. His emphasis on<br />\nconstraints\" quickly dispelled any thought that fantasy<br />\nis u pstructured. In \"Perseid,\" a melange of mythic and<br />\n.s<br />\nLillocleTtr<br />\ntlletnes, Mr. Barth uses a \"logarithmic spiral\" as<br />\nill Primary motif. First, he explained the story of writing<br />\nthis<br />\nstory within a story; his seven (or more) reasons for<br />\nWriting Chimera arose from another, longer work entitled<br />\n<br />\n.LETTERS; Mr. Barth wanted to include two myth-based<br />\nnovellas in this larger collection. The project seemed to<br />\n' have spiralled away with him, however, and he decided to<br />\ninclude a third novella. The Chimera stones get<br />\nprogressively longer; the third's length is equal to the<br />\n\u2022 combined lengths of the first two.<br />\nThe \"Perseid\" story line weaves back and forth in epic<br />\nfashion. Traditionally, epic tales begin-near the climax<br />\nand flash back and forth, mingling past and present. In<br />\n\"Perseid\" the action is more complex because the story<br />\nbegins six-sevenths of the way to the end and meanders<br />\nthrough Perseus' deeds, reminisces of his deeds, and<br />\npresent adulation as a god via a series of life- recording<br />\nnurals, similar to those seen by the hero of the Aeneid.<br />\nThe panels spiral around the room (his bed is in the<br />\nvortex), each panel becoming progressively longer. The<br />\nframe that shows his heroic deeds of outwitting the gray<br />\nladies, 'beheading Medusa, rescuing Andromeda, and<br />\nturning the wicked court to stone is divIled into seven<br />\nparts. The seven motif seems as inescapable as the spiral,<br />\nwhich twists into the !ceiling the bed, and even the<br />\nattendant nymph's navel. The spiral may also represent<br />\n<br />\nthe hero's midlife crisis, his endless rehashing of the good<br />\nold days. After all, when orie is a hero, there may be<br />\nnowhere to go but down\u2014and into a spirillic tailspin.<br />\nDuring the question and answer session, Mr. Barth<br />\nexpounded some of his writing philosophy. Although he<br />\nsays he prefers simple stories, he sets upon increasingly<br />\ncomplicated tasks because \"I don't think life is simple ;...I<br />\nprefer a kind of complexity.\" He tapped his own feelings<br />\nabout middle age in \"Perseid.\" Writing is a \"metaphor for<br />\nour everyday actions; the passion has to be there through<br />\nsome dialogue of what you experience.\" Mr. Barth's<br />\nreading manner is forceful and fluid. His voice rises and<br />\nfalls with the action and commentary, and he emphasizes<br />\nword choice and word play. He writes very tightly, using a<br />\nwide range of precise vocabulary, alliteration, and<br />\nverbified nouns. His words combine humor, seriousness,<br />\nand story.<br />\nThe Greeks made their gods superhuman, yet in their<br />\nown image. In the same vein man-made fictiorrs truer than<br />\nlife, yet fantasy is often closer to reality than journalism.<br />\nIn \"Perseid\" John Barth has combined myth and life to<br />\ncreate something with a spark of the eternal.<br />\nRecent Arrivals at the Bookcenter<br />\nHardback:<br />\nSurprise!

Cornelius Melody's parents were<br />\nIrish peasants<br />\nwho gained possession of a castle there, and<br />\nas a consequence of their sudden prosperity, Cornelius<br />\nWas raised as a gentleman, reading Lord Byron's poetry<br />\nand riding with the hunt. Even though he developed a<br />\nsense of his aristocratic character, it could not have been a<br />\nst uing,<br />\nlasting sense, for he cannot forget that his parents<br />\n\u00b0,,hce lived in the mud With pigs running through the door.<br />\nBt<br />\ntiielody,<br />\n-i<br />\nat least for a time, escaped their dreary past,<br />\nfirst in the Irish<br />\ncastle, and then as a major, fighting under<br />\nthe Duke of<br />\nWellington at the battle of Talavera.<br />\nFor some reason never fully explained in the play,<br />\nMelody settled<br />\nin Massachusetts, where, it seems, debts<br />\nS000<br />\n0on accumulated. He is left a poor innkeeper,<br />\nsurrounded by<br />\nthe rich Yankees who scorn him and the<br />\nPoor Irish<br />\nhe himself scorns. Melody, his wife and<br />\nau ghter, recollect his former, nobler life, and much of<br />\ntheu,<br />\npathos of the play derives from their intense<br />\n(l_wareness of an irremedial gap between a glorious past<br />\nand a squalid<br />\npresent.<br />\nTo some extent, of course, the past has been idealized,<br />\n,<br />\nelody's triumphs exaggerated, but he did live in a castle,<br />\noe Ivas publicly praised by Wellington. Now, as the play<br />\ni tPerls, Melody is, to put it politely, an innkeeper, to put<br />\nbluntly,<br />\na saloonkeeper, and instead of Wellington<br />\noff<br />\neu,ng his praise there is only a fellow7veteran of the<br />\nSpanish<br />\ncampaign, a corporal at that, who toadies the old<br />\ntnaior.<br />\nThe part of Melody's wife, Nora, is played by Geraldine<br />\nitZ<br />\n6clatd, and a delight she must no doubt be, but<br />\non the night I attended A Touch of the<br />\nrh<br />\noet, her role was played by understudy Louisa Horton.<br />\n.Poet,<br />\nere<br />\nis, of course, something admirable about an<br />\nHuuierstudy stepping in at the last minute and--at least in<br />\ndfilms like All About Eve-- stealing the show<br />\noilg<br />\ns vi<br />\nwow<br />\nhue:<br />\nit, but such was hardly the case with Luuisa<br />\n<br />\nHorton. Her voice was not always clear, probably bectise<br />\nshe spoke much too softly. There wasn't nearly enough<br />\nfeeling in her voice, not even in those dramatic<br />\nconfrontations between mother and daughter which<br />\nrequire something beyond a vocal monotone. Instead,<br />\nHorton seemed to be doing little more than reciting the<br />\nlines.<br />\nIt was fortunate, at least on a night when Geraldine<br />\nFitzgerald was absent, that Cornelius and his daughter<br />\nhave much larger, more important, roles than Nora, and I<br />\ncouldn't help mentally cheering when, in Act Three,<br />\nCornelius shd to Nora, \"Oh be quiet. Go back to your<br />\nkitchen.\"<br />\nOne advantage, I suppose, of a weak Nora on this<br />\nparticular night, was the further concentration it placed<br />\nupon the relationship between Melody and his daughter,<br />\nwhich is, after all, the focus of A Touch of the Poet.<br />\nSurely it's hard to imagine any actor or actress stealing<br />\nthe show from Robards, but Kathryn Walker, as Melody's<br />\ndaughter Sara, certainly gives an impressive performance.<br />\n(She has, incidently, appeared with Robards in two<br />\ntelevision specials, The House Without A Christmas Tree<br />\nand Thanksgiving Treasure.) When Sara, with her clear,<br />\n<br />\nTouch<br />\nof<br />\nthe Poet<br />\nstrong, brassy voice talks to her mother, the flat, lifeless<br />\ntone of Nora's voice becomes painfully obvious. True,<br />\nNora is supposed to be a relatively passive, maternal<br />\nfigure, but there is simply no conviction in Nora's lines as<br />\nspoken, and consequently, whenever Nora and Sara<br />\nconverse, which is often, one hardly notices Nora's<br />\npresence, and it seems more a long monologue on Sara's<br />\npart, broken by pauses--Nora's lines--and then resumed,<br />\nsort of Molly Bloom's closing monologue in Ulysses with<br />\nNora as the ellipses.<br />\nThe plot is propelled forward when dreamy<br />\nrecollections of past wealth and glory are replaced by a<br />\npresent opportunity to regain wealth and prestige. If Sara,<br />\nplayed by Kathryn Walker with a boldness and insolence<br />\nreminiscent of Colleen Dewhurst's portrayals of O'Neill<br />\nwomen, can scheme successfully and marry Simon<br />\nHarford, the poet (but more importantly, a rich poet)son<br />\nof an established--at least by American standards--Yankee<br />\nfamily, the castle is regained, so to speak.<br />\nSimon, the potential saviour of Sara from her life as a<br />\nbarmaid, is, potentially, the most important character in<br />\nthe outcome of the play, but he is never seen or heard,<br />\neven though he is lying--doing what?--for over three hours<br />\n<br />\ndavid<br />\n<br />\nporter<br />\n<br />\naccording to our watches, an entire day according to the<br />\nlour acts, on an upstairs bed at the inn, nursed by Sara for<br />\na case of pneumonia contracted while living a<br />\nWaldenesque existence in a shack rented from another<br />\npoet, Major Melody.<br />\nHis mother, played by Betty Miller, arrives at the inn,<br />\ndressed in a flowing white gown, determined to ascertain<br />\nwhat her blue blood son is doing here in the lower depths.<br />\nMelody, somewhat drunk and less than courteous, makes<br />\na pass, to which she responds with venom. Not<br />\nsurprisingly, when Mrs. Harford meets Sara she warns her<br />\nnot to marry her son.<br />\nMelody, becoming progressively drunker, as the long<br />\nday journeys into night, decides to celebrate the<br />\nanniversary of Talavera by dressing up in his military<br />\nuniform--red shirt, white pants, black boots. When<br />\nCornelius, in this outfit, adopts a self-conscious poetic<br />\nstance and recites from Byron, he has a stiff, gruff, stagy<br />\nintensity, that's wonderfully funny when done by<br />\nRobards, who makes the audience acutely aware of the<br />\nextent to which Melody's-pretensions of grandeur are just<br />\nthat: pretensions, a role to play. Melody's belief (or at<br />\nany rate, his will to believe) in his own gentility, is truly<br />\npathetic, and as the action progresses, the roleplaying of<br />\nthe uniformed Melody becomes more intense.<br />\nThe Simon family, quite naturally, wants nothing to do<br />\nwith Irish barmaids and drunkards, so they send a lawyer,<br />\nGadsby (played by George Ede), to Melody with an offer<br />\nof S3,000 in cash if Sara renounces all claim to the Simon<br />\nscion, and if the Melody family moves further westward,<br />\npreferably to Ohio. Understandably insulted by the offer,<br />\nMelody, in the best chivalric tradition, rushes to the<br />\nHarford estate with a challenge for a duel, despite the fact<br />\nthat, as Sara reminds him, dueling is now illegal. He will,<br />\nas Sara foresees, be thrown out by the servants and the<br />\npolice, without having laid a hand on Harford.<br />\nDisillusioned, Melody destroys his prized mare,<br />\nrenounces Lord Byron's poetry, vows never to wear the<br />\nmilitary uniform again, and staggers into the bar to rub<br />\nshoulders and raise a mug with the riff-raff; he goes so far<br />\nas to renounce his aristocratic preference for Van<br />\nBuren<br />\nin the upcoming presidential election and endorse<br />\nthe<br />\ncommoner Andrew Jackson.<br />\nSara may still win young Simon, but she realizes the<br />\nintensity of her identification with her father's dreams<br />\nand pretences of a nobler life beyond the bar-room walls.<br />\nThe finest scenes are those between father and daughter,<br />\nparticularly in the third act, when Cornelius and Sara<br />\nargue, standing at opposite ends of a long bar table.<br />\nCornelius banging his chair on the floor to emphasize his<br />\nevery point, calling his own daughter \"Slut\" and<br />\n\"Whore,\" drawing real shudders from the audience.<br />\nsomething tew actors ever achieve.<br />\nThose are the moments, the scenes, that make<br />\nthis<br />\nproduction of A Touch of the Poet worthwhile, and even<br />\nif the play is still too lengthy and wordy,even if Robards<br />\nis at times perhaps a bit too stiff and mannered, there<br />\nremains in memory an image of Cornelius banging that<br />\nchair with each indictment of his daughter, there remains<br />\nin memory Sara's brogue--her full, earthy, healthy<br />\noutcries.<br />\nA Touch of the Poet will continue at the Mechanic<br />\nthrough November 8. Then it will be on the road for six<br />\nmore weeks before going on Broadway.<br />\n<br />\n\f-L'ttLr,<br />\n<br />\n1 y t ilic 82.

Portraits! in Prints: From Diirer to Warhol<br />\nis comprised of about seventy etchings, engravings,<br />\nwoodcuts and lithographs.<br />\nThe earliest prints in this exhibit are by Albrecht<br />\nDiirer, a sixteenth century German who was one of the<br />\nfirst artists to attend seriously to portraiture.. Two of his<br />\nengravings appear in this collection. These prints are the<br />\nCardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg (also called The Small<br />\nCardinal) from Dilrer's middle period and a later work,<br />\nFrederick the Wise (1524). The exhibition continues<br />\nchronologically, featuring the works of Rembrandt,<br />\nFrench Impressionists, Matisse,<br />\nIngres, Daumier,<br />\nPicasso, and Warhol.<br />\nSeveral themes are prominent in this grouping. Many of<br />\nthe artists chose other artists for their subjects: there are<br />\nportraits of Titian, Rubens, Watteau, Berthe Morisot,<br />\nSIC 0C\\ILOS SIC II,LE GENAS SIC \u2022<br />\nManet,1 Whistler, and Puvis de Chavannes ( a minor<br />\n\u00b0 ORA. \u00b0 FE REBAT \u00b0<br />\n7\u00b0.: NO \u2022 ETATIS SVE *XXIX<br />\nImpressionist painter). Also included are portraits of<br />\nM 1.1<br />\nX I X.<br />\nwriters and composers by their contemporaries. Examples<br />\nare Renoir's lithograph of Richard Wagner, Rodin's,<br />\ndrypoint of Victor Hugo, two portraits of Edgar Allan Erich Heckel, all dating from the early twentieth century.<br />\nPoe (one wood engraving by Felix Vallotton and another A later Rockwell Kent lithograph is also included.<br />\nThe exhibition is very interesting for its historical<br />\netching by Manet) and Gauguin's 1891 etching of the<br />\nrepresentation of the evolution of portraiture. Particularly<br />\nsymbolist poet Stephane Mallarme.<br />\nThree of the German Expressionist works represented important are the artists' interpretations of their subjects.<br />\nare self-portraits of Max Klinger, Max Beckmann, and Degas' Portrait of Edouard Mane! (1864) depicts Milner<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nas a contemplative, even saddened indiviudal. On the<br />\nother hand, Nicholson's portrait of James Whistler, from<br />\nthe early twentieth century, represents the artist as very<br />\nself-assured, almost arrogant. He stands with his head<br />\ntilted back, one eyebrow raised, glaring down toward the<br />\nviewer. Rockwell Kent's self-portrait is unusually<br />\ndisturbing: his bald head is turned toward the viewer's<br />\nright, and he stares, his eyes piercing the viewer, as if to<br />\nintimidate or warn him.<br />\nIn preparing a woodcut, sections of a block of wood<br />\nare carved away. The ink adheres to the raised parts that<br />\nremain, and thus forms the design. In an engraving, the ink<br />\nis held in the grooves made by the incision of a \"burin\"<br />\ninto a metal plate. When the edges of the grooves have<br />\nbeen smoothed, the ink is rubbed in, the surface is wiped<br />\nclean and the impression is made on moistened paper<br />\nunder very high pressure.<br />\nAn etching differs from an engraving in that lines<br />\ndrawn with an etching needle are bitten with acid. The<br />\ndesign is formed in wax ground applied over the metal<br />\nplate, which is then subjected to a series of acid bitings.<br />\nThe plate is inked, wiped, and then printed.<br />\nAn aquatint is a particular type of etching, produced<br />\nby a process in w hich a mordant acid is made to bite not<br />\nonly lines, but also tonal areas in the metal plate. The<br />\nresult resembles watercolor in its tonal effects (hence, the<br />\nname aquatint). Mezzotints and drypoints are different<br />\ntypes of engravings. A mezzotint is a process of engraving<br />\ncommonly practiced in the eighteenth century to emulate<br />\nthe tonal qualitites of a painting. A metal plate, usually<br />\ncopper or steel, is roughened with a rocking tool which<br />\nmakes indentations and raises a burr. The burr is scraped<br />\naway where lighter tones in the design are desired. In a<br />\ndrypoint the burr is allowed to remain, producing a soft,<br />\nvelvety effect.<br />\nPage 17<br />\n<br />\nPerahia provides angelic Schubert<br />\nBY J.D. CONSIDINE<br />\nRecently, it has been very fashionable for all sorts of<br />\nsoloists to become conductors. Daniel Barenboim, the<br />\nconcert pianist, took up the baton several years back, and<br />\nnow seems almost reluctant to return to his keyboard;<br />\ntrumpet virtuoso Gerard Schwarz has recently decided tei<br />\nforsake his instrument in favor of the pleasures of the<br />\npodium; and of course we are all virtually inundated with<br />\nprogress reports on maestro Rostropovich, who, in the<br />\nBarbirollian tradition, has risen from his cello to take on<br />\nthe duties of orchestral conductor.<br />\nConductor as Superstar? was how Harold C. Shonberg<br />\nof the New York Times rhetorically posed the question,<br />\nand indeed it seems that the man with the baton has the<br />\ngreatest impact and stature in the music world today<br />\n(after all, haven't more people heard of Bernstein than<br />\nBerman?).<br />\nThus, it comes as a bit of a surprise to learn that pianist<br />\nMurray Perahia, who appeared at the Shriver Hall Concert<br />\nthis past Saturday, was trained as a conductor, yet<br />\ndecided instead to make his living as a concert pianist.<br />\nA wise choice indeed, for Murray Perahia is<br />\nunquestionably one of the most intelligent, aesthetically<br />\npleasing pianists on the scene today. His conception is<br />\nclear, his articulation precise, and his shading impeccable.<br />\nAll in all, an almost perfect musician.<br />\nMr. Perahia opened the program with the Beethoven<br />\nSonata No. 4 in E-flat (Op. 7), a piece which is not<br />\ncommonly played in recitals. Although it lacks the<br />\nbravura appeal of the better-known sonatas (one thinks of<br />\nthe Appassionata), it is none the less a virtuostic work,<br />\nrelying on dramatic contrast rather than technical<br />\nsplendor.<br />\nMost of us are familiar with the concept of<br />\n\"orchestral\" piano playing, a technique through which<br />\nthe piano is pushed to its limits of timbre and colouring.<br />\nPerhaps because of his training as a conductor, Murray<br />\nPerahia has an almost sublime sense of the colouristic<br />\neffects obtainable upon his keyboard.<br />\nBrilliant, brass-like bursts are played off against<br />\nflowing, literally breathing legato passages. One could not<br />\nhelp but sit awestruck, literally lost in the stunning<br />\ndynamic contrasts of his Beethoven. The conception was<br />\nalmost symphonic; perhaps a bit too romantic for that<br />\nparticular piece, but breathtakingly beautiful nonetheless.<br />\nUnfortunately, this reviewer had a few problems with<br />\nthe Chopin. Mr. Perahia performed all four Impromptus,<br />\nand, on the whole, they were delightfully played. One<br />\nfelt, though, that he was straining for his sound at points<br />\n(a colleague observed that he played with the music stand<br />\nin place, which would have dampened the sound some<br />\nwhat), and the resounding fortissimo in the Impromptu<br />\nOp. 51 seemed forced.<br />\nCertainly, he expects a sound of no little ferocity to<br />\nemerge from the piano at that point, yet is it too much to<br />\n<br />\nask that a pianist play with strength, not mere Piunt<br />\nforce? To be sure, if a bear like Lazar Berman can play<br />\nloudly without resorting to clangor, an artist as sensitive<br />\nas Mr. Perahia can do better than that.<br />\nRedemption came,soon enough, however, in an<br />\neffortlessly deft rendition of the Fantasie Impromptu, Op.<br />\n74, which was given a crisp, precise, yet graceful<br />\ntreatment. A perfect marriage of tempi and dynamics, it<br />\nwas certainly the best of the Chopin.<br />\nLike a true showman, however, Mr. Perahia saved the<br />\nbest for last. Closing the concert with the Schubert Sonata<br />\nin A (Op. Post., D.959), he gave an angelic treatment to<br />\nan angelic piece, amply showing that Schubert is one of<br />\nthe truest delights of the piano repetoire.<br />\n<br />\nut course, it one remains true to the composer's<br />\nconception, it is nearly impossible to give a performance<br />\nof the Schubert that would not be a delight. Yet Mr.<br />\nPerahia transcended mere notes, and came forth with a<br />\nreading that struck the soul as well as the ear. Even<br />\nthough he seemed to tire towards the end of the<br />\nperformance (yet after playing with such intensity<br />\nthroughout, who among us would have the strength to<br />\npersist?), his emotional and aesthetic visualisation of the<br />\nSonata carried the performatice successfully.<br />\nIt is not often that a performer does a composer the<br />\njustice Mr. Perahiaiseems to lavish, and thus one can only<br />\nwait in anxious anticipation for his return.<br />\n<br />\nPettersson piece premieres<br />\ncomposition premiered in 1875 with violinist Pablo (IC<br />\nSarasate s(for whom Lab o composed several concertos), it<br />\nwas received with great applause, and it has remained a<br />\nSergiu Comissiona prefaced the Baltimore Symphony's<br />\nstandard in the violin repertory.

Pettersson has been suffering<br />\n-though he wrote other romantic, ethnic compositions.<br />\nfrom rheumatoid arthritis since the 1960's, and as a result<br />\nRomanticizations of Spain were in vogue at the time,<br />\nhas been largely confined to his home. Despite these<br />\nwhether in Gustave Dore prints and drawings of gypsies<br />\nphysical ailments, when Comissiona visited him last year<br />\nsinging and dancing, Prosper Merimee's stories about bull<br />\nhe was impressed with both the vigor of Pettersson's mind<br />\nrings and Andalusian romances, or the premiere of Bizet s<br />\nand the quality of his most recent music.<br />\nCarmen a m?nth after the premiere of Symphonic'<br />\nIndeed, Comissiona is the leading interpreter of<br />\nEspagnoL<br />\nPettersson's work, to such an ex tent that Comissiona<br />\nOne Spanish dance, the Malaguena, characterizes the<br />\nconducted the world premiere of Pettersson's Symphony<br />\nof Lalo's Symphonic Espagnol, because the<br />\nmovements<br />\nNo. 9, a work dedicated to Comissiona, who, by the way,<br />\nthe measure in a thousand ways,<br />\nsyncopate<br />\ndancers<br />\nwith<br />\nthe<br />\nit<br />\nSymphony.<br />\nGothenburg<br />\nhas recorded<br />\nstrin king a variety of rhythms with their heels. VioliniSt<br />\nPettersson's Symphony No. 8 was recorded yesterday by<br />\nPinchas Zukerman had a very,. poor start. Although his<br />\nComissiona and the Baltimore Symphony, funded by a<br />\nhigh notes were clean and crisp, the lower notes were<br />\ngrant from the Swedish government.<br />\noften coarse, grainy. He did, however, improve<br />\nThe Eighth Symphony, which Maestro Comissiona<br />\nconsiderably as the work proceeded, and by the end be<br />\ncalled \"a masterpiece,\" is in two movements and lasts<br />\nwas ably executing passages and changing rhythms, so<br />\nnearly forty-five minutes. Somber, introspective, almost<br />\nthat at the conclusion of the piece he was given a lengthY<br />\nclaustrophobic at times, it seems the sort of melancholic<br />\novation. The final piece, Maurice Ravel's Daphnis and<br />\nwork an artist confined to a garret would produce. One<br />\nChloe: Suite No. 2, is another orchestral standard. lis<br />\nway Pettersson achieves this effect is through the use of<br />\ndreamy, pastoral nature was in contrast to the somber<br />\nlong, protracted passages from the lower strings, with an<br />\nPettersson and the lively Symphonic Espagnot Hero<br />\nalmost total absence of first ,violins.

And so<br />\nriding, gaunt faces spread semi-conscious against the<br />\nwindows, minds propped up by half-rqad newspapers of the<br />\ngrimy blur of passing buildings.<br />\nSilence the chief communicant, the deadened glare of<br />\ncrowd consciousness consuming each passenger until all<br />\nbecome blurred, the multifaced continuum of seats, floors,<br />\nwindows, engine, driver.

Now wearing no.<br />\n11,for Johns Hopkins Joes was a<br />\nrunning back last year, but, in<br />\nHead Coach Denny Cox's words,<br />\nhe was determined to be a<br />\nquarterback.\"<br />\nHe got his chance two weeks<br />\nago in the game against Widener,<br />\n'n which he suc- successfully<br />\ncompleted 11 of 23 attempts for<br />\n125 total passing yards.<br />\nCoach Cox has nothing but<br />\nPraise for his new quarterback.<br />\nJoel is an immense competitor,\"<br />\n<br />\nthe Head Coach said in an<br />\ninterview a few days after the<br />\nWidener contest, \"he is a leader<br />\nby example, and the team<br />\nresponds well to him. He did an<br />\nexcellent job against Widener.\"<br />\nIn talking about that game<br />\nJoel felt that \"it could have gone<br />\neither way. If we had scored on<br />\nour last possession we could have<br />\nwon the game.'. He connected<br />\nwith Joe Devlin for 6 of those<br />\ncomplete passes, but he goes to<br />\nall of his receivers including<br />\n\"Bert\" Bender and Bruce Caine,<br />\nwhom he describes as a \"fantastic<br />\nathelete.\"<br />\nAssistant Coach Willie Scroggs<br />\ncalls all the plays for the<br />\nquarterback, but Joel likes to<br />\npass and run the option play<br />\nwhen he can.<br />\nConcerning the controversial<br />\neditorial appearing in last week's<br />\nNews Letter Joel said that he was<br />\nnever quoted directly anywhere<br />\nin the Baltimore Sun article. He<br />\nsaid that all he really wanted to<br />\nsay was that \"winning breeds<br />\n'confidence.\" He s noncommittal<br />\nabout charges of ineptitude<br />\n<br />\nagainst Coach Cox, and states<br />\nsimply that he is \"a very<br />\ndedicated coach, and I don't<br />\nthink that there is anything he<br />\nwouldn't do to produce a<br />\nwinning football .team.\" In<br />\nreference to the assistant<br />\ncoaches, Joel believes that \"they<br />\nare doing as best they can.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nAs leader of the offense in the<br />\nfirst victory for JHU this year,<br />\ndefeating Georgetown 27-20 here<br />\non Homewood field, Joel did not<br />\nget many chances to utilize the<br />\nair attack, but nevertheless<br />\ncompleted 3 of 5 passes. He felt<br />\nthat the biggest factor<br />\ncontributing to the win was the<br />\nstrength of the offensive line and<br />\nthe fine running of Bernie Cook<br />\nand Kevin Kiefler.<br />\nThis week Joel travels with the<br />\nrest of the squad up to<br />\nBethlehem, Pennsylvania, for a<br />\nSaturday match-up against<br />\nMoravian College.

This should lead to.<br />\nbalanced play within the league<br />\nand the Jays' tough schedule<br />\noutside the league should prepare<br />\nthem well for games late in the<br />\nseason.<br />\n<br />\nwhich came off a cross pass from<br />\nright wing George Coutros, which<br />\ndeflected off fellow<br />\nfrontlinesman Larry McGowan.<br />\n<br />\nand again fired the ball, this time<br />\ninto the right-hand corner of the<br />\nnet to give the team its 2-0<br />\nvictory.<br />\n<br />\nIn second half action, the Blue<br />\nJays moved \u2022 the ball well and<br />\nplayed equally as strong<br />\ndefensively.

Once again sophomore<br />\ntake this record with them when<br />\nthey travel to Moravian College<br />\nJoel Hansen started as the Jay<br />\nsignal caller and guided the<br />\ntomorrow to \u2022 take on these<br />\ngridders of Pennsylvania, who<br />\noffense. In the limited passing<br />\ngame, Hansen completed 3 out of<br />\nsport an identical 1-5 mark.<br />\nLast Saturday's contest started .5 throws for 38 yards. On the<br />\nground Coach Denny Cox was<br />\nout as if the Jays would have to<br />\nforced to employ the services of<br />\ntake defeat once again as the<br />\nlinebackers Kevin Keefer and<br />\nHoyas jumped to an early 14-0<br />\nTom Meurer in place of the<br />\nlead by connecting on their first<br />\ninjured starters, Ken Bess, John<br />\ntwo offensive drives. Faced with<br />\nRailey, and Jerry Faraino. The<br />\na third and sfort yardage<br />\nkey to the running game was the<br />\nsituation, Hoya quarterback Bob<br />\nplay of freshman back Bernie<br />\nSitz rolled out to the left side of<br />\nCook who carried the ball 18<br />\nthe Hopkins defense. Just before<br />\ntimes for 110 yards, one<br />\nhe was tackled, Sitz pitched the<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nball out to junior halfback Andy<br />\nThe first Blue Jay tally came<br />\nBlood who raced 83 yards down<br />\nearly in the second stanza when<br />\nthe sidelines for the score. In<br />\nKeefer capped off a superb<br />\ntheir next turn wit' the ball, the<br />\n<br />\nsteffen burns<br />\n<br />\noffensive drive with a two yarn<br />\nrun off tackle. The extra point<br />\nattempt by senior Bob DeSim one<br />\nwent astray and the score stood<br />\nat 14-6. Minutes later the Hoya<br />\npunter mishandled a snap from<br />\ncenter and the Jays recovered the<br />\nball deep in Georgetown<br />\nterritory. The other replacement,<br />\nMeurer, this time took the short<br />\nplunge for the score. Following a<br />\ntwo point conversion run by<br />\nHanse, the Jays found themselves<br />\ntied with the Hoyas ag the first<br />\nhalf expired.<br />\nBlue Jay defense looked<br />\nparticularly strong on key third<br />\ndown pl,ays. Sophmore John<br />\n<br />\nScully led the defense with 11<br />\ntackles.<br />\nOn their first drive in the<br />\nsecond half the Jays took the<br />\n'lead for good when frosh Cook<br />\nbroke for a 56 yard touchdown<br />\nrun. This time DeSimone<br />\nconverted and the Homewood<br />\nboys led by the count of 21 to 14.<br />\nThe fourth quarter offered some<br />\nintense excitement for the fatns<br />\nwho turned out for the game.<br />\nBack Andy Blood scored his<br />\nsecond TD of the afternoon off a<br />\nfive yard run. In stead of settling<br />\nfor a possible tie at that time,<br />\nSitz and the Hoyas looked for<br />\nthe two extra points and the<br />\n<br />\nlead. A tough Jay defense broke<br />\nup the attempted conversioni<br />\nand the Jays continued to lead,<br />\nthis time 21-20.<br />\nHopkins extended their margin<br />\nof victory late in the game when<br />\nKeefer busted the Hoya defensive<br />\nline and galloped 50 yards for his<br />\nsecond touchdown of the<br />\ncontest. A fine defensive effort<br />\nand a key penalty call that called<br />\nback an apparent Hoya score<br />\nhelped the Jays hold on and take<br />\nthe victory.<br />\nSenior co-captain Doober<br />\nAburn expressed the magnitude<br />\nof the victory for the team. \"It<br />\nwas a big game for us to win.\"'<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Runners Never Looked Better<br />\nThe Hopkin's cross country<br />\nhas never looked better, and the<br />\nseason isn't even over yet. With<br />\none regular season meet to go<br />\nthis weekend at Franklin<br />\nMarshall, the record is 11-2.<br />\nThe team is coming off a<br />\nfour-win streak going into what<br />\nwill be the toughest race of the<br />\nyear on Saturday. The only loss<br />\nwas against Ursinus at<br />\nCollegeville, Pennsylvania on<br />\nOctober 8. Dickinson in that<br />\ntri-meet proved to be no<br />\nchallenge. Senior med student<br />\nBill Caldwell from Monteagle,<br />\nTennessee, came in first overall,<br />\nblowing away Joe Figurelli from<br />\nUrsinus. The problem in the<br />\nscoring came when the next man<br />\nfor Hopkins was freshman<br />\nCharles Grice, nearly a minute<br />\nand a half behind Caldwell. Grice<br />\nsewed up the sixth slot with<br />\nother Hopkins runners coming in<br />\n8th,14th and 15th.'<br />\nThe week after that obvious<br />\ndisappointment was probably the<br />\neasiest the team was to have for<br />\nthe rest of the season. Western<br />\nMaryland was here on Wednesday<br />\nthe 11th. The score of Hopkins.<br />\n21, and Western Maryland 38 is<br />\nactually no indication of how<br />\nbadly they were beaten. Coach<br />\nRandy Cockey did not even run<br />\ntwo of the top runners, Bill<br />\nCaldwell and Charles Grice.<br />\nCaptain Bob Alworth came in<br />\nfirst followed by sophomore Tim<br />\nWhitcombe in third. Freshman<br />\nBrian Hall took the fourth slot.<br />\nCoach Cockey is quite impressed<br />\n<br />\nHaverford and Washington<br />\nColleges were here on Parent's<br />\nWeekend. Again, another victory<br />\nfor the Hop. Cockey had<br />\nexpected a greater challenge from<br />\nthe two teams. \"I expected<br />\nHaverford to be tougher. With<br />\nCaldwell, Grice and Kennedy<br />\nfinishing 1-2-3, we were assured<br />\nof a team victory no matter<br />\nwhere the other runners placed.<br />\nAgain, it was a significant team<br />\nvictory.\"<br />\n<br />\nwith Ha;1. \"He's shown<br />\nsignificant improvement. As a<br />\nmatter of fact, Brian has<br />\nimproved his time on the home<br />\ncourse by over three minutes.\"<br />\nTom Dannals, David Stewart, and<br />\nRicky Swieca also assisted in the<br />\nscoring.<br />\nThat Saturday proved to be<br />\nanother victory against Towson<br />\nand Gallaudet at Towson.<br />\nLebanon Valley came here on<br />\nWednesday the 18th expecting to<br />\nwin. Jim Kennedy, captain for<br />\nthe Hopkins team, probably ran<br />\none of the best races of his<br />\ncareer. The course was<br />\nlengthened by 1/4 mile in<br />\npreparation for the<br />\nchampionships which will be held<br />\n<br />\nWith this race, the entire team<br />\nhas.been approaching the typesof<br />\nrunning that they are able to do.<br />\nThe freshmen are now helping<br />\nout seniors Caldwell, Alworth<br />\nand Kennedy. According to the<br />\ncoach, Grice is now beginning to<br />\ndo the running of which he is<br />\ncapable. And David Stewart has<br />\nshown marked improvement.<br />\nA victory this weekend at<br />\nFranklin & Marshall will mean a<br />\n<br />\n12-2 record, the best in Hopkins'<br />\nhistory. -Cockey feels -that the<br />\nentire season has come down to<br />\nthe wire.with this meet. \"We<br />\neither do it or we don't.\"<br />\nKennedy feels that the team<br />\nhas nothing to lose this weekend.<br />\n\"They won't be expecting a<br />\ntough meet. They have been<br />\nwiping team after team. But their<br />\nfront runners haven't been reallY<br />\npressured yet. We'll either do as<br />\nthey expect or really surprise<br />\nthem. It'll be a super meet.\"<br />\nNo matter what happens this<br />\nweekend or next at the<br />\nchampionships, this has been a<br />\ntremendous year for the<br />\ncross-country team. Cockey feels<br />\nthat it is all due to the<br />\ntremendous runners that the<br />\nteam has been blessed with this<br />\nseason. \"It's all attributed to<br />\ngood runners. Their dedication in<br />\nterms of miles run and pain<br />\nendured has paid off.\"<br />\n<br />\non November 5th at Lebanon<br />\nValley. If Kennedy's time for the<br />\nextra quarter of a mile was<br />\nsubtracted from his overall time<br />\non the 5.95 mile course, it would<br />\nhave broken the record held by<br />\nBrian Goss of Franklin &<br />\nMarshall. Coach Cockey had this 1SportsSchedule for Oct. 27<br />\nto say about Kennedy's Football: The Blue Jays will take their 1-5 record to face Moravian<br />\nperformance: \"It was the best College tomorrow at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania at 1:30 pm.

However, in the face<br />\nof student and faculty<br />\nOpposition, action was put off<br />\nuntil this year when a committee<br />\nformed to investigate the<br />\nProgram's feasibility.<br />\nAccording to Dr. James<br />\nReardon -Anderson, committee<br />\nmember and Asian Studies<br />\nProfessor, \"Revenue is certainly<br />\nonly one reason for doing this.<br />\nThe<br />\nmore important question is:<br />\nu<br />\nshould we be doing this?\" He<br />\nsaid that the committee must<br />\ndetermine whether establishing<br />\nan evening college is a legitimate<br />\nfunction of The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nMany students feel that the<br />\nProgram is a moneymaking<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nrf<br /><br />\n14<br />\nL<br /><br />\nscheme which will mar the<br />\nschool's prestige and hamper<br />\nstudent employment<br />\nopportunities. Peter Satris, SAIS<br />\nstudent and committee member,<br />\nsaid, \"We're selling the SAIS<br />\nname. We're just printing<br />\ndegrees.\"<br />\nMr. Satris added, \"People are<br />\nreally worried about getting jobs.<br />\nWe still have about thirty people<br />\n(last year's graduates) who have<br />\nnot found jobs since June. The<br />\ngovernment bureaucracy can<br />\nonly take so many.\" Students<br />\nalso fear that evening graduates<br />\nwould have less trouble finding<br />\njobs because they would tend to<br />\nhave more work experience than<br />\ngraduates of the full-time<br />\nprogram.<br />\nMr. Satris also feels that the<br />\nevening college will have lower<br /><br />\nstandards.

It would be a mistake to<br />\ndignify the article by pointing out each obvious flaw, but<br />\nits intent needs to be attacked.<br />\nHow do you calculate the success of an athletic<br />\nprogram at Hopkins? Andrew Cohen's yardstick could be<br />\nused to measure a Division One football team, but to<br />\njudge the Johns Hopkins football team by the number of<br />\nfans in the stands or even the won-lost record is to<br />\ncompletely lose perspective on what Hopkins athletics is<br />\nall about. The football program at Hopkins is a vehicle by<br />\nwhich a group of students can expand their college<br />\nexperience beyond just academia. It's an opportunity for<br />\nthem to do something which very few students have the<br />\nchance to do. That's why the Athletic Department at<br />\nHopkins is geared to the student as a participant, not as a<br />\nspectator as in a big-time athletic program. They have to<br />\nbe students and athletes, not either/or, and the time<br />\ninvolved forces them to sacrifice the degree of excellence<br />\nthey could achieve if they specialized in one or the<br />\nother.Nobody likes to lose. We know\u2014we played on<br />\nwinners and losers at Hopkins. But when these players<br />\nlook back on their careers it won't be the number of fans<br />\nin the stands or the won-lost record that stick out in their<br />\nminds as much as the experience of actually competing.<br />\nIt's too easy for the Andrew Cohens of the world to<br />\nhurl their gutless barbs at these athletes, to call them<br />\n\"disrfial\" and \"worthless, and worst of all to attack the<br />\ncoaches who make a career out of providing students with<br />\nathletic opportunities. It was Theodore Roosevelt who<br />\nsaid, \"It is not the critic who counts. nor the man who<br />\npoints out where the strong man stumbled, nor where the<br />\ndoer of deeds could have done them better.

Illustrated 302 pages. Grove Press,<br />\nNew York, Ten dollars. Available at JHU (Follett)<br />\nBookcenter.<br />\nThere is, one would suppose, a certain<br />\namount of the voyeur in us all; a degree of impolite<br />\ncuriosity that makes reading other people's mail or<br />\ndiaries so amazingly delightful. Of course, most of us can<br />\ncover for our fetish, murmuring something convincingly<br />\nacademic about, \"it's, you know, research.\" But, just as<br />\ngossip often masquerades as news, so too are the motives<br />\nof many scholars less honorable.(One thinks with a sense<br />\nof bemusement of Richard Elliman's inclusion of some,<br />\nbut not all, of Joyce's racier letters to his wife, which he<br />\ndismisses in his scholarly fashion as \"sexual surrogates\"<br />\nfor the then-parted Joyces. Making these available for<br />\ncomparison to the pornography used in Ulysses seems<br />\nstraightforward enough reasoning from a scholastic<br />\nperspective, yet one cannot ignore their entertainment<br />\npotential at parties.)<br />\nIn that sense, the Ginsberg journals are a<br />\ndisappointment. One expects to read page upon page of<br />\nanecdotes about Kerouac, Burroughs, Carr and Casady,<br />\nbut finds little of any real interest. Rather than relate day<br />\nto day events, and leave the reader with a sense of the<br />\nperiod and those people, Ginsberg (and, to an extent,<br />\nBall, through his editorial powers of exclusion) leaves us<br />\nwith a reflective, yet not totally illuminating portrait of<br />\nAllen Ginsberg.<br />\nThe description of a chance encounter with Welsh poet<br />\nDylan Thomas serves as an example. The reader is told<br />\nthat the account was set to paper a mere forty-five<br />\nminutes after Ginsberg had left Thomas in a cab. Ginsberg<br />\ndescribes the episode in a rambling, chronological<br />\nsequence of notes, recalling bits of conversation, chunks<br />\nof atmosphere.<br />\nUnfortunately, there is little of Dylan Thomas in the<br />\naccount. Apart from his apparent desire to watch two<br />\ngirls \"do a trick,\" there is little insight. Rather, what we<br />\nsee is Allen Ginsberg, the young poet, who is so eager to<br />\nimpress the celebrity he has chanced upon that he winds<br />\nup getting thrown out of a bar, considers getting two:<br />\nfriends to perform the \"trick\" Thomas appears interested<br />\nin,and finishes the evening alone, feeling rather foolish.<br /><br />\nBut after all, these are journals, not memoirs. Even<br />\nthough there are conversations sprinkled throughout, the<br />\norientation of the book is intensely personal, yet<br />\nsomehow enough removed from the singularity of<br />\nGinsberg's own existence to be of intere-t to the general<br />\nreading public.<br />\nAnd, of course, there is that spectre of academe, the<br />\nvariant reading, whichmakes the journal a sure-seller<br />\namong graduate students anxiously poring over Kaddish<br />\nfor some hint of elucidation. Many first versions appear<br />\nin the journals, with helpful footnotes or references in the<br />\nReader's Guide (a concise and generally helpful preface<br />\nprepared by Gordon Ball) which allow the reader to<br />\nlocate the later works in which their polished versions<br />\nappear.<br /><br />\nFor many, and this reviewer especially, the high point<br />\nof the journals may well be the many dream records<br />\nGinsberg kept. Generally bizarre, typically packed with a<br />\nbrilliant, surrealistic energy, these dream records almost<br />\nmake a case that Ginsberg the dreamer is by far more<br />\ninteresting than Ginsberg the poet.<br />\nOne could go on. There are some delightful bawdy<br />\n;ongs, some set to alarmingly innocent melodies (e.g.,<br />\n\"On the Good Ship Lollipop\"). There is Ginsberg's<br />\nsurprisingly detailed account of his first peyote<br />\nexperience. And there are also several exquisite portraits,<br />\niverbal sketches of random scenes that seem almost more<br />\nalive than their characters.<br />\nIn short, a marvelous book, easily suited to a single,<br />\ndevouring read, or a continuous series of satisfying snacks.<br /><br />\nBarth: something with a spark of eternity<br />\nBY ROS RESNICK<br /><br />\nE<br /><br />\nver since that fateful day in the Garden of Eden, man<br />\nhas looked at nature and asked,\"How?\" In the beginning<br />\ncave dwellers believed in a god of natural disasters, and in,<br />\nthe twentieth century their descendants are combing the<br />\nunconscious to comprehend the nature of man himself.<br />\nTraditionally, two philosophies have existed to define the<br />\nunknown: mathematics and art. Although these two types<br />\nof intuition appear widely different, they have always<br />\nbeen linked. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,<br />\n'Poets like John Donne, for example, described the \"music<br />\nof the spheres\" to reflect medieval Platonic scientific<br />\ntheories and also constructed rhymed couplets about<br />\nNewton's recently discovered laws of falling bodies. In<br />\nother words, math and art use different structures to<br />\nexplain the same phenomenon, but structure is essential<br />\nto both.<br />\nStructured writing has also existed since the beginning<br />\nof languages. Primitive, passed-around-the-campfire stories<br />\ncentered on the heroic deeds of the individual or group.<br />\nApproaching modern times, frame stories like One<br />\nThousand Nights and a Night, Decameron, and The<br />\nCanterbury Tales organized diverse moral and folk tales.<br />\nEdgar Allan Poe revolutionized the genre when he<br />\nrejected the eighteenth century's ambling, birth-to-death<br />\nrogue biographies in favor of rising tide of action, quick<br />\nclimax, and short denouement. The twentieth century<br />\nhas introduced a wide variety of styles, including<br />\nexistential, but structure has always remained important.<br />\nIn a reading and lecture for \"Contemporary American<br />\nLetters\" students on October 24, Hopkins Writing<br />\nSeminars Professor John Barth explained his use of a<br />\nSpiral structure in his novella \"Perseid\" in Chimera. At the<br />\nbeginning of<br />\nhis talk, Mr. Barth spoke of a connection<br />\netwe en<br />\ndreams and writing. His emphasis on<br />\nconstraints\" quickly dispelled any thought that fantasy<br />\nis u pstructured. In \"Perseid,\" a melange of mythic and<br />\n.s<br />\nLillocleTtr<br />\ntlletnes, Mr. Barth uses a \"logarithmic spiral\" as<br />\nill Primary motif. First, he explained the story of writing<br />\nthis<br />\nstory within a story; his seven (or more) reasons for<br />\nWriting Chimera arose from another, longer work entitled<br /><br />\n.LETTERS; Mr. Barth wanted to include two myth-based<br />\nnovellas in this larger collection. The project seemed to<br />\n' have spiralled away with him, however, and he decided to<br />\ninclude a third novella. The Chimera stones get<br />\nprogressively longer; the third's length is equal to the<br />\n\u2022 combined lengths of the first two.<br />\nThe \"Perseid\" story line weaves back and forth in epic<br />\nfashion. Traditionally, epic tales begin-near the climax<br />\nand flash back and forth, mingling past and present. In<br />\n\"Perseid\" the action is more complex because the story<br />\nbegins six-sevenths of the way to the end and meanders<br />\nthrough Perseus' deeds, reminisces of his deeds, and<br />\npresent adulation as a god via a series of life- recording<br />\nnurals, similar to those seen by the hero of the Aeneid.<br />\nThe panels spiral around the room (his bed is in the<br />\nvortex), each panel becoming progressively longer. The<br />\nframe that shows his heroic deeds of outwitting the gray<br />\nladies, 'beheading Medusa, rescuing Andromeda, and<br />\nturning the wicked court to stone is divIled into seven<br />\nparts. The seven motif seems as inescapable as the spiral,<br />\nwhich twists into the !ceiling the bed, and even the<br />\nattendant nymph's navel. The spiral may also represent<br /><br />\nthe hero's midlife crisis, his endless rehashing of the good<br />\nold days. After all, when orie is a hero, there may be<br />\nnowhere to go but down\u2014and into a spirillic tailspin.<br />\nDuring the question and answer session, Mr. Barth<br />\nexpounded some of his writing philosophy. Although he<br />\nsays he prefers simple stories, he sets upon increasingly<br />\ncomplicated tasks because \"I don't think life is simple ;...I<br />\nprefer a kind of complexity.\" He tapped his own feelings<br />\nabout middle age in \"Perseid.\" Writing is a \"metaphor for<br />\nour everyday actions; the passion has to be there through<br />\nsome dialogue of what you experience.\" Mr. Barth's<br />\nreading manner is forceful and fluid. His voice rises and<br />\nfalls with the action and commentary, and he emphasizes<br />\nword choice and word play. He writes very tightly, using a<br />\nwide range of precise vocabulary, alliteration, and<br />\nverbified nouns. His words combine humor, seriousness,<br />\nand story.<br />\nThe Greeks made their gods superhuman, yet in their<br />\nown image. In the same vein man-made fictiorrs truer than<br />\nlife, yet fantasy is often closer to reality than journalism.<br />\nIn \"Perseid\" John Barth has combined myth and life to<br />\ncreate something with a spark of the eternal.<br />\nRecent Arrivals at the Bookcenter<br />\nHardback:<br />\nSurprise!

Cornelius Melody's parents were<br />\nIrish peasants<br />\nwho gained possession of a castle there, and<br />\nas a consequence of their sudden prosperity, Cornelius<br />\nWas raised as a gentleman, reading Lord Byron's poetry<br />\nand riding with the hunt. Even though he developed a<br />\nsense of his aristocratic character, it could not have been a<br />\nst uing,<br />\nlasting sense, for he cannot forget that his parents<br />\n\u00b0,,hce lived in the mud With pigs running through the door.<br />\nBt<br />\ntiielody,<br />\n-i<br />\nat least for a time, escaped their dreary past,<br />\nfirst in the Irish<br />\ncastle, and then as a major, fighting under<br />\nthe Duke of<br />\nWellington at the battle of Talavera.<br />\nFor some reason never fully explained in the play,<br />\nMelody settled<br />\nin Massachusetts, where, it seems, debts<br />\nS000<br />\n0on accumulated. He is left a poor innkeeper,<br />\nsurrounded by<br />\nthe rich Yankees who scorn him and the<br />\nPoor Irish<br />\nhe himself scorns. Melody, his wife and<br />\nau ghter, recollect his former, nobler life, and much of<br />\ntheu,<br />\npathos of the play derives from their intense<br />\n(l_wareness of an irremedial gap between a glorious past<br />\nand a squalid<br />\npresent.<br />\nTo some extent, of course, the past has been idealized,<br />\n,<br />\nelody's triumphs exaggerated, but he did live in a castle,<br />\noe Ivas publicly praised by Wellington. Now, as the play<br />\ni tPerls, Melody is, to put it politely, an innkeeper, to put<br />\nbluntly,<br />\na saloonkeeper, and instead of Wellington<br />\noff<br />\neu,ng his praise there is only a fellow7veteran of the<br />\nSpanish<br />\ncampaign, a corporal at that, who toadies the old<br />\ntnaior.<br />\nThe part of Melody's wife, Nora, is played by Geraldine<br />\nitZ<br />\n6clatd, and a delight she must no doubt be, but<br />\non the night I attended A Touch of the<br />\nrh<br />\noet, her role was played by understudy Louisa Horton.<br />\n.Poet,<br />\nere<br />\nis, of course, something admirable about an<br />\nHuuierstudy stepping in at the last minute and--at least in<br />\ndfilms like All About Eve-- stealing the show<br />\noilg<br />\ns vi<br />\nwow<br />\nhue:<br />\nit, but such was hardly the case with Luuisa<br /><br />\nHorton. Her voice was not always clear, probably bectise<br />\nshe spoke much too softly. There wasn't nearly enough<br />\nfeeling in her voice, not even in those dramatic<br />\nconfrontations between mother and daughter which<br />\nrequire something beyond a vocal monotone. Instead,<br />\nHorton seemed to be doing little more than reciting the<br />\nlines.<br />\nIt was fortunate, at least on a night when Geraldine<br />\nFitzgerald was absent, that Cornelius and his daughter<br />\nhave much larger, more important, roles than Nora, and I<br />\ncouldn't help mentally cheering when, in Act Three,<br />\nCornelius shd to Nora, \"Oh be quiet. Go back to your<br />\nkitchen.\"<br />\nOne advantage, I suppose, of a weak Nora on this<br />\nparticular night, was the further concentration it placed<br />\nupon the relationship between Melody and his daughter,<br />\nwhich is, after all, the focus of A Touch of the Poet.<br />\nSurely it's hard to imagine any actor or actress stealing<br />\nthe show from Robards, but Kathryn Walker, as Melody's<br />\ndaughter Sara, certainly gives an impressive performance.<br />\n(She has, incidently, appeared with Robards in two<br />\ntelevision specials, The House Without A Christmas Tree<br />\nand Thanksgiving Treasure.) When Sara, with her clear,<br /><br />\nTouch<br />\nof<br />\nthe Poet<br />\nstrong, brassy voice talks to her mother, the flat, lifeless<br />\ntone of Nora's voice becomes painfully obvious. True,<br />\nNora is supposed to be a relatively passive, maternal<br />\nfigure, but there is simply no conviction in Nora's lines as<br />\nspoken, and consequently, whenever Nora and Sara<br />\nconverse, which is often, one hardly notices Nora's<br />\npresence, and it seems more a long monologue on Sara's<br />\npart, broken by pauses--Nora's lines--and then resumed,<br />\nsort of Molly Bloom's closing monologue in Ulysses with<br />\nNora as the ellipses.<br />\nThe plot is propelled forward when dreamy<br />\nrecollections of past wealth and glory are replaced by a<br />\npresent opportunity to regain wealth and prestige. If Sara,<br />\nplayed by Kathryn Walker with a boldness and insolence<br />\nreminiscent of Colleen Dewhurst's portrayals of O'Neill<br />\nwomen, can scheme successfully and marry Simon<br />\nHarford, the poet (but more importantly, a rich poet)son<br />\nof an established--at least by American standards--Yankee<br />\nfamily, the castle is regained, so to speak.<br />\nSimon, the potential saviour of Sara from her life as a<br />\nbarmaid, is, potentially, the most important character in<br />\nthe outcome of the play, but he is never seen or heard,<br />\neven though he is lying--doing what?--for over three hours<br /><br />\ndavid<br /><br />\nporter<br /><br />\naccording to our watches, an entire day according to the<br />\nlour acts, on an upstairs bed at the inn, nursed by Sara for<br />\na case of pneumonia contracted while living a<br />\nWaldenesque existence in a shack rented from another<br />\npoet, Major Melody.<br />\nHis mother, played by Betty Miller, arrives at the inn,<br />\ndressed in a flowing white gown, determined to ascertain<br />\nwhat her blue blood son is doing here in the lower depths.<br />\nMelody, somewhat drunk and less than courteous, makes<br />\na pass, to which she responds with venom. Not<br />\nsurprisingly, when Mrs. Harford meets Sara she warns her<br />\nnot to marry her son.<br />\nMelody, becoming progressively drunker, as the long<br />\nday journeys into night, decides to celebrate the<br />\nanniversary of Talavera by dressing up in his military<br />\nuniform--red shirt, white pants, black boots. When<br />\nCornelius, in this outfit, adopts a self-conscious poetic<br />\nstance and recites from Byron, he has a stiff, gruff, stagy<br />\nintensity, that's wonderfully funny when done by<br />\nRobards, who makes the audience acutely aware of the<br />\nextent to which Melody's-pretensions of grandeur are just<br />\nthat: pretensions, a role to play. Melody's belief (or at<br />\nany rate, his will to believe) in his own gentility, is truly<br />\npathetic, and as the action progresses, the roleplaying of<br />\nthe uniformed Melody becomes more intense.<br />\nThe Simon family, quite naturally, wants nothing to do<br />\nwith Irish barmaids and drunkards, so they send a lawyer,<br />\nGadsby (played by George Ede), to Melody with an offer<br />\nof S3,000 in cash if Sara renounces all claim to the Simon<br />\nscion, and if the Melody family moves further westward,<br />\npreferably to Ohio. Understandably insulted by the offer,<br />\nMelody, in the best chivalric tradition, rushes to the<br />\nHarford estate with a challenge for a duel, despite the fact<br />\nthat, as Sara reminds him, dueling is now illegal. He will,<br />\nas Sara foresees, be thrown out by the servants and the<br />\npolice, without having laid a hand on Harford.<br />\nDisillusioned, Melody destroys his prized mare,<br />\nrenounces Lord Byron's poetry, vows never to wear the<br />\nmilitary uniform again, and staggers into the bar to rub<br />\nshoulders and raise a mug with the riff-raff; he goes so far<br />\nas to renounce his aristocratic preference for Van<br />\nBuren<br />\nin the upcoming presidential election and endorse<br />\nthe<br />\ncommoner Andrew Jackson.<br />\nSara may still win young Simon, but she realizes the<br />\nintensity of her identification with her father's dreams<br />\nand pretences of a nobler life beyond the bar-room walls.<br />\nThe finest scenes are those between father and daughter,<br />\nparticularly in the third act, when Cornelius and Sara<br />\nargue, standing at opposite ends of a long bar table.<br />\nCornelius banging his chair on the floor to emphasize his<br />\nevery point, calling his own daughter \"Slut\" and<br />\n\"Whore,\" drawing real shudders from the audience.<br />\nsomething tew actors ever achieve.<br />\nThose are the moments, the scenes, that make<br />\nthis<br />\nproduction of A Touch of the Poet worthwhile, and even<br />\nif the play is still too lengthy and wordy,even if Robards<br />\nis at times perhaps a bit too stiff and mannered, there<br />\nremains in memory an image of Cornelius banging that<br />\nchair with each indictment of his daughter, there remains<br />\nin memory Sara's brogue--her full, earthy, healthy<br />\noutcries.<br />\nA Touch of the Poet will continue at the Mechanic<br />\nthrough November 8. Then it will be on the road for six<br />\nmore weeks before going on Broadway.<br /><br />\n-L'ttLr,<br /><br />\n1 y t ilic 82.

Portraits! in Prints: From Diirer to Warhol<br />\nis comprised of about seventy etchings, engravings,<br />\nwoodcuts and lithographs.<br />\nThe earliest prints in this exhibit are by Albrecht<br />\nDiirer, a sixteenth century German who was one of the<br />\nfirst artists to attend seriously to portraiture.. Two of his<br />\nengravings appear in this collection. These prints are the<br />\nCardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg (also called The Small<br />\nCardinal) from Dilrer's middle period and a later work,<br />\nFrederick the Wise (1524). The exhibition continues<br />\nchronologically, featuring the works of Rembrandt,<br />\nFrench Impressionists, Matisse,<br />\nIngres, Daumier,<br />\nPicasso, and Warhol.<br />\nSeveral themes are prominent in this grouping. Many of<br />\nthe artists chose other artists for their subjects: there are<br />\nportraits of Titian, Rubens, Watteau, Berthe Morisot,<br />\nSIC 0C\\ILOS SIC II,LE GENAS SIC \u2022<br />\nManet,1 Whistler, and Puvis de Chavannes ( a minor<br />\n\u00b0 ORA. \u00b0 FE REBAT \u00b0<br />\n7\u00b0.: NO \u2022 ETATIS SVE *XXIX<br />\nImpressionist painter). Also included are portraits of<br />\nM 1.1<br />\nX I X.<br />\nwriters and composers by their contemporaries. Examples<br />\nare Renoir's lithograph of Richard Wagner, Rodin's,<br />\ndrypoint of Victor Hugo, two portraits of Edgar Allan Erich Heckel, all dating from the early twentieth century.<br />\nPoe (one wood engraving by Felix Vallotton and another A later Rockwell Kent lithograph is also included.<br />\nThe exhibition is very interesting for its historical<br />\netching by Manet) and Gauguin's 1891 etching of the<br />\nrepresentation of the evolution of portraiture. Particularly<br />\nsymbolist poet Stephane Mallarme.<br />\nThree of the German Expressionist works represented important are the artists' interpretations of their subjects.<br />\nare self-portraits of Max Klinger, Max Beckmann, and Degas' Portrait of Edouard Mane! (1864) depicts Milner<br />\n_<br /><br />\nas a contemplative, even saddened indiviudal. On the<br />\nother hand, Nicholson's portrait of James Whistler, from<br />\nthe early twentieth century, represents the artist as very<br />\nself-assured, almost arrogant. He stands with his head<br />\ntilted back, one eyebrow raised, glaring down toward the<br />\nviewer. Rockwell Kent's self-portrait is unusually<br />\ndisturbing: his bald head is turned toward the viewer's<br />\nright, and he stares, his eyes piercing the viewer, as if to<br />\nintimidate or warn him.<br />\nIn preparing a woodcut, sections of a block of wood<br />\nare carved away. The ink adheres to the raised parts that<br />\nremain, and thus forms the design. In an engraving, the ink<br />\nis held in the grooves made by the incision of a \"burin\"<br />\ninto a metal plate. When the edges of the grooves have<br />\nbeen smoothed, the ink is rubbed in, the surface is wiped<br />\nclean and the impression is made on moistened paper<br />\nunder very high pressure.<br />\nAn etching differs from an engraving in that lines<br />\ndrawn with an etching needle are bitten with acid. The<br />\ndesign is formed in wax ground applied over the metal<br />\nplate, which is then subjected to a series of acid bitings.<br />\nThe plate is inked, wiped, and then printed.<br />\nAn aquatint is a particular type of etching, produced<br />\nby a process in w hich a mordant acid is made to bite not<br />\nonly lines, but also tonal areas in the metal plate. The<br />\nresult resembles watercolor in its tonal effects (hence, the<br />\nname aquatint). Mezzotints and drypoints are different<br />\ntypes of engravings. A mezzotint is a process of engraving<br />\ncommonly practiced in the eighteenth century to emulate<br />\nthe tonal qualitites of a painting. A metal plate, usually<br />\ncopper or steel, is roughened with a rocking tool which<br />\nmakes indentations and raises a burr. The burr is scraped<br />\naway where lighter tones in the design are desired. In a<br />\ndrypoint the burr is allowed to remain, producing a soft,<br />\nvelvety effect.<br />\nPage 17<br /><br />\nPerahia provides angelic Schubert<br />\nBY J.D. CONSIDINE<br />\nRecently, it has been very fashionable for all sorts of<br />\nsoloists to become conductors. Daniel Barenboim, the<br />\nconcert pianist, took up the baton several years back, and<br />\nnow seems almost reluctant to return to his keyboard;<br />\ntrumpet virtuoso Gerard Schwarz has recently decided tei<br />\nforsake his instrument in favor of the pleasures of the<br />\npodium; and of course we are all virtually inundated with<br />\nprogress reports on maestro Rostropovich, who, in the<br />\nBarbirollian tradition, has risen from his cello to take on<br />\nthe duties of orchestral conductor.<br />\nConductor as Superstar? was how Harold C. Shonberg<br />\nof the New York Times rhetorically posed the question,<br />\nand indeed it seems that the man with the baton has the<br />\ngreatest impact and stature in the music world today<br />\n(after all, haven't more people heard of Bernstein than<br />\nBerman?).<br />\nThus, it comes as a bit of a surprise to learn that pianist<br />\nMurray Perahia, who appeared at the Shriver Hall Concert<br />\nthis past Saturday, was trained as a conductor, yet<br />\ndecided instead to make his living as a concert pianist.<br />\nA wise choice indeed, for Murray Perahia is<br />\nunquestionably one of the most intelligent, aesthetically<br />\npleasing pianists on the scene today. His conception is<br />\nclear, his articulation precise, and his shading impeccable.<br />\nAll in all, an almost perfect musician.<br />\nMr. Perahia opened the program with the Beethoven<br />\nSonata No. 4 in E-flat (Op. 7), a piece which is not<br />\ncommonly played in recitals. Although it lacks the<br />\nbravura appeal of the better-known sonatas (one thinks of<br />\nthe Appassionata), it is none the less a virtuostic work,<br />\nrelying on dramatic contrast rather than technical<br />\nsplendor.<br />\nMost of us are familiar with the concept of<br />\n\"orchestral\" piano playing, a technique through which<br />\nthe piano is pushed to its limits of timbre and colouring.<br />\nPerhaps because of his training as a conductor, Murray<br />\nPerahia has an almost sublime sense of the colouristic<br />\neffects obtainable upon his keyboard.<br />\nBrilliant, brass-like bursts are played off against<br />\nflowing, literally breathing legato passages. One could not<br />\nhelp but sit awestruck, literally lost in the stunning<br />\ndynamic contrasts of his Beethoven. The conception was<br />\nalmost symphonic; perhaps a bit too romantic for that<br />\nparticular piece, but breathtakingly beautiful nonetheless.<br />\nUnfortunately, this reviewer had a few problems with<br />\nthe Chopin. Mr. Perahia performed all four Impromptus,<br />\nand, on the whole, they were delightfully played. One<br />\nfelt, though, that he was straining for his sound at points<br />\n(a colleague observed that he played with the music stand<br />\nin place, which would have dampened the sound some<br />\nwhat), and the resounding fortissimo in the Impromptu<br />\nOp. 51 seemed forced.<br />\nCertainly, he expects a sound of no little ferocity to<br />\nemerge from the piano at that point, yet is it too much to<br /><br />\nask that a pianist play with strength, not mere Piunt<br />\nforce? To be sure, if a bear like Lazar Berman can play<br />\nloudly without resorting to clangor, an artist as sensitive<br />\nas Mr. Perahia can do better than that.<br />\nRedemption came,soon enough, however, in an<br />\neffortlessly deft rendition of the Fantasie Impromptu, Op.<br />\n74, which was given a crisp, precise, yet graceful<br />\ntreatment. A perfect marriage of tempi and dynamics, it<br />\nwas certainly the best of the Chopin.<br />\nLike a true showman, however, Mr. Perahia saved the<br />\nbest for last. Closing the concert with the Schubert Sonata<br />\nin A (Op. Post., D.959), he gave an angelic treatment to<br />\nan angelic piece, amply showing that Schubert is one of<br />\nthe truest delights of the piano repetoire.<br /><br />\nut course, it one remains true to the composer's<br />\nconception, it is nearly impossible to give a performance<br />\nof the Schubert that would not be a delight. Yet Mr.<br />\nPerahia transcended mere notes, and came forth with a<br />\nreading that struck the soul as well as the ear. Even<br />\nthough he seemed to tire towards the end of the<br />\nperformance (yet after playing with such intensity<br />\nthroughout, who among us would have the strength to<br />\npersist?), his emotional and aesthetic visualisation of the<br />\nSonata carried the performatice successfully.<br />\nIt is not often that a performer does a composer the<br />\njustice Mr. Perahiaiseems to lavish, and thus one can only<br />\nwait in anxious anticipation for his return.<br /><br />\nPettersson piece premieres<br />\ncomposition premiered in 1875 with violinist Pablo (IC<br />\nSarasate s(for whom Lab o composed several concertos), it<br />\nwas received with great applause, and it has remained a<br />\nSergiu Comissiona prefaced the Baltimore Symphony's<br />\nstandard in the violin repertory.

He did, however, improve<br />\nThe Eighth Symphony, which Maestro Comissiona<br />\nconsiderably as the work proceeded, and by the end be<br />\ncalled \"a masterpiece,\" is in two movements and lasts<br />\nwas ably executing passages and changing rhythms, so<br />\nnearly forty-five minutes. Somber, introspective, almost<br />\nthat at the conclusion of the piece he was given a lengthY<br />\nclaustrophobic at times, it seems the sort of melancholic<br />\novation. The final piece, Maurice Ravel's Daphnis and<br />\nwork an artist confined to a garret would produce.

He did an<br />\nexcellent job against Widener.\"<br />\nIn talking about that game<br />\nJoel felt that \"it could have gone<br />\neither way. If we had scored on<br />\nour last possession we could have<br />\nwon the game.'. He connected<br />\nwith Joe Devlin for 6 of those<br />\ncomplete passes, but he goes to<br />\nall of his receivers including<br />\n\"Bert\" Bender and Bruce Caine,<br />\nwhom he describes as a \"fantastic<br />\nathelete.\"<br />\nAssistant Coach Willie Scroggs<br />\ncalls all the plays for the<br />\nquarterback, but Joel likes to<br />\npass and run the option play<br />\nwhen he can.<br />\nConcerning the controversial<br />\neditorial appearing in last week's<br />\nNews Letter Joel said that he was<br />\nnever quoted directly anywhere<br />\nin the Baltimore Sun article. He<br />\nsaid that all he really wanted to<br />\nsay was that \"winning breeds<br />\n'confidence.\" He s noncommittal<br />\nabout charges of ineptitude<br /><br />\nagainst Coach Cox, and states<br />\nsimply that he is \"a very<br />\ndedicated coach, and I don't<br />\nthink that there is anything he<br />\nwouldn't do to produce a<br />\nwinning football .team.\" In<br />\nreference to the assistant<br />\ncoaches, Joel believes that \"they<br />\nare doing as best they can.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nAs leader of the offense in the<br />\nfirst victory for JHU this year,<br />\ndefeating Georgetown 27-20 here<br />\non Homewood field, Joel did not<br />\nget many chances to utilize the<br />\nair attack, but nevertheless<br />\ncompleted 3 of 5 passes. He felt<br />\nthat the biggest factor<br />\ncontributing to the win was the<br />\nstrength of the offensive line and<br />\nthe fine running of Bernie Cook<br />\nand Kevin Kiefler.<br />\nThis week Joel travels with the<br />\nrest of the squad up to<br />\nBethlehem, Pennsylvania, for a<br />\nSaturday match-up against<br />\nMoravian College. Johns Hopkins<br />\nwas wiped out last year against<br />\nthis team, but with Moravian's<br />\nloss of a key running back and of<br />\nlast year's starting quaiterback<br />\nplus the renewed confidence or<br />\nJHU, chances are good that Joel<br />\nand his Blue Jays will chalk up<br />\nvictory no. 2 of the season.<br /><br />\na.<br /><br />\nNCAA Tourney Bid?<br /><br />\ntiP<br /><br />\nBY CAROL HUBER<br /><br />\n?SI<br />\n,ce<br />\nide<br /><br />\nA strong determination to win<br />\n\u2022a bid for the NCAA<br />\nChampionship and to athieve a<br />\nfirst place finish in conference<br />\nplay spurred theBlue Jay Soccer<br />\nTeam to two shutout victories<br />\nthis week.

The only loss<br />\nwas against Ursinus at<br />\nCollegeville, Pennsylvania on<br />\nOctober 8. Dickinson in that<br />\ntri-meet proved to be no<br />\nchallenge. Senior med student<br />\nBill Caldwell from Monteagle,<br />\nTennessee, came in first overall,<br />\nblowing away Joe Figurelli from<br />\nUrsinus. The problem in the<br />\nscoring came when the next man<br />\nfor Hopkins was freshman<br />\nCharles Grice, nearly a minute<br />\nand a half behind Caldwell.

Western<br />\nMaryland was here on Wednesday<br />\nthe 11th. The score of Hopkins.<br />\n21, and Western Maryland 38 is<br />\nactually no indication of how<br />\nbadly they were beaten. Coach<br />\nRandy Cockey did not even run<br />\ntwo of the top runners, Bill<br />\nCaldwell and Charles Grice.<br />\nCaptain Bob Alworth came in<br />\nfirst followed by sophomore Tim<br />\nWhitcombe in third.

It'll be a super meet.\"<br />\nNo matter what happens this<br />\nweekend or next at the<br />\nchampionships, this has been a<br />\ntremendous year for the<br />\ncross-country team. Cockey feels<br />\nthat it is all due to the<br />\ntremendous runners that the<br />\nteam has been blessed with this<br />\nseason. \"It's all attributed to<br />\ngood runners.

Possibly it's just<br />\nPart of the samemovement that has . swarms of people<br />\nrunning, lifting weights, taking dance, yoga and TM<br />\nlessons, going to awareness workshops, and karate classes.<br />\nMany of those that don't eat meat do take part in those<br />\nactivities, but an even larger number have decided that<br />\nthey don't have to kill to nourish their bodies. It is<br />\nPossible to get all the protein, vitamins and minerals<br />\nnecessary for a complete diet in the various forms of plant<br />\nlife.<br />\nAnd in this day and age so many of the different types<br />\nOf food we eat are contaminated with an endless number<br />\n0f. chemicals. Although DDT is present in all plant life,<br />\nand none of us can really avoid having some of it in our<br />\ns)'Isrem, it is cumulative. Therefore, the meat that you eat<br />\nWill contain all the residue that was present on the plants<br />\nthat the animal ate and so on.<br />\nEven if you are still in the habit of eating meat, the<br />\nf\u00b0110wing recipes would be a great addition to any meal.<br />\nThey're simple, almost foolproof, and might even<br />\nconvince you to give up meat altogether.<br />\nSpinach Provencale<br />\n2 1b. fresh spinach<br />\nI large onion<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1 clove garlic<br />\nolive oil<br />\nbutter<br />\n2 eggs, beaten<br />\n1 cup fresh grated Parmesan cheese<br />\nsalt and pepper<br /><br />\nWash the spinach leaves carefully and the hard work is<br />\nover. Chop the onions and mince the garlic. Heat the olive<br />\noil in a very large: &amp;tie and saute the onion and garlic in<br />\nit for a few minutes. When the onion is transparent, add<br />\nthe spinach and cover tightly. In about two minutes the<br />\nspinach leaves will be reduced to a fraction of their<br />\n/ former bulk, and you can stir them in with the oil and<br />\nonions. Cook a few minutes longer and remove from the<br />\nheat.<br />\n.Butter a medium-sized baking dish. When the spinach<br />\nhas cooled slightly,stir in 2 beaten eggs and 1/2-cup of the<br />\ngrated cheese. Season with the salt and pepper to taste,<br />\nand pour themmixture in,to the baking.dish. Sprinkle the<br />\nremaining<br />\ncheese on top and dot with:15utter.

Stir in<br />\nthe egg yolks, cream, sugar, vanilla and raisins. Whisk the<br />\negg whites until fluffy and fold them into the mixture.<br />\nPour it into a well-buttered, shallow baking dish, sprinkle<br />\nthe top with some sugar and the rest of the nutmeg, and<br />\nbake in a slow oven (about 300-325 degrees) for 2-3<br />\nhours, or until it is nicelybrown on top.<br />\nServe hot or cold, with cream or custard sauce.
