The<br />\nHopkins paraders advanced in true<br />\nmilitary fashion and seemed to be<br />\nby far the best drilled of any of the<br />\n,<br />\ncollege divisions.<br />\nThe Black and Blue contingent<br />\nwas led by Freddie Lee, who was<br />\nchie,f marshal. He was assisted by<br />\nWalter D. Sutton, Jack Fulton,<br />\nBlanchard Randall and C. Leland<br />\nGetz. The big Hopkins standards<br />\nwere carried by George Y. Rusk<br />\nand Thomas S. Poole.<br />\nFrom the moment the Hopkins<br />\nmarchers fell in line until ranks<br />\nwere broken at the end of the parade, they were warmly applauded<br />\nalong the entire route of the parade.<br />\nBy the time the Hopkins division<br />\nreached President Wilson's reviewing stand it was almost dark. Although, because of the darkness, the<br />\nHopkins marchers did not show up<br />\nquite as well as they would have<br />\ndone by daylight, nevertheless,<br />\nPresident Wilson seemed to be<br />\ngreatly pleased by the fine turn-out<br />\nmade by Hopkins.<br />\nThe majority of the Hopkins paraders left for Washington on the<br />\n\"Hopkins Special,\" which pulled out<br />\nof Union Station about 8.45 A. M.<br />\nAfter reaching Washington and<br />\nmarching to the place where they<br />\nwere to assemble in the afternoon,<br />\nthe members of the party dispersed.<br />\nSome went to the capitol and waited<br />\nuntil President Wilson took his oath<br />\nof office and delivered his inaugural<br />\naddress; others went sight-seeing.<br />\nShortly after two o'clock the Hopkins marchers assembled and began<br />\nrather impatiently to wait for the<br />\nsignal to start. Numerous false<br />\nalarms were given from time to<br />\ntime, and the hopes of getting under<br />\nway were dashed to the ground.<br />\nMany of the Hopkins paraders<br />\nlooked up old friends in the ranks<br />\nof the Princeton and University<br />\nof Virginia delegations. A little<br />\naltercation with an old man in regard to standing on his lawn to view<br />\nthe parade helped to liven up things.<br />\nThrough some peculiar arrangement the University of Virginia<br />\ndelegation had its band march behind it instead of in front. This<br />\nband, which was of the co-ed variety, was the cause of considerable<br />\nmerriment. Virginia seemed to be<br />\nanxious to wish it on Hopkins and<br />\nHopkins refused to annex it. The<br />\n<br />\nAs announced in THE NEwsLETTER of January 27, Rudolf<br />\nEucken, professor of philosophy at<br />\nthe University of Jena, will deliver<br />\ntwo lectures here this week. On<br />\nMonday, March io, Professor Eucken will lecture in English on the<br />\nsubject of \"Philosophy and Religion,\" at 5 P. M.; and, at 8 P. M.,<br />\non Tuesday the 11th, he will supplement this first lecture by one in<br />\nGerman on the subject of \"Presentday Conflicts for the Worth of Human Life.\" Both of these subjects<br />\ngive free play to the wonderful<br />\nwealth of thoroughly mastered and<br />\nassimilated learning that he has at<br />\nhis command.<br />\nFor those who have not as yet<br />\nmade the acquaintance of Professor Eucken through their study of<br />\nphilosophy, THE NEWS-LETTER Will<br />\ntry briefly to state the chief points<br />\nof his idealistic philosophy.<br />\nEucken is the recognized exponent<br />\nand the principal leader of the<br />\nmovement of thought known as<br />\nvitalistic idealism. We will quote<br />\nfrom our own pages (No. 14):<br />\n\"Very few of those who are properly informed will dispute the assertion that to Eucken, more than<br />\nto any other one man, belongs the<br />\ncredit of having successfully counteracted the poisonous influence of<br />\nthe naturalism of Hegel, the pessimism of Schopenhauer, the positivism of Comte, and the subjective<br />\nemotionalism of Nietzsche, and of<br />\nsubstituting in the place of these<br />\nmisleading philosophicalspeculations<br />\na Christian Weltanshauung.\" The<br />\ndistinctive feature of Eucken's philosophy constitutes an answer to the<br />\nquestion: \"How are we to find the<br />\nright course of conduct, in order<br />\nthat, by following it, we may gain<br />\nthe truth, the reality, the higher<br />\nlife?\" Thomas Seltzer writes that<br />\nEucken teaches that \"there is evil<br />\nin the world that has to be overcome, and, hence life is a fight, a<br />\nconflict, a struggle to overcome the<br />\nevil and develop the good.\" Man<br />\nmust learn to turn away from what<br />\nis merely animal and free himself<br />\nfrom nature and from the material.<br />\nWhen he does this, he begins to live<br />\nthe spiritual life, which \"is the sole<br />\nreality of the world.\" In developing the spiritual life, man also acquires immortality. Eucken, therefore, grants immortality only to<br />\nthose who have freed themselves<br />\nfrom the temporal and attained the<br />\nspiritual life. Religion, therefore,<br />\nquite naturally holds a prominent<br />\nplace in Eucken's philosophy. Chris-<br />\n<br />\nThe senior class held its annual<br />\nbanquet o n Thursday evening,<br />\nMarch 6, at the Hotel Emerson.<br />\nThe occasion was, without doubt,<br />\na success, as all those present can<br />\nand will testify and, although, possibly not so uproarious as the last<br />\nbanquet was, nevertheless, far more<br />\nenjoyable.<br />\nAfter dinner a vote was taken to<br />\nfind out the opinion of the class<br />\nupon the stars in various lines who<br />\nwere members of the class. Mr.<br />\nGillet was voted the most popular<br />\nand the best athlete; Mr. Donoho,<br />\nthe handsomest; Mr. Getz, as the<br />\nmember who had done most for<br />\nHopkins and the man most likely<br />\nto succeed; Mr. Wolman, the wittiest; Mr. Marshall, the most rustic;<br />\nMr. Sattler, the most optimistic;<br />\nMr. Marston, the greatest ladies'<br />\nman; Mr. Ray, the most dignified;<br />\nMr. Dickinson, the brightest and<br />\nmost eccentric man; Mr. Penniman,<br />\nas the class shark (especially in<br />\nGerman), etc. After the voting had been completed, Mr. Edmund S. Donoho rose<br />\nto introduce the speakers of the<br />\nevening. The first toast was:\"Four<br />\nYears of 1913,\" by C. Leland Getz,<br />\npresident of the class. The following toasts were then given: \"Athletics,\" J. A. \"Dewey\" Penniman;<br />\n\"Our Hullabaloo,\" Julian D. Sears;<br />\n\"Witticisms by Dunlap,\" F. Merrill<br />\nHildebrandt; \"Musical Clubs,\"<br />\nEmory H. Niles;\"Dean vs. Tango;\"<br />\nA. Gus Sattler. After the regular<br />\nspeeches several informal addresses<br />\nwere made, chief of which was a<br />\nmimicking of all the members of<br />\nthe class by Mr. Gillet.<br />\nThe committee in charge of the<br />\nbanquet was composed of the following: George M. Gillet, Jr.,<br />\nchairman; G. Ellis Porter; Julian<br />\nH. Marshall; Louis L. Jacobs; J.<br />\nEdward Richardson, Jr., C. Leland<br />\nGetz.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2.)<br />\n<br />\n(('ontinued on page 8, col. 3.)<br />\n<br />\nA crowd of moderate size turned<br />\nout on Friday evening to hear the<br />\nannual interclass debate and public<br />\nspeaking contest; nor was the audience distinguished by any degree<br />\nof enthusiasm. The speaking contest was an excellent one, as has<br />\nbeen the case with the greater number of these contests in the last two<br />\nor three years. The decision was<br />\nawarded by the judges\u2014Prof. D.<br />\nM. Robinson, Prof. W. D. Mustard<br />\nand Mr. Lawrence C. Wroth\u2014to<br />\nClaude I. Uhler for his delivery of<br />\nHenry W. Grady's speech on \"The<br />\nSouthern Negro.\" His voice was<br />\neven and clear and nothing was<br />\noverdone. Practically the same remark holds true for the other contestants\u2014Millard Eiseman, Moses<br />\nBarroway and Charles S. Weech.<br />\nThe last two had unusually powerful<br />\nvoices and, perhaps, relied too much<br />\non these to carry them over places<br />\nwhere a simple, straight-forward<br />\ndeclamation, without any attempt at<br />\ndramatic delivery, would have been<br />\nmore effective. Eiseman was somewhat more successful in this respect.<br />\nAfter the Musical Clubs rendered<br />\na selection, Dr. French, as presiding officer, announced the rules of<br />\nthe debate. The juniors had the<br />\naffirmative of the question: \"Resolved, That without regard to the<br />\nobligations of the Hay-Pauncefote<br />\ntreaty the tolls of the Panama<br />\nCanal should be the same for the<br />\nmerchant vessels of all nations. It<br />\nis understood that the term 'all nations' includes the United States of<br />\nAmerica.\" Hanunond, a s first<br />\nspeaker for the affirmative, sought<br />\nto establish the fundamental propositions on which their debate rested.<br />\nSimpson elaborated these arguments<br />\nand refuted one or two statements<br />\nthe first speaker on the negative<br />\nside, M. H. Waxman, had made.<br />\nGetz brought the prepared speeches<br />\nto a close. The affirmative restricted their speeches to a few telling<br />\npoints which they Grove home at<br />\nevery opportunity; whereas, the<br />\nnegative scattered its fire somewhat,.<br />\nbringing in a variety of questions<br />\nthat had better been left untouched.<br />\nThe rebuttal speeches were well delivered, with the exception of a few<br />\ndiverting instances of mispronunciation.<br />\nAs a whole, the debate was not<br />\nequal to those of recent years. The<br />\nquestion, being a hypothetical one,<br />\nmay have been partially responsible<br />\nfor this. But neither side confined<br />\nitself strictly to the question at issue<br />\nand broached matters of ship sub-<br />\n<br />\nThe junior banquet will take place<br />\nimmediately after the Easter holidays; the exact date and place will<br />\nbe announced later.

His words were running like<br />\nscoriac rivers. The audience sat<br />\naghast. In the rear of McCoy Hall<br />\na young lady was seen to suddenly<br />\nsink backward.

First, I will take up<br />\nthe items contained in the article<br />\nregarding this matter in last week's<br />\nissue of<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThe \"turn in orders now\" sign<br />\nhas been removed from the postoffice window. It has served its<br />\npurpose, namely, to give us a more<br />\ndefinite idea of the number in demand. Each book will cost us<br />\nabout four times the selling price,<br />\nand owing to the small number that<br />\ncan possibly be sold and the heavy<br />\nfixed expenses per volume for better paper, cover, etc., increased production cannot reduce the cost to<br />\nus below the price at which the<br />\nbook is sold. We cannot afford to<br />\nsell many volumes at a sacrifice and<br />\nthus the supply will be strictly limited, not greatly to exceed the actual<br />\nnumber of orders already in. Even<br />\nnow many pages are set up in type<br />\nready for the press.<br />\nNow we come to the arrangement<br />\nof material. First, a large portion<br />\nof the advertising sections are to be<br />\nprinted up. Next in succession the<br />\nindividual histories and write-ups<br />\nmust go to press and then on<br />\nthrough the class histories, athletics,<br />\nto the end. The printer demands at<br />\nleast two months for the issue of<br />\nthe book, six weeks in the printing<br />\noffice and two weeks at the bindery.<br />\nNow as to the biographies, how<br />\nmany additions will be made from<br />\nnow to the end of the year? Very<br />\nfew, I can assure you. And as for<br />\nan inferred rebellion on the part of<br />\nthe members of the class, I can<br />\nbrand that idea of the \"individual\"<br />\nas \"preposterous\" and utter \"nonsense\"\u2014the class understands the<br />\nposition of those in charge thoroughly, I hope, and is supporting us<br />\naccordingly. The winners of the<br />\nP B K keys will not be announced<br />\nin time to go into the individual biographies, but the list will be printed in the last section to go to press.<br />\nThe winners of honorson the spring<br />\nteams are not announced usually<br />\nuntil commencement, or even afterwards, as Was the case last year.<br />\nThe articles on the spring teams<br />\nwith their write-ups will be fairly<br />\naccurate. Thus, I believe, all will<br />\nagree that the honors will be heralded abroad as fully as possible without having the staff take a summer<br />\ncourse on Hullabaloo publication.<br />\nNow, as to our aims. We, in<br />\ncharge, of all persons, must assuredly want our Hullabaloo to be<br />\nthe \"best ever,\" and such it is going<br />\nto be. We are getting out. the book<br />\nto fill a place\u2014a place that has been<br />\nfor several years but an empty tradition. 1.Ve have made rather ambitius plans as to the drawings,<br />\nideas, materials to be incorporated<br />\ninto the book and we are not selling it to make money.

Psychotechniques\u2014<br />\na sub-science of psychology\u2014makes<br />\nthe determination. The manner of<br />\nselection seems rather simple:<br />\n\"Twenty motormen of one of our<br />\nlarge cities,\" said the famous student, \"were put to test in our Harvard laboratories, and in several<br />\nminutes we were able to pick out<br />\nthe good motormen, I mean those<br />\nwho had few accidents, and the bad<br />\nones, those who were continually<br />\ncausing trouble for their employers<br />\nby careless operating of \u2022their cars.<br />\n\"The test we put them to would<br />\nperhaps appear childlike, but it succeeded. We had a table with red<br />\nand black cubes on it which epr esented pedestrians a n d vehicles.<br />\nTwo parallel lines represented a<br />\ntrack, and we had a small car that<br />\ncould be moved by turning a little<br />\ncrank. We allowed each motorman<br />\nto run the car. At times we pushed<br />\ncubes representing automobiles or<br />\npersons in front of the car. If the<br />\nimpulse of the motorman was safe<br />\nand his attention careful, he avoided<br />\na collision. A careless operator<br />\nwould hit the blocks, and the very<br />\nmen who had had accidents while<br />\nrunning cars on the streets, and we<br />\nwere able to pick out the reliable<br />\nones.<br />\n\"If the company employing the<br />\nmen had known these facts before<br />\nemploying them, some of the accidents on the line could have been<br />\naverted.\"<br />\nDr. Munsterberg also explained<br />\nhow he had examined thirty girls<br />\nfrom a telephone operating school.<br />\nThey were put to tests of accuracy,<br />\nattention, impulse and imagination.<br />\nAverages were computed, and the<br />\ngirls continued their schooling.<br />\nSome time later, when they had<br />\nfinished the training, those who had<br />\nbeen dismissed as incapable operators were the same as those Dr.<br />\nMunsterberg had found inefficient<br />\nin his tests. Each test required fifty<br />\nminutes. The schooling required a<br />\nyear, and the girls who had attended the school had been paid by the<br />\ncompany. If psychotechniqueg, the<br />\nscience of vocational guidance, had<br />\nbeen employed, contended Dr.<br />\nMunsterberg, the company would<br />\nhave saved the money paid to the<br />\ngirls while learning and the girls<br />\nwould have been able to put the<br />\ntime wasted on some vocation for<br />\nwhich they were fitted.<br />\nFollowing closely the movement<br />\nof scientific management, came that<br />\nof vocational guidance. Bureaus<br />\nhave been established in a few<br />\nplaces, where men are examined before being employed.<br />\n<br />\nEVENT<br />\n<br />\nHOLDER<br />\n<br />\nRECORD<br />\n<br />\nH M Wagner, '12<br />\n100 yds<br />\nH K Tootle, '03<br />\n220 yds.<br />\n440 yds<br />\nj T England, '02<br />\nE S Woodruff, Graduate.<br />\n880 yds<br />\nF C Lee,'12<br />\n1 mile<br />\nF C Lee,'12<br />\n2 mile<br />\n120-yd.

When two or more men hold<br />\nthe same record as, for instance, in<br />\nthe ioo-yard dash and the i6-pound<br />\nhammer, the last man to equal the<br />\nrecord is retained. Tootle, '03,<br />\nHunter, '07, and Perce, '07, have<br />\nall done To seconds in the ioo-yard<br />\ndash. Garrett, a graduate student,<br />\nfirst set the record for the hammer<br />\nthrow in 1898. Again, in the mile<br />\nrelay race outdoors, there are two<br />\nholders of the record (3m. 33s.).<br />\nIn 1901 the famous team composed<br />\nof Riggs, Whitman, Hoffman and<br />\nEngland ran the mile in the above<br />\ntime. Last year at the South Atlantic Intercollegiates, held at<br />\nHomewood, Hunter, Stiebel, Uhler<br />\nand Fulton made the identical time<br />\nwhen they finished ahead of Washington and Lee and Georgetown.<br />\nAn indoor mile relay record was established by the 'Varsity team at<br />\nthe Hopkins games in February,<br />\nbeing also the South Atlantic record<br />\n(3m. 3575s.). The team consisted<br />\nof McDonagh, Wells, Lloyd and<br />\nCatlin.<br />\nAs to the individual marks, it appears that record breaking is confined to the past five years, with a<br />\npredominance in 1911 and 1912,<br />\nand to the five years from 1900<br />\nthrough 1904.

It was a time<br />\nwhen there was an abundance of<br />\nquarter-mile material at the University. The same conditions exist this<br />\nseason, and it would not be surprising to see these records go in<br />\nthe spring. Wagner, who holds,<br />\njointly, the mo-yard record, should<br />\nsmash the 220 this year. With<br />\nsome strong competition among the<br />\nouarter-mile men, both the 440 and<br />\n88o marks seem to be doomed likewise. The half-mile record is the<br />\noldest on the boards; the quarter<br />\nmile next in age.<br />\nThere is a gap between 1904 and<br />\n1908. In 1908 the 16-pound hammer record was equalled, but this<br />\nis likely to stand at the University,<br />\ndue to the increasing unpopularity<br />\nof the event in this section.<br />\nIn 1909 Bridgman set a new mark<br />\nof 25Y5s. in the low hurdles. The<br />\nyears 1911 and 1912 have been<br />\nmost productive of records. Lee<br />\nran the mile and two miles at the<br />\nNavy meet in record time, and on<br />\nthe same day Horrax won the pole<br />\nvault with a distance of i I feet 7<br />\ninches.

M.,<br />\non Tuesday the 11th, he will supplement this first lecture by one in<br />\nGerman on the subject of \"Presentday Conflicts for the Worth of Human Life.\" Both of these subjects<br />\ngive free play to the wonderful<br />\nwealth of thoroughly mastered and<br />\nassimilated learning that he has at<br />\nhis command.<br />\nFor those who have not as yet<br />\nmade the acquaintance of Professor Eucken through their study of<br />\nphilosophy, THE NEWS-LETTER Will<br />\ntry briefly to state the chief points<br />\nof his idealistic philosophy.<br />\nEucken is the recognized exponent<br />\nand the principal leader of the<br />\nmovement of thought known as<br />\nvitalistic idealism. We will quote<br />\nfrom our own pages (No. 14):<br />\n\"Very few of those who are properly informed will dispute the assertion that to Eucken, more than<br />\nto any other one man, belongs the<br />\ncredit of having successfully counteracted the poisonous influence of<br />\nthe naturalism of Hegel, the pessimism of Schopenhauer, the positivism of Comte, and the subjective<br />\nemotionalism of Nietzsche, and of<br />\nsubstituting in the place of these<br />\nmisleading philosophicalspeculations<br />\na Christian Weltanshauung.\" The<br />\ndistinctive feature of Eucken's philosophy constitutes an answer to the<br />\nquestion: \"How are we to find the<br />\nright course of conduct, in order<br />\nthat, by following it, we may gain<br />\nthe truth, the reality, the higher<br />\nlife?\" Thomas Seltzer writes that<br />\nEucken teaches that \"there is evil<br />\nin the world that has to be overcome, and, hence life is a fight, a<br />\nconflict, a struggle to overcome the<br />\nevil and develop the good.\" Man<br />\nmust learn to turn away from what<br />\nis merely animal and free himself<br />\nfrom nature and from the material.<br />\nWhen he does this, he begins to live<br />\nthe spiritual life, which \"is the sole<br />\nreality of the world.\" In developing the spiritual life, man also acquires immortality. Eucken, therefore, grants immortality only to<br />\nthose who have freed themselves<br />\nfrom the temporal and attained the<br />\nspiritual life. Religion, therefore,<br />\nquite naturally holds a prominent<br />\nplace in Eucken's philosophy. Chris-<br /><br />\nThe senior class held its annual<br />\nbanquet o n Thursday evening,<br />\nMarch 6, at the Hotel Emerson.<br />\nThe occasion was, without doubt,<br />\na success, as all those present can<br />\nand will testify and, although, possibly not so uproarious as the last<br />\nbanquet was, nevertheless, far more<br />\nenjoyable.<br />\nAfter dinner a vote was taken to<br />\nfind out the opinion of the class<br />\nupon the stars in various lines who<br />\nwere members of the class. Mr.<br />\nGillet was voted the most popular<br />\nand the best athlete; Mr. Donoho,<br />\nthe handsomest; Mr. Getz, as the<br />\nmember who had done most for<br />\nHopkins and the man most likely<br />\nto succeed; Mr. Wolman, the wittiest; Mr. Marshall, the most rustic;<br />\nMr. Sattler, the most optimistic;<br />\nMr. Marston, the greatest ladies'<br />\nman; Mr. Ray, the most dignified;<br />\nMr. Dickinson, the brightest and<br />\nmost eccentric man; Mr. Penniman,<br />\nas the class shark (especially in<br />\nGerman), etc. After the voting had been completed, Mr. Edmund S. Donoho rose<br />\nto introduce the speakers of the<br />\nevening. The first toast was:\"Four<br />\nYears of 1913,\" by C. Leland Getz,<br />\npresident of the class. The following toasts were then given: \"Athletics,\" J. A. \"Dewey\" Penniman;<br />\n\"Our Hullabaloo,\" Julian D. Sears;<br />\n\"Witticisms by Dunlap,\" F. Merrill<br />\nHildebrandt; \"Musical Clubs,\"<br />\nEmory H. Niles;\"Dean vs. Tango;\"<br />\nA. Gus Sattler. After the regular<br />\nspeeches several informal addresses<br />\nwere made, chief of which was a<br />\nmimicking of all the members of<br />\nthe class by Mr. Gillet.<br />\nThe committee in charge of the<br />\nbanquet was composed of the following: George M. Gillet, Jr.,<br />\nchairman; G. Ellis Porter; Julian<br />\nH. Marshall; Louis L. Jacobs; J.<br />\nEdward Richardson, Jr., C. Leland<br />\nGetz.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2.)<br /><br />\n(('ontinued on page 8, col. 3.)<br /><br />\nA crowd of moderate size turned<br />\nout on Friday evening to hear the<br />\nannual interclass debate and public<br />\nspeaking contest; nor was the audience distinguished by any degree<br />\nof enthusiasm. The speaking contest was an excellent one, as has<br />\nbeen the case with the greater number of these contests in the last two<br />\nor three years. The decision was<br />\nawarded by the judges\u2014Prof. D.<br />\nM. Robinson, Prof. W. D. Mustard<br />\nand Mr. Lawrence C. Wroth\u2014to<br />\nClaude I. Uhler for his delivery of<br />\nHenry W. Grady's speech on \"The<br />\nSouthern Negro.\" His voice was<br />\neven and clear and nothing was<br />\noverdone. Practically the same remark holds true for the other contestants\u2014Millard Eiseman, Moses<br />\nBarroway and Charles S. Weech.<br />\nThe last two had unusually powerful<br />\nvoices and, perhaps, relied too much<br />\non these to carry them over places<br />\nwhere a simple, straight-forward<br />\ndeclamation, without any attempt at<br />\ndramatic delivery, would have been<br />\nmore effective. Eiseman was somewhat more successful in this respect.<br />\nAfter the Musical Clubs rendered<br />\na selection, Dr. French, as presiding officer, announced the rules of<br />\nthe debate. The juniors had the<br />\naffirmative of the question: \"Resolved, That without regard to the<br />\nobligations of the Hay-Pauncefote<br />\ntreaty the tolls of the Panama<br />\nCanal should be the same for the<br />\nmerchant vessels of all nations. It<br />\nis understood that the term 'all nations' includes the United States of<br />\nAmerica.\" Hanunond, a s first<br />\nspeaker for the affirmative, sought<br />\nto establish the fundamental propositions on which their debate rested.<br />\nSimpson elaborated these arguments<br />\nand refuted one or two statements<br />\nthe first speaker on the negative<br />\nside, M. H. Waxman, had made.<br />\nGetz brought the prepared speeches<br />\nto a close. The affirmative restricted their speeches to a few telling<br />\npoints which they Grove home at<br />\nevery opportunity; whereas, the<br />\nnegative scattered its fire somewhat,.<br />\nbringing in a variety of questions<br />\nthat had better been left untouched.<br />\nThe rebuttal speeches were well delivered, with the exception of a few<br />\ndiverting instances of mispronunciation.<br />\nAs a whole, the debate was not<br />\nequal to those of recent years. The<br />\nquestion, being a hypothetical one,<br />\nmay have been partially responsible<br />\nfor this. But neither side confined<br />\nitself strictly to the question at issue<br />\nand broached matters of ship sub-<br /><br />\nThe junior banquet will take place<br />\nimmediately after the Easter holidays; the exact date and place will<br />\nbe announced later. The banquet<br />\ncommittee is: Walter Geissel, chairman; Richard Coblentz; Lawrence<br />\nGetz.<br />\n%\u2018<br />\nAt the last meeting of the Engineering Society, which was held on<br />\nMarch 3, the speaker was Professor<br />\nBliss. He gave a splendid lecture<br />\non \"The Advantage of Other Than<br />\nTechnical Subjects in the Education<br />\nof an Engineer.\" The attendance<br />\nwas large. No more meetings of<br />\nthe society will be held until after<br />\nthe Easter holidays.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 5, col. 3.)<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, MARCH 10, 1913.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nClipping from a Baltimore paper:<br />\n\"The other grouch of which the<br />\nAdvice from the writings of Hon.<br />\nTherefore: Patronize those<br />\nEdmund Burke, M.

It has served its<br />\npurpose, namely, to give us a more<br />\ndefinite idea of the number in demand. Each book will cost us<br />\nabout four times the selling price,<br />\nand owing to the small number that<br />\ncan possibly be sold and the heavy<br />\nfixed expenses per volume for better paper, cover, etc., increased production cannot reduce the cost to<br />\nus below the price at which the<br />\nbook is sold. We cannot afford to<br />\nsell many volumes at a sacrifice and<br />\nthus the supply will be strictly limited, not greatly to exceed the actual<br />\nnumber of orders already in. Even<br />\nnow many pages are set up in type<br />\nready for the press.<br />\nNow we come to the arrangement<br />\nof material. First, a large portion<br />\nof the advertising sections are to be<br />\nprinted up. Next in succession the<br />\nindividual histories and write-ups<br />\nmust go to press and then on<br />\nthrough the class histories, athletics,<br />\nto the end. The printer demands at<br />\nleast two months for the issue of<br />\nthe book, six weeks in the printing<br />\noffice and two weeks at the bindery.<br />\nNow as to the biographies, how<br />\nmany additions will be made from<br />\nnow to the end of the year? Very<br />\nfew, I can assure you. And as for<br />\nan inferred rebellion on the part of<br />\nthe members of the class, I can<br />\nbrand that idea of the \"individual\"<br />\nas \"preposterous\" and utter \"nonsense\"\u2014the class understands the<br />\nposition of those in charge thoroughly, I hope, and is supporting us<br />\naccordingly.

Psychotechniques\u2014<br />\na sub-science of psychology\u2014makes<br />\nthe determination. The manner of<br />\nselection seems rather simple:<br />\n\"Twenty motormen of one of our<br />\nlarge cities,\" said the famous student, \"were put to test in our Harvard laboratories, and in several<br />\nminutes we were able to pick out<br />\nthe good motormen, I mean those<br />\nwho had few accidents, and the bad<br />\nones, those who were continually<br />\ncausing trouble for their employers<br />\nby careless operating of \u2022their cars.<br />\n\"The test we put them to would<br />\nperhaps appear childlike, but it succeeded. We had a table with red<br />\nand black cubes on it which epr esented pedestrians a n d vehicles.<br />\nTwo parallel lines represented a<br />\ntrack, and we had a small car that<br />\ncould be moved by turning a little<br />\ncrank. We allowed each motorman<br />\nto run the car. At times we pushed<br />\ncubes representing automobiles or<br />\npersons in front of the car. If the<br />\nimpulse of the motorman was safe<br />\nand his attention careful, he avoided<br />\na collision. A careless operator<br />\nwould hit the blocks, and the very<br />\nmen who had had accidents while<br />\nrunning cars on the streets, and we<br />\nwere able to pick out the reliable<br />\nones.<br />\n\"If the company employing the<br />\nmen had known these facts before<br />\nemploying them, some of the accidents on the line could have been<br />\naverted.\"<br />\nDr. Munsterberg also explained<br />\nhow he had examined thirty girls<br />\nfrom a telephone operating school.<br />\nThey were put to tests of accuracy,<br />\nattention, impulse and imagination.<br />\nAverages were computed, and the<br />\ngirls continued their schooling.<br />\nSome time later, when they had<br />\nfinished the training, those who had<br />\nbeen dismissed as incapable operators were the same as those Dr.<br />\nMunsterberg had found inefficient<br />\nin his tests. Each test required fifty<br />\nminutes. The schooling required a<br />\nyear, and the girls who had attended the school had been paid by the<br />\ncompany. If psychotechniqueg, the<br />\nscience of vocational guidance, had<br />\nbeen employed, contended Dr.<br />\nMunsterberg, the company would<br />\nhave saved the money paid to the<br />\ngirls while learning and the girls<br />\nwould have been able to put the<br />\ntime wasted on some vocation for<br />\nwhich they were fitted.<br />\nFollowing closely the movement<br />\nof scientific management, came that<br />\nof vocational guidance.

When two or more men hold<br />\nthe same record as, for instance, in<br />\nthe ioo-yard dash and the i6-pound<br />\nhammer, the last man to equal the<br />\nrecord is retained. Tootle, '03,<br />\nHunter, '07, and Perce, '07, have<br />\nall done To seconds in the ioo-yard<br />\ndash. Garrett, a graduate student,<br />\nfirst set the record for the hammer<br />\nthrow in 1898. Again, in the mile<br />\nrelay race outdoors, there are two<br />\nholders of the record (3m. 33s.).<br />\nIn 1901 the famous team composed<br />\nof Riggs, Whitman, Hoffman and<br />\nEngland ran the mile in the above<br />\ntime. Last year at the South Atlantic Intercollegiates, held at<br />\nHomewood, Hunter, Stiebel, Uhler<br />\nand Fulton made the identical time<br />\nwhen they finished ahead of Washington and Lee and Georgetown.<br />\nAn indoor mile relay record was established by the 'Varsity team at<br />\nthe Hopkins games in February,<br />\nbeing also the South Atlantic record<br />\n(3m. 3575s.). The team consisted<br />\nof McDonagh, Wells, Lloyd and<br />\nCatlin.<br />\nAs to the individual marks, it appears that record breaking is confined to the past five years, with a<br />\npredominance in 1911 and 1912,<br />\nand to the five years from 1900<br />\nthrough 1904. From these years<br />\nthe broad jump, the high jump, the<br /><br />\nEXCLUSIVE<br />\nIDEAS<br /><br />\nDATE<br /><br />\n19 s<br />\n1912<br />\n22 s<br />\n1903<br />\n514- s.<br />\n1902<br />\n2m<br />\ns<br />\n1900<br />\n4 m. 30* s.....1911<br />\n10 m. 84- s.. ...1911<br />\n15* s.<br />\n1911<br />\n25* s......... 1909<br />\n5 ft. 11+ in....1902<br />\n23 ft. 1 in.. _1904<br />\n11 ft. 7 in.....1911<br />\n43 ft. 2 in.....1912<br />\n117 ft. 3 in. ..1908<br />\n110 ft. 2 in. ..1912<br /><br />\n88o yard records remain untouched. It was a time<br />\nwhen there was an abundance of<br />\nquarter-mile material at the University. The same conditions exist this<br />\nseason, and it would not be surprising to see these records go in<br />\nthe spring. Wagner, who holds,<br />\njointly, the mo-yard record, should<br />\nsmash the 220 this year. With<br />\nsome strong competition among the<br />\nouarter-mile men, both the 440 and<br />\n88o marks seem to be doomed likewise. The half-mile record is the<br />\noldest on the boards; the quarter<br />\nmile next in age.<br />\nThere is a gap between 1904 and<br />\n1908. In 1908 the 16-pound hammer record was equalled, but this<br />\nis likely to stand at the University,<br />\ndue to the increasing unpopularity<br />\nof the event in this section.<br />\nIn 1909 Bridgman set a new mark<br />\nof 25Y5s. in the low hurdles. The<br />\nyears 1911 and 1912 have been<br />\nmost productive of records. Lee<br />\nran the mile and two miles at the<br />\nNavy meet in record time, and on<br />\nthe same day Horrax won the pole<br />\nvault with a distance of i I feet 7<br />\ninches. Later in the season he<br />\nbroke the high hurdles record.<br />\nDignan made two new records last<br />\nyear in the discus and in the shotput.
