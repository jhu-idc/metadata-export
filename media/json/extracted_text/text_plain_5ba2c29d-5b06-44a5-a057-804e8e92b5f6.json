With<br />\nlittle in the way of noticible<br />\nsignals, the quartet manages to<br />\nkeep an uncanny sense of<br />\nphrasing, tempo, and dynamics.<br />\nMelodic lines pass from viola to<br />\nfirst violin with such deftness<br />\nthat one almost assumes that the<br />\nsound came from one<br />\ninstrument.

But<br />\nnumerous problems arise<br />\nconcerning the treatment of<br />\ndissidents in relation to this<br />\nagreement, foremost among them<br />\nis the omission of any sort of<br />\ninterpretive or judicial body<br />\nestablished to ponder the fine<br />\nmeanings of such intangibles as<br />\n'human rights' or 'greater<br />\nfreedom of movement.'<br />\nOverlooking the lack of such a<br />\nbody, questions naturally arise<br />\nconcerning the direction and<br />\nUltimate effectiveness of the<br />\nUnited States' policy towards<br />\ndissent in these Comrrunist<br />\ncountries.<br />\nThe Administration's position,<br />\nas expressed by Secretary of<br />\nState Cyrus Vance, is indefinite<br />\nat best on this subject: \"We will<br />\nnot comment on each and every<br />\nissue, but we will from time to<br />\ntime comment when we see a<br />\nthreat to human rights when we<br />\nbelieve it constructive to do so.\"<br />\nOstensibly, 'comment' is seen as<br />\na constructive means of fighting<br />\nfor human rights in the Soviet<br />\nUnion. What is more likely is that<br />\nthe Soviet leadership views such<br />\ncommentary as an irritant, an<br />\n<br />\nannoyance to be expected from<br />\nthe United States.<br />\nFundamentally, U.S.\u2014Soviet<br />\ndifferences spring from widely<br />\ndivergent conceptions of those<br />\nhighly elusive principles. In the<br />\nUnited States, a citizen has the<br />\nright to express himself freely<br />\nand even to extend this right to<br />\ndirect criticism of the<br />\ngovernment. (Provided, that is,<br />\nthat in doing so, he does not<br />\nthreaten national security.) In<br />\nthe Soviet Union, citizens are<br />\nrequired to forego much of their<br />\nfreedom of expression. They are<br />\nendowed with the right to work<br />\nand to be free of concern about<br />\nemployment and basic survival. I<br />\nwould wager that today many<br />\nAmericans would be willing to<br />\naccept the terms of such an<br />\nexchange. (Though certainly not<br />\nthose of us fortunate enough to<br />\n...\u2022<br />\nbe educating ourselves at<br />\nHopkins.)

The Committee,<br />\ncomposed of faculty, staff and<br />\nstudents, is charged with making<br />\nrecommendations regarding<br />\nParking and traffic regulations<br />\nfor the Homewood campus.<br />\nIn addition to the commuter<br />\nProblem, the Committee has had<br />\nto deal with complaints by<br />\nresidents of Charles Village<br />\n(specifically, residents of the<br />\nHomewood and Bradford<br />\napartment buildings) of excessive<br />\nuse of street spaces by Hopkins<br />\nstudents. The Committee and the<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council believe that<br />\nthese students, as rent-paying<br />\nresidents themselves, are entitled<br />\nto whatever space is available in<br />\nthe community. The off-campus<br />\nHomewood Garage, owned by<br />\nthe University and offering<br />\nlowered rates, was seen as an<br />\nimmediate solution to this<br />\nproblem. It is, however, already<br />\nlosing money.<br />\nThe undergraduate member of<br />\nthe Committee, Paula Canelos,<br />\nworks with a graduate<br />\nrepresentative overseeing the<br />\ninterests of all commuting<br />\nstudents. Canelos described an<br />\nongoing effort, begun three<br />\nweeks ago, to encourage the<br />\nformation of carpools by<br />\ncommuting students. So far, 25<br />\npeople (6 more since spring<br />\n<br />\nregistration), have formed such<br />\narrangements. All parties<br />\ninterested in setting up a carpool<br />\nshould already possess or qualify<br />\nfor JHU parking permits. The<br />\nOffice of Plant Planning and<br />\nOperations in Room 114,<br />\nGarland Hall, is still accepting<br />\ncarpool applications which were<br />\ndistributed at registration.<br />\nThe application require a<br />\nlisting of at least three<br />\nnarticipants.

(We can huff and we<br />\ncan puff, but we're just not going<br />\nto be able to blow their house<br />\ndown.) The line of action that<br />\nhes, seem to hold some promise<br />\nis Dr. Kissinger's recently<br />\nrejected 'linkage' policy, which<br />\nlinks matters of policy to trade.<br />\nThis tactic, however, has often<br />\ncaused even more heated<br />\nrelations between our two<br />\ncountries. It is true that the<br />\nSoviet leadership understands the<br />\nlanguage of technological trade,<br />\nfor it is in this field that the<br />\nSoviet most certainly needs<br />\nassistance. But if the<br />\nmanufacturers of advanced<br />\ncomputer and electronic<br />\nequipment continue to meet the<br />\nSoviet demand (with the tacit<br />\napproval of the current<br />\nAdministration), we can never<br />\nexpect to make gains in our<br />\n'commitment to assuring human<br />\nrights.' Unfortunately, the<br />\ncessation of trade in<br />\ntechnological goods is not likely<br />\nto be adopted by the new<br />\nadministration. Although .the<br />\nideological war wages, the<br />\nprofitable stream of commerce<br />\nmust continue. Our<br />\n'commitment' to the human<br />\nrights of certain segments of the<br />\nworld's populations is not fooling<br />\nanyone, They are getting what<br />\nthey want (the advanced<br />\ntechnology) and we are getting<br />\nwhat we want (the $).

The most extreme<br />\nalternative, building a multi-level<br />\ngarage on campus, is neither<br />\nserious nor even feasible, since<br />\nparking fees would have to be<br />\ninstituted to pay for its<br />\nconstruction.

From noon until 2 p.m.<br />\nevery day before the fight, the<br />\nPublic could watch Sugar Ray<br />\nWork out and possibly meet him.<br />\nI have never been within sight of<br />\nan actual boxing ring, let alone a<br />\nboxer, so after a little prompting<br />\nI decided to go downtown and<br />\ncheck out this new wonderboy.<br />\nI arrived at the Civic Center<br />\nand after winding through its<br />\ngrimy bowels, came to the<br />\ngarage, which had been converted<br />\ninto a training area. The City had<br />\napparently gone to great lengths<br />\nto make this extra attraction<br />\nappealing. There were rows of<br />\nfolding chairs for the spectators<br />\non three sides of the ring and a<br />\nhot dog stand. About two<br />\nhundred people were already<br />\nthere; women, children,<br />\n.executives, bums, and novices<br />\nlike myself.<br />\nSugar Ray and his sparring<br />\nPartner, his cousin Odell<br />\nLeonard, were in the ring<br />\nreceiving last minute instructions<br />\nfrom a trainer. Both Leonards<br />\nwere attired in personalized<br />\norange Civic Center T-shirts.<br />\nSugar Ray and Odell had their<br />\nfaces greased under the<br />\nProtective helmets, so that<br />\nmisplaced punches could do little<br />\n<br />\nor no harm. Their training gloves<br />\nweighed 16 ounces apiece, a<br />\nhalf-pound heavier than the<br />\ngloves Sugar Ray would use<br />\nagainst Luis \"The Bull\" Vega.<br />\nThe training gloves are heavier,<br />\nyet protective, like big pillows on<br />\nthe fighters' hands. Sugar Ray<br />\nand Odell would spar for five<br />\n3-minute rounds.

The crowd applauded<br />\nAs a sparring partner, Odell was loudly after every round and to<br />\nnot supposed to actually fight his my surprise, shouted more<br />\ncousin, or harm him. Instead, his encouragement to Odell than to<br />\njob was to refine Sugar Ray's Sugar. Ray. It was evident that<br />\nstrong points, and strengthen his they wanted to see some action<br />\nweaknesses. The trainer was during the rounds. Expressions<br />\nmuttering instructions to Odell such as \"shake 'im up\", \"make<br />\nand encouragement to Sugar Ray 'im sweat\", and \"put 'er in<br />\nthroughout each round. Even in automatic, Odell\", were flying<br />\n<br />\nthrough the air. A few hecklers<br />\nwere present, but in general the<br />\ncrowd was jovial and any<br />\nheckling was ignored.<br />\nAfter the sparring was over,<br />\nSugar Ray took time to sign<br />\nautographs and shake hands. He<br />\nwas sincere in meeting and<br />\ntalking to his admirers, which<br />\nundoubtedly accounts for his<br />\ngreat popularity. It was with<br />\nsome difficulty that he made his<br />\nway to the heavy punching bag:<br />\npeople especially youngsters.<br />\nwere crowding around him. Sugar<br />\nRay showed the same dynamic<br />\nstyle on the bag as he did in the<br />\nring. Most of the crowd<br />\nremained, and gathered around<br />\nto watch. He attacked the bag for<br />\nabout fifteen minutes and believe<br />\nme, he's no slouch. It was<br />\nextremely difficult not to be<br />\nimpressed by his strength. While<br />\nSugar Ray was punching his heart<br />\nout,Odell was skipping rope.<br />\nThat may sound easy to some of<br />\nyou, but it actually takes months<br />\nto learn to do it correctly,<br />\ninvolving precise timing and lots<br />\nof endurance. The only way<br />\nFloyd Patterson could learn to<br />\ndo it was by jumping off the<br />\nboxing ring and bring the rope<br />\nover his head and under his feet<br />\nbefore he hit the floor. Sugar<br />\nRay finished punching the bag<br />\nand after another session of<br />\npublic relations, began skipping<br />\nrope. With this the training<br />\nsession was ended.<br />\nThe City of Baltimore is to be<br />\ncongratulated for its efforts in<br />\npromoting Sugar Ray's fight. The<br />\ntraining session was well<br />\norganized; children and adults<br />\nwere not discouraged from<br />\nclimbing into the ring. Sugar Ray<br />\nwas a perfect gentleman and the<br />\ntrainers also took time to discuss<br />\nboxing with interested<br />\nspectators. Due to Baltimore's<br />\nsupport of Sugar Ray, I think his<br />\ncareer has been given a major<br />\nboost. From the appeal of a<br />\nfreebie, more potential admierers<br />\nand supporters were exposed to<br />\nSugar Ray than would have been<br />\npossible.<br />\nSince I watched Sugar Ray<br />\ntrain, he has had a very successful<br />\nbout (unanimous decision) with<br />\nVega. The crowd was estimated<br />\nat over 9,000 people, outdoing<br />\n<br />\nMuhammad Ali, who attracted<br />\n6,100 people to a Civic Center<br />\nexhibition fight in 1972. Sugar<br />\nRay was very appreciative about<br />\nthe attention he's received from<br />\nthe City and in an interview on<br />\nFeb. 7 said, \"Baltimore is the<br />\nhome of Sugar Ray Leonard.\"<br />\nManager Angelo Dundee alsc<br />\nmust have been suitably<br />\nimpressed, for he claims to have<br />\nSugar Ray back for a fight in<br />\nBaltimore on April 2.<br />\nDoes this interest in Sugar Ray<br />\nLeonard indicate a change in the<br />\nsport of boxing? In the past few<br />\nyears, boxing has declined in<br />\npopularity, despite the attempts<br />\nof Ali and others to keep it in the<br />\nnews. One of the reasons for the<br />\nrekindling of boxing may have<br />\nbeen the 1976 Olympics, where<br />\nthe United States team won<br />\nabout half the gold medals in<br />\nboxing. Sugar Ray was one of the<br />\ngold medalists and a favorite of<br />\nHoward Cosell. The sportscasters<br />\nagreed that of all the boxers at<br />\nMontreal, Sugar Ray had the best<br />\nchance to make it as a<br />\nprofessional. After he won the<br />\ngold medal, however, Sugar Ray<br />\nclaimed he would not fight<br />\nprofessionally. Some thought he<br />\nmade this statement because of a<br />\nproblem with swelling hands.<br />\nSugar Ray was questioned about<br />\nthis in an interview before his<br />\nCivic Center fight and said that<br />\niiis hands were in great shape. So<br />\nit seems that, regardless of his<br />\nstatement at Montreal, Sugar Ray<br />\nis on his way to becoming a<br />\nsuccessful pro boxer. It is a<br />\nwell-known fact, however, that in<br />\nthe boxing profession, the<br />\nheavyweights gather all the glory<br />\nand publicity. This near-axiom<br />\nmight make Sugar Ray's path to<br />\ngreater reknown a little<br />\nmcertain. His career is being<br />\nwatched nationally, possibly<br />\nbecause aficionados feel he's the<br />\none who can break the<br />\nheavyweight stranglehold on<br />\nboxing.<br />\nApril 2<br />\nFor those of you who missed<br />\nSugar Ray, try to see him when<br />\nhe returns April 2. Besides being<br />\na native of Maryland, he's a fine<br />\nyoung athlete.

The Jays<br />\ncontrolled the opening tip, but<br />\nfailed to connect when Dan<br />\nKopcza's short turnaround jump<br />\nshot was blocked by 6'6\"<br />\nforward Mark Tucker of Widener.<br />\nThe Pioneers turned the<br />\ndefensive gem into an offensive<br />\nsurge capped off with a driving<br />\nlayup from guard Mark Donahue,<br />\nwho led the balanced scoring<br />\nattack for Widener with 19<br />\npoints. Finston quickly tied the<br />\ngame at 2 by pumping in a 25<br />\nfoot jump shot from the top of<br />\nthe foul circle.<br />\nMoments later, the Jays took<br />\nthe lead when Andy Scheinfeld<br />\nhit a beautiful turn around jump<br />\nshot. After the score was tied,<br />\nScheinfeld again put the Jays up<br />\nby driving past two Widener<br />\ndefenders and scopping the ball<br />\nin. But two Widener buckets<br />\ndropped in by Donahue put the<br />\nPioneers in the lead to stay 8-6.<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays hung close to the<br />\nPioneers with two jump shots<br />\nfrom Randy Lovallo and two<br />\nfoul shots sunk by Dean Uhler.<br />\nWidener then went on a scoring<br />\nbinge, outscoring the Jays 8-2 in<br />\nthe next three minutes. The Jays<br />\nwent dry in the remaining 9<br />\nminutes of the first half,<br />\nmustering only two field goals<br />\nfrom Finston and Lovallo.<br />\nCostly turnovers and failure to<br />\ngain the offensive rebound<br />\nspelled the difference for the<br />\nJays as they ended the first half<br />\ntrailing 29-18. The Blue Jays shot<br />\na poor 8-21 or 38% from the<br />\nfloor while the Pioneers hit 13 of<br />\n31 or 47% of their shots. In<br />\naddition, the Jays were unable to<br />\npull down one offensive rebound<br />\nin the first half.<br />\nThe second half offered no<br />\nconsolation to the visiting team<br />\nas the Pioneers ran the score to<br />\n34-18 before the Jays could<br />\nanswer with a bucket from<br />\nFinston. The Widener team took<br />\nthe opening tip and converted an<br />\neasy layup. Seconds later,<br />\npioneer senior Jim Fitzpatrick<br />\ntook a pinpoint pass from 6'6\"<br />\nsenior Dennis James and drove to<br />\nthe hoop dropping in the shot. In<br />\nthe process he was fouled,<br />\nallowing him to complete a three<br />\npoint play.<br />\nAn interesting call by the<br />\nreferee prevented Widener from<br />\ntaking an eighteen point lead.<br />\nDonahue led a Pioneer three on<br />\n<br />\none drive to the bucket and the<br />\nWidener guard eventually shot a<br />\nrunning layup. The ball bounced<br />\naround the rim for a while before<br />\nthe Pioneer center (James)leaped<br />\nup and grabbed the ball, slammed<br />\nit into the hoop, and hung on the<br />\nrim. Hanging on the rim<br />\nconstitutes a technical foul in<br />\nNCAA play. The referee also<br />\ncalled offensive goal tending,<br />\nexplaining that the ball was<br />\nabove the imaginery plane of the<br />\nbasket when James took hold of<br />\nit. Unfortunately for the Jays,<br />\ntechnical free throw shooter<br />\nKevin Kabat missed the shot.<br />\nThe Pioneers continued to<br />\npump the ball through the net,<br />\nbut Finston seemed to answer<br />\nwith his baseline jump shots<br />\nevery time. At 12:43 of the<br />\nsecond half, guard Lovallo<br />\nsprained his ankle in the process<br />\nof attempting to block a shot.<br />\nThe valuable 6'1\" playmaker<br />\ntook a flying leap at a Widener<br />\noffensive player and came up<br />\nlimping. He was quickly replaced<br />\nwith Duey Levine by Coach<br />\nRupert.<br />\n\"Randy is definitely going to<br />\nmiss Monday and Wednesday<br />\nnights' games,\" commented<br />\nCoach Rupert. \"Luckily the<br />\nx-rays taken came out negative.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays now stand at<br />\n5-3 in their league, tied with<br />\nWashington College.

CONSIDINE<br />\nThe Quartetto Italiano, one of<br />\nEurope's finest chamber<br />\nensembles, appeared at Shriver<br />\nHall Saturday in a concert which<br />\namply illustrated both their<br />\ntechnical facility as well as their<br />\nstylistic predilictions.<br />\nHaving played together for<br />\nmore than thirty years, the<br />\namount of rapport the Quartetto<br />\nItaliano has developed is<br />\nunderstandably remarkable. With<br />\nlittle in the way of noticible<br />\nsignals, the quartet manages to<br />\nkeep an uncanny sense of<br />\nphrasing, tempo, and dynamics.<br />\nMelodic lines pass from viola to<br />\nfirst violin with such deftness<br />\nthat one almost assumes that the<br />\nsound came from one<br />\ninstrument. Ensemble blending is<br />\nso precise that it becomes<br />\ndifficult to place the voices in a<br />\nchord with the instruments<br />\nproducing the sound.<br />\nHowever admirable this may<br />\nbe technically, one might be<br />\ntempted to question the validity<br />\nof such a sound when applied to<br />\nthe works of all composers.<br />\nSurely, just as two different<br />\ncomposers will employ different<br />\nstyle's, the tone employed by an<br />\nensemble playing those works<br />\nshould register that difference.<br />\nRegrettably in Saturday's<br />\nconcert, this was not always the<br />\ncase.<br /><br />\nThe concert opened with a<br />\nthe classical dimensions of the<br />\nreading of Beethoven's Quartet<br />\npiece.

But<br />\nnumerous problems arise<br />\nconcerning the treatment of<br />\ndissidents in relation to this<br />\nagreement, foremost among them<br />\nis the omission of any sort of<br />\ninterpretive or judicial body<br />\nestablished to ponder the fine<br />\nmeanings of such intangibles as<br />\n'human rights' or 'greater<br />\nfreedom of movement.'<br />\nOverlooking the lack of such a<br />\nbody, questions naturally arise<br />\nconcerning the direction and<br />\nUltimate effectiveness of the<br />\nUnited States' policy towards<br />\ndissent in these Comrrunist<br />\ncountries.<br />\nThe Administration's position,<br />\nas expressed by Secretary of<br />\nState Cyrus Vance, is indefinite<br />\nat best on this subject: \"We will<br />\nnot comment on each and every<br />\nissue, but we will from time to<br />\ntime comment when we see a<br />\nthreat to human rights when we<br />\nbelieve it constructive to do so.\"<br />\nOstensibly, 'comment' is seen as<br />\na constructive means of fighting<br />\nfor human rights in the Soviet<br />\nUnion. What is more likely is that<br />\nthe Soviet leadership views such<br />\ncommentary as an irritant, an<br /><br />\nannoyance to be expected from<br />\nthe United States.<br />\nFundamentally, U.S.\u2014Soviet<br />\ndifferences spring from widely<br />\ndivergent conceptions of those<br />\nhighly elusive principles. In the<br />\nUnited States, a citizen has the<br />\nright to express himself freely<br />\nand even to extend this right to<br />\ndirect criticism of the<br />\ngovernment. (Provided, that is,<br />\nthat in doing so, he does not<br />\nthreaten national security.) In<br />\nthe Soviet Union, citizens are<br />\nrequired to forego much of their<br />\nfreedom of expression. They are<br />\nendowed with the right to work<br />\nand to be free of concern about<br />\nemployment and basic survival. I<br />\nwould wager that today many<br />\nAmericans would be willing to<br />\naccept the terms of such an<br />\nexchange. (Though certainly not<br />\nthose of us fortunate enough to<br />\n...\u2022<br />\nbe educating ourselves at<br />\nHopkins.)

The Committee,<br />\ncomposed of faculty, staff and<br />\nstudents, is charged with making<br />\nrecommendations regarding<br />\nParking and traffic regulations<br />\nfor the Homewood campus.<br />\nIn addition to the commuter<br />\nProblem, the Committee has had<br />\nto deal with complaints by<br />\nresidents of Charles Village<br />\n(specifically, residents of the<br />\nHomewood and Bradford<br />\napartment buildings) of excessive<br />\nuse of street spaces by Hopkins<br />\nstudents. The Committee and the<br /><br />\nStudent Council believe that<br />\nthese students, as rent-paying<br />\nresidents themselves, are entitled<br />\nto whatever space is available in<br />\nthe community. The off-campus<br />\nHomewood Garage, owned by<br />\nthe University and offering<br />\nlowered rates, was seen as an<br />\nimmediate solution to this<br />\nproblem. It is, however, already<br />\nlosing money.<br />\nThe undergraduate member of<br />\nthe Committee, Paula Canelos,<br />\nworks with a graduate<br />\nrepresentative overseeing the<br />\ninterests of all commuting<br />\nstudents. Canelos described an<br />\nongoing effort, begun three<br />\nweeks ago, to encourage the<br />\nformation of carpools by<br />\ncommuting students. So far, 25<br />\npeople (6 more since spring<br /><br />\nregistration), have formed such<br />\narrangements. All parties<br />\ninterested in setting up a carpool<br />\nshould already possess or qualify<br />\nfor JHU parking permits. The<br />\nOffice of Plant Planning and<br />\nOperations in Room 114,<br />\nGarland Hall, is still accepting<br />\ncarpool applications which were<br />\ndistributed at registration.<br />\nThe application require a<br />\nlisting of at least three<br />\nnarticipants. Canelos stressed the<br />\nfact that carpoolers have received<br />\npreferential parking spaces. Thus<br />\nfar, some metered spaces east of<br />\nGarland Hall have been assigned.<br />\nIn the future, spaces behind<br />\nShriver Hall will be assigned to<br />\ncommuters who choose to pool.<br />\nA special permit is given to each<br />\ngroup that participates in the<br /><br />\nprogram and is transferable to<br />\neach of the cars designated for<br />\ncarpool use in the application.<br />\n\"One out of every three<br />\nvehicles are compact cars\"<br />\nCanelos said another measure<br />\ninstituted by the committee, for<br />\ncommuters unable to take part in<br />\nthe car pool plan, is a<br />\nreorganization of parking spaces.<br />\nShe estimated one out of three<br />\nvehicles used by faculty and<br />\nstudents (Type I and II JHU<br />\nparking permits) are compact<br />\ncars, as defined by the Office of<br />\nPlant Operations guidelines.<br />\nAmerican compacts such as<br />\nJavelins, Pintos, Vegas, or Jeeps<br />\nand all foreign models except<br />\nCitroen, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz,<br /><br />\nComment' is not going to bring a<br />\nhalt to repression any more than<br />\nname-calling succeeds in<br />\ndiscouraging undesirable<br />\nbehavior. (We can huff and we<br />\ncan puff, but we're just not going<br />\nto be able to blow their house<br />\ndown.) The line of action that<br />\nhes, seem to hold some promise<br />\nis Dr. Kissinger's recently<br />\nrejected 'linkage' policy, which<br />\nlinks matters of policy to trade.<br />\nThis tactic, however, has often<br />\ncaused even more heated<br />\nrelations between our two<br />\ncountries. It is true that the<br />\nSoviet leadership understands the<br />\nlanguage of technological trade,<br />\nfor it is in this field that the<br />\nSoviet most certainly needs<br />\nassistance. But if the<br />\nmanufacturers of advanced<br />\ncomputer and electronic<br />\nequipment continue to meet the<br />\nSoviet demand (with the tacit<br />\napproval of the current<br />\nAdministration), we can never<br />\nexpect to make gains in our<br />\n'commitment to assuring human<br />\nrights.' Unfortunately, the<br />\ncessation of trade in<br />\ntechnological goods is not likely<br />\nto be adopted by the new<br />\nadministration. Although .the<br />\nideological war wages, the<br />\nprofitable stream of commerce<br />\nmust continue. Our<br />\n'commitment' to the human<br />\nrights of certain segments of the<br />\nworld's populations is not fooling<br />\nanyone, They are getting what<br />\nthey want (the advanced<br />\ntechnology) and we are getting<br />\nwhat we want (the $). Too bad<br />\nthat the dissidents are the only<br />\nones that lose<br /><br />\nVolkswagen buses and Volvo,<br />\nmodel 1800 qualify. Sometime<br />\nthis week or next, the lot directly<br />\nsouth of Garland Hall will be<br />\nrestriped for compact cars. This<br />\nchange should increase lot<br />\ncapacity by 14 per cent, she said.<br />\nA number of other solutions<br />\nto the commuter parking crunch<br />\nhave been proposed by the<br />\nCommittee. The most extreme<br />\nalternative, building a multi-level<br />\ngarage on campus, is neither<br />\nserious nor even feasible, since<br />\nparking fees would have to be<br />\ninstituted to pay for its<br />\nconstruction. A suitable location<br />\nfor such a garage would also have<br />\nto be found. However, Canelos<br />\nsaid a survey would be taken in<br />\nthe near future for a reaction to<br />\nthis idea.<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nwe're all brothers<br /><br />\nNEWS-IETTER<br /><br />\nvol. lxxxi, no. 32/tuesday, february 15, 1977/baltimore<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\nmanaging editor<br />\nnews editor<br />\nsports editor<br />\ngraphics editor<br />\nphoto-production manager.<br /><br />\nMike Deak,Mike Krug<br />\nVanessa Evan,Carole Jaffe<br />\nDavid Hawk<br />\nGeorge Zelinsky<br />\nDavid Kraus<br />\nScott Marks<br />\nJennifer Bishop<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins News-Letter is published twice weekly, Tuesday and<br />\nFriday, during the academic year.

Sugar<br />\nRay Leonard, Olympic gold<br />\nmedalist in middleweight boxing,<br />\nwas making an appearance in<br />\nCharm City to fight on Feb. 5.<br />\nThe City of Baltimore, as<br />\npromoter, attempted to attract<br />\npeople to the main event by<br />\nmaking Sugar Ray's training<br />\nsessions free and open to the<br />\nPublic. From noon until 2 p.m.<br />\nevery day before the fight, the<br />\nPublic could watch Sugar Ray<br />\nWork out and possibly meet him.<br />\nI have never been within sight of<br />\nan actual boxing ring, let alone a<br />\nboxer, so after a little prompting<br />\nI decided to go downtown and<br />\ncheck out this new wonderboy.<br />\nI arrived at the Civic Center<br />\nand after winding through its<br />\ngrimy bowels, came to the<br />\ngarage, which had been converted<br />\ninto a training area. The City had<br />\napparently gone to great lengths<br />\nto make this extra attraction<br />\nappealing. There were rows of<br />\nfolding chairs for the spectators<br />\non three sides of the ring and a<br />\nhot dog stand. About two<br />\nhundred people were already<br />\nthere; women, children,<br />\n.executives, bums, and novices<br />\nlike myself.<br />\nSugar Ray and his sparring<br />\nPartner, his cousin Odell<br />\nLeonard, were in the ring<br />\nreceiving last minute instructions<br />\nfrom a trainer. Both Leonards<br />\nwere attired in personalized<br />\norange Civic Center T-shirts.<br />\nSugar Ray and Odell had their<br />\nfaces greased under the<br />\nProtective helmets, so that<br />\nmisplaced punches could do little<br /><br />\nor no harm. Their training gloves<br />\nweighed 16 ounces apiece, a<br />\nhalf-pound heavier than the<br />\ngloves Sugar Ray would use<br />\nagainst Luis \"The Bull\" Vega.<br />\nThe training gloves are heavier,<br />\nyet protective, like big pillows on<br />\nthe fighters' hands. Sugar Ray<br />\nand Odell would spar for five<br />\n3-minute rounds. An announcer<br />\nwas also present, who advised tbe<br />\nspectators between rounds to<br />\nbuy their tickets, which cost up<br />\nto twenty bucks a seat.<br />\nI don't think I ever realized it<br />\nbefore, but a fighter's personality<br />\ncomes through when he fights.<br />\nOdell Leonard, built like a small<br />\nGeorge Foreman, was a clown in<br />\nthe ring.

The crowd applauded<br />\nAs a sparring partner, Odell was loudly after every round and to<br />\nnot supposed to actually fight his my surprise, shouted more<br />\ncousin, or harm him. Instead, his encouragement to Odell than to<br />\njob was to refine Sugar Ray's Sugar. Ray. It was evident that<br />\nstrong points, and strengthen his they wanted to see some action<br />\nweaknesses. The trainer was during the rounds. Expressions<br />\nmuttering instructions to Odell such as \"shake 'im up\", \"make<br />\nand encouragement to Sugar Ray 'im sweat\", and \"put 'er in<br />\nthroughout each round. Even in automatic, Odell\", were flying<br /><br />\nthrough the air. A few hecklers<br />\nwere present, but in general the<br />\ncrowd was jovial and any<br />\nheckling was ignored.<br />\nAfter the sparring was over,<br />\nSugar Ray took time to sign<br />\nautographs and shake hands. He<br />\nwas sincere in meeting and<br />\ntalking to his admirers, which<br />\nundoubtedly accounts for his<br />\ngreat popularity. It was with<br />\nsome difficulty that he made his<br />\nway to the heavy punching bag:<br />\npeople especially youngsters.<br />\nwere crowding around him. Sugar<br />\nRay showed the same dynamic<br />\nstyle on the bag as he did in the<br />\nring. Most of the crowd<br />\nremained, and gathered around<br />\nto watch. He attacked the bag for<br />\nabout fifteen minutes and believe<br />\nme, he's no slouch. It was<br />\nextremely difficult not to be<br />\nimpressed by his strength. While<br />\nSugar Ray was punching his heart<br />\nout,Odell was skipping rope.<br />\nThat may sound easy to some of<br />\nyou, but it actually takes months<br />\nto learn to do it correctly,<br />\ninvolving precise timing and lots<br />\nof endurance. The only way<br />\nFloyd Patterson could learn to<br />\ndo it was by jumping off the<br />\nboxing ring and bring the rope<br />\nover his head and under his feet<br />\nbefore he hit the floor. Sugar<br />\nRay finished punching the bag<br />\nand after another session of<br />\npublic relations, began skipping<br />\nrope. With this the training<br />\nsession was ended.<br />\nThe City of Baltimore is to be<br />\ncongratulated for its efforts in<br />\npromoting Sugar Ray's fight. The<br />\ntraining session was well<br />\norganized; children and adults<br />\nwere not discouraged from<br />\nclimbing into the ring. Sugar Ray<br />\nwas a perfect gentleman and the<br />\ntrainers also took time to discuss<br />\nboxing with interested<br />\nspectators. Due to Baltimore's<br />\nsupport of Sugar Ray, I think his<br />\ncareer has been given a major<br />\nboost. From the appeal of a<br />\nfreebie, more potential admierers<br />\nand supporters were exposed to<br />\nSugar Ray than would have been<br />\npossible.<br />\nSince I watched Sugar Ray<br />\ntrain, he has had a very successful<br />\nbout (unanimous decision) with<br />\nVega. The crowd was estimated<br />\nat over 9,000 people, outdoing<br /><br />\nMuhammad Ali, who attracted<br />\n6,100 people to a Civic Center<br />\nexhibition fight in 1972. Sugar<br />\nRay was very appreciative about<br />\nthe attention he's received from<br />\nthe City and in an interview on<br />\nFeb. 7 said, \"Baltimore is the<br />\nhome of Sugar Ray Leonard.\"<br />\nManager Angelo Dundee alsc<br />\nmust have been suitably<br />\nimpressed, for he claims to have<br />\nSugar Ray back for a fight in<br />\nBaltimore on April 2.<br />\nDoes this interest in Sugar Ray<br />\nLeonard indicate a change in the<br />\nsport of boxing? In the past few<br />\nyears, boxing has declined in<br />\npopularity, despite the attempts<br />\nof Ali and others to keep it in the<br />\nnews. One of the reasons for the<br />\nrekindling of boxing may have<br />\nbeen the 1976 Olympics, where<br />\nthe United States team won<br />\nabout half the gold medals in<br />\nboxing. Sugar Ray was one of the<br />\ngold medalists and a favorite of<br />\nHoward Cosell. The sportscasters<br />\nagreed that of all the boxers at<br />\nMontreal, Sugar Ray had the best<br />\nchance to make it as a<br />\nprofessional. After he won the<br />\ngold medal, however, Sugar Ray<br />\nclaimed he would not fight<br />\nprofessionally. Some thought he<br />\nmade this statement because of a<br />\nproblem with swelling hands.<br />\nSugar Ray was questioned about<br />\nthis in an interview before his<br />\nCivic Center fight and said that<br />\niiis hands were in great shape. So<br />\nit seems that, regardless of his<br />\nstatement at Montreal, Sugar Ray<br />\nis on his way to becoming a<br />\nsuccessful pro boxer. It is a<br />\nwell-known fact, however, that in<br />\nthe boxing profession, the<br />\nheavyweights gather all the glory<br />\nand publicity. This near-axiom<br />\nmight make Sugar Ray's path to<br />\ngreater reknown a little<br />\nmcertain. His career is being<br />\nwatched nationally, possibly<br />\nbecause aficionados feel he's the<br />\none who can break the<br />\nheavyweight stranglehold on<br />\nboxing.<br />\nApril 2<br />\nFor those of you who missed<br />\nSugar Ray, try to see him when<br />\nhe returns April 2.

The Jays<br />\ncontrolled the opening tip, but<br />\nfailed to connect when Dan<br />\nKopcza's short turnaround jump<br />\nshot was blocked by 6'6\"<br />\nforward Mark Tucker of Widener.<br />\nThe Pioneers turned the<br />\ndefensive gem into an offensive<br />\nsurge capped off with a driving<br />\nlayup from guard Mark Donahue,<br />\nwho led the balanced scoring<br />\nattack for Widener with 19<br />\npoints. Finston quickly tied the<br />\ngame at 2 by pumping in a 25<br />\nfoot jump shot from the top of<br />\nthe foul circle.<br />\nMoments later, the Jays took<br />\nthe lead when Andy Scheinfeld<br />\nhit a beautiful turn around jump<br />\nshot. After the score was tied,<br />\nScheinfeld again put the Jays up<br />\nby driving past two Widener<br />\ndefenders and scopping the ball<br />\nin. But two Widener buckets<br />\ndropped in by Donahue put the<br />\nPioneers in the lead to stay 8-6.<br /><br />\nThe Jays hung close to the<br />\nPioneers with two jump shots<br />\nfrom Randy Lovallo and two<br />\nfoul shots sunk by Dean Uhler.<br />\nWidener then went on a scoring<br />\nbinge, outscoring the Jays 8-2 in<br />\nthe next three minutes. The Jays<br />\nwent dry in the remaining 9<br />\nminutes of the first half,<br />\nmustering only two field goals<br />\nfrom Finston and Lovallo.<br />\nCostly turnovers and failure to<br />\ngain the offensive rebound<br />\nspelled the difference for the<br />\nJays as they ended the first half<br />\ntrailing 29-18. The Blue Jays shot<br />\na poor 8-21 or 38% from the<br />\nfloor while the Pioneers hit 13 of<br />\n31 or 47% of their shots. In<br />\naddition, the Jays were unable to<br />\npull down one offensive rebound<br />\nin the first half.<br />\nThe second half offered no<br />\nconsolation to the visiting team<br />\nas the Pioneers ran the score to<br />\n34-18 before the Jays could<br />\nanswer with a bucket from<br />\nFinston. The Widener team took<br />\nthe opening tip and converted an<br />\neasy layup. Seconds later,<br />\npioneer senior Jim Fitzpatrick<br />\ntook a pinpoint pass from 6'6\"<br />\nsenior Dennis James and drove to<br />\nthe hoop dropping in the shot. In<br />\nthe process he was fouled,<br />\nallowing him to complete a three<br />\npoint play.<br />\nAn interesting call by the<br />\nreferee prevented Widener from<br />\ntaking an eighteen point lead.<br />\nDonahue led a Pioneer three on<br /><br />\none drive to the bucket and the<br />\nWidener guard eventually shot a<br />\nrunning layup. The ball bounced<br />\naround the rim for a while before<br />\nthe Pioneer center (James)leaped<br />\nup and grabbed the ball, slammed<br />\nit into the hoop, and hung on the<br />\nrim. Hanging on the rim<br />\nconstitutes a technical foul in<br />\nNCAA play. The referee also<br />\ncalled offensive goal tending,<br />\nexplaining that the ball was<br />\nabove the imaginery plane of the<br />\nbasket when James took hold of<br />\nit. Unfortunately for the Jays,<br />\ntechnical free throw shooter<br />\nKevin Kabat missed the shot.<br />\nThe Pioneers continued to<br />\npump the ball through the net,<br />\nbut Finston seemed to answer<br />\nwith his baseline jump shots<br />\nevery time. At 12:43 of the<br />\nsecond half, guard Lovallo<br />\nsprained his ankle in the process<br />\nof attempting to block a shot.<br />\nThe valuable 6'1\" playmaker<br />\ntook a flying leap at a Widener<br />\noffensive player and came up<br />\nlimping. He was quickly replaced<br />\nwith Duey Levine by Coach<br />\nRupert.<br />\n\"Randy is definitely going to<br />\nmiss Monday and Wednesday<br />\nnights' games,\" commented<br />\nCoach Rupert. \"Luckily the<br />\nx-rays taken came out negative.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays now stand at<br />\n5-3 in their league, tied with<br />\nWashington College.

By<br />\nthat time, JHU had built up a<br />\ncommanding 20-5 lead that was<br />\nnever seriously threatened.<br />\nThis advantage had been<br />\ncreated through successive<br />\nvictories in the 400-yard medley<br />\nrelay, the 1000-yard freestyle<br />\nand the 200-yard freestyle.<br />\nFollowing an American win in<br />\nthe 50-yard freestyle, the Jays<br />\ngrabbed both first and second in<br />\nthe 200-yard individual medley<br />\nand the 1-meter diving to take a<br />\n40-11 lead.<br />\nThe visitors to.

Both<br />\nline talent,\" the JHU mentor<br />\nnoted,\" and we felt that, if they<br />\nhad been prepared, they could<br />\nhave beaten us.\"<br />\nThe victory over Allegheny<br />\nwas one of the season's biggest<br />\nwins. Not only is Allegheny a<br />\nserious contender for the<br />\nDivision III championship that<br />\nhas just eluded the grasp of JHU<br />\nthe past two years, but the<br />\nPennsylvanians had also beaten<br />\ndefending champion St.<br />\nLawrence earlier this year and<br />\nthis meet could let the Jays see<br />\nhow they rate against their main<br />\nopposition.<br />\nRepeating their method of the<br />\nprevious week, Hopkins built up<br />\na huge lead through the first<br />\nthree events and never looked<br />\nback. Following a Hopkins win in<br />\nthe opening relay, JHU freshman<br />\nsensation Tim Collins continued<br />\nhis excellence in the distance<br />\nfreestyle events by taking first<br />\nplace in the 1650-yard freestyle<br />\nste[fan burns<br />\nand setting a pool record in the<br />\nprocess.
