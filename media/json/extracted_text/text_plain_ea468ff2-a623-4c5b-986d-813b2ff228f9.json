MAGOFFIN DEFENDS<br />\nCLASSICS<br />\n\"Latin and Greek Are the Foundation<br />\nof Our Education,\" Former Hopkins Professor Tells N. Y. U. Class<br />\n<br />\n\"The student who has had a<br />\nclassical education is superior to<br />\nthe student who lacks this advantage,\" Prof. Ralph Van Deman<br />\nMagoffin, head of the Department<br />\nof Classics at New York University, told the Heights Freshmen at<br />\nthe Orientation lecture on \"The<br />\nClassics.\"<br />\n\"The Classics are the foundations of our education. The student<br />\nwho has had the proper training in<br />\nLatin and Greek is bound to succeed. For it teaches the student<br />\nto think, to work out things for<br />\nhimself and enables him to do<br />\nthings in a more able and pleasant<br />\nway.\" Professor Magoffin cited numerous examples in which the<br />\nClassics had been of great aid to<br />\nmen after their graduation.<br />\nProfessor Magoffin Also showed<br />\nthat the Classics Were still of vital<br />\nimportance by telling of the action<br />\nFrance has taken recently in regard to them, to the effect that<br />\nevery student in France-must take<br />\na four year course in Latin as well<br />\nas two years of Greek. For the<br />\nFrench government realized that<br />\nthey no longer held the high place<br />\nin education which they had before<br />\nthe great war, and that in order to<br />\nregain it, they must restore Latin<br />\nand Greek.<br />\n\"Education may be divided into<br />\nthree clases, material, sentimental<br />\nand real. The material consists in<br />\ngiving the student just enough<br />\nknowledge for him to be able to<br />\nearn the 'Almighty Dollar.' But no<br />\nnotion of materialism has ever survived. The sentimental consists<br />\nin permitting the student to choose<br />\nwhat subjects appeal to him, and<br />\nto study only these. No young<br />\nman educated in this way will succeed, he is bound to be found wanting, when a crises approaches. A<br />\nreal education in anything ana<br />\neverything which is going to give<br />\nyou the basis of a well balanced education, and the thing necessary to<br />\nsuch an education is-the Classics.<br />\nThat is why France found it necessary to adopt it. For from the<br />\nClassics spring the \u2022Sciences, Philosophy and other subjects.\"<br />\nTopics Include Religion<br />\n<br />\nProfessor Magoffin's address<br />\nwas one of the series of Orientation lectures, which are being given in order to help the freshmen<br />\n\"find themselves\" in University<br />\nlife.

MAGOFFIN DEFENDS<br />\nCLASSICS<br />\n\"Latin and Greek Are the Foundation<br />\nof Our Education,\" Former Hopkins Professor Tells N. Y. U. Class<br /><br />\n\"The student who has had a<br />\nclassical education is superior to<br />\nthe student who lacks this advantage,\" Prof. Ralph Van Deman<br />\nMagoffin, head of the Department<br />\nof Classics at New York University, told the Heights Freshmen at<br />\nthe Orientation lecture on \"The<br />\nClassics.\"<br />\n\"The Classics are the foundations of our education. The student<br />\nwho has had the proper training in<br />\nLatin and Greek is bound to succeed. For it teaches the student<br />\nto think, to work out things for<br />\nhimself and enables him to do<br />\nthings in a more able and pleasant<br />\nway.\" Professor Magoffin cited numerous examples in which the<br />\nClassics had been of great aid to<br />\nmen after their graduation.<br />\nProfessor Magoffin Also showed<br />\nthat the Classics Were still of vital<br />\nimportance by telling of the action<br />\nFrance has taken recently in regard to them, to the effect that<br />\nevery student in France-must take<br />\na four year course in Latin as well<br />\nas two years of Greek. For the<br />\nFrench government realized that<br />\nthey no longer held the high place<br />\nin education which they had before<br />\nthe great war, and that in order to<br />\nregain it, they must restore Latin<br />\nand Greek.<br />\n\"Education may be divided into<br />\nthree clases, material, sentimental<br />\nand real. The material consists in<br />\ngiving the student just enough<br />\nknowledge for him to be able to<br />\nearn the 'Almighty Dollar.' But no<br />\nnotion of materialism has ever survived. The sentimental consists<br />\nin permitting the student to choose<br />\nwhat subjects appeal to him, and<br />\nto study only these. No young<br />\nman educated in this way will succeed, he is bound to be found wanting, when a crises approaches. A<br />\nreal education in anything ana<br />\neverything which is going to give<br />\nyou the basis of a well balanced education, and the thing necessary to<br />\nsuch an education is-the Classics.<br />\nThat is why France found it necessary to adopt it.
