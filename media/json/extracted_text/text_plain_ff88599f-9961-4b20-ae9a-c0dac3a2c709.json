Foremost among these is the<br />\n!s ulting strain upon the nervous system of the student, which strain<br />\nas, in severe and extreme cases, been. known to produce temporary<br />\n1Ea ad mild forms of insanity.<br />\nIn the great majority of colleges this disadvantage and danger<br />\nis been minimized by allowing'the student ample time for preparaon and by spreading the examinations over a sufficient period. At<br />\nrinceton, for instance, the students are allowed ten days'in which<br />\nI prepare and then the examinations are only held on later days.<br />\nAt Johns Hopkins the tendency has been to crowd them into as<br />\n7ief a period as possible. Formerly, one day was allowed before<br />\nlals and the examinations were evenly distributed throughout one<br />\neek. This year, not only was the one day's interim eliminated, but<br />\n.e finals were crowded, for the most part, into the first few days.<br />\nJristances have arisen where men have been forced to take five examiLtions in the first two days and four three-hour exams on Monday<br />\na td Tuesday are the rule rather than the exception.<br />\n- We are not asking for an introduction of the Princeton system<br />\nal Ld we realize the difficulties which accompany the fixing of 'a. satisfa ctory examination schedule. It does seem essential, however, that<br />\nthe period allotted to mid-years and finals be lengthened and that the<br />\nex aminations be more evenly distributed. If one week proves insufient we see no obstacle in the way of allowing ten days or a fortflI: ht.<br />\nTwelve hours of examinations in two days is not only unsatisfa:tory ; it is dangerous..<br />\nVISITORS<br />\nWhen a man is in the privacy of his own home, unobserved by<br />\nth e outside world, he is not always so careful of his apirearance or of<br />\nhi ; actions.

Just what the other students<br />\nof medicine will be able to do is<br />\nunknown as the burden of studies<br />\nfalls heavily upon each student, preventing much outside work. However, two natives of the Philippine<br />\nIslands, who played in some of the<br />\nearlier matches,\" are expected to<br />\nkeep their opponents busy.<br />\nAfter a rather dubious start, the<br />\nHopkins net team, aided by the two<br />\ncandidates from the Medical School<br />\nand stiff practice with various tennis stars of the city, found itself<br />\nand finished the seasOn with a string<br />\n.of victories. Included in these victo-ir es are wins over-Delaware arid<br />\nLoyola and a tie with the University of Maryland. Unfortunately,<br />\nthis tie match will not be played<br />\noff, because of the lateness of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe individual stars of the year<br />\nhave been Captain Hofmeister,<br />\nWasserman and Wilson. The work<br />\nof these three men figured in every<br />\nvictory. Hofmeister is well-known<br />\nin local sport circles and, although<br />\nonly a sophomore, played such a<br />\ngood brand of tennis in his Freshman year that he was elected captain for the past season. Before<br />\ncoming to Hopkins, Hofmeister<br />\nplayed for City College and one of<br />\nthe local park teams. Wasserman,<br />\nalso a former City College racquetter, is playing his first season for<br />\nHopkins. His steadiness and forehand driving combined, make him<br />\none of the most feared players -on<br />\nthe team. Wilson plays the hardest game of the trig and, as shown<br />\nin his match with Weber, of Maryland, is at his best against a player<br />\nwho continually lobs.<br />\nProspects for next year are particularly bright, as most of the reserve men are freshmen.

Foremost among these is the<br />\n!s ulting strain upon the nervous system of the student, which strain<br />\nas, in severe and extreme cases, been. known to produce temporary<br />\n1Ea ad mild forms of insanity.<br />\nIn the great majority of colleges this disadvantage and danger<br />\nis been minimized by allowing'the student ample time for preparaon and by spreading the examinations over a sufficient period. At<br />\nrinceton, for instance, the students are allowed ten days'in which<br />\nI prepare and then the examinations are only held on later days.<br />\nAt Johns Hopkins the tendency has been to crowd them into as<br />\n7ief a period as possible. Formerly, one day was allowed before<br />\nlals and the examinations were evenly distributed throughout one<br />\neek. This year, not only was the one day's interim eliminated, but<br />\n.e finals were crowded, for the most part, into the first few days.<br />\nJristances have arisen where men have been forced to take five examiLtions in the first two days and four three-hour exams on Monday<br />\na td Tuesday are the rule rather than the exception.<br />\n- We are not asking for an introduction of the Princeton system<br />\nal Ld we realize the difficulties which accompany the fixing of 'a. satisfa ctory examination schedule. It does seem essential, however, that<br />\nthe period allotted to mid-years and finals be lengthened and that the<br />\nex aminations be more evenly distributed. If one week proves insufient we see no obstacle in the way of allowing ten days or a fortflI: ht.<br />\nTwelve hours of examinations in two days is not only unsatisfa:tory ; it is dangerous..<br />\nVISITORS<br />\nWhen a man is in the privacy of his own home, unobserved by<br />\nth e outside world, he is not always so careful of his apirearance or of<br />\nhi ; actions. When confronted by strange eyes, however, when every<br />\nNV )rd and every'deed may be used \"against him, he becomes more cauti us and acquires a certain polish and finesse.<br />\nBeginning the latter part of next week, Johns Hopkins will play<br />\nhost to several hundred strangers, many of whom are paying their<br />\nfir 3t visit to the University and receiving their first impresson.<br />\nAhers, fathers and sweethearts of the undergraduates together<br />\nwith returning alumni and their families, will be daily witnesses of<br />\nth: life and the activities of the student body.<br />\nDuring June Week Johnny Hopkins should be on his best beha vior. Actions which may go unobserved<br />\n...<br />\n.._<br />\n. in our own family circle<br />\nHi .y create a bad impression in the mind of an outsider. We are<br />\nco mizant of each other's little idiosyncrasies and petty shortcomin s and can easily forgive them. To a stranger, however, a man is<br />\nno: an individual, but is a student of Johns Hopkins.

Just what the other students<br />\nof medicine will be able to do is<br />\nunknown as the burden of studies<br />\nfalls heavily upon each student, preventing much outside work. However, two natives of the Philippine<br />\nIslands, who played in some of the<br />\nearlier matches,\" are expected to<br />\nkeep their opponents busy.<br />\nAfter a rather dubious start, the<br />\nHopkins net team, aided by the two<br />\ncandidates from the Medical School<br />\nand stiff practice with various tennis stars of the city, found itself<br />\nand finished the seasOn with a string<br />\n.of victories. Included in these victo-ir es are wins over-Delaware arid<br />\nLoyola and a tie with the University of Maryland. Unfortunately,<br />\nthis tie match will not be played<br />\noff, because of the lateness of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe individual stars of the year<br />\nhave been Captain Hofmeister,<br />\nWasserman and Wilson. The work<br />\nof these three men figured in every<br />\nvictory. Hofmeister is well-known<br />\nin local sport circles and, although<br />\nonly a sophomore, played such a<br />\ngood brand of tennis in his Freshman year that he was elected captain for the past season. Before<br />\ncoming to Hopkins, Hofmeister<br />\nplayed for City College and one of<br />\nthe local park teams. Wasserman,<br />\nalso a former City College racquetter, is playing his first season for<br />\nHopkins. His steadiness and forehand driving combined, make him<br />\none of the most feared players -on<br />\nthe team. Wilson plays the hardest game of the trig and, as shown<br />\nin his match with Weber, of Maryland, is at his best against a player<br />\nwho continually lobs.<br />\nProspects for next year are particularly bright, as most of the reserve men are freshmen.
