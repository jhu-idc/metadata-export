If<br />\ngoing out of town, he must leave a deposit to<br />\nsecure his return. He could not create holidays<br />\nto suit himself, and the students were, on their<br />\npart, bound by oath to report any master who<br />\nwas unfaithful. The burden of punctuality<br />\nalso lay with the professor. He must begin<br />\nat a certain hour, or pay a fine. He must stop<br />\nat a given bell; and to make sure of this the<br />\nstudents were bound to leave the room at<br />\nonce, and fined if they did not.<br />\nIn those days of few books, it was important that lecturers should complete the subjects<br />\nundertaken. Texts of the civil or canon law<br />\nwere, therefore, divided up into sections or<br />\npuncta, and adjusted to a time schedule. The<br />\nprofessor must reach a given punctum at the<br />\nspecified time or be subject to a fine for every<br />\nday in arrears. No skipping of chapters was<br />\nallowed to make up time, for there was a committee of students known as \"Denunciatores<br />\nDoctorunt,\" who were appointed by the Rector<br />\nto take note of delinquencies. As the professor had been obliged to deposit iio with<br />\na banker at the beginning of the year as security for good conduct, the fines were deducted<br />\nfrom this \"caution money.\" Lectures by dictation still survive, but in these days of many<br />\nbooks and infinite material, the professor<br />\nshould be fined for using medimval methods.<br />\nIn the thirteenth century, university professors, as well as private school teachers, were<br />\ndependent on the fees paid them directly by<br />\nthe students, and sometimes had to haggle<br />\nover the price of their wares. One or more<br />\nstudents were employed as negotiators with<br />\nthe class, and when the attendance was large<br />\nit was possible to obtain club rates. A reminder of these mediators still remains in German universities in the \"famulus\" who carries the class books to be signed and does other<br />\nsmall services for the professor. Stated sala-<br />\n<br />\nries paid by city or state authorities came<br />\nslowly into use as means to induce professors<br />\nto settle in a new place. In the fifteenth century such stipends had fully become customary in Bologna, but the system of fines also<br />\ncontinued. The lecturer was even fined if he<br />\nfailed to draw students. For every day that<br />\nthere were less than five hearers at his class<br />\nhe had to pay thirty shillings out of every<br />\nhundred of his salary. There were also fines<br />\nfor short lectures and absences. A document<br />\nin the printed archives of Bologna states that<br />\nin 1470 a learned doctor was charged \u00a384 in<br />\nfines or \"punctationes,\" because on fourteen<br />\ndifferent days he failed to attract as many as<br />\nfive students.<br />\nAt one time the professors were so much in<br />\nthe hands of the students that they were<br />\nobliged to submit to an annual election by<br />\ntheir pupils, but this power gradually fell into<br />\nthe hands of the State authorities which paid<br />\nthe salaries.<br />\nThere were certain conveniences about the<br />\ninedixval university which are worthy of<br />\nnote. Having no buildings to leave, nor any<br />\nacademic quadrangles to regret, the school<br />\ncould move to a new place without the sacrifice of its plant.\" If the municipal authorities were uncivil to students, or refused to pay<br />\nsufficient stipends to professors, the whole<br />\nbody could refuse to work, or migrate to a<br />\nmore favorable city. This happened frequently, and several of the most important<br />\nuniversities were founded by academic seceders.<br />\nUniversities were not all governed on the<br />\nplan of Bologna. The organization of Paris<br />\nwas based on a society of teachers, and Oxford<br />\nand many others followed that system. But<br />\nin all of them the student is a prominent figure, and the division into nations finds a place<br />\nunder all of the forms of government. At all<br />\nplaces immunity from the local police was the<br />\nprivilege of the scholar, and this independence<br />\nof any but academic regulations was a great<br />\nattraction to the youth of that day. Large<br />\nnumbers of students wandered from one<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nschool to another, often begging their way as<br />\nthey went in search of new men and new adventures. If the resources of learning in the<br />\nMiddle Ages seem circumscribed to us, there<br />\nwere wide limits to the gaieties. In Paris it<br />\nwas ruled that students should not wear swords<br />\nin the university meetings, for bloody conflicts<br />\nbetween factions or with towns-people were<br />\nonly too frequent. At Oxford the inhabitants<br />\nwere in actual subjection to the academic population. At Bologna, where the students governed ,themselves under the co-operative system one might have expected good order, but<br />\nsomehow the student university failed to meet<br />\neven the inedimval requirements of discipline,<br />\nand the plan was given up over three hundred<br />\nyears ago.<br />\n<br />\nJ.

When<br />\nthe man who is not on the Club hears of the<br />\njoys of the \" Easter trip,\" he says the Club<br />\nmen have a gold-bound snap. But he does not<br />\nknow the long Tuesday evenings, and afternoons, and Saturday mornings of practice and<br />\nrehearsal, when even the perfect patience of<br />\nPeters gives out, and defeat seems to stare<br />\nthe Club in the face. But all this work meets<br />\nits reward in the Easter trip, and in the maze<br />\nof old Fortress Monroe and the Richmond<br />\ngerman all the bitter memories of practice disappear, and the long self-sacrifice meets its full<br />\nreward.<br />\nThe Easter trip of this season has surpassed<br />\nany of its illustriouS predecessors. Good management, good leaders, good clubs\u2014have all<br />\nadded fresh fame to the name of Johns Hop1<br />\n<br />\n461.<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nkins. In the joint concert held with Princeton's fine clubs Hopkins made a good showing, and Harwood, more comical than ever,<br />\nmade the hit of the evening, while the Hopkins Quartette stood next in the favor of the<br />\ncrowd that filled to overflowing the ballroom<br />\nof the Hygeia Hotel. Princeton was well met<br />\non the musical field, but in the lists of conviviality Princeton was vanquished by the Hopkins strength of brain and endurance, and the<br />\nwayside was strewn with Nassau's fallen. For<br />\nother fields of action Hopkins bore itself nobly,<br />\nand the suppression of the taleful slot machine<br />\nthat lures the freshman to ruin will go down<br />\nto posterity as another noteworthy contribution of Johns Hopkins men to the progress of<br />\nthe nation's moral development. The Clubs'<br />\nthree sunny days at Old Point, so fruitful in<br />\nromantic adventure and pleasant memories,<br />\nquickly melted away, and, in spite of the<br />\nswarming millions of small-pox bacteria, the<br />\nNorfolk concert was given. Then followed<br />\nthe early morning sail across historic Hampton Roads, with its vast possibilities for painful parting, and the special car to Richmond.<br />\nHere the Clubs played for charity in the brilliant ballroom of the Jefferson Hotel, one of<br />\nthe three finest public houses in the country.<br />\nThe managers of the charity entertained the<br />\nmen, and that rare Virginia hospitality was<br />\ndispensed in every way, so as to leave a very<br />\nsweet savor of Richmond in the mind of<br />\nevery Hopkins man. The Clubs were met<br />\nat the train, their luggage was carried to<br />\nthe allotted houses, and the whole crowd was<br />\npassed free over the street railway. In the afternoon a general invitation to the Country<br />\nClub was issued. After the concert the men<br />\nsaw all the far-famed Richmond girls in one<br />\nbig bunch at the Tuesday german. And so,<br />\nin the pleasantest and most successful way,<br />\nended the long-anticipated Easter trip. With<br />\nit practically ends the season for the musical<br />\nclubs. There still remain the Washington concert on April 17, and the athletic exhibition,<br />\nwhen the best clubs we have had for years will<br />\nsing and play for the last time this year.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nZhe fflebniartter.<br />\nPublished Portnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents of THU JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\n<br />\nAPRIL<br />\n<br />\n12,<br />\n<br />\n1899.<br />\n<br />\nSubscription $1.5o per year. 15 cents a single copy.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\nWILLIAM P.

It is a time-honored subject, more's the pity, and there is nothing new<br />\nunder the sun to be said about it. The most<br />\nwe can do is to say again what has been said<br />\nso many times before. There may be virtue<br />\nin its repetition.<br />\nIt takes money to run teams; outfits,<br />\ngrounds, rubbers, traveling expenses\u2014all<br />\nthese are items on the bill, and guarantees<br />\nmust be given to visiting contestants. The<br />\nlocker fund is, indeed, a great boon to our<br />\nathletics, but we have had occasion to hear<br />\nmore than once this winter that it is insufficient<br />\nto meet the needs of our expanding interests.<br />\nGate receipts are still a factor in the problem<br />\nof support. The card of admission must be<br />\nreckoned with. This is the end of the first<br />\nlesson : Let us see that our teams do not<br />\nsuffer for financial backing, keep a sweet temper when we are next approached with a ticket<br />\nfor \"Saturday's game,\" and pay the price with<br />\na fine sense of loyalty.<br />\n<br />\nBUT there is an equally important consideration : The inspiration to our teams, the<br />\nwinning pace, that a rollicking crowd of root-<br />\n<br />\ners can give. Every mother's son of us is<br />\nhuman; we all can stand encouragement now<br />\nand then, nay more\u2014need it, and right badly<br />\ndo we need it, when the game, whether of life<br />\nor at ball, is going the wrong way. When our<br />\ntroops were in the trenches before Santiago a<br />\nsweltering evening last July, brave men dispirited by fatigue, hunger and anxiety, the<br />\nbands along the line struck up a national air.<br />\nIt meant new life, and hope, and power for<br />\nour fighters at the front. And so a rousing<br />\n\"Hullabaloo I\" with a rattling \"Rah, Johnny \" can do a good deal for the Black and<br />\nBlue, as was done for the Red, White and<br />\nBlue, on our more peaceful but as momentous<br />\nconflicts on the athletic field. Bring up your<br />\nband of rooters. This, then, is the end of the<br />\nsecond lesson: Go to the games, and go to<br />\nroot!<br />\n<br />\nOF COURSE, the teams have a hand in the<br />\nmatter. If they seek the support of the University, they must give us good, clean and<br />\nearnest exhibitions, the best work of which<br />\nthey are capable, whatever the sport. This is<br />\nall we can expect. This much we do expect,<br />\nand have a right to exact. There is no excuse<br />\nfor \"ragged bail\" or \"ragged\" work of any<br />\nkind. \" Ragged\" play means careless play.<br />\nNothing will so quickly kill a crowd. And,<br />\nfurthermore, the conduct of the teams must<br />\nbe thoroughly sportsmanlike. Last year, notably on the ball team, there were several instances, unpleasant to recall, that cast odium,<br />\nnot only on the men concerned, but the management that permitted such unsportsmanlike<br />\nconduct on the field. It is a bad way to encourage attendance at the games. And this is<br />\nthe conclusion : We do not expect our teams<br />\nto win all the time; we do expect them to give<br />\nus good, clean sport, and make us no occasion<br />\nfor apologies in their behalf, and for staying<br />\naway from the games.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nTHE GRAVE IN BUSENTO.<br />\nPLATEN.<br />\n<br />\nNightly o'er Busento murmur near Cosenza<br />\nsongs of pain;<br />\nFrom its waters peals an answer and in echo<br />\nrings again.<br />\nGhostly Goths along the river up and down<br />\nits margin tread,\u2014<br />\nWarriors Alaric bewailing, noblest of their<br />\npeople's (lead.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nLECTURES AND LECTURERS.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Steiner is at present delivering as a part<br />\nof the teachers' course a series of four lectures<br />\non American history.<br />\not<br />\nwill conclude with a<br />\ncourse<br />\nThe teachers'<br />\nin Japan, to be<br />\neducation<br />\nAmerican<br />\nlecture on<br />\n21, by Dr.<br />\nApril<br />\nevening,<br />\nFriday<br />\ngiven on<br />\nN.

If this score<br />\ncould only be maintained. with, perhaps, a<br />\nfew runs of our own, for three more innings,<br />\nwhat a splendid showing it would be for us,<br />\nand what a check to the aspirations of the<br />\nproud Princetonians.<br />\nOur men seemed to be getting their share<br />\nof the hits, and, had it not been for a little<br />\nstupid coaching and poor base-running in the<br />\nfirst inning, there is no reason why a run or<br />\ntwo might not have been scored then. The<br />\none great defect in our playing was the rattled<br />\ncondition of most of the infield\u2014old players,<br />\ntoo, whom one would not expect to be so affected.<br />\nLet us hope that the name and fame of those<br />\nof the smaller Maryland colleges against which<br />\n<br />\nwe shall play will not have such a terrifying<br />\neffect upon our fielders.<br />\nSome apprehension was felt as to the expediency of opposing to the Orange and Black<br />\nbatsmen our youngest pitcher, who was comparatively inexperienced. But all fears were<br />\nset at rest by the perfect coolness and control<br />\nwhich he exhibited, and the manner in which<br />\nhe kept his head in critical situations brought<br />\nforth frequent applause from the spectators.<br />\nHis pitching, with the fine catching of Radcliffe, was, indeed, the star work of the afternoon. It really seemed as though the new<br />\nmen were cool, and that the older players were<br />\nshowing the nervousness.<br />\nAt the beginning of the sixth inning, the<br />\nscore stood 3 to o. Here the Black and Blue<br />\nwent to pieces, and by means of a few wellplaced hits, together with some awful fielding<br />\nby Hopkins, the Princetonians piled up eight<br />\nruns. In the next inning two more came, and<br />\nwe began to feel a pang of bitter disappointment. Twelve to nothing ! 0! for a few<br />\nruns to save a shut-out 1<br />\nNow came a specimen of really good playing by the home team. Radcliffe made a twobagger, the best hit of the game, and it would<br />\nbe disgraceful if he were not allowed to get<br />\nhome now. Griffin next made a fine sacrifice<br />\nto first, sending Radcliffe to third. All depended on Swainc now, and he responded<br />\nnobly with a pretty grounder that brought<br />\nRadcliffe home with the only run of the game.<br />\nTaken as a whole, the result was encouraging, for it was better than was expected but,<br />\nafter the fine showing for the first six innings,<br />\nthe final let-up was disappointing.<br />\nThe score (12 to 1) does not accurately<br />\nshow the general run of the game, which was<br />\nmuch less one-sided than might be imagined.<br />\nPrinceton made seven hits to our six, which<br />\nwas not at all bad for our side. Errors were<br />\nwhat did the business.<br />\nThe game showed the effects of our lack of<br />\ncoaching and outdoor training. If our infield<br />\nwill brace up a little, and our outfield learn to<br />\njudge long flies a little better, we can look for<br />\nsome good results before the season closes.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nLACROSSE WITH COLUMBIA. \u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe first game of our hoped-for second<br />\nchampionship season has been played and won,<br />\nand there is no reason why every Hopkins man<br />\nshould not feel delighted with the result of the<br />\ngame, especially so when it is recollected that<br />\nthere were six new men on the team.<br />\nThe game was called at four o'clock. One<br />\nminute after the ball had been faced, after a<br />\npretty catch, it was shot through Columbia's<br />\ngoal. Twice again did they repeat this trick,<br />\nand then, after a couple of lightning Hopkins<br />\npasses, Covert shot a goal for Columbia. When<br />\ntime was called, Hopkins led by four goals<br />\nto one.<br />\nIn the second half both teams played hard.<br />\nOur men seemed very much fagged out at<br />\ntimes. This, however, was probably due to the<br />\nmistake of asking the team to travel two hundred miles and play the game one hour later.<br />\nColumbia at times played desperately, but were<br />\nhindered from scoring by the magnificent work<br />\nof Guggenheimer, who seems to be in rare<br />\nform this season.<br />\nMaddren played his old star game, and by his<br />\nbrilliant work showed that he is one of the<br />\nmainstays on the defense ; he should not aspire<br />\nto play on the attack. Griffin, Tyler and Bruton did very well for green men, but they<br />\nshould not neglect to practice. Jones, with his<br />\nfamiliar old slash and telling body-check, was<br />\nvery much in evidence. It is a pity that Abercrombie was not feeling his best, for although<br />\nhe played his position very well, his work did<br />\nnot follow the pace he set in last year's Lehigh<br />\ngame. Fitzgerald played a magnificent game,<br />\nespecially in the first half, and the same may be<br />\nsaid of Grimes. As was aptly remarked by a<br />\nColumbia man: \"McInnes is the best in-home<br />\nin the business,\" and his score of four goals<br />\ntells the tale. Preston, although good behind<br />\ngoal, should practice catching tips, as he missed<br />\ntoo many passes at critical moments. Sayler,<br />\nthough really a defense man, played a very<br />\ngood game, and made a brilliant play in the<br />\nsecond half by scoring a difficult goal.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nOn the whole, we should all be satisfied and<br />\nshould hope that the good work may be kept<br />\nup, and thus, once more, our trophy room may<br />\nbe adorned with a championship banner.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows :<br />\nCOLUMBIA<br />\nJ.

If<br />\ngoing out of town, he must leave a deposit to<br />\nsecure his return. He could not create holidays<br />\nto suit himself, and the students were, on their<br />\npart, bound by oath to report any master who<br />\nwas unfaithful. The burden of punctuality<br />\nalso lay with the professor. He must begin<br />\nat a certain hour, or pay a fine. He must stop<br />\nat a given bell; and to make sure of this the<br />\nstudents were bound to leave the room at<br />\nonce, and fined if they did not.<br />\nIn those days of few books, it was important that lecturers should complete the subjects<br />\nundertaken. Texts of the civil or canon law<br />\nwere, therefore, divided up into sections or<br />\npuncta, and adjusted to a time schedule. The<br />\nprofessor must reach a given punctum at the<br />\nspecified time or be subject to a fine for every<br />\nday in arrears. No skipping of chapters was<br />\nallowed to make up time, for there was a committee of students known as \"Denunciatores<br />\nDoctorunt,\" who were appointed by the Rector<br />\nto take note of delinquencies. As the professor had been obliged to deposit iio with<br />\na banker at the beginning of the year as security for good conduct, the fines were deducted<br />\nfrom this \"caution money.\" Lectures by dictation still survive, but in these days of many<br />\nbooks and infinite material, the professor<br />\nshould be fined for using medimval methods.<br />\nIn the thirteenth century, university professors, as well as private school teachers, were<br />\ndependent on the fees paid them directly by<br />\nthe students, and sometimes had to haggle<br />\nover the price of their wares. One or more<br />\nstudents were employed as negotiators with<br />\nthe class, and when the attendance was large<br />\nit was possible to obtain club rates. A reminder of these mediators still remains in German universities in the \"famulus\" who carries the class books to be signed and does other<br />\nsmall services for the professor. Stated sala-<br /><br />\nries paid by city or state authorities came<br />\nslowly into use as means to induce professors<br />\nto settle in a new place. In the fifteenth century such stipends had fully become customary in Bologna, but the system of fines also<br />\ncontinued. The lecturer was even fined if he<br />\nfailed to draw students. For every day that<br />\nthere were less than five hearers at his class<br />\nhe had to pay thirty shillings out of every<br />\nhundred of his salary. There were also fines<br />\nfor short lectures and absences. A document<br />\nin the printed archives of Bologna states that<br />\nin 1470 a learned doctor was charged \u00a384 in<br />\nfines or \"punctationes,\" because on fourteen<br />\ndifferent days he failed to attract as many as<br />\nfive students.<br />\nAt one time the professors were so much in<br />\nthe hands of the students that they were<br />\nobliged to submit to an annual election by<br />\ntheir pupils, but this power gradually fell into<br />\nthe hands of the State authorities which paid<br />\nthe salaries.<br />\nThere were certain conveniences about the<br />\ninedixval university which are worthy of<br />\nnote. Having no buildings to leave, nor any<br />\nacademic quadrangles to regret, the school<br />\ncould move to a new place without the sacrifice of its plant.\" If the municipal authorities were uncivil to students, or refused to pay<br />\nsufficient stipends to professors, the whole<br />\nbody could refuse to work, or migrate to a<br />\nmore favorable city. This happened frequently, and several of the most important<br />\nuniversities were founded by academic seceders.<br />\nUniversities were not all governed on the<br />\nplan of Bologna. The organization of Paris<br />\nwas based on a society of teachers, and Oxford<br />\nand many others followed that system. But<br />\nin all of them the student is a prominent figure, and the division into nations finds a place<br />\nunder all of the forms of government. At all<br />\nplaces immunity from the local police was the<br />\nprivilege of the scholar, and this independence<br />\nof any but academic regulations was a great<br />\nattraction to the youth of that day. Large<br />\nnumbers of students wandered from one<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nschool to another, often begging their way as<br />\nthey went in search of new men and new adventures. If the resources of learning in the<br />\nMiddle Ages seem circumscribed to us, there<br />\nwere wide limits to the gaieties. In Paris it<br />\nwas ruled that students should not wear swords<br />\nin the university meetings, for bloody conflicts<br />\nbetween factions or with towns-people were<br />\nonly too frequent. At Oxford the inhabitants<br />\nwere in actual subjection to the academic population. At Bologna, where the students governed ,themselves under the co-operative system one might have expected good order, but<br />\nsomehow the student university failed to meet<br />\neven the inedimval requirements of discipline,<br />\nand the plan was given up over three hundred<br />\nyears ago.<br /><br />\nJ.

VINCENT.<br />\n.0<br /><br />\n.0<br /><br />\nTHE EASTER TRIP.<br /><br />\nTo the freshman who has never tried to race<br />\nhis fingers up and down a banjo neck, and to<br />\nthe graduate who \"knows it all,\" the ease<br />\nwith which the University Banjo Club dashes<br />\noff a smashing, swinging march, and the perfect tone-shedding and self-restraint of the<br />\nGlee and Mandolin Clubs' songs and waltzes,<br />\nseems an easily acquired perfection. When<br />\nthe man who is not on the Club hears of the<br />\njoys of the \" Easter trip,\" he says the Club<br />\nmen have a gold-bound snap. But he does not<br />\nknow the long Tuesday evenings, and afternoons, and Saturday mornings of practice and<br />\nrehearsal, when even the perfect patience of<br />\nPeters gives out, and defeat seems to stare<br />\nthe Club in the face. But all this work meets<br />\nits reward in the Easter trip, and in the maze<br />\nof old Fortress Monroe and the Richmond<br />\ngerman all the bitter memories of practice disappear, and the long self-sacrifice meets its full<br />\nreward.<br />\nThe Easter trip of this season has surpassed<br />\nany of its illustriouS predecessors. Good management, good leaders, good clubs\u2014have all<br />\nadded fresh fame to the name of Johns Hop1<br /><br />\n461.<br />\n.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nkins. In the joint concert held with Princeton's fine clubs Hopkins made a good showing, and Harwood, more comical than ever,<br />\nmade the hit of the evening, while the Hopkins Quartette stood next in the favor of the<br />\ncrowd that filled to overflowing the ballroom<br />\nof the Hygeia Hotel. Princeton was well met<br />\non the musical field, but in the lists of conviviality Princeton was vanquished by the Hopkins strength of brain and endurance, and the<br />\nwayside was strewn with Nassau's fallen. For<br />\nother fields of action Hopkins bore itself nobly,<br />\nand the suppression of the taleful slot machine<br />\nthat lures the freshman to ruin will go down<br />\nto posterity as another noteworthy contribution of Johns Hopkins men to the progress of<br />\nthe nation's moral development. The Clubs'<br />\nthree sunny days at Old Point, so fruitful in<br />\nromantic adventure and pleasant memories,<br />\nquickly melted away, and, in spite of the<br />\nswarming millions of small-pox bacteria, the<br />\nNorfolk concert was given. Then followed<br />\nthe early morning sail across historic Hampton Roads, with its vast possibilities for painful parting, and the special car to Richmond.<br />\nHere the Clubs played for charity in the brilliant ballroom of the Jefferson Hotel, one of<br />\nthe three finest public houses in the country.<br />\nThe managers of the charity entertained the<br />\nmen, and that rare Virginia hospitality was<br />\ndispensed in every way, so as to leave a very<br />\nsweet savor of Richmond in the mind of<br />\nevery Hopkins man. The Clubs were met<br />\nat the train, their luggage was carried to<br />\nthe allotted houses, and the whole crowd was<br />\npassed free over the street railway. In the afternoon a general invitation to the Country<br />\nClub was issued. After the concert the men<br />\nsaw all the far-famed Richmond girls in one<br />\nbig bunch at the Tuesday german. And so,<br />\nin the pleasantest and most successful way,<br />\nended the long-anticipated Easter trip. With<br />\nit practically ends the season for the musical<br />\nclubs. There still remain the Washington concert on April 17, and the athletic exhibition,<br />\nwhen the best clubs we have had for years will<br />\nsing and play for the last time this year.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nZhe fflebniartter.<br />\nPublished Portnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents of THU JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br /><br />\nAPRIL<br /><br />\n12,<br /><br />\n1899.<br /><br />\nSubscription $1.5o per year. 15 cents a single copy.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\nWILLIAM P.

It is a time-honored subject, more's the pity, and there is nothing new<br />\nunder the sun to be said about it. The most<br />\nwe can do is to say again what has been said<br />\nso many times before. There may be virtue<br />\nin its repetition.<br />\nIt takes money to run teams; outfits,<br />\ngrounds, rubbers, traveling expenses\u2014all<br />\nthese are items on the bill, and guarantees<br />\nmust be given to visiting contestants. The<br />\nlocker fund is, indeed, a great boon to our<br />\nathletics, but we have had occasion to hear<br />\nmore than once this winter that it is insufficient<br />\nto meet the needs of our expanding interests.<br />\nGate receipts are still a factor in the problem<br />\nof support. The card of admission must be<br />\nreckoned with. This is the end of the first<br />\nlesson : Let us see that our teams do not<br />\nsuffer for financial backing, keep a sweet temper when we are next approached with a ticket<br />\nfor \"Saturday's game,\" and pay the price with<br />\na fine sense of loyalty.<br /><br />\nBUT there is an equally important consideration : The inspiration to our teams, the<br />\nwinning pace, that a rollicking crowd of root-<br /><br />\ners can give. Every mother's son of us is<br />\nhuman; we all can stand encouragement now<br />\nand then, nay more\u2014need it, and right badly<br />\ndo we need it, when the game, whether of life<br />\nor at ball, is going the wrong way. When our<br />\ntroops were in the trenches before Santiago a<br />\nsweltering evening last July, brave men dispirited by fatigue, hunger and anxiety, the<br />\nbands along the line struck up a national air.<br />\nIt meant new life, and hope, and power for<br />\nour fighters at the front. And so a rousing<br />\n\"Hullabaloo I\" with a rattling \"Rah, Johnny \" can do a good deal for the Black and<br />\nBlue, as was done for the Red, White and<br />\nBlue, on our more peaceful but as momentous<br />\nconflicts on the athletic field. Bring up your<br />\nband of rooters. This, then, is the end of the<br />\nsecond lesson: Go to the games, and go to<br />\nroot!<br /><br />\nOF COURSE, the teams have a hand in the<br />\nmatter. If they seek the support of the University, they must give us good, clean and<br />\nearnest exhibitions, the best work of which<br />\nthey are capable, whatever the sport. This is<br />\nall we can expect. This much we do expect,<br />\nand have a right to exact. There is no excuse<br />\nfor \"ragged bail\" or \"ragged\" work of any<br />\nkind. \" Ragged\" play means careless play.<br />\nNothing will so quickly kill a crowd. And,<br />\nfurthermore, the conduct of the teams must<br />\nbe thoroughly sportsmanlike. Last year, notably on the ball team, there were several instances, unpleasant to recall, that cast odium,<br />\nnot only on the men concerned, but the management that permitted such unsportsmanlike<br />\nconduct on the field. It is a bad way to encourage attendance at the games. And this is<br />\nthe conclusion : We do not expect our teams<br />\nto win all the time; we do expect them to give<br />\nus good, clean sport, and make us no occasion<br />\nfor apologies in their behalf, and for staying<br />\naway from the games.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nTHE GRAVE IN BUSENTO.<br />\nPLATEN.<br /><br />\nNightly o'er Busento murmur near Cosenza<br />\nsongs of pain;<br />\nFrom its waters peals an answer and in echo<br />\nrings again.<br />\nGhostly Goths along the river up and down<br />\nits margin tread,\u2014<br />\nWarriors Alaric bewailing, noblest of their<br />\npeople's (lead.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nLECTURES AND LECTURERS.<br /><br />\nDr. Steiner is at present delivering as a part<br />\nof the teachers' course a series of four lectures<br />\non American history.<br />\not<br />\nwill conclude with a<br />\ncourse<br />\nThe teachers'<br />\nin Japan, to be<br />\neducation<br />\nAmerican<br />\nlecture on<br />\n21, by Dr.<br />\nApril<br />\nevening,<br />\nFriday<br />\ngiven on<br />\nN.

If this score<br />\ncould only be maintained. with, perhaps, a<br />\nfew runs of our own, for three more innings,<br />\nwhat a splendid showing it would be for us,<br />\nand what a check to the aspirations of the<br />\nproud Princetonians.<br />\nOur men seemed to be getting their share<br />\nof the hits, and, had it not been for a little<br />\nstupid coaching and poor base-running in the<br />\nfirst inning, there is no reason why a run or<br />\ntwo might not have been scored then. The<br />\none great defect in our playing was the rattled<br />\ncondition of most of the infield\u2014old players,<br />\ntoo, whom one would not expect to be so affected.<br />\nLet us hope that the name and fame of those<br />\nof the smaller Maryland colleges against which<br /><br />\nwe shall play will not have such a terrifying<br />\neffect upon our fielders.<br />\nSome apprehension was felt as to the expediency of opposing to the Orange and Black<br />\nbatsmen our youngest pitcher, who was comparatively inexperienced. But all fears were<br />\nset at rest by the perfect coolness and control<br />\nwhich he exhibited, and the manner in which<br />\nhe kept his head in critical situations brought<br />\nforth frequent applause from the spectators.<br />\nHis pitching, with the fine catching of Radcliffe, was, indeed, the star work of the afternoon. It really seemed as though the new<br />\nmen were cool, and that the older players were<br />\nshowing the nervousness.<br />\nAt the beginning of the sixth inning, the<br />\nscore stood 3 to o. Here the Black and Blue<br />\nwent to pieces, and by means of a few wellplaced hits, together with some awful fielding<br />\nby Hopkins, the Princetonians piled up eight<br />\nruns. In the next inning two more came, and<br />\nwe began to feel a pang of bitter disappointment. Twelve to nothing ! 0! for a few<br />\nruns to save a shut-out 1<br />\nNow came a specimen of really good playing by the home team. Radcliffe made a twobagger, the best hit of the game, and it would<br />\nbe disgraceful if he were not allowed to get<br />\nhome now. Griffin next made a fine sacrifice<br />\nto first, sending Radcliffe to third. All depended on Swainc now, and he responded<br />\nnobly with a pretty grounder that brought<br />\nRadcliffe home with the only run of the game.<br />\nTaken as a whole, the result was encouraging, for it was better than was expected but,<br />\nafter the fine showing for the first six innings,<br />\nthe final let-up was disappointing.<br />\nThe score (12 to 1) does not accurately<br />\nshow the general run of the game, which was<br />\nmuch less one-sided than might be imagined.<br />\nPrinceton made seven hits to our six, which<br />\nwas not at all bad for our side. Errors were<br />\nwhat did the business.<br />\nThe game showed the effects of our lack of<br />\ncoaching and outdoor training. If our infield<br />\nwill brace up a little, and our outfield learn to<br />\njudge long flies a little better, we can look for<br />\nsome good results before the season closes.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nLACROSSE WITH COLUMBIA. \u2022<br /><br />\nThe first game of our hoped-for second<br />\nchampionship season has been played and won,<br />\nand there is no reason why every Hopkins man<br />\nshould not feel delighted with the result of the<br />\ngame, especially so when it is recollected that<br />\nthere were six new men on the team.<br />\nThe game was called at four o'clock. One<br />\nminute after the ball had been faced, after a<br />\npretty catch, it was shot through Columbia's<br />\ngoal. Twice again did they repeat this trick,<br />\nand then, after a couple of lightning Hopkins<br />\npasses, Covert shot a goal for Columbia. When<br />\ntime was called, Hopkins led by four goals<br />\nto one.<br />\nIn the second half both teams played hard.<br />\nOur men seemed very much fagged out at<br />\ntimes. This, however, was probably due to the<br />\nmistake of asking the team to travel two hundred miles and play the game one hour later.<br />\nColumbia at times played desperately, but were<br />\nhindered from scoring by the magnificent work<br />\nof Guggenheimer, who seems to be in rare<br />\nform this season.<br />\nMaddren played his old star game, and by his<br />\nbrilliant work showed that he is one of the<br />\nmainstays on the defense ; he should not aspire<br />\nto play on the attack. Griffin, Tyler and Bruton did very well for green men, but they<br />\nshould not neglect to practice. Jones, with his<br />\nfamiliar old slash and telling body-check, was<br />\nvery much in evidence. It is a pity that Abercrombie was not feeling his best, for although<br />\nhe played his position very well, his work did<br />\nnot follow the pace he set in last year's Lehigh<br />\ngame. Fitzgerald played a magnificent game,<br />\nespecially in the first half, and the same may be<br />\nsaid of Grimes. As was aptly remarked by a<br />\nColumbia man: \"McInnes is the best in-home<br />\nin the business,\" and his score of four goals<br />\ntells the tale. Preston, although good behind<br />\ngoal, should practice catching tips, as he missed<br />\ntoo many passes at critical moments. Sayler,<br />\nthough really a defense man, played a very<br />\ngood game, and made a brilliant play in the<br />\nsecond half by scoring a difficult goal.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nOn the whole, we should all be satisfied and<br />\nshould hope that the good work may be kept<br />\nup, and thus, once more, our trophy room may<br />\nbe adorned with a championship banner.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows :<br />\nCOLUMBIA<br />\nJ.
