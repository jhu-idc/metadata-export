An<br />\nalumnus of SAIS, Blitzer, who<br />\nhas been studying the Middle<br />\nEast for a book on U.S.-Israeli<br />\nrelations, feels that Sadat's assassination will not change Egypt's<br />\nrelations with Israel considerably.<br />\n<br />\nEgypt's peace with Israel<br />\nhas been achieved after lengthy<br />\nnegotiations and compromises,<br />\nBlitzer said. Blitzer feels that<br />\nnew President Hosni Mubarak is<br />\nnot willing to sacrifice that<br />\npeace. \"Mubarak is not going to<br />\nbe a transitory leader,\" he said.<br />\n\"I believe the peace will continue to exist, even with Sadat's<br />\nassassination.\"<br />\nBlitzer expressed confidence<br />\nin Mubarak. He sees Mubarak as<br />\n<br />\na strong political force in his<br />\ncountry \u2014 a man who as VicePresident moved up strategically<br />\nto the position where he became<br />\nSadat's heir apparent. Under<br />\nMubarak, Blitzer said, Egypt will<br />\nmove toward better relations<br />\nwith other Arab nations. Egypt's<br />\nisolation from neighboring Arab<br />\ncountries under Sadat was in<br />\npart due to personal differences<br />\nbetween Sadat and the leaders of<br />\nthose nations, according to<br />\nBlitzer.<br />\n<br />\nCivic Association Releases Report<br />\nOn Charles Street Safety Hazards<br />\ncont. from p. I<br />\nbound. Because the street carries<br />\nmostly northbound traffic, the<br />\npedestrian instinctively pays<br />\nmost attention to the northbound lanes. As a result, there is<br />\na tendency to neglect the<br />\nsouthbound lanes, the report<br />\nstates.<br />\nIn order to substantiate its<br />\nclaim of the danger posed by the<br />\ncenter southbound lane, the report cites accident figures for<br />\nthe period between 1975 and<br />\n1979. In that period, there were<br />\n11 accidents involving pedestrians in the southbound lane and<br />\njust one in the three northbound<br />\nlanes.<br />\nTo alleviate these problems,<br />\nthe report recommends three<br />\npossible solutions., the installation of rumble strips in the<br />\ncenter southbound lane, the conversion of the center roadway<br />\ninto two southbound and two<br />\nnorthbound lanes, or the separation of the center southbound<br />\nlane and northbound lanes by a<br />\nmedian strip.<br />\nThe installation of rumble<br />\nstrips in the center southbound<br />\nlane would, the report states,<br />\nalert pedestrians to the approach<br />\nof vehicles. A metal grating strip<br />\nwould be preferable to the<br />\nconventional rumble strip, the<br />\ncommittee feels, because the<br />\nnoise produced when a vehicle's<br />\ntires hit the grating is more<br />\naudible. The report proposes<br />\ninstalling the strips a short<br />\ndistance before each intersection.<br />\nThe second option of con-<br />\n<br />\nverting the main roadway into<br />\ntwo lanes each way would<br />\neliminate the deception of the<br />\npresent arrangement, the report<br />\nsays. Although this plan would<br />\ncause an increase in congestion<br />\nin the northbound lanes, the<br />\ncommittee's observations show<br />\nthat only 23 percent of the<br />\nnorthbound traffic uses the lane<br />\nthat would be converted. The<br />\ncommittee feels that after a<br />\nperiod of adjustment, commuters will find alternative<br />\nroutes and that the final increase<br />\nin congestion on Charles Street<br />\nwill be minimal.<br />\nThe third alternative would<br />\nbe to construct a median between the north and southbound<br />\nlanes. This would serve to<br />\nremind pedestrians of the change<br />\nof traffic direction as well as<br />\nproviding the pedestrian with a<br />\nsafe place to stand between<br />\nopposing lanes of traffic. However, since the lanes of Charles<br />\nStreet are only ten feet wide,<br />\nthis option would entail the<br />\nelimination of one of the northbound lanes. As with the second<br />\nalternative, this would increase<br />\ncongestion in the remaining<br />\nlanes, but the committee feels<br />\nthat this problem is offset by the<br />\nincreased safety the median will<br />\nprovide.<br />\nWhile concentrating on<br />\nthese three options, the report<br />\nalso suggests that traffic and<br />\npedestrian crossing lines be more<br />\nclearly marked and that a<br />\npedestrian crossing signal be<br />\ninstalled at 33rd Street. The<br />\ncommittee also .suggests that<br />\n<br />\nwhat it terms \"a considerable<br />\namount of speeding\" could<br />\nbe alleviated by stricter enforcement of the speed limit by<br />\npolice.<br />\nThe fate of the proposed<br />\nchanges is now in the hands of<br />\nthe Mayor, the City Council, and<br />\nthe Department of Transit and<br />\nTraffic.<br />\n<br />\nBlitzer spoke at length<br />\nabout U.S.-Israeli relations, giving a historical perspective. He<br />\ndenied the contention of several<br />\nMiddle East observers that the<br />\n\"honeymoon\" between Israel<br />\nand Washington is over because<br />\nof the sale of the AWACS to<br />\nSaudi Arabia. Noting that the<br />\nfirst year of the presidency has<br />\nhistorically been a bad one for<br />\nU.S.-Israeli relations, Blitzer<br />\nmaintained that the friendship<br />\nbetween the two nations is<br />\nresilient enough to survive<br />\nclashes because maintaining<br />\ngood relations is in the best<br />\ninterests of both.<br />\nThe U.S. cannot ignore<br />\nIsrael as a military strength in<br />\nthe Middle East, and a strategically important country, Blitzer<br />\nadded. As for Israel, the U.S.,<br />\nwith the largest population of<br />\nJewish people, has to be taken<br />\ninto consideration before making a policy decision. \"Every<br />\nIsraeli government is going to<br />\nhave to temper its activities to<br />\ntake the U.S. into consideration,\" he said.<br />\n<br />\nStudent members will be<br />\nchosen by the Student Council,<br />\nguided by recommendations to<br />\nbe made by SHAC in conjunction with the Student Council<br />\non<br />\nCommittees<br />\nCommittee<br />\n(COC).

To avoid this problem,<br />\nthe Council decided to grant ad<br />\nhoc status to SHAC, thereby<br />\nreleasing it from the constitutional constraint that all permanent Council committees<br />\nhave their chairmen selected<br />\nby Council members themselves.<br />\n<br />\nAcademic Council To Consider<br />\nChanges In Ethics Constitution<br />\nBY PETER YAROSCHUK<br />\nThe Student Council met<br />\nwith the Undergraduate Academic Ethics Board Oct. 21 to<br />\ndraft some proposals aimed at<br />\nimproving the Ethics Board<br />\nConstitution.<br />\nThe present constitution,<br />\nthough providing the student<br />\nwith a mechanism for disputing<br />\nand fighting a cheating charge,<br />\nallegedly fails to inform the<br />\nstudent of his other rights,<br />\nallows many cases to go unexamined by the Board (often to the<br />\nstudent's detriment), and gives<br />\nthe student few alternatives.<br />\nUnder the new amendments, when a student is caught<br />\ncheating the professor must<br />\nconfront the student.

The Financial<br />\nAid Office \"cannot require the<br />\nnoncustodial parent to provide<br />\nsupport that isn't forthcoming,\"<br />\nshe explained. Neither Roberts<br />\nnor Gray denied that the above<br />\ncases could have occurred but<br />\nthey said such things are less<br />\nlikely to happen now that the<br />\noffice has begun to ask for<br />\nincome tax statements from<br />\nboth parents and to require<br />\nassistance from the noncustodial<br />\nparent as well.<br />\nDeclaring financial independence is yet another way that<br />\nstudents can receive federal aid<br />\nthat they would not be entitled<br />\nto otherwise. In the past, Hopkins students who declared independence from parental support were given \"full budget<br />\nconsideration\" and were eligible<br />\nto a separate reserve of federal<br />\nfunds. This policy has been<br />\nmodified at Hopkins in part<br />\nbecause, according to Gray, it<br />\nencouraged students, many of<br />\nwhom came from wealthy families, to \"become independent so<br />\nthat they'd be eligible for aid.\"<br />\nNow Hopkins interviews<br />\neach student who declares financial independence to ascertain<br />\nhis or her status, but, as Gray<br />\npointed out, Hopkins is more<br />\ncareful than a great number of<br />\nother schools in its allocation of<br />\naid because institutional funds<br />\nare also involved. At many<br />\ncolleges where federal aid is the<br />\nbulk or even all of the financial<br />\n<br />\ncont.from p. I<br />\nably cheat the system and get<br />\naway with it.<br />\napHowever, students<br />\nproached on the subject generally place the estimate considerably higher. \"Oh,almost everyone<br />\ncheats on the FAF,\" claimed<br />\none Hopkins student. One<br />\nreason that students feel cheating on the FAF is prevalent is<br />\nthat many of them know fellow<br />\nstudents who have provided false<br />\ninformation and receive additional aid as a result. \"I know a<br />\ngirl who writes that she's a New<br />\nYork resident even though she<br />\nlives in Maryland,\" said one<br />\njunior. \"New York supposedly<br />\nhas more money so she gets aid<br />\nthat she wouldn't as a Maryland<br />\nresident. She seems pretty proud<br />\nof it too.\"<br />\nAnother way in which some<br />\nstudents cheat is by including<br />\nthe income of only one of their<br />\nparents on the FAF although<br />\nboth parents are working. This is<br />\nmore frequently the case with<br />\nstudents whose parents are divorced. In these cases, the<br />\nfederal government is often told<br />\nthat the parent with the lower<br />\nincome is supporting the student<br />\nwhen in fact both arents may<br />\nbe sharing the expi c. Through<br />\nthird-party source the Newsal cases in<br />\nLetter learned of s<br />\nwhich a student vvi ise parents<br />\nare divorced receives financial<br />\naid but also is supprted financially by both parents while the<br />\nsupport of only one parent is<br />\nreported.<br />\nAccording to Financial Aid<br />\n<br />\naid furnished, financial aid offices fail to check the status of<br />\neach individual before parcelling<br />\nout federal funds, making it<br />\neasier for students to receive<br />\nfederal aid, whether or not they<br />\nare legitimately independent.<br />\nThe number of siblings in<br />\ncollege is another factor that<br />\ndetermines a student's financial<br />\nneed. Theoretically, it is difficult<br />\nto cheat on the number of<br />\nbrothers and sisters one has<br />\nbecause the information provided has to be consistent with<br />\nvarious forms that contain their<br />\nnames and ages. One student<br />\ninformed the News-Letter, however, that the student's parents<br />\nclaim an additional dependent<br />\non the FAF. The student feels<br />\ncertain that the Financial Aid<br />\nOffice will not question this<br />\npiece of information because it<br />\nis consistent with the income tax<br />\nforms.<br />\nCheating on the FAF has<br />\nbeen compared to cheating on<br />\nFederal Income Tax forms. One<br />\nmajor difference, however, is<br />\nthat there is a federal agency,<br />\nthe IRS,that investigates income<br />\ntax fraud whereas the FAF is<br />\nreviewed only by a college<br />\nfinancial aid office that is aimed<br />\nat helping students meet educational needs, not at policing<br />\nfraud. The result is that few<br />\npeople are caught falsifying<br />\ninformation on the FAF.<br />\nThis is not to say that<br />\ncollege financial aid offices are<br />\nnot doing their job. For the<br />\nmost part, administrators are<br />\naware of the problem.

The Financial Aid Office<br />\ncan refer cases to the Department of Education, but that is<br />\nrarely done.<br />\nIn cases where the office has<br />\nreason to question the information provided, it asks for substantiating information, but<br />\nusually, \"We adjust need based<br />\n<br />\non actual IRS information...and<br />\ndon't make a big deal,\" says<br />\nGray, who estimates that the<br />\nHopkins Financial Aid Office<br />\nmakes changes in 50 percent of<br />\nthe applications it receives.<br />\nSo, if the student knows<br />\nhow to play \"the numbers<br />\ngame\" against the system and<br />\nkeeps the misinformation consistent with the Income Tax Form,<br />\nchances are that the violator will<br />\nnot be caught and,if caught, will<br />\nnot be penalized.<br />\n<br />\nStudentsAttend Rally<br />\nAgainstKlanIn Preston<br />\nPreston, Maryland, a small and the Klan and Nazis who spoke<br />\nCaroline County community at the forum, also helped organlocated among towns with ize the caravan.

Later,<br />\nAnna tells Ms. Vogler the erotic story of<br />\nlying nude on a beach with another<br />\nwomen, meeting two boys, and seducing<br />\nthem. Anna feels guilty because she was<br />\nengaged at the time. She also feels guilt<br />\nabout the abortion she was forced to have<br />\nas a result. At this point we wonder if Ms.<br />\nVogler isn't treating Anna rather than the<br />\nreverse. Anna's control is further thrown<br />\ninto doubt when she reads Ms. Vogler's<br />\nletter home. The letter implies that Ms.<br />\nVogler is pretending to be mute and<br />\nenjoys studying Anna's character. The<br />\nhint makes Anna visibly upset.<br />\nBut as the movie progresses, we<br />\nwonder if Anna isn't merely pretending<br />\nthat she needs Ms. Vogler as a friend and<br />\npsychological crutch. Perhaps this is all<br />\npart of the treatment, an attempt to<br />\nprovoke a verbal reaction from Ms.<br />\nVogler. The story of Anna's illicit love<br />\naffair at the beach, and the abortion,<br />\nturns out to be strikingly similar to<br />\nevents in Ms. Vogler's past. Perhaps the<br />\nstory was made up \u2014 an attempt to force<br />\nMs. Vogler to confront her problems. But<br />\nperhaps the story is true.<br />\nAppearance and reality, the actress and her character, are inseparably<br />\nlinked. As part of the treatment, Anna<br />\nand another (male) doctor act out scenes<br />\nfrom Ms. Vogler's life. Here Anna seems<br />\nin control, yet we find her plagued with<br />\nguilt about playing these roles. Eventually<br />\nAnna can't seem to distinguish herself<br />\nfrom her character and patient, Ms.<br />\n<br />\nguitar which has just about the most<br />\noffensive sound of any musical instrument yet invented.<br />\nThe worst songs here are those<br />\nwhining ballads of domestic strife that<br />\nform the backbone of country music.<br />\n\"Brown to Blue\" is a soapy tune about a<br />\ndivorce trial, with mind-numbing lyrics<br />\nlike \"I couldn't stop my tears from fallin'<br />\non the courtroom floor\"; \"A Good Year<br />\nfor the Roses\" uses all the stock props of<br />\nthat infamous \"you done me wrong\"<br />\ngenre of C&W songwriting:<br />\nlipstick<br />\ntraces, empty coffee cups, and unmade<br />\nbeds; \"Too Far Gone,\" written by<br />\nSherrill, is rendered wimpy and banal by<br />\nthe string arrangement, despite an interesting melody. It's all a bunch of hossshit, basically.<br />\nMost of the rest of the record is<br />\nmerely passable \u2014 intriguing compositions clubbed into mediocrity by obnoxious orchestrations. There are some<br />\nnice melodic hooks in the lilting \"Sweet<br />\nDreams\"; \"Success,\" while trite, is still<br />\ntoe-tapping; \"I'm Your Toy (Hot Burrito<br />\nNo. I),\" a dirge-like love song, puts<br />\nCostello's emotional voice to good use;<br />\n\"Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down\" is<br />\nrockabilly at its most bearable; \"Sittin'<br />\nand Thinkin\" and \"Color of the Blues\"<br />\nare pleasant at best, and the former is<br />\nredeemed by a few good lines, such as<br />\n\"When I'm drinkin', I ain't nobody's<br />\nfriend.\"<br />\nThere are only three remarkable<br />\nsongs on the album. The rock-and-roll<br />\nfeel of Hank Williams' \"Why Don't You<br />\nLove Me (Like You Used to Do)\" is<br />\nanchored by rapid-fire rhythm work from<br />\ndrummer Pete Thomas and bassist Bruce<br />\nThomas. \"How Much I Lied\" is a beautiful ballad, the only one not ruined by<br />\nsoaring violins or plastic harmonies.<br />\n\"Honey Hush,\" the best song on Almost<br />\nBlue, is a classic R&B number which<br />\nsports some nice piano-pounding by Steve<br />\nNeive and a line which Elvis probably<br />\nwishes he'd written himself: \"Don't<br />\nmake me nervous, I'm holding a baseball<br />\n<br />\n77<br />\n<br />\nbat.\" \"Honey Hush\" also gets my vote<br />\nfor the best use of the phrase \"yacketyyak\" in a popular song.<br />\nGiven Costello's enigmatic nature,<br />\nit's tempting to wonder if he might not<br />\nbe pulling our legs with all this whitetrash stuff. The question with Elvis has<br />\nalways been \"Can we take him seriously?\" Sadly, I think the answer is yes this<br />\ntime.<br />\nHe's obviously indulging his<br />\naffinity for country music with this<br />\nalbum, but the material for the most part<br />\nlacks the hard edge that gave life to his<br />\nown Nashville-influenced songs, namely<br />\n\"Different Finger,\" \"Stranger in the<br />\nHouse,\" and \"Motel Matches.\" If the<br />\nword \"blue\" is a candidate for the oldest<br />\ncliche in country music, then Almost Blue<br />\nis almost totally \"blue.\"<br />\nThe only<br />\ningredient in these songs that isn't in<br />\nsome way a C&W cliche is Costello's<br />\ndistinctive voice. If it weren't for that,it<br />\nwould be all too easy to confuse Almost<br />\nBlue with the latest Slim Whitman LP.<br />\n<br />\nLiv Ullmann as Ms. Vogler watches monks burning on boob-tube.<br />\nVogler. The two women begin to look various points along the way, once by<br />\nand dress more and more alike. The making the film seem as if it has been<br />\nfusion of appearance and reality, of the ripped up and gotten jammed in the<br />\nactress and her character, and the equal- machine, when in fact it's probably<br />\nity of their power relationship, are running smoothly. Another time he<br />\ncompleted in an amazing close-up of a intentionally shoots the film out of focus,<br />\nhead, half Anna's, half Ms. Vogler's. and at a third point we hear Ingmar<br />\nFittingly, for a film so self- Bergman explaining the action.<br />\nconscious of its own medium, the opening image is a shot of the front of a movie<br />\nBoth actresses are powerful, esprojector, as if the projector were shining pecially Liv Ullmann, who conveys her<br />\ninto a mirror. Just as the characters entire character without uttering a single<br />\nreflect on each other and are mirror spoken line. The semi-erotic friendship<br />\nimages of each other, the film reflects between these two women is passionate<br />\nback on itself. Bergman reminds the and touching. The film is a definite must<br />\nviewer that the film is just a film at for any cineaste.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 16 / NOVEMBER 13,1981<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nK<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nT-THE<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nXX' K<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\n.X<br />\n<br />\nK<br />\n<br />\nMr<br />\n<br />\n.W<br />\n<br />\nK<br />\n<br />\n11.<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\nK<br />\n<br />\nK<br />\n<br />\nK<br />\n<br />\nK<br />\n<br />\nK<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX'M<br />\n<br />\nThe Senior Class Film Series Presents...<br />\n<br />\nOFFICE OF THE CHAPLAIN<br />\nANNOUNCES A<br />\n<br />\n-1A-FSAVO,<br />\n<br />\n01<br />\n<br />\n00<br />\n<br />\nOG\u2022AA<br />\nNVik<br />\n(i+ OLO<br />\n\u2018-\u2018)S-VVA,<br />\n<br />\n111<br />\n<br />\nNssi<br />\np.,NA<br />\n<br />\n00<br />\n<br />\n1111<br />\n<br />\nstall\\<br />\nvccoetveevw2Aev,c6g<br />\n<br />\nozw<br />\n<br />\n08?)<br />\n<br />\nMEM INN<br />\n<br />\nIMM<br />\n<br />\ninn<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nNMI<br />\n<br />\nalai._<br />\n<br />\nr!)<br />\n<br />\n)<br />\nir<br />\n.<br />\nal=<br />\n<br />\n(AS LOW AS 50C)\u2014PLUS<br />\n\u2022 SPECIAL PRIZES AND GIVEAWAYS<br />\n\u2022<br />\nFor the benefit of the<br />\nI<br />\nJohns Hopkins Tutorial Project<br />\nI<br />\n11\u202211 NMI MN<br />\n<br />\nONO EMI<br />\n<br />\nIMEM<br />\n<br />\nNM<br />\n<br />\nMN<br />\n<br />\nMEI 1\u2022110 OEM<br />\n<br />\nNM<br />\n<br />\nFRIDAY, NOV13, 11:00 AM to 8:00 PMI<br />\nGlass Pavilion,Johns Hopkins University<br />\nHomewood Campus<br />\nShowtimes 7, 9 and 11 PM.<br />\n11/13 & 14<br />\nFriday & Saturday<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\nJohns Hopkins University<br />\n<br />\nC.ontributlons of recordings and equipment may be donated up to the time of<br />\nthe sale.

Such books<br />\nwhich have eventually become best sellers<br />\ninclude James Watson's Double Helix and<br />\nCharles Darwin's Origin of Species.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins Professor Gary<br />\nPosner isn't a bestselling author, he has<br />\npublished a book, An Introduction to<br />\nSynthesis Using Organocopper Reagants.<br />\nTwo thousand copies have been printed,<br />\nand 1500 have been sold.<br />\nBut Professor Posner, who received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from<br />\nHarvard University in 1968, prefers to<br />\npublish research papers. \"Books are a<br />\npain in the ass to write,\" commented<br />\nPosner. \"If I write papers then I receive<br />\ninvitations to give talks and to attend<br />\ninternational meetings.\" Thus far, 60 of<br />\nhis papers have been published, but<br />\nbefore they are sent away for approval,<br />\nPosner must complete a tedious and<br />\ncostly process.<br />\nThe first step is to get an idea for<br />\na project. \"If I recognize a new method,\"<br />\nnoted Posner,\"I look to see if I can apply<br />\nit to other chemicals such as a drug or a<br />\npharmaceutical. Also, if I'm interested in<br />\na certain class of molecules, I look at that<br />\nclass and see how I can prepare them in a<br />\nnew way. Both of these methods are<br />\nlogical.\" He adds, \"When I read journal<br />\narticles, I sometimes get insight into<br />\nbringing together things that are going<br />\non.<br />\nAfter' deciding upon a research<br />\ntopic, Posner goes to the library and \"gets<br />\na feeling of what has been done.\" He<br />\nwrites up a proposal, usually between 20<br />\nand 50 pages long, that lists \"the goals,<br />\nsignificance and considered possibilities<br />\nof the research, and also a literature<br />\nsummary which includes references to<br />\nback up the proposal.:'<br />\nThe proposal is then sent to<br />\n<br />\norganizations which are usually government-affiliated, such as the National<br />\nInstitutes of Health (NIH) and the<br />\nDepartment of Defense. \"There's virtually no private industry support. Only five<br />\npercent of my research has been funded<br />\nby pharmaceutical companies or just by<br />\nscrounging around for money,\" noted<br />\nPosner.<br />\nEven with the government backing, fewer proposals are being supported.<br />\n\"When I send in an application for a<br />\nproject, it's ranked and depending on<br />\nhow much money the institution has at<br />\nthat time, a certain number of proposals<br />\nare chosen,\" said Posner.. \"Today, even<br />\nsome of the high-ranking' ones are being<br />\nturned down with all the budget cuts.<br />\nReagan may do us in.\"<br />\nAfter the submission of the<br />\nproposal, a period of six months to a year<br />\nmay pass which may cause \"a project to<br />\ngo stale.\" But Posner hasn't had that<br />\nhappen to many of his projects. And<br />\npresently he is working on four different<br />\nresearch topics.<br />\nFor three years, Posner and his lab<br />\ngroup, which includes four graduate<br />\nstudents and three post-doctorals, has<br />\nbeen developing new ways of preparing<br />\nknown steroids which are organic compounds of thirty or more carbons. This<br />\nprocess is called \"new synthetic methodology.\" \"New procedures are being<br />\ndeveloped to produce physiologically<br />\nactive contraceptives,\" explained Posner.<br />\nIn order to prepare new drugs,<br />\nPosner synthesizes compounds called<br />\nanalogs which structurally resemble steroids. \"Modifications are then made to<br />\nimprove the analogs. The modified<br />\nsteroids are then sent away to pharmaceutical companies to be checked,\" said<br />\nPosner.<br />\nAnother goal listed by Posner in<br />\nhis research proposal was to reduce the<br />\nnumber of steps in the synthesis of<br />\nsteroids. \"In the 1950s it took sixty<br />\nsteps. In the last ten years it got down<br />\nto five,\" noted Posner. \"Now we've<br />\n<br />\nreduced it to one step.\" This aspect of<br />\nthe research took a year.<br />\nAlthough Posner deals mostly<br />\nwith his lab group, he also has given<br />\nresearch projects to undergraduates.<br />\n\"Two of these have blossomed into major<br />\nprojects,\" added Posner.<br />\nIn 1970, while an undergraduate<br />\nwas dealing with reactions on aluminum<br />\noxide surfaces, Posner noticed something<br />\nodd about one of the reactions and is still<br />\nattempting to prove that the reactions on<br />\naluminum oxide may mimic what is<br />\nthought to be the critical cancer step in<br />\nthe body, alkylation, where a carcinogen<br />\nlinks to the DNA. The aluminum oxide<br />\ntherefore might act as a template just as<br />\nDNA acts as a template in the cancer<br />\nprocess.<br />\nPosner is also participating in a<br />\nNIH-sponsored program project on cancer<br />\nalong with five other professors. Since<br />\nobtaining a grant a year and a half ago,<br />\nthe group has been trying to discover<br />\n\"the molecular basis for effects of environmental pollutants.\" Within carcinogenic pollutants such as burning charcoal,<br />\nheated asphalt and smoke is polycyclic<br />\naromatic hydrocarbons(PAH).<br />\n\"What we want to know is how<br />\nPAH is metabolized in the body,\" said<br />\nPosner. \"So Professor Selliger of the<br />\nBiology Department and myself are<br />\nmaking analogs to confirm what is going<br />\non, to explore the metabolism. Rats are<br />\nused to show how PAH is broken down,<br />\nbut we want to show the molecular<br />\npathway. Therefore, we hypothesize what<br />\nthe intermediate is and make it (the<br />\nanalog). And if it coincides with the<br />\nprediction that we had made, that it is<br />\ndientiluninescent, then it is what we want.<br />\nJust this past week, we have synthesized a<br />\ncompound that has exhibited chemilumiescent properties.\"<br />\nOnce the intermediate is found<br />\nand the properties are the same as the<br />\npredictions, it will be fed to rats and<br />\nchemically reacted with DNA. Professor<br />\nMoudrianakis is handling this aspect<br />\n<br />\nDr. Posner<br />\nof the research, to determine if the<br />\nintermediate will damage the DNA.<br />\n\"Cancer is the process whereby the DNA<br />\nis disrupted by carcinogens,\" added<br />\nPosner.<br />\nProfessor Posner is also dealing<br />\nwith the detoxification of toxic substances.(A year and a half ago the U.S.<br />\nArmy granted a contract to him because<br />\nPosner had noticed that nerve gas was<br />\namong these toxic substances.) Though<br />\nnerve gas isn't used in Posner's lab,<br />\nsimulants which are structurally similar<br />\nare substituted for the toxic substances.<br />\nPosner commented, \"We're working out<br />\nthe procedure on simulants in order to<br />\ndetoxify substances. But I thought<br />\nthe Army would be interested because of<br />\nthe protection that we may need against<br />\npossible Russian chemical warfare.\"<br />\nWhen, and if, Professor Posner<br />\ncompletes his research on steroids,<br />\ncancer, toxic substances, et. al., he'll<br />\npublish his findings in scientific journals<br />\nin order to help other scientists. \"They<br />\nwant to know details concerning the<br />\ntechnique as soon as the paper is published,\" commented Posner.<br />\nWhen asked what he thought of<br />\nworking for JHU,Posner replied,\"I enjoy<br />\nteaching. I also enjoy the freedom of not<br />\nhaving a boss so I can pursue my own<br />\nideas.\"<br />\nAnd pursuing his own ideas is<br />\nwhat Professor Posner does best.<br />\n<br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nALWAYS BY SUZANNE CONKLIN<br />\nFILM<br />\nSunday<br />\nGone With the Wind is showing at the<br />\nCharles, 1711 N.

One of<br />\nthe dozen is Baltimore's own<br />\nBlast, which opens its season<br />\nagainst the Philadelphia Fever at<br />\n1:35 p.m.(WFBR).<br />\nA capacity crowd is expected at the Civic Center. According to general manager Mitch<br />\nBurke, nearly 8,000 tickets have<br />\nbeen distributed to the large<br />\nnumber of groups in the Baltimore soccer community, and<br />\nthat figure also includes 1300<br />\nBlast season ticket holders. But<br />\nBurke is quick to reassure fans<br />\nthere are several thousand good<br />\nseats still available.<br />\n\"Because opening night was<br />\nsold out last season, the natural<br />\ntendency is to predict a sellout<br />\nagain this year,\" Burke explained. \"Ticket sales have been<br />\ngreat, and it's easy to become<br />\nexcited and anticipate a full<br />\nhouse. But we don't want to be<br />\npremature. With the increased<br />\ncapacity in the Civic Center this<br />\nyear (from 10,400 to 11,100)<br />\nand the latest report from the<br />\nticket office, those fans who<br />\nhaven't purchased their tickets<br />\nfor opening night won't be left<br />\nout in the cold \u2014 yet.\"<br />\nThat is, not being left out in<br />\nthe cold this season, because last<br />\nyear, they were only left out<br />\nin the cold when the season<br />\ncame to an end. Under the<br />\nleadership of coach Kenny Cooper, the newly christened Blast<br />\nfinished the regular season with<br />\na 21-19 record, second in the<br />\nAtlantic Division and runner-up<br />\nto the New York Arrows. After<br />\ndisposing of the Cleveland Force<br />\nin a best-of-three quarterfinal<br />\nplayoff series, the Blast advanced to the MISL semifinal.<br />\n<br />\n-441('44k<br />\n<br />\n-wok<br />\n<br />\ngame in St. Louis. In the saddest<br />\nmoment of Cooper's coaching<br />\ncareer, the Blast was again<br />\ndefeated by its nemesis, the<br />\nArrows, 10-1.<br />\n\"Last season,\" commented<br />\nCooper, \"I felt the Baltimore<br />\n<br />\nBlast had to accomplish three<br />\nthings to be successful: 1)field a<br />\nwinning team; 2) put people in<br />\nthe seats; and 3) bring national<br />\nrecognition to Baltimore by<br />\nreaching the MISL championship<br />\nfinal in St. Louis.<br />\n\"We accomplished two of<br />\nthese goals, but our performance<br />\nin the MISL semifinal game in<br />\nSt. Louis was not a true indication of the Baltimore Blast.

An<br />\nalumnus of SAIS, Blitzer, who<br />\nhas been studying the Middle<br />\nEast for a book on U.S.-Israeli<br />\nrelations, feels that Sadat's assassination will not change Egypt's<br />\nrelations with Israel considerably.<br /><br />\nEgypt's peace with Israel<br />\nhas been achieved after lengthy<br />\nnegotiations and compromises,<br />\nBlitzer said. Blitzer feels that<br />\nnew President Hosni Mubarak is<br />\nnot willing to sacrifice that<br />\npeace. \"Mubarak is not going to<br />\nbe a transitory leader,\" he said.<br />\n\"I believe the peace will continue to exist, even with Sadat's<br />\nassassination.\"<br />\nBlitzer expressed confidence<br />\nin Mubarak. He sees Mubarak as<br /><br />\na strong political force in his<br />\ncountry \u2014 a man who as VicePresident moved up strategically<br />\nto the position where he became<br />\nSadat's heir apparent. Under<br />\nMubarak, Blitzer said, Egypt will<br />\nmove toward better relations<br />\nwith other Arab nations. Egypt's<br />\nisolation from neighboring Arab<br />\ncountries under Sadat was in<br />\npart due to personal differences<br />\nbetween Sadat and the leaders of<br />\nthose nations, according to<br />\nBlitzer.<br /><br />\nCivic Association Releases Report<br />\nOn Charles Street Safety Hazards<br />\ncont. from p. I<br />\nbound. Because the street carries<br />\nmostly northbound traffic, the<br />\npedestrian instinctively pays<br />\nmost attention to the northbound lanes. As a result, there is<br />\na tendency to neglect the<br />\nsouthbound lanes, the report<br />\nstates.<br />\nIn order to substantiate its<br />\nclaim of the danger posed by the<br />\ncenter southbound lane, the report cites accident figures for<br />\nthe period between 1975 and<br />\n1979. In that period, there were<br />\n11 accidents involving pedestrians in the southbound lane and<br />\njust one in the three northbound<br />\nlanes.<br />\nTo alleviate these problems,<br />\nthe report recommends three<br />\npossible solutions., the installation of rumble strips in the<br />\ncenter southbound lane, the conversion of the center roadway<br />\ninto two southbound and two<br />\nnorthbound lanes, or the separation of the center southbound<br />\nlane and northbound lanes by a<br />\nmedian strip.<br />\nThe installation of rumble<br />\nstrips in the center southbound<br />\nlane would, the report states,<br />\nalert pedestrians to the approach<br />\nof vehicles. A metal grating strip<br />\nwould be preferable to the<br />\nconventional rumble strip, the<br />\ncommittee feels, because the<br />\nnoise produced when a vehicle's<br />\ntires hit the grating is more<br />\naudible. The report proposes<br />\ninstalling the strips a short<br />\ndistance before each intersection.<br />\nThe second option of con-<br /><br />\nverting the main roadway into<br />\ntwo lanes each way would<br />\neliminate the deception of the<br />\npresent arrangement, the report<br />\nsays. Although this plan would<br />\ncause an increase in congestion<br />\nin the northbound lanes, the<br />\ncommittee's observations show<br />\nthat only 23 percent of the<br />\nnorthbound traffic uses the lane<br />\nthat would be converted. The<br />\ncommittee feels that after a<br />\nperiod of adjustment, commuters will find alternative<br />\nroutes and that the final increase<br />\nin congestion on Charles Street<br />\nwill be minimal.<br />\nThe third alternative would<br />\nbe to construct a median between the north and southbound<br />\nlanes. This would serve to<br />\nremind pedestrians of the change<br />\nof traffic direction as well as<br />\nproviding the pedestrian with a<br />\nsafe place to stand between<br />\nopposing lanes of traffic. However, since the lanes of Charles<br />\nStreet are only ten feet wide,<br />\nthis option would entail the<br />\nelimination of one of the northbound lanes. As with the second<br />\nalternative, this would increase<br />\ncongestion in the remaining<br />\nlanes, but the committee feels<br />\nthat this problem is offset by the<br />\nincreased safety the median will<br />\nprovide.<br />\nWhile concentrating on<br />\nthese three options, the report<br />\nalso suggests that traffic and<br />\npedestrian crossing lines be more<br />\nclearly marked and that a<br />\npedestrian crossing signal be<br />\ninstalled at 33rd Street. The<br />\ncommittee also .suggests that<br /><br />\nwhat it terms \"a considerable<br />\namount of speeding\" could<br />\nbe alleviated by stricter enforcement of the speed limit by<br />\npolice.<br />\nThe fate of the proposed<br />\nchanges is now in the hands of<br />\nthe Mayor, the City Council, and<br />\nthe Department of Transit and<br />\nTraffic.<br /><br />\nBlitzer spoke at length<br />\nabout U.S.-Israeli relations, giving a historical perspective. He<br />\ndenied the contention of several<br />\nMiddle East observers that the<br />\n\"honeymoon\" between Israel<br />\nand Washington is over because<br />\nof the sale of the AWACS to<br />\nSaudi Arabia. Noting that the<br />\nfirst year of the presidency has<br />\nhistorically been a bad one for<br />\nU.S.-Israeli relations, Blitzer<br />\nmaintained that the friendship<br />\nbetween the two nations is<br />\nresilient enough to survive<br />\nclashes because maintaining<br />\ngood relations is in the best<br />\ninterests of both.<br />\nThe U.S. cannot ignore<br />\nIsrael as a military strength in<br />\nthe Middle East, and a strategically important country, Blitzer<br />\nadded. As for Israel, the U.S.,<br />\nwith the largest population of<br />\nJewish people, has to be taken<br />\ninto consideration before making a policy decision. \"Every<br />\nIsraeli government is going to<br />\nhave to temper its activities to<br />\ntake the U.S. into consideration,\" he said.<br /><br />\nStudent members will be<br />\nchosen by the Student Council,<br />\nguided by recommendations to<br />\nbe made by SHAC in conjunction with the Student Council<br />\non<br />\nCommittees<br />\nCommittee<br />\n(COC). These recommendations<br />\nwill be forwarded on the basis of<br />\ninterviews of prospective members conducted by the COC,<br />\nwith two members of SHAC<br />\nattending the interviews in an<br />\nadvisory capacity.<br />\nSHAC duties, as envisioned<br />\nby its constitution as<br />\nratified<br />\nNov.4<br />\nby the Council, will<br />\nconsist of acting on the Council's behalf as a liaison between<br />\nthe student body and the staff<br />\nand administration of the Health<br />\nCenter, and making recommendations, in conjunction with the<br />\nNurse Director of the Health<br />\nServices, \"concerning new programs or modifications of existing programs.\"<br />\nThe constitution of SHAC,<br />\nas drawn up and submitted by<br />\npresent co-chairpersons Donna<br />\nKarnoutsos and Alan Marco,<br />\nestablished the group as an<br />\nindependent subcommittee with<br />\na permanent Council standing, a<br />\nprovision deemed necessary in<br />\nlight of the continuing nature of<br />\nstudent interest in the health<br />\nservices available at Hopkins.<br />\nSuch standing would allow the<br />\ncommittee to select its own<br />\nchairman, instead of Council<br />\nmembers.<br />\nAccording to SC president<br />\nChuck Peifer, such an exemption<br />\nfor SHAC is advisable in light of<br />\nthe special duties and level of<br />\nexpertise required of the chairman.<br />\nHowever, such standing for<br />\nSHAC as an independent subcommittee was ruled unconstitutional. To avoid this problem,<br />\nthe Council decided to grant ad<br />\nhoc status to SHAC, thereby<br />\nreleasing it from the constitutional constraint that all permanent Council committees<br />\nhave their chairmen selected<br />\nby Council members themselves.<br /><br />\nAcademic Council To Consider<br />\nChanges In Ethics Constitution<br />\nBY PETER YAROSCHUK<br />\nThe Student Council met<br />\nwith the Undergraduate Academic Ethics Board Oct. 21 to<br />\ndraft some proposals aimed at<br />\nimproving the Ethics Board<br />\nConstitution.<br />\nThe present constitution,<br />\nthough providing the student<br />\nwith a mechanism for disputing<br />\nand fighting a cheating charge,<br />\nallegedly fails to inform the<br />\nstudent of his other rights,<br />\nallows many cases to go unexamined by the Board (often to the<br />\nstudent's detriment), and gives<br />\nthe student few alternatives.<br />\nUnder the new amendments, when a student is caught<br />\ncheating the professor must<br />\nconfront the student.

The Financial<br />\nAid Office \"cannot require the<br />\nnoncustodial parent to provide<br />\nsupport that isn't forthcoming,\"<br />\nshe explained. Neither Roberts<br />\nnor Gray denied that the above<br />\ncases could have occurred but<br />\nthey said such things are less<br />\nlikely to happen now that the<br />\noffice has begun to ask for<br />\nincome tax statements from<br />\nboth parents and to require<br />\nassistance from the noncustodial<br />\nparent as well.<br />\nDeclaring financial independence is yet another way that<br />\nstudents can receive federal aid<br />\nthat they would not be entitled<br />\nto otherwise. In the past, Hopkins students who declared independence from parental support were given \"full budget<br />\nconsideration\" and were eligible<br />\nto a separate reserve of federal<br />\nfunds. This policy has been<br />\nmodified at Hopkins in part<br />\nbecause, according to Gray, it<br />\nencouraged students, many of<br />\nwhom came from wealthy families, to \"become independent so<br />\nthat they'd be eligible for aid.\"<br />\nNow Hopkins interviews<br />\neach student who declares financial independence to ascertain<br />\nhis or her status, but, as Gray<br />\npointed out, Hopkins is more<br />\ncareful than a great number of<br />\nother schools in its allocation of<br />\naid because institutional funds<br />\nare also involved. At many<br />\ncolleges where federal aid is the<br />\nbulk or even all of the financial<br /><br />\ncont.from p. I<br />\nably cheat the system and get<br />\naway with it.<br />\napHowever, students<br />\nproached on the subject generally place the estimate considerably higher. \"Oh,almost everyone<br />\ncheats on the FAF,\" claimed<br />\none Hopkins student. One<br />\nreason that students feel cheating on the FAF is prevalent is<br />\nthat many of them know fellow<br />\nstudents who have provided false<br />\ninformation and receive additional aid as a result. \"I know a<br />\ngirl who writes that she's a New<br />\nYork resident even though she<br />\nlives in Maryland,\" said one<br />\njunior. \"New York supposedly<br />\nhas more money so she gets aid<br />\nthat she wouldn't as a Maryland<br />\nresident. She seems pretty proud<br />\nof it too.\"<br />\nAnother way in which some<br />\nstudents cheat is by including<br />\nthe income of only one of their<br />\nparents on the FAF although<br />\nboth parents are working. This is<br />\nmore frequently the case with<br />\nstudents whose parents are divorced. In these cases, the<br />\nfederal government is often told<br />\nthat the parent with the lower<br />\nincome is supporting the student<br />\nwhen in fact both arents may<br />\nbe sharing the expi c. Through<br />\nthird-party source the Newsal cases in<br />\nLetter learned of s<br />\nwhich a student vvi ise parents<br />\nare divorced receives financial<br />\naid but also is supprted financially by both parents while the<br />\nsupport of only one parent is<br />\nreported.<br />\nAccording to Financial Aid<br /><br />\naid furnished, financial aid offices fail to check the status of<br />\neach individual before parcelling<br />\nout federal funds, making it<br />\neasier for students to receive<br />\nfederal aid, whether or not they<br />\nare legitimately independent.<br />\nThe number of siblings in<br />\ncollege is another factor that<br />\ndetermines a student's financial<br />\nneed. Theoretically, it is difficult<br />\nto cheat on the number of<br />\nbrothers and sisters one has<br />\nbecause the information provided has to be consistent with<br />\nvarious forms that contain their<br />\nnames and ages. One student<br />\ninformed the News-Letter, however, that the student's parents<br />\nclaim an additional dependent<br />\non the FAF. The student feels<br />\ncertain that the Financial Aid<br />\nOffice will not question this<br />\npiece of information because it<br />\nis consistent with the income tax<br />\nforms.<br />\nCheating on the FAF has<br />\nbeen compared to cheating on<br />\nFederal Income Tax forms. One<br />\nmajor difference, however, is<br />\nthat there is a federal agency,<br />\nthe IRS,that investigates income<br />\ntax fraud whereas the FAF is<br />\nreviewed only by a college<br />\nfinancial aid office that is aimed<br />\nat helping students meet educational needs, not at policing<br />\nfraud. The result is that few<br />\npeople are caught falsifying<br />\ninformation on the FAF.<br />\nThis is not to say that<br />\ncollege financial aid offices are<br />\nnot doing their job. For the<br />\nmost part, administrators are<br />\naware of the problem.

Unusually prolific by rock's standards, he has<br />\nreleased six albums within the past four<br />\nyears, all of them of considerable quality,<br />\nand not a single one exactly like any of<br />\nthe others in style. With the appearance<br />\nof Almost Blue, Costello's seventh and<br />\nmost quirky record, the mystery gets<br />\nmore complicated. It's a drastic departure: the material consists entire! of<br />\n\u2018,1<br /><br />\nNew Elvis: a downer on t e arm<br /><br />\ncountry and western songs, none of<br />\nwhich Costello wrote; and Nick Lowe,<br />\nwhose power-pop production gave so<br />\nmuch resonance to Costello classics like<br />\nMy Aim Is True and Armed Forces, is<br />\nnowhere to be found. Almost Blue was<br />\nrecorded, in Nashville, by Billy Sherrill, a<br />\nveteran C&amp;W producer. Loyal Elvis fans,<br />\nbeware.<br />\nThis record bugs the hell out of<br />\nme. It could have been a good album,if<br />\nthe songs had been more wisely chosen<br />\nand the arrangements more tastefully<br />\ndone. But as it stands we have 12 fair-topoor ditties about marital infidelity,<br />\nfailed relationships, and boozy lamentation, most of them drenched in the<br />\nsoppiest orchestrations this side of the<br />\nGrand Ole Opry. All you gotta tell me<br />\nnow is why, why, why, why.<br />\nThe biggest mistake was the<br />\ndecision to add further instrumentation<br />\nto the tracks beyond the contributions of<br />\nCostello's ever-improving backup band,<br />\nthe Attractions. There's not a song in the<br />\nbunch that isn't soaked in strings, and the<br />\nvocal harmonies provided by a group<br />\nof singers credited only as Nashville<br />\nEdition sound irritatingly like Muzak<br />\nversions of real human voices.

The selections<br />\nincluded The End of the Endless Short<br />\nStory, The End of the Endless Short<br />\nStory Continued, Divide, and What's<br />\nWatts.<br />\nThe greater part of Sukenick's<br />\nclose-to-50-member audience seemed to<br />\nbe interested and entertained, if slightly<br />\nconfused by the pieces. The humor of the<br />\nwordplay and certain story elements<br />\nmade the reading enjoyable, but even<br />\nthough the humor was double-edged, it<br />\ntoo effectively masked many of the ideas<br />\nin Sukenick's writing. One listener<br />\ncommented, \"I think I'd have to read it<br />\n(the selections) to enjoy it better, although I really enjoyed the language. The<br />\nmeaning of the story really only came<br />\nacross in one of them.\"<br />\nSukenick's work is better read<br />\nthan listened to, although it is amusing to.<br />\nhear stories about Jewish cats who only<br />\neat kosher nip and comments like \"The<br />\nbest cure for paranoia is schizophrenia\"<br />\nand \"The Americans are after me.\" Such<br />\na reading wears thin after a time and one<br />\nleaves with a feeling of frustration at<br />\nhaving gotten all the jokes, but little of<br />\nthe meaning.<br /><br />\nfree to have physical contact without<br />\narousing suspicion.<br />\nThe only thing that we perceive as<br />\nbeing odd about Ms. Vogler is that she<br />\nnever speaks. Neither the audience nor<br />\nSister Anna are sure whether this silence<br />\nis an act of will or a sign of lunacy.<br />\nThe fun of film lies in the ambiguity of the power relationship between<br />\nthese two characters. We are constantly<br />\nwondering who's in control. Of course<br />\nthe Dr. should be in control of her<br />\npatient, but this control is questioned<br />\neven from the outset. Sister Anna complains to the head of the hospital that this<br />\npatient may be too much for her. Later,<br />\nAnna tells Ms. Vogler the erotic story of<br />\nlying nude on a beach with another<br />\nwomen, meeting two boys, and seducing<br />\nthem. Anna feels guilty because she was<br />\nengaged at the time. She also feels guilt<br />\nabout the abortion she was forced to have<br />\nas a result. At this point we wonder if Ms.<br />\nVogler isn't treating Anna rather than the<br />\nreverse. Anna's control is further thrown<br />\ninto doubt when she reads Ms. Vogler's<br />\nletter home. The letter implies that Ms.<br />\nVogler is pretending to be mute and<br />\nenjoys studying Anna's character. The<br />\nhint makes Anna visibly upset.<br />\nBut as the movie progresses, we<br />\nwonder if Anna isn't merely pretending<br />\nthat she needs Ms. Vogler as a friend and<br />\npsychological crutch. Perhaps this is all<br />\npart of the treatment, an attempt to<br />\nprovoke a verbal reaction from Ms.<br />\nVogler. The story of Anna's illicit love<br />\naffair at the beach, and the abortion,<br />\nturns out to be strikingly similar to<br />\nevents in Ms. Vogler's past. Perhaps the<br />\nstory was made up \u2014 an attempt to force<br />\nMs. Vogler to confront her problems. But<br />\nperhaps the story is true.<br />\nAppearance and reality, the actress and her character, are inseparably<br />\nlinked. As part of the treatment, Anna<br />\nand another (male) doctor act out scenes<br />\nfrom Ms. Vogler's life. Here Anna seems<br />\nin control, yet we find her plagued with<br />\nguilt about playing these roles. Eventually<br />\nAnna can't seem to distinguish herself<br />\nfrom her character and patient, Ms.<br /><br />\nguitar which has just about the most<br />\noffensive sound of any musical instrument yet invented.<br />\nThe worst songs here are those<br />\nwhining ballads of domestic strife that<br />\nform the backbone of country music.<br />\n\"Brown to Blue\" is a soapy tune about a<br />\ndivorce trial, with mind-numbing lyrics<br />\nlike \"I couldn't stop my tears from fallin'<br />\non the courtroom floor\"; \"A Good Year<br />\nfor the Roses\" uses all the stock props of<br />\nthat infamous \"you done me wrong\"<br />\ngenre of C&amp;W songwriting:<br />\nlipstick<br />\ntraces, empty coffee cups, and unmade<br />\nbeds; \"Too Far Gone,\" written by<br />\nSherrill, is rendered wimpy and banal by<br />\nthe string arrangement, despite an interesting melody.

There are some<br />\nnice melodic hooks in the lilting \"Sweet<br />\nDreams\"; \"Success,\" while trite, is still<br />\ntoe-tapping; \"I'm Your Toy (Hot Burrito<br />\nNo. I),\" a dirge-like love song, puts<br />\nCostello's emotional voice to good use;<br />\n\"Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down\" is<br />\nrockabilly at its most bearable; \"Sittin'<br />\nand Thinkin\" and \"Color of the Blues\"<br />\nare pleasant at best, and the former is<br />\nredeemed by a few good lines, such as<br />\n\"When I'm drinkin', I ain't nobody's<br />\nfriend.\"<br />\nThere are only three remarkable<br />\nsongs on the album. The rock-and-roll<br />\nfeel of Hank Williams' \"Why Don't You<br />\nLove Me (Like You Used to Do)\" is<br />\nanchored by rapid-fire rhythm work from<br />\ndrummer Pete Thomas and bassist Bruce<br />\nThomas. \"How Much I Lied\" is a beautiful ballad, the only one not ruined by<br />\nsoaring violins or plastic harmonies.<br />\n\"Honey Hush,\" the best song on Almost<br />\nBlue, is a classic R&amp;B number which<br />\nsports some nice piano-pounding by Steve<br />\nNeive and a line which Elvis probably<br />\nwishes he'd written himself: \"Don't<br />\nmake me nervous, I'm holding a baseball<br /><br />\n77<br /><br />\nbat.\" \"Honey Hush\" also gets my vote<br />\nfor the best use of the phrase \"yacketyyak\" in a popular song.<br />\nGiven Costello's enigmatic nature,<br />\nit's tempting to wonder if he might not<br />\nbe pulling our legs with all this whitetrash stuff. The question with Elvis has<br />\nalways been \"Can we take him seriously?\" Sadly, I think the answer is yes this<br />\ntime.<br />\nHe's obviously indulging his<br />\naffinity for country music with this<br />\nalbum, but the material for the most part<br />\nlacks the hard edge that gave life to his<br />\nown Nashville-influenced songs, namely<br />\n\"Different Finger,\" \"Stranger in the<br />\nHouse,\" and \"Motel Matches.\" If the<br />\nword \"blue\" is a candidate for the oldest<br />\ncliche in country music, then Almost Blue<br />\nis almost totally \"blue.\"<br />\nThe only<br />\ningredient in these songs that isn't in<br />\nsome way a C&amp;W cliche is Costello's<br />\ndistinctive voice.

Such books<br />\nwhich have eventually become best sellers<br />\ninclude James Watson's Double Helix and<br />\nCharles Darwin's Origin of Species.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins Professor Gary<br />\nPosner isn't a bestselling author, he has<br />\npublished a book, An Introduction to<br />\nSynthesis Using Organocopper Reagants.<br />\nTwo thousand copies have been printed,<br />\nand 1500 have been sold.<br />\nBut Professor Posner, who received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from<br />\nHarvard University in 1968, prefers to<br />\npublish research papers. \"Books are a<br />\npain in the ass to write,\" commented<br />\nPosner. \"If I write papers then I receive<br />\ninvitations to give talks and to attend<br />\ninternational meetings.\" Thus far, 60 of<br />\nhis papers have been published, but<br />\nbefore they are sent away for approval,<br />\nPosner must complete a tedious and<br />\ncostly process.<br />\nThe first step is to get an idea for<br />\na project. \"If I recognize a new method,\"<br />\nnoted Posner,\"I look to see if I can apply<br />\nit to other chemicals such as a drug or a<br />\npharmaceutical. Also, if I'm interested in<br />\na certain class of molecules, I look at that<br />\nclass and see how I can prepare them in a<br />\nnew way. Both of these methods are<br />\nlogical.\" He adds, \"When I read journal<br />\narticles, I sometimes get insight into<br />\nbringing together things that are going<br />\non.<br />\nAfter' deciding upon a research<br />\ntopic, Posner goes to the library and \"gets<br />\na feeling of what has been done.\" He<br />\nwrites up a proposal, usually between 20<br />\nand 50 pages long, that lists \"the goals,<br />\nsignificance and considered possibilities<br />\nof the research, and also a literature<br />\nsummary which includes references to<br />\nback up the proposal.:'<br />\nThe proposal is then sent to<br /><br />\norganizations which are usually government-affiliated, such as the National<br />\nInstitutes of Health (NIH) and the<br />\nDepartment of Defense. \"There's virtually no private industry support. Only five<br />\npercent of my research has been funded<br />\nby pharmaceutical companies or just by<br />\nscrounging around for money,\" noted<br />\nPosner.<br />\nEven with the government backing, fewer proposals are being supported.<br />\n\"When I send in an application for a<br />\nproject, it's ranked and depending on<br />\nhow much money the institution has at<br />\nthat time, a certain number of proposals<br />\nare chosen,\" said Posner.. \"Today, even<br />\nsome of the high-ranking' ones are being<br />\nturned down with all the budget cuts.<br />\nReagan may do us in.\"<br />\nAfter the submission of the<br />\nproposal, a period of six months to a year<br />\nmay pass which may cause \"a project to<br />\ngo stale.\" But Posner hasn't had that<br />\nhappen to many of his projects. And<br />\npresently he is working on four different<br />\nresearch topics.<br />\nFor three years, Posner and his lab<br />\ngroup, which includes four graduate<br />\nstudents and three post-doctorals, has<br />\nbeen developing new ways of preparing<br />\nknown steroids which are organic compounds of thirty or more carbons. This<br />\nprocess is called \"new synthetic methodology.\" \"New procedures are being<br />\ndeveloped to produce physiologically<br />\nactive contraceptives,\" explained Posner.<br />\nIn order to prepare new drugs,<br />\nPosner synthesizes compounds called<br />\nanalogs which structurally resemble steroids. \"Modifications are then made to<br />\nimprove the analogs. The modified<br />\nsteroids are then sent away to pharmaceutical companies to be checked,\" said<br />\nPosner.<br />\nAnother goal listed by Posner in<br />\nhis research proposal was to reduce the<br />\nnumber of steps in the synthesis of<br />\nsteroids. \"In the 1950s it took sixty<br />\nsteps. In the last ten years it got down<br />\nto five,\" noted Posner. \"Now we've<br /><br />\nreduced it to one step.\" This aspect of<br />\nthe research took a year.<br />\nAlthough Posner deals mostly<br />\nwith his lab group, he also has given<br />\nresearch projects to undergraduates.<br />\n\"Two of these have blossomed into major<br />\nprojects,\" added Posner.<br />\nIn 1970, while an undergraduate<br />\nwas dealing with reactions on aluminum<br />\noxide surfaces, Posner noticed something<br />\nodd about one of the reactions and is still<br />\nattempting to prove that the reactions on<br />\naluminum oxide may mimic what is<br />\nthought to be the critical cancer step in<br />\nthe body, alkylation, where a carcinogen<br />\nlinks to the DNA. The aluminum oxide<br />\ntherefore might act as a template just as<br />\nDNA acts as a template in the cancer<br />\nprocess.<br />\nPosner is also participating in a<br />\nNIH-sponsored program project on cancer<br />\nalong with five other professors. Since<br />\nobtaining a grant a year and a half ago,<br />\nthe group has been trying to discover<br />\n\"the molecular basis for effects of environmental pollutants.\" Within carcinogenic pollutants such as burning charcoal,<br />\nheated asphalt and smoke is polycyclic<br />\naromatic hydrocarbons(PAH).<br />\n\"What we want to know is how<br />\nPAH is metabolized in the body,\" said<br />\nPosner. \"So Professor Selliger of the<br />\nBiology Department and myself are<br />\nmaking analogs to confirm what is going<br />\non, to explore the metabolism. Rats are<br />\nused to show how PAH is broken down,<br />\nbut we want to show the molecular<br />\npathway. Therefore, we hypothesize what<br />\nthe intermediate is and make it (the<br />\nanalog). And if it coincides with the<br />\nprediction that we had made, that it is<br />\ndientiluninescent, then it is what we want.<br />\nJust this past week, we have synthesized a<br />\ncompound that has exhibited chemilumiescent properties.\"<br />\nOnce the intermediate is found<br />\nand the properties are the same as the<br />\npredictions, it will be fed to rats and<br />\nchemically reacted with DNA. Professor<br />\nMoudrianakis is handling this aspect<br /><br />\nDr. Posner<br />\nof the research, to determine if the<br />\nintermediate will damage the DNA.<br />\n\"Cancer is the process whereby the DNA<br />\nis disrupted by carcinogens,\" added<br />\nPosner.<br />\nProfessor Posner is also dealing<br />\nwith the detoxification of toxic substances.(A year and a half ago the U.S.<br />\nArmy granted a contract to him because<br />\nPosner had noticed that nerve gas was<br />\namong these toxic substances.) Though<br />\nnerve gas isn't used in Posner's lab,<br />\nsimulants which are structurally similar<br />\nare substituted for the toxic substances.<br />\nPosner commented, \"We're working out<br />\nthe procedure on simulants in order to<br />\ndetoxify substances. But I thought<br />\nthe Army would be interested because of<br />\nthe protection that we may need against<br />\npossible Russian chemical warfare.\"<br />\nWhen, and if, Professor Posner<br />\ncompletes his research on steroids,<br />\ncancer, toxic substances, et. al., he'll<br />\npublish his findings in scientific journals<br />\nin order to help other scientists. \"They<br />\nwant to know details concerning the<br />\ntechnique as soon as the paper is published,\" commented Posner.<br />\nWhen asked what he thought of<br />\nworking for JHU,Posner replied,\"I enjoy<br />\nteaching. I also enjoy the freedom of not<br />\nhaving a boss so I can pursue my own<br />\nideas.\"<br />\nAnd pursuing his own ideas is<br />\nwhat Professor Posner does best.<br /><br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nALWAYS BY SUZANNE CONKLIN<br />\nFILM<br />\nSunday<br />\nGone With the Wind is showing at the<br />\nCharles, 1711 N.

One of<br />\nthe dozen is Baltimore's own<br />\nBlast, which opens its season<br />\nagainst the Philadelphia Fever at<br />\n1:35 p.m.(WFBR).<br />\nA capacity crowd is expected at the Civic Center. According to general manager Mitch<br />\nBurke, nearly 8,000 tickets have<br />\nbeen distributed to the large<br />\nnumber of groups in the Baltimore soccer community, and<br />\nthat figure also includes 1300<br />\nBlast season ticket holders. But<br />\nBurke is quick to reassure fans<br />\nthere are several thousand good<br />\nseats still available.<br />\n\"Because opening night was<br />\nsold out last season, the natural<br />\ntendency is to predict a sellout<br />\nagain this year,\" Burke explained. \"Ticket sales have been<br />\ngreat, and it's easy to become<br />\nexcited and anticipate a full<br />\nhouse.

Under the<br />\nleadership of coach Kenny Cooper, the newly christened Blast<br />\nfinished the regular season with<br />\na 21-19 record, second in the<br />\nAtlantic Division and runner-up<br />\nto the New York Arrows.

In the saddest<br />\nmoment of Cooper's coaching<br />\ncareer, the Blast was again<br />\ndefeated by its nemesis, the<br />\nArrows, 10-1.<br />\n\"Last season,\" commented<br />\nCooper, \"I felt the Baltimore<br /><br />\nBlast had to accomplish three<br />\nthings to be successful: 1)field a<br />\nwinning team; 2) put people in<br />\nthe seats; and 3) bring national<br />\nrecognition to Baltimore by<br />\nreaching the MISL championship<br />\nfinal in St. Louis.<br />\n\"We accomplished two of<br />\nthese goals, but our performance<br />\nin the MISL semifinal game in<br />\nSt. Louis was not a true indication of the Baltimore Blast.
