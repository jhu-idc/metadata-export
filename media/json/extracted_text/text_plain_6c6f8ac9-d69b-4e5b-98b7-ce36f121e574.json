From then until his<br />\nesignation, he has proven himself<br />\na jack of all trades.<br />\nBesides assisting Dr. Morrill<br />\nwith lacrosse through the end of<br />\nhe 1946 season, Mal has coached<br />\narsity football, basketball and<br />\noss-country and handled physical<br />\neducation classes in addition to<br />\neading up the athletic department.
