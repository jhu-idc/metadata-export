If<br />\nA DEADLY ART<br />\nwe down the Onondagas we will<br />\nplow through all the rest of the<br />\nA New York column conductor has recently drawn up a list<br />\nschedule, and carry the fame of<br />\nof the seven \"deadly arts.\" At the head of the list he places editorial writing. A deadly art he characterizes as \"one that is no fun<br />\nHopkins to a very high point. This<br />\nis a crucial game.<br />\nto be engaged in; one that gives the artist small fame, one that<br />\nmakes the artist feel 'suppose I do this extremely well, what then ?'\"<br />\nAll along the line\u2014\"from president down to coal-stoker,\" as<br />\nJohn Paul Bart would say\u2014there has been a general lamentation<br />\nat the decadence of editorial writing. Even our own campus<br />\nSkepticus bewails the fact that the editorials of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nare vapid and tiring. Another art has been lost, it is said. The<br />\nart of writing editorials has joined the art of illuminating manuscripts, of firing Wedgwood, of embalming mummies, and of a<br />\nthousand other delights of the good old days.<br />\nThe trouble is that the writer of editorials is an anachronism.<br />\nHe belongs back in the journalism of Addison and Steele. He is<br />\nbound by antiquated rules of style and of choice of subject. In a<br />\ntime when the \"personal note\" is all the rage the personality of the<br />\neditorial writer is lost by merging with the shadowy personality of<br />\nthe paper for which he writes. Now and then a William Allen<br />\nWhite rises to a position of influence by breaking every existing<br />\nrule of the dying \"art.\" But the average editor is never known by<br />\nthe public.<br />\nFew but devoted maiden ladies and the. staffs of rival papers<br />\nread the editorials. When the late Mr. Cobb died one or two newspaper men knew that one of the greatest editorial writers of America had died. The reading public were interested until they discovered that it was not Irvin S. Cobb nor Tyrus R. Cobb and then<br />\nthey promptly forgot all about the dead editor.<br />\nThe editorial is a doomed species in the journalistic menagerie.<br />\nThe column has taken its place. an accordance with the \"march of<br />\ncivilization\" the NEWS-LETTER is establishing immediately (or<br />\nrather re-establishing) a column. May it be better read than the<br />\neditorials.<br />\n<br />\nMILITARISM AND GRASS<br />\nYesterday and Wednesday the military unit of the university<br />\nwas inspected. \\\\Thich reminds us of the existence of an interesting paradox on the campus. Editorials are written, the Student<br />\nCouncil pleads, the Dean asks that students will please refrain<br />\nfrom walking on the grass. And then the whole R. 0. T. C. battalion marches officially on that very same grass. Under the \"iron<br />\nshod\" feet of our martially inclined the grass suffers far more than<br />\nwhen a nature-loving, peaceful undergraduate treads the turf gently<br />\nand lovingly. We advocate a plot of green grass where a pacifically<br />\nintentioned student may crunch the crisp but yielding herbage underfoot to his heart's content.<br />\n<br />\nTO EU ROPE<br />\nT U R.N<br />\n&<br />\n<br />\nFelix writes from\u2014<br />\nMonte Carlo<br />\nSay, old dear, didja ever dream of<br />\nbustin' the 1st Natl.

A deadly art he characterizes as \"one that is no fun<br />\nHopkins to a very high point. This<br />\nis a crucial game.<br />\nto be engaged in; one that gives the artist small fame, one that<br />\nmakes the artist feel 'suppose I do this extremely well, what then ?'\"<br />\nAll along the line\u2014\"from president down to coal-stoker,\" as<br />\nJohn Paul Bart would say\u2014there has been a general lamentation<br />\nat the decadence of editorial writing. Even our own campus<br />\nSkepticus bewails the fact that the editorials of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nare vapid and tiring. Another art has been lost, it is said. The<br />\nart of writing editorials has joined the art of illuminating manuscripts, of firing Wedgwood, of embalming mummies, and of a<br />\nthousand other delights of the good old days.<br />\nThe trouble is that the writer of editorials is an anachronism.<br />\nHe belongs back in the journalism of Addison and Steele. He is<br />\nbound by antiquated rules of style and of choice of subject. In a<br />\ntime when the \"personal note\" is all the rage the personality of the<br />\neditorial writer is lost by merging with the shadowy personality of<br />\nthe paper for which he writes. Now and then a William Allen<br />\nWhite rises to a position of influence by breaking every existing<br />\nrule of the dying \"art.\" But the average editor is never known by<br />\nthe public.<br />\nFew but devoted maiden ladies and the. staffs of rival papers<br />\nread the editorials. When the late Mr. Cobb died one or two newspaper men knew that one of the greatest editorial writers of America had died. The reading public were interested until they discovered that it was not Irvin S. Cobb nor Tyrus R. Cobb and then<br />\nthey promptly forgot all about the dead editor.<br />\nThe editorial is a doomed species in the journalistic menagerie.<br />\nThe column has taken its place. an accordance with the \"march of<br />\ncivilization\" the NEWS-LETTER is establishing immediately (or<br />\nrather re-establishing) a column.

Editorials are written, the Student<br />\nCouncil pleads, the Dean asks that students will please refrain<br />\nfrom walking on the grass. And then the whole R. 0. T. C. battalion marches officially on that very same grass. Under the \"iron<br />\nshod\" feet of our martially inclined the grass suffers far more than<br />\nwhen a nature-loving, peaceful undergraduate treads the turf gently<br />\nand lovingly.
