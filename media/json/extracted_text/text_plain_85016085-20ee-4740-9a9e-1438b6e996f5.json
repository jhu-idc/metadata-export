One coed was grabbed<br />\nfrom behind by a man who put<br />\nhis hand over her mouth at 9:55<br />\np.m. The girl managed to free<br />\nherself, and ran to safety into<br />\nRogers House.<br />\nThe next day at 10 p.m.,<br />\nanother coed claimed she was<br />\nfollowed by a man, but ran into<br />\nthe University One apartment<br />\nbuilding where she was visiting<br />\nsome friends for shelter. The man<br />\n<br />\nthen escaped down University<br />\nParkway. Both coeds were alone<br />\nwhen they were confronted.<br />\nIn each case Baltimore City<br />\nPolice and Hopkins security<br />\nguards were called onto the<br />\nscene. \"One suspect was seen<br />\nentering a behicle,\" said Jackson.<br />\n\"The police have the license<br />\nnumber. That will lead to further<br />\ndevelopments of the case. But<br />\ndescriptions of the two men are<br />\nsketchy.\"<br />\nAn increase of vandalisms and<br />\nthefts last week were due<br />\npartially to Halloween and the<br />\nUniversity activities as well as<br />\ncarelessness, according to<br />\nWeinbach and Jackson. \"People<br />\nattending the events here are<br />\nmore relaxed than usual,\" said<br />\nWeinbach.<br />\nA mailbox east of Shriver Hall<br />\nwas overturned and a light pole<br />\non Gilman.

The hiring of John Barth<br />\nlast year and Charles Newman this year were two bright indicators of the University's committment to maintaining<br />\nsuch a program at Hopkins. But, the possible termination<br />\nof the undergraduate major indicates that either such a program is not suitable for an undergraduate to have as his major, or that the architects of the Writing Seminars don't<br />\nwant to suit the program to undergraduates to a sufficient<br />\ndegree.<br />\nAs far as the suitability of writing as a major for undergrads, it seems that writing is no more limited as a major<br />\nin scope and application than, say, mathematics or history,<br />\nand is in many ways a far more illuminating field of study<br />\nthan these. For the University to maintain a first rate writing department, but not permit undergraduates to major in<br />\nit is both unfair and wasteful.<br />\nAnd, whether the Writing Seminars are designed suitable<br />\nto undergraduates is a question of committment on the<br />\npart of the department and the University. We wonder if<br />\nthe department is willing to devote its faculty members'<br />\ntime to advising undergraduates. We wonder if the members<br />\nof the revamped Seminars will consider undergraduates important enough so as to insure that the program is made<br />\ncomprehensive enough to provide an adequate major in writing for undergraduates.<br />\nIt seems to us that the suitability of theWriting Seminars for an undergraduate major does not depend so much<br />\non the nature of the major, but rather on the committment<br />\nthe department is willing to make to the instruction of undergraduates in good writing.<br />\nTherefore, we urge the Writing Seminars to maintain the<br />\nundergraduate major so as to insure that the department remains strong as far as student involvement and that the resources of the department are completely open to<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nBenton:The meteorologist who made good in Gar-Land<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nNot so long ago, before a guy<br />\nfrom Cornell named Muller became<br />\npresident of the University and a<br />\nmeteorologist named Benton<br />\nbecame vice president, there was<br />\nno Garland Hall, not because it<br />\ncouldn't be afforded, but because<br />\nit wasn't necessary,. In those days,<br />\nthe administrative offices were<br />\nscattered throughout Gilman Hall<br />\nand Homewood House. University<br />\npresidents had their offices next to<br />\nthose of the academic deans, while<br />\nother administrators were set side<br />\nby side with...professors. It was a<br />\nproper arrangement.<br />\nSince then, however, the official<br />\noffices have been relocated in<br />\nGarland Hall, that disinterred<br />\ncoffin of a building which strikes<br />\nevery visitor to the campus with its<br />\nmonolithic ugliness. Garland<br />\nHall\u2014how does one approach a<br />\nthing \"so simple and so huge?\"<br />\nAnd the cold, slick lines of Garland<br />\nreflect a change in the nature of<br />\nthe administration itself into a<br />\ncold, slick body of wretched<br />\nexcesses and all-pervading<br />\ndishonesty.<br />\nThe tale of the transformation is<br />\ntold by dated and yellowed<br />\nNews-Letters and by those<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity who were not only<br />\nhere to witness it but are willing to<br />\ntalk about it. All the evidence<br />\npoints to Homewood Vice<br />\nPresident George Benton as the<br />\narchitect of the metamorphosis.<br />\nPortrait of the Artist<br />\nThe history of Benton's<br />\n<br />\nascent\u2014from an academic dean to<br />\nthe effective head of the<br />\nHomewood campus and all its<br />\noperations\u2014is an ugly one, marred<br />\nby frequent and damaging<br />\nconflicts, and by distrust, that<br />\n'curse of the powerhungry. He is<br />\nmost often, and perhaps most<br />\naccurately, portrayed as a lover of<br />\npower, one determined to control<br />\neven the most minute aspects of<br />\nthe operation he supervises,<br />\ndetermined to make the<br />\nadministration his administration.<br />\nA former editor of the<br />\nNews-Letter described Benton to<br />\nme as \"a _very political person, a<br />\ntremendously political person.\"<br />\nThe News-Letters of Benton's first<br />\nyear as Dean, 1971-72, portray a<br />\nman possessed by a desire for<br />\ncontrol, and culminate with the<br />\noutline of a grisly scenario of<br />\npower plays and influence-wielding<br />\nin the final weeks of Lincoln<br />\nGordon's ill-fated presidency.<br />\nIn a lengthy news analysis of<br />\nthat period, then-editor Mark<br />\nReutter described the swirl of<br />\nproblems\u2014the \"lack of<br />\ncooperation'' and the<br />\n\"animosities\" between<br />\nadministrators\u2014which were the<br />\nsure portents of Gordon's fall, and<br />\nwhich were, in reality, cultivated<br />\nby Benton. Benton, who was<br />\npicked by Gordon to replace<br />\nformer Dean Allyn Kimball, was<br />\nforever undercutting the president<br />\nin private, and was \"expert at<br />\nplaying people off against one<br />\nanother for his own purposes,\"<br />\naccording to one faculty member.<br />\n<br />\nThus, Benton the manipulator, not<br />\nto be confused with Benton the<br />\ncruel, a persona born from his<br />\nlongstanding feud with University<br />\nChaplain Chester Wickwire which<br />\ndates, as far as anyone can<br />\ndetermine, back to 1970, the era<br />\nof student activism here.<br />\nTen students, it seems, contrived<br />\nto stage a symbolic protest against<br />\nthe Vietnam War, ROTC, and the<br />\nUniversity's investment policy, by<br />\n\"interrupting,\" as. the News-Letter<br />\nwas to describe it, a meeting of the<br />\nAcademic Council, forbidden<br />\nterritory to undergraduates. The<br />\nprotest was, in large part,<br />\norchestrated by Hopkins professors<br />\nRic Pfeffer, presently on leave, and<br />\nStephen Pepper, since departed.<br />\nThere was, of course, a<br />\nconsiderable ado which raged for<br />\nmonths, even though the offense<br />\nwas obviously less than grave.<br />\nBenton, so it is told, wanted the<br />\nmiscreants, many of whom were<br />\nsecond semester seniors, expelled.<br />\nNo diploma, no degree. Wickwire,<br />\nhowever, defended them before an<br />\nAppeals Board charged with the<br />\nresponsibility of determining<br />\ninnocence or guilt. Wickwire's<br />\neloquence was instrumental in<br />\nwinning eventual exoneration for<br />\nthe students and,so the story goes,<br />\nBenton never forgave him. The<br />\nevidence more than justifies this<br />\ninterpretation.<br />\nWhile Pfeffer got off with a<br />\n\"reprimand\" and Pepper with a<br />\n\"censure\" from outgoing Dean<br />\nKimball, Wickwire must pay for his<br />\ninsolence by enduring the<br />\nelaborate incursions into his<br />\n<br />\ndomain which Benton arranges<br />\nevery year. This year was no<br />\nexception as Benton tried to wrest<br />\nfrom Wickwire's grasp control of<br />\nthe Handbook on the impertinent<br />\nand absurd grounds that this year's<br />\nedition was \"difficult to carry\"<br />\nand \"jazzy.\" When the<br />\nNews-Letter and others rushed to<br />\nWickwire's succor, the powers that<br />\nbe reaffirmed his control of the<br />\npublication. For now,at least.<br />\nAnd Benton the cruel is never,<br />\nnever to be confused with Benton<br />\nthe powerful, an image first<br />\ncultivated by former News-Letter<br />\neditor Ted Rohrlich in a feature on<br />\nBenton published in September<br />\n1970, scant months after his<br />\nappointment as Dean. \"I know<br />\ndamn well I can organize this<br />\ncampus,\" postured Benton in one<br />\nof many outrageous quotes<br />\nattributed to him. \"Responsibility<br />\nwithout authority is not for me,\"<br />\nhe continued, expressing disdain<br />\nfor \"uncentralized authority.\"<br />\nResponsibility, Authority,<br />\nCentralization\u2014the dominant<br />\nthemes of Benton's rise.

Out of production, Mr.<br />\nLovejoy and to make sure you get<br />\nit I'll write it thus:\"Out of<br />\nProduction\". And where is<br />\nproduction carried on? There are<br />\nlots of \"productions\" on this<br />\ncampus but I see no production.<br />\nProduction occurs in the<br />\ncommunity and out there<br />\nsomewhere there are people called<br />\nproducers.

The MSE library<br />\nshould be open because this<br />\ninstitution is partly supported by<br />\nthe tax-payers' dollars and partly<br />\nfunded out of a private<br />\nappropriation of value from the<br />\ncommunity. To open the library<br />\nwould permit a little bit of the<br />\nsurplus which you and I have<br />\njointly appropriated to return to<br />\nwhere it belongs. And should Mr.<br />\nLovejoy perceive it otherwise, then<br />\nI suggest he try to find money (or<br />\nwhatever it represents) without the<br />\ncommunity.

To be slick, one must be<br />\nclever with words, and Benton is<br />\nan artisan with words. News-Letter<br />\nsleuths who queried Benton about<br />\ncost \"excesses\" in the construction<br />\nof the Hopkins Union were told<br />\nthat exact figures on the<br />\n\"overrun\" were not yet available.<br />\nOf course cost \"excesses' and cost<br />\n\"overruns\" are technically the<br />\nsame; but somehow \"overrun\"<br />\ndoesn't quite sound as bad.<br />\nAnd wedded to the<br />\nadministration's slickness is a<br />\ndishonesty so permeative and<br />\ncleverly employed as to gnaw on<br />\nthe imagination.

Kurt<br />\nplayed guitar last summer with<br />\nLundon Fugg, a local rhythm and<br />\nblues bandy and every lead he took<br />\non Saturday night bore out the<br />\nexperience he gained from having<br />\ndone so. His solo on Otis Redding's<br />\n\"Hot to Handle\" would have made<br />\nBobby Womack blush, it was that<br />\ngood. Yet Kurt's greatest moment<br />\nwas not during a soul tune, but<br />\nrather on one of his own<br />\ncompositions, \"Smiles Lightning.\"<br />\nThe song had proceeded as usual,<br />\nbuilding gradually toward the<br />\nbreak. The Kurt stepped up to take<br />\nhis lead and the whole goddamn<br />\nthing burst into flame. He sizzled<br />\nand soared, executing riffs as<br />\nbeautifully and dynamically<br />\nstructured as any rock and roller<br />\ncould hope to hear. And as if this<br />\nwasn't enough, Jim Owens (the<br />\nauthor of the tune's lyrics) vocally<br />\ncarried the piece to a concluding<br />\nclimax that was as incredible as it<br />\nwas unexpected. Those guy can<br />\nreally play it.<br />\nAnd the thing is that even if<br />\nOcean Rose was not the band of<br />\nhigh-energy viruosos that it is, the<br />\n<br />\nJimmy Owens<br />\nsheer eclecticism that is so<br />\ncharacteristic of the group would<br />\ninsure its success.

The hiring of John Barth<br />\nlast year and Charles Newman this year were two bright indicators of the University's committment to maintaining<br />\nsuch a program at Hopkins. But, the possible termination<br />\nof the undergraduate major indicates that either such a program is not suitable for an undergraduate to have as his major, or that the architects of the Writing Seminars don't<br />\nwant to suit the program to undergraduates to a sufficient<br />\ndegree.<br />\nAs far as the suitability of writing as a major for undergrads, it seems that writing is no more limited as a major<br />\nin scope and application than, say, mathematics or history,<br />\nand is in many ways a far more illuminating field of study<br />\nthan these. For the University to maintain a first rate writing department, but not permit undergraduates to major in<br />\nit is both unfair and wasteful.<br />\nAnd, whether the Writing Seminars are designed suitable<br />\nto undergraduates is a question of committment on the<br />\npart of the department and the University. We wonder if<br />\nthe department is willing to devote its faculty members'<br />\ntime to advising undergraduates. We wonder if the members<br />\nof the revamped Seminars will consider undergraduates important enough so as to insure that the program is made<br />\ncomprehensive enough to provide an adequate major in writing for undergraduates.<br />\nIt seems to us that the suitability of theWriting Seminars for an undergraduate major does not depend so much<br />\non the nature of the major, but rather on the committment<br />\nthe department is willing to make to the instruction of undergraduates in good writing.<br />\nTherefore, we urge the Writing Seminars to maintain the<br />\nundergraduate major so as to insure that the department remains strong as far as student involvement and that the resources of the department are completely open to<br />\nundergraduates.<br /><br />\nBenton:The meteorologist who made good in Gar-Land<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nNot so long ago, before a guy<br />\nfrom Cornell named Muller became<br />\npresident of the University and a<br />\nmeteorologist named Benton<br />\nbecame vice president, there was<br />\nno Garland Hall, not because it<br />\ncouldn't be afforded, but because<br />\nit wasn't necessary,. In those days,<br />\nthe administrative offices were<br />\nscattered throughout Gilman Hall<br />\nand Homewood House. University<br />\npresidents had their offices next to<br />\nthose of the academic deans, while<br />\nother administrators were set side<br />\nby side with...professors. It was a<br />\nproper arrangement.<br />\nSince then, however, the official<br />\noffices have been relocated in<br />\nGarland Hall, that disinterred<br />\ncoffin of a building which strikes<br />\nevery visitor to the campus with its<br />\nmonolithic ugliness. Garland<br />\nHall\u2014how does one approach a<br />\nthing \"so simple and so huge?\"<br />\nAnd the cold, slick lines of Garland<br />\nreflect a change in the nature of<br />\nthe administration itself into a<br />\ncold, slick body of wretched<br />\nexcesses and all-pervading<br />\ndishonesty.<br />\nThe tale of the transformation is<br />\ntold by dated and yellowed<br />\nNews-Letters and by those<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity who were not only<br />\nhere to witness it but are willing to<br />\ntalk about it. All the evidence<br />\npoints to Homewood Vice<br />\nPresident George Benton as the<br />\narchitect of the metamorphosis.<br />\nPortrait of the Artist<br />\nThe history of Benton's<br /><br />\nascent\u2014from an academic dean to<br />\nthe effective head of the<br />\nHomewood campus and all its<br />\noperations\u2014is an ugly one, marred<br />\nby frequent and damaging<br />\nconflicts, and by distrust, that<br />\n'curse of the powerhungry. He is<br />\nmost often, and perhaps most<br />\naccurately, portrayed as a lover of<br />\npower, one determined to control<br />\neven the most minute aspects of<br />\nthe operation he supervises,<br />\ndetermined to make the<br />\nadministration his administration.<br />\nA former editor of the<br />\nNews-Letter described Benton to<br />\nme as \"a _very political person, a<br />\ntremendously political person.\"<br />\nThe News-Letters of Benton's first<br />\nyear as Dean, 1971-72, portray a<br />\nman possessed by a desire for<br />\ncontrol, and culminate with the<br />\noutline of a grisly scenario of<br />\npower plays and influence-wielding<br />\nin the final weeks of Lincoln<br />\nGordon's ill-fated presidency.<br />\nIn a lengthy news analysis of<br />\nthat period, then-editor Mark<br />\nReutter described the swirl of<br />\nproblems\u2014the \"lack of<br />\ncooperation'' and the<br />\n\"animosities\" between<br />\nadministrators\u2014which were the<br />\nsure portents of Gordon's fall, and<br />\nwhich were, in reality, cultivated<br />\nby Benton. Benton, who was<br />\npicked by Gordon to replace<br />\nformer Dean Allyn Kimball, was<br />\nforever undercutting the president<br />\nin private, and was \"expert at<br />\nplaying people off against one<br />\nanother for his own purposes,\"<br />\naccording to one faculty member.<br /><br />\nThus, Benton the manipulator, not<br />\nto be confused with Benton the<br />\ncruel, a persona born from his<br />\nlongstanding feud with University<br />\nChaplain Chester Wickwire which<br />\ndates, as far as anyone can<br />\ndetermine, back to 1970, the era<br />\nof student activism here.<br />\nTen students, it seems, contrived<br />\nto stage a symbolic protest against<br />\nthe Vietnam War, ROTC, and the<br />\nUniversity's investment policy, by<br />\n\"interrupting,\" as. the News-Letter<br />\nwas to describe it, a meeting of the<br />\nAcademic Council, forbidden<br />\nterritory to undergraduates. The<br />\nprotest was, in large part,<br />\norchestrated by Hopkins professors<br />\nRic Pfeffer, presently on leave, and<br />\nStephen Pepper, since departed.<br />\nThere was, of course, a<br />\nconsiderable ado which raged for<br />\nmonths, even though the offense<br />\nwas obviously less than grave.<br />\nBenton, so it is told, wanted the<br />\nmiscreants, many of whom were<br />\nsecond semester seniors, expelled.<br />\nNo diploma, no degree. Wickwire,<br />\nhowever, defended them before an<br />\nAppeals Board charged with the<br />\nresponsibility of determining<br />\ninnocence or guilt. Wickwire's<br />\neloquence was instrumental in<br />\nwinning eventual exoneration for<br />\nthe students and,so the story goes,<br />\nBenton never forgave him. The<br />\nevidence more than justifies this<br />\ninterpretation.<br />\nWhile Pfeffer got off with a<br />\n\"reprimand\" and Pepper with a<br />\n\"censure\" from outgoing Dean<br />\nKimball, Wickwire must pay for his<br />\ninsolence by enduring the<br />\nelaborate incursions into his<br /><br />\ndomain which Benton arranges<br />\nevery year. This year was no<br />\nexception as Benton tried to wrest<br />\nfrom Wickwire's grasp control of<br />\nthe Handbook on the impertinent<br />\nand absurd grounds that this year's<br />\nedition was \"difficult to carry\"<br />\nand \"jazzy.\" When the<br />\nNews-Letter and others rushed to<br />\nWickwire's succor, the powers that<br />\nbe reaffirmed his control of the<br />\npublication. For now,at least.<br />\nAnd Benton the cruel is never,<br />\nnever to be confused with Benton<br />\nthe powerful, an image first<br />\ncultivated by former News-Letter<br />\neditor Ted Rohrlich in a feature on<br />\nBenton published in September<br />\n1970, scant months after his<br />\nappointment as Dean. \"I know<br />\ndamn well I can organize this<br />\ncampus,\" postured Benton in one<br />\nof many outrageous quotes<br />\nattributed to him. \"Responsibility<br />\nwithout authority is not for me,\"<br />\nhe continued, expressing disdain<br />\nfor \"uncentralized authority.\"<br />\nResponsibility, Authority,<br />\nCentralization\u2014the dominant<br />\nthemes of Benton's rise.

To be slick, one must be<br />\nclever with words, and Benton is<br />\nan artisan with words.

Kurt<br />\nplayed guitar last summer with<br />\nLundon Fugg, a local rhythm and<br />\nblues bandy and every lead he took<br />\non Saturday night bore out the<br />\nexperience he gained from having<br />\ndone so. His solo on Otis Redding's<br />\n\"Hot to Handle\" would have made<br />\nBobby Womack blush, it was that<br />\ngood. Yet Kurt's greatest moment<br />\nwas not during a soul tune, but<br />\nrather on one of his own<br />\ncompositions, \"Smiles Lightning.\"<br />\nThe song had proceeded as usual,<br />\nbuilding gradually toward the<br />\nbreak. The Kurt stepped up to take<br />\nhis lead and the whole goddamn<br />\nthing burst into flame. He sizzled<br />\nand soared, executing riffs as<br />\nbeautifully and dynamically<br />\nstructured as any rock and roller<br />\ncould hope to hear. And as if this<br />\nwasn't enough, Jim Owens (the<br />\nauthor of the tune's lyrics) vocally<br />\ncarried the piece to a concluding<br />\nclimax that was as incredible as it<br />\nwas unexpected.
