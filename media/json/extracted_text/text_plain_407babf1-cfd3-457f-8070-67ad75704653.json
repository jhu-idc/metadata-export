The writer has<br />\nwatched Johns Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nfor about ten years, and will go on<br />\nrecord as saying that he has never<br />\nseen a team that, in spirit and willingness to give all they had, in<br />\nspeed and stickwork and in ability<br />\nto swallow a keen disappointment<br />\nand come back fighting, surpassed<br />\nthe 1916 team.<br />\nWe won easily and decisively six<br />\nout of seven games.

REANEY WOLFE<br /><br />\nAlthough we lost the championship to Lehigh, the 1916 Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team is one of which the<br />\ncoaches and the University have a<br />\nright to feel proud. The writer has<br />\nwatched Johns Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nfor about ten years, and will go on<br />\nrecord as saying that he has never<br />\nseen a team that, in spirit and willingness to give all they had, in<br />\nspeed and stickwork and in ability<br />\nto swallow a keen disappointment<br />\nand come back fighting, surpassed<br />\nthe 1916 team.<br />\nWe won easily and decisively six<br />\nout of seven games. We piled up<br />\nthe largest number of goals during<br />\nthe season in the writer's experience\u2014a total of 68 in 7 games (an<br />\n. average of almost io goals per<br />\ngame)\u2014and held our opponents to<br />\na total of 20 goals.<br />\nAfter a two-weeks' rest we will<br />\nplay the Crescents of New York, a<br />\nharder task than beating Lehigh or<br />\nToronto, and the team is working<br />\nhard to carry off this last game.<br />\nBut, after all, we do not play<br />\nsolely for the pleasure and glory of<br />\nwinning. The real value of college<br />\nathletics lies in the training a man<br />\nreceives to bring his physical and<br />\nmuscular ability under the control<br />\nof his will.
