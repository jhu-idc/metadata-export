Growth<br />\n<br />\nseemed necessary, and the<br />\nMcElroy Committee on LongRange Expansion confirmed<br />\nthis with its June, 1966 report<br />\nwhich<br />\nfound<br />\nthe<br />\nadministration \"dangerously<br />\nunderstaffed\" and<br />\nstructurally antiquated. So<br />\nover the last five years the<br />\nadministration has tripled in<br />\nbudget and staff.<br />\nAlong with this growth,<br />\nhowever, came the problems<br />\nwhich eventually sparked<br />\nthe faculty to revolt.<br />\nThe turnover in key<br />\nadministrative posts gave to<br />\nmany a sense of a<br />\nuniversity coming apart at<br />\nthe seams. A look at one vital<br />\nposition, Vice-President for<br />\nAdministration, reveals a<br />\nparade of resignations<br />\nbeginning<br />\nwith<br />\nBruce<br />\nPartridge in<br />\n1969 and<br />\nculminating recently in the<br />\nDonald<br />\nspectacle<br />\nof<br />\nBlanchard leaving for<br />\nindustry a week before he<br />\nwas scheduled to take office.<br />\nInefficiency and waste<br />\nplagued too many of the<br />\nadministrative sections, and<br />\nfaculty resentment began to<br />\ngrow.<br />\nYet the hints of Lincoln<br />\nGordon's future demise did<br />\nnot really begin until last<br />\nNovember, when his new<br />\nHomewood Dean, George<br />\nBenton, frightened the<br />\nfaculty with the spectre of a<br />\n10 per cent faculty cut. The<br />\nresult would prove to be a<br />\nvictory of sorts for the senior<br />\nfaculty and Dean Benton: the<br />\nresignation<br />\nof<br />\nLincoln<br />\nGordon.<br />\nAs one prominent faculty<br />\nmember<br />\ncommented,<br />\n\"Benton knew they would<br />\nattack<br />\nthe size of the<br />\nadministration.<br />\nHe<br />\nstimulated faculty reaction.\"<br />\nFaculty members also had<br />\nbeen uneasy, since the<br />\nbeginning of student protests<br />\nhere three years ago, with<br />\nwhat they felt was Gordon's<br />\nlack of firmness.<br />\n(continued on reverse)<br />\n<br />\n\fGordon's Downfall Foreseen<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br />\n<br />\n(continued from front)<br />\n<br />\nNEWS<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\nexecutive editor<br />\nday editors<br />\nmanaging editors<br />\nphotography editor<br />\nsports editor<br />\n<br />\nMichael Hill, Art Levine<br />\nRussell Lemle, Harry Keyserling<br />\nStephen Tulloss<br />\nDon Lassus, Michael Weissman<br />\nRichard Waring, Howard Weaver<br />\nPeter Caloger<br />\nJay Lenrow<br />\n<br />\nP Namor<br />\n<br />\npatron saint<br />\n<br />\nThe Presidency<br />\n-Nobody wins in a game like this,\" said Dean Robert<br />\nStrider yesterday, and, indeed, his sober words should temper<br />\nany gleeful celebration of the president's resignation. There is<br />\nthe initial flush of victory when it is learned that the man so<br />\nlong fought, so long battered about by the undergraduate<br />\ncommunity, so many times despised for his diplomatic<br />\nramblings - - that this man has resigned. But then it must be<br />\nrealized that he was forced out by a senior faculty jealous of<br />\ntheir power and their right to do research unmolested by<br />\neither the meddlings of undergraduates or the financial<br />\ndifficulties of an incompetent president.<br />\nLincoln Gordon had to go. His administration bordered on<br />\nthe chaotic. His fund-raising, a task he admittedly loathed,<br />\nwas ineffectual. He had lost the faith of the students two years<br />\nago when he stood on the steps of Homewood House, flustered<br />\nand impotent in the face of a mild radical assault. And he lost<br />\nthe faith of the faculty last December when he told them, yes,<br />\nten per cent of your number are expendable, but no, we can't<br />\ncut any administrators. It was a position he tried to reverse too<br />\nlate.<br />\nLincoln Gordon had to go, and his departure clears the way<br />\nfor what could be a tremendous improvement in the<br />\nUniversity, for imaginative leadership that can lead us<br />\nthrough this tricky period of austerity. The unity<br />\ndemonstrated by the faculty in this ouster move is a hopeful<br />\nsign, for it shows that a group of men who rarely express an<br />\ninterest outside their esoteric academic fields can come<br />\ntogether with true concern for their University. If that concern<br />\ncan be fostered, if that awareness of what is best for the school<br />\ncan be continued, then Hopkins is in for an exciting period of<br />\nsustained improvement.<br />\nBut the danger is grave that the faculty, now that they have<br />\nflexed their muscles and proven themselves nearly invincible,<br />\nwill retreat into their various offices, cotent to let the<br />\nUniversity muck itself up again while they resist sorely<br />\nneeded innovations. They would show that their motive for<br />\nousting Gordon was simply to ensure their dominance in the<br />\nUniversity power structure.<br />\nIf this were to happen, the long - sought - for gains in<br />\nundergraduate education could quietly disappear. The<br />\ngovernance issue could once again be reduced to the<br />\nmutterings of a few malcontents. The University could cease<br />\nto critically examine its role in the problem - ridden society,<br />\nand innovative thinking would go the way of concern for the<br />\nUniversity, both becoming shadows that had substance only in<br />\nthe early months of 1971.<br />\nIt is up to the senior faculty, who led the revolt against<br />\nGordon and have shown that they possess the power, to see<br />\nthat this does not happen. Men like George Benton, Maurice<br />\nMan delbaum and George Owen must no take the initiative and<br />\nprevent their colleagues from falling into indifference.<br />\nCreative concern and community effort must guide the actions<br />\nof the faculty through the choosing of a successor to Lincoln<br />\nGordon. It is only by such efforts that the University can<br />\nsurvive this shock and begin to fulfill the promise it holds.<br />\n<br />\nEqually important was the<br />\ngrowing hostility between the<br />\nUniversity president and the<br />\ntough-minded dean he had<br />\nappointed to lead Homewood,<br />\nwith its deficit of nearly $2<br />\nmillion.<br />\nBenton emerged as the<br />\nspokesman of the old-guard<br />\nfaculty, concerned, as they<br />\nwere, with preserving the<br />\ntraditional graduate and<br />\nresearch orientation of the<br />\nThey were<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nhostile to Gordon's glib<br />\nacademic meddlings, such as<br />\nhis carte-blanche to Evening<br />\nCollege expansion and his<br />\nunilateral support of certain<br />\nStudent Council reforms.<br />\nAnd Benton and Gordon<br />\nsimply did not like each other<br />\npersonally. One could sense<br />\nthe tension between them as<br />\nearly as the strike last spring,<br />\nstill not<br />\nwhen Benton,<br />\nofficially dean, dominated the<br />\ndealings with the student<br />\nradicals.<br />\nThe turning point, though,<br />\nfor Gordon came at a<br />\nDecember meeting of the<br />\nfaculty General Assembly.<br />\nGordon at that time began a<br />\nthat<br />\nseries of blunders<br />\ninflamed senior faculty,<br />\neventually leading to his<br />\nresignation yesterday.<br />\nHe should have known that<br />\nit was important for him to<br />\nrespond seriously to a<br />\npetition which called for a<br />\nto<br />\ncommittee<br />\nfaculty<br />\ninvestigate administrative<br />\nfinances.<br />\nInstead, he<br />\nin<br />\nthe<br />\nrise<br />\ndefended<br />\nadministration costs, and<br />\ninsisted that it was too late to<br />\nlook into next year's budget.<br />\nA committee under the<br />\nleadership of Dr. George<br />\nOwen, Physics, began work<br />\nanyway.<br />\nAt that point, a wiser man<br />\nwould have done all he could<br />\nto salvage his crumbling<br />\nposition with the faculty.<br />\nInstead, he ended up further<br />\nantagonizing them with his<br />\nevasive response to requests<br />\nin<br />\ncut-backs<br />\nfor<br />\nadministration.

Growth<br /><br />\nseemed necessary, and the<br />\nMcElroy Committee on LongRange Expansion confirmed<br />\nthis with its June, 1966 report<br />\nwhich<br />\nfound<br />\nthe<br />\nadministration \"dangerously<br />\nunderstaffed\" and<br />\nstructurally antiquated. So<br />\nover the last five years the<br />\nadministration has tripled in<br />\nbudget and staff.<br />\nAlong with this growth,<br />\nhowever, came the problems<br />\nwhich eventually sparked<br />\nthe faculty to revolt.<br />\nThe turnover in key<br />\nadministrative posts gave to<br />\nmany a sense of a<br />\nuniversity coming apart at<br />\nthe seams. A look at one vital<br />\nposition, Vice-President for<br />\nAdministration, reveals a<br />\nparade of resignations<br />\nbeginning<br />\nwith<br />\nBruce<br />\nPartridge in<br />\n1969 and<br />\nculminating recently in the<br />\nDonald<br />\nspectacle<br />\nof<br />\nBlanchard leaving for<br />\nindustry a week before he<br />\nwas scheduled to take office.<br />\nInefficiency and waste<br />\nplagued too many of the<br />\nadministrative sections, and<br />\nfaculty resentment began to<br />\ngrow.<br />\nYet the hints of Lincoln<br />\nGordon's future demise did<br />\nnot really begin until last<br />\nNovember, when his new<br />\nHomewood Dean, George<br />\nBenton, frightened the<br />\nfaculty with the spectre of a<br />\n10 per cent faculty cut.

There is<br />\nthe initial flush of victory when it is learned that the man so<br />\nlong fought, so long battered about by the undergraduate<br />\ncommunity, so many times despised for his diplomatic<br />\nramblings - - that this man has resigned. But then it must be<br />\nrealized that he was forced out by a senior faculty jealous of<br />\ntheir power and their right to do research unmolested by<br />\neither the meddlings of undergraduates or the financial<br />\ndifficulties of an incompetent president.<br />\nLincoln Gordon had to go. His administration bordered on<br />\nthe chaotic. His fund-raising, a task he admittedly loathed,<br />\nwas ineffectual. He had lost the faith of the students two years<br />\nago when he stood on the steps of Homewood House, flustered<br />\nand impotent in the face of a mild radical assault. And he lost<br />\nthe faith of the faculty last December when he told them, yes,<br />\nten per cent of your number are expendable, but no, we can't<br />\ncut any administrators. It was a position he tried to reverse too<br />\nlate.<br />\nLincoln Gordon had to go, and his departure clears the way<br />\nfor what could be a tremendous improvement in the<br />\nUniversity, for imaginative leadership that can lead us<br />\nthrough this tricky period of austerity. The unity<br />\ndemonstrated by the faculty in this ouster move is a hopeful<br />\nsign, for it shows that a group of men who rarely express an<br />\ninterest outside their esoteric academic fields can come<br />\ntogether with true concern for their University. If that concern<br />\ncan be fostered, if that awareness of what is best for the school<br />\ncan be continued, then Hopkins is in for an exciting period of<br />\nsustained improvement.<br />\nBut the danger is grave that the faculty, now that they have<br />\nflexed their muscles and proven themselves nearly invincible,<br />\nwill retreat into their various offices, cotent to let the<br />\nUniversity muck itself up again while they resist sorely<br />\nneeded innovations. They would show that their motive for<br />\nousting Gordon was simply to ensure their dominance in the<br />\nUniversity power structure.<br />\nIf this were to happen, the long - sought - for gains in<br />\nundergraduate education could quietly disappear. The<br />\ngovernance issue could once again be reduced to the<br />\nmutterings of a few malcontents. The University could cease<br />\nto critically examine its role in the problem - ridden society,<br />\nand innovative thinking would go the way of concern for the<br />\nUniversity, both becoming shadows that had substance only in<br />\nthe early months of 1971.<br />\nIt is up to the senior faculty, who led the revolt against<br />\nGordon and have shown that they possess the power, to see<br />\nthat this does not happen. Men like George Benton, Maurice<br />\nMan delbaum and George Owen must no take the initiative and<br />\nprevent their colleagues from falling into indifference.<br />\nCreative concern and community effort must guide the actions<br />\nof the faculty through the choosing of a successor to Lincoln<br />\nGordon. It is only by such efforts that the University can<br />\nsurvive this shock and begin to fulfill the promise it holds.<br /><br />\nEqually important was the<br />\ngrowing hostility between the<br />\nUniversity president and the<br />\ntough-minded dean he had<br />\nappointed to lead Homewood,<br />\nwith its deficit of nearly $2<br />\nmillion.<br />\nBenton emerged as the<br />\nspokesman of the old-guard<br />\nfaculty, concerned, as they<br />\nwere, with preserving the<br />\ntraditional graduate and<br />\nresearch orientation of the<br />\nThey were<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nhostile to Gordon's glib<br />\nacademic meddlings, such as<br />\nhis carte-blanche to Evening<br />\nCollege expansion and his<br />\nunilateral support of certain<br />\nStudent Council reforms.<br />\nAnd Benton and Gordon<br />\nsimply did not like each other<br />\npersonally.
