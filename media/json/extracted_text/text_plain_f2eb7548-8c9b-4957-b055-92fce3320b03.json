Miranda had things had occurred: 1) she had<br />\nbeen watching TV for seven shot up in her seat as if elechours, unable to sleep, and the trocuted; 2) she sent a tiny gobcolorful shapes that danced across bit of phlegm (chartreuse, she<br />\nher screen were beginning now to remembered) onto the backpack<br />\nflicker patiently in her brain, like of the guy in front of her; and 3)<br />\nshe realized she was sick.<br />\na series of flip-card cartoons.<br />\nSince then, she had lived in the<br />\nZack, by contrast, had fallen<br />\ncompany of that least<br />\nconstant<br />\nasleep at the foot of Miranda's<br />\n\"Nightline\"<br />\nafter<br />\nbed shortly<br />\nbegan, and had spent the<br />\nevening\u2014two black and white<br />\nMiranda battles a<br />\nmovies, a game show, the PTL<br />\nClub, and now cartoons\u2014<br />\ncold along with<br />\ndreaming restlessly.

Probably the most significant successes are the ones<br />\nabout which the News-Letter and the organizers of LGAW will<br />\nnever hear. It is precisely the potential for unknowns that is<br />\nmost valuable about LGAW. Visibility and dialogue blow open<br />\nthe arena and create new spaces for things to happen in.<br />\nAs organizers of and participants in LGAW discovered, these<br />\nspaces open equally to those sympathetic and to those unsympathetic to the issues, and they become occupied by both constructive and destructive voices. Control over this is not possible or desirable. While the stolen banner, vandalized posters,<br />\ncrank phone calls, and the many hecklers are disturbing, they<br />\nmerely represent attitudes that are thought to run rampant in<br />\nthis community anyway. These cowardly acts of resistance and<br />\nprotest are certainly not surprising and should not be viewed<br />\nas strikes against or acts necessarily in opposition to the goals<br />\nof LGAW.<br />\nIn fact, one trap that is important to avoid is the assumption<br />\nof unified and universal goals, responsibilities, and identities<br />\ninvolved in LGAW (or in any critique of LGAW). Letters to<br />\nthe News-Letter this week stated resolutely the goals and most<br />\nimportant achievements of LGAW. Interestingly, each letter<br />\nfelt something different to be the most important achievement,<br />\nsingular goal, and oppressive opposition.<br />\nAnother dangerous assumption is that of stable definitions<br />\nof words like \"awareness,\" \"tolerance,\" \"non-homophobic<br />\nattitude,\" etc. Implicit in these assumptions is the path by which<br />\nthe \"states\" represented by these words could and should be<br />\nachieved. As if all those unenlightened members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity could become enlightened (\"non-homophobic,\"<br />\nwhatever that means) by undergoing an \"attitude adjustment.\"<br />\nThe events of LGAW then become steps along the path. And<br />\n<br />\nthe answer to homophobia at Hopkins is events like these, if<br />\nonly the community would come and be educated.<br />\nIt is not homophobic to point out the ways in which LGAW<br />\ndid not achieve what was understood to be some of the more<br />\nambitious goals laid out by the organizers. A production such<br />\nas LGAW is by nature exclusionary and insular on some level.<br />\nIn fact, this quality is necessary in order to achieve some of<br />\nLGAW's other stated goals, such as solidarity within the gay<br />\ncommunity at Hopkins.<br />\nIt's a sad fact that the people who most \"needed\" to be at<br />\nthe events of LGAW probably were not there, and that, despite<br />\nall their efforts, the organizers of LGAW did not \"reach out\"<br />\nto those people. Some campuses have reached a saturation point<br />\nfor words such as \"tolerance\" and \"awareness.\" Clearly this<br />\nis not the case at Hopkins, but even as we work toward it, it's<br />\nimportant to realize that once we reach that point, the job will<br />\nnot be done. If \"awareness\" was all it took to overcome prejudice, the fight might have already been over.<br />\nThere may come a time when members of the Hopkins community will add to their agenda for achieving \"awareness,<br />\nunderstanding, and tolerance for gay and lesbian issues\" attempts to reach more deeply and with greater subtlety into<br />\nenemy territory. (Subtlety is not necessarily called for but might<br />\nprove an effective tool.) When this time comes, it will be important to acknowledge the benefits of an LGAW program but<br />\nalso to look critically at what this program does not accomplish<br />\nand to ask the question, \"What else can we do?\"<br />\nIt may be idealistic of the News-Letter to suggest that GALA<br />\nsimply go further, beyond LGAW, if education is one of its<br />\ngoals. But it is also idealistic to assume that any discussion of<br />\nLGAW not awestruck and congratulatory is therefore<br />\nhomophobic and irresponsible. To do so would not do justice<br />\nto GALA's accomplishments\u2014one year ago no one would have<br />\nthought to push GALA to do more.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nNews-Letter Editorial off the Mark on Awareness Week<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs one of the coordinators of last<br />\nweek's Lesbian and Gay Awareness<br />\nWeek, I am writing,' With some incredulity, in response to March<br />\n29th's editorial \"Awareness, Not<br />\nWariness.\" The News-Letter<br />\ncharges GALA with programming<br />\ntha failed to \"serve\" the community adequately, with being overly<br />\nesoteric, with a lack of \"broad appeal,\" and with being \"a specialized intellectual conference [rather]<br />\nthan. . . a program for community<br />\nawareness.\" At the outset, I want to<br />\nstate my extreme frustration with<br />\nthese charges. The editors of the<br />\nNews-Letter seem to have failed to<br />\nattend any of the events to see if their<br />\ncharges had any merit or basis in<br />\nfact. They do not.<br />\nTo begin, only 3 or 4 events (out<br />\nof 21) were primarily of an academic<br />\ncharacter and I, for one, firmly<br />\nbelieve that this is not uncalled for<br />\nat one of the most important private<br />\nuniversities in the U.S. Not insignificantly, these were among the<br />\nbest attended events and had the<br />\nmost lively discussions. Beyond this,<br />\nthese charges are ironic because<br />\nsome of the most sophisticated and<br />\nimportant contributions to scholarship addressing lesbian and gay<br />\nissues has emerged from Hopkins.<br />\nIt seems that the editors of the NewsLetter have a rather narrow notion<br />\nof what it means to \"serve\" a<br />\nuniversity community.<br />\nThe question of esotericism provides a useful case in point. On can<br />\nonly wonder how \"esoteric' were<br />\nthe two panel discussions on AIDS,<br />\none of the most significant medical<br />\nemergencies of out time. We programmed these events because of the<br />\ndisproportionate effect of AIDS on<br />\ngays, but also because of the large<br />\nnumber of pre-med students at<br />\nHopkins and the international importance of Hopkins as an AIDS<br />\nresearch and treatment institution. It<br />\nis strange that these attempts to involve and serve the community went<br />\nunmentioned in the News-Letter's<br />\neditorial, as did most of our cultural<br />\nevents and the workshop/discussion<br />\ngroups scheduled to provide an opportunity for lesbians, gay men,<br />\nbisexuals, and straights to get<br />\ntogether and talk.<br />\nWe sought to demonstrate the<br />\nenormous range of activities that involve gays and lesbians\u2014something<br />\nwe clearly accomplished with the<br />\ndiversity of our participants, who<br />\nwere lawyers, doctors, scientists,<br />\ncommunity activists, politicians,<br />\nmuseum consultants, health care<br />\nproviders, students, artists, writers,<br />\nperformers, historians, literary<br />\ncritics, family members; black,<br />\nAsian, white, Hispanic; of every<br />\nclass background; republicans,<br />\ndemocrats, Marxists, socialists; and<br />\nmany other things as well. If non-<br />\n<br />\ngay/non-lesbian identified members<br />\nof the Hopkins community could not<br />\nfind something worth attending last<br />\nweek, we would, in fact, like their<br />\nconstructive suggestions. Unfortunately, what the News-Letter offered the Hopkins community was<br />\nan effacement of the many events we<br />\ndid plan for \"reaching out\" and,<br />\nwhat is worse, it offered the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity an excuse not to attend<br />\nevents.<br />\nBut most significantly, the NewsLetter participates in a heterosexist<br />\nconstruction of\"the community.\" It<br />\npresumes that the most important<br />\nthing a gay and lesbian group can do<br />\nis to help straights feel better about<br />\nhomosexualtiy, thereby assuming the<br />\nmost important members of' the<br />\ncommunity\" are heterosexuals. This<br />\nassumption is called heterosexism.<br />\nOne of the most prevalent forms of<br />\nopression gay men and lesbians face<br />\nis a \"closeting\" or making invisible<br />\nof their presence, their significance,<br />\nand their lives. This powerful<br />\n\"closeting\" effect, combined with<br />\nassumptions about the naturalness or<br />\nnormality of heterosexuality and the<br />\nunnaturalness or abnormality of<br />\nhomosexuality, allows people to fail<br />\nto understand how issues of lesbian<br />\nand gay sexuality are also issues of<br />\nheterosexuality. Further, this combination allows for a refusal to<br />\nengage these issues by insisting on<br />\ntheir irrelevance, insignificance, insularity, or pure minority appeal.<br />\nI do not believe that the NewsLetter's criticism was malicious or<br />\nhomophobic, but I do think it was<br />\nthoughtless, ignorant, and heterosexist. To answer News-Letters's supposedly \"rhetorical\" question: yes,<br />\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT thing<br />\nLesbian and Gay Awareness Week<br />\ncould have done was to support the<br />\nvisibility of gay and lesbian people.<br />\nThis, in and of itself, is a political<br />\nact engaging a community where oppression's primary form ensures the<br />\n<br />\ninvisibility of gays and lesbians by<br />\nviolently erasing the possiblity of<br />\nhomosexuality. Visibility was not<br />\nour onlrgoal nor was it the only<br />\nthing we accomplished, but it was<br />\nthe most important thing we did.<br />\nClearly, if there is to be awareness,<br />\nresponsible members of Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, such as the editors of<br />\nthe News-Letter, must bear the<br />\nburden of learning something about<br />\nthe forms oppression takes and about<br />\nwhat is involved in the efforts to<br />\ncombat it, particularly when as<br />\neasily accessible an opportunity as<br />\nLesbian and Gay Awareness Week<br />\nis offered to them.<br />\nT. Sean Holland<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI attended a number of the activities on GALA's Lesbian and Gay<br />\nAwareness Week calendar, and I<br />\nmust conclude that your editorial of<br />\nMarch 29, citing GALA's \"insular<br />\napproach,\" is deeply misguided and<br />\ninappropriate. In fact, the Lesbian<br />\nand Gay Awareness Week offered an<br />\nimpressive variety of events that<br />\nwere relevant to all facets of camfrom<br />\nlife.<br />\nSpeaking<br />\npus<br />\nexperience\u2014I have been both an<br />\nundergraduate and a graduate student at Hopkins\u2014I cannot recall a<br />\nsingle instance in which a campus<br />\ngroup has attempted more sincerely<br />\nand more effectively to address<br />\nissues crucial to the Hopkins community at large.<br />\nDoes the News-Letter really<br />\nbelieve that a forum on \"Lesbian &<br />\nGay Issues in Scholarship at<br />\nHopkins,\" or on \"Gay and Lesbian<br />\nCommunities in Baltimore\" is too<br />\nobscure or arcane for Hopkins<br />\nstudents? Or that a panel discussion<br />\non the treatment of AIDS is of no interest to the Hopkins community, not<br />\nto mention its present and future<br />\nmedical practicioners?

Did they see them on<br />\nthe calendar?<br />\nIt seems to me that GALA thought<br />\nvery carefully indeed about its<br />\nscheduling, and boldly endeavored<br />\nto address everyone's interests\u2014<br />\nwhether social, intellectual, educational, or political. Such thorough<br />\nand open-minded programming is<br />\nrarely seen at Johns Hopkins, as the<br />\nNews-Letter itself admits. If the<br />\neditors object to GALA also trying<br />\n\"to promote unity and awareness<br />\nwithin the Johns Hopkins gay community,\" then I must ask them to<br />\ntake another look around them, and<br />\nalso to re-read the headline article of<br />\nthe same issue (March 29) in which<br />\ntheir editorial appears. There are<br />\ndeep strains of homophobia and prejudice in the Hopkins \"university<br />\nclimate,\" and in such a climate,<br />\ngroups as public-minded and<br />\ncommunity-oriented as GALA are<br />\nsorely needed. GALA's efforts to<br />\npromote awareness, for homosexuals and bisexuals as well as<br />\nheterosexuals, are only to be congratulated. I sincerely hope that this<br />\nyear's Lesbian and Gay Awareness<br />\nWeek sets a precedent for years to<br />\ncome, a precedent whose importance<br />\nwill not be diminished by stumbling<br />\nblocks such as last week's NewsLetter editorial.<br />\nDavid H.

Events<br />\nsuch as the open mike were<br />\nspecifically aimed at reaching out to<br />\nall students. The aggressive postering campaign was meant to stimulate<br />\nthought and bring out feelings and<br />\nconcerns students have.

The<br />\nskies are gray and the ground is<br />\nwet. The turkey dinner reminds<br />\nme of vintage cafeteria food; of<br />\ncourse it is. I gobble it down; my<br />\nriding partner, Jodie, doesn't<br />\ntouch it.<br />\nAt the night's meeting, tour<br />\norganizer Pat Bernstein rattled off<br />\n<br />\nstatistics about the crowd: 72 percent male, 72 percent collegeeducated,<br />\n85<br />\npercent<br />\nMarylanders, 70 percent between<br />\n26 and 45 years old. \"Counselor<br />\nTom\" Carson gave prizes to a<br />\nbiker from Alaska, as well as to<br />\nthree 10-year olds and one man<br />\nover 70.<br />\n<br />\nThe evening's entertainment<br />\nwas some country band.

The<br />\nrain had let up; it was even slightly sunny. The first hour was pretty flat. Jodie left me behind, so<br />\nI rode alone. After a while on<br />\nRoute 1, I ran into Jodie again;<br />\nshe took a wrong turn some<br />\ndistance back.<br />\nFive minutes later, Jodie got a<br />\nflat tire. Surprisingly, she wasn't<br />\nthe first: the sag wagon supplying a bicycle punip had already<br />\nserviced a rider a few minutes<br />\nago.<br />\nWith the tire fixed, we<br />\nreached the first rest stop. We<br />\nstocked up on bananas and Exceed sport drink. In time, we<br />\nwould come to puke at the very<br />\nmention of bananas or Exceed,<br />\n<br />\nknee.

Two Yummy<br />\nPassover Recipes Anyone Will Like<br />\nby Chad Gadya<br />\n<br />\naaaaaaa Meal Pancakes<br />\n<br />\nThe Jewish festival of Passover<br />\ncelebrates the Israelites' freedom<br />\nfrom Egyptian slavery. But after<br />\na week, most just want freedom<br />\nfrom matzah. The flat cracker<br />\nthat is the week's staple isn't terribly tasty to begin with, and a<br />\nweek of it finds many craving a<br />\nsimple slice of bread or a pretzel.<br />\nBut just like Thanksgiving leftovers, matzah can be subtly<br />\ndisguised so you don't even know<br />\nyou're eating it. Two such recipes<br />\nare matzah meal pancakes and<br />\n\"fried matzah.\" Many will be<br />\nfamiliar with these traditional<br />\nrecipes, though others may have<br />\nnever been exposed to this typical<br />\nPassover fare.

Within the<br />\nlast year alone, plastic bottles<br />\nmade of polyethylene (milk and<br />\njuice containers) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) or PET<br />\n(the basic 2-liter soft drink bottle) have been included in the<br />\nrecycling efforts on Saturdays<br />\nacross from Memorial Stadium.<br />\nAs an aside, these two plastics<br />\nalone are approximately 6 percent<br />\n(by volume) of municipal solid<br />\nwaste; newspaper-14 percent<br />\n(don't forget to recycle this<br />\nNews-Letter).<br />\nBut what about polystyrene<br />\nfoam? How come you never hear<br />\nabout recycling it? Well, the main<br />\nreason is that polystyrene will<br />\nprobably never be included in<br />\nyour basic curbside recycling<br />\nprogram. Why? People do not<br />\ngenerate a lot of polystyrene foam<br />\nwaste in their homes and foam<br />\nfood service packaging is only 1<br />\npercent of municipal solid waste.<br />\nDoes this mean that it can't be<br />\nrecycled? Of course not.<br />\nPolystyrene foam producers recycle internally to minimize waste<br />\nand to maximize their usage of<br />\nthe material.<br />\nRecently, a new company, the<br />\nNational Polystyrene Recycling<br />\nCompany (NPRC), has been<br />\nformed to build polystyrene<br />\nrecyling plants. In 1989, the<br />\npolystyrene industry collected<br />\nand reprocessed 20 million<br />\npounds of polystyrene that would<br />\nhave ended up in a landfill! In<br />\nfact, a new plant is opening near<br />\nPhiladelphia this Spring to recycle the material. NPRC's goal\u2014<br />\nto be recycling 25 percent of<br />\npolystyrene packaging by 1995.<br />\nDo markets exist for the recycled polystyrene? The answer<br />\nis yes. Although the Food and<br />\nDrug Administration .(FDA)<br />\npresently does not allow used<br />\nfoodservice packaging', paper or<br />\nplastic, to be reused in contact<br />\nwith food, the food service industry only uses 16 percent of all<br />\nthe polystyrene. Recycled<br />\npolystyrene ends up in cafeteria<br />\ntrays (kind of ironic, isn't it?),<br />\nbuilding insulation, office products, flower pots, computer<br />\nhousings, and video cassettes.<br />\nSo, how do these facts enter<br />\ninto a decision regarding<br />\npolystyrene versus paper? I<br />\nbelieve that four areas should be<br />\nconsidered before making a<br />\nchoice: (1) material and energy<br />\nresource utilization, (2) environmental impact, (3)<br />\nrecyclability, and (4) consumer<br />\nneeds. Numerous studies have<br />\npoured out in recent years with<br />\npredictable results. Studies from<br />\n<br />\nthe paper industry say paper is the<br />\nsound choice, studies from the<br />\nplastics industry say that<br />\npolystyrene is the sound choice.<br />\nEven those studies from those not<br />\nconnected with either industry<br />\noften leave things out of the<br />\nanalysis. Why is this so difficult?<br />\nI'll try to shed some light on the<br />\ndifficulties in the context of the<br />\nfour areas I listed above.<br />\n1. Material and energy utilization. Polystyrene often gets a rap<br />\nfor wasting oil since it is a<br />\nbyproduct of the petrochemical<br />\nindusty. It must be remembered,<br />\nhowever, that oil can take the<br />\nform of a material (as in<br />\npolystyrene foam)or can take the<br />\nform of energy. All manufacturing operations require energy to<br />\nproduce their product. This is true<br />\nof paper making and of<br />\npolystyrene production. On a percup basis, polystyrene requires<br />\n3.2 grams of petroleum while a<br />\npaper cup requires between 2<br />\ngrams (American Paper Institute)<br />\nand 4.1 grams(MB. Hocking,<br />\nScience, Vol. 251, Feb. 1, 1991,<br />\np. 504).

On a day when six of the<br />\ntop seven teams were matched up<br />\nagainst each other, the Blue Jays,<br />\nnow riding a four-game winning<br />\nstreak and ranked number two in<br />\nthe latest USILA poll, dominated<br />\nthe previously undefeated<br />\nCavaliers. The game marked the<br />\nbest team effort of the season as<br />\nplayers at every position played<br />\na solid game. The defense<br />\nsmothered Virginia's high scoring super-soph Kevin Pehlke<br />\n(who had four goals in last year's<br />\nmeeting), limiting him to one goal<br />\nand one assist, and the team to<br />\nonly 6(they averaged 16 a game<br />\nin their first six). Meanwhile, the<br />\noffense was amassing sixteen<br />\ngoals and shell-shocking one of<br />\nthe country's premier goaltenders<br />\nin Tom Groeninger, who entered<br />\nthe day with a .602 save<br />\npercentage.<br />\nThe game began in a fashion<br />\nsimilar to recent weeks. After<br />\ntheir opponent jumped to an early lead, Hopkins' coach Tony<br />\nSeaman called time-out to settle<br />\nhis players and work his coaching<br />\nmagic. Virginia opened up with<br />\na 1-0 lead on Pehlke's goal just<br />\nseventeen seconds into the contest. The Cavs added two more,<br />\none on a great cut in front of the<br />\nnet and another on Andy Kraus's<br />\n<br />\nbouncer at 6:26. After that goal,<br />\nVirginia demonstrated their<br />\nclasslessness that has helped fuel<br />\nthis rivalry over the last four<br />\nyears. One of the UVa players<br />\ntaunted Blue Jay goalie Scott<br />\nGiardina, telling him that \"you<br />\n.\" That seemed to wake up<br />\nthe blossoming goaltender, who<br />\nrecorded 17 saves during the<br />\ngame, including four from point<br />\nblank range in the second quarter.<br />\nAfter that Wahoo outburst, the<br />\nrest of the game belonged to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nSenior tri-captain Bill Dwan<br />\ngrabbed a loose ball just over the<br />\nmidfield stripe.

As the Cavs tried to<br />\ndefend the long-pole break,<br />\nDwan dished to senior Michael<br />\nMorrissey on the left wing. The<br />\ndefense slid and Groeninger stepped out to cover the southpaw attackman who he found Jeff Wills<br />\nopen on the opposite side of the<br />\ncrease. Wills received the pass<br />\nand deposited the Jays' first goal<br />\nin an open net with 8:13 remaining in the first quarter. Virginia<br />\nreestablished their three-goal lead<br />\na minute and a half later when<br />\nGarth Appelt scored on a long<br />\nlow shot.<br />\nAfter Appelt's goal, the Jays<br />\nwent on a five-goal run by their<br />\nmidfielders to take a 6-4 lead, and<br />\nthey never looked back.

The women's team fell to<br />\nF&M by a score of 80-44.<br />\nThe meet, which took place on<br />\nWednesday, March 27, was an<br />\nexciting seesaw battle that went<br />\ndown to the wire. The tie<br />\nmarked the first time in several<br />\nyears that Hopkins was not beaten<br />\nby F&M, a traditional track<br />\npowerhouse in the MAC. \"We<br />\nperformed well,\" said coach Bob<br />\nBenson. \"These guys have really worked hard and it paid off for<br />\nus.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays got off to an early lead, as the 400 meter relay<br />\nteam of Eric Williams, Tommy<br />\nSpain, Robert Collins, and Forrest Clausson edged F&M 44.9<br />\nseconds to 45.5.

In the 5 km<br />\nrace, Robinson lost to his crosscountry rival Rob Monaco, who<br />\ntook advantage of Robinson's<br />\nfatigue from his earlier victory to<br />\nwin the event in a blistering<br />\n15:18.20. Heading into the field<br />\nevents, Hopkins trailed F&M<br />\n49-33.<br />\nThen came senior Glenn Sabin.<br />\nSabin swept all three throwing<br />\nevents in an impressive performance. \"Glenn should easily<br />\nmake the MAC's this year,\"<br />\nBenson said. Sabin led a Hopkins<br />\nsweep in the shotput with a winning put of 49'3\". Eric Hastings<br />\nplaced second (41'11\")and Sean<br />\nCasey took third (41'9\"). Sabin<br />\nwon the discus with a throw of<br />\n131'1\", while Hastings captured<br />\nthird with 115'10\".

A three-goal thild<br />\nquarter, combined with a defensive shutout left the Jays firmly<br />\nin command, 13-5, after three<br />\nperiods. Morrissey added his second goal of the game to open the<br />\nscoring in the fourth before Kraus<br />\nbroke the draugla for the<br />\nCavaliers. Less than two minutes<br />\nlater, Wright threw a cross field<br />\n<br />\npass to Wills who completed his<br />\nhat-trick.

The lecture was informative, but was meant more<br />\nas part memoir, history, and<br />\nreflection of their lives and what<br />\nthey saw in the growing gay/lesbian community.<br />\nThe lecture focused on essentially three parts that dealt with<br />\nthe proliferation of new feelings<br />\nof freedom and assertiveness that<br />\nthe homosexual sphere felt after<br />\nactive resistance to a police raid<br />\nof a gay bar in Stonewall Inn in<br />\nGreenwich Village, New York.<br />\nTo them, the pre-Stonewall<br />\nperiod was very exciting as the<br />\nfirst signs of a new liberal<br />\nideology among gays and lesbians<br />\nbegan to emerge. While Abelove<br />\npresented his own life experience<br />\nof the budding ideology, Barale<br />\ntold humorous stories about exciting moments of her life within<br />\nthe community.<br />\nThe first part of the talk took<br />\na very historical twist as Abelove<br />\ndiscussed his college life at Harvard, his graduate life at Yale and<br />\nhow old stereotypes inside the<br />\ngay population began to shift after<br />\nthe Stonewall incident. A greater<br />\nfeeling of agressiveness rather<br />\nthan passivity seemed to be evident, he said.<br />\nThe second half of the lecture<br />\nwas referred to as \"Coming<br />\nTogether\" with Abelove sharing<br />\nhis views on \"coming out\". In<br />\nthe 1930's, the words \"coming<br />\nout\" in the gay community<br />\nprimarily meant having your first<br />\ngay/lesbian erotic experience.<br />\nHowever, now it has become<br />\nmore a term for just meeting<br />\nmany other members of the community. This idea of \"coming<br />\nout\" soon became a statement of<br />\none's self and its popularity overshadowed the immediately past<br />\nStonewall era.<br />\nOne of the main points was the<br />\noverall critique of couplehood.<br />\nHenry stressed that the new<br />\ndesire should be to make sex in<br />\nthe gay/lesbian community as<br />\ngeneral as possible.

She tried to strike at the<br />\ncommon criticism of feminists by<br />\nrendering the expression<br />\n\"feminism is the theory and lesbianism is the practice\" devoid<br />\nof any possible meaning. Her<br />\nposition as a feminist, she<br />\nstressed, was more important and<br />\nat the same time separated from<br />\nher position as a lesbian.<br />\nThe last part of the lecture was<br />\ndubbed \"Comrades &amp; Lover\".<br />\nAbelove pointed out that the<br />\nnecessity to \"come out\" also had<br />\nsome problems associated with it.<br />\nThe first one being that it was<br />\ngenerally easier for the white,<br />\nmiddle class to have access to the<br />\ncommunity than for anyone on<br />\nthe outside of this select group.<br />\nHe pointed out that any other<br />\nloyalty, such as one's race would<br />\nbe another wall toward a totally<br />\nopen sexual gay/lesbian<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nAnother flaw in the ideology or<br />\nhow people viewed the idea was<br />\nthat something deep had to exist<br />\nwhen in essence, such feelings of<br />\npossessiveness between partners<br />\nwould inhibit free experiences<br />\nwith the rest of the community.<br />\nHe expressed his vision that all<br />\ngays/lesbians would get far more<br />\naggressive in the future.<br />\nDuring the question and answer<br />\nperiod, the new gay/lesbian<br />\nmovement was discussed in the<br />\nlight of the old.

Probably the most significant successes are the ones<br />\nabout which the News-Letter and the organizers of LGAW will<br />\nnever hear. It is precisely the potential for unknowns that is<br />\nmost valuable about LGAW. Visibility and dialogue blow open<br />\nthe arena and create new spaces for things to happen in.<br />\nAs organizers of and participants in LGAW discovered, these<br />\nspaces open equally to those sympathetic and to those unsympathetic to the issues, and they become occupied by both constructive and destructive voices. Control over this is not possible or desirable. While the stolen banner, vandalized posters,<br />\ncrank phone calls, and the many hecklers are disturbing, they<br />\nmerely represent attitudes that are thought to run rampant in<br />\nthis community anyway. These cowardly acts of resistance and<br />\nprotest are certainly not surprising and should not be viewed<br />\nas strikes against or acts necessarily in opposition to the goals<br />\nof LGAW.<br />\nIn fact, one trap that is important to avoid is the assumption<br />\nof unified and universal goals, responsibilities, and identities<br />\ninvolved in LGAW (or in any critique of LGAW). Letters to<br />\nthe News-Letter this week stated resolutely the goals and most<br />\nimportant achievements of LGAW. Interestingly, each letter<br />\nfelt something different to be the most important achievement,<br />\nsingular goal, and oppressive opposition.<br />\nAnother dangerous assumption is that of stable definitions<br />\nof words like \"awareness,\" \"tolerance,\" \"non-homophobic<br />\nattitude,\" etc. Implicit in these assumptions is the path by which<br />\nthe \"states\" represented by these words could and should be<br />\nachieved. As if all those unenlightened members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity could become enlightened (\"non-homophobic,\"<br />\nwhatever that means) by undergoing an \"attitude adjustment.\"<br />\nThe events of LGAW then become steps along the path. And<br /><br />\nthe answer to homophobia at Hopkins is events like these, if<br />\nonly the community would come and be educated.<br />\nIt is not homophobic to point out the ways in which LGAW<br />\ndid not achieve what was understood to be some of the more<br />\nambitious goals laid out by the organizers. A production such<br />\nas LGAW is by nature exclusionary and insular on some level.<br />\nIn fact, this quality is necessary in order to achieve some of<br />\nLGAW's other stated goals, such as solidarity within the gay<br />\ncommunity at Hopkins.<br />\nIt's a sad fact that the people who most \"needed\" to be at<br />\nthe events of LGAW probably were not there, and that, despite<br />\nall their efforts, the organizers of LGAW did not \"reach out\"<br />\nto those people. Some campuses have reached a saturation point<br />\nfor words such as \"tolerance\" and \"awareness.\" Clearly this<br />\nis not the case at Hopkins, but even as we work toward it, it's<br />\nimportant to realize that once we reach that point, the job will<br />\nnot be done. If \"awareness\" was all it took to overcome prejudice, the fight might have already been over.<br />\nThere may come a time when members of the Hopkins community will add to their agenda for achieving \"awareness,<br />\nunderstanding, and tolerance for gay and lesbian issues\" attempts to reach more deeply and with greater subtlety into<br />\nenemy territory. (Subtlety is not necessarily called for but might<br />\nprove an effective tool.) When this time comes, it will be important to acknowledge the benefits of an LGAW program but<br />\nalso to look critically at what this program does not accomplish<br />\nand to ask the question, \"What else can we do?\"<br />\nIt may be idealistic of the News-Letter to suggest that GALA<br />\nsimply go further, beyond LGAW, if education is one of its<br />\ngoals. But it is also idealistic to assume that any discussion of<br />\nLGAW not awestruck and congratulatory is therefore<br />\nhomophobic and irresponsible. To do so would not do justice<br />\nto GALA's accomplishments\u2014one year ago no one would have<br />\nthought to push GALA to do more.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nNews-Letter Editorial off the Mark on Awareness Week<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs one of the coordinators of last<br />\nweek's Lesbian and Gay Awareness<br />\nWeek, I am writing,' With some incredulity, in response to March<br />\n29th's editorial \"Awareness, Not<br />\nWariness.\" The News-Letter<br />\ncharges GALA with programming<br />\ntha failed to \"serve\" the community adequately, with being overly<br />\nesoteric, with a lack of \"broad appeal,\" and with being \"a specialized intellectual conference [rather]<br />\nthan. . . a program for community<br />\nawareness.\" At the outset, I want to<br />\nstate my extreme frustration with<br />\nthese charges. The editors of the<br />\nNews-Letter seem to have failed to<br />\nattend any of the events to see if their<br />\ncharges had any merit or basis in<br />\nfact. They do not.<br />\nTo begin, only 3 or 4 events (out<br />\nof 21) were primarily of an academic<br />\ncharacter and I, for one, firmly<br />\nbelieve that this is not uncalled for<br />\nat one of the most important private<br />\nuniversities in the U.S. Not insignificantly, these were among the<br />\nbest attended events and had the<br />\nmost lively discussions. Beyond this,<br />\nthese charges are ironic because<br />\nsome of the most sophisticated and<br />\nimportant contributions to scholarship addressing lesbian and gay<br />\nissues has emerged from Hopkins.<br />\nIt seems that the editors of the NewsLetter have a rather narrow notion<br />\nof what it means to \"serve\" a<br />\nuniversity community.<br />\nThe question of esotericism provides a useful case in point. On can<br />\nonly wonder how \"esoteric' were<br />\nthe two panel discussions on AIDS,<br />\none of the most significant medical<br />\nemergencies of out time. We programmed these events because of the<br />\ndisproportionate effect of AIDS on<br />\ngays, but also because of the large<br />\nnumber of pre-med students at<br />\nHopkins and the international importance of Hopkins as an AIDS<br />\nresearch and treatment institution. It<br />\nis strange that these attempts to involve and serve the community went<br />\nunmentioned in the News-Letter's<br />\neditorial, as did most of our cultural<br />\nevents and the workshop/discussion<br />\ngroups scheduled to provide an opportunity for lesbians, gay men,<br />\nbisexuals, and straights to get<br />\ntogether and talk.<br />\nWe sought to demonstrate the<br />\nenormous range of activities that involve gays and lesbians\u2014something<br />\nwe clearly accomplished with the<br />\ndiversity of our participants, who<br />\nwere lawyers, doctors, scientists,<br />\ncommunity activists, politicians,<br />\nmuseum consultants, health care<br />\nproviders, students, artists, writers,<br />\nperformers, historians, literary<br />\ncritics, family members; black,<br />\nAsian, white, Hispanic; of every<br />\nclass background; republicans,<br />\ndemocrats, Marxists, socialists; and<br />\nmany other things as well. If non-<br /><br />\ngay/non-lesbian identified members<br />\nof the Hopkins community could not<br />\nfind something worth attending last<br />\nweek, we would, in fact, like their<br />\nconstructive suggestions. Unfortunately, what the News-Letter offered the Hopkins community was<br />\nan effacement of the many events we<br />\ndid plan for \"reaching out\" and,<br />\nwhat is worse, it offered the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity an excuse not to attend<br />\nevents.<br />\nBut most significantly, the NewsLetter participates in a heterosexist<br />\nconstruction of\"the community.\" It<br />\npresumes that the most important<br />\nthing a gay and lesbian group can do<br />\nis to help straights feel better about<br />\nhomosexualtiy, thereby assuming the<br />\nmost important members of' the<br />\ncommunity\" are heterosexuals. This<br />\nassumption is called heterosexism.<br />\nOne of the most prevalent forms of<br />\nopression gay men and lesbians face<br />\nis a \"closeting\" or making invisible<br />\nof their presence, their significance,<br />\nand their lives. This powerful<br />\n\"closeting\" effect, combined with<br />\nassumptions about the naturalness or<br />\nnormality of heterosexuality and the<br />\nunnaturalness or abnormality of<br />\nhomosexuality, allows people to fail<br />\nto understand how issues of lesbian<br />\nand gay sexuality are also issues of<br />\nheterosexuality. Further, this combination allows for a refusal to<br />\nengage these issues by insisting on<br />\ntheir irrelevance, insignificance, insularity, or pure minority appeal.<br />\nI do not believe that the NewsLetter's criticism was malicious or<br />\nhomophobic, but I do think it was<br />\nthoughtless, ignorant, and heterosexist. To answer News-Letters's supposedly \"rhetorical\" question: yes,<br />\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT thing<br />\nLesbian and Gay Awareness Week<br />\ncould have done was to support the<br />\nvisibility of gay and lesbian people.<br />\nThis, in and of itself, is a political<br />\nact engaging a community where oppression's primary form ensures the<br /><br />\ninvisibility of gays and lesbians by<br />\nviolently erasing the possiblity of<br />\nhomosexuality. Visibility was not<br />\nour onlrgoal nor was it the only<br />\nthing we accomplished, but it was<br />\nthe most important thing we did.<br />\nClearly, if there is to be awareness,<br />\nresponsible members of Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, such as the editors of<br />\nthe News-Letter, must bear the<br />\nburden of learning something about<br />\nthe forms oppression takes and about<br />\nwhat is involved in the efforts to<br />\ncombat it, particularly when as<br />\neasily accessible an opportunity as<br />\nLesbian and Gay Awareness Week<br />\nis offered to them.<br />\nT. Sean Holland<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI attended a number of the activities on GALA's Lesbian and Gay<br />\nAwareness Week calendar, and I<br />\nmust conclude that your editorial of<br />\nMarch 29, citing GALA's \"insular<br />\napproach,\" is deeply misguided and<br />\ninappropriate. In fact, the Lesbian<br />\nand Gay Awareness Week offered an<br />\nimpressive variety of events that<br />\nwere relevant to all facets of camfrom<br />\nlife.<br />\nSpeaking<br />\npus<br />\nexperience\u2014I have been both an<br />\nundergraduate and a graduate student at Hopkins\u2014I cannot recall a<br />\nsingle instance in which a campus<br />\ngroup has attempted more sincerely<br />\nand more effectively to address<br />\nissues crucial to the Hopkins community at large.<br />\nDoes the News-Letter really<br />\nbelieve that a forum on \"Lesbian &amp;<br />\nGay Issues in Scholarship at<br />\nHopkins,\" or on \"Gay and Lesbian<br />\nCommunities in Baltimore\" is too<br />\nobscure or arcane for Hopkins<br />\nstudents? Or that a panel discussion<br />\non the treatment of AIDS is of no interest to the Hopkins community, not<br />\nto mention its present and future<br />\nmedical practicioners?

Did the<br />\neditors of the News-Letter attend<br />\nthese events? Did they see them on<br />\nthe calendar?<br />\nIt seems to me that GALA thought<br />\nvery carefully indeed about its<br />\nscheduling, and boldly endeavored<br />\nto address everyone's interests\u2014<br />\nwhether social, intellectual, educational, or political. Such thorough<br />\nand open-minded programming is<br />\nrarely seen at Johns Hopkins, as the<br />\nNews-Letter itself admits. If the<br />\neditors object to GALA also trying<br />\n\"to promote unity and awareness<br />\nwithin the Johns Hopkins gay community,\" then I must ask them to<br />\ntake another look around them, and<br />\nalso to re-read the headline article of<br />\nthe same issue (March 29) in which<br />\ntheir editorial appears. There are<br />\ndeep strains of homophobia and prejudice in the Hopkins \"university<br />\nclimate,\" and in such a climate,<br />\ngroups as public-minded and<br />\ncommunity-oriented as GALA are<br />\nsorely needed. GALA's efforts to<br />\npromote awareness, for homosexuals and bisexuals as well as<br />\nheterosexuals, are only to be congratulated. I sincerely hope that this<br />\nyear's Lesbian and Gay Awareness<br />\nWeek sets a precedent for years to<br />\ncome, a precedent whose importance<br />\nwill not be diminished by stumbling<br />\nblocks such as last week's NewsLetter editorial.<br />\nDavid H.

Events<br />\nsuch as the open mike were<br />\nspecifically aimed at reaching out to<br />\nall students. The aggressive postering campaign was meant to stimulate<br />\nthought and bring out feelings and<br />\nconcerns students have.

Two Yummy<br />\nPassover Recipes Anyone Will Like<br />\nby Chad Gadya<br /><br />\naaaaaaa Meal Pancakes<br /><br />\nThe Jewish festival of Passover<br />\ncelebrates the Israelites' freedom<br />\nfrom Egyptian slavery. But after<br />\na week, most just want freedom<br />\nfrom matzah. The flat cracker<br />\nthat is the week's staple isn't terribly tasty to begin with, and a<br />\nweek of it finds many craving a<br />\nsimple slice of bread or a pretzel.<br />\nBut just like Thanksgiving leftovers, matzah can be subtly<br />\ndisguised so you don't even know<br />\nyou're eating it. Two such recipes<br />\nare matzah meal pancakes and<br />\n\"fried matzah.\" Many will be<br />\nfamiliar with these traditional<br />\nrecipes, though others may have<br />\nnever been exposed to this typical<br />\nPassover fare.

Matzah meal pancakes<br />\nare particularly good with some<br />\nsort of sweet topping: applesauce,<br />\nsugar, honey, syrup, or grape jelly are all recommended.<br /><br />\nIn a large bowl beat the egg(s).<br />\nUse one or two eggs, your<br />\nchoice: two eggs may make a<br />\nlighter but more filling fried matzah. Add the milk and sugar.<br />\nBreak the matzah into small<br />\npieces and soak in the egg-milksugar mixture.

Within the<br />\nlast year alone, plastic bottles<br />\nmade of polyethylene (milk and<br />\njuice containers) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) or PET<br />\n(the basic 2-liter soft drink bottle) have been included in the<br />\nrecycling efforts on Saturdays<br />\nacross from Memorial Stadium.<br />\nAs an aside, these two plastics<br />\nalone are approximately 6 percent<br />\n(by volume) of municipal solid<br />\nwaste; newspaper-14 percent<br />\n(don't forget to recycle this<br />\nNews-Letter).<br />\nBut what about polystyrene<br />\nfoam? How come you never hear<br />\nabout recycling it? Well, the main<br />\nreason is that polystyrene will<br />\nprobably never be included in<br />\nyour basic curbside recycling<br />\nprogram. Why? People do not<br />\ngenerate a lot of polystyrene foam<br />\nwaste in their homes and foam<br />\nfood service packaging is only 1<br />\npercent of municipal solid waste.<br />\nDoes this mean that it can't be<br />\nrecycled? Of course not.<br />\nPolystyrene foam producers recycle internally to minimize waste<br />\nand to maximize their usage of<br />\nthe material.<br />\nRecently, a new company, the<br />\nNational Polystyrene Recycling<br />\nCompany (NPRC), has been<br />\nformed to build polystyrene<br />\nrecyling plants. In 1989, the<br />\npolystyrene industry collected<br />\nand reprocessed 20 million<br />\npounds of polystyrene that would<br />\nhave ended up in a landfill! In<br />\nfact, a new plant is opening near<br />\nPhiladelphia this Spring to recycle the material. NPRC's goal\u2014<br />\nto be recycling 25 percent of<br />\npolystyrene packaging by 1995.<br />\nDo markets exist for the recycled polystyrene? The answer<br />\nis yes. Although the Food and<br />\nDrug Administration .(FDA)<br />\npresently does not allow used<br />\nfoodservice packaging', paper or<br />\nplastic, to be reused in contact<br />\nwith food, the food service industry only uses 16 percent of all<br />\nthe polystyrene. Recycled<br />\npolystyrene ends up in cafeteria<br />\ntrays (kind of ironic, isn't it?),<br />\nbuilding insulation, office products, flower pots, computer<br />\nhousings, and video cassettes.<br />\nSo, how do these facts enter<br />\ninto a decision regarding<br />\npolystyrene versus paper? I<br />\nbelieve that four areas should be<br />\nconsidered before making a<br />\nchoice: (1) material and energy<br />\nresource utilization, (2) environmental impact, (3)<br />\nrecyclability, and (4) consumer<br />\nneeds. Numerous studies have<br />\npoured out in recent years with<br />\npredictable results. Studies from<br /><br />\nthe paper industry say paper is the<br />\nsound choice, studies from the<br />\nplastics industry say that<br />\npolystyrene is the sound choice.<br />\nEven those studies from those not<br />\nconnected with either industry<br />\noften leave things out of the<br />\nanalysis. Why is this so difficult?<br />\nI'll try to shed some light on the<br />\ndifficulties in the context of the<br />\nfour areas I listed above.<br />\n1. Material and energy utilization. Polystyrene often gets a rap<br />\nfor wasting oil since it is a<br />\nbyproduct of the petrochemical<br />\nindusty. It must be remembered,<br />\nhowever, that oil can take the<br />\nform of a material (as in<br />\npolystyrene foam)or can take the<br />\nform of energy. All manufacturing operations require energy to<br />\nproduce their product. This is true<br />\nof paper making and of<br />\npolystyrene production. On a percup basis, polystyrene requires<br />\n3.2 grams of petroleum while a<br />\npaper cup requires between 2<br />\ngrams (American Paper Institute)<br />\nand 4.1 grams(MB. Hocking,<br />\nScience, Vol. 251, Feb. 1, 1991,<br />\np. 504). Even though the paper<br />\nindustry does an excellent job of<br />\nusing waste bark for energy,<br />\npaper cups still require some<br />\npetroleum for energy needs, not<br />\nto mention the small amount<br />\nused to coat the paper (with wax<br />\nor polyethylene). Given that all<br />\nplastics consume between 2 and<br />\n3 percent of a barrel of oil, that<br />\npolystyrene is only 10 percent of<br />\nthe plastics made in this country,<br />\nand that foodservice polystyrene<br />\nis only 16 percent of the total<br />\npolystyrene, only a tiny fraction<br />\nof a barrel of oil goes to making<br /><br />\namounts of organochlorides and<br />\nmetal salts in wastewater from<br />\npaper making that is often sent to<br />\nmountain streams or the release<br />\nof small amounts of styrene in<br />\npetrochemical manufacturing?<br />\nWhich is worse, the leaching of<br />\npart-per-billion levels of dioxin<br />\nfrom bleached paper or the<br />\nleaching of part-per-billion levels<br />\nof styrene from a foam cup?<br />\nWhich is worse, the damage that<br />\ntree-cutting for paper products<br />\ncan have on erosion and forest<br />\nwildlife or the damage that oil<br />\nproduction and spills can have on<br />\nthe environment?<br />\nIsolating a single product, such<br />\nas a paper cup or a polystyrene<br />\nfoam cup, for a cradle-to-grave<br />\nElliott Chen<br />\nanalysis is nearly impossible due<br />\nover paper<br />\nadvantages<br />\nhave<br />\nto a lack of benefit/cost ratios.

Environmental impact. This<br />\nis where all hell breaks loose on<br />\nthis issue. Environmental debate<br />\ncan be an emotionally charged<br />\nundertaking. Comparatize studies<br />\nsuffer from two problems, leaving things out of the analysis(by<br />\naccident or on purpose) and failing to provide a tangible means<br />\nof assessing environmental cost.<br />\nFor example, proponents of paper<br />\nargue that polystyrene foam uses<br />\nozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons(CFC's)as a blowing agent<br />\nwithout discussing the alternative<br />\nblowing agents now used (pentane and carbon dioxide) or the<br />\nfact that foam producers can<br />\nrecycle their blowing agent and<br />\nuse the excess as fuel (instead of<br />\noil). On the other hand, proponents of wastewater and airborne particulates without<br />\ndiscussing whether or not these<br />\nwaste streams are properly<br />\ntreated before discharge.<br />\nProponents of paper argue that<br />\nit is biodegradable without mentioning that newspaper from landfills is readable after 20 years or<br />\nthat the plastic coating often<br />\nplaced on paper foodservice items<br />\nseverely hinders biodegradation.<br />\nThis issue has been turned around<br />\nby polystyrene proponents who<br />\nargue that the biodegradation of<br />\npaper produces methane and carbon dioxide, both greenhouse<br />\ngases, without discussing the<br />\npotential of recovering the<br />\nmethane for fuel. Even those who<br />\ntry to be objective often miss the<br />\nfine points of the analysis.<br />\nThe second problem deals with<br />\nbalancing relative environmental<br />\ncosts.

On a day when six of the<br />\ntop seven teams were matched up<br />\nagainst each other, the Blue Jays,<br />\nnow riding a four-game winning<br />\nstreak and ranked number two in<br />\nthe latest USILA poll, dominated<br />\nthe previously undefeated<br />\nCavaliers. The game marked the<br />\nbest team effort of the season as<br />\nplayers at every position played<br />\na solid game. The defense<br />\nsmothered Virginia's high scoring super-soph Kevin Pehlke<br />\n(who had four goals in last year's<br />\nmeeting), limiting him to one goal<br />\nand one assist, and the team to<br />\nonly 6(they averaged 16 a game<br />\nin their first six). Meanwhile, the<br />\noffense was amassing sixteen<br />\ngoals and shell-shocking one of<br />\nthe country's premier goaltenders<br />\nin Tom Groeninger, who entered<br />\nthe day with a .602 save<br />\npercentage.<br />\nThe game began in a fashion<br />\nsimilar to recent weeks. After<br />\ntheir opponent jumped to an early lead, Hopkins' coach Tony<br />\nSeaman called time-out to settle<br />\nhis players and work his coaching<br />\nmagic. Virginia opened up with<br />\na 1-0 lead on Pehlke's goal just<br />\nseventeen seconds into the contest. The Cavs added two more,<br />\none on a great cut in front of the<br />\nnet and another on Andy Kraus's<br /><br />\nbouncer at 6:26. After that goal,<br />\nVirginia demonstrated their<br />\nclasslessness that has helped fuel<br />\nthis rivalry over the last four<br />\nyears. One of the UVa players<br />\ntaunted Blue Jay goalie Scott<br />\nGiardina, telling him that \"you<br />\n.\" That seemed to wake up<br />\nthe blossoming goaltender, who<br />\nrecorded 17 saves during the<br />\ngame, including four from point<br />\nblank range in the second quarter.<br />\nAfter that Wahoo outburst, the<br />\nrest of the game belonged to<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nSenior tri-captain Bill Dwan<br />\ngrabbed a loose ball just over the<br />\nmidfield stripe. The defenseman<br />\ncarried the ball into the offensive<br />\nzone and established a numbers<br />\nadvantage. As the Cavs tried to<br />\ndefend the long-pole break,<br />\nDwan dished to senior Michael<br />\nMorrissey on the left wing. The<br />\ndefense slid and Groeninger stepped out to cover the southpaw attackman who he found Jeff Wills<br />\nopen on the opposite side of the<br />\ncrease. Wills received the pass<br />\nand deposited the Jays' first goal<br />\nin an open net with 8:13 remaining in the first quarter. Virginia<br />\nreestablished their three-goal lead<br />\na minute and a half later when<br />\nGarth Appelt scored on a long<br />\nlow shot.<br />\nAfter Appelt's goal, the Jays<br />\nwent on a five-goal run by their<br />\nmidfielders to take a 6-4 lead, and<br />\nthey never looked back. A cutting<br />\nBrian Lukacz received a pass<br />\nfrom Drew Burns on the left side<br />\nof the cage and shot a low ball into the net slicing the deficit to 4-2.<br />\nThe goal wiped out a cross<br /><br />\nTennis Rolls On<br />\nby Lorin Engquist<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins tennis team<br />\ncontinued its quest to compete<br />\nwith baseball and lacrosse for exposure by crushing Widener<br />\nUniversity 8-1 to up its record to<br />\n2,0.

Widener's number one<br />\nplayer had a style similar to that<br />\nof Engquist, hitting high, looping<br />\ntopspin shots, and, like Engquist,<br />\nwas quite content to stay on the<br />\nbaseline. Many expected a long<br />\nmatch, but Engquist was able to<br />\nwin points by opening up the<br />\ncourt with angled forehands. His<br />\nopponent seemed to have trouble<br />\njudging the vicious wind that is<br />\noften present during Hopkins tennis matches and made a bevy of<br />\nunforced errors.<br />\nMike Kim, playing number<br />\ntwo singles, won yet another<br />\nthree set marathon.

In a<br />\ndoubleheader sweep of Widener,<br />\n14-2 and 9-3, Trotta was six for<br />\neight and drove in six runs.

Joe Tortorello<br />\n(3-0, 3.94) pitched the second<br />\ngame, scattering nine hits on his<br />\nway to the 9-3 win.
