It was a sad blow to him, as<br />\nhe had been looking to the game (luring the whole year. Gillet, the big<br />\nfreshman, was prevented from playing by a death in his family. In<br />\nspite of these two instances of hard<br />\nluck the Hopkins team would have<br />\nmade a far better showing but for the<br />\nfact that Clary had his collarbone<br />\nbroken by a hard fall.<br />\nThe rough Canadian tactics of the<br />\nhusky Swarthmore players soon tired<br />\nout the lighter black and blue men.<br />\nThe visitors ran about the field almost at will, beating down by sheer<br />\nstrength the opposition of the Hopkins team.<br />\nMoore, the Swarthmore second attack, shot the first goal after a few<br />\nmoments of play. Hall, the acting;<br />\ncaptain of the Pennsylvanians, followed with another tally. Eddie Hulburt temporarily raised the hopes of<br />\nthe Hopkins contingent of rooters by<br />\ncaging the ball from a very difficult<br />\nangle. Then Clary was forced t.)<br />\nstop on account of his injury. When<br />\nhe left the field the close followers<br />\nOf the game saw that it was all up<br />\nWith Hopkins' chances.<br />\nDuring the remainder of the half<br />\nMoore shot three more goals and<br />\nPerkins tallied twice. The half ended with the score 7 to I.<br />\nFor a short time in the second half<br />\nthe Hopkins players held down their<br />\noPponents. But when the Swarthmore team got started it excelled even<br />\nIts fine work of the first session of<br />\nPlay.

No. 27.<br />\nCHAMPIONSHIP LOST<br />\nCrippled Hopkins Lacrosse Team<br />\n.. No Match for the Sturdy Players from Swarthmore \u2014 Clary<br />\nBadly Injured.<br />\nBy its defeat at the hands of the<br />\nSwarthmore team last Saturday, 16<br />\nto 3, the Hopkins lacrosse team lost<br />\nthe championship of the Southern<br />\nDivision of the Intercollegiate League<br />\nfor the first time in five years. The<br />\nWinners outplayed their opponents at<br />\nall stages of the game, and they<br />\nShowed the dashing, aggressive spirit<br />\nthat usually characterizes a championship team.<br />\nHopkins was badly crippled. Captain Schmeisser, the mainstay of the<br />\ndefense, could not play on account of<br />\nthe injury he received in the Stevens<br />\ngame. It was a sad blow to him, as<br />\nhe had been looking to the game (luring the whole year. Gillet, the big<br />\nfreshman, was prevented from playing by a death in his family. In<br />\nspite of these two instances of hard<br />\nluck the Hopkins team would have<br />\nmade a far better showing but for the<br />\nfact that Clary had his collarbone<br />\nbroken by a hard fall.<br />\nThe rough Canadian tactics of the<br />\nhusky Swarthmore players soon tired<br />\nout the lighter black and blue men.<br />\nThe visitors ran about the field almost at will, beating down by sheer<br />\nstrength the opposition of the Hopkins team.<br />\nMoore, the Swarthmore second attack, shot the first goal after a few<br />\nmoments of play. Hall, the acting;<br />\ncaptain of the Pennsylvanians, followed with another tally. Eddie Hulburt temporarily raised the hopes of<br />\nthe Hopkins contingent of rooters by<br />\ncaging the ball from a very difficult<br />\nangle. Then Clary was forced t.)<br />\nstop on account of his injury. When<br />\nhe left the field the close followers<br />\nOf the game saw that it was all up<br />\nWith Hopkins' chances.<br />\nDuring the remainder of the half<br />\nMoore shot three more goals and<br />\nPerkins tallied twice. The half ended with the score 7 to I.<br />\nFor a short time in the second half<br />\nthe Hopkins players held down their<br />\noPponents. But when the Swarthmore team got started it excelled even<br />\nIts fine work of the first session of<br />\nPlay. As an incentive to roll up a<br />\nlarge score, each Swarthmore playev<br />\nWas promised a dollar for each goal<br />\nhe shot. Perkins and Moore each<br />\nearned a 44\\7,9 for himself in this way.<br />\nlburt and Gail each scored for<br />\nRopkins in this half.<br />\nThe whole Swarthmore team played well. Perkins and Moore were<br /><br />\nBaltimore, Md., May 16, 1910.<br />\nthe individual stars on the attack, but<br />\nthey were finely supported at all<br />\ntimes by their teammates. By their<br />\nspeed the maroon and white players<br />\nmanaged to get the \"extra man\" a<br />\nnumber of times, and as can be seen<br />\nfrom the score they usually made it.<br />\ncount.<br />\nStockett and Hulburt played well<br />\nfor Hopkins. Raleigh, the acting captain, also did some fine work for the<br />\nlocal team, and Keith, at point, played a heady game. Gus Vogeler livened things up a bit at the end of<br />\nthe second half. He gave his opponents some hard raps that delighted<br />\nthe grandstand.<br />\nGeneral Summary:<br />\nSwarthmore \u2014 Atldinson, goal;<br />\nBackies, point; Leikens, coverpoint<br />\nSeamen, first defense; Miller, second<br />\ndefense; C.

This motion was the<br />\nsignal for a spirited and prolonged<br />\ndebate, during which the views of<br />\nboth sides were expressed with vigor<br />\nan earnestness. A rising vote was<br />\nfinally taken, and the motion was<br />\ncarried by a considerable majority.<br />\nThis action was the result of a<br />\nvigorous campaign by the supporters<br />\nof baseball, whose views had<br />\non<br />\nmany adherents during the past few<br />\nweeks. The decision to introduce<br />\nbaseball makes this meeting historical in its importance to Hopkins athletics.<br />\nIn speaking about the adoption of<br />\nbaseball Dr. Magoffin, of the Historical Department, said:<br />\n\"There is no reason why the University can not develop and support<br />\na winning team. The number of students is increasing, and it ought not<br />\nto interfere with the lacrose and<br />\ntrack teams.
