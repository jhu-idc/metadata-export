The present<br />\nCouncil, probably one of the most respected ever here, has<br />\nmade its recommendations to the administration for the<br />\nrecord.<br />\nThe ball is now in the court of the faculty and administration.

I have gained<br />\na great love and respect for the institution itself, a sentiment I find<br />\nvery hard to communicate to nonmembers. When they see a fraternity in action, usually during an<br />\nopen party, the most obvious features are the drinking, the girls and<br />\nthe music. On this their concept of<br />\nthe organization is based. However,<br />\nif one looks beyond this aspect of<br />\nthe organization perhaps to a<br />\nplaque on the wall or to a page in<br />\nthe membership book, one will<br />\nfind the creed and ideals of the<br />\nbrotherhood.. Although each one<br />\nis phrased differently, words like<br />\n\"honor\", \"truth\", and \"love\", are<br />\ncommon to all. It is here that the<br />\nbeauty lies, for fraternitites are one<br />\nof the few institutions that -actively<br />\nencourage virtue without equating<br />\nit with abstinence. Thus the<br />\nseeming contradiction of revelry<br />\nand love of virtue can be resolved.<br />\nMost people are aware of the<br />\n\"sensational\" aspects of fraternity<br />\n<br />\nlife, the parties, the pranks and the<br />\nnegative connotations associated<br />\nwith them. Thus when a fraternity<br />\nman's behavior is. childish and inconsiderate it is commonly attributed to the fact, that he is in a<br />\nfraternity and such behavior is fostered there. If, however, his behavior is sociable and sincere the<br />\nfact that he is in a fraternity is<br />\neither forgotten or comes to mind<br />\nonly as an afterthought.<br />\nThe problem lies in the fact<br />\nthat, as with any life-style, the fraternity ways can be lived well or<br />\npoorly. There will always be some<br />\nwho wish to experience it as social<br />\ncompetition and must rely on<br />\nslurs, stereotyping and peculiar behavior to maintain or elevate their<br />\npositiOn in the hierarchy of fraternity social status. But there are<br />\nothers who make close friendships,<br />\nhave memorable experiences and<br />\nare actively concerned with their<br />\npersonal growth through the brotherhood. The one is more visible<br />\nthan the other, and no doubt it is<br />\nfor this reason that fraternities are<br />\nknown for their clique-ishness and<br />\ncrude behavior.<br />\nPhilip Burlington<br />\n<br />\nAlmost everybody goes to the<br />\nrush parties. That's not where the<br />\nsplit manifests itself. The whole<br />\nquestion of forming fraternities is<br />\nwhat gets to people. Some feel that<br />\npledging is the act of a fool; they<br />\ndon't even consider it. There are<br />\nothers, however, who are very<br />\n\"gung ho\" aboutfrats. Most people<br />\nfeel strongly one way or the other.<br />\nThere are aspects to fraternities<br />\nwhich justify both sides.<br />\nFor example, it is apparent to<br />\nme that frat rush can be an anesthetizing experience. It can get to<br />\nthe point, with students mindlessly<br />\nshuffling around, ramming into<br />\neach other, slipping and sliding on<br />\na floor drenched with beer, where<br />\n<br />\nan entire frat house can turn into a<br />\n<br />\nzoo for zombies. Nonetheless, the<br />\nfrat rush experience often becomes<br />\nan intensely personal one. It might<br />\nbe the furthest extent to which a<br />\nstudent has ever been thrust into<br />\nan alternative existence. College is<br />\nnot the new life many of us left<br />\nhome for. That life consists of<br />\nwhat one actually does at college.<br />\nFraternity can be a special mode of<br />\nexistence. It means a lot to some<br />\npeople to be called \"brother.\"<br />\nI've heard upperclassmen say<br />\nthat frat rush is a great time for<br />\nfreshmen because it gives them free<br />\nbeers and a chance to get their ass<br />\nkissed. But nobody gets their ass<br />\nkissed unless they profer it. If the<br />\nconcept of \"fraternity\" (it's incredible how many forget the meaning of the word) means anything<br />\nto you, and a sincere interest<br />\ncauses you to talk to people, and<br />\nthat in turn generates an equally<br />\nsincere response, then it's something less than getting your ass kissed, it's something worthwhile.<br />\nBut the occasional chaotic nature of the fraternities is what<br />\ncauses the anesthetic effect. It's_<br />\n<br />\nnot even w-61-th denying that some<br />\nfrats here thrive on a \"zoo\" existence. It all depends on one's tolerance level. That's why different<br />\npeople choose different frats, and<br />\nsome choose none.<br />\nThere is, of course, the negative<br />\nconnotation of fraternities\u2014the<br />\nviolent, senseless aspect. This is<br />\nepitomized by the incident last<br />\nfall, when a pledge in New Jersey<br />\ngot killed on a beach. People see<br />\nthe violence elsewhere and they<br />\nbegin to develop a slightly warped<br />\nperspective of the nature of what's<br />\nhappening here. There is, a distinct, meritorious objective behind<br />\nthe concept of fraternity, which<br />\ntoo often finds itself muddled by<br />\nthe anesthetic aspect. The sincere,<br />\npersonal interaction, the real guts<br />\nof any fraternity, is too easily ignored.<br />\nNone of this is based on compiled histories, extensive interviews<br />\nor the like. Maybe that's good. I<br />\ncan think of few human conditions<br />\nor emotions that can never be broken down and rationalized. Two<br />\nthat come to mind are love and<br />\nbrotherhood.<br />\n<br />\nLast Thursday night Dave Brubeck played to an SRO crowd at Shriver. Joined by saxophone greats Gerry<br />\nMulligan and Paul Desmond, as well as his sons'Darius Brubeck Ensemble, they came back for two encores<br />\nto leave the audience well satisfied.<br />\n<br />\n. whatever it is<br />\nobviously transcended these surface differences: We were all upset<br />\nthat someone was letting whites<br />\nbeat on black kids.

The only reason it even came<br />\nto mind was that two nights before<br />\nI witnessed that scene, I was at a<br />\nrush party where the band, cornprised of members of the particular<br />\nfrat, was desperately trying to get<br />\neveryone excited. At one point,<br />\none of them shouted out, \"Is<br />\neveryone having a good time<br />\nhere!\"<br />\n\"Yeah!\" The throng shouted<br />\nback.<br />\nActually, the similarity between<br />\nthe two events is limited. No doubt<br />\nthe reader will assert that there is<br />\nbeing made here an implicit statement about the nature of frater-<br />\n<br />\nanyone opposed to busing. It is interesting to note that this definition was never publically challenged.<br />\nComrade\u2014A comrade was someone that an acronym agreed with.<br />\nEnemy of the Workers\u2014This was<br />\nthe same speaker one speech later.<br />\nRevolutionary politics\u2014Ours.<br />\nCapitalist Oppression\u2014Theirs.<br />\nCause for applause\u2014Any logically presented idea, not necessarily<br />\nright, just logically consistent.<br />\nBrothers and Sisters\u2014As the<br />\nconcerence prolgessea, this began<br />\n.44<br />\nr1J17<br />\n<br />\nwax,<br />\nA---<br />\n<br />\nof a school system best<br />\n<br />\nouts, charges aria countercharges, a<br />\n<br />\ndescribed as \"separate but separate.\" Twenty years after the first<br />\nSupreme Court ruling mandating a<br />\nunitary educational system, a federal judge ordered a plan for desegregation. This is now Law. The implementation of this Law includes<br />\n\"busing.\" Opposition of justice<br />\nmanifested itself in the form of<br />\nspeeches, rallies, letters, stonings,<br />\nbeatings and bombings. This culminated in the near lynchings of<br />\nmembers of the Black community.<br />\nTacit support of this form of behavior seemed to ensue from surprising sectors, including members of<br />\nthe School Board, business community, local police force, and the<br />\nlike. The ability of these people to<br />\nengage in \"doublethink\" is nothing<br />\nless than astounding. For example,<br />\nthis law-abiding group is the same<br />\nmotley crew that opposes, say, the<br />\nuse of glass based on the high<br />\nethical stand that \"it is illegal.\"<br />\nAnd yet, these people do not hesitate to take the law into their own<br />\nhands when they are among the<br />\ndissatisfied. The Conference was<br />\nbrought in 'order to establish an organization that by virtue of its<br />\nweight of numbers could displace<br />\nthe power and political position of<br />\nthe anti-desegregation forces.<br />\n\"Let's do something<br />\npositive...let's do it.\"<br />\nA brief glossary of terms heard<br />\nat the conference:<br />\nRacist\u2014A racist was defined as<br />\n<br />\nfeeling was growing, slowly but<br />\nsurely. It was in this burgeoning<br />\nspirit that the resolutions for action were passed.<br />\n\"...legislation and court orders<br />\ntend only to declare rights; they<br />\ncan<br />\nnever thoroughly deliver<br />\nthem. Only when the people themselves begin to act are rights on<br />\npaper given life blood.\"<br />\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr.<br />\nThe immediate results of this<br />\nconference are simple and direct.<br />\nFirst and foremost, the body endorsed the NAACP sponsored May<br />\n17 demonstration to be centered<br />\nin Boston and echoed throughout<br />\nthe country. It is to be noted that<br />\nthis date will mark the 21st anniversary of the original Supreme<br />\nCourt desegregation ruling. Secondly, a new organization was<br />\nformed, titled National Student<br />\nCoalition Against Racism<br />\n(NSCAR). It was designated to<br />\nunite all those people \"advocating<br />\nits objectives, regardless of political<br />\nviews or opinions.\"<br />\nA- majorpart of this effort involves the establishment of local organizations, and the<br />\nBaltimore-Washington area is no<br />\nexception.

The<br />\ngame, however, did not turn out<br />\nthat way.<br />\nBefore a capacity crowd, the<br />\n<br />\nShoremen started out like a ball<br />\nof fire. When Hopkins' big man<br />\nDrew Fender got into foul<br />\ntrouble early in the first half, the<br />\nHomewood quintet was forced to<br />\nalter their original strategy and<br />\nthe game turned into a run-andshoot affair.<br />\n\"In the first half, it looked like<br />\nGeorge Washington was playing<br />\nfor them,\" said Rupert. \"They<br />\nplayed extremely well.\" Defense<br />\nwas pretty well an unknown<br />\nquantity in the first half as the<br />\nhosts led by an inflated 52-48<br />\nscore at intermission.<br />\nSmarter.<br />\n\"We started playing smarter in<br />\nthe second half,\" Rupert continued. \"We tightened up our defense and continued to shoot<br />\nwell.\"<br />\nThe Jays utilized three defensive alignments in cooling off<br />\nWashington. Hopkins used both<br />\n2-3 and 1-3-1 zones as well as an<br />\naggressive man-to-man and outscored the Shoremen 46-37 in<br />\nthe second half.<br />\nPlaying in the final game of<br />\ntheir Hopkins careers, Paul<br />\nSpence had 14 points and 10 as-<br />\n<br />\nsists, fellow co-captain Greg<br />\nDeLong had 16 points and 14 rebounds, and Oscar Schreiber contributed 8 points and 4 rebounds.<br />\nThose three along with reserve<br />\nMark McConnell will be the only<br />\nplayers which the Jays will lose<br />\nto graduation.<br />\nTop Man<br />\nPacing the Blue Jays scoring<br />\nwas sophomore Andy Scheinfeld<br />\nwith 19 points and 9 rebounds.<br />\n<br />\nhe has improved a great deal and<br />\nwill get better.\"<br />\nDrew Fender chipped in with<br />\n7 points and 15 rebounds despite<br />\nbeing hampered by foul trouble<br />\nwhich allowed him to play only<br />\nfifteen minutes.

The present<br />\nCouncil, probably one of the most respected ever here, has<br />\nmade its recommendations to the administration for the<br />\nrecord.<br />\nThe ball is now in the court of the faculty and administration.

Except now it was 6:30<br />\nam and we were in Boston.<br />\nThinking only of breakfast, the<br />\ntwo of use accompanied one of our<br />\nnew \"brothers\" to the Buttery, a<br />\nlocal coffee house, where we became the victims of a socialistic<br />\ncrossfire: an omen of sorts which<br />\nwas a bit too subtle for our early<br />\nmorning sensitivities.<br />\nEntering the school auditorium,<br />\nregistration cards clutched firmly<br /><br />\n/thrice, or so it seemed.

Everybody else<br />\nhad a \"Master Plan\" and were discussing the \"context of the Revolution.\" What Revolution? We<br />\nthought this conference was supposed to be about busing or something like that. And yet these earnest, dedicated, people threw their<br />\nnets over us and proceeded to try<br />\nand sell us bargain subscriptions to<br />\nthe Daily Militant Spartacus<br />\nUnited World, or some variation<br />\nthereof. In fact, it was two hours<br />\ninto the conference bedore anyone<br />\nseriously addressed the topic of desegregation.<br />\n\"Twenty-one years is too<br />\nlong...\" Politics notwithstanding,<br />\nover 1500 people had traveled over<br />\n40 hours (from Houston) and over<br />\n3000 miles (from California and<br />\nOregon). There were Chicanos and<br />\nLatinos, Whites and Blacks, Jews,<br />\nChristians, Muslims and atheists, all<br />\nbrought together in a cause which<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor: _<br />\nAs a senior fraternity member<br />\nwith many friends in other brotherhoods, I have had a long and<br />\nmany faceted perspective on fraternity life at Hopkins. I have gained<br />\na great love and respect for the institution itself, a sentiment I find<br />\nvery hard to communicate to nonmembers. When they see a fraternity in action, usually during an<br />\nopen party, the most obvious features are the drinking, the girls and<br />\nthe music. On this their concept of<br />\nthe organization is based. However,<br />\nif one looks beyond this aspect of<br />\nthe organization perhaps to a<br />\nplaque on the wall or to a page in<br />\nthe membership book, one will<br />\nfind the creed and ideals of the<br />\nbrotherhood.. Although each one<br />\nis phrased differently, words like<br />\n\"honor\", \"truth\", and \"love\", are<br />\ncommon to all. It is here that the<br />\nbeauty lies, for fraternitites are one<br />\nof the few institutions that -actively<br />\nencourage virtue without equating<br />\nit with abstinence. Thus the<br />\nseeming contradiction of revelry<br />\nand love of virtue can be resolved.<br />\nMost people are aware of the<br />\n\"sensational\" aspects of fraternity<br /><br />\nlife, the parties, the pranks and the<br />\nnegative connotations associated<br />\nwith them. Thus when a fraternity<br />\nman's behavior is. childish and inconsiderate it is commonly attributed to the fact, that he is in a<br />\nfraternity and such behavior is fostered there. If, however, his behavior is sociable and sincere the<br />\nfact that he is in a fraternity is<br />\neither forgotten or comes to mind<br />\nonly as an afterthought.<br />\nThe problem lies in the fact<br />\nthat, as with any life-style, the fraternity ways can be lived well or<br />\npoorly. There will always be some<br />\nwho wish to experience it as social<br />\ncompetition and must rely on<br />\nslurs, stereotyping and peculiar behavior to maintain or elevate their<br />\npositiOn in the hierarchy of fraternity social status. But there are<br />\nothers who make close friendships,<br />\nhave memorable experiences and<br />\nare actively concerned with their<br />\npersonal growth through the brotherhood. The one is more visible<br />\nthan the other, and no doubt it is<br />\nfor this reason that fraternities are<br />\nknown for their clique-ishness and<br />\ncrude behavior.<br />\nPhilip Burlington<br /><br />\nAlmost everybody goes to the<br />\nrush parties. That's not where the<br />\nsplit manifests itself. The whole<br />\nquestion of forming fraternities is<br />\nwhat gets to people. Some feel that<br />\npledging is the act of a fool; they<br />\ndon't even consider it. There are<br />\nothers, however, who are very<br />\n\"gung ho\" aboutfrats. Most people<br />\nfeel strongly one way or the other.<br />\nThere are aspects to fraternities<br />\nwhich justify both sides.<br />\nFor example, it is apparent to<br />\nme that frat rush can be an anesthetizing experience. It can get to<br />\nthe point, with students mindlessly<br />\nshuffling around, ramming into<br />\neach other, slipping and sliding on<br />\na floor drenched with beer, where<br /><br />\nan entire frat house can turn into a<br /><br />\nzoo for zombies. Nonetheless, the<br />\nfrat rush experience often becomes<br />\nan intensely personal one. It might<br />\nbe the furthest extent to which a<br />\nstudent has ever been thrust into<br />\nan alternative existence. College is<br />\nnot the new life many of us left<br />\nhome for. That life consists of<br />\nwhat one actually does at college.<br />\nFraternity can be a special mode of<br />\nexistence. It means a lot to some<br />\npeople to be called \"brother.\"<br />\nI've heard upperclassmen say<br />\nthat frat rush is a great time for<br />\nfreshmen because it gives them free<br />\nbeers and a chance to get their ass<br />\nkissed. But nobody gets their ass<br />\nkissed unless they profer it. If the<br />\nconcept of \"fraternity\" (it's incredible how many forget the meaning of the word) means anything<br />\nto you, and a sincere interest<br />\ncauses you to talk to people, and<br />\nthat in turn generates an equally<br />\nsincere response, then it's something less than getting your ass kissed, it's something worthwhile.<br />\nBut the occasional chaotic nature of the fraternities is what<br />\ncauses the anesthetic effect. It's_<br /><br />\nnot even w-61-th denying that some<br />\nfrats here thrive on a \"zoo\" existence. It all depends on one's tolerance level. That's why different<br />\npeople choose different frats, and<br />\nsome choose none.<br />\nThere is, of course, the negative<br />\nconnotation of fraternities\u2014the<br />\nviolent, senseless aspect. This is<br />\nepitomized by the incident last<br />\nfall, when a pledge in New Jersey<br />\ngot killed on a beach. People see<br />\nthe violence elsewhere and they<br />\nbegin to develop a slightly warped<br />\nperspective of the nature of what's<br />\nhappening here. There is, a distinct, meritorious objective behind<br />\nthe concept of fraternity, which<br />\ntoo often finds itself muddled by<br />\nthe anesthetic aspect. The sincere,<br />\npersonal interaction, the real guts<br />\nof any fraternity, is too easily ignored.<br />\nNone of this is based on compiled histories, extensive interviews<br />\nor the like. Maybe that's good. I<br />\ncan think of few human conditions<br />\nor emotions that can never be broken down and rationalized. Two<br />\nthat come to mind are love and<br />\nbrotherhood.<br /><br />\nLast Thursday night Dave Brubeck played to an SRO crowd at Shriver.

Those who<br />\nknew were laying the word on<br />\nthose who didn't. In small workshops, people from the frontlines<br />\nlike Kim O'Brian, an assaulted<br />\nwhite bus driver, Rosemary Sport,<br />\na local teacher, and Charlotte<br />\nNelson, first V.P. of the Boston<br />\nMAACP were giving the word:<br />\n\"You know everything that you<br />\nread in the papers'? It's all true.<br />\nmore?'<br /><br />\nVAlexatIvs,<br /><br />\nTime;the 'Movement\" was dead.<br /><br />\nnity rush. That's not quite the<br />\ncase. But, for me at least, the<br />\nevents did correlate, both in a ternporal and schematic sense.<br />\nNow, whatever I say about fraternities, there will be people who<br />\nwill tell me that I didn't know<br />\nwhat the hell I'm talking about.<br />\nThe concept of fraternities seems<br />\nto bring out that sort of ideological<br />\npolarization in people.eol pH<br />\nleo<br />\n.<br /><br />\nBrubeck at Hopkins<br /><br />\nCome and do it!<br />\nBy JEFFREY WEISS<br />\nand<br />\nLISA LUBIN<br />\nThe following article was inspired by the National Student Conference Against Racism, held on<br />\nFeb. 14-16 in Boston.

The only reason it even came<br />\nto mind was that two nights before<br />\nI witnessed that scene, I was at a<br />\nrush party where the band, cornprised of members of the particular<br />\nfrat, was desperately trying to get<br />\neveryone excited. At one point,<br />\none of them shouted out, \"Is<br />\neveryone having a good time<br />\nhere!\"<br />\n\"Yeah!\" The throng shouted<br />\nback.<br />\nActually, the similarity between<br />\nthe two events is limited. No doubt<br />\nthe reader will assert that there is<br />\nbeing made here an implicit statement about the nature of frater-<br /><br />\nanyone opposed to busing. It is interesting to note that this definition was never publically challenged.<br />\nComrade\u2014A comrade was someone that an acronym agreed with.<br />\nEnemy of the Workers\u2014This was<br />\nthe same speaker one speech later.<br />\nRevolutionary politics\u2014Ours.<br />\nCapitalist Oppression\u2014Theirs.<br />\nCause for applause\u2014Any logically presented idea, not necessarily<br />\nright, just logically consistent.<br />\nBrothers and Sisters\u2014As the<br />\nconcerence prolgessea, this began<br />\n.44<br />\nr1J17<br /><br />\nwax,<br />\nA---<br /><br />\nof a school system best<br /><br />\nouts, charges aria countercharges, a<br /><br />\ndescribed as \"separate but separate.\" Twenty years after the first<br />\nSupreme Court ruling mandating a<br />\nunitary educational system, a federal judge ordered a plan for desegregation. This is now Law. The implementation of this Law includes<br />\n\"busing.\" Opposition of justice<br />\nmanifested itself in the form of<br />\nspeeches, rallies, letters, stonings,<br />\nbeatings and bombings. This culminated in the near lynchings of<br />\nmembers of the Black community.<br />\nTacit support of this form of behavior seemed to ensue from surprising sectors, including members of<br />\nthe School Board, business community, local police force, and the<br />\nlike. The ability of these people to<br />\nengage in \"doublethink\" is nothing<br />\nless than astounding. For example,<br />\nthis law-abiding group is the same<br />\nmotley crew that opposes, say, the<br />\nuse of glass based on the high<br />\nethical stand that \"it is illegal.\"<br />\nAnd yet, these people do not hesitate to take the law into their own<br />\nhands when they are among the<br />\ndissatisfied. The Conference was<br />\nbrought in 'order to establish an organization that by virtue of its<br />\nweight of numbers could displace<br />\nthe power and political position of<br />\nthe anti-desegregation forces.<br />\n\"Let's do something<br />\npositive...let's do it.\"<br />\nA brief glossary of terms heard<br />\nat the conference:<br />\nRacist\u2014A racist was defined as<br /><br />\nfeeling was growing, slowly but<br />\nsurely.

It is to be noted that<br />\nthis date will mark the 21st anniversary of the original Supreme<br />\nCourt desegregation ruling. Secondly, a new organization was<br />\nformed, titled National Student<br />\nCoalition Against Racism<br />\n(NSCAR). It was designated to<br />\nunite all those people \"advocating<br />\nits objectives, regardless of political<br />\nviews or opinions.\"<br />\nA- majorpart of this effort involves the establishment of local organizations, and the<br />\nBaltimore-Washington area is no<br />\nexception.
