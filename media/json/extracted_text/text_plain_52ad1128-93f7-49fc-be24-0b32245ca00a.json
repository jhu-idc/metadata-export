Why not, they say, rename<br />\nthe Civil Engineering Building, the Mechanical Engineering<br />\nBuilding, and the Chemical Laboratory, honoring men who<br />\nhave been conspicuous in their devotion and service to Hopkins.<br />\nNo official notice has ever been given these suggestions,<br />\nthough it would be an extremely simple matter to carry them \u2022<br />\nout. Possibly there is no one whose name at present suggests<br />\nitself as appropriate for either of the engineering buildings,<br />\nbut the time surely is most propitious for rechristening the<br />\nChemical Laboratory.<br />\nThe recent death of Dr. Ira Remsen presents an opportunity for honoring a great Hopkins scientist. Dr. Remsen<br />\nwas one whose name will live as long as Johns Hopkins University continues to exist. His aid in the discovery of saccharin, his untiring love of research, his devotion to his life work,<br />\nand his unselfish attitude towards his profession are qualities<br />\nwhich are synonymous with his name.<br />\nTo us, it seems that no more fitting memorial could be<br />\nmade to the great chemist than by renaming the present<br />\nChemical Laboratory in his honor. By calling that building<br />\nRemsen Hall, his name may be forever kept before the student body in the same way as Dr. Gillman's memory is perpetuated.<br />\n<br />\nLOCAL TALENT IS GOOD ENOUGH<br />\nWe do not know whether the decision of the June Week<br />\nCommittee to hire a local orchestra for its dances was influenced chiefly by sumptuary reasons or whether it believed<br />\nthat Baltimore couples can actually dance better to Baltimore<br />\nmusic. Either way, it seems to us, they were right.<br />\nThe cost of importing an orchestra for three or four days<br />\nis probably four to five times the cost of using Mr. \"Bob\"<br />\nlula's excellent music. When a jazz band plays over the<br />\nradio once or twice it assumes that it has acquired a national<br />\nreputation, and hence its presence at a dance is supposed to<br />\nenhance the \"good time had by all\" to such an extent that it<br />\ncan raise its rates five hundred per cent. Can't the dancers<br />\nsay for the next week,\"Why we had so-and-so's music\u2014came<br />\nall the way from New Rochelle!\"<br />\nThis psychological effect is responsible for more than<br />\nhalf the enthusiasm aroused over out-of-town orchestras. The<br />\naverage young man or girl could hardly distinguish the renowned George Olsen's band from \"Bob\" Iula's if he were not<br />\ntold which were which. But combinations like that of Olsen<br />\nand others have Reputations, and can command huge prices.<br />\nWhen the glamor of June Week has worn off and the revelers have returned to the routine of their daily life, they will<br />\nprobably thank the committee for saving them five or ten<br />\ndollars.<br />\n<br />\nFORD OWNERS<br />\nDORM DOINGS<br />\n<br />\nGET A SUPER CARBURETOR<br />\nand with it<br />\nInstant Starting<br />\n<br />\nPick-up<br />\nThe dorm dance was successful Quicker<br />\nMore Power<br />\nMore Mileage<br />\nas far as can be determined.

Why not, they say, rename<br />\nthe Civil Engineering Building, the Mechanical Engineering<br />\nBuilding, and the Chemical Laboratory, honoring men who<br />\nhave been conspicuous in their devotion and service to Hopkins.<br />\nNo official notice has ever been given these suggestions,<br />\nthough it would be an extremely simple matter to carry them \u2022<br />\nout. Possibly there is no one whose name at present suggests<br />\nitself as appropriate for either of the engineering buildings,<br />\nbut the time surely is most propitious for rechristening the<br />\nChemical Laboratory.<br />\nThe recent death of Dr. Ira Remsen presents an opportunity for honoring a great Hopkins scientist. Dr. Remsen<br />\nwas one whose name will live as long as Johns Hopkins University continues to exist. His aid in the discovery of saccharin, his untiring love of research, his devotion to his life work,<br />\nand his unselfish attitude towards his profession are qualities<br />\nwhich are synonymous with his name.<br />\nTo us, it seems that no more fitting memorial could be<br />\nmade to the great chemist than by renaming the present<br />\nChemical Laboratory in his honor. By calling that building<br />\nRemsen Hall, his name may be forever kept before the student body in the same way as Dr. Gillman's memory is perpetuated.<br /><br />\nLOCAL TALENT IS GOOD ENOUGH<br />\nWe do not know whether the decision of the June Week<br />\nCommittee to hire a local orchestra for its dances was influenced chiefly by sumptuary reasons or whether it believed<br />\nthat Baltimore couples can actually dance better to Baltimore<br />\nmusic. Either way, it seems to us, they were right.<br />\nThe cost of importing an orchestra for three or four days<br />\nis probably four to five times the cost of using Mr. \"Bob\"<br />\nlula's excellent music. When a jazz band plays over the<br />\nradio once or twice it assumes that it has acquired a national<br />\nreputation, and hence its presence at a dance is supposed to<br />\nenhance the \"good time had by all\" to such an extent that it<br />\ncan raise its rates five hundred per cent. Can't the dancers<br />\nsay for the next week,\"Why we had so-and-so's music\u2014came<br />\nall the way from New Rochelle!\"<br />\nThis psychological effect is responsible for more than<br />\nhalf the enthusiasm aroused over out-of-town orchestras. The<br />\naverage young man or girl could hardly distinguish the renowned George Olsen's band from \"Bob\" Iula's if he were not<br />\ntold which were which. But combinations like that of Olsen<br />\nand others have Reputations, and can command huge prices.<br />\nWhen the glamor of June Week has worn off and the revelers have returned to the routine of their daily life, they will<br />\nprobably thank the committee for saving them five or ten<br />\ndollars.<br /><br />\nFORD OWNERS<br />\nDORM DOINGS<br /><br />\nGET A SUPER CARBURETOR<br />\nand with it<br />\nInstant Starting<br /><br />\nPick-up<br />\nThe dorm dance was successful Quicker<br />\nMore Power<br />\nMore Mileage<br />\nas far as can be determined.
