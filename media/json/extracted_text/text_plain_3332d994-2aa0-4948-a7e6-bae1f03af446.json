In short, he must<br />\nhave all the attributes one seeks<br />\nin a man worthy of the presidency, not of the University, but of<br />\nthis great nation. He must be a<br />\nwinning personality.

Who is going to<br />\ntake the helm of the academic<br />\nship of state? Amid the frenzied<br />\nmaelstrom of speculation this<br />\nweek, many esteemed names<br />\nhave been bandied about, and it<br />\nis possible that Dr. Eisenhower<br />\nwill once again assume his role<br />\nas Republican Kingmaker. Indeed, many of the names mentioned have been those of members of the G.O.P. hierarchy.<br />\nNixon, Scranton, Romney, the<br />\ngreat names of the sixties, are<br />\nall in the forefront, and the entire Hopkins community is eagerly holding its breath in anticipation, and wondering, Who<br />\nwill it be?<br />\nIn the midst of all this speculation the News-Letter would<br />\nlike to offer its candidate for<br />\nthis esteemed office, and to provide, as it has in the past, the<br />\nvoice of sanity amidst the braying of Jackels.<br /><br />\n***************<br /><br />\n0000<br /><br />\n******<br /><br />\nThe man to run the Hopkins<br />\nmust be, first and foremost, an<br />\nable administrator. He must have<br />\ndemonstrated his ability to lead<br />\nmen and to stir them to action.<br />\nHe must be acquainted with the<br />\nmysteries of finance and last, but<br />\nperhaps most important, he must<br />\nbe a man of great national respect and<br />\nprestige, prestige<br />\nwhich would spill over to the<br />\nUniversity. In short, he must<br />\nhave all the attributes one seeks<br />\nin a man worthy of the presidency, not of the University, but of<br />\nthis great nation. He must be a<br />\nwinning personality. To this end,<br />\nthe News-Letter puts forth as<br />\nits candidate the Great Kansas<br />\nSunflower, Alf Landon.<br />\nA man forsakened by his nation, scorned by his society, Landon, 76, is in fact, a diamond in<br />\nthe rough, his talents too long<br />\nhidden under a bushel.

The choosing of any<br />\nman other than Landon for this<br />\njob would have to be viewed as<br />\na show of bad faith on the part<br />\nof the trustees.
