Clinchy observed that,<br />\njudging from the experience of<br />\nhistory, the group which has the<br />\nmost number of adherents is most<br />\nlikely to express a cruel intolerance toward the other groups. But<br />\nin America, he said, this is entirely contrary to that tolerance<br />\nwhich is generally considered the<br />\nspirit of the nation.<br />\nIn this city, Rabbi Lazaron asserted, there are forty-five thousand<br />\nfamilis in digtress, and the municipal relief will soon be abandoned.

Some of<br />\nthe ideas then advanced are as<br />\nfollows: there is prejudice against<br />\nthe Jews because they are associated with radical movements,<br />\nambitious and over-forward, and<br />\nregarded as inferior; prejudice is<br />\ninculcated in the education of<br />\nChristians; and lastly, many<br />\nagreed that, though they disliked<br />\nJews as a race, still they thought<br />\nhighly of them as individuals and<br />\nfriends.<br />\n<br />\nDelliolay Club Dance<br />\nToFeatureRamblers Electrical<br />\nFeaturing the music of the<br />\nRamblers, the Johns Hopkins De-,<br />\nMolay Club will hold an open<br />\ndance tomorrow night at Levering Hall.

And since<br />\nwe suggest the idea, we take the liberty to propose the<br />\nfollowing titles as suitable for these curricula: \"The<br />\nArt of Growing Up\" and \"An Appreciation for the<br />\nRights of Others\". Neither course would find itself<br />\nlacking in disciples, and, in the face of the events<br />\nalluded to, both would react, immeasurably to the<br />\nbenefit of the Hopkins.<br />\nIncident Number 1, which indicated prospective<br />\nmembers for both courses, directly concerns the minor<br />\nfire which broke out in the Dorms on Wednesday.<br />\nThe authorities, believing themselves prepared for<br />\nsuch an emergency, quickly and confidently sought<br />\nthe fire extinguishers. Imagine their consternation<br />\nand anger to find that some of the extinguishers had<br />\nbeen removed and concealed by some just-too-clever,<br />\nducky-wucicy students, and that the few which resided in their proper places had been rendered ineffective by these same oh-so-cunning individuals,<br />\nwho had emptied them of their original contents and<br />\nrefilled them with water. As a result, many innocent<br />\nresidents saw damage done to their property before<br />\nthe blaze could be put out.<br />\nThis is not the first instance of such infantile<br />\nconduct emanating from the Dorms; on the contrary,<br />\nit is merely a typical example of the unruly behavior<br />\nwhich predominates at times. It wouldn't be so bad<br />\nif the instigators were the ones who felt the effect<br />\nof their pranks, but unfortunately such is not the<br />\ncase. Those in charge have repeatedly attempted to<br />\ncurb this mild form of vandalism by warnings of<br />\nfines and the like, but to no avail. It appears as if<br />\nchildren must play.<br />\nIncident Number 2, though less general in character, is nevertheless fraught with more serious consequences. According to information received from<br />\na most reliable source, three members of the CWA<br />\ncrew, while working alongside the road which runs<br />\npast Latrobe and Maryland Halls, have been hit and<br />\nbadly shaken up by student-driven machines this<br />\nweek.<br />\nEach accident was declared to have been the<br />\nresuit of gross carelessness on the part of the drivers,<br />\nwho were evidently intent upon getting nowhere in<br />\na hurry. In one case the injured individual was forced<br />\nto forego his work for several days. It is our opinion that this group can be cured by a reproach, or, at the<br />\nmost, a reprimand.

And since<br />\nwe suggest the idea, we take the liberty to propose the<br />\nfollowing titles as suitable for these curricula: \"The<br />\nArt of Growing Up\" and \"An Appreciation for the<br />\nRights of Others\". Neither course would find itself<br />\nlacking in disciples, and, in the face of the events<br />\nalluded to, both would react, immeasurably to the<br />\nbenefit of the Hopkins.<br />\nIncident Number 1, which indicated prospective<br />\nmembers for both courses, directly concerns the minor<br />\nfire which broke out in the Dorms on Wednesday.<br />\nThe authorities, believing themselves prepared for<br />\nsuch an emergency, quickly and confidently sought<br />\nthe fire extinguishers. Imagine their consternation<br />\nand anger to find that some of the extinguishers had<br />\nbeen removed and concealed by some just-too-clever,<br />\nducky-wucicy students, and that the few which resided in their proper places had been rendered ineffective by these same oh-so-cunning individuals,<br />\nwho had emptied them of their original contents and<br />\nrefilled them with water. As a result, many innocent<br />\nresidents saw damage done to their property before<br />\nthe blaze could be put out.<br />\nThis is not the first instance of such infantile<br />\nconduct emanating from the Dorms; on the contrary,<br />\nit is merely a typical example of the unruly behavior<br />\nwhich predominates at times. It wouldn't be so bad<br />\nif the instigators were the ones who felt the effect<br />\nof their pranks, but unfortunately such is not the<br />\ncase. Those in charge have repeatedly attempted to<br />\ncurb this mild form of vandalism by warnings of<br />\nfines and the like, but to no avail. It appears as if<br />\nchildren must play.<br />\nIncident Number 2, though less general in character, is nevertheless fraught with more serious consequences. According to information received from<br />\na most reliable source, three members of the CWA<br />\ncrew, while working alongside the road which runs<br />\npast Latrobe and Maryland Halls, have been hit and<br />\nbadly shaken up by student-driven machines this<br />\nweek.<br />\nEach accident was declared to have been the<br />\nresuit of gross carelessness on the part of the drivers,<br />\nwho were evidently intent upon getting nowhere in<br />\na hurry. In one case the injured individual was forced<br />\nto forego his work for several days. It is our opinion that this group can be cured by a reproach, or, at the<br />\nmost, a reprimand. So we refuse them admittance<br />\nto the above-delineated courses and merely urge:<br />\nKindly stop, look, and listen.<br /><br />\nWisdom From Olympus<br />\nThose two august bodies in whose hands the fate<br />\ncampus apparently rests (it seems so superthe<br />\nof<br />\nfluous to name them as the Student Council and the<br />\nStudent Activities Council) certainly slipped up<br />\nwhen they mutually published their reasons for the<br />\nmaintenance of compulsory attendance on the part of<br />\nfreshmen and sophomores at the weekly assemblies.<br />\nTheir statement, to the effect that \"the assembly<br />\nis the only unifying medium left between the underclasses, and the only means by which activities can<br />\npublicize themselves\", was very poorly composed, to<br />\nsay the least.<br />\nIt's hard to imagine any group gathering that is As<br />\npassive and non-conducive to fraternizing as the asassembly.

Certainly not<br />\nmuch furtherance of unity between the two classes is<br />\naccomplished by the procedure.<br />\nAs for the publicizing of activities, we really<br />\ncan't confess to a feeling of intensified interest in the<br />\nMusical Club after having heard its twenty-minute<br />\nprogram at an assembly held\" last month.
