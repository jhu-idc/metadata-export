By 1971, he had<br />\nexposed the South Vietnamese<br />\nprison \"tiger cages\" and been<br />\nkicked out of the country by the<br />\nSaigon government.

The purpose<br />\nof Stone's talk was to provide an<br />\nintroduction to the Symposium's<br />\ntopic: \"Retrospective on the<br />\nSixties,\" and to give an overview<br />\nof the decade as seen by one who<br />\nwas involved in the issues of the<br />\nperiod.<br />\nStone portrayed the 60's as a<br />\ntime of new awareness and<br />\ninterest in global problems. Stone<br />\ncontinually praised the youth of<br />\nthe decade for its sincere interest<br />\nin human conditions. He<br />\ndisagreed with the Symposium<br />\nsubtitle, \"From Camelot to<br />\nChaos,\" for he maintains that the<br />\ndecade left a good basis for<br />\nadvancement and improvement<br />\nin the 70's.<br />\nStone lauded the young<br />\ngeneration of the 1960's for its<br />\ngenuine concern about the<br />\nproblems that plagued the United<br />\nStates and the entire world<br />\nduring the decade. He felt that it<br />\nwas a surge of \"caring\" that<br />\nbrought about the anti-Vietnam<br />\nmovement, the ecology<br />\nmovement and the notion of<br />\nsocial justice with an eye towards<br />\nrestoring minority pride.<br />\nStone was especially vocal in<br />\ncondemning the \"American Junk<br />\nSociety.\" He asserted that the<br />\n\"devotion and passionate pursuit<br />\nof junk\" threatens political and<br />\nsocial stability in the 1970's.<br />\nAccording to Stone, the<br />\npresent decade is in need of a<br />\nnew, earnest movement to<br />\ncombat resource waste.

He<br />\nrecounted several of his<br />\nexperiences.<br />\nAccording to Luce, the people<br />\nof Iran see what is happening in<br />\ntheir country and are becoming<br />\nangered by it. \"During a<br />\ntwenty-minute walk through<br />\nTehran I saw three people<br />\narrested.

The November issue will<br />\ninclude essays on matters outside<br />\nof the University, fiction, poetry,<br />\nphotography and graphics.

Ladies and gentlemen, Student<br />\nCouncil is the primary outlet for student concerns on<br />\ncampus. How dare these indolent knaves not meet for two<br />\nweeks! A consuming indignation, a ferocious anger, an<br />\nirrepressible urge to violent denunciation were rising within,<br />\nwhen; almost as an afterthought, we realized: so the<br />\nCouncil didn't meet for two weeks. Who noticed? Who<br />\ncares?<br />\n<br />\nCore Commences<br />\nThe preliminary outlines of four core course offerings<br />\nnext fall are encouraging, a step in the direction of<br />\nimproving the education of Hopkins undergraduates. A<br />\nbroader and more insightful picture of the world will be<br />\navailable for people who take the new courses.<br />\nAside from their content, the chief advantage of the new<br />\ncourses will be their accessibility. Most of the richest<br />\nofferings now are too technical for anyone who doesn't<br />\nalready possess a good deal of arcane knowledge in the<br />\nfield. The new courses are expressly designed for any<br />\nstudent, no matter what his background. Also, the more<br />\nheterogenous array of students who will form the new<br />\nclasses should alleviate fears of intense competition.<br />\nHumanities and social science students look with horror on<br />\nthe prospect of taking introductory chemistry, which is a<br />\npre-requisite for most science courses.<br />\nThe impact of the new core curriculum program can only<br />\nbe good. But things could be better. Two of the new<br />\ncourses will be limited to 40 students, and one to 25; these<br />\nrestrictions are probably necessary. Still, the number of<br />\nstudents who can take advantage of them will be limited as<br />\nwell.<br />\n$300,000 and a year of study have created a good<br />\nproject. But it is not clear that more such valuble offerings<br />\ncan't be created with a lot less effort. Dr. Michael Hooker's<br />\nPhilosophic Classics course fulfilled much the same role as<br />\nthe new core courses for several years before anyone ever<br />\nheard of a Mellon grant. If the faculty wants to provide<br />\nbasic educational courses, it can. The core curriculum<br />\nproject shows that if the administration wants to motivate<br />\nthe faculty to offer insightful technical courses, it can. The<br />\nnew course offerings are good. More are needed.<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\n<br />\nChaplain's Office Upholds Morals<br />\nBY MARY WATERS<br />\nAND CHRIS TAYLOR<br />\n<br />\nDan Wile's argument for an<br />\n\"apolitical\" Chaplain's Office is<br />\npremised on a combination of<br />\nquestionable assumptions and<br />\nmisrepresented facts. The barrage<br />\nof loaded headlines which<br />\nintroduces Wile's polemic<br />\nforeshadows the often absurd<br />\n\"logic\" of his position. Far from<br />\nmisusing the \"Hopkins Name,\"<br />\nthe Office of the Chaplain is<br />\nlargely responsible for much of<br />\nthe respect and good feeling<br />\nwhich this university commands<br />\nin the Baltimore community and<br />\nbeyond. Rather than address the<br />\nmany complex and often painful<br />\nissues which confront the<br />\nuniversity, Wile would prefer the<br />\nChaplains Office sink in to the<br />\nmore comfortable moral vacuum<br />\nwhich as already enveloped so<br />\nmuch of this institution.<br />\nMr. Wile contends that the<br />\nChaplain's Office should strive to<br />\nraise \"spiritual issues\" and<br />\n\"promote the welfare of our<br />\nfellow man.\" Yet his conception<br />\nof these aims seems exceptionally<br />\nnarrow. For instance Wile<br />\nopposes joint forums by<br />\norganizations such as the<br />\nCommittee to Convert the<br />\nApplied Physics Lab (CCAPL).<br />\nJohns Hopkins is the number one<br />\nuniversity \"defense\" contractor<br />\nin the country. CCAPL attempts<br />\nto focus the attention of the<br />\nHopkins community on the very<br />\nreal moral issues raised by this<br />\ninvolvement as a major weapons<br />\nproducer. Wile clearly does not<br />\nbelieve that questioning our<br />\nuniversity's involvement in the<br />\ndevelopment and mass<br />\nproduction of lethal weapons<br />\n<br />\nhelps to \"promote the good of<br />\nour fellow man.\" Likewise, the<br />\neffort to expose the University's<br />\nprofitable investments in South<br />\nAfrica is equally irrelevant to<br />\nWile's sterile conception of this<br />\nnoble goal of promoting human<br />\nwelfare.<br />\nBeyond his objection to the<br />\nChaplain raising such \"irrelevant\"<br />\nand \"political\" issues, Wile<br />\ncondemns the manner in which<br />\nthese issues are presented. Wile's<br />\ndescription of the Chaplains<br />\nOffice \"brazenly proselytizng\"'<br />\nlarge numbers of Hopkins<br />\nstudents through messianic rallies<br />\nwhich prevent them from<br />\nevaluating the reasons behind the<br />\narguments presented, is ludicrous<br />\nand almost comic. In fact, Dr.<br />\nWickwire is often a lonely voice<br />\non campus striving to remind us<br />\nof the tragic conditions which<br />\nconfront so much of humanity.<br />\nPopular acceptance has never<br />\nbeen a precondition for Dr.<br />\nWickwire, or his staff, as they<br />\nhave tried to carry out this much<br />\nneeded function. For instance,<br />\nDr. Wickwire spoke out against<br />\nour nation's responsiblitiy for the<br />\ncarnage in Southeast Asia, long<br />\nbefore the war was generally<br />\nperceived as wrong. Whether one<br />\npersonally agrees with Dr.<br />\nWickwire is not at issue. What is<br />\nimportant however, is that these<br />\nproblems are brought to our<br />\nattention. For how can we<br />\npossibley strive to \"promote the<br />\ngood of our fellow man\" if we<br />\nrefuse to ask the central<br />\nquestions of the human<br />\ncondition simply because moral<br />\nchoices are too \"gooey\" and<br />\noften painful. How much simpler<br />\nto sit \"passively\" while being<br />\n\"exposed\" to the \"carefully<br />\n<br />\ncoordinated\" presentations of<br />\nthe University's Office of Public<br />\nRelations. In the past the<br />\nAdministration has demonstrated<br />\nsuch moral foresight and has so<br />\nbrilliantly promoted the \"good<br />\nname\" of our university by such<br />\n\"apolitical\" acts as granting an<br />\nhonorary humanities degree to<br />\nthe daughter of the progressive<br />\nShah of Iran. One shudders at<br />\nWile's Orwellian vision of a<br />\nuniversity where all the<br />\n\"difficult\" moral questions are<br />\npresented in a \"carefully<br />\ncoordinated\" fashion by Garland<br />\nHall.<br />\nIn addition to Mr. Wile's<br />\ndubious assumptions, his case<br />\nrests on a collection of<br />\nmisrepresented facts which bring<br />\nhis intellectual integrity seriously<br />\ninto question. For instance Mr.<br />\nWile charges that \"Many groups<br />\n(he is only able to name two,<br />\nCCAPL and the New Political<br />\nCaucus) whose meetings are<br />\nco-sponsored by the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice are apparently composed<br />\nlargely of outsiders,...\" While we<br />\nare not familiar with the<br />\nmembership roll of the CCAPL<br />\n<br />\nwe can report that there is not<br />\none member of the<br />\nNew Political Caucus (NPC)<br />\nwho is not directly connected<br />\nwith this university. Wile also<br />\nreports that the recent apartheid<br />\nforum, co-sponsored by the<br />\nChaplain's Office and the NPC<br />\n\"... showed films produced by<br />\norganizations of questionable<br />\nobjectivity.\" Of the two films<br />\nMr. Wile is speaking about, the<br />\nfirst, \"Last Grave at Dimbaza\"<br />\nwas largely financed by a number<br />\nof American denominations, at<br />\nthe national level, and is most<br />\n<br />\nCont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\nDavid And Goliath letters to the editor<br />\nSo far this year, the Hopkins' football team has failed to<br />\nattract much notice.

Glenn Beall: Is He Statehouse Material?<br />\nBY ROBERT R. RIGGS AND MARK J. SHUSTED<br />\nJ. Glenn Beall served one term<br />\nas a Republican United States<br />\nSenator from Maryland between<br />\n1971 and 1977. Prior to that, he<br />\nwas Minority Leader in the State<br />\nHouse of Delegates from 1963 to<br />\n1968, and a US. Representative<br />\nfrom 1969 until 1971.<br />\nNews-Letter: What are the main<br />\nissues in this campaign?<br />\nJ. Glenn Beall: Well, I think the<br />\nmain issues in this campaign are<br />\ntaxes, the crime issue; economic<br />\ndevelopment is a very topical<br />\nissue in Maryland because we've<br />\nhad. a net loss of 41,000<br />\nmanufacturing jobs in this state<br />\nin the years 1971 to 1975.<br />\nI think the management of the<br />\ngovernment is a principal issue.<br />\nWho can best provide the<br />\naggressive, firm leadership that is<br />\nnecessary to apply some fiscal<br />\ndiscipline and at hte same time<br />\nmove this state ahead with spirit<br />\nand vitality, because we're a state<br />\nthat's rich in human and natural<br />\nresources and I think we're going<br />\nto have to have someone who is<br />\ngoing to convince the people that<br />\nthey have a lot to be proud of<br />\nabout being Marylanders and<br />\ntherefore earn the respect of the<br />\npeople of this state in their<br />\ngovernment by having the spirit<br />\nand vitality that is necessary to<br />\nconvince them that they are<br />\ngetting their dollar's worth out of<br />\nthe government for the dollar<br />\nthey pay in taxes.<br />\n<br />\nthreat--and I think we should<br />\nrespond to it even though<br />\nMaryland can't have Proposition<br />\n13 because of the nature of our<br />\nConstitution--then we have to<br />\nlimit the amount of revenues<br />\navailable to government. We have<br />\nto make sure that the money that<br />\nis being spent by government is<br />\nspent in a way so that the public<br />\nis convinced that the services of<br />\ngovernment are being delivered in<br />\nan effective, efficient and<br />\neconomical way.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel corruption<br />\nremains a primary issue for<br />\nMaryland politics?<br />\nBeall: According to the polls, it is<br />\nnot. But on the other hand, I<br />\nthink the public wants to respect<br />\nthose people who are in<br />\ngovernment and therefore I think<br />\nthat the people who would lead<br />\nthe government should have to<br />\nconduct the government in an<br />\nopen fashion and I think the best<br />\nway to convince the public that<br />\nwhat's being done is being done<br />\nfor their own good is to make<br />\nsure the government process is<br />\nopen and I think one of the<br />\nproblems we've had in this state<br />\nresults from the fact that the<br />\nlines have been too tightly drawn<br />\naround the statehouse in.<br />\nAnnapolis. There hasn't been<br />\nenough outreach to get people<br />\nfrom outside the political sphere<br />\ninvolved in the governmental<br />\nprocess.<br />\n<br />\nCandidate Beall in a rare garrulous moment.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of<br />\nProposition 13 in California and<br />\ntile so-called tax revolt?<br />\nBeall: Well, I think that<br />\nProposition 13 is indicative ofi<br />\nthe problem we have. Proposition<br />\n13, I contend, is an indication on<br />\nthe part of the public not that<br />\nthey are anxious to quit paying<br />\ntaxes but that they are concerned<br />\nthat they aren't getting their<br />\ndollar's worth of value out of the<br />\ndollar they pay in taxes. They<br />\nthink their money is being<br />\nwasted, and that services are<br />\nbeing duplicated. Therefore, if<br />\nwe're going to respond to this<br />\n<br />\nI believe you have to open up.<br />\nI believe in sunshine laws. I've<br />\nalways been an advocate at the<br />\nfederal level of sunshine laws and<br />\nI think that to the extent'<br />\npossible decisions ought to be<br />\nmade in public. In that way you<br />\ndon't pose the threat of<br />\ncorruption. Obviously, you have<br />\nto be ever-watchful of people in<br />\ngovernment to make sure they're<br />\nconducting themselves in a<br />\nthoroughly honest way.<br />\nN-L: What policy do you favor<br />\non state aid to higher education,<br />\nincluding specifically scholarship<br />\nprograms such as the SSIG?<br />\n<br />\nBeall: Well, I think the one fault<br />\nI find in Maryland's scholarship<br />\nprogram is that we still have a<br />\ncertain number of political<br />\nscholarships in the state. I think<br />\nas soon as we can if it's<br />\npolitically possible we ought to<br />\ndo away with the so-called<br />\nSenatorial scholarships. I think<br />\nscholarships ought to be awarded<br />\non the basis of need and merit,<br />\nand not on the basis of personal<br />\nfriendship. I think that's the way<br />\nour scholarship program ought to<br />\nbe designed.<br />\nAs far as overall aid to higher<br />\neducation is concerned, I think<br />\nthe state has to be alert to the<br />\nnecessity of making sure that<br />\ncollege is always an attainable<br />\ngoal for those people who want<br />\nto take advantage of an<br />\neducational opportunity<br />\nregardless of their income or<br />\nsocial status. I think therefore<br />\nyou should have loan programs<br />\nand scholarship programs readily<br />\navailable for those people who<br />\nneed them.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of the<br />\nconditions and prospects of the<br />\nRepublican party nationwide?<br />\nHas it recovered from Watergate?<br />\nBeall: The condition hasn't been<br />\ntoo good; the prospects are<br />\nb etter. The condition is<br />\nimproving. I know Senator<br />\nBrock very well, who is chairman<br />\nof the Republican National<br />\nCommittee. As a matter of fact, I<br />\ntalked to him the day before<br />\nyesterday. He and I served in the<br />\nUnited States Senate together.<br />\nHe has an appreciation of what<br />\nwe call nuts and bolts activities.<br />\nThis means you have to go out in<br />\nthe grass roots and organize<br />\npeople where they live and get<br />\nthem interested in the<br />\ngovernmental process and<br />\npolitical process. The<br />\nRepublicans have not reached<br />\nout enough into the community.<br />\nI think the Republicans have had<br />\ngood programs but they haven't<br />\nconvinced the people of the<br />\ncountry that these were the<br />\nprograms that were for their<br />\ngood. I think you will find now<br />\nthat Democrats are coming<br />\naround and embracing<br />\nRepublican programs.<br />\nThe mood of economy and<br />\nefficiency of government is<br />\nsomething the Republicans have<br />\nbeen talking about for a large<br />\nnumber of years. When I was in<br />\nWashington I used to constantly<br />\nargue with Senator Mondale who<br />\nsat across the table from me on<br />\nthe Budget Committee about<br />\nhow we ought to spend the<br />\npublic's money. I was the guy<br />\nwho was on what I considered to<br />\nbe the efficient, effective<br />\ngovernment side and he was of<br />\nthe philosophy that you solved<br />\nall of the peoples' problems by<br />\nthrowing more money at them.<br />\nBut now these guys are reversing<br />\ntheir field. The public's caught<br />\nup with this philosophy and<br />\ndoesn't like it any more and<br />\nthey're coming around and<br />\nsaying,\"Oh, we have to do things<br />\ndifferent ways.\" This is what<br />\nRepublicans have been saying.<br />\nTherefore I think it's incumbent<br />\nupon Republicans to convince<br />\nthe public that this is indeed the<br />\ncase.<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nC.hgca 19<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\nco<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\nN-L: Do you see Richard Nixon<br />\nassuming the role of elder<br />\nstatesman in the Republican<br />\nparty?<br />\nBeall: No.<br />\nN-L: What measures should be<br />\ntaken to relieve prison<br />\novercrowding?<br />\nBeall: Obviously, the immediate<br />\nmeasure that should be taken is<br />\nproviding more prison beds.<br />\nThat's a very simplistic answer;<br />\nunfortunately, the building of a<br />\nprison in Maryland has become a<br />\npolitical football and decisions<br />\nthat should have been made a<br />\n'couple of years ago and a prison<br />\nthat should have been built by<br />\nnow remains to be built. The<br />\ndecision still hasn't finally been<br />\nmade. I believe it's very<br />\nregrettable. It has certainly been<br />\na black eye on the part of those<br />\npeople who have been in charge<br />\nof the government that this has<br />\nbeen allowed to happen.<br />\nI think that the prison ought<br />\nto be built downtown in<br />\nBaltimore next to the existing<br />\npenitentiary and I think it's the<br />\nresponsibility of the Governor to<br />\nget together with the corrections<br />\nofficials, planners, engineers, and<br />\nothers and suggest to them that<br />\n\"this is where we're going to<br />\nbuild the prison, now come up<br />\nwith a viable plan that's going to<br />\nserve the purposes for which it is<br />\nbeing built in an effective way.\"<br />\n<br />\nN-L: Did the Sunpapers make<br />\nHarry Hughes?<br />\nBeall: Yes. I don't think he<br />\n<br />\nwould have won the primary had<br />\nit not been for that endorsement.<br />\nN-L: What effect will media<br />\nendorsements have on the<br />\ncampaign in the general election?<br />\nBeall: It remains to be seen. I<br />\ndon't know. Actually, if you are<br />\nendorsed by the media you make<br />\nall of it that you can. If you<br />\naren't, you downplay it as much<br />\nas possible. So it depends on<br />\nwhen and how strongly the<br />\nendorsements come. Obviously in<br />\nthe primary it was a major factor<br />\nbecause the endorsement came so<br />\nearly and gave credibility to a<br />\ncandidate who wasn't being<br />\nconsidered seriously up to that<br />\ntime. The endorsement came<br />\nfour weeks in advance of the<br />\nelection. Obviously there was<br />\nplenty of time for people to react<br />\nto that endorsement. If the<br />\nendorsement had come the<br />\nnormal one week before the<br />\nelection it probably wouldn't<br />\nhave had that kind of impact.<br />\nN-L: Most media attention was<br />\nfocused on the Democratic<br />\nchallengers prior to the primary<br />\nelection. Will the late primary<br />\nhurt your chances?<br />\nBeall: I think it helps our<br />\nchances. I've always been in favor<br />\nof a late primary. It does a<br />\ncouple of things. First of all it<br />\nmakes the elections cheaper. You<br />\nknow one of the problems you<br />\nhave in running for office these<br />\ndays is raising sufficient funds.<br />\nI've always been in favor of<br />\nshortening these elections in our<br />\nCont. on p. 7<br />\n<br />\nJ.

I read in the paper<br />\ntoday of the tremendous cost of<br />\nthe Democratic primary. I think<br />\nif there is a short space of time in<br />\nwhich we have the campaigns it<br />\ndoes reduce the cost.<br />\nI think you're better able to<br />\nkeep the public's attention.<br />\nthink this primary has been going<br />\non for the last year; the public<br />\nreally didn't get into it until<br />\nabout the last two weeks. In a<br />\ngeneral election campaign,<br />\nhowever, when you have two<br />\npeople running, one against the<br />\nother, and presumably you have<br />\nsome opposing philosophies and<br />\nideologies, then I think you can<br />\nreally attract the public's<br />\nattention. I think we have an<br />\neight-week period this year<br />\nbetween the primary and the<br />\ngeneral election. I think that's<br />\nfine. I think that helps me rather<br />\nthan hurts me because so far I've<br />\nbeen the one who's talking about<br />\nthe issues and I'm waiting for my<br />\nopponent to suggest what he's<br />\ngoing to do if he's elected<br />\nGovernor of Maryland and even<br />\nthough he's had a year to talk<br />\nabout all of this he hasn't talked<br />\nabout it yet. Because we're<br />\nspeaking specifically and he's<br />\nspeaking generally I think it's<br />\ncoming to my benefit.<br />\nN-L: Can you relate to Baltimore<br />\nCity and its problems sufficiently<br />\nto attract its voters?<br />\nBeall: I'm from Western<br />\nMaryland, out in Allegheny<br />\ncounty. Although I've lived in<br />\nthe Washington area in recent<br />\nyears because I was in the federal<br />\ngovernment, I certainly think I<br />\ncan relate to Baltimore city and<br />\nits problems because sometimes<br />\nyou're better off looking at<br />\nproblems from outside than<br />\ninside. You will note that the<br />\nBaltimore Sun the day before<br />\nyesterday had an editorial that<br />\ncommented on the good things<br />\nhad been involved in for<br />\nBaltimore City when I was<br />\nUnited States Senator. These<br />\nincluded some area<br />\nredevelopment downtown; it<br />\nincluded the preservation of the<br />\nPublic Health Service Hospital<br />\nover here just off the campus. I<br />\nwas instrumental in having the<br />\nSocial Security Building built<br />\ndowntown, and I am also very<br />\nconcerned about the<br />\ndevelopment of the port in doing<br />\nthose things that are necessary to<br />\nmaintain this port in a<br />\ncompetitive position in<br />\ncomparison to ports up and<br />\ndown the Eastern seaboard. I<br />\nthink I have a very good<br />\n<br />\nperception of Baltimore's<br />\nproblems as a result of my<br />\nprevious service and even though<br />\nI don't live here, and because I<br />\ndon't live here, I'm in a better<br />\nposition to evaluate the<br />\nproblems, put a priority on them,<br />\nand do something about them.<br />\nOne of the problems we've had<br />\nin this state results from the fact<br />\nthat people in government in the<br />\npast have tended to pit Baltimore<br />\nagainst the state, and vice versa. I<br />\nthink, as I said earlier, that we're<br />\na state that is rich in human and<br />\nmaterial resources and we ought<br />\nto build on each other's<br />\nstrengths rather than emphasize<br />\neach other's weaknesses. I think<br />\nit's the job of a governor to build<br />\na bridge between the various<br />\nregions of this state and I think<br />\nbecause I don't come from<br />\nBaltimore I can convince people<br />\noutside of Baltimore that<br />\nBaltimore is indeed the single<br />\nmost important economic factor<br />\nin our state. Baltimore is the<br />\neconomic hub of our state and<br />\ntherefore people who don't live<br />\nin our state will have to be<br />\nconcerned about the economic<br />\nand social viability of this city.<br />\nN-L: Later this year, the Colts<br />\nplay the Redskins. Who will you<br />\nrootfor?<br />\nBeall: Well, I think I would wish<br />\n.both of them success.<br />\nN-L: And if the score should be<br />\ntied after four quarters with<br />\novertime resulting?<br />\nBeall: I have fondness for each of<br />\nthese teams. At.one time I held<br />\nseason tickets to both teams but<br />\nI had to give that up because I<br />\ncouldn't afford that. So I gave<br />\nthem both up, as a matter of<br />\n<br />\nfact. Then when I went to<br />\nWashington I got season tickets<br />\nfor the Redskins' games because I.<br />\nhappen to be closer, but more<br />\nrecently I've been going to some<br />\nCults' games. I don't think it's<br />\nnecessary to take Sides even<br />\nthough I must admit I have a<br />\nlittle bit of partiality for the<br />\nColts.<br />\nN-L: Final question. The<br />\noverwhelming mnjority of voters<br />\nin Maryland are registered<br />\nDemocrats. Who is going to vote<br />\nfor you?<br />\nBeall: A lot of those<br />\nDemocrats , and let me answer<br />\nthat question quite seriously.<br />\nLook at the Democratic primary.<br />\nAlthough the Republicans only<br />\nhave 20% of the registered voters,<br />\nin the Democratic primary, only<br />\n40% of those people registered as<br />\nDemocrats took the trouble to<br />\nvote, and of those who voted<br />\nonly 37% voted for the winner.

During the<br />\nsummer of his junior year, he worked as an intern for the<br />\nSunpapers; he then worked as a stringer his junior and<br />\nsenior years. After his graduation Hill became a county<br />\nreporter for the Sun; he was later promoted to feature<br />\nwriter and,finally, T.V.

In previous years he joined the<br />\npractices in an effort to prepare for his own participation<br />\nin distance races.<br />\n\"I had been out with the team for a couple of years,<br />\nand on the NL I worked on the sports coverage.

If I<br />\nhad to turn them into marathoners, it would not be so hard<br />\nas having one month to train them to run six miles.<br />\n\"I started running in high school. I was very slow, but I<br />\ndid have an interest in distance running. While I was in<br />\nschool at Hopkins, I was in a state of physical<br />\ndegeneration. But I started playing pick-up basketball in<br />\nmy junior year. I started running in December 1973, after<br />\nI saw my first marathon. I said that I'd run one the next<br />\nyear. Actually, I ran one ten months later, the New York<br />\nCity marathon in 3:23. Then I ran the Maryland<br />\nMarathon in 2:58, Boston in 2:45, and that year I also ran<br />\n<br />\ntwo 50 mile races. My best marathon was the Marine Corp<br />\nMarathon last November. I finished 37th with a time of<br />\n2:34.<br />\n\"I think that I started because it was the only sport I<br />\ncould be decent in. I'm not quick, I can't jump. I have the<br />\nright body build, but it's amazing, I never thought I'd<br />\nhave the discipline.\"<br />\nThroughout the history of the Hopkins undergraduate<br />\nsome things have remained the same. There will always be<br />\na high,level of academic performance and a corresponding<br />\nstability, both of which the school fosters.<br />\n\"The things which have remained the same here is that<br />\nthe students don't get led into trouble. They have always<br />\nthought about things first. In the Sixties all of us did<br />\nthings against the war. We were all rich white kids. We<br />\ncould have gotten out of the draft if we had to. We did<br />\nthings because we thought they were right. It was a spirit<br />\nwhich flourished here at a place like Hopkins, and that's<br />\njust not present here anymore. It's just not in the air like<br />\nit used to be.<br />\n\"Jobs weren't that easy, but we knew that things<br />\nwould work themselves out. There was a war going on,<br />\nthings to be done, a News-Letter to get out. And for most<br />\nof us it did work out.<br />\n\"That's why I'm surprised, with running being such a<br />\nbig thing, that we don't have more people out for the<br />\nteam. It's a product of the grade consciousness. It's a<br />\nshame really. People are missing doing something they<br />\nenjoy. You're only going to be in college once.

The water comes out of<br />\nthese cannons at tremendous<br />\nspeeds and it knocked the nuns<br />\ndown and spun them over and<br />\nover along the ground.<br />\n\"Then policemen started<br />\nbeating the students.

I<br />\nremember that with their soaked<br />\nhabits clinging to their tiny<br />\nbodies, they looked like birds in<br />\nan oil slick.\"<br />\nLuce also spoke about the<br />\ngovernment in Taiwan. \"People<br />\ndon't hear much about the<br />\ngovernment in Shanghai--we tend<br />\nto think that problems in Taiwan<br />\nshould be handled by the people<br />\n<br />\nthemselves.

Although he was not<br />\nallowed to take pictures or speak<br />\nto workers, he was given a guided<br />\ntour of one factory by its<br />\nmanager. This man told Luce<br />\nthat the only men in the factories<br />\nare police and managers.<br />\nAccording to this individual,<br />\nfactories exclusively employ<br />\nyoung girls because \"they are<br />\nmore docile and obedient than<br />\n<br />\nboys, and they work cheaper.\"<br />\nLuce estimates the average salary<br />\nof a Taiwanese factory worker is<br />\n$50 a month, as compared with<br />\n$900 per month for similar work<br />\nin the United States. According<br />\nto him, U.S. multinationals must<br />\nsave $5.1 million a year by<br />\noperating out of Taiwan on labor<br />\nalone.<br />\nLuce spoke with several<br />\nworkers. \"I met one girl who had<br />\na finger cut off by a factory<br />\nmachine. In the United States she<br />\ncould have sued the company for<br />\na million dollars. In Taiwan all<br />\nshe got was bus fare home.\" He<br />\ncontinued: \"When the factories<br />\nsuffered a labor shortage<br />\nrecently, the President of Taiwan<br />\nobligingly closed down the<br />\nschools a month early.\"<br />\nAfter closing his talk with a<br />\npoem written by a Vietnamese<br />\npolitical prisoner, Luce<br />\nresponded to questions from the<br />\naudience.

Marshall), the head of the family, is the<br />\nonly character who is not driven by an artist's<br />\ninner-vision. Eve (Geraldine Page), the mother of this<br />\ntalented brood, is an interior designer. Of her three<br />\ndaughters, Renata (Diane Keaton), the oldest, is a poet<br />\nwho has married a novelist incapable of accepting or<br />\ncompeting with his wife's success; Flyn (Kristin Griffith),<br />\nan aspiring actress who has come to an impasse in her<br />\ncareer; and the youngest daughter, Joey (Marybeth Hurt)<br />\nhas the spirit of an artist but is lacking an outlet for her<br />\ncreativity. (This is eventually resolved because Interiors is<br />\nher creation, a product of her own unique vision).<br />\nCont. on p.15<br />\n<br />\nWoody Allen's first attempt at a serious movie,<br />\nInteriors, is clumsy, mawkish, cliche-ridden and, above all,<br />\nstagnant. Hopelessly melodramatic, the film is a parody of<br />\nitself.<br />\nThe plot is simple: three sisters, all living away from<br />\nhome, react strongly to the news of their parents.<br />\nseparation and subsequent divorce. When the father<br />\ndecides to remarry, mama disintegrates. And during the<br />\nhoneymoon at the family beach house, (with all three<br />\nsisters in attendance), tht Rejected Wife arrives<br />\nunexpectedly, stands motionless in the doorway for five<br />\nminutes listening to her favorite daughter castigate her for<br />\nher sins, then walks slowly and solemnly into the ocean,<br />\ndrowning without a word.'<br />\nOf course, the sisters (Diane Keaton, Kristin<br />\nGriffith and Marybeth Hurt) each have problems of their<br />\n<br />\nIptertaimpept<br />\n<br />\nOlufunmilayo<br />\nrhe Muffins<br />\n<br />\nown. The eldest (Keaton) leads a particularly tortuous<br />\nexistence: successful as a writer herself, she must<br />\nconstantly reassure her alcoholic novelist husband<br />\n(Richard Jordan) that she does not consider him a failure.<br />\nHe refuses to accept her encouragement and,<br />\noverwhelmed by his creative agony, tries unsuccessfully to<br />\nseduce the younger sister (Griffith), saying, \"I haven't<br />\nmade love to a woman I didn't feel inferior to for six<br />\nyears.\"<br />\nSo much for the action. What's wrong with this film?<br />\nSimply put, Interiors is nothing but a large, abortive<br />\ncliche. The trauma of separation, the fragility of family<br />\nties, the destructive competitiveness of spouses working in<br />\nthe same field--these are all familiar, overworked themes.<br />\nThat doesn't mean they shouldn't be explored--but Allen<br />\ntreats his subject matter with all the subtlety of King<br />\nKong.<br />\nCryptic statements. Cutting replies. Pregnant pauses.<br />\nEmotional tirades. All mixed together,against a<br />\nbackground of bare scenery, innumerable close-ups and<br />\nabrupt scene changes.<br />\nAt one point, the camera focuses on Keaton's hand,<br />\npen to paper. The hand crosses out one word, substitutes<br />\nanother, crosses that one out, substitutes another, then<br />\nsuddenly crumples up the paper and flings it aside.<br />\nWriting is torture. Only I saw exactly the same scene in<br />\nJulia last summer, and it didn't work then, either.<br />\nAnother example of Allen's clumsiness is illustrated by<br />\nthe photo which appears on this page. Here in the<br />\nNews-Letter it doesn't seem so bad; but imagine seeing it<br />\n(and another, similar wedding shot) prolonged for 20<br />\nseconds on the screen while all three actresses strain to<br />\navoid batting an eyelash. It's nauseatingly trite.<br />\nPerhaps Allen's problem is that he is reacting too<br />\nstrongly against his own comic heritage. Determined to<br />\nmake a serious film, he ends up just being grim. All the<br />\ncharacters in Interiors are tight-lipped. Stern. Forbidding.<br />\nThey stalk purposefully across the screen, eyes dead<br />\nahead, jaws locked. None of them show any signs of<br />\nhaving a sense of humor.<br />\nThis kind of apocalyptic intensity is nearly impossible<br />\nto sustain, and once it's been disrupted each new catharsis<br />\nis not moving--only comical.<br />\nIn fact, as I was leaving the theater a man behind me<br />\nsaid to his wife,\"That's the funniest Allen movie I've ever<br />\nseen.\" While I would have to disagree with his analysis<br />\n(personally 1 prefer Bananas) his point is well taken: Allen<br />\nshould stick to comedy.<br />\n<br />\nBetween The Lines<br />\n<br />\nA Generation<br />\ntaw int MOP 4<br />\n<br />\nIN _<br />\n7M5<br />\n414AF<br />\n,40.,7 144<br />\nC\u00b0Nt<br />\n46<br />\n441 RAW,<br />\nir.7<br />\n01441 ralr<br />\n/1.ag<br />\n41<br />\nMilt I0V4 6N<br />\nMY mei PU.0( AN<br />\nOa,A mut.<br />\nf. ,.,<br />\n0A<br />\n.<br />\n,...D.

Buckley, Jr. adds distinction<br />\nand delightful irony. According to Buckley, \"Those in<br />\nsearch of the meaning of humane letters need go no<br />\nfurther than to Doonesbury.\" The era of the socially<br />\nconscious comic strip has arrived.<br />\n\"Doonesbury\" began in the early seventies as an<br />\nextension of Trudeau's campus comic strip for the Yale<br />\nnewspaper. The gags centered around a few students at a<br />\nNew England university. Typical humor was Mike ineptly<br />\ntrying to make it with a dumb blonde. With Watergate,<br />\n\"Doonesbury\" found itself at the right place at the right<br />\ntime - and exploited the opportunity. Many Americans<br />\nstopped reading the double-talk on the front pages and<br />\nturned inward to the tongue-in-cheek honesty of this<br />\ncomic strip. Trudeau made the cover of Time and won a<br />\nPulitzer prize.<br />\nSince that time \"Doonesbury's\" cast of characters has<br />\nexpanded and shifted emphasis, but the old crew still<br />\nremains.

This made me anticipate a<br />\nsurrealistic experience; I expected musical conventions<br />\nwould be exploded. But while the explosion of The<br />\nMuffins was loud, it was not always on target. Still,<br />\nalthough The Muffins will probably never catch on<br />\ncommercially, theirs is an art form that should be listened<br />\nto and reckoned with.<br />\nThat is exactly what Monday night's audience in the<br />\nL-V room did. In sharp contrast to Dada audiences in the<br />\nearly part of this century who were prone to riotous<br />\ndisturbances, the Muffins' crowd of 70 people was very<br />\nreceptive.<br />\nThe make-up of the band is similar to that of a<br />\ntraditional jazz quartet. Tom Scott (not of the L.A.<br />\nExpress) plays many varied wind instruments, including<br />\nclarinets, saxophones and flutes. Dave Newhouse plays<br />\nelectric piano and synthesizer, and doubles on some wind<br />\ninstruments. These two musicians are supported by Billy<br />\nSwann on bass and Paul Sears on percussion. The band<br />\noriginated four years ago, and are based in Rockville,<br />\nMaryland. They have released four albums, and have more<br />\non the way. These albums have a very strong international<br />\nreputation, especially in England, but their following in<br />\nAmerica is not as large. Last Sunday, though, at the Zoo<br />\nFestival for International New Music in New York, The<br />\nMuffins received the greatest response from a crowd that<br />\nincluded 'everyone' in progressive music.<br />\nTheir concert Monday night also was worthy of<br />\nattention. The Muffins were best when their music was<br />\n'traditional', when it had a beat. (A supporter of<br />\nprogressive music would claim that this is the<br />\nnarrow-minded opinion of one who cannot accept music<br />\n<br />\nAi TIN<br />\n<br />\nthat is devoid of conventional forms.) The music was<br />\nmost pleasing when the bass, drums and keyboards<br />\ncreated a strong underlying structure onto which the<br />\nmelodies of the wind instruments were layered, resulting<br />\nin an expansive textural complexity. The melodies were<br />\nmost effective when they were either lyrical, or repeated<br />\nrunning scales or arpeggios. When there was a method or<br />\npattern to their explosions, The Muffins were able to<br />\nbreak down the traditional forms of music and make their<br />\n<br />\nown musical statements that were both communicative<br />\nand surreal.<br />\nThe Muffins were at their worst when they seemed to<br />\nfire at will. These moments consisted of attacks on<br />\nstrange instruments and percussives, resulting in 'noise'<br />\nthat was totally absent of pattern . All their music is<br />\ncompletely scored, and it was obvious they were not<br />\nimprovising, but the effect on the listener was one of<br />\ncomplete disorientation with the music.<br />\nThe most commercially successful band The Muffins<br />\ncould be compared to is Return To Forever. This is<br />\ncertainly an insult to The Muffins, though, because<br />\nalthough they may not be as polished or professional,<br />\ntheir music is much more interesting. The band could also<br />\nbe compared with Robert Fripp and Brian Eno. They are<br />\nnot necessarily working in jazz, but they are trying to<br />\nreconsider and to expand the limits of popular music. The<br />\nmusician probably most closely related to The Muffins is<br />\nPhilip Glass. His music has much stronger classical ties,<br />\nbut it contains a similar jazz feel, and also e mploys<br />\nelectronic keyboards and wind instruments. The music of<br />\nPhilip Glass is minimalism in its highest form. He strips all<br />\nthe elements of music bare, layering these simple<br />\nstructures on top of each other for a complex, yet<br />\nhypnotic sound. The Muffins never seem to produce the<br />\nsame trance-like quality, but in many ways they are<br />\nstriving for the same musical goals as Philip Glass.<br />\nThe Muffins' approach to traditional music is not<br />\nnihilistic; they are not trying to destroy all institutions of<br />\nmusical form. Their music is surreal in the sense that they<br />\nare trying to explode musical conventions. But in the end,<br />\ntheir music is simply progressive; they are trying to<br />\nexpand the possibilities of popular music and jazz.<br />\nOccasionally the music misfires, but The Muffins deserve<br />\nattention and an important position on the American<br />\nmusic scene.<br />\n<br />\n's<br />\nIs<br />\nAllen<br />\niors<br />\nInter<br />\nBijou) Introspective Gem<br />\n<br />\nA Generation-- This is the first film in Andrzej<br />\nWadja's informal trilogy dealing with the World War II<br />\n,<br />\nresistance movement.

This interior<br />\nbecomes the film's central metaphor for the inner<br />\nemptiness experienced by the people who inhabit this<br />\nalien landscape. The sterility of bare floors, and white<br />\nhospital rooms flooded by harsh sunlight represents the<br />\ncharacters' inability to express emotions in a practical<br />\nmanner, outside of any artistic craft. Each character<br />\nresists the type of articulate expression of abstract<br />\nemotions which comes so easily when removed and seen<br />\nas art. In this interior, emotions are disciplined by a<br />\npervading atmosphere of rationalism.<br />\nArthur, who is not affected by such inabilities, provides<br />\nthe spark which presents a family conflict. Unable to deal<br />\nwith the frenzy of emotion that Eve has subdued at the<br />\ncost of the rest of the family, he asks for a divorce. From<br />\nthis point on, Eve exists at the apex of a rage which<br />\nremains hidden and controlled. Arthur is eventually<br />\nmarried to Pearl (Maureen Stapleton), a boisterous and<br />\nsensible multi-widowed woman who hasn't the least<br />\ndifficulty with self-expression.<br />\nSimilarly, the sterility of the settings used in each<br />\nscene, and the characters' bland dialogue also create There<br />\nare numerous shots from behind glass windows and at<br />\ntimes the camera pans an empty beach front from behind<br />\nstorm fences. This motif is often used to represent a<br />\nbarrier which can distort perception or simply separate<br />\nthe characters from the rest of the world.<br />\nInteriors is steeped in Bergmanesque traditions and<br />\nlogic. The subject of people who are destroyed by the<br />\nextreme control they exert upon their emotions and their<br />\ninability to project those emotions is a recurring theme in<br />\nBergman's films. Most reminiscent of this difficulty is<br />\nPersona . In this film strict control is used to conceal \"the<br />\nabyss between what we are for others and what we are for<br />\nourselves.\"<br />\nAs in Play it Again, Sam, Woody Allen repeatedly relies<br />\nupon our ability to respond to film cliches and references<br />\nwithout much effort. Consequently, Interiors can appear<br />\nto be a trite, cliche-ridden, runaway metaphor. As with<br />\nBergman's Persona, however, Interiors does not aim to be<br />\nentertaining, but introspective.<br />\nthanthe Sun.<br />\nBut throughout the poingnant social commentary,<br />\n\"Doonesbury\" remains true to the one essential tenet of<br />\ncartooning: entertainment.

By 1971, he had<br />\nexposed the South Vietnamese<br />\nprison \"tiger cages\" and been<br />\nkicked out of the country by the<br />\nSaigon government. His vigorious<br />\nactivity against the war caused<br />\nformer U.S. Ambassador to<br />\nSouth Vietnam Graham Martin,<br />\nin a 1976 Congressional hearing,<br />\nto single out Luce and Frederic<br />\nR. Branfman, another political<br />\nmovement leader, \"for the main<br />\ncredit--or blame--for ending the<br />\nwar.\"<br />\nToday, as International<br />\nDirector for Clergy and Laity<br />\nConcerned, Luce travels around<br />\nthe world investigating violations<br />\nof human rights and speaking to<br /><br />\nStone Presents<br />\nOverview Of<br />\nSixtiesDecade<br />\nBY FELICE EKELNIAN<br />\nThe 1978 Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium opened<br />\non Monday with a speech by I.F.<br />\nStone, journalist and editor of<br />\nStone's Weekly. The purpose<br />\nof Stone's talk was to provide an<br />\nintroduction to the Symposium's<br />\ntopic: \"Retrospective on the<br />\nSixties,\" and to give an overview<br />\nof the decade as seen by one who<br />\nwas involved in the issues of the<br />\nperiod.<br />\nStone portrayed the 60's as a<br />\ntime of new awareness and<br />\ninterest in global problems. Stone<br />\ncontinually praised the youth of<br />\nthe decade for its sincere interest<br />\nin human conditions. He<br />\ndisagreed with the Symposium<br />\nsubtitle, \"From Camelot to<br />\nChaos,\" for he maintains that the<br />\ndecade left a good basis for<br />\nadvancement and improvement<br />\nin the 70's.<br />\nStone lauded the young<br />\ngeneration of the 1960's for its<br />\ngenuine concern about the<br />\nproblems that plagued the United<br />\nStates and the entire world<br />\nduring the decade. He felt that it<br />\nwas a surge of \"caring\" that<br />\nbrought about the anti-Vietnam<br />\nmovement, the ecology<br />\nmovement and the notion of<br />\nsocial justice with an eye towards<br />\nrestoring minority pride.<br />\nStone was especially vocal in<br />\ncondemning the \"American Junk<br />\nSociety.\" He asserted that the<br />\n\"devotion and passionate pursuit<br />\nof junk\" threatens political and<br />\nsocial stability in the 1970's.<br />\nAccording to Stone, the<br />\npresent decade is in need of a<br />\nnew, earnest movement to<br />\ncombat resource waste. He claims<br />\nthat we are in need of a new set<br />\nof social values which exclude<br />\nConspicuous consumption and<br />\narrest our destructive tendency<br />\nto \"work ourselves to death.\" in<br />\norder to have non -necessities.<br />\nOver 800 people heard the<br />\nSymposium's opening speech,<br />\nincluding many from outside the<br />\nUniversity.<br /><br />\nconcerned people. Last Sunday<br />\nhe spoke at the Sunday<br />\nExperience, sponsored by the<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain. The<br />\nsubject was an \"International<br />\nUpdate on Human Rights--A<br />\nRecent Eyewitness Account.\"<br />\nLuce offered opinions on the<br />\npolitical situations in Iran, the<br />\nPhilippines, and Taiwan, and<br />\nspoke on the violation of basic<br />\nhuman rights. \"Those three<br />\ncountries head our dirty dozen<br />\nlist;it also includes South Korea,<br />\nIndonesia, South Africa,<br />\nRhodesia, Argentina, Brazil,<br />\nChile, Uruguay and Haiti. The<br />\nCALC has chosen countries<br />\nwhere the United States is<br />\ndirectly responsible for arms<br />\nsales, investments and direct<br />\nmilitary grants. We try to arouse<br />\nour citizens to end involvement<br />\nwith repressive governments.\"<br />\nThe talk opened with a<br />\ncomparison of the situation in<br />\nVietnam in 1962 with that in<br />\nIran, Taiwan and the Philippines<br />\ntoday. \"Before becoming<br />\ninvolved in the war, Americans<br />\nnever tried to understand<br />\nVietnamese culture. We never<br />\ngave the Vietnamese people<br />\ncredit for wanting education for<br />\ntheir children and decent health<br />\ncare for their families.

Ladies and gentlemen, Student<br />\nCouncil is the primary outlet for student concerns on<br />\ncampus. How dare these indolent knaves not meet for two<br />\nweeks! A consuming indignation, a ferocious anger, an<br />\nirrepressible urge to violent denunciation were rising within,<br />\nwhen; almost as an afterthought, we realized: so the<br />\nCouncil didn't meet for two weeks. Who noticed? Who<br />\ncares?<br /><br />\nCore Commences<br />\nThe preliminary outlines of four core course offerings<br />\nnext fall are encouraging, a step in the direction of<br />\nimproving the education of Hopkins undergraduates. A<br />\nbroader and more insightful picture of the world will be<br />\navailable for people who take the new courses.<br />\nAside from their content, the chief advantage of the new<br />\ncourses will be their accessibility. Most of the richest<br />\nofferings now are too technical for anyone who doesn't<br />\nalready possess a good deal of arcane knowledge in the<br />\nfield. The new courses are expressly designed for any<br />\nstudent, no matter what his background. Also, the more<br />\nheterogenous array of students who will form the new<br />\nclasses should alleviate fears of intense competition.<br />\nHumanities and social science students look with horror on<br />\nthe prospect of taking introductory chemistry, which is a<br />\npre-requisite for most science courses.<br />\nThe impact of the new core curriculum program can only<br />\nbe good. But things could be better. Two of the new<br />\ncourses will be limited to 40 students, and one to 25; these<br />\nrestrictions are probably necessary. Still, the number of<br />\nstudents who can take advantage of them will be limited as<br />\nwell.<br />\n$300,000 and a year of study have created a good<br />\nproject. But it is not clear that more such valuble offerings<br />\ncan't be created with a lot less effort. Dr. Michael Hooker's<br />\nPhilosophic Classics course fulfilled much the same role as<br />\nthe new core courses for several years before anyone ever<br />\nheard of a Mellon grant. If the faculty wants to provide<br />\nbasic educational courses, it can. The core curriculum<br />\nproject shows that if the administration wants to motivate<br />\nthe faculty to offer insightful technical courses, it can. The<br />\nnew course offerings are good. More are needed.<br /><br />\nOpinion<br /><br />\nChaplain's Office Upholds Morals<br />\nBY MARY WATERS<br />\nAND CHRIS TAYLOR<br /><br />\nDan Wile's argument for an<br />\n\"apolitical\" Chaplain's Office is<br />\npremised on a combination of<br />\nquestionable assumptions and<br />\nmisrepresented facts. The barrage<br />\nof loaded headlines which<br />\nintroduces Wile's polemic<br />\nforeshadows the often absurd<br />\n\"logic\" of his position. Far from<br />\nmisusing the \"Hopkins Name,\"<br />\nthe Office of the Chaplain is<br />\nlargely responsible for much of<br />\nthe respect and good feeling<br />\nwhich this university commands<br />\nin the Baltimore community and<br />\nbeyond. Rather than address the<br />\nmany complex and often painful<br />\nissues which confront the<br />\nuniversity, Wile would prefer the<br />\nChaplains Office sink in to the<br />\nmore comfortable moral vacuum<br />\nwhich as already enveloped so<br />\nmuch of this institution.<br />\nMr. Wile contends that the<br />\nChaplain's Office should strive to<br />\nraise \"spiritual issues\" and<br />\n\"promote the welfare of our<br />\nfellow man.\" Yet his conception<br />\nof these aims seems exceptionally<br />\nnarrow. For instance Wile<br />\nopposes joint forums by<br />\norganizations such as the<br />\nCommittee to Convert the<br />\nApplied Physics Lab (CCAPL).<br />\nJohns Hopkins is the number one<br />\nuniversity \"defense\" contractor<br />\nin the country. CCAPL attempts<br />\nto focus the attention of the<br />\nHopkins community on the very<br />\nreal moral issues raised by this<br />\ninvolvement as a major weapons<br />\nproducer. Wile clearly does not<br />\nbelieve that questioning our<br />\nuniversity's involvement in the<br />\ndevelopment and mass<br />\nproduction of lethal weapons<br /><br />\nhelps to \"promote the good of<br />\nour fellow man.\" Likewise, the<br />\neffort to expose the University's<br />\nprofitable investments in South<br />\nAfrica is equally irrelevant to<br />\nWile's sterile conception of this<br />\nnoble goal of promoting human<br />\nwelfare.<br />\nBeyond his objection to the<br />\nChaplain raising such \"irrelevant\"<br />\nand \"political\" issues, Wile<br />\ncondemns the manner in which<br />\nthese issues are presented. Wile's<br />\ndescription of the Chaplains<br />\nOffice \"brazenly proselytizng\"'<br />\nlarge numbers of Hopkins<br />\nstudents through messianic rallies<br />\nwhich prevent them from<br />\nevaluating the reasons behind the<br />\narguments presented, is ludicrous<br />\nand almost comic. In fact, Dr.<br />\nWickwire is often a lonely voice<br />\non campus striving to remind us<br />\nof the tragic conditions which<br />\nconfront so much of humanity.<br />\nPopular acceptance has never<br />\nbeen a precondition for Dr.<br />\nWickwire, or his staff, as they<br />\nhave tried to carry out this much<br />\nneeded function. For instance,<br />\nDr. Wickwire spoke out against<br />\nour nation's responsiblitiy for the<br />\ncarnage in Southeast Asia, long<br />\nbefore the war was generally<br />\nperceived as wrong. Whether one<br />\npersonally agrees with Dr.<br />\nWickwire is not at issue. What is<br />\nimportant however, is that these<br />\nproblems are brought to our<br />\nattention. For how can we<br />\npossibley strive to \"promote the<br />\ngood of our fellow man\" if we<br />\nrefuse to ask the central<br />\nquestions of the human<br />\ncondition simply because moral<br />\nchoices are too \"gooey\" and<br />\noften painful. How much simpler<br />\nto sit \"passively\" while being<br />\n\"exposed\" to the \"carefully<br /><br />\ncoordinated\" presentations of<br />\nthe University's Office of Public<br />\nRelations. In the past the<br />\nAdministration has demonstrated<br />\nsuch moral foresight and has so<br />\nbrilliantly promoted the \"good<br />\nname\" of our university by such<br />\n\"apolitical\" acts as granting an<br />\nhonorary humanities degree to<br />\nthe daughter of the progressive<br />\nShah of Iran. One shudders at<br />\nWile's Orwellian vision of a<br />\nuniversity where all the<br />\n\"difficult\" moral questions are<br />\npresented in a \"carefully<br />\ncoordinated\" fashion by Garland<br />\nHall.<br />\nIn addition to Mr. Wile's<br />\ndubious assumptions, his case<br />\nrests on a collection of<br />\nmisrepresented facts which bring<br />\nhis intellectual integrity seriously<br />\ninto question. For instance Mr.<br />\nWile charges that \"Many groups<br />\n(he is only able to name two,<br />\nCCAPL and the New Political<br />\nCaucus) whose meetings are<br />\nco-sponsored by the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice are apparently composed<br />\nlargely of outsiders,...\" While we<br />\nare not familiar with the<br />\nmembership roll of the CCAPL<br /><br />\nwe can report that there is not<br />\none member of the<br />\nNew Political Caucus (NPC)<br />\nwho is not directly connected<br />\nwith this university. Wile also<br />\nreports that the recent apartheid<br />\nforum, co-sponsored by the<br />\nChaplain's Office and the NPC<br />\n\"... showed films produced by<br />\norganizations of questionable<br />\nobjectivity.\" Of the two films<br />\nMr. Wile is speaking about, the<br />\nfirst, \"Last Grave at Dimbaza\"<br />\nwas largely financed by a number<br />\nof American denominations, at<br />\nthe national level, and is most<br /><br />\nCont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nDavid And Goliath letters to the editor<br />\nSo far this year, the Hopkins' football team has failed to<br />\nattract much notice.

Glenn Beall: Is He Statehouse Material?<br />\nBY ROBERT R. RIGGS AND MARK J. SHUSTED<br />\nJ. Glenn Beall served one term<br />\nas a Republican United States<br />\nSenator from Maryland between<br />\n1971 and 1977. Prior to that, he<br />\nwas Minority Leader in the State<br />\nHouse of Delegates from 1963 to<br />\n1968, and a US. Representative<br />\nfrom 1969 until 1971.<br />\nNews-Letter: What are the main<br />\nissues in this campaign?<br />\nJ. Glenn Beall: Well, I think the<br />\nmain issues in this campaign are<br />\ntaxes, the crime issue; economic<br />\ndevelopment is a very topical<br />\nissue in Maryland because we've<br />\nhad. a net loss of 41,000<br />\nmanufacturing jobs in this state<br />\nin the years 1971 to 1975.<br />\nI think the management of the<br />\ngovernment is a principal issue.<br />\nWho can best provide the<br />\naggressive, firm leadership that is<br />\nnecessary to apply some fiscal<br />\ndiscipline and at hte same time<br />\nmove this state ahead with spirit<br />\nand vitality, because we're a state<br />\nthat's rich in human and natural<br />\nresources and I think we're going<br />\nto have to have someone who is<br />\ngoing to convince the people that<br />\nthey have a lot to be proud of<br />\nabout being Marylanders and<br />\ntherefore earn the respect of the<br />\npeople of this state in their<br />\ngovernment by having the spirit<br />\nand vitality that is necessary to<br />\nconvince them that they are<br />\ngetting their dollar's worth out of<br />\nthe government for the dollar<br />\nthey pay in taxes.<br /><br />\nthreat--and I think we should<br />\nrespond to it even though<br />\nMaryland can't have Proposition<br />\n13 because of the nature of our<br />\nConstitution--then we have to<br />\nlimit the amount of revenues<br />\navailable to government. We have<br />\nto make sure that the money that<br />\nis being spent by government is<br />\nspent in a way so that the public<br />\nis convinced that the services of<br />\ngovernment are being delivered in<br />\nan effective, efficient and<br />\neconomical way.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel corruption<br />\nremains a primary issue for<br />\nMaryland politics?<br />\nBeall: According to the polls, it is<br />\nnot. But on the other hand, I<br />\nthink the public wants to respect<br />\nthose people who are in<br />\ngovernment and therefore I think<br />\nthat the people who would lead<br />\nthe government should have to<br />\nconduct the government in an<br />\nopen fashion and I think the best<br />\nway to convince the public that<br />\nwhat's being done is being done<br />\nfor their own good is to make<br />\nsure the government process is<br />\nopen and I think one of the<br />\nproblems we've had in this state<br />\nresults from the fact that the<br />\nlines have been too tightly drawn<br />\naround the statehouse in.<br />\nAnnapolis. There hasn't been<br />\nenough outreach to get people<br />\nfrom outside the political sphere<br />\ninvolved in the governmental<br />\nprocess.<br /><br />\nCandidate Beall in a rare garrulous moment.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of<br />\nProposition 13 in California and<br />\ntile so-called tax revolt?<br />\nBeall: Well, I think that<br />\nProposition 13 is indicative ofi<br />\nthe problem we have. Proposition<br />\n13, I contend, is an indication on<br />\nthe part of the public not that<br />\nthey are anxious to quit paying<br />\ntaxes but that they are concerned<br />\nthat they aren't getting their<br />\ndollar's worth of value out of the<br />\ndollar they pay in taxes. They<br />\nthink their money is being<br />\nwasted, and that services are<br />\nbeing duplicated. Therefore, if<br />\nwe're going to respond to this<br /><br />\nI believe you have to open up.<br />\nI believe in sunshine laws. I've<br />\nalways been an advocate at the<br />\nfederal level of sunshine laws and<br />\nI think that to the extent'<br />\npossible decisions ought to be<br />\nmade in public. In that way you<br />\ndon't pose the threat of<br />\ncorruption. Obviously, you have<br />\nto be ever-watchful of people in<br />\ngovernment to make sure they're<br />\nconducting themselves in a<br />\nthoroughly honest way.<br />\nN-L: What policy do you favor<br />\non state aid to higher education,<br />\nincluding specifically scholarship<br />\nprograms such as the SSIG?<br /><br />\nBeall: Well, I think the one fault<br />\nI find in Maryland's scholarship<br />\nprogram is that we still have a<br />\ncertain number of political<br />\nscholarships in the state. I think<br />\nas soon as we can if it's<br />\npolitically possible we ought to<br />\ndo away with the so-called<br />\nSenatorial scholarships. I think<br />\nscholarships ought to be awarded<br />\non the basis of need and merit,<br />\nand not on the basis of personal<br />\nfriendship. I think that's the way<br />\nour scholarship program ought to<br />\nbe designed.<br />\nAs far as overall aid to higher<br />\neducation is concerned, I think<br />\nthe state has to be alert to the<br />\nnecessity of making sure that<br />\ncollege is always an attainable<br />\ngoal for those people who want<br />\nto take advantage of an<br />\neducational opportunity<br />\nregardless of their income or<br />\nsocial status. I think therefore<br />\nyou should have loan programs<br />\nand scholarship programs readily<br />\navailable for those people who<br />\nneed them.<br />\nN-L: What do you think of the<br />\nconditions and prospects of the<br />\nRepublican party nationwide?<br />\nHas it recovered from Watergate?<br />\nBeall: The condition hasn't been<br />\ntoo good; the prospects are<br />\nb etter. The condition is<br />\nimproving. I know Senator<br />\nBrock very well, who is chairman<br />\nof the Republican National<br />\nCommittee. As a matter of fact, I<br />\ntalked to him the day before<br />\nyesterday. He and I served in the<br />\nUnited States Senate together.<br />\nHe has an appreciation of what<br />\nwe call nuts and bolts activities.<br />\nThis means you have to go out in<br />\nthe grass roots and organize<br />\npeople where they live and get<br />\nthem interested in the<br />\ngovernmental process and<br />\npolitical process. The<br />\nRepublicans have not reached<br />\nout enough into the community.<br />\nI think the Republicans have had<br />\ngood programs but they haven't<br />\nconvinced the people of the<br />\ncountry that these were the<br />\nprograms that were for their<br />\ngood. I think you will find now<br />\nthat Democrats are coming<br />\naround and embracing<br />\nRepublican programs.<br />\nThe mood of economy and<br />\nefficiency of government is<br />\nsomething the Republicans have<br />\nbeen talking about for a large<br />\nnumber of years. When I was in<br />\nWashington I used to constantly<br />\nargue with Senator Mondale who<br />\nsat across the table from me on<br />\nthe Budget Committee about<br />\nhow we ought to spend the<br />\npublic's money. I was the guy<br />\nwho was on what I considered to<br />\nbe the efficient, effective<br />\ngovernment side and he was of<br />\nthe philosophy that you solved<br />\nall of the peoples' problems by<br />\nthrowing more money at them.<br />\nBut now these guys are reversing<br />\ntheir field. The public's caught<br />\nup with this philosophy and<br />\ndoesn't like it any more and<br />\nthey're coming around and<br />\nsaying,\"Oh, we have to do things<br />\ndifferent ways.\" This is what<br />\nRepublicans have been saying.<br />\nTherefore I think it's incumbent<br />\nupon Republicans to convince<br />\nthe public that this is indeed the<br />\ncase.<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nC.hgca 19<br />\n0<br /><br />\n0<br />\nco<br /><br />\n5<br />\nN-L: Do you see Richard Nixon<br />\nassuming the role of elder<br />\nstatesman in the Republican<br />\nparty?<br />\nBeall: No.<br />\nN-L: What measures should be<br />\ntaken to relieve prison<br />\novercrowding?<br />\nBeall: Obviously, the immediate<br />\nmeasure that should be taken is<br />\nproviding more prison beds.<br />\nThat's a very simplistic answer;<br />\nunfortunately, the building of a<br />\nprison in Maryland has become a<br />\npolitical football and decisions<br />\nthat should have been made a<br />\n'couple of years ago and a prison<br />\nthat should have been built by<br />\nnow remains to be built. The<br />\ndecision still hasn't finally been<br />\nmade. I believe it's very<br />\nregrettable. It has certainly been<br />\na black eye on the part of those<br />\npeople who have been in charge<br />\nof the government that this has<br />\nbeen allowed to happen.<br />\nI think that the prison ought<br />\nto be built downtown in<br />\nBaltimore next to the existing<br />\npenitentiary and I think it's the<br />\nresponsibility of the Governor to<br />\nget together with the corrections<br />\nofficials, planners, engineers, and<br />\nothers and suggest to them that<br />\n\"this is where we're going to<br />\nbuild the prison, now come up<br />\nwith a viable plan that's going to<br />\nserve the purposes for which it is<br />\nbeing built in an effective way.\"<br /><br />\nN-L: Did the Sunpapers make<br />\nHarry Hughes?<br />\nBeall: Yes. I don't think he<br /><br />\nwould have won the primary had<br />\nit not been for that endorsement.<br />\nN-L: What effect will media<br />\nendorsements have on the<br />\ncampaign in the general election?<br />\nBeall: It remains to be seen. I<br />\ndon't know. Actually, if you are<br />\nendorsed by the media you make<br />\nall of it that you can. If you<br />\naren't, you downplay it as much<br />\nas possible. So it depends on<br />\nwhen and how strongly the<br />\nendorsements come. Obviously in<br />\nthe primary it was a major factor<br />\nbecause the endorsement came so<br />\nearly and gave credibility to a<br />\ncandidate who wasn't being<br />\nconsidered seriously up to that<br />\ntime. The endorsement came<br />\nfour weeks in advance of the<br />\nelection. Obviously there was<br />\nplenty of time for people to react<br />\nto that endorsement. If the<br />\nendorsement had come the<br />\nnormal one week before the<br />\nelection it probably wouldn't<br />\nhave had that kind of impact.<br />\nN-L: Most media attention was<br />\nfocused on the Democratic<br />\nchallengers prior to the primary<br />\nelection. Will the late primary<br />\nhurt your chances?<br />\nBeall: I think it helps our<br />\nchances. I've always been in favor<br />\nof a late primary. It does a<br />\ncouple of things. First of all it<br />\nmakes the elections cheaper. You<br />\nknow one of the problems you<br />\nhave in running for office these<br />\ndays is raising sufficient funds.<br />\nI've always been in favor of<br />\nshortening these elections in our<br />\nCont. on p. 7<br /><br />\nJ. Glenn Beall and Harry Hughes in recent forum<br /><br />\n\"It<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER 1 PAGE 7<br /><br />\nCouncil Candidate Disqualified<br />\nCont. from p. 1<br />\nPansini admits that he lied, but<br />\nsays the lie \"was not grounds<br />\nenough to throw me off the<br />\nballot...I made up a false excuse,<br />\nbut it was just supposed to be<br />\nbetween me and Monroe.I didn't<br />\nsay, Monroe, read this to the<br />\nforum.'... I thought that he<br />\nwould have thrown me off<br />\nanyway (if Pansini told the<br />\ntruth). I didn't want him to think<br />\nthat I would not show up for<br />\nmeetings.

I read in the paper<br />\ntoday of the tremendous cost of<br />\nthe Democratic primary. I think<br />\nif there is a short space of time in<br />\nwhich we have the campaigns it<br />\ndoes reduce the cost.<br />\nI think you're better able to<br />\nkeep the public's attention.<br />\nthink this primary has been going<br />\non for the last year; the public<br />\nreally didn't get into it until<br />\nabout the last two weeks. In a<br />\ngeneral election campaign,<br />\nhowever, when you have two<br />\npeople running, one against the<br />\nother, and presumably you have<br />\nsome opposing philosophies and<br />\nideologies, then I think you can<br />\nreally attract the public's<br />\nattention. I think we have an<br />\neight-week period this year<br />\nbetween the primary and the<br />\ngeneral election. I think that's<br />\nfine. I think that helps me rather<br />\nthan hurts me because so far I've<br />\nbeen the one who's talking about<br />\nthe issues and I'm waiting for my<br />\nopponent to suggest what he's<br />\ngoing to do if he's elected<br />\nGovernor of Maryland and even<br />\nthough he's had a year to talk<br />\nabout all of this he hasn't talked<br />\nabout it yet. Because we're<br />\nspeaking specifically and he's<br />\nspeaking generally I think it's<br />\ncoming to my benefit.<br />\nN-L: Can you relate to Baltimore<br />\nCity and its problems sufficiently<br />\nto attract its voters?<br />\nBeall: I'm from Western<br />\nMaryland, out in Allegheny<br />\ncounty. Although I've lived in<br />\nthe Washington area in recent<br />\nyears because I was in the federal<br />\ngovernment, I certainly think I<br />\ncan relate to Baltimore city and<br />\nits problems because sometimes<br />\nyou're better off looking at<br />\nproblems from outside than<br />\ninside. You will note that the<br />\nBaltimore Sun the day before<br />\nyesterday had an editorial that<br />\ncommented on the good things<br />\nhad been involved in for<br />\nBaltimore City when I was<br />\nUnited States Senator. These<br />\nincluded some area<br />\nredevelopment downtown; it<br />\nincluded the preservation of the<br />\nPublic Health Service Hospital<br />\nover here just off the campus. I<br />\nwas instrumental in having the<br />\nSocial Security Building built<br />\ndowntown, and I am also very<br />\nconcerned about the<br />\ndevelopment of the port in doing<br />\nthose things that are necessary to<br />\nmaintain this port in a<br />\ncompetitive position in<br />\ncomparison to ports up and<br />\ndown the Eastern seaboard. I<br />\nthink I have a very good<br /><br />\nperception of Baltimore's<br />\nproblems as a result of my<br />\nprevious service and even though<br />\nI don't live here, and because I<br />\ndon't live here, I'm in a better<br />\nposition to evaluate the<br />\nproblems, put a priority on them,<br />\nand do something about them.<br />\nOne of the problems we've had<br />\nin this state results from the fact<br />\nthat people in government in the<br />\npast have tended to pit Baltimore<br />\nagainst the state, and vice versa. I<br />\nthink, as I said earlier, that we're<br />\na state that is rich in human and<br />\nmaterial resources and we ought<br />\nto build on each other's<br />\nstrengths rather than emphasize<br />\neach other's weaknesses. I think<br />\nit's the job of a governor to build<br />\na bridge between the various<br />\nregions of this state and I think<br />\nbecause I don't come from<br />\nBaltimore I can convince people<br />\noutside of Baltimore that<br />\nBaltimore is indeed the single<br />\nmost important economic factor<br />\nin our state. Baltimore is the<br />\neconomic hub of our state and<br />\ntherefore people who don't live<br />\nin our state will have to be<br />\nconcerned about the economic<br />\nand social viability of this city.<br />\nN-L: Later this year, the Colts<br />\nplay the Redskins. Who will you<br />\nrootfor?<br />\nBeall: Well, I think I would wish<br />\n.both of them success.<br />\nN-L: And if the score should be<br />\ntied after four quarters with<br />\novertime resulting?<br />\nBeall: I have fondness for each of<br />\nthese teams. At.one time I held<br />\nseason tickets to both teams but<br />\nI had to give that up because I<br />\ncouldn't afford that. So I gave<br />\nthem both up, as a matter of<br /><br />\nfact. Then when I went to<br />\nWashington I got season tickets<br />\nfor the Redskins' games because I.<br />\nhappen to be closer, but more<br />\nrecently I've been going to some<br />\nCults' games. I don't think it's<br />\nnecessary to take Sides even<br />\nthough I must admit I have a<br />\nlittle bit of partiality for the<br />\nColts.<br />\nN-L: Final question. The<br />\noverwhelming mnjority of voters<br />\nin Maryland are registered<br />\nDemocrats. Who is going to vote<br />\nfor you?<br />\nBeall: A lot of those<br />\nDemocrats , and let me answer<br />\nthat question quite seriously.<br />\nLook at the Democratic primary.<br />\nAlthough the Republicans only<br />\nhave 20% of the registered voters,<br />\nin the Democratic primary, only<br />\n40% of those people registered as<br />\nDemocrats took the trouble to<br />\nvote, and of those who voted<br />\nonly 37% voted for the winner. A<br />\nlittle quick math therefore shows<br />\nyou that over 80% of the voters<br />\nregistered as Democrats either<br />\ndidn't vote in the primary or<br />\ndidn't vote for the winner. I<br />\nconsider that a great pool of<br />\nvoters that I can look to to get<br />\nsome support, and so they are<br />\nthe kind of people that I expect<br />\nto vote for me. I think on the<br />\nbasis of the programs that I<br />\npresent in the campaign in view<br />\nof the fact that they have<br />\nhistorically voted independently<br />\nof their party, and on the basis of<br />\nthe fact that people in Maryland<br />\nbasically want a change in<br />\nadministrations, that we're going<br />\nto get a lot of support from that<br />\n80% and I think that's where I'm<br />\ngoing to win the election.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nOffice of Special Events presents<br /><br />\n\"FROM STRESS TO<br />\nHIGH-LEVEL WELLNESS\"<br />\nA multi-media presentation with emphasis on skills for taking full<br />\nresponsibility for one's health, including nutrition, physical!<br />\nawareness and stress control.<br /><br />\nby John W.Travis,M.D.,M.P.H.<br />\nDirector,W ellness Resource Center,<br />\nMill Valley,California<br /><br />\nTHURSDAY,OCTOBER 26<br />\n7:30 P.M.<br />\nGarrett Room, M.S.E.

This man told Luce<br />\nthat the only men in the factories<br />\nare police and managers.<br />\nAccording to this individual,<br />\nfactories exclusively employ<br />\nyoung girls because \"they are<br />\nmore docile and obedient than<br /><br />\nboys, and they work cheaper.\"<br />\nLuce estimates the average salary<br />\nof a Taiwanese factory worker is<br />\n$50 a month, as compared with<br />\n$900 per month for similar work<br />\nin the United States.

Marshall), the head of the family, is the<br />\nonly character who is not driven by an artist's<br />\ninner-vision. Eve (Geraldine Page), the mother of this<br />\ntalented brood, is an interior designer. Of her three<br />\ndaughters, Renata (Diane Keaton), the oldest, is a poet<br />\nwho has married a novelist incapable of accepting or<br />\ncompeting with his wife's success; Flyn (Kristin Griffith),<br />\nan aspiring actress who has come to an impasse in her<br />\ncareer; and the youngest daughter, Joey (Marybeth Hurt)<br />\nhas the spirit of an artist but is lacking an outlet for her<br />\ncreativity. (This is eventually resolved because Interiors is<br />\nher creation, a product of her own unique vision).<br />\nCont. on p.15<br /><br />\nWoody Allen's first attempt at a serious movie,<br />\nInteriors, is clumsy, mawkish, cliche-ridden and, above all,<br />\nstagnant. Hopelessly melodramatic, the film is a parody of<br />\nitself.<br />\nThe plot is simple: three sisters, all living away from<br />\nhome, react strongly to the news of their parents.<br />\nseparation and subsequent divorce. When the father<br />\ndecides to remarry, mama disintegrates. And during the<br />\nhoneymoon at the family beach house, (with all three<br />\nsisters in attendance), tht Rejected Wife arrives<br />\nunexpectedly, stands motionless in the doorway for five<br />\nminutes listening to her favorite daughter castigate her for<br />\nher sins, then walks slowly and solemnly into the ocean,<br />\ndrowning without a word.'<br />\nOf course, the sisters (Diane Keaton, Kristin<br />\nGriffith and Marybeth Hurt) each have problems of their<br /><br />\nIptertaimpept<br /><br />\nOlufunmilayo<br />\nrhe Muffins<br /><br />\nown. The eldest (Keaton) leads a particularly tortuous<br />\nexistence: successful as a writer herself, she must<br />\nconstantly reassure her alcoholic novelist husband<br />\n(Richard Jordan) that she does not consider him a failure.<br />\nHe refuses to accept her encouragement and,<br />\noverwhelmed by his creative agony, tries unsuccessfully to<br />\nseduce the younger sister (Griffith), saying, \"I haven't<br />\nmade love to a woman I didn't feel inferior to for six<br />\nyears.\"<br />\nSo much for the action. What's wrong with this film?<br />\nSimply put, Interiors is nothing but a large, abortive<br />\ncliche. The trauma of separation, the fragility of family<br />\nties, the destructive competitiveness of spouses working in<br />\nthe same field--these are all familiar, overworked themes.<br />\nThat doesn't mean they shouldn't be explored--but Allen<br />\ntreats his subject matter with all the subtlety of King<br />\nKong.<br />\nCryptic statements. Cutting replies. Pregnant pauses.<br />\nEmotional tirades. All mixed together,against a<br />\nbackground of bare scenery, innumerable close-ups and<br />\nabrupt scene changes.<br />\nAt one point, the camera focuses on Keaton's hand,<br />\npen to paper. The hand crosses out one word, substitutes<br />\nanother, crosses that one out, substitutes another, then<br />\nsuddenly crumples up the paper and flings it aside.<br />\nWriting is torture. Only I saw exactly the same scene in<br />\nJulia last summer, and it didn't work then, either.<br />\nAnother example of Allen's clumsiness is illustrated by<br />\nthe photo which appears on this page. Here in the<br />\nNews-Letter it doesn't seem so bad; but imagine seeing it<br />\n(and another, similar wedding shot) prolonged for 20<br />\nseconds on the screen while all three actresses strain to<br />\navoid batting an eyelash. It's nauseatingly trite.<br />\nPerhaps Allen's problem is that he is reacting too<br />\nstrongly against his own comic heritage.

Buckley, Jr. adds distinction<br />\nand delightful irony. According to Buckley, \"Those in<br />\nsearch of the meaning of humane letters need go no<br />\nfurther than to Doonesbury.\" The era of the socially<br />\nconscious comic strip has arrived.<br />\n\"Doonesbury\" began in the early seventies as an<br />\nextension of Trudeau's campus comic strip for the Yale<br />\nnewspaper. The gags centered around a few students at a<br />\nNew England university. Typical humor was Mike ineptly<br />\ntrying to make it with a dumb blonde. With Watergate,<br />\n\"Doonesbury\" found itself at the right place at the right<br />\ntime - and exploited the opportunity. Many Americans<br />\nstopped reading the double-talk on the front pages and<br />\nturned inward to the tongue-in-cheek honesty of this<br />\ncomic strip. Trudeau made the cover of Time and won a<br />\nPulitzer prize.<br />\nSince that time \"Doonesbury's\" cast of characters has<br />\nexpanded and shifted emphasis, but the old crew still<br />\nremains.

This made me anticipate a<br />\nsurrealistic experience; I expected musical conventions<br />\nwould be exploded. But while the explosion of The<br />\nMuffins was loud, it was not always on target. Still,<br />\nalthough The Muffins will probably never catch on<br />\ncommercially, theirs is an art form that should be listened<br />\nto and reckoned with.<br />\nThat is exactly what Monday night's audience in the<br />\nL-V room did. In sharp contrast to Dada audiences in the<br />\nearly part of this century who were prone to riotous<br />\ndisturbances, the Muffins' crowd of 70 people was very<br />\nreceptive.<br />\nThe make-up of the band is similar to that of a<br />\ntraditional jazz quartet. Tom Scott (not of the L.A.<br />\nExpress) plays many varied wind instruments, including<br />\nclarinets, saxophones and flutes. Dave Newhouse plays<br />\nelectric piano and synthesizer, and doubles on some wind<br />\ninstruments. These two musicians are supported by Billy<br />\nSwann on bass and Paul Sears on percussion. The band<br />\noriginated four years ago, and are based in Rockville,<br />\nMaryland. They have released four albums, and have more<br />\non the way. These albums have a very strong international<br />\nreputation, especially in England, but their following in<br />\nAmerica is not as large. Last Sunday, though, at the Zoo<br />\nFestival for International New Music in New York, The<br />\nMuffins received the greatest response from a crowd that<br />\nincluded 'everyone' in progressive music.<br />\nTheir concert Monday night also was worthy of<br />\nattention. The Muffins were best when their music was<br />\n'traditional', when it had a beat. (A supporter of<br />\nprogressive music would claim that this is the<br />\nnarrow-minded opinion of one who cannot accept music<br /><br />\nAi TIN<br /><br />\nthat is devoid of conventional forms.) The music was<br />\nmost pleasing when the bass, drums and keyboards<br />\ncreated a strong underlying structure onto which the<br />\nmelodies of the wind instruments were layered, resulting<br />\nin an expansive textural complexity. The melodies were<br />\nmost effective when they were either lyrical, or repeated<br />\nrunning scales or arpeggios. When there was a method or<br />\npattern to their explosions, The Muffins were able to<br />\nbreak down the traditional forms of music and make their<br /><br />\nown musical statements that were both communicative<br />\nand surreal.<br />\nThe Muffins were at their worst when they seemed to<br />\nfire at will. These moments consisted of attacks on<br />\nstrange instruments and percussives, resulting in 'noise'<br />\nthat was totally absent of pattern . All their music is<br />\ncompletely scored, and it was obvious they were not<br />\nimprovising, but the effect on the listener was one of<br />\ncomplete disorientation with the music.<br />\nThe most commercially successful band The Muffins<br />\ncould be compared to is Return To Forever. This is<br />\ncertainly an insult to The Muffins, though, because<br />\nalthough they may not be as polished or professional,<br />\ntheir music is much more interesting. The band could also<br />\nbe compared with Robert Fripp and Brian Eno. They are<br />\nnot necessarily working in jazz, but they are trying to<br />\nreconsider and to expand the limits of popular music. The<br />\nmusician probably most closely related to The Muffins is<br />\nPhilip Glass. His music has much stronger classical ties,<br />\nbut it contains a similar jazz feel, and also e mploys<br />\nelectronic keyboards and wind instruments. The music of<br />\nPhilip Glass is minimalism in its highest form. He strips all<br />\nthe elements of music bare, layering these simple<br />\nstructures on top of each other for a complex, yet<br />\nhypnotic sound. The Muffins never seem to produce the<br />\nsame trance-like quality, but in many ways they are<br />\nstriving for the same musical goals as Philip Glass.<br />\nThe Muffins' approach to traditional music is not<br />\nnihilistic; they are not trying to destroy all institutions of<br />\nmusical form. Their music is surreal in the sense that they<br />\nare trying to explode musical conventions. But in the end,<br />\ntheir music is simply progressive; they are trying to<br />\nexpand the possibilities of popular music and jazz.<br />\nOccasionally the music misfires, but The Muffins deserve<br />\nattention and an important position on the American<br />\nmusic scene.<br /><br />\n's<br />\nIs<br />\nAllen<br />\niors<br />\nInter<br />\nBijou) Introspective Gem<br /><br />\nA Generation-- This is the first film in Andrzej<br />\nWadja's informal trilogy dealing with the World War II<br />\n,<br />\nresistance movement.

This interior<br />\nbecomes the film's central metaphor for the inner<br />\nemptiness experienced by the people who inhabit this<br />\nalien landscape. The sterility of bare floors, and white<br />\nhospital rooms flooded by harsh sunlight represents the<br />\ncharacters' inability to express emotions in a practical<br />\nmanner, outside of any artistic craft. Each character<br />\nresists the type of articulate expression of abstract<br />\nemotions which comes so easily when removed and seen<br />\nas art. In this interior, emotions are disciplined by a<br />\npervading atmosphere of rationalism.<br />\nArthur, who is not affected by such inabilities, provides<br />\nthe spark which presents a family conflict. Unable to deal<br />\nwith the frenzy of emotion that Eve has subdued at the<br />\ncost of the rest of the family, he asks for a divorce. From<br />\nthis point on, Eve exists at the apex of a rage which<br />\nremains hidden and controlled. Arthur is eventually<br />\nmarried to Pearl (Maureen Stapleton), a boisterous and<br />\nsensible multi-widowed woman who hasn't the least<br />\ndifficulty with self-expression.<br />\nSimilarly, the sterility of the settings used in each<br />\nscene, and the characters' bland dialogue also create There<br />\nare numerous shots from behind glass windows and at<br />\ntimes the camera pans an empty beach front from behind<br />\nstorm fences. This motif is often used to represent a<br />\nbarrier which can distort perception or simply separate<br />\nthe characters from the rest of the world.<br />\nInteriors is steeped in Bergmanesque traditions and<br />\nlogic. The subject of people who are destroyed by the<br />\nextreme control they exert upon their emotions and their<br />\ninability to project those emotions is a recurring theme in<br />\nBergman's films. Most reminiscent of this difficulty is<br />\nPersona . In this film strict control is used to conceal \"the<br />\nabyss between what we are for others and what we are for<br />\nourselves.\"<br />\nAs in Play it Again, Sam, Woody Allen repeatedly relies<br />\nupon our ability to respond to film cliches and references<br />\nwithout much effort. Consequently, Interiors can appear<br />\nto be a trite, cliche-ridden, runaway metaphor. As with<br />\nBergman's Persona, however, Interiors does not aim to be<br />\nentertaining, but introspective.<br />\nthanthe Sun.<br />\nBut throughout the poingnant social commentary,<br />\n\"Doonesbury\" remains true to the one essential tenet of<br />\ncartooning: entertainment.

The credentials<br />\nare almost as impressive as the<br />\nman himself.<br />\nPat Lohrey reflects a<br />\nbackground steeped in the<br />\ntradition of Baltimore wrestling.<br />\nPat's father, Phil Lohrey,<br />\ncoached a number of superior<br />\nwrestling teams at the University<br />\nof Baltimore in the '50's and<br />\nundoubtedly had \u2022a huge<br />\ninfluence on his son's interest in<br />\nthe sport.

In coordination with<br />\nMorgan State's wrestling coach<br /><br />\nJim Phillips, Pat will give those<br />\nwho cannot practice at the<br />\nregular time a chance to work<br />\nout with MSU wrestlers in the<br />\nevening.
