Since the bill will undoubtedly be notable more for what it<br />\ndoes not contain than for what it<br />\ndoes, it is perhaps a bit early to<br />\ncriticize it. However, even .in the<br />\nexcerpt that appearedin the NewsLetter there are tiems that are not<br />\nonly useless but positively harmful.<br />\nConsider, for example, Point<br />\nFour, which concerns the NewsLetter directly: \"No student publication shall be subjected to any<br />\nform of censorship so long as it<br />\n<br />\nremains within the limits of acceptable community standards\"? Would thi!<br />\nmean a ban on four-letter words?<br />\nMost members of the university<br />\ncommunity use four-letter words<br />\nin their speech. Would an article<br />\nby a member of the NLFSV bc<br />\npermitted to appear? Many Hopkins students support a policy<br />\nthat says that members of the<br />\nNLFSV should be killed. The<br />\npeople who are to define \"acceptable community standards\"<br />\nare faced with a difficult task<br />\nindeed.<br />\nBut more important than the<br />\ndifficulty of defining these standards are the insidious implications of even trying. The editors<br />\nof the News-Letter are entrusted<br />\nwith an important job.

Franke<br />\n<br />\nThe Yearning Years<br />\nIn retrospect, a college \"education\" must seem a cruel paradox. If<br />\nwe have learned anything from four years of lectures, seminars,<br />\nexams and papers it is the harsh realization of how much remains<br />\nunlearned. A semester of Dante teaches us how inadequate one semester can be. We learn enough to become curious, enough to become<br />\ninterested, but in the last analysis, not nearly enough. College teases<br />\nus but we can't get no satisfaction. It takes us half way there, if that<br />\nfar.<br />\nThe pressure to specialize pours salt on the wound. It is as strong<br />\nat Hopkins as anywhere, perhaps stronger. The pre-med, with Mitochondria and adenosine triphosphate burdening his mind, has only<br />\nvague recollections of Homer and Hegel.The history major associates<br />\nchemistry with lysergic acid and spends his waking hours absorbed in<br />\nthe revisionist theories of the revisionist, who revised the revisionist<br />\ninterpretation of the origins of the Civil War. The Hopkins student<br />\nmay gain some expertise in a narrow field of study while in other<br />\ndisciplines he remains functionally illiterate.<br />\nIn this sense, the University may be at fault. We are always told<br />\nabout the virtues of our liberal academic philosophy, struck from<br />\nthe mold of German universities. Hopkins is, in fact, a ;staunch defender of academic freedom and it is indeed a more desirable educational philosophy than that practiced by a Princeton or Chicago<br />\nwhere rigidity is the by-word. The freedom to structure one's education almost free of insipid requirements should not be taken lightly.<br />\nThe reality of this liberal philosophy, however, has not created the<br />\n\"Renaissance man\" at Hopkins nor has it created anything more<br />\nthan an incipient specialist.<br />\nThe fault does not, however,lie with Lincoln Gordon,or his nine<br />\npredecessors,or the faculty,or the student. The roots of the problem<br />\nmust be traced back to the day one enters public school for the first<br />\ntime. The tragedy of the Hopkins student is that the liberal, progressive philosophy of his college does not jive with the rigid conservatism that governs the first twelve years of his education. In essence,<br />\na liberal philosophy of higher education assumes that the individual<br />\npossesses a high degree of technical knowledge and that a college<br />\nshould stress development of the analytical powers of reasoning. This<br />\nis a false assumption since the products of the public school system<br />\nare ill-prepared to cope with anything more provocative than Introductory Chemistry or History.<br />\nConsequently, Hopkins and other surveyors of academic freedom<br />\nmust keep a stiff upper lip and give their entering students cram<br />\ncourses in the fundamentals of Biology and Sociology. It is not until the third or fourth year that the student is asked to use his mind<br />\nand manipulate ideas, but by that time his intellectual curiosity is<br />\nworn thin by chemical formulas and historical dates.<br />\nThe blame, as we said, lies squarely with the American system of<br />\npublic education. Numerous attempts have been made to reform<br />\n\"the system\" but bureaucratization has rendered them futile. Recently, a committee chaired by McGeorge Bundy of the Ford<br />\nThundation suggested to Mayor Lindsay of New York a sweeping<br />\ndecentralization of that city's school system. The committee's report<br />\nproposed the creation of 30 to 60 largely autonomous school districts with each district run by a local school board. These local<br />\nschool boards would have the power to hire and fire superintendants<br />\nand teachers,determine curricula and make decisions on tenure. As a<br />\na result, the Board of Education would be restricted to the role of an<br />\noverseer. But the Bundy Report and any other plan for school decentralization is destined to fail unless basic changes are made in the<br />\nclassroom.<br />\nPsychologists have been saying for years that the youngster is<br />\ncapable of a much higher level of reasoning and understanding than<br />\nboth his teachers and parents give him credit. The absudity of a college student clutching a Spanish elements book is a severe indictment of his elementary school years. While he was playing with<br />\nblocks and coloring pretty pictures, his mind was capable of a greater challenge-only the challenge never came.<br />\nThis process of intellectual retardation leads to the great myths<br />\nthat students acquire in high school. The industrial revolution is<br />\nglorified while some of its more iunfortunate creations are totally<br />\nignored. Wars are exciting and colorful, not brutal and unbearable.<br />\nThere have been some energetic people who tried to fight the<br />\nsystem, but they,like all the utopians before them, suffered ignominious defeat. Jonathan Kozol was kicked out of a Boston school<br />\nfor reading a Langston Hughes poem to his class and Herbert Kohl's<br />\nsixth grade class in Harlem was forced to publish secretly a newspaper which expressed the fears and horrors of the ghetto. The system<br />\nhad driven them underground.<br />\nThe system is bureaucratic, insensitive,rigid and worst of all - the<br />\ndestroyer of people's minds. It is, therefore, the unwanted duty of<br />\ninstitutions like Hopkins to reclaim, and regenerate the once promising intellects of its students. In this process, the tenets of academic freedom are necessarily neglected. This is indeed tragic but<br />\nHopkins will be forced to turn out unsatisfactory products as long<br />\nas she is faced with the task of revitalizing the minds of her students.<br />\nThe cruel paradox of college education will persist until the public<br />\nschool system with the help of progressive universities turns'inward<br />\nand destroys those structures that contribute so heavily to the intellectual retardation of the student.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE,JANUARY 19, 1968<br />\n<br />\nLester: Gut Coarse<br />\n<br />\nBy MICHAEL G. MICHAELSON<br />\nQuietly,suddenly perhaps, with<br />\nresignation, John Lennon sits<br />\ndown in the high thick grass. His<br />\nbrown eyes open wide and innocent, his jaw drops, he seems tired,<br />\nsad,even a little amused. His hands<br />\nlook a bit greenish, clasped there<br />\nover the red gushing mass of blood<br />\nthat had once been his groin.<br />\n\"You didn't expect this,\" he asks<br />\nthe audience in a bored monotone,<br />\n\"did you?\"<br />\nOnly we did. Of course we did.<br />\nNot because we have seen all the<br />\nreviews of How I Won the War<br />\n(which of course we have) not because we have seen the Beatle's<br />\nbattered, bloody body splashed<br />\non the cover of the October Ramparts (which of course we have)<br />\nbut because director Richard Lester makes us expect it and does<br />\neven more. When it does happen,<br />\nhe makes us believe it too.<br />\nAnti-Film Flick<br />\nLester's film is about war and<br />\nwar stories (war movies, war heroes, war villians). The dualism of<br />\nhis subject is a product of Lester's<br />\nconviction not that war and the<br />\ncelebration of war are the same,<br />\nbut that just such a false identity<br />\nhas been so easy and so comfortable to assume, so dishonest and so<br />\nsimply, morally wrong. Lester is<br />\nOut to crush the myths,\"the legacy\" as he told an interviewer,\"of<br />\ntwenty years of fiction,\" and expose the \"implausible, illogical,<br />\nsecret and steel unreality,\" that is<br />\nthe final (and paradoxical and<br />\ncruel) reality of war.<br />\n\"It's not very funny, you<br />\nknow,\" freckle-faced Lieutenant<br />\nGoodbody(Michael Crawford) observes as he explains how he led his<br />\n\u20223rd Troop, 4th Musketeers and<br />\n<br />\nwon the war while on assignment<br />\nto build a cricket pitch behind<br />\nenemy lines in North Africa. But<br />\nit is of course-horribly, slopily,<br />\ngrotesquely funny. It is funny<br />\nwhen the gangling, gung-ho-young<br />\nlieutenant exults jubilantly over<br />\n\"Our first real victory!\" because<br />\nhis men have shot down a British<br />\nplane. \"One of our own of course<br />\nbut still our first real victory.\" It is<br />\nfunny when a woman rushes up<br />\nfrom nowhere, bending over a<br />\nbleeding body with the rapt concern of a cockney Nightengale.<br />\nBoth legs have been blown off.<br />\n\"It hurts Flo,\" the twitching body<br />\nsays. \"Run them under the cold<br />\ntap, luv.\"<br />\nCaught With Pants Down<br />\nIt is funny, not fun. \"I die in<br />\nNorth Africa,\" one of the soldiers<br />\nexplains to us in the beginning. We<br />\nsmile. Then we know he means it.<br />\nBang. With his pants down, hop-<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nping away from the latrines.<br />\n\"We're all going to die under funny names,\" and they do, one by<br />\none, close up, twitching, very real,<br />\nvery funny. And all without realizing their once consuming ambi<br />\ntion, to kill their lieutenant. So<br />\nthat when John gets it between the<br />\nlegs, it is really not so surprising<br />\nIt is very, sadly, comically inevita-.<br />\nble and he(like Paul in Remarque's<br />\nAll Quiet On the Western Front)<br />\nlooks rather relieved that the waiting is over.<br />\nBut Lester's real accomplishment lies in his making the inevitable believable, making us feel<br />\nwhat we know. If his audience left<br />\nthe theater marveling at the revelation that war was not funny but<br />\nabsurd, not nice but sickening, he<br />\nwould not be happy. He wants<br />\nthem to vomit in the streets to remember their nausea the next time<br />\nthey read a body count and the<br />\n(cnntinued to Page 6)<br />\n<br />\nI saw a film today oh boy<br />\nThe English Army had just<br />\nwon the war<br />\nA crowd of people turned<br />\naway<br />\nBut I just had to look<br />\nHaving read the book.<br />\nI'd love to turn you on<br />\n<br />\nIllogical Mystery Mess 4t<br />\nBy PETER HARNIK<br />\nNow that we have all rushed<br />\nout and bought the Beatles' latest<br />\ncontribution to civilization, have<br />\nall studiously poured over the<br />\ntwenty-four pages of cartoons and<br />\nphotos, have all listened meticulously, in all states of conciousness, to the words, guitars, organs,<br />\nbusses and birds, perhaps the album should be subjected to an<br />\nevaluation.<br />\nOf course, it should be stated<br />\nfirst that it is difficult to appraise<br />\nthe six songs on the first side without having seen the Magical Mystery Tour on television. Howevei<br />\nreports from England, where it<br />\nwas shown over Christmas,indicate<br />\nthat the film was about as much a<br />\nlet-down as the album. Anyway,<br />\nmusic should never be dependent<br />\non the eye for success.<br />\nIn the tradition of Sgt.

It in no sense<br />\ncompares with its predecessor, be<br />\ning repetitiously nonsensical, but<br />\nit is an adequate opening track.<br />\nFrom there things go rapidly downhill. \"The Fool on the Hill\" is a<br />\npotentially good song, well-rendered by Paul, but destroyed by an<br />\nugly flute solo and unpleasant<br />\nbacking.

One can't help<br />\nremembering the \"yeah, yeah,<br />\nyeah's\" of yesteryear.<br />\n\"Your Mother Should Know\"<br />\nis even more inane. It is an obvious muscial follow-up to \"When<br />\nI'm 64\" and is simply a case of<br />\ncarrying a bad thing too far.<br />\nWhereas the first song provided a<br />\nrefreshing break from a serious<br />\nand complex series of preceeding<br />\nsongs, \"Your Mother\" is merely a<br />\n<br />\nlot from the sitar and seems to be<br />\nwaste of time.<br />\nThe third track, \"Flying\", is putting it to use in guitar form in<br />\nperhaps the most surprising and a renewed attack against Lucy and<br />\nannoying song on the album.

What annoys though is when<br />\nyou come up with all these reasons<br />\nfor not wanting to be in the middle- class, concerning like \"indivi-<br />\n<br />\nRodin: \"Hurt me,hurt me.\"<br />\n<br />\nGroup photo of all nine lads.<br />\ndualism\" and \"freedom,\"(if there<br />\nis a God, is there also a Hell? said<br />\nthe voice from the 18th century.<br />\nOr:Iam the Walrus. No you're not<br />\nsaid little Nicola.) and \"exploration of the self\" and all that<br />\ndoody, when the problem actually<br />\ncomes down to this: that all middle-class adolescents want to grow<br />\nup and be rich. The only people<br />\nyou find with so little aesthetic<br />\nsensibility, so much vulgarity, as<br />\nto want to be middle-class, of<br />\ncourse,are poor people. And there<br />\nare no poor people here.<br />\nThat nine individual human beings all said that their biggest worry was being middle-class means<br />\neither that they lied or that they<br />\nforgot,for the moment, what they<br />\nare really worried about. Because<br />\nthere are real worries we people<br />\nhave, you know? Very important<br />\nworries, all of them closer to the<br />\ntop of the head than that lousy<br />\nworry. Like drug addiction or<br />\npimples. Or fights with your father, or bacteriological warfare.<br />\nThe War.(I'm worried, Father. My<br />\nwife had a kid they put him onna<br />\ntable and his head rolled alla way<br />\nt' the side like his neck was made<br />\nouta shavin' cream, Father. Now<br />\nshe's gonna have another one an'I<br />\ndon't want that to happen to him.<br />\nWhat am I gonna do?) Death,<br />\n<br />\nbreakage, wear and tear, loneliness. Worry about being a dull<br />\nconversationalist or being unable<br />\nto get it up, or being blind in one<br />\neye. And if you happen to be Negro, your big worry might include<br />\nyour Negroness. Real WORRIES,<br />\nfellas. There is certainly no sense<br />\nworrying about becoming middleclass, because when you are grown<br />\nup you will, like all middle-class<br />\nmen, like your daddies before<br />\nyou, be unaware that you are actually in the middle-class. You'll<br />\nthink there is something more to<br />\nyou, something that sets you<br />\napart. You'll be wrong, but that's<br />\nnot as important as it seems.<br />\nAll in all, a very depressing (if. .<br />\ndiversified) group of interlocutors,<br />\n(Then I would have no reason to<br />\nexist.

The article didn't, as they say, tell it like<br />\nit was. That's an interesting thing<br />\nto know about the Johns Hopkins<br />\n.Journal. Because it is one thing to<br />\nget nine boobs and transcribe the<br />\nrecordings of their inner selves and<br />\nput it on your front page to please<br />\nthe alumni,as it appeared they did.<br />\nThat would be a shame on the.<br />\nstudent body, but what could you<br />\ndo? But it is a whole nother matter entirely to fabricate a set of inner selves, attributing them to the<br />\nnames and faces of nine living<br />\npeople, and dish out the fabrication for the benefit of the old<br />\nfolks with cash and proclivities<br />\ntoward donation.<br />\nThat's a con job, and a great<br />\nAmerican U.like we should not do<br />\nthat.<br />\nAnd to shove the thing under<br />\nthat \"Yes, Virginia, there are students who don't protest,\" head for<br />\npurposes of pleasing all the insurance men and industrial big boys<br />\nwho graduated from Hopkins in<br />\n'38 or '51 - - that's a real insult.<br />\n(Looka this Marcia honey.

A rundown<br />\ntraveler's lodge far back in the<br />\nwilds of Transylvania. A lovely<br />\nyoung barmaid sleeps peacefully<br />\nin her small attic room. Suddenly<br />\nat the window. A dark figure.<br />\nHe enters. Count Dracula! Our<br />\nunsuspecting lass awakes.She gasps<br />\ninstinctively pulling the covers up<br />\nover her. My what a great big<br />\nbountiful body you have, my dear,<br />\nthinks the vampire. Snickering evilly he nears, a bloodsucking gleam<br />\nin his eyes. Helpless innocence<br />\nabout to be ravished. What can<br />\nshe do? Ten thousand kids inhale<br />\nas one, inching up to the edge of<br />\ntheir seats. If only we could<br />\nstop him. But no. We are powerless. The child's fate is sealed. She<br />\n\u2014mu51- accvt her doom with a stout<br />\nheart. The tension has been too<br />\nmuch.

Our call is<br />\nheard. The barmaid reaches back<br />\nremoving our Blessed Saviour from<br />\nthe wall. The vampire lunges forward.She thrusts the cross trimphantly in his face. \"Sic semper<br />\ntyrannis!\" we cry and drop back<br />\ninto our seats relieved of a terrible<br />\nstrain. She's saved. No self-respecting vampire is about to contend<br />\nwith the most sacred relic of the<br />\nchurch. Or so we would have<br />\nthought. This one is utterly undaunted.

This<br />\nis no facile task and it is not surprising that Lester cannot quite<br />\npull it off. But he fails brilliantly<br />\nand with promise. First of all he<br />\npaints death the way she is, messy,<br />\nimmediate, ubiquitous, inevitable.<br />\nThen he assails the rationale of<br />\nwar: \"I fought for three reasons,\"<br />\nPrivate Dimwitty(Lennon) muses,<br />\n\"only I can't remember what they<br />\nwere.\" The pragmatic approach to<br />\nmorality. \"Do you hate Jews.\"<br />\nGoodbody asks a German officer.<br />\n\"Oh no!

Prominent among them<br />\nis his mocking of other World War<br />\nII movies and his brilliant interweaving of newsreel footage of the<br />\nwar. The first technique represents<br />\nmost explicitly Lester's quarrel<br />\nwith the \"legacy of fiction\" which<br />\nhas grown up around this war and<br />\nall of them, the stupid celebration<br />\nof what can only be mourned.<br />\nWhen the trucks roll across the desert we hear the same theme music<br />\nof Lawrence of Arabia that echoed<br />\nin our ears at Oscar time. When the<br />\nBritish misfits encounter a large<br />\nGerman encampment and are<br />\nhopelessly outnumbered, they<br />\nsimply march single file into the<br />\nmiddle of the camp, resolutely<br />\nwhistling the theme song from<br />\n<br />\nThe Bridge on the River Kwai,<br />\nwhereupon the terrified Germans<br />\nthrow up their hands in impotent<br />\nastonishment and defeat.<br />\nThe use of newsreels is nothing<br />\nOccasionally<br />\nshort of brilliant.<br />\nthroughout the film a still picture<br />\nflashes on the screen, a comicbook illustration of a famous battle.

In<br />\nthis act of conscious art-making,<br />\nsoldier and actor, past and fiction<br />\nmerge magnificiently. If Lester's<br />\nfilm is funny, so is Dunkirk. If<br />\nDunkirk was tragic, so is Lester's<br />\nfilm. Distinctions are blurred, the<br />\ngap is bridged. At the end of each<br />\nnewsreel sequence, one man, more<br />\nof the British patrol has died. In a<br />\nfinal coup, Lester fills his place<br />\nwith a new (or old or eternal) man,<br />\npainted from head to toe the color<br />\nof the newsreel from which he has<br />\nemerged.

Although<br />\nabout 500 adult penguins are still<br />\nalive, Dr. Sladen reported that all<br />\nthe chicks and unhatched eggs<br />\nwere smashed or blown into the<br />\nsea<br />\nThe Emperor penguin stands<br />\nthree feet high and may weigh<br />\nninety pounds. The females, however, lay only a single egg each,<br />\nand it is feared that one or two<br />\nmore severe winters may endanger<br />\nthe species.

Together<br />\nthey compiled a 1-5 record, struggled to fill all the events and beat<br />\nF&M in the seasons' finale only<br />\nbecause the Diplomats had less<br />\nswimmers than the Jays. Only<br />\nthree members of that unknown<br />\ncrew remained, but the progress<br />\nHopkins has made is, if anything,<br />\nin inverse relation to the number<br />\nof swimmers.<br />\nDo It Yourself<br />\nThe credit for the improvement<br />\nmust be given to the swimmers. In<br />\na sport where teamwork is a minimal requirement, each individual<br />\nmember must assume a responsibility to drive himself to the utmost. Not everyone can; and this<br />\nmay explain the small size of this<br />\nyear's varsity (there are twelve<br />\nswimmers and two divers). As yet<br />\nhowever, there remain few top<br />\nswimmers at Hopkins. Aside from<br />\nChernick and Weikel, and diver<br />\nWilson who win consistently, the<br />\nJays will never be able to handle<br />\nYale, USC,Stanford,or even Bucknell. On a nation-wide scale Hopkins swimming is at best mediocre; but there is no reason why it<br />\nhas to remain that way.<br />\nCoaching is Key Factor<br />\nThe answer to mediocrity is<br />\ncoaching. Since one must be driven<br />\nto produce top times, the necessity<br />\nfor a domineering coach is paramount. Leo Durocher said, \"Nice<br />\nguys finish last\", and thus far the<br />\nswimming team has proven his<br />\npoint. What the Jays have acomplished this year has been almost<br />\nin spite of, not because of, the<br />\ncoaching and entire administrative<br />\nsetup for the swimming team. The<br />\npool has been closed for days for<br />\nrepairs. Training meals before away<br />\nhave failed to materialize, and the<br />\n<br />\ncoach himself has often missed<br />\npractice of left early. The Santa<br />\nClara swim club has proven that<br />\nthe only way to develop top swimmers is to swim, \u2014 miles and miles.<br />\nThus far, the Jays have been lucky<br />\nto log one mile a day. Stamina and<br />\nconditioning the key elements of<br />\ngood swimmers have not been developed, and the Jays will remain<br />\nmediocre until they are.<br />\nSwimmers will Work<br />\nIt is a shame too, because good<br />\ntough workouts will produce the<br />\nphyschological as well as thephysical lift needed for victory. The<br />\nJays last relay loss to defending<br />\nMAC champ Dickinson, \u2014 exemplifies this point. The toughness<br />\ningrained into championship teams<br />\nin any sport begins with tough,<br />\nhard-nosed coaching. The team<br />\ncannot drive itself. Only a top<br />\nflight coach will be able to develop<br />\na Hopkins swimming team comparable to the quality of the pool<br />\nit swims in.<br />\nThe freshman swimming team<br />\nis in the process of developing.<br />\nProbably the strongest squad<br />\nHopkins has had, the Baby Jays<br />\nhave been greatly strenghtened by<br />\nthe addition of Mike O'Donnell<br />\nwhose breaststroke times have<br />\nbeen the best ever recorded by a<br />\nHopkins swimmer.<br />\nAfter nipping Bainbridge Prep<br />\nin their season's opener the frosh<br />\nswamped both Gettysburg and<br />\nSouthern High School before bowing to Delaware.<br />\nNucleus Developed<br />\nIf the purpose of a freshman<br />\nteam is to develop candidates for<br />\nvarsity positions, then the freshman are more than fulfilling their<br />\nobligations.

Since the bill will undoubtedly be notable more for what it<br />\ndoes not contain than for what it<br />\ndoes, it is perhaps a bit early to<br />\ncriticize it. However, even .in the<br />\nexcerpt that appearedin the NewsLetter there are tiems that are not<br />\nonly useless but positively harmful.<br />\nConsider, for example, Point<br />\nFour, which concerns the NewsLetter directly: \"No student publication shall be subjected to any<br />\nform of censorship so long as it<br /><br />\nremains within the limits of acceptable community standards\"? Would thi!<br />\nmean a ban on four-letter words?<br />\nMost members of the university<br />\ncommunity use four-letter words<br />\nin their speech. Would an article<br />\nby a member of the NLFSV bc<br />\npermitted to appear? Many Hopkins students support a policy<br />\nthat says that members of the<br />\nNLFSV should be killed. The<br />\npeople who are to define \"acceptable community standards\"<br />\nare faced with a difficult task<br />\nindeed.<br />\nBut more important than the<br />\ndifficulty of defining these standards are the insidious implications of even trying. The editors<br />\nof the News-Letter are entrusted<br />\nwith an important job. They<br />\nshould also be trusted to use their<br />\nown judgment when it comes to<br />\ndeciding what to print without<br />\nhaving to worry about \"acceptable community standards,\" real<br />\nor imagined. An important function of the student - - or any - press can be to try to change<br />\nthese standards.

The administration finally does something nice<br />\nfor its students and what thanks<br />\ndo they receive? Sarcasm! I am<br />\nnot saying that there aren't way<br />\nto improve this program, but this<br />\nis certainly a start.

Franke<br /><br />\nThe Yearning Years<br />\nIn retrospect, a college \"education\" must seem a cruel paradox. If<br />\nwe have learned anything from four years of lectures, seminars,<br />\nexams and papers it is the harsh realization of how much remains<br />\nunlearned. A semester of Dante teaches us how inadequate one semester can be. We learn enough to become curious, enough to become<br />\ninterested, but in the last analysis, not nearly enough. College teases<br />\nus but we can't get no satisfaction. It takes us half way there, if that<br />\nfar.<br />\nThe pressure to specialize pours salt on the wound. It is as strong<br />\nat Hopkins as anywhere, perhaps stronger. The pre-med, with Mitochondria and adenosine triphosphate burdening his mind, has only<br />\nvague recollections of Homer and Hegel.The history major associates<br />\nchemistry with lysergic acid and spends his waking hours absorbed in<br />\nthe revisionist theories of the revisionist, who revised the revisionist<br />\ninterpretation of the origins of the Civil War. The Hopkins student<br />\nmay gain some expertise in a narrow field of study while in other<br />\ndisciplines he remains functionally illiterate.<br />\nIn this sense, the University may be at fault. We are always told<br />\nabout the virtues of our liberal academic philosophy, struck from<br />\nthe mold of German universities. Hopkins is, in fact, a ;staunch defender of academic freedom and it is indeed a more desirable educational philosophy than that practiced by a Princeton or Chicago<br />\nwhere rigidity is the by-word. The freedom to structure one's education almost free of insipid requirements should not be taken lightly.<br />\nThe reality of this liberal philosophy, however, has not created the<br />\n\"Renaissance man\" at Hopkins nor has it created anything more<br />\nthan an incipient specialist.<br />\nThe fault does not, however,lie with Lincoln Gordon,or his nine<br />\npredecessors,or the faculty,or the student. The roots of the problem<br />\nmust be traced back to the day one enters public school for the first<br />\ntime. The tragedy of the Hopkins student is that the liberal, progressive philosophy of his college does not jive with the rigid conservatism that governs the first twelve years of his education. In essence,<br />\na liberal philosophy of higher education assumes that the individual<br />\npossesses a high degree of technical knowledge and that a college<br />\nshould stress development of the analytical powers of reasoning. This<br />\nis a false assumption since the products of the public school system<br />\nare ill-prepared to cope with anything more provocative than Introductory Chemistry or History.<br />\nConsequently, Hopkins and other surveyors of academic freedom<br />\nmust keep a stiff upper lip and give their entering students cram<br />\ncourses in the fundamentals of Biology and Sociology. It is not until the third or fourth year that the student is asked to use his mind<br />\nand manipulate ideas, but by that time his intellectual curiosity is<br />\nworn thin by chemical formulas and historical dates.<br />\nThe blame, as we said, lies squarely with the American system of<br />\npublic education. Numerous attempts have been made to reform<br />\n\"the system\" but bureaucratization has rendered them futile. Recently, a committee chaired by McGeorge Bundy of the Ford<br />\nThundation suggested to Mayor Lindsay of New York a sweeping<br />\ndecentralization of that city's school system. The committee's report<br />\nproposed the creation of 30 to 60 largely autonomous school districts with each district run by a local school board. These local<br />\nschool boards would have the power to hire and fire superintendants<br />\nand teachers,determine curricula and make decisions on tenure. As a<br />\na result, the Board of Education would be restricted to the role of an<br />\noverseer. But the Bundy Report and any other plan for school decentralization is destined to fail unless basic changes are made in the<br />\nclassroom.<br />\nPsychologists have been saying for years that the youngster is<br />\ncapable of a much higher level of reasoning and understanding than<br />\nboth his teachers and parents give him credit. The absudity of a college student clutching a Spanish elements book is a severe indictment of his elementary school years. While he was playing with<br />\nblocks and coloring pretty pictures, his mind was capable of a greater challenge-only the challenge never came.<br />\nThis process of intellectual retardation leads to the great myths<br />\nthat students acquire in high school. The industrial revolution is<br />\nglorified while some of its more iunfortunate creations are totally<br />\nignored. Wars are exciting and colorful, not brutal and unbearable.<br />\nThere have been some energetic people who tried to fight the<br />\nsystem, but they,like all the utopians before them, suffered ignominious defeat. Jonathan Kozol was kicked out of a Boston school<br />\nfor reading a Langston Hughes poem to his class and Herbert Kohl's<br />\nsixth grade class in Harlem was forced to publish secretly a newspaper which expressed the fears and horrors of the ghetto. The system<br />\nhad driven them underground.<br />\nThe system is bureaucratic, insensitive,rigid and worst of all - the<br />\ndestroyer of people's minds. It is, therefore, the unwanted duty of<br />\ninstitutions like Hopkins to reclaim, and regenerate the once promising intellects of its students. In this process, the tenets of academic freedom are necessarily neglected. This is indeed tragic but<br />\nHopkins will be forced to turn out unsatisfactory products as long<br />\nas she is faced with the task of revitalizing the minds of her students.<br />\nThe cruel paradox of college education will persist until the public<br />\nschool system with the help of progressive universities turns'inward<br />\nand destroys those structures that contribute so heavily to the intellectual retardation of the student.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE,JANUARY 19, 1968<br /><br />\nLester: Gut Coarse<br /><br />\nBy MICHAEL G. MICHAELSON<br />\nQuietly,suddenly perhaps, with<br />\nresignation, John Lennon sits<br />\ndown in the high thick grass. His<br />\nbrown eyes open wide and innocent, his jaw drops, he seems tired,<br />\nsad,even a little amused. His hands<br />\nlook a bit greenish, clasped there<br />\nover the red gushing mass of blood<br />\nthat had once been his groin.<br />\n\"You didn't expect this,\" he asks<br />\nthe audience in a bored monotone,<br />\n\"did you?\"<br />\nOnly we did. Of course we did.<br />\nNot because we have seen all the<br />\nreviews of How I Won the War<br />\n(which of course we have) not because we have seen the Beatle's<br />\nbattered, bloody body splashed<br />\non the cover of the October Ramparts (which of course we have)<br />\nbut because director Richard Lester makes us expect it and does<br />\neven more. When it does happen,<br />\nhe makes us believe it too.<br />\nAnti-Film Flick<br />\nLester's film is about war and<br />\nwar stories (war movies, war heroes, war villians). The dualism of<br />\nhis subject is a product of Lester's<br />\nconviction not that war and the<br />\ncelebration of war are the same,<br />\nbut that just such a false identity<br />\nhas been so easy and so comfortable to assume, so dishonest and so<br />\nsimply, morally wrong. Lester is<br />\nOut to crush the myths,\"the legacy\" as he told an interviewer,\"of<br />\ntwenty years of fiction,\" and expose the \"implausible, illogical,<br />\nsecret and steel unreality,\" that is<br />\nthe final (and paradoxical and<br />\ncruel) reality of war.<br />\n\"It's not very funny, you<br />\nknow,\" freckle-faced Lieutenant<br />\nGoodbody(Michael Crawford) observes as he explains how he led his<br />\n\u20223rd Troop, 4th Musketeers and<br /><br />\nwon the war while on assignment<br />\nto build a cricket pitch behind<br />\nenemy lines in North Africa. But<br />\nit is of course-horribly, slopily,<br />\ngrotesquely funny. It is funny<br />\nwhen the gangling, gung-ho-young<br />\nlieutenant exults jubilantly over<br />\n\"Our first real victory!\" because<br />\nhis men have shot down a British<br />\nplane. \"One of our own of course<br />\nbut still our first real victory.\" It is<br />\nfunny when a woman rushes up<br />\nfrom nowhere, bending over a<br />\nbleeding body with the rapt concern of a cockney Nightengale.<br />\nBoth legs have been blown off.<br />\n\"It hurts Flo,\" the twitching body<br />\nsays. \"Run them under the cold<br />\ntap, luv.\"<br />\nCaught With Pants Down<br />\nIt is funny, not fun. \"I die in<br />\nNorth Africa,\" one of the soldiers<br />\nexplains to us in the beginning. We<br />\nsmile. Then we know he means it.<br />\nBang. With his pants down, hop-<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nping away from the latrines.<br />\n\"We're all going to die under funny names,\" and they do, one by<br />\none, close up, twitching, very real,<br />\nvery funny. And all without realizing their once consuming ambi<br />\ntion, to kill their lieutenant. So<br />\nthat when John gets it between the<br />\nlegs, it is really not so surprising<br />\nIt is very, sadly, comically inevita-.<br />\nble and he(like Paul in Remarque's<br />\nAll Quiet On the Western Front)<br />\nlooks rather relieved that the waiting is over.<br />\nBut Lester's real accomplishment lies in his making the inevitable believable, making us feel<br />\nwhat we know. If his audience left<br />\nthe theater marveling at the revelation that war was not funny but<br />\nabsurd, not nice but sickening, he<br />\nwould not be happy. He wants<br />\nthem to vomit in the streets to remember their nausea the next time<br />\nthey read a body count and the<br />\n(cnntinued to Page 6)<br /><br />\nI saw a film today oh boy<br />\nThe English Army had just<br />\nwon the war<br />\nA crowd of people turned<br />\naway<br />\nBut I just had to look<br />\nHaving read the book.<br />\nI'd love to turn you on<br /><br />\nIllogical Mystery Mess 4t<br />\nBy PETER HARNIK<br />\nNow that we have all rushed<br />\nout and bought the Beatles' latest<br />\ncontribution to civilization, have<br />\nall studiously poured over the<br />\ntwenty-four pages of cartoons and<br />\nphotos, have all listened meticulously, in all states of conciousness, to the words, guitars, organs,<br />\nbusses and birds, perhaps the album should be subjected to an<br />\nevaluation.<br />\nOf course, it should be stated<br />\nfirst that it is difficult to appraise<br />\nthe six songs on the first side without having seen the Magical Mystery Tour on television. Howevei<br />\nreports from England, where it<br />\nwas shown over Christmas,indicate<br />\nthat the film was about as much a<br />\nlet-down as the album. Anyway,<br />\nmusic should never be dependent<br />\non the eye for success.<br />\nIn the tradition of Sgt. Pepper's<br />\nLonely Hearts Club Band, the<br />\nMagical Mystery Tour opens with<br />\nits title tune, a fast-paced,exciting,<br />\nintroductory song. It in no sense<br />\ncompares with its predecessor, be<br />\ning repetitiously nonsensical, but<br />\nit is an adequate opening track.<br />\nFrom there things go rapidly downhill. \"The Fool on the Hill\" is a<br />\npotentially good song, well-rendered by Paul, but destroyed by an<br />\nugly flute solo and unpleasant<br />\nbacking. It, is a shame that the<br />\nsong has to depend on Paul's<br />\n\"oh's\" for support. One can't help<br />\nremembering the \"yeah, yeah,<br />\nyeah's\" of yesteryear.<br />\n\"Your Mother Should Know\"<br />\nis even more inane. It is an obvious muscial follow-up to \"When<br />\nI'm 64\" and is simply a case of<br />\ncarrying a bad thing too far.<br />\nWhereas the first song provided a<br />\nrefreshing break from a serious<br />\nand complex series of preceeding<br />\nsongs, \"Your Mother\" is merely a<br /><br />\nlot from the sitar and seems to be<br />\nwaste of time.<br />\nThe third track, \"Flying\", is putting it to use in guitar form in<br />\nperhaps the most surprising and a renewed attack against Lucy and<br />\nannoying song on the album. It is, her drugs. The spooky, depressing<br />\nin effect, a \"blues dirge\" followed, atonality, punctuated with the<br />\nwithout reason, by 37 seconds of \"don't belong's\" almost give the<br />\nelectronic feedback.

On reading,<br />\nthat was rather embarrassing,<br />\ndon't you think? Embarrassing<br />\nthat nine students, each so unique,<br />\nso singular and distinct from the<br />\nrest, could come up with nine absolutely identical answers to any<br />\nquestion put to them. After all<br />\n(one is forced to think) there,<br />\naround that dinner table was all<br />\nthe diversity our little University<br />\ncould ever hope to muster \u2014 a<br />\nWhite Anglo Saxon Protestant was<br />\nthere, along with a person of Italian dissent, a person of Jewish<br />\ndissent and a person of colored<br />\ndissent. And there was the son of<br />\nthe famous French sculptor, August Rodin, and there was the<br />\ngrandson of a famous poet (I forget who) and it seems that this<br />\nprestigious assemblage could have<br />\nproduced something a little classier<br />\nthan those bread-thoughts presented,in the Journal.<br />\nListen to this question: \"If you<br />\nwere suddenly to find yourself in<br />\na position of power, what would<br />\nyou do with it?\" Does it not shame<br />\nyou that when nine Hopkins boys<br />\nwere asked that question each one<br />\nsaid that he would make this a better world in which to live? There<br />\nis no conceivable way they could<br />\nhave demonstrated less intelligence<br />\nor comprehension of the way<br />\nthings are than by saying a thing<br />\nlike that.<br />\n(\"I'd make a happy, teeny bopper world. I'd like to see poverty<br />\nended and I would use Lyndon<br />\nJohnson\u2014like programs all day<br />\nlong. I think they're great.\")<br />\nA better world in which to live.<br />\nWhat could that mean? One of<br />\nthem even suggested he'd \"form a<br />\nuniform program to promote understanding of people's goals,\" and<br />\nother things to that effect. Answers like that, buddy,come from<br />\nMiss America contestants when<br />\nthey yuk it up with Bert Parks,<br />\nnot topnotch whiz kids in the political sciences. I mean nobody -not a single one \u2014 had a viable,<br />\nspecific plan for the utilization of<br />\nall that power. Nobody said, for<br />\ninstance, that they would take all<br />\nthe money away from the rich<br />\npeople and give it to the poor people. Nobody said they would stop<br />\nthe war or build highways or pass<br />\ngun legislation (\"It's easy to debate issues, but problems can't be<br /><br />\nSmifty:\"At Hopkins I can be myself.\"<br /><br />\nJames the Elephant: \"can't believe in the<br />\nmiddle\"<br />\ndebated.\")or effect free telephone<br />\nservice or kill the Jews or force<br />\nlittle girls to give them pleasure.<br />\nNothing! Just better. A better<br />\nworld in. which to live. That's not<br />\nusing the old bean when that's as<br />\nfar as your thinking goes. That's<br />\nbeing a little fool, when you talk<br />\nlike that.<br />\nBut as thoughtless as the fellas<br />\nwere in answering the big power<br />\nquestion, they outdid themselves<br />\nwhen it came to: \"If you worry,<br />\nwhat do you worry about?\" (I<br />\nworry about becoming a fat and<br />\nhappy businessman, he said) Because then they really sounded<br />\nteeny weeny. It seems what worried them most, under all the<br />\nsmoke, was the idea of growing up<br />\nto be members of the middle-class.<br />\nThis is, of course, not a new<br />\nTsouris among the sons of the middle class and drive a 2-door Ford<br />\nsedan and haul ass to the PTA<br />\nevery week and read Book-Of-theMonth Club selections, and have<br />\nyour kids think you're a dumbass<br />\nfor sending them to college and<br />\nworking hard. Nobody wants that,<br />\nno sir, and neither do the normal<br />\nnine. What annoys though is when<br />\nyou come up with all these reasons<br />\nfor not wanting to be in the middle- class, concerning like \"indivi-<br /><br />\nRodin: \"Hurt me,hurt me.\"<br /><br />\nGroup photo of all nine lads.<br />\ndualism\" and \"freedom,\"(if there<br />\nis a God, is there also a Hell? said<br />\nthe voice from the 18th century.<br />\nOr:Iam the Walrus. No you're not<br />\nsaid little Nicola.) and \"exploration of the self\" and all that<br />\ndoody, when the problem actually<br />\ncomes down to this: that all middle-class adolescents want to grow<br />\nup and be rich. The only people<br />\nyou find with so little aesthetic<br />\nsensibility, so much vulgarity, as<br />\nto want to be middle-class, of<br />\ncourse,are poor people. And there<br />\nare no poor people here.<br />\nThat nine individual human beings all said that their biggest worry was being middle-class means<br />\neither that they lied or that they<br />\nforgot,for the moment, what they<br />\nare really worried about. Because<br />\nthere are real worries we people<br />\nhave, you know? Very important<br />\nworries, all of them closer to the<br />\ntop of the head than that lousy<br />\nworry. Like drug addiction or<br />\npimples. Or fights with your father, or bacteriological warfare.<br />\nThe War.(I'm worried, Father. My<br />\nwife had a kid they put him onna<br />\ntable and his head rolled alla way<br />\nt' the side like his neck was made<br />\nouta shavin' cream, Father. Now<br />\nshe's gonna have another one an'I<br />\ndon't want that to happen to him.<br />\nWhat am I gonna do?) Death,<br /><br />\nbreakage, wear and tear, loneliness. Worry about being a dull<br />\nconversationalist or being unable<br />\nto get it up, or being blind in one<br />\neye. And if you happen to be Negro, your big worry might include<br />\nyour Negroness. Real WORRIES,<br />\nfellas. There is certainly no sense<br />\nworrying about becoming middleclass, because when you are grown<br />\nup you will, like all middle-class<br />\nmen, like your daddies before<br />\nyou, be unaware that you are actually in the middle-class. You'll<br />\nthink there is something more to<br />\nyou, something that sets you<br />\napart. You'll be wrong, but that's<br />\nnot as important as it seems.<br />\nAll in all, a very depressing (if. .<br />\ndiversified) group of interlocutors,<br />\n(Then I would have no reason to<br />\nexist.

Because it is one thing to<br />\nget nine boobs and transcribe the<br />\nrecordings of their inner selves and<br />\nput it on your front page to please<br />\nthe alumni,as it appeared they did.<br />\nThat would be a shame on the.<br />\nstudent body, but what could you<br />\ndo? But it is a whole nother matter entirely to fabricate a set of inner selves, attributing them to the<br />\nnames and faces of nine living<br />\npeople, and dish out the fabrication for the benefit of the old<br />\nfolks with cash and proclivities<br />\ntoward donation.<br />\nThat's a con job, and a great<br />\nAmerican U.like we should not do<br />\nthat.<br />\nAnd to shove the thing under<br />\nthat \"Yes, Virginia, there are students who don't protest,\" head for<br />\npurposes of pleasing all the insurance men and industrial big boys<br />\nwho graduated from Hopkins in<br />\n'38 or '51 - - that's a real insult.<br />\n(Looka this Marcia honey.

If<br />\nDunkirk was tragic, so is Lester's<br />\nfilm. Distinctions are blurred, the<br />\ngap is bridged. At the end of each<br />\nnewsreel sequence, one man, more<br />\nof the British patrol has died.

A<br />\nreport has just come in from Johns<br />\nHopkins Professor William Sladen<br />\nwhich indicates that the Emperor<br />\npenguin rookery at Cape Croizier,<br />\nAntarctica, has been devastated by<br />\na furious storm over the past<br />\nwinter.<br />\nAlthough it is the summer now<br />\nin Antarctica, Dr. Sladen's party<br />\nhas only recently been able to<br />\nreach the famous rookery to witness the destruction. Although<br />\nabout 500 adult penguins are still<br />\nalive, Dr. Sladen reported that all<br />\nthe chicks and unhatched eggs<br />\nwere smashed or blown into the<br />\nsea<br />\nThe Emperor penguin stands<br />\nthree feet high and may weigh<br />\nninety pounds.

Altogether he has spent<br />\nover seven years in Antarctica.

Together<br />\nthey compiled a 1-5 record, struggled to fill all the events and beat<br />\nF&amp;M in the seasons' finale only<br />\nbecause the Diplomats had less<br />\nswimmers than the Jays. Only<br />\nthree members of that unknown<br />\ncrew remained, but the progress<br />\nHopkins has made is, if anything,<br />\nin inverse relation to the number<br />\nof swimmers.<br />\nDo It Yourself<br />\nThe credit for the improvement<br />\nmust be given to the swimmers. In<br />\na sport where teamwork is a minimal requirement, each individual<br />\nmember must assume a responsibility to drive himself to the utmost. Not everyone can; and this<br />\nmay explain the small size of this<br />\nyear's varsity (there are twelve<br />\nswimmers and two divers). As yet<br />\nhowever, there remain few top<br />\nswimmers at Hopkins. Aside from<br />\nChernick and Weikel, and diver<br />\nWilson who win consistently, the<br />\nJays will never be able to handle<br />\nYale, USC,Stanford,or even Bucknell. On a nation-wide scale Hopkins swimming is at best mediocre; but there is no reason why it<br />\nhas to remain that way.<br />\nCoaching is Key Factor<br />\nThe answer to mediocrity is<br />\ncoaching. Since one must be driven<br />\nto produce top times, the necessity<br />\nfor a domineering coach is paramount. Leo Durocher said, \"Nice<br />\nguys finish last\", and thus far the<br />\nswimming team has proven his<br />\npoint. What the Jays have acomplished this year has been almost<br />\nin spite of, not because of, the<br />\ncoaching and entire administrative<br />\nsetup for the swimming team. The<br />\npool has been closed for days for<br />\nrepairs. Training meals before away<br />\nhave failed to materialize, and the<br /><br />\ncoach himself has often missed<br />\npractice of left early. The Santa<br />\nClara swim club has proven that<br />\nthe only way to develop top swimmers is to swim, \u2014 miles and miles.<br />\nThus far, the Jays have been lucky<br />\nto log one mile a day. Stamina and<br />\nconditioning the key elements of<br />\ngood swimmers have not been developed, and the Jays will remain<br />\nmediocre until they are.<br />\nSwimmers will Work<br />\nIt is a shame too, because good<br />\ntough workouts will produce the<br />\nphyschological as well as thephysical lift needed for victory. The<br />\nJays last relay loss to defending<br />\nMAC champ Dickinson, \u2014 exemplifies this point. The toughness<br />\ningrained into championship teams<br />\nin any sport begins with tough,<br />\nhard-nosed coaching. The team<br />\ncannot drive itself. Only a top<br />\nflight coach will be able to develop<br />\na Hopkins swimming team comparable to the quality of the pool<br />\nit swims in.<br />\nThe freshman swimming team<br />\nis in the process of developing.<br />\nProbably the strongest squad<br />\nHopkins has had, the Baby Jays<br />\nhave been greatly strenghtened by<br />\nthe addition of Mike O'Donnell<br />\nwhose breaststroke times have<br />\nbeen the best ever recorded by a<br />\nHopkins swimmer.<br />\nAfter nipping Bainbridge Prep<br />\nin their season's opener the frosh<br />\nswamped both Gettysburg and<br />\nSouthern High School before bowing to Delaware.<br />\nNucleus Developed<br />\nIf the purpose of a freshman<br />\nteam is to develop candidates for<br />\nvarsity positions, then the freshman are more than fulfilling their<br />\nobligations.
