This year the cross country team<br />\nwas sent into intercollegiate competition without a coach. Mr.<br />\nTurner claimed no<br />\ncompetent men were available, listed himself as<br />\ncoach, and then let<br />\nTom Stone, the captain of the team, run the<br />\nteam with no aid from<br />\nthe athletic office.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe Department was fortunate in having<br />\na man of Stone's<br />\ncaliber who was able to step in and do a creditabl<br />\ne job of coaching.<br />\nHowever, the department tried to stretch Mr.<br />\nStone's abilities too<br />\nfar. They sent no one from the departme<br />\nnt to help him coaA<br />\nboth the varsity and freshman teams at the<br />\nDelaware meet and<br />\nas a result he had practically no warm up<br />\ntime for himself. He<br />\nthus left himself open to permanent injury,<br />\nwhich seemed to<br />\nmake little difference to the athletic administr<br />\nators, who continued to let him handle the job alone.<br />\nThen last week the team received the crushing<br />\nblow from the<br />\nathletic department. Although the squad had gone<br />\nthrough its<br />\ndual meet season undefeated, the administrators<br />\nfelt that the<br />\nrunners did not warrant official coaching representation<br />\nfrom the<br />\nschool at the annual Middle Atlantic Championship race. Although<br />\nBill Maginnis was sent along as Mr. Turner's represent<br />\native he 3400 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nhad little more official power than a manager.

The school is the little co-ed<br />\ncollege from up Westminster way called Western Maryland.<br />\nIn our thirty-one football contests with the Terrors numerous<br />\npeculiarities have occurred.<br />\nAfter a careful check of the record books, here is some of the<br />\nmost interesting data that struck our eyes: The series began<br />\nway back in 1894 with the Westminster lads the victors ...<br />\nHopkins has shut the Terrors out 12 times, including a 0-0 tie<br />\nin 1904 ... Most overwhelming victories were, for Hopkins a<br />\n49-0 one in 1920; and for Western Maryland a 40 to 0 win in<br />\n1931 ... The longest number of consecutive wins was registered by<br />\nHopkins in five years from 1919 to 1923. We won by 31-6, 44-0,<br />\n35-0, and 17-0 scores ... One of the most thrilling of the series<br />\nwas 7-6 triumph for the Jays to complete their last undefeated<br />\nseason on record (1948) ... The 1904 game was called because of<br />\na fight. This last statement was exceptionally attractive to The<br />\nNester's eye so he proceeded to investigate it more thoroughly.<br />\nRocky And Undulating Cornfield<br />\n<br />\ncheck of the November 8, 1904 copy of the News-Letter<br />\nuncovered a most vivid description of the story. It told of 25<br />\nto 30 rooters attending the game at Westminster on the 29th of<br />\nOctober that year, which to this day remains an interesting and<br />\npeculiar contest., The paper described the playing field as a<br />\n\"rocky and undulating cornfield,\" which bore no trace of line<br />\nmarkings. It told of the players making the long half-mile trek<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nfrom the dressing rooms to the field over the cow paths.<br />\nThe first half was scoreless with both teams threatening often<br />\nbut in most cases being turned back by either corn stalks or small<br />\nboulders, both of which were numerous over the surface. It was in<br />\nthe beginning of the second half that the outstanding peculiarity<br />\noccurred. Hopkins had kicked off to the home team and held them<br />\nfor two downs when on third down the Terrors attempted a run<br />\naround left end. It sems as though the ball carrier fumbled and<br />\nof.Hopkins pounced on the pigskin.

As<br />\nMcl/mald had scruples about the humoring of spoiled children,<br />\nhe refused to comply and was sustained by the decision of the<br />\nreferee. Western Maryland carried out their threat and left the<br />\nfield. As the ball was still inplay our men carried it up for a<br />\ntouchdown. At this point, one of the Western Maryland backs<br />\noame out on the field and wanted to fight with Blanck (our fullback). The latter was accommodating arid the challenger woke up<br />\nsome ten feet away.\"<br />\nVillage Constables And Imaginary Touchdowns<br />\n<br />\n\"The field then swarmed with the rooters of both teams and<br />\nfor a few moments things were lively.

Hopkins<br />\nthen left the field and after they had disappeared Western Maryland recovered from their sulkiness,-and proceeded to run from<br />\ngoal to goal scoring imaginary touchdowns, while their rooters<br />\nshrieked with hysterical glee. The referee, however, decided that<br />\nthe score shold be 0-0.\"<br />\nWhen Coach Bridgers and his men step on to the Hbmewood gridiron tomorrow -there will undoubtedly be a thought in<br />\nhis and everyone else's mind of just how much better our season<br />\nrecord would look with a win over the Terrors.

This year the cross country team<br />\nwas sent into intercollegiate competition without a coach.

He<br />\nthus left himself open to permanent injury,<br />\nwhich seemed to<br />\nmake little difference to the athletic administr<br />\nators, who continued to let him handle the job alone.<br />\nThen last week the team received the crushing<br />\nblow from the<br />\nathletic department. Although the squad had gone<br />\nthrough its<br />\ndual meet season undefeated, the administrators<br />\nfelt that the<br />\nrunners did not warrant official coaching representation<br />\nfrom the<br />\nschool at the annual Middle Atlantic Championship race.

The school is the little co-ed<br />\ncollege from up Westminster way called Western Maryland.<br />\nIn our thirty-one football contests with the Terrors numerous<br />\npeculiarities have occurred.<br />\nAfter a careful check of the record books, here is some of the<br />\nmost interesting data that struck our eyes: The series began<br />\nway back in 1894 with the Westminster lads the victors ...<br />\nHopkins has shut the Terrors out 12 times, including a 0-0 tie<br />\nin 1904 ... Most overwhelming victories were, for Hopkins a<br />\n49-0 one in 1920; and for Western Maryland a 40 to 0 win in<br />\n1931 ... The longest number of consecutive wins was registered by<br />\nHopkins in five years from 1919 to 1923. We won by 31-6, 44-0,<br />\n35-0, and 17-0 scores ... One of the most thrilling of the series<br />\nwas 7-6 triumph for the Jays to complete their last undefeated<br />\nseason on record (1948) ... The 1904 game was called because of<br />\na fight. This last statement was exceptionally attractive to The<br />\nNester's eye so he proceeded to investigate it more thoroughly.<br />\nRocky And Undulating Cornfield<br /><br />\ncheck of the November 8, 1904 copy of the News-Letter<br />\nuncovered a most vivid description of the story. It told of 25<br />\nto 30 rooters attending the game at Westminster on the 29th of<br />\nOctober that year, which to this day remains an interesting and<br />\npeculiar contest., The paper described the playing field as a<br />\n\"rocky and undulating cornfield,\" which bore no trace of line<br />\nmarkings. It told of the players making the long half-mile trek<br />\nA<br /><br />\nfrom the dressing rooms to the field over the cow paths.<br />\nThe first half was scoreless with both teams threatening often<br />\nbut in most cases being turned back by either corn stalks or small<br />\nboulders, both of which were numerous over the surface. It was in<br />\nthe beginning of the second half that the outstanding peculiarity<br />\noccurred. Hopkins had kicked off to the home team and held them<br />\nfor two downs when on third down the Terrors attempted a run<br />\naround left end.

As<br />\nMcl/mald had scruples about the humoring of spoiled children,<br />\nhe refused to comply and was sustained by the decision of the<br />\nreferee.
