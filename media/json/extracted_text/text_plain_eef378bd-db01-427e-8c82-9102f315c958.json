Summary<br />\n<br />\nProject Objectives<br />\n<br />\nThe shopping districts established in the older<br />\nresidential districts of our cities have problems<br />\nsimilar to those of the central business districts.<br />\nUnlike the CBD areas, these districts have<br />\nneither the plans, the organizational structure<br />\nto put the plans into effect, nor the<br />\ncommitment of local resources and programs<br />\nthat the CBD areas are increasingly receiving.<br />\n<br />\nThis project was designed to carry out a<br />\nplanning program for three shopping districts in<br />\nBaltimore and to recommend methods for the<br />\nachievement of these plans over a period of<br />\nyears. The fact that each of the three areas<br />\nsubstantially differed in a variety of<br />\ncharacteristics led to the expectation of<br />\ndifferent findings and results which would have<br />\nvalidity in other communities.<br />\n<br />\nEssential Features of the Study<br />\nThe study program contained six major<br />\nelements as follows:<br />\n<br />\n1. The Research Phase<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to the data made available from the<br />\ncommunity renewal program and other existing<br />\nstudies of the Planning Department, specific<br />\nstudies were carried out reviewing building<br />\nconditions, environmental characteristics,<br />\nattitudes and market factors.<br />\n<br />\n2. Preliminary Planning<br />\n<br />\nConsiderable attention was given to the relation<br />\nof each of the centers to its surrounding area<br />\nand to the various transportation, urban<br />\nrenewal and public facility improvement<br />\nprograms under way or proposed. These<br />\nrelationships were considered to be particularly<br />\nvital in providing the basis for an agreement on<br />\na plan with local business and resident groups<br />\nand with city agencies.<br />\n<br />\n3. Development of Planning Objectives<br />\nMeetings were held and graphic material<br />\nprepared for public discussion to establish<br />\nagreement on primary objectives of land use,<br />\ndistrict size, parking locations, circulation,<br />\ndesign elements and other elements. Agreement<br />\non objectives was considered to be a vital action<br />\nprior to any plan presentation or discussion.<br />\n<br />\n4. Concept Plans<br />\nApplying the givens outlined under the<br />\npreliminary planning stage and reflecting the<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\napproved objectives, a limited number of<br />\n<br />\nconcept plans were prepared and presented for \u00bb<br />\n<br />\ndiscussion purposes. After appropriate review<br />\nand some modification these became the basis<br />\nfor -<br />\n<br />\n5. Development Plans<br />\n<br />\nThe specific land use, circulation and design<br />\ntreatment changes were presented in a<br />\ncomprehensive fashion suitable for execution.<br />\n<br />\n6. Action Recommendations<br />\n<br />\nSpecific recommendations were made on the<br />\nutilization of ongoing programs and the<br />\nformation of additional administrative<br />\nmachinery for developing and executing the<br />\nplans.<br />\n<br />\nSummary of Accomplishments<br />\nThe primary purposes of the project were<br />\nachieved.<br />\n<br />\n1. Plan Development<br />\n<br />\nUtilizing the procedures identified above, plans<br />\nwere prepared for each center that related to a<br />\nvariety of citywide and neighborhood<br />\nconsiderations and reflected the findings of the<br />\nsurveys conducted under the study program.<br />\n<br />\n2. Plan Concurrence<br />\n<br />\nFollowing the series of steps outlined above,<br />\nthere was considerable discussion generated on<br />\nplan elements and there was general<br />\nconcurrence on plans.<br />\n<br />\n3. Plan Implementation<br />\n<br />\nSome of the recommendations of the program<br />\nhave already been initiated, particularly in the<br />\nPennsylvania Avenue Area. Considerable<br />\nfurther action is required for the full<br />\n<br />\nimplementation of the plans for the three areas.<br />\n<br />\nSummary Conclusions<br />\n<br />\n1. Design<br />\n<br />\nThe present centers are largely linear strips.<br />\nThere is a need for treatment in depth<br />\nproviding focal points, pedestrian plazas,<br />\nlinkages between building mass and open space<br />\nand better functional relations between<br />\ncirculation, parking sites and service facilities.<br />\nComprehensive improvement can only be<br />\ncarried out on this basis. The alternative is<br />\nindividual building improvement and visual<br />\nface-lifting that will have little impact on the<br />\nfunctioning of the centers,<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n2. Financial Support ,<br />\nComprehensive improvement will involve major<br />\nexpenditures. The scale of these expenditures<br />\nfor acquisition, public improvements, public<br />\nfacilities, street changes and the provision of an<br />\nadequate level of environmental amenities is<br />\nconsidered to be beyond the capability of the<br />\nlimited resources of merchants in the centers.<br />\n<br />\nPublic investment is affected by three major<br />\nconstraints.<br />\n<br />\na. In the competition for public funds, these<br />\ncenters generally have a much lower priority<br />\nrating than the central business district,<br />\nresidential neighborhoods or prime<br />\nemployment centers such as industrial districts.<br />\n<br />\nb. The expenditure of public funds for the<br />\nlimited benefit of local merchants would be<br />\nopposed by neighborhood groups with a wide<br />\nvariety of other needs.<br />\n<br />\nc. The number of shopping centers in the city<br />\ncreates a problem of priorities with reference to<br />\nthe expenditure of funds for any single center<br />\nto the exclusion of the others.<br />\n<br />\n3. Broadening the Base<br />\n<br />\nltems one and two above, Design and Financial<br />\nSupport, lead to the conclusion that a<br />\nbroadened concept of the role of local centers<br />\nwould create the basis for a more complex plan<br />\nthat dealt with an expanded center with<br />\nmultiple functions. This in turn, would make<br />\nthe center of more importance to the<br />\nneighborhood groups and to the city-at-large.<br />\nThis would then permit a greater allocation of<br />\nfunds to the improvement of the centers.<br />\n<br />\n4. Utilization of Existing Features<br />\n<br />\nThe convenience aspects of these centers, the<br />\ntransportation modes, the availability of air<br />\nrights over parking areas and one-story<br />\ncommercial uses--these and other factors<br />\nsuggest that we are presently under-utilizing our<br />\nestablished business centers.
