The \"elite\" which<br />\nrules most Latin American countries has become much more<br />\nfarsighted in recent times, he<br />\nmaintains, and \"the burden of<br />\nproof for democracy rests on<br />\nthese people\".<br />\nDr. Eisenhower pointed out<br />\nthat those who persist in comparing the expected results of<br />\nthe Alliance for Progress with<br />\nthe post-war Marshall Plan are<br />\ndue for a disappointment. With<br />\na skilled managerial pool clearly<br />\nlacking in most countries and<br />\n<br />\nwith industrial capacity severely<br />\nlimited, the foundations must be<br />\nput in place before dramatic results can be achieved.

Cleveland<br />\n<br />\nSCHOTT'S GERMAN \"SISTER\u201d<br />\n<br />\nThe Gentlemen's Express<br />\nThe Gentlemen's Code Commission has passed its<br />\nfirst obstacle and now faces its major test; it must be<br />\napproved by the student body. However, several of our<br />\ncampus legislators have apparently become too<br />\nenamoured of their newest hobby, railroading, and in<br />\ntheir enthusiasm have forgotten their basic and overriding responsibility to the student body.<br />\nThe proposed Commission can only be of use to<br />\nHopkins if it is understood and approved by the majority of students. The Student Council has no right to<br />\ntry to force this Commission upon the undergraduate.<br />\nThe SC is not entitled to insure its passage by slanting<br />\nits presentation or its meaning. If the SC should succeed in forcing the passage of this constitutional amendment, it can only serve to add an unwarranted and unpopular appendage to the already befuddled organization<br />\nof student government.<br />\nThis is not to say that the Gentlemen's Code Commission does not deserve passage by the students. It is<br />\nmerely to point out that the Student Council should<br />\ntake every possible step to insure that the students are<br />\nproperly informed as to the content of the amendment<br />\nand that they be exposed to all arguments concerning<br />\nits passage.<br />\nIt appears that Bob Abernethy and his supporters<br />\nin their desire to pass the amendment have neglected<br />\ntheir responsibility to the undergraduate. The assembly<br />\nconcerning this issue should be organized in such a<br />\nmanner that every side may be heard and questions<br />\nasked. To deny cross-questioning on the grounds that<br />\nthe proponents of the measure are insufficiently eloquent seems a poor reason. The students are entitled to<br />\na true debate of this issue in which no favoritism is<br />\nshown. Similarly, this debate should be scheduled so<br />\nthat the maximum number of students are free to attend.<br />\n<br />\nEqualify In Grading<br />\nThe institution of a point system of grading would<br />\neliminate, to a degree, certain of the inequalities and<br />\ninadequacies of the present system. That is, a 1 to<br />\n10 gradation as used at Harvard, or finer gradations of<br />\nthe present 0 to 5 system now used, would enable instructors to make their reports more accurately and<br />\nfairly.<br />\nThe current system, under which the \"plus\" and<br />\n\"minus\" portion of the grades are ignored when transcripts are prepared, makes no distinction between what<br />\ncould be very different grades. Hence, a B- grade could<br />\nbe a talked up C plus, while a B plus could be very close<br />\nto an A-. But both grades appear on the transcript as<br />\nB. Clearly, if a professor feels competent enough to<br />\nassign a grade more specific than just A, B, or C, then<br />\nthe registrar should take the trouble to recognize it.<br />\n<br />\nThe Divided Campus<br />\nWe note that the Hopkins campus has been divided<br />\ninto and East and West zone by barbed wire fencing.<br />\nAlthough this is designed to facilitate the construction<br />\nof the new Roland wing, we wonder whether formal<br />\nrights of access have yet to be fixed. In particular we<br />\nwish to know where passports may be obtained so that<br />\nvarious users of the Barn can cross the line into the<br />\nWest Sector in order to eat lunch or dinner at Levering.<br />\nPerhaps the H4U Committee could look into this<br />\nproblem.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Union Expected<br />\nUndergraduates may note with keen expectation<br />\nthat the administration has recognized the need for a<br />\nstudent union and has its construction down on the<br />\nmaster plan for sometime after 1986.<br />\n<br />\nThe Experiment is an organization which<br />\nseeks to promote a better world understanding<br />\nby sponsoring summer youth groups to nearly<br />\nfifty foreign countries. Varied in cost and duration<br />\ndependent upon the individual country, the program is broken into three basic components: a<br />\nhomestay period, a trip around the countryside<br />\nwith (\"sister\"), and a week's tour of the big city<br />\n(in Schott's case, Berlin).<br />\nFrom Schott's account of the family with<br />\nwhom he stayed and its community, it is hard to<br />\nrealize that we were at war with them less than<br />\ntwo decades ago. \"In fact,\" Schott recalled, \"the<br />\nvery first thing my 'father' did was to break out<br />\na bottle of wine and propose a<br />\ntoast to 'our friends, the Americans.'\"<br />\nUneducated But Happy<br />\n<br />\nMinority Behavior<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI want to both thank and congratulate the News-Letter on<br />\ntheir editorial \"Student Government\" which appeared in the<br />\nFebruary 9th edition.<br />\nI am considerably disturbed by<br />\nthe behavior of what I believe<br />\nto be a small minority of our<br />\nstudent body. Disregard for<br />\nother's welfare and property<br />\nseems prevalent particularly in<br />\nthe dormitory. Little or nothing<br />\nis done about it until the situation gets out-of-hand and the<br />\nDean has to become involved.<br />\nThis, I assure you, is the most<br />\nunpleasant of my duties.<br />\nI would like to see a strong<br />\nstudent government that would<br />\nmake a real effort to prevent<br />\ntrouble and keep students out<br />\nof difficulty. This can only be<br />\naccomplished by a student government (and this includes Student Council, Dormitory Student<br />\nCouncil, and Honor Commission)<br />\nin which every member takes his<br />\nobligation of office seriously<br />\nenough to be willing to do his<br />\npart to see that Hopkins men are<br />\ngentlemen both on and off the<br />\ncampus. I believe, this could be<br />\ndone with a minimum amount<br />\nof punishment involved because,<br />\n(and I repeat) the objective<br />\nwould be to prevent disorderly<br />\nconduct.<br />\nI have always believed the<br />\nNews-Letter could be a real help<br />\nto the University by sponsoring<br />\nmoves of this sort and I am<br />\nvery pleased to see this being<br />\ndone.<br />\nI will certainly await with interest your future editorials and<br />\nI would suggest you invite student participation through letters.<br />\nWilliam Kelso Morrill<br />\nDean of Students<br />\n<br />\nPig Escapade<br />\n<br />\nan inhumane manner distressed<br />\nme no end. I write to unknown<br />\nreaders who perhaps aren't there<br />\nat all, and I ask them please to<br />\nthink twice before they act again<br />\nin such a manner. Many unkind<br />\ndeeds can be avoided by one<br />\nmore thought. I ask these unknown readers to remember that<br />\nthere is nothing petty or effeminate about being kind to animals<br />\nand that animals are sensitive<br />\nin many of the same ways in<br />\nwhich human beings are sensitive. There is no doubt in my<br />\nmind that animals can feel fear<br />\nwhen in a strange situation and<br />\ncold when out in the snow. There<br />\nis also no doubt in my mind<br />\nthat, if my unknown readers are<br />\nat Johns Hopkins, if they read<br />\nthis, and if they are kind people,<br />\nthey must necessarily think a<br />\nlittle more deeply on the occasion of their next encounter<br />\nwith animals.<br />\nThank you very much.<br />\nCarroll Ehringhaus<br />\n<br />\nThe small (population 5,000);<br />\ncommunity of Tecklenburg in<br />\nWestphalia, in which Schott<br />\nlived, presents a direct contrast<br />\nto that of an American town.<br />\nSchott described the community<br />\nas composed of artists, retired<br />\nfolks, and small agricultural settlements. He expressed his shock<br />\nthat in this easy-going (but always punctual) village the people<br />\nwere \"uneducated, but happy.\"<br />\nAfter a three week \"homestay\"<br />\nperiod, the ten students who<br />\nform a regional group took their<br />\n\"sisters\" and \"brothers\" on a<br />\ntwo-week bus excursion back<br />\ninto nature. Driven by a bus<br />\ndriver named Adolphe (nicknamed der Fuhrer), the campers had the memorable experience of sleeping in old SS wine<br />\ncellars, amidst old bones, boots,<br />\nand pants.<br />\nMore Mature<br />\n<br />\nFollowing the excursion,<br />\nSchott returned to his German<br />\nfamily and rates the reception<br />\nhe got there as the most gratifyFM Difference<br />\nin_g experience in his stay. \"They<br />\nAt the present preliminary welcomed me back like one of<br />\nsteps to put WJHU-FM on the the family.

And some of you\u2014let's face it\u2014have<br />\nnot yet become BWOC's. Yes, I know, you've been busy what<br />\nwith going to class and walking your cheetah, but really, ladies,<br />\nbecoming a BWOC is so easy if you'll only follow a few simple<br />\nrules.<br />\nThe first and most basic step on the road to being a BWOC<br />\nis to attract attention. Get yourself noticed. But be very, very<br />\ncareful not to do it the wrong way. I mean, any old girl is<br />\nbound to be noticed if she goes around with a placard that says,<br />\nf\"HEY! LOOKIT ME!\" Don't you make such a horrid gaffe.<br />\nOn your placard put: \"ZUT! REGARDEZ MO!!\" This, as<br />\nyou can see, lends a whole new dimension of tone and dignity.<br />\nOnce you have been noticed, it is no longer necessary to carry<br />\nthe placard. It will suffice if, from time to time, you make<br />\ndistinctive noises. If, for instance, every three or four minutes<br />\nyou cry, \"Whippoorwill!\" you cannot but stay fresh in the<br />\nminds of onlookers.<br />\nWe come now to clothes, a vital accessory to the BWOC\u2014<br />\nindeed, to any girl who wishes to remain out of jail. But to the<br />\nBWOC clothes are more than just a decent cover; they are,<br />\nit is not too much to say, a way of life.<br />\nThis spring the \"little boy look\" is all the rage on campus.<br />\nEvery coed, in a mad effort to look like a little boy, is wearing<br />\nshort pants, knee sox, and boyshirts. But the BWOC is doing<br />\nmore. She has gone the whole bog in achieving little boyhood.<br />\nShe has frogs in her pockets, scabs on her knees, down on her<br />\nupper lip, and is followed everywhere by a dog named Spot.<br />\nAll this, of course, is only by day. When evening falls and her<br />\ndate comes calling, the BWOC is the very picture of chic femininity. She dresses in severe, simple basic black, relieved only<br />\nby a fourteen pound charm bracelet. Her hair is exquisitely<br />\ncoiffed, with a fresh rubber band around the pony tail.

Regarding the proposal that WJHU<br />\ngo on FM broadcast, however, we<br />\nfeel that the following information should be known:<br />\n1) Cost: We have estimated<br />\nthat the cost of changing over<br />\nto broadcast FM would be at<br />\nleast $10,000. This includes $4,000<br />\nfor a new transmitter, $4,000<br />\nfor new audio equipment, $1,000<br />\nfor an antenna system, and<br />\n$1,000 for other necessary equipment. Since we would have to<br />\nabide by FCC requirements far<br />\nmore stringently than in our<br />\npresent situation, the patch work<br />\nsystem presently in use would<br />\nhave to go.<br />\n2) Personnel: The FCC requires that all operating engineers hold second class commercial licenses, and that there must<br />\nbe a first class commercial engineer within telephone distance<br />\n<br />\nantees them a steady supply of<br />\nqualified engineers. WJHU can\u2014<br />\nnot guarantee such a supply.<br />\n3) Incidental notes: a) Due to<br />\ntechnical work done between<br />\nsemesters, WJHU no longer slops<br />\nits signal over 60kc. We have<br />\nnarrowed this spread to 20ke,<br />\nfrom 820 to 840 Thus, despite<br />\nthe N-L, we cannot be found at<br />\n850kc. We can, however, be<br />\nfound at our assigned frequency<br />\nof 830kc.<br />\nb) The staff of WJHU would<br />\nprefer, if it were possible to operate a broadcast station, to go<br />\non AM where we are much more<br />\nbadly needed.<br />\nC) The staff is not only tired<br />\nof hearing itself, but has memorized all the records in our collection. No doubt our listeners<br />\nhave the same complaint. We<br />\nwould appreciate a little money<br />\nto buy some new records. SAC,<br />\nplease note.<br />\nRonald J.

A. Ciccarone, Mr. Wilson<br />\nFewster, and Mr. J. A. Symonds<br />\nof the Rdmissions office. Only<br />\ntwo factors marred the contest<br />\n(1) all the judges were married<br />\nand (2) the current cheerleaders,<br />\nfrom Mt.

Yet that is exactly what has happened. And when I think about it now the reason seems<br />\nobvious. The facts and figures of banking, or of any other<br />\nfield, are mechanical devices. They take on real meaning<br />\n<br />\nonly when related to people.<br />\n\"Good psychology is also the basis of all teamwork.<br />\nAnd, since most of today's business and scientific problems are too complicated for 'one man' solutions, teamwork is essential. If you want to be a valuable team player,<br />\nand a likely candidate for captain, be the person who<br />\nunderstands people. Learn what it takes for people to<br />\nwork together in harmony. Learn how to win trust and<br />\nconfidence. Learn basic human psychology.<br />\n\"Bear this in mind, too.

The \"elite\" which<br />\nrules most Latin American countries has become much more<br />\nfarsighted in recent times, he<br />\nmaintains, and \"the burden of<br />\nproof for democracy rests on<br />\nthese people\".<br />\nDr. Eisenhower pointed out<br />\nthat those who persist in comparing the expected results of<br />\nthe Alliance for Progress with<br />\nthe post-war Marshall Plan are<br />\ndue for a disappointment. With<br />\na skilled managerial pool clearly<br />\nlacking in most countries and<br /><br />\nwith industrial capacity severely<br />\nlimited, the foundations must be<br />\nput in place before dramatic results can be achieved. He hopes<br />\nthe American public will become<br />\nmore familiar with the problems<br />\nwhich plague their neighbors to<br />\nthe south, and in the meantime<br />\nbe patient as the Alliance for<br />\nProgress penetrates Latin American society and living standards<br />\nbegin to rise at a faster rate.<br />\nTo those commentators who<br />\nwould push the Alliance for<br />\nProgress only in consonance with<br />\nthe desire to maintain some degree of American influence in<br />\nforeign policy matters, Dr. Eisenhower contends that \"in the long<br />\nrun those countries that are<br />\nviable and independent will contribute more to the Free World<br />\nand at the same time afford<br />\nthe United States the best possible security\".<br />\nThe executive machinery of<br />\nthe Alliance for Progress is<br />\ngeared to give the participating<br />\nnations an added sense of re-<br /><br />\nDr. Taylor Appointed<br />\nTo Public Health Post<br />\nThe appointment of Dr. Carl<br />\nE.

Cleveland<br /><br />\nSCHOTT'S GERMAN \"SISTER\u201d<br /><br />\nThe Gentlemen's Express<br />\nThe Gentlemen's Code Commission has passed its<br />\nfirst obstacle and now faces its major test; it must be<br />\napproved by the student body. However, several of our<br />\ncampus legislators have apparently become too<br />\nenamoured of their newest hobby, railroading, and in<br />\ntheir enthusiasm have forgotten their basic and overriding responsibility to the student body.<br />\nThe proposed Commission can only be of use to<br />\nHopkins if it is understood and approved by the majority of students. The Student Council has no right to<br />\ntry to force this Commission upon the undergraduate.<br />\nThe SC is not entitled to insure its passage by slanting<br />\nits presentation or its meaning. If the SC should succeed in forcing the passage of this constitutional amendment, it can only serve to add an unwarranted and unpopular appendage to the already befuddled organization<br />\nof student government.<br />\nThis is not to say that the Gentlemen's Code Commission does not deserve passage by the students. It is<br />\nmerely to point out that the Student Council should<br />\ntake every possible step to insure that the students are<br />\nproperly informed as to the content of the amendment<br />\nand that they be exposed to all arguments concerning<br />\nits passage.<br />\nIt appears that Bob Abernethy and his supporters<br />\nin their desire to pass the amendment have neglected<br />\ntheir responsibility to the undergraduate. The assembly<br />\nconcerning this issue should be organized in such a<br />\nmanner that every side may be heard and questions<br />\nasked. To deny cross-questioning on the grounds that<br />\nthe proponents of the measure are insufficiently eloquent seems a poor reason. The students are entitled to<br />\na true debate of this issue in which no favoritism is<br />\nshown. Similarly, this debate should be scheduled so<br />\nthat the maximum number of students are free to attend.<br /><br />\nEqualify In Grading<br />\nThe institution of a point system of grading would<br />\neliminate, to a degree, certain of the inequalities and<br />\ninadequacies of the present system. That is, a 1 to<br />\n10 gradation as used at Harvard, or finer gradations of<br />\nthe present 0 to 5 system now used, would enable instructors to make their reports more accurately and<br />\nfairly.<br />\nThe current system, under which the \"plus\" and<br />\n\"minus\" portion of the grades are ignored when transcripts are prepared, makes no distinction between what<br />\ncould be very different grades. Hence, a B- grade could<br />\nbe a talked up C plus, while a B plus could be very close<br />\nto an A-. But both grades appear on the transcript as<br />\nB. Clearly, if a professor feels competent enough to<br />\nassign a grade more specific than just A, B, or C, then<br />\nthe registrar should take the trouble to recognize it.<br /><br />\nThe Divided Campus<br />\nWe note that the Hopkins campus has been divided<br />\ninto and East and West zone by barbed wire fencing.<br />\nAlthough this is designed to facilitate the construction<br />\nof the new Roland wing, we wonder whether formal<br />\nrights of access have yet to be fixed. In particular we<br />\nwish to know where passports may be obtained so that<br />\nvarious users of the Barn can cross the line into the<br />\nWest Sector in order to eat lunch or dinner at Levering.<br />\nPerhaps the H4U Committee could look into this<br />\nproblem.<br /><br />\nStudent Union Expected<br />\nUndergraduates may note with keen expectation<br />\nthat the administration has recognized the need for a<br />\nstudent union and has its construction down on the<br />\nmaster plan for sometime after 1986.<br /><br />\nThe Experiment is an organization which<br />\nseeks to promote a better world understanding<br />\nby sponsoring summer youth groups to nearly<br />\nfifty foreign countries. Varied in cost and duration<br />\ndependent upon the individual country, the program is broken into three basic components: a<br />\nhomestay period, a trip around the countryside<br />\nwith (\"sister\"), and a week's tour of the big city<br />\n(in Schott's case, Berlin).<br />\nFrom Schott's account of the family with<br />\nwhom he stayed and its community, it is hard to<br />\nrealize that we were at war with them less than<br />\ntwo decades ago. \"In fact,\" Schott recalled, \"the<br />\nvery first thing my 'father' did was to break out<br />\na bottle of wine and propose a<br />\ntoast to 'our friends, the Americans.'\"<br />\nUneducated But Happy<br /><br />\nMinority Behavior<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI want to both thank and congratulate the News-Letter on<br />\ntheir editorial \"Student Government\" which appeared in the<br />\nFebruary 9th edition.<br />\nI am considerably disturbed by<br />\nthe behavior of what I believe<br />\nto be a small minority of our<br />\nstudent body. Disregard for<br />\nother's welfare and property<br />\nseems prevalent particularly in<br />\nthe dormitory. Little or nothing<br />\nis done about it until the situation gets out-of-hand and the<br />\nDean has to become involved.<br />\nThis, I assure you, is the most<br />\nunpleasant of my duties.<br />\nI would like to see a strong<br />\nstudent government that would<br />\nmake a real effort to prevent<br />\ntrouble and keep students out<br />\nof difficulty. This can only be<br />\naccomplished by a student government (and this includes Student Council, Dormitory Student<br />\nCouncil, and Honor Commission)<br />\nin which every member takes his<br />\nobligation of office seriously<br />\nenough to be willing to do his<br />\npart to see that Hopkins men are<br />\ngentlemen both on and off the<br />\ncampus. I believe, this could be<br />\ndone with a minimum amount<br />\nof punishment involved because,<br />\n(and I repeat) the objective<br />\nwould be to prevent disorderly<br />\nconduct.<br />\nI have always believed the<br />\nNews-Letter could be a real help<br />\nto the University by sponsoring<br />\nmoves of this sort and I am<br />\nvery pleased to see this being<br />\ndone.<br />\nI will certainly await with interest your future editorials and<br />\nI would suggest you invite student participation through letters.<br />\nWilliam Kelso Morrill<br />\nDean of Students<br /><br />\nPig Escapade<br /><br />\nan inhumane manner distressed<br />\nme no end. I write to unknown<br />\nreaders who perhaps aren't there<br />\nat all, and I ask them please to<br />\nthink twice before they act again<br />\nin such a manner. Many unkind<br />\ndeeds can be avoided by one<br />\nmore thought. I ask these unknown readers to remember that<br />\nthere is nothing petty or effeminate about being kind to animals<br />\nand that animals are sensitive<br />\nin many of the same ways in<br />\nwhich human beings are sensitive. There is no doubt in my<br />\nmind that animals can feel fear<br />\nwhen in a strange situation and<br />\ncold when out in the snow. There<br />\nis also no doubt in my mind<br />\nthat, if my unknown readers are<br />\nat Johns Hopkins, if they read<br />\nthis, and if they are kind people,<br />\nthey must necessarily think a<br />\nlittle more deeply on the occasion of their next encounter<br />\nwith animals.<br />\nThank you very much.<br />\nCarroll Ehringhaus<br /><br />\nThe small (population 5,000);<br />\ncommunity of Tecklenburg in<br />\nWestphalia, in which Schott<br />\nlived, presents a direct contrast<br />\nto that of an American town.<br />\nSchott described the community<br />\nas composed of artists, retired<br />\nfolks, and small agricultural settlements. He expressed his shock<br />\nthat in this easy-going (but always punctual) village the people<br />\nwere \"uneducated, but happy.\"<br />\nAfter a three week \"homestay\"<br />\nperiod, the ten students who<br />\nform a regional group took their<br />\n\"sisters\" and \"brothers\" on a<br />\ntwo-week bus excursion back<br />\ninto nature. Driven by a bus<br />\ndriver named Adolphe (nicknamed der Fuhrer), the campers had the memorable experience of sleeping in old SS wine<br />\ncellars, amidst old bones, boots,<br />\nand pants.<br />\nMore Mature<br /><br />\nFollowing the excursion,<br />\nSchott returned to his German<br />\nfamily and rates the reception<br />\nhe got there as the most gratifyFM Difference<br />\nin_g experience in his stay. \"They<br />\nAt the present preliminary welcomed me back like one of<br />\nsteps to put WJHU-FM on the the family.

And some of you\u2014let's face it\u2014have<br />\nnot yet become BWOC's. Yes, I know, you've been busy what<br />\nwith going to class and walking your cheetah, but really, ladies,<br />\nbecoming a BWOC is so easy if you'll only follow a few simple<br />\nrules.<br />\nThe first and most basic step on the road to being a BWOC<br />\nis to attract attention. Get yourself noticed. But be very, very<br />\ncareful not to do it the wrong way. I mean, any old girl is<br />\nbound to be noticed if she goes around with a placard that says,<br />\nf\"HEY! LOOKIT ME!\" Don't you make such a horrid gaffe.<br />\nOn your placard put: \"ZUT! REGARDEZ MO!!\" This, as<br />\nyou can see, lends a whole new dimension of tone and dignity.<br />\nOnce you have been noticed, it is no longer necessary to carry<br />\nthe placard. It will suffice if, from time to time, you make<br />\ndistinctive noises. If, for instance, every three or four minutes<br />\nyou cry, \"Whippoorwill!\" you cannot but stay fresh in the<br />\nminds of onlookers.<br />\nWe come now to clothes, a vital accessory to the BWOC\u2014<br />\nindeed, to any girl who wishes to remain out of jail. But to the<br />\nBWOC clothes are more than just a decent cover; they are,<br />\nit is not too much to say, a way of life.<br />\nThis spring the \"little boy look\" is all the rage on campus.<br />\nEvery coed, in a mad effort to look like a little boy, is wearing<br />\nshort pants, knee sox, and boyshirts. But the BWOC is doing<br />\nmore. She has gone the whole bog in achieving little boyhood.<br />\nShe has frogs in her pockets, scabs on her knees, down on her<br />\nupper lip, and is followed everywhere by a dog named Spot.<br />\nAll this, of course, is only by day. When evening falls and her<br />\ndate comes calling, the BWOC is the very picture of chic femininity. She dresses in severe, simple basic black, relieved only<br />\nby a fourteen pound charm bracelet. Her hair is exquisitely<br />\ncoiffed, with a fresh rubber band around the pony tail.

Regarding the proposal that WJHU<br />\ngo on FM broadcast, however, we<br />\nfeel that the following information should be known:<br />\n1) Cost: We have estimated<br />\nthat the cost of changing over<br />\nto broadcast FM would be at<br />\nleast $10,000. This includes $4,000<br />\nfor a new transmitter, $4,000<br />\nfor new audio equipment, $1,000<br />\nfor an antenna system, and<br />\n$1,000 for other necessary equipment. Since we would have to<br />\nabide by FCC requirements far<br />\nmore stringently than in our<br />\npresent situation, the patch work<br />\nsystem presently in use would<br />\nhave to go.<br />\n2) Personnel: The FCC requires that all operating engineers hold second class commercial licenses, and that there must<br />\nbe a first class commercial engineer within telephone distance<br /><br />\nantees them a steady supply of<br />\nqualified engineers. WJHU can\u2014<br />\nnot guarantee such a supply.<br />\n3) Incidental notes: a) Due to<br />\ntechnical work done between<br />\nsemesters, WJHU no longer slops<br />\nits signal over 60kc. We have<br />\nnarrowed this spread to 20ke,<br />\nfrom 820 to 840 Thus, despite<br />\nthe N-L, we cannot be found at<br />\n850kc. We can, however, be<br />\nfound at our assigned frequency<br />\nof 830kc.<br />\nb) The staff of WJHU would<br />\nprefer, if it were possible to operate a broadcast station, to go<br />\non AM where we are much more<br />\nbadly needed.<br />\nC) The staff is not only tired<br />\nof hearing itself, but has memorized all the records in our collection. No doubt our listeners<br />\nhave the same complaint. We<br />\nwould appreciate a little money<br />\nto buy some new records. SAC,<br />\nplease note.<br />\nRonald J.

This \"barrage\" was<br />\nled by Rick Saull, who, recovering from a miserable slump in<br />\nwhich he had scored an embarassing five points in three games,<br />\nfound the range on five of 6<br />\nfloor shots, and got 12 in the<br />\nsecond half, winding up with 18.<br />\nEncouraging also was the fine<br /><br />\nplay of Dave Leonhard, who con- break into the scoring column.<br />\nnected on 5of 7 floor shots, to Were this not enough, his floor<br />\nwind up with a total of 10 for the generalship has slipped to IS<br />\nevenings entertainment.<br />\nminimum.

Only<br />\ntwo factors marred the contest<br />\n(1) all the judges were married<br />\nand (2) the current cheerleaders,<br />\nfrom Mt. St. Agnes College, repeated as winners.<br />\nThere is no question that the<br />\nadditibn of the cheerleaders is<br />\na good thing and that they were<br />\na major factor in the fine attendance which has accompanied<br />\nthe basketball games throughout<br />\nthe year despite the team's 2-13<br />\nmark. Furthermore, the cheerleaders are a relief in themselves,<br />\ncomparing favorably with the<br />\nContours of any chemistry book<br />\nwithin reach. Hopkins fans, thus<br />\nfar disappointed in their hopes<br />\nfor a winning basketball squad,<br />\nat least have the previously unprovided consolation of attractive, pert, and attentive cheerleaders.<br /><br />\n\"Whatever your major,<br />\nmake sure to include<br />\na course in 'people'!\"<br />\nW.

They take on real meaning<br /><br />\nonly when related to people.<br />\n\"Good psychology is also the basis of all teamwork.<br />\nAnd, since most of today's business and scientific problems are too complicated for 'one man' solutions, teamwork is essential. If you want to be a valuable team player,<br />\nand a likely candidate for captain, be the person who<br />\nunderstands people. Learn what it takes for people to<br />\nwork together in harmony. Learn how to win trust and<br />\nconfidence. Learn basic human psychology.<br />\n\"Bear this in mind, too. World tension, community<br />\ntension, business tension, even family tension are the<br />\nfacts of everyday life. The more you know of human<br />\nbehavior, the better prepared you will be to deal with<br />\nthese problems.<br />\n\"So, if you have the chance, take a course devoted to<br />\n'people.' Your class adviser can probably help you fit a<br />\npsychology elective into your schedule. I don't think<br />\nyou'll regret it...I know I didn't.\" fA<br /><br />\nW.
