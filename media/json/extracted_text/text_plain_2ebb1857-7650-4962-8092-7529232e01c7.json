The \"Jay\" was naughty,<br />\nat times it approached the salacious\u2014at least that was the implication that prevailed in the public mind when the Christmas<br />\nedition was barred from the precincts of Goucher College. It<br />\nwas not fit for the fair and innocent damsels that inhabit the<br />\ndistrict below Twenty-fifth Street,\u2014at least that is what the<br />\npapers implied.<br />\nThe Business Staff of the \"Jay\" was in ecstacies ; circulation would soon be on the increase; the editors would soon<br />\nroll in the lap of luxury. The fabled good times had come with<br />\na vengeance.<br />\nAnd then Dr. Guth'broke the bubble. \"Not naughty, just a<br />\nnuisance,\" he said. He knew that the minds of the Goucher<br />\ndamsels could not be contaminated by anything as innocuous as<br />\nthe \"Jay\"; they were far beyond such a puerile stage. It was<br />\nnot naughty, it was a nuisance.<br />\nAll of which was tough luck. It was too ha<br />\n. d that Dr. Guth<br />\ncould not find fault with the content of the magazine. It was<br />\ntoo darned bad. The circulation of the dear old \"Jay\" will not<br />\nincrease so rapidly as had been expected.<br />\nIf the NEWS-LETTER may be so rash as to make a suggestion<br />\n\u2014make a snappy number, just risque enough to attract the<br />\nattention of the Comstocks, get your magazine barred from the<br />\nmails, and watch the prosperity begin to roll in. It worked<br />\nwonders at Harvard. But don't try to get the Goucher Goat.<br />\nThat college is too advanced; too liberal.<br />\n<br />\nDODGE, BRETHREN, DODGE<br />\nThrough preternatural agility the editor of this so-called<br />\npaper has just preserved his worthless life. Two unoffending<br />\nstudents who were walking with him went to a premature<br />\ngrave, crushed and mangled. And all because the walks and<br />\ndrives of Homewood were not made for the simultaneous use<br />\nof pedestrians and fast traveling automobiles.<br />\nThere is no doubt about it,\u2014the drive from the Barn to<br />\nGilman Hall should either be made wider, or sidewalks constructed. The present situation makes one's life worth little<br />\nif he dare to traverse that thoroughfare during the scholastic<br />\nrush hours. If the pedestrian is not unusually quick upon his<br />\nfeet, he stands a good chance of being used as a bumper for a<br />\ncollegiate flivver, or knocked off by a bloated plutocrat in a fur<br />\ncoat and a Packard. For the proletariat life is an unsafe and<br />\nhazardous occupation.<br />\nPlease, oh, please, Messrs. Board of 'I rustees, please give<br />\nus sidewalks.<br />\n<br />\nYES and NO<br />\nLess than a meal ago we remembered with a groan that we<br />\nwere -expected to produce a column for this issue. We felt<br />\nsunk. No time. No energy. No mood for it. Worse, nothing<br />\nto write about.<br />\n\"Oh, well,\" we sighed, getting a grip on ourself, \"we can<br />\nwrite about activities. There are other things to be sarcastic<br />\nabout besides class officers,\u2014the whole lot of activities, in fact.<br />\nFor instance, we can start with our opinion of the managerships<br />\nof sports. And, more politely, we can say what we think about<br />\nanybody who goes out for such activities.\"<br />\n\"We can go on to point out, acutely, the circular nature<br />\nof the rewards of these jobs, in showing that the assistantmanagers- crave the managerships for two reasons, exclusive of<br />\nfraternity approbation: the actual slender pleasures to be<br />\nfound in the exercise of the duties of the office, and the envy and<br />\nrespect of the campus. Then we can mention that the undergraduate respects the manager partly because of the meager<br />\nspoils of the victory, and partly because the rest of the campus<br />\nshares this respectful attitude, but chiefly because the manager<br />\nhimself feels that he has achieved something which deserves the<br />\nrespect of the campus.\"<br />\n\"In other words,\",we mused away,\"the original respectability of the activity derived from the slightly envious contemplation of the rewards, which in turn increased the joys of the<br />\npossessor. As this mutual respect became increasingly 'functionally reciprocal,' the-managerships attracted more ambitious<br />\nsouls who quite naturally accelerated the process with their<br />\negotism. Today, competition is keen for the managerships because the undergraduates have inherited the respectful attitude their predecessors assumed mainly because the managers<br />\nthemselves respected the opinion of the undergraduates.\"<br />\n\"And then,\" we continued to ourself, warming to our devilish scheme, we can paint a gruesome picture of the degrading<br />\naspects of this activity. And we can sorrowfully ponder over<br />\nits importance in the eyes of 0. D. K. Indeed, we can go on to<br />\nreveal the degradation lurking in all of the other activities.<br />\nIn each case, we can permit ourself to wonder what 0. D. K. can<br />\nsee in it. And finally, soaring swiftly to our climax, we can ask<br />\nof 0. D. K. what ft can possibly see in 0. D. K.!\"<br />\n\"If we live thru this heresy, we may even follow with a<br />\nphilosophically toleraht epilogue to the effect that activities,<br />\nafter all, are all right for those who like them. Altho, of course,<br />\nwe must confess that such people ...\"<br />\n\"But ye editor said we should be LITERARY !\", we recalled<br />\nwith a shock.<br />\n\"Oh, bologna!\", we revolted, with admirable orthography,<br />\n-we must write about something.\"<br />\n\"What do we mean\u2014'we must write about something'\", we<br />\nsavagely demanded of ourself.<br />\nWhy must we?

The \"Jay\" was naughty,<br />\nat times it approached the salacious\u2014at least that was the implication that prevailed in the public mind when the Christmas<br />\nedition was barred from the precincts of Goucher College. It<br />\nwas not fit for the fair and innocent damsels that inhabit the<br />\ndistrict below Twenty-fifth Street,\u2014at least that is what the<br />\npapers implied.<br />\nThe Business Staff of the \"Jay\" was in ecstacies ; circulation would soon be on the increase; the editors would soon<br />\nroll in the lap of luxury. The fabled good times had come with<br />\na vengeance.<br />\nAnd then Dr. Guth'broke the bubble. \"Not naughty, just a<br />\nnuisance,\" he said. He knew that the minds of the Goucher<br />\ndamsels could not be contaminated by anything as innocuous as<br />\nthe \"Jay\"; they were far beyond such a puerile stage. It was<br />\nnot naughty, it was a nuisance.<br />\nAll of which was tough luck. It was too ha<br />\n. d that Dr. Guth<br />\ncould not find fault with the content of the magazine. It was<br />\ntoo darned bad. The circulation of the dear old \"Jay\" will not<br />\nincrease so rapidly as had been expected.<br />\nIf the NEWS-LETTER may be so rash as to make a suggestion<br />\n\u2014make a snappy number, just risque enough to attract the<br />\nattention of the Comstocks, get your magazine barred from the<br />\nmails, and watch the prosperity begin to roll in.

Two unoffending<br />\nstudents who were walking with him went to a premature<br />\ngrave, crushed and mangled. And all because the walks and<br />\ndrives of Homewood were not made for the simultaneous use<br />\nof pedestrians and fast traveling automobiles.<br />\nThere is no doubt about it,\u2014the drive from the Barn to<br />\nGilman Hall should either be made wider, or sidewalks constructed. The present situation makes one's life worth little<br />\nif he dare to traverse that thoroughfare during the scholastic<br />\nrush hours. If the pedestrian is not unusually quick upon his<br />\nfeet, he stands a good chance of being used as a bumper for a<br />\ncollegiate flivver, or knocked off by a bloated plutocrat in a fur<br />\ncoat and a Packard. For the proletariat life is an unsafe and<br />\nhazardous occupation.<br />\nPlease, oh, please, Messrs. Board of 'I rustees, please give<br />\nus sidewalks.<br /><br />\nYES and NO<br />\nLess than a meal ago we remembered with a groan that we<br />\nwere -expected to produce a column for this issue. We felt<br />\nsunk. No time. No energy. No mood for it. Worse, nothing<br />\nto write about.<br />\n\"Oh, well,\" we sighed, getting a grip on ourself, \"we can<br />\nwrite about activities. There are other things to be sarcastic<br />\nabout besides class officers,\u2014the whole lot of activities, in fact.<br />\nFor instance, we can start with our opinion of the managerships<br />\nof sports. And, more politely, we can say what we think about<br />\nanybody who goes out for such activities.\"<br />\n\"We can go on to point out, acutely, the circular nature<br />\nof the rewards of these jobs, in showing that the assistantmanagers- crave the managerships for two reasons, exclusive of<br />\nfraternity approbation: the actual slender pleasures to be<br />\nfound in the exercise of the duties of the office, and the envy and<br />\nrespect of the campus. Then we can mention that the undergraduate respects the manager partly because of the meager<br />\nspoils of the victory, and partly because the rest of the campus<br />\nshares this respectful attitude, but chiefly because the manager<br />\nhimself feels that he has achieved something which deserves the<br />\nrespect of the campus.\"<br />\n\"In other words,\",we mused away,\"the original respectability of the activity derived from the slightly envious contemplation of the rewards, which in turn increased the joys of the<br />\npossessor. As this mutual respect became increasingly 'functionally reciprocal,' the-managerships attracted more ambitious<br />\nsouls who quite naturally accelerated the process with their<br />\negotism. Today, competition is keen for the managerships because the undergraduates have inherited the respectful attitude their predecessors assumed mainly because the managers<br />\nthemselves respected the opinion of the undergraduates.\"<br />\n\"And then,\" we continued to ourself, warming to our devilish scheme, we can paint a gruesome picture of the degrading<br />\naspects of this activity. And we can sorrowfully ponder over<br />\nits importance in the eyes of 0. D. K. Indeed, we can go on to<br />\nreveal the degradation lurking in all of the other activities.<br />\nIn each case, we can permit ourself to wonder what 0. D. K. can<br />\nsee in it. And finally, soaring swiftly to our climax, we can ask<br />\nof 0. D. K. what ft can possibly see in 0. D. K.!\"<br />\n\"If we live thru this heresy, we may even follow with a<br />\nphilosophically toleraht epilogue to the effect that activities,<br />\nafter all, are all right for those who like them. Altho, of course,<br />\nwe must confess that such people ...\"<br />\n\"But ye editor said we should be LITERARY !\", we recalled<br />\nwith a shock.<br />\n\"Oh, bologna!\", we revolted, with admirable orthography,<br />\n-we must write about something.\"<br />\n\"What do we mean\u2014'we must write about something'\", we<br />\nsavagely demanded of ourself.<br />\nWhy must we? Why do we<br />\nwrite the column, anyway?\"<br />\n\"Oh, it interests and amuses us. And it's good for us. Of<br />\ncourse, it would be better for us if we tackled some more ambitious type of writing.
