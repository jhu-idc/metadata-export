The<br />\nplan is being forwarded with the<br />\nYale University lately received<br />\nobject of securing for Syracuse<br />\nthe third largest bequest in the<br />\nhistory of American colleges when University not only a much-needed<br />\n$15,000,000 was left to the uni- endowment fund, but also a suitversity upon the death of John able and lasting memorial to the<br />\nW. Sterling, a Yale graduate of Syracuse men who gave their lives<br />\nin the war.<br />\nthe class of 1864.<br />\n<br />\nConnecticut College has abandoned the \"blacklist.\" Students<br />\nwill be permitted to hold office<br />\nand to participate in athletics<br />\nwithout academic restrictions, the<br />\ngood judgment and honor of each<br />\nstudent being the only test in each<br />\ncase.<br />\n<br />\nIn speaking on \"The Fundamental Conceptions in a Religion<br />\nfor the New Democracy,\" at the<br />\nopen forum last Thursday Rabbi<br />\nM. S. Lazaron emphasized the<br />\nneed of more stress on the fundamentals of religion, and the necessity of realizing that the minor<br />\ndifferences of the sects are merely<br />\nman-made. Forms and ceremonies, said the speaker, in all religions should be considered as<br />\nbut the garments in which we<br />\nwrap the sacred heritage of the<br />\nfundamentals of religion. All<br />\nshould be tolerant of any garments in which others ,wish to<br />\nwrap their own heritage, as long<br />\nas the garments themselves are<br />\nnot made the main thing. Religion has to change at this time,<br />\nwhen the whole economic and political life is changing under the<br />\ninfluence of the new spirit of<br />\nhuman brotherhood.<br />\nRabbi Lazaron believes that<br />\nthough the different denominations should lay most emphasis<br />\nupon the fundamentals, which<br />\nthey have in common; nevertheless, they should be kept distinct<br />\nin their forms and ceremonies.<br />\nThe forms and ceremonies are to<br />\nbe interpreted into their deeper<br />\nmeaning, but different forms will<br />\nappeal most strongly to people of<br />\ndifferent mental make-ups; so, for<br />\ntie benefit of the greatest number, the denominations should remain distinct from each other.<br />\nThe _economic and the industrial order are becoming democracized. So must the church<br />\nand synagogue. The place where<br />\na man sits ought not to be decided by the size of his pocketbook and church contributions,<br />\nsaid Dr. Lazaron. The pulpit<br />\nshould be open to people of all<br />\nviews\u2014it should be a forum for<br />\ntruth.<br />\nIn speaking of the needed<br />\nchanges in theology, Rabbi Lazarm), emphatically denounced the<br />\northodox division of all the<br />\nworld into the \"saved\" and the<br />\n\"damned,\" according to whether<br />\nor not they believed certain dogmas, This division comes, he<br />\nsaid, from \"a culturistic religious<br />\nphilosophy.\" No one can say that<br />\nanother will be damned, because<br />\nno religion, and no person, has<br />\nthe whole truth. Jesus of Nazareth, said the Rabbi, has been<br />\none-sidedly interpreted, and we<br />\nare in great need of a more adequate and truer interpretation of<br />\nJesus' teaching.<br />\nJesus showed in his life and in<br />\nhis teaching, Dr. Rosenau stated,<br />\nthe spirit of the older Jewish<br />\nprophets.

The<br />\nplan is being forwarded with the<br />\nYale University lately received<br />\nobject of securing for Syracuse<br />\nthe third largest bequest in the<br />\nhistory of American colleges when University not only a much-needed<br />\n$15,000,000 was left to the uni- endowment fund, but also a suitversity upon the death of John able and lasting memorial to the<br />\nW. Sterling, a Yale graduate of Syracuse men who gave their lives<br />\nin the war.<br />\nthe class of 1864.<br /><br />\nConnecticut College has abandoned the \"blacklist.\" Students<br />\nwill be permitted to hold office<br />\nand to participate in athletics<br />\nwithout academic restrictions, the<br />\ngood judgment and honor of each<br />\nstudent being the only test in each<br />\ncase.<br /><br />\nIn speaking on \"The Fundamental Conceptions in a Religion<br />\nfor the New Democracy,\" at the<br />\nopen forum last Thursday Rabbi<br />\nM. S. Lazaron emphasized the<br />\nneed of more stress on the fundamentals of religion, and the necessity of realizing that the minor<br />\ndifferences of the sects are merely<br />\nman-made. Forms and ceremonies, said the speaker, in all religions should be considered as<br />\nbut the garments in which we<br />\nwrap the sacred heritage of the<br />\nfundamentals of religion. All<br />\nshould be tolerant of any garments in which others ,wish to<br />\nwrap their own heritage, as long<br />\nas the garments themselves are<br />\nnot made the main thing. Religion has to change at this time,<br />\nwhen the whole economic and political life is changing under the<br />\ninfluence of the new spirit of<br />\nhuman brotherhood.<br />\nRabbi Lazaron believes that<br />\nthough the different denominations should lay most emphasis<br />\nupon the fundamentals, which<br />\nthey have in common; nevertheless, they should be kept distinct<br />\nin their forms and ceremonies.<br />\nThe forms and ceremonies are to<br />\nbe interpreted into their deeper<br />\nmeaning, but different forms will<br />\nappeal most strongly to people of<br />\ndifferent mental make-ups; so, for<br />\ntie benefit of the greatest number, the denominations should remain distinct from each other.<br />\nThe _economic and the industrial order are becoming democracized. So must the church<br />\nand synagogue. The place where<br />\na man sits ought not to be decided by the size of his pocketbook and church contributions,<br />\nsaid Dr. Lazaron. The pulpit<br />\nshould be open to people of all<br />\nviews\u2014it should be a forum for<br />\ntruth.<br />\nIn speaking of the needed<br />\nchanges in theology, Rabbi Lazarm), emphatically denounced the<br />\northodox division of all the<br />\nworld into the \"saved\" and the<br />\n\"damned,\" according to whether<br />\nor not they believed certain dogmas, This division comes, he<br />\nsaid, from \"a culturistic religious<br />\nphilosophy.\" No one can say that<br />\nanother will be damned, because<br />\nno religion, and no person, has<br />\nthe whole truth. Jesus of Nazareth, said the Rabbi, has been<br />\none-sidedly interpreted, and we<br />\nare in great need of a more adequate and truer interpretation of<br />\nJesus' teaching.<br />\nJesus showed in his life and in<br />\nhis teaching, Dr. Rosenau stated,<br />\nthe spirit of the older Jewish<br />\nprophets.
