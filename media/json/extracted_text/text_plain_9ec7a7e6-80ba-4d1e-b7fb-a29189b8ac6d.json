In the beginning, the<br />\nfederal government provided<br />\nwhat they considered a basic<br />\nmeal\u2014one container of milk,<br />\njuice and a bowl of cereal.

When the pupils of<br />\nSchool 53 arrive, they have a<br />\n<br />\nat breakfast<br />\n<br />\nperiod of time in which to play<br />\nvarious table games before<br />\nbreakfast. The food which is<br />\nchosen from menus is prepared<br />\nby a rotating group of five each<br />\nday.<br />\nGoode says that the purpose<br />\nof program is not only to provide<br />\na nourishing hot meal, but to<br />\nsupply a different environment as<br />\nwell.

The villain here is neither the Recommendations<br />\nCommittee, nor the quality of the institution, but rather the<br />\nenormous increase in aspiring physicians.<br />\nThough the Dean's office is in part to blame for witholding<br />\nwhat data it does have on pre-med acceptance in the past few<br />\nyears, it was the pre-meds themselves who gave in to some<br />\nuntold paranoia and began circulating horror stories. In truth,<br />\nas Dr. Martin Larrabee has pointed out, an abstract<br />\nacceptance figure should be of genuine concern to a pre-med<br />\nonly if it is zero of 100 per cent. For there is not that much<br />\nan institution can do to jeopardize or improve a med school<br />\napplicant's prospects. The acceptance percentage reflects the<br />\nresults of all applications, regardless of the academic record<br />\nof the individual. As always, the chances depend on the<br />\nindividual.<br />\nThough an open meeting to discuss the figures is in the<br />\noffing, prospective medical school applicants would do well<br />\nto avoid such a needless source of anxiety, concentrate on<br />\nthe efficacy of their own individual chances, and be wary of<br />\nstatistical bogeymen which obfuscate, rather than clarify, the<br />\nissue at hand.<br />\n<br />\nincommunicado<br />\nDr. Joseph Sampson's remarks about the undergraduate<br />\ninstructional programs in his department indicate clearly<br />\nwhere the problems lie in the teaching of the Mathematics<br />\nDepartment\u2014communication.

In fact,<br />\nthe measures already taken by the Math Department<br />\ndemonstrate that there is a willingness on the part of the<br />\nDepartment. The problem, it seems, is that the Department<br />\ndoes not fully comprehend what the problems are.<br />\nSampson reasons that because no undergraduates have<br />\ncome to hime with complaints, students must be relatively<br />\nsatisfied with the teaching in the Department. And yet,<br />\nundergraduate dissatisfaction is registered, in the Student<br />\nCouncil's Academic Reports. Moreover, it is fairly evident<br />\nthat the fundamental problems in the instructional programs<br />\nstem from the mechanics of the courses, but more<br />\nsignificantly, from the very orientation of the Department.<br />\nThe Math Department does not seem to realize, according to<br />\nthe Academic Reports at least, that the majority of students<br />\nin the introductory courses arc interested in math only in so<br />\nfar as it applies to other disciplines.<br />\nIf the Math Department is intent on improving its teaching<br />\nprograms, it would do well to heed the recommendations<br />\nmade by the Student Council which have been echoed<br />\nnumerous times before by students and faculty alike. Either<br />\nthe Math Department should make introductory required<br />\ncourses more applicable to the studies of undergraduates, or<br />\nthese courses should be taught in the Math Sciences<br />\nDepartment, a department set up for the study of applied<br />\nmathematics.<br />\nThe Math Department suffers from a condition similar to<br />\nthat of many students enrolled in the Department's intro<br />\ncourses. In both cases, it's not that there is a lack of<br />\nwillingness to learn, but that there is a difference in<br />\norientation that must be broached before communication<br />\nand learning can occur.<br />\n<br />\nNOW this is the time to strike<br />\nBy BETH KALIKOFF,<br />\nMARTHA McGLOIN,<br />\nand<br />\nPAULA TARNAPOL<br />\nThe National Organization for<br />\nWomen has designated October<br />\n29 as Women's Strike Day: a day<br />\nfor all women to halt their usual<br />\nactivity in the home, on the job,<br />\nand in bed. The purpose of this<br />\nday is to demonstrate, through<br />\nmoratorium, the impact and<br />\ncontributions of women in<br />\nsociety. Confronted with the<br />\nneed to evaluate ourselves as<br />\nindividuals and as members of a<br />\ncommunity, we recognize Strike<br />\nDay as one alterntive towards<br />\nachieving a better understanding<br />\nof our position as Hopkins<br />\nwomen. Yet, there are serious<br />\nobstacles at Hopkins to this<br />\nalternative, including the lack of<br />\nany cohesive women's movement<br />\non campus, general apathy<br />\ntowards the issue of feminine<br />\nidentity, and doubt as to the<br />\neffectiveness of such a strike on<br />\nthis campus.<br />\nStriking is not a feasible action<br />\nat Hopkins. However, ignoring<br />\nStrike Day completely would be<br />\nonly another example of women<br />\naccepting a politically passive<br />\nrole because of socialized fear of<br />\nfailure and of alienating men.<br />\nThis passivity is both implicitly<br />\nand explicitly reinforced in<br />\nfamily, school, and job<br />\nsituations. It is perpetrated by<br />\nvictimized women as well as by<br />\nmen, who benefit most from the<br />\npolitical, social, and economic<br />\npower structure as it presently<br />\nexists.<br />\nStrike Day at Hopkins,<br />\nadmittedly, will not be the<br />\nrevolutionary negation of this<br />\ningrained passivity that we so<br />\ndesperately need. But developing<br />\na unified and active feminism is a<br />\nprocess, not an event. Therefore,<br />\nthis day will provide an<br />\nopportunity for women of the<br />\ncommunity to be together and to<br />\nbegin building a collective<br />\nawareness.

Any day<br />\nwe can expect a Doonesbury<br />\ncomic that has the Vietnamese<br />\norphan reciting \"Magic Rat,<br />\nswitchblade and Asbury Park\"<br />\ninstead of his standard \"Big Mac<br />\nand creamy coleslaw.\"<br />\nComments about Springsteen<br />\nand his rise to fame fall into two<br />\ncategories, those of the Believers<br />\nand those who are not yet sure<br />\nabout the authenticity of<br />\nSoringsteen's superstar status.<br />\n<br />\nThe Believers,\u2022spearheaded by<br />\nrock journalists like Jon Landau,<br />\n(now Springsteen's producer)<br />\nwho said in April, 1974, \"I have<br />\nseen the future of rock and roll<br />\nand its name is Bruce<br />\nSpringsteen\" are convinced that<br />\nSpringsteen is a musical power of<br />\nthe same magnitude as Dylan or<br />\nElvis. As with the younger Dylan,<br />\ndewey-eyed teenagers say about<br />\nSpringsteen, \"He's so moving. He<br />\nsays all the things about growing<br />\nup that we can't. He's the<br />\nspokesman for our generation.\"<br />\nThe Believers, each of whom<br />\nthinks he discovered Springsteen,<br />\nwere probably pleased with the<br />\nsplashy coverage of their hero<br />\nalthough they would never admit<br />\nit. Most of them throw out lines<br />\nlike, \"Well, now Springsteen's<br />\nruined. The media's crushed him<br />\nand now he'll have to play large<br />\narenas and be on AM radio\"<br />\nbefore poring over copies of both<br />\nTime and Newsweek tucked<br />\naway in their pockets.<br />\nBut not everyone's sold on<br />\nSpringsteen. Some feel that<br />\nbecause the music market is dry<br />\nnow, Springsteen, the best of a<br />\nbad lot, is given extra attention.<br />\nOthers claim that Springsteen is<br />\nmerely a compilation of classic<br />\nacts from the sixties, like Dylan,<br />\nVan Morrison and the Band.<br />\nThey cite songs like \"Spirits in<br />\nthe Night,\" the lyrics of which<br />\nare suspiciously similar to those<br />\nof the Band's \"Moon-Struck<br />\nOne.\" Also, detractors crow that<br />\nSpringsteen's themes remain<br />\nunchanged after three albums. By<br />\nnow, his images of street fights<br />\nand fast cars in Jersey and New<br />\nYork City have become tiresome.<br />\nThe question then that Time<br />\nand Newsweek had to consider<br />\n<br />\nmuch as any other of the<br />\nprogramming committees. It will<br />\nplan a dance or two, hold<br />\nnretings , get input, look for<br />\nfeedback, with its ultimate aim<br />\nbeing a more viable committee.<br />\nWhy is a more viable committee<br />\ndesirable? So that it can hold<br />\nbetter dances, conduct more<br />\nmeeting, so that it will get more<br />\ninput and feedback and become<br />\neven more viable. I don't think<br />\nany one with a sound mind<br />\nwould go so far as to say that the<br />\nCommittee will do much in the<br />\nway of getting commuters<br />\nactively involved with things on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nLounge<br />\nThe Commuter Lounge is a<br />\nhorse of a different color. Nearly<br />\nall colleges with a substantial<br />\nnon-resident population have<br />\ncommuter lounges. At Goucher,<br />\nthe commuter lounge is some of<br />\nthe nicest resting space on that<br />\nspacious terrain. A commuter<br />\nlounge is important to the<br />\nnon-resident students at a school,<br />\nif only as a base of operations<br />\nfrom which they can work during<br />\nthe day.<br />\nBut the commuter lounge at<br />\nHopkins, well if people are able<br />\nto locate it, once they find it, I<br />\nthink they'll wish they hadn't. A<br />\nseasonable 65 degrees outdoors,<br />\nthe temperature in the lounge<br />\nmust have been a hellish 80 on<br />\nthe day I paid my first visit. And<br />\nwhile there is a TV,a phone, and<br />\nsome of the other I fundamental<br />\naccoutrements associated with<br />\n<br />\ncivilization, it lacks some of the<br />\nessentials for the sustenance of<br />\nhuman life, such as air. With no<br />\nwindows, the room is, to say the<br />\nleast, stuffy. It is a basically<br />\nunattractive room which, at best,<br />\nis \"unable to match the chic<br />\nmodernity of the Union's<br />\nSparkling Rathskellar,\" in the<br />\nwords of the Commuter<br />\nNewsletter. In fact, one could go<br />\nso far as to say that the Lounge is<br />\nsome of the most unpleasant<br />\nresting space on campus, the<br />\nStudent Activities office not<br />\nexcluded.<br />\nI'm not quite sure just how<br />\nmuch commuters on campus<br />\nwant to become more involved<br />\nwith campus life. But if this is<br />\ndemonstrated\u2014by the commuter<br />\ncommittee or whatever\u2014commuters deserve better than what<br />\nthey have gotten. What they have<br />\ngotten thus far is virtually<br />\nnothing. If Hopkins really wants<br />\nto do something for its<br />\ncommuters, it will have to give<br />\nthem space, not in the dorms,<br />\nwhere they have no reason to<br />\nlounge, but in Levering Hall,<br />\nwhere activities are in progress<br />\nduring the day. The changes in<br />\ncommuter life this year are a<br />\nstart, but little more than that. It<br />\nwill take more than a committee,<br />\na room,and a ride board to make<br />\ncommuting students a part of a<br />\ncampus that has never really<br />\nencouraged its commuters to<br />\nbecome involved, and which now<br />\nis barely opening up its arms to<br />\nembrace its forgotten children.<br />\n<br />\nwas this Is Springsteen just<br />\nanothe r act that Columbia<br />\nReco rd s threw their money<br />\nbehind, hoping that the glut of<br />\nadvertising and promotion would<br />\nmean instant superstar; or is he a<br />\ngenuine talent who would emerge<br />\nas a dominant cultural voice,<br />\npublicity notwithstanding.<br />\nIn any case, it is now<br />\nimmaterial whether Springsteen<br />\nis deserving of all the hype. He<br />\n<br />\nhas already been crowned<br />\nSuperstar '75. However, if<br />\nSpringsteen suddenly flops, Time<br />\nand Newsweek's credibility will<br />\nbe called into question, for it is<br />\nthese magazines, more than any<br />\nadvertising by Columbia, that<br />\nhave introduced Springsteen to<br />\nthe American public. If he fails,<br />\nit won't be easy to swallow the<br />\nnext rock sensation on the cover<br />\nof Time or Newsweek.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 6/news-letter/october 28, 1975<br />\n<br />\nStrawberry<br />\nPeach<br />\nVanilla Fudge<br />\nButter Pecan<br />\nChocolate<br />\nFrench Vanilla<br />\n<br />\nCones<br />\nSundaes<br />\n<br />\nThe Senior Class Presents<br />\n<br />\nSundaes<br />\nCones<br />\n<br />\nICE CREAM<br />\n<br />\nStrawberry<br />\nPeach<br />\nVanilla Fudge<br />\nButter Pecan<br />\nChocolate<br />\nFrench Vanilla<br />\n<br />\nUnion Lobby<br />\n9:00PM to 1:00AM<br />\nFriday October 31, Saturday November 1<br />\n<br />\nI WOMEN'S CENTER<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nEVENTS FOR<br />\nOCTOBER 29, 1975<br />\nThe M.

In the beginning, the<br />\nfederal government provided<br />\nwhat they considered a basic<br />\nmeal\u2014one container of milk,<br />\njuice and a bowl of cereal.

When the pupils of<br />\nSchool 53 arrive, they have a<br /><br />\nat breakfast<br /><br />\nperiod of time in which to play<br />\nvarious table games before<br />\nbreakfast. The food which is<br />\nchosen from menus is prepared<br />\nby a rotating group of five each<br />\nday.<br />\nGoode says that the purpose<br />\nof program is not only to provide<br />\na nourishing hot meal, but to<br />\nsupply a different environment as<br />\nwell. Because many of the<br />\nchildren's parents work, they are<br />\nleft alone most of the day.

The villain here is neither the Recommendations<br />\nCommittee, nor the quality of the institution, but rather the<br />\nenormous increase in aspiring physicians.<br />\nThough the Dean's office is in part to blame for witholding<br />\nwhat data it does have on pre-med acceptance in the past few<br />\nyears, it was the pre-meds themselves who gave in to some<br />\nuntold paranoia and began circulating horror stories. In truth,<br />\nas Dr. Martin Larrabee has pointed out, an abstract<br />\nacceptance figure should be of genuine concern to a pre-med<br />\nonly if it is zero of 100 per cent. For there is not that much<br />\nan institution can do to jeopardize or improve a med school<br />\napplicant's prospects. The acceptance percentage reflects the<br />\nresults of all applications, regardless of the academic record<br />\nof the individual. As always, the chances depend on the<br />\nindividual.<br />\nThough an open meeting to discuss the figures is in the<br />\noffing, prospective medical school applicants would do well<br />\nto avoid such a needless source of anxiety, concentrate on<br />\nthe efficacy of their own individual chances, and be wary of<br />\nstatistical bogeymen which obfuscate, rather than clarify, the<br />\nissue at hand.<br /><br />\nincommunicado<br />\nDr. Joseph Sampson's remarks about the undergraduate<br />\ninstructional programs in his department indicate clearly<br />\nwhere the problems lie in the teaching of the Mathematics<br />\nDepartment\u2014communication.

In fact,<br />\nthe measures already taken by the Math Department<br />\ndemonstrate that there is a willingness on the part of the<br />\nDepartment. The problem, it seems, is that the Department<br />\ndoes not fully comprehend what the problems are.<br />\nSampson reasons that because no undergraduates have<br />\ncome to hime with complaints, students must be relatively<br />\nsatisfied with the teaching in the Department. And yet,<br />\nundergraduate dissatisfaction is registered, in the Student<br />\nCouncil's Academic Reports. Moreover, it is fairly evident<br />\nthat the fundamental problems in the instructional programs<br />\nstem from the mechanics of the courses, but more<br />\nsignificantly, from the very orientation of the Department.<br />\nThe Math Department does not seem to realize, according to<br />\nthe Academic Reports at least, that the majority of students<br />\nin the introductory courses arc interested in math only in so<br />\nfar as it applies to other disciplines.<br />\nIf the Math Department is intent on improving its teaching<br />\nprograms, it would do well to heed the recommendations<br />\nmade by the Student Council which have been echoed<br />\nnumerous times before by students and faculty alike. Either<br />\nthe Math Department should make introductory required<br />\ncourses more applicable to the studies of undergraduates, or<br />\nthese courses should be taught in the Math Sciences<br />\nDepartment, a department set up for the study of applied<br />\nmathematics.<br />\nThe Math Department suffers from a condition similar to<br />\nthat of many students enrolled in the Department's intro<br />\ncourses. In both cases, it's not that there is a lack of<br />\nwillingness to learn, but that there is a difference in<br />\norientation that must be broached before communication<br />\nand learning can occur.<br /><br />\nNOW this is the time to strike<br />\nBy BETH KALIKOFF,<br />\nMARTHA McGLOIN,<br />\nand<br />\nPAULA TARNAPOL<br />\nThe National Organization for<br />\nWomen has designated October<br />\n29 as Women's Strike Day: a day<br />\nfor all women to halt their usual<br />\nactivity in the home, on the job,<br />\nand in bed. The purpose of this<br />\nday is to demonstrate, through<br />\nmoratorium, the impact and<br />\ncontributions of women in<br />\nsociety. Confronted with the<br />\nneed to evaluate ourselves as<br />\nindividuals and as members of a<br />\ncommunity, we recognize Strike<br />\nDay as one alterntive towards<br />\nachieving a better understanding<br />\nof our position as Hopkins<br />\nwomen. Yet, there are serious<br />\nobstacles at Hopkins to this<br />\nalternative, including the lack of<br />\nany cohesive women's movement<br />\non campus, general apathy<br />\ntowards the issue of feminine<br />\nidentity, and doubt as to the<br />\neffectiveness of such a strike on<br />\nthis campus.<br />\nStriking is not a feasible action<br />\nat Hopkins. However, ignoring<br />\nStrike Day completely would be<br />\nonly another example of women<br />\naccepting a politically passive<br />\nrole because of socialized fear of<br />\nfailure and of alienating men.<br />\nThis passivity is both implicitly<br />\nand explicitly reinforced in<br />\nfamily, school, and job<br />\nsituations. It is perpetrated by<br />\nvictimized women as well as by<br />\nmen, who benefit most from the<br />\npolitical, social, and economic<br />\npower structure as it presently<br />\nexists.<br />\nStrike Day at Hopkins,<br />\nadmittedly, will not be the<br />\nrevolutionary negation of this<br />\ningrained passivity that we so<br />\ndesperately need. But developing<br />\na unified and active feminism is a<br />\nprocess, not an event. Therefore,<br />\nthis day will provide an<br />\nopportunity for women of the<br />\ncommunity to be together and to<br />\nbegin building a collective<br />\nawareness.

Any day<br />\nwe can expect a Doonesbury<br />\ncomic that has the Vietnamese<br />\norphan reciting \"Magic Rat,<br />\nswitchblade and Asbury Park\"<br />\ninstead of his standard \"Big Mac<br />\nand creamy coleslaw.\"<br />\nComments about Springsteen<br />\nand his rise to fame fall into two<br />\ncategories, those of the Believers<br />\nand those who are not yet sure<br />\nabout the authenticity of<br />\nSoringsteen's superstar status.<br /><br />\nThe Believers,\u2022spearheaded by<br />\nrock journalists like Jon Landau,<br />\n(now Springsteen's producer)<br />\nwho said in April, 1974, \"I have<br />\nseen the future of rock and roll<br />\nand its name is Bruce<br />\nSpringsteen\" are convinced that<br />\nSpringsteen is a musical power of<br />\nthe same magnitude as Dylan or<br />\nElvis. As with the younger Dylan,<br />\ndewey-eyed teenagers say about<br />\nSpringsteen, \"He's so moving. He<br />\nsays all the things about growing<br />\nup that we can't. He's the<br />\nspokesman for our generation.\"<br />\nThe Believers, each of whom<br />\nthinks he discovered Springsteen,<br />\nwere probably pleased with the<br />\nsplashy coverage of their hero<br />\nalthough they would never admit<br />\nit. Most of them throw out lines<br />\nlike, \"Well, now Springsteen's<br />\nruined. The media's crushed him<br />\nand now he'll have to play large<br />\narenas and be on AM radio\"<br />\nbefore poring over copies of both<br />\nTime and Newsweek tucked<br />\naway in their pockets.<br />\nBut not everyone's sold on<br />\nSpringsteen. Some feel that<br />\nbecause the music market is dry<br />\nnow, Springsteen, the best of a<br />\nbad lot, is given extra attention.<br />\nOthers claim that Springsteen is<br />\nmerely a compilation of classic<br />\nacts from the sixties, like Dylan,<br />\nVan Morrison and the Band.<br />\nThey cite songs like \"Spirits in<br />\nthe Night,\" the lyrics of which<br />\nare suspiciously similar to those<br />\nof the Band's \"Moon-Struck<br />\nOne.\" Also, detractors crow that<br />\nSpringsteen's themes remain<br />\nunchanged after three albums. By<br />\nnow, his images of street fights<br />\nand fast cars in Jersey and New<br />\nYork City have become tiresome.<br />\nThe question then that Time<br />\nand Newsweek had to consider<br /><br />\nmuch as any other of the<br />\nprogramming committees. It will<br />\nplan a dance or two, hold<br />\nnretings , get input, look for<br />\nfeedback, with its ultimate aim<br />\nbeing a more viable committee.<br />\nWhy is a more viable committee<br />\ndesirable? So that it can hold<br />\nbetter dances, conduct more<br />\nmeeting, so that it will get more<br />\ninput and feedback and become<br />\neven more viable. I don't think<br />\nany one with a sound mind<br />\nwould go so far as to say that the<br />\nCommittee will do much in the<br />\nway of getting commuters<br />\nactively involved with things on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nLounge<br />\nThe Commuter Lounge is a<br />\nhorse of a different color. Nearly<br />\nall colleges with a substantial<br />\nnon-resident population have<br />\ncommuter lounges. At Goucher,<br />\nthe commuter lounge is some of<br />\nthe nicest resting space on that<br />\nspacious terrain. A commuter<br />\nlounge is important to the<br />\nnon-resident students at a school,<br />\nif only as a base of operations<br />\nfrom which they can work during<br />\nthe day.<br />\nBut the commuter lounge at<br />\nHopkins, well if people are able<br />\nto locate it, once they find it, I<br />\nthink they'll wish they hadn't. A<br />\nseasonable 65 degrees outdoors,<br />\nthe temperature in the lounge<br />\nmust have been a hellish 80 on<br />\nthe day I paid my first visit. And<br />\nwhile there is a TV,a phone, and<br />\nsome of the other I fundamental<br />\naccoutrements associated with<br /><br />\ncivilization, it lacks some of the<br />\nessentials for the sustenance of<br />\nhuman life, such as air. With no<br />\nwindows, the room is, to say the<br />\nleast, stuffy. It is a basically<br />\nunattractive room which, at best,<br />\nis \"unable to match the chic<br />\nmodernity of the Union's<br />\nSparkling Rathskellar,\" in the<br />\nwords of the Commuter<br />\nNewsletter. In fact, one could go<br />\nso far as to say that the Lounge is<br />\nsome of the most unpleasant<br />\nresting space on campus, the<br />\nStudent Activities office not<br />\nexcluded.<br />\nI'm not quite sure just how<br />\nmuch commuters on campus<br />\nwant to become more involved<br />\nwith campus life. But if this is<br />\ndemonstrated\u2014by the commuter<br />\ncommittee or whatever\u2014commuters deserve better than what<br />\nthey have gotten. What they have<br />\ngotten thus far is virtually<br />\nnothing. If Hopkins really wants<br />\nto do something for its<br />\ncommuters, it will have to give<br />\nthem space, not in the dorms,<br />\nwhere they have no reason to<br />\nlounge, but in Levering Hall,<br />\nwhere activities are in progress<br />\nduring the day. The changes in<br />\ncommuter life this year are a<br />\nstart, but little more than that. It<br />\nwill take more than a committee,<br />\na room,and a ride board to make<br />\ncommuting students a part of a<br />\ncampus that has never really<br />\nencouraged its commuters to<br />\nbecome involved, and which now<br />\nis barely opening up its arms to<br />\nembrace its forgotten children.<br /><br />\nwas this Is Springsteen just<br />\nanothe r act that Columbia<br />\nReco rd s threw their money<br />\nbehind, hoping that the glut of<br />\nadvertising and promotion would<br />\nmean instant superstar; or is he a<br />\ngenuine talent who would emerge<br />\nas a dominant cultural voice,<br />\npublicity notwithstanding.<br />\nIn any case, it is now<br />\nimmaterial whether Springsteen<br />\nis deserving of all the hype. He<br /><br />\nhas already been crowned<br />\nSuperstar '75. However, if<br />\nSpringsteen suddenly flops, Time<br />\nand Newsweek's credibility will<br />\nbe called into question, for it is<br />\nthese magazines, more than any<br />\nadvertising by Columbia, that<br />\nhave introduced Springsteen to<br />\nthe American public. If he fails,<br />\nit won't be easy to swallow the<br />\nnext rock sensation on the cover<br />\nof Time or Newsweek.<br /><br />\npage 6/news-letter/october 28, 1975<br /><br />\nStrawberry<br />\nPeach<br />\nVanilla Fudge<br />\nButter Pecan<br />\nChocolate<br />\nFrench Vanilla<br /><br />\nCones<br />\nSundaes<br /><br />\nThe Senior Class Presents<br /><br />\nSundaes<br />\nCones<br /><br />\nICE CREAM<br /><br />\nStrawberry<br />\nPeach<br />\nVanilla Fudge<br />\nButter Pecan<br />\nChocolate<br />\nFrench Vanilla<br /><br />\nUnion Lobby<br />\n9:00PM to 1:00AM<br />\nFriday October 31, Saturday November 1<br /><br />\nI WOMEN'S CENTER<br />\ni<br /><br />\nEVENTS FOR<br />\nOCTOBER 29, 1975<br />\nThe M.

Much of the contest<br />\nwas played in the Hopkins<br />\noffensive zone as Blue Jay Goalie<br />\nKen Seuess was called on to<br />\nmake only four saves during the<br />\nentire match while recording his<br />\nthird shutout of the season.<br />\nGreg Cunningham opened the<br />\nscoring for the victors midway<br />\nthrough the first half. He took a<br />\npass from winger Steve Galloway<br />\nand shot the ball past the F &amp; M<br />\nnetminder for what proved to be<br />\nthe winning goal.<br />\nThe Blue Jays struck again<br />\nseveral minutes later. Sherman<br />\nBaker picked up a loose ball<br />\nfollowing a corner kick and<br />\ndrilled it into the goal to give<br />\nHopkins a 2-0 lead at the end of<br />\none half of play.<br />\nThe Homewood booters<br />\ncontinued in the second<br />\nforty-five minutes what they had<br />\nstarted in the first half as they<br />\nproceeded to turn the game into<br />\na rout. The Diplomats could not<br />\nstop the Jays scoring thrusts<br />\nwhile being unable to mount an<br />\noffense of their own.<br />\nLarry McGowan scored the<br />\nthird JHU goal of the afternoon<br />\nearly in the half. He received a<br />\npass from Galloway and knocked<br />\nthe ball into the net.<br />\nMinutes later, Cunningham,<br />\nthe team's leading scorer with<br />\ntwelve goals, added his second of<br />\nthe game. The sophomore<br />\nforward found himself<br />\nmirabile dictu<br /><br />\nfinis<br /><br />\none-on-one with the F &amp; M<br />\nnetminder and beat his<br />\nopposition with a shot to the<br />\nright-hand corner.<br />\nReserve winger Kurt<br />\nHassenhuttl closed out the<br />\nscoring late in the contest with a<br />\nshot that eluded the leaping<br />\nDiplomat goalie, bringing the<br />\nfinal tally to 5-0.<br />\n\"This wasn't a repeat of the<br />\nGettysburg when we got a lot of<br />\ngoals and then stopped playing;<br /><br />\necond \u2022 half in which neither<br />\nteam scored.
