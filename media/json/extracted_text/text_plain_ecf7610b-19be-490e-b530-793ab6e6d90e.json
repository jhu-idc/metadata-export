Rates Reasonable.<br />\n2737 Maryland Avenue<br />\n<br />\nThe English and American poetry<br />\nof the nineteenth century was composed of two worlds: the private and<br />\nthe public. Yet, it was the private<br />\nworld that monopolized the field and<br />\nprivate experiences were given private organization to produce the<br />\npoetry of the past century. Seldom<br />\ndid the public world transgress into<br />\nthe spotlight; when it did, its form<br />\nwas that of Kipling, \"the glory of the<br />\nQueen, and never shall the sun set<br />\non the British Empire\".<br />\nBut today the two are intermixed.<br />\nNow, the political world is the public<br />\nworld, and the political world, in the<br />\nwords of Mr MacLeish, washes over<br />\nthe dykes that compose our private<br />\nlives and becomes one and the same<br />\nwith them.<br />\nYet modern poetry has not given<br />\ncomplete expression to this mixture<br />\nbecause of two reasons: the difficulty<br />\nof the labor and the reluctance of<br />\nthe poets. Before a poet can express<br />\nanything he must understand it fully;<br />\nas yet, it seems, the modern poet is<br />\nhandicapped in this quarter. If the<br />\nunderstanding is complete, then the<br />\nexperience cannot be expressed well<br />\nuntil it is forced. To express private<br />\nexperience in this manner is difficult;<br />\nto express public experience demanding a private expression and to do so<br />\nwell requires the utmost force.<br />\nPoets of today are reluctant to believe 'that these two worlds are so<br />\nwell intermixed. They say that politics do not belong in poetry nor<br />\npoetry in politics. However, we find<br />\nthat propaganda has rushed into<br />\nliterature with all the force it could<br />\nmuster. The works read by the lecturer, as Litany to Dictators by<br />\nBenet, show the forcefulness with<br />\nwhich the authors' feelings express<br />\nthe politics of the world and the inward, or private, sentiments that<br />\nthey, the politics, create.

Rates Reasonable.<br />\n2737 Maryland Avenue<br /><br />\nThe English and American poetry<br />\nof the nineteenth century was composed of two worlds: the private and<br />\nthe public. Yet, it was the private<br />\nworld that monopolized the field and<br />\nprivate experiences were given private organization to produce the<br />\npoetry of the past century. Seldom<br />\ndid the public world transgress into<br />\nthe spotlight; when it did, its form<br />\nwas that of Kipling, \"the glory of the<br />\nQueen, and never shall the sun set<br />\non the British Empire\".<br />\nBut today the two are intermixed.<br />\nNow, the political world is the public<br />\nworld, and the political world, in the<br />\nwords of Mr MacLeish, washes over<br />\nthe dykes that compose our private<br />\nlives and becomes one and the same<br />\nwith them.<br />\nYet modern poetry has not given<br />\ncomplete expression to this mixture<br />\nbecause of two reasons: the difficulty<br />\nof the labor and the reluctance of<br />\nthe poets. Before a poet can express<br />\nanything he must understand it fully;<br />\nas yet, it seems, the modern poet is<br />\nhandicapped in this quarter. If the<br />\nunderstanding is complete, then the<br />\nexperience cannot be expressed well<br />\nuntil it is forced. To express private<br />\nexperience in this manner is difficult;<br />\nto express public experience demanding a private expression and to do so<br />\nwell requires the utmost force.<br />\nPoets of today are reluctant to believe 'that these two worlds are so<br />\nwell intermixed. They say that politics do not belong in poetry nor<br />\npoetry in politics. However, we find<br />\nthat propaganda has rushed into<br />\nliterature with all the force it could<br />\nmuster. The works read by the lecturer, as Litany to Dictators by<br />\nBenet, show the forcefulness with<br />\nwhich the authors' feelings express<br />\nthe politics of the world and the inward, or private, sentiments that<br />\nthey, the politics, create. The other<br />\nmodern writers Auden, Spender,<br />\nFearing, all give evidence of the extreme combination of sentiment and<br />\nevent\u2014the new trend in poetry.<br /><br />\nWhen two charges of electricity<br />\ncome in contact, there is an explosion.<br />\nSo, when two radio poets meet, an<br />\nanalogous situation develops. Thus it<br />\nwas Monday night when Archibald<br />\nMacLeish read poetry in the presence<br />\nof Evans Rodgers (WBAL, Sunday,<br />\n10:45 a m).<br />\nOnly Mr Rodgers exploded, and this<br />\nhe did as many times as there were<br />\nstanzas in Mr Mac Leish's poems.<br />\nThe former punctuated lines from the<br />\nreader's Air Raid with violent graveyard coughs and offered sound effects<br />\nto the bombing scenes by knocking<br />\nto the floor of the Tudor and Stuart<br />\nclub several large, rare books.<br />\nHe retired into the T and S back<br />\nroom to muffle his throat disorder but<br />\nsmudged one of the Frescoes of Mr<br />\nRockefeller's City with a few broken<br />\nbeer glasses.

He believed:<br />\n\"The radio is the dictators' means<br />\nof persuading the people to accept<br />\ntheir own death\u2014spiritual, moral and<br />\noften physical.
