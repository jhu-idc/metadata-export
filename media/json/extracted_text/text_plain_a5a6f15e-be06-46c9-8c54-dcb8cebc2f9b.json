We took<br />\nissue with his statements concerning football at Hopkins in<br />\n:which he said that by de-emphasizing football and making<br />\nadmission to the games free, the game had been given back<br />\nto the students and the interest of both the school and the<br />\ncommunity was very keen in regard to the team. We concluded by saying that people seem to want a winning team.<br />\nTo back up our contention on winning teams we point to<br />\nlacrosse. I seriously question whether there would be the keen<br />\nstudent and community interest now displayed if the team<br />\nover the years was a losing proposition. Which teams do<br />\npeople fondly remember, the championship or the losing<br />\nones? Attendance estimates show that the winning teams<br />\nhave the big turnouts. We are not just pushing athletics as<br />\nsomething strictly for the spectator. It is the unusual, rather<br />\nthan the normal person, who likes to participate in a constantly losing venture.<br />\nWinning Possible<br />\n<br />\nA definition of winning is in order. We are not first of<br />\nall pushing for winning at all costs. We think that winning<br />\nis possible under present conditions with a few modifications.<br />\nThe idea of a 50 per cent winning average put forth in the<br />\neditorial last week is well taken. One point though, the period<br />\nof time should not be too long over which to average out the<br />\nwins and losses. A four year period would be, we feel, a fair<br />\ninterval of time. Thus every student at the University over<br />\na four year period-would have a chance to see \"successful\u201d<br />\nteams.<br />\nMr. Stump put forth two points in his plan for cleaning<br />\nup college athletics. One was the de-emphasizing of major<br />\nsports. The second was to promote minor sports like gynastics, badminton, golf, archery, and swimming. We are in<br />\nfavor of pushing sports other than football, basketball, lacrossee, and such. The more sports, the more opportunity for<br />\nmore students to participate. Fencing and archery appeals to<br />\nmany which are not attracted by football, basketball, or baseball. Also these sports provide the development and use of different skills.<br />\nBut it would be terrible to drop the major sports for the<br />\nminor ones. The editorial stated that if Hopkins coundn't<br />\nmeet the 50 per cent win-loss average which was set up as a<br />\nreasonable measure of success, football should be abolished.<br />\nTaking football as an example of a major sport, we feel that<br />\nit would be a great loss to a well-rounded athletic program.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nFootball Valuable<br />\n<br />\nFootball appeals to a certain segment of the student body<br />\nboth on a participation and spectator level. It also permits<br />\ncontact with a different segment of the college population of<br />\nother schools than do other sports, which gives it an educational advantage. One of the most important features of football and basketball in particular is the publicity and public<br />\nrelations value.<br />\nOne of the important problems at this school is to spread<br />\n(Continued on Page 8)<br />\n<br />\nHoping to enhance their position in the Mason-Dixon Conference chase, the Blue Jay cagers<br />\nwill meet Washington College tomorrow night at Homewood.<br />\nHopkins Coach Ross Sachs says<br />\nthat he does not know too much<br />\nabout the Shore squad since he<br />\nhas not had a chance to see them<br />\nperform this year.

However, using a zone defense<br />\nto good advantage in keeping the<br />\nJays in check, the Cardinals quickly erased this margin and held a<br />\n36-32 edge at intermission.<br />\nAfter the second half began, the<br />\nJays scored quickly, and after five<br />\nminutes went ahead, 52-42.

His<br />\nviews supported by experience in<br />\nalmost every imaginable phase of<br />\ntheatrical production, Brentano<br />\nobserves \"Opera should be just<br />\nas good theater as any theatrical<br />\nperformance. All that opera is, is<br />\ndrama with the benefit of music<br />\nwhich has proven popular through<br />\ndecades if not centuries.\"<br />\nIn this vein, Brentano evidenced<br />\ngreat interest in Hopkin.st draexplaining<br />\ndepartment,<br />\nmatic<br />\nthat he hoped that perhaps Hopkins and Peabody talent could<br />\ncombine on a production. Informed that formal drama courses<br />\nat Hopkins had been discontinued<br />\nseveral years ago, he disappointedly submitted, \"Acting has<br />\na particular boon for a person: it<br />\nteaches him to have confidence,<br />\nto project his thoughts, to know<br />\nhow to move . .. We're perhaps<br />\nputting too great a stress on science and machinery to the neglect<br />\nof the more beautiful things in<br />\nlife.\"<br />\nDespite his disappointment over<br />\nHopkins' lack of formal dramatic<br />\ninstruction (althought he insists,<br />\n\"I'm sure they (Hopkins administrators) have very good reasons<br />\nand I'm in no position to question their reasoning\"), Brentano<br />\nwaxes poetic over the facilities of<br />\nShriver Hall. The spectacled eyes<br />\ngleam as he calls it \"absolutely<br />\ndelightful,\"<br />\n<br />\nfrom the<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 6)<br />\n<br />\nits name around the country. Most males are sports fans of<br />\nsome degree. The name of the school is a list of football scores<br />\nmight be the way the name of Hopkins is brought to the attention of some people. Don't discount this. There is more<br />\nthan one case of it. Also, football serves as a showcase for<br />\nother school organizations such as the band and cheerleaders.<br />\nThe same arguments can be given for any major sport.<br />\nOur big dispute with the editorial is that \"converting the<br />\nfootball field to another soccer pitch\" would cause a serious<br />\ndeficiency in the athletic and the general program of Hopkins.<br />\nTwo Suggestions<br />\n<br />\nOur suggestion for in3proving the showing in football<br />\nare two in number. One, re-schedule the team so that it plays<br />\non a similar level of ability. We feel that the teams we face<br />\nshould have a similar set-up such as no spring practice, and<br />\nno avowed athletic scholarships.<br />\nThe second point to our program is to improve the quality of the recipients of scholarships which are given because<br />\nthe student is not only academically superior, but also a good<br />\nathlete. The same thing can be said for those students who<br />\nreceive scholarships for academic superiority plus musical,<br />\ndebating, or journalistic ability. In other words, not increasing the quantity of athletes at the expense of the other extracurricular activities, but rather raising the standards for<br />\nscholarships. To help this, we need salesmen and brushbeaters to spread the Hopkins name and attract top personnel.<br />\n<br />\nAPPLY AT<br />\nPLACEMENT BUREAU<br />\nnot later than<br />\nFEBRUARY 1st<br />\n<br />\nGridders Choose McGraw,<br />\nGallagher As Co-captains<br />\nIn a squad meeting last week,<br />\nthe varsity football team elected<br />\nDon Gallagher and Ken McGraw<br />\nas co-captains for the 1956 team.<br />\nGallagher was also co-captain of<br />\nthe 1955 squad.<br />\nVarsity Coach John Bridgers<br />\nsaid, \"We have two extremely<br />\ngood boys for co-captains.

It occurred to us that perhaps to the discerning boy, a campus paper is better advertising as a real cross<br />\nsection of collegiate life, than the brightly colored blurbs sent<br />\nout by other schools, whose newspapers, in our files, reveal<br />\nmuch the same concern, many of the same criticisms, as does<br />\n. .<br />\nours.<br />\nAnother question that disturbed us was this: the really \u2014 Correspondence \u2014<br />\ncapable boys from the New England belt are usually destined<br />\nfor Harvard and Yale at the instant of their engendering.

We took<br />\nissue with his statements concerning football at Hopkins in<br />\n:which he said that by de-emphasizing football and making<br />\nadmission to the games free, the game had been given back<br />\nto the students and the interest of both the school and the<br />\ncommunity was very keen in regard to the team. We concluded by saying that people seem to want a winning team.<br />\nTo back up our contention on winning teams we point to<br />\nlacrosse. I seriously question whether there would be the keen<br />\nstudent and community interest now displayed if the team<br />\nover the years was a losing proposition. Which teams do<br />\npeople fondly remember, the championship or the losing<br />\nones? Attendance estimates show that the winning teams<br />\nhave the big turnouts. We are not just pushing athletics as<br />\nsomething strictly for the spectator. It is the unusual, rather<br />\nthan the normal person, who likes to participate in a constantly losing venture.<br />\nWinning Possible<br /><br />\nA definition of winning is in order. We are not first of<br />\nall pushing for winning at all costs. We think that winning<br />\nis possible under present conditions with a few modifications.<br />\nThe idea of a 50 per cent winning average put forth in the<br />\neditorial last week is well taken. One point though, the period<br />\nof time should not be too long over which to average out the<br />\nwins and losses. A four year period would be, we feel, a fair<br />\ninterval of time. Thus every student at the University over<br />\na four year period-would have a chance to see \"successful\u201d<br />\nteams.<br />\nMr. Stump put forth two points in his plan for cleaning<br />\nup college athletics. One was the de-emphasizing of major<br />\nsports. The second was to promote minor sports like gynastics, badminton, golf, archery, and swimming. We are in<br />\nfavor of pushing sports other than football, basketball, lacrossee, and such. The more sports, the more opportunity for<br />\nmore students to participate. Fencing and archery appeals to<br />\nmany which are not attracted by football, basketball, or baseball. Also these sports provide the development and use of different skills.<br />\nBut it would be terrible to drop the major sports for the<br />\nminor ones. The editorial stated that if Hopkins coundn't<br />\nmeet the 50 per cent win-loss average which was set up as a<br />\nreasonable measure of success, football should be abolished.<br />\nTaking football as an example of a major sport, we feel that<br />\nit would be a great loss to a well-rounded athletic program.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nFootball Valuable<br /><br />\nFootball appeals to a certain segment of the student body<br />\nboth on a participation and spectator level. It also permits<br />\ncontact with a different segment of the college population of<br />\nother schools than do other sports, which gives it an educational advantage. One of the most important features of football and basketball in particular is the publicity and public<br />\nrelations value.<br />\nOne of the important problems at this school is to spread<br />\n(Continued on Page 8)<br /><br />\nHoping to enhance their position in the Mason-Dixon Conference chase, the Blue Jay cagers<br />\nwill meet Washington College tomorrow night at Homewood.<br />\nHopkins Coach Ross Sachs says<br />\nthat he does not know too much<br />\nabout the Shore squad since he<br />\nhas not had a chance to see them<br />\nperform this year.

His<br />\nviews supported by experience in<br />\nalmost every imaginable phase of<br />\ntheatrical production, Brentano<br />\nobserves \"Opera should be just<br />\nas good theater as any theatrical<br />\nperformance. All that opera is, is<br />\ndrama with the benefit of music<br />\nwhich has proven popular through<br />\ndecades if not centuries.\"<br />\nIn this vein, Brentano evidenced<br />\ngreat interest in Hopkin.st draexplaining<br />\ndepartment,<br />\nmatic<br />\nthat he hoped that perhaps Hopkins and Peabody talent could<br />\ncombine on a production. Informed that formal drama courses<br />\nat Hopkins had been discontinued<br />\nseveral years ago, he disappointedly submitted, \"Acting has<br />\na particular boon for a person: it<br />\nteaches him to have confidence,<br />\nto project his thoughts, to know<br />\nhow to move . .. We're perhaps<br />\nputting too great a stress on science and machinery to the neglect<br />\nof the more beautiful things in<br />\nlife.\"<br />\nDespite his disappointment over<br />\nHopkins' lack of formal dramatic<br />\ninstruction (althought he insists,<br />\n\"I'm sure they (Hopkins administrators) have very good reasons<br />\nand I'm in no position to question their reasoning\"), Brentano<br />\nwaxes poetic over the facilities of<br />\nShriver Hall. The spectacled eyes<br />\ngleam as he calls it \"absolutely<br />\ndelightful,\"<br /><br />\nfrom the<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 6)<br /><br />\nits name around the country. Most males are sports fans of<br />\nsome degree. The name of the school is a list of football scores<br />\nmight be the way the name of Hopkins is brought to the attention of some people. Don't discount this. There is more<br />\nthan one case of it. Also, football serves as a showcase for<br />\nother school organizations such as the band and cheerleaders.<br />\nThe same arguments can be given for any major sport.<br />\nOur big dispute with the editorial is that \"converting the<br />\nfootball field to another soccer pitch\" would cause a serious<br />\ndeficiency in the athletic and the general program of Hopkins.<br />\nTwo Suggestions<br /><br />\nOur suggestion for in3proving the showing in football<br />\nare two in number. One, re-schedule the team so that it plays<br />\non a similar level of ability. We feel that the teams we face<br />\nshould have a similar set-up such as no spring practice, and<br />\nno avowed athletic scholarships.<br />\nThe second point to our program is to improve the quality of the recipients of scholarships which are given because<br />\nthe student is not only academically superior, but also a good<br />\nathlete. The same thing can be said for those students who<br />\nreceive scholarships for academic superiority plus musical,<br />\ndebating, or journalistic ability. In other words, not increasing the quantity of athletes at the expense of the other extracurricular activities, but rather raising the standards for<br />\nscholarships. To help this, we need salesmen and brushbeaters to spread the Hopkins name and attract top personnel.<br /><br />\nAPPLY AT<br />\nPLACEMENT BUREAU<br />\nnot later than<br />\nFEBRUARY 1st<br /><br />\nGridders Choose McGraw,<br />\nGallagher As Co-captains<br />\nIn a squad meeting last week,<br />\nthe varsity football team elected<br />\nDon Gallagher and Ken McGraw<br />\nas co-captains for the 1956 team.<br />\nGallagher was also co-captain of<br />\nthe 1955 squad.<br />\nVarsity Coach John Bridgers<br />\nsaid, \"We have two extremely<br />\ngood boys for co-captains.
