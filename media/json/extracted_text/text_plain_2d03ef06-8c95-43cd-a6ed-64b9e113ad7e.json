The same reaction is undoubtedly produced among all<br />\npeople who must make adjustments to a new boss, but the men<br />\nin an athletic department now-a-days, feel it even more keenly<br />\nthan other university employees for obvious reasons.<br />\nLast summer a New York Herald Tribune sports columnist<br />\neame out with a statement that this Nester just couldn't forget.<br />\nThe statement said, \"Well-meaning presidents, with a disdain<br />\nfor the physical and obsessive love for the intellectual, have been<br />\nknown to go overboard for the object of their affections.\" This<br />\nput the reason for the downgrade of intercollegiate athletics in<br />\nmany colleges all in one sentence.<br />\nDE-EMPHASIS TO COLLA.PSE<br />\n<br />\nThe columnist then referred the reader to the 1940 report<br />\nof the University of Chicago. For those who didn't know, Chicago<br />\nat one time was one of the top powers in intercollegiate athletics,<br />\nbut today has weaker athletic teams than colleges even a fraction<br />\nits size in enrollment. Its basketball team plays a schedule of<br />\n\"hick\" colleges in the Illinois region and at present has the<br />\nlongest losing streak in the history of collegiate basketball in the<br />\nIT.

No wonder<br />\nathletic departments get the jitters when a new man steps in.<br />\nHowever, neither the coaches or directors of athletics at Harvard<br />\nand Hopkins have reason to get jitters. Both Dr.'s Pusey and<br />\nReed see a prominent place of athletic activity in the building of<br />\na young man into a well-rounded person.<br />\nStatements have come from both saying that their school's<br />\nathletic policy will stay as is during their stay in the head seat.<br />\nBoth presidents were athletes of sorts in college.

The same reaction is undoubtedly produced among all<br />\npeople who must make adjustments to a new boss, but the men<br />\nin an athletic department now-a-days, feel it even more keenly<br />\nthan other university employees for obvious reasons.<br />\nLast summer a New York Herald Tribune sports columnist<br />\neame out with a statement that this Nester just couldn't forget.<br />\nThe statement said, \"Well-meaning presidents, with a disdain<br />\nfor the physical and obsessive love for the intellectual, have been<br />\nknown to go overboard for the object of their affections.\" This<br />\nput the reason for the downgrade of intercollegiate athletics in<br />\nmany colleges all in one sentence.<br />\nDE-EMPHASIS TO COLLA.PSE<br /><br />\nThe columnist then referred the reader to the 1940 report<br />\nof the University of Chicago. For those who didn't know, Chicago<br />\nat one time was one of the top powers in intercollegiate athletics,<br />\nbut today has weaker athletic teams than colleges even a fraction<br />\nits size in enrollment. Its basketball team plays a schedule of<br />\n\"hick\" colleges in the Illinois region and at present has the<br />\nlongest losing streak in the history of collegiate basketball in the<br />\nIT.

No wonder<br />\nathletic departments get the jitters when a new man steps in.<br />\nHowever, neither the coaches or directors of athletics at Harvard<br />\nand Hopkins have reason to get jitters. Both Dr.'s Pusey and<br />\nReed see a prominent place of athletic activity in the building of<br />\na young man into a well-rounded person.<br />\nStatements have come from both saying that their school's<br />\nathletic policy will stay as is during their stay in the head seat.<br />\nBoth presidents were athletes of sorts in college. Hopkins' top<br />\nman played varsity tennis and even coached it after graduation<br />\n:while an instructor at Maine.<br />\nAccording to one of the recent issues of The Harvard Alumni<br />\nBulletin: \"While Mr: Pusey's undergraduate career was concentrated principally on scholarship ... he was a member of the<br />\nfreshman basketball team and in his senior year (1928), he won<br />\nthe great'Harvard-Yale-Brain Test', the one and only competition<br />\nof its kind ever held.\"<br /><br />\nVerverka and Chant have played<br />\nscarcely any defensive football.\"<br />\nAs a matter of fact. in Bridgers' words, \"We don't have a<br />\ngood defensive halfback on the<br />\nsquad.

For 'tomorrow's game the<br />\navailability of Angie Fortunato,<br />\nMickey O'Farrell, and Dick Watts<br />\nis very doubtful according to the<br />\ncoach. Also, capiain Tony Migliore suffered a dislocation of his<br />\nleft shoulder in a scrimmage on<br />\nTuesday and will not see action<br />\nfor at least three weeks if at all<br />\nthis season.

In the field of athletics it's a<br />\ndifferent story. Harvard has definitely been on the down-grade in<br />\nrecent years, while Chicago is in a hopeless situation (Chicago<br />\nbig-wigs don't even go so far as to try and find time for their<br />\nstudents to have organized basketball practices).<br />\nAs for The Hopkins, it, like Harvard, has definitely started<br />\ndown. Dr. Reed says, he strongly supports the de-emphasis program as practiced here, however to numerous students at Homewood the big-men have gone overboard lately.<br />\n.<br /><br />\nThis Nester definitely feels as though there has been an overemphasis on the program initiated by G.
