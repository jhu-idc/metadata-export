All members of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees and the<br />\nAcademic Council will have<br />\naccess to these letters and will<br />\nconsider their content in determining whether tenure should be<br />\nawarded.<br />\nThe proposal, now in the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies, must be approved by<br />\nthe Academic Council before it<br />\nbecomes University policy. The<br />\nproposal will be forwarded to<br />\nthe Academic Council when the<br />\nCUS, which is composed of four<br />\n<br />\nstudents and six professors, rule<br />\non it. CUS member and Student<br />\nCouncil president Chuck Peifer<br />\nstated that implemenation of<br />\nthis program would be the best<br />\nthing he has ever seen happen at<br />\nthis University and that he is<br />\ngoing to push strongly for its<br />\napproval. The CUS is next<br />\nscheduled to meet on March 11.<br />\nPeifer says that he will push for<br />\nbiweekly meetings of the Committee until this measure is<br />\nvoted on. He expresses optimism at its chances of gaining<br />\napproval of the Committee.<br />\nReacting after the CUS<br />\nmeeting to Mr. Fellman's proposal, Michael Hooker, Dean of<br />\nGraduate and Undergraduate<br />\nStudies, said \"I think that is<br />\nimportant and should be considered, but I am not convinced<br />\nthat the mechanism of this<br />\nproposal is right.

Bowie<br />\nlinks the University's escalating<br />\ninflation rate to the major<br />\nportions that make up the<br />\nannual Homewood budget \u2014<br />\nnamely, wages and salaries.<br />\nThroughout the 1970's,<br />\nfaculty salaries had experienced<br />\na seven percent drop in real<br />\nincome. To compensate for this<br />\nloss, most faculty salaries will be<br />\nincreased slightly higher than the<br />\n'Consumer Price Index in order<br />\nnot to fall even farther behind.<br />\nAlthough<br />\ndepartment<br />\neach<br />\ndecides its own salary system,<br />\nHopkins president Steven Muller<br />\nexplained that no salary increases<br />\nexceed ten percent next year.<br />\nThe salary increases come at<br />\na time when major corporations<br />\nand businesses are competing<br />\nwith universities for top-level<br />\nprofessors, especially in the<br />\nengineering and physical science<br />\nareas.<br />\n\u2014 In addition, drastic reductions in federal research money<br />\nhave contributed to the $850<br />\ntuition hike over the 1981-1982<br />\nfigure of $5850. One stipulation<br />\nproposed by the Reagan administration has been a ten percent<br />\ncutback on all research reimbursements sponsored by the National Institutes of Health.<br />\nPresently, all NIH-supported<br />\nresearch expenses at Hopkins are<br />\nbeing absorbed by federal<br />\nmoney. However, under the<br />\nproposed<br />\nbudget<br />\naction,<br />\nHopkins stands to lose $1.6<br />\n<br />\nmillion from this plan alone.<br />\nDecreasing<br />\ngovernment<br />\nrevenues and large cutbacks in<br />\nstudent aid have put \"extraordinary pressures on institutions like Hopkins,\" Bowie<br />\npoints out. Even with the State<br />\nof Maryland's three percent aid<br />\nincrease next year, more ways<br />\nare needed to generate funds for<br />\nstudent aid without driving up<br />\ntuition costs.<br />\nOne program<br />\nstrongly supported by the<br />\nHopkins administration is the<br />\nproposed bill in the Maryland<br />\nlegislature that would allow<br />\nJohns Hopkins to float tax-free<br />\nbonds in order to finance more<br />\nstudent loans at lower rates.<br />\nMuller hopes that \"for students<br />\nwho receive aid, the tuition<br />\nincrease will be offset by<br />\nincreases in financial aid.\"<br />\nOther items cited for the<br />\nescalating tuition costs have<br />\n<br />\nbeen an approximate 15 percent<br />\nincrease in library books, journals, and reference materials,'<br />\nand a doubling of second class<br />\npostage prices.

The topic was \"The<br />\nBudget Cuts as a Political and<br />\nMoral Situation\" and the specific question to be answered was,<br />\n\"What is the responsibility of<br />\ngovernment in weighing the need<br />\nfor economic stability against a<br />\nneed for support of social<br />\nprograms? Discuss in light of<br />\nrecent budget cuts.\" Well, I<br />\nstill don't know the answer and I<br />\ndon't think the debate changed<br />\nanyone else's mind either.<br />\nThe problem with a debate<br />\nof this type is that it is simply<br />\ntoo ambitious.<br />\nThe groups<br />\nrepresented ranged from the<br />\n<br />\nInternational Socialist Organization on the left to the Young<br />\nAmericans for Freedom on the<br />\nright. The groups are diametrically opposed; they should slug<br />\nit out \u2014 it should be great, right?<br />\nWrong. These two groups<br />\nare living in separate worlds.<br />\nAsk them to debate on the rival<br />\nbenefits of capitalism vs. socialism. Don't ask them to discuss<br />\nReagan's budget policies, because they will debate the merits<br />\nof the system in which these<br />\npolicies occur.<br />\nPerhaps the<br />\nquestion should have included<br />\nthe phrase \"given a capitalist<br />\nsystem...\"<br />\nFrom the socialists, we<br />\nheard Neil Smith who compared<br />\nsupply side economics to medieval farce theater. The theater<br />\ncont, on p. 5<br />\n<br />\nrule both students and themselves like a<br />\ntribe; this analogy was made by a tenured<br />\nprofessor in a News-Letter article last fall.<br />\nHowever, the current student government<br />\nhas pursued what is probably the most<br />\neffective means of getting a foot in the<br />\ndoor. It has consistently lobbied for a<br />\nchance for student concerns to be aired,<br />\nalbeit with no guarantees about the outcome. It has tried to expose the faculty<br />\nand the administration to its ideas as often<br />\nas possible, and it has presented these ideas<br />\ncalmly and intelligently.<br />\nPeifer and Fellman's proposals represent the most important part of the<br />\nwork they have done this year. whether oi<br />\nnot the proposals are part of a concerted<br />\neffort. To paraphrase one administrator's<br />\nprivate comment, this particular student<br />\ngovernment is strong enough this year to<br />\naccomplish many things, but time is<br />\nrunning out and accumulated steam can<br />\nblow away over the summer.<br />\nOf course, the tenure proposal comes<br />\nconspicuously close to election time. It is<br />\nof clear benefit to Fellman, who is running<br />\nfor president, whether it passes or not. Rut<br />\nthis is not an observation that is meant to<br />\nincriminate; the spirit of the proposal is<br />\ngood, and if Fellman is elected, this year's<br />\nsteam may be preserved for next year.<br />\nStudents should be aware of that when<br />\nthey vote this week.<br />\n(P.S. The News-Letter endorses Doug<br />\nFellman for Student Council president.)<br />\n<br />\nThe Education Committee<br />\nof the Student Council will soon<br />\npropose that a professor's teaching abiln:, be considered as one<br />\ncriteria in determining a professor's tenure or advancement.<br />\nWe, the undersigned students,<br />\nwholeheartedly support this proposal. If a professor's interaction with students is ignored,<br />\nand teaching is relegated a<br />\nsecondary consideration, then<br />\nthe process of learning as a<br />\nwhole can only follow suit and<br />\nsteadily degenerate. While students must not forget the fact<br />\nthat Johns Hopkins is a research<br />\ninstitution, neither can the administration cast aside the equally important fact that, in the<br />\neyes of two thousand undergraduates, Hopkins is primarily a<br />\ncenter for learning. In a time of<br />\ntuition hikes<br />\nundergraduate<br />\nabove and beyond the rate of<br />\ninflation, the administration<br />\nmust assure a comparable increase in the quality of education. The easiest and surest<br />\nmethod to accomplish such an<br />\nadvance in the quality of education is to consider student input<br />\non the effectiveness of a professor's teaching skills when determining the professor's position<br />\non campus.<br />\n<br />\nA Pressure Valve<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nI am reacting to the letter<br />\nby \"a questioning student\"<br />\nentitled, \"The Pressure Kills.<br />\n(News-Letter<br />\nFebruary<br />\n26,<br />\n1982)<br />\nI don't know where the<br />\nwriter got his information but<br />\nduring the 9 years I have been<br />\nDirector of Counseling and<br />\nPsychiatric Services on Campus<br />\nthe only reported suicide took<br />\nplace last year (this is far from<br />\nseven suicides in one year as was<br />\nsuggested in the article): Unfortunately we have indeed been<br />\ncalled after several suicide attempts.<br />\nPressure does not kill\u2014it's<br />\nhow an individual handles the<br />\npressure which can make the<br />\ndifference between a reasonably<br />\nhappy life, misery or even death.<br />\nMy staff and I are eager to assist<br />\nany student who feels that \"it's<br />\nall just too much\" or \"I am at<br />\nthe end of my rope.\" Year<br />\nround during the day we can be<br />\nreached at the White House\u2014on<br />\nevenings, weekends or holidays<br />\nby calling the Hopkins operator.<br />\nIt's everyone's responsibility<br />\nto refer to us students who are<br />\nPhilip Schmandt despondent as we have no other<br />\nMargaret Lipschutz means to reach out to them and<br />\nLaura Rosenthal try to keep them from attemptChris Campbell ing or committing a tragic and<br />\nEllen Farina final act.<br />\n\"questioning<br />\nTo<br />\nthe<br />\nCindy Stagoff<br />\nMae Thamer student\" or any student who<br />\n<br />\nwants to know more about<br />\nservices or how to handle stress<br />\nor pressure, we extend an<br />\ninvitation to talk with one of us.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nGhislaine D.

In<br />\nhis talk, Pevsner outlined the<br />\nenergy predictions of the Union<br />\nof Concerned Scientists (UCS)<br />\nand gave his own opinion on the<br />\nfuture of energy supplies in the<br />\nU.S.<br />\nAccording to the UCS,<br />\n100-300 'quads' (quadrillion<br />\nBritish Thermal Units) of energy<br />\nwill be used every year in the<br />\nU.S. between the years 2000 and<br />\n2050. According to Pevsner, oil<br />\nand gas will not meet this<br />\nEven though they<br />\ndemand.<br />\npresently meet three-quarters of<br />\nthe energy demands, reserves<br />\nwill definitely dry up within the<br />\nnext few decades.<br />\nFossil fuels, such as coal and<br />\nshale, have also been ruled out<br />\nby the UCS because they are<br />\ndangerous.<br />\nenvironmentally<br />\nMore radioactivity is emitted<br />\nfrom coal plants than nuclear<br />\nplants. Other side effects of coal<br />\nuse are land damage (strip<br />\nmining), climatic changes, melting of polar ice caps, water<br />\npollution, and oil fires. However, Pevsner noted that there is<br />\nenough coal in reserve to last for<br />\nthe next 200 years, and that<br />\nsince it is cheaper than the<br />\ntechnology needed to develop<br />\n<br />\nother sources, coal is likely to be<br />\nused.<br />\nSo, according to Pevsner<br />\nand the UCS, the three viable<br />\nsources of enercw are nuclear,<br />\nsolar, and fusion power. In<br />\nparticular, solar power is considered a very promising source,<br />\neven though it is more expensive<br />\nthan conventional sources of<br />\nenergy. Pevsner feels that at<br />\nleast 10 percent of energy needs<br />\nshould be met through solar<br />\npower. At present, there is not<br />\nenough technology for largescale use of solar energy, but if<br />\nresearch and development progresses and solar energy becomes<br />\ncheaper, then a solar economy<br />\nwill become feasible. Thousands<br />\nof quads of energy can be<br />\nproduced from nuclear sources.<br />\nFusion, which is the combination of protons to produce<br />\nhelium atoms, can release a huge<br />\namount of energy. Fission is the<br />\nopposite process. Uranium is<br />\nbroken down, and the difference<br />\nin mass is converted to energy.<br />\nBreeder reactors could produce<br />\nmillions of quads of energy\u2014enough to last for thousands<br />\nof years.<br />\nHowever, in order for any<br />\nof these potential sources to be<br />\ndeveloped, the strong economic<br />\nargument in favor of using coal<br />\nand other conventional energy<br />\nsources have to be overcome.<br />\n<br />\nDean of Academic Services Jakie Hall<br />\n<br />\nmendation in full. This proposal<br />\nwas immediately challenged by<br />\nCouncil president Chuck Peifer<br />\nwho objected to the inclusion of<br />\nother classes in the program's<br />\nfirst year. According to Peifer,<br />\nthe administration will not be<br />\nable to accurately gauge the<br />\neffectiveness of the program on<br />\nfreshmen if other classes are<br />\nincluded. Said Peifer,\"They can<br />\nonly get a true sounding if it's<br />\nonly for freshmen. They think<br />\nthere would be serious problems<br />\nif this program were implemented for all four classes.\"<br />\nPeifer's amendment was accepted by the Council 10 to 4.<br />\nColin Flynn led the opposition to the main motion to<br />\naccept the Physical Education<br />\nprogram on a voluntary basis.<br />\nSaid Flynn, \"I am just opposed<br />\nto this. If you haven't gotten<br />\nP.E. by the time you reach the<br />\nUniversity, I don't think it's the<br />\nUniversity's role to teach it. It's<br />\na waste of time.\"<br />\nmotion, however,<br />\nThe<br />\npassed Council by a vote of 13<br />\nto 3 to 2.<br />\nImmediately following the<br />\nvote, Flynn introduced another<br />\nmotion, this stating that the<br />\nCouncil opposes imposition of a<br />\nphysical education program on a<br />\nmandatory basis.

Though the list<br />\nof candidates announced included Wesley Stites, Doug Fellman<br />\nand Holly Robbins, the NewsLetter was informed late yesterday by Robbins that she has<br />\nwithdrawn from the race.<br />\nStudents running for Council office had to file petitions<br />\nwith the Elections Committee<br />\nby 5 p.m. on Tuesday. These<br />\npetitions required 100 signatures<br />\nas well as a statement by the<br />\ncandidate. The test of these<br />\nstatements is expected for relase<br />\non Monday.<br />\nRobbins, who, if elected,<br />\nwould have been the first<br />\nwoman to serve as president of<br />\nthe Council, decided not to run<br />\nwhen she learned that she had<br />\nbeen chosen for the job as<br />\nhousemaster. She said that she<br />\nfelt that she could not serve<br />\nadequately in both positions and<br />\ntherefore decided to drop her<br />\ncandidacy. Robbins termed her<br />\ndecision a very tough one, but<br />\nsaid that she felt that Doug<br />\nFellman would make an excellent president.<br />\nAsked how she felt about<br />\nleaving the race, Robbins said,\"I<br />\nfeel horrible about it, and I<br />\nfeel great about it. I had to do a<br />\nlot of thinking about which job I<br />\npreferred. But ithink I made<br />\nthe right decision. I think it's<br />\nthe best for me, and best for the<br />\n<br />\nOffice of Residential Life, and<br />\nthe best for the school. But I<br />\nhave no idea what I'm going to<br />\ndo with $16 worth of posters!\"<br />\nThe two remaining candidates, Doug Fellman, and Wesley<br />\nStites,are subjects of profiles in<br />\nthis issue of the News-Letter.<br />\nThese profiles are based on<br />\ninterviews granted to the NewsLetter by the candidates.<br />\nWES STITES<br />\nWesley Eugene Stites is the<br />\nquieter of the two candidates for<br />\nStudent Council this year. His<br />\nanme will not appear all over<br />\ncampus on posters. He will not<br />\nwalk from dorm room to dorm<br />\nroom trying to gain votes. \"My<br />\nphone number is in the Student<br />\nDirectory,\" he says. \"If people<br />\nwant to talk with me about<br />\nspecific concerns they have I<br />\nhope they will call me, or try to<br />\ntalk with me.\"<br />\nWes Stites sees two major<br />\nroles for the Council president.<br />\nFirst, he sees him as a manager,<br />\nkeeping track of and coordinating the activities of all the<br />\ncommittees. Stites spoke of his<br />\nexperience as director of the<br />\nStudent Council Film Series.<br />\n\"That has given me experience.<br />\nI have had to deal with the<br />\npeople working with me, with<br />\ndifferent companies, and with<br />\nthe administration. I think I<br />\nhave learned a lot about administrative tasks and I think we<br />\nhave been quite successful in the<br />\ntwo years I have been in charge<br />\nof the Film Series.\"<br />\nThe other role Stites sees<br />\nfor the Council president is that<br />\n<br />\nof \"chief diplomat. You have<br />\nto be able to keep communications open between the administration and the Student Council. You have to be able to<br />\nprovide informed representation<br />\n\u2014to help the student body know<br />\nwhat's going on. You have to<br />\nfind out what's bothering the<br />\nstudent body and you have to<br />\nkeep the student body informed.\"<br />\n\"I'm running for president,\"<br />\nStites continues, \"because I feel<br />\nthat I could do the job. There<br />\nare some things wrong with the<br />\nStudent Council and I fink I<br />\ncould help change them.\"<br />\nThe main problem Stites<br />\nsees with the Student Council is<br />\nthat it is currently the arbiter<br />\nof its own constitution. \"The<br />\nonly thing the students have to<br />\nprotect them from the Student<br />\nCouncil is the good will of the<br />\nCouncil members themselves. I<br />\nwould like to see a review<br />\nboard created which would be<br />\nable to determine the constitutionality of the Council's actions. The most glaring example<br />\nof Council misuse of power<br />\ncame a few years ago when<br />\nCouncil overturned the results of<br />\na student referendum. I don't<br />\nthink it should be allowed to do<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nStites thinks that the most<br />\nimportant thing the Council will<br />\nhave to do when he becomes<br />\npresident is to continue some of<br />\nthe work it has begun this year.<br />\n\"I think the Council should<br />\ncontinue much of the good work<br />\nit's done recently on many of<br />\nthe issues it has had to face, like<br />\nhousing, perhaps plus/minus<br />\n<br />\ngrading.\"<br />\nAsked what kind of president he would be, Stites said he<br />\nwill be a strict manager. \"There<br />\nis a place for informality,\" he<br />\nsays, \"but I think that in the<br />\nCouncil meetings work has to be<br />\ndone and I think that strict<br />\nrunning of meetings is the best<br />\nway to get things done.\"<br />\nAsked about the image of<br />\nthe Council, Stites fears that<br />\nstudents perceive the Council as<br />\nbeing elitist. \"I don't know how,<br />\nmuch of that is true, but if it is<br />\nperceived to be that way then<br />\nthat's all that counts. I would<br />\ntry to remove that image. I<br />\nthink I can bring a fresher<br />\noutlook to the Council that<br />\nmight help that problem.\"<br />\nDoes he think -he's the best<br />\ncandidate for the presidency?<br />\nMr. Stites seems perfectly willing<br />\nto leave that decision to the<br />\nvoters. He says he will not take<br />\nthe election personally and is<br />\nwilling to work with Council no<br />\nmatter who wins. In the mean<br />\ntime, Mr. Stites is making quiet<br />\nself-confidence the hallmark of<br />\nhis campaign.<br />\n<br />\nDOUG FELLMAN<br />\n\"The president of the Student Council,\" says Doug Fellman,\"is at the top of a pyramid.<br />\nIt is a pyramid of policy, and it<br />\nis a pyramid of management.\"<br />\nIt is Doug Fellman's belief that<br />\nin the two years he has served<br />\nthe Student Council, he has<br />\nacquired both of these skills.<br />\nLast year as a freshman,<br />\nFellman served on the Education<br />\n<br />\nPolitical Debate:<br />\nBY MIKE WASHBURN<br />\nFive college political groups<br />\nparticipated in a debate Tuesday<br />\nnight on the topic \"The Budget<br />\nCuts as a Political and Moral<br />\nSolution.\" Representatives from<br />\nthe College Republicans, International Socialist Organization,<br />\nthe Progressive Student Union,<br />\nthe Young Americans for Freedom and the Young Democrats<br />\nexpressed their views to an<br />\naudience of about seventy.<br />\nThe debate included a prepared five-minute response to<br />\nthe question, \"What is the<br />\nresponsibility of government in<br />\n<br />\nSmith, International Socialist Organization<br />\n\"The problem is not in the<br />\ndetails of what Reagain is or<br />\nisn't, the problem is in the<br />\nscript itself. . .the script has to<br />\nbe rewritten not by Reagan<br />\nhimself but by the audience<br />\nsitting here watching this very<br />\nplay he's putting on, by the<br />\nxploited, the oppressed. . .for<br />\nthem capitalism is always a<br />\nrisis.\"<br />\n<br />\nweighing the need for economic<br />\nstability against a need for<br />\nsupport of social programs?<br />\nDiscuss in light of recent budget<br />\npolicy.\" Excerpts from these<br />\nspeeches are printed below.<br />\nIn part two the groups were<br />\nallowed two minutes to answer<br />\neach of two questions formulated by the panel during the<br />\nFinally, the groups<br />\nrecess.<br />\naddressed questions from the<br />\naudience.<br />\nThe debate .was sponsored<br />\nby WJHU, the News-Letter and<br />\nZeniada.

VI.<br />\nMAY THE YEAR BRING YOU GOOD THINGS!<br />\nA discarded acquaintence of eras past<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 15<br />\n<br />\nDr Robert Tucker on Foreign Policy<br />\nthe Polish crisis. Does it mean the beginning of the end<br />\nof NATO?<br />\n<br />\nRobert Tucker, Professor of International Relations<br />\nN-L: What has been the major Foreign Policy achievement of the Reagan Administration?<br />\nTucker: I can only give what might seem to be an ironic<br />\nreply in that the major foreign policy achievement of the<br />\n,administration is outside the field of foreign policy as<br />\nsuch. Probably the most significant thing that the<br />\nReagan administration has done for foreign policy is the<br />\nposition it has taken on defense. In undertaking a large<br />\nbuild-up of American arms strategic and conventional<br />\nthe effect is going to improve on the options the Reagan<br />\nadministration will have in the ensuing years. How it<br />\nwill use those options is of course another question. But<br />\nthis is the most significant action of the administration.<br />\nOn foreign policy itself, whether one takes the Middle<br />\nEast, Europe, Africa, Central America, the administration has yet to develop policies that impress the observer.<br />\nN-L: What do you consider its major foreign policy<br />\nfailing?<br />\n<br />\nTucker: The major failing is that the administration has<br />\nyet to give a clear indication that it knows where it is<br />\ngoing and that it is settled on a scheme of priorities<br />\nindeed that it is not only settled, but it also has a fairly<br />\nviable world view and as everyone knows, this reflects<br />\nfirst the over-simple views the administration had<br />\nof foreign policy when it came to office; one must add<br />\nparenthetically reaction to the overly complex views of<br />\nthe Carter administration. Second, the relative inattention given by the President to issues of foreign policy<br />\nand third, the evident division that exists within the<br />\nadministration on American strategy in the years ahead.<br />\nN-L: What is the meaning of the Western response to<br />\n<br />\nTucker: One can hardly speak of a western response<br />\nimplying a uniform response, to the Polish crisis. There<br />\nis an American response, German response and indeed<br />\nstill a different response from the other west European<br />\nstates. The important distinction is between the American response and the German response. In principle,<br />\nthe Germans have responded to the Polish crisis by<br />\nrefusing to accept that the imposition of military rule in<br />\nPoland is an event that invalidates the premises of<br />\ndetente. Quite the contrary. They look on the prospect<br />\nof an eventual moderation in military rule as at least in<br />\npart, bearing out this promise. I see no reason to think<br />\nthat the Germans will abandon the substance of detente<br />\nbecause of events in Poland, and indeed I would be<br />\ndoubtful that they would do so even if the Russians<br />\nwere to move into Poland. The crux of the crisis between the United States and West Germany today<br />\nbrought out so clearly by events in Poland is that the<br />\nGermans have shown they are committed at least as<br />\nmuch to detente as they are to the Western Alliance and<br />\nit is that dual committment that places them on a<br />\ncollision coursewith Washington. Washington's response<br />\nto the imposition of military rule in Poland has been a<br />\nconfused one in the sense that it has yet to indicate whit<br />\nit is really after responding to the clamp-down on<br />\nSolidarity. Does it\u2014is its main intent to Use Poland as an<br />\nsanvil on which to hammer the remains of detente to<br />\npieces or is their response designed almost entirely in<br />\nterms of the attempt which acting forlorn, to force the<br />\npresent Polish government and the Russians to go back<br />\nto the situation prior to Dec. 13 last? On this larger issue<br />\nof the future of NATO,I indicate the\u2014my response to it<br />\nis in large measure contained in the earlier answer. I<br />\nthink that any disinterested observer must conclude<br />\ntoday that the future of NATO is not a very promising<br />\none. It is not a very promising one for the reason that<br />\nthe gap between the West Europeans, primarily the West<br />\nGermans, and the Americans is probably going to grow,<br />\nthat the Germans will remain, as I said, committed to<br />\ndetente, the Americans in large measure opposed to it,<br />\nand this alone will create a difficult relationship. When<br />\nyou add to that the controversies they are going to have<br />\nover theater nuclear forces, contributions for the building up of conventional forces, and of course, the question of proper strategies to follow to insure energy<br />\nsupplies in the Persian Gulf you can see little but trouble<br />\nahead. It's easy to say under no circumstances should<br />\nthe United States intervene in Central America. But of<br />\ncourse easy as that reply is, there are circumstances in<br />\nwhich we would intervene. Certainly we would do so if<br />\nit became abundantly clear that Cuban intervention and<br />\ntherefore, indirectly Russian intervention had reached a<br />\nvery high plateau. We would do so because we would<br />\nfear that the result of such intervention would be to<br />\ncreate a large and hostile military base in Central America as a result. The difficulty is that the degree of Cuban<br />\nintervention in Central American affairs today is very<br />\nuncertain. It may very well be that it is less than the<br />\ngovernment is inclined to insist. Assuming that Cuban<br />\nintervention is reasonably modest my attitude would be<br />\nthat we should not intervene, that certainly we should<br />\nnot do so to -salvage the situation in El Salvador. Nor do<br />\nthe 'prospects of attempting to fend off revolution<br />\nin Guatemala look very bright. I'm afraid that we are<br />\nrapidly reaching the point where it will probably be<br />\nincumbent to attempt to draw a line somewhere<br />\n<br />\nfurther, perhaps Costa Rica and simply adjust to the<br />\neventual loss of El Salvador and very likely Guatemala.<br />\nCertainly I would be prepared to do so under the condition that the Cubans and the Russians have no more<br />\nthan a marginal influence on the outcome of events in<br />\nthese two countries.<br />\nN-L: Do you still hold the same view on the role of the<br />\nU.S. in the Persian Gulf?<br />\nTucker: On the role that the United States should play<br />\nin the Persian Gulf, I see no reason to change the view<br />\nthat I have had for some years now. The United States<br />\nhas little alternative but to play a dominant role in the<br />\naffairs of the Gulf in order to attempt to insure the<br />\nsecurity of oil supplies. These supplies are indispensible<br />\nto both Western Europe and Japan. If they were suddenly interrupted whether by events indigenous to the<br />\nGulf or by an outside force the entire structure of the<br />\nAmerican- position in the world would be jeopardized.<br />\nThe issue, then, is not whether we must play a leading<br />\nrole in the Persian Gulf but how we should do so.<br />\nThis administration as its predecessor, is committed to a<br />\nrole that seeks to secure American interests in the Gulf<br />\nby reliance on the indigenous powers of the region. In<br />\nplace of Iran, the Reagan administration substituted<br />\nSaudi Arabia. There's a classic case of history repeating<br />\nitself, only this time it's farce. If the present administration's policy of relying upon the Saudi surrogate works<br />\nit will only be as a result of sheer luck. The desirable<br />\npolicy would, of course, be for this copntry to introduce<br />\nits power into the region of the Gulf and to do so<br />\nas rapidly as possible. This is not a policy that seems at<br />\nall imminent today. The Saudi emphasis of the Reagan<br />\nadministration is the -ultimate reason for the poor<br />\nrelations between this administration and the Israelis.<br />\nThe great committment to the Saudis creates a number<br />\nof implications, almost all of which are negative, for the<br />\nWashington-Jerusalem relationship. I do not see any<br />\nway how American relations with Israel can be improved<br />\nso long as the present emphasis on the centrality of the<br />\nSaudis persists and indeed, I see every reason for assuming that the Washington-Jerusalem ties will further erode<br />\nas a conseuqence of administration policy.<br />\nN-L: What is the probability of a Palestinian settlement<br />\nin the Mid East?<br />\nTucker: On the probability of a Palestinian settlement<br />\nin the Middle East, I think the prospects for a settlement<br />\nare very low today. The Israelis have very little incentive<br />\nto push the Palestinian issue. The military balance is<br />\nsuch that it constitutes no incentive for the Israelis.<br />\nAmerican policy is such that it is almost a disincentive to<br />\nthe Israelis. On the other hand, the Arabs themselves<br />\nhave little reason to push for a settlement. Clearly, the<br />\nEgyptians can only find a role in this matter a political<br />\nliability and will probably attempt to detach themselves<br />\nfurther once the Sinai is returned to them in late April.<br />\nOn the other hand, the Saudis having suffered some<br />\ndegree of humiliation from their Arab friends in putting<br />\nforth their peace initiative of last fall , will be extremely<br />\nreluctant to put forth any new initiative. Besides, the<br />\nvery weakness of the Saudi position is such that they<br />\ncannot afford to go beyond beyond a very modest point<br />\nin their proposals. I think what we are in for now is a<br />\nfairly substantial period in which, despite Western<br />\npressures, both European and American, you will see<br />\nboth Arab and Israeli positions rather tight.<br />\n<br />\nThe United States in the Middle East<br />\n<br />\n(cont. from p. 13)<br />\nment of anything resembling a Palestinian state. Mubarak, seeking to regain credibility and a leadership role<br />\nin the Arab world, cannot settle for less. Most likely,<br />\nIsrael and Egypt will go their separate ways after Egypt<br />\ngets the rest of the Sinai back on April 26. Said Haig<br />\nrecently, \"Egypt will go back to the Arab world, with<br />\nthe U.S. isolated as Israel's sole defender. Egypt's<br />\nposition under Mubarak is 180 percent different than it<br />\nhad been with Sadat.\"<br />\nAs for the administration's policy of a \"strategic<br />\nconsensus,\" the fact that the Israelis and the Arabs still<br />\nconsider each other, not the Soviets, the greatest threat<br />\nto peace, has doomed it to failure. The Arab-Israeli<br />\nconflict is especially painful for the United States<br />\nbecause of apparent mutually exclusive interests. Global<br />\nstrategic interests dictate that the U.S. establish closer<br />\nties with the Arab states\u2014especially Saudi Arabia--yet<br />\ncurrently, this is only possible by loosening ties with<br />\nIsrael, our closest friend and longtime ally in the region.<br />\nThis perception of a fundamental conflict of interests is<br />\n<br />\nprincipally responsible for the steady deterioration of<br />\nthe Israeli-American relationship. Neither has the Begin<br />\ngovernment helped much in this regard. Reagan twice<br />\nhad to delay the delivery of planes to Israel because<br />\nof the bombings of the Iraqi nuclear power plant and the<br />\nPLO bases in Beirut, and he was later forced to cancel<br />\nthe security cooperation pact because of the Israeli<br />\nannexation of the Golan Heights. Problems also arose<br />\nover which countries were to send troops to the buffer<br />\nzone between Israel and Egypt in the Sinai. Especially<br />\nworrying to the U.S. today is the possibility of an<br />\nIsraeli invasion into southern Lebanon to remove the<br />\nthreat of PLO forces there. An invasion could easily<br />\nprecipitate another Mid-East and even lead to a superpower confrontation.<br />\nAs a consequence of the current failure of<br />\nlong-range political strategy, U.S. foreign policy in the<br />\nMid-East consists primarily of the sale of arms. Here,<br />\nReagan has had some success. After a difficult fight he<br />\npushed the AWACs arms package through the Senate,<br />\nand joint maneuvers with Egyptian forces effectively<br />\n<br />\ndisplayed U.S. muscle. Also, the administration is trying<br />\nto convince Jordan to buy American rather than Soviet<br />\narms.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Administration can point to<br />\nfew tangible gains from this policy of weapon sales.<br />\nSaudi Arabia, for example, has refused to give any<br />\nassurances about the use of the AWACs that might<br />\nplacate Israel and Hussein has given no indication that he<br />\nwill cancel the order for Soviet ground-to-air missiles,<br />\neven if the United States provides him with similar<br />\nweapons.<br />\nOverall, Reagan has had only fair success at best<br />\nwith his program. The Palestinian autonomy talks<br />\nappear permanently stalled, no strategic consensus on<br />\nthe Soviet threat can be reached, and relations with<br />\nIsrael have been strained. The Administration had one<br />\nshining success. when Philip Habib, the U.S. envoy,<br />\ndefused the Syrian anti-aircraft missile crisis and arranged for a cease-fire in Lebanon. However, this was in<br />\nreaction to events and not part of the President's policy.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 16/ MARCH 5,198<br />\n.mm)ma<br />\n<br />\n.,)mmdavo)fff.).=\u2022)\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nasohme.bm.hmtb..)...4m.<br />\n<br />\n1 \" PINE BROOK CHINESE RESTAURANT<br />\n<br />\nIMMIGRATION<br />\nPROBLEMS<br />\n<br />\nNorthern & Szechtern Style Cuisine<br />\n1011 W.360% Street<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland<br />\n<br />\n467-2499<br />\n<br />\nWhy spend so much money for a meal at<br />\nthe other restaurants?

Though<br />\nI would have been happier if P.J. Soles<br />\nhad put in an appearance, kudos must<br />\ngo to the Student Council for providing<br />\nwhat Larry Lippin introduced as \"the first<br />\nreal concert at Hopkins...ever.\"<br />\nShriver contained a near capacity<br />\ncrowd for the show, which began at<br />\nabout 8:25 with a Baltimore warm-up<br />\nband, Null Set. Embodying some kind of<br />\nnihilistic, conceptually-obnoxious philosophy (the band wore only black), Null<br />\nSet, its lead singer resembling both Gary<br />\nNuman and Herman Munster, played a<br />\nloud and strident set concerned with<br />\n(what'else?) alienation and the decline of<br />\nsociety. The volume level revealed the<br />\nacoustic limitations of Shriver, for<br />\nanyone who had any misconceptions.<br />\nNot many of the audience were inspired<br />\nto dance, aside from several devoteescum-plants, who took to the aisles right<br />\naway (all wearing black).<br />\n***<br />\nPop punk. What a gas. Weekend<br />\npunks and concert-thirsty heathens. . .a<br />\nrowdy get-together with the Ramones<br />\nand warm-up band Null Set.

All members of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees and the<br />\nAcademic Council will have<br />\naccess to these letters and will<br />\nconsider their content in determining whether tenure should be<br />\nawarded.<br />\nThe proposal, now in the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies, must be approved by<br />\nthe Academic Council before it<br />\nbecomes University policy. The<br />\nproposal will be forwarded to<br />\nthe Academic Council when the<br />\nCUS, which is composed of four<br /><br />\nstudents and six professors, rule<br />\non it. CUS member and Student<br />\nCouncil president Chuck Peifer<br />\nstated that implemenation of<br />\nthis program would be the best<br />\nthing he has ever seen happen at<br />\nthis University and that he is<br />\ngoing to push strongly for its<br />\napproval. The CUS is next<br />\nscheduled to meet on March 11.<br />\nPeifer says that he will push for<br />\nbiweekly meetings of the Committee until this measure is<br />\nvoted on. He expresses optimism at its chances of gaining<br />\napproval of the Committee.<br />\nReacting after the CUS<br />\nmeeting to Mr. Fellman's proposal, Michael Hooker, Dean of<br />\nGraduate and Undergraduate<br />\nStudies, said \"I think that is<br />\nimportant and should be considered, but I am not convinced<br />\nthat the mechanism of this<br />\nproposal is right. I think the<br />\nproposal would tend to become<br />\na little unwieldy. I don't know<br />\nhow that many letters could be<br />\ncollected in time, how they<br />\nwould be filed, how they would<br />\nbe distributed.

The topic was \"The<br />\nBudget Cuts as a Political and<br />\nMoral Situation\" and the specific question to be answered was,<br />\n\"What is the responsibility of<br />\ngovernment in weighing the need<br />\nfor economic stability against a<br />\nneed for support of social<br />\nprograms? Discuss in light of<br />\nrecent budget cuts.\" Well, I<br />\nstill don't know the answer and I<br />\ndon't think the debate changed<br />\nanyone else's mind either.<br />\nThe problem with a debate<br />\nof this type is that it is simply<br />\ntoo ambitious.<br />\nThe groups<br />\nrepresented ranged from the<br /><br />\nInternational Socialist Organization on the left to the Young<br />\nAmericans for Freedom on the<br />\nright.

It has consistently lobbied for a<br />\nchance for student concerns to be aired,<br />\nalbeit with no guarantees about the outcome. It has tried to expose the faculty<br />\nand the administration to its ideas as often<br />\nas possible, and it has presented these ideas<br />\ncalmly and intelligently.<br />\nPeifer and Fellman's proposals represent the most important part of the<br />\nwork they have done this year. whether oi<br />\nnot the proposals are part of a concerted<br />\neffort. To paraphrase one administrator's<br />\nprivate comment, this particular student<br />\ngovernment is strong enough this year to<br />\naccomplish many things, but time is<br />\nrunning out and accumulated steam can<br />\nblow away over the summer.<br />\nOf course, the tenure proposal comes<br />\nconspicuously close to election time. It is<br />\nof clear benefit to Fellman, who is running<br />\nfor president, whether it passes or not. Rut<br />\nthis is not an observation that is meant to<br />\nincriminate; the spirit of the proposal is<br />\ngood, and if Fellman is elected, this year's<br />\nsteam may be preserved for next year.<br />\nStudents should be aware of that when<br />\nthey vote this week.<br />\n(P.S.

If a professor's interaction with students is ignored,<br />\nand teaching is relegated a<br />\nsecondary consideration, then<br />\nthe process of learning as a<br />\nwhole can only follow suit and<br />\nsteadily degenerate. While students must not forget the fact<br />\nthat Johns Hopkins is a research<br />\ninstitution, neither can the administration cast aside the equally important fact that, in the<br />\neyes of two thousand undergraduates, Hopkins is primarily a<br />\ncenter for learning.

In<br />\nhis talk, Pevsner outlined the<br />\nenergy predictions of the Union<br />\nof Concerned Scientists (UCS)<br />\nand gave his own opinion on the<br />\nfuture of energy supplies in the<br />\nU.S.<br />\nAccording to the UCS,<br />\n100-300 'quads' (quadrillion<br />\nBritish Thermal Units) of energy<br />\nwill be used every year in the<br />\nU.S. between the years 2000 and<br />\n2050. According to Pevsner, oil<br />\nand gas will not meet this<br />\nEven though they<br />\ndemand.<br />\npresently meet three-quarters of<br />\nthe energy demands, reserves<br />\nwill definitely dry up within the<br />\nnext few decades.<br />\nFossil fuels, such as coal and<br />\nshale, have also been ruled out<br />\nby the UCS because they are<br />\ndangerous.<br />\nenvironmentally<br />\nMore radioactivity is emitted<br />\nfrom coal plants than nuclear<br />\nplants. Other side effects of coal<br />\nuse are land damage (strip<br />\nmining), climatic changes, melting of polar ice caps, water<br />\npollution, and oil fires. However, Pevsner noted that there is<br />\nenough coal in reserve to last for<br />\nthe next 200 years, and that<br />\nsince it is cheaper than the<br />\ntechnology needed to develop<br /><br />\nother sources, coal is likely to be<br />\nused.<br />\nSo, according to Pevsner<br />\nand the UCS, the three viable<br />\nsources of enercw are nuclear,<br />\nsolar, and fusion power. In<br />\nparticular, solar power is considered a very promising source,<br />\neven though it is more expensive<br />\nthan conventional sources of<br />\nenergy. Pevsner feels that at<br />\nleast 10 percent of energy needs<br />\nshould be met through solar<br />\npower. At present, there is not<br />\nenough technology for largescale use of solar energy, but if<br />\nresearch and development progresses and solar energy becomes<br />\ncheaper, then a solar economy<br />\nwill become feasible. Thousands<br />\nof quads of energy can be<br />\nproduced from nuclear sources.<br />\nFusion, which is the combination of protons to produce<br />\nhelium atoms, can release a huge<br />\namount of energy. Fission is the<br />\nopposite process. Uranium is<br />\nbroken down, and the difference<br />\nin mass is converted to energy.<br />\nBreeder reactors could produce<br />\nmillions of quads of energy\u2014enough to last for thousands<br />\nof years.<br />\nHowever, in order for any<br />\nof these potential sources to be<br />\ndeveloped, the strong economic<br />\nargument in favor of using coal<br />\nand other conventional energy<br />\nsources have to be overcome.<br /><br />\nDean of Academic Services Jakie Hall<br /><br />\nmendation in full. This proposal<br />\nwas immediately challenged by<br />\nCouncil president Chuck Peifer<br />\nwho objected to the inclusion of<br />\nother classes in the program's<br />\nfirst year. According to Peifer,<br />\nthe administration will not be<br />\nable to accurately gauge the<br />\neffectiveness of the program on<br />\nfreshmen if other classes are<br />\nincluded. Said Peifer,\"They can<br />\nonly get a true sounding if it's<br />\nonly for freshmen. They think<br />\nthere would be serious problems<br />\nif this program were implemented for all four classes.\"<br />\nPeifer's amendment was accepted by the Council 10 to 4.<br />\nColin Flynn led the opposition to the main motion to<br />\naccept the Physical Education<br />\nprogram on a voluntary basis.<br />\nSaid Flynn, \"I am just opposed<br />\nto this. If you haven't gotten<br />\nP.E. by the time you reach the<br />\nUniversity, I don't think it's the<br />\nUniversity's role to teach it.

Though the list<br />\nof candidates announced included Wesley Stites, Doug Fellman<br />\nand Holly Robbins, the NewsLetter was informed late yesterday by Robbins that she has<br />\nwithdrawn from the race.<br />\nStudents running for Council office had to file petitions<br />\nwith the Elections Committee<br />\nby 5 p.m. on Tuesday. These<br />\npetitions required 100 signatures<br />\nas well as a statement by the<br />\ncandidate. The test of these<br />\nstatements is expected for relase<br />\non Monday.<br />\nRobbins, who, if elected,<br />\nwould have been the first<br />\nwoman to serve as president of<br />\nthe Council, decided not to run<br />\nwhen she learned that she had<br />\nbeen chosen for the job as<br />\nhousemaster. She said that she<br />\nfelt that she could not serve<br />\nadequately in both positions and<br />\ntherefore decided to drop her<br />\ncandidacy. Robbins termed her<br />\ndecision a very tough one, but<br />\nsaid that she felt that Doug<br />\nFellman would make an excellent president.<br />\nAsked how she felt about<br />\nleaving the race, Robbins said,\"I<br />\nfeel horrible about it, and I<br />\nfeel great about it. I had to do a<br />\nlot of thinking about which job I<br />\npreferred. But ithink I made<br />\nthe right decision. I think it's<br />\nthe best for me, and best for the<br /><br />\nOffice of Residential Life, and<br />\nthe best for the school. But I<br />\nhave no idea what I'm going to<br />\ndo with $16 worth of posters!\"<br />\nThe two remaining candidates, Doug Fellman, and Wesley<br />\nStites,are subjects of profiles in<br />\nthis issue of the News-Letter.<br />\nThese profiles are based on<br />\ninterviews granted to the NewsLetter by the candidates.<br />\nWES STITES<br />\nWesley Eugene Stites is the<br />\nquieter of the two candidates for<br />\nStudent Council this year.

He will not<br />\nwalk from dorm room to dorm<br />\nroom trying to gain votes. \"My<br />\nphone number is in the Student<br />\nDirectory,\" he says. \"If people<br />\nwant to talk with me about<br />\nspecific concerns they have I<br />\nhope they will call me, or try to<br />\ntalk with me.\"<br />\nWes Stites sees two major<br />\nroles for the Council president.<br />\nFirst, he sees him as a manager,<br />\nkeeping track of and coordinating the activities of all the<br />\ncommittees. Stites spoke of his<br />\nexperience as director of the<br />\nStudent Council Film Series.<br />\n\"That has given me experience.<br />\nI have had to deal with the<br />\npeople working with me, with<br />\ndifferent companies, and with<br />\nthe administration. I think I<br />\nhave learned a lot about administrative tasks and I think we<br />\nhave been quite successful in the<br />\ntwo years I have been in charge<br />\nof the Film Series.\"<br />\nThe other role Stites sees<br />\nfor the Council president is that<br /><br />\nof \"chief diplomat. You have<br />\nto be able to keep communications open between the administration and the Student Council. You have to be able to<br />\nprovide informed representation<br />\n\u2014to help the student body know<br />\nwhat's going on. You have to<br />\nfind out what's bothering the<br />\nstudent body and you have to<br />\nkeep the student body informed.\"<br />\n\"I'm running for president,\"<br />\nStites continues, \"because I feel<br />\nthat I could do the job. There<br />\nare some things wrong with the<br />\nStudent Council and I fink I<br />\ncould help change them.\"<br />\nThe main problem Stites<br />\nsees with the Student Council is<br />\nthat it is currently the arbiter<br />\nof its own constitution. \"The<br />\nonly thing the students have to<br />\nprotect them from the Student<br />\nCouncil is the good will of the<br />\nCouncil members themselves. I<br />\nwould like to see a review<br />\nboard created which would be<br />\nable to determine the constitutionality of the Council's actions. The most glaring example<br />\nof Council misuse of power<br />\ncame a few years ago when<br />\nCouncil overturned the results of<br />\na student referendum. I don't<br />\nthink it should be allowed to do<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nStites thinks that the most<br />\nimportant thing the Council will<br />\nhave to do when he becomes<br />\npresident is to continue some of<br />\nthe work it has begun this year.<br />\n\"I think the Council should<br />\ncontinue much of the good work<br />\nit's done recently on many of<br />\nthe issues it has had to face, like<br />\nhousing, perhaps plus/minus<br /><br />\ngrading.\"<br />\nAsked what kind of president he would be, Stites said he<br />\nwill be a strict manager. \"There<br />\nis a place for informality,\" he<br />\nsays, \"but I think that in the<br />\nCouncil meetings work has to be<br />\ndone and I think that strict<br />\nrunning of meetings is the best<br />\nway to get things done.\"<br />\nAsked about the image of<br />\nthe Council, Stites fears that<br />\nstudents perceive the Council as<br />\nbeing elitist. \"I don't know how,<br />\nmuch of that is true, but if it is<br />\nperceived to be that way then<br />\nthat's all that counts. I would<br />\ntry to remove that image. I<br />\nthink I can bring a fresher<br />\noutlook to the Council that<br />\nmight help that problem.\"<br />\nDoes he think -he's the best<br />\ncandidate for the presidency?<br />\nMr. Stites seems perfectly willing<br />\nto leave that decision to the<br />\nvoters. He says he will not take<br />\nthe election personally and is<br />\nwilling to work with Council no<br />\nmatter who wins. In the mean<br />\ntime, Mr. Stites is making quiet<br />\nself-confidence the hallmark of<br />\nhis campaign.<br /><br />\nDOUG FELLMAN<br />\n\"The president of the Student Council,\" says Doug Fellman,\"is at the top of a pyramid.<br />\nIt is a pyramid of policy, and it<br />\nis a pyramid of management.\"<br />\nIt is Doug Fellman's belief that<br />\nin the two years he has served<br />\nthe Student Council, he has<br />\nacquired both of these skills.<br />\nLast year as a freshman,<br />\nFellman served on the Education<br /><br />\nPolitical Debate:<br />\nBY MIKE WASHBURN<br />\nFive college political groups<br />\nparticipated in a debate Tuesday<br />\nnight on the topic \"The Budget<br />\nCuts as a Political and Moral<br />\nSolution.\" Representatives from<br />\nthe College Republicans, International Socialist Organization,<br />\nthe Progressive Student Union,<br />\nthe Young Americans for Freedom and the Young Democrats<br />\nexpressed their views to an<br />\naudience of about seventy.<br />\nThe debate included a prepared five-minute response to<br />\nthe question, \"What is the<br />\nresponsibility of government in<br /><br />\nSmith, International Socialist Organization<br />\n\"The problem is not in the<br />\ndetails of what Reagain is or<br />\nisn't, the problem is in the<br />\nscript itself. . .the script has to<br />\nbe rewritten not by Reagan<br />\nhimself but by the audience<br />\nsitting here watching this very<br />\nplay he's putting on, by the<br />\nxploited, the oppressed. . .for<br />\nthem capitalism is always a<br />\nrisis.\"<br /><br />\nweighing the need for economic<br />\nstability against a need for<br />\nsupport of social programs?<br />\nDiscuss in light of recent budget<br />\npolicy.\" Excerpts from these<br />\nspeeches are printed below.<br />\nIn part two the groups were<br />\nallowed two minutes to answer<br />\neach of two questions formulated by the panel during the<br />\nFinally, the groups<br />\nrecess.<br />\naddressed questions from the<br />\naudience.<br />\nThe debate .was sponsored<br />\nby WJHU, the News-Letter and<br />\nZeniada.

VI.<br />\nMAY THE YEAR BRING YOU GOOD THINGS!<br />\nA discarded acquaintence of eras past<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 15<br /><br />\nDr Robert Tucker on Foreign Policy<br />\nthe Polish crisis. Does it mean the beginning of the end<br />\nof NATO?<br /><br />\nRobert Tucker, Professor of International Relations<br />\nN-L: What has been the major Foreign Policy achievement of the Reagan Administration?<br />\nTucker: I can only give what might seem to be an ironic<br />\nreply in that the major foreign policy achievement of the<br />\n,administration is outside the field of foreign policy as<br />\nsuch. Probably the most significant thing that the<br />\nReagan administration has done for foreign policy is the<br />\nposition it has taken on defense. In undertaking a large<br />\nbuild-up of American arms strategic and conventional<br />\nthe effect is going to improve on the options the Reagan<br />\nadministration will have in the ensuing years. How it<br />\nwill use those options is of course another question. But<br />\nthis is the most significant action of the administration.<br />\nOn foreign policy itself, whether one takes the Middle<br />\nEast, Europe, Africa, Central America, the administration has yet to develop policies that impress the observer.<br />\nN-L: What do you consider its major foreign policy<br />\nfailing?<br /><br />\nTucker: The major failing is that the administration has<br />\nyet to give a clear indication that it knows where it is<br />\ngoing and that it is settled on a scheme of priorities<br />\nindeed that it is not only settled, but it also has a fairly<br />\nviable world view and as everyone knows, this reflects<br />\nfirst the over-simple views the administration had<br />\nof foreign policy when it came to office; one must add<br />\nparenthetically reaction to the overly complex views of<br />\nthe Carter administration. Second, the relative inattention given by the President to issues of foreign policy<br />\nand third, the evident division that exists within the<br />\nadministration on American strategy in the years ahead.<br />\nN-L: What is the meaning of the Western response to<br /><br />\nTucker: One can hardly speak of a western response<br />\nimplying a uniform response, to the Polish crisis. There<br />\nis an American response, German response and indeed<br />\nstill a different response from the other west European<br />\nstates. The important distinction is between the American response and the German response. In principle,<br />\nthe Germans have responded to the Polish crisis by<br />\nrefusing to accept that the imposition of military rule in<br />\nPoland is an event that invalidates the premises of<br />\ndetente. Quite the contrary. They look on the prospect<br />\nof an eventual moderation in military rule as at least in<br />\npart, bearing out this promise. I see no reason to think<br />\nthat the Germans will abandon the substance of detente<br />\nbecause of events in Poland, and indeed I would be<br />\ndoubtful that they would do so even if the Russians<br />\nwere to move into Poland. The crux of the crisis between the United States and West Germany today<br />\nbrought out so clearly by events in Poland is that the<br />\nGermans have shown they are committed at least as<br />\nmuch to detente as they are to the Western Alliance and<br />\nit is that dual committment that places them on a<br />\ncollision coursewith Washington. Washington's response<br />\nto the imposition of military rule in Poland has been a<br />\nconfused one in the sense that it has yet to indicate whit<br />\nit is really after responding to the clamp-down on<br />\nSolidarity. Does it\u2014is its main intent to Use Poland as an<br />\nsanvil on which to hammer the remains of detente to<br />\npieces or is their response designed almost entirely in<br />\nterms of the attempt which acting forlorn, to force the<br />\npresent Polish government and the Russians to go back<br />\nto the situation prior to Dec. 13 last? On this larger issue<br />\nof the future of NATO,I indicate the\u2014my response to it<br />\nis in large measure contained in the earlier answer. I<br />\nthink that any disinterested observer must conclude<br />\ntoday that the future of NATO is not a very promising<br />\none. It is not a very promising one for the reason that<br />\nthe gap between the West Europeans, primarily the West<br />\nGermans, and the Americans is probably going to grow,<br />\nthat the Germans will remain, as I said, committed to<br />\ndetente, the Americans in large measure opposed to it,<br />\nand this alone will create a difficult relationship. When<br />\nyou add to that the controversies they are going to have<br />\nover theater nuclear forces, contributions for the building up of conventional forces, and of course, the question of proper strategies to follow to insure energy<br />\nsupplies in the Persian Gulf you can see little but trouble<br />\nahead. It's easy to say under no circumstances should<br />\nthe United States intervene in Central America. But of<br />\ncourse easy as that reply is, there are circumstances in<br />\nwhich we would intervene. Certainly we would do so if<br />\nit became abundantly clear that Cuban intervention and<br />\ntherefore, indirectly Russian intervention had reached a<br />\nvery high plateau. We would do so because we would<br />\nfear that the result of such intervention would be to<br />\ncreate a large and hostile military base in Central America as a result. The difficulty is that the degree of Cuban<br />\nintervention in Central American affairs today is very<br />\nuncertain. It may very well be that it is less than the<br />\ngovernment is inclined to insist. Assuming that Cuban<br />\nintervention is reasonably modest my attitude would be<br />\nthat we should not intervene, that certainly we should<br />\nnot do so to -salvage the situation in El Salvador. Nor do<br />\nthe 'prospects of attempting to fend off revolution<br />\nin Guatemala look very bright. I'm afraid that we are<br />\nrapidly reaching the point where it will probably be<br />\nincumbent to attempt to draw a line somewhere<br /><br />\nfurther, perhaps Costa Rica and simply adjust to the<br />\neventual loss of El Salvador and very likely Guatemala.<br />\nCertainly I would be prepared to do so under the condition that the Cubans and the Russians have no more<br />\nthan a marginal influence on the outcome of events in<br />\nthese two countries.<br />\nN-L: Do you still hold the same view on the role of the<br />\nU.S. in the Persian Gulf?<br />\nTucker: On the role that the United States should play<br />\nin the Persian Gulf, I see no reason to change the view<br />\nthat I have had for some years now. The United States<br />\nhas little alternative but to play a dominant role in the<br />\naffairs of the Gulf in order to attempt to insure the<br />\nsecurity of oil supplies. These supplies are indispensible<br />\nto both Western Europe and Japan. If they were suddenly interrupted whether by events indigenous to the<br />\nGulf or by an outside force the entire structure of the<br />\nAmerican- position in the world would be jeopardized.<br />\nThe issue, then, is not whether we must play a leading<br />\nrole in the Persian Gulf but how we should do so.<br />\nThis administration as its predecessor, is committed to a<br />\nrole that seeks to secure American interests in the Gulf<br />\nby reliance on the indigenous powers of the region. In<br />\nplace of Iran, the Reagan administration substituted<br />\nSaudi Arabia. There's a classic case of history repeating<br />\nitself, only this time it's farce. If the present administration's policy of relying upon the Saudi surrogate works<br />\nit will only be as a result of sheer luck. The desirable<br />\npolicy would, of course, be for this copntry to introduce<br />\nits power into the region of the Gulf and to do so<br />\nas rapidly as possible. This is not a policy that seems at<br />\nall imminent today. The Saudi emphasis of the Reagan<br />\nadministration is the -ultimate reason for the poor<br />\nrelations between this administration and the Israelis.<br />\nThe great committment to the Saudis creates a number<br />\nof implications, almost all of which are negative, for the<br />\nWashington-Jerusalem relationship. I do not see any<br />\nway how American relations with Israel can be improved<br />\nso long as the present emphasis on the centrality of the<br />\nSaudis persists and indeed, I see every reason for assuming that the Washington-Jerusalem ties will further erode<br />\nas a conseuqence of administration policy.<br />\nN-L: What is the probability of a Palestinian settlement<br />\nin the Mid East?<br />\nTucker: On the probability of a Palestinian settlement<br />\nin the Middle East, I think the prospects for a settlement<br />\nare very low today. The Israelis have very little incentive<br />\nto push the Palestinian issue. The military balance is<br />\nsuch that it constitutes no incentive for the Israelis.<br />\nAmerican policy is such that it is almost a disincentive to<br />\nthe Israelis. On the other hand, the Arabs themselves<br />\nhave little reason to push for a settlement. Clearly, the<br />\nEgyptians can only find a role in this matter a political<br />\nliability and will probably attempt to detach themselves<br />\nfurther once the Sinai is returned to them in late April.<br />\nOn the other hand, the Saudis having suffered some<br />\ndegree of humiliation from their Arab friends in putting<br />\nforth their peace initiative of last fall , will be extremely<br />\nreluctant to put forth any new initiative. Besides, the<br />\nvery weakness of the Saudi position is such that they<br />\ncannot afford to go beyond beyond a very modest point<br />\nin their proposals. I think what we are in for now is a<br />\nfairly substantial period in which, despite Western<br />\npressures, both European and American, you will see<br />\nboth Arab and Israeli positions rather tight.<br /><br />\nThe United States in the Middle East<br /><br />\n(cont. from p. 13)<br />\nment of anything resembling a Palestinian state. Mubarak, seeking to regain credibility and a leadership role<br />\nin the Arab world, cannot settle for less. Most likely,<br />\nIsrael and Egypt will go their separate ways after Egypt<br />\ngets the rest of the Sinai back on April 26. Said Haig<br />\nrecently, \"Egypt will go back to the Arab world, with<br />\nthe U.S. isolated as Israel's sole defender. Egypt's<br />\nposition under Mubarak is 180 percent different than it<br />\nhad been with Sadat.\"<br />\nAs for the administration's policy of a \"strategic<br />\nconsensus,\" the fact that the Israelis and the Arabs still<br />\nconsider each other, not the Soviets, the greatest threat<br />\nto peace, has doomed it to failure. The Arab-Israeli<br />\nconflict is especially painful for the United States<br />\nbecause of apparent mutually exclusive interests. Global<br />\nstrategic interests dictate that the U.S. establish closer<br />\nties with the Arab states\u2014especially Saudi Arabia--yet<br />\ncurrently, this is only possible by loosening ties with<br />\nIsrael, our closest friend and longtime ally in the region.<br />\nThis perception of a fundamental conflict of interests is<br /><br />\nprincipally responsible for the steady deterioration of<br />\nthe Israeli-American relationship. Neither has the Begin<br />\ngovernment helped much in this regard. Reagan twice<br />\nhad to delay the delivery of planes to Israel because<br />\nof the bombings of the Iraqi nuclear power plant and the<br />\nPLO bases in Beirut, and he was later forced to cancel<br />\nthe security cooperation pact because of the Israeli<br />\nannexation of the Golan Heights. Problems also arose<br />\nover which countries were to send troops to the buffer<br />\nzone between Israel and Egypt in the Sinai. Especially<br />\nworrying to the U.S. today is the possibility of an<br />\nIsraeli invasion into southern Lebanon to remove the<br />\nthreat of PLO forces there. An invasion could easily<br />\nprecipitate another Mid-East and even lead to a superpower confrontation.<br />\nAs a consequence of the current failure of<br />\nlong-range political strategy, U.S. foreign policy in the<br />\nMid-East consists primarily of the sale of arms. Here,<br />\nReagan has had some success. After a difficult fight he<br />\npushed the AWACs arms package through the Senate,<br />\nand joint maneuvers with Egyptian forces effectively<br /><br />\ndisplayed U.S. muscle. Also, the administration is trying<br />\nto convince Jordan to buy American rather than Soviet<br />\narms.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Administration can point to<br />\nfew tangible gains from this policy of weapon sales.<br />\nSaudi Arabia, for example, has refused to give any<br />\nassurances about the use of the AWACs that might<br />\nplacate Israel and Hussein has given no indication that he<br />\nwill cancel the order for Soviet ground-to-air missiles,<br />\neven if the United States provides him with similar<br />\nweapons.<br />\nOverall, Reagan has had only fair success at best<br />\nwith his program. The Palestinian autonomy talks<br />\nappear permanently stalled, no strategic consensus on<br />\nthe Soviet threat can be reached, and relations with<br />\nIsrael have been strained. The Administration had one<br />\nshining success. when Philip Habib, the U.S. envoy,<br />\ndefused the Syrian anti-aircraft missile crisis and arranged for a cease-fire in Lebanon. However, this was in<br />\nreaction to events and not part of the President's policy.<br /><br />\nPAGE 16/ MARCH 5,198<br />\n.mm)ma<br /><br />\n.,)mmdavo)fff.).=\u2022)\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nasohme.bm.hmtb..)...4m.<br /><br />\n1 \" PINE BROOK CHINESE RESTAURANT<br /><br />\nIMMIGRATION<br />\nPROBLEMS<br /><br />\nNorthern &amp; Szechtern Style Cuisine<br />\n1011 W.360% Street<br /><br />\nBaltimore, Maryland<br /><br />\n467-2499<br /><br />\nWhy spend so much money for a meal at<br />\nthe other restaurants?

Though<br />\nI would have been happier if P.J. Soles<br />\nhad put in an appearance, kudos must<br />\ngo to the Student Council for providing<br />\nwhat Larry Lippin introduced as \"the first<br />\nreal concert at Hopkins...ever.\"<br />\nShriver contained a near capacity<br />\ncrowd for the show, which began at<br />\nabout 8:25 with a Baltimore warm-up<br />\nband, Null Set. Embodying some kind of<br />\nnihilistic, conceptually-obnoxious philosophy (the band wore only black), Null<br />\nSet, its lead singer resembling both Gary<br />\nNuman and Herman Munster, played a<br />\nloud and strident set concerned with<br />\n(what'else?) alienation and the decline of<br />\nsociety. The volume level revealed the<br />\nacoustic limitations of Shriver, for<br />\nanyone who had any misconceptions.<br />\nNot many of the audience were inspired<br />\nto dance, aside from several devoteescum-plants, who took to the aisles right<br />\naway (all wearing black).<br />\n***<br />\nPop punk. What a gas. Weekend<br />\npunks and concert-thirsty heathens. . .a<br />\nrowdy get-together with the Ramones<br />\nand warm-up band Null Set. Null Set<br />\nopened up with a few hot trendies and<br />\nblasted our poor little ears.
