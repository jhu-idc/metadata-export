After discussing at length the various methods by which a college may select<br />\nthe most likely prospects, Dr. Howard shows the hopelessness of the<br />\nsituation by the following two statements, \"Actually, any high school<br />\ngraduate can enter college, for if one college will not take him, he<br />\ncan go to another\" and \"\u2014I am disposed to believe that anybody ought<br />\nto go to college who really wants to.\" In other words, it is impossible to keep any high school graduate out of college and for this reason Dr. Howard advises that everyone who wants to should go to<br />\ncollege.<br />\nThe foremost defect in this system is stated in the second of the<br />\nseries of articles, \"The Rollins Idea,\" by Hamilton Holt. Dr. Holt<br />\nsays, \"For in the effort to build up the most elaborate machinery in<br />\nthe world for turning out academic degrees it seemed to me that we<br />\nhad somewhere lost the essence of true education, and that to find it<br />\nagain we must revert to simpler methods, fewer rules, less emphasis<br />\nupon information and more upon thinking.\"<br />\nAt Rollins for the last four years experiments have been made to<br />\neliminate these defects. The Rollins two-hour conference plan has<br />\nobvious advantages. Some of the more important changes are the<br />\nabolishment of lectures and recitations, the minimization of term and<br />\nyearly examinations, freedom of outside time, and the attempts to<br />\nreplace textbooks with life that is to say to give nothing second-hand<br />\nthat may be acquired first-hand by the student.<br />\nA teacher presides over each conference but he does not lecture,<br />\nnor does he hear recitations. His primary function is to keep quiet, and<br />\nto guide and stimulate work. The students study and discuss problems<br />\namong themselves. The situation seems ideal for the student who is<br />\nreally anxious to learn. Furthermore one student who advances more<br />\nrapidly than his fellows is not held in check by a slow class. With<br />\nthe aid of the teacher, he may in the course of a year, cover much<br />\nmore ground than his classmates. This system, of course, could not<br />\nbe immediately adopted by American colleges. Some students would<br />\nnot progress with this lack of rule and regulation. This type of student, however, is the type that needs to be eliminated. The primary<br />\nreason why the Rollins Plan could not be adopted is that a sufficient<br />\nnumber of teachers could not be found. One able teacher is needed<br />\nCollege men who know what to<br />\nfor every ten students at Rollins.<br />\nwear and how to wear it choose<br />\nAlligator \"50\"\u2014 the new College<br />\nThe plan seems to be a decided success at Rollins, but more experiCoat...

After discussing at length the various methods by which a college may select<br />\nthe most likely prospects, Dr. Howard shows the hopelessness of the<br />\nsituation by the following two statements, \"Actually, any high school<br />\ngraduate can enter college, for if one college will not take him, he<br />\ncan go to another\" and \"\u2014I am disposed to believe that anybody ought<br />\nto go to college who really wants to.\" In other words, it is impossible to keep any high school graduate out of college and for this reason Dr. Howard advises that everyone who wants to should go to<br />\ncollege.<br />\nThe foremost defect in this system is stated in the second of the<br />\nseries of articles, \"The Rollins Idea,\" by Hamilton Holt. Dr. Holt<br />\nsays, \"For in the effort to build up the most elaborate machinery in<br />\nthe world for turning out academic degrees it seemed to me that we<br />\nhad somewhere lost the essence of true education, and that to find it<br />\nagain we must revert to simpler methods, fewer rules, less emphasis<br />\nupon information and more upon thinking.\"<br />\nAt Rollins for the last four years experiments have been made to<br />\neliminate these defects. The Rollins two-hour conference plan has<br />\nobvious advantages. Some of the more important changes are the<br />\nabolishment of lectures and recitations, the minimization of term and<br />\nyearly examinations, freedom of outside time, and the attempts to<br />\nreplace textbooks with life that is to say to give nothing second-hand<br />\nthat may be acquired first-hand by the student.<br />\nA teacher presides over each conference but he does not lecture,<br />\nnor does he hear recitations. His primary function is to keep quiet, and<br />\nto guide and stimulate work. The students study and discuss problems<br />\namong themselves. The situation seems ideal for the student who is<br />\nreally anxious to learn. Furthermore one student who advances more<br />\nrapidly than his fellows is not held in check by a slow class. With<br />\nthe aid of the teacher, he may in the course of a year, cover much<br />\nmore ground than his classmates. This system, of course, could not<br />\nbe immediately adopted by American colleges. Some students would<br />\nnot progress with this lack of rule and regulation. This type of student, however, is the type that needs to be eliminated. The primary<br />\nreason why the Rollins Plan could not be adopted is that a sufficient<br />\nnumber of teachers could not be found.
