We do not know<br />\nanything about the finances relative to conducting either team,<br />\nbut we believe that the student body is in favor of basketball.<br />\nIn the first place, a swimming team, judging from the material<br />\navailable from last year, could at the very best make only a fair<br />\nshowing, and would probably make a very sorry one. A basketball team is at least a gamble.<br />\nIt is almost certain that the attendance at basketball games<br />\nwould be greater than that at the swimming meets for the past<br />\nfew years. Basketball is often a thrilling game to watch, whereas<br />\nmost swimming meets afford little excitement. If the question<br />\nof finances can be satisfactorily solved, the Athletic Council would<br />\nundoubtedly cater to popular opinion in establishing basketball as<br />\na minor sport.<br />\n<br />\nHow unfortunate that the University wits\u2014perhaps the two<br />\nwittiest wits of all\u2014should hide their lights under bushels until<br />\noccasion arises for derogatory and retroactive criticism, and then<br />\nappear in full force, but in rather an unfavorable light. We refer,<br />\nof course, to the recent exchange of caustic comment between the<br />\neditors of the two campus journals.<br />\nIt was not until the appearance of the recent issue of the Jay<br />\nthat editorials were included in the pages of our humorous magazine; sad to relate, when this first dedicatory blurb was printed,<br />\nall other humor, instantly put to shame, crawled back into its hole,<br />\nand threatens to stay there until editorials are denied space.<br />\nConsider the subtle satire exemplified in the Jay editorial. The<br />\nauthor \"merely wishes to point out that derogatory criticisms are<br />\nvery often retroactive.\" This, after a vivid description, pantingly<br />\nreal, of the make-up of the NEWS-LETTER. To have refrained,<br />\nunder the circumstances, from a damnation of derogatory criticism, would obviously have been a much safer procedure; but<br />\nwe must not forget that the editor is above all a humorist; therefore he criticizes derogatorily, and then criticizes derogatory criticism. Amazement\u2014breathless amazement\u2014such as that with<br />\nwhich we first greeted Lindy's triumph, is the first emotion provoked by this daring coup d'etat; then admiration begins its subtle<br />\nwork, and we acknowledge the writer as a master of whimsical<br />\nand astounding contradiction, a delightful humorist, and a worthy<br />\neditor.<br />\nThe man has a fondness for \"b's.\" His b's sting. And how!<br />\nAnd how? Beginning bitingly with bravado more boisterous than<br />\nhis brother's, be beats his blustering way, becoming better and<br />\nbetter as he brings up \"new brooms\" and \"dusty bulletin boards,\"<br />\nbattering down banalities with blows of his bludgeons and becoming bewitchingly brilliant with his beautiful b-stung \"bits of biweekly blarney.\" There! Ah, how heavily failure falls on an<br />\nunimaginative but thoroughly worshipful imitator! There is a<br />\nring in his style that none save Macaulay could have inspired or<br />\n:mitated, a splendid sonority, a weighty antithesis, a dignified<br />\nobscurity<br />\nOn the one hand, then, we have this newly-discovered humorist'<br />\nwho edits the Black and Blue Jay in his \"spare hours\"\u2014and it is<br />\nnot until his calm humor is ruffled in a well-directed but unnecessary attack, that his powers are noticed.<br />\nBut the other hand! We've had editorials for years and years;<br />\noccas'onally we have had interesting editorials; years ago, Henry<br />\nTurnbull wrote exciting editorials, but never has a humorist<br />\nsteered the NEWS-LETTER while another handled the Blue Jay.<br />\nAnother editor, confronted with such a blasting broad-side of<br />\nbombastic bull, would have done a very sane and extremely common-place thing; Henry Jarrett, for instance, would have ignored<br />\nthe remark and continued his pompous and sensible \"spare-hour<br />\nart\" without retort he would have been secretly proud of his<br />\nability to overlook such unmerited criticism.<br />\nBut did our Morton do that? Not he! Not for him, the<br />\nobvious and snooty silence; not for him, the devastating reply of<br />\nutter ignorance. No! He ups and says, \"S' Too Bad,\" with a<br />\ntwinkle in his eye, and then he sneers cynically through three<br />\nshort and snappy lines of retroactive criticism; for his opponents'<br />\ntouch about the Nazarene's proverb, he comes back quick as a<br />\nBlack and Blue Jay.\"<br />\nflash with a \"So's yer<br />\nthe review of the \"Regular Jay.\"<br />\nwrote<br />\nwho<br />\nknow<br />\ndon't<br />\nWe<br />\nAnother alliterator, with six \"Regulars.\" This author cleverly<br />\npretends to be injured. Is he? No!! He's merely another potential Voltaire, striking back at his first and most derogatory<br />\ncritic.<br />\nA. C. W.<br />\n<br />\nNOTE ON FRENCH<br />\nAny college course picked at random will offer many, targets<br />\nto would-be critics. Either the students, or the professor, or the<br />\nsubject matter of the course, or the manner in which the course<br />\nis conducted, usually has something wrong with it.<br />\nLike most courses, French 2 has a defect or two. How, when<br />\nmost undergraduates have difficulty appreciating English poetry,<br />\ncan they be expected to get either an intellectual or an oesthetic<br />\npleasure from reading French poetry? This has worried us for<br />\na long time. Part of French 2 consists of an appreciation of<br />\nMusset, Lamartine, de Vigny and a few others, but we doubt if<br />\nmore than one or two students each year are able to do any more<br />\nthan to translate these men's work more or less literally, much less<br />\neffect a literary translation. How much more would they appreciate the Contes drolatiques.,<br />\n<br />\nTWO ON THE SAME NIGHT<br />\nSome four or five years ago some one conceived the idea of.a<br />\nUniversity \"calendar\" as a means of avoiding the scheduling of<br />\nmore than one function on one night. Of course, like all minor<br />\nconstructive measures, it was adopted only to be forgotten immediately. Every year the Student Council exhorts the various<br />\nactivities to register its dates in the diary: every year there are<br />\nclashes.<br />\nTonight is the first. The Musical Club announced a tentative<br />\nschedule several weeks ago, setting tonight as the date of its opening concert. Through some one's carelessness, the Cotillon Club<br />\nhas also scheduled an affair for this evening. Tonight's conflict<br />\nis a relatively unimportant one, but even these could be avoided<br />\nif the managers would be more careful.<br />\n<br />\nWILL IT BE VERY, VERY MILD?<br />\nTomorrow the frosh and sophs will do something,they haven't<br />\ndone all year\u2014fight!

Yea, the embers<br />\nhave burst into flame through the<br />\nvery efforts of one whose work does<br />\nusually go unseen. How I have<br />\nmourned the lack of literary knowledge withheld from the unbeliever.<br />\nHow I envy the man who has the<br />\nPower to allow the author to see<br />\nhimself in print. His stupendous<br />\ngrasp of the grammatical makes the<br />\nordinary business man blush for<br />\nshame.<br />\nThis is not controversial\u2014I reiterate. The intention is not for literary value. It is the fulfillment of<br />\na desire. As one who is most unscholarly is it worth chancing an<br />\noutburst which might frankly prove<br />\nthe columns of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nare filled with pure unadulterated<br />\nbunk? How could I combat the<br />\ncriticisms of my literary style? It<br />\nhas not been cultivated, nourished<br />\nand then nursed along to such a<br />\ncrmax as \"Regularly, Regular<br />\nNumber of Blue Jay teems with<br />\nRegularity.\" I fear I should be<br />\nscourged by the lashing of a mortified yet cowering editor.

In the face of all this,<br />\nCaptain Mallonee led his men on<br />\nthe field to receive a welcome which<br />\nWould have been insulting to the<br />\nsecond alternate rebuttal of the<br />\ndebating team. Not a cheer-leader<br />\nWas in sight. About five minutes<br />\nlater they made their appearance<br />\nand came to life with a belated<br />\nHullabaloo. And then in that agonizing third quarter\u2014the cheer leaders and the student body acted as<br />\nthough they hadn't the slightest interest in whether Maryland continued their determined marches or<br />\nnot. It wasn't the fault-of the men<br />\nin the stands that Hopkins blocked<br />\nthat kick and staved off almost<br />\ncertain defeat. It wasn't due to<br />\nstudent support that those eleven<br />\ninen on the field didn't know what<br />\nit meant to be licked. We all saw<br />\nnothing short of inspired football,<br />\nbut it wasn't the west stand that<br />\nfurnished the inspiration.<br />\nAnd after the game\u2014after an exhibition that caused chills to run up<br />\nand down the spines of even disinterested spectators\u2014the student<br />\nbody gave a few unenthusiastic<br />\nchortles which were probably supPosed to be yells . . . and went<br />\nhome. Navy would have carried<br />\noff the goal-posts in triumph. Yale<br />\nwould have made the Baltimore<br />\nStadium reverberate with cheers.<br />\nAnd Hopkins\u2014after the first victory over Maryland in twelve years<br />\nafter bald-headed, decrepit alumni with grandchildren had behaved<br />\nlike Prep-school sophomores\u2014after<br />\nten thousand people had lost their<br />\nvoices, their good sense and five<br />\nYears off their life\u2014HOPKINS<br />\nWENT HOME.

It had been formerly<br />\nannounced that the same plan which<br />\nwas followed last year would be<br />\ncarried out this year, but for some<br />\nreason\u2014unknown to the common<br />\nherd\u2014the method of former years<br />\nwas thrown to \"pot\" and another<br />\nwas instituted, which should prove<br />\ncolorful and interesting at the very<br />\nleast.<br />\nObjective to Paint Pole<br />\n<br />\nThe new idea_ is this: there will<br />\nbe a pole imbedded in the ground<br />\nwhich will be about as high as one<br />\ncan reach without straining anything; this pole will be painted red<br />\nand will have the Sophomore class<br />\nas defenders. When the starting<br />\nwhistle is blown the Freshman class<br />\nwill move to attack with, cans of<br />\ngreen paint and, of course, the necessary paint-applying utensils; the<br />\ndefending Sophomores will have<br />\nred paint, and also their tools of<br />\napplication, and as fast as green<br />\npaint reaches the pole they will<br />\nendeavor to paint it with red again.<br />\nAt the end of five or six minutes<br />\nthe Student Council will have the<br />\nenvious job of deciding which class<br />\nhas the greater area of their color<br />\npaint upon the pole!<br />\nWith the necessary publicity the<br />\nevent should draw a monster<br />\ncrowd; and if only .a nominal fee<br />\nwere charged, there might be<br />\nenough money to enlarge Gilman<br />\nHall.<br />\nWhy the new plan is to be tried<br />\nand why such a plan should be<br />\nselected has not as yet been disclosed by the august Student Council.

We do not know<br />\nanything about the finances relative to conducting either team,<br />\nbut we believe that the student body is in favor of basketball.<br />\nIn the first place, a swimming team, judging from the material<br />\navailable from last year, could at the very best make only a fair<br />\nshowing, and would probably make a very sorry one. A basketball team is at least a gamble.<br />\nIt is almost certain that the attendance at basketball games<br />\nwould be greater than that at the swimming meets for the past<br />\nfew years. Basketball is often a thrilling game to watch, whereas<br />\nmost swimming meets afford little excitement. If the question<br />\nof finances can be satisfactorily solved, the Athletic Council would<br />\nundoubtedly cater to popular opinion in establishing basketball as<br />\na minor sport.<br /><br />\nHow unfortunate that the University wits\u2014perhaps the two<br />\nwittiest wits of all\u2014should hide their lights under bushels until<br />\noccasion arises for derogatory and retroactive criticism, and then<br />\nappear in full force, but in rather an unfavorable light. We refer,<br />\nof course, to the recent exchange of caustic comment between the<br />\neditors of the two campus journals.<br />\nIt was not until the appearance of the recent issue of the Jay<br />\nthat editorials were included in the pages of our humorous magazine; sad to relate, when this first dedicatory blurb was printed,<br />\nall other humor, instantly put to shame, crawled back into its hole,<br />\nand threatens to stay there until editorials are denied space.<br />\nConsider the subtle satire exemplified in the Jay editorial. The<br />\nauthor \"merely wishes to point out that derogatory criticisms are<br />\nvery often retroactive.\" This, after a vivid description, pantingly<br />\nreal, of the make-up of the NEWS-LETTER. To have refrained,<br />\nunder the circumstances, from a damnation of derogatory criticism, would obviously have been a much safer procedure; but<br />\nwe must not forget that the editor is above all a humorist; therefore he criticizes derogatorily, and then criticizes derogatory criticism. Amazement\u2014breathless amazement\u2014such as that with<br />\nwhich we first greeted Lindy's triumph, is the first emotion provoked by this daring coup d'etat; then admiration begins its subtle<br />\nwork, and we acknowledge the writer as a master of whimsical<br />\nand astounding contradiction, a delightful humorist, and a worthy<br />\neditor.<br />\nThe man has a fondness for \"b's.\" His b's sting. And how!<br />\nAnd how? Beginning bitingly with bravado more boisterous than<br />\nhis brother's, be beats his blustering way, becoming better and<br />\nbetter as he brings up \"new brooms\" and \"dusty bulletin boards,\"<br />\nbattering down banalities with blows of his bludgeons and becoming bewitchingly brilliant with his beautiful b-stung \"bits of biweekly blarney.\" There! Ah, how heavily failure falls on an<br />\nunimaginative but thoroughly worshipful imitator! There is a<br />\nring in his style that none save Macaulay could have inspired or<br />\n:mitated, a splendid sonority, a weighty antithesis, a dignified<br />\nobscurity<br />\nOn the one hand, then, we have this newly-discovered humorist'<br />\nwho edits the Black and Blue Jay in his \"spare hours\"\u2014and it is<br />\nnot until his calm humor is ruffled in a well-directed but unnecessary attack, that his powers are noticed.<br />\nBut the other hand! We've had editorials for years and years;<br />\noccas'onally we have had interesting editorials; years ago, Henry<br />\nTurnbull wrote exciting editorials, but never has a humorist<br />\nsteered the NEWS-LETTER while another handled the Blue Jay.<br />\nAnother editor, confronted with such a blasting broad-side of<br />\nbombastic bull, would have done a very sane and extremely common-place thing; Henry Jarrett, for instance, would have ignored<br />\nthe remark and continued his pompous and sensible \"spare-hour<br />\nart\" without retort he would have been secretly proud of his<br />\nability to overlook such unmerited criticism.<br />\nBut did our Morton do that? Not he! Not for him, the<br />\nobvious and snooty silence; not for him, the devastating reply of<br />\nutter ignorance. No! He ups and says, \"S' Too Bad,\" with a<br />\ntwinkle in his eye, and then he sneers cynically through three<br />\nshort and snappy lines of retroactive criticism; for his opponents'<br />\ntouch about the Nazarene's proverb, he comes back quick as a<br />\nBlack and Blue Jay.\"<br />\nflash with a \"So's yer<br />\nthe review of the \"Regular Jay.\"<br />\nwrote<br />\nwho<br />\nknow<br />\ndon't<br />\nWe<br />\nAnother alliterator, with six \"Regulars.\" This author cleverly<br />\npretends to be injured. Is he? No!! He's merely another potential Voltaire, striking back at his first and most derogatory<br />\ncritic.<br />\nA. C. W.<br /><br />\nNOTE ON FRENCH<br />\nAny college course picked at random will offer many, targets<br />\nto would-be critics. Either the students, or the professor, or the<br />\nsubject matter of the course, or the manner in which the course<br />\nis conducted, usually has something wrong with it.<br />\nLike most courses, French 2 has a defect or two. How, when<br />\nmost undergraduates have difficulty appreciating English poetry,<br />\ncan they be expected to get either an intellectual or an oesthetic<br />\npleasure from reading French poetry? This has worried us for<br />\na long time. Part of French 2 consists of an appreciation of<br />\nMusset, Lamartine, de Vigny and a few others, but we doubt if<br />\nmore than one or two students each year are able to do any more<br />\nthan to translate these men's work more or less literally, much less<br />\neffect a literary translation. How much more would they appreciate the Contes drolatiques.,<br /><br />\nTWO ON THE SAME NIGHT<br />\nSome four or five years ago some one conceived the idea of.a<br />\nUniversity \"calendar\" as a means of avoiding the scheduling of<br />\nmore than one function on one night. Of course, like all minor<br />\nconstructive measures, it was adopted only to be forgotten immediately. Every year the Student Council exhorts the various<br />\nactivities to register its dates in the diary: every year there are<br />\nclashes.<br />\nTonight is the first. The Musical Club announced a tentative<br />\nschedule several weeks ago, setting tonight as the date of its opening concert. Through some one's carelessness, the Cotillon Club<br />\nhas also scheduled an affair for this evening. Tonight's conflict<br />\nis a relatively unimportant one, but even these could be avoided<br />\nif the managers would be more careful.<br /><br />\nWILL IT BE VERY, VERY MILD?<br />\nTomorrow the frosh and sophs will do something,they haven't<br />\ndone all year\u2014fight!

Yea, the embers<br />\nhave burst into flame through the<br />\nvery efforts of one whose work does<br />\nusually go unseen.

His stupendous<br />\ngrasp of the grammatical makes the<br />\nordinary business man blush for<br />\nshame.<br />\nThis is not controversial\u2014I reiterate. The intention is not for literary value. It is the fulfillment of<br />\na desire.

It had been formerly<br />\nannounced that the same plan which<br />\nwas followed last year would be<br />\ncarried out this year, but for some<br />\nreason\u2014unknown to the common<br />\nherd\u2014the method of former years<br />\nwas thrown to \"pot\" and another<br />\nwas instituted, which should prove<br />\ncolorful and interesting at the very<br />\nleast.<br />\nObjective to Paint Pole<br /><br />\nThe new idea_ is this: there will<br />\nbe a pole imbedded in the ground<br />\nwhich will be about as high as one<br />\ncan reach without straining anything; this pole will be painted red<br />\nand will have the Sophomore class<br />\nas defenders. When the starting<br />\nwhistle is blown the Freshman class<br />\nwill move to attack with, cans of<br />\ngreen paint and, of course, the necessary paint-applying utensils; the<br />\ndefending Sophomores will have<br />\nred paint, and also their tools of<br />\napplication, and as fast as green<br />\npaint reaches the pole they will<br />\nendeavor to paint it with red again.<br />\nAt the end of five or six minutes<br />\nthe Student Council will have the<br />\nenvious job of deciding which class<br />\nhas the greater area of their color<br />\npaint upon the pole!<br />\nWith the necessary publicity the<br />\nevent should draw a monster<br />\ncrowd; and if only .a nominal fee<br />\nwere charged, there might be<br />\nenough money to enlarge Gilman<br />\nHall.<br />\nWhy the new plan is to be tried<br />\nand why such a plan should be<br />\nselected has not as yet been disclosed by the august Student Council. Several plans were under consideration; an investigation of the<br />\nsituation having been conducted by<br />\nJ. Hamilton Allen, Junior delegate<br />\nto the Council.
