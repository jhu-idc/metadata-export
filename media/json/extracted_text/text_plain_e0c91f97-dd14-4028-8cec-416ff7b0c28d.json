In order to facilitate a judicial distribution, the Committee<br />\nassists the Ibusiness managers of the<br />\nvarious activities in drawing up their<br />\nfinancial budgets. It is the purpose<br />\nof the committee to supervise all expenditures in the endeavor to follow<br />\nthe proposed budgets as closely as<br />\npossible. This year the Committee<br />\ninaugurated a system of requisitions<br />\nwhich has proven to be an important<br />\nfactor in the checking of all disbursements.<br />\nThe Dean's Advisory Committee on<br />\nStudent Activities, which is the full<br />\nname of the S.A.C., is the successor<br />\nto the Student Activities Council,<br />\nand has, consequently, taken over<br />\nthe duties of that organization. The<br />\nCouncil, which consisted of the heads<br />\nof all the activities, and was too large<br />\nand unwieldy to be efficient, was reorganized at the instigation of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees of the University<br />\nin 1934. Since this change in organization, graft in the activities has<br />\nbeen eliminated, and all transactions<br />\nhave been carried out in a much<br />\nmore orderly and business-like fashion. Other functions of the Committee include assistance in drawing<br />\nup and amending constitutions of<br />\nthe activities and supervising the<br />\nelections in an effort to enforce observance of these constitutions and<br />\nto minimize unfair politics. This year,<br />\nthe Committee offered a set of<br />\nstandardized election by - laws to<br />\nthe activities which will again be<br />\npresented for approval to the new<br />\nofficers of the activities for next<br />\nyear. The purpose of these by - laws<br />\nwas to simplify election procedures<br />\nand to attempt to give every candidate for membership or office a<br />\nsquare deal. Finally, the Student<br />\nActivities Committee awards the<br />\nVarsity Seal to those men who have<br />\ngiven three years of active service<br />\nto extra - curricular activities.<br />\nThe members of the Committee<br />\nare appointed annually by the President of the University on the recommendation of the Dean. An effort<br />\nis made to select men whose integrity<br />\nis beyond question, and who have<br />\nproven themselves efficient in an<br />\nunderstanding of the activities in<br />\nwhich they have taken a part.<br />\n<br />\nIn Organization<br />\n<br />\n\"The same forces which brought<br />\nthe world into the last war, which<br />\nkept the world from making peace,<br />\nare leading the world straight into<br />\nanother war.

A<br />\n\"Fascist International\" has been created, and is at present fighting it<br />\nout in Spain. The United States and<br />\nGreat Britain are directly and indirectly aiding the cause of Spanish<br />\nFascists, and the very word 'neutrality' in the neutrality bill is a deception,\" he said.<br />\nDr. Ward feels that the present<br />\neconomic prosperity is based almost<br />\nentirely on the increased manufacture of armaments, and is not a true<br />\nprosperity. He attacked the Neutrality Bill, on the grounds that it<br />\napplied sanctions against the legitimate Spanish government.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Robert B. Roulston, editor-inchief of the Johns Hopkins alumni<br />\nmagazine for 20 years, has recently<br />\nresigned. Dr. Roulston's resignation,<br />\naccording to the Alumni Association,<br />\nfollowed a request from Dr. Roulston<br />\nthat he be relieved from the exacting<br />\nduties of the office in view of his long<br />\ntenure in office.<br />\nThe resignation, which was accepted by the Alumni Association, is<br />\nto be effective with the issuance of<br />\nthe August number, sometime this<br />\nsummer. As yet, no new editor has<br />\nben appointed, and at the present<br />\ntime a temporary committee is guiding the destiny of the magazine.<br />\nAt the same time, Mr. Thomas<br />\nHubbard,- secretary of the organization, revealed several major changes<br />\nin the Alumni Association organization. A committee, appointed last<br />\nyear and headed by E. Guy Stapleton,<br />\nstudied the set-up, and issued a report<br />\nwhich defined the purpose of the association, and recommended changes \u2022<br />\nIn the organization. The report has<br />\nbeen accepted by the association as<br />\na pattern for its development.<br />\nIt dealt with the raising of funds<br />\nby the organization, and alumni activities. At the last meeting, the<br />\nfollowing officers of the association<br />\nwere elected: J. A. Dushane Penniman, president; Guy F. Hollyday,<br />\nvice-president; Thomas F.

In order to facilitate a judicial distribution, the Committee<br />\nassists the Ibusiness managers of the<br />\nvarious activities in drawing up their<br />\nfinancial budgets. It is the purpose<br />\nof the committee to supervise all expenditures in the endeavor to follow<br />\nthe proposed budgets as closely as<br />\npossible. This year the Committee<br />\ninaugurated a system of requisitions<br />\nwhich has proven to be an important<br />\nfactor in the checking of all disbursements.<br />\nThe Dean's Advisory Committee on<br />\nStudent Activities, which is the full<br />\nname of the S.A.C., is the successor<br />\nto the Student Activities Council,<br />\nand has, consequently, taken over<br />\nthe duties of that organization. The<br />\nCouncil, which consisted of the heads<br />\nof all the activities, and was too large<br />\nand unwieldy to be efficient, was reorganized at the instigation of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees of the University<br />\nin 1934. Since this change in organization, graft in the activities has<br />\nbeen eliminated, and all transactions<br />\nhave been carried out in a much<br />\nmore orderly and business-like fashion. Other functions of the Committee include assistance in drawing<br />\nup and amending constitutions of<br />\nthe activities and supervising the<br />\nelections in an effort to enforce observance of these constitutions and<br />\nto minimize unfair politics. This year,<br />\nthe Committee offered a set of<br />\nstandardized election by - laws to<br />\nthe activities which will again be<br />\npresented for approval to the new<br />\nofficers of the activities for next<br />\nyear. The purpose of these by - laws<br />\nwas to simplify election procedures<br />\nand to attempt to give every candidate for membership or office a<br />\nsquare deal. Finally, the Student<br />\nActivities Committee awards the<br />\nVarsity Seal to those men who have<br />\ngiven three years of active service<br />\nto extra - curricular activities.<br />\nThe members of the Committee<br />\nare appointed annually by the President of the University on the recommendation of the Dean. An effort<br />\nis made to select men whose integrity<br />\nis beyond question, and who have<br />\nproven themselves efficient in an<br />\nunderstanding of the activities in<br />\nwhich they have taken a part.<br /><br />\nIn Organization<br /><br />\n\"The same forces which brought<br />\nthe world into the last war, which<br />\nkept the world from making peace,<br />\nare leading the world straight into<br />\nanother war.

The United States and<br />\nGreat Britain are directly and indirectly aiding the cause of Spanish<br />\nFascists, and the very word 'neutrality' in the neutrality bill is a deception,\" he said.<br />\nDr. Ward feels that the present<br />\neconomic prosperity is based almost<br />\nentirely on the increased manufacture of armaments, and is not a true<br />\nprosperity.
