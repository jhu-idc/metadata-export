Du Pont is unquestionably a large company<br />\nin total number of employees and in all its operations.<br />\nBut, actually, Du Pont is made up of ten independent<br />\ndepartments, almost as if it were ten companies under<br />\none management. And it is a fundamental policy at<br />\nDu Pont to promote from within and on merit only.<br />\nThat produces many opportunities for new men, but<br />\nin addition there are proportionately more promotions<br />\nat Du Pont each year\u2014by reason of expansion and retirement\u2014than you would find in most smaller companies. I say \"proportionately more\" because Du Pont<br />\nhas grown at an average rate of seven per cent a year for<br />\nthe past 153 years\u2014a record that few companies can<br />\nmatch.<br />\nAnd Du Pont is still growing rapidly.

Du Pont is unquestionably a large company<br />\nin total number of employees and in all its operations.<br />\nBut, actually, Du Pont is made up of ten independent<br />\ndepartments, almost as if it were ten companies under<br />\none management.
