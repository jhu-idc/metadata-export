If we can<br />\ndevelop a black situation in which to<br />\nplace black kids they'll be able to<br />\ncompete and won't feel alienated.\"<br />\nSocial Life?<br />\nThe social life at Hopkins, black<br />\nstudents concurred, is the antithesis of<br />\nthat at black high schools. Dating,<br />\nwhich is the dominant social activity at<br />\nHopkins, is rare at black shcools. \"Guys<br />\nand girls at black schools just get<br />\ntogether all the time to have parties, go<br />\nto the movies, and have a good time,\" as<br />\na black junior put it.<br />\nWhile several black freshmen were<br />\nbitter about the scarcity of black girls at<br />\ntraditional Hopkins dating sources,<br />\nothers were confident that they could<br />\n\"get together and create a black social<br />\nlife.\"<br />\nRobert Owens, newly appointed<br />\nAssistant Director of Admissions, felt<br />\nthat the black freshmen would be able<br />\nto do this. \"They're a good, close group<br />\nof guys,\" he said, \"who've gone out of<br />\ntheir way to meet and help each other<br />\nout. They've been getting together for<br />\nsmall parties and basketball games and<br />\nare pushing toward developing a social<br />\nlife.\"<br />\nOwens, a native of Arkansas and<br />\ngraduate of Arkansas A and M, is also<br />\nsecretary of Multi-Line Enterprises, a<br />\ncorporation planning to create jobs and<br />\ntrain the unemployed in the ghetto. His<br />\nrole at Hopkins will be to attract<br />\nqualified black students to Hopkins and<br />\naid those here in any way he can.<br />\nA key factor in attracting black<br />\nstudents is the kind of feedback which<br />\ncomes from Negroes enrolled at<br />\nHopkins; until there is a sizable black<br />\ncommunity at Hopkins, things will bc<br />\ndifficult for black students here now.<br />\nOwens observed. This constitutes a<br />\ncircle that he feels he must deal with in<br />\norder to do his job effectively.<br />\nLast Spring a committee was formed<br />\nand discussions were held concerning<br />\nthe development of a remedial program<br />\nwith which to qualify economically and<br />\nacademically disadvantaged black<br />\nyouths for Hopkins. According to Allen<br />\nKimball, Dean of Arts and Sciences, the<br />\nplan was never carried through because<br />\n'you simply can't take a person whate<br />\nSAT scores are way below Hopkins'<br />\nnormal range and suddenly bring his<br />\nlevel way up.\"<br />\nEducation no Slaughter<br />\nOwens agreed that such a remedial<br />\nprogram would be impractical. \"We<br />\nwant students to come here for an<br />\neducation,\" he said, \"not to be<br />\nacademically , slaughtered.\" He felt that<br />\nhis job is to let black students know<br />\nthat Hopkins is available if they can<br />\nqualify.<br />\nSeveral black students observed that<br />\nguidance counselors tend to advise<br />\nstudents at predominantly black 'high<br />\nschools against coming to Hopkins.<br />\nOwens expressed the intention of<br />\nspeaking with teachers, counselors, and<br />\nstudents form a wide variety of schools<br />\nto counteract this. He noted that several<br />\nblack freshmen have volunteered to help<br />\nhim do this.<br />\nPart of Hopkins' difficulty in<br />\nattracting black students stems from<br />\nhaving standards comparable to ivy<br />\nleague schools without as attractive a<br />\nreputation. \"Any black student who<br />\nqualifies for Hopkins,\" explained senior<br />\nCharley Wood, \"will also qualify for<br />\nHarvard, Cornell, Princeton, and so<br />\nforth. Unless he's a pre-med, Hopkins'<br />\nimage doesn't really stick.\"<br />\nIn the meantime Hopkins is taking<br />\nno specific action to promote the<br />\neducation of black people. When the<br />\nremedial program was discarded last<br />\nSpring, according to Dean Kimball, it<br />\nwas decided that Hopkins could best<br />\nserve the black community by taking a<br />\nleadership role in establishing<br />\nmechanisms to identify black students<br />\nof the Baltimore-Washington area<br />\ncapable of going to college and helping<br />\nthem 'get into some scho.ong yet,<br />\nhowever, has been done to 14is eand<br />\nexplained Kimball.<br />\nar .<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE Sept. 26, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nAirlines Expected to Raise Youth Fares by 10%<br />\nBy RICK FITCH<br />\n(CPS) Airline youth fares will continue, but<br />\nnot at the current half-price discount.<br />\nThe five-man Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)<br />\ndecided here this month that while the fares,<br />\nwhich enable persons aged 12-22 to fly standby<br />\nat low cost, were fair in principle, airlines should<br />\nbe allowed to raise them to 60 per cent of the<br />\nregular coach fare.<br />\nthe reason: steep wage settlements, more expensive<br />\nfuel, and higher landing fees have lowered airline profits<br />\nexcessively, according to the CAB,and price increases in<br />\nboth regualr and promotional discounts are necessary to<br />\nincrease revenue. The major air carriers offering special<br />\nyouth fares - - American, Continental, Northwest, TWA,<br />\nUnited, Eastern, and Western - - are expected to take<br />\nadvantage of the CAB ruling and raise their prices. The<br />\nnew rates will take effect October 1.<br />\nA CAB spokesman said further hearings will be held<br />\non the \"economics\" of the discount rate as soon as a<br />\n<br />\ncourt case brought by Trailways Bus Systems against the<br />\nCAB in settled. Trailways contends that it is<br />\ndiscriminatory for there to be any discount for youth at<br />\nall, since adults must pay full fare.<br />\nThe youth fare issue was forced to a head last<br />\nJanuary when several bus companies, all of which had<br />\nlost business to the airlines because of the fares, filed<br />\nsuit to make the CAB listen to their arguments that the<br />\ndiscounts were illegal.<br />\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans,<br />\nagreeing with some of the arguments, ordered the CAB<br />\nto investigate. CAB examiner Arthur S. Present<br />\nsubsequently found the fares to be \"unjustly<br />\ndiscriminatory\" and in violaltion of the Federal Aviation<br />\nAct of 1958.<br />\nCAB Deluged<br />\nPresent recommended that the fares be abolished, but<br />\nthe CAB delayed action when protests were registered<br />\nby the National Student Association, the Campus<br />\nAmericans for Democratic Action, the National Student<br />\nMarketing Corporation, and many students and parents<br />\nwho deluged CAB offices with letters. Three measures<br />\n<br />\nwere introduced in Congress in support of the low-cost<br />\nyouth fares.<br />\nIn its recent decision, the CAB concluded, contrary<br />\nto Present's earlier findings, that the fares were not<br />\ndiscriminatory, but benefited all travelers. By<br />\nengendering development of a new market, they \"have<br />\ncontributed sizeably to making modern equipment and<br />\nconvenient schedules more broadly available,\" the CAB<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"It is clear that the youth standby fares have<br />\ngenerated a significant amount of new traffic,\" it said.<br />\n\"The 12-22 year age groups are more responsive to price<br />\nthan is the market as a whole. Moreover, in addition to<br />\nthe short-run generative a significant amount of new<br />\ntraffic,\" it said. \"The 12-22 year age groups are more<br />\nresponsive to price than is the market as a whole.<br />\nMoreover, in addition to the short-run generative effect<br />\nof youth fares, the long-term traffic impact is also<br />\nsignificant. By encouraging persons to travel by air at an<br />\nearly age the fares will inculcate habits ... which will be<br />\nreflected in a ready acceptance of air travel throughout<br />\ntheir adult lives.\"<br />\n<br />\nWJHU Claims Necessity For FM Broadcast<br />\nHomewood-wide committee which<br />\nassigns priority to projects requesting<br />\ncapital improvement.<br />\n\"Even the high cost wouldn't<br />\ncompletely negate setting up something<br />\nlike that,\" Bilgrave continued. \"There<br />\nmight be other possibilities, like alumni<br />\nwith special interests in this.\"<br />\n<br />\nSitting in a steaming studio lost<br />\nsomewhere below the freshman<br />\ndormitory, a lone newsman speaks to<br />\nhis audience of late night freshmen.<br />\nRecord players are off in consideration<br />\nof their roommates and WJHU plays<br />\nsoftly in the background, providing<br />\nsome entertainment and some<br />\nconnection to the outside world.

Former station<br />\nmanager John Ewalt submitted a similar<br />\nproposal to the Committee on Student<br />\nActivities last semester. He was told at<br />\nthat time that his requires would have<br />\nto be put off until this year's budget<br />\nwas being formulated.<br />\nDr. Allyn Kimball, Dean of the<br />\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences, stated<br />\nthat last year's budget, while already<br />\napproved, presently awaits sufficient<br />\nfunding.\"The snack bar and the student<br />\n<br />\n\"To go FM, the station will only need twenty-four thousand dollars. Considering the size<br />\nof the University budget, that's not much.\"<br />\n<br />\nlounge are still awaiting money, and<br />\nthese are based on last year's budget,\"<br />\nhe said. Last year Mr. Bilgrave indicated<br />\nthat facility improvements of the snack<br />\nbar and the lounge hold priority over<br />\nWJHU's request.<br />\n\"Hot as Hell\"<br />\nBaird Thompson estimated that the<br />\ninitial cost of changing WJHU into an<br />\nFM station would be \"about $25,000.<br />\nThis would include the $12,500 cost of<br />\nmoving the station across the hallway<br />\nfrom its present position between the<br />\nlockers and the washing room \"where<br />\nit's hot as hell.\" Also included is the<br />\n<br />\ncost of soundproofing and air<br />\nconditioning the studio. $10,000 of the<br />\n$25,000 is needed for equipping the<br />\nconverted station. This would include<br />\nthe cost of a new antenna and other<br />\nspecialized equipment allowing the<br />\nstudio to broadcast in FM/Stereo.<br />\nThompson noted, however, that after<br />\ninstallation, the operatina cost of the<br />\nstation would \"nicely bfit into our<br />\npresent budget.\"<br />\n\"Unfortunately,\" noted Bilgrave, \"at<br />\npresent, it's just not feasible.\" He stated<br />\nthat the initial capital cost of equiping<br />\nthe station would be handled by a<br />\n<br />\nSoldier Arrested for Activism<br />\nComparable to certain states' laws<br />\nwhich prescribe up to 99 years for<br />\nsmoking marijuana is the military law<br />\nunder which a serviceman can face up to<br />\na 35 year prison sentence for publishing<br />\nan anti-war newsletter.<br />\nThe case in point concerns Rober<br />\nLee Priest, 25, a native Texan, who is<br />\nthe main character in a much-publicized<br />\ntrial involving the Navy, the D.C.<br />\nDepartment of Sanitation, and various<br />\norganizations which attempt to bring<br />\npublic attention and indignation to bear<br />\non cases involving freedom of speech<br />\nand press.<br />\nPriest, a Washington D.C. based<br />\nsailor, began the publication last April<br />\n(while stationed at the pentagon) of a<br />\nnewsletter called \"OM\u2014The<br />\nServiceman's Newsletter.\" The<br />\npublication, which was anti-war and<br />\nanti-military oriented, claimed<br />\ncirculation of 1,000 by its second issue.<br />\n<br />\nbasic to the founding of this country<br />\nthat it finds its basis in the First<br />\nAmendment to the Constitution\u2014then<br />\nmy crime is speech.\"<br />\nReally Free<br />\nAnd Priest's Lawyer, David Rein,<br />\nviewed the situation in the same light:<br />\n\"What we are left with are the real free<br />\nspeech issues.\"<br />\nMeanwhile, the case has had<br />\nrepercussions within the Washington<br />\nDepartment of Sanitation. Robert V.<br />\nHoward, a special agent for the office of<br />\nNaval Intelligence, testified at a<br />\npreliminary hearing late in July that the<br />\nsanitation department made a \"special<br />\npickup\" of trash at Priest's Washington<br />\napartment.

Were WJHU to<br />\nswitch to FM programming, Bilgrave<br />\nexplained, \"it ceases to be a student<br />\nactivity at Homewood and becomes a<br />\nvoice of the University.\" The station<br />\ncannot, therefore, lapse into an irregular<br />\npattern or inconsistent quality of<br />\nprogramming.<br />\nDean Kimball also noted that the<br />\nactivity cannot afford to become<br />\ninactive in future years. \"When you go<br />\ninto what goes beyond the Homewood<br />\ncommunity you must have continuity<br />\nfrom year to year.\" Bilgrave noted that,<br />\nin the past years, an activity of<br />\nexceptional quality one year can often<br />\ncompletely fall apart the following year<br />\ndue to regular staff changes. One<br />\npossible solution to these problems is<br />\nfor the University to provide a regular<br />\nUniversity official who can oversee the<br />\nstation from year to year. \"Our only<br />\nconcern is quality, not censorship,\"<br />\nstated Kimball.<br />\nAt present there are no qualified<br />\nprofessors or administrative officals who<br />\nhave the time to devote to such a<br />\nproject. Kimball did note, however, that<br />\nthat the University is presently trying to<br />\nincrease the staff of the Office of Public<br />\nRelations. \"Perhaps the man taking that<br />\npost will have the qualifications,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nKimball did admit that the switch<br />\nfrom AM to FM is inevitable. \"The only<br />\nquestion is when.

Walker, a<br />\nformer custodian at Hopkins who left<br />\nsoon after the first meeting of the<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nDriving Force<br />\nMr. Walker was the driving force<br />\nbehind the committee, and when he left<br />\nthe employ of the University, there was<br />\nno one with the leadership capabilities<br />\nto take over as acting head of the<br />\ncommittee. Thus, the committee has<br />\nnot been able to accomplish its ends.<br />\nMr. Wesley Taylor, former plant<br />\nmanager at Hopkins, said of Walker,<br />\nthat he was, \"very reasonable\", and<br />\n\"anxious to improve as much as possible<br />\nthe lot of all the workers\" . . . .

At the<br />\ntime it was decried by Walker as not<br />\nbeing a living wage. Since that time,<br />\nthere have been two increases in the<br />\nwages paid by the University. The first<br />\nincrease came on February 3rd, and<br />\nraised the starting wage of Hopkins<br />\nemployees to $1.60 per hour. On<br />\nSeptember 1st, the wage for employees<br />\nstarting at Hopkins was increased to<br />\n$1.80 per hour. Yet many workers still<br />\ncomplain that it is \"not a living wage\".<br />\nWishing to remain anonymous,<br />\n\"because this could cause a little<br />\ndisturbance upstairs\", one employee<br />\nstated, \"Let's face it. It's not a living<br />\nwage with the rise in the cost of living<br />\nand all.\"<br />\nHowever, Mr. George], a supervisor in<br />\nWhitehead Hall, stated that the new<br />\nstarting wage of $1.80 per hour was a<br />\n<br />\n\"fair wage\" considering that other jobs<br />\nof this sort in Baltimore pay the same<br />\nstarting wage.<br />\nAnother employee grievance is that<br />\na fter training an employee, the<br />\nUniversity does not increase wages<br />\nproportionate to the amount of time an<br />\nemployee has worked for the,<br />\nUniversity. This charge was denied by<br />\nMr. George] who said that every six<br />\nmonths the employees are eligible for<br />\npay increases if they are recommended<br />\nby the supervisor. ;Mr. Georgel also<br />\nnoted that there is a new shift<br />\ndifferential which provides for an 8c per<br />\nhour increase for those who work the<br />\n3:00 p.m. - 11:39 p.m. shift and a 12c<br />\nper hour increase for those who work<br />\nthe 11:30 p.m. - 8:00 a.m. shift.<br />\nThis system does not seem to work<br />\nhowever, judging from the large number<br />\nof turnovers in university hourly<br />\nemployees.<br />\nAnother of last year's grievances,<br />\nthat there were no black supervisors, has<br />\nyet to be resolved.<br />\nUnion Desired<br />\nThe University claims to be always<br />\nacting to find answers to employee<br />\ngrievances.

A major danger in<br />\nthis approach lies in the fact that when<br />\nthe original purposes and membership<br />\nof established representative groups are<br />\naltered, the traditional members are, in<br />\nsome instances, unsympathetic. Further,<br />\nwhen meetings are merely opened to<br />\nallow only observers, communication is<br />\nsuppressed, or worse, distorted.<br />\nI propose, therefore, that a<br />\nUniversity Senate be constituted at The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University - - a body<br />\nwhose aim shall be to consider and<br />\ndiscuss all questions pertaining to the<br />\nacademic and non-academic activities of<br />\nour institution. As in the case of other<br />\nspecial groups, this body should report<br />\nand make its recommendations directly<br />\nto the president of the University. Most<br />\nquestions of importance to the<br />\nacademic community should appear<br />\nbefore this group. However,<br />\npromotions, appointments, and tenure<br />\nquestions for faculty members would<br />\nremaind the responsibility of the<br />\nAcademic Council.<br />\nTo obtain a fair representation of<br />\nfaculty and students, I recommend that<br />\nthe group be composed of 50 percent<br />\nfaculty and 50 percent students, plus<br />\nthe president of the University, the vice<br />\npresident, the deans and associate deans.<br />\nA viable number should be of the order<br />\nof fifty people. The student<br />\nrepresentation could be divided equally<br />\nbetween undergraduate and graduate<br />\nrepresentatives. Because there are six<br />\nmajor academic groups on campus, a<br />\nconvenient method for obtaining a wide<br />\nparticipation of faculty whould be to<br />\nhave four 'faculty members elected from<br />\neach group (i.e., Humanities, Social<br />\nSciences, Biological Sciences, Physical<br />\nSciences, Engineering Sciences, and<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences.) With<br />\nfour elected members from each of six<br />\n<br />\ngroups, the faculty representation<br />\nwould amount to twenty-four. Through<br />\nthe leadership of the Student Council,<br />\nthe undergraduates should then elect<br />\ntwelve representatives, and the graduate<br />\nstudent governing board would in the<br />\nsame manner supervise the election of<br />\ntwelve representatives. I strongly<br />\nrecommend that all elections be popular<br />\nwithin a subdivision. This is to say that<br />\nthe four faculty members from a given<br />\ngroup; the undergraduate<br />\nrepresentatives would then be elected<br />\nby a popular vote of all the<br />\nundergraduates. Graduate students, like<br />\nfaculty, might be selected from the six<br />\ngroups, with two members selected<br />\nfrom each.<br />\nOnce the membership is established,<br />\nthe charge to the Senate is of vital<br />\nimportance. If this is to be an<br />\nauthoritative body, it must be in a<br />\nposition to consider major questions<br />\nconcerning the non-academic and the<br />\nacademic enterprise, excluding those of<br />\npromotions and appointments. Besides<br />\nthe regular business which is now<br />\nbrought before such groups as the<br />\nGeneral Assembly, this body could have<br />\nthe opportunity to view questions<br />\nwhich at the present time have no<br />\nforum where they can be aired. Such<br />\nproblems as student housing, student<br />\nstipends, and student activities cannot<br />\nbe brought before the general academic<br />\ncommunity at the present: a Senate<br />\nwould provide a means for dealing with<br />\nsuch questions.<br />\nThe Senate should establish its own<br />\nstanding committees. In fact, most of<br />\nthe standing committees of the<br />\nUniversity except those of the academic<br />\ncouncil should report to a Senate once<br />\nit has been constituted. In this manner,<br />\nmuch of the confusion and failure to<br />\n\u2022communicate can be avoided.<br />\nA proposal such as that outlined here<br />\nwill not satisfy all interested parties.<br />\nHowever, no proposal will be found<br />\nwhich is acceptable to all. To be both<br />\nfair and realistic, each participant must<br />\nconcede somewhat. I believe that the<br />\ndistribution of representatives and the<br />\ncharge to a Senate are the most<br />\nfundamental problems. If the balance of<br />\ninterest is shifted too far in favor of any<br />\none group, an assembly such as that<br />\nproposed will not be viable. The<br />\nUniversity represents the fundamental<br />\ninterest of all; therefore, the University<br />\nas a whole must be served.<br />\n<br />\nMany Advocate 'Openness'<br />\nAt Friday Assembly Meeting<br />\n<br />\nDr. Martin Larrabee, professor of biophysics, at the General Assembly.

He insisted that<br />\na major precendent would follow the<br />\napproval of open Assembly meetings.<br />\n\"This is a sweeping opening,\" he<br />\ndeclared, \"and I don't think we know<br />\nwhat we're getting into.\"<br />\nThe majority of the faculty, though,<br />\nrejected these views. Stated Dr. John<br />\nWhite, head of the history of art<br />\ndepartment, \"I think that if we are<br />\ngoing to exclude undergraduates it<br />\nshould be done openly and they should<br />\nknow the reasons behind the issue.\" He<br />\ncalled the motion for a private meeting<br />\n\"a delaying tactic.\"<br />\nDr. Tim Smith, education<br />\ndepartment chairman, also urged the<br />\nfaculty to support open attendance.<br />\n\"The presence of students when the<br />\nfaculty is making decisions seem no<br />\nthreat at all to me,\" he asserted.<br />\n\"Democratic countries have always had<br />\nopen meetings for the health of the<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nThe motion to delay the meeting was<br />\nsoundly defeated. A resolution by Dr.<br />\nSmith followed. It proposed opening<br />\nthe Assembly meetings to everyone<br />\ninside and outside the university, and it<br />\nwas also rejected by the faculty.

First,<br />\nhe predicted that no one would be<br />\nsatisifed with the fifty-fifty arrangement<br />\nhe had drawn up to balance the power<br />\nof students and faculty. In the proposal,<br />\nhe noted this probability, saying it<br />\nwould, \"not satisfy all interested<br />\nparties.\"<br />\nHe told the NEWS-LETTER that he<br />\n\"wrangled with the problem\" of<br />\ndistribution of seats for a long time<br />\nbefore he came up with the fifty-fifty<br />\nplan. He said that in order to achieve a<br />\nsolution to this problem \"everybody<br />\nmust be realistic,\" and he warned in the<br />\nproposal that \"each party must concede<br />\nsomewhat.\"<br />\nOwen stated that he expected<br />\nobjections from both students and<br />\nfaculty on the distribution of seats.<br />\nAlthough many faculty members<br />\nexpressed their support of the senate<br />\nproposal in the abstract, most had not<br />\nseen Owen's draft of the proposal and<br />\nrefused to comment on distribution of<br />\nseats and other specifics which it<br />\ncontained.<br />\n\u2022 The second objection to the plan<br />\nwhich- -Owen- \u2022 expects. -would. - come-<br />\n<br />\nprimarily from the faculty. Since the<br />\nfaculty has wielded almost absolute<br />\npower at Hopkins, it would have to<br />\nyield certain of its prerogatives if<br />\nstudents were granted a voice in the<br />\ndecision-making process.<br />\nThis would mean that the Academic<br />\nCouncil, now the body which has final<br />\nsay for most practical purposes would<br />\nno longer recommend directly to<br />\nPresident Gordon on most subjects. The<br />\nCouncil's recommendations would go to<br />\nthe Senate and if passed, then travel to<br />\nthe President's office.<br />\nHowever, in his proposal, Owen<br />\nreserves faculty appointments,<br />\npromotions and questions of tenure for<br />\nthe exclusvie control and consideration<br />\nof the faculty. This has long been one of<br />\nthe major arguments for refusing<br />\nstudents seats on the Academic Council.<br />\nFaculty members nearly unanimously<br />\nreject the idea that students consider<br />\nthese questions and most people<br />\ncontacted felt that had these matters<br />\nnot been reserved for the faculty, the<br />\nproposal would have no chance of<br />\npassage.<br />\nOwen believes that students have had<br />\ndifficulty obtaining a voice in the<br />\ndecision making process largely because<br />\nof tradition and not because faculty<br />\nmembers- - objected - -or principle to-<br />\n<br />\nstudents having that voice.<br />\nHe begins his proposal by explaining<br />\nthe difficulties inherent in amending<br />\nexisitng procedures and groups. \"A<br />\nmajor danger in this approach,\" the<br />\nproposal reads, \"lies in the fact that<br />\nwhen the original purposes and<br />\nmembership of established<br />\nrepresentative groups are altered, the<br />\ntraditional members are, in some<br />\ninstances, unsympathetic,\"<br />\nFor this reason, it is generally<br />\nbelieved that this type of proposal has a<br />\nmuch greater chance of passage than<br />\nwould a proposal to seat students on<br />\nsuch traditional bodies as the Academic<br />\nCouncil. Owen averred that he was<br />\npersonally fond of tradition, but for<br />\npragmatic reasons felt that it must be<br />\noverridden in . this case. \"Hell, if<br />\ntradition is causing half of the trouble,<br />\nlet's change the tradition.\"<br />\nOwen felt that he must be<br />\n\"extremely careful\" in his remarks<br />\nabout the proposal and his ideas for the<br />\nsenate. He and others who supported<br />\nthe idea are reluctant to discuss the<br />\nproposal's ramifications or the response<br />\nwhich they expect for fear of reducing<br />\nthe chances for passage.<br />\nHis aim is to \"get the ball rolling,\"<br />\nand hc.believes that once other people<br />\n<br />\nbegin to support the idea and work for<br />\nits implementation he \"won't be<br />\nneeded.\"<br />\nThe proposal, if approved by the<br />\nAcademic Council, would have to be<br />\napproved by Dr. Gordon as well. Owen<br />\nsaid that he discussed the idea with Dr.<br />\nGordon and others last June and that<br />\nDr. Gordon's reaction was \"generally<br />\nfavorable.\"<br />\nApparently, talk of a university<br />\nsenate or another body which would<br />\nalter the system of governance at<br />\nHopkins has been discussed among the<br />\nfaculty and administration for some<br />\ntime now. Dean Strider said that he had<br />\ndiscussed this and other ideas with<br />\nmany people other than Owen. \"We've<br />\nbeen rolling the idea around,\" he said.<br />\nThe first time the idea was expressed<br />\npublicly was at the Faculty General<br />\nAssembly last Friday when Owen stood<br />\nand recommended that such a senate be<br />\nestablished. Owen said he believed that<br />\nthe argument on whether to hold open<br />\nmeetings missed the point.<br />\nIn the proposal, he claimed that<br />\nobservers in meetings hindered<br />\ncommunication. In addition, he said, \"If<br />\nI were called into a meeting and told,<br />\n'you can listen but you can't say<br />\nanthing,'<br />\n,I'd tend to get angry.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE Sept. 26,1969<br />\n<br />\nJIrDIPWS<br />\neditors-in-chief:<br />\nbusiness managers:<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\n/Gem<br />\nRichard B. Cramer, Peter Harnik<br />\nGeorge Johnston, Kevin Kresock<br />\n<br />\nFor The University Senate<br />\nDr. Owen's proposal for a faculty-student senate at Hopkins is one of<br />\nthe most encouraging things to appear in the last several years. As Dr.<br />\nOwen freely admits, the idea itself is not astounding. Many other schools<br />\nhave instituted similar systems with good results. What is astounding is<br />\nthat something like this is being proposed for the Hopkins campus where<br />\nthe faculty has always been in control and has been hypersensitive to any<br />\nattempt to decrease that control.<br />\nThe fact is that with the establishment of a Senate, the Academic<br />\nCouncil will be relegated to the status of the Student Council and the<br />\nGraduate Advisory Committee. All three will be advisory bodies to the<br />\nmain Senate. Unless the members of the faculty who are responding<br />\nfavorably to the idea of a university senate are unaware of that fact, this<br />\nrepresents a dramatic change in attitude.<br />\nGiving students a true voice in the affairs of the university also<br />\nrepresents a dramatic shift in attitude for the faculty. Perhaps all that was<br />\nholding back the faculty from giving in on this point was its objections to<br />\nhaving students on the Academic Council. In terms of tradition and<br />\naesthetics it would have been an abortion. .So the only hope was an<br />\norganization other than the Academic Council. And that is precisely what<br />\nthe Senate's creation would achieve.<br />\nDr. Owen's proposal for a fifty-fifty allocation of seats between .faculty<br />\nand students is the best we can imagine. Any advantage 61/en to either<br />\nSide would render the proposal unacceptable to the side slighted.<br />\nThe only objection we can see to Dr. 'Owen's draft of the senate<br />\nproposal is that students are not given complete control over those affairs<br />\nvhich pertain only to them. While the faculty would have ,complete<br />\ncontrol over appointments, promotions and tenure (without which the<br />\nproposal would have no chance of passage),<br />\nstudents will not gain<br />\ncomplete control over student activities such as the Levering Hall<br />\nPi-ogr_Jlis, and the Student Activities Commission:<br />\nNevertheless, the proposal as it stands would do much to increase<br />\nstudent involvement and influence at Hopkins. Moreover,: once factilty<br />\nmembers see that the student body is not a monolithic . Monster which<br />\noccasionally rears its ogreish head to cause trouble, students may gain an<br />\neven greater measure of control over their existence..<br />\nEveryone seems. mildly optimistic about the proposal's chances for<br />\npassage by the Academic Council. But no one can say for sure what that<br />\naugust body. will decide.-There is the distinct possibility that thek:ouncii<br />\nWill swallow the proposal and send it to one of its- committees. That \u2022 kind<br />\nof\" digestion takes approximately four to six months.(It has also ben the<br />\ncustom that the students get nothing but the excrement.).<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIn many ways it has been the students who have made the introduction<br />\nof such a proposal possible. Hopkins is showing, in its own subdued way,<br />\nsome tremors from the widespread \"academic revolution.\" But students<br />\ncannot now sit back and \"let them take it from here.\" We do not<br />\nadvocate going out on strike at this point or anything else that dramatic.<br />\nThose histrionics are precisely the kind of .thing which this proposal<br />\nshould stave off. But students have to make it clear that they do favor the<br />\ncreation of a senate or some body which is in power and is constituted of<br />\nstudents and faculty. Telling one's professors should accomplish this.<br />\nEqually important, students have to make it clear. that they would he<br />\nmore than mildly upset if such a body is not created in the near future.<br />\nThis should not constitute a threat. No one is going to bomb Homewood<br />\nHouse if this proposal is scrapped. However, if the faculty is genuinely<br />\nconcerned about involving students, a unified and vocal student body.<br />\nwould aid greatly in the process.<br />\n<br />\nIN) ACCORD WITH A 06c(5(O') BY TH6<br />\nU.5. 5OPREMECOURT I HERCI341<br />\nINFORM YOU OF YouR RIGHTS.<br />\n<br />\nYOU HAVE MC RIGHT TO HAVE COUNSEL, PRESEMT THRoUC2HOUT INTER ROOATION.<br />\n<br />\nWrong Door.'<br />\n<br />\nOf Students and Studies Black<br />\n\u2022 \"There is really no mystery in the fact that each year Hopkins plans to<br />\nincrease the enrolment of black students and every year\" the enrolment<br />\nremains sma<br />\nThere is really very little at Hopkins which can attract black students.<br />\nThe academic atmosphere on this campus would lead One to believe<br />\n.that no black students attend Hopkins at all.

In the mid 1930's, the Federal Government was<br />\nstuck with a supply of surplus solutions in the form of<br />\nFederal Agents idled by the repeal of prohibition. At the<br />\nsame time, two widely polarized groups were stuck with<br />\ntheir own peculiar types of surplus solutions looking for<br />\na problem. Organized crime had an intricate and<br />\nwell-polished blackmarket and smuggling apparatus<br />\noriginally designed for bootlegging, while organized<br />\nconservatism and the professional morality pushers had a<br />\nphilosophy of abstention that had been frustrated and<br />\nnegated by the failure of prohibition.<br />\nA fourth group, the newly revitalized liquor lobby,<br />\nprovided a catalyst for the marijuana prohibition by<br />\nputting its weight behind the effort that would result in<br />\na near monoply for its product.<br />\nAll the solutions went on to create their problem.<br />\nThe Feds coagulated around the infant(b. 1930) Federal<br />\nBureau of Narcotics which sold the new prohibition with<br />\nthe kind of scare tactics that were a joke to rational,<br />\nmuch less knowlegable, minds.

Daddy, who had<br />\nbeen scarred shittless about drugs by pre-war<br />\npropaganda, was conditioned to the warm comfort of<br />\nthat handy flask he carried for the duration.<br />\nSo the tight coalition continued through the forties<br />\nand fifties, all the diverse elements of society happily<br />\nand profitably solving the problem they had created.<br />\nThere had been some trouble when the original problem<br />\nof the \"killer weed\" had been challenged by those (i.e.<br />\nMayor's<br />\nThe<br />\nMarijuana<br />\nCommittee<br />\non<br />\nReport , New York, 1944) who were in prossession of<br />\nenough medical statistics and raw courage to protest that<br />\nit just wasn't so, that the big deadly boogie man had no<br />\nclothes. But this problem of the problem had been<br />\nsolved by modifying the myth to the allegation that<br />\nmarijuana and hashish inevitably led to heroin addiction.<br />\nThis new lie was enough to push the coalition to its<br />\napex, the passage of the newer, tou4her 1956 Narcotic<br />\nControl Act, the Magna Carta of dope persecution.<br />\nWhat then has happened in the 1960's to weaken the<br />\ncoalition? First, as a result of both an increasing liberal<br />\ntrend in government, as well as an increasing<br />\ndisillusionment with government, the influence and<br />\nprestige of repressive agencies like the FNB suffered (at<br />\n<br />\nleast in the earlier part of the decade). As a result of this<br />\nweakening of mindless awe toward the government,<br />\nmore and more individuals became receptive to the idea<br />\nof defying govenrment when government stood between<br />\nthem and their personal desires and social beliefs (i.e. the<br />\ncivil rights drives).<br />\nThe increase in the marijuana market is explained by<br />\nthree additional factors: First, the increase in<br />\nimportance and influence of those groups who had been<br />\nmost familiar with the drug all along\u2014blacks, musicians<br />\nand the poor. Secondly, the maturing of a new<br />\ngeneration that had been relatively unmolested by the<br />\nscare tactics, a generation with money and with time to<br />\nexperiment and a generation educated not to believe in<br />\nold mythes. Thirdly, increased contact with narcotics<br />\nresulting from travel to such poppied pastures as<br />\nVietnam and the 50 state university systems.<br />\nThere is a fourth factor, something like a \"spirit of<br />\nthe times\", a special kind of mental anguish that<br />\nencourages extreme mental solutions or quests for these<br />\nsolutions. But it would take a veritable Ed Mendelsohn<br />\nof speculative sociology to try to detail that, here, now.<br />\nEnd of history. Today the coalition stands before us<br />\nweakened, withered in agony in such grotesque<br />\nmanifestations as the Baltimore busts and (trumpets,<br />\nIntercept.

Davis for Clean-Up<br />\n<br />\nByED MENDELSOHN<br />\nThe Democratic nomination of<br />\nHenry Gassaway Davis for Vice<br />\nPresident in 1904 is one of the few<br />\nnominations which is less easy to<br />\nexplain than the selection of Alton B.<br />\nParker for President. In the ensuing<br />\ncampaign, only two facts about Mr.<br />\nDavis became widely known. The<br />\ngentleman was between eighty and<br />\neighty-one years old, and his personal<br />\nfuture was between thirty and forty<br />\nmillion dollars.<br />\nThe faithless were so unkind as to<br />\nsuggest that Mr. Davis was nominated in<br />\norder to afford him an incentive to<br />\ncontribute to the Democratic campaign<br />\nfund. That this was indeed a motivation<br />\nfor the nomination scarcely serves to<br />\nmitigate the unpleasantness of such<br />\ncrass cynicism. Admittedly, in his old<br />\nage Mr. Davis had acquired a<br />\nconsiderable reputation for munificense.<br />\nHe had paid for a hospital in honor of<br />\nhis late son, and he had donated a high<br />\nschool to Piedmont, West Virginia. In<br />\n1904, Mr. Davis did not find the<br />\nDemocratic party an equally worthy<br />\ncharity, and he did not contribute<br />\nnearly as much as had been hoped.<br />\nThe only other obvious explanation<br />\nfor the nomination is that West Virginia<br />\nhad been something of a weathervane in<br />\npresidential elections. In ten contests<br />\nsince entering the Union, she had voted<br />\nnine times with the popular majority. In<br />\n1880 she balloted for Winfield Scott<br />\nHancock, who lost the popular vote by<br />\nless than 10,000 votes.<br />\nAdmittedly two of the state's<br />\nchoices, Tilden in 1876 and Cleveland in<br />\n, 1888, won the popular vote while losing<br />\n. The . electoral vote. Nevertheless,. the<br />\n<br />\nstate's record as a weathervane was<br />\ngood. John Alderson, who placed Davis<br />\nin nomination for Vice President, noted<br />\nthat West Virginia had a tendency to<br />\nvote with the nation.<br />\nIt can be affirmed that Mr. Davis' life<br />\nwas the sort of poverty-to-wealth saga<br />\nwhich myriad Americans would find<br />\nadmirable. Davis was born in 1823 in<br />\nWoodstock, Md. He was fatherless from<br />\nhis youth, and had little education.<br />\nShortly he joined the Baltimore and<br />\nOhio Railroad as a brakeman. He made<br />\nsteady progress, first to conductor and<br />\nthen to an executive position called<br />\nMaster of Transportation.<br />\nAs Master, Mr. Davis gained credit<br />\nfor a signal success. The existing<br />\npractice was for trains to travel only in<br />\ndaylight and rest overnight at stations.<br />\nDavis directed that trains run at all<br />\nhours. Even now, the B&O honors Mr.<br />\nDavis by running trains at night.<br />\nThe railroad assigned Davis to a<br />\nsupervisory position in the are in<br />\nVirginia which would secede from<br />\nsecession to become West Virginia.<br />\nSurveying the terrain, he determined<br />\nthat he could build his fortune faster by<br />\nexploiting the area's natural resources.<br />\nHe therefore resigned from the railroad.<br />\nWith his brother, he formed the<br />\ncorporation of Davis & Bro., which<br />\nshipped coke, coal and timer to such<br />\nlarge users as railroads.<br />\nDavis made an enormous fortune<br />\nrapidly. He facilitated shipping by<br />\nforming his own railway, the West<br />\nVirginia Coke and Coal Railroad, which<br />\nhe later sold at an appreciated value to<br />\nthe Wabash. He also acquired sufficient<br />\ncapital to organize the Piedmont Bank.<br />\nDavis began to express himself<br />\n<br />\npolitically as a natural outgrowth of his<br />\ncelebrity in his part of the state. He was<br />\nalways a conservative Democrat, save<br />\nfor an early period when he supported<br />\nHenry Clay. In the Civil War he opposed<br />\nthe secession of West Virginia from<br />\nVirginia. He disired the preservation of<br />\nthe Union, but did not belive that was<br />\nwas a proper means of preservation. His<br />\nposition resembled that of John Bell or<br />\nPresident Buchanan.<br />\nDavis opposed certain<br />\nReconstruction measures, particularly<br />\nthe Fifteenth Amendment permitting<br />\nNegro suffrage. After his election in<br />\n1884 President Cleveland emerged as<br />\nleader of the conservative Democrats,<br />\nand Davis and Cleveland were amicable<br />\nboth personally and politically. Davis<br />\nwas under consideration as Cleveland's<br />\nrunning mate in 1884, and he was thrice<br />\noffered positions in the Cleveland<br />\nCabinet.<br />\nDavis had never lost an election,<br />\nalthough he had not sought office for a<br />\nconsiderable period. He spent some<br />\nyears in the West Virginia Legislature,<br />\nand in 1871 commenced two terms in<br />\nthe U.S. Senate. His career in the Senate<br />\nis best characterized as unremarkable.<br />\nDavis never endulged in flights of<br />\noratory. He achieved the Chairmanship<br />\nof the Senate Committee on<br />\nAgriculture, and he preciently proposed<br />\nthe organization of Executive<br />\ndepartments of Agriculture and<br />\nCommerce. He resigned from the<br />\nSenate at the expiration of his second<br />\nterm to give closer direction to his<br />\nbusiness interests.<br />\nObviously the nomination of Davis,<br />\nlike that of Parker, was designed to<br />\n'appeal le the followers of Cleveland<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nrather than to those who idolized<br />\nBryan. Davis, like Parker, could claim<br />\nparty regularity; he had voted for Bryan<br />\ntwice, albeit without discernible<br />\nenthusiasm. It could not be said that<br />\nDavis' nomination expanded the<br />\nDemocratic vote from that which Parker<br />\ncould have achieved alone. There is an<br />\nadvantage to this, in that Parker and<br />\nDavis were admirably congenial in<br />\npolitical philosophy. If Davis had had to<br />\nsucceed Parker as President, there would<br />\nhave been continuity in the Executive<br />\nbranch.<br />\nDavis was expected to appeal' to<br />\nbusiness, as a conspicuOusly successful<br />\nentrepreneur. He might also appeal to<br />\nlabor, as he favored arbitration of labor<br />\ndisputes.<br />\nThe principal objection that can be<br />\nlodged against Davis' nomination is his<br />\nage. The Vice President has only one<br />\nindisputable function: if necessary, he<br />\nmust outlive the President. In 1904,<br />\nthere was no chartered life insurance<br />\ncompany that would have estimated<br />\nthat Davis could outlive Parker,<br />\nAdmittedly, Parker could have died<br />\nfrom assassination or another accident.<br />\nNevertheless, Davis was an elderly man<br />\nwho had given up active direction of his<br />\nbusiness enterprise, and it was<br />\nreasonable to suspect that he was<br />\ndubiously equipped to assume the<br />\nPresidency at short notice.<br />\nIt can finally be asserted that the<br />\nhonorable, conservative, lackluster Davis<br />\nably complemented a ticket headed by<br />\nthe honorable, conservative, lackluster<br />\nParker. Next week I shall wax ambitious<br />\nand attewpt to place the Parker ticket<br />\nin the 'historical perspective of the<br />\npost-Reconstruction Democratic party.<br />\n<br />\n\f,HOMEWD BALTIMORE Sept. 26, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nAbbie and Paul Gross Out City<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nTwo of Lenny Bruce's children came to Baltimore<br />\nlast weekend, bearing the Revolution. Accompanying<br />\nYippie leader Abbie Hoffman and Realist editor Paul<br />\nKrassner were thP less savory aspects of the<br />\nRevolution\u2014David Peel and the Lower East Side, and a<br />\ngenuine SDS contigent, complete with NLF flag and<br />\nready-made chants.<br />\nThe entire program was arranged by the<br />\nfreaks-in-residence at UMBC in Catonsville, also known<br />\nas Greaser College, U.S.A.<br />\nDavid Peel's group was preceeded by three seemingly<br />\nendless sets by some local groups, and when Peel came<br />\non, I felt my body tremble with a new sensation:<br />\nnausea. David Peel and the Lower East Side is a group of<br />\nfour tone-deaf acid freaks who decided one day to put<br />\non dark shades and become a \"revolutionary rock<br />\ngroup.\" Peel, a hoarse-voiced punk from some dark alley<br />\nin Brooklyn, is the group's leader, and he is distinguished<br />\nonly by his total lack of musical ability. Peel and his<br />\ngroup were also limited by their inability to play more<br />\nthan two chords. But they made the most of their<br />\nunfortunate handicap, and their varied repetoire<br />\nincluded such songs as, \"Have a Marijuana,\" \"legalize<br />\nMarijuana,\" \"Make Marijuana Legal,\" and, everyone's<br />\nfavorite, \"I Love Marijuana.\" Peel, though, can do more<br />\nthan sing, and in a charming 25 minute interlude of<br />\nrapid-fire wit, he came out with such knee-slappers as,<br />\n\"Moses was the first hippie, because he broke the tablets<br />\ninto two!\"<br />\nThe audience was remarkably passive in the face of<br />\nsuch an onslaught of mediocrity. Peel's group, however,<br />\nhas a record out on Elecktra, and you can't help but<br />\nadmire Peel's ability in conning the record executinves.<br />\nAfter Peel had mercifully cleared the stage, we all went<br />\ninto the gym to see a well-done film on Chicago.<br />\nThe Two Funnies<br />\nIn any case, I was soon outside again, waiting to see<br />\nthe two funniest revolutionaries in America.<br />\nBoth Krassner and Hoffman have been around for a<br />\nwhile, and although they have become more pro-violence<br />\nas our government gets more repressive, they are still as<br />\nclever as ever.<br />\nUsing the yardstick that all great satire is in bad taste,<br />\nKrassner must be considered one of the best satirists in<br />\nRealist , is<br />\nAmerica. The motto of his magazine,<br />\nOur only sacred cow is irreverence,\" and he has indeed<br />\nlived up to it.<br />\nKrassner and Pyne<br />\nFor example, Paul Krassner's appearance on the Joe<br />\nPyne Shoe must surely stand as one of the great<br />\nmoments in American television, although it was entirely<br />\nbleeped off the air.<br />\nWhen Pyne, an amputee, started insulting Krassner<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nabout Paul's acne, Krassner responded to Pyne,\"Do you<br />\ntake off your wooden leg before you make love to your<br />\nwife?\" Before the startled Pyne could respond with his<br />\nusual moroni *nsult, Krassner added, \"Or do you USE<br />\nyour wooden ieg to make love to your wife?\"<br />\nKrassner also once put forth a novel suggestion to<br />\nspeed abortion reform-rape all wives of legislators who<br />\nvoted against it. Paul imagined the poor wife saying to<br />\nher husband, \"Don't give me any of that 'living fetus'<br />\ncrap, you.shmuck!\"<br />\nNot surprisingly, Krassner says that the only two<br />\npeople who ever really influenced him were Lenny<br />\nBruce, and Abbie Hoffman.<br />\nHoffman in Trouble<br />\nAbbie Hoffman is by now one of the most famous<br />\nrevolutionaries in America. A veteran of civil rights<br />\nactivities and the antiwar movement, Abbie has become<br />\nthe leader of those freak-out masters, the Yippies.<br />\nAlthough, Abbie Hoffman delights in put-ons, he is now<br />\nin serious trouble.<br />\nHoffman, along with seven other antiwar leaders, is<br />\nbeing tried in Chicago for conspiracy to incite a riot,<br />\nstemming out of Daley's attempt to save face after the<br />\n1968 debacle at the Democratic Convention. Hoffman<br />\nand the others mayface ten years in jail, but he looked in<br />\ngood spirits anyway last weekend.<br />\nBefore giving samples from their speeches, I will have<br />\nto indulge in the Apologetic Liberal Syndrome. In other<br />\nwords. I don't agree with everything they say.<br />\nKrassner, dressed in a blue-denim outfit, spoke first.<br />\nHis wiseguy Jewish accent fitted perfectly the tenor of<br />\nhis speech. Seated behind him was that SDS contingent,<br />\nand Krassner had to suffer through their cries of \"male<br />\nchauvinist\" and \"revisionist pig\" as he made his<br />\ncomments. Mere written exerpts can only give you a pale<br />\nfacsimile of the real thing, so picture, if you can, a<br />\ncurly-haired guy grapsing a mike, and rapping in a special<br />\nway to the audience.<br />\n\"Did you dig the Miss America contest? What they<br />\nshould have had, instead of the usual bullshit talent<br />\ncontest, was a REAL talent contest. I mean, Miss New<br />\nYork would show how to put a ,diaphragm with one<br />\nfinger. And Miss Michigan would top her by saying,<br />\n'Listen, babe, I can shoot heroin without a needle!\", and<br />\nthen she does it with an ice-pick! Then Bert Parks would<br />\nclose the show by saying,'Very nice, girls.'\"<br />\nThe Women's Liberation Front girly really started<br />\ncursing Krassner when he launched into his next bit.<br />\nDirty Jokes<br />\n\"I've always tried to picture what the candidates<br />\nwould be like in bed with their wives. Like, I can see<br />\nGeorge Romney ejaculating prematurely. Nixon, you<br />\nknow, doesn't say, 'I'm coming! I'm coming! but, 'Let<br />\n<br />\nme make one thing very clear.' And Rockefeller, of<br />\ncourse, doesn't know what position to take.\"<br />\nHe continued, \"Everybody's been talking about<br />\nEasy Rider<br />\nas a great revolutionary film, that really<br />\ndefines a new morality. But I have an idea for a film that<br />\nwill really be revolutionary and polarize the entire<br />\nnation. What I'd like to see is a classy stag film, in<br />\nTechnicolor, with a good plot structure and beautiful<br />\nphotography. And it won't have just snatches of<br />\nsnatches, like in 'I am Curious,' but real spread shots,<br />\ninsertions, and so on. THAT would be a pioneering<br />\nfilm!\"<br />\nKrassner paused, and then started talking about the<br />\nwar, getting more serious as he went on.<br />\nThe Real Gap<br />\n\"I wonder,\" he said, \"whether Walter Cronkite<br />\nincluded Ho Chi Minh as part of the weekly body<br />\ncount.\" After the SDS chant of\"Ho Lives!\" died down,<br />\nhe started talking again.<br />\n\"The real generation gap is between a 19 year old<br />\ncollege kid worried about his career and a 14 year old<br />\nVietnamese child risking his life fighting the Americans.\"<br />\nBefore introducing Abbie, he concluded, \"As long as<br />\nothers aren't free, I'm not, so I try to see things through<br />\nthe eyes of a Vietnamese child.\"<br />\nAbbie bounced on stage next, dressed in all brown,<br />\nand started talking as his wild hair was whipped by a<br />\ncool breeze. He sounds like a hip Boston taxi driver,<br />\nwith the adjective \"fucking\" liberally sprinkled<br />\nthroughout his speech.<br />\nBig Sluggery<br />\n\"This trial, man, ain't a trial \u2014 it's the World Series in<br />\nthe American League of Injustice.

Like, maybe you<br />\nthink I should be sad about all this, but I'm not weeping<br />\nany tears. Because, dig, an indictment from the Federal<br />\ngovernment is like an Academy Award to me.\"<br />\nConcluding, Hoffman talked about his turn towards<br />\nviolence as a tactic. \"We used to be flower children, but<br />\nnow we've grown thorns. In order to survive, we must<br />\nlearn to fight. I'm for using molotov cocktails-better<br />\nliving through chemistry!\"<br />\nBut for the up-tight powers-that-be, all hope is not<br />\nlost.

The ban originally affected only<br />\ngrapes from the Guimarra Vineyards<br />\nCorporation, the largest producer of table grapes<br />\nin the United States. It later expanded to cover<br />\nall grapes because Guimarra began to sell its<br />\ngrapes through other growers.<br />\n<br />\nCesar Chavez, President of the United<br />\nFarm Workers Organizing Committee, will<br />\nbring his campaign fOr a nation-wide grape<br />\nboycott to the Hopkins campus today.<br />\nChavez is to speak in Shriver Hall at 2<br />\np.m. On Saturday he will lead a picketing<br />\nrally at the Ingleside Shopping Center in<br />\nCatonsville at 10 a.m.<br />\n<br />\nThe boycott has gradually become effective<br />\nthroughout the nation and in Great Britain and<br />\nScandinavian countries. Nationwide grape sales<br />\nwere off 12% in 1968 and at the start of this year<br />\nsales were down 15%. In June ten growers in<br />\nCalifornia agreed to talk with the union, but this<br />\ngroup is responsible for only 12% of the grapes<br />\nproduced in California.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Time Magazine, Chavez<br />\ncomes from a background of poverty and<br />\nprejudice that motivated him to lead<br />\nMexican-American grape pickers in an<br />\nattempt to move out of impoverishment.<br />\nChavez began his campaign in 1962 by<br />\n<br />\norganizing the United Farm Workers<br />\nAssociation (UFWA). Its first meeting, in<br />\n1962, drew 287 people - - in less than a<br />\nyear the organization had a membership<br />\nof 1,000.<br />\n<br />\nMany politicians have supported the efforts of<br />\nChavez, perhaps the first of these was the late<br />\nSenator Robert F. Kennedy. Others who have<br />\nbacked the workers are Senator Edward M.<br />\nKennedy, Senator Jacob Javits and Chicago's<br />\nMayor Richard Daley.<br />\n<br />\nPublishing Misfit<br />\n<br />\nChavez then initiated the publication<br />\nof a union newspaper - called El Malcriado<br />\n(The Misfit) whose circulation is now<br />\n18,000. In 1964 the union had grown<br />\nenough to challenge the authority of the<br />\ngrape growers. Teh NFWA took a grower<br />\nto court for paying less than the $1.25<br />\nminimum wage. The proceedings lasted<br />\nmonths but finally a small wage increase<br />\nwas won for the workers.<br />\nChavez has continually had difficulty in<br />\nmaintaining a consistent following. This is mainly<br />\ndue to the crushing financial need for the<br />\nMexican-American workers to stay employed.<br />\nAlso the grape workers are a highly transient<br />\ngroup and tend to be indifferent to the union.<br />\n<br />\nant MI<br />\n<br />\nHA SSV1D<br />\n<br />\nptios OS1?3<br />\n<br />\n816 \\Oil 01<br />\n(INV HDIVIHCI<br />\n<br />\nMIIII- OM<br />\n<br />\nSUBSCRIBE NOW. ..WE'LL BILL YOU<br />\ncopies of the 1970 HULLABALOO at S8.95 each.<br />\n<br />\nt=1<br />\n<br />\nINN<br />\n<br />\nIn Hawaii the Young Americans for Freedom<br />\norganized an airlift of the forbidden fruit from<br />\nthe mainland to give the islanders a better supply<br />\nof grapes.

Serena from the<br />\nAthletic Department, proved to be, by itself, a very dull meeting.<br />\nHowever, the poorly planned actions of Robert Bilgrave, Director of<br />\nStudent Affairs casts the meeting into a less harmonious light.<br />\nThe action I am referring to is Mr. Bilgrave's refusal to allow this<br />\nNews-Letter reporter to attend the meeting. Apart from the personal<br />\ninsult I felt, the entire issue of open meetings is renewed. Being<br />\nbanned from this or any other student-faculty-administration<br />\nmeeting is and was uncalled for.<br />\nIn this instance, Bilgrave has admitted that perhaps the<br />\nNews-Letter should have been allowed to attend. But my point is<br />\nhad the meeting been open in the first place there would be no need<br />\nfor apologies.<br />\nLimits Degree of Involvement<br />\nOn the one hand, the university encourages a student to get<br />\ninvolved but then it turns around and throws up barriers to limit the<br />\ndegree to which one can get involved. Put yourself in my position:<br />\nYOU ARE A SPORTS EDITOR BANNED.<br />\nSecondly, the News-Letter, especially in the Sports pages, is used<br />\nas a vehicle to reach the students with pertinent announcements<br />\n(i.e., team meetings and ticket announcements). After using the<br />\nNews-Letter in this sense, the university is very inconsistent in<br />\nexcluding students from the source of the news.<br />\nYOU ARE A SPORTS EDITOR BANNED.<br />\nOftentimes the News-Letter is accused of misrepresentation of<br />\nthe facts, pr, shall we say, yellow journalism. But, as Bilgrave's<br />\norigin:'.1 action shows, we are sometimes kept from getting a<br />\nfirst-hand accurate report.<br />\nWorthwhile Service<br />\nThe News-Letter, especially in the Sports Pages, provides a<br />\nworthwhile service to the Hopkins community. It is time the<br />\nuniversity recognized this. We are all part of the Hopkins family. We<br />\nhave a strong interest in Hopkins and in Hopkins Athletics or else we<br />\nwouldn't be here.<br />\nThe Sept 18th meeting did include students. Why was it so<br />\nessential to exclude the News-Letter?<br />\nYOU ARE A SPORTS EDITOR BANNED.<br />\nThe crux of the meeting was to find the cause of a<br />\nmisunderstanding between the Orientation Committee and the<br />\nAthletic Center over the concept of the Freshman picnic. The matter<br />\nin a nutshell boiled down to a lack of communication.<br />\nCenter of Fault<br />\nMarshall Turner took most of the wind out of the sails of the<br />\nOrientation Committee when he admitted that the center was<br />\ncompletely at fault for the lack of available equipment and partially<br />\nat fault for the lack of available facilities. However,in analysis, both<br />\nparties were to blame. To say that one was more at fault than the<br />\nother would be pure speculation.<br />\nOther aspects touched on in the meeting were work-study for<br />\nstudents at the gym and the possibility of an Advisory Committee to<br />\naid the Atheltic Department. According to Hal Thorne, Bilgrave's<br />\nIssistant, a joint memorandum of both the Orientation Committee<br />\nand the Office of Student Affairs should clarify the Orientation<br />\ndifficulties in the future and perhaps shed some light on the other<br />\ntopics of the Sept 18th meeting.<br />\nAt present some understanding has been reached between this<br />\nreporter and Bilgrave. Nevertheless, long after the particulars of this<br />\nmeeting are forgotten one line will remain<br />\nYOU- ARE A SPORTS EDITOR BANNED.<br />\n<br />\nFootball Line-up<br />\nThe probable starting line-up for<br />\ntommorrow's Varsity Football opener against<br />\nMuhlenberg is:<br />\nDEFENSE<br />\n<br />\nOFFENSE<br />\nTE<br />\nLT<br />\nLG<br />\nRG<br />\nRT<br />\nSE<br />\nQB<br />\nFB<br />\nTB<br />\nWB<br />\n<br />\nNo.87 Steve Latson<br />\n76 Mike Wilbanks<br />\n65 Dennis Lanahan<br />\n54 Gus Slotman<br />\n64 Tom Sawyer<br />\n78 Mike Malloy<br />\n82 Dave Pickall<br />\n12 Bob Pfeifer<br />\n34 Steve Hata<br />\n40 Paul Weiss<br />\n10 Charlie qoker,<br />\n<br />\nDT<br />\nLB<br />\nLB<br />\nLB<br />\nDB<br />\nDB<br />\nDB<br />\n17..c..,<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n:\u2022L'Jli<br />\nI<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n83 Doug Hein<br />\n74 Howard Weaver<br />\n75 Ken Brown<br />\n45 John Diorio<br />\n62 Jim Lotto<br />\n53 Chuck Pinsky<br />\n28 Rob Hacker<br />\n10 Charlie Coker<br />\n20 Bob Hyde<br />\n21 Henry Robey<br />\nsrt I ifilif.)111.1<br />\n1',,4 j)<br />\n<br />\nBy LEWIS GUTMAN<br />\nWith tommorrow starting Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference football, the Blue<br />\nJays will have a lot to think about. One<br />\nthing is last Saturday's loss to the<br />\nLebanon Valley Flying Dutchmen;<br />\nanother is the possible loss of Paul Weiss,<br />\nthe Jays' leading rusher last year and the<br />\nonly experienced running back.<br />\nThe Blue Jays will face Muhlenberg, one of<br />\nthe strongest contenders in the Conference. Last<br />\nyear, the Hopkins team narrowly defeated them,<br />\n30-28. Fourteen of Muldenberg's starters have<br />\nreturned from last year. Hopkins' 1968 team<br />\ngraduated last June with the exception of some<br />\nreserves and a few first stringers.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were plagued by inexperienced<br />\nplayers in their 37-7 loss to Lebanon Valley last<br />\nSaturday. Their play together was confused and<br />\nsisordered for football. Junior quarterback Bob<br />\nPfiefer spent most of the afternoon running with<br />\nthe ball either through the line on missed<br />\nhandoffs or around the end to escape Lebanon<br />\nValley's onrushing lineman. Running backs<br />\nHenry Robey and Steve Hata, while gaining 119<br />\nyards rushing, fumbled three times on hurried<br />\npitchouts by Pfiefer. One of those fumbles was<br />\nrecovered by Lebanon Valley and taken in, eight<br />\nplays later, for a touchdown.<br />\nThe defense had a worse time of it. The line<br />\ngot in only three times to dump Lebanon's<br />\nquarterback Robin Kbrnmeyer, who went back<br />\ninto the pocket to throw almost thirty times,<br />\ncompleting sixty percent of his passes for 158<br />\nyards and scrambling for 112 yards when his<br />\nreceivers weren't open. Kornmeyer, his running<br />\nback Tom Koons, who ran in three touchdowns,<br />\nand his receiver, Greg Teter, kept the Blue Jay<br />\nsecondary unorganized and ineffective.<br />\nDutchmen Score Five<br />\nThe Flying Dutchmen scored five touchdowns,<br />\nfour of them on the ground. The first score came<br />\nat the end of the first quafter after Kornmeyer<br />\nscrambled for 33 yards bringing the ball into<br />\nHonkins territory. Six plays later, Koons plunged<br />\n<br />\ninto the end zone from one yard out, giving the<br />\nFlying Dutchmen a 7-0 lead.<br />\nBut the Blue Jays rallied on their next set of<br />\ndowns. Steve Hata found a big hole off tackle<br />\nand ran downfield for a thirty yard gain. The<br />\nBlue Jay drive stalled and Charley Coker punted.<br />\nHis kick, a low line drive, hit on the ten yard line<br />\nand bounced all the way to the three, stopping<br />\ndead there. THe Blue Jay defense held tight for<br />\nthree downs forcing the Dutchmen to punt from<br />\ndeep inside their own territory. The Blue Jays<br />\ngot the ball first and ten on Lebanon Valley's 31<br />\nyard line. Bob Pfiefer connected with Senior end<br />\nSteve Latson for fourteen yards and a first down.<br />\nOn the next play, Pfiefer handed off to Steve<br />\nHata, who went straight up the middle and into<br />\nthe end zone untouched. After a successful<br />\nconversion, the score was tied.<br />\nDefense Breaks Down<br />\nAfter that, the Hopkins defense virtually<br />\nbroke down. Before the half was over, the<br />\nDutchmen scored three touchdowns, giving them<br />\na 30-7 lead. In the second quarter, the Blue Jay<br />\noffense controlled the ball for only nine downs.<br />\nThe ball was monopolized by the Dutchmen,<br />\nenroute to their 30-7 lead.<br />\nThe second half saw the ball being shifted<br />\nback and forth between both teams. With the<br />\nexception of a single Lebanon Valley<br />\ntouchdown,there was no scoring.<br />\nThe Blue Jay offense was generated by<br />\nquarterback Pfiefer, running backs Robey and<br />\nHata, end Dave Pickall, and flanker Charley<br />\nCoker. Pfiefer was under constant pressure from<br />\nLebanon's linemen, and the Hopkins offense<br />\nshowed this. Passes were hurried, handoffs were<br />\nmissed, and fumbles occurred. Once past the<br />\nlineman, however, the offense was effective.<br />\nDownfield blocking and the lack of penalities(32<br />\nyards in penalities compared to Lebanon Valley's<br />\n65)were two points in the Blue Jays' favor.<br />\nWith a week in between Lebanon Valley and<br />\nMuhlenberg in addition to the possible return of<br />\nPaul Weiss, there could be a big difference in the<br />\nBlue Jays.<br />\n<br />\nSports<br />\nBriefs<br />\nWrestling Meeting<br />\nThere will be a meeting of all<br />\nvarsity and freshman wrestling<br />\ncandidates on Tuesday,<br />\nSeptember 30, 7 p.m. in the<br />\nclassroom of the Athletic Center.<br />\nFaces in the Crowd<br />\nOn page 62 of last Sunday's<br />\nColts-Rams Program appears \"A<br />\nFace In The Crowd\".

What is known<br />\nis impressive.\" The gap between present<br />\nknowledge of the control of the<br />\nautonomic nervous system and the<br />\namazing achievements of the yoga<br />\nmaster is vast. Medical science until<br />\nrecently either marveled at the powers<br />\nof the Eastern mystics or dismissed the<br />\nevidence as not well-documented.<br />\nThis last claim is all too true. The<br />\nprobings of the curious scientist are<br />\nanathewa to truly religious.mystics, and<br />\neven now data drips in from researchers<br />\nin India very slowly. The best masters of<br />\nthe art of body control are completely<br />\ninacessable to western observers.<br />\nIn Dr. Engel's lab is a single bed<br />\nsurrounded by banks of electronic<br />\nmonitoring and control equipment. A<br />\npatient referred to him as a likely<br />\ncandidate receives careful instruction in<br />\nresearch methods and aims, the nature<br />\nof the heart and his own cardiac<br />\nproblem.<br />\nAt the foot of the bed is a panel with<br />\nthree colored lights. Electric impulses<br />\ndetected by electrodes taped to the<br />\npatient's body are transmitted to the<br />\nmaze of wires and solid state circuitry<br />\npacked eight feet high in metal cabinets.<br />\nEach subject's treatment is tailored to<br />\n<br />\nhis problem. If, for instance, the<br />\nproblem is one of irregular heart beat,<br />\nthe machine signals reinforcement with<br />\nthe appropriate light whenever the<br />\nrhythm is smooth. If, however, the<br />\nheart should decide to add an extra beat<br />\nout of time, a red light signals the<br />\nmachine's disappointment.<br />\nSessions are held twice a day, six<br />\ndays a week, and while the patient is in<br />\nhis room, his heart beat is monitored by<br />\na remote sensing device which transmits<br />\ninformation back to the lab, where it is<br />\nrecorded on magnetic tape. The tape is<br />\nlater analyzed by a computer to<br />\ndetermine whether there has been any<br />\nimprovement. In many cases, Engel has \u2022<br />\nbeen able to induce permanent<br />\nimprovement of the condition of an<br />\norganically-ill heart.<br />\nExperiments of this sort are<br />\nrelatively new. The first reports of<br />\nsuccess in autonomic control were<br />\nbrought to the attention of American<br />\ninvestigators in an abstract translated<br />\nfrom the Russian in the late 1950's. But<br />\nthe abstract did not contain the detailed<br />\nresults of the investigation, and it<br />\nreamined unnoticed until about 1961,<br />\nwhen Dr. Herbert Kimmel, then at the<br />\nUniversity of Florida, reported success<br />\n<br />\nin teaching subjects to control galvanic<br />\nskin response.<br />\nBy 1965, the natural course of heart<br />\nresearch, aided by the development of<br />\nnew electronic tools, led several<br />\ninvestigators into the field of autonomic<br />\ncontrol.<br />\n\"People are re-examining old<br />\nconcepts like mind-body dualism,\"<br />\nstated Dr. Engel. He explained that it is<br />\nno longer acceptable to talk about<br />\ntwo-sided concepts such as the<br />\nconscious as opposed to the<br />\nunconscious, or voluntary versus<br />\nautonomic nervous control. Rather,<br />\nthere is a continuum, a smooth path<br />\nfrom one end to the other.<br />\nEngel offered an analogy. There is a<br />\nkind of fish that inhabits the Amazon<br />\nriver from its headwaters down to the<br />\nsea. The fish interbreed with their<br />\nneighbors directly up and down stream<br />\nand in this way the gene plasm is<br />\ntransmitted from one end of the river to<br />\nthe other. Yet, if one of these animals is<br />\ntaken from his natural waters and<br />\nmoved down stream, instead of<br />\nbreeding, it will fight to the death with<br />\nanother of the same species.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nSex Ed. Sanction<br />\nCardinal Shehan, Archbishop of Baltimore, said this<br />\nweek that sex education has a place in the public<br />\nschools, but added that parents should have the right to<br />\ndecide whether their children should receive instruction<br />\nin the controversial subject.<br />\nIntroducing a formal statement on sex education<br />\nsigned by himself and the two other bishops with<br />\njurisdiction in Maryland, the Cardinal stated that, while<br />\nparents have primary responsibility for sex education,<br />\nthere is \"no reason\" for them \"not to share that<br />\nresponsibility with the schools.\"<br />\nHowever, Shehan added that parents have the right<br />\nand obligation to protest sex education programs that<br />\nviolate their \"moral and religious convictions,\" and<br />\nshould be allowed to remove their children from such<br />\nprograms. Presently, the State Board of Education<br />\nby-law on sex education does not give parents the<br />\nauthority to take their children out of class.<br />\n<br />\nBoycott Support<br />\nTwenty-four prominent professors have signed a<br />\nstatement supporting the student boycott of classes on<br />\nOct. 15 as a demonstration against the war in Vietnam.<br />\nAmong the signers are John Kenneth Galbraith, the<br />\neconomist and former ambassador to India, Noam<br />\nChomsky, the linguist from the Massachusetts Institute<br />\nof Technology and Hans Morgenthau, the political<br />\nscientist from the City University of New York.<br />\nThe professors contended that President Nixon's<br />\n\"gradual and partial displacement of American troops is<br />\nnot the substantive change in policy needed to end the<br />\nwar.\" Their statement claimed that the student<br />\nmoratorium would provide \"massive evidence\" that \"the<br />\nmajority of Americans recognize the senselessness of<br />\nVietnam and desire an end to that war.\"<br />\nSam Brown, one of the organizers of the student<br />\nboycott, said in an interview that support for the protest<br />\nhad \"mushroomed\" since President Nixon's<br />\nannouncements last week of the withdrawal of 35,000<br />\ntroops from Vietnam and a two-month suspension of the<br />\ndraft. Declared Mr. Brown,\"The people can see that this<br />\ntype of action is plainly a fraud.\"<br />\n<br />\nNew Ivy Look<br />\nDartmouth freshmen may have a new look this year<br />\nas the school, which has graduated only 150 blacks in its<br />\nthis fall,<br />\n200 year history, admitted 90 Negroes<br />\ncompared to last year's record-breaking thirty.<br />\nPreviously the administration has held the standard<br />\nposition that they \"would love to take more, but there<br />\njust aren't enough qualified blacks,\" However, black<br />\nstudents convinced the administration last year to give<br />\nthem some money and they would find the students.<br />\nOut of 230 black applicants, 130 were accepted and<br />\n0 decided to attend Dartmouth this fall. Unlike<br />\n<br />\nprevious years, at least half of these students came from<br />\npoor families.<br />\nIn order to accommodate the freshmen with poorer<br />\nacademic backgrounds, several departments have made<br />\nmajor changes in their course offerings. This year the<br />\nEnglish Department offered a special freshman course<br />\ntaught by an expert in remedial writing. Also a math<br />\ncourse below the level of calculus was introduced to<br />\naccomodate black entrants.<br />\nOther schools have also increased the number of<br />\nblack students admitted this fall. Harvard has 95 Negro<br />\nfreshmen this year (compared to 40 in 1966) Brown has<br />\n77 (eight in 1966) Weslyan, 51(30 in 1966)and Yale 96<br />\n(31 in 1966).<br />\n<br />\nAfro Studies<br />\nAn analysis of \"the black revolution\" is one of the<br />\nfifteen courses offered this semester at Harvard by the<br />\ndepartment of Afro- American studies established by the<br />\nuniversity last April.<br />\nThe new curriculum includes studies on slavery,<br />\nAfrican and Western Hemisphere history and black<br />\nexperiences in labor, politics, and the arts. An<br />\nIntroduction to Black Civilization will survey African<br />\nhistory from 800 B.C. to 1591 A.D., while the origins of<br />\nslavery as a social institution will be explored in another<br />\ncourse.<br />\nOn April 22, Harvards's Faculty of Arts and Sciences<br />\nmade the black studies program a`full interdisciplinary<br />\ndepartment and allowed students to take part in<br />\ndecisions formulating the department's course work. In a<br />\n31-page report announcing the new courses, a committee<br />\nof the Afro-American studies department also proposed<br />\nthe creation of a W. E. B. DuBois Institute for<br />\nAfro-American Research.<br />\nDr. Ewart Guinier, who left Harvard College during<br />\nthe Depression, was selected chairman of the new<br />\ndepartment. Eight other faculty members, who,like Dr.<br />\nGuinier, are black, were appointed to the department<br />\nthis summer.<br />\n<br />\n\"We Want Life\"<br />\nThe newest and most popular student group at New<br />\nYork University is a party-throwing organization of<br />\nhedonists who are trying to create an atmosphere similar<br />\nto that of the recent Woodstock music festival.<br />\nFormed last March as a small group to protest<br />\novercrowding in a psychology class, the Transcendental<br />\nStudents went on a stage of semi-political \"freak-outs\"<br />\nin vacant classrooms, study halls, and a former<br />\nrestaurant. The freak-outs were billed as attempts to<br />\n\"make N.Y.U. livable.\" They usually featured wine,<br />\nmarijuana, movies, political satire, acid-rock and often<br />\nthe New York City Police Department, called in to end<br />\nthe festivities.<br />\nEven the N.Y.U. administration has acknowledged<br />\nthe group's incluence. This term the administration<br />\nallocated $5,000 for the group to renovate Harouts, a<br />\nformer Greek restaurant and popular student gathering<br />\nplace.<br />\nIn spite of their outward appearance, Transcendental<br />\nStudents claim that they are a radical political<br />\norganization. When asked what they wanted to make of<br />\n<br />\nsociety, one member explained, \"We want a society<br />\nwhere you can smoke grass and drop acid and have a<br />\nplace like Harouts. We want a revolution that will see<br />\nDick Nixon out of the White House and people living<br />\nthere who will paint it different colors and invite people<br />\nto camp on the lawn--we want life.\"<br />\n<br />\nMedical Care<br />\nBaltimore's black medical society, in cooperation<br />\nwith community groups, is drawing up plans to provide<br />\ncomprehensive medical care for between 30,000 and<br />\n50,000 inner-city residents. Louis L. Randall, president<br />\nof the 85-member group known as the Monumental City<br />\nMedical Society, said, \"We would like to see things<br />\norganized within six months and certainly in action<br />\nwithin twelve to eighteen months.\" As outlined by Dr.<br />\nRandall, the plan envisioned a co-operative effort among<br />\nhospitals, clinics and individual doctors to provide<br />\ntop-quality care to persons on Medicaid and those<br />\nmedically indigent.<br />\n_ There is currently a \"health crisis\" in Baltimore<br />\ncaused by a shortage of Negro physicians and<br />\naccentuated by cutbacks in federal health funds and<br />\ntardy payments by the state under the Medicaid<br />\nprogram, Randall explained. Only two percent of the<br />\ncity's physicians are black, Dr. Randall also noted, and<br />\nmany tend to \"cluster\" their practices. About<br />\none-fourth of these doctors are 60 years old or older,<br />\nand many are specialists as opposed to general<br />\npractitioners.<br />\n<br />\nEveryone Chided<br />\nThe university, its faculty, and its students were all<br />\nberated in three lectures given this week by the<br />\nChancellor of the State University of New York, Dr.<br />\nSamuel B. Gould.<br />\nStating, \"It is not the student who is alienated today,<br />\nit is the college and university, \"Dr. Gould charged<br />\nAmerica's educational institutions with failing to adapt<br />\nto the times and ignoring their responsibilities to<br />\nstudents and to the outside community.<br />\nGould also criticized the methods of student<br />\nprotesters and their tendency to ignore the goals of their<br />\nactions. \"Campus agitators are rarely, if ever, students or<br />\nfaculty from the scientific disciplines; they tend to come<br />\nout of the social sciences, which are relatively inexact in<br />\ntheir researches, and the humanities, which are and<br />\nshould be occupied with unanswerable questions,\" he<br />\nnoted. \"Students should not and cannot come to the<br />\nuniversity with the expectation that they are going to<br />\nrun it any more than they should enter a course of study<br />\nwith the presupposition that they already know all the<br />\nprofessor has to foffer them.\"<br />\nIn the future, the chancellor envisioned vast<br />\n\"communiversities\" that would combine schools on<br />\nevery level from elementary to post-graduate, as well as<br />\nmuseums, libraries, theaters, art galleries, TV and radio<br />\nstations, newspapers and hospitals.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "Book Center Gets Investigated p.<br /><br />\nNews Letter<br />\nthe johns hopkins universi<br />\nVOL.

Dating,<br />\nwhich is the dominant social activity at<br />\nHopkins, is rare at black shcools. \"Guys<br />\nand girls at black schools just get<br />\ntogether all the time to have parties, go<br />\nto the movies, and have a good time,\" as<br />\na black junior put it.<br />\nWhile several black freshmen were<br />\nbitter about the scarcity of black girls at<br />\ntraditional Hopkins dating sources,<br />\nothers were confident that they could<br />\n\"get together and create a black social<br />\nlife.\"<br />\nRobert Owens, newly appointed<br />\nAssistant Director of Admissions, felt<br />\nthat the black freshmen would be able<br />\nto do this. \"They're a good, close group<br />\nof guys,\" he said, \"who've gone out of<br />\ntheir way to meet and help each other<br />\nout.

His<br />\nrole at Hopkins will be to attract<br />\nqualified black students to Hopkins and<br />\naid those here in any way he can.<br />\nA key factor in attracting black<br />\nstudents is the kind of feedback which<br />\ncomes from Negroes enrolled at<br />\nHopkins; until there is a sizable black<br />\ncommunity at Hopkins, things will bc<br />\ndifficult for black students here now.<br />\nOwens observed. This constitutes a<br />\ncircle that he feels he must deal with in<br />\norder to do his job effectively.<br />\nLast Spring a committee was formed<br />\nand discussions were held concerning<br />\nthe development of a remedial program<br />\nwith which to qualify economically and<br />\nacademically disadvantaged black<br />\nyouths for Hopkins. According to Allen<br />\nKimball, Dean of Arts and Sciences, the<br />\nplan was never carried through because<br />\n'you simply can't take a person whate<br />\nSAT scores are way below Hopkins'<br />\nnormal range and suddenly bring his<br />\nlevel way up.\"<br />\nEducation no Slaughter<br />\nOwens agreed that such a remedial<br />\nprogram would be impractical. \"We<br />\nwant students to come here for an<br />\neducation,\" he said, \"not to be<br />\nacademically , slaughtered.\" He felt that<br />\nhis job is to let black students know<br />\nthat Hopkins is available if they can<br />\nqualify.<br />\nSeveral black students observed that<br />\nguidance counselors tend to advise<br />\nstudents at predominantly black 'high<br />\nschools against coming to Hopkins.<br />\nOwens expressed the intention of<br />\nspeaking with teachers, counselors, and<br />\nstudents form a wide variety of schools<br />\nto counteract this. He noted that several<br />\nblack freshmen have volunteered to help<br />\nhim do this.<br />\nPart of Hopkins' difficulty in<br />\nattracting black students stems from<br />\nhaving standards comparable to ivy<br />\nleague schools without as attractive a<br />\nreputation. \"Any black student who<br />\nqualifies for Hopkins,\" explained senior<br />\nCharley Wood, \"will also qualify for<br />\nHarvard, Cornell, Princeton, and so<br />\nforth. Unless he's a pre-med, Hopkins'<br />\nimage doesn't really stick.\"<br />\nIn the meantime Hopkins is taking<br />\nno specific action to promote the<br />\neducation of black people. When the<br />\nremedial program was discarded last<br />\nSpring, according to Dean Kimball, it<br />\nwas decided that Hopkins could best<br />\nserve the black community by taking a<br />\nleadership role in establishing<br />\nmechanisms to identify black students<br />\nof the Baltimore-Washington area<br />\ncapable of going to college and helping<br />\nthem 'get into some scho.ong yet,<br />\nhowever, has been done to 14is eand<br />\nexplained Kimball.<br />\nar .<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE Sept. 26, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nAirlines Expected to Raise Youth Fares by 10%<br />\nBy RICK FITCH<br />\n(CPS) Airline youth fares will continue, but<br />\nnot at the current half-price discount.<br />\nThe five-man Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB)<br />\ndecided here this month that while the fares,<br />\nwhich enable persons aged 12-22 to fly standby<br />\nat low cost, were fair in principle, airlines should<br />\nbe allowed to raise them to 60 per cent of the<br />\nregular coach fare.<br />\nthe reason: steep wage settlements, more expensive<br />\nfuel, and higher landing fees have lowered airline profits<br />\nexcessively, according to the CAB,and price increases in<br />\nboth regualr and promotional discounts are necessary to<br />\nincrease revenue. The major air carriers offering special<br />\nyouth fares - - American, Continental, Northwest, TWA,<br />\nUnited, Eastern, and Western - - are expected to take<br />\nadvantage of the CAB ruling and raise their prices. The<br />\nnew rates will take effect October 1.<br />\nA CAB spokesman said further hearings will be held<br />\non the \"economics\" of the discount rate as soon as a<br /><br />\ncourt case brought by Trailways Bus Systems against the<br />\nCAB in settled. Trailways contends that it is<br />\ndiscriminatory for there to be any discount for youth at<br />\nall, since adults must pay full fare.<br />\nThe youth fare issue was forced to a head last<br />\nJanuary when several bus companies, all of which had<br />\nlost business to the airlines because of the fares, filed<br />\nsuit to make the CAB listen to their arguments that the<br />\ndiscounts were illegal.<br />\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans,<br />\nagreeing with some of the arguments, ordered the CAB<br />\nto investigate. CAB examiner Arthur S. Present<br />\nsubsequently found the fares to be \"unjustly<br />\ndiscriminatory\" and in violaltion of the Federal Aviation<br />\nAct of 1958.<br />\nCAB Deluged<br />\nPresent recommended that the fares be abolished, but<br />\nthe CAB delayed action when protests were registered<br />\nby the National Student Association, the Campus<br />\nAmericans for Democratic Action, the National Student<br />\nMarketing Corporation, and many students and parents<br />\nwho deluged CAB offices with letters. Three measures<br /><br />\nwere introduced in Congress in support of the low-cost<br />\nyouth fares.<br />\nIn its recent decision, the CAB concluded, contrary<br />\nto Present's earlier findings, that the fares were not<br />\ndiscriminatory, but benefited all travelers. By<br />\nengendering development of a new market, they \"have<br />\ncontributed sizeably to making modern equipment and<br />\nconvenient schedules more broadly available,\" the CAB<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"It is clear that the youth standby fares have<br />\ngenerated a significant amount of new traffic,\" it said.<br />\n\"The 12-22 year age groups are more responsive to price<br />\nthan is the market as a whole. Moreover, in addition to<br />\nthe short-run generative a significant amount of new<br />\ntraffic,\" it said. \"The 12-22 year age groups are more<br />\nresponsive to price than is the market as a whole.<br />\nMoreover, in addition to the short-run generative effect<br />\nof youth fares, the long-term traffic impact is also<br />\nsignificant.

He was told at<br />\nthat time that his requires would have<br />\nto be put off until this year's budget<br />\nwas being formulated.<br />\nDr. Allyn Kimball, Dean of the<br />\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences, stated<br />\nthat last year's budget, while already<br />\napproved, presently awaits sufficient<br />\nfunding.\"The snack bar and the student<br /><br />\n\"To go FM, the station will only need twenty-four thousand dollars.

Were WJHU to<br />\nswitch to FM programming, Bilgrave<br />\nexplained, \"it ceases to be a student<br />\nactivity at Homewood and becomes a<br />\nvoice of the University.\" The station<br />\ncannot, therefore, lapse into an irregular<br />\npattern or inconsistent quality of<br />\nprogramming.<br />\nDean Kimball also noted that the<br />\nactivity cannot afford to become<br />\ninactive in future years. \"When you go<br />\ninto what goes beyond the Homewood<br />\ncommunity you must have continuity<br />\nfrom year to year.\" Bilgrave noted that,<br />\nin the past years, an activity of<br />\nexceptional quality one year can often<br />\ncompletely fall apart the following year<br />\ndue to regular staff changes. One<br />\npossible solution to these problems is<br />\nfor the University to provide a regular<br />\nUniversity official who can oversee the<br />\nstation from year to year. \"Our only<br />\nconcern is quality, not censorship,\"<br />\nstated Kimball.<br />\nAt present there are no qualified<br />\nprofessors or administrative officals who<br />\nhave the time to devote to such a<br />\nproject. Kimball did note, however, that<br />\nthat the University is presently trying to<br />\nincrease the staff of the Office of Public<br />\nRelations. \"Perhaps the man taking that<br />\npost will have the qualifications,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nKimball did admit that the switch<br />\nfrom AM to FM is inevitable. \"The only<br />\nquestion is when. At present the<br />\nfinancial outlook (of the University) is<br />\nnot very rosy but at no other time has<br />\nthere been this interest in the radio<br />\nstation and I think it is important.\"<br />\n24 Hour Day<br />\nThompson has specific plans for the<br />\neventual conversion of the station to<br />\nFM.

Walker, a<br />\nformer custodian at Hopkins who left<br />\nsoon after the first meeting of the<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nDriving Force<br />\nMr. Walker was the driving force<br />\nbehind the committee, and when he left<br />\nthe employ of the University, there was<br />\nno one with the leadership capabilities<br />\nto take over as acting head of the<br />\ncommittee. Thus, the committee has<br />\nnot been able to accomplish its ends.<br />\nMr. Wesley Taylor, former plant<br />\nmanager at Hopkins, said of Walker,<br />\nthat he was, \"very reasonable\", and<br />\n\"anxious to improve as much as possible<br />\nthe lot of all the workers\" . . . .

At the<br />\ntime it was decried by Walker as not<br />\nbeing a living wage. Since that time,<br />\nthere have been two increases in the<br />\nwages paid by the University. The first<br />\nincrease came on February 3rd, and<br />\nraised the starting wage of Hopkins<br />\nemployees to $1.60 per hour. On<br />\nSeptember 1st, the wage for employees<br />\nstarting at Hopkins was increased to<br />\n$1.80 per hour. Yet many workers still<br />\ncomplain that it is \"not a living wage\".<br />\nWishing to remain anonymous,<br />\n\"because this could cause a little<br />\ndisturbance upstairs\", one employee<br />\nstated, \"Let's face it. It's not a living<br />\nwage with the rise in the cost of living<br />\nand all.\"<br />\nHowever, Mr. George], a supervisor in<br />\nWhitehead Hall, stated that the new<br />\nstarting wage of $1.80 per hour was a<br /><br />\n\"fair wage\" considering that other jobs<br />\nof this sort in Baltimore pay the same<br />\nstarting wage.<br />\nAnother employee grievance is that<br />\na fter training an employee, the<br />\nUniversity does not increase wages<br />\nproportionate to the amount of time an<br />\nemployee has worked for the,<br />\nUniversity. This charge was denied by<br />\nMr. George] who said that every six<br />\nmonths the employees are eligible for<br />\npay increases if they are recommended<br />\nby the supervisor. ;Mr. Georgel also<br />\nnoted that there is a new shift<br />\ndifferential which provides for an 8c per<br />\nhour increase for those who work the<br />\n3:00 p.m. - 11:39 p.m. shift and a 12c<br />\nper hour increase for those who work<br />\nthe 11:30 p.m. - 8:00 a.m. shift.<br />\nThis system does not seem to work<br />\nhowever, judging from the large number<br />\nof turnovers in university hourly<br />\nemployees.<br />\nAnother of last year's grievances,<br />\nthat there were no black supervisors, has<br />\nyet to be resolved.<br />\nUnion Desired<br />\nThe University claims to be always<br />\nacting to find answers to employee<br />\ngrievances.

A major danger in<br />\nthis approach lies in the fact that when<br />\nthe original purposes and membership<br />\nof established representative groups are<br />\naltered, the traditional members are, in<br />\nsome instances, unsympathetic. Further,<br />\nwhen meetings are merely opened to<br />\nallow only observers, communication is<br />\nsuppressed, or worse, distorted.<br />\nI propose, therefore, that a<br />\nUniversity Senate be constituted at The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University - - a body<br />\nwhose aim shall be to consider and<br />\ndiscuss all questions pertaining to the<br />\nacademic and non-academic activities of<br />\nour institution. As in the case of other<br />\nspecial groups, this body should report<br />\nand make its recommendations directly<br />\nto the president of the University. Most<br />\nquestions of importance to the<br />\nacademic community should appear<br />\nbefore this group. However,<br />\npromotions, appointments, and tenure<br />\nquestions for faculty members would<br />\nremaind the responsibility of the<br />\nAcademic Council.<br />\nTo obtain a fair representation of<br />\nfaculty and students, I recommend that<br />\nthe group be composed of 50 percent<br />\nfaculty and 50 percent students, plus<br />\nthe president of the University, the vice<br />\npresident, the deans and associate deans.<br />\nA viable number should be of the order<br />\nof fifty people. The student<br />\nrepresentation could be divided equally<br />\nbetween undergraduate and graduate<br />\nrepresentatives. Because there are six<br />\nmajor academic groups on campus, a<br />\nconvenient method for obtaining a wide<br />\nparticipation of faculty whould be to<br />\nhave four 'faculty members elected from<br />\neach group (i.e., Humanities, Social<br />\nSciences, Biological Sciences, Physical<br />\nSciences, Engineering Sciences, and<br />\nEarth and Planetary Sciences.) With<br />\nfour elected members from each of six<br /><br />\ngroups, the faculty representation<br />\nwould amount to twenty-four. Through<br />\nthe leadership of the Student Council,<br />\nthe undergraduates should then elect<br />\ntwelve representatives, and the graduate<br />\nstudent governing board would in the<br />\nsame manner supervise the election of<br />\ntwelve representatives. I strongly<br />\nrecommend that all elections be popular<br />\nwithin a subdivision. This is to say that<br />\nthe four faculty members from a given<br />\ngroup; the undergraduate<br />\nrepresentatives would then be elected<br />\nby a popular vote of all the<br />\nundergraduates. Graduate students, like<br />\nfaculty, might be selected from the six<br />\ngroups, with two members selected<br />\nfrom each.<br />\nOnce the membership is established,<br />\nthe charge to the Senate is of vital<br />\nimportance. If this is to be an<br />\nauthoritative body, it must be in a<br />\nposition to consider major questions<br />\nconcerning the non-academic and the<br />\nacademic enterprise, excluding those of<br />\npromotions and appointments. Besides<br />\nthe regular business which is now<br />\nbrought before such groups as the<br />\nGeneral Assembly, this body could have<br />\nthe opportunity to view questions<br />\nwhich at the present time have no<br />\nforum where they can be aired. Such<br />\nproblems as student housing, student<br />\nstipends, and student activities cannot<br />\nbe brought before the general academic<br />\ncommunity at the present: a Senate<br />\nwould provide a means for dealing with<br />\nsuch questions.<br />\nThe Senate should establish its own<br />\nstanding committees. In fact, most of<br />\nthe standing committees of the<br />\nUniversity except those of the academic<br />\ncouncil should report to a Senate once<br />\nit has been constituted. In this manner,<br />\nmuch of the confusion and failure to<br />\n\u2022communicate can be avoided.<br />\nA proposal such as that outlined here<br />\nwill not satisfy all interested parties.<br />\nHowever, no proposal will be found<br />\nwhich is acceptable to all. To be both<br />\nfair and realistic, each participant must<br />\nconcede somewhat. I believe that the<br />\ndistribution of representatives and the<br />\ncharge to a Senate are the most<br />\nfundamental problems. If the balance of<br />\ninterest is shifted too far in favor of any<br />\none group, an assembly such as that<br />\nproposed will not be viable.

He insisted that<br />\na major precendent would follow the<br />\napproval of open Assembly meetings.<br />\n\"This is a sweeping opening,\" he<br />\ndeclared, \"and I don't think we know<br />\nwhat we're getting into.\"<br />\nThe majority of the faculty, though,<br />\nrejected these views. Stated Dr. John<br />\nWhite, head of the history of art<br />\ndepartment, \"I think that if we are<br />\ngoing to exclude undergraduates it<br />\nshould be done openly and they should<br />\nknow the reasons behind the issue.\" He<br />\ncalled the motion for a private meeting<br />\n\"a delaying tactic.\"<br />\nDr. Tim Smith, education<br />\ndepartment chairman, also urged the<br />\nfaculty to support open attendance.<br />\n\"The presence of students when the<br />\nfaculty is making decisions seem no<br />\nthreat at all to me,\" he asserted.<br />\n\"Democratic countries have always had<br />\nopen meetings for the health of the<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nThe motion to delay the meeting was<br />\nsoundly defeated. A resolution by Dr.<br />\nSmith followed. It proposed opening<br />\nthe Assembly meetings to everyone<br />\ninside and outside the university, and it<br />\nwas also rejected by the faculty.

First,<br />\nhe predicted that no one would be<br />\nsatisifed with the fifty-fifty arrangement<br />\nhe had drawn up to balance the power<br />\nof students and faculty. In the proposal,<br />\nhe noted this probability, saying it<br />\nwould, \"not satisfy all interested<br />\nparties.\"<br />\nHe told the NEWS-LETTER that he<br />\n\"wrangled with the problem\" of<br />\ndistribution of seats for a long time<br />\nbefore he came up with the fifty-fifty<br />\nplan. He said that in order to achieve a<br />\nsolution to this problem \"everybody<br />\nmust be realistic,\" and he warned in the<br />\nproposal that \"each party must concede<br />\nsomewhat.\"<br />\nOwen stated that he expected<br />\nobjections from both students and<br />\nfaculty on the distribution of seats.<br />\nAlthough many faculty members<br />\nexpressed their support of the senate<br />\nproposal in the abstract, most had not<br />\nseen Owen's draft of the proposal and<br />\nrefused to comment on distribution of<br />\nseats and other specifics which it<br />\ncontained.<br />\n\u2022 The second objection to the plan<br />\nwhich- -Owen- \u2022 expects. -would. - come-<br /><br />\nprimarily from the faculty. Since the<br />\nfaculty has wielded almost absolute<br />\npower at Hopkins, it would have to<br />\nyield certain of its prerogatives if<br />\nstudents were granted a voice in the<br />\ndecision-making process.<br />\nThis would mean that the Academic<br />\nCouncil, now the body which has final<br />\nsay for most practical purposes would<br />\nno longer recommend directly to<br />\nPresident Gordon on most subjects. The<br />\nCouncil's recommendations would go to<br />\nthe Senate and if passed, then travel to<br />\nthe President's office.<br />\nHowever, in his proposal, Owen<br />\nreserves faculty appointments,<br />\npromotions and questions of tenure for<br />\nthe exclusvie control and consideration<br />\nof the faculty. This has long been one of<br />\nthe major arguments for refusing<br />\nstudents seats on the Academic Council.<br />\nFaculty members nearly unanimously<br />\nreject the idea that students consider<br />\nthese questions and most people<br />\ncontacted felt that had these matters<br />\nnot been reserved for the faculty, the<br />\nproposal would have no chance of<br />\npassage.<br />\nOwen believes that students have had<br />\ndifficulty obtaining a voice in the<br />\ndecision making process largely because<br />\nof tradition and not because faculty<br />\nmembers- - objected - -or principle to-<br /><br />\nstudents having that voice.<br />\nHe begins his proposal by explaining<br />\nthe difficulties inherent in amending<br />\nexisitng procedures and groups. \"A<br />\nmajor danger in this approach,\" the<br />\nproposal reads, \"lies in the fact that<br />\nwhen the original purposes and<br />\nmembership of established<br />\nrepresentative groups are altered, the<br />\ntraditional members are, in some<br />\ninstances, unsympathetic,\"<br />\nFor this reason, it is generally<br />\nbelieved that this type of proposal has a<br />\nmuch greater chance of passage than<br />\nwould a proposal to seat students on<br />\nsuch traditional bodies as the Academic<br />\nCouncil. Owen averred that he was<br />\npersonally fond of tradition, but for<br />\npragmatic reasons felt that it must be<br />\noverridden in . this case. \"Hell, if<br />\ntradition is causing half of the trouble,<br />\nlet's change the tradition.\"<br />\nOwen felt that he must be<br />\n\"extremely careful\" in his remarks<br />\nabout the proposal and his ideas for the<br />\nsenate. He and others who supported<br />\nthe idea are reluctant to discuss the<br />\nproposal's ramifications or the response<br />\nwhich they expect for fear of reducing<br />\nthe chances for passage.<br />\nHis aim is to \"get the ball rolling,\"<br />\nand hc.believes that once other people<br /><br />\nbegin to support the idea and work for<br />\nits implementation he \"won't be<br />\nneeded.\"<br />\nThe proposal, if approved by the<br />\nAcademic Council, would have to be<br />\napproved by Dr. Gordon as well. Owen<br />\nsaid that he discussed the idea with Dr.<br />\nGordon and others last June and that<br />\nDr. Gordon's reaction was \"generally<br />\nfavorable.\"<br />\nApparently, talk of a university<br />\nsenate or another body which would<br />\nalter the system of governance at<br />\nHopkins has been discussed among the<br />\nfaculty and administration for some<br />\ntime now. Dean Strider said that he had<br />\ndiscussed this and other ideas with<br />\nmany people other than Owen. \"We've<br />\nbeen rolling the idea around,\" he said.<br />\nThe first time the idea was expressed<br />\npublicly was at the Faculty General<br />\nAssembly last Friday when Owen stood<br />\nand recommended that such a senate be<br />\nestablished. Owen said he believed that<br />\nthe argument on whether to hold open<br />\nmeetings missed the point.<br />\nIn the proposal, he claimed that<br />\nobservers in meetings hindered<br />\ncommunication. In addition, he said, \"If<br />\nI were called into a meeting and told,<br />\n'you can listen but you can't say<br />\nanthing,'<br />\n,I'd tend to get angry.\"<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE Sept. 26,1969<br /><br />\nJIrDIPWS<br />\neditors-in-chief:<br />\nbusiness managers:<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\n/Gem<br />\nRichard B. Cramer, Peter Harnik<br />\nGeorge Johnston, Kevin Kresock<br /><br />\nFor The University Senate<br />\nDr. Owen's proposal for a faculty-student senate at Hopkins is one of<br />\nthe most encouraging things to appear in the last several years. As Dr.<br />\nOwen freely admits, the idea itself is not astounding. Many other schools<br />\nhave instituted similar systems with good results. What is astounding is<br />\nthat something like this is being proposed for the Hopkins campus where<br />\nthe faculty has always been in control and has been hypersensitive to any<br />\nattempt to decrease that control.<br />\nThe fact is that with the establishment of a Senate, the Academic<br />\nCouncil will be relegated to the status of the Student Council and the<br />\nGraduate Advisory Committee. All three will be advisory bodies to the<br />\nmain Senate. Unless the members of the faculty who are responding<br />\nfavorably to the idea of a university senate are unaware of that fact, this<br />\nrepresents a dramatic change in attitude.<br />\nGiving students a true voice in the affairs of the university also<br />\nrepresents a dramatic shift in attitude for the faculty. Perhaps all that was<br />\nholding back the faculty from giving in on this point was its objections to<br />\nhaving students on the Academic Council. In terms of tradition and<br />\naesthetics it would have been an abortion. .So the only hope was an<br />\norganization other than the Academic Council.

That<br />\nmay not be all good but the situation is as inevitable as it<br />\nis comical. For the powers that be have exhausted every<br />\npossible course of action in dealing with drug use, except<br />\nthe most obvious, rational course, that of acceptance. A<br />\nbrief history then, to show how the proverbial monkey,<br />\npounding on his proverbial typewriter will in the very<br />\nnear future present us with a letter-perfect dictionary:<br />\nProblems in the modern world are synthesized in<br />\nresponse to social needs. A chemical company finding<br />\nitself with a lot of sweet smelling goo will not go sniffing<br />\naround body cavities looking for a smelly spot. Instead,<br />\nas Galbraith noted in<br />\nThe New Industrial State,<br />\nit will \"create a demand.\" In this case, it will find a<br />\nlikely location, convince the consumer that what he has<br />\nthere is a problem spot and offer the product as a<br />\nsolution to the problem which, one advertising campaign<br />\nago, did not exist.<br />\nThe drug \"problem\" was created in just such a<br />\nmanner. In the mid 1930's, the Federal Government was<br />\nstuck with a supply of surplus solutions in the form of<br />\nFederal Agents idled by the repeal of prohibition. At the<br />\nsame time, two widely polarized groups were stuck with<br />\ntheir own peculiar types of surplus solutions looking for<br />\na problem. Organized crime had an intricate and<br />\nwell-polished blackmarket and smuggling apparatus<br />\noriginally designed for bootlegging, while organized<br />\nconservatism and the professional morality pushers had a<br />\nphilosophy of abstention that had been frustrated and<br />\nnegated by the failure of prohibition.<br />\nA fourth group, the newly revitalized liquor lobby,<br />\nprovided a catalyst for the marijuana prohibition by<br />\nputting its weight behind the effort that would result in<br />\na near monoply for its product.<br />\nAll the solutions went on to create their problem.<br />\nThe Feds coagulated around the infant(b. 1930) Federal<br />\nBureau of Narcotics which sold the new prohibition with<br />\nthe kind of scare tactics that were a joke to rational,<br />\nmuch less knowlegable, minds. The upper crust<br />\nLiterary Digest<br />\nset, happy to find something to<br /><br />\n\"X As Sung to the Tune of:<br />\n\"Honolulu Lulu\"<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nbanish, echoed this \"killer weed\" propaganda. (By the<br />\nby, if you've ever wondered why your parents feel the<br />\nway they do about drugs, ask them about the kind of<br />\nthings they were told in the '30's.)<br />\nThe Mafia, and the smaller units of organized crime<br />\nfound themselves, once again, in business. True, the<br />\nMarijuana Tax Act of 1937 was not as strong a subsidy<br />\nof crime as was the Volstead Act. But by taking<br />\nsomething that had become an established product (if<br />\nfor only a small minority) and illegalizing it, the<br />\ngovernment was creating the base of a criminal market<br />\nand was, in fact, giving that market a bit of a push with<br />\nits negative publicity (and what does a criminal market<br />\nuse for advertising? The law's negative publicity).<br />\nThere being an awful lot of people in the 1930's, that<br />\ngolden era of facism, who simply would not do what the<br />\ngovernment forbade, a large part of the mind-softening<br />\nmarket was safely in the hands of the liquor industry.<br />\nThe industry liked it that way. Indeed, when the war<br />\nyears created an enormous demand for chemical<br />\nrelaxation it was the alcohol people who reaped the<br />\nlion's share of the profits as well as the priceless<br />\nopportunity to condition an entire generation to the<br />\nfavorable acceptance of their wares. Daddy, who had<br />\nbeen scarred shittless about drugs by pre-war<br />\npropaganda, was conditioned to the warm comfort of<br />\nthat handy flask he carried for the duration.<br />\nSo the tight coalition continued through the forties<br />\nand fifties, all the diverse elements of society happily<br />\nand profitably solving the problem they had created.<br />\nThere had been some trouble when the original problem<br />\nof the \"killer weed\" had been challenged by those (i.e.<br />\nMayor's<br />\nThe<br />\nMarijuana<br />\nCommittee<br />\non<br />\nReport , New York, 1944) who were in prossession of<br />\nenough medical statistics and raw courage to protest that<br />\nit just wasn't so, that the big deadly boogie man had no<br />\nclothes. But this problem of the problem had been<br />\nsolved by modifying the myth to the allegation that<br />\nmarijuana and hashish inevitably led to heroin addiction.<br />\nThis new lie was enough to push the coalition to its<br />\napex, the passage of the newer, tou4her 1956 Narcotic<br />\nControl Act, the Magna Carta of dope persecution.<br />\nWhat then has happened in the 1960's to weaken the<br />\ncoalition? First, as a result of both an increasing liberal<br />\ntrend in government, as well as an increasing<br />\ndisillusionment with government, the influence and<br />\nprestige of repressive agencies like the FNB suffered (at<br /><br />\nleast in the earlier part of the decade). As a result of this<br />\nweakening of mindless awe toward the government,<br />\nmore and more individuals became receptive to the idea<br />\nof defying govenrment when government stood between<br />\nthem and their personal desires and social beliefs (i.e. the<br />\ncivil rights drives).<br />\nThe increase in the marijuana market is explained by<br />\nthree additional factors: First, the increase in<br />\nimportance and influence of those groups who had been<br />\nmost familiar with the drug all along\u2014blacks, musicians<br />\nand the poor. Secondly, the maturing of a new<br />\ngeneration that had been relatively unmolested by the<br />\nscare tactics, a generation with money and with time to<br />\nexperiment and a generation educated not to believe in<br />\nold mythes. Thirdly, increased contact with narcotics<br />\nresulting from travel to such poppied pastures as<br />\nVietnam and the 50 state university systems.<br />\nThere is a fourth factor, something like a \"spirit of<br />\nthe times\", a special kind of mental anguish that<br />\nencourages extreme mental solutions or quests for these<br />\nsolutions. But it would take a veritable Ed Mendelsohn<br />\nof speculative sociology to try to detail that, here, now.<br />\nEnd of history. Today the coalition stands before us<br />\nweakened, withered in agony in such grotesque<br />\nmanifestations as the Baltimore busts and (trumpets,<br />\nIntercept.

Davis for Clean-Up<br /><br />\nByED MENDELSOHN<br />\nThe Democratic nomination of<br />\nHenry Gassaway Davis for Vice<br />\nPresident in 1904 is one of the few<br />\nnominations which is less easy to<br />\nexplain than the selection of Alton B.<br />\nParker for President. In the ensuing<br />\ncampaign, only two facts about Mr.<br />\nDavis became widely known. The<br />\ngentleman was between eighty and<br />\neighty-one years old, and his personal<br />\nfuture was between thirty and forty<br />\nmillion dollars.<br />\nThe faithless were so unkind as to<br />\nsuggest that Mr. Davis was nominated in<br />\norder to afford him an incentive to<br />\ncontribute to the Democratic campaign<br />\nfund. That this was indeed a motivation<br />\nfor the nomination scarcely serves to<br />\nmitigate the unpleasantness of such<br />\ncrass cynicism. Admittedly, in his old<br />\nage Mr. Davis had acquired a<br />\nconsiderable reputation for munificense.<br />\nHe had paid for a hospital in honor of<br />\nhis late son, and he had donated a high<br />\nschool to Piedmont, West Virginia. In<br />\n1904, Mr. Davis did not find the<br />\nDemocratic party an equally worthy<br />\ncharity, and he did not contribute<br />\nnearly as much as had been hoped.<br />\nThe only other obvious explanation<br />\nfor the nomination is that West Virginia<br />\nhad been something of a weathervane in<br />\npresidential elections. In ten contests<br />\nsince entering the Union, she had voted<br />\nnine times with the popular majority. In<br />\n1880 she balloted for Winfield Scott<br />\nHancock, who lost the popular vote by<br />\nless than 10,000 votes.<br />\nAdmittedly two of the state's<br />\nchoices, Tilden in 1876 and Cleveland in<br />\n, 1888, won the popular vote while losing<br />\n. The . electoral vote. Nevertheless,. the<br /><br />\nstate's record as a weathervane was<br />\ngood. John Alderson, who placed Davis<br />\nin nomination for Vice President, noted<br />\nthat West Virginia had a tendency to<br />\nvote with the nation.<br />\nIt can be affirmed that Mr. Davis' life<br />\nwas the sort of poverty-to-wealth saga<br />\nwhich myriad Americans would find<br />\nadmirable. Davis was born in 1823 in<br />\nWoodstock, Md. He was fatherless from<br />\nhis youth, and had little education.<br />\nShortly he joined the Baltimore and<br />\nOhio Railroad as a brakeman. He made<br />\nsteady progress, first to conductor and<br />\nthen to an executive position called<br />\nMaster of Transportation.<br />\nAs Master, Mr. Davis gained credit<br />\nfor a signal success. The existing<br />\npractice was for trains to travel only in<br />\ndaylight and rest overnight at stations.<br />\nDavis directed that trains run at all<br />\nhours. Even now, the B&amp;O honors Mr.<br />\nDavis by running trains at night.<br />\nThe railroad assigned Davis to a<br />\nsupervisory position in the are in<br />\nVirginia which would secede from<br />\nsecession to become West Virginia.<br />\nSurveying the terrain, he determined<br />\nthat he could build his fortune faster by<br />\nexploiting the area's natural resources.<br />\nHe therefore resigned from the railroad.<br />\nWith his brother, he formed the<br />\ncorporation of Davis &amp; Bro., which<br />\nshipped coke, coal and timer to such<br />\nlarge users as railroads.<br />\nDavis made an enormous fortune<br />\nrapidly. He facilitated shipping by<br />\nforming his own railway, the West<br />\nVirginia Coke and Coal Railroad, which<br />\nhe later sold at an appreciated value to<br />\nthe Wabash. He also acquired sufficient<br />\ncapital to organize the Piedmont Bank.<br />\nDavis began to express himself<br /><br />\npolitically as a natural outgrowth of his<br />\ncelebrity in his part of the state. He was<br />\nalways a conservative Democrat, save<br />\nfor an early period when he supported<br />\nHenry Clay. In the Civil War he opposed<br />\nthe secession of West Virginia from<br />\nVirginia. He disired the preservation of<br />\nthe Union, but did not belive that was<br />\nwas a proper means of preservation. His<br />\nposition resembled that of John Bell or<br />\nPresident Buchanan.<br />\nDavis opposed certain<br />\nReconstruction measures, particularly<br />\nthe Fifteenth Amendment permitting<br />\nNegro suffrage. After his election in<br />\n1884 President Cleveland emerged as<br />\nleader of the conservative Democrats,<br />\nand Davis and Cleveland were amicable<br />\nboth personally and politically. Davis<br />\nwas under consideration as Cleveland's<br />\nrunning mate in 1884, and he was thrice<br />\noffered positions in the Cleveland<br />\nCabinet.<br />\nDavis had never lost an election,<br />\nalthough he had not sought office for a<br />\nconsiderable period. He spent some<br />\nyears in the West Virginia Legislature,<br />\nand in 1871 commenced two terms in<br />\nthe U.S. Senate. His career in the Senate<br />\nis best characterized as unremarkable.<br />\nDavis never endulged in flights of<br />\noratory. He achieved the Chairmanship<br />\nof the Senate Committee on<br />\nAgriculture, and he preciently proposed<br />\nthe organization of Executive<br />\ndepartments of Agriculture and<br />\nCommerce. He resigned from the<br />\nSenate at the expiration of his second<br />\nterm to give closer direction to his<br />\nbusiness interests.<br />\nObviously the nomination of Davis,<br />\nlike that of Parker, was designed to<br />\n'appeal le the followers of Cleveland<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nrather than to those who idolized<br />\nBryan. Davis, like Parker, could claim<br />\nparty regularity; he had voted for Bryan<br />\ntwice, albeit without discernible<br />\nenthusiasm. It could not be said that<br />\nDavis' nomination expanded the<br />\nDemocratic vote from that which Parker<br />\ncould have achieved alone. There is an<br />\nadvantage to this, in that Parker and<br />\nDavis were admirably congenial in<br />\npolitical philosophy. If Davis had had to<br />\nsucceed Parker as President, there would<br />\nhave been continuity in the Executive<br />\nbranch.<br />\nDavis was expected to appeal' to<br />\nbusiness, as a conspicuOusly successful<br />\nentrepreneur. He might also appeal to<br />\nlabor, as he favored arbitration of labor<br />\ndisputes.<br />\nThe principal objection that can be<br />\nlodged against Davis' nomination is his<br />\nage. The Vice President has only one<br />\nindisputable function: if necessary, he<br />\nmust outlive the President. In 1904,<br />\nthere was no chartered life insurance<br />\ncompany that would have estimated<br />\nthat Davis could outlive Parker,<br />\nAdmittedly, Parker could have died<br />\nfrom assassination or another accident.<br />\nNevertheless, Davis was an elderly man<br />\nwho had given up active direction of his<br />\nbusiness enterprise, and it was<br />\nreasonable to suspect that he was<br />\ndubiously equipped to assume the<br />\nPresidency at short notice.<br />\nIt can finally be asserted that the<br />\nhonorable, conservative, lackluster Davis<br />\nably complemented a ticket headed by<br />\nthe honorable, conservative, lackluster<br />\nParker. Next week I shall wax ambitious<br />\nand attewpt to place the Parker ticket<br />\nin the 'historical perspective of the<br />\npost-Reconstruction Democratic party.<br /><br />\n,HOMEWD BALTIMORE Sept. 26, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 9<br /><br />\nAbbie and Paul Gross Out City<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nTwo of Lenny Bruce's children came to Baltimore<br />\nlast weekend, bearing the Revolution.

David Peel and the Lower East Side is a group of<br />\nfour tone-deaf acid freaks who decided one day to put<br />\non dark shades and become a \"revolutionary rock<br />\ngroup.\" Peel, a hoarse-voiced punk from some dark alley<br />\nin Brooklyn, is the group's leader, and he is distinguished<br />\nonly by his total lack of musical ability. Peel and his<br />\ngroup were also limited by their inability to play more<br />\nthan two chords. But they made the most of their<br />\nunfortunate handicap, and their varied repetoire<br />\nincluded such songs as, \"Have a Marijuana,\" \"legalize<br />\nMarijuana,\" \"Make Marijuana Legal,\" and, everyone's<br />\nfavorite, \"I Love Marijuana.\" Peel, though, can do more<br />\nthan sing, and in a charming 25 minute interlude of<br />\nrapid-fire wit, he came out with such knee-slappers as,<br />\n\"Moses was the first hippie, because he broke the tablets<br />\ninto two!\"<br />\nThe audience was remarkably passive in the face of<br />\nsuch an onslaught of mediocrity. Peel's group, however,<br />\nhas a record out on Elecktra, and you can't help but<br />\nadmire Peel's ability in conning the record executinves.<br />\nAfter Peel had mercifully cleared the stage, we all went<br />\ninto the gym to see a well-done film on Chicago.<br />\nThe Two Funnies<br />\nIn any case, I was soon outside again, waiting to see<br />\nthe two funniest revolutionaries in America.<br />\nBoth Krassner and Hoffman have been around for a<br />\nwhile, and although they have become more pro-violence<br />\nas our government gets more repressive, they are still as<br />\nclever as ever.<br />\nUsing the yardstick that all great satire is in bad taste,<br />\nKrassner must be considered one of the best satirists in<br />\nRealist , is<br />\nAmerica.

Paul imagined the poor wife saying to<br />\nher husband, \"Don't give me any of that 'living fetus'<br />\ncrap, you.shmuck!\"<br />\nNot surprisingly, Krassner says that the only two<br />\npeople who ever really influenced him were Lenny<br />\nBruce, and Abbie Hoffman.<br />\nHoffman in Trouble<br />\nAbbie Hoffman is by now one of the most famous<br />\nrevolutionaries in America.

In other<br />\nwords. I don't agree with everything they say.<br />\nKrassner, dressed in a blue-denim outfit, spoke first.<br />\nHis wiseguy Jewish accent fitted perfectly the tenor of<br />\nhis speech. Seated behind him was that SDS contingent,<br />\nand Krassner had to suffer through their cries of \"male<br />\nchauvinist\" and \"revisionist pig\" as he made his<br />\ncomments. Mere written exerpts can only give you a pale<br />\nfacsimile of the real thing, so picture, if you can, a<br />\ncurly-haired guy grapsing a mike, and rapping in a special<br />\nway to the audience.<br />\n\"Did you dig the Miss America contest?

And it won't have just snatches of<br />\nsnatches, like in 'I am Curious,' but real spread shots,<br />\ninsertions, and so on. THAT would be a pioneering<br />\nfilm!\"<br />\nKrassner paused, and then started talking about the<br />\nwar, getting more serious as he went on.<br />\nThe Real Gap<br />\n\"I wonder,\" he said, \"whether Walter Cronkite<br />\nincluded Ho Chi Minh as part of the weekly body<br />\ncount.\" After the SDS chant of\"Ho Lives!\" died down,<br />\nhe started talking again.<br />\n\"The real generation gap is between a 19 year old<br />\ncollege kid worried about his career and a 14 year old<br />\nVietnamese child risking his life fighting the Americans.\"<br />\nBefore introducing Abbie, he concluded, \"As long as<br />\nothers aren't free, I'm not, so I try to see things through<br />\nthe eyes of a Vietnamese child.\"<br />\nAbbie bounced on stage next, dressed in all brown,<br />\nand started talking as his wild hair was whipped by a<br />\ncool breeze.

The ban originally affected only<br />\ngrapes from the Guimarra Vineyards<br />\nCorporation, the largest producer of table grapes<br />\nin the United States. It later expanded to cover<br />\nall grapes because Guimarra began to sell its<br />\ngrapes through other growers.<br /><br />\nCesar Chavez, President of the United<br />\nFarm Workers Organizing Committee, will<br />\nbring his campaign fOr a nation-wide grape<br />\nboycott to the Hopkins campus today.<br />\nChavez is to speak in Shriver Hall at 2<br />\np.m. On Saturday he will lead a picketing<br />\nrally at the Ingleside Shopping Center in<br />\nCatonsville at 10 a.m.<br /><br />\nThe boycott has gradually become effective<br />\nthroughout the nation and in Great Britain and<br />\nScandinavian countries. Nationwide grape sales<br />\nwere off 12% in 1968 and at the start of this year<br />\nsales were down 15%. In June ten growers in<br />\nCalifornia agreed to talk with the union, but this<br />\ngroup is responsible for only 12% of the grapes<br />\nproduced in California.<br /><br />\nAccording to Time Magazine, Chavez<br />\ncomes from a background of poverty and<br />\nprejudice that motivated him to lead<br />\nMexican-American grape pickers in an<br />\nattempt to move out of impoverishment.<br />\nChavez began his campaign in 1962 by<br /><br />\norganizing the United Farm Workers<br />\nAssociation (UFWA). Its first meeting, in<br />\n1962, drew 287 people - - in less than a<br />\nyear the organization had a membership<br />\nof 1,000.<br /><br />\nMany politicians have supported the efforts of<br />\nChavez, perhaps the first of these was the late<br />\nSenator Robert F. Kennedy. Others who have<br />\nbacked the workers are Senator Edward M.<br />\nKennedy, Senator Jacob Javits and Chicago's<br />\nMayor Richard Daley.<br /><br />\nPublishing Misfit<br /><br />\nChavez then initiated the publication<br />\nof a union newspaper - called El Malcriado<br />\n(The Misfit) whose circulation is now<br />\n18,000. In 1964 the union had grown<br />\nenough to challenge the authority of the<br />\ngrape growers. Teh NFWA took a grower<br />\nto court for paying less than the $1.25<br />\nminimum wage. The proceedings lasted<br />\nmonths but finally a small wage increase<br />\nwas won for the workers.<br />\nChavez has continually had difficulty in<br />\nmaintaining a consistent following. This is mainly<br />\ndue to the crushing financial need for the<br />\nMexican-American workers to stay employed.<br />\nAlso the grape workers are a highly transient<br />\ngroup and tend to be indifferent to the union.<br /><br />\nant MI<br /><br />\nHA SSV1D<br /><br />\nptios OS1?3<br /><br />\n816 \\Oil 01<br />\n(INV HDIVIHCI<br /><br />\nMIIII- OM<br /><br />\nSUBSCRIBE NOW. ..WE'LL BILL YOU<br />\ncopies of the 1970 HULLABALOO at S8.95 each.<br /><br />\nt=1<br /><br />\nINN<br /><br />\nIn Hawaii the Young Americans for Freedom<br />\norganized an airlift of the forbidden fruit from<br />\nthe mainland to give the islanders a better supply<br />\nof grapes.

Serena from the<br />\nAthletic Department, proved to be, by itself, a very dull meeting.<br />\nHowever, the poorly planned actions of Robert Bilgrave, Director of<br />\nStudent Affairs casts the meeting into a less harmonious light.<br />\nThe action I am referring to is Mr. Bilgrave's refusal to allow this<br />\nNews-Letter reporter to attend the meeting. Apart from the personal<br />\ninsult I felt, the entire issue of open meetings is renewed. Being<br />\nbanned from this or any other student-faculty-administration<br />\nmeeting is and was uncalled for.<br />\nIn this instance, Bilgrave has admitted that perhaps the<br />\nNews-Letter should have been allowed to attend. But my point is<br />\nhad the meeting been open in the first place there would be no need<br />\nfor apologies.<br />\nLimits Degree of Involvement<br />\nOn the one hand, the university encourages a student to get<br />\ninvolved but then it turns around and throws up barriers to limit the<br />\ndegree to which one can get involved. Put yourself in my position:<br />\nYOU ARE A SPORTS EDITOR BANNED.<br />\nSecondly, the News-Letter, especially in the Sports pages, is used<br />\nas a vehicle to reach the students with pertinent announcements<br />\n(i.e., team meetings and ticket announcements). After using the<br />\nNews-Letter in this sense, the university is very inconsistent in<br />\nexcluding students from the source of the news.<br />\nYOU ARE A SPORTS EDITOR BANNED.<br />\nOftentimes the News-Letter is accused of misrepresentation of<br />\nthe facts, pr, shall we say, yellow journalism. But, as Bilgrave's<br />\norigin:'.1 action shows, we are sometimes kept from getting a<br />\nfirst-hand accurate report.<br />\nWorthwhile Service<br />\nThe News-Letter, especially in the Sports Pages, provides a<br />\nworthwhile service to the Hopkins community. It is time the<br />\nuniversity recognized this. We are all part of the Hopkins family. We<br />\nhave a strong interest in Hopkins and in Hopkins Athletics or else we<br />\nwouldn't be here.<br />\nThe Sept 18th meeting did include students. Why was it so<br />\nessential to exclude the News-Letter?<br />\nYOU ARE A SPORTS EDITOR BANNED.<br />\nThe crux of the meeting was to find the cause of a<br />\nmisunderstanding between the Orientation Committee and the<br />\nAthletic Center over the concept of the Freshman picnic. The matter<br />\nin a nutshell boiled down to a lack of communication.<br />\nCenter of Fault<br />\nMarshall Turner took most of the wind out of the sails of the<br />\nOrientation Committee when he admitted that the center was<br />\ncompletely at fault for the lack of available equipment and partially<br />\nat fault for the lack of available facilities. However,in analysis, both<br />\nparties were to blame. To say that one was more at fault than the<br />\nother would be pure speculation.<br />\nOther aspects touched on in the meeting were work-study for<br />\nstudents at the gym and the possibility of an Advisory Committee to<br />\naid the Atheltic Department. According to Hal Thorne, Bilgrave's<br />\nIssistant, a joint memorandum of both the Orientation Committee<br />\nand the Office of Student Affairs should clarify the Orientation<br />\ndifficulties in the future and perhaps shed some light on the other<br />\ntopics of the Sept 18th meeting.<br />\nAt present some understanding has been reached between this<br />\nreporter and Bilgrave. Nevertheless, long after the particulars of this<br />\nmeeting are forgotten one line will remain<br />\nYOU- ARE A SPORTS EDITOR BANNED.<br /><br />\nFootball Line-up<br />\nThe probable starting line-up for<br />\ntommorrow's Varsity Football opener against<br />\nMuhlenberg is:<br />\nDEFENSE<br /><br />\nOFFENSE<br />\nTE<br />\nLT<br />\nLG<br />\nRG<br />\nRT<br />\nSE<br />\nQB<br />\nFB<br />\nTB<br />\nWB<br /><br />\nNo.87 Steve Latson<br />\n76 Mike Wilbanks<br />\n65 Dennis Lanahan<br />\n54 Gus Slotman<br />\n64 Tom Sawyer<br />\n78 Mike Malloy<br />\n82 Dave Pickall<br />\n12 Bob Pfeifer<br />\n34 Steve Hata<br />\n40 Paul Weiss<br />\n10 Charlie qoker,<br /><br />\nDT<br />\nLB<br />\nLB<br />\nLB<br />\nDB<br />\nDB<br />\nDB<br />\n17..c..,<br />\n,<br /><br />\n:\u2022L'Jli<br />\nI<br />\nt<br /><br />\n83 Doug Hein<br />\n74 Howard Weaver<br />\n75 Ken Brown<br />\n45 John Diorio<br />\n62 Jim Lotto<br />\n53 Chuck Pinsky<br />\n28 Rob Hacker<br />\n10 Charlie Coker<br />\n20 Bob Hyde<br />\n21 Henry Robey<br />\nsrt I ifilif.)111.1<br />\n1',,4 j)<br /><br />\nBy LEWIS GUTMAN<br />\nWith tommorrow starting Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference football, the Blue<br />\nJays will have a lot to think about. One<br />\nthing is last Saturday's loss to the<br />\nLebanon Valley Flying Dutchmen;<br />\nanother is the possible loss of Paul Weiss,<br />\nthe Jays' leading rusher last year and the<br />\nonly experienced running back.<br />\nThe Blue Jays will face Muhlenberg, one of<br />\nthe strongest contenders in the Conference. Last<br />\nyear, the Hopkins team narrowly defeated them,<br />\n30-28. Fourteen of Muldenberg's starters have<br />\nreturned from last year. Hopkins' 1968 team<br />\ngraduated last June with the exception of some<br />\nreserves and a few first stringers.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were plagued by inexperienced<br />\nplayers in their 37-7 loss to Lebanon Valley last<br />\nSaturday. Their play together was confused and<br />\nsisordered for football. Junior quarterback Bob<br />\nPfiefer spent most of the afternoon running with<br />\nthe ball either through the line on missed<br />\nhandoffs or around the end to escape Lebanon<br />\nValley's onrushing lineman. Running backs<br />\nHenry Robey and Steve Hata, while gaining 119<br />\nyards rushing, fumbled three times on hurried<br />\npitchouts by Pfiefer. One of those fumbles was<br />\nrecovered by Lebanon Valley and taken in, eight<br />\nplays later, for a touchdown.<br />\nThe defense had a worse time of it. The line<br />\ngot in only three times to dump Lebanon's<br />\nquarterback Robin Kbrnmeyer, who went back<br />\ninto the pocket to throw almost thirty times,<br />\ncompleting sixty percent of his passes for 158<br />\nyards and scrambling for 112 yards when his<br />\nreceivers weren't open. Kornmeyer, his running<br />\nback Tom Koons, who ran in three touchdowns,<br />\nand his receiver, Greg Teter, kept the Blue Jay<br />\nsecondary unorganized and ineffective.<br />\nDutchmen Score Five<br />\nThe Flying Dutchmen scored five touchdowns,<br />\nfour of them on the ground. The first score came<br />\nat the end of the first quafter after Kornmeyer<br />\nscrambled for 33 yards bringing the ball into<br />\nHonkins territory. Six plays later, Koons plunged<br /><br />\ninto the end zone from one yard out, giving the<br />\nFlying Dutchmen a 7-0 lead.<br />\nBut the Blue Jays rallied on their next set of<br />\ndowns. Steve Hata found a big hole off tackle<br />\nand ran downfield for a thirty yard gain. The<br />\nBlue Jay drive stalled and Charley Coker punted.<br />\nHis kick, a low line drive, hit on the ten yard line<br />\nand bounced all the way to the three, stopping<br />\ndead there. THe Blue Jay defense held tight for<br />\nthree downs forcing the Dutchmen to punt from<br />\ndeep inside their own territory. The Blue Jays<br />\ngot the ball first and ten on Lebanon Valley's 31<br />\nyard line. Bob Pfiefer connected with Senior end<br />\nSteve Latson for fourteen yards and a first down.<br />\nOn the next play, Pfiefer handed off to Steve<br />\nHata, who went straight up the middle and into<br />\nthe end zone untouched. After a successful<br />\nconversion, the score was tied.<br />\nDefense Breaks Down<br />\nAfter that, the Hopkins defense virtually<br />\nbroke down. Before the half was over, the<br />\nDutchmen scored three touchdowns, giving them<br />\na 30-7 lead. In the second quarter, the Blue Jay<br />\noffense controlled the ball for only nine downs.<br />\nThe ball was monopolized by the Dutchmen,<br />\nenroute to their 30-7 lead.<br />\nThe second half saw the ball being shifted<br />\nback and forth between both teams. With the<br />\nexception of a single Lebanon Valley<br />\ntouchdown,there was no scoring.<br />\nThe Blue Jay offense was generated by<br />\nquarterback Pfiefer, running backs Robey and<br />\nHata, end Dave Pickall, and flanker Charley<br />\nCoker. Pfiefer was under constant pressure from<br />\nLebanon's linemen, and the Hopkins offense<br />\nshowed this. Passes were hurried, handoffs were<br />\nmissed, and fumbles occurred. Once past the<br />\nlineman, however, the offense was effective.<br />\nDownfield blocking and the lack of penalities(32<br />\nyards in penalities compared to Lebanon Valley's<br />\n65)were two points in the Blue Jays' favor.<br />\nWith a week in between Lebanon Valley and<br />\nMuhlenberg in addition to the possible return of<br />\nPaul Weiss, there could be a big difference in the<br />\nBlue Jays.<br /><br />\nSports<br />\nBriefs<br />\nWrestling Meeting<br />\nThere will be a meeting of all<br />\nvarsity and freshman wrestling<br />\ncandidates on Tuesday,<br />\nSeptember 30, 7 p.m. in the<br />\nclassroom of the Athletic Center.<br />\nFaces in the Crowd<br />\nOn page 62 of last Sunday's<br />\nColts-Rams Program appears \"A<br />\nFace In The Crowd\".

Bob<br />\nKnauff, a graduate of Hopkins is the Varsity<br />\nCoach and Tom Savidge, who attended<br />\nLycoming college in Williamsport Penn., is the<br />\nnew Freshmen coach.<br />\nKnauff, a native of Baltimore, played soccer,<br />\nfreshmen basketball, and lacrosse at Hopkins after<br />\ngraduating from Milford Mill High.

Barrette was not well liked by the players and<br />\nwas considered to have very little insight and knowledge<br />\nof the game. Whereas, Coach Knauff, seems to be in<br />\nmuch greater favor with the squad.<br />\nThe Freshmen soccer coach, Tom Savidge was varsity<br />\nsoccer coach at Southern High in Baltimore these past<br />\ntwo years. Savidge never played soccer until his<br />\nFreshmen year in college. However, he played three<br />\nyears of ball as a halfback and inside on the Lycoming<br />\nVaristy team.<br />\nSavidge believes this year's freshmen team to be a<br />\nstrong one. He feels the defense is the mainstay of the<br />\nteam. The front line though, he says, is not set, and<br />\nprobably will remain undecided, until the opening game.<br />\nThe Varsity soccer team was schellacked by a<br />\npowerful Howard squad last Saturday. However, the<br />\nproblem of the defeat lies not in a comparison of talent<br /><br />\nof the two clubs, but rather a lack of hustle by the<br />\nHopkins team. Their defensemen were beaten constantly<br />\nto the ball by the Howard forward line who were thus<br />\nallowed to dominate too much territory and control the<br />\npace of the game.<br /><br />\nSophomore Wes Daub toes ball in Howard scrimmage last<br />\nSaturday.

Dr. Engel,<br />\nwho was recently appointed to the<br />\nHopkins faculty, does his work in a tiny<br />\nthird floor lab adjacent to his office.<br />\n\"There has been a widely held belief,\"<br />\nDr. Engel explained, \"that functions<br />\nmediated by the autonomic, or.<br />\ninvoluntary, nervous system are not<br />\nsusceptible to operant conditioning.\"<br />\nBut Engel noted that the evidence in<br />\nsupport of this theory is insufficient.<br />\nPast researchers who have tried to<br />\neach control of involuntary responses<br />\nhave suffered constant failure. Yet, in<br />\nfailing, they have proved only that their<br />\ntechniques were imperfect. The victory<br />\nwas due, in the end, to the engineers<br />\nwho develJped the equipment and<br />\nmethods necessary to achieve such a<br />\ngoal.<br /><br />\n\"Much is not known. What is known<br />\nis impressive.\" The gap between present<br />\nknowledge of the control of the<br />\nautonomic nervous system and the<br />\namazing achievements of the yoga<br />\nmaster is vast. Medical science until<br />\nrecently either marveled at the powers<br />\nof the Eastern mystics or dismissed the<br />\nevidence as not well-documented.<br />\nThis last claim is all too true. The<br />\nprobings of the curious scientist are<br />\nanathewa to truly religious.mystics, and<br />\neven now data drips in from researchers<br />\nin India very slowly. The best masters of<br />\nthe art of body control are completely<br />\ninacessable to western observers.<br />\nIn Dr. Engel's lab is a single bed<br />\nsurrounded by banks of electronic<br />\nmonitoring and control equipment. A<br />\npatient referred to him as a likely<br />\ncandidate receives careful instruction in<br />\nresearch methods and aims, the nature<br />\nof the heart and his own cardiac<br />\nproblem.<br />\nAt the foot of the bed is a panel with<br />\nthree colored lights. Electric impulses<br />\ndetected by electrodes taped to the<br />\npatient's body are transmitted to the<br />\nmaze of wires and solid state circuitry<br />\npacked eight feet high in metal cabinets.<br />\nEach subject's treatment is tailored to<br /><br />\nhis problem. If, for instance, the<br />\nproblem is one of irregular heart beat,<br />\nthe machine signals reinforcement with<br />\nthe appropriate light whenever the<br />\nrhythm is smooth. If, however, the<br />\nheart should decide to add an extra beat<br />\nout of time, a red light signals the<br />\nmachine's disappointment.<br />\nSessions are held twice a day, six<br />\ndays a week, and while the patient is in<br />\nhis room, his heart beat is monitored by<br />\na remote sensing device which transmits<br />\ninformation back to the lab, where it is<br />\nrecorded on magnetic tape. The tape is<br />\nlater analyzed by a computer to<br />\ndetermine whether there has been any<br />\nimprovement. In many cases, Engel has \u2022<br />\nbeen able to induce permanent<br />\nimprovement of the condition of an<br />\norganically-ill heart.<br />\nExperiments of this sort are<br />\nrelatively new. The first reports of<br />\nsuccess in autonomic control were<br />\nbrought to the attention of American<br />\ninvestigators in an abstract translated<br />\nfrom the Russian in the late 1950's. But<br />\nthe abstract did not contain the detailed<br />\nresults of the investigation, and it<br />\nreamined unnoticed until about 1961,<br />\nwhen Dr. Herbert Kimmel, then at the<br />\nUniversity of Florida, reported success<br /><br />\nin teaching subjects to control galvanic<br />\nskin response.<br />\nBy 1965, the natural course of heart<br />\nresearch, aided by the development of<br />\nnew electronic tools, led several<br />\ninvestigators into the field of autonomic<br />\ncontrol.<br />\n\"People are re-examining old<br />\nconcepts like mind-body dualism,\"<br />\nstated Dr. Engel. He explained that it is<br />\nno longer acceptable to talk about<br />\ntwo-sided concepts such as the<br />\nconscious as opposed to the<br />\nunconscious, or voluntary versus<br />\nautonomic nervous control. Rather,<br />\nthere is a continuum, a smooth path<br />\nfrom one end to the other.<br />\nEngel offered an analogy. There is a<br />\nkind of fish that inhabits the Amazon<br />\nriver from its headwaters down to the<br />\nsea. The fish interbreed with their<br />\nneighbors directly up and down stream<br />\nand in this way the gene plasm is<br />\ntransmitted from one end of the river to<br />\nthe other. Yet, if one of these animals is<br />\ntaken from his natural waters and<br />\nmoved down stream, instead of<br />\nbreeding, it will fight to the death with<br />\nanother of the same species.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nSex Ed. Sanction<br />\nCardinal Shehan, Archbishop of Baltimore, said this<br />\nweek that sex education has a place in the public<br />\nschools, but added that parents should have the right to<br />\ndecide whether their children should receive instruction<br />\nin the controversial subject.<br />\nIntroducing a formal statement on sex education<br />\nsigned by himself and the two other bishops with<br />\njurisdiction in Maryland, the Cardinal stated that, while<br />\nparents have primary responsibility for sex education,<br />\nthere is \"no reason\" for them \"not to share that<br />\nresponsibility with the schools.\"<br />\nHowever, Shehan added that parents have the right<br />\nand obligation to protest sex education programs that<br />\nviolate their \"moral and religious convictions,\" and<br />\nshould be allowed to remove their children from such<br />\nprograms. Presently, the State Board of Education<br />\nby-law on sex education does not give parents the<br />\nauthority to take their children out of class.<br /><br />\nBoycott Support<br />\nTwenty-four prominent professors have signed a<br />\nstatement supporting the student boycott of classes on<br />\nOct. 15 as a demonstration against the war in Vietnam.<br />\nAmong the signers are John Kenneth Galbraith, the<br />\neconomist and former ambassador to India, Noam<br />\nChomsky, the linguist from the Massachusetts Institute<br />\nof Technology and Hans Morgenthau, the political<br />\nscientist from the City University of New York.<br />\nThe professors contended that President Nixon's<br />\n\"gradual and partial displacement of American troops is<br />\nnot the substantive change in policy needed to end the<br />\nwar.\" Their statement claimed that the student<br />\nmoratorium would provide \"massive evidence\" that \"the<br />\nmajority of Americans recognize the senselessness of<br />\nVietnam and desire an end to that war.\"<br />\nSam Brown, one of the organizers of the student<br />\nboycott, said in an interview that support for the protest<br />\nhad \"mushroomed\" since President Nixon's<br />\nannouncements last week of the withdrawal of 35,000<br />\ntroops from Vietnam and a two-month suspension of the<br />\ndraft. Declared Mr. Brown,\"The people can see that this<br />\ntype of action is plainly a fraud.\"<br /><br />\nNew Ivy Look<br />\nDartmouth freshmen may have a new look this year<br />\nas the school, which has graduated only 150 blacks in its<br />\nthis fall,<br />\n200 year history, admitted 90 Negroes<br />\ncompared to last year's record-breaking thirty.<br />\nPreviously the administration has held the standard<br />\nposition that they \"would love to take more, but there<br />\njust aren't enough qualified blacks,\" However, black<br />\nstudents convinced the administration last year to give<br />\nthem some money and they would find the students.<br />\nOut of 230 black applicants, 130 were accepted and<br />\n0 decided to attend Dartmouth this fall. Unlike<br /><br />\nprevious years, at least half of these students came from<br />\npoor families.<br />\nIn order to accommodate the freshmen with poorer<br />\nacademic backgrounds, several departments have made<br />\nmajor changes in their course offerings. This year the<br />\nEnglish Department offered a special freshman course<br />\ntaught by an expert in remedial writing. Also a math<br />\ncourse below the level of calculus was introduced to<br />\naccomodate black entrants.<br />\nOther schools have also increased the number of<br />\nblack students admitted this fall. Harvard has 95 Negro<br />\nfreshmen this year (compared to 40 in 1966) Brown has<br />\n77 (eight in 1966) Weslyan, 51(30 in 1966)and Yale 96<br />\n(31 in 1966).<br /><br />\nAfro Studies<br />\nAn analysis of \"the black revolution\" is one of the<br />\nfifteen courses offered this semester at Harvard by the<br />\ndepartment of Afro- American studies established by the<br />\nuniversity last April.<br />\nThe new curriculum includes studies on slavery,<br />\nAfrican and Western Hemisphere history and black<br />\nexperiences in labor, politics, and the arts. An<br />\nIntroduction to Black Civilization will survey African<br />\nhistory from 800 B.C. to 1591 A.D., while the origins of<br />\nslavery as a social institution will be explored in another<br />\ncourse.<br />\nOn April 22, Harvards's Faculty of Arts and Sciences<br />\nmade the black studies program a`full interdisciplinary<br />\ndepartment and allowed students to take part in<br />\ndecisions formulating the department's course work. In a<br />\n31-page report announcing the new courses, a committee<br />\nof the Afro-American studies department also proposed<br />\nthe creation of a W. E. B. DuBois Institute for<br />\nAfro-American Research.<br />\nDr. Ewart Guinier, who left Harvard College during<br />\nthe Depression, was selected chairman of the new<br />\ndepartment. Eight other faculty members, who,like Dr.<br />\nGuinier, are black, were appointed to the department<br />\nthis summer.<br /><br />\n\"We Want Life\"<br />\nThe newest and most popular student group at New<br />\nYork University is a party-throwing organization of<br />\nhedonists who are trying to create an atmosphere similar<br />\nto that of the recent Woodstock music festival.<br />\nFormed last March as a small group to protest<br />\novercrowding in a psychology class, the Transcendental<br />\nStudents went on a stage of semi-political \"freak-outs\"<br />\nin vacant classrooms, study halls, and a former<br />\nrestaurant. The freak-outs were billed as attempts to<br />\n\"make N.Y.U. livable.\" They usually featured wine,<br />\nmarijuana, movies, political satire, acid-rock and often<br />\nthe New York City Police Department, called in to end<br />\nthe festivities.<br />\nEven the N.Y.U. administration has acknowledged<br />\nthe group's incluence. This term the administration<br />\nallocated $5,000 for the group to renovate Harouts, a<br />\nformer Greek restaurant and popular student gathering<br />\nplace.<br />\nIn spite of their outward appearance, Transcendental<br />\nStudents claim that they are a radical political<br />\norganization. When asked what they wanted to make of<br /><br />\nsociety, one member explained, \"We want a society<br />\nwhere you can smoke grass and drop acid and have a<br />\nplace like Harouts. We want a revolution that will see<br />\nDick Nixon out of the White House and people living<br />\nthere who will paint it different colors and invite people<br />\nto camp on the lawn--we want life.\"<br /><br />\nMedical Care<br />\nBaltimore's black medical society, in cooperation<br />\nwith community groups, is drawing up plans to provide<br />\ncomprehensive medical care for between 30,000 and<br />\n50,000 inner-city residents. Louis L. Randall, president<br />\nof the 85-member group known as the Monumental City<br />\nMedical Society, said, \"We would like to see things<br />\norganized within six months and certainly in action<br />\nwithin twelve to eighteen months.\" As outlined by Dr.<br />\nRandall, the plan envisioned a co-operative effort among<br />\nhospitals, clinics and individual doctors to provide<br />\ntop-quality care to persons on Medicaid and those<br />\nmedically indigent.<br />\n_ There is currently a \"health crisis\" in Baltimore<br />\ncaused by a shortage of Negro physicians and<br />\naccentuated by cutbacks in federal health funds and<br />\ntardy payments by the state under the Medicaid<br />\nprogram, Randall explained. Only two percent of the<br />\ncity's physicians are black, Dr. Randall also noted, and<br />\nmany tend to \"cluster\" their practices. About<br />\none-fourth of these doctors are 60 years old or older,<br />\nand many are specialists as opposed to general<br />\npractitioners.<br /><br />\nEveryone Chided<br />\nThe university, its faculty, and its students were all<br />\nberated in three lectures given this week by the<br />\nChancellor of the State University of New York, Dr.<br />\nSamuel B. Gould.<br />\nStating, \"It is not the student who is alienated today,<br />\nit is the college and university, \"Dr. Gould charged<br />\nAmerica's educational institutions with failing to adapt<br />\nto the times and ignoring their responsibilities to<br />\nstudents and to the outside community.<br />\nGould also criticized the methods of student<br />\nprotesters and their tendency to ignore the goals of their<br />\nactions. \"Campus agitators are rarely, if ever, students or<br />\nfaculty from the scientific disciplines; they tend to come<br />\nout of the social sciences, which are relatively inexact in<br />\ntheir researches, and the humanities, which are and<br />\nshould be occupied with unanswerable questions,\" he<br />\nnoted. \"Students should not and cannot come to the<br />\nuniversity with the expectation that they are going to<br />\nrun it any more than they should enter a course of study<br />\nwith the presupposition that they already know all the<br />\nprofessor has to foffer them.\"<br />\nIn the future, the chancellor envisioned vast<br />\n\"communiversities\" that would combine schools on<br />\nevery level from elementary to post-graduate, as well as<br />\nmuseums, libraries, theaters, art galleries, TV and radio<br />\nstations, newspapers and hospitals.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40348, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "d97ee116-2015-40f1-abe5-fd42bed50094", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13988-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13988, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "2cf3ca7b-0256-40c8-b0ee-95fc20eed914", "url": "/node/13988"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "fe22c42a-a72e-4695-a986-35b1192270b2"}]}
