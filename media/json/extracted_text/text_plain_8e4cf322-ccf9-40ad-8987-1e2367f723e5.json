The meet will be held<br />\nin the Fifth Regiment Armory,<br />\nwhich has one of the best indoor<br />\ntracks in the East. For several<br />\nweeks Mr'. Theodore Kistler, secretary of the games committee, has<br />\nbeen kept busy receiving entry<br />\nblanks from a large number of<br />\nclubs<br />\nand<br />\nschools, colleges<br />\nthroughout the East. Among<br />\nthose who will compete are some<br />\nof the best athletes in the country,<br />\nwho .will furnish plenty of entertainment for local track fans.<br />\nThe program for the evening in'eludes nine open handicap events,<br />\nfive events closed to members of<br />\nthe S. A. I. A. A. and three interscholastic handicap events. In addition to these there will be the annual 1000-yard special and a large<br />\nnumber of relay races. Yale, Syracuse and Penn State College will<br />\nmeet in a two-mile relay race that<br />\nshould furnish enough excitement<br />\nfor the most critical fan. Penn<br />\nState may also enter a mile relay<br />\nteam to run against the fast aggregation from M. I. T. Supporters<br />\nof Baltimore City College will<br />\nhave an opportunity to see the<br />\nlocal boys in a four-mile relay<br />\nevent against a team picked froni<br />\n40 Canadian high schools. A<br />\nshort time ago the City College<br />\nteam put up a game fight against<br />\nfour of the best Johns Hopkins<br />\nmilers, and showed that they will<br />\nundoubtedly give the visitors a<br />\nrun for their money. Last year<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins inaugurated<br />\nthe idea of holding annually a special 1000-yard run open only to<br />\ncolleges invited to compete. The<br />\nwinner of the race will receive a<br />\nhandsome silver cup. The colleges<br />\nwho have entered men in this event<br />\nare Georgia Tech, Lafayette, Penn<br />\nState, Delaware, Lehigh, Washington and Lee, Syracuse and University of Virginia. Crawford of<br />\nLafayette, who finished a close<br />\nsecond in this event last year, will<br />\nagain compete.<br />\nThe Hopkins team has been<br />\nhard at work putting on the finishing touches before the big meet.<br />\nThe team suffered a severe loss<br />\nwhen \"Joe\" Thompson, the star<br />\n\u2022 quarter miler and hurdler, pulled<br />\na muscle in his leg. Supporters of<br />\nthe Black and Blue are still hoping<br />\nthat \"Joe\" will be able to compete<br />\nthis Saturday evening, but the<br />\ncoaches are not willing to risk in(Continued on page 4, col. 4)<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., FEBRUARY 24, 1921<br />\n<br />\nTRUSTEES TO COMPLETE ALUMNI<br />\nDORMITORY FUND<br />\nAnnouncement Made by Dr. Goodnow at Alumni Banquet.<br />\nEnthusiastic Meeting at Baltimore Country Club.<br />\nF. D. Roosevelt Speaks:<br />\nIn speaking before the alumni at their annual banquet, held last<br />\nTuesday at the Baltimore Country Club, President Goodnow made the<br />\nwelcome announcement that the trustees will in all probability complete<br />\nthe alumni dormitory fund. Money for the purpose will be appro<br />\npriated from the bequest of William Bennett Paca, and ground will be<br />\nbroken before July 1. The fund now totals $215,000, while the cost<br />\nof the building will be about $365,000.<br />\nDr. Goodnow also praised the loyalty of the college alumni, whose<br />\ninfluence and interest in its affairs is productive of much good to the<br />\ninstitution.<br />\n, F. D. Roosevelt, the principal speaker of the evening, spoke of the<br />\nwork of college men during the war, and of their part in the future<br />\nof the country. Even before this country entered the struggle, he said,<br />\nmany college alumni were urging preparedness, while they furnished a<br />\nlarge proportion of the leadership and direction once we were in.<br />\nIt is the duty of college men, Mr. Roosevelt believes, to continue to<br />\nexercise this influence in the trying days of reconstruction which face<br />\nus. The nation will undoubtedly weather the storm of financial trouble,<br />\nbut \"it is important to remember that no nation can weather a financial<br />\nstorm if the rest of the world is allowed to go to pot.\"<br />\nDr. Charles Caspari, '96, of St. Louis, who came on especially for<br />\nthe dinner, made a plea for continued activity on the part of the Alumni<br />\nAssociation. Now that the dormitory is provided for, there is no<br />\nreason why the association should not raise funds for other buildings.<br />\n\"That is what an alumni association is for.\" In this view he was supported by George L. Radcliffe and R. Brent Keyser, who felt that the<br />\nwork should not stop.<br />\nDr. Harvey B. Stone, vice-president of the Varsity Club, made a<br />\nstatement concerning the work of the Homewood Company, the holding<br />\ncompany for athletic affairs. He believes, he said, that the greatest<br />\nneed of the University is for a gymnasium. He also announced that<br />\nthe Varsity Club was considering the establishment of several seholarships as war memorials, to be awarded not solely for scholarship, but<br />\nsomewhat on the Rhodes plan; that is, for scholarship, character, physical ability and leadership.<br />\nPreceding the dinner, the annual election of members of the Alumni<br />\nCouncil was held. The results were as follows: Council representatives, W. S. Symington for Ph.D. group; Dr. G. S. Robinson for<br />\n'M.D. group; W. W.Pagon for A.B. group, and C. W.

Goodnow, president of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nbrought out as the main point of<br />\nhis opening address the fact that<br />\nuntil greater funds are available,<br />\nlimitation of students will be necessary.<br />\n\"Where it is necessary that the<br />\nnumber of students be limited,\"<br />\nsaid President Goodnow, \"the<br />\nlimitation should be based on<br />\nmerit, merit as determined by examination, by intelligence tests as<br />\nsoon as they may be so developed<br />\nthat we can with confidence rely<br />\nupon them, and by record of performance. Above all, we should<br />\nnot retain a student as to whom<br />\nin the light of such facts as we can<br />\nsafely use we feel certain that he<br />\ncannot make good. Democracy in<br />\neducation may have its place in<br />\nthe lower schools. Perhaps it is<br />\ntrue that those schools should be<br />\nmade to fit the student, though of<br />\nthat there would appear to be<br />\nsome doubt. Higher education is,<br />\nhowever, organized to prepare for<br />\nthe professions, the qualifications<br />\nof which are definitely fixed.<br />\n\"Here there is no room, particularly in the crowded conditions we<br />\nnow face, for the student who does<br />\nnot either have the ability to justify the necessary expenditure of<br />\nmoney and effort which his training involves, or who is not willing<br />\nto make his education the serious<br />\npurpose of his life.\"<br />\nFollowing his address Dr. Goodthe annual<br />\nnow announced that '<br />\nanonymous donor of $5000 for the<br />\nfurtherance of \"art as applied to<br />\nscience\" had again donated the<br />\nsum; that James Schouler a<br />\nhad<br />\nformer Hopkins lecturer, '<br />\nawarded the University $14,000 for<br />\nlecture endowment, bringing the<br />\ntotal lecture endowment fund to<br />\n$25,000, and the late William Bennett Paca had made the University the residuary legatee of his<br />\nestate, with the expression of the<br />\nwish that the money be used for<br />\nthe building fund for the erection<br />\nof college buildings at Homewood.<br />\nThe alumni fund for the memorial dormitory has reached $215,000, Dr. Goodnow announced, and<br />\nthe work of building would be begun as soon as practicable.<br />\n(Continued on me,4, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, FEBRUARY 24, 1921<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nWith acknowledgments to K.

The great number<br />\nof men who failed in three subjects<br />\nand hence had to leave the university was not the result of a definite<br />\nattempt on part of the faculty to<br />\nreduce the enrollment by failing<br />\nmen, as was rumored in student<br />\ncircles two weeks ago. The university is indeed too crowded for the<br />\nlimited facilities to permit the best<br />\ninstruction in all subjects, but it<br />\nhas not undertaken such a policy<br />\nto reduce numbers. The Dean has<br />\nrepeatedly pointed out that the<br />\ntrouble lay with the lack of application or else just general worthlessness in both cases the individual lost. Several of the professors when interviewed about the<br />\nmatter were certain that the examinations they had given were<br />\neasy.<br />\nDr. L. S. Hulburt, who is head<br />\nof the undergraduate department<br />\nof mathematics and has charge of<br />\nseven sections of Math 1 and four<br />\nof Math 2, said that while a great<br />\n<br />\nOF<br />\n<br />\nFINE<br />\n<br />\nPIPES<br />\n<br />\nmany flunked, there was no greater<br />\npercentage than formerly. The<br />\nexam was about as usual, a mathematics course not giving much<br />\nchance for variation.<br />\nDr. E. A-. Andrews, in biology,<br />\nonly has three less in his classes<br />\nthan last term. His exams were<br />\neasy, he said, and if the marks<br />\nwere arranged to form a curve<br />\nwould make one which would<br />\nnearly coincide with that for other<br />\nexams.<br />\nThough these were the first examinations which Dr. C. H. Cartilage has given in Johns Hopkins, he<br />\nfelt that they were such that the<br />\nmajority of the students of his<br />\nclasses could pass and get a good<br />\ngrade. Less than 10 per cent. of<br />\nthe men failed. Many Freshmen<br />\nin Chem 1, he felt, went below the<br />\nmark because they failed to study<br />\nfrom day to day. The difficulty in<br />\nChem 2 was lack of fundamental<br />\nknowledge. In neither case was<br />\nDr. Cartilage disappointed in the<br />\nresults nor did he think the failures excessive.<br />\nDr. W. J. A. Bliss had 20 per<br />\ncent. dropped for one reason or<br />\nother, which he did not consider a<br />\nhigh number in a course in physics.<br />\nPrevious records have shown examinations in which 52 per .cent.<br />\npassed and 48 per cent. failed. The<br />\nmid-years were a bit longer than<br />\nlast year, but not a bit harder.<br />\nQueerly enough the part which the<br />\ninstructors thQught was the easier<br />\nthe students found the most difficult.<br />\nAll over the engineering school<br />\nthe answer was the same\u2014that the<br />\ncourse has been very definitely laid<br />\nout and conducted, which necessitates an exam of very nearly the<br />\nsame type each session. In no case<br />\nhas any professor thought an ex \u2022<br />\namination hard and in few has<br />\nthere been made any definite complaint about them.

Litz, assistant instructor in English at<br />\nHopkins. The sum and substance<br />\nof this interview was that \"Professor\" Litz, as the Sun reportei<br />\ntitled him, thought the time has<br />\ncome for the establishment at Hopkins of a course offering instruction in such subjects as dancing, etiquette,\"small talk,\"thea tricals, etc. Mr. Litz, who was formerly an instructor in several coeducational schools and colleges,<br />\nsuggested that these courses might<br />\nserve as a substitute for purely<br />\nacademic training for those who<br />\nfind the present curriculum a bore<br />\nand that it might even lead to a<br />\ndegree, such as \"bachelor of society,\" which would serve to prove<br />\nthe true \"lounge-lizzard\" qualities of its possessor.<br />\nMr. Litz concluded by saying<br />\nthat he was perfectly in earnest<br />\nin his proposition, but, according<br />\n<br />\nto a subsequent article appearing<br />\nin the Evening Sun of the same<br />\nday, the matter was taken as more<br />\nor less of a joke by two of the leading educators in the city, namely,<br />\nDr. Goodnow, of Hopkins, and Dr.,<br />\nGuth, president of Goucher College. The Hopkins president said<br />\nthat he thought Mr. Litz was probably only trying to make a joke of<br />\nthe courses that are from time<br />\nto time proposed to the college,<br />\nwhile Dr. Guth, when asked<br />\nwhether he thought there was any<br />\nneed for a course in \"small talk,\"<br />\nanswered by simply saying that he<br />\nthought Mr. Litz was not to be<br />\ntaken seriously.<br />\nWhether Mr. Litz is or is not to<br />\nbe taken seriously is, of course,<br />\nstill a question\u2014one which will<br />\nprobably never be satisfactorily<br />\nanswered, regardless of its great<br />\nimportance. Whether it was meant<br />\nas? a joke or not, however, it would<br />\nseem that Mr. Litz was thoughtless, to say the least, in giving so<br />\nmuch publicity to his views which<br />\nhave evidently been the cause of<br />\nthorough disgust to those interested in the welfare of the university.<br />\nIf Mr. Litz was entirely serious<br />\nin his proposal, why, then as has<br />\nbeen asked by more then one<br />\nstudent, did he not remain at one<br />\nof the female colleges, at which he<br />\nis said to have acted as instructor,<br />\nand \"take it out\" on the fair \"coeds,\" instead of wishing to inflict<br />\nit upon the poor, inoffensive male<br />\nat Hopkins? Another suggestion<br />\nwhich has been made is that he<br />\nsubstitute \"small talk\" for \"public sleeping I,\" the only class, according to him, with which he has<br />\nnot been able to get along perfectly.<br />\nIf, on the other hand, the worthy<br />\ninstructor was attempting to be<br />\n\"funny\" at the expense of the university and its courses, he has at<br />\nthe same time attempted by ridicule to place the college in a rather<br />\nunfavorable light in the eyes of the<br />\npublic.<br />\nWith the entire student-body<br />\nand faculty making a supreme effort to place Hopkins on a firm<br />\nfoundation alongside of the other<br />\nleading institutions of the country,<br />\nit would seem rather inconsiderate<br />\nof Mr. Litz to attempt to injure<br />\nits dignity by advancing such ideas<br />\nas his on the back page of one of<br />\nthe city's leading dailies.<br />\n(Continued from page 1, col. 4)<br />\n<br />\nropean child were stressed by Dr.<br />\nLivingston Farrand, chairman of<br />\nthe Central Committee of the<br />\nAmerican Red Cross, who was the<br />\nprincipal speaker of the exercises.<br />\nDr. Farrand spoke of the depopulation of Vienna and Poland, and<br />\ngave a more optimistic picture of<br />\nconditions existing in France and<br />\nItaly at the present time.

Wilkinson Stitrs for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n<br />\nThe Varsity basket-ball team<br />\nsuffered defeat in both games of<br />\ntheir Northern trip last week.<br />\nIn the first, the game with<br />\nDrexel, on Friday night, the visiting quint suffered defeat by a 50-27<br />\nscore. Hopkins was greatly handicapped by the undersized floor,<br />\nwhich measured but 36 feet, as<br />\nmeasured by the managers of the<br />\ntwo teams. The playing was a bit<br />\nrough, several players finally being ejected for personal fouls.<br />\nIn the opening minutes of the<br />\ngame Hopkins erred in endeavoring to play the man and neglecting the ball. As a result, a good<br />\nlead was quickly mounted against<br />\nthem. Following a rally in the latter part of the first period, the<br />\nscore evened up to 13-10, but the<br />\nhalf finally ended 33-14.<br />\nThe home team had things<br />\npretty much its own way in the<br />\nsecond half, the exceptional work<br />\nof Weinberger causing the final<br />\nscore.<br />\nAccording to Coach McAvoy,<br />\nDrexel played her best game of<br />\nthe season, taking advantage of all<br />\nthe breaks.<br />\nThe game with Lehigh was a different matter.: Their team put<br />\nup a far superior brand of basketball, Hopkins players proving too<br />\ninexperienced to cope with them.<br />\nTheir floorwork and shooting was<br />\naccurate and brilliant, marked by<br />\nseveral thrilling shots and pushing the final score up to 36-16.<br />\nCaptain Donovan was the individual star, although Lingle, the\"<br />\nother forward, rivaled him for<br />\nhonors, each scoring four field<br />\ngoals.<br />\nHopkins, as usual, played its<br />\nbest in the first half, scoring nine<br />\npoints to its opponents' fourteen.<br />\nWilkinson, who substituted for<br />\nOwings in the second half, played<br />\na flashy game for the short time<br />\nhe played.<br />\nCashell was not up to his usual<br />\nstandard in the matter of shooting<br />\nfouls, caging but four out of thirteen attempts. Owings showed<br />\nimprovement in this line, being<br />\nsuccessful twice out of three tries.<br />\nFollowing the game the team<br />\nwas royally entertained by their<br />\nlate opponents at Moose Hall.<br />\n<br />\nWIN<br />\n<br />\nII III \u2022\u2022 II\u2022IN\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022 II II II MEM II II \u2022 MEM<br />\n<br />\nDefeat Lehigh 37-34 at Bethlehem.<br />\nReins Stars for Hopkins\u2014Next<br />\nMeet With Rutgers Friday<br />\nNight in Baltimore.<br />\n<br />\nIn a very closely contested and<br />\nspectacular meet at Bethlehem,<br />\nPa., last Saturday, the Johns Hopkins swimming team defeated the<br />\nLehigh representatives by the<br />\nscore of 37 to 34.<br />\nReins of Hopkins and Regad of<br />\nthe home team furnished the features of the contest, the former<br />\nwinning the back-stroke event in<br />\na very thrilling manner, finishing<br />\nout a scant two feet ahead of his<br />\nLehigh competitor, while the latter, with a plunge of 66 feet, set a<br />\nnew pool record for the Bethlehem<br />\naggregation.<br />\nHopkins started out very well<br />\nby winning the relay, but succeeded in getting only a second<br />\nplace in the plunge. Gould and<br />\nHall came out first and third, respectively, in the 220-yard swim,<br />\nand Kennady and Rowland second<br />\nand third, respectively, in :the 50yard dash. Call could win only a<br />\nthird place in the fancy-diving exhibition, while Gangewere managed to defeat both Rowland and<br />\nHall in the breast stroke. Hopkins natators, however, came back<br />\nin the last two events, Buhrer winning the 100-yard swim and Reins<br />\nthe back stroke.<br />\nHopkins is scheduled to meet<br />\nRutgers at the B. A.

The meet will be held<br />\nin the Fifth Regiment Armory,<br />\nwhich has one of the best indoor<br />\ntracks in the East. For several<br />\nweeks Mr'. Theodore Kistler, secretary of the games committee, has<br />\nbeen kept busy receiving entry<br />\nblanks from a large number of<br />\nclubs<br />\nand<br />\nschools, colleges<br />\nthroughout the East. Among<br />\nthose who will compete are some<br />\nof the best athletes in the country,<br />\nwho .will furnish plenty of entertainment for local track fans.<br />\nThe program for the evening in'eludes nine open handicap events,<br />\nfive events closed to members of<br />\nthe S. A. I. A. A. and three interscholastic handicap events. In addition to these there will be the annual 1000-yard special and a large<br />\nnumber of relay races. Yale, Syracuse and Penn State College will<br />\nmeet in a two-mile relay race that<br />\nshould furnish enough excitement<br />\nfor the most critical fan. Penn<br />\nState may also enter a mile relay<br />\nteam to run against the fast aggregation from M. I. T. Supporters<br />\nof Baltimore City College will<br />\nhave an opportunity to see the<br />\nlocal boys in a four-mile relay<br />\nevent against a team picked froni<br />\n40 Canadian high schools. A<br />\nshort time ago the City College<br />\nteam put up a game fight against<br />\nfour of the best Johns Hopkins<br />\nmilers, and showed that they will<br />\nundoubtedly give the visitors a<br />\nrun for their money. Last year<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins inaugurated<br />\nthe idea of holding annually a special 1000-yard run open only to<br />\ncolleges invited to compete. The<br />\nwinner of the race will receive a<br />\nhandsome silver cup. The colleges<br />\nwho have entered men in this event<br />\nare Georgia Tech, Lafayette, Penn<br />\nState, Delaware, Lehigh, Washington and Lee, Syracuse and University of Virginia.

D. Roosevelt Speaks:<br />\nIn speaking before the alumni at their annual banquet, held last<br />\nTuesday at the Baltimore Country Club, President Goodnow made the<br />\nwelcome announcement that the trustees will in all probability complete<br />\nthe alumni dormitory fund. Money for the purpose will be appro<br />\npriated from the bequest of William Bennett Paca, and ground will be<br />\nbroken before July 1. The fund now totals $215,000, while the cost<br />\nof the building will be about $365,000.<br />\nDr. Goodnow also praised the loyalty of the college alumni, whose<br />\ninfluence and interest in its affairs is productive of much good to the<br />\ninstitution.<br />\n, F. D. Roosevelt, the principal speaker of the evening, spoke of the<br />\nwork of college men during the war, and of their part in the future<br />\nof the country. Even before this country entered the struggle, he said,<br />\nmany college alumni were urging preparedness, while they furnished a<br />\nlarge proportion of the leadership and direction once we were in.<br />\nIt is the duty of college men, Mr. Roosevelt believes, to continue to<br />\nexercise this influence in the trying days of reconstruction which face<br />\nus. The nation will undoubtedly weather the storm of financial trouble,<br />\nbut \"it is important to remember that no nation can weather a financial<br />\nstorm if the rest of the world is allowed to go to pot.\"<br />\nDr. Charles Caspari, '96, of St. Louis, who came on especially for<br />\nthe dinner, made a plea for continued activity on the part of the Alumni<br />\nAssociation. Now that the dormitory is provided for, there is no<br />\nreason why the association should not raise funds for other buildings.<br />\n\"That is what an alumni association is for.\" In this view he was supported by George L. Radcliffe and R. Brent Keyser, who felt that the<br />\nwork should not stop.<br />\nDr. Harvey B. Stone, vice-president of the Varsity Club, made a<br />\nstatement concerning the work of the Homewood Company, the holding<br />\ncompany for athletic affairs. He believes, he said, that the greatest<br />\nneed of the University is for a gymnasium. He also announced that<br />\nthe Varsity Club was considering the establishment of several seholarships as war memorials, to be awarded not solely for scholarship, but<br />\nsomewhat on the Rhodes plan; that is, for scholarship, character, physical ability and leadership.<br />\nPreceding the dinner, the annual election of members of the Alumni<br />\nCouncil was held. The results were as follows: Council representatives, W. S. Symington for Ph.D. group; Dr. G. S. Robinson for<br />\n'M.D. group; W. W.Pagon for A.B. group, and C. W.

Goodnow, president of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nbrought out as the main point of<br />\nhis opening address the fact that<br />\nuntil greater funds are available,<br />\nlimitation of students will be necessary.<br />\n\"Where it is necessary that the<br />\nnumber of students be limited,\"<br />\nsaid President Goodnow, \"the<br />\nlimitation should be based on<br />\nmerit, merit as determined by examination, by intelligence tests as<br />\nsoon as they may be so developed<br />\nthat we can with confidence rely<br />\nupon them, and by record of performance. Above all, we should<br />\nnot retain a student as to whom<br />\nin the light of such facts as we can<br />\nsafely use we feel certain that he<br />\ncannot make good. Democracy in<br />\neducation may have its place in<br />\nthe lower schools. Perhaps it is<br />\ntrue that those schools should be<br />\nmade to fit the student, though of<br />\nthat there would appear to be<br />\nsome doubt. Higher education is,<br />\nhowever, organized to prepare for<br />\nthe professions, the qualifications<br />\nof which are definitely fixed.<br />\n\"Here there is no room, particularly in the crowded conditions we<br />\nnow face, for the student who does<br />\nnot either have the ability to justify the necessary expenditure of<br />\nmoney and effort which his training involves, or who is not willing<br />\nto make his education the serious<br />\npurpose of his life.\"<br />\nFollowing his address Dr. Goodthe annual<br />\nnow announced that '<br />\nanonymous donor of $5000 for the<br />\nfurtherance of \"art as applied to<br />\nscience\" had again donated the<br />\nsum; that James Schouler a<br />\nhad<br />\nformer Hopkins lecturer, '<br />\nawarded the University $14,000 for<br />\nlecture endowment, bringing the<br />\ntotal lecture endowment fund to<br />\n$25,000, and the late William Bennett Paca had made the University the residuary legatee of his<br />\nestate, with the expression of the<br />\nwish that the money be used for<br />\nthe building fund for the erection<br />\nof college buildings at Homewood.<br />\nThe alumni fund for the memorial dormitory has reached $215,000, Dr. Goodnow announced, and<br />\nthe work of building would be begun as soon as practicable.<br />\n(Continued on me,4, col. 2)<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, FEBRUARY 24, 1921<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nWith acknowledgments to K.

The great number<br />\nof men who failed in three subjects<br />\nand hence had to leave the university was not the result of a definite<br />\nattempt on part of the faculty to<br />\nreduce the enrollment by failing<br />\nmen, as was rumored in student<br />\ncircles two weeks ago. The university is indeed too crowded for the<br />\nlimited facilities to permit the best<br />\ninstruction in all subjects, but it<br />\nhas not undertaken such a policy<br />\nto reduce numbers. The Dean has<br />\nrepeatedly pointed out that the<br />\ntrouble lay with the lack of application or else just general worthlessness in both cases the individual lost. Several of the professors when interviewed about the<br />\nmatter were certain that the examinations they had given were<br />\neasy.<br />\nDr. L. S. Hulburt, who is head<br />\nof the undergraduate department<br />\nof mathematics and has charge of<br />\nseven sections of Math 1 and four<br />\nof Math 2, said that while a great<br /><br />\nOF<br /><br />\nFINE<br /><br />\nPIPES<br /><br />\nmany flunked, there was no greater<br />\npercentage than formerly. The<br />\nexam was about as usual, a mathematics course not giving much<br />\nchance for variation.<br />\nDr. E. A-. Andrews, in biology,<br />\nonly has three less in his classes<br />\nthan last term. His exams were<br />\neasy, he said, and if the marks<br />\nwere arranged to form a curve<br />\nwould make one which would<br />\nnearly coincide with that for other<br />\nexams.<br />\nThough these were the first examinations which Dr. C. H. Cartilage has given in Johns Hopkins, he<br />\nfelt that they were such that the<br />\nmajority of the students of his<br />\nclasses could pass and get a good<br />\ngrade. Less than 10 per cent. of<br />\nthe men failed. Many Freshmen<br />\nin Chem 1, he felt, went below the<br />\nmark because they failed to study<br />\nfrom day to day. The difficulty in<br />\nChem 2 was lack of fundamental<br />\nknowledge. In neither case was<br />\nDr. Cartilage disappointed in the<br />\nresults nor did he think the failures excessive.<br />\nDr. W. J. A. Bliss had 20 per<br />\ncent. dropped for one reason or<br />\nother, which he did not consider a<br />\nhigh number in a course in physics.<br />\nPrevious records have shown examinations in which 52 per .cent.<br />\npassed and 48 per cent. failed. The<br />\nmid-years were a bit longer than<br />\nlast year, but not a bit harder.<br />\nQueerly enough the part which the<br />\ninstructors thQught was the easier<br />\nthe students found the most difficult.<br />\nAll over the engineering school<br />\nthe answer was the same\u2014that the<br />\ncourse has been very definitely laid<br />\nout and conducted, which necessitates an exam of very nearly the<br />\nsame type each session. In no case<br />\nhas any professor thought an ex \u2022<br />\namination hard and in few has<br />\nthere been made any definite complaint about them. The students<br />\nseem to have another opinion on<br />\nthe subject.<br /><br />\nENGINEERING UNIT OF R. 0.<br />\nT. C.

Litz, assistant instructor in English at<br />\nHopkins. The sum and substance<br />\nof this interview was that \"Professor\" Litz, as the Sun reportei<br />\ntitled him, thought the time has<br />\ncome for the establishment at Hopkins of a course offering instruction in such subjects as dancing, etiquette,\"small talk,\"thea tricals, etc. Mr. Litz, who was formerly an instructor in several coeducational schools and colleges,<br />\nsuggested that these courses might<br />\nserve as a substitute for purely<br />\nacademic training for those who<br />\nfind the present curriculum a bore<br />\nand that it might even lead to a<br />\ndegree, such as \"bachelor of society,\" which would serve to prove<br />\nthe true \"lounge-lizzard\" qualities of its possessor.<br />\nMr. Litz concluded by saying<br />\nthat he was perfectly in earnest<br />\nin his proposition, but, according<br /><br />\nto a subsequent article appearing<br />\nin the Evening Sun of the same<br />\nday, the matter was taken as more<br />\nor less of a joke by two of the leading educators in the city, namely,<br />\nDr. Goodnow, of Hopkins, and Dr.,<br />\nGuth, president of Goucher College. The Hopkins president said<br />\nthat he thought Mr. Litz was probably only trying to make a joke of<br />\nthe courses that are from time<br />\nto time proposed to the college,<br />\nwhile Dr. Guth, when asked<br />\nwhether he thought there was any<br />\nneed for a course in \"small talk,\"<br />\nanswered by simply saying that he<br />\nthought Mr. Litz was not to be<br />\ntaken seriously.<br />\nWhether Mr. Litz is or is not to<br />\nbe taken seriously is, of course,<br />\nstill a question\u2014one which will<br />\nprobably never be satisfactorily<br />\nanswered, regardless of its great<br />\nimportance. Whether it was meant<br />\nas? a joke or not, however, it would<br />\nseem that Mr. Litz was thoughtless, to say the least, in giving so<br />\nmuch publicity to his views which<br />\nhave evidently been the cause of<br />\nthorough disgust to those interested in the welfare of the university.<br />\nIf Mr. Litz was entirely serious<br />\nin his proposal, why, then as has<br />\nbeen asked by more then one<br />\nstudent, did he not remain at one<br />\nof the female colleges, at which he<br />\nis said to have acted as instructor,<br />\nand \"take it out\" on the fair \"coeds,\" instead of wishing to inflict<br />\nit upon the poor, inoffensive male<br />\nat Hopkins? Another suggestion<br />\nwhich has been made is that he<br />\nsubstitute \"small talk\" for \"public sleeping I,\" the only class, according to him, with which he has<br />\nnot been able to get along perfectly.<br />\nIf, on the other hand, the worthy<br />\ninstructor was attempting to be<br />\n\"funny\" at the expense of the university and its courses, he has at<br />\nthe same time attempted by ridicule to place the college in a rather<br />\nunfavorable light in the eyes of the<br />\npublic.<br />\nWith the entire student-body<br />\nand faculty making a supreme effort to place Hopkins on a firm<br />\nfoundation alongside of the other<br />\nleading institutions of the country,<br />\nit would seem rather inconsiderate<br />\nof Mr. Litz to attempt to injure<br />\nits dignity by advancing such ideas<br />\nas his on the back page of one of<br />\nthe city's leading dailies.<br />\n(Continued from page 1, col. 4)<br /><br />\nropean child were stressed by Dr.<br />\nLivingston Farrand, chairman of<br />\nthe Central Committee of the<br />\nAmerican Red Cross, who was the<br />\nprincipal speaker of the exercises.<br />\nDr. Farrand spoke of the depopulation of Vienna and Poland, and<br />\ngave a more optimistic picture of<br />\nconditions existing in France and<br />\nItaly at the present time.

He said<br />\nthat the college is changing and<br />\nwill change as much in the future<br />\nas in the past; at present the<br />\nstandards are too lx and too<br />\nmany men that are in coJege take<br />\nno interest in their subjects. The<br />\nDean deprecated the great number<br />\nof high school subjects that are<br />\ntaught in the colleges and the high<br />\nschool methods that come with<br />\nthem; \"standards must be jacked<br />\nup in the colleges.\" He took exception to the remark printed in<br />\na Baltimore paper and ascribed to<br />\nhim that there is no, good work<br />\nbeing done at Hopkins. There is<br />\nas much fine work as ever being<br />\ndone, according to the Dean, but<br />\nthere are also more men who have<br />\nno aim or purpose in life. \"Stupidity and general worthlessness account for most failures.\" The<br />\nDean said, \"It's a curious thing,\"<br />\nbut he does not consider the recent<br />\nexaminations hard. The remark<br />\nwas greeted with mingled emotion<br />\nby the student-body, which evidently did not share this view.<br />\nThe Dean said that he was reviewing all \"doubtful cases\" of<br />\nmen who are on the border line of<br />\ndismissal from the university. No<br />\nman who was dropped will be reinstated unless he can produce a<br />\nconvincing reason for his readmission.<br />\nWORK ON PLAY IN FINAL STAGE.<br /><br />\nThe Dramatic Club has reached<br />\nthe final stage of preparation for<br />\nthe play since the actors have<br />\nall completed the memorizing of<br />\ntheir lines.

Final Counts 50 to 27<br />\nand 36 to 16. Wilkinson Stitrs for<br />\nHopkins.<br /><br />\nThe Varsity basket-ball team<br />\nsuffered defeat in both games of<br />\ntheir Northern trip last week.<br />\nIn the first, the game with<br />\nDrexel, on Friday night, the visiting quint suffered defeat by a 50-27<br />\nscore. Hopkins was greatly handicapped by the undersized floor,<br />\nwhich measured but 36 feet, as<br />\nmeasured by the managers of the<br />\ntwo teams. The playing was a bit<br />\nrough, several players finally being ejected for personal fouls.<br />\nIn the opening minutes of the<br />\ngame Hopkins erred in endeavoring to play the man and neglecting the ball. As a result, a good<br />\nlead was quickly mounted against<br />\nthem. Following a rally in the latter part of the first period, the<br />\nscore evened up to 13-10, but the<br />\nhalf finally ended 33-14.<br />\nThe home team had things<br />\npretty much its own way in the<br />\nsecond half, the exceptional work<br />\nof Weinberger causing the final<br />\nscore.<br />\nAccording to Coach McAvoy,<br />\nDrexel played her best game of<br />\nthe season, taking advantage of all<br />\nthe breaks.<br />\nThe game with Lehigh was a different matter.: Their team put<br />\nup a far superior brand of basketball, Hopkins players proving too<br />\ninexperienced to cope with them.<br />\nTheir floorwork and shooting was<br />\naccurate and brilliant, marked by<br />\nseveral thrilling shots and pushing the final score up to 36-16.<br />\nCaptain Donovan was the individual star, although Lingle, the\"<br />\nother forward, rivaled him for<br />\nhonors, each scoring four field<br />\ngoals.<br />\nHopkins, as usual, played its<br />\nbest in the first half, scoring nine<br />\npoints to its opponents' fourteen.<br />\nWilkinson, who substituted for<br />\nOwings in the second half, played<br />\na flashy game for the short time<br />\nhe played.<br />\nCashell was not up to his usual<br />\nstandard in the matter of shooting<br />\nfouls, caging but four out of thirteen attempts. Owings showed<br />\nimprovement in this line, being<br />\nsuccessful twice out of three tries.<br />\nFollowing the game the team<br />\nwas royally entertained by their<br />\nlate opponents at Moose Hall.<br /><br />\nWIN<br /><br />\nII III \u2022\u2022 II\u2022IN\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022 II II II MEM II II \u2022 MEM<br /><br />\nDefeat Lehigh 37-34 at Bethlehem.<br />\nReins Stars for Hopkins\u2014Next<br />\nMeet With Rutgers Friday<br />\nNight in Baltimore.<br /><br />\nIn a very closely contested and<br />\nspectacular meet at Bethlehem,<br />\nPa., last Saturday, the Johns Hopkins swimming team defeated the<br />\nLehigh representatives by the<br />\nscore of 37 to 34.<br />\nReins of Hopkins and Regad of<br />\nthe home team furnished the features of the contest, the former<br />\nwinning the back-stroke event in<br />\na very thrilling manner, finishing<br />\nout a scant two feet ahead of his<br />\nLehigh competitor, while the latter, with a plunge of 66 feet, set a<br />\nnew pool record for the Bethlehem<br />\naggregation.<br />\nHopkins started out very well<br />\nby winning the relay, but succeeded in getting only a second<br />\nplace in the plunge. Gould and<br />\nHall came out first and third, respectively, in the 220-yard swim,<br />\nand Kennady and Rowland second<br />\nand third, respectively, in :the 50yard dash. Call could win only a<br />\nthird place in the fancy-diving exhibition, while Gangewere managed to defeat both Rowland and<br />\nHall in the breast stroke. Hopkins natators, however, came back<br />\nin the last two events, Buhrer winning the 100-yard swim and Reins<br />\nthe back stroke.<br />\nHopkins is scheduled to meet<br />\nRutgers at the B. A.
