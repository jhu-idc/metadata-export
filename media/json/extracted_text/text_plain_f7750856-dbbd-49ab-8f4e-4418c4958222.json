Then the mops were<br />\ntested in places where they would<br />\nget the hardest usage\u2014railroad stations, for example.<br />\nThe mops performed so well that<br />\nDu Pont built a Pilot plant near<br />\nBuffalo and, under a license from<br />\nthe man who had the original idea,<br />\nmanufactured the yarn on a small<br />\nscale. Only after three years of study<br />\nand testinr was Du Pont able to<br />\n<br />\nMops made with cellulose sponge<br />\nyarn pick up and retain so much<br />\nwater they need wringing less often.<br />\nYou can mop a floor with them in<br />\nfar less time than it formerly took.<br />\nThey dry quickly,leave no /hit.They<br />\noutwear other mops three to five<br />\ntimes.

It often leaves a trail of<br />\nlint. And it wears out fast. A man<br />\nwho sold yarn to mop manufacturers<br />\ndecided to do something a_bout these<br />\nnuisances. Perhaps some reinforcing<br />\nmaterial might be combined with the<br />\nyarn.He did some experimental work<br />\nof his'own but more and more he<br />\nwondered if it might be pos,sible to<br />\nuse a cellulose sponge coating.<br />\nTHREE YEARS OF RESEARCH<br /><br />\nSo the man called on Du Pont, the<br />\ncompany that had introduced the<br />\ncellulose sponge to America in 1936.<br />\nThe suggestion of a sponge yarn presented a challengi4 problem.<br />\nSome way woOld have to be found<br />\nto extrude a tightly fitting cellulose<br />\nsponge jacket around each strand of<br /><br />\nthe yarn. The whole sponge process<br />\nwould have to be adjusted for use<br />\nin an especially designed machine.<br />\nDu Pont chemists and engineers<br />\ntackled these problems.<br />\nEven the very first cellulose sponge<br />\nyarn produced experimentally made<br />\nmops that were strong, absorbent<br />\nand durable. But the process had to<br />\nbe changed and-improved time and<br />\ntime again. Then the mops were<br />\ntested in places where they would<br />\nget the hardest usage\u2014railroad stations, for example.<br />\nThe mops performed so well that<br />\nDu Pont built a Pilot plant near<br />\nBuffalo and, under a license from<br />\nthe man who had the original idea,<br />\nmanufactured the yarn on a small<br />\nscale. Only after three years of study<br />\nand testinr was Du Pont able to<br /><br />\nMops made with cellulose sponge<br />\nyarn pick up and retain so much<br />\nwater they need wringing less often.<br />\nYou can mop a floor with them in<br />\nfar less time than it formerly took.<br />\nThey dry quickly,leave no /hit.They<br />\noutwear other mops three to five<br />\ntimes. Best of all, perhaps, they stay<br />\ndirt-free longer than ordinary mops.<br />\nHere is something women will appreciate \u2014 a clean mop!<br />\nThe introduction of these new<br />\ncleaning tools is another example of<br />\nhow,business firms of all sizes depend<br />\non each other. The Du Pont Company had facilities for specialized research on cellulose sponge. Because<br />\nDu Pont could supply sponge yarn<br />\neconomically,some twenty mop manufacturers today have a better product that saves maintenance people<br />\nand the American housewife time,<br />\nlabor and money.<br />\n* * *<br />\nSEND FOR \"The Story of Cellulose,\" a 43.<br />\npage booklet that tells how wood and cotton<br />\nare transformed into sponges, textile fibers,<br />\nlacquers, plastics,coated fabrics, Cellophane<br />\nand many other useful productd.
