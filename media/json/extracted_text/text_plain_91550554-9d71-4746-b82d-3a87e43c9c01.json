Lack of space, unfortunately, prevents us from publishing a more detailed report, but from<br />\nall accounts the advantages of having such a council is unquestionable. The accounts are in excellent<br />\nshape and are accurately kept<br />\nthrough the centralized form of<br />\nbookkeeping adopted. Bills are<br />\npromptly paid, and a check is kept<br />\non each activity, which prevents it<br />\nfrom exceeding its budget. The<br />\n'only activity in difficulty at present<br />\nis the Blue Jay, which had a deficit<br />\nof some three hundred and fifty<br />\ndollars from last year to meet this<br />\nfall. It is thought, however, that<br />\nwith economy and hard work it<br />\nwill be possible to make up this deficit by next year. The deficit last<br />\nFebruary was over five hundred<br />\ndollars, two hundred of which was<br />\nmade up in the last two issues of<br />\nlast spring. Other activities which<br />\n<br />\nTHE SWIMMING TEAM<br />\n<br />\nThe Swimming Team needs $90,<br />\nto carry out its season, and it has<br />\nasked the students to support them<br />\nto that extent. Instead of asking<br />\nfor contributions at a mass-meeting, however, it has planned a<br />\ndance to be given after its principal meet. We do not believe that<br />\nthere is any danger of the students<br />\nfailing to furnish the required support.

The future of the<br />\nswimming team depends upon the<br />\ndisposal of these tickets.

E. Hall<br />\non Wednesday night, December 21,<br />\n1921. The dancing began at 9.00<br />\nP. M. to the jazzy strains of Lou<br />\nFisher's orchestra. The chaperons<br />\nin attendance were Dr. and Airs.<br />\nJohn H. Latane, Dr. and Mrs. J.<br />\nB. Whitehead, and Dr. and Mrs.<br />\nRonald T. Abercrombie. The assembly hall was tastefully decorated with holly and woodland<br />\ngreens.<br />\nThe programs were useful as<br />\nwell as ornamental. The dance<br />\ncards were enclosed in neat black<br />\nleather wallets bearing the University Seal stamped thereupon in<br />\ngold. Two of these unique souvenirs were furnished to each couple. The hall was comfortably<br />\nfilled with dancers, but was not<br />\novercrowded, as has been the<br />\ncase in former years.

CHARLES ST.<br />\n<br />\nCharles E.Skinner<br />\nHAT is insulation?\u2014a necessary evil;\u2014<br />\nthe insulation engineer?\u2014likewise a necW<br />\nesarsy evil;\u2014such, too often, was the oldtime<br />\nformula. What wonder, with such a stigma,<br />\nthat the vast majority of budding engineers of<br />\nbygone years side-stepped that branch of the<br />\nelectrical art which was in such ill-repute.<br />\nFortunately, a few far-visioned young men of<br />\nunusual caliber saw the great possibilities in this<br />\nfield of endeavor and concentrated many of their<br />\nbest years upon it. Foremost among these few<br />\nwho have developed the insulation problem to a<br />\nleading position in the art,stands Charles E.Skinner, the head of the Research Department of the<br />\nWestinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co.<br />\nFor over thirty years, Mr. Skinner has been<br />\ndelving into the whys and wherefores of the insulation problem, from extreme theoretical studies<br />\nto the most practical applications. His work<br />\nbegan at a time when there were no theories<br />\nworth while to consider, and when there were no<br />\nmethods worth while to work with. It was not<br />\nonly necessary to develop the insulation art from<br />\nthe ground up, but all the tools of attack had to<br />\nbe developed, and this latter means far more<br />\nthan mere words can convey.<br />\n<br />\nAs an insulation engineer, Mr. Skinner has<br />\nalways faced the necessity of utilizing a great<br />\narray of materials which are inferior in mechanical characteristics to those of the rest of the structure, such as papers,fibers, cottons,fabrics, mica,<br />\nvarnishes, asphaltums,.oils, and various other unmechanical materials. Such materials are practically all affected, or destroyed, by undue heat.<br />\nMany of them are easily penetrated by moisture,<br />\nthe arch enemy of insulation. Practically none of<br />\nthese mateiials individually is ideal for the purpose desired, nor are they perfect in combination.<br />\nConsequently, the history of insulation is a story<br />\nof struggle, of frequent disappointment, and ofttimes mysterious failure.<br />\nIt is now fully realized that the insulation<br />\nengineer is a vital and constructive factor in the<br />\ndevelopment of the electrical art. With the<br />\ngreat advances in recent years his high position<br />\nin the art is becoming more and more recognized, as the difficulties of his problems are<br />\nbetter realized. It may be said truly, that the<br />\nhigh position of the Westinghouse Company is<br />\ndue, to a large extent, to the far reaching accomplishments of its insulation engineers, of<br />\nwhom Mr. Skinner is the leading exponent.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "VOL.

Lack of space, unfortunately, prevents us from publishing a more detailed report, but from<br />\nall accounts the advantages of having such a council is unquestionable. The accounts are in excellent<br />\nshape and are accurately kept<br />\nthrough the centralized form of<br />\nbookkeeping adopted. Bills are<br />\npromptly paid, and a check is kept<br />\non each activity, which prevents it<br />\nfrom exceeding its budget. The<br />\n'only activity in difficulty at present<br />\nis the Blue Jay, which had a deficit<br />\nof some three hundred and fifty<br />\ndollars from last year to meet this<br />\nfall. It is thought, however, that<br />\nwith economy and hard work it<br />\nwill be possible to make up this deficit by next year. The deficit last<br />\nFebruary was over five hundred<br />\ndollars, two hundred of which was<br />\nmade up in the last two issues of<br />\nlast spring.

Instead of asking<br />\nfor contributions at a mass-meeting, however, it has planned a<br />\ndance to be given after its principal meet. We do not believe that<br />\nthere is any danger of the students<br />\nfailing to furnish the required support.

The chaperons<br />\nin attendance were Dr. and Airs.<br />\nJohn H. Latane, Dr. and Mrs. J.<br />\nB. Whitehead, and Dr. and Mrs.<br />\nRonald T. Abercrombie. The assembly hall was tastefully decorated with holly and woodland<br />\ngreens.<br />\nThe programs were useful as<br />\nwell as ornamental. The dance<br />\ncards were enclosed in neat black<br />\nleather wallets bearing the University Seal stamped thereupon in<br />\ngold. Two of these unique souvenirs were furnished to each couple. The hall was comfortably<br />\nfilled with dancers, but was not<br />\novercrowded, as has been the<br />\ncase in former years. On the blackboard, situated at the east end of<br />\nthe hall, the various football scores<br />\nof the past season were combined<br />\nin a cleverly executed design. On<br />\naccount of the closeness of the<br />\nChristmas vacation, joy and mirth<br />\nwere unbounded, and the entire assemblage seemed to be absolutely<br />\ncarefree.

CHARLES ST.<br /><br />\nCharles E.Skinner<br />\nHAT is insulation?\u2014a necessary evil;\u2014<br />\nthe insulation engineer?\u2014likewise a necW<br />\nesarsy evil;\u2014such, too often, was the oldtime<br />\nformula. What wonder, with such a stigma,<br />\nthat the vast majority of budding engineers of<br />\nbygone years side-stepped that branch of the<br />\nelectrical art which was in such ill-repute.<br />\nFortunately, a few far-visioned young men of<br />\nunusual caliber saw the great possibilities in this<br />\nfield of endeavor and concentrated many of their<br />\nbest years upon it. Foremost among these few<br />\nwho have developed the insulation problem to a<br />\nleading position in the art,stands Charles E.Skinner, the head of the Research Department of the<br />\nWestinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Co.<br />\nFor over thirty years, Mr. Skinner has been<br />\ndelving into the whys and wherefores of the insulation problem, from extreme theoretical studies<br />\nto the most practical applications. His work<br />\nbegan at a time when there were no theories<br />\nworth while to consider, and when there were no<br />\nmethods worth while to work with. It was not<br />\nonly necessary to develop the insulation art from<br />\nthe ground up, but all the tools of attack had to<br />\nbe developed, and this latter means far more<br />\nthan mere words can convey.<br /><br />\nAs an insulation engineer, Mr. Skinner has<br />\nalways faced the necessity of utilizing a great<br />\narray of materials which are inferior in mechanical characteristics to those of the rest of the structure, such as papers,fibers, cottons,fabrics, mica,<br />\nvarnishes, asphaltums,.oils, and various other unmechanical materials. Such materials are practically all affected, or destroyed, by undue heat.<br />\nMany of them are easily penetrated by moisture,<br />\nthe arch enemy of insulation. Practically none of<br />\nthese mateiials individually is ideal for the purpose desired, nor are they perfect in combination.<br />\nConsequently, the history of insulation is a story<br />\nof struggle, of frequent disappointment, and ofttimes mysterious failure.<br />\nIt is now fully realized that the insulation<br />\nengineer is a vital and constructive factor in the<br />\ndevelopment of the electrical art. With the<br />\ngreat advances in recent years his high position<br />\nin the art is becoming more and more recognized, as the difficulties of his problems are<br />\nbetter realized. It may be said truly, that the<br />\nhigh position of the Westinghouse Company is<br />\ndue, to a large extent, to the far reaching accomplishments of its insulation engineers, of<br />\nwhom Mr. Skinner is the leading exponent.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 37573, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "c8b119cc-4e1d-4404-9e8f-7dfad0ec1cd9", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/12976-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 12976, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "9caf1f9d-f182-4753-8bda-d19d5c416bee", "url": "/node/12976"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "c24b215b-2cb2-45b7-9352-50c725343a78"}]}
