That is, they will try.<br />\nto beat Swarthmore College at the manly game of football. The<br />\njinx that the Phillie squad has held over the varsity has-been so<br />\ngreat that it takes a much longer memory than this writer owns<br />\nto recall the last Jay victory. However, this is a new frosh team<br />\nander a spanking new\u2014and good\u2014system and they hope to turn<br />\nback the J V edition of the Garnet eleven, jinx or no jinx.<br />\nSYSTEM'S TEST OF FIRE<br />\nThis will actually be the first real test of the new Hopkins<br />\nFreshman sports program, a system that is designed to introduce<br />\nthe green freshman to the rigors of college competition in a slow<br />\nand methodical fashion. Against the Swarthmore J V, the Hopkins<br />\nAthletic Department will have a chalice to see how their slowly<br />\nput-together team reacts to one that has had the pressure of a<br />\nfull schedule and the necessity of playing games early in the<br />\nseason. Frosh Director Marshall Turner doesn't know the answer<br />\nto this one but he has got the answer to a lot of other questions<br />\nthat have bothered him ever since he began college coathihg.<br />\n,Turner, when discussing his baby-project, leans back in his<br />\nOiair and becomes almost lyrical. He explains, and explains convincingly, that he has more boys out than he ever expected, (they<br />\nprepared for 40 and got 76), spirit is high, there is all the hustle<br />\nhi the world, attendance is very good and almost nobody has just<br />\ndropped off the squad. It sounds good and it is good.<br />\nMAYBE THEY'LL STAY 4 YEARS<br />\nBut the most important fact of this program is one that won't<br />\nfully<br />\ntested until the marks roll in around February and<br />\nbe<br />\nJune. The modified Frost' program was set up to give athletics<br />\nto raw colregians in doses that they could handle. The mortality<br />\nrate in the freshman year was to be cut. This was in order to<br />\nsave athletes for the varsity since statistics have shown that a boy<br />\nwho finishes his first year of college has an odds-on chance of<br />\ngetting that final piece of paper.<br />\nBut a modified program does not mean that the Frosh are<br />\ngetting left. They have good coaching and are working the same<br />\nwinged T that the varsity has found so effective. By next year<br />\nthey will be able to move up into varsity slots and Marsh Turnet<br />\nexpects a good bit of his line material to do just that. But firs<br />\ncomes the Swarthmore jinx.<br />\n<br />\nAs the opening game date<br />\ndraws near, freshman football<br />\ncoach Marshall Turner, has decided on a starting backfield alignment. Much of last week's practice time was devoted to scrimmage, while the feature of the<br />\ncoming week's drills will be a<br />\npractice game with the varsity<br />\nsecond-stringers.<br />\n<br />\nthe Jay soccer team<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\npa<br />\n<br />\nTowson State Teachers' College<br />\nfOr a 3:30 game.

That is, they will try.<br />\nto beat Swarthmore College at the manly game of football. The<br />\njinx that the Phillie squad has held over the varsity has-been so<br />\ngreat that it takes a much longer memory than this writer owns<br />\nto recall the last Jay victory. However, this is a new frosh team<br />\nander a spanking new\u2014and good\u2014system and they hope to turn<br />\nback the J V edition of the Garnet eleven, jinx or no jinx.<br />\nSYSTEM'S TEST OF FIRE<br />\nThis will actually be the first real test of the new Hopkins<br />\nFreshman sports program, a system that is designed to introduce<br />\nthe green freshman to the rigors of college competition in a slow<br />\nand methodical fashion. Against the Swarthmore J V, the Hopkins<br />\nAthletic Department will have a chalice to see how their slowly<br />\nput-together team reacts to one that has had the pressure of a<br />\nfull schedule and the necessity of playing games early in the<br />\nseason. Frosh Director Marshall Turner doesn't know the answer<br />\nto this one but he has got the answer to a lot of other questions<br />\nthat have bothered him ever since he began college coathihg.<br />\n,Turner, when discussing his baby-project, leans back in his<br />\nOiair and becomes almost lyrical. He explains, and explains convincingly, that he has more boys out than he ever expected, (they<br />\nprepared for 40 and got 76), spirit is high, there is all the hustle<br />\nhi the world, attendance is very good and almost nobody has just<br />\ndropped off the squad. It sounds good and it is good.<br />\nMAYBE THEY'LL STAY 4 YEARS<br />\nBut the most important fact of this program is one that won't<br />\nfully<br />\ntested until the marks roll in around February and<br />\nbe<br />\nJune. The modified Frost' program was set up to give athletics<br />\nto raw colregians in doses that they could handle. The mortality<br />\nrate in the freshman year was to be cut. This was in order to<br />\nsave athletes for the varsity since statistics have shown that a boy<br />\nwho finishes his first year of college has an odds-on chance of<br />\ngetting that final piece of paper.<br />\nBut a modified program does not mean that the Frosh are<br />\ngetting left. They have good coaching and are working the same<br />\nwinged T that the varsity has found so effective. By next year<br />\nthey will be able to move up into varsity slots and Marsh Turnet<br />\nexpects a good bit of his line material to do just that. But firs<br />\ncomes the Swarthmore jinx.<br /><br />\nAs the opening game date<br />\ndraws near, freshman football<br />\ncoach Marshall Turner, has decided on a starting backfield alignment. Much of last week's practice time was devoted to scrimmage, while the feature of the<br />\ncoming week's drills will be a<br />\npractice game with the varsity<br />\nsecond-stringers.<br /><br />\nthe Jay soccer team<br /><br />\ni<br />\npa<br /><br />\nTowson State Teachers' College<br />\nfOr a 3:30 game.
