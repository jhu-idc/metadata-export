To<br />\nsign the contract now would be to<br />\nprofessionalize himself and would<br />\nrender him ineligible for the Harvard baseball team, for which he<br />\nintends to become a candidate.<br />\nBrickley is going to try for one of<br />\nthe outfield positions on the Harvard nine. This will be his first<br />\nattempt at baseball since he has<br />\nbeen at Harvard, although at \"prep\"<br />\nschool he captained a championship<br />\nteam.<br />\nBrickley's advent to Baltimore is<br />\nbeing much looked forward to, not<br />\nonly by all members of the University, but by all Baltimore people<br />\nwho are interested in football. As<br />\nhas been before pointed out, the<br />\nvalue to Hopkins of obtaining a<br />\nman of his calibre as coach can<br />\nhardly be overestimated as far as<br />\nthe development of a football team<br />\nis concerned. Much interest has already been shown in the fact that<br />\nhe is to come here, and it is safe<br />\nto say that at the time of his actual<br />\nreporting for duty the Black and<br />\nBlue team will be watched by more<br />\npeople and with more interest than<br />\nit has at any stage of the history<br />\nof football at this University.<br />\nBrickley will come to Baltimore<br />\nat some time in the near future for<br />\nthe purpose of speaking to the students and getting a line on conditions as they now are. It is expected that a mass-meeting will be<br />\nheld, at which a reception will be<br />\ntendered the famous athlete by the<br />\nstudents.

These<br />\nservices were attended by President<br />\nGoodnow of Hopkins and by over<br />\nforty students representing every<br />\nclass at the University; the larger<br />\nnumber, however, being former<br />\nclassmates of the little player. There<br />\nwere also representatives from Lehigh, and from the Friends School<br />\nof Wilmington, which Layfield had<br />\nattended before entering Hopkins.<br />\nFour of the pallbearers were Paul<br />\nWilkinson and Allen Voshell, captain and manager, respectively, of<br />\nlast season's football team; Frank<br />\nSutton, president of the freshman<br />\nclass, and Edgar K. Pfitsch, a close<br />\nfriend of Layfield's when the latter<br />\nwas at the University. The presence at the funeral of President<br />\nTroxell and Graduate Manager<br />\nDorsey of the Athletic Association,<br />\nand the floral tributes sent by that<br />\norganization and by the several<br />\nclasses, were further testimonials of<br />\nthe profound and sincere regret that<br />\nis generally felt at the loss of the<br />\nplucky little athlete.<br />\nThe news of Layfield's death,<br />\nwhich reached Hopkins by means<br />\nof a telegram sent to Dr. Ronald<br />\nAbercrombie by the physician in<br />\nattendance on the injured man,<br />\ncame as a distinct shock to the student body, which had been led by<br />\nthe player's plucky fight for life to<br />\nhope for his recovery, in spite of<br />\nthe opinion of his medical advisers<br />\nthat such an event was well-nigh<br />\nimpossible.

The absence of the little group of lowerclass men who furnished an amusing cabaret feature at the sophomore banquet of the 1916 Class<br />\nwas of course felt keenly by all of<br />\nthe juniors, but every man present<br />\nco-operated with the speakers to<br />\nmake their loss as negligible a quantity as possible.<br />\nJohn C.

The third address<br />\nwas given by Hiram W. Woodward, who ably covered the work<br />\nbeing done by the members of the<br />\nclass enrolled in the Technical<br />\nSchool. Thomas J.

The<br />\nhighly courageous manner in which<br />\nhe kept up his manful fight against<br />\nconstantly menacing death, and<br />\nthe seemingly strengthening effect<br />\nwhich it produced on his general<br />\ncondition, had led many to hope<br />\nagainst hope that he might recover<br />\nthe so highly deserved good health<br />\nfor which he had striven in vain, and<br />\nwhen the news that he had finally<br />\nsuccumbed came it made it all the<br />\nharder to realize that his fight had<br />\nbeen lost. The wonderful grit<br />\nand stamnia which he manifested,<br />\ncoupled with his unquenchable optimism,'enade him loved not only by<br />\nhis fellow students, but by all to<br />\nwhom news of his struggle came.<br />\nThere is a most timely lesson to<br />\nbe drawn from the death of this<br />\nyoung hero. In the spectacle of<br />\nLayfield, living on in face of surely<br />\napproaching death with a courageous optimism and a determined will<br />\nworthy of being designated as almost superhuman, we see an example of what one person has been<br />\nable to do under the most adverse<br />\ncircumstances imaginable, and cannot help feeling that there is much<br />\nto be drawn from thought over the<br />\nmatter. Layfield has shown us<br />\nmuch which makes us ashamed of<br />\nourselves, yet which makes us feel<br />\nsadly proud that he was a Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nman, and which makes us hope that<br />\nhe may serve as a model for the<br />\nHopkins men who have been more<br />\nfortunate than he has.<br />\nThe feeling of grief which is<br />\nshared by all the students of the<br />\nUniversity over the tragic culmination of the play in the Lehigh game<br />\nlast October is made a very individual and personal one by several<br />\ncircumstances accompanying the<br />\ncase. Johns Hopkins is, first of all,<br />\na small institution and there is consequently every opportunity for undergraduates to become acquainted.<br />\nAnd thus, although Layfield had<br />\nbeen at the University only three<br />\nweeks, he was already more than a<br />\nname to a large number of the students\u2014a condition that would have<br />\nbeen practically impossible in a college with a larger undergraduate<br />\nenrollment; secondly, it was the<br />\nfirst fatal accident to occur at Hopkins as a result of indulgence in<br />\nathletic activities\u2014the former history of the various teams having<br />\nbeen singularly free from serious<br />\ninjuries to players; lastly, and by<br />\nodds most important of all, Bob's<br />\nwonderful struggle against the<br />\ndeath which everyone else feared<br />\nwas inevitable, the splendid pluck<br />\nthat enabled him to smile through<br />\nall his pain and persist in his intention to \"play again,\" and the undaunted spirit that led him to ask<br />\nthat all the games on the football<br />\nschedule should be played out even<br />\nin the event of his death before the<br />\nclose of the season, were contributing circumstances that brought his<br />\ncase home very closely to every<br />\nHopkins man and made him loved<br />\neven by those who had barely<br />\nlearned to know him. Hence it is<br />\nthat Layfield's death is not vaguely<br />\nregarded as a general calamity, but<br />\nis keenly felt as a deep and personal<br />\nloss.<br />\nPerhaps one more reason should<br />\nbe given for the wide sympathy expressed for the heroic little quarterback. During his long period of<br />\nsuffering, Layfield by no means lost<br />\ninterest in what was occurring at the<br />\nUniversity, but kept in the closest<br />\npossible touch with all its activities<br />\nwhile he was, as he himself felt,<br />\ntemporarily \"out of things.\" He<br />\nwas particularly concerned over the<br />\nfootball games still to be played,<br />\nand was very anxious that the<br />\nwearers of the Black and Blue<br />\nmight emerge victorious from their<br />\ngridiron encounter with the representatives of St. John's. And he<br />\nkept to the very last, as his chiefest<br />\ntreasure, the 'Varsity sweater with<br />\nits coveted \"H\" that had been presented to him by a special action<br />\nof the Athletic Board.<br />\nLayfield is dead, but his heroism<br />\nwill not soon be forgotten. All who<br />\nwatched the brave fight for life of<br />\nthe little freshman, paralyzed from<br />\nthe neck down, completely encased<br />\nin a plaster cast, but continuing to<br />\nstruggle and to hope until long<br />\nperiods of unconsciousness robbed<br />\nhim of his will, were deeply and<br />\npermanently impressed and affected.<br />\nAction with regard to the perpetuation of his name in the his-<br />\n<br />\nSWIMMING MEET<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS INDEPENDENTS<br />\nVS.<br />\n<br />\nPRINCETON<br />\nSATURDAY, MARCH 13.

The gymnasium is not<br />\nto contain a swimming pool, and<br />\nthe students are agitating for the<br />\naddition of this feature. The Executive Committee of the student<br />\nbody has already voted $1,500 toward the construction of a pool. A<br />\ngymnasium for the use of the women students will also be constructed.<br />\n<br />\nThe Glee and Instrumental Clubs<br />\ngave a concert last Tuesday night<br />\nat the Franklin Square Baptist<br />\nChurch of this city. The usual<br />\nprogram was rendered and the soloists and quartet received unusual<br />\napplause. After the concert, the<br />\nmusicians were served refreshments.<br />\nThe concert was a success from<br />\nevery angle, and as such, carries<br />\nforward the steady advance in quality of the performances given to<br />\ndate. That this advance indicates<br />\nreal work on the part of the Hopkins musicians, ,is obvious. Every<br />\nmember of the Clubs is showing an<br />\ninterest which is making this year's<br />\nMusical Clubs at least a rival of any<br />\nof those of previous years.<br />\nThat the management is not satisfied even with the marked successes so far, is shown by the fact<br />\nthat the repertoire is being increased along both vocal and instrumental lines. A mandolin club<br />\nhas been organized and promises<br />\nto prove a very attractive feature<br />\non future programs. The Glee<br />\nClub, under the direction of Leader<br />\nSpieker, starts in this week rehearsing new selections. Ultimately, the<br />\nmanagement hopes to have a repertoire such that programs may be<br />\nvaried to suit their patrons.<br />\nThe next concert will be given<br />\nnext Tuesday at Catonsville. Arrangements are being made for a<br />\ntrip to Tome Institute, and although<br />\nthe date has not been decided upon,<br />\nthe trip will most likely be taken<br />\nin the near future before the Easter<br />\nexaminations. The Glee Club has<br />\nbeen invited to render a few selections at the next faculty dance on<br />\nthe twenty-second of this month.<br />\nThe invitation, which has been accepted, is truly appreciated, since<br />\nit indicates an unusual interest and<br />\nsupport of the faculty in the musical activity at Hopkins.<br />\nPreparations are being made for<br />\na trip through Western Maryland<br />\nand West Virginia, to be taken during the Easter vacation, and a trip<br />\nto Cambridge will probably be<br />\nscheduled at a later date. The<br />\nmanagement is this year working<br />\nhard to take advantage of all possible opportunity to advertise Johns<br />\nT-Topkins, both in and about Baltimore and throughout more extensive areas. The work of the clubs<br />\nhas thus far proven entirely worthy<br />\nof being set forth as representative<br />\nof Johns Hopkins, and in view of<br />\nthe fact that all concerned are still<br />\nworking hard to attain to a still<br />\nhigher standard, there seems to be<br />\n\u2022 some promise of the performance<br />\nof a service of no mean value to<br />\nthe university.<br />\n<br />\nWANTED!<br />\nGuitar, Banjo and Mandolin Players<br />\n<br />\nSEE<br />\n<br />\nW.

To<br />\nsign the contract now would be to<br />\nprofessionalize himself and would<br />\nrender him ineligible for the Harvard baseball team, for which he<br />\nintends to become a candidate.<br />\nBrickley is going to try for one of<br />\nthe outfield positions on the Harvard nine. This will be his first<br />\nattempt at baseball since he has<br />\nbeen at Harvard, although at \"prep\"<br />\nschool he captained a championship<br />\nteam.<br />\nBrickley's advent to Baltimore is<br />\nbeing much looked forward to, not<br />\nonly by all members of the University, but by all Baltimore people<br />\nwho are interested in football. As<br />\nhas been before pointed out, the<br />\nvalue to Hopkins of obtaining a<br />\nman of his calibre as coach can<br />\nhardly be overestimated as far as<br />\nthe development of a football team<br />\nis concerned. Much interest has already been shown in the fact that<br />\nhe is to come here, and it is safe<br />\nto say that at the time of his actual<br />\nreporting for duty the Black and<br />\nBlue team will be watched by more<br />\npeople and with more interest than<br />\nit has at any stage of the history<br />\nof football at this University.<br />\nBrickley will come to Baltimore<br />\nat some time in the near future for<br />\nthe purpose of speaking to the students and getting a line on conditions as they now are. It is expected that a mass-meeting will be<br />\nheld, at which a reception will be<br />\ntendered the famous athlete by the<br />\nstudents. Much enthusiasm has<br />\nbeen stirred up over the matter and<br />\nthese is little doubt as to the warmth<br />\nof Brickley's reception.<br />\nAt the time of his taking up residence in this city next fall he will<br />\nenter into connection with a local<br />\nbusiness firm.

These<br />\nservices were attended by President<br />\nGoodnow of Hopkins and by over<br />\nforty students representing every<br />\nclass at the University; the larger<br />\nnumber, however, being former<br />\nclassmates of the little player. There<br />\nwere also representatives from Lehigh, and from the Friends School<br />\nof Wilmington, which Layfield had<br />\nattended before entering Hopkins.<br />\nFour of the pallbearers were Paul<br />\nWilkinson and Allen Voshell, captain and manager, respectively, of<br />\nlast season's football team; Frank<br />\nSutton, president of the freshman<br />\nclass, and Edgar K. Pfitsch, a close<br />\nfriend of Layfield's when the latter<br />\nwas at the University. The presence at the funeral of President<br />\nTroxell and Graduate Manager<br />\nDorsey of the Athletic Association,<br />\nand the floral tributes sent by that<br />\norganization and by the several<br />\nclasses, were further testimonials of<br />\nthe profound and sincere regret that<br />\nis generally felt at the loss of the<br />\nplucky little athlete.<br />\nThe news of Layfield's death,<br />\nwhich reached Hopkins by means<br />\nof a telegram sent to Dr. Ronald<br />\nAbercrombie by the physician in<br />\nattendance on the injured man,<br />\ncame as a distinct shock to the student body, which had been led by<br />\nthe player's plucky fight for life to<br />\nhope for his recovery, in spite of<br />\nthe opinion of his medical advisers<br />\nthat such an event was well-nigh<br />\nimpossible.

To<br />\nthe privilege of freedom from hazing and the distinction of ability to<br />\nenter various 'Varsity competitions<br />\nhitherto open only to upperclass men<br />\nhas been added the inexpressible<br />\ndelight of swaying and trotting<br />\nblithely about the gymnasium three<br />\ntimes a week to the blaring but welcome accompaniment of a raucous<br />\nVictor-Victrola.<br />\nAdherence to no fixed rule or<br />\ncanon of the (lancing art is required<br />\nof the youthful aspirants for manly<br />\ngrace and beauty, a concerted and<br />\nrythmical motion being accepted as<br />\na sufficient indication of interest.<br />\nThe grace that was so characteristic<br />\nof the older civilizations is what the<br />\ngymnasium instructor is seeking<br />\nafter with the greatest degree of<br />\nearnestness, and this was of course<br />\nreached without the aid of intricate<br />\nmaxixe or deceptive fox-trot.<br />\nThe Victrola innovation has so<br />\nfar proved a very popular one, both<br />\nwith the freshmen immediately concerned and with the observant<br />\nupperclass men. It is the sincere<br />\nhope of the undergraduate body<br />\nas a whole that the new implement<br />\nof torture may have a long, an<br />\nhonorable and, above all, a distinctly<br />\nserviceable career.<br /><br />\nThose who are looking forward<br />\nto the outdoor .track season were<br />\nmuch encouraged by the reappearance of Huntley Lloyd on the squad<br />\nat the practice last Wednesday.<br />\nLloyd has been one of the best performers on the team for the past<br />\ntwo years, but he had to give up<br />\nthe game during the past indoor<br />\nseason on account of his work in<br />\nthe last year of the graduate chemistry department. He has, however, decided that he will have time<br />\nto resume training again this spring,<br />\nand has started to get himself into<br />\ncondition for the hard work to<br />\ncome.<br />\nThe prospects for the Black and<br />\nBlue in the Pennsylvania relay<br />\nraces on April 24 are greatly brightened by this valuable addition to<br />\nthe relay squad. Lloyd has broken<br />\nthe tape for Hopkins the past two<br />\nyears at this annual carnival, and<br />\nwith the further addition to the<br />\nsquad of Wright of the Medical<br />\nSchool, the team ought to rival the<br />\nsuccess of last year's unvanquished<br />\nfour.

The practices<br />\nheld in the cage during the past<br />\ntwo months have materially bettered<br />\nall out for the team, and it is said<br />\nthat the squad looks most promising this time. The new men especially are showing up well. The<br />\nwork of Henry Baker at goal is<br />\nvery commendable. Baker is developing into a goalkeeper of great<br />\npromise.<br />\nReal team work is now evident<br />\namong the men, since all members<br />\nof the squad play with a better<br />\nknowledge of the fine points of the<br />\ngame.

The<br />\nhighly courageous manner in which<br />\nhe kept up his manful fight against<br />\nconstantly menacing death, and<br />\nthe seemingly strengthening effect<br />\nwhich it produced on his general<br />\ncondition, had led many to hope<br />\nagainst hope that he might recover<br />\nthe so highly deserved good health<br />\nfor which he had striven in vain, and<br />\nwhen the news that he had finally<br />\nsuccumbed came it made it all the<br />\nharder to realize that his fight had<br />\nbeen lost. The wonderful grit<br />\nand stamnia which he manifested,<br />\ncoupled with his unquenchable optimism,'enade him loved not only by<br />\nhis fellow students, but by all to<br />\nwhom news of his struggle came.<br />\nThere is a most timely lesson to<br />\nbe drawn from the death of this<br />\nyoung hero. In the spectacle of<br />\nLayfield, living on in face of surely<br />\napproaching death with a courageous optimism and a determined will<br />\nworthy of being designated as almost superhuman, we see an example of what one person has been<br />\nable to do under the most adverse<br />\ncircumstances imaginable, and cannot help feeling that there is much<br />\nto be drawn from thought over the<br />\nmatter. Layfield has shown us<br />\nmuch which makes us ashamed of<br />\nourselves, yet which makes us feel<br />\nsadly proud that he was a Hopkins<br /><br />\nman, and which makes us hope that<br />\nhe may serve as a model for the<br />\nHopkins men who have been more<br />\nfortunate than he has.<br />\nThe feeling of grief which is<br />\nshared by all the students of the<br />\nUniversity over the tragic culmination of the play in the Lehigh game<br />\nlast October is made a very individual and personal one by several<br />\ncircumstances accompanying the<br />\ncase. Johns Hopkins is, first of all,<br />\na small institution and there is consequently every opportunity for undergraduates to become acquainted.<br />\nAnd thus, although Layfield had<br />\nbeen at the University only three<br />\nweeks, he was already more than a<br />\nname to a large number of the students\u2014a condition that would have<br />\nbeen practically impossible in a college with a larger undergraduate<br />\nenrollment; secondly, it was the<br />\nfirst fatal accident to occur at Hopkins as a result of indulgence in<br />\nathletic activities\u2014the former history of the various teams having<br />\nbeen singularly free from serious<br />\ninjuries to players; lastly, and by<br />\nodds most important of all, Bob's<br />\nwonderful struggle against the<br />\ndeath which everyone else feared<br />\nwas inevitable, the splendid pluck<br />\nthat enabled him to smile through<br />\nall his pain and persist in his intention to \"play again,\" and the undaunted spirit that led him to ask<br />\nthat all the games on the football<br />\nschedule should be played out even<br />\nin the event of his death before the<br />\nclose of the season, were contributing circumstances that brought his<br />\ncase home very closely to every<br />\nHopkins man and made him loved<br />\neven by those who had barely<br />\nlearned to know him. Hence it is<br />\nthat Layfield's death is not vaguely<br />\nregarded as a general calamity, but<br />\nis keenly felt as a deep and personal<br />\nloss.<br />\nPerhaps one more reason should<br />\nbe given for the wide sympathy expressed for the heroic little quarterback. During his long period of<br />\nsuffering, Layfield by no means lost<br />\ninterest in what was occurring at the<br />\nUniversity, but kept in the closest<br />\npossible touch with all its activities<br />\nwhile he was, as he himself felt,<br />\ntemporarily \"out of things.\" He<br />\nwas particularly concerned over the<br />\nfootball games still to be played,<br />\nand was very anxious that the<br />\nwearers of the Black and Blue<br />\nmight emerge victorious from their<br />\ngridiron encounter with the representatives of St. John's. And he<br />\nkept to the very last, as his chiefest<br />\ntreasure, the 'Varsity sweater with<br />\nits coveted \"H\" that had been presented to him by a special action<br />\nof the Athletic Board.<br />\nLayfield is dead, but his heroism<br />\nwill not soon be forgotten. All who<br />\nwatched the brave fight for life of<br />\nthe little freshman, paralyzed from<br />\nthe neck down, completely encased<br />\nin a plaster cast, but continuing to<br />\nstruggle and to hope until long<br />\nperiods of unconsciousness robbed<br />\nhim of his will, were deeply and<br />\npermanently impressed and affected.<br />\nAction with regard to the perpetuation of his name in the his-<br /><br />\nSWIMMING MEET<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS INDEPENDENTS<br />\nVS.<br /><br />\nPRINCETON<br />\nSATURDAY, MARCH 13.

As soon<br />\nas the news of his death came to<br />\nLehigh, the following well-written<br />\nand highly appreciated letter was<br />\ndrawn up and sent to Hopkins:<br />\nLEHIGH UNIVERSITY,<br />\nSOUTH BETHLEHEM, PA., March 2.<br />\nTo the Student Body of Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity:<br />\nThe students of Lehigh University<br />\nhave just heard of the lamented death<br />\nof Mr. Layfield, who was hurt in the<br />\ngame with Lehigh on October 31.

The gymnasium is not<br />\nto contain a swimming pool, and<br />\nthe students are agitating for the<br />\naddition of this feature. The Executive Committee of the student<br />\nbody has already voted $1,500 toward the construction of a pool.

The usual<br />\nprogram was rendered and the soloists and quartet received unusual<br />\napplause. After the concert, the<br />\nmusicians were served refreshments.<br />\nThe concert was a success from<br />\nevery angle, and as such, carries<br />\nforward the steady advance in quality of the performances given to<br />\ndate. That this advance indicates<br />\nreal work on the part of the Hopkins musicians, ,is obvious. Every<br />\nmember of the Clubs is showing an<br />\ninterest which is making this year's<br />\nMusical Clubs at least a rival of any<br />\nof those of previous years.<br />\nThat the management is not satisfied even with the marked successes so far, is shown by the fact<br />\nthat the repertoire is being increased along both vocal and instrumental lines. A mandolin club<br />\nhas been organized and promises<br />\nto prove a very attractive feature<br />\non future programs. The Glee<br />\nClub, under the direction of Leader<br />\nSpieker, starts in this week rehearsing new selections. Ultimately, the<br />\nmanagement hopes to have a repertoire such that programs may be<br />\nvaried to suit their patrons.<br />\nThe next concert will be given<br />\nnext Tuesday at Catonsville. Arrangements are being made for a<br />\ntrip to Tome Institute, and although<br />\nthe date has not been decided upon,<br />\nthe trip will most likely be taken<br />\nin the near future before the Easter<br />\nexaminations. The Glee Club has<br />\nbeen invited to render a few selections at the next faculty dance on<br />\nthe twenty-second of this month.<br />\nThe invitation, which has been accepted, is truly appreciated, since<br />\nit indicates an unusual interest and<br />\nsupport of the faculty in the musical activity at Hopkins.<br />\nPreparations are being made for<br />\na trip through Western Maryland<br />\nand West Virginia, to be taken during the Easter vacation, and a trip<br />\nto Cambridge will probably be<br />\nscheduled at a later date. The<br />\nmanagement is this year working<br />\nhard to take advantage of all possible opportunity to advertise Johns<br />\nT-Topkins, both in and about Baltimore and throughout more extensive areas. The work of the clubs<br />\nhas thus far proven entirely worthy<br />\nof being set forth as representative<br />\nof Johns Hopkins, and in view of<br />\nthe fact that all concerned are still<br />\nworking hard to attain to a still<br />\nhigher standard, there seems to be<br />\n\u2022 some promise of the performance<br />\nof a service of no mean value to<br />\nthe university.<br /><br />\nWANTED!<br />\nGuitar, Banjo and Mandolin Players<br /><br />\nSEE<br /><br />\nW.
