PAUL STREETS<br />\nCHARLES and FAYETTE STREETS<br />\nIn the Heart of the Heart of Maryland<br />\n<br />\nAs his third and final reason for<br />\nopposing armed conflict, Mr.<br />\nBlanchard stated that, fundamentally, all the major conflicts between<br />\ngreat powers are economic in nature<br />\nand are fought either for the protection of foreign investments, for<br />\nacquiring more trade or for the<br />\ncontrol of further sources of raw<br />\nmaterials. It would be rather hard,<br />\nhe said, to enlist an army for the<br />\navowed purpose of saving the investments of Mr. Morgan in France<br />\nand England or the Doheny oil reserves in Mexico. The fact that no<br />\none is agitating that France be invaded for non-payment of her debts<br />\nto this country is evidence of some<br />\nadvancement, perhaps, but upon<br />\nglancing at the situation in Haiti, it<br />\nbecomes more likely, evidence of<br />\nbelief that discretion is the better<br />\npart of valor, he said.<br />\n<br />\nProfessor McKibben told of the<br />\n\"roman bridge\" which he had designed.

PAUL STREETS<br />\nCHARLES and FAYETTE STREETS<br />\nIn the Heart of the Heart of Maryland<br /><br />\nAs his third and final reason for<br />\nopposing armed conflict, Mr.<br />\nBlanchard stated that, fundamentally, all the major conflicts between<br />\ngreat powers are economic in nature<br />\nand are fought either for the protection of foreign investments, for<br />\nacquiring more trade or for the<br />\ncontrol of further sources of raw<br />\nmaterials. It would be rather hard,<br />\nhe said, to enlist an army for the<br />\navowed purpose of saving the investments of Mr. Morgan in France<br />\nand England or the Doheny oil reserves in Mexico. The fact that no<br />\none is agitating that France be invaded for non-payment of her debts<br />\nto this country is evidence of some<br />\nadvancement, perhaps, but upon<br />\nglancing at the situation in Haiti, it<br />\nbecomes more likely, evidence of<br />\nbelief that discretion is the better<br />\npart of valor, he said.<br /><br />\nProfessor McKibben told of the<br />\n\"roman bridge\" which he had designed.
