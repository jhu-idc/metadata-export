We are quite sure that this same<br />\nfeeling is echoed by all those who grabbed the spark<br />\noffered to them by the program, and with it lighted the<br />\ntamp of higher learning.<br />\nThere have been many 'thrilling' experiences connected with the program, but for Lynn Poole his proudest<br />\nwas the year that freshmen avidly recalled the Hopkins<br />\nprogram, and the interest it generated, from their gradeschool days.<br />\n<br />\nOne Down\u2014Two To Go<br />\nThe Student Council jumped over the 2.3 minimum<br />\naverage at its meeting this week, and landed on a significant motion: that members of the Student Council will be<br />\nsubject to the same academic requirements as the executives of all other Hopkins organizations.

The concert was held at<br />\nLevering Hall and was in coordination with the German<br />\nclub at Goucher College. This is<br />\nthe first in a series of three<br />\nconcerts in three consecutive<br />\nweeks that will attempt to trace<br />\nthe development of the German<br />\ntongue through music. Next<br />\nTuesday, the concert will include<br />\nthe vocal music of the- classic<br />\nand romantic German composers. The third concert will<br />\nbe devoted to late romantic<br />\nleider through the works of<br />\nSchoenberg,<br />\nHindemith<br />\nand<br />\nmodern German Composers.<br />\nTuesday evening's concert began with a medieval song withaccompaniment,<br />\niated<br />\nout<br />\nabout the 12th century. Mark<br />\nPerel, who directed the program,<br />\nexplained how German vocal<br />\nmusic before Bach reached its<br />\n<br />\npeak with the works of Heinrich<br />\nSchurz in 1585. Schurz, who<br />\nstudied with Monteverdi in Italy,<br />\nbrought to German music many<br />\nof the complexities of Italian<br />\nbaroque music, which was already well advanced for its time.<br />\nThe program concluded with a<br />\ncross-section of the vocal music<br />\nof Bach, \"the pinnacle of the<br />\nbaroque.\" Excerpts included two<br />\nbaritone arias from Cantata's<br />\nno. 8 and 82 and a portion of St.<br />\nMathew's Passion.<br />\nTo this listener who knows no<br />\nGerman and simply listens to<br />\nmusic for pleasure, the program<br />\nwas very enjoyable. The music,<br />\nchosen seemed quite appropriate. Not only did it illustrate<br />\nthe evolution of medieval German music, it was also very<br />\npleasing to the ear. Anyone with<br />\nan interest in classical German<br />\nmusic will probably find the next<br />\ntwo concerts much to his liking.<br />\nNext week the program will feature music of, Beethoven and<br />\nMozart.

In fact,<br />\nthere were several cries from<br />\nthe pit which met with as much<br />\napproval as certain parts of the<br />\nactual production.<br />\nAs for talent, this reviewer is<br />\nforced to take the side of the<br />\nvillains. Of course, it must also<br />\nbe considered that these characterizations lent themselves to<br />\nhumor much more readily than<br />\nthose of the fair Prudence Hopewell and the \"dry\" Truman<br />\nPendennis. Peter Grossman, who<br />\nplayed the moustached, caped<br />\nvillain, Simon Darkway, carried out his role in a classic<br />\nmanner. However, whether or<br />\nnot he inspired any hate in the<br />\naudience is a matter left open to<br />\ndebate. His \"ever-scratching\"<br />\nand imbecilic stooge Dirk Sneath<br />\nwas very ably portrayed by Ed<br />\nShiller.<br />\nNancy Monroe as the ingenuous Miss Prudence Hopewell<br />\nevoked much applause from the<br />\naudience when, in the end of<br />\nthe play, she was forced to remove her skirt and reveal her<br />\nbloomers in the presence of<br />\ngentlemen. The widow Hopewell<br />\nwas also well characterized by<br />\nBarbara MacNamara. She provided much audience participation in the form of an \"Amen\"<br />\nafter every mention of her dear<br />\ndeparted husband\u2014Amen.<br />\nI found Joanne Winks' performance as the seductive Carlotta<br />\nCortez very convincing. The<br />\nmilk-sop, Truman Pendennis<br />\nand his naive playmate, Harold<br />\nStandfast, played by David<br />\nMunro and John Gunderson respectively, were not as convincing as they might have been.<br />\nA word must also be said for<br />\nDavid Hegen, who was responsible for the melodious tones<br />\nwhich emanated from a piano<br />\nwhich, I hope, has seen better<br />\ndays.

At<br />\nthis time 3.3% of the \"unde-<br /><br />\nNEW LIBRARY<br /><br />\ncided\" switched to Nixon.

It<br />\nwas becoming harder and harder for professors and<br />\nteachers to spare the time to help produce the kind of<br />\nquality shows typical to File 7.<br />\nIf it be so, let this be a black and white memorial to<br />\na fine job, well done. We are quite sure that this same<br />\nfeeling is echoed by all those who grabbed the spark<br />\noffered to them by the program, and with it lighted the<br />\ntamp of higher learning.<br />\nThere have been many 'thrilling' experiences connected with the program, but for Lynn Poole his proudest<br />\nwas the year that freshmen avidly recalled the Hopkins<br />\nprogram, and the interest it generated, from their gradeschool days.<br /><br />\nOne Down\u2014Two To Go<br />\nThe Student Council jumped over the 2.3 minimum<br />\naverage at its meeting this week, and landed on a significant motion: that members of the Student Council will be<br />\nsubject to the same academic requirements as the executives of all other Hopkins organizations. In effect, this<br />\nmeans, assuming the 2.3 is retained, that just to be a<br />\nmember of the council a man must hold an average of 2.3<br />\n\u2014required of the officers of all other organizations, but<br />\nnot of their members.

He<br />\nalso visited M.I.T.

The concert was held at<br />\nLevering Hall and was in coordination with the German<br />\nclub at Goucher College. This is<br />\nthe first in a series of three<br />\nconcerts in three consecutive<br />\nweeks that will attempt to trace<br />\nthe development of the German<br />\ntongue through music. Next<br />\nTuesday, the concert will include<br />\nthe vocal music of the- classic<br />\nand romantic German composers. The third concert will<br />\nbe devoted to late romantic<br />\nleider through the works of<br />\nSchoenberg,<br />\nHindemith<br />\nand<br />\nmodern German Composers.<br />\nTuesday evening's concert began with a medieval song withaccompaniment,<br />\niated<br />\nout<br />\nabout the 12th century. Mark<br />\nPerel, who directed the program,<br />\nexplained how German vocal<br />\nmusic before Bach reached its<br /><br />\npeak with the works of Heinrich<br />\nSchurz in 1585. Schurz, who<br />\nstudied with Monteverdi in Italy,<br />\nbrought to German music many<br />\nof the complexities of Italian<br />\nbaroque music, which was already well advanced for its time.<br />\nThe program concluded with a<br />\ncross-section of the vocal music<br />\nof Bach, \"the pinnacle of the<br />\nbaroque.\" Excerpts included two<br />\nbaritone arias from Cantata's<br />\nno. 8 and 82 and a portion of St.<br />\nMathew's Passion.<br />\nTo this listener who knows no<br />\nGerman and simply listens to<br />\nmusic for pleasure, the program<br />\nwas very enjoyable. The music,<br />\nchosen seemed quite appropriate. Not only did it illustrate<br />\nthe evolution of medieval German music, it was also very<br />\npleasing to the ear. Anyone with<br />\nan interest in classical German<br />\nmusic will probably find the next<br />\ntwo concerts much to his liking.<br />\nNext week the program will feature music of, Beethoven and<br />\nMozart.

In fact,<br />\nthere were several cries from<br />\nthe pit which met with as much<br />\napproval as certain parts of the<br />\nactual production.<br />\nAs for talent, this reviewer is<br />\nforced to take the side of the<br />\nvillains. Of course, it must also<br />\nbe considered that these characterizations lent themselves to<br />\nhumor much more readily than<br />\nthose of the fair Prudence Hopewell and the \"dry\" Truman<br />\nPendennis. Peter Grossman, who<br />\nplayed the moustached, caped<br />\nvillain, Simon Darkway, carried out his role in a classic<br />\nmanner. However, whether or<br />\nnot he inspired any hate in the<br />\naudience is a matter left open to<br />\ndebate. His \"ever-scratching\"<br />\nand imbecilic stooge Dirk Sneath<br />\nwas very ably portrayed by Ed<br />\nShiller.<br />\nNancy Monroe as the ingenuous Miss Prudence Hopewell<br />\nevoked much applause from the<br />\naudience when, in the end of<br />\nthe play, she was forced to remove her skirt and reveal her<br />\nbloomers in the presence of<br />\ngentlemen. The widow Hopewell<br />\nwas also well characterized by<br />\nBarbara MacNamara. She provided much audience participation in the form of an \"Amen\"<br />\nafter every mention of her dear<br />\ndeparted husband\u2014Amen.<br />\nI found Joanne Winks' performance as the seductive Carlotta<br />\nCortez very convincing. The<br />\nmilk-sop, Truman Pendennis<br />\nand his naive playmate, Harold<br />\nStandfast, played by David<br />\nMunro and John Gunderson respectively, were not as convincing as they might have been.<br />\nA word must also be said for<br />\nDavid Hegen, who was responsible for the melodious tones<br />\nwhich emanated from a piano<br />\nwhich, I hope, has seen better<br />\ndays.

Teachers laugh and smile and pound backs<br />\nand keep shouting \"Harry,you old Airedale!\" This unscholarly<br />\nbehavior is carried on in the hope that old grads, in a transport<br />\nof bonhomie will endow a new geology building.<br />\nThe old grads, however; are seldom seduced.
