Kelly would<br />\nendeavor to establish a free radium<br />\nclinic for the treatment of cancerous<br />\nand kindred diseases. As Dr. Kelly<br />\nis a Baltimorean, and professor of<br />\ngynecology in the University, this<br />\nnews is of esix:cial interest to Hopkins people, especially, as Dr. Kelly<br />\nhas said that he would endeavor to<br />\nmake his free clinic an integral part<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nThis news comes as a fitting climax<br />\nto one of the greatest discoveries in<br />\nmedical science, the discovery of<br />\nradium as a cure for cancer, which<br />\nhas been heretofore considered an<br />\nunconquerable di.ease. It can also<br />\nbe used as a certain cure for tumors<br />\nand the like. The unfortunate part<br />\nof it, however, is the extreme cost<br />\nof radium, which is now the most<br />\nprecious substance in the world.<br />\nThe price is now ninety dollars a<br />\nmilligram (about one-sixteen thousandth of an ounce) and steadily<br />\nrising, due to the great demand for<br />\nit, as nearly every hospital and<br />\nmedical school in the world is<br />\neagerly trying to obtain some small<br />\namount of this wonderful cure.<br />\nDr. Kelly has said that the plans<br />\nfor the clinic are rather in abeyance<br />\njust at present, but that the only<br />\nthing necessary is the acquisition of<br />\na sufficient amount of radium. He<br />\nadded that at present he possesses<br />\none gram of the precious material,<br />\nand soon hopes to acquire a few<br />\nmore grams, in order to expedite<br />\nthe formation of the clinic. This<br />\nclinic will be free to all who are<br />\nunable to pay, \"free as the wind,\"<br />\nDr. Kelly says, and will be an inestimable boon to humanity, as it<br />\nwill be the wily one of its kind in<br />\nthe world. Dr. Kelly himself is<br />\nthe moving spirit in this enterprise,<br />\nbeing aided by Dr. Douglas, of New<br />\nYork, who is connected with the<br />\nPhelps-Dodge Mining Company,<br />\none of the largest concerns in the<br />\nworld. As to the establishment of<br />\nthe clinic in connection with the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Kelly<br />\nsays the matter is entirely up to<br />\nthe trustees of the Hospital and of<br />\nthe University. As the Johns Hopkins University has always been to<br />\nthe fore in the advancement of<br />\nmedical science, it is expected that<br />\nadvantage will be taken of such an<br />\nunparalleled opportunity to continue<br />\nits great work.<br />\n<br />\nThe senior class, in order to<br />\nfinance its \"Hullabaloo, has secured<br />\na benefit at Ford's on next Monday<br />\nnight, November 17. John Drew,<br />\nthe noted American comedian, will<br />\nappear for the first time in Baltimore in his latest comedy hits,\"The<br />\nWill\" and \"The Tyranny of Tears.\"<br />\nThe \"Hullabaloo\" Board is most<br />\nanxious that all Hopkins men buy<br />\ntickets for this benefit; for the<br />\nmoney received from this source<br />\nhelps very materially in the publication of the \"Hullabaloo. Tickets<br />\nmay be obtained from any member<br />\nof the senior class, or from the<br />\nUniversity postoffice. The management has also sent out a large number of tickets among the faculty, the<br />\nalumni, the graduate students, and<br />\nthe friends of the University. If<br />\nanyone has received tickets, and has<br />\nnot returned his money, the \"Hullabaloo\" Board urges that he do so<br />\nat once.<br />\nThe following is a short description of this splendid bill:<br />\n, The distinguished American comedian, John Drew, appears for the<br />\nfirst time in Baltimore in his latest<br />\ncomedy triumphs that are now being<br />\nsuccessfully produced at the Empire<br />\nTheatre in New York. Mr. Drew<br />\nand his company come direct from<br />\nNew York to Ford's.<br />\nIn all his career Mr. Drew has<br />\nnever had a fuller or a finer program than this present double bill.<br />\n\"The Will\" is a new work by the<br />\nrecently-knighted J. M. Barrie, the<br />\nauthor of \"The Little Minister,\"<br />\n\"Peter Pan,\" and \"What Every<br />\nWoman Knows.\" \"The Tyranny of<br />\nTears\" is a superbly modern comedy<br />\nby C. Haddon Chambers. These<br />\nexceptional plays will delight all<br />\nlovers of the highest dramatic art,<br />\nand in the leading roles Mr. Drew's<br />\nartistic charm and magnetism have<br />\nnever been more appealing.<br />\nBoth plays are exceedingly attractive, and superbly interpreted<br />\nby the New York company, including Julian L'Estrange, Mary Boland, Frank Kemble Cooper, Laura<br />\nHope Crews, Herbert Druce, Murray Ross and others. Mr. Drew<br />\nis under the management of Charles<br />\nFrohman, and both plays are produced under the stage direction of<br />\nWilliam Seymour.<br />\nDr. French\u2014What are the three<br />\nmost used words in this school?<br />\nPreshie\u2014I don't know.<br />\nDr. French\u2014Correct; sit down!<br />\n<br />\nDuring the week of November 9<br />\nto 16,the First Presbyterian Church,<br />\nPark avenue and Madison street,<br />\ncommemorates the 150th anniversary of its founding. Services will<br />\nbe held on November II and 12,<br />\nbut the service of most interest to<br />\nstudents will be held at three o'clock<br />\nSunday, November 16. At this<br />\nservice Dr. Robert E. Speer will<br />\nspeak.<br />\nThis service is primarily for the<br />\ncollegiate students of Baltimore. A<br />\ngroup of Johns Hopkins men will<br />\nlead the singing, and Dean Griffin<br />\nof this University and Dr. Hiram<br />\nWoods of the University of Maryland will preside at the service. Dr.<br />\nBarr, the minister of the church,<br />\nextends through THE NEws-LETTER a personal invitation to every<br />\nHopkins man to attend this service.<br />\nDr. Speer is recognized in the<br />\nOrient and throughout the countries<br />\nof Europe, as well as in America,<br />\nas probably the leader in the modern field of Christian work and endeavor. He received his A.B. at<br />\nPrinceton, '89, and was a classmate<br />\nand comrade of Dr. Barr. He made<br />\nat Princeton, it is said, a higher<br />\naverage than any man since Aaron<br />\nBurr, and at the same time played<br />\nend on the football team.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that Dr.<br />\nSpeer is the fifth layman, not a<br />\nminister, to be granted the degree of doctor of divinity by the<br />\nUniversity of Edinburgh. The<br />\nfourth was Prince Bismarck, the<br />\nfamous Chancellor of Germany.<br />\nFrancis L. Patton, D.D., LL.D.,<br />\npreceded President Woodrow Wilson as the president of Princeton<br />\nUniversity. He is in charge of the<br />\nTheological Seminary at Princeton,<br />\nand, says Dr. Barr, cis recognized<br />\nas one of the keenest minds at work<br />\ntoday in facing the intellectual problems arising in the student world.\"<br />\n<br />\nPlaying like a whirlwind from<br />\nstart to finish, the Carlisle Indians<br />\noverwhelmed Hopkins Saturday by<br />\nsheer superiority; the final score<br />\nbeing 61 to o. The Black and Blue<br />\nput up a hard fight, but was unable<br />\nto withstand the massed charging<br />\nof the heavy Indian backs, or to<br />\nbreak down their solid interference.<br />\nThe red men played like a well oiled<br />\nmachine, and seemed to be able to<br />\ngain whatever they wanted throughout the contest.<br />\nBranham played a beautiful game<br />\nfor.Hopkins; his tackling was sure<br />\nand hard, and whenever he received<br />\nthe ball on the kickoff, he tore like<br />\na streak through the line of oncoming Indians, advancing the ball<br />\nremarkably far. Captain Leibensperger was most aggressive. Tippett<br />\nand Fulton also did star playing.<br />\nThe Indians scored first after<br />\nabout three minutes of play. After<br />\nthe kickoff, Wilkins9p to Calac,<br />\nthe Indians madt--firs-vdown on the<br />\ntwo-line plays, and then advanced<br />\nthe ball steadily, Calac doing most<br />\nof the gaining, until, by a perfect<br />\nforward pass, they got it to the fiveyard line. Then they fumbled, but<br />\nGarlow quickly recovered the ball.<br />\nHopkins held for one play, but on<br />\nthe next, Calac carried the ball over.<br />\nGarlow missed goal. Score, 6 to 0.<br />\nWilkinson kicked off to Bracklin,<br />\nand Carlisle took the ball steadily<br />\nup the field to the 20-yard line,<br />\nwhence, by three well executed<br />\ndouble passes, Calac again carried<br />\nthe ball over. Guyon kicked.<br />\nAt the next kickoff the quarter<br />\nended. During the next period the<br />\nIndians crossed the goal twice, Guyon kicking successfull both times.<br />\nThe double pass was used by Carlisle to great advantage in gaining<br />\nthese touchdowns.<br />\nIn the third period the Indians<br />\nkicked off to Branham who ad(('ontinued on page 8, col. 2.)<br />\n<br />\nYou are cordially invited to hear<br />\n<br />\nROBERT E.

It<br />\nis true that the appeal of the college<br />\nannual is limited to a small sphere,<br />\nand within that sphere is varying<br />\nforce; but it is from a no larger<br />\nnumber of persons that the money<br />\nand work comes, and for them it is<br />\na very worth while sacrifice. How<br />\nmany men have wished they had a<br />\nrecord of their years between boy<br />\nand man\u2014of all the times of life in<br />\nmany ways the most definitive and<br />\n--reminiscentially interesting. The<br />\nclass-book is a permanent and artistic memento in word and picture<br />\nof the happenings and surroundings of a detached but crowded four<br />\nyears, which otherw'ise too often<br />\nblur in later memory to a phantasmagoria of traditional \"college life\"<br />\n\u2014a far, far cry from the real.<br />\nThe fact remains that the creation<br />\nof a book is a long, hard job\u2014to get<br />\nthe material, to discover some original way of molding what tends to<br />\nassume the most conventional of<br />\nforms, to raise the wherewithal. In<br />\nthis last everyone can help. Especially at Hopkins is it true that the<br />\ntask cannot be turned over to a<br />\nboard and forgotten. We have<br />\nneither the pull of West Point or<br />\nAnnapolis, nor the multitudinous<br />\nstudent 1?ody of Harvard or Michigan to make the advertisement-hunt<br />\na primrose path to easy financing.<br />\nNor are our classes large enough<br />\nfo.: pocket-digging to produce great<br />\ntreasure. The \"Hullabaloo\" needs<br />\nand expects a general manifestation<br />\nof supporting school-spirit (to use<br />\na much-tortured term legitimately).<br />\nIf anyone has a peculiar chance to<br />\nland an \"ad\" for the book, do it<br />\nwithout grubbing for commission\u2014<br />\nevery member of the Board does a<br />\nhundred times the work without re-<br />\n<br />\nturn.

Howard St, at Franklin<br />\n<br />\nThe Annual Disaster.<br />\n<br />\nEvery convenience that people<br />\nhave must be paid for in some way<br />\nor other, and it seems that the use<br />\nof the University elevator may soon<br />\nbe paid for by physical injury to<br />\nsome of the many who patronize it<br />\ndaily. On Wednesday of last week<br />\nthe car dropped from the first floor<br />\nto the bottom of the shaft\u2014an annual occurrence. It is fortunate that<br />\nnone of the passengers were hurt,<br />\nyet a drop from the third or fourth<br />\nfloor would undoubtedly result in<br />\na wrecked car and broken bones.<br />\nThe service on the elevator is admittedly poor, either because the<br />\noperator is unskilled, or because the<br />\ncar does not obey the lever. There<br />\nare frequent stops midway between<br />\nfloors when the elevator has overrun its scheduled station. When<br />\nupward bound this results merely<br />\nin delay and often in a mad rush<br />\nof students down the corridors and<br />\na dash into a lecture-room after the<br />\nroll has been taken. But when the<br />\nelevator fails to stop on its downward course, the passengers find<br />\ntheir hearts in their throats for fear<br />\nof the annual disaster. The \"freshmen have no fear,\" for they may<br />\nnot ride; but a general boycott of<br />\nthis invidious elevator might effect its safety more so than does the<br />\ncity inspector.<br />\n\u2022 Thrilling \"movies\" of the Hopkins-Swarthmore game at the Pickwick were responsible for \"cuts\"<br />\nlast week.

Kelly would<br />\nendeavor to establish a free radium<br />\nclinic for the treatment of cancerous<br />\nand kindred diseases. As Dr. Kelly<br />\nis a Baltimorean, and professor of<br />\ngynecology in the University, this<br />\nnews is of esix:cial interest to Hopkins people, especially, as Dr. Kelly<br />\nhas said that he would endeavor to<br />\nmake his free clinic an integral part<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nThis news comes as a fitting climax<br />\nto one of the greatest discoveries in<br />\nmedical science, the discovery of<br />\nradium as a cure for cancer, which<br />\nhas been heretofore considered an<br />\nunconquerable di.ease. It can also<br />\nbe used as a certain cure for tumors<br />\nand the like. The unfortunate part<br />\nof it, however, is the extreme cost<br />\nof radium, which is now the most<br />\nprecious substance in the world.<br />\nThe price is now ninety dollars a<br />\nmilligram (about one-sixteen thousandth of an ounce) and steadily<br />\nrising, due to the great demand for<br />\nit, as nearly every hospital and<br />\nmedical school in the world is<br />\neagerly trying to obtain some small<br />\namount of this wonderful cure.<br />\nDr. Kelly has said that the plans<br />\nfor the clinic are rather in abeyance<br />\njust at present, but that the only<br />\nthing necessary is the acquisition of<br />\na sufficient amount of radium. He<br />\nadded that at present he possesses<br />\none gram of the precious material,<br />\nand soon hopes to acquire a few<br />\nmore grams, in order to expedite<br />\nthe formation of the clinic. This<br />\nclinic will be free to all who are<br />\nunable to pay, \"free as the wind,\"<br />\nDr. Kelly says, and will be an inestimable boon to humanity, as it<br />\nwill be the wily one of its kind in<br />\nthe world. Dr. Kelly himself is<br />\nthe moving spirit in this enterprise,<br />\nbeing aided by Dr. Douglas, of New<br />\nYork, who is connected with the<br />\nPhelps-Dodge Mining Company,<br />\none of the largest concerns in the<br />\nworld. As to the establishment of<br />\nthe clinic in connection with the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Kelly<br />\nsays the matter is entirely up to<br />\nthe trustees of the Hospital and of<br />\nthe University. As the Johns Hopkins University has always been to<br />\nthe fore in the advancement of<br />\nmedical science, it is expected that<br />\nadvantage will be taken of such an<br />\nunparalleled opportunity to continue<br />\nits great work.<br /><br />\nThe senior class, in order to<br />\nfinance its \"Hullabaloo, has secured<br />\na benefit at Ford's on next Monday<br />\nnight, November 17. John Drew,<br />\nthe noted American comedian, will<br />\nappear for the first time in Baltimore in his latest comedy hits,\"The<br />\nWill\" and \"The Tyranny of Tears.\"<br />\nThe \"Hullabaloo\" Board is most<br />\nanxious that all Hopkins men buy<br />\ntickets for this benefit; for the<br />\nmoney received from this source<br />\nhelps very materially in the publication of the \"Hullabaloo. Tickets<br />\nmay be obtained from any member<br />\nof the senior class, or from the<br />\nUniversity postoffice. The management has also sent out a large number of tickets among the faculty, the<br />\nalumni, the graduate students, and<br />\nthe friends of the University. If<br />\nanyone has received tickets, and has<br />\nnot returned his money, the \"Hullabaloo\" Board urges that he do so<br />\nat once.<br />\nThe following is a short description of this splendid bill:<br />\n, The distinguished American comedian, John Drew, appears for the<br />\nfirst time in Baltimore in his latest<br />\ncomedy triumphs that are now being<br />\nsuccessfully produced at the Empire<br />\nTheatre in New York. Mr. Drew<br />\nand his company come direct from<br />\nNew York to Ford's.<br />\nIn all his career Mr. Drew has<br />\nnever had a fuller or a finer program than this present double bill.<br />\n\"The Will\" is a new work by the<br />\nrecently-knighted J. M. Barrie, the<br />\nauthor of \"The Little Minister,\"<br />\n\"Peter Pan,\" and \"What Every<br />\nWoman Knows.\" \"The Tyranny of<br />\nTears\" is a superbly modern comedy<br />\nby C. Haddon Chambers. These<br />\nexceptional plays will delight all<br />\nlovers of the highest dramatic art,<br />\nand in the leading roles Mr. Drew's<br />\nartistic charm and magnetism have<br />\nnever been more appealing.<br />\nBoth plays are exceedingly attractive, and superbly interpreted<br />\nby the New York company, including Julian L'Estrange, Mary Boland, Frank Kemble Cooper, Laura<br />\nHope Crews, Herbert Druce, Murray Ross and others. Mr. Drew<br />\nis under the management of Charles<br />\nFrohman, and both plays are produced under the stage direction of<br />\nWilliam Seymour.<br />\nDr. French\u2014What are the three<br />\nmost used words in this school?<br />\nPreshie\u2014I don't know.<br />\nDr. French\u2014Correct; sit down!<br /><br />\nDuring the week of November 9<br />\nto 16,the First Presbyterian Church,<br />\nPark avenue and Madison street,<br />\ncommemorates the 150th anniversary of its founding. Services will<br />\nbe held on November II and 12,<br />\nbut the service of most interest to<br />\nstudents will be held at three o'clock<br />\nSunday, November 16. At this<br />\nservice Dr. Robert E. Speer will<br />\nspeak.<br />\nThis service is primarily for the<br />\ncollegiate students of Baltimore. A<br />\ngroup of Johns Hopkins men will<br />\nlead the singing, and Dean Griffin<br />\nof this University and Dr. Hiram<br />\nWoods of the University of Maryland will preside at the service. Dr.<br />\nBarr, the minister of the church,<br />\nextends through THE NEws-LETTER a personal invitation to every<br />\nHopkins man to attend this service.<br />\nDr. Speer is recognized in the<br />\nOrient and throughout the countries<br />\nof Europe, as well as in America,<br />\nas probably the leader in the modern field of Christian work and endeavor. He received his A.B. at<br />\nPrinceton, '89, and was a classmate<br />\nand comrade of Dr. Barr. He made<br />\nat Princeton, it is said, a higher<br />\naverage than any man since Aaron<br />\nBurr, and at the same time played<br />\nend on the football team.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that Dr.<br />\nSpeer is the fifth layman, not a<br />\nminister, to be granted the degree of doctor of divinity by the<br />\nUniversity of Edinburgh. The<br />\nfourth was Prince Bismarck, the<br />\nfamous Chancellor of Germany.<br />\nFrancis L. Patton, D.D., LL.D.,<br />\npreceded President Woodrow Wilson as the president of Princeton<br />\nUniversity. He is in charge of the<br />\nTheological Seminary at Princeton,<br />\nand, says Dr. Barr, cis recognized<br />\nas one of the keenest minds at work<br />\ntoday in facing the intellectual problems arising in the student world.\"<br /><br />\nPlaying like a whirlwind from<br />\nstart to finish, the Carlisle Indians<br />\noverwhelmed Hopkins Saturday by<br />\nsheer superiority; the final score<br />\nbeing 61 to o. The Black and Blue<br />\nput up a hard fight, but was unable<br />\nto withstand the massed charging<br />\nof the heavy Indian backs, or to<br />\nbreak down their solid interference.<br />\nThe red men played like a well oiled<br />\nmachine, and seemed to be able to<br />\ngain whatever they wanted throughout the contest.<br />\nBranham played a beautiful game<br />\nfor.Hopkins; his tackling was sure<br />\nand hard, and whenever he received<br />\nthe ball on the kickoff, he tore like<br />\na streak through the line of oncoming Indians, advancing the ball<br />\nremarkably far. Captain Leibensperger was most aggressive. Tippett<br />\nand Fulton also did star playing.<br />\nThe Indians scored first after<br />\nabout three minutes of play. After<br />\nthe kickoff, Wilkins9p to Calac,<br />\nthe Indians madt--firs-vdown on the<br />\ntwo-line plays, and then advanced<br />\nthe ball steadily, Calac doing most<br />\nof the gaining, until, by a perfect<br />\nforward pass, they got it to the fiveyard line. Then they fumbled, but<br />\nGarlow quickly recovered the ball.<br />\nHopkins held for one play, but on<br />\nthe next, Calac carried the ball over.<br />\nGarlow missed goal. Score, 6 to 0.<br />\nWilkinson kicked off to Bracklin,<br />\nand Carlisle took the ball steadily<br />\nup the field to the 20-yard line,<br />\nwhence, by three well executed<br />\ndouble passes, Calac again carried<br />\nthe ball over. Guyon kicked.<br />\nAt the next kickoff the quarter<br />\nended. During the next period the<br />\nIndians crossed the goal twice, Guyon kicking successfull both times.<br />\nThe double pass was used by Carlisle to great advantage in gaining<br />\nthese touchdowns.<br />\nIn the third period the Indians<br />\nkicked off to Branham who ad(('ontinued on page 8, col. 2.)<br /><br />\nYou are cordially invited to hear<br /><br />\nROBERT E.

The<br />\nclass-book is a permanent and artistic memento in word and picture<br />\nof the happenings and surroundings of a detached but crowded four<br />\nyears, which otherw'ise too often<br />\nblur in later memory to a phantasmagoria of traditional \"college life\"<br />\n\u2014a far, far cry from the real.<br />\nThe fact remains that the creation<br />\nof a book is a long, hard job\u2014to get<br />\nthe material, to discover some original way of molding what tends to<br />\nassume the most conventional of<br />\nforms, to raise the wherewithal. In<br />\nthis last everyone can help. Especially at Hopkins is it true that the<br />\ntask cannot be turned over to a<br />\nboard and forgotten.

Howard St, at Franklin<br /><br />\nThe Annual Disaster.<br /><br />\nEvery convenience that people<br />\nhave must be paid for in some way<br />\nor other, and it seems that the use<br />\nof the University elevator may soon<br />\nbe paid for by physical injury to<br />\nsome of the many who patronize it<br />\ndaily. On Wednesday of last week<br />\nthe car dropped from the first floor<br />\nto the bottom of the shaft\u2014an annual occurrence. It is fortunate that<br />\nnone of the passengers were hurt,<br />\nyet a drop from the third or fourth<br />\nfloor would undoubtedly result in<br />\na wrecked car and broken bones.<br />\nThe service on the elevator is admittedly poor, either because the<br />\noperator is unskilled, or because the<br />\ncar does not obey the lever. There<br />\nare frequent stops midway between<br />\nfloors when the elevator has overrun its scheduled station. When<br />\nupward bound this results merely<br />\nin delay and often in a mad rush<br />\nof students down the corridors and<br />\na dash into a lecture-room after the<br />\nroll has been taken. But when the<br />\nelevator fails to stop on its downward course, the passengers find<br />\ntheir hearts in their throats for fear<br />\nof the annual disaster. The \"freshmen have no fear,\" for they may<br />\nnot ride; but a general boycott of<br />\nthis invidious elevator might effect its safety more so than does the<br />\ncity inspector.<br />\n\u2022 Thrilling \"movies\" of the Hopkins-Swarthmore game at the Pickwick were responsible for \"cuts\"<br />\nlast week.

Some<br />\nof the older men are suggesting<br />\nthat the musicians do not try to do<br />\nup everything in one or two trips.<br />\nSeveral of the older men know from<br />\nexperience that a trip of more than<br />\ntwo concerts becomes monotonous,<br />\nwhile if there are six or seven trips<br />\ninterspersed throughout the year,<br />\neverybody can enjoy them more.<br />\nThe manager of the Clubs is always ready to receive the three-dollar assessment fee.<br />\nThe Glee Club held its usual three<br />\nrehearsals. The tenors are making<br />\nfine progress, and the second bassos<br />\nare also doing good work. The first<br />\nbassos, however, seem a little backward. There are about twenty men<br />\nin this \"first-base squad,\" a number<br />\nof whom will have to be weeded out<br />\nbefore concert time. The Instrumental Club is, holding its practices<br />\non Saturday mornings at 9.30. This<br />\nis done in order to enable the men<br />\nfrom the Medical School to attend.<br />\nThe \"Meds\" are sending two mandolins and a pianist as their representatives.
