The acceptance of<br />\nthis pact represented the<br />\nculmination of weeks of debate<br />\nand argument, in which<br />\nnumerous proposals were put<br />\nforth by SAC members<br />\nmodifying the original document<br />\ndrafted by SAC Executive<br />\nCommittee members Alan Fink,<br />\nAndrew Savitz, and Alan<br />\nSapakie, and submitted October<br />\n3.<br />\nDespite the overwhelming vote<br />\nfor ratification of the by-laws<br />\nand guidelines, dissent was heard<br />\nfrom certain SAC members,<br />\nincluding Sue Fino, who<br />\nsummarized her feelings by<br />\ncommenting,\"This document is a<br />\nmess.\"<br />\nFino alleged the by-laws and<br />\nguidelines were filled with<br />\ncontradictions and advised the<br />\nrewriting of the document with<br />\nresubmission to the SAC after<br />\nintersession:<br />\nAndrew Savitz, Student<br />\nCouncil President, expressed his<br />\nbelief that the by-laws and<br />\nguidelines contained problems,<br />\nblit these would be worked out<br />\nin time with their application.<br />\nMuch of the discussion at the<br />\nmeeting centered around the<br />\ninstitution of these by-laws and<br />\nguidelines as policy for the SAC.<br />\nThe pact must be submitted now<br />\nto theStudent Council for its<br />\napproval. Assuming they are<br />\naccepted by the Council, the<br />\nby-laws and guidelines would<br />\nthen be voted upon by students<br />\nin the form of a referendum.<br />\nCertain SAC members stressed<br />\nthe need for rapid action and<br />\nimplementation of the approved<br />\nrules and expressed<br />\ndisappointment when Savitz<br />\n<br />\nannounced that a referendum<br />\nwould not be held before the SC<br />\ngeneral elections, the first week<br />\nof March.<br />\nSavitz pointed out that the SC<br />\nwould not be able to come to a<br />\ndecision on these SAC by-laws<br />\nuntil the end of this semester. In<br />\nresponse to a proposal for staging<br />\na referendum coincident with<br />\nregistration at the beginning of<br />\nthe second semester, Savitz<br />\ncontended that this would<br />\ndeprive students of the<br />\nopportunity to evaluate the<br />\ndocument carefully. He<br />\nexpressed his belief that waiting a<br />\nnumber of weeks would obviate<br />\nthe difficulty associated with<br />\nstaging an additional referendum.<br />\nNevertheless, certain<br />\nresolutions were adopted by the<br />\nSAC concerning the<br />\nimplementation of the by-laws.<br />\nOne of these included a motion<br />\nto immediately institute the<br />\nprovisions of the document<br />\nshould it receive student approval<br />\nthrough the referendum.<br />\nAnother motion, put forth by<br />\nEdward Brokans, called upon the<br />\nSC to ts_mporarily' institute the<br />\n<br />\nEdward Brokans<br />\n<br />\nby-laws effective between the<br />\ntime the SC adopts them and the<br />\nstudent referendum. Both<br />\nresolutions were approved<br />\noverwhelmingly.<br />\nFollowing the various votes, as<br />\nChairman Fink was ready to<br />\nembark upon what he called \"the<br />\nreal purpose of the SAC,\" the<br />\nmeeting degenerated into a<br />\ndiscussion of Fink's \"disparaging<br />\nremarks\" concerning SAC<br />\nmembers whom he dubbed as<br />\n\"groping for power.\"<br />\nEdward Brokans expressed his<br />\npersonal dissatisfaction, calling<br />\nupon Fink to apologize for his<br />\nstatements. Fink refused to<br />\ncomment on this issue.<br />\n<br />\nThe specialized curriculum will<br />\nbe handled jointly by key<br />\nHomewood faculty and<br />\nprofessors from the School of<br />\nPublic Health and is theoretically<br />\nlimited to twenty-five students,<br />\naccording to Dan Holik, one of<br />\nthe three undergraduate members<br />\nof the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies (CUS)<br />\nwho presented the two proposals<br />\nto the Council.<br />\nThe CUS, a subcommittee of<br />\nthe \u2022Council, unanimously<br />\napproved the program at its<br />\nNovember 7 meeting.<br />\n\"Hopkins is the first school to<br />\nstart a program like this,\" Helik<br />\nasserted. \"It's basis is to get<br />\nqualified scientists in the public<br />\nhealth field.\"<br />\nGeorge Owen, Dean of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, stated, \"The<br />\nproposal passed with alot of<br />\nquestions and alot of discussion.\"<br />\nHolik revealed that most of<br />\nthe questions concerned the<br />\nresponsibility the Homewood<br />\nDivision would have in teaching<br />\nand funding the program. \"We<br />\nexplained that the increased<br />\nteaching load and funding would<br />\ncome from the School of Public<br />\nHealth,\" Holik said.<br />\nAcademic Council member Dr.<br />\nElias Rivers, Romance Languages<br />\nDepartment, commented that the<br />\nvote for the new major was<br />\nunanimous \"since we realized the<br />\nSchool of Public Health and<br />\nHygiene was willing to do the<br />\nextra work to get good majors.\"<br />\nHe added, \"It seems like a good<br />\nidea.\"<br />\nAfter examining the pass-fail<br />\n<br />\nfigures from last year the Council<br />\nalso voted to retain the alternatt<br />\ngrading policy.<br />\nHolik revealed that the report<br />\non pass-fail which he wrote with<br />\nDr. Fredrick Dierman,<br />\nUndergraduate Coordinator of<br />\nAdvising and Counseling, \"shows<br />\nthat students used pass-fail to<br />\nexpand their breadth of courses.\"<br />\n3ption<br />\nHe added that although most<br />\ngraduate school associate a<br />\n\"Pass\" with a \"C\" grade,<br />\nstatistics show that \"at Hopkins<br />\nthere is good chance that the<br />\ngrade is a 'B' or an `A'.\"<br />\nAlthough Holik stated that the<br />\nCouncil seemed very pleased with<br />\nthe report and no Council<br />\nmembers voiced objections on<br />\ncontinuing the option,. Rivers<br />\nsaid, \"Some members had<br />\nreservations on the principle, of<br />\npass-fail.\" However, they were in<br />\nthe minority, he stipulated.<br />\nCouncil members also<br />\ndiscussed possible changes in the<br />\ngrading policy for first semester<br />\nfreshmen, which is now open<br />\nentirely pass-fail.<br />\n\"There is sometimes pressure<br />\nlater to release freshman grades<br />\nto grad schools,\" Rivers said.<br />\n\"We want to stablize a policy<br />\nthat will please most students.\"<br />\nThe Council was informed that<br />\nDr. Richard Fried of Harvard<br />\nUniversity has accepted a<br />\nposition in the Humanities<br />\nCenter and the History of Art<br />\nDept.

Thinking of then and now,<br />\nas I did in the Glass Pavillion, I was<br />\ndisturbed by the absence of several<br />\nfaces. I tried for a moment to<br />\ncompare the 1975 Hullabaloo with<br />\nthe 1971-72 Pig Book (out of<br />\nprint). I was troubled by the<br />\nnotoriety of the \"dropouts,\" there<br />\nwere thieves, junkies, and suicide<br />\nvictims. Those were the faces that<br />\nassailed the innocence of the<br />\nHopkins Pig Book, they are the<br />\nsame faces, hardly forgotten, that<br />\nwill rebuke the noble academic<br />\nachievement represented by the<br />\n1975 Hullabaloo and<br />\ncommencement. I have come to<br />\nbesmirch the exquisite revelry of<br />\nthe first and last day of college,<br />\nand well as the dreams come true<br />\nthat take place in between. Should<br />\nwe forget these class tragedies34 We<br />\ncome to Hopkins for better or<br />\nworse, in sickness and health, and<br />\nwe are divorced or run away<br />\naccordingly. That is what college is<br />\nundeniably about.<br />\nWe value too dearly our college<br />\nyears in light of the fertilization<br />\nour intellects receive;few lifestyles<br />\nother than that of the colleged<br />\nstudent seem a fructive.

To be<br />\nsure, undergraduate<br />\ntranscendentalism is an alternative<br />\nto quitting school, but we should<br />\ncall upon the muse, Thoreau:<br />\nI aspire to be acquainted<br />\nwith wiser men than this our<br />\nConcord soil has produced,<br />\nwhose names are hardly<br />\nknown here.

That is one reason<br />\nwhy we construct our own<br />\ncurricula, in school and out.<br />\nI'd like to focus my attention on<br />\na \"dropout\" who knows all too<br />\nwell the cruelties of life off campus<br />\nand out of school. He learned the<br />\nlessons he had to, he experienced<br />\nwhat awaits us, without the revelry<br />\n..<br />\nof the present. At best, he is<br />\nthought of as a criminal student, or<br />\nis remembered as a victim of<br />\nintellectual suicide. I tried to talk<br />\nto Bill Abbott about his<br />\nexperiences of late. I was inspired<br />\n<br />\nby a photograph of J.D. Salinger<br />\nappearing in a recent Newsweek.<br />\nSalinger is one who guards his<br />\nprivacy well, and I thought of Bill<br />\nAbbott in this respect. Abbott<br />\ndidn't think Of Hopkins as the<br />\nideal intellectual existence it is<br />\nfashioned to be, and he treasured<br />\nthis opinion. Abbott never made it<br />\nin the Gate. House as<br />\nEditor-in-Chief, and we know what<br />\nthe paper would have been like if<br />\nhe stayed for one more year. In the<br />\ncareer of the class of 1975, Bill<br />\nAbbott wrote an array of articles<br />\ncovering such topics as the federal<br />\nand state funding of private<br />\nuniversities. He interview Walter<br />\nCronkite, Russell Baker, and he<br />\nspoke with Dr. Muller on several<br />\noccassions. We remember best an<br />\ninterview with President Muller<br />\nabout his friends at USC: Bob<br />\nHaldeman,and John Erlichman. We<br />\nfelt editied, but Abbott could do<br />\nthat easily with his pen.<br />\nMere restlessness forces<br />\naction. So passes the whole of<br />\nlife.

He<br />\nwas holding all the valuables he<br />\nhad been able to find in the<br />\nlivingroom. They stared at one<br />\nanother momentarily, like old<br />\nfriends meeting on the street.

Think back to the<br />\nfirst spring fair in 1972. There we<br />\nwere with our cotton candy, while<br />\nNixon had just mined Haiphong<br />\nHarbor. Perhaps two-hundred<br />\npeople departed the fair to hear<br />\nParren Mitchell decry the monster<br />\nin Nixon and in our military<br />\narrogance. I suppose that a Student<br />\nBody not offended by the Nixon<br />\npolicies in Vietnam at that point<br />\ncould hardly be expected to<br />\ncriticize anything\u2014even their own<br />\nacademic environment. I'm not<br />\nsaying members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity should forsake<br />\ninstitutional pride.

The 88-108<br />\nmegacycle band (between channels 6 and<br />\n7 on the TV) is well suited for this<br />\npurpose, sacrificing only range to line of<br />\nsight transmissions. This drawback has<br />\nmade FM's acceptance to the car radio<br />\nformat unpredictable and worth the cost<br />\nof FM-installation in a car only in a city<br />\nof major size and quality programming.<br />\nFM radio has therefore become a<br />\nformat restricted to the quality home<br />\nsystem or at least the second band of the<br />\nportable radio. Also the possibility of<br />\nstereo and even quadraphonic sound adds<br />\nto the possibilities of the \"elitists\" radio.<br />\nQuality stereo reception is dependent on<br />\nthe use of an antenna of sufficient merit<br />\nto provide signal separation, just as color<br />\nTV needs a better antenna. If you obtain<br />\na good antenna your troubles are still not<br />\nover as station quality is lacking to a<br />\ndegree not realized by most. True stereo<br />\nand quad are effective but lacking the<br />\nsophistication that is possible.<br />\n<br />\nFM radio was originally conceived as<br />\nprimarily a classical music venture that<br />\nwould provide the technical quality to<br />\nthose who so desired. Of course, classical<br />\nmusic could never fill the financial<br />\nrequirements of the commercial radio<br />\nstation, and the medium became quickly<br />\n\"tainted\" with\"inferior\" music. The<br />\ngroup of uncouth Bohemians who<br />\nlistened to this drivel soon filled these<br />\nsacred airwaves with more AM type<br />\nmusic, but until recently this shocking<br />\ncacophony was kept to as tasteful a level<br />\nas possible.<br />\nOf course this cacophony is simply the<br />\nmusic that most people listen to<br />\neveryday. For most of us Beethoven is<br />\njust too demanding to our attention. So<br />\nFM now offers progressive rock, easy<br />\nlistening, \"progressive\" country music,<br />\nand jazz, in addition to classical. The<br />\nword progressive itself was spawned<br />\nspecifically for FM in an attempt to gain<br />\nan elitist aura and remains to promote<br />\nsome semblance of quality programming.<br />\nSearching for decent FM stations is not<br />\nan easy task. Right away we can eliminate<br />\nthe easy-listening format. More than any<br />\nother type of programming this not-only<br />\ngrates on my ear, but insults my<br />\nintelligence as well. Dinner _nusic, or<br />\nbetter termed, elevator music, brings to<br />\nmind 1) eating in the Homewood Deli, 2)<br />\nriding in the elevator of a suburban<br />\ndepartment store, or 3) waiting for my<br />\nteeth to be pulled as the drill digs deep<br />\ninto the bicuspids of my dentist's current<br />\npatient. This music is so predictable with<br />\n<br />\nits Ray Coniff Choruses, Walter Wonderly<br />\norgans, and the 1001 strings, that it<br />\ngushes with more butter than is on that<br />\npotato, stuck in your throat at dinner. I<br />\nfind that most people who enjoy listening<br />\nto this music are either deaf, cardiac<br />\npatients, or more probably people who<br />\ndo not like to listen to music. This logic<br />\nof \"I put that music on so we could<br />\ntalk,\" or \"I don't listen to the radio, I<br />\njust keep it on for mood in the<br />\nbackground,\" escapes me as<br />\nmood-creating music must be heard and<br />\nto be properly heard must be listened to.<br />\nCountry music on FM seems out of<br />\nplace, as I feel that it is best suited to the<br />\nAM band. But my preferences have , led<br />\nme away from this probably acceptable<br />\nformat which strikes a bit too lush and<br />\ntwangy. Pleading ignorance I can<br />\ntherefore offer no suggestions on this, the<br />\nfunkiest of all musical forms.<br />\nClassical music is handled by WCAO,<br />\nWBAL, ,and WCBM. Classical<br />\nprogramming draws upon a limited<br />\nrepertoire (for those of you fresh out of<br />\nthe time warp they don't write classical<br />\nmusic any more). CAO probably has the<br />\nmost classical of the classical but this is<br />\npretty much in the mind of the listener.<br />\nSignal quality for the purists is about the<br />\nsame but with BAL and CAO offering a<br />\nslightly higher fi.<br />\nSome of you may see through me at<br />\nthis point. Having ridiculed, pleaded<br />\nignorance, and declined to judge I have<br />\nleft myself with the juicy plum of the<br />\nI here and now music.<br />\n<br />\nProgressive Rock and Jazz represent<br />\nthe music of the present and the hope for<br />\nfuture musical ventures. Here though,<br />\nBaltimore leaveswus hungry.<br />\n0 .9<br />\nThe biggy. Step right up and win<br />\nyourself a car just find the key and its<br />\nyours. Or so one of their games went.<br />\nProgressive? Hardly. Neither is their<br />\nprogramming. Somehow most people<br />\nlisten to KTK simply out of lack of<br />\nanything else to listen to. Their signal is<br />\nstrong but their signal is noisy as hell. The<br />\nworst thing is that Goddamn cart, dge<br />\nmachine. You just got through listening<br />\nto a quiet ballad that you like and you<br />\nturned the volume up, then POW here<br />\ncomes the commercial and your<br />\nheadphones go electric with 85 decibels<br />\nof tape hiss. Avoid the KTK trap at all<br />\ncosts if you can, but if you need your<br />\nadult minimum daily requirement of the<br />\nRolling Stones it is regrettably your best<br />\nbet.<br />\nWLPL, WDJQ 92 & 104<br />\nThese two second-rate rock stations are<br />\nnot much more than Top 40 stowaways.<br />\nPeriod.

The<br />\nopening took place two years later than<br />\nhad originally been planned, due to<br />\nconstruction problems and numerous<br />\nother difficulties, but, the impressive<br />\nfanfare and celebration of the opening<br />\nceremonies provided more than adequate<br />\ncompensation for the long wait. There<br />\nwere two galas, one on Thursday evening,<br />\nthe fourteenth of November, for<br />\nmembers of the Gallery and local guests,<br />\nand another on Friday the fifteenth, for<br />\nthe out-of-town guests and lenders to the<br />\nexhibits. Saturday marked the official<br />\nopening for the public. A ribbon cutting<br />\ncermony with Mayor Schaeffer officiating<br />\nwas followed by tours of the new gallery<br />\nspace, given by highly qualified and<br />\nwell-trained docents.<br />\nI had the good fortune to attend the<br />\nThursday evening ceremonies. Guests<br />\narrived in heavy coats and huddled under<br />\numbrellas, and fashionable ladies hopped<br />\nabout trying to avoid soaking the hems of<br />\nlong dresses in the massive puddles on<br />\nstreets and sidewalks outside the gallery.<br />\nIt appeared initially that fickle Nature<br />\nwould dampen the festival spirit. But.<br />\nonce one reached the Mount Vernor<br />\nPlace entrance, where great peals ot<br />\nmedieval trumpets sounded their<br />\ngreetings, one quickly forgot the rain and<br />\ngloom what with the warm and exciting<br />\natmosphere inside.<br />\nAfter a two year wait for the new wing<br />\nto open, a twenty minute wait in the<br />\nreception line seemed tolerable. Then, the<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\ntour of the new wing: our expectations<br />\nwere not disappointed. The new wing is,<br />\nin a word, fantastic. It represents a radical<br />\ndeparture from the conventional design<br />\nof. interior space in most museums.<br />\nTraditionally, museums have consisted of<br />\na series of rectangular galleries stemming<br />\nfrom an interior courtyard. The<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art and the<br />\nMetropolitan Museum of New York are<br />\nboth designed this way. as are countless<br />\nother major museum's. In this sort of<br />\ntraditional building, the visitor is<br />\ncontinually forced back inward. Not so in<br />\nthe new wing at the Walters. Although<br />\ntechnically there is a central core, one<br />\ndoesn't get the feeling of walking in the<br />\nusual circular path. There is great variety<br />\nin the structural design of each individual<br />\ngallery. Dropped floors and cul-de-sacs<br />\nwhich suddenly appear before the visitor,<br />\nramps and unusual lighting techniques, all<br />\nuse the architectural elements of the<br />\nbuilding to enhance the exhibits in a<br />\ndelightful and inspiring way. I especially<br />\nenjoyed the impressive exhibit of<br />\nmedieval tapestries, and the collection of<br />\nancient sarcophagi.<br />\nThe new wing has added 100,000<br />\nsquare feet of space to the Gallery, of<br />\nwhich about half will be for permanent<br />\nexhibitions. With this additional space, up<br />\nto eighty percent of the Walters<br />\ncollection will be on permanent display.<br />\nThis is indeed unusual and is something<br />\nof whch few museums anywhere can<br />\nboast.<br />\nAfter our brief look around the four<br />\nfloors of the new wing, we wandered<br />\nback downstairs to the main court, now<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\ndown Cathedral Street and drop you<br />\npractically atjhe door.<br />\nRecognition<br />\n<br />\ndevoid of its former, but nonetheless<br />\nfamiliar, clutter. There we enjoyed the<br />\nfestivities as waiters attired in full regalia<br />\nserved champagne and a variety of<br />\ncooking crepes. This was definitely an<br />\noccasion for .meeting and greeting, and<br />\nthe Gatsbyesque party was in full swing by<br />\nten o'clock. The champagne flowed freely<br />\nand all the \"right\" people were there,<br />\nmilling about and chattering excitedly.<br />\nThis is an exciting time for the Walters<br />\nArt Gallery, and I was happy to be able<br />\nto share in their newfound joy. The new<br />\nwing is well worth going to visit. Just<br />\ncatch the number 11 bus that stops in<br />\nfront of the University, on Charles Street<br />\nsouthbound. The bus will take you right<br />\n<br />\nNow perhaps the Walters Art Gallery<br />\nwill finally receive the recognition it<br />\ndeserves. As Richard Randall, the director<br />\nfo the Gallery, said earlier: \"I think the<br />\nhistory of the Walters is going to start<br />\nnow. The tragedy is. that for all these<br />\nyears we have not had our proper place in<br />\nthe reference works, and so on, because it<br />\ntakes a long time to be recognized. But,<br />\nwe are one of the seven greatest<br />\ncollections in the United States, and now<br />\nwe'll be able to show what we've got.<br />\nThat's what it means: first put the<br />\ncollection out\u2014then your life begins.\"<br />\n<br />\nWHUR: 'we'll be<br />\nblack in a minute'<br />\nresounding from page 10<br />\nWHFS, WMAL 102.3 & 107.3<br />\nWHFS, WMAL If you're interested in<br />\nputting up a super antenna and receiving<br />\nstations out of DC these are fine wide<br />\nselection progressive rock stations that<br />\ncan be depended upon.

In gearing up<br />\nfor its dual meet schedule, which<br />\ndoes not get into full swing until<br />\nafter the Christmas holidays, the<br />\nBlue Jay grapplers will<br />\nparticipate in the Millersville<br />\nOpen Tournament today and<br />\ntomorrow and also the Lebanon<br />\nValley Tournament on December<br />\n6 and 7.<br />\nOnly two losses, due to<br />\ngraduation, will cause the<br />\nHopkins grapplers some problems<br />\nin their lineup. Neil Hazard and<br />\nCraig Stevens finished their<br />\nwrestling careers last season.<br />\nBoth these wrestlers accounted<br />\nfor about 8 points per match for<br />\nthe Blue Jays, who averaged<br />\napproximately 23 points in each<br />\nof their dual meets. This amounts<br />\nto about one-third of their total<br />\noffense lost due to graduation.<br />\nHopkins will have to look<br />\nelsewhere to make up thai<br />\ndeficit.<br />\nAt 118 pounds, Steve Lazzaro<br />\nwil! be the probable starter.<br />\nLazzaro set offensive records for<br />\nthe Blnejays last year and should<br />\ncontinue to start eaci: match for<br />\nthe grapplers on a winning note.<br />\nIn his final season, at 126<br />\npounds, Ron Pucillo will be the<br />\nprobable starter. Pucillo brings<br />\nthree years of varsity experience<br />\ninto this season. Last season,<br />\nPucillo was used at 126 pounds, a<br />\nweight class above what he<br />\nwresteled the previous two years.<br />\nPucillo came in heavy this year<br />\nbut good conditioning and diet<br />\nhas allowed him to drop down to<br />\n126 pounds where he will stay<br />\nfor the duration of this season.<br />\nVaristy veteran Mike Privitera<br />\nwill probably be in the lineup at<br />\n134 pounds. Last year, Privitera<br />\nwas used both at 126 and 134<br />\npounds. This was due to injuries<br />\nthat plagued the Jays last year<br />\nand forced Coach Gotwals to<br />\nrevamp the lineup. Mike boasted<br />\na winning record last year at 126<br />\npounds but found the going<br />\ntougher at 134. This year,<br />\nPrivitera looks stronger which<br />\nshould allow him to be much<br />\nmore competitive at the higher<br />\nweight class.<br />\n<br />\nAnother senior grappler is<br />\nClark Kingery. Kingery will also<br />\nwrestle up a weight class over last<br />\nyear. He was the Blue Jays<br />\n134-pounder last season and had<br />\na very strong year. This season<br />\nKingery will fill the 142-pound<br />\nslot, a place where he saw<br />\ninfrequent action. With the<br />\nexperience he brings into this<br />\nseason, Kingery should be a very<br />\ntough performer for the Jays.<br />\nRoudning out the first five<br />\nweight-classes is another senior.<br />\nRobert -Fink Fink, also a varsity<br />\nveteran, will also be competing at<br />\na higher weight class than his<br />\nprevious year. Fink was the Jays<br />\n142-pounder but will see action<br />\nat 150 this year. As of this time,<br />\nFink is a doubtful starter for the<br />\nbeginning of the season, as he<br />\nsuffered a partially collapsed lung<br />\ninjury in a scrimmage with<br />\nHartford Community College.<br />\nBill Birmingham, also a senior,<br />\nis expected to improve on his last<br />\nyear's, record at 167 pounds. He<br />\nfaced some of the toughest<br />\nopponents in the league and<br />\nturned in some outstanding<br />\nperformances.<br />\nThe only Blue Jay who is<br />\nwrestling in a class below last<br />\nyear's is Gary Murza. Murza will<br />\ncompete this year at 190 pounds.<br />\nLast season, Murza wrestled<br />\nheavyweight and Neil Hazard<br />\ncompeted at 190.

Murza<br />\nwas one of the Jays biggest<br />\nscorers and is still trying to keep<br />\nhis dual meet winning streak alive<br />\nwhich spans the past two seasons.<br />\nThe only holes in the Bluejay<br />\nlineup are at 158, 177 and HWT.<br />\nBut Coach Gotwals has many<br />\nfreshmen prospects out this<br />\nseason which may help him fill in<br />\nsome of the holes. Andy Rindos<br />\n(150-158 pounder), Tom<br />\nLocraft, Tom Foley, Dan<br />\nKennedy, Joe Albanese and Lee<br />\nPilz, a sophomore, are all in the<br />\n134-142-150 pound range and<br />\nshould give Gotwals ample<br />\nmanpower to help shore up the<br />\n<br />\nweak spots.Also, Rick Hill, a<br />\nsenior, is out at 158 pounds,<br />\nalong with Eric Mulkey, a<br />\nfreshman. Robin Hiscock,<br />\nanother newcomer to both<br />\nHopkins and wrestling, is coming<br />\nalong well and has \"improved his<br />\nbest\" over all the newcomers.<br />\nHiscock is at 167 or 177. At<br />\nHWT is Lou Wolfin, a trackman<br />\nand weightlifter who has<br />\npotential.<br />\nGotwals feels he has good<br />\nexperience and good talent in his<br />\nlineup and is hopeful that his<br />\nlower weights can put in winning<br />\nperformances while both<br />\nBirmingham and Murza can also<br />\ndo a job for the Jays at their<br />\nspots.<br />\n<br />\nget involved. Kids from Hoplcins<br />\nwould come up here and paint up<br />\nthe blocking sled, smear up the<br />\nfield and write JHU on the<br />\nfield.\"<br />\nJones continued, \"But even if<br />\nstuff like that remains in the<br />\npast, the guys who are playing<br />\ndon't lose the spirit of it. The<br />\nrivalry starts with these guys<br />\nwhen they are freshman and<br />\nbuilds for four years.\"<br />\nLikewise Hopkins coach<br />\nDennis Cox also emphasized<br />\nlengthy rivalry.<br />\n\"We have played Western<br />\nMaryland longer (consecutively)<br />\nthan any other opponent The<br />\nrivalry stems from the<br />\n'de-emphasis' on football at both<br />\nschools, and the high academic<br />\nstandards which both schools<br />\nmaintain. Also there is an 'alumni<br />\ncommunity' rivalry because of<br />\nthe proximity of the two schools<br />\nand their graduates.\"<br />\nWestern Maryland is a young,<br />\ninexperienced squad (only 3<br />\nseniors) with a misleading 1-7<br />\nrecord. Three of their losses have<br />\nbeen by a total of 5 points. Look<br />\nfor Mark Mechak, Rich Heritage<br />\nand Rick Rosenfeld (all defensive<br />\nbacks) to lead the Terrors attack.<br />\nThe Blue Jays are currently<br />\nriding the crest of a two came<br />\nwinning and coming off their<br />\nbest game of the season.

The acceptance of<br />\nthis pact represented the<br />\nculmination of weeks of debate<br />\nand argument, in which<br />\nnumerous proposals were put<br />\nforth by SAC members<br />\nmodifying the original document<br />\ndrafted by SAC Executive<br />\nCommittee members Alan Fink,<br />\nAndrew Savitz, and Alan<br />\nSapakie, and submitted October<br />\n3.<br />\nDespite the overwhelming vote<br />\nfor ratification of the by-laws<br />\nand guidelines, dissent was heard<br />\nfrom certain SAC members,<br />\nincluding Sue Fino, who<br />\nsummarized her feelings by<br />\ncommenting,\"This document is a<br />\nmess.\"<br />\nFino alleged the by-laws and<br />\nguidelines were filled with<br />\ncontradictions and advised the<br />\nrewriting of the document with<br />\nresubmission to the SAC after<br />\nintersession:<br />\nAndrew Savitz, Student<br />\nCouncil President, expressed his<br />\nbelief that the by-laws and<br />\nguidelines contained problems,<br />\nblit these would be worked out<br />\nin time with their application.<br />\nMuch of the discussion at the<br />\nmeeting centered around the<br />\ninstitution of these by-laws and<br />\nguidelines as policy for the SAC.<br />\nThe pact must be submitted now<br />\nto theStudent Council for its<br />\napproval. Assuming they are<br />\naccepted by the Council, the<br />\nby-laws and guidelines would<br />\nthen be voted upon by students<br />\nin the form of a referendum.<br />\nCertain SAC members stressed<br />\nthe need for rapid action and<br />\nimplementation of the approved<br />\nrules and expressed<br />\ndisappointment when Savitz<br /><br />\nannounced that a referendum<br />\nwould not be held before the SC<br />\ngeneral elections, the first week<br />\nof March.<br />\nSavitz pointed out that the SC<br />\nwould not be able to come to a<br />\ndecision on these SAC by-laws<br />\nuntil the end of this semester. In<br />\nresponse to a proposal for staging<br />\na referendum coincident with<br />\nregistration at the beginning of<br />\nthe second semester, Savitz<br />\ncontended that this would<br />\ndeprive students of the<br />\nopportunity to evaluate the<br />\ndocument carefully. He<br />\nexpressed his belief that waiting a<br />\nnumber of weeks would obviate<br />\nthe difficulty associated with<br />\nstaging an additional referendum.<br />\nNevertheless, certain<br />\nresolutions were adopted by the<br />\nSAC concerning the<br />\nimplementation of the by-laws.<br />\nOne of these included a motion<br />\nto immediately institute the<br />\nprovisions of the document<br />\nshould it receive student approval<br />\nthrough the referendum.<br />\nAnother motion, put forth by<br />\nEdward Brokans, called upon the<br />\nSC to ts_mporarily' institute the<br /><br />\nEdward Brokans<br /><br />\nby-laws effective between the<br />\ntime the SC adopts them and the<br />\nstudent referendum. Both<br />\nresolutions were approved<br />\noverwhelmingly.<br />\nFollowing the various votes, as<br />\nChairman Fink was ready to<br />\nembark upon what he called \"the<br />\nreal purpose of the SAC,\" the<br />\nmeeting degenerated into a<br />\ndiscussion of Fink's \"disparaging<br />\nremarks\" concerning SAC<br />\nmembers whom he dubbed as<br />\n\"groping for power.\"<br />\nEdward Brokans expressed his<br />\npersonal dissatisfaction, calling<br />\nupon Fink to apologize for his<br />\nstatements. Fink refused to<br />\ncomment on this issue.<br /><br />\nThe specialized curriculum will<br />\nbe handled jointly by key<br />\nHomewood faculty and<br />\nprofessors from the School of<br />\nPublic Health and is theoretically<br />\nlimited to twenty-five students,<br />\naccording to Dan Holik, one of<br />\nthe three undergraduate members<br />\nof the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies (CUS)<br />\nwho presented the two proposals<br />\nto the Council.<br />\nThe CUS, a subcommittee of<br />\nthe \u2022Council, unanimously<br />\napproved the program at its<br />\nNovember 7 meeting.<br />\n\"Hopkins is the first school to<br />\nstart a program like this,\" Helik<br />\nasserted. \"It's basis is to get<br />\nqualified scientists in the public<br />\nhealth field.\"<br />\nGeorge Owen, Dean of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, stated, \"The<br />\nproposal passed with alot of<br />\nquestions and alot of discussion.\"<br />\nHolik revealed that most of<br />\nthe questions concerned the<br />\nresponsibility the Homewood<br />\nDivision would have in teaching<br />\nand funding the program. \"We<br />\nexplained that the increased<br />\nteaching load and funding would<br />\ncome from the School of Public<br />\nHealth,\" Holik said.<br />\nAcademic Council member Dr.<br />\nElias Rivers, Romance Languages<br />\nDepartment, commented that the<br />\nvote for the new major was<br />\nunanimous \"since we realized the<br />\nSchool of Public Health and<br />\nHygiene was willing to do the<br />\nextra work to get good majors.\"<br />\nHe added, \"It seems like a good<br />\nidea.\"<br />\nAfter examining the pass-fail<br /><br />\nfigures from last year the Council<br />\nalso voted to retain the alternatt<br />\ngrading policy.<br />\nHolik revealed that the report<br />\non pass-fail which he wrote with<br />\nDr. Fredrick Dierman,<br />\nUndergraduate Coordinator of<br />\nAdvising and Counseling, \"shows<br />\nthat students used pass-fail to<br />\nexpand their breadth of courses.\"<br />\n3ption<br />\nHe added that although most<br />\ngraduate school associate a<br />\n\"Pass\" with a \"C\" grade,<br />\nstatistics show that \"at Hopkins<br />\nthere is good chance that the<br />\ngrade is a 'B' or an `A'.\"<br />\nAlthough Holik stated that the<br />\nCouncil seemed very pleased with<br />\nthe report and no Council<br />\nmembers voiced objections on<br />\ncontinuing the option,. Rivers<br />\nsaid, \"Some members had<br />\nreservations on the principle, of<br />\npass-fail.\" However, they were in<br />\nthe minority, he stipulated.<br />\nCouncil members also<br />\ndiscussed possible changes in the<br />\ngrading policy for first semester<br />\nfreshmen, which is now open<br />\nentirely pass-fail.<br />\n\"There is sometimes pressure<br />\nlater to release freshman grades<br />\nto grad schools,\" Rivers said.<br />\n\"We want to stablize a policy<br />\nthat will please most students.\"<br />\nThe Council was informed that<br />\nDr. Richard Fried of Harvard<br />\nUniversity has accepted a<br />\nposition in the Humanities<br />\nCenter and the History of Art<br />\nDept.

Thinking of then and now,<br />\nas I did in the Glass Pavillion, I was<br />\ndisturbed by the absence of several<br />\nfaces. I tried for a moment to<br />\ncompare the 1975 Hullabaloo with<br />\nthe 1971-72 Pig Book (out of<br />\nprint). I was troubled by the<br />\nnotoriety of the \"dropouts,\" there<br />\nwere thieves, junkies, and suicide<br />\nvictims. Those were the faces that<br />\nassailed the innocence of the<br />\nHopkins Pig Book, they are the<br />\nsame faces, hardly forgotten, that<br />\nwill rebuke the noble academic<br />\nachievement represented by the<br />\n1975 Hullabaloo and<br />\ncommencement.

At best, he is<br />\nthought of as a criminal student, or<br />\nis remembered as a victim of<br />\nintellectual suicide. I tried to talk<br />\nto Bill Abbott about his<br />\nexperiences of late. I was inspired<br /><br />\nby a photograph of J.D. Salinger<br />\nappearing in a recent Newsweek.<br />\nSalinger is one who guards his<br />\nprivacy well, and I thought of Bill<br />\nAbbott in this respect. Abbott<br />\ndidn't think Of Hopkins as the<br />\nideal intellectual existence it is<br />\nfashioned to be, and he treasured<br />\nthis opinion. Abbott never made it<br />\nin the Gate. House as<br />\nEditor-in-Chief, and we know what<br />\nthe paper would have been like if<br />\nhe stayed for one more year. In the<br />\ncareer of the class of 1975, Bill<br />\nAbbott wrote an array of articles<br />\ncovering such topics as the federal<br />\nand state funding of private<br />\nuniversities. He interview Walter<br />\nCronkite, Russell Baker, and he<br />\nspoke with Dr. Muller on several<br />\noccassions. We remember best an<br />\ninterview with President Muller<br />\nabout his friends at USC: Bob<br />\nHaldeman,and John Erlichman.

The 88-108<br />\nmegacycle band (between channels 6 and<br />\n7 on the TV) is well suited for this<br />\npurpose, sacrificing only range to line of<br />\nsight transmissions. This drawback has<br />\nmade FM's acceptance to the car radio<br />\nformat unpredictable and worth the cost<br />\nof FM-installation in a car only in a city<br />\nof major size and quality programming.<br />\nFM radio has therefore become a<br />\nformat restricted to the quality home<br />\nsystem or at least the second band of the<br />\nportable radio. Also the possibility of<br />\nstereo and even quadraphonic sound adds<br />\nto the possibilities of the \"elitists\" radio.<br />\nQuality stereo reception is dependent on<br />\nthe use of an antenna of sufficient merit<br />\nto provide signal separation, just as color<br />\nTV needs a better antenna. If you obtain<br />\na good antenna your troubles are still not<br />\nover as station quality is lacking to a<br />\ndegree not realized by most. True stereo<br />\nand quad are effective but lacking the<br />\nsophistication that is possible.<br /><br />\nFM radio was originally conceived as<br />\nprimarily a classical music venture that<br />\nwould provide the technical quality to<br />\nthose who so desired. Of course, classical<br />\nmusic could never fill the financial<br />\nrequirements of the commercial radio<br />\nstation, and the medium became quickly<br />\n\"tainted\" with\"inferior\" music. The<br />\ngroup of uncouth Bohemians who<br />\nlistened to this drivel soon filled these<br />\nsacred airwaves with more AM type<br />\nmusic, but until recently this shocking<br />\ncacophony was kept to as tasteful a level<br />\nas possible.<br />\nOf course this cacophony is simply the<br />\nmusic that most people listen to<br />\neveryday. For most of us Beethoven is<br />\njust too demanding to our attention. So<br />\nFM now offers progressive rock, easy<br />\nlistening, \"progressive\" country music,<br />\nand jazz, in addition to classical. The<br />\nword progressive itself was spawned<br />\nspecifically for FM in an attempt to gain<br />\nan elitist aura and remains to promote<br />\nsome semblance of quality programming.<br />\nSearching for decent FM stations is not<br />\nan easy task. Right away we can eliminate<br />\nthe easy-listening format. More than any<br />\nother type of programming this not-only<br />\ngrates on my ear, but insults my<br />\nintelligence as well. Dinner _nusic, or<br />\nbetter termed, elevator music, brings to<br />\nmind 1) eating in the Homewood Deli, 2)<br />\nriding in the elevator of a suburban<br />\ndepartment store, or 3) waiting for my<br />\nteeth to be pulled as the drill digs deep<br />\ninto the bicuspids of my dentist's current<br />\npatient. This music is so predictable with<br /><br />\nits Ray Coniff Choruses, Walter Wonderly<br />\norgans, and the 1001 strings, that it<br />\ngushes with more butter than is on that<br />\npotato, stuck in your throat at dinner. I<br />\nfind that most people who enjoy listening<br />\nto this music are either deaf, cardiac<br />\npatients, or more probably people who<br />\ndo not like to listen to music. This logic<br />\nof \"I put that music on so we could<br />\ntalk,\" or \"I don't listen to the radio, I<br />\njust keep it on for mood in the<br />\nbackground,\" escapes me as<br />\nmood-creating music must be heard and<br />\nto be properly heard must be listened to.<br />\nCountry music on FM seems out of<br />\nplace, as I feel that it is best suited to the<br />\nAM band. But my preferences have , led<br />\nme away from this probably acceptable<br />\nformat which strikes a bit too lush and<br />\ntwangy. Pleading ignorance I can<br />\ntherefore offer no suggestions on this, the<br />\nfunkiest of all musical forms.<br />\nClassical music is handled by WCAO,<br />\nWBAL, ,and WCBM. Classical<br />\nprogramming draws upon a limited<br />\nrepertoire (for those of you fresh out of<br />\nthe time warp they don't write classical<br />\nmusic any more). CAO probably has the<br />\nmost classical of the classical but this is<br />\npretty much in the mind of the listener.<br />\nSignal quality for the purists is about the<br />\nsame but with BAL and CAO offering a<br />\nslightly higher fi.<br />\nSome of you may see through me at<br />\nthis point. Having ridiculed, pleaded<br />\nignorance, and declined to judge I have<br />\nleft myself with the juicy plum of the<br />\nI here and now music.<br /><br />\nProgressive Rock and Jazz represent<br />\nthe music of the present and the hope for<br />\nfuture musical ventures. Here though,<br />\nBaltimore leaveswus hungry.<br />\n0 .9<br />\nThe biggy. Step right up and win<br />\nyourself a car just find the key and its<br />\nyours. Or so one of their games went.<br />\nProgressive? Hardly. Neither is their<br />\nprogramming. Somehow most people<br />\nlisten to KTK simply out of lack of<br />\nanything else to listen to. Their signal is<br />\nstrong but their signal is noisy as hell. The<br />\nworst thing is that Goddamn cart, dge<br />\nmachine. You just got through listening<br />\nto a quiet ballad that you like and you<br />\nturned the volume up, then POW here<br />\ncomes the commercial and your<br />\nheadphones go electric with 85 decibels<br />\nof tape hiss. Avoid the KTK trap at all<br />\ncosts if you can, but if you need your<br />\nadult minimum daily requirement of the<br />\nRolling Stones it is regrettably your best<br />\nbet.<br />\nWLPL, WDJQ 92 &amp; 104<br />\nThese two second-rate rock stations are<br />\nnot much more than Top 40 stowaways.<br />\nPeriod.

The<br />\nopening took place two years later than<br />\nhad originally been planned, due to<br />\nconstruction problems and numerous<br />\nother difficulties, but, the impressive<br />\nfanfare and celebration of the opening<br />\nceremonies provided more than adequate<br />\ncompensation for the long wait. There<br />\nwere two galas, one on Thursday evening,<br />\nthe fourteenth of November, for<br />\nmembers of the Gallery and local guests,<br />\nand another on Friday the fifteenth, for<br />\nthe out-of-town guests and lenders to the<br />\nexhibits. Saturday marked the official<br />\nopening for the public. A ribbon cutting<br />\ncermony with Mayor Schaeffer officiating<br />\nwas followed by tours of the new gallery<br />\nspace, given by highly qualified and<br />\nwell-trained docents.<br />\nI had the good fortune to attend the<br />\nThursday evening ceremonies. Guests<br />\narrived in heavy coats and huddled under<br />\numbrellas, and fashionable ladies hopped<br />\nabout trying to avoid soaking the hems of<br />\nlong dresses in the massive puddles on<br />\nstreets and sidewalks outside the gallery.<br />\nIt appeared initially that fickle Nature<br />\nwould dampen the festival spirit. But.<br />\nonce one reached the Mount Vernor<br />\nPlace entrance, where great peals ot<br />\nmedieval trumpets sounded their<br />\ngreetings, one quickly forgot the rain and<br />\ngloom what with the warm and exciting<br />\natmosphere inside.<br />\nAfter a two year wait for the new wing<br />\nto open, a twenty minute wait in the<br />\nreception line seemed tolerable. Then, the<br />\n/<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\ntour of the new wing: our expectations<br />\nwere not disappointed. The new wing is,<br />\nin a word, fantastic. It represents a radical<br />\ndeparture from the conventional design<br />\nof. interior space in most museums.<br />\nTraditionally, museums have consisted of<br />\na series of rectangular galleries stemming<br />\nfrom an interior courtyard. The<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art and the<br />\nMetropolitan Museum of New York are<br />\nboth designed this way. as are countless<br />\nother major museum's. In this sort of<br />\ntraditional building, the visitor is<br />\ncontinually forced back inward. Not so in<br />\nthe new wing at the Walters. Although<br />\ntechnically there is a central core, one<br />\ndoesn't get the feeling of walking in the<br />\nusual circular path. There is great variety<br />\nin the structural design of each individual<br />\ngallery. Dropped floors and cul-de-sacs<br />\nwhich suddenly appear before the visitor,<br />\nramps and unusual lighting techniques, all<br />\nuse the architectural elements of the<br />\nbuilding to enhance the exhibits in a<br />\ndelightful and inspiring way. I especially<br />\nenjoyed the impressive exhibit of<br />\nmedieval tapestries, and the collection of<br />\nancient sarcophagi.<br />\nThe new wing has added 100,000<br />\nsquare feet of space to the Gallery, of<br />\nwhich about half will be for permanent<br />\nexhibitions. With this additional space, up<br />\nto eighty percent of the Walters<br />\ncollection will be on permanent display.<br />\nThis is indeed unusual and is something<br />\nof whch few museums anywhere can<br />\nboast.<br />\nAfter our brief look around the four<br />\nfloors of the new wing, we wandered<br />\nback downstairs to the main court, now<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\ndown Cathedral Street and drop you<br />\npractically atjhe door.<br />\nRecognition<br /><br />\ndevoid of its former, but nonetheless<br />\nfamiliar, clutter. There we enjoyed the<br />\nfestivities as waiters attired in full regalia<br />\nserved champagne and a variety of<br />\ncooking crepes. This was definitely an<br />\noccasion for .meeting and greeting, and<br />\nthe Gatsbyesque party was in full swing by<br />\nten o'clock. The champagne flowed freely<br />\nand all the \"right\" people were there,<br />\nmilling about and chattering excitedly.<br />\nThis is an exciting time for the Walters<br />\nArt Gallery, and I was happy to be able<br />\nto share in their newfound joy. The new<br />\nwing is well worth going to visit. Just<br />\ncatch the number 11 bus that stops in<br />\nfront of the University, on Charles Street<br />\nsouthbound. The bus will take you right<br /><br />\nNow perhaps the Walters Art Gallery<br />\nwill finally receive the recognition it<br />\ndeserves. As Richard Randall, the director<br />\nfo the Gallery, said earlier: \"I think the<br />\nhistory of the Walters is going to start<br />\nnow. The tragedy is. that for all these<br />\nyears we have not had our proper place in<br />\nthe reference works, and so on, because it<br />\ntakes a long time to be recognized. But,<br />\nwe are one of the seven greatest<br />\ncollections in the United States, and now<br />\nwe'll be able to show what we've got.<br />\nThat's what it means: first put the<br />\ncollection out\u2014then your life begins.\"<br /><br />\nWHUR: 'we'll be<br />\nblack in a minute'<br />\nresounding from page 10<br />\nWHFS, WMAL 102.3 &amp; 107.3<br />\nWHFS, WMAL If you're interested in<br />\nputting up a super antenna and receiving<br />\nstations out of DC these are fine wide<br />\nselection progressive rock stations that<br />\ncan be depended upon.

Since these games<br />\nusually climax the season,<br />\nrecords are thrown out the<br />\nwindow and underdogs are<br />\nprimed for upsets.

Though on<br />\na relatively smaller scale than the<br />\nother games mentioned, the<br />\nfeelings (especially amongst the<br />\nplayers) run equally high.<br />\n\"As far as the rivalry with<br />\nHopkins is concerned, that hasn't<br />\nchanged in the 17 years I've<br />\ncoached at Western Maryland,\"<br />\nsaid Terrors coach Ron Jones.<br />\n\"On the field, that is,\" he<br />\ncorrected. \"It's different with the<br />\nstudent body.

In gearing up<br />\nfor its dual meet schedule, which<br />\ndoes not get into full swing until<br />\nafter the Christmas holidays, the<br />\nBlue Jay grapplers will<br />\nparticipate in the Millersville<br />\nOpen Tournament today and<br />\ntomorrow and also the Lebanon<br />\nValley Tournament on December<br />\n6 and 7.<br />\nOnly two losses, due to<br />\ngraduation, will cause the<br />\nHopkins grapplers some problems<br />\nin their lineup. Neil Hazard and<br />\nCraig Stevens finished their<br />\nwrestling careers last season.<br />\nBoth these wrestlers accounted<br />\nfor about 8 points per match for<br />\nthe Blue Jays, who averaged<br />\napproximately 23 points in each<br />\nof their dual meets. This amounts<br />\nto about one-third of their total<br />\noffense lost due to graduation.<br />\nHopkins will have to look<br />\nelsewhere to make up thai<br />\ndeficit.<br />\nAt 118 pounds, Steve Lazzaro<br />\nwil! be the probable starter.<br />\nLazzaro set offensive records for<br />\nthe Blnejays last year and should<br />\ncontinue to start eaci: match for<br />\nthe grapplers on a winning note.<br />\nIn his final season, at 126<br />\npounds, Ron Pucillo will be the<br />\nprobable starter. Pucillo brings<br />\nthree years of varsity experience<br />\ninto this season. Last season,<br />\nPucillo was used at 126 pounds, a<br />\nweight class above what he<br />\nwresteled the previous two years.<br />\nPucillo came in heavy this year<br />\nbut good conditioning and diet<br />\nhas allowed him to drop down to<br />\n126 pounds where he will stay<br />\nfor the duration of this season.<br />\nVaristy veteran Mike Privitera<br />\nwill probably be in the lineup at<br />\n134 pounds. Last year, Privitera<br />\nwas used both at 126 and 134<br />\npounds. This was due to injuries<br />\nthat plagued the Jays last year<br />\nand forced Coach Gotwals to<br />\nrevamp the lineup. Mike boasted<br />\na winning record last year at 126<br />\npounds but found the going<br />\ntougher at 134. This year,<br />\nPrivitera looks stronger which<br />\nshould allow him to be much<br />\nmore competitive at the higher<br />\nweight class.<br /><br />\nAnother senior grappler is<br />\nClark Kingery. Kingery will also<br />\nwrestle up a weight class over last<br />\nyear. He was the Blue Jays<br />\n134-pounder last season and had<br />\na very strong year. This season<br />\nKingery will fill the 142-pound<br />\nslot, a place where he saw<br />\ninfrequent action. With the<br />\nexperience he brings into this<br />\nseason, Kingery should be a very<br />\ntough performer for the Jays.<br />\nRoudning out the first five<br />\nweight-classes is another senior.<br />\nRobert -Fink Fink, also a varsity<br />\nveteran, will also be competing at<br />\na higher weight class than his<br />\nprevious year. Fink was the Jays<br />\n142-pounder but will see action<br />\nat 150 this year. As of this time,<br />\nFink is a doubtful starter for the<br />\nbeginning of the season, as he<br />\nsuffered a partially collapsed lung<br />\ninjury in a scrimmage with<br />\nHartford Community College.<br />\nBill Birmingham, also a senior,<br />\nis expected to improve on his last<br />\nyear's, record at 167 pounds. He<br />\nfaced some of the toughest<br />\nopponents in the league and<br />\nturned in some outstanding<br />\nperformances.<br />\nThe only Blue Jay who is<br />\nwrestling in a class below last<br />\nyear's is Gary Murza. Murza will<br />\ncompete this year at 190 pounds.<br />\nLast season, Murza wrestled<br />\nheavyweight and Neil Hazard<br />\ncompeted at 190. This year,<br />\nMurza feels he can be more i<br /><br />\nBIA Basketball<br />\nRosters for BIA basketball<br />\nmust be turned in to the Athletic<br />\nOffice before December 15.

Murza<br />\nwas one of the Jays biggest<br />\nscorers and is still trying to keep<br />\nhis dual meet winning streak alive<br />\nwhich spans the past two seasons.<br />\nThe only holes in the Bluejay<br />\nlineup are at 158, 177 and HWT.<br />\nBut Coach Gotwals has many<br />\nfreshmen prospects out this<br />\nseason which may help him fill in<br />\nsome of the holes. Andy Rindos<br />\n(150-158 pounder), Tom<br />\nLocraft, Tom Foley, Dan<br />\nKennedy, Joe Albanese and Lee<br />\nPilz, a sophomore, are all in the<br />\n134-142-150 pound range and<br />\nshould give Gotwals ample<br />\nmanpower to help shore up the<br /><br />\nweak spots.Also, Rick Hill, a<br />\nsenior, is out at 158 pounds,<br />\nalong with Eric Mulkey, a<br />\nfreshman. Robin Hiscock,<br />\nanother newcomer to both<br />\nHopkins and wrestling, is coming<br />\nalong well and has \"improved his<br />\nbest\" over all the newcomers.<br />\nHiscock is at 167 or 177. At<br />\nHWT is Lou Wolfin, a trackman<br />\nand weightlifter who has<br />\npotential.<br />\nGotwals feels he has good<br />\nexperience and good talent in his<br />\nlineup and is hopeful that his<br />\nlower weights can put in winning<br />\nperformances while both<br />\nBirmingham and Murza can also<br />\ndo a job for the Jays at their<br />\nspots.<br /><br />\nget involved. Kids from Hoplcins<br />\nwould come up here and paint up<br />\nthe blocking sled, smear up the<br />\nfield and write JHU on the<br />\nfield.\"<br />\nJones continued, \"But even if<br />\nstuff like that remains in the<br />\npast, the guys who are playing<br />\ndon't lose the spirit of it. The<br />\nrivalry starts with these guys<br />\nwhen they are freshman and<br />\nbuilds for four years.\"<br />\nLikewise Hopkins coach<br />\nDennis Cox also emphasized<br />\nlengthy rivalry.<br />\n\"We have played Western<br />\nMaryland longer (consecutively)<br />\nthan any other opponent The<br />\nrivalry stems from the<br />\n'de-emphasis' on football at both<br />\nschools, and the high academic<br />\nstandards which both schools<br />\nmaintain. Also there is an 'alumni<br />\ncommunity' rivalry because of<br />\nthe proximity of the two schools<br />\nand their graduates.\"<br />\nWestern Maryland is a young,<br />\ninexperienced squad (only 3<br />\nseniors) with a misleading 1-7<br />\nrecord. Three of their losses have<br />\nbeen by a total of 5 points. Look<br />\nfor Mark Mechak, Rich Heritage<br />\nand Rick Rosenfeld (all defensive<br />\nbacks) to lead the Terrors attack.<br />\nThe Blue Jays are currently<br />\nriding the crest of a two came<br />\nwinning and coming off their<br />\nbest game of the season. A win<br />\nover Western Maryland will life<br />\ntheir 3-4-1 slate to the .500 mark<br />\nand thus salvage a season that<br />\nsome thought to be 1st during a<br />\nmidseason slump which saw the<br />\nJays suffer through a 5-game<br />\nnon-winning streak.<br /><br />\nSun still shines for Jay hooters<br />\nBy JOHN BLOOMENTHAL<br />\nAlthough there are those who<br />\nwould greet a 5-7-2 record with<br />\noaths of cloud and doom, it is<br />\nworth noting that the sun also<br />\nrises in Baltimore.
