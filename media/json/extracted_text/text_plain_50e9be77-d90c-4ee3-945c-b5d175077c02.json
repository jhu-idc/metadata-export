L., British Ambassador to the United States, Delivers<br />\nOration and Receives Degree<br />\nof Doctor of Laws.<br />\n<br />\nWith all the ceremonial pomp<br />\npossible to an institution, which can<br />\nboast of a past but little exceeding<br />\na generation\u2014a period of time<br />\nwhich not even in this country suffices for the flowering of tradition\u2014thel-ohns Hopkins University<br />\ncelebrated its thirty-fifth anniversary on Commemoration Day. The<br />\noccasion was perhaps the most bri:liant in the history of the University. The ceremonies were held in<br />\nthe Lyric Theatre. The stage upon<br />\nwhich so many Hopkins students<br />\nhad recently tripped to the light<br />\ntunes of \"Professor Napoleon\" was<br />\nconverted into a palm-enframed<br />\namphitheatre for the enthronement<br />\nof grave professors.<br />\nAt x i o'clock the ceremonies began. The procession of those who<br />\nwere to participate in the exercises<br />\nentered. The marshal, Dr. Edward<br />\nB. Matthews,led the way. Next followed President Remsen, and the<br />\nvenerable orafor of the day, gorgeous in the insignia of the University of Oxford; the mayor of the<br />\ncity; the dean; the chaplain; and,<br />\nlastly, the long line of the faculty,<br />\nwhose hoods and gowns displayed<br />\nthe various colors of all the principal universities of the world. The<br />\nprocession moved upon the stage<br />\nand was seated, and after a prayer<br />\nby the chaplain, Rev. J. Ross Stevenson, the president introduced the<br />\norator.<br />\nMr. Bryce is in person beginning<br />\nto show the marks of age. His<br />\nvoice, however, is still strong and<br />\nclear and his utterance is graceful<br />\nand fluent. He chose for his subject one of the most vital questions<br />\nto higher education today\u2014the conflict between specialization and latitude of culture. He began by remarking the gceat influence which<br />\nthe Hopkins has had in giving to<br />\nuniversity training in the Englishspeaking countries the direction<br />\nwhich it now pursues; and he then<br />\nreferred to some of the obvious<br />\nfaults into which that direction has<br />\nled. Specialization in some particular department of human knowledge, he remarked, is absolutely<br />\nnecessary to the student of today.<br />\nThe present problem is how to reconcile such specialization with<br />\nscholarly broad-mindedness. He indicated a course of studies which he<br />\nthought would procure such a result, and would at once convince the<br />\nscientist that many things, being<br />\nmutable and transient, cannot be<br />\nsubjected to permanent laws, and<br />\nthe student of the humanities on the<br />\nother hand, that certain facts are<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., FEBRUARY 27, 1911.<br />\nfixed and definite. After all, he said,<br />\nknowledge in one particular specialty seldom proves of any pi actical<br />\nuse unless other knowledge of a<br />\nwidely different variety can be<br />\nbrought to bear upon it to form a<br />\nnovel combination. When Mr.<br />\nBryce had concluded his address he<br />\nwas presented for the degree of<br />\ndoctor of laws by Prof. Westel W.<br />\nWilloughby in a brief speech of<br />\npraise. The degree was duly conferred by President Remsen.<br />\nThe second speaker of the day.<br />\nwas Mr. B. Howell Griswold, chairman of the committee on endowment and extension, and within the<br />\nlast few days elected a trustee of<br />\nthe University. In a highly facetious<br />\nand graceful manner Mr. Griswold sketched the methods which<br />\nthe committee had employed in collecting the recent million dollar fund<br />\nand the success with which they had<br />\nbeen met. His freauent sallies were<br />\nroundly applauded by the audience,<br />\nand the faculty joined in heartily<br />\nwhen he remarked that \"large sums<br />\nof money are things known to Hopkins professors chiefly by hearsay.\"<br />\nWhen Mr. Griswold had done reporting on the collection of the fund<br />\nMr. R. Brent Keyser, president of<br />\nthe board of trustees, briefly detailed the plans for its distribution.<br />\nContracts will be let in the immediate future, he stated, for the erection of Gilman Memorial Hall at<br />\nHomewood. When this building is<br />\nunder way, work on a new McCoy<br />\nHall will be commenced; two or<br />\nmore laboratory buildings will be<br />\nerected as soon as possible; and it<br />\nmay be confidently expected that<br />\nthe freshmen class which enters the<br />\nHopkins next autumn will be graduated from the new university at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nA change in the. management of<br />\nthe Hospital was announced by<br />\nPresident Remsen, and Judge<br />\nHenry Harlan was called upon to<br />\nrelate the details. Dr. Henry M.<br />\nHurd, Judge Harlan announced, for<br />\ntwenty-two years superintendent of<br />\nthe Hospital, had handed in his<br />\nresignation, which had been acceoted. An agreement had been reached whereby Dr. Hurd was to continue his connecton with the institution as secretary of the Hospital<br />\nand adviser to the board of trustees,<br />\nand the superintendency had been<br />\naccepted by Dr. Wilfred M. Smith.<br />\nA native of Maine and a young<br />\nman, Dr. Smith received his degree<br />\nof A. B. at Bowdoin College in<br />\n1899. Tn 1903 he received the degree of M.

In the gathering were men<br />\nwho had made their mark in medicine; who had won recognition, not<br />\nonly in Baltimore as men of medical<br />\nscience, but nationally; who paid<br />\nhonor to the man the force of whose<br />\ninfluence they had felt.<br />\nAs an enduring memorial to him<br />\nhis friends desired to mark the<br />\nevent in some way. It was accordingly decided that Cecilia Beaux,<br />\nthe noted artist, be commissioned to<br />\npaint his portrait for the Universit,r.<br />\nThe portrait, which is an excellent resemblance, was presented to,<br />\nthe University at the banquet by<br />\nDr. Reid Hunt, a former student of<br />\nDr. Howell, connected with the<br />\nMarine Hospital at Washington. It<br />\nwill be placed in McCoy Hall.<br />\nThe portrait was admired by<br />\nthe large gathering, and when it<br />\nwas presented the University Dr.<br />\nRemsen gracefully thanked the students who had given it, declaring<br />\nthat it would be placed in McCoy<br />\nHall, in the midst of the group of<br />\nmen who became famous when associated with Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe banquet was arranged by Dr.<br />\nWilliam H.

All present immediately arose, and, amid prolonged<br />\ncheers, the Ambassador was escorted to a seat at the speakers' table.<br />\nDr. Williams then finished announcing the election results, which<br />\nwas as follows:<br />\nPresident, Kirby F. Smith, Ph.<br />\nD., 1889; secretary, William Sherman Bansemer, A. B., 180r,; treasurer, Horace Edgar Flack, Ph.

Dr. Williams also<br />\nannounced the results of the election to the Alumni Council. These<br />\nwere: From the Ph. D. group, Dr.<br />\nE. R. L. Gould, of New York city;<br />\nfrom the M.

All of<br />\nthe amendments to the constitution,<br />\nincluding the one providing for the<br />\npublication of an alumni magazine,<br />\nwere passed by large majorities.<br />\nBefore he introduced the speakers, Dr. Williams made a few brief<br />\nremarks concerning the raising of<br />\nthe Homewood fund. He said that<br />\nthe A. B.'s of the university had<br />\ncontributed the most per capita;<br />\nthat the Ph.

But it isn't<br />\nenough merely to appoint early<br />\npractices. The practices must be<br />\nattended, and regularly too, by<br />\nevery member of the squad.

And from then<br />\non, during all the remainder of<br />\nexercises, they sat there making<br />\nwould-be jokes and laughing and<br />\ntalking so that no one around could<br />\nhear a word the speaker was saying. After about fifteen minutes<br />\nof this, a gentleman sitting in front<br />\nof them turned around and asked<br />\nthem if they would mind being<br />\nquiet.<br />\nInstead of complying, however,<br />\nthey simply began making \"jokes\"<br />\nat the gentleman's expense. Finally,<br />\nat the end, when Dr. Remsen was<br />\nmaking the announcements, they<br />\nbecame louder than ever, so that the<br />\ngentleman, evidently in desperation,<br />\nasked them again to be quiet. But<br />\nto no purpose.<br />\nAfter the exercises were over, as<br />\nhe was, going out, I heard him remark td a lady and gentleman :<br />\n\"Well, I certainly am ashamed that<br />\nI ever graduated from the Johns<br />\nHopkins when I come to a meeting<br />\nlike this and see what ill-mannered<br />\nfellows they now have to,put in positions of honor. Why, do you<br />\nknow, that every one of those -fellows had on an usher's badge and<br />\nthat the head usher was among<br />\nthem! Yours truly,<br />\n\"SPEcTAToR.\"<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThe debate preliminaries this<br />\nweek have shown us that in spite<br />\nof a great deal of talent present<br />\namong us the greater number of<br />\nstudents appear indifferent to any<br />\nliterary activities. It is a shame<br />\nthat not more than four men contested for places on the senior team.<br />\nThere should have been seven or<br />\neight men out any way. It pleases<br />\nme to think that if we adopted some<br />\nof the customs prevalent in most<br />\nother American colleges and universities, that this trouble might,be<br />\nrectified to a certain extent. For<br />\ninstance, why cannot we have a literary society here. Such an association would be of great use in<br />\nmany ways. Different works of<br />\nliterature might be discussed and<br />\nwe might exchange ideas on various<br />\nsubjects in a way that it is not possible amidst the petty gossip of the<br />\nbasement barber shop between<br />\nclasses. The spirit of debate, too,<br />\nmight be fostered and the candidacy for the Varsity debating team<br />\nwould not be restricted to a mere<br />\nhandful. Discussion of the matter<br />\nwould be welcomed by<br />\nA DEBATER.<br />\n<br />\nThe Seniors helcl their banquet<br />\nlast Thursday evening at the New<br />\nHoward Hotel. It was an unusually successful affair, and exceeded<br />\nby far the expectations of even the<br />\nmost sanguine. Every one of the<br />\nspeeches was good, and the speakers said things that were worth<br />\nwhile, quite an unusual occurrence<br />\nat a class banquet. The thought<br />\nthat this was the last banquet made<br />\nthe men rather serious, but things<br />\nwere lively enough in spite of this.<br />\nIn the absence of \"Stoney,\" Eddie<br />\nHulburt spoke on athletics. In the<br />\ncourse of his remarks he used a<br />\nmetaphor, which will, no doubt, become classical. He was . speaking<br />\nof the gradual rise of the athletic<br />\nspirit at Hopkins and its triumph<br />\nover all obstacles. \"Like a turtle<br />\nit crawled from its retirement.<br />\nThen, spreading its wings, it soared -.\" Eddie sat down. The<br />\nother speeches wer all partly serious, partly humorous. Harry Lindell remarked that the subject of<br />\nhis toast, \"Class Spirit,\" was very<br />\nlarge, and since he was a little fellow it would be difficult for him to<br />\ncover it. Reaney 'Wolfe spoke<br />\nabout reunions, and urged the necessity of sticking together. Upon<br />\nhis sugestion a vote was taken, and<br />\nMcCabe, Stockett, and Murray appointed as a committee to see that a<br />\nreunion was held February 23,<br />\n1916. Every member of the class<br />\nis to be notified.<br />\nThe banquet was splendid, and<br />\nthanks is due to the committee for<br />\ntheir care in its arrangement.<br />\n<br />\nR. Q.

XV, NO. 20.<br />\nCOMMEMORATION DAY<br />\nJames Bryce, D. C. L., British Ambassador to the United States, Delivers<br />\nOration and Receives Degree<br />\nof Doctor of Laws.<br /><br />\nWith all the ceremonial pomp<br />\npossible to an institution, which can<br />\nboast of a past but little exceeding<br />\na generation\u2014a period of time<br />\nwhich not even in this country suffices for the flowering of tradition\u2014thel-ohns Hopkins University<br />\ncelebrated its thirty-fifth anniversary on Commemoration Day. The<br />\noccasion was perhaps the most bri:liant in the history of the University. The ceremonies were held in<br />\nthe Lyric Theatre. The stage upon<br />\nwhich so many Hopkins students<br />\nhad recently tripped to the light<br />\ntunes of \"Professor Napoleon\" was<br />\nconverted into a palm-enframed<br />\namphitheatre for the enthronement<br />\nof grave professors.<br />\nAt x i o'clock the ceremonies began. The procession of those who<br />\nwere to participate in the exercises<br />\nentered. The marshal, Dr. Edward<br />\nB. Matthews,led the way. Next followed President Remsen, and the<br />\nvenerable orafor of the day, gorgeous in the insignia of the University of Oxford; the mayor of the<br />\ncity; the dean; the chaplain; and,<br />\nlastly, the long line of the faculty,<br />\nwhose hoods and gowns displayed<br />\nthe various colors of all the principal universities of the world. The<br />\nprocession moved upon the stage<br />\nand was seated, and after a prayer<br />\nby the chaplain, Rev. J. Ross Stevenson, the president introduced the<br />\norator.<br />\nMr. Bryce is in person beginning<br />\nto show the marks of age. His<br />\nvoice, however, is still strong and<br />\nclear and his utterance is graceful<br />\nand fluent. He chose for his subject one of the most vital questions<br />\nto higher education today\u2014the conflict between specialization and latitude of culture. He began by remarking the gceat influence which<br />\nthe Hopkins has had in giving to<br />\nuniversity training in the Englishspeaking countries the direction<br />\nwhich it now pursues; and he then<br />\nreferred to some of the obvious<br />\nfaults into which that direction has<br />\nled. Specialization in some particular department of human knowledge, he remarked, is absolutely<br />\nnecessary to the student of today.<br />\nThe present problem is how to reconcile such specialization with<br />\nscholarly broad-mindedness. He indicated a course of studies which he<br />\nthought would procure such a result, and would at once convince the<br />\nscientist that many things, being<br />\nmutable and transient, cannot be<br />\nsubjected to permanent laws, and<br />\nthe student of the humanities on the<br />\nother hand, that certain facts are<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., FEBRUARY 27, 1911.<br />\nfixed and definite. After all, he said,<br />\nknowledge in one particular specialty seldom proves of any pi actical<br />\nuse unless other knowledge of a<br />\nwidely different variety can be<br />\nbrought to bear upon it to form a<br />\nnovel combination. When Mr.<br />\nBryce had concluded his address he<br />\nwas presented for the degree of<br />\ndoctor of laws by Prof. Westel W.<br />\nWilloughby in a brief speech of<br />\npraise. The degree was duly conferred by President Remsen.<br />\nThe second speaker of the day.<br />\nwas Mr. B. Howell Griswold, chairman of the committee on endowment and extension, and within the<br />\nlast few days elected a trustee of<br />\nthe University. In a highly facetious<br />\nand graceful manner Mr. Griswold sketched the methods which<br />\nthe committee had employed in collecting the recent million dollar fund<br />\nand the success with which they had<br />\nbeen met. His freauent sallies were<br />\nroundly applauded by the audience,<br />\nand the faculty joined in heartily<br />\nwhen he remarked that \"large sums<br />\nof money are things known to Hopkins professors chiefly by hearsay.\"<br />\nWhen Mr. Griswold had done reporting on the collection of the fund<br />\nMr. R. Brent Keyser, president of<br />\nthe board of trustees, briefly detailed the plans for its distribution.<br />\nContracts will be let in the immediate future, he stated, for the erection of Gilman Memorial Hall at<br />\nHomewood. When this building is<br />\nunder way, work on a new McCoy<br />\nHall will be commenced; two or<br />\nmore laboratory buildings will be<br />\nerected as soon as possible; and it<br />\nmay be confidently expected that<br />\nthe freshmen class which enters the<br />\nHopkins next autumn will be graduated from the new university at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nA change in the. management of<br />\nthe Hospital was announced by<br />\nPresident Remsen, and Judge<br />\nHenry Harlan was called upon to<br />\nrelate the details. Dr. Henry M.<br />\nHurd, Judge Harlan announced, for<br />\ntwenty-two years superintendent of<br />\nthe Hospital, had handed in his<br />\nresignation, which had been acceoted. An agreement had been reached whereby Dr. Hurd was to continue his connecton with the institution as secretary of the Hospital<br />\nand adviser to the board of trustees,<br />\nand the superintendency had been<br />\naccepted by Dr. Wilfred M. Smith.<br />\nA native of Maine and a young<br />\nman, Dr. Smith received his degree<br />\nof A. B. at Bowdoin College in<br />\n1899. Tn 1903 he received the degree of M. D. at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical School. He became an interne and afterward resident gynecologist at Lakeside Hospital,<br />\nCleveland, Ohio. Later he was connected with the Health Department<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col.'21<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nDR.

Smith Elected President<br />\nfor Ensuing Two Years \u2014 Alumni<br />\nCouncil Representatives Chosen.<br /><br />\n\u2022 On Tuesday evening a banquet<br />\nwas given at the Belvedere in honor<br />\nof Professor Howell, who recently<br />\nresigned as dean of the Medical<br />\nSchool. In the gathering were men<br />\nwho had made their mark in medicine; who had won recognition, not<br />\nonly in Baltimore as men of medical<br />\nscience, but nationally; who paid<br />\nhonor to the man the force of whose<br />\ninfluence they had felt.<br />\nAs an enduring memorial to him<br />\nhis friends desired to mark the<br />\nevent in some way. It was accordingly decided that Cecilia Beaux,<br />\nthe noted artist, be commissioned to<br />\npaint his portrait for the Universit,r.<br />\nThe portrait, which is an excellent resemblance, was presented to,<br />\nthe University at the banquet by<br />\nDr. Reid Hunt, a former student of<br />\nDr. Howell, connected with the<br />\nMarine Hospital at Washington. It<br />\nwill be placed in McCoy Hall.<br />\nThe portrait was admired by<br />\nthe large gathering, and when it<br />\nwas presented the University Dr.<br />\nRemsen gracefully thanked the students who had given it, declaring<br />\nthat it would be placed in McCoy<br />\nHall, in the midst of the group of<br />\nmen who became famous when associated with Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe banquet was arranged by Dr.<br />\nWilliam H.

All present immediately arose, and, amid prolonged<br />\ncheers, the Ambassador was escorted to a seat at the speakers' table.<br />\nDr. Williams then finished announcing the election results, which<br />\nwas as follows:<br />\nPresident, Kirby F.

Dr. Williams also<br />\nannounced the results of the election to the Alumni Council. These<br />\nwere: From the Ph. D. group, Dr.<br />\nE. R. L. Gould, of New York city;<br />\nfrom the M.

All of<br />\nthe amendments to the constitution,<br />\nincluding the one providing for the<br />\npublication of an alumni magazine,<br />\nwere passed by large majorities.<br />\nBefore he introduced the speakers, Dr. Williams made a few brief<br />\nremarks concerning the raising of<br />\nthe Homewood fund. He said that<br />\nthe A. B.'s of the university had<br />\ncontributed the most per capita;<br />\nthat the Ph. D.'s were next, and<br />\nthat the doctors of medicine the<br />\nleast.<br />\nAmbassador Bryce was then introduced and made a happy speech to<br />\nhis \"fellow alumni,\" as he called<br />\nthose present. He said that he<br />\nthought he was the youngest alumnus of the University, having received \u2022his degree in 1911, and that<br />\nhe wished now to thank the authorities for the honor which they had<br />\nconferred upon him.<br />\nMr. Levering elicited a veritable<br />\nstorm of applause when he turned<br />\nto Mayor Mahool and expressed the<br />\nhope that he would be mayor for<br /><br />\nGeorgetown Meet.<br /><br />\nIn the track meet, which takes<br />\nplace next Saturday at Georgetown,<br />\nHopkins will be well represented.<br />\nAlthough there are only eleven men<br />\ngoing down, each one is expected<br />\nto be a point winner.

A great<br />\ndeal of emphasis has been laid upon<br />\nthe \u2022fact that the schedule is<br />\na hard one and that the football team must have the sup-.<br />\nport of every undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate in order to pull through<br />\nsuccessfully. But we cannot repeat<br />\nit too often. The Navy game, as<br />\neveryone knows, is the first of the<br />\nseason. If we do not want to be<br />\n\u2022 swamped and disgraced forever we<br />\nmust begin practice at least two<br />\nweeks earlier. , It is absolutely<br />\nnecessary, on penalty of certain<br />\nfailure, to lay the plans now for<br />\nthe fall practices. But it isn't<br />\nenough merely to appoint early<br />\npractices. The practices must be<br />\nattended, and regularly too, by<br />\nevery member of the squad.

And from then<br />\non, during all the remainder of<br />\nexercises, they sat there making<br />\nwould-be jokes and laughing and<br />\ntalking so that no one around could<br />\nhear a word the speaker was saying. After about fifteen minutes<br />\nof this, a gentleman sitting in front<br />\nof them turned around and asked<br />\nthem if they would mind being<br />\nquiet.<br />\nInstead of complying, however,<br />\nthey simply began making \"jokes\"<br />\nat the gentleman's expense. Finally,<br />\nat the end, when Dr. Remsen was<br />\nmaking the announcements, they<br />\nbecame louder than ever, so that the<br />\ngentleman, evidently in desperation,<br />\nasked them again to be quiet. But<br />\nto no purpose.<br />\nAfter the exercises were over, as<br />\nhe was, going out, I heard him remark td a lady and gentleman :<br />\n\"Well, I certainly am ashamed that<br />\nI ever graduated from the Johns<br />\nHopkins when I come to a meeting<br />\nlike this and see what ill-mannered<br />\nfellows they now have to,put in positions of honor. Why, do you<br />\nknow, that every one of those -fellows had on an usher's badge and<br />\nthat the head usher was among<br />\nthem! Yours truly,<br />\n\"SPEcTAToR.\"<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThe debate preliminaries this<br />\nweek have shown us that in spite<br />\nof a great deal of talent present<br />\namong us the greater number of<br />\nstudents appear indifferent to any<br />\nliterary activities. It is a shame<br />\nthat not more than four men contested for places on the senior team.<br />\nThere should have been seven or<br />\neight men out any way. It pleases<br />\nme to think that if we adopted some<br />\nof the customs prevalent in most<br />\nother American colleges and universities, that this trouble might,be<br />\nrectified to a certain extent. For<br />\ninstance, why cannot we have a literary society here. Such an association would be of great use in<br />\nmany ways. Different works of<br />\nliterature might be discussed and<br />\nwe might exchange ideas on various<br />\nsubjects in a way that it is not possible amidst the petty gossip of the<br />\nbasement barber shop between<br />\nclasses. The spirit of debate, too,<br />\nmight be fostered and the candidacy for the Varsity debating team<br />\nwould not be restricted to a mere<br />\nhandful. Discussion of the matter<br />\nwould be welcomed by<br />\nA DEBATER.<br /><br />\nThe Seniors helcl their banquet<br />\nlast Thursday evening at the New<br />\nHoward Hotel. It was an unusually successful affair, and exceeded<br />\nby far the expectations of even the<br />\nmost sanguine. Every one of the<br />\nspeeches was good, and the speakers said things that were worth<br />\nwhile, quite an unusual occurrence<br />\nat a class banquet. The thought<br />\nthat this was the last banquet made<br />\nthe men rather serious, but things<br />\nwere lively enough in spite of this.<br />\nIn the absence of \"Stoney,\" Eddie<br />\nHulburt spoke on athletics. In the<br />\ncourse of his remarks he used a<br />\nmetaphor, which will, no doubt, become classical. He was . speaking<br />\nof the gradual rise of the athletic<br />\nspirit at Hopkins and its triumph<br />\nover all obstacles. \"Like a turtle<br />\nit crawled from its retirement.<br />\nThen, spreading its wings, it soared -.\" Eddie sat down. The<br />\nother speeches wer all partly serious, partly humorous. Harry Lindell remarked that the subject of<br />\nhis toast, \"Class Spirit,\" was very<br />\nlarge, and since he was a little fellow it would be difficult for him to<br />\ncover it. Reaney 'Wolfe spoke<br />\nabout reunions, and urged the necessity of sticking together. Upon<br />\nhis sugestion a vote was taken, and<br />\nMcCabe, Stockett, and Murray appointed as a committee to see that a<br />\nreunion was held February 23,<br />\n1916.
