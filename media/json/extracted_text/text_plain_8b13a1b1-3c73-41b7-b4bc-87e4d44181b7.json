A grant of $189,500<br />\nfrom the Spencer Foundation of<br />\nChicago, a private organization<br />\nthat specializes in funding<br />\nresearch in education, supports<br />\nthe project.<br />\nThe purpose of the project is<br />\nt hreefold. Researchers will try to<br />\ndetermine how many youngsters<br />\nthere are in the population who<br />\nare gifted in the verbal area, what<br />\nother abilities and interests<br />\nCharacterize them, and what kind<br />\nof assistance can be provided to<br />\nencourage the children.<br />\n\"There are some othet<br />\nquestions to which we'll be<br />\nseeking answers,\" Hogan<br />\ne xplained, \"For example, is<br />\nachievement in the humanities<br />\nnecessarily incompatible with<br />\nmathematical attainment? Why<br />\nar e citildren with humanistic<br />\n<br />\nability so much less visible in the<br />\npopulation than the<br />\nquantitatively gifted?

The challenge<br />\nand stimulation of accelerated<br />\nwork often proves to be<br />\nbeneficial<br />\nSimilar success is hoped for by<br />\n<br />\nHogan and his team; however,<br />\nthey expressed doubt that there<br />\nwill be as many verbally gifted<br />\nchildrm. Also, since verbal<br />\nability appears to result from<br />\nexperience more than<br />\nmathematical talent does, the<br />\nverbal talent may not be<br />\napparent at so early an age.<br />\nThe researchers are confident<br />\nthat they will locate more than<br />\nenough gifted students to make<br />\nthe project worthwhile.<br />\n<br />\n3400 Committee<br />\nfair will also feature a wide range<br />\nof musical and theatrical<br />\nentertainment, an antique car<br />\nshow and exhibits of arts and<br />\ncrafts by local artisans Ft the<br />\nGilman quad.<br />\nTile fair is slated to take place<br />\nthe weekend of April 13-15 and<br />\nwas planned to coincide with the<br />\nHopkins-Virginia lacrosse game<br />\non Saturday, April 14.<br />\n<br />\nSC recognizes two groups<br />\n<br />\nDr. Hogan<br />\nand human communications<br />\nexpert, and Roger Webb,<br />\nassistant professor of psychology<br />\nand specialist in intellectual<br />\ndevelopment of children.

Recently<br />\nMaryPIRG was granted $50 by<br />\nthe junior class to get started, but<br />\nLee requested an additional $150<br />\nfrom the Council for publicity<br />\nand other \"essentials.\"<br />\nLee reviewed the history of<br />\nPIRG and he discussed the<br />\nconcept of PIRG both nationally<br />\nand here at Hopkins. The<br />\norganization originated at the<br />\nUniversity of Oregon and there<br />\nare presently chapters in twelve<br />\nstates. MaryPIRG is being<br />\nconsidered at colleges throughout<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nIn order for a college chapter<br />\nto be established 51 percent of<br />\nthe student body of that college,<br />\n<br />\nor university must agree to tax<br />\nthemselves in the amount of $3<br />\nper person, according to Lee. He<br />\nstated that these funds will be<br />\nused to hire full-time<br />\nprofessionals, whose purpose will<br />\nbe to represent the paying<br />\nstudents in their public interest<br />\nproblems. Lee indicated that he<br />\nhoped for 10 to 12 full time<br />\nworkers in the state of Maryland.<br />\nIn addition to requesting<br />\n$150, Lee asked for a general<br />\nresolution saying that the<br />\nStudent Council recognizes<br />\nMaryPIRG and encourages<br />\nparticipation in the public<br />\nresearch group. The financial<br />\naward was approved by a large<br />\nmajority and the appropriation<br />\nitself served as a resolution that<br />\nthe Council recognizes the group<br />\non campus.<br />\nRebecca Love, administrative<br />\nofficer of the Hopkins Women'<br />\nCenter, presented the group's<br />\nconstitution requested that the<br />\ngroup be officially recognized<br />\nand be eligible to obtain<br />\nUniversity funds. The women's<br />\ngroup was unanimously<br />\n<br />\nrecognized by the Council, but<br />\nfunds will be dealt out by the<br />\nStudent Activities Committee.<br />\nDean Robert Fitzpatrick spoke<br />\nto the Council about the recent<br />\nassaults on Hopkins students. He<br />\nsuggested implementing better<br />\nlighting on campus and discussed<br />\nalternative solutions to the crime<br />\nproblem plagueing the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nAlso at the meeting<br />\nWednesday night Shep Hoffman,<br />\na junior, proposed that the<br />\nCouncil \"take under its wing\" a<br />\ncomplete evaluation of professors<br />\nwho have taught students who<br />\nare presently sophomores,juniors<br />\nor seniors. The results of this<br />\nevaluation as Hoffman plans,<br />\nwould be made available to the<br />\nAcademic Council who would<br />\nthen attempt to correct problems<br />\nthat teachers were having.

According to<br />\nRosenberg the first step \"is a<br />\npetition drive to get the support<br />\nof over 50% of the student body.<br />\nThis petition calls for the<br />\nestablishment of MaryPIRG and<br />\nrequests the University<br />\nadministration to collect $1.50<br />\nper semester from each student<br />\nat registration.\" He also indicated<br />\nthat the rights of the minority<br />\nwould be protected by allowing \"<br />\na refund for those desiring not to<br />\nparticipate.\"<br />\nThe plan of attack, beginning<br />\non Monday, will include a<br />\nmassive petition drive. The<br />\norganizers feel that a successful<br />\npetition drive (they hope for<br />\nsome 70% of undergrads and<br />\ngraduate students) will serve as a<br />\n<br />\nstudent mandate which can be<br />\npresented to the Board of<br />\nTrustees. Petitioning, as opposed<br />\nto a campus referendum is being<br />\nused as the vehicle for<br />\ndemonstrating student support<br />\nbecause, according to the group,<br />\n'Sit is highly unlikely that<br />\nstudents would vote in sufficient<br />\nnumbers to show an absolute<br />\nmajority of all regularly enrolled<br />\nstudents supporting MaryPIRG.\"<br />\nAt an organizational meeting<br />\nlast night, in Levering Hall, the<br />\nPIRG asked for volunteers to<br />\nman petition booths, compose<br />\nposters, and spread the word of<br />\n<br />\nand are to be situated throughout<br />\nthe metropolitan area.

Worse is the fact that one<br />\nguard assigned to patrol the walkway from the<br />\nathletic center to the dorms every 15 minutes, failed<br />\neven to see that the temporary lights were off for half<br />\nan hour. While it is true that the University has acted<br />\npromptly to upgrade security, combining negligent<br />\npatrolling with a student escort service that may be<br />\nignored amounts to whistling in the dark on the part<br />\nof the University.<br />\nIt will take time to see if a satisfactory security<br />\nsystem can be worked out for this campus without<br />\ncreating the atmosphere of an armed camp. In a matter<br />\nas important as security, no quick and easy solutions<br />\nshould be expected. But at the same time, no<br />\nsatisfactory solution will be found unless everyone<br />\nconcerned cooperates to assure the safety of<br />\nthemselves and of others around them.<br />\n<br />\nvol. lxxvii, no. 11/friday, october 13, 1972<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nDon Lassus, Richard Waring<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\nB.H.

Yet the criticisms persist,<br />\nsome of which are downright perplexing.<br />\nConsider: Ramsey Clark spends at least<br />\nthree hours a day talking about the<br />\ndamage we are doing to North<br />\nVietnamese hospitals, women, children,<br />\nbabies, etc. I wish someone would tell Mr.<br />\nClark that there has never been, in my<br />\nrecollection, an errorless war; that<br />\nmistakes are bound to occur; and when,<br />\nregretably, they do, there can be no<br />\nguilty party.<br />\nI think the benefits of the campaign<br />\nwill prove worth the undesirable incidents<br />\nfaced along the way.

The choice, in<br />\n, most cases, is simple. Of course, the<br />\ninauguration of the current military<br />\npolicy, vis a vis the air attacks, merely<br />\ncorroborates bombing as an effective<br />\nmeans to curtail the North Vietnamese<br />\n' offensive. We should have done this in '65<br />\nunder President Goldwater (which, by the<br />\nway, sounds nice, doesn't it...President<br />\nGoldwater.)<br />\nFeelings run that supplying North<br />\nVietnam with the support needed to<br />\nMaintain her existence is bad, but even<br />\nworse is that, in the process, we are<br />\nsupporting Corrupt Dictator Thieu. A few<br />\npoints:<br />\na) if Thieu is so corrupt, why hasn't he<br />\nbeen overthrown? The Presidential<br />\nPalace is easily accessible, making it<br />\nfairly simple for a large or even small<br />\nuprising to displace the tyrant. And<br />\nsuch action certainly would not be<br />\nuncommon in Asian affairs;<br />\nb) labeling Thieu a dictator exhibits total<br />\nignorance of what consitutes a<br />\ntotalitarian, and also displays an<br />\nultra-adolescent view of international<br />\naffiars; however,<br />\nc) that does not mean that Thieu has not<br />\ntaken on some totalitarian<br />\ncharacteristics, such as jailing<br />\ndissenters, suspending laws, etc.<br />\nDuring World War II, Roosevelt jailed,<br />\nwithout trial, 100,000<br />\nJapanese-Americans... just threw 'em<br />\nin the clink!

But, as its annual film journey<br />\nback into Nostalgia, the Baltimore<br />\nMuseum of Art is currently featuring a<br />\nCapra retrospective, \"Was There Ever<br />\nReally An America, Or Was There Only<br />\n' Frank Capra?\" it is an excellent chance<br />\nto catch a slice of Americana that's no<br />\nlonger with us..<br />\nThe series' title is not as flippant as it<br />\nsounds.

Today's column is by<br />\nMichael Price, a student in the Evening<br />\nCollege.<br />\n<br />\nThe life story of Frank Capra is itself a<br />\nFrank Capra movie. A poor Italian<br />\nimmigrant living in what he called the<br />\n\"sleazy Sicilian ghetto\" of Los Angeles,<br />\nhe realized that the near-by Hollywood<br />\nfilm industry was a \"magic carpet\" out of<br />\npoverty. He got his first job as a movie<br />\nprop man and then became a writer for<br />\nHal Roach's \"Our Gang\" comedies. From<br />\nRoach he moved to the Mack Sennett<br />\nstudios, where he co-wrote and<br />\nco-directed two of the great silent Harry<br />\nLangdon films.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1927 he joined up with Columbia<br />\nPictures, a fly-by-night studio nicknamed .<br />\nby columnists as \"The Germ of the<br />\nOcean.\" After six years of turning out<br />\ngrade-B flicks for them, he made Lady<br />\nFor a Day. It was his\u2014and<br />\nColumbia's\u2014first critical success.<br />\nCapra topped Lady for a Day with his<br />\nnext film\u2014It Happened One Night. The<br />\nmovie made stars of Clark Gable and<br />\nClaudette Colbert and earned Capra his<br />\nfirst Academy Award for Best Director,<br />\nHe also won the award for his next film,<br />\nMr Deeds Goes to Town. After this came<br />\nLost Horizons, You Can't Take it with<br />\nYou, for which he won his tird Best<br />\nDirector Oscar, and, in 1939, Mr. Smith<br />\nGoes to Washington.<br />\nMr. Smith is probably the ultimate<br />\nFrank Capra film. The hero is one<br />\nJefferson Smith, played by James<br />\nStewart, a rural hick appointed to the US<br />\nSenate by corrupt politicians who plan to<br />\nuse him as a puppet. But in the<br />\ntru with great popular and critical success,<br />\nwith one startling exception, the US<br />\nSenate. Senator Alben Barkley claimed<br />\nthat the film was \"a gross distortion.. It<br />\nwas so vicious an idea it was a source of ,<br />\ndisgust and hilarity to every member of<br />\nCongress who saw it.\" Capra called it<br />\n\"the best picture (I) ever made.\"<br />\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Capra enlisted in<br />\nthe Army and made a series of seven<br />\nfifty-minute propaganda films collectively<br />\nentitled Why We Fight. With these films<br />\nCapra proved that hea was not only a<br />\ndirector of comedy but a filmmaker of<br />\ndistinction. The films are superb<br />\ndocumentaries, since equalled only by<br />\nMarcel Ophuls' The Sorrow and the Pity.<br />\n<br />\nThey are landmarks in cinema<br />\nproduction.<br />\nThe war marked a turning point in<br />\nCapra's career. Somewhere in the<br />\ncorridors of Washington, Capra had left<br />\nhis magic touch, his magic carpet. It's a<br />\nWonderfill Life, made in 1946 and<br />\nstarring James Stewart, met only<br />\nlukewarm success, and from then on it<br />\nwas all downhill, ending with A Pocketfid<br />\nof Miracles in 1961, a critical and<br />\nfinancial flop. It was to be his last movie.<br />\nAnd yet the Capra influence is still felt<br />\nin the film industry today. Besides<br />\ncontributing a unique form of comedy<br />\nand a realistic form of documentary, he<br />\npersonally developed the one-man,<br />\none-film method of directing. The<br />\ndirector has absolute control of his film,<br />\nfrom the first scripting and casting to the<br />\nfinal editing. \"One man makes one film;<br />\none painter, one painting,\" says Capra.<br />\n\"It isn't a committee,\"<br />\nThe Museum of Art, in selectin the<br />\nou an t<br />\nS a on er u I. e an<br />\nTake It With You in favor of some of his<br />\nlater clinkers such as A Hole In The Head.<br />\nBut the Museum astutely scheduled these<br />\nduds as the first several films of the series,<br />\nso, beginning Friday, with It Happened<br />\nOne Night, the Museum auditorium will<br />\nbe showing six Capra classics<br />\nThe schedule is as follows, with all of<br />\nthe films beginning at 8pm: October<br />\n13(tonight), It happened one Night,<br />\nOctober 17, Lost Horizon; October 20,<br />\nMr. Deeds Goes to Town; October 24,,<br />\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington; October<br />\n27, Meet John Doe; and October 31,<br />\nDivide and Conquer.

The folks<br />\nat Performance are working hard.<br />\n\"I think that for Baltomore we have an<br />\ninnovative approach to journalism. We've<br />\ntaken our cue from papers like Boston<br />\nAfter Dark, and we want to have in-depth<br />\nnews and in-depth features. Crimes and<br />\nauto wrecks in the harbor tunnel aren't<br />\npart of what we're doing.\"<br />\nThat's William Bray speaking, a man<br />\nwith longish hair and a very drawn, very<br />\ntired looking face. As publisher of<br />\nPerformance, he's probably the busiest<br />\nperson in their Charles Street home. He<br />\nstill manages to be a \"Bill\" rather than a<br />\nstuffy \"William.\"<br />\nSecond busiest? Probably Michael<br />\nWeissman, the associate editor and a<br />\nHopkins senior. The gentlemen echo each<br />\nother when they talk about their product,<br />\nbut it's probably a coincidence and not a<br />\nparty line. There's no hesitation in<br />\nanswering when asked what they think<br />\nabout the project. \"The paper is OK now,<br />\nat leat for me, but it's the future<br />\npossibilities that are more interesting,\"<br />\nsays Weissman. And Bray talks in the<br />\nsame terms: \"I would hate to say, 'I'm<br />\nsatisfied,' period. Satisfied has overtones<br />\nof complacency. I should say we've<br />\nprogressed on schedule.\" What does the<br />\nschedule hold for the future? \"Well, it's<br />\nnot 1973 yet.\" Accept on good faith that<br />\nthey want to develop the enormous<br />\npotential which a genuine Baltimore<br />\nweekly newspaper would have. Ambition<br />\nis not lacking.<br />\nThe first issue of Performance<br />\nappeared June 15, and now there's a solid<br />\n<br />\n20,000 circulation. Their offices are<br />\nreminiscent of those of a well-off charity<br />\norganization. The rooms have a<br />\ntemporary look, as if the furniture is<br />\neither just coming or going.

When they appear, editorials are<br />\ncalled Crabs, but they appear only rarely.<br />\nA newspaper, a \"metropolitan weekly,\"<br />\nseems flabby if it does not have any<br />\nrecognizable editorial policy, a voice of<br />\nits own. There is no connecting muscle to<br />\ntie the articles together, and at times<br />\nPerformance appears only to be a forum<br />\nfor free-lancers. Do the editors<br />\nthemselves have nothing to say? Part of<br />\nthe problem is surely lack of staff or of<br />\ntime, but the problem is serious and<br />\nremains.<br />\nAnother very tangible complaint is<br />\nthat in most issues there's just not much<br />\nto read. The twenty page Performance<br />\npublished at the time of the city fair<br />\ncontained only seven articles, while, for<br />\ncomparison, this Tuesday's eight page<br />\nNews-Letter had seventeen. It's also fair<br />\nto ask how many people actually pick up<br />\nPerformance for its articles. How many<br />\nHoppies read more than the calendar of<br />\nevents? How often do people first learn<br />\nof issues in the paper? Weissman is aware<br />\nthat there is a problem. \"Right now we<br />\nhave mediocre stories and an occassional<br />\ngood one. As soon as I can get some<br />\nreally, really good writers, we'll have only<br />\ngood stories with a few fantastic ones.\"<br />\nProbably just as he should be, Bray is<br />\noptimistic about his venture.

Matera, Executive<br />\nDirector of the Baltimore Legal<br />\nAid Bureau, observed that most<br />\npoor people never attempted to<br />\nseek court proceedings, even in<br />\nthe many cases where they have<br />\nclear grounds for complaint.<br />\n\"The poor don't trust the<br />\nlaw,\" Matera maintained. \"The<br />\nlaw always seems to be taking<br />\nthings away from them,\" he<br />\nadded, \"like a refrigerator for<br />\ninstance.\" The number of<br />\nneighborhood law offices grew<br />\nfrom four to eight in the wake of<br />\nthe 1968 riots, and although this<br />\n<br />\nfurther localization of the Legal<br />\nAid made it more convenient for<br />\nthe poor to seek assistance there<br />\nis still a situation where only a<br />\nsmall percentage of the poor who<br />\nactually need or deserve legal<br />\nhelp actually seek it.<br />\nThe Legal Aid Bureau never<br />\nturns away a poor person who<br />\ncomes to them for help,<br />\naccording to Matera. In recent<br />\nyears the majority of individual<br />\nproblems have involved<br />\nconsultation and advice, while of<br />\nthe cases that actually go to'<br />\ncourt only 10% are lost, on the<br />\naverage, every year.<br />\nStruck Down<br />\nReform of the law and the<br />\nlegal system has become an<br />\nincreasingly important function<br />\nof the Legal Aid Bureau. Two<br />\nyears ago the Bureau resolved in<br />\nits favour the case of Long, et al<br />\nV.

In this<br />\ninstance the Federal Court struck<br />\ndown the law which had alloweu<br />\nsixteen and seventeen year-old<br />\nchildren in Baltimore City to be<br />\ntreated as adults, rather than<br />\njuveniles.<br />\nOther recent decisions<br />\nsuccessfully defended by the<br />\nLegal Aid Bureau have involved<br />\nthe reinstatement of children in<br />\nhigh school who were unjustly<br />\nsuspended, the reform of housing<br />\ncode violations, the reform of<br />\nwelfare law and consumer<br />\nprotection for the poor.<br />\n<br />\nEscort Service<br />\nDr. George S\u2022Benton, Vice-President for<br />\nHomewood Division, announced that effective<br />\ntoday, October 13, 1972, an escort service will<br />\nbe available on the Home wood Campus.

Probably<br />\ntwo of the spectators were<br />\nrecognized quite easily: Dean<br />\nShaffer and former Financial Aid<br />\nDirector David Kauffman. The<br />\nwhite-haired gentleman with the<br />\nglasses, a cane, and a short<br />\nmoustache, was probably not so<br />\neasily recognized by most<br />\nHopkins students. Yet he is a<br />\nman whom lacrosse Coach Bob<br />\nScott has called \"one of the most<br />\noutstanding athletes in Hopkins<br />\nhistory.\" His name? C. Gardner<br />\nMallonee.<br />\nGardner Mallonee (or Gard, or<br />\nMal, or Mr. Mal) played football<br />\nand lacrosse for the University<br />\nduring the years 1924-1928. He<br />\nplayed as an end on the varsity<br />\nfootball team for four years, was<br />\nthe varsity captain as a junior and<br />\n<br />\nsenior, receiving All-Maryland<br />\nhonors those two years, and was<br />\ngiven a major college<br />\nAll-American honorable mention<br />\nby the New York Sun his senior<br />\nyear. He played defense for the<br />\nlacrosse squad for three years,<br />\nmaking second team<br />\nAll-American as a junior, first<br />\nteam All-American as a senior,<br />\nand leading the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUS Olympic lacrosse team to<br />\nAmsterdam in 1928.*<br />\nAfter sraduation, he<br />\nhead-coached the lacrosse team<br />\nwith Kelso Morrill for 12 years.<br />\nIn 1946, after having also served<br />\nas graduate business manager for<br />\nthe athletic department, he<br />\nbecame Director of Athletics. He<br />\nretured from that office 3 years<br />\nlater, but remained active as a<br />\ncollegiate referee until a severe<br />\nstroke in 1960 debilitated him.<br />\nSince then, Mal has acted as a<br />\npromotion man and scout for<br />\nJHU sports. In 1960, he was also<br />\nelected to the Lacrosse<br />\nHall-of-Fame, along with Al<br />\n<br />\nKaline and Jim Lacey.<br />\nSixty-nine years old, as of last<br />\nSunday, Garnder Mallonee lives<br />\nin a modest white frame house in<br />\nnorthwest Baltimore with his<br />\nwife Esther, his son Lucky, and<br />\ntwo dogs and a cat. Its cluttered<br />\nhominess is a refreshing contrast<br />\nfrom the sterile setting of a<br />\ntypical middle-class home. Half<br />\nof the first floor is one room,<br />\nwhich has a dining table, sofa,<br />\nTV, stereo , and several chairs<br />\nand bookshelves spread liberally<br />\nthroughout. Scattered atop the<br />\nfurniture and mantle are old<br />\nsports magazines, greeting cards,<br />\nawards, candles, and other<br />\nbric-a-brac that the Mallonees<br />\nhave collected. It all lends to the<br />\nair of unpretentiousness<br />\ndisplayed by the family.<br />\nWHen one talks with Mal<br />\nabout his college days, a gleam<br />\nappears in his eye and his voice<br />\ntakes on a youthful entusiasm,<br />\ntinged with a little bit of that<br />\ncharming Baltimore accent of his.<br />\nHis fondest and most thrilling<br />\n<br />\nAustin Doyle, athlete-scholar<br />\n<br />\nmemories are of his senior year.<br />\nIn the fall of that year, he<br />\ncaptained the football team to a<br />\nwinning season. The highlight of<br />\nthe season was beating<br />\nMAryland, 14-13, which back<br />\nthen had the importance of an<br />\nArmy-Navy game for the two<br />\nschools.<br />\nLacrosse season, however was<br />\nthe climax of the year, then as it<br />\nis now. Great things were<br />\nexpected from the Jays on the<br />\nbasis of their undefeated season<br />\nfrom the year before, and there<br />\nwas even more excitement<br />\ngenerated by the fact that the<br />\nbest lacrosse team, as decided by<br />\na post-season play-off, would<br />\nrepresent the US in the<br />\nOlympics. Hopkins started off<br />\nwell, but their chances faded near<br />\nthe end of the season when they<br />\nlost to Army and Navy. Their last<br />\nchance came against Maryland,<br />\nwho was undefeated, in the final<br />\ngame of the season. It turned out<br />\nto be a great day for the Jays, as<br />\nthey won, and for Mallonee, who<br />\nshut out the Terps' Hall-of-Fame<br />\nattackman Fred Linkous<br />\nAs the team awaited the<br />\nresults of the Army-Navy game<br />\nand the Olympic Committee's<br />\nselections for play-off spots,<br />\nMallonee left campus the day<br />\nafter exams for his post-graduate<br />\njob in New York with the N.Y.<br />\nCentral Railroad. When the<br />\nselections were made, Hopkins<br />\nwas the last of the six teams<br />\npicked. They were to play the<br />\ntop team in lacrosse, Mt.<br />\nWashington, as part of a<br />\ndoubleheader in Baltimore. With<br />\nhis full-time job to worry about,<br />\nMal thought his chances of<br />\nplaying were nill.<br />\nBut, on the day before the<br />\ngame, he was called into his<br />\nsupervisor's office. Expecting to<br />\nbe reprimanded for doing<br />\nsomething wrong on the job,<br />\nMallonee listened to his boss tell<br />\nhim, \"We've got a telegram from<br />\na coach down in Baltimore. Says<br />\nhe needs you for a soccer game,<br />\nor something like that tomorrow.<br />\nWhich line would you like a free<br />\npass on?\" For Mal it was the<br />\nmost thrilling moment of his life,<br />\nand today he will smile warmly<br />\n<br />\nBy GERRY GREENFIELD<br />\nA person looking at Austin<br />\nDoyle would probably not be<br />\nimpressed with his'-appearance<br />\nany more than he would be with<br />\nthat of any other Hopkins<br />\nstudent. To see him striding<br />\nbriskly from all Biology classes in<br />\nMerganthaler with a stack of<br />\nbooks almost too large for his<br />\narms one would consider him, as<br />\nhe himself does, \"just another<br />\npre-med throat.\" What one\u2014ri-iight<br />\nfail to notice is that this throat is<br />\nat the athletic center six days a<br />\nweek for cross country practices<br />\nor meets and that he probably<br />\nruns more miles in a month than<br />\nsome people drive.<br />\nMild-mannered<br />\nIn the past two cross country<br />\nmeets Austin has scored in the<br />\ntop five for Hopkins although he<br />\nconsiders himself a less than<br />\nAustin Doyle, running on left<br />\naverage runner.

This electoral race will be<br />\nthe sixth national election<br />\nCummings has worked on for<br />\nNBC.<br />\nIn 1962 an official of NBC<br />\nread Cumming's doctoral thesis<br />\non the prediction of House races<br />\nfrom 1920 to 1960 and hired<br />\nhim to analyze the races for<br />\nthem.<br />\nThere are two rifajOr ways<br />\nelections are predicted,<br />\nCummings explained. The first is<br />\nthe mechanical method; a<br />\ncomputer is fed a mathematical<br />\nmodel containing the results of<br />\npast elections by district and<br />\nguesses made by Cummings and<br />\nhis associates on the results of<br />\nthe upcoming election. As the<br />\n<br />\nactual vote count is fed into the<br />\ncomputer and through the math<br />\nmodel it corrects the educated<br />\nguesses and begins to show the<br />\nswing of the election. In this way<br />\nthe computer can predict the<br />\nrange of available seats in the<br />\nHouse that can go Republican or<br />\nDemocratic and what probably<br />\nwill happen there.<br />\nThe second way involves<br />\nhuman prediction and a figure<br />\ncalled the House Basic Listing<br />\n(HBL). The HBL contains the list<br />\nof states in alphabetical order,<br />\nhow they voted in 1970 by<br />\nDistrict, and what percentage of \u2022<br />\nseats that went Republican and<br />\nDemocratic. The votes from an<br />\nelection are fed into a computer<br />\nalong with the HBL. Every seven<br />\nminutes the computer gives out<br />\nthe current House Basic Listing.<br />\nThis allows Cummings to see<br />\nvoting patterns and their changes,<br />\nupon which .he can then base<br />\n<br />\npredictions.<br />\nWhen Cummings is working on<br />\nthese figures during election<br />\nnight and he sees a strong pattern<br />\nhis job is to write up a short<br />\nparagraph which the anchorman<br />\nwill read over the air. Besides<br />\nbasing predictions on the results<br />\nof the machines individual races<br />\nare called on the phone in order<br />\nto get the immediated raw vote<br />\nand the percentage of votes in by<br />\ndistrict. As soon as a certain lead<br />\nlooks safe it is then called into<br />\nNBC and it goes up on the TV<br />\nboard.<br />\nCummings expects two major<br />\ndifficulties in predicting this<br />\nyear's House elections. The first<br />\none is Nixon's great lead: will it<br />\neffect House races by slanting<br />\nthem Republican? The other<br />\nproblem is whether or not, and<br />\nto what degree, ticket splitting<br />\nwill occur. Cummings predicts<br />\nthat \u2022 Nixon's current poll lead<br />\n<br />\nDr. Milton Cummings<br />\nwill be narrowed and that ticket<br />\nsplitting will occur. He forsees<br />\nthe House remaining in the<br />\ncontrol of the Democrats.<br />\n<br />\nof society supported us only to<br />\nfind out that the PResident ran<br />\naway from his proposal, as he has<br />\nwith every proposal he has made.<br />\nIt is easy to propose, but to me<br />\nthe responsibility of being a<br />\nleader is to carry through and<br />\nfight for the matters you<br />\npropose, and Richard Nixon<br />\nnever fights for anything he says<br />\nhe believes in.\"<br />\nRibicoff then turned to the<br />\npositive side where he at once<br />\noutlined the McGovern domestic<br />\npriorities. He cited full<br />\nemployment as the first<br />\neconomic concern before<br />\nalluding to the economic<br />\nconversion of military materials,<br />\nwhere he gave several examples.<br />\nHe scoffed at those who felt full<br />\nemployment and a peace time<br />\nexonomy incompatible, then<br />\nproceeded to explain.<br />\nMoving along to the issue of<br />\ntaxes, the Connecticut liberal<br />\ndiscussed the McGovern position<br />\non closing loopholes, while<br />\nillustrating that the actual<br />\nmaximum tax rate for individuals<br />\nwould decline from 70% to 48%.<br />\nHe again reiterated the claim that<br />\ntaxes on wages and salaries would<br />\nnot increase one single penny.<br />\n\"THose benefitting from oil<br />\ndepletion allowances or fancy<br />\nschemes to generate farm losses<br />\nare disturbed about George<br />\nMcGovern's tax program.

The<br /><br />\nHogan to lead search for gifted children<br />\nBy SHARON FELDSTEIN<br />\nDr. Robert Hogan,<br />\nPsychOlogy, a specialist in<br />\nPersonality assessment, has taken<br />\nthe job of directing a<br />\nforthcoming project in_which a<br />\nteam of University 'researchers<br />\nwill screen junior high school age<br />\nChildren in a search for<br />\nexceptional verbal and<br />\nhumanistic talent.<br />\nHogan explained his interest in<br />\nthis project stating,<br />\n\"Mathematical and scientific<br />\nability is relatively easy to spot in<br />\na child and our social system<br />\nrewards such ability quite early.<br />\nAs a result, a number of children<br />\nare urged to go into science and<br />\nmathematics whereas they would<br />\nbe much happier doing<br />\nsomething else.\"<br />\nAll Maryland junior high<br />\nschools are given the opportunity<br />\nto participate in the project,<br />\nWhich will extend over a five year<br />\nPeriod. A grant of $189,500<br />\nfrom the Spencer Foundation of<br />\nChicago, a private organization<br />\nthat specializes in funding<br />\nresearch in education, supports<br />\nthe project.<br />\nThe purpose of the project is<br />\nt hreefold. Researchers will try to<br />\ndetermine how many youngsters<br />\nthere are in the population who<br />\nare gifted in the verbal area, what<br />\nother abilities and interests<br />\nCharacterize them, and what kind<br />\nof assistance can be provided to<br />\nencourage the children.<br />\n\"There are some othet<br />\nquestions to which we'll be<br />\nseeking answers,\" Hogan<br />\ne xplained, \"For example, is<br />\nachievement in the humanities<br />\nnecessarily incompatible with<br />\nmathematical attainment? Why<br />\nar e citildren with humanistic<br /><br />\nability so much less visible in the<br />\npopulation than the<br />\nquantitatively gifted?

The challenge<br />\nand stimulation of accelerated<br />\nwork often proves to be<br />\nbeneficial<br />\nSimilar success is hoped for by<br /><br />\nHogan and his team; however,<br />\nthey expressed doubt that there<br />\nwill be as many verbally gifted<br />\nchildrm. Also, since verbal<br />\nability appears to result from<br />\nexperience more than<br />\nmathematical talent does, the<br />\nverbal talent may not be<br />\napparent at so early an age.<br />\nThe researchers are confident<br />\nthat they will locate more than<br />\nenough gifted students to make<br />\nthe project worthwhile.<br /><br />\n3400 Committee<br />\nfair will also feature a wide range<br />\nof musical and theatrical<br />\nentertainment, an antique car<br />\nshow and exhibits of arts and<br />\ncrafts by local artisans Ft the<br />\nGilman quad.<br />\nTile fair is slated to take place<br />\nthe weekend of April 13-15 and<br />\nwas planned to coincide with the<br />\nHopkins-Virginia lacrosse game<br />\non Saturday, April 14.<br /><br />\nSC recognizes two groups<br /><br />\nDr. Hogan<br />\nand human communications<br />\nexpert, and Roger Webb,<br />\nassistant professor of psychology<br />\nand specialist in intellectual<br />\ndevelopment of children.

Recently<br />\nMaryPIRG was granted $50 by<br />\nthe junior class to get started, but<br />\nLee requested an additional $150<br />\nfrom the Council for publicity<br />\nand other \"essentials.\"<br />\nLee reviewed the history of<br />\nPIRG and he discussed the<br />\nconcept of PIRG both nationally<br />\nand here at Hopkins. The<br />\norganization originated at the<br />\nUniversity of Oregon and there<br />\nare presently chapters in twelve<br />\nstates. MaryPIRG is being<br />\nconsidered at colleges throughout<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nIn order for a college chapter<br />\nto be established 51 percent of<br />\nthe student body of that college,<br /><br />\nor university must agree to tax<br />\nthemselves in the amount of $3<br />\nper person, according to Lee. He<br />\nstated that these funds will be<br />\nused to hire full-time<br />\nprofessionals, whose purpose will<br />\nbe to represent the paying<br />\nstudents in their public interest<br />\nproblems. Lee indicated that he<br />\nhoped for 10 to 12 full time<br />\nworkers in the state of Maryland.<br />\nIn addition to requesting<br />\n$150, Lee asked for a general<br />\nresolution saying that the<br />\nStudent Council recognizes<br />\nMaryPIRG and encourages<br />\nparticipation in the public<br />\nresearch group. The financial<br />\naward was approved by a large<br />\nmajority and the appropriation<br />\nitself served as a resolution that<br />\nthe Council recognizes the group<br />\non campus.<br />\nRebecca Love, administrative<br />\nofficer of the Hopkins Women'<br />\nCenter, presented the group's<br />\nconstitution requested that the<br />\ngroup be officially recognized<br />\nand be eligible to obtain<br />\nUniversity funds. The women's<br />\ngroup was unanimously<br /><br />\nrecognized by the Council, but<br />\nfunds will be dealt out by the<br />\nStudent Activities Committee.<br />\nDean Robert Fitzpatrick spoke<br />\nto the Council about the recent<br />\nassaults on Hopkins students. He<br />\nsuggested implementing better<br />\nlighting on campus and discussed<br />\nalternative solutions to the crime<br />\nproblem plagueing the<br />\nHomewood campus.<br />\nAlso at the meeting<br />\nWednesday night Shep Hoffman,<br />\na junior, proposed that the<br />\nCouncil \"take under its wing\" a<br />\ncomplete evaluation of professors<br />\nwho have taught students who<br />\nare presently sophomores,juniors<br />\nor seniors. The results of this<br />\nevaluation as Hoffman plans,<br />\nwould be made available to the<br />\nAcademic Council who would<br />\nthen attempt to correct problems<br />\nthat teachers were having.

According to<br />\nRosenberg the first step \"is a<br />\npetition drive to get the support<br />\nof over 50% of the student body.<br />\nThis petition calls for the<br />\nestablishment of MaryPIRG and<br />\nrequests the University<br />\nadministration to collect $1.50<br />\nper semester from each student<br />\nat registration.\" He also indicated<br />\nthat the rights of the minority<br />\nwould be protected by allowing \"<br />\na refund for those desiring not to<br />\nparticipate.\"<br />\nThe plan of attack, beginning<br />\non Monday, will include a<br />\nmassive petition drive. The<br />\norganizers feel that a successful<br />\npetition drive (they hope for<br />\nsome 70% of undergrads and<br />\ngraduate students) will serve as a<br /><br />\nstudent mandate which can be<br />\npresented to the Board of<br />\nTrustees. Petitioning, as opposed<br />\nto a campus referendum is being<br />\nused as the vehicle for<br />\ndemonstrating student support<br />\nbecause, according to the group,<br />\n'Sit is highly unlikely that<br />\nstudents would vote in sufficient<br />\nnumbers to show an absolute<br />\nmajority of all regularly enrolled<br />\nstudents supporting MaryPIRG.\"<br />\nAt an organizational meeting<br />\nlast night, in Levering Hall, the<br />\nPIRG asked for volunteers to<br />\nman petition booths, compose<br />\nposters, and spread the word of<br /><br />\nand are to be situated throughout<br />\nthe metropolitan area.

Worse is the fact that one<br />\nguard assigned to patrol the walkway from the<br />\nathletic center to the dorms every 15 minutes, failed<br />\neven to see that the temporary lights were off for half<br />\nan hour. While it is true that the University has acted<br />\npromptly to upgrade security, combining negligent<br />\npatrolling with a student escort service that may be<br />\nignored amounts to whistling in the dark on the part<br />\nof the University.<br />\nIt will take time to see if a satisfactory security<br />\nsystem can be worked out for this campus without<br />\ncreating the atmosphere of an armed camp. In a matter<br />\nas important as security, no quick and easy solutions<br />\nshould be expected. But at the same time, no<br />\nsatisfactory solution will be found unless everyone<br />\nconcerned cooperates to assure the safety of<br />\nthemselves and of others around them.<br /><br />\nvol. lxxvii, no. 11/friday, october 13, 1972<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nDon Lassus, Richard Waring<br />\nbusiness managers<br />\nB.H.

The choice, in<br />\n, most cases, is simple. Of course, the<br />\ninauguration of the current military<br />\npolicy, vis a vis the air attacks, merely<br />\ncorroborates bombing as an effective<br />\nmeans to curtail the North Vietnamese<br />\n' offensive. We should have done this in '65<br />\nunder President Goldwater (which, by the<br />\nway, sounds nice, doesn't it...President<br />\nGoldwater.)<br />\nFeelings run that supplying North<br />\nVietnam with the support needed to<br />\nMaintain her existence is bad, but even<br />\nworse is that, in the process, we are<br />\nsupporting Corrupt Dictator Thieu.

But, as its annual film journey<br />\nback into Nostalgia, the Baltimore<br />\nMuseum of Art is currently featuring a<br />\nCapra retrospective, \"Was There Ever<br />\nReally An America, Or Was There Only<br />\n' Frank Capra?\" it is an excellent chance<br />\nto catch a slice of Americana that's no<br />\nlonger with us..<br />\nThe series' title is not as flippant as it<br />\nsounds.

Today's column is by<br />\nMichael Price, a student in the Evening<br />\nCollege.<br /><br />\nThe life story of Frank Capra is itself a<br />\nFrank Capra movie. A poor Italian<br />\nimmigrant living in what he called the<br />\n\"sleazy Sicilian ghetto\" of Los Angeles,<br />\nhe realized that the near-by Hollywood<br />\nfilm industry was a \"magic carpet\" out of<br />\npoverty. He got his first job as a movie<br />\nprop man and then became a writer for<br />\nHal Roach's \"Our Gang\" comedies. From<br />\nRoach he moved to the Mack Sennett<br />\nstudios, where he co-wrote and<br />\nco-directed two of the great silent Harry<br />\nLangdon films.<br /><br />\nIn 1927 he joined up with Columbia<br />\nPictures, a fly-by-night studio nicknamed .<br />\nby columnists as \"The Germ of the<br />\nOcean.\" After six years of turning out<br />\ngrade-B flicks for them, he made Lady<br />\nFor a Day. It was his\u2014and<br />\nColumbia's\u2014first critical success.<br />\nCapra topped Lady for a Day with his<br />\nnext film\u2014It Happened One Night. The<br />\nmovie made stars of Clark Gable and<br />\nClaudette Colbert and earned Capra his<br />\nfirst Academy Award for Best Director,<br />\nHe also won the award for his next film,<br />\nMr Deeds Goes to Town. After this came<br />\nLost Horizons, You Can't Take it with<br />\nYou, for which he won his tird Best<br />\nDirector Oscar, and, in 1939, Mr. Smith<br />\nGoes to Washington.<br />\nMr. Smith is probably the ultimate<br />\nFrank Capra film. The hero is one<br />\nJefferson Smith, played by James<br />\nStewart, a rural hick appointed to the US<br />\nSenate by corrupt politicians who plan to<br />\nuse him as a puppet. But in the<br />\ntru with great popular and critical success,<br />\nwith one startling exception, the US<br />\nSenate. Senator Alben Barkley claimed<br />\nthat the film was \"a gross distortion.. It<br />\nwas so vicious an idea it was a source of ,<br />\ndisgust and hilarity to every member of<br />\nCongress who saw it.\" Capra called it<br />\n\"the best picture (I) ever made.\"<br />\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Capra enlisted in<br />\nthe Army and made a series of seven<br />\nfifty-minute propaganda films collectively<br />\nentitled Why We Fight. With these films<br />\nCapra proved that hea was not only a<br />\ndirector of comedy but a filmmaker of<br />\ndistinction. The films are superb<br />\ndocumentaries, since equalled only by<br />\nMarcel Ophuls' The Sorrow and the Pity.<br /><br />\nThey are landmarks in cinema<br />\nproduction.<br />\nThe war marked a turning point in<br />\nCapra's career. Somewhere in the<br />\ncorridors of Washington, Capra had left<br />\nhis magic touch, his magic carpet. It's a<br />\nWonderfill Life, made in 1946 and<br />\nstarring James Stewart, met only<br />\nlukewarm success, and from then on it<br />\nwas all downhill, ending with A Pocketfid<br />\nof Miracles in 1961, a critical and<br />\nfinancial flop. It was to be his last movie.<br />\nAnd yet the Capra influence is still felt<br />\nin the film industry today. Besides<br />\ncontributing a unique form of comedy<br />\nand a realistic form of documentary, he<br />\npersonally developed the one-man,<br />\none-film method of directing. The<br />\ndirector has absolute control of his film,<br />\nfrom the first scripting and casting to the<br />\nfinal editing. \"One man makes one film;<br />\none painter, one painting,\" says Capra.<br />\n\"It isn't a committee,\"<br />\nThe Museum of Art, in selectin the<br />\nou an t<br />\nS a on er u I. e an<br />\nTake It With You in favor of some of his<br />\nlater clinkers such as A Hole In The Head.<br />\nBut the Museum astutely scheduled these<br />\nduds as the first several films of the series,<br />\nso, beginning Friday, with It Happened<br />\nOne Night, the Museum auditorium will<br />\nbe showing six Capra classics<br />\nThe schedule is as follows, with all of<br />\nthe films beginning at 8pm: October<br />\n13(tonight), It happened one Night,<br />\nOctober 17, Lost Horizon; October 20,<br />\nMr. Deeds Goes to Town; October 24,,<br />\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington; October<br />\n27, Meet John Doe; and October 31,<br />\nDivide and Conquer.

When they appear, editorials are<br />\ncalled Crabs, but they appear only rarely.<br />\nA newspaper, a \"metropolitan weekly,\"<br />\nseems flabby if it does not have any<br />\nrecognizable editorial policy, a voice of<br />\nits own. There is no connecting muscle to<br />\ntie the articles together, and at times<br />\nPerformance appears only to be a forum<br />\nfor free-lancers. Do the editors<br />\nthemselves have nothing to say? Part of<br />\nthe problem is surely lack of staff or of<br />\ntime, but the problem is serious and<br />\nremains.<br />\nAnother very tangible complaint is<br />\nthat in most issues there's just not much<br />\nto read. The twenty page Performance<br />\npublished at the time of the city fair<br />\ncontained only seven articles, while, for<br />\ncomparison, this Tuesday's eight page<br />\nNews-Letter had seventeen. It's also fair<br />\nto ask how many people actually pick up<br />\nPerformance for its articles. How many<br />\nHoppies read more than the calendar of<br />\nevents? How often do people first learn<br />\nof issues in the paper? Weissman is aware<br />\nthat there is a problem. \"Right now we<br />\nhave mediocre stories and an occassional<br />\ngood one.

Matera, Executive<br />\nDirector of the Baltimore Legal<br />\nAid Bureau, observed that most<br />\npoor people never attempted to<br />\nseek court proceedings, even in<br />\nthe many cases where they have<br />\nclear grounds for complaint.<br />\n\"The poor don't trust the<br />\nlaw,\" Matera maintained. \"The<br />\nlaw always seems to be taking<br />\nthings away from them,\" he<br />\nadded, \"like a refrigerator for<br />\ninstance.\" The number of<br />\nneighborhood law offices grew<br />\nfrom four to eight in the wake of<br />\nthe 1968 riots, and although this<br /><br />\nfurther localization of the Legal<br />\nAid made it more convenient for<br />\nthe poor to seek assistance there<br />\nis still a situation where only a<br />\nsmall percentage of the poor who<br />\nactually need or deserve legal<br />\nhelp actually seek it.<br />\nThe Legal Aid Bureau never<br />\nturns away a poor person who<br />\ncomes to them for help,<br />\naccording to Matera. In recent<br />\nyears the majority of individual<br />\nproblems have involved<br />\nconsultation and advice, while of<br />\nthe cases that actually go to'<br />\ncourt only 10% are lost, on the<br />\naverage, every year.<br />\nStruck Down<br />\nReform of the law and the<br />\nlegal system has become an<br />\nincreasingly important function<br />\nof the Legal Aid Bureau. Two<br />\nyears ago the Bureau resolved in<br />\nits favour the case of Long, et al<br />\nV.

In this<br />\ninstance the Federal Court struck<br />\ndown the law which had alloweu<br />\nsixteen and seventeen year-old<br />\nchildren in Baltimore City to be<br />\ntreated as adults, rather than<br />\njuveniles.<br />\nOther recent decisions<br />\nsuccessfully defended by the<br />\nLegal Aid Bureau have involved<br />\nthe reinstatement of children in<br />\nhigh school who were unjustly<br />\nsuspended, the reform of housing<br />\ncode violations, the reform of<br />\nwelfare law and consumer<br />\nprotection for the poor.<br /><br />\nEscort Service<br />\nDr. George S\u2022Benton, Vice-President for<br />\nHomewood Division, announced that effective<br />\ntoday, October 13, 1972, an escort service will<br />\nbe available on the Home wood Campus.

Probably<br />\ntwo of the spectators were<br />\nrecognized quite easily: Dean<br />\nShaffer and former Financial Aid<br />\nDirector David Kauffman. The<br />\nwhite-haired gentleman with the<br />\nglasses, a cane, and a short<br />\nmoustache, was probably not so<br />\neasily recognized by most<br />\nHopkins students. Yet he is a<br />\nman whom lacrosse Coach Bob<br />\nScott has called \"one of the most<br />\noutstanding athletes in Hopkins<br />\nhistory.\" His name? C. Gardner<br />\nMallonee.<br />\nGardner Mallonee (or Gard, or<br />\nMal, or Mr. Mal) played football<br />\nand lacrosse for the University<br />\nduring the years 1924-1928. He<br />\nplayed as an end on the varsity<br />\nfootball team for four years, was<br />\nthe varsity captain as a junior and<br /><br />\nsenior, receiving All-Maryland<br />\nhonors those two years, and was<br />\ngiven a major college<br />\nAll-American honorable mention<br />\nby the New York Sun his senior<br />\nyear. He played defense for the<br />\nlacrosse squad for three years,<br />\nmaking second team<br />\nAll-American as a junior, first<br />\nteam All-American as a senior,<br />\nand leading the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUS Olympic lacrosse team to<br />\nAmsterdam in 1928.*<br />\nAfter sraduation, he<br />\nhead-coached the lacrosse team<br />\nwith Kelso Morrill for 12 years.<br />\nIn 1946, after having also served<br />\nas graduate business manager for<br />\nthe athletic department, he<br />\nbecame Director of Athletics. He<br />\nretured from that office 3 years<br />\nlater, but remained active as a<br />\ncollegiate referee until a severe<br />\nstroke in 1960 debilitated him.<br />\nSince then, Mal has acted as a<br />\npromotion man and scout for<br />\nJHU sports. In 1960, he was also<br />\nelected to the Lacrosse<br />\nHall-of-Fame, along with Al<br /><br />\nKaline and Jim Lacey.<br />\nSixty-nine years old, as of last<br />\nSunday, Garnder Mallonee lives<br />\nin a modest white frame house in<br />\nnorthwest Baltimore with his<br />\nwife Esther, his son Lucky, and<br />\ntwo dogs and a cat. Its cluttered<br />\nhominess is a refreshing contrast<br />\nfrom the sterile setting of a<br />\ntypical middle-class home. Half<br />\nof the first floor is one room,<br />\nwhich has a dining table, sofa,<br />\nTV, stereo , and several chairs<br />\nand bookshelves spread liberally<br />\nthroughout. Scattered atop the<br />\nfurniture and mantle are old<br />\nsports magazines, greeting cards,<br />\nawards, candles, and other<br />\nbric-a-brac that the Mallonees<br />\nhave collected. It all lends to the<br />\nair of unpretentiousness<br />\ndisplayed by the family.<br />\nWHen one talks with Mal<br />\nabout his college days, a gleam<br />\nappears in his eye and his voice<br />\ntakes on a youthful entusiasm,<br />\ntinged with a little bit of that<br />\ncharming Baltimore accent of his.<br />\nHis fondest and most thrilling<br /><br />\nAustin Doyle, athlete-scholar<br /><br />\nmemories are of his senior year.<br />\nIn the fall of that year, he<br />\ncaptained the football team to a<br />\nwinning season. The highlight of<br />\nthe season was beating<br />\nMAryland, 14-13, which back<br />\nthen had the importance of an<br />\nArmy-Navy game for the two<br />\nschools.<br />\nLacrosse season, however was<br />\nthe climax of the year, then as it<br />\nis now. Great things were<br />\nexpected from the Jays on the<br />\nbasis of their undefeated season<br />\nfrom the year before, and there<br />\nwas even more excitement<br />\ngenerated by the fact that the<br />\nbest lacrosse team, as decided by<br />\na post-season play-off, would<br />\nrepresent the US in the<br />\nOlympics. Hopkins started off<br />\nwell, but their chances faded near<br />\nthe end of the season when they<br />\nlost to Army and Navy. Their last<br />\nchance came against Maryland,<br />\nwho was undefeated, in the final<br />\ngame of the season. It turned out<br />\nto be a great day for the Jays, as<br />\nthey won, and for Mallonee, who<br />\nshut out the Terps' Hall-of-Fame<br />\nattackman Fred Linkous<br />\nAs the team awaited the<br />\nresults of the Army-Navy game<br />\nand the Olympic Committee's<br />\nselections for play-off spots,<br />\nMallonee left campus the day<br />\nafter exams for his post-graduate<br />\njob in New York with the N.Y.<br />\nCentral Railroad. When the<br />\nselections were made, Hopkins<br />\nwas the last of the six teams<br />\npicked. They were to play the<br />\ntop team in lacrosse, Mt.<br />\nWashington, as part of a<br />\ndoubleheader in Baltimore. With<br />\nhis full-time job to worry about,<br />\nMal thought his chances of<br />\nplaying were nill.<br />\nBut, on the day before the<br />\ngame, he was called into his<br />\nsupervisor's office. Expecting to<br />\nbe reprimanded for doing<br />\nsomething wrong on the job,<br />\nMallonee listened to his boss tell<br />\nhim, \"We've got a telegram from<br />\na coach down in Baltimore. Says<br />\nhe needs you for a soccer game,<br />\nor something like that tomorrow.<br />\nWhich line would you like a free<br />\npass on?\" For Mal it was the<br />\nmost thrilling moment of his life,<br />\nand today he will smile warmly<br /><br />\nBy GERRY GREENFIELD<br />\nA person looking at Austin<br />\nDoyle would probably not be<br />\nimpressed with his'-appearance<br />\nany more than he would be with<br />\nthat of any other Hopkins<br />\nstudent. To see him striding<br />\nbriskly from all Biology classes in<br />\nMerganthaler with a stack of<br />\nbooks almost too large for his<br />\narms one would consider him, as<br />\nhe himself does, \"just another<br />\npre-med throat.\" What one\u2014ri-iight<br />\nfail to notice is that this throat is<br />\nat the athletic center six days a<br />\nweek for cross country practices<br />\nor meets and that he probably<br />\nruns more miles in a month than<br />\nsome people drive.<br />\nMild-mannered<br />\nIn the past two cross country<br />\nmeets Austin has scored in the<br />\ntop five for Hopkins although he<br />\nconsiders himself a less than<br />\nAustin Doyle, running on left<br />\naverage runner.

This electoral race will be<br />\nthe sixth national election<br />\nCummings has worked on for<br />\nNBC.<br />\nIn 1962 an official of NBC<br />\nread Cumming's doctoral thesis<br />\non the prediction of House races<br />\nfrom 1920 to 1960 and hired<br />\nhim to analyze the races for<br />\nthem.<br />\nThere are two rifajOr ways<br />\nelections are predicted,<br />\nCummings explained. The first is<br />\nthe mechanical method; a<br />\ncomputer is fed a mathematical<br />\nmodel containing the results of<br />\npast elections by district and<br />\nguesses made by Cummings and<br />\nhis associates on the results of<br />\nthe upcoming election. As the<br /><br />\nactual vote count is fed into the<br />\ncomputer and through the math<br />\nmodel it corrects the educated<br />\nguesses and begins to show the<br />\nswing of the election. In this way<br />\nthe computer can predict the<br />\nrange of available seats in the<br />\nHouse that can go Republican or<br />\nDemocratic and what probably<br />\nwill happen there.<br />\nThe second way involves<br />\nhuman prediction and a figure<br />\ncalled the House Basic Listing<br />\n(HBL). The HBL contains the list<br />\nof states in alphabetical order,<br />\nhow they voted in 1970 by<br />\nDistrict, and what percentage of \u2022<br />\nseats that went Republican and<br />\nDemocratic. The votes from an<br />\nelection are fed into a computer<br />\nalong with the HBL. Every seven<br />\nminutes the computer gives out<br />\nthe current House Basic Listing.<br />\nThis allows Cummings to see<br />\nvoting patterns and their changes,<br />\nupon which .he can then base<br /><br />\npredictions.<br />\nWhen Cummings is working on<br />\nthese figures during election<br />\nnight and he sees a strong pattern<br />\nhis job is to write up a short<br />\nparagraph which the anchorman<br />\nwill read over the air. Besides<br />\nbasing predictions on the results<br />\nof the machines individual races<br />\nare called on the phone in order<br />\nto get the immediated raw vote<br />\nand the percentage of votes in by<br />\ndistrict. As soon as a certain lead<br />\nlooks safe it is then called into<br />\nNBC and it goes up on the TV<br />\nboard.<br />\nCummings expects two major<br />\ndifficulties in predicting this<br />\nyear's House elections. The first<br />\none is Nixon's great lead: will it<br />\neffect House races by slanting<br />\nthem Republican? The other<br />\nproblem is whether or not, and<br />\nto what degree, ticket splitting<br />\nwill occur. Cummings predicts<br />\nthat \u2022 Nixon's current poll lead<br /><br />\nDr. Milton Cummings<br />\nwill be narrowed and that ticket<br />\nsplitting will occur. He forsees<br />\nthe House remaining in the<br />\ncontrol of the Democrats.<br /><br />\nof society supported us only to<br />\nfind out that the PResident ran<br />\naway from his proposal, as he has<br />\nwith every proposal he has made.<br />\nIt is easy to propose, but to me<br />\nthe responsibility of being a<br />\nleader is to carry through and<br />\nfight for the matters you<br />\npropose, and Richard Nixon<br />\nnever fights for anything he says<br />\nhe believes in.\"<br />\nRibicoff then turned to the<br />\npositive side where he at once<br />\noutlined the McGovern domestic<br />\npriorities. He cited full<br />\nemployment as the first<br />\neconomic concern before<br />\nalluding to the economic<br />\nconversion of military materials,<br />\nwhere he gave several examples.<br />\nHe scoffed at those who felt full<br />\nemployment and a peace time<br />\nexonomy incompatible, then<br />\nproceeded to explain.<br />\nMoving along to the issue of<br />\ntaxes, the Connecticut liberal<br />\ndiscussed the McGovern position<br />\non closing loopholes, while<br />\nillustrating that the actual<br />\nmaximum tax rate for individuals<br />\nwould decline from 70% to 48%.<br />\nHe again reiterated the claim that<br />\ntaxes on wages and salaries would<br />\nnot increase one single penny.<br />\n\"THose benefitting from oil<br />\ndepletion allowances or fancy<br />\nschemes to generate farm losses<br />\nare disturbed about George<br />\nMcGovern's tax program.
