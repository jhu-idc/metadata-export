He indicated that the committee's approach has been both statistical<br />\nand anecdotal, with data coming,<br />\nfrom the registrar's office, student surveys and interviews, and<br />\ncomments of department chairs.<br />\nHe said that he requested the<br />\nreport be revised because<br />\n\"basically, as [the Howard committee] brought forth preliminary<br />\nreports, I found pathways that<br />\nmight need to be explored a little<br />\nmore\u2014I wanted to focus on the<br />\nproblems that had been caused so<br />\nwe could attack them.<br />\n\"You don't want to start up<br />\nanother committee just to deal<br />\nwith a few unanswered questions,\" he continued, \"so I sent<br />\nthem back.\"<br />\nHe also felt that some of the<br />\nHoward committee's statistics<br />\nhad been pointing in directions<br />\nthat were unexplored, and he had<br />\nbeen concerned with the accuracy<br />\nand validity of some of the newest<br />\nstatistics. He indicated that the<br />\ncurrent revision requires only<br />\nminor changes in the report based on additional data.<br />\n\"I hoped it would have been<br />\nout in January,\" he said, \"but it<br />\nwas a more massive task than we<br />\nanticipated, and in any case it will<br />\ncertainly be done by the end of<br />\nthis semester.''<br />\nAsked if releasing the report<br />\nthis late would help students<br />\nregistering for classes now, Armstrong responded, \"I would<br />\nrather that it be accurate than early. The students talk to each<br />\nother, and you know yourselves<br />\nwhat you want to avoid or take;<br />\n<br />\nthe report won't be as useful for<br />\nstudents as it will be for the administration, which will help<br />\nthem to isolate the problems and<br />\ndeal with them so the students<br />\nwon't have to worry about it.\"<br />\nAccording to Armstrong, next<br />\nyear's enrollment will be the<br />\nsame size as this year's with no<br />\nplanned increase. As to whether<br />\nenrollment would be smaller or<br />\nnot in the future, he said, \"I don't<br />\nknow. It is my feeling that we<br />\ndon't want to get any larger: the<br />\nquestion is, is this a sustainable<br />\nsize? The objective is clearly to<br />\ncontinue to provide a quality<br />\neducation.\"<br />\nTwo-track Calculus courses<br />\nHe concluded that there would<br />\nbe no easy solutions, although he<br />\ndid agree that the \"two-track\"<br />\nsystem of the Department of<br />\nMathematics to reduce the size of<br />\nlecture classes was a good beginning point.<br />\nThe Mathematics Department<br />\nhas, at Dean Armstrong's insistence, split its calculus courses<br />\ninto calculus for premedical<br />\nstudents and calculus for physical<br />\nscience majors. Starting next<br />\nyear, the introductory physics<br />\ncourse will be split up the same<br />\nway.<br />\nArmstrong said that other solutions will have to be applied<br />\nelsewhere, citing the need \"not<br />\nonly to get beginning and intro<br />\nclasses down to about 40 or so,<br />\nbut upper division classes down<br />\nto 15\u2014there's nothing a priori<br />\nwrong with large lectures, but a<br />\nstudent shouldn't have four years<br />\nof them\u2014there has to be the opportunity for small, intimate<br />\nclasses.\"<br />\nHe indicated that a variety of<br />\napproaches would be tried, with<br />\nthe goal in mind of increasing the<br />\ninteraction between students and<br />\nfaculty members, a feat difficult<br />\nto achieve in a classes of\"300 or<br />\nso\" students.<br />\nGiangiulio noted that eittmy of<br />\nthe problems discussed by the<br />\ncommittee did not arise from the<br />\nFive-Year Plan but began during<br />\nthe '70s.<br />\nAccording to Giangiulio, many of<br />\nthe problems stemmed from lack<br />\nof coordination and communica-<br />\n<br />\ntion between the various<br />\ndepartments.<br />\n\"When Hopkins started admitting more social science and<br />\nhumanities majors,\" he explained, \"the departmcnts weren't told<br />\nto prepare for the influx, so there<br />\nwere huge growths in the social<br />\nscience students and a decrease in<br />\nfaculty; whereas, natural science<br />\nenrollments have decreased<br />\npercentage-wise while their<br />\nfaculty has gone up.\"<br />\nThere are now more students in<br />\nupper-level courses and more<br />\nfreshmen in 100-level courses<br />\nthan ever before, he said.<br />\n\"You now have some upper levei<br />\ncourses that are supposed to be<br />\ntaught like a seminar, but if it's<br />\nseminar style with eighty people,<br />\nthen it's really a lecture.\"<br />\n600-level enrollment down<br />\nGiangiulio also decried the increasing separation of the<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate programs at Hopkins.<br />\nThe number of undergraduates<br />\nenrolled in 600-level courses fell<br />\ndrastically between the fall of<br />\n1980 and this year. Giangiulio attributed this decline to the fact<br />\nthat faculty members are<br />\ndiscouraging undergraduates<br />\nfrom taking graduate level<br />\ncourses.<br />\n\"A lot of people have been<br />\nstifled,\" he added. \"Senior<br />\ntheses have almost become optional unless you want Honors<br />\nfrom your department. Independent study has had a stunning<br />\ndecline, and 600-level enrollment<br />\nhas gone way down.<br />\n\"The committee just wants to let<br />\nthe deans and new president<br />\nknow the situation; department<br />\nchairs were never told to prepare<br />\nnew programs, so now we have<br />\nto compensate.

In contrast,<br />\nmany classes at Columbia, for example, are taught either by<br />\nvisiting professors, non-tenure<br />\ntrack faculty, or graduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\n\"It's become impossible,\" said<br />\nProfessor of History Ronald<br />\nWalters, \"for us [the History<br />\nfaculty] to teach the kinds of<br />\ncourses that we most want to<br />\nteach and which are most<br />\nbeneficial to students\u2014the small<br />\n<br />\nrintilag7\"<br />\nClass sizes in the History<br />\ndepartment, like many others in<br />\nthe Arts and Sciences, are already<br />\nbeing pushed to the limit by the<br />\nincrease in the number of<br />\nstudents. These pressures have<br />\nbeen amplified by a slew of faculty retirements. Although the<br />\nretirements will allow the University to invigorate its faculty in the<br />\nlong run, the current shortage<br />\ncomes at a sensitive time for<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nWalters suggested that University support in the form of<br />\nresearch assistants and secretarial<br />\nhelp for faculty research efforts<br />\nhas not been forthcoming; in-<br />\n<br />\nstead, faculty members have been<br />\nkept busy with time consuming<br />\nmanagerial chores which, at other<br />\nuniversities, is often done for<br />\nthem.<br />\n\"If you look at schools of comparable quality to Hopkins, a very<br />\nhigh proportion of their classes<br />\nare not taught by permanent<br />\nfaculty,\" said Walters. At<br />\nHopkins, in contrast, \"a very<br />\nsmall faculty does a great deal of<br />\nteaching,\" while the University<br />\n\"supports faculty research at a<br />\nvery low level\u2014we don't have<br />\nthe research funds that other<br />\nuniversities have.\" Such shortfalls, suggested Walters, reflect<br />\nmany \"hidden impacts of the<br />\nbudget crisis.\"<br />\nJean McGarry, an Associate<br />\nProfessor in the Writing<br />\nSeminars, noted that \"we [the<br />\nfaculty] bend over backwards\u2014<br />\nand sideways\u2014to get students into classes. That's why many of us<br />\nhave increased class sizes. I can<br />\nsee that the rest of the University<br />\nis pretty overwhelmed.\"<br />\nA source in the Registrar's Office, who wished to remain<br />\nunidentified, agreed that University departments were stretching!<br />\nto accomodate the growing<br />\nnumber of undergraduates. How'<br />\ndo many departments accomplish<br />\nthis? \"They add sections. The<br />\nWriting Seminars have added<br />\nfour or five CAL 'Contemporary<br />\nAmerican Letters] sections.\"<br />\nBlossoming numbers of sections have been particularly evident in departments like<br />\nEconomics, Biology, and<br />\nChemistry, which have very large<br />\nsurvey classes.<br />\nMcGarry said that the Writing<br />\nSeminars employs many parttime faculty members and<br />\ngraduate students to teach, \"so<br />\nwe haven't gotten to the point<br />\n<br />\nwhere we have forty people per<br />\nclass\u2014which is impossible.\" She<br />\nreflected on her experiences as an<br />\nundergraduate at Harvard and<br />\nnoted that \"if someone is giving<br />\na lecture, class size doesn't really matter\u2014but it's not really a<br />\ndiscussion.\"<br />\nMany upper level classes, particularly those which require<br />\nlower level coursework as a<br />\nprerequisite for admission, have<br />\nnot yet felt the pressure from the<br />\nrecently enlarged student body.<br />\nProfessor of Economics Louis<br />\nMaccini observed that \"my current class, Macro-Economic<br />\nTheory, is if anything slightly<br />\nsmaller than last year. It [increased undergraduate enrollment] has<br />\nnot yet materially affected that<br />\nclass.\"<br />\nIn the long run, however, as<br />\nthe class of 1994 and its successors move through the University, it seems pressure can only<br />\nbuild on already strained departments.

Harry Pouder Memorial Lecture Series. University President<br />\nSteven Muller, while introducing<br />\nBradbury, remarked that \"few<br />\nauthors come with such instant<br />\nrecognition\" as the 70-year old<br />\nauthor did Tuesday night. President Muller attributed much of<br />\nBradbury's recognition to the<br />\nwriter's \"vivid style\" which is<br />\nobvious in the 25 books and 400<br />\nshort stories\u2014The Martian<br />\nChronicles, Farhenheit 451, The<br />\nIllustrated Man, Dandelion Wine,<br />\nto name a few titles\u2014that he<br />\npenned in his 58 years of writing.<br />\n\"Ray<br />\nBradbury<br />\nis a<br />\nphenomenon of nature,\" Muller<br />\nsaid. \"Bradbury's imagination is<br />\ndark and bright, brooding, and<br />\nunfettered. He is the master of<br />\nsuspense, science fiction, horror<br />\n. . . But Mr. Bradbury prefers the<br />\nterm 'magical realist.\"<br />\nFrom the outset, Bradbury captivated the audience that packed<br />\nShriver Hall with light-hearted<br />\nanecdotes of his life. Through his<br />\nstories Bradbury conveyed the<br />\nmessage that one should pursue<br />\none's dreams at any cost despite<br />\nwhat others may think.<br />\n\"I love Buck Rogers,\" Bradbury said. \"If you love something<br />\nmadly enough, you shouldn't<br />\ngive it up. I loved Buck Rogers<br />\nso much that I collected Buck<br />\nRogers comic strips all the time<br />\n<br />\nwhen I was nine. People in the<br />\nfifth grade made fun of me, so I<br />\nended up tearing up eight week's<br />\nworth of Buck Rogers . . . And<br />\nthen I cried. I asked myself why<br />\n. . . Who had died? Why was I<br />\ncrying? . . . Then I realized that<br />\nI had died . . . From that point on<br />\nI decided to hell with what other<br />\npeople think . . . And I still collect everything that I love<br />\nAccording to Bradbury, \"This<br />\nmad love is going to pay off<br />\nsomewhere if you stick to it.\" He<br />\ncited his love for dinosaurs, the<br />\nBible, and Shakespeare as \"midwives of himself,\" just at the Bible and Shakespeare were the<br />\n\"midwives\" of Herman<br />\nMelville's Moby Dick. He attributed his succes to \"staying in<br />\nlove with the things I stayed in<br />\nlove with.\"<br />\nAnother major theme Bradbury<br />\ndiscussed is the idea that people<br />\nknow more than they realize.<br />\n\"We all sponge away existence<br />\neveryday but don't realize it's<br />\nthere without testing it,\" Bradbury said. \"Because we don't experiment, we don't ever know<br />\nhow much we really have. Our<br />\nmind is like a rain barrel in the<br />\nsummertime . . . By the end of<br />\nsummer, the water has collected is from the whole summer.<br />\nAll you have to so is reach down<br />\ninto the barrel deep enough and<br />\nyou'll have summer in your grasp<br />\n<br />\nToward the end of his presentation, Bradbury mentioned his<br />\nviews on education. He staunchly<br />\nbelieves it is \"time we give rejection slips for bad teachers.\"<br />\nHe favors taking education away<br />\nfrom the government and giving<br />\nit to private institutuions.<br />\n\"We need to fire those teachers<br />\nwho can't teach otherwise we'll<br />\nall suffer,\" he said.<br />\nBradbury also forsees a future<br />\nfull of videotapes.<br />\n\"Pretty soon everything will be<br />\ndone on videotapes, so we can<br />\npop them in whenever it's convenient for us,\" he said. \"Take<br />\nwhat it will do for politics . . .<br />\nwe'll be able to hear what those<br />\ncandidates say whenever WE<br />\nwant to hear it, and we can rewind the thing to hear their lies<br />\nover and over and over if we<br />\nwant<br />\nThis love for the future and<br />\npredicting that lies ahead for<br />\nmankind is an integral part of Ray<br />\nBradbury's interests.<br />\n\"People ask me why I write<br />\nscience fiction,\" he said. \"I say<br />\nsimply that there is no other fiction to write. Our whole history<br />\nis science fiction. Science fiction<br />\nbegan in the caves, with the<br />\nheiroglyphic tales of survival . . .<br />\nAll things that happen to us has<br />\nto do with technology in some<br />\nway . . . I write science fiction<br />\nbecause there is nothing else to<br />\nwrite<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nRADIO, from 1<br />\nThe University will also provide the JHSRC with the space<br />\nneeded to operate the station. It<br />\nhas not been decided whether the<br />\nJHSRC will be allowed to use the<br />\nroom in the Lazear house of<br />\nAMR II, from which the radio<br />\nstation had previously been run.<br />\nPresident of the JHSRC Brian<br />\nLiddcoat said, \"It appears we<br />\nwill be able to keep the space, but<br />\nit is by no means definitive.\"<br />\nThe additional costs of setting<br />\nup the station in the AMR<br />\nresidences will be approximately $3,500. The JHSRC is contacting alumni and other outside<br />\nsources to solicit support. Assuming that these costs are met, the<br />\nJHSRC hopes to begin programming by next year's freshman<br />\norientation week although the<br />\nJHSRC engineerrs will not be<br />\navailable during the summer.<br />\nLiddicoat is confident, however<br />\nthat the radio station will be fully operational by the middle of<br />\nthe fall 1990 semester.<br />\nArt Yoon, who will be acting<br />\nas the JHSRC representative over<br />\nthe summer, attributed the success of the radio station to the<br />\nJHSRC members. \"If it were not<br />\nfor the people inside the group,<br />\nthe proposal wouldn't have gotten as far as it has,\" said Yoon.<br />\nYoon suggested that there have<br />\nbeen numerous attempts made in<br />\nthe past to reinstate student radio,<br />\nbut it was not until the carrier current proposal that basic questions<br />\n:were answered and that a definite<br />\n'commitment was made on the<br />\npart of the students. Yoon said,<br />\n\"The administration was receptive once we demonstrated that<br />\nthe students are capable of<br />\nprofessional<br />\nresponsible,<br />\nbehavior.\"<br />\nMira Vayda, vice-president of<br />\nBusiness and Advertising, will be<br />\nconsulting the files from the<br />\nformer student-run station to<br />\ncompile information about potential sponsors. Businesses in the<br />\nCharles Village area, Hopkins<br />\nsports teams, and alumni have<br />\nalready been identified as possible advertising sources.<br />\nThe JHSRC is also considering<br />\nestablishing a policy by which<br />\nDJ's will be required to assist the<br />\nadvertising department. As<br />\nVayda suggested, \"It is<br />\neveryone's responsibility to help<br />\ncover the cost if they want to be<br />\ninvolved.\" Treasurer Andy<br />\nBarnert has suggested other<br />\npublicity ideas, including having<br />\nband concerts and dances on the<br />\nfreshman quad to benefit the<br />\nstation.<br />\nVayda will also be contacting<br />\nrecord companies to have the<br />\nJHSRC placed on their mailing<br />\nlists.

Nine men,<br />\n16 women, and 26 children .vere<br />\n<br />\n66,000 in 1979.

Incidents with the refugees<br />\nincluded \"some shootings,\" according to Dr. iCioa.<br />\nA conference was finally held<br />\nto address the Vietnamese<br />\nrefugee problem. \"An agreement<br />\nwas reached in which more than<br />\n14,000 people a month would be<br />\nresettled, provided that the flow<br />\nof refugees would slow.\"<br />\nHowever, more Vietnamese<br />\nleft. \"A screening process was<br />\ndeveloped in June of 1988, but<br />\nthat still did not cut down on the<br />\ninflow.

Although<br />\nAmnesty International had \"no<br />\nspecific information to suggest<br />\nthat any of these 51 people would<br />\nbe at risk of human rights violations in Vietnam,\" the organization was concerned about the<br />\nscreening regulations and other<br />\nimproprieties.<br />\nBeginning with the fall of<br />\nSaigon in April of 1975, Khoa recounted how tens of thousands of<br />\nVietnamese left for the United<br />\nStates. \"At that point about<br />\n125,000 refugees were living in<br />\nthe West.

In addition,<br />\nthose who were given 'interviews' were not exactly interviewed., it was more of a harsh<br />\ninterrogation. Finally, there was<br />\na complicated system of interpretation, where Vietnamese was<br />\ntranslated into Chinese and then<br />\ntranslated into English for the<br />\nbenefit of the English authorities<br />\nin Hong Kong.\"<br />\nThus, according to him, the<br />\nrefugees found it impossible to<br />\nfind out whether their answers<br />\nwere translated properly. Khoa<br />\nmentioned a case in which a pharmacist was asked his profession<br />\nand replied, \"I sell medicine,\"<br />\nwhich was eventually translated<br />\nto \"I sell drugs.\" Of course, he<br />\nwas denied admission, and never<br />\nknew why,\" Khoa said.<br />\nKhoa warned of another crisis<br />\nif immediate action is not taken<br />\nsoon:<br />\n\"We do not know what will<br />\nhappen.

McColl<br />\nI he punchline is this: one man's<br />\nmeat is his castle, or the Andes<br />\nout of anthills.<br />\nAll right. Now you've got your<br />\nplace to live. Presumably you<br />\nwent looking for it with a friend<br />\nor two, and presumably again you<br />\nplan to live with these people.<br />\nCollegiate apartment shoppers<br />\nfall into three categories:<br />\nfreshmen who have lived with<br />\ntheir roommates for a year and<br />\nwant to live with them again,<br />\nfreshmen who have lived with<br />\ntheir roommates for a year and<br />\ndon't want their roommates to<br />\nlive, and upperclassmen who<br />\nthought that they had found the<br />\nideal roommates after killing their<br />\nfreshman year roommates, but<br />\nfound that even their dearest<br />\nfriends are psychopaths.<br />\nI'll suffice it to say that I got<br />\non less than famously with my<br />\nfreshman year roommate. But I<br />\ngot on really well with four other<br />\nfriends of mine, two of whom<br />\nwere dating each other. We all<br />\ngot a rowhouse near 30th and<br />\nAbell. I had my own room, my<br />\nmale roommate had his own<br />\nroom, my female roommate had<br />\nher own room, and the couple<br />\n(hereafter referred to as the Couple) took the master bedroom in<br />\nthe front of the second floor.<br />\nCouples. Couples is a disease,<br />\nlike the flu or the measles. Unlike<br />\nthe flu or measles, however, there<br />\nis no known cure for the Couples.<br />\nThe victim of Couples finds him<br />\nor herself wanting to spend as<br />\nmuch time with their partner that<br />\nthey will use any ploy to do so.<br />\nOne of the first areas Couples infects, therefore, is the larynx,<br />\nwhere it increases the flow of air<br />\nover the vocal cords, making the<br />\nvictim begin to speak in a whiny<br />\nsing-song tone to their partner, as<br />\nin \"G0000000d-by yeeeee\u201e<br />\nh000mxtrinnnneeeeeyyyy, lir 1111<br />\nseeee youuuuu laaaterrrrrrrr.\"<br />\nTypically, the victim can no<br />\nlonger pronounce l's or r's and<br />\nreplaces them with w's. The<br />\nresults are frightening:<br />\n\"I wuv you, my wittew wuvfingie, don't you twy to wun<br />\naway fworn me.\"<br />\nSad, but true. The Couple was<br />\nafflicted with Couples. A typical<br />\nday for myself and my male<br />\n<br />\nroommate, for example, consisted of: arising at noon, rummaging in the fridge for food,<br />\nmaybe a little racquetball in the<br />\nupstairs hallway, some cable TV,<br />\nand then a full evening's entertainment either drinking to the<br />\npoint of blindness with friends or<br />\nelse going to local alleys and<br />\nstealing carloads of milkcrates<br />\nwith which we would later build<br />\nbed frames.<br />\nThe Couple's typical day consisted of a twelve-course<br />\nbreakfast up in the breakfast nook<br />\nthey had set up in their bedroom<br />\n(no joke, they even called it a<br />\n\"nook\"), some vacuuming, sorting through the catalogs that arrived in the day's mail, a bit more<br />\nvacuuming, maybe going out to<br />\nsee what's new in Tupperware,<br />\nbuying a new attachment for the<br />\nvacuum, later preparing a sauce<br />\nor a dinner that wouldn't be<br />\nfinished for a week, and perhaps<br />\ncanning some preserves in the<br />\nevening. And of course,<br />\nvacuuming.<br />\nWe then realized the next<br />\nsymptom of Couples: obsession<br />\nwith the insignificant. It was this<br />\nvery symptom that led to the<br />\ndownfall of our happy home.<br />\nIt started harmlessly enough.<br />\nOne of the Couples told us that<br />\nwe were being lax in our dishwashing duties. Then they told us<br />\nnot to eat their food anymore, and<br />\nput masking tape on the food that<br />\nas to distinguish<br />\nthey bought<br />\nit from the food that we bought.<br />\nThen they began locking their<br />\nroom. As the days went by, we<br />\nfound more and more tape, now<br />\non the kitchen utensils that we<br />\nwere not allowed to use. At one<br />\npoint, it got so bad they threatened to revoke our knife privileges.<br />\nThe three of us were at a loss.<br />\nIt was around this time that we<br />\n(the non-Couples) coined the<br />\nnicknames for ourselves. Our<br />\nfemale n)ommate, who spread the<br />\nvicious propaganda between us<br />\ntwo non-Couples and the Couple,<br />\nbecame the Antagonizer. Myself<br />\nand my male nxmimates were the<br />\nInconsiderate Bastard Clones.<br />\nThe female Couplet was the<br />\nDemonic Hellwitch, or, if you<br />\nprefer, the DelMonte Hellwitch.<br />\n<br />\nso<br />\n<br />\nSee PUNCH,8<br />\n<br />\nKeep an eye on your investment<br />\nhas demonstrated that it is extremely sensitive to pressure<br />\nfrom parents and alumni. Your child will be receiving a<br />\nfirst-rate education at Johns Hopkins. Keep our far-tooglib administration aware that you will accept nothing less.<br />\n<br />\nWith the c.mpus crawling with prospective freshmen,<br />\nwe find ourse;,,es torn. While we are proud of Johns<br />\nHopkins, the Administration's conduct over the past two<br />\nyears has left us with serious doubts about the University's commitment to its Arts and Sciences. The publication last week of the course listings for next semester has<br />\nonly served to increase our anxiety.<br />\nAlthough there will be yet another 800-plus person<br />\nfreshman class gracing our lvwns come September\u2014part<br />\nof a University initiative to increase enrollment here by<br />\nten percent\u2014 there will be fewer courses offered than were<br />\navailable this past term. This dearth of coursework is due<br />\nin part to faculty sabbaticals, retirements, and the like. This<br />\nis not unusual or especially worrisome. It is also partly<br />\ndue to protracted faculty searches, whose paucity can be<br />\nattributed to the Five Year Plan's austerity.<br />\nThe problem is that the number of courses offered in<br />\nthe Humanities for fall term is exactly the same as was<br />\navailable during the fall of 1986. At that time, there were<br />\nover a hundred fewer freshmen entering our tiny University. While introductory classes, which often have sections,<br />\ncan more easily adapt to the larger enrolment, problems<br />\narise with smaller upper-level classes. More and more<br />\noften, once-small seminars have been overwhelmed and<br />\nturned into semi-lectures, or, less frequently, students are<br />\nsimply closed out of classes they need. Only one more<br />\nupper-level Humanities class is available this year than at<br />\nthe corresponding time four years ago.<br />\nThe number of upper-level Natural Science courses has<br />\nactually fallen eighteen percent from fall term 1986. If you<br />\nwant to know the effect that this is having on<br />\nundergraduates, ask any science major. They will almost<br />\ncertainly be able to elaborate further than we have. The<br />\ncrunch is moving at a somewhat slower pace through the<br />\nHumanities, but it is every bit as real.<br />\nIf you are a prospective freshman or a parent of a<br />\nfreshman, bear two things in mind. For all of Hopkins's<br />\ncurrent difficulties, it remains unique among private<br />\nAmerican universities: almost all classes here are taught<br />\nby tenure-track professors, with few exceptions. Your<br />\nchildren will rarely be taught by graduate students or temporary faculty. This is not true at almost any of of the nation's most prestigious schools. What is important,<br />\nhowever, is that you remain in close touch with events at<br />\nthe University. The (outgoipig, mercifully) administration<br />\n<br />\nCrime on the rise<br />\nAfter a look in this week's news section, many of you<br />\nwill think twice about walking alone to the local convenience store when a munchie attack strikes at midnight.<br />\nYou should also think twice, however, about running down<br />\nthe hallway to brush your teeth and leaving your dorm<br />\nroom unlocked.<br />\nA series of muggings and break-ins has occurred in<br />\nCharles Village this year and unfortunately no one, male<br />\nor female, student or professional, is exempt from being<br />\na potential victim. The secure and idyllic appearance of<br />\nthe Homewood campus makes it easy to forget that crime<br />\ndoes in fact pass through its gates. Baltimore is a highcrime city, and theives seem to be taking quite a liking<br />\nto Hopkins. For example, this week's campus crime report<br />\nfrom the Security Office listed four separate incidents of<br />\nwallets having been lifted from dorm rooms. All the rooms<br />\nhad been left unattended and unlocked. In some of the<br />\ncases, however, it took only seconds for the thief to gain<br />\naccess, take what was wanted, and leave.<br />\nOn a more dangerous note, a Hopkins student was apparently mugged last night, adding to the total number of<br />\nstudents who have found themselves in such a situation<br />\nduring the past few weeks. Although these incidents occurred off campus, they happened in areas frequented by<br />\nstudents. According to the police, extra patrols and<br />\nplainclothes officers have been assigned to the Charles<br />\nVillage area, but students need to assume responsibility<br />\nfor their safety as well. Walking in groups is a good way<br />\nto deter a potential mugger\u2014and is advocated by the<br />\npolice\u2014and the Hopkins security shuttle is available after<br />\n5 p.m..<br />\nThe News-Letter also thinks that it should go without<br />\nsaying that everyone should lock their door, whether its<br />\nto a dorm room, an apartment, an office, or a second-hand<br />\nBuick, even if they will only be gone \"a minute or two.\"<br />\nAfter all, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.<br />\nIt also might save you a few bucks and a lot of grief.<br />\n<br />\ninns,<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nRadio station<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs your article in today's issue<br />\nwill tell, Johns Hopkins will soon<br />\nbe ending its experiment with<br />\nnon-student radio.

Without a doubt, this<br />\nis the largest student-run project<br />\nto emerge on campus within the<br />\nlast decade. It will make a great<br />\ncontribution to campus life.<br />\nFor the people of Student<br />\nRadio, however, the job has only just begun.

I was awakened by<br />\nmy phone ringing. Since my<br />\nfriends and relatives know not to<br />\ncall me at that hour, I hoped it<br />\nwas for my housemate and decided to let my answering machine<br />\ntake the call. I figured that if it<br />\nwas an emergency I could still get<br />\nup. When my message was<br />\nthrough, I listened to see if I<br />\nrecognized the voice. What I<br />\nheard was several drunk men,<br />\nwho yelled,<br />\nYou fucking<br />\ncocksucker! We hope you die!\"<br />\nI can only assume that the<br />\nmessage was aimed at me, by<br />\npeople who know me to be the<br />\nvice-president of the Gay and<br />\nLesbian Alliance.<br />\nOver the past few weeks, letters to the editor have featured<br />\ntwo cases of sexual harassment on<br />\nHomewood Campus. Like my<br />\nphone message, both were verbal, and neither caused physical<br />\nharm. Many people would be<br />\nprone to discard these incidents<br />\nas unrelated, more-or-less<br />\nbelieving that they are symptomatic only of isolated jerks. We<br />\nmust resist this temptation. Verbal assaults, whether against<br />\nwomen, gays, or racial or ethnic<br />\nminorities are more than just<br />\nupsetting\u2014they are directly linked to the physical assaults these<br />\ngroups suffer, and create the atmosphere of fear and hatred that<br />\nkeep people from enjoying their<br />\nfull capacities for achievement<br />\nand freedom.<br />\nThe first step in oppression of<br />\nany form is the dehumanizing of<br />\nthe victim in the oppressor's<br />\nmind. This justifies both the<br />\nhatred and the use of violence.<br />\nFour men reduced Ms. Stephan<br />\nto her body parts by yelling<br />\n\"Look at them tithes!\" When she<br />\nlooked shocked they laughed\u2014<br />\nafter all, what right does a pair<br />\nof breasts have to respect?<br />\nMs. Vaidhyanathan was reduc<br />\ned to \"her\" race, when a man<br />\nyelled, \"I'm gonna fuck you all<br />\nthe way back to Korea!'.''(4ic --she's Indian.) This tactic is identical to that used by whites to<br />\njustify slavery and segregation in<br />\nAmerica, and is used today by<br />\nwhite South Africans.<br />\nI was reduced to an act, rather<br />\nthan a race or body part. From<br />\nmy position in GALA, the men<br />\nwho called me deduced, not that<br />\nI suck cocks, but that I am a<br />\ncocksucker. In their minds I am<br />\nno longer human, hut a thing, a<br />\ncocksucker. Thus, it is quite<br />\nnatural that they should wish me<br />\ndead, that I stop masquerading<br />\n(and perhaps corrupting) decent<br />\nhumans.<br />\nIn these cases, the assualt ended shortly after the dehumanizing<br />\nprocess. As I said, all of the<br />\nassualts were purely verbal.<br />\nHowever, these verbal assaults<br />\nare typical of assaults that become<br />\nphysical. Rape is a daily reality<br />\nin the lives of women, as is<br />\n\"queer-bashing\" in the lives of<br />\ngays, lesbians, and bisexuals. The<br />\nline between a threat of rape<br />\n(\"I'm going to fuck you.\") and<br />\nrape or between a death-wish<br />\n(\"We hope you die!\") and a<br />\nqueer-bashing is very thin. And<br />\n. even when there is no violence,<br />\nthe effects are often very damaging. Ms. Vaidhyanathan was terrified, and her fear lasted long<br />\npast reaching Shaffer Hall. Both<br />\nshe and Ms. Stephan told me that<br />\ntheir feelings about walking on<br />\nour campus are permanently<br />\nchanged. Mine is too.<br />\nIt is no coincidence that these<br />\nassaults were all committed by<br />\nmen. Men, particularly straight<br />\nmen, commit over 90 percent of<br />\nthe violence in America, often<br />\nwith numbers and alcohol to<br />\nbolster their courage and<br />\nrighteousness. What we must<br />\nrealize about these men in particular is that they are not uniquely deranged people that none of<br />\nus has ever met. Rather, they are<br />\nour classmates. Each of these<br />\nmen, with the possible (but highly<br />\ndoubtful) exception of my callers,<br />\nwere Hopkins students, part of<br />\nour community. They are common students we see everywhere.<br />\nWomen don't ask for walks and<br />\nrides home because they're afraid<br />\nthey might meet one of these<br />\nrapists in Baltimore, just as gays,<br />\nlesbians, and bisexuals don't stay<br />\n\"closeted\" because of a dozen<br />\n<br />\nfanatics with baseball bats. The<br />\nrapists and the queer-bashers, like<br />\nthose who limit themselves to<br />\nverbal assualts, are far more common than we might care to<br />\nbelieve. More importantly, in<br />\nterms of how we can go about<br />\nsolving this problem, their<br />\nbehavior is encouraged and enforced every time we do nothing<br />\nabout it. Every time we laugh, or<br />\nstay silent, when a sexist or racist<br />\njoke is told, or tell one ourselves,<br />\nwe are sending the message that<br />\nwe approve, that women and persons of color are not human.<br />\nEvery time someone uses a word<br />\nlike \"queer\" or \"fag\" or<br />\n\"slope\" or \"cunt\" to describe<br />\nsomeone and we say nothing, we<br />\nare approving. To refuse to act is<br />\nto act.<br />\nAt the risk of an irrelevant<br />\ndigression, I would like to end by<br />\naddressing the men who called<br />\nme. I do not know who you are,<br />\nor why you feel threatened by<br />\nme.

The war had begun.<br />\nWe should have seen the attacks coming, although the<br />\nfighting broke out in the Couple's<br />\ncamp. It began one day when<br />\nSpineless was doing the Couple's<br />\nlaundry and he thoughtlessly<br />\nthrew DelMonte's sweater into<br />\nthe dryer with the rest of his<br />\nacrylic ones. DelMonte came<br />\nhome, and then, and THEN,<br />\nAND THEN\u2014she saw HER<br />\nSWEATER\"<br />\n\"Spineless!!!!\" she bellowed,<br />\nYOU<br />\nHAVE<br />\n\"WHAT<br />\nDONE??? YOU SHRANK MY<br />\nWOOL SWEATER!!!! YOU<br />\nWILL SUFFER FOR THIS,<br />\nMORTAL!!\" and poor Spineless<br />\nwas wrapped in the flames of hell<br />\nand dragged into their bedroom.<br />\nThis became known in our<br />\nhouse as the Great Sweater<br />\nDebate.<br />\nWhat us three military minds<br />\ndidn't realize was that this battle<br />\nwas merely a diversionary tactic,<br />\nand the Couple had been in conference arranging alliance talks.<br />\nThe reason we missed these talks<br />\nwas that we two Bastard Clones<br />\nhad gone to the other Clone's<br />\nhouse for a weekend, largely to<br />\nclean out his parents' pantry. We<br />\nfound probably the world's<br />\nlargest supply of Hickory Farms<br />\nCheese and Cracker Spread<br />\nAssortments that people send as<br />\ngifts when they can't think of<br />\nanything else, and being as I am<br />\nthe world's biggest fan of those<br />\nlittle beefsticks that you get in<br />\nsuch assortments, we took them<br />\nall back to school with us, along<br />\nwith some deviled ham and a couple of Spams. Call it rations for<br />\nthe troops.<br />\nIn our absence, the Antagonizer had taken quite a liking<br />\nto cinnamon toast, and had begun<br />\neating it two, three, four times a<br />\nday. In fact, when we returned,<br />\nwhile us Clones put away our<br />\nbeefsticks, the Antagonizer fretted over the fact that the lid to her<br />\ncinnamon container had become<br />\nunhinged, and she had to fix it<br />\n<br />\nwith masking tape.<br />\nOne day, of course, the<br />\nbeefsticks were gone. I was away<br />\nweeping, and the other Clone<br />\nwent into the kitchen to have the<br />\nAntagonizer teach him the art of<br />\nmaking cinnamon toast in order<br />\nthat he might be able to maintain<br />\nhis strength during wartime.<br />\nThe Couple seized upon this<br />\nmoment of military weakness,<br />\nand Spineless stormed into the<br />\nkitchen, where the Antagonizer<br />\nhad just picked up the cinnamon.<br />\n\"That's ours, you know,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"We bought it. You're<br />\neating our food.\"<br />\nIt turned out that the neutral<br />\nsupply of cinnamon had been used up long ago in one of<br />\nDelMonte's dinner masterpieces.<br />\nShe had had to go out and buy a<br />\nnew supply. The masking tape<br />\nthat had appeared on the container was our clue to HANDS<br />\nOFF, not a repair on the hinge.<br />\nWell, being caught in this warcrime as they were, after<br />\nSpineless left the field, the Antagonizer graciously left two<br />\nnickels on the container of cinnamon to pay for the supply that<br />\nshe had filched. The field was<br />\nempty.<br />\nLater, upon my return from<br />\nweeping, I went into the kitchen<br />\nto feed my sorrow. I opened the<br />\nsome<br />\nmoved<br />\nfridge,<br />\nand\u2014<br />\naround,<br />\nstuff<br />\nwhat was this? There was! There<br />\nwas!! There was one beefstick<br />\nleft! Huzzah!! I danced into the<br />\nstreet as I polished off the<br />\nmanufactured meat by-products.<br />\nLater, the Clone and the Antagonizer returned to the kitchen<br />\nto find something to eat in the<br />\nstead of the cinnamon toast that<br />\nthey so dearly craved. Finding<br />\nnothing tapeless, they sat and<br />\nsulked.<br />\nSpineless marched in determinedly to the fridge, preparing<br />\nto extricate and devour the<br />\nHickory Farms beefstick that had<br />\narrived in the mail from his<br />\nmother only that morning as an<br />\nEaster present. To his utter hor-<br />\n<br />\nror, the Cheese and Cracker<br />\nSpread Assortment was there, but<br />\nwhere there should have been a<br />\nplastic-wrapped delight, there<br />\nwas merely an indentation in the<br />\ngreen plastic grass.<br />\nMY<br />\nATE<br />\n\"WHO<br />\nBEEFSTICK?\" he cried, turning<br />\nand glaring at the Clone and the<br />\nAntagonizer.

It<br />\nis very unlikely that you have<br />\never met him, but he was gay. He<br />\ndied over Spring Break, due to<br />\ncomplications from medicine he<br />\nwas taking for AIDS.

Charles Dove, of the English<br />\nDept., requested $486 for a series<br />\nof short, experimental films,<br />\nmostly from the '60s. $500 was<br />\ngranted.<br />\nb. Two representatives, Andrew Bragen and Jeff Pruzan,<br />\nfrom Lemniscate, a campus<br />\nliterary publication, came armed<br />\nwith a revised budget request: this<br />\ntime for $650, down from the<br />\n$1000 they asked for before. The<br />\nSAC will provide about that<br />\namount, too. After some debate,<br />\n$500 was granted.<br />\nc. Alan Keenan and Amy<br />\nWygant requested that money be<br />\nset aside for a symposium to be<br />\nheld next fall to celebrate a conference that was held at Hopkins<br />\n25 years ago, considered at the<br />\ntime to have been a milestone in<br />\nthe development of literary<br />\nstudies. The cost would be at least<br />\n$4500. Seeing as how only $3500<br />\nis left in this year's symposium<br />\nbudget (which can be rolled<br />\nover), this would have meant<br />\ncommitting money from next<br />\nyear's budget. not yet appropriated. The discussion was<br />\ncomplicated further by the fact of<br />\n<br />\nanother symposium request.<br />\nd. Some students from the<br />\nHispanic and Italian Studies<br />\nDept., spoken for principally by<br />\nJulia Hairston, wished to know<br />\nhow to go about making a funding<br />\nrequest for a symposium on<br />\nWomen's Studies in Italian<br />\nStudies, to be held this Nov. This<br />\nwould need at least $5000,<br />\nthough not all of this was expected to come from the GRO.<br />\nThe debate then focussed primarily on whether it is right for the<br />\noutgoing GRO council to pledge<br />\nnot-yet appropriated money on<br />\nbehalf of a still as-yet unelected<br />\n1990-91 GRO council. GRO Cochair Joanne Houlihan and<br />\nSecretary Munro suggested that<br />\nthe GRO might make it policy as<br />\nof now to have the first act of the<br />\nnew council (or at least new<br />\ncouncil officers, the members remaining in their posts till Sept.)<br />\nbe to decide upon symposium<br />\nfunding for the following year. (It<br />\nwas agreed by all that it was<br />\nreasonable to decide these matters<br />\na year before the actual symposium because they take so long<br />\nto organize.) The matter was<br />\nresolved by requesting the<br />\nfunding-requesters to resubmit on<br />\n4 May, by which time the new<br />\nGRO officers will have been<br />\nelected.<br />\nGRO HANDBOOK<br />\nThe GRO handbook, Living in<br />\nBaltimore, will be revised this<br />\nsummer and reissued in the fall.<br />\nThe book was last released in the<br />\nfall of 1988.

In both<br />\ngames the stakes were high, and<br />\nin both the Jays had their good<br />\nand bad moments.<br />\nLast Thursday, Hopkins claimed its second consecutive MAC<br />\nWest division championship.<br />\nAfter blazing through their first<br />\nthree western contests, winning<br />\nall three by an aggregate 48-14<br />\nscore, the Jays needed a victory<br />\nagainst 7-0 Washington College<br />\nat Chestertown to advance to the<br />\nMAC final against the Eastern<br />\nsection winner.<br />\nThe Jays delivered.<br />\nHopkins scored on half of their<br />\n20 first-half shots en route to a<br />\n10-2 halftime edge, with junior<br />\nKathy Herring, co-captain Patty<br />\n<br />\nLagator, junior home Tara<br />\nFrame, and junior attack wing<br />\nCathy Moskal firing in two scores<br />\neach.<br />\nJunior home Kara Tipton and<br />\nsophomore home Jessica Tropp<br />\nboth tallied once in the half.<br />\nHopkins stumbled and nearly<br />\nfell in the second half. Outshot<br />\n14-8, the Jays weathtred a fierce<br />\nWashington rally to prevail 11-9.<br />\nOnly Herring's third goal of the<br />\nmatch prevented a second-half<br />\nblanking.<br />\nJunior Kristin Cole finished<br />\nwith 14 saves.<br />\nWith the West won, the Jays<br />\nfaced the 5-2 Franklin and Marshall Diplomats at Homewood on<br />\nSaturday. A win would have<br />\nstrengthened the Jay's chances for<br />\na bid to the eight team N.C.A.A.<br />\nDivision III tournament, but<br />\nF&M had other ideas.<br />\nThe Jays defeated the<br />\nDiplomats twice last year, a 10-8<br />\n<br />\nregular season win at Lancaster,<br />\nand a 13-8 victory in the 1989<br />\nMAC final at Homewood.<br />\n\"Last year they [Hopkins] shut<br />\ndown our best player, and that<br />\nmade all the difference in the<br />\nworld,\" said F&M coach<br />\nHeather Setzler. \"This year our<br />\nattack is more balanced.\"<br />\nHopkins started poorly. The<br />\nDiplomats opened a 3-0 edge at<br />\n19:14, displaying their speed,<br />\nsound defense, and transitional<br />\nskills. The Jays had their share of<br />\npossesion time, but could not<br />\ncreate quality shots.<br />\nThat changed when junior<br />\nhome Kara Tipton rifled in a<br />\nbounce shot from 10 yards out at<br />\n18:31 to make it 3-1. Nearly three<br />\nminutes later Tipton parted two<br />\nDiplomat defenders and bounced<br />\nin another score to trim tne Jays'<br />\ndeficit to one.<br />\nF&M tallied at 11:35 to lead<br />\n4-2, but at 9:16 freshman defense<br />\n<br />\nwing Kathy Sokolowski intercepted an F&M clear and fed<br />\nFrame, who with deft stickwork<br />\neluded an F&M defender to score<br />\nfrom close range.<br />\nThen, as they would do for the<br />\nrest of the game, F&M replied<br />\nemphatically to the Hopkins goal,<br />\nnetting three to go up 7-3. The<br />\nDiplomats dominated this portion<br />\nof the game, controlling the ball<br />\nand moving quickly up and down<br />\nthe field.<br />\nThe Jays persevered though,<br />\nand after Frame beat two<br />\ndefenders for her second score at<br />\n1:12, Hopkins had halted their<br />\nskid.<br />\nWith 20 seconds remaining,<br />\nco-captain Julie Siegrist outran a Diplomat to a ball near the<br />\nsideline, and on a restart spotted<br />\nunmarked defense wing Jen Chun<br />\n10 yards from the cage.<br />\nChun promptly bounced in her<br />\nsixth goal of the year with nine<br />\nseconds left, and the Jays were<br />\nback in business, down 7-5.<br />\nOnly 30 seconds had passed in<br />\nthe second half when Frame cut<br />\ninto the open and scored. F&M<br />\nthen made it 8-6, but another<br />\nFrame goal, her fourth of the<br />\ngame, again put Hopkins within<br />\none.<br />\nF&M dashed the Jays' momentum with 2 scores. Trailing 10-7,<br />\nthe Jays then got a boost when<br />\nJulie<br />\nAll-American defender<br />\nSiegrist scored her first ever collegiate goal.<br />\n\"I didn't think about anything<br />\n[after recording her first score],\"<br />\nSiegrist said. \"I just wanted to<br />\nwin the game.\"<br />\nBut Hopkins would get no<br />\ncloser. Though the Jays maintaned their high work-rate, they<br />\ncould not contain F&M's swift,<br />\npersistent offense.<br />\n\"F&M has a really strong attack . . . they have good shot<br />\nplacement,\" Anderson said.<br />\n<br />\nAfter Siegrist's goal, Herring<br />\nand Tropp tallied twice, and<br />\nLagator contributed a score to the<br />\nJay's comeback bid, but F&M<br />\nprevailed 15-13, dropping the<br />\nJays to 6-3. Cole had 7 saves in<br />\nthe Hopkins goal.<br />\n\"We didn't play up to par,<br />\nCoach Anderson said. \"We had<br />\na two-week stretch where we<br />\nplayed a lot of games, and our<br />\nplayers were a little tired.\"<br />\nThe loss damages but does not<br />\nruin the Jays shot at the<br />\nN.C.A.A. tournameni \"I think<br />\nif we win the M.A.C. we'll be all<br />\nright,\" Lagator said. \"That's our<br />\nchance,\" Anderson agreed.<br />\nAfter nine games, Lagator<br />\nleads the team in total points with<br />\n35(18g.,17a.) while Tipton, with<br />\n22 goals, leads in that department.

The win<br />\nover Haverford was especially<br />\nsignificant, as Hopkins hasn't<br />\ndefeated them since 1987.<br />\n\"Beating Haverford was a big<br />\nwin,\" head coach Bill Nelson<br />\ncommented. \"They're one of the<br />\ntop teams in the region.\"<br />\nRyu Iwai lost to Haverford's<br />\nfirst singles player 1-6, 3-6, and<br />\nBill Braude fell at #4, 4-6, 7-6,<br />\n2-6, but Hopkins won all of the<br />\nother singles matches to take a<br />\n4-2 lead going into the doubles.<br />\nLorin Engquist won by the<br />\nunusual score of 0-6, 6-2, 6-4 in<br />\nsecond singles. His opponent was<br />\na serve-and-volley player with a<br />\nbig serve, and Engquist benefited<br />\nnoticeably when the tennis balls<br />\nstarted going dead. Haverford's<br />\nplayer requested new balls at the<br />\nstart of the third set, which is the<br />\ncustom at some schools.<br />\nHowever, the home team<br />\nmakes those decisions, and<br />\nHopkins does not provide a new<br />\ncan of balls.<br />\nTed Roth won at third singles,<br />\n7-5, 6-1, employing a power<br />\nbaseline game. Roth is known for<br />\nhis big forehand, but seems reluctant to come into the net to take<br />\nadvantage of opponents' weak<br />\nreturns. As a result he has to hit<br />\nseveral good shots in a row to win<br />\neach point.<br />\nLuckily for Hopkins, he was<br />\nable to do that against Haverford.<br />\n\"I feel it's necessary to hit as<br />\nmany forehands as possible as<br />\nhard as possible,\" Roth said,<br />\ndescribing his barbarian-like tactics. \"I like to bring people into<br />\nnet and then peg them.\"<br />\nSam Kim, who seems to have<br />\nthree-set marathons every match<br />\nhe plays, came through for<br />\nHopkins at the #5 slot, winniag<br />\n4-6, 6-0, 7-5. Mike Kim edged<br />\nhis opponent 6-4, 7-5.<br />\nIn the doubles, Hopkins<br />\nbrought in their doubles<br />\nspecialists, Jon Missner and<br />\nFrancois Erasmus. Missner team-<br />\n<br />\ned with Braude at second doubles<br />\nto clinch the match for Hopkins<br />\nwith a 6-2, 7-6 win in a controversial match.<br />\nWith Hopkins up 5-2 in the second set, Missner and Braude accused the Haverford team of<br />\ncheating on consecutive points.<br />\nAn argument ensued, but the calls<br />\nstood and Haverford came back<br />\nto tie the set at 5-5 before<br />\nHopkins won in a tiebreak. \"I'm<br />\nglad we won because they were<br />\ncheating and heckling us,\"<br />\nMissner said after the match.<br />\n..Ermmus and Kim teamed up to<br />\nwin at third doubles, 1-6, 7-6,<br />\n7-6, and Engquist and lwai lost<br />\nat #1 7-5, 1-6, 6-7 to account for<br />\nthe final 6-3 margin.<br />\nThe day before, Hopkins<br />\ndefeated an overmatched Ursinus<br />\nteam 6-3.<br />\nThe team fell to Washington on<br />\nMonday, 9-0, as expected.<br />\nWashington recruits players from<br />\nall over the world, including<br />\nSouth Africa and Spain, and<br />\nseems to retain them year after<br />\nyear.<br />\nIwai, at #1, and Missner, playing at #6, were the only players<br />\nto win more than three games<br />\ntotal in the singles. Missner and<br />\nBraude fell 7-5, 7-5 at second<br />\ndoubles, which was Hopkins'<br />\nclosest loss on the day.<br />\nCoach Nelson is more than<br />\nsatisfied with the team's performance so far. \"I'm ecstatic,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"The impressive thing<br />\nabout our team is the guys at the<br />\nbottom are really competitors.<br />\nWe can go eight deep this year.\"<br />\nIndeed, when Hopkins has its<br />\nfull lineup, its number four<br />\nthrough six players (Sam Kim,<br />\nMike Kim, and either Braude or<br />\nRoth) are a combined 11-1 on the<br />\nseason. Hopkins also has an<br />\nedge over most teams in doubles<br />\nbecause of Missner and Erasmus.<br />\n\"The last few matches will depend upon our doubles<br />\nspecialists, Jon Missner and<br />\nFrancois, who have been playing<br />\nespecially well,\" predicted senior<br />\ncaptain lwai. Hopkins closes<br />\nout the season with three very<br />\nhard matches, against Dickinsor<br />\nFranklin & Marshall (Friday a<br />\n3:00 p.m. at Hopkins), and<br />\nGettysburg.<br />\n<br />\nMen's track places four<br />\nTRACK, from 16<br />\nboth the distance and sprint teams<br />\nare steadily improving, adding to<br />\nthe confidence level of the team<br />\ngoing into the meet. Sophomore<br />\nJohn Robinson has already<br />\nqualified for the MAC's in both<br />\nthe 15(X) meter and the 3000<br />\nsteeplechase and is expected to<br />\nperform well.<br />\nAfter the next meet at<br />\nHomewood, the team travels to<br />\nMessiah for a tri-meet against<br />\n<br />\nMessiah and Swarthmore. Both<br />\nare strong squads and the Jays<br />\nhope to be in full stride by the<br />\ntime this meet arrives. Also, the<br />\nMAC's are only three weeks<br />\naway, which starts to add a little<br />\npressure to those who have not<br />\nalready qualified. Coach Garner<br />\nstated, \"Right now we have five<br />\npeople qualified for the MAC's,<br />\nbut I feel this is a good number<br />\nof people who need just a little<br />\nmore work and they will he there,<br />\ntoo.''<br />\n<br />\nby Paul Kang<br />\nHopkins rugby rebounded from<br />\na 16-15 loss to thrash St. Mary's<br />\nCollege 57-4. Hopkins seemed<br />\npumped from the start as they<br />\njumped to a quick 18-0 lid in the<br />\nfirst 20 minutes of the game.<br />\nScores were posted by Brad<br />\nErikson, Jim Gomez; and Phil<br />\nSmith. Five minutes before the<br />\nend of the half, Smith made a<br />\nbehind-the-head pass to an open<br />\nTurfman Cena, who rumbled in<br />\nfor the score.<br />\nThe second half' provided no<br />\ndrop in intensity for Hopkins, as<br />\nthey scored at will against a larger<br />\nand faster team. Dietrich Schultz<br />\nalone made a hat trick with 15<br />\nminutes left in the game. His<br />\nspectacular off-balance shot past<br />\nthe goalie made the score 37-0,<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nWith two minutes left in the<br />\ngame, Hopkins was on the verge<br />\nof their third shutout, but one of<br />\nSt. Mary's props sidestepped a<br />\nJoe McCullough tackle and<br />\noutraced him to the end zone.

I think it<br />\nwas a huge success,\" said<br />\nwomen's captain Kim Roberts.<br />\nAlthough racing conditions on<br />\nthe 2000-meter course were excellent for the morning heats,<br />\nstrong winds forced Coach Perry<br />\nto call off six final events in the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nThe Hopkins women's varsity<br />\nteam made a good showing at<br />\ntheir own regatta. The<br />\nlightweight eight pulled a secondplace 8:00.73 to George<br />\nWashington University's 7:37.11<br />\nin the finals of their event.

The men's lightweight four<br />\nbrought home a third-place<br />\noverall behind boats from Pittsburgh and Stockton State. In the<br />\nfastest heat of the men's novice<br />\neight race, Hopkins finished a<br />\nrespectable third and gained<br />\n<br />\nvaluable racing experience which<br />\nwill undoubtedly contribute to<br />\nthis promising young boat's<br />\nfuture success.<br />\nIn more intensive competition<br />\nat the George Wa ington Invitational Regatta on the Potomac<br />\nRiver, Hopkins crews rowed<br />\nagainst schools such as<br />\nGeorgetown, Temple, George<br />\nWashington, George Mason, the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia, and the<br />\ntraditional rowing powerhouse of<br />\nthe Naval Academy. Despite<br />\nchoppy water conditions, the varsity women's four remained<br />\nundefeated, finishing with an<br />\n8:32 and several boatlengths of<br />\nopen water over second-place<br />\nNavy at 8:58 and Georgetown at<br />\n9:30. Three-seat Ingeborg Schlate<br />\nwas happy with the win but \"had<br />\nhoped for a tougher race.\" We're<br />\nlooking forward to a more competitive race next weekend at the<br />\nLa Salle Invitational in Camden,<br />\nNew Jersey.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins men's heavy four<br />\nalso conquered the rough water<br />\nand opposing crews. They edged out Navy by five seconds, earning the right to enjoy a couple<br />\nof traditional crew rituals. They<br />\ncollected racing shirts from each<br />\nof the teams in their final event<br />\n(George<br />\nWashington,<br />\nGeorgetown, and Navy)and tossed coxswain E.K. Kim off the<br />\ndock and into the cold river<br />\nwater. Said bowman Erik Plautz,<br />\n\"I'm glad we won, but I'm really<br />\npsyched that I scored a Navy<br />\nshirt!\"<br />\nRowing in a different qualifying heat of the same event, the<br />\nHopkins lightweight four came in<br />\nwithin three seconds of George<br />\nWashington University. This was<br />\nan impressive performance for a<br />\nlightweight boat against some<br />\ntough heavyweight competition.<br />\nThe men's novice eight also put<br />\nup a good fight against some excellent crews in their event.<br />\n<br />\nBIA Chunks<br />\nby J.F.

When it<br />\ncame time for him to choose a<br />\ncollege, Hopkins was an easy<br />\nchoice. \"I knew what the school<br />\nand its lacrosse was all about. If<br />\nI had a choice to do it over again,<br />\nI'd still come to Hopkins.\"<br />\nTo be competitive in any collegiate sport, it is necessary to do<br />\na good job of recruiting. To Jay,<br />\n\"it is the biggest aspect of any<br />\nprogram because if you don't<br />\nhave the players, I don't think<br />\nyou'll win it all, no matter how<br />\ngood the coach is.<br />\n\"In years past, the best players<br />\nalways came to Hopkins. Back<br />\nthen, there weren't so many good<br />\nplayers and the game wasn't as<br />\nspread out. Now, there are both<br />\ngood coaches and players all over<br />\nthe East coast. The competition<br />\nis tougher. Hopkins still gets<br />\ngreat players, but other teams are<br />\ngetting them too. Overall, it<br />\nmakes for a better game.\"<br />\nThis season has been tough for<br />\nthe team as they have had to deal<br />\nwith a four-game losing streak.<br />\n\"It's been a new experience for<br />\nall of us.

He indicated that the committee's approach has been both statistical<br />\nand anecdotal, with data coming,<br />\nfrom the registrar's office, student surveys and interviews, and<br />\ncomments of department chairs.<br />\nHe said that he requested the<br />\nreport be revised because<br />\n\"basically, as [the Howard committee] brought forth preliminary<br />\nreports, I found pathways that<br />\nmight need to be explored a little<br />\nmore\u2014I wanted to focus on the<br />\nproblems that had been caused so<br />\nwe could attack them.<br />\n\"You don't want to start up<br />\nanother committee just to deal<br />\nwith a few unanswered questions,\" he continued, \"so I sent<br />\nthem back.\"<br />\nHe also felt that some of the<br />\nHoward committee's statistics<br />\nhad been pointing in directions<br />\nthat were unexplored, and he had<br />\nbeen concerned with the accuracy<br />\nand validity of some of the newest<br />\nstatistics. He indicated that the<br />\ncurrent revision requires only<br />\nminor changes in the report based on additional data.<br />\n\"I hoped it would have been<br />\nout in January,\" he said, \"but it<br />\nwas a more massive task than we<br />\nanticipated, and in any case it will<br />\ncertainly be done by the end of<br />\nthis semester.''<br />\nAsked if releasing the report<br />\nthis late would help students<br />\nregistering for classes now, Armstrong responded, \"I would<br />\nrather that it be accurate than early. The students talk to each<br />\nother, and you know yourselves<br />\nwhat you want to avoid or take;<br /><br />\nthe report won't be as useful for<br />\nstudents as it will be for the administration, which will help<br />\nthem to isolate the problems and<br />\ndeal with them so the students<br />\nwon't have to worry about it.\"<br />\nAccording to Armstrong, next<br />\nyear's enrollment will be the<br />\nsame size as this year's with no<br />\nplanned increase. As to whether<br />\nenrollment would be smaller or<br />\nnot in the future, he said, \"I don't<br />\nknow. It is my feeling that we<br />\ndon't want to get any larger: the<br />\nquestion is, is this a sustainable<br />\nsize? The objective is clearly to<br />\ncontinue to provide a quality<br />\neducation.\"<br />\nTwo-track Calculus courses<br />\nHe concluded that there would<br />\nbe no easy solutions, although he<br />\ndid agree that the \"two-track\"<br />\nsystem of the Department of<br />\nMathematics to reduce the size of<br />\nlecture classes was a good beginning point.<br />\nThe Mathematics Department<br />\nhas, at Dean Armstrong's insistence, split its calculus courses<br />\ninto calculus for premedical<br />\nstudents and calculus for physical<br />\nscience majors. Starting next<br />\nyear, the introductory physics<br />\ncourse will be split up the same<br />\nway.<br />\nArmstrong said that other solutions will have to be applied<br />\nelsewhere, citing the need \"not<br />\nonly to get beginning and intro<br />\nclasses down to about 40 or so,<br />\nbut upper division classes down<br />\nto 15\u2014there's nothing a priori<br />\nwrong with large lectures, but a<br />\nstudent shouldn't have four years<br />\nof them\u2014there has to be the opportunity for small, intimate<br />\nclasses.\"<br />\nHe indicated that a variety of<br />\napproaches would be tried, with<br />\nthe goal in mind of increasing the<br />\ninteraction between students and<br />\nfaculty members, a feat difficult<br />\nto achieve in a classes of\"300 or<br />\nso\" students.<br />\nGiangiulio noted that eittmy of<br />\nthe problems discussed by the<br />\ncommittee did not arise from the<br />\nFive-Year Plan but began during<br />\nthe '70s.<br />\nAccording to Giangiulio, many of<br />\nthe problems stemmed from lack<br />\nof coordination and communica-<br /><br />\ntion between the various<br />\ndepartments.<br />\n\"When Hopkins started admitting more social science and<br />\nhumanities majors,\" he explained, \"the departmcnts weren't told<br />\nto prepare for the influx, so there<br />\nwere huge growths in the social<br />\nscience students and a decrease in<br />\nfaculty; whereas, natural science<br />\nenrollments have decreased<br />\npercentage-wise while their<br />\nfaculty has gone up.\"<br />\nThere are now more students in<br />\nupper-level courses and more<br />\nfreshmen in 100-level courses<br />\nthan ever before, he said.<br />\n\"You now have some upper levei<br />\ncourses that are supposed to be<br />\ntaught like a seminar, but if it's<br />\nseminar style with eighty people,<br />\nthen it's really a lecture.\"<br />\n600-level enrollment down<br />\nGiangiulio also decried the increasing separation of the<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate programs at Hopkins.<br />\nThe number of undergraduates<br />\nenrolled in 600-level courses fell<br />\ndrastically between the fall of<br />\n1980 and this year. Giangiulio attributed this decline to the fact<br />\nthat faculty members are<br />\ndiscouraging undergraduates<br />\nfrom taking graduate level<br />\ncourses.<br />\n\"A lot of people have been<br />\nstifled,\" he added. \"Senior<br />\ntheses have almost become optional unless you want Honors<br />\nfrom your department. Independent study has had a stunning<br />\ndecline, and 600-level enrollment<br />\nhas gone way down.<br />\n\"The committee just wants to let<br />\nthe deans and new president<br />\nknow the situation; department<br />\nchairs were never told to prepare<br />\nnew programs, so now we have<br />\nto compensate. It's just that<br />\nsimple.\"<br />\nProfessor Howard, when<br />\nqueried about the report, said, \"It<br />\ndoes have serious implications.<br />\nBut it's ultimately up to the Dean\"<br />\nwhen it's going to be released<br />\nE4Faufite hc has to sign it aiyap<br />\nit his sign of approval.

In contrast,<br />\nmany classes at Columbia, for example, are taught either by<br />\nvisiting professors, non-tenure<br />\ntrack faculty, or graduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\n\"It's become impossible,\" said<br />\nProfessor of History Ronald<br />\nWalters, \"for us [the History<br />\nfaculty] to teach the kinds of<br />\ncourses that we most want to<br />\nteach and which are most<br />\nbeneficial to students\u2014the small<br /><br />\nrintilag7\"<br />\nClass sizes in the History<br />\ndepartment, like many others in<br />\nthe Arts and Sciences, are already<br />\nbeing pushed to the limit by the<br />\nincrease in the number of<br />\nstudents. These pressures have<br />\nbeen amplified by a slew of faculty retirements. Although the<br />\nretirements will allow the University to invigorate its faculty in the<br />\nlong run, the current shortage<br />\ncomes at a sensitive time for<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nWalters suggested that University support in the form of<br />\nresearch assistants and secretarial<br />\nhelp for faculty research efforts<br />\nhas not been forthcoming; in-<br /><br />\nstead, faculty members have been<br />\nkept busy with time consuming<br />\nmanagerial chores which, at other<br />\nuniversities, is often done for<br />\nthem.<br />\n\"If you look at schools of comparable quality to Hopkins, a very<br />\nhigh proportion of their classes<br />\nare not taught by permanent<br />\nfaculty,\" said Walters. At<br />\nHopkins, in contrast, \"a very<br />\nsmall faculty does a great deal of<br />\nteaching,\" while the University<br />\n\"supports faculty research at a<br />\nvery low level\u2014we don't have<br />\nthe research funds that other<br />\nuniversities have.\" Such shortfalls, suggested Walters, reflect<br />\nmany \"hidden impacts of the<br />\nbudget crisis.\"<br />\nJean McGarry, an Associate<br />\nProfessor in the Writing<br />\nSeminars, noted that \"we [the<br />\nfaculty] bend over backwards\u2014<br />\nand sideways\u2014to get students into classes.

The<br />\nWriting Seminars have added<br />\nfour or five CAL 'Contemporary<br />\nAmerican Letters] sections.\"<br />\nBlossoming numbers of sections have been particularly evident in departments like<br />\nEconomics, Biology, and<br />\nChemistry, which have very large<br />\nsurvey classes.<br />\nMcGarry said that the Writing<br />\nSeminars employs many parttime faculty members and<br />\ngraduate students to teach, \"so<br />\nwe haven't gotten to the point<br /><br />\nwhere we have forty people per<br />\nclass\u2014which is impossible.\" She<br />\nreflected on her experiences as an<br />\nundergraduate at Harvard and<br />\nnoted that \"if someone is giving<br />\na lecture, class size doesn't really matter\u2014but it's not really a<br />\ndiscussion.\"<br />\nMany upper level classes, particularly those which require<br />\nlower level coursework as a<br />\nprerequisite for admission, have<br />\nnot yet felt the pressure from the<br />\nrecently enlarged student body.<br />\nProfessor of Economics Louis<br />\nMaccini observed that \"my current class, Macro-Economic<br />\nTheory, is if anything slightly<br />\nsmaller than last year. It [increased undergraduate enrollment] has<br />\nnot yet materially affected that<br />\nclass.\"<br />\nIn the long run, however, as<br />\nthe class of 1994 and its successors move through the University, it seems pressure can only<br />\nbuild on already strained departments.

Harry Pouder Memorial Lecture Series. University President<br />\nSteven Muller, while introducing<br />\nBradbury, remarked that \"few<br />\nauthors come with such instant<br />\nrecognition\" as the 70-year old<br />\nauthor did Tuesday night. President Muller attributed much of<br />\nBradbury's recognition to the<br />\nwriter's \"vivid style\" which is<br />\nobvious in the 25 books and 400<br />\nshort stories\u2014The Martian<br />\nChronicles, Farhenheit 451, The<br />\nIllustrated Man, Dandelion Wine,<br />\nto name a few titles\u2014that he<br />\npenned in his 58 years of writing.<br />\n\"Ray<br />\nBradbury<br />\nis a<br />\nphenomenon of nature,\" Muller<br />\nsaid. \"Bradbury's imagination is<br />\ndark and bright, brooding, and<br />\nunfettered. He is the master of<br />\nsuspense, science fiction, horror<br />\n. . . But Mr. Bradbury prefers the<br />\nterm 'magical realist.\"<br />\nFrom the outset, Bradbury captivated the audience that packed<br />\nShriver Hall with light-hearted<br />\nanecdotes of his life. Through his<br />\nstories Bradbury conveyed the<br />\nmessage that one should pursue<br />\none's dreams at any cost despite<br />\nwhat others may think.<br />\n\"I love Buck Rogers,\" Bradbury said. \"If you love something<br />\nmadly enough, you shouldn't<br />\ngive it up. I loved Buck Rogers<br />\nso much that I collected Buck<br />\nRogers comic strips all the time<br /><br />\nwhen I was nine. People in the<br />\nfifth grade made fun of me, so I<br />\nended up tearing up eight week's<br />\nworth of Buck Rogers . . . And<br />\nthen I cried. I asked myself why<br />\n. . . Who had died? Why was I<br />\ncrying? . . . Then I realized that<br />\nI had died . . . From that point on<br />\nI decided to hell with what other<br />\npeople think . . . And I still collect everything that I love<br />\nAccording to Bradbury, \"This<br />\nmad love is going to pay off<br />\nsomewhere if you stick to it.\" He<br />\ncited his love for dinosaurs, the<br />\nBible, and Shakespeare as \"midwives of himself,\" just at the Bible and Shakespeare were the<br />\n\"midwives\" of Herman<br />\nMelville's Moby Dick. He attributed his succes to \"staying in<br />\nlove with the things I stayed in<br />\nlove with.\"<br />\nAnother major theme Bradbury<br />\ndiscussed is the idea that people<br />\nknow more than they realize.<br />\n\"We all sponge away existence<br />\neveryday but don't realize it's<br />\nthere without testing it,\" Bradbury said. \"Because we don't experiment, we don't ever know<br />\nhow much we really have. Our<br />\nmind is like a rain barrel in the<br />\nsummertime . . . By the end of<br />\nsummer, the water has collected is from the whole summer.<br />\nAll you have to so is reach down<br />\ninto the barrel deep enough and<br />\nyou'll have summer in your grasp<br /><br />\nToward the end of his presentation, Bradbury mentioned his<br />\nviews on education. He staunchly<br />\nbelieves it is \"time we give rejection slips for bad teachers.\"<br />\nHe favors taking education away<br />\nfrom the government and giving<br />\nit to private institutuions.<br />\n\"We need to fire those teachers<br />\nwho can't teach otherwise we'll<br />\nall suffer,\" he said.<br />\nBradbury also forsees a future<br />\nfull of videotapes.<br />\n\"Pretty soon everything will be<br />\ndone on videotapes, so we can<br />\npop them in whenever it's convenient for us,\" he said. \"Take<br />\nwhat it will do for politics . . .<br />\nwe'll be able to hear what those<br />\ncandidates say whenever WE<br />\nwant to hear it, and we can rewind the thing to hear their lies<br />\nover and over and over if we<br />\nwant<br />\nThis love for the future and<br />\npredicting that lies ahead for<br />\nmankind is an integral part of Ray<br />\nBradbury's interests.<br />\n\"People ask me why I write<br />\nscience fiction,\" he said. \"I say<br />\nsimply that there is no other fiction to write. Our whole history<br />\nis science fiction. Science fiction<br />\nbegan in the caves, with the<br />\nheiroglyphic tales of survival . . .<br />\nAll things that happen to us has<br />\nto do with technology in some<br />\nway . . . I write science fiction<br />\nbecause there is nothing else to<br />\nwrite<br />\n1<br /><br />\nRADIO, from 1<br />\nThe University will also provide the JHSRC with the space<br />\nneeded to operate the station. It<br />\nhas not been decided whether the<br />\nJHSRC will be allowed to use the<br />\nroom in the Lazear house of<br />\nAMR II, from which the radio<br />\nstation had previously been run.<br />\nPresident of the JHSRC Brian<br />\nLiddcoat said, \"It appears we<br />\nwill be able to keep the space, but<br />\nit is by no means definitive.\"<br />\nThe additional costs of setting<br />\nup the station in the AMR<br />\nresidences will be approximately $3,500. The JHSRC is contacting alumni and other outside<br />\nsources to solicit support. Assuming that these costs are met, the<br />\nJHSRC hopes to begin programming by next year's freshman<br />\norientation week although the<br />\nJHSRC engineerrs will not be<br />\navailable during the summer.<br />\nLiddicoat is confident, however<br />\nthat the radio station will be fully operational by the middle of<br />\nthe fall 1990 semester.<br />\nArt Yoon, who will be acting<br />\nas the JHSRC representative over<br />\nthe summer, attributed the success of the radio station to the<br />\nJHSRC members. \"If it were not<br />\nfor the people inside the group,<br />\nthe proposal wouldn't have gotten as far as it has,\" said Yoon.<br />\nYoon suggested that there have<br />\nbeen numerous attempts made in<br />\nthe past to reinstate student radio,<br />\nbut it was not until the carrier current proposal that basic questions<br />\n:were answered and that a definite<br />\n'commitment was made on the<br />\npart of the students. Yoon said,<br />\n\"The administration was receptive once we demonstrated that<br />\nthe students are capable of<br />\nprofessional<br />\nresponsible,<br />\nbehavior.\"<br />\nMira Vayda, vice-president of<br />\nBusiness and Advertising, will be<br />\nconsulting the files from the<br />\nformer student-run station to<br />\ncompile information about potential sponsors. Businesses in the<br />\nCharles Village area, Hopkins<br />\nsports teams, and alumni have<br />\nalready been identified as possible advertising sources.<br />\nThe JHSRC is also considering<br />\nestablishing a policy by which<br />\nDJ's will be required to assist the<br />\nadvertising department. As<br />\nVayda suggested, \"It is<br />\neveryone's responsibility to help<br />\ncover the cost if they want to be<br />\ninvolved.\" Treasurer Andy<br />\nBarnert has suggested other<br />\npublicity ideas, including having<br />\nband concerts and dances on the<br />\nfreshman quad to benefit the<br />\nstation.<br />\nVayda will also be contacting<br />\nrecord companies to have the<br />\nJHSRC placed on their mailing<br />\nlists.

Nine men,<br />\n16 women, and 26 children .vere<br /><br />\n66,000 in 1979.

Although<br />\nAmnesty International had \"no<br />\nspecific information to suggest<br />\nthat any of these 51 people would<br />\nbe at risk of human rights violations in Vietnam,\" the organization was concerned about the<br />\nscreening regulations and other<br />\nimproprieties.<br />\nBeginning with the fall of<br />\nSaigon in April of 1975, Khoa recounted how tens of thousands of<br />\nVietnamese left for the United<br />\nStates. \"At that point about<br />\n125,000 refugees were living in<br />\nthe West.

In addition,<br />\nthose who were given 'interviews' were not exactly interviewed., it was more of a harsh<br />\ninterrogation.

McColl<br />\nI he punchline is this: one man's<br />\nmeat is his castle, or the Andes<br />\nout of anthills.<br />\nAll right. Now you've got your<br />\nplace to live. Presumably you<br />\nwent looking for it with a friend<br />\nor two, and presumably again you<br />\nplan to live with these people.<br />\nCollegiate apartment shoppers<br />\nfall into three categories:<br />\nfreshmen who have lived with<br />\ntheir roommates for a year and<br />\nwant to live with them again,<br />\nfreshmen who have lived with<br />\ntheir roommates for a year and<br />\ndon't want their roommates to<br />\nlive, and upperclassmen who<br />\nthought that they had found the<br />\nideal roommates after killing their<br />\nfreshman year roommates, but<br />\nfound that even their dearest<br />\nfriends are psychopaths.<br />\nI'll suffice it to say that I got<br />\non less than famously with my<br />\nfreshman year roommate. But I<br />\ngot on really well with four other<br />\nfriends of mine, two of whom<br />\nwere dating each other. We all<br />\ngot a rowhouse near 30th and<br />\nAbell. I had my own room, my<br />\nmale roommate had his own<br />\nroom, my female roommate had<br />\nher own room, and the couple<br />\n(hereafter referred to as the Couple) took the master bedroom in<br />\nthe front of the second floor.<br />\nCouples. Couples is a disease,<br />\nlike the flu or the measles. Unlike<br />\nthe flu or measles, however, there<br />\nis no known cure for the Couples.<br />\nThe victim of Couples finds him<br />\nor herself wanting to spend as<br />\nmuch time with their partner that<br />\nthey will use any ploy to do so.<br />\nOne of the first areas Couples infects, therefore, is the larynx,<br />\nwhere it increases the flow of air<br />\nover the vocal cords, making the<br />\nvictim begin to speak in a whiny<br />\nsing-song tone to their partner, as<br />\nin \"G0000000d-by yeeeee\u201e<br />\nh000mxtrinnnneeeeeyyyy, lir 1111<br />\nseeee youuuuu laaaterrrrrrrr.\"<br />\nTypically, the victim can no<br />\nlonger pronounce l's or r's and<br />\nreplaces them with w's. The<br />\nresults are frightening:<br />\n\"I wuv you, my wittew wuvfingie, don't you twy to wun<br />\naway fworn me.\"<br />\nSad, but true. The Couple was<br />\nafflicted with Couples. A typical<br />\nday for myself and my male<br /><br />\nroommate, for example, consisted of: arising at noon, rummaging in the fridge for food,<br />\nmaybe a little racquetball in the<br />\nupstairs hallway, some cable TV,<br />\nand then a full evening's entertainment either drinking to the<br />\npoint of blindness with friends or<br />\nelse going to local alleys and<br />\nstealing carloads of milkcrates<br />\nwith which we would later build<br />\nbed frames.<br />\nThe Couple's typical day consisted of a twelve-course<br />\nbreakfast up in the breakfast nook<br />\nthey had set up in their bedroom<br />\n(no joke, they even called it a<br />\n\"nook\"), some vacuuming, sorting through the catalogs that arrived in the day's mail, a bit more<br />\nvacuuming, maybe going out to<br />\nsee what's new in Tupperware,<br />\nbuying a new attachment for the<br />\nvacuum, later preparing a sauce<br />\nor a dinner that wouldn't be<br />\nfinished for a week, and perhaps<br />\ncanning some preserves in the<br />\nevening. And of course,<br />\nvacuuming.<br />\nWe then realized the next<br />\nsymptom of Couples: obsession<br />\nwith the insignificant. It was this<br />\nvery symptom that led to the<br />\ndownfall of our happy home.<br />\nIt started harmlessly enough.<br />\nOne of the Couples told us that<br />\nwe were being lax in our dishwashing duties. Then they told us<br />\nnot to eat their food anymore, and<br />\nput masking tape on the food that<br />\nas to distinguish<br />\nthey bought<br />\nit from the food that we bought.<br />\nThen they began locking their<br />\nroom. As the days went by, we<br />\nfound more and more tape, now<br />\non the kitchen utensils that we<br />\nwere not allowed to use. At one<br />\npoint, it got so bad they threatened to revoke our knife privileges.<br />\nThe three of us were at a loss.<br />\nIt was around this time that we<br />\n(the non-Couples) coined the<br />\nnicknames for ourselves. Our<br />\nfemale n)ommate, who spread the<br />\nvicious propaganda between us<br />\ntwo non-Couples and the Couple,<br />\nbecame the Antagonizer. Myself<br />\nand my male nxmimates were the<br />\nInconsiderate Bastard Clones.<br />\nThe female Couplet was the<br />\nDemonic Hellwitch, or, if you<br />\nprefer, the DelMonte Hellwitch.<br /><br />\nso<br /><br />\nSee PUNCH,8<br /><br />\nKeep an eye on your investment<br />\nhas demonstrated that it is extremely sensitive to pressure<br />\nfrom parents and alumni. Your child will be receiving a<br />\nfirst-rate education at Johns Hopkins. Keep our far-tooglib administration aware that you will accept nothing less.<br /><br />\nWith the c.mpus crawling with prospective freshmen,<br />\nwe find ourse;,,es torn. While we are proud of Johns<br />\nHopkins, the Administration's conduct over the past two<br />\nyears has left us with serious doubts about the University's commitment to its Arts and Sciences. The publication last week of the course listings for next semester has<br />\nonly served to increase our anxiety.<br />\nAlthough there will be yet another 800-plus person<br />\nfreshman class gracing our lvwns come September\u2014part<br />\nof a University initiative to increase enrollment here by<br />\nten percent\u2014 there will be fewer courses offered than were<br />\navailable this past term. This dearth of coursework is due<br />\nin part to faculty sabbaticals, retirements, and the like. This<br />\nis not unusual or especially worrisome. It is also partly<br />\ndue to protracted faculty searches, whose paucity can be<br />\nattributed to the Five Year Plan's austerity.<br />\nThe problem is that the number of courses offered in<br />\nthe Humanities for fall term is exactly the same as was<br />\navailable during the fall of 1986. At that time, there were<br />\nover a hundred fewer freshmen entering our tiny University. While introductory classes, which often have sections,<br />\ncan more easily adapt to the larger enrolment, problems<br />\narise with smaller upper-level classes. More and more<br />\noften, once-small seminars have been overwhelmed and<br />\nturned into semi-lectures, or, less frequently, students are<br />\nsimply closed out of classes they need. Only one more<br />\nupper-level Humanities class is available this year than at<br />\nthe corresponding time four years ago.<br />\nThe number of upper-level Natural Science courses has<br />\nactually fallen eighteen percent from fall term 1986. If you<br />\nwant to know the effect that this is having on<br />\nundergraduates, ask any science major. They will almost<br />\ncertainly be able to elaborate further than we have. The<br />\ncrunch is moving at a somewhat slower pace through the<br />\nHumanities, but it is every bit as real.<br />\nIf you are a prospective freshman or a parent of a<br />\nfreshman, bear two things in mind. For all of Hopkins's<br />\ncurrent difficulties, it remains unique among private<br />\nAmerican universities: almost all classes here are taught<br />\nby tenure-track professors, with few exceptions. Your<br />\nchildren will rarely be taught by graduate students or temporary faculty. This is not true at almost any of of the nation's most prestigious schools. What is important,<br />\nhowever, is that you remain in close touch with events at<br />\nthe University. The (outgoipig, mercifully) administration<br /><br />\nCrime on the rise<br />\nAfter a look in this week's news section, many of you<br />\nwill think twice about walking alone to the local convenience store when a munchie attack strikes at midnight.<br />\nYou should also think twice, however, about running down<br />\nthe hallway to brush your teeth and leaving your dorm<br />\nroom unlocked.<br />\nA series of muggings and break-ins has occurred in<br />\nCharles Village this year and unfortunately no one, male<br />\nor female, student or professional, is exempt from being<br />\na potential victim. The secure and idyllic appearance of<br />\nthe Homewood campus makes it easy to forget that crime<br />\ndoes in fact pass through its gates. Baltimore is a highcrime city, and theives seem to be taking quite a liking<br />\nto Hopkins. For example, this week's campus crime report<br />\nfrom the Security Office listed four separate incidents of<br />\nwallets having been lifted from dorm rooms. All the rooms<br />\nhad been left unattended and unlocked. In some of the<br />\ncases, however, it took only seconds for the thief to gain<br />\naccess, take what was wanted, and leave.<br />\nOn a more dangerous note, a Hopkins student was apparently mugged last night, adding to the total number of<br />\nstudents who have found themselves in such a situation<br />\nduring the past few weeks. Although these incidents occurred off campus, they happened in areas frequented by<br />\nstudents. According to the police, extra patrols and<br />\nplainclothes officers have been assigned to the Charles<br />\nVillage area, but students need to assume responsibility<br />\nfor their safety as well. Walking in groups is a good way<br />\nto deter a potential mugger\u2014and is advocated by the<br />\npolice\u2014and the Hopkins security shuttle is available after<br />\n5 p.m..<br />\nThe News-Letter also thinks that it should go without<br />\nsaying that everyone should lock their door, whether its<br />\nto a dorm room, an apartment, an office, or a second-hand<br />\nBuick, even if they will only be gone \"a minute or two.\"<br />\nAfter all, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.<br />\nIt also might save you a few bucks and a lot of grief.<br /><br />\ninns,<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nRadio station<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs your article in today's issue<br />\nwill tell, Johns Hopkins will soon<br />\nbe ending its experiment with<br />\nnon-student radio.

I was awakened by<br />\nmy phone ringing. Since my<br />\nfriends and relatives know not to<br />\ncall me at that hour, I hoped it<br />\nwas for my housemate and decided to let my answering machine<br />\ntake the call. I figured that if it<br />\nwas an emergency I could still get<br />\nup. When my message was<br />\nthrough, I listened to see if I<br />\nrecognized the voice. What I<br />\nheard was several drunk men,<br />\nwho yelled,<br />\nYou fucking<br />\ncocksucker! We hope you die!\"<br />\nI can only assume that the<br />\nmessage was aimed at me, by<br />\npeople who know me to be the<br />\nvice-president of the Gay and<br />\nLesbian Alliance.<br />\nOver the past few weeks, letters to the editor have featured<br />\ntwo cases of sexual harassment on<br />\nHomewood Campus. Like my<br />\nphone message, both were verbal, and neither caused physical<br />\nharm. Many people would be<br />\nprone to discard these incidents<br />\nas unrelated, more-or-less<br />\nbelieving that they are symptomatic only of isolated jerks. We<br />\nmust resist this temptation. Verbal assaults, whether against<br />\nwomen, gays, or racial or ethnic<br />\nminorities are more than just<br />\nupsetting\u2014they are directly linked to the physical assaults these<br />\ngroups suffer, and create the atmosphere of fear and hatred that<br />\nkeep people from enjoying their<br />\nfull capacities for achievement<br />\nand freedom.<br />\nThe first step in oppression of<br />\nany form is the dehumanizing of<br />\nthe victim in the oppressor's<br />\nmind. This justifies both the<br />\nhatred and the use of violence.<br />\nFour men reduced Ms. Stephan<br />\nto her body parts by yelling<br />\n\"Look at them tithes!\" When she<br />\nlooked shocked they laughed\u2014<br />\nafter all, what right does a pair<br />\nof breasts have to respect?<br />\nMs. Vaidhyanathan was reduc<br />\ned to \"her\" race, when a man<br />\nyelled, \"I'm gonna fuck you all<br />\nthe way back to Korea!'.''(4ic --she's Indian.) This tactic is identical to that used by whites to<br />\njustify slavery and segregation in<br />\nAmerica, and is used today by<br />\nwhite South Africans.<br />\nI was reduced to an act, rather<br />\nthan a race or body part. From<br />\nmy position in GALA, the men<br />\nwho called me deduced, not that<br />\nI suck cocks, but that I am a<br />\ncocksucker. In their minds I am<br />\nno longer human, hut a thing, a<br />\ncocksucker. Thus, it is quite<br />\nnatural that they should wish me<br />\ndead, that I stop masquerading<br />\n(and perhaps corrupting) decent<br />\nhumans.<br />\nIn these cases, the assualt ended shortly after the dehumanizing<br />\nprocess. As I said, all of the<br />\nassualts were purely verbal.<br />\nHowever, these verbal assaults<br />\nare typical of assaults that become<br />\nphysical. Rape is a daily reality<br />\nin the lives of women, as is<br />\n\"queer-bashing\" in the lives of<br />\ngays, lesbians, and bisexuals. The<br />\nline between a threat of rape<br />\n(\"I'm going to fuck you.\") and<br />\nrape or between a death-wish<br />\n(\"We hope you die!\") and a<br />\nqueer-bashing is very thin. And<br />\n. even when there is no violence,<br />\nthe effects are often very damaging. Ms. Vaidhyanathan was terrified, and her fear lasted long<br />\npast reaching Shaffer Hall. Both<br />\nshe and Ms. Stephan told me that<br />\ntheir feelings about walking on<br />\nour campus are permanently<br />\nchanged. Mine is too.<br />\nIt is no coincidence that these<br />\nassaults were all committed by<br />\nmen. Men, particularly straight<br />\nmen, commit over 90 percent of<br />\nthe violence in America, often<br />\nwith numbers and alcohol to<br />\nbolster their courage and<br />\nrighteousness. What we must<br />\nrealize about these men in particular is that they are not uniquely deranged people that none of<br />\nus has ever met. Rather, they are<br />\nour classmates. Each of these<br />\nmen, with the possible (but highly<br />\ndoubtful) exception of my callers,<br />\nwere Hopkins students, part of<br />\nour community. They are common students we see everywhere.<br />\nWomen don't ask for walks and<br />\nrides home because they're afraid<br />\nthey might meet one of these<br />\nrapists in Baltimore, just as gays,<br />\nlesbians, and bisexuals don't stay<br />\n\"closeted\" because of a dozen<br /><br />\nfanatics with baseball bats. The<br />\nrapists and the queer-bashers, like<br />\nthose who limit themselves to<br />\nverbal assualts, are far more common than we might care to<br />\nbelieve. More importantly, in<br />\nterms of how we can go about<br />\nsolving this problem, their<br />\nbehavior is encouraged and enforced every time we do nothing<br />\nabout it. Every time we laugh, or<br />\nstay silent, when a sexist or racist<br />\njoke is told, or tell one ourselves,<br />\nwe are sending the message that<br />\nwe approve, that women and persons of color are not human.<br />\nEvery time someone uses a word<br />\nlike \"queer\" or \"fag\" or<br />\n\"slope\" or \"cunt\" to describe<br />\nsomeone and we say nothing, we<br />\nare approving. To refuse to act is<br />\nto act.<br />\nAt the risk of an irrelevant<br />\ndigression, I would like to end by<br />\naddressing the men who called<br />\nme. I do not know who you are,<br />\nor why you feel threatened by<br />\nme. It may be that some of you<br />\nhave a real cause to dislike me<br />\nSee Ellis, 8<br /><br />\nticket price of $4.00 will include<br />\nhot dogs, the traditional roast<br />\npigs, and soda, as well as eight<br />\nuniversity (I am not aware of one) hours of live music.

The war had begun.<br />\nWe should have seen the attacks coming, although the<br />\nfighting broke out in the Couple's<br />\ncamp. It began one day when<br />\nSpineless was doing the Couple's<br />\nlaundry and he thoughtlessly<br />\nthrew DelMonte's sweater into<br />\nthe dryer with the rest of his<br />\nacrylic ones. DelMonte came<br />\nhome, and then, and THEN,<br />\nAND THEN\u2014she saw HER<br />\nSWEATER\"<br />\n\"Spineless!!!!\" she bellowed,<br />\nYOU<br />\nHAVE<br />\n\"WHAT<br />\nDONE??? YOU SHRANK MY<br />\nWOOL SWEATER!!!! YOU<br />\nWILL SUFFER FOR THIS,<br />\nMORTAL!!\" and poor Spineless<br />\nwas wrapped in the flames of hell<br />\nand dragged into their bedroom.<br />\nThis became known in our<br />\nhouse as the Great Sweater<br />\nDebate.<br />\nWhat us three military minds<br />\ndidn't realize was that this battle<br />\nwas merely a diversionary tactic,<br />\nand the Couple had been in conference arranging alliance talks.<br />\nThe reason we missed these talks<br />\nwas that we two Bastard Clones<br />\nhad gone to the other Clone's<br />\nhouse for a weekend, largely to<br />\nclean out his parents' pantry. We<br />\nfound probably the world's<br />\nlargest supply of Hickory Farms<br />\nCheese and Cracker Spread<br />\nAssortments that people send as<br />\ngifts when they can't think of<br />\nanything else, and being as I am<br />\nthe world's biggest fan of those<br />\nlittle beefsticks that you get in<br />\nsuch assortments, we took them<br />\nall back to school with us, along<br />\nwith some deviled ham and a couple of Spams. Call it rations for<br />\nthe troops.<br />\nIn our absence, the Antagonizer had taken quite a liking<br />\nto cinnamon toast, and had begun<br />\neating it two, three, four times a<br />\nday. In fact, when we returned,<br />\nwhile us Clones put away our<br />\nbeefsticks, the Antagonizer fretted over the fact that the lid to her<br />\ncinnamon container had become<br />\nunhinged, and she had to fix it<br /><br />\nwith masking tape.<br />\nOne day, of course, the<br />\nbeefsticks were gone. I was away<br />\nweeping, and the other Clone<br />\nwent into the kitchen to have the<br />\nAntagonizer teach him the art of<br />\nmaking cinnamon toast in order<br />\nthat he might be able to maintain<br />\nhis strength during wartime.<br />\nThe Couple seized upon this<br />\nmoment of military weakness,<br />\nand Spineless stormed into the<br />\nkitchen, where the Antagonizer<br />\nhad just picked up the cinnamon.<br />\n\"That's ours, you know,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"We bought it. You're<br />\neating our food.\"<br />\nIt turned out that the neutral<br />\nsupply of cinnamon had been used up long ago in one of<br />\nDelMonte's dinner masterpieces.<br />\nShe had had to go out and buy a<br />\nnew supply. The masking tape<br />\nthat had appeared on the container was our clue to HANDS<br />\nOFF, not a repair on the hinge.<br />\nWell, being caught in this warcrime as they were, after<br />\nSpineless left the field, the Antagonizer graciously left two<br />\nnickels on the container of cinnamon to pay for the supply that<br />\nshe had filched. The field was<br />\nempty.<br />\nLater, upon my return from<br />\nweeping, I went into the kitchen<br />\nto feed my sorrow. I opened the<br />\nsome<br />\nmoved<br />\nfridge,<br />\nand\u2014<br />\naround,<br />\nstuff<br />\nwhat was this? There was! There<br />\nwas!! There was one beefstick<br />\nleft! Huzzah!! I danced into the<br />\nstreet as I polished off the<br />\nmanufactured meat by-products.<br />\nLater, the Clone and the Antagonizer returned to the kitchen<br />\nto find something to eat in the<br />\nstead of the cinnamon toast that<br />\nthey so dearly craved. Finding<br />\nnothing tapeless, they sat and<br />\nsulked.<br />\nSpineless marched in determinedly to the fridge, preparing<br />\nto extricate and devour the<br />\nHickory Farms beefstick that had<br />\narrived in the mail from his<br />\nmother only that morning as an<br />\nEaster present. To his utter hor-<br /><br />\nror, the Cheese and Cracker<br />\nSpread Assortment was there, but<br />\nwhere there should have been a<br />\nplastic-wrapped delight, there<br />\nwas merely an indentation in the<br />\ngreen plastic grass.<br />\nMY<br />\nATE<br />\n\"WHO<br />\nBEEFSTICK?\" he cried, turning<br />\nand glaring at the Clone and the<br />\nAntagonizer. The Clone said<br />\nnothing.

Charles Dove, of the English<br />\nDept., requested $486 for a series<br />\nof short, experimental films,<br />\nmostly from the '60s. $500 was<br />\ngranted.<br />\nb. Two representatives, Andrew Bragen and Jeff Pruzan,<br />\nfrom Lemniscate, a campus<br />\nliterary publication, came armed<br />\nwith a revised budget request: this<br />\ntime for $650, down from the<br />\n$1000 they asked for before. The<br />\nSAC will provide about that<br />\namount, too. After some debate,<br />\n$500 was granted.<br />\nc. Alan Keenan and Amy<br />\nWygant requested that money be<br />\nset aside for a symposium to be<br />\nheld next fall to celebrate a conference that was held at Hopkins<br />\n25 years ago, considered at the<br />\ntime to have been a milestone in<br />\nthe development of literary<br />\nstudies. The cost would be at least<br />\n$4500. Seeing as how only $3500<br />\nis left in this year's symposium<br />\nbudget (which can be rolled<br />\nover), this would have meant<br />\ncommitting money from next<br />\nyear's budget. not yet appropriated. The discussion was<br />\ncomplicated further by the fact of<br /><br />\nanother symposium request.<br />\nd. Some students from the<br />\nHispanic and Italian Studies<br />\nDept., spoken for principally by<br />\nJulia Hairston, wished to know<br />\nhow to go about making a funding<br />\nrequest for a symposium on<br />\nWomen's Studies in Italian<br />\nStudies, to be held this Nov. This<br />\nwould need at least $5000,<br />\nthough not all of this was expected to come from the GRO.<br />\nThe debate then focussed primarily on whether it is right for the<br />\noutgoing GRO council to pledge<br />\nnot-yet appropriated money on<br />\nbehalf of a still as-yet unelected<br />\n1990-91 GRO council. GRO Cochair Joanne Houlihan and<br />\nSecretary Munro suggested that<br />\nthe GRO might make it policy as<br />\nof now to have the first act of the<br />\nnew council (or at least new<br />\ncouncil officers, the members remaining in their posts till Sept.)<br />\nbe to decide upon symposium<br />\nfunding for the following year. (It<br />\nwas agreed by all that it was<br />\nreasonable to decide these matters<br />\na year before the actual symposium because they take so long<br />\nto organize.) The matter was<br />\nresolved by requesting the<br />\nfunding-requesters to resubmit on<br />\n4 May, by which time the new<br />\nGRO officers will have been<br />\nelected.<br />\nGRO HANDBOOK<br />\nThe GRO handbook, Living in<br />\nBaltimore, will be revised this<br />\nsummer and reissued in the fall.<br />\nThe book was last released in the<br />\nfall of 1988.

The Jays had their share of<br />\npossesion time, but could not<br />\ncreate quality shots.<br />\nThat changed when junior<br />\nhome Kara Tipton rifled in a<br />\nbounce shot from 10 yards out at<br />\n18:31 to make it 3-1.

The win<br />\nover Haverford was especially<br />\nsignificant, as Hopkins hasn't<br />\ndefeated them since 1987.<br />\n\"Beating Haverford was a big<br />\nwin,\" head coach Bill Nelson<br />\ncommented. \"They're one of the<br />\ntop teams in the region.\"<br />\nRyu Iwai lost to Haverford's<br />\nfirst singles player 1-6, 3-6, and<br />\nBill Braude fell at #4, 4-6, 7-6,<br />\n2-6, but Hopkins won all of the<br />\nother singles matches to take a<br />\n4-2 lead going into the doubles.<br />\nLorin Engquist won by the<br />\nunusual score of 0-6, 6-2, 6-4 in<br />\nsecond singles. His opponent was<br />\na serve-and-volley player with a<br />\nbig serve, and Engquist benefited<br />\nnoticeably when the tennis balls<br />\nstarted going dead. Haverford's<br />\nplayer requested new balls at the<br />\nstart of the third set, which is the<br />\ncustom at some schools.<br />\nHowever, the home team<br />\nmakes those decisions, and<br />\nHopkins does not provide a new<br />\ncan of balls.<br />\nTed Roth won at third singles,<br />\n7-5, 6-1, employing a power<br />\nbaseline game. Roth is known for<br />\nhis big forehand, but seems reluctant to come into the net to take<br />\nadvantage of opponents' weak<br />\nreturns. As a result he has to hit<br />\nseveral good shots in a row to win<br />\neach point.<br />\nLuckily for Hopkins, he was<br />\nable to do that against Haverford.<br />\n\"I feel it's necessary to hit as<br />\nmany forehands as possible as<br />\nhard as possible,\" Roth said,<br />\ndescribing his barbarian-like tactics. \"I like to bring people into<br />\nnet and then peg them.\"<br />\nSam Kim, who seems to have<br />\nthree-set marathons every match<br />\nhe plays, came through for<br />\nHopkins at the #5 slot, winniag<br />\n4-6, 6-0, 7-5. Mike Kim edged<br />\nhis opponent 6-4, 7-5.<br />\nIn the doubles, Hopkins<br />\nbrought in their doubles<br />\nspecialists, Jon Missner and<br />\nFrancois Erasmus. Missner team-<br /><br />\ned with Braude at second doubles<br />\nto clinch the match for Hopkins<br />\nwith a 6-2, 7-6 win in a controversial match.<br />\nWith Hopkins up 5-2 in the second set, Missner and Braude accused the Haverford team of<br />\ncheating on consecutive points.<br />\nAn argument ensued, but the calls<br />\nstood and Haverford came back<br />\nto tie the set at 5-5 before<br />\nHopkins won in a tiebreak. \"I'm<br />\nglad we won because they were<br />\ncheating and heckling us,\"<br />\nMissner said after the match.<br />\n..Ermmus and Kim teamed up to<br />\nwin at third doubles, 1-6, 7-6,<br />\n7-6, and Engquist and lwai lost<br />\nat #1 7-5, 1-6, 6-7 to account for<br />\nthe final 6-3 margin.<br />\nThe day before, Hopkins<br />\ndefeated an overmatched Ursinus<br />\nteam 6-3.<br />\nThe team fell to Washington on<br />\nMonday, 9-0, as expected.<br />\nWashington recruits players from<br />\nall over the world, including<br />\nSouth Africa and Spain, and<br />\nseems to retain them year after<br />\nyear.<br />\nIwai, at #1, and Missner, playing at #6, were the only players<br />\nto win more than three games<br />\ntotal in the singles. Missner and<br />\nBraude fell 7-5, 7-5 at second<br />\ndoubles, which was Hopkins'<br />\nclosest loss on the day.<br />\nCoach Nelson is more than<br />\nsatisfied with the team's performance so far. \"I'm ecstatic,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"The impressive thing<br />\nabout our team is the guys at the<br />\nbottom are really competitors.<br />\nWe can go eight deep this year.\"<br />\nIndeed, when Hopkins has its<br />\nfull lineup, its number four<br />\nthrough six players (Sam Kim,<br />\nMike Kim, and either Braude or<br />\nRoth) are a combined 11-1 on the<br />\nseason. Hopkins also has an<br />\nedge over most teams in doubles<br />\nbecause of Missner and Erasmus.<br />\n\"The last few matches will depend upon our doubles<br />\nspecialists, Jon Missner and<br />\nFrancois, who have been playing<br />\nespecially well,\" predicted senior<br />\ncaptain lwai. Hopkins closes<br />\nout the season with three very<br />\nhard matches, against Dickinsor<br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall (Friday a<br />\n3:00 p.m. at Hopkins), and<br />\nGettysburg.<br /><br />\nMen's track places four<br />\nTRACK, from 16<br />\nboth the distance and sprint teams<br />\nare steadily improving, adding to<br />\nthe confidence level of the team<br />\ngoing into the meet. Sophomore<br />\nJohn Robinson has already<br />\nqualified for the MAC's in both<br />\nthe 15(X) meter and the 3000<br />\nsteeplechase and is expected to<br />\nperform well.<br />\nAfter the next meet at<br />\nHomewood, the team travels to<br />\nMessiah for a tri-meet against<br /><br />\nMessiah and Swarthmore. Both<br />\nare strong squads and the Jays<br />\nhope to be in full stride by the<br />\ntime this meet arrives. Also, the<br />\nMAC's are only three weeks<br />\naway, which starts to add a little<br />\npressure to those who have not<br />\nalready qualified. Coach Garner<br />\nstated, \"Right now we have five<br />\npeople qualified for the MAC's,<br />\nbut I feel this is a good number<br />\nof people who need just a little<br />\nmore work and they will he there,<br />\ntoo.''<br /><br />\nby Paul Kang<br />\nHopkins rugby rebounded from<br />\na 16-15 loss to thrash St. Mary's<br />\nCollege 57-4. Hopkins seemed<br />\npumped from the start as they<br />\njumped to a quick 18-0 lid in the<br />\nfirst 20 minutes of the game.<br />\nScores were posted by Brad<br />\nErikson, Jim Gomez; and Phil<br />\nSmith. Five minutes before the<br />\nend of the half, Smith made a<br />\nbehind-the-head pass to an open<br />\nTurfman Cena, who rumbled in<br />\nfor the score.<br />\nThe second half' provided no<br />\ndrop in intensity for Hopkins, as<br />\nthey scored at will against a larger<br />\nand faster team. Dietrich Schultz<br />\nalone made a hat trick with 15<br />\nminutes left in the game. His<br />\nspectacular off-balance shot past<br />\nthe goalie made the score 37-0,<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nWith two minutes left in the<br />\ngame, Hopkins was on the verge<br />\nof their third shutout, but one of<br />\nSt. Mary's props sidestepped a<br />\nJoe McCullough tackle and<br />\noutraced him to the end zone.

I think it<br />\nwas a huge success,\" said<br />\nwomen's captain Kim Roberts.<br />\nAlthough racing conditions on<br />\nthe 2000-meter course were excellent for the morning heats,<br />\nstrong winds forced Coach Perry<br />\nto call off six final events in the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nThe Hopkins women's varsity<br />\nteam made a good showing at<br />\ntheir own regatta. The<br />\nlightweight eight pulled a secondplace 8:00.73 to George<br />\nWashington University's 7:37.11<br />\nin the finals of their event. The<br />\nheavyweight four paddled to an<br />\neasy first-place finish in their<br />\nheat, with a time that indicated<br />\nprobable victory in their cancelled<br />\nfinal.<br />\nSimilarly,<br />\nthe<br />\nmen's<br />\nheavyweight four led their heat<br />\nand was a favorite to win their<br />\nevent. The men's lightweight four<br />\nbrought home a third-place<br />\noverall behind boats from Pittsburgh and Stockton State. In the<br />\nfastest heat of the men's novice<br />\neight race, Hopkins finished a<br />\nrespectable third and gained<br /><br />\nvaluable racing experience which<br />\nwill undoubtedly contribute to<br />\nthis promising young boat's<br />\nfuture success.<br />\nIn more intensive competition<br />\nat the George Wa ington Invitational Regatta on the Potomac<br />\nRiver, Hopkins crews rowed<br />\nagainst schools such as<br />\nGeorgetown, Temple, George<br />\nWashington, George Mason, the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia, and the<br />\ntraditional rowing powerhouse of<br />\nthe Naval Academy. Despite<br />\nchoppy water conditions, the varsity women's four remained<br />\nundefeated, finishing with an<br />\n8:32 and several boatlengths of<br />\nopen water over second-place<br />\nNavy at 8:58 and Georgetown at<br />\n9:30. Three-seat Ingeborg Schlate<br />\nwas happy with the win but \"had<br />\nhoped for a tougher race.\" We're<br />\nlooking forward to a more competitive race next weekend at the<br />\nLa Salle Invitational in Camden,<br />\nNew Jersey.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins men's heavy four<br />\nalso conquered the rough water<br />\nand opposing crews. They edged out Navy by five seconds, earning the right to enjoy a couple<br />\nof traditional crew rituals. They<br />\ncollected racing shirts from each<br />\nof the teams in their final event<br />\n(George<br />\nWashington,<br />\nGeorgetown, and Navy)and tossed coxswain E.K.

If we could get<br />\na little school spirit going, it<br />\nmight work. There is a need for<br />\na place for students to hang out.<br />\n\"It's a fine institution. I'm<br />\npleased as I've learned lots and<br />\nhave gotten everything I wanted<br />\nout of my education. At this<br />\npoint, I don't know what's ahead.<br />\nI'm sad to be graduating.

My contribution was<br />\nsmall as a freshman, but winning<br />\nas a team is a lot more important,<br />\neven to those guys. I recognize<br />\nthat more now than I did then.<br />\nWinning a national championship<br />\nmeans more than any individual<br />\nperformance.\"<br />\nJay grew up in Baltimore and<br />\nfollowed the lacrosse team<br />\nthrough high school. When it<br />\ncame time for him to choose a<br />\ncollege, Hopkins was an easy<br />\nchoice. \"I knew what the school<br />\nand its lacrosse was all about. If<br />\nI had a choice to do it over again,<br />\nI'd still come to Hopkins.\"<br />\nTo be competitive in any collegiate sport, it is necessary to do<br />\na good job of recruiting. To Jay,<br />\n\"it is the biggest aspect of any<br />\nprogram because if you don't<br />\nhave the players, I don't think<br />\nyou'll win it all, no matter how<br />\ngood the coach is.<br />\n\"In years past, the best players<br />\nalways came to Hopkins. Back<br />\nthen, there weren't so many good<br />\nplayers and the game wasn't as<br />\nspread out. Now, there are both<br />\ngood coaches and players all over<br />\nthe East coast. The competition<br />\nis tougher. Hopkins still gets<br />\ngreat players, but other teams are<br />\ngetting them too. Overall, it<br />\nmakes for a better game.\"<br />\nThis season has been tough for<br />\nthe team as they have had to deal<br />\nwith a four-game losing streak.<br />\n\"It's been a new experience for<br />\nall of us. The coaching staff<br />\nalways does a great job, but they<br />\ndidn't know how to deal with it,<br />\njust as the team didn't know.<br />\nWe've both learned from it\u2014it's<br /><br />\nbeen a different year for a!l of us<br />\nas we've all had to make a lot of<br />\nadjustments. They'll be better<br />\ncoaches for it in the long run.<br />\n\"At this point, our backs are<br />\nagainst the wall. We have to win<br />\nthe rest of our games. It's a new<br />\nseason once you get to the<br />\nplayoffs. Right now, Saturday's<br />\nthe most important game of the<br />\nseason. We can't even think<br />\nabout the post-season yet.<br />\n\"A lot of talented freshmen<br />\nhave had to do a lot this year due<br />\nto the large number of seniors that<br />\ngraduated last season. Still, we<br />\ngraduate great seniors every year<br />\nbecause we always have a good<br />\nteam. You can't expect us to fold<br />\nthe next year after a large number<br />\nof seniors have graduated. We<br />\ndon't believe in rebuilding years<br />\nas we should have the players<br />\ncoming up who can fill the gaps.<br />\n'We have the toughest<br />\nschedule in the nation so every<br />\nyear is tough.

But starting next fall,<br />\nthere'll be guys who'll start to<br />\nplay better and will fill the gaps<br />\nleft by graduation. That's what<br />\nHopkins lacrosse is all about: the<br />\nbest players rising up to do the<br />\njob.<br />\n\"This year is probably my best<br />\nso far. I've scored more in one<br />\nseason than in the past three years<br />\nand am contributing more in<br />\nevery game. It's been fun, but I'd<br />\nrather be winning more.\"<br />\nAs much as Jay is into athletics,<br />\nhe realizes the importance of<br />\nacademics. \"I didn't really<br />\nmature until my junior year. I<br />\nreally started to, concentrate on<br />\nmy academics more as I found<br />\nout how important they were. My<br />\ngrades have show that change. If<br />\nyou work hard and apply<br />\nyourself, you shouldn't have<br />\nmany problems.<br />\n\"My major is wide open as you<br />\ncan take a lot of classes in both<br />\nthe day and night school.
