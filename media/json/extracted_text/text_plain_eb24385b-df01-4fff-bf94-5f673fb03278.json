To join Signa Phi Nothing<br />\nand get this hideous membership pin absolutely free, simply<br />\ntake a pair of scissors and cut out the illustration and paste it<br />\nto your dickey.<br />\nLet me hasten to state that I do not recommend your joining<br />\nSigna Phi Nothing. The only thing I recommend in this column<br />\nis Marlboro cigarettes, as any honest man would who likes a<br />\nfiltered cigarette with an unfiltered taste, who yearns to settle<br />\nback and enjoy a full-flavored smoke, whose heart is quickened<br />\nby a choice of soft pack or flip-top box and who gets paid every<br />\nweek for writing this column.<br />\nIt is difficult to think of any reason why you should join<br />\nSigna Phi Nothing. Some people, of course, are joiners by<br />\nnature; if you are one such I must tell you there are any number<br />\nof better organizations than Signa Phi Nothing for you to join\u2014<br />\nthe Mafia, for example.<br />\nBut if you should join Signa Phi Nothing, let me give you<br />\nseveral warnings. First off, it is the only fraternity that admits<br />\ngirls. Second, there is no pledge period; each new member immediately goes active. Perhap \"inactive\" is a more accurate<br />\nterm; there are no meetings, no drives, no campaigns, no sports,<br />\nno games, no dues, no grip, and no house.<br />\nThe only thing Signa Phi Nothing has that other fraternities<br />\nhave is a fraternity hymn. In fact, two hymns were submitted<br />\n<br />\nBy CHUCK NATHAN<br />\nThe \"New Frontier\" is here<br />\nand it has been for just one<br />\nmonth. In that short period of<br />\ntime several things have become<br />\nquite evident.<br />\nFirst of all it is patently obvious that there will not be a<br />\n\"Hundred Days\" like Roosevelt's.<br />\nMoreover, there will never be<br />\nanother such period until we<br />\nhave a depression or similar<br />\ncrisis as severe as that which<br />\nRoosevelt faced when he took<br />\noffice.<br />\nAs a matter of fact it is quite<br />\npossible that the much heralded<br />\n\"New Frontier\" will soon consist only of periodic tours by<br />\ndignitaries<br />\nthrough<br />\nAmerica<br />\nvisiting various forms of \"troubled areas,\" pictures of the<br />\nvisiting dignitary, promises of<br />\nsweeping legislation, and a bill<br />\nin congress blocked by the conservative element.<br />\nFrontier of Fashion<br />\nAnd accompanying this business half of the \"New Frontier\"<br />\nwill be the fashion half of the<br />\nfrontier, e.g. Jacqueline Kennedy, wearing a mink coat,<br />\nwhich has been dyed to look like<br />\na cloth coat, attending the national convention of the Beauticians of America, and speaking<br />\non why she recently switched from the long renowned \"bubbled cut\" to the new \"birdnest<br />\ncut.\" Following such an appearance the women of America<br />\n<br />\nwill scurry to the department<br />\nstore, to the shoe store, to the<br />\ndress store, and to the beauty<br />\nparlor, and overnight we will<br />\nhave 25 million poor facsimiles<br />\nof the stylish first lady.<br />\nThe reasons for such a political .degeneration lie in the very<br />\nnature of the American two<br />\nparty system. Once upon a time,<br />\nas. everybody knows, the Republicans were a homogenous party<br />\nand the Democrats were a homogeneous party. Then years passed and time and change slowly<br />\nresulted in the utter collapse of<br />\nthe political party as it was<br />\noriginally conceived. Now neither<br />\nparty can claim to represent a<br />\nsingle unified political ideology.<br />\nBut Americans, like their<br />\nBritish counterparts, cherish<br />\ntradition, if only secretly. Thus<br />\na Republican like Rockerfeller<br />\nbelongs to the same national<br />\nparty as Barry Goldwater of<br />\nArizona. And Paul Douglas of<br />\nIllinois in name belongs to the<br />\nsame Democratic Party as James<br />\n0. Eastland of Mississippi.<br />\nTime for Change<br />\nIt is about time that both<br />\nparties faced reality. After years<br />\nof pretending there were no<br />\nsplits in either party, after<br />\nyears of convention activity to<br />\nhide existing splits, after years<br />\nof frustrated battle by both factions, it should now be apparent<br />\nthat America itself can no longer bury its collective head in<br />\n<br />\nWaverly Laundromat<br />\n3330 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nDaily 8 A.M. to 6 P.M.<br />\nMon., Thurs., Fri.

In<br />\n1933, when Roosevelt came into<br />\noffice, he had the support of the<br />\nsame coalition Kennedy must<br />\nnow depend upon. In fact, it was<br />\nRoosevelt who created the union of the ' Southern Democrat<br />\nand the Northern Cities which<br />\nhas become the victorious Democratic party of 1961.

In the intervening 35<br />\nyears the South has discovered<br />\na new ally, the arch conservative wing of the Republican<br />\nparty. And this coalition is not<br />\nonly strong, but it also has the<br />\nadvantage of sharing much the<br />\nsame ideology. If Kennedy is to<br />\naccomplish his program he must<br />\ndo so without and despite the<br />\nSouth, or he must find some way<br />\nto force the South into line.

To join Signa Phi Nothing<br />\nand get this hideous membership pin absolutely free, simply<br />\ntake a pair of scissors and cut out the illustration and paste it<br />\nto your dickey.<br />\nLet me hasten to state that I do not recommend your joining<br />\nSigna Phi Nothing. The only thing I recommend in this column<br />\nis Marlboro cigarettes, as any honest man would who likes a<br />\nfiltered cigarette with an unfiltered taste, who yearns to settle<br />\nback and enjoy a full-flavored smoke, whose heart is quickened<br />\nby a choice of soft pack or flip-top box and who gets paid every<br />\nweek for writing this column.<br />\nIt is difficult to think of any reason why you should join<br />\nSigna Phi Nothing. Some people, of course, are joiners by<br />\nnature; if you are one such I must tell you there are any number<br />\nof better organizations than Signa Phi Nothing for you to join\u2014<br />\nthe Mafia, for example.<br />\nBut if you should join Signa Phi Nothing, let me give you<br />\nseveral warnings. First off, it is the only fraternity that admits<br />\ngirls. Second, there is no pledge period; each new member immediately goes active. Perhap \"inactive\" is a more accurate<br />\nterm; there are no meetings, no drives, no campaigns, no sports,<br />\nno games, no dues, no grip, and no house.<br />\nThe only thing Signa Phi Nothing has that other fraternities<br />\nhave is a fraternity hymn. In fact, two hymns were submitted<br /><br />\nBy CHUCK NATHAN<br />\nThe \"New Frontier\" is here<br />\nand it has been for just one<br />\nmonth. In that short period of<br />\ntime several things have become<br />\nquite evident.<br />\nFirst of all it is patently obvious that there will not be a<br />\n\"Hundred Days\" like Roosevelt's.<br />\nMoreover, there will never be<br />\nanother such period until we<br />\nhave a depression or similar<br />\ncrisis as severe as that which<br />\nRoosevelt faced when he took<br />\noffice.<br />\nAs a matter of fact it is quite<br />\npossible that the much heralded<br />\n\"New Frontier\" will soon consist only of periodic tours by<br />\ndignitaries<br />\nthrough<br />\nAmerica<br />\nvisiting various forms of \"troubled areas,\" pictures of the<br />\nvisiting dignitary, promises of<br />\nsweeping legislation, and a bill<br />\nin congress blocked by the conservative element.<br />\nFrontier of Fashion<br />\nAnd accompanying this business half of the \"New Frontier\"<br />\nwill be the fashion half of the<br />\nfrontier, e.g. Jacqueline Kennedy, wearing a mink coat,<br />\nwhich has been dyed to look like<br />\na cloth coat, attending the national convention of the Beauticians of America, and speaking<br />\non why she recently switched from the long renowned \"bubbled cut\" to the new \"birdnest<br />\ncut.\" Following such an appearance the women of America<br /><br />\nwill scurry to the department<br />\nstore, to the shoe store, to the<br />\ndress store, and to the beauty<br />\nparlor, and overnight we will<br />\nhave 25 million poor facsimiles<br />\nof the stylish first lady.<br />\nThe reasons for such a political .degeneration lie in the very<br />\nnature of the American two<br />\nparty system. Once upon a time,<br />\nas. everybody knows, the Republicans were a homogenous party<br />\nand the Democrats were a homogeneous party. Then years passed and time and change slowly<br />\nresulted in the utter collapse of<br />\nthe political party as it was<br />\noriginally conceived. Now neither<br />\nparty can claim to represent a<br />\nsingle unified political ideology.<br />\nBut Americans, like their<br />\nBritish counterparts, cherish<br />\ntradition, if only secretly. Thus<br />\na Republican like Rockerfeller<br />\nbelongs to the same national<br />\nparty as Barry Goldwater of<br />\nArizona. And Paul Douglas of<br />\nIllinois in name belongs to the<br />\nsame Democratic Party as James<br />\n0. Eastland of Mississippi.<br />\nTime for Change<br />\nIt is about time that both<br />\nparties faced reality. After years<br />\nof pretending there were no<br />\nsplits in either party, after<br />\nyears of convention activity to<br />\nhide existing splits, after years<br />\nof frustrated battle by both factions, it should now be apparent<br />\nthat America itself can no longer bury its collective head in<br /><br />\nWaverly Laundromat<br />\n3330 Greenmount Ave.<br />\nDaily 8 A.M. to 6 P.M.<br />\nMon., Thurs., Fri.

Or, for that matter, Stardust.<br />\nPerhaps you are asking why there should be such a fraternity<br />\nas Signa Phi Nothing. I will give you an answer\u2014an answer<br />\nwith which you cannot possibly disagree: Signa Phi Nothing<br />\nfills a well-needed gap.<br />\nAre you suffering from mental health? Is logic distorting<br />\nyour thinking? Is ambition encroaching on your native sloth?<br />\nAre your long-cherished misapprehensions retreating before a<br />\nsea of facts? In short, has education caught up with you?<br />\nIf so, congratulations. But tell the truth\u2014wouldn't you like<br />\nto make an occasional visit back to the good old days when you<br />\nwere not so wise and composed and industrious\u2014when you<br />\nwere, in fact, nuttier than a fruitcake?<br />\nIf you pine for those old familiar miasms, those dear, dead<br />\nvapors, join Signa Phi Nothing and renew, for a fleeting<br />\nmoment, your acquaintance with futility. We promise nothing,<br />\nand, by George, we deliver it<br />\n0 1961 Max Shulman<br /><br />\nWe, the makers of Marlboro, promise smoking pleasure and<br />\nwe think you'll think we deliver it\u2014both from Marlboro and<br />\nfrom our new unfiltered king-size Philip Morris Commander.<br /><br />\nWelcome aboard!<br /><br />\nthe sand in order to ignore the<br />\nfact that neither party is unified<br />\nexcept in name. It is time for<br />\nthe politicians to stop making<br />\nshows of unity in public while<br />\nthey fight and jockey for position and power in private.<br />\nIf Kennedy is ever to conquer<br />\nhis frontier, he must do so with<br />\na different Democratic party. In<br />\n1933, when Roosevelt came into<br />\noffice, he had the support of the<br />\nsame coalition Kennedy must<br />\nnow depend upon. In fact, it was<br />\nRoosevelt who created the union of the ' Southern Democrat<br />\nand the Northern Cities which<br />\nhas become the victorious Democratic party of 1961. But Roosevelt for many reasons was able<br />\nto control this schizophrenic<br />\ngroup.<br />\nToday it is doubtful whether<br />\nKennedy can achieve the same<br />\nsuccess. In the intervening 35<br />\nyears the South has discovered<br />\na new ally, the arch conservative wing of the Republican<br />\nparty. And this coalition is not<br />\nonly strong, but it also has the<br />\nadvantage of sharing much the<br />\nsame ideology. If Kennedy is to<br />\naccomplish his program he must<br />\ndo so without and despite the<br />\nSouth, or he must find some way<br />\nto force the South into line. And<br />\nrealistically the latter possibility<br />\nseems quite remote.<br />\nNew Parties<br />\nBut even if Kennedy succeeds,<br />\nwhat will happen when he leaves<br />\noffice? And what of the fundamental liberal-conservative split<br />\nin the Republican camp. Both<br />\nparties suffer from identical<br />\nevils. Both are split along the<br />\nsame lines. What is needed is not<br />\nenforced unity and unwanted<br />\ncooperation within parties. The<br />\nliberal-conservative split cannot diminish with time.<br />\nThere seems to be but one<br />\nrealistic solution. And that is<br />\ncompletely to realign political<br />\naffiliations within the country.<br />\nWe do not need a Democratic<br />\n(Continued on Page 6)<br /><br />\nkeep a head of the game!<br />\nGentlemen preferred by blondes, brunettes, and redheads<br />\nprefer 'Vaseline' Hair Tonic.

But now he is being<br />\nthwarted by not only the Republicans but also by members of<br />\nhis own party who actively campaigned for him. And what is<br />\nhappening to Kennedy might<br />\nwell happen to our next president and those who follow.<br /><br />\nit is necessary that we first have<br />\na complete reorganization of the<br />\npolitical parties. Without such<br />\na reorganization every administration will be hampered and<br />\nprevented from fulfilling its<br />\nproper function.

Homer Schwartz and<br />\nMike Ratner each had their best<br />\nnights of the year and finished<br />\nWith 17 points. Phil Berger provided his usual fine floor leadership, and Mark Weiss led the<br />\nteam in rebounds. Ed Greenberg didn't lead in anything, but<br />\nMade his presence known on the<br />\ncourt by copping a number of<br />\nrebounds and scoring 8 points.<br />\nThe big heroes of the game,<br />\nhowever, were the 3 Hopkins<br />\n\"Mighty Mice\", Pete Thompson,<br />\nJohn Heller, and Jack White.<br />\nComing in after Ratner, Berger,<br />\nand Greenberg had fouled out,<br />\nthese three fellows hustled and<br />\nProvided the spark which relit<br />\nthe blaze.
