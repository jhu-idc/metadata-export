Wilson Shaffer. A News-Letter editorial of October 3 had also supported the plan.<br />\nBut it was rejected with only one vote cast in its<br />\nfavor. There were two arguments: (1) It's too near<br />\nrushing, and (2) the Board is doing a competent job.<br />\nIt has now been over two months since rushing ended<br />\nand the motion has still not been re-considered. Moreover, the Board has, in several instances, shown evidences<br />\nof its weaknesses. It is not doing a competent job.<br />\nThe manner in which the IFB has handled the application of Zeta Beta Tau, the seething mass of rushing<br />\nviolations, the absence of officers from IFB meetings and<br />\nthe lateness with which fraternity grades were turned in<br />\nto the Registrar are examples.<br />\nWe feel that these cases are not unusual but clear<br />\nindications that something is. lacking in the makeup of<br />\nthe Board. Many fraternity members, moreover, feel<br />\nthat the prestige and effectiveness of the Board, while<br />\nDot completely gone, has deteriorated.<br />\nToo often, the position of IFB delegate is considered<br />\ntoo lightly by fraternities. A man may often be assigned<br />\nto this job only because it is felt any job will boost his<br />\nmorale and help him generally.<br />\nWe submit that one way to raise the effectiveness<br />\nand prestige would be to seat the president of each fraternity as the delegate to the Board. By making the<br />\npresident the representative, men of greater ability would<br />\nsit, and would thereby give the decisions of the Board<br />\ngreater weight and insure their more careful consideration by the community as a whole.<br />\nSeveral fraternities already seem to realize this.<br />\nFive fraternities are now represented on the IFB by<br />\ntheir presidents.

Wilson Shaffer. A News-Letter editorial of October 3 had also supported the plan.<br />\nBut it was rejected with only one vote cast in its<br />\nfavor. There were two arguments: (1) It's too near<br />\nrushing, and (2) the Board is doing a competent job.<br />\nIt has now been over two months since rushing ended<br />\nand the motion has still not been re-considered. Moreover, the Board has, in several instances, shown evidences<br />\nof its weaknesses. It is not doing a competent job.<br />\nThe manner in which the IFB has handled the application of Zeta Beta Tau, the seething mass of rushing<br />\nviolations, the absence of officers from IFB meetings and<br />\nthe lateness with which fraternity grades were turned in<br />\nto the Registrar are examples.<br />\nWe feel that these cases are not unusual but clear<br />\nindications that something is. lacking in the makeup of<br />\nthe Board. Many fraternity members, moreover, feel<br />\nthat the prestige and effectiveness of the Board, while<br />\nDot completely gone, has deteriorated.<br />\nToo often, the position of IFB delegate is considered<br />\ntoo lightly by fraternities. A man may often be assigned<br />\nto this job only because it is felt any job will boost his<br />\nmorale and help him generally.<br />\nWe submit that one way to raise the effectiveness<br />\nand prestige would be to seat the president of each fraternity as the delegate to the Board. By making the<br />\npresident the representative, men of greater ability would<br />\nsit, and would thereby give the decisions of the Board<br />\ngreater weight and insure their more careful consideration by the community as a whole.<br />\nSeveral fraternities already seem to realize this.<br />\nFive fraternities are now represented on the IFB by<br />\ntheir presidents.
