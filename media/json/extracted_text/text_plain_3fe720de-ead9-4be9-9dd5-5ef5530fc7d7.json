Dr. Farsoun<br />\nwas born in British Palestine<br />\nand grew up in Lebanon.<br />\nFarsoun began by saying that<br />\nthe Lebanon invasion is \"a side<br />\nshow,\" and that the Palestinian<br />\nArabs are the real issue in the<br />\nMiddle East. He also stressed<br />\nthat Lebanon's civil war was an<br />\ninternal conflict, with the<br />\nPalestinian Arabs caught up in<br />\nthe fighting.<br />\nFarsoun pointed out that the<br />\nPLO has been recognized by<br />\n112 nations and has 94 full<br />\ndiplomatic missions. It also has<br />\nUnited Nations observer status.<br />\nFarsoun feels that the PLO is<br />\nthe true representative of the<br />\nPalestinian Arabs through a national parliament in exile and<br />\nvarious \"unions.\" He asserted<br />\nthat it is the U.S. and Israel that<br />\noppose a Palestinian Arab state<br />\nin the West Bank and the Gaza<br />\nStrip. Farsoun also stated that<br />\n<br />\nIsrael's plan for a greater Eretz<br />\nYisroel (Palestine) included<br />\npart of Syria (the Golan<br />\nHeights), part of Jordan (the<br />\nWest Bank) and Egypt (Sinai<br />\nterritory returned by Israel to<br />\nEgypt under the Camp David<br />\nTreaty).<br />\nHistorically, Dr. Farsoun<br />\nsaid that Palestinian Arabs<br />\nhave lived in Palestine since<br />\nsixth or seventh century A.D.<br />\nHe said it was the rise of<br />\nZionism (the desire for a Jewish<br />\nhomeland in Palestine) in the<br />\nearly twentieth century in<br />\nEurope that set the stage for the<br />\npresent situation.<br />\nThe British and French attempted to carve out ethnic and<br />\nreligious states in the Middle<br />\nEast and partially succeeded,<br />\naccording to Farsoun. He said<br />\nthat is why Lebanon's political<br />\nstructure is so fragile.<br />\nDr. Fa-Noun noted that between 1936 and 1939, Palestinian Arabs revolted against incoming Zionists and the British.<br />\nThis uprising was defeated.<br />\nBy 1945, the population of<br />\nPalestine was one-third Jewish<br />\nas a result of World War II. In<br />\n1947, the United Nations voted<br />\n<br />\nSenior Films Cancels<br />\nDeep Throat Show<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nMaryland State Board of Censors, the last state censor board<br />\nleft in the nation, was abolished. Until that time, all films<br />\nwere viewed by the board<br />\nbefore they could be shown in<br />\nMaryland. Under the current<br />\nsystem, a complaint must be<br />\nlodged with the police. According to the Baltimore City<br />\nGeneral Council Division of the<br />\nLaw Department, a determination would be made if the film<br />\nwas obscene. Because of court<br />\n<br />\nrulings on obscenity laws, the<br />\ndetermination of obscenity<br />\nmust take into account the<br />\nvalues of the community. An<br />\nexample cited by the division is<br />\nthat a film that was declared<br />\nobscene on Broadway may be<br />\ndeclared not obscene when<br />\nshown at the \"Block\".<br />\nAccording to the Baltimore<br />\nPolice Department Vice Division, since Deep Throat was<br />\nruled obscene in Baltimore in<br />\n1974, the police would have no<br />\nchoice but to raid the film.<br />\n<br />\nto partition Palestine into a<br />\nJewish state, Israel, and an<br />\nArab state, Palestine. Farsoun<br />\ntermed this action \"gerrymandering.\" (This is the<br />\npractice of drawing boundaries<br />\nfor political goals without<br />\nregard to public benefit.) Farsoun said that the Palestinian<br />\nArabs were not consulted on<br />\nthis matter.<br />\nIn May 1948, during the first<br />\nArab-Israeli war, Jordan occupied the West Bank and<br />\nEgypt took the Gaza strip.<br />\nThey held these areas until<br />\n1967, when they were taken by<br />\nIsrael.<br />\n<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nThe new wing, designed by<br />\nthe Philadelphia firm of Bower<br />\nLewis Thrower/Architects,<br />\ncomplements the original neoclassical building of 1929 by using limestone to match the<br />\noriginal facade. The design of<br />\nthe building also includes a<br />\ncurved wall of taupe ceramic<br />\ntile and a glass-windowed loggia over the new entrance. An<br />\nimportant feature of the<br />\nmuseum's new building is that<br />\nit can function as an independent unit at times, thereby<br />\nallowing the museum to expand<br />\nits evening hours at a minimal<br />\nexpense.<br />\nAlso, tLe new wing features<br />\na special lighting system blending artificial and natural light,<br />\nso that the art can be viewed<br />\nunder the best possible conditions, as well as a modern computerized security and fire<br />\ndetection and prevention<br />\nsystem and a climate control<br />\nsystem to protect the art work<br />\nby maintaining proper humidity and temperature.<br />\nThe planning of the renovation project began ten years<br />\nago; however, the actual construction and renovation has<br />\nonly taken three years.

Eisenhower<br />\nlit his lamppost several nights a week and<br />\nbetween five and fifteen students attended<br />\nnightly. Through events such as this, the<br />\npresident was able to achieve an understanding of student concerns,<br />\nIn recent years, many students have complained that President Muller is never seen<br />\non campus. A standard joke is that as a student you get to meet the president twice:<br />\nonce, when he shakes your hand at orientation and again at graduation when you<br />\nrecieve your diploma. For most students this<br />\nis true. One of the reasons for Muller's lack<br />\nof contact with students is that he has many<br />\ntime consuming commitments. He is the first<br />\nUniversity president to also be the president<br />\nof Johns Hopkins Hospital. His involvements with the Federal Reserve Bank<br />\n<br />\nof Richmond and various organizations dealing with higher education also place constraints on his time. It is not surprising that<br />\nhe has little time to spend with<br />\nundergraduates.;<br />\nLast Thursday,however, many students<br />\nreceived a surprise. Muller, accompanied by<br />\nStudent Council President Doug Fel'man,<br />\nspent an hour touring the campus. His walk,<br />\nwhich took him to such places as Levering<br />\nHall and the Gilman mail room gave him an<br />\nopportunity to meet students and discuss<br />\ntheir problems and concerns. We do not<br />\nknow if Muller intends to take these walks<br />\nregularly but it would certainly. be-a good<br />\nidea for both students and the president.. It<br />\nallows Muller to get a better understanding<br />\nof students and this is important if he gets<br />\ninvolved with undergraduate education.<br />\nStudents should not expect Muller to invite<br />\nstudents to watch television with him; he<br />\ndoes not even live in Nichols House. Yet by<br />\ncontinuing activities such as his campus<br />\nwalks he is taking an important step to increase interaction between undergraduates<br />\nand himself.<br />\n<br />\nArt Museum Membership<br />\nUntil several months ago,admission to the<br />\nBaltimore Museum Of Art was t'ree.<br />\nHowever, with the implementation of an admission fee, the Museum also established a<br />\npolicy by which college students could visit<br />\nthe Museum free of charge if the college took<br />\nout an official membership. So far Hopkins<br />\nhas taken no action although negotiations<br />\nare in process.<br />\nHopkins students have failed to take advantage of the Art Museum despite its proximity to the campus. Now that admission<br />\nis being charged, student attendance will likely diminish even further. A two or three<br />\ndollar charge may be prohibitive to someone<br />\nwho only wishes to spend a few minutes<br />\nbrowsing at paintings. A University member-<br />\n<br />\nship would at least prevent a decline in student interest and attendance. The cost of<br />\nmembership is meager, less than 400 dollars.<br />\nGoucher College and the Maryland Institute<br />\nof Art have already taken advantage of this<br />\nopportunity. There is no excuse for Hopkins<br />\nto delay its membership. It is something that<br />\npopularity and common sense would mandate anyway.<br />\nHopkins has failed to encourage student<br />\ninterest in the Art Museum. The Art History<br />\ndepartment, for instance, should consider<br />\nholding classes in the museum. However, a<br />\nfirst step for the University should be to take.<br />\nout a museum membership as soon as possible so that Hopkins students can visit the<br />\nMuseum free of charge.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nCharm City Is The One That Receives The Unfair Advantages<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe article \"Lapides<br />\nDiscusses Issues\" in your issue<br />\nof 24 September states that the<br />\ncurrent system of educational<br />\nsubsidies in Maryland \"gives<br />\nthe children of the wealthier<br />\nsuburbs an unfair advantage<br />\nover children from poorer<br />\ndistricts...\" My heart would<br />\nbleed more for Baltimore City,<br />\npresumably one of the<br />\n\"poorer\" jurisdictions, if the<br />\nfacts did not show that \"Charm<br />\nCity\" receives an unfair subsidy<br />\nat the expense of smaller<br />\ndistricts. Using figures released by the<br />\n<br />\nState of Maryland for the last<br />\nfiscal year for which I could obtain such figures, let us compare the budget of the City of<br />\nBaltimore with those of two<br />\n<br />\ntypical Maryland counties,<br />\nFrederick and Montomery,<br />\nneither of which has experienced anything like Baltimore's<br />\n\"urban renaissance.\" In fiscal<br />\nyear 1978, Frederick County<br />\nhad to raise 53.2 percent of its<br />\nbudget from local revenues;<br />\nMontgomery, 75 percent. Certainly, neither of these counties<br />\nreceived undue cash at the expense of Baltimore City, which<br />\nhad to raise a piddling 33.1 percent of its budget from local<br />\nrevenues. Moreover, \"poor\"<br />\nBalt-imore somehow managed<br />\nto afford a FY '78 budget of<br />\n$1,767 per capita, well over<br />\nMontgomery's $1,066 and<br />\nmore than double Frederick's<br />\n$778. We can easily see why<br />\nboth Frederick and Montgomery oppose giving extra<br />\nmoney to Baltifinote.<br />\n<br />\nNor has Baltimore City<br />\nstrained itself to provide education funds. In FY '78,<br />\nBaltimore City coughed up only 21.1 percent of its bloated<br />\nbudget for education, a negligible amount compared to Montgomery's 49.0 percent and<br />\nFrederick's 51.7 percent.<br />\nIndeed, one state legislator<br />\nhas estimated that Montgomery<br />\nCounty receives only 27 cents in<br />\nstate services for every dollar it<br />\nsends to Annapolis in state<br />\ntaxes. Moreover, Baltimore,<br />\nwith its vast industrial base and<br />\nits excellent port, uses its huge<br />\nblock of Annapolis votes to extort money from more rural<br />\ncounties. So who has an \"unfair advantage\" over whom?<br />\n<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nDavid J. Edmondson<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nChaplain's Office Deserves Praise For Fairness<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWe are writing in response to<br />\nyour article concerning the<br />\nJSA's objection to the programs sponsored by the<br />\nChaplain on the Middle East.<br />\nTo quote the News-Letter ,<br />\n\"The JSA objected because the<br />\nprogram was scheduled before<br />\nthe beginning of Yom Kippur.\"<br />\nWhy then the fuss? If the argument behind the JSA's criticism<br />\nof the Chaplain was to have the<br />\nprogram re-scheduled in order<br />\nto allow more JSA members to<br />\nattend, it is a weak one. For<br />\nwhen the JSA itself sponsored<br />\nthe Israeli Vice-Consul (on a<br />\nThursday night, presumably a<br />\ntime at which many JSA<br />\nmembers could be present), attendance was poor. Moreover,<br />\n\"many Jewish students came to<br />\nthe program and apparently did<br />\nnot feel the scheduling was unfair.\" It would appear that in<br />\nhis zeal, the president of the<br />\nJSA overlooked this somewhat<br />\nimportant point.<br />\nFurthermore, we find it objectionable that the JSA has<br />\ntried to interfere with the<br />\nChaplain's Office activities.<br />\nHow would the JSA like to see<br />\nother campus groups interfere<br />\nwith their activities?<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office is an<br />\nautonomous organization<br />\nunder no obligation to enter into any \"agreement\" with the<br />\nJSA, if it wishes otherwise. The<br />\nChaplain's Office is by no<br />\nmeans responsible to the JSA<br />\nand can \"violate\" any \"agreement\" that would limit its<br />\nfreedom of action.<br />\nIt is also offending to have<br />\nthe JSA depict the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice as an organization that<br />\nsponsors solely \"leftist rallies.\"<br />\n(Shades of red baiting?) It is<br />\neven more incredible that the<br />\nJSA objected to the Chaplain's<br />\nprogram as \"biased,\" even<br />\nthough it had not yet been<br />\npresented and despite the fact<br />\nthat the Chaplain was sponsoring a pro-Israeli speaker the upcoming week!<br />\nWe attended Professor Farsoun's presentation and found<br />\n(to our own surprise!) that he<br />\nwas in fact quite moderate. We<br />\nalso recall that Seth Kaye(who<br />\ndespite his objections, was able<br />\nto come) did not criticize the<br />\nprofessor or have much to say.<br />\nIn comparison, the Israeli viceconsul (or the A1PAC speaker<br />\n<br />\nsponsored by the JSA last year<br />\nat the height of the AWACS<br />\ncontroversy) could hardly be<br />\ncalled objective. It is not that<br />\nwe mind the bias of the JSA<br />\nspeakers. On the contrary, it is<br />\ninevitable in so polarized an<br />\nissue. What we do object to is<br />\nSeth Kaye's insistence that any<br />\nopposing opinions are illegitimate (\"biased\" is a nicer<br />\nway of putting it). In the interest of education, both sides<br />\nmust be presented. The<br />\nChaplain's Office should be<br />\npraised for having done so.<br />\nIn conclusion, a balanced<br />\nview on the Middle East should<br />\nbe defined as a pro-Palestinian<br />\nspeaker for every pro-Israeli<br />\nspeaker.

The attendance, net profit, and number of problems<br />\nare all factors in determining<br />\nthe success of a movie, and<br />\nDebbie Does Dallas had the<br />\nhighest attendance and profit of<br />\nany film last year, and virtually no problems other than a bit<br />\nmore attention from local<br />\nmedia (because of UMBC)than<br />\nwe cared for.<br />\nWe were not asked at any<br />\ntime to get our schedule approved, and since this had not<br />\nbeen done in the past, we<br />\nfollowed custom and decided<br />\non the merits of each film<br />\nourselves. Furthermore, the only request we had was from the<br />\nSAC Office\u2014not to schedule<br />\nany X-rated movie for Parents'<br />\nWeekend, since that had been<br />\ndone originally last year.<br />\nBecause of objections from<br />\ncertain groups, Chris Colombo<br />\nadvised the Senior Class officers not to show Deep Throat.<br />\nWe maintained that the problems caused by cancelling the<br />\nmovie outweighed the possible<br />\nproblems and hassles caused by<br />\na decision made against our<br />\nbest judgement, we stated that<br />\nwe would resign if the movie<br />\nwere cancelled.<br />\nThe Senior Class officers<br />\nfinally decided to show the<br />\nfilm, and everything settled<br />\ndown\u2014for a few days. Then<br />\nthe officers talked to Chris Colombo again and were told that<br />\n<br />\nthere was a chance that the vice<br />\nsquad could come to campus,<br />\nimpound the film, and arrest<br />\npeople associated with the film.<br />\nThe same chance existed last<br />\nyear, but the Senior Class officers were informed by the vice<br />\nsquad, very unofficially, that<br />\nnothing would happen.<br />\nRegardless, this year the class<br />\nofficers reversed their previous<br />\ndecision and decided to cancel<br />\nthe movie. In order to keep the<br />\nfilm, we had to try to get confirmation of last year's handsoff policy of the vice squad. It<br />\nturned out that the only way to<br />\nget such a confirmation was to<br />\ntalk to the vice squad. But this<br />\ntime they gave no such<br />\nassurance; rather, they said that<br />\nthey would quite possibly raid.<br />\nThis was probably due to the<br />\nfact that Deep Throat had<br />\nalready been declared obscene<br />\nby the courts, so that they could<br />\nhardly approve of us showing<br />\nit. After hearing that, we had<br />\nno choice but to cancel the<br />\nmovie. Since we now agreed<br />\nthat there was no alternative,<br />\nwe decided not to resign.<br />\nHowever, we still believe that if<br />\nwe had shown the movie, we<br />\nwould have had no problems.<br />\nWe have replaced Deep<br />\nThroat with Last Tango in<br />\nParis, a film approved by the<br />\nSenior Class and also by the<br />\nvice squad, so now nobody<br />\nneeds to worry about spending<br />\na night in jail.

Two<br />\nmachines, a Digital Equipment<br />\nCorporation PDP 11/45 running UNIX, and a VAX 11/780<br />\nrunning VMS, are the primary<br />\ncomponents of the Engineering<br />\nComputing Facility. These two<br />\ncomputers, located in Barton<br />\nHall, are complemented by the<br />\nthree computers in the basement of Garland Hall. The administrative tasks occupy the<br />\ntime of the two smaller computers, while the IBM 4341<br />\nserves as the workhorse for student computation.<br />\nThe 4341 is quite new to<br />\nHopkins, replacing a less<br />\npowerful DEC System 10, only five to six months ago. The<br />\ncomputers are linked together<br />\nby a Gandalf PACX IV, which<br />\nisanalogousto the main switch<br />\nbox in a house.<br />\nThe PACX connects all the<br />\nterminals on campus, private<br />\nterminals, the terminals at the<br />\nApplied Physics Lab and the<br />\nGraphics Lab in Barton with<br />\nthe computers. The PACX will<br />\nalso interface remote terminals<br />\nor computers by telephone line<br />\n(via modems).<br />\nThe specifications of the<br />\nHopkins computers is an interesting topic, but for more<br />\ndetailed information, consult a<br />\nprofessor familiar with the<br />\nequipment. Consult Mr. Jesse,<br />\nin Barton, for more information about the PDP and the<br />\nVAX machines, or Mr. Binko,<br />\nin Garland, concerning the<br />\nIBM computer.<br />\nThere . are<br />\nnumerous<br />\nlanguages available to the computer. user.

The<br />\nlargest collection of terminals<br />\nset up for student use is in<br />\nMaryland 109.<br />\nTerminals are also available<br />\nin Latrobe Hall. These terminals tend to go unnoticed by<br />\nthe majority of Hopkins<br />\nstudents, and are available<br />\nquite often. Lucky students<br />\nwho work in a laboratory may<br />\nfind a terminal nearby. And for<br />\nanyone with either a terminal or<br />\na personal computer (with<br />\nmodem), the PACX dial up line<br />\nis 338-8600, and available just<br />\n'about any time.<br />\nThe Graphics Lab facilities<br />\nare another option.

The account allows you<br />\nto sign on the computer, keeps<br />\ntrack of your time on the<br />\nmachine, and allocates space<br />\nfor you to store programs or<br />\ndata.<br />\nThere are several ways of getting an account if you are a<br />\nHopkins student. An instructional account is free for the<br />\nasking, and is available on all<br />\nthree machines. This type of account limits your time on the<br />\nmachine, and you can hold only<br />\none instructional account. To<br />\nget such an account, you should<br />\ngo to the UCC offiee in the basemein ot Garland Hall. There,<br />\n<br />\nafter filling out a form, you'll<br />\nreceive an account and<br />\npassword, which gives you access to the computers.<br />\nIf you have a course which<br />\nteaches or requires programming, the professor will get an account for the use of the class.<br />\nThis type of account is also<br />\nlimited by time, and by.which<br />\ncomputer vou can use:<br />\nDue to the recent expenditure<br />\non the new IBM, the future<br />\nplans t'or the computing center<br />\nare somewhat nebulous. The<br />\naquisition of the IBM was a<br />\nlarge step in computing power,<br />\nand is probably the last big expenditure the University will<br />\nmake for a while. In the near<br />\nfuture, there are plans to increase inter-computer communications, and to slowly increase the disk memory storage<br />\nof the machines. New equipment may be purchased by the<br />\ncomputing center, which is advised by a standing Homewood<br />\ncommittee,,or by professors<br />\nallocating a 'portion of their<br />\ngrant funding to improve a particular function of a computer.<br />\nNew lines to terminals are to be<br />\nconsidered, and software (the<br />\nprograms) is ccintinually considered.

The film<br />\nmakes an indelible impression simply because you've never seen anything<br />\nquite like it\u2014quite so sick, you might<br />\nsay with a shudder, but also funny,<br />\nin a perverse way... Edie plays the old<br />\nsingle-toothed fat lady who spends<br />\nher time in an oversized playpen,<br />\nstuffing eggs into her face and crying for the Eggman. There is<br />\nsomething about Edie that makes her<br />\nstand out; Divine, the \"heroine,\"<br />\nchampions her position as \"sickest<br />\nperson in the world,\" while Edie the<br />\nEgg Lady is content to lounge in her<br />\npen and gorge herself on eggs. This<br />\ncharacter is now\u2014for certain cult<br />\ncircles, at least\u2014close to imortal.<br />\nBut there is more to Edith Massey<br />\nbesides her role as the Egg Lady. She<br />\nhas recently returned from the west<br />\ncoast, where she cut her first record,<br />\n\"Punks, Get off the Grass,\" with a<br />\nflip side remake of Frankie Valli's<br />\n\"Big Girls Don't Cry.\" While singing, Edie performs. Her voice is<br />\nraspy, urgent and punklike in<br />\nessence. For the past ten years, Edie<br />\nhas also been proprietor of \"Edith's<br />\nShopping Bag,\" a well-known store<br />\non South Broadway in Fells Point.<br />\nOutside, the store is unimposing:<br />\na simple wooden sign, and in front<br />\nof the store window, an oldfashioned bureau miror on a table<br />\nwith elegant patio chairs around it.<br />\nThe interior is dense with a curious<br />\nmelange of items; a browser's<br />\nparadise. A shelf along the left wall<br />\nhas about a dozen mannaquin heads<br />\nsitting, disembodied, in a sort of<br />\ntribunal row (they also remind one of<br />\nthe completely hairless, caricaturish<br />\nface of Divine); above these, the mirrored wall is plastered with<br />\nRockshots, the greeting cards which<br />\nfeature Edie's series of six called<br />\n.\"Edie the Egg Lady Goes<br />\nRockshots.\" One of these, captioned \"Season's Beatings,\" shows Edie<br />\nin her famous leather outfit holding<br />\na whip over a cringing Santa Claus.<br />\nCards dominate a good part of the<br />\nstore; there are racks on both sides<br />\nand swivel racks in the middle,<br />\nfeaturing, besides Rockshots, movie<br />\n<br />\nstar cards and joke celebrity cards,<br />\nportraying Ronald Reagan picking<br />\nhis nose, Nancy snorting cocaine.<br />\nEven with a varied assortment of<br />\nclothing,<br />\nmerchandise\u2014wigs,<br />\nposters, books, records, bottle<br />\nopeners, cigarette lighters, twisted<br />\npencils, costume jewelry\u2014the store<br />\ntranscends being a junk shop; it is a<br />\nveritable flea-market, and it reflects<br />\nthe varied tastes of Edith Massey.<br />\nThe following interview with Edie<br />\ntakes place on a pleasant afternoon<br />\noutside her store. People occasionally stop by to say hello to Edie<br />\nor have her sign a card, and at first<br />\nwe're slightly bothered by bees.

What about<br />\nyou?<br />\nN.L.: I'm...pretty faithful.<br />\nEDIE: What sign are you?<br />\nN.L.: Oh. Aries.<br />\nEDIE: I don't know\u2014you're hairy,<br />\nall right, but I don't know...<br />\nN.L.: Aries.<br />\nEDIE: Aries. What's that?<br />\nN.L.: The ram.<br />\n<br />\n\fA Different Kind of Bag Lady<br />\nEDIE: The ram, but I don't know<br />\nnothin' about you. I'll be honest. I<br />\njust know\u2014if I have a boyfriend, one<br />\nwas a Libra, and, you know, when<br />\nI was younger I kind of read a little<br />\nbut... they say I'm five different<br />\nwomen on the weekend.<br />\nN.L.: Okay. So, you met John<br />\nacross the street.<br />\nEDIE: Right there, and I had<br />\nseventy, eighty, a hundred people to<br />\nwait on on the weekends. But the kids<br />\nwere really great; they always helped<br />\nme, they helped me at the bar, they<br />\nhelped wait on people. The kids from<br />\ncollege used to come down and take<br />\nme home every night; they were<br />\ngreat.<br />\nN.L.: Terrific. So when .did John<br />\ndecide to put you in his movies?<br />\nEDIE: Well, they were makin'<br />\nMultiple Maniacs, and he asked<br />\nwould I play Jesus' mother; and, you<br />\nknow, who knows what Jesus'<br />\nmother looked like?<br />\nN.L.: The Virgin Mary.<br />\nEDIE: Yeah.<br />\nN.L.: That must've been a fun<br />\npart.<br />\n<br />\n\"I didn't ever care<br />\nfor Frank Sinatra.<br />\nJohn said in his<br />\nbook, 'Who would<br />\nyou like to go eat<br />\nwith?' I didn't say<br />\nFrankie. I said Bob<br />\nBarker.\"<br />\nEDIE: And then also being I worked there he gave me\u2014he liked, I<br />\nguess, what I did, so he have me the<br />\nRat-Fink Barmaid.<br />\nN.L.: Another picture?<br />\nEDIE: Same picture. You see,<br />\nJesus' mother had sheets all over her,<br />\nso the other part I had furs, and a<br />\nbunch of...<br />\nN.L.: You never acted before that?<br />\nEDIE: No.<br />\nN.L.: How did you find acting?<br />\nEDIE: Oh, I liked it. Well, I laughed at first. I told my brother, \"I'm<br />\nin a movie; you ought to come see<br />\nit.\" I said you have to be sick to see<br />\nit. He's a criminologist. So he came<br />\nand he loved it\u2014he just loved it; he<br />\nlaughed and laughed.<br />\nN.L.: What came after Multiple<br />\nManiacs?<br />\nEDIE: Pink Flamingos, Female<br />\nTrouble, Desperate Living\u2014then Bob<br />\nMyers, who helps with the movies, he<br />\nmade the story A Love-Letter to<br />\nEdie, that's in the Pratt Library. It's<br />\nnice\u2014you ought to go see it\u2014it's in<br />\ncolor and everything. He did a nice<br />\njob. Then Polyester. And we're gonna do a new movie. I'm gonna be a<br />\nShakespearean actress and a<br />\nShakespeare teacher. And Divine\u2014<br />\nthis is as far as I know now\u2014Divine<br />\nis gonna be triplets.<br />\nN.L.: In one?<br />\nEDIE: Yeah, in the same movie<br />\nshe's gonna be triplets. John's writing<br />\nit now; it might change, you know.<br />\nN.L.: Okay. Now I only saw Pink<br />\nFlamingos\u2014I loved Pink Flamingos,<br />\njust loved it. Then I saw part of<br />\n.Female Trouble, but my girlfriend<br />\nwanted to walk out, so...<br />\n<br />\nEDIE: Wonder why she walked<br />\n,out? She should've just laughed at it,,<br />\nbecause it ain't really nothin', you<br />\n,know. There's a few things that I<br />\ndon't like in John's movies, but I put<br />\nmy head down. I wouldn't want a lot<br />\nof that stuff to really happen, but\u2014<br />\nwho eats people? I mean there's people who have done it\u2014I read about<br />\n'em, you know?<br />\nN.L.: Right.<br />\nEDIE: But who goes ahead and<br />\neats the bones and stuff\u2014you know<br />\nit ain't true. Like even me in<br />\nDesperate Living, I have all these<br />\nlovers, but I don't think\u2014close it off'<br />\nand I'll tell you.<br />\n[Tape is shut]<br />\nKids'd think I was terrible if I say<br />\nanything rough\u2014too rough.<br />\n\"Pun<br />\nGet off the Grass.\"<br />\nEverybody likes that one.

Edie<br />\nsays: \"I love animals, so if I act ickyicky, don't pay no attention to it.

You're not in a particular<br />\nband?<br />\nEDIE: Yeah, I sing with different<br />\npeople. What I do ain't hard.<br />\nBecause, like anything I do\u2014I was in<br />\nCanada once, and I didn't have no<br />\n<br />\nband because my promoter spent the<br />\nmoney. And I didn't know I had to go,<br />\nand they called me up, \"Are you<br />\ncomin'?\" and I said I have no band,<br />\nI didn't know nothin' about it. Well<br />\nanyway, so they got me a band when<br />\nI got up there, I practiced an hour<br />\nand half with them, and we played<br />\nthree nights in a row like we been<br />\nthere together for twenty years. They<br />\nwere so good, the band. And they<br />\nsaid they loved it, you know. Then<br />\nI was more punky, too. I was tellin'<br />\nthem, \"Go strangle yourselves,<br />\npunks.\" They said,\"Oh, Edie, you're<br />\nbeautiful. I love you Edie.\" And<br />\nI said, \"Go strangle yourselves.\"<br />\nAnd some of'em would be hurl. But<br />\nit was all in fun. But lately I've been<br />\nthrowin' eggs, and stuff like that.<br />\nN.L.: Okay. Since you mention the<br />\neggs, when did \"Edie the Egg Lady\"<br />\nstart? That was in Pink Flamingos.<br />\nEDIE: Yeah. I can't lose it,<br />\nbecause Pink Flamingos plays<br />\nconstantly.<br />\nN.L.: Yes. So it just stuck because<br />\nof the movie?<br />\nEDIE: Oh, I don't care. I eat eggs<br />\nanyway.<br />\nN.L.: You like eggs?<br />\nEDIE: Yeah, in the morning I eat<br />\na couple of eggs.<br />\nN.L.: What about the Eggman?<br />\nEDIE: He's nice. I don't know. I'd<br />\nfall for you and him [N.L.<br />\nPhotographer] before the Eggman.<br />\nN.L.: Were you ever married,<br />\nEdie?<br />\nEDIE: Yeah. That's my husband's<br />\nname I use, Massey.<br />\nN.L.: Did you have any children?<br />\nED1E: No. Well, I helped raise a<br />\n<br />\ncouple; they're like my kids. And I<br />\ngot nothin' but children now. What<br />\nmore do I need? I'm like the old lady<br />\nin the shoe; she got so many children<br />\nshe don't know what to do. That's<br />\nme.<br />\nN.L.: Are you friendly with the<br />\n(other people in the films?<br />\nEDIE: Oh, sure. And the gay people love me, whiA makes me happy,<br />\nyou know.

I saw the movie<br />\nthree years ago. It was a wild<br />\nexperience\u2014everyone was really into the movie.<br />\nEDIE: Yeah, you know, I don't<br />\nunderstand but there's some kids<br />\nseem' it and seem' it; they can say<br />\nevery word there is, repeat every<br />\nword there is in the movie.<br />\nN.L.: It's a cult film.<br />\nEDIE: Yeah. And now it's sellin'<br />\non video tape. So is Female Trouble.<br />\nYou can buy it for sixty-two dollars<br />\nin my store\u2014that's with tax.

A world premiere in<br />\nBaltimore tends to make one stop and<br />\nthink, but fear not, intrepid cowgirls<br />\nand -boys, what is to be seen there is a<br />\ngem: a slice of Americana full of love,<br />\nanger, violence and tenderness, marked<br />\nby solid moments of emotion and genuinely funny one-liners. Like the soail<br />\nOperas it at one point lampoons, it sucks<br />\nyou in.<br />\nThe setting is the home of the Morrow family on the Eastern shore of the<br />\nChesapeake; the house is being sold.<br />\nRay and Delia are retiring to a stucco<br />\nhome in Santa Fe, and have asked their<br />\nchildren to take a last look at the place,<br />\nand, if they wish, to claim some of their<br />\nold things. What ensues is an explosion<br />\nof the passions and confusions that<br />\nmake them a family; tensions are laid<br />\nbare and played out, powered by\u2014<br />\nstrangely enough\u2014the love they all bear<br />\nfor each other.<br />\nStrong performances are given by the<br />\nentire cast. Guy, played by Graham<br />\nBecket, is perhaps the most noteworthy,<br />\ndue in part to the vivacity of his<br />\ncharacter. Loud, outspoken and<br />\noutrageous, he stomps about the scene<br />\nsearching desperately for a love his<br />\nfather never showed him and a closeness<br />\nWith his sister Clair whom he doesn't<br />\nreally understand.<br />\nClair is the opposite of Guy; she<br />\n<br />\nquietly finds solace in Kierkegaard and<br />\nother philosophers and tries to keep up<br />\nwith<br />\nthe present, apparently<br />\ndisinterested in the sorting of memories<br />\ngoing on around her. Lucinda Jenney<br />\n(whom you diehards may recognize as<br />\nthe infamous Janice Rawlings of All My<br />\nChildren) gives a restrained and aptly<br />\nunsettled portrayal in her role.<br />\nThe other sister, Val (Chris<br />\nWeatherhead)takes an energetic role in<br />\nthe proceedings. She sifts and searches<br />\nexcitedly, trying to get the others, including her teenage daughter Mercedes<br />\n(played by Sarah Chodoff), to join in<br />\n<br />\nthe fun. But no one seems interested except her mother (another soap opera vet,<br />\nGloria Cromwell, in a dizzy rendition of<br />\nthe part). Val tries to bury her present<br />\nproblems in her confrontation with the<br />\npast.<br />\nEmery Battis seems a little out of<br />\nplace at first in the part of Ray, but this<br />\nis the fault of the script, which at the<br />\noutset stumbles a bit, trying too hard to<br />\nintroduce and strengthen the characters.<br />\nHis role achieves greater depth as the<br />\nplay develops, and midway through the<br />\nfirst of the three acts, when John Pociccino as Howard Benson (a neighbor who<br />\n<br />\nA coupla white chicks sittin' around tanning:<br />\nVal (Chris Weatherhead) and Clair (Lucinda Jenney)<br />\n<br />\nrts<br />\n<br />\nhad/has designs on Val) appears, a<br />\nsteadily improving play shifts into high<br />\nsear and never_ lets up.<br />\nThe antagonist in all this is an unseen<br />\ncharacter which is itself analyzed at<br />\nsome depth: the past. The entire gathering is a last chance to recover the family of Ray and Delia Morrow that did exist once, but has now separated. It is the<br />\npast that is the basis for the conflicts<br />\nthat arise; it and it alone keeps these<br />\npeople from getting along. There is constant struggle as the children try to<br />\nreconcile their present lives with their_<br />\nresurgent memories. This clash is<br />\nnowhere made more manifest than in<br />\nthe second act, dominated by glowing<br />\nperformances from Beckel, Pociccino<br />\nInd Jenney. A colorful and intricate set<br />\nidds to the impressive reality of the<br />\npiece.<br />\nAn interesting final note to all these<br />\ncharacters is that they rarely divulge<br />\ntheir feelings. What we learn about each<br />\n:omes through the mouths and insights<br />\n3f the other characters. This makes the<br />\nidmissions that are offered by them all<br />\nthe more important and moving. One<br />\nparticular scene that comes to mind is<br />\n:he last, and in a sense the first, tete-atete between Ray and Guy.

Anyone who attended the<br />\nlast game of the season on Sunday knows what I mean. The<br />\nOrioles lost the deciding game<br />\nof the season to give the divisional pennant to the<br />\nMilwaukee Brewers, but very<br />\nfew of the 51,000 fans left early. When the last out was made<br />\nand the Brewers were<br />\ncelebrating on the mound, the<br />\ncrowd began a standing ovation<br />\nfor the O's which lasted for 20<br />\nminutes.<br />\nFirst, the fans called Earl<br />\nWeaver out of the dugout and<br />\nsaid their final goodbyes to the<br />\nretiring manager with shouts of<br />\n\"Wea-ver.\" Then, with 50,000<br />\nfans shouting,\"We want the<br />\nO's,\" the players came out onto the field and the biggest roar<br />\nof the day went up. It just<br />\nshows that what the Orioles did<br />\nthis year\u2014being in last place in<br />\nMay and coming back to have<br />\nthe second highest winning<br />\npercentage in the majors\u2014can<br />\nbe considered only a victory,<br />\nand the fans knew it.<br />\nOn Sept. 30 the Orioles were<br />\nthree games back with four<br />\ngames left to play with the<br />\nBrewers. Their only chance was<br />\n<br />\nto sweep the series.<br />\nIn the first game of a<br />\ndoubleheader Friday, the O's,<br />\nled by Rich Dauer who was 3<br />\nfor 4 with 2 RBIs, blasted 15<br />\nhits to score 8 runs off starter<br />\nPete Vuckovitch and three<br />\nrelievers. The Orioles pitchers,<br />\nstarter Dennis Martinez and 7th<br />\ninning reliever Tippy Martinez,<br />\nscattered 12 hits to hold<br />\nMilwaukee to three runs and<br />\nwin the game 8 to 3.<br />\nThe nightcap was an Oriole<br />\nvictory from the first inning on.<br />\nRookie pitcher Storm Davis<br />\nwent the distance holding the<br />\nBrewers to only one run on 6<br />\nhits. The Oriole batters, meanwhile, bombed Milwaukee<br />\nstarter Mike Caldwell, scoring<br />\n7 runs on 13 hits, including<br />\nhomers by Eddie Murray, Lenn<br />\nSakata, Cal Ripken and rookie<br />\nJohn \"T-Bone\" Shelby, his<br />\nfirst as a major leaguer.<br />\nOn Saturday, the O's continued their shelling of the<br />\nBrewers, accumulating 11 runs<br />\non 18 hits off Milwaukeee pitchers Doc Medich, Moose Haas<br />\nand Dave Bernard. Oriole<br />\nstarter Scott McGregor also<br />\nhad tro,uble and left the game<br />\nin the fourth inning after<br />\nMilwaukee had tied the game<br />\n3-3. Reliever Sammy Stewart<br />\ncame on in outstanding relief<br />\nand shut the Brewers down,<br />\n<br />\nBirds' liackslop<br />\n<br />\nof the season on Sunday to<br />\ndecide the winner. The Orioles'<br />\nonly chance was to get an<br />\noutstanding pitching performance from Jim Palmer, since<br />\nDon Sutton, Milwaukee's best<br />\npitcher, was not likely to give<br />\nup the number of runs his<br />\npredecessors had. But Palmer<br />\ndid not have the excellent stuff<br />\nthat had made him the O's best<br />\npitcher this season, and Robin<br />\nYount hit a solo homerun in the<br />\nfirst inning and repeated it in<br />\nthe third. Cecil Cooper did the<br />\n<br />\n.......<br />\nI ase You- Haven't Heard...<br />\n<br />\nTHE JHU'S RAT IS BACK!!<br />\n11<br />\nMon-Wed<br />\nThurs<br />\nFri<br />\nSat<br />\n<br />\nhe can play either shortstop or<br />\nthird base, but another good infielder is needed \u2022<br />\nErratic pitching has also been<br />\na problem. Jim Palmer, the ace<br />\nof the staff for so many years,<br />\nwill be 37 next year and may<br />\nnot perform as well as in the<br />\npast. Scott McGregor strained<br />\nhis shoulder and was ineffective<br />\nthe last month of the season,<br />\nbut should be able to<br />\nrehabilitate it over the winter.<br />\nSammy Stewart has often asked to be traded and he may be<br />\ngone by spring in exchange for<br />\nan infielder.<br />\nThe biggest question about<br />\nthe Orioles of 1983 is who will<br />\nthe manager be? Cal Ripkin,<br />\nSr., who has been third 'base<br />\ncoach for several years and has<br />\nmanaged the club often during<br />\nRick 1)cinpse.<br />\nEarl's midseason \"vacations,\"<br />\nand pitched well for 2 and 2/3 is the prime candidate.<br />\ninnings giving up one run. The<br />\nWhatever changes are made<br />\nOrioles scored another run in should only add to the solid<br />\nthe eigth inning, but the team already existing to proBrewers put it out of reach in duce pennant contenders<br />\nthe ninth by bombing Dennis another year in Baltimore. On<br />\nMartinez and Mike Flannigan Sunday, when the fans did<br />\nfor five runs to win the game 10 finally leave the stadium, they<br />\nto 2, and to win the pennant by left saddened that a pennant<br />\none game.<br />\nhad not been brought to<br />\nNow that the season is over, Baltimore, but they were<br />\nthe Orioles can work on correc- hopeful for the next year,<br />\nting some of the weaknesses because the Orioles had once<br />\nwhich plagued them this year. again shown that they are one<br />\nCal Ripken, Jr., has shown that of the best teams in baseball.<br />\n<br />\nallowing only 2 hits in 5 and 2/3 same thing in the sixth to knock<br />\ninnings, to win the game 11 to \u2022 Palmer out of the game.

A<br />\ntypical Monday afternoon will<br />\nfind the Hopkins gridders<br />\nworking hard on the field\u2014<br />\nreviewing mistakes and preparing for the upcoming contest.<br />\nBut last Sunday, the films<br />\ndidn't roll. And on the following day, the practice pads remained hung in the team locker<br />\nroom.<br />\nDiscouragement and dejection still hung in the air after<br />\nSaturday's disappointing loss at<br />\nthe hands of the Swarthmore<br />\nQuakers.<br />\nThe Little Quakers came to<br />\nHomewood field boasting the<br />\nbest defense in Division III<br />\nfootball for total yardage and<br />\npoints allowed. Swarthmore<br />\n(3-0) had registered shutouts in<br />\ntheir first two games. Hopkins<br />\nwas looking for their first victory. But as the clock ticked off<br />\nthe final seconds of a 28-10<br />\nscore, Swarthmore had remained unbeaten, and Hopkins was<br />\n'still winless for their 1982<br />\nseason.<br />\nIt was, however, by no<br />\nmeans a pushover for the<br />\nvisiting Quakers. Hopkins<br />\ncame out fired up in the early<br />\ngoing, scoring the first points of<br />\nthe season against the<br />\nSwarthmore defense on their<br />\nopening series of plays. With<br />\nMike Burke platooned to wide<br />\n<br />\nreceiver, freshman quarterback<br />\nMark Campbell responded to<br />\nopening-game honors with a<br />\n58-yard keeper around the left<br />\nside on the second play of their<br />\ndrive. Four plays later, fellow<br />\nclassmate John O'Melia drilled<br />\na 27-yard field goal to put the<br />\nJays up 3-0. After a Swarthmore<br />\npunt, the Hopkins offense<br />\nmoved again, threatening with<br />\na 61-yard drive to the Quaker<br />\n1 yard line, illustrating a sound<br />\n<br />\nrecovered the fumble for a<br />\nHopkins touchdown. O'Melia.<br />\nkicked the extra point and the<br />\n10-0.<br />\nled<br />\nJays<br />\nBut it was all Swarthmore<br />\nafter that.<br />\nHalfback Ed Meehan, racing<br />\n132 yards on the day, began to<br />\ntake things into his own hands.<br />\nMeehan set up the first<br />\nSwarthmore score in the first<br />\nhalf with a combination of<br />\npitch-outs and end sweeps. At<br />\n<br />\nKoscelansky burst up the middle for his second score of the<br />\nday.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense, showing a steady running diet<br />\nthroughout the course of the<br />\ncontest, accumulated 222 yards<br />\non the ground. McLam led the<br />\nway with 80 yards. But the<br />\nJays, harrassed with inconsistency, couldn't seem to come<br />\nup with the big plays. Poor<br />\nfield position and four costly<br />\n<br />\nQB Mark Campbell unloads pass.<br />\n<br />\nrunning attack of Bob Sternfeld<br />\nand freshman Brad McLam.<br />\nBut on a 4th and 1 at the goal<br />\nline, Sternfeld couldn't break<br />\ninto the end zone, and Swarthmore took possession of the<br />\nball. On the ensuing play, the<br />\nBlue Jay defense stacked<br />\nSwarthmore's halfback Ed<br />\nMeehan in their own end zone,<br />\njarring the ball loose. Jay Smith<br />\n<br />\nthe 7:34 mark in the third turnovers plagued the Jays atquarter, Meehan ran for a 25- tack in the second halt'. Coach<br />\nyard touchdown to give Swarth Pfeifer may have summed it up<br />\nmore its first lead at 14-10.

Dr. Farsoun<br />\nwas born in British Palestine<br />\nand grew up in Lebanon.<br />\nFarsoun began by saying that<br />\nthe Lebanon invasion is \"a side<br />\nshow,\" and that the Palestinian<br />\nArabs are the real issue in the<br />\nMiddle East. He also stressed<br />\nthat Lebanon's civil war was an<br />\ninternal conflict, with the<br />\nPalestinian Arabs caught up in<br />\nthe fighting.<br />\nFarsoun pointed out that the<br />\nPLO has been recognized by<br />\n112 nations and has 94 full<br />\ndiplomatic missions. It also has<br />\nUnited Nations observer status.<br />\nFarsoun feels that the PLO is<br />\nthe true representative of the<br />\nPalestinian Arabs through a national parliament in exile and<br />\nvarious \"unions.\" He asserted<br />\nthat it is the U.S. and Israel that<br />\noppose a Palestinian Arab state<br />\nin the West Bank and the Gaza<br />\nStrip. Farsoun also stated that<br /><br />\nIsrael's plan for a greater Eretz<br />\nYisroel (Palestine) included<br />\npart of Syria (the Golan<br />\nHeights), part of Jordan (the<br />\nWest Bank) and Egypt (Sinai<br />\nterritory returned by Israel to<br />\nEgypt under the Camp David<br />\nTreaty).<br />\nHistorically, Dr. Farsoun<br />\nsaid that Palestinian Arabs<br />\nhave lived in Palestine since<br />\nsixth or seventh century A.D.<br />\nHe said it was the rise of<br />\nZionism (the desire for a Jewish<br />\nhomeland in Palestine) in the<br />\nearly twentieth century in<br />\nEurope that set the stage for the<br />\npresent situation.<br />\nThe British and French attempted to carve out ethnic and<br />\nreligious states in the Middle<br />\nEast and partially succeeded,<br />\naccording to Farsoun. He said<br />\nthat is why Lebanon's political<br />\nstructure is so fragile.<br />\nDr. Fa-Noun noted that between 1936 and 1939, Palestinian Arabs revolted against incoming Zionists and the British.<br />\nThis uprising was defeated.<br />\nBy 1945, the population of<br />\nPalestine was one-third Jewish<br />\nas a result of World War II.

Until that time, all films<br />\nwere viewed by the board<br />\nbefore they could be shown in<br />\nMaryland. Under the current<br />\nsystem, a complaint must be<br />\nlodged with the police. According to the Baltimore City<br />\nGeneral Council Division of the<br />\nLaw Department, a determination would be made if the film<br />\nwas obscene. Because of court<br /><br />\nrulings on obscenity laws, the<br />\ndetermination of obscenity<br />\nmust take into account the<br />\nvalues of the community. An<br />\nexample cited by the division is<br />\nthat a film that was declared<br />\nobscene on Broadway may be<br />\ndeclared not obscene when<br />\nshown at the \"Block\".<br />\nAccording to the Baltimore<br />\nPolice Department Vice Division, since Deep Throat was<br />\nruled obscene in Baltimore in<br />\n1974, the police would have no<br />\nchoice but to raid the film.<br /><br />\nto partition Palestine into a<br />\nJewish state, Israel, and an<br />\nArab state, Palestine. Farsoun<br />\ntermed this action \"gerrymandering.\" (This is the<br />\npractice of drawing boundaries<br />\nfor political goals without<br />\nregard to public benefit.) Farsoun said that the Palestinian<br />\nArabs were not consulted on<br />\nthis matter.<br />\nIn May 1948, during the first<br />\nArab-Israeli war, Jordan occupied the West Bank and<br />\nEgypt took the Gaza strip.<br />\nThey held these areas until<br />\n1967, when they were taken by<br />\nIsrael.<br /><br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nThe new wing, designed by<br />\nthe Philadelphia firm of Bower<br />\nLewis Thrower/Architects,<br />\ncomplements the original neoclassical building of 1929 by using limestone to match the<br />\noriginal facade.

Eisenhower<br />\nlit his lamppost several nights a week and<br />\nbetween five and fifteen students attended<br />\nnightly. Through events such as this, the<br />\npresident was able to achieve an understanding of student concerns,<br />\nIn recent years, many students have complained that President Muller is never seen<br />\non campus. A standard joke is that as a student you get to meet the president twice:<br />\nonce, when he shakes your hand at orientation and again at graduation when you<br />\nrecieve your diploma. For most students this<br />\nis true. One of the reasons for Muller's lack<br />\nof contact with students is that he has many<br />\ntime consuming commitments. He is the first<br />\nUniversity president to also be the president<br />\nof Johns Hopkins Hospital. His involvements with the Federal Reserve Bank<br /><br />\nof Richmond and various organizations dealing with higher education also place constraints on his time. It is not surprising that<br />\nhe has little time to spend with<br />\nundergraduates.;<br />\nLast Thursday,however, many students<br />\nreceived a surprise. Muller, accompanied by<br />\nStudent Council President Doug Fel'man,<br />\nspent an hour touring the campus. His walk,<br />\nwhich took him to such places as Levering<br />\nHall and the Gilman mail room gave him an<br />\nopportunity to meet students and discuss<br />\ntheir problems and concerns. We do not<br />\nknow if Muller intends to take these walks<br />\nregularly but it would certainly. be-a good<br />\nidea for both students and the president.. It<br />\nallows Muller to get a better understanding<br />\nof students and this is important if he gets<br />\ninvolved with undergraduate education.<br />\nStudents should not expect Muller to invite<br />\nstudents to watch television with him; he<br />\ndoes not even live in Nichols House. Yet by<br />\ncontinuing activities such as his campus<br />\nwalks he is taking an important step to increase interaction between undergraduates<br />\nand himself.<br /><br />\nArt Museum Membership<br />\nUntil several months ago,admission to the<br />\nBaltimore Museum Of Art was t'ree.<br />\nHowever, with the implementation of an admission fee, the Museum also established a<br />\npolicy by which college students could visit<br />\nthe Museum free of charge if the college took<br />\nout an official membership. So far Hopkins<br />\nhas taken no action although negotiations<br />\nare in process.<br />\nHopkins students have failed to take advantage of the Art Museum despite its proximity to the campus. Now that admission<br />\nis being charged, student attendance will likely diminish even further. A two or three<br />\ndollar charge may be prohibitive to someone<br />\nwho only wishes to spend a few minutes<br />\nbrowsing at paintings. A University member-<br /><br />\nship would at least prevent a decline in student interest and attendance. The cost of<br />\nmembership is meager, less than 400 dollars.<br />\nGoucher College and the Maryland Institute<br />\nof Art have already taken advantage of this<br />\nopportunity. There is no excuse for Hopkins<br />\nto delay its membership. It is something that<br />\npopularity and common sense would mandate anyway.<br />\nHopkins has failed to encourage student<br />\ninterest in the Art Museum. The Art History<br />\ndepartment, for instance, should consider<br />\nholding classes in the museum. However, a<br />\nfirst step for the University should be to take.<br />\nout a museum membership as soon as possible so that Hopkins students can visit the<br />\nMuseum free of charge.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nCharm City Is The One That Receives The Unfair Advantages<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe article \"Lapides<br />\nDiscusses Issues\" in your issue<br />\nof 24 September states that the<br />\ncurrent system of educational<br />\nsubsidies in Maryland \"gives<br />\nthe children of the wealthier<br />\nsuburbs an unfair advantage<br />\nover children from poorer<br />\ndistricts...\" My heart would<br />\nbleed more for Baltimore City,<br />\npresumably one of the<br />\n\"poorer\" jurisdictions, if the<br />\nfacts did not show that \"Charm<br />\nCity\" receives an unfair subsidy<br />\nat the expense of smaller<br />\ndistricts. Using figures released by the<br /><br />\nState of Maryland for the last<br />\nfiscal year for which I could obtain such figures, let us compare the budget of the City of<br />\nBaltimore with those of two<br /><br />\ntypical Maryland counties,<br />\nFrederick and Montomery,<br />\nneither of which has experienced anything like Baltimore's<br />\n\"urban renaissance.\" In fiscal<br />\nyear 1978, Frederick County<br />\nhad to raise 53.2 percent of its<br />\nbudget from local revenues;<br />\nMontgomery, 75 percent. Certainly, neither of these counties<br />\nreceived undue cash at the expense of Baltimore City, which<br />\nhad to raise a piddling 33.1 percent of its budget from local<br />\nrevenues. Moreover, \"poor\"<br />\nBalt-imore somehow managed<br />\nto afford a FY '78 budget of<br />\n$1,767 per capita, well over<br />\nMontgomery's $1,066 and<br />\nmore than double Frederick's<br />\n$778. We can easily see why<br />\nboth Frederick and Montgomery oppose giving extra<br />\nmoney to Baltifinote.<br /><br />\nNor has Baltimore City<br />\nstrained itself to provide education funds. In FY '78,<br />\nBaltimore City coughed up only 21.1 percent of its bloated<br />\nbudget for education, a negligible amount compared to Montgomery's 49.0 percent and<br />\nFrederick's 51.7 percent.<br />\nIndeed, one state legislator<br />\nhas estimated that Montgomery<br />\nCounty receives only 27 cents in<br />\nstate services for every dollar it<br />\nsends to Annapolis in state<br />\ntaxes. Moreover, Baltimore,<br />\nwith its vast industrial base and<br />\nits excellent port, uses its huge<br />\nblock of Annapolis votes to extort money from more rural<br />\ncounties. So who has an \"unfair advantage\" over whom?<br /><br />\nSincerely,<br />\nDavid J. Edmondson<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nChaplain's Office Deserves Praise For Fairness<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWe are writing in response to<br />\nyour article concerning the<br />\nJSA's objection to the programs sponsored by the<br />\nChaplain on the Middle East.<br />\nTo quote the News-Letter ,<br />\n\"The JSA objected because the<br />\nprogram was scheduled before<br />\nthe beginning of Yom Kippur.\"<br />\nWhy then the fuss? If the argument behind the JSA's criticism<br />\nof the Chaplain was to have the<br />\nprogram re-scheduled in order<br />\nto allow more JSA members to<br />\nattend, it is a weak one. For<br />\nwhen the JSA itself sponsored<br />\nthe Israeli Vice-Consul (on a<br />\nThursday night, presumably a<br />\ntime at which many JSA<br />\nmembers could be present), attendance was poor. Moreover,<br />\n\"many Jewish students came to<br />\nthe program and apparently did<br />\nnot feel the scheduling was unfair.\" It would appear that in<br />\nhis zeal, the president of the<br />\nJSA overlooked this somewhat<br />\nimportant point.<br />\nFurthermore, we find it objectionable that the JSA has<br />\ntried to interfere with the<br />\nChaplain's Office activities.<br />\nHow would the JSA like to see<br />\nother campus groups interfere<br />\nwith their activities?<br />\nThe Chaplain's Office is an<br />\nautonomous organization<br />\nunder no obligation to enter into any \"agreement\" with the<br />\nJSA, if it wishes otherwise. The<br />\nChaplain's Office is by no<br />\nmeans responsible to the JSA<br />\nand can \"violate\" any \"agreement\" that would limit its<br />\nfreedom of action.<br />\nIt is also offending to have<br />\nthe JSA depict the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice as an organization that<br />\nsponsors solely \"leftist rallies.\"<br />\n(Shades of red baiting?) It is<br />\neven more incredible that the<br />\nJSA objected to the Chaplain's<br />\nprogram as \"biased,\" even<br />\nthough it had not yet been<br />\npresented and despite the fact<br />\nthat the Chaplain was sponsoring a pro-Israeli speaker the upcoming week!<br />\nWe attended Professor Farsoun's presentation and found<br />\n(to our own surprise!) that he<br />\nwas in fact quite moderate. We<br />\nalso recall that Seth Kaye(who<br />\ndespite his objections, was able<br />\nto come) did not criticize the<br />\nprofessor or have much to say.<br />\nIn comparison, the Israeli viceconsul (or the A1PAC speaker<br /><br />\nsponsored by the JSA last year<br />\nat the height of the AWACS<br />\ncontroversy) could hardly be<br />\ncalled objective. It is not that<br />\nwe mind the bias of the JSA<br />\nspeakers. On the contrary, it is<br />\ninevitable in so polarized an<br />\nissue. What we do object to is<br />\nSeth Kaye's insistence that any<br />\nopposing opinions are illegitimate (\"biased\" is a nicer<br />\nway of putting it). In the interest of education, both sides<br />\nmust be presented. The<br />\nChaplain's Office should be<br />\npraised for having done so.<br />\nIn conclusion, a balanced<br />\nview on the Middle East should<br />\nbe defined as a pro-Palestinian<br />\nspeaker for every pro-Israeli<br />\nspeaker. To demand that the<br />\nChaplain's Office show only<br />\none side of such a crucial topic<br />\nis pure arrogance.<br />\nCyril Guillot<br />\nGuy Wiggins<br />\nPeter Guattery<br />\n.lean Preston<br /><br />\nAbsentee Ballots<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nA new school year is just getting under way and a new opportunity is available for<br />\nstudents to make their voices<br />\nheard on critical isues that will<br />\naffect their lives.

KARRAS<br />\nThe recent proliferation of<br />\ncampus groups that are concerned with more than their immediate surroundings is to be<br />\ncommended. Increasing student<br />\nenthusiasm and activism in the<br />\nworld outside the university's<br />\ngates deserves our praise and<br />\nsupport. People at Hopkins<br />\nhave finally realized that things<br />\nother than exam grades are<br />\nworth fighting for. Off-campus<br />\ncauses such as nuclear disarmament, pro-choice, pro-life, and<br />\nnumerous others are important<br />\nissues with lasting implications,<br />\nand with which national<br />\nlegislators are currently grappling. Hopkins students are<br />\norganizing around these issues<br />\nto promote awareness and<br />\ncreate concern within (and<br />\nwithout) the<br />\nuniversity<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nBy the same token, groups<br />\nsuch as the Nuclear Freeze<br />\nGroup or Students for Social<br />\nResponsibility should not be<br /><br />\nchartered as SACAponsored these frameworks, provided the<br />\nnly when it has been<br />\norganizations.

The attendance, net profit, and number of problems<br />\nare all factors in determining<br />\nthe success of a movie, and<br />\nDebbie Does Dallas had the<br />\nhighest attendance and profit of<br />\nany film last year, and virtually no problems other than a bit<br />\nmore attention from local<br />\nmedia (because of UMBC)than<br />\nwe cared for.<br />\nWe were not asked at any<br />\ntime to get our schedule approved, and since this had not<br />\nbeen done in the past, we<br />\nfollowed custom and decided<br />\non the merits of each film<br />\nourselves. Furthermore, the only request we had was from the<br />\nSAC Office\u2014not to schedule<br />\nany X-rated movie for Parents'<br />\nWeekend, since that had been<br />\ndone originally last year.<br />\nBecause of objections from<br />\ncertain groups, Chris Colombo<br />\nadvised the Senior Class officers not to show Deep Throat.<br />\nWe maintained that the problems caused by cancelling the<br />\nmovie outweighed the possible<br />\nproblems and hassles caused by<br />\na decision made against our<br />\nbest judgement, we stated that<br />\nwe would resign if the movie<br />\nwere cancelled.<br />\nThe Senior Class officers<br />\nfinally decided to show the<br />\nfilm, and everything settled<br />\ndown\u2014for a few days. Then<br />\nthe officers talked to Chris Colombo again and were told that<br /><br />\nthere was a chance that the vice<br />\nsquad could come to campus,<br />\nimpound the film, and arrest<br />\npeople associated with the film.<br />\nThe same chance existed last<br />\nyear, but the Senior Class officers were informed by the vice<br />\nsquad, very unofficially, that<br />\nnothing would happen.<br />\nRegardless, this year the class<br />\nofficers reversed their previous<br />\ndecision and decided to cancel<br />\nthe movie. In order to keep the<br />\nfilm, we had to try to get confirmation of last year's handsoff policy of the vice squad. It<br />\nturned out that the only way to<br />\nget such a confirmation was to<br />\ntalk to the vice squad. But this<br />\ntime they gave no such<br />\nassurance; rather, they said that<br />\nthey would quite possibly raid.<br />\nThis was probably due to the<br />\nfact that Deep Throat had<br />\nalready been declared obscene<br />\nby the courts, so that they could<br />\nhardly approve of us showing<br />\nit.

These two<br />\ncomputers, located in Barton<br />\nHall, are complemented by the<br />\nthree computers in the basement of Garland Hall. The administrative tasks occupy the<br />\ntime of the two smaller computers, while the IBM 4341<br />\nserves as the workhorse for student computation.<br />\nThe 4341 is quite new to<br />\nHopkins, replacing a less<br />\npowerful DEC System 10, only five to six months ago.

A shelf along the left wall<br />\nhas about a dozen mannaquin heads<br />\nsitting, disembodied, in a sort of<br />\ntribunal row (they also remind one of<br />\nthe completely hairless, caricaturish<br />\nface of Divine); above these, the mirrored wall is plastered with<br />\nRockshots, the greeting cards which<br />\nfeature Edie's series of six called<br />\n.\"Edie the Egg Lady Goes<br />\nRockshots.\" One of these, captioned \"Season's Beatings,\" shows Edie<br />\nin her famous leather outfit holding<br />\na whip over a cringing Santa Claus.<br />\nCards dominate a good part of the<br />\nstore; there are racks on both sides<br />\nand swivel racks in the middle,<br />\nfeaturing, besides Rockshots, movie<br /><br />\nstar cards and joke celebrity cards,<br />\nportraying Ronald Reagan picking<br />\nhis nose, Nancy snorting cocaine.<br />\nEven with a varied assortment of<br />\nclothing,<br />\nmerchandise\u2014wigs,<br />\nposters, books, records, bottle<br />\nopeners, cigarette lighters, twisted<br />\npencils, costume jewelry\u2014the store<br />\ntranscends being a junk shop; it is a<br />\nveritable flea-market, and it reflects<br />\nthe varied tastes of Edith Massey.<br />\nThe following interview with Edie<br />\ntakes place on a pleasant afternoon<br />\noutside her store. People occasionally stop by to say hello to Edie<br />\nor have her sign a card, and at first<br />\nwe're slightly bothered by bees. We<br />\nhave to wait a few moments while<br />\nEdie applies some lipstick. She's<br />\nwearing a loose flowered dress, and<br />\ntoday she's a brunette.<br />\nEDIE: The record's doin' real<br />\ngood.<br />\nN.L.: What's the name of the<br />\nrecord?<br />\nEDIE: \"Big Birls Don't Cry\" and<br />\n\"Punks, Get off the Grass.\" I wrote<br />\nthe words to \"Punks, Get off the<br />\nGrass,\" and the music was done by,<br />\nyou know, a band.<br />\nN.L.: The name of the band is<br />\nEdie and the Eggs?<br />\nEDIE: No, no. The band I had<br />\nwas\u2014well, Steve Longo wrote the<br />\nmusic, and they had the studio band<br />\nwith Steve Longo, you know. I don't<br />\nknow, they can call me any\u2014I don't<br />\nknow what they call me, but... I was<br />\ntwo months in California; I did about<br />\nfive theaters in promotion; was in<br />\nfront of about three hundred<br />\nD.J.'s\u2014with Chaka Khan, she was<br />\nthere, and a wonderful group\u2014one<br />\nof the girls was with the Supremes at<br />\none time.<br />\nN.L.: Diana Ross!<br />\nEDIE: Not Diana Ross.<br />\nN.L.: Oh.<br />\nEDIE: Another girl; can you<br />\nname...Well, I wouldn't<br />\nremember. But anyway, they were<br />\ngreat.<br />\nN.L.: Is this the first record you've<br />\ncut?<br />\nEDIE: A bee, a bee! Ha, ha. This<br />\nis the first record, yeah. Well, the<br />\nkids were yellin;, \"Why don't you<br />\nmake a record?\" and I was at the<br />\nWhiskey Go-Go in California\u2014did<br />\nyou ever hear of it?.and somebody<br />\nhad told them to come and see me,<br />\nyou know, and they liked me.<br />\nN.L.: Terrific. So, how long have<br />\nyou been singing?<br /><br />\nEDIE: Well, it's not really singing;<br />\nI perform.<br />\nN.L.: I'm sorry, how long\u2014<br />\nEDIE: God, I don't realize\u2014<br />\nabout, maybe, ten years. It doesn't<br />\nseem that long, but\u2014bees, gonna<br />\nworry us to death.<br />\nN.L.: Worries the hell outa me.<br />\nEDIE: Worries it outa me, too. So,<br />\nI did a show at the Club Lingerie, and<br />\nI did it with tapes\u2014you know, instrumental tapes. And I sing to it.<br />\nAnd I did it at the One Way\u2014see,<br />\nI'm learning how to sing with tapes,<br />\nthe instrumental tapes. And, well, it<br />\nkeeps the cost down, I guess. What<br />\nelse...<br />\nN.L.: Where did you grow up\u2014<br />\nhere?<br />\nEDIE: Well, no. I was born in New<br />\nYork, raised in Denver, Colorado;<br />\nduring the second world war I was in<br />\nSan Francisco; during the Korean<br />\nwar I was in Seattle\u2014it seems that's<br />\nall I do, travel.<br />\nN.L.: When did you locate here?<br />\nEDIE: Well, I used to be a barmaid in Florida, and I used to have<br />\ngirls workin' as B-girls out, you<br />\nknow, so I figured I'd go where my<br />\nmoney is, the tips off the B-girls... I<br />\ncame here. These girls say they have<br />\na block here, so I worked on the<br />\nblock here about thirteen, fourteen<br />\nyears.<br />\nN.L.: As a barmaid?<br />\nEDIE: Barmaid, glamour-girl...<br />\n[Confidentially] But I was only a<br />\nglamour-girl once.<br />\nN.L.: Ah hah.<br /><br />\nN.L.: Oh, certainly.<br />\nEDIE: I hope, I hope.<br />\nN.L.: I think you look adorable<br />\njust the way you are.<br />\nEDIE: Really?<br />\nN.L.: Yeah.<br />\nEDIE: Thank you. Well, that's<br />\ncause you like me.<br />\nN.L.: When did you meet John?<br />\nEDIE: Oh, gee. I met John, like\u2014<br />\nit was the seventies; it was right across<br />\nthe street, over there, called Pete's<br />\nHotel-Bar. Right? And I became the<br />\nbarmaid. See, I been on the block a<br />\nlong time. And, you know, you feel<br />\nyou're gettin' older and all the other<br />\nglamour-girls are comin' down... So<br />\nI thought, you know, I'd get a regular<br />\njob, so I got a job right there. First<br />\nthere were only two hippies there;<br />\nbefore the year was over I had made<br />\nso much work for myself, you<br />\nknow... I don't know what it is, but<br />\nwhat have I got that they like? Well,<br />\nI don't know what it is. Did you ever<br />\nread John's book?<br />\nN.L.: No, I haven't gotten around<br />\nto it yet.<br />\nEDIE: You should, it's fun. We<br />\nsold over three hundred copies, you<br />\nknow. Well, he tells everybody\u2014I<br />\ncould kill him!\u2014but he tells<br />\neverybody how I talk... You know,<br />\nI'm easy to get bored. That's why<br />\ntraveling's good for me. I have a<br />\nhabit\u2014I look at all the signs and I<br />\nrepeat 'em, you know, like on the<br />\nhighway? I say\u2014I repeat it, if it says<br />\nGOOD WINE, I'll say \"Good<br />\nwine,\" or something\u2014whatever it<br /><br />\nasso**100-\"\"i''''<br />\nNM.<br /><br />\n*********<br /><br />\n.<br />\ndos,****40IMAsk<br /><br />\nEDIE: You, know, people who<br />\nwrite about me a lot of times hurt my<br />\nFeelings, because they expect that I<br />\nshould be looking like I did twenty,<br />\nthirty years ago. I don't know why...<br />\nN.L.: How old are you? Do you<br />\nmind\u2014<br />\nEDIE: Old enough to know better,<br />\n_,oung enough to resist. And you<br />\nknow I'm gettin' on anyway\u2014John<br />\nsays I can get some teeth.<br />\nN.L.: Oh, why?<br />\nEDIE: For the next movie.<br />\nN.L.: Really?<br />\nEDIE: Yeah, so I'm gonna get<br />\nsome. So I should look at least ten<br />\nyears younger.<br /><br />\nFeatu res<br /><br />\nsays... it's jusi a habit.<br />\nN.L.:' So. You met John\u2014were<br />\nyou working for John?<br />\nEDIE: Oh. See, I'm a Gemini\u2014<br />\nwe'd better straighten this out\u2014I'm<br />\na Gemini, and I will talk about one<br />\nthing and then my mind wanders and<br />\nI start something else, so you're gonna have to get me back on the right<br />\ntrack.<br />\nN.L.: That's all right.<br />\nEDIE: 1 don't know why.[To the<br />\nN.L. photographer] What sign are<br />\ny_ou?<br />\nN.L. PHOTOGRAPHER: Libra.<br />\nEDIE: Libra.<br />\nN.L.: He looks like a Libra,<br />\ndoesn't he?<br />\nEDIE: Ha, ha, I don't know, but<br />\nhe's faithful; Libras are faithful,<br />\nmake good husbands. What about<br />\nyou?<br />\nN.L.: I'm...pretty faithful.<br />\nEDIE: What sign are you?<br />\nN.L.: Oh. Aries.<br />\nEDIE: I don't know\u2014you're hairy,<br />\nall right, but I don't know...<br />\nN.L.: Aries.<br />\nEDIE: Aries. What's that?<br />\nN.L.: The ram.<br /><br />\nA Different Kind of Bag Lady<br />\nEDIE: The ram, but I don't know<br />\nnothin' about you. I'll be honest. I<br />\njust know\u2014if I have a boyfriend, one<br />\nwas a Libra, and, you know, when<br />\nI was younger I kind of read a little<br />\nbut... they say I'm five different<br />\nwomen on the weekend.<br />\nN.L.: Okay. So, you met John<br />\nacross the street.<br />\nEDIE: Right there, and I had<br />\nseventy, eighty, a hundred people to<br />\nwait on on the weekends. But the kids<br />\nwere really great; they always helped<br />\nme, they helped me at the bar, they<br />\nhelped wait on people. The kids from<br />\ncollege used to come down and take<br />\nme home every night; they were<br />\ngreat.<br />\nN.L.: Terrific. So when .did John<br />\ndecide to put you in his movies?<br />\nEDIE: Well, they were makin'<br />\nMultiple Maniacs, and he asked<br />\nwould I play Jesus' mother; and, you<br />\nknow, who knows what Jesus'<br />\nmother looked like?<br />\nN.L.: The Virgin Mary.<br />\nEDIE: Yeah.<br />\nN.L.: That must've been a fun<br />\npart.<br /><br />\n\"I didn't ever care<br />\nfor Frank Sinatra.<br />\nJohn said in his<br />\nbook, 'Who would<br />\nyou like to go eat<br />\nwith?' I didn't say<br />\nFrankie. I said Bob<br />\nBarker.\"<br />\nEDIE: And then also being I worked there he gave me\u2014he liked, I<br />\nguess, what I did, so he have me the<br />\nRat-Fink Barmaid.<br />\nN.L.: Another picture?<br />\nEDIE: Same picture. You see,<br />\nJesus' mother had sheets all over her,<br />\nso the other part I had furs, and a<br />\nbunch of...<br />\nN.L.: You never acted before that?<br />\nEDIE: No.<br />\nN.L.: How did you find acting?<br />\nEDIE: Oh, I liked it. Well, I laughed at first. I told my brother, \"I'm<br />\nin a movie; you ought to come see<br />\nit.\" I said you have to be sick to see<br />\nit. He's a criminologist. So he came<br />\nand he loved it\u2014he just loved it; he<br />\nlaughed and laughed.<br />\nN.L.: What came after Multiple<br />\nManiacs?<br />\nEDIE: Pink Flamingos, Female<br />\nTrouble, Desperate Living\u2014then Bob<br />\nMyers, who helps with the movies, he<br />\nmade the story A Love-Letter to<br />\nEdie, that's in the Pratt Library. It's<br />\nnice\u2014you ought to go see it\u2014it's in<br />\ncolor and everything. He did a nice<br />\njob. Then Polyester. And we're gonna do a new movie. I'm gonna be a<br />\nShakespearean actress and a<br />\nShakespeare teacher. And Divine\u2014<br />\nthis is as far as I know now\u2014Divine<br />\nis gonna be triplets.<br />\nN.L.: In one?<br />\nEDIE: Yeah, in the same movie<br />\nshe's gonna be triplets. John's writing<br />\nit now; it might change, you know.<br />\nN.L.: Okay. Now I only saw Pink<br />\nFlamingos\u2014I loved Pink Flamingos,<br />\njust loved it. Then I saw part of<br />\n.Female Trouble, but my girlfriend<br />\nwanted to walk out, so...<br /><br />\nEDIE: Wonder why she walked<br />\n,out? She should've just laughed at it,,<br />\nbecause it ain't really nothin', you<br />\n,know. There's a few things that I<br />\ndon't like in John's movies, but I put<br />\nmy head down. I wouldn't want a lot<br />\nof that stuff to really happen, but\u2014<br />\nwho eats people? I mean there's people who have done it\u2014I read about<br />\n'em, you know?<br />\nN.L.: Right.<br />\nEDIE: But who goes ahead and<br />\neats the bones and stuff\u2014you know<br />\nit ain't true. Like even me in<br />\nDesperate Living, I have all these<br />\nlovers, but I don't think\u2014close it off'<br />\nand I'll tell you.<br />\n[Tape is shut]<br />\nKids'd think I was terrible if I say<br />\nanything rough\u2014too rough.<br />\n\"Pun<br />\nGet off the Grass.\"<br />\nEverybody likes that one. It goes like<br />\nthis:<br />\nPunks like you just blow my mind<br />\nYou're all just one of a kind<br />\nCoin' nowhere real fast<br />\nThen the music stops and I say:<br />\nHey, punks, get off the grass!<br />\nI made it up, you know, the words.<br />\nEvery so often I make up the words<br />\nto different things. But music I don't<br />\nknow nothin' about. I'm gettin' to<br />\nlearn by gettin' to know a certain<br />\nsound, you know... \"I Need a Man,\"<br />\nI do, and \"Fever,\" with Sophie<br />\nTucker mixed in. You know:<br />\nI can do anything a better girl can<br />\n(IL)<br />\nAnd if a great big mama like me<br />\ncan do it<br />\nWhy in the hell can't you?<br />\nWhat else do I sing? I do:<br />\nYou don't have to be a glamourpuss or beauty queen,<br />\nI'm better in my fifties<br />\nThan I was at sweet sixteen<br />\nWhat has age got to do with it? Age<br />\nis only a number. The way I feel, you<br />\nknow... Somebody might say,<br />\n\"What do you want with' that old<br />\nbag?\" you know, but other people<br />\nsay kids like me.<br />\nN.L.: Oh, everybody I know who<br />\nhas seen your movies likes you.<br />\nEDIE: Yeah Loves me.<br />\nN.L.: That impish smile...<br />\nED1E: Yeah. Toothless smile\u2014but<br />\nI'm gonna have teeth nice like yours.<br />\nThe progress of the interview is<br />\nhalted a couple of times, once when<br />\nEdie signs a few cards for someone,<br />\nand later when she has the NewsLetter photographer run to the<br />\nmarket to buy some ham so she can<br />\nfeed a cat lounging by the curb. Edie<br />\nsays: \"I love animals, so if I act ickyicky, don't pay no attention to it. I'<br />\nlike cats and dogs.\" She has a dog<br />\nand three cats in her home, and she<br />\nregularly feeds at least seven cats on<br />\nthe street.<br />\nThe person who has Edie sign the<br />\ngreeting cards turns to us and asks:<br />\n\"Is this for the Hopkins underground<br />\npaper?\"<br />\n\"No,\" we tell him.<br />\nN.L.: Edie, one thing I didn't get<br />\nstraight: What name do you go by<br />\nwhen you sing?<br />\nEDIE: Edith Massey.<br />\nN.L.: And you sing with different<br />\npeople? You're not in a particular<br />\nband?<br />\nEDIE: Yeah, I sing with different<br />\npeople. What I do ain't hard.<br />\nBecause, like anything I do\u2014I was in<br />\nCanada once, and I didn't have no<br /><br />\nband because my promoter spent the<br />\nmoney. And I didn't know I had to go,<br />\nand they called me up, \"Are you<br />\ncomin'?\" and I said I have no band,<br />\nI didn't know nothin' about it. Well<br />\nanyway, so they got me a band when<br />\nI got up there, I practiced an hour<br />\nand half with them, and we played<br />\nthree nights in a row like we been<br />\nthere together for twenty years. They<br />\nwere so good, the band. And they<br />\nsaid they loved it, you know. Then<br />\nI was more punky, too. I was tellin'<br />\nthem, \"Go strangle yourselves,<br />\npunks.\" They said,\"Oh, Edie, you're<br />\nbeautiful. I love you Edie.\" And<br />\nI said, \"Go strangle yourselves.\"<br />\nAnd some of'em would be hurl. But<br />\nit was all in fun. But lately I've been<br />\nthrowin' eggs, and stuff like that.<br />\nN.L.: Okay. Since you mention the<br />\neggs, when did \"Edie the Egg Lady\"<br />\nstart? That was in Pink Flamingos.<br />\nEDIE: Yeah. I can't lose it,<br />\nbecause Pink Flamingos plays<br />\nconstantly.<br />\nN.L.: Yes. So it just stuck because<br />\nof the movie?<br />\nEDIE: Oh, I don't care. I eat eggs<br />\nanyway.<br />\nN.L.: You like eggs?<br />\nEDIE: Yeah, in the morning I eat<br />\na couple of eggs.<br />\nN.L.: What about the Eggman?<br />\nEDIE: He's nice. I don't know. I'd<br />\nfall for you and him [N.L.<br />\nPhotographer] before the Eggman.<br />\nN.L.: Were you ever married,<br />\nEdie?<br />\nEDIE: Yeah. That's my husband's<br />\nname I use, Massey.<br />\nN.L.: Did you have any children?<br />\nED1E: No. Well, I helped raise a<br /><br />\ncouple; they're like my kids. And I<br />\ngot nothin' but children now. What<br />\nmore do I need? I'm like the old lady<br />\nin the shoe; she got so many children<br />\nshe don't know what to do. That's<br />\nme.<br />\nN.L.: Are you friendly with the<br />\n(other people in the films?<br />\nEDIE: Oh, sure. And the gay people love me, whiA makes me happy,<br />\nyou know. And they voted me<br />\nonce\u2014I don't remember what<br />\npaper\u2014they voted me one of the ten<br />\nmost liked of the gay community. I<br />\nthought that was nice.<br />\nN.L.: When I saw Pink Flamingos,<br />\nyou were the star as far as everyone<br />\nwatching was concerned; everyone<br />\napplauded more for you than for<br />\nDivine.<br />\nEDIE: Say that again.<br />\nN.L.: It's true. I saw the movie<br />\nthree years ago. It was a wild<br />\nexperience\u2014everyone was really into the movie.<br />\nEDIE: Yeah, you know, I don't<br />\nunderstand but there's some kids<br />\nseem' it and seem' it; they can say<br />\nevery word there is, repeat every<br />\nword there is in the movie.<br />\nN.L.: It's a cult film.<br />\nEDIE: Yeah. And now it's sellin'<br />\non video tape. So is Female Trouble.<br />\nYou can buy it for sixty-two dollars<br />\nin my store\u2014that's with tax. And I<br />\nmake cards for, you know,<br />\nRockshots.<br />\nN.L.: Oh, they're very cute.<br />\nEDIE: I look like an egg.

A world premiere in<br />\nBaltimore tends to make one stop and<br />\nthink, but fear not, intrepid cowgirls<br />\nand -boys, what is to be seen there is a<br />\ngem: a slice of Americana full of love,<br />\nanger, violence and tenderness, marked<br />\nby solid moments of emotion and genuinely funny one-liners. Like the soail<br />\nOperas it at one point lampoons, it sucks<br />\nyou in.<br />\nThe setting is the home of the Morrow family on the Eastern shore of the<br />\nChesapeake; the house is being sold.<br />\nRay and Delia are retiring to a stucco<br />\nhome in Santa Fe, and have asked their<br />\nchildren to take a last look at the place,<br />\nand, if they wish, to claim some of their<br />\nold things. What ensues is an explosion<br />\nof the passions and confusions that<br />\nmake them a family; tensions are laid<br />\nbare and played out, powered by\u2014<br />\nstrangely enough\u2014the love they all bear<br />\nfor each other.<br />\nStrong performances are given by the<br />\nentire cast. Guy, played by Graham<br />\nBecket, is perhaps the most noteworthy,<br />\ndue in part to the vivacity of his<br />\ncharacter. Loud, outspoken and<br />\noutrageous, he stomps about the scene<br />\nsearching desperately for a love his<br />\nfather never showed him and a closeness<br />\nWith his sister Clair whom he doesn't<br />\nreally understand.<br />\nClair is the opposite of Guy; she<br /><br />\nquietly finds solace in Kierkegaard and<br />\nother philosophers and tries to keep up<br />\nwith<br />\nthe present, apparently<br />\ndisinterested in the sorting of memories<br />\ngoing on around her. Lucinda Jenney<br />\n(whom you diehards may recognize as<br />\nthe infamous Janice Rawlings of All My<br />\nChildren) gives a restrained and aptly<br />\nunsettled portrayal in her role.<br />\nThe other sister, Val (Chris<br />\nWeatherhead)takes an energetic role in<br />\nthe proceedings. She sifts and searches<br />\nexcitedly, trying to get the others, including her teenage daughter Mercedes<br />\n(played by Sarah Chodoff), to join in<br /><br />\nthe fun. But no one seems interested except her mother (another soap opera vet,<br />\nGloria Cromwell, in a dizzy rendition of<br />\nthe part). Val tries to bury her present<br />\nproblems in her confrontation with the<br />\npast.<br />\nEmery Battis seems a little out of<br />\nplace at first in the part of Ray, but this<br />\nis the fault of the script, which at the<br />\noutset stumbles a bit, trying too hard to<br />\nintroduce and strengthen the characters.<br />\nHis role achieves greater depth as the<br />\nplay develops, and midway through the<br />\nfirst of the three acts, when John Pociccino as Howard Benson (a neighbor who<br /><br />\nA coupla white chicks sittin' around tanning:<br />\nVal (Chris Weatherhead) and Clair (Lucinda Jenney)<br /><br />\nrts<br /><br />\nhad/has designs on Val) appears, a<br />\nsteadily improving play shifts into high<br />\nsear and never_ lets up.<br />\nThe antagonist in all this is an unseen<br />\ncharacter which is itself analyzed at<br />\nsome depth: the past. The entire gathering is a last chance to recover the family of Ray and Delia Morrow that did exist once, but has now separated. It is the<br />\npast that is the basis for the conflicts<br />\nthat arise; it and it alone keeps these<br />\npeople from getting along. There is constant struggle as the children try to<br />\nreconcile their present lives with their_<br />\nresurgent memories. This clash is<br />\nnowhere made more manifest than in<br />\nthe second act, dominated by glowing<br />\nperformances from Beckel, Pociccino<br />\nInd Jenney. A colorful and intricate set<br />\nidds to the impressive reality of the<br />\npiece.<br />\nAn interesting final note to all these<br />\ncharacters is that they rarely divulge<br />\ntheir feelings. What we learn about each<br />\n:omes through the mouths and insights<br />\n3f the other characters. This makes the<br />\nidmissions that are offered by them all<br />\nthe more important and moving. One<br />\nparticular scene that comes to mind is<br />\n:he last, and in a sense the first, tete-atete between Ray and Guy. What we are<br />\nleft with at the end of the performance<br />\nis a number of amazingly complex and<br />\nfascinating patchwork portraits.<br />\nThe Center Stage Theatre is located at<br />\n700 N.

Anyone who attended the<br />\nlast game of the season on Sunday knows what I mean. The<br />\nOrioles lost the deciding game<br />\nof the season to give the divisional pennant to the<br />\nMilwaukee Brewers, but very<br />\nfew of the 51,000 fans left early. When the last out was made<br />\nand the Brewers were<br />\ncelebrating on the mound, the<br />\ncrowd began a standing ovation<br />\nfor the O's which lasted for 20<br />\nminutes.<br />\nFirst, the fans called Earl<br />\nWeaver out of the dugout and<br />\nsaid their final goodbyes to the<br />\nretiring manager with shouts of<br />\n\"Wea-ver.\" Then, with 50,000<br />\nfans shouting,\"We want the<br />\nO's,\" the players came out onto the field and the biggest roar<br />\nof the day went up. It just<br />\nshows that what the Orioles did<br />\nthis year\u2014being in last place in<br />\nMay and coming back to have<br />\nthe second highest winning<br />\npercentage in the majors\u2014can<br />\nbe considered only a victory,<br />\nand the fans knew it.<br />\nOn Sept. 30 the Orioles were<br />\nthree games back with four<br />\ngames left to play with the<br />\nBrewers. Their only chance was<br /><br />\nto sweep the series.<br />\nIn the first game of a<br />\ndoubleheader Friday, the O's,<br />\nled by Rich Dauer who was 3<br />\nfor 4 with 2 RBIs, blasted 15<br />\nhits to score 8 runs off starter<br />\nPete Vuckovitch and three<br />\nrelievers. The Orioles pitchers,<br />\nstarter Dennis Martinez and 7th<br />\ninning reliever Tippy Martinez,<br />\nscattered 12 hits to hold<br />\nMilwaukee to three runs and<br />\nwin the game 8 to 3.<br />\nThe nightcap was an Oriole<br />\nvictory from the first inning on.<br />\nRookie pitcher Storm Davis<br />\nwent the distance holding the<br />\nBrewers to only one run on 6<br />\nhits. The Oriole batters, meanwhile, bombed Milwaukee<br />\nstarter Mike Caldwell, scoring<br />\n7 runs on 13 hits, including<br />\nhomers by Eddie Murray, Lenn<br />\nSakata, Cal Ripken and rookie<br />\nJohn \"T-Bone\" Shelby, his<br />\nfirst as a major leaguer.<br />\nOn Saturday, the O's continued their shelling of the<br />\nBrewers, accumulating 11 runs<br />\non 18 hits off Milwaukeee pitchers Doc Medich, Moose Haas<br />\nand Dave Bernard. Oriole<br />\nstarter Scott McGregor also<br />\nhad tro,uble and left the game<br />\nin the fourth inning after<br />\nMilwaukee had tied the game<br />\n3-3. Reliever Sammy Stewart<br />\ncame on in outstanding relief<br />\nand shut the Brewers down,<br /><br />\nBirds' liackslop<br /><br />\nof the season on Sunday to<br />\ndecide the winner. The Orioles'<br />\nonly chance was to get an<br />\noutstanding pitching performance from Jim Palmer, since<br />\nDon Sutton, Milwaukee's best<br />\npitcher, was not likely to give<br />\nup the number of runs his<br />\npredecessors had. But Palmer<br />\ndid not have the excellent stuff<br />\nthat had made him the O's best<br />\npitcher this season, and Robin<br />\nYount hit a solo homerun in the<br />\nfirst inning and repeated it in<br />\nthe third. Cecil Cooper did the<br /><br />\n.......<br />\nI ase You- Haven't Heard...<br /><br />\nTHE JHU'S RAT IS BACK!!<br />\n11<br />\nMon-Wed<br />\nThurs<br />\nFri<br />\nSat<br /><br />\nhe can play either shortstop or<br />\nthird base, but another good infielder is needed \u2022<br />\nErratic pitching has also been<br />\na problem. Jim Palmer, the ace<br />\nof the staff for so many years,<br />\nwill be 37 next year and may<br />\nnot perform as well as in the<br />\npast. Scott McGregor strained<br />\nhis shoulder and was ineffective<br />\nthe last month of the season,<br />\nbut should be able to<br />\nrehabilitate it over the winter.<br />\nSammy Stewart has often asked to be traded and he may be<br />\ngone by spring in exchange for<br />\nan infielder.<br />\nThe biggest question about<br />\nthe Orioles of 1983 is who will<br />\nthe manager be?

A<br />\ntypical Monday afternoon will<br />\nfind the Hopkins gridders<br />\nworking hard on the field\u2014<br />\nreviewing mistakes and preparing for the upcoming contest.<br />\nBut last Sunday, the films<br />\ndidn't roll. And on the following day, the practice pads remained hung in the team locker<br />\nroom.<br />\nDiscouragement and dejection still hung in the air after<br />\nSaturday's disappointing loss at<br />\nthe hands of the Swarthmore<br />\nQuakers.<br />\nThe Little Quakers came to<br />\nHomewood field boasting the<br />\nbest defense in Division III<br />\nfootball for total yardage and<br />\npoints allowed. Swarthmore<br />\n(3-0) had registered shutouts in<br />\ntheir first two games. Hopkins<br />\nwas looking for their first victory. But as the clock ticked off<br />\nthe final seconds of a 28-10<br />\nscore, Swarthmore had remained unbeaten, and Hopkins was<br />\n'still winless for their 1982<br />\nseason.<br />\nIt was, however, by no<br />\nmeans a pushover for the<br />\nvisiting Quakers. Hopkins<br />\ncame out fired up in the early<br />\ngoing, scoring the first points of<br />\nthe season against the<br />\nSwarthmore defense on their<br />\nopening series of plays. With<br />\nMike Burke platooned to wide<br /><br />\nreceiver, freshman quarterback<br />\nMark Campbell responded to<br />\nopening-game honors with a<br />\n58-yard keeper around the left<br />\nside on the second play of their<br />\ndrive. Four plays later, fellow<br />\nclassmate John O'Melia drilled<br />\na 27-yard field goal to put the<br />\nJays up 3-0. After a Swarthmore<br />\npunt, the Hopkins offense<br />\nmoved again, threatening with<br />\na 61-yard drive to the Quaker<br />\n1 yard line, illustrating a sound<br /><br />\nrecovered the fumble for a<br />\nHopkins touchdown. O'Melia.<br />\nkicked the extra point and the<br />\n10-0.<br />\nled<br />\nJays<br />\nBut it was all Swarthmore<br />\nafter that.<br />\nHalfback Ed Meehan, racing<br />\n132 yards on the day, began to<br />\ntake things into his own hands.<br />\nMeehan set up the first<br />\nSwarthmore score in the first<br />\nhalf with a combination of<br />\npitch-outs and end sweeps. At<br /><br />\nKoscelansky burst up the middle for his second score of the<br />\nday.<br />\nThe Hopkins offense, showing a steady running diet<br />\nthroughout the course of the<br />\ncontest, accumulated 222 yards<br />\non the ground. McLam led the<br />\nway with 80 yards. But the<br />\nJays, harrassed with inconsistency, couldn't seem to come<br />\nup with the big plays. Poor<br />\nfield position and four costly<br /><br />\nQB Mark Campbell unloads pass.<br /><br />\nrunning attack of Bob Sternfeld<br />\nand freshman Brad McLam.<br />\nBut on a 4th and 1 at the goal<br />\nline, Sternfeld couldn't break<br />\ninto the end zone, and Swarthmore took possession of the<br />\nball. On the ensuing play, the<br />\nBlue Jay defense stacked<br />\nSwarthmore's halfback Ed<br />\nMeehan in their own end zone,<br />\njarring the ball loose. Jay Smith<br /><br />\nthe 7:34 mark in the third turnovers plagued the Jays atquarter, Meehan ran for a 25- tack in the second halt'.

He is the<br />\nleading running back with a 4.3<br />\nyards per carry record. fony<br />\nNutter, a 5'9\", 150 pound<br />\nspeedster is also certain to play<br />\nmore than he has up to now.<br />\nOther freshman likely to see<br />\nmore action as linebackers this<br />\nweek are Dan Pallace, and<br />\nJohn Byrd. Sophomores Vince<br />\nBattaglia and Mike Dickson<br />\nwill see action in the defensive<br />\nsecondary;<br />\nCoach Pfeifer will need to do<br />\nwithout the services of two key<br />\nplayers.
