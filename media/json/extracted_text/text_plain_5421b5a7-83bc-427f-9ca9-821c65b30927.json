No real<br />\nreevaluation is necessary.\"<br />\nOver 50 per cent of all<br />\nstudents cheat at one time<br />\nor another in college, a recent<br />\nsurvey on cheating by Columbia University's Bureau of<br />\nApplied Social Research has<br />\nrevealed.<br />\nCheating Low Here<br />\nHenderson noted that this<br />\n<br />\nVOL. LXIX, NO. 15<br />\n<br />\nwas \"definitely not\" the case<br />\nat Hopkins. It is hard to say<br />\nstatistically how many do<br />\ncheat, but it is his belief that<br />\nthe amount of cheating is<br />\nlow here.<br />\nFirst of all, the number<br />\nof Honor Commission trials<br />\nis only twelve to twenty per<br />\nyear. Furthermore, Henderson noted that there are indications that people turn in<br />\nviolators. And he added,<br />\n\"Very few of my friends have<br />\nseen violations.\"<br />\nNo Upward Trend<br />\nFluctuation in the number<br />\nof honor convictions from<br />\nyear to year is common only<br />\nbecause the absolute number<br />\nis always so small. There has<br />\nbeen no continuing increase<br />\nor decrease of violations.<br />\nAnother aspect of college<br />\n<br />\ncheating noted by the Columbia Survey is that cheating is<br />\ncorrelated with a student's<br />\nmajor. Two-thirds of business and commerce majors<br />\ncheat at one time or another.<br />\nEngineers and education, social science and fine arts<br />\nmajors are also above the 50<br />\nper cent level.<br />\nChem. Bad<br />\nBut at Hopkins cheating by<br />\nmajor is not apparent. \"It<br />\ndoesn't impress anyone that<br />\nway,\" according to Henderson, but some courses like<br />\nintro. chem. seem to produce<br />\nslightly more violations.<br />\nViolations are not particularly predominant in any<br />\nclass (freshman, sophomore,<br />\netc.).<br />\nIdeal Necessary<br />\nWhat Henderson considers<br />\n<br />\n\"t Nrttin<br />\n<br />\nmost important for the success of an honor system is<br />\nthe presence of some sort of<br />\nideal unifying the student<br />\nbody. He cited Notre Dame,<br />\nwhich has called on Christian<br />\nideals in starting its honor<br />\nsystem, as an example.<br />\nAt<br />\nHopkins,<br />\nFreshman<br />\norientation with the Honor<br />\nSystem as well as faculty cooperation is important in perpetuating the effectiveness of<br />\nthe system. It is important<br />\nthat the latter spell out<br />\ncourse<br />\nrequirements<br />\nand<br />\nmake it clear what they expect from the student.<br />\nFew Second Offenses<br />\nHenderson feels that the<br />\ncurrent penalty system is<br />\nquite adequate. Second viola-<br />\n<br />\ntions (requiring the student's<br />\nexpulsion) are rare. There<br />\nhas only been one in the past<br />\nsix or seven years to his<br />\nknowledge.<br />\nPerhaps the most objectionable part of the honor<br />\nsystem to many perons is<br />\nthe requirement that students<br />\nmust report violations by fellow students. Henderson admitted that a lot of students<br />\nobject to this. They have the<br />\nattitude, \"What other people<br />\ndo is their own business.\"<br />\nBut \"there are advantages to<br />\nthe system of informing since<br />\nwithout it we wouldn't have<br />\naccusations other than from<br />\nfaculty.\" Both faculty and<br />\nstudent reports are regular<br />\noccurrerioes<br />\n<br />\niCettr<br />\n<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5. 1965<br />\n<br />\n..\u20ac11\u20221=1<br />\n<br />\n69TH YEAR<br />\n<br />\nBologna Center Boss Wants Frat Parties Prof. Hoelscher To Leave,<br />\nNew Living Center To Aid Have Only Beer Will Head Eng.

Almost every epoch<br />\nrequires a new start.\" In their respective epochs, Presidents Remsen, Goodnow, Ames, Bowman, and Bronk,<br />\nall spoke of change as a required element in the functions of a University. And in our own epoch, Dr.<br />\nEisenhower has given evidence that he will join the<br />\nranks of these illustrious gentlemen.<br />\nThe Long Range Planning Committee, recently<br />\nInitiated by Dr. Eisenhower, has taken in charge the<br />\nchallenging of some seriously ingrained habits of the<br />\nUniversity; for example, the habit of academically separating the sciences and liberal arts; the custom of<br />\nundergraduate-graduate academic coexistence; and even<br />\nthe University's propensity to accept only male undergraduates.<br />\nThis measured evaluation of the University deierves comment in two contexts. Firstly, in that it is<br />\nlaudable; it exemplifies an administration unencumbered by the seditious static and traditional webs of<br />\nmany educational institutions whose major purpose is<br />\nto shelter its cherubs from the harshness of a changing<br />\nworld: an administration capable of lofty considerations.<br />\nSecondly, in that it is not unique: this mandate<br />\nfor change is one of a long string of plans which have<br />\nattempted to fit the university style to the new modes<br />\nof a changing student. It is a mandate conceived in<br />\nperspective to incorporate rather than shy away from<br />\nthe environment. It is not a reversal of principle (which<br />\nmight very well be alarming), but an alteration in its<br />\napplication.<br />\nDr. Eisenhower's Planning Committee has a third<br />\ncharacteristic. It may encourage, by example, the undergraduates to bend their thoughts to the more fundamental rather than the picayune. It may inhibit the<br />\nbickering over an inconvenient course schedule, the<br />\nbickering over the punishment to be metered out to<br />\ntwo anonymous animal manglers, or the Student Council squabbling over the installation of a snack bar in<br />\nthe New Library. It may invite more substantial suggestions from the students in lieu of the normal<br />\npettiness.<br />\nDr. Eisenhower, in his long range designs, has<br />\nchosen to speak of many things; and we should he<br />\npleased that the administration has chosen to speak<br />\nespecially of lofty things: the outcome of the University<br />\nin accordance with the inevitability of change.<br />\nJean-Paul Sartre, as the subject of his latest book,<br />\nalmost lamentably justifies his outcome in terms of his<br />\nenvironment; the University's goal, in its latest move,<br />\nappears to be to determine its environment in terms of<br />\nIts outcome.<br />\n<br />\nRoyal Gambit Applauded<br />\nAs coded Hop gentlemen girded their collective<br />\nloins in preparation for final exams, their Goucher<br />\nsisters also labored. From the cool, purple broadcloth of lower Kraushaar was conceived a production worthy of praise and a copious note or two.<br />\nThe January 22-23 production of Hermann Gressieker's Royal Gambit renders manifold reasons<br />\nfor exhaustive applause, yet most impressive was<br />\nits intuitive, dramatic-honesty. It is a quality seldom seen in these environs.<br />\nGressieker had presented his six college daughters with an intriguing, workable script. George<br />\nDowell, Gambit's director must be credited with<br />\nskillfully handling the difficult feat of telescoping<br />\nwhat was originally a five act script into a more<br />\nTowson-compatible three acts. It was clear that<br />\nMr. Dowell retained a thoughtful understanding<br />\nof the play; it moved, as his feminine players,<br />\nwith continuity, dignity, delight and grace.<br />\nThe first two acts of Royal Gambit concern<br />\nthemselves with the moral machinations of Henry<br />\nVII and the wifely repercussions incurred. The<br />\nthird and final act brings the author's message<br />\nto the front in the induction of Project Apollo<br />\nand the Korean War. Yet rather than degenerating into an Orson Wells Julius Ceasar in modern<br />\ndress, Gambit, through the full implementation<br />\nof the author's considerable talent, retains its<br />\ncharacter. The quality of the play is implicit in<br />\nthe manner in which Gressieker justifies the<br />\ndisturbing transition. The audience is never permitted to lose the abiding link it has built with<br />\n<br />\nHenry throughout the play. Though in the complexity of statecraft General McArthur is substituted for Pope Clement moral rationalization<br />\nremains the issue, it still belongs to Henry, and<br />\nthrough Henry, to us.<br />\nRussell Gold, who starred in the New York production of Royal Gambit played Henry VIII. He<br />\nseemed to communicate his enjoyment of the play<br />\nto both the audience and the cast. It is to God's<br />\nprofessional credit that he never dominated the<br />\nplay as he cavorted and hobbled through the<br />\nbumblingly-eloquent life of Henry Tudor. The<br />\nremainder of the cast recruited from the ranks of<br />\nFroehlicher and Stimson et al. included Joan<br />\nWillner, who as Katherine of Aragon, with rich<br />\nfull voice, personified regal and womanly strength<br />\nand Susan Rodgers as Anne Boleyn. Miss Rodgers<br />\ncarried herself with a self-dignity so often neglected in an amateur actors frantic effort to \"get<br />\ninto\" a part. Doris Messec as Anne of Cleves<br />\nhandled a difficult part with success, as did Janice<br />\nKramer playing Jane Seymour, Elizabeth Spear<br />\nand Judith Lowry rounded out the remainder of<br />\nthe royal peerage; both were regal and dramatic<br />\nin all the right places<br />\nSuccess of Royal Gambit has given impetus<br />\nto speculation that the production might transcend<br />\nthe traditional collegiate two night stand to appear on local television.

No real<br />\nreevaluation is necessary.\"<br />\nOver 50 per cent of all<br />\nstudents cheat at one time<br />\nor another in college, a recent<br />\nsurvey on cheating by Columbia University's Bureau of<br />\nApplied Social Research has<br />\nrevealed.<br />\nCheating Low Here<br />\nHenderson noted that this<br /><br />\nVOL. LXIX, NO. 15<br /><br />\nwas \"definitely not\" the case<br />\nat Hopkins. It is hard to say<br />\nstatistically how many do<br />\ncheat, but it is his belief that<br />\nthe amount of cheating is<br />\nlow here.<br />\nFirst of all, the number<br />\nof Honor Commission trials<br />\nis only twelve to twenty per<br />\nyear. Furthermore, Henderson noted that there are indications that people turn in<br />\nviolators. And he added,<br />\n\"Very few of my friends have<br />\nseen violations.\"<br />\nNo Upward Trend<br />\nFluctuation in the number<br />\nof honor convictions from<br />\nyear to year is common only<br />\nbecause the absolute number<br />\nis always so small. There has<br />\nbeen no continuing increase<br />\nor decrease of violations.<br />\nAnother aspect of college<br /><br />\ncheating noted by the Columbia Survey is that cheating is<br />\ncorrelated with a student's<br />\nmajor. Two-thirds of business and commerce majors<br />\ncheat at one time or another.<br />\nEngineers and education, social science and fine arts<br />\nmajors are also above the 50<br />\nper cent level.<br />\nChem. Bad<br />\nBut at Hopkins cheating by<br />\nmajor is not apparent. \"It<br />\ndoesn't impress anyone that<br />\nway,\" according to Henderson, but some courses like<br />\nintro. chem. seem to produce<br />\nslightly more violations.<br />\nViolations are not particularly predominant in any<br />\nclass (freshman, sophomore,<br />\netc.).<br />\nIdeal Necessary<br />\nWhat Henderson considers<br /><br />\n\"t Nrttin<br /><br />\nmost important for the success of an honor system is<br />\nthe presence of some sort of<br />\nideal unifying the student<br />\nbody. He cited Notre Dame,<br />\nwhich has called on Christian<br />\nideals in starting its honor<br />\nsystem, as an example.<br />\nAt<br />\nHopkins,<br />\nFreshman<br />\norientation with the Honor<br />\nSystem as well as faculty cooperation is important in perpetuating the effectiveness of<br />\nthe system. It is important<br />\nthat the latter spell out<br />\ncourse<br />\nrequirements<br />\nand<br />\nmake it clear what they expect from the student.<br />\nFew Second Offenses<br />\nHenderson feels that the<br />\ncurrent penalty system is<br />\nquite adequate. Second viola-<br /><br />\ntions (requiring the student's<br />\nexpulsion) are rare. There<br />\nhas only been one in the past<br />\nsix or seven years to his<br />\nknowledge.<br />\nPerhaps the most objectionable part of the honor<br />\nsystem to many perons is<br />\nthe requirement that students<br />\nmust report violations by fellow students. Henderson admitted that a lot of students<br />\nobject to this. They have the<br />\nattitude, \"What other people<br />\ndo is their own business.\"<br />\nBut \"there are advantages to<br />\nthe system of informing since<br />\nwithout it we wouldn't have<br />\naccusations other than from<br />\nfaculty.\" Both faculty and<br />\nstudent reports are regular<br />\noccurrerioes<br /><br />\niCettr<br /><br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 5. 1965<br /><br />\n..\u20ac11\u20221=1<br /><br />\n69TH YEAR<br /><br />\nBologna Center Boss Wants Frat Parties Prof. Hoelscher To Leave,<br />\nNew Living Center To Aid Have Only Beer Will Head Eng.

Almost every epoch<br />\nrequires a new start.\" In their respective epochs, Presidents Remsen, Goodnow, Ames, Bowman, and Bronk,<br />\nall spoke of change as a required element in the functions of a University. And in our own epoch, Dr.<br />\nEisenhower has given evidence that he will join the<br />\nranks of these illustrious gentlemen.<br />\nThe Long Range Planning Committee, recently<br />\nInitiated by Dr. Eisenhower, has taken in charge the<br />\nchallenging of some seriously ingrained habits of the<br />\nUniversity; for example, the habit of academically separating the sciences and liberal arts; the custom of<br />\nundergraduate-graduate academic coexistence; and even<br />\nthe University's propensity to accept only male undergraduates.<br />\nThis measured evaluation of the University deierves comment in two contexts. Firstly, in that it is<br />\nlaudable; it exemplifies an administration unencumbered by the seditious static and traditional webs of<br />\nmany educational institutions whose major purpose is<br />\nto shelter its cherubs from the harshness of a changing<br />\nworld: an administration capable of lofty considerations.<br />\nSecondly, in that it is not unique: this mandate<br />\nfor change is one of a long string of plans which have<br />\nattempted to fit the university style to the new modes<br />\nof a changing student. It is a mandate conceived in<br />\nperspective to incorporate rather than shy away from<br />\nthe environment. It is not a reversal of principle (which<br />\nmight very well be alarming), but an alteration in its<br />\napplication.<br />\nDr. Eisenhower's Planning Committee has a third<br />\ncharacteristic. It may encourage, by example, the undergraduates to bend their thoughts to the more fundamental rather than the picayune. It may inhibit the<br />\nbickering over an inconvenient course schedule, the<br />\nbickering over the punishment to be metered out to<br />\ntwo anonymous animal manglers, or the Student Council squabbling over the installation of a snack bar in<br />\nthe New Library. It may invite more substantial suggestions from the students in lieu of the normal<br />\npettiness.<br />\nDr. Eisenhower, in his long range designs, has<br />\nchosen to speak of many things; and we should he<br />\npleased that the administration has chosen to speak<br />\nespecially of lofty things: the outcome of the University<br />\nin accordance with the inevitability of change.<br />\nJean-Paul Sartre, as the subject of his latest book,<br />\nalmost lamentably justifies his outcome in terms of his<br />\nenvironment; the University's goal, in its latest move,<br />\nappears to be to determine its environment in terms of<br />\nIts outcome.<br /><br />\nRoyal Gambit Applauded<br />\nAs coded Hop gentlemen girded their collective<br />\nloins in preparation for final exams, their Goucher<br />\nsisters also labored. From the cool, purple broadcloth of lower Kraushaar was conceived a production worthy of praise and a copious note or two.<br />\nThe January 22-23 production of Hermann Gressieker's Royal Gambit renders manifold reasons<br />\nfor exhaustive applause, yet most impressive was<br />\nits intuitive, dramatic-honesty. It is a quality seldom seen in these environs.<br />\nGressieker had presented his six college daughters with an intriguing, workable script. George<br />\nDowell, Gambit's director must be credited with<br />\nskillfully handling the difficult feat of telescoping<br />\nwhat was originally a five act script into a more<br />\nTowson-compatible three acts. It was clear that<br />\nMr. Dowell retained a thoughtful understanding<br />\nof the play; it moved, as his feminine players,<br />\nwith continuity, dignity, delight and grace.<br />\nThe first two acts of Royal Gambit concern<br />\nthemselves with the moral machinations of Henry<br />\nVII and the wifely repercussions incurred. The<br />\nthird and final act brings the author's message<br />\nto the front in the induction of Project Apollo<br />\nand the Korean War. Yet rather than degenerating into an Orson Wells Julius Ceasar in modern<br />\ndress, Gambit, through the full implementation<br />\nof the author's considerable talent, retains its<br />\ncharacter. The quality of the play is implicit in<br />\nthe manner in which Gressieker justifies the<br />\ndisturbing transition. The audience is never permitted to lose the abiding link it has built with<br /><br />\nHenry throughout the play. Though in the complexity of statecraft General McArthur is substituted for Pope Clement moral rationalization<br />\nremains the issue, it still belongs to Henry, and<br />\nthrough Henry, to us.<br />\nRussell Gold, who starred in the New York production of Royal Gambit played Henry VIII. He<br />\nseemed to communicate his enjoyment of the play<br />\nto both the audience and the cast. It is to God's<br />\nprofessional credit that he never dominated the<br />\nplay as he cavorted and hobbled through the<br />\nbumblingly-eloquent life of Henry Tudor. The<br />\nremainder of the cast recruited from the ranks of<br />\nFroehlicher and Stimson et al. included Joan<br />\nWillner, who as Katherine of Aragon, with rich<br />\nfull voice, personified regal and womanly strength<br />\nand Susan Rodgers as Anne Boleyn. Miss Rodgers<br />\ncarried herself with a self-dignity so often neglected in an amateur actors frantic effort to \"get<br />\ninto\" a part. Doris Messec as Anne of Cleves<br />\nhandled a difficult part with success, as did Janice<br />\nKramer playing Jane Seymour, Elizabeth Spear<br />\nand Judith Lowry rounded out the remainder of<br />\nthe royal peerage; both were regal and dramatic<br />\nin all the right places<br />\nSuccess of Royal Gambit has given impetus<br />\nto speculation that the production might transcend<br />\nthe traditional collegiate two night stand to appear on local television. If this be so\u201e then Hopkins<br />\nloin girders may be granted a second opportunity<br />\nto view a highly articulate performance of an ex\u2014H.K.<br />\ncellent play.<br /><br />\nLibrary Hosts Noon-Time Concerts<br />\nProgram for the noon-time concerts<br />\nat the Garrett room in the Library.<br /><br />\nTuesday: The Royal music of Europe:<br /><br />\nThursday:<br /><br />\nMozart: Quartet in B flat, K.V. 468, Richard Strauss songs:<br />\n\"The Hunt\" by the Clairemont String by Lisa de la Casa<br />\nMonday: Jazz concert:<br />\nQuartet<br />\nIch wollt em n Strausslein; Standchen.<br />\nBenny Goodman in Moscow (original<br />\nrecording)<br />\nop. 17; Allerseelen; Fur funNehn<br />\nKeyboard Music of the French court<br />\n(Let's dance, Mission to Moscow,<br />\npfennige; Ich trage meine mimic;<br />\nby Paul Maynard, organ and harpsiMeet the band, I got it bad and that<br />\nchord<br />\nNiehts, op. 10: Die Nacht, op. 10,<br />\nain't good, Why you?
