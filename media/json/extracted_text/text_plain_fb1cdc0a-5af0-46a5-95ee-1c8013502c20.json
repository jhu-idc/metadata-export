This would create<br />\na better liaison between students<br />\nand representatives, leading to<br />\nreturn of trust in and respect<br />\nfor the council as a truly representative body, a body mediating<br />\nbetween students and administration, taking no side if possible, and taking the students'<br />\nside when necessary.

Here's what has happened:<br />\nThree V-8 Falcon Sprints were entered In the<br />\nMonte Carlo Rallye. This is not a race. It is a trial<br />\nof a car's total capabilities. We did it (nervously) for<br />\nthe experience and with practically no sense of expectation, because we had not entered an event like this<br />\nbefore. One Sprint ended the experiment in a snowbank. But the others finished 1-2 in their class with<br />\nsuch authority that they moved the good, grey London Times to say:\"The Falcons are part of a power<br />\nand performance plan that will shake up motoring in<br />\nevery country in the world.\" That was Number One.<br />\nNumber Two was a double win in the Pure Oil<br />\nPerformance Trials. Fords captured Class 1 and Class<br />\n2 (for high performance and large V-8's). Both of<br />\nthese trials were for over-all points rolled up in<br />\neconomy, acceleration and braking tests.<br />\nThen, at Riverside in California, in America's only<br />\nlong-distance stock car event that is run on a road<br />\ncourse (as opposed to closed circuit, banked tracks<br />\nsuch as the track at Daytona), Dan Gurney pushed<br />\na Ford to first place.<br />\nThe latest news comes north from Daytona. There<br />\nIn the open test that tears cars apart\u2014the Daytona<br />\n500\u2014Ford durability conquered the field. Fords<br />\nswept the first 5 places...something no one else had<br />\nequaled in the history of the event. In a competition<br />\n\u2014which anyone can enter\u2014designed to prove how<br />\n<br />\nwell a car hangs together, 9 Fords finished out of 12<br />\n<br />\nentered. .. a truly remarkable record considering<br />\nthat over 50% of all cars entered failed to finish.<br />\nWhy do we keep such an interested eye on competitions such as these? Is speed important to us?<br />\nFrankly, no. The speed capabilities of the leading<br />\nAmerican cars are now grouped so closely together<br />\nthat the differences have no real meaning.To us, who<br />\nare building cars, success in this kind of competition<br />\nmeans just one thing: the car is strong.

Not that<br />\nwe<br />\nare against kidnapping, per se, as a function of fraternity<br />\npledging (a functioning which will always remain somewhat of an enigma); but it should be confined<br />\nto its<br />\nproper sphere.<br />\nDuring the past few years, fraternity kidnapping<br />\nhas been rather quiescent due to the WC regula<br />\ntions<br />\nprohibiting it on the campus itself. These regula<br />\ntions<br />\nwere promulgated because the kidnapping<br />\nspread<br />\nfrom within the ranks of the fraternity organi<br />\nzations to<br />\nthe non-Greek subsystem of the undergradu<br />\nate body.<br />\nBasically, the ruling was a civil rights measu<br />\nre on the<br />\ncampus body protecting the individual from<br />\nthe overbearing inconsitleracy of the groups of<br />\nkidnappers.<br />\nThe goings-on during the past few weeks<br />\nregarding<br />\nkidnapping has apparently remained in<br />\nthe ranks of the<br />\nfraternity groups.

As everyone<br />\nknows, this year's council has so<br />\nmany committees that it has to<br />\nhave a committee to keep track<br />\nof committees. This I will<br />\nchange. The best way for the<br />\ncouncil to accomplish anything<br />\nis to devote its full strength toward one problem at a time.<br />\nThe main problem which the<br />\ncouncil has always been faced<br />\nwith is the lack of good ideas. To<br />\nremedy this I propose brainstorming sessions to develop<br />\nplans of attack to better serve<br />\nthe student body. The students<br />\nshould be more aware of what is<br />\ngoing on in the council so there<br />\nwill be a stepped up publicity<br />\ncampaign and a periodic newsletter sent out.<br />\nIf I am elected I shall make<br />\npersonal reports to the student<br />\nbody regularly. To augment a<br />\ntwo-way flow of information, the<br />\ncouncil will use suggestion boxes<br />\ne,nd the bureau of campus opinion. In this way I feel some excitement can be created, some<br />\nInterest can be generated and<br />\n<br />\nmaybe even something accomplished.<br />\nThe next question is obviously<br />\nwhat should be accomplished.<br />\nFirst and foremost there is the<br />\nnormal business of the council:<br />\nhelping the students achieve<br />\nacademic, social, and cultural<br />\nimprovements as I outlined in<br />\nthe first question.<br />\nThen, I have some pet projects. I would like to see courses<br />\nto aid us in fields other than<br />\nour future careers, such as musicology and fine arts. We need<br />\na better advising system. We<br />\nshould bring more important big<br />\nname speakers to speak at our<br />\nassemblies. Perhaps the heads of<br />\ndepartments could be convinced<br />\nto teach more undergraduate<br />\ncourses.<br />\nIn the social area the council<br />\ncould sponsor B.Y.O. parties<br />\n<br />\nSaturday nights on weekends<br />\nwith no scheduled activities<br />\nwhere there would be a band, set<br />\nups, and perhaps student entertainment. I would establish a<br />\nHopkins humor magazine to provide a creative outlet for some<br />\nof our funny students. And I<br />\nwould like to see more money for<br />\nstudent activities.<br />\nOf course I can't promise to<br />\naccomplish all of this but I can<br />\npromise to work towards these<br />\ngoals with all my energies. I<br />\nthink that once again it will be<br />\npossible to have a potent Student Council, but it will require<br />\neffort on the part of the new<br />\ncouncil president, the entire<br />\ncouncil's support, and the interested participation and active<br />\nsupport of the student body.<br />\n<br />\nPAGE FIVE<br />\n<br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\nDaily 8 A.M. to 6 P.M.<br />\nMon., Thurs., Fri.

So<br />\ncatch yourself a passing zephyr<br />\nand waft on down to your<br />\nChevrolet showroom.<br />\n<br />\nMy favorite cousin, Mandolin Glebe,a sweet, unspoiled country<br />\nboy, has just started college. Today I got a letter from him<br />\nwhich I will reprint here because I know Mandolin's problems<br />\nare so much like your own. Mandolin writes:<br />\nDear Mandolin (he thinks my name is Mandolin too),<br />\nI see by the college paper that you are writing a column for<br />\nMarlboro Cigarettes. I think Marlboros are jim-dandy cigarettes with real nice tobacco and a ginger-peachy filter, and<br />\nI want to tell you why I don't smoke them.<br />\nIt all started the very first day I arrived at college. I was<br />\nwalking across the campus, swinging my paper valise and singing traditional airs like Blue Tail Fly and Death and Transfiguration, when all of a sudden I ran into this here collegiatelooking fellow with a monogram on his breast pocket. He asked<br />\nme was I a freshman. I said yes. He asked me did I want to<br />\nbe a BMOC and the envy of all the in crowd. I said yes. He<br />\nsaid the only way to make these keen things happen was to join<br />\na fraternity. Fortunately he happened to have a pledge card<br />\nwith him, so he pricked my thumb and I signed. He didn't tell<br />\nme the name of the fraternity or where it is located, but I suppose I'll find out when I go active.<br />\n<br />\n*Optional at extra cost.<br />\n<br />\nawearge too-eici(rz:516iiltaitz24<br />\nMeanwhile this fellow comes around every week to collect<br />\nthe dues, which are $100, plus a $10 fine for missing the weekly<br />\nmeeting, plus a $5 a.ssessment to buy a headstone for Spot, the<br />\nlate, beloved beagle who was the fraternity mascot.<br />\nI have never regretted joining the fraternity, because it is<br />\nmy dearest wish to be a BMOC and the envy of all the in<br />\ncrowd, but you can see that it is not cheap. It wouldn't be so<br />\nbad if I slept at the frat house, but you must agree that I can't<br />\nsleep at the house if I don't know where the house is.<br />\nI have rented a room which is not only grotesquely expensive, but it is not at all the kind of room I was looking for. I<br />\nwanted someplace reasonably priced, clean, comfortable, and<br />\nwithin easy walking distance of classes, the shopping district,<br />\nand San Francisco and New York. What I found was a bedroom<br />\nin the home of a local costermonger which is dingy, expensive,<br />\nand uncomfortable\u2014and I don't even get to use the bed till<br />\n7 a.m. when my landlord goes out to mong his costers.<br />\nWell anyhow, I got settled and the next thing.I did, naturally,<br />\nwas to look for a girl. And I found her. Harriet, her name is,<br />\nbeautiful creature standing just under seven feet high and weighing 385 pounds. I first spied her leaning against the statue of<br />\nthe Founder, dozing lightly. I talked to her for several hours<br />\nwithout effect. Only when I mentioned dinner did she stir. Her<br />\nmilky little eyes opened, she raised a brawny arm, seized my<br />\nnape, and carried me to a chic French restaurant called Le<br />\nClipjoint where she consumed, according to my calculations,<br />\nher own weight in chateaubriand.<br />\nAfter dinner she lapsed into a torpor from which I could not<br />\nrouse her, no matter how I tried. I banged my glass with a<br />\nfork, I pinched her great pendulous jowls, I rubbed the legs of<br />\nmy corduroy pants together. But nothing worked, and finally<br />\nI slang her over my shoulder and carried her to the girls dorm,<br />\nslipping several discs in the process.<br />\nFortunately, medical care for students is provided free at the<br />\ncollege infirmary. All I had to pay for were a few extras, like<br />\nX-rays, anaesthesia, forceps, hemostats, scalpels, catgut, linen,<br />\ntowels, amortization, and nurses. They would not, however,<br />\nlet me keep the nurses.<br />\nSo, dear cousin, it is lack of funds, not lack of enthusiasm,<br />\nthat is keeping me from Marlboro Cigarettes\u2014dear, good<br />\nMarlboros with their fine blend of choice tobaccos and their<br />\npure white Selectrate filter and their soft pack and their flip<br />\ntop box.<br />\nWell, I must close now.

Here's what has happened:<br />\nThree V-8 Falcon Sprints were entered In the<br />\nMonte Carlo Rallye. This is not a race. It is a trial<br />\nof a car's total capabilities. We did it (nervously) for<br />\nthe experience and with practically no sense of expectation, because we had not entered an event like this<br />\nbefore. One Sprint ended the experiment in a snowbank. But the others finished 1-2 in their class with<br />\nsuch authority that they moved the good, grey London Times to say:\"The Falcons are part of a power<br />\nand performance plan that will shake up motoring in<br />\nevery country in the world.\" That was Number One.<br />\nNumber Two was a double win in the Pure Oil<br />\nPerformance Trials. Fords captured Class 1 and Class<br />\n2 (for high performance and large V-8's). Both of<br />\nthese trials were for over-all points rolled up in<br />\neconomy, acceleration and braking tests.<br />\nThen, at Riverside in California, in America's only<br />\nlong-distance stock car event that is run on a road<br />\ncourse (as opposed to closed circuit, banked tracks<br />\nsuch as the track at Daytona), Dan Gurney pushed<br />\na Ford to first place.<br />\nThe latest news comes north from Daytona. There<br />\nIn the open test that tears cars apart\u2014the Daytona<br />\n500\u2014Ford durability conquered the field. Fords<br />\nswept the first 5 places...something no one else had<br />\nequaled in the history of the event. In a competition<br />\n\u2014which anyone can enter\u2014designed to prove how<br /><br />\nwell a car hangs together, 9 Fords finished out of 12<br /><br />\nentered. .. a truly remarkable record considering<br />\nthat over 50% of all cars entered failed to finish.<br />\nWhy do we keep such an interested eye on competitions such as these? Is speed important to us?<br />\nFrankly, no. The speed capabilities of the leading<br />\nAmerican cars are now grouped so closely together<br />\nthat the differences have no real meaning.To us, who<br />\nare building cars, success in this kind of competition<br />\nmeans just one thing: the car is strong. This kind of<br />\nperformance capability means that the car is so well<br />\nbuilt that it can stand up to normal driving\u2014the<br />\nkind of day-in, day-out demands you put your own<br />\ncar through\u2014for thousands of miles longer than less<br />\ncapable cars.<br />\nIn tests like the Daytona 500 and Riverside, we<br />\nfind out in an afternoon what might take us 100,000<br />\ntest-track miles to discover. We learn how to build<br />\nsuperior strength into suspension systems, steering<br />\nsystems, drive train, body, tires. Anyone can build<br />\na fast car. What we're interested in is the concept of<br />\n\"total\" performance.<br />\nWe believe in this kind of total performance<br />\nbecause the search for performance made the automobile the wonderfully efficient and pleasurable instrument it is today\u2014and will make it better tomorrow.<br />\nAmerica's nveRest,most care free carol<br /><br />\nFORD<br />\nFALCON \u2022FAIRLANE \u2022 FORD \u2022THUNDERBIRD<br /><br />\nFOR 60 YEARS THE SYMBOL 0<br />\nDEPENDABLE PRODUCTS<br />\n1--)t<br />\no4CMOTOR COMPANY<br /><br />\nPAGE FOUR<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\n011r 3Thlins<br /><br />\nnvkins News-triter<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MARCH 22,<br />\n1963<br /><br />\nPlay Review<br /><br />\nEditors-in-Chief<br />\nKen<br /><br />\nNobel<br />\nBusiness Managers<br /><br />\nTom Smith<br /><br />\nEd Morse<br />\nJack Clock<br /><br />\nBOARD OF CONTROL<br />\nContributing Editor<br />\nDan Rosen felt, Ken Lasson<br />\nNews Editor<br />\nGary Moore<br /><br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nAssociate Editors<br />\nIry Nathan<br />\nAlan Smokier, Matt Crenson<br />\nComposition Editor<br />\nSports Editor<br />\nDave Caldon<br />\nHardy Levavy<br /><br />\nCoordinating Editor<br />\nMark Roter<br /><br />\nFeatures Editor<br />\nTony Cook<br />\nPhotopgraphy Editor<br />\nAl Cohen<br />\nStudent Activities Editor<br />\nRon Specitor<br /><br />\nCopy Editor<br />\nJerry Verlin<br />\nArts Editor<br />\nBob Landau<br /><br />\nAssociate Staff<br /><br />\nAss't.

These regula<br />\ntions<br />\nwere promulgated because the kidnapping<br />\nspread<br />\nfrom within the ranks of the fraternity organi<br />\nzations to<br />\nthe non-Greek subsystem of the undergradu<br />\nate body.<br />\nBasically, the ruling was a civil rights measu<br />\nre on the<br />\ncampus body protecting the individual from<br />\nthe overbearing inconsitleracy of the groups of<br />\nkidnappers.<br />\nThe goings-on during the past few weeks<br />\nregarding<br />\nkidnapping has apparently remained in<br />\nthe ranks of the<br />\nfraternity groups. Hopefully, kidnapping<br />\nwill remain<br />\nconfined to the realm where it is acceptable,<br />\nif not desirable, and thus make enforcement of<br />\nanti-kidnapping<br />\nlegislation unnecessary.<br /><br />\nj<br /><br />\nPHONE MU. 5-7773<br /><br />\nNOW PLAYING<br />\nThe World's Most Highly Praised<br />\nFilm!<br />\n\u2022\"MAGNIFICENT!\" The New Yorker<br />\n\u2022\"VIVID, BEAUTIFUL!\" \u2014Tome Mag.<br /><br />\n1310[41EAC<br />\nsiA\"'\"ROBERT RYAN \u2022 PETER USTINOV<br /><br />\nTERENCE STAMP<br /><br />\nAcademy Aworc Nominee<br /><br />\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR<br /><br />\nILTizbrircrimirw<br />\n5010 PARK HEIGHTS AVENUE<br /><br />\nPHONE LI. 2-2049<br /><br />\nNOMINATED FOR ACADEMY AWARD!<br /><br />\nBEST ACTRESS<br />\nKATHARINE HEPBURN<br />\nRALPH RICHARDSON<br />\nJASON ROBARDS, JR.<br />\nDEAN STOCKWELL<br />\nEugene O'Neill's<br />\nAPRIL 3rd<br /><br />\nMaryland Premiere<br />\nEngagement<br />\nTo Follow \"BILLY BUDD\"<br /><br />\nAll FOUR STARS<br />\nreceived<br /><br />\n)13A FtLES<br /><br />\n1711 N.

As everyone<br />\nknows, this year's council has so<br />\nmany committees that it has to<br />\nhave a committee to keep track<br />\nof committees. This I will<br />\nchange. The best way for the<br />\ncouncil to accomplish anything<br />\nis to devote its full strength toward one problem at a time.<br />\nThe main problem which the<br />\ncouncil has always been faced<br />\nwith is the lack of good ideas. To<br />\nremedy this I propose brainstorming sessions to develop<br />\nplans of attack to better serve<br />\nthe student body. The students<br />\nshould be more aware of what is<br />\ngoing on in the council so there<br />\nwill be a stepped up publicity<br />\ncampaign and a periodic newsletter sent out.<br />\nIf I am elected I shall make<br />\npersonal reports to the student<br />\nbody regularly. To augment a<br />\ntwo-way flow of information, the<br />\ncouncil will use suggestion boxes<br />\ne,nd the bureau of campus opinion. In this way I feel some excitement can be created, some<br />\nInterest can be generated and<br /><br />\nmaybe even something accomplished.<br />\nThe next question is obviously<br />\nwhat should be accomplished.<br />\nFirst and foremost there is the<br />\nnormal business of the council:<br />\nhelping the students achieve<br />\nacademic, social, and cultural<br />\nimprovements as I outlined in<br />\nthe first question.<br />\nThen, I have some pet projects. I would like to see courses<br />\nto aid us in fields other than<br />\nour future careers, such as musicology and fine arts. We need<br />\na better advising system. We<br />\nshould bring more important big<br />\nname speakers to speak at our<br />\nassemblies. Perhaps the heads of<br />\ndepartments could be convinced<br />\nto teach more undergraduate<br />\ncourses.<br />\nIn the social area the council<br />\ncould sponsor B.Y.O. parties<br /><br />\nSaturday nights on weekends<br />\nwith no scheduled activities<br />\nwhere there would be a band, set<br />\nups, and perhaps student entertainment. I would establish a<br />\nHopkins humor magazine to provide a creative outlet for some<br />\nof our funny students. And I<br />\nwould like to see more money for<br />\nstudent activities.<br />\nOf course I can't promise to<br />\naccomplish all of this but I can<br />\npromise to work towards these<br />\ngoals with all my energies. I<br />\nthink that once again it will be<br />\npossible to have a potent Student Council, but it will require<br />\neffort on the part of the new<br />\ncouncil president, the entire<br />\ncouncil's support, and the interested participation and active<br />\nsupport of the student body.<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\nDaily 8 A.M. to 6 P.M.<br />\nMon., Thurs., Fri.

Today I got a letter from him<br />\nwhich I will reprint here because I know Mandolin's problems<br />\nare so much like your own. Mandolin writes:<br />\nDear Mandolin (he thinks my name is Mandolin too),<br />\nI see by the college paper that you are writing a column for<br />\nMarlboro Cigarettes. I think Marlboros are jim-dandy cigarettes with real nice tobacco and a ginger-peachy filter, and<br />\nI want to tell you why I don't smoke them.<br />\nIt all started the very first day I arrived at college. I was<br />\nwalking across the campus, swinging my paper valise and singing traditional airs like Blue Tail Fly and Death and Transfiguration, when all of a sudden I ran into this here collegiatelooking fellow with a monogram on his breast pocket. He asked<br />\nme was I a freshman. I said yes. He asked me did I want to<br />\nbe a BMOC and the envy of all the in crowd. I said yes. He<br />\nsaid the only way to make these keen things happen was to join<br />\na fraternity. Fortunately he happened to have a pledge card<br />\nwith him, so he pricked my thumb and I signed. He didn't tell<br />\nme the name of the fraternity or where it is located, but I suppose I'll find out when I go active.<br /><br />\n*Optional at extra cost.<br /><br />\nawearge too-eici(rz:516iiltaitz24<br />\nMeanwhile this fellow comes around every week to collect<br />\nthe dues, which are $100, plus a $10 fine for missing the weekly<br />\nmeeting, plus a $5 a.ssessment to buy a headstone for Spot, the<br />\nlate, beloved beagle who was the fraternity mascot.<br />\nI have never regretted joining the fraternity, because it is<br />\nmy dearest wish to be a BMOC and the envy of all the in<br />\ncrowd, but you can see that it is not cheap. It wouldn't be so<br />\nbad if I slept at the frat house, but you must agree that I can't<br />\nsleep at the house if I don't know where the house is.<br />\nI have rented a room which is not only grotesquely expensive, but it is not at all the kind of room I was looking for. I<br />\nwanted someplace reasonably priced, clean, comfortable, and<br />\nwithin easy walking distance of classes, the shopping district,<br />\nand San Francisco and New York. What I found was a bedroom<br />\nin the home of a local costermonger which is dingy, expensive,<br />\nand uncomfortable\u2014and I don't even get to use the bed till<br />\n7 a.m. when my landlord goes out to mong his costers.<br />\nWell anyhow, I got settled and the next thing.I did, naturally,<br />\nwas to look for a girl. And I found her. Harriet, her name is,<br />\nbeautiful creature standing just under seven feet high and weighing 385 pounds. I first spied her leaning against the statue of<br />\nthe Founder, dozing lightly. I talked to her for several hours<br />\nwithout effect. Only when I mentioned dinner did she stir. Her<br />\nmilky little eyes opened, she raised a brawny arm, seized my<br />\nnape, and carried me to a chic French restaurant called Le<br />\nClipjoint where she consumed, according to my calculations,<br />\nher own weight in chateaubriand.<br />\nAfter dinner she lapsed into a torpor from which I could not<br />\nrouse her, no matter how I tried. I banged my glass with a<br />\nfork, I pinched her great pendulous jowls, I rubbed the legs of<br />\nmy corduroy pants together. But nothing worked, and finally<br />\nI slang her over my shoulder and carried her to the girls dorm,<br />\nslipping several discs in the process.<br />\nFortunately, medical care for students is provided free at the<br />\ncollege infirmary. All I had to pay for were a few extras, like<br />\nX-rays, anaesthesia, forceps, hemostats, scalpels, catgut, linen,<br />\ntowels, amortization, and nurses. They would not, however,<br />\nlet me keep the nurses.<br />\nSo, dear cousin, it is lack of funds, not lack of enthusiasm,<br />\nthat is keeping me from Marlboro Cigarettes\u2014dear, good<br />\nMarlboros with their fine blend of choice tobaccos and their<br />\npure white Selectrate filter and their soft pack and their flip<br />\ntop box.<br />\nWell, I must close now.
