Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium.<br />\nMcFarlane's lecture was titled<br />\n\"The Balance of Power Between<br />\na Free Press and the National<br />\nSecurity Imperative.\" The lecture took place Tuesday at 8 p.m.<br />\nin Shriver Hall.<br />\nMcFarlane is known for his involvement in the sale of arms to<br />\nIran during his tenure as National<br />\nSecurity Advisor to President<br />\nReagan from 1983 to 1985. In a<br />\nreference to the scandal,<br />\nMcFarlane said that sometimes,<br />\nthe withholding of information in<br />\nthe name of national security is<br />\n\"an attempt to cover up [one's<br />\nown] mistakes.\"<br />\n\"The President must undertand the need to acknowledge<br />\nserious errors,\" he said, citing<br />\nthe exclusion of the European<br />\nallies from the Intermediate<br />\nRange Nuclear Force (INF) treaty negotiations with the Soviet<br />\nUnion as a serious error that the<br />\npress never mentioned.<br />\nThe Latin American Action<br />\nGroup held a protest outside<br />\nShriver in the cold and rain<br />\nbefore the lecture.

Students are complaining that, not only are phone-in pick-ups taking<br />\nfar too long, even posted library stops are frequently ignored by shuttle drivers.<br />\nAll the confusion may be caused by a number<br />\nof different factors. The addition of a second<br />\nvan last year might have led to a disproportionate increase in the number of service<br />\npatrons. Perhaps the drivers have been improperly trained in adhering to posted schedules<br />\nand boundaries.<br />\nIn any event, the efforts by last year's Student Council to secure another security van<br />\nhave been undermined by a drop in the quality<br />\nof shuttle service. The real concern is for the<br />\nlevel of security being provided as a result.<br />\nThe University provides undergrads with virtually no on-campus housing after their<br />\nfreshman year. Ideally, it should compensate<br />\nfor this by providing safe and convenient<br />\ntransportation within the Hopkins area\u2014be it<br />\nto a party or MSE.<br />\nThe reality is that the University's present<br />\nability to provide transportation is limited. Not<br />\neveryone can receive door-to-door service all<br />\nof the time. Given these limitations, the shuttle service's priority must be security.<br />\nThe shuttle system responsibly protects its<br />\npatrons. However, the University's responsibility extends beyond those who choose to<br />\ntake the shuttle. Should a lone traveller walk<br />\ninstead of take the shuttle because the wait is<br />\ntoo great, that traveller, too, is the University's responsibility.<br />\nA restructuring of the shuttle service is in<br />\norder to try and better accomodate for the safety<br />\n<br />\nof the more students. Perhaps, as they review<br />\nthe vans' performance over the semester,<br />\nsecurity officials will cosider using one of the<br />\nvans as a pre-routed mini-bus; it could make<br />\ndesignated stops at various points all the way<br />\nup though Charles Village and parts of Roland<br />\nPark and Hampden. Groups of travellers,<br />\narguably a large source of the shuttle's inefficiency, might be more inclined to use this<br />\nmethod of transportation. Their danger, should<br />\nthey have to walk a bit to reach a stop (many<br />\nof which could be indoors), is less than that of<br />\nthe individual.<br />\nThis would help alleviate the workload of the<br />\nother van, which would continue to receive<br />\ntelephoned pick-ups and library stops. Lone<br />\ntravellers would continue to use this service.<br />\nWith the load for this van lessened by the routed<br />\nbus, drivers could respond more quickly to<br />\ncalls\u2014and thereby encourage more students<br />\ntravelling alone to make use of the shuttle.<br />\nThe key to the success of this system might<br />\nlie with the purchase of another van or even<br />\na mini-bus. In this situation, the bus could make<br />\nthe pre-routed stops, with one van doing only<br />\nlibrary stops and the other accepting phone-in<br />\nstops. The recent expenditure on a van should<br />\nnot deter the University from this additional<br />\npurchase, should it be determined useful.<br />\nEven with only the two vans, this new<br />\nschedule might be more effective than the present system. It would encourage those who use<br />\nthe service more for convenience to use the<br />\nmini-bus, while providing an improved doorto-door service for those who should be concerned for their safety.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\ncontributing to the decline of the<br />\nRealizing that I was<br />\nA case of harrassment University.<br />\nnot going to give him the parkTo the Editor:<br />\ning space, he told me that he was<br />\ngoing to contact Johns Hopkins<br />\nOn Friday, November 6, 1987, University Security and the Dean<br />\nat approximately 12:30 p.m., I of Students to have me dealt with<br />\nhad a most unfortunate ex- immediately.<br />\nperience with a Johns Hopkins Well, professor, I submit to you<br />\nUniversity professor.

We spent the evening<br />\neating pizza and catching up on<br />\ngossip. I left at about 1:20 in<br />\norder to catch the escort van's<br />\n1:30 pick-up at the library. After<br />\nI had been waiting about fifteen<br />\nminutes, a roving monitor came<br />\nby and asked me if I was waiting<br />\nfor the shuttle. I told him I was<br />\n<br />\nhave no idea. I can't imagine that<br />\nthe number of people taking the<br />\nvan has gone up so much this year<br />\nthat scheduled library pick-ups<br />\nmust no be skipped. However, I<br />\ndid hear about a driver who took<br />\nsomeone out to Towson State. It<br />\nkind of makes you wonder,<br />\ndoesn't it? But whoever or whatever is to blame, whether it be the<br />\nadministration, the drivers, or<br />\n<br />\nKaren Richardson<br />\nand he left, returning a few<br />\nminutes later to tell me it would<br />\nbe there soon. At two o'clock,<br />\nafter seeing several campus<br />\nsecurity cars go whipping by the<br />\nlibrary, but no escort van, I left.<br />\nI walked back to the dorms fuming and had to sleep on my<br />\nfriend's couch. '<br />\nNow this was not an isolated<br />\nincident. Many people, including<br />\nmyself, have had numerous bad<br />\nexperiences with the escort van<br />\nthis semester. I have waited for<br />\nthe shuttle at the library for 50<br />\nminutes in the early evening (it<br />\ndid not come). My roommate has<br />\nmissed the van at our apartment<br />\nbecause the operator told her the<br />\nvan would be there in 30 minutes;<br />\nhowever, it arrived after only 15<br />\nminutes and immediately left, not<br />\nto return.<br />\nLast year when the University<br />\nbegan running a second van the<br />\nservice improved tremendously.<br />\nLibrary pick-ups were on time<br />\nand the shuttle would often stop<br />\nthere more than once every half<br />\nhour. Off-campus pick-ups were<br />\nquicker too; the van usually came<br />\nwithin ten minutes. It seemed like<br />\nan efficient way to run the escort<br />\nvan had finally been found.<br />\nSo what happened? I certainly<br />\n<br />\nsomething else, this problem is<br />\ninexcusable. We as students have<br />\nbeen told that a service is being<br />\nprovided for us. We are told that<br />\nif we are in a certain place at a<br />\ncertain time, there will be a van<br />\nthere to take us where we need to<br />\ngo. We arrange to comply with<br />\nposted schedules and pick-up<br />\ntimes given to us by Security, but<br />\nthen the escort van fails to show<br />\nup. So students are forced with a<br />\nchoice. Do we walk home (or<br />\nwherever we are going) alone<br />\nafter dark through streets we<br />\nknow are not safe, or do we wait<br />\nfor a van that may or may not<br />\ndecide to come?<br />\nOf course the University has no<br />\nlegal responsibility to provide an<br />\nescort van for its students, just as<br />\nit has no legal responsibility to<br />\nprovide other services, such as<br />\nthe medical school shuttle.<br />\nHowever, providing a comprehensive shuttle service is the<br />\nethical thing for Hopkins to do for<br />\nseveral reasons.

The report decried the<br />\nlack of gathering places, particularly those offering food service, at Homewood. Now one of<br />\nthe few is being closed. The<br />\nReport advocated measures to increase the sense of community<br />\namong the scattered off-campus<br />\npopulation. Now, a wellpatronized gathering spot with a<br />\npowerful spirit of JHU community and a location right in the heart<br />\nof Charles Village is lost. The<br />\nReport promoted ties between<br />\nfaculty, grads, and undergrads:<br />\nnow a traditional site for joint activities like the German Stammtisch is made unavailable. If the<br />\nDean of Students is sincere about<br />\nwishing to accept and act on the<br />\nadvice of the Human Climate<br />\nReport, he is certainly choosing<br />\na strange way of showing it.

I accompanied him to the bookstore<br />\nand we perused the selection.<br />\nThis is where I came up with the<br />\nidea for this week's column: The<br />\nBest at Hopkins to Buy in the<br />\nBookstore. I realized that there<br />\nwere so many esoteric items that<br />\nthere had to be some humor there<br />\nsomewhere. There are so many<br />\nbizzare things in that small space<br />\nthat I figured that someone had to<br />\nwrite about them, and I am the<br />\none.<br />\nWhere to begin? Well, just to<br />\nset the tone, how about the most<br />\ninexpensive item on this list, the<br />\nFunk and Wagnall's Family<br />\nLibrary of Great Music, which,<br />\nof course, is not a library at all,<br />\nbut only a solitary record. This<br />\nknocks in at a mere $1.95. Pretty small expense for the average<br />\nperson to have a complete library<br />\nin the home. Then there is the<br />\nPhysician's Desk Reference for a<br />\ntidy $32.95. This is definitely a<br />\ngood thing for Hopkins to carry,<br />\nfor I am sure that there are a<br />\nveritable plethora o' doctors out<br />\nthere who just happen to need a<br />\ndesk reference, and go to Barnes<br />\nand Noble to pick them up. I<br />\nmyself found it handy, as I<br />\nbrowsed through it and found half<br />\na dozen fatal illnesses to which I<br />\nhave the symptoms.<br />\nBehind the counter, where no<br />\nevil hands might grasp it and theft<br />\nit, lurks the incredible Texas Instruments TI-74 Programmable<br />\nCalculator, which will set you<br />\nback only an even $135.00. I<br />\ntried it out and used its exponential feature to figure out the<br />\nnumber of my faithful readers.<br />\nOne might use this calculator to<br />\ncount the funds in his or her Johns<br />\nHopkins Porcelain Piggy Bank,<br />\ncomplete with the JHU seal,<br />\nwhich fetches a mere $9.95.<br />\n<br />\nThe runner-up for the Best Item<br />\nto Buy in the Bookstore fits in<br />\ntune with my slow lifestyle. This<br />\nis, of course, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital Knitting Kit, which,<br />\ncomplete with such expensive accoutrements as yarn and a nettype pattern, sells for ony $20.00.<br />\nWhen I asked the Barnes and Noble manager Paul Lynch if he had<br />\nany personal favorites, he indicated that the Johns Hopkins<br />\nSeal Magnet, selling for $1.25,<br />\nwas a find and a half for anybody.<br />\nHe also said that no matter how<br />\nbizzare things appear in the<br />\nbookstore, you should see some<br />\nof the stuff that is not ordered,<br />\nsamples of which are sent to the<br />\nbookstore by various manufacturers. His personal favorite is the<br />\nset of elastic shoelaces, which<br />\nneed to be tied only once in a<br />\nlifetime. Unfortunately, because<br />\nthey anticipated a storm of shoppers if these things were carried,<br />\nthe bookstore chose not to order<br />\nthem.<br />\nMy favorite item in the whole<br />\nshootin' match was so nice that I<br />\nimmediately bought twelve sets<br />\nand put them in a safe deposit<br />\nbox. What else could be the Best<br />\nThing at Hopkins to Buy in the<br />\nBookstore except the incredible<br />\nJHU Blazer Button Set. This incredible set features four small<br />\nand three large brass colored buttons embossed with the Hopkins<br />\nSeal. I see it as designed for the<br />\nJHU Alumni executive who has<br />\nabsolutely everything else.

Ettle<br />\n\"I was walking along and a<br />\nblack lab ran up and playfully<br />\njumped on me. It didn't tackle me<br />\nor anything. It just jumped,\" said<br />\nfreshman Seth Hettena concerning an experience with a loose<br />\ndog on campus. \"I can see how<br />\npeople might be bothered by a<br />\ndog jumping on them. But it really didn't bother me,\" he said.<br />\nHettena's incident with the<br />\nunleashed dog typifies the experiences of other Hopkins faculty and students who have found<br />\nthemselves harrassed or even attacked by loose dogs on the<br />\nHomewood campus. An increase<br />\nin the number of' complaints<br />\nagainst unleashed dt)gs since<br />\n1983 caused Campus Security to<br />\nadopt the first ever dog policy<br />\nat Hopkins in July of 1985.<br />\nSimply put, the Homewood<br />\nDog Policy states that all dogs,<br />\nwhile on university property,<br />\n\"must be licensed, leashed, and<br />\nunder the control of their owners<br />\nat all times.\" Furthermore, dogs<br />\nare not permitted in \"common<br />\nareas of any university building\"<br />\nor allowed to \"be tied up and left<br />\nunattended anywhere on campus<br />\ngrounds.\" The policy also addresses the removal of animal excrement, citing the owners<br />\n<br />\nresponsible for waste deposited<br />\nby their animals.<br />\nHowever, since the adoption of<br />\nthe dog policy at Homewood in<br />\n1985, campus security has fully<br />\nenforced the law only four times,<br />\ndespite the numerous complaints<br />\nabout uncontrolled dogs, primarily on the Gilman/Upper Quad.<br />\nSecurity remains hesitant to<br />\ntake action against owners who<br />\npermit their dogs to run loose.<br />\n\"There isn't much we can do<br />\nwith loose dogs,\" said Major<br />\nRobert Larkin, chief of<br />\nHomewood security. Larkin<br />\nstressed the difficulty in investigating a complaint against a<br />\nloose dog, saying that most loose<br />\ndogs are gone once security arrives upon the scene. Larkin added. \"We're reluctant to do this<br />\n[enforce the dog policy] because<br />\ndogs are man's best friend and we<br />\nreally don't want to do<br />\nanything.\"<br />\nMany students find the dog<br />\npolicy unnecessary for various<br />\nreasons. Most freshmen, for example, enjoy seeing dogs loose on<br />\ncampus and feel that the presence<br />\nof the animals enhances the<br />\nuniversity atmosphere. \"I don't<br />\nmind dogs walking around,\" said<br />\nundergraduate Stephen Bretz.<br />\n\"You could say I communicate<br />\nwell with dogs.\" Freshman<br />\n<br />\nRichard Quarles agreed, saying<br />\nthat he \"loves the dogs\" and<br />\nlooks forward to seeing them<br />\naround campus.<br />\nOther students find the dog<br />\npolicy unnecessary because it is<br />\nnot consistently enforced at<br />\nHomewood. Hettena claims that<br />\nthe lax enforcement of the dog<br />\npolicy simply tells dog owners<br />\nthat security does not object to<br />\ndogs running loose. \"If you judge<br />\na law by how well it's enforced,<br />\nthen there is no leash law at<br />\nHopkins,\" said Hettena.<br />\nSophomore Jenny Levy, like<br />\nother dog owners, allows her bull<br />\nmastiff to run loose on campus<br />\n<br />\ngrounds only since \"no one ever<br />\nenforces it [the dog policy].\"<br />\nLarkin responded to these<br />\ncharges of insufficient enforcement by stating that Campus<br />\nSecurity indeed is not interested<br />\nin enforcing the dog policy. \"We<br />\nwant people who have.dogs to be<br />\naware of this problem,\" he said,<br />\nwe don't want to make an issue<br />\nof this policy and impound these<br />\ndogs. We would rather just have<br />\nthe owners comply and curb their<br />\ndogs themselves.\" Lai-kin added<br />\nthat students who see loose dogs<br />\n\"have every right\" to ask the<br />\nowner to leash his or her animal.<br />\n\"If that doesn't work, then they<br />\n<br />\nmay call security,\" he said.<br />\n\"This is the students' campus and<br />\nif we all don't take care of it, it<br />\nwill go downhill.\"<br />\nBretz, however, disagreed with<br />\nLarkin's attitude toward the<br />\npolicy. \"It's a worthless policy.<br />\nObviously, people just don't give<br />\na damn about it,\" he said. He<br />\nadded that since many students<br />\nenjoy seeing dogs on campus,<br />\nfew support the dog policy and<br />\npost complaints against the<br />\nanimals to security. Essentially, students on campus do not see<br />\nloose dogs as a threat and<br />\ntherefore do not actively support<br />\nthe policy.<br />\n<br />\n\f\u2022<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/15<br />\n<br />\nCrossword<br />\nACROSS<br />\n1 Church bench<br />\n4 Talk<br />\n9 Viper<br />\n12 A state: abbr.<br />\n13 Girl's name<br />\n14 Baker's product<br />\n15 Calling<br />\n17 Sandy waste<br />\n19 Have on one's<br />\nperson<br />\n21 Liquid measure:<br />\nabbr.<br />\n<br />\n22 Exact<br />\n25 Chart<br />\n27 Ceremony<br />\n31 Decay<br />\n32 Rules<br />\n34 Near<br />\n35 Old French coin<br />\n36 At present<br />\n37 Ancient Roman<br />\nweight<br />\n38 Praised<br />\n41 Peer Gynt's<br />\nmother<br />\n<br />\n42 Woody plant<br />\n43 Pekoe, e.g.<br />\n44 Matured<br />\n45 Indian mulberry<br />\n47 Heroic event<br />\n49 Pen for cattle<br />\n53 Comely<br />\n57 Tint<br />\n58 Pretentious<br />\nrural residence<br />\n60 Be in debt<br />\n61 Anger<br />\n62 Foreign<br />\n63 Vessel<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\nWeckly<br />\nCrossw rc<br />\nDuzzl<br />\n1<br />\n12<br />\n<br />\nDOWN<br />\n1 Moccasin<br />\n2 Guido's high<br />\nnote<br />\n3 Armed conflict<br />\n4 Pintail duck<br />\n5 Pre-eminent<br />\n6 Teutonic deity<br />\n7 Succor<br />\n8 Retain<br />\n9 Simian<br />\n10 Title of respect<br />\n11 Fondle<br />\n16 Female sheep<br />\n18 Stalk of grain<br />\n<br />\n20 Male sheep<br />\n22 Pamphlet<br />\n23 Moving part of<br />\nmotor<br />\n24 Guido's low<br />\nnote<br />\n26 Fruit<br />\n28 Italy: abbr.<br />\n29 Plague<br />\n30 Ancient chariot<br />\n32 Female deer<br />\n33 Bow<br />\n35 Besmirch<br />\n39 First person<br />\n40 River in<br />\nScotland<br />\n<br />\n41 Symbol for<br />\nsilver<br />\n44 High card<br />\n46 Volcanic<br />\nemanation<br />\n48 Country of Asia<br />\n49 Greek letter<br />\n50 Possessive<br />\npronoun<br />\n51 Female ruff<br />\n52 Girl's nickname<br />\n54 Cover<br />\n55 Couple<br />\n56 Still<br />\n59 Roman 51<br />\n<br />\n15<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nRU<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n22<br />\n<br />\n23<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n13UUU<br />\n17<br />\n18<br />\n<br />\n16<br />\n19<br />\n<br />\n24<br />\n<br />\nRU<br />\n<br />\n20<br />\n<br />\n25<br />\n<br />\n31<br />\n<br />\n21<br />\n26<br />\n<br />\n32<br />\n<br />\n27<br />\n33<br />\n<br />\n35<br />\n<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\nirt<br />\n<br />\n14<br />\n<br />\nRU<br />\nUUU<br />\n28<br />\n<br />\n29<br />\n<br />\n30<br />\n<br />\nRURU<br />\n<br />\n36<br />\n<br />\n37<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nN<br />\n42<br />\n<br />\nin<br />\n<br />\n40<br />\n<br />\nRUR<br />\n45<br />\n<br />\nNE 51<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n44<br />\n<br />\n46<br />\n<br />\nUR<br />\n58<br />\n<br />\nWe regret that we are unable to print the solution to last week's<br />\npuzzle.

As<br />\nbassist for that group, Ritchie has<br />\nalways been the visual interest,<br />\nwith his shaved head, and robes<br />\n<br />\ndecorated with religious folk art.<br />\nTonight, with his own band and<br />\na new solo album of songs to<br />\nplay, he seems content to limit his<br />\n\"wild\" wardrobe to a pair of<br />\njeans festooned with hand-drawn<br />\nfaces and flowers.<br />\nSo, anyway, there he is, looking like your average joe, and I'm<br />\nstarting to get nervous.

This was no<br />\nexception.<br />\nBut then Lester, Patron Saint of<br />\nRock Critics, looked down on me<br />\nand smiled. One of Ritchie's band<br />\ncomes over to the bar where<br />\nwe're sitting and asks if we have<br />\nany cigarettes. Her name is Cynthia Bartell, or Cindy as she introduced herself. She is the only<br />\nmusician who played on the<br />\nalbum who is also part of the<br />\ntouring band. We get to talking<br />\nabout a bunch of stuff, such as:<br />\nthe current tour (it's going well,<br />\nbut it's also tiring), her previous<br />\nmusical experiences (she's a<br />\nmember of the Tetes Noires), and<br />\nthe similarity in life styles between students and musicians<br />\n(neither of us get much sleep).<br />\nThen she introduces me to Brian<br />\nwho, it seems, already knows my<br />\nname.

The first is<br />\nHappy Nightmare Baby, from<br />\nOpal, just the thing for all you<br />\nretro-sixties types out there. This<br />\nisn't the pretty stuff, however.<br />\nThis album is more like the Doors<br />\non the worst trip ever.

This track still has that<br />\ncoolness, that simplicity, but it<br />\nhas almost a beatnik-jazz feel to<br />\nit. For those of you who really get<br />\ninto this, pick up a copy of Opal's<br />\nNorthern Line EP, which features<br />\ntwo songs in this \"lonesome<br />\nstranger\" vein, \"Empty Bottles,\" and the title track. My only real complaint is that I'd like<br />\nto hear more of this stuff, and a<br />\nlittle less of the psychedelia.. Ah,<br />\nbut beggars can't be choosers,<br />\nand neither can critics. For those<br />\nof you who want to catch Opal<br />\nlive, they're currently opening for<br />\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain (what<br />\ndoes that tell you?), with a slightly altered line-up, featuring Will<br />\nGlen (also of the Rain Parade) on<br />\nbass, and Keith Mitchell (Green<br />\non Red) as drummer. For those<br />\nof you who can't make the show,<br />\njust get out your favorite recreational substance, light some<br />\ncandles, and put on Happy<br />\nNightmare, Baby. I gah-run-tee<br />\nit'll be the end.<br />\nOkay, speaking of live shows,<br />\nI didn't see any of you all at the<br />\n8x 10 on Sunday night to catch<br />\nViolent Femmes bassist Brian<br />\nRitchie (and at the 8x10, it's pretty hard not to be seen). Too bad,<br />\n'cause you all missed a good<br />\nshow (eheck out Mark Stewart's<br />\nreview herein). No matter,<br />\nbecause you can hear at least part<br />\nof what you missed on his new<br />\nalbum, The Blend. And boy, will<br />\nyou be sorry.<br />\nAs might be expected from a<br />\nbass player, all of these tunes<br />\nhave a pretty tight groove, and<br />\nare sure to stick in your head for<br />\n<br />\nawhile. A couple of sure contenders are \"Alphabet,\" \"Doin'<br />\nthe Best We Can,\" and \"Days of<br />\nthe Blend,\" the latter being a particularly moody piece, but, tho'<br />\nit ain't happy, it sure is nice.<br />\nThose of you familiar with Ritchie and the Femmes, however,<br />\nknow that they don't always stick<br />\nto traditional pop structures. On<br />\nthis album Ritchie pulls a number<br />\nof sonically interesting rabbits out<br />\nof his hat, the best example being \"Austrian Ant Hill,\" Ritchie's sonic impression of just<br />\nthat. The recorder I can figure,<br />\nbut I'm just not sure about the<br />\nconch shells (there, that oughta<br />\npeak your interest). Ritchie draws<br />\non some real traditional forms for<br />\na couple of songs. \"John the<br />\nRevelator,\" which he describes,<br />\nas a 'gospel song,' manages to<br />\ncapture at least part of the spirit<br />\nof the gospel spiritual, while infusing it with a snappy hook and<br />\na good chunk o' funk. \"Rock of<br />\nAges\" was never like this. Finally, \"Nuclear War,\" a cover of a<br />\nsong by jazz-man Sun-Ra, will<br />\nprobably most please all the Femmes fans out there, both with it's<br />\nintensity and it's hell for leather<br />\nsound. Femmes fans will probably like this album the most,<br />\nbut for those of you who don't<br />\nmind listening to a guy taking,<br />\nsome chances, and actually pulling some of them off, you might<br />\nwanna give this a try.

Not me, I find them<br />\nextremely offensive. But then it<br />\noccurred to me that this movie<br />\nreally was a classic. When it<br />\ncame out in the early seventies,<br />\nit made an enormous impact. At<br />\nthe premiere ,at New York's<br />\nWorld Theatre were such<br />\nnotables as Johnny Carson. People were lined up to see the dirtiest movie ever made. It was<br />\nshocking, and therefore hip.<br />\n<br />\nDeep Throat made such an impact<br />\nthat Harry Reams (the doctor)<br />\nwas imprisoned in several states.<br />\nChristiano (Linda<br />\nLinda<br />\nLovelace) wrote her own account<br />\nof the filming of the movie,<br />\nclaiming to have been drugged<br />\nand held captive. She later went<br />\non a college lecture circuit talking about the gansterish nature of<br />\nthe pornography industry. She<br />\nbecame adamantly anti-sex and<br />\nanti-drug. So why did a movie<br />\nmade on a $25,000 budget grossmillions, and why is it still shown<br />\nat college campuses everywhere?<br />\nI. Plot Analysis: Yes, there is<br />\n<br />\na semblance of a plot. Linda<br />\nLovelace has unhappy sex, wants<br />\nsomething more, goes to see a<br />\n'doctor.' She finds out her<br />\nclitoris is not where it sho41 be,<br />\nbut in her throat. She says,<br />\n\"Well, I'll be damned,\" and<br />\nengages in oral sex so as to keep<br />\nthe fireworks and rockets going<br />\noff and the bells ringing. She<br />\ntakes a job as a nurse/prostitute,<br />\nand eventually decides she'll<br />\nmarry a guy who'll get himself<br />\nreduced to the perfect size. On<br />\nthe way, there are numerous explicitly documented sex scenes,<br />\nsome involving bizarre objects,<br />\n<br />\nAunt Dan and Lemon at Center Stage<br />\nby Amy Reiter<br />\nOur concept of theater has<br />\nchanged. Years ago, theater used to be called show business.<br />\nNowadays, it's called the entertainment industry. What's in a<br />\nname?<br />\nA<br />\nlot<br />\n(Sorry,<br />\nShakespeare). You see, both<br />\n\"business\" and \"industry\" identify the profit-making aspect of<br />\ntheater, though the latter is certainly more high-tech. The gulf of<br />\nmeaning lies between those first<br />\ntwo words,\"show\" and \"entertainment.\" Entertainment means<br />\nephemeral<br />\namusement,<br />\nsomething that takes your mind<br />\noff your troubles for two hours.<br />\nShow means something is revealed, the experience affects you in<br />\nsome way.<br />\nWallace Shawn's play Aunt<br />\nDan and Lemon at the Center<br />\nStage this month rejects the current definition of theater. No audience member leaves this show<br />\nthe same way he or she comes in.<br />\nThe play gives no answers,just<br />\na lot of questions. Our gentle interrogator is Lemon (Lily<br />\n<br />\nKnight), a young British woman<br />\nwho lives a very full and exciting<br />\nlife\u2014vicariously. \u2022 Speaking<br />\ndirectly to the audience, she tells<br />\nus how she doesn't like to leave<br />\nhome. Instead, she prefers to<br />\nwith<br />\nspend<br />\ntime<br />\nalone<br />\nmemories\u2014her own, those of her<br />\nAmerican Aunt Dan (Margaret<br />\nGibson), and those of people she<br />\nhas never met. With Lemon, the<br />\naudience is allowed to see a world<br />\nwhere excitement is constant and<br />\ncompassion is questionable.<br />\nUnconventionality abounds in<br />\nthis production. The lights never<br />\ndim to signal the beginning of the<br />\nplay. The audience is still talking<br />\nwhen Lemon walks on stage and<br />\nstrikes up a conversation. This<br />\nbrings the play right to us. The<br />\nrequisite barrier of darkness<br />\nwhich separates reality from fiction, audience from actor is<br />\nsuspended.<br />\nIn addition, there is no intermission. The audience is never<br />\nallowed to slip into the \"oh, this<br />\nis just a play\" mentality. From<br />\nthe moment the action begins, the<br />\naudience stays with it.

The<br />\nshouting at the screen is actually<br />\nthe loudest in anticipation, during<br />\nthe opening credits. After the initial fifteen minutes, people are<br />\nquiet, everyone realizes, it can't<br />\nget any worse, and hell, we've<br />\n<br />\ngot to watch it now.<br />\n4. Cinematography: All the<br />\nshots are in harsh white light, so<br />\nas to leave no part unexamined.<br />\nAll the action is portrayed in close<br />\nup body parts, detached from the<br />\npeople.

Alfred A. Knopf,<br />\n$18.95. 399 pp.<br />\nby Mary Ginder<br />\nIn the beginning, Glittering Images seems to be something entirely new for Howatch. Instead<br />\nof her typical family saga<br />\ncentered around a British family<br />\nto the manor born, Howatch gives<br />\nus a novel that spans only a few<br />\nweeks in the summer of 1937.<br />\nThe protagonist, Charles<br />\nAshworth, is an Anglican<br />\nminister and theologian, who is<br />\ndispatched by his former mentor,<br />\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury, on<br />\na bit of ecclesiastical espionage.<br />\nIt hardly sounds like the stuff<br />\nof which Howatch novels are<br />\nmade. Where are the dark<br />\nsecrets, the perversions, the<br />\nmadness, the obsessions that<br />\nhaunt the typical Howatch family? Glittering Images may be a<br />\n\"dramatic new departure\" for<br />\nHowatch, but did she manage to<br />\nbring along the well-traveled baggage of novels past. Readers of<br />\nher earlier books, especially The<br />\nWheel ofFortune, will find much<br />\nthat is familiar in this new novel.<br />\nAshworth is asked by the Archbishop to pay a short visit to the<br />\n'Bishop of Starbridge, Adam Jardine, in order to determine<br />\n<br />\nwhether the Bishop's unusual living arrangements could prove<br />\nscandalous to the Church. The<br />\nArchbishop is concerned that the<br />\ncharismatic Jardine is having an<br />\naffair with his wife's young companion, Lyle Christie. Jardine's<br />\nwife Carrie is pretty but nervous<br />\nand not very bright; the beautiful<br />\nand capable Lyle seems much<br />\nmore Jardine's ideal wife. The<br />\nArchbishop is not the only one to<br />\nquestion Lyle's status as spinster<br />\nin the Jardine household, particularly since Jardine already has<br />\na reputation for charm with the<br />\nladies.<br />\nEnter Charles Ashworth. Upon<br />\narriving at Starbridge, Ashworth<br />\nimmediately feels a strong attraction to Lyle. In between attempts<br />\nat seducing her, Ashworth continues his rather inept investigation of Jardine's character and<br />\nrelationship with Lyle. He now<br />\nfaces a dilemma that is both<br />\nspiritual and emotional: he wants<br />\nto believe that his beloved Lyle<br />\nis not having an affair with the<br />\nBishop and at the same time<br />\nwants to prove that the Bishop is<br />\nhaving an affair with her in order<br />\nto prove that the Bishop, like<br />\nhimself, is capable of great sin,<br />\nyet can still serve God as a<br />\nminister.<br />\nThis dilemma pushes Ashworth<br />\ninto a severe spiritual crisis.

Dr. Walker's discussion of<br />\n\"Adaptation .and Human Evolution\" was the first lecture of the<br />\nWilliam Henry Welch Lecture<br />\nSeries. Dr. Walker and his colleagues have discovered and<br />\nreconstructed the oldest known<br />\nHomo Erectus skeleton. Through<br />\ncomparisons between our closest<br />\nknown ancestor, Homo Erectus,<br />\nand ourselves, Dr. Walker explains his theories on adaptation<br />\nand the nature of evolution.<br />\nDr. Walker asserts that<br />\nalthough most evolutionary processes serve a purpose, that purpose may not be the intended one,<br />\nand the result may be the byproduct of other evolutionary<br />\nprocesses. Just by inspection of<br />\nour nearest living relative, the<br />\nchimpanzee, we can see that,<br />\nalthough our genetic material<br />\n(DNA] is 99% the same, morphologically, we are completely<br />\ndifferent. To study the changes in<br />\nevolution from Homo Erectus to<br />\nHomo Sapiens, Dr. Walker<br />\nbrings the reconstructed skeleton<br />\nas an example.<br />\nThe skeleton is that of a twelve<br />\nyear old male, found in Kenya.<br />\nIt is quite completely reconstructed, and found to be approximately 1.6 million years old. According to Dr. Walker, this fossil<br />\nshows that \"evolution proceeds<br />\nas a mosaic,\" meaning that adap-<br />\n<br />\ntation occurs selectively\u2014<br />\ndifferent changes occur in different times on the evolutionary<br />\nscale. For example, this model of<br />\nHomo Erectus has conflicting<br />\ncharacteristics that correspond<br />\nboth to Homo Sapiens and to<br />\nHomo Erectus' own ancestor,<br />\nRobust Australopithicenes. He is<br />\ndimorphic, meaning the morphological differences between<br />\nthe male and female of the<br />\nspecies, like Homo Sapiens, but<br />\nhis cranial capacity and shovellike teeth are similar to Robust<br />\nAustralopithicenes.<br />\nDr. Walker also expressed<br />\nother interesting features of the<br />\n\"boy fossil,\" and related them to<br />\nhis view of evolution and adaptation. He noted that the boy<br />\nwould have grown to be well over<br />\nsix feet tall. This and other<br />\nevidence leads us to believe that,<br />\non the average, our ancestors<br />\nwere taller than we are. This<br />\nmakes sense, says Dr. Walker,<br />\nbecause we are, or have been<br />\nessentially an agricultural population. Therefore, all of our food<br />\nresources depend on one thing,<br />\nwhich can be destroyed by floods<br />\nor drought. Due to this fact, we<br />\nmust be smaller to survive.<br />\nHeight is also a factor of the environment in which a population<br />\nlives. People at the equator are<br />\ngenerally taller than those at the<br />\npoles because the \"equitorial\"<br />\npeople need a large surface to<br />\nenable the body to lose more heat.<br />\nThe \"polar\" people retain heat<br />\nthrough less surface area. This is<br />\nan example of adaptation through<br />\nevolution, that is not related to a<br />\ngenetic change.<br />\n<br />\nThe \"giant compromise\" in<br />\nsurvival that Dr. Walker<br />\ndiscusses is best shown in the<br />\ndistance between femurs in the<br />\nleg. If the distance between the<br />\nbones is short, then the<br />\nmechanical efficiency of walking<br />\nis increased, but the pelvic area<br />\nwould be smaller. Human infants<br />\nare born with a large brain compared to other species, and<br />\ntherefore need a large birth canal.<br />\nDr. Walker asserts that the large<br />\npelvic area and decreased walking efficiency is a compromise in<br />\nadaptative evolution that allows<br />\nhumans to be born with larger<br />\nbrains.<br />\nDr. Walker ultimately elucidated his point with a picture from<br />\na recent American Express advertisement. In the ad, Willie<br />\nShoemaker, a short white jockey,<br />\nstands back to back with Wilt<br />\nChamberlain, a tall black basketball player. An outside observer<br />\nmight think that the two belong to<br />\ndifferent species, because of their<br />\nlarge differences in morphology;<br />\nhowever, of course they are both<br />\nhuman. Dr. Walker believes that<br />\nour culture is the driving force<br />\nbehind our humanism. When an<br />\ninfant is born, it has only half of<br />\nits eventual brain weight. In the<br />\nfirst year of life, the baby continues the fast fetal growth rate,<br />\nSO in effect, \"humans have a<br />\ntwenty one month gestation<br />\nperiod\u2014nine months in the womb<br />\nand twelve months outside,\"<br />\nWalker says. This is why he<br />\nbelieves that the first year of a<br />\nbaby's life is the most important<br />\nof childhood. It is in this period<br />\nof time that the child absorbs<br />\n<br />\nTense? Try acupuncture<br />\nby Volney Sheen<br />\nAcupuncture has often evoked<br />\nan aura of the unknown. Its<br />\nsecrets have been clouded by the<br />\nmystique of the Orient where<br />\nsome 5000 years have passed<br />\nsince the initial development of<br />\nthe methods of this hidden art.<br />\nThough acupuncture may gain little or no support from Western<br />\nmedicine and has generally been<br />\nconsidered as a therapeutic cult,<br />\nits benefits have been widespread<br />\nand successful. The transition of<br />\nacupuncture from the Far East to<br />\nthe United States has led to slight<br />\nalterations in technique. Developed by Dr. Cerney, acupressure<br />\nrelies upon the same \"pressure<br />\npoints\" used in acupuncture<br />\nwithout the actual insertion of the<br />\nneedles. Its therapeutic procedures thus have been applied by<br />\nthe novice.<br />\nAs the Hopkins student normally experiences the feeling of<br />\nfatigue and tension, perhaps a<br />\ngeneral<br />\ndiscussion<br />\nof<br />\nacupressure's solution to such a<br />\nproblem would provide a superficial understanding of this article's topic. Dr.Cerney suggests<br />\nthat one should proceed in a kind<br />\n<br />\n.of self-treatment which can help<br />\nin ridding the body of its \"toxic<br />\nwaste\" and set the ch'i (energy)<br />\nflowing in the meridians. One<br />\nshould first run a tension test by<br />\ninserting the right index finger into the hollow behind the right ear<br />\nlobe. Rotate. If pain exists, the individual is tense. The second test<br />\nbegins by placing the head toward<br />\none shoulder. On the exposed<br />\nside, the fingers should run firmly<br />\ndown the muscle to the base of<br />\nthe skull. Little bumps, hard and<br />\nround in texture, may be felt.<br />\nThese represent the \"knots of<br />\ntension\" and each is a \"point of<br />\nfatigue.\" This routing is then<br />\nrepeated for the opposite side of<br />\nthe neck. As these tension areas<br />\nhave been located, the fingertips<br />\ncan then acupress the knots until ,<br />\nthey disappear. A third key spot<br />\ncan be located by moving up the<br />\nbase of the skull to its insertion.<br />\nAgain a somewhat swollen and<br />\nsoft bump should be felt. By placing the third fingers of each hand<br />\non this region and gently pressing and rotating, tension should<br />\nbe alleviated.<br />\nThough the preliminary steps<br />\nmay ease tension, it is the hollow<br />\nat the base of the skull which in<br />\n<br />\nacupressure is the true \"vitalitygenerating\" point. Oriental charts<br />\nlabel this area as the Gv-16 or the<br />\n16th acupuncture point in the<br />\nGoverning vessel meridian. This<br />\narea lies just opposite the medulla<br />\noblongata and is believed to<br />\nstimulate the body into sustaining<br />\naction. As the medulla oblongata<br />\nis generally responsible for<br />\nrespiratory and cardiovascular<br />\nfunctions, acupressure seems to<br />\nallow a direct line of contact with<br />\nthis region of the brain. The<br />\nthumbs should be placed in this<br />\nhollow at the base of the skull and<br />\nslight pressure applied.<br />\nThough such methods in acupressure are skeptical, they do<br />\nprovide perhaps not an alternative<br />\nbut a supplement to the accepted<br />\nstandard of Western medicine.<br />\nOne should by all means consult<br />\na doctor in cases of ill health but<br />\nacupressure may again lessen the<br />\ndiscomfort to a degree or at least<br />\nprovide some psychological uplifting. The results will inevitable<br />\nvary from individual to individual.<br />\nThe information from this article was taken from Acupuncture<br />\nWithout Needles by J.V.Cervey.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Alan Walker, professor of anatomy and cell biology here at Hopkins<br />\ndiscussed evolution at the first in a series of lectures.<br />\nmost from its surroundings, and<br />\nbegins to adapt.

In order to gain the title,<br />\nMarean surpassed 22 runners that<br />\nhad beaten him in previous dual<br />\nmeets. Head coach James Grogan<br />\nstated, \"I expected him to catch<br />\nfour or five of those runners but<br />\nnot 22 of them.\"<br />\nThe race, at Belmont Plate&<br />\nFairmount Park, consisted of<br />\nmany downhills, a feature that<br />\nMarean exploited with his long<br />\nstrides. The mild and windy<br />\nweather conditions on the day of<br />\nthe meet also contributed to his<br />\nsuccess. The critical moment during race came at the three-mile<br />\nmark when Marean passed the<br />\ntwo leaders and went on to win.<br />\nOn his performance through the<br />\nseason, Marean stated that he<br />\n\"learned to speed up in the beginning and tried to get in better<br />\nshape to avoid the burnoff three<br />\nmiles into the race.\" He began<br />\ntraining in mid-summer and has<br />\n'peaked at the right time.\"<br />\nNeither Grogan nor Marean<br />\n<br />\nexpected a first place finish. \"I<br />\nwas pleasantly shocked,\" noted<br />\nGrogan. \"I didn't expect him to<br />\nwin but to do well.\"<br />\nMarean added, \"I really<br />\nwasn't planning on winning it.\"<br />\nRunning without the pressure of<br />\nhaving to win helped him to relax<br />\nand perform well in his race.<br />\nWhen he eventually gained the<br />\nlead, his training to respond<br />\nunder pressure aided his effort to<br />\nmaintain his lead.<br />\nBorn in Geneseo, New York,<br />\nTim Marean grew up under conditions that would lead to his<br />\nfuture activity as a runner.<br />\nGeneseo provided a locale with<br />\nan outdoor environment conducive to running; his family supported and encouraged him. His<br />\nfather, a runner before running<br />\nbecame fashionable, influenced<br />\nMarean into running at age seven.<br />\nSerious training began at age thirteen and he ran in his first road<br />\nrace one year later. Running only track in high school, his exposure to cross country came<br />\nwhen he arrived at Hopkins. He<br />\nholds his high school's records in<br />\nthe mile and two mile. Indications<br />\nof future success occurred when<br />\nhe placed third in the MAC conference as a freshman in the 5000<br />\nmeter run. At a camp in Fort<br />\nBragg, North Carolina the past<br />\n<br />\nsummer, he broke the record for<br />\nthe one and two-mile runs.<br />\nMarean arrived at Johns<br />\nHopkins on an ROTC scholarship.<br />\nAs a chemistry major, he currently plans to go to medical school.<br />\nA warm personality, Marean<br />\ncredits part of his success to the<br />\nsupport he has received from the<br />\npeople around him. \"The cross<br />\ncountry team has good personalities, always ready to crack<br />\na joke or lend a hand,\" stated<br />\nMarean. \"The team was ready at<br />\nthe finish and carried me off to<br />\nthe trophy.\"<br />\nOut of the field of 23 teams, the<br />\nteam finished in eigth place (234<br />\npoints), rising from last year's<br />\nninth place finish. The team improved steadily through the<br />\nseason and gained ground on<br />\nteams that they had previously<br />\nfaced this season before the<br />\nchampionship. Scott Baker and<br />\nMark Melia turned in good performances in \"beating -people<br />\nthey shouldn't have beaten.\" Eric<br />\nEspenhorst, Erik Schweitzer,<br />\nMark Melia, Dan Dairaghi, and<br />\nChris Crosby rounded out the<br />\nseven Hopkins runners. Teamwise, Haverford finished first(27<br />\npts), followed by Ursinus.(119<br />\npts) and Franklin and Marshall<br />\n(125 pts).<br />\nOn his victory, Marean felt<br />\n<br />\n\"astonished\" but trained greatly<br />\nto reach his goal. Marean explained that he \"set a goal of running success and kept working<br />\ntoward it.\"<br />\n\"I expected this [victory] when<br />\nI was thirteen but I had problems<br />\nwith injuries. .1 spent most of<br />\nthe time waiting to develop.

The regatta was the first head race ever<br />\nrowed by the crew, and the<br />\nrowers had never raced as far as<br />\nthe 3 /<br />\n1<br />\n2 miles the course demanded. The crews, though, were able<br />\nto stay together throughout the<br />\nlength of the race, and their efforts produced several top<br />\nfinishes for the team.<br />\nThe men's novice lightweight<br />\n8-man \"A\" boat won its race by<br />\nfinishing ahead of9 other teams.<br />\nThe shell overpowered such competition as George Mason University, the Baltimore Rowing Club,<br />\nand West Virginia University to<br />\nwin its event by 46 seconds.<br />\nStroke Steve Lin set the pace for<br />\nthe shell, with Pat Gorman, Ram<br />\nKumar, Paul Dietrich, John<br />\nShoe, Jim Nagy, Rob Porcarelli,<br />\nand Chris McColl.supplying ad-<br />\n<br />\nditional power. Coxswain Chuck<br />\nConnely successfully steered the<br />\nboat over a difficult course.<br />\nThe men's novice 4-man shell<br />\nalso placed well in its race.<br />\nAlthough the crew was slowed<br />\ndown by having to use heavy,<br />\nwooden oars, the boat still<br />\nmanaged to place second in a field<br />\nof 7. The rowers finished only 8<br />\nseconds behind the first place<br />\nteam, despite their handicap.<br />\nStroke for the shell was Bart<br />\nTaylor, with Dan Taylor, Thom<br />\nJohnson, and Steve Blank also<br />\nrowing in the shell. The boat's<br />\ncoxswain was Christy Kulich.<br />\nTwo other shells also rowed in<br />\nthe regatta and turned in respectable performances, although<br />\nboth shells suffered from limited<br />\npractice time. The men's junior<br />\nvarsity 4-man boat, which had<br />\nbeen able to practice only 2-3<br />\ndays a week due to equipment<br />\nshortage, finished near the middle of a field of9 rowers. Stroke<br />\n<br />\nfor the shell was Sean Kennedy,<br />\nwith Jeff Gold, T.C. Ondracek,<br />\nand Marc Boulay also rowing in<br />\nthe boat. The shell's coxswain<br />\nwas Beth Merchant. The men's<br />\nnovice lightweight 8-man \"B\"<br />\nboat suffered from recent personnel changes, so its rowers had not<br />\npracticed together much before<br />\nthe race. Stroke for the boat was<br />\nEric Eller, with Matt Janopaul,<br />\nJohn Einhaus, Justin Hott,<br />\nViveke Chaturvedi, Mike<br />\nNeufield, John DeRosimo, and<br />\nGlen Ingebretson rowing in the<br />\nshell. The boat's coxswain was<br />\nWonjae Choi.<br />\nThe crew has one more regatta<br />\nleft in its fall season. On<br />\nNovember 21, it will row against<br />\nschools from throughout the East<br />\nCoast and Midwest in the<br />\nPhiladelphia Frostbite Regatta.<br />\nThe competition will be the<br />\nstrongest the crew has faced this<br />\nyear and should provide a good<br />\ntest of the crew's preparation.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/21<br />\n<br />\nDanny's<br />\nEdge<br />\nCoaches, this one's for you. . .<br />\nDon't really know how to start<br />\nthis one, so I'll just state my<br />\nthoughts.

Boyer, the foundation's president, says<br />\nin a foreword to the report: \"Elevating teachers<br />\nand teaching to a higher position in the hierarchy<br />\nof the academic profession, while sustaining and<br />\nenriching the tradition of scholarship and research,<br />\nis one of the urgent problems confronting higher<br />\neducation.<br />\nThe nation's research universities are in the best<br />\nposition to lead the effort, he says.<br />\n\"These institutions not only have acquired a reputation, usually unfairly, for undervaluing teaching, they are at the top of the prestige ladder and<br />\nthey are most likely to be watched and emulated,\"<br />\nMr. Boyer says. The 360-page study\u2014The Academic Life: Small Worlds, Different Worlds\u2014is<br />\nbased on interviews conducted three years ago with<br />\nabout 200 faculty members from 16 colleges and<br />\nuniversities. It was written by Burton R. Clark,<br />\na professor of education and sociology at the<br />\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles.<br />\nThe report is the second in two years by the<br />\nfoundation to describe widespread dissatisfaction<br />\namong faculty members.<br />\nAmong the conclusions in the latest report:<br /><br />\nMPromotions are often decided more on seniority than on teaching ability and scholarly merit.<br />\nMGood teachers who spend a lot of time with<br />\nstudents are seen by colleagues as having misguided academic goals.<br />\n111Movement between sectors of higher education is often difficult, if not impossible.<br />\nThe report says colleges and universities too<br />\noften reward faculty members who have not put<br />\nforth enough effort in the classroom.<br />\n\"The greatest paradox of academic work in<br />\nmodern America is that most professor*._teach most<br />\nof the time, and large proportions of them teach<br />\nall the time, but teaching is not the activity most<br />\nrewarded by the academic profession nor most<br />\nvalued by the system at large,\" Mr. Clark writes.<br />\nThe increasing use of part-time instructors is<br />\nanother symptom of the low priority that many institutions place on teaching, the report says. Those<br />\ninstructors, no matter how knowledgeable, are not<br />\nregarded as full members of the campus community and are not compensated as such, it adds.<br />\nHierarchies Condemned<br />\nThe academic profession is permeated by strict<br />\nhierarchies, which rank not only institutions, but<br />\ndisciplines, faculty positions, and tasks, the report<br />\nsays.

Students are complaining that, not only are phone-in pick-ups taking<br />\nfar too long, even posted library stops are frequently ignored by shuttle drivers.<br />\nAll the confusion may be caused by a number<br />\nof different factors. The addition of a second<br />\nvan last year might have led to a disproportionate increase in the number of service<br />\npatrons. Perhaps the drivers have been improperly trained in adhering to posted schedules<br />\nand boundaries.<br />\nIn any event, the efforts by last year's Student Council to secure another security van<br />\nhave been undermined by a drop in the quality<br />\nof shuttle service. The real concern is for the<br />\nlevel of security being provided as a result.<br />\nThe University provides undergrads with virtually no on-campus housing after their<br />\nfreshman year. Ideally, it should compensate<br />\nfor this by providing safe and convenient<br />\ntransportation within the Hopkins area\u2014be it<br />\nto a party or MSE.<br />\nThe reality is that the University's present<br />\nability to provide transportation is limited. Not<br />\neveryone can receive door-to-door service all<br />\nof the time. Given these limitations, the shuttle service's priority must be security.<br />\nThe shuttle system responsibly protects its<br />\npatrons. However, the University's responsibility extends beyond those who choose to<br />\ntake the shuttle. Should a lone traveller walk<br />\ninstead of take the shuttle because the wait is<br />\ntoo great, that traveller, too, is the University's responsibility.<br />\nA restructuring of the shuttle service is in<br />\norder to try and better accomodate for the safety<br /><br />\nof the more students. Perhaps, as they review<br />\nthe vans' performance over the semester,<br />\nsecurity officials will cosider using one of the<br />\nvans as a pre-routed mini-bus; it could make<br />\ndesignated stops at various points all the way<br />\nup though Charles Village and parts of Roland<br />\nPark and Hampden. Groups of travellers,<br />\narguably a large source of the shuttle's inefficiency, might be more inclined to use this<br />\nmethod of transportation. Their danger, should<br />\nthey have to walk a bit to reach a stop (many<br />\nof which could be indoors), is less than that of<br />\nthe individual.<br />\nThis would help alleviate the workload of the<br />\nother van, which would continue to receive<br />\ntelephoned pick-ups and library stops. Lone<br />\ntravellers would continue to use this service.<br />\nWith the load for this van lessened by the routed<br />\nbus, drivers could respond more quickly to<br />\ncalls\u2014and thereby encourage more students<br />\ntravelling alone to make use of the shuttle.<br />\nThe key to the success of this system might<br />\nlie with the purchase of another van or even<br />\na mini-bus. In this situation, the bus could make<br />\nthe pre-routed stops, with one van doing only<br />\nlibrary stops and the other accepting phone-in<br />\nstops. The recent expenditure on a van should<br />\nnot deter the University from this additional<br />\npurchase, should it be determined useful.<br />\nEven with only the two vans, this new<br />\nschedule might be more effective than the present system. It would encourage those who use<br />\nthe service more for convenience to use the<br />\nmini-bus, while providing an improved doorto-door service for those who should be concerned for their safety.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\ncontributing to the decline of the<br />\nRealizing that I was<br />\nA case of harrassment University.<br />\nnot going to give him the parkTo the Editor:<br />\ning space, he told me that he was<br />\ngoing to contact Johns Hopkins<br />\nOn Friday, November 6, 1987, University Security and the Dean<br />\nat approximately 12:30 p.m., I of Students to have me dealt with<br />\nhad a most unfortunate ex- immediately.<br />\nperience with a Johns Hopkins Well, professor, I submit to you<br />\nUniversity professor.

We spent the evening<br />\neating pizza and catching up on<br />\ngossip. I left at about 1:20 in<br />\norder to catch the escort van's<br />\n1:30 pick-up at the library. After<br />\nI had been waiting about fifteen<br />\nminutes, a roving monitor came<br />\nby and asked me if I was waiting<br />\nfor the shuttle. I told him I was<br /><br />\nhave no idea. I can't imagine that<br />\nthe number of people taking the<br />\nvan has gone up so much this year<br />\nthat scheduled library pick-ups<br />\nmust no be skipped. However, I<br />\ndid hear about a driver who took<br />\nsomeone out to Towson State. It<br />\nkind of makes you wonder,<br />\ndoesn't it? But whoever or whatever is to blame, whether it be the<br />\nadministration, the drivers, or<br /><br />\nKaren Richardson<br />\nand he left, returning a few<br />\nminutes later to tell me it would<br />\nbe there soon. At two o'clock,<br />\nafter seeing several campus<br />\nsecurity cars go whipping by the<br />\nlibrary, but no escort van, I left.<br />\nI walked back to the dorms fuming and had to sleep on my<br />\nfriend's couch. '<br />\nNow this was not an isolated<br />\nincident. Many people, including<br />\nmyself, have had numerous bad<br />\nexperiences with the escort van<br />\nthis semester. I have waited for<br />\nthe shuttle at the library for 50<br />\nminutes in the early evening (it<br />\ndid not come). My roommate has<br />\nmissed the van at our apartment<br />\nbecause the operator told her the<br />\nvan would be there in 30 minutes;<br />\nhowever, it arrived after only 15<br />\nminutes and immediately left, not<br />\nto return.<br />\nLast year when the University<br />\nbegan running a second van the<br />\nservice improved tremendously.<br />\nLibrary pick-ups were on time<br />\nand the shuttle would often stop<br />\nthere more than once every half<br />\nhour. Off-campus pick-ups were<br />\nquicker too; the van usually came<br />\nwithin ten minutes. It seemed like<br />\nan efficient way to run the escort<br />\nvan had finally been found.<br />\nSo what happened? I certainly<br /><br />\nsomething else, this problem is<br />\ninexcusable. We as students have<br />\nbeen told that a service is being<br />\nprovided for us. We are told that<br />\nif we are in a certain place at a<br />\ncertain time, there will be a van<br />\nthere to take us where we need to<br />\ngo. We arrange to comply with<br />\nposted schedules and pick-up<br />\ntimes given to us by Security, but<br />\nthen the escort van fails to show<br />\nup. So students are forced with a<br />\nchoice. Do we walk home (or<br />\nwherever we are going) alone<br />\nafter dark through streets we<br />\nknow are not safe, or do we wait<br />\nfor a van that may or may not<br />\ndecide to come?<br />\nOf course the University has no<br />\nlegal responsibility to provide an<br />\nescort van for its students, just as<br />\nit has no legal responsibility to<br />\nprovide other services, such as<br />\nthe medical school shuttle.<br />\nHowever, providing a comprehensive shuttle service is the<br />\nethical thing for Hopkins to do for<br />\nseveral reasons.

It provided a fine opportunity for<br />\nundergrads to meet grads and<br />\ndiscover what graduate life was<br />\nabout; moreover, it was one of<br />\nthe few places an under-21 year<br /><br />\nJHU Human Climate Task Force<br />\nReport. The report decried the<br />\nlack of gathering places, particularly those offering food service, at Homewood. Now one of<br />\nthe few is being closed. The<br />\nReport advocated measures to increase the sense of community<br />\namong the scattered off-campus<br />\npopulation. Now, a wellpatronized gathering spot with a<br />\npowerful spirit of JHU community and a location right in the heart<br />\nof Charles Village is lost. The<br />\nReport promoted ties between<br />\nfaculty, grads, and undergrads:<br />\nnow a traditional site for joint activities like the German Stammtisch is made unavailable. If the<br />\nDean of Students is sincere about<br />\nwishing to accept and act on the<br />\nadvice of the Human Climate<br />\nReport, he is certainly choosing<br />\na strange way of showing it.

I accompanied him to the bookstore<br />\nand we perused the selection.<br />\nThis is where I came up with the<br />\nidea for this week's column: The<br />\nBest at Hopkins to Buy in the<br />\nBookstore. I realized that there<br />\nwere so many esoteric items that<br />\nthere had to be some humor there<br />\nsomewhere. There are so many<br />\nbizzare things in that small space<br />\nthat I figured that someone had to<br />\nwrite about them, and I am the<br />\none.<br />\nWhere to begin? Well, just to<br />\nset the tone, how about the most<br />\ninexpensive item on this list, the<br />\nFunk and Wagnall's Family<br />\nLibrary of Great Music, which,<br />\nof course, is not a library at all,<br />\nbut only a solitary record. This<br />\nknocks in at a mere $1.95. Pretty small expense for the average<br />\nperson to have a complete library<br />\nin the home. Then there is the<br />\nPhysician's Desk Reference for a<br />\ntidy $32.95. This is definitely a<br />\ngood thing for Hopkins to carry,<br />\nfor I am sure that there are a<br />\nveritable plethora o' doctors out<br />\nthere who just happen to need a<br />\ndesk reference, and go to Barnes<br />\nand Noble to pick them up. I<br />\nmyself found it handy, as I<br />\nbrowsed through it and found half<br />\na dozen fatal illnesses to which I<br />\nhave the symptoms.<br />\nBehind the counter, where no<br />\nevil hands might grasp it and theft<br />\nit, lurks the incredible Texas Instruments TI-74 Programmable<br />\nCalculator, which will set you<br />\nback only an even $135.00.

This<br />\nis, of course, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital Knitting Kit, which,<br />\ncomplete with such expensive accoutrements as yarn and a nettype pattern, sells for ony $20.00.<br />\nWhen I asked the Barnes and Noble manager Paul Lynch if he had<br />\nany personal favorites, he indicated that the Johns Hopkins<br />\nSeal Magnet, selling for $1.25,<br />\nwas a find and a half for anybody.<br />\nHe also said that no matter how<br />\nbizzare things appear in the<br />\nbookstore, you should see some<br />\nof the stuff that is not ordered,<br />\nsamples of which are sent to the<br />\nbookstore by various manufacturers. His personal favorite is the<br />\nset of elastic shoelaces, which<br />\nneed to be tied only once in a<br />\nlifetime. Unfortunately, because<br />\nthey anticipated a storm of shoppers if these things were carried,<br />\nthe bookstore chose not to order<br />\nthem.<br />\nMy favorite item in the whole<br />\nshootin' match was so nice that I<br />\nimmediately bought twelve sets<br />\nand put them in a safe deposit<br />\nbox. What else could be the Best<br />\nThing at Hopkins to Buy in the<br />\nBookstore except the incredible<br />\nJHU Blazer Button Set. This incredible set features four small<br />\nand three large brass colored buttons embossed with the Hopkins<br />\nSeal.

When I left<br />\nthe shelter that night, he was<br />\nsleeping fitfully on the floor. I<br />\nwatched him, and hoped that the<br />\nnext time I met Micheal, we'd be<br />\nsomewhere on Pratt Street, and<br />\nhe'd be smiling as he asked me<br />\nto write a story about his new<br />\nbaby boy.<br /><br />\nLittle More Leeway<br />\nLEE, from 9<br />\nup. He planned to enter college<br />\nas soon as he could. He made it<br />\nthrough the race riots without a<br />\nscratch, but before he could<br />\nmatriculate he ran smack into a<br />\nlittle problem.<br />\n\"Heroin is bad,\" he said as<br />\nstragglers checked in at my desk,<br />\n\"baaaaad.\"<br />\nHe moved to New York City,<br />\nmainly because some people in<br />\nthis area needed a liaison.<br />\n\"I can't say any names even<br />\nnow. No way.\"<br />\nNew<br />\nYork and some<br />\noverzealous suppliers gave him<br />\nthe scar, while the NYPD locked<br />\naway one of his brothers for ten<br />\nyears. Michael still couldn't<br />\nfigure out why he got off. New<br />\nYork was another nadir, but he<br />\nleft feeling that he had been<br />\ngranted a second chance.<br />\nHe came back to Baltimore<br />\nagain and married a young lady<br />\nfrom his old neighborhood. After<br />\ngathering up some courage and<br />\nsome cash, he applied to the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland. His<br />\nstudies went well, and in a few<br />\nyears he left Catonsville with a<br />\ndegree in business administration.<br />\nThere was a definite upward<br />\ntrend.<br />\n\"Do you think anyone else in<br />\nthis room has a bachelor's<br />\ndegree?\" he asked me, sweeping<br />\nan arm across the gym floor, now<br />\ncrowded with dark shapeless<br />\nforms on cots.

The drinking resulted<br />\nin less eagerness to find a position, and in the end, only<br />\nperpetuated the frustration. He<br />\ntook a course at a plumbing<br />\nschool and began to work beneath<br />\nhis education. Problems seeped<br />\ninto the home. He began to fight<br />\nwith his wife constantly,<br />\nviciously.<br />\nThen a construction company<br />\nerecting one of the numerous<br />\nbuildings downtown hired him as<br />\na laborer, and in a month made<br />\nhim a foreman.<br />\n\"I work there.

It didn't tackle me<br />\nor anything. It just jumped,\" said<br />\nfreshman Seth Hettena concerning an experience with a loose<br />\ndog on campus. \"I can see how<br />\npeople might be bothered by a<br />\ndog jumping on them. But it really didn't bother me,\" he said.<br />\nHettena's incident with the<br />\nunleashed dog typifies the experiences of other Hopkins faculty and students who have found<br />\nthemselves harrassed or even attacked by loose dogs on the<br />\nHomewood campus. An increase<br />\nin the number of' complaints<br />\nagainst unleashed dt)gs since<br />\n1983 caused Campus Security to<br />\nadopt the first ever dog policy<br />\nat Hopkins in July of 1985.<br />\nSimply put, the Homewood<br />\nDog Policy states that all dogs,<br />\nwhile on university property,<br />\n\"must be licensed, leashed, and<br />\nunder the control of their owners<br />\nat all times.\" Furthermore, dogs<br />\nare not permitted in \"common<br />\nareas of any university building\"<br />\nor allowed to \"be tied up and left<br />\nunattended anywhere on campus<br />\ngrounds.\" The policy also addresses the removal of animal excrement, citing the owners<br /><br />\nresponsible for waste deposited<br />\nby their animals.<br />\nHowever, since the adoption of<br />\nthe dog policy at Homewood in<br />\n1985, campus security has fully<br />\nenforced the law only four times,<br />\ndespite the numerous complaints<br />\nabout uncontrolled dogs, primarily on the Gilman/Upper Quad.<br />\nSecurity remains hesitant to<br />\ntake action against owners who<br />\npermit their dogs to run loose.<br />\n\"There isn't much we can do<br />\nwith loose dogs,\" said Major<br />\nRobert Larkin, chief of<br />\nHomewood security. Larkin<br />\nstressed the difficulty in investigating a complaint against a<br />\nloose dog, saying that most loose<br />\ndogs are gone once security arrives upon the scene. Larkin added. \"We're reluctant to do this<br />\n[enforce the dog policy] because<br />\ndogs are man's best friend and we<br />\nreally don't want to do<br />\nanything.\"<br />\nMany students find the dog<br />\npolicy unnecessary for various<br />\nreasons. Most freshmen, for example, enjoy seeing dogs loose on<br />\ncampus and feel that the presence<br />\nof the animals enhances the<br />\nuniversity atmosphere. \"I don't<br />\nmind dogs walking around,\" said<br />\nundergraduate Stephen Bretz.<br />\n\"You could say I communicate<br />\nwell with dogs.\" Freshman<br /><br />\nRichard Quarles agreed, saying<br />\nthat he \"loves the dogs\" and<br />\nlooks forward to seeing them<br />\naround campus.<br />\nOther students find the dog<br />\npolicy unnecessary because it is<br />\nnot consistently enforced at<br />\nHomewood. Hettena claims that<br />\nthe lax enforcement of the dog<br />\npolicy simply tells dog owners<br />\nthat security does not object to<br />\ndogs running loose. \"If you judge<br />\na law by how well it's enforced,<br />\nthen there is no leash law at<br />\nHopkins,\" said Hettena.<br />\nSophomore Jenny Levy, like<br />\nother dog owners, allows her bull<br />\nmastiff to run loose on campus<br /><br />\ngrounds only since \"no one ever<br />\nenforces it [the dog policy].\"<br />\nLarkin responded to these<br />\ncharges of insufficient enforcement by stating that Campus<br />\nSecurity indeed is not interested<br />\nin enforcing the dog policy. \"We<br />\nwant people who have.dogs to be<br />\naware of this problem,\" he said,<br />\nwe don't want to make an issue<br />\nof this policy and impound these<br />\ndogs.

The press passes that were<br />\nto be waiting for us at the door<br />\nare nowhere to be found. So<br />\nmuch for our friends at SST<br />\nRecords, I think. The bouncer<br />\ngoes off to find the club's<br />\nmanager as we wait with fingers<br />\ncrossed, hoping we won't have to<br />\npay out of our own pockets. The<br />\nmanager appears out of an alley<br />\nsomewhere, shakes my hand, and<br />\nstarts in with the standard friendly<br />\nclub manager who'd-love-to-cutus-a-deal-but-just-can't-do-it-thisti me-'cause-he's-taken-such-abeating-on-this-gig-alreadyroutine. The guy is totally wired<br />\nup on something\u2014I don't want to<br />\nknow what. He twitches and<br />\ngestures like Robin Williams'<br />\nhyperactive younger brother but<br />\nwe manage to get in at a reduced<br />\nrate; the three of us for $5.<br />\nInside, everything is cool and<br />\nuncrowded. I mean really not<br />\ncrowded. The 8x10 really matches its own description, and<br />\nwhen it's really swinging it seems<br />\nmore like the 4'x 5'. Tonight it<br />\nseems to have taken on high<br />\nschool gymnasium proportions.<br />\nThe drinks are fine, though,<br />\nand I'm almost happy to watch as<br />\nthe bartender breaks my twenty<br />\ndollar bill into increasingly<br />\nsmaller denominations. Only<br />\nfragments of it remain when the<br />\nman himself, Brian Ritchie,<br />\nwalks in the door. I barely<br />\nrecognize him from his pictures<br />\nwith the Violent Femmes. As<br />\nbassist for that group, Ritchie has<br />\nalways been the visual interest,<br />\nwith his shaved head, and robes<br /><br />\ndecorated with religious folk art.<br />\nTonight, with his own band and<br />\na new solo album of songs to<br />\nplay, he seems content to limit his<br />\n\"wild\" wardrobe to a pair of<br />\njeans festooned with hand-drawn<br />\nfaces and flowers.<br />\nSo, anyway, there he is, looking like your average joe, and I'm<br />\nstarting to get nervous. I always<br />\nget this way when I have to interview people who are slightly<br />\nfamous. I tend to forget all the<br />\nquestions I'd thought of in the cab<br />\non the way. This was no<br />\nexception.<br />\nBut then Lester, Patron Saint of<br />\nRock Critics, looked down on me<br />\nand smiled. One of Ritchie's band<br />\ncomes over to the bar where<br />\nwe're sitting and asks if we have<br />\nany cigarettes. Her name is Cynthia Bartell, or Cindy as she introduced herself. She is the only<br />\nmusician who played on the<br />\nalbum who is also part of the<br />\ntouring band. We get to talking<br />\nabout a bunch of stuff, such as:<br />\nthe current tour (it's going well,<br />\nbut it's also tiring), her previous<br />\nmusical experiences (she's a<br />\nmember of the Tetes Noires), and<br />\nthe similarity in life styles between students and musicians<br />\n(neither of us get much sleep).<br />\nThen she introduces me to Brian<br />\nwho, it seems, already knows my<br />\nname. Apparently he was supposed to put my name on the guest<br />\nlist, but, as it has already become<br />\nquite clear, that was not possible<br />\nsince I arrived first. What brutal<br />\nlogic.<br />\n\u2022 I tell him we're from Hopkins<br />\nand he tells me he remembers the<br />\nFemmes playing at the Rat, three<br />\nor four years ago. He calls it the<br />\nmost ridiculous gig he's ever<br />\nplayed. I can't help but laugh as<br /><br />\nhe describes the experience,<br />\nlikening the use of Union Sound<br />\nequipment to playing through someone's home stereo, pointing<br />\nout that nothing could possibly<br />\nsound good in a room with a<br />\ndome for a ceiling.

You gotta love him for<br />\nthat.<br />\nAnd you're gonna love this<br />\nweek's albums too, if you know<br />\nwhat's good for you. The first is<br />\nHappy Nightmare Baby, from<br />\nOpal, just the thing for all you<br />\nretro-sixties types out there. This<br />\nisn't the pretty stuff, however.<br />\nThis album is more like the Doors<br />\non the worst trip ever. Vocalist<br />\nKendra Smith sounds like a very<br />\nmellow version of Sade as she<br />\ncooly threads her way through the<br />\nmantra-like lyrics of the songs.<br />\nBehind her a freaked-out<br />\npsychedelic organ bubbles amidst<br />\nthe fuzz fest of David (Rain<br />\nParade) Roback's guitar, while<br />\nbassist William Cooper keeps a<br />\nsteady, simple beat. Together, it<br />\nall sounds very dark and<br />\nominous, and Smith's mystical<br />\noccult lyrics don't help matters<br />\nmuch. Like the Doors, Opal<br />\nkeeps things nice and simple, and<br />\nconcentrates much more on long<br />\nPhil Gochenour<br />\nViolent Femmes's bassist, Brian Richie, demonstrates his guitar prowess musical passages than a tradilast Sunday night at the 8 x 10.<br />\ntional verse/chorus kind of song.<br /><br />\nFlip Side<br /><br />\nThey are capable of going beyond<br />\nthis, however, as the title track<br />\nshows. This track still has that<br />\ncoolness, that simplicity, but it<br />\nhas almost a beatnik-jazz feel to<br />\nit. For those of you who really get<br />\ninto this, pick up a copy of Opal's<br />\nNorthern Line EP, which features<br />\ntwo songs in this \"lonesome<br />\nstranger\" vein, \"Empty Bottles,\" and the title track. My only real complaint is that I'd like<br />\nto hear more of this stuff, and a<br />\nlittle less of the psychedelia.. Ah,<br />\nbut beggars can't be choosers,<br />\nand neither can critics. For those<br />\nof you who want to catch Opal<br />\nlive, they're currently opening for<br />\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain (what<br />\ndoes that tell you?), with a slightly altered line-up, featuring Will<br />\nGlen (also of the Rain Parade) on<br />\nbass, and Keith Mitchell (Green<br />\non Red) as drummer. For those<br />\nof you who can't make the show,<br />\njust get out your favorite recreational substance, light some<br />\ncandles, and put on Happy<br />\nNightmare, Baby. I gah-run-tee<br />\nit'll be the end.<br />\nOkay, speaking of live shows,<br />\nI didn't see any of you all at the<br />\n8x 10 on Sunday night to catch<br />\nViolent Femmes bassist Brian<br />\nRitchie (and at the 8x10, it's pretty hard not to be seen). Too bad,<br />\n'cause you all missed a good<br />\nshow (eheck out Mark Stewart's<br />\nreview herein). No matter,<br />\nbecause you can hear at least part<br />\nof what you missed on his new<br />\nalbum, The Blend. And boy, will<br />\nyou be sorry.<br />\nAs might be expected from a<br />\nbass player, all of these tunes<br />\nhave a pretty tight groove, and<br />\nare sure to stick in your head for<br /><br />\nawhile. A couple of sure contenders are \"Alphabet,\" \"Doin'<br />\nthe Best We Can,\" and \"Days of<br />\nthe Blend,\" the latter being a particularly moody piece, but, tho'<br />\nit ain't happy, it sure is nice.<br />\nThose of you familiar with Ritchie and the Femmes, however,<br />\nknow that they don't always stick<br />\nto traditional pop structures. On<br />\nthis album Ritchie pulls a number<br />\nof sonically interesting rabbits out<br />\nof his hat, the best example being \"Austrian Ant Hill,\" Ritchie's sonic impression of just<br />\nthat. The recorder I can figure,<br />\nbut I'm just not sure about the<br />\nconch shells (there, that oughta<br />\npeak your interest). Ritchie draws<br />\non some real traditional forms for<br />\na couple of songs. \"John the<br />\nRevelator,\" which he describes,<br />\nas a 'gospel song,' manages to<br />\ncapture at least part of the spirit<br />\nof the gospel spiritual, while infusing it with a snappy hook and<br />\na good chunk o' funk. \"Rock of<br />\nAges\" was never like this. Finally, \"Nuclear War,\" a cover of a<br />\nsong by jazz-man Sun-Ra, will<br />\nprobably most please all the Femmes fans out there, both with it's<br />\nintensity and it's hell for leather<br />\nsound. Femmes fans will probably like this album the most,<br />\nbut for those of you who don't<br />\nmind listening to a guy taking,<br />\nsome chances, and actually pulling some of them off, you might<br />\nwanna give this a try. After all,<br />\nadventure is the spice of life.<br />\nAll right, gang, till next week,<br />\nthis is your ol' pal Snake signing<br />\noff.

Not me, I find them<br />\nextremely offensive. But then it<br />\noccurred to me that this movie<br />\nreally was a classic. When it<br />\ncame out in the early seventies,<br />\nit made an enormous impact. At<br />\nthe premiere ,at New York's<br />\nWorld Theatre were such<br />\nnotables as Johnny Carson. People were lined up to see the dirtiest movie ever made. It was<br />\nshocking, and therefore hip.<br /><br />\nDeep Throat made such an impact<br />\nthat Harry Reams (the doctor)<br />\nwas imprisoned in several states.<br />\nChristiano (Linda<br />\nLinda<br />\nLovelace) wrote her own account<br />\nof the filming of the movie,<br />\nclaiming to have been drugged<br />\nand held captive. She later went<br />\non a college lecture circuit talking about the gansterish nature of<br />\nthe pornography industry. She<br />\nbecame adamantly anti-sex and<br />\nanti-drug. So why did a movie<br />\nmade on a $25,000 budget grossmillions, and why is it still shown<br />\nat college campuses everywhere?<br />\nI. Plot Analysis: Yes, there is<br /><br />\na semblance of a plot. Linda<br />\nLovelace has unhappy sex, wants<br />\nsomething more, goes to see a<br />\n'doctor.' She finds out her<br />\nclitoris is not where it sho41 be,<br />\nbut in her throat. She says,<br />\n\"Well, I'll be damned,\" and<br />\nengages in oral sex so as to keep<br />\nthe fireworks and rockets going<br />\noff and the bells ringing. She<br />\ntakes a job as a nurse/prostitute,<br />\nand eventually decides she'll<br />\nmarry a guy who'll get himself<br />\nreduced to the perfect size. On<br />\nthe way, there are numerous explicitly documented sex scenes,<br />\nsome involving bizarre objects,<br /><br />\nAunt Dan and Lemon at Center Stage<br />\nby Amy Reiter<br />\nOur concept of theater has<br />\nchanged. Years ago, theater used to be called show business.<br />\nNowadays, it's called the entertainment industry. What's in a<br />\nname?<br />\nA<br />\nlot<br />\n(Sorry,<br />\nShakespeare). You see, both<br />\n\"business\" and \"industry\" identify the profit-making aspect of<br />\ntheater, though the latter is certainly more high-tech. The gulf of<br />\nmeaning lies between those first<br />\ntwo words,\"show\" and \"entertainment.\" Entertainment means<br />\nephemeral<br />\namusement,<br />\nsomething that takes your mind<br />\noff your troubles for two hours.<br />\nShow means something is revealed, the experience affects you in<br />\nsome way.<br />\nWallace Shawn's play Aunt<br />\nDan and Lemon at the Center<br />\nStage this month rejects the current definition of theater. No audience member leaves this show<br />\nthe same way he or she comes in.<br />\nThe play gives no answers,just<br />\na lot of questions. Our gentle interrogator is Lemon (Lily<br /><br />\nKnight), a young British woman<br />\nwho lives a very full and exciting<br />\nlife\u2014vicariously. \u2022 Speaking<br />\ndirectly to the audience, she tells<br />\nus how she doesn't like to leave<br />\nhome. Instead, she prefers to<br />\nwith<br />\nspend<br />\ntime<br />\nalone<br />\nmemories\u2014her own, those of her<br />\nAmerican Aunt Dan (Margaret<br />\nGibson), and those of people she<br />\nhas never met. With Lemon, the<br />\naudience is allowed to see a world<br />\nwhere excitement is constant and<br />\ncompassion is questionable.<br />\nUnconventionality abounds in<br />\nthis production. The lights never<br />\ndim to signal the beginning of the<br />\nplay. The audience is still talking<br />\nwhen Lemon walks on stage and<br />\nstrikes up a conversation. This<br />\nbrings the play right to us. The<br />\nrequisite barrier of darkness<br />\nwhich separates reality from fiction, audience from actor is<br />\nsuspended.<br />\nIn addition, there is no intermission. The audience is never<br />\nallowed to slip into the \"oh, this<br />\nis just a play\" mentality. From<br />\nthe moment the action begins, the<br />\naudience stays with it.

Alfred A. Knopf,<br />\n$18.95. 399 pp.<br />\nby Mary Ginder<br />\nIn the beginning, Glittering Images seems to be something entirely new for Howatch. Instead<br />\nof her typical family saga<br />\ncentered around a British family<br />\nto the manor born, Howatch gives<br />\nus a novel that spans only a few<br />\nweeks in the summer of 1937.<br />\nThe protagonist, Charles<br />\nAshworth, is an Anglican<br />\nminister and theologian, who is<br />\ndispatched by his former mentor,<br />\nthe Archbishop of Canterbury, on<br />\na bit of ecclesiastical espionage.<br />\nIt hardly sounds like the stuff<br />\nof which Howatch novels are<br />\nmade. Where are the dark<br />\nsecrets, the perversions, the<br />\nmadness, the obsessions that<br />\nhaunt the typical Howatch family? Glittering Images may be a<br />\n\"dramatic new departure\" for<br />\nHowatch, but did she manage to<br />\nbring along the well-traveled baggage of novels past. Readers of<br />\nher earlier books, especially The<br />\nWheel ofFortune, will find much<br />\nthat is familiar in this new novel.<br />\nAshworth is asked by the Archbishop to pay a short visit to the<br />\n'Bishop of Starbridge, Adam Jardine, in order to determine<br /><br />\nwhether the Bishop's unusual living arrangements could prove<br />\nscandalous to the Church. The<br />\nArchbishop is concerned that the<br />\ncharismatic Jardine is having an<br />\naffair with his wife's young companion, Lyle Christie. Jardine's<br />\nwife Carrie is pretty but nervous<br />\nand not very bright; the beautiful<br />\nand capable Lyle seems much<br />\nmore Jardine's ideal wife. The<br />\nArchbishop is not the only one to<br />\nquestion Lyle's status as spinster<br />\nin the Jardine household, particularly since Jardine already has<br />\na reputation for charm with the<br />\nladies.<br />\nEnter Charles Ashworth. Upon<br />\narriving at Starbridge, Ashworth<br />\nimmediately feels a strong attraction to Lyle. In between attempts<br />\nat seducing her, Ashworth continues his rather inept investigation of Jardine's character and<br />\nrelationship with Lyle. He now<br />\nfaces a dilemma that is both<br />\nspiritual and emotional: he wants<br />\nto believe that his beloved Lyle<br />\nis not having an affair with the<br />\nBishop and at the same time<br />\nwants to prove that the Bishop is<br />\nhaving an affair with her in order<br />\nto prove that the Bishop, like<br />\nhimself, is capable of great sin,<br />\nyet can still serve God as a<br />\nminister.<br />\nThis dilemma pushes Ashworth<br />\ninto a severe spiritual crisis.

Dr. Walker's discussion of<br />\n\"Adaptation .and Human Evolution\" was the first lecture of the<br />\nWilliam Henry Welch Lecture<br />\nSeries. Dr. Walker and his colleagues have discovered and<br />\nreconstructed the oldest known<br />\nHomo Erectus skeleton. Through<br />\ncomparisons between our closest<br />\nknown ancestor, Homo Erectus,<br />\nand ourselves, Dr. Walker explains his theories on adaptation<br />\nand the nature of evolution.<br />\nDr. Walker asserts that<br />\nalthough most evolutionary processes serve a purpose, that purpose may not be the intended one,<br />\nand the result may be the byproduct of other evolutionary<br />\nprocesses. Just by inspection of<br />\nour nearest living relative, the<br />\nchimpanzee, we can see that,<br />\nalthough our genetic material<br />\n(DNA] is 99% the same, morphologically, we are completely<br />\ndifferent. To study the changes in<br />\nevolution from Homo Erectus to<br />\nHomo Sapiens, Dr. Walker<br />\nbrings the reconstructed skeleton<br />\nas an example.<br />\nThe skeleton is that of a twelve<br />\nyear old male, found in Kenya.<br />\nIt is quite completely reconstructed, and found to be approximately 1.6 million years old. According to Dr. Walker, this fossil<br />\nshows that \"evolution proceeds<br />\nas a mosaic,\" meaning that adap-<br /><br />\ntation occurs selectively\u2014<br />\ndifferent changes occur in different times on the evolutionary<br />\nscale. For example, this model of<br />\nHomo Erectus has conflicting<br />\ncharacteristics that correspond<br />\nboth to Homo Sapiens and to<br />\nHomo Erectus' own ancestor,<br />\nRobust Australopithicenes. He is<br />\ndimorphic, meaning the morphological differences between<br />\nthe male and female of the<br />\nspecies, like Homo Sapiens, but<br />\nhis cranial capacity and shovellike teeth are similar to Robust<br />\nAustralopithicenes.<br />\nDr. Walker also expressed<br />\nother interesting features of the<br />\n\"boy fossil,\" and related them to<br />\nhis view of evolution and adaptation. He noted that the boy<br />\nwould have grown to be well over<br />\nsix feet tall. This and other<br />\nevidence leads us to believe that,<br />\non the average, our ancestors<br />\nwere taller than we are. This<br />\nmakes sense, says Dr. Walker,<br />\nbecause we are, or have been<br />\nessentially an agricultural population. Therefore, all of our food<br />\nresources depend on one thing,<br />\nwhich can be destroyed by floods<br />\nor drought. Due to this fact, we<br />\nmust be smaller to survive.<br />\nHeight is also a factor of the environment in which a population<br />\nlives. People at the equator are<br />\ngenerally taller than those at the<br />\npoles because the \"equitorial\"<br />\npeople need a large surface to<br />\nenable the body to lose more heat.<br />\nThe \"polar\" people retain heat<br />\nthrough less surface area. This is<br />\nan example of adaptation through<br />\nevolution, that is not related to a<br />\ngenetic change.<br /><br />\nThe \"giant compromise\" in<br />\nsurvival that Dr. Walker<br />\ndiscusses is best shown in the<br />\ndistance between femurs in the<br />\nleg. If the distance between the<br />\nbones is short, then the<br />\nmechanical efficiency of walking<br />\nis increased, but the pelvic area<br />\nwould be smaller. Human infants<br />\nare born with a large brain compared to other species, and<br />\ntherefore need a large birth canal.<br />\nDr. Walker asserts that the large<br />\npelvic area and decreased walking efficiency is a compromise in<br />\nadaptative evolution that allows<br />\nhumans to be born with larger<br />\nbrains.<br />\nDr. Walker ultimately elucidated his point with a picture from<br />\na recent American Express advertisement. In the ad, Willie<br />\nShoemaker, a short white jockey,<br />\nstands back to back with Wilt<br />\nChamberlain, a tall black basketball player. An outside observer<br />\nmight think that the two belong to<br />\ndifferent species, because of their<br />\nlarge differences in morphology;<br />\nhowever, of course they are both<br />\nhuman. Dr. Walker believes that<br />\nour culture is the driving force<br />\nbehind our humanism. When an<br />\ninfant is born, it has only half of<br />\nits eventual brain weight. In the<br />\nfirst year of life, the baby continues the fast fetal growth rate,<br />\nSO in effect, \"humans have a<br />\ntwenty one month gestation<br />\nperiod\u2014nine months in the womb<br />\nand twelve months outside,\"<br />\nWalker says. This is why he<br />\nbelieves that the first year of a<br />\nbaby's life is the most important<br />\nof childhood. It is in this period<br />\nof time that the child absorbs<br /><br />\nTense? Try acupuncture<br />\nby Volney Sheen<br />\nAcupuncture has often evoked<br />\nan aura of the unknown. Its<br />\nsecrets have been clouded by the<br />\nmystique of the Orient where<br />\nsome 5000 years have passed<br />\nsince the initial development of<br />\nthe methods of this hidden art.<br />\nThough acupuncture may gain little or no support from Western<br />\nmedicine and has generally been<br />\nconsidered as a therapeutic cult,<br />\nits benefits have been widespread<br />\nand successful. The transition of<br />\nacupuncture from the Far East to<br />\nthe United States has led to slight<br />\nalterations in technique. Developed by Dr. Cerney, acupressure<br />\nrelies upon the same \"pressure<br />\npoints\" used in acupuncture<br />\nwithout the actual insertion of the<br />\nneedles. Its therapeutic procedures thus have been applied by<br />\nthe novice.<br />\nAs the Hopkins student normally experiences the feeling of<br />\nfatigue and tension, perhaps a<br />\ngeneral<br />\ndiscussion<br />\nof<br />\nacupressure's solution to such a<br />\nproblem would provide a superficial understanding of this article's topic. Dr.Cerney suggests<br />\nthat one should proceed in a kind<br /><br />\n.of self-treatment which can help<br />\nin ridding the body of its \"toxic<br />\nwaste\" and set the ch'i (energy)<br />\nflowing in the meridians. One<br />\nshould first run a tension test by<br />\ninserting the right index finger into the hollow behind the right ear<br />\nlobe. Rotate. If pain exists, the individual is tense. The second test<br />\nbegins by placing the head toward<br />\none shoulder. On the exposed<br />\nside, the fingers should run firmly<br />\ndown the muscle to the base of<br />\nthe skull. Little bumps, hard and<br />\nround in texture, may be felt.<br />\nThese represent the \"knots of<br />\ntension\" and each is a \"point of<br />\nfatigue.\" This routing is then<br />\nrepeated for the opposite side of<br />\nthe neck. As these tension areas<br />\nhave been located, the fingertips<br />\ncan then acupress the knots until ,<br />\nthey disappear. A third key spot<br />\ncan be located by moving up the<br />\nbase of the skull to its insertion.<br />\nAgain a somewhat swollen and<br />\nsoft bump should be felt. By placing the third fingers of each hand<br />\non this region and gently pressing and rotating, tension should<br />\nbe alleviated.<br />\nThough the preliminary steps<br />\nmay ease tension, it is the hollow<br />\nat the base of the skull which in<br /><br />\nacupressure is the true \"vitalitygenerating\" point. Oriental charts<br />\nlabel this area as the Gv-16 or the<br />\n16th acupuncture point in the<br />\nGoverning vessel meridian. This<br />\narea lies just opposite the medulla<br />\noblongata and is believed to<br />\nstimulate the body into sustaining<br />\naction. As the medulla oblongata<br />\nis generally responsible for<br />\nrespiratory and cardiovascular<br />\nfunctions, acupressure seems to<br />\nallow a direct line of contact with<br />\nthis region of the brain. The<br />\nthumbs should be placed in this<br />\nhollow at the base of the skull and<br />\nslight pressure applied.<br />\nThough such methods in acupressure are skeptical, they do<br />\nprovide perhaps not an alternative<br />\nbut a supplement to the accepted<br />\nstandard of Western medicine.<br />\nOne should by all means consult<br />\na doctor in cases of ill health but<br />\nacupressure may again lessen the<br />\ndiscomfort to a degree or at least<br />\nprovide some psychological uplifting.

In order to gain the title,<br />\nMarean surpassed 22 runners that<br />\nhad beaten him in previous dual<br />\nmeets. Head coach James Grogan<br />\nstated, \"I expected him to catch<br />\nfour or five of those runners but<br />\nnot 22 of them.\"<br />\nThe race, at Belmont Plate&amp;<br />\nFairmount Park, consisted of<br />\nmany downhills, a feature that<br />\nMarean exploited with his long<br />\nstrides. The mild and windy<br />\nweather conditions on the day of<br />\nthe meet also contributed to his<br />\nsuccess. The critical moment during race came at the three-mile<br />\nmark when Marean passed the<br />\ntwo leaders and went on to win.<br />\nOn his performance through the<br />\nseason, Marean stated that he<br />\n\"learned to speed up in the beginning and tried to get in better<br />\nshape to avoid the burnoff three<br />\nmiles into the race.\" He began<br />\ntraining in mid-summer and has<br />\n'peaked at the right time.\"<br />\nNeither Grogan nor Marean<br /><br />\nexpected a first place finish. \"I<br />\nwas pleasantly shocked,\" noted<br />\nGrogan. \"I didn't expect him to<br />\nwin but to do well.\"<br />\nMarean added, \"I really<br />\nwasn't planning on winning it.\"<br />\nRunning without the pressure of<br />\nhaving to win helped him to relax<br />\nand perform well in his race.<br />\nWhen he eventually gained the<br />\nlead, his training to respond<br />\nunder pressure aided his effort to<br />\nmaintain his lead.<br />\nBorn in Geneseo, New York,<br />\nTim Marean grew up under conditions that would lead to his<br />\nfuture activity as a runner.<br />\nGeneseo provided a locale with<br />\nan outdoor environment conducive to running; his family supported and encouraged him. His<br />\nfather, a runner before running<br />\nbecame fashionable, influenced<br />\nMarean into running at age seven.<br />\nSerious training began at age thirteen and he ran in his first road<br />\nrace one year later.

The team improved steadily through the<br />\nseason and gained ground on<br />\nteams that they had previously<br />\nfaced this season before the<br />\nchampionship. Scott Baker and<br />\nMark Melia turned in good performances in \"beating -people<br />\nthey shouldn't have beaten.\" Eric<br />\nEspenhorst, Erik Schweitzer,<br />\nMark Melia, Dan Dairaghi, and<br />\nChris Crosby rounded out the<br />\nseven Hopkins runners. Teamwise, Haverford finished first(27<br />\npts), followed by Ursinus.(119<br />\npts) and Franklin and Marshall<br />\n(125 pts).<br />\nOn his victory, Marean felt<br /><br />\n\"astonished\" but trained greatly<br />\nto reach his goal. Marean explained that he \"set a goal of running success and kept working<br />\ntoward it.\"<br />\n\"I expected this [victory] when<br />\nI was thirteen but I had problems<br />\nwith injuries. .1 spent most of<br />\nthe time waiting to develop.

Each of the<br />\nschools can produce different<br />\nwon-lost records from their archives over the almost century of<br />\ngames, but Blue Jay historians<br />\nhave records indicating Hopkins<br />\nhas won 33 times, Western<br />\nMaryland has won 28, and four<br />\nhave been tied.<br />\nPlayers on both squads are less<br />\ninterested in history than in the<br />\ngame at Westminster Saturday.<br />\nThe season records, 3 and 6 for<br />\nHopkins and 1-7-1 for Western<br />\nMaryland, will have little meaning when the Jays meet the Terrors.

The regatta was the first head race ever<br />\nrowed by the crew, and the<br />\nrowers had never raced as far as<br />\nthe 3 /<br />\n1<br />\n2 miles the course demanded.

The boat's<br />\ncoxswain was Christy Kulich.<br />\nTwo other shells also rowed in<br />\nthe regatta and turned in respectable performances, although<br />\nboth shells suffered from limited<br />\npractice time.
