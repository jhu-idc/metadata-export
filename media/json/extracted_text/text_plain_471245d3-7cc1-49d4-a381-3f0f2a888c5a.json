He seems like the<br />\nmodel student and, in many<br />\nways, he is an idealization of the<br />\ncollege student of the sixties.<br />\nHe came to Hopkins in 1965<br />\nwith the first freshman class to<br />\nfill up the new dorm complex.<br />\nThe class, he says, was structured<br />\nwith a definite in and out crowd.<br />\nHe was, in short, \"a liberal<br />\nOptimist\", along with many of<br />\nhis classmates who were charged<br />\nwith Kennedyesque organization<br />\nand zeal.<br />\nWith this penchant for<br />\norganized change, he ran for<br />\nStudent Council. He became a<br />\nBMOC, replete with classy suits,<br />\nand a flashy car.<br />\nHe pushed for accomplishable<br />\nchange, and even now, years after<br />\nsome of his suggestions were<br />\ninstituted, like making Hutzler<br />\nopen all night, he willingly points<br />\nthem out.<br />\nBy the time he was a senior, in<br />\n1969, he said he was out of tune<br />\n<br />\nwith the incoming freshmen and<br />\nsophomores. At first he did not<br />\nunderstand the drugs and<br />\nrevolution of those classes.<br />\nBut after two years at a<br />\nHarvard grad school and a stint<br />\nheading up Boston's drug<br />\neducation program, he began to<br />\nfeel more at home with what at<br />\nfirst seemed foreign. He said he<br />\n\"learned to accept the strange as<br />\nthe commonplace.\"<br />\n<br />\nthe changes that he maintains<br />\nthey would like, Boehlke<br />\nsuggested some kind of<br />\norganizational way to implement<br />\nstudents' interaction of ideas, or<br />\nthe school might \"build and<br />\nforget as they have done before.<br />\nIn spite of this committment<br />\n<br />\nto student input, Boehlke is<br />\ndisenchanted somewhat with the<br />\npresent freshmen. He maintains<br />\nthat they are very similar to the<br />\nstudents in his own class. \"They<br />\nare virtuous, hardworking, grade<br />\nconscious, and coherent, but<br />\nthey are a little bit vacuous.\"<br />\n<br />\nStudents rate grant nominees<br />\nDave Boehlke<br />\n<br />\nSpecial highschoolers<br />\noffered admittance<br />\nUnder a new admissions policy<br />\nexceptional students will be<br />\nadmitted to Hopkins without a<br />\nhigh school diploma.<br />\nThe recently announced plan<br />\nwill accept applications through<br />\nnormal admissions channels from<br />\nable high school students seeking<br />\nentrance to Hopkins following<br />\nthier junior year.<br />\nPresident Muller cited the new<br />\npolicy as Hopkins' recognition of<br />\nthe improved preparation and<br />\ngreater maturity of high school<br />\nstudents today.<br />\nMuller explained that the<br />\nUniversity has admitted students<br />\nWithout high school diplomas in<br />\nthe past but only in special cases.<br />\n\"Now we are saying that anyone<br />\nwhose academic qualifications<br />\nare above the average of<br />\nsuccessful Johns Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates may apply and<br />\nwill be considered for the regular<br />\nprogram even if he or she has not<br />\ncompleted high school,\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\nNo Special Programs<br />\nCiting several studies which<br />\nindicate that academic<br />\nacceleration is beneficial to able<br />\nstudents, Muller stressed that the<br />\nUniversity does not intend to set<br />\nup special programs in<br />\nconnection with the change in<br />\nadmissions.<br />\nDean George Benton suggested<br />\na list of guidelines for high school<br />\nstudents considering early<br />\nadmission.

He<br />\nwants to teach, but since he is<br />\nlimited in that role by his grad<br />\nstudent enrolment, he became a<br />\nhousemaster, because \"I see it as<br />\na part of teaching never<br />\nrecognized at Hopkins.\" He uses<br />\nhis room as the dorm living<br />\nroom. He urges his charges to<br />\njoin student organizations and<br />\nfraternities. But, above all, he<br />\nurges them to get involved.<br />\nHe explained that he would<br />\nlike to see students really<br />\nthinking of ways to change the<br />\nschool. He would, for example,<br />\nlike to see students running the<br />\nHopkins Union, because he is<br />\nsure they could carry through the<br />\nfirst rate program essential to the<br />\nunion's success.<br />\nTo insure that students would<br />\nhave the chance to suggest all of<br />\n<br />\nAdmissions John Riina<br />\nemphasized the \"exceptional\"<br />\nquality sought in prospective<br />\napplicants. \"We will be open to<br />\nas many applicants as we can find<br />\nnext year and we will accept as<br />\nmany qualified high school<br />\nstudents as we can,\" Riina<br />\nremarked.<br />\nHumanities<br />\nRiina also stated that the<br />\nAdmissions Office is seeking<br />\nhighly qualified high school<br />\nstudents interested in Hopkins<br />\nIi umanities and social science<br />\ndivisions rather than an increased<br />\nnumber of pre-med applicants.<br />\nA group of exceptional high<br />\nschool students are presently<br />\nengaged in a program operated<br />\nby Dr. Julian Stanley,<br />\nPsychology, designed to help the<br />\nstudents progress through<br />\nundergraduate education more<br />\nrapidly than is normally possible.<br />\n<br />\nBy MICHAEL BERKE<br />\nChemistry Department<br />\nChairman Robert C.

Under the new plan highly qualified high<br />\nschool students will be admitted into the<br />\nundergraduate program following completion of their<br />\njunior year. It is certainly true that many exceptional<br />\nstudents are held back by being forced to complete<br />\ntheir high school requirements and have the academic<br />\ncredentials necessary to enter the University without a<br />\ndiploma. However, while Hopkins may find a large<br />\npool of academically qualified applicants, it should<br />\nrecognize that emotional maturity is a great factor<br />\ndetermining success at the undergraduate level. More<br />\noften than not, high school juniors are not equipped to<br />\nhandle the responsibilities of being an undergraduate<br />\nat Hopkins.

I<br />\nwould like to offer a few thoughts which<br />\nmay help to focus the search for a<br />\nrenaissance of the undergraduate<br />\nprogram.<br />\nIn the Middle Ages the primary role of<br />\nthe great European universities was to<br />\nacquaint its students with enough of the<br />\ncollective human experience to make an<br />\nindividual feel at home in the world, or as<br />\nMatthew Arnold put it, \"to see life<br />\nsteadily and see it whole.\" This design<br />\nwas carried on, more or less, by the best<br />\nAmerican universities until this century<br />\nwhen, because of the increasing emphasis<br />\non professional training, humanistic<br />\nstudies lost their centrality in the<br />\ncurriculum. Since World War II the need<br />\nfor specialists in all fields has become so<br />\n%teat that the tyc't,61-vaN. xeNe of the<br />\nforgotten. Dr. Muller's observation that<br />\n\"our heritage at Hopkins is that we are<br />\nsmall but superb\" is correct but only<br />\ninsofar as it applies to preparing students<br />\nfor specific careers. When the<br />\nundergraduates here complain about<br />\nbeing short-changed, I suspect that it is<br />\nlargely to this almost exclusive emphasis<br />\nof professional training that they refer,<br />\nalthough they may not be fully aware of<br />\nthe distinction. The often-heard assertion<br />\nthat Hopkins is a good place only for<br />\nthose who \"know what they want\" is a<br />\ntrenchant expression of this situation.<br />\nNow what is meant by the imposing<br />\nterm \"collective human experience?\"<br />\nSimply that the great minds and spirits of<br />\nall times were alive and mortal in the<br />\nhuman condition; that they left a record<br />\n<br />\ndepartments<br />\nAlthough their numbers are declining, Hopkins'<br />\nElectrical Engineering students now have the<br />\nopportunity to take part in one of Homewood's most<br />\ninnovative, new programs. The recently announced<br />\nrevision of the Electrical Engineering curriculum shows<br />\nthat the faculty here can offer new, popular programs<br />\nif they are only willing to make the effort.<br />\nConsolidation of the Computer Sciences program<br />\nwithin the E.E. department seems to be a logical move,<br />\nplacing computer education within easy reach of the<br />\nvery people who are likely to need it most and to be<br />\nfurthering the field in the future.<br />\nIf more departments at Homewood were willing to<br />\nprovide personal touches for their students, such as<br />\nsending letters encouraging prospective majors and<br />\nproviding easy access to faculty members, as well as<br />\nopportunities for relaxation with people of similar<br />\ninterests. Hopkins would be a more congenial place<br />\nthan it is today.<br />\nFor many students, education here is nothing more<br />\nthan four years devoted to going to classes and taking<br />\nexams, with little contact with faculty members. Few<br />\nstudents are able to gain a solid education if they are<br />\nforced to work for it without guidance. Unfortunately,<br />\nthere are departments with too many non-teaching<br />\nfaculty members who spend too much of their time<br />\ndoing research and too little time educating students,<br />\nwho are, after all, the future researchers in every field.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Vall Drive To Thull Pollin' Place.<br />\nRut Leave Timh Bti.,in Tub Us'n.\"<br />\n<br />\nIrrgrok<br />\n<br />\nBy DAVE PICKALL<br />\nDuring the years he was at Hopkins,<br />\nElia Katz had a knack for doing weird<br />\nthings that people still mention on<br />\noccasion. His writings, which appeared in<br />\nnumerous periodicals, were consistently<br />\nperceptive and forward looking. They<br />\ndealt with the simplistic absurdities that<br />\ncrowd everyday life.

He<br />\nconveys a feeling for the absurdities of<br />\nconflicting views of reality that shadow<br />\nsome of the communes, and he focuses<br />\non the extremes of idealized living<br />\nconditions.

A<br />\nfew recalled the plaque over the Lanier<br />\nRoom on the third floor, and others<br />\nremembered the statue on Charles St. But<br />\nfew outside the English Department<br />\nknew that the stamp commemorated the<br />\nbirthday, in 1842, of the Georgia poet,<br />\nmusician, and teacher, who was praised<br />\nby Tennyson and Swineburne, and who<br />\nin a short academic career, from 1879 to<br />\n1881, founded the study of literature at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe neglect of Lanier is paradoxical,<br />\nbeing both inevitable and justifiable but<br />\nnot complete. Plaques and monuments<br />\npale beside the highest tribute: a<br />\nthoroughly admirable 10-volume<br />\nCentennial Edition of his works, begun<br />\nfor the Hopkins Press in 1942 by<br />\nProfessor Emeritum Charles Anderson, a<br />\ndistant relative of Lanier's. Yet Lanier<br />\nleft Hopkins a failure, his goal to advance<br />\nfrom lecturer to professor unfulfilled. He<br />\nwent to North Carolina literally to die,<br />\nand his death from tuberculosis in<br />\nSeptember 1881 was the ineluctable fate<br />\nof lifetime of sickness. Lanier's early<br />\ndeath, relative to a life of successive<br />\nfailures, was one from which he could<br />\nnot seek a new synthesis which had<br />\npreviously sustained him.<br />\nPoetry and Music<br />\nHe is the example of a man whose<br />\nwhole life is so inextricably bound to his<br />\nwork that both aspects can only prosper<br />\ntogether or die.

I finally could not bear to<br />\nbe alone with her; our eyes on two<br />\ndifferent realities, our bodies on the same<br />\nfloor, and I was confused, felt unequal to<br />\nthe task of understanding myself in the<br />\nlight of the new demands she was making<br />\non me and was still not certain she was<br />\ncrazy, not crazy at all, or only<br />\nincredible...<br />\n\"All I want is freedom.\" She said it so<br />\ncalmly, with such a reasonable face and<br />\nvoice, just looking at us saying simply,<br />\n\"All I want is freedom,\" then looking<br />\naround in the pitifully small room with<br />\nits coughing sun dying overhead and it<br />\nseemed she was saying something that<br />\nwas the answer to every doubt we had<br />\nhad about her, as though she had thought<br />\nit too simple to bother even sayittg\u2018 it<br />\n<br />\n-re'',<br />\n<br />\nThe Great Atlantic Radio Conspiracy<br />\n(GARC) is a new weekly program on<br />\nstation WBJC-FM two of whose<br />\nconspirators, Chris Bose and Bob Zeffert,<br />\nare members of the Hopkins Social<br />\nRelations Department.

Adding still another<br />\ninterest, scholarship, in his final hectic<br />\nyears he was flutist in the Peabody<br />\nOrchestra, while simultaneously lecturing<br />\nat Peabody and Hopkins in music and<br />\nliterature. While alone, he wrote poems<br />\nwhich he hoped would cause readers \"to<br />\nsee with ears,\" affirming his belief that<br />\npoetry and music, his \"twin goddesses,\"<br />\nwere governed by identical laws.<br />\nSo Lanier made music, wrote, and<br />\nlectured. His essays on Shakespeare, the<br />\nnovel, music, poetry, and his credo in<br />\nThe Science of English Verse (1880)<br />\ndwarf his single volume of 164 poems.<br />\nUnlike Whitman, who announced his<br />\ncreative manifesto and self-assuredly<br />\nwrote to exemplify it, Lanier painfully<br />\nstruggled to vindicate his art with<br />\ntheorizing after the fact. He sincerely<br />\nbe?oeved je jad fasjopmed versewhich<br />\nwas essentially music and wanted to share<br />\nthis discovery. And his poetry often<br />\nattains musical heights of innovation<br />\nbeyond that of his American<br />\ncontemporaries or predecessors. It<br />\nremained, however, an apparent<br />\nsynthesis, meaningful only to Lanier, and<br />\nwas the ultimate frustration in<br />\ncommunicating what became a \"truth\"<br />\nlike all \"truths,\" known only to the<br />\nbeliever. His sacred \"science\" to others<br />\nwas a specious art.<br />\nIn Love<br />\nAt the end of probably his finest<br />\npoem, \"The Symphony,\" Lanier wrote:<br />\n\"Music is Love in search of a work.\" He<br />\nwas a man totally in love with his art and<br />\nlife, difficult as they were, and sought<br />\ndesperately to merge the dynamic music<br />\nof his love into verbalizations that would<br />\nleap to life as the static written word is<br />\n<br />\nsuch a look of urgency and love; but even<br />\nthough I knew of coursewhat it was all<br />\nabout, I couldn't give her freedom.

Talking<br />\nto Chris Bose, you find that while views<br />\nfrom the right like those of Buckley are<br />\nalways given media exposure, views that<br />\nchallenge basic assumptions of society are<br />\neither ignored or grossly distorted. In<br />\naddition, \"The left is never assumed to<br />\nhave a legitimate voice and only the<br />\nofficial is recorded in print. For example,<br />\nin the late 1960's, when the number of<br />\nriots was rapidly escalating the amount of<br />\ncoverage of them was actually declining.<br />\nBy cutting down the awareness of other<br />\nviewpoints, the media can serve to cut<br />\ndown the feasibility of those views. At a<br />\nminimum, this is a limit on free<br />\nexpression.\"<br />\nSo the Great Atlantic Radio<br />\nConspiracy is trying to reach people with<br />\n<br />\nthe sorts of news they wouldn't<br />\nordinarily hear. For example, did you<br />\nknow that from 1969 to 1970 draft<br />\nboards were attacked at the rate of one a<br />\nday? The Great Atlantic Radio<br />\nConspiracy picks up information like this<br />\nfrom many sources... interviews, the back<br />\npage of the New York Times, or the front<br />\npage of The Guardian. Then they put it<br />\nall together in a coherent framework. For<br />\nexample, in last week's program on<br />\nhealth, the GARC put together sections<br />\non physicians-induced diseases, drug<br />\ncompanies, the high cost of living, and<br />\nsexism and class biases in medical<br />\npractices, along with an interview with<br />\nJane Kennedy, founder of the Medical<br />\nCommittee for Human Rights. The<br />\nunderlying theme of the program was<br />\nthat medical care should be a right and<br />\nshould be equally distributed,and that<br />\ntheme was threaded from the Firesign<br />\nTheatre through statistics on the use of<br />\nhyperbaric chambers.<br />\nFuture programs will include<br />\ndiscussions of the welfare system with<br />\nJonnis Tillmon, founder of the National<br />\nWelfare Rights Organization; of<br />\nalternatives to the current medical system<br />\nwhich lie in the work of the Health<br />\nPolicy Advisory Canter, the Baltimore<br />\nFree Clinic, and a better para-professional<br />\ntraining program such as Barbara<br />\nEhrenreich (co-author of The American<br />\nHealth Empire) is developing; discussions<br />\nof food co-ops; and examples of<br />\nmovement music.

That Yale victory was the<br />\nfirst over Hopkins in five years of<br />\ncompetition, and champagne was<br />\nflowing in their locker room after<br />\nthe game.<br />\nAll but two of last year's<br />\n,arters are returning for the<br />\nBulldogs and their team sports 15<br />\nlettermen. The attack remains<br />\nintact for 1972, and it must be<br />\ncontained if the Blue Jays are to<br />\navoid another embarrassment.<br />\nLed by captain Tom Fagan,<br />\n<br />\nwhose three goals against<br />\nHopkins only partially indicated<br />\nhis instrumental role in<br />\ne\\ngineering the victory, Yale's<br />\nattack also includes senior Dan<br />\nLynch and juniors Ken Yellott<br />\nand Peter Tarr, who played<br />\nmidfield last year.<br />\nFagan, a second team<br />\nall-American selection in 1971, is<br />\none of the nation's top<br />\nattackmen, while both Lynch<br />\nand Yellott are good<br />\nstickhandlers and excellent<br />\nshooters.<br />\nBest Middies<br />\nThe Eli midfield is replete with<br />\nlettermen. Senior Jeff Pettit, at<br />\n6'3\" and 200 pounds, is one of<br />\nthe best middies from last year,<br />\nand he is joined by Don Pfeil and<br />\nBob Kelly on the first line. Other<br />\nthreats on the Bulldog squad are<br />\nDon Fizzinoglia, Mark Connell,<br />\nand Fred Danforth, all of whom<br />\n<br />\nplayed well here last year.<br />\nAs a unit the Yale offense will<br />\nbe \"the strongest we have faced<br />\nthis year,\" according to Coach<br />\nBob Scott. \"It will be a real test<br />\nfor our defense, and we will need<br />\na good defensive effort from our<br />\nmidfielders as well.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins attack will be<br />\nthreatened as Larry Story heads<br />\nthe Bulldog defense. A senior<br />\nfrom Baltimore, Story played in<br />\nhigh school for Poly and is one of<br />\nYale's best. Working with Story<br />\nare Rusty Pickett at the crease<br />\nand Van Benthuysen, who was a<br />\nreserve last season.<br />\nIn the goal again this year is<br />\nBing Gordon, who plays his<br />\nposition well and adeptly<br />\nminimizes the open angles.<br />\nThe Elis come to Homewood<br />\nwith a 1-0 record, having rallied<br />\nto beat Adelphi in the final<br />\nperiod, 9-7, in their home opener<br />\non Tuesday. Fagan netted four<br />\ngoals and Lynch scored twice,<br />\nwith single tallies coming from<br />\nTarr, Fizzinoglia, and Kelly.<br />\nProspects<br />\nPhysically one of the biggest<br />\n<br />\nHopkins'stickmen will go all out in tomorrow's opener against Yale.<br />\nteams Hopkins will play all<br />\nseason, Yale may offer an<br />\nindication of what prospects are<br />\nin store for the Blue Jays this<br />\nyear. A Hopkins victory<br />\ntomorrow would serve to add<br />\nconfidence to the young team,<br />\nand would aid the Blue Jays in<br />\ntheir attempt to gain a National<br />\nChampionship.<br />\nHopkins has improved<br />\nnoticeably with each week of<br />\n<br />\npractice, but, even with the<br />\nencouraging pre-season showings,<br />\nroom for improvement is evident.<br />\nCoach Scott notes that<br />\n\"althoughthis year we are much<br />\nbetter in stickwork, passing, and<br />\ngroundball coverage than last<br />\nyear's team was, we are still<br />\noccasionally quite sloppy. And to<br />\ndo well we'll have to cut down<br />\non the number of stupid and<br />\nunnecessary fouls.\"<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETIER<br />\n<br />\nSIX RTS<br />\nSwimmers excited about Nationals;<br />\n.<br />\npredicts finish in top five<br />\nnve<br />\nBy LAWRENCE WEINSTEIN<br />\nAccompanied by an aura of<br />\nmystery and excitement, the<br />\nJohas Hopkins Swimming team<br />\nleft for Washington and Lee<br />\nWednesday for the college<br />\ndivision national championships.<br />\nThe reason for the excitement<br />\nwas evident; the Jays have an<br />\nexcellant chance of bettering last<br />\nyear's ninth place finish at the<br />\nnationals. The reason for the<br />\nmystery is even more apparent.<br />\nOnly one man, Coach Frank<br />\nComfort, can possibly predict<br />\njust how well Hopkins will do,<br />\nand he isn't saying.<br />\nWhen asked for a prediction,<br />\nthe affable Comfort grinned and<br />\nsaid, \"No comment.\" Pressed<br />\nfurther, he hinted that Hopkins<br />\nmight finish \"somewhere in the<br />\ntop five.\"<br />\nOn Thursday, Bill Milne will<br />\nswim the 500 yard freestyle<br />\nagainst what his coach considers<br />\n\"strong competition.\" Meanwhile<br />\nfreshman swimmer Mark Horning<br />\nwill be entered in the 200 yard<br />\nindividual medly, and Tom<br />\nStenovec and sophomore Don<br />\nRemaly will also be possible<br />\nentrants.<br />\nThursday's last event will be<br />\nthe 400 yard medly relay, with<br />\nVince Nigrelli, Mark Horning, Jay<br />\nFortner and senior Kirby Weldon<br />\nbeing the likely swimmers.<br />\nFriday's first event is the 400<br />\nyard individual medley, in which<br />\nBill Milne will probably not be<br />\nswimming, though his unofficial<br />\n<br />\ntime is the field's fastest by six<br />\nseconds. Don Remaly will be<br />\nswimming in his place as will<br />\nSteve Stenovec, who had an<br />\namazing practice time in this<br />\nevent at the beginning of the<br />\nweek.<br />\nJunior Vince Nigrelli is the<br />\nteam's only entrant in the 200<br />\nyard freestyle, as is Milne in the<br />\n200 yard butterfly.<br />\nHorning and Jay Fortner will<br />\nrace in the 100 yard backstroke<br />\nevent, with Mark Horning having<br />\nan excellent chance of taking<br />\nfirst, second, or third place.<br />\nMeanwhile, Kirby Weldon is<br />\nentered in the 100 yard<br />\nbreaststroke, and any number of<br />\nBlue Jays might go in the 800<br />\nyard freestyle relay which<br />\nconcludes Friday's program.<br />\nOn Saturday, the Jays will<br />\nmake a final thrust for the top<br />\npositions. Milne will swim the<br />\n1650 yard freestyle if he wins the<br />\n500 yard race on Thursday. It<br />\nnot, he will instead compete in<br />\nthe 100 yard butterfly event<br />\nalong with Horning, with hopes<br />\nof taking first and second places.<br />\nIn that case, Tom Stenovec<br />\nwill swim the 1650 yard freestyle<br />\nrace instead, for Hopkins.<br />\nIn Saturday's other events,<br />\nNigrelli will enter the 100 yard<br />\nfreestyle, Fortner the 200 yard<br />\nbackstroke, and Weldon and<br />\nfreshman Andre Poe, the 200<br />\nyard breaststroke. Hopkins Will<br />\nnot contest the 3 meter dive.<br />\nThe meet's last event, the 400<br />\n<br />\nyard freestyle relay, may well be<br />\ncrucial for Hopkins in their<br />\nattempt to nab at least fourth,<br />\nplace In any event Comfort will<br />\nprobably pick Milne, Stenovec,<br />\nNigrelli, and Jim Finnerty to<br />\nswim in this event.<br />\n<br />\nLate<br />\nnews<br />\nAfter Thursday night's<br />\ncompetition, Hopkins is<br />\ncurrently in a tie for sixth place,<br />\nalong with Northern Michigan<br />\nIniversity. The University of<br />\nCali forma at Irvine and the<br />\nUniversity of South Florida head<br />\nthe list of entrants at this time.<br />\nSo far, Hopkins has entered in<br />\nthree events, the 500 yard<br />\nfreestyle ( in which Bill Milne<br />\nplaced second behind Tom<br />\nBoughey of UC1 with a time of<br />\n4:50.1), the 200 yard individual<br />\nmedley (which featured a twelfth<br />\nplace finish by freshman Mark<br />\nHorning, with Rick Morehead of<br />\nSouth Florida taking first) and<br />\nthe 400 yard medley relay (with<br />\nthe team of Fortner, Kirby<br />\nWeldon, Mark Horning and Vince<br />\nNigrelli taking fourth place with<br />\na time of 3:41.51).<br />\nThe only other note of interest<br />\nfor Hopkins fans concerns Bill<br />\nMilne's performance in the 500<br />\n<br />\nKirby Weldon, Hopkins'swimmer, and his rabbit's foot.<br />\nyard freestyle trial events held<br />\nearlier Thursday, in which Milne<br />\nestablished a new Hopkins record<br />\n<br />\nwith a time of 4:47.02, which<br />\nincidently would have been good<br />\nenough to win the actual event.<br />\n<br />\nLacrosse schedule<br />\nLACROSSE<br />\nSat., Mar, 18<br />\nSat., Mar 25<br />\nSat.

GOLDSEKER LAW SUIT<br />\nThe most important issue underlying the fact that the case against us in the Federal Court was dismissed several days ago is<br />\nwhether or not we overcharged our customers.<br />\nBefore the lawsuit was instituted against us, we publicly offered any sincere person or group the opportunity to examine our<br />\nbooks and records to see what profit we made. Prior to trial we volunteered to allow the plaintiffs to choose a Certified Public<br />\nAccountant of their liking to come into our office and examine our books and records. They did, and their auditors carefully<br />\nexamined our accounting books, our records, cancelled checks, contracts and numerous- other documents, and after so doing<br />\ndiscovered within percentage points that the expenses and profit we have been quoting for several years were true. Therefore,<br />\nthe conclusion had to be drawn that the M. Goldseker Company did not overcharge. Certainly no one in our position could have<br />\ndone any more than we dicl in subjecting ourselves to a revealing examination of this kind, and the results speak for themselves.<br />\nBy the time the trial began, a great number of the allegations in the complaint filed against our company had fallen by the<br />\nwayside. Thirty-five of the original seventy-six individual plaintiffs had dropped out of the case. At the conclusion of their<br />\nevidence, the plaintiffs even admitted they had not made out a case against us.<br />\n<br />\nWE SUBMIT<br />\n<br />\nthat the plaintiffs after two years of litigation were unable to make out a case against us.<br />\n<br />\nWE SUBMIT<br />\n<br />\nthat the plaintiffs did hire an appraiser and the appraiser did make appraisals for them. Why was<br />\n<br />\nthe appraiser withdrawn? Why was a new appraiser necessary?<br />\n<br />\nWE SUBMIT<br />\n<br />\nthat the reason the appraiser was withdrawn was because he was unable to prove we overcharged.<br />\n<br />\nWE SUBMIT<br />\n<br />\nthat if the plaintiffs believed they had a case against us and that a new appraiser was needed,<br />\nresponsible blacks and other people and groups interested in black housing in the community could have been called upon and<br />\ncertainly they would have supplied either the talent or the few hundred dollars necessary to employ another appraiser.<br />\n<br />\nThe persons who sued us, however, withdrew their case and the Court dismissed the complaint against us for lack of<br />\nevidence. Our sympathy lies with our few customers who were led to believe they were taken advantage of. We feel no ill will<br />\ntowards them. Had those Activists who misled our customers seen fit to accept our offer to examine our books and records in<br />\nthe first place, they would have discovered the truth. They were offered the same opportunity as the Plaintiffs were to choose a<br />\nCertified Public Accountant to examine our record/. Once the Activists discovered we did not overcharge anyone, they would<br />\nhave found it necessary to go fram door to door and neighborhood to neighborhood in order to spread unfounded and unjust<br />\npropoganda to the public, and most importantly they could have prevented the community from being incited unnecessarily<br />\nagainst us and against all those who were engaged in legitimate business enterprises.<br />\n<br />\nThe M.

He seems like the<br />\nmodel student and, in many<br />\nways, he is an idealization of the<br />\ncollege student of the sixties.<br />\nHe came to Hopkins in 1965<br />\nwith the first freshman class to<br />\nfill up the new dorm complex.<br />\nThe class, he says, was structured<br />\nwith a definite in and out crowd.<br />\nHe was, in short, \"a liberal<br />\nOptimist\", along with many of<br />\nhis classmates who were charged<br />\nwith Kennedyesque organization<br />\nand zeal.<br />\nWith this penchant for<br />\norganized change, he ran for<br />\nStudent Council. He became a<br />\nBMOC, replete with classy suits,<br />\nand a flashy car.<br />\nHe pushed for accomplishable<br />\nchange, and even now, years after<br />\nsome of his suggestions were<br />\ninstituted, like making Hutzler<br />\nopen all night, he willingly points<br />\nthem out.<br />\nBy the time he was a senior, in<br />\n1969, he said he was out of tune<br /><br />\nwith the incoming freshmen and<br />\nsophomores. At first he did not<br />\nunderstand the drugs and<br />\nrevolution of those classes.<br />\nBut after two years at a<br />\nHarvard grad school and a stint<br />\nheading up Boston's drug<br />\neducation program, he began to<br />\nfeel more at home with what at<br />\nfirst seemed foreign. He said he<br />\n\"learned to accept the strange as<br />\nthe commonplace.\"<br /><br />\nthe changes that he maintains<br />\nthey would like, Boehlke<br />\nsuggested some kind of<br />\norganizational way to implement<br />\nstudents' interaction of ideas, or<br />\nthe school might \"build and<br />\nforget as they have done before.<br />\nIn spite of this committment<br /><br />\nto student input, Boehlke is<br />\ndisenchanted somewhat with the<br />\npresent freshmen.

He<br />\nwants to teach, but since he is<br />\nlimited in that role by his grad<br />\nstudent enrolment, he became a<br />\nhousemaster, because \"I see it as<br />\na part of teaching never<br />\nrecognized at Hopkins.\" He uses<br />\nhis room as the dorm living<br />\nroom. He urges his charges to<br />\njoin student organizations and<br />\nfraternities. But, above all, he<br />\nurges them to get involved.<br />\nHe explained that he would<br />\nlike to see students really<br />\nthinking of ways to change the<br />\nschool.

Under the new plan highly qualified high<br />\nschool students will be admitted into the<br />\nundergraduate program following completion of their<br />\njunior year. It is certainly true that many exceptional<br />\nstudents are held back by being forced to complete<br />\ntheir high school requirements and have the academic<br />\ncredentials necessary to enter the University without a<br />\ndiploma. However, while Hopkins may find a large<br />\npool of academically qualified applicants, it should<br />\nrecognize that emotional maturity is a great factor<br />\ndetermining success at the undergraduate level. More<br />\noften than not, high school juniors are not equipped to<br />\nhandle the responsibilities of being an undergraduate<br />\nat Hopkins.

I<br />\nwould like to offer a few thoughts which<br />\nmay help to focus the search for a<br />\nrenaissance of the undergraduate<br />\nprogram.<br />\nIn the Middle Ages the primary role of<br />\nthe great European universities was to<br />\nacquaint its students with enough of the<br />\ncollective human experience to make an<br />\nindividual feel at home in the world, or as<br />\nMatthew Arnold put it, \"to see life<br />\nsteadily and see it whole.\" This design<br />\nwas carried on, more or less, by the best<br />\nAmerican universities until this century<br />\nwhen, because of the increasing emphasis<br />\non professional training, humanistic<br />\nstudies lost their centrality in the<br />\ncurriculum. Since World War II the need<br />\nfor specialists in all fields has become so<br />\n%teat that the tyc't,61-vaN. xeNe of the<br />\nforgotten. Dr. Muller's observation that<br />\n\"our heritage at Hopkins is that we are<br />\nsmall but superb\" is correct but only<br />\ninsofar as it applies to preparing students<br />\nfor specific careers. When the<br />\nundergraduates here complain about<br />\nbeing short-changed, I suspect that it is<br />\nlargely to this almost exclusive emphasis<br />\nof professional training that they refer,<br />\nalthough they may not be fully aware of<br />\nthe distinction. The often-heard assertion<br />\nthat Hopkins is a good place only for<br />\nthose who \"know what they want\" is a<br />\ntrenchant expression of this situation.<br />\nNow what is meant by the imposing<br />\nterm \"collective human experience?\"<br />\nSimply that the great minds and spirits of<br />\nall times were alive and mortal in the<br />\nhuman condition; that they left a record<br /><br />\ndepartments<br />\nAlthough their numbers are declining, Hopkins'<br />\nElectrical Engineering students now have the<br />\nopportunity to take part in one of Homewood's most<br />\ninnovative, new programs. The recently announced<br />\nrevision of the Electrical Engineering curriculum shows<br />\nthat the faculty here can offer new, popular programs<br />\nif they are only willing to make the effort.<br />\nConsolidation of the Computer Sciences program<br />\nwithin the E.E. department seems to be a logical move,<br />\nplacing computer education within easy reach of the<br />\nvery people who are likely to need it most and to be<br />\nfurthering the field in the future.<br />\nIf more departments at Homewood were willing to<br />\nprovide personal touches for their students, such as<br />\nsending letters encouraging prospective majors and<br />\nproviding easy access to faculty members, as well as<br />\nopportunities for relaxation with people of similar<br />\ninterests. Hopkins would be a more congenial place<br />\nthan it is today.<br />\nFor many students, education here is nothing more<br />\nthan four years devoted to going to classes and taking<br />\nexams, with little contact with faculty members. Few<br />\nstudents are able to gain a solid education if they are<br />\nforced to work for it without guidance. Unfortunately,<br />\nthere are departments with too many non-teaching<br />\nfaculty members who spend too much of their time<br />\ndoing research and too little time educating students,<br />\nwho are, after all, the future researchers in every field.<br /><br />\n\u2022Vall Drive To Thull Pollin' Place.<br />\nRut Leave Timh Bti.,in Tub Us'n.\"<br /><br />\nIrrgrok<br /><br />\nBy DAVE PICKALL<br />\nDuring the years he was at Hopkins,<br />\nElia Katz had a knack for doing weird<br />\nthings that people still mention on<br />\noccasion. His writings, which appeared in<br />\nnumerous periodicals, were consistently<br />\nperceptive and forward looking. They<br />\ndealt with the simplistic absurdities that<br />\ncrowd everyday life.

He<br />\nconveys a feeling for the absurdities of<br />\nconflicting views of reality that shadow<br />\nsome of the communes, and he focuses<br />\non the extremes of idealized living<br />\nconditions.

A<br />\nfew recalled the plaque over the Lanier<br />\nRoom on the third floor, and others<br />\nremembered the statue on Charles St. But<br />\nfew outside the English Department<br />\nknew that the stamp commemorated the<br />\nbirthday, in 1842, of the Georgia poet,<br />\nmusician, and teacher, who was praised<br />\nby Tennyson and Swineburne, and who<br />\nin a short academic career, from 1879 to<br />\n1881, founded the study of literature at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe neglect of Lanier is paradoxical,<br />\nbeing both inevitable and justifiable but<br />\nnot complete. Plaques and monuments<br />\npale beside the highest tribute: a<br />\nthoroughly admirable 10-volume<br />\nCentennial Edition of his works, begun<br />\nfor the Hopkins Press in 1942 by<br />\nProfessor Emeritum Charles Anderson, a<br />\ndistant relative of Lanier's. Yet Lanier<br />\nleft Hopkins a failure, his goal to advance<br />\nfrom lecturer to professor unfulfilled. He<br />\nwent to North Carolina literally to die,<br />\nand his death from tuberculosis in<br />\nSeptember 1881 was the ineluctable fate<br />\nof lifetime of sickness. Lanier's early<br />\ndeath, relative to a life of successive<br />\nfailures, was one from which he could<br />\nnot seek a new synthesis which had<br />\npreviously sustained him.<br />\nPoetry and Music<br />\nHe is the example of a man whose<br />\nwhole life is so inextricably bound to his<br />\nwork that both aspects can only prosper<br />\ntogether or die.

I finally could not bear to<br />\nbe alone with her; our eyes on two<br />\ndifferent realities, our bodies on the same<br />\nfloor, and I was confused, felt unequal to<br />\nthe task of understanding myself in the<br />\nlight of the new demands she was making<br />\non me and was still not certain she was<br />\ncrazy, not crazy at all, or only<br />\nincredible...<br />\n\"All I want is freedom.\" She said it so<br />\ncalmly, with such a reasonable face and<br />\nvoice, just looking at us saying simply,<br />\n\"All I want is freedom,\" then looking<br />\naround in the pitifully small room with<br />\nits coughing sun dying overhead and it<br />\nseemed she was saying something that<br />\nwas the answer to every doubt we had<br />\nhad about her, as though she had thought<br />\nit too simple to bother even sayittg\u2018 it<br /><br />\n-re'',<br /><br />\nThe Great Atlantic Radio Conspiracy<br />\n(GARC) is a new weekly program on<br />\nstation WBJC-FM two of whose<br />\nconspirators, Chris Bose and Bob Zeffert,<br />\nare members of the Hopkins Social<br />\nRelations Department.

Adding still another<br />\ninterest, scholarship, in his final hectic<br />\nyears he was flutist in the Peabody<br />\nOrchestra, while simultaneously lecturing<br />\nat Peabody and Hopkins in music and<br />\nliterature. While alone, he wrote poems<br />\nwhich he hoped would cause readers \"to<br />\nsee with ears,\" affirming his belief that<br />\npoetry and music, his \"twin goddesses,\"<br />\nwere governed by identical laws.<br />\nSo Lanier made music, wrote, and<br />\nlectured. His essays on Shakespeare, the<br />\nnovel, music, poetry, and his credo in<br />\nThe Science of English Verse (1880)<br />\ndwarf his single volume of 164 poems.<br />\nUnlike Whitman, who announced his<br />\ncreative manifesto and self-assuredly<br />\nwrote to exemplify it, Lanier painfully<br />\nstruggled to vindicate his art with<br />\ntheorizing after the fact. He sincerely<br />\nbe?oeved je jad fasjopmed versewhich<br />\nwas essentially music and wanted to share<br />\nthis discovery. And his poetry often<br />\nattains musical heights of innovation<br />\nbeyond that of his American<br />\ncontemporaries or predecessors. It<br />\nremained, however, an apparent<br />\nsynthesis, meaningful only to Lanier, and<br />\nwas the ultimate frustration in<br />\ncommunicating what became a \"truth\"<br />\nlike all \"truths,\" known only to the<br />\nbeliever. His sacred \"science\" to others<br />\nwas a specious art.<br />\nIn Love<br />\nAt the end of probably his finest<br />\npoem, \"The Symphony,\" Lanier wrote:<br />\n\"Music is Love in search of a work.\" He<br />\nwas a man totally in love with his art and<br />\nlife, difficult as they were, and sought<br />\ndesperately to merge the dynamic music<br />\nof his love into verbalizations that would<br />\nleap to life as the static written word is<br /><br />\nsuch a look of urgency and love; but even<br />\nthough I knew of coursewhat it was all<br />\nabout, I couldn't give her freedom.

In<br />\naddition, \"The left is never assumed to<br />\nhave a legitimate voice and only the<br />\nofficial is recorded in print. For example,<br />\nin the late 1960's, when the number of<br />\nriots was rapidly escalating the amount of<br />\ncoverage of them was actually declining.<br />\nBy cutting down the awareness of other<br />\nviewpoints, the media can serve to cut<br />\ndown the feasibility of those views. At a<br />\nminimum, this is a limit on free<br />\nexpression.\"<br />\nSo the Great Atlantic Radio<br />\nConspiracy is trying to reach people with<br /><br />\nthe sorts of news they wouldn't<br />\nordinarily hear. For example, did you<br />\nknow that from 1969 to 1970 draft<br />\nboards were attacked at the rate of one a<br />\nday? The Great Atlantic Radio<br />\nConspiracy picks up information like this<br />\nfrom many sources... interviews, the back<br />\npage of the New York Times, or the front<br />\npage of The Guardian. Then they put it<br />\nall together in a coherent framework. For<br />\nexample, in last week's program on<br />\nhealth, the GARC put together sections<br />\non physicians-induced diseases, drug<br />\ncompanies, the high cost of living, and<br />\nsexism and class biases in medical<br />\npractices, along with an interview with<br />\nJane Kennedy, founder of the Medical<br />\nCommittee for Human Rights. The<br />\nunderlying theme of the program was<br />\nthat medical care should be a right and<br />\nshould be equally distributed,and that<br />\ntheme was threaded from the Firesign<br />\nTheatre through statistics on the use of<br />\nhyperbaric chambers.<br />\nFuture programs will include<br />\ndiscussions of the welfare system with<br />\nJonnis Tillmon, founder of the National<br />\nWelfare Rights Organization; of<br />\nalternatives to the current medical system<br />\nwhich lie in the work of the Health<br />\nPolicy Advisory Canter, the Baltimore<br />\nFree Clinic, and a better para-professional<br />\ntraining program such as Barbara<br />\nEhrenreich (co-author of The American<br />\nHealth Empire) is developing; discussions<br />\nof food co-ops; and examples of<br />\nmovement music.

That Yale victory was the<br />\nfirst over Hopkins in five years of<br />\ncompetition, and champagne was<br />\nflowing in their locker room after<br />\nthe game.<br />\nAll but two of last year's<br />\n,arters are returning for the<br />\nBulldogs and their team sports 15<br />\nlettermen. The attack remains<br />\nintact for 1972, and it must be<br />\ncontained if the Blue Jays are to<br />\navoid another embarrassment.<br />\nLed by captain Tom Fagan,<br /><br />\nwhose three goals against<br />\nHopkins only partially indicated<br />\nhis instrumental role in<br />\ne\\ngineering the victory, Yale's<br />\nattack also includes senior Dan<br />\nLynch and juniors Ken Yellott<br />\nand Peter Tarr, who played<br />\nmidfield last year.<br />\nFagan, a second team<br />\nall-American selection in 1971, is<br />\none of the nation's top<br />\nattackmen, while both Lynch<br />\nand Yellott are good<br />\nstickhandlers and excellent<br />\nshooters.<br />\nBest Middies<br />\nThe Eli midfield is replete with<br />\nlettermen. Senior Jeff Pettit, at<br />\n6'3\" and 200 pounds, is one of<br />\nthe best middies from last year,<br />\nand he is joined by Don Pfeil and<br />\nBob Kelly on the first line. Other<br />\nthreats on the Bulldog squad are<br />\nDon Fizzinoglia, Mark Connell,<br />\nand Fred Danforth, all of whom<br /><br />\nplayed well here last year.<br />\nAs a unit the Yale offense will<br />\nbe \"the strongest we have faced<br />\nthis year,\" according to Coach<br />\nBob Scott. \"It will be a real test<br />\nfor our defense, and we will need<br />\na good defensive effort from our<br />\nmidfielders as well.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins attack will be<br />\nthreatened as Larry Story heads<br />\nthe Bulldog defense. A senior<br />\nfrom Baltimore, Story played in<br />\nhigh school for Poly and is one of<br />\nYale's best. Working with Story<br />\nare Rusty Pickett at the crease<br />\nand Van Benthuysen, who was a<br />\nreserve last season.<br />\nIn the goal again this year is<br />\nBing Gordon, who plays his<br />\nposition well and adeptly<br />\nminimizes the open angles.<br />\nThe Elis come to Homewood<br />\nwith a 1-0 record, having rallied<br />\nto beat Adelphi in the final<br />\nperiod, 9-7, in their home opener<br />\non Tuesday. Fagan netted four<br />\ngoals and Lynch scored twice,<br />\nwith single tallies coming from<br />\nTarr, Fizzinoglia, and Kelly.<br />\nProspects<br />\nPhysically one of the biggest<br /><br />\nHopkins'stickmen will go all out in tomorrow's opener against Yale.<br />\nteams Hopkins will play all<br />\nseason, Yale may offer an<br />\nindication of what prospects are<br />\nin store for the Blue Jays this<br />\nyear. A Hopkins victory<br />\ntomorrow would serve to add<br />\nconfidence to the young team,<br />\nand would aid the Blue Jays in<br />\ntheir attempt to gain a National<br />\nChampionship.<br />\nHopkins has improved<br />\nnoticeably with each week of<br /><br />\npractice, but, even with the<br />\nencouraging pre-season showings,<br />\nroom for improvement is evident.<br />\nCoach Scott notes that<br />\n\"althoughthis year we are much<br />\nbetter in stickwork, passing, and<br />\ngroundball coverage than last<br />\nyear's team was, we are still<br />\noccasionally quite sloppy. And to<br />\ndo well we'll have to cut down<br />\non the number of stupid and<br />\nunnecessary fouls.\"<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETIER<br /><br />\nSIX RTS<br />\nSwimmers excited about Nationals;<br />\n.<br />\npredicts finish in top five<br />\nnve<br />\nBy LAWRENCE WEINSTEIN<br />\nAccompanied by an aura of<br />\nmystery and excitement, the<br />\nJohas Hopkins Swimming team<br />\nleft for Washington and Lee<br />\nWednesday for the college<br />\ndivision national championships.<br />\nThe reason for the excitement<br />\nwas evident; the Jays have an<br />\nexcellant chance of bettering last<br />\nyear's ninth place finish at the<br />\nnationals. The reason for the<br />\nmystery is even more apparent.<br />\nOnly one man, Coach Frank<br />\nComfort, can possibly predict<br />\njust how well Hopkins will do,<br />\nand he isn't saying.<br />\nWhen asked for a prediction,<br />\nthe affable Comfort grinned and<br />\nsaid, \"No comment.\" Pressed<br />\nfurther, he hinted that Hopkins<br />\nmight finish \"somewhere in the<br />\ntop five.\"<br />\nOn Thursday, Bill Milne will<br />\nswim the 500 yard freestyle<br />\nagainst what his coach considers<br />\n\"strong competition.\" Meanwhile<br />\nfreshman swimmer Mark Horning<br />\nwill be entered in the 200 yard<br />\nindividual medly, and Tom<br />\nStenovec and sophomore Don<br />\nRemaly will also be possible<br />\nentrants.<br />\nThursday's last event will be<br />\nthe 400 yard medly relay, with<br />\nVince Nigrelli, Mark Horning, Jay<br />\nFortner and senior Kirby Weldon<br />\nbeing the likely swimmers.<br />\nFriday's first event is the 400<br />\nyard individual medley, in which<br />\nBill Milne will probably not be<br />\nswimming, though his unofficial<br /><br />\ntime is the field's fastest by six<br />\nseconds. Don Remaly will be<br />\nswimming in his place as will<br />\nSteve Stenovec, who had an<br />\namazing practice time in this<br />\nevent at the beginning of the<br />\nweek.<br />\nJunior Vince Nigrelli is the<br />\nteam's only entrant in the 200<br />\nyard freestyle, as is Milne in the<br />\n200 yard butterfly.<br />\nHorning and Jay Fortner will<br />\nrace in the 100 yard backstroke<br />\nevent, with Mark Horning having<br />\nan excellent chance of taking<br />\nfirst, second, or third place.<br />\nMeanwhile, Kirby Weldon is<br />\nentered in the 100 yard<br />\nbreaststroke, and any number of<br />\nBlue Jays might go in the 800<br />\nyard freestyle relay which<br />\nconcludes Friday's program.<br />\nOn Saturday, the Jays will<br />\nmake a final thrust for the top<br />\npositions. Milne will swim the<br />\n1650 yard freestyle if he wins the<br />\n500 yard race on Thursday. It<br />\nnot, he will instead compete in<br />\nthe 100 yard butterfly event<br />\nalong with Horning, with hopes<br />\nof taking first and second places.<br />\nIn that case, Tom Stenovec<br />\nwill swim the 1650 yard freestyle<br />\nrace instead, for Hopkins.<br />\nIn Saturday's other events,<br />\nNigrelli will enter the 100 yard<br />\nfreestyle, Fortner the 200 yard<br />\nbackstroke, and Weldon and<br />\nfreshman Andre Poe, the 200<br />\nyard breaststroke. Hopkins Will<br />\nnot contest the 3 meter dive.<br />\nThe meet's last event, the 400<br /><br />\nyard freestyle relay, may well be<br />\ncrucial for Hopkins in their<br />\nattempt to nab at least fourth,<br />\nplace In any event Comfort will<br />\nprobably pick Milne, Stenovec,<br />\nNigrelli, and Jim Finnerty to<br />\nswim in this event.<br /><br />\nLate<br />\nnews<br />\nAfter Thursday night's<br />\ncompetition, Hopkins is<br />\ncurrently in a tie for sixth place,<br />\nalong with Northern Michigan<br />\nIniversity. The University of<br />\nCali forma at Irvine and the<br />\nUniversity of South Florida head<br />\nthe list of entrants at this time.<br />\nSo far, Hopkins has entered in<br />\nthree events, the 500 yard<br />\nfreestyle ( in which Bill Milne<br />\nplaced second behind Tom<br />\nBoughey of UC1 with a time of<br />\n4:50.1), the 200 yard individual<br />\nmedley (which featured a twelfth<br />\nplace finish by freshman Mark<br />\nHorning, with Rick Morehead of<br />\nSouth Florida taking first) and<br />\nthe 400 yard medley relay (with<br />\nthe team of Fortner, Kirby<br />\nWeldon, Mark Horning and Vince<br />\nNigrelli taking fourth place with<br />\na time of 3:41.51).<br />\nThe only other note of interest<br />\nfor Hopkins fans concerns Bill<br />\nMilne's performance in the 500<br /><br />\nKirby Weldon, Hopkins'swimmer, and his rabbit's foot.<br />\nyard freestyle trial events held<br />\nearlier Thursday, in which Milne<br />\nestablished a new Hopkins record<br /><br />\nwith a time of 4:47.02, which<br />\nincidently would have been good<br />\nenough to win the actual event.<br /><br />\nLacrosse schedule<br />\nLACROSSE<br />\nSat., Mar, 18<br />\nSat., Mar 25<br />\nSat.

GOLDSEKER LAW SUIT<br />\nThe most important issue underlying the fact that the case against us in the Federal Court was dismissed several days ago is<br />\nwhether or not we overcharged our customers.<br />\nBefore the lawsuit was instituted against us, we publicly offered any sincere person or group the opportunity to examine our<br />\nbooks and records to see what profit we made. Prior to trial we volunteered to allow the plaintiffs to choose a Certified Public<br />\nAccountant of their liking to come into our office and examine our books and records. They did, and their auditors carefully<br />\nexamined our accounting books, our records, cancelled checks, contracts and numerous- other documents, and after so doing<br />\ndiscovered within percentage points that the expenses and profit we have been quoting for several years were true. Therefore,<br />\nthe conclusion had to be drawn that the M. Goldseker Company did not overcharge. Certainly no one in our position could have<br />\ndone any more than we dicl in subjecting ourselves to a revealing examination of this kind, and the results speak for themselves.<br />\nBy the time the trial began, a great number of the allegations in the complaint filed against our company had fallen by the<br />\nwayside. Thirty-five of the original seventy-six individual plaintiffs had dropped out of the case. At the conclusion of their<br />\nevidence, the plaintiffs even admitted they had not made out a case against us.<br /><br />\nWE SUBMIT<br /><br />\nthat the plaintiffs after two years of litigation were unable to make out a case against us.<br /><br />\nWE SUBMIT<br /><br />\nthat the plaintiffs did hire an appraiser and the appraiser did make appraisals for them. Why was<br /><br />\nthe appraiser withdrawn? Why was a new appraiser necessary?<br /><br />\nWE SUBMIT<br /><br />\nthat the reason the appraiser was withdrawn was because he was unable to prove we overcharged.<br /><br />\nWE SUBMIT<br /><br />\nthat if the plaintiffs believed they had a case against us and that a new appraiser was needed,<br />\nresponsible blacks and other people and groups interested in black housing in the community could have been called upon and<br />\ncertainly they would have supplied either the talent or the few hundred dollars necessary to employ another appraiser.<br /><br />\nThe persons who sued us, however, withdrew their case and the Court dismissed the complaint against us for lack of<br />\nevidence. Our sympathy lies with our few customers who were led to believe they were taken advantage of. We feel no ill will<br />\ntowards them. Had those Activists who misled our customers seen fit to accept our offer to examine our books and records in<br />\nthe first place, they would have discovered the truth. They were offered the same opportunity as the Plaintiffs were to choose a<br />\nCertified Public Accountant to examine our record/. Once the Activists discovered we did not overcharge anyone, they would<br />\nhave found it necessary to go fram door to door and neighborhood to neighborhood in order to spread unfounded and unjust<br />\npropoganda to the public, and most importantly they could have prevented the community from being incited unnecessarily<br />\nagainst us and against all those who were engaged in legitimate business enterprises.<br /><br />\nThe M.
