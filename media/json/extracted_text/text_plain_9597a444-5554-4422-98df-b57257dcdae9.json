The condition of the<br />\ngrounds made the playing ludicrous<br />\nat times, when two men came together in body-checking or when<br />\none tried to dodge the other. Falls<br />\nin the mud and water amused<br />\nthe small crowd of spectators at<br />\nevery point of the game.<br />\nThe closeness of the score is due<br />\nto Harvard's brace in the second<br />\nhalf. In the first half Hopkins<br />\nshowed good teamwork, and played<br />\nmost of the time in the Crimson<br />\nterritory. At the end of the half<br />\nthe score stood 3-1 in Hopkins'<br />\nfavor. Harvard scored first, after<br />\nfour and a half minutes' play, when<br />\nForistall passed to Blackett, who<br />\nshot the goal.

Paulus<br />\nsecured the ball in Hopkins' territory, passed to Gail, Gail to Easter,<br />\nwho scored the first Hopkins tally.<br />\nIn thirty seconds Gail shot the<br />\nsecond goal, after a relay from<br />\nEverton. Within three more minutes Gail scored a second time, after<br />\nsome clever dodging by Paulus,<br />\nwho passed him the ball.<br />\nAt this point Harvard braced up<br />\nand prevented further scoring. In<br />\nthe second half, however, three<br />\ngoals were credited to the visitors,<br />\nand only two to Hopkins. Harvard's defence tightened and her<br />\nattack played a more concerted<br />\ngame. Her inaccuracy in shooting<br />\nfor the net cost a number of goals<br />\nwhich, perhaps, would have won<br />\nthe game for the Crimson.

For<br />\neleven years he has directed the<br />\ndestinies of the University\u2014a period marked by steady growth,<br />\nconstant progress, and wise preparation for the expansion yet to<br />\ncome. During that time two great<br />\nendowment funds have been raised.<br />\nDuring that time the Homewood<br />\nidea has been conceived and safely<br />\nbrought to the very eve of realization. And now the leader who has<br />\nguided us through these years of<br />\ntoil and unrewarded hope, halts<br />\nupon the borders of the promised<br />\nland and resigns his trust to other<br />\nhands. President Remsen's selfsacrifice is worthy of the highest<br />\nadmiration. To another will belong the honor of installing the University at Homewood; to another<br />\nwill belong the glory of presiding<br />\nover it in the years of prosperity,<br />\nwhen fitly housed and fitly equipped<br />\nit will take its place at the head<br />\nof the universities \u2022of America; but<br />\nlet us not forget that these things<br />\nwould never have been possible but<br />\nfor the quiet effort and provident<br />\nsagacity of the man who is now<br />\nlaying down his leadership.<br />\n\"<br />\n<br />\nThe New Athletic Policies.<br />\n<br />\nIt will be remembered that in<br />\nthe last issue of THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwe devoted a good deal of space<br />\nand attention to the new athletic<br />\npolicies and our views on the subject. It is not necessary to rehash<br />\nthem again. But since that time<br />\nwe have heard so many students<br />\nsay that they fully approve of our<br />\nobjections, and even that we did<br />\nnot state them half strongly enough,<br />\nthat we are going to take the<br />\nmatter up again. In our letter<br />\ncolumn we publish a very few of<br />\nthe many letters we have received<br />\non the subject. They certainly indicate that a large part of the student body is back of us in our contention that the policies are ab-<br />\n<br />\nsurd and unconstitutional, and that<br />\nthe director of the gymnasium and<br />\ngraduate manager have usurped<br />\npower that was not conferred oil<br />\nthe director when the trustees appointed him or on the graduate<br />\nmanager by the students. We,<br />\ntherefore, call on the Athletic<br />\nBoard to hold a mass-meeting and<br />\nsubmit each article of the policy<br />\nto a referendum of the students.<br />\nWe invite letters on the subject<br />\nfrom all our subscribers.<br />\nTechnical School.<br />\n<br />\nA BUSINESS SCHOOL<br />\nOf Exceptional Merit<br />\n<br />\nSTRAYER'S<br />\n<br />\nBUSINESS COLLEGE, INC.<br />\nCHARLES and FAYETTE STS.<br />\nHandsome Catalog Free<br />\n<br />\nR.

The condition of the<br />\ngrounds made the playing ludicrous<br />\nat times, when two men came together in body-checking or when<br />\none tried to dodge the other. Falls<br />\nin the mud and water amused<br />\nthe small crowd of spectators at<br />\nevery point of the game.<br />\nThe closeness of the score is due<br />\nto Harvard's brace in the second<br />\nhalf. In the first half Hopkins<br />\nshowed good teamwork, and played<br />\nmost of the time in the Crimson<br />\nterritory. At the end of the half<br />\nthe score stood 3-1 in Hopkins'<br />\nfavor. Harvard scored first, after<br />\nfour and a half minutes' play, when<br />\nForistall passed to Blackett, who<br />\nshot the goal. During the next<br />\nfour minutes Hopkins got to their<br />\nfeet and scored three times. Paulus<br />\nsecured the ball in Hopkins' territory, passed to Gail, Gail to Easter,<br />\nwho scored the first Hopkins tally.<br />\nIn thirty seconds Gail shot the<br />\nsecond goal, after a relay from<br />\nEverton. Within three more minutes Gail scored a second time, after<br />\nsome clever dodging by Paulus,<br />\nwho passed him the ball.<br />\nAt this point Harvard braced up<br />\nand prevented further scoring. In<br />\nthe second half, however, three<br />\ngoals were credited to the visitors,<br />\nand only two to Hopkins. Harvard's defence tightened and her<br />\nattack played a more concerted<br />\ngame. Her inaccuracy in shooting<br />\nfor the net cost a number of goals<br />\nwhich, perhaps, would have won<br />\nthe game for the Crimson.

For<br />\neleven years he has directed the<br />\ndestinies of the University\u2014a period marked by steady growth,<br />\nconstant progress, and wise preparation for the expansion yet to<br />\ncome. During that time two great<br />\nendowment funds have been raised.<br />\nDuring that time the Homewood<br />\nidea has been conceived and safely<br />\nbrought to the very eve of realization. And now the leader who has<br />\nguided us through these years of<br />\ntoil and unrewarded hope, halts<br />\nupon the borders of the promised<br />\nland and resigns his trust to other<br />\nhands. President Remsen's selfsacrifice is worthy of the highest<br />\nadmiration. To another will belong the honor of installing the University at Homewood; to another<br />\nwill belong the glory of presiding<br />\nover it in the years of prosperity,<br />\nwhen fitly housed and fitly equipped<br />\nit will take its place at the head<br />\nof the universities \u2022of America; but<br />\nlet us not forget that these things<br />\nwould never have been possible but<br />\nfor the quiet effort and provident<br />\nsagacity of the man who is now<br />\nlaying down his leadership.<br />\n\"<br /><br />\nThe New Athletic Policies.<br /><br />\nIt will be remembered that in<br />\nthe last issue of THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwe devoted a good deal of space<br />\nand attention to the new athletic<br />\npolicies and our views on the subject. It is not necessary to rehash<br />\nthem again. But since that time<br />\nwe have heard so many students<br />\nsay that they fully approve of our<br />\nobjections, and even that we did<br />\nnot state them half strongly enough,<br />\nthat we are going to take the<br />\nmatter up again. In our letter<br />\ncolumn we publish a very few of<br />\nthe many letters we have received<br />\non the subject. They certainly indicate that a large part of the student body is back of us in our contention that the policies are ab-<br /><br />\nsurd and unconstitutional, and that<br />\nthe director of the gymnasium and<br />\ngraduate manager have usurped<br />\npower that was not conferred oil<br />\nthe director when the trustees appointed him or on the graduate<br />\nmanager by the students. We,<br />\ntherefore, call on the Athletic<br />\nBoard to hold a mass-meeting and<br />\nsubmit each article of the policy<br />\nto a referendum of the students.<br />\nWe invite letters on the subject<br />\nfrom all our subscribers.<br />\nTechnical School.<br /><br />\nA BUSINESS SCHOOL<br />\nOf Exceptional Merit<br /><br />\nSTRAYER'S<br /><br />\nBUSINESS COLLEGE, INC.<br />\nCHARLES and FAYETTE STS.<br />\nHandsome Catalog Free<br /><br />\nR.

It seems a<br />\ncoincidence that these two men,<br />\nWho Came to Baltimore together in<br />\n1896, should both leave together_<br />\nthe former for a place of great responsibility at Harvard, where he<br />\nobtained his medical training ; the<br />\nlatter, a graduate of the University.<br />\nof Toronto, for the Jefferson Medical School of Philadelphia. Here<br />\nDr. McCrae will occupy the chair<br />\nof medicine, which has been held by<br />\nsuch distinguished men as Dr.-John<br />\nK. Mitchell, the father of S. Weir<br />\nMitchell, and Dr. J. M. De Costa,<br />\nthe noted diagnostician.<br />\nAbout the same time, Dr. William S. Thayer, professor of clinical medicine and the successor of<br />\nOr. .0sler, was called tO the chair<br />\nof clinical medicine at Harvard.<br />\nOr. Thayer's decision was taken<br />\nafter the utmost reflection, and he<br />\ngave out the following reason for<br />\nremaining in Baltimore: \"I have<br />\n-decided to remain at the Johns<br />\nIjopkins, where I feel that the opPortmiities are larger.

The money will be raised<br />\nby a bond issue.<br />\nThe bill further provides that<br />\nin the new school there shall be<br />\n129 free scholarships, apportioned<br />\nto residents of Baltimore city and<br />\nthe various counties in accordance<br />\nwith their respective representation<br />\nin the House of Delegates; there<br />\nshall be six scholarships at large,<br />\nand three allotted to each of the<br />\nfollowing colleges: Loyola, Maryland Agricultural, Mt. St. Mary's,<br />\nRock Hill, St. John's, Washington, and Western Maryland. The<br />\nscholarships from these colleges<br />\nshall be given to applicant having<br />\nthe best scholastic standing, regardless of their financial circumstances; the holders of the other<br />\nscholarships must be deserving<br />\nyoung men who could not get a<br />\ntechnical education unless free tuition were given them.<br />\nOf the 129 free scholarships, 27<br />\nwill carry with them an additional<br />\n$200 which is intended to help out<br />\npoor boys who could not come<br />\neven if they had a scholarship.
