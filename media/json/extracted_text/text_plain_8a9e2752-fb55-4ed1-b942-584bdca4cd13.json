Oxford and Cambridge are the two<br />\ngreat educational institutions of the realm, and<br />\nit is the thing for young men of the best families<br />\nto spend some years at one or the other of the<br />\nUniversities. All the sons of the nobility and all<br />\nothers who can afford it in all classes are enrolled<br />\nthere. The Universities have the flower of the<br />\nthe English youth. Among all these wealthy<br />\nscions of noble houses, it would be only natural<br />\nto find some idlers, and some who merely come<br />\nfor the social advantages. But the majority of<br />\nthe students are good workers and some who<br />\ndo not seem to work hard in term, often work<br />\nexceedingly hard in vacation.<br />\nThe students are democratic and unconventional in many ways. You know the Oxford<br />\nstudents are required to wear cap and gown, at<br />\nlectures always, and out on the street during<br />\ncertain hours. They wear the mortarboard cap<br />\nin good orthodox fashion, but the gown, alas,<br />\nthey wear in the most untoward style. Some of<br />\nthem wear it in shreds and tatters,\u2014the .more<br />\ndilapidated the better;\u2014some carry it on their<br />\narm, or swing it all doubled up in the hand;<br />\nsome twist it around their neck for a scarf; any<br />\nway but the plain way in which it was intended<br />\nto be worn.<br />\nThe students strongly believe in physical prowess. It is rare for a student to wear an overcoat, even in the coldest weather. If he carries<br />\na heavy rough cane, he is considered sufficiently protected from the weather and all else.<br />\nHe is in all this way cultivating a heroic endurance.<br />\nHe runs around on the banks of the Isis,even in<br />\nmid-winter, scantily clad in a pair of white flannels,not reaching down to the bare knees. Then<br />\nhe shiver's and stands around with hands in his<br />\npockets and no cap on,along the river bank with<br />\nan occasional row in the boats. This is also the<br />\nhardening process. It looks like an invitation<br />\n<br />\nNo. 4.<br />\n<br />\nto rheumatism or pleurisy. But some of the<br />\nstudents still live and flourish.<br />\nThe classic Isis,\u2014as the river Thames is called<br />\nas it flows through Oxford, is one of the great<br />\ndelights of the University city. It gives beauty<br />\nof scenery, and plenty of sport in swimming,<br />\nboating, fishing and skating. All the year<br />\nround the river is used in some way, and one<br />\nsoon learns to love the little stream.<br />\nThe greatest week on the river is the last of<br />\nMay and the first of June. It is Boating Week<br />\nor the Eighth Week, so called because there are<br />\neight men in each boat, each boat therefore an<br />\neight, and there are twenty or more colleges reprepresented by a boat apiece, the men in rowing<br />\nsuits of distinctive colors and each boat flaunting its college flag.<br />\nThey race every day at four o'clock and six<br />\no'clock for six suceessive days. It is sometimes<br />\nvery exciting. For there is an intense rivalry<br />\namong the colleges. The coveted honor for the<br />\ncollege is to be water champion, or \"head of the<br />\nriver,\" as they call it.<br />\nThe course is about a mile, from Iffley Mill to<br />\nFolly Bridge. Great crowds of students run<br />\nalong the bank with the racers, shouting and<br />\nsinging, ringing bells and blowing horns. It is<br />\ntremenous noise and enthusiasm. Here they<br />\nshout,\u2014\"Go it Merton!\" \"Steady,Brasenose!\"<br />\nInteresting it is to see the other boats come<br />\npast to salute the victor. The salute is made by<br />\nthe crews adroitly tossing their oars in the air.<br />\nEvery once in a while a crew will lose their<br />\nequilibrium, and over goes their boat, and the<br />\nrowers are immersed in the river. This boating<br />\nweek is the great week at Oxford, greater than<br />\nCommencement, which is called Commemoration, and which is a rather dry and formal affair.<br />\nBoating Week brings the crowds of fond<br />\nmammas and sisters and pretty sweethearts,<br />\nand the little city is full of gaiety and beauty.<br />\nThere are also all sorts of festivities besides the<br />\nraces. The week is crowded with concerts,<br />\ndances, river excursions, punting trips, houseboat parties and tally-ho parties. But the daily<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nraces are the great social feature. The river<br />\nside has perhaps twenty great handsome barges<br />\n(some of them once belonged to the ancient<br />\nguilds of London and were used in the Lord<br />\nMayor's river show in olden days), floating<br />\nhouses exquisitely furnished. And here tea is<br />\nserved between races in elegant style. The<br />\nflower of all England, its beauty and culture and<br />\nwealth is here in Oxford for Boating Week.<br />\nThe greatest boating contest of the year, however, and for which everything else is a prepararation, is the annual race with their rival university, Cambridge. We went down to London<br />\nto see this one Saturday in March. The course<br />\nwas on the Thames from Putney to Mortlake,<br />\nfour miles and a quarter. We were well up near<br />\nthe finish. There were enormous crowds and<br />\ntremendous excitement. The Oxford boys came<br />\nin first as they had usually done for some years<br />\nbefore. We were proud of the Oxford blue<br />\nStrange, the race was over at four o'clock, by<br />\nLondon time, and the results of it were published in the New York papers at one o'clock,<br />\nthree hours before. Curious the results of the<br />\ntime differences between the two points.<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\n0. H.<br />\n<br />\nTHE LURID STREAK.<br />\n<br />\nBy Another Hope.<br />\nI am an elphberg.

She was<br />\nthere!<br />\n\"Yes,\" I hissed, on principle.<br />\n\"Is oo there ?\"<br />\n\"Ah, Fluvia, I have conic, I have come.\" She<br />\nsnivelled softly\u2014also on principle.<br />\n\"Is oo safe?\" Though my position was a<br />\nhazardous one, I endeavored to reassure her.<br />\n\"This is a ground-floor window and the<br />\nmoat\u2014.\" At mention of the moat, I could hear<br />\nher frame shudder. I had expected this, and<br />\ninwardly cursed my carelessness.<br />\n\"The moat,\" I added quickly, \"is only three<br />\nfeet deep.\" It was four, but Heaven will forgive<br />\nthe lie. She shrieked, but opened the window.<br />\nWWW<br />\nIn doing so, however, she disturbed the poise of<br />\nNOVELTIES BY UNERRING QUILLS. the spring blind. There was a whirr, followed<br />\nby a sharp ping, as the spring blind drew me up<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER realizes the ever-quickening with a vicious jerk. Myfeet were on the window<br />\ncompetition which exists in modern American sill, and I was safe. I could not but look at my<br />\nperiodical literature, and is making gigantic reflection in the window-pane. There I stood,<br />\nefforts to keep abreast of the times. It is with with the mellow moon-light flooding my crimson<br />\ngreat pleasure that we announce a series of nov- hair\u2014I hate to do this\u2014and my finely chisseled<br />\nelties by the most fashionable and strenuous features outlined against the darkness of the<br />\nwriters of modern fiction, a few of whom we night. My high hat made me look every inch of<br />\nmention with thrills of pardonable pride: An- my six feet two; a cut-a-way coat with wellother Hope, Dick Thirty cents, Davis, the Bore padded shoulders set off my naturally fine figure<br />\nreporter; Miss May Johnsing, who wrote,\"To to advantage; and a pair of plaid golf stockings<br />\nHave and to Strangle-hold\"; Theodore Rough- brought out the beauties of my well-turned<br />\nhouse Roozefelt, the father of the polite dime- calves. How could she help it!

The first of chair. There was a rustling noise as of advancing footsteps. I stopped.<br />\nthis most promising series is<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n\"The six ?\" I questioned, replacing my foot<br />\nupon the window-sill and gauging the jump with<br />\na hurried glance.<br />\n\"No,rats!\" she whispered,\"butlam not afraid<br />\nwhen you are here.\" I stepped into the room,and<br />\nwe clinched. Alas, my chance question wasto be<br />\nanswered truly, but too late. For at that moment<br />\nthe door burst open,and Blue Mike,accompanied<br />\nby the Six, entered. Drawing my rapier, I fell<br />\nupon them. With one lunge, I spitted three of<br />\nthe six, and there remained but Detchard,Rupert<br />\nof Hofbrau, Blue Mike, and the Belgian. Their<br />\nfour blades beat upon my guard with keen fury,<br />\nbut Fluvia's eves were upon me, and I never<br />\nfaltered. Our swords twinkled and threshed<br />\nabout iu the room until the heat became intense.<br />\nMy nerves were drawn as tight as piano-strings,<br />\nand I felt keyed to a high pitch. After an hour<br />\nand a half, the Belgian fell exhausted, but the<br />\nremaining three seemed comparatively fresh. I<br />\nfelt myself weakening,but gathered my energies<br />\nand finished Detchard with a neat uppercut.<br />\nBlue Mike, beside himself with rage at the sight<br />\nof so many of his followers strewn about,<br />\nrushed upon me blindly. I turned aside his point<br />\ndexterously,and lunged forward with such force<br />\nthat my rapier penetrated two double thicknesses of Harveyized corsets, and came out at<br />\nthe other side. In an endeavor to withdraw it,<br />\nmy good blade snapped, leaving me helpless\u2014at<br />\nthe mercy of that arch devil, Rupert of Hofbrau.<br />\nThe young villain laughed mockingly and flung<br />\nhis golden curls to the gentle breeze which wafted<br />\nthrough the open casement.<br />\n\"I will kill you first, Sire,\" he said, bowing<br />\n\"and then\u2014\" He paused, and glanced impudently over my shoulder at the white figure of<br />\nthe Princess, outlined in the gloom.<br />\n\"You saucy thing,\" I snarled like a trapped<br />\ntiger. (I)id you ever hear a trapped tiger snarl?<br />\nNeither did I, but it's very effective.<br />\n\"The bauld piece!\" re-echoed the princess, not<br />\nin the least like a trapped tigress. Rupert's sneering smile fired my blood. And I leaped upon<br />\nhim, wrenched away his rapier and sent it spin<br />\nfling through the open casement. Whereupon we<br />\nfell to with the weapons nature had given us, and<br />\nI crossed high, receiving a stiff counter on the<br />\njaw. It was then that the princess called tome:<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\"Don't mind his head, Razzy ; hit him in the<br />\nslats.\" I followed her opportune advice delivering a stiff body-punch which broke two of<br />\nyoung Rupert's ribs and bent his spinal column.<br />\nHe reeled backward, staggered forward, summoned his ebbing energies with a supreme effort<br />\nand catght me a stinging swipe across my royal<br />\nelpliberg. Without more ado, I put him out.<br />\nWhen I was quite through, I heard the princess<br />\nsigh slightly and murmur:<br />\n\"0, Razzy!\"<br />\n\"Call me Rudolph!\"I pleaded; \"call me anything but Razzy!\" I never heard her answer,<br />\nfor at that moment my elphberg began to bleed<br />\nprofusely. So, taking one last, longing look, I<br />\ndeparted through the window,leaving upon the<br />\nnew brussels carpet a lurid streak.<br />\nAnd upon every anniversary of our parting,<br />\nI receive one red, red rose.<br />\nU-.<br />\n<br />\nTHE SCORE IS ROLLING UP.<br />\n(\"PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IS THE BASIS OF ALL<br />\n<br />\nTRUE<br />\n<br />\nLITERATURE.\")<br />\n<br />\nTune \"John Brown's Body.\"<br />\n<br />\nHopkins' team is lining up upon the field,<br />\nHopkins' team is lining up upon the field,<br />\nHopkins' men are lining up around the field,<br />\nThe score is naught to naught.<br />\nthem, Hopkins, Hopkins, hold them.<br />\nHold them, Hopkins, Hopkins, hold them.<br />\nPush them, Hopkins, Hopkins, push them.<br />\nThe score is naught to naught.<br />\n<br />\nCHORUS.\u2014Hold<br />\n<br />\nIL<br />\nHopkins' line is rolling onward to the goal,<br />\nHopkins' line is rolling onward to the goal,<br />\nHopkins' ball is lying right beside the goal,<br />\nThe score is naught to naught.<br />\nCHORUS.\u2014Hold<br />\n<br />\nthem, Hopkins, etc.<br />\n<br />\nFlags of Black and Blue are waving over us.<br />\nFlags of Black and Blue are waving over us,<br />\nAll the Hopkins girls are raving over us,<br />\nThe score is six to naught.<br />\nare rooting, Hopkins, rooting,<br />\nWe are rooting, Hopkins, rooting,<br />\nAll the Hopkins whistles tooting,<br />\nThe score is rolling up.<br />\n0.

JOHN'S, 5 t HOPKINS. 5.<br />\nSaturday's game was one which will long be<br />\nremembered by all who witnessed it. Thc<br />\nelements were favorable in the afternoon, in<br />\nspite of the drizzling rain in the morning, and<br />\nthe grounds were in fair condition. A goodly<br />\nnumber of rooters assembled at Camden Station<br />\nto accompany the team to Annapolis. The<br />\nscene on the train was one of jollification and<br />\nrough-house, Chief rooter Swindell presiding<br />\nas usual, ably seconded by sub-chief rooter Lew<br />\nWhite. The morning was spent in \"doing\" the<br />\n\u2022 town. The Naval Academy, the Capitol and<br />\nother places of interest were visited and some<br />\ntook pains to see whether or not the town was<br />\n\"local option.\". Later, the decision was in<br />\nfavor of the negative. The team dined at St.<br />\nJohn's College, the rooters at the Chesapeake.<br />\nAbout two o'clock the latter lined up at the<br />\nstation to be reinforced by those coming down<br />\non the afternoon train. They all then marched to<br />\nthe grounds, rending the air with yells and<br />\nhideous noises, to find the teams putting on the<br />\nfinishing touches before the game. At 2.40 the<br />\nteams lined up. Every one knew that it was<br />\na case of when \"Greek meets Greek.\" Both sides<br />\nwent at each other for blood, and although the<br />\nrooters had given the \"Undertaker\" yell several<br />\ntimes for the edification of the crowd, it soon<br />\nbecame evident that there was \"another little<br />\njob\" for the Hopkins Team as well as for the<br />\nUndertaker, and that the aforesaid job was no<br />\n\"cinch.\" Our team clearly outplayed St. John's<br />\nat every point, putting up a much stronger game<br />\nthan they. We kept the ball in their territory<br />\nmost of the time during the 1st half, but lost it<br />\nwithin 15 yds. of their goal, twice on fumbles,<br />\nonce on downs. The 1st half ended with the<br />\nscore 0 to 0. At the beginning of the second<br />\nhalf, Hopkins kicked off and in 3 or 4 minutes<br />\nSt. Johns had advanced the ball to the centre of<br />\nthe field. Then Wells of St. Johns went around<br />\nright end for a 25 yd. gain, bringing the ball to<br />\nour 30 yd. line. The opposing team then tried<br />\ntheir end plays around left end. Having finally<br />\ngotten the ball on a fumble by one of their own<br />\nmen,St.Johns scored a touchdown, but failed to<br />\n<br />\nkick a goal. After that St.John's put up their best<br />\ngame. They hit our line at a terrific rate, often<br />\nmaking ten yard gains and keeping the ball in<br />\nour territory a good part of the time. When the<br />\nlast half was finished, all but six minutes, we had<br />\nthe ball on our 7 yd. line. And it was a case of<br />\n\"root hog or die, and root quick\" for the<br />\nHopkins team. Then came a finish sufficient<br />\nto satisfy the enthusiasm of any football crank.<br />\nIn 5 min. and 55 secs. we had put the pig skin<br />\nwithin 4 yds. of their goal, with three beautiful<br />\nend runs, one made by Riggs, the other two by<br />\nTyler. The teams having lined up, Riggs<br />\nwent through for a touchdown just as time was<br />\nup, and the rooters gave an exhibition of an<br />\nameteur insane asylum. The ball was kicked<br />\nout by Riggs. Caster seemed to catch it<br />\nfairly, but the umpire said he (Casler) moved<br />\nhis loot, so the game was ended with a score of<br />\n5 to 5.<br />\nThe contest on the whole was clean and fast<br />\nfrom beginning to end.<br />\nBlanck played a good steady game, so did<br />\nMeadows.<br />\nButler's playing was as usual up to the notch<br />\nand well nigh perfect in every detail.<br />\nThe end runs of Riggs and Tyler were distinguishing features of the game.<br />\nThe team as a whole played in excellent form<br />\nand was in far better shape at the end of the<br />\ngame than St. John's.<br />\nWells and Spates put up the best game for St.<br />\nJohn's.<br />\nThis game gives Hopkinsthe championship,as<br />\nwe were champions at the beginning of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nST.

OF MD., 0.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins foot-ball season closed<br />\ntriumphantly on Thanksgiving Day when the<br />\nwearers of the black and blue defeated their<br />\nlong time rivals, the University of Maryland, at<br />\nUnion Park. The day was perfect, and the field<br />\nin good condition,but what proved the greatest<br />\nincentive for each canvas-clad warrior to do his<br />\nutmost to win was thefact that from the grandstand hundreds of fair eyes were focused upon<br />\nhim. The two elevens played clean, hard, fast<br />\nfoot-ball, and one very gratifying thing was the<br />\nabsence of any dirty playing which would tend<br />\nto mar the game. The game was a triumph for<br />\namateur sport. University of Maryland had<br />\nremoved from her team every man who could<br />\nnot play under the amateur definitions cited in<br />\nthe Intercollegiate Official Hand-Book. It was<br />\na contest of bona-fide student against bona-fide<br />\nstudent; and now that the two universities<br />\nthoroughly understand each other and are<br />\nunited in their determination to stand for<br />\nstraight foot-ball, there is every reason to believe that\"peace and harmony shall continue to<br />\nreign,\" and the annual game become a permanent institution.<br />\nThe foot-ball policy of Johns Hopkins is a<br />\nwell defined, though, in this city we regret to<br />\nsay, almost a unique one. We stand for amateurism, and we maintain that our bona-fide<br />\nstudent team is equal to any bona-fide student<br />\nteam that any college in Baltimore can produce.<br />\nBut to return to the subject, the Thanksgiving<br />\nDay game. Our team played as a unit, and<br />\nthat consistent team work won the game for<br />\nus. The Doctors on the other hand played individually; team work was lacking. Their punting was good.<br />\nIn vain the Doctors hammered the Hopkins<br />\nline; it was unmovable. But when the Black<br />\nand Blue had possession of the ball \"why every<br />\ntime they hit the line they went right through.\"<br />\nAgain and again Butler tore great holes through<br />\nthat Maryland line; again and again our backs<br />\nplunged through it for heavy gains, and it was<br />\nthis continual pounding that gave Hopkins a<br />\ntouchdown after ten minutes of play, Butler<br />\ncarrying it over the line. Riggs kicked goal.<br />\nAfter the ball was again kicked off, Hopkins<br />\n<br />\n(by two serious fumbles)lost it twice in rapid<br />\nsuccession. Then some punting was indulged<br />\nin and in this Maryland showed to better advantage, for on interchange of kicks \"Mike\"<br />\nGriffin of Maryland came out ahead of our men.<br />\nIn the second half the Black and Blue resorted<br />\nto this hammering again and again and by an<br />\nuninterrupted series of gains the ball was taken<br />\nfrom our 25-yard line to Univ. of Maryland's<br />\n1-yard line and then Blanck carried it over for<br />\nHopkins' second touch-down. Riggs kicked<br />\ngoal. The ball was kicked off by Maryland<br />\nand Hopkins again began a steady advance<br />\ndown the field. It was evident that she had<br />\nMaryland \"going\" and it was only the darkness<br />\nthat prevented a larger score from being rolled up.<br />\nThe teams lined up as follows:<br />\nPOSITIONS.<br />\nUNIV.

Indeed it is hard for even the most<br />\nwary to know when it is time to pass along the<br />\ncorridors, for notices of the different practices<br />\nare posted often only a short while before the<br />\ntumult is to begin, so that the fortunate one has<br />\nlittle warning or chance to leave the building.<br />\nA great deal of credit is due Mr. Eyster, the<br />\nleader of the Glee Club for his skill and patience<br />\nin drilling the many men who have entered their<br />\nnames as candidates for the Club, for the majority of therri had had little or no previous experience in reading music. Another thing that he<br />\nshould be praised for is the thoroughness with<br />\nwhich he has rehearsed every piece till each man<br />\nknew his part perfectly. And whenever there<br />\nwas a sign of any part being weak, quartettes<br />\nwere straightway formed and the careless ones<br />\nquickly discovered. In this manner the full<br />\nstrength of every voice is assured.<br />\nThis same scheme was adopted last year in<br />\nthe Mandolin Club, with the result that it was<br />\nundoubtedly the best College Club that played<br />\nin Baltimore last winter. Mr. Moulton is continuing this practice and will assuredly meet<br />\nwith like success. In one respect this club is<br />\nbetter than previously, in that the pieces,<br />\nalthough comprising some very lively two-steps<br />\nand marches, are taken mostly from opera selections. For opera selections when played by a<br />\nMandolin Club are beautiful. This fact was<br />\nclearly shown by the enthusiastic manner in<br />\nwhich portions of \"The Singing Girl\" were<br />\nreceived last year. Then in still another aspect<br />\nthe Clubs have made an advance for this year.<br />\nThe Glee and Mandolin Clubs will have several<br />\npieces together, the mandolins playing a soft<br />\naccompaniment to the voices. The Banjo Club<br />\nhas taken a most decided \"brace,\" and with<br />\nmore banjos and banjeaurines bids fair to rival<br />\nits sister clubs.<br />\nBut it is needless to praise the Clubs so highly,<br />\nfor shortly after the -concert at Hannah Moore<br />\nAcademy, on December 7th, will come the Baltimore concert, and then every one will be a judge<br />\nunto himself.<br />\n<br />\nWITH APOLOGIES.<br />\n'T was the hour preceding dinner,<br />\nSomewhere 'long 'twixt five and six;<br />\nI was standing near the \"gym\" door<br />\nIdly holding down the bricks;<br />\nWhen there came from out the windows<br />\nOf McCoy a fearful din\u2014<br />\nHowls and groans and shrieks and rumblings!<br />\nWhat was going on within?<br />\nMore discordant grew the discord,<br />\nMore unearthly!

Oxford and Cambridge are the two<br />\ngreat educational institutions of the realm, and<br />\nit is the thing for young men of the best families<br />\nto spend some years at one or the other of the<br />\nUniversities. All the sons of the nobility and all<br />\nothers who can afford it in all classes are enrolled<br />\nthere. The Universities have the flower of the<br />\nthe English youth. Among all these wealthy<br />\nscions of noble houses, it would be only natural<br />\nto find some idlers, and some who merely come<br />\nfor the social advantages. But the majority of<br />\nthe students are good workers and some who<br />\ndo not seem to work hard in term, often work<br />\nexceedingly hard in vacation.<br />\nThe students are democratic and unconventional in many ways. You know the Oxford<br />\nstudents are required to wear cap and gown, at<br />\nlectures always, and out on the street during<br />\ncertain hours. They wear the mortarboard cap<br />\nin good orthodox fashion, but the gown, alas,<br />\nthey wear in the most untoward style. Some of<br />\nthem wear it in shreds and tatters,\u2014the .more<br />\ndilapidated the better;\u2014some carry it on their<br />\narm, or swing it all doubled up in the hand;<br />\nsome twist it around their neck for a scarf; any<br />\nway but the plain way in which it was intended<br />\nto be worn.<br />\nThe students strongly believe in physical prowess. It is rare for a student to wear an overcoat, even in the coldest weather. If he carries<br />\na heavy rough cane, he is considered sufficiently protected from the weather and all else.<br />\nHe is in all this way cultivating a heroic endurance.<br />\nHe runs around on the banks of the Isis,even in<br />\nmid-winter, scantily clad in a pair of white flannels,not reaching down to the bare knees. Then<br />\nhe shiver's and stands around with hands in his<br />\npockets and no cap on,along the river bank with<br />\nan occasional row in the boats. This is also the<br />\nhardening process. It looks like an invitation<br /><br />\nNo. 4.<br /><br />\nto rheumatism or pleurisy. But some of the<br />\nstudents still live and flourish.<br />\nThe classic Isis,\u2014as the river Thames is called<br />\nas it flows through Oxford, is one of the great<br />\ndelights of the University city. It gives beauty<br />\nof scenery, and plenty of sport in swimming,<br />\nboating, fishing and skating. All the year<br />\nround the river is used in some way, and one<br />\nsoon learns to love the little stream.<br />\nThe greatest week on the river is the last of<br />\nMay and the first of June. It is Boating Week<br />\nor the Eighth Week, so called because there are<br />\neight men in each boat, each boat therefore an<br />\neight, and there are twenty or more colleges reprepresented by a boat apiece, the men in rowing<br />\nsuits of distinctive colors and each boat flaunting its college flag.<br />\nThey race every day at four o'clock and six<br />\no'clock for six suceessive days. It is sometimes<br />\nvery exciting. For there is an intense rivalry<br />\namong the colleges. The coveted honor for the<br />\ncollege is to be water champion, or \"head of the<br />\nriver,\" as they call it.<br />\nThe course is about a mile, from Iffley Mill to<br />\nFolly Bridge. Great crowds of students run<br />\nalong the bank with the racers, shouting and<br />\nsinging, ringing bells and blowing horns. It is<br />\ntremenous noise and enthusiasm. Here they<br />\nshout,\u2014\"Go it Merton!\" \"Steady,Brasenose!\"<br />\nInteresting it is to see the other boats come<br />\npast to salute the victor. The salute is made by<br />\nthe crews adroitly tossing their oars in the air.<br />\nEvery once in a while a crew will lose their<br />\nequilibrium, and over goes their boat, and the<br />\nrowers are immersed in the river. This boating<br />\nweek is the great week at Oxford, greater than<br />\nCommencement, which is called Commemoration, and which is a rather dry and formal affair.<br />\nBoating Week brings the crowds of fond<br />\nmammas and sisters and pretty sweethearts,<br />\nand the little city is full of gaiety and beauty.<br />\nThere are also all sorts of festivities besides the<br />\nraces. The week is crowded with concerts,<br />\ndances, river excursions, punting trips, houseboat parties and tally-ho parties. But the daily<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nraces are the great social feature. The river<br />\nside has perhaps twenty great handsome barges<br />\n(some of them once belonged to the ancient<br />\nguilds of London and were used in the Lord<br />\nMayor's river show in olden days), floating<br />\nhouses exquisitely furnished. And here tea is<br />\nserved between races in elegant style. The<br />\nflower of all England, its beauty and culture and<br />\nwealth is here in Oxford for Boating Week.<br />\nThe greatest boating contest of the year, however, and for which everything else is a prepararation, is the annual race with their rival university, Cambridge. We went down to London<br />\nto see this one Saturday in March. The course<br />\nwas on the Thames from Putney to Mortlake,<br />\nfour miles and a quarter. We were well up near<br />\nthe finish. There were enormous crowds and<br />\ntremendous excitement. The Oxford boys came<br />\nin first as they had usually done for some years<br />\nbefore. We were proud of the Oxford blue<br />\nStrange, the race was over at four o'clock, by<br />\nLondon time, and the results of it were published in the New York papers at one o'clock,<br />\nthree hours before. Curious the results of the<br />\ntime differences between the two points.<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\n0. H.<br /><br />\nTHE LURID STREAK.<br /><br />\nBy Another Hope.<br />\nI am an elphberg.

I had expected this, and<br />\ninwardly cursed my carelessness.<br />\n\"The moat,\" I added quickly, \"is only three<br />\nfeet deep.\" It was four, but Heaven will forgive<br />\nthe lie. She shrieked, but opened the window.<br />\nWWW<br />\nIn doing so, however, she disturbed the poise of<br />\nNOVELTIES BY UNERRING QUILLS. the spring blind.

I stopped.<br />\nthis most promising series is<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n\"The six ?\" I questioned, replacing my foot<br />\nupon the window-sill and gauging the jump with<br />\na hurried glance.<br />\n\"No,rats!\" she whispered,\"butlam not afraid<br />\nwhen you are here.\" I stepped into the room,and<br />\nwe clinched. Alas, my chance question wasto be<br />\nanswered truly, but too late. For at that moment<br />\nthe door burst open,and Blue Mike,accompanied<br />\nby the Six, entered. Drawing my rapier, I fell<br />\nupon them. With one lunge, I spitted three of<br />\nthe six, and there remained but Detchard,Rupert<br />\nof Hofbrau, Blue Mike, and the Belgian. Their<br />\nfour blades beat upon my guard with keen fury,<br />\nbut Fluvia's eves were upon me, and I never<br />\nfaltered. Our swords twinkled and threshed<br />\nabout iu the room until the heat became intense.<br />\nMy nerves were drawn as tight as piano-strings,<br />\nand I felt keyed to a high pitch. After an hour<br />\nand a half, the Belgian fell exhausted, but the<br />\nremaining three seemed comparatively fresh. I<br />\nfelt myself weakening,but gathered my energies<br />\nand finished Detchard with a neat uppercut.<br />\nBlue Mike, beside himself with rage at the sight<br />\nof so many of his followers strewn about,<br />\nrushed upon me blindly. I turned aside his point<br />\ndexterously,and lunged forward with such force<br />\nthat my rapier penetrated two double thicknesses of Harveyized corsets, and came out at<br />\nthe other side. In an endeavor to withdraw it,<br />\nmy good blade snapped, leaving me helpless\u2014at<br />\nthe mercy of that arch devil, Rupert of Hofbrau.<br />\nThe young villain laughed mockingly and flung<br />\nhis golden curls to the gentle breeze which wafted<br />\nthrough the open casement.<br />\n\"I will kill you first, Sire,\" he said, bowing<br />\n\"and then\u2014\" He paused, and glanced impudently over my shoulder at the white figure of<br />\nthe Princess, outlined in the gloom.<br />\n\"You saucy thing,\" I snarled like a trapped<br />\ntiger. (I)id you ever hear a trapped tiger snarl?<br />\nNeither did I, but it's very effective.<br />\n\"The bauld piece!\" re-echoed the princess, not<br />\nin the least like a trapped tigress. Rupert's sneering smile fired my blood. And I leaped upon<br />\nhim, wrenched away his rapier and sent it spin<br />\nfling through the open casement. Whereupon we<br />\nfell to with the weapons nature had given us, and<br />\nI crossed high, receiving a stiff counter on the<br />\njaw. It was then that the princess called tome:<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n\"Don't mind his head, Razzy ; hit him in the<br />\nslats.\" I followed her opportune advice delivering a stiff body-punch which broke two of<br />\nyoung Rupert's ribs and bent his spinal column.<br />\nHe reeled backward, staggered forward, summoned his ebbing energies with a supreme effort<br />\nand catght me a stinging swipe across my royal<br />\nelpliberg. Without more ado, I put him out.<br />\nWhen I was quite through, I heard the princess<br />\nsigh slightly and murmur:<br />\n\"0, Razzy!\"<br />\n\"Call me Rudolph!\"I pleaded; \"call me anything but Razzy!\" I never heard her answer,<br />\nfor at that moment my elphberg began to bleed<br />\nprofusely. So, taking one last, longing look, I<br />\ndeparted through the window,leaving upon the<br />\nnew brussels carpet a lurid streak.<br />\nAnd upon every anniversary of our parting,<br />\nI receive one red, red rose.<br />\nU-.<br /><br />\nTHE SCORE IS ROLLING UP.<br />\n(\"PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IS THE BASIS OF ALL<br /><br />\nTRUE<br /><br />\nLITERATURE.\")<br /><br />\nTune \"John Brown's Body.\"<br /><br />\nHopkins' team is lining up upon the field,<br />\nHopkins' team is lining up upon the field,<br />\nHopkins' men are lining up around the field,<br />\nThe score is naught to naught.<br />\nthem, Hopkins, Hopkins, hold them.<br />\nHold them, Hopkins, Hopkins, hold them.<br />\nPush them, Hopkins, Hopkins, push them.<br />\nThe score is naught to naught.<br /><br />\nCHORUS.\u2014Hold<br /><br />\nIL<br />\nHopkins' line is rolling onward to the goal,<br />\nHopkins' line is rolling onward to the goal,<br />\nHopkins' ball is lying right beside the goal,<br />\nThe score is naught to naught.<br />\nCHORUS.\u2014Hold<br /><br />\nthem, Hopkins, etc.<br /><br />\nFlags of Black and Blue are waving over us.<br />\nFlags of Black and Blue are waving over us,<br />\nAll the Hopkins girls are raving over us,<br />\nThe score is six to naught.<br />\nare rooting, Hopkins, rooting,<br />\nWe are rooting, Hopkins, rooting,<br />\nAll the Hopkins whistles tooting,<br />\nThe score is rolling up.<br />\n0.

JOHN'S, 5 t HOPKINS. 5.<br />\nSaturday's game was one which will long be<br />\nremembered by all who witnessed it. Thc<br />\nelements were favorable in the afternoon, in<br />\nspite of the drizzling rain in the morning, and<br />\nthe grounds were in fair condition. A goodly<br />\nnumber of rooters assembled at Camden Station<br />\nto accompany the team to Annapolis. The<br />\nscene on the train was one of jollification and<br />\nrough-house, Chief rooter Swindell presiding<br />\nas usual, ably seconded by sub-chief rooter Lew<br />\nWhite. The morning was spent in \"doing\" the<br />\n\u2022 town. The Naval Academy, the Capitol and<br />\nother places of interest were visited and some<br />\ntook pains to see whether or not the town was<br />\n\"local option.\". Later, the decision was in<br />\nfavor of the negative. The team dined at St.<br />\nJohn's College, the rooters at the Chesapeake.<br />\nAbout two o'clock the latter lined up at the<br />\nstation to be reinforced by those coming down<br />\non the afternoon train. They all then marched to<br />\nthe grounds, rending the air with yells and<br />\nhideous noises, to find the teams putting on the<br />\nfinishing touches before the game. At 2.40 the<br />\nteams lined up. Every one knew that it was<br />\na case of when \"Greek meets Greek.\" Both sides<br />\nwent at each other for blood, and although the<br />\nrooters had given the \"Undertaker\" yell several<br />\ntimes for the edification of the crowd, it soon<br />\nbecame evident that there was \"another little<br />\njob\" for the Hopkins Team as well as for the<br />\nUndertaker, and that the aforesaid job was no<br />\n\"cinch.\" Our team clearly outplayed St. John's<br />\nat every point, putting up a much stronger game<br />\nthan they. We kept the ball in their territory<br />\nmost of the time during the 1st half, but lost it<br />\nwithin 15 yds. of their goal, twice on fumbles,<br />\nonce on downs. The 1st half ended with the<br />\nscore 0 to 0. At the beginning of the second<br />\nhalf, Hopkins kicked off and in 3 or 4 minutes<br />\nSt. Johns had advanced the ball to the centre of<br />\nthe field. Then Wells of St. Johns went around<br />\nright end for a 25 yd. gain, bringing the ball to<br />\nour 30 yd. line. The opposing team then tried<br />\ntheir end plays around left end. Having finally<br />\ngotten the ball on a fumble by one of their own<br />\nmen,St.Johns scored a touchdown, but failed to<br /><br />\nkick a goal. After that St.John's put up their best<br />\ngame. They hit our line at a terrific rate, often<br />\nmaking ten yard gains and keeping the ball in<br />\nour territory a good part of the time. When the<br />\nlast half was finished, all but six minutes, we had<br />\nthe ball on our 7 yd. line. And it was a case of<br />\n\"root hog or die, and root quick\" for the<br />\nHopkins team. Then came a finish sufficient<br />\nto satisfy the enthusiasm of any football crank.<br />\nIn 5 min. and 55 secs. we had put the pig skin<br />\nwithin 4 yds. of their goal, with three beautiful<br />\nend runs, one made by Riggs, the other two by<br />\nTyler. The teams having lined up, Riggs<br />\nwent through for a touchdown just as time was<br />\nup, and the rooters gave an exhibition of an<br />\nameteur insane asylum. The ball was kicked<br />\nout by Riggs. Caster seemed to catch it<br />\nfairly, but the umpire said he (Casler) moved<br />\nhis loot, so the game was ended with a score of<br />\n5 to 5.<br />\nThe contest on the whole was clean and fast<br />\nfrom beginning to end.<br />\nBlanck played a good steady game, so did<br />\nMeadows.<br />\nButler's playing was as usual up to the notch<br />\nand well nigh perfect in every detail.<br />\nThe end runs of Riggs and Tyler were distinguishing features of the game.<br />\nThe team as a whole played in excellent form<br />\nand was in far better shape at the end of the<br />\ngame than St. John's.<br />\nWells and Spates put up the best game for St.<br />\nJohn's.<br />\nThis game gives Hopkinsthe championship,as<br />\nwe were champions at the beginning of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nST.

OF MD., 0.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins foot-ball season closed<br />\ntriumphantly on Thanksgiving Day when the<br />\nwearers of the black and blue defeated their<br />\nlong time rivals, the University of Maryland, at<br />\nUnion Park. The day was perfect, and the field<br />\nin good condition,but what proved the greatest<br />\nincentive for each canvas-clad warrior to do his<br />\nutmost to win was thefact that from the grandstand hundreds of fair eyes were focused upon<br />\nhim. The two elevens played clean, hard, fast<br />\nfoot-ball, and one very gratifying thing was the<br />\nabsence of any dirty playing which would tend<br />\nto mar the game. The game was a triumph for<br />\namateur sport. University of Maryland had<br />\nremoved from her team every man who could<br />\nnot play under the amateur definitions cited in<br />\nthe Intercollegiate Official Hand-Book. It was<br />\na contest of bona-fide student against bona-fide<br />\nstudent; and now that the two universities<br />\nthoroughly understand each other and are<br />\nunited in their determination to stand for<br />\nstraight foot-ball, there is every reason to believe that\"peace and harmony shall continue to<br />\nreign,\" and the annual game become a permanent institution.<br />\nThe foot-ball policy of Johns Hopkins is a<br />\nwell defined, though, in this city we regret to<br />\nsay, almost a unique one. We stand for amateurism, and we maintain that our bona-fide<br />\nstudent team is equal to any bona-fide student<br />\nteam that any college in Baltimore can produce.<br />\nBut to return to the subject, the Thanksgiving<br />\nDay game. Our team played as a unit, and<br />\nthat consistent team work won the game for<br />\nus. The Doctors on the other hand played individually; team work was lacking. Their punting was good.<br />\nIn vain the Doctors hammered the Hopkins<br />\nline; it was unmovable. But when the Black<br />\nand Blue had possession of the ball \"why every<br />\ntime they hit the line they went right through.\"<br />\nAgain and again Butler tore great holes through<br />\nthat Maryland line; again and again our backs<br />\nplunged through it for heavy gains, and it was<br />\nthis continual pounding that gave Hopkins a<br />\ntouchdown after ten minutes of play, Butler<br />\ncarrying it over the line. Riggs kicked goal.<br />\nAfter the ball was again kicked off, Hopkins<br /><br />\n(by two serious fumbles)lost it twice in rapid<br />\nsuccession. Then some punting was indulged<br />\nin and in this Maryland showed to better advantage, for on interchange of kicks \"Mike\"<br />\nGriffin of Maryland came out ahead of our men.<br />\nIn the second half the Black and Blue resorted<br />\nto this hammering again and again and by an<br />\nuninterrupted series of gains the ball was taken<br />\nfrom our 25-yard line to Univ. of Maryland's<br />\n1-yard line and then Blanck carried it over for<br />\nHopkins' second touch-down. Riggs kicked<br />\ngoal. The ball was kicked off by Maryland<br />\nand Hopkins again began a steady advance<br />\ndown the field. It was evident that she had<br />\nMaryland \"going\" and it was only the darkness<br />\nthat prevented a larger score from being rolled up.<br />\nThe teams lined up as follows:<br />\nPOSITIONS.<br />\nUNIV.

Indeed it is hard for even the most<br />\nwary to know when it is time to pass along the<br />\ncorridors, for notices of the different practices<br />\nare posted often only a short while before the<br />\ntumult is to begin, so that the fortunate one has<br />\nlittle warning or chance to leave the building.<br />\nA great deal of credit is due Mr. Eyster, the<br />\nleader of the Glee Club for his skill and patience<br />\nin drilling the many men who have entered their<br />\nnames as candidates for the Club, for the majority of therri had had little or no previous experience in reading music. Another thing that he<br />\nshould be praised for is the thoroughness with<br />\nwhich he has rehearsed every piece till each man<br />\nknew his part perfectly. And whenever there<br />\nwas a sign of any part being weak, quartettes<br />\nwere straightway formed and the careless ones<br />\nquickly discovered. In this manner the full<br />\nstrength of every voice is assured.<br />\nThis same scheme was adopted last year in<br />\nthe Mandolin Club, with the result that it was<br />\nundoubtedly the best College Club that played<br />\nin Baltimore last winter. Mr. Moulton is continuing this practice and will assuredly meet<br />\nwith like success. In one respect this club is<br />\nbetter than previously, in that the pieces,<br />\nalthough comprising some very lively two-steps<br />\nand marches, are taken mostly from opera selections. For opera selections when played by a<br />\nMandolin Club are beautiful. This fact was<br />\nclearly shown by the enthusiastic manner in<br />\nwhich portions of \"The Singing Girl\" were<br />\nreceived last year. Then in still another aspect<br />\nthe Clubs have made an advance for this year.<br />\nThe Glee and Mandolin Clubs will have several<br />\npieces together, the mandolins playing a soft<br />\naccompaniment to the voices. The Banjo Club<br />\nhas taken a most decided \"brace,\" and with<br />\nmore banjos and banjeaurines bids fair to rival<br />\nits sister clubs.<br />\nBut it is needless to praise the Clubs so highly,<br />\nfor shortly after the -concert at Hannah Moore<br />\nAcademy, on December 7th, will come the Baltimore concert, and then every one will be a judge<br />\nunto himself.<br /><br />\nWITH APOLOGIES.<br />\n'T was the hour preceding dinner,<br />\nSomewhere 'long 'twixt five and six;<br />\nI was standing near the \"gym\" door<br />\nIdly holding down the bricks;<br />\nWhen there came from out the windows<br />\nOf McCoy a fearful din\u2014<br />\nHowls and groans and shrieks and rumblings!<br />\nWhat was going on within?<br />\nMore discordant grew the discord,<br />\nMore unearthly!
