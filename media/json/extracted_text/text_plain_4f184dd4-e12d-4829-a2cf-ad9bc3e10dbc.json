He states, as an<br />\nargument against the banning of<br />\natomic weapons, that the defenses of the U.S. and our allies<br />\ndepend largely on the use of<br />\natomic weapons and that the<br />\nCommunist countries would profit from their being banned.<br />\nThese statements are probably<br />\ntrue but in using them as an<br />\nargument against banning atomic<br />\nweapons he equates the value<br />\nof the survival of the West with<br />\nthe value of the survival of<br />\nhumanity.<br />\nMankind has reached a unique<br />\npoint in its development where<br />\nit is presented with the possibility of completely destroying<br />\nitself.

We must eliminate the possibility of this<br />\nnatural catastrophe before we<br />\nbegin worrying about whether a<br />\nparticular nation will survive or<br />\nnot.<br />\nThere will probably be those<br />\nwho view the survival of the<br />\nWest as extremely important to<br />\nhumanity.
