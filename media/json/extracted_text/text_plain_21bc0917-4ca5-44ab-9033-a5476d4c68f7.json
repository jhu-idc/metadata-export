This<br />\nis a question which has been before<br />\nthe undergraduates for some time<br />\nand which can be answered, we<br />\nbelieve, only in the affirmative.<br />\nThe university has been and is<br />\ntotally unprepared to handle the<br />\nalmost 100 per cent. increase in<br />\nstudent enrollment which has<br />\ntaken place in the last few years.<br />\nWe are not the only educational<br />\ninstitution to be faced by these<br />\nconditions, but nearly all of the<br />\nother colleges have already<br />\nadopted some drastic measures to<br />\ncurtail the number of entering<br />\nstudents.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 We must frankly face the fact<br />\nthat, as President Goodnow said,<br />\nthe facilities of the university<br />\nscarcely justify the present large<br />\nenrollment and are certainly inadequate for a larger number of<br />\nIn justice to the<br />\nstudents.<br />\nstudents who are already enrolled<br />\nand to those who are going to enter<br />\nin the future, the university must<br />\nlimit 'the number of undergraduates so that it can give each the<br />\nproper attention. Restricting the<br />\nsize of the entering class is the<br />\nlogical way to bring this situation<br />\nabout.<br />\nIf the entering class is to be restricted in numbers there must be<br />\nsome definite basis of selection, as<br />\nthe number of applicants will<br />\ngreatly exceed the number which<br />\ncan be admitted.<br />\nThis basis of selection should be,<br />\nwe feel, not scholarship alone, but<br />\nthe qualities of leadership and<br />\ncharacter of the applicant should<br />\nalso be taken into account. The<br />\nselection would be based, therefore, on scholarship, qualities of<br />\nleadership and character.<br />\nSuch additional information as<br />\nwould be required could be obtained by the addition to the present application blank of such<br />\nquestions as the committee of admissions and advanced standing<br />\ndeemed advisable and by demanding letters of reference,in addition<br />\nto this application. In any case of<br />\ndoubt between two or more applicants the question could be settled'<br />\nby their appearance before the<br />\ncommittee of admission and advanced standing, whose decision<br />\nwould be final.<br />\nWe believe that sueh a method<br />\nof selection is feasible and could<br />\neasily be worked out. We have<br />\nheard of similar and even more<br />\ndifficult systems having been successfully put into'operation. Some<br />\nsystem of restriction is necessary<br />\nand certainly this- suggestion is<br />\nworthy of careful consideration.<br />\nTHE JUNIOR-SENIOR DEBATE.<br />\n<br />\nfly planning to hold an informal<br />\ndance after the annual Adams debate, the Committee of Arrangements is making an effort to bring<br />\na larger crowd than usual out to<br />\nthis event. The popularity of both<br />\nVarsity and Class debates has<br />\npteadily decreased the last few<br />\nyears, and some method of increasing the attendance is needed. It<br />\nwas only after some argument,<br />\nhowever, that the committee obtained permission to try the proposed scheme.<br />\nWhether their plan will be successful or not depends on the students themselves.

I)<br />\n<br />\nthe greatest sum total of facts and<br />\ninformation but it would never<br />\ndevelop the thirst for knowledge,<br />\nand it would never develop any<br />\npowers of original thinking. How<br />\nOften do you find a boy in prep<br />\nschool who turns aside from his<br />\ndaily assignments to make some<br />\nindependent inquiries? Individualism is stultified by routine.<br />\nThere are other incidental objections to this system, such as the<br />\nnumber of instructors re'quirea..<br />\nIn the second place we might<br />\nput into effect the system which,<br />\nI believe has been the theoretical<br />\none at Hopkins\u2014responsibility on<br />\nthe part of the student, checked<br />\nup by semi-annual examinations.<br />\nSuch a method has a fatal flaw.<br />\nAn hour's' work during the week<br />\nbefore exams is worth three hours<br />\nearlier in the year, as far as passing is concerned/ I would not<br />\nhesitate to say that seven-eights<br />\nof the students here are chiefly *concerned with the results of their<br />\nexaminations and not with the acquisition of knowledge. Hence<br />\nthey cram and acquire a knowledge which does not last two weeks<br />\nafter the examination. The work<br />\nwhich counts, work done regularly<br />\nthrough the year, is generally neglected, except in preparation for<br />\nquizzes. This sounds like a very<br />\nnaive attack on a well planned<br />\nsystem, but I am presenting the<br />\nstudents' view, and they are generally agreed in regard to these<br />\nfacts. What Senior, Phi Beta<br />\nKappa men included, can pass a<br />\ncourse which he has not taken<br />\nsince Freshman year?<br />\nLastly, a college may adopt the<br />\nEnglish system of placing absaute<br />\nresponsibility on the student, by<br />\nPostponing examinations for one,<br />\nor, better, two or three years. This<br />\nplaces his work in a new light in<br />\nthe eyes of the student. He realizes<br />\nthat the best way to pass is to<br />\n<br />\nlearn, and he studies with that end<br />\nin view, reading all the important<br />\nliterature of a subject and reviewing when necessary. We sometimes encounter a subject which<br />\ncannot be crammed, for it covers<br />\nThat is the<br />\ntoo much ground.<br />\nsecret of this-last alternative.No<br />\nman can put off all the work covered in such a long period. He<br />\ncannot afford to procrastinate or<br />\nbe very irregular in his studying.<br />\nThe responsibility is obvious\u2014the<br />\ninevitability slaps him in the face.<br />\nSuch a system would afford the<br />\nstudent the greatest possible incentive and requirements of the<br />\nuniversity could be standardized<br />\nand adjusted at will. The English<br />\nuniversities are ahead of us, and<br />\ntheir success shows that high<br />\nschool methods are not necessary<br />\nin college.<br />\nH.

The Junior-Senior debate this year is to be followed\u2022<br />\nfor the first time in the history of<br />\nHopkins debating by an informal<br />\ndance. The debate, the subject<br />\nof which is the American immigration question, will begin<br />\npromptly at 8 o'clock on the night<br />\nof March 19, and anyone who is<br />\nnot in the C. E. Hall by that hour<br />\nwill not be admitted to the dance<br />\nafterward.<br />\nThe Juniors, in aranging their<br />\ndebating contest this year and<br />\nremembering the woefully small<br />\nnumbers attendant on former class<br />\ndebates, decided that some step<br />\nmust be taken to assure the debaters an audience -large enough<br />\nto be called an audience. The<br />\ndance plan was the result. It was<br />\nthought best to have a card dance,<br />\nalthough it will be an informal one. Decorations will not be<br />\nlacking, for those used at the<br />\ncotillion the night before will still<br />\nbe in place. The Undergraduate<br />\nOrchestra will furnish the necessary jazz, and dancers needing<br />\nrefreshment will find it in the<br />\npunch for which 1922 has voted<br />\nthe sum of $15 from its treasury.<br />\nThe committee for the debate<br />\nconsists of Cotton, '22 (chairman); Pickford, '21; Wood, '22,<br />\nCards of<br />\nand Vanneman, '23.<br />\nadmission may be obtained from<br />\nmembers of this committee. The<br />\nonly restriction upon the issuing<br />\nof tickets is that he to whom one<br />\nis given come in time for the debate and bring, if possible, a fair<br />\npartner. Further than this (and<br />\nthe partner need be fair only in<br />\nher escort's eyes) the debate and<br />\ndance will be free.<br />\nB. S.

The class<br />\nwished it known that, though its<br />\nmembers would be unaffected by<br />\nany change, it would lend its suppost to the backers of the movement. A similar motion will be<br />\npresented to the other classes,<br />\nwhich will be able to consider it<br />\nwith the knowledge that the older<br />\nmen are in favor of it.<br />\nCoach Van Orman explained<br />\nthat with the present fee it will be<br />\nimpossible for the Athletic Association to maintain all of the nine<br />\nsports now on the list at Hopkins<br />\nand to give each enough money to<br />\nequip it suitably. The $15 allowance will permit a larger allowance for the swimming and tennis<br />\nteams and will aid them by a<br />\nlarger allotment to make guarantees sufficiently attractive to draw<br />\nthe larger colleges to Homewood.<br />\nFollowing the discussion and<br />\nballoting upon the athletic allowance, F.

All first<br />\nplaces were won by Rutgers men<br />\nexcept the breast stroke, which<br />\nwas captured by Rowland, of Hopkins.

This<br />\nis a question which has been before<br />\nthe undergraduates for some time<br />\nand which can be answered, we<br />\nbelieve, only in the affirmative.<br />\nThe university has been and is<br />\ntotally unprepared to handle the<br />\nalmost 100 per cent. increase in<br />\nstudent enrollment which has<br />\ntaken place in the last few years.<br />\nWe are not the only educational<br />\ninstitution to be faced by these<br />\nconditions, but nearly all of the<br />\nother colleges have already<br />\nadopted some drastic measures to<br />\ncurtail the number of entering<br />\nstudents.<br /><br />\n\u2022 We must frankly face the fact<br />\nthat, as President Goodnow said,<br />\nthe facilities of the university<br />\nscarcely justify the present large<br />\nenrollment and are certainly inadequate for a larger number of<br />\nIn justice to the<br />\nstudents.<br />\nstudents who are already enrolled<br />\nand to those who are going to enter<br />\nin the future, the university must<br />\nlimit 'the number of undergraduates so that it can give each the<br />\nproper attention. Restricting the<br />\nsize of the entering class is the<br />\nlogical way to bring this situation<br />\nabout.<br />\nIf the entering class is to be restricted in numbers there must be<br />\nsome definite basis of selection, as<br />\nthe number of applicants will<br />\ngreatly exceed the number which<br />\ncan be admitted.<br />\nThis basis of selection should be,<br />\nwe feel, not scholarship alone, but<br />\nthe qualities of leadership and<br />\ncharacter of the applicant should<br />\nalso be taken into account. The<br />\nselection would be based, therefore, on scholarship, qualities of<br />\nleadership and character.<br />\nSuch additional information as<br />\nwould be required could be obtained by the addition to the present application blank of such<br />\nquestions as the committee of admissions and advanced standing<br />\ndeemed advisable and by demanding letters of reference,in addition<br />\nto this application. In any case of<br />\ndoubt between two or more applicants the question could be settled'<br />\nby their appearance before the<br />\ncommittee of admission and advanced standing, whose decision<br />\nwould be final.<br />\nWe believe that sueh a method<br />\nof selection is feasible and could<br />\neasily be worked out. We have<br />\nheard of similar and even more<br />\ndifficult systems having been successfully put into'operation. Some<br />\nsystem of restriction is necessary<br />\nand certainly this- suggestion is<br />\nworthy of careful consideration.<br />\nTHE JUNIOR-SENIOR DEBATE.<br /><br />\nfly planning to hold an informal<br />\ndance after the annual Adams debate, the Committee of Arrangements is making an effort to bring<br />\na larger crowd than usual out to<br />\nthis event.

The Junior-Senior debate this year is to be followed\u2022<br />\nfor the first time in the history of<br />\nHopkins debating by an informal<br />\ndance. The debate, the subject<br />\nof which is the American immigration question, will begin<br />\npromptly at 8 o'clock on the night<br />\nof March 19, and anyone who is<br />\nnot in the C. E. Hall by that hour<br />\nwill not be admitted to the dance<br />\nafterward.<br />\nThe Juniors, in aranging their<br />\ndebating contest this year and<br />\nremembering the woefully small<br />\nnumbers attendant on former class<br />\ndebates, decided that some step<br />\nmust be taken to assure the debaters an audience -large enough<br />\nto be called an audience. The<br />\ndance plan was the result. It was<br />\nthought best to have a card dance,<br />\nalthough it will be an informal one. Decorations will not be<br />\nlacking, for those used at the<br />\ncotillion the night before will still<br />\nbe in place. The Undergraduate<br />\nOrchestra will furnish the necessary jazz, and dancers needing<br />\nrefreshment will find it in the<br />\npunch for which 1922 has voted<br />\nthe sum of $15 from its treasury.<br />\nThe committee for the debate<br />\nconsists of Cotton, '22 (chairman); Pickford, '21; Wood, '22,<br />\nCards of<br />\nand Vanneman, '23.<br />\nadmission may be obtained from<br />\nmembers of this committee. The<br />\nonly restriction upon the issuing<br />\nof tickets is that he to whom one<br />\nis given come in time for the debate and bring, if possible, a fair<br />\npartner. Further than this (and<br />\nthe partner need be fair only in<br />\nher escort's eyes) the debate and<br />\ndance will be free.<br />\nB. S.

The class<br />\nwished it known that, though its<br />\nmembers would be unaffected by<br />\nany change, it would lend its suppost to the backers of the movement. A similar motion will be<br />\npresented to the other classes,<br />\nwhich will be able to consider it<br />\nwith the knowledge that the older<br />\nmen are in favor of it.<br />\nCoach Van Orman explained<br />\nthat with the present fee it will be<br />\nimpossible for the Athletic Association to maintain all of the nine<br />\nsports now on the list at Hopkins<br />\nand to give each enough money to<br />\nequip it suitably. The $15 allowance will permit a larger allowance for the swimming and tennis<br />\nteams and will aid them by a<br />\nlarger allotment to make guarantees sufficiently attractive to draw<br />\nthe larger colleges to Homewood.<br />\nFollowing the discussion and<br />\nballoting upon the athletic allowance, F. L. Hubbard, Senior Treasurer, requested a promi)t payment<br />\nof class dues in order to allow the<br />\nHullabaloo to meet its current<br />\nbills, and R. S.
