The Honor System places the individual on his<br />\nhonor not to cheat in examinations, quizzes, laboratory or home<br />\nwork. This means that all written work presented as that of the<br />\nauthor must be original. Of course, in the last two cases a certain<br />\namount of co-operation is allowable, but this privilege should not be<br />\ntaken advantage of unfairly. The Honor System is therefore simply<br />\nan expression of the belief that every student at the University is a<br />\ngentleman and will conduct himself as such under all circumstances.<br />\nThe Honor System also presupposes, however, that, in addition<br />\nits rules, each student will take sufficient pride in the<br />\nobserving<br />\nto<br />\npersonnel of his Alma Mater to report arty infringement upon it<br />\nwhich he may observe. That this be done is vitally essential for the<br />\nsuccess of the system. No one likes to report a fellow student, but<br />\nwhen the interest of the college demands it, personal objections must<br />\nbe overcome. A man who cheats is one of the lowest specimens of the<br />\nhuman race and if he cheats at college he will cheat in business or in<br />\nwhatever line of work he goes into upon graduation. It is not right<br />\nthat such a man should bear the endorsement of Johns Hopkins, and<br />\nit is up to each individual student to see that he does not receive<br />\nthis honor.<br />\nThe Honor System is familiar to a number of students since<br />\nthey have had it in prep school. Some of the students, however,<br />\ncome from schools in which \"cribbing,\" while not encouraged, is not<br />\nfrowned upon severely by the students themselves. These students<br />\nmust remember that at college an entirely different attitude is taken<br />\nand govern themselves accordingly.<br />\nOccasionally a man has proved himself unworthy of the trust<br />\nimposed upon him by the Honor System, and his connection with the<br />\nUniversity has therefore been severed. We are able to state that<br />\nthe percentage of these cases has been very small in the past, and<br />\nwe trust that even this small percentage will be decreased in th,..;<br />\nfuture.<br />\n<br />\nA NEED FULFILLED<br />\nThe proposed Publicity Board, to be formed for the purpose of<br />\nspreading undergraduate propaganda throughout the country, will<br />\nfill a long-felt need. Hopkins is the best known American institution<br />\nof learning in Europe and is well known in the United States; this<br />\nreputation, however, is due to the high standard of the Medical and<br />\nGraduate Schools. The scholastic standing of this College of Arts<br />\nand Sciences and of the Engineering School, coupled with the rapid<br />\nstrides made by the undergraduates within the last few years in the<br />\ndevelopment of college life entitles these schools to almost equal<br />\nrecognition. Still the citizens of Baltimore and Maryland, and prep<br />\nschool graduates in particular seem oblivious to the fact that there<br />\nis an undergraduate body at Hopkins. If the Publicity Board can<br />\nbring this fact to their attention it will be doing Hopkins an enormous service.<br />\n<br />\nOUR NEXT ISSUE<br />\nThe next issue of the News-Letter will be dedicated to Woodrow<br />\nWilson and will appear on Monday as this day is to be observed<br />\nthroughout the country as Wilson Day.

The Honor System places the individual on his<br />\nhonor not to cheat in examinations, quizzes, laboratory or home<br />\nwork. This means that all written work presented as that of the<br />\nauthor must be original. Of course, in the last two cases a certain<br />\namount of co-operation is allowable, but this privilege should not be<br />\ntaken advantage of unfairly. The Honor System is therefore simply<br />\nan expression of the belief that every student at the University is a<br />\ngentleman and will conduct himself as such under all circumstances.<br />\nThe Honor System also presupposes, however, that, in addition<br />\nits rules, each student will take sufficient pride in the<br />\nobserving<br />\nto<br />\npersonnel of his Alma Mater to report arty infringement upon it<br />\nwhich he may observe. That this be done is vitally essential for the<br />\nsuccess of the system. No one likes to report a fellow student, but<br />\nwhen the interest of the college demands it, personal objections must<br />\nbe overcome. A man who cheats is one of the lowest specimens of the<br />\nhuman race and if he cheats at college he will cheat in business or in<br />\nwhatever line of work he goes into upon graduation. It is not right<br />\nthat such a man should bear the endorsement of Johns Hopkins, and<br />\nit is up to each individual student to see that he does not receive<br />\nthis honor.<br />\nThe Honor System is familiar to a number of students since<br />\nthey have had it in prep school. Some of the students, however,<br />\ncome from schools in which \"cribbing,\" while not encouraged, is not<br />\nfrowned upon severely by the students themselves. These students<br />\nmust remember that at college an entirely different attitude is taken<br />\nand govern themselves accordingly.<br />\nOccasionally a man has proved himself unworthy of the trust<br />\nimposed upon him by the Honor System, and his connection with the<br />\nUniversity has therefore been severed. We are able to state that<br />\nthe percentage of these cases has been very small in the past, and<br />\nwe trust that even this small percentage will be decreased in th,..;<br />\nfuture.<br /><br />\nA NEED FULFILLED<br />\nThe proposed Publicity Board, to be formed for the purpose of<br />\nspreading undergraduate propaganda throughout the country, will<br />\nfill a long-felt need. Hopkins is the best known American institution<br />\nof learning in Europe and is well known in the United States; this<br />\nreputation, however, is due to the high standard of the Medical and<br />\nGraduate Schools. The scholastic standing of this College of Arts<br />\nand Sciences and of the Engineering School, coupled with the rapid<br />\nstrides made by the undergraduates within the last few years in the<br />\ndevelopment of college life entitles these schools to almost equal<br />\nrecognition. Still the citizens of Baltimore and Maryland, and prep<br />\nschool graduates in particular seem oblivious to the fact that there<br />\nis an undergraduate body at Hopkins. If the Publicity Board can<br />\nbring this fact to their attention it will be doing Hopkins an enormous service.<br /><br />\nOUR NEXT ISSUE<br />\nThe next issue of the News-Letter will be dedicated to Woodrow<br />\nWilson and will appear on Monday as this day is to be observed<br />\nthroughout the country as Wilson Day.
