The<br />\nchairmen have worked hard to attend to two<br />\nconcerns: thoroughly addressing the topic<br />\nand enhancing the Symposium's reputation.<br />\nThe advantages of the latter are that it improves the Symposium for years to come<br />\nand generates prestige for undergraduate<br />\nstudies at Hopkins.<br />\nThis year, the chairmen, Salman Azhar<br />\nand Shaun Mitchell, have proved to be no<br />\nexception. For their topic, politics and the<br />\nmedia, they have found a balance in which<br />\nthey have drawn public 'big names' so as<br />\nto give the Symposium greater exposure<br />\nand have stayed within their budget in the<br />\nprocess. Equally important, it appears that<br />\nthey have managed this without sacrificing<br />\na fairly comprehensive look at the topic,<br />\nwhich is much to their credit.<br />\nThe arduous process of securing speakers<br />\nwas, as it is always, exacerbated by the confines of their allocated budget. The budget,<br />\nwhile nominally not insignificant, simply<br />\ndoes not even begin to cover the asking<br />\nprices for many public figures while working through normal agency channels.<br />\nThis is especially true for a topic for<br />\nwhich figures in both politics and the media<br />\nwould be recruited. Azhar and Mitchell<br />\nsnagged McFarlane and Will through<br />\nHopkins affiliations, though still at the expense of their entire allocation.<br />\nThe Symposium, however, is not without<br />\nits limitations. Because of its budget, there<br />\nare only four speakers total. Azhar and Mitchell are still searching for one more.<br />\nNevertheless, even if one is found, this<br />\n<br />\nspeaker's honorarium will have to financed by fund-raising, which so far has been<br />\nmost unsuccessful.<br />\nFour speakers will impart less information and fewer percpectives on the issue<br />\nthan it deserves. It is also unfortunate that<br />\nthe number of speakers was necessarily<br />\nfewer than the six of last year, and ten of<br />\nthe year before; three years ago, the symposium chairmen could only afford three<br />\nspeakers.<br />\nThat there are only four speakers places<br />\na special burden on the Symposium. It must<br />\ncontinue to offer as wide a breadth of opinion as possible\u2014and yet only four<br />\nspeakers will be contributing.<br />\nUnfortunate in this regard is that the two<br />\n'big name' speakers, McFarlane and Will,<br />\nare both conservatives. In the public eye,<br />\nthis conservative bias can detract from the<br />\nrespectability the Symposium chairmen<br />\nhave worked so hard to gain. It is important that future Symposia provide as much<br />\ndiversity as possible by seeing that all concerned interest groups are represented.<br />\nConsidering the rates of honoraria, simply throwing more money into the budget is<br />\nnot the only answer. There is no doubt,<br />\nhowever, that it would help.<br />\nIt would also help to select Symposia<br />\nchairmen ealier. This would provide the<br />\nchairmen with more time, and thus a better chance of approaching potential<br />\nspeakers before their schedules have filled.,<br />\nThe Symposium should continue to be a<br />\ndistinguished forum for topical discussion.<br />\nIts standards should not be lessened when<br />\nthis could be avoided by ample funding.<br />\n<br />\nCalling to Council<br />\nThis year's Student Council is getting off<br />\nto quite a slow start. Although a few different social programs are in the planning<br />\nstages, it appears that the Council's biggest<br />\nconcern lately has been their own attendance policy.<br />\nIt is no doubt critical for the Council to<br />\nhave solid, regular attendance at their<br />\nmeetings. As with any such organization,<br />\neach member contributes to the overall efficiency of the group. In addition, it is<br />\nnecessary to have a quorum for voting<br />\npurposes.<br />\nHowever, little else has been accomplished at these meetings so far this year. This<br />\nweek, Council President Scott FitzGerald<br />\nannounced that the Office of the Dean of<br />\nStudents has approved a \"Fall Festival\" to<br />\nbe held the weekend of Fall Break. An \"International Festival\", planned for early<br />\nNovember, was also discussed. Both are<br />\nsolid programs, but neither is anything<br />\nwe've never seen before.<br />\nIn a News-Letter interview last February,<br />\nFitzGerald said that it was his goal to focus<br />\nmore on social programming as well as<br />\ncommunity service in the Hopkins area. But<br />\nneither of these issues, beyond the Festival<br />\nplans, have yet been addressed in Council<br />\nmeetings.<br />\nLast year at this time Council had<br />\norganized a freshman forum which inform-<br />\n<br />\ned students about security at Homewood<br />\nand in the surrounding area. The issue of<br />\nsecurity resurfaced a number of times at last<br />\nyear's Council meetings: the group spent<br />\nmuch time discussing the problems with the<br />\nsecurity van service. Perhaps it was this<br />\nongoing debate which led to the University's purchase of a second escort van.<br />\nThe year's Council needs to address major issues such as this. Certainly there are<br />\nstill problems with security\u2014 much of the<br />\ncampus, for example, is inadequately lit.<br />\nCouncil also must come up with adequate<br />\nsocial programming for the semester. At<br />\nthis week's meeting, some members said<br />\nthat a number of fraternities are disobeying rules which prevent them from holding<br />\nparties during scheduled campus events.<br />\nFitzGerald suggested that Social Committee members should \"call the frats and tell<br />\nthem not to have a party.\" Perhaps a more<br />\nviable technique would be explicit coordinated efforts at programming between<br />\nuniversity-sponsored social committees and<br />\nfraternities.<br />\nThe Student Council has the potential to<br />\nbe a most influential campus group. Its<br />\nmembers should look beyond the prepara- \u2022<br />\ntion of attendance policies and begin to examine issues of importance for the entire<br />\ncampus.<br />\n<br />\nA Little Leeway<br />\nby A. Lee Davis<br />\nWhen I first came to Hopkins,<br />\nI expected to run into soft<br />\nSouthern accents, Jersey whines,<br />\nTennessean twangs, and innercity slurs. In no way was I<br />\nprepared for all the accents that<br />\nthe great Hopkins melting pot has<br />\nto offer: Greek, Arabic,<br />\nJapanese, French, Chinese,<br />\nChinese/British patois. The<br />\nsounds were so strange, I found<br />\nthat a dorm neighbor's \"Baa Harbaa\" Bostonian accent brought on<br />\nhomesickness.<br />\nIt took a little time and quite a<br />\nfew \"say that again's\" but I<br />\nmanaged to understand my<br />\nfriends' statements at least as well<br />\nas they understood my own. Once<br />\nwe had conquered the intonation<br />\nimpasse, we faced the dialect<br />\ndetour.

The Best Thing<br />\nAgainst Which To Do This is<br />\ncoincidentally the most likely the<br />\nthing to get you angry in the first<br />\nplace.

They are spread<br />\nthroughout campus, and are<br />\n<br />\nspreading further still, like a contagion. They have been the source<br />\nof more frustration to students,<br />\nfaculty, employees, and Post-doc<br />\nfellows alike than anything in<br />\nmemory.<br />\nI am speaking, of course, about<br />\nthe series of Seilers vending<br />\nmachines distributed around campus. How many times have you<br />\nscrounged around the library for<br />\ntwenty minutes, looking for someone to lend you a quarter so<br />\nyou can buy that needed soda, only to put your money in the<br />\nmachine and . . . surprise!! You<br />\n<br />\nwith anyone, had arrangements<br />\nwhich were agreeable to the author<br />\nof the article and the News-Letter<br />\nstaff been made ahead of time,<br />\nand had the News-Letter staff<br />\nreplaced the author's original<br />\ntitles with those that are decent<br />\nand respectable. But \"Peacocks<br />\ngo Limp on Jays Friday Night\"?<br />\n\"Manly Gridmen refuse to kiss<br />\nsister\"?<br />\nI find these inappropriate, not<br />\njust for the subject matter but<br />\nespecially for the university<br />\nNews-Letter. I can only sympathize with the author, and I<br />\nbelieve whoever changed the<br />\noriginal titles without informing<br />\nthe author ahead of time should<br />\napologize to him. And if the<br />\nNews-Letter insists on having its<br />\nstaff title the articles, I sincerely<br />\nhope that good taste and decency<br />\nwill be taken into account from<br />\nnow on.<br />\n<br />\nthe sports section of the NewsLetter to make a mockery out of<br />\nthem each week. I find this to be<br />\nextremely unethical and I believe<br />\nthat all of us with stakes in this<br />\nmatter\u2014not just me, but the<br />\nNews-Letter staff, the football<br />\nteam, and the Hopkins community\u2014should give this matter<br />\nsome attention.<br />\n<br />\nSee BRUCE,8<br />\n<br />\netters<br />\n<br />\nWith Eyes Closed<br />\n<br />\nby James Rosen<br />\n<br />\nHiroko Takayanagi<br />\n<br />\nIfriecA; t4'i A tiCrEW<br />\nfC ME?

I wrote the<br />\nfootball articles in the two<br />\nSeptember issues of the NewsLetter. My own titles for my articles had been changed by the<br />\nSports Editors Danny Kofos and<br />\nChris Szeles and were replaced<br />\nby what I consider degrading<br />\nvulgarity which should have no<br />\nplace in the Hopkins News-Letter.<br />\nI was in the News-Letter office on<br />\nSunday evening to express my<br />\ndisapproval of Mr. Szeles' creations, \"Peacocks Go Limp on<br />\nJays Friday Night\" and \"Manly<br />\nGridmen Refuse to Kiss Sister.\"<br />\nThe comments made to me by<br />\nMr. Szeles that evening were just<br />\nas unprofessional as were his<br />\ntitles.<br />\nHe told me that his titles were<br />\nhis prerogative and that he found<br />\nthem creative. He then told me<br />\nthat I acted like a football player<br />\nwho had been hit in the head one<br />\ntoo many times and that I should<br />\nnot make such a big deal concerning the headlines, for the football team is only a Division III<br />\nteam which he would consider<br />\nlucky to have a record better than<br />\n.500. He then told me that if! am<br />\nstill not satisfied, that I should just<br />\nleave.<br />\nClearly Mr. Szeles does not<br />\nrespect the hard work that the<br />\nfootball team puts in every week.<br />\nIn fact, it appears that he is Using<br />\n<br />\nMichael J. Pocchia<br />\n<br />\nIllusions of grandeur<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to comment on the<br />\nlack of professionalism or rather,<br />\nthe incompetence of the NewsLetter Sports Editors: Danny<br />\nKofos and Chris Szeles.<br />\nAfter reading the headlines of<br />\nthe last two football articles:<br />\n\"Peacocks go limp on Jays.'<br />\nand \"Manly Gridmen Refuse to<br />\nKiss Sister\", both the brainchildren of Kofos and Szeles, one<br />\nmust wonder if their concentration is on sports or somewhere<br />\nelse, perhaps the gutter. Maybe<br />\ntheir pre-med status, which they<br />\nmention quite often in their column, has something to do with<br />\ntheir infatuation with puns involving the male body.<br />\nIt appears that it is the responsibility of the Sports Editors to<br />\ncreate the headlines for submitted<br />\narticles. Having read the original<br />\ncopy of last week's football article, I know the headline suggested by the writer was: \"Jays'<br />\n4th Quarter Risk Leaves Them<br />\nShort.\" Chris and Danny must<br />\nhave decided this to be an inappropriate headline and opted for<br />\n\"Manly -Gridmen,'\" 'having a<br />\nmuch more football related connotation as anyone can envision.<br />\nIt would only seem fair to let the<br />\nperson who wrote the article title it. Realistically, can he do a<br />\nworse job?<br />\nI would like to remind Danny<br />\nand Chris that though the NewsLetter may not be Pulitzer Prize<br />\nmaterial, there are those who take<br />\nwhat they are doing seriously and<br />\nare not working hard for a mere<br />\ntranscript<br />\nenhancement.<br />\nGentlemen, please quit these illusions of grandeur.

The Hopkins<br />\nBest Dressed Sale has grown in<br />\npopularity and in 1972 moved to<br />\nthe Evergreen House to accomodate growing crowds (and<br />\nhordes of thrifty Hopkins<br />\nstudents). Last year's sale raised<br />\nover $56,000 for the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital.<br />\n\"This year's money will be reentered into the Hopkins Hospital<br />\nCommittee.\" said Wagandt.<br />\nThese proceeds will benefit patient care.<br />\n<br />\nStudents write from Soviet Union<br />\nPerspectives, from Page 10<br />\nfessional family backgrounds.<br />\nMost parents want their<br />\nchildren to get an education at<br />\nleast as good as their own. To ensure this, many hire private tutors<br />\nfor their young ones.<br />\nThis is one of the main reasons<br />\nwhy the professionals' social<br />\nstratum largely reproduces itself.<br />\nAnother important reason is that<br />\nyoung people residing in the city<br />\nwhere the university or college is<br />\nsituated have better enrollment<br />\nopportunities than young people<br />\nliving in other cities, because of<br />\na shortage of dormitory facilities.<br />\nSome measures have already<br />\nbeen taken to bridge the opportunities gap. Industrial factories<br />\nsend some of their young workers<br />\nto college on scholarships higher<br />\nthan the ordinary state ones.<br />\nThere are also full-time<br />\npreparatory courses at institutions<br />\nof higher learning, with priority<br />\nadmissions going to young industrial workers and farmers.<br />\nGood progress at the course<br />\nmeans enrollment in the college<br />\nor university in question without<br />\nentrance exams.<br />\nThe Smena poll shoved that the<br />\nthree main requirements the<br />\nstudents want their future jobs to<br />\nmeet are to be morally satisfying<br />\n(77 percent of the polled), highly<br />\nuseful socially (52 percent) and<br />\nwell paid (52 percent).<br />\nParadoxically, only 2 in 100<br />\nmentioned \"the opportunity to<br />\nbecome a leader, a manager,\"<br />\neven though many of the polled<br />\nare school activists with leadership experience.<br />\nAnother alarming contradiction<br />\nrevealed by the poll is the gap between the above-mentioned three<br />\npriority requirements and the<br />\nstudents' ideas of their professional prospects. One can hardly<br />\nexpect people who are not<br />\nsatisfied with their job choice to<br />\nfind their future employment<br />\n\"morally satisfying.\" But only<br />\n64 in 100 said they would choose<br />\nthe same profession if they were<br />\nto choose again. The fact that so<br />\nmany were unhappy with their<br />\nselection is attributable to the<br />\n<br />\npoor idea the young people had<br />\nof their own abilities and of the<br />\nprofession they chose, and also to<br />\ntheir parents' erratic guidance.<br />\n(The poll showed that family<br />\nplayed a great role in career<br />\nchoice.)<br />\nMany of those polled noted<br />\nthey would prefer an occupation<br />\nwhich would yield better pay with<br />\nmany creative opportunities.<br />\nThe fact that professionals<br />\n(especially engineers) are paid<br />\ncomparatively little has caused a<br />\nfall in the prestige of higher<br />\neducation in this country in the<br />\npast few years, revealing itself in<br />\nthe swift decrease in applications<br />\nfor admission, especially at<br />\ntechnical colleges. The situation<br />\nshould change for, the better<br />\nbecause engineers' salaries will<br />\nsee an average 30 to 35 percent<br />\nrise in 1987, depending on individual performance and<br />\nqualification rating. (Grants for<br />\nhighly efficient workers will also<br />\nbe set up.)<br />\nStudents' intense interest in<br />\n<br />\ntheir future salaries seems to be<br />\npartly attributable to their inability to live on the 40 to 50 ruble<br />\nmonthly grant and to the resulting<br />\ndependence on their parents.<br />\n(Most students live with their<br />\nparents and usually get more<br />\nfrom the family budget than they<br />\ncontribute. Most of those living<br />\naway from home receive material<br />\nsupport from their families.)<br />\nA draft of higher and secondary<br />\nspecialized education reform provides for a rise in scholarships.<br />\nMaterial dependence on the family is not as harmless as it may<br />\nseem. The young eventually<br />\ndevelop the habit of dependency<br />\nand become unable to do any<br />\ndecision-making on their own or<br />\nact responsibly in the future.<br />\nThe students' high interest in<br />\ntheir future salary is indicative of<br />\ntheir desire to gain economic independence rather than an excessive love of money.<br />\nIn late 1986. Munira Nabiyeva,<br />\n<br />\na college student from Dushanbe<br />\n(the capital of Tajikistan, one of<br />\nthe 15 constituent republics of the<br />\nUSSR) proposed proclaiming the<br />\n39th parallel, Peace Belt.

The<br />\nwhole idea is to sell the person<br />\nright along with their wares.<br />\nIt does bother me, however,<br />\nwhen this \"image-selling\" begins<br />\nto find its way into the real world,<br />\nwhere, one would hope, substance is more important that image. In the political arena,<br />\nhowever, this doesn't seem to be<br />\nthe case. We have entered the age<br />\nof the \"image consultant,\" a<br />\nglorified press agent whose job is<br />\nto make sure that the candidate<br />\nappeals to the greatest Humber of<br />\npeople possible.

A good example<br />\nwould be Gary Hart, a basic<br />\nnobody congressman from the<br />\nMidwest who suddently became<br />\nthe strongest Democratic candidate for President, simply<br />\nbecause he projected the image of<br />\nbeing the new JFK. He had to<br />\nchange his name and age to do it;<br />\nbut he did. I wouldn't be surprised to see Gary Hart run\u2014being<br />\na womanizer just gives him that<br />\nmuch more credibility as being<br />\nlike JFK.<br />\nMore frightening than all this,<br />\n<br />\nhowever, is the image making<br />\nthat has surrounded Oliver North.<br />\nThere has been little real discussion of what Oliver North did or<br />\ndidn't do, but rather the media<br />\nhas chosen to focus on his image.<br />\nLife magazine ran a headline on<br />\nOliver North as 'a suburban dad.'<br />\nWell, I'm sure that quite a few<br />\ncriminals were fathers, but that<br />\nnever made much difference in<br />\nconsideration of their crimes.<br />\nNorth has basically been portrayed as a patriot, a good<br />\nAmerican who was only following orders, the fall guy for the<br />\nhigher ups.

His press agent<br />\n(lawyer, whoever) has done a<br />\ngood job on selling him, while<br />\n<br />\nkeeping the substance of his actions well hidden. The only real<br />\ndifference between the selling of<br />\nMichael Jackson and the selling<br />\nof Oliver North is that one is based on outrageousness, and the<br />\nother is based on the commonplace.

Grenville Jones and<br />\nJoe DalPorto consistently beat the<br />\nvisitors to the ball in an attempt<br />\nto generate some early offense.<br />\nJones's efforts finally paid off as<br />\nhe hustled to pick up a loose ball<br />\nwhich was deflected by the<br />\nHaverford goalie, but Jim<br />\nMcKiernan was right there to<br />\nboot the rebound into the open<br />\nnet. So at 3:26 of the first half,<br />\nHopkins held a 1-0 wad.<br />\nThe rest of the first half saw<br />\nHaverford beginning to control<br />\nthe ball, but they weren't able to<br />\ndo anything with it. The visitors<br />\nconsistently made poor passes<br />\nflying over the football goalposts<br />\nor simply out of bounds. It may<br />\nhave been a slight case of nervousness, but more likely, it was<br />\nthe harassing of the Blue Jay<br />\ndefense which gave Haverford<br />\ndifficulty.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins consistently hustled on<br />\ndefense, led by Staunton Golding<br />\nand Matt Lawrence. Lawrence, it<br />\nseemed, was always in the way<br />\nwhen Haverford mounted an offensive surge, and he helped<br />\nmake goalie Eric Shaw's life a lot<br />\neasier. The strong Hooter defense<br />\ncontinued into the second half, as<br />\nHaverford continued to control<br />\nthe ball. As the game progressed, it became increasingly obvious that the visitors were taken<br />\nout of thir game plan by the extremely physical Blue Jays.<br />\nHopkins players were issued four<br />\nyellow cards and a red card, and<br />\nwould have received far more if<br />\nthe referee had paid attention to<br />\nthe constant whining of the<br />\nHaverford players. Although the<br />\nHooters couldn't manage much<br />\noffense, they clearly had the<br />\nvisitors rattled.<br />\nAt 17:37 of the second half,<br />\nRob Shaker broke free in the<br />\nHopkins zone for Haverford. He<br />\ngot away with pushing off the<br />\ndefender, and tied the game by<br />\nbeating Shaw one-on-one. Shaw<br />\nremained under constant<br />\npressure, and it appeared that the<br />\nHopkins defense might finally be<br />\ngetting tired. However, a saving<br />\nheader by Craig Weinstein and a<br />\nbeautiful play by Eric Lindenbaum preserved the tie, and the<br />\nteams entered overtime with a<br />\nscore of 1-1.<br />\nHaverford dominated the overtime periods, but Eric Shaw rose<br />\nto the occasion. The senior goalie<br />\nmade four of five incredible saves<br />\n<br />\nto keep the score unchanged, and<br />\nafter two overtimes, the game<br />\nended in a 1-1 time with much of<br />\nthe crowd clamoring for a shootout.<br />\nSo, it would appear that many<br />\nquestions were left unanswered.<br />\nOr were they? Hopkins certainly<br />\nproved that they have fully<br />\nrecovered from their early season<br />\ndifficulties, and the defense was<br />\nsimply awesome. Coach John<br />\nHaus proved his ability to inspire<br />\na team, as his Blue Jays physically abused and out-hustled Haverford. Mostly, the Hooters reaffirmed that they are one of the<br />\nfinest teams in the MAC and in<br />\nthe Southern Region.<br />\nYork College became the unfortunate victim of any Hopkins<br />\nfrustration, as the Blue Jays<br />\ncrushed them in Pennsylvania by<br />\na score of 4-0. Four players accounted for all of the Hopkins<br />\nscoring in a rather neat fashion:<br />\nWarren Jones from Jim Roros,<br />\nGrenville Jones from Weinstein,<br />\nWeinstein from W. Jones, and<br />\nRoros from G. Jones. The<br />\ndefense chalked up their third<br />\nshutout of the season.<br />\nThe Hooters now boast a<br />\nrecord of 4-2-1. they travel to<br />\nUrsinus for a MAC game tomorrow, and then return home the<br />\nfollowing Saturday to face<br />\nDickinson at 10:45 in the morning. They will have to wait until<br />\nthe post season to face Haverford<br />\nagain, as the two teams are not<br />\nscheduled to meet again in the<br />\nregular season.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins women's<br />\ncrew begins its fall season with<br />\nthe largest team in Hopkins<br />\nhistory. Under coach Doug<br />\nSargent and team captain<br />\nCharlene Hu, twelve novices will<br />\njoin four varsity rowers to put<br />\nthree boats of women on the<br />\nwater.<br />\nAfter a victory in the Collegiate<br />\nCup regatta last spring, three<br />\nrowers are returning to row varsity this fall. Jeannine Ritchie,<br />\nHilary Kubista, and Kelly Kieffer all rowed in the women's<br />\nnovice boat last year. Ritchie and<br />\nKubista, at 5'6\", have shown<br />\npromising times on the<br />\nergometer, or rowing machine.<br />\nKieffer, a sophomore, previously ran cross country for Hopkins.<br />\nShe switched to rowing for the<br />\nspring season and currently remains with the crew.<br />\nThe women's novice shells<br />\ngive the team depth. Team captains Charlene Hu chose the<br />\ntwelve women from a field of 50<br />\npotential rowers on the basis of<br />\nheight, strength, and rowing<br />\ntechnique. The rowers form a<br />\nnovice 8-man and a novice 4-man<br />\nshell. One rower on the 8-man<br />\nshell, sophomore Micheline<br />\nTang, has rowed in college for<br />\none semester.

This year's AL West<br />\nchamps, the nucleus of which appeared on the scene at the same<br />\ntime as the infamous Metrodome,<br />\nare destined to lapse back into<br />\nmediocrity with little more than<br />\na flirtation with promise.<br />\nDon't get me wrong: personally, I appreciate the talents of<br />\nmany of their ballplayers. It's just<br />\nthat as ballclubs go, this one of<br />\nthe absolutely luckiest you're<br />\nbound to see for some time.<br />\nFor one thing, through Tuesday's games the Twins have been<br />\noutscored 778-775. Do you think<br />\nthat's important? I do. From 1869<br />\nuntil 1983 (excluding the 1981<br />\nstrike season) there were thirteen<br />\nchampionship teams that had<br />\nRuns/Opposition Runs ratios that<br />\nwere anywhere near as bad as the<br />\nTwins'. None of those thirteen<br />\nrepeated the following WA-son.<br />\nr \u2022 I<br />\n<br />\nSome of them failed quite<br />\ndramatically the next year (for example, the 1969 Braves finished<br />\n26 games out the next season, the<br />\n/<br />\n2 games out<br />\n1971 Giants fell 261<br />\nthe next year, and the 1964 Cardinals went from first to seventh<br />\nin just one season.)<br />\nI couldn't say that I know exactly how that happens, but there<br />\nare a couple of factors at work<br />\nhere. For one thing, one of the<br />\ncardinal rules of sports is that if<br />\nyou don't score more runs than<br />\nthe other guy, you lose.<br />\nConsidering that the Twins<br />\nhave so far posted an 85-73<br />\nrecord despite giving up nrre<br />\nruns than they scored, they have<br />\nthus proved themselves extremely lucky, and luck does not hold<br />\nup from season to season. For<br />\nanother, teams that win generally make fewer changes than other<br />\nteams, simply because they refuse<br />\nto recognize certain problems that<br />\nmust be overcome to remain<br />\ncompetitive.

Instead, researchers are examining such things as the differences<br />\namong women, the differences between men and women, and the conditions under which women become<br />\nnot victims, but perpetrators, of<br />\ndiscrimination and even violence.<br />\n\"Ten years ago, \"says Ms. Stinipson, \"the study of 'gender and sex<br />\nroles' was a code phrase for the study<br />\nof women that was dispassionate.\"<br />\nBut the field has come a long way,<br />\nshe argues: \"It has moved from the<br />\nstudy of a separate 'sex to the study<br /><br />\nof a social system.

It seems to me that<br />\nfeminist anthropology is far from being another adjectival anthropology.\"<br />\nPioneering work by feminist<br />\nscholars in anthropology and in<br />\nhistory has filtered through to other<br />\nfields as well, including classical<br />\nstudies.<br />\n\"Periods of great achievement and<br />\nprogress like Periclean Athens, the<br />\nAge of Augustus, the Renaissance,<br />\nthe French Revolution\u2014if you look<br />\nat these periods from the female point<br />\nof view, they take on a completely<br />\ndifferent aspect, \" says Gordon<br />\nWilliams, professor of Latin and<br />\nchairman of the classics department<br />\nat Yale University. \"That's had quite<br />\nair impact on Roman studies.\"<br />\nBlack studies are being similarly<br />\nchanged, in the view of Mr. Stewart<br />\nof Penn State.

Thcir interest,<br />\nMs. Stimpson notes, extends to both<br />\nhistory and theology.<br />\nSome scholars, in fact, think they<br />\nare beginning to see more attention<br />\nbeing paid to religion in fields outSide of religious studies\u2014especially<br />\nin literature, in the critical analysis<br />\nof sacred texts; and in history, where<br />\nreligion is increasingly seen as a potent force, for good or ill, in the lives<br />\nof many people.<br />\n\"It results, \" says Mr. Marty,<br />\n\"from the breakup of the confidence<br />\nthat the academy had that there was<br />\na single way to think about/the human<br />\ncondition and the future.

The<br />\nchairmen have worked hard to attend to two<br />\nconcerns: thoroughly addressing the topic<br />\nand enhancing the Symposium's reputation.<br />\nThe advantages of the latter are that it improves the Symposium for years to come<br />\nand generates prestige for undergraduate<br />\nstudies at Hopkins.<br />\nThis year, the chairmen, Salman Azhar<br />\nand Shaun Mitchell, have proved to be no<br />\nexception. For their topic, politics and the<br />\nmedia, they have found a balance in which<br />\nthey have drawn public 'big names' so as<br />\nto give the Symposium greater exposure<br />\nand have stayed within their budget in the<br />\nprocess. Equally important, it appears that<br />\nthey have managed this without sacrificing<br />\na fairly comprehensive look at the topic,<br />\nwhich is much to their credit.<br />\nThe arduous process of securing speakers<br />\nwas, as it is always, exacerbated by the confines of their allocated budget. The budget,<br />\nwhile nominally not insignificant, simply<br />\ndoes not even begin to cover the asking<br />\nprices for many public figures while working through normal agency channels.<br />\nThis is especially true for a topic for<br />\nwhich figures in both politics and the media<br />\nwould be recruited. Azhar and Mitchell<br />\nsnagged McFarlane and Will through<br />\nHopkins affiliations, though still at the expense of their entire allocation.<br />\nThe Symposium, however, is not without<br />\nits limitations. Because of its budget, there<br />\nare only four speakers total. Azhar and Mitchell are still searching for one more.<br />\nNevertheless, even if one is found, this<br /><br />\nspeaker's honorarium will have to financed by fund-raising, which so far has been<br />\nmost unsuccessful.<br />\nFour speakers will impart less information and fewer percpectives on the issue<br />\nthan it deserves. It is also unfortunate that<br />\nthe number of speakers was necessarily<br />\nfewer than the six of last year, and ten of<br />\nthe year before; three years ago, the symposium chairmen could only afford three<br />\nspeakers.<br />\nThat there are only four speakers places<br />\na special burden on the Symposium. It must<br />\ncontinue to offer as wide a breadth of opinion as possible\u2014and yet only four<br />\nspeakers will be contributing.<br />\nUnfortunate in this regard is that the two<br />\n'big name' speakers, McFarlane and Will,<br />\nare both conservatives. In the public eye,<br />\nthis conservative bias can detract from the<br />\nrespectability the Symposium chairmen<br />\nhave worked so hard to gain. It is important that future Symposia provide as much<br />\ndiversity as possible by seeing that all concerned interest groups are represented.<br />\nConsidering the rates of honoraria, simply throwing more money into the budget is<br />\nnot the only answer. There is no doubt,<br />\nhowever, that it would help.<br />\nIt would also help to select Symposia<br />\nchairmen ealier. This would provide the<br />\nchairmen with more time, and thus a better chance of approaching potential<br />\nspeakers before their schedules have filled.,<br />\nThe Symposium should continue to be a<br />\ndistinguished forum for topical discussion.<br />\nIts standards should not be lessened when<br />\nthis could be avoided by ample funding.<br /><br />\nCalling to Council<br />\nThis year's Student Council is getting off<br />\nto quite a slow start. Although a few different social programs are in the planning<br />\nstages, it appears that the Council's biggest<br />\nconcern lately has been their own attendance policy.<br />\nIt is no doubt critical for the Council to<br />\nhave solid, regular attendance at their<br />\nmeetings. As with any such organization,<br />\neach member contributes to the overall efficiency of the group. In addition, it is<br />\nnecessary to have a quorum for voting<br />\npurposes.<br />\nHowever, little else has been accomplished at these meetings so far this year. This<br />\nweek, Council President Scott FitzGerald<br />\nannounced that the Office of the Dean of<br />\nStudents has approved a \"Fall Festival\" to<br />\nbe held the weekend of Fall Break. An \"International Festival\", planned for early<br />\nNovember, was also discussed. Both are<br />\nsolid programs, but neither is anything<br />\nwe've never seen before.<br />\nIn a News-Letter interview last February,<br />\nFitzGerald said that it was his goal to focus<br />\nmore on social programming as well as<br />\ncommunity service in the Hopkins area. But<br />\nneither of these issues, beyond the Festival<br />\nplans, have yet been addressed in Council<br />\nmeetings.<br />\nLast year at this time Council had<br />\norganized a freshman forum which inform-<br /><br />\ned students about security at Homewood<br />\nand in the surrounding area. The issue of<br />\nsecurity resurfaced a number of times at last<br />\nyear's Council meetings: the group spent<br />\nmuch time discussing the problems with the<br />\nsecurity van service. Perhaps it was this<br />\nongoing debate which led to the University's purchase of a second escort van.<br />\nThe year's Council needs to address major issues such as this. Certainly there are<br />\nstill problems with security\u2014 much of the<br />\ncampus, for example, is inadequately lit.<br />\nCouncil also must come up with adequate<br />\nsocial programming for the semester. At<br />\nthis week's meeting, some members said<br />\nthat a number of fraternities are disobeying rules which prevent them from holding<br />\nparties during scheduled campus events.<br />\nFitzGerald suggested that Social Committee members should \"call the frats and tell<br />\nthem not to have a party.\" Perhaps a more<br />\nviable technique would be explicit coordinated efforts at programming between<br />\nuniversity-sponsored social committees and<br />\nfraternities.<br />\nThe Student Council has the potential to<br />\nbe a most influential campus group. Its<br />\nmembers should look beyond the prepara- \u2022<br />\ntion of attendance policies and begin to examine issues of importance for the entire<br />\ncampus.<br /><br />\nA Little Leeway<br />\nby A.

The Best Thing<br />\nAgainst Which To Do This is<br />\ncoincidentally the most likely the<br />\nthing to get you angry in the first<br />\nplace. This thing to which I am<br />\nreferring is not actually one unit,<br />\nbut they together can be taken as<br />\na whole. They are spread<br />\nthroughout campus, and are<br /><br />\nspreading further still, like a contagion. They have been the source<br />\nof more frustration to students,<br />\nfaculty, employees, and Post-doc<br />\nfellows alike than anything in<br />\nmemory.<br />\nI am speaking, of course, about<br />\nthe series of Seilers vending<br />\nmachines distributed around campus. How many times have you<br />\nscrounged around the library for<br />\ntwenty minutes, looking for someone to lend you a quarter so<br />\nyou can buy that needed soda, only to put your money in the<br />\nmachine and . . . surprise!! You<br /><br />\nwith anyone, had arrangements<br />\nwhich were agreeable to the author<br />\nof the article and the News-Letter<br />\nstaff been made ahead of time,<br />\nand had the News-Letter staff<br />\nreplaced the author's original<br />\ntitles with those that are decent<br />\nand respectable. But \"Peacocks<br />\ngo Limp on Jays Friday Night\"?<br />\n\"Manly Gridmen refuse to kiss<br />\nsister\"?<br />\nI find these inappropriate, not<br />\njust for the subject matter but<br />\nespecially for the university<br />\nNews-Letter. I can only sympathize with the author, and I<br />\nbelieve whoever changed the<br />\noriginal titles without informing<br />\nthe author ahead of time should<br />\napologize to him. And if the<br />\nNews-Letter insists on having its<br />\nstaff title the articles, I sincerely<br />\nhope that good taste and decency<br />\nwill be taken into account from<br />\nnow on.<br /><br />\nthe sports section of the NewsLetter to make a mockery out of<br />\nthem each week.

I wrote the<br />\nfootball articles in the two<br />\nSeptember issues of the NewsLetter. My own titles for my articles had been changed by the<br />\nSports Editors Danny Kofos and<br />\nChris Szeles and were replaced<br />\nby what I consider degrading<br />\nvulgarity which should have no<br />\nplace in the Hopkins News-Letter.<br />\nI was in the News-Letter office on<br />\nSunday evening to express my<br />\ndisapproval of Mr. Szeles' creations, \"Peacocks Go Limp on<br />\nJays Friday Night\" and \"Manly<br />\nGridmen Refuse to Kiss Sister.\"<br />\nThe comments made to me by<br />\nMr. Szeles that evening were just<br />\nas unprofessional as were his<br />\ntitles.<br />\nHe told me that his titles were<br />\nhis prerogative and that he found<br />\nthem creative. He then told me<br />\nthat I acted like a football player<br />\nwho had been hit in the head one<br />\ntoo many times and that I should<br />\nnot make such a big deal concerning the headlines, for the football team is only a Division III<br />\nteam which he would consider<br />\nlucky to have a record better than<br />\n.500. He then told me that if! am<br />\nstill not satisfied, that I should just<br />\nleave.<br />\nClearly Mr. Szeles does not<br />\nrespect the hard work that the<br />\nfootball team puts in every week.<br />\nIn fact, it appears that he is Using<br /><br />\nMichael J. Pocchia<br /><br />\nIllusions of grandeur<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to comment on the<br />\nlack of professionalism or rather,<br />\nthe incompetence of the NewsLetter Sports Editors: Danny<br />\nKofos and Chris Szeles.<br />\nAfter reading the headlines of<br />\nthe last two football articles:<br />\n\"Peacocks go limp on Jays.'<br />\nand \"Manly Gridmen Refuse to<br />\nKiss Sister\", both the brainchildren of Kofos and Szeles, one<br />\nmust wonder if their concentration is on sports or somewhere<br />\nelse, perhaps the gutter. Maybe<br />\ntheir pre-med status, which they<br />\nmention quite often in their column, has something to do with<br />\ntheir infatuation with puns involving the male body.<br />\nIt appears that it is the responsibility of the Sports Editors to<br />\ncreate the headlines for submitted<br />\narticles. Having read the original<br />\ncopy of last week's football article, I know the headline suggested by the writer was: \"Jays'<br />\n4th Quarter Risk Leaves Them<br />\nShort.\" Chris and Danny must<br />\nhave decided this to be an inappropriate headline and opted for<br />\n\"Manly -Gridmen,'\" 'having a<br />\nmuch more football related connotation as anyone can envision.<br />\nIt would only seem fair to let the<br />\nperson who wrote the article title it. Realistically, can he do a<br />\nworse job?<br />\nI would like to remind Danny<br />\nand Chris that though the NewsLetter may not be Pulitzer Prize<br />\nmaterial, there are those who take<br />\nwhat they are doing seriously and<br />\nare not working hard for a mere<br />\ntranscript<br />\nenhancement.<br />\nGentlemen, please quit these illusions of grandeur.

To ensure this, many hire private tutors<br />\nfor their young ones.<br />\nThis is one of the main reasons<br />\nwhy the professionals' social<br />\nstratum largely reproduces itself.<br />\nAnother important reason is that<br />\nyoung people residing in the city<br />\nwhere the university or college is<br />\nsituated have better enrollment<br />\nopportunities than young people<br />\nliving in other cities, because of<br />\na shortage of dormitory facilities.<br />\nSome measures have already<br />\nbeen taken to bridge the opportunities gap. Industrial factories<br />\nsend some of their young workers<br />\nto college on scholarships higher<br />\nthan the ordinary state ones.<br />\nThere are also full-time<br />\npreparatory courses at institutions<br />\nof higher learning, with priority<br />\nadmissions going to young industrial workers and farmers.<br />\nGood progress at the course<br />\nmeans enrollment in the college<br />\nor university in question without<br />\nentrance exams.<br />\nThe Smena poll shoved that the<br />\nthree main requirements the<br />\nstudents want their future jobs to<br />\nmeet are to be morally satisfying<br />\n(77 percent of the polled), highly<br />\nuseful socially (52 percent) and<br />\nwell paid (52 percent).<br />\nParadoxically, only 2 in 100<br />\nmentioned \"the opportunity to<br />\nbecome a leader, a manager,\"<br />\neven though many of the polled<br />\nare school activists with leadership experience.<br />\nAnother alarming contradiction<br />\nrevealed by the poll is the gap between the above-mentioned three<br />\npriority requirements and the<br />\nstudents' ideas of their professional prospects. One can hardly<br />\nexpect people who are not<br />\nsatisfied with their job choice to<br />\nfind their future employment<br />\n\"morally satisfying.\" But only<br />\n64 in 100 said they would choose<br />\nthe same profession if they were<br />\nto choose again. The fact that so<br />\nmany were unhappy with their<br />\nselection is attributable to the<br /><br />\npoor idea the young people had<br />\nof their own abilities and of the<br />\nprofession they chose, and also to<br />\ntheir parents' erratic guidance.<br />\n(The poll showed that family<br />\nplayed a great role in career<br />\nchoice.)<br />\nMany of those polled noted<br />\nthey would prefer an occupation<br />\nwhich would yield better pay with<br />\nmany creative opportunities.<br />\nThe fact that professionals<br />\n(especially engineers) are paid<br />\ncomparatively little has caused a<br />\nfall in the prestige of higher<br />\neducation in this country in the<br />\npast few years, revealing itself in<br />\nthe swift decrease in applications<br />\nfor admission, especially at<br />\ntechnical colleges. The situation<br />\nshould change for, the better<br />\nbecause engineers' salaries will<br />\nsee an average 30 to 35 percent<br />\nrise in 1987, depending on individual performance and<br />\nqualification rating. (Grants for<br />\nhighly efficient workers will also<br />\nbe set up.)<br />\nStudents' intense interest in<br /><br />\ntheir future salaries seems to be<br />\npartly attributable to their inability to live on the 40 to 50 ruble<br />\nmonthly grant and to the resulting<br />\ndependence on their parents.<br />\n(Most students live with their<br />\nparents and usually get more<br />\nfrom the family budget than they<br />\ncontribute. Most of those living<br />\naway from home receive material<br />\nsupport from their families.)<br />\nA draft of higher and secondary<br />\nspecialized education reform provides for a rise in scholarships.<br />\nMaterial dependence on the family is not as harmless as it may<br />\nseem. The young eventually<br />\ndevelop the habit of dependency<br />\nand become unable to do any<br />\ndecision-making on their own or<br />\nact responsibly in the future.<br />\nThe students' high interest in<br />\ntheir future salary is indicative of<br />\ntheir desire to gain economic independence rather than an excessive love of money.<br />\nIn late 1986. Munira Nabiyeva,<br /><br />\na college student from Dushanbe<br />\n(the capital of Tajikistan, one of<br />\nthe 15 constituent republics of the<br />\nUSSR) proposed proclaiming the<br />\n39th parallel, Peace Belt. Her<br />\nmessage was published in local<br />\nyouth papers, the Tajik-language<br />\nKomsomoli Tojikiston and the<br />\nRussian-language Komsomolets<br />\nTajikstana.<br />\nMunira, who studies at the Tajik Institute of Russian Language<br />\nand Literature, is keen on<br />\ngeography. The fact that<br />\nDushanbe and Washington<br />\n[D.C.] are practically on the same<br />\nlatitude gave her the idea of connecting them and all cities, towns<br />\nand villages situated along the<br />\n39th parallel (which, apart from<br />\nthe USSR and the US, runs<br />\nthrough Iran, Turkey, Greece,<br />\nItaly, Spain, Portugal, Japan,<br />\nKorea, and China), with an imaginary line, the Peace Belt.<br />\n\"I address you, the young,<br />\nwhy not run a Peace Belt around<br />\nthis planet'?

In<br />\nher plan, the young in the countries along the Peace Belt would<br />\ndedicatedly work for peace,<br />\nvividly manifesting the incompatibility of the arms race and the<br />\nlooming threat of global nuclear<br />\nwar with their aspiration. \"The<br />\nyoung are this planet's future, and<br />\nthey are entitled to being confident in the future,\" she notes.<br />\nMunira believes that the first<br />\nPeace Belt will be joined by more<br />\nand more similar belts. \"We<br />\nmust do it right away, we have no<br />\nlime to spare,\" she writes.<br />\nThe two newspapers' editorial<br />\noffices invited Tajikistan's young<br />\npeople to voice their opinion on<br />\nMunira Mabiyeva's proposal.<br />\nYoung people from foreign countries are also invited to voice<br />\ntheirs.

This is why<br />\nentertainers have press agents\u2014<br />\nto make sure that all these interesting little tid-bits get out to<br />\nthe public, who consume them<br />\nright along with the entertainer's<br />\nrecords, films, and so forth. The<br />\nwhole idea is to sell the person<br />\nright along with their wares.<br />\nIt does bother me, however,<br />\nwhen this \"image-selling\" begins<br />\nto find its way into the real world,<br />\nwhere, one would hope, substance is more important that image. In the political arena,<br />\nhowever, this doesn't seem to be<br />\nthe case. We have entered the age<br />\nof the \"image consultant,\" a<br />\nglorified press agent whose job is<br />\nto make sure that the candidate<br />\nappeals to the greatest Humber of<br />\npeople possible.

A good example<br />\nwould be Gary Hart, a basic<br />\nnobody congressman from the<br />\nMidwest who suddently became<br />\nthe strongest Democratic candidate for President, simply<br />\nbecause he projected the image of<br />\nbeing the new JFK. He had to<br />\nchange his name and age to do it;<br />\nbut he did. I wouldn't be surprised to see Gary Hart run\u2014being<br />\na womanizer just gives him that<br />\nmuch more credibility as being<br />\nlike JFK.<br />\nMore frightening than all this,<br /><br />\nhowever, is the image making<br />\nthat has surrounded Oliver North.<br />\nThere has been little real discussion of what Oliver North did or<br />\ndidn't do, but rather the media<br />\nhas chosen to focus on his image.<br />\nLife magazine ran a headline on<br />\nOliver North as 'a suburban dad.'<br />\nWell, I'm sure that quite a few<br />\ncriminals were fathers, but that<br />\nnever made much difference in<br />\nconsideration of their crimes.<br />\nNorth has basically been portrayed as a patriot, a good<br />\nAmerican who was only following orders, the fall guy for the<br />\nhigher ups.

His press agent<br />\n(lawyer, whoever) has done a<br />\ngood job on selling him, while<br /><br />\nkeeping the substance of his actions well hidden. The only real<br />\ndifference between the selling of<br />\nMichael Jackson and the selling<br />\nof Oliver North is that one is based on outrageousness, and the<br />\nother is based on the commonplace.

The winner<br />\nwould be in contcol in the MAC<br />\nand probaNy become one of the<br />\nfront-rUnners for a NCAA<br />\nSouthern Region Tournament<br />\nbid. For Hopkins, the game<br />\nwould provide a chance for them<br />\nto relieve early season woes and<br />\ndefeat a prominent team. Surely,<br />\nboth teams would hustle, fight,<br />\nand do everything they could for<br />\na victory.<br />\nThe Blue Jays set the pace early and were the first to light the<br />\nscoreboard. Grenville Jones and<br />\nJoe DalPorto consistently beat the<br />\nvisitors to the ball in an attempt<br />\nto generate some early offense.<br />\nJones's efforts finally paid off as<br />\nhe hustled to pick up a loose ball<br />\nwhich was deflected by the<br />\nHaverford goalie, but Jim<br />\nMcKiernan was right there to<br />\nboot the rebound into the open<br />\nnet. So at 3:26 of the first half,<br />\nHopkins held a 1-0 wad.<br />\nThe rest of the first half saw<br />\nHaverford beginning to control<br />\nthe ball, but they weren't able to<br />\ndo anything with it. The visitors<br />\nconsistently made poor passes<br />\nflying over the football goalposts<br />\nor simply out of bounds. It may<br />\nhave been a slight case of nervousness, but more likely, it was<br />\nthe harassing of the Blue Jay<br />\ndefense which gave Haverford<br />\ndifficulty.<br /><br />\nHopkins consistently hustled on<br />\ndefense, led by Staunton Golding<br />\nand Matt Lawrence. Lawrence, it<br />\nseemed, was always in the way<br />\nwhen Haverford mounted an offensive surge, and he helped<br />\nmake goalie Eric Shaw's life a lot<br />\neasier. The strong Hooter defense<br />\ncontinued into the second half, as<br />\nHaverford continued to control<br />\nthe ball. As the game progressed, it became increasingly obvious that the visitors were taken<br />\nout of thir game plan by the extremely physical Blue Jays.<br />\nHopkins players were issued four<br />\nyellow cards and a red card, and<br />\nwould have received far more if<br />\nthe referee had paid attention to<br />\nthe constant whining of the<br />\nHaverford players. Although the<br />\nHooters couldn't manage much<br />\noffense, they clearly had the<br />\nvisitors rattled.<br />\nAt 17:37 of the second half,<br />\nRob Shaker broke free in the<br />\nHopkins zone for Haverford. He<br />\ngot away with pushing off the<br />\ndefender, and tied the game by<br />\nbeating Shaw one-on-one. Shaw<br />\nremained under constant<br />\npressure, and it appeared that the<br />\nHopkins defense might finally be<br />\ngetting tired. However, a saving<br />\nheader by Craig Weinstein and a<br />\nbeautiful play by Eric Lindenbaum preserved the tie, and the<br />\nteams entered overtime with a<br />\nscore of 1-1.<br />\nHaverford dominated the overtime periods, but Eric Shaw rose<br />\nto the occasion. The senior goalie<br />\nmade four of five incredible saves<br /><br />\nto keep the score unchanged, and<br />\nafter two overtimes, the game<br />\nended in a 1-1 time with much of<br />\nthe crowd clamoring for a shootout.<br />\nSo, it would appear that many<br />\nquestions were left unanswered.<br />\nOr were they? Hopkins certainly<br />\nproved that they have fully<br />\nrecovered from their early season<br />\ndifficulties, and the defense was<br />\nsimply awesome. Coach John<br />\nHaus proved his ability to inspire<br />\na team, as his Blue Jays physically abused and out-hustled Haverford. Mostly, the Hooters reaffirmed that they are one of the<br />\nfinest teams in the MAC and in<br />\nthe Southern Region.<br />\nYork College became the unfortunate victim of any Hopkins<br />\nfrustration, as the Blue Jays<br />\ncrushed them in Pennsylvania by<br />\na score of 4-0. Four players accounted for all of the Hopkins<br />\nscoring in a rather neat fashion:<br />\nWarren Jones from Jim Roros,<br />\nGrenville Jones from Weinstein,<br />\nWeinstein from W. Jones, and<br />\nRoros from G. Jones. The<br />\ndefense chalked up their third<br />\nshutout of the season.<br />\nThe Hooters now boast a<br />\nrecord of 4-2-1. they travel to<br />\nUrsinus for a MAC game tomorrow, and then return home the<br />\nfollowing Saturday to face<br />\nDickinson at 10:45 in the morning. They will have to wait until<br />\nthe post season to face Haverford<br />\nagain, as the two teams are not<br />\nscheduled to meet again in the<br />\nregular season.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins women's<br />\ncrew begins its fall season with<br />\nthe largest team in Hopkins<br />\nhistory. Under coach Doug<br />\nSargent and team captain<br />\nCharlene Hu, twelve novices will<br />\njoin four varsity rowers to put<br />\nthree boats of women on the<br />\nwater.<br />\nAfter a victory in the Collegiate<br />\nCup regatta last spring, three<br />\nrowers are returning to row varsity this fall. Jeannine Ritchie,<br />\nHilary Kubista, and Kelly Kieffer all rowed in the women's<br />\nnovice boat last year.

This year's AL West<br />\nchamps, the nucleus of which appeared on the scene at the same<br />\ntime as the infamous Metrodome,<br />\nare destined to lapse back into<br />\nmediocrity with little more than<br />\na flirtation with promise.<br />\nDon't get me wrong: personally, I appreciate the talents of<br />\nmany of their ballplayers. It's just<br />\nthat as ballclubs go, this one of<br />\nthe absolutely luckiest you're<br />\nbound to see for some time.<br />\nFor one thing, through Tuesday's games the Twins have been<br />\noutscored 778-775. Do you think<br />\nthat's important? I do. From 1869<br />\nuntil 1983 (excluding the 1981<br />\nstrike season) there were thirteen<br />\nchampionship teams that had<br />\nRuns/Opposition Runs ratios that<br />\nwere anywhere near as bad as the<br />\nTwins'. None of those thirteen<br />\nrepeated the following WA-son.<br />\nr \u2022 I<br /><br />\nSome of them failed quite<br />\ndramatically the next year (for example, the 1969 Braves finished<br />\n26 games out the next season, the<br />\n/<br />\n2 games out<br />\n1971 Giants fell 261<br />\nthe next year, and the 1964 Cardinals went from first to seventh<br />\nin just one season.)<br />\nI couldn't say that I know exactly how that happens, but there<br />\nare a couple of factors at work<br />\nhere. For one thing, one of the<br />\ncardinal rules of sports is that if<br />\nyou don't score more runs than<br />\nthe other guy, you lose.<br />\nConsidering that the Twins<br />\nhave so far posted an 85-73<br />\nrecord despite giving up nrre<br />\nruns than they scored, they have<br />\nthus proved themselves extremely lucky, and luck does not hold<br />\nup from season to season. For<br />\nanother, teams that win generally make fewer changes than other<br />\nteams, simply because they refuse<br />\nto recognize certain problems that<br />\nmust be overcome to remain<br />\ncompetitive.
