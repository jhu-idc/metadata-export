Before 1900 the accepted<br />\nbelief was that \"the least apparent<br />\ngovernment is the best in the world\",<br />\nbut with a student political awakening came a patriotic resurgence.

From almost any point of view the change would represent an<br />\nimprovement. The sophomore class has been underrepresented and the seniors overstocked with automatic members.

A service can be<br />\nrendered, however, through<br />\nthe analysis of the platforms<br />\nwhich the candidates have set forth. To a large-portion of the campus, these are the sole means for judging the candidates. All three men: Butt, Thaler, newlyentered in the race, and Williams are juniors in good<br />\nstanding, with a sufficient number of activities to insure<br />\ntheir interest in campus life and doings.<br />\nThere is much in common in all three platforms,<br />\nthough the wording or terms are in certain cases carefully coached in generalities. All three men seem to<br />\nfavor the proposed amendment, revising representation<br />\non the Council. This seems most satisfactory from any<br />\nviewpoint. All three candidates further approve of<br />\nthe various measures passed this year, designed to<br />\nafford a closer student check on Council activity: open<br />\nmeetings, discussion, recall, referendum. This, too, is<br />\nas it should be.<br />\nThaler makes no mention of further extension of<br />\nstudent control over activities. Both Butt and Williams<br />\nspeak in favor of such an idea. These premises we<br />\ntake with a grain of salt. We're willing to bet our<br />\nbottom dollar that there'll be no further Council control. Finances, for one thing, are still a little beyond<br />\nthe Council's capabilities, and we doubt that Dean<br />\nBerry is particularly anxious to entrust activities any<br />\nfurther to student jurisdiction. This much can be deemphasized in all the platforms, if not entirely forgotten for this election at least. It looks good but<br />\ndoesn't mean anything.<br />\nButt and Thaler both exhibit a most commendable<br />\nattitude toward the Honor system. We presume that<br />\nWilliams feels much the same way, in view of his Commission work. Here is a problem which will take up a<br />\ngood deal of Council time next year. Butt and Williams may have a slight edge due to their acquaintance<br />\nwith the matter after two years of Commission membership. Too, needless to say, Williams stand for platforms from candidates is strictly in accord with our<br />\npoint of view.<br />\nWe are forced to consider both Williams' and<br />\nThaler's compulsory assembly planks as inconsequential: Williams because he makes no provision for<br />\ndealing with the assembly problem once compulsion is<br />\ndropped, and Thaler because the suggestion he makes<br />\nhas not stood up under testing in previous years.<br />\nNeither of the candidates has made a significant contribution toward solving the assembly problem.<br />\nButt and Thaler deal with the social aspect. The<br />\nquestion will seek some treatment next year, and, while<br />\nnot too important, should be reckoned with.

He is outstanding in<br />\nhis field. To many of his students he<br />\nwas not only a capable instructor,<br />\nbut also a stimulating personality<br />\nand an inspiring individual. Therefore, I feel that the administration<br />\nof the University should have made<br />\nevery possible effort to persuade Dr<br />\nMitchell to continue his valuable<br />\nwork at Johns Hopkins, even to the<br />\npoint of not accepting his resignation.

It was produced in France by Jean Renoir, and stars Eric von<br />\nStroheim, Pierre Fresnay, Jean Gabin and Dita Parlo.<br />\nGrand Illusion comes to Baltimore bearing the plaudits<br />\nof the nation's critics. The National Board of Review<br />\nseelcted it as \"The best film of the year 1938,\" and the<br />\nNew York film critics gave it the first prize as the \"best<br />\nforeign film of the year 1938.\"<br />\nGrand Illusion is a war story without war scenes. It<br />\nis a tale of human beings rather than of battles, and<br />\ndeals with the effect of war on the lives of the individuals engaged in it. It is a prison camp story of the war,<br />\nbased on director Jean Renior's own experiences. The<br />\ntheme concerns itself with the simple humanities that<br />\nare stronger than man-made wars; more enduring than<br />\nfrontiers.<br />\nThe story is an original one by Jean Renoir (who is a<br />\nson of the famous impressionist painter and was) adapted by the author and Charles Spaak. There are complete<br />\ndialogue titles in English. For its direction, Renoir received the Cross of the Legion of Honor from the French<br />\ngovernment. He is the only director in the world to be<br />\nthus honored.<br />\nGrand Illusion is a celluloid textbook that describes<br />\nthe history men live\u2014not the history that is described<br />\nby those who watch, criticize, or moralize. It does not,<br />\nexcept by reference, condemn warfare. It merely tells<br />\nabout it in terms of the human beings who die in it. We<br />\nhope for propaganda it carries will be remembered, if<br />\nanother kind of propaganda is tooted from a bugle to<br />\nmake men leave their brains as a deposit for a uniform.<br />\n\u2014J.

If we may be permitted to say so, it's none of the Council's business.<br />\nAs far as previous experience goes, only Butt has<br />\never held a previous Council membership.<br />\nWell, that's the whole story. But unless reason<br />\nprevails there'll be much moaning and tearing of hair<br />\nafter Tuesday. A cool consideration of just how<br />\nmuch of his platform each candidate may be expected<br />\nto effect is as necessary as the platform itself. This<br />\nis as much a part of every voter's duty as is voting<br />\nitself.<br />\nIncidentally, too many<br />\nseem to have lost sight of<br />\nthe fact that Monday marks<br />\nthe date for a vote on a constitutional amendment for<br />\nCouncil as well as on presidential aspirants.<br />\nThe amendment, providing for a reapportionment<br />\nof Council representation without increasing Council<br />\nsize, came as a reply to student sentiment. From almost any point of view the change would represent an<br />\nimprovement. The sophomore class has been underrepresented and the seniors overstocked with automatic members. Opening the field to two more contestants should further beneficially stimulate interest<br />\nin Council work.<br />\nWe sincerely hope that student opinion has not<br />\nchanged. The amendment should be passed, as a<br />\nnecessary and timely revision.<br /><br />\nAnd One<br />\nWord More<br /><br />\nRepresented for National Advertising by<br /><br />\nNATIONAL ADVERTISING SERVICE, INC.<br /><br />\n420 Madison Avenue; New York City, New York<br />\nFRIDAY, APRIL 21, 1939<br /><br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER is taking no definite stand for<br />\nany one of the candidates<br />\nfor the Council presidency<br />\nthis year. A service can be<br />\nrendered, however, through<br />\nthe analysis of the platforms<br />\nwhich the candidates have set forth. To a large-portion of the campus, these are the sole means for judging the candidates. All three men: Butt, Thaler, newlyentered in the race, and Williams are juniors in good<br />\nstanding, with a sufficient number of activities to insure<br />\ntheir interest in campus life and doings.<br />\nThere is much in common in all three platforms,<br />\nthough the wording or terms are in certain cases carefully coached in generalities. All three men seem to<br />\nfavor the proposed amendment, revising representation<br />\non the Council. This seems most satisfactory from any<br />\nviewpoint. All three candidates further approve of<br />\nthe various measures passed this year, designed to<br />\nafford a closer student check on Council activity: open<br />\nmeetings, discussion, recall, referendum. This, too, is<br />\nas it should be.<br />\nThaler makes no mention of further extension of<br />\nstudent control over activities. Both Butt and Williams<br />\nspeak in favor of such an idea. These premises we<br />\ntake with a grain of salt. We're willing to bet our<br />\nbottom dollar that there'll be no further Council control. Finances, for one thing, are still a little beyond<br />\nthe Council's capabilities, and we doubt that Dean<br />\nBerry is particularly anxious to entrust activities any<br />\nfurther to student jurisdiction. This much can be deemphasized in all the platforms, if not entirely forgotten for this election at least. It looks good but<br />\ndoesn't mean anything.<br />\nButt and Thaler both exhibit a most commendable<br />\nattitude toward the Honor system. We presume that<br />\nWilliams feels much the same way, in view of his Commission work. Here is a problem which will take up a<br />\ngood deal of Council time next year. Butt and Williams may have a slight edge due to their acquaintance<br />\nwith the matter after two years of Commission membership. Too, needless to say, Williams stand for platforms from candidates is strictly in accord with our<br />\npoint of view.<br />\nWe are forced to consider both Williams' and<br />\nThaler's compulsory assembly planks as inconsequential: Williams because he makes no provision for<br />\ndealing with the assembly problem once compulsion is<br />\ndropped, and Thaler because the suggestion he makes<br />\nhas not stood up under testing in previous years.<br />\nNeither of the candidates has made a significant contribution toward solving the assembly problem.<br />\nButt and Thaler deal with the social aspect. The<br />\nquestion will seek some treatment next year, and, while<br />\nnot too important, should be reckoned with. Either of<br />\nthe two men might have gained an edge here by stating<br />\nsome more concrete proposal. Suffice to say that both<br />\nrecognize the issue as such.<br />\nTwo of Thaler's proposals we deem superfluous.<br />\nThe athletic program had best be left to the AA Board,<br />\nwhose job it is, and to which it might well devote a<br />\nlittle more time. And the matter of better understanding between Council and publications (NEWS-LETTER)<br />\nis now taken care of by open meetings. Boosting Amen -<br /><br />\nButt,<br />\nThaler, or<br />\nWilliams<br /><br />\nIt might be in order, in1:identally, to toss a bouquet<br />\nage<br />\nor two this week to a short<br />\none man gang on the campus. We refer to Mr. Isadore Bernstein, whose efforts<br />\nire largely responsible for<br />\nthe postings of the policy statements in the post-office.<br />\nHiding behind the anonimity of \"box 66\", Bernstein, first through the Pep committee, and now largely<br />\nby individual effort, has been waging a hard, thankless<br />\nbattle for campus reform. An indefatigable worker, his<br />\nzeal may at times have led him astray, but his sincerity<br />\nhas never been questioned. Bernstein's record offers<br />\na challenge that others might well consider.<br /><br />\nP<br /><br />\nMr Bernstein<br /><br />\nThe swastika flyer at<br />\nLatrobe carried on tradition undauntedly at the<br />\nPeace strike yesterday, but<br />\nthe strike took on new<br />\nsignificance notwithstanding. The attention of the<br />\nslightly smaller-than-usual crowd seemed noteworthy.<br />\nStudents who did strike for peace were earnest in<br />\ntheir sentiments and sincere in their realization 'of<br />\nthe war problem as near and threatening.<br />\nWhen a nucleus of honest workers, however small,<br />\nare anxious and willing to devote attention and energy<br />\nto a discussion and to action regarding a problem so<br />\npressing, hope is indeed held out for a solution. Yesterday's strike was a success. More fight might have<br />\nbeen desirable, but it was still a success.

One of ,the primary functions of the governing<br />\nbody of a university is to secure men<br />\nwho are capable scholars and instructors for the professorial staff.<br />\nDr Mitchell certainly fits into this<br />\nclassification. He is outstanding in<br />\nhis field. To many of his students he<br />\nwas not only a capable instructor,<br />\nbut also a stimulating personality<br />\nand an inspiring individual. Therefore, I feel that the administration<br />\nof the University should have made<br />\nevery possible effort to persuade Dr<br />\nMitchell to continue his valuable<br />\nwork at Johns Hopkins, even to the<br />\npoint of not accepting his resignation.

The National Board of Review<br />\nseelcted it as \"The best film of the year 1938,\" and the<br />\nNew York film critics gave it the first prize as the \"best<br />\nforeign film of the year 1938.\"<br />\nGrand Illusion is a war story without war scenes. It<br />\nis a tale of human beings rather than of battles, and<br />\ndeals with the effect of war on the lives of the individuals engaged in it. It is a prison camp story of the war,<br />\nbased on director Jean Renior's own experiences. The<br />\ntheme concerns itself with the simple humanities that<br />\nare stronger than man-made wars; more enduring than<br />\nfrontiers.<br />\nThe story is an original one by Jean Renoir (who is a<br />\nson of the famous impressionist painter and was) adapted by the author and Charles Spaak. There are complete<br />\ndialogue titles in English. For its direction, Renoir received the Cross of the Legion of Honor from the French<br />\ngovernment.
