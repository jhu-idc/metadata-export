The<br />\nNational Defense funds require no interest returns on<br />\nthe loans during the student's years at school, the<br />\nfinancial director explained. After his education, the<br />\nstudent must pay a 3% simple interest for the next ten<br />\nyears.<br />\nHowever, the federal program contains some<br />\nloopholes. Kaufman said the program \"forgives\"<br />\nbetween 50-100% of the loans to teachers, the upper<br />\nbracket for those teaching in slum schools.<br />\nA second aid program to students is through the<br />\nGuaranteed Loan Program of the banking system. The<br />\nstate government guarantees the bank loan which<br />\nrequires interest payments by students during their<br />\neducation if their parents' income is over $15,000.<br />\nKaufman siad the faults of the bank loan system<br />\nlie \"in trying to run this program not as a commercial<br />\nenterprise.\" He believes that the student interest rate of<br />\n6% is inappropriate in today's tight moneymarket.<br />\nIncreasing the rate and tacking on a processing charge<br />\nwould encourage increased bank loans to students,<br />\nKaufman proposed.<br />\nA second major flaw in the present system, the<br />\nfinancial director stated, is its tendency to provide<br />\nmonies to families who earn a high income and ignore<br />\nthe students who desperately need the loans. Kaufman<br />\nproposed to \"eliminate families whose financial<br />\nstatement indicates they have no need for college aid\"<br />\nfrom the bank loans. When a loan is requested, the banks<br />\nusually contact the university to confirm the applicant's<br />\nfinancial statements.<br />\n<br />\nShort-Changed<br />\nLast month state Senator Victor L. Crawford<br />\nsought legislation which would require all banks holding<br />\nstate funds to provide, student loans.

Both the<br />\nposition of Levering Hall in the University structure and<br />\nDr. Wickwire's role in the university are in question.<br />\nThe controve4 again flared up<br />\nNEWS<br />\nafter Dr. Lincoln Gordon received a<br />\nletter supporting the position of<br />\nANALYSIS<br />\nLevering Hall. The letter stated that the<br />\nLevering organization should not be<br />\nunder the jurisdiction of Mr. Robert Bilgrave, Director<br />\nof Student Affairs. To do so, it argued, would threaten<br />\nthe present S. A. programs. The writer of the letter<br />\nprefered to remain anonymous.<br />\nIn his response, Dr. Gordon indicated that there<br />\nhas developed a great deal of misunderstanding about<br />\nthe Levering Hall controversy as well as the position of<br />\nthe Chaplain. Much of these difficulties arose, he<br />\ncontinued, from misconceptions concerning the status of<br />\nboth Levering Hall-before the January take-over of the<br />\nYMCA operation by the University-and the Chaplain's<br />\noffice at Homewood.<br />\nGordon stated further that there has been no<br />\nchange in the reporting procedure of the University<br />\nChaplain. He said that the Chaplain's responsibility had<br />\nalways been to the Dean of Arts and Sciences (presently<br />\nDr. Allyn Kimbal) through the Director of Student<br />\nAffairs. The post is presently held by Mr. Robert<br />\nBilgrave.<br />\nJames Archibald, President of the Student<br />\nAssociation, stated, on the other hand, that there has<br />\nnever been, there is not now nor should there ever be<br />\nsuch an administrative arrangement. \"It would stiffle<br />\nus,\" lie claimed.<br />\n<br />\nThe current status of the budget is that Robert<br />\nBilgrave, Director of the Office of Student Affairs, has<br />\nrecommended S54,000 and passed this proposal on to<br />\nDean Allyn Kimball of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nKimball is then to submit the report, with or without his<br />\nrecommendation, to President Gordon for consideration.<br />\nThe SA is currently spending between $58,000<br />\nand $59,000, and has asked for $67,000 for the coming<br />\nyear. If the S54,000 figure is approved, the SA would be<br />\nforced to forego expansion and cut back within its<br />\npresent programs. Said SA president Jim Archibald,<br />\n\"Unless the budget is passed in full, I'm really afraid<br />\nthere are going to be problems.\" He added that \"We are<br />\nhoping to bring as much pressure to bear as possible,:<br />\nwith the intention of assisting the administration to its<br />\ndecision.\"<br />\nPassarella, when questioned as to the course of<br />\naction of the SC if their resolution is ignored,<br />\nmaintained \"We will cross that bridge when we come to<br />\nit; I don't see any point in threatening anyone before a<br />\ndecision has been made.\" Archibald expressed hope that<br />\neven if only $54,000 is passed, \"the university will come<br />\nup with the rest somehow, in order to keep the SA one<br />\nof the most, if not the most,important organizations on<br />\ncampus.\"<br />\nThe controversy is grounded in the status of<br />\nLevering Hall and the Chaplain's office within the<br />\nUniversity, as well as the Levering Hall budget. Both<br />\nproblems arose as a result of a complex series of<br />\nnegotiations between the Baltimore YMCA and the<br />\nUniversity over the ownership of Levering Hall.<br />\n<br />\nThese discussions began during the final year of<br />\nDr. Eisenhower's administration. Disagreement over the<br />\nprice to be paid for the building had blocked the sale for<br />\na lengthy period of time; this was finally resolved by the<br />\nuse of a private appraiser. In the meantime, the budget<br />\ndifficulties of the SA began to grow.<br />\n<br />\nThe YMCA had refused to increase the Levering<br />\nbudget ever since 1967 because- it anticipated that the<br />\nUniversity would be taking over all of its operations. The<br />\nUniversity still treated Levering as a YMCA program and<br />\nconsequently continued its support at the same level as<br />\nwhen the YMCA supported it. It was during this period<br />\nthat Dr. Wickwire, Chaplain of the Homewood Carnpus\u2022<br />\nexceeded the budget for Levering Hall through<br />\nexpansion of its various programs.<br />\nDuring the early months of 1969, the confusion<br />\nincreased. The head of the Baltimore YMCA informed<br />\nDr. Wickwire that the University would take over the<br />\nLevering Budget as of January 1. Dr. Wickwire and the<br />\nLevering Board of Managers Claimed that this<br />\ninformation took them completely by surprise.<br />\n<br />\nIn a letter from Dean Kimball, the Board of<br />\nManagers were informed that the University had made<br />\nno such agreement with the YMCA and that there would<br />\nshortly be meetings to discuss the status and budget of<br />\nLevering in the interim between its transfer from the<br />\nYMCA to the University. For the next month confusion<br />\nreigned. The YMCA continued to claim that the<br />\nUniversity had agreed to take over the Levering budget.<br />\nThe Managers meanwhile pressed for meetings with the<br />\nHopkins Administration in order to clear up the status<br />\nand budget situation. Finally, on January 24th, Di.<br />\nPartridge announced that he had been in contact with<br />\nthe Baltimore Y. and that the University would assume<br />\nthe cost of the Levering budget as the Y had originallY<br />\nannounced.<br />\nTentative Solution<br />\nDuring this time, the Chaplain's Office and<br />\nLevering Hall were operating without a budget because<br />\nthey were under the control of neither the YMCA 11\u00b0I<br />\nthe University. Ultimately, a tentative solution was<br />\nachieved by having both the YMCA and the University<br />\npledge more money to Levering.<br />\n<br />\nContinued to Page 6<br />\n<br />\n' Coca Cola- and -Colt,- me registered trade eta.ks which tclenttly only the p,oduct of The Coca<br />\n<br />\nCola Cornoao,<br />\n<br />\nLOOKING FOR A SUBLET?<br />\nWANT TO SUBLET?<br />\nThe News-Letter will be running a special advertising column with<br />\n\"SUBLETS OFFERED\" and \"SUBLETS WANTED\" headings.<br />\nYou get up to 25 words for $1.50, payable in advance.

Here is where General George<br />\nWashington resigned his commission,<br />\nANALYSIS the Peaee of Paris was signed and the<br />\nConstitutional Convention was first<br />\ncalled.<br />\nAnd here is where Bill Number SB 461, creating<br />\nthe position of secretary to the Board of Elections of<br />\nWicomico County, was enacted March 28.<br />\nThe Main Attraction<br />\nMore bills were passed in the Senate that day, but<br />\nthe main attraction was still an \"indiscrete\" senator. The<br />\nHonorable Frank J. McCourt had returned the day<br />\nbefore under the TV's glare to represent his constituency<br />\nduring the five remaining days of this session after<br />\nabandoning almost a year ago his second Baltimore<br />\ndistrict and his country for the world. After a jet-set<br />\ntravel pace, he wound up in India a few months ago in<br />\nthe hands of a bearded guru, with a Hindu-wedded<br />\nSpouse and under the surveillance of the Sun's New<br />\nDelhi bureau and police.<br />\nWhen McCourt arrived back in the United States<br />\nearlier this month, as instructed by his guru, he was<br />\nimmediately arrested on a narcotics rap. Finally bailed<br />\nout, he used last month his long-neglected vote to<br />\nabstain, and thus defeat, the pin ball machine bill \"out<br />\nof respect for the Senate.\"<br />\nTo Higher Grounds<br />\nFrom the Governor's reception room on the<br />\nsecond floor (the legislature is on the first) Annapolis<br />\nunfolds in narrow streets radiating from the State House.<br />\nOvergrown buildings of another age fight below for a<br />\nPlace in the afternoon sun. A door, preserved from olden<br />\ntimes except for bullet-proof glass and an electronic<br />\nlocking device, separates the Governor's office from his<br />\nguests.<br />\nMarvin Mandel shows his 49 Years with a<br />\nt hickening frame and eyes embedded in dour,<br />\nnonconcentric circles. Born in Baltimore, Mandel went<br />\nthrough the city schools and was graduated from the<br />\ntiniversity of Maryland. 13 years later he entered the<br />\nH011se of Delegates after working in a law firm and<br />\nParticipating in Baltimore city politics.<br />\nThe Governor answers questions curtly inbetween<br />\nPe draws (he was awarded the \"Pipesmoker of the<br />\nYear\" award as 1969's \"national figure who best<br />\nexemplifies the manly art of pipesmoking\"). His voice is<br />\ndeep, hoarse, and, at times, threatening. His face is well<br />\nWorn and emotionless.<br />\nThe Interview<br />\nGovernor Mandel said he supports the 75-25<br />\nF'residential Primary Bill (75% of the delegates to the<br />\n<br />\nDemocratic National Convention elected by the people<br />\nand 25% picked by the state central committee). He<br />\nappeared unmoved by the fact that earlier that day<br />\nSenator George McGovern, chairman of the Democratic<br />\nCommission on Party Structure, told Maryland's<br />\nJudiciary Proceedings Committee that the 25% selected<br />\nby the central committee would be in \"technical<br />\nviolation of the mandate of the 1968 Convention.\" The<br />\nConvention rules adoped last August stipulate that all<br />\ndelegates should be elected the year of the convention,<br />\nMcGovern said. The Maryland central committee will be<br />\nelected in 1970. Mandel headed an all-Humphrey<br />\nMaryland delegation in the '68 Convention.<br />\n4 Million Talkers<br />\nConcerning recent student bids for more power at<br />\nthe University of Maryland, Mandel stated, \"The only<br />\nthing I can do is to advise the Regents. This I have done.<br />\nI have supported more student representation.\" In the<br />\nfollowing question, the Governor acknowledged his<br />\npower to appoint the Regents. Mandel was more<br />\nemphatic on another side of college life. He referred to<br />\nthe much-puclicized U. of M. magazine nudes as<br />\n\"disgusting.\" \"To see that filthy language in print. This<br />\nis not a question of freedom of the press, but of<br />\ndecency.\"<br />\n<br />\nMandel's Achievements<br />\nGovernor Marvin Mandel received practically<br />\neverything he sought at the close of Maryland's General<br />\nAssembly at midnight, March 28.<br />\nThe legislature enacted more than 600 bills,<br />\nincluding some new and expanded executive programs.<br />\nTo finance the cost of government next year, the<br />\nAssembly also passed the $1.34-billion Mandel budget,<br />\nand raised the state sales tax from 3 to 4%.<br />\nThe administration successfully pushed the<br />\nfollowing legislation:<br />\n\u2014Creation of treatment centers for drug addicts.<br />\n\u2014Establishment of a planning authority in low-cost<br />\nhousing.<br />\n--Strengthening the state's Human Relations<br />\nCommission by giving it greater power of investigation.<br />\n\u2014Authorization of a new group to coordinate<br />\ndevelopment of a Baltimore rapid transit system.<br />\n--Re-establishment of a Presidential primary<br />\nelection in Maryland and selection of 75% of party<br />\nconvention delegations by the voters.<br />\n\u2014Granting of overtime pay for state employees and<br />\nthe state police as well as increased pensions for retired<br />\nemployees.<br />\nConsidered Mandel's most important<br />\naccomplishment was the legislature's enactment of his<br />\nproposals for constitutional change. A number of<br />\nconstitutional amendments will go on a special ballot<br />\nnext November.<br />\nThe most explosive of the proposals will be the<br />\nseries completely revamping Maryland's court system<br />\nand adding uniform qualifications for judges. One of the<br />\nproposals provides circuit and appellate judges not be<br />\nelected as is present but confirmed by the state Senate<br />\nevery 15 years.<br />\n<br />\nJADE EAST<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENTS<br />\nGOOD HUMOUR needs part time<br />\nsalesman now -- and full time<br />\nsalesmen through the Summer.<br />\n<br />\nThe Governor circumvented the question of<br />\nterminating state financial aid to disruptive students by<br />\npleading innocent of knowledge that such talk has been<br />\nheard in the State House. \"That is just talk. I never listen<br />\nto talk. There are four million talkers around here.\"<br />\nReplying to HEW's order to five Maryland state<br />\ncolleges to desegregate the Governor said, \"We had<br />\nalready been working on the problem\" He, along with<br />\nthe college presidents, stated he was not informed of the<br />\nHEW statement until after its release to the press.<br />\nWhen asked how he will overcome the financial<br />\nheadache Agnew left in his wake, he said he'd \"take<br />\naspirin.\" He then proceeded to denounce this<br />\nreporter\u2014\"Do you have 6 hours to discuss this? What<br />\nwill I do? Now isn't that a stupid question?\"\u2014speaking in<br />\nthe bittersweet rage only a skilled politician can muster<br />\nwithout a smile.<br />\nMoney Is The Hang-Up<br />\nThe most pressing issue facing Maryland is money,<br />\nand the lack of it, Mandel emphasized in another<br />\nquestion\u2014this time it was answered\u2014on what he believes<br />\nare the most urgent needs of the state. \"The federal<br />\ngovernment must share some of the money it takes away<br />\nfrom the states through taxes...Our bond rate is now at<br />\n4.32% That is the highest in our history, and we have the<br />\nbest state credit rating...We spent $10 million last year<br />\non the Baltimore police and over $5 million this<br />\nyear...It's hard to give priorities. There are so many<br />\nthings we need. The most we now need is money.\" He<br />\nreceived $62 million of it that day. The House of<br />\nDelegates approved raising the sales tax 1% to 4%.<br />\nMeanwhile the General Assembly last Friday<br />\nratified another of Mandel's set of constitutional<br />\namendments. This one would allow the voters to decide<br />\nin November whether the Governor can pick judges to<br />\nMaryland's' court system thereby hopefully ending the<br />\npresent patronage of local judicial posts.<br />\nAids to the Governor said the 19-year-old voting<br />\namendment was scrubbed this year in ordernot to have<br />\nthe controversial voting issue interfere with the \u00b0thet<br />\nconsittutional reforms. Governor Mandel said in the<br />\ninterview that he would continue to press for a lowei<br />\nvoting age although he saw \"nothing magic\" about the<br />\nage 19. In 1954 as a freshman delegate he proposed a<br />\nstate voting age of 18.<br />\nThe Art of Politics<br />\nAnd in the late afternoon that Friday on the<br />\nHouse floor, delegates from Baltimore county's seconc<br />\ndistrict evoked \"neighborhood rights\" in regard to the<br />\nslot machine bill. They wanted to be excluded from the<br />\nslots, and asked their colleagues in vain \"to respect local<br />\nlocal courtesy.\" Just an hour before, the Governor hac<br />\nasked me what my major was, with his farewell<br />\nhandshake. \"Political science?

In Chicago<br />\n10,000 people marched through the downtown area despite strong<br />\nwinds, and occasional heckling along State Street.<br />\nEight hundred demonstrators marched from City Hall to<br />\nWyman Park in Baltimore in the largest demonstration this city has<br />\nseen since the march in support of the \"Catonsville 9\" last October.<br />\nThere was a minor outbreak of trouble as protestors gathered<br />\nin City Hall plaza for the start of the demonstration. Several youths<br />\nwith armbands from the National States' Rights party were led away<br />\nfrom the peace people by police when they started to shout \"We<br />\nwant dead reds\" and \"Commie\" at the demonstrators. No one was<br />\narrested.<br />\nThe marchers gathered around the Civil War monument in<br />\nWyman Park at the end of the march to listen to speakers and folk<br />\nmusic. They planted a pine tree to symbolize life and resistence to<br />\nwar. The protestors then attached a balloon to the arm of the statue<br />\nreading \"End the War.\"<br />\n<br />\nOn October 22 of last year, Kimbal, Bevan<br />\nBilgrave and the Board of Managers for Levering<br />\nhall came to a tentative agreement. Archibald's<br />\nunderstanding was that after October 22 the<br />\nLevering Hall programs were to be completely<br />\nrun by the Board of Managers,\"This was only to<br />\nformalize a condition which had previously<br />\nexisted,\" he said.<br />\n\"We heard nothing from the<br />\nAdministration and we felt that they accepted<br />\nthe minutes (of the meeting)\" said Archibald.<br />\n\"Wickwire was never expected to report to<br />\nBilgrave. You can talk to every damn member of<br />\nthe Board of Managers and they'll tell you the<br />\nsame thing, that's what was said!\"<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire admitted that the<br />\nsituation was very confused and that all<br />\nstatements on Leverings' position in the<br />\nUniversity conflicted. \"I just don't know.\"<br />\n<br />\nSUPPORT LEVERING<br />\nAs has been made clear over the past few issues, the<br />\nNews-Letter is quite concerned about Levering Hall's future status<br />\non campus.

Their report called for an<br />\nend to the mandatory dormitory residence for freshmen and the<br />\nsuspension of parietals.<br />\nThe question of mandatory residence last arose two years ago when<br />\nHopkins S.D.S. issued a study of the requirement and asked the<br />\nAdministration to abolish the rule. At that time, due to the S.D.S.'s<br />\ngeneral lack of influence, their report was completely ignored by<br />\nAdministrators and brushed off by the Student Council. We are<br />\nencouraged by the fact that this issue has been broached again, and this<br />\ntime, by an \"official\" group which cannot be easily ignored.<br />\nThere are a number of factors which the University claims would<br />\nmiliate against ending the dorm rule. At the time of the SDS report, then<br />\nDean of Homewood Schools, Dr. G. Wilson Shaffer pointed to an obvious<br />\nfactor \u2014 the financial loss which Hopkins would face if the number of<br />\nstudents living in the dorms drastically dropped. Another prickly point<br />\nConcerned the availability of off-campus housing and the difficulties<br />\nMuch would face incoming freshmen should they try to find an<br />\napartment upon entering Hopkins. There were a number of other<br />\narguments which we feel were less valid \u2014 the freshman's \"loss of a sense<br />\nof community,\" and the alleged problems of adjustment for new students.<br />\nAs to the present report, Mr. Bilgrave stated that even if the<br />\nrecommendations were adopted, implementation could not take place<br />\nntil 1971. This, of course, is perfectly understandable \u2014 a demand for<br />\nimmediate revision would be unreasonable considering the financial<br />\ncommittment which the University has made so far to dormitory housing.<br />\nHowever, \"understanding\" for the University's financial stake in the<br />\ndormitories can only be continued to a point. The University's planning<br />\nfor on-campus housing, as is obvious to anyone who has lived in the<br />\ndorms, verges on catastrophe. For those, like Mr. Bilgrave, who point out<br />\nthe dorm's social advantages, we counter with the poll of about 1/3 of<br />\ndormitory residents two years ago which demonstrated that the social<br />\nbenefits were heavily outweighed by the poor quality of life in the Alumni<br />\nMemorial Residences. The University, in its planning, made a number of<br />\ngrave mistakes, and it is only fair, when discussing possible abolition of<br />\n<br />\nWE OF THE AMERICA) PaEGATix riv<br />\nPARIS (A)(51-i TO RE66-r5R -1Rok)(-7<br />\nPROTEST WITH 1-(4)0( AGAIK)51 THE<br />\naNKDEOT OFFEIJSWE Svt\\JC01-1<br />\nVIENAM.<br />\n<br />\nFIRMER OFUSIVE ACTIOK) A6A(MST<br />\nOOR PETENSIVE ApVAK)CE MOPTH WILL<br />\nFPNOKE CEO-NM<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n\"Oh, General, how thoughtless of me! Of course I didn't mean that all<br />\nwar is a terrible thing!\"<br />\n<br />\nthe residence rule, that they must expect to pay for that error in any<br />\nfuture retrenchments.<br />\nAs to the availability of housing for freshmen who would want to<br />\nlive off-campus, we would suggest that the University eliminate this<br />\nproblem by establishing a service which would benefit upperclassmen as<br />\nwell as incoming students \u2014 a Student Housing Service. Such an institution<br />\nexists at other colleges and is considered an integral part of the<br />\nUniversity's services to its students.<br />\nThe more abstract arguments which enter against eliminating the<br />\ndorm rule \u2014 namely, adaption of freshmen to a new environment, and the<br />\n\"death blow\" to the campus community \u2014 are absurd. There never was a<br />\n\"Hopkins community,\" and unless the Administration is willing to build<br />\nan attractive student housing complex on the model of Yale or Harvard,<br />\nthere is no way, using material means, that true community will ever come<br />\ninto being. As to the problems of \"adaptation,\" we can only say that<br />\nthere are many sophomores,juniors and seniors who are no more mentally<br />\nqualified than freshmen to manage an off-campus life responsibly.<br />\nTo overcome any potential University guilt feelings over letting<br />\nfreshmen face the cruel world alone, should the rule be abolished, we<br />\nwould suggest the following plan:<br />\n\u2014 Entering freshmen who wished to live off-campus must have<br />\nparental permission in writing. Thus, the decision is thrown back to its<br />\nproper place \u2014 the student's family, and not the University.<br />\n\u2014 The freshman must demonstrate to the University that he has<br />\nalready found adequate living facilities.<br />\nAt best, the residence rule which currently exists is too inflexible. In<br />\nevery class, there is a small but substantial segment of students who find<br />\ndormitory-type life repugnant or unsuited to their needs and there is<br />\npresently no way, outside of lying to the University, to be released from<br />\nthe requirement. At worst, the rule represents an attitude of the<br />\nUniversity which is outrightly paternalistic \u2014 an attitude which the<br />\nAdministration claims not to have.<br />\nWe urge -Mr. Bilgrave and other key administrators to give careful<br />\nthought to the Joint Review Board Report.

Do<br />\nyou agree with Rennie Davis, who called it \"political<br />\nrepression4'? and if so, would you expand upon it.<br />\nDELLINGER: I think its political repression, all right,<br />\nbut I don't like to throw the term around too much,<br />\nbecause I think that the attempt really is to use symbolic<br />\nand focused. political repression in order .to have an<br />\neffect upon the Movement. The United States_ attempts<br />\nin its way to accomplish the same ends, the same<br />\nobjectives that more obviously repressive societies have<br />\naccomplished by a combination of co-optation and<br />\nrepression.<br />\nI think that the picking out of eight people from<br />\nChicago, and put that with the Spock-Coffin-Ferber<br />\ntrial, put that with the Oakland 7, which of course has<br />\nturned out to be an acquittal, and in particular you put<br />\nit together with the oppression of the Black Panther<br />\nParty, and I think that its an attempt to pick off a few<br />\npeople and to warn other people not to get out of line<br />\nbecause this kind of thing could be in store for them.<br />\nBut there is a difference between the stage that we<br />\nare in now and what I'd call full scale repression, which<br />\nat least for the white anti-war movement has not come<br />\nabout.<br />\nN-L: In your speech you said you saw signs of this full<br />\nscale repression coming on. What are those signs?<br />\nDELLINGER: I think that the government would find<br />\nitself unable to carry on the war very much longer<br />\nwithout launching such a full scale repression. That is<br />\nwhy it is probably going to be forced to end the war. I<br />\nthink that public opinion has been so aroused and .<br />\nsensitized by the war in Vietnam that it would be a very,<br />\ndifficult time for them to launch a full scale repression.<br />\nTo keep the proper perspective, I should have<br />\nmentioned before the Presidio defendants and other<br />\nGI's. I think that is where the kid gloves are taken off<br />\nand the real repression is taking place.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that more action will be taken<br />\nagainst the police in Chicago?<br />\nDELLINGER: The eight policemen are scapegoats, and I<br />\ndon't see any determination to change the system in<br />\nChicago. There are so many assumptions in a society like<br />\nours that it's terribly hard to really get at them. And one<br />\nof the assumptions is that there are criminals and there<br />\nare law-abiding people, and very few people probe to<br />\nWhat I think is the truth of the matter, that the law itself<br />\nis criminal. Law and order is another word for the status<br />\nquo, and the status quo today protects property above<br />\npeople. It keeps people in slum tenements and in jobs<br />\nand factories where they don't have control over their<br />\nlives, don't have creativity.<br />\nOne of the things that I learned from previous<br />\nindictments and times in jail is that prison really is filled<br />\nwith victims of our society. In my own conception you<br />\ncan't begin to get at the problem of the police until you<br />\nget at the problem of the jails, until you get at the<br />\nproblem of property. The police are innocent victims<br />\ntoo. Well, none of us are really innocent. Their job is to<br />\nprotect property and to preserve economic inequality,<br />\nthe vast differentials in wealth and power. That's their<br />\njob.<br />\nAnd whether they do it with clean hands and<br />\ngentile methods, as sometimes happens, particularly with<br />\nmiddle class people, or whether they do it with clubs<br />\nand Mace, as happens particularly in black communities<br />\nand happened to middle class people in Chicago at the<br />\nConvention, that is not a fundamental difference.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel that you will be convicted?<br />\nDELLINGER: It's a little speculative at this point, but I<br />\nguess that anybody who is going to court in Chicago,<br />\nhaving affronted and really humiliated Mayor Daley for<br />\na world-wide audience, and knowing how the courts of<br />\n-Chicago are controlled by the Daley machine, I guess he<br />\nhas to expect to be convicted.<br />\nAlso, we know that the indictments were held up<br />\nfor at least ten days while Nixon's lieutenants studied<br />\nthem, and apparently rephrased them and reformulated<br />\nthem. So it's quite clear that the combination of the<br />\nwounded bear of Richard Daley and the new image<br />\nRichard Nixon, who wants to preserve law and order and<br />\na consensus without solving any of the problems, that<br />\nthey have combined to frame the indictments.<br />\nOn the other hand, the law is so transparently<br />\nunconstitutional and repressive in itself, that there is a<br />\ngood chance that a conviction, if there is one, will be<br />\noverturned later. But I myself believe that the courts,<br />\nincluding the much praised and much attacked Supreme<br />\nCourt, basically :do not operate on eternal legal<br />\nprinciples of justice, but they do reflect the political<br />\n<br />\nclimate of the society of the time. It's speculative at this<br />\npoint to know what the political climate will be at the<br />\ntime that our case comes to the Supreme Court, if it<br />\ncome there. Perhaps the war will be over, perhaps we<br />\nwill be in some kind of temporarily tranquil period in<br />\nwhich there will be pressure for amnesty for war victims,<br />\npolitical prisoners, and so forth, and perhaps we will be<br />\npart of that, along with deserters and draft resisters and<br />\nothers.<br />\nOn the other hand, the basic problems that the<br />\nUnited States faces in the world may remain. There will<br />\ncontinue to be revolts and unwillingness on the part of<br />\nThird World people to accept American dominance and<br />\n<br />\nperhaps we can take the word conspiracy and give it<br />\ngood instead of bad overtones.<br />\nN-L: To shift to a more general topic. The New Left<br />\ntoday seems to agree more or less on what changes are<br />\nnecessary in American society and government, but<br />\ncannot agree on the tactics to use to implement these<br />\nchanges. Do you think that unity is ever possible?<br />\nDELLINGER: I never want unity at the expense of<br />\ndiversity. There has to be some combination of unity<br />\nand diversity, I think. A group of people who work<br />\ntogether politically, whether in one organization or in a<br />\ncoalition, or maybe a combination of the two, should<br />\nnever aim at being monolithic. One has to encourage<br />\n<br />\nBe<br />\nre<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\nbo<br />\nrec<br />\nth<br />\n<br />\nof<br />\nbo]<br />\nDAVID DELLINGER (center),flanked by co-conspirators Jerry Rubin (left) and Abbie Hoffman (right)<br />\n<br />\ncontrol. There are all kinds of areas where people have<br />\nbegun to realize the emptiness of the American way of<br />\nlife, and the injustice of it. So it may be a time of<br />\nturmoil and conflict when it comes to the Supreme<br />\nCourt, and a time when the Supreme Court will want to<br />\nuphold the convictions, and play that end of its<br />\nweaponry.<br />\nN-L: Would you explain why Nixon's approval of these<br />\nindictments was necessary.<br />\nDELLINGER: We know that it was necessary, and my<br />\ninterpretation of it would be that Nixon was coming in<br />\nobviously with a keen eye toward public relations, to his<br />\nown image, and to setting the tone of his administration.<br />\nThese first few months are very important.<br />\nThe indictments are under a section of the Civil<br />\nRights law of 1968. This to me is perhaps a minor<br />\nindication, but a valid one, of how legislation can be<br />\nperverted. Humane liberal instincts that people have, and<br />\nwhich they think they can express through laws, rather<br />\nthan revolutionary changes in themselves and society,<br />\nturn out to have these jokers in them. The people who<br />\ncontrol Congress and ultimately control both the<br />\nframing and the enforcement of the laws are not<br />\nhumanitarian and are not egalitarian.<br />\nN-L: You mentioned in your speech that you want the<br />\nspotlight focused upon the issues of your indictment,<br />\nrather upon the individuals or the individual case. Yet in<br />\nJerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman you have two rather<br />\nflamboyant partners.<br />\nDELLINGER: Actually, Jerry and Abbie are from New<br />\nYork; we're the only three indictees from there. So I've<br />\nhad quite a bit of chance to talk with them since the<br />\nindictments, as I did before, of course. They share the<br />\n'same conviction. Now that doesn't mean that they are<br />\ngoing to abandon their individual styles, any more than<br />\nI'm going to abandon mine. But they do feel that we<br />\nhave to wage a political defense which tries to organize_<br />\npeople around the issues, rather than around us.<br />\nThey happen to be very funny and dramatic<br />\nindividuals, and I'm sure that they will say and do things<br />\nwhich will emphasize their personalities. But they will<br />\nnonetheless be pointing in the direction of the<br />\nunderlying issues, which are everything from ending the<br />\nwar in Vietnam to solidarity with the black liberation<br />\nfighters to getting at the hypocrisy of educational and<br />\npolitical and economic system.<br />\nN-L: And you are calling yourselves the Conspiracy?<br />\nDELLINGER: Yes. This was a joint decision which<br />\nsymbolizes what I mean. Instead of calling it a defense<br />\ncommittee, which will try to get us off by legal<br />\ntechnicalities or what have you, we are saying that we do<br />\nwork together, we do work together to try to get rid of<br />\nwar, racism, and military and corporate power; to try to<br />\nput the individual, the human being, back into the<br />\ncenter of things; to try to establish a communitarian<br />\napproach to life and society.<br />\nSince we do believe in working together, and since<br />\nwe do believe in organized effort, and since we do<br />\nbelieve in the objectives we are working for, then<br />\n<br />\ndiversity as well as working together, and at its best that<br />\nwas a characteristic of the New Left which was verY<br />\nexciting.<br />\nIn the process of deepening its insights and<br />\nstruggling for new visions and analysing new areas, and<br />\nalso realizing that you couldn't just expose an evil and<br />\nthink there would be a moral revulsion and the problem<br />\nwould be solved, but in realizing that there was very<br />\nserious organizing and very serious sicrificing involved a<br />\nlot of people have tended to move away from diversity<br />\nand individualism. They think that there is a single<br />\ncorrect line, they want to find it and say \"our<br />\norganization has it\", and if it doesn't have it \"why can't<br />\nwe form a 'political party which will have the correct<br />\nsolution.\"<br />\nThere is a certain movement in the direction of a<br />\nkind of sterile unity, I think. I'm sure that given the<br />\nnature of the eight defendants in this case we wilUnever<br />\nachieve that kind of monolithic unity. But at this point<br />\nour strength is in the fact we have different<br />\ntemperments, different backgrounds, and in some areas<br />\neven different political interpretations. I don't want to<br />\npreserve diversity just for the sake of it, but as we unite<br />\non some things and make them central to our attitude,<br />\nthere will be new areas opening up in which we will have<br />\ndifferent patterns.<br />\nSo I am not at this point worried by the diversity.<br />\nIt can create some problems though. Particularly since<br />\nthe government, whatever its own contradictions are,<br />\nwill undoubtedly conduct a monolithic and<br />\ncomputerized attack on us. But that is one of the<br />\ndifferences between their life style and their life style.<br />\nAnd I would be very sorry if we presented some kind of<br />\nlowest common denominator approach to the thing.

MATHIAS<br />\nWe must understand that we are now living in an<br />\nage when increasing reliance on military force and the<br />\nPurchase of every new weapon may not contribute to<br />\nour , defense. Now, as never before, we must critically<br />\nexamine each and every suggestion on its merits, not<br />\nmerely because of the immense cost of today's weapons<br />\nsystems \u2014 cost which inevitably mean sacrificing some<br />\nother national goal. We must also be sure that the<br />\ndefenses we buy will indeed defend, and we must be sure<br />\nthat new defensive systems do not actually decrease our<br />\noverall security.<br />\n, Civilization that was millennia in the making can<br />\nne disintegrated in minutes. We have no shield that will<br />\nPermit us to survive a holocaust and still welcome the<br />\nInure. e<br />\nsecurity have been forced back upon a second line of<br />\nW: the deterrence of attack by any potential<br />\nggressor, through our ability to rain destruction on him<br />\nIn return inexorable retaliation.<br />\nWe have achieved this deterrence of nuclear attack<br />\nand deterrence of other threats to our vital interests<br />\nlnd those of our Allies \u2014 at significant cost. For 23 years<br />\nhwe have survived in the nuclear age and in that time we<br />\naye learned that our own security \u2014 the success of our<br />\nclwn deterrence \u2014 requires us to have concern for the<br />\neeurity of our adversay, the Soviet Union, as well.<br />\nMutual Confidence<br />\nL Over time, and after appalling risks during the<br />\nt rlin and Cuban crises, we and the Soviets have both<br />\ntealized that for deterrence to succeed, for nuclear war<br />\ni\u00b0 be prevented, we must both feel a mutual confidence<br />\n1')Ithat deterrent. In short, for one of us to have security,<br />\nteith of us must have it. This is an inescapable<br />\nie,quirement if we are both to live in a world free from<br />\n`ne active threat of nuclear war.<br />\n\u201e, This conclusion is supported by the hard realities<br />\nthe nuclear arms race which stand out in stark and<br />\noold relief.<br />\nPro First, there is nothing that we can presently do to<br />\nthe Soviet Union from being able to attack us<br />\ncnd destroy our nation beyond recognition or repair.<br />\nriclitinued superiority in numbers of nuclear arms will<br />\nseN help us evade this reality,just as the Soviets' present<br />\narch for nuclear 'parity' will bring them no new<br />\n,<br />\n'eurity.<br />\nth Second, nothing which the Russians do,now or in<br />\nforeseeable future will enable them to launch a<br />\nt'iclear attack on us, and prevent us from destroying<br />\ncoe\u201e111 in return. No anti-ballistic missile system yet<br />\nsceived, no new weapon in development by the<br />\ns'ets, will enable them to escape this reality.<br />\ntie Third, security and survival in the nuclear age<br />\nboP\u201eend on mutual ,deterrence and mutual safety.

Only by preserving it can<br />\npi.'\"ericans and Russians begin to approach the political<br />\n114\u00b0,blems that divide us; to reduce the importance of<br />\nritilear weapons in the world; to lessen the risks that a<br />\n'<br />\nc ear war will begin despite ourselves; and to live in a<br />\nd not continually held hostage to fear.<br />\nReinforce Deterence<br />\nwe. Thus one of the standards which we must use in<br />\nitiellgiling each proposed strategic weapons system,<br />\ntei ticding the Sentinel, is whether its deployment would'<br />\nsliir3licIrce mutual deterrence, or undermine it without<br />\nstituting any reliable alternative.<br />\nt The Sentinel system, when completed, would be<br />\nach.<br />\nhe nlost difficult and impressive engineering<br />\nteehleve me n t in history, requiring the skills and<br />\nwu'iniques developed to send men to the moon. It<br />\ntop\u201euld embody two different sets of advanced radar,<br />\ncomputers and, if fully deployed, two missile<br />\nthoLenis meeting standards of reliability higher than<br />\nse for our offensive missile systems like Polaris and<br />\nsyslitutemen. Unlike Apollo, Polaris and Minuteman, this<br />\nioe eni would have to be in readiness to respond yvith<br />\nsin redible precision, accuracy and reliability at every<br />\ngle moment for a decade or more.<br />\ntit4 American industry and science, given sufficient<br />\nforeiand money, could certainly meet the standards set<br />\nthe Sentinel system. But that is not enough. We must<br />\n\u00b0<br />\nthe ask whether these standards of performance<br />\nfacInselves will actually make this system effective in the<br />\n:<br />\ntv of any enemy's determined efforts to counter it.<br />\ndein if Sentinel work's, will it really provide us with<br />\nadde.nse against nuclear attack? Or will it only pose an<br />\nniOnal threat to the stability of mutual deterrence?<br />\nirlte Defending successfully against an attack with<br />\n41 r-c0ntinental ballistic missiles, therefore, will require<br />\nstaevel of performance by the Sentinel system that is<br />\ngering to contemplate. A single failure in the course<br />\nclead,<br />\na nuclear attack could leave millions of Americans<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\nFor several years we had thought of an ABM<br />\nsystem only as a defense against a pcssible attack by the<br />\nSoviet Union. The arguments against trying to defend<br />\nagainst such an attack were overwhelming then, and they<br />\nare overwhelming now. Quite simply, we know that no<br />\ndefense system yet conceived can .stop enough of the<br />\nmissiles launched against us to make such a prospect<br />\ntolerable. For each step that we might take to improve<br />\nour defenses, the Soviets could develop new ways of<br />\novercoming our new defenses. At the end of the spiral,<br />\nwe would be almost as vulnerable as before.<br />\nWisely, we decided not to proceed with missile<br />\ndefenses against the Soviet Union which would only<br />\nundermine each side's confidence in mutual deterrence.<br />\nToday we face a new and somewhat different<br />\nissue. During the next few years, China will probably<br />\ndevelop the ability to launch long-range missiles aimed at<br />\ntargets within the United States. By the mid-1970's we<br />\nmay face the prospect that China could attack us with a<br />\nnumber of ballistic missiles.<br />\nNo one can view this forecast with equanimity,<br />\nnor oppose whatever steps might be possible to protect<br />\nour nation against such an attack. But we must ask very<br />\ncarefully what the best way to do this would be.<br />\nWhen we evaluate the Sentinel syste i as a defense<br />\nagainst a Chinese attack, it is generally assumed that it<br />\nwould be effective only for a limited number of years,<br />\nwithin the decade from approximately the mid-seventies<br />\nto the mid-eighties.<br />\nAfter that \u2014 despite a current lage in Chinese<br />\nmissile development \u2014 improved Chinese offensive<br />\ncapabilities would goad us to rebuild, renew or replace<br />\n<br />\nSENATOR MATHIAS, speaking at Hopkins during _ last fall's<br />\ncampaign. Mathias states that we must find \"new ways to order<br />\nour relations\" with nations other than nuclear arms.<br />\n<br />\nthe system and could even make meaningful defense<br />\nimpossible.<br />\nThere are other risks involved in arming ourselves<br />\nwith even a limited form of defense against the Chinese.<br />\n.For one thing, technical uncertainties in trying to<br />\ns intercept incoming nuclear warheads are still<br />\n'considerable. We would never be sure of the<br />\n\u2022effectiveness of the Sentinel system \u2014 either as a total<br />\ndefense against China, or as a partial defense against the<br />\nSoviet Union \u2014 unless we undertook exhaustive tests of<br />\nthe full system. This would mean violating the limited<br />\ntest-ban treaty of 1963 by resuming full-scale testing of<br />\nnuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Such action would<br />\nbe irrevocable.<br />\nWe must also realize that projects like Sentinel,<br />\ndirected against the Chinese, will likely lead to greater<br />\nContinued to Page 10<br />\n<br />\n-Our American Heritage<br />\n<br />\n1 Easter Blessing: Calhoun Reborni<br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\n<br />\nSenator -Thomas Corwin of Ohio once said that<br />\n\"All the monuments of Earth are built over solemn<br />\nasses.\" This statement was doubtless influenced by the<br />\nfact that Senator Corwin wanted to be President, and<br />\ncame no closer to the Presidency than to the Papacy. He<br />\ndid not state an inviolable rule of history, since there has<br />\nbeen suitable recognition to such funloving spirits as<br />\nAbraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson and Fiorello<br />\nLaGuardia.<br />\nNevertheless, an overweening seriousness and the<br />\ntotal absence of humor may aid someone in being taken<br />\nseriously. This is partly indicated by Mr. Corwin's<br />\nbetter-known Senate colleague, John C. Calhoun.<br />\nMr. Calhoun received some approbation because,<br />\nwhile not a total abstainer, he did not drink alcohol to<br />\nexcess. A suitably gentlemanly Southerner such as<br />\nJefferson Davis could become inebriated on an early visit<br />\nto Washington, but Mr. Calhoun never relaxed himself to<br />\nthis extent.<br />\n\"Glorious Health\"<br />\nIt was also noted that Mr. Calhoun's extensive<br />\nwritings and speeches are as deadly serious as those of<br />\nJohn Stuart Mill. This is not to say that he never<br />\nemployed ridicule. On March 4, 1850, he said that the<br />\ncry of \"Union, Union, glorious Union!\" would no more<br />\nsave the Union than the cry of \"Health, health, glorious<br />\nhealth!\" on the part of a physician could save a<br />\ndangerously ill patient.<br />\nIn spite of this, Mr. Calhoun appears devoid of the<br />\nself-deprecating humor of Mr. Lincoln. There is no<br />\ndoubt of his wholly serious concept of himself.<br />\nIt is conceded that Mr. Calhoun was an unusually<br />\ncreative student of government. Political science studies<br />\nare often an extensive statement of what is; Mr. Calhoun<br />\nmoved beyond this point to formulate proposals for<br />\nradical changes. That all his changes were designed to<br />\nstrengthen the slave states at the expense of the Federal<br />\ngovernment definitely suggests that Mr. Calhoun was<br />\nmore a sectional politician than a disinterested scholar.<br />\nNevertheless, it might be interesting to consider two of<br />\nMr. Calhoun's more suggestive proposals.<br />\nAgainst The Tariff<br />\nThe best known, contained in the South Carolina<br />\nExposition and Protest of 1832, was ghostwritten by Mr.<br />\nCalhoun and presented as a report of a committee of the<br />\nstate legislature. Here Mr. Calhoun indicated that the<br />\nsame percentage of states that amends the Constitution<br />\nshould be required to approve Federal legislation; that is,<br />\nMr. Calhoun was not in agreement with the current<br />\ntarrif, and he theorized that if one-quarter of the states<br />\njoined in opposition to a Federal law, it could be<br />\ninvalidated.<br />\nAt the time the slave states and free states were<br />\ne ual in number so it w<br />\n<br />\nCalhoun to summon half of the predominantly<br />\nagricultural slave states in opposition to a protective<br />\ntariff. Mr. Calhoun purported to demonstrate that all the<br />\nstates were sovereign commonwealths, that they had not<br />\nsurrendered their sovereignty upon joining the Union,<br />\nand that they therefore could exercise sovereignty.<br />\nUnlike Lucius Q.C. Lamar at a later time, he drew<br />\nno distinction between the thirteen original states, which<br />\ndid predate the Union, and later states, which had never<br />\nexisted as sovereign commonwealths outside the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nSelf-Contained Liquidation<br />\nActually, the states sacrificed a great deal of<br />\nsovereignty upon joining the Union, including the power<br />\nto declare war, issue currency, maintain Post Offices,<br />\nestablish tariffs in interstate or international commerce,<br />\n' and some others.<br />\nBeyond this, Mr. Calhoun believed that the<br />\nExposition's theory, that South Carolina could establish<br />\nitself as an independent republic if coerced to respect<br />\nFederal laws, was in accord' with the spirit of the<br />\nConstitution. Thus we are asked to believe that the<br />\nConstitution contains the seeds of its own liquidation;<br />\nthat it is, in the words of President Jackson, \"an airy<br />\nnothing,a bubble\" that must burst when criticized. It is<br />\ndifficult to believe that those who sought \"a more<br />\nperfect Union\" thought it would be more perfect if<br />\ncongenitally ephemeral.<br />\nAnother interesting theory was formulated by Mr.<br />\nCalhoun's last great Senate speech, read by Senator<br />\nMason of Virginia for an ailing Calhoun on March 4,<br />\n1850. Here Mr. Calhoun suggested a division of the<br />\nFederal Executive between one man from each section.<br />\nHe suggested that one might handle domestic matters<br />\nand the second might handle foreign affairs, but that the<br />\nimportant point was to have each section represented in<br />\nthe Executive branch.<br />\nSolid South Unprotected<br />\nOnce again, Mr. Calhoun's learned political<br />\ndiscourse has a sectional purpose. He wanted to insure<br />\nthat an equal official would be on hand to act as a check<br />\nagainst a pro-Northern President. Since the North had<br />\npulled ahead in popular and electoral votes, and<br />\nconceivably could control future Presidential elections,<br />\nMr. Calhoun felt that only extraordinary measures could<br />\nprotect Southern interests. Indeed his fears would be<br />\njustified by the election of 1860, in which a nearly Solid<br />\nNorth outvoted a nearly Solid South.<br />\nIn moral terms, Mr. Calhoun's declaration that<br />\n\"slavery is a positive good\" may appear abhorrent.<br />\nHowever, Mr. Calhoun definitely held his own when<br />\ndebating his position. In 1832, and again during the Civil<br />\nWar, a radical states' rights doctrine was overturned only<br />\nb Federal threats or a.

There are serious diplomatic and<br />\ndomestic problems, as well. To begin with, it has been<br />\nargued that Sentinel will increase the Russians' incentive<br />\nto talk about arms control, covering a comprehensive list<br />\nof offensive and defensive systems. I believe that these<br />\ntalks should take place, but I am not convinced that<br />\nSentinel will help us in bargaining with the Russians on<br />\nthese delicate and crucial matters. To the contrary, past<br />\nexperience \u2014 as with the bomber and missile gaps \u2014<br />\nindicates that any step, however, minor, taken to upset<br />\nthe strategic balance will only decrease the chances for<br />\nmeaningful discussions.<br />\nDuring the past few years, strategic stability has..<br />\npermitted a certain relaxation of tensions in our<br />\nrelations with the Soviet Union. I do not suggest that<br />\nour real conflicts of interest have been resolved, or that<br />\nthey will be resolved in the near future. But we have had<br />\na period of relative relaxation, and have taken the first<br />\ntentative steps back from the nuclear abyss \u2014 with the<br />\nlimited test-ban treaty. The hot-line between Washington<br />\nand Moscow, and our mutual efforts to prevent the<br />\nspread of nuclear weapons. But if we lose our present<br />\nconfidence in strategic stability and mutual deterrence,<br />\nwe will invite a new period of disagreement with the<br />\nSoviet Union even on matters of crucial importance to<br />\nus both \u2014 including issues affecting the prospects for<br />\nnuclear war.<br />\nFurthermore, beginning talks with the Soviet<br />\nUnion on an end to the arms race, as well as forswearing<br />\nnew strategic nuclear programs, may be the price of<br />\npreventing the spread of nuclear weapons to many<br />\nnations not now possessing them. Several counties have<br />\nalready declared that their support for the<br />\nnon-proliferation treaty is conditional on a show of<br />\nself-restraint by the Soviet Union and the United States.<br />\nThese diplomatic factors, as well as reasons of<br />\nstrategy, argue against deployment of the Sentinel<br />\nsystem at this time. Thereis also its high cost. I have said<br />\nthat cost must be no object where the security of the<br />\nUnited States is at stake. But where a program, such as<br />\nSentinel and its varients, is of unproven merit \u2014 and may<br />\nactually be of real harm \u2014 we must look at the economic<br />\nfactor.<br />\nWe are now facing grave problems in this country,<br />\nwith urgent demands for money to combat poverty,<br />\ncurb crime, and meet the crises of blight in our cities. We<br />\nneed to invest our resources in those things which will<br />\nmost enrich and enhance our lives and those of our<br />\n<br />\nContinued from Page 9<br />\n<br />\nChinese isolation and undermine our efforts to bring<br />\nChina into the international community.<br />\nBut there is a far graver risk. For in the process of<br />\nbuilding defenses against Chinese missile attack \u2014<br />\ndefenses of limited value \u2014 we would run the risk of<br />\nconfusing our strategic relations with the Soviet Union.<br />\nCurrent debate makes it clear that, strategically,<br />\ndiplomatically and psychologically, it is almost<br />\nimpossible for us \u2014 or the rest of the world \u2014 to<br />\ndistinguish with perfect clarity between an ABM system<br />\non guard against Red China and one focused on the<br />\nSoviet Union. Obviously, any Sentinel system designed<br />\nto counter a Chinese attack could also be used to<br />\nintercept some of the Russian missiles that could be<br />\nlaunched against us. As we improved the Sentinel to<br />\ncope with more sophisticated Chinese missile<br />\ncapabilities, we could raise growing doubts in Moscow<br />\nboth about our own intentions and about the stability of<br />\nmutual deterrence.<br />\nThe possibilities for misunderstanding by Moscow<br />\nare already vast. They will be multiplied if we proceed<br />\nwith deployment of even the most limited ABM system.<br />\nAnd the risk of such a misunderstanding is one which,in<br />\nmy judgment, we can ill afford.<br />\nThere is serious concern in the United States that<br />\nthe Soviet Union does not share our caution; after all,<br />\nthey and not we have initiated the construction of<br />\nanti-ballistic missiles. But we must examine closely just<br />\nwhat the Russians have been doing. In the first place,<br />\ntheir ABM system is a limited one,providing protection<br />\nonly for one city, Moscow. Second, their system is far<br />\nless sophisticated than the Sentinel would be, and<br />\nconsequently more subject to counter-measures. Third,<br />\nthe Russians themselves appear to have recognized the<br />\nweaknesses of their ABM system, just as we are<br />\nrecognizing the potential weaknesses of our own<br />\nproposals. In fact, they have slowed or stopped work on<br />\nthe defensive system deployed around Moscow.<br />\nI do not argue that we should rely on the Soviet<br />\nUnion's good faith. No rational security policy can be<br />\nbased on anything but the strongest, surest efforts to<br />\nprovide for our own security. But we can test the<br />\nRussians' restraint, at relatively little cost to ourselves.<br />\nWe can, to begin with, continue to equip our leaders<br />\nwith the most sophisticated of intelligence-gathering<br />\ndevices, including \"spy-in-the-sky\" satellites, so that we<br />\nwill know at any moment the status of offensive and<br />\ndefensive missile deployment in the Soviet Union and, of<br />\ncourse, in China.<br />\n<br />\nneighbors. But if we spend billions of dollars on sha<br />\nsystems which we may not need, We will have less for<br />\nthose challenges of urgent priority. Unless we are<br />\ncareful, the inertia of government spending \u2014 that<br />\ncreeping condition against which we in Congress wage,'<br />\ncontinual but often unavailing struggle \u2014 will set in an<br />\ncarry the Sentinel's costs beyond our control. If we are<br />\nto prevent this inertia from taking command, we must<br />\nexert ourselves now.<br />\nFinally, there is a fundamental problem, th,e<br />\nquestion of our attitudes concerning the role of forcell!<br />\nsecurity, and the role of weapons in the conduct 01<br />\ndiplomacy. For many years I have been concerned bY,<br />\nwhat I believe is our tendency to look at problems ot<br />\nmilitary policy without considering the related questions<br />\nof diplomacy and the securing of peace through political<br />\nmeans. We must not delude ourselves: in the long run,'<br />\nwe must deal with our adversaries on political an'<br />\nhuman levels as well as on the military plane. We can n\u00b0<br />\nlonger hide beyond the oceans, nor will we be able 10<br />\nhide behind a screen of missile defenses which do not<br />\nwork.<br />\nFortunately, we have learned some lessons in efirtil<br />\ndealings with our chief adversary, the Soviet Union.<br />\nhave had modest successes in making the world a safe!,<br />\n)lace, and in exercising a mutual caution and rrlutt?wA<br />\ntrust. As a result, the specter of nuclear war has recedeu<br />\na little way farther from us. We must not lose the chance<br />\nto carry on with these developments, including talks<br />\nwith the Soviet Union to end the nuclear arms race.<br />\nFor all these reasons, I reaffirm the conclusil<br />\nthat I formed and acted upon last year as a member \u00b0<br />\nthe other body. On the basis of all of the informati\u00b0,111<br />\navailable to me, it is still my view that a limited All<br />\nsystem should not be deployed at this time.<br />\nIn the longer run, we must continue our search f\u00b0I<br />\nnew ways to order our relations with other nations;<br />\nways that'do not depend upon the power of nueltead<br />\nweapons to deter, nor require the piling up of urinal,<br />\nweapons systems. Peace will be won by men, not,<br />\nmissiles or machines. It will be achieved by a Pat'e\"d<br />\nprocess of political effort, not by the unconsidere<br />\npurchase of new,complex military hardware.<br />\nWe must never neglect the hard demands of \u00b0Iiti<br />\n3e<br />\nown sure defense. But we must also not lose W11,<br />\nchances we have to lessen the uncertainities of<br />\nnuclear age, and advance the search for lasting peace.<br />\n<br />\nGEORGE WEIN Presents. the 16th Annual<br />\n<br />\nNEWPORT jAkii USTIVIL<br />\nJuly 3 thru July 6, 1969<br />\nAt Festival Field \u2022 Newport, Rhode Island<br />\nFour Evening Concerts \u2014 Thursday: For the Jazz Aficionado \u2014 Willie<br />\nBobo, Kenny Burrell, Bill Evans/Jeremy Steig, Young-Holt Unlimited,<br />\nFreddie Hubbard, Sonny Murray, Anita O'Day, Sun Ra, and others.<br />\nFriday: An Evening of Jazz-Rock \u2014 Jeff Beck, Blood, Sweat and Tears,<br />\nRoland Kirk, Steve Marcus, Ten Years After, Jethro Tull; and others.<br />\nSaturday: Dave Brubeck/Gerry Mulligan, Woody Herman, Sly and the<br />\nFamily Stone, 0.

The<br />\norganizers had brought together 100,00, the Police<br />\nhandled 20,000, and the Press reported 50,000. Believe<br />\nthe lie of your choice, had you been there the numbers<br />\nwouldn't have mattered. The war ended today. It had<br />\nbeen a long war to end the war, and the mass illusion<br />\nwas that peace was won. There were no questions left<br />\nfor the demonstrators, Vietnam was left to claim the<br />\nlives and loyalties of a diminishing number of blind<br />\nfanatics. The Pentagon and friends waft a stench that<br />\ndwarfs the rest of America's pollution\u2014the opinion was<br />\nunanimous. The world looked good in April's pouring<br />\nrain as you went deaft and blind with the word \"Peace\".<br />\nEaster Sunday\u2014it just happened here. There had<br />\nbeen that flurry, and then the grand blitzkreig of<br />\nmediocrity. There was a hole on at 9 o'clock, CBS. The<br />\nSmothers Brothers Cancellation Hour. The hell with the<br />\nquality of the show. That's as irrelevant as the official<br />\nreason for the cancellation. The show wasn't important?<br />\nCan't you see! The Cancellation is victory of an all<br />\npervasive deadening coercion. There is somebody in this<br />\ncountry who dares to tell you what it is proper for you<br />\nto see. Can't you see! You can't see. You are being<br />\nkicked in the teeth. For censorship isn't a ruling, isn't a.<br />\ndecision or a law.<br />\nCensorship is a principle, the idea that somebody<br />\nknows better. Censorship is not a passing manifestation<br />\nof authoritarianism. It lies at the very core of the<br />\nuniversal ideology of human belittlement. To control a<br />\nhuman being's perceptual intake is to smother his will,<br />\nhis intelligence, his individuality, everything that defines<br />\nhim as a man. To acquiesce in the suppression of one<br />\nidea is to renounce 10,000 years of human expression,<br />\nor was it only 5000, the 1960's, or perhaps only that<br />\nhour on television that wasn't. More magic numbers.<br />\nDeath is Living<br />\nAnd it isn't a matter of force. If there were only a<br />\nN4ayor Daley, only the blatant pigs, only the army, only<br />\nthe State Department and the blood-lust military<br />\nContractors, if it were only these killers and their dupes<br />\nthere would not be ten minutes standing between<br />\nhumanity and its fulfillment.<br />\nIf there were only bigotry, only hate, only the<br />\ninire of tradition's shackles, only religion, the agent of<br />\ninter-generational coersion, there would still be a better<br />\nthan fighting chance. The Movement is wrong; death is<br />\nmore. Death is propriety, death is acceptance, death is<br />\nliving the \"right sort of life.\"<br />\nThe polarization then is not between left and<br />\nright, new and old, conformists and the defiant. The<br />\nPolarization is between life and death. Life can accept all<br />\nexpression, death cannot. Censorship is a death wish, a<br />\ndesire to close the eyes and not...<br />\nMore. Life has.as its purpose the propagation of<br />\nlife. To accept that purpose is to be in harmony with a<br />\nuniversal law, the law being that each force, each true<br />\nentity exists only to propagate itself.' Death propagates<br />\nOnly death, albeit death disguised as sacrifice. To die for<br />\nanything, anything at all, is ultimately to die for death<br />\nitself.<br />\nAnd more. Life demands no justification other<br />\n<br />\nthan itself. Life lures more life with raw life. Death lures<br />\ndeath with purposes and crusades, twisted arguments<br />\nthat come out nowere but death.<br />\nStill more. Death waits, life does not.<br />\nMonday\u2014and what else is there to say? You can't<br />\nwin converts to this kind of thing. You either side with<br />\nlife or death. You either accept life as the purposeless<br />\npropagation of itself, and rejoice in your acceptance, or<br />\nyou follow one of the excuses of death. You fight to be<br />\nalive, you fight to experience all that you can grasp.<br />\nDeath is repugnant because it wastes your time. Death's<br />\nrules, death's inhibititions, death's causes and crusades<br />\nstand between the human being and his inalienable right<br />\nto perception.<br />\nToday is a standoff, modeled along the lines of<br />\nKennan's containment principles. The lesson of the '60's<br />\nis that the forces of life must organize to counter the<br />\nforces of death. Civil rights groups built fortresses<br />\nagainst racism, peace groups fight the draft, even public<br />\nschool kids in New York have had to organize to defend<br />\nthemselves against impingements on their school<br />\nvacations.<br />\nNot Afraid To Live<br />\nLife, banding together has stalemated death and<br />\nnow death will begin to turn on itself. Television will eat<br />\nitself up in a frenzy of paranoid self-censorship until no<br />\nshow can compete with the interest generated by a test<br />\npattern. The great crusades will end in a thousand<br />\nDienbienphues, and the leaders of the crusades will<br />\nconsume themselves in witch-hunting. (life is organized,<br />\nit will refuse to testify in the post-Vietnam Red Scare,<br />\nleaving only the militarists as sacrificial lambs). ln short,<br />\nthere is a core of desire in this country forming an<br />\nimpregnable nexus of life. The percentage, of course, is<br />\nsmall\u2014for mediocrity finds its definition in numbers: But<br />\nfor every 1000 taxi cabs with American flag stickers,<br />\nthere may be one soul not afraid to live for his country.<br />\nFor every 30,000 latter-day Hitler Youth at a \"Decency<br />\nRally\" there is an artist whose ideas can never be<br />\nbanished. For every parents' drive against sex education,<br />\nthere are two people who learn. These are the secrets of<br />\nthe magic numbers.<br />\nTuesday\u2014weather in Baltimore phenomenal.

The highlight of the<br />\nfestivities will be a mass affirmation of the ancient and<br />\nhonorable Nordic code that brought so much happiness<br />\nto the late, great Kraut himself. The code, as translated<br />\nby Youth for :Decency involves attesting to love of<br />\nplanet, love of country; love of parents, love of God and<br />\nreverence for one's own sexuality.<br />\nEntertainment at the birthday rally will include<br />\nsuch groups as the Joe Pyne Tabernacle Choir, the<br />\nDaughters of the War Department Marching Band, Jim<br />\nand 'civil<br />\nrights' and 'integration' before<br />\nit, 'hunger' is a slippery, vague,<br />\nopen-ended word, loaded with<br />\nemotional impact.

APRIL 11, 1969<br />\n<br />\nDistrict Judge Attacks Congressional CO.Ruling<br />\n(CPS)\u2014The ruling last week by a Federal<br />\nJudge that the Selective Service Act<br />\n\"unconstitutionally discriminates\" against<br />\nnon-religious conscientious objectors sets the<br />\nstage for a review of the 1967 draft law by the<br />\nU.S. Supreme Court.<br />\nIf the high court upholds the decision by U.S.<br />\nDistrict Judge Charles E. Wyzanski, atheists, agnostics<br />\nand others religious or not\u2014would be entitled to<br />\nexemption from the draft if they oppose war for<br />\nprofound moral reasons.<br />\nObjection to war must now be based on \"religious<br />\ntraining and belief.\" The Supreme Court in 1965 offered<br />\na broad definition of that term, but Congress, in 1967,<br />\naltered the law to exclude non-religious C.O.'s.<br />\nSo the issue now returns to the high court, if the<br />\nJustice Department decides to appeal the Wyzanski<br />\ndeicision. The prosecutor for the case said he would<br />\nrecommend an appeal, but Justice officials in<br />\nWashington say they won't decide on further action<br />\nuntil the case is reviewed within the next thirty days.<br />\nHarvard Grad<br />\nThe case will come to be known as the Sisson, 22,<br />\nwho had been convicted for refusing induction into the<br />\narmed forces. Sisson, a Harvard graduate and former<br />\nPeace Corps volunteer, had sought a C.O. deferment<br />\nuntil he learned the narrow religious restriction.<br />\nTechnically, his conviction was not overturned.<br />\nJudge Wyzanski merely issued an arrest in judgement,<br />\nstarying the sentence and allowing for a quicker appeal.<br />\nSisson could have been fined $10,000 and sentenced to<br />\nrive years in prison.<br />\nIn his 21-page opinion, the judge commented: \"In<br />\nthe draft act, Congress unconstitutionally discriminated<br />\n, against atheists, agnostics, and men, like Sisson, who,<br />\nwhether they be religiously motivated or not, are<br />\nmotivated in their objection to the draft by profound<br />\nmoral beliefs which constitute the central convictions of<br />\ntheir beings.\"<br />\nThe decision said that, in the absence of a direct<br />\nthreat to national survival, an individual's conscience can<br />\ntake precedence over the authority of the state. An<br />\n<br />\nindividual's conscience is recognized as being on a par<br />\nwith traditional concepts of religion.<br />\n\"Selective\" Objection<br />\n\"Selective\" conscientious objection is also upheld<br />\nin the ruling. The judge disposed of the charge that<br />\n\u00b0objections to one war but not others would open a<br />\n, floodgate of spurious claims for exemption. At the heart<br />\n. of the matter is an individual's sincerity, which can be<br />\njudged in the courts, the judge said.<br />\nThe ruling said the 1967 draft act violated the<br />\nprovision of the first amendment prohibiting laws<br />\ni\"respecting an establishment of religion.\" It called the<br />\n'Sisson case \"a clash between law and morality,\" and<br />\nwarned that ',when the state, through its laws, seeks to<br />\noverride reasonable moral commitments, it makes a<br />\n<br />\ndangerously uncharacteristic choice. The law grows from<br />\nthe deposits of morality.\"<br />\n\"When the law treats a reasonable, conscientious<br />\nact as a crime, it subverts its own power. It invited civil<br />\ndisobedience,\" the decision continued.<br />\nA similar case is now pending before the Supreme<br />\nCourt. A Los Angeles computer engineer who contends<br />\nthe C.O. provision was applied improperly to him is<br />\n'waiting to see if the high court\u2022will hear his appeal. A<br />\n'Federal district judge in Baltimore ruled in early<br />\nDecember that an atheist who believes killing is an<br />\nunendurable sin can qualify for a C.O. exemption.

An overwhelming 86% responded that<br />\nthe university has a responsibility to provide<br />\n\"non-academic facilities.\" 90% felt that a university<br />\nshould have \"a sense of community.\" The concensus felt<br />\nthat inter-level communication on campus is<br />\n\"unsatisfactory.\" \"Education is a joint effort by the<br />\nentire academic community. It pervades into every<br />\naspect of an individuals life and is dependent upon<br />\nintercommunication.

A center, where students and<br />\nfaculty can informally get together was indicated as a<br />\nmajor step in this direction. 62% of the respondents<br />\nwrote in of the need for a student union, even though no<br />\nmention of a student union was made on the<br />\nquestionaire. Many asked fora place for social gatherings<br />\n<br />\non campus. Others wanted somewhere to go to get<br />\nbetter acquainted with fellow students. 23% specifically<br />\nwrote of the \"inadequate service\" at the snack bar, and<br />\nits lack of feasability as a \"gathering place.\" Other<br />\nrequests included a student operated theatre hall, more<br />\nand better concerts, more frequent servicing of the<br />\nvending machines, especially in the dorms, increased<br />\nlaundry facilities, and more gym lockers.<br />\nMaking Plans<br />\nThe CISF has made plans and initiated action on<br />\nthe points raised in the questionnaire. The Hopkins<br />\nadministration is already reported to be considering for<br />\ninclusion in the budget the CISF-DSRC proposal to<br />\ncompletely renovate the snack bar area. Also included in<br />\nthe University's plans are increased parking facilities, and<br />\nan application to HUD for funds to purchase additional<br />\nundergraduate housing.<br />\nSaid one CISF spokesman, \"These programs are<br />\nnot sufficient.

Yet, he comes!<br />\nfrom a very sports-minded family.<br />\nHis father is athletic director at<br />\nthe Seaford Long Island High<br />\nSchool where Jim captained the<br />\nfootball, basketball and baseball<br />\nteams his senior year. From his<br />\nbroad-based education, he has<br />\nalways considered coaching -as a<br />\ncareer. For the past two years<br />\nafter his graduation from Rutgers,<br />\nhe has coached the Rutger's<br />\nfreshman team to a 20-11 record.<br />\nThe record is deceiving of this<br />\nman's knowledge and teaching<br />\nability of the game.<br />\n<br />\nAftido<br />\n<br />\nCOACH VALVANO<br />\nAt Rutgers under Coach Bill Foster's tutelage,<br />\nValvano\u2014co-captain of the 1967 quintet which finished third in the<br />\nNIT\u2014learned that the purpose of the freshman team was to develop<br />\ntalent for the varsity and not just to win ball games. The success of<br />\nthe varsity and the basketball program, in general, at Rutgers is<br />\ntestimony to this.<br />\nValvano Visits Campus<br />\nOn March 28th, Coach Valvano was on campus to talk to the<br />\nbasketball players and the coaches in the athletic department. I had<br />\na few moments to talk to him about his basic basketball philosophy.<br />\nAlthough he does not favor such methods as the Army slow-down<br />\ntechnique of defensive basketball, Valvano affirms that he is a<br />\ndefensively oriented coach.\"You can have an off-night offensively,<br />\nbut you never should on defense.\"<br />\nA strong advocate of man-to-man defense, Coach Valvano<br />\nbelieves in \"basic basketball with variety\" such as the \"monster\"<br />\ndefense lie used at Rutgers. This ia a combination man-to-man and<br />\nzone defense. Nevertheless, Valvano realized that he has to get to<br />\nknow his personnel before he makes definite plans or predictions. He<br />\nis out to do his best and we hope that not only the players but also<br />\nthe fans will support him and his team whole-heartedly.<br />\nAbout recruiting, Coach Valvano recognized that the<br />\nUniversity sets the tone and that his job is first to sell the academics<br />\nto prospective scholar-athletes and number two the basketball<br />\nprogram at Hopkins. He is looking for the scholar-athlete at all<br />\ntimes. His contacts in New Jersey and on the Island should supply<br />\nthe necessary talent to build a winner.<br />\nIn the conclusion of my interview, I asked him about his<br />\nphilosophy of player- coach relations. He said that he'd been very<br />\nfortunate in having a close relationship with his coach Bill Foster at<br />\nRutgers. He hopes that the same kind of rapport can be continued at<br />\nHopkins. From the few minutes, I don't see how he can fail in this<br />\nregard.<br />\nViewed By Past Mentor<br />\nIn the eyes of his former coach\u2014Bill Foster\u2014he has<br />\n\"tremendous potential\". Although young, he has better knowledge<br />\nof the game than anyone else the Hop could find. In the words of<br />\nMarshall Turner, \"We've selected the appropriate person to give<br />\nbasketball a new look at Hopkins.\" Mr. Turner mentioned Valvano's<br />\nenthusiasm and potential before adding that he was impressed with<br />\nCoach Valvano's approach to physical education and student<br />\nrelations. \"He's done a good job of recruiting and getting along with<br />\nthe students at Rutgers.\" To reenforce Turner's praise, \"Coach<br />\nValvano is a real diamond in the rough.\"<br />\nWe applaud Valvano's selection as head basketball coach to<br />\nreplace the resigning Henry Ciccerone. It is our hope that the<br />\nHopkins athletic situation will improve sO that like other young,<br />\noutstanding coaches in the past, Coach Valvano will not feel<br />\ncompelled to seek greener pastures. Although it is a wild fantasy at<br />\npresent, maybe someday Coach Valvano will be able to return to the<br />\nNIT as mentor of the Blue Jay Varsity. Along with Coach Valvano,<br />\nwe look forward to the future basketball successes at Hopkins under<br />\nhis energetic, youthful guidance.<br />\n<br />\nWarming up for their confrontation<br />\nwith an undefeated Virginia, the Hopkins<br />\nBlue Jays beat their three vacation<br />\nopponents with relative ease. For only the<br />\nsecond time in the last twenty-nine years,<br />\nbut for the second time in the last three,<br />\nthe Hopkins Stickmen stunned Mt.<br />\nWashington's once feared Wolfpack by a<br />\nscore of 10-4.<br />\nThe Wolfpack's Gene Fusting opened the<br />\nscoring on an assist from former Hopkins great<br />\nLucky Mallonee at 3:22 of the first quarter.<br />\nHowever, a goal by All-American Joe Cowan at<br />\n6:46 of the same quarter knotted the score and<br />\nthereafter the Jays were in control. The Blue<br />\nJays sprung into the lead on Stu Kahl's first goal<br />\nwith an assist by Cowan while three more goals<br />\nby Big Tuna Latson, the incomparable Cowan,<br />\nand speedster Charlie Coker more than offset an<br />\nadditional clinger by the Mounties to set the half<br />\ntime score at 5-2. From this point on, it was a<br />\nquestion of how badly the Jays would beat their<br />\nformer nemesis with Stu Kahl netting two more<br />\ngoals, Phil Buck a beautiful score on. a broken<br />\nclear, Cowan slipping the ball past a brilliant<br />\nBrian Poole on a one on one, and a fired up<br />\nCharlie Coker firing for daylight on a perfect<br />\nassist from Jim Feely. Then, there followed a<br />\nHopkins first when Coach Scott substituted<br />\nfreely against Mt. Washington - something no one<br />\nhad seen for many a season.<br />\nJoe Cowan's three goal and three assist<br />\nperformance against the Wolfpack netted him<br />\none of the game balls. However, it appeared he<br />\nwas only being easy on the oldtimers - scoring 4<br />\ngoals and4assists against Washington College.<br />\nHowever, after a fine first quarter in which the<br />\nBlue Jays scored only 4 times on the strength of<br />\n24 shots, there appeared to be a let down, as the<br />\nfired up stickmen from the Eastern Shore rang<br />\nthe bell three times in the second period to only<br />\none score by Hopkins - a rebound by Whit<br />\nHolden. Playing particularly brilliantly in the<br />\nfirst half was the Washington College goalie, Dave<br />\nBoulden, who at times appeared to measure 6<br />\nfeet by 6 feet.<br />\nScott Sparks Performance<br />\nScott must have said something to the<br />\ngroggy Jays, for after running out onto the field<br />\nat half time, they scored three goals in one<br />\nminute and 43 seconds to appear to put the game<br />\nout of reach. Yet, their stubborn opponents,<br />\napparently not cowed in the slightest by the<br />\nreturn of the Hopkins flashy championship form,<br />\nthen scored three more on their own with tallies<br />\nby Mueller and Regan. Jimmie Feely and Charlie<br />\nGoodell rose to meet this latest challenge - each<br />\nfooling a now tiring Boulden before the third<br />\nquarter ended. Thereafter, the Jays coasted on<br />\nshots by Goodell once more, Cowan, and a now<br />\nhot Jim Feely who finished the day with three<br />\ngoals and two assists.<br />\nHowever, the overall Blue Jay<br />\nperformance, against a team missing two starting<br />\nattackmen and running only two real midfields,<br />\nwas not overwhelming. Hopkins could certainly<br />\nnot look forward to pulling the tiger's tail three<br />\ndays later unless its lethargic style suddenly<br />\npicked up a few beats.<br />\nWhen Princeton opened the scoring at 2;56<br />\non an extra man play with almost ridiculous ease,<br />\nit appeared that last year's champions had still<br />\nnot come back to earth. However, at 5:40 Joe<br />\nCowan fed Charlie Goodell who proceeded to<br />\nembarass Princeton goalie and thereafter Hopkins<br />\nnever trailed. Charlie Coker, trying to forget a<br />\ndrive against Washington College where he ended<br />\nin the goal instead of the ball, roll-dodged his<br />\nopponent with such finesse that the poor fellow<br />\nended up running on his hands backward. Coker<br />\nthen dodged a few more Tigers and gently placed<br />\nthe ball in the nets to give Hopkins a 2-1 lead<br />\nwith 7:34 gone in the first quarter.<br />\nIt was in the second quarter that the Blue\u2022<br />\n<br />\nJays began to evidence their old form. Kahl<br />\nscored twice, while Cowan and Bill Donovan on a<br />\npicture book shot to the far corner on a left-hand<br />\ndrive, also upped the score. Princeton's lone goal<br />\nleft the contest at 6-3 at half time. Not forgetting<br />\nthe dramatic burst of Wednesday, the Jays<br />\nblitzed the now kittenish Tigers in the third<br />\nperiod - out-playing them to the tune of 5-1 on a<br />\nsmart defense and aggressive offense. As last<br />\nyear, the Hopkins defense was taken for granted.<br />\nHowever, Coach Scott had awarded game balls to<br />\ntwo of the starting trio of Clark, Cardillo, and<br />\nWeiss over vacation - showing all of you readers<br />\njust where the smart money is.<br />\nBack to the action, Cowan started the blitz<br />\non an unassisted goal at 1:04 of the quarter, and<br />\nwas soon copied by a hungry Charlie Coker(who<br />\nfell victim to fate with two pipe shots later in the<br />\nday), an awesome stinger from the cannon of<br />\nPhil Buck, and skilled accuracy shots from Huge<br />\nTuna Latson and the irrepresible Charlie Goodell,<br />\nwho appeared to have drawn his inspiration from<br />\nwearing his old Severn pants in practice.<br />\nIndeed, so impressive had the Blue Jays<br />\nshowing been, that Coach Scott emptied the<br />\nbench with only a couple of minutes gone in the<br />\nquarter. As Coach Thompson of Princeton<br />\ngloated in glee, his boys proceeded to pump in<br />\nthree quick goals and were only held in check<br />\nwhen Scott hurridly sent back his first-stringer<br />\nwith half the period to go. Before Cowan (who<br />\nelse?) scored at 14:31 on an assist from Feely,<br />\nthere were quite a few tense moments with the<br />\ncrowd loving it all the way.<br />\nThus, the team emerged victorious from a<br />\nfull vacation schedule ready to play host to the<br />\nhottest team in the nation: the much improved<br />\nVirginia Cavaliers. There is no doubt that if they<br />\nplay as in the third quarter against Princeton,<br />\nCoach Beardmore's boys will .cool down a little,<br />\nbut I keep having nightmares about the second<br />\nquarter against Washington College.<br />\nNews-Letter predicts: Hopkins 12, Virginia 6.<br />\n<br />\nFrosh Track Team<br />\nStrongest in Years<br />\nFollowing last year's six-man team, Coach<br />\nDon Masken and Varsity Co-Captains Al<br />\nGoldberg and Paul Carlson decided that such a<br />\ndebacle was not to happen again. Thus, an active<br />\nrecruiting program among resident freshmen with<br />\ntrack experience and/or track enthusiasm was<br />\ninstituted. In addition, a winter conditioning<br />\nprogram was well-attended, particularly by the<br />\nfreshmen. The result is a freshman team which,<br />\nfor the first time in a few years, is likely to be<br />\nable to successfully handle its difficult schedule.<br />\nThe prize of this litter is Mark Cummings,<br />\nlast year's Hawaiian state champ in the 440.<br />\nMark, though, is likely to concentrate on the<br />\nsprints (100 and 220) and the Mile- Relay, as<br />\nCoach Masken has two more top quality<br />\nquarter-milers, Boy Garnet and Bert Eisenstadt.<br />\nRounding out these sprinters are two developing<br />\n100 and 220 specialists, Grant Peoples and Coliri<br />\nCline.<br />\nlhe frosh distance men, however, are well<br />\naware of the quality of their sprinting<br />\nteammates, and are not to be outdone. The<br />\nabilities and potential of half-milers Bert<br />\nStammerjohn, Pete Heikler, and Phil Gallagher<br />\nhave not excaped the Coach's attention, nor have<br />\nthose of Milers Mike Lauren, Jim Campbell, and<br />\nof two-milers Guy Peluso and Don Welsch.

ESTIS<br />\nFour years ago, the only winter sport<br />\nWhich people ever spoke about was basketball.<br />\nFour years ago, the swimming team was just<br />\ngetting organized, but the wrestling team had<br />\nbeen here for a long time. The grapplers weren't<br />\nexpected to win and for a time in the 1950's<br />\nthey were relegated to the status of a club team<br />\nbecause of the lack of interest by the<br />\nundergraduate student body.<br />\nBut that was four years ago, when the Blue Jays<br />\nachieved a 3-6 record and appeared destined to remain in<br />\nthe ranks of the losers. In 1966, however, something was<br />\ndifferent on the grappler team. That difference was a<br />\nYoung coach who had recently graduated from Wayne<br />\nState University in Michigan and had only one year of<br />\ncoaching experience. The young coach learned quickly<br />\nand so did his charges. In three years, Kyle Smith has<br />\nmade people take notice of the grapplers, finishing this<br />\nseason with an 8-3 record. That same coach is leaving<br />\nHopkins at the end of this semester.<br />\nWhy would such a relatively successful individual<br />\ndecide suddenly to leave Hopkins and seek a career in<br />\nthe field of business? One wonders how anyone<br />\nwho has<br />\nbeen so completely involved in an activity and a school<br />\nCould choose to sell emblems, rather than continue<br />\n,c\u00b0aching? We might ask Coach Ciccarone who is also<br />\nleaving or the several other coaches who have remained<br />\nat Hopkins<br />\nfor a very short time and then sought careers<br />\nelsewhere<br />\nNeed for Family Life<br />\nTheir personal reasons may differ to an extent.<br />\nCoach Smith has two children and is originally from<br />\n<br />\nDetroit, Michigan. His two sons see him only rarely, and<br />\nhis wife has little opportunity to make new friends in<br />\nBaltimore with her husband occupied with Hopkins<br />\nathletics six days a week. I wonder how - nany of<br />\nHopkins' administration or faculty would be willing to<br />\nput in the same amount of time for the \"glory\" of the<br />\nBlue Jays.<br />\nPutting personal reasons aside, the major factor<br />\nwhich enters into the picture of the Hopkins coach is<br />\n<br />\nthree weeks ago by the Ad-Hoc Committee on Physical<br />\nEducation, \"The Department is currently operating on a<br />\nsub-marginal basis- to merely maintain current programs<br />\nand policy is impossible without an increased University<br />\ncommitment and additional financial support.\"<br />\nThe Committee urged the University to initiate a<br />\nminimal increase of 15% in the salaries of the<br />\nprofessional staff. They viewed the present situation as<br />\nsuch: \"Current salaries are low and approaching the<br />\nnon-competitive level.\" As a member of that special<br />\ncommittee, I was shown a salary schedule which can<br />\nonly be rated as \"appalling.\"<br />\nCoach Smith's decision was, in his own words,<br />\n\"The toughest decision I've had to make in my life.\" He<br />\nlooks back at his three years at Hopkins with mixed<br />\nemotions. He is particularly proud of the contribution<br />\nwhich the wrestling program is making on campus and is<br />\nespecially pleased about his role in developing certain<br />\nindividuals on the teams which he has coached. (He<br />\ncoached wrestling, freshman baseball, and was assistant<br />\ncoach of the football team). He points to this past year's<br />\nvarsity wrestling team captain, Richard Dryden, as a<br />\nprimary example. Only the coaches, out of the entire<br />\nfaculty at Homewood, have shown a concerted interest<br />\nin all phases of a student's life, whether it be the<br />\nintellectual or the social.<br />\nKyle Smith is leaving and there is no way that this<br />\ncould be changed. But it is hoped that the University<br />\nwill learn its lesson from this tragic occurrence. The<br />\npresent coaching staff is young and shows promise of<br />\nbeing the best in Hopkins history. This hope can only<br />\ncome to pass if the University will act now to keep these<br />\nmen here and attract more people like Coach Smith. I<br />\nwonder if Hopkins is up to this challenge?<br />\n<br />\nfinances. Hopkins ranks among the top ten in average<br />\nfaculty salary, yet we can just barely afford to pay our<br />\ncoaches what the average public school teacher in<br />\nBaltimore makes during his first year. The pay situation<br />\nis a disgrace to a university of the calibre of Hopkins.<br />\nBlame has to be directed towards all levels of the<br />\nadministration from the President down to Director of<br />\nAthletics, Marshal Turner. Dr. Gordon, here only two<br />\nyears, cannot be totally faulted. His predecessor, Milton<br />\nEisenhower was the moving force in increasing faculty<br />\nsalaries but he never worried about those men who have<br />\nthe closest relationship with the students among all the<br />\nmembers of the faculty. Dr. Eisenhower is a strong<br />\nsupporter of Hopkins athletics and still attends<br />\nswimming matches, wrestling matches and lacrosse<br />\ngames, but he failed to adequately provide for those<br />\nindividuals who guide the student athletes.<br />\nMorale Problem<br />\nThe second factor which enters into a Hopkins<br />\ncoach's decision to leave lies in the area of \"morale\".<br />\nThere is a definite barrier between the coaches, the<br />\ndirector of athletics and the administration. Coach<br />\nSmith felt that there was a \"true lack of support\" by the<br />\nUniversity. As was pointed out in a special report issued<br />\n<br />\nVarsity Track Team Loses Opening Meet to Swarthmore<br />\nBy JIM BERNSTEIN<br />\n<br />\nIn its opening meet of the<br />\n1969 season, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nTrack Team lost to Swarthmore<br />\nC.01 1ege, 89-56, a most<br />\naPpointing loss, since most of<br />\ntile team's members had managed<br />\nto survive the non rigors of Easter<br />\nvacation and return to the track<br />\nWars in reasonably good<br />\nCondition.<br />\nUnfortunately, travel<br />\nJr angements held up four or five<br />\n!Irst-liners so<br />\nthat they could not get<br />\nback in time for the meet. And, as 25 of<br />\n!he 33 point difference between the two<br />\nt,eahis came from five fewer first place<br />\nIttn.ishes for the Blue Jays, it seems that<br />\nIS was the key factor which ended the<br />\nPos.sibility for<br />\nwhat had shaped up as<br />\nquite a close meet.<br />\n<br />\nThe day's best performances for<br />\nA \u00b0Pkins were turned in on the field<br />\nvents as well as on the track. In fact,<br />\nwarthmore's margin of victory in the<br />\nneld (40-23) was only one point greater<br />\nplan was its track supremacy (49-33).<br />\ntlly gratifying was the six-point<br />\n'<br />\nullerformance turned in his first varsity<br />\nby shotputter and discus thrower<br />\n'id Schroedel, expecially his 41 foot<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n2 inch shot put.<br />\n101<br />\nGerry McKinney took second<br />\nplace in the pole vault on the basis of<br />\nonly one more miss than the winner at<br />\nthe preliminary heights. Finally, Gem<br />\nMaurer took both the high jump (5 ft. 8<br />\ninches) and the long jump(20 ft. 1 in.).<br />\nDebits in the field consisted mainly in<br />\nthe lack of support by the squad's<br />\nback-up men in these events, as the Jays<br />\ntook only one third place here. Also,<br />\nthe Swarthmore sweep of the triple<br />\njump constituted a severe blow.<br />\nOn the track, the Jays' back-up<br />\nmen held their own against the Garnets,<br />\nbut their lead men were unable to hald<br />\noff their opponents. There were,<br />\nhowever, three quite bright spots here<br />\nfor the home team. Captain Al Goldberg<br />\ncopped first place honors in both the<br />\n100 and the 220, the latter in the<br />\nrespectable for early April time of :22.5<br />\nseconds.<br />\nSenior Jeff Lauren equaled his<br />\nbest dual meet time of last year in an<br />\neasy win in the mile with a 4:35.8 time.<br />\nAnd Junior Bill Preston recorded his<br />\nbest time ever in the 880(2:03.4) in the<br />\nmeet's most exciting race and missed<br />\nwinning it by the width of an expanded<br />\nchest.<br />\nIn all, the whole affair was best<br />\n<br />\nHopkins students, new and old, eat at<br />\n<br />\nsummarized by Coach Masken, when he<br />\nsaid that \"It was a shame to lose one we<br />\nshould have won\".

Draws Close<br />\nBy SANDRA HAMMER<br />\nThe Dunbar Community School, a center<br />\ncity high school on Caroline Street, is<br />\nculminating its year fight for the development of<br />\na better school to serve both the students and<br />\nlocal residents.<br />\nIn February of 1968 the Dunbar Charette,<br />\na type of brainstorming session, was initiated to<br />\nstudy education and community oriented<br />\n<br />\nproblems, their causes, and potential solutions.<br />\nThe committee submitted its proposals this<br />\nMarch to the Community Council for a new<br />\nDunbar School, and final considerations are now<br />\nbeing made.<br />\nThe Chareite, composed of students, parents,<br />\nteachers, community participants, and experts in the<br />\nfield of education, is funded by federal grants, the<br />\nMaryland State Department of Education, and the<br />\nBaltimore City Planning Committee.<br />\n<br />\nCommencement Date Moved tip<br />\nThis year's commencement exercises will take<br />\nplace on Friday, June 6, instead of Tuesday, June 10 as<br />\nwas originally scheduled.<br />\nKingman Brewster, president of Yale University,<br />\nwill be the main speaker at the morning ceremonies in<br />\nKeyser Quadrangle.<br />\nCommencement was moved up as a result of a<br />\nrequest by a majority of the senior medical students to<br />\npermit them to have greater time between graduation<br />\nand the start of their internships.<br />\nThe suggestion was conveyed by President Lincoln<br />\nGordon to the various institutions of the University for<br />\nconsideration.<br />\nCertification<br />\nAt Homewood, the main problem concerned the<br />\nquestion of complications arising from the certification<br />\nof students for graduation. Final exams end on June 3rd<br />\nand this leaves only two days for the registrar to clear<br />\nlast minute records.<br />\nIt ,was shown that changes in a senior's status had<br />\nbeen made up until the last minute at all previous<br />\ngraduations.<br />\nA question of interpretation arose over whether<br />\nthe tradional view of commencement as the \"official<br />\nawarding- of the degree had to be retained. It was<br />\ndecided that it did not, makinit it possible for a student<br />\n<br />\nto receive a blank diploma and to finish settling his<br />\nrecords after the actual ceremonies, while still<br />\nparticipating in the exercises.<br />\nJune Week<br />\nA second problem, concerning the shift in date,<br />\ndirectly involved all of the members of the senior class.<br />\nThis was concerned with how to rearrange the June<br />\nWeek activities around a new date. Robert Bilgrave and<br />\nDr. William Bevan, in consultation with the senior class<br />\nofficers and Student Council officers, determined that<br />\nthis barrier could be overcome.<br />\nThose in favor of the change felt it might increase<br />\ninterest in certain of tile Week's activities if they were<br />\nconcentrated and not spread out. Those opposed felt<br />\nthat the change would hurt attendance at the Senior<br />\nBanquet which was scheduled for Sunday,June 8.<br />\nJohn Kelly, president of the Class of 1969,<br />\nexpressed great favor for the shift in date, since he saw it<br />\neliminating the tedious nature of a June Week stretched<br />\nout over ten days.<br />\nAs it is presently scheduled, the Boat Ride and the<br />\nBull Roast will be held on Wednesday or Thursday<br />\nbefore Commencement, and the remainder of the<br />\nactivities will take place that weekend ending on<br />\nSunday,June 8.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nEngineering Grant<br />\n<br />\nTwo typical comments which the pollsters<br />\nreceived are from La Jolla, California businessmen \u2014<br />\n\"Every one of the (the protestors) should be tossed<br />\nright out of college and put in the army.\" An elderly<br />\nwoman from Lynchburg, Va., said \u2014 \"You give them a<br />\nbreak and they bite the hand that feeds them.\"<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins is one of three -universities to be selected by the National Academy of Engineering to<br />\nchart methods for solving problems connected with the<br />\ndevelopment of bio-medical engineering.<br />\nThe results of the $56,220 study will be reported<br />\nto the Committee on Interplay of Engineering with<br />\nBiology and Medicine.

Protests were held in 45 cities and were<br />\norganized as the \"April Action\" by the National Action<br />\nGroup.<br />\nIn New York, fifty to one-hundred thousand people<br />\ngathered in Central Park and peacefully marched up Sixth<br />\nAvenue in a heavy rain. The marchers wore armbands<br />\nreading \"33,000\", the number of American dead in<br />\nVietnam, which now exceeds the death tool in Korea.<br />\nThe demonstration in New York was marred<br />\noccassionally by hecklers, but there were no major<br />\nincidents between conflicting groups.

Both the<br />\nposition of Levering Hall in the University structure and<br />\nDr. Wickwire's role in the university are in question.<br />\nThe controve4 again flared up<br />\nNEWS<br />\nafter Dr. Lincoln Gordon received a<br />\nletter supporting the position of<br />\nANALYSIS<br />\nLevering Hall. The letter stated that the<br />\nLevering organization should not be<br />\nunder the jurisdiction of Mr. Robert Bilgrave, Director<br />\nof Student Affairs. To do so, it argued, would threaten<br />\nthe present S. A. programs. The writer of the letter<br />\nprefered to remain anonymous.<br />\nIn his response, Dr. Gordon indicated that there<br />\nhas developed a great deal of misunderstanding about<br />\nthe Levering Hall controversy as well as the position of<br />\nthe Chaplain. Much of these difficulties arose, he<br />\ncontinued, from misconceptions concerning the status of<br />\nboth Levering Hall-before the January take-over of the<br />\nYMCA operation by the University-and the Chaplain's<br />\noffice at Homewood.<br />\nGordon stated further that there has been no<br />\nchange in the reporting procedure of the University<br />\nChaplain. He said that the Chaplain's responsibility had<br />\nalways been to the Dean of Arts and Sciences (presently<br />\nDr. Allyn Kimbal) through the Director of Student<br />\nAffairs. The post is presently held by Mr. Robert<br />\nBilgrave.<br />\nJames Archibald, President of the Student<br />\nAssociation, stated, on the other hand, that there has<br />\nnever been, there is not now nor should there ever be<br />\nsuch an administrative arrangement. \"It would stiffle<br />\nus,\" lie claimed.<br /><br />\nThe current status of the budget is that Robert<br />\nBilgrave, Director of the Office of Student Affairs, has<br />\nrecommended S54,000 and passed this proposal on to<br />\nDean Allyn Kimball of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nKimball is then to submit the report, with or without his<br />\nrecommendation, to President Gordon for consideration.<br />\nThe SA is currently spending between $58,000<br />\nand $59,000, and has asked for $67,000 for the coming<br />\nyear. If the S54,000 figure is approved, the SA would be<br />\nforced to forego expansion and cut back within its<br />\npresent programs. Said SA president Jim Archibald,<br />\n\"Unless the budget is passed in full, I'm really afraid<br />\nthere are going to be problems.\" He added that \"We are<br />\nhoping to bring as much pressure to bear as possible,:<br />\nwith the intention of assisting the administration to its<br />\ndecision.\"<br />\nPassarella, when questioned as to the course of<br />\naction of the SC if their resolution is ignored,<br />\nmaintained \"We will cross that bridge when we come to<br />\nit; I don't see any point in threatening anyone before a<br />\ndecision has been made.\" Archibald expressed hope that<br />\neven if only $54,000 is passed, \"the university will come<br />\nup with the rest somehow, in order to keep the SA one<br />\nof the most, if not the most,important organizations on<br />\ncampus.\"<br />\nThe controversy is grounded in the status of<br />\nLevering Hall and the Chaplain's office within the<br />\nUniversity, as well as the Levering Hall budget. Both<br />\nproblems arose as a result of a complex series of<br />\nnegotiations between the Baltimore YMCA and the<br />\nUniversity over the ownership of Levering Hall.<br /><br />\nThese discussions began during the final year of<br />\nDr. Eisenhower's administration. Disagreement over the<br />\nprice to be paid for the building had blocked the sale for<br />\na lengthy period of time; this was finally resolved by the<br />\nuse of a private appraiser. In the meantime, the budget<br />\ndifficulties of the SA began to grow.<br /><br />\nThe YMCA had refused to increase the Levering<br />\nbudget ever since 1967 because- it anticipated that the<br />\nUniversity would be taking over all of its operations. The<br />\nUniversity still treated Levering as a YMCA program and<br />\nconsequently continued its support at the same level as<br />\nwhen the YMCA supported it. It was during this period<br />\nthat Dr. Wickwire, Chaplain of the Homewood Carnpus\u2022<br />\nexceeded the budget for Levering Hall through<br />\nexpansion of its various programs.<br />\nDuring the early months of 1969, the confusion<br />\nincreased. The head of the Baltimore YMCA informed<br />\nDr. Wickwire that the University would take over the<br />\nLevering Budget as of January 1. Dr. Wickwire and the<br />\nLevering Board of Managers Claimed that this<br />\ninformation took them completely by surprise.<br /><br />\nIn a letter from Dean Kimball, the Board of<br />\nManagers were informed that the University had made<br />\nno such agreement with the YMCA and that there would<br />\nshortly be meetings to discuss the status and budget of<br />\nLevering in the interim between its transfer from the<br />\nYMCA to the University. For the next month confusion<br />\nreigned.

Here is where General George<br />\nWashington resigned his commission,<br />\nANALYSIS the Peaee of Paris was signed and the<br />\nConstitutional Convention was first<br />\ncalled.<br />\nAnd here is where Bill Number SB 461, creating<br />\nthe position of secretary to the Board of Elections of<br />\nWicomico County, was enacted March 28.<br />\nThe Main Attraction<br />\nMore bills were passed in the Senate that day, but<br />\nthe main attraction was still an \"indiscrete\" senator. The<br />\nHonorable Frank J. McCourt had returned the day<br />\nbefore under the TV's glare to represent his constituency<br />\nduring the five remaining days of this session after<br />\nabandoning almost a year ago his second Baltimore<br />\ndistrict and his country for the world. After a jet-set<br />\ntravel pace, he wound up in India a few months ago in<br />\nthe hands of a bearded guru, with a Hindu-wedded<br />\nSpouse and under the surveillance of the Sun's New<br />\nDelhi bureau and police.<br />\nWhen McCourt arrived back in the United States<br />\nearlier this month, as instructed by his guru, he was<br />\nimmediately arrested on a narcotics rap. Finally bailed<br />\nout, he used last month his long-neglected vote to<br />\nabstain, and thus defeat, the pin ball machine bill \"out<br />\nof respect for the Senate.\"<br />\nTo Higher Grounds<br />\nFrom the Governor's reception room on the<br />\nsecond floor (the legislature is on the first) Annapolis<br />\nunfolds in narrow streets radiating from the State House.<br />\nOvergrown buildings of another age fight below for a<br />\nPlace in the afternoon sun. A door, preserved from olden<br />\ntimes except for bullet-proof glass and an electronic<br />\nlocking device, separates the Governor's office from his<br />\nguests.<br />\nMarvin Mandel shows his 49 Years with a<br />\nt hickening frame and eyes embedded in dour,<br />\nnonconcentric circles. Born in Baltimore, Mandel went<br />\nthrough the city schools and was graduated from the<br />\ntiniversity of Maryland. 13 years later he entered the<br />\nH011se of Delegates after working in a law firm and<br />\nParticipating in Baltimore city politics.<br />\nThe Governor answers questions curtly inbetween<br />\nPe draws (he was awarded the \"Pipesmoker of the<br />\nYear\" award as 1969's \"national figure who best<br />\nexemplifies the manly art of pipesmoking\"). His voice is<br />\ndeep, hoarse, and, at times, threatening. His face is well<br />\nWorn and emotionless.<br />\nThe Interview<br />\nGovernor Mandel said he supports the 75-25<br />\nF'residential Primary Bill (75% of the delegates to the<br /><br />\nDemocratic National Convention elected by the people<br />\nand 25% picked by the state central committee). He<br />\nappeared unmoved by the fact that earlier that day<br />\nSenator George McGovern, chairman of the Democratic<br />\nCommission on Party Structure, told Maryland's<br />\nJudiciary Proceedings Committee that the 25% selected<br />\nby the central committee would be in \"technical<br />\nviolation of the mandate of the 1968 Convention.\" The<br />\nConvention rules adoped last August stipulate that all<br />\ndelegates should be elected the year of the convention,<br />\nMcGovern said. The Maryland central committee will be<br />\nelected in 1970. Mandel headed an all-Humphrey<br />\nMaryland delegation in the '68 Convention.<br />\n4 Million Talkers<br />\nConcerning recent student bids for more power at<br />\nthe University of Maryland, Mandel stated, \"The only<br />\nthing I can do is to advise the Regents. This I have done.<br />\nI have supported more student representation.\" In the<br />\nfollowing question, the Governor acknowledged his<br />\npower to appoint the Regents. Mandel was more<br />\nemphatic on another side of college life. He referred to<br />\nthe much-puclicized U. of M. magazine nudes as<br />\n\"disgusting.\" \"To see that filthy language in print. This<br />\nis not a question of freedom of the press, but of<br />\ndecency.\"<br /><br />\nMandel's Achievements<br />\nGovernor Marvin Mandel received practically<br />\neverything he sought at the close of Maryland's General<br />\nAssembly at midnight, March 28.<br />\nThe legislature enacted more than 600 bills,<br />\nincluding some new and expanded executive programs.<br />\nTo finance the cost of government next year, the<br />\nAssembly also passed the $1.34-billion Mandel budget,<br />\nand raised the state sales tax from 3 to 4%.<br />\nThe administration successfully pushed the<br />\nfollowing legislation:<br />\n\u2014Creation of treatment centers for drug addicts.<br />\n\u2014Establishment of a planning authority in low-cost<br />\nhousing.<br />\n--Strengthening the state's Human Relations<br />\nCommission by giving it greater power of investigation.<br />\n\u2014Authorization of a new group to coordinate<br />\ndevelopment of a Baltimore rapid transit system.<br />\n--Re-establishment of a Presidential primary<br />\nelection in Maryland and selection of 75% of party<br />\nconvention delegations by the voters.<br />\n\u2014Granting of overtime pay for state employees and<br />\nthe state police as well as increased pensions for retired<br />\nemployees.<br />\nConsidered Mandel's most important<br />\naccomplishment was the legislature's enactment of his<br />\nproposals for constitutional change. A number of<br />\nconstitutional amendments will go on a special ballot<br />\nnext November.<br />\nThe most explosive of the proposals will be the<br />\nseries completely revamping Maryland's court system<br />\nand adding uniform qualifications for judges. One of the<br />\nproposals provides circuit and appellate judges not be<br />\nelected as is present but confirmed by the state Senate<br />\nevery 15 years.<br /><br />\nJADE EAST<br /><br />\nSTUDENTS<br />\nGOOD HUMOUR needs part time<br />\nsalesman now -- and full time<br />\nsalesmen through the Summer.<br /><br />\nThe Governor circumvented the question of<br />\nterminating state financial aid to disruptive students by<br />\npleading innocent of knowledge that such talk has been<br />\nheard in the State House. \"That is just talk. I never listen<br />\nto talk. There are four million talkers around here.\"<br />\nReplying to HEW's order to five Maryland state<br />\ncolleges to desegregate the Governor said, \"We had<br />\nalready been working on the problem\" He, along with<br />\nthe college presidents, stated he was not informed of the<br />\nHEW statement until after its release to the press.<br />\nWhen asked how he will overcome the financial<br />\nheadache Agnew left in his wake, he said he'd \"take<br />\naspirin.\" He then proceeded to denounce this<br />\nreporter\u2014\"Do you have 6 hours to discuss this? What<br />\nwill I do? Now isn't that a stupid question?\"\u2014speaking in<br />\nthe bittersweet rage only a skilled politician can muster<br />\nwithout a smile.<br />\nMoney Is The Hang-Up<br />\nThe most pressing issue facing Maryland is money,<br />\nand the lack of it, Mandel emphasized in another<br />\nquestion\u2014this time it was answered\u2014on what he believes<br />\nare the most urgent needs of the state. \"The federal<br />\ngovernment must share some of the money it takes away<br />\nfrom the states through taxes...Our bond rate is now at<br />\n4.32% That is the highest in our history, and we have the<br />\nbest state credit rating...We spent $10 million last year<br />\non the Baltimore police and over $5 million this<br />\nyear...It's hard to give priorities. There are so many<br />\nthings we need. The most we now need is money.\" He<br />\nreceived $62 million of it that day. The House of<br />\nDelegates approved raising the sales tax 1% to 4%.<br />\nMeanwhile the General Assembly last Friday<br />\nratified another of Mandel's set of constitutional<br />\namendments. This one would allow the voters to decide<br />\nin November whether the Governor can pick judges to<br />\nMaryland's' court system thereby hopefully ending the<br />\npresent patronage of local judicial posts.<br />\nAids to the Governor said the 19-year-old voting<br />\namendment was scrubbed this year in ordernot to have<br />\nthe controversial voting issue interfere with the \u00b0thet<br />\nconsittutional reforms. Governor Mandel said in the<br />\ninterview that he would continue to press for a lowei<br />\nvoting age although he saw \"nothing magic\" about the<br />\nage 19. In 1954 as a freshman delegate he proposed a<br />\nstate voting age of 18.<br />\nThe Art of Politics<br />\nAnd in the late afternoon that Friday on the<br />\nHouse floor, delegates from Baltimore county's seconc<br />\ndistrict evoked \"neighborhood rights\" in regard to the<br />\nslot machine bill. They wanted to be excluded from the<br />\nslots, and asked their colleagues in vain \"to respect local<br />\nlocal courtesy.\" Just an hour before, the Governor hac<br />\nasked me what my major was, with his farewell<br />\nhandshake. \"Political science?

In Chicago<br />\n10,000 people marched through the downtown area despite strong<br />\nwinds, and occasional heckling along State Street.<br />\nEight hundred demonstrators marched from City Hall to<br />\nWyman Park in Baltimore in the largest demonstration this city has<br />\nseen since the march in support of the \"Catonsville 9\" last October.<br />\nThere was a minor outbreak of trouble as protestors gathered<br />\nin City Hall plaza for the start of the demonstration. Several youths<br />\nwith armbands from the National States' Rights party were led away<br />\nfrom the peace people by police when they started to shout \"We<br />\nwant dead reds\" and \"Commie\" at the demonstrators. No one was<br />\narrested.<br />\nThe marchers gathered around the Civil War monument in<br />\nWyman Park at the end of the march to listen to speakers and folk<br />\nmusic. They planted a pine tree to symbolize life and resistence to<br />\nwar. The protestors then attached a balloon to the arm of the statue<br />\nreading \"End the War.\"<br /><br />\nOn October 22 of last year, Kimbal, Bevan<br />\nBilgrave and the Board of Managers for Levering<br />\nhall came to a tentative agreement. Archibald's<br />\nunderstanding was that after October 22 the<br />\nLevering Hall programs were to be completely<br />\nrun by the Board of Managers,\"This was only to<br />\nformalize a condition which had previously<br />\nexisted,\" he said.<br />\n\"We heard nothing from the<br />\nAdministration and we felt that they accepted<br />\nthe minutes (of the meeting)\" said Archibald.<br />\n\"Wickwire was never expected to report to<br />\nBilgrave. You can talk to every damn member of<br />\nthe Board of Managers and they'll tell you the<br />\nsame thing, that's what was said!\"<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire admitted that the<br />\nsituation was very confused and that all<br />\nstatements on Leverings' position in the<br />\nUniversity conflicted. \"I just don't know.\"<br /><br />\nSUPPORT LEVERING<br />\nAs has been made clear over the past few issues, the<br />\nNews-Letter is quite concerned about Levering Hall's future status<br />\non campus. Last week we asked members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity to show their feelings by sending letters of support to<br />\nus. Due to space limitations we were unable to print the volume of<br />\nmail received. It is, however, important that the administration be<br />\naware of student, faculty, and community feelings. We thus urge our<br />\nreaders to continue writing. For those who want merely to express<br />\nsupport, we have included a clip-out which can be sent or brought to<br />\nthe News-Letter office.

I also urge<br />\nthat the proposals of Levering's directors concerning that<br />\n1\u00b0 group's status withing the University be adopted.<br /><br />\nArchibald was more adamant, \"We can<br />\nprove it all, we have files, copies of the minutes<br />\nof all our minutes, there is no question in our<br />\nminds. What they (the Administration) say is just<br />\nnot true.\"<br />\nNo Solution<br />\nAlthough there may be a long fight over<br />\nthe position of Levering in the University, it<br />\nappears unlikely that any concrete solution can<br />\nbe reached until some common decision as to the<br />\npresent and past status of Levering can be<br /><br />\nreached.<br />\n\"At present we are all working at er00<br />\npurposed,'. stated Archibald. \"We in the S.

Their report called for an<br />\nend to the mandatory dormitory residence for freshmen and the<br />\nsuspension of parietals.<br />\nThe question of mandatory residence last arose two years ago when<br />\nHopkins S.D.S. issued a study of the requirement and asked the<br />\nAdministration to abolish the rule. At that time, due to the S.D.S.'s<br />\ngeneral lack of influence, their report was completely ignored by<br />\nAdministrators and brushed off by the Student Council. We are<br />\nencouraged by the fact that this issue has been broached again, and this<br />\ntime, by an \"official\" group which cannot be easily ignored.<br />\nThere are a number of factors which the University claims would<br />\nmiliate against ending the dorm rule. At the time of the SDS report, then<br />\nDean of Homewood Schools, Dr. G. Wilson Shaffer pointed to an obvious<br />\nfactor \u2014 the financial loss which Hopkins would face if the number of<br />\nstudents living in the dorms drastically dropped. Another prickly point<br />\nConcerned the availability of off-campus housing and the difficulties<br />\nMuch would face incoming freshmen should they try to find an<br />\napartment upon entering Hopkins. There were a number of other<br />\narguments which we feel were less valid \u2014 the freshman's \"loss of a sense<br />\nof community,\" and the alleged problems of adjustment for new students.<br />\nAs to the present report, Mr. Bilgrave stated that even if the<br />\nrecommendations were adopted, implementation could not take place<br />\nntil 1971. This, of course, is perfectly understandable \u2014 a demand for<br />\nimmediate revision would be unreasonable considering the financial<br />\ncommittment which the University has made so far to dormitory housing.<br />\nHowever, \"understanding\" for the University's financial stake in the<br />\ndormitories can only be continued to a point. The University's planning<br />\nfor on-campus housing, as is obvious to anyone who has lived in the<br />\ndorms, verges on catastrophe. For those, like Mr. Bilgrave, who point out<br />\nthe dorm's social advantages, we counter with the poll of about 1/3 of<br />\ndormitory residents two years ago which demonstrated that the social<br />\nbenefits were heavily outweighed by the poor quality of life in the Alumni<br />\nMemorial Residences.

There never was a<br />\n\"Hopkins community,\" and unless the Administration is willing to build<br />\nan attractive student housing complex on the model of Yale or Harvard,<br />\nthere is no way, using material means, that true community will ever come<br />\ninto being. As to the problems of \"adaptation,\" we can only say that<br />\nthere are many sophomores,juniors and seniors who are no more mentally<br />\nqualified than freshmen to manage an off-campus life responsibly.<br />\nTo overcome any potential University guilt feelings over letting<br />\nfreshmen face the cruel world alone, should the rule be abolished, we<br />\nwould suggest the following plan:<br />\n\u2014 Entering freshmen who wished to live off-campus must have<br />\nparental permission in writing.

Do<br />\nyou agree with Rennie Davis, who called it \"political<br />\nrepression4'? and if so, would you expand upon it.<br />\nDELLINGER: I think its political repression, all right,<br />\nbut I don't like to throw the term around too much,<br />\nbecause I think that the attempt really is to use symbolic<br />\nand focused. political repression in order .to have an<br />\neffect upon the Movement. The United States_ attempts<br />\nin its way to accomplish the same ends, the same<br />\nobjectives that more obviously repressive societies have<br />\naccomplished by a combination of co-optation and<br />\nrepression.<br />\nI think that the picking out of eight people from<br />\nChicago, and put that with the Spock-Coffin-Ferber<br />\ntrial, put that with the Oakland 7, which of course has<br />\nturned out to be an acquittal, and in particular you put<br />\nit together with the oppression of the Black Panther<br />\nParty, and I think that its an attempt to pick off a few<br />\npeople and to warn other people not to get out of line<br />\nbecause this kind of thing could be in store for them.<br />\nBut there is a difference between the stage that we<br />\nare in now and what I'd call full scale repression, which<br />\nat least for the white anti-war movement has not come<br />\nabout.<br />\nN-L: In your speech you said you saw signs of this full<br />\nscale repression coming on. What are those signs?<br />\nDELLINGER: I think that the government would find<br />\nitself unable to carry on the war very much longer<br />\nwithout launching such a full scale repression. That is<br />\nwhy it is probably going to be forced to end the war. I<br />\nthink that public opinion has been so aroused and .<br />\nsensitized by the war in Vietnam that it would be a very,<br />\ndifficult time for them to launch a full scale repression.<br />\nTo keep the proper perspective, I should have<br />\nmentioned before the Presidio defendants and other<br />\nGI's. I think that is where the kid gloves are taken off<br />\nand the real repression is taking place.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that more action will be taken<br />\nagainst the police in Chicago?<br />\nDELLINGER: The eight policemen are scapegoats, and I<br />\ndon't see any determination to change the system in<br />\nChicago. There are so many assumptions in a society like<br />\nours that it's terribly hard to really get at them. And one<br />\nof the assumptions is that there are criminals and there<br />\nare law-abiding people, and very few people probe to<br />\nWhat I think is the truth of the matter, that the law itself<br />\nis criminal. Law and order is another word for the status<br />\nquo, and the status quo today protects property above<br />\npeople. It keeps people in slum tenements and in jobs<br />\nand factories where they don't have control over their<br />\nlives, don't have creativity.<br />\nOne of the things that I learned from previous<br />\nindictments and times in jail is that prison really is filled<br />\nwith victims of our society. In my own conception you<br />\ncan't begin to get at the problem of the police until you<br />\nget at the problem of the jails, until you get at the<br />\nproblem of property. The police are innocent victims<br />\ntoo. Well, none of us are really innocent. Their job is to<br />\nprotect property and to preserve economic inequality,<br />\nthe vast differentials in wealth and power. That's their<br />\njob.<br />\nAnd whether they do it with clean hands and<br />\ngentile methods, as sometimes happens, particularly with<br />\nmiddle class people, or whether they do it with clubs<br />\nand Mace, as happens particularly in black communities<br />\nand happened to middle class people in Chicago at the<br />\nConvention, that is not a fundamental difference.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel that you will be convicted?<br />\nDELLINGER: It's a little speculative at this point, but I<br />\nguess that anybody who is going to court in Chicago,<br />\nhaving affronted and really humiliated Mayor Daley for<br />\na world-wide audience, and knowing how the courts of<br />\n-Chicago are controlled by the Daley machine, I guess he<br />\nhas to expect to be convicted.<br />\nAlso, we know that the indictments were held up<br />\nfor at least ten days while Nixon's lieutenants studied<br />\nthem, and apparently rephrased them and reformulated<br />\nthem. So it's quite clear that the combination of the<br />\nwounded bear of Richard Daley and the new image<br />\nRichard Nixon, who wants to preserve law and order and<br />\na consensus without solving any of the problems, that<br />\nthey have combined to frame the indictments.<br />\nOn the other hand, the law is so transparently<br />\nunconstitutional and repressive in itself, that there is a<br />\ngood chance that a conviction, if there is one, will be<br />\noverturned later. But I myself believe that the courts,<br />\nincluding the much praised and much attacked Supreme<br />\nCourt, basically :do not operate on eternal legal<br />\nprinciples of justice, but they do reflect the political<br /><br />\nclimate of the society of the time. It's speculative at this<br />\npoint to know what the political climate will be at the<br />\ntime that our case comes to the Supreme Court, if it<br />\ncome there. Perhaps the war will be over, perhaps we<br />\nwill be in some kind of temporarily tranquil period in<br />\nwhich there will be pressure for amnesty for war victims,<br />\npolitical prisoners, and so forth, and perhaps we will be<br />\npart of that, along with deserters and draft resisters and<br />\nothers.<br />\nOn the other hand, the basic problems that the<br />\nUnited States faces in the world may remain. There will<br />\ncontinue to be revolts and unwillingness on the part of<br />\nThird World people to accept American dominance and<br /><br />\nperhaps we can take the word conspiracy and give it<br />\ngood instead of bad overtones.<br />\nN-L: To shift to a more general topic. The New Left<br />\ntoday seems to agree more or less on what changes are<br />\nnecessary in American society and government, but<br />\ncannot agree on the tactics to use to implement these<br />\nchanges. Do you think that unity is ever possible?<br />\nDELLINGER: I never want unity at the expense of<br />\ndiversity. There has to be some combination of unity<br />\nand diversity, I think. A group of people who work<br />\ntogether politically, whether in one organization or in a<br />\ncoalition, or maybe a combination of the two, should<br />\nnever aim at being monolithic. One has to encourage<br /><br />\nBe<br />\nre<br />\nto<br /><br />\nbo<br />\nrec<br />\nth<br /><br />\nof<br />\nbo]<br />\nDAVID DELLINGER (center),flanked by co-conspirators Jerry Rubin (left) and Abbie Hoffman (right)<br /><br />\ncontrol. There are all kinds of areas where people have<br />\nbegun to realize the emptiness of the American way of<br />\nlife, and the injustice of it. So it may be a time of<br />\nturmoil and conflict when it comes to the Supreme<br />\nCourt, and a time when the Supreme Court will want to<br />\nuphold the convictions, and play that end of its<br />\nweaponry.<br />\nN-L: Would you explain why Nixon's approval of these<br />\nindictments was necessary.<br />\nDELLINGER: We know that it was necessary, and my<br />\ninterpretation of it would be that Nixon was coming in<br />\nobviously with a keen eye toward public relations, to his<br />\nown image, and to setting the tone of his administration.<br />\nThese first few months are very important.<br />\nThe indictments are under a section of the Civil<br />\nRights law of 1968. This to me is perhaps a minor<br />\nindication, but a valid one, of how legislation can be<br />\nperverted. Humane liberal instincts that people have, and<br />\nwhich they think they can express through laws, rather<br />\nthan revolutionary changes in themselves and society,<br />\nturn out to have these jokers in them. The people who<br />\ncontrol Congress and ultimately control both the<br />\nframing and the enforcement of the laws are not<br />\nhumanitarian and are not egalitarian.<br />\nN-L: You mentioned in your speech that you want the<br />\nspotlight focused upon the issues of your indictment,<br />\nrather upon the individuals or the individual case. Yet in<br />\nJerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman you have two rather<br />\nflamboyant partners.<br />\nDELLINGER: Actually, Jerry and Abbie are from New<br />\nYork; we're the only three indictees from there. So I've<br />\nhad quite a bit of chance to talk with them since the<br />\nindictments, as I did before, of course. They share the<br />\n'same conviction. Now that doesn't mean that they are<br />\ngoing to abandon their individual styles, any more than<br />\nI'm going to abandon mine. But they do feel that we<br />\nhave to wage a political defense which tries to organize_<br />\npeople around the issues, rather than around us.<br />\nThey happen to be very funny and dramatic<br />\nindividuals, and I'm sure that they will say and do things<br />\nwhich will emphasize their personalities. But they will<br />\nnonetheless be pointing in the direction of the<br />\nunderlying issues, which are everything from ending the<br />\nwar in Vietnam to solidarity with the black liberation<br />\nfighters to getting at the hypocrisy of educational and<br />\npolitical and economic system.<br />\nN-L: And you are calling yourselves the Conspiracy?<br />\nDELLINGER: Yes. This was a joint decision which<br />\nsymbolizes what I mean. Instead of calling it a defense<br />\ncommittee, which will try to get us off by legal<br />\ntechnicalities or what have you, we are saying that we do<br />\nwork together, we do work together to try to get rid of<br />\nwar, racism, and military and corporate power; to try to<br />\nput the individual, the human being, back into the<br />\ncenter of things; to try to establish a communitarian<br />\napproach to life and society.<br />\nSince we do believe in working together, and since<br />\nwe do believe in organized effort, and since we do<br />\nbelieve in the objectives we are working for, then<br /><br />\ndiversity as well as working together, and at its best that<br />\nwas a characteristic of the New Left which was verY<br />\nexciting.<br />\nIn the process of deepening its insights and<br />\nstruggling for new visions and analysing new areas, and<br />\nalso realizing that you couldn't just expose an evil and<br />\nthink there would be a moral revulsion and the problem<br />\nwould be solved, but in realizing that there was very<br />\nserious organizing and very serious sicrificing involved a<br />\nlot of people have tended to move away from diversity<br />\nand individualism. They think that there is a single<br />\ncorrect line, they want to find it and say \"our<br />\norganization has it\", and if it doesn't have it \"why can't<br />\nwe form a 'political party which will have the correct<br />\nsolution.\"<br />\nThere is a certain movement in the direction of a<br />\nkind of sterile unity, I think. I'm sure that given the<br />\nnature of the eight defendants in this case we wilUnever<br />\nachieve that kind of monolithic unity. But at this point<br />\nour strength is in the fact we have different<br />\ntemperments, different backgrounds, and in some areas<br />\neven different political interpretations. I don't want to<br />\npreserve diversity just for the sake of it, but as we unite<br />\non some things and make them central to our attitude,<br />\nthere will be new areas opening up in which we will have<br />\ndifferent patterns.<br />\nSo I am not at this point worried by the diversity.<br />\nIt can create some problems though. Particularly since<br />\nthe government, whatever its own contradictions are,<br />\nwill undoubtedly conduct a monolithic and<br />\ncomputerized attack on us. But that is one of the<br />\ndifferences between their life style and their life style.<br />\nAnd I would be very sorry if we presented some kind of<br />\nlowest common denominator approach to the thing. It<br />\nmay be very important to a person how he has his hair,<br />\nto Jerry for example, and that's right, but that is not the<br />\nthing we come together on, our hair style.<br />\nN-L: Do you see an increasing solidification on the right.<br />\na backlash?<br />\nDELLINGER: I think that the left, and liberals, and just<br />\ngood-hearted people who would like to see things<br />\nimprove, spend too much time worrying about the right.<br />\nWhen there is a vacuum, the right tends to fill it. Or<br />\nwhen the left is weak, then the right is encouraged to be<br />\nstronger.<br />\nBut I am more worried about creating a vacuum<br />\ninto which the right can move, than I am about creating<br />\na backlash by the vitality and the radicalism of the<br />\nactions that we take.<br />\nOur job is really to give people who are potential<br />\nconverts to the right something positive,<br />\nprogrammatically, a new life style, a real sense of<br />\ncommunity and solidarity which is attractive to them.<br />\n(Part II of this interview will appear next week.)<br /><br />\nPre<br />\nIll(<br />\nCo<br />\nuo<br />\nsea<br />\nsee<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\nIt,<br /><br />\nth(<br /><br />\nCo<br /><br />\nSc<br /><br />\nde]<br />\nbo<br />\nstc<br /><br />\nOf<br /><br />\n4C(<br />\nIC<br /><br />\nan,<br />\nAn<br />\nPr(<br /><br />\nrtn,<br />\nlOt<br /><br />\nwe<br />\nInc<br />\nreit<br />\nsub<br /><br />\nh<br />\nIC,<br />\ntee]<br />\nwo,<br /><br />\ncot]<br />\ntilt<br /><br />\nYs<br />\ninci<br /><br />\ntirn<br />\nfor<br /><br />\nlls,<br /><br />\nthe,<br />\nTIC(<br />\n6,e<br />\ntsf<br />\nadd<br /><br />\ninte<br /><br />\nlc<br />\n.44<br />\nOf \u00b0<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, APRIL 11,<br />\n1969<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAG1_,<br /><br />\nABM Threatens 'Mutual Deterrence<br />\nAnd Strategic Balance' With Russia<br />\nBy SENATOR CHARLES McC. MATHIAS<br />\nWe must understand that we are now living in an<br />\nage when increasing reliance on military force and the<br />\nPurchase of every new weapon may not contribute to<br />\nour , defense. Now, as never before, we must critically<br />\nexamine each and every suggestion on its merits, not<br />\nmerely because of the immense cost of today's weapons<br />\nsystems \u2014 cost which inevitably mean sacrificing some<br />\nother national goal. We must also be sure that the<br />\ndefenses we buy will indeed defend, and we must be sure<br />\nthat new defensive systems do not actually decrease our<br />\noverall security.<br />\n, Civilization that was millennia in the making can<br />\nne disintegrated in minutes.

For 23 years<br />\nhwe have survived in the nuclear age and in that time we<br />\naye learned that our own security \u2014 the success of our<br />\nclwn deterrence \u2014 requires us to have concern for the<br />\neeurity of our adversay, the Soviet Union, as well.<br />\nMutual Confidence<br />\nL Over time, and after appalling risks during the<br />\nt rlin and Cuban crises, we and the Soviets have both<br />\ntealized that for deterrence to succeed, for nuclear war<br />\ni\u00b0 be prevented, we must both feel a mutual confidence<br />\n1')Ithat deterrent. In short, for one of us to have security,<br />\nteith of us must have it. This is an inescapable<br />\nie,quirement if we are both to live in a world free from<br />\n`ne active threat of nuclear war.<br />\n\u201e, This conclusion is supported by the hard realities<br />\nthe nuclear arms race which stand out in stark and<br />\noold relief.<br />\nPro First, there is nothing that we can presently do to<br />\nthe Soviet Union from being able to attack us<br />\ncnd destroy our nation beyond recognition or repair.<br />\nriclitinued superiority in numbers of nuclear arms will<br />\nseN help us evade this reality,just as the Soviets' present<br />\narch for nuclear 'parity' will bring them no new<br />\n,<br />\n'eurity.<br />\nth Second, nothing which the Russians do,now or in<br />\nforeseeable future will enable them to launch a<br />\nt'iclear attack on us, and prevent us from destroying<br />\ncoe\u201e111 in return. No anti-ballistic missile system yet<br />\nsceived, no new weapon in development by the<br />\ns'ets, will enable them to escape this reality.<br />\ntie Third, security and survival in the nuclear age<br />\nboP\u201eend on mutual ,deterrence and mutual safety.

Only by preserving it can<br />\npi.'\"ericans and Russians begin to approach the political<br />\n114\u00b0,blems that divide us; to reduce the importance of<br />\nritilear weapons in the world; to lessen the risks that a<br />\n'<br />\nc ear war will begin despite ourselves; and to live in a<br />\nd not continually held hostage to fear.<br />\nReinforce Deterence<br />\nwe. Thus one of the standards which we must use in<br />\nitiellgiling each proposed strategic weapons system,<br />\ntei ticding the Sentinel, is whether its deployment would'<br />\nsliir3licIrce mutual deterrence, or undermine it without<br />\nstituting any reliable alternative.<br />\nt The Sentinel system, when completed, would be<br />\nach.<br />\nhe nlost difficult and impressive engineering<br />\nteehleve me n t in history, requiring the skills and<br />\nwu'iniques developed to send men to the moon. It<br />\ntop\u201euld embody two different sets of advanced radar,<br />\ncomputers and, if fully deployed, two missile<br />\nthoLenis meeting standards of reliability higher than<br />\nse for our offensive missile systems like Polaris and<br />\nsyslitutemen. Unlike Apollo, Polaris and Minuteman, this<br />\nioe eni would have to be in readiness to respond yvith<br />\nsin redible precision, accuracy and reliability at every<br />\ngle moment for a decade or more.<br />\ntit4 American industry and science, given sufficient<br />\nforeiand money, could certainly meet the standards set<br />\nthe Sentinel system. But that is not enough. We must<br />\n\u00b0<br />\nthe ask whether these standards of performance<br />\nfacInselves will actually make this system effective in the<br />\n:<br />\ntv of any enemy's determined efforts to counter it.<br />\ndein if Sentinel work's, will it really provide us with<br />\nadde.nse against nuclear attack? Or will it only pose an<br />\nniOnal threat to the stability of mutual deterrence?<br />\nirlte Defending successfully against an attack with<br />\n41 r-c0ntinental ballistic missiles, therefore, will require<br />\nstaevel of performance by the Sentinel system that is<br />\ngering to contemplate. A single failure in the course<br />\nclead,<br />\na nuclear attack could leave millions of Americans<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nFor several years we had thought of an ABM<br />\nsystem only as a defense against a pcssible attack by the<br />\nSoviet Union. The arguments against trying to defend<br />\nagainst such an attack were overwhelming then, and they<br />\nare overwhelming now. Quite simply, we know that no<br />\ndefense system yet conceived can .stop enough of the<br />\nmissiles launched against us to make such a prospect<br />\ntolerable. For each step that we might take to improve<br />\nour defenses, the Soviets could develop new ways of<br />\novercoming our new defenses. At the end of the spiral,<br />\nwe would be almost as vulnerable as before.<br />\nWisely, we decided not to proceed with missile<br />\ndefenses against the Soviet Union which would only<br />\nundermine each side's confidence in mutual deterrence.<br />\nToday we face a new and somewhat different<br />\nissue. During the next few years, China will probably<br />\ndevelop the ability to launch long-range missiles aimed at<br />\ntargets within the United States. By the mid-1970's we<br />\nmay face the prospect that China could attack us with a<br />\nnumber of ballistic missiles.<br />\nNo one can view this forecast with equanimity,<br />\nnor oppose whatever steps might be possible to protect<br />\nour nation against such an attack. But we must ask very<br />\ncarefully what the best way to do this would be.<br />\nWhen we evaluate the Sentinel syste i as a defense<br />\nagainst a Chinese attack, it is generally assumed that it<br />\nwould be effective only for a limited number of years,<br />\nwithin the decade from approximately the mid-seventies<br />\nto the mid-eighties.<br />\nAfter that \u2014 despite a current lage in Chinese<br />\nmissile development \u2014 improved Chinese offensive<br />\ncapabilities would goad us to rebuild, renew or replace<br /><br />\nSENATOR MATHIAS, speaking at Hopkins during _ last fall's<br />\ncampaign. Mathias states that we must find \"new ways to order<br />\nour relations\" with nations other than nuclear arms.<br /><br />\nthe system and could even make meaningful defense<br />\nimpossible.<br />\nThere are other risks involved in arming ourselves<br />\nwith even a limited form of defense against the Chinese.<br />\n.For one thing, technical uncertainties in trying to<br />\ns intercept incoming nuclear warheads are still<br />\n'considerable. We would never be sure of the<br />\n\u2022effectiveness of the Sentinel system \u2014 either as a total<br />\ndefense against China, or as a partial defense against the<br />\nSoviet Union \u2014 unless we undertook exhaustive tests of<br />\nthe full system. This would mean violating the limited<br />\ntest-ban treaty of 1963 by resuming full-scale testing of<br />\nnuclear weapons in the atmosphere. Such action would<br />\nbe irrevocable.<br />\nWe must also realize that projects like Sentinel,<br />\ndirected against the Chinese, will likely lead to greater<br />\nContinued to Page 10<br /><br />\n-Our American Heritage<br /><br />\n1 Easter Blessing: Calhoun Reborni<br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br /><br />\nSenator -Thomas Corwin of Ohio once said that<br />\n\"All the monuments of Earth are built over solemn<br />\nasses.\" This statement was doubtless influenced by the<br />\nfact that Senator Corwin wanted to be President, and<br />\ncame no closer to the Presidency than to the Papacy. He<br />\ndid not state an inviolable rule of history, since there has<br />\nbeen suitable recognition to such funloving spirits as<br />\nAbraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson and Fiorello<br />\nLaGuardia.<br />\nNevertheless, an overweening seriousness and the<br />\ntotal absence of humor may aid someone in being taken<br />\nseriously. This is partly indicated by Mr. Corwin's<br />\nbetter-known Senate colleague, John C. Calhoun.<br />\nMr. Calhoun received some approbation because,<br />\nwhile not a total abstainer, he did not drink alcohol to<br />\nexcess. A suitably gentlemanly Southerner such as<br />\nJefferson Davis could become inebriated on an early visit<br />\nto Washington, but Mr. Calhoun never relaxed himself to<br />\nthis extent.<br />\n\"Glorious Health\"<br />\nIt was also noted that Mr. Calhoun's extensive<br />\nwritings and speeches are as deadly serious as those of<br />\nJohn Stuart Mill. This is not to say that he never<br />\nemployed ridicule. On March 4, 1850, he said that the<br />\ncry of \"Union, Union, glorious Union!\" would no more<br />\nsave the Union than the cry of \"Health, health, glorious<br />\nhealth!\" on the part of a physician could save a<br />\ndangerously ill patient.<br />\nIn spite of this, Mr. Calhoun appears devoid of the<br />\nself-deprecating humor of Mr. Lincoln. There is no<br />\ndoubt of his wholly serious concept of himself.<br />\nIt is conceded that Mr. Calhoun was an unusually<br />\ncreative student of government. Political science studies<br />\nare often an extensive statement of what is; Mr. Calhoun<br />\nmoved beyond this point to formulate proposals for<br />\nradical changes. That all his changes were designed to<br />\nstrengthen the slave states at the expense of the Federal<br />\ngovernment definitely suggests that Mr. Calhoun was<br />\nmore a sectional politician than a disinterested scholar.<br />\nNevertheless, it might be interesting to consider two of<br />\nMr. Calhoun's more suggestive proposals.<br />\nAgainst The Tariff<br />\nThe best known, contained in the South Carolina<br />\nExposition and Protest of 1832, was ghostwritten by Mr.<br />\nCalhoun and presented as a report of a committee of the<br />\nstate legislature. Here Mr. Calhoun indicated that the<br />\nsame percentage of states that amends the Constitution<br />\nshould be required to approve Federal legislation; that is,<br />\nMr. Calhoun was not in agreement with the current<br />\ntarrif, and he theorized that if one-quarter of the states<br />\njoined in opposition to a Federal law, it could be<br />\ninvalidated.<br />\nAt the time the slave states and free states were<br />\ne ual in number so it w<br /><br />\nCalhoun to summon half of the predominantly<br />\nagricultural slave states in opposition to a protective<br />\ntariff. Mr. Calhoun purported to demonstrate that all the<br />\nstates were sovereign commonwealths, that they had not<br />\nsurrendered their sovereignty upon joining the Union,<br />\nand that they therefore could exercise sovereignty.<br />\nUnlike Lucius Q.C. Lamar at a later time, he drew<br />\nno distinction between the thirteen original states, which<br />\ndid predate the Union, and later states, which had never<br />\nexisted as sovereign commonwealths outside the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nSelf-Contained Liquidation<br />\nActually, the states sacrificed a great deal of<br />\nsovereignty upon joining the Union, including the power<br />\nto declare war, issue currency, maintain Post Offices,<br />\nestablish tariffs in interstate or international commerce,<br />\n' and some others.<br />\nBeyond this, Mr. Calhoun believed that the<br />\nExposition's theory, that South Carolina could establish<br />\nitself as an independent republic if coerced to respect<br />\nFederal laws, was in accord' with the spirit of the<br />\nConstitution. Thus we are asked to believe that the<br />\nConstitution contains the seeds of its own liquidation;<br />\nthat it is, in the words of President Jackson, \"an airy<br />\nnothing,a bubble\" that must burst when criticized. It is<br />\ndifficult to believe that those who sought \"a more<br />\nperfect Union\" thought it would be more perfect if<br />\ncongenitally ephemeral.<br />\nAnother interesting theory was formulated by Mr.<br />\nCalhoun's last great Senate speech, read by Senator<br />\nMason of Virginia for an ailing Calhoun on March 4,<br />\n1850. Here Mr. Calhoun suggested a division of the<br />\nFederal Executive between one man from each section.<br />\nHe suggested that one might handle domestic matters<br />\nand the second might handle foreign affairs, but that the<br />\nimportant point was to have each section represented in<br />\nthe Executive branch.<br />\nSolid South Unprotected<br />\nOnce again, Mr. Calhoun's learned political<br />\ndiscourse has a sectional purpose. He wanted to insure<br />\nthat an equal official would be on hand to act as a check<br />\nagainst a pro-Northern President. Since the North had<br />\npulled ahead in popular and electoral votes, and<br />\nconceivably could control future Presidential elections,<br />\nMr. Calhoun felt that only extraordinary measures could<br />\nprotect Southern interests. Indeed his fears would be<br />\njustified by the election of 1860, in which a nearly Solid<br />\nNorth outvoted a nearly Solid South.<br />\nIn moral terms, Mr. Calhoun's declaration that<br />\n\"slavery is a positive good\" may appear abhorrent.<br />\nHowever, Mr. Calhoun definitely held his own when<br />\ndebating his position. In 1832, and again during the Civil<br />\nWar, a radical states' rights doctrine was overturned only<br />\nb Federal threats or a.

There are serious diplomatic and<br />\ndomestic problems, as well. To begin with, it has been<br />\nargued that Sentinel will increase the Russians' incentive<br />\nto talk about arms control, covering a comprehensive list<br />\nof offensive and defensive systems. I believe that these<br />\ntalks should take place, but I am not convinced that<br />\nSentinel will help us in bargaining with the Russians on<br />\nthese delicate and crucial matters. To the contrary, past<br />\nexperience \u2014 as with the bomber and missile gaps \u2014<br />\nindicates that any step, however, minor, taken to upset<br />\nthe strategic balance will only decrease the chances for<br />\nmeaningful discussions.<br />\nDuring the past few years, strategic stability has..<br />\npermitted a certain relaxation of tensions in our<br />\nrelations with the Soviet Union. I do not suggest that<br />\nour real conflicts of interest have been resolved, or that<br />\nthey will be resolved in the near future. But we have had<br />\na period of relative relaxation, and have taken the first<br />\ntentative steps back from the nuclear abyss \u2014 with the<br />\nlimited test-ban treaty. The hot-line between Washington<br />\nand Moscow, and our mutual efforts to prevent the<br />\nspread of nuclear weapons. But if we lose our present<br />\nconfidence in strategic stability and mutual deterrence,<br />\nwe will invite a new period of disagreement with the<br />\nSoviet Union even on matters of crucial importance to<br />\nus both \u2014 including issues affecting the prospects for<br />\nnuclear war.<br />\nFurthermore, beginning talks with the Soviet<br />\nUnion on an end to the arms race, as well as forswearing<br />\nnew strategic nuclear programs, may be the price of<br />\npreventing the spread of nuclear weapons to many<br />\nnations not now possessing them. Several counties have<br />\nalready declared that their support for the<br />\nnon-proliferation treaty is conditional on a show of<br />\nself-restraint by the Soviet Union and the United States.<br />\nThese diplomatic factors, as well as reasons of<br />\nstrategy, argue against deployment of the Sentinel<br />\nsystem at this time. Thereis also its high cost. I have said<br />\nthat cost must be no object where the security of the<br />\nUnited States is at stake. But where a program, such as<br />\nSentinel and its varients, is of unproven merit \u2014 and may<br />\nactually be of real harm \u2014 we must look at the economic<br />\nfactor.<br />\nWe are now facing grave problems in this country,<br />\nwith urgent demands for money to combat poverty,<br />\ncurb crime, and meet the crises of blight in our cities. We<br />\nneed to invest our resources in those things which will<br />\nmost enrich and enhance our lives and those of our<br /><br />\nContinued from Page 9<br /><br />\nChinese isolation and undermine our efforts to bring<br />\nChina into the international community.<br />\nBut there is a far graver risk. For in the process of<br />\nbuilding defenses against Chinese missile attack \u2014<br />\ndefenses of limited value \u2014 we would run the risk of<br />\nconfusing our strategic relations with the Soviet Union.<br />\nCurrent debate makes it clear that, strategically,<br />\ndiplomatically and psychologically, it is almost<br />\nimpossible for us \u2014 or the rest of the world \u2014 to<br />\ndistinguish with perfect clarity between an ABM system<br />\non guard against Red China and one focused on the<br />\nSoviet Union. Obviously, any Sentinel system designed<br />\nto counter a Chinese attack could also be used to<br />\nintercept some of the Russian missiles that could be<br />\nlaunched against us. As we improved the Sentinel to<br />\ncope with more sophisticated Chinese missile<br />\ncapabilities, we could raise growing doubts in Moscow<br />\nboth about our own intentions and about the stability of<br />\nmutual deterrence.<br />\nThe possibilities for misunderstanding by Moscow<br />\nare already vast. They will be multiplied if we proceed<br />\nwith deployment of even the most limited ABM system.<br />\nAnd the risk of such a misunderstanding is one which,in<br />\nmy judgment, we can ill afford.<br />\nThere is serious concern in the United States that<br />\nthe Soviet Union does not share our caution; after all,<br />\nthey and not we have initiated the construction of<br />\nanti-ballistic missiles. But we must examine closely just<br />\nwhat the Russians have been doing. In the first place,<br />\ntheir ABM system is a limited one,providing protection<br />\nonly for one city, Moscow. Second, their system is far<br />\nless sophisticated than the Sentinel would be, and<br />\nconsequently more subject to counter-measures. Third,<br />\nthe Russians themselves appear to have recognized the<br />\nweaknesses of their ABM system, just as we are<br />\nrecognizing the potential weaknesses of our own<br />\nproposals. In fact, they have slowed or stopped work on<br />\nthe defensive system deployed around Moscow.<br />\nI do not argue that we should rely on the Soviet<br />\nUnion's good faith. No rational security policy can be<br />\nbased on anything but the strongest, surest efforts to<br />\nprovide for our own security. But we can test the<br />\nRussians' restraint, at relatively little cost to ourselves.<br />\nWe can, to begin with, continue to equip our leaders<br />\nwith the most sophisticated of intelligence-gathering<br />\ndevices, including \"spy-in-the-sky\" satellites, so that we<br />\nwill know at any moment the status of offensive and<br />\ndefensive missile deployment in the Soviet Union and, of<br />\ncourse, in China.<br /><br />\nneighbors. But if we spend billions of dollars on sha<br />\nsystems which we may not need, We will have less for<br />\nthose challenges of urgent priority. Unless we are<br />\ncareful, the inertia of government spending \u2014 that<br />\ncreeping condition against which we in Congress wage,'<br />\ncontinual but often unavailing struggle \u2014 will set in an<br />\ncarry the Sentinel's costs beyond our control. If we are<br />\nto prevent this inertia from taking command, we must<br />\nexert ourselves now.<br />\nFinally, there is a fundamental problem, th,e<br />\nquestion of our attitudes concerning the role of forcell!<br />\nsecurity, and the role of weapons in the conduct 01<br />\ndiplomacy. For many years I have been concerned bY,<br />\nwhat I believe is our tendency to look at problems ot<br />\nmilitary policy without considering the related questions<br />\nof diplomacy and the securing of peace through political<br />\nmeans. We must not delude ourselves: in the long run,'<br />\nwe must deal with our adversaries on political an'<br />\nhuman levels as well as on the military plane. We can n\u00b0<br />\nlonger hide beyond the oceans, nor will we be able 10<br />\nhide behind a screen of missile defenses which do not<br />\nwork.<br />\nFortunately, we have learned some lessons in efirtil<br />\ndealings with our chief adversary, the Soviet Union.<br />\nhave had modest successes in making the world a safe!,<br />\n)lace, and in exercising a mutual caution and rrlutt?wA<br />\ntrust. As a result, the specter of nuclear war has recedeu<br />\na little way farther from us. We must not lose the chance<br />\nto carry on with these developments, including talks<br />\nwith the Soviet Union to end the nuclear arms race.<br />\nFor all these reasons, I reaffirm the conclusil<br />\nthat I formed and acted upon last year as a member \u00b0<br />\nthe other body. On the basis of all of the informati\u00b0,111<br />\navailable to me, it is still my view that a limited All<br />\nsystem should not be deployed at this time.<br />\nIn the longer run, we must continue our search f\u00b0I<br />\nnew ways to order our relations with other nations;<br />\nways that'do not depend upon the power of nueltead<br />\nweapons to deter, nor require the piling up of urinal,<br />\nweapons systems. Peace will be won by men, not,<br />\nmissiles or machines. It will be achieved by a Pat'e\"d<br />\nprocess of political effort, not by the unconsidere<br />\npurchase of new,complex military hardware.<br />\nWe must never neglect the hard demands of \u00b0Iiti<br />\n3e<br />\nown sure defense. But we must also not lose W11,<br />\nchances we have to lessen the uncertainities of<br />\nnuclear age, and advance the search for lasting peace.<br /><br />\nGEORGE WEIN Presents. the 16th Annual<br /><br />\nNEWPORT jAkii USTIVIL<br />\nJuly 3 thru July 6, 1969<br />\nAt Festival Field \u2022 Newport, Rhode Island<br />\nFour Evening Concerts \u2014 Thursday: For the Jazz Aficionado \u2014 Willie<br />\nBobo, Kenny Burrell, Bill Evans/Jeremy Steig, Young-Holt Unlimited,<br />\nFreddie Hubbard, Sonny Murray, Anita O'Day, Sun Ra, and others.<br />\nFriday: An Evening of Jazz-Rock \u2014 Jeff Beck, Blood, Sweat and Tears,<br />\nRoland Kirk, Steve Marcus, Ten Years After, Jethro Tull; and others.<br />\nSaturday: Dave Brubeck/Gerry Mulligan, Woody Herman, Sly and the<br />\nFamily Stone, 0.

The<br />\norganizers had brought together 100,00, the Police<br />\nhandled 20,000, and the Press reported 50,000. Believe<br />\nthe lie of your choice, had you been there the numbers<br />\nwouldn't have mattered. The war ended today. It had<br />\nbeen a long war to end the war, and the mass illusion<br />\nwas that peace was won. There were no questions left<br />\nfor the demonstrators, Vietnam was left to claim the<br />\nlives and loyalties of a diminishing number of blind<br />\nfanatics. The Pentagon and friends waft a stench that<br />\ndwarfs the rest of America's pollution\u2014the opinion was<br />\nunanimous. The world looked good in April's pouring<br />\nrain as you went deaft and blind with the word \"Peace\".<br />\nEaster Sunday\u2014it just happened here. There had<br />\nbeen that flurry, and then the grand blitzkreig of<br />\nmediocrity. There was a hole on at 9 o'clock, CBS. The<br />\nSmothers Brothers Cancellation Hour. The hell with the<br />\nquality of the show. That's as irrelevant as the official<br />\nreason for the cancellation. The show wasn't important?<br />\nCan't you see! The Cancellation is victory of an all<br />\npervasive deadening coercion. There is somebody in this<br />\ncountry who dares to tell you what it is proper for you<br />\nto see. Can't you see! You can't see. You are being<br />\nkicked in the teeth. For censorship isn't a ruling, isn't a.<br />\ndecision or a law.<br />\nCensorship is a principle, the idea that somebody<br />\nknows better. Censorship is not a passing manifestation<br />\nof authoritarianism. It lies at the very core of the<br />\nuniversal ideology of human belittlement. To control a<br />\nhuman being's perceptual intake is to smother his will,<br />\nhis intelligence, his individuality, everything that defines<br />\nhim as a man. To acquiesce in the suppression of one<br />\nidea is to renounce 10,000 years of human expression,<br />\nor was it only 5000, the 1960's, or perhaps only that<br />\nhour on television that wasn't. More magic numbers.<br />\nDeath is Living<br />\nAnd it isn't a matter of force. If there were only a<br />\nN4ayor Daley, only the blatant pigs, only the army, only<br />\nthe State Department and the blood-lust military<br />\nContractors, if it were only these killers and their dupes<br />\nthere would not be ten minutes standing between<br />\nhumanity and its fulfillment.<br />\nIf there were only bigotry, only hate, only the<br />\ninire of tradition's shackles, only religion, the agent of<br />\ninter-generational coersion, there would still be a better<br />\nthan fighting chance. The Movement is wrong; death is<br />\nmore. Death is propriety, death is acceptance, death is<br />\nliving the \"right sort of life.\"<br />\nThe polarization then is not between left and<br />\nright, new and old, conformists and the defiant. The<br />\nPolarization is between life and death. Life can accept all<br />\nexpression, death cannot. Censorship is a death wish, a<br />\ndesire to close the eyes and not...<br />\nMore. Life has.as its purpose the propagation of<br />\nlife. To accept that purpose is to be in harmony with a<br />\nuniversal law, the law being that each force, each true<br />\nentity exists only to propagate itself.' Death propagates<br />\nOnly death, albeit death disguised as sacrifice. To die for<br />\nanything, anything at all, is ultimately to die for death<br />\nitself.<br />\nAnd more. Life demands no justification other<br /><br />\nthan itself. Life lures more life with raw life. Death lures<br />\ndeath with purposes and crusades, twisted arguments<br />\nthat come out nowere but death.<br />\nStill more. Death waits, life does not.<br />\nMonday\u2014and what else is there to say? You can't<br />\nwin converts to this kind of thing. You either side with<br />\nlife or death. You either accept life as the purposeless<br />\npropagation of itself, and rejoice in your acceptance, or<br />\nyou follow one of the excuses of death. You fight to be<br />\nalive, you fight to experience all that you can grasp.<br />\nDeath is repugnant because it wastes your time. Death's<br />\nrules, death's inhibititions, death's causes and crusades<br />\nstand between the human being and his inalienable right<br />\nto perception.<br />\nToday is a standoff, modeled along the lines of<br />\nKennan's containment principles. The lesson of the '60's<br />\nis that the forces of life must organize to counter the<br />\nforces of death. Civil rights groups built fortresses<br />\nagainst racism, peace groups fight the draft, even public<br />\nschool kids in New York have had to organize to defend<br />\nthemselves against impingements on their school<br />\nvacations.<br />\nNot Afraid To Live<br />\nLife, banding together has stalemated death and<br />\nnow death will begin to turn on itself. Television will eat<br />\nitself up in a frenzy of paranoid self-censorship until no<br />\nshow can compete with the interest generated by a test<br />\npattern. The great crusades will end in a thousand<br />\nDienbienphues, and the leaders of the crusades will<br />\nconsume themselves in witch-hunting. (life is organized,<br />\nit will refuse to testify in the post-Vietnam Red Scare,<br />\nleaving only the militarists as sacrificial lambs). ln short,<br />\nthere is a core of desire in this country forming an<br />\nimpregnable nexus of life.

APRIL 11, 1969<br /><br />\nDistrict Judge Attacks Congressional CO.Ruling<br />\n(CPS)\u2014The ruling last week by a Federal<br />\nJudge that the Selective Service Act<br />\n\"unconstitutionally discriminates\" against<br />\nnon-religious conscientious objectors sets the<br />\nstage for a review of the 1967 draft law by the<br />\nU.S. Supreme Court.<br />\nIf the high court upholds the decision by U.S.<br />\nDistrict Judge Charles E. Wyzanski, atheists, agnostics<br />\nand others religious or not\u2014would be entitled to<br />\nexemption from the draft if they oppose war for<br />\nprofound moral reasons.<br />\nObjection to war must now be based on \"religious<br />\ntraining and belief.\" The Supreme Court in 1965 offered<br />\na broad definition of that term, but Congress, in 1967,<br />\naltered the law to exclude non-religious C.O.'s.<br />\nSo the issue now returns to the high court, if the<br />\nJustice Department decides to appeal the Wyzanski<br />\ndeicision. The prosecutor for the case said he would<br />\nrecommend an appeal, but Justice officials in<br />\nWashington say they won't decide on further action<br />\nuntil the case is reviewed within the next thirty days.<br />\nHarvard Grad<br />\nThe case will come to be known as the Sisson, 22,<br />\nwho had been convicted for refusing induction into the<br />\narmed forces. Sisson, a Harvard graduate and former<br />\nPeace Corps volunteer, had sought a C.O. deferment<br />\nuntil he learned the narrow religious restriction.<br />\nTechnically, his conviction was not overturned.<br />\nJudge Wyzanski merely issued an arrest in judgement,<br />\nstarying the sentence and allowing for a quicker appeal.<br />\nSisson could have been fined $10,000 and sentenced to<br />\nrive years in prison.<br />\nIn his 21-page opinion, the judge commented: \"In<br />\nthe draft act, Congress unconstitutionally discriminated<br />\n, against atheists, agnostics, and men, like Sisson, who,<br />\nwhether they be religiously motivated or not, are<br />\nmotivated in their objection to the draft by profound<br />\nmoral beliefs which constitute the central convictions of<br />\ntheir beings.\"<br />\nThe decision said that, in the absence of a direct<br />\nthreat to national survival, an individual's conscience can<br />\ntake precedence over the authority of the state. An<br /><br />\nindividual's conscience is recognized as being on a par<br />\nwith traditional concepts of religion.<br />\n\"Selective\" Objection<br />\n\"Selective\" conscientious objection is also upheld<br />\nin the ruling. The judge disposed of the charge that<br />\n\u00b0objections to one war but not others would open a<br />\n, floodgate of spurious claims for exemption. At the heart<br />\n. of the matter is an individual's sincerity, which can be<br />\njudged in the courts, the judge said.<br />\nThe ruling said the 1967 draft act violated the<br />\nprovision of the first amendment prohibiting laws<br />\ni\"respecting an establishment of religion.\" It called the<br />\n'Sisson case \"a clash between law and morality,\" and<br />\nwarned that ',when the state, through its laws, seeks to<br />\noverride reasonable moral commitments, it makes a<br /><br />\ndangerously uncharacteristic choice. The law grows from<br />\nthe deposits of morality.\"<br />\n\"When the law treats a reasonable, conscientious<br />\nact as a crime, it subverts its own power. It invited civil<br />\ndisobedience,\" the decision continued.<br />\nA similar case is now pending before the Supreme<br />\nCourt. A Los Angeles computer engineer who contends<br />\nthe C.O. provision was applied improperly to him is<br />\n'waiting to see if the high court\u2022will hear his appeal. A<br />\n'Federal district judge in Baltimore ruled in early<br />\nDecember that an atheist who believes killing is an<br />\nunendurable sin can qualify for a C.O. exemption. That<br />\nruling was based on the 1965 Seeger case, which<br />\noriginally broadened the definition of conscientious<br />\nobjection.<br /><br />\nCISF Concludes Study, Advises Change<br />\nThe Committee for Improving Student<br />\nFacilities has concluded a survey of the Hopkins<br />\nstudent body, initiated near the beginning of the<br />\nsemester, concerning the role of the univeristy in<br />\ngeneral, and the success of Hopkins in particular<br />\nin fulfilling these needs.<br />\nResponse to the survey was much heavier than<br />\nexpected, and many of the respondeeschose to elaborate<br />\non their answers. An overwhelming 86% responded that<br />\nthe university has a responsibility to provide<br />\n\"non-academic facilities.\" 90% felt that a university<br />\nshould have \"a sense of community.\" The concensus felt<br />\nthat inter-level communication on campus is<br />\n\"unsatisfactory.\" \"Education is a joint effort by the<br />\nentire academic community. It pervades into every<br />\naspect of an individuals life and is dependent upon<br />\nintercommunication. Only in a viable community can<br />\nthis occur,\" one CISF member concluded.<br />\nMany people complained of the apathy and lack of<br />\na sense of group direction. A center, where students and<br />\nfaculty can informally get together was indicated as a<br />\nmajor step in this direction. 62% of the respondents<br />\nwrote in of the need for a student union, even though no<br />\nmention of a student union was made on the<br />\nquestionaire. Many asked fora place for social gatherings<br /><br />\non campus. Others wanted somewhere to go to get<br />\nbetter acquainted with fellow students. 23% specifically<br />\nwrote of the \"inadequate service\" at the snack bar, and<br />\nits lack of feasability as a \"gathering place.\" Other<br />\nrequests included a student operated theatre hall, more<br />\nand better concerts, more frequent servicing of the<br />\nvending machines, especially in the dorms, increased<br />\nlaundry facilities, and more gym lockers.<br />\nMaking Plans<br />\nThe CISF has made plans and initiated action on<br />\nthe points raised in the questionnaire. The Hopkins<br />\nadministration is already reported to be considering for<br />\ninclusion in the budget the CISF-DSRC proposal to<br />\ncompletely renovate the snack bar area. Also included in<br />\nthe University's plans are increased parking facilities, and<br />\nan application to HUD for funds to purchase additional<br />\nundergraduate housing.<br />\nSaid one CISF spokesman, \"These programs are<br />\nnot sufficient. Hopkins can only become a cohesive<br />\ncommunity when it has central facilities for informal<br />\nmeetings. Only then can the interaction so necessary for<br />\na viable educational community begin to take root on<br />\nthis fragmented campus.\"<br />\n,t\u2022<br /><br />\nPutting you first, keeps us first.<br /><br />\nGM<br />\nKOK OF \u201cCtlithcf<br /><br />\nY<br /><br />\nGlf yOu're<br />\nthinking of the<br />\ncReligious<br /><br />\ngo<br /><br />\nOreStep<br />\nPurther<br />\nIf you arc seriously thinking<br />\nof the priesthood, the question becomes not \"what\" hut<br />\n\"who.\"<br />\nWho can allow you to utilize<br />\n}oul' 'own innate talc:ill..?<br />\nWho is most amine(' to otir<br />\ntime.?

Yet, he comes!<br />\nfrom a very sports-minded family.<br />\nHis father is athletic director at<br />\nthe Seaford Long Island High<br />\nSchool where Jim captained the<br />\nfootball, basketball and baseball<br />\nteams his senior year. From his<br />\nbroad-based education, he has<br />\nalways considered coaching -as a<br />\ncareer. For the past two years<br />\nafter his graduation from Rutgers,<br />\nhe has coached the Rutger's<br />\nfreshman team to a 20-11 record.<br />\nThe record is deceiving of this<br />\nman's knowledge and teaching<br />\nability of the game.<br /><br />\nAftido<br /><br />\nCOACH VALVANO<br />\nAt Rutgers under Coach Bill Foster's tutelage,<br />\nValvano\u2014co-captain of the 1967 quintet which finished third in the<br />\nNIT\u2014learned that the purpose of the freshman team was to develop<br />\ntalent for the varsity and not just to win ball games. The success of<br />\nthe varsity and the basketball program, in general, at Rutgers is<br />\ntestimony to this.<br />\nValvano Visits Campus<br />\nOn March 28th, Coach Valvano was on campus to talk to the<br />\nbasketball players and the coaches in the athletic department. I had<br />\na few moments to talk to him about his basic basketball philosophy.<br />\nAlthough he does not favor such methods as the Army slow-down<br />\ntechnique of defensive basketball, Valvano affirms that he is a<br />\ndefensively oriented coach.\"You can have an off-night offensively,<br />\nbut you never should on defense.\"<br />\nA strong advocate of man-to-man defense, Coach Valvano<br />\nbelieves in \"basic basketball with variety\" such as the \"monster\"<br />\ndefense lie used at Rutgers. This ia a combination man-to-man and<br />\nzone defense. Nevertheless, Valvano realized that he has to get to<br />\nknow his personnel before he makes definite plans or predictions. He<br />\nis out to do his best and we hope that not only the players but also<br />\nthe fans will support him and his team whole-heartedly.<br />\nAbout recruiting, Coach Valvano recognized that the<br />\nUniversity sets the tone and that his job is first to sell the academics<br />\nto prospective scholar-athletes and number two the basketball<br />\nprogram at Hopkins. He is looking for the scholar-athlete at all<br />\ntimes. His contacts in New Jersey and on the Island should supply<br />\nthe necessary talent to build a winner.<br />\nIn the conclusion of my interview, I asked him about his<br />\nphilosophy of player- coach relations. He said that he'd been very<br />\nfortunate in having a close relationship with his coach Bill Foster at<br />\nRutgers. He hopes that the same kind of rapport can be continued at<br />\nHopkins. From the few minutes, I don't see how he can fail in this<br />\nregard.<br />\nViewed By Past Mentor<br />\nIn the eyes of his former coach\u2014Bill Foster\u2014he has<br />\n\"tremendous potential\". Although young, he has better knowledge<br />\nof the game than anyone else the Hop could find. In the words of<br />\nMarshall Turner, \"We've selected the appropriate person to give<br />\nbasketball a new look at Hopkins.\" Mr. Turner mentioned Valvano's<br />\nenthusiasm and potential before adding that he was impressed with<br />\nCoach Valvano's approach to physical education and student<br />\nrelations. \"He's done a good job of recruiting and getting along with<br />\nthe students at Rutgers.\" To reenforce Turner's praise, \"Coach<br />\nValvano is a real diamond in the rough.\"<br />\nWe applaud Valvano's selection as head basketball coach to<br />\nreplace the resigning Henry Ciccerone. It is our hope that the<br />\nHopkins athletic situation will improve sO that like other young,<br />\noutstanding coaches in the past, Coach Valvano will not feel<br />\ncompelled to seek greener pastures. Although it is a wild fantasy at<br />\npresent, maybe someday Coach Valvano will be able to return to the<br />\nNIT as mentor of the Blue Jay Varsity. Along with Coach Valvano,<br />\nwe look forward to the future basketball successes at Hopkins under<br />\nhis energetic, youthful guidance.<br /><br />\nWarming up for their confrontation<br />\nwith an undefeated Virginia, the Hopkins<br />\nBlue Jays beat their three vacation<br />\nopponents with relative ease. For only the<br />\nsecond time in the last twenty-nine years,<br />\nbut for the second time in the last three,<br />\nthe Hopkins Stickmen stunned Mt.<br />\nWashington's once feared Wolfpack by a<br />\nscore of 10-4.<br />\nThe Wolfpack's Gene Fusting opened the<br />\nscoring on an assist from former Hopkins great<br />\nLucky Mallonee at 3:22 of the first quarter.<br />\nHowever, a goal by All-American Joe Cowan at<br />\n6:46 of the same quarter knotted the score and<br />\nthereafter the Jays were in control. The Blue<br />\nJays sprung into the lead on Stu Kahl's first goal<br />\nwith an assist by Cowan while three more goals<br />\nby Big Tuna Latson, the incomparable Cowan,<br />\nand speedster Charlie Coker more than offset an<br />\nadditional clinger by the Mounties to set the half<br />\ntime score at 5-2. From this point on, it was a<br />\nquestion of how badly the Jays would beat their<br />\nformer nemesis with Stu Kahl netting two more<br />\ngoals, Phil Buck a beautiful score on. a broken<br />\nclear, Cowan slipping the ball past a brilliant<br />\nBrian Poole on a one on one, and a fired up<br />\nCharlie Coker firing for daylight on a perfect<br />\nassist from Jim Feely. Then, there followed a<br />\nHopkins first when Coach Scott substituted<br />\nfreely against Mt. Washington - something no one<br />\nhad seen for many a season.<br />\nJoe Cowan's three goal and three assist<br />\nperformance against the Wolfpack netted him<br />\none of the game balls. However, it appeared he<br />\nwas only being easy on the oldtimers - scoring 4<br />\ngoals and4assists against Washington College.<br />\nHowever, after a fine first quarter in which the<br />\nBlue Jays scored only 4 times on the strength of<br />\n24 shots, there appeared to be a let down, as the<br />\nfired up stickmen from the Eastern Shore rang<br />\nthe bell three times in the second period to only<br />\none score by Hopkins - a rebound by Whit<br />\nHolden. Playing particularly brilliantly in the<br />\nfirst half was the Washington College goalie, Dave<br />\nBoulden, who at times appeared to measure 6<br />\nfeet by 6 feet.<br />\nScott Sparks Performance<br />\nScott must have said something to the<br />\ngroggy Jays, for after running out onto the field<br />\nat half time, they scored three goals in one<br />\nminute and 43 seconds to appear to put the game<br />\nout of reach. Yet, their stubborn opponents,<br />\napparently not cowed in the slightest by the<br />\nreturn of the Hopkins flashy championship form,<br />\nthen scored three more on their own with tallies<br />\nby Mueller and Regan. Jimmie Feely and Charlie<br />\nGoodell rose to meet this latest challenge - each<br />\nfooling a now tiring Boulden before the third<br />\nquarter ended. Thereafter, the Jays coasted on<br />\nshots by Goodell once more, Cowan, and a now<br />\nhot Jim Feely who finished the day with three<br />\ngoals and two assists.<br />\nHowever, the overall Blue Jay<br />\nperformance, against a team missing two starting<br />\nattackmen and running only two real midfields,<br />\nwas not overwhelming. Hopkins could certainly<br />\nnot look forward to pulling the tiger's tail three<br />\ndays later unless its lethargic style suddenly<br />\npicked up a few beats.<br />\nWhen Princeton opened the scoring at 2;56<br />\non an extra man play with almost ridiculous ease,<br />\nit appeared that last year's champions had still<br />\nnot come back to earth. However, at 5:40 Joe<br />\nCowan fed Charlie Goodell who proceeded to<br />\nembarass Princeton goalie and thereafter Hopkins<br />\nnever trailed. Charlie Coker, trying to forget a<br />\ndrive against Washington College where he ended<br />\nin the goal instead of the ball, roll-dodged his<br />\nopponent with such finesse that the poor fellow<br />\nended up running on his hands backward. Coker<br />\nthen dodged a few more Tigers and gently placed<br />\nthe ball in the nets to give Hopkins a 2-1 lead<br />\nwith 7:34 gone in the first quarter.<br />\nIt was in the second quarter that the Blue\u2022<br /><br />\nJays began to evidence their old form. Kahl<br />\nscored twice, while Cowan and Bill Donovan on a<br />\npicture book shot to the far corner on a left-hand<br />\ndrive, also upped the score. Princeton's lone goal<br />\nleft the contest at 6-3 at half time. Not forgetting<br />\nthe dramatic burst of Wednesday, the Jays<br />\nblitzed the now kittenish Tigers in the third<br />\nperiod - out-playing them to the tune of 5-1 on a<br />\nsmart defense and aggressive offense. As last<br />\nyear, the Hopkins defense was taken for granted.<br />\nHowever, Coach Scott had awarded game balls to<br />\ntwo of the starting trio of Clark, Cardillo, and<br />\nWeiss over vacation - showing all of you readers<br />\njust where the smart money is.<br />\nBack to the action, Cowan started the blitz<br />\non an unassisted goal at 1:04 of the quarter, and<br />\nwas soon copied by a hungry Charlie Coker(who<br />\nfell victim to fate with two pipe shots later in the<br />\nday), an awesome stinger from the cannon of<br />\nPhil Buck, and skilled accuracy shots from Huge<br />\nTuna Latson and the irrepresible Charlie Goodell,<br />\nwho appeared to have drawn his inspiration from<br />\nwearing his old Severn pants in practice.<br />\nIndeed, so impressive had the Blue Jays<br />\nshowing been, that Coach Scott emptied the<br />\nbench with only a couple of minutes gone in the<br />\nquarter. As Coach Thompson of Princeton<br />\ngloated in glee, his boys proceeded to pump in<br />\nthree quick goals and were only held in check<br />\nwhen Scott hurridly sent back his first-stringer<br />\nwith half the period to go. Before Cowan (who<br />\nelse?) scored at 14:31 on an assist from Feely,<br />\nthere were quite a few tense moments with the<br />\ncrowd loving it all the way.<br />\nThus, the team emerged victorious from a<br />\nfull vacation schedule ready to play host to the<br />\nhottest team in the nation: the much improved<br />\nVirginia Cavaliers. There is no doubt that if they<br />\nplay as in the third quarter against Princeton,<br />\nCoach Beardmore's boys will .cool down a little,<br />\nbut I keep having nightmares about the second<br />\nquarter against Washington College.<br />\nNews-Letter predicts: Hopkins 12, Virginia 6.<br /><br />\nFrosh Track Team<br />\nStrongest in Years<br />\nFollowing last year's six-man team, Coach<br />\nDon Masken and Varsity Co-Captains Al<br />\nGoldberg and Paul Carlson decided that such a<br />\ndebacle was not to happen again. Thus, an active<br />\nrecruiting program among resident freshmen with<br />\ntrack experience and/or track enthusiasm was<br />\ninstituted. In addition, a winter conditioning<br />\nprogram was well-attended, particularly by the<br />\nfreshmen.

ESTIS<br />\nFour years ago, the only winter sport<br />\nWhich people ever spoke about was basketball.<br />\nFour years ago, the swimming team was just<br />\ngetting organized, but the wrestling team had<br />\nbeen here for a long time. The grapplers weren't<br />\nexpected to win and for a time in the 1950's<br />\nthey were relegated to the status of a club team<br />\nbecause of the lack of interest by the<br />\nundergraduate student body.<br />\nBut that was four years ago, when the Blue Jays<br />\nachieved a 3-6 record and appeared destined to remain in<br />\nthe ranks of the losers. In 1966, however, something was<br />\ndifferent on the grappler team. That difference was a<br />\nYoung coach who had recently graduated from Wayne<br />\nState University in Michigan and had only one year of<br />\ncoaching experience. The young coach learned quickly<br />\nand so did his charges. In three years, Kyle Smith has<br />\nmade people take notice of the grapplers, finishing this<br />\nseason with an 8-3 record. That same coach is leaving<br />\nHopkins at the end of this semester.<br />\nWhy would such a relatively successful individual<br />\ndecide suddenly to leave Hopkins and seek a career in<br />\nthe field of business? One wonders how anyone<br />\nwho has<br />\nbeen so completely involved in an activity and a school<br />\nCould choose to sell emblems, rather than continue<br />\n,c\u00b0aching? We might ask Coach Ciccarone who is also<br />\nleaving or the several other coaches who have remained<br />\nat Hopkins<br />\nfor a very short time and then sought careers<br />\nelsewhere<br />\nNeed for Family Life<br />\nTheir personal reasons may differ to an extent.<br />\nCoach Smith has two children and is originally from<br /><br />\nDetroit, Michigan. His two sons see him only rarely, and<br />\nhis wife has little opportunity to make new friends in<br />\nBaltimore with her husband occupied with Hopkins<br />\nathletics six days a week. I wonder how - nany of<br />\nHopkins' administration or faculty would be willing to<br />\nput in the same amount of time for the \"glory\" of the<br />\nBlue Jays.<br />\nPutting personal reasons aside, the major factor<br />\nwhich enters into the picture of the Hopkins coach is<br /><br />\nthree weeks ago by the Ad-Hoc Committee on Physical<br />\nEducation, \"The Department is currently operating on a<br />\nsub-marginal basis- to merely maintain current programs<br />\nand policy is impossible without an increased University<br />\ncommitment and additional financial support.\"<br />\nThe Committee urged the University to initiate a<br />\nminimal increase of 15% in the salaries of the<br />\nprofessional staff. They viewed the present situation as<br />\nsuch: \"Current salaries are low and approaching the<br />\nnon-competitive level.\" As a member of that special<br />\ncommittee, I was shown a salary schedule which can<br />\nonly be rated as \"appalling.\"<br />\nCoach Smith's decision was, in his own words,<br />\n\"The toughest decision I've had to make in my life.\" He<br />\nlooks back at his three years at Hopkins with mixed<br />\nemotions. He is particularly proud of the contribution<br />\nwhich the wrestling program is making on campus and is<br />\nespecially pleased about his role in developing certain<br />\nindividuals on the teams which he has coached. (He<br />\ncoached wrestling, freshman baseball, and was assistant<br />\ncoach of the football team). He points to this past year's<br />\nvarsity wrestling team captain, Richard Dryden, as a<br />\nprimary example. Only the coaches, out of the entire<br />\nfaculty at Homewood, have shown a concerted interest<br />\nin all phases of a student's life, whether it be the<br />\nintellectual or the social.<br />\nKyle Smith is leaving and there is no way that this<br />\ncould be changed. But it is hoped that the University<br />\nwill learn its lesson from this tragic occurrence. The<br />\npresent coaching staff is young and shows promise of<br />\nbeing the best in Hopkins history. This hope can only<br />\ncome to pass if the University will act now to keep these<br />\nmen here and attract more people like Coach Smith. I<br />\nwonder if Hopkins is up to this challenge?<br /><br />\nfinances. Hopkins ranks among the top ten in average<br />\nfaculty salary, yet we can just barely afford to pay our<br />\ncoaches what the average public school teacher in<br />\nBaltimore makes during his first year. The pay situation<br />\nis a disgrace to a university of the calibre of Hopkins.<br />\nBlame has to be directed towards all levels of the<br />\nadministration from the President down to Director of<br />\nAthletics, Marshal Turner. Dr. Gordon, here only two<br />\nyears, cannot be totally faulted. His predecessor, Milton<br />\nEisenhower was the moving force in increasing faculty<br />\nsalaries but he never worried about those men who have<br />\nthe closest relationship with the students among all the<br />\nmembers of the faculty. Dr. Eisenhower is a strong<br />\nsupporter of Hopkins athletics and still attends<br />\nswimming matches, wrestling matches and lacrosse<br />\ngames, but he failed to adequately provide for those<br />\nindividuals who guide the student athletes.<br />\nMorale Problem<br />\nThe second factor which enters into a Hopkins<br />\ncoach's decision to leave lies in the area of \"morale\".<br />\nThere is a definite barrier between the coaches, the<br />\ndirector of athletics and the administration. Coach<br />\nSmith felt that there was a \"true lack of support\" by the<br />\nUniversity. As was pointed out in a special report issued<br /><br />\nVarsity Track Team Loses Opening Meet to Swarthmore<br />\nBy JIM BERNSTEIN<br /><br />\nIn its opening meet of the<br />\n1969 season, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nTrack Team lost to Swarthmore<br />\nC.01 1ege, 89-56, a most<br />\naPpointing loss, since most of<br />\ntile team's members had managed<br />\nto survive the non rigors of Easter<br />\nvacation and return to the track<br />\nWars in reasonably good<br />\nCondition.<br />\nUnfortunately, travel<br />\nJr angements held up four or five<br />\n!Irst-liners so<br />\nthat they could not get<br />\nback in time for the meet. And, as 25 of<br />\n!he 33 point difference between the two<br />\nt,eahis came from five fewer first place<br />\nIttn.ishes for the Blue Jays, it seems that<br />\nIS was the key factor which ended the<br />\nPos.sibility for<br />\nwhat had shaped up as<br />\nquite a close meet.<br /><br />\nThe day's best performances for<br />\nA \u00b0Pkins were turned in on the field<br />\nvents as well as on the track. In fact,<br />\nwarthmore's margin of victory in the<br />\nneld (40-23) was only one point greater<br />\nplan was its track supremacy (49-33).<br />\ntlly gratifying was the six-point<br />\n'<br />\nullerformance turned in his first varsity<br />\nby shotputter and discus thrower<br />\n'id Schroedel, expecially his 41 foot<br /><br />\n/<br />\n2 inch shot put.<br />\n101<br />\nGerry McKinney took second<br />\nplace in the pole vault on the basis of<br />\nonly one more miss than the winner at<br />\nthe preliminary heights. Finally, Gem<br />\nMaurer took both the high jump (5 ft. 8<br />\ninches) and the long jump(20 ft. 1 in.).<br />\nDebits in the field consisted mainly in<br />\nthe lack of support by the squad's<br />\nback-up men in these events, as the Jays<br />\ntook only one third place here. Also,<br />\nthe Swarthmore sweep of the triple<br />\njump constituted a severe blow.<br />\nOn the track, the Jays' back-up<br />\nmen held their own against the Garnets,<br />\nbut their lead men were unable to hald<br />\noff their opponents. There were,<br />\nhowever, three quite bright spots here<br />\nfor the home team. Captain Al Goldberg<br />\ncopped first place honors in both the<br />\n100 and the 220, the latter in the<br />\nrespectable for early April time of :22.5<br />\nseconds.<br />\nSenior Jeff Lauren equaled his<br />\nbest dual meet time of last year in an<br />\neasy win in the mile with a 4:35.8 time.<br />\nAnd Junior Bill Preston recorded his<br />\nbest time ever in the 880(2:03.4) in the<br />\nmeet's most exciting race and missed<br />\nwinning it by the width of an expanded<br />\nchest.<br />\nIn all, the whole affair was best<br /><br />\nHopkins students, new and old, eat at<br /><br />\nsummarized by Coach Masken, when he<br />\nsaid that \"It was a shame to lose one we<br />\nshould have won\".
