A<br />\nlack of agreement between the<br />\nstudents, faculty members, and<br />\nadministrators on the subcommittee led Homewood Vice<br />\nPresident George Benton to state<br />\nlater that the program will not<br />\nbegin as soon as was originally<br />\nintended, the source said.<br />\nDenton's proposal, drafted<br />\nOctober 22, called for a merit<br />\nsystem \"intended to reward<br />\noutstanding academic<br />\naccomplishment.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe draft read in part: \"The<br />\nMerit Scholarship Program,<br />\nscheduled to begin with awards<br />\nin the 1975-76 academic year,<br />\nwill include fifty one-year merit<br />\nscholarships ranging from a<br />\n<br />\nvotes<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 restnettons<br />\non activates wages<br />\nBy RICHARD LORRAINE<br />\nThe Student Activities<br />\nCgrnmission (SAC) voted to<br />\ninipose restriction on \"salaries<br />\nand wages paid by student<br />\norganizations\" at its third<br />\nmeeting of the academic year<br />\nyesterday.<br />\nThe restriction was proposed<br />\nby Seth Fellheimer, senior class<br />\npresident, as an amendment to<br />\nthe guidelines presently under<br />\nconsideration by the SAC.<br />\nFellheimer, who proposed a<br />\nsimilar amendment at the<br />\nStudent Council meeting<br />\nWednesday night, stated that<br />\n\"organizations that wish to pay<br />\nwages should show that the<br />\nservice they are paying for<br />\nbenefits the community at<br />\nlarge\"<br />\nNumerous questions arose as<br />\nto what exactly constituted<br />\nwages and salaries.\" Several<br />\nmembers pointed out that in<br />\nmany activities, especially<br />\nathletics, it is necessary for<br />\nstudent members to travel, with<br />\nthe hotel ekpenses and meals<br />\nnormally paid by the individual<br />\norganization. Also as SC<br />\nPresident Andy Savitz noted,<br />\nvoluteers at the Spring Fair last<br />\nYear were given free lunches,<br />\nwhih could possibly by<br />\nconstrued as renumeration.<br />\nAfter lengthy debate, it was<br />\ndecided to leave this point to the<br />\ndiscretion of the SAC Executive<br />\nCommittee when they review the<br />\nexpenditures of the individual<br />\no<br />\nrganizations,<br />\ntxecutive<br />\nDiscussion on the proposed<br />\nbylaws was concluded at this<br />\nmeeting after an abortive attempt<br />\nto resume<br />\ndebate on article IV,<br />\nWhich concerned the<br />\nc\u00b0 mposition of the SAC<br />\nExecutive Committee. This<br />\narticle was the main topic of the<br />\ntwo previous SAC meetings,<br />\n<br />\nwhen it was decided to change<br />\nthe membership of the<br />\ncommittee from the present<br />\nthree members of the SC<br />\nTreasurer, who is chairman, the<br />\nSC President, and the Student<br />\nActivities Director, to a five-man<br />\ngroup, dropping the SC President<br />\nfrom permanent memberhsip,<br />\nbut allowing him to be elected as<br />\none of the three<br />\nmembers-at-large.<br />\nDiscussion was opened on a<br />\nproposal to prevent misuse of<br />\nfunds by student organizations<br />\nby freezing funds of groups<br />\nguilty of overspending. It was<br />\ndecided to give notice to the<br />\npresident and treasurer of the<br />\noffending organization one<br />\nmonth before the freezing of<br />\nfunds takes place, thus giving<br />\nthem time to rectify their<br />\noverexpenditures.<br />\n<br />\nminimum of $1000 to a<br />\nmaximum of full tuition.\"<br />\nHowever, certain members of<br />\nthe sub-committee found the<br />\nproposal unacceptable in its<br />\npresent form. \"In its present<br />\nstate, I would not support it,\"<br />\nstated Gordon Calhoun,<br />\nundergraduate representative to<br />\nCAAS. \"I consider it a very<br />\nquestionable procedure,\" stated a<br />\nfaculty member on the<br />\nsub-committee who requested his<br />\nname be withheld.<br />\nThough many of the specifics<br />\nof the merit scholarship program<br />\nsuch as financing have yet to be<br />\ndiscussed, the sub-committee did<br />\nnot schedule any future meeting<br />\nto further treat the proposal.<br />\n<br />\n\"Approval or disapproval of<br />\nthe merit scholarships will be<br />\ncontingent upon the final draft,\"<br />\nsaid Calhoun. \"It could be \u2022<br />\nsupported if certain criteria are<br />\nmet.\"<br />\n\"I think that such a program<br />\ncan be of substantial benefit to<br />\nHopkins if it is done right, and in<br />\nthis case I would support it,\" he<br />\ncontinued. \"As of now, though, I<br />\nwould not support the proposal.\"<br />\nJohn Colmers, Student<br />\nAssistant to the Dean, also<br />\nexpressed his opposition to the<br />\nproposal. \"I find it morally and<br />\npractically objectionable,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"I still feel that any money<br />\nwhich can be raised should be<br />\nput towards financial aid.\"<br />\n<br />\nAid eligibility expanded<br />\nBy SALLY SPENCER<br />\nRecently announced changes<br />\nin federal and collegiate<br />\nguidelines for financial aid policy<br />\nhave expanded the scope of<br />\nfinancial aid eligibility in an<br />\neffort to cushion the impact of<br />\ninflaction on the middle class<br />\n<br />\nfamily.<br />\n<br />\nC. Wayne Hood<br />\n<br />\nThe changes due to affect<br />\nHopkins undergraduates<br />\nbeginning next year are reflected<br />\nin standards set last month by<br />\nthe College Scholarship Service, a<br />\nnon-profit organization which<br />\nestablishes financial aid<br />\nguidelines used by a majority of<br />\nAmerican colleges. The service<br />\nhas reduced its estimate of how<br />\nmuch middle-income families<br />\nshould be expected to contribute<br />\ntoward college costs.<br />\nThe Federal government has<br />\nalso broadened its definition of<br />\neligibility for Basic Education<br />\nGrants and has taken steps to aid<br />\nthe middle-class student in<br />\nobtaining subsidized loans.<br />\nC. Wayne Hood, Director of<br />\nFinancial Aid, pointed out<br />\nthough that the funds required to<br />\nmeet this increased need may not<br />\nbe forthcoming.<br />\n\"There's going to be much<br />\nmore need on the campus with<br />\nthe same or less money available<br />\nto meet it. The new guidelines<br />\nare good only in that they are<br />\nmore realistic.

The program would<br />\noperate within the University and<br />\nwould not be publicized.<br />\nCalhoun, though, pointed out<br />\nthat such a system would not<br />\nprovide the benefits which<br />\nDenton's proposal would, such as<br />\npublicity for Hopkins and its<br />\nprograms.<br />\n<br />\nout. \"They owed us a date and<br />\nwe were lucky enough to get<br />\nthem to play' here,\" Rosenson<br />\nsaid.<br />\nThe Vice-President also<br />\ncommented that Gentle Giant, a<br />\nprogressive rock group may also<br />\nplay at the November 10 concert.<br />\nDirector of the Union, Alan<br />\nSapakie, stated the group \"has<br />\nnot been confirmed yet, but is<br />\nmost likely that they will appear<br />\nas the first act.<br />\n\"I've heard that Geritle Giant<br />\nis an up and coming English roch<br />\ngroup,\" commented Sapakie.<br />\nRosenson said that tickets for<br />\nthe concert will go ()male at teh<br />\nbeginning of next week. \"As<br />\nusual Hopkins students will get<br />\nfirst shots at tickets and get a<br />\nreduced rate of $5,\" he said.<br />\nOn December 8, the New<br />\nRiders of the Purple Sage will<br />\n<br />\nperform in what Rosenson<br />\nexpects to be \"a very dynamic<br />\nstage presentation.\" He added<br />\nthat \"they are a great group\u2014and<br />\ngood friends of the Grateful<br />\nDead.\"<br />\nRosenson said a new security<br />\npolicy will be in effect to ensure<br />\npeople do not bring liquor into<br />\nthe concert. \"At the last concert,<br />\nthere was a misunderstanding<br />\nover who would clean up all the<br />\nbeer cans and debris. This time<br />\nthere will be more people<br />\nworking at teh door to make sure<br />\nno one brings liquor in,\" he said.<br />\nHe was optimistic about<br />\nattendence for both concerts.<br />\n\"At the last concert, Mahavishnu.<br />\nwe had about 600 Hopkim<br />\nstudents and 1400 people from<br />\nthe community. This time I hope<br />\nwe get. more, we can get even<br />\nmore people from Hopkins.\"<br />\n<br />\nacknowledge that needs exist<br />\neven if we don't have the funds<br />\nto adequately cover them,\"<br />\ncommented Hood.<br />\nNext year's financial aid<br />\nbudget will be calculated on the<br />\nbasis of total cost projections.<br />\nHood estimated that it will cost<br />\nthe average resident student<br />\n$6,060 and the average<br />\nnon-resident student $5,300 to<br />\nattend Hopkins next year. These<br />\nfigures include tuition, room,<br />\nboard, travel, and other expenses<br />\nsuch as clothing, books, and<br />\nminimal recreation.<br />\n\"People who require the entire<br />\nbudget will have to take on a<br />\ntremendous financial burden. We<br />\njust don't have the funds to take<br />\ncare of them. In view of the<br />\nfinancial situations, some<br />\nstudents will probably decide not<br />\nto attend Hopkins,\" added Hood.<br />\nThe financial aid office has<br />\nasked for a total of $6 million in<br />\nFederal funds with $350,000<br />\nearmarked for- the Arts and<br />\nSciences division. Hood asserted<br />\nthat it is unlikely that Hopkins<br />\nwill receive all of these funds.<br />\n\"We're feeling the squeeze at<br />\nall ends,\" said Hood. \"Tuition is<br />\nincreasing and many students not<br />\neligible for aid before will now be<br />\nconsidered. In addition, we must<br />\ntake care of those students<br />\nalready receiving aid.\"<br />\nHood stated he does not yet<br />\nknow how Hopkins will cope<br />\nwith pressures to increase<br />\nfinancial aid.<br />\n\"We have a range of choices.<br />\nThey go from concentrating on<br />\nadmitting students with no need,<br />\nto meeting a small percentage of<br />\neach individual's need. Neither<br />\nalternative is acceptable as each<br />\nworks against the basic goals<br />\nfinancial aid is attempting to<br />\nrealize.\"<br />\nHood admitted that covering<br />\nincreasing need with fixed funds<br />\nwill not be easy. \"There is no<br />\nimmediate equitable solution,\"<br />\nhe noted. \"Through needs<br />\nanalysis, we hope to find an<br />\nanswer which will minimize<br />\nstudent frustration.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2:news-1etter/november I, 1974<br />\n\u2022\u2014<br />\n<br />\ncampus notes<br />\nDISPLAY THYSELF<br />\nAny student, faculty member,<br />\nadministrator, or staff member of<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University who<br />\nwould like to display art or craft in<br />\nthe Hopkins Union or use the<br />\ndisplay cases in the lobby of the<br />\nUnion please contact Alan Sapakie<br />\nMitch Clarvit, or Tim Oldfield in the<br />\nnew Union.<br />\nCHURCHILL SCHOLARSHIPS<br />\nNovember 15 is the application<br />\ndeadline for the Winston Churchill<br />\nFoundation Scholarships for<br />\ngraduate study in Engineering,<br />\nMathematics, and Science at<br />\nChurchill College, Cambridge<br />\nUniversity, England.

Only<br />\nif Saga cannot cater an event will<br />\na user be able to contact other<br />\n<br />\nfood services, she asserted.<br />\nThe order of priorities, as<br />\nlisted by the policy proposal, is<br />\nas follows: an open event by a<br />\nuniversity group, first; any<br />\nuniveristy group with a closed<br />\nmembership, second; individual<br />\nmembers of the community,<br />\nthird; and non-Hopkins groups<br />\nlast.<br />\nAs noted in the proposal, a top<br />\npriority group may \"preempt\" a<br />\nlower priority group if a conflict<br />\narises.<br />\nNo University group whether<br />\nits membership is open or closed<br />\nwill be subjected to any financial<br />\nobligations for room use.<br />\nHowever, non-Hopkins groups<br />\nwill be subject to a fee set by the<br />\n<br />\nUnion Governi..g Board.<br />\nThe student council made an<br />\naddition to the room use policy<br />\nthat \u2022 the Ratliskellar may not be<br />\nreserved.

The Union was designed for<br />\nthe whole community, with the<br />\nmajority of its usage by the<br />\nstudents,\" he said.<br />\n<br />\nBy ELLEN BERNHARD<br />\n<br />\nAlan Fink<br />\n<br />\nDr. Calderone speaks on sex education<br />\nBy RICH D'AGOSTINO<br />\nThe 1974 Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium on<br />\n\"Human Sexuality\" continued<br />\nyesterday when Dr. Mary<br />\nCalderone, executive director and<br />\nco-founder of the Sex<br />\nInformation and Education<br />\nCouncil of the United States<br />\n(SEICUS), spoke on \"Education<br />\nfor Human Sexuality: Cause or<br />\nEffect of Change\".<br />\nCalderone began her speech,<br />\nby stating that it is absurd for<br />\none adult to get up in front of a<br />\ngroup and talk to them about<br />\nhuman sexuality. She emphasized<br />\nthat sexuality is a normal, natural<br />\npart of life, and it was not really<br />\nthe right of one individual to<br />\nstate what is right or wrong, or<br />\nwhat sexuality really means or<br />\nrepresents.<br />\nShe went on to equate human<br />\nsexuality with the basic, natural<br />\nacts of life, like eating and<br />\nsleeping. She stated that hunger<br />\nis a survival function, and<br />\n<br />\nappetite is strictly a social<br />\nfunction, sex is both of these<br />\nfunctions. Also, there can be an<br />\nobsession with food in both<br />\nquantity and quality, also present<br />\nin sex. Calderone then said that<br />\nsex, like sleeping, is a natural act<br />\nand should not be disturbed,<br />\ndistorted. or twisted.<br />\nThe main context of her<br />\nspeech was her \"breakdown of<br />\nhuman sexuality.\" She divided<br />\nsexuality into three parts: gender<br />\nidentity, gender. behavior, and<br />\ngender sex response.<br />\nCalderone stated that a child's<br />\ngender identity is formed or<br />\ncreated by the time the child is<br />\ntwo years of age. The parents or<br />\nthe closest guardians of the child<br />\nhave the most effect on the child.<br />\nBy the way the child is treated<br />\nand the way the parents bring<br />\nhim up, will affect the way the<br />\nchild thinks of him or herself.<br />\nShe emphasized that a child must<br />\nbe sure of his gender identity in<br />\nthe early years, or some<br />\n<br />\nHousing lottery system proposed<br />\nMembers of the Student<br />\nCouncil Housing Committee<br />\nProposed a lottery system for<br />\ndetermining allocations of<br />\nUniversity-owned apartments at<br />\nWednesday night's SC meeting.<br />\nThe proposal, submitted by<br />\nSue Blum and \u2022 John Perrotta,<br />\nwould replace the sign-up system<br />\nnow in use.<br />\nThey also revealed that<br />\nhousing priorities would be<br />\nextended to students with<br />\nphysical handicaps or emotional<br />\nProblem as well as to women,<br />\nblacks, and special students who<br />\nwere unable to find housing<br />\nbecause of discrimination.<br />\nTwo to six spaces in Wolman<br />\nHall and Rogers House would be<br />\nreserved for such emergencies.<br />\nConstitution revisions to<br />\ncreate a social committee and to<br />\nprovide salaries in extracurricular<br />\nactivities were proposed by Seth<br />\nFeltheimer, president of the<br />\nsenior class. The social<br />\ncommittee proposal was passed<br />\nunanimously.<br />\nIt will be chaired<br />\nby the Vice President of the<br />\nstudent council and will consist<br />\nof all the class presidents as<br />\nwell<br />\nas members<br />\nof the student body<br />\n<br />\nLeah Seidenfeld<br />\n<br />\nwho apply and are selected. The<br />\ncommittee's purpose is to<br />\nintroduce new ideas onto campus<br />\nand act as a check on decisions<br />\nmade on social activities.<br />\nHonor<br />\nAddressing the Council, John<br />\nMcClure discussed the term paper<br />\nservices that were advertised in<br />\nthe News-letter as \"obviously<br />\nunfair to hard-working students<br />\nand others on campus.\" \"It's<br />\npretty hypocritical on the part of<br />\nthe News-Letter which has<br />\nchampioned the Honor<br />\nCommission for the last few<br />\nyears,\" he said. Ann Connors,<br />\nhead of the Honor Commission,<br />\nwas present for the meeting.<br />\nSavitz then read letters<br />\nreceived from the Attorney<br />\nGeneral of Maryland which<br />\nstated that if there were \"any<br />\nfurther attempts of sale or<br />\noffering of sale of term papers,<br />\ncriminal indictments would be<br />\nsought.\" Anyone found guilty<br />\nwould be subject to a fine of<br />\n$1,000 and/or six ,months in<br />\nprison under state law.<br />\nCPlection<br />\nThe Student Council ha<br />\nfinished selections of 65<br />\nundergraduates to be members of<br />\n<br />\nthe 14 committees under the<br />\ncouncil. A list will be made<br />\npublic and each committee<br />\nmember has been asked to post<br />\noffice hours when the students<br />\ncan get in touch with them.<br />\n<br />\npsychological problems may<br />\ndevelop in later years.<br />\nA person's sexual behavior is<br />\ninfluenced all through his life, by<br />\neither his parents or the outside<br />\nsocial environment. In the earlier<br />\nyears, again the parents have the<br />\nmost effect on this behavior<br />\ndevelopment. From the way the<br />\nparents feel about how masculine<br />\nor feminine a person should be,<br />\nwill be the extent of the person's<br />\nsexual behavior.<br />\nCalderone discussed the<br />\ndefinition of a truly masculine or<br />\ntruly feminine person. She cited<br />\nstudies done by Johnson and<br />\nConnors, who have been studying<br />\nthe sexual behavior of males and<br />\nfemales for over forty years.<br />\nThey found, that there are<br />\nfourteen aptitudes in which the<br />\nmale and female are exactly the<br />\nsame, and therefore a problem in<br />\ndefining masculinity or feminity<br />\narises.<br />\nShe stated that approximately<br />\n7% of our population are true<br />\nhomosexuals, meaning that they<br />\nwere brought up in an<br />\natmosphere of homosexuality<br />\nand it is their true nature. There<br />\nare those which are called<br />\n\"elective homosexuals\" who,<br />\nbecause of their environment and<br />\nlack of heterosexual love, turned<br />\nto homosexual sex play to satisfy<br />\ntheir needs. These people are not<br />\ntrue homosexuals, but are those<br />\n<br />\nwhich have been forced into this<br />\nstate by need.<br />\nSexual<br />\nShe also added that the<br />\nAmerican Psychological Society<br />\nhas decided that homosexuality<br />\nis not an illness. The sudden<br />\n\"surge\" toward homosexuality,<br />\nCalderone stated, is a direct<br />\nresult of the new openness of<br />\nsociety.<br />\nA person's sexual response is<br />\nalso affected by the parents. A<br />\nparent's attitude toward the acts<br />\nof masturbation and sex play,<br />\ncan directly influence a child's<br />\nresponsiveness, either negatively<br />\nor positively. It has been seen,<br />\nthat a parent's strict attitudes<br />\ntoward sex, can cause such<br />\nproblems as frigidity in later life.<br />\nCalderone culminated her<br />\nspeech with the new<br />\ndevelopments in human<br />\nsexuality. She stated that<br />\nHopkins and other universities<br />\naround the country have adopted<br />\nhuman sexuality as a new field in<br />\ntheir Health Science<br />\nDepartments. She also<br />\nemphasized that the basic goal of<br />\nSIECUS is to make the<br />\npopulation sexually informed,<br />\nand mature. She said that the<br />\nnew knowledge toward sex must<br />\nbe assimilated into the present<br />\nsociety in order to make the<br />\npopulation more aware of the<br />\npresent state of human sexuality.<br />\n<br />\nBG & E accept $2000-3000 bill<br />\nBy ELLEN BERNHARD<br />\nA $2000-3000 bill has been<br />\nserved on the Baltimore Gas and<br />\nElectric Company following the<br />\nrepair on power plant facilities<br />\ntwo weeks ago.<br />\nA four-minute accidental<br />\nblack-out Wednesday October 16<br />\noccurred as a result of faulty<br />\ncapacitators in a Gas and Electric<br />\nCompany station located outside<br />\nthe campus.

My path<br />\nUpon receiving notice of my<br />\nwas assured.<br />\nacceptance to The Johns Hopkins<br />\nHowever on the first day at<br />\nUniversity during my senior year in<br />\nHopkins, I was a bit annoyed to.<br />\nhigh school, I was, as Mr. Dilger<br />\ndiscover that the struggle for status<br />\nvery elegantly expresses in his<br />\nhad not ceased. Status could not<br />\nletter printed in the N-L of<br />\nbe achieved by intellectual<br />\nOctober 29, quite surprised. Then<br />\nendeavor alone but by factors as<br />\nagain not so terribly. I had very<br />\nobscure as shoe size, as prominent<br />\nfew notions about attending<br />\nas personal family wealth. \"Hi, I'm<br />\nHopkins. I had applied only out of<br />\nHoward Deservestobehere from<br />\nrespect for my mother's ancestral<br />\nSociety Hill in Philadelphia<br />\nconnections in Baltimore. I had<br />\nPennsylvania. I graduated number<br />\nsaid no to what I had been told<br />\none in a class of two million from<br />\nwere finer schools, such as \u2022Ritzprivate Academy with a 790<br />\nDartmouth and Cornell, and had<br />\non my verbal and 760 on my math.<br />\nmy mind firmly set upon the<br />\nI had a headache that day so I<br />\necstatic anarchy of the Yellow<br />\ncouldn't do better than that.\" So, I<br />\nSprings campus of Antioch<br />\nwatched the members of my class<br />\nCollege. But the anarchy proved a<br />\ncarefully isolate themselves on the<br />\ntrifle more that I had expected and<br />\nbasis of everything from the length<br />\nI calmly resigned myself to the<br />\nof their shoestrings to the number<br />\nprospect of spending the next four<br />\nof zebras they had in their<br />\nyears of my life in the tranquil city<br />\nindividual private garages.<br />\nof Baltimore. The fact was that I<br />\nThe fraternities didn't help the<br />\nreally knew less about this school<br />\nsituation in the least, in fact the<br />\nthan I knew about the moon,<br />\nmerely enhanced it. \"Hey guess<br />\nwhich besides the fact that it<br />\nwhat gang, I just joined Delta Fool<br />\nexisted, was virtually nothing.

Here the<br />\nname Hopkins made the eyes of<br />\nmovement of Hopkins elitism<br />\nmany a sage of the older, wiser,<br />\nculminates in the creation of a very<br />\nwhiter generations light up with<br />\nrigid order of pseudo-intellectual<br />\namazement: \"Now there's a<br />\npoliticos entirely isolated from the<br />\ncolored boy with hot diggity brains<br />\nrest of the Hopkins community by<br />\nif he's going to Hopkins.\" This<br />\ntheir exaggerated notions of<br />\nopinion was echoed by many and<br />\nself-importance. It is here that all<br />\nslowly there began to manifest<br />\nthe controversy rages about the<br />\nthemselves inside of me, feelings of imperatives of Student Council<br />\ntremendous self satisfaction of<br />\npresidents, organizational priorities<br />\nbeing esconced safely within the<br />\nin scheduling, and tensions<br />\nranks of the nation's top scholars.

That is why the<br />\nUniversity is not the exclusive province of its students; and<br />\nthat is why it is not those who would seek access to<br />\nits<br />\nfacilities, but those who would deny it, that are deserving of<br />\nreprimand.<br />\nThe argument advanced in favor of the restrictive use<br />\npolicy is invariably a Financial one. Steve<br />\nLovejoy,<br />\nundergraduate representative to the Library Advisory<br />\nCouncil, terms use of the Library by outsiders \"a financial<br />\ndrain\" on the Library's services. \"If we are concerned about<br />\ntuition increases,\" Lovejoy writes, \"we should be willing to<br />\nsupport such policies.\" However, use of the Library by<br />\nanyone, students included, constitutes an eventual drain on<br />\nits services. But if. students are not to be punished<br />\nfor<br />\nimposing in such a fashion, why should others? Along the<br />\nsame line, University officials have argued in the past that<br />\nunlimited access to Hopkins facilities might result in costly<br />\nvandalism. It is worth noting here, though, that the most<br />\ncostly vandalism in recent memory occurred in the<br />\n__ _<br />\nRathskellar,<br />\nafter the institution of restricted admissions<br />\nIn their attempts Lo preserve peace, elitism, and, so they<br />\nthink, financial security, University officials have imposed on<br />\nalmost all Hopkins facilities a closed use policy. In their<br />\nconcern, in these tight economic times, to conserve revenues<br />\nand eliminate \"financial drains,\" they have been put to a test<br />\nand, sadly, been found wanting in judgment.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editui.<br />\nthrow out the baby with the bath<br />\nI have read your imaginative water nor to pickle her in it; we are<br />\narticle on the future of The Writing using the occasion of Newman's<br />\nSeminars, and I think I can allay at appointment to review all the<br />\nleast some of your offerings and activities of The<br />\nmisapprehensions.<br />\nWriting Seminars, to the end of<br />\n'Them has been no decision pteseINVA what's PleseIN'able of<br />\nwa.\\k-t.e.' c othe.rwisew\u2018k.Nc\u2018 V.\\\\Nok C_.olernan's xv\u2018s?,,xxlar kVaN0x<br />\n<br />\nfrequently in Hopkins sponsored<br />\nactivities for over one year, we feel<br />\ncompelled to write this letter on<br />\nbehalf of a number of Notre Dame<br />\nstudents.

There<br />\ndoes seem to be a need, however,<br />\nfor an undergraduate course in<br />\nresponsible journalism.<br />\nI look forward to working with<br />\nyou.<br />\nCharles Newman<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe faculty of the Writing<br />\nSeminars take the Tragic View of<br />\nJournalism: newspapers are<br />\nindispensible despite the fact that<br />\nthey never get anything quite right.<br />\nNevertheless, we were all surprised<br />\nby the front page headline in the<br />\nNews-Letter of Tuesday, October<br />\n2 9 : UNDERGRADUATE<br />\nWRITING SEMINARS MAJOR<br />\nMAY END. Together with the<br />\naccompanying article and editorial,<br />\nit strongly implies that our<br />\nundergraduate major is a lame<br />\nduck, even a dead pidgeon, when<br />\nin fact it is merely cruising for the<br />\npresent on one wing.<br />\nIn June, Elliot Coleman will<br />\nretire as Director of our<br />\ndepartment, over which he has<br />\nlovingly presided since its<br />\ninception at Johns Hopkins in<br />\n1948. The Seminars are his longest<br />\npoem, and a fine one. People like<br />\nColeman are not replaced; they're<br />\nonly succeeded. and what should<br />\nnow probably succeed is not more<br />\nstanzas of the same good poem but<br />\nanother story.<br />\nCharles Newman's appeal as<br />\nincoming Director of the Seminars<br />\nis that in addition to his gifts as<br />\nwriter, editor. critic, and teacher,<br />\nhe has lively ideas about both our<br />\nundergrad and our graduate<br />\nprograms. The trick is neither to<br />\n<br />\nprograms to accomodate the<br />\nenergies and inclinations of our<br />\n<br />\nfaculty (some of whom are yet to<br />\nbe recruited), and of oui students,<br />\nwhose complexion doesn't hold<br />\nstill either.<br />\nAll we know for sure just now is<br />\nthat we intend our little<br />\ndepartment to be a formidable,<br />\nattractive one, with first-class<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate<br />\ninstruction. There is something to<br />\nbe said for discontinuing the<br />\nundergraduate major if, for<br />\nexample. undergraduates could<br />\ntake as many courses with us as<br />\nthey do now, or more, as part of<br />\nthe major in English or<br />\nHumanities. There is also much to<br />\nbe said for retaining the major if<br />\nwe can expand our offerings. What<br />\nmatters is that the writers in the<br />\nroom who happen to be<br />\nundergraduates get to work closely<br />\n(and for credit) with the poets and<br />\nfictionists on our faculty. The rest<br />\nis, well, academic.<br />\nSo we are talking about that,<br />\nand lots of other things, and no<br />\nfinal decisions are likely to be<br />\nmade tomorrow. Things are in<br />\nferment, as they say, with<br />\nappropriate confusion,<br />\ncontradiction, and misreportage.<br />\nbut if it didn't smell more like<br />\nchampagne than vinegar, we<br />\nwouldn't be here.<br />\nJohn Barth<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThere were inaccuracies and<br />\nmistakes in the last News-Letter,<br />\nsuch as a statement that I will be<br />\nleaving the University at the close<br />\nof this academic year. Actually, I<br />\nam very happy here and am not<br />\ncomtemplating any moves.<br />\nHowever, much worse than this<br />\nwere the insults in the article<br />\nconcerning Dr. Benton.<br />\nManipulator...Cruel...Sychopant (I<br />\nchecked this one with<br />\nWebster's)...or \"Wretched excesses<br />\nand all pervading dishonesty.\" Is<br />\none of the purposes of a newspaper<br />\nto insult people?<br />\nRoberto R. Arellano<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWe would like to commend Russ<br />\nSmith for his article on Hopkins'<br />\n\"elitism\" (Oct. 11). It is about<br />\ntime someone tried to open the<br />\neyes of the students who make<br />\nlittle effort to remedy the<br />\nsuperiority which seems to come<br />\nalong with their enrollment.<br />\nAfter having participated<br />\n<br />\nvt-vax\u2022').<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022,.<br />\n<br />\nwho do not fit into this stereotype.<br />\n<br />\nOn the other hand, we realize that<br />\nthere are some Hopkins students<br />\nwllo do not fit into the stereotype<br />\n<br />\nof the aspiring rich doctor.<br />\nWhen we are asked where we go<br />\nto school, we feel much more<br />\nhesitant about answering when<br />\ntalking to a Hopkins student than<br />\nto anyone else. It seems to be a<br />\ngeneral assumption that a Notre<br />\nDame student is inferior. Whether<br />\nwe are or not is not the main<br />\npoint. What we are should not rest<br />\non the name of our school and<br />\nwhat you are should not rest on<br />\nthe name of yours.<br />\nSeeing the Hopkins community<br />\nfrom the outside and talking to<br />\nother \"outsiders,\" we have heard<br />\nthe laughter at this pompous<br />\nattitude. Still, to us, Hopkins does<br />\noffer a good variety of things to<br />\ndo. But the success of your<br />\nactivities depends upon the<br />\namount of participation, and<br />\npeople who feel put down will<br />\nlook elsewhere to spend their time<br />\nand money.<br />\nAnne Battalle<br />\nLucy Collinson<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe Oct. 29 issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter has a misprint in the<br />\narticle by Paula Tarnapol. What I<br />\nsaid was that I don't want people<br />\nto get the impression that I have<br />\nbeen snowed by Harvard, not<br />\nHopkins, as_ was printed. I have<br />\n<br />\nalways felt snowed by Hopkins!<br />\nGregory Nagy<br />\nProfessor of Classics<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n1 write in response to Robert J.<br />\nDilger's letter of Oct. 29. I do not<br />\n<br />\n(17\u2018vasiree \u202244:AX-. kih, asuc. pcimat tliat<br />\nHopkiiii will either rise or<br />\nfall by reaction of academically<br />\n<br />\nexcellent studeAts to JHU housing.<br />\n<br />\nIn my opinion, such a<br />\ncontention is ridiculous. Firstly,<br />\nMr. Dilger, why did in those glory<br />\n_ _<br />\ndays oi. yore didn't \u2022 scholastic<br />\nwizards regurgitate at the sight of<br />\nBawlmer roWhouses, apts. et<br />\nal...and run off to Cambridge or<br />\nNew Haven? Surely the housing<br />\nsituation was not much better<br />\nthen. Now that competition for<br />\nthe best of the Ivy League is so<br />\nheated, housing would have even a<br />\nlesser effect.<br />\nBut what really disturbs me<br />\nabout the letter is Dilger's belief<br />\nthat Hopkins'. \"acceptability\" and<br />\nour standing in Barron's determine<br />\nwhether we are \"a good school like<br />\nhundreds of others or something<br />\nspecial as in the past.\" This<br />\nstatement is full of it. I hope that<br />\nHopkins' reputation is not based<br />\non such statistics as average SAT<br />\nscores, median Persian achievement<br />\nscores, or how many seniors per<br />\nyear the Admissions office can<br />\nsend crying away from Garland.<br />\nHopkins reputation is grounded in<br />\nan excellent faculty, fine research<br />\nlibrary, size of the student body,<br />\nand stress on individual<br />\nachievement.<br />\nIf these features don't attract<br />\ntop-flight students, then maybe<br />\n\u2022Hopkins would be better off<br />\nwithout them.<br />\nJan Hammerman<br />\n<br />\nNews-letter and Course Guide<br />\nrupture into open disputes<br />\ncompletely beyond the notice and,<br />\nI suspect, the interest of the rest of<br />\nthe entire.<br />\n\u2022 studentbody.<br />\nRecently', I have had the<br />\nsomewhat'questionable pleasure of<br />\njoining this coterie of characters by<br />\nmy appointment to the illustrious<br />\nUnion Governing Board. I was<br />\namong the various individuals<br />\nconsidered important enough to<br />\nattend the invitation-only opening<br />\nof the Hopkins Student Union. It<br />\nwas of course, an experience, never<br />\nto be forgotten. It was not until I<br />\nnoticed that many of the 'person,s<br />\npresent were in attendance in<br />\nmany official capacities that I<br />\nnoticed that perhaps the so-called<br />\nHopkins \"power base\" was a trifle<br />\nsmall. I was essentially three<br />\npeople. Associate editor of the<br />\nCourse Guide (by some estimates,<br />\na meager claim to fame), soliciting<br />\neditor of the Social Science<br />\nBulletin, and a member of the<br />\nU.G.B. There were probably a<br />\ndozen or more persons on the<br />\nmerit of six or seven different<br />\ncapacities, getting along intimately<br />\nwith good old George, our old<br />\nbuddy Larry, I didn't see Siggy<br />\nthere, but Glenn sure was and<br />\nlooking mighty fine. Then of<br />\ncourse there was Andy, Shep, who<br />\nwe all haven't seen in so long,<br />\nKaren, Judi, et al., all very caught<br />\nin our own delusions of grandeur.<br />\nWhile we stood there engaging in<br />\ntrite schwartze and shigetze<br />\nhumor,a lone fellow stood outside<br />\nthe great Glass Pavilion, the bane<br />\nof our admiration, holding up a<br />\nsign to protest the tuition hike<br />\napproved by the trustees the<br />\nmorning of the same day. We all<br />\ntried to pretend he was not there.<br />\nFinally, someone dressed in a pin<br />\nAnd here you are<br />\nstripe suit and looking the epitome Billy Q. Undergraduate<br />\nwas applies here, too. Maybe the<br />\nof the University fat cat went out unimportant. We would<br />\nworry elitism and struggle for status hides<br />\nand debated with him.

The series<br />\nhas been marked by upset<br />\nvictors. Last season, the Tigers<br />\nwere rolling along to their best<br />\nseason ever. They came into<br />\nHomewood Field with a 4-1<br />\nrecord and were heavy favorites.<br />\nHowever, led by quarterback<br />\nJack Thomas, the underdog Blue<br />\nJays jumped off to a 16-0 lead<br />\nand held on to upset Towson<br />\nState 33-20. From that game on<br />\nthe Tigers' season went straight<br />\ndownhill.<br />\nThe Blue Jays surprise win in<br />\n1973 was only revenge for the<br />\nTigers upset victory in 1972. In<br />\nthat game, the heavily favored<br />\nHopkins eleven travelled to<br />\nTowson to play what has since<br />\nbeen dubbed the \"mud bowl.\" A<br />\nheavy rain the morning of the<br />\n<br />\ngame made playing conditions<br />\ndeplorable and the Tigers went<br />\non to capture the surprise<br />\nvictory. It turned out to be<br />\nTowson State's only win of the<br />\nyear!<br />\nSo, needless to say, anything<br />\ncan happen when these two<br />\narch-rivals tangle.<br />\nThis year's game continues the<br />\ntopsy-turvy precedent set in<br />\nprevious years. This season it is<br />\nthe Blue Jays turn to play the<br />\nrole of underdog.<br />\nHopkins football has been a<br />\ndownward skid since the Jays<br />\nopening win over Muhlenberg.<br />\nCoach Dennis Cox's charges are<br />\nin the midst of a four game<br />\nnon-winning streak and their<br />\noverall slate stands at 1-3-1.<br />\nOn the other side of the<br />\npigskin, Towon State is the only<br />\nunbeaten college eleven in<br />\nMaryland, boasting a 7-0 record.<br />\nMost of their wins have come in<br />\nimpressive style and there are<br />\nnumerous reasons for this. Some<br />\nof them include the best passer in<br />\nthe state of Maryland, the best<br />\nreceiver in the state, the state's<br />\n<br />\nseventh leading rusher, and the<br />\nthird best rushing defense<br />\n(Division III) in the entire nation.<br />\nTiger quarterback Dan Dulles<br />\nis the leader of the potent<br />\nTowson State offense. In State's<br />\nseven contests thus far, Dulles<br />\nranks as the number one passer in<br />\nthe state. He has completd an<br />\nastounding 107 passes in 166<br />\nattempts for an incredible 65%<br />\ncompletion percentage. His aerial<br />\nconnections have covered 1,436<br />\nyards, hooked-up for 14<br />\ntouchdowns, while suffering only<br />\n6 interceptions.<br />\nDefense<br />\nOther Tigers that the Blue Jay<br />\ndefense will attempt to cage<br />\ninclude ace receiver Barrett-34<br />\nreceptions for 521 yards and 5<br />\ntouchdowns, first in the<br />\nstate\u2014and running back Larry.<br />\nJones. Jones is the backbone of<br />\nthe State's grouhd game,<br />\naccumulating 464 yards in 111<br />\ncarries for a 4.1 average and 6<br />\nTD's, good enough to rank<br />\nseventh in Maryland.<br />\nIt will be rough assignment for<br />\nthe young, banged-up and<br />\n<br />\ngym shorts<br />\n\u2014Bull Roast<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Alumni<br />\n\"H\" Club will be sponsoring their<br />\n2nd Annual Bull Roast on<br />\nSaturday, November 16 from<br />\n4:00 until 8:00 following the<br />\nHopkins-Dickinson football<br />\ngame.

The sentiment expressed<br />\nis by no means exclusive to Mr. Young,<br />\nhowever. \"Hey it's good to be back home<br />\nagain; sometimes this old farm feels like a<br />\nlong lost friend,\"croons that paragon of<br />\nAM virtue, John Denver. Yet another<br />\nexample: \"And it's good old country<br />\ncomfort in my bones, just the sweetest<br />\nsound my ears have ever known,\" sings<br />\nElton John in a song from his<br />\npre-degeneracy days. One moment please,<br />\nhowever. A music critique this is not. The<br />\npoint to be derived thus far is that there<br />\ndoes exist a widespread sentimental desire<br />\nto \"get back to the country,\" as<br />\nexpressed in the lines above, and as well<br />\nin the sounds of countless other<br />\ntroubadors. Thus, an implied opposition:<br />\ngetting out of the city.The city, it<br />\nseems is just not at all compatible with<br />\nthe \"back to nature\" desire that afflicts<br />\nthe modern consciousness. (My God, if<br />\nthey come out with yet another \"natural<br />\ncereal,\" I'll go nuts!)<br />\nThe \"return to the country\" theme is<br />\nalmost overbearingly prevalent in our<br />\nmodern times: Do not, however, let our<br />\nextreme awareness of that notion lead<br />\nyou to believe that it is exclusive to<br />\nrecent times. To cite one among<br />\ninnumerable examples, I take you back to<br />\nthe late 15th century (before you were<br />\nborn, kiddies), recounting a fable related<br />\n<br />\nby Leonardo DaVinci: The Stone: \"A<br />\nstone of fine size, recently uncovered by<br />\nthe waters, was standing on a certain high<br />\nplace, where a pleasant little wood ended<br />\nat a rocky road, and it was surrounded by<br />\nherbs and various flowers of all kinds of<br />\ncolors; and as it looked at the great<br />\nnumber of stones all together in the road<br />\nbelow it, the desire came to it to drop<br />\ndown there, and it said to itself: 'What<br />\nam I doing here with these little plants? I<br />\nwant to live with my sisters there.' And<br />\ndown it dropped, and rolled to a stop<br />\namong the comrades it longed for; and<br />\nsoon it began to be in constant travail,<br />\nfrom the wheels of carts, the hooves of<br />\niron-shod horses, and the travellers' feet:<br />\nthiS one turned it, the other kicked it,<br />\nsometimes a chip was take off, or again, it<br />\nwas covered with mud of the dung of<br />\nsome animal; and it looked back in vain<br />\nto the place it had departed from, to that<br />\nplace of solitary and tranquil peace. And<br />\nthis is what happens to those who desire<br />\nto go from a solitary contemplative life to<br />\nlive in the cities among people full of<br />\ninfinite evils.\"<br />\nWell, fellow HopPies\u2014people of<br />\n\"infinite evils\" that you may or may not<br />\nbe\u2014all of the above has been, by way of<br />\ngross circumlocution, an attempt to<br />\n\"draw you in,\" to maneuver you to<br />\nrealize that, like it or not, you are now<br />\ncity dwellers. For some, this status<br />\nrepresents no change; for others, the<br />\n\"back home desire\" is no doubt the<br />\nstrongest within them. But let us all face<br />\nthe reality: here we are, condemned or<br />\n-\u2022\u2022oimr\u2022,;Ntilirak,<br />\n<br />\nWOODY<br />\nALLEN<br />\nA<br />\nTAKES A<br />\nNOSTALGIC LOOK<br />\nAT THE<br />\nFUTURE.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022416\u2018<br />\n<br />\nattempt to cover in articles-to-come in<br />\nthe News-letter. To start out, however,<br />\nwe propose a mild initiation, one that<br />\ninvolves the act of just visually \"taking<br />\nin\" the city around you. It's really very<br />\nsimple. First, select a bright clear day<br />\n(admittedly all too infrequent in this east<br />\ncoast climate, fickle as a beautiful co-ed:<br />\nallh, where are you, ma chere?). Next,<br />\nand this may prove the only real<br />\ndifficulty, you will need transportation,<br />\ni.e., a car. If you do not own one, do not<br />\nfeel obligated to run out and buy one (or<br />\nsteal one, or whatever). Rather, find a<br />\ncar-owning friend, and give him a dollar<br />\nor two for gas. Then, ask him to drive<br />\nyou from one end of Charles Street to the<br />\nother. O.K., so it doesn't sound like an<br />\naction-packed adventure that would<br />\nshort-circuit your pacemaker. Despite<br />\nthat, have faith. Try it, and you will, in<br />\nthe course of your drive, encounter a city<br />\nof stark, sometimes amazing, sometimes<br />\ndisturbing,contrasts. Proceed :rom south<br />\nto north in your drive (unless yob get<br />\nyour jollies from going the wrong way<br />\ndown a one-way street). In doing so, you<br />\nwill be, economically speaking, moving<br />\n\"upwards.\" Do not strictly adhere to the<br />\nstraight and narrow path; turn onto a side<br />\nstreet every so ooften, for there you will<br />\nwitness those sights that, in retrospect,<br />\nreveal such startling contrasts. From<br />\nsouth to north, you will move from the<br />\nmost miserable, decadent slums (social<br />\nrelations majors nod meaningfully), to<br />\n<br />\nblessed as you will have it, to find our<br />\nfortunes in this cultural Mecca of the<br />\neastern United States, Baltimore. True,<br />\nwalled within the Hopkins campus, some<br />\nof us may be unaware of our<br />\nmetropolitan milieu. But you, student<br />\nwho isolates himself: yes, you must come<br />\nto realize that the world is all before you!<br />\nCome out from behind those walls, and<br />\nenter into that world beyond! If you be<br />\nthe typical uninitiated solitary soul of<br />\nHopkins, then I appeal to your latent<br />\ndesire for adventure, and to your overt<br />\ndesire for knowledge: experience the<br />\n\"happy fall\" that awaits you in getting to<br />\nknow Baltimore. It does not have to be a<br />\npainful or expensive process: and, the<br />\nrewards can be, well, very rewarding! Of<br />\ncourse, you can ignore this appeal: but as<br />\nthey say, \"You don't know what you're<br />\nmissing.\"<br />\n\"O.K.,\" you say, \"so what's to see,<br />\nwhat's to do?\" Obviously, you are in<br />\nneed of specific directions: hopefully, we<br />\nwill be able to provide some. Getting to<br />\nknow Baltimore can be approached from<br />\na variety of perspectives: there is the<br />\ncultura side (the Baltimore Symphony,<br />\nfor example); there's the \"fun\" side (a<br />\nColts game, for example, guaranteed to<br />\nbe a laugh riot); then there's the really<br />\nfun side (Kitty's Bar on Greenmount<br />\nAve., for example); and, Finally, there's<br />\nthe \"gut\" side (a revolver in your gut,<br />\nshould you be inclined to take midnight<br />\nstrolls through Druid Hill Park, for<br />\nexample).<br />\nAll of those perspectives we will<br />\n<br />\nresounds on page 11<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Paramount Pictures Thanks<br />\nThe Friends of Eddie Coyle!<br />\nRichard Schickel, Time Magazine I<br />\n<br />\nPaul D.

He also stated his own personal<br />\nview that marijuana (like all psycho-active<br />\nirugs) is \"remarkably non-toxic in<br />\nnoderate doses\" and that while it is<br />\n'inappropriate\" for the government to<br />\n:ondone its use on the grounds that it is a<br />\n'rug, it is equally inappropriate that ther\u20ac<br />\n)e penalties for \"private use in<br />\nnoderation.\" He cited several<br />\nPublications of the National Commission<br />\non Marijuana and S.H. Snyder's Uses of<br />\nMarijuana.<br />\nCannabis, which is indigenous only in<br />\nthe Mediterranean area, was initially<br />\nbrought to this country by the Pilgrims<br />\nbecause its 20 foot stalks provided<br />\nexcellent fiber ropemaking. The potency,<br />\nor THC content (the active drug<br />\ningredient) is a characteristic that can be<br />\nselected for in breeding and cultivation. It<br />\nalso depends on the growing condition<br />\nsuch as amount of sunlight. \"Marijuana<br />\ndoes not grow well in a closet or on a<br />\nwindow sill,\" he informed a number of<br />\ndissappointed students. Hence, weed<br />\ngrown over the years in Boston for its<br />\nIMSI (hemp) is- lower In THC content<br />\n<br />\nthan that grown in Mexico (Acupulco,<br />\nGold) where it has been used for its<br />\npsycho-active effects for generations.<br />\nDr. Blake cited several pharmacological<br />\naspects of the active ingredient of<br />\nmarjuana, THC. In the plant, it exists as a<br />\nprecursor which contains a -COOH group.<br />\nUpon heating, this -COOH group is<br />\ncleaved off and the compound becomes<br />\nactive. One of the primary metabolites of<br />\nTHC has also been found to be active.<br />\nThe enzyme catalyzing the formation of this<br />\nmetabolite is found in the lungs instead of<br />\nthe liver where drug metabolizing<br />\nenzymes are more commonly found. This<br />\nfact along with the observation that heat<br />\nis needed to make the precursor active,<br />\nprobably accounts for the fact that<br />\nmarijuana smoke is four to five times<br />\nmore effective than the same amount<br />\ntaken orally (such as in tea or cookies).<br />\nStudies have shown that THC is stored in<br />\nthe fat and brain tissues. It is peculiar in<br />\nthat it is one of the few psycho-active<br />\ndrugs containing no nitrogen (alcohol is<br />\nanother). However, Dr. Blake did not<br />\nspeculate on the implications of this fact.<br />\nTHC is also one of the few psych-active<br />\ndrugs which exhibit \"reverse tolerance.\"<br />\nIn other words, unlike alcohol or<br />\namphetamines, the more it is used, the<br />\nsmaller the dose needed to produce the<br />\nsame effects.<br />\nDr. Blake next discussed some of the<br />\neffects of marijuana use as studied by the<br />\ndirect administration of pure THC to<br />\nsubjects. He noted with great displeasure<br />\nthat women cannot be \"officially\"<br />\nincluded in these studies because of the<br />\nunknown effects of THC on pregnant<br />\nwomen. The effects were grouped into<br />\nfour categories: physiological, muscle<br />\ncoordination, cognitive function, and<br />\nsubjective alterations. He did not deal<br />\n<br />\nwith the perceptual effects because \"its a. oscilloscope and maintaining posture on a<br />\ncan of worms, at this point.\" Among the \"wobble board.\" Cognitive function has<br />\nphysiological effects were blood vessel<br />\npeen shown to be impaired in some<br />\ndialation and resultant heart rate<br />\nstudies using a .8 second lab playback of<br />\nincreases and the reddening of the eyes one's own taped speech as a measure of<br />\n(not to be confused with eyestrain caused<br />\nability to perform verbal tasks under<br />\nby excessive studying).

In the one<br />\narea, the oppressive sameness of the<br />\ncrumbling buildings is colored only by<br />\nthe curious kaleidoscope of garbage from<br />\noverturned cans; in the other, the ornate<br />\nfacades of the chateaux are now<br />\nillumined by a blaze of infinite leaves<br />\nparadoxically ignited by death's spark.<br />\nAnd, between those two extremes, do not<br />\nfail to notice, about midway in your<br />\njourney, your very own Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, Olympus reborn. See the<br />\nimposing frown of the MSE Library, and<br />\nthe provincially senile scowl of the<br />\nHomewood House, as they<br />\ncondescendingly look down (over a<br />\nsloping pastoral plain that rolls<br />\nreluctantly to The City below, but is<br />\nsaved from contamination by the sterile<br />\nwhite marble wall and the cold black iron<br />\ngate), to an alien existence.

For that trip,<br />\nhowever, some of you may find<br />\nyourselves in need of more explicit<br />\ndirections.

A<br />\nlack of agreement between the<br />\nstudents, faculty members, and<br />\nadministrators on the subcommittee led Homewood Vice<br />\nPresident George Benton to state<br />\nlater that the program will not<br />\nbegin as soon as was originally<br />\nintended, the source said.<br />\nDenton's proposal, drafted<br />\nOctober 22, called for a merit<br />\nsystem \"intended to reward<br />\noutstanding academic<br />\naccomplishment.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe draft read in part: \"The<br />\nMerit Scholarship Program,<br />\nscheduled to begin with awards<br />\nin the 1975-76 academic year,<br />\nwill include fifty one-year merit<br />\nscholarships ranging from a<br /><br />\nvotes<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 restnettons<br />\non activates wages<br />\nBy RICHARD LORRAINE<br />\nThe Student Activities<br />\nCgrnmission (SAC) voted to<br />\ninipose restriction on \"salaries<br />\nand wages paid by student<br />\norganizations\" at its third<br />\nmeeting of the academic year<br />\nyesterday.<br />\nThe restriction was proposed<br />\nby Seth Fellheimer, senior class<br />\npresident, as an amendment to<br />\nthe guidelines presently under<br />\nconsideration by the SAC.<br />\nFellheimer, who proposed a<br />\nsimilar amendment at the<br />\nStudent Council meeting<br />\nWednesday night, stated that<br />\n\"organizations that wish to pay<br />\nwages should show that the<br />\nservice they are paying for<br />\nbenefits the community at<br />\nlarge\"<br />\nNumerous questions arose as<br />\nto what exactly constituted<br />\nwages and salaries.\" Several<br />\nmembers pointed out that in<br />\nmany activities, especially<br />\nathletics, it is necessary for<br />\nstudent members to travel, with<br />\nthe hotel ekpenses and meals<br />\nnormally paid by the individual<br />\norganization. Also as SC<br />\nPresident Andy Savitz noted,<br />\nvoluteers at the Spring Fair last<br />\nYear were given free lunches,<br />\nwhih could possibly by<br />\nconstrued as renumeration.<br />\nAfter lengthy debate, it was<br />\ndecided to leave this point to the<br />\ndiscretion of the SAC Executive<br />\nCommittee when they review the<br />\nexpenditures of the individual<br />\no<br />\nrganizations,<br />\ntxecutive<br />\nDiscussion on the proposed<br />\nbylaws was concluded at this<br />\nmeeting after an abortive attempt<br />\nto resume<br />\ndebate on article IV,<br />\nWhich concerned the<br />\nc\u00b0 mposition of the SAC<br />\nExecutive Committee. This<br />\narticle was the main topic of the<br />\ntwo previous SAC meetings,<br /><br />\nwhen it was decided to change<br />\nthe membership of the<br />\ncommittee from the present<br />\nthree members of the SC<br />\nTreasurer, who is chairman, the<br />\nSC President, and the Student<br />\nActivities Director, to a five-man<br />\ngroup, dropping the SC President<br />\nfrom permanent memberhsip,<br />\nbut allowing him to be elected as<br />\none of the three<br />\nmembers-at-large.<br />\nDiscussion was opened on a<br />\nproposal to prevent misuse of<br />\nfunds by student organizations<br />\nby freezing funds of groups<br />\nguilty of overspending. It was<br />\ndecided to give notice to the<br />\npresident and treasurer of the<br />\noffending organization one<br />\nmonth before the freezing of<br />\nfunds takes place, thus giving<br />\nthem time to rectify their<br />\noverexpenditures.<br /><br />\nminimum of $1000 to a<br />\nmaximum of full tuition.\"<br />\nHowever, certain members of<br />\nthe sub-committee found the<br />\nproposal unacceptable in its<br />\npresent form. \"In its present<br />\nstate, I would not support it,\"<br />\nstated Gordon Calhoun,<br />\nundergraduate representative to<br />\nCAAS. \"I consider it a very<br />\nquestionable procedure,\" stated a<br />\nfaculty member on the<br />\nsub-committee who requested his<br />\nname be withheld.<br />\nThough many of the specifics<br />\nof the merit scholarship program<br />\nsuch as financing have yet to be<br />\ndiscussed, the sub-committee did<br />\nnot schedule any future meeting<br />\nto further treat the proposal.<br /><br />\n\"Approval or disapproval of<br />\nthe merit scholarships will be<br />\ncontingent upon the final draft,\"<br />\nsaid Calhoun. \"It could be \u2022<br />\nsupported if certain criteria are<br />\nmet.\"<br />\n\"I think that such a program<br />\ncan be of substantial benefit to<br />\nHopkins if it is done right, and in<br />\nthis case I would support it,\" he<br />\ncontinued. \"As of now, though, I<br />\nwould not support the proposal.\"<br />\nJohn Colmers, Student<br />\nAssistant to the Dean, also<br />\nexpressed his opposition to the<br />\nproposal. \"I find it morally and<br />\npractically objectionable,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"I still feel that any money<br />\nwhich can be raised should be<br />\nput towards financial aid.\"<br /><br />\nAid eligibility expanded<br />\nBy SALLY SPENCER<br />\nRecently announced changes<br />\nin federal and collegiate<br />\nguidelines for financial aid policy<br />\nhave expanded the scope of<br />\nfinancial aid eligibility in an<br />\neffort to cushion the impact of<br />\ninflaction on the middle class<br /><br />\nfamily.<br /><br />\nC. Wayne Hood<br /><br />\nThe changes due to affect<br />\nHopkins undergraduates<br />\nbeginning next year are reflected<br />\nin standards set last month by<br />\nthe College Scholarship Service, a<br />\nnon-profit organization which<br />\nestablishes financial aid<br />\nguidelines used by a majority of<br />\nAmerican colleges. The service<br />\nhas reduced its estimate of how<br />\nmuch middle-income families<br />\nshould be expected to contribute<br />\ntoward college costs.<br />\nThe Federal government has<br />\nalso broadened its definition of<br />\neligibility for Basic Education<br />\nGrants and has taken steps to aid<br />\nthe middle-class student in<br />\nobtaining subsidized loans.<br />\nC. Wayne Hood, Director of<br />\nFinancial Aid, pointed out<br />\nthough that the funds required to<br />\nmeet this increased need may not<br />\nbe forthcoming.<br />\n\"There's going to be much<br />\nmore need on the campus with<br />\nthe same or less money available<br />\nto meet it. The new guidelines<br />\nare good only in that they are<br />\nmore realistic. We must<br /><br />\nMore big name concerts planned<br />\nBy LAINY STEPHANS<br />\nRobin Trower and The New<br />\nRiders of the Purple Sage will<br />\nappear at Hopkins in two<br />\nconcerts this semester,<br />\nannounced Eric Rosenson,<br />\nStudent Council Vice-President.<br />\nThe SC will sponsor Robin<br />\nTrower on November 10 at the<br />\nAthletic Center.<br />\n\"Trower was formerly the lead<br />\nguitarist with the Prowl Harem.<br />\nNow he's formed his own group<br />\nwith a drummer and bass<br />\nplayer,\" Rosenson explained.<br />\nHe compared their style to<br />\nthat of Jimi Hendrix. \"They're<br />\nan excellent group,\" he stated.<br />\nThe Vice-President , revealed<br />\nthat the group was originally<br />\nscheduled by Entertainment<br />\nConcept Corp. to play in August,<br />\neither at Hopkins or in the<br />\nBaltimore area, but cancelled<br /><br />\nOther controversy at the<br />\nmeeting was incited, according to<br />\nthe source, by the presence of<br />\nDeans George Owen and<br />\nSigmund Suskind at the<br />\nsub-committee meeting since<br />\nthey are not members of CAAS.<br />\nThe deans proposed a merit<br />\nsystem whereby talented<br />\nstudents would be selected and<br />\nawarded decreased tuition, the<br />\nsource said. The program would<br />\noperate within the University and<br />\nwould not be publicized.<br />\nCalhoun, though, pointed out<br />\nthat such a system would not<br />\nprovide the benefits which<br />\nDenton's proposal would, such as<br />\npublicity for Hopkins and its<br />\nprograms.<br /><br />\nout. \"They owed us a date and<br />\nwe were lucky enough to get<br />\nthem to play' here,\" Rosenson<br />\nsaid.<br />\nThe Vice-President also<br />\ncommented that Gentle Giant, a<br />\nprogressive rock group may also<br />\nplay at the November 10 concert.<br />\nDirector of the Union, Alan<br />\nSapakie, stated the group \"has<br />\nnot been confirmed yet, but is<br />\nmost likely that they will appear<br />\nas the first act.<br />\n\"I've heard that Geritle Giant<br />\nis an up and coming English roch<br />\ngroup,\" commented Sapakie.<br />\nRosenson said that tickets for<br />\nthe concert will go ()male at teh<br />\nbeginning of next week. \"As<br />\nusual Hopkins students will get<br />\nfirst shots at tickets and get a<br />\nreduced rate of $5,\" he said.<br />\nOn December 8, the New<br />\nRiders of the Purple Sage will<br /><br />\nperform in what Rosenson<br />\nexpects to be \"a very dynamic<br />\nstage presentation.\" He added<br />\nthat \"they are a great group\u2014and<br />\ngood friends of the Grateful<br />\nDead.\"<br />\nRosenson said a new security<br />\npolicy will be in effect to ensure<br />\npeople do not bring liquor into<br />\nthe concert. \"At the last concert,<br />\nthere was a misunderstanding<br />\nover who would clean up all the<br />\nbeer cans and debris. This time<br />\nthere will be more people<br />\nworking at teh door to make sure<br />\nno one brings liquor in,\" he said.<br />\nHe was optimistic about<br />\nattendence for both concerts.<br />\n\"At the last concert, Mahavishnu.<br />\nwe had about 600 Hopkim<br />\nstudents and 1400 people from<br />\nthe community. This time I hope<br />\nwe get. more, we can get even<br />\nmore people from Hopkins.\"<br /><br />\nacknowledge that needs exist<br />\neven if we don't have the funds<br />\nto adequately cover them,\"<br />\ncommented Hood.<br />\nNext year's financial aid<br />\nbudget will be calculated on the<br />\nbasis of total cost projections.<br />\nHood estimated that it will cost<br />\nthe average resident student<br />\n$6,060 and the average<br />\nnon-resident student $5,300 to<br />\nattend Hopkins next year. These<br />\nfigures include tuition, room,<br />\nboard, travel, and other expenses<br />\nsuch as clothing, books, and<br />\nminimal recreation.<br />\n\"People who require the entire<br />\nbudget will have to take on a<br />\ntremendous financial burden. We<br />\njust don't have the funds to take<br />\ncare of them. In view of the<br />\nfinancial situations, some<br />\nstudents will probably decide not<br />\nto attend Hopkins,\" added Hood.<br />\nThe financial aid office has<br />\nasked for a total of $6 million in<br />\nFederal funds with $350,000<br />\nearmarked for- the Arts and<br />\nSciences division. Hood asserted<br />\nthat it is unlikely that Hopkins<br />\nwill receive all of these funds.<br />\n\"We're feeling the squeeze at<br />\nall ends,\" said Hood. \"Tuition is<br />\nincreasing and many students not<br />\neligible for aid before will now be<br />\nconsidered. In addition, we must<br />\ntake care of those students<br />\nalready receiving aid.\"<br />\nHood stated he does not yet<br />\nknow how Hopkins will cope<br />\nwith pressures to increase<br />\nfinancial aid.<br />\n\"We have a range of choices.<br />\nThey go from concentrating on<br />\nadmitting students with no need,<br />\nto meeting a small percentage of<br />\neach individual's need. Neither<br />\nalternative is acceptable as each<br />\nworks against the basic goals<br />\nfinancial aid is attempting to<br />\nrealize.\"<br />\nHood admitted that covering<br />\nincreasing need with fixed funds<br />\nwill not be easy. \"There is no<br />\nimmediate equitable solution,\"<br />\nhe noted. \"Through needs<br />\nanalysis, we hope to find an<br />\nanswer which will minimize<br />\nstudent frustration.\"<br /><br />\npage 2:news-1etter/november I, 1974<br />\n\u2022\u2014<br /><br />\ncampus notes<br />\nDISPLAY THYSELF<br />\nAny student, faculty member,<br />\nadministrator, or staff member of<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University who<br />\nwould like to display art or craft in<br />\nthe Hopkins Union or use the<br />\ndisplay cases in the lobby of the<br />\nUnion please contact Alan Sapakie<br />\nMitch Clarvit, or Tim Oldfield in the<br />\nnew Union.<br />\nCHURCHILL SCHOLARSHIPS<br />\nNovember 15 is the application<br />\ndeadline for the Winston Churchill<br />\nFoundation Scholarships for<br />\ngraduate study in Engineering,<br />\nMathematics, and Science at<br />\nChurchill College, Cambridge<br />\nUniversity, England.

She emphasized<br />\nthat sexuality is a normal, natural<br />\npart of life, and it was not really<br />\nthe right of one individual to<br />\nstate what is right or wrong, or<br />\nwhat sexuality really means or<br />\nrepresents.<br />\nShe went on to equate human<br />\nsexuality with the basic, natural<br />\nacts of life, like eating and<br />\nsleeping. She stated that hunger<br />\nis a survival function, and<br /><br />\nappetite is strictly a social<br />\nfunction, sex is both of these<br />\nfunctions. Also, there can be an<br />\nobsession with food in both<br />\nquantity and quality, also present<br />\nin sex. Calderone then said that<br />\nsex, like sleeping, is a natural act<br />\nand should not be disturbed,<br />\ndistorted. or twisted.<br />\nThe main context of her<br />\nspeech was her \"breakdown of<br />\nhuman sexuality.\" She divided<br />\nsexuality into three parts: gender<br />\nidentity, gender. behavior, and<br />\ngender sex response.<br />\nCalderone stated that a child's<br />\ngender identity is formed or<br />\ncreated by the time the child is<br />\ntwo years of age. The parents or<br />\nthe closest guardians of the child<br />\nhave the most effect on the child.<br />\nBy the way the child is treated<br />\nand the way the parents bring<br />\nhim up, will affect the way the<br />\nchild thinks of him or herself.<br />\nShe emphasized that a child must<br />\nbe sure of his gender identity in<br />\nthe early years, or some<br /><br />\nHousing lottery system proposed<br />\nMembers of the Student<br />\nCouncil Housing Committee<br />\nProposed a lottery system for<br />\ndetermining allocations of<br />\nUniversity-owned apartments at<br />\nWednesday night's SC meeting.<br />\nThe proposal, submitted by<br />\nSue Blum and \u2022 John Perrotta,<br />\nwould replace the sign-up system<br />\nnow in use.<br />\nThey also revealed that<br />\nhousing priorities would be<br />\nextended to students with<br />\nphysical handicaps or emotional<br />\nProblem as well as to women,<br />\nblacks, and special students who<br />\nwere unable to find housing<br />\nbecause of discrimination.<br />\nTwo to six spaces in Wolman<br />\nHall and Rogers House would be<br />\nreserved for such emergencies.<br />\nConstitution revisions to<br />\ncreate a social committee and to<br />\nprovide salaries in extracurricular<br />\nactivities were proposed by Seth<br />\nFeltheimer, president of the<br />\nsenior class. The social<br />\ncommittee proposal was passed<br />\nunanimously.<br />\nIt will be chaired<br />\nby the Vice President of the<br />\nstudent council and will consist<br />\nof all the class presidents as<br />\nwell<br />\nas members<br />\nof the student body<br /><br />\nLeah Seidenfeld<br /><br />\nwho apply and are selected. The<br />\ncommittee's purpose is to<br />\nintroduce new ideas onto campus<br />\nand act as a check on decisions<br />\nmade on social activities.<br />\nHonor<br />\nAddressing the Council, John<br />\nMcClure discussed the term paper<br />\nservices that were advertised in<br />\nthe News-letter as \"obviously<br />\nunfair to hard-working students<br />\nand others on campus.\" \"It's<br />\npretty hypocritical on the part of<br />\nthe News-Letter which has<br />\nchampioned the Honor<br />\nCommission for the last few<br />\nyears,\" he said. Ann Connors,<br />\nhead of the Honor Commission,<br />\nwas present for the meeting.<br />\nSavitz then read letters<br />\nreceived from the Attorney<br />\nGeneral of Maryland which<br />\nstated that if there were \"any<br />\nfurther attempts of sale or<br />\noffering of sale of term papers,<br />\ncriminal indictments would be<br />\nsought.\" Anyone found guilty<br />\nwould be subject to a fine of<br />\n$1,000 and/or six ,months in<br />\nprison under state law.<br />\nCPlection<br />\nThe Student Council ha<br />\nfinished selections of 65<br />\nundergraduates to be members of<br /><br />\nthe 14 committees under the<br />\ncouncil.

In the earlier<br />\nyears, again the parents have the<br />\nmost effect on this behavior<br />\ndevelopment. From the way the<br />\nparents feel about how masculine<br />\nor feminine a person should be,<br />\nwill be the extent of the person's<br />\nsexual behavior.<br />\nCalderone discussed the<br />\ndefinition of a truly masculine or<br />\ntruly feminine person. She cited<br />\nstudies done by Johnson and<br />\nConnors, who have been studying<br />\nthe sexual behavior of males and<br />\nfemales for over forty years.<br />\nThey found, that there are<br />\nfourteen aptitudes in which the<br />\nmale and female are exactly the<br />\nsame, and therefore a problem in<br />\ndefining masculinity or feminity<br />\narises.<br />\nShe stated that approximately<br />\n7% of our population are true<br />\nhomosexuals, meaning that they<br />\nwere brought up in an<br />\natmosphere of homosexuality<br />\nand it is their true nature. There<br />\nare those which are called<br />\n\"elective homosexuals\" who,<br />\nbecause of their environment and<br />\nlack of heterosexual love, turned<br />\nto homosexual sex play to satisfy<br />\ntheir needs. These people are not<br />\ntrue homosexuals, but are those<br /><br />\nwhich have been forced into this<br />\nstate by need.<br />\nSexual<br />\nShe also added that the<br />\nAmerican Psychological Society<br />\nhas decided that homosexuality<br />\nis not an illness. The sudden<br />\n\"surge\" toward homosexuality,<br />\nCalderone stated, is a direct<br />\nresult of the new openness of<br />\nsociety.<br />\nA person's sexual response is<br />\nalso affected by the parents. A<br />\nparent's attitude toward the acts<br />\nof masturbation and sex play,<br />\ncan directly influence a child's<br />\nresponsiveness, either negatively<br />\nor positively. It has been seen,<br />\nthat a parent's strict attitudes<br />\ntoward sex, can cause such<br />\nproblems as frigidity in later life.<br />\nCalderone culminated her<br />\nspeech with the new<br />\ndevelopments in human<br />\nsexuality. She stated that<br />\nHopkins and other universities<br />\naround the country have adopted<br />\nhuman sexuality as a new field in<br />\ntheir Health Science<br />\nDepartments. She also<br />\nemphasized that the basic goal of<br />\nSIECUS is to make the<br />\npopulation sexually informed,<br />\nand mature. She said that the<br />\nnew knowledge toward sex must<br />\nbe assimilated into the present<br />\nsociety in order to make the<br />\npopulation more aware of the<br />\npresent state of human sexuality.<br /><br />\nBG &amp; E accept $2000-3000 bill<br />\nBy ELLEN BERNHARD<br />\nA $2000-3000 bill has been<br />\nserved on the Baltimore Gas and<br />\nElectric Company following the<br />\nrepair on power plant facilities<br />\ntwo weeks ago.<br />\nA four-minute accidental<br />\nblack-out Wednesday October 16<br />\noccurred as a result of faulty<br />\ncapacitators in a Gas and Electric<br />\nCompany station located outside<br />\nthe campus.

My path<br />\nUpon receiving notice of my<br />\nwas assured.<br />\nacceptance to The Johns Hopkins<br />\nHowever on the first day at<br />\nUniversity during my senior year in<br />\nHopkins, I was a bit annoyed to.<br />\nhigh school, I was, as Mr. Dilger<br />\ndiscover that the struggle for status<br />\nvery elegantly expresses in his<br />\nhad not ceased.

That is why the<br />\nUniversity is not the exclusive province of its students; and<br />\nthat is why it is not those who would seek access to<br />\nits<br />\nfacilities, but those who would deny it, that are deserving of<br />\nreprimand.<br />\nThe argument advanced in favor of the restrictive use<br />\npolicy is invariably a Financial one. Steve<br />\nLovejoy,<br />\nundergraduate representative to the Library Advisory<br />\nCouncil, terms use of the Library by outsiders \"a financial<br />\ndrain\" on the Library's services. \"If we are concerned about<br />\ntuition increases,\" Lovejoy writes, \"we should be willing to<br />\nsupport such policies.\" However, use of the Library by<br />\nanyone, students included, constitutes an eventual drain on<br />\nits services. But if. students are not to be punished<br />\nfor<br />\nimposing in such a fashion, why should others? Along the<br />\nsame line, University officials have argued in the past that<br />\nunlimited access to Hopkins facilities might result in costly<br />\nvandalism. It is worth noting here, though, that the most<br />\ncostly vandalism in recent memory occurred in the<br />\n__ _<br />\nRathskellar,<br />\nafter the institution of restricted admissions<br />\nIn their attempts Lo preserve peace, elitism, and, so they<br />\nthink, financial security, University officials have imposed on<br />\nalmost all Hopkins facilities a closed use policy.

We are painfully aware of<br />\nthe connotation that \"Damie has<br />\namony, Hopkins students (i.e.<br />\n'marry a lio\u2022pV,:xn,,<br /><br />\n-J17 a t<br /><br />\ner,<br /><br />\nany<br /><br />\naspect of the<br /><br />\ncurriculum.<br />\nThere has not been any serious<br /><br />\ndiscussion of curricular matters,<br />\nexcept apparently, among your<br />\nstaff.<br />\nThere will be no substantive<br />\ndiscussion or decisions made until<br />\nafter I-assume the directorship in<br />\nthe academic year 1975.<br />\nAt that time, participation of all<br />\nconcerned parties will be more<br />\nthan welcomed.<br />\nI would suggest that you can<br />\nbest serve legitimate student<br />\ncuriosity by allowing me at least a<br />\nweek in residence, before you start<br />\nlecturing me on the basis of<br />\nriduculous rumors.<br />\nThe only preconception that I<br />\nhave about the Seminars<br />\ncurriculum at this point is that it<br />\nbe the best in the country. There<br />\ndoes seem to be a need, however,<br />\nfor an undergraduate course in<br />\nresponsible journalism.<br />\nI look forward to working with<br />\nyou.<br />\nCharles Newman<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe faculty of the Writing<br />\nSeminars take the Tragic View of<br />\nJournalism: newspapers are<br />\nindispensible despite the fact that<br />\nthey never get anything quite right.<br />\nNevertheless, we were all surprised<br />\nby the front page headline in the<br />\nNews-Letter of Tuesday, October<br />\n2 9 : UNDERGRADUATE<br />\nWRITING SEMINARS MAJOR<br />\nMAY END. Together with the<br />\naccompanying article and editorial,<br />\nit strongly implies that our<br />\nundergraduate major is a lame<br />\nduck, even a dead pidgeon, when<br />\nin fact it is merely cruising for the<br />\npresent on one wing.<br />\nIn June, Elliot Coleman will<br />\nretire as Director of our<br />\ndepartment, over which he has<br />\nlovingly presided since its<br />\ninception at Johns Hopkins in<br />\n1948. The Seminars are his longest<br />\npoem, and a fine one. People like<br />\nColeman are not replaced; they're<br />\nonly succeeded. and what should<br />\nnow probably succeed is not more<br />\nstanzas of the same good poem but<br />\nanother story.<br />\nCharles Newman's appeal as<br />\nincoming Director of the Seminars<br />\nis that in addition to his gifts as<br />\nwriter, editor. critic, and teacher,<br />\nhe has lively ideas about both our<br />\nundergrad and our graduate<br />\nprograms. The trick is neither to<br /><br />\nprograms to accomodate the<br />\nenergies and inclinations of our<br /><br />\nfaculty (some of whom are yet to<br />\nbe recruited), and of oui students,<br />\nwhose complexion doesn't hold<br />\nstill either.<br />\nAll we know for sure just now is<br />\nthat we intend our little<br />\ndepartment to be a formidable,<br />\nattractive one, with first-class<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate<br />\ninstruction. There is something to<br />\nbe said for discontinuing the<br />\nundergraduate major if, for<br />\nexample. undergraduates could<br />\ntake as many courses with us as<br />\nthey do now, or more, as part of<br />\nthe major in English or<br />\nHumanities. There is also much to<br />\nbe said for retaining the major if<br />\nwe can expand our offerings. What<br />\nmatters is that the writers in the<br />\nroom who happen to be<br />\nundergraduates get to work closely<br />\n(and for credit) with the poets and<br />\nfictionists on our faculty. The rest<br />\nis, well, academic.<br />\nSo we are talking about that,<br />\nand lots of other things, and no<br />\nfinal decisions are likely to be<br />\nmade tomorrow. Things are in<br />\nferment, as they say, with<br />\nappropriate confusion,<br />\ncontradiction, and misreportage.<br />\nbut if it didn't smell more like<br />\nchampagne than vinegar, we<br />\nwouldn't be here.<br />\nJohn Barth<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThere were inaccuracies and<br />\nmistakes in the last News-Letter,<br />\nsuch as a statement that I will be<br />\nleaving the University at the close<br />\nof this academic year.

It seems to be a<br />\ngeneral assumption that a Notre<br />\nDame student is inferior. Whether<br />\nwe are or not is not the main<br />\npoint. What we are should not rest<br />\non the name of our school and<br />\nwhat you are should not rest on<br />\nthe name of yours.<br />\nSeeing the Hopkins community<br />\nfrom the outside and talking to<br />\nother \"outsiders,\" we have heard<br />\nthe laughter at this pompous<br />\nattitude. Still, to us, Hopkins does<br />\noffer a good variety of things to<br />\ndo. But the success of your<br />\nactivities depends upon the<br />\namount of participation, and<br />\npeople who feel put down will<br />\nlook elsewhere to spend their time<br />\nand money.<br />\nAnne Battalle<br />\nLucy Collinson<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe Oct. 29 issue of the<br />\nNews-Letter has a misprint in the<br />\narticle by Paula Tarnapol.

Surely the housing<br />\nsituation was not much better<br />\nthen. Now that competition for<br />\nthe best of the Ivy League is so<br />\nheated, housing would have even a<br />\nlesser effect.<br />\nBut what really disturbs me<br />\nabout the letter is Dilger's belief<br />\nthat Hopkins'. \"acceptability\" and<br />\nour standing in Barron's determine<br />\nwhether we are \"a good school like<br />\nhundreds of others or something<br />\nspecial as in the past.\" This<br />\nstatement is full of it.

It was not until I<br />\nnoticed that many of the 'person,s<br />\npresent were in attendance in<br />\nmany official capacities that I<br />\nnoticed that perhaps the so-called<br />\nHopkins \"power base\" was a trifle<br />\nsmall. I was essentially three<br />\npeople. Associate editor of the<br />\nCourse Guide (by some estimates,<br />\na meager claim to fame), soliciting<br />\neditor of the Social Science<br />\nBulletin, and a member of the<br />\nU.G.B.

We all<br />\ntried to pretend he was not there.<br />\nFinally, someone dressed in a pin<br />\nAnd here you are<br />\nstripe suit and looking the epitome Billy Q.

The series<br />\nhas been marked by upset<br />\nvictors. Last season, the Tigers<br />\nwere rolling along to their best<br />\nseason ever. They came into<br />\nHomewood Field with a 4-1<br />\nrecord and were heavy favorites.<br />\nHowever, led by quarterback<br />\nJack Thomas, the underdog Blue<br />\nJays jumped off to a 16-0 lead<br />\nand held on to upset Towson<br />\nState 33-20. From that game on<br />\nthe Tigers' season went straight<br />\ndownhill.<br />\nThe Blue Jays surprise win in<br />\n1973 was only revenge for the<br />\nTigers upset victory in 1972. In<br />\nthat game, the heavily favored<br />\nHopkins eleven travelled to<br />\nTowson to play what has since<br />\nbeen dubbed the \"mud bowl.\" A<br />\nheavy rain the morning of the<br /><br />\ngame made playing conditions<br />\ndeplorable and the Tigers went<br />\non to capture the surprise<br />\nvictory.

Some<br />\nof them include the best passer in<br />\nthe state of Maryland, the best<br />\nreceiver in the state, the state's<br /><br />\nseventh leading rusher, and the<br />\nthird best rushing defense<br />\n(Division III) in the entire nation.<br />\nTiger quarterback Dan Dulles<br />\nis the leader of the potent<br />\nTowson State offense.

The sentiment expressed<br />\nis by no means exclusive to Mr. Young,<br />\nhowever. \"Hey it's good to be back home<br />\nagain; sometimes this old farm feels like a<br />\nlong lost friend,\"croons that paragon of<br />\nAM virtue, John Denver. Yet another<br />\nexample: \"And it's good old country<br />\ncomfort in my bones, just the sweetest<br />\nsound my ears have ever known,\" sings<br />\nElton John in a song from his<br />\npre-degeneracy days. One moment please,<br />\nhowever. A music critique this is not. The<br />\npoint to be derived thus far is that there<br />\ndoes exist a widespread sentimental desire<br />\nto \"get back to the country,\" as<br />\nexpressed in the lines above, and as well<br />\nin the sounds of countless other<br />\ntroubadors. Thus, an implied opposition:<br />\ngetting out of the city.The city, it<br />\nseems is just not at all compatible with<br />\nthe \"back to nature\" desire that afflicts<br />\nthe modern consciousness. (My God, if<br />\nthey come out with yet another \"natural<br />\ncereal,\" I'll go nuts!)<br />\nThe \"return to the country\" theme is<br />\nalmost overbearingly prevalent in our<br />\nmodern times: Do not, however, let our<br />\nextreme awareness of that notion lead<br />\nyou to believe that it is exclusive to<br />\nrecent times. To cite one among<br />\ninnumerable examples, I take you back to<br />\nthe late 15th century (before you were<br />\nborn, kiddies), recounting a fable related<br /><br />\nby Leonardo DaVinci: The Stone: \"A<br />\nstone of fine size, recently uncovered by<br />\nthe waters, was standing on a certain high<br />\nplace, where a pleasant little wood ended<br />\nat a rocky road, and it was surrounded by<br />\nherbs and various flowers of all kinds of<br />\ncolors; and as it looked at the great<br />\nnumber of stones all together in the road<br />\nbelow it, the desire came to it to drop<br />\ndown there, and it said to itself: 'What<br />\nam I doing here with these little plants? I<br />\nwant to live with my sisters there.' And<br />\ndown it dropped, and rolled to a stop<br />\namong the comrades it longed for; and<br />\nsoon it began to be in constant travail,<br />\nfrom the wheels of carts, the hooves of<br />\niron-shod horses, and the travellers' feet:<br />\nthiS one turned it, the other kicked it,<br />\nsometimes a chip was take off, or again, it<br />\nwas covered with mud of the dung of<br />\nsome animal; and it looked back in vain<br />\nto the place it had departed from, to that<br />\nplace of solitary and tranquil peace. And<br />\nthis is what happens to those who desire<br />\nto go from a solitary contemplative life to<br />\nlive in the cities among people full of<br />\ninfinite evils.\"<br />\nWell, fellow HopPies\u2014people of<br />\n\"infinite evils\" that you may or may not<br />\nbe\u2014all of the above has been, by way of<br />\ngross circumlocution, an attempt to<br />\n\"draw you in,\" to maneuver you to<br />\nrealize that, like it or not, you are now<br />\ncity dwellers. For some, this status<br />\nrepresents no change; for others, the<br />\n\"back home desire\" is no doubt the<br />\nstrongest within them. But let us all face<br />\nthe reality: here we are, condemned or<br />\n-\u2022\u2022oimr\u2022,;Ntilirak,<br /><br />\nWOODY<br />\nALLEN<br />\nA<br />\nTAKES A<br />\nNOSTALGIC LOOK<br />\nAT THE<br />\nFUTURE.<br /><br />\n\u2022416\u2018<br /><br />\nattempt to cover in articles-to-come in<br />\nthe News-letter. To start out, however,<br />\nwe propose a mild initiation, one that<br />\ninvolves the act of just visually \"taking<br />\nin\" the city around you. It's really very<br />\nsimple. First, select a bright clear day<br />\n(admittedly all too infrequent in this east<br />\ncoast climate, fickle as a beautiful co-ed:<br />\nallh, where are you, ma chere?). Next,<br />\nand this may prove the only real<br />\ndifficulty, you will need transportation,<br />\ni.e., a car. If you do not own one, do not<br />\nfeel obligated to run out and buy one (or<br />\nsteal one, or whatever). Rather, find a<br />\ncar-owning friend, and give him a dollar<br />\nor two for gas. Then, ask him to drive<br />\nyou from one end of Charles Street to the<br />\nother. O.K., so it doesn't sound like an<br />\naction-packed adventure that would<br />\nshort-circuit your pacemaker. Despite<br />\nthat, have faith. Try it, and you will, in<br />\nthe course of your drive, encounter a city<br />\nof stark, sometimes amazing, sometimes<br />\ndisturbing,contrasts. Proceed :rom south<br />\nto north in your drive (unless yob get<br />\nyour jollies from going the wrong way<br />\ndown a one-way street). In doing so, you<br />\nwill be, economically speaking, moving<br />\n\"upwards.\" Do not strictly adhere to the<br />\nstraight and narrow path; turn onto a side<br />\nstreet every so ooften, for there you will<br />\nwitness those sights that, in retrospect,<br />\nreveal such startling contrasts. From<br />\nsouth to north, you will move from the<br />\nmost miserable, decadent slums (social<br />\nrelations majors nod meaningfully), to<br /><br />\nblessed as you will have it, to find our<br />\nfortunes in this cultural Mecca of the<br />\neastern United States, Baltimore. True,<br />\nwalled within the Hopkins campus, some<br />\nof us may be unaware of our<br />\nmetropolitan milieu. But you, student<br />\nwho isolates himself: yes, you must come<br />\nto realize that the world is all before you!<br />\nCome out from behind those walls, and<br />\nenter into that world beyond! If you be<br />\nthe typical uninitiated solitary soul of<br />\nHopkins, then I appeal to your latent<br />\ndesire for adventure, and to your overt<br />\ndesire for knowledge: experience the<br />\n\"happy fall\" that awaits you in getting to<br />\nknow Baltimore. It does not have to be a<br />\npainful or expensive process: and, the<br />\nrewards can be, well, very rewarding! Of<br />\ncourse, you can ignore this appeal: but as<br />\nthey say, \"You don't know what you're<br />\nmissing.\"<br />\n\"O.K.,\" you say, \"so what's to see,<br />\nwhat's to do?\" Obviously, you are in<br />\nneed of specific directions: hopefully, we<br />\nwill be able to provide some. Getting to<br />\nknow Baltimore can be approached from<br />\na variety of perspectives: there is the<br />\ncultura side (the Baltimore Symphony,<br />\nfor example); there's the \"fun\" side (a<br />\nColts game, for example, guaranteed to<br />\nbe a laugh riot); then there's the really<br />\nfun side (Kitty's Bar on Greenmount<br />\nAve., for example); and, Finally, there's<br />\nthe \"gut\" side (a revolver in your gut,<br />\nshould you be inclined to take midnight<br />\nstrolls through Druid Hill Park, for<br />\nexample).<br />\nAll of those perspectives we will<br /><br />\nresounds on page 11<br /><br />\n\u2022 Paramount Pictures Thanks<br />\nThe Friends of Eddie Coyle!<br />\nRichard Schickel, Time Magazine I<br /><br />\nPaul D.

He also stated his own personal<br />\nview that marijuana (like all psycho-active<br />\nirugs) is \"remarkably non-toxic in<br />\nnoderate doses\" and that while it is<br />\n'inappropriate\" for the government to<br />\n:ondone its use on the grounds that it is a<br />\n'rug, it is equally inappropriate that ther\u20ac<br />\n)e penalties for \"private use in<br />\nnoderation.\" He cited several<br />\nPublications of the National Commission<br />\non Marijuana and S.H. Snyder's Uses of<br />\nMarijuana.<br />\nCannabis, which is indigenous only in<br />\nthe Mediterranean area, was initially<br />\nbrought to this country by the Pilgrims<br />\nbecause its 20 foot stalks provided<br />\nexcellent fiber ropemaking. The potency,<br />\nor THC content (the active drug<br />\ningredient) is a characteristic that can be<br />\nselected for in breeding and cultivation. It<br />\nalso depends on the growing condition<br />\nsuch as amount of sunlight. \"Marijuana<br />\ndoes not grow well in a closet or on a<br />\nwindow sill,\" he informed a number of<br />\ndissappointed students. Hence, weed<br />\ngrown over the years in Boston for its<br />\nIMSI (hemp) is- lower In THC content<br /><br />\nthan that grown in Mexico (Acupulco,<br />\nGold) where it has been used for its<br />\npsycho-active effects for generations.<br />\nDr. Blake cited several pharmacological<br />\naspects of the active ingredient of<br />\nmarjuana, THC. In the plant, it exists as a<br />\nprecursor which contains a -COOH group.<br />\nUpon heating, this -COOH group is<br />\ncleaved off and the compound becomes<br />\nactive. One of the primary metabolites of<br />\nTHC has also been found to be active.<br />\nThe enzyme catalyzing the formation of this<br />\nmetabolite is found in the lungs instead of<br />\nthe liver where drug metabolizing<br />\nenzymes are more commonly found. This<br />\nfact along with the observation that heat<br />\nis needed to make the precursor active,<br />\nprobably accounts for the fact that<br />\nmarijuana smoke is four to five times<br />\nmore effective than the same amount<br />\ntaken orally (such as in tea or cookies).<br />\nStudies have shown that THC is stored in<br />\nthe fat and brain tissues. It is peculiar in<br />\nthat it is one of the few psycho-active<br />\ndrugs containing no nitrogen (alcohol is<br />\nanother). However, Dr. Blake did not<br />\nspeculate on the implications of this fact.<br />\nTHC is also one of the few psych-active<br />\ndrugs which exhibit \"reverse tolerance.\"<br />\nIn other words, unlike alcohol or<br />\namphetamines, the more it is used, the<br />\nsmaller the dose needed to produce the<br />\nsame effects.<br />\nDr. Blake next discussed some of the<br />\neffects of marijuana use as studied by the<br />\ndirect administration of pure THC to<br />\nsubjects. He noted with great displeasure<br />\nthat women cannot be \"officially\"<br />\nincluded in these studies because of the<br />\nunknown effects of THC on pregnant<br />\nwomen. The effects were grouped into<br />\nfour categories: physiological, muscle<br />\ncoordination, cognitive function, and<br />\nsubjective alterations. He did not deal<br /><br />\nwith the perceptual effects because \"its a. oscilloscope and maintaining posture on a<br />\ncan of worms, at this point.\" Among the \"wobble board.\" Cognitive function has<br />\nphysiological effects were blood vessel<br />\npeen shown to be impaired in some<br />\ndialation and resultant heart rate<br />\nstudies using a .8 second lab playback of<br />\nincreases and the reddening of the eyes one's own taped speech as a measure of<br />\n(not to be confused with eyestrain caused<br />\nability to perform verbal tasks under<br />\nby excessive studying).

In the one<br />\narea, the oppressive sameness of the<br />\ncrumbling buildings is colored only by<br />\nthe curious kaleidoscope of garbage from<br />\noverturned cans; in the other, the ornate<br />\nfacades of the chateaux are now<br />\nillumined by a blaze of infinite leaves<br />\nparadoxically ignited by death's spark.<br />\nAnd, between those two extremes, do not<br />\nfail to notice, about midway in your<br />\njourney, your very own Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, Olympus reborn.
