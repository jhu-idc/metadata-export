His<br />\ntrack record has remained an admirable one. While the unit<br />\nvalue of the University's<br />\ninvestment pool, a figure<br />\nunaffected by inflation, etc., has<br />\nbeen roughly constant since his.<br />\narrival; earning from endowment<br />\nand equity and other funds have<br />\nincreased a full 68 per cent.<br />\nEndowment income equaled<br />\n$7,265,371 in 1975, representing<br />\na 5.64 return on investment. A<br />\nsignificant turn for the better by<br />\nthe stock market, the usual<br />\ndeterminant of earnings, has not<br />\nmaterialized; the bulk of the<br />\ncredit for the desirable state of<br />\naffairs regarding University<br />\ninvestment coffers must go to the<br />\ntreasurer.<br />\nEndowment funds at the<br />\nUniversity today total slightly in.<br />\nexcess of 150 million dollars with<br />\nother separate investment<br />\nmonies, including workingi<br />\n<br />\ncapital, adding another 50<br />\nmillion dollars to that total. 65<br />\nper cent of Hopkins assets are in<br />\nstocks and other equities, and the<br />\nremaining 35 per cent in fixed<br />\nincome securities, with short<br />\nterm notes accounting for a small<br />\npercentage of this category.<br />\nThe job of managing the<br />\ninvestments of the University is a<br />\ncomplex and demanding one,<br />\nrequiring complete, constant<br />\nknowledge of the stock market's<br />\naction. The investment<br />\ncommittee of the board of<br />\n<br />\ntrustees, headed by Robert H.<br />\nLevi, is responsible for the<br />\ndevelopment of the philosophy<br />\nand policy of the University in<br />\nthe investments area; they work<br />\nclosely with Stewart.

Our board of<br />\ntrustees and myself are very<br />\nmuch aware of the need each<br />\nyear for accountability to the<br />\npublic in this area.\" Their belief<br />\nis substantiated by recent<br />\nactions. At one time University<br />\nfinancial holdings were strictly<br />\nfor administrative consumption:<br />\nhowever they have been made<br />\npublic in the past few years.<br />\nThere was a time when the<br />\nconventional gray flannel suit<br />\nmen who ran the college fiscal<br />\nadministration were seen as a<br />\ndeterrent to the educational<br />\nmode: their emphasis on budget<br />\nfigures and cash flows was<br />\nthought to undercut the<br />\nconcentration of deans and<br />\npresidents on the more scholarly<br />\nendeavors. Times have changed.<br />\n<br />\n\foctober 15,1976/news-letter/page 3<br />\n<br />\nOn economic policies<br />\n<br />\n..notes from scholars<br />\n<br />\nOnce upon a dollar..<br />\nBy CARL F. CHRIST<br />\nPresident Ford has been in<br />\noffice for over two years. We<br />\nhave had 'a good chance to<br />\nsee his economic policies in<br />\naction.<br />\n1. Unemployment and<br />\ninflation. Mr. Ford rejects the<br />\ninflationary policies that were<br />\nPursued under Presidents<br />\nKennedy, Johnson, and, yes,<br />\nNixon. Those policies began in<br />\n1 960, and took us from an<br />\ninflation rate of under 2 percent<br />\na year in the early sixties to over<br />\n12 percent a year in 1974. Those<br />\nPolicies were followed in the<br />\nattempt to hold unemployment<br />\ndown. When the inflationary<br />\nPolicy is begun, there is low<br />\nu nemployment temporarily.<br />\nSoon inflation emerges. Public<br />\nopinion will not long tolerate<br />\nthat. The moderation of the<br />\ninflationary policy produces high<br />\nu nemployment temporarily,<br />\nWhich cancels out the earlier low<br />\nu nemployment. Our policy since<br />\n1960 has given us more inflation<br />\nthan usual, but no substantial<br />\nChange in the amount of<br />\nu nemployment over the whole<br />\nPeriod since 1960.<br />\nMr. Ford opposes the<br />\nHumphrey-Hawkins bill, on the<br />\nground that it would give us a<br />\nrenewed dose of inflationary<br />\nPolicy. It is interesting that the<br />\nDirector of the Congressional<br />\nBudget Office, Dr. Alice Rivlin,<br />\nwho was presumably chosen by<br />\nthe Democratic majority, has<br />\nt estified that the<br />\nHumphrey-Hawkins bill would<br />\nlead to renewed rapid inflation.<br />\nMr. Ford has supported<br />\nu nemployment compensation<br />\nand a modest program of<br />\ntemporary public service jobs to<br />\nalleviate hardships during the<br />\ndepression.<br />\n2. Federal spending. Mr.<br />\nFord's budget for fiscal 1977<br />\nCalls for expenditures of S394<br />\nbillion, receipts of S351 billion,<br />\nand a deficit of $43 billion. In<br />\nreal purchasing power, he .has<br />\nProposed approximately the<br />\nsame expenditures as for the<br />\nPreceding fiscal year. The<br />\nCongress has approved a budget<br />\nr esolution with higher<br />\nexpenditures and.a higher deficit.<br />\nA deficit is to be expected while<br />\nthe economy is recovering from<br />\ndepression. Mr. Ford has held<br />\nFederal spending down, and thus<br />\nhelped control inflation, by<br />\nvetoing several major expenditure<br />\nbills.<br />\nMr. Ford's attempt to prevent<br />\nreal government expenditures<br />\nfrom rising is not motivated only<br />\nhY his opposition to inflation.(A<br />\nrise in expenditures, financed by<br />\na corresponding rise in taxes,<br />\nwould not be inflationary.) He<br />\n<br />\nBy BRUCE W. HAMILTON<br />\nFrom an economist's point of<br />\nview, the federal government,<br />\nand therefore a presidential<br />\ncandidate, should have the<br />\nfollowing among his top<br />\nconcerns: (I) The proper mix of<br />\n<br />\nwants to limit both expenditures<br />\nand taxes, in order to reduce the<br />\nshare of the Federal government<br />\nin the economy.<br />\nHe proposes modest increases<br />\nin expenditures for defense, and<br />\nfor certain \"quality of life\"<br />\n<br />\nprograms such as helath,<br />\neducation, national parks, and<br />\ncrime. Defense expenditure is<br />\nnow lower than at any time since<br />\nbefore the Korean war, measured<br />\neither in real purchasing power,<br />\nor as a percentage of GNP or of<br />\ntotal Federal spending. Indeed,<br />\ndefense expenditure is now a<br />\nsmaller fraction of the Federal<br />\nbudget than at any time since the<br />\n1930's. On the other hand,<br />\nFederal payments to individuals<br />\nand Federal grants have risen<br />\nfrom 23 percent of the Federal<br />\nbudget in 1956 to 57 percent in.<br />\n1976. Mr. Ford has proposed a<br />\nslight reduction to 55 percent for<br />\n1977.<br />\n3. Taxes. Mr. Ford would like<br />\nto see Federal taxes reduced,<br />\nprovided expenditures are<br />\ncorrespondingly limited so as to<br />\navoid inflation and limit the size<br />\nof government. About 3/4 of the<br />\nFederal income taxes are paid by<br />\n'individuals, and about 1/4 by<br />\ncorporations. Mr. Ford's<br />\nproposed tax reduction would<br />\nnot disturb this ratio. It<br />\ncorresponds roughly to the<br />\ndistribution of income between<br />\nwork income(80%)and property<br />\nincome(20%)in the U.S.'<br />\nMr. Ford does not display<br />\nconspicuous fervor for the<br />\nclosing of tax loopholes that<br />\npermit persons with certain types<br />\nof property income to shelter it<br />\nfrom tax. The tax bill recently<br />\npassed by the Congress, which he<br />\nsigned makes modest progress in<br />\nthe narrowing of loopholes, but<br />\nMr. Ford was not a leader in this<br />\nrespect. He did propose<br />\nincreasing the amount of an<br />\nestate exempt from the Federal<br />\nestate tax (now at $60,000),<br />\npartly so that when the owner of<br />\na small business or farm dies his<br />\nheirs will be less likely to have to<br />\nsell or mortgage the business topay the estate tax. Mr. Ford's<br />\nSecretary of the Treasury, Mr.<br />\nWilliam Simon, has proposed that<br />\nthe entire Federal tax system be<br />\nsimplified, to close loopholes,<br />\n<br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\n<br />\nRepresentative<br />\nUNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA<br />\nto be on campus<br />\nMONDAY,OCTOBER 25<br />\nGraduate study information<br />\nall fields of Letters, Arts & Sciences<br />\nSpecial Emphasis on Humanities<br />\nContact Placement Bureau<br />\n<br />\nand to set the top bracket tax<br />\nrates at a level lower than at<br />\npresent but higher than the<br />\nactual rates paid by many<br />\nloophole-users. This would be a<br />\nconstructive step. It would be<br />\nmuch fairer, and would direct<br />\nresources away from<br />\nloophole-hunting and toward<br />\nproductive economic activities.<br />\n10 pp oses<br />\n-4. Government and business.<br />\nMr. Ford opposes the use of price<br />\nceilings and direct allocation of<br />\ngoods and services. He prefers to<br />\nhave resources allocated by<br />\nprivate choices in the market,<br />\nwith the exception of certain<br />\nobvious areas in which costs and<br />\nbenefits accrue to people who<br />\naren't a party to the transaction<br />\n(such as education, public health,<br />\nnational defense, environmental<br />\nquality). He understands that<br />\nprice ceilings create wasteful<br />\nqueues of unserved customers, as<br />\nwith gasoline during the oil<br />\nembargo, and as with natural gas<br />\nnow. His natural predilection is<br />\nfor less rather than more<br />\ngovernment regulation. This is<br />\nsound, where the regulations take<br />\nwasteful or pernicious forms such<br />\nas price controls. However, Mr.<br />\nFord is often less than<br />\nenthusiastic about types of<br />\nregulation that would weaken or<br />\ndestroy the favorable positions<br />\nthat special interest groups have<br />\nfashioned for themselves, except<br />\nin the case of labor unions.<br />\nIndeed, such favorable positions<br />\nare as often created as destroyed<br />\nby government regulation.<br />\nIn sum, Mr. Ford's economic<br />\npolicies are fairly typical of<br />\npostwar American conservatism,<br />\ncomplete with both its strengths<br />\nand its weaknesses.<br />\n<br />\ninflation anti unemployment;(2)<br />\nThe fostering of economic<br />\nefficiency in the private sector;<br />\n(3) An equitable distribution of<br />\nincome among our citizens.<br />\nGovernor Carter feels that<br />\nreducing unemployment is more<br />\nimportant than does the<br />\nPresident. By implication, he is<br />\nless concerned about inflation<br />\nthan is President Ford. Carter<br />\nfeels that the adult<br />\nunemployment rate should be<br />\nreduced to 3% (corresponding to<br />\nan overall rate of about 4.5%) by<br />\n1980. He feels that this can be<br />\ndone without an increase in<br />\ninflationary pressures, though<br />\nmany economists disagree. On<br />\nthis point, Carter's lukewarm<br />\nattitude on the<br />\nHumphrey-Hawkins Employment<br />\nBill probably indicates an<br />\nawareness that, beyond some<br />\npoint, reduced unemployment is<br />\nbought at a price of higher<br />\ninflation.<br />\nCarter and his economic<br />\nadvisors favor added stimulus (a<br />\ntax cut or a spending increase) of<br />\nabout $10-15 billion, and we<br />\nmight guess that it would be<br />\nfinanced in large part by growth<br />\nin the money supply, since Carter<br />\nhas been critical of restrictive<br />\nmonetary policy of the last<br />\nseveral months. He argues that it<br />\nis wrong to take the<br />\n\"doctrinaire\" view that increases<br />\nin the money supply cause<br />\ninflation. Yet there is fairly<br />\nwidespread agreement among<br />\neconomists that when the money<br />\nsupply grows faster than the level<br />\nof output (GNP) there will be<br />\nupward pressure on prices.<br />\nThe fostering of efficiency in<br />\nthe private sector is largely<br />\namatter of incentives and<br />\nregulations. Almost every tax sets<br />\nup inefficient disincentives. Both<br />\nthe personal income tax and the<br />\nwelfare system (any welfare<br />\nsystem) cause disincentives to<br />\nwork, and the capital gains tax<br />\ncauses a disincentive to invest.<br />\nCarter favors taxing capital gains<br />\nas ordinary income (rather than<br />\n.at half the rate of ordinary<br />\nincome as at present), using the<br />\nrevenues to ,\\finance tax<br />\nreductions for lower-income<br />\nbrackets. The Republican charge<br />\nthat this would reduce<br />\ninvestment must be weighed<br />\nagainst the increased work<br />\nincentive brought about by<br />\nreducing the personal income tax<br />\nrate.<br />\nSurely the most wasteful and<br />\ndisruptive disincentives are in<br />\ntransfer programs to the poor. I<br />\n<br />\nbelieve that there are strong<br />\neconomic reasons to change the<br />\nwelfare system in the following<br />\n,manner: (1) It should be entirely<br />\nfederally financed; (2) It should<br />\nrely almost exclusively on cash<br />\npayments rather than such<br />\nprograms as food stamps;(3) As<br />\na recipient earns some income,<br />\nhis benefits should be reduced by<br />\nonly a fraction (say about 50%)<br />\nof each increment of income.<br />\nThe third provision would greatly<br />\nreduce the work disincentive; the<br />\nsecond would reduce distortions<br />\nin expenditure patterns; the first<br />\nwould end perverse behavior by<br />\nstate and local governments who<br />\ntry to avoid welfare burdens.<br />\nCarter's program seems to follow<br />\nthese broad outlines, particularly<br />\nwith regard to (1) and (2) (he<br />\ndoes favor replacement of the<br />\nfood stamp program by cash<br />\ngrants) but I have not seen a<br />\nsufficiently detailed proposal to<br />\nknow whether he will put forth<br />\nlegislation that adequately<br />\naddresses the work incentive<br />\nproblem.. (Currently many<br />\nhouseholds make more money on<br />\nwelfare than they would at work.<br />\nCarter says this is wrong, as does<br />\neverybody, but to my knowledge<br />\nhe has not been specific on an<br />\nalternative. Reading between the<br />\nlines, he seems\u2022 to be talking<br />\nabout a negative income tax.)<br />\nThere are at least two major<br />\neconomic justifications for<br />\nregulation of industry; the<br />\nnon-existence of competitive<br />\nforces which would ensure that<br />\nprices reflect cost, and such<br />\nproblems as pollution. Railroad<br />\nrates are regulated under the first<br />\nguise; auto emissions under the<br />\nsecond. I will restrict my<br />\nattention to the first rationale.<br />\nMany economists feel that there<br />\nis excessive regulation on the first<br />\nrationale, because competition is<br />\nmore widespread than is<br />\nsometimes believed. Thus there is<br />\nno need to regulate rates on<br />\nrailroads because of competition<br />\n\u2022from trucks, barges, planes and<br />\nautomobiles.<br />\nCarter feels that, in keeping<br />\nwith his governmental<br />\nreorganization, the regulatory<br />\nsystem should be streamlined<br />\nfrom an administrative point. He<br />\nhas talked in - terms of<br />\nstreamlining regulations so as to<br />\nfoster competition, but I doubt<br />\nthat he favors massive<br />\nderegulation. He does favor<br />\nderegulation of \"new\" natural<br />\ngas on an experimental basis.<br />\nOn the question Jf income<br />\ndistribution, it seems clear that<br />\nCarter favors a more plogressive<br />\ntax structure, and a more<br />\ngenerous welfare system, than we<br />\ncurrently have. For example, he<br />\nfavors removal of the special<br />\ncapital-gains provision (used<br />\nmainly by upper-incoirr households)<br />\nfrom the income tax law. In<br />\naddition, he favors tax reductions<br />\nfor low-income people and<br />\npossible increases for<br />\nhigh-income people, though he<br />\nhasn't figured out where the<br />\ndividing line is.<br />\nCarl F.

Furthermore, it is by no<br />\nmeans clear that the concept of<br />\nreverse discrimination has any<br />\nreal meaning. It continues to be<br />\nthe subject of much debate both<br />\nin academic journals and in the<br />\npress, has been decided<br />\ndifferently by various lower<br />\ncourts, and has yet to be ruled on<br />\nby the Supreme Court.<br />\nIn addition, Dr. Muller's<br />\nconception of recruitment is an<br />\nodd one. Even Johns Hopkins'<br />\nownundergraduate recruitment<br />\neffort is designed to attract<br />\ncapable students, not simply to<br />\ninform them that Johns Hopkins<br />\nexists. A positive recruitment<br />\neffort is particularly important in<br />\nthe case of black students, as<br />\nthere is substantial evidence<br />\n(much of which is summarized in<br />\nthe 1975 report by William<br />\nBattle Associates to HEW on<br />\n\"The Supply of Minorities,<br />\nWomen, and Minority Women in.<br />\nHealth Occupations.\") that the<br />\nprocess by which blacks (and<br />\nwomen) select a career in<br />\nmedicine is very different from<br />\nthe same process in white males.<br />\nin order to be truly equitable, a<br />\nrecruitment program<br />\nmust<br />\nprovide accurate information<br />\nsufficiently far in advance on<br />\ncourse requirements,<br />\npreparations for MCATs, etc., as<br />\nwell as taking into accound and<br />\ncounteracting the psychological,,<br />\nsocial, and economic barriers<br />\nwhich many blacks face in<br />\nchoosing to aim for a career in<br />\nmedicine.<br />\nDr. Muller's remarks on the<br />\ndestructive aspects of the intense<br />\ncompetition for medical school<br />\nare telling. He calls it<br />\n\"horrible, \"' and asks whether we<br />\nwant a \"physician cadre in this<br />\ncountry who have had to<br />\ncompete almost like animals.\" He<br />\nadds that because of the<br />\ncompetition, undergraduates will<br />\n'do almost anything within<br />\nreason to get a good grade,<br />\nincluding cheat. '(it is not<br />\nsurprising that Hopkins' honor<br />\n<br />\nsystem failed when even the<br />\nresident considers cheating to<br />\nbe within reason.) But Dr. Muller<br />\nsees no alternatives, indicating<br />\neither a lack of creative thinking<br />\nor a lack of true concern for the<br />\nproblem.<br />\n__<br />\nIt should be pointed out<br />\nthat the undergraduage grades<br />\nwhich are the object of this<br />\nintense competition, the MCAT<br />\nscores which admissions<br />\ncommittees are so concerned to<br />\nkeep up to a certain standard,<br />\nand personal interviews with<br />\napplicants have been repeatedly<br />\ndemonstrated to have virtually<br />\nno correlation (and in some cases<br />\neven an inverse correlation!) with<br />\nsuccess either in medical school<br />\nor as a physician. (See H.G.<br />\nGouch, \"The Recruitment and<br />\nSelection of Medical Students,\"<br />\nin Psychosocial Aspects of<br />\nMedical Training, 1971, for a<br />\nsummary of this research.)<br />\nThe failure to implement an<br />\nactive recruitment program<br />\ndirected towards minority<br />\nstudents, coupled with the<br />\ncontinued reliance on admissions<br />\ncriteria which have been shown<br />\nto be useless as predictors of<br />\nperformance, and discriminatory<br />\nas well, shows Hopkins' lack of<br />\nconcern with its role in<br />\nperpetuating the white<br />\ndomination of the medical field.<br />\nCertainly Hopkins is not solely<br />\nresponsible for the position of<br />\nblacks in medical and other<br />\nhealth careers, but as one party<br />\nwhich has contributed<br />\nsubstantially over the years to<br />\nthe present situation, one would<br />\nhope that the institution would<br />\nrecognize its responsibility to<br />\ncontribute toward rectifying the<br />\nsituation.

Our board of<br />\ntrustees and myself are very<br />\nmuch aware of the need each<br />\nyear for accountability to the<br />\npublic in this area.\" Their belief<br />\nis substantiated by recent<br />\nactions. At one time University<br />\nfinancial holdings were strictly<br />\nfor administrative consumption:<br />\nhowever they have been made<br />\npublic in the past few years.<br />\nThere was a time when the<br />\nconventional gray flannel suit<br />\nmen who ran the college fiscal<br />\nadministration were seen as a<br />\ndeterrent to the educational<br />\nmode: their emphasis on budget<br />\nfigures and cash flows was<br />\nthought to undercut the<br />\nconcentration of deans and<br />\npresidents on the more scholarly<br />\nendeavors. Times have changed.<br /><br />\noctober 15,1976/news-letter/page 3<br /><br />\nOn economic policies<br /><br />\n..notes from scholars<br /><br />\nOnce upon a dollar..<br />\nBy CARL F. CHRIST<br />\nPresident Ford has been in<br />\noffice for over two years. We<br />\nhave had 'a good chance to<br />\nsee his economic policies in<br />\naction.<br />\n1. Unemployment and<br />\ninflation. Mr. Ford rejects the<br />\ninflationary policies that were<br />\nPursued under Presidents<br />\nKennedy, Johnson, and, yes,<br />\nNixon. Those policies began in<br />\n1 960, and took us from an<br />\ninflation rate of under 2 percent<br />\na year in the early sixties to over<br />\n12 percent a year in 1974. Those<br />\nPolicies were followed in the<br />\nattempt to hold unemployment<br />\ndown. When the inflationary<br />\nPolicy is begun, there is low<br />\nu nemployment temporarily.<br />\nSoon inflation emerges. Public<br />\nopinion will not long tolerate<br />\nthat. The moderation of the<br />\ninflationary policy produces high<br />\nu nemployment temporarily,<br />\nWhich cancels out the earlier low<br />\nu nemployment. Our policy since<br />\n1960 has given us more inflation<br />\nthan usual, but no substantial<br />\nChange in the amount of<br />\nu nemployment over the whole<br />\nPeriod since 1960.<br />\nMr. Ford opposes the<br />\nHumphrey-Hawkins bill, on the<br />\nground that it would give us a<br />\nrenewed dose of inflationary<br />\nPolicy. It is interesting that the<br />\nDirector of the Congressional<br />\nBudget Office, Dr. Alice Rivlin,<br />\nwho was presumably chosen by<br />\nthe Democratic majority, has<br />\nt estified that the<br />\nHumphrey-Hawkins bill would<br />\nlead to renewed rapid inflation.<br />\nMr. Ford has supported<br />\nu nemployment compensation<br />\nand a modest program of<br />\ntemporary public service jobs to<br />\nalleviate hardships during the<br />\ndepression.<br />\n2. Federal spending. Mr.<br />\nFord's budget for fiscal 1977<br />\nCalls for expenditures of S394<br />\nbillion, receipts of S351 billion,<br />\nand a deficit of $43 billion. In<br />\nreal purchasing power, he .has<br />\nProposed approximately the<br />\nsame expenditures as for the<br />\nPreceding fiscal year. The<br />\nCongress has approved a budget<br />\nr esolution with higher<br />\nexpenditures and.a higher deficit.<br />\nA deficit is to be expected while<br />\nthe economy is recovering from<br />\ndepression. Mr. Ford has held<br />\nFederal spending down, and thus<br />\nhelped control inflation, by<br />\nvetoing several major expenditure<br />\nbills.<br />\nMr. Ford's attempt to prevent<br />\nreal government expenditures<br />\nfrom rising is not motivated only<br />\nhY his opposition to inflation.(A<br />\nrise in expenditures, financed by<br />\na corresponding rise in taxes,<br />\nwould not be inflationary.) He<br /><br />\nBy BRUCE W. HAMILTON<br />\nFrom an economist's point of<br />\nview, the federal government,<br />\nand therefore a presidential<br />\ncandidate, should have the<br />\nfollowing among his top<br />\nconcerns: (I) The proper mix of<br /><br />\nwants to limit both expenditures<br />\nand taxes, in order to reduce the<br />\nshare of the Federal government<br />\nin the economy.<br />\nHe proposes modest increases<br />\nin expenditures for defense, and<br />\nfor certain \"quality of life\"<br /><br />\nprograms such as helath,<br />\neducation, national parks, and<br />\ncrime. Defense expenditure is<br />\nnow lower than at any time since<br />\nbefore the Korean war, measured<br />\neither in real purchasing power,<br />\nor as a percentage of GNP or of<br />\ntotal Federal spending. Indeed,<br />\ndefense expenditure is now a<br />\nsmaller fraction of the Federal<br />\nbudget than at any time since the<br />\n1930's. On the other hand,<br />\nFederal payments to individuals<br />\nand Federal grants have risen<br />\nfrom 23 percent of the Federal<br />\nbudget in 1956 to 57 percent in.<br />\n1976. Mr. Ford has proposed a<br />\nslight reduction to 55 percent for<br />\n1977.<br />\n3. Taxes. Mr. Ford would like<br />\nto see Federal taxes reduced,<br />\nprovided expenditures are<br />\ncorrespondingly limited so as to<br />\navoid inflation and limit the size<br />\nof government. About 3/4 of the<br />\nFederal income taxes are paid by<br />\n'individuals, and about 1/4 by<br />\ncorporations. Mr. Ford's<br />\nproposed tax reduction would<br />\nnot disturb this ratio. It<br />\ncorresponds roughly to the<br />\ndistribution of income between<br />\nwork income(80%)and property<br />\nincome(20%)in the U.S.'<br />\nMr. Ford does not display<br />\nconspicuous fervor for the<br />\nclosing of tax loopholes that<br />\npermit persons with certain types<br />\nof property income to shelter it<br />\nfrom tax. The tax bill recently<br />\npassed by the Congress, which he<br />\nsigned makes modest progress in<br />\nthe narrowing of loopholes, but<br />\nMr. Ford was not a leader in this<br />\nrespect. He did propose<br />\nincreasing the amount of an<br />\nestate exempt from the Federal<br />\nestate tax (now at $60,000),<br />\npartly so that when the owner of<br />\na small business or farm dies his<br />\nheirs will be less likely to have to<br />\nsell or mortgage the business topay the estate tax. Mr. Ford's<br />\nSecretary of the Treasury, Mr.<br />\nWilliam Simon, has proposed that<br />\nthe entire Federal tax system be<br />\nsimplified, to close loopholes,<br /><br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br /><br />\nRepresentative<br />\nUNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA<br />\nto be on campus<br />\nMONDAY,OCTOBER 25<br />\nGraduate study information<br />\nall fields of Letters, Arts &amp; Sciences<br />\nSpecial Emphasis on Humanities<br />\nContact Placement Bureau<br /><br />\nand to set the top bracket tax<br />\nrates at a level lower than at<br />\npresent but higher than the<br />\nactual rates paid by many<br />\nloophole-users. This would be a<br />\nconstructive step. It would be<br />\nmuch fairer, and would direct<br />\nresources away from<br />\nloophole-hunting and toward<br />\nproductive economic activities.<br />\n10 pp oses<br />\n-4. Government and business.<br />\nMr. Ford opposes the use of price<br />\nceilings and direct allocation of<br />\ngoods and services. He prefers to<br />\nhave resources allocated by<br />\nprivate choices in the market,<br />\nwith the exception of certain<br />\nobvious areas in which costs and<br />\nbenefits accrue to people who<br />\naren't a party to the transaction<br />\n(such as education, public health,<br />\nnational defense, environmental<br />\nquality). He understands that<br />\nprice ceilings create wasteful<br />\nqueues of unserved customers, as<br />\nwith gasoline during the oil<br />\nembargo, and as with natural gas<br />\nnow. His natural predilection is<br />\nfor less rather than more<br />\ngovernment regulation. This is<br />\nsound, where the regulations take<br />\nwasteful or pernicious forms such<br />\nas price controls. However, Mr.<br />\nFord is often less than<br />\nenthusiastic about types of<br />\nregulation that would weaken or<br />\ndestroy the favorable positions<br />\nthat special interest groups have<br />\nfashioned for themselves, except<br />\nin the case of labor unions.<br />\nIndeed, such favorable positions<br />\nare as often created as destroyed<br />\nby government regulation.<br />\nIn sum, Mr. Ford's economic<br />\npolicies are fairly typical of<br />\npostwar American conservatism,<br />\ncomplete with both its strengths<br />\nand its weaknesses.<br /><br />\ninflation anti unemployment;(2)<br />\nThe fostering of economic<br />\nefficiency in the private sector;<br />\n(3) An equitable distribution of<br />\nincome among our citizens.<br />\nGovernor Carter feels that<br />\nreducing unemployment is more<br />\nimportant than does the<br />\nPresident. By implication, he is<br />\nless concerned about inflation<br />\nthan is President Ford. Carter<br />\nfeels that the adult<br />\nunemployment rate should be<br />\nreduced to 3% (corresponding to<br />\nan overall rate of about 4.5%) by<br />\n1980. He feels that this can be<br />\ndone without an increase in<br />\ninflationary pressures, though<br />\nmany economists disagree. On<br />\nthis point, Carter's lukewarm<br />\nattitude on the<br />\nHumphrey-Hawkins Employment<br />\nBill probably indicates an<br />\nawareness that, beyond some<br />\npoint, reduced unemployment is<br />\nbought at a price of higher<br />\ninflation.<br />\nCarter and his economic<br />\nadvisors favor added stimulus (a<br />\ntax cut or a spending increase) of<br />\nabout $10-15 billion, and we<br />\nmight guess that it would be<br />\nfinanced in large part by growth<br />\nin the money supply, since Carter<br />\nhas been critical of restrictive<br />\nmonetary policy of the last<br />\nseveral months. He argues that it<br />\nis wrong to take the<br />\n\"doctrinaire\" view that increases<br />\nin the money supply cause<br />\ninflation. Yet there is fairly<br />\nwidespread agreement among<br />\neconomists that when the money<br />\nsupply grows faster than the level<br />\nof output (GNP) there will be<br />\nupward pressure on prices.<br />\nThe fostering of efficiency in<br />\nthe private sector is largely<br />\namatter of incentives and<br />\nregulations. Almost every tax sets<br />\nup inefficient disincentives. Both<br />\nthe personal income tax and the<br />\nwelfare system (any welfare<br />\nsystem) cause disincentives to<br />\nwork, and the capital gains tax<br />\ncauses a disincentive to invest.<br />\nCarter favors taxing capital gains<br />\nas ordinary income (rather than<br />\n.at half the rate of ordinary<br />\nincome as at present), using the<br />\nrevenues to ,\\finance tax<br />\nreductions for lower-income<br />\nbrackets. The Republican charge<br />\nthat this would reduce<br />\ninvestment must be weighed<br />\nagainst the increased work<br />\nincentive brought about by<br />\nreducing the personal income tax<br />\nrate.<br />\nSurely the most wasteful and<br />\ndisruptive disincentives are in<br />\ntransfer programs to the poor. I<br /><br />\nbelieve that there are strong<br />\neconomic reasons to change the<br />\nwelfare system in the following<br />\n,manner: (1) It should be entirely<br />\nfederally financed; (2) It should<br />\nrely almost exclusively on cash<br />\npayments rather than such<br />\nprograms as food stamps;(3) As<br />\na recipient earns some income,<br />\nhis benefits should be reduced by<br />\nonly a fraction (say about 50%)<br />\nof each increment of income.<br />\nThe third provision would greatly<br />\nreduce the work disincentive; the<br />\nsecond would reduce distortions<br />\nin expenditure patterns; the first<br />\nwould end perverse behavior by<br />\nstate and local governments who<br />\ntry to avoid welfare burdens.<br />\nCarter's program seems to follow<br />\nthese broad outlines, particularly<br />\nwith regard to (1) and (2) (he<br />\ndoes favor replacement of the<br />\nfood stamp program by cash<br />\ngrants) but I have not seen a<br />\nsufficiently detailed proposal to<br />\nknow whether he will put forth<br />\nlegislation that adequately<br />\naddresses the work incentive<br />\nproblem.. (Currently many<br />\nhouseholds make more money on<br />\nwelfare than they would at work.<br />\nCarter says this is wrong, as does<br />\neverybody, but to my knowledge<br />\nhe has not been specific on an<br />\nalternative. Reading between the<br />\nlines, he seems\u2022 to be talking<br />\nabout a negative income tax.)<br />\nThere are at least two major<br />\neconomic justifications for<br />\nregulation of industry; the<br />\nnon-existence of competitive<br />\nforces which would ensure that<br />\nprices reflect cost, and such<br />\nproblems as pollution. Railroad<br />\nrates are regulated under the first<br />\nguise; auto emissions under the<br />\nsecond. I will restrict my<br />\nattention to the first rationale.<br />\nMany economists feel that there<br />\nis excessive regulation on the first<br />\nrationale, because competition is<br />\nmore widespread than is<br />\nsometimes believed. Thus there is<br />\nno need to regulate rates on<br />\nrailroads because of competition<br />\n\u2022from trucks, barges, planes and<br />\nautomobiles.<br />\nCarter feels that, in keeping<br />\nwith his governmental<br />\nreorganization, the regulatory<br />\nsystem should be streamlined<br />\nfrom an administrative point. He<br />\nhas talked in - terms of<br />\nstreamlining regulations so as to<br />\nfoster competition, but I doubt<br />\nthat he favors massive<br />\nderegulation. He does favor<br />\nderegulation of \"new\" natural<br />\ngas on an experimental basis.<br />\nOn the question Jf income<br />\ndistribution, it seems clear that<br />\nCarter favors a more plogressive<br />\ntax structure, and a more<br />\ngenerous welfare system, than we<br />\ncurrently have. For example, he<br />\nfavors removal of the special<br />\ncapital-gains provision (used<br />\nmainly by upper-incoirr households)<br />\nfrom the income tax law. In<br />\naddition, he favors tax reductions<br />\nfor low-income people and<br />\npossible increases for<br />\nhigh-income people, though he<br />\nhasn't figured out where the<br />\ndividing line is.<br />\nCarl F.

Furthermore, it is by no<br />\nmeans clear that the concept of<br />\nreverse discrimination has any<br />\nreal meaning. It continues to be<br />\nthe subject of much debate both<br />\nin academic journals and in the<br />\npress, has been decided<br />\ndifferently by various lower<br />\ncourts, and has yet to be ruled on<br />\nby the Supreme Court.<br />\nIn addition, Dr. Muller's<br />\nconception of recruitment is an<br />\nodd one. Even Johns Hopkins'<br />\nownundergraduate recruitment<br />\neffort is designed to attract<br />\ncapable students, not simply to<br />\ninform them that Johns Hopkins<br />\nexists. A positive recruitment<br />\neffort is particularly important in<br />\nthe case of black students, as<br />\nthere is substantial evidence<br />\n(much of which is summarized in<br />\nthe 1975 report by William<br />\nBattle Associates to HEW on<br />\n\"The Supply of Minorities,<br />\nWomen, and Minority Women in.<br />\nHealth Occupations.\") that the<br />\nprocess by which blacks (and<br />\nwomen) select a career in<br />\nmedicine is very different from<br />\nthe same process in white males.<br />\nin order to be truly equitable, a<br />\nrecruitment program<br />\nmust<br />\nprovide accurate information<br />\nsufficiently far in advance on<br />\ncourse requirements,<br />\npreparations for MCATs, etc., as<br />\nwell as taking into accound and<br />\ncounteracting the psychological,,<br />\nsocial, and economic barriers<br />\nwhich many blacks face in<br />\nchoosing to aim for a career in<br />\nmedicine.<br />\nDr. Muller's remarks on the<br />\ndestructive aspects of the intense<br />\ncompetition for medical school<br />\nare telling. He calls it<br />\n\"horrible, \"' and asks whether we<br />\nwant a \"physician cadre in this<br />\ncountry who have had to<br />\ncompete almost like animals.\" He<br />\nadds that because of the<br />\ncompetition, undergraduates will<br />\n'do almost anything within<br />\nreason to get a good grade,<br />\nincluding cheat. '(it is not<br />\nsurprising that Hopkins' honor<br /><br />\nsystem failed when even the<br />\nresident considers cheating to<br />\nbe within reason.) But Dr. Muller<br />\nsees no alternatives, indicating<br />\neither a lack of creative thinking<br />\nor a lack of true concern for the<br />\nproblem.<br />\n__<br />\nIt should be pointed out<br />\nthat the undergraduage grades<br />\nwhich are the object of this<br />\nintense competition, the MCAT<br />\nscores which admissions<br />\ncommittees are so concerned to<br />\nkeep up to a certain standard,<br />\nand personal interviews with<br />\napplicants have been repeatedly<br />\ndemonstrated to have virtually<br />\nno correlation (and in some cases<br />\neven an inverse correlation!) with<br />\nsuccess either in medical school<br />\nor as a physician. (See H.G.<br />\nGouch, \"The Recruitment and<br />\nSelection of Medical Students,\"<br />\nin Psychosocial Aspects of<br />\nMedical Training, 1971, for a<br />\nsummary of this research.)<br />\nThe failure to implement an<br />\nactive recruitment program<br />\ndirected towards minority<br />\nstudents, coupled with the<br />\ncontinued reliance on admissions<br />\ncriteria which have been shown<br />\nto be useless as predictors of<br />\nperformance, and discriminatory<br />\nas well, shows Hopkins' lack of<br />\nconcern with its role in<br />\nperpetuating the white<br />\ndomination of the medical field.<br />\nCertainly Hopkins is not solely<br />\nresponsible for the position of<br />\nblacks in medical and other<br />\nhealth careers, but as one party<br />\nwhich has contributed<br />\nsubstantially over the years to<br />\nthe present situation, one would<br />\nhope that the institution would<br />\nrecognize its responsibility to<br />\ncontribute toward rectifying the<br />\nsituation. Members of the<br />\nHopkins University community<br />\nwho were, quite rightly,<br />\nconcerned with the university's<br />\nrather symbolic action of<br />\nawarding a degree to Princess<br />\nAshraf should be at least as<br />\nconcerned with the actions of<br />\ntheir university which have a very<br />\nreal impact on the lives of black<br />\nAmericans.
