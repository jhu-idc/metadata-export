Here, for the<br />\nfirst time in print, the NewsLetter will expose the deep dark<br />\nsecrets of the secret life of the<br />\nself-styled \"Baron \u2022of Pigtown\".<br />\nFar from being an international playboy, the Baron suggested that he is a cross between<br />\nAlfred E. Neumann and Charlie<br />\nBrown. He put it this way\u2014\"I<br />\nam a Neo-Deist, and, as a NeoDeist, I believe that there exists<br />\nin every individual the essence<br />\nof an etherial force. Now each<br />\nindividual must seek into himself to identify himself with this<br />\nessence; this is the existentialist<br />\ntheory that there can be no organization in the community because the force of the community<br />\ncan destroy the individual.\"<br />\nMr. Umstead's conflict' with<br />\nsociety seems quite evident.<br />\nWhen asked where he could be<br />\nfound on campus, he replied,<br />\n\"When I am not in my locker<br />\nor my briefcase, you can find me<br />\nin the Goodwillie Room.\"<br />\nWith this the conversation<br />\ntook a new twist\u2014the enormous<br />\nbriefcase of Mr. Umstead.<br />\nReputed to weigh as much as<br />\n<br />\n25 pounds on a rainy day, this<br />\nmonstrous leather briefcase is a<br />\ncarry-all for the ideas of the<br />\nBaron who claims he himself<br />\n2 pounds\u2014on<br />\ndresses out at 82 1'<br />\na rainy day.<br />\n\"What do you keep in your big<br />\nbriefcase?\" we asked the little<br />\nman. \"Why\u2014a little woman of<br />\ncourse,\" he replied, innocently<br />\ntightening his belt.<br />\n\"Rumor has it that you store<br />\nvolumes of pornography in your<br />\nbriefcase,\" we remarked. \"Certainly not!\" said the Baron. The<br />\nquestion, \"Where then do you<br />\nkeep your pornography?\" followed. An obviously indignant<br />\nUmstead answered \"Sketches of<br />\nnude women are not Pornography.\"<br />\nLeaving what seemed to be a<br />\nsore subject with Mr. U. we<br />\ndelved deeper into his cavernous<br />\ncarry-all.<br />\nIn addition to various hi-fl<br />\nselections, several Italian novels,<br />\nthree old copies of the NewsLetter, we found a portable easel,<br />\nand several tubes of dried up and<br />\n<br />\nAs a poet and a writer, the<br />\nBaron has received several national awards.

Included in these notes<br />\nare the plans for his first novel,<br />\n\"The Days: The Nights: The<br />\nPassions.\" He stresses that passion in this case is in the strict<br />\nclassical sense.

Neumann and Charlie<br />\nBrown. He put it this way\u2014\"I<br />\nam a Neo-Deist, and, as a NeoDeist, I believe that there exists<br />\nin every individual the essence<br />\nof an etherial force. Now each<br />\nindividual must seek into himself to identify himself with this<br />\nessence; this is the existentialist<br />\ntheory that there can be no organization in the community because the force of the community<br />\ncan destroy the individual.\"<br />\nMr. Umstead's conflict' with<br />\nsociety seems quite evident.<br />\nWhen asked where he could be<br />\nfound on campus, he replied,<br />\n\"When I am not in my locker<br />\nor my briefcase, you can find me<br />\nin the Goodwillie Room.\"<br />\nWith this the conversation<br />\ntook a new twist\u2014the enormous<br />\nbriefcase of Mr. Umstead.<br />\nReputed to weigh as much as<br /><br />\n25 pounds on a rainy day, this<br />\nmonstrous leather briefcase is a<br />\ncarry-all for the ideas of the<br />\nBaron who claims he himself<br />\n2 pounds\u2014on<br />\ndresses out at 82 1'<br />\na rainy day.<br />\n\"What do you keep in your big<br />\nbriefcase?\" we asked the little<br />\nman. \"Why\u2014a little woman of<br />\ncourse,\" he replied, innocently<br />\ntightening his belt.<br />\n\"Rumor has it that you store<br />\nvolumes of pornography in your<br />\nbriefcase,\" we remarked. \"Certainly not!\" said the Baron. The<br />\nquestion, \"Where then do you<br />\nkeep your pornography?\" followed. An obviously indignant<br />\nUmstead answered \"Sketches of<br />\nnude women are not Pornography.\"<br />\nLeaving what seemed to be a<br />\nsore subject with Mr. U. we<br />\ndelved deeper into his cavernous<br />\ncarry-all.<br />\nIn addition to various hi-fl<br />\nselections, several Italian novels,<br />\nthree old copies of the NewsLetter, we found a portable easel,<br />\nand several tubes of dried up and<br /><br />\nAs a poet and a writer, the<br />\nBaron has received several national awards.
