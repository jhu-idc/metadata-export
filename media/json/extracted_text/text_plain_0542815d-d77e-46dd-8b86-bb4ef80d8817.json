He soon gathered<br />\naround him a group of devoted disciples whom be called<br />\n\"doctors.\" The reason he called them \"doctors\" was that they<br />\nspent all their time sitting around the dock and shooting the<br />\nbreeze. In truth, there was little else for them to do because<br />\ndisease was not invented until 1477.<br />\nAfter that,'doctors became very busy, but it must be admitted<br />\nthat their knowledge of medicine was lamentably meagre.

Four new plants were being<br />\nbuilt. New research programs were<br />\nbeing launched. New products were<br />\nmoving into the production and<br />\nmarketing stages. Engineers and<br />\nscientists of all kinds work in 75<br />\nDu Pont plants and 98 laboratories<br />\nin 26 states.

Four new plants were being<br />\nbuilt. New research programs were<br />\nbeing launched. New products were<br />\nmoving into the production and<br />\nmarketing stages. Engineers and<br />\nscientists of all kinds work in 75<br />\nDu Pont plants and 98 laboratories<br />\nin 26 states. All of this tends to<br />\nbroaden opportunities for the young<br />\nscientist and engineer at DuPont.<br />\nIf you're interested in finding<br />\nfull scope for your ability, and this<br />\nincludes a great many special fields,<br />\nDu Pont offers you plenty of opportunity to move ahead.<br />\nSEND FOR INFORMATION BOOKLET<br />\nON JOB OPPORTUNITIES AT DU PONT<br />\nBooklets on jobs at Du Pont are yours<br />\nfor the asking.
