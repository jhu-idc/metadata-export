Among the subjects still on the agenda with the<br />\nprospective co-op are academic freedom and an extension of the existing medical service.<br />\nThus the A.S.U. takes on an extremely practical aspect. It deserves, as a consequence, the support of every<br />\nprogressive student in any attempt to improve local<br />\nconditions.<br />\nWe have always felt considerable attachment to the<br />\nA.S.U. in general. Students have need, in these troubled<br />\ntimes, for an organization ready to face fearlessly both<br />\nlocal and national problems. In the past, the Hopkins<br />\nStudent Union has fallen far short of this objective.<br />\nWe have often complained that, in effect, it was nothing<br />\nmore than a sounding board for liberal generalizations.<br />\nAt last the A.S.U. appears well on the way to better<br />\nthings. The success of its program ,is still dependent<br />\non a proper conception of practical realities. Local<br />\nevils are always much more difficult to combat than are<br />\nthe less concrete perils of world politics. For that reason, the Student Union is displaying considerable<br />\ncourage in venturing upon them.

England and<br />\nFrance now seem committed to a policy which would<br />\nallow Germany to complete the dismemberment of<br />\nCzecho-Slovakia and ultimately launch an attack on<br />\nSoviet Russia. Such an attack would mean the entire<br />\nfailure of the Soviet Union's laborious attempt to forestall the menace of fascism through alliances with the<br />\ndemocratic nations\u2014an attempt which has caused no<br />\nend of embarassment to the Communist party everywhere. Whatever personal objections we may have to<br />\nits internal regime, we cannot deny that Russia has<br />\nmade a genuine attempt to keep the peace. The impending collapse of that effort calls for an entire revision of tactics in the struggle against fascism at home<br />\nand abroad. Our only hope lies in the development of<br />\na genuine rank-and-file popular movement to stop the<br />\nmarch of fascism through international people's boycotts.<br />\nHere at home, the threat of a European war is hardly<br />\nacademic. We should proceed at once to crystallize the<br />\nexisting opposition to another foreign war into actual<br />\npeace legislation.

These<br />\nweeks have been well filled with comments and criticism from various<br />\ngroups.<br />\nI am happy to report that the<br />\naction itself was initiated by a representative opinion of the majority<br />\nof the student body. This element is<br />\nwell pleased wth the proceedings.<br />\nThe action was directed against certain undemocratic groups whose<br />\ncontrol of certain activities was undesirable in the eyes of everyone except their own. I well realize the<br />\naction we promulgated was antagonistic to certain fraternities. It is<br />\nnot hard to see their great distress. I<br />\nhave been enlighted of the fact that<br />\nthe so-called \"purge\" has put an end<br />\nto a few vulnerable rushing points.<br />\nIt is therefore only natural that this<br />\n\"pressure group\" with its bargaining<br />\npower destroyed should be up in<br />\narms. Little wonder they accuse the<br />\nStudent council and its personnel of<br />\ndictatorial policy. But to this group<br />\nI can only reply that the should remember the Student council is a<br />\nbody elected by the students themselves, and that this body deserves<br />\nthe trust and the confidence of those<br />\nwho created it. If they are not in accord with this fundamental idea of<br />\nCouncil jurisdiction, which has its<br />\nbasis student government, then they<br />\nshould transfer to an institution<br />\nwhich operates on lesser principles.<br />\nThe purpose of tins ucussion is of<br />\nan informative nature. It is to clearify for that group which does not understand why the purge occured and<br />\nfor what purpose, the motivations for<br />\nthis occurence and the facts and<br />\nreasons involved.<br />\nLet me first mare some statements<br />\neach and every<br />\nto be rememebred by.<br />\nstudent on the Hopkins campus. Take<br />\nthese statements at face value and<br />\nwell<br />\nlet them discredit the rumors<br />\ncirculated by our \"pressure groups\"<br />\nwhich have reactionary intent.<br />\n1. Neither I nor the Student Council individually or collectively are<br />\n\"acting as a mouth-piece for the<br />\nDean or the Administration\". We<br />\nhave taken past action on our own<br />\ninitiative; we intend to take similar<br />\naction in the near future on the<br />\nsame.<br />\n2. Last May I personally explained<br />\nmy views on the subject of campus<br />\npoiltics in the NEWS-LETTER. I have<br />\nhad no personal interests in any of<br />\nthe reorganizations of activities. I<br />\ndiscredit all reports and accusations<br />\nthat I have forced the reorganization<br />\nof certain activities for the purpose<br />\nof political advantages to the Kappa<br />\nSigma Fraternity or any other group.<br />\nNeither have the members of the<br />\nCouncil played politics in the vote for<br />\nthe reorganization program.<br />\nWith these ideas in mind let me<br />\nsay that the Student Council does not<br />\nwish to apologize for its actions. It<br />\nhas no reason to. If we are never to<br />\nact on our opinions, because those<br />\nopinions may be wrong, we should<br />\nleave all our interests uncared for,<br />\nand all our duties unperformed. This<br />\nhas been typical of the attitude of<br />\npast Councils, but not ours. We believe in what we are doing, and are<br />\nwilling to take the rap if wrong. Men<br />\nand governments must act to the<br />\nbest of their ability. Of this fact the<br />\nStudent council of the present scholastic year shall never be negligent.<br />\nNow, to be concrete as to the<br />\nabolishment of the Cotillion board.<br />\nThis should have occured long ago!<br />\nIn years past when there was no<br />\nStudent Activities Committee the<br />\nCotillion board operated as a business concern and was composed<br />\nof private individuals.

Instead of the football opening the year, it is the new edition of<br />\nthe soccer squad.<br />\nCoach Bobby Lyons has been<br />\nrounding his limited material in<br />\nshape for the opener. The opponents<br />\non this occasion will be the Gettysburg eleven. The time Saturday, the<br />\nplace Homewood field.<br />\nProbable Line-up<br />\nIn all probability the eleven men on<br />\nthe field for the Blue Jays will be<br />\nas follows: Dunlop or Dertzbaugh,<br />\nBrayshaw, Briggs, Hobbs, Easer,<br />\nKephart, Six or Salvia, Hoopes,<br />\nStout, Andrus, and Butt or Alperstein.<br />\nThe line has two veterans in the<br />\nfold, namely Brayshaw and Briggs.<br />\nBoth were outstanding last year<br />\nand have been on the squad three<br />\nyears. Filling out the forward wall<br />\nwill be Hobbs, Easer, Dunlop or<br />\nDertzbaugh.<br />\nWith Captain Cecil Kephart at<br />\nthe right half position and Hoopes at<br />\nthe left half post, the halfbacks<br />\npositions are capably filled. In running for the center half position are<br />\nSix and Salvia.<br />\nGoal Undecided<br />\n, In the fullback's nicks are Johnny<br />\nStout and Andrus. Stout is a veteran<br />\nand should be valuable on the defense. The other place is a fight between Frank Butt and Milt Alperstein for the goal keeper nick.<br />\nThe record that the current eleven<br />\nis out to beat is five wins, three<br />\nlosses, and one tie. This is the count<br />\nthat Lyons and his cohorts piled up<br />\nlast year. It also was good enough to<br />\nplace the home team second to Western Maryland in the Maryland Intercollegiate League.<br />\nLast Year's Record<br />\nThe edge should be Hopkins in the<br />\nGettysburg battle as the Black and<br />\nBlue hold a 2-1 win over the Pa lads.<br />\nThis was marked up last year, and<br />\nthe Jays are out for more blood. The<br />\ngames that the Lyonsmen will be<br />\nparticularly out to win are the Western Maryland and the University of<br />\nMaryland games.<br />\nThe Westminister eleven hold two<br />\nwins over the home team of '37. The<br />\nscores being 4-2 and 3-0. The College<br />\nPark team of Maryland was the<br />\nthird rival to make the Hopkins lads<br />\ntoe the mark with a 2-1. These three<br />\ndefeats and a tie with Towson are<br />\nthe blemishes the current squad are<br />\nout to erase.<br />\nTomorrow is the time and Homewood the place for the opening game.<br />\nSupport and attendance is urged.<br />\n<br />\nGriolmen prep<br />\nFor opener Rounding out the week's practice<br />\nsessions with seniors work under<br />\nthe arclights, Coach Mallonee's 1938<br />\nedition of the Hopkins eleven is approaching the opening whistle with<br />\nhigh hopes and a small squad. Due<br />\nto the size of the squad, the starting<br />\nlineup is apparently quite obvious<br />\nto experienced observors.<br />\nThe line will open with Baetjer<br />\nMiller in the center slot, flanked by<br />\nCapt. Day and Bill at guards, Vickers, and Moore at the tackles, with<br />\nlVfehling p,nd Milligan holding down<br />\nthe outer flanks. The reserve linesmen are meagre in number, with<br />\nRudo, Rostov, Zavertnick and a few<br />\nmore ready to step in, if the need<br />\narises.<br />\nThis presents the team's most<br />\nserious obstacle for a, suceesful season. A lot depends upon the conditioning of the starting lineup. If<br />\nthey are capable of standing up before sixty minutes of hard work, a<br />\ngreat worry will be off the brows of<br />\nthe coaching ,.staff.<br />\nFast Backfield Group<br />\nThe backfield shapes up with<br />\nCharlie Rudo, Maxey, Spillman, and<br />\nKersetter as the probable starters<br />\nwith Nicholson if he doesn't start<br />\nas alternate. Both the line and the<br />\n.backfield are light-weight but hope<br />\nto make up the difference in speed.<br />\nThis will probably be the smallest football squad in the recent history of the school. The atmosphere around the Blue Jay field expresses optimism, despite the size of<br />\nthe squad.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n111162M6..._<br />\n<br />\nProgram<br />\n<br />\nSportlight<br />\n<br />\nFrat Scores-1937<br />\nLeague A<br />\n<br />\nBill Day<br />\nWilliam M.

Incidently,<br />\nthe lads from the outskirts of Philly<br />\nshould be at their best for their encounter with the Jays on October<br />\n29.<br />\nWinning their opener in impressive fashion, Allegheny was humbled<br />\nby Haverford Saturday. The Meadville, Pa. team's win against Otterbein, College by the score 32-0 on<br />\nOctober 1 cast a bit of gloom over<br />\nthe Jay coaches, but after Saturday's<br />\ndrubbing there should be a great<br />\nsigh of relief coming from the vicinity of University Park.<br />\nAlleghany Loses<br />\nAllegheny's loss mght be explained<br />\nby an off-day; but there is a clue in<br />\nthe fact that last year the Meadville<br />\nteam won 13-0.

A touch shall constitute a tackle.<br />\n(The referee shall have the sole power to determine if a touch .was unnecessarily rough.

It dissolves the gum and other troublesome particles left in your pen by ordinary inks. It<br />\nmakes your pen a self-cleaner\u2014cleans as it writes.<br />\nParker Quink is full-bodied, rich, and brilliant.<br />\n<br />\nNever watery or gummy.

Yet Quink costs no more than ordinary inks\u2014small bottles, 15c and 25c.<br />\nIf you use an ordinary pen, you need Quink<br />\neven more than does a Parker Pen owner to<br />\nkeep it in writing condition. If you use a Parker<br />\nPen, you'll\u2022be thrilled and surprised by the way it<br />\nperforms when filled with Quirzk.

Last May I personally explained<br />\nmy views on the subject of campus<br />\npoiltics in the NEWS-LETTER. I have<br />\nhad no personal interests in any of<br />\nthe reorganizations of activities. I<br />\ndiscredit all reports and accusations<br />\nthat I have forced the reorganization<br />\nof certain activities for the purpose<br />\nof political advantages to the Kappa<br />\nSigma Fraternity or any other group.<br />\nNeither have the members of the<br />\nCouncil played politics in the vote for<br />\nthe reorganization program.<br />\nWith these ideas in mind let me<br />\nsay that the Student Council does not<br />\nwish to apologize for its actions. It<br />\nhas no reason to. If we are never to<br />\nact on our opinions, because those<br />\nopinions may be wrong, we should<br />\nleave all our interests uncared for,<br />\nand all our duties unperformed. This<br />\nhas been typical of the attitude of<br />\npast Councils, but not ours. We believe in what we are doing, and are<br />\nwilling to take the rap if wrong. Men<br />\nand governments must act to the<br />\nbest of their ability.

In his 4 years at<br />\nHopkins, he has been playing Jay<br />\nVee Basketball for 3 years, 2 years<br />\nof Jay Vee Lacrosse and 1 year Varsity, and 4 years of varsity football.<br />\nOther than sports he has been a<br />\nmember of the Honor Commission,<br />\nStudent Council, and at present is<br />\nPresident of A.A. Board. He is in the<br />\nSchool of Electrical Engineering.<br />\nNext year he hopes to obtain a position with one of the Maryland Electrical Engineering Co. To his intimate<br />\nfriends he is \"Punchie\". Bill also is<br />\nan All-Maryland center Chosen by<br />\nNews-Post last season.<br /><br />\nHopkins opponents<br />\nsplit over week-end<br />\nAnother Saturday has passed and<br />\nonly four of our opponents have succeeded in getting their pigskin campaigns under way. The four are:<br />\nWashington, Swarthmore, Haverford, and Allegheny. American University and St. John's will raise the<br />\ncurtains on October, 15 and 22 resipectively.<br />\nTwo Win, Two Lose<br />\nSwarthmore came through Saturday with a hard fought victory over<br />\nthe stubborn Union College eleven<br />\nfrom 1Schenectady, N Y The Garnet eleven eeked out an 18-15 win as<br />\na result of some deadly passing on<br />\nthe part of Captain Ed Jakle and<br />\nLarry Wolfe's briliant field running.<br />\nHaverford won handily over Allegheny, a '38 Jay opponent, by the lopsided score of 29-0. This was Haverford's second straight win, having<br />\nturned back Susquehanna College<br />\n7-6 in the opening game. Incidently,<br />\nthe lads from the outskirts of Philly<br />\nshould be at their best for their encounter with the Jays on October<br />\n29.<br />\nWinning their opener in impressive fashion, Allegheny was humbled<br />\nby Haverford Saturday. The Meadville, Pa. team's win against Otterbein, College by the score 32-0 on<br />\nOctober 1 cast a bit of gloom over<br />\nthe Jay coaches, but after Saturday's<br />\ndrubbing there should be a great<br />\nsigh of relief coming from the vicinity of University Park.<br />\nAlleghany Loses<br />\nAllegheny's loss mght be explained<br />\nby an off-day; but there is a clue in<br />\nthe fact that last year the Meadville<br />\nteam won 13-0. A possible solution<br />\nis that Haverford was pointing for<br />\nthis game and it was spurred on by<br />\nrevenge. If this is the case, the Jays<br />\nshould expect a terrific afternoon<br />\nagainst the Philly eleven, because<br />\nlast year Hopkins won by 13-12. Haverford should be bubbling over with<br />\nrevenge.<br />\nWashington College lost its second<br />\nstraight game to Western Maryland<br />\nby 13-0, after losing the opener to Juniata by the one-sided score of 45-0.<br />\nPerhaps, by October 22 the Chestertown boys might snap out of their<br />\nslump to make the going extremely<br />\nunpleasant for the Jay eleven.<br />\nAmerican University open against<br />\nSwarthmore on October 15 and<br />\nthe Annapolis Johnnies will, in turn,<br />\nopen their campaign against American Unversity on the folowing Saturday.<br /><br />\nJunior Manager - Call<br />\nAny junior interested in attaining<br />\nth junior managership of the football team should report to the football field at 4 p. m. any day of the<br />\nweek.<br />\n, With this vacancy open, a chance<br />\nfor the senior managership is the<br />\ngoal of all.

A touch shall constitute a tackle.<br />\n(The referee shall have the sole power to determine if a touch .was unnecessarily rough.

A Marvelous Creation!<br />\nCreated by Parker to guard pens from<br />\npen-clogging inks...Ends 69% of the<br />\nfountain pen troubles<br />\nThere is not\u2014and never has been\u2014any other pen<br />\ndesigned to handle all kinds of inks\u2014good and bad<br />\n\u2014as well as the revolutionary Parker Vacumatic.<br />\nOne reason is that this modern invention has no<br />\nrubber ink sac, no lever filler, no piston pump. It<br />\nis filled by a simple diaphragm, sealed in the top,<br />\nwhere ink can never touch or decompose its<br />\nworking parts.<br />\nAnd its patented Television barrel lets you SEE<br />\nthe level of ink at all times\u2014see when to refill.<br />\nThis pedigreed Beauty of laminated Pearl and<br />\nJet is everywhere acknowledged to be the grandest<br />\npen ever created. Yet even this Guaranteed<br />\nMechanically Perfect pen can be plugged up by<br />\nthe grit and gum in ordinary writing inks.<br />\nHence to guard the celebrated Parker Pens from<br />\npen-clogging inks, Parker experts developed this<br />\nutterly new kind of writing ink\u2014called Quink\u2014<br />\nan ink that actually cleanses any pen as it writes.<br />\nThis is done by a secret ingredient, wholly<br />\nharmless. It dissolves the gum and other troublesome particles left in your pen by ordinary inks. It<br />\nmakes your pen a self-cleaner\u2014cleans as it writes.<br />\nParker Quink is full-bodied, rich, and brilliant.<br /><br />\nNever watery or gummy. And it dries on PAPER<br />\n31% quicker than average, due to stepped-up<br />\npenetration. Yet Quink costs no more than ordinary inks\u2014small bottles, 15c and 25c.<br />\nIf you use an ordinary pen, you need Quink<br />\neven more than does a Parker Pen owner to<br />\nkeep it in writing condition. If you use a Parker<br />\nPen, you'll\u2022be thrilled and surprised by the way it<br />\nperforms when filled with Quirzk. For until we<br />\ncreated Quink and the Parker Vacumatic Pen,<br />\nthere never was a really scientific writing combination.<br />\nThose who can afford the best will not rest until<br />\nthey have them both.
