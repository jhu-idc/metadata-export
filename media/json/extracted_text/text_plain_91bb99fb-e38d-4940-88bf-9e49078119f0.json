This action must be approved by the Charles Village<br />\nCivic Association before it is<br />\nimplemented. Radar units will<br />\nalso be installed to help<br />\ndecrease the amount of<br />\nspeeding, especially in the<br />\nsouthbound lanes.<br />\nImpetus for this proposal<br />\ncame from complaints that Student Council Student Life<br />\nCommittee chairman Jon Lana<br />\nmade regarding the city's<br />\noriginal safety plan. Lana said<br />\nthat the city's plan of closing<br />\nthe single southbound lane next<br />\nto the three northbound lanes<br />\nof Charles Street except during<br />\nmorning rush hours and<br />\nstadium events would confuse<br />\npedestrians.<br />\n<br />\nity pa nts new crosswalk on 33rd Street at Charles Street.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, Laria admits that<br />\nit would be best to go along<br />\nwith the plan for now, especially since the Student Council approved the plan last year. \"I<br />\ndon't like their plan,\" Lana<br />\nsaid. \"But there is no point in<br />\nturning it into a real battle.\"<br />\nLana says that the city is being<br />\ncooperative, so the students<br />\nshould be cooperative also. \"If<br />\nwe can get [the city's original<br />\nplan] rolling maybe we should<br />\ngo along with it,\" Lana adds.<br />\nHe fears that to delay the<br />\noriginal plan will mean that all<br />\naction would be stopped until<br />\nthe situation could be totally reevaluated.<br />\n<br />\n.1SA demonstrators protest pro-PLO forum.<br />\n<br />\nDean of Student Services<br />\nChris Colombo has also expressed his support of the city's<br />\nproposal. He believes that the<br />\nnew signs would have an immediate impact, and as their effect wears thin, the long-term<br />\nplan of closing the lane would<br />\nbe implemented. Colombo does<br />\nnot believe that keeping the lane<br />\nclosed for part of the day will<br />\nbe a problem. \"I don't think<br />\nit's difficult to find out [when<br />\nthere are stadium events],\" he<br />\nsaid. He also stresses that the<br />\nsheer volume of traffic during<br />\nmorning rush hour and stadium<br />\nevents would be obvious to all<br />\npedestrians.<br />\n<br />\nnight, complaining that .JSA<br />\nmembers had been forcibly<br />\nremoved from the meeting, and<br />\nthat the program was being run<br />\nby<br />\noff-campus groups.<br />\nSpecifically, he said the<br />\nNovember 29th Coalition<br />\n(which co-sponscred the event<br />\nwith the PSU) was \"running<br />\nthe meeting.\"<br />\nThe motion passed by Council \"urged the SAC Executive<br />\nBoard,\" which will meet Monday to deal with the matter,\"to<br />\nrevoke 'the charter of the<br />\nPSU.\" The motion was proposed by Junior Class President<br />\nMike Kun, and passed..almost<br />\nunanimously, with only Dale<br />\nFike abstaining. Contacted<br />\nyesterday, Fike said he abstained because he felt revoking the<br />\nPSU's charter was too harsh.<br />\nIf the SAC Executive Board<br />\nfails to act, the Student Council can revoke the charter itself,<br />\naccording to Harry Davis, who<br />\nis both the treasurer of the<br />\nCouncil and the chairman of<br />\nthe SAC.<br />\n\"I would like to point out,\"<br />\nsaid Davis after the Council's<br />\nmeeting, \"that the Council has<br />\nthe authority to move on this<br />\n[the revocation of the charter]<br />\nunder its constitution.

Kaye<br />\nsaid that when the JSA<br />\nmembers got up to speak, they<br />\nwere forcibly removed.\"When<br />\nI got up, I was grabbed by two<br />\nnonstudents and forcibly<br />\nremoved,\" he told the Council.<br />\nKaye later told the NewsLetter that he had left the<br />\nauditorium voluntarily after<br />\ntwo other persons were evicted.<br />\nKaye said campus security<br />\nchief Robert Larkin was there<br />\nwith at least four security<br />\nguards, but that they were not<br />\n\"running the program.\"<br />\nThough he did not say exactly<br />\nwho physically removed the<br />\nJSA members, he did say that<br />\nat the time they were removed<br />\nthe program was being \"run by<br />\nmembers of the November 29th<br />\nCoalition.\"<br />\n\"To be violently thrown<br />\nout,\" he told the Council,\"by<br />\noff-campus groups is a travesty of what the University is<br />\nabout....These are people using<br />\nour University, our rooms,<br />\n*which we pay money for, for<br />\ntheir<br />\nfor<br />\nprograms<br />\nnonstudents.\" Kaye claimed<br />\nmost of the crowd at the procont. on p. 3<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2/OCTOBER 22:-191f2----<br />\n<br />\nCunningham, Thomas Discuss Media Curbs<br />\nM %Rh lit AM;<br />\nCal I homas, a spokesman.<br />\nto: he Moral Majority, and<br />\nGeorge C, unnmgham of the<br />\n!iberal group, Americans for<br />\nommun Seitse. debated Monla\\ night over whether the<br />\ngovernment should regulate<br />\ntelevision programming.

Citing a poll shown in<br />\nthe Oct.-Nov. '81 issue of<br />\nPublic Opinion, he stated that<br />\nthe media's employees were 95<br />\npercent white, 80 percent male,<br />\n50 percent without a religious<br />\npreference, only 8 percent<br />\nchurchgoers, and 99 out of 100<br />\nwere against .lames Watt, the<br />\ncurrent Secretary of the Interior. Thomas concluded that<br />\nwhat the nation sees on televi\u2014<br />\nsion is dictated by \"a small<br />\nminority of white men in Los<br />\nAngeles.\"<br />\nHe later accused many prominent liberals of using the Big<br />\nLie Theory against the Moral<br />\nMajority. The theory goes that<br />\nif a few people repeat a false<br />\nstatement so large in scope<br />\nenough times, other people will<br />\n<br />\nbegin to believe it. He denounced Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana for accusing the Moral<br />\nMajority of \"Nazi-like<br />\ntactics.\"<br />\nMr. Thomas concluded his<br />\nspeech by stating his support<br />\nfor a bill currently in the Senate<br />\nwhich would call for minimal<br />\nguidelines to be imposed on<br />\ncable and network television.<br />\nWhen asked what he meant by<br />\n\"minimal guidelines,\" Thomas<br />\nreplied that they would prohibit<br />\nthe use of \"swear words and<br />\nfrontal nudity on television.\"<br />\nGeorge Cunningham, executive director of George<br />\nMcGovern's Americans for<br />\nCommon Sense, began his<br />\npresentation by quoting Dr.<br />\n,Jerry Falwell, the head of the<br />\nMoral Majority, as saying that<br />\ntelevision should portray the<br />\nworld as it should be, not as it<br />\nis. Thomas later denied ever<br />\nhaving heard Dr. Falwell make<br />\nsuch a statement, but claimed<br />\nthat he(Thomas) would have to<br />\nreject it if it were an actual<br />\nquote. Cunningham accused<br />\nthe Coalition for Better Televi-<br />\n<br />\nThis Is It!

One<br />\nchoice is to have approval of<br />\neverything that is aired or in<br />\nprint, like the government of<br />\nthe Soviet Union. The other<br />\nchoice is to remain neutral, with<br />\nno government rule of the<br />\nmedia. He claimed that there<br />\nwas no way to partially oversee<br />\nthe media. He ended by<br />\n\"casting a vote\" for nonregulation of the media, which the auenthusiastically<br />\ndience<br />\napplauded.<br />\nThe question-and-answer session following the debate yielded little new information or<br />\nviewpoints. Thomas clarified<br />\nhis stand on the cleaning up of<br />\ntelevision programs by drawing<br />\nan analogy between television<br />\nand a water faucet, both being<br />\nitems that the public pays to<br />\nuse. He stated that he would expect the water coming out of<br />\nthe faucet to be drinkable; safe<br />\nenough for his children to<br />\nconsume.<br />\nCunningham replied that<br />\nit looked to him as if Thomas<br />\nhad a. water faucet<br />\nfetish. The audience applauded<br />\nin approval once again. Cunningham went on to say that<br />\ntelevision was an example of<br />\nthe capitalist, American way of<br />\nlife. The same free-enterprise<br />\n<br />\nsystem that Thomas and the<br />\n-Moral Majority use, although,<br />\nhe said, they wish to deny it to<br />\nothers. He reiterated that the<br />\npeople working on television<br />\nprogramming are responsible to<br />\neconomics. If a show doesn't<br />\nsell products, meaning not<br />\nenough people are watching,<br />\nthen it doesn't stay on the air.<br />\nThe use of boycotts was<br />\nagreed upon by both par,\"-: ats as a perfectly accep.e way for people to show<br />\ntheir opinions. Thomas stated<br />\nthat there was a double standard at work in the American<br />\nmedia. When boycotts are held<br />\nby liberals, the media portray<br />\nthem as heroes fighting unfairness, he claimed, but when<br />\nconservatives exercise their<br />\nrights, the media call them<br />\n\"ayatollahs\" and oppressors of<br />\nfreedom.<br />\nAfter the program was completed, many in the audience<br />\nagreed that Mr. Thomas had<br />\npresented his views more clearly and with less audienceplaying than Mr. Cunningham.<br />\nEllen Wilson, one of the<br />\nchairpersons of the symposium,<br />\nwas very pleased with the audience turnout.<br />\nThe next event is scheduled<br />\nfor Monday night.

Many of the Hopkins<br />\nstudents present felt that the<br />\nlectures consisted largely, of<br />\npro-Palestinian rhetoric.<br />\nEach speaker presented his<br />\nown reasons for supporting the<br />\nPalestinian cause. Mark Lane,<br />\nauthor of Rush to Judgements<br />\nand the most prominent<br />\nspeaker of the evening, denounced Zionism as an \"exclusivist, racist philosophy.\"<br />\nHe compared the state of Israel<br />\nto Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority view of the perfect United<br />\nStates, changing only the<br />\n<br />\nreligion. Also, he questioned<br />\nwhy the members of the Jewish<br />\nStudent Association who were<br />\nprotesting outside were not in<br />\nIsrael if they felt so strongly the<br />\nneed for a Jewish state.<br />\nOther speakers commented<br />\non the amount of money Israel<br />\nhas received from the United<br />\nStates. Brian Becker, National<br />\nOrganizer for the November<br />\n29th Coalition, blamed the<br />\nUnited States for the<br />\nPalestinian-Israeli problem. He<br />\nsaid that the United States,<br />\nunder the direction of leaders.<br />\nlike Ronald Reagan and<br />\nRichard Nixon, was supporting<br />\nIsrael not for the Zionist cause<br />\nbut rather for financial gain.<br />\nAdditional speakers included<br />\nMankekola Ngcobo, a representative of the African National<br />\nCongress. Ngcobo, equated the<br />\n<br />\nposition and actions of whites<br />\nin Africa to those of the<br />\nIsraelis.<br />\nTim Khater, a freshman at<br />\nHopkins, felt that \"It was pretty informative getting to hear<br />\nwhat they had to say, but it<br />\nwould have been a lot better if<br />\nthey had had a speaker from<br />\nthe other point of view.\"<br />\nJoe Levine, Hopkins alumnus and former News-Letter<br />\neditor, agreed with this viewpoint, \"It seemed to me that it<br />\nwas very one-sided\u2014totally the<br />\nPalestinian side.\" He continued<br />\nto say that there was \"not a lot<br />\nof information given...a lot of<br />\nrhetoric.\"<br />\nLevine feels that \"the PSU<br />\ndid a good job of maintaining<br />\norder, although some of the<br />\npeople workng for them were<br />\nslightly objectionable.\"<br />\n<br />\nPLO Forum Causes<br />\nTempers To Heat Up<br />\ncont. from p.<br />\nand that it was 'our show.'\"<br />\nAccording to Larkin, Security did not aid the PSU in clearing the passageway as it was not<br />\nhis job to deny access to any<br />\ngroup of students from a campus activity. \"Are we<br />\nbouncers?\" asked Larkin,<br />\n\"Are we hired as disciplinarians?

Rather than consider<br />\nthe proposals of the article, and<br />\naccept or reject them on tht<br />\nbasis of their feasibility, HueyMiin Lee, Sitki Irk, Kenneth<br />\nChan and Ricardo SalvattiMann chose to highlight its<br />\ngrammatical errors. Graduate<br />\nstudent concerns about T.A.<br />\nwitchhunts are valid, but making light of undergraduate concerns merely complicates the<br />\nproblem.<br />\nThe Education Committee of<br />\nthe Student Council has been<br />\nSincerely,<br />\ndeliberating over this issue<br />\nDavid Plaut<br />\n(English proficiency) for some<br />\nEducation Committee<br />\ntime. The problem is largely out Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nof its hands in that foreign<br />\nStudies<br />\n<br />\nTerrorists, Murderers, Mobs<br />\nAnd The First Amendment<br />\nHopkins students, never noted for their<br />\nactivism or confrontational tactics, created<br />\ncontroversy Wednesday night as the Jewish<br />\nStudents Association and the Progressive<br />\nStudent Union clashed over the PSU's proPalestinian \"teach-in\" discussion. Except<br />\nfor several minor incidents, the program was<br />\npeaceful. However, the highly charged tensions and emotions that ipermeated the<br />\nevent's atmosphere produced the potential<br />\nfor violence. The problems associated with<br />\nthe event raised several important questions:<br />\nshould these controversial speakers have<br />\nbeen invited to speak at Hopkins; should the<br />\nJSA have protested in the manner in which<br />\nthey did; should security have been handled differently, and how should the Student<br />\nCouncil and<br />\nAdministration<br />\nrespond to the event?<br />\nOriginally, some JSA members objected<br />\nto the fact that speakers who were affiliated<br />\nwith the Palestine Liberation Organization<br />\nwere given the opportunity to speak at<br />\nHopkins. They argued that the PLO is a terrorist organization and inviting them to<br />\nspeak at Hopkins would be tantamount to<br />\ncondoning their actions. However, to prohibit advocates of a certain politcial position<br />\nfrom publicly expressing their views is a<br />\nviolation of their right to free speech, no<br />\nmatter how repulsive their views might be<br />\nto some people. Students, especially, should<br />\nbe exposed to as many sides of an issue as<br />\npossible, so that they can make an enlightened<br />\ndecision.)t would have been commendable<br />\nif the PSU had chosen to present speakers<br />\nrepresenting both sides of the issue, however<br />\nthey were not obligated to do so.<br />\nJust as the PSU has the right to invite any<br />\nspeaker they wish, the JSA has the right to<br />\nconduct a peacable protest and to ask critical<br />\nquestions of the speakers. The candlelight<br />\nvigil and the distribution of literature outside Levering Hall prior to the PSU program<br />\nwas conducted very responsibly. However,<br />\nthe JSA does not have the right to disrupt<br />\nthe program, for this is a violation of the<br />\nspeaker's rights. Sometimes there is a fine<br />\nline between protesting and disruption. The<br />\nJSA approached this line as they attempted<br />\nto enter the L/V room equipped with banners, a flag and a megaphone. PSU members<br />\nhad to bar the doors so as to prohibit anyone<br />\nfrom entering who had the intention of<br />\nheckling or disrupting the program. Some<br />\nbrief skirmishes erupted in the foyer outside<br />\nthe L/V room as JSA members came into<br />\ncontact with people entering the auditorium.<br />\nThe potential for violent confrontation<br />\nwould have been severely reduced if the JSA<br />\nhad limited its demonstration to the area outside the front entrance of Levering Hall<br />\nwhere they had originally assembled. In<br />\nretrospect it would have been better if the<br />\nJSA had shown more restraint in their protest of the event.<br />\nThe primary problem of the evening<br />\nhowever was security. In order to constrain<br />\nhecklers and disrupters the PSU used a<br />\nsecurity force, partially composed of<br />\nmembers of the November 29th Coalition.<br />\nThe security guards acquired by the PSU<br />\nwere terrible. They were much too eager to<br />\nresort to physical violence to put down minor<br />\n<br />\ndisturbances. Physical force was clearly unwarranted in all cases. The blame for the<br />\nsecurity problems must be shared by the<br />\nPSU, University Security, and the present<br />\nprocedures for arranging security for campus events.<br />\nThe onus of providing adequate security<br />\nfor campus activities falls on the student<br />\ngroup that sponsors the event. Due to lack<br />\nof funds, the PSU could not afford to hire<br />\nUniversity Security to police the function and<br />\ninstead relied on members of the November<br />\n29th Coalition. This was a poor choice on<br />\nthe PSU's part, yet there is something wrong<br />\nwith a system that allows an irresponsible<br />\nsecurity force to police such a controversial<br />\nevent. In a case where the sponsoring group<br />\ncannot afford to hire a professional security guards, either the Student Council,<br />\nthrough the speakers fund, or the Ad- .<br />\nministration should foot the bill. Although<br />\nUniversity Security attended the event, they<br />\nchose not to take an active role inside the'<br />\niuditorium until the question and answer<br />\nwriod. While it is true that they were not<br />\nrequired to do so, their presence would havel<br />\nundoubtedly deterred disruption on both the<br />\npart of hecklers and the security force. All<br />\ngroups involved in the event, therefore, contributed to the uneasy situation.<br />\nIn response to the controversy that this<br />\nevent sparked, the Student Council recommended that the SAC decharter the Progressive Student Union thereby denying them<br />\nSAC status. This decision, however, was based on the Council's perceptions of Wednesday night's events. Their information was<br />\nprovided solely by JSA president Seth Kaye,<br />\nand some of his facts were erroneous. Kaye<br />\ntold the Council that when JSA members<br />\ntried to speak, they were forcibly removed.<br />\nThere were only two instances in which questioners were removed; the questioners were<br />\nnot recognized to speak, and were thus<br />\ndisrupting the program. Kaye told the Council that some students were not allowed into the program; no student who attempted<br />\nto peacefully and civilly gain entrance was<br />\nturned away until Hopkins security closed<br />\nthe doors. The PSU, despite security problems, did the best they could to prevent<br />\nviolence from occurring at the meeting.<br />\nThe Council's action was made hastily;<br />\nthey had made a decision before the PSU<br />\nprogram was completed. It was based on<br />\nhalf-truths; some of their information wasincorrect, and they never consulted the PSU.<br />\nThe decision was a bad one.<br />\nOnce the facts have been re-examined, it<br />\nwill be clear that the case to decharter the<br />\nPSU is weak. Certainly the PSU made some<br />\nerrors, but no student group has ever<br />\noperated without making some mistakes.<br />\nSince both the Student Council and the SAC<br />\nExecutive Board have shown themselves to<br />\nbe rational, deliberative bodies, it is unlikely that either would vote to decharter the<br />\nPSU.<br />\nWednesday night was a bad night for clear<br />\nthinking. Everyone made errors in judgment.<br />\nNo one was without fault, and no one was<br />\ntotally to blame. Hopefully all involved will<br />\nlearn from their mistakes and they will not<br />\nrecur.

Hopkins succeeded in<br />\nsaving the institution from the<br />\nmoral decay of \"hardcore\"pornographic cinematography,<br />\nand thereby set a precedent for<br />\nthe future of pornography and<br />\neroticism on campus. Last<br />\nyear's showing of Debbie Does<br />\nDallas, an example of porn at<br />\nwhat could possibly be called its<br />\nmost boring, may have been the<br />\nlast time the dregs of the Block<br />\nattempted to move uptown.<br />\nPornography has died on the<br />\nthreshold of The Johns<br />\nHopkins University and all the<br />\nschool's good little students are<br />\nsafe. Or are they?<br />\nIn the deliberations on<br />\nwhether or not to show Deep<br />\nThroat, the possibility was raised that some members of the<br />\nHopkins community might be<br />\noffended, particularly the<br />\nwomen. If certain people would<br />\nhave been offended by such a<br />\nshowing, they could have simply banned the film, although I<br />\ndo resent that women were<br />\nsingled out as the collective<br />\npurveyors of pornographic<br />\nrepression. No one would have<br />\nbeen forcing anyone to see it,<br />\nwhereas by not showing the<br />\nfilm, you are \"forcing\" those<br />\nwho want to see it not to.<br />\nWhat worries me most about<br />\nthis is that the people who cannot see pornography on campus<br />\nwill go find it somewhere else,<br />\nwhere thay are exposed to more<br />\nthan just a dirty picture. While<br />\nHopkins may be attempting to<br />\n\"protect\" its students, it may<br />\nonly be inducing them to jump<br />\ninto the proverbial fire of the<br />\nBlock. In particular, Hopkins<br />\nwould be one of the few acceptable places for women to view<br />\nporn. Admittedly, not every<br />\nwoman enjoys it, but I would<br />\nguess that many are curious<br />\nabout it. A woman could go<br />\nalone to a pornographic film<br />\nshown at Hopkins and feel<br />\nsafe; how many women do you<br />\nknow who would hazard a trip<br />\ndowntown\u2014even in a group\u2014<br />\nto see a porno flick on East<br />\nBaltimore Street? Hopkins<br />\ncould provide a safe environment to satisfy this basic<br />\ncuriosity.<br />\n<br />\nnography,\" \"Eroticism is for bored with the repetitious ac[love]; pornography is against tion of porn.

My major<br />\ncontribution was in an earlier<br />\nbook, a more technical book,<br />\nwritten in 1979. The 1981 book,<br />\nThe New<br />\nEvolutionary<br />\nTimetable, was actually a statement of the controversy as I<br />\nhave seen it. It was a review of<br />\nsome of the arguments.

I said more about<br />\nhuman evolution, how I think<br />\nit (puntuational equilibrium)<br />\napplied to that. I talked about<br />\nsome of the historical aspects of<br />\nthe controversy. I tried to<br />\nanalyze the reasons people<br />\navoided a puntuational view for<br />\nmany decades. It had surfaced<br />\nin many forms, some of them<br />\nrather extreme, at various<br />\ntimes. It had never really taken<br />\nhold.

It<br />\nhas been overstated even by<br />\nscientists, who seem somehow<br />\nto misinterpret what people are<br />\nsaying. There's nothing in the<br />\npunctuational view that says<br />\nnatural selection may not be<br />\nproducing all evolutionary<br />\nchange that is displayed in the<br />\nfossil record. The punctuational view says that most<br />\nevolutionary change is concentrated in brief episodes of rapid<br />\nchange of populations. That<br />\nmay be primarily the result of<br />\nnatural selection, and probably<br />\nis. There may be other mechanisms involved as well. But<br />\nthere's nothing in the punctuational view that requires<br />\nanything but natural selection.<br />\nWe're really talking about a<br />\npattern. Details of what's happening in these small populations still remain to be worked<br />\nout. Undoubtedly, natural<br />\nselection plays a major role;<br />\nwhether it's overwhelmingly<br />\nimportant is not certain.<br />\nN-L: Between \"events,\"<br />\ngradual evolution is still<br />\npossible.<br />\nStanley: Some gradual evolution still goes on because<br />\nnothing remains perfectly still<br />\nin nature. The question is how<br />\nmuch goes on and how important it is. The traditional view<br />\nhas been that species of the sort<br />\nthat occur all around us are<br />\nconstantly changing in significant ways. They are undergoing<br />\nchange in significant ways.<br />\nThey are undergoing change in<br />\nresponse to environmental<br />\nchange. These changes are<br />\nthought of as changes that are<br />\ncontinuously adapting them to<br />\nthe environment as it changes.<br />\nUndoubtedly some changes do<br />\noccur. These are changes going<br />\non in the species. But my view,<br />\nfrom looking at the fossil<br />\nrecord is that such changes are<br />\nvery, very slight. They don't<br />\nmeet environmental changes.<br />\nSpecies are lasting, once wellestablished, for one hundred<br />\nthousand, one million, or ten<br />\nmillion generations, without<br />\nchanging enough that we would<br />\ncall them by new species names.<br />\nThere must be a little bit of fine<br />\ntuning going on, but it's not as<br />\nsignificant as people have<br />\nbelieved. Most species that are<br />\nwell-established aren't constantly being remodeled such<br />\nthat within a .few thousand or<br />\na few tens of thousands of<br />\ngenerations they are totally<br />\ntransformed.<br />\nN-L: Has there ever been a case<br />\npresented where one species,<br />\nwithout the help of one large<br />\nmutation, gradually changed<br />\ninto another species? There is<br />\nno gap. At the \"beginning\" it<br />\nis recognized as one species and<br />\nat the \"end\" it is recognized as<br />\nanother.<br />\nStanley: There are some possible examples, but before continuing let me correct a misapprehension. The punctuational<br />\n<br />\nview does not rely on single<br />\nmutations, necessarily. Transformations may involve several<br />\nmutations. Maybe one or two<br />\nare particularly important,<br />\nwhile others are of secondary<br />\nimportance. As far as the more<br />\ngeneral question, of the<br />\ntransformation of an entire<br />\nspecies, there are a few examples on record of instances<br />\nthat look as if they might represent such change. Whether<br />\nthey're valid is in some cases<br />\ndebatable, and in other cases<br />\nthey look to be fairly solid. If<br />\nit requires several million years<br />\nfor such a transformation to<br />\ntake place it's very slow evolution with regard to the more<br />\ndramatic evolutionary events in<br />\nthe history of life. The total<br />\namount of change contributed<br />\nby these transformations is<br />\nmodest. It's much less than half<br />\nof the total change.<br />\nN-L: How,in your view, would<br />\nan order or a larger unit of<br />\nclassification arise\u2014even a<br />\nphylum? I can think of some<br />\nexamples where, unless you do<br />\nas Darwin did and blame the<br />\nfossil record, there are large<br />\nanatomical gaps. For instance,<br />\nCrossopterygians and Ichthyostega (Ichthyostega is the earliest<br />\nknown amphibian, Crossoptery<br />\ngian an advanced fish recognized as being Ichthyostega's<br />\nclosest known related ancestor).<br />\nThere's very little time to make<br />\nsuch a large jump.<br />\nStanley: There's a complete<br />\nspectrum of possibilites. Is<br />\nthere just one or a small<br />\nnumber of large steps giving<br />\nrise to another class, order or<br />\nphylum? Or, are there lots of<br />\nsmall steps? It's not entirely<br />\nclear. My view is that it's difficult to invoke a large number<br />\nof small steps in many cases.<br />\nUltimately, there are two problems. One is, why species,<br />\nonce they're well-established,<br />\nare stable and tend not to<br />\nevolve very rapidly?. The other<br />\nside of the coin is how do these<br />\nrapid changes occur in small<br />\npopulations? Until we recog<br />\nnize what goes on, the question<br />\nyou're asking is not fully<br />\nanswered. It may be the result<br />\nof very intense natural selection<br />\nopeating on very small populations. My personal feeling is<br />\nwhat happens is, you have to<br />\nremove the population from the<br />\nnormal environment in which it<br />\nlives. Then it's most likely to<br />\nget these sorts of transformations in populations that, for<br />\none reason or another, are in<br />\nunusual environmental settings.<br />\nThis may not be physical environment I'm talking about,<br />\nbut biological environment. It<br />\nappears to me that one of the<br />\nobstacles to a major transformation in a large species is<br />\nsimply thete are lots of interactions among genes. Imagine<br />\nthat you have a particular<br />\ngenetic change that might have<br />\nimportant effects on adaptation.

Rochelle Evans<br />\nI gave Rochelle a hickey on our<br />\nFirst date even though I really didn't<br />\nknow how to do it. There were so<br />\nmany teethmarks in her neck that it<br />\nlooked like she had been ravaged by<br />\nwolves. You know how girls wear<br />\nscarves to school when they have<br />\nhickeys? Well, she had to wear a<br />\nsheet for about a month. What was<br />\nworse, though, was that I did some<br />\ndamage to her larynx and she had to<br />\nhave surgery to save her voice.<br />\nEveryone says she sounds like Mr. Ed<br />\nnow, but I wouldn't know since she<br />\nalways hangs up when I call, even<br />\nwhen I disguise my voice.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n2. My Aunt Peg<br />\nMy little sister Joanie and I chipped in to get her some electrolysis last<br />\nChristmas. She wasn't one of our<br />\nFavorite relatives anyhow, so we really didn't care too much when she ran<br />\nupstairs crying and refused to come<br />\ndown for the turkey and stuffing.<br />\n3. Elaine Villa<br />\nI hid in Elaine's gym locker one<br />\nJay hoping to surprise her when she<br />\ngot back from playing field hockey.<br />\nBut, I didn't know that girls take<br />\ntheir showers before they go back to<br />\ntheir lockers.

On the night of the party I hid<br />\nin the shrubs beside her house, and,<br />\nwhen everyone was out on the patio,<br />\nI heaved a big bottle of red dye into<br />\nthe pool. Mr. Bentley had to hire a<br />\ncouple of divers to scrub the pool.<br />\nMy mom had accidentally slipped my<br />\ninvitation into her purse and it had<br />\nbeen there the whole time.<br />\n6.

She could have<br />\nplayed along, but she started crying<br />\nin front of everyone and we all realized that he really was her brother.<br />\nBecause everyone started yelling<br />\n\"Hefter Skelter\" whenever they saw<br />\nher, she developed this really<br />\nfrightening facial twitch and needed<br />\nto undergo therapy. I'm sorry about<br />\nthis one, I swear.<br />\n10. Lynn Wallingford<br />\nRemember how you used to show<br />\noff to impress girls in junior high?<br />\nWell, during an indoor recess (it was<br />\nsnowing out), I was shooting pencils<br />\nacross the cafeteria with a rubber<br />\nband. I'm pretty sure that she was<br />\nimpressed by it (she even yelled out,<br />\n\"Why don't you cut the crap?\") until one of the pencils punctured her<br />\nleft eardrum. Then, like a baby, she<br />\nstarted whining until a teacher showed up, and I ended up getting two<br />\nweeks of detention.<br />\n11. Carolyn Sherman<br />\nI sent her a bottle of maple syrup<br />\non Valentine's Day.<br />\n12. Some girl who was in Baker last<br />\nyear (I think she said her name was<br />\nSharon, but I don't remember)<br />\nOne night, my friends and I were<br />\npretty bored, so we decided to fool<br />\naround and call up the dorms. Well,<br />\nthis girl answered the phone and I<br />\ntold her that I was a member of<br />\nAlpha Kappa Nu fraternity(\"The Nu<br />\nfrat on campus!\"). Then I invited her<br />\nto our upcoming party, Knockwurst<br />\nNight(\"Bring your own condiments!\"). Then one of my friends<br />\ngrabbed the phone and told her who<br />\nI was and that I had made the whole<br />\nthing up. I was very embarrassed.<br />\n<br />\n13. Tracy Pestler<br />\nTim Pestler, Tracy's brother, was<br />\none of my good friends in high school<br />\n(he became my very best friend in the<br />\nwhole world when I found out that<br />\nTracy was his sister), so I used to<br />\nhang out at her house a lot. Anyhow,<br />\nonce she and her mom came back<br />\nearlier than they were supposed to<br />\nfrom shopping, and Tracy caught me<br />\ntrying on her beige jumpsuit in her<br />\nbedroom. I think she threw the jumpsuit out after that.<br />\n14.

In July, however, he officially<br />\ntransferred to a full-time position<br />\nwith the Writing Seminars Department. Arellano has masters degrees<br />\nin both Chemistry(M.I.T. 1946)and<br />\nWriting Seminars(J.H.U. 1962), but,<br />\nsince his \"first love is playwriting,\"<br />\nhe gave up the life of a chemist for<br />\nthe life of a writer.<br />\nArellano has been at Hopkins since<br />\n1962, working, researching and<br />\nteaching. He began the Introduction<br />\nto Playwriting class in 1970, and since<br />\nthen has been working in both the<br />\nChemistry and Writing Seminars<br />\ndepartments. However, \"It was really difficult to keep up with both, the<br />\nwork load got to be too heavy.\" So<br />\nArellano chose between the two. It<br />\ntook two years for him to make the<br />\ntransition to the Writing Seminars<br />\nDepartment because the Chemistry<br />\nDepartment had trouble finding a<br />\nreplacement for him.<br />\nArellano's present position is that<br />\nof Director of Undergraduate Studies<br />\nin the Writing Seminars Department.<br />\nIn addition, he supervises the film<br />\ncourses and all sections of Contemporary American Letters. It was<br />\nArellano who established the practice<br />\nof having M.A. candidates come to<br />\nHopkins a week early in the fall for<br />\na workshop in teaching. \"I felt that<br />\nit was important for them to get a feel<br />\nfor teaching before they started out<br />\nas TAs\" he said.<br />\nOne of Arellano's foremost<br />\nresponsibilities is to head the advising program for Writing Seminars<br />\nmajors. He is the faculty advisor for<br />\n<br />\nall 49 undergraduates. \"I think [advising] is one of my most important<br />\njobs. I try to get to know each one<br />\nof my students personally, and once<br />\nI do, I have no trouble keeping up<br />\nwith them. Four years is plenty of<br />\ntime to establish strong working<br />\nrelationships.\"<br />\nIn addition, Arellano plans and<br />\ncoordinates many projects that fall<br />\noutside of the academic structure.<br />\nThree years ago, when he learned that<br />\nthere was some money available from<br />\nthe Keenan Fund, he established the<br />\nKeenan Awards, which are given<br />\nyearly to undergraduates for creative<br />\nwork. \"I've always been interested in<br />\nthe undergrads at Hopkins, and competitions like the Keenan Awards are<br />\nmeant to be an encouragement to<br />\nthem. I want to create a desire in the<br />\nundergrads to present good, polished works. That's what education is all<br />\nabout.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"I would really like<br />\nto see more scientists participate in<br />\nactivities sponsored<br />\nby our department.<br />\nYou don't have to<br />\nbe an expert or<br />\neven that good a<br />\nwriter to have fun<br />\nand learn.\"<br />\nLast year, the scope of the competition was enlarged to include<br />\ngraphics and film as well as the<br />\noriginal three catagories of<br />\nplaywriting, fiction and poetry.<br />\nArellano judges the entries himself.<br />\n<br />\n\fDrama, fish, And Other Things<br />\n\"Usually what happens in competitions such as this is that the juniors<br />\nand seniors, who have more experience, end up winning most of the<br />\nawards. I want to encourage<br />\nsophomores,<br />\nfreshmen,<br />\nand less experienced writers also;<br />\nentering a competition should be a<br />\npositive experience.\"<br />\n<br />\nhave a number of young writers present their works; he feels it will be an<br />\ninspiration to undergraduate writers<br />\nto see people their own age giving<br />\nreadings. \"I hope that we'll even<br />\nhave some Hopkins grads there.\" He<br />\nwould also like to present different<br />\ntypes of artists at the fair. \"Writing<br />\nSeminars is not just fiction and<br />\npoetry. There will also be film makers<br />\nand journalists there. Students should<br />\nbe aware of the diversity in the field.\"<br />\nA major concern of Arellano's is<br />\nthe \"ever increasing gap betwecn the<br />\nsciences and the humanities. It is a<br />\nproblem for which there is a solu-<br />\n<br />\nThis year, he is establishing minicatagories for fiction and<br />\nplaywriting. The prizes will be<br />\nsmaller, but Arellano feels that \"it is<br />\nthe positive feedback which is important.

I believe it is the duty of the<br />\nuniversities to find it.\" In order to<br />\nwork at finding a solution he will<br />\nteach a course next semester called<br />\n\"Humanistic Evaluation of Science.\"<br />\nArellano also feels that not very<br />\nmany science majors get involved in<br />\n\"artsy\" activities. \"I would really<br />\nlike to see more scientists participate<br />\nin activities sponsored by our department and the other humanities.

The city's unique ethnic<br />\ndiversity practically guarantees a<br />\ndelicious experience in at least one of<br />\nthe numerous restaurants under each<br />\nethnic catagory. If Spanish cuisine is<br />\nyour preference, then Torremolinos<br />\nis just the place for you.<br />\nThe decor is a bit tacky. You'll<br />\nfind yourself staring at walls of<br />\ntapestried bulls and collector plates<br />\nof Don Quixote. But the dim, romantically candlelit Torremolinos<br />\ntranscends this first impression and<br />\ndelivers maximum atmosphere, maximum relaxation, at a moderate price.<br />\nThe first thing you'll want to do is<br />\norder a pitcher of sangria. At $8.50<br />\nfor the pitcher, this mellow, yet<br />\npotent concoction is tar cheaper this<br />\nway than at $1.75 per glass. It's also<br />\nnice to be able to down a glass within<br />\na few minutes and pour yourself<br />\nanother without having to worry .if<br />\nthe waiter is going to think you're a<br />\nlush. Chunky, with ice and pieces of<br />\nfresh fruit, this sangria is the perfect<br />\ncomplement to your dinner.<br />\n<br />\nTorremolino's menu is large and<br />\nselections are printed in both Spanish<br />\nand English. There are a number of<br />\nappetizers, soups and salads to<br />\nchoose from. We tried the shrimp in<br />\ngarlic sauce and snails in the same.<br />\nTen plump shrimp were served hot in<br />\na miniature cast-iron skillet, swimming in a zesty, yet not overpowering<br />\ncream sauce. The snails,* six large<br />\nspecimens, had less sauce and, my<br />\ncompanion complained, not enough<br />\ngarlic. However, they were plump<br />\nand tender and well worth the $4.00.<br />\nThe shrimp were a steal at $3.75. Try<br />\nsomething similar at the Belvedere's<br />\nOwl Bar and you'll find yourself\u2014<br />\nmaybe\u2014 with five tiny shrimp and<br />\nlots of garnish for a steep $5.75.<br />\nWith such a varied menu, including chicken, beef, veal, and<br />\nseafood, it's difficult to choose an entree. However, the Paella Marinara<br />\nproved an excellent choice, the rice<br />\nflavorful and chock full of chunks of<br />\nclam, shrimp and an undetermined<br />\nbut tasty white fish. The paella, rolled over to our table on a cart and<br />\nserved from a large chafing dish by<br />\nour waiter, came surrounded by halv-<br />\n<br />\ned Maine lobster, and numerous baked mussels and clams. Not only was<br />\nit excellently prepared, but artfully<br />\nserved and enormously contenting.<br />\nThe huge portion, $22.75 for two,<br />\nwas enough for us to consider skipping dessert. However, we had had a<br />\nglimpse of the dessert cart and the<br />\ntemptation was too strong to resist.<br />\nDesserts are not plentiful\u2014there<br />\nwere only four choices the Saturday<br />\nnight we were there\u2014but those four<br />\nlooked luscious, at $2.00 each. We<br />\nboth went for the chocolate mousse,<br />\na large serving of a light, yet filling<br />\ncream, topped with shaved chocolate.<br />\nWe both agreed that this was one of<br />\nthe best varieties of this dish we've<br />\nhad yet.<br />\nNearly all of the waiters are<br />\nSpanish, which lends to the authentic atmosphere. In no rush to get you<br />\nout, the service seems a bit slow; the<br />\ntime between ordering and dining<br />\nseems to be longer that it should. But<br />\n<br />\nthis only serves as a means to relax<br />\nand you certainly needn'\u2018 worry<br />\nabout a waiter hanging over your<br />\ntable with the check minutes after<br />\nyou've finished eating. If nothing<br />\nelse, you must ask for the check. In<br />\nour case, dinner came to a little over<br />\n$40, not including the tip.

It comes almost two<br />\nyears after Gaucho, the last complete<br />\nLP by that band, and for those awaiting<br />\nthe next Steely Dan album (due date<br />\nquite uncertain), Fagen's effort is a<br />\nwelcome appetizer: it retains most of the<br />\ntrademarks Dan aficionados have\u2022come<br />\nto expect from Fagen's past collaborations with bassist-partner Walter Becker<br />\nand producer Gary Katz, while succeeding on its own as an intriguing solo<br />\neffort.<br />\nFagen has elected to pursue an admittedly conceptual exercise with The<br />\nNightfly. This is made quite clear by a<br />\nnote on the inner sleeve: \"The songs on<br />\nthis album represent certain fantasies<br />\nthat might have been entertained by a<br />\nyoung man growing up in the remote<br />\nsuburbs of a northeastern city during the<br />\nlate fifties and early sixties; i.e., one of<br />\nmy general height, weight and build.\"<br />\nIt is made clearer still by the cover<br />\n<br />\nphotos: the front cover (in black and<br />\nwhite) features Fagen-as-all-night-D.J.,<br />\nwith an ashtray full of Chesterfields, one<br />\nin his hand, and a Sonny Rollins album<br />\njacket sitting beyond the turntable. The<br />\nclock on the studio wall says it's 4:09.<br />\nThe back cover, suggestively corresponding to the front, portrays an<br />\naluminum-sided suburban tract house in<br />\nthe wee hours, the only glow coming<br />\nfrom a sole upstairs bedroom window.<br />\nIn this, the year of Marshall Crenshaw,<br />\nFagen has released an LP full of songs<br />\nowing much to his naive childhood and<br />\nadolescence. In this, the year of Diner,<br />\nFagen has provided a picture of<br />\nAmerican suburban life spanning the<br />\nyears from Sputnik to the Beatles.<br />\nThe notion of Fagen\u2014who,as half of<br />\nthe creative core of Steely Dan, has with<br />\nconsummate wit and unassailable black<br />\nhumor chronicled the cultural morass of<br />\nthe past fifteen years\u2014looking back at<br />\nthe vapidity of the Cold War in a<br />\nsomewhat sentimental light is truly intriguing. His execution does not disappoint; the bitterness found here is deriv-<br />\n<br />\nSchticks Crowded Into the Barn<br />\n<br />\ned more subtly than on any Steely Dan<br />\nwork. Just when whimsical homages to<br />\nthe great and far-less-than-great jazz of<br />\nthe period and a seeming lyrical softness<br />\nlead the listener to feel that Fagen has<br />\nlittle ire to vent, he lashes out with some<br />\nmasterfully restrained inflection or word<br />\nchoice that brings his audience to the<br />\nrealization that yes, he is laughing, even<br />\nharder than before. After all, the period<br />\nFagen lambasts witnessed the birth of<br />\nthe TV sitcom\u2014what could be more absurd than that cultural incubator, aside<br />\nfrom a culture which has nurtured it in-<br />\n<br />\nto middle age?<br />\nThe Nightfly may waver conceptually, but not much. Certain cuts indicate<br />\nthat Fagen is less than scrupulous about<br />\nmaintaining his narrative identity with<br />\nregard to period or personal attitude;<br />\nthese flaws never really damage, they<br />\njust mar. The LP is (rather expectedly)<br />\na sonic delight: under Katz's direction,<br />\nthe slickness quotient positively festers,<br />\nand Becker's absence on bass, though<br />\ndetectable, isn't readily noticed. The<br />\npredominant effect is rendered by the<br />\ncont. on p. 14<br />\n<br />\nInspector Hound: Stoppard Bottle Yields Theatrical Gatorade<br />\nBY EDWARD B. NAHA<br />\n<br />\nat the Barn, is probably dependent<br />\nalmost entirely on how much entertainHow one likes The Real Inspector ment value one finds in postmodernism<br />\nHound, playing this weekend and next as a framework .for drama. Tom Stoppard's work, as performed by the Barnstormers and directed by Jim Mumford,<br />\nis certainly as well exetuted as any campus production in recent memory, and<br />\nprovides captivating amusement, never<br />\nreally bogging down for its running time<br />\nof a little over an hour. The only element likely to detract from audience enjoyment. is the time-and-space trickery<br />\nconstantly employed by the playwright,<br />\nwhose preoccupations include the<br />\nmockery of various dramatic genres and<br />\nthe ridicule of professional drama<br />\ncritics. It is advisable not to take Stoppard too seriously, for good reasons.<br />\nThe play's setting is an English counPatrick Moctezuma and Kathleen Duke<br />\n<br />\ntry house, or more precis,* a London<br />\ntheater presenting a play which takes<br />\nplace in an English country house. At<br />\nthe opening, we see two rival critics<br />\npreparing to review the evening's show.<br />\nTheir greetings and conversation are<br />\nmasterful give-and-take. The English accents that the cast members were required to bring to auditions are very<br />\nmuch in evidence, and quite adequate.<br />\nThe play, a drawing-room comedy/thriller, begins, and Stoppard starts<br />\nto weave his dramatic web of<br />\nsimultaneous dialogue, violations of<br />\nconventional dramatic barriers, and<br />\ndouble and triple identities. Along the<br />\nway we are treated to a standard-issue<br />\nmystery plot, or at least a fragment<br />\nthereof, unmaskings of two-faced<br />\nCasanovas, and repetition of previous<br />\n<br />\naction. It's all in fun, even though Stoppard's satire wears a tad thin by the<br />\ndenouement (anti-denouement?).<br />\nThe Barnstormers' characterizations<br />\nare all proficient, and some are much<br />\nmore than proficient. Like many of the<br />\nmovies and plays of the genre Stoppard<br />\nstomps on here, the Barnstormers'<br />\nHound is elevated by some fine supporting performances. Hilary Freer is<br />\ntranscendent as the unflappable Mrs.<br />\nDrudge, maid to widow Cynthia Muldoon (Kathleen Duke). Many a scene is<br />\nstolen by the wizened domestic; Freer<br />\ndoes consummate jus.tice to Sir<br />\nGielgud's schtick. Also thoroughly enjoyable is Paul Schultz's portrayal of Inspector Hound.

The recommendation<br />\nwas made the night of the<br />\ndisturbance, during the Council's regularly scheduled<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nThe matter was brought<br />\nbefore the Council by the<br />\nJewish Students Association.<br />\n_ISA President Seth Kaye spoke<br />\nto the Council Wednesday<br /><br />\nCity Re-evaluates Traffic Safety<br />\nBY MITCHELL D SMITH<br />\nCity officials met with<br />\nuniversity, community and student representatives this week<br />\nto formulate an immediate traffic policy following the injury<br />\nof a university employee last<br />\nweek on Charles Street.<br />\nThe immediate plan is to<br />\nplace numerous signs along<br />\nCharles Street to warn both<br />\nmotorists and pedestrians of the<br />\nhazards of the road between<br />\nUniversity Parkway and 29th<br />\nStreet. This action must be approved by the Charles Village<br />\nCivic Association before it is<br />\nimplemented. Radar units will<br />\nalso be installed to help<br />\ndecrease the amount of<br />\nspeeding, especially in the<br />\nsouthbound lanes.<br />\nImpetus for this proposal<br />\ncame from complaints that Student Council Student Life<br />\nCommittee chairman Jon Lana<br />\nmade regarding the city's<br />\noriginal safety plan. Lana said<br />\nthat the city's plan of closing<br />\nthe single southbound lane next<br />\nto the three northbound lanes<br />\nof Charles Street except during<br />\nmorning rush hours and<br />\nstadium events would confuse<br />\npedestrians.<br /><br />\nity pa nts new crosswalk on 33rd Street at Charles Street.<br /><br />\nHowever, Laria admits that<br />\nit would be best to go along<br />\nwith the plan for now, especially since the Student Council approved the plan last year. \"I<br />\ndon't like their plan,\" Lana<br />\nsaid. \"But there is no point in<br />\nturning it into a real battle.\"<br />\nLana says that the city is being<br />\ncooperative, so the students<br />\nshould be cooperative also. \"If<br />\nwe can get [the city's original<br />\nplan] rolling maybe we should<br />\ngo along with it,\" Lana adds.<br />\nHe fears that to delay the<br />\noriginal plan will mean that all<br />\naction would be stopped until<br />\nthe situation could be totally reevaluated.<br /><br />\n.1SA demonstrators protest pro-PLO forum.<br /><br />\nDean of Student Services<br />\nChris Colombo has also expressed his support of the city's<br />\nproposal. He believes that the<br />\nnew signs would have an immediate impact, and as their effect wears thin, the long-term<br />\nplan of closing the lane would<br />\nbe implemented. Colombo does<br />\nnot believe that keeping the lane<br />\nclosed for part of the day will<br />\nbe a problem. \"I don't think<br />\nit's difficult to find out [when<br />\nthere are stadium events],\" he<br />\nsaid. He also stresses that the<br />\nsheer volume of traffic during<br />\nmorning rush hour and stadium<br />\nevents would be obvious to all<br />\npedestrians.<br /><br />\nnight, complaining that .JSA<br />\nmembers had been forcibly<br />\nremoved from the meeting, and<br />\nthat the program was being run<br />\nby<br />\noff-campus groups.<br />\nSpecifically, he said the<br />\nNovember 29th Coalition<br />\n(which co-sponscred the event<br />\nwith the PSU) was \"running<br />\nthe meeting.\"<br />\nThe motion passed by Council \"urged the SAC Executive<br />\nBoard,\" which will meet Monday to deal with the matter,\"to<br />\nrevoke 'the charter of the<br />\nPSU.\" The motion was proposed by Junior Class President<br />\nMike Kun, and passed..almost<br />\nunanimously, with only Dale<br />\nFike abstaining. Contacted<br />\nyesterday, Fike said he abstained because he felt revoking the<br />\nPSU's charter was too harsh.<br />\nIf the SAC Executive Board<br />\nfails to act, the Student Council can revoke the charter itself,<br />\naccording to Harry Davis, who<br />\nis both the treasurer of the<br />\nCouncil and the chairman of<br />\nthe SAC.<br />\n\"I would like to point out,\"<br />\nsaid Davis after the Council's<br />\nmeeting, \"that the Council has<br />\nthe authority to move on this<br />\n[the revocation of the charter]<br />\nunder its constitution. And I<br />\nwill move to do that [revoke the<br />\ncharter] next week, if the SAC<br />\ndoesn't.\"<br />\nYesterday morning Davis<br />\nfroze the PSU's SAC account.<br />\nIt had roughly $170 in it at the<br />\ntime.<br />\n\"This was done in consultation with the Executive Board,\"<br />\nDavis said late yesterday morning. \"It was done to insure that<br />\nthe money did not disappear<br />\nbetween now and Monday's<br />\nmeeting [of the SAC Executive<br />\nBoard].\"<br />\nThe Council first learned of<br />\nthe trouble when, a few minutes<br />\ninto Wednesday night's<br />\nmeeting, several members of<br />\nthe JSA hurried into the<br />\nmeeting. Kaye spoke briefly<br />\nwith both Davis and Student<br />\nCouncil President Doug<br />\nFellman, and then Fellman an-<br /><br />\nnounced that members of the<br />\nJSA had come to the meeting<br />\non an \"emergency priority<br />\nbasis.\" He suggested interruptin, 'he agenda of the meeting,<br />\nand no one objected, allowing<br />\nKaye to speak.<br />\nKaye referred to the PSU<br />\nprogram as one of \"PLO and<br />\nother left-wing speakers,\" and<br />\nstressed that these were \"outside groups that used a PSUsponsored event to come on<br />\ncampus.\"<br />\n\"The JSA wanted to have a<br />\npeaceful candlelight vigil outside,\" said Kaye who was short<br />\nof breath after running to the<br />\nSC meeting from the PSU program. \"Later several of us<br />\n[JSA members' wanted to get<br />\ninside, not to heckle, but to<br />\nobserve and to ask questions<br />\nafterward. We had trouble getting in, but about eight of us<br />\ngot in,\" he continued. Kaye<br />\nsaid that when the JSA<br />\nmembers got up to speak, they<br />\nwere forcibly removed.\"When<br />\nI got up, I was grabbed by two<br />\nnonstudents and forcibly<br />\nremoved,\" he told the Council.<br />\nKaye later told the NewsLetter that he had left the<br />\nauditorium voluntarily after<br />\ntwo other persons were evicted.<br />\nKaye said campus security<br />\nchief Robert Larkin was there<br />\nwith at least four security<br />\nguards, but that they were not<br />\n\"running the program.\"<br />\nThough he did not say exactly<br />\nwho physically removed the<br />\nJSA members, he did say that<br />\nat the time they were removed<br />\nthe program was being \"run by<br />\nmembers of the November 29th<br />\nCoalition.\"<br />\n\"To be violently thrown<br />\nout,\" he told the Council,\"by<br />\noff-campus groups is a travesty of what the University is<br />\nabout....These are people using<br />\nour University, our rooms,<br />\n*which we pay money for, for<br />\ntheir<br />\nfor<br />\nprograms<br />\nnonstudents.\" Kaye claimed<br />\nmost of the crowd at the procont. on p. 3<br /><br />\nPAGE 2/OCTOBER 22:-191f2----<br /><br />\nCunningham, Thomas Discuss Media Curbs<br />\nM %Rh lit AM;<br />\nCal I homas, a spokesman.<br />\nto: he Moral Majority, and<br />\nGeorge C, unnmgham of the<br />\n!iberal group, Americans for<br />\nommun Seitse. debated Monla\\ night over whether the<br />\ngovernment should regulate<br />\ntelevision programming.

Thomas concluded that<br />\nwhat the nation sees on televi\u2014<br />\nsion is dictated by \"a small<br />\nminority of white men in Los<br />\nAngeles.\"<br />\nHe later accused many prominent liberals of using the Big<br />\nLie Theory against the Moral<br />\nMajority. The theory goes that<br />\nif a few people repeat a false<br />\nstatement so large in scope<br />\nenough times, other people will<br /><br />\nbegin to believe it. He denounced Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana for accusing the Moral<br />\nMajority of \"Nazi-like<br />\ntactics.\"<br />\nMr. Thomas concluded his<br />\nspeech by stating his support<br />\nfor a bill currently in the Senate<br />\nwhich would call for minimal<br />\nguidelines to be imposed on<br />\ncable and network television.<br />\nWhen asked what he meant by<br />\n\"minimal guidelines,\" Thomas<br />\nreplied that they would prohibit<br />\nthe use of \"swear words and<br />\nfrontal nudity on television.\"<br />\nGeorge Cunningham, executive director of George<br />\nMcGovern's Americans for<br />\nCommon Sense, began his<br />\npresentation by quoting Dr.<br />\n,Jerry Falwell, the head of the<br />\nMoral Majority, as saying that<br />\ntelevision should portray the<br />\nworld as it should be, not as it<br />\nis. Thomas later denied ever<br />\nhaving heard Dr. Falwell make<br />\nsuch a statement, but claimed<br />\nthat he(Thomas) would have to<br />\nreject it if it were an actual<br />\nquote. Cunningham accused<br />\nthe Coalition for Better Televi-<br /><br />\nThis Is It!

One<br />\nchoice is to have approval of<br />\neverything that is aired or in<br />\nprint, like the government of<br />\nthe Soviet Union. The other<br />\nchoice is to remain neutral, with<br />\nno government rule of the<br />\nmedia. He claimed that there<br />\nwas no way to partially oversee<br />\nthe media. He ended by<br />\n\"casting a vote\" for nonregulation of the media, which the auenthusiastically<br />\ndience<br />\napplauded.<br />\nThe question-and-answer session following the debate yielded little new information or<br />\nviewpoints. Thomas clarified<br />\nhis stand on the cleaning up of<br />\ntelevision programs by drawing<br />\nan analogy between television<br />\nand a water faucet, both being<br />\nitems that the public pays to<br />\nuse. He stated that he would expect the water coming out of<br />\nthe faucet to be drinkable; safe<br />\nenough for his children to<br />\nconsume.<br />\nCunningham replied that<br />\nit looked to him as if Thomas<br />\nhad a. water faucet<br />\nfetish. The audience applauded<br />\nin approval once again. Cunningham went on to say that<br />\ntelevision was an example of<br />\nthe capitalist, American way of<br />\nlife. The same free-enterprise<br /><br />\nsystem that Thomas and the<br />\n-Moral Majority use, although,<br />\nhe said, they wish to deny it to<br />\nothers. He reiterated that the<br />\npeople working on television<br />\nprogramming are responsible to<br />\neconomics. If a show doesn't<br />\nsell products, meaning not<br />\nenough people are watching,<br />\nthen it doesn't stay on the air.<br />\nThe use of boycotts was<br />\nagreed upon by both par,\"-: ats as a perfectly accep.e way for people to show<br />\ntheir opinions. Thomas stated<br />\nthat there was a double standard at work in the American<br />\nmedia. When boycotts are held<br />\nby liberals, the media portray<br />\nthem as heroes fighting unfairness, he claimed, but when<br />\nconservatives exercise their<br />\nrights, the media call them<br />\n\"ayatollahs\" and oppressors of<br />\nfreedom.<br />\nAfter the program was completed, many in the audience<br />\nagreed that Mr. Thomas had<br />\npresented his views more clearly and with less audienceplaying than Mr. Cunningham.<br />\nEllen Wilson, one of the<br />\nchairpersons of the symposium,<br />\nwas very pleased with the audience turnout.<br />\nThe next event is scheduled<br />\nfor Monday night.

Many of the Hopkins<br />\nstudents present felt that the<br />\nlectures consisted largely, of<br />\npro-Palestinian rhetoric.<br />\nEach speaker presented his<br />\nown reasons for supporting the<br />\nPalestinian cause. Mark Lane,<br />\nauthor of Rush to Judgements<br />\nand the most prominent<br />\nspeaker of the evening, denounced Zionism as an \"exclusivist, racist philosophy.\"<br />\nHe compared the state of Israel<br />\nto Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority view of the perfect United<br />\nStates, changing only the<br /><br />\nreligion. Also, he questioned<br />\nwhy the members of the Jewish<br />\nStudent Association who were<br />\nprotesting outside were not in<br />\nIsrael if they felt so strongly the<br />\nneed for a Jewish state.<br />\nOther speakers commented<br />\non the amount of money Israel<br />\nhas received from the United<br />\nStates. Brian Becker, National<br />\nOrganizer for the November<br />\n29th Coalition, blamed the<br />\nUnited States for the<br />\nPalestinian-Israeli problem. He<br />\nsaid that the United States,<br />\nunder the direction of leaders.<br />\nlike Ronald Reagan and<br />\nRichard Nixon, was supporting<br />\nIsrael not for the Zionist cause<br />\nbut rather for financial gain.<br />\nAdditional speakers included<br />\nMankekola Ngcobo, a representative of the African National<br />\nCongress.

Circulation 7000.<br /><br />\nGrads Must Take Undergrads Seriously<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nThe October 15 reply by four<br />\ngraduate students to the NewsLetter article entitled \"T.A.'s<br />\nShould Speak English\" reflects<br />\npart of the problem between<br />\nundergraduates and teaching<br />\nassistants. Rather than consider<br />\nthe proposals of the article, and<br />\naccept or reject them on tht<br />\nbasis of their feasibility, HueyMiin Lee, Sitki Irk, Kenneth<br />\nChan and Ricardo SalvattiMann chose to highlight its<br />\ngrammatical errors. Graduate<br />\nstudent concerns about T.A.<br />\nwitchhunts are valid, but making light of undergraduate concerns merely complicates the<br />\nproblem.<br />\nThe Education Committee of<br />\nthe Student Council has been<br />\nSincerely,<br />\ndeliberating over this issue<br />\nDavid Plaut<br />\n(English proficiency) for some<br />\nEducation Committee<br />\ntime. The problem is largely out Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nof its hands in that foreign<br />\nStudies<br /><br />\nTerrorists, Murderers, Mobs<br />\nAnd The First Amendment<br />\nHopkins students, never noted for their<br />\nactivism or confrontational tactics, created<br />\ncontroversy Wednesday night as the Jewish<br />\nStudents Association and the Progressive<br />\nStudent Union clashed over the PSU's proPalestinian \"teach-in\" discussion. Except<br />\nfor several minor incidents, the program was<br />\npeaceful. However, the highly charged tensions and emotions that ipermeated the<br />\nevent's atmosphere produced the potential<br />\nfor violence. The problems associated with<br />\nthe event raised several important questions:<br />\nshould these controversial speakers have<br />\nbeen invited to speak at Hopkins; should the<br />\nJSA have protested in the manner in which<br />\nthey did; should security have been handled differently, and how should the Student<br />\nCouncil and<br />\nAdministration<br />\nrespond to the event?<br />\nOriginally, some JSA members objected<br />\nto the fact that speakers who were affiliated<br />\nwith the Palestine Liberation Organization<br />\nwere given the opportunity to speak at<br />\nHopkins. They argued that the PLO is a terrorist organization and inviting them to<br />\nspeak at Hopkins would be tantamount to<br />\ncondoning their actions. However, to prohibit advocates of a certain politcial position<br />\nfrom publicly expressing their views is a<br />\nviolation of their right to free speech, no<br />\nmatter how repulsive their views might be<br />\nto some people. Students, especially, should<br />\nbe exposed to as many sides of an issue as<br />\npossible, so that they can make an enlightened<br />\ndecision.)t would have been commendable<br />\nif the PSU had chosen to present speakers<br />\nrepresenting both sides of the issue, however<br />\nthey were not obligated to do so.<br />\nJust as the PSU has the right to invite any<br />\nspeaker they wish, the JSA has the right to<br />\nconduct a peacable protest and to ask critical<br />\nquestions of the speakers. The candlelight<br />\nvigil and the distribution of literature outside Levering Hall prior to the PSU program<br />\nwas conducted very responsibly. However,<br />\nthe JSA does not have the right to disrupt<br />\nthe program, for this is a violation of the<br />\nspeaker's rights. Sometimes there is a fine<br />\nline between protesting and disruption. The<br />\nJSA approached this line as they attempted<br />\nto enter the L/V room equipped with banners, a flag and a megaphone. PSU members<br />\nhad to bar the doors so as to prohibit anyone<br />\nfrom entering who had the intention of<br />\nheckling or disrupting the program. Some<br />\nbrief skirmishes erupted in the foyer outside<br />\nthe L/V room as JSA members came into<br />\ncontact with people entering the auditorium.<br />\nThe potential for violent confrontation<br />\nwould have been severely reduced if the JSA<br />\nhad limited its demonstration to the area outside the front entrance of Levering Hall<br />\nwhere they had originally assembled. In<br />\nretrospect it would have been better if the<br />\nJSA had shown more restraint in their protest of the event.<br />\nThe primary problem of the evening<br />\nhowever was security. In order to constrain<br />\nhecklers and disrupters the PSU used a<br />\nsecurity force, partially composed of<br />\nmembers of the November 29th Coalition.<br />\nThe security guards acquired by the PSU<br />\nwere terrible. They were much too eager to<br />\nresort to physical violence to put down minor<br /><br />\ndisturbances. Physical force was clearly unwarranted in all cases. The blame for the<br />\nsecurity problems must be shared by the<br />\nPSU, University Security, and the present<br />\nprocedures for arranging security for campus events.<br />\nThe onus of providing adequate security<br />\nfor campus activities falls on the student<br />\ngroup that sponsors the event. Due to lack<br />\nof funds, the PSU could not afford to hire<br />\nUniversity Security to police the function and<br />\ninstead relied on members of the November<br />\n29th Coalition. This was a poor choice on<br />\nthe PSU's part, yet there is something wrong<br />\nwith a system that allows an irresponsible<br />\nsecurity force to police such a controversial<br />\nevent. In a case where the sponsoring group<br />\ncannot afford to hire a professional security guards, either the Student Council,<br />\nthrough the speakers fund, or the Ad- .<br />\nministration should foot the bill. Although<br />\nUniversity Security attended the event, they<br />\nchose not to take an active role inside the'<br />\niuditorium until the question and answer<br />\nwriod. While it is true that they were not<br />\nrequired to do so, their presence would havel<br />\nundoubtedly deterred disruption on both the<br />\npart of hecklers and the security force. All<br />\ngroups involved in the event, therefore, contributed to the uneasy situation.<br />\nIn response to the controversy that this<br />\nevent sparked, the Student Council recommended that the SAC decharter the Progressive Student Union thereby denying them<br />\nSAC status. This decision, however, was based on the Council's perceptions of Wednesday night's events. Their information was<br />\nprovided solely by JSA president Seth Kaye,<br />\nand some of his facts were erroneous. Kaye<br />\ntold the Council that when JSA members<br />\ntried to speak, they were forcibly removed.<br />\nThere were only two instances in which questioners were removed; the questioners were<br />\nnot recognized to speak, and were thus<br />\ndisrupting the program. Kaye told the Council that some students were not allowed into the program; no student who attempted<br />\nto peacefully and civilly gain entrance was<br />\nturned away until Hopkins security closed<br />\nthe doors. The PSU, despite security problems, did the best they could to prevent<br />\nviolence from occurring at the meeting.<br />\nThe Council's action was made hastily;<br />\nthey had made a decision before the PSU<br />\nprogram was completed. It was based on<br />\nhalf-truths; some of their information wasincorrect, and they never consulted the PSU.<br />\nThe decision was a bad one.<br />\nOnce the facts have been re-examined, it<br />\nwill be clear that the case to decharter the<br />\nPSU is weak. Certainly the PSU made some<br />\nerrors, but no student group has ever<br />\noperated without making some mistakes.<br />\nSince both the Student Council and the SAC<br />\nExecutive Board have shown themselves to<br />\nbe rational, deliberative bodies, it is unlikely that either would vote to decharter the<br />\nPSU.<br />\nWednesday night was a bad night for clear<br />\nthinking. Everyone made errors in judgment.<br />\nNo one was without fault, and no one was<br />\ntotally to blame. Hopefully all involved will<br />\nlearn from their mistakes and they will not<br />\nrecur.

Hopkins succeeded in<br />\nsaving the institution from the<br />\nmoral decay of \"hardcore\"pornographic cinematography,<br />\nand thereby set a precedent for<br />\nthe future of pornography and<br />\neroticism on campus. Last<br />\nyear's showing of Debbie Does<br />\nDallas, an example of porn at<br />\nwhat could possibly be called its<br />\nmost boring, may have been the<br />\nlast time the dregs of the Block<br />\nattempted to move uptown.<br />\nPornography has died on the<br />\nthreshold of The Johns<br />\nHopkins University and all the<br />\nschool's good little students are<br />\nsafe. Or are they?<br />\nIn the deliberations on<br />\nwhether or not to show Deep<br />\nThroat, the possibility was raised that some members of the<br />\nHopkins community might be<br />\noffended, particularly the<br />\nwomen. If certain people would<br />\nhave been offended by such a<br />\nshowing, they could have simply banned the film, although I<br />\ndo resent that women were<br />\nsingled out as the collective<br />\npurveyors of pornographic<br />\nrepression. No one would have<br />\nbeen forcing anyone to see it,<br />\nwhereas by not showing the<br />\nfilm, you are \"forcing\" those<br />\nwho want to see it not to.<br />\nWhat worries me most about<br />\nthis is that the people who cannot see pornography on campus<br />\nwill go find it somewhere else,<br />\nwhere thay are exposed to more<br />\nthan just a dirty picture. While<br />\nHopkins may be attempting to<br />\n\"protect\" its students, it may<br />\nonly be inducing them to jump<br />\ninto the proverbial fire of the<br />\nBlock. In particular, Hopkins<br />\nwould be one of the few acceptable places for women to view<br />\nporn. Admittedly, not every<br />\nwoman enjoys it, but I would<br />\nguess that many are curious<br />\nabout it. A woman could go<br />\nalone to a pornographic film<br />\nshown at Hopkins and feel<br />\nsafe; how many women do you<br />\nknow who would hazard a trip<br />\ndowntown\u2014even in a group\u2014<br />\nto see a porno flick on East<br />\nBaltimore Street? Hopkins<br />\ncould provide a safe environment to satisfy this basic<br />\ncuriosity.<br /><br />\nnography,\" \"Eroticism is for bored with the repetitious ac[love]; pornography is against tion of porn. Eroticism can be<br />\nit.\" Never would I suggest that real, intent upon serving up a<br />\na movie such as Beat the Bitch portion of sexually (although<br />\nbe shown on campus, a horri- not always)explicit art that can<br />\nfying clip of which was shown wrap the viewer around its<br />\nin the documentary-like Cana- story as well as any \"straight\"<br />\ndian film.

My major<br />\ncontribution was in an earlier<br />\nbook, a more technical book,<br />\nwritten in 1979. The 1981 book,<br />\nThe New<br />\nEvolutionary<br />\nTimetable, was actually a statement of the controversy as I<br />\nhave seen it. It was a review of<br />\nsome of the arguments. An incomplete<br />\nreview,<br />\nbut<br />\nnonetheless a review of some of<br />\nthe arguments I had set forth.<br />\nI did include some new ideas,<br />\nwhich related to implications of<br />\nthe model. I said more about<br />\nhuman evolution, how I think<br />\nit (puntuational equilibrium)<br />\napplied to that. I talked about<br />\nsome of the historical aspects of<br />\nthe controversy. I tried to<br />\nanalyze the reasons people<br />\navoided a puntuational view for<br />\nmany decades.

It<br />\nhas been overstated even by<br />\nscientists, who seem somehow<br />\nto misinterpret what people are<br />\nsaying. There's nothing in the<br />\npunctuational view that says<br />\nnatural selection may not be<br />\nproducing all evolutionary<br />\nchange that is displayed in the<br />\nfossil record. The punctuational view says that most<br />\nevolutionary change is concentrated in brief episodes of rapid<br />\nchange of populations. That<br />\nmay be primarily the result of<br />\nnatural selection, and probably<br />\nis. There may be other mechanisms involved as well. But<br />\nthere's nothing in the punctuational view that requires<br />\nanything but natural selection.<br />\nWe're really talking about a<br />\npattern. Details of what's happening in these small populations still remain to be worked<br />\nout. Undoubtedly, natural<br />\nselection plays a major role;<br />\nwhether it's overwhelmingly<br />\nimportant is not certain.<br />\nN-L: Between \"events,\"<br />\ngradual evolution is still<br />\npossible.<br />\nStanley: Some gradual evolution still goes on because<br />\nnothing remains perfectly still<br />\nin nature. The question is how<br />\nmuch goes on and how important it is. The traditional view<br />\nhas been that species of the sort<br />\nthat occur all around us are<br />\nconstantly changing in significant ways. They are undergoing<br />\nchange in significant ways.<br />\nThey are undergoing change in<br />\nresponse to environmental<br />\nchange. These changes are<br />\nthought of as changes that are<br />\ncontinuously adapting them to<br />\nthe environment as it changes.<br />\nUndoubtedly some changes do<br />\noccur. These are changes going<br />\non in the species. But my view,<br />\nfrom looking at the fossil<br />\nrecord is that such changes are<br />\nvery, very slight. They don't<br />\nmeet environmental changes.<br />\nSpecies are lasting, once wellestablished, for one hundred<br />\nthousand, one million, or ten<br />\nmillion generations, without<br />\nchanging enough that we would<br />\ncall them by new species names.<br />\nThere must be a little bit of fine<br />\ntuning going on, but it's not as<br />\nsignificant as people have<br />\nbelieved. Most species that are<br />\nwell-established aren't constantly being remodeled such<br />\nthat within a .few thousand or<br />\na few tens of thousands of<br />\ngenerations they are totally<br />\ntransformed.<br />\nN-L: Has there ever been a case<br />\npresented where one species,<br />\nwithout the help of one large<br />\nmutation, gradually changed<br />\ninto another species? There is<br />\nno gap. At the \"beginning\" it<br />\nis recognized as one species and<br />\nat the \"end\" it is recognized as<br />\nanother.<br />\nStanley: There are some possible examples, but before continuing let me correct a misapprehension. The punctuational<br /><br />\nview does not rely on single<br />\nmutations, necessarily. Transformations may involve several<br />\nmutations. Maybe one or two<br />\nare particularly important,<br />\nwhile others are of secondary<br />\nimportance. As far as the more<br />\ngeneral question, of the<br />\ntransformation of an entire<br />\nspecies, there are a few examples on record of instances<br />\nthat look as if they might represent such change. Whether<br />\nthey're valid is in some cases<br />\ndebatable, and in other cases<br />\nthey look to be fairly solid. If<br />\nit requires several million years<br />\nfor such a transformation to<br />\ntake place it's very slow evolution with regard to the more<br />\ndramatic evolutionary events in<br />\nthe history of life. The total<br />\namount of change contributed<br />\nby these transformations is<br />\nmodest. It's much less than half<br />\nof the total change.<br />\nN-L: How,in your view, would<br />\nan order or a larger unit of<br />\nclassification arise\u2014even a<br />\nphylum? I can think of some<br />\nexamples where, unless you do<br />\nas Darwin did and blame the<br />\nfossil record, there are large<br />\nanatomical gaps. For instance,<br />\nCrossopterygians and Ichthyostega (Ichthyostega is the earliest<br />\nknown amphibian, Crossoptery<br />\ngian an advanced fish recognized as being Ichthyostega's<br />\nclosest known related ancestor).<br />\nThere's very little time to make<br />\nsuch a large jump.<br />\nStanley: There's a complete<br />\nspectrum of possibilites. Is<br />\nthere just one or a small<br />\nnumber of large steps giving<br />\nrise to another class, order or<br />\nphylum? Or, are there lots of<br />\nsmall steps? It's not entirely<br />\nclear. My view is that it's difficult to invoke a large number<br />\nof small steps in many cases.<br />\nUltimately, there are two problems. One is, why species,<br />\nonce they're well-established,<br />\nare stable and tend not to<br />\nevolve very rapidly?. The other<br />\nside of the coin is how do these<br />\nrapid changes occur in small<br />\npopulations? Until we recog<br />\nnize what goes on, the question<br />\nyou're asking is not fully<br />\nanswered. It may be the result<br />\nof very intense natural selection<br />\nopeating on very small populations. My personal feeling is<br />\nwhat happens is, you have to<br />\nremove the population from the<br />\nnormal environment in which it<br />\nlives. Then it's most likely to<br />\nget these sorts of transformations in populations that, for<br />\none reason or another, are in<br />\nunusual environmental settings.<br />\nThis may not be physical environment I'm talking about,<br />\nbut biological environment. It<br />\nappears to me that one of the<br />\nobstacles to a major transformation in a large species is<br />\nsimply thete are lots of interactions among genes. Imagine<br />\nthat you have a particular<br />\ngenetic change that might have<br />\nimportant effects on adaptation.

I'm pretty sure that she was<br />\nimpressed by it (she even yelled out,<br />\n\"Why don't you cut the crap?\") until one of the pencils punctured her<br />\nleft eardrum. Then, like a baby, she<br />\nstarted whining until a teacher showed up, and I ended up getting two<br />\nweeks of detention.<br />\n11.

Some girl who was in Baker last<br />\nyear (I think she said her name was<br />\nSharon, but I don't remember)<br />\nOne night, my friends and I were<br />\npretty bored, so we decided to fool<br />\naround and call up the dorms. Well,<br />\nthis girl answered the phone and I<br />\ntold her that I was a member of<br />\nAlpha Kappa Nu fraternity(\"The Nu<br />\nfrat on campus!\"). Then I invited her<br />\nto our upcoming party, Knockwurst<br />\nNight(\"Bring your own condiments!\"). Then one of my friends<br />\ngrabbed the phone and told her who<br />\nI was and that I had made the whole<br />\nthing up. I was very embarrassed.<br /><br />\n13. Tracy Pestler<br />\nTim Pestler, Tracy's brother, was<br />\none of my good friends in high school<br />\n(he became my very best friend in the<br />\nwhole world when I found out that<br />\nTracy was his sister), so I used to<br />\nhang out at her house a lot. Anyhow,<br />\nonce she and her mom came back<br />\nearlier than they were supposed to<br />\nfrom shopping, and Tracy caught me<br />\ntrying on her beige jumpsuit in her<br />\nbedroom.

In July, however, he officially<br />\ntransferred to a full-time position<br />\nwith the Writing Seminars Department.

He began the Introduction<br />\nto Playwriting class in 1970, and since<br />\nthen has been working in both the<br />\nChemistry and Writing Seminars<br />\ndepartments. However, \"It was really difficult to keep up with both, the<br />\nwork load got to be too heavy.\" So<br />\nArellano chose between the two. It<br />\ntook two years for him to make the<br />\ntransition to the Writing Seminars<br />\nDepartment because the Chemistry<br />\nDepartment had trouble finding a<br />\nreplacement for him.<br />\nArellano's present position is that<br />\nof Director of Undergraduate Studies<br />\nin the Writing Seminars Department.<br />\nIn addition, he supervises the film<br />\ncourses and all sections of Contemporary American Letters. It was<br />\nArellano who established the practice<br />\nof having M.A. candidates come to<br />\nHopkins a week early in the fall for<br />\na workshop in teaching. \"I felt that<br />\nit was important for them to get a feel<br />\nfor teaching before they started out<br />\nas TAs\" he said.<br />\nOne of Arellano's foremost<br />\nresponsibilities is to head the advising program for Writing Seminars<br />\nmajors. He is the faculty advisor for<br /><br />\nall 49 undergraduates. \"I think [advising] is one of my most important<br />\njobs.

The city's unique ethnic<br />\ndiversity practically guarantees a<br />\ndelicious experience in at least one of<br />\nthe numerous restaurants under each<br />\nethnic catagory. If Spanish cuisine is<br />\nyour preference, then Torremolinos<br />\nis just the place for you.<br />\nThe decor is a bit tacky. You'll<br />\nfind yourself staring at walls of<br />\ntapestried bulls and collector plates<br />\nof Don Quixote. But the dim, romantically candlelit Torremolinos<br />\ntranscends this first impression and<br />\ndelivers maximum atmosphere, maximum relaxation, at a moderate price.<br />\nThe first thing you'll want to do is<br />\norder a pitcher of sangria. At $8.50<br />\nfor the pitcher, this mellow, yet<br />\npotent concoction is tar cheaper this<br />\nway than at $1.75 per glass. It's also<br />\nnice to be able to down a glass within<br />\na few minutes and pour yourself<br />\nanother without having to worry .if<br />\nthe waiter is going to think you're a<br />\nlush. Chunky, with ice and pieces of<br />\nfresh fruit, this sangria is the perfect<br />\ncomplement to your dinner.<br /><br />\nTorremolino's menu is large and<br />\nselections are printed in both Spanish<br />\nand English. There are a number of<br />\nappetizers, soups and salads to<br />\nchoose from. We tried the shrimp in<br />\ngarlic sauce and snails in the same.<br />\nTen plump shrimp were served hot in<br />\na miniature cast-iron skillet, swimming in a zesty, yet not overpowering<br />\ncream sauce. The snails,* six large<br />\nspecimens, had less sauce and, my<br />\ncompanion complained, not enough<br />\ngarlic. However, they were plump<br />\nand tender and well worth the $4.00.<br />\nThe shrimp were a steal at $3.75. Try<br />\nsomething similar at the Belvedere's<br />\nOwl Bar and you'll find yourself\u2014<br />\nmaybe\u2014 with five tiny shrimp and<br />\nlots of garnish for a steep $5.75.<br />\nWith such a varied menu, including chicken, beef, veal, and<br />\nseafood, it's difficult to choose an entree. However, the Paella Marinara<br />\nproved an excellent choice, the rice<br />\nflavorful and chock full of chunks of<br />\nclam, shrimp and an undetermined<br />\nbut tasty white fish. The paella, rolled over to our table on a cart and<br />\nserved from a large chafing dish by<br />\nour waiter, came surrounded by halv-<br /><br />\ned Maine lobster, and numerous baked mussels and clams. Not only was<br />\nit excellently prepared, but artfully<br />\nserved and enormously contenting.<br />\nThe huge portion, $22.75 for two,<br />\nwas enough for us to consider skipping dessert. However, we had had a<br />\nglimpse of the dessert cart and the<br />\ntemptation was too strong to resist.<br />\nDesserts are not plentiful\u2014there<br />\nwere only four choices the Saturday<br />\nnight we were there\u2014but those four<br />\nlooked luscious, at $2.00 each. We<br />\nboth went for the chocolate mousse,<br />\na large serving of a light, yet filling<br />\ncream, topped with shaved chocolate.<br />\nWe both agreed that this was one of<br />\nthe best varieties of this dish we've<br />\nhad yet.<br />\nNearly all of the waiters are<br />\nSpanish, which lends to the authentic atmosphere. In no rush to get you<br />\nout, the service seems a bit slow; the<br />\ntime between ordering and dining<br />\nseems to be longer that it should. But<br /><br />\nthis only serves as a means to relax<br />\nand you certainly needn'\u2018 worry<br />\nabout a waiter hanging over your<br />\ntable with the check minutes after<br />\nyou've finished eating. If nothing<br />\nelse, you must ask for the check. In<br />\nour case, dinner came to a little over<br />\n$40, not including the tip.

It comes almost two<br />\nyears after Gaucho, the last complete<br />\nLP by that band, and for those awaiting<br />\nthe next Steely Dan album (due date<br />\nquite uncertain), Fagen's effort is a<br />\nwelcome appetizer: it retains most of the<br />\ntrademarks Dan aficionados have\u2022come<br />\nto expect from Fagen's past collaborations with bassist-partner Walter Becker<br />\nand producer Gary Katz, while succeeding on its own as an intriguing solo<br />\neffort.<br />\nFagen has elected to pursue an admittedly conceptual exercise with The<br />\nNightfly. This is made quite clear by a<br />\nnote on the inner sleeve: \"The songs on<br />\nthis album represent certain fantasies<br />\nthat might have been entertained by a<br />\nyoung man growing up in the remote<br />\nsuburbs of a northeastern city during the<br />\nlate fifties and early sixties; i.e., one of<br />\nmy general height, weight and build.\"<br />\nIt is made clearer still by the cover<br /><br />\nphotos: the front cover (in black and<br />\nwhite) features Fagen-as-all-night-D.J.,<br />\nwith an ashtray full of Chesterfields, one<br />\nin his hand, and a Sonny Rollins album<br />\njacket sitting beyond the turntable. The<br />\nclock on the studio wall says it's 4:09.<br />\nThe back cover, suggestively corresponding to the front, portrays an<br />\naluminum-sided suburban tract house in<br />\nthe wee hours, the only glow coming<br />\nfrom a sole upstairs bedroom window.<br />\nIn this, the year of Marshall Crenshaw,<br />\nFagen has released an LP full of songs<br />\nowing much to his naive childhood and<br />\nadolescence.

Just when whimsical homages to<br />\nthe great and far-less-than-great jazz of<br />\nthe period and a seeming lyrical softness<br />\nlead the listener to feel that Fagen has<br />\nlittle ire to vent, he lashes out with some<br />\nmasterfully restrained inflection or word<br />\nchoice that brings his audience to the<br />\nrealization that yes, he is laughing, even<br />\nharder than before. After all, the period<br />\nFagen lambasts witnessed the birth of<br />\nthe TV sitcom\u2014what could be more absurd than that cultural incubator, aside<br />\nfrom a culture which has nurtured it in-<br /><br />\nto middle age?<br />\nThe Nightfly may waver conceptually, but not much. Certain cuts indicate<br />\nthat Fagen is less than scrupulous about<br />\nmaintaining his narrative identity with<br />\nregard to period or personal attitude;<br />\nthese flaws never really damage, they<br />\njust mar. The LP is (rather expectedly)<br />\na sonic delight: under Katz's direction,<br />\nthe slickness quotient positively festers,<br />\nand Becker's absence on bass, though<br />\ndetectable, isn't readily noticed.

NAHA<br /><br />\nat the Barn, is probably dependent<br />\nalmost entirely on how much entertainHow one likes The Real Inspector ment value one finds in postmodernism<br />\nHound, playing this weekend and next as a framework .for drama. Tom Stoppard's work, as performed by the Barnstormers and directed by Jim Mumford,<br />\nis certainly as well exetuted as any campus production in recent memory, and<br />\nprovides captivating amusement, never<br />\nreally bogging down for its running time<br />\nof a little over an hour. The only element likely to detract from audience enjoyment. is the time-and-space trickery<br />\nconstantly employed by the playwright,<br />\nwhose preoccupations include the<br />\nmockery of various dramatic genres and<br />\nthe ridicule of professional drama<br />\ncritics. It is advisable not to take Stoppard too seriously, for good reasons.<br />\nThe play's setting is an English counPatrick Moctezuma and Kathleen Duke<br /><br />\ntry house, or more precis,* a London<br />\ntheater presenting a play which takes<br />\nplace in an English country house. At<br />\nthe opening, we see two rival critics<br />\npreparing to review the evening's show.<br />\nTheir greetings and conversation are<br />\nmasterful give-and-take. The English accents that the cast members were required to bring to auditions are very<br />\nmuch in evidence, and quite adequate.<br />\nThe play, a drawing-room comedy/thriller, begins, and Stoppard starts<br />\nto weave his dramatic web of<br />\nsimultaneous dialogue, violations of<br />\nconventional dramatic barriers, and<br />\ndouble and triple identities. Along the<br />\nway we are treated to a standard-issue<br />\nmystery plot, or at least a fragment<br />\nthereof, unmaskings of two-faced<br />\nCasanovas, and repetition of previous<br /><br />\naction. It's all in fun, even though Stoppard's satire wears a tad thin by the<br />\ndenouement (anti-denouement?).<br />\nThe Barnstormers' characterizations<br />\nare all proficient, and some are much<br />\nmore than proficient. Like many of the<br />\nmovies and plays of the genre Stoppard<br />\nstomps on here, the Barnstormers'<br />\nHound is elevated by some fine supporting performances. Hilary Freer is<br />\ntranscendent as the unflappable Mrs.<br />\nDrudge, maid to widow Cynthia Muldoon (Kathleen Duke). Many a scene is<br />\nstolen by the wizened domestic; Freer<br />\ndoes consummate jus.tice to Sir<br />\nGielgud's schtick. Also thoroughly enjoyable is Paul Schultz's portrayal of Inspector Hound.
