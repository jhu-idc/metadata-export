Due to the bad weather, only a small crowd was on<br />\nhand, but those who braved the<br />\nrain were treated to a fine game<br />\nof lacrosse. Pennsylvania put out<br />\na much stronger team than usual.<br />\nTheir stickwork was good; they<br />\nwere fast and aggressive, and had<br />\nlots of fight. The lead of seven<br />\ngoals does not, however, by any<br />\nMeans show the comparative<br />\nstrength of the two teams. The<br />\nwet, muddy field put both teams \u2022<br />\non an equality, making the running hard, dodging almost impossible and the bouncing of the ball<br />\nerratic. The stickwork was below<br />\nstandard at times also, due to the<br />\nwet ball slipping out of the stick.<br />\nHad the field been a dry one the<br />\nscore would without doubt have<br />\nbeen greater. Throughout the<br />\ngame Hopkins showed a strong attack, good teamwork and the ability to shoot hard and accurately<br />\nafter the ball had been worked<br />\nThe point that<br />\ndOWn the field.<br />\nwas especially noticeable was how<br />\nwell the midfield worked in with<br />\nthe close attack, and with several<br />\nweeks more practice it looks as if<br />\nthe coaches will have developed<br />\nout of green material an attack<br />\nthat will equal Hopkins' best.<br />\nThe defense also played a strong<br />\ngame, although its part was not<br />\nas heavy Saturday as that of the<br />\nattack.

Prengle scored for Penn at<br />\nthis time on a pass from Kiviat<br />\nover goal. Bauernschinidt, who<br />\nsubstituted for McDaniel, made<br />\nthe last score of the half by picking up the ball off the ground and<br />\nmaking a pretty corner shot.<br />\nPenn came back strong in the<br />\nsecond half, and except for one<br />\ngoal by Boyd held Hopkins score(Continued on page 4 col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nr -Arra<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., APRIL 26, 1921<br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS SCORE HIT<br />\nIN CHURCH CONCERT.<br />\nFranklin Square Baptists Applaud Selections\u2014All Performers in Fine<br />\nForm\u2014University Ode Well<br />\nReceived.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins combined<br />\nsi cal clubs presented an unusually -snappy\" and successful concert at the Franklin Square Baptist Church on Thursday evening,<br />\nApril 21.

A<br />\nsecond solo took place later in the<br />\nevening when Waldo Hambleton<br />\nplayed \"The Rosary\" on his steel<br />\nguitar.

After the usual preliminary business and an address iy<br />\nMr. John Stewart Bryan, secretary American Newspaper Publishers' Association, the conference adjourned for luncheon, and<br />\nin the afternoon took a tour of inspection through the plant of the<br />\nRichmond Erening Dispatch. At<br />\nthe banquet held that night the attention of the delegates was held<br />\nby the remarkable addresses of<br />\nDr. John W.

The lead of seven<br />\ngoals does not, however, by any<br />\nMeans show the comparative<br />\nstrength of the two teams. The<br />\nwet, muddy field put both teams \u2022<br />\non an equality, making the running hard, dodging almost impossible and the bouncing of the ball<br />\nerratic. The stickwork was below<br />\nstandard at times also, due to the<br />\nwet ball slipping out of the stick.<br />\nHad the field been a dry one the<br />\nscore would without doubt have<br />\nbeen greater. Throughout the<br />\ngame Hopkins showed a strong attack, good teamwork and the ability to shoot hard and accurately<br />\nafter the ball had been worked<br />\nThe point that<br />\ndOWn the field.<br />\nwas especially noticeable was how<br />\nwell the midfield worked in with<br />\nthe close attack, and with several<br />\nweeks more practice it looks as if<br />\nthe coaches will have developed<br />\nout of green material an attack<br />\nthat will equal Hopkins' best.<br />\nThe defense also played a strong<br />\ngame, although its part was not<br />\nas heavy Saturday as that of the<br />\nattack.

The coni'mittee has as chairman, Prof. J.<br />\nHerbert Gregory, as vice-chairman,<br />\nDr. William B. Kouwenhoven, and<br />\nas secretary, Dr. Ronald T. Abercrombie. The members of the committee are at present making themselves familiar with the technical<br />\ndetails of the work of the military<br />\ndepartment. The committee is designed to form a connecting link<br />\nbetween the military department<br />\nand the board of collegiate studies.<br />\nIt has been constituted, moreover,<br />\nwith the idea of being a University<br />\ncheck on the activities of the military department, and it is believed<br />\nthat it will form, in the future, a<br />\nmost useful and constructive body<br />\nin fitting the military activities in<br />\nwith University traditions and<br />\npolicy. The idea of such a committee was originated some months<br />\nago bv Major Garey, and its establishment marks the recognition on<br />\nthe part of the faculty of the important place the military department has won for itself among similar institutions throughout the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nThe percentage of Johns Hopkins men attending R. 0. T. C.<br />\nslimmer camp this year is greater,<br />\nit is believed, than that of any<br />\nother institution in the country.<br />\nMajor Garey, senior instructor at<br />\nthe Plattsburg Camp, intends to<br />\ngrade both individuals and institutions at the camp on their efficiency and ability. A special class<br />\nhas been formed here for study<br />\npreparatory to the subsequent<br />\nwork at camp, with the purpose of<br />\nputting . this institution number<br />\none at Plattsburg.<br />\nThe finishing touches for this<br />\nyear's inspection for rating as a<br />\n\"distinguished\" unit are being put<br />\nupon the drill of the battalion.<br />\nThe inspectors this year will be<br />\nfrom the Third Corps Area, instead of from the General Staff at<br />\nWashington, as formerly. Our<br />\ncommandant appeals to the members of the R. 0. T. C. to put their<br />\nevery effort into the military work<br />\nuntil the end of the year, in order<br />\nthat we primarily may serve well<br />\nthe interests of national defense,<br />\nand secondarily may come out<br />\nwith an exceedingly high average<br />\nin comparison with other Units.<br />\nMajor Garey also expressed himself as wishing the sympathy and<br />\nmoral backing of the entire University in the accomplishment of<br />\nthese objects.<br /><br />\nThe wine, women and song number of the Black and Blue Jay<br />\n\"casts a thunderbolt into the generally dignified campus at Homewood,\" according to the Baltimore<br />\n8un. It compliments the staff on<br />\nproducing a \"snappy\" number and<br />\nquotes a few articles which were<br />\nconsidered to produce the \"pep.\"<br />\nNor is this all. The general concensus of opinion seems to accept<br />\nthis issue as the best of the year.<br />\nThe Grad's number, however, in<br />\nwhich the Jay makes its final flutter of the term, promises to exceed<br />\n,its predecessor in \"snappiness\" if<br />\nit receives the support of the university.<br />\nThe magazine is essentially a<br />\nrepresentative of the student-body<br />\nand as such deserves unlimited<br />\naid by way of contributions.<br />\nA song book is being planned by<br />\nthe Jay and will probably make<br />\nits debut sometime next year. This<br />\ndoes not mark a divergence from<br />\nthe ordinary line of university publications, for they are used by<br />\nnearly all the leading colleges.<br />\nThis book will include all of the<br />\nold traditional songs of Hopkins,<br />\nas well as a great number of new<br />\nones. The faculty and the 0. D.
