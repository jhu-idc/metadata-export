What possessed him<br />\nto come here? What possessed<br />\nthe department to bring him<br />\nhere? Specifically, how are<br />\njumor faculty members recruited at Hopkins?<br />\nThe process begins when a<br />\ndepartment decides it needs a<br />\nnew faculty member in a particular subject area. For instance, the history department<br />\ndiscovers that it is short on professors or that it has just lost a<br />\nleading expert in Russian history to retirement.<br />\nThe department chair talks<br />\nwith the Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences about a new or reolacement position in Russian<br />\n\u2022 history, and they agree that if<br />\na suitable candidate can be<br />\nfound for a junior faculty position, the dean will make sure<br />\nmoney is provided. If the dean<br />\nfinds the School ot Nrts and<br />\nSciences is in difficult economic<br />\nstraits, he may veto any proposed department expansion.<br />\nThe department chairman<br />\nthen proceeds to advertise in<br />\nt hose publications most likely<br />\nto be read by Russian history<br />\nscholars. He specifies the<br />\n<br />\nKristin Comstock<br />\nProfessor Oreo Ittoom<br />\n<br />\npreferred quantications and<br />\nlists what must be included in<br />\nthe application. Because of<br />\nHopkins prestige and the difficulty of locating academic<br />\n.iobs these days, response to the<br />\nads is invariably tremendous.<br />\nHistory department Chairman ()rest Ranum estimated<br />\nthat approximately 3(X) applications are generally received for<br />\na position I he department<br />\n<br />\nadvertises. Political science<br />\ndepartment Chairman Matthew<br />\nCrenson estimates 60 to 100 applicants (though 200 applied<br />\nrecently for a position).<br />\nA second means of advertising an opening is to send letters<br />\nto \"training centers\" (the few<br />\nuniversities with departments<br />\nthat train grad students in the<br />\nvarious appropriate fields.)<br />\nThis approach is important for<br />\nsmall departments, like the<br />\nhistory of science department<br />\nwhich has a very limited number of programs from which to<br />\nchoose junior faculty members.<br />\nIn contrast, the math-science<br />\ndepartment has a standard list<br />\nof over 100 departments to<br />\nwhich it sends information on<br />\npositions opening up at Hopkins.<br />\nA third means of soliciting<br />\napplications is through the<br />\n\"grapevine\". The department<br />\nwrites to trusted leaders and<br />\ncontacts in the field who call<br />\nrecommend graduate students<br />\nor junior faculty members from<br />\ntheir own departments.<br />\n<br />\npart of his file is most important. But academic research is<br />\ngenerally the most critical consideration, though recommendations the applicant receives<br />\nfrom his faculty sponsor are<br />\noften equally important.<br />\nThe selection decision is based on \"the perceived potential\"<br />\nof the prospective candidate,<br />\naccording to Crenson. The<br />\nreputation of the University the<br />\ncandidate is currently involved<br />\nwith is \"important but not<br />\ndecisive,\" says Crenson. The<br />\nonly means of measuring teaching ability at this stage is<br />\nthrough the faculty recommendations, though often the<br />\napplicant's faculty sponsor has<br />\nnever seen him teach and has<br />\nlittle upon which to base a<br />\njudgement besides communication skills.<br />\n<br />\nResearch clearly plays a<br />\nmuch larger role in the selection<br />\nthan the teaching ability. As<br />\nmathematical sciences department Chairman Robert Serfling<br />\ncommented, \"We won't consider anyone mediocre in<br />\nresearch.\" Faculty members<br />\nThe hiring department soon can improve in teaching, but<br />\nreceives applications from in- they are not likely to improve<br />\nterested candidates.

Thomas, proposed this week<br />\nthat Americans of 18 years of age be compelled to spend one year performing national<br />\nservice. While the idea is not a new one, its<br />\nrecent attention indicates that serious consideration of such a plan may not be too far<br />\nin the future.<br />\nAccording to the plan proposed by Koch,<br />\nboth men and women reaching the age of 18<br />\nwould be given the choice of spending a year<br />\nperforming military or civilian service. The<br />\npeople who selected civilian service could<br />\nwork on environmental problems, as<br />\nteacher's aides, as tutors, or caring for the<br />\nelderly and sick. The rationale underlying<br />\ncivilian service is that it would benefit society<br />\nas well as American youth. The tasks performed could be targeted at major national<br />\nproblems. It would provide young adults<br />\nwith a meaningful role in society after high<br />\nschool and instill in them a sense of purpose.<br />\nIt is likely, however, that any serious proposal of this nature will meet with stiff<br />\nresistance among America's youth. The most<br />\nrepulsive aspect is compulsion. Many will<br />\nequate the program with \"forced labor.\"<br />\nFurthermore, it will interrupt the pattern of<br />\n<br />\nformal schooling for students wishing to pursue a post-secondary education. A third objection to the Koch proposal is that in the<br />\nabsence of a natural motivation, 18-year-olds<br />\nwill not perform their tasks competently.<br />\nA similar, but superior national youth service plan was offered several years ago by<br />\nJohns Hopkins University President Steven<br />\nMuller. Muller emphasized that the program<br />\nshould be voluntary with compelling incentives. He suggested that the plan provide<br />\nguaranteed job training and substantial<br />\nfederal assistance toward post-secondary<br />\neducation. Replacing current methods of obtaining federal financial aid, students would<br />\nearn their assistance through voluntary service. Only those who performed national service would recieve aid.<br />\nAt first glance, the idea of national youth<br />\nservice may seem radical, possibly abhorrent,<br />\nto America's young. However, the potential<br />\nbenefits of such a plan are likely to encourage a growing interest in the idea. Its implementation would greatly change American society and our educational system. The<br />\nFord Foundation recently approved a<br />\n$259,000 grant for a study of various models<br />\nfor such a program. If nothing else, the idea<br />\nof national youth service merits further investigation, consideration and debate.<br />\n<br />\nSave The SAC Seals<br />\nEach year the SAC awards honorary seals<br />\nto graduating seniors who have performed<br />\ndistinguished service to the student body.<br />\nWhile the list often resembles a who's who<br />\nof senior class officers, SAC Executive<br />\nBoard members and Student Council<br />\nleaders, this year's choices are unusually<br />\ngood. The SAC Executive Board's lengthy<br />\ndeliberations produced 21 recommendations.<br />\nThey made a sincere effort to give awards<br />\non the basis of effort, achievement and intent, rather than by title. As a result, some<br />\nundergraduates generally unpopular with<br />\nstudent leaders received seals.<br />\nNot all undergraduates are content with<br />\nthe SAC's choices. Some students who did<br />\nnot receive awards have complained that<br />\nthey deserve them. It is entirely possible that<br />\nthe SAC Executive Board neglected some<br />\n<br />\nworthy student or that some of the 21 choices<br />\nwere questionable. It is impossible to avoid<br />\nsome inequity. On the whole the list is extremely reasonable. Those who complain<br />\nthat they were unjustly by-passed are committing an ignoble act.<br />\nIn the real world, an SAC seal means very<br />\nlittle. It will not help anyone get a job. It is<br />\nmerely a nice gesture of respect for graduating seniors who have worked hard to help<br />\ntheir fellow students. An undergraduate truly<br />\ndedicated to student service will not care<br />\nwhether or not he is awarded a seal. The<br />\nmotives of the complainers are therefore<br />\nsuspect. Unless the entire process of distributing seals is abolished, the News-Letter<br />\nbelieves that seniors crying over lost seals<br />\nshould be ignored and that the present list<br />\nshould remain intact.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nsomehow undermine deterrence.

Accordingly,<br />\nit disappeared from my transcript. Upon receiving my fall<br />\ngrades, however, I was shocked to discover that the instructor had never altered his roster,<br />\nand that I had received an Incomplete. Once again, I had<br />\nthis removed from my transcript.<br />\nLast week, I went to get a<br />\ncopy of my transcript to send to<br />\na grad school, and was horrified to discover that the Incomplete had been replaced by<br />\na \"D.\" At first, the thought of<br />\nthe \"D\" scared the hell out of<br />\nme. But then, something even<br />\nmore unbelievable crossed my<br />\nmind. It seems that I had passed a Hopkins course without<br />\never having to attend. Since I<br />\ndropped the course before it<br />\neven started, I should have<br />\nreceived an \"F.\"<br />\nNow don't get me wrong, I<br />\nthink that there ought to be<br />\nsome courses that are easier<br />\nthan others; indeed, that is inevitable. But under no circumstances ought it be possible<br />\nto pass a course without ever<br />\ntaking it. The registrar explained that the professor or TA<br />\nprobably just wanted to be a<br />\nnice guy\u2014an admirable sentiment. Even so, such things<br />\nmake a mockery of the system.<br />\n<br />\nIt seems to me very stupid to<br />\ndebate the virtues of different<br />\ngrading systems when the disparity between the courses<br />\nthemselves make such distinctions ludicrous, as well as inapplicable. Why don't the policymakers at this University sit<br />\ndown and set minimum standards of achievement for individual courses? It does not<br />\nseem unreasonable to insist that<br />\na student must complete the<br />\ncoursework in order to pass. At<br />\nleast then, the distinctions<br />\nseemingly so crucial to the people who adopted plus/minus<br />\ngrading would have some<br />\nmeaning. As things stand now,<br />\nthe whole system is a farce.<br />\nDavid Hurwitz<br />\n<br />\nCampaign Posters<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs a member of the student<br />\nbody, I am once again confronted by a seemingly unending flow of' campaign posters<br />\nand leaflets. Possibly this year<br />\nthese fine upstanding individuals will restrict their selfendorsements to the already existing bulletin boards on campus. I don't vote for a candidate on the basis of how<br />\nmany times I see his/her name.<br />\nIn fact, most of us don't vote<br />\nat all.<br />\nIf these candidates are really<br />\nsincere in their desire to do<br />\nsomething for the school and<br />\nthe student body, maybe they<br />\nwill find it in themselves to pick<br />\nup all the garbage created by<br />\ntheir posters after the elections<br />\nare over.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nJohn Cooke<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nAndrew Hurley..................................Editor<br />\nGranville Greene, Alan karras<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nCharles Maine, Bruce Peltier<br />\nManaging Editors<br />\nMitchell Smith, Michael Vogelbaum<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nDebby Freedberg, Hunt Salisbury<br />\nFeatures Editors<br />\nDan Vitale........................................

We<br />\ndo have a very large number of<br />\npre-meds declared here, but are<br />\nall of them \"Fred Factorial\"<br />\ncartoon characters? The probability lies in the over-visibility<br />\nof certain groups because of<br />\ntheir difference from the \"collegiate.- Or, perhaps having<br />\nbecome the concept of the<br />\n\"average Hopkins student,\" we<br />\nare just viewing a self-fulfilling<br />\nprophecy in which certain types<br />\nare fixated upon due to their<br />\nfitting the preconceived<br />\nstereotype.<br />\nThe University, itself, provides a great many contradictions to the overly competitive<br />\nstudent notion. The academic<br />\nfreedom enjoyed here, from the<br />\n<br />\nease with which we change<br />\nclasses and majors to the<br />\navailability of research, independent study and area majors, is not generally found<br />\nelsewhere.

ROY<br />\nIn this piece, Robert Roy<br />\nrecalls the experiences of the<br />\n1928 Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nOlympic team.<br />\nFifty-five years ago,come<br />\nJuly 11, 18 lacrosse players,<br />\ntwo coaches and their wives,<br />\none manager and two<br />\nnewsmen sailed from New<br />\nYork on the S.S. President<br />\nRoosevelt, bound for<br />\nAmsterdam and the ninth<br />\nOlympic Games.<br />\nWe were lucky to be there.<br />\nWe had lost to Army and<br />\nNavy but had beaten<br />\nMaryland in the last game of<br />\nthe regular season and,<br />\nperhaps on this account, had<br />\nbeen included in a six-team<br />\nplayoff. We won over<br />\npreviously undefeated Mt.<br />\nWashington in the first<br />\nround (a game interrupted<br />\nby a cloudburst and<br />\nhailstorm), beat Army in the<br />\nsemifinal and again beat<br />\nMaryland, winner over<br />\nRutgers and Navy, in the<br />\nfinal.<br />\nNone of us will ever forget<br />\nthe voyage. The passenger<br />\nlist could be given in three<br />\nwords: American Olympic<br />\nTeam. There were runners,<br />\nboxers, swimmers, divers,<br />\nwrestlers, fencers, rowers,<br />\nhigh jumpers, cyclists,<br />\nequestrians, hurdlers and<br />\ngymnasts performing on<br />\nmats, springboards, a swimming<br />\npool,<br />\nrowing<br />\nmachines, parallel bars or a<br />\nrunning track laid round the<br />\ndeck. Our coach, Ray Van<br />\nOrman, had us run laps, and<br />\nthe four right-angle turns<br />\nwere hell on the calf of the<br />\noutboard leg. Marathon<br />\nrunners would run 30<br />\nminutes in one direction and<br />\nthen go the other way, talking all the while. Boxing,<br />\nwrestling and fencing involved actual matches and and<br />\nwere favorite spectator<br />\nsports\u2014much better than<br />\nwatching<br />\nJohnny<br />\nWeissmuller, not yet Tarzan,<br />\nswim against a restraining<br />\nrope.<br />\nThere were girls, too, and<br />\na few shipboard romances.<br />\nAdelaide Lambert, who won<br />\na gold medal swimming in<br />\nthe 4(X)-meter relay, was<br />\nkeen on Gard Mallonee, and<br />\nGeorgia<br />\nColeman, a<br />\nvivacious and curly blonde<br />\ndiver, fell hard for Bill<br />\nLogan. I got no farther than<br />\nholding hands with Albina<br />\nOsipowich on the foredeck<br />\nin rough weather. Albina<br />\nhad won the 100-meter<br />\nfreestyle and was a cute girl,<br />\nbut all of these romances last<br />\nonly as long as the<br />\nhomeward voyage.<br />\nTrack and field in the<br />\nOlympic Stadium were spectacular. Our runners were<br />\n<br />\nfavored but did badly. Betty Robinson won the<br />\n100 meter for women, but<br />\nthe only man to win a flat<br />\nrace was Ray Barbuti, who<br />\ndove headlong to win the<br />\n400 meter. Clarence Hauser,<br />\nwho, with other field men,<br />\nhad watched us practice,<br />\nmuffed two discus throws,<br />\nbut on his last chance set a<br />\nnew Olympic record. Paavo<br />\nNurmi and Willie Ritola of<br />\nFinland and Edwin Wide of<br />\nSweden lapped everyone else<br />\nin the 10,000 meter; Nurmi<br />\nbroke the world record by 18<br />\nseconds\u2014and then picked<br />\nup his sweat clothes and ran<br />\nthe length of the field to the<br />\ndressing room.<br />\nWe were in our dressing<br />\nroom waiting for the<br />\nmarathon to finish when<br />\nthey carried in Joie Ray, the<br />\nChicago cab driver who was<br />\nthe first American to finish,<br />\nin fifth place. He was in a<br />\nstate of collapse and they<br />\nhad to cut the shoes from his<br />\nswollen feet.<br />\nWe were there between the<br />\nhalves of our first game<br />\nagainst Canada and resumed play when the marathon,<br />\nexcept for stragglers, was<br />\nover. We won 6-3 but on the<br />\nfollowing day lost to<br />\nEngland 7-6. Two things<br />\nstick in my memory: An<br />\nEnglish attack man on a solo<br />\nclear came racthg in, tried to<br />\ndodge and lost the ball,<br />\nwhereupon a teammate<br />\nshouted,\"I say, toss it about<br />\na bit, Percival Craig!\"<br />\nWorse than that, we were<br />\ndenied a last-minute tying<br />\ngoal when the goal umpire<br />\nruled that Bill Logan was in<br />\nthe crease. The irony of this<br />\nwas our insistence as a team<br />\nthat there be a crease\u2014not<br />\nwanted by either Canada or<br />\nEngland.<br />\nCanada, having enjoyed a<br />\nday of rest, beat England on<br />\nthe final day 9-5, causing a<br />\ntriple-tie.<br />\nMost of us went down to<br />\nparis on the \"Etoile du<br />\nNord\" and did the kinds of<br />\nthings people do there: the<br />\nOpera, the. Louvre, the<br />\nFolies Bergere, Moulin<br />\nRouge and Casino de Paris,<br />\nnot necessarily in that order.<br />\nWith Lou Nixdorff and Bill<br />\nKegan, I stayed in a pension<br />\non the Sein at 37 Quay de St.<br />\nAugustin.

SI-1.9<br />\n<br />\nThis country's disastrous attempt at rescuing the hostages<br />\nin Iran confirmed for many the<br />\nimpotence of the American<br />\nmilitary. If the United States<br />\nwasn't able to operate helicopters properly in Iran, how<br />\ncould it possibly compete with<br />\nthe Soviet Union as a superpower? Did the U.S.'s only<br />\nstrength lie in its nuclear<br />\narsenal? Colonel Charlie<br />\nBeckwith, leader of the ill-fated<br />\nrescue attempt, has just written<br />\nhis version of the Iran rescue<br />\nmission, in Delta Force, the<br />\nstory of the development of the<br />\nAmerican military unit charged<br />\nwith combatting international<br />\nterrorism. The book is 300<br />\npages long, two-thirds of which<br />\nare devoted to Beckwith and his<br />\nattempts to promote the Delta<br />\nForce in the Army, and onethird to the development and<br />\nimplementation of the Iranian<br />\nhostage rescue mission.<br />\nBeckwith's discussion, in the<br />\n<br />\nfirst few chapters, of his experiences with the British<br />\nSpecial Air Services (SAS)<br />\nserves as a backdrop for the rest<br />\nof the book. The SAS had the<br />\ncapability that no force in the<br />\nU.S. had at the time. The U.S.<br />\nmilitary, Beckwith concluded<br />\nfrom his experiences with the<br />\nSAS,\"needed a unit that could<br />\ndo what the SAS could do. It<br />\nneeded to be able to go out in<br />\nsmall patrols and blow up<br />\nbridges and dams and railroad<br />\nlines, to take out an enemy<br />\ncommander, say, like Rommel,<br />\nto collect information for air<br />\nstrikes or for attacks made by<br />\nconventional forces.\" Beckwith<br />\nbecomes a crusader for an<br />\nAmerican SAS. He draws the<br />\nreader through his numerous<br />\nmilitary experiences, from the<br />\nSAS in Malta, to Special Forces<br />\nin Vietnam, to command of the<br />\nArmy Infantry's Florida Ranger<br />\nSchool, back to Vietnam, to<br />\nHawaii, to the Joint Casualty<br />\nResolution Center in Thailand,<br />\nto Commandant of the U.S.<br />\nSpecial Forces School in North<br />\nCarolina, to the development<br />\nof the Delta Force. He is found<br />\npushing throughout these tours<br />\n<br />\nof duty for an American SAS.<br />\nThis book provides a good<br />\ncase study in intermilitary<br />\nbureaucratic<br />\nstruggles.<br />\nBeckwith fights numerous battles with his immediate<br />\nsuperiors by trying to go over<br />\ntheir heads (when they're not<br />\ncooperative) in pushing for this<br />\nnew American force. He wins<br />\nsome and loses many battles.<br />\nBut his personality (or so he implies) and his persistence finally<br />\ninsure the development of the<br />\nAmerican anti-terrorist group<br />\nwhose mission he defines as:<br />\n\"freeing hostages in buildings<br />\nor in hijacked aircraft, being<br />\nable to operate with low visibility and, if necessary, to dress in<br />\ncivilian clothes or in disguises.\"<br />\nBut already existing special<br />\nforces are firmly resistant to the<br />\ncreation of a new anti-terrorist<br />\ndivision, and oftentimes the<br />\ngoodwill of Beckwith's superiors<br />\nisn't forthcoming, in which case<br />\nhe must find means outside the<br />\nrigid military hierarchy to state<br />\nhis case for this new force.<br />\nBeckwith eventually gets the attention of the Army's Deputy<br />\nChief of Staff, Edward Meyer,<br />\nwho in some sense is the hero<br />\nof this book. It is through<br />\nMeyer's continued attention<br />\nand support that the Delta<br />\nForce finally gets off the<br />\nground.<br />\nColonel Beckwith's encounters with the civilian<br />\nleadership are particularly<br />\nrevealing. We find VicePresident Walter Mondale<br />\nplaying 'with Beckwith's handcuffs during the Iran rescue<br />\nbriefing in the White House.<br />\nWe find Undersecretary of<br />\nState Warren Christopher concerned about the Delta Force<br />\nkilling the Iranian guards at the<br />\nAmerican embassy. And we<br />\n<br />\nfind Beckwith at his bluntest in<br />\ndiscussing his briefing of the<br />\ncivilian leadership before the<br />\nIran mission when he candidly<br />\npoints out:<br />\nWe were going to kill every guard in the<br />\nfour or five buildings and anyone who<br />\ninterfered in the assault. Any armed<br />\nIranian inside the buildings would be<br />\nkilled. We weren't going to go up and<br />\ncheck their pulses. We would put<br />\nenough copper and lead in them so they<br />\nwouldn't be a problem. When blood<br />\nbegan to flow, a lot of Iranians were going to turn and run for help, and when<br />\nthey did, Delta was prepared to hose<br />\nthem down. No question about it. That<br />\nwas the plan. Furthermore, I did not<br />\nbelieve that the Iranians in the embassy<br />\nwould stand toe to toe and slug it out.<br />\nYes, there would be the odd person who<br />\nwould because of his religion and beliefs<br />\nshoot to the death. We were prepared<br />\nto help him reach his maker.<br />\n<br />\nBeckwith's candid rhetoric certainly makes for entertaining<br />\nreading.<br />\nThe picture painted of President Carter is highly complimentary. Carter apparently<br />\ninstructs Beckwith to tell his<br />\nmen that if the mission fails, it<br />\nis his fault, not theirs. And<br />\nwhen the Force returns after the<br />\nfailed attempt, he remarks<br />\n(after having spent a few<br />\nminutes with each survivor of<br />\nthe mission): \"I have been<br />\nremiss in not knowing more<br />\nabout Delta Force. I am very<br />\nimpressed with what I've<br />\nlearned about them and what<br />\nI've seen today. I didn't know<br />\nwe still had people like this who<br />\nwould sacrifice everything for<br />\ntheir country. Colonel Beckwith, I am very proud of these<br />\nmen.\"<br />\nThe mission's failure was<br />\nclearly due to technical failures<br />\nin the Iranian desert (Beckwith<br />\nremarks that it is appalling that<br />\nthe helicopters didn't fly with<br />\nmechanics who would be able<br />\n<br />\nto repair them in the event of<br />\ntechnical<br />\ndifficulties).<br />\nBeckwith, in responding to<br />\nSenator Sam Nunn of the<br />\nSenate Armed Services Committee, contends that what he<br />\nlearned from the mission was<br />\nthat: \"...Murphy is alive and<br />\nwell. He's in every drawer,<br />\nunder every rock and on top of<br />\nevery hill.\" The mission's<br />\nfailure, he claims, was due to<br />\n\"purely bad luck.\"<br />\nThe major downfall of this<br />\nbook is its excessively long<br />\ndiscussion of the Force's origins<br />\nand the all too brief discussion<br />\nof the Iranian rescue mission.<br />\nThe preface introduces the<br />\nreader to the White House's<br />\nrole in the mission and leaves<br />\nthe reader with a feeling of<br />\nsuspense and excitement. But<br />\nthe reader is forced to wait for<br />\nanother 200 pages td go by<br />\nbefore he is rewarded with a<br />\ndiscussion of Iran. By this time<br />\nhe has lost most of his interest<br />\nin the subject. If the rescue mission had been a grand success,<br />\nthen the reader would have<br />\nbeen more interested in how<br />\nthis American force came into<br />\nbeing and what factors contributed to its success. Since the<br />\nostensible reason for considering this book is what it has to<br />\nsay about the Iran rescue mission, it leaves the reader with<br />\ngreat disappointment\u2014most of<br />\nthe book has nothing to do with<br />\nthat mission.

He looked<br />\nanything but Russian; his Lee<br />\njeans, white T-shirt, Adidas<br />\ntennis shoes, and backpack<br />\nreminded me of a typical<br />\nAmerican university student.<br />\nWhen he began to speak,<br />\napologizing for the interruption, I noticed that his English<br />\nwas smooth and virtually accetitless. A thought flashed<br />\nthrough my mind: Could it be<br />\nthat, after only a week in the<br />\nSoviet Union, I had stumbled<br />\nacross another American, and<br />\na college student at that? When<br />\nI incredulously asked him if he<br />\nwas American, he laughed; no,<br />\nhe was a student at the University of Leningrad. His name<br />\nwas Valery. I complimented<br />\nValery on his English, and we<br />\nchatted a little about my stay in<br />\nthe Soviet Union. He was<br />\nespecially delighted to find out<br />\nthat I was an American.<br />\nThen he suddenly shifted the<br />\nconversation to the area of his<br />\ntrue concern. Was I, by any<br />\nchance, interested in trading or<br />\nselling something I had with<br />\nme? He would pay me well for<br />\nmy shoes, my shirt, my corduroy pants, or my backpack.<br />\nOr perhaps I had something in<br />\nmy hotel room that he was<br />\nlooking for: American tapes<br />\nand records, jeans, magazines,<br />\nsweaters, and so on. If I did not<br />\nwant cash\u2014he and I both knew<br />\nthe risks of carrying large<br />\namounts of money out of the<br />\ncountry\u2014I could trade my<br />\ngoods for some of his own<br />\nitems; he offered me Russian<br />\nflags, a soldier's uniform, dolls,<br />\ncommemorative<br />\nposters,<br />\npins...And the list went on.<br />\nScenes like this one recurred<br />\ncountless times during my trip<br />\nto the Soviet Union. I was there<br />\non a program, organized by the<br />\nUniversity of New Hampshire,<br />\nthat takes fifty college-age<br />\nLeningrad,<br />\nstudents to<br />\nMoscow, and Tallin. The trip's<br />\nprimary purpose was to improve the students' command<br />\nof the Russian language.

I remember one particular walk down Nevsky Prospect when I was accosted by no<br />\nless than seven on-the-street<br />\nsalesmen. Their favorite tactic<br />\nwas to ask for the time in Russian.

This, she<br />\nsaid, was the Hermitage<br />\nmuseum.(At last, I thought, I<br />\nreally am in Leningrad!)<br />\nOur conversation was interrupted only by the occasional<br />\nappearance of policemen walking their beats. When she would<br />\nspy one in the distance, Nina<br />\nwould hush me, put the twig in<br />\nher mouth, and begin to hum<br />\nsoftly.

After expounding to me on the horrors<br />\nthe war wreaked on Leningrad \u2022<br />\nand his own personal losses, he<br />\ninvited me to his apartment.<br />\nThere I met his wife, a retired<br />\n<br />\nX view of the Neva River<br />\n<br />\ngrade school teacher. We spent<br />\nthe whole evening together<br />\naround their kitchen table; we<br />\ntalked about everything from<br />\nthe cleverness of their 6-yearold granddaughter to the<br />\nliterature of Dostoevsky.<br />\nI was consistently started by<br />\nthe openness of the Russians,<br />\ncoupled with their strong desire<br />\nto talk to an American. I found<br />\nthis curiousity even in some of<br />\nthe illegal street traders and in<br />\nRussians who had already met<br />\nmany Americans. (One<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nbiologist who claimed to know<br />\nat least 20 Americans still had<br />\na small dinner party for me, to<br />\nwhich he invited several of his<br />\nfriends.) Surprisingly few of<br />\nthem wanted to discuss politics<br />\nor nuclear diplomacy. They did<br />\nnot want to see another superPower; they wanted to see an ordinary person, talk to him, examine him, and marvel at how<br />\npeople can be molded by vastly different societies but still remain basically the same.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Band<br />\nPRESENTS ITS ANNUAL<br />\n<br />\nHOPS POPS CONCERT<br />\n<br />\nA UDLT1QNs<br />\nr)<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\nLAWRENCE SPRINGER, Director<br />\n8:00 p.m.<br />\nThe Glass Pavilion<br />\nNovember 20, 1983<br />\nMake reservations now\u2014this event has always sold out.<br />\nMake check ($1.50 for students, $3.00 for non-students)<br />\npayable to JHU Alumni Association.<br />\nMAIL TO: \"Hops Pops\"<br />\n3211 N.

The actors<br />\nrarely leave this room, so that<br />\nthe play is set unusually far<br />\nback on the stage. This distance<br />\nfrom the audience, while at first<br />\ndistracting, emphasizes that this<br />\nis, as Williams called it, a play<br />\nof memory. Viewed through<br />\nthe lens of time and space, the<br />\nactions are at once isolated and<br />\nmade smaller, as if the audience, too, is recalling these<br />\nevents rather than viewing them<br />\nfor the first time. Against this<br />\nsetting, the astonishing cast<br />\nenacts the small tragedy of the<br />\nWingfield family and their<br />\ngentleman caller perhaps as well<br />\nas it has ever been played.<br />\nThe production stars Jessica<br />\nTandy, Amanda Plummer, and<br />\nBruce Davison as the<br />\nWingfields and John Heard as<br />\nthe gentleman caller. The extraordinary Miss Tandy dominates the first act and the opening of the second; alternately<br />\nshrill, nostalgic, bitter, and<br />\nbrave, she evokes the complex<br />\ncharacter of the mother<br />\nremarkably. At her most<br />\nbrutally manipulative, she is<br />\nterrifying; reminiscing about an<br />\nafternoon in her youth when<br />\nseventeen<br />\nshe<br />\nreceived<br />\ngentleman callers, she is wistful<br />\nand moving. When, in the second act, she dances with an<br />\narmload of jonquils recalling<br />\nhow she once conquered the<br />\ncotillion, the audience burst into applause. It is hardly<br />\nnecessary to mention Miss Tandy's status on the American<br />\nstage; she is one of the few living actresses about whom one<br />\ncould tell one's children, proudly, \"I saw her act.\"<br />\n<br />\nAmanda Plummer, who<br />\nplays the crippled and cripplingly shy daughter, may attain<br />\nthat status as well if she continues her phenomenal career.<br />\nShe is superb as Laura<br />\nWingfield; her enormously<br />\nphysical acting made the halting<br />\nand withdrawn daughter utterly true. During the second act,<br />\nher awkward blossoming was<br />\nevoked by a palpable loosening<br />\nof Plummer's tense, constrained body; then, at her final rejection, she seemed to actually<br />\nphysically retract into herself.<br />\nPlummer is compelling, even in<br />\nscenes where she has no lines;<br />\nher dreamy presence is enough<br />\nto remind the audience of the<br />\ntension between the three family members.<br />\nTom Wingfield, the angry<br />\npoet, is also brilliantly acted by<br />\nBruce Davison. Though<br />\nDavison seemed stiff at first, he<br />\nwarmed up rapidly and eventually nearly stole the play from<br />\nPlummer and Tandy. While his<br />\naccent wavered alarmingly<br />\nfrom a perceptible drawl to<br />\nsomething that was far from<br />\nSouthern, he was commanding<br />\nand convincing all the same.<br />\nHis scenes with Plummer, in<br />\nparticular, were filled with a<br />\nkind of edgy, almost manic<br />\ntenderness; his final soliloquy,<br />\nagainst the candle-lit still life of<br />\nhis mother and sister, was<br />\nastonishing.<br />\nJohn Heard, another<br />\ntalented actor, was disappoin.ting here. In his long scene with<br />\nLaura, the necessary tension<br />\nwas lacking; he plays the lovemaking a bit too earnestly, not<br />\nbluffly enough to prepare the<br />\naudience for his final betrayal<br />\nof the Wingfields' dreams. He<br />\nmoved through the scene nearly as awkwardly as Laura, when<br />\none wanted a looser, more<br />\ncomfortable, arm-swinging Jim<br />\nto play off the physical and<br />\n<br />\nThe cast of GIss Menagerie<br />\n<br />\nmental restraints that trap the proper response of a gentleLaura. Neither Jim-as-charmer man caller to a Southern belle.<br />\nHeard is the only weak point<br />\nnor Jim-as-disappointeddreamer was altogether suc- in the production. The staging,<br />\ncessful; though occasionally a with its muted light and<br />\nspark or two flew, the isolated, lens-like set (designed<br />\nchemistry was intermittent, un- by Tony-award winner Ming<br />\nsustained. He was at his best Cho Lee), locates this play as<br />\nwhen playing off Tandy; inno- one of memory and, perhaps,<br />\ncent of her plans, he is half- redemption, as Williams incharmed, half-mystified by her tended; and the remarkable cast<br />\nhysterical, flirtatious chatter. makes this particular rendition<br />\nThe emotions evoked in him are of The Glass Menagerie as<br />\n<br />\nPress Photo<br />\n<br />\nmemorable as is the text itself.<br />\n\"The Glass Menagerie\" is<br />\nplaying through November 19<br />\nat the Mechanic Theatre,<br />\nBaltimore, with evening performances Monday through Saturday at 8 p.m. and matinees<br />\nWednesday and Saturday at 2<br />\np.m. Call 625-1400forfurther<br />\ninforamtion and availability of<br />\nstudent rush tickets.<br />\n<br />\nPryor's Here and Now; Leave It There and Then<br />\nby Michael Lorton<br />\nRichard Pryor, although he<br />\nis not the two funniest words in<br />\ncomedy, is very funny. The ads<br />\nfor his newest movie, Richard<br />\nPryor\u2014Here and Now, made<br />\nthe movie look quite good.<br />\nHowever, the movie itself gets<br />\noff to a bad start: the first five<br />\nminutes are an ill-edited collage<br />\nof night-club footage, solemnly inane personal interviews<br />\nwith Pryor, and testimonials by<br />\njes' plain folk, outside a theater<br />\nwhere, presumably, Pryor has<br />\nperformed.<br />\nFrom this weak opening, the<br />\nrest of Here and Now, a concert filmed live in New Orleans<br />\ndeteriorates drastically.<br />\n\"I've been off drugs for<br />\nseven months,\" Richard Pryor<br />\nsays, several times during the<br />\nfilm. \"Really. Don't you<br />\nbelieve me?\" Really, I don't<br />\ncare, except that after I have<br />\nheard him say it three or four<br />\ntimes, I know what comes next.<br />\n<br />\nRichard Pryor's latest jus1 isn't rtinn).<br />\n<br />\nHe launches himself into a<br />\nseries of renditions of all the<br />\nnoises he used to make when he<br />\nwas stoned: trying to talk, trying to sing, trying, successfully, to throw up. It -isn't as<br />\nrevolting as it sounds, but it<br />\nisn't funny at all. He also re-<br />\n<br />\nenacts all the different ways he<br />\nused to walk and then fall<br />\ndown. This isn't funny either.<br />\nIn fact, most of the movie<br />\nisn't funny. Whenever Pryor<br />\nthinks the audience might have<br />\nheard enough of his vomit<br />\nnoises(and his timing for such<br />\n<br />\nthings is enormously slow) he<br />\nswitches to more chancy<br />\nmaterials like \"dick jokes.\" His<br />\nidea of a smooth transition is to<br />\njump up off the stage floor<br />\nwhere he has just collapsed and<br />\nsay,\"When I was twenty, I used to fuck all day.\" After a few<br />\nmore minutes of stupid sex<br />\njokes, he starts all over again<br />\nwith vomit noises.<br />\nFor two hours.<br />\nThe most depressing thing<br />\nabout seeing this movie (other<br />\nthan thinking about the two<br />\ndollars you paid to get in) is the<br />\nfact that a lot of people are<br />\nlaughing. A man in the New<br />\nOrleans auditorium where Here<br />\nand Now is filmed is late getting<br />\nto his seat, and Pryor remonstrates, \"Sit down, motherfucker.\" The audience in New<br />\nOrleans, and several months<br />\nlater in Baltimore, goes crazy<br />\nwith laughter. Standards so<br />\nabysmally low can only be painful to a comedy fan; I felt<br />\nhumiliated even to be in the<br />\n<br />\ntheater, and I sat there wishing<br />\nHere and Now was either in<br />\nsome other place or at some<br />\nother time, preferably both.<br />\nToward the end of the concert, Pryor decides, rightly in<br />\nmy view, that his bent is not<br />\ncomedy, but social criticism.<br />\nHe mumbles a long and faithful<br />\nimpersonation of a teen-age<br />\nheroin addict, blaming society<br />\nfor his plight. Nobody, not<br />\neven the hyena seated immediately behind me, laughed<br />\nduring this segment.<br />\nAfter fifteen minutes of<br />\nPryor's playing the drug addict<br />\nand one more \"dick joke,\" the<br />\nconcert comes to a merciful<br />\n\u2022end.<br />\nI feel ripped off. If I had<br />\nwanted to listen to drug addict,<br />\nI could have walked down to<br />\nthe Block. If I had wanted to<br />\nhear vomit noises and adolescent sex humor, I could have<br />\ngone to a frat party.

During these<br />\nyears, there has been a high<br />\nturnover rate of students. There<br />\nare usually twenty-five to forty<br />\nnew students at the beginning<br />\nof each semester; however, as<br />\nthe semester continues, the<br />\nenrollment declines due to increasing amounts of school<br />\nwork and other commitments.<br />\nThis decline is unfortunate<br />\nbecause it takes more than a<br />\ncouple of months to even<br />\ndiscover what karate is all<br />\nabout. I have been a member of<br />\nthe club since the second<br />\nsemester of my freshman year,<br />\nand I have begun to gain some<br />\ninsight in the nature of<br />\nkarate-do.<br />\nMany people, including myself, before my training began,<br />\nthink of karate as just a physical art. Misguided views of<br />\nkarate and other martial arts<br />\nare produced by movies which<br />\ndepict karate as a mystical art<br />\nthat enables a person to chop<br />\ntrees with his bare hands, to<br />\ndefeat a whole legion without<br />\nbreaking a sweat, and to jump<br />\nin the air and remain there long<br />\nenough to read the Sunday New<br />\nYork Times. However, a person practicing karate for a year<br />\nwill discover that karate includes both physical and mental aspects. As a form of exercise, karate is ideal. Firstly,<br />\nkarate exercises the mind and<br />\nbody. Secondly, one can practice karate for a whole lifetime.<br />\nFinally, men, women, and chil-<br />\n<br />\ndren of all ages can practice<br />\nkarate.<br />\nIn terms of physical development, the numerous karate<br />\ntechniques utilize a major portion of the body muscles.<br />\nThrough daily practicing, one<br />\nslowly develops strength and<br />\ncontrol in one's muscles. The<br />\nkarateka (karate student) does<br />\nnot need to develop excessive<br />\nstrength or bulk to be effective.<br />\nInstead, he relies on timing, the<br />\nrapid contraction and relaxation of muscles, and speed to<br />\nmake his techniques effective.<br />\nA good example ot this occurred at one of the intercollegiate tournaments last<br />\nyear. Hiroyoshi Okazaki from<br />\nTemple University was matched<br />\nagainst a Drexel University student in free sparring. Okazaki<br />\nis 5'2\" and weighs about 115<br />\nlbs. His opponent was,6'4\" and<br />\nweighed at least 190 lbs. The<br />\nmatch started slowly, but after<br />\na few minutes, Okazaki simply<br />\noverwhelmed his opponent with<br />\ndouble front kicks and forward<br />\npunches. Okazaki's abilities in<br />\nkarate are similar to Wayne<br />\nGretzky's abilities in ice<br />\nhockey. Both men are small<br />\ncompared to their opponents,<br />\nbut they are able to dominate<br />\ntheir opponents through finesse, superior ability developed<br />\nfrom years of practice, and<br />\nstrong fighting spirit.<br />\nIn terms of mental development, karate is a great discipline builder. This happens as<br />\none pushes himself to perform<br />\ntechniques over and over again.<br />\nAnother mental aspect is that a<br />\nkarateka must always imagine<br />\n<br />\nan opponent when he practices<br />\ntechniques. One can practice a<br />\ntechnique a million times, but<br />\nthe practice will be a total waste<br />\nof time unless he imagines an<br />\nopponent. Karate also prepares<br />\na person to handle stressful<br />\nsituations. When a karateka<br />\nbegins free sparring, he must<br />\ncalm his mind and spirit. The<br />\nslightest bit of fear will cause<br />\ntunnel vision or momentary paralysis when the opponent attacks. Tunnel vision occurs<br />\nwhen the karateka's fear of the<br />\nopponent causes his eye to<br />\nfocus only on any slight movements made by his opponent.<br />\nThis tunnel vision causes the<br />\nkarateka to lose sight of the<br />\nwhole opponent; thus, the<br />\nkarateka is easily defeated. To<br />\novercome this tunnel vision, the<br />\nkarateka must realize that his<br />\nfear does not emanate from his<br />\nopponent but from his own<br />\nmind. Once the karateka controls his fear, he will be better<br />\nable to handle his opponent.<br />\nThis control of one's emotions<br />\nin facing an opponent can be<br />\napplied to everyday problems.<br />\nOne needs to have a clear and<br />\nalert mind without hindrance<br />\nfrom emotions to deal with<br />\nproblems correctly and<br />\neffectively.<br />\nThe mental and physical aspects of karate are embodied in<br />\nkata. Kata is a set of choreographed moves in which a karateka fights imaginary opponents. When a karateka practices kata, he can imagine his<br />\nopponents to have different<br />\nsizes, speed, and ability. Thus<br />\nthe karateka fights imaginary<br />\n<br />\nopponents. And this imagination becomes a deadly<br />\ndance. From a physical standpoint, kata has fast moves<br />\nwhich develop efficient contraction and relaxation of muscles<br />\nand slow moves which develop<br />\nmuscles isometrically. Also,<br />\nproper breathing technique is<br />\ndeveloped in, kata.<br />\nThe mental and physical'aspects of karate are geared<br />\ntoward one goal. No, karate<br />\nwas not developed to enable<br />\none person to beat the brains<br />\nout of another person. Master<br />\nGichin Funakoshi, the founder<br />\nof Shotokan karate, asserted<br />\n<br />\nthat, \"The ultimate aim of the<br />\nart of karate lies not in victory.<br />\nor defeat but in the perfection<br />\nof the character of its participants.\"<br />\nIn conclusion, I would like to<br />\nsay that it is still possible to<br />\njoin any of the four martial arts<br />\nclubs.<br />\nAikido club: Mon, Wed<br />\n6:30-8:00 Wrestling Room<br />\nJHU Karate Club (Shotokan<br />\nKarate): Tues,Thurs 8:00-930<br />\nWrestling Room<br />\nJudo Club: Mon, Wed<br />\n8:00-9:30 Wrestling Room<br />\nTae Kwan do: Wed 6:30-8:00<br />\nSat 11:00-12:00 a.m.<br />\n<br />\nSize is not necessary to star in karate.<br />\n<br />\n\f18/NOVEMBER 11, 1983<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jay Harriers Place Twentieth In MAC's<br />\nby Vivek Samnotra<br />\nThe harriers ran their hardest<br />\nrace of the season at MAC's<br />\nand broke into the MAC top<br />\ntwenty at Indian Gap, Pennsylvania.

What possessed him<br />\nto come here? What possessed<br />\nthe department to bring him<br />\nhere? Specifically, how are<br />\njumor faculty members recruited at Hopkins?<br />\nThe process begins when a<br />\ndepartment decides it needs a<br />\nnew faculty member in a particular subject area. For instance, the history department<br />\ndiscovers that it is short on professors or that it has just lost a<br />\nleading expert in Russian history to retirement.<br />\nThe department chair talks<br />\nwith the Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences about a new or reolacement position in Russian<br />\n\u2022 history, and they agree that if<br />\na suitable candidate can be<br />\nfound for a junior faculty position, the dean will make sure<br />\nmoney is provided. If the dean<br />\nfinds the School ot Nrts and<br />\nSciences is in difficult economic<br />\nstraits, he may veto any proposed department expansion.<br />\nThe department chairman<br />\nthen proceeds to advertise in<br />\nt hose publications most likely<br />\nto be read by Russian history<br />\nscholars. He specifies the<br /><br />\nKristin Comstock<br />\nProfessor Oreo Ittoom<br /><br />\npreferred quantications and<br />\nlists what must be included in<br />\nthe application. Because of<br />\nHopkins prestige and the difficulty of locating academic<br />\n.iobs these days, response to the<br />\nads is invariably tremendous.<br />\nHistory department Chairman ()rest Ranum estimated<br />\nthat approximately 3(X) applications are generally received for<br />\na position I he department<br /><br />\nadvertises. Political science<br />\ndepartment Chairman Matthew<br />\nCrenson estimates 60 to 100 applicants (though 200 applied<br />\nrecently for a position).<br />\nA second means of advertising an opening is to send letters<br />\nto \"training centers\" (the few<br />\nuniversities with departments<br />\nthat train grad students in the<br />\nvarious appropriate fields.)<br />\nThis approach is important for<br />\nsmall departments, like the<br />\nhistory of science department<br />\nwhich has a very limited number of programs from which to<br />\nchoose junior faculty members.<br />\nIn contrast, the math-science<br />\ndepartment has a standard list<br />\nof over 100 departments to<br />\nwhich it sends information on<br />\npositions opening up at Hopkins.<br />\nA third means of soliciting<br />\napplications is through the<br />\n\"grapevine\". The department<br />\nwrites to trusted leaders and<br />\ncontacts in the field who call<br />\nrecommend graduate students<br />\nor junior faculty members from<br />\ntheir own departments.<br /><br />\npart of his file is most important. But academic research is<br />\ngenerally the most critical consideration, though recommendations the applicant receives<br />\nfrom his faculty sponsor are<br />\noften equally important.<br />\nThe selection decision is based on \"the perceived potential\"<br />\nof the prospective candidate,<br />\naccording to Crenson. The<br />\nreputation of the University the<br />\ncandidate is currently involved<br />\nwith is \"important but not<br />\ndecisive,\" says Crenson. The<br />\nonly means of measuring teaching ability at this stage is<br />\nthrough the faculty recommendations, though often the<br />\napplicant's faculty sponsor has<br />\nnever seen him teach and has<br />\nlittle upon which to base a<br />\njudgement besides communication skills.<br /><br />\nResearch clearly plays a<br />\nmuch larger role in the selection<br />\nthan the teaching ability.

Thomas, proposed this week<br />\nthat Americans of 18 years of age be compelled to spend one year performing national<br />\nservice. While the idea is not a new one, its<br />\nrecent attention indicates that serious consideration of such a plan may not be too far<br />\nin the future.<br />\nAccording to the plan proposed by Koch,<br />\nboth men and women reaching the age of 18<br />\nwould be given the choice of spending a year<br />\nperforming military or civilian service. The<br />\npeople who selected civilian service could<br />\nwork on environmental problems, as<br />\nteacher's aides, as tutors, or caring for the<br />\nelderly and sick. The rationale underlying<br />\ncivilian service is that it would benefit society<br />\nas well as American youth. The tasks performed could be targeted at major national<br />\nproblems. It would provide young adults<br />\nwith a meaningful role in society after high<br />\nschool and instill in them a sense of purpose.<br />\nIt is likely, however, that any serious proposal of this nature will meet with stiff<br />\nresistance among America's youth. The most<br />\nrepulsive aspect is compulsion. Many will<br />\nequate the program with \"forced labor.\"<br />\nFurthermore, it will interrupt the pattern of<br /><br />\nformal schooling for students wishing to pursue a post-secondary education. A third objection to the Koch proposal is that in the<br />\nabsence of a natural motivation, 18-year-olds<br />\nwill not perform their tasks competently.<br />\nA similar, but superior national youth service plan was offered several years ago by<br />\nJohns Hopkins University President Steven<br />\nMuller. Muller emphasized that the program<br />\nshould be voluntary with compelling incentives. He suggested that the plan provide<br />\nguaranteed job training and substantial<br />\nfederal assistance toward post-secondary<br />\neducation. Replacing current methods of obtaining federal financial aid, students would<br />\nearn their assistance through voluntary service. Only those who performed national service would recieve aid.<br />\nAt first glance, the idea of national youth<br />\nservice may seem radical, possibly abhorrent,<br />\nto America's young. However, the potential<br />\nbenefits of such a plan are likely to encourage a growing interest in the idea. Its implementation would greatly change American society and our educational system. The<br />\nFord Foundation recently approved a<br />\n$259,000 grant for a study of various models<br />\nfor such a program. If nothing else, the idea<br />\nof national youth service merits further investigation, consideration and debate.<br /><br />\nSave The SAC Seals<br />\nEach year the SAC awards honorary seals<br />\nto graduating seniors who have performed<br />\ndistinguished service to the student body.<br />\nWhile the list often resembles a who's who<br />\nof senior class officers, SAC Executive<br />\nBoard members and Student Council<br />\nleaders, this year's choices are unusually<br />\ngood. The SAC Executive Board's lengthy<br />\ndeliberations produced 21 recommendations.<br />\nThey made a sincere effort to give awards<br />\non the basis of effort, achievement and intent, rather than by title. As a result, some<br />\nundergraduates generally unpopular with<br />\nstudent leaders received seals.<br />\nNot all undergraduates are content with<br />\nthe SAC's choices. Some students who did<br />\nnot receive awards have complained that<br />\nthey deserve them. It is entirely possible that<br />\nthe SAC Executive Board neglected some<br /><br />\nworthy student or that some of the 21 choices<br />\nwere questionable. It is impossible to avoid<br />\nsome inequity. On the whole the list is extremely reasonable. Those who complain<br />\nthat they were unjustly by-passed are committing an ignoble act.<br />\nIn the real world, an SAC seal means very<br />\nlittle. It will not help anyone get a job. It is<br />\nmerely a nice gesture of respect for graduating seniors who have worked hard to help<br />\ntheir fellow students. An undergraduate truly<br />\ndedicated to student service will not care<br />\nwhether or not he is awarded a seal. The<br />\nmotives of the complainers are therefore<br />\nsuspect. Unless the entire process of distributing seals is abolished, the News-Letter<br />\nbelieves that seniors crying over lost seals<br />\nshould be ignored and that the present list<br />\nshould remain intact.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nsomehow undermine deterrence.

Accordingly,<br />\nit disappeared from my transcript. Upon receiving my fall<br />\ngrades, however, I was shocked to discover that the instructor had never altered his roster,<br />\nand that I had received an Incomplete. Once again, I had<br />\nthis removed from my transcript.<br />\nLast week, I went to get a<br />\ncopy of my transcript to send to<br />\na grad school, and was horrified to discover that the Incomplete had been replaced by<br />\na \"D.\" At first, the thought of<br />\nthe \"D\" scared the hell out of<br />\nme. But then, something even<br />\nmore unbelievable crossed my<br />\nmind. It seems that I had passed a Hopkins course without<br />\never having to attend. Since I<br />\ndropped the course before it<br />\neven started, I should have<br />\nreceived an \"F.\"<br />\nNow don't get me wrong, I<br />\nthink that there ought to be<br />\nsome courses that are easier<br />\nthan others; indeed, that is inevitable. But under no circumstances ought it be possible<br />\nto pass a course without ever<br />\ntaking it. The registrar explained that the professor or TA<br />\nprobably just wanted to be a<br />\nnice guy\u2014an admirable sentiment. Even so, such things<br />\nmake a mockery of the system.<br /><br />\nIt seems to me very stupid to<br />\ndebate the virtues of different<br />\ngrading systems when the disparity between the courses<br />\nthemselves make such distinctions ludicrous, as well as inapplicable. Why don't the policymakers at this University sit<br />\ndown and set minimum standards of achievement for individual courses? It does not<br />\nseem unreasonable to insist that<br />\na student must complete the<br />\ncoursework in order to pass.

We<br />\ndo have a very large number of<br />\npre-meds declared here, but are<br />\nall of them \"Fred Factorial\"<br />\ncartoon characters? The probability lies in the over-visibility<br />\nof certain groups because of<br />\ntheir difference from the \"collegiate.- Or, perhaps having<br />\nbecome the concept of the<br />\n\"average Hopkins student,\" we<br />\nare just viewing a self-fulfilling<br />\nprophecy in which certain types<br />\nare fixated upon due to their<br />\nfitting the preconceived<br />\nstereotype.<br />\nThe University, itself, provides a great many contradictions to the overly competitive<br />\nstudent notion. The academic<br />\nfreedom enjoyed here, from the<br /><br />\nease with which we change<br />\nclasses and majors to the<br />\navailability of research, independent study and area majors, is not generally found<br />\nelsewhere.

ROY<br />\nIn this piece, Robert Roy<br />\nrecalls the experiences of the<br />\n1928 Hopkins lacrosse<br />\nOlympic team.<br />\nFifty-five years ago,come<br />\nJuly 11, 18 lacrosse players,<br />\ntwo coaches and their wives,<br />\none manager and two<br />\nnewsmen sailed from New<br />\nYork on the S.S. President<br />\nRoosevelt, bound for<br />\nAmsterdam and the ninth<br />\nOlympic Games.<br />\nWe were lucky to be there.<br />\nWe had lost to Army and<br />\nNavy but had beaten<br />\nMaryland in the last game of<br />\nthe regular season and,<br />\nperhaps on this account, had<br />\nbeen included in a six-team<br />\nplayoff. We won over<br />\npreviously undefeated Mt.<br />\nWashington in the first<br />\nround (a game interrupted<br />\nby a cloudburst and<br />\nhailstorm), beat Army in the<br />\nsemifinal and again beat<br />\nMaryland, winner over<br />\nRutgers and Navy, in the<br />\nfinal.<br />\nNone of us will ever forget<br />\nthe voyage. The passenger<br />\nlist could be given in three<br />\nwords: American Olympic<br />\nTeam. There were runners,<br />\nboxers, swimmers, divers,<br />\nwrestlers, fencers, rowers,<br />\nhigh jumpers, cyclists,<br />\nequestrians, hurdlers and<br />\ngymnasts performing on<br />\nmats, springboards, a swimming<br />\npool,<br />\nrowing<br />\nmachines, parallel bars or a<br />\nrunning track laid round the<br />\ndeck. Our coach, Ray Van<br />\nOrman, had us run laps, and<br />\nthe four right-angle turns<br />\nwere hell on the calf of the<br />\noutboard leg. Marathon<br />\nrunners would run 30<br />\nminutes in one direction and<br />\nthen go the other way, talking all the while. Boxing,<br />\nwrestling and fencing involved actual matches and and<br />\nwere favorite spectator<br />\nsports\u2014much better than<br />\nwatching<br />\nJohnny<br />\nWeissmuller, not yet Tarzan,<br />\nswim against a restraining<br />\nrope.<br />\nThere were girls, too, and<br />\na few shipboard romances.<br />\nAdelaide Lambert, who won<br />\na gold medal swimming in<br />\nthe 4(X)-meter relay, was<br />\nkeen on Gard Mallonee, and<br />\nGeorgia<br />\nColeman, a<br />\nvivacious and curly blonde<br />\ndiver, fell hard for Bill<br />\nLogan. I got no farther than<br />\nholding hands with Albina<br />\nOsipowich on the foredeck<br />\nin rough weather. Albina<br />\nhad won the 100-meter<br />\nfreestyle and was a cute girl,<br />\nbut all of these romances last<br />\nonly as long as the<br />\nhomeward voyage.<br />\nTrack and field in the<br />\nOlympic Stadium were spectacular. Our runners were<br /><br />\nfavored but did badly. Betty Robinson won the<br />\n100 meter for women, but<br />\nthe only man to win a flat<br />\nrace was Ray Barbuti, who<br />\ndove headlong to win the<br />\n400 meter. Clarence Hauser,<br />\nwho, with other field men,<br />\nhad watched us practice,<br />\nmuffed two discus throws,<br />\nbut on his last chance set a<br />\nnew Olympic record. Paavo<br />\nNurmi and Willie Ritola of<br />\nFinland and Edwin Wide of<br />\nSweden lapped everyone else<br />\nin the 10,000 meter; Nurmi<br />\nbroke the world record by 18<br />\nseconds\u2014and then picked<br />\nup his sweat clothes and ran<br />\nthe length of the field to the<br />\ndressing room.<br />\nWe were in our dressing<br />\nroom waiting for the<br />\nmarathon to finish when<br />\nthey carried in Joie Ray, the<br />\nChicago cab driver who was<br />\nthe first American to finish,<br />\nin fifth place. He was in a<br />\nstate of collapse and they<br />\nhad to cut the shoes from his<br />\nswollen feet.<br />\nWe were there between the<br />\nhalves of our first game<br />\nagainst Canada and resumed play when the marathon,<br />\nexcept for stragglers, was<br />\nover. We won 6-3 but on the<br />\nfollowing day lost to<br />\nEngland 7-6. Two things<br />\nstick in my memory: An<br />\nEnglish attack man on a solo<br />\nclear came racthg in, tried to<br />\ndodge and lost the ball,<br />\nwhereupon a teammate<br />\nshouted,\"I say, toss it about<br />\na bit, Percival Craig!\"<br />\nWorse than that, we were<br />\ndenied a last-minute tying<br />\ngoal when the goal umpire<br />\nruled that Bill Logan was in<br />\nthe crease. The irony of this<br />\nwas our insistence as a team<br />\nthat there be a crease\u2014not<br />\nwanted by either Canada or<br />\nEngland.<br />\nCanada, having enjoyed a<br />\nday of rest, beat England on<br />\nthe final day 9-5, causing a<br />\ntriple-tie.<br />\nMost of us went down to<br />\nparis on the \"Etoile du<br />\nNord\" and did the kinds of<br />\nthings people do there: the<br />\nOpera, the. Louvre, the<br />\nFolies Bergere, Moulin<br />\nRouge and Casino de Paris,<br />\nnot necessarily in that order.<br />\nWith Lou Nixdorff and Bill<br />\nKegan, I stayed in a pension<br />\non the Sein at 37 Quay de St.<br />\nAugustin.

SI-1.9<br /><br />\nThis country's disastrous attempt at rescuing the hostages<br />\nin Iran confirmed for many the<br />\nimpotence of the American<br />\nmilitary. If the United States<br />\nwasn't able to operate helicopters properly in Iran, how<br />\ncould it possibly compete with<br />\nthe Soviet Union as a superpower? Did the U.S.'s only<br />\nstrength lie in its nuclear<br />\narsenal? Colonel Charlie<br />\nBeckwith, leader of the ill-fated<br />\nrescue attempt, has just written<br />\nhis version of the Iran rescue<br />\nmission, in Delta Force, the<br />\nstory of the development of the<br />\nAmerican military unit charged<br />\nwith combatting international<br />\nterrorism. The book is 300<br />\npages long, two-thirds of which<br />\nare devoted to Beckwith and his<br />\nattempts to promote the Delta<br />\nForce in the Army, and onethird to the development and<br />\nimplementation of the Iranian<br />\nhostage rescue mission.<br />\nBeckwith's discussion, in the<br /><br />\nfirst few chapters, of his experiences with the British<br />\nSpecial Air Services (SAS)<br />\nserves as a backdrop for the rest<br />\nof the book. The SAS had the<br />\ncapability that no force in the<br />\nU.S. had at the time. The U.S.<br />\nmilitary, Beckwith concluded<br />\nfrom his experiences with the<br />\nSAS,\"needed a unit that could<br />\ndo what the SAS could do. It<br />\nneeded to be able to go out in<br />\nsmall patrols and blow up<br />\nbridges and dams and railroad<br />\nlines, to take out an enemy<br />\ncommander, say, like Rommel,<br />\nto collect information for air<br />\nstrikes or for attacks made by<br />\nconventional forces.\" Beckwith<br />\nbecomes a crusader for an<br />\nAmerican SAS. He draws the<br />\nreader through his numerous<br />\nmilitary experiences, from the<br />\nSAS in Malta, to Special Forces<br />\nin Vietnam, to command of the<br />\nArmy Infantry's Florida Ranger<br />\nSchool, back to Vietnam, to<br />\nHawaii, to the Joint Casualty<br />\nResolution Center in Thailand,<br />\nto Commandant of the U.S.<br />\nSpecial Forces School in North<br />\nCarolina, to the development<br />\nof the Delta Force. He is found<br />\npushing throughout these tours<br /><br />\nof duty for an American SAS.<br />\nThis book provides a good<br />\ncase study in intermilitary<br />\nbureaucratic<br />\nstruggles.<br />\nBeckwith fights numerous battles with his immediate<br />\nsuperiors by trying to go over<br />\ntheir heads (when they're not<br />\ncooperative) in pushing for this<br />\nnew American force. He wins<br />\nsome and loses many battles.<br />\nBut his personality (or so he implies) and his persistence finally<br />\ninsure the development of the<br />\nAmerican anti-terrorist group<br />\nwhose mission he defines as:<br />\n\"freeing hostages in buildings<br />\nor in hijacked aircraft, being<br />\nable to operate with low visibility and, if necessary, to dress in<br />\ncivilian clothes or in disguises.\"<br />\nBut already existing special<br />\nforces are firmly resistant to the<br />\ncreation of a new anti-terrorist<br />\ndivision, and oftentimes the<br />\ngoodwill of Beckwith's superiors<br />\nisn't forthcoming, in which case<br />\nhe must find means outside the<br />\nrigid military hierarchy to state<br />\nhis case for this new force.<br />\nBeckwith eventually gets the attention of the Army's Deputy<br />\nChief of Staff, Edward Meyer,<br />\nwho in some sense is the hero<br />\nof this book. It is through<br />\nMeyer's continued attention<br />\nand support that the Delta<br />\nForce finally gets off the<br />\nground.<br />\nColonel Beckwith's encounters with the civilian<br />\nleadership are particularly<br />\nrevealing. We find VicePresident Walter Mondale<br />\nplaying 'with Beckwith's handcuffs during the Iran rescue<br />\nbriefing in the White House.<br />\nWe find Undersecretary of<br />\nState Warren Christopher concerned about the Delta Force<br />\nkilling the Iranian guards at the<br />\nAmerican embassy. And we<br /><br />\nfind Beckwith at his bluntest in<br />\ndiscussing his briefing of the<br />\ncivilian leadership before the<br />\nIran mission when he candidly<br />\npoints out:<br />\nWe were going to kill every guard in the<br />\nfour or five buildings and anyone who<br />\ninterfered in the assault. Any armed<br />\nIranian inside the buildings would be<br />\nkilled. We weren't going to go up and<br />\ncheck their pulses. We would put<br />\nenough copper and lead in them so they<br />\nwouldn't be a problem. When blood<br />\nbegan to flow, a lot of Iranians were going to turn and run for help, and when<br />\nthey did, Delta was prepared to hose<br />\nthem down. No question about it. That<br />\nwas the plan. Furthermore, I did not<br />\nbelieve that the Iranians in the embassy<br />\nwould stand toe to toe and slug it out.<br />\nYes, there would be the odd person who<br />\nwould because of his religion and beliefs<br />\nshoot to the death. We were prepared<br />\nto help him reach his maker.<br /><br />\nBeckwith's candid rhetoric certainly makes for entertaining<br />\nreading.<br />\nThe picture painted of President Carter is highly complimentary. Carter apparently<br />\ninstructs Beckwith to tell his<br />\nmen that if the mission fails, it<br />\nis his fault, not theirs. And<br />\nwhen the Force returns after the<br />\nfailed attempt, he remarks<br />\n(after having spent a few<br />\nminutes with each survivor of<br />\nthe mission): \"I have been<br />\nremiss in not knowing more<br />\nabout Delta Force. I am very<br />\nimpressed with what I've<br />\nlearned about them and what<br />\nI've seen today. I didn't know<br />\nwe still had people like this who<br />\nwould sacrifice everything for<br />\ntheir country. Colonel Beckwith, I am very proud of these<br />\nmen.\"<br />\nThe mission's failure was<br />\nclearly due to technical failures<br />\nin the Iranian desert (Beckwith<br />\nremarks that it is appalling that<br />\nthe helicopters didn't fly with<br />\nmechanics who would be able<br /><br />\nto repair them in the event of<br />\ntechnical<br />\ndifficulties).<br />\nBeckwith, in responding to<br />\nSenator Sam Nunn of the<br />\nSenate Armed Services Committee, contends that what he<br />\nlearned from the mission was<br />\nthat: \"...Murphy is alive and<br />\nwell. He's in every drawer,<br />\nunder every rock and on top of<br />\nevery hill.\" The mission's<br />\nfailure, he claims, was due to<br />\n\"purely bad luck.\"<br />\nThe major downfall of this<br />\nbook is its excessively long<br />\ndiscussion of the Force's origins<br />\nand the all too brief discussion<br />\nof the Iranian rescue mission.<br />\nThe preface introduces the<br />\nreader to the White House's<br />\nrole in the mission and leaves<br />\nthe reader with a feeling of<br />\nsuspense and excitement. But<br />\nthe reader is forced to wait for<br />\nanother 200 pages td go by<br />\nbefore he is rewarded with a<br />\ndiscussion of Iran. By this time<br />\nhe has lost most of his interest<br />\nin the subject. If the rescue mission had been a grand success,<br />\nthen the reader would have<br />\nbeen more interested in how<br />\nthis American force came into<br />\nbeing and what factors contributed to its success. Since the<br />\nostensible reason for considering this book is what it has to<br />\nsay about the Iran rescue mission, it leaves the reader with<br />\ngreat disappointment\u2014most of<br />\nthe book has nothing to do with<br />\nthat mission.

Under<br />\nexisting policy, when a Hopkins<br />\nresearcher applies for funding<br />\nfrom various sources, he must<br />\nraise the money for the project<br />\nplus an additional 59 percent.<br />\nThe extra 59 percent constitutes<br />\nwhat is called the indirect costs<br />\nof the experiment.<br />\nIndirect costs are levied by<br />\nthe University to pay for<br />\nutilities, research libraries,<br />\nadministrative staffs, and<br />\nvarious other back-up services<br />\nnecessary for effective research.<br />\nAccording to Green, \"In all<br />\nfairness, there are certain costs<br />\nthat the University must charge<br />\nresearchers, but we question<br />\nwhether indirect costs as they<br />\nstand now should be so high.\"<br />\nSince 1966, when indirect<br />\ncosts as they are known today<br />\nfirst came into being, they have<br />\nbeen consuming an ever in-<br /><br />\nDr. Robert (;reen<br /><br />\ncreasing fraction of the funds<br />\navailable for research.

According to<br />\nGreen, \"This summer, Dean<br />\nKrueger gave an explanation,<br />\nbut it was far from detailed.<br />\nThis is a great matter of concern for myself and the other<br />\nfaculty. We have a right to<br />\nknow what it is for.\"<br />\nIn order to effectively support research, Green proposes<br />\nthat the administration and<br />\nfaculty work more closely<br />\ntogether as a \"two-pronged<br />\nsword\" in an effort to<br />\ndistribute more equitably the<br />\nlimited funds going to research.<br />\nAs a first step Green suggests,\"What is needed is an explanation of where the indirect<br />\ncosts of research are going.\"<br />\nOnce such information is made<br />\navailable, faculty members will<br />\nbe able to make suggestions<br />\nthat might decrease the indirect<br /><br />\ncosts and leave more money at<br />\nthe disposal of the researcher.<br />\nIn addition to grappling with<br />\nthe difficulties of ascertaining<br />\nan itemized account of where<br />\nthe funds from indirect costs<br />\nare going, Green says that the<br />\ncommittee will likely suggest<br />\ntwo long-range solutions to the<br />\nproblem of financing research.<br />\nInitially, the committee intends to encourage faculty<br />\nmembers to raise more money<br />\nfor research possibly by proposing a system of awards for<br />\nfund raising. The committee<br />\nalso intends to encourage a<br />\ndecrease in the indirect costs the<br />\nUniversity demands for research<br />\nwork.<br />\nFor the immediate future,<br />\nGreen says the committee will<br />\nbe collecting information until<br />\nabout Christmas.

He looked<br />\nanything but Russian; his Lee<br />\njeans, white T-shirt, Adidas<br />\ntennis shoes, and backpack<br />\nreminded me of a typical<br />\nAmerican university student.<br />\nWhen he began to speak,<br />\napologizing for the interruption, I noticed that his English<br />\nwas smooth and virtually accetitless. A thought flashed<br />\nthrough my mind: Could it be<br />\nthat, after only a week in the<br />\nSoviet Union, I had stumbled<br />\nacross another American, and<br />\na college student at that? When<br />\nI incredulously asked him if he<br />\nwas American, he laughed; no,<br />\nhe was a student at the University of Leningrad. His name<br />\nwas Valery. I complimented<br />\nValery on his English, and we<br />\nchatted a little about my stay in<br />\nthe Soviet Union. He was<br />\nespecially delighted to find out<br />\nthat I was an American.<br />\nThen he suddenly shifted the<br />\nconversation to the area of his<br />\ntrue concern. Was I, by any<br />\nchance, interested in trading or<br />\nselling something I had with<br />\nme? He would pay me well for<br />\nmy shoes, my shirt, my corduroy pants, or my backpack.<br />\nOr perhaps I had something in<br />\nmy hotel room that he was<br />\nlooking for: American tapes<br />\nand records, jeans, magazines,<br />\nsweaters, and so on. If I did not<br />\nwant cash\u2014he and I both knew<br />\nthe risks of carrying large<br />\namounts of money out of the<br />\ncountry\u2014I could trade my<br />\ngoods for some of his own<br />\nitems; he offered me Russian<br />\nflags, a soldier's uniform, dolls,<br />\ncommemorative<br />\nposters,<br />\npins...And the list went on.<br />\nScenes like this one recurred<br />\ncountless times during my trip<br />\nto the Soviet Union. I was there<br />\non a program, organized by the<br />\nUniversity of New Hampshire,<br />\nthat takes fifty college-age<br />\nLeningrad,<br />\nstudents to<br />\nMoscow, and Tallin.

The actors<br />\nrarely leave this room, so that<br />\nthe play is set unusually far<br />\nback on the stage. This distance<br />\nfrom the audience, while at first<br />\ndistracting, emphasizes that this<br />\nis, as Williams called it, a play<br />\nof memory. Viewed through<br />\nthe lens of time and space, the<br />\nactions are at once isolated and<br />\nmade smaller, as if the audience, too, is recalling these<br />\nevents rather than viewing them<br />\nfor the first time. Against this<br />\nsetting, the astonishing cast<br />\nenacts the small tragedy of the<br />\nWingfield family and their<br />\ngentleman caller perhaps as well<br />\nas it has ever been played.<br />\nThe production stars Jessica<br />\nTandy, Amanda Plummer, and<br />\nBruce Davison as the<br />\nWingfields and John Heard as<br />\nthe gentleman caller. The extraordinary Miss Tandy dominates the first act and the opening of the second; alternately<br />\nshrill, nostalgic, bitter, and<br />\nbrave, she evokes the complex<br />\ncharacter of the mother<br />\nremarkably. At her most<br />\nbrutally manipulative, she is<br />\nterrifying; reminiscing about an<br />\nafternoon in her youth when<br />\nseventeen<br />\nshe<br />\nreceived<br />\ngentleman callers, she is wistful<br />\nand moving. When, in the second act, she dances with an<br />\narmload of jonquils recalling<br />\nhow she once conquered the<br />\ncotillion, the audience burst into applause. It is hardly<br />\nnecessary to mention Miss Tandy's status on the American<br />\nstage; she is one of the few living actresses about whom one<br />\ncould tell one's children, proudly, \"I saw her act.\"<br /><br />\nAmanda Plummer, who<br />\nplays the crippled and cripplingly shy daughter, may attain<br />\nthat status as well if she continues her phenomenal career.<br />\nShe is superb as Laura<br />\nWingfield; her enormously<br />\nphysical acting made the halting<br />\nand withdrawn daughter utterly true. During the second act,<br />\nher awkward blossoming was<br />\nevoked by a palpable loosening<br />\nof Plummer's tense, constrained body; then, at her final rejection, she seemed to actually<br />\nphysically retract into herself.<br />\nPlummer is compelling, even in<br />\nscenes where she has no lines;<br />\nher dreamy presence is enough<br />\nto remind the audience of the<br />\ntension between the three family members.<br />\nTom Wingfield, the angry<br />\npoet, is also brilliantly acted by<br />\nBruce Davison. Though<br />\nDavison seemed stiff at first, he<br />\nwarmed up rapidly and eventually nearly stole the play from<br />\nPlummer and Tandy. While his<br />\naccent wavered alarmingly<br />\nfrom a perceptible drawl to<br />\nsomething that was far from<br />\nSouthern, he was commanding<br />\nand convincing all the same.<br />\nHis scenes with Plummer, in<br />\nparticular, were filled with a<br />\nkind of edgy, almost manic<br />\ntenderness; his final soliloquy,<br />\nagainst the candle-lit still life of<br />\nhis mother and sister, was<br />\nastonishing.<br />\nJohn Heard, another<br />\ntalented actor, was disappoin.ting here. In his long scene with<br />\nLaura, the necessary tension<br />\nwas lacking; he plays the lovemaking a bit too earnestly, not<br />\nbluffly enough to prepare the<br />\naudience for his final betrayal<br />\nof the Wingfields' dreams. He<br />\nmoved through the scene nearly as awkwardly as Laura, when<br />\none wanted a looser, more<br />\ncomfortable, arm-swinging Jim<br />\nto play off the physical and<br /><br />\nThe cast of GIss Menagerie<br /><br />\nmental restraints that trap the proper response of a gentleLaura.

Whenever Pryor<br />\nthinks the audience might have<br />\nheard enough of his vomit<br />\nnoises(and his timing for such<br /><br />\nthings is enormously slow) he<br />\nswitches to more chancy<br />\nmaterials like \"dick jokes.\" His<br />\nidea of a smooth transition is to<br />\njump up off the stage floor<br />\nwhere he has just collapsed and<br />\nsay,\"When I was twenty, I used to fuck all day.\" After a few<br />\nmore minutes of stupid sex<br />\njokes, he starts all over again<br />\nwith vomit noises.<br />\nFor two hours.<br />\nThe most depressing thing<br />\nabout seeing this movie (other<br />\nthan thinking about the two<br />\ndollars you paid to get in) is the<br />\nfact that a lot of people are<br />\nlaughing.

During these<br />\nyears, there has been a high<br />\nturnover rate of students. There<br />\nare usually twenty-five to forty<br />\nnew students at the beginning<br />\nof each semester; however, as<br />\nthe semester continues, the<br />\nenrollment declines due to increasing amounts of school<br />\nwork and other commitments.<br />\nThis decline is unfortunate<br />\nbecause it takes more than a<br />\ncouple of months to even<br />\ndiscover what karate is all<br />\nabout. I have been a member of<br />\nthe club since the second<br />\nsemester of my freshman year,<br />\nand I have begun to gain some<br />\ninsight in the nature of<br />\nkarate-do.<br />\nMany people, including myself, before my training began,<br />\nthink of karate as just a physical art. Misguided views of<br />\nkarate and other martial arts<br />\nare produced by movies which<br />\ndepict karate as a mystical art<br />\nthat enables a person to chop<br />\ntrees with his bare hands, to<br />\ndefeat a whole legion without<br />\nbreaking a sweat, and to jump<br />\nin the air and remain there long<br />\nenough to read the Sunday New<br />\nYork Times. However, a person practicing karate for a year<br />\nwill discover that karate includes both physical and mental aspects. As a form of exercise, karate is ideal. Firstly,<br />\nkarate exercises the mind and<br />\nbody. Secondly, one can practice karate for a whole lifetime.<br />\nFinally, men, women, and chil-<br /><br />\ndren of all ages can practice<br />\nkarate.<br />\nIn terms of physical development, the numerous karate<br />\ntechniques utilize a major portion of the body muscles.<br />\nThrough daily practicing, one<br />\nslowly develops strength and<br />\ncontrol in one's muscles. The<br />\nkarateka (karate student) does<br />\nnot need to develop excessive<br />\nstrength or bulk to be effective.<br />\nInstead, he relies on timing, the<br />\nrapid contraction and relaxation of muscles, and speed to<br />\nmake his techniques effective.<br />\nA good example ot this occurred at one of the intercollegiate tournaments last<br />\nyear. Hiroyoshi Okazaki from<br />\nTemple University was matched<br />\nagainst a Drexel University student in free sparring. Okazaki<br />\nis 5'2\" and weighs about 115<br />\nlbs. His opponent was,6'4\" and<br />\nweighed at least 190 lbs. The<br />\nmatch started slowly, but after<br />\na few minutes, Okazaki simply<br />\noverwhelmed his opponent with<br />\ndouble front kicks and forward<br />\npunches. Okazaki's abilities in<br />\nkarate are similar to Wayne<br />\nGretzky's abilities in ice<br />\nhockey. Both men are small<br />\ncompared to their opponents,<br />\nbut they are able to dominate<br />\ntheir opponents through finesse, superior ability developed<br />\nfrom years of practice, and<br />\nstrong fighting spirit.<br />\nIn terms of mental development, karate is a great discipline builder. This happens as<br />\none pushes himself to perform<br />\ntechniques over and over again.<br />\nAnother mental aspect is that a<br />\nkarateka must always imagine<br /><br />\nan opponent when he practices<br />\ntechniques. One can practice a<br />\ntechnique a million times, but<br />\nthe practice will be a total waste<br />\nof time unless he imagines an<br />\nopponent. Karate also prepares<br />\na person to handle stressful<br />\nsituations. When a karateka<br />\nbegins free sparring, he must<br />\ncalm his mind and spirit. The<br />\nslightest bit of fear will cause<br />\ntunnel vision or momentary paralysis when the opponent attacks. Tunnel vision occurs<br />\nwhen the karateka's fear of the<br />\nopponent causes his eye to<br />\nfocus only on any slight movements made by his opponent.<br />\nThis tunnel vision causes the<br />\nkarateka to lose sight of the<br />\nwhole opponent; thus, the<br />\nkarateka is easily defeated. To<br />\novercome this tunnel vision, the<br />\nkarateka must realize that his<br />\nfear does not emanate from his<br />\nopponent but from his own<br />\nmind. Once the karateka controls his fear, he will be better<br />\nable to handle his opponent.<br />\nThis control of one's emotions<br />\nin facing an opponent can be<br />\napplied to everyday problems.<br />\nOne needs to have a clear and<br />\nalert mind without hindrance<br />\nfrom emotions to deal with<br />\nproblems correctly and<br />\neffectively.<br />\nThe mental and physical aspects of karate are embodied in<br />\nkata. Kata is a set of choreographed moves in which a karateka fights imaginary opponents. When a karateka practices kata, he can imagine his<br />\nopponents to have different<br />\nsizes, speed, and ability. Thus<br />\nthe karateka fights imaginary<br /><br />\nopponents. And this imagination becomes a deadly<br />\ndance. From a physical standpoint, kata has fast moves<br />\nwhich develop efficient contraction and relaxation of muscles<br />\nand slow moves which develop<br />\nmuscles isometrically. Also,<br />\nproper breathing technique is<br />\ndeveloped in, kata.<br />\nThe mental and physical'aspects of karate are geared<br />\ntoward one goal. No, karate<br />\nwas not developed to enable<br />\none person to beat the brains<br />\nout of another person. Master<br />\nGichin Funakoshi, the founder<br />\nof Shotokan karate, asserted<br /><br />\nthat, \"The ultimate aim of the<br />\nart of karate lies not in victory.<br />\nor defeat but in the perfection<br />\nof the character of its participants.\"<br />\nIn conclusion, I would like to<br />\nsay that it is still possible to<br />\njoin any of the four martial arts<br />\nclubs.<br />\nAikido club: Mon, Wed<br />\n6:30-8:00 Wrestling Room<br />\nJHU Karate Club (Shotokan<br />\nKarate): Tues,Thurs 8:00-930<br />\nWrestling Room<br />\nJudo Club: Mon, Wed<br />\n8:00-9:30 Wrestling Room<br />\nTae Kwan do: Wed 6:30-8:00<br />\nSat 11:00-12:00 a.m.<br /><br />\nSize is not necessary to star in karate.<br /><br />\n18/NOVEMBER 11, 1983<br /><br />\nBlue Jay Harriers Place Twentieth In MAC's<br />\nby Vivek Samnotra<br />\nThe harriers ran their hardest<br />\nrace of the season at MAC's<br />\nand broke into the MAC top<br />\ntwenty at Indian Gap, Pennsylvania.
