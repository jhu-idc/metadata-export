I'd like to take this<br />\nopportunity to say that I couldn't<br />\nhave done it without all of you<br />\nfaithful readers showing your<br />\nlove by sticking your faces into<br />\nmy column every week. Of<br />\ncourse, none of you ever sent me<br />\nany money, so I'm not all that<br />\ngrateful. But I never really expected that. I quote one of my<br />\nmentors, Dave Barry, who wrote:<br />\n\"The best that you can hope for,<br />\nwith a newspaper column, is that<br />\npeople will like it enough to attach it to their refrigerators with<br />\nmagnets shaped like fruit.\"<br />\nBut the point is, this is my last<br />\nchance to affect the lives of you,<br />\nthe home viewers, my last chance<br />\nto make a point about stupid<br />\nthings in the world, my last<br />\nchance to make you fall to the<br />\nground with utterly spleen<br />\nrupturing humor.<br />\nOn this magnificent occasion I<br />\nlook back to even before my own<br />\nhumble beginnings at this esteemed institution. I look to nly<br />\napplication to this school, to the<br />\nessay that I thought got me in<br />\nthere. I have that essay sitting<br />\nright here in front of me.<br />\nIt's really had. I feel like I'm<br />\nat home with my friends and my<br />\nmother has just pulled out that<br />\ncard that I made for her in first<br />\ngrade out of paste and just enough<br />\nconstruction paper for me to<br />\ncover up completely with the<br />\namount of paste I had. The card<br />\nwith the poem on the inside written in crayon with all the r's and<br />\ns's written backwards that I<br />\nthought was so good because I<br />\nrhymed \"blue\" with \"you\" and<br />\n\"love \u2014 with \"mommy.\"<br />\nBut the point is, the application<br />\nasked us applicants to make up<br />\nour own question and answer it.<br />\nBeing as creative as I am, I<br />\nmulled this over for days before<br />\nI creatively stole a question from<br />\nthe Boston University application: \"You have been asked to<br />\nspeak at your graduation. Write<br />\na speech<br />\n<br />\n, The reasoning behind my<br />\nchoosing this particular question<br />\nis that then, as now, I knew I was<br />\nnot going to really be asked to<br />\nspeak at my graduation, being as<br />\nI was neither valedictorian nor<br />\nsalutatorian of myu class (I was<br />\nonly third in my class, which<br />\nmeant I was given the privilege<br />\nof standing up when my name<br />\nwas called out for \"Honorable<br />\nMention\u2014Foreign Language<br />\nAward\"). And then, as now, I<br />\nfigured that there would be an<br />\nassortment of really boring<br />\nspeakers at my graduation,<br />\namong them the valedictorian and<br />\nsalutatorian of my class, both colossally unhip and unfunny individuals. I dreaded the cliched<br />\nspeeches of \"we're the best this<br />\nschool has ever seen,\" and \"we<br />\nall have bright futures to look forward to,\" and \"we may forget<br />\nthe hard times, but we'll never<br />\nforget the friends we made.\" I<br />\nwas mostly right. I only missed<br />\none: \"Our teachers have given so<br />\nmuch, most of which we don't<br />\nrealize<br />\nyet'<br />\n(the<br />\neven<br />\nsalutatorian, I had forgotten, was<br />\nan unbelievable suck-up.<br />\nNow, of course, I only hope<br />\nthat you will all clip me out and<br />\nstick me to your refrigerators until three weeks from now when<br />\nyou move away from them.<br />\nAnyway, here's the speech:<br />\n\"I'd like to thank Lou for that<br />\nstunning, even overwhelming introduction. I know you're all anxious to hear Mr. Trudeau speak,<br />\nbeing as we're paying him to be<br />\nfunny, and I know the only<br />\nreason I'm up here is because this<br />\nis my imagination, so I'll keep<br />\nthis short.

This should<br />\ntake about ninety seconds, shortly<br />\nafter which we can get the hell out<br />\nof here.<br />\n\"First of all, there is no such<br />\nthing as 'sure.' There is always<br />\na margin of uncertainty in any action, thought, or series of actions<br />\nor thoughts. And no matter how<br />\nSee PUNCH. 6<br />\n<br />\nA primer for Richardson<br />\nA growing faculty discontent with the University's apparent<br />\ndirection has become more tangible this semester. One visible<br />\nsign of unhappy academics is the pending departure of most<br />\nof the French department. Ominous noises can be heard in other<br />\nareas of the Arts and Sciences. As students committed to the<br />\nUniversity, we find the atmosphere at Homewood alarming.<br />\nWhile the size of the Homewood faculty is expected to fall by<br />\nsome seven and a half percent over the next several years. the<br />\nadministration is due to grow by ten percent. This disparity<br />\nis largely responsible for the faculty's feeling of relative<br />\nunimportance.<br />\nJohns Hopkins should be the 'hottest' school on the East Coast<br />\namong undergraduates, graduates, and faculty. It is not. Conversations with many members of the Arts and Sciences faculty reveal a sense of alienation from their University which is<br />\nfrightening. To change this, and to continue to attract faculty<br />\nand students of a caliber to which Hopkins aspires, we offer<br />\nthe following suggestions to president --elect Richardson:<br />\nI. Abandon the arbitrary Five Year Plan and devise a scheme<br />\nto bring sustainable finances to the Arts and Sciences. Faculty<br />\nand student involvement should be central to such an undertaking, not marginalized as it was by Muller. Lombardi et al.<br />\nMost important from an undergraduate perspective, we need<br />\nto reduce undergraduate enrollment such that all departments<br />\ncan feasibly mandate senior theses, if appropriate A smaller<br />\nstudent body would also make it possible for the faculty to offer seminar size (15 students) classes again for the majority of<br />\nupper-level course offering. Such classes are the historical<br />\nessence of a Hopkins undergraduate education. There were approximately 600 undergraduates per class here in the 1970's,<br />\nbefore the Administration began to look upon us as walking,<br />\ntalking revenue. We should return to this size. Such a move<br />\nis also advocated by a significant proportion of the faculty.<br />\n2. Provide the professors with adequate support staff so that<br />\nthey will not shrink from teaching undergraduates. If a pro-<br />\n<br />\nfessor is forced to make a choice between doing the busywork<br />\nfor an important paper, which he or she is pressured by the<br />\nAdministration to publish, and carefully planning and grading<br />\nan undergraduate class, in which he or she is pressured to maximize enrollment, there is little doubt as to which will suffer.<br />\nTeaching will not advance anyone's career, as Dr. David was<br />\nSO ignominiously informed last year. More support staff would<br />\nmake it a pleasure fOr the faculty to teach, rather than a trial.<br />\n3. Slash the size of the Administration. The current organization's ineffectiveness has been manifested in countless ways.<br />\nincluding the descent of Arts and Sciences into deficit. Hundreds of American corporations have found themselves liberated<br />\nafter firing superfluous mid-level management. There is no<br />\nreason that this should not be the case here: hand the University back to the faculty, with whom the Administration should<br />\nhe in league, not oppostion. If we don't, it is only a matter of<br />\ntime until other departments follow the French Department's<br />\nexample.<br />\n4. Articulate a mission for the School of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nThe School is profoundly lacking a meaningful identity around<br />\nwhich students and faculty can rally. Delve into the University's past, and unearth a historical continuity which is something<br />\nmore substantial than platitudes to \"excellence in education.\"<br />\nEssentially, decide why we are all here.<br />\nHopkins is a unique place with a great deal going for it,<br />\nacademically and professionally. Yet the Muller Administration became extremely distant from the University's academic<br />\nessence. Over time, the indifference this distance bred came<br />\nto undermine the faculty and the School of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nThe alienation and lack of unity which now characterize much<br />\nof faculty and student life here are just two of the consequences.<br />\nThe first thing that the Richardson administration must do is<br />\nend this estrangement. It must do so immediately, decisively,<br />\nand publicly. Otherwise, as the French department's departure<br />\nhas shown, the consequences may be dreadful.<br />\n<br />\nCiao, babes. We're gone<br />\nIt's Thursday night and the final issue of the News-Letter is<br />\nbeing put to bed here at the Gatehouse. After twenty-three<br />\nsleepless Thursday nights we find it hard to believe the ordeal<br />\nis over for this academic year. But, alas, it is, and, as has been<br />\na tradition when the editors-in-chief take their final bows, we<br />\nwould like to take a look back over the year and find a few<br />\nparticularly poignant moments when we actually tackled some<br />\ndifficult issues.<br />\nThe top five stori\u00e7 of th,e yeiir.,folilow. As ,tiard, as it, may<br />\nbe to believe, the cartoon debates were not the sole foci of our<br />\npaper. So much has happened at Hopkins during this past year<br />\nthat it is difficult to narrow the field, but here goes:<br />\nI. Steven Muller departed the nerd-like atmosphere of<br />\nHopkins after 18 years of service: \"I do want to write a<br />\nbook,...but obviously, I'm not engaged in raising money as<br />\na tribute to me; other people are doing that .......--Muller,<br />\nin N-L interview, 2/2/90.<br />\n2. Richardson appointed as new president: \"He's the kind of<br />\nguy who would like to hold hands with everybody\"----a Hopkins<br />\nprofessor. \"He's not Mr. Dynanism, hut after a while he grows<br />\non you\"\u2014Lou Giangiulio.

The launch of the Hubble Space Telescope: \"As late as<br />\nnine minutes before the scheduled takeoff,...a group of Space<br />\nTelescope Science Institute staff had started eating Crackerjacks.\"\u2014Science, 4/1 3/90. The Challenger catastrophe was attributed by some NASA technicians to the fact that, for the first<br />\nand only time, they were not eating Crackerjacks during that<br />\nlaunch.<br />\n.<br />\n4. The announcement of extensive housing renovations:<br />\n\"We're looking at that whole area as a piece of the campus<br />\nwhich happens to be across Charles Street...We want to get<br />\nthe psychological barrier out of people's minds...When you go<br />\nacross Charles Street, you're not in some Twilight Zone'<br />\nChris Colombo, Dean of Homewood Schools Services, 2/2/90.<br />\n5.

I believe<br />\nthat the University should do<br />\nmore to inform and protect its<br />\nstudents and its employees,<br />\nbefore more incidents occur.<br />\nAfter reading of crime reported<br />\nin last week's News-Letter, I contacted Baltimore City Police and<br />\nwas told some disturbing facts<br />\nabout an increase in crime citywide. Compared to the first<br />\nquarter last year:<br />\n*Larceny up 18.9% (number<br />\nof incidents 7304 to 8681)<br />\n*Burglary up 13.9% (3048 to<br />\n3471)<br />\n*Aggravated Assault up 24.6%<br />\n(1498 to 1867)<br />\n*Automobile Theft up 40.0(X<br />\n(1729 to 2420)<br />\n*Murder up 25.5% (55 to 69)<br />\n*Rape up 32.7% (113 to 150)<br />\n*Robbery up 27.6% (1803 to<br />\n2301)<br />\nOverall, the crime index is up<br />\n21.9% for January. February,<br />\nand March, for felony crimes. 1<br />\nwas also told that this was not an<br />\nunusual increase in crime for an<br />\nEastern Seaboard city. Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain<br />\nstatistics for crime in the immediate JHU area. hut I feel that<br />\n<br />\nit is important for all students to<br />\nbecome aware of the frequency<br />\nof crimes in and around the campus. Only then can informed<br />\nstudents act accordingly. To the<br />\ncredit of Hopkins security,<br />\nbulletins are issued now when<br />\nthere is a major incident, or an<br />\nincident involving a member of<br />\nthe Hopkins community, but this<br />\nis not enough to inform the<br />\nstudents of the full scope of<br />\ndanger.<br />\nA source at the northern district<br />\ninformed me that on the same<br />\nnight (Thursday, April 19)of the<br />\narmed robbely assault on a<br />\nHopkins woman there were two<br />\n<br />\nother armed robberies in the<br />\nvicinity that we were not informed about. There was an arrest<br />\nmade in one incident, but the<br />\npolice say there was no reason to<br />\nbelieve that the crimes were connected. One of the incidents took<br />\nplace at 28th and Guilford, the<br />\nother on Art Museum Drive. I<br />\nbelieve it is incumbent upon<br />\nHopkins officials to start informing people about these and other<br />\nincidents so that people (especially students) do not find<br />\nthemselves lulled into a false<br />\nsense of security as the streets<br />\nbecome more and more unsafe.<br />\nI believe that Hopkins should take<br />\n<br />\nthe next logical step in protecting<br />\nits students and strongly encourage all students to attend selfdefense workshops, provided by<br />\nthe University. The purpose of<br />\nthese workshops might be multifold, including education and<br />\npractical defense measures. The<br />\nUniversity needs to take more<br />\nsteps in evidencing their concern<br />\nabout safety. Both men and<br />\nwomen need to be prepared with<br />\nmore than a rape whistle.<br />\nAlthough the Hopkins security force does advocate following<br />\nguidelines,<br />\nprecautionary<br />\nSee LETTERS, 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\nSpeaker's Corner<br />\n<br />\nE -Level<br />\n<br />\nStephen Schwartz<br />\n<br />\nby Kathy Korbuly<br />\n<br />\nfrom the French Department<br />\nLike most graduate students in<br />\nArts and Sciences, I've known<br />\nabout the impending decimation<br />\nof the French Department for<br />\nseveral months now. It has thus<br />\nbeen rather distressing for me to<br />\nopen the News-Letter every week<br />\nand find a seemingly endless<br />\nparade of articles and letters concerning the worthy topics of Fiji<br />\nIslanders, Spring Fairs, sexist<br />\ncartoons, and the like, with nary<br />\na word about the demise of the<br />\nFrench Department. 1 was quite<br />\nsurprised when a front-page article finally \"broke\" the news on<br />\nApril 20.<br />\nUnfortunately, the author of the<br />\narticle in question couldn't be<br />\nbothered to actually investigate<br />\nthe story (too much French<br />\nhomework, no doubt) and the<br />\nresulting report apparently relies<br />\nentirely on information gleaned<br />\nfrom the department secretary,<br />\nKitty Letsch. Although a reporter<br />\nmight correctly expect the departmental secretary to be a useful<br />\nsource, to rely entirely on any<br />\nsingle version of the facts is irresponsible to say the least. The<br />\nresulting puff-piece should serve<br />\nto reassure those students who<br />\nhad heard the rumors and feared<br />\nthe worst: don't worry, \"the<br />\ndepartment is still here.\" One<br />\nquestion that should have been<br />\nasked, or should have been asked more insistently and of a<br />\ngreater number of people, is:<br />\nwhat sort of department is it that<br />\nis \"still here\"? The students at<br />\nHopkins deserve a more accurate<br />\nanswer to this question than that<br />\nprovided in the article.<br />\nI am currently a second-year<br />\n<br />\ngraduate student in the French<br />\nDepartment and here are some of<br />\nthe facts as I understand them:<br />\nThree out of the five current<br />\nprofessors are leaving Hopkins<br />\nfor Emory University: Professors<br />\nVincent Descombes, Suzanne<br />\nGuerlac, and Josue Harari who,<br />\nuntil recently, was the department<br />\nchair. If one takes into account<br />\nthat the department lost a professor last year who was not<br />\nreplaced (due, as far as 1 can tell,<br />\nto the austerity budget imposed<br />\nunder the Five-Year Plan\u2014it was<br />\napparently the administration's<br />\nshort-sighted refusal to allow for<br />\na replacement that precipitated<br />\nthe departure of Descombes,<br />\nGuerlac and Harari), the professorial corps for 1990-91 will<br />\nbe at 33 percent of its size in<br />\n1988-89. Contrary to what was<br />\nwritten in the article, Laurence<br />\nSelim, though delightful and a<br />\nsuperb teacher (or so I'm told),<br />\nis not a professor. Since the fortunes of most graduate students<br />\nare (for better or for worse) inextricably linked to those of their<br />\nprospective or actual thesis advisors, one result of this professorial exodus is that of the 20<br />\ncurrent graduate students in<br />\nFrench, by my count 10 are accepting offers at Emory, 2 are going to other graduate schools, 1<br />\nis talking time off to think things<br />\nover, 1 got a job, and 6 are staying. It is at best misleading to say<br />\nthat \"most graduate students will<br />\nstudy at a university in France<br />\nnext year.\" Most of the graduate<br />\nstudents are leaving for good. Of<br />\nthose who are staying, most if not<br />\nall will be in France next year and<br />\n<br />\nit will be difficult, though not impossible, for the department to attract new graduate students in the<br />\ncurrent situation.<br />\nSo where does that leave the<br />\nFrench Department? The author<br />\nof the article did have the<br />\nperspicacity to open a course<br />\ncatalogue. He was dismayed by<br />\nthe dearth of upper level courses.<br />\nAnd well he should be. But he<br />\nshould also have asked himself<br />\nwho is going to teach 7 sections<br />\nof \"French Elements,\" 8 sections of \"Intermediate French,\"<br />\n3 sections of \"Advanced Intermediate French,\" 5 sections of<br />\n\"Conversation et Composition,\"<br />\nand 1 section of \"French for<br />\nReading and Translation.\" In the<br />\npast, those courses have been<br />\ntaught almost exclusively by<br />\ngraduate students and Laurence<br />\nSelim. As of right now, there are<br />\nno teaching assistants in French<br />\nother than the graduate students.<br />\nI'm sure the administration has a<br />\nplan. It'd be nice to know what<br />\nit is.<br />\nIt might seem that a university<br />\nwith Hopkins' prestige would<br />\nhave little trouble hiring new professors. Unfortunately, it's not<br />\nthat simple. First of all, the (artificial, to my mind) budget crisis<br />\nwhich precipitated the problem<br />\nhas in no way abated, and this is<br />\ncommon knowledge among<br />\nacademicians.

The tiniest bones in<br />\nyour body are inside your ears,<br />\nyou know\u2014and your sense of<br />\nbalance, too. If you mess around<br />\nwith your ears, you could not only become deaf, but you could<br />\nstart falling down all the time.'<br />\n\u2014If you start to take something<br />\ncompletely seriously, it means<br />\nyou're losing.' The corollary to<br />\nthis rule is 'If all else fails, tell<br />\na joke.' Telling a joke is like a<br />\n<br />\nsystems check for humans; it<br />\nmeans that our memory is still intact, it restores nervous energy<br />\nand waning fight reflexes (there's<br />\nnothing a person fights so hard to<br />\nget as a laugh), and it's a taste<br />\ncheck. That is, provided you<br />\nknow whether or not to laugh. If<br />\nyou don't know if a joke is funny, you probably have already<br />\nstarted wearing print ties on plaid<br />\nsuits.<br />\n\"Recently, I have learned,<br />\nresearchers have unearthed what<br />\nappears to be the missing<br />\nbeatitude. Translated from an ancient scroll, it reads, 'Blessed are<br />\nthose who are involved in a relationship in which both people feel<br />\ncompletely comfortable with the<br />\nparameters they have set and<br />\nwhich their friends do not find<br />\nunhealthy for one of the involved members, for one set of<br />\nparents shall hate the other family entirely.' I think this means<br />\nsomething.<br />\n<br />\n\"Never drink orange juice just<br />\nafter you've brushed your teeth.<br />\n\"And lastly, I offer you what I<br />\nconsider the top four of my 'Good<br />\nIdeas in General.'

Two, Where Possible, Plead Ignorance and Apathy<br />\nEven If You Know Better\u2014you'll<br />\nstay out of trouble. Three, Never<br />\nSacrifice Comfort for Fashion,<br />\nfor you'll always look better and<br />\nfeel happier if you are comfortable. Four, Never Sacrifice<br />\nFashion for Comfort, for you can<br />\nnever be happy with yourself<br />\nunless you look good to yourself,<br />\nand besides, you should appear<br />\nsocially circumspect at all times.<br />\n\"That is the completest list of<br />\neverything that I am 'sure' of<br />\napart from the fact that I am not<br />\nsure of anything and I wish I<br />\ncould stop thinking about it.

Consumerism tells that in<br />\norder to be whole people, fulfilled and content, we need to fortify ourselves again and again<br />\nwith purchased products. We are<br />\npart of a culture that consumes<br />\nand wastes endlessly, and the<br />\npsychological, social, and environmental effects have not gone<br />\nunnoticed. In addition, advertising commonly promotes sexism,<br />\nracism, and the perpetuation of<br />\nstereotypes.<br />\nOur school should be very<br />\ncareful in its support of<br />\nideologies. The display ads are<br />\ndangerous not only for the consumerist ideology that they<br />\nuphold, but also because this very<br />\n(insidious) agenda is disguised by<br />\nvisual appeal.<br />\nWe feel that the administrators<br />\nresponsible have not given this<br />\nissue adequate consideration. At<br />\na time when so much is going on<br />\nfor students and administrators<br />\nwho respond to their needs, it is<br />\neasy to overlook such seemingly<br />\nbenign objects as these two<br />\ndisplay boards.

Response to the<br />\nStudents for Environmental Action's efforts to bring about<br />\nrecycling has been outstanding.<br />\nThe success of the campus-wide<br />\naluminum-recycling program<br />\n(which now brings in over 200<br />\npounds of aluminum weekly) and<br />\nthe tremendous volume of glass,<br />\npaper, and tin dropped off at the<br />\nshed behind AMR I each week<br />\nserves as a clear illustration that<br />\nwe all share an eagerness to be<br />\nresponsible and less wasteful. As<br />\n<br />\na result, there are excellent indications that this fall will bring<br />\nUniversity-operated campus-wide<br />\nrecycling of white paper, glass,<br />\naluminum.<br />\nand<br />\nPlease use these containers all<br />\nthe time. Make a new habit of<br />\nrecycling white paper. Think of<br />\nhow much white paper is thrown<br />\naway on campus every day! If<br />\nyou are presented with the opportunity, buy recycled paper.<br />\nRecycling means even more<br />\nwhen you purchase recycled<br />\nproducts.<br />\nOver the summer SEA will be<br />\nrecycling on a scaled-down basis.<br />\nThe shed will be closed for<br />\nbusiness. Please take the good<br />\nhabits you've learned this<br />\nsemester to heart. The purpose of<br />\nSEA's efforts is to make recycl-<br />\n<br />\ning as convenient as possible<br />\nwhen possible, but it is also to<br />\neducate people about doing the<br />\nright thing on their own. If you<br />\nwill be in Charles Village, there<br />\nis a \"roll-off\" at the Farmer's<br />\nMarket located at 33rd and<br />\nBarclay Streets, where you can<br />\nbring your aluminum, glass, and<br />\ntin every Saturday from 8 a.m.<br />\nto noon. If you are at home, make<br />\nan effort to find a place nearby<br />\nto recycle.

We hope that<br />\nthe administration acts conscientiously and removes these<br />\ndisplays.<br />\n<br />\nlong ago, I heard a professor asked what the feeling was among<br />\nthe faculty regarding the FiveYear Plan; he said the question<br />\neveryone was asking one another<br />\nwas \"What's your latest offer?\"<br />\nThis sort of crisis atmosphere is<br />\nsimply not conducive to a stable<br />\nfaculty. And for the same reasons<br />\nthat professors generally don't<br />\nwant to stay at universities where<br />\nthey are not provided with sufficient financial and moral support<br />\nby the administration, professors<br />\ngenerally don't want to move to<br />\nsuch universities. Second, there<br />\nare just not that many senior professors of French out there. And<br />\nto hire assistant professors (or,<br />\nworse still, visiting assistant professor) to replace tenured full<br />\nand associate professors is to risk<br />\na significant loss of prestige<br />\n(which unfortunately, counts for<br />\nquite a hit in the grad school<br />\n<br />\nbusiness). Unfortunately, the<br />\ndepartment doesn't have much<br />\nchoice at this point. Third, searches for new professors usually<br />\nhave to begin at least one year<br />\nahead of time. Because the chairmanship of the department was in<br />\ndoubt until this spring, such<br />\nsearches were late in getting<br />\nunder way, through no fault of<br />\nthe current chair, Professor<br />\nAnderson. This is why the<br />\ndepartment is basically taking the<br />\nnext year off. Though the two remaining tenured professors\u2014<br />\nand<br />\nDefaux<br />\nProfessors<br />\nAnderson\u2014are excellent, they<br />\ncan't be expected to do<br />\neverything alone.<br />\nThe upshot of all this is that the<br />\nHopkins French Department is in<br />\nfor some tough times. Although<br />\nthis is not the first time that the<br />\nFrench Department has had to en<br />\ndure such a mass departure<br />\n(why?), each time it takes several<br />\nyears to recover and the quality<br />\n<br />\nof education in French inevitably<br />\nsuffers. Several years may be a<br />\nshort time in the life of an institution hut, for most of us, it's the<br />\nlength of an education. And even<br />\nthough the breakdown of a<br />\nFrench Department seemingly affects only those who are interested in French and French<br />\nliterature, it is an extremely inauspicious sign if it turns out that<br />\nthe University is willing to<br />\nsacrifice whole departments if<br />\nneed be in the name of a FiveYear Plan and a gratuitously imposed policy of budgetary decentralization. One wonders what the<br />\nadministration's priorities are.<br />\nI suppose it's too much to ask<br />\nthe News-Letter reporters who<br />\ncannot even figure out what is<br />\nhappening, to then go and investigate why. But an answer to<br />\nthat question\u2014\"Why is the<br />\nFrench Department falling<br />\napart?\"\u2014is both urgently needed and long overdue.<br />\n<br />\nTravel<br />\n\u2022Air Line Tickets\u2022Amtrak \u2022International Experts\u2022Tour Package.; Cruises\u2022Free Vi.?.Club \u2022 SpecialJHU Department<br />\n\u2022<br />\nAmtrak<br />\n\u2022<br />\nTickets<br />\nPrograms \u2022 Discounts for over 13,000 Hotel Properties Worldwide \u2022 Discounied Car Rental \u2022,Air Line<br />\nfor<br />\nInternational Experts\u2022 Tour Packages Cruises \u2022Free V.I.P.

Stewart<br />\nOne of the godfathers of the<br />\nearly '80s L.A. punk scene, John<br />\nDoe of the band X,once remarked that the reason for leaving his<br />\nhometown was the city's complete disinterest in new music.<br />\nThat city was Baltimore. To hear<br />\nhim talk, one imagines a scene<br />\ncomposed entirely of Lynrd<br />\nSkynrd cover bands with an occasional imitation-English synthpop group for contrast.<br />\nDoe wasn't alone in his disdain<br />\nfor Baltimore's indigenous<br />\nmusic. David Byrne and Frank<br />\nZappa were among the more<br />\nfamous musicians to split Charm<br />\nCity and make tracks for the more<br />\nfertile music scenes in New York<br />\nand Los Angeles. Sandwiched<br />\nbetween Philadelphia and the<br />\ncapital, and with New York a<br />\nshort two hours by train,<br />\nBaltimoreans who were serious<br />\nabout music saw little point in<br />\nsticking around trying to buck the<br />\nsmall town system, and moved<br />\nout. The happening scenes<br />\nthroughout the past ten years<br />\nwere in places like Boston,<br />\nHollywood, Seattle. and Athens,<br />\nGeorgia. Even Cleveland managed to generate good press.<br />\nBaltimore might be a good place<br />\nto get started, went the<br />\nthinking\u2014no pressure, accessible<br />\nvenues, lots of players\u2014but no<br />\none ever got famous playing<br />\nthere.<br />\nHow much this attitude has<br />\nreally changed in recent years is<br />\nimpossible to say. What has<br />\nchanged is the quality of music<br />\nbeing heard about the city.<br />\nGroups like Rhumba Club,<br />\nMonkeyspank, The Unknown,<br />\nand The Almighty Senators have<br />\nbeen attracting consistently large<br />\nand enthusiastic audiences,<br />\nas well as some major label attention. Some, like Rhumba Club,<br />\nhave already released albums,<br />\nwhile others either have releases<br />\non the way or are in the process<br />\nof recording. Nor are these few<br />\nalone. A host of promising<br />\n<br />\nyounger bands have been springing up like weeds, filling out<br />\nalready impressive local bills and<br />\ndrawing new crowds.<br />\nThe city's nascent music community seems to thrive on diversity, and one of its most diverse<br />\nnew groups is the sextet known<br />\nas the False Face Society. A<br />\nmixed group of males and<br />\nfemales, white and black, False<br />\nFace plays the music of its six<br />\nwriters in a style which might be<br />\ndescribed roughly as a kind of<br />\npan-global funk\u2014America meets<br />\nAfrica by way of the Caribbean,<br />\nperhaps. Understanding the<br />\nmusic's appeal, however, is<br />\nsimply a matter of listening.<br />\nIn an interview done a week<br />\nbefore their performance at the<br />\nHopkins Spring Fair, we had the<br />\nopportunity to discuss, amongst<br />\nother things, the city's club scene,<br />\nthe pros and cons of the so-called<br />\n\"world beat\" movement in<br />\npopular music, the segregation of<br />\nradio, and some of the band's<br />\nplans for the future.<br />\nGenesis<br />\nThe False Face Society\u2014Rob<br />\nWhite (percussion); Sheryl Bailey<br />\n(guitar, vocals); Steven Berson<br />\n(bass, vocals, percussion); Anne<br />\nX. Hairston (drums, percussion);<br />\nWarren Boes (guitar, vocals); and<br />\nShirle Hale (vocals, bass, percussion)\u2014sprang into being officially<br />\nin September 1989, minus Rob<br />\nWhite, who joined the group after<br />\nmeeting Berson during this year's<br />\nArtscape festival.<br />\nPrevious versions of the band<br />\nplayed in Boston while five of the<br />\nsix members (all but White) earned degrees at the Berklee School<br />\nof Musk, which has produced<br />\nsome of the decade's best (and<br />\nworst) jazz musicians.<br />\nPlaying Boston's clubs was<br />\nsomething less than a pleasant experience, however. Boston<br />\naudiences tend to maintain their<br />\ndistance, projecting an air of icy<br />\ndetachment in the face of the<br />\nfunkiest musical assaults. Worse,<br />\nBeantown club owners commonly<br />\n<br />\nuse a sort of quota system to<br />\ndetermine which group, out of the<br />\ntwo or three they might book in<br />\na night, has the greatest number<br />\nof(paying) fans. You don't pay<br />\nto play so much as you pay to<br />\nplay ever again. The result, accordingly, is rivalry, paranoia,<br />\nanxiety, and various other kinds<br />\nof bad karma. Boston was not all<br />\nit was supposed to be. Certainly,<br />\nit was not the place to be.<br />\nThat dissatisfaction led in part<br />\nto the move south. Hairston was<br />\nthe first to move down, taking up<br />\nresidence in D.C. after<br />\ngraduating in 1988. The following June, with the encouragement<br />\nof Berson's childhood friend Mitchell Vaillant, percussionist with<br />\nThe Almighty Senators, Hale,<br />\nBerson, and Boes took the<br />\nplunge.<br />\nThey liked what they found\u2014<br />\na lower cost of living and a<br />\nviable, less uptight music<br />\nscene\u2014and it wasn't long<br />\nthereafter that Bailey made the<br />\nmove as well. Bailey, who with<br />\nBerson manages to make a living<br />\nas a musician, called Hairston<br />\nbefore coming down: \"Sheryl<br />\ncalls me up and asks, 'If I came<br />\nto D.C. do you think I could get<br />\nsome work and play?' Needless<br />\nto say, I silently screamed, 'Get<br />\nyour butt down here!\"<br />\nThe Charm of Charm City<br />\nThe move seems to have suited<br />\neveryone involved, at least in<br />\nterms of their music's reception.<br />\n\"People in Baltimore come out<br />\nto listen to good music, and if<br />\nthey like what they hear, they'll<br />\nbe back,\" claims White. Boes<br />\nagrees, adding with a touch of<br />\nirony, \"And they'll dance, too.<br />\nPeople like to dance around<br />\nhere.\" Dealing with clubs has<br />\nproven less difficult, as well.<br />\nChambers, a small club downtown<br />\non Bourbon Street, is one of their<br />\nfavorites. It features a relaxed atmosphere in which to perform<br />\nand a crisp, modern sound<br />\nsystem. Berson likens it to playing one's living room: \"You<br />\n<br />\nFrom Warped Minds...<br />\nby Cristian Tampe<br />\n<br />\n(k7<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\nft%<br />\n<br />\nTh.fts<br />\n<br />\nme.<br />\n<br />\n\"Pick-Me-Up\" Bouquets<br />\n<br />\nFilms in Brief<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nPretty Woman<br />\nIf one ignores the rather disturbing ground situation of Garry<br />\nMarshall's latest comedy, there's<br />\na charming modern-day fairy tale<br />\nbrushing its locks underneath. Vivian (Julia Roberts) is not even<br />\nclassy enough to be a call girl\u2014<br />\nshe's nothing more than a cheap<br />\nhooker with a sense of humor.<br />\nCorporate raider Edward Louis<br />\n(Richard Gere) asks her for directions and ends up hiring her for<br />\nthe week, breaking down his<br />\nMBA-world into digestible prostitute parts. Roberts is charming,<br />\nand Gere seems to have settled<br />\nnicely into a middle-aged maturi-<br />\n<br />\nty. \"We're similar creatures,\"<br />\nhis character says. \"We both<br />\nscrew people for money.\" The<br />\nfilm tries to be tender, and it<br />\nmostly succeeds. But there is<br />\nsomething unsettling (and almost<br />\nincestuous) about young<br />\nHollywood trash as older man's<br />\nobject, even a pampered one. J.F.<br />\nLawton's script needs to do a little better job of chiselling motives<br />\nout of beautiful bodies, since the<br />\nlast thing \"Pretty Woman\" wants<br />\nis for the audience to feel guilty<br />\nabout liking it.<br />\nThe Hunt for Red October<br />\nTom Clancy's mega-bestselling<br />\nnovel is transformed by director<br />\nJohn McTiernan into a bloated<br />\n<br />\nvessel, an exercise in waterlogged boredom.

The United<br />\nStates government braces for the<br />\nBig One, but perky CIA analyst<br />\nJack Ryan (Alec Baldwin) figures<br />\nout that Ramius is really trying to<br />\ndefect.

Smiling because I had enjoyed the film thoroughly,<br />\nthoughtful because it had shown<br />\nme things I hadn't seen before,<br />\nand dazed because it was a<br />\nbeautiful, complex work to experience. The film draws you in<br />\nwith its warmth and humor, then<br />\ndeals out it themes\u2014religion and<br />\nits interpretation, love among<br />\nfriends, and personal sacrifice\u2014<br />\nwith the gentle strokes of an artist's brush.<br />\nIn the film, Daniel Coulombe<br />\n(Lothaire Bluteau) is an experimental actor who happens<br />\nupon the idea to enact the Passion<br />\nPlay, a performance of the gospel<br />\nthat describes the life, death, and<br />\nrebirth of Jesus. But his concept<br />\nis unorthodox: he wants to perform it on the grounds of a church<br />\nin the mountains overlooking<br />\nMontreal. And rather than performing on a stage, Coulombe wants<br />\nto alter the surrounding landscape<br />\nso that it resembles the ancient<br />\nMiddle East, and then conduct the<br />\naudience through it.<br />\nWhat's more, his version of the<br />\nplay is an interpretation that<br />\nviews Jesus as a prophet but also as<br />\nthe natural son of Mary and a<br />\nRoman Soldier. He draws around<br />\nhim four other actors who share<br />\nin his vision; as they practice and<br />\nperform, their friendship grows.<br />\nTheir play, in the meantime,<br />\nbecomes all the rage in Montreal,<br />\nand crowds of all kinds come to<br />\nexperience the Gospel coming<br />\nalive in front of them. The conflict begins when conservative<br />\nforces from the Roman Catholic<br />\nchurch decide that Coulombe's<br />\nversion strays too far from what<br />\nthey want to see. The controversy soon escalates to a point of<br />\ncrisis and of violence; in the process, Coulombe and his troupe<br />\nslowly reproduce in their own<br />\nlives the Gospel story that they<br />\nperform each night before an<br />\naudience.<br />\nThe situation is intriguing from<br />\nthe start, and director Denys Arcand fills his landscapes\u2014real<br />\nand Biblical\u2014with a wealth of<br />\ncharacters ranging from the<br />\ncharismatic to the just plain<br />\nsleazy. With his long, peaceful<br />\n<br />\nface, Bluteau cuts a striking<br />\nfigure as Jesus. As the actor, one<br />\nbelieves him as the loving, inspired, and unusally driven young<br />\nartist; as Jesus, it isn't much of<br />\na stretch to see him healing the<br />\nblind and walking on water.<br />\nBluteau carries a gently intense<br />\nmanner that makes him a powerful central figure around which to<br />\ncontruct a film.<br />\nOther performance are equally good. Coulombe's comrades<br />\nare each very different, but all are<br />\nbelievable in their real and<br />\nBiblical manifestations. From the<br />\nyoung Canadian model who is<br />\nsearching for herself to the<br />\nstaunch older actor who upholds<br />\nCoulombe's vision in the face ot<br />\ngrowing opposition.<br />\nArcand also adorns his world<br />\nwith a variety of smaller<br />\ncharacters which, although less<br />\ncrucial to the tone of the film, are<br />\ndelightful and well performed.<br />\nThere is the sleazy young lawyer<br />\nwho wants to help Coulombe<br />\n\"take the city\" with his popularity; the googly eyed guard of the<br />\nchurchgrounds; the cynical,<br />\nhedonistic advertising director;<br />\nand the spastic radio talk-show<br />\nhostess.<br />\nAs with most of \"Jesus of<br />\nMontreal,\" it is Arcand's light<br />\ntouch, particularly with comedy,<br />\nthat allows this all to work. In one<br />\nscene Coulombe has an interview<br />\nwith a psychiatrist appointed by<br />\nthe state, who reports that he is<br />\nmore sane than anyone within the<br />\ngovernment itself. In another,<br />\ntwo dancers audition for a beer<br />\ncommercial in which they sing<br />\nlyrics of near-idolatry to the product they are hawking.<br />\nIn several instances, the rupture<br />\nbetween play and reality leads to<br />\nhumorous consequences, as profane and sacred worlds intrude<br />\nupon one another. At one point,<br />\npolice inspectors approach<br />\nJesus/Coulombe on the crucifix,<br />\na disciple quotes Hamlet's soliloquy, and audience members run<br />\nforward and embrace Coulombe<br />\nto \"save\" him. At another point<br />\nin the film, the actors interpret the<br />\nPassion Play in various theatrical<br />\ngenres: comedic francais, New<br />\nYork method acting, and Kabuki.<br />\nThroughout, Arcand creates a<br />\nmood that is stunning to experience. We see Coulombe on<br />\nthe crucifix at night, overlooking<br />\n<br />\n\"two<br />\n<br />\nthe flickering lights of Montreal.<br />\nWe find ourselves over deep blue<br />\ncityscapes with piercing, sweet<br />\nguitar music in the background.<br />\nIn the Passion Play scenes, there<br />\nis an aura of magic: amid the<br />\nwhirring of birds and orange light<br />\nof torches, we see Jesus walking<br />\non water and handing out bread<br />\nto the chanting of hymns. And we<br />\nare there as the audience as well,<br />\nhard-pressed to separate the actors from the Biblical roles they<br />\nplay.<br />\n\"Jesus of Montreal\" has its<br />\nfaults, however, and there are occasional gaps in an otherwise integrated fabric. These occur<br />\nwhen Arcand is too overbearing<br />\nwith his theme\u2014when he sets<br />\ndown his paintbrushes and picks<br />\nup rubber mallets instead. In one<br />\nscene, for example, a formerly<br />\nhard-nosed priest buckles under,<br />\nrevealing too suddenly the deep<br />\ninsecurities he has about his faith.<br />\nReligion, he says with no consistency, is not about truth, but<br />\nabout delusion: delusion of the<br />\nsad, the lonely, and the lost. True<br />\nor not, his speech is<br />\nunconvincing.<br />\nIn another heavy-handed scene,<br />\na delirious Coulombe gives a<br />\nlong, surreal speech in a subway<br />\nstation, wandering from person to<br />\nintently listening person, none of<br />\nwhom shun him, run away, or go<br />\nfor help. It's not that either of<br />\nthese scenes is terrible, only that<br />\nin a piece as natural as this one,<br />\nthey seem unusually staged and<br />\nartifical.<br />\nDespite these heavy handed<br />\nepisodes, however, \"Jesus of<br />\nMontreal\" is a film to be commended. For as Coulombe is<br />\ndrawn along his journey into the<br />\nsymbolic world of Biblical<br />\nteaching, so are we. \"Jesus of<br />\nMontreal\" is in many ways an<br />\nEaster film, but it doesn't suffer<br />\na few weeks after the fact. The<br />\nlessons it has to teach, of love and<br />\npersonal sacrifice, have been<br />\naround far longer than that, with<br />\nno ill effects.<br />\n\"Jesus of Montreal\" will be<br />\nshown at the Baltimore Museum<br />\nofArt Saturday, April 28, at 9:45<br />\np.m., as part of the Baltimore<br />\nFilm Festival. Tickets are $5for<br />\nthe general public, and $4 for<br />\nstudents, Film Forum and<br />\nMuseum members, and seniors.<br />\nCall 889-1993 for information.<br />\n<br />\n\f8/APRIL 27, 1990<br />\n<br />\nRECORDS<br />\n<br />\nFilms in Brief<br />\n<br />\nA Fractured<br />\n'Rock Fable'<br />\nVarious Artists\u2014Requiem For<br />\nthe Americas (Enigma)<br />\nby John H. Park<br />\nJust one of life's little ironies,<br />\nI guess, that this derivative,<br />\npretentious, predictably bombastic \"rock fable\" (reportedly<br />\nthe first) should come from the<br />\nsame mind that scored the PBS<br />\nseries \"The Brain.\" Or maybe<br />\nnot, for this is also the mind<br />\nwhich scored the soporific \"9\u00bd<br />\nWeeks,\" \"Children of the<br />\nCorn,\" and Cheech and Chong's<br />\n\"Rude Awakening.\" The mind<br />\n(and talent) in question is<br />\nJonathan Elias, a classically<br />\ntrained pianist who, movies<br />\naside, also produced quite competently the last albums by Grace<br />\nJones and Duran Duran. Like<br />\nSting before him, however, Elias<br />\nhas let his ambition get the better of him, allowing more ideas,<br />\nconcepts, and good intentions to<br />\nsuffice for basic songwriting<br />\ncraft.<br />\nThe concept here is the plight<br />\nof the American Indian and his<br />\nculture, which Elias seems to feel<br />\nis being subsumed into<br />\nmainstream America to ill effect.<br />\nTo illustrate this slow decay Elias<br />\nhas written an allegorical story<br />\nwherein the citizenry of an<br />\nisolated American Indian village<br />\nare robbed of their souls by a<br />\nmysterious photographer, the<br />\nShadow Catcher from The Lost<br />\nWorld. The sanctity of the race<br />\ncan only be restored by the (what<br />\nelse) elder lhala, a wise shaman<br />\nwho had warned his people of the<br />\nShadow Catcher's threat in the<br />\nfirst place. It is he who must<br />\njourney to the Lost World and<br />\nrecover the frozen souls by<br />\nsacrificing himself.<br />\nThis is the idea, anyway. To<br />\nhelp him realize these deeply personal visions (inspired by \"The<br />\nLife and Times of a Shadow Cat-<br />\n<br />\ncher,\" a series of pictorialist<br />\nworks by Edward Curtis), Elias<br />\nhas surrounded himself with a<br />\ncoterie of his best celebrity<br />\nfriends. It's the type of supercasting which usually counts<br />\nmore for names than talent. So it<br />\nis that we find amongst \"Requiem' 's dozens of studio musicians legendary performers like<br />\nJon Anderson, Jon Waite, John<br />\nTaylor, Simon LeBon, Nick<br />\nRhodes, Grace Jones, Michael<br />\nBolton, Stewart Copeland, Susanna Hoffs, ad nauseam. The only<br />\nsurprise is that U2 or Bruce<br />\nSpringsteen or Bruce Hornsby<br />\ndidn't show up.<br />\nThe late Jim Morrison also<br />\nmakes an appearance in the form<br />\nof poetry readings, reputedly<br />\nrecorded shortly before his death<br />\nand recently released by his<br />\nestate, which Elias sets to music<br />\non \"The Journey\" and \"The<br />\nChant Movement.\" This last is<br />\nthe strongest cut on the album,<br />\nwith its weird, buzzing chanting<br />\n(provided by Jones, Liam<br />\nO'Maunlai, and The Boys Choir<br />\nof Harlem) and tense, charged<br />\nelectronics recalling HaightAshbury as much as they do a<br />\nDakota plain. Taken out of context, Morrison's verse is quite<br />\nlame, but couched as it is here<br />\namidst the primal, pseudo-mystic<br />\ntrappings, lines like \"I know the<br />\nimpossible sea when the dogs<br />\nbark\" seem right at home. Certainly one for the Doors fanatic.<br />\nOther high points include Toni<br />\nChilds' unforgettable, throaty<br />\nphrasings on \"I've Not Forgotten You.\" When she calls \"take<br />\nme back/take me back,\" you will<br />\nget chills. \"Follow in My<br />\nFootsteps,\" the LP's poppiest<br />\ntrack, is also quite nice, though<br />\nto my ears it sounds more like an<br />\nouttake from Peter Gabriel's<br />\n\"So\" than a Native American entreaty for solidarity; Susanna<br />\nHoff's backing vocal corn-<br />\n<br />\nFILMS, from 7<br />\nLarry Ferguson and Mark<br />\nStewart) hangs Connery out to<br />\ndry. Ramius is neither glorified<br />\nnor pathetic: he just drifts<br />\nsomewhere in between. Simply<br />\nput, all the elements that make<br />\n\"The Hunt for Red October\"<br />\nsuch a satisfying read\u2014gritty<br />\ndetails of docking collars and propulsion systems\u2014don't translate.<br />\nPerhaps this atrocious film will<br />\nmark not only the end of the Cold<br />\nWar but also the extinction of the<br />\ntechnothriller, the monster of the<br />\nun-literature that Clancy himself<br />\ncreated.<br />\n<br />\nJonathan Elias<br />\nplements Simon LeBon's in much<br />\nthe same way Kate Bush's did<br />\nGabriel's on \"Don't Give Up.\"<br />\nIndeed, it's a problem throughout<br />\nmuch of \"Requiem.\" Where<br />\nElias seeks Amerindian authenticity and atmosphere, he appropriates/plunders many of the<br />\ncross-cultural melodic and<br />\npolyrhythmic nuances Gabriel explored on his first two albums,<br />\nand more recently on \"Passion.\"<br />\nWhen Elias isn't doing this, he<br />\njust lets his synthesizers soar in<br />\ndirectionless,<br />\nthough<br />\na<br />\nundeniably majestic-sounding,<br />\nmorass of melody.<br />\nThe rest of the songs, while not<br />\nquite throwaway, are filled with<br />\na certain cloying pomposity<br />\nreminiscent of early Yes, Rush,<br />\nand Pink Floyd. Jon Anderson,<br />\nwho is featured prominentl,. on<br />\ntwo songs, must have felt right at<br />\nhome. I found it just plain<br />\nlaughable. It doesn't help either<br />\nthat the \"mystic,\" juvenile lyrics<br />\noften make only passing<br />\nreference to the \"story\" at hand.<br />\nNot surprisingly, the album's<br />\nworst, most embarrassing<br />\nmoments come when it takes<br />\nitself most seriously, as in part<br />\ntwo of \"Far Far Cry,\u2014 the<br />\n<br />\nJacob Getz<br />\n<br />\nhighly programmable (and MORish) first single, wherein Michael<br />\nBolton and Pattie Darcy<br />\neviscerate any notions of sincerity<br />\nwith their completely overblown<br />\n\"soulful\" wailing. Just as bad is<br />\nthe closer, \"Father and Son,\"<br />\nwhere Martin and Charlie Sheen,<br />\ntrying atrociously hard to sound<br />\nlike gods, read adapted<br />\nAlgonkian/Sioux/Arapahoe/Pai<br />\nute poetry which has lost much<br />\nin translation.<br />\nIn the end, Elias just does not<br />\nserve his theme. The inevitable<br />\ncollusion and misappropriation of<br />\ncultures in this country is surely<br />\na worthy, universal subject, but<br />\nthe smug self-righteousness with<br />\nwhich Elias orchestrates his minidramas never allows his songs to<br />\nrise above mere nonsense.

The crowd went<br />\nwild when he went high; clearly<br />\nthey appreciated his only (and in<br />\nmy mind, questionable) talent.<br />\nThe kindest thing to say about<br />\nMaynard Ferguson is that he is a<br />\nshowman, with all the negative<br />\nconnotations that implies.

The influence of African,<br />\nCaribbean, and South American<br />\nmusic is evident in the way each<br />\nof the writers approaches composition.

From<br />\nSaturday, June 2 to Sunday, June<br />\n3 riders travel on backroads from<br />\nCatonsville Community College<br />\nto Anne Arundel Community<br />\nCollege and back. While 150 km<br />\nmay seem like a lot of riding (92<br />\nmiles), participants have all of 2<br />\ndays to complete it. And it's a<br />\ntour, not a race; there's no incentive to finish first.<br />\nIf riders do have trouble keeping pace, rest stations and \"sag<br />\nwagons\" offer relief.

In addition, they must collect at least<br />\n$150 in pledges by the time of the<br />\ntour.

Another hangs<br />\nin the conference room, where<br />\nthe medical examiners meet each<br />\nmorning to discuss death in<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nEach year in Maryland, 40,000<br />\npeople die. Roughly a quarter of<br />\nthe deaths are sudden and unexpected: homicides, suicides,<br />\nmotor vehicle accidents,<br />\nsuspicious deaths, and deaths of<br />\npeople not under the care of a<br />\nphysician. All sudden and unex-<br />\n<br />\nModel<br />\n<br />\nFnshot<br />\n<br />\npected deaths must be reported to<br />\nthe Maryland Office of the Chief<br />\nMedical Examiner.<br />\nThe deputy Medical Examiner<br />\nfor the county checks out each<br />\nreported death. If he is satisfied<br />\nthat the cause of death listed on<br />\nthe death certificate is correct, he<br />\nallows the attending physician to<br />\nsign it. Otherwise, he begins an<br />\ninvestigation. He examines the<br />\nbody for external evidence, tries<br />\nto find out what the subject was<br />\ndoing immediately before his<br />\ndeath, and whether drugs or<br />\nalcohol might have been<br />\ninvolved.<br />\nIf he still cannot determine a<br />\ncause of death, he arranges for<br />\nthe body to be sent to the central<br />\noffice in Baltimore for an autopsy. The staff here conduct 3400<br />\nautopsies every year. To begin an<br />\n<br />\nautoposy, males are cut open with<br />\na Y-shaped incision, from each<br />\nshoulder down through the abdomen. Females receive a<br />\nmodified incision around the<br />\nsides of the breasts. All major<br />\norgans are removed and examined carefully for gross physical<br />\nsigns of disease. Small sections<br />\nof each organ are sliced off to be<br />\nanalyzed, and the remainder is<br />\nreturned to the corpse. Complex<br />\nhomicide cases can take as long<br />\nas five hours to autopsy.<br />\nMuch may be learned from the<br />\ntissue samples. The histology<br />\nlaboratory prepares slides for the<br />\nmedical examiner. Specific findings can indicate particular illnesses, for example, sections of<br />\nheart muscle show damaged cells<br />\nwhen there has been a heart attack. Blood vessel diameter will<br />\n<br />\nthen be checked for evidence of<br />\narteriosclerosis, a thickening of<br />\nthe walls that can cause a heart<br />\nattack. Arteriosclerosis in young<br />\nbodies can indicate cocaine use.<br />\nSome illnesses cannot be confirmed until after death.<br />\nAlzheimer's disease cannot be<br />\ndefinitively diagnosed without an<br />\nautopsy, when sections of the<br />\ncerebral cortex are stained and<br />\nexamined for the characteristic<br />\nprotein plaques of the disease.<br />\nBlood and other body fluids are<br />\nsampled as well. The medical examiner orders the tests he wants<br />\nperformed by the toxicology<br />\nlaboratory. All samples are tested<br />\nfor blood alcohol content. If the<br />\nmedical examiner suspects drug<br />\nuse, he can order a full or partial<br />\ntoxicology screening.<br />\nSamples are separated into<br />\ncomponents by chromatography,<br />\nthen analyzed by the mass spectrometer, which is connected to<br />\na computer. The program compares the spectrum of the<br />\nunknown with a library of known<br />\ndrugs and toxins.<br />\nThe medical examiners have<br />\nthe legal right to autopsy a body<br />\nto find the cause of death. At<br />\ntimes it has a personal importance<br />\nas well: an autopsy can often help<br />\nfamily members cope with their<br />\ngrief and guilt by proving that the<br />\nvictim could not have been saved.<br />\nSocial programs need cause-ofdeath statistics in order to target<br />\ntheir efforts towards those most<br />\nat risk. Homicide cases often require the testimony of medical examiners, who explain the cause<br />\nof death to the judge and jury.<br />\nMedical examiners are physicians who have done a residency<br />\nin pathology and have received<br />\nfellowship training in forensic<br />\npathology.<br />\n<br />\nSharyn Horowitz<br />\n<br />\nSharyn Horowitz<br />\n<br />\nMedical Examiners' memorabilia<br />\n<br />\nBill Henry, M.E.<br />\nReporters<br />\nand<br />\nphotographers are not allowed<br />\nto watch autopsies, out of<br />\nrespect for the privacy of the<br />\nsubject's family.

Since that time, there<br />\nhave been priests who have resided there and who have provid-<br /><br />\ned religious guidance for the<br />\nCatholic community on campus.<br />\nLast year, the archdiocese of<br />\nBaltimore had to cut their budget,<br />\nand Hopkins, according to Gale,<br />\n\"ended up being one of the two<br />\ncampuses cut.\"<br />\n\"We lost all funding and the<br />\npriests,\" Gale said. \"So, the<br />\nstudents, faculty, and administrators all wrote letters to<br />\nthe archdiocesse . . .They let us<br />\nkeep the house. . .

As students committed to the<br />\nUniversity, we find the atmosphere at Homewood alarming.<br />\nWhile the size of the Homewood faculty is expected to fall by<br />\nsome seven and a half percent over the next several years. the<br />\nadministration is due to grow by ten percent. This disparity<br />\nis largely responsible for the faculty's feeling of relative<br />\nunimportance.<br />\nJohns Hopkins should be the 'hottest' school on the East Coast<br />\namong undergraduates, graduates, and faculty. It is not. Conversations with many members of the Arts and Sciences faculty reveal a sense of alienation from their University which is<br />\nfrightening. To change this, and to continue to attract faculty<br />\nand students of a caliber to which Hopkins aspires, we offer<br />\nthe following suggestions to president --elect Richardson:<br />\nI. Abandon the arbitrary Five Year Plan and devise a scheme<br />\nto bring sustainable finances to the Arts and Sciences. Faculty<br />\nand student involvement should be central to such an undertaking, not marginalized as it was by Muller. Lombardi et al.<br />\nMost important from an undergraduate perspective, we need<br />\nto reduce undergraduate enrollment such that all departments<br />\ncan feasibly mandate senior theses, if appropriate A smaller<br />\nstudent body would also make it possible for the faculty to offer seminar size (15 students) classes again for the majority of<br />\nupper-level course offering. Such classes are the historical<br />\nessence of a Hopkins undergraduate education. There were approximately 600 undergraduates per class here in the 1970's,<br />\nbefore the Administration began to look upon us as walking,<br />\ntalking revenue. We should return to this size. Such a move<br />\nis also advocated by a significant proportion of the faculty.<br />\n2. Provide the professors with adequate support staff so that<br />\nthey will not shrink from teaching undergraduates. If a pro-<br /><br />\nfessor is forced to make a choice between doing the busywork<br />\nfor an important paper, which he or she is pressured by the<br />\nAdministration to publish, and carefully planning and grading<br />\nan undergraduate class, in which he or she is pressured to maximize enrollment, there is little doubt as to which will suffer.<br />\nTeaching will not advance anyone's career, as Dr. David was<br />\nSO ignominiously informed last year. More support staff would<br />\nmake it a pleasure fOr the faculty to teach, rather than a trial.<br />\n3. Slash the size of the Administration. The current organization's ineffectiveness has been manifested in countless ways.<br />\nincluding the descent of Arts and Sciences into deficit. Hundreds of American corporations have found themselves liberated<br />\nafter firing superfluous mid-level management. There is no<br />\nreason that this should not be the case here: hand the University back to the faculty, with whom the Administration should<br />\nhe in league, not oppostion. If we don't, it is only a matter of<br />\ntime until other departments follow the French Department's<br />\nexample.<br />\n4. Articulate a mission for the School of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nThe School is profoundly lacking a meaningful identity around<br />\nwhich students and faculty can rally. Delve into the University's past, and unearth a historical continuity which is something<br />\nmore substantial than platitudes to \"excellence in education.\"<br />\nEssentially, decide why we are all here.<br />\nHopkins is a unique place with a great deal going for it,<br />\nacademically and professionally. Yet the Muller Administration became extremely distant from the University's academic<br />\nessence. Over time, the indifference this distance bred came<br />\nto undermine the faculty and the School of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nThe alienation and lack of unity which now characterize much<br />\nof faculty and student life here are just two of the consequences.<br />\nThe first thing that the Richardson administration must do is<br />\nend this estrangement. It must do so immediately, decisively,<br />\nand publicly. Otherwise, as the French department's departure<br />\nhas shown, the consequences may be dreadful.<br /><br />\nCiao, babes. We're gone<br />\nIt's Thursday night and the final issue of the News-Letter is<br />\nbeing put to bed here at the Gatehouse. After twenty-three<br />\nsleepless Thursday nights we find it hard to believe the ordeal<br />\nis over for this academic year. But, alas, it is, and, as has been<br />\na tradition when the editors-in-chief take their final bows, we<br />\nwould like to take a look back over the year and find a few<br />\nparticularly poignant moments when we actually tackled some<br />\ndifficult issues.<br />\nThe top five stori\u00e7 of th,e yeiir.,folilow. As ,tiard, as it, may<br />\nbe to believe, the cartoon debates were not the sole foci of our<br />\npaper. So much has happened at Hopkins during this past year<br />\nthat it is difficult to narrow the field, but here goes:<br />\nI. Steven Muller departed the nerd-like atmosphere of<br />\nHopkins after 18 years of service: \"I do want to write a<br />\nbook,...but obviously, I'm not engaged in raising money as<br />\na tribute to me; other people are doing that .......--Muller,<br />\nin N-L interview, 2/2/90.<br />\n2. Richardson appointed as new president: \"He's the kind of<br />\nguy who would like to hold hands with everybody\"----a Hopkins<br />\nprofessor. \"He's not Mr. Dynanism, hut after a while he grows<br />\non you\"\u2014Lou Giangiulio. On a more serious note: \"We're<br />\ngoing to make sure that our faculty know that we care a lot<br /><br />\nthat they're here at Hopkins and we want them to stay\"<br />\nRichardson during initial press conference, 2/2/90.<br />\n3. The launch of the Hubble Space Telescope: \"As late as<br />\nnine minutes before the scheduled takeoff,...a group of Space<br />\nTelescope Science Institute staff had started eating Crackerjacks.\"\u2014Science, 4/1 3/90. The Challenger catastrophe was attributed by some NASA technicians to the fact that, for the first<br />\nand only time, they were not eating Crackerjacks during that<br />\nlaunch.<br />\n.<br />\n4. The announcement of extensive housing renovations:<br />\n\"We're looking at that whole area as a piece of the campus<br />\nwhich happens to be across Charles Street...We want to get<br />\nthe psychological barrier out of people's minds...When you go<br />\nacross Charles Street, you're not in some Twilight Zone'<br />\nChris Colombo, Dean of Homewood Schools Services, 2/2/90.<br />\n5. Junior Andy Enfield led the basketball team to the NCAA<br />\nDivision III Sweet Sixteen while breaking the all-time Hopkins<br />\nscoring record: \"Andy has been a major factor in the turnaround<br />\nin Hopkins basketball\"\u2014Coach Bill Nelson, 2/2/90.<br />\nAnd on a final note, now that all this self-praise is over with,<br />\nwe would like to wish the incoming staff fm 1990-1991 good<br />\nluck. You're going to need it.<br /><br />\netters<br />\nCrime<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am a graduating senior, and<br />\nalthough 1 am leaving Baltimore<br />\nin June I feel I have to voice my<br />\nconcern about an apparent increase in crime in the Charles<br />\nVillage area It is very disturbing<br />\nto me, and I believe it poses a<br />\ngreat threat to every student, no<br />\nnutter when be or she lives. I believe<br />\nthat the University should do<br />\nmore to inform and protect its<br />\nstudents and its employees,<br />\nbefore more incidents occur.<br />\nAfter reading of crime reported<br />\nin last week's News-Letter, I contacted Baltimore City Police and<br />\nwas told some disturbing facts<br />\nabout an increase in crime citywide. Compared to the first<br />\nquarter last year:<br />\n*Larceny up 18.9% (number<br />\nof incidents 7304 to 8681)<br />\n*Burglary up 13.9% (3048 to<br />\n3471)<br />\n*Aggravated Assault up 24.6%<br />\n(1498 to 1867)<br />\n*Automobile Theft up 40.0(X<br />\n(1729 to 2420)<br />\n*Murder up 25.5% (55 to 69)<br />\n*Rape up 32.7% (113 to 150)<br />\n*Robbery up 27.6% (1803 to<br />\n2301)<br />\nOverall, the crime index is up<br />\n21.9% for January. February,<br />\nand March, for felony crimes. 1<br />\nwas also told that this was not an<br />\nunusual increase in crime for an<br />\nEastern Seaboard city. Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain<br />\nstatistics for crime in the immediate JHU area. hut I feel that<br /><br />\nit is important for all students to<br />\nbecome aware of the frequency<br />\nof crimes in and around the campus. Only then can informed<br />\nstudents act accordingly. To the<br />\ncredit of Hopkins security,<br />\nbulletins are issued now when<br />\nthere is a major incident, or an<br />\nincident involving a member of<br />\nthe Hopkins community, but this<br />\nis not enough to inform the<br />\nstudents of the full scope of<br />\ndanger.<br />\nA source at the northern district<br />\ninformed me that on the same<br />\nnight (Thursday, April 19)of the<br />\narmed robbely assault on a<br />\nHopkins woman there were two<br /><br />\nother armed robberies in the<br />\nvicinity that we were not informed about. There was an arrest<br />\nmade in one incident, but the<br />\npolice say there was no reason to<br />\nbelieve that the crimes were connected. One of the incidents took<br />\nplace at 28th and Guilford, the<br />\nother on Art Museum Drive. I<br />\nbelieve it is incumbent upon<br />\nHopkins officials to start informing people about these and other<br />\nincidents so that people (especially students) do not find<br />\nthemselves lulled into a false<br />\nsense of security as the streets<br />\nbecome more and more unsafe.<br />\nI believe that Hopkins should take<br /><br />\nthe next logical step in protecting<br />\nits students and strongly encourage all students to attend selfdefense workshops, provided by<br />\nthe University. The purpose of<br />\nthese workshops might be multifold, including education and<br />\npractical defense measures. The<br />\nUniversity needs to take more<br />\nsteps in evidencing their concern<br />\nabout safety. Both men and<br />\nwomen need to be prepared with<br />\nmore than a rape whistle.<br />\nAlthough the Hopkins security force does advocate following<br />\nguidelines,<br />\nprecautionary<br />\nSee LETTERS, 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/5<br /><br />\nSpeaker's Corner<br /><br />\nE -Level<br /><br />\nStephen Schwartz<br /><br />\nby Kathy Korbuly<br /><br />\nfrom the French Department<br />\nLike most graduate students in<br />\nArts and Sciences, I've known<br />\nabout the impending decimation<br />\nof the French Department for<br />\nseveral months now. It has thus<br />\nbeen rather distressing for me to<br />\nopen the News-Letter every week<br />\nand find a seemingly endless<br />\nparade of articles and letters concerning the worthy topics of Fiji<br />\nIslanders, Spring Fairs, sexist<br />\ncartoons, and the like, with nary<br />\na word about the demise of the<br />\nFrench Department. 1 was quite<br />\nsurprised when a front-page article finally \"broke\" the news on<br />\nApril 20.<br />\nUnfortunately, the author of the<br />\narticle in question couldn't be<br />\nbothered to actually investigate<br />\nthe story (too much French<br />\nhomework, no doubt) and the<br />\nresulting report apparently relies<br />\nentirely on information gleaned<br />\nfrom the department secretary,<br />\nKitty Letsch. Although a reporter<br />\nmight correctly expect the departmental secretary to be a useful<br />\nsource, to rely entirely on any<br />\nsingle version of the facts is irresponsible to say the least. The<br />\nresulting puff-piece should serve<br />\nto reassure those students who<br />\nhad heard the rumors and feared<br />\nthe worst: don't worry, \"the<br />\ndepartment is still here.\" One<br />\nquestion that should have been<br />\nasked, or should have been asked more insistently and of a<br />\ngreater number of people, is:<br />\nwhat sort of department is it that<br />\nis \"still here\"? The students at<br />\nHopkins deserve a more accurate<br />\nanswer to this question than that<br />\nprovided in the article.<br />\nI am currently a second-year<br /><br />\ngraduate student in the French<br />\nDepartment and here are some of<br />\nthe facts as I understand them:<br />\nThree out of the five current<br />\nprofessors are leaving Hopkins<br />\nfor Emory University: Professors<br />\nVincent Descombes, Suzanne<br />\nGuerlac, and Josue Harari who,<br />\nuntil recently, was the department<br />\nchair. If one takes into account<br />\nthat the department lost a professor last year who was not<br />\nreplaced (due, as far as 1 can tell,<br />\nto the austerity budget imposed<br />\nunder the Five-Year Plan\u2014it was<br />\napparently the administration's<br />\nshort-sighted refusal to allow for<br />\na replacement that precipitated<br />\nthe departure of Descombes,<br />\nGuerlac and Harari), the professorial corps for 1990-91 will<br />\nbe at 33 percent of its size in<br />\n1988-89. Contrary to what was<br />\nwritten in the article, Laurence<br />\nSelim, though delightful and a<br />\nsuperb teacher (or so I'm told),<br />\nis not a professor. Since the fortunes of most graduate students<br />\nare (for better or for worse) inextricably linked to those of their<br />\nprospective or actual thesis advisors, one result of this professorial exodus is that of the 20<br />\ncurrent graduate students in<br />\nFrench, by my count 10 are accepting offers at Emory, 2 are going to other graduate schools, 1<br />\nis talking time off to think things<br />\nover, 1 got a job, and 6 are staying. It is at best misleading to say<br />\nthat \"most graduate students will<br />\nstudy at a university in France<br />\nnext year.\" Most of the graduate<br />\nstudents are leaving for good. Of<br />\nthose who are staying, most if not<br />\nall will be in France next year and<br /><br />\nit will be difficult, though not impossible, for the department to attract new graduate students in the<br />\ncurrent situation.<br />\nSo where does that leave the<br />\nFrench Department? The author<br />\nof the article did have the<br />\nperspicacity to open a course<br />\ncatalogue. He was dismayed by<br />\nthe dearth of upper level courses.<br />\nAnd well he should be. But he<br />\nshould also have asked himself<br />\nwho is going to teach 7 sections<br />\nof \"French Elements,\" 8 sections of \"Intermediate French,\"<br />\n3 sections of \"Advanced Intermediate French,\" 5 sections of<br />\n\"Conversation et Composition,\"<br />\nand 1 section of \"French for<br />\nReading and Translation.\" In the<br />\npast, those courses have been<br />\ntaught almost exclusively by<br />\ngraduate students and Laurence<br />\nSelim. As of right now, there are<br />\nno teaching assistants in French<br />\nother than the graduate students.<br />\nI'm sure the administration has a<br />\nplan. It'd be nice to know what<br />\nit is.<br />\nIt might seem that a university<br />\nwith Hopkins' prestige would<br />\nhave little trouble hiring new professors. Unfortunately, it's not<br />\nthat simple. First of all, the (artificial, to my mind) budget crisis<br />\nwhich precipitated the problem<br />\nhas in no way abated, and this is<br />\ncommon knowledge among<br />\nacademicians. The scandalous<br />\nsituation at Hopkins has been<br />\nwell-publicized in academic<br />\ncircles throughout the country, if<br />\nnot at Hopkins itself(at least not<br />\nin the school newspaper).

Wasps are<br />\nsmall, too, but I once missed a<br />\nweek-long waterski trip up to<br />\nLake George because one of them<br />\nbit me.<br />\n\"Second, I would like to share<br />\nwith you some of the best advice<br />\nI've ever had, which was, oddly<br />\nenough, the only advice Kurt<br />\nVonnegut's father ever gave him.<br />\nThis was 'Never stick anything in<br />\nyour ear. The tiniest bones in<br />\nyour body are inside your ears,<br />\nyou know\u2014and your sense of<br />\nbalance, too. If you mess around<br />\nwith your ears, you could not only become deaf, but you could<br />\nstart falling down all the time.'<br />\n\u2014If you start to take something<br />\ncompletely seriously, it means<br />\nyou're losing.' The corollary to<br />\nthis rule is 'If all else fails, tell<br />\na joke.' Telling a joke is like a<br /><br />\nsystems check for humans; it<br />\nmeans that our memory is still intact, it restores nervous energy<br />\nand waning fight reflexes (there's<br />\nnothing a person fights so hard to<br />\nget as a laugh), and it's a taste<br />\ncheck. That is, provided you<br />\nknow whether or not to laugh. If<br />\nyou don't know if a joke is funny, you probably have already<br />\nstarted wearing print ties on plaid<br />\nsuits.<br />\n\"Recently, I have learned,<br />\nresearchers have unearthed what<br />\nappears to be the missing<br />\nbeatitude. Translated from an ancient scroll, it reads, 'Blessed are<br />\nthose who are involved in a relationship in which both people feel<br />\ncompletely comfortable with the<br />\nparameters they have set and<br />\nwhich their friends do not find<br />\nunhealthy for one of the involved members, for one set of<br />\nparents shall hate the other family entirely.' I think this means<br />\nsomething.<br /><br />\n\"Never drink orange juice just<br />\nafter you've brushed your teeth.<br />\n\"And lastly, I offer you what I<br />\nconsider the top four of my 'Good<br />\nIdeas in General.' One, Never<br />\nTake Anything For Granted, as<br />\nmissed<br />\nprobably<br />\nyou've<br />\nsomething. Two, Where Possible, Plead Ignorance and Apathy<br />\nEven If You Know Better\u2014you'll<br />\nstay out of trouble. Three, Never<br />\nSacrifice Comfort for Fashion,<br />\nfor you'll always look better and<br />\nfeel happier if you are comfortable. Four, Never Sacrifice<br />\nFashion for Comfort, for you can<br />\nnever be happy with yourself<br />\nunless you look good to yourself,<br />\nand besides, you should appear<br />\nsocially circumspect at all times.<br />\n\"That is the completest list of<br />\neverything that I am 'sure' of<br />\napart from the fact that I am not<br />\nsure of anything and I wish I<br />\ncould stop thinking about it.

Consumerism tells that in<br />\norder to be whole people, fulfilled and content, we need to fortify ourselves again and again<br />\nwith purchased products. We are<br />\npart of a culture that consumes<br />\nand wastes endlessly, and the<br />\npsychological, social, and environmental effects have not gone<br />\nunnoticed. In addition, advertising commonly promotes sexism,<br />\nracism, and the perpetuation of<br />\nstereotypes.<br />\nOur school should be very<br />\ncareful in its support of<br />\nideologies. The display ads are<br />\ndangerous not only for the consumerist ideology that they<br />\nuphold, but also because this very<br />\n(insidious) agenda is disguised by<br />\nvisual appeal.<br />\nWe feel that the administrators<br />\nresponsible have not given this<br />\nissue adequate consideration. At<br />\na time when so much is going on<br />\nfor students and administrators<br />\nwho respond to their needs, it is<br />\neasy to overlook such seemingly<br />\nbenign objects as these two<br />\ndisplay boards.

Response to the<br />\nStudents for Environmental Action's efforts to bring about<br />\nrecycling has been outstanding.<br />\nThe success of the campus-wide<br />\naluminum-recycling program<br />\n(which now brings in over 200<br />\npounds of aluminum weekly) and<br />\nthe tremendous volume of glass,<br />\npaper, and tin dropped off at the<br />\nshed behind AMR I each week<br />\nserves as a clear illustration that<br />\nwe all share an eagerness to be<br />\nresponsible and less wasteful. As<br /><br />\na result, there are excellent indications that this fall will bring<br />\nUniversity-operated campus-wide<br />\nrecycling of white paper, glass,<br />\naluminum.<br />\nand<br />\nPlease use these containers all<br />\nthe time. Make a new habit of<br />\nrecycling white paper. Think of<br />\nhow much white paper is thrown<br />\naway on campus every day! If<br />\nyou are presented with the opportunity, buy recycled paper.<br />\nRecycling means even more<br />\nwhen you purchase recycled<br />\nproducts.<br />\nOver the summer SEA will be<br />\nrecycling on a scaled-down basis.<br />\nThe shed will be closed for<br />\nbusiness. Please take the good<br />\nhabits you've learned this<br />\nsemester to heart. The purpose of<br />\nSEA's efforts is to make recycl-<br /><br />\ning as convenient as possible<br />\nwhen possible, but it is also to<br />\neducate people about doing the<br />\nright thing on their own. If you<br />\nwill be in Charles Village, there<br />\nis a \"roll-off\" at the Farmer's<br />\nMarket located at 33rd and<br />\nBarclay Streets, where you can<br />\nbring your aluminum, glass, and<br />\ntin every Saturday from 8 a.m.<br />\nto noon. If you are at home, make<br />\nan effort to find a place nearby<br />\nto recycle.

We hope that<br />\nthe administration acts conscientiously and removes these<br />\ndisplays.<br /><br />\nlong ago, I heard a professor asked what the feeling was among<br />\nthe faculty regarding the FiveYear Plan; he said the question<br />\neveryone was asking one another<br />\nwas \"What's your latest offer?\"<br />\nThis sort of crisis atmosphere is<br />\nsimply not conducive to a stable<br />\nfaculty. And for the same reasons<br />\nthat professors generally don't<br />\nwant to stay at universities where<br />\nthey are not provided with sufficient financial and moral support<br />\nby the administration, professors<br />\ngenerally don't want to move to<br />\nsuch universities. Second, there<br />\nare just not that many senior professors of French out there. And<br />\nto hire assistant professors (or,<br />\nworse still, visiting assistant professor) to replace tenured full<br />\nand associate professors is to risk<br />\na significant loss of prestige<br />\n(which unfortunately, counts for<br />\nquite a hit in the grad school<br /><br />\nbusiness). Unfortunately, the<br />\ndepartment doesn't have much<br />\nchoice at this point. Third, searches for new professors usually<br />\nhave to begin at least one year<br />\nahead of time. Because the chairmanship of the department was in<br />\ndoubt until this spring, such<br />\nsearches were late in getting<br />\nunder way, through no fault of<br />\nthe current chair, Professor<br />\nAnderson. This is why the<br />\ndepartment is basically taking the<br />\nnext year off. Though the two remaining tenured professors\u2014<br />\nand<br />\nDefaux<br />\nProfessors<br />\nAnderson\u2014are excellent, they<br />\ncan't be expected to do<br />\neverything alone.<br />\nThe upshot of all this is that the<br />\nHopkins French Department is in<br />\nfor some tough times. Although<br />\nthis is not the first time that the<br />\nFrench Department has had to en<br />\ndure such a mass departure<br />\n(why?), each time it takes several<br />\nyears to recover and the quality<br /><br />\nof education in French inevitably<br />\nsuffers. Several years may be a<br />\nshort time in the life of an institution hut, for most of us, it's the<br />\nlength of an education. And even<br />\nthough the breakdown of a<br />\nFrench Department seemingly affects only those who are interested in French and French<br />\nliterature, it is an extremely inauspicious sign if it turns out that<br />\nthe University is willing to<br />\nsacrifice whole departments if<br />\nneed be in the name of a FiveYear Plan and a gratuitously imposed policy of budgetary decentralization. One wonders what the<br />\nadministration's priorities are.<br />\nI suppose it's too much to ask<br />\nthe News-Letter reporters who<br />\ncannot even figure out what is<br />\nhappening, to then go and investigate why. But an answer to<br />\nthat question\u2014\"Why is the<br />\nFrench Department falling<br />\napart?\"\u2014is both urgently needed and long overdue.<br /><br />\nTravel<br />\n\u2022Air Line Tickets\u2022Amtrak \u2022International Experts\u2022Tour Package.; Cruises\u2022Free Vi.?.Club \u2022 SpecialJHU Department<br />\n\u2022<br />\nAmtrak<br />\n\u2022<br />\nTickets<br />\nPrograms \u2022 Discounts for over 13,000 Hotel Properties Worldwide \u2022 Discounied Car Rental \u2022,Air Line<br />\nfor<br />\nInternational Experts\u2022 Tour Packages Cruises \u2022Free V.I.P.

Stewart<br />\nOne of the godfathers of the<br />\nearly '80s L.A. punk scene, John<br />\nDoe of the band X,once remarked that the reason for leaving his<br />\nhometown was the city's complete disinterest in new music.<br />\nThat city was Baltimore. To hear<br />\nhim talk, one imagines a scene<br />\ncomposed entirely of Lynrd<br />\nSkynrd cover bands with an occasional imitation-English synthpop group for contrast.<br />\nDoe wasn't alone in his disdain<br />\nfor Baltimore's indigenous<br />\nmusic. David Byrne and Frank<br />\nZappa were among the more<br />\nfamous musicians to split Charm<br />\nCity and make tracks for the more<br />\nfertile music scenes in New York<br />\nand Los Angeles. Sandwiched<br />\nbetween Philadelphia and the<br />\ncapital, and with New York a<br />\nshort two hours by train,<br />\nBaltimoreans who were serious<br />\nabout music saw little point in<br />\nsticking around trying to buck the<br />\nsmall town system, and moved<br />\nout. The happening scenes<br />\nthroughout the past ten years<br />\nwere in places like Boston,<br />\nHollywood, Seattle. and Athens,<br />\nGeorgia. Even Cleveland managed to generate good press.<br />\nBaltimore might be a good place<br />\nto get started, went the<br />\nthinking\u2014no pressure, accessible<br />\nvenues, lots of players\u2014but no<br />\none ever got famous playing<br />\nthere.<br />\nHow much this attitude has<br />\nreally changed in recent years is<br />\nimpossible to say. What has<br />\nchanged is the quality of music<br />\nbeing heard about the city.<br />\nGroups like Rhumba Club,<br />\nMonkeyspank, The Unknown,<br />\nand The Almighty Senators have<br />\nbeen attracting consistently large<br />\nand enthusiastic audiences,<br />\nas well as some major label attention. Some, like Rhumba Club,<br />\nhave already released albums,<br />\nwhile others either have releases<br />\non the way or are in the process<br />\nof recording. Nor are these few<br />\nalone. A host of promising<br /><br />\nyounger bands have been springing up like weeds, filling out<br />\nalready impressive local bills and<br />\ndrawing new crowds.<br />\nThe city's nascent music community seems to thrive on diversity, and one of its most diverse<br />\nnew groups is the sextet known<br />\nas the False Face Society. A<br />\nmixed group of males and<br />\nfemales, white and black, False<br />\nFace plays the music of its six<br />\nwriters in a style which might be<br />\ndescribed roughly as a kind of<br />\npan-global funk\u2014America meets<br />\nAfrica by way of the Caribbean,<br />\nperhaps. Understanding the<br />\nmusic's appeal, however, is<br />\nsimply a matter of listening.<br />\nIn an interview done a week<br />\nbefore their performance at the<br />\nHopkins Spring Fair, we had the<br />\nopportunity to discuss, amongst<br />\nother things, the city's club scene,<br />\nthe pros and cons of the so-called<br />\n\"world beat\" movement in<br />\npopular music, the segregation of<br />\nradio, and some of the band's<br />\nplans for the future.<br />\nGenesis<br />\nThe False Face Society\u2014Rob<br />\nWhite (percussion); Sheryl Bailey<br />\n(guitar, vocals); Steven Berson<br />\n(bass, vocals, percussion); Anne<br />\nX. Hairston (drums, percussion);<br />\nWarren Boes (guitar, vocals); and<br />\nShirle Hale (vocals, bass, percussion)\u2014sprang into being officially<br />\nin September 1989, minus Rob<br />\nWhite, who joined the group after<br />\nmeeting Berson during this year's<br />\nArtscape festival.<br />\nPrevious versions of the band<br />\nplayed in Boston while five of the<br />\nsix members (all but White) earned degrees at the Berklee School<br />\nof Musk, which has produced<br />\nsome of the decade's best (and<br />\nworst) jazz musicians.<br />\nPlaying Boston's clubs was<br />\nsomething less than a pleasant experience, however. Boston<br />\naudiences tend to maintain their<br />\ndistance, projecting an air of icy<br />\ndetachment in the face of the<br />\nfunkiest musical assaults. Worse,<br />\nBeantown club owners commonly<br /><br />\nuse a sort of quota system to<br />\ndetermine which group, out of the<br />\ntwo or three they might book in<br />\na night, has the greatest number<br />\nof(paying) fans. You don't pay<br />\nto play so much as you pay to<br />\nplay ever again. The result, accordingly, is rivalry, paranoia,<br />\nanxiety, and various other kinds<br />\nof bad karma. Boston was not all<br />\nit was supposed to be. Certainly,<br />\nit was not the place to be.<br />\nThat dissatisfaction led in part<br />\nto the move south. Hairston was<br />\nthe first to move down, taking up<br />\nresidence in D.C. after<br />\ngraduating in 1988. The following June, with the encouragement<br />\nof Berson's childhood friend Mitchell Vaillant, percussionist with<br />\nThe Almighty Senators, Hale,<br />\nBerson, and Boes took the<br />\nplunge.<br />\nThey liked what they found\u2014<br />\na lower cost of living and a<br />\nviable, less uptight music<br />\nscene\u2014and it wasn't long<br />\nthereafter that Bailey made the<br />\nmove as well. Bailey, who with<br />\nBerson manages to make a living<br />\nas a musician, called Hairston<br />\nbefore coming down: \"Sheryl<br />\ncalls me up and asks, 'If I came<br />\nto D.C. do you think I could get<br />\nsome work and play?' Needless<br />\nto say, I silently screamed, 'Get<br />\nyour butt down here!\"<br />\nThe Charm of Charm City<br />\nThe move seems to have suited<br />\neveryone involved, at least in<br />\nterms of their music's reception.<br />\n\"People in Baltimore come out<br />\nto listen to good music, and if<br />\nthey like what they hear, they'll<br />\nbe back,\" claims White. Boes<br />\nagrees, adding with a touch of<br />\nirony, \"And they'll dance, too.<br />\nPeople like to dance around<br />\nhere.\" Dealing with clubs has<br />\nproven less difficult, as well.<br />\nChambers, a small club downtown<br />\non Bourbon Street, is one of their<br />\nfavorites. It features a relaxed atmosphere in which to perform<br />\nand a crisp, modern sound<br />\nsystem. Berson likens it to playing one's living room: \"You<br /><br />\nFrom Warped Minds...<br />\nby Cristian Tampe<br /><br />\n(k7<br /><br />\n3<br />\nft%<br /><br />\nTh.fts<br /><br />\nme.<br /><br />\n\"Pick-Me-Up\" Bouquets<br /><br />\nFilms in Brief<br />\nby Mark Friedman<br />\nPretty Woman<br />\nIf one ignores the rather disturbing ground situation of Garry<br />\nMarshall's latest comedy, there's<br />\na charming modern-day fairy tale<br />\nbrushing its locks underneath. Vivian (Julia Roberts) is not even<br />\nclassy enough to be a call girl\u2014<br />\nshe's nothing more than a cheap<br />\nhooker with a sense of humor.<br />\nCorporate raider Edward Louis<br />\n(Richard Gere) asks her for directions and ends up hiring her for<br />\nthe week, breaking down his<br />\nMBA-world into digestible prostitute parts.

Smiling because I had enjoyed the film thoroughly,<br />\nthoughtful because it had shown<br />\nme things I hadn't seen before,<br />\nand dazed because it was a<br />\nbeautiful, complex work to experience. The film draws you in<br />\nwith its warmth and humor, then<br />\ndeals out it themes\u2014religion and<br />\nits interpretation, love among<br />\nfriends, and personal sacrifice\u2014<br />\nwith the gentle strokes of an artist's brush.<br />\nIn the film, Daniel Coulombe<br />\n(Lothaire Bluteau) is an experimental actor who happens<br />\nupon the idea to enact the Passion<br />\nPlay, a performance of the gospel<br />\nthat describes the life, death, and<br />\nrebirth of Jesus. But his concept<br />\nis unorthodox: he wants to perform it on the grounds of a church<br />\nin the mountains overlooking<br />\nMontreal. And rather than performing on a stage, Coulombe wants<br />\nto alter the surrounding landscape<br />\nso that it resembles the ancient<br />\nMiddle East, and then conduct the<br />\naudience through it.<br />\nWhat's more, his version of the<br />\nplay is an interpretation that<br />\nviews Jesus as a prophet but also as<br />\nthe natural son of Mary and a<br />\nRoman Soldier. He draws around<br />\nhim four other actors who share<br />\nin his vision; as they practice and<br />\nperform, their friendship grows.<br />\nTheir play, in the meantime,<br />\nbecomes all the rage in Montreal,<br />\nand crowds of all kinds come to<br />\nexperience the Gospel coming<br />\nalive in front of them. The conflict begins when conservative<br />\nforces from the Roman Catholic<br />\nchurch decide that Coulombe's<br />\nversion strays too far from what<br />\nthey want to see. The controversy soon escalates to a point of<br />\ncrisis and of violence; in the process, Coulombe and his troupe<br />\nslowly reproduce in their own<br />\nlives the Gospel story that they<br />\nperform each night before an<br />\naudience.<br />\nThe situation is intriguing from<br />\nthe start, and director Denys Arcand fills his landscapes\u2014real<br />\nand Biblical\u2014with a wealth of<br />\ncharacters ranging from the<br />\ncharismatic to the just plain<br />\nsleazy. With his long, peaceful<br /><br />\nface, Bluteau cuts a striking<br />\nfigure as Jesus. As the actor, one<br />\nbelieves him as the loving, inspired, and unusally driven young<br />\nartist; as Jesus, it isn't much of<br />\na stretch to see him healing the<br />\nblind and walking on water.<br />\nBluteau carries a gently intense<br />\nmanner that makes him a powerful central figure around which to<br />\ncontruct a film.<br />\nOther performance are equally good. Coulombe's comrades<br />\nare each very different, but all are<br />\nbelievable in their real and<br />\nBiblical manifestations. From the<br />\nyoung Canadian model who is<br />\nsearching for herself to the<br />\nstaunch older actor who upholds<br />\nCoulombe's vision in the face ot<br />\ngrowing opposition.<br />\nArcand also adorns his world<br />\nwith a variety of smaller<br />\ncharacters which, although less<br />\ncrucial to the tone of the film, are<br />\ndelightful and well performed.<br />\nThere is the sleazy young lawyer<br />\nwho wants to help Coulombe<br />\n\"take the city\" with his popularity; the googly eyed guard of the<br />\nchurchgrounds; the cynical,<br />\nhedonistic advertising director;<br />\nand the spastic radio talk-show<br />\nhostess.<br />\nAs with most of \"Jesus of<br />\nMontreal,\" it is Arcand's light<br />\ntouch, particularly with comedy,<br />\nthat allows this all to work. In one<br />\nscene Coulombe has an interview<br />\nwith a psychiatrist appointed by<br />\nthe state, who reports that he is<br />\nmore sane than anyone within the<br />\ngovernment itself. In another,<br />\ntwo dancers audition for a beer<br />\ncommercial in which they sing<br />\nlyrics of near-idolatry to the product they are hawking.<br />\nIn several instances, the rupture<br />\nbetween play and reality leads to<br />\nhumorous consequences, as profane and sacred worlds intrude<br />\nupon one another. At one point,<br />\npolice inspectors approach<br />\nJesus/Coulombe on the crucifix,<br />\na disciple quotes Hamlet's soliloquy, and audience members run<br />\nforward and embrace Coulombe<br />\nto \"save\" him. At another point<br />\nin the film, the actors interpret the<br />\nPassion Play in various theatrical<br />\ngenres: comedic francais, New<br />\nYork method acting, and Kabuki.<br />\nThroughout, Arcand creates a<br />\nmood that is stunning to experience. We see Coulombe on<br />\nthe crucifix at night, overlooking<br /><br />\n\"two<br /><br />\nthe flickering lights of Montreal.<br />\nWe find ourselves over deep blue<br />\ncityscapes with piercing, sweet<br />\nguitar music in the background.<br />\nIn the Passion Play scenes, there<br />\nis an aura of magic: amid the<br />\nwhirring of birds and orange light<br />\nof torches, we see Jesus walking<br />\non water and handing out bread<br />\nto the chanting of hymns. And we<br />\nare there as the audience as well,<br />\nhard-pressed to separate the actors from the Biblical roles they<br />\nplay.<br />\n\"Jesus of Montreal\" has its<br />\nfaults, however, and there are occasional gaps in an otherwise integrated fabric. These occur<br />\nwhen Arcand is too overbearing<br />\nwith his theme\u2014when he sets<br />\ndown his paintbrushes and picks<br />\nup rubber mallets instead. In one<br />\nscene, for example, a formerly<br />\nhard-nosed priest buckles under,<br />\nrevealing too suddenly the deep<br />\ninsecurities he has about his faith.<br />\nReligion, he says with no consistency, is not about truth, but<br />\nabout delusion: delusion of the<br />\nsad, the lonely, and the lost. True<br />\nor not, his speech is<br />\nunconvincing.<br />\nIn another heavy-handed scene,<br />\na delirious Coulombe gives a<br />\nlong, surreal speech in a subway<br />\nstation, wandering from person to<br />\nintently listening person, none of<br />\nwhom shun him, run away, or go<br />\nfor help. It's not that either of<br />\nthese scenes is terrible, only that<br />\nin a piece as natural as this one,<br />\nthey seem unusually staged and<br />\nartifical.<br />\nDespite these heavy handed<br />\nepisodes, however, \"Jesus of<br />\nMontreal\" is a film to be commended. For as Coulombe is<br />\ndrawn along his journey into the<br />\nsymbolic world of Biblical<br />\nteaching, so are we. \"Jesus of<br />\nMontreal\" is in many ways an<br />\nEaster film, but it doesn't suffer<br />\na few weeks after the fact. The<br />\nlessons it has to teach, of love and<br />\npersonal sacrifice, have been<br />\naround far longer than that, with<br />\nno ill effects.<br />\n\"Jesus of Montreal\" will be<br />\nshown at the Baltimore Museum<br />\nofArt Saturday, April 28, at 9:45<br />\np.m., as part of the Baltimore<br />\nFilm Festival.

Park<br />\nJust one of life's little ironies,<br />\nI guess, that this derivative,<br />\npretentious, predictably bombastic \"rock fable\" (reportedly<br />\nthe first) should come from the<br />\nsame mind that scored the PBS<br />\nseries \"The Brain.\" Or maybe<br />\nnot, for this is also the mind<br />\nwhich scored the soporific \"9\u00bd<br />\nWeeks,\" \"Children of the<br />\nCorn,\" and Cheech and Chong's<br />\n\"Rude Awakening.\" The mind<br />\n(and talent) in question is<br />\nJonathan Elias, a classically<br />\ntrained pianist who, movies<br />\naside, also produced quite competently the last albums by Grace<br />\nJones and Duran Duran. Like<br />\nSting before him, however, Elias<br />\nhas let his ambition get the better of him, allowing more ideas,<br />\nconcepts, and good intentions to<br />\nsuffice for basic songwriting<br />\ncraft.<br />\nThe concept here is the plight<br />\nof the American Indian and his<br />\nculture, which Elias seems to feel<br />\nis being subsumed into<br />\nmainstream America to ill effect.<br />\nTo illustrate this slow decay Elias<br />\nhas written an allegorical story<br />\nwherein the citizenry of an<br />\nisolated American Indian village<br />\nare robbed of their souls by a<br />\nmysterious photographer, the<br />\nShadow Catcher from The Lost<br />\nWorld. The sanctity of the race<br />\ncan only be restored by the (what<br />\nelse) elder lhala, a wise shaman<br />\nwho had warned his people of the<br />\nShadow Catcher's threat in the<br />\nfirst place. It is he who must<br />\njourney to the Lost World and<br />\nrecover the frozen souls by<br />\nsacrificing himself.<br />\nThis is the idea, anyway. To<br />\nhelp him realize these deeply personal visions (inspired by \"The<br />\nLife and Times of a Shadow Cat-<br /><br />\ncher,\" a series of pictorialist<br />\nworks by Edward Curtis), Elias<br />\nhas surrounded himself with a<br />\ncoterie of his best celebrity<br />\nfriends. It's the type of supercasting which usually counts<br />\nmore for names than talent. So it<br />\nis that we find amongst \"Requiem' 's dozens of studio musicians legendary performers like<br />\nJon Anderson, Jon Waite, John<br />\nTaylor, Simon LeBon, Nick<br />\nRhodes, Grace Jones, Michael<br />\nBolton, Stewart Copeland, Susanna Hoffs, ad nauseam. The only<br />\nsurprise is that U2 or Bruce<br />\nSpringsteen or Bruce Hornsby<br />\ndidn't show up.<br />\nThe late Jim Morrison also<br />\nmakes an appearance in the form<br />\nof poetry readings, reputedly<br />\nrecorded shortly before his death<br />\nand recently released by his<br />\nestate, which Elias sets to music<br />\non \"The Journey\" and \"The<br />\nChant Movement.\" This last is<br />\nthe strongest cut on the album,<br />\nwith its weird, buzzing chanting<br />\n(provided by Jones, Liam<br />\nO'Maunlai, and The Boys Choir<br />\nof Harlem) and tense, charged<br />\nelectronics recalling HaightAshbury as much as they do a<br />\nDakota plain. Taken out of context, Morrison's verse is quite<br />\nlame, but couched as it is here<br />\namidst the primal, pseudo-mystic<br />\ntrappings, lines like \"I know the<br />\nimpossible sea when the dogs<br />\nbark\" seem right at home. Certainly one for the Doors fanatic.<br />\nOther high points include Toni<br />\nChilds' unforgettable, throaty<br />\nphrasings on \"I've Not Forgotten You.\" When she calls \"take<br />\nme back/take me back,\" you will<br />\nget chills. \"Follow in My<br />\nFootsteps,\" the LP's poppiest<br />\ntrack, is also quite nice, though<br />\nto my ears it sounds more like an<br />\nouttake from Peter Gabriel's<br />\n\"So\" than a Native American entreaty for solidarity; Susanna<br />\nHoff's backing vocal corn-<br /><br />\nFILMS, from 7<br />\nLarry Ferguson and Mark<br />\nStewart) hangs Connery out to<br />\ndry. Ramius is neither glorified<br />\nnor pathetic: he just drifts<br />\nsomewhere in between. Simply<br />\nput, all the elements that make<br />\n\"The Hunt for Red October\"<br />\nsuch a satisfying read\u2014gritty<br />\ndetails of docking collars and propulsion systems\u2014don't translate.<br />\nPerhaps this atrocious film will<br />\nmark not only the end of the Cold<br />\nWar but also the extinction of the<br />\ntechnothriller, the monster of the<br />\nun-literature that Clancy himself<br />\ncreated.<br /><br />\nJonathan Elias<br />\nplements Simon LeBon's in much<br />\nthe same way Kate Bush's did<br />\nGabriel's on \"Don't Give Up.\"<br />\nIndeed, it's a problem throughout<br />\nmuch of \"Requiem.\" Where<br />\nElias seeks Amerindian authenticity and atmosphere, he appropriates/plunders many of the<br />\ncross-cultural melodic and<br />\npolyrhythmic nuances Gabriel explored on his first two albums,<br />\nand more recently on \"Passion.\"<br />\nWhen Elias isn't doing this, he<br />\njust lets his synthesizers soar in<br />\ndirectionless,<br />\nthough<br />\na<br />\nundeniably majestic-sounding,<br />\nmorass of melody.<br />\nThe rest of the songs, while not<br />\nquite throwaway, are filled with<br />\na certain cloying pomposity<br />\nreminiscent of early Yes, Rush,<br />\nand Pink Floyd. Jon Anderson,<br />\nwho is featured prominentl,. on<br />\ntwo songs, must have felt right at<br />\nhome. I found it just plain<br />\nlaughable. It doesn't help either<br />\nthat the \"mystic,\" juvenile lyrics<br />\noften make only passing<br />\nreference to the \"story\" at hand.<br />\nNot surprisingly, the album's<br />\nworst, most embarrassing<br />\nmoments come when it takes<br />\nitself most seriously, as in part<br />\ntwo of \"Far Far Cry,\u2014 the<br /><br />\nJacob Getz<br /><br />\nhighly programmable (and MORish) first single, wherein Michael<br />\nBolton and Pattie Darcy<br />\neviscerate any notions of sincerity<br />\nwith their completely overblown<br />\n\"soulful\" wailing. Just as bad is<br />\nthe closer, \"Father and Son,\"<br />\nwhere Martin and Charlie Sheen,<br />\ntrying atrociously hard to sound<br />\nlike gods, read adapted<br />\nAlgonkian/Sioux/Arapahoe/Pai<br />\nute poetry which has lost much<br />\nin translation.<br />\nIn the end, Elias just does not<br />\nserve his theme. The inevitable<br />\ncollusion and misappropriation of<br />\ncultures in this country is surely<br />\na worthy, universal subject, but<br />\nthe smug self-righteousness with<br />\nwhich Elias orchestrates his minidramas never allows his songs to<br />\nrise above mere nonsense. About<br />\nthe only thing worthy about this<br />\nalbum is that it's also a benefit<br />\nproject. Proceeds from the sales<br />\nwill be contributed to the Save the<br />\nChildren foundation, which<br />\nworks with over 60 American Indian tribes to help combat the<br />\ngrowing problems of drug and<br />\nalcohol abuse and suicide among<br />\nNative American youth.

Hale's \"Remember<br />\nThis Feeling,\" for example,<br />\nfeatures a long, evocative poem<br />\nset to a Senegalese rhythm called the \"Manjanii,\" while<br />\nHariston's \"Decisions\" echoes<br />\nSouth African styles with its<br />\nmassed female vocals and terse<br />\n6/8 time signature. Asked to draw<br />\nup a group list of influences, the<br />\nMahotella Queens, Fela Kuti,<br />\nTito Puente, Cecil Taylor, and<br />\nNusrat Fateh Ali Khan appear<br />\nwith the same regularity as Led<br />\nZeppelin, XTC, Trouble Funk,<br />\nand Patti Smith. The list offers a<br />\nkind of template for the False<br />\nFace Sound, a sound that holds<br />\nrhythm as its source and center.<br />\n\"Within a tune, we start out with<br />\nthe rhythm, and everything else<br />\npretty much takes of itself,\" says<br />\nBerson. \"A lot of these rhythms,<br />\neven though they're in twelve or<br />\nsix or five, [the question] ends<br />\nup, 'Well, does it groove or<br />\nnot?\"<br />\nJazz Police<br />\nA high level of instrumental<br />\nproficiency is one of Berklee's<br />\ntrademarks, and is one of the factors that separates the False Face<br />\nfrom much of the Baltimore local<br />\ntalent. Not surprisingly, the<br />\npresent version of the group has,<br />\non occasion, received some grief<br />\nfor being \"a Berklee band.\" Hale<br /><br />\nexplains the attitude as, \"You're<br />\nprofessionals\u2014why aren't you in<br />\nNew York?\" Such reverse snobbery has little pretext. False Face<br />\nmusic is more about ensemble interaction; the improvisation tends<br />\nto be collective and often, as the<br />\nmembers will admit, accidental.<br />\nThe technique is there, it just isn't<br />\nthe point.<br />\nThe future<br />\nPlans are in the works for the<br />\nrecording of a professional fouror five-song EP. Local studios are<br />\nto be scrutinized, record iabels to<br />\nbe approached.<br />\nFormatted radio may be the<br />\nFalse Face Society's biggest impediment to radio airplay. Their<br />\ncross-pollinated sound, mixing<br />\nabrasive guitars with heavy percussion and odd time signatures,<br />\nis not likely to find favor with<br />\ngenre-minded programmers.<br />\nCiting Album Oriented Radio(or<br />\nas one member jokes, Apartheid<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nOriented) stations' confusion with<br />\nthe idea of a black rock band<br />\n(Living Color), Hairston asks,<br />\n\"If those guys had problems [getting airplay]. . . where the hell<br />\nwould we be played?\" Nor are<br />\nthey likely to be embraced by<br />\n\"Urban Contemporary\" stations.<br />\nThey wouldn't play Living Color, either.

The bizarre story of<br />\n\"Max and Wells,\" which Watt<br />\nintroduced as being \"bout waking up in the mall. . . and getting<br />\nthe fuck out,\" was another rather<br />\ncomical new song. A stupendous<br />\nset of many diverse styles, all<br />\nbearing the unique flREHOSE<br />\nsound.<br />\nMy encounter with the band<br />\nwas far stranger: a scheduling<br />\nmixup sent me to the band's tour<br />\nvan for a brief interview before<br />\nthe show. We piled into their<br />\nFord Econoline 250, sat on the<br />\nfront seat and chatted with the<br />\nband. Parts of the conversation<br />\nscarcely resemble an interview at<br />\nall: the band began by asking for<br /><br />\nR<br /><br />\nthankless jobs just as seriously as they<br />\nshould, and didn't hesitate to call at 2:00<br />\nam\u2014thanks, guys\u2014when there was any<br />\nquestion about the spelling al an obscure<br />\nlead guitarist's name.<br />\nThe News-Letter photo staff--in particular Michael Blumhardt, John Misa,<br />\nElisse Takara, and Donna Williamson\u2014<br />\nsuffered through reams of photos: sorry<br />\nmusicians, poorly lighted movie sets, Ninja Turtles, even a writer with a dirty<br />\nbaseball cap.

True enough,<br />\nthe band's albums are made with<br />\nblinding speed: they've all been<br />\ncranked out in forty hours or so,<br />\nwith very few exceptions. This<br />\ninformation is proudly displayed<br />\non each flREHOSE album.<br />\nClaims Wyatt,\"I put those things<br />\nthere to inspire other dudes,<br />\n'cause I wish somebody would<br />\nhave done it for me when I was<br />\na kid.

If you<br />\nwon't be in the city, change your<br />\nplans. The band is still playing<br />\nevery week, despite Mel's unfortunate death a few months ago,<br />\nbut no one knows how long they<br />\nwill continue. Alto saxophonist<br />\nDick Oatts promised me they will<br />\nstay together as long as possible,<br />\nbut that time frame is nebulous in<br />\nthe world of jazz.<br />\nThe Mel Lewis Orchestra is an<br />\naberration on the jazz scene. His<br />\nbig band is one of few that plays<br />\nnew and contemporary music,<br />\nrather than repertory pieces,<br />\nguaranteeing that the charts<br />\nalways have a fresh sound. Each<br />\nperformance glistens with the<br />\nenergy and ability of a refined<br />\nband which is creating their own<br />\nmusic rather than rehashing what<br />\nothers have played. In addition,<br />\neach player is a capable soloist<br />\nwith the ability to bring an audience to tears. The focus,<br /><br />\nIts leader may be<br />\ndead, but the Mel<br />\nLewis Orchestra lives<br />\non\u2014for now<br />\nhowever, remains on the ensemble work. What's the point of a<br />\nbig band if the only arrangement<br />\nis a 32-bar melody filled in with<br />\ncombo-style solos'?<br />\nMel Lewis's last album with<br />\nthe Jazz Orchestra, \"The<br />\nDefinitive Thad Jones,\" captures<br />\nboth the fresh essence of Mel's<br />\nbig band and the compositional<br /><br />\nARTSMAN<br /><br />\nThere is always a risk in stepping down<br />\nfrom the Trojan Horse of editorial<br />\nanonymity and speaking in humane tones.<br />\nIt invites writers and production workers<br />\nto step on your ideas in the future; it shatters the tenuous image of the editorial<br />\ngodhead; and worst of all, to quote Bernard Shaw, \"It frightens the horses in the<br />\nstreet.''<br />\nStill, this year's Arts section would<br />\nnever have come together in the way it did<br />\nwithout the help of a small, enthusiastic<br />\ncore of people with a formidable range of<br />\ntalents. They deserve to be acknowledged.<br />\nFirst and omnipresent was the NewsLetter staff as a whole, which never<br />\nfailed to inform (repeatedly and with glee)<br />\nwhen something looked stupid on the<br />\npage, or even when it sounded that vv.ay<br />\nas an idea.<br />\nBoth Jonathan Engler and Ely Brown,<br />\non the other hand, were eminently permissive and supportive. Their ridicule.<br />\nwhen it did come, always appeared in the<br />\nguise of constructive criticism. Chris<br />\nVandeKieft and Jack Lifkin took their<br /><br />\nEC<br /><br />\nadvice about cutting down a<br />\nseventy-foot palm tree in<br />\nHurley's front yard.<br />\nElsewhere, the garrulous Wyatt<br />\noffered information about things<br />\nlike<br />\nhis conception of<br />\nsongwriting: \"We want to lead<br />\nyou by the nose. You make up<br />\nyour mind about what we're saying. We put a lot of little spots in<br />\nthe universe, and let you tie it all<br />\ntogether. Well, I like to leave a<br />\nlittle more space in between the<br />\nplanets. Or stars, whatever.\"<br />\nThe band lists sources as varied<br />\nas Blue Oyster Cult, the Who,<br />\nJames Taylor, and Chuck D of<br />\nPublic Enemy as musical influence and band favorites. But<br />\nWatt claims that the band, selftaught players who learned while<br />\nactually in bands and without<br />\nlistening to many other records,<br />\nis largely its own creation. \"The<br />\ninfluence don't make a whole lot<br />\nof difference,\" claims Watt.<br />\n\"Once you take it into your own<br />\nhands, it's your own experiences.<br />\nThat's the battlefield.

The five pieces on<br />\nthe album are the current renditions of five Jones pieces from the<br />\norchestra's repetoire. The arrangements are true to the<br />\noriginals, with only slight<br />\nmodifications of Lewis's in the<br />\nbackground figures and tempos.<br />\nThe changes reflect the evolving<br />\nnature of the orchestra, and subtly<br />\nprevent it from becoming a repertory band of its own works.<br />\nThere are a number of<br />\nhighlights on \"The Definitive<br />\nThad Jones.\" \"Three in One\" is<br />\na grooving swinger (in 4/4 time)<br />\nfeaturing a baritone sax and<br />\nflugelhorn melody by Gary<br />\nSmulyan and Jim Powell,<br />\nbacked first with kicks from the<br />\nband and then by an active reorchestration of the melody. Next<br />\ncomes a monster saxophone solo<br />\nwhose intricacies would make<br />\nKenny G roll up and die. Follow<br />\nthat with solos by Smulyan on<br />\nbani sax, John Mosca on trombone, and Dennis Erwin on bass.<br />\nAdd more tight ensemble work<br />\nand then take the bari/flugel<br />\nmelody out to the end. \"Three in<br />\nOne\" demonstrates exactly whi<br />\nsixteen people on a stage can<br />\noverwhelm an audience.<br />\nThe closer, \"Little Pixie,\" is<br />\nbased on Gershwin's \"I Got<br />\nRhythm,\" and shows the effect<br />\nof taking Gershwiti's title just a<br />\ntad too seriously. The piece is one<br />\nof the most difficult in the big<br />\nband literature, due to its complex<br />\nrhythmic and harmonic interactions between the sections. The<br />\nmiddle serves as a jam session for<br />\nthe saxophone section, with<br />\nalmost everyone getting a chance<br />\nto play, followed by a delightful<br />\nhigh-hat solo by Mel, still one of<br />\nthe most artful drummers playing<br />\ntoday. His solo leads into an<br />\nensemble version of the orginal<br />\nsax melody, led on top by lead<br />\ntrumpeter Earl Gardner. Add a<br />\nfew brass pyramids, a sax hit, and<br />\na trombone crescendo as the tune<br /><br />\nLEAVETH<br /><br />\nto the numbing routine of wallowing in<br />\nbad records, attending Barnstormers<br />\nshows, and accepting any assignment that<br />\nno other writer would willingly complete.<br />\nPaul Kramer assumed one particularly difficult article that no one else would have<br />\nhandled properly, and came through with<br />\nrock-solid prose and ideas.<br />\nJoseph icon.

They were<br />\nreceptive and patient more often than they<br />\nshould have been, and laughed only rarely at my requests. I appreciate all of their<br /><br />\nefforts.<br />\nFor raw dedication and critical insight,<br />\nhowever, nobody at the News-Letter<br />\nwould dispute the contribution of<br />\nChristopher Bonanos. He did sizable<br />\nchunks of everything mentioned above<br />\n(and far more) with finesse and efficiency. He wrote articles on demand in<br />\nridiculously short periods of rime, though<br />\nthe prose never showed it, and his critical<br />\neye for layout (coupled with that of Scott<br />\nNeedle) helped avoid more than one<br />\ndisaster on the Arts pages this year.

Carter and<br />\nguitarist Vince Emmett wrote or<br />\nco-wrote all of the nine songs on<br />\nthe album, and their efforts are<br />\nusually creditable, despite the occasional lapse into :Well it seems<br />\nlike one long endless night/But I<br />\nthink this time I'm finally gonna<br />\nget it right\" formula love songs.<br />\nDrummer Tim Chewnittg<br />\nshould be singled out for praise,<br />\nthough. Lately, even the best<br />\nstudio drummers tend to sound<br />\nlike black boxes from Yamaha<br />\ndealers, cranking out technically<br />\nperfect if uninspired fills. Chew ning lets himself go, sneaking in<br />\nbreaks over and through the vocal<br />\nline along with the usual fills between verses.<br />\nGuitar work from Emmett and<br />\nCarter is likewise well-executed,<br />\nand goes to show that it doesn't<br />\nnecessarily take a Hendrix or a<br />\nClapton to keep a good guitar line<br />\nmoving.<br />\nThe talented musieal performances, however, are somewhat<br />\nsmothered under David Tickle's<br />\nproduction. There's a certain lush<br />\nquality that doesn't match<br />\nCarter's voice at all and takes the<br />\nsharpness off the other performances as well.

Another hangs<br />\nin the conference room, where<br />\nthe medical examiners meet each<br />\nmorning to discuss death in<br />\nMaryland.<br />\nEach year in Maryland, 40,000<br />\npeople die. Roughly a quarter of<br />\nthe deaths are sudden and unexpected: homicides, suicides,<br />\nmotor vehicle accidents,<br />\nsuspicious deaths, and deaths of<br />\npeople not under the care of a<br />\nphysician. All sudden and unex-<br /><br />\nModel<br /><br />\nFnshot<br /><br />\npected deaths must be reported to<br />\nthe Maryland Office of the Chief<br />\nMedical Examiner.<br />\nThe deputy Medical Examiner<br />\nfor the county checks out each<br />\nreported death. If he is satisfied<br />\nthat the cause of death listed on<br />\nthe death certificate is correct, he<br />\nallows the attending physician to<br />\nsign it. Otherwise, he begins an<br />\ninvestigation. He examines the<br />\nbody for external evidence, tries<br />\nto find out what the subject was<br />\ndoing immediately before his<br />\ndeath, and whether drugs or<br />\nalcohol might have been<br />\ninvolved.<br />\nIf he still cannot determine a<br />\ncause of death, he arranges for<br />\nthe body to be sent to the central<br />\noffice in Baltimore for an autopsy. The staff here conduct 3400<br />\nautopsies every year. To begin an<br /><br />\nautoposy, males are cut open with<br />\na Y-shaped incision, from each<br />\nshoulder down through the abdomen. Females receive a<br />\nmodified incision around the<br />\nsides of the breasts. All major<br />\norgans are removed and examined carefully for gross physical<br />\nsigns of disease. Small sections<br />\nof each organ are sliced off to be<br />\nanalyzed, and the remainder is<br />\nreturned to the corpse. Complex<br />\nhomicide cases can take as long<br />\nas five hours to autopsy.<br />\nMuch may be learned from the<br />\ntissue samples. The histology<br />\nlaboratory prepares slides for the<br />\nmedical examiner. Specific findings can indicate particular illnesses, for example, sections of<br />\nheart muscle show damaged cells<br />\nwhen there has been a heart attack. Blood vessel diameter will<br /><br />\nthen be checked for evidence of<br />\narteriosclerosis, a thickening of<br />\nthe walls that can cause a heart<br />\nattack. Arteriosclerosis in young<br />\nbodies can indicate cocaine use.<br />\nSome illnesses cannot be confirmed until after death.<br />\nAlzheimer's disease cannot be<br />\ndefinitively diagnosed without an<br />\nautopsy, when sections of the<br />\ncerebral cortex are stained and<br />\nexamined for the characteristic<br />\nprotein plaques of the disease.<br />\nBlood and other body fluids are<br />\nsampled as well. The medical examiner orders the tests he wants<br />\nperformed by the toxicology<br />\nlaboratory. All samples are tested<br />\nfor blood alcohol content. If the<br />\nmedical examiner suspects drug<br />\nuse, he can order a full or partial<br />\ntoxicology screening.<br />\nSamples are separated into<br />\ncomponents by chromatography,<br />\nthen analyzed by the mass spectrometer, which is connected to<br />\na computer. The program compares the spectrum of the<br />\nunknown with a library of known<br />\ndrugs and toxins.<br />\nThe medical examiners have<br />\nthe legal right to autopsy a body<br />\nto find the cause of death. At<br />\ntimes it has a personal importance<br />\nas well: an autopsy can often help<br />\nfamily members cope with their<br />\ngrief and guilt by proving that the<br />\nvictim could not have been saved.<br />\nSocial programs need cause-ofdeath statistics in order to target<br />\ntheir efforts towards those most<br />\nat risk. Homicide cases often require the testimony of medical examiners, who explain the cause<br />\nof death to the judge and jury.<br />\nMedical examiners are physicians who have done a residency<br />\nin pathology and have received<br />\nfellowship training in forensic<br />\npathology.<br /><br />\nSharyn Horowitz<br /><br />\nSharyn Horowitz<br /><br />\nMedical Examiners' memorabilia<br /><br />\nBill Henry, M.E.<br />\nReporters<br />\nand<br />\nphotographers are not allowed<br />\nto watch autopsies, out of<br />\nrespect for the privacy of the<br />\nsubject's family.
