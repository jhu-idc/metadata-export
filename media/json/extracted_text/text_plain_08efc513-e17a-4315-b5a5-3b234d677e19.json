Each time<br />\ninternational attention strays<br />\nfrom Big Daddy, he sets out to<br />\nwork at reminding the world just<br />\nhow important he is. Thing is,<br />\nwhile most other statesmen<br />\naspire to international acclaim,<br />\nAmin seems to succeed only in<br />\ngaining himself the name of a<br />\nVillain. The fact is that Idi Amin<br />\nbehaves with remarkable<br />\nconfidence for a man who finds<br />\nhimself in such an unstable<br />\nposition as he does, both<br />\ndomestically and internationally.<br />\nAt home, Marshal Amin's<br />\nclaim to power rests on his<br />\nmilitary coup of 1971, in which he<br />\noverthrew his former benefactor,<br />\nMr. Obote, and proceeded to<br />\ndeclare himself President for life.<br />\n(lie prefers subordinates to<br />\naddress him as 'Your Excellency)<br />\nAmin does not tolerate<br />\noPposition to his tight-fisted<br />\nregime;he is suspected of having<br />\nexterminated perhaps thousands<br />\nof political opponents whom he<br />\nhas accused of plotting to<br />\noverthrow him in the past six<br />\nYears. Undoubtedly, Mr. Amin is<br />\nnot wellliked by some in Uganda;<br />\nto date there have been eight<br />\nattempts on his life. Most<br />\n<br />\nrecently, he has been implicated<br />\nin the deatths of Anglican<br />\nArchbishop Janini Luwum and<br />\nhis companion, who died<br />\nmysteriously while under arrest<br />\nin Uganda.<br />\nBut if Idi Amin has a cache of<br />\nenemies in his own country, his<br />\nactions on the world stage have<br />\nnot gained him an image of<br />\nrespect. Marshal Amin has<br />\nsucceeded in alienating almost all<br />\nof his African neighbors,<br />\nincluding Tanzania, Zaire, Kenya,<br />\nand Ethiopia, by accusing them<br />\nof organizing or harboring forces<br />\nintened to invade Uganda.<br />\nFurthermore, he has created<br />\ninternational incidents by<br />\nsentencing a British subject to<br />\ndeath for writing in an<br />\nunpublished manuscript calling<br />\nAmin a 'village tyrant,' by<br />\npermitting Palestinian guerillas to<br />\nhijack Jewish passengers and hold<br />\nthem captive at Entebbe last<br />\nsummer, and last Friday, by<br />\nrefusing to permit American<br />\ncitizens to leave Uganada before<br />\nmeeting with him.<br />\nAll of these actions are those<br />\nof a man surprisingly anxious to<br />\ngain international recognition of<br />\nhis power. In this endeavor he<br />\naas failed miserably. Instead, he<br />\nhas succeeded only in drawing<br />\n<br />\nattention to himself as a rash and<br />\ndangerous dictator, a madman set<br />\non demonstrating his own<br />\nsuperiority. He has declared, 'All<br />\nthose doctors of philosophy,<br />\nthey are not better than me.<br />\nThey cannot do what I do. I am<br />\nvery tough, yes.\"<br />\nYes, Idi Amin is tough and the<br />\ntime has come for President<br />\nCarter to.get tough with him on<br />\nthe release of the Americans held<br />\ncaptive in Uganda. Most of these<br />\nAmericans are missionaries or<br />\ntechnicians working on<br />\ndevelopment and education<br />\nprojects. Carter seems to<br />\nappreciate the potential volatility<br />\nof Amin's actions and has<br />\nordered American warships into<br />\nEast African waters in the event<br />\nthat that they will be needed. but<br />\nAmin's response to to Carter's<br />\nmanuever looks suspiciously like<br />\nthe Marshall wants to re-enact<br />\nthe Entebbe incident of last July,<br />\nonly this time around, Amin<br />\nintends to win. A broadcast on<br />\nthe Uganda radio' yesterday<br />\nstated: \"In the event of an attack<br />\non Uganda, the invaders will bc<br />\ndestroyed by the Uganda armec<br />\nforces before they reach<br />\nU gan da.\"<br />\nThis statement can<br />\nonly be interpreted as a warning<br />\n<br />\nto the U.S. that Amin has full<br />\nauthority in his country, even<br />\nover the U.S. citizens there, and<br />\nthat whatever he attempts to do<br />\nat the meeting on Wednesday is<br />\nto be heeded and obeyed.<br />\nUnquestionably, Carter has the<br />\nresponsibility to protect these<br />\nAmericans and his quick<br />\njudgement may be all that<br />\n<br />\ndecides whether this incident is a<br />\nrerun of the Mayaguez rescue. or<br />\nmushrooms into an international<br />\ndisaster. Hopefully Carter has<br />\nsurmised from Amin's past<br />\nrecord that this man is not to be<br />\nreasoned with, he respects and<br />\nunderstands only the language of<br />\npower and we must respond in<br />\nkind.<br />\n<br />\nStudents To Bologna ........

Just as<br />\nyoung men's fancies turn to thoughts of love in spring, so<br />\ndo the ambitions of these campus miniature Machiavellis<br />\nturn to dreams of political power and simply \"doing good\"<br />\nfor the community. In which order these \"dreams\" occur<br />\ndoesn't make a difference: in a relatively small closed<br />\ncommunity like Hopkins, ideology and methodology<br />\nbecome part of worthless rhetoric useful only for<br />\nnarcississtic purposes or new material for Professor Irwin<br />\nCorey. Unlike a gift, it's not the thought that counts, but<br />\nthe reality.<br />\nEver since Andy Savitz left two years ago, student<br />\nleadership at Hopkins has been remarkably void of the<br />\ndynamism one .expects of youthful politcos whose hot<br />\nblood steams with the anger of being repressed by an<br />\nadministration that cares little about the needs of the<br />\nstudents. As one might have observed, recent student<br />\ngovernments have possessed a quality 9f blandness<br />\nreminiscent of a Don Knotts movie. Last week's SC<br />\n\"picket\" seemed to be little more than a belated Halloween<br />\nmasquerade party. It was both ludicrous and pitiful to<br />\nwatch the members of the student Establishment sauntering<br />\nwith their placards against the administation Establishment.<br />\nListening to the council-provided oratory was as inspiring as<br />\nlistening to afterdinner speeches at the Seacaucus (NJ)<br />\nKiwania Club.<br />\nWhat was particularly impressive about the calendar<br />\nprotest was the cohesion of the freshman class into a viable<br />\npolitical entity. The organizers of the \"march\" across<br />\ncampus should be congratulated for successfully<br />\nundertaking the task of arousing a class known more for its<br />\nfrisbee throwing than its political action. It's a healthy sign<br />\nthat some one (or group) had the courage and ingenuity to<br />\ncreate the only excitement the protest could offer. Perhaps<br />\nin the upcoming SC elections some \"unknown\" will rise<br />\nfrom the freshman class and show the lackluster<br />\nupperclassmen how a student government should be run.<br />\nMaybe the upperclassmen will realize their failure to<br />\nformulate effective leadership.

WEISS<br />\nAbout a year ago I wrote ar<br />\narticle describing shortcomings 1<br />\nperceived in Hopkins that<br />\ncontributed to my withdrawal<br />\nfrom the University. In the<br />\narticle, entitled \"And Another<br />\nOne Bites the Dust...,\"<br />\ncontended that Hopkins created<br />\nan environment which caused an<br />\nundue amount of strain on an<br />\nUndecided Student, and I still<br />\nfeel this is the case. It is now<br />\nclear that a valid response to this<br />\nkind of pressure is to take a<br />\nbreak. It is clear because I did it,<br />\nand now I'm back.<br />\nA year ago I pointed out that<br />\nthe type of student entering<br />\nHopkins can carry the seeds of<br />\nhis or her own problem On. the<br />\naver.age, admittedly with<br />\nexceptions, the type meeting<br />\nHopkins' criteria is extremely<br />\ngoal-oriented and competitive.<br />\nThe most important things in<br />\nthat particular life are likely to<br />\nhave been academics. A student<br />\nwho fails to meet the self and<br />\npeer induced standards of<br />\nacademic success is more likely<br />\nto buckle under the pressure,<br />\nthan an individual who uses a<br />\nbroader standard to measure his<br />\nself worth.<br />\nMost Hopkins freshmen<br />\nmatriculate virtually certain of<br />\nthe path they will follow for the<br />\nnext several years. There is an<br />\nelitist sentiment, an awareness of<br />\nthe fact that they are somewhere<br />\nnear the top, academically<br />\nspeaking. This leads, in many<br />\ncases, to a use of academic<br />\nstandards to measure the worth<br />\nof themselves and others. In<br />\nother words, if I get good grades,<br />\nI am a good and successful<br />\nperson, following a good and<br />\nsuccessful path. If I do not get<br />\ngood grades, I am a failure. When<br />\nthe initial uncertainty begins to<br />\ncreep in about academics and<br />\ncareers, the feeling of immiment<br />\nfailure can lead to psychological<br />\nbreakdown. Most of us have<br />\nwitnessed this in some form, even<br />\nif we did not experience it. That<br />\nit occurs is not surprising: the<br />\nentire moral and ethical<br />\nunderpinnings of a lifetime are<br />\nbeing called into question. There<br />\nis, if you will, a loss of<br />\ninnocence.<br />\nIf the internal confusion is not<br />\nsufficient to unbalance one, the<br />\nenvironment of Hopkins can<br />\nexacerbate the problem.<br />\nIntrospection is like any other<br />\nform of meditation; it is difficult,<br />\nparticularly for a novice, to do<br />\nunder pressure. Consider the<br />\nplight of the Hopkins student<br />\nChemistry, Dr. Cowan's section,<br />\nrespectively), which seems<br />\nnormal enough to the initiated<br />\namong us, but somehow this<br />\nannoyed me.

However, the<br />\nsame hubris that creates the<br />\nproblem makes it that much<br />\nmore difficult to seek help. After<br />\nall, if 'everyone else' is making it<br />\non their own, how am Ito admit<br />\nmy failure?<br />\nRegardless, I can say that<br />\nleaving Hopkins was the best, and<br />\nmaybe only real existential<br />\ndecision that I have ever made.<br />\nWith some specific caveats, I can<br />\n<br />\nrecommend a break to anyone<br />\nhere who is sufficiently confused<br />\nabout the future. If, by the<br />\nmiddle of junior year, a student<br />\nat Hopkins still has no firm<br />\nacademic goals but has explored<br />\nthe resources of the University<br />\nthoroughly, and has sufficient<br />\nmoral and financial support from<br />\nwhomever will be paying the<br />\nbills, it may well be time for a<br />\nbreak.<br />\nLeaving with no purpose is a<br />\nmistake. What any Hopkins<br />\nstudent is doing by leaving is<br />\nbuying time. The most vile<br />\ncanard every perpetrated is \"If<br />\nyou leave, you won't come<br />\nback.\" Of course you will! Let's<br />\nface it, not too many JHU<br />\nstudents would be happy<br />\nspending their lives in a job not<br />\nrequiring a diploma. Most jobs<br />\nfalling into that category are<br />\npretty dull. Which is exactly the<br />\npoint. By leaving, and getting one<br />\nof these jobs, it is possible to find<br />\nthe time and perspective that<br />\n<br />\ndoesn't exist in the rifle-shot<br />\nw or-Id of high-powered<br />\nacademics. I took jobs as a short<br />\norder cook, a solicitor of funds<br />\nfor a public service group, and an<br />\nassistant manager of a women's<br />\nclothing store. These jobs were<br />\neducational, believe me, but they<br />\nalso gave me the time I needed to<br />\ncarefully consider my future.<br />\nThe most important<br />\nrealization I came to was that<br />\nleaving, while in one sense an<br />\nadmission of failure, can be a<br />\ndemonstration of maturity.<br />\nAssuming that the most<br />\nimportant thing to have, after the<br />\nphysical essentials, is some sense<br />\nof internal stability, acting in a<br />\nway that contributes to its<br />\ndevelopment is, by definition,<br />\nabsolutely mature. The<br />\nrealization that there are any<br />\nnumber of equally valid paths to<br />\nHappiness, and that the loss of<br />\none path does not imply the loss<br />\nof happiness, is not a trivial<br />\naccomplishment. By leaving,<br />\nadmitting failure, and still<br />\nsurviving, I freed myself of the<br />\nfear of failure. Realizing that one<br />\nis free to fail without destroying<br />\none's internal stability makes it<br />\npossible to fully and freely<br />\npursue success.<br />\nAfter figuring out a direction,<br />\nthe problem then reduces to<br />\ndetermining the best means to<br />\nachieve the end. Hopkins is like a<br />\nmarvelously well equipped tool<br />\nbox. Given a definite project, and<br />\nthe ability to use the tools, the<br />\npossibilities are limitless. All<br />\nthings being equal, a student is<br />\nfreer to excell here than \u2022<br />\nanywhere else that I know. I feel<br />\nthat the tools that I need are<br />\nhere, and so I returned.<br />\nArchimedes once said that if<br />\nhe had a lever long enough and a<br />\nplace to stand he could move the<br />\nEarth.

After<br />\nso many years of not making any<br />\nreal decisions, and after so many<br />\nyears of classes, it may just be<br />\ntime for a decision. If the need is<br />\nreally there and you have the<br />\nability, leaving for a time could<br />\nbe a good move.\u2022<br />\nOn a personal level, in a year<br />\nin which it is fashionable to be<br />\nborn again, it seems only fitting<br />\nthat I amback.

On<br />\nWednesday, Mr. Warren read his<br />\nPoetry to a packed and<br />\nenthusiastic audience in the<br />\nGarret Room of the Eisenhower<br />\nLibrary.<br />\nWarren actively continues his<br />\ncontributions to the American<br />\nliterary scene. Beginning from<br />\nwell-publicied Southern roots,<br />\nWarren attended Vanderbilt<br />\nUniversity where friendship was<br />\ninitiated with poets John Crowe<br />\nRansom and Allen Tate. There,<br />\nWarren and other \"young men<br />\ninterested in philosophy and<br />\nPoetry\" organized the fugitive<br />\nPoetry movement, the ruddy<br />\nfaced poet said. The futurists<br />\nWrote with the hope that an<br />\nagrarian culture in the South<br />\ncould be preserved against the<br />\nencroachments 'of growing<br />\nindustrial and mercantile values.<br />\nAlthough his poetry has<br />\nMoved away from the<br />\nC onservatism espoused in it<br />\n<br />\nduring the 1930's, some of these<br />\nearly values still persist. \"The<br />\nquestion-is how we can have the<br />\nbenefits of an industrialized,<br />\nelectronic society and still<br />\nmaintain human values, where<br />\nthe individual - doesn't just<br />\nbecome a cog.\" The \"New<br />\nSouth\" is vastly different from.<br />\nthe \"civic serise\" that one found<br />\nin the 1920's and 1930's, he said.<br />\n\"The city flow and TV culture<br />\nhave taken over.

The whole<br />\ngroup was soaked in poetry.\"<br />\nSuch meetings of literary<br />\nenthusiasm are rare today, he<br />\nsaid. The influences of the<br />\nmetaphysical qualities in 16th<br />\nand 17th century English poetry<br />\nare engendered in the narrative<br />\n<br />\nballads, often dealing with<br />\nSouthern cultural experience,<br />\nthat have become his trademark.<br />\nWarren ceased to teach poetry<br />\nwriting in the 1940's when he<br />\ndecided that theoretical<br />\ndiscussion of poetry stifled his<br />\n;reativity. \"You as the poet are<br />\nin the baby's arms and have to<br />\nforget all that theory,\" he said of<br />\na necessary mood of innocence.<br />\nIn order to establish such a<br />\nmental state, Warren said he<br />\nskies, jogs, mountain climbs, and<br />\nswims, \"to blank the mind, but<br />\nnot wear you out. You don't<br />\nwrite poems sitting at a<br />\ntypewriter,\" he said.<br />\nSeemingly filled with an<br />\nunending repertoire of stories<br />\nwhich he can convert into<br />\nnarrative poetry or fiction, he<br />\nreminds the reader that \"the<br />\n'speaker' of the poem is never to<br />\nbe literally identified with the<br />\nactual poet with pants and vest -the speaker is a persona -- a guide<br />\n-- and is as masked as was ever a<br />\nGreek who stood on the<br />\nfoot-pounded earth of the<br />\ndancing place to utter through an<br />\ninhuman mask the passion and<br />\nmetaphysics- combined.\" Asked<br />\n<br />\nfor his approximation for the<br />\nrelative merits in the 19th and<br />\n20th century poetic movements<br />\nof symbolism, imagism, and<br />\nconfessionalism, Warren said<br />\n\"imagism had no future,\"<br />\nalthough \"(Ezra) Pound made it<br />\na key and some of H.D.'s (Hilda<br />\nDoolittle's) short poems are<br />\ngems.\" He said imagism was a<br />\n\"healthy reaction\" against the<br />\ndidactic tendencies of the<br />\nprevious generation. With<br />\nsymbolism, however, Warren is<br />\nmuch closer, he said. \"Baudelaire<br />\nhas been a great influence on my<br />\npoetry and life.\" He likes the<br />\nearlier work of Robert Lowell,<br />\nchief purveyor of<br />\nconfessionalism, but \"his last two<br />\nor three books haven't been too<br />\ngood.\"<br />\n\"All composition is verbalized<br />\nin the head.

Students often<br />\nComplain about the lack of<br />\n'things to do,\" and being<br />\nunusually optimistic, I thought<br />\nthe New Club Anatomy might be<br />\n<br />\na new, outlet for legendary<br />\nstudent tensions. Such, however,<br />\nwas not the case.<br />\nThe New Club Anatomy is<br />\nlocated at 1819 N. Charles St.,<br />\nabout a half block south of<br />\nNorth Ave., and only two<br />\n-minutes away by bus.<br />\nUnfortunately, this is an area<br />\n<br />\nMouthTube<br />\nwill let you sing your axe off.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 -clectro-barmonix<br />\n<br />\n27West23rdStreet<br />\n\u2022 New`rfork,NY10010<br />\n<br />\nfrequented by few if any<br />\nstudents, regardless of their<br />\nhunger for fun and games. It's<br />\nopen from 9pm to 2 am<br />\nThursdays through Sundays,<br />\nalthough groups sometimes rent<br />\nit for private parties on Sundays.<br />\nThere's a liquor store doing a<br />\nrousing business on one side of<br />\nthe club and an alley on the<br />\nother. A regular group plays<br />\nFridays through Sundays and<br />\nnew bands play on Thursdays.<br />\nThere is no cover charge and<br />\ndrinks are of moderate price for<br />\nthe area.<br />\nThe New Club Anatomy is<br />\ntiny, and the front is pretty<br />\ntacky. Gold letters cut from<br />\ncardboard were splattered upon<br />\nthe glass window. A sign<br />\nadvertising packaged goods was<br />\nin one corner of the window,<br />\nalthough I never saw any inside.<br />\nThe most interesting thing about<br />\nthe place was also on the window<br />\n- two gold cardboard go-go girls.<br />\nThe go-go dancers were the only<br />\nconnection I could make to the<br />\nclub's name. This makes the New<br />\nClub Anatomy the closest place<br />\nto Hopkins that has \"dancers,\"<br />\n\u2022and if that's what you're used to,<br />\nthe place is for you. The club is<br />\nsmall, though, so chances are you<br />\nmight find them dancing on your<br />\ntable.<br />\nThe music sounded pretty<br />\ndecent from outside, so I walked<br />\nin and found myself eye to eye<br />\n<br />\nwith the bouncer's belt buckle.<br />\nAt least seven feet tall, the man _<br />\noccupied half the entire club. To<br />\nthe left of him was your regular<br />\nthree-sided bar, with a mirror<br />\nbehind it. Approximately fifty<br />\npeople could be seated at the<br />\nsmall wooden tables graced with<br />\nItalian- style red and white<br />\ncheckered tablecloths. The club<br />\ncould probably hold seventy<br />\npeople if the bouncer stood<br />\noutside. The decor of the club is<br />\ndisco: red lights and rotating ball,<br />\nwith the added feature of several<br />\nAfrican-style pices of sculpture<br />\nscattered around.<br />\nThe main attraction, a jazz<br />\nband, was at the back of the club<br />\non a ,raised stage. The group<br />\nplaying that night was a<br />\nthree-piece ensemble, consisting<br />\nof a .rap set, bass, and<br />\nkeyboards. I wasn't able to learn<br />\nthe name of the group, but their<br />\nmusic wasn't too bad, being that<br />\nnon-descript type ofjazz that I'm<br />\nsure almost everyone has heard at<br />\none time or another. The music<br />\nwas easy-listening, without the<br />\nfrills of progressive, Dixieland, or<br />\nswing. The crowd seemed to<br />\nenjoy the performance, and the<br />\nmood was low-key. The New<br />\nClub Anatomy is quite possibly<br />\nan asset to the North Avenue<br />\narea, but I seriously doubt any<br />\nstudents would be tempted to<br />\nspend an evening there.<br />\nThe New Club Anatcmy<br />\n<br />\nsymbolizes a problem that many<br />\njazz lovers at Hopkins face. There<br />\nare essentially two options open<br />\nto these people. They can<br />\nsomehow find transportation to a<br />\njazz spot in outer Baltimore or<br />\nDC and pay through the teeth to<br />\nhear any type of jazz music. The<br />\nother alternative is to go to a<br />\ncheap joint in downtown<br />\nBaltimore, worry about the<br />\nbuses, and glance paranoically<br />\nover your shoulder all night. The<br />\nRa thskellar occasionally offers<br />\njazz, from Peabody and as far<br />\naway as New York, but these<br />\n\"treats\" are all too infrequent.<br />\nThe perfect answer would be<br />\nan inexpensive club close to the<br />\nUniversity that could<br />\naccomodate a medium to large<br />\nnumber of patrons. Quite a few<br />\ngood jazz groups exist in<br />\nBaltimore, but a majority either<br />\nrefuse to play at certain clubs<br />\nbecause -of a possible compromise<br />\nto their musical talent, or clubs<br />\nreject them because the type of<br />\njazz they perform is too avant<br />\ngarde for business.

Each time<br />\ninternational attention strays<br />\nfrom Big Daddy, he sets out to<br />\nwork at reminding the world just<br />\nhow important he is. Thing is,<br />\nwhile most other statesmen<br />\naspire to international acclaim,<br />\nAmin seems to succeed only in<br />\ngaining himself the name of a<br />\nVillain. The fact is that Idi Amin<br />\nbehaves with remarkable<br />\nconfidence for a man who finds<br />\nhimself in such an unstable<br />\nposition as he does, both<br />\ndomestically and internationally.<br />\nAt home, Marshal Amin's<br />\nclaim to power rests on his<br />\nmilitary coup of 1971, in which he<br />\noverthrew his former benefactor,<br />\nMr. Obote, and proceeded to<br />\ndeclare himself President for life.<br />\n(lie prefers subordinates to<br />\naddress him as 'Your Excellency)<br />\nAmin does not tolerate<br />\noPposition to his tight-fisted<br />\nregime;he is suspected of having<br />\nexterminated perhaps thousands<br />\nof political opponents whom he<br />\nhas accused of plotting to<br />\noverthrow him in the past six<br />\nYears. Undoubtedly, Mr. Amin is<br />\nnot wellliked by some in Uganda;<br />\nto date there have been eight<br />\nattempts on his life. Most<br /><br />\nrecently, he has been implicated<br />\nin the deatths of Anglican<br />\nArchbishop Janini Luwum and<br />\nhis companion, who died<br />\nmysteriously while under arrest<br />\nin Uganda.<br />\nBut if Idi Amin has a cache of<br />\nenemies in his own country, his<br />\nactions on the world stage have<br />\nnot gained him an image of<br />\nrespect. Marshal Amin has<br />\nsucceeded in alienating almost all<br />\nof his African neighbors,<br />\nincluding Tanzania, Zaire, Kenya,<br />\nand Ethiopia, by accusing them<br />\nof organizing or harboring forces<br />\nintened to invade Uganda.<br />\nFurthermore, he has created<br />\ninternational incidents by<br />\nsentencing a British subject to<br />\ndeath for writing in an<br />\nunpublished manuscript calling<br />\nAmin a 'village tyrant,' by<br />\npermitting Palestinian guerillas to<br />\nhijack Jewish passengers and hold<br />\nthem captive at Entebbe last<br />\nsummer, and last Friday, by<br />\nrefusing to permit American<br />\ncitizens to leave Uganada before<br />\nmeeting with him.<br />\nAll of these actions are those<br />\nof a man surprisingly anxious to<br />\ngain international recognition of<br />\nhis power. In this endeavor he<br />\naas failed miserably. Instead, he<br />\nhas succeeded only in drawing<br /><br />\nattention to himself as a rash and<br />\ndangerous dictator, a madman set<br />\non demonstrating his own<br />\nsuperiority. He has declared, 'All<br />\nthose doctors of philosophy,<br />\nthey are not better than me.<br />\nThey cannot do what I do. I am<br />\nvery tough, yes.\"<br />\nYes, Idi Amin is tough and the<br />\ntime has come for President<br />\nCarter to.get tough with him on<br />\nthe release of the Americans held<br />\ncaptive in Uganda. Most of these<br />\nAmericans are missionaries or<br />\ntechnicians working on<br />\ndevelopment and education<br />\nprojects. Carter seems to<br />\nappreciate the potential volatility<br />\nof Amin's actions and has<br />\nordered American warships into<br />\nEast African waters in the event<br />\nthat that they will be needed. but<br />\nAmin's response to to Carter's<br />\nmanuever looks suspiciously like<br />\nthe Marshall wants to re-enact<br />\nthe Entebbe incident of last July,<br />\nonly this time around, Amin<br />\nintends to win. A broadcast on<br />\nthe Uganda radio' yesterday<br />\nstated: \"In the event of an attack<br />\non Uganda, the invaders will bc<br />\ndestroyed by the Uganda armec<br />\nforces before they reach<br />\nU gan da.\"<br />\nThis statement can<br />\nonly be interpreted as a warning<br /><br />\nto the U.S. that Amin has full<br />\nauthority in his country, even<br />\nover the U.S. citizens there, and<br />\nthat whatever he attempts to do<br />\nat the meeting on Wednesday is<br />\nto be heeded and obeyed.<br />\nUnquestionably, Carter has the<br />\nresponsibility to protect these<br />\nAmericans and his quick<br />\njudgement may be all that<br /><br />\ndecides whether this incident is a<br />\nrerun of the Mayaguez rescue. or<br />\nmushrooms into an international<br />\ndisaster. Hopefully Carter has<br />\nsurmised from Amin's past<br />\nrecord that this man is not to be<br />\nreasoned with, he respects and<br />\nunderstands only the language of<br />\npower and we must respond in<br />\nkind.<br /><br />\nStudents To Bologna ........

Business hours<br />\nare Monday and Thursday afternoons.<br /><br />\na time...<br />\nWith every turn towards spring the keen excitement<br />\nsurrounding the derring-do political<br />\nmaneuvering of<br />\nStudent Council Elections (Homewood's version of the<br />\ntraditional smalltown \"Spring Follies\") often mounts to a<br />\nshattering, breathless' muldaneness, a ripple in the limpid<br />\npool of apathy in which we all are slowly sinking. Just as<br />\nyoung men's fancies turn to thoughts of love in spring, so<br />\ndo the ambitions of these campus miniature Machiavellis<br />\nturn to dreams of political power and simply \"doing good\"<br />\nfor the community. In which order these \"dreams\" occur<br />\ndoesn't make a difference: in a relatively small closed<br />\ncommunity like Hopkins, ideology and methodology<br />\nbecome part of worthless rhetoric useful only for<br />\nnarcississtic purposes or new material for Professor Irwin<br />\nCorey. Unlike a gift, it's not the thought that counts, but<br />\nthe reality.<br />\nEver since Andy Savitz left two years ago, student<br />\nleadership at Hopkins has been remarkably void of the<br />\ndynamism one .expects of youthful politcos whose hot<br />\nblood steams with the anger of being repressed by an<br />\nadministration that cares little about the needs of the<br />\nstudents. As one might have observed, recent student<br />\ngovernments have possessed a quality 9f blandness<br />\nreminiscent of a Don Knotts movie. Last week's SC<br />\n\"picket\" seemed to be little more than a belated Halloween<br />\nmasquerade party. It was both ludicrous and pitiful to<br />\nwatch the members of the student Establishment sauntering<br />\nwith their placards against the administation Establishment.<br />\nListening to the council-provided oratory was as inspiring as<br />\nlistening to afterdinner speeches at the Seacaucus (NJ)<br />\nKiwania Club.<br />\nWhat was particularly impressive about the calendar<br />\nprotest was the cohesion of the freshman class into a viable<br />\npolitical entity. The organizers of the \"march\" across<br />\ncampus should be congratulated for successfully<br />\nundertaking the task of arousing a class known more for its<br />\nfrisbee throwing than its political action. It's a healthy sign<br />\nthat some one (or group) had the courage and ingenuity to<br />\ncreate the only excitement the protest could offer. Perhaps<br />\nin the upcoming SC elections some \"unknown\" will rise<br />\nfrom the freshman class and show the lackluster<br />\nupperclassmen how a student government should be run.<br />\nMaybe the upperclassmen will realize their failure to<br />\nformulate effective leadership.

WEISS<br />\nAbout a year ago I wrote ar<br />\narticle describing shortcomings 1<br />\nperceived in Hopkins that<br />\ncontributed to my withdrawal<br />\nfrom the University. In the<br />\narticle, entitled \"And Another<br />\nOne Bites the Dust...,\"<br />\ncontended that Hopkins created<br />\nan environment which caused an<br />\nundue amount of strain on an<br />\nUndecided Student, and I still<br />\nfeel this is the case. It is now<br />\nclear that a valid response to this<br />\nkind of pressure is to take a<br />\nbreak. It is clear because I did it,<br />\nand now I'm back.<br />\nA year ago I pointed out that<br />\nthe type of student entering<br />\nHopkins can carry the seeds of<br />\nhis or her own problem On. the<br />\naver.age, admittedly with<br />\nexceptions, the type meeting<br />\nHopkins' criteria is extremely<br />\ngoal-oriented and competitive.<br />\nThe most important things in<br />\nthat particular life are likely to<br />\nhave been academics. A student<br />\nwho fails to meet the self and<br />\npeer induced standards of<br />\nacademic success is more likely<br />\nto buckle under the pressure,<br />\nthan an individual who uses a<br />\nbroader standard to measure his<br />\nself worth.<br />\nMost Hopkins freshmen<br />\nmatriculate virtually certain of<br />\nthe path they will follow for the<br />\nnext several years. There is an<br />\nelitist sentiment, an awareness of<br />\nthe fact that they are somewhere<br />\nnear the top, academically<br />\nspeaking. This leads, in many<br />\ncases, to a use of academic<br />\nstandards to measure the worth<br />\nof themselves and others. In<br />\nother words, if I get good grades,<br />\nI am a good and successful<br />\nperson, following a good and<br />\nsuccessful path. If I do not get<br />\ngood grades, I am a failure. When<br />\nthe initial uncertainty begins to<br />\ncreep in about academics and<br />\ncareers, the feeling of immiment<br />\nfailure can lead to psychological<br />\nbreakdown. Most of us have<br />\nwitnessed this in some form, even<br />\nif we did not experience it. That<br />\nit occurs is not surprising: the<br />\nentire moral and ethical<br />\nunderpinnings of a lifetime are<br />\nbeing called into question. There<br />\nis, if you will, a loss of<br />\ninnocence.<br />\nIf the internal confusion is not<br />\nsufficient to unbalance one, the<br />\nenvironment of Hopkins can<br />\nexacerbate the problem.<br />\nIntrospection is like any other<br />\nform of meditation; it is difficult,<br />\nparticularly for a novice, to do<br />\nunder pressure.

When<br />\neveryone else seems to be calmly<br />\nand assuredly on their way to<br />\nSomewhere, an individual who is<br />\nsuddenly on the way to only<br />\nFind Out can be made to feel<br />\nvery much a failure.<br />\nThere are places to go for help<br />\nwhen this kind of thing happens.<br />\nThe White House, the Deans, and<br />\nfriends can all help. However, the<br />\nsame hubris that creates the<br />\nproblem makes it that much<br />\nmore difficult to seek help. After<br />\nall, if 'everyone else' is making it<br />\non their own, how am Ito admit<br />\nmy failure?<br />\nRegardless, I can say that<br />\nleaving Hopkins was the best, and<br />\nmaybe only real existential<br />\ndecision that I have ever made.<br />\nWith some specific caveats, I can<br /><br />\nrecommend a break to anyone<br />\nhere who is sufficiently confused<br />\nabout the future.

What any Hopkins<br />\nstudent is doing by leaving is<br />\nbuying time. The most vile<br />\ncanard every perpetrated is \"If<br />\nyou leave, you won't come<br />\nback.\" Of course you will! Let's<br />\nface it, not too many JHU<br />\nstudents would be happy<br />\nspending their lives in a job not<br />\nrequiring a diploma. Most jobs<br />\nfalling into that category are<br />\npretty dull. Which is exactly the<br />\npoint. By leaving, and getting one<br />\nof these jobs, it is possible to find<br />\nthe time and perspective that<br /><br />\ndoesn't exist in the rifle-shot<br />\nw or-Id of high-powered<br />\nacademics. I took jobs as a short<br />\norder cook, a solicitor of funds<br />\nfor a public service group, and an<br />\nassistant manager of a women's<br />\nclothing store. These jobs were<br />\neducational, believe me, but they<br />\nalso gave me the time I needed to<br />\ncarefully consider my future.<br />\nThe most important<br />\nrealization I came to was that<br />\nleaving, while in one sense an<br />\nadmission of failure, can be a<br />\ndemonstration of maturity.<br />\nAssuming that the most<br />\nimportant thing to have, after the<br />\nphysical essentials, is some sense<br />\nof internal stability, acting in a<br />\nway that contributes to its<br />\ndevelopment is, by definition,<br />\nabsolutely mature. The<br />\nrealization that there are any<br />\nnumber of equally valid paths to<br />\nHappiness, and that the loss of<br />\none path does not imply the loss<br />\nof happiness, is not a trivial<br />\naccomplishment. By leaving,<br />\nadmitting failure, and still<br />\nsurviving, I freed myself of the<br />\nfear of failure. Realizing that one<br />\nis free to fail without destroying<br />\none's internal stability makes it<br />\npossible to fully and freely<br />\npursue success.<br />\nAfter figuring out a direction,<br />\nthe problem then reduces to<br />\ndetermining the best means to<br />\nachieve the end. Hopkins is like a<br />\nmarvelously well equipped tool<br />\nbox. Given a definite project, and<br />\nthe ability to use the tools, the<br />\npossibilities are limitless. All<br />\nthings being equal, a student is<br />\nfreer to excell here than \u2022<br />\nanywhere else that I know. I feel<br />\nthat the tools that I need are<br />\nhere, and so I returned.<br />\nArchimedes once said that if<br />\nhe had a lever long enough and a<br />\nplace to stand he could move the<br />\nEarth. Moving one's internal<br />\nworld requires an equal amount<br />\nof strength and perspective. After<br />\nso many years of not making any<br />\nreal decisions, and after so many<br />\nyears of classes, it may just be<br />\ntime for a decision. If the need is<br />\nreally there and you have the<br />\nability, leaving for a time could<br />\nbe a good move.\u2022<br />\nOn a personal level, in a year<br />\nin which it is fashionable to be<br />\nborn again, it seems only fitting<br />\nthat I amback. There is no doubt<br />\nthat I needed to leave. There is<br />\nalso no doubt that I am glad to<br />\nreturn. Cynicism and exigencies<br />\naside, if you can handle it, this is<br />\na nretty good place to be.<br />\n\u201e<br />\nFrom now on, this space Will<br />\nbe reserved for submissions by<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins campus.<br /><br />\nrigidly defined scales are in<br />\nexistence) - notice that a failure<br />\nconstitutes anything below 65,<br />\ndangerously close to our own<br />\nclass averages. Bad as this is,<br />\nwhether it be the general low<br />\nintelligence of our class or the<br />\ndifficulty of the tests, the worst<br />\nis yet to come. These normal D<br />\ngrades are considered 'average,'<br />\nfair enough; but considered a B<br />\naverage is outlandish. By any<br />\napproach, C is an \"average\"<br />\ngrade, and B a 'better than<br />\naverage' grade. Why do we<br />\noperate under our present<br />\nillusion? If no better answer can<br />\nbe given than that everyone else<br />\ndoes it, we are in sad shape.<br /><br />\nMutual conspiracy of hordes of<br />\naspiring doctors and avaricious<br />\ncolleges and universities created<br />\nthis demon of mediocrity. I don't<br />\nwish to be at a loss to explain<br />\nthis to any impartial observer,<br />\nbut I'm afraid I cannot<br />\nrationalize this protection of<br />\n'average' ego through a `smear'<br />\ncampaign. The most that can be<br />\naccomplished is to render<br />\nmeaningless the vestige of<br />\nacademia.

On<br />\nWednesday, Mr. Warren read his<br />\nPoetry to a packed and<br />\nenthusiastic audience in the<br />\nGarret Room of the Eisenhower<br />\nLibrary.<br />\nWarren actively continues his<br />\ncontributions to the American<br />\nliterary scene. Beginning from<br />\nwell-publicied Southern roots,<br />\nWarren attended Vanderbilt<br />\nUniversity where friendship was<br />\ninitiated with poets John Crowe<br />\nRansom and Allen Tate. There,<br />\nWarren and other \"young men<br />\ninterested in philosophy and<br />\nPoetry\" organized the fugitive<br />\nPoetry movement, the ruddy<br />\nfaced poet said. The futurists<br />\nWrote with the hope that an<br />\nagrarian culture in the South<br />\ncould be preserved against the<br />\nencroachments 'of growing<br />\nindustrial and mercantile values.<br />\nAlthough his poetry has<br />\nMoved away from the<br />\nC onservatism espoused in it<br /><br />\nduring the 1930's, some of these<br />\nearly values still persist. \"The<br />\nquestion-is how we can have the<br />\nbenefits of an industrialized,<br />\nelectronic society and still<br />\nmaintain human values, where<br />\nthe individual - doesn't just<br />\nbecome a cog.\" The \"New<br />\nSouth\" is vastly different from.<br />\nthe \"civic serise\" that one found<br />\nin the 1920's and 1930's, he said.<br />\n\"The city flow and TV culture<br />\nhave taken over. Before you had<br />\nsome sense of hurhan recognition<br />\nand shared-values, a community<br />\nawareness, along with the<br />\n6rgani-zation of goods and<br />\nservices necessary for an Orderly<br />\nsociety_ But technological society<br />\nmight - be all society and no<br />\ncommunity.'In Democracy and<br />\nPoetry (1973) Warren discusses<br />\nthe decline of \"selfhood\" in<br />\nAmerica which he says is<br />\ninconsistent with the values of<br />\ndemocracy spawned during the<br />\nAmerican Revolution.<br />\nThe rapid ascension of Jimmy<br />\nCarter to the presidency, the<br />\npoet said, reflects the<br />\n\"homogeneity of America, rather<br />\nthan a shift of values from North<br />\nto South.\" He laments however<br />\nthat the Southern tradition of<br />\n\"tale telling\" has been<br />\nsupplanted by the lulling effects<br />\nof television.<br />\nPoetry for Warren is a way of<br />\nreinforcing the notion of the self<br />\nand community spirit. As a<br /><br />\n. Poet Warren at Cornmeration<br /><br />\nsection of his poem, Audibon: A<br />\nVision proclaims: \"Tell me a<br />\nstory/In this century, and<br />\nmoment, of mania,/Tell me a<br />\nstory.\" He stressed this very<br />\npoint during his commemoration<br />\naddress. \"If we often feel our<br />\nlives in general to suffer from<br />\nsuch impairment, such disability,<br />\nand such disunity; there is at<br />\nleast one place to which we can<br />\nturn to discover again, however<br />\nmomentarily, what the perfect<br />\noccasion and the perfect response<br />\ncan mean...we need only turn to<br />\na strong piece of literature.\"<br />\nThe 71 year old, Kentucky<br />\nborn poet, recently retired from<br />\nhis professorship at Yale<br />\nUniversity has a particular<br />\naffinity for Elizabethan poetry.<br />\n\"I'm an Elizabethan by trade and<br />\ntaught it for years.\" While a<br />\nstudent at Vanderbilt, \"six or<br />\neight boys used to get together<br />\nand just read poetry. The whole<br />\ngroup was soaked in poetry.\"<br />\nSuch meetings of literary<br />\nenthusiasm are rare today, he<br />\nsaid. The influences of the<br />\nmetaphysical qualities in 16th<br />\nand 17th century English poetry<br />\nare engendered in the narrative<br /><br />\nballads, often dealing with<br />\nSouthern cultural experience,<br />\nthat have become his trademark.<br />\nWarren ceased to teach poetry<br />\nwriting in the 1940's when he<br />\ndecided that theoretical<br />\ndiscussion of poetry stifled his<br />\n;reativity. \"You as the poet are<br />\nin the baby's arms and have to<br />\nforget all that theory,\" he said of<br />\na necessary mood of innocence.<br />\nIn order to establish such a<br />\nmental state, Warren said he<br />\nskies, jogs, mountain climbs, and<br />\nswims, \"to blank the mind, but<br />\nnot wear you out. You don't<br />\nwrite poems sitting at a<br />\ntypewriter,\" he said.<br />\nSeemingly filled with an<br />\nunending repertoire of stories<br />\nwhich he can convert into<br />\nnarrative poetry or fiction, he<br />\nreminds the reader that \"the<br />\n'speaker' of the poem is never to<br />\nbe literally identified with the<br />\nactual poet with pants and vest -the speaker is a persona -- a guide<br />\n-- and is as masked as was ever a<br />\nGreek who stood on the<br />\nfoot-pounded earth of the<br />\ndancing place to utter through an<br />\ninhuman mask the passion and<br />\nmetaphysics- combined.\" Asked<br /><br />\nfor his approximation for the<br />\nrelative merits in the 19th and<br />\n20th century poetic movements<br />\nof symbolism, imagism, and<br />\nconfessionalism, Warren said<br />\n\"imagism had no future,\"<br />\nalthough \"(Ezra) Pound made it<br />\na key and some of H.D.'s (Hilda<br />\nDoolittle's) short poems are<br />\ngems.\" He said imagism was a<br />\n\"healthy reaction\" against the<br />\ndidactic tendencies of the<br />\nprevious generation. With<br />\nsymbolism, however, Warren is<br />\nmuch closer, he said. \"Baudelaire<br />\nhas been a great influence on my<br />\npoetry and life.\" He likes the<br />\nearlier work of Robert Lowell,<br />\nchief purveyor of<br />\nconfessionalism, but \"his last two<br />\nor three books haven't been too<br />\ngood.\"<br />\n\"All composition is verbalized<br />\nin the head. The poet tries to<br />\nindicate a speech, a rhetoric if<br />\nyou will.

Students often<br />\nComplain about the lack of<br />\n'things to do,\" and being<br />\nunusually optimistic, I thought<br />\nthe New Club Anatomy might be<br /><br />\na new, outlet for legendary<br />\nstudent tensions. Such, however,<br />\nwas not the case.<br />\nThe New Club Anatomy is<br />\nlocated at 1819 N. Charles St.,<br />\nabout a half block south of<br />\nNorth Ave., and only two<br />\n-minutes away by bus.<br />\nUnfortunately, this is an area<br /><br />\nMouthTube<br />\nwill let you sing your axe off.<br /><br />\n\u2022 -clectro-barmonix<br /><br />\n27West23rdStreet<br />\n\u2022 New`rfork,NY10010<br /><br />\nfrequented by few if any<br />\nstudents, regardless of their<br />\nhunger for fun and games. It's<br />\nopen from 9pm to 2 am<br />\nThursdays through Sundays,<br />\nalthough groups sometimes rent<br />\nit for private parties on Sundays.<br />\nThere's a liquor store doing a<br />\nrousing business on one side of<br />\nthe club and an alley on the<br />\nother. A regular group plays<br />\nFridays through Sundays and<br />\nnew bands play on Thursdays.<br />\nThere is no cover charge and<br />\ndrinks are of moderate price for<br />\nthe area.<br />\nThe New Club Anatomy is<br />\ntiny, and the front is pretty<br />\ntacky. Gold letters cut from<br />\ncardboard were splattered upon<br />\nthe glass window. A sign<br />\nadvertising packaged goods was<br />\nin one corner of the window,<br />\nalthough I never saw any inside.<br />\nThe most interesting thing about<br />\nthe place was also on the window<br />\n- two gold cardboard go-go girls.<br />\nThe go-go dancers were the only<br />\nconnection I could make to the<br />\nclub's name. This makes the New<br />\nClub Anatomy the closest place<br />\nto Hopkins that has \"dancers,\"<br />\n\u2022and if that's what you're used to,<br />\nthe place is for you. The club is<br />\nsmall, though, so chances are you<br />\nmight find them dancing on your<br />\ntable.<br />\nThe music sounded pretty<br />\ndecent from outside, so I walked<br />\nin and found myself eye to eye<br /><br />\nwith the bouncer's belt buckle.<br />\nAt least seven feet tall, the man _<br />\noccupied half the entire club. To<br />\nthe left of him was your regular<br />\nthree-sided bar, with a mirror<br />\nbehind it. Approximately fifty<br />\npeople could be seated at the<br />\nsmall wooden tables graced with<br />\nItalian- style red and white<br />\ncheckered tablecloths. The club<br />\ncould probably hold seventy<br />\npeople if the bouncer stood<br />\noutside. The decor of the club is<br />\ndisco: red lights and rotating ball,<br />\nwith the added feature of several<br />\nAfrican-style pices of sculpture<br />\nscattered around.<br />\nThe main attraction, a jazz<br />\nband, was at the back of the club<br />\non a ,raised stage. The group<br />\nplaying that night was a<br />\nthree-piece ensemble, consisting<br />\nof a .rap set, bass, and<br />\nkeyboards. I wasn't able to learn<br />\nthe name of the group, but their<br />\nmusic wasn't too bad, being that<br />\nnon-descript type ofjazz that I'm<br />\nsure almost everyone has heard at<br />\none time or another. The music<br />\nwas easy-listening, without the<br />\nfrills of progressive, Dixieland, or<br />\nswing. The crowd seemed to<br />\nenjoy the performance, and the<br />\nmood was low-key. The New<br />\nClub Anatomy is quite possibly<br />\nan asset to the North Avenue<br />\narea, but I seriously doubt any<br />\nstudents would be tempted to<br />\nspend an evening there.<br />\nThe New Club Anatcmy<br /><br />\nsymbolizes a problem that many<br />\njazz lovers at Hopkins face. There<br />\nare essentially two options open<br />\nto these people. They can<br />\nsomehow find transportation to a<br />\njazz spot in outer Baltimore or<br />\nDC and pay through the teeth to<br />\nhear any type of jazz music. The<br />\nother alternative is to go to a<br />\ncheap joint in downtown<br />\nBaltimore, worry about the<br />\nbuses, and glance paranoically<br />\nover your shoulder all night. The<br />\nRa thskellar occasionally offers<br />\njazz, from Peabody and as far<br />\naway as New York, but these<br />\n\"treats\" are all too infrequent.<br />\nThe perfect answer would be<br />\nan inexpensive club close to the<br />\nUniversity that could<br />\naccomodate a medium to large<br />\nnumber of patrons. Quite a few<br />\ngood jazz groups exist in<br />\nBaltimore, but a majority either<br />\nrefuse to play at certain clubs<br />\nbecause -of a possible compromise<br />\nto their musical talent, or clubs<br />\nreject them because the type of<br />\njazz they perform is too avant<br />\ngarde for business. I'd like to see<br />\na jazz club that would book any<br />\ntype of jazz music, even<br />\njamming. Fortunately, such a<br />\nplace might be in existence in our<br />\narea within six months to a year.<br />\nSo until that time, my jazz-loving<br />\nfriends, pay through the teeth,<br />\nglance over your shoulder, and<br />\nwait.
