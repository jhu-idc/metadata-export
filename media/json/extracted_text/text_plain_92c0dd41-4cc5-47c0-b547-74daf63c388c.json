I must confess that to the general reader<br />\narchaeology sounds far away and mysterious,<br />\naltogether out of touch with modern life and<br />\nthought, but I hope to show that it belongs to<br />\na branch of culture which we cannot afford to<br />\nneglect, and that the present vigorous prosecution of archaeological studies is a response<br />\nto the scientific spirit of the age.<br />\nIn his memorable inaugural address, after<br />\ndiscussing the intellectual education and moral<br />\neducation which the system of schools and<br />\nuniversities is intended to promote, John<br />\nStuart Mill continues: \"These are the two<br />\nmain ingredients of human culture; but they<br />\ndo not exhaust the whole of it. There is a<br />\nthird division, which, if subordinate and owing<br />\nallegiance to the two others, is barely inferior<br />\nto them, and not less useful to the completeness of the human being; I mean the aesthetic<br />\nbranch; the culture which comes through<br />\npoetry and art, and may be described as the<br />\neducation of the feelings and the cultivation of<br />\nthe beautiful.\"<br />\nMill then emphasizes the place which<br />\naesthetic culture occupies in any system of education which claims to be liberal, and shows<br />\nhow the natural results of the study of the<br />\nfine arts are refinement of the taste, enlargement of the sympathies, cultivation of the<br />\nimagination and promotion of the love of<br />\nbeauty.<br />\nNow as archaeology employs itself chiefly<br />\nwith the study of the fine arts of antiquity,<br />\nwith architecture and sculpture and painting\u2014<br />\nit contributes largely to the aesthetic culture<br />\n<br />\nNo. 7<br />\n<br />\nwhich Mill deems essential to the completeness<br />\nof the human being.<br />\nFurthermore, scientific method has demanded that the study of the ancient languages<br />\nshould be brought into close connection with<br />\nthe life of the peoples that spoke them. This<br />\nhas created a desire for facts as to their laws<br />\nand their customs, their beliefs and their cults.<br />\nFor these facts no source is so trustworthy<br />\nas the works of contemporary art, which may<br />\nbe regarded as the mirror in which antique<br />\nthought is reflected. Hence the material relics<br />\nof antiquity\u2014temples, and sculptures and<br />\nvases, the products of excavations at Athens<br />\nand Olympia and Delphi are now closely<br />\nwoven into the web of classical learning. And<br />\nthe science which treats this material and<br />\nmakes information concerning it accessible to<br />\nevery student of Greek and Roman literature<br />\nis classical archaeology.<br />\nWe are now prepared to show the relation<br />\nof archaeology to classical philology, and to<br />\ndefine its province and departments. The reconstruction of the human past of Greece and<br />\nRome is the grand ideal of classical philology<br />\nin its broadest sense. To accomplish this end,<br />\nit must collect, classify, and interpret the manifold record of antiquity. This record has come<br />\ndown to us in the spoken language where that<br />\nis preserved, in the works of literature, and in<br />\nthe monuments, i. e., in the extant remains of<br />\narchitecture, sculpture and the other arts\u2014in<br />\nfine, in all the results of human activity manifested in form and substance, as opposed to<br />\nthe unsubstantial means employed in literature. This last branch comprises the subject<br />\nmatter of classical archaeology and we may<br />\ndefine it as the scientific study of the monuments of classical antiquity which operate<br />\nthrough mass, form and color, according to<br />\ntheir peculiar modes of expression; or to put it<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nshortly and in its narrower sense, it is the inscriptions, and (3.) private life, the study of<br />\nancient manners, customs and institutions.<br />\nscientific study of antique art.<br />\nSuch then is the nature of classical archThe monuments of antiquity may be classiand such are the branches of study<br />\naeology,<br />\nfied as works of art and works of handicraft\u2014<br />\nthe fine arts and the useful arts.

U.; or box 398, Medical School<br />\nofJohns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\n<br />\nWe present as our leading article in this<br />\nissue a brief discussion of Classical Archaeology by Dr. Mitchell Carroll. Dr. Carroll, who<br />\nwas for some time a member of the American<br />\nSchool at Athens and derives his knowledge<br />\nof the subject at first hand, is now delivering<br />\ncourses of lectures on \"Greek Sculpture\" and<br />\n\"Antique Aesthetics.\" Courses on \"The<br />\nAcroplis\" and \"The Topography of Athens\"<br />\nwere completed before Christmas. In this<br />\nconnection many will remember the very entertaining lecture \"Home Life in Pompeii,\"<br />\ngiven last year by Professor Morgan, of Harvard. Such discussions show that archaeology<br />\nin spite of its scientific name, is a very interesting subject.<br />\nSome time ago favorable comment was<br />\nmade in our columns on a proposal to revive<br />\nthe dances formerly in vogue under the management of the Matriculate Society. Recently<br />\nit was announced that a series of dances had<br />\nbeen arranged, and the natural impression was<br />\nthat they were of this character. Far from reviving the old dances, however, those now in<br />\nprogress are on a plan entirely new at Hopkins. In the first place they are conducted by<br />\na self-conStituted board of managers, and<br />\nthough styled \"Hopkins dances,\" are restrict-<br />\n<br />\ned to a limited number, whom the managers<br />\nchoose to invite. In the second place, it appears that this prerogative, apparently derived<br />\nirom the authorities, has been used in an arbitrary manner. Acceptability in a certain circle<br />\nseems to be one requirement, affiliation with<br />\ncertain fraternities another. The status of the<br />\ndances is thus left uncertain. The presence of<br />\na member of the faculty on the board of managers adds to the official character implied by<br />\nthe name and place. At the same time it is<br />\nprivately declared that the dances are by no<br />\nmeans public affairs.<br />\nThe result is general and well-justified<br />\ndissatisfaction among the students. The<br />\naction of the managers was unwise, and<br />\nthe effect unfortunate. We question decidedly whether private dances have any<br />\nplace in McCoy Hall, a building in which<br />\nwe are supposed to have common rights. It<br />\nis certainly true that if such dances are held<br />\nthey ought to be given by a definite organization and under a distinctive name. We can<br />\nhardly believe, however, that the authorities<br />\ncontemplate granting the use of the hall for<br />\nexclusive dances given by various cliques of<br />\nstudents. Divisions enough exist already.<br />\nHostility between fraternity factions and nonfraternity men has worked evil in our college<br />\nlife before now, and one of the worst features<br />\nof the present affair is that it revives this feeling. When opposition of the two forces<br />\nbrought about a dead-lock in the junior class<br />\nof last year, both sides recognized the harm of<br />\nit, and an amicable adjustment was reached.<br />\nMany hoped that this would continue. It<br />\nseems that the hope was vain. Perhaps still<br />\nmore unfortunate, is the element of class distinction introduced by the managers.<br />\nThere is no room for modern society<br />\nmethods in our college life, and there is no<br />\nplace where snobbishness is more undtsirable.<br />\nOpinions may differ as to the proportion of<br />\n\"sheep and goats\" among Hopkins students,<br />\nbut we cannot feel that the undesirable element<br />\nincludes a large majority of them.

A beholder would not have been particularly edified at 'Saturday's game, except, possibly, in<br />\nregard to the superabundance of errors and<br />\nthe wrangling over adverse decisions which<br />\noccupied the greater part of each inning. The<br />\nplaying was by no means of the highest order,<br />\nexcept in a few cases, but the fact that the<br />\nteams did not have all of their regular men out<br />\nmay have been partly responsible for this.<br />\nThe indoor baseball season started in with<br />\na loud flourish of trumpets, and the first few<br />\ngames were marked by great enthusiasm and<br />\nfine team work. But the enthusiasm soon<br />\nwaned, and the remaining games were postponed again and again, until they were in danger of sharing the fate common to too many<br />\nathletic enterprises at the University, which<br />\nbegin their careers so brilliantly, only to glimmer and go out, and be forgotten.<br />\nThe outdoor baseball season will soon be<br />\nupon us, and this indoor practice should develop material for the 'Varsity team. Our<br />\nbaseball record for the past few years has not<br />\nbeen a particularly glorious one, and prospective candidates for this season's team should<br />\ntake the utmost advantage of the opportunities<br />\nhere offered. Do not let the indoor games end<br />\nin mere sport and amusement. Make them tell<br />\nin the way of practice.<br />\nSaturday's game between the Seniors and<br />\nthe Freshmen resulted in a victory for the<br />\nformer by a score of 9 to 5, although the<br />\nFreshmen improved toward the last and made<br />\nall their runs in the last three innings, while<br />\nthe Seniors made theirs at the beginning of the<br />\ngame. Downs pitched well for '99, and for<br />\nseveral innings he, with the assistance of the<br />\n<br />\nfirst and third basemen, did all the work. 'Joyner made some wonderful catches at third,<br />\nstopping everything that came his way. Constantine, for the Freshmen, rivaled him in his<br />\nbrilliant work at third, and was several times<br />\napplauded for his fine plays. Grimes, Hanna,<br />\nGuggenheimer, Swindell, Miller, and Briscoe<br />\nall played well.<br />\nThe Freshmen were shut out up to the<br />\nseventh inning, but took a spurt then, and<br />\nmade all their runs in the next few innings.<br />\nThe umpiring was not the finest ever seen at<br />\nthe University, and this resulted in much dispute. The players were, Seniors: Mullen,<br />\nGrimes, Downs, Joyner, Jones, Hanna, Guggenheimer, and Ford; Freshmen: Constantine, Briscoe, Miller, Straus, Tyler, Swindell,<br />\nJames, Boyer, and Bruton.<br />\n<br />\nTHE EXHIBITION.<br />\n<br />\nFrom time to time intimations are given out<br />\nof the elaborate plans that are being made for<br />\nthe spring gymnastic exhibition.

A medal<br />\nprovided by Professor Adams will be given to<br />\nthe freshman whose strength tests show the<br />\ngreatest improvement during the year. More<br />\nprizes may be added to the list before the exhibition.<br />\nIf the contest for class teams is to be a success, there must be sonic faithful work in the<br />\ngym., especially by the juniors and seniors.<br />\nCompulsory gymnastics have so far failed to<br />\ncompel, at least the upper classmen.

The exercises will be similar to those<br />\nof last year. There will be addresses by President Gilman, Professor Remsen, and Mr. William Hilles. The stunt games in the cage will<br />\ninclude several new features and some old<br />\nones that have proved amusing. There will be<br />\na greased pole to climb, sack and obstruction<br />\nraces, \"chicken-fights,\" boxing with blackened<br />\ngloves, and other things of like nature. Refreshments, the feature from which the function derived its name will follow. Mr. Robert<br />\nH. Grimes will be master of ceremonies and<br />\nMr. William H.

I must confess that to the general reader<br />\narchaeology sounds far away and mysterious,<br />\naltogether out of touch with modern life and<br />\nthought, but I hope to show that it belongs to<br />\na branch of culture which we cannot afford to<br />\nneglect, and that the present vigorous prosecution of archaeological studies is a response<br />\nto the scientific spirit of the age.<br />\nIn his memorable inaugural address, after<br />\ndiscussing the intellectual education and moral<br />\neducation which the system of schools and<br />\nuniversities is intended to promote, John<br />\nStuart Mill continues: \"These are the two<br />\nmain ingredients of human culture; but they<br />\ndo not exhaust the whole of it. There is a<br />\nthird division, which, if subordinate and owing<br />\nallegiance to the two others, is barely inferior<br />\nto them, and not less useful to the completeness of the human being; I mean the aesthetic<br />\nbranch; the culture which comes through<br />\npoetry and art, and may be described as the<br />\neducation of the feelings and the cultivation of<br />\nthe beautiful.\"<br />\nMill then emphasizes the place which<br />\naesthetic culture occupies in any system of education which claims to be liberal, and shows<br />\nhow the natural results of the study of the<br />\nfine arts are refinement of the taste, enlargement of the sympathies, cultivation of the<br />\nimagination and promotion of the love of<br />\nbeauty.<br />\nNow as archaeology employs itself chiefly<br />\nwith the study of the fine arts of antiquity,<br />\nwith architecture and sculpture and painting\u2014<br />\nit contributes largely to the aesthetic culture<br /><br />\nNo. 7<br /><br />\nwhich Mill deems essential to the completeness<br />\nof the human being.<br />\nFurthermore, scientific method has demanded that the study of the ancient languages<br />\nshould be brought into close connection with<br />\nthe life of the peoples that spoke them. This<br />\nhas created a desire for facts as to their laws<br />\nand their customs, their beliefs and their cults.<br />\nFor these facts no source is so trustworthy<br />\nas the works of contemporary art, which may<br />\nbe regarded as the mirror in which antique<br />\nthought is reflected. Hence the material relics<br />\nof antiquity\u2014temples, and sculptures and<br />\nvases, the products of excavations at Athens<br />\nand Olympia and Delphi are now closely<br />\nwoven into the web of classical learning.

The reconstruction of the human past of Greece and<br />\nRome is the grand ideal of classical philology<br />\nin its broadest sense. To accomplish this end,<br />\nit must collect, classify, and interpret the manifold record of antiquity. This record has come<br />\ndown to us in the spoken language where that<br />\nis preserved, in the works of literature, and in<br />\nthe monuments, i. e., in the extant remains of<br />\narchitecture, sculpture and the other arts\u2014in<br />\nfine, in all the results of human activity manifested in form and substance, as opposed to<br />\nthe unsubstantial means employed in literature. This last branch comprises the subject<br />\nmatter of classical archaeology and we may<br />\ndefine it as the scientific study of the monuments of classical antiquity which operate<br />\nthrough mass, form and color, according to<br />\ntheir peculiar modes of expression; or to put it<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nshortly and in its narrower sense, it is the inscriptions, and (3.) private life, the study of<br />\nancient manners, customs and institutions.<br />\nscientific study of antique art.<br />\nSuch then is the nature of classical archThe monuments of antiquity may be classiand such are the branches of study<br />\naeology,<br />\nfied as works of art and works of handicraft\u2014<br />\nthe fine arts and the useful arts.

U.; or box 398, Medical School<br />\nofJohns Hopkins Hospital.<br /><br />\nWe present as our leading article in this<br />\nissue a brief discussion of Classical Archaeology by Dr. Mitchell Carroll. Dr. Carroll, who<br />\nwas for some time a member of the American<br />\nSchool at Athens and derives his knowledge<br />\nof the subject at first hand, is now delivering<br />\ncourses of lectures on \"Greek Sculpture\" and<br />\n\"Antique Aesthetics.\" Courses on \"The<br />\nAcroplis\" and \"The Topography of Athens\"<br />\nwere completed before Christmas. In this<br />\nconnection many will remember the very entertaining lecture \"Home Life in Pompeii,\"<br />\ngiven last year by Professor Morgan, of Harvard. Such discussions show that archaeology<br />\nin spite of its scientific name, is a very interesting subject.<br />\nSome time ago favorable comment was<br />\nmade in our columns on a proposal to revive<br />\nthe dances formerly in vogue under the management of the Matriculate Society. Recently<br />\nit was announced that a series of dances had<br />\nbeen arranged, and the natural impression was<br />\nthat they were of this character. Far from reviving the old dances, however, those now in<br />\nprogress are on a plan entirely new at Hopkins. In the first place they are conducted by<br />\na self-conStituted board of managers, and<br />\nthough styled \"Hopkins dances,\" are restrict-<br /><br />\ned to a limited number, whom the managers<br />\nchoose to invite. In the second place, it appears that this prerogative, apparently derived<br />\nirom the authorities, has been used in an arbitrary manner. Acceptability in a certain circle<br />\nseems to be one requirement, affiliation with<br />\ncertain fraternities another. The status of the<br />\ndances is thus left uncertain. The presence of<br />\na member of the faculty on the board of managers adds to the official character implied by<br />\nthe name and place. At the same time it is<br />\nprivately declared that the dances are by no<br />\nmeans public affairs.<br />\nThe result is general and well-justified<br />\ndissatisfaction among the students. The<br />\naction of the managers was unwise, and<br />\nthe effect unfortunate. We question decidedly whether private dances have any<br />\nplace in McCoy Hall, a building in which<br />\nwe are supposed to have common rights. It<br />\nis certainly true that if such dances are held<br />\nthey ought to be given by a definite organization and under a distinctive name. We can<br />\nhardly believe, however, that the authorities<br />\ncontemplate granting the use of the hall for<br />\nexclusive dances given by various cliques of<br />\nstudents. Divisions enough exist already.<br />\nHostility between fraternity factions and nonfraternity men has worked evil in our college<br />\nlife before now, and one of the worst features<br />\nof the present affair is that it revives this feeling. When opposition of the two forces<br />\nbrought about a dead-lock in the junior class<br />\nof last year, both sides recognized the harm of<br />\nit, and an amicable adjustment was reached.<br />\nMany hoped that this would continue. It<br />\nseems that the hope was vain. Perhaps still<br />\nmore unfortunate, is the element of class distinction introduced by the managers.<br />\nThere is no room for modern society<br />\nmethods in our college life, and there is no<br />\nplace where snobbishness is more undtsirable.<br />\nOpinions may differ as to the proportion of<br />\n\"sheep and goats\" among Hopkins students,<br />\nbut we cannot feel that the undesirable element<br />\nincludes a large majority of them.

A beholder would not have been particularly edified at 'Saturday's game, except, possibly, in<br />\nregard to the superabundance of errors and<br />\nthe wrangling over adverse decisions which<br />\noccupied the greater part of each inning. The<br />\nplaying was by no means of the highest order,<br />\nexcept in a few cases, but the fact that the<br />\nteams did not have all of their regular men out<br />\nmay have been partly responsible for this.<br />\nThe indoor baseball season started in with<br />\na loud flourish of trumpets, and the first few<br />\ngames were marked by great enthusiasm and<br />\nfine team work. But the enthusiasm soon<br />\nwaned, and the remaining games were postponed again and again, until they were in danger of sharing the fate common to too many<br />\nathletic enterprises at the University, which<br />\nbegin their careers so brilliantly, only to glimmer and go out, and be forgotten.<br />\nThe outdoor baseball season will soon be<br />\nupon us, and this indoor practice should develop material for the 'Varsity team. Our<br />\nbaseball record for the past few years has not<br />\nbeen a particularly glorious one, and prospective candidates for this season's team should<br />\ntake the utmost advantage of the opportunities<br />\nhere offered. Do not let the indoor games end<br />\nin mere sport and amusement. Make them tell<br />\nin the way of practice.<br />\nSaturday's game between the Seniors and<br />\nthe Freshmen resulted in a victory for the<br />\nformer by a score of 9 to 5, although the<br />\nFreshmen improved toward the last and made<br />\nall their runs in the last three innings, while<br />\nthe Seniors made theirs at the beginning of the<br />\ngame. Downs pitched well for '99, and for<br />\nseveral innings he, with the assistance of the<br /><br />\nfirst and third basemen, did all the work. 'Joyner made some wonderful catches at third,<br />\nstopping everything that came his way. Constantine, for the Freshmen, rivaled him in his<br />\nbrilliant work at third, and was several times<br />\napplauded for his fine plays. Grimes, Hanna,<br />\nGuggenheimer, Swindell, Miller, and Briscoe<br />\nall played well.<br />\nThe Freshmen were shut out up to the<br />\nseventh inning, but took a spurt then, and<br />\nmade all their runs in the next few innings.<br />\nThe umpiring was not the finest ever seen at<br />\nthe University, and this resulted in much dispute. The players were, Seniors: Mullen,<br />\nGrimes, Downs, Joyner, Jones, Hanna, Guggenheimer, and Ford; Freshmen: Constantine, Briscoe, Miller, Straus, Tyler, Swindell,<br />\nJames, Boyer, and Bruton.<br /><br />\nTHE EXHIBITION.<br /><br />\nFrom time to time intimations are given out<br />\nof the elaborate plans that are being made for<br />\nthe spring gymnastic exhibition.

A medal<br />\nprovided by Professor Adams will be given to<br />\nthe freshman whose strength tests show the<br />\ngreatest improvement during the year. More<br />\nprizes may be added to the list before the exhibition.<br />\nIf the contest for class teams is to be a success, there must be sonic faithful work in the<br />\ngym., especially by the juniors and seniors.<br />\nCompulsory gymnastics have so far failed to<br />\ncompel, at least the upper classmen.

The exercises will be similar to those<br />\nof last year. There will be addresses by President Gilman, Professor Remsen, and Mr. William Hilles. The stunt games in the cage will<br />\ninclude several new features and some old<br />\nones that have proved amusing. There will be<br />\na greased pole to climb, sack and obstruction<br />\nraces, \"chicken-fights,\" boxing with blackened<br />\ngloves, and other things of like nature. Refreshments, the feature from which the function derived its name will follow. Mr. Robert<br />\nH. Grimes will be master of ceremonies and<br />\nMr. William H. Mackdermott, clerk of the<br />\ncourse. Plans for the evening have been made<br />\nby a general committee, of which Mr. Grimes<br />\nis chairman and Mr. George W. Knapp, Jr.,<br />\ntreasurer.

Although we<br />\nhave lost our coach, Mr. Mackdermott, there<br />\nis no cause for despair, for we have enough<br />\nwell-trained athletes at the University to uphold our fame.<br />\nCaptain Mullen, of the track team, has put<br />\nhis team on training diet, and the men have<br />\n_been out in practice for several days. The<br />\nHopkins team will probably consist of Garrett,<br />\nSimmons and Griffin in the weights; Fishach<br />\nand Simmons in the pole vault; Baetjer, Kerr<br />\nand Simmons in the jumps; Fitzgerald,<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nKnapp, Clark, Mullen, Riggs, De Grange,<br />\nRadcliffe, Morrison, Remsen and Frank in the<br />\nsprints. A number of Medical School men<br />\nwill probably enter also.<br />\nThe candidates for the track team are beginning to appear daily in the \"cage,\" and Captain Mullen expects a large field from which to<br />\nmake his final choice. All of last year's champion relay team are back at college, and it is<br />\nreported that there are many promising men<br />\namong the freshmen. It is to be hoped that<br />\nall students who have any athletic abilities<br />\nwhatsoever will endeavor to develop them.<br />\nCaptain Robinson, of the Lacrosse team, has<br />\nissued a call for all candidates to appear daily<br />\nin the \"cage\" in the afternoon. It is especially<br />\ndesirable that new men should turn out early<br />\nin order to gain the much needed stick work,<br />\nlack of which is always an obstacle to effective<br />\nlacrosse playing.
