The article concerned the<br />\nGarfinckel's Department Store<br />\npolicy, stating that black women<br />\nwere not allowed to try on merchandise because white women<br />\nwould not want to buy the same<br />\nitems tried on by blacks. \"This<br />\nwas a staple reality of 1965,\"<br />\nWilliams said.<br />\nRecounting this history,<br />\nWilliams suggested that society is<br />\nnot divorced from the past, but<br />\nrather that the society is still in<br />\nneed of change. \"We are the<br />\nhistory makers,\" Williams said,<br />\n\"We need to take up that<br />\nchallenge and put ourselves on<br />\nthe line.\"<br />\nStudents shaped much of the<br />\nhistory of the civil rights movement, according to Williams, and<br />\nhave the potential to continue this<br />\ninvolvement.

Without any publicity or advertisement of the program, five undergraduates have<br />\nalready declared majors in the<br />\nfield.

But, what<br />\nis education, what is it that we<br />\nlearn in life?\"<br />\nCousins said that the main pur-<br />\n<br />\npose of education was to help an<br />\nindividual come into \"full possession of his/her powers.\" Cousins<br />\nalso elaborated on his visit to the<br />\nU.S.S.R. and the metamorphosis<br />\nof the Soviet Union.

There<br />\nare long lines in front of the foodbank and deep dissatisfaction<br />\namong the citizens and it is uncertain whether economic change<br />\nwill catch up, he explained.<br />\nCousins advocates outside intervention.

Particularly<br />\npressing for students, and troubling for administrators, is<br />\nHopkins' earned reputation as a relentlessly academic school,<br />\nwithout time or space for socializing among students. Last Saturday night the Grad Club hosted its first big dance party of the<br />\nyear. Two live bands played to a large, enthusiastic student<br />\ncrowd\u2014an outbreak of that elusive social life and, for that evening, at least, a student gathering place. The bands played from<br />\n10:00 p.m. until approximately 1:15 a.m. The evening was successful from a financial standpoint as well as a programming/organizational standpoint.<br />\nApparently, however, some McCoy residents found the noise<br />\nfrom this successful event objectionable. Noise in McCoy has<br />\nalways been an obstacle for the club and an issue of negotiation between the club, the residents, and Residential Life. Last<br />\nyear these negotiations led to the cancellation of Thursday night<br />\nFunk Nite, volume limits, the addition of sound absorption<br />\npanels, and other programming modifications.<br />\nThis week negotiations were by-passed, and a decree was<br />\nhanded down: no amplified music, probably for the rest of the<br />\nyear. The new club management was not given an opportunity<br />\nto meet with McCoy residents or to investigate the noise situation themselves. It is not clear how many residents complained. When the club received the first complaint at 10:15 p.m.,<br />\nthe manager turned down the volume and closed the doors and<br />\nwindows. No further complaints were received directly by the<br />\nclub, leading the manager to believe that these steps had offered at least some relief.<br />\nCertainly the needs of McCoy residents need to be addressed. The current management of the Grad Club wants very much<br />\n<br />\nto \"meet them halfway.\" The Grad Club is operating from an<br />\nalready greatly compromised position, given the concessions<br />\nmade last year, but the managers are willing to bend further<br />\nin order to accommodate those with complaints. But the decision was made before any such dialogue could take place.<br />\nThe Grad Club exists for students and is operated primarily<br />\nby students. It fills many gaps in Hopkins life\u2014gaps left by<br />\na lack of on-campus housing and a poor substitute for a student union. This year, with new hours and the addition of coffee to the menu, a broader slice of the student population has<br />\ntaken advantage of the space and atmosphere. Students meet<br />\nfor a cozy chat, a cup of coffee, or a break from the fluorescent glare of the library. Student groups schedule meetings<br />\nthere, avoiding the battle for on-campus space and offering their<br />\nmembers a more casual but still productive atmosphere, with<br />\npossibilities for socializing after the meeting.<br />\nDuring the week the club does not sell enough beer, coffee,<br />\nor pizza to pay the wages of the student staff. While this does<br />\nnot mean that the overall benefits to students do not justify the<br />\ninvestment, it makes for a weaker case when confronting a(supposedly) financially strapped administration. However, revenues<br />\nfrom last Saturday indicate that the club could operate in the<br />\nblack with five quiet nights and one music night each week.<br />\nThis schedule represents sensitivity to the needs of both the \"student population at large\" and McCoy residents. Students have<br />\nboth meeting and social space during the week, and an alternative to fraternity parties and the local bars on the weekend.<br />\nAll of this can be maintained with only three hours of amplified<br />\nmusic each week. If three hours of music each week, on a<br />\nweekend night, with the music off by 1:00 a.m., and the volume<br />\nkept below a certain level is not considered a generous compromise, what would be?<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nA Victim Asks: Wherefore Security?

Almost half of the white<br />\ncitizens in this country are too young<br />\nto have experienced American society in the pre-Civil Rights era. They<br />\ndid not get a firsthand glimpse of the<br />\neffects of racism on the nation's<br />\nblacks.

All of us<br />\nhave been affected by the people<br />\nwho bombed churches, burned<br />\ncrosses, and brutalized innocent<br />\npeople.<br />\nSo when people like Mr. McCrea<br />\nsay that \"these whites do not feel<br />\nthat they should be held accountable<br />\nfor a problem to which they did not<br />\ncontribute,\" I say BULL! We are all<br />\nresponsible for addressing the problem of institutional racism.

Racial tension did not go<br />\naway; the Civil Rights Movement effectively put racism in check.

If that were the case, there<br />\nwould be no need for affirmative action. Regardless of your views concerning African-Americans in<br />\nsports, Mr. McCrea, you must<br />\nrealize that in the race of life whites<br />\nget a couple hundred meter head<br />\nstart simply because of their skin color.

And<br />\nno one should have to. With the<br />\nincreased violence in the campus<br />\narea, the escort service is imperative. A first year graduate<br />\nstudent was murdered in 1989. A<br />\nhousemaster was attacked outside<br />\nMcCoy last spring. A woman<br />\nwas assailed in Garland parking<br />\nlot at dusk. The number of<br />\nassaults and attacks continues to<br />\nescalate.<br />\nThese incidents usually result<br />\nin a Security Bulletin being<br />\nposted on campus. With a majority of Hopkins students living in<br />\nprivate accommodations, they<br />\n<br />\nnever receive direct information<br />\non the dangers surrounding them.<br />\nThat's why the escort van program is so important. It's hard to<br />\nbelieve it was implemented only<br />\nabout 10 years ago. (It's equally<br />\npainful to remember that the<br />\nsecurity office didn't feel it<br />\nnecessary to stay open 24 hours<br />\nuntil last year.) And even then it<br />\nwas designed to get students from<br />\noff-campus to on-campus,<br />\npresumably to the MSE. Two<br />\nyears later a second van was added because of increased ridership.<br />\nNow, with the addition of a third<br />\nvan, there has been a decrease in<br />\nthe rate of increase usage.<br />\nThree vans service the entire<br />\nHopkins community. That seems<br />\nlike a rather small number,<br />\nespecially considering that two<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nReconsidering Bill Baird<br />\nContinued from page 4<br />\nevent.<br />\nOn numerous occasions, prochoice speaker Baird unabashedly<br />\nboasted about his legal forays in the<br />\nland of litigation. While claiming<br />\nthat he would make not a cent from<br />\nhis speaking engagement, he didn't<br />\nhesitate to lace his stance on issues<br />\nwith heavy doses of advertisement<br />\nfor the NY abortion clinic that bears<br />\nhis name. And after having ignored<br />\nthe time limit on his closing<br />\nremarks\u2014for about fifteen<br />\nseconds\u2014he proceeded to rudely interrupt pro-life speaker Faucher<br />\n(who would do well to brush up on<br />\nargumentation) on at least three occasions during her closing statement,<br />\nprompting her finally to ask him to<br />\nplease be quiet. Meanwhile, the imperturbable student moderator said<br />\nnothing.<br />\nThe close of the Q&A session left<br />\nseveral students standing at the floor<br />\nmike. But after the debate, the<br />\nspeakers willingly continued to field<br />\nquestions. About fifteen students and<br />\nI were privy to the following verbal<br />\nexchange between Baird and the student who agreed to let the author of<br />\nthis letter copy from the original<br />\nstatement of his question.<br />\nBaird.: What's your question?<br />\nStudent : Mr. Baird, from your vast<br />\nexperience in the US court system,<br />\nyou probably know well the importance of definitions.<br />\nBaird : Yes.<br />\nStudent : During your rebuttal, you<br />\nreferred to pro-life rhetoric. . .<br />\nBaird : (Interrupting) Anti-abortion<br />\nrhetoric, not pro-life. They insist on<br />\ncalling our movement pro-abortion,<br />\nrather than pro-choice. It's not prolife but anti-abortion. Understood?<br />\nStudent : During your rebuttal, you<br />\nreferred to anti-abortion rhetoric as<br />\nthe \"rape of language\" (see NewsLetter article by Marsh).<br />\nBaird : (Interrupting) Is that not exactly what it is? The substitution<br />\nof. ..(lengthy discourse of rhetoric).<br />\nStudent : May I continue? But my<br />\nobject here is not to dicuss antiabortion terminology, whether or not<br />\nthose terms have been carefully<br />\nchosen. Rather, let me ask you about<br />\nyour suggestion that anti-abortionists<br />\nbe more honest and utilize terms like<br />\n\"fetus\" and \"embryo\". . .<br />\nBaird : (Interrupting, and continuing<br />\nwith polemics on terminology) I<br />\nalready know what you're going to<br />\nask.<br />\nStudent: (Shocked) You do?<br />\nBaird: Yeah.<br />\nStudent: Then why don't you tell us<br />\nmy question.<br />\nBaird: You're going to ask about the<br />\nage at which the developing fetus can<br />\nbe considered a human being. . .Right?<br />\nStudent: No. That's not my question.<br />\nLet me ask you about your suggestion that anti-abortionists be more<br />\nhonest and utilize terms like \"fetus\"<br />\nand \"embryo,\" as if these terms<br />\nwere well-defined, unambiguous,<br />\nand mathematically precise as<br />\n\"point\" or \"line.\" Perhaps you<br />\nwould be willing to explain to this<br />\naudience. . .<br />\nBaird: (Interupting) What's your<br />\nquestion?<br />\nStudent: I think this preface is<br />\nnecessary. Explain what are the<br />\nuniversally accepted definitions of<br />\n\"fetus\" and \"embryo\" and \"person\" and \"human being\" and<br />\n\"privacy,\" and whe.ther or not it<br />\nwould be \"rape of language\" to apply these terms without the...caveat<br />\nthat their definitions are not arbitrarily accurate.<br />\nFinally, Marsh informs us that<br />\n\"I Baird presented shocking pictures<br />\nand stories of women who had died<br />\nfrom abortions performed incorrectly.\" Maybe she had alreadly left<br />\n<br />\nShriver Hall by the time I overheard<br />\nFaucher remark to a student that<br />\nBaird refuses to debate anyone who<br />\nbrings on stage photos of aborted<br />\nfetuses.<br />\nDonald Haynie<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to commend J.P.

First of<br />\nall, the Hopkins non-discrimination<br />\n<br />\nvans served the burgeoning<br />\npopulation for seven years. Now,<br />\nas Homewood is experiencing the<br />\nlargest class enlargement (and<br />\ncash infusion) program ever,<br />\nanother van has been added. But<br />\nwas security keeping pace with<br />\ngrowth before? It appears<br />\nunlikely.<br />\nConsider these troubling problems: last year the security office stopped giving an estimated<br />\ntime of arrival (ETA)to callers.<br />\nNow the van will arrive \"as soon<br />\nas possible,\" although this can<br />\nrange from five to thirty minutes.<br />\nWhat makes this so frustrating is<br />\nthat this forces individuals to wait<br />\noutside in many cases.<br />\nIf the ostensible reason for having an escort service is to provide<br />\na modicum of safety for students<br />\nin an increasingly threatening environment, what good does it do<br />\nto force people out of doors for<br />\nan unreasonable amount of time?<br />\nWhat does the security office<br />\nsuggest to remedy a lengthy wait?<br />\nCall again.<br />\nWell, yes. But that hardly<br />\nmakes up for the time wasted,<br />\nand it lenghtens the caller's time<br />\nas a sitting duck. Why doesn't<br />\nsecurity gives ETAs any more?<br />\nIt takes up too much airtime on<br />\nthe dispatching system. And why<br />\n<br />\ndoes it take too much airtime?<br />\nBecause the lone dispatcher also<br />\nhandles all general information<br />\ncalls, dispatches to housekeeping,<br />\nand acts as a receptionist for<br />\nanyone wandering into the security office. Maybe security needs<br />\none person just for the vans.<br />\nAnd don't let the fact that there<br />\nare three vans operating convince<br />\nyou that you'll receive efficient<br />\nservice. Many students get<br />\nfrustrated after seeing several<br />\nvans pass them by after they call<br />\nin a pick-up. That's because one<br />\nvan picks up only on campus.<br />\nThere are also regular stops at the<br />\nMSE, every 30 minutes on the<br />\nhalf hour, the same for Levering,<br />\nand the Rotunda\u2014every hour on<br />\nthe hour.<br />\nThat might sound like a smart<br />\nsystem, but when you realize that<br />\none van won't pick up anyone not<br />\non campus, you know there's a<br />\nserious problem. The Rotunda<br />\nstop is interesting for several<br />\nreasons. Any of the escort vans<br />\nwill drop you off there at any<br />\ntime. But when calling for a pick<br />\nup at say, 7:11, a student has to<br />\nwait until the scheduled 8 pm<br />\nstop, even though other shuttles<br />\nmay be stopping to drop off!<br />\nAnother incident that occurred<br />\nwas that a driver refused to carry<br />\n<br />\nPI3PA1-04?<br />\n<br />\nIN/ AN 0rH3z<br />\n<br />\nLF 1-40eit.<br />\n<br />\n4\\1\\ \\\\\\<br />\nVAN<br />\n<br />\nDKivER_S CONE BAD<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nthe young children of a Hopkins than three but under five can be<br />\ncouple.

Don Jose, the corporal of the Dragoons and the<br />\nprotagonist, is in love with his<br />\nsweetheart Micaela from his<br />\nhome town. Micaela is visiting<br />\nJose in Seville and bringing him<br />\nnews from home. She leaves Jose<br />\nfor a time, and we are introduced to a seductress, Carmen, a<br />\ncigarette girl. Every day during<br />\na break at the factory, the<br />\ncigarette girls empty into the<br />\nsquare to flirt with and seduce the<br />\nsoldiers. The Gypsy Carmen<br />\nflirts, airing her philosophy of life<br />\nin the famous \"L'amour est un<br />\noiseau rebel/c\" (love is a wild<br />\nbird that can't be tamed).<br />\nCarmen, drawn by Jose's apparent indifference to her<br />\nfeminine wiles, begins her seduction of Jose with this aria.<br />\nJose, although not completely<br />\nunder Carmen's spell, is<br />\nnoticeably disturbed. After<br />\nCarmen leaves, Micaela returns,<br />\nand Jose pledges his love to her,<br />\nvowing to marry her. Once<br />\nMicaela leaves (this time for her<br />\nfar away home), Carmen is involved in a fight at the cigarette<br />\nfactory. Don Jose, under orders<br />\nfrom his superior officer, must<br />\narrest Carmen. While he is<br />\nholding Carmen, she sings to him<br />\n<br />\nand completes her seduction.<br />\nRather than go to jail, Don Jose<br />\nallows Carmen to escape; for<br />\nthis, Jose must go to jail for one<br />\nmonth.<br />\nCarmen returns to her life of<br />\npartying. During Jose's imprisonment, she attracts the attention of<br />\na famous matador, Escamillo,<br />\nwho sings of his exploits at the<br />\n<br />\nbullfight with the famous aria,<br />\n\"Votre toast,\" more commonly<br />\nknown as the theme to the Bad<br />\nNews Bears. Carmen, however,<br />\nremains loyal to Don Jose. Jose<br />\nreturns to Carmen at the inn that<br />\nnight, but one of Jose's officers<br />\nstops by the inn and he and Jose<br />\nget into a fight. Jose, now an<br />\noutlaw, joins Carmen in the<br />\n<br />\nmountains.<br />\nbecomes<br />\nquickly<br />\nJose<br />\nhomesick, and Carmen, known<br />\nfor her fickleness, grows increasingly bored with Jose.

Not an art film, the life of<br />\nparaplegic Christy Brown is a<br />\nmoving and accessable story that<br />\nis a winner for Family Weekend.<br />\nOn the other hand, the Senior<br />\nClass is showing the unmissable<br />\nFriday the 13th (Friday and<br />\nSaturday 8 & 10:15 in Shaffer 3),<br />\nthe 1980 original that spawned an<br />\nInterminable number of worse sequels. He Walked By Night<br />\n(Sunday at 7 & 9 in Shriver) is<br />\nthe 1948 story of a police-stalked<br />\nmurderer, told in documentary<br />\nstyle. Directed by Alfred Werker<br />\nand Anthony Mann, and starring<br />\nJack Webb.<br />\nThe 1935 version of Mutiny<br />\nun the Bounty, featuring a<br />\nknockout performance by Charles<br />\nLaughton, is showing as a part of<br />\nthe Shrine Film Festival tonight<br />\nonly.

The Grand Mass<br />\nis, for instance, a musical setting<br />\nof the Roman Catholic Mass.<br />\nHowever, the power of the piece<br />\nand its appeal goes beyond<br />\nborders of religious belief.

This<br />\nhistorical fiction deals with the<br />\nstruggle between performers and<br />\nproducers, as well as the role the<br />\nsubjugated should should take<br />\nagainst oppressors and exploiters.<br />\nA great set and strong performances from Thomas Martell<br />\nBrimm, Clabert Ford, and Ebony<br />\nJo-Ann (recreating the title role<br />\nfrom her Broadway run) and<br />\nothers make this an enjoyable<br />\nevening at Center Stage (700 N.<br />\nCalvert St., 332-0033).

The<br />\ncharacters of Don Jose, played by<br />\nJohn Absalom, and Escamillo,<br />\nplayed by Craig Heath Nim were<br />\nportrayed unspectacularly well,<br />\nwith nothing exciting about them.<br />\nBoth men sang and acted adequately, with the only real fault<br />\nbeing that Nim could have projected his voice better, especially during \"Votre toast\", a song<br />\nthat calls for volume.<br />\nThe real talent came from a<br />\nusually unappreciated source: the<br />\norchestra. Enrique Batiz's con-<br />\n<br />\nducting was brilliant as he produced a powerful and entertaining interpretation to an opera that<br />\nhas often been butchered. I have<br />\nheard many versions of Carmen,<br />\nand Batiz has given one of the<br />\nbest orchestral performances.<br />\nBecause the score is so widely<br />\nrecognised and important to<br />\nCarmen, the orchestra made an<br />\notherwise mediocre performance<br />\nby the cast worthwhile. Credit is<br />\nalso due to the lighting and set<br />\ndesigners.Lighting was very effective in paralleling the mood of<br />\nthe story; the slowly brightening<br />\nred light during the final scene<br />\nmatching the building desperation<br />\nand rage of Jose which finally<br />\n<br />\nprice tickets ($4-$14) available to<br />\nstudents on the day of performance.

Sharon Reynolds, representative from the Sexual Assault<br />\nRecovery Center and perhaps better known on campus as the<br />\nAssistant Director of Residential<br />\nLife led the program, offering<br />\nvaluable tips on self-defense and<br />\nprotection from sexual assault.<br />\nIn the parking lot scenario,<br />\nSharon suggested consolidating<br />\npackages to allow for a free hand,<br />\nholding a key before getting to the<br />\ncar, and even entering through<br />\nthe passenger's door and climbing through to the driver's side.<br />\n\"You may feel a little silly,\"<br />\nshe acknowledged, \"but it may<br />\njust make the difference and mean<br />\nyour safety.\"<br />\nMs. Reynolds emphasized the<br />\nimportance of remaining aware of<br />\none's surroundings at all times.<br />\nShe drew an analogy to<br />\nautomobile safety. \"When you're<br />\ndriving a car, you're constantly<br />\nkeeping track of who's around<br />\nyou,\" she said.<br />\nShe continued to explain that it<br />\nis important to trust your intuitive<br />\nreaction to potentially dangerous<br />\nsituations. If possible, she suggests finding the closest well-lit<br />\nand populated area to discourage<br />\nattackers.<br />\nEqually important in selfdefense strategy is not allowing<br />\noneself to look like an easy target.<br />\n\"Look like you're in charge,\"<br />\nshe says. \"The less vulnerable<br />\n<br />\nyou look, the less likely you are<br />\nto be a victim.\"<br />\nIn addition to looking confident, Ms. Reynolds suggested<br />\nthat women wear flats instead of<br />\nheels, and always keep one hand<br />\nfree for defense. She cautioned<br />\nwomen on carrying self-defense<br />\napparatus such as mace and handguns, however because they can<br />\neasily be used against the victim.<br />\nInstead, she recommended selfdefense classes, which teach not<br />\nonly strategy for physically warding off attackers, but just as importantly how to stay calm in<br />\norder to be able to defend oneself<br />\nmore effectively.<br />\nMs. Reynolds also suggested<br />\npracticing drawing attention to<br />\nthe attack. She explained that<br />\noften women are mentally unprepared for an attack and find<br />\nthemselves unable to scream or<br />\nrun. Practicing screaming and<br />\nplanning methods of alerting attention can be vital to selfpreservation.<br />\nMs. Reynolds also acknowledged that in certain circumstances one can only hope to<br />\ntalk an attacker out of attacking.<br />\n\"Sometimes you're in a lifethreatening situation,\" she says.<br />\n\"The reality is it's better to be<br />\nalive. Sometimes you can't fight<br />\nback.\"<br />\nDuring the second half of the<br />\nprogram Ms. Reynolds opened<br />\nthe floor to discussion. Members<br />\nof the audience offered stories<br />\nand safety tips. As one woman<br />\nnoted, \"You shouldn't be deceived by the appearance of someone. Chances are he won't<br />\nlook like a rapist.\"<br />\nA free Women's Self Protection Workshop will be held on<br />\nTuesday, November 6 and Thursday November 8 in the AMR I<br />\nMulti-Purpose Room. The session will be led by Sharon Sirkis,<br />\nowner and instructor at Universal Kempo Karate. All interested<br />\nwomen students, staff and faculty are invited to attend.<br />\n<br />\nter of personality causing the<br />\ndisease, but rather the disease<br />\ncausing the personality.\"<br />\nIn a similar story, Prodey told<br />\nof a researcher who hypothesized that students who were impatient and arrogant and who had illegible penmanship were more<br />\nlikely to become doctors. The<br />\nresearcher found that these<br />\ncharacteristics, which she termed \"Physician's Personality<br />\nDisorder,\" were the result of the<br />\nprofession, not the cause. Normal<br />\npeople simply underwent a personality change.\u2022<br />\nSimilarly, most alcoholics are<br />\notherwise normal people, though<br />\nsome alcohol abusers do have<br />\ncharacter disorders or psychiatric<br />\ndisorders. Others, particularly<br />\nthose with an alcoholic parent,<br />\nmay have a genetic predisposition<br />\nto the disease.<br />\nBut even those predisposed or<br />\nat risk for alcoholism are not<br />\nnecessarily predestined to abuse<br />\nalcohol. As Prodey explained,<br />\n\"If you don't learn denial, you<br />\ncan't become a drunk.\" A loss of<br />\ncontrol begins the process of<br />\nalcohol abuse. Occasional drinks<br />\nbecome repeated drinks, repeated<br />\ndrinks become a habit, and the<br />\nhabit becomes an addiction.<br />\nAs Martin emphasized, the best<br />\nways to prevent the occasional<br />\nsocial drink from developing into a pattern of abuse are education and wellness. \"Alcohol has<br />\na place in our society. . . but if<br />\npeople are going to use alcohol,<br />\nthere are things they need to<br />\nknow.\"<br />\nThe large majority of people do<br />\ndrink responsibly. But \"by<br />\ndefinition, anybody with a problem has a problem, and that<br />\ndoesn't necessarily mean<br />\nalcoholism. It might mean missing classes, drinking and driving,<br />\nfighting with family or with a<br />\nboyfriend or girlfriend. . . these<br />\n<br />\nBret Akers<br />\n<br />\nCult of personality<br />\nPersonality will not predict alcohol abuse, says Richard Prodey.<br />\nall signify a problem. \"You don't<br />\nhave to be an alcoholic to have<br />\nproblems.\"<br />\nAccording to Martin, \"alcohol<br />\nabuse does not exist in a<br />\nvacuum.\" Problems with alcohol<br />\nare often just symptomatic of<br />\nunderlying problems with selfesteem. This is why, for example, anorexics and bulimics often<br />\nbecome alcoholic.<br />\nAccording to Martin, \"It fits in<br />\nwith our philosophy that alcohol<br />\nis only one of the wellness<br />\nissues. . . Many other things interact with alcohol. We have tried<br />\nnot to just look at alcohol in isolation.\"<br />\nWellness and education are the<br />\ntwo most effective ways of combatting alcoholism. \"The better<br />\npersonal skills we have, the better we feel about ourselves, the<br />\nless likely we'll harm ourselves.\"<br />\nThis was also the rationale behind<br />\nthe Wellness fair in the Glass<br />\nPavilion on Wednesday.<br />\nThe Wellness fair, while emphasizing responsible alcohol use<br />\nin accordance with National Col-<br />\n<br />\nlegiate Alcohol Awareness Week,<br />\nalso featured booths for APTT,<br />\nthe Randallstown High chapter of<br />\nSADD,and a variety of substance<br />\nabuse programs.<br />\nThe Faculty and Staff<br />\nAssistance program gave out<br />\ngreen baloons while the Hopkins<br />\nHospital Program for Alcohol<br />\nand Chemical Dependencies offered a sour ball in exchange for<br />\na correct answer about a question<br />\nabut alcohol. Outside, students<br />\ncould test their alcohol<br />\nknowledge on the \"Wheel of Information\" and win a pack of<br />\npumpkin seeds or condoms.<br />\nBut though the fair was designed to increase alcohol awareness<br />\nthrough fun events, Martin tried<br />\nto downplay the significance of<br />\nthis week as a major event. \"We<br />\ndidn't want a glitz and glitter<br />\nthing on just this one week,\" she<br />\ncommented. Hopkins instead emphasizes Wellness throughout the<br />\nyear, as seen, for example, in the<br />\nBrown Bag Lunch series.<br />\nMartin also blamed society for<br />\nmuch of the low self esteem<br />\n<br />\nwhich can cause alcohol abuse.<br />\nShe believes that society creates<br />\nthe belief that there is a product<br />\nfor every need: to make you feel<br />\ngood, to make you attractive to<br />\nthe opposite sex, to make you<br />\npopular. When people can't obtain<br />\nthe happy ideal promoted by the<br />\nproducts, they become depressed and often turn to alcohol or<br />\nother substances to make them<br />\nfeel better.<br />\nThis societal influence made<br />\nMartin's task that much more difficult. \"My job is to promote<br />\nwellness,\" she said, \"and this fits<br />\ninto a larger scheme of things. It's<br />\nreal difficult to tight something<br />\nthat's so widely entrenched in our<br />\nsociety. We're talking about a<br />\nsocietal issue here.\"<br />\nMartin admits that educating<br />\npeople about responsible alcohol<br />\nuse is an uphill fight, but she<br />\nbelieves that it can\u2014and will\u2014<br />\nbe done. \"I respect people's<br />\ndescision to drink\u2014within the<br />\nlaw. But if they're \u2022 going to<br />\nchoose to drink, these are the<br />\nthings they need to know.\"<br />\n<br />\nFood for Thought: Chi-Chi's<br />\nby Jessica Maxwell<br />\nThis week's food for thought<br />\nis Chi-Chi's on York and<br />\nTimonium Roads. This one<br />\ndefinitely requires a car.<br />\nHowever, since it is Parent's<br />\nWeekend, this escape from campus might be possible. It is easy<br />\nto get to (you can impress Mom<br />\nand Dad with your navigational<br />\nskills): follow Charles Street to<br />\n695 East to York Road, or take<br />\nYork Road directly, about two<br />\nmiles north to Timonium Road.<br />\nTurn left and Chi-Chi's will be<br />\non your left. They take AmEx,<br />\n<br />\nSCHOLARSHIPS<br />\nFELLOWSHIPS<br />\nGRANTS<br />\nEDS'S SERVICES<br />\nBOX 3006<br />\nBOSTON, MA 02l30<br />\n<br />\nVisa, MC, and Discover.<br />\nFor those of you who have<br />\nnever been there before, the first<br />\nthing they do at Chi-Chi's is bring<br />\nyou chips and salsa. So there really isn't any need to order an appetizer. They do have a few,<br />\nthough, most notably the Mexican Pizza. This has recently been<br />\none of their promotions, and it is<br />\nonly $6.95.<br />\nFor entrees, there are many to<br />\nchoose from. My favorite is the<br />\nChajita. It is brought out to you<br />\non its own skillet, so it is always<br />\nsizzling hot. It is served one of<br />\ntwo ways, either Ranch style or<br />\n<br />\nHacienda style. I recommend the<br />\nRanch. It comes with flour tortillas, lettuce, tomato, sour<br />\ncream, grated cheese and<br />\nguacamole. On the side, there is<br />\nalso Spanish rice. With Chajitas,<br />\nyou have the choice of chicken,<br />\npork, beef, or shrimp, or a combination of any two for the same<br />\nprice ($8.95).<br />\nAfter dinner, there are a few<br />\ndesserts; the fried ice cream is<br />\ngood, but I also like the sopapillas<br />\n($2.25). They come with<br />\nchocolate, honey or strawberry<br />\nsauce. Sopapillas are triangular<br />\npieces of fried dough. So if you<br />\n<br />\nlike fried dough (or triangles),<br />\nyou'll definitely like these. I also<br />\nrecommend one of Chi-Chi's coffee drinks to go along with<br />\ndessert. And for those of you who<br />\nare not legal, their regular coffee<br />\nis pretty good too.<br />\nChi-Chi's<br />\n23 W.

Before a small crowd of<br />\nparents and friends (mostly confined to the enclosed press box)<br />\nHopkins defeated MAC Northwest opponent Lebanon Valley<br />\nhere, 2-1, in the rain.<br />\nThe Flying Dutchmen of<br />\nLebanon Valley took a 1-0 lead<br />\nfifteen minutes into the first half.<br />\nAfter neither team managed any<br />\nsignificant attack, Valley forward<br />\nDawn Hickman carried the ball<br />\ndown the right sideline and<br />\nsizzled a pass to center. In a<br />\ncrowd, a Valley player shot the<br />\nball off the right post and it<br />\nbounced behind Blue Jay goalie<br />\nAlec King.<br />\nHopkins got right back in the<br />\ngame on a goal five minutes later.<br />\nSenior Jen Chun carried the ball<br />\nover the midfield line and down<br />\nthe right wing. She sent a pass to<br />\nfreshman phenom Beth Cariello,<br />\n<br />\nwho along with sophomore Roxanne Tena, had broken past the<br />\nValley defense for a two-on-one<br />\nadvantage. Fifteen yards out, on<br />\nthe right football hash-mark,<br />\nCariello shot toward the goal.<br />\nValley goalie Sue Leonard<br />\nmoved toward the ball but failed<br />\nto deflect it. Tena got to the loose<br />\nball behind Leonard and<br />\nknocked it in to tie the score at<br />\none.<br />\nHopkins continued to pressure<br />\nthe Valley goal. Less than three<br />\nminutes after her goal, Tena fired<br />\na shot that barely went wide to the<br />\nleft. Several minutes passed<br />\nwithout any real scoring opportunities for either team. Late in<br />\nthe first half, Hopkins recovered<br />\na loose ball in their defensive end<br />\nand Donna Williamson and<br />\nCariello carried the ball into the<br />\noffensive zone. Deep into the corner of the field Cariello, played<br />\nthe ball through three defenders.<br />\nAlthough Cariello lost the ball,<br />\nValley was called for an illegal<br />\nplay and the result was a penalty<br />\ncorner. With twenty-five seconds<br />\nto play in the half, Chun passed<br />\nthe ball in from the corner and<br />\nsenior co-captain Kathy Herring<br />\nblistered a shot past the Dutchmen goalie giving the Jays a 2-1<br />\nlead.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins looked ready to blow<br />\nthe game open with three more<br />\ncorners early in the second half.<br />\nHowever, they failed to convert<br />\non any of the chances. Midway<br />\nthrough the half the Dutchmen<br />\nwere called for another penalty<br />\ncorner after a superior effort by<br />\nChun who carried the ball from<br />\nmidfield past three defenders and<br />\nbarely got a shot away. Chun<br />\npassed in to Herring who this<br />\ntime stopped the ball for Sue<br />\nBerner. Playing with only one<br />\ncontact lens, Burner drilled a shot<br />\nthat the Valley goalie barely<br />\nkicked wide. After a brief unsettled period, Cariello released<br />\nanother shot that was deflected<br />\naway. Hopkins continued to apply solid pressure for several<br />\nmore minutes.<br />\nLebanon Valley was equal to<br />\nthe task. Hopkins failed to score<br />\nand the Dutchmen recovered for<br />\nseveral excellent scoring opportunities. Fortunately, each time<br />\nValley managed to penetrate<br />\nacross midfield, the defensive<br />\nplay of Sonia Dickson, Kathy<br />\nSolsolowski, and Courtney<br />\nDeVries stifled Valley.

However, in this week's<br />\nepisode the Jays traveled into the<br />\nnation's capital to battle the<br />\nGeorgetown Hoyas. Thoughts of<br />\nLinda Blair must have danced in<br />\ntheir heads as the Blue Jays lost<br />\nto the Hoyas 17-3. The loss dropped the Hopkins' record to 3-4<br />\noverall.<br />\n\"They're a pretty talented football team,- said Head Coach Jim<br />\nMargraff. \"We needed a big<br />\ngame from both sides of the ball.<br />\nThe defense played a very nice<br />\ngame, but the offense did not get<br />\nit done, and it stems from the<br />\nhead coach on down. We didn't<br />\ndo a good job in preparing for<br />\nthem.\"<br />\nThe overriding problem in last<br />\nSaturday's game was sacks. The<br />\nBlue Jays were sacked an<br />\nunbelievable sixteen times.<br />\nNeedless to say any potential<br />\ndrive was stymied by Hopkins'<br />\ninability to protect the<br />\nquaterback.<br />\n\"There were some match-ups<br />\nthat turned into mis-matches,\"<br />\nsaid Margraff. \"We didn't make<br />\nany mental efforts, they just outmuscled us. Also, there were<br />\ntimes our quaterbacks were<br />\nholding the ball too long.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays offense began<br />\nthe day with Scott Cade calling<br />\nthe signals, but problems soon<br />\narose. Cade was not sharp, as he<br />\nthrew 2-7 for 9 yards and two interceptions. On one specific<br />\nseries from their own 47 yard<br />\nline, Cade tried to hand off and<br />\nfumbled for a loss of nine, threw<br />\nan incomplete pass and then was<br />\nGeorgetown<br />\nintercepted.<br />\ncapitalized four plays later by<br />\nkicking a 28 yard field goal for<br />\na 3-0 lead. The freshman's<br />\ntroubles continued when he was<br />\npicked off on the following<br />\nseries. Cade's poor performance<br />\nresulted in his replacement with<br />\nJohn Guglielmo.<br />\n\"Scott didn't get off to a great<br />\nstart, and didn't look that great in<br />\nwarm-ups,\" said Margraff.\"He<br />\nwas having an off-day and John<br />\nhad been waiting in the wings for<br />\na while, and having a couple of<br />\ngood weeks of practice.\"<br />\nAt the beginning of the second<br />\nquater, Georgetown increased its<br />\nlead. Helped by a defensive<br />\nholding penalty, the Hoyas drove<br />\nthe ball down to Hopkins' 19 yard<br />\nline. Georgetown's running back<br />\nCesare did the rest as he ran it for<br />\nthe touchdown. The extra point<br />\ngave the Hoyas a 10-0 lead.<br />\nThe Blue Jays offense did improve in the second quarter.<br />\nThanks to strong running from<br />\nMont and Paul Ferreri, the Jays<br />\nwent a number of long drives.<br />\nUnfortunately, sacks kept the<br />\nJays away from any scoring opportunities. The Jays were unable<br />\nto get inside Georgetown's 20<br />\nyard line throughout the football<br />\n<br />\ngame.<br />\n\"That's what really hurt us,\"<br />\nsaid Margraff. \"We'd move the<br />\nball down to inside their thirty,<br />\nand then there would be two<br />\nsacks and we'd face a third and<br />\n30. We should have used our<br />\ntailbacks coming out of the<br />\nbackfield more. What's funny is<br />\ndespite all that crap, we had a<br />\nchance to win late in the game.\"<br />\nWith the half winding down,<br />\nthe Blue Jays went into their<br />\npatented two-minute offense and<br />\nscored for the sixth time this<br />\nseason out of that set. Starting<br />\nform their own 37 yard line the<br />\nBlue Jays drove down to<br />\nGeorgetown's 17 yard line. A<br />\nsack and an incomplete pass<br />\ncreated a 4 and 15 from the<br />\nHoya's 22 yard line with nineteen<br />\nseconds left in the half.

The annual event pits the current varsity squad against past Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse players. The game is an<br />\nopportunity for current players to<br />\nmeet some of the greats that contributed to the rich Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse tradition, the former<br />\nplayers to meet the future of<br />\nHopkins lacrosse and many campus freshmen to get their first<br />\ntaste of the unofficial state sport.<br />\nThis year the event was dedicated<br />\nto the memories of Henry A. Ciccarone, Sr. ('62) and Fred B.<br />\nSmith, Jr. ('50).<br />\nThe alumni squad featured four<br />\ncurrent U.S. National Team<br />\nmembrs, one alternate, current<br />\nindoor league players and a cast<br />\nof former All-Americnas including six alumni from the sixties. In a break from the past,<br />\nJohn Krumenacker ('85) coached the alumni team rather than the<br />\ncurrent varsity coach. To add<br />\nsome humor to the evenings<br />\nfestivities, Dr. Roger Blumenthal<br />\n('81) worked as public address<br />\nannouncer.<br />\nConsidering the quality of the<br />\nalumni team, the varsity squad is<br />\nlucky that the alumni did not have<br />\nthe opportunity to practice<br />\ntogether. As should be expected,<br />\nthe varsity team won going away,<br />\n12-5. However, the score was insignificant to most concerned.<br />\nAccording to game organizer,<br />\nPatrick Russell ('89), the game<br />\nwas intended for, and played, as<br />\nfun for all.<br />\nFreshman attaclunan Brian Piccola opened the scoring fifteen<br />\nseconds into the game. From the<br />\nright side Piccola unleashed a<br />\nbullet and beat world team goalie<br />\nLarry Quinn ('85). The alumni<br />\nlooked like they might actually be<br />\ncompetitive as assistant coach Joe<br />\nCowan ('69) scored on a spectacular behind-the-head shot 4a<br />\nminute later. The varsity team<br />\nproceeded to increase their lead<br />\nwith seven consecutive goals until<br />\nJeff Ihm ('89) scored late in the<br />\n<br />\nfirst half, making it R-2. Senior<br />\nMark Dressel and sophomore<br />\nBrian Tobin added two more<br />\ngoals just seventeen seconds apart<br />\nto give the varsity a 10-2 halftime<br />\nlead.<br />\nOnce the score had gotten out<br />\nof hand, Blumenthal took it upon<br />\nhimself to entertain the crowd.<br />\nWhen the Offitt brothers took<br />\npositions at midfield on a second<br />\nhalf faceoff, Blumenthal pointed<br />\nout \"another brother pair of midfielders not to be confused with<br />\nthe Gaits.\" A look down the<br />\nalumni roster revealed three pairs<br />\nof brothers playing together (Offitt, Ciccarone, Wilkens), two<br />\nplaying against brothers currently on the team (Dressel, Kelly)<br />\nand a father-son combination (Attackman Mike and honorary<br />\nCoach Bill Morrill).<br />\nIn perhaps the most intriguing<br />\nand long awaited matchup, assistant coach Dennis Townsend<br />\n('67) defended against his son,<br />\nsophomore David. This was not<br />\nthe only surprise as All-World<br />\ndefenseman Dave Pietramala forsook his long pole for an attack<br />\nstick while former crease attackman Jay Clarke took up a<br />\nposition at crease defense. While<br />\nClarke managed a couple of stick<br />\nchecks, Petro was less successful.<br />\nPietramala, who said he was tuning up for the upcoming indoor<br />\nseason, was stripped twice by<br />\nfreshman defender Carmen<br />\nCavolo.<br />\nThe game provided head coach<br />\nTony Seaman with another opportunity to view his new system<br />\nat work. The team seems to adjust with each passing day.<br />\nAlthough not playing against a<br />\n\"team,\" the Blue Jays appeared<br />\nmore confident at both ends of the<br />\nfield. Defensively, the squad<br />\nlooked more comfortable with the<br />\nvariations of a zone employed by<br />\nSeaman. Offensively Hopkins<br />\nlooked like a different team from<br />\nthe one that played Towson in the<br />\nCHOICE Visa Lacrosse Classic.<br />\nThe varsity players were passing<br />\nthe way one would expect AllAmericans to pass, scooping<br />\nloose balls and scoring fifteen<br />\n<br />\nPolo Improves<br />\nMark Against<br />\nMAC Foes<br />\n<br />\ngoals on three goalies (including<br />\nthe national team goalie, Quinn,<br />\nand his alternate, Kessenich).<br />\nIf one were to ask, Seaman<br />\nwould surely remark that this was<br />\njust another opportunity for his<br />\nplayers to play against a different<br />\ncolor jersey, not to mention heal<br />\nthe injured, and evaluate the<br />\nyounger players before the spring<br />\ncomes around and the scores start<br />\nto count.<br />\nOn the injury front, senior tricaptain Brian Voelker was<br />\nknocked out in the first half after<br />\nbeing whacked in the nether<br />\nregions but is expected to live. In<br />\na more serious note, senior midfielder John Sheehan was on the<br />\nsidelines after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair both<br />\ncartilage and ligament damage.<br />\nUnfortunately for the Jays,<br />\nSheehan's lacrosse career is now<br />\nover.

This past weekend,<br />\nonly Hopkins and Kings competed head-to-heat but our<br />\nscores will be compared with<br />\nClarkson, St. Johns, and West<br />\nPoint. The results will be faxed<br />\nlater this week, but the scores for<br />\nthe Hopkins team were: Air<br />\nrifle\u2014senior Matt Fisher 279;<br />\nsophomore Andy Bernstein 317;<br />\nsophomore Raphael Yook 175;<br />\nfreshman Evan Bynum 263;<br />\nfreshman Brad Plecs 278. For<br />\nsmallbore, only a half-course was<br />\nfired (two targets in each position, highest possible score of<br />\n600). The results were: Matt<br />\nFisher 494; Andy Bernstein 480;<br />\nRaphael Yook 289; Evan Bynum<br />\n359; Brad Plecs 401. Absent<br />\nfrom the match was sophomore<br />\nChris Hickey.<br />\nCaptain Andy Bernstein commented, \"The scores are where<br />\nwe want to be right now.

Then they didn't do it again,<br />\nso I didn't have any other opportunities,\" Fitzgerald explained.<br />\nSilliman cited junior Jay Smith<br />\nas the Jays' top performer in the<br />\ntournament. He was also quick to<br />\npoint out that his team will have<br />\nother opportunities to beat<br />\nGeorge Washington.<br />\n\"We play the same tournament<br />\nin two weeks, and if we play GW<br />\nthe same way we played them this<br />\nweekend, we'll win.\"<br />\nNext weekend, the team will be<br />\ncompeting in the Washington and<br />\nLee Fall Classic, a nonconference tournament.

Yes, the public is<br />\npaying much higher prices for gas<br />\nnow than it did in July.<br />\nYet despite the oil companies'<br />\ndrop in profits during the crisis,<br />\nAmericans still enjoy some of the<br />\nlowest prices in the world for gas.<br />\nWhile Americans suffer through<br />\nhaving to pay around $1.50 a<br />\ngallon, prices of at least $2, and<br />\nin some places $3 a gallon are<br />\ncommonplace. We still have a<br />\npretty good bargain in this regard.<br />\nBut we wouldn't be so<br />\nvulnerable to foreign influences<br />\nupon our energy prices if we<br />\ncould become more selfsufficient, right? Well, yes, in<br />\nthis point I actually do agree with<br />\n<br />\nthose in opposition to U.S.<br />\npolicy. We could develop the additional, massive oil fields in<br />\nAlaska so we wouldn't have to<br />\nimport as much oil. We could<br />\nalso resume increasing our<br />\nnuclear power resources so that<br />\nwe could have a cleaner alternative source of energy for the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nBut wait\u2014these ideas certainly aren't acceptable to these protestors. The first would cause a<br />\nfew caribou to be relocated a few<br />\nmiles away in the icy wilderness<br />\nof northwest Alaska. We certain-<br />\n<br />\nly can't boost our economy at the<br />\ncost of inconveniencing a few<br />\ncaribou. As for the second, the<br />\nidea of depositing wasteful<br />\nmaterial far underground in<br />\nisolated regions of the country in<br />\norder to produce cheap, nonpolluting energy is just too<br />\ndangerous to comprehend.<br />\nThose who don't believe that<br />\nwe should be over in Saudi<br />\nArabia to protect a vital source of<br />\nenergy for this country must<br />\nrealize that they can't have it both<br />\nways. If they don't feel that we<br />\nshould be over there, then they<br />\n<br />\nshould come up with ways to run<br />\nthis country without this oil and<br />\nalso without using the suggestions<br />\nlisted above (which they probably<br />\nfind impossible to consider).<br />\nMerely criticizing the lifestyles of<br />\n250 million Americans won't<br />\nsolve the problem.<br />\nIn the meantime, apparently<br />\nwith nothing better to do, these<br />\nleft-wing pacifist kooks will continue to rant against this blatant<br />\nexample of U.S. imperialism.<br />\nJust keep checking the letters section of the City Paper; the Great<br />\nConspiracy is certain to return.<br />\n<br />\nMiranda<br />\nContinued from page 4<br />\n\"Never.

In the second half,<br />\nUMBC scored again to extend<br />\ntheir lead to 12-0. Much of the<br />\nsecond half was spent near<br />\nUMBC's try line as Hopkins tried<br />\nto overcome not only the 12 point<br />\ndeficit but also UMBC's dirty<br />\ntactics and blatant punches. Unfortunately, they could only come<br />\naway with 4 points on a try scored<br />\nby senior wing Joe McCullough.<br />\nMcCullough, battling a stomach<br />\nvirus, took his thin, 120-pound<br />\nframe and weaved'and bulled his<br />\nway into the try zone from 20<br />\nyards out.

One<br />\nbright spot in the A game was the<br />\nemergence of freshman second<br />\nrow Bill Conig as an offensive<br />\n<br />\npower. He carried the ball 19<br />\ntimes for 211 yards, most of it in<br />\nthe second half. His comments<br />\nafter the game caused teammates<br />\nto worry, though.

Name me anyone who cares<br />\nas much as your loyal QM.<br />\nBut first a matter of policy. I received a letter this week (mail! I get mail!) from Adrianne<br />\nPierce and Dana Marinacci, two of my entrants from last week, who were concerned about<br />\nlast week's quiz- results being unfair. To recap, I gave the quiz to one of three tied entrants<br />\n(all three of whom had perfect scores after I eliminated my mistake) based on the fact that<br />\nhe had most fully explained my mistake. In doing this, I was not attempting to slight any of<br />\nthe other entrants, I was just trying to find some impartial way to pick one of three equal entries. In the future, in the case of a tie, the winner will be decided by random drawing.(No,<br />\nthat doesn't mean the person whose drawing looks the most random will win.) Also, any entry<br />\ndiscussing Cop Rock will be summarily ignored. Never let it be said that I don't respond well<br />\nto criticism. And Adrianne and Dana. . .1 had nothing to do with those twelve anchovy pizzas<br />\nthat came by your house Thursday.<br />\n1. When was Eva Peron born?<br />\n2. What was her full maiden name?<br />\n3. How many siblings did she have, and what were they named?<br />\n4. Who was Augustin Magaldi?<br />\n5. When did Eva arrive in Buenos Aires, and what town did she leave behind?<br />\n6. What was Eva's ambition when arriving in Buenos Aires?<br />\n7. Where did she get her first big vocational break?<br />\n8. What occurred on June 4, 1943, and how did it affect Eva?<br />\n9. What event brought her to meet Juan Peron?<br />\n10. What did Eva do to assist Juan Peron's rise to power?<br />\n11. How did Eva feel about the middle class of Argentina?<br />\n12. What was Eva's tour of Europe named'?<br />\n13. Where did it stop?<br />\n14. What country refused to invite her?<br />\n15. What Argentinian Society broke tradition and did not ask Eva to be president?<br />\n16. What organization did Eva form as a result of this?<br />\n17. What position did Eva wish to run for in 1951?<br />\n18. What prevented her from doing this?<br />\n19. What was October 17th?<br />\n20. When did Eva die, and what was the suspected cause?<br />\n21. Who is Maria Maggi?<br />\n22. Where did Eva travel to in 1971?<br />\n23. What was remarkable about this trip?<br />\n24. What color was Eva's hair'?<br />\n25. Where does the quiz title come from, and who wrote it?<br />\nBonus: Nobody around here could remember what kind of money they use in Argentina.<br />\nSomebody want to help?<br />\nResults: Well, it wasn't the landslide of last week's Myth quiz, but there were a respectable<br />\namount of people who were busybodies enough to answer it. (Certainly a lot more than there<br />\nwill be for this week's quiz, I'm sure. A big hint: Enter, because you just might win by default.)<br />\nThankfully, I was not forced to deal with the hell that is a tie, so the undisputed champions<br />\nof the 'Bizarre Love Triangles' Quiz (and I was saddened that nobody appreciated that title)<br />\nare Annie \"Don't Call Me Amy\" Flexner and Trey \"Don't Call Me Amy Either\" Trimble,<br />\nwho correctly answered every single question. Many kudos to them. What the hell, they're<br />\nfree. I especially appreciated that for the bonus question they paired me up with Johnny Depp<br />\nand Winona Ryder, may they have a short and unhappy marriage.

The article concerned the<br />\nGarfinckel's Department Store<br />\npolicy, stating that black women<br />\nwere not allowed to try on merchandise because white women<br />\nwould not want to buy the same<br />\nitems tried on by blacks. \"This<br />\nwas a staple reality of 1965,\"<br />\nWilliams said.<br />\nRecounting this history,<br />\nWilliams suggested that society is<br />\nnot divorced from the past, but<br />\nrather that the society is still in<br />\nneed of change. \"We are the<br />\nhistory makers,\" Williams said,<br />\n\"We need to take up that<br />\nchallenge and put ourselves on<br />\nthe line.\"<br />\nStudents shaped much of the<br />\nhistory of the civil rights movement, according to Williams, and<br />\nhave the potential to continue this<br />\ninvolvement. Barbara Jones, a 16<br />\nyear old from Prince Edward<br />\nCounty, Williams noted, brought<br />\nher segregated school and community to the attention of the<br />\nNAACP's chief legal counsel<br />\nThurgood Marshall, even after<br />\nmembers of the NAACP Legal<br />\nDefense Fund denied her request<br />\nfor help. Her initial efforts,<br />\nWilliams noted, resulted in one<br /><br />\nof the five cases on which Brown<br />\nvs. the Board of Education was<br />\nbased.<br />\nThese incidents were not the<br />\nexception, Williams argued,<br />\nbecause there is evidence that<br />\nthey \"happened throughout the<br />\nmovement.\" Young people continue to be involved, Williams<br />\nadded, in cases of racial tension<br />\nlike Bensonhurst where a black<br />\nteenager was killed by a young<br />\nwhite male on August 23, 1989.<br />\nWilliams pointed to the \"really sad reality\" which the country now faces. White students<br />\ncomplain<br />\nabout<br />\nreverse<br />\ndiscrimination in school admittance, political reporters claim<br />\nthat blacks vote for black politicians solely because of their skin<br />\ncolor, and white residents of<br />\npoor, inner-city neighborhoods<br />\nare afraid because of the increase<br />\nin crime by black people.<br />\nSchool admissions officers,<br />\nWilliams argued, consider race<br />\njust as they would athletic talent,<br />\nfamily connections or geographic<br />\nlocation. \"If you want to be a true<br />\nleader in society,\" Williams said,<br />\n\"[You have to) go to a school<br />\nwhere there's some diversity.\"<br />\nIn responding to the political<br />\nreporter's claim, Williams agreed<br />\nthat blacks act on racial basis in<br />\npolitical elections. He said that<br />\nthis could be expected, however,<br />\nbecause blacks were prevented<br />\nfrom holding office in the past.<br />\nHe attributed the political<br />\ndevelopment to a \"historical<br />\nphase of black pride\" which he<br />\nhoped would \"not denegrate inContinued on page 2<br /><br />\nNew Cognitive Science Major<br />\nOffers Study of Mental Processes<br />\nby Laura Perkinson<br />\nA cognitive science major has<br />\nbeen made available to Hopkins<br />\nstudents this semester for the first<br />\ntime. This innovative study,<br />\nwhich has been expanding rapidly<br />\nthroughout the country in recent<br />\nyears, has been at Hopkins in the<br />\nform of a Cognitive Science<br />\ncenter for three years, but an official major in the area was approved just last spring. Programs<br />\nof study have been introduced on<br />\nboth the graduate and<br />\nundergraduate levels.<br />\nThe response to the new major<br /><br />\nhas been very encouraging, says<br />\nDr. Carramazza, head of the<br />\ndepartment. Without any publicity or advertisement of the program, five undergraduates have<br />\nalready declared majors in the<br />\nfield. Carramazza feels that the<br />\nnew major will be popular among<br />\nstudents because the field offers<br />\n\"new challenges and new ideas\"<br />\nand can be approached from a<br />\nvariety of different angles.<br />\nCognitive science is a study of<br />\nthe mind and its processes: it involves a composite of many different areas of science, including<br />\npsychology, computer science,<br /><br />\nThis Week<br />\nCome on.

Students who major in cognitive science are required to take introductory<br />\ncourses in all these areas while<br />\nfocusing on two subjects of<br />\ninterest.<br />\nThis exposure to a broad range<br />\nof studies is expected to offer the<br />\nadvantage of allowing students to<br />\nexplore questions of the mind and<br />\nhow it works from different viewpoints. As Dr. Carramazza explains, students will need \"basic<br />\nskills in different disciplines in<br />\norder to tackle problems of the<br />\nmind, brain, and perception.\"<br />\nPresently, there are four faculty<br />\nmembers in the department, and<br />\nCarramazza is actually searching<br />\nfor a fifth professor; preferably,<br />\none with expertise in the area of<br />\ncomputational modeling, which<br />\nentails designing computer<br />\nmodels of the human brain.

It is also a name<br />\nassociated with philosophical<br />\nthinking and education. But, what<br />\nis education, what is it that we<br />\nlearn in life?\"<br />\nCousins said that the main pur-<br /><br />\npose of education was to help an<br />\nindividual come into \"full possession of his/her powers.\" Cousins<br />\nalso elaborated on his visit to the<br />\nU.S.S.R. and the metamorphosis<br />\nof the Soviet Union. He said that<br />\nthere is danger in the change itself<br />\nbecause political change does not<br />\nequate economic change. There<br />\nare long lines in front of the foodbank and deep dissatisfaction<br />\namong the citizens and it is uncertain whether economic change<br />\nwill catch up, he explained.<br />\nCousins advocates outside intervention. He says that the U.S.<br />\nshould encourage American<br />\nbusiness to open factories in the<br />\nU.S.S.R. instead of giving aid<br />\ndirectly so a free-market<br />\neconomy can be set up. Other-<br /><br />\nwise, the Soviet Union, in its<br />\ndesperate search for hard currency, may be forced to sell stocks<br />\nof weapons to the third world<br />\ncountries, \"which would only<br />\ncreate other Iraqs and trans.\"<br />\nThe cold war is ending but its<br />\nlegacy continues, according to<br />\nCousins. He cited two aspects of<br />\nthe legacy that persist: weapons<br />\nand secrecy. Cousins said that<br />\nsecrecy is a habit that can destroy<br />\nour institutions. For example, the<br />\ngovernment's claim is that only<br />\n250 troops were killed in Panama<br />\nwhile only two weeks ago,<br />\nCousins said, \"60 Minutes\"<br />\nreported that there were more<br />\nthan 4,000 casualties and that the<br />\nbodies were buried secretly.<br />\nContinued on page 2<br /><br />\n2/OCTOBER 26, 1990<br /><br />\nStudent Council Votes to Form<br />\nCommittee to Investigate ROTC<br />\ntheir sexual preference and,<br />\naccording to DelGrosso, highly<br />\nprejudiced.

Particularly<br />\npressing for students, and troubling for administrators, is<br />\nHopkins' earned reputation as a relentlessly academic school,<br />\nwithout time or space for socializing among students. Last Saturday night the Grad Club hosted its first big dance party of the<br />\nyear. Two live bands played to a large, enthusiastic student<br />\ncrowd\u2014an outbreak of that elusive social life and, for that evening, at least, a student gathering place. The bands played from<br />\n10:00 p.m. until approximately 1:15 a.m. The evening was successful from a financial standpoint as well as a programming/organizational standpoint.<br />\nApparently, however, some McCoy residents found the noise<br />\nfrom this successful event objectionable. Noise in McCoy has<br />\nalways been an obstacle for the club and an issue of negotiation between the club, the residents, and Residential Life. Last<br />\nyear these negotiations led to the cancellation of Thursday night<br />\nFunk Nite, volume limits, the addition of sound absorption<br />\npanels, and other programming modifications.<br />\nThis week negotiations were by-passed, and a decree was<br />\nhanded down: no amplified music, probably for the rest of the<br />\nyear. The new club management was not given an opportunity<br />\nto meet with McCoy residents or to investigate the noise situation themselves. It is not clear how many residents complained. When the club received the first complaint at 10:15 p.m.,<br />\nthe manager turned down the volume and closed the doors and<br />\nwindows. No further complaints were received directly by the<br />\nclub, leading the manager to believe that these steps had offered at least some relief.<br />\nCertainly the needs of McCoy residents need to be addressed. The current management of the Grad Club wants very much<br /><br />\nto \"meet them halfway.\" The Grad Club is operating from an<br />\nalready greatly compromised position, given the concessions<br />\nmade last year, but the managers are willing to bend further<br />\nin order to accommodate those with complaints. But the decision was made before any such dialogue could take place.<br />\nThe Grad Club exists for students and is operated primarily<br />\nby students. It fills many gaps in Hopkins life\u2014gaps left by<br />\na lack of on-campus housing and a poor substitute for a student union. This year, with new hours and the addition of coffee to the menu, a broader slice of the student population has<br />\ntaken advantage of the space and atmosphere. Students meet<br />\nfor a cozy chat, a cup of coffee, or a break from the fluorescent glare of the library. Student groups schedule meetings<br />\nthere, avoiding the battle for on-campus space and offering their<br />\nmembers a more casual but still productive atmosphere, with<br />\npossibilities for socializing after the meeting.<br />\nDuring the week the club does not sell enough beer, coffee,<br />\nor pizza to pay the wages of the student staff. While this does<br />\nnot mean that the overall benefits to students do not justify the<br />\ninvestment, it makes for a weaker case when confronting a(supposedly) financially strapped administration. However, revenues<br />\nfrom last Saturday indicate that the club could operate in the<br />\nblack with five quiet nights and one music night each week.<br />\nThis schedule represents sensitivity to the needs of both the \"student population at large\" and McCoy residents. Students have<br />\nboth meeting and social space during the week, and an alternative to fraternity parties and the local bars on the weekend.<br />\nAll of this can be maintained with only three hours of amplified<br />\nmusic each week. If three hours of music each week, on a<br />\nweekend night, with the music off by 1:00 a.m., and the volume<br />\nkept below a certain level is not considered a generous compromise, what would be?<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nA Victim Asks: Wherefore Security?

Once<br />\nMicaela leaves (this time for her<br />\nfar away home), Carmen is involved in a fight at the cigarette<br />\nfactory. Don Jose, under orders<br />\nfrom his superior officer, must<br />\narrest Carmen. While he is<br />\nholding Carmen, she sings to him<br /><br />\nand completes her seduction.<br />\nRather than go to jail, Don Jose<br />\nallows Carmen to escape; for<br />\nthis, Jose must go to jail for one<br />\nmonth.<br />\nCarmen returns to her life of<br />\npartying. During Jose's imprisonment, she attracts the attention of<br />\na famous matador, Escamillo,<br />\nwho sings of his exploits at the<br /><br />\nbullfight with the famous aria,<br />\n\"Votre toast,\" more commonly<br />\nknown as the theme to the Bad<br />\nNews Bears. Carmen, however,<br />\nremains loyal to Don Jose. Jose<br />\nreturns to Carmen at the inn that<br />\nnight, but one of Jose's officers<br />\nstops by the inn and he and Jose<br />\nget into a fight. Jose, now an<br />\noutlaw, joins Carmen in the<br /><br />\nmountains.<br />\nbecomes<br />\nquickly<br />\nJose<br />\nhomesick, and Carmen, known<br />\nfor her fickleness, grows increasingly bored with Jose. Their<br />\nfights become more frequent and<br />\nvolatile. Carmen amuses herself<br />\nby asking the fortune-teller about<br />\nher future loves, but the cards<br />\nforetell death for Carmen and her<br /><br />\nlover. One day Escamillo visits<br />\nthe group in the mountains and<br />\ninvites everyone to the next<br />\nbullfight, leading to another fight<br />\nbetween Carmen and Jose.<br />\nMicaela then arrives in the mountains to tell Jose that his mother<br />\nis dying; _lose returns to his<br />\nvillage with Micaela, leaving<br />\nCarmen behind with the promise<br /><br />\nthat he will return. The final<br />\nscene of the opera occurs outside<br />\nthe bullfight arena in Seville.<br />\nCarmen has fallen in love with<br />\nEscamillo, and she attends the!<br />\nfight with him. Once everyone!<br />\nbut Carmen is inside, Don Jose<br />\nappears to have one last word<br />\nwith Carmen. he has been waiting<br />\nfor her to ask her to come away<br />\nwith him; he wants a new start<br />\nwith her. Carmen replies that she<br />\nand Jose are finished, and then<br />\nshe tosses his ring at him. When<br />\nCarmen then tries to run past Don<br />\nJose into the arena, Jose stabs her<br />\nand then falls down in despair<br />\nbeside her dead body.<br />\nThe performances overall were<br />\ngood, with one noticeable exception. Isola Jones as Carmen was<br />\nvery disappointing. To say that<br />\nshe gave a bad performance is<br />\nputting it mildly. Her only talent<br />\nseemed to be to stand with both<br />\nfeet a foot apart, stare at the audience, and sing poorly. Before<br />\nshe opened her mouth each time,<br />\nshe would prepare this stance<br />\ntowards the audience; she did not<br />\nact at all. Excellent singing could<br />\nhave saved this Carmen, but she<br />\nlacked that also; she completely<br />\ndestroyed her most famous aria.<br />\nShe seemed unable to cover the<br />\nfull range that the part demanded, often dropping her voice<br />\nsharply rather than smoothly. As<br />\na seductive Carmen, she was<br />\nbland or whorish. Many of the<br />\nother cigarette girls were more<br />\nalluring.<br />\nThe character of Micaela,<br />\nplayed by Carmen Balthrop, was<br />\na remarkable contrast to Carmen.<br />\nMicaela literally stole the show,<br />\nreceiving the most applause. She<br />\nwas supurb in every way. Her<br />\nsinging was rich and full of the<br />\nsoul of the Micaela character.<br />\nHer acting ability matched her<br />\nsinging ability.

This<br />\nhistorical fiction deals with the<br />\nstruggle between performers and<br />\nproducers, as well as the role the<br />\nsubjugated should should take<br />\nagainst oppressors and exploiters.<br />\nA great set and strong performances from Thomas Martell<br />\nBrimm, Clabert Ford, and Ebony<br />\nJo-Ann (recreating the title role<br />\nfrom her Broadway run) and<br />\nothers make this an enjoyable<br />\nevening at Center Stage (700 N.<br />\nCalvert St., 332-0033). Half-<br /><br />\nBaltimore Opera's Mediocre<br />\nReading Of Bizet's Carmen<br />\nContinued from page 8<br />\nfluid and full of emotion than<br />\nCarmen, and more believable,<br />\nalthough her songs were not the<br />\nmost exciting of the show. The<br />\ncharacters of Don Jose, played by<br />\nJohn Absalom, and Escamillo,<br />\nplayed by Craig Heath Nim were<br />\nportrayed unspectacularly well,<br />\nwith nothing exciting about them.<br />\nBoth men sang and acted adequately, with the only real fault<br />\nbeing that Nim could have projected his voice better, especially during \"Votre toast\", a song<br />\nthat calls for volume.<br />\nThe real talent came from a<br />\nusually unappreciated source: the<br />\norchestra. Enrique Batiz's con-<br /><br />\nducting was brilliant as he produced a powerful and entertaining interpretation to an opera that<br />\nhas often been butchered. I have<br />\nheard many versions of Carmen,<br />\nand Batiz has given one of the<br />\nbest orchestral performances.<br />\nBecause the score is so widely<br />\nrecognised and important to<br />\nCarmen, the orchestra made an<br />\notherwise mediocre performance<br />\nby the cast worthwhile. Credit is<br />\nalso due to the lighting and set<br />\ndesigners.Lighting was very effective in paralleling the mood of<br />\nthe story; the slowly brightening<br />\nred light during the final scene<br />\nmatching the building desperation<br />\nand rage of Jose which finally<br /><br />\nprice tickets ($4-$14) available to<br />\nstudents on the day of performance.

Your arms<br />\nare full of packages\u2014you've been<br />\ndoing some holiday shopping.<br />\nYou notice a van parked next to<br />\nyour car on the driver's side. It's<br />\ngetting dark and your car is in a<br />\nrather remote corner of the parking lot. How do you feel? What<br />\ndo you do?<br />\nThis question of emotional<br />\nresponse and judgment opened<br />\nthe Brown Bag Lunch Series'<br />\nprogram on sexual assault protection. Sharon Reynolds, representative from the Sexual Assault<br />\nRecovery Center and perhaps better known on campus as the<br />\nAssistant Director of Residential<br />\nLife led the program, offering<br />\nvaluable tips on self-defense and<br />\nprotection from sexual assault.<br />\nIn the parking lot scenario,<br />\nSharon suggested consolidating<br />\npackages to allow for a free hand,<br />\nholding a key before getting to the<br />\ncar, and even entering through<br />\nthe passenger's door and climbing through to the driver's side.<br />\n\"You may feel a little silly,\"<br />\nshe acknowledged, \"but it may<br />\njust make the difference and mean<br />\nyour safety.\"<br />\nMs. Reynolds emphasized the<br />\nimportance of remaining aware of<br />\none's surroundings at all times.<br />\nShe drew an analogy to<br />\nautomobile safety. \"When you're<br />\ndriving a car, you're constantly<br />\nkeeping track of who's around<br />\nyou,\" she said.<br />\nShe continued to explain that it<br />\nis important to trust your intuitive<br />\nreaction to potentially dangerous<br />\nsituations. If possible, she suggests finding the closest well-lit<br />\nand populated area to discourage<br />\nattackers.<br />\nEqually important in selfdefense strategy is not allowing<br />\noneself to look like an easy target.<br />\n\"Look like you're in charge,\"<br />\nshe says. \"The less vulnerable<br /><br />\nyou look, the less likely you are<br />\nto be a victim.\"<br />\nIn addition to looking confident, Ms. Reynolds suggested<br />\nthat women wear flats instead of<br />\nheels, and always keep one hand<br />\nfree for defense. She cautioned<br />\nwomen on carrying self-defense<br />\napparatus such as mace and handguns, however because they can<br />\neasily be used against the victim.<br />\nInstead, she recommended selfdefense classes, which teach not<br />\nonly strategy for physically warding off attackers, but just as importantly how to stay calm in<br />\norder to be able to defend oneself<br />\nmore effectively.<br />\nMs. Reynolds also suggested<br />\npracticing drawing attention to<br />\nthe attack. She explained that<br />\noften women are mentally unprepared for an attack and find<br />\nthemselves unable to scream or<br />\nrun. Practicing screaming and<br />\nplanning methods of alerting attention can be vital to selfpreservation.<br />\nMs. Reynolds also acknowledged that in certain circumstances one can only hope to<br />\ntalk an attacker out of attacking.<br />\n\"Sometimes you're in a lifethreatening situation,\" she says.<br />\n\"The reality is it's better to be<br />\nalive. Sometimes you can't fight<br />\nback.\"<br />\nDuring the second half of the<br />\nprogram Ms. Reynolds opened<br />\nthe floor to discussion. Members<br />\nof the audience offered stories<br />\nand safety tips. As one woman<br />\nnoted, \"You shouldn't be deceived by the appearance of someone. Chances are he won't<br />\nlook like a rapist.\"<br />\nA free Women's Self Protection Workshop will be held on<br />\nTuesday, November 6 and Thursday November 8 in the AMR I<br />\nMulti-Purpose Room. The session will be led by Sharon Sirkis,<br />\nowner and instructor at Universal Kempo Karate. All interested<br />\nwomen students, staff and faculty are invited to attend.<br /><br />\nter of personality causing the<br />\ndisease, but rather the disease<br />\ncausing the personality.\"<br />\nIn a similar story, Prodey told<br />\nof a researcher who hypothesized that students who were impatient and arrogant and who had illegible penmanship were more<br />\nlikely to become doctors. The<br />\nresearcher found that these<br />\ncharacteristics, which she termed \"Physician's Personality<br />\nDisorder,\" were the result of the<br />\nprofession, not the cause. Normal<br />\npeople simply underwent a personality change.\u2022<br />\nSimilarly, most alcoholics are<br />\notherwise normal people, though<br />\nsome alcohol abusers do have<br />\ncharacter disorders or psychiatric<br />\ndisorders. Others, particularly<br />\nthose with an alcoholic parent,<br />\nmay have a genetic predisposition<br />\nto the disease.<br />\nBut even those predisposed or<br />\nat risk for alcoholism are not<br />\nnecessarily predestined to abuse<br />\nalcohol. As Prodey explained,<br />\n\"If you don't learn denial, you<br />\ncan't become a drunk.\" A loss of<br />\ncontrol begins the process of<br />\nalcohol abuse. Occasional drinks<br />\nbecome repeated drinks, repeated<br />\ndrinks become a habit, and the<br />\nhabit becomes an addiction.<br />\nAs Martin emphasized, the best<br />\nways to prevent the occasional<br />\nsocial drink from developing into a pattern of abuse are education and wellness. \"Alcohol has<br />\na place in our society. . . but if<br />\npeople are going to use alcohol,<br />\nthere are things they need to<br />\nknow.\"<br />\nThe large majority of people do<br />\ndrink responsibly. But \"by<br />\ndefinition, anybody with a problem has a problem, and that<br />\ndoesn't necessarily mean<br />\nalcoholism. It might mean missing classes, drinking and driving,<br />\nfighting with family or with a<br />\nboyfriend or girlfriend. . . these<br /><br />\nBret Akers<br /><br />\nCult of personality<br />\nPersonality will not predict alcohol abuse, says Richard Prodey.<br />\nall signify a problem. \"You don't<br />\nhave to be an alcoholic to have<br />\nproblems.\"<br />\nAccording to Martin, \"alcohol<br />\nabuse does not exist in a<br />\nvacuum.\" Problems with alcohol<br />\nare often just symptomatic of<br />\nunderlying problems with selfesteem. This is why, for example, anorexics and bulimics often<br />\nbecome alcoholic.<br />\nAccording to Martin, \"It fits in<br />\nwith our philosophy that alcohol<br />\nis only one of the wellness<br />\nissues. . . Many other things interact with alcohol. We have tried<br />\nnot to just look at alcohol in isolation.\"<br />\nWellness and education are the<br />\ntwo most effective ways of combatting alcoholism. \"The better<br />\npersonal skills we have, the better we feel about ourselves, the<br />\nless likely we'll harm ourselves.\"<br />\nThis was also the rationale behind<br />\nthe Wellness fair in the Glass<br />\nPavilion on Wednesday.<br />\nThe Wellness fair, while emphasizing responsible alcohol use<br />\nin accordance with National Col-<br /><br />\nlegiate Alcohol Awareness Week,<br />\nalso featured booths for APTT,<br />\nthe Randallstown High chapter of<br />\nSADD,and a variety of substance<br />\nabuse programs.<br />\nThe Faculty and Staff<br />\nAssistance program gave out<br />\ngreen baloons while the Hopkins<br />\nHospital Program for Alcohol<br />\nand Chemical Dependencies offered a sour ball in exchange for<br />\na correct answer about a question<br />\nabut alcohol. Outside, students<br />\ncould test their alcohol<br />\nknowledge on the \"Wheel of Information\" and win a pack of<br />\npumpkin seeds or condoms.<br />\nBut though the fair was designed to increase alcohol awareness<br />\nthrough fun events, Martin tried<br />\nto downplay the significance of<br />\nthis week as a major event. \"We<br />\ndidn't want a glitz and glitter<br />\nthing on just this one week,\" she<br />\ncommented. Hopkins instead emphasizes Wellness throughout the<br />\nyear, as seen, for example, in the<br />\nBrown Bag Lunch series.<br />\nMartin also blamed society for<br />\nmuch of the low self esteem<br /><br />\nwhich can cause alcohol abuse.<br />\nShe believes that society creates<br />\nthe belief that there is a product<br />\nfor every need: to make you feel<br />\ngood, to make you attractive to<br />\nthe opposite sex, to make you<br />\npopular. When people can't obtain<br />\nthe happy ideal promoted by the<br />\nproducts, they become depressed and often turn to alcohol or<br />\nother substances to make them<br />\nfeel better.<br />\nThis societal influence made<br />\nMartin's task that much more difficult. \"My job is to promote<br />\nwellness,\" she said, \"and this fits<br />\ninto a larger scheme of things. It's<br />\nreal difficult to tight something<br />\nthat's so widely entrenched in our<br />\nsociety. We're talking about a<br />\nsocietal issue here.\"<br />\nMartin admits that educating<br />\npeople about responsible alcohol<br />\nuse is an uphill fight, but she<br />\nbelieves that it can\u2014and will\u2014<br />\nbe done. \"I respect people's<br />\ndescision to drink\u2014within the<br />\nlaw. But if they're \u2022 going to<br />\nchoose to drink, these are the<br />\nthings they need to know.\"<br /><br />\nFood for Thought: Chi-Chi's<br />\nby Jessica Maxwell<br />\nThis week's food for thought<br />\nis Chi-Chi's on York and<br />\nTimonium Roads. This one<br />\ndefinitely requires a car.<br />\nHowever, since it is Parent's<br />\nWeekend, this escape from campus might be possible. It is easy<br />\nto get to (you can impress Mom<br />\nand Dad with your navigational<br />\nskills): follow Charles Street to<br />\n695 East to York Road, or take<br />\nYork Road directly, about two<br />\nmiles north to Timonium Road.<br />\nTurn left and Chi-Chi's will be<br />\non your left. They take AmEx,<br /><br />\nSCHOLARSHIPS<br />\nFELLOWSHIPS<br />\nGRANTS<br />\nEDS'S SERVICES<br />\nBOX 3006<br />\nBOSTON, MA 02l30<br /><br />\nVisa, MC, and Discover.<br />\nFor those of you who have<br />\nnever been there before, the first<br />\nthing they do at Chi-Chi's is bring<br />\nyou chips and salsa. So there really isn't any need to order an appetizer. They do have a few,<br />\nthough, most notably the Mexican Pizza. This has recently been<br />\none of their promotions, and it is<br />\nonly $6.95.<br />\nFor entrees, there are many to<br />\nchoose from. My favorite is the<br />\nChajita. It is brought out to you<br />\non its own skillet, so it is always<br />\nsizzling hot. It is served one of<br />\ntwo ways, either Ranch style or<br /><br />\nHacienda style. I recommend the<br />\nRanch. It comes with flour tortillas, lettuce, tomato, sour<br />\ncream, grated cheese and<br />\nguacamole. On the side, there is<br />\nalso Spanish rice. With Chajitas,<br />\nyou have the choice of chicken,<br />\npork, beef, or shrimp, or a combination of any two for the same<br />\nprice ($8.95).<br />\nAfter dinner, there are a few<br />\ndesserts; the fried ice cream is<br />\ngood, but I also like the sopapillas<br />\n($2.25). They come with<br />\nchocolate, honey or strawberry<br />\nsauce. Sopapillas are triangular<br />\npieces of fried dough. So if you<br /><br />\nlike fried dough (or triangles),<br />\nyou'll definitely like these. I also<br />\nrecommend one of Chi-Chi's coffee drinks to go along with<br />\ndessert. And for those of you who<br />\nare not legal, their regular coffee<br />\nis pretty good too.<br />\nChi-Chi's<br />\n23 W.

However, in this week's<br />\nepisode the Jays traveled into the<br />\nnation's capital to battle the<br />\nGeorgetown Hoyas. Thoughts of<br />\nLinda Blair must have danced in<br />\ntheir heads as the Blue Jays lost<br />\nto the Hoyas 17-3. The loss dropped the Hopkins' record to 3-4<br />\noverall.<br />\n\"They're a pretty talented football team,- said Head Coach Jim<br />\nMargraff. \"We needed a big<br />\ngame from both sides of the ball.<br />\nThe defense played a very nice<br />\ngame, but the offense did not get<br />\nit done, and it stems from the<br />\nhead coach on down. We didn't<br />\ndo a good job in preparing for<br />\nthem.\"<br />\nThe overriding problem in last<br />\nSaturday's game was sacks. The<br />\nBlue Jays were sacked an<br />\nunbelievable sixteen times.<br />\nNeedless to say any potential<br />\ndrive was stymied by Hopkins'<br />\ninability to protect the<br />\nquaterback.<br />\n\"There were some match-ups<br />\nthat turned into mis-matches,\"<br />\nsaid Margraff. \"We didn't make<br />\nany mental efforts, they just outmuscled us. Also, there were<br />\ntimes our quaterbacks were<br />\nholding the ball too long.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays offense began<br />\nthe day with Scott Cade calling<br />\nthe signals, but problems soon<br />\narose. Cade was not sharp, as he<br />\nthrew 2-7 for 9 yards and two interceptions. On one specific<br />\nseries from their own 47 yard<br />\nline, Cade tried to hand off and<br />\nfumbled for a loss of nine, threw<br />\nan incomplete pass and then was<br />\nGeorgetown<br />\nintercepted.<br />\ncapitalized four plays later by<br />\nkicking a 28 yard field goal for<br />\na 3-0 lead. The freshman's<br />\ntroubles continued when he was<br />\npicked off on the following<br />\nseries. Cade's poor performance<br />\nresulted in his replacement with<br />\nJohn Guglielmo.<br />\n\"Scott didn't get off to a great<br />\nstart, and didn't look that great in<br />\nwarm-ups,\" said Margraff.\"He<br />\nwas having an off-day and John<br />\nhad been waiting in the wings for<br />\na while, and having a couple of<br />\ngood weeks of practice.\"<br />\nAt the beginning of the second<br />\nquater, Georgetown increased its<br />\nlead. Helped by a defensive<br />\nholding penalty, the Hoyas drove<br />\nthe ball down to Hopkins' 19 yard<br />\nline. Georgetown's running back<br />\nCesare did the rest as he ran it for<br />\nthe touchdown. The extra point<br />\ngave the Hoyas a 10-0 lead.<br />\nThe Blue Jays offense did improve in the second quarter.<br />\nThanks to strong running from<br />\nMont and Paul Ferreri, the Jays<br />\nwent a number of long drives.<br />\nUnfortunately, sacks kept the<br />\nJays away from any scoring opportunities. The Jays were unable<br />\nto get inside Georgetown's 20<br />\nyard line throughout the football<br /><br />\ngame.<br />\n\"That's what really hurt us,\"<br />\nsaid Margraff. \"We'd move the<br />\nball down to inside their thirty,<br />\nand then there would be two<br />\nsacks and we'd face a third and<br />\n30. We should have used our<br />\ntailbacks coming out of the<br />\nbackfield more. What's funny is<br />\ndespite all that crap, we had a<br />\nchance to win late in the game.\"<br />\nWith the half winding down,<br />\nthe Blue Jays went into their<br />\npatented two-minute offense and<br />\nscored for the sixth time this<br />\nseason out of that set. Starting<br />\nform their own 37 yard line the<br />\nBlue Jays drove down to<br />\nGeorgetown's 17 yard line. A<br />\nsack and an incomplete pass<br />\ncreated a 4 and 15 from the<br />\nHoya's 22 yard line with nineteen<br />\nseconds left in the half.

Ciccarone, Sr. ('62) and Fred B.<br />\nSmith, Jr. ('50).<br />\nThe alumni squad featured four<br />\ncurrent U.S. National Team<br />\nmembrs, one alternate, current<br />\nindoor league players and a cast<br />\nof former All-Americnas including six alumni from the sixties. In a break from the past,<br />\nJohn Krumenacker ('85) coached the alumni team rather than the<br />\ncurrent varsity coach. To add<br />\nsome humor to the evenings<br />\nfestivities, Dr. Roger Blumenthal<br />\n('81) worked as public address<br />\nannouncer.<br />\nConsidering the quality of the<br />\nalumni team, the varsity squad is<br />\nlucky that the alumni did not have<br />\nthe opportunity to practice<br />\ntogether. As should be expected,<br />\nthe varsity team won going away,<br />\n12-5. However, the score was insignificant to most concerned.<br />\nAccording to game organizer,<br />\nPatrick Russell ('89), the game<br />\nwas intended for, and played, as<br />\nfun for all.<br />\nFreshman attaclunan Brian Piccola opened the scoring fifteen<br />\nseconds into the game. From the<br />\nright side Piccola unleashed a<br />\nbullet and beat world team goalie<br />\nLarry Quinn ('85). The alumni<br />\nlooked like they might actually be<br />\ncompetitive as assistant coach Joe<br />\nCowan ('69) scored on a spectacular behind-the-head shot 4a<br />\nminute later. The varsity team<br />\nproceeded to increase their lead<br />\nwith seven consecutive goals until<br />\nJeff Ihm ('89) scored late in the<br /><br />\nfirst half, making it R-2. Senior<br />\nMark Dressel and sophomore<br />\nBrian Tobin added two more<br />\ngoals just seventeen seconds apart<br />\nto give the varsity a 10-2 halftime<br />\nlead.<br />\nOnce the score had gotten out<br />\nof hand, Blumenthal took it upon<br />\nhimself to entertain the crowd.<br />\nWhen the Offitt brothers took<br />\npositions at midfield on a second<br />\nhalf faceoff, Blumenthal pointed<br />\nout \"another brother pair of midfielders not to be confused with<br />\nthe Gaits.\" A look down the<br />\nalumni roster revealed three pairs<br />\nof brothers playing together (Offitt, Ciccarone, Wilkens), two<br />\nplaying against brothers currently on the team (Dressel, Kelly)<br />\nand a father-son combination (Attackman Mike and honorary<br />\nCoach Bill Morrill).<br />\nIn perhaps the most intriguing<br />\nand long awaited matchup, assistant coach Dennis Townsend<br />\n('67) defended against his son,<br />\nsophomore David. This was not<br />\nthe only surprise as All-World<br />\ndefenseman Dave Pietramala forsook his long pole for an attack<br />\nstick while former crease attackman Jay Clarke took up a<br />\nposition at crease defense. While<br />\nClarke managed a couple of stick<br />\nchecks, Petro was less successful.<br />\nPietramala, who said he was tuning up for the upcoming indoor<br />\nseason, was stripped twice by<br />\nfreshman defender Carmen<br />\nCavolo.<br />\nThe game provided head coach<br />\nTony Seaman with another opportunity to view his new system<br />\nat work. The team seems to adjust with each passing day.<br />\nAlthough not playing against a<br />\n\"team,\" the Blue Jays appeared<br />\nmore confident at both ends of the<br />\nfield. Defensively, the squad<br />\nlooked more comfortable with the<br />\nvariations of a zone employed by<br />\nSeaman. Offensively Hopkins<br />\nlooked like a different team from<br />\nthe one that played Towson in the<br />\nCHOICE Visa Lacrosse Classic.<br />\nThe varsity players were passing<br />\nthe way one would expect AllAmericans to pass, scooping<br />\nloose balls and scoring fifteen<br /><br />\nPolo Improves<br />\nMark Against<br />\nMAC Foes<br /><br />\ngoals on three goalies (including<br />\nthe national team goalie, Quinn,<br />\nand his alternate, Kessenich).<br />\nIf one were to ask, Seaman<br />\nwould surely remark that this was<br />\njust another opportunity for his<br />\nplayers to play against a different<br />\ncolor jersey, not to mention heal<br />\nthe injured, and evaluate the<br />\nyounger players before the spring<br />\ncomes around and the scores start<br />\nto count.<br />\nOn the injury front, senior tricaptain Brian Voelker was<br />\nknocked out in the first half after<br />\nbeing whacked in the nether<br />\nregions but is expected to live. In<br />\na more serious note, senior midfielder John Sheehan was on the<br />\nsidelines after undergoing arthroscopic surgery to repair both<br />\ncartilage and ligament damage.<br />\nUnfortunately for the Jays,<br />\nSheehan's lacrosse career is now<br />\nover.

Whereas with<br />\nother sports, schools are<br />\nclassified into particular divisions, rifle sports are set up in<br />\nconferences. There are thirtyseven teams in the Mid-Atlantic<br />\nConference, of which Hopkins is<br />\none. Each team must compete<br />\nwith every other team during the<br />\nseason, but instead of shooting<br />\nthirty-six matches in person,<br />\nschools are allowed to send their<br />\nscores to a committee for comparison. As long as different<br />\nschools' scores are fired within a<br />\nweek of each other, they can be<br />\ncompared. This past weekend,<br />\nonly Hopkins and Kings competed head-to-heat but our<br />\nscores will be compared with<br />\nClarkson, St. Johns, and West<br />\nPoint. The results will be faxed<br />\nlater this week, but the scores for<br />\nthe Hopkins team were: Air<br />\nrifle\u2014senior Matt Fisher 279;<br />\nsophomore Andy Bernstein 317;<br />\nsophomore Raphael Yook 175;<br />\nfreshman Evan Bynum 263;<br />\nfreshman Brad Plecs 278.

Nevertheless,<br />\nmost of of the game was in<br />\nUMBC's territory as Hopkins<br />\ncontinually showed flashes of<br />\nbrilliance but was never quite able<br />\nto sustain it into the try zone.<br />\nHopkins was down by 6 points<br />\nearly in the game but was confident that they could pull off<br />\nanother come-from-behind victory (3 of their 4 wins were comefrom-behind). Their onslaught into UMBC territory was led by the<br />\nscrum, which literally blew<br />\nUMBC's scrum off the ball.<br /><br />\nThe Right Angle<br />\nContinued from page 6<br />\nfails as well. Yes, the public is<br />\npaying much higher prices for gas<br />\nnow than it did in July.<br />\nYet despite the oil companies'<br />\ndrop in profits during the crisis,<br />\nAmericans still enjoy some of the<br />\nlowest prices in the world for gas.<br />\nWhile Americans suffer through<br />\nhaving to pay around $1.50 a<br />\ngallon, prices of at least $2, and<br />\nin some places $3 a gallon are<br />\ncommonplace. We still have a<br />\npretty good bargain in this regard.<br />\nBut we wouldn't be so<br />\nvulnerable to foreign influences<br />\nupon our energy prices if we<br />\ncould become more selfsufficient, right? Well, yes, in<br />\nthis point I actually do agree with<br /><br />\nthose in opposition to U.S.<br />\npolicy. We could develop the additional, massive oil fields in<br />\nAlaska so we wouldn't have to<br />\nimport as much oil. We could<br />\nalso resume increasing our<br />\nnuclear power resources so that<br />\nwe could have a cleaner alternative source of energy for the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nBut wait\u2014these ideas certainly aren't acceptable to these protestors. The first would cause a<br />\nfew caribou to be relocated a few<br />\nmiles away in the icy wilderness<br />\nof northwest Alaska. We certain-<br /><br />\nly can't boost our economy at the<br />\ncost of inconveniencing a few<br />\ncaribou. As for the second, the<br />\nidea of depositing wasteful<br />\nmaterial far underground in<br />\nisolated regions of the country in<br />\norder to produce cheap, nonpolluting energy is just too<br />\ndangerous to comprehend.<br />\nThose who don't believe that<br />\nwe should be over in Saudi<br />\nArabia to protect a vital source of<br />\nenergy for this country must<br />\nrealize that they can't have it both<br />\nways. If they don't feel that we<br />\nshould be over there, then they<br /><br />\nshould come up with ways to run<br />\nthis country without this oil and<br />\nalso without using the suggestions<br />\nlisted above (which they probably<br />\nfind impossible to consider).<br />\nMerely criticizing the lifestyles of<br />\n250 million Americans won't<br />\nsolve the problem.<br />\nIn the meantime, apparently<br />\nwith nothing better to do, these<br />\nleft-wing pacifist kooks will continue to rant against this blatant<br />\nexample of U.S. imperialism.<br />\nJust keep checking the letters section of the City Paper; the Great<br />\nConspiracy is certain to return.<br /><br />\nMiranda<br />\nContinued from page 4<br />\n\"Never.

In the second half,<br />\nUMBC scored again to extend<br />\ntheir lead to 12-0. Much of the<br />\nsecond half was spent near<br />\nUMBC's try line as Hopkins tried<br />\nto overcome not only the 12 point<br />\ndeficit but also UMBC's dirty<br />\ntactics and blatant punches. Unfortunately, they could only come<br />\naway with 4 points on a try scored<br />\nby senior wing Joe McCullough.<br />\nMcCullough, battling a stomach<br />\nvirus, took his thin, 120-pound<br />\nframe and weaved'and bulled his<br />\nway into the try zone from 20<br />\nyards out. The kick-after, a difficult one, from the corner of the<br />\nfield, was barely missed. One<br />\nbright spot in the A game was the<br />\nemergence of freshman second<br />\nrow Bill Conig as an offensive<br /><br />\npower. He carried the ball 19<br />\ntimes for 211 yards, most of it in<br />\nthe second half. His comments<br />\nafter the game caused teammates<br />\nto worry, though. He was<br />\noverheard saying, \"I don't<br />\nremember anything in the second<br />\nhalf except that I got hit in the<br />\nhead and Guido scores. Who<br />\nscored by the way?\"<br />\nThe B-side game was<br />\ndominated by Hopkins, as they<br />\nwon, 22-10. They were able to do<br />\nwhat the A-side could not, namely finish the plays into the try<br />\nzone. Gerry Dolan scored two<br />\nquick tries in the first half. The<br />\nfreshman scrumhalf's first score<br />\nwas from close to the try line<br />\nwhile his second was a spectacular 50 meter run through the<br />\nheart of UMBC. The other two<br />\nscores were posted by freshman<br />\nEthan Brown, his second of the<br />\nseason, and Chris Kline.<br /><br />\nCLASSIFIED<br /><br />\nloth):<br />\nTEAMING MATH<br />\nMAY A;LSO<br />\nINVOLVE GROWING<br />\nVEGETABLES10<br />\nIMPROVE sTuDENTs'<br />\nNUTRITION.<br /><br />\nADOPTION.

The editors say that it's journalistic suicide. (Except for Sylvia, who thought it was way<br />\ncool. Kudos.) Nonetheless, on a complete whim, I present to you this week's quiz, the Eva<br />\n\"Don't cry for me, Argentina\" Peron Quiz.<br />\nThe rules are same as they always are. Write your name and your answers on a card or a<br />\npad or a ticket, throw it high in the air, and should it make it to the Gatehouse before 5 o'clock<br />\nWednesday, I will change your way of life for a week or maybe two (however long it takes<br />\nyou to go through a case of beer and ten bucks worth of food). Name me anyone who cares<br />\nas much as your loyal QM.<br />\nBut first a matter of policy. I received a letter this week (mail! I get mail!) from Adrianne<br />\nPierce and Dana Marinacci, two of my entrants from last week, who were concerned about<br />\nlast week's quiz- results being unfair. To recap, I gave the quiz to one of three tied entrants<br />\n(all three of whom had perfect scores after I eliminated my mistake) based on the fact that<br />\nhe had most fully explained my mistake. In doing this, I was not attempting to slight any of<br />\nthe other entrants, I was just trying to find some impartial way to pick one of three equal entries. In the future, in the case of a tie, the winner will be decided by random drawing.(No,<br />\nthat doesn't mean the person whose drawing looks the most random will win.) Also, any entry<br />\ndiscussing Cop Rock will be summarily ignored. Never let it be said that I don't respond well<br />\nto criticism. And Adrianne and Dana. . .1 had nothing to do with those twelve anchovy pizzas<br />\nthat came by your house Thursday.<br />\n1. When was Eva Peron born?<br />\n2.
