Let's go!<br />\nWe begin our tour over here on this lovely stretch of greensward called The Mall. The Mall, as we all know, was named in<br />\nhonor of our distinguished alumnus Fred Mall, inventor of the<br />\nOpposing thumb. Before Mr. Mall's invention, the thumb could<br />\nnot be pressed or clicked against the other fingers. As a result,<br />\nmillions of castanet makers were out of work. Today however,<br />\nthanks to Mr. Mall, one out of every three Americans is gainfully employed making castanets. (The other two make croquet<br />\nwickets.) Mr. Mall is now 106 years old and living in seclusion<br />\non a sea cliff in Wellington, Kansas, but the old gentleman is<br />\nfar from idle. He still works twelve hours a day in his laboratory, and in the last year has invented the tuna, the cuticle,<br />\nand lint.<br />\n<br />\nee olY 6e1'ZT.zl4taez i//es..<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n!s<br />\n<br />\nt\"<br />\nill<br />\nof<br />\nass<br />\nio<br />\n<br />\nis<br />\n<br />\nor<br />\nor<br />\nbe<br />\nhe<br />\nen<br />\n;es<br />\n<br />\nBut I digress. Let us resume our tour. At the end of The<br />\nMall we see a handsome edifice called The Library. Here books<br />\nare kept. By \"kept\" I mean \"kept.\" There is no way in the<br />\nworld for you to get a book out of the library... No, I'm<br />\nwrong. If you hai,e a stack permit you can take out a book,<br />\nbut stack permits are issued only to widows of Presidents of the<br />\nUnited States. (That lady you see coming out of the library<br />\nwith a copy of Girl of the Lintherlost is Mrs. Millard Fillmore.)<br />\nNext to The Library we see the Administration Building.<br />\nHere one finds the president of the university, the deans, and<br />\nthe registrar. According to ancient academic usage,the president<br />\nis always called \"Prexy.\" Similarly, the deans are called \"Dixie\"<br />\nand the registrar is called \"foxy.\" Professors are called \"Proxy\"<br />\nand housemothers are called \"Hoxy-Moxy.\" Students are<br />\ncalled \"Algae.\"<br />\nDiagonally across The Mall we see the Students Union. It is<br />\na gay mad place, frankly dedicated to the fun and relaxation<br />\nof we undergraduates. Here we midergraduates may enjoy<br />\nourselves in one of two ways\u2014with filter or without. We undergraduates who prefer filters, prefer Marlboro, of course. Oh,<br />\nwhat a piece of work is Marlboro! The filter filters, the taste is<br />\nsmooth but not skimpy, mild but not meagre.<br />\nWe undergraduates who prefer non-filters, prefer Philip<br />\nMorris, of corns. It is a natural smoke, a clean smoke, a flavorful, zestful, pure and peaceful smoke ..;Now hear this: Philip<br />\nMorris and Marlboro each come in a choice of two packs\u2014<br />\ncrushproof Flip-Top Box or the familiar Soft Pack.<br />\nSo now, as the setting sun casts a fiery aura over the spires<br />\nand battlements of our beloved campus, let us hie ourselves to<br />\nour tobacconist's and lay in a night's supply of Marlboro or<br />\nPhilip Morris, and then let us, lowing, wind slowly o'er the lea<br />\nto our dormitories and sit upon our army surplus cots, spent<br />\nhut content, and smoke and dream and hark the cprfew toll the<br />\nknell of parting day.

Universities were formerly dedicated to<br />\ncritical analysis, logical reasoning, aesthetic appreciation and<br />\nethical evaluation. Now with the<br />\ndominating influence of the<br />\nGreek letter chapters over the<br />\nmembers of the student body, our<br />\ncolleges are beginning to instill<br />\ninto our American youth such<br />\nmoral qualities as the fighting<br />\nspirit and the will-to-win initiative.<br />\nLike businesses, the average<br />\ncollege fraternity takes into consideration four principal points<br />\nabout the rushee: money', family, preparatory schools and personal qualities. The financial<br />\nstanding of the candidate is of<br />\nno little importance to the fraternity rushing committee. If the<br />\nfreshman's father is an influential man in his home town and<br />\nthe freshman's mother is a social leader, the rushee's chances<br />\nof being bid are materially increased. The social reputation of<br />\nthe preparatory school which he<br />\nattended is also considered of<br />\ngreat importance by the fraternity.<br />\nFour False Criteria<br />\nBut of the four criteria, the<br />\nmatter of \"personality\" stands<br />\nforemost.

However, the<br />\nnew rule provides an option between the kick .(still worth<br />\none point) and a run or pass (good for two points). The<br />\nextra point try also is from the three yard line instead<br />\nof the two.<br />\nThe choice will naturally be most difficult for the<br />\nteam scoring first and for the team that has just ,scored<br />\na touchdown to bring them within one point of their opponent.<br />\nThe chances of scoring from the three yard line by<br />\na run or pass is only one in three. Many teams have<br />\nfailed to score from there in four downs. The average<br />\ncollege kicker is successful in four out of five attempts.<br />\nThe rule change, however, that most of the experts<br />\nfeel will have an even greater effect is the one which says<br />\nthat ineligible pass receivers (center, guards, and tackles)<br />\nare now able to move downfield immediately after the<br />\nreceiver has touched the ball. The significance of this<br />\nchange is that a pass receiver could have five blockers immediately available when he received a forward pass.<br />\nThe other two changes are comparatively minor.

I know all the<br />\nthings you've had to do in the opening days of the school year\u2014<br />\nregistering, paying fees, finding lodgings, entering a drag race,<br />\ngetting married, building a cage for your raccoon. But now,<br />\nwith all these essentials out of the way, let us pause and join<br />\nhands and take, for the first time, a long, leisurely look at our<br />\nCampus.<br />\nReady? Let's go!<br />\nWe begin our tour over here on this lovely stretch of greensward called The Mall. The Mall, as we all know, was named in<br />\nhonor of our distinguished alumnus Fred Mall, inventor of the<br />\nOpposing thumb. Before Mr. Mall's invention, the thumb could<br />\nnot be pressed or clicked against the other fingers. As a result,<br />\nmillions of castanet makers were out of work. Today however,<br />\nthanks to Mr. Mall, one out of every three Americans is gainfully employed making castanets. (The other two make croquet<br />\nwickets.) Mr. Mall is now 106 years old and living in seclusion<br />\non a sea cliff in Wellington, Kansas, but the old gentleman is<br />\nfar from idle. He still works twelve hours a day in his laboratory, and in the last year has invented the tuna, the cuticle,<br />\nand lint.<br /><br />\nee olY 6e1'ZT.zl4taez i//es..<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\n!s<br /><br />\nt\"<br />\nill<br />\nof<br />\nass<br />\nio<br /><br />\nis<br /><br />\nor<br />\nor<br />\nbe<br />\nhe<br />\nen<br />\n;es<br /><br />\nBut I digress. Let us resume our tour. At the end of The<br />\nMall we see a handsome edifice called The Library. Here books<br />\nare kept. By \"kept\" I mean \"kept.\" There is no way in the<br />\nworld for you to get a book out of the library... No, I'm<br />\nwrong. If you hai,e a stack permit you can take out a book,<br />\nbut stack permits are issued only to widows of Presidents of the<br />\nUnited States. (That lady you see coming out of the library<br />\nwith a copy of Girl of the Lintherlost is Mrs. Millard Fillmore.)<br />\nNext to The Library we see the Administration Building.<br />\nHere one finds the president of the university, the deans, and<br />\nthe registrar. According to ancient academic usage,the president<br />\nis always called \"Prexy.\" Similarly, the deans are called \"Dixie\"<br />\nand the registrar is called \"foxy.\" Professors are called \"Proxy\"<br />\nand housemothers are called \"Hoxy-Moxy.\" Students are<br />\ncalled \"Algae.\"<br />\nDiagonally across The Mall we see the Students Union. It is<br />\na gay mad place, frankly dedicated to the fun and relaxation<br />\nof we undergraduates. Here we midergraduates may enjoy<br />\nourselves in one of two ways\u2014with filter or without. We undergraduates who prefer filters, prefer Marlboro, of course. Oh,<br />\nwhat a piece of work is Marlboro! The filter filters, the taste is<br />\nsmooth but not skimpy, mild but not meagre.<br />\nWe undergraduates who prefer non-filters, prefer Philip<br />\nMorris, of corns. It is a natural smoke, a clean smoke, a flavorful, zestful, pure and peaceful smoke ..;Now hear this: Philip<br />\nMorris and Marlboro each come in a choice of two packs\u2014<br />\ncrushproof Flip-Top Box or the familiar Soft Pack.<br />\nSo now, as the setting sun casts a fiery aura over the spires<br />\nand battlements of our beloved campus, let us hie ourselves to<br />\nour tobacconist's and lay in a night's supply of Marlboro or<br />\nPhilip Morris, and then let us, lowing, wind slowly o'er the lea<br />\nto our dormitories and sit upon our army surplus cots, spent<br />\nhut content, and smoke and dream and hark the cprfew toll the<br />\nknell of parting day.

Universities were formerly dedicated to<br />\ncritical analysis, logical reasoning, aesthetic appreciation and<br />\nethical evaluation. Now with the<br />\ndominating influence of the<br />\nGreek letter chapters over the<br />\nmembers of the student body, our<br />\ncolleges are beginning to instill<br />\ninto our American youth such<br />\nmoral qualities as the fighting<br />\nspirit and the will-to-win initiative.<br />\nLike businesses, the average<br />\ncollege fraternity takes into consideration four principal points<br />\nabout the rushee: money', family, preparatory schools and personal qualities. The financial<br />\nstanding of the candidate is of<br />\nno little importance to the fraternity rushing committee. If the<br />\nfreshman's father is an influential man in his home town and<br />\nthe freshman's mother is a social leader, the rushee's chances<br />\nof being bid are materially increased. The social reputation of<br />\nthe preparatory school which he<br />\nattended is also considered of<br />\ngreat importance by the fraternity.<br />\nFour False Criteria<br />\nBut of the four criteria, the<br />\nmatter of \"personality\" stands<br />\nforemost.

However, the<br />\nnew rule provides an option between the kick .(still worth<br />\none point) and a run or pass (good for two points). The<br />\nextra point try also is from the three yard line instead<br />\nof the two.<br />\nThe choice will naturally be most difficult for the<br />\nteam scoring first and for the team that has just ,scored<br />\na touchdown to bring them within one point of their opponent.<br />\nThe chances of scoring from the three yard line by<br />\na run or pass is only one in three. Many teams have<br />\nfailed to score from there in four downs. The average<br />\ncollege kicker is successful in four out of five attempts.<br />\nThe rule change, however, that most of the experts<br />\nfeel will have an even greater effect is the one which says<br />\nthat ineligible pass receivers (center, guards, and tackles)<br />\nare now able to move downfield immediately after the<br />\nreceiver has touched the ball. The significance of this<br />\nchange is that a pass receiver could have five blockers immediately available when he received a forward pass.<br />\nThe other two changes are comparatively minor. In<br />\ncking, only one hand and arm are allowed to make<br />\n'<br />\nbic<br />\nnickname of \"Jackrabbit\" as he dodges between two less<br />\ncontact with an opponent, instead of both arms and hands OZ GARCIA (40) gives meaning to his<br />\ndefenders to score for the Blue Jays in Saturday's game at Homewood<br />\nMarshall<br />\nand<br />\nFranklin<br />\nagile<br />\nas was formerly the case.
