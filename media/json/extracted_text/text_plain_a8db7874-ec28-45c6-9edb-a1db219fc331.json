It was in the form of the<br />\nfirst Vietnam Moratorium, and<br />\nBaltimore, including Hopkins, played an<br />\nimportant role.<br />\nPressure, not confrontation, was the<br />\nstrategy of the demonstrators. The local<br />\nMoratorium was conceived not only to<br />\nput pressure on the Nixon<br />\nAdministration, but force the reluctant<br />\nHopkins administrators to express a<br />\nUniversity policy statement on the war.<br />\nWe Will Succeed<br />\n\"It's putting pressure on the<br />\ngovernment and the administration of<br />\nthe school,\" said Larry Goldberg, one of<br />\nthe principal organizers of the anti-war<br />\nactivities at Hopkins. He termed the<br />\nWednesday demonstrations as a<br />\ngrass-roots movement of all Americans,<br />\nnot just students. \"We showed the<br />\ngovernment what the people really<br />\nwant,\" Goldberg asserted. \"The people<br />\nhere are attempting to influence power,<br />\nand they will succeed.\"<br />\nAnd the pressure was impressive.<br />\nHundreds of thousands of Americans of<br />\nall ages and backgrounds peacefully<br />\nprotested against the war in Southeast<br />\nAsia. Downtown Baltimore was flooded<br />\nby (official estimate)<br />\n18,000 people<br />\nattending the two Federal Plaza rallies.<br />\nAt Wednesday's marches and rallies,<br />\na unity of purpose and a tolerance of all<br />\nseemed to pervade Baltimore's autumn<br />\nweather. Although college students<br />\nmade up the predominant group, blacks<br />\nand over-thirty whites also participated<br />\nin significant numbers.<br />\nTenuous Link<br />\nThe link, however, between the<br />\nstudents and their elders is tenuous and<br />\n<br />\nit is likely to split soon. the young<br />\nradicals in particular, will probably tire<br />\nof the Moratorium's peacful activity in<br />\nthe ensuing months, especially if<br />\nmassive withdrawals of American troops<br />\nare not forthcoming.<br />\nIn Washington the evidence that<br />\nNixon will listen to these protests seems<br />\neven more doubtful this week. On<br />\nSunday, Secretary of State William P.<br />\nRogers cautioned against protests as a<br />\nway to end the war. \"There hasn't been<br />\nany progress in Paris for the last two or<br />\nthree months,\" Rogers stated, \"and I<br />\nwould doubt that there would be any<br />\nprogress unless it is clear that President<br />\nNixon's policy is supported by the<br />\nAmerican people.\"<br />\n<br />\nplc by lemm<br />\n<br />\nWhile Rogers tells Americans to<br />\n\"keep the faith\" in the wisdom of the<br />\nNixon Administration, the President is<br />\nnow repeating Johnson's rhetoric that<br />\nSouth Vietnam is the world's pandora's<br />\nbox, and it is our responsibility to<br />\nkeep it closed.<br />\nIn a letter this week to a Georgetown<br />\nstudent protester, Nixon claimed that a<br />\nspeedy withdrawal from South Vietnam<br />\nwould have disacterous consequences<br />\nplc by battis<br />\n<br />\n\"in both human and international<br />\nterms.\" The President further said that<br />\nthe war involves larger stakes than the<br />\nfate of South Vietnam, and he will not<br />\nsacrifice these stakes to the impatience<br />\nof public opinion.<br />\nYet many people showed on<br />\nWednesday their willingness to protest<br />\nthe war beyond an opinon poll and their<br />\nconviction that they can influence<br />\ngovernment policy. Locally, besides the<br />\nmarches and rallies, about a hundred<br />\ncollege students spent October 15<br />\nleafletting thirteen shopping centers and<br />\nthe downtown business district.<br />\nOn Homewood campus the<br />\nMoratorium Committee and the Student<br />\nCouncil organized a well-attended set of<br />\nactivities. About seven hundred Hopkins<br />\nstudents gathered for the afternoon<br />\nrally in front of Gilman Hall, almost<br />\n7,000 students amassed later in the day<br />\nfor the march downtown and about 250<br />\nprotestors were at the candlelight<br />\nservices Wednesday night.<br />\nOne of the biggest disappointments<br />\nwas the lack of faculty attendance<br />\nduring the Moratorium activities. The<br />\nStudent Council and other students<br />\ntalked to all the professors here about<br />\nMoratorium activities. The Council<br />\nfurthermore picketed classrooms on<br />\nWednesday and put out some anti-war<br />\n<br />\nplc by hoffmann<br />\n<br />\nleaflets.<br />\nThe big question for next month<br />\ncenters around the growing possibility<br />\nof violence if the demands for peace are<br />\nnot heeded. President Nixon announced<br />\nlast week that a major policy statement<br />\non Vietnam will be televized to the<br />\nAmerican people on November 3.<br />\nRegardless of Nixon's stand, the<br />\norganizers of the Moritorium plan to<br />\ngain even more support for their<br />\nacitvities among traditionally liberal<br />\norganizations. The United Automobile<br />\nWorkers, the National Teamster Union<br />\nand the chemical workers union already<br />\nhave endorsed the Moratorium concept.<br />\nBut even with more support,<br />\nfrustration should soon appear once the<br />\nexcitement of Wednesday is forgotten.<br />\nJust how far did the people's voice seep<br />\ninto the minds of the massive<br />\nWashington bureaucracy is the question<br />\nmany people are now asking.<br />\nRecently Vice-President Agnew said<br />\nthat patriotism and protest are<br />\nincompatible. This, plus Rogers' and<br />\nNixon's statements on Sunday, seems<br />\nonce again to ask the American people<br />\nfor patience under the banner of<br />\npatriotism. A significant number of<br />\nAmericans. as the Moratorium cogently<br />\nproved, are not about to heed the<br />\ngovernment's wishes.<br />\n<br />\n'Bullshit and Rhetoric from University<br />\nMr. Bilgrave, who was present at the<br />\nteach-in when the band began to play,<br />\nwould not comment on whether the<br />\nband was in fact \"disruptive.\"<br />\nThe \"extra-curricular suspension\"<br />\nwas, in the words of Jim Archibald,<br />\n\"The worst thing they could have done;<br />\nthe November Moratorium is coming up<br />\nin four weeks and we've lost our<br />\nprincipal organizer for two of them.\"<br />\nGoldberg, a Moratorium organizer,<br />\nexplained that the suspension meant<br />\nthat he could not hold or attend any<br />\nmeeting, do any work at the SA office,<br />\nbut that he could talk to individuals<br />\nabout the Moratorium.<br />\nArchibald talked about University<br />\n'neutrality, in the light of its actions<br />\nconcerning the Moratorium, \"First they<br />\nwon't let us talk to those going to class<br />\non the 15th inside the buildings, then<br />\nthe Rumberger directive, and finally<br />\nthese suspensions.

The radiation dose<br />\nreceived<br />\nfrom cosmic rays and naturally<br />\npic by hoffmann<br />\nradioactive minerals in the earth has<br />\nIndustrial garbage along the banks of the Chesapeake Bay. Many conservationists are concerned<br />\nbeen measured at 100 millirem per year.<br />\nabout radioactive and heat pollution in the Bay caused by a proposed nuclear power plant.<br />\nThe maximum permissable radiation<br />\nlevel specified by the AEC is 5000<br />\nmillirems per year. A person residing<br />\nclose to the plant would receive about<br />\none-half a millirem per year in addition<br />\nto the background radiation. This is<br />\nabout the same amount of radiation one<br />\nwould receive on a transcontinental<br />\nflight simply from cosmic rays. Natural<br />\nradioactive materials in the body deliver<br />\na dose of from 20 to 25 millirems per<br />\nyear.<br />\nNegligible Radiation<br />\nThe radiation problem, therefore, as<br />\nfar as human well-being is concerned, is<br />\nnegligible. To protect people against<br />\naccidental exposure, the plant is<br />\ndesigned to hold up under the worst<br />\npossible accident the engineers could<br />\nimagine. This is one of the many<br />\nrequirements of the AEC.<br />\nThe new plant site was selected only<br />\nafter detailed study of approximately<br />\nfifty different sites, according to a<br />\nstatement presented before the Atomic<br />\nSafety and Licensing Board on May 12.<br />\nThe Bay at the plant site is six miles<br />\nwide, and more than twenty feet deep.<br />\npzc .y zolfmann<br />\nHopkins biologist Dr. H.H.

I apologize for the<br />\nrather hasty form of this letter, but I am<br />\nleaving the country tomorrow for several<br />\nweeks and I felt that the subject had gotten<br />\nsufficiently out of hand as to warrant even a<br />\nroughly drafted statement to the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nI cannot in this short space debate or<br />\nrefute any technical points. I have<br />\nattempted to do this privately and outside<br />\nof the glare of seeing my name in print.<br />\nI personally deplore the tactic of<br />\npromulgating scientific results by publishing<br />\nin a Letters to the Editor column or by<br />\nreporting them to one's Senator or to a<br />\nnewspaper reporter. The concept of<br />\npublishing new and hitherto unknown<br />\nresults in recognized scientific journals<br />\nsubject to review by other scientists is so<br />\nimportant to the continued well-being and<br />\nobjectivity of science as a discipline, that<br />\nthe motives of anyone taking the circuitous<br />\nroutes above might be treated as suspect.<br />\nIt is indeed unfortunate that those of us<br />\n\u2022 in the scientific community who have<br />\n\u2022\u2022 \u2022 #\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nlabored (quietly) in an effort to uncover all<br />\nof the available information relating to<br />\nradiation effects, isotope ingestion effects,<br />\nenvironmental effects etc. ... as well as the<br />\ntheory and practice of nuclear-powered<br />\nreactors, in order to attempt to consider the<br />\nconcept of a nuclear power industry in an<br />\nobjective manner, must be placed in the<br />\nawkward position of either remaining quiet<br />\nin the presence of demagogic and<br />\ninflammatory statements, or of speaking out<br />\nand possibly being relegated to the herd of<br />\nso-called AEC apologists.<br />\nThe AEC is not immoral. To say that it is<br />\nor to say that it is not scientifically truthful<br />\nis to attack the integrity of a large number<br />\nof excellent and dedicated and moral<br />\nscientists, many of whom I know<br />\npersonally. To assert that the AEC knew<br />\nfacts that it did not share with the public or<br />\nto imply that it has \"discovered\" facts<br />\nrecently (which have been known for a<br />\ngeneration) in a field in which the AEC has<br />\nsponsored independent unclassified<br />\nuniversity scientfic research since its<br />\ninception, is irresponsible and morally<br />\nreprehensible.<br />\nI can think of no better way of<br />\nthe public confidence in<br />\ndestroying<br />\nindependent science as an institution in this<br />\ncountry than by impugning the morality of<br />\n\u2022 ft\u2022 \u2022 r\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022AI \u2022<br />\n.\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n:<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n<br />\nthe scientific decision of an independent<br />\ngovernment agency whose main claim to<br />\nbeing is the equality of its science.

This week, the members of the Black Students Union at<br />\nHomewood informed us that they believe they are being made an issue of,<br />\nand not treated as individual human beings.<br />\nIf that is the result of the coverage of the News-Letter, we extend our<br />\napologies. However, the members of the B.S.U. also stated that we should<br />\nkeep out of their affairs (the atmosphere at Homewood for blacks, black<br />\nadmissions, etc.), and not try to help out where we are neither needed nor<br />\nwanted. They took exception to the editorial of last week calling for<br />\nincreased black admissions, saying that the editors, as white men, could<br />\nnot understand the torment of a black man at Hopkins and had best just<br />\nstay out of the entire issue.<br />\nIt is true that we cannot understand what a black man goes through at<br />\nHopkins. As whites, we cannot hope to fully understand what the blacks<br />\nneed or how they feel. However, the fact that a man is white is not<br />\ngrounds for discounting his opinion on issues such as these. The question<br />\nof black admissions relates to both whites and blacks at Homewood. We<br />\nsee no reason to \"keep our nose out of it.\"<br />\nThe Black Student Union stated that News-Letter had slighted black<br />\nstudents and made them seem inferior in the articles. This is simply not<br />\ntrue. We realize that in writing anything about questions of black and<br />\nWhite that we were dealing with a volatile issue. We made every attempt<br />\nnot to lean toward either side in an article such as the Jensen Report or<br />\nthat on black admissions.<br />\nFinally, throughout the discussion, people seemed to be attributing<br />\nmotives to the reporters involved. The allegations made were based on the<br />\nPremise that the reporters were trying to promote one or another point of<br />\nview within their news stories. This is also untrue. The fact that an article<br />\nappears concerning black students says nothing about the reporter's or<br />\nnewspaper's attitude concerning that question. Within the body of the<br />\nstory, every effort is made to rule out personal attitudes.<br />\nThe black students doubtless have a point when they claim that they<br />\nare regarded too much as an issue and not enough as people. However, the<br />\nfact that they do not enjoy seeing articles about blacks in the News-Letter<br />\nand that they may disagree with the editorial policy of the paper cannot<br />\nkeep the stories out of print.<br />\n<br />\nSenate Si, S.C. No<br />\nThe Student Council did a dismal job in appointing students to serve<br />\non the various policy making committees at Homewood. The fact that<br />\nPositions were open was ill publicized. The committee which was<br />\nsupposed to interview applicants did not even get started on its job. The<br />\n<br />\nWAY CO TIIERC<br />\n\u2014<br />\nFE tOUPITV<br />\nVICATRC\u2014<br />\n116<br />\n<br />\nAND MUPITY ft<br />\n\u2014<br />\n<br />\nhectic, make-shift interviews which were arranged for last Tuesday were<br />\nbadly and incompletely conducted, and little was learned about the<br />\nvarious applicants' qualifications. It seems, in fact that some of the<br />\npositions were filled before the interviewing started. Council members<br />\nseemed to have a definite idea of whom they wanted as representatives,<br />\nregardless of how the interviewing progressed.<br />\nHowever, the fact that the Council's procedure on this matter was<br />\nirregular and not conducive to choosing good representatives is tangential.<br />\nWhat is central to the question of students gaining any power at Hopkins<br />\nis whether the concept of chosen representatives can ever work at all. The<br />\nCouncil's bad form in selecting representatives as a symptom of the<br />\nprocess' futility.<br />\nLast year, students were angered that Dean Swanson had chosen<br />\nrepresentatives for the student body without consulting any students.<br />\nNow it seems that the Council has turned around and done the same<br />\nthing. When it comes doen to choosing, representatives, it dawns on people<br />\nthat it isn't very important. No one is going to adequately represent<br />\nstudent opinion, and there is little advantage to be gained by choosing one<br />\nstudent over another.<br />\nWhat this episode in the Council's speckled history proves is that<br />\nrepresentation is not functional and can not be functional even when the<br />\nCouncil(the elected \"voice of the students\") has the opportunity to select<br />\nthe student committee members.<br />\nThis entire problem should be neatly avoided with the creation of the<br />\nuniversity senate. The senate would be an elected body with enough<br />\nmembers and divergent opinions to adequately express the views of the<br />\nstudents. We hope that when it is created, the Student Council and its<br />\ncounterparts in ineptness will be effectively sidestepped in the decision<br />\nmaking process.<br />\n<br />\ncANT<br />\nepr<br />\nMAW 1j CARroNs<br />\n<br />\n50 THAIS<br />\n<br />\nPublishera-lfall Syndicate<br />\n<br />\nAINNIIIIM111111\u2022011\u20221\u202211,<br />\n<br />\n111.1\u2022111111INI.<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n10-12<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 8<br />\n<br />\nN[WS-L NTT E R<br />\n<br />\nOct. 17, 1969<br />\n<br />\nfeatures<br />\n\"Abbey Road\" One Way --Wrong<br />\nBy PRINCE NAMOR<br />\nSix years, do you believe it? Of course not. But it has<br />\nbeen six years since the Beatles leaped to international<br />\npopularity. Beatlemania, the Ed Sullivan Show, 45 songs<br />\nin the Top 40, \"She Loves You\" number one for a<br />\nthousand weeks in a row, twist and shout at junior high<br />\ndances.<br />\nAnd now Abbey Road at the end of six years. A<br />\ntypical Beatle album, a very Beatle album. But if it were<br />\nreleased six years ago, in 1963, it would be very hard to<br />\ndistinguish it from Beatle music of that time period.<br />\nThis is not to deny the \"top pop mop tops\"(a Time<br />\nmagazine phrase) their prominent place in the history of<br />\npopular music. Their lightning advent had enormous<br />\nimpact and almost suffocating influence, to the point<br />\nthat Time and Life hired every pseudo<br />\npsycho-sociologist to explain the \"phenomenon.\" The<br />\nadvances of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band<br />\ncannot be forgotten.<br />\nSimple Tunes<br />\nAfter Sergeant Pepper the Beatles abandoned their<br />\nposition in the vanguard of rock music. They stopped<br />\nbeing revolutionary, stopped being concerned about<br />\n\"new directions.\" Just sat around, counting their<br />\nmoney, watching the rain, and picking out a few simple<br />\ntunes. Ending up with Abbey Road. Their last album,<br />\na two-record set called The Beatles, was an unqualified<br />\ndisaster. They seem to have recovered somewhat with<br />\ntheir latest release. Some simple melodies, some pleasant<br />\nrock. Not much, but that is what the Beatles are doing.<br />\nThe talent of the Beatles has always been in the creation<br />\nof enjoyable, interesting tunes, something to sing along<br />\nwith like \"Hey Jude\" or \"Get Back\". Their musical<br />\ntalents have developed little since Introducing the<br />\nBeatles, their first album. McCartney is an excellent bass<br />\nplayer. But if Harrison were to appear before audiences<br />\nfamiliar with Clapton and Bloomfield, he would not last<br />\nvery long. The same may be said about Lennon and Star.<br />\nHillbilly Trash<br />\nSo the quartet just lounges in a recording studio,<br />\nplaying some nice ditties. Sixteen tunes, with some<br />\nblues, some folk, some country, some Broadway, but all<br />\nessentially rock. The lyrics, once something the<br />\n<br />\nadolescent fan could point to with pride (\"Look Mom,<br />\nsee, I'm not wasting my money on hillbilly trash\") are<br />\nnow of very inconsistent quality, ranging from the<br />\nmore-than-acceptable to the insulting (my God, \"I blew<br />\nmy mind\"; even Business Week has ceased using that<br />\nphrase.)<br />\nThe songs: one of the best is \"Come Together\", the<br />\nfirst cut on the album. Written by John Lennon, it<br />\nfeatures a jazzy arrangement, some interesting drum<br />\nwork, and very Lennonesque \"I Am the Walrus\" lyrics<br />\n(\"he shoots Coca-Cola\"? Okay, if it works.)<br />\nNext comes \"Something\", which, along with \"Here<br />\nConies the Sun\", are George Harrison's compositional<br />\ncontricutions to Abbey Road. Both are embarrassingly<br />\nsimple, annoyingly syrupy, and ultimately soporific.<br />\nRemember in 1964 when Harrison would moan \"Do you<br />\nwant to know a secret?\" and you would yell \"no\" and<br />\nswitch the radio dial. Well, his musical imagination has<br />\nchanged little since.<br />\nIn the Still of the Night<br />\nThe Beatles' predilection for song parody continues<br />\ndown memory lane with \"Oh! Darling\", a McCartney<br />\nsong. It is an almost perfect recapturing of the musical<br />\nstyle of the late 1950's, when people listened to the<br />\nFlamingoes, the Platters, and Lee Andrews and the<br />\nHearts. McCartney's shouting is magnificient, the<br />\nooh-ooh-aah chorus fits in, the echo chamber effect<br />\nworks. Unfortunately, the intrumental accompaniment<br />\nis too complex and involved for the late 50's style.<br />\nNext comes \"Octupus's Garden\", a song which Ringo<br />\nwrote and sang. It is in the cuddly-cute mold of \"Yellow<br />\nSubmarine\", with childish \"Good Ship Lollipop\" lyrics<br />\nabout escaping to an underwater paradise. I am<br />\nconvinced that the cute but stupid Ringo we all think of<br />\nis part of the greatest and most elaborately executed<br />\nput-on in Western culture, that he is actually an<br />\narticulate genius and sage with a 200+ IQ and an<br />\ninfinitely creative imagination. Just wait. You'll see.<br />\n\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" is a Lennon song,<br />\nwith Lennon singing and playing lead guitar. A slow and<br />\nuneventful blues song that seems interminable. But the<br />\ninstrumental break does remind me of the long-gone<br />\ndays when the instrumental was always an obvious<br />\nvariation of the basic melody of the song itself.<br />\n<br />\nSide two of Abbey Road geatures an eight song<br />\nfifteen minute medle . Basically it is all rock, good rock,<br />\nnever being worse than listenable. As a medley the songs<br />\ndo not fit together successfully; the repetition of \"You<br />\nNever Give Me Your Money\" at the end is not enough to<br />\nunify the whole piece. Also, I must complain that<br />\n\"Polythene Pam\" is too short.<br />\nAlas, dear friends, one can become readily tired of<br />\nlistening to Abbey Road. But there is a new Beatles<br />\nalbum, called Get Back, to be released in early January.<br />\ncontaining eleven songs, a photo book of the recording<br />\nsession and a film of that session. The new album, which<br />\nwas completed before Abbey Road was even begun, is<br />\nintended to be a retrogression to the Beatles of six years<br />\nago, the handsome young idols who didn't take dope or<br />\ncomment on the unpopularity of Jeasus. I don't think<br />\nthere will be much difference between Abbey Road and<br />\nGet Back.<br />\n<br />\nLudwig von Beethoven, if he were alive today, would<br />\nprobably dislike the Beatles new album, Abbey Road.<br />\n<br />\nWill the Real Nixon Please Sit Down<br />\nBy MARK AMSLER<br />\nRichard Nixon knows the value of television in<br />\npolitics. After John Kennedy won the 1960 presidential<br />\nelection, Marshall McLuhan commented, \"Without TV,<br />\nNixon had it made.\" Television as a medium was more<br />\nreceptive to the nonchalant, easy flowing attitude which<br />\nKennedy projected then it was to Nixon's cold<br />\naloofness. And Kennedy won.<br />\nSo the decision to run in 1968 was a difficult one for<br />\nNixon's ego to make. He had been hurt by the television<br />\ngame and he knew it. It was just some dirty Eastern<br />\nliberal trick to defeat him and it had worked. And so he<br />\nhad retired bitterly to the safety of Wall Street to nurse<br />\nhis wounds and bide his time. Now, in 1968 he would be<br />\nready for them. He would play their game.<br />\nIn a preliminary advisory meeting with his staff just<br />\nafter he had won the Republican nomination for<br />\nPresident, Nixon said, \"We're going to build this whole<br />\ncampaign around television. You fellows just tell me<br />\nwhat you want me to do and I'll do it.\" The job was to<br />\nsell Richard Nixon as the most likely candidate for<br />\nPresident of the United States.<br />\nHuman Nature<br />\nJoe McGinniss, author of The Selling of the President<br />\n1968, wondered if indeed a presidential candidate could<br />\nbe packaged and sold like a used car. To find out,<br />\nMcGinniss \"joined\" the Nixon campaign staff and spent<br />\nmost of his time traveling with the writers, technicians,<br />\nspecialists, and pollsters who put together the image of a<br />\nman. \"That there is a difference between the individual<br />\nald his image,\" writes the author, \"is human nature. Or<br />\nAmerican nature, at least. That the difference is<br />\nexaggerated and exploited electronically is the reason for<br />\nthis book.\"<br />\nThe difference between a man and his image,<br />\n\"exaggerated and exploited\", is also the substance of<br />\nMcGinniss' book. One doesn't read this book to find out<br />\nabout Richard Nixon. Instead, the reader learns a great<br />\ndeal about the American advertising industry and its<br />\ntremendous power over the minds of the American<br />\npeople. Advertising is a complete subject which is able to<br />\n<br />\nshape opinions with the minutest of details. In a taping<br />\nsession for one of Nixon's short campaign<br />\n\"commercials\", there was great concern over how to<br />\nbring out the backdrop of shuttered windows and two<br />\nsets of bookcases.<br />\nThe purpose of these items was to project not only a<br />\nphysical but a psychological lightness as well during the<br />\ncandidate's speech. Makeup, it seems, was not the only<br />\nreason Nixon lost in 1960. And in 1968 there were<br />\nplenty of specialists on hand to project the right image<br />\nof Nixon as a worthwhile presidential candidate. Nixon<br />\nlost in 1960 because he was too few of the things a<br />\nPresident should be and there was no one to lie for him.<br />\nIn 1968 there was a whole advertising staff ready to<br />\nbuild him a proper image.<br />\nSyrupy Style<br />\n\"Politics,\" says McGinniss, \"has always been a con<br />\ngame.\" When Eisenhower ran for reelection in 1956. the<br />\nagency of Batton, Barton, Durstine, and Osburn<br />\naccepted his campaign as a regular account. The previous<br />\nfour years they had been on the EisenhoWer payroll.<br />\nLeonard Hall, then national Republican chairman,<br />\nexplained the firm's purpose: \"You sell your candidate<br />\nand your programs the way a business sells its products.\"<br />\nThe situation has not changed much in twelve years.<br />\nKennedy hired an advertising firm for his campaign and<br />\nwas surrounded by men who were specialists in the art<br />\nimage building. Johnson suffered from television<br />\nexposure because or his thick, syrupy style which had<br />\nworked so well in the closed office meetings in the<br />\nSenate. Hubert Humphrey was hurt by television since<br />\nthe medium could not fully cooperate with his<br />\n\"excesses\", his ramblings and indirectiveness.<br />\nTelevision demands a free moving, witty, nonchalant<br />\napproach, one with smooth elegance, such as the<br />\nqualities found in Eugene McCarthy. These are not<br />\nqualities which necessarily make a good president. In<br />\nfact, they are not even political judgements. They have<br />\nnothing to do with a man's ability in office. They are<br />\nmerely those qualities which are the best suited for<br />\npresentation over television. And they are the qualities<br />\n<br />\nwhich Nixon sought to project to the American people.<br />\nCat Named Shakespeare<br />\nThe people who gave Nixon an image acceptable to<br />\nthe people were professionals. Gene Jones, one of the<br />\nplanners and directors of Nixon's television campaign.<br />\nput it bluntly: \"I'm a professional. This is a professional<br />\njob. I was neutral toward Nixon when I started. Now I<br />\nhappen to be for him. But that's not the point. The<br />\npoint is, for the money.

MENDELSOHN<br />\nA crisis is at hand in the affairs of<br />\ngur Alton. Having been nominated for<br />\nPresident, he must commence a<br />\ncampaign that will lead to the White<br />\nHouse, to obscurity, or possibly to<br />\nboth. Fortunately, in 1904, a candidate<br />\nrequired no imagination to start his<br />\ncampaign. All campaigns commenced in<br />\nan authentic American folk ritual<br />\ngenerically known as the Notification of<br />\nAcceptance.<br />\nThe idea of the ceremony was that<br />\nthe National Convention would appoint<br />\na delegation to go to the candidate's<br />\ndomicile. The chairman of the<br />\ndelegation would inform the candidate<br />\nof his nomination, and the candidate<br />\nwould respond with his speech of<br />\nacceptance. Long years ago, there was a<br />\nnecessity to inform candidates of their<br />\nnominations. Zachary Taylor, for<br />\ninstance, did not know of his<br />\nnomination until the news was mailed<br />\nto him. By 1904 there was no<br />\neducational function in the notification,<br />\nand the purpose of the ceremony was to<br />\nprovide a lavishly publicized forum for a<br />\ncandidate's first campaign speech.<br />\nOne should not think that the<br />\ngenerations who had to suffer through<br />\nthem accepted the notification<br />\nceremonies with entire seriousness.<br />\nThere were quadrennial parodies of<br />\nnotifications. One of the best, as well as<br />\none of the most easily accessible, is a<br />\nPiece by the pseudonymous Artemas<br />\nWard entitled \"How Old Abe Received<br />\nThe News of His Nomination.\"<br />\n<br />\nOne point of interest in the 1904<br />\nDemocratic ceremonies is that nature<br />\nexceeded art. -A common characteristic<br />\nof the parodies was to mock the<br />\ncandidates' choosing to be nominated in<br />\nwholesome small towns. No one could<br />\nhave parodied the choice of towns when<br />\nParker received his notification in<br />\nEsopus, New York arid running mate<br />\nDavis chose to be notified in White<br />\nSulphur Springs, West Virginia.<br />\nThe Parker notification occurred<br />\nnear the extensive parker estate in<br />\nEsopus on August 10. A rising young<br />\nDemocrat, Representative Champ Clark<br />\nof Missouri, had the privilege of<br />\ndelivering the notification speech as<br />\nChairman of the Notification<br />\nCommittee. Clark's speech was of the<br />\ngeneric type known as Presidential<br />\nNotification Addresses, and it was<br />\nneither conspicuously better nor<br />\nconspicuously worse than all but a few<br />\nof the others.<br />\nClark extolled party regularity as<br />\noffering the best avenue of service to<br />\nthe nation, observed that American<br />\nfavored \"reverence for the Constitution<br />\nand obedience to law,\" characterized<br />\nthe recent Democratic Convention as<br />\nsplendid in its freedom of discourse and<br />\nnoted that the Convention advocated<br />\n\"restoring the government to the<br />\nprinciples advocated by the fathers.<br />\n\"The fathers of whom Mr. Clark was<br />\nspeaking were not in attendance to<br />\ngainsay him, so it must have been<br />\nassumed by Clark's auditors that Parker<br />\nhad the support of people like Jefferson<br />\nand Madison.<br />\n<br />\nThis is your last chance...<br />\nWould You Like to Start Your Own Library of<br />\nObscure Historical Works?

He condemned the<br />\nadministration for fostering trusts, but<br />\nforeclosed the possibility of corrective<br />\nlegislation, saying the trusts could be<br />\ndealt with through \"common law.\" He<br />\ncondemned the high rates of the<br />\nDingley Tariff, but suggested that<br />\nbusiness would require time to adjust to<br />\na tariff revision, and also that change<br />\nwould be very difficult to achieve until<br />\nboth houses of Congress and the<br />\nPresident concurred on the need for<br />\nrevision. This last point may appear a<br />\nsimple truism, but as it was<br />\nmathematically extremely difficult for<br />\nthe Democrats to gain control of the<br />\nSenate in 1904, Parker was indicating<br />\nthat there would be revision only at an<br />\nindeterminate point in the future.<br />\nParker's position on foreign affairs<br />\nseemed a considerable softening of the<br />\nstridency of Bryan's 1900 campaign<br />\nagainst colonialism. Parker said he<br />\nwould give \"self-government\" to the<br />\nPhilippines \"as soon as they are<br />\nreasonably prepared for it.\" Again,<br />\naction is promised, but only at an<br />\nindeterminate period in the future, after<br />\npresent conditions have gradually<br />\nchanged. Parker obviously lacked an<br />\nactivist view of executive authority, and<br />\nhe had no ambition to show<br />\naccomplishment in a short period of<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe declaration on the Philippines<br />\nwas a particular source of criticism and<br />\ncharges of ambivalence. Parker made a<br />\nsemantic quarrel inevitable when he<br />\npledged, sometime, \"self-government\"<br />\ndid not preclude some form of<br />\nassociation or even federation with the<br />\nUnited States, it was suggested that<br />\nParker did not differ from the<br />\nRepublican position on how to govern<br />\nthe Philippines.<br />\nParker had sufficient consciousness<br />\nof these criticisms to write a clarifying<br />\nacceptance letter to the notification<br />\ncommittee. Acceptance letters had been<br />\ntraditional in thy days before<br />\nnotification ceremonies. They have been<br />\nmuch shorter than the ambitious missive<br />\nin which Parker sought to establish his<br />\nown consistency and meanwhile seize<br />\nthe offensive against Roosevelt.<br />\nThere followed Parker, who<br />\nexceeded Jefferson in ability to project<br />\nhis voice; and while he did not exceed<br />\nJefferson in much else, this latter talent<br />\nwas his greatest need in the ceremony at<br />\n<br />\nEsopus. Parker's first campaign speech<br />\ncontained no basic surprises, but a stress<br />\non his own conservatism in contrast to<br />\nthe alleged impetuousity of President<br />\nRoosevelt. Parker observed that the<br />\nspirit of the Democratic platform<br />\n\"assures conservative instead of rash<br />\naction.\" He drew a distinction between<br />\n\"constitutionalism,\" which he<br />\npromised, and \"imperialism.\" The latter<br />\nterm refers not to foreign policy, but<br />\ncontains the suggestion that President<br />\nRoosevelt sought powers befitting an<br />\nemperor.<br />\nVery little was actually clarified.<br />\nParker explained that when he said<br />\n\"self-government\" he meant<br />\n\"independence,\" but he still had<br />\nnothing to say as to when independence<br />\ncould reasonably be expected. He also<br />\nsaid that he had not meant to say that<br />\ntariff reform awaited the election of a<br />\nDemocratic Senate. He said that he<br />\nwould expect the support of the<br />\nRepublican revisionists in Congress, and<br />\nthat in any event the Congress would<br />\nrespect his election to the Presidency as<br />\na mandate for tariff reform.<br />\nIt is always embarrassing for a<br />\ncandidate to have to rephrase his<br />\npositions. Parker attempted to scald<br />\nRoosevelt, but apparently his<br />\ndisagreements with the President were<br />\nlimited to legal niceities. Thus, Parker<br />\nsaid that it might be a source of regret<br />\nthat Roosevelt had obtained the Panama<br />\nCanal in an aggressive manner. However,<br />\nhe accepted the action and pledged to<br />\nbuild the Canal as fast as possible.<br />\nParker also criticized the President<br />\nfor extending the scope of veterans'<br />\npensions by declaration, asserting that<br />\nthis power was vested in Congress.<br />\nParker's suggested remedy was to revoke<br />\nthe Presidential order while persuading<br />\nCongress to extend pensions as<br />\nRoosevelt had provided. This matter<br />\nmay have been momentous to Parker,<br />\nbut the veterans could only be expected<br />\nto prefer Roosevelt's direct approach to<br />\nthe same end.<br />\nThe Parker documents indicate a<br />\ncandidate devoted to conservatism who<br />\nwas nevertheless at pains to assure the<br />\npeople that they would retain the gains<br />\nsecured by the dynamic approach of<br />\nRoosevelt. He merely promised to make<br />\neverything more economical. At this<br />\npoint Parker was sounding an uncertain<br />\ntrumpet.

Well, two outa three ain't bad.<br />\nUnexpected Cliches<br />\nThe Pirandello play was remarkably similar to Albee's<br />\nThe Zoo Story, in which director Wattles played last<br />\nspring. The faithful actor does not seem to have<br />\nforgotten learned lessons. The \"flower\" of the play is a<br />\nmailgnant tumor growing on the lip of a blunt Albee-like<br />\na character who tries to shake a slow-witted and<br />\ncomplacent commuter into facing the nature of death.<br />\nIt is difficult play composed of extended philosophic<br />\nmonologues which have to be underplayed. In short, it is<br />\na play requiring the utmost in subtle disciplined<br />\nacting\u2014clearly not for unskilled freshmen.<br />\n<br />\nThe Ugly Duckling is an almost impossible play to<br />\nruin.

My<br />\nprofessional specialties include the<br />\nprediction of academic achievement,<br />\nand I have done research in that area for<br />\nmany years. My findings and point of<br />\nview are congruent with those of other<br />\nmeasurement specialists such as Lloyd<br />\nG. Humphreys of the University of<br />\nIllinois (see his letter in Science, 10<br />\nOctober 1969, p. 167).<br />\nMr. Reutter tried hard to present<br />\nseveral points of view. I fear, however,<br />\nthat the typical reader may conclude<br />\nthat Hopkins offers admission each year<br />\nto few (or even no) black applicants,<br />\nwhen in fact if all accepted black<br />\napplicants actually came to Hopkins<br />\nrather than going elsewhere the<br />\nfreshman class would have more than<br />\n10% blacks in it. Even with severe<br />\ncompetition from the Ivy League and<br />\nelsewhere, about 3% of our freshmen<br />\nare black. I feel sure that Director of<br />\nAdmissions William Brinkley would be<br />\nglad to prepare a detailed report on<br />\nblack applicants and black enrollees for<br />\nthe News-Letter, if asked to do so.<br />\nA few other comments might be<br />\nclarifying. I emphasized to Mr. Reutter<br />\nthat tutoring, remedial courses, and<br />\ncoaching have not been found effective<br />\nenough to bridge much of a gap<br />\nbetween academically severely<br />\nunderqualified freshmen and at least<br />\nmininzally qualified freshmen. For<br />\nexample, ti ere is published evidence<br />\nfrom the directors of comprehensive<br />\nprograms at Berkeley and Michigan<br />\nState that their success was not, to put<br />\nit mildly, spectacular.<br />\nMost of the thirteen students Mr.<br />\nCotter wanted accepted en masse were<br />\nvastly below Hopkins usual minimum<br />\nadmission requirements which respect<br />\nto test scores and high-school grades.<br />\nMr. Cotter's statements on page 16<br />\n\"that only one of the five students who<br />\nCAN YOU USE SOME<br />\nEXTRA BREAD?<br />\n<br />\ntook the SAT scored below 300\" and<br />\nthat \"one student received scores 657<br />\nverbal and 591 math ...\" are misleading<br />\nbecause most of the SAT scores were far<br />\nbelow Hopkins' lowest-scoring normally<br />\nadmitted freshmen, and the 657 and<br />\n591 were not earned by a black student.<br />\nThe average SAT-Verbal score of entering<br />\nfreshmen at Hopkins is about 640-650,<br />\nand only 3% of its students (including<br />\nspecially admitted ones) score below<br />\n500. According to S.A. Kendrick,<br />\nwriting in the College Board Review,<br />\nonly one or two percent of all black<br />\nhigh-school seniors score above 500 on<br />\nSAT-V.<br />\nCorn plicati ng the low-test-score<br />\nproblem, however, are the generally low<br />\ngradepoint averages earned in many<br />\ninner-city high schools. For example, in<br />\nhis College Board Revies report on his<br />\nspecial program at Michigan State Vice<br />\nPresident Sabine noted that only 3% of<br />\nsophomores and juniors in Detroit high<br />\nschools had a \"B\" average or better. To<br />\nsucceed academically at Hopkins an<br />\nentering student needs at least<br />\nupper-20% ability on College Board<br />\ntests and demonstrated ability to earn<br />\ngood grades. Most colleges and<br />\nuniversities do not have curricula as<br />\ndemanding as Hopkins, so the applicant<br />\nwho is quite underqualified<br />\nacademically for Hopkins may succeed<br />\nelsewhere. In my open letter I urge that<br />\nhe be helped to attentd a college more<br />\ncongruent with his developed academic<br />\nabilities, rather than embarking on a<br />\nlong, expensive attempt to make<br />\nHopkins into a partly open-door<br />\ncommunity college. Quite likely<br />\nBaltimore does need such an institution,<br />\nbecause the Community College of<br />\nBaltimore does not seem open\u2014door in<br />\nthe same sense that the California junior<br />\ncolleges are, but neither historically nor<br />\nin terms of its present limited<br />\nspecialized resources is Hopkins able to<br />\ntake on that role effectively.<br />\nPresumably, Mr. Cotter wants to force<br />\nHopkins to change in that direction in<br />\nCCNY fashion, but much such change<br />\nwould probably spell the end of<br />\nHopkins as the top-level institution it<br />\nhas been since 1876. 1 predict that it<br />\nwould quickly become neither a fine<br />\nopen-door community college nor a<br />\nplace where exceptionally able males of<br />\nvarious backgrounds would thrive, a fate<br />\n<br />\nthat seems inevitable for CCNY.<br />\nProbably the strongest evidence that<br />\nMr. Cotter's proposal was not in the<br />\nbest interests of the twelve black<br />\nstudents themselves is his failure to<br />\nconvince Assistant Director of<br />\nAdmissions Ronald Owens that they were<br />\nnot being used as pawns in a power play<br />\nagainst the University. Mr. Owens,<br />\nperhaps more than anyone else on<br />\ncampus, has the ultimate welfare of<br />\nsuch students paramount in his<br />\nthinking.<br />\nTwo technical points may be worth<br />\nexamining. Firstly, how many<br />\nHopkins-level black male high-school<br />\ngraduates become available each year? A<br />\nfew rough calculations will quickly give<br />\nus an approximate figure. If 3,500,000<br />\nbabies are born in the United States<br />\nduring a given year, 6% of them are<br />\nblack males, half of those black males<br />\ngraduate from high school, 2% of those<br />\ngraduates score 500 or more on SAT-V,<br />\nand half of those have high\u2014enough<br />\ngrades, we find the number to be 1,050.<br />\nCompare that figure with the 3,000 for<br />\nboth sexes in my open letter (black<br />\nwomen seem academically abler, on the<br />\naverage, than black men, and more<br />\npersistent and successful in school). The<br />\nfigure of 33,000 at the close of Mr.<br />\nReutter's article seems greatly inflated;<br />\neven 3,500,000x12%x2% is only 8,400.<br />\nHe seems to have reported about four<br />\ntimes that\u2014the total number of<br />\nfairly-high-test-score blacks of both<br />\nsexes in all four years of high school?<br />\nEven then, one must make allowance<br />\nfor non-graduation from secondary<br />\nschool.<br />\nFinally, the classified ad was good<br />\nfun, but the average Hopkins freshman<br />\ndoes not have an IQ of 140 or SAT-V<br />\nplus SAT-M score of 1500, nor (if he is<br />\nblack) does he need his \"own financial<br />\nresources.\" As noted above, one can get<br />\ninto Hopkins in some curricula with an<br />\nSAT total of 1000 or even less, and the<br />\nIQ of the typical SAT-V 500 student is<br />\nprobably less than 120. The IQ<br />\ncorresponding to an SAT-V score of 650<br />\nis probably less than 135; slightly more<br />\nthan half of Hopkins freshmen are<br />\nbelow that. By comparison, the average<br />\nrecipient of a Ph.D. degree in biological<br />\nor physical science in the United States<br />\nhas an IQ of about 130.<br />\nIt would seem that the editors of the<br />\n<br />\nFUN WORKING IN EUROPE<br />\n<br />\nEd. note\u2014As reported in the September<br />\n26, 1969 issue of the N-L, 37 blacks<br />\nwere accepted to Hopkins last year out<br />\nof approximately 1,000 students<br />\nadmitted, or 3.7 per cent of the class<br />\nwas black. Of the 540 students who<br />\nentered the freshman class, 14 were<br />\nblack, or 2.6 per cent. Even if all the<br />\nblacks accepted to Hopkins actually<br />\ncame, the freshmen class would be less<br />\nthan 7 per cent black (37 out of 540),<br />\nnot \"more than 10 per cent black\" as<br />\nDr. Stanley contends.<br />\n<br />\nBLACK ADMISSIONS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe problem of the University's<br />\nresponsibilities toward alleviating the<br />\ninstitutional racism apparent in the<br />\neducational system of this country is a<br />\nvery complex one indeed.

Five of those nine games were<br />\nshut outs for the Blue Jay defenseman. Under the<br />\ntutelage of part-time coach Bobby Lyons, the team's<br />\nonly loss was a 2-1 affair to Maryland, but in the last<br />\ngame of the season the team came back to blank the<br />\nTerps, 3-0.<br />\nBobby Knauff's 1969 eleven just might equal or<br />\nbreak that record. Just as they might surpass the 1952<br />\nrecord for most goals in one season (29 in ten games.)<br />\nThe 1969 team could be the greatest soccer team ever to<br />\nwear a Hopkins uniform.<br />\nIn its last two games, Dickinson and Delaware fell 4-0<br />\nand 4-1 as Blue Jay fans witnessed some of the best<br />\nsoccer every played at the Hop. Not to be little the<br />\nexcellent coaching of Bob Knauff, much of the success<br />\nof this year's team belongs to former head coach Gary<br />\nBarrette. Barette was responsible for recruiting much if<br />\nnot all of the crop of sophomore talent that has kept the<br />\nJays winning.<br />\nEarly Doubts<br />\nIn the beginning of the season, there were doubts as<br />\nto whether the starting forward line would gel enough<br />\nbefore the start of the season to make the attack potent.<br />\nWell doubters can rest easy. Centerforward Bernie<br />\nWenker, who played is high school ball at Poly, has high<br />\nscoring sophomore sensation Scott Tyner (three goals in<br />\ntwo games) and juilior Ron Rowes (two goals) on the<br />\nwings to help out in the scoring column. Also adding<br />\nconsiderable punch to the first line are co-Captain Dave<br />\nRoberts, and the talkative sophomore Bob Szeles.<br />\nAt halfback, co-Captain Randy Miller is a shoe-in for<br />\nAl1=South honors again as he has turned in consistent<br />\nperformances for three years for the Blue Jay Booters.<br />\nAt the other halfback slot is another sophomore Wes<br />\nDaub\u2014a former preppy from Suffield. Daub is the<br />\nbiggest hustler on the team. Junior tochead Dan Hall is<br />\non the sidelines ready to spell Wes if he should get tired.<br />\nThe heart of the Hop defense lies in its senior<br />\nfullbacks, Rick Tobey and John Clisham. At 6-1 195<br />\npounds Clish puts fear into the hearts of opposing<br />\nlineman. The third fullbback Bob Parsley should have<br />\nmany more good games ahead of him in his soccer career<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nIn the goal are the surehands of junior Steve Weiss.<br />\nRumor has it that Steve plays a much better game of<br />\nsoccer than bridge. Backing Weiss is 200 pounder Steve<br />\nBuescher, the biggest man on the squad.

The game was almost<br />\ncompletely dominated by Hopkins from the opening<br />\nmoments. despite the great number of penalities called<br />\nby the referees.<br />\nThe first score cam within the first three minutes of<br />\nthe first quarter when Bob Szeles took a centering pass<br />\nfrom Bernie Wenker and drilled it past the goalie.<br />\nHopkins also had many other opportunities to score<br />\nduring this period, but several crosses by Scott Tyner to<br />\nSzeles and Wenker in front of the net were unable to be<br />\ncapitalized upon. A corner kick by Hopkins almost<br />\nresulted in a score, as Randy Miller just missed putting<br />\nthe ball into the net. The closest Dickinson came to<br />\nscoreing was on an indirect kick resulting from a<br />\n\"shoving off penalty\", though the ball eventually went<br />\nout of bounds without any harm being done.<br />\nThe second quarter was marked by a rash of penalties<br />\nagainst Dickinson, though several penalities were also<br />\ngiven to our left wind, Scott Tyner.

Near the end<br />\nof the quarter, after Hopkins had failed to convert<br />\nseveral direct kicks into scores, Bob Szeles kicked a ball<br />\nwhich goalie George Holiday fumbled in front of the<br />\nnet. Tyner took the ball and arched it into the corner of<br />\nthe empty net for Hopkins' second score. The score at<br />\nhalftime was 2-0, Hopkins' favor.<br />\nAt the start of the third quarter, Hopkins again took<br />\nover where it had left off. There were at least three<br />\ncorner kicks by Ron Rowes and Scott Tyner, seceral<br />\nindirect kicks by Miller and Roberts, and several<br />\nbeautiful shots by Tyner, all of which failed to increase<br />\nthe score.<br />\nTen minutes into the quarter, though, Bob Szeles,<br />\npassed the ball to Rowes, who shot it into the far left<br />\ncorner of the net. Brown, a new goalie, had no chance,<br />\nand this goal seemed to psych Hopkins up even more.<br />\nThey kept dominating Dickinson, until the last few<br />\nminutes of the third quarter. The Hopkins' defense then<br />\nbegan to demonstrate its prowess. Several shots were<br />\nblocked, including one by Wing Chris Abernathy, which<br />\nRick Tobey headed out of bounds just before the<br />\nquarter ended.<br />\nThe fourth quarter was marked by great defensive<br />\nplays by Goalie Steve Weiss, who gathered in three close<br />\nshots by Abernathy and Rick Drake. Weiss was assisted<br />\nby fullback Bob Parsley, and halfback Wes Daub. Dave<br />\nRoberts also blocked a lot of passes and kept Hopkins<br />\ngoing on offense. At thirteen minutes into the quarter,<br />\nTyner got a pass from Bernie Wenker and shot the ball<br />\npast Pete Brown for Hopkins' final score.<br />\nThe only other excitement in the game came late in<br />\nthe fourth quarter, when new goalie, Steve Buescher,<br />\nstopped a shot, but forgot to dribble the ball before<br />\npassing it. An indirect kick resulted, but it was blocked,<br />\nand didn't amount to anything. The rest of the game was<br />\ndominated again by Hopkins' offense, trying to<br />\ncapitalize on a pushing and tripping penalty. The final<br />\nscore was Hopkins, 4, Dickinson, 0.<br />\nIn conclusion, Hopkins should have a very fine<br />\nseason, if the first two games are any representation. The<br />\nDickinson game simply represented another fine<br />\nperformance by John Clisham, Rich Tobey, and Steve<br />\nWeiss, in addition to an overpowering offensive drive by<br />\nBob Szeles, Scott Tyner and others.<br />\nTomorrow the Jays are at Swarthmore, and they<br />\nshould avenge last year's 1-0 loss with quite a vengence.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 5, Swarthmore 0.<br />\n<br />\n\f)69<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 15<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nOct. 17, 1969<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\nUrsinus Bears Upset Hopkins, 19-14<br />\nBy MARK HELLER<br />\nThe Hopkins football team was upset last<br />\nSaturday by Ursinus; 19 to 14. The Blue Jays,<br />\nwho sparkled disorganized football for much of<br />\nthe remainder of the game. There also seemed<br />\nevident, a lack of hustle especially in the second<br />\n'half, as proved by numerous mistakes, penalties,<br />\nand a general lack of offensive power.<br />\nUrsinus, coming into the contest, had no victories to<br />\nits credit in two games. They ' were the obvious<br />\nunderdogs and as such, were out to upset the undefeated<br />\nBlue Jays. However, after the first quarter, it appeared as<br />\nif there would be no doubt as to the final outcome of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nHopkins scored touchdowns the second and third<br />\ntimes the offense had the ball. Strong running by Paul<br />\nWeiss and Steve Hata, Weiss looked particularly sharp,<br />\nand a pass play from ebb Pfeiffer to Hata, brought the<br />\nball deep into Ursinus territory. Pfeiffer then threw to<br />\nLatson on the Ursinus eight. Following this paly, Paul<br />\nWeiss drove off left tackle for the score.<br />\nThe Bears second attempted drive was halted when<br />\nAlton Cleveland intercepted a Pete Shuman pass at the<br />\nUrsinus 47. Again, Hopkins moved downfield, this<br />\nsequence highlighted by a fine one-handed catch by end<br />\nSteve Latson, bringing the ball to the Bear 26. Weiss,<br />\n<br />\na costly Hopkins holding penalty. A three yard pass<br />\nfrom Shuman to Felix Narog scored the first<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nThe Ursinus second touchdown dirve occurred early<br />\nin the second half, following a fumble by Bob Pfeiffer at<br />\nthe Bear 39 yard line. Again, Ursinus took to the air,<br />\nscoring the touchdown after five completed passes put<br />\nthe ball on the Hopkins two. Joe Corvaia ran for the<br />\nscore<br />\nAfter Ursinus' third touchdown, they were able to<br />\nconsume valuable time by sweeping the Hopkins'<br />\ndefensive ends for important yardage, while preventing<br />\nthe Blue Jays from gaining possession of the ball.<br />\nOffensively, when the Blue Jays finally got the ball,<br />\nthey were flat and inconsistent, never being able to move<br />\nthe ball downfield for a long period of time.<br />\nQuarterback Pfeiffer was yanked in favor of sub Dan<br />\nAugustine. However, Pfeiffer returned when Augustine<br />\nmet with limited success.<br />\n<br />\nshowing good determination and power, took the ball on<br />\nan end sweep to the eight, where Pfeiffer on the<br />\nquarterback option, ran in for the score. Hopkins led 14<br />\nto O.<br />\nHere, however, is where the game ends, from the<br />\nHopkins standpoint. They mounted only one more<br />\nsubstantial offensive threat, which was stopped by a<br />\nfumble. The Blue Jays appeared content to sit on their<br />\nlead, which naturally is impossible, when three quarters<br />\nof the game have yet to be played.<br />\nDefensively, the Hopkins team found it difficult to<br />\ncontain Ursinus' sweeps and short quick passes. The<br />\nmain fault, though, of the defensive team was its<br />\ninability to stop the Bears' third down plays, which are<br />\nso very crucial to the outcome of any football game. In<br />\nUrsinus' third and winning touchdown drive,<br />\nquarterback Pete Shuman completed three third down<br />\npasses which were good for first downs, to end Mike<br />\nMangan. With a third down and five situation, at the<br />\nBlue Jays' 21, Shuman hit Mangan who broke several<br />\ntackles and carried the ball to the five, from where,<br />\nUrsinus scored on an end sweep for the winning<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nUrsinus' first two drives for scores, were highlighted<br />\nby a potent passing attack. Towards the end of the<br />\nsecond quarter, Ursinus scored its first touchdown.<br />\nFrom their own 29, the Bears marched downfield. They<br />\ngained most ground through the air, being aided also by<br />\n<br />\nIn order to have a successful season, the Hopkins<br />\nteam must be in the game all the way. Both Muhlenberg<br />\nand Franklin and Marshall were beaten because of a<br />\ncombined full game effort on the part of both the<br />\noffensive and defensive units. Hopefully the game with<br />\nUrsinus may only prove to be a fluke in a strong football<br />\nseason for Hopkins.

It was in the form of the<br />\nfirst Vietnam Moratorium, and<br />\nBaltimore, including Hopkins, played an<br />\nimportant role.<br />\nPressure, not confrontation, was the<br />\nstrategy of the demonstrators. The local<br />\nMoratorium was conceived not only to<br />\nput pressure on the Nixon<br />\nAdministration, but force the reluctant<br />\nHopkins administrators to express a<br />\nUniversity policy statement on the war.<br />\nWe Will Succeed<br />\n\"It's putting pressure on the<br />\ngovernment and the administration of<br />\nthe school,\" said Larry Goldberg, one of<br />\nthe principal organizers of the anti-war<br />\nactivities at Hopkins. He termed the<br />\nWednesday demonstrations as a<br />\ngrass-roots movement of all Americans,<br />\nnot just students. \"We showed the<br />\ngovernment what the people really<br />\nwant,\" Goldberg asserted. \"The people<br />\nhere are attempting to influence power,<br />\nand they will succeed.\"<br />\nAnd the pressure was impressive.<br />\nHundreds of thousands of Americans of<br />\nall ages and backgrounds peacefully<br />\nprotested against the war in Southeast<br />\nAsia. Downtown Baltimore was flooded<br />\nby (official estimate)<br />\n18,000 people<br />\nattending the two Federal Plaza rallies.<br />\nAt Wednesday's marches and rallies,<br />\na unity of purpose and a tolerance of all<br />\nseemed to pervade Baltimore's autumn<br />\nweather. Although college students<br />\nmade up the predominant group, blacks<br />\nand over-thirty whites also participated<br />\nin significant numbers.<br />\nTenuous Link<br />\nThe link, however, between the<br />\nstudents and their elders is tenuous and<br /><br />\nit is likely to split soon. the young<br />\nradicals in particular, will probably tire<br />\nof the Moratorium's peacful activity in<br />\nthe ensuing months, especially if<br />\nmassive withdrawals of American troops<br />\nare not forthcoming.<br />\nIn Washington the evidence that<br />\nNixon will listen to these protests seems<br />\neven more doubtful this week. On<br />\nSunday, Secretary of State William P.<br />\nRogers cautioned against protests as a<br />\nway to end the war. \"There hasn't been<br />\nany progress in Paris for the last two or<br />\nthree months,\" Rogers stated, \"and I<br />\nwould doubt that there would be any<br />\nprogress unless it is clear that President<br />\nNixon's policy is supported by the<br />\nAmerican people.\"<br /><br />\nplc by lemm<br /><br />\nWhile Rogers tells Americans to<br />\n\"keep the faith\" in the wisdom of the<br />\nNixon Administration, the President is<br />\nnow repeating Johnson's rhetoric that<br />\nSouth Vietnam is the world's pandora's<br />\nbox, and it is our responsibility to<br />\nkeep it closed.<br />\nIn a letter this week to a Georgetown<br />\nstudent protester, Nixon claimed that a<br />\nspeedy withdrawal from South Vietnam<br />\nwould have disacterous consequences<br />\nplc by battis<br /><br />\n\"in both human and international<br />\nterms.\" The President further said that<br />\nthe war involves larger stakes than the<br />\nfate of South Vietnam, and he will not<br />\nsacrifice these stakes to the impatience<br />\nof public opinion.<br />\nYet many people showed on<br />\nWednesday their willingness to protest<br />\nthe war beyond an opinon poll and their<br />\nconviction that they can influence<br />\ngovernment policy. Locally, besides the<br />\nmarches and rallies, about a hundred<br />\ncollege students spent October 15<br />\nleafletting thirteen shopping centers and<br />\nthe downtown business district.<br />\nOn Homewood campus the<br />\nMoratorium Committee and the Student<br />\nCouncil organized a well-attended set of<br />\nactivities. About seven hundred Hopkins<br />\nstudents gathered for the afternoon<br />\nrally in front of Gilman Hall, almost<br />\n7,000 students amassed later in the day<br />\nfor the march downtown and about 250<br />\nprotestors were at the candlelight<br />\nservices Wednesday night.<br />\nOne of the biggest disappointments<br />\nwas the lack of faculty attendance<br />\nduring the Moratorium activities. The<br />\nStudent Council and other students<br />\ntalked to all the professors here about<br />\nMoratorium activities. The Council<br />\nfurthermore picketed classrooms on<br />\nWednesday and put out some anti-war<br /><br />\nplc by hoffmann<br /><br />\nleaflets.<br />\nThe big question for next month<br />\ncenters around the growing possibility<br />\nof violence if the demands for peace are<br />\nnot heeded. President Nixon announced<br />\nlast week that a major policy statement<br />\non Vietnam will be televized to the<br />\nAmerican people on November 3.<br />\nRegardless of Nixon's stand, the<br />\norganizers of the Moritorium plan to<br />\ngain even more support for their<br />\nacitvities among traditionally liberal<br />\norganizations. The United Automobile<br />\nWorkers, the National Teamster Union<br />\nand the chemical workers union already<br />\nhave endorsed the Moratorium concept.<br />\nBut even with more support,<br />\nfrustration should soon appear once the<br />\nexcitement of Wednesday is forgotten.<br />\nJust how far did the people's voice seep<br />\ninto the minds of the massive<br />\nWashington bureaucracy is the question<br />\nmany people are now asking.<br />\nRecently Vice-President Agnew said<br />\nthat patriotism and protest are<br />\nincompatible. This, plus Rogers' and<br />\nNixon's statements on Sunday, seems<br />\nonce again to ask the American people<br />\nfor patience under the banner of<br />\npatriotism. A significant number of<br />\nAmericans. as the Moratorium cogently<br />\nproved, are not about to heed the<br />\ngovernment's wishes.<br /><br />\n'Bullshit and Rhetoric from University<br />\nMr. Bilgrave, who was present at the<br />\nteach-in when the band began to play,<br />\nwould not comment on whether the<br />\nband was in fact \"disruptive.\"<br />\nThe \"extra-curricular suspension\"<br />\nwas, in the words of Jim Archibald,<br />\n\"The worst thing they could have done;<br />\nthe November Moratorium is coming up<br />\nin four weeks and we've lost our<br />\nprincipal organizer for two of them.\"<br />\nGoldberg, a Moratorium organizer,<br />\nexplained that the suspension meant<br />\nthat he could not hold or attend any<br />\nmeeting, do any work at the SA office,<br />\nbut that he could talk to individuals<br />\nabout the Moratorium.<br />\nArchibald talked about University<br />\n'neutrality, in the light of its actions<br />\nconcerning the Moratorium, \"First they<br />\nwon't let us talk to those going to class<br />\non the 15th inside the buildings, then<br />\nthe Rumberger directive, and finally<br />\nthese suspensions.

Not<br />\nsurprisingly amid the forest of security<br /><br />\nWiM\n<br />\nJohn and I were shown a wide array<br />\nof tasks that were for the most part<br />\nnon-military. We got to \"talk\" with one<br />\nof the lab's thirty-five satellites, the one<br />\nthat took the first color photograph<br />\never made of the earth. The 3D X-ray<br />\nprojector and the nerve controlled<br />\nartificial limbs were fascinating, but<br />\nthere was the feeling that we had been<br />\nsteered clear of an' controversial<br />\nmilitary research, perhaps for security<br />\nreasons.<br />\nDr. Ellis did show us the GSEL<br />\nanti-missile fleet defense system work<br />\nand display models of the Terrier,<br />\nTartan and Tabs missiles. These were all<br />\nfleet defense systems, but APL only<br />\ndeveloped the latter three missiles. The<br />\nwork on the GSEL project involves<br />\ncomputer simulation testing of the<br />\nguidance and intercept mechanisms.<br />\nSeveral of the missile projects were<br />\nor are still classified, but it is the<br />\noverwhelming sentiment at the lab that<br />\nthese weapons were for defensive not<br />\noffensive deployment.

To say that it is<br />\nor to say that it is not scientifically truthful<br />\nis to attack the integrity of a large number<br />\nof excellent and dedicated and moral<br />\nscientists, many of whom I know<br />\npersonally.

This week, the members of the Black Students Union at<br />\nHomewood informed us that they believe they are being made an issue of,<br />\nand not treated as individual human beings.<br />\nIf that is the result of the coverage of the News-Letter, we extend our<br />\napologies. However, the members of the B.S.U. also stated that we should<br />\nkeep out of their affairs (the atmosphere at Homewood for blacks, black<br />\nadmissions, etc.), and not try to help out where we are neither needed nor<br />\nwanted. They took exception to the editorial of last week calling for<br />\nincreased black admissions, saying that the editors, as white men, could<br />\nnot understand the torment of a black man at Hopkins and had best just<br />\nstay out of the entire issue.<br />\nIt is true that we cannot understand what a black man goes through at<br />\nHopkins. As whites, we cannot hope to fully understand what the blacks<br />\nneed or how they feel. However, the fact that a man is white is not<br />\ngrounds for discounting his opinion on issues such as these. The question<br />\nof black admissions relates to both whites and blacks at Homewood. We<br />\nsee no reason to \"keep our nose out of it.\"<br />\nThe Black Student Union stated that News-Letter had slighted black<br />\nstudents and made them seem inferior in the articles. This is simply not<br />\ntrue. We realize that in writing anything about questions of black and<br />\nWhite that we were dealing with a volatile issue. We made every attempt<br />\nnot to lean toward either side in an article such as the Jensen Report or<br />\nthat on black admissions.<br />\nFinally, throughout the discussion, people seemed to be attributing<br />\nmotives to the reporters involved. The allegations made were based on the<br />\nPremise that the reporters were trying to promote one or another point of<br />\nview within their news stories. This is also untrue. The fact that an article<br />\nappears concerning black students says nothing about the reporter's or<br />\nnewspaper's attitude concerning that question. Within the body of the<br />\nstory, every effort is made to rule out personal attitudes.<br />\nThe black students doubtless have a point when they claim that they<br />\nare regarded too much as an issue and not enough as people. However, the<br />\nfact that they do not enjoy seeing articles about blacks in the News-Letter<br />\nand that they may disagree with the editorial policy of the paper cannot<br />\nkeep the stories out of print.<br /><br />\nSenate Si, S.C. No<br />\nThe Student Council did a dismal job in appointing students to serve<br />\non the various policy making committees at Homewood. The fact that<br />\nPositions were open was ill publicized.

It seems, in fact that some of the<br />\npositions were filled before the interviewing started. Council members<br />\nseemed to have a definite idea of whom they wanted as representatives,<br />\nregardless of how the interviewing progressed.<br />\nHowever, the fact that the Council's procedure on this matter was<br />\nirregular and not conducive to choosing good representatives is tangential.<br />\nWhat is central to the question of students gaining any power at Hopkins<br />\nis whether the concept of chosen representatives can ever work at all. The<br />\nCouncil's bad form in selecting representatives as a symptom of the<br />\nprocess' futility.<br />\nLast year, students were angered that Dean Swanson had chosen<br />\nrepresentatives for the student body without consulting any students.<br />\nNow it seems that the Council has turned around and done the same<br />\nthing. When it comes doen to choosing, representatives, it dawns on people<br />\nthat it isn't very important. No one is going to adequately represent<br />\nstudent opinion, and there is little advantage to be gained by choosing one<br />\nstudent over another.<br />\nWhat this episode in the Council's speckled history proves is that<br />\nrepresentation is not functional and can not be functional even when the<br />\nCouncil(the elected \"voice of the students\") has the opportunity to select<br />\nthe student committee members.<br />\nThis entire problem should be neatly avoided with the creation of the<br />\nuniversity senate. The senate would be an elected body with enough<br />\nmembers and divergent opinions to adequately express the views of the<br />\nstudents. We hope that when it is created, the Student Council and its<br />\ncounterparts in ineptness will be effectively sidestepped in the decision<br />\nmaking process.<br /><br />\ncANT<br />\nepr<br />\nMAW 1j CARroNs<br /><br />\n50 THAIS<br /><br />\nPublishera-lfall Syndicate<br /><br />\nAINNIIIIM111111\u2022011\u20221\u202211,<br /><br />\n111.1\u2022111111INI.<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n10-12<br /><br />\nPAGE 8<br /><br />\nN[WS-L NTT E R<br /><br />\nOct. 17, 1969<br /><br />\nfeatures<br />\n\"Abbey Road\" One Way --Wrong<br />\nBy PRINCE NAMOR<br />\nSix years, do you believe it? Of course not. But it has<br />\nbeen six years since the Beatles leaped to international<br />\npopularity. Beatlemania, the Ed Sullivan Show, 45 songs<br />\nin the Top 40, \"She Loves You\" number one for a<br />\nthousand weeks in a row, twist and shout at junior high<br />\ndances.<br />\nAnd now Abbey Road at the end of six years. A<br />\ntypical Beatle album, a very Beatle album. But if it were<br />\nreleased six years ago, in 1963, it would be very hard to<br />\ndistinguish it from Beatle music of that time period.<br />\nThis is not to deny the \"top pop mop tops\"(a Time<br />\nmagazine phrase) their prominent place in the history of<br />\npopular music. Their lightning advent had enormous<br />\nimpact and almost suffocating influence, to the point<br />\nthat Time and Life hired every pseudo<br />\npsycho-sociologist to explain the \"phenomenon.\" The<br />\nadvances of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band<br />\ncannot be forgotten.<br />\nSimple Tunes<br />\nAfter Sergeant Pepper the Beatles abandoned their<br />\nposition in the vanguard of rock music. They stopped<br />\nbeing revolutionary, stopped being concerned about<br />\n\"new directions.\" Just sat around, counting their<br />\nmoney, watching the rain, and picking out a few simple<br />\ntunes. Ending up with Abbey Road. Their last album,<br />\na two-record set called The Beatles, was an unqualified<br />\ndisaster. They seem to have recovered somewhat with<br />\ntheir latest release. Some simple melodies, some pleasant<br />\nrock. Not much, but that is what the Beatles are doing.<br />\nThe talent of the Beatles has always been in the creation<br />\nof enjoyable, interesting tunes, something to sing along<br />\nwith like \"Hey Jude\" or \"Get Back\". Their musical<br />\ntalents have developed little since Introducing the<br />\nBeatles, their first album. McCartney is an excellent bass<br />\nplayer. But if Harrison were to appear before audiences<br />\nfamiliar with Clapton and Bloomfield, he would not last<br />\nvery long. The same may be said about Lennon and Star.<br />\nHillbilly Trash<br />\nSo the quartet just lounges in a recording studio,<br />\nplaying some nice ditties. Sixteen tunes, with some<br />\nblues, some folk, some country, some Broadway, but all<br />\nessentially rock. The lyrics, once something the<br /><br />\nadolescent fan could point to with pride (\"Look Mom,<br />\nsee, I'm not wasting my money on hillbilly trash\") are<br />\nnow of very inconsistent quality, ranging from the<br />\nmore-than-acceptable to the insulting (my God, \"I blew<br />\nmy mind\"; even Business Week has ceased using that<br />\nphrase.)<br />\nThe songs: one of the best is \"Come Together\", the<br />\nfirst cut on the album. Written by John Lennon, it<br />\nfeatures a jazzy arrangement, some interesting drum<br />\nwork, and very Lennonesque \"I Am the Walrus\" lyrics<br />\n(\"he shoots Coca-Cola\"? Okay, if it works.)<br />\nNext comes \"Something\", which, along with \"Here<br />\nConies the Sun\", are George Harrison's compositional<br />\ncontricutions to Abbey Road. Both are embarrassingly<br />\nsimple, annoyingly syrupy, and ultimately soporific.<br />\nRemember in 1964 when Harrison would moan \"Do you<br />\nwant to know a secret?\" and you would yell \"no\" and<br />\nswitch the radio dial. Well, his musical imagination has<br />\nchanged little since.<br />\nIn the Still of the Night<br />\nThe Beatles' predilection for song parody continues<br />\ndown memory lane with \"Oh! Darling\", a McCartney<br />\nsong. It is an almost perfect recapturing of the musical<br />\nstyle of the late 1950's, when people listened to the<br />\nFlamingoes, the Platters, and Lee Andrews and the<br />\nHearts. McCartney's shouting is magnificient, the<br />\nooh-ooh-aah chorus fits in, the echo chamber effect<br />\nworks. Unfortunately, the intrumental accompaniment<br />\nis too complex and involved for the late 50's style.<br />\nNext comes \"Octupus's Garden\", a song which Ringo<br />\nwrote and sang. It is in the cuddly-cute mold of \"Yellow<br />\nSubmarine\", with childish \"Good Ship Lollipop\" lyrics<br />\nabout escaping to an underwater paradise. I am<br />\nconvinced that the cute but stupid Ringo we all think of<br />\nis part of the greatest and most elaborately executed<br />\nput-on in Western culture, that he is actually an<br />\narticulate genius and sage with a 200+ IQ and an<br />\ninfinitely creative imagination. Just wait. You'll see.<br />\n\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" is a Lennon song,<br />\nwith Lennon singing and playing lead guitar. A slow and<br />\nuneventful blues song that seems interminable. But the<br />\ninstrumental break does remind me of the long-gone<br />\ndays when the instrumental was always an obvious<br />\nvariation of the basic melody of the song itself.<br /><br />\nSide two of Abbey Road geatures an eight song<br />\nfifteen minute medle . Basically it is all rock, good rock,<br />\nnever being worse than listenable. As a medley the songs<br />\ndo not fit together successfully; the repetition of \"You<br />\nNever Give Me Your Money\" at the end is not enough to<br />\nunify the whole piece. Also, I must complain that<br />\n\"Polythene Pam\" is too short.<br />\nAlas, dear friends, one can become readily tired of<br />\nlistening to Abbey Road. But there is a new Beatles<br />\nalbum, called Get Back, to be released in early January.<br />\ncontaining eleven songs, a photo book of the recording<br />\nsession and a film of that session. The new album, which<br />\nwas completed before Abbey Road was even begun, is<br />\nintended to be a retrogression to the Beatles of six years<br />\nago, the handsome young idols who didn't take dope or<br />\ncomment on the unpopularity of Jeasus. I don't think<br />\nthere will be much difference between Abbey Road and<br />\nGet Back.<br /><br />\nLudwig von Beethoven, if he were alive today, would<br />\nprobably dislike the Beatles new album, Abbey Road.<br /><br />\nWill the Real Nixon Please Sit Down<br />\nBy MARK AMSLER<br />\nRichard Nixon knows the value of television in<br />\npolitics. After John Kennedy won the 1960 presidential<br />\nelection, Marshall McLuhan commented, \"Without TV,<br />\nNixon had it made.\" Television as a medium was more<br />\nreceptive to the nonchalant, easy flowing attitude which<br />\nKennedy projected then it was to Nixon's cold<br />\naloofness. And Kennedy won.<br />\nSo the decision to run in 1968 was a difficult one for<br />\nNixon's ego to make. He had been hurt by the television<br />\ngame and he knew it. It was just some dirty Eastern<br />\nliberal trick to defeat him and it had worked. And so he<br />\nhad retired bitterly to the safety of Wall Street to nurse<br />\nhis wounds and bide his time. Now, in 1968 he would be<br />\nready for them. He would play their game.<br />\nIn a preliminary advisory meeting with his staff just<br />\nafter he had won the Republican nomination for<br />\nPresident, Nixon said, \"We're going to build this whole<br />\ncampaign around television. You fellows just tell me<br />\nwhat you want me to do and I'll do it.\" The job was to<br />\nsell Richard Nixon as the most likely candidate for<br />\nPresident of the United States.<br />\nHuman Nature<br />\nJoe McGinniss, author of The Selling of the President<br />\n1968, wondered if indeed a presidential candidate could<br />\nbe packaged and sold like a used car. To find out,<br />\nMcGinniss \"joined\" the Nixon campaign staff and spent<br />\nmost of his time traveling with the writers, technicians,<br />\nspecialists, and pollsters who put together the image of a<br />\nman. \"That there is a difference between the individual<br />\nald his image,\" writes the author, \"is human nature. Or<br />\nAmerican nature, at least. That the difference is<br />\nexaggerated and exploited electronically is the reason for<br />\nthis book.\"<br />\nThe difference between a man and his image,<br />\n\"exaggerated and exploited\", is also the substance of<br />\nMcGinniss' book. One doesn't read this book to find out<br />\nabout Richard Nixon. Instead, the reader learns a great<br />\ndeal about the American advertising industry and its<br />\ntremendous power over the minds of the American<br />\npeople. Advertising is a complete subject which is able to<br /><br />\nshape opinions with the minutest of details. In a taping<br />\nsession for one of Nixon's short campaign<br />\n\"commercials\", there was great concern over how to<br />\nbring out the backdrop of shuttered windows and two<br />\nsets of bookcases.<br />\nThe purpose of these items was to project not only a<br />\nphysical but a psychological lightness as well during the<br />\ncandidate's speech. Makeup, it seems, was not the only<br />\nreason Nixon lost in 1960. And in 1968 there were<br />\nplenty of specialists on hand to project the right image<br />\nof Nixon as a worthwhile presidential candidate. Nixon<br />\nlost in 1960 because he was too few of the things a<br />\nPresident should be and there was no one to lie for him.<br />\nIn 1968 there was a whole advertising staff ready to<br />\nbuild him a proper image.<br />\nSyrupy Style<br />\n\"Politics,\" says McGinniss, \"has always been a con<br />\ngame.\" When Eisenhower ran for reelection in 1956. the<br />\nagency of Batton, Barton, Durstine, and Osburn<br />\naccepted his campaign as a regular account. The previous<br />\nfour years they had been on the EisenhoWer payroll.<br />\nLeonard Hall, then national Republican chairman,<br />\nexplained the firm's purpose: \"You sell your candidate<br />\nand your programs the way a business sells its products.\"<br />\nThe situation has not changed much in twelve years.<br />\nKennedy hired an advertising firm for his campaign and<br />\nwas surrounded by men who were specialists in the art<br />\nimage building. Johnson suffered from television<br />\nexposure because or his thick, syrupy style which had<br />\nworked so well in the closed office meetings in the<br />\nSenate. Hubert Humphrey was hurt by television since<br />\nthe medium could not fully cooperate with his<br />\n\"excesses\", his ramblings and indirectiveness.<br />\nTelevision demands a free moving, witty, nonchalant<br />\napproach, one with smooth elegance, such as the<br />\nqualities found in Eugene McCarthy. These are not<br />\nqualities which necessarily make a good president. In<br />\nfact, they are not even political judgements. They have<br />\nnothing to do with a man's ability in office. They are<br />\nmerely those qualities which are the best suited for<br />\npresentation over television. And they are the qualities<br /><br />\nwhich Nixon sought to project to the American people.<br />\nCat Named Shakespeare<br />\nThe people who gave Nixon an image acceptable to<br />\nthe people were professionals. Gene Jones, one of the<br />\nplanners and directors of Nixon's television campaign.<br />\nput it bluntly: \"I'm a professional. This is a professional<br />\njob. I was neutral toward Nixon when I started. Now I<br />\nhappen to be for him. But that's not the point. The<br />\npoint is, for the money. I'd do it for almost anybody.\"<br />\nMasterminds of the Nixon image-Harry Treleaven and<br />\nFrank Shakespeare (with an aid named Shakespeare<br />\nyour material can't be all bad)--issued memoranda and<br />\nnotes which described to the detail what was required to<br />\nput Nixon over to the people through television.<br />\nThey circulated extracts from McLuhan's<br />\nUnderstanding Media to the members of Nixon's staff.<br />\nThey noted which side of the candidate's face was best<br />\nsuited to what particular viewpoint and attitude. They<br />\nmade sure that Nixon spoke in a voice geared to the<br />\naudience he was addressing. The minuteness of their<br />\nwork is summed up in this from a memorandum sent by<br />\nRoger Ailes, studio director of Nixon's first half hour<br />\ntalk program to the nation: When film is not available it<br />\nmight be good to have David Douglas Duncan shoot a<br />\nseries of interesting stills which could be put on film and<br />\nsynchronized to the Connie Francis record.<br />\nNot A Showman<br />\nMcGinniss' book is timely and must reading for<br />\nunderstanding a very important, if not the most<br />\nimportant. aspect of American society\u2014advertising\u2014and<br />\nhow it affects the race for the highest position in thy<br />\nland. McGinniss spares no phrases and carries the reader<br />\nthrough all of his thinking while accompanying the<br />\nNixon train during its mpve for the presidency: the<br />\ntimes of praise and doubt, of comptehension and lack of<br />\nunderstanding. of objective ad subjective analysis. And<br />\nin the end we have Richard Nixon telling America on the<br />\nnight of his election: \"I'm not a showman.

Having been nominated for<br />\nPresident, he must commence a<br />\ncampaign that will lead to the White<br />\nHouse, to obscurity, or possibly to<br />\nboth. Fortunately, in 1904, a candidate<br />\nrequired no imagination to start his<br />\ncampaign. All campaigns commenced in<br />\nan authentic American folk ritual<br />\ngenerically known as the Notification of<br />\nAcceptance.<br />\nThe idea of the ceremony was that<br />\nthe National Convention would appoint<br />\na delegation to go to the candidate's<br />\ndomicile. The chairman of the<br />\ndelegation would inform the candidate<br />\nof his nomination, and the candidate<br />\nwould respond with his speech of<br />\nacceptance. Long years ago, there was a<br />\nnecessity to inform candidates of their<br />\nnominations. Zachary Taylor, for<br />\ninstance, did not know of his<br />\nnomination until the news was mailed<br />\nto him. By 1904 there was no<br />\neducational function in the notification,<br />\nand the purpose of the ceremony was to<br />\nprovide a lavishly publicized forum for a<br />\ncandidate's first campaign speech.<br />\nOne should not think that the<br />\ngenerations who had to suffer through<br />\nthem accepted the notification<br />\nceremonies with entire seriousness.<br />\nThere were quadrennial parodies of<br />\nnotifications. One of the best, as well as<br />\none of the most easily accessible, is a<br />\nPiece by the pseudonymous Artemas<br />\nWard entitled \"How Old Abe Received<br />\nThe News of His Nomination.\"<br /><br />\nOne point of interest in the 1904<br />\nDemocratic ceremonies is that nature<br />\nexceeded art. -A common characteristic<br />\nof the parodies was to mock the<br />\ncandidates' choosing to be nominated in<br />\nwholesome small towns. No one could<br />\nhave parodied the choice of towns when<br />\nParker received his notification in<br />\nEsopus, New York arid running mate<br />\nDavis chose to be notified in White<br />\nSulphur Springs, West Virginia.<br />\nThe Parker notification occurred<br />\nnear the extensive parker estate in<br />\nEsopus on August 10. A rising young<br />\nDemocrat, Representative Champ Clark<br />\nof Missouri, had the privilege of<br />\ndelivering the notification speech as<br />\nChairman of the Notification<br />\nCommittee. Clark's speech was of the<br />\ngeneric type known as Presidential<br />\nNotification Addresses, and it was<br />\nneither conspicuously better nor<br />\nconspicuously worse than all but a few<br />\nof the others.<br />\nClark extolled party regularity as<br />\noffering the best avenue of service to<br />\nthe nation, observed that American<br />\nfavored \"reverence for the Constitution<br />\nand obedience to law,\" characterized<br />\nthe recent Democratic Convention as<br />\nsplendid in its freedom of discourse and<br />\nnoted that the Convention advocated<br />\n\"restoring the government to the<br />\nprinciples advocated by the fathers.<br />\n\"The fathers of whom Mr. Clark was<br />\nspeaking were not in attendance to<br />\ngainsay him, so it must have been<br />\nassumed by Clark's auditors that Parker<br />\nhad the support of people like Jefferson<br />\nand Madison.<br /><br />\nThis is your last chance...<br />\nWould You Like to Start Your Own Library of<br />\nObscure Historical Works?

He condemned the<br />\nadministration for fostering trusts, but<br />\nforeclosed the possibility of corrective<br />\nlegislation, saying the trusts could be<br />\ndealt with through \"common law.\" He<br />\ncondemned the high rates of the<br />\nDingley Tariff, but suggested that<br />\nbusiness would require time to adjust to<br />\na tariff revision, and also that change<br />\nwould be very difficult to achieve until<br />\nboth houses of Congress and the<br />\nPresident concurred on the need for<br />\nrevision. This last point may appear a<br />\nsimple truism, but as it was<br />\nmathematically extremely difficult for<br />\nthe Democrats to gain control of the<br />\nSenate in 1904, Parker was indicating<br />\nthat there would be revision only at an<br />\nindeterminate point in the future.<br />\nParker's position on foreign affairs<br />\nseemed a considerable softening of the<br />\nstridency of Bryan's 1900 campaign<br />\nagainst colonialism. Parker said he<br />\nwould give \"self-government\" to the<br />\nPhilippines \"as soon as they are<br />\nreasonably prepared for it.\" Again,<br />\naction is promised, but only at an<br />\nindeterminate period in the future, after<br />\npresent conditions have gradually<br />\nchanged. Parker obviously lacked an<br />\nactivist view of executive authority, and<br />\nhe had no ambition to show<br />\naccomplishment in a short period of<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe declaration on the Philippines<br />\nwas a particular source of criticism and<br />\ncharges of ambivalence. Parker made a<br />\nsemantic quarrel inevitable when he<br />\npledged, sometime, \"self-government\"<br />\ndid not preclude some form of<br />\nassociation or even federation with the<br />\nUnited States, it was suggested that<br />\nParker did not differ from the<br />\nRepublican position on how to govern<br />\nthe Philippines.<br />\nParker had sufficient consciousness<br />\nof these criticisms to write a clarifying<br />\nacceptance letter to the notification<br />\ncommittee. Acceptance letters had been<br />\ntraditional in thy days before<br />\nnotification ceremonies. They have been<br />\nmuch shorter than the ambitious missive<br />\nin which Parker sought to establish his<br />\nown consistency and meanwhile seize<br />\nthe offensive against Roosevelt.<br />\nThere followed Parker, who<br />\nexceeded Jefferson in ability to project<br />\nhis voice; and while he did not exceed<br />\nJefferson in much else, this latter talent<br />\nwas his greatest need in the ceremony at<br /><br />\nEsopus. Parker's first campaign speech<br />\ncontained no basic surprises, but a stress<br />\non his own conservatism in contrast to<br />\nthe alleged impetuousity of President<br />\nRoosevelt. Parker observed that the<br />\nspirit of the Democratic platform<br />\n\"assures conservative instead of rash<br />\naction.\" He drew a distinction between<br />\n\"constitutionalism,\" which he<br />\npromised, and \"imperialism.\" The latter<br />\nterm refers not to foreign policy, but<br />\ncontains the suggestion that President<br />\nRoosevelt sought powers befitting an<br />\nemperor.<br />\nVery little was actually clarified.<br />\nParker explained that when he said<br />\n\"self-government\" he meant<br />\n\"independence,\" but he still had<br />\nnothing to say as to when independence<br />\ncould reasonably be expected. He also<br />\nsaid that he had not meant to say that<br />\ntariff reform awaited the election of a<br />\nDemocratic Senate. He said that he<br />\nwould expect the support of the<br />\nRepublican revisionists in Congress, and<br />\nthat in any event the Congress would<br />\nrespect his election to the Presidency as<br />\na mandate for tariff reform.<br />\nIt is always embarrassing for a<br />\ncandidate to have to rephrase his<br />\npositions. Parker attempted to scald<br />\nRoosevelt, but apparently his<br />\ndisagreements with the President were<br />\nlimited to legal niceities. Thus, Parker<br />\nsaid that it might be a source of regret<br />\nthat Roosevelt had obtained the Panama<br />\nCanal in an aggressive manner. However,<br />\nhe accepted the action and pledged to<br />\nbuild the Canal as fast as possible.<br />\nParker also criticized the President<br />\nfor extending the scope of veterans'<br />\npensions by declaration, asserting that<br />\nthis power was vested in Congress.<br />\nParker's suggested remedy was to revoke<br />\nthe Presidential order while persuading<br />\nCongress to extend pensions as<br />\nRoosevelt had provided. This matter<br />\nmay have been momentous to Parker,<br />\nbut the veterans could only be expected<br />\nto prefer Roosevelt's direct approach to<br />\nthe same end.<br />\nThe Parker documents indicate a<br />\ncandidate devoted to conservatism who<br />\nwas nevertheless at pains to assure the<br />\npeople that they would retain the gains<br />\nsecured by the dynamic approach of<br />\nRoosevelt. He merely promised to make<br />\neverything more economical. At this<br />\npoint Parker was sounding an uncertain<br />\ntrumpet. As the campaign proceeds, it<br />\nwill be determined that Parker never did<br />\ndiscover an overall, consistent, magnetic<br />\nplan of attack.<br /><br />\nHopkins Theatre:A Star Isn't Born<br />\nBy ROBIN J. HOLT<br />\nOne of the eternal pleasures of the theatre is being<br />\nfooled. Here we are at the opening of another<br />\nBarnstormer season and astonishing expectations<br />\nalternate with dismal disappointments.<br />\nThe Barnstormer powers that are chose to open this<br />\nseason with \"3x3\", a program of freshmen one-acters.<br />\nPutting freshmen on stage is always a gamble, and the<br />\ndirectors reminded me of that redundantly Friday night.<br />\nThe plays were The Man with the Flower in His Mouth<br />\nby Luigi Pirandello, directed by Stuart Wattles; and in<br />\nthe Pirandello tradition, The Ugly Duckling by A.A.<br />\nMilne, directed by John Sadowsky; and in the Milne<br />\ntraditon, Don Juan in Hell by G.B. Shaw, directed by<br />\nJack McClung. Well, two outa three ain't bad.<br />\nUnexpected Cliches<br />\nThe Pirandello play was remarkably similar to Albee's<br />\nThe Zoo Story, in which director Wattles played last<br />\nspring. The faithful actor does not seem to have<br />\nforgotten learned lessons. The \"flower\" of the play is a<br />\nmailgnant tumor growing on the lip of a blunt Albee-like<br />\na character who tries to shake a slow-witted and<br />\ncomplacent commuter into facing the nature of death.<br />\nIt is difficult play composed of extended philosophic<br />\nmonologues which have to be underplayed. In short, it is<br />\na play requiring the utmost in subtle disciplined<br />\nacting\u2014clearly not for unskilled freshmen.<br /><br />\nThe Ugly Duckling is an almost impossible play to<br />\nruin. Milne's satire on the royal court fairy tale runs<br />\nthick with all of the unexpected cliches about a king and<br />\nqueen attempting to marry off a less-than-beautiful<br />\nprincess. After twenty exquisitely painful minutes with<br />\nLuigi P., Milne was a delightful respite.<br />\nWatch the Original<br />\nAlmost without exception Director Sadowsky's cast<br />\nmeshed into a charming whole. Particularly deserving of<br />\nmention were David Williams' king (subtle and polished,)<br />\nand Janet Fenton, who played the uncouth serving maid<br />\nof Dulcibella the Princess (to take trite comic tricks and<br />\nbreathe life into them anew is the mark of a genius.) Of<br />\nthe remaining actors, Ralph Hoctor's Chancellor was<br />\nadequate, Anne Silbey's queen less-than (if I want Carol<br />\nBurnett, I'll watch the original, please,) Judy Greenlee's<br />\nCamilla the Princess was altogether a lovely stage<br />\npicture, Mark Barth's Prince Simon, well, Mark, go back<br />\nto high school, and Gregory Fosler's Carlo, a wordless<br />\nmasterpiece.<br />\nThe last play on the bill was approached by this<br />\nreviewer with some quailing of the aesthetic liver. Don<br />\nJuan is the quintessence of Shaw, the witty and complex<br />\ndroppings of a genius entranced with the sound of his<br />\nown voice. Unaware that Sir Cedric Hardwicke had<br />\nenrolled as a freshman, I was not sure what to expect.<br />\nHe hadn't.<br /><br />\nNevertheless, Christopher Beach's Don Jua was a<br />\nmatchless fit in form and voice. I doubt that better<br />\nDon Juan could have been found, unlearned lin( or no.<br />\nAdrienne Wienberger's Ana, the pious Christian I arrified<br />\nat being in hell, did full justice to a favorite Shavian<br />\ntarget. James Johnson's Statue, Ana's bored lather in<br />\nheaven, was equally aware of Shaw's pc int. The faggot<br />\ndevil, played by Hans Fecho, was something of a shock<br />\nin Shaw, but it came off, and I am the last on to argue<br />\nwith things off.<br />\nDirector McClung assembled a fine cast, r.:rhaps the<br />\nfinest of the evening. Nevertheless, another third of<br />\nShaw could have been easily blue-penciled, for unless<br />\nyou do happen to be Sir Cedric, keeping on Juan alive<br />\nfor an hour can be an impossible task.<br />\nRarely has this reviewer seen a set as skillfully and<br />\nversatileyly used as Allen 1 rumpler's white flats<br />\nemployed in all three shows. And it warms this<br />\nreviewer's pen to see a set designer and a lighting<br />\ndesigner each know what he other is doing and work<br />\nharmoniously.<br />\nNow that the season has opened, it will be valuable to<br />\nwork on other student-directed productions.

My<br />\nprofessional specialties include the<br />\nprediction of academic achievement,<br />\nand I have done research in that area for<br />\nmany years. My findings and point of<br />\nview are congruent with those of other<br />\nmeasurement specialists such as Lloyd<br />\nG. Humphreys of the University of<br />\nIllinois (see his letter in Science, 10<br />\nOctober 1969, p. 167).<br />\nMr. Reutter tried hard to present<br />\nseveral points of view. I fear, however,<br />\nthat the typical reader may conclude<br />\nthat Hopkins offers admission each year<br />\nto few (or even no) black applicants,<br />\nwhen in fact if all accepted black<br />\napplicants actually came to Hopkins<br />\nrather than going elsewhere the<br />\nfreshman class would have more than<br />\n10% blacks in it. Even with severe<br />\ncompetition from the Ivy League and<br />\nelsewhere, about 3% of our freshmen<br />\nare black. I feel sure that Director of<br />\nAdmissions William Brinkley would be<br />\nglad to prepare a detailed report on<br />\nblack applicants and black enrollees for<br />\nthe News-Letter, if asked to do so.<br />\nA few other comments might be<br />\nclarifying. I emphasized to Mr. Reutter<br />\nthat tutoring, remedial courses, and<br />\ncoaching have not been found effective<br />\nenough to bridge much of a gap<br />\nbetween academically severely<br />\nunderqualified freshmen and at least<br />\nmininzally qualified freshmen. For<br />\nexample, ti ere is published evidence<br />\nfrom the directors of comprehensive<br />\nprograms at Berkeley and Michigan<br />\nState that their success was not, to put<br />\nit mildly, spectacular.<br />\nMost of the thirteen students Mr.<br />\nCotter wanted accepted en masse were<br />\nvastly below Hopkins usual minimum<br />\nadmission requirements which respect<br />\nto test scores and high-school grades.<br />\nMr. Cotter's statements on page 16<br />\n\"that only one of the five students who<br />\nCAN YOU USE SOME<br />\nEXTRA BREAD?<br /><br />\ntook the SAT scored below 300\" and<br />\nthat \"one student received scores 657<br />\nverbal and 591 math ...\" are misleading<br />\nbecause most of the SAT scores were far<br />\nbelow Hopkins' lowest-scoring normally<br />\nadmitted freshmen, and the 657 and<br />\n591 were not earned by a black student.<br />\nThe average SAT-Verbal score of entering<br />\nfreshmen at Hopkins is about 640-650,<br />\nand only 3% of its students (including<br />\nspecially admitted ones) score below<br />\n500. According to S.A. Kendrick,<br />\nwriting in the College Board Review,<br />\nonly one or two percent of all black<br />\nhigh-school seniors score above 500 on<br />\nSAT-V.<br />\nCorn plicati ng the low-test-score<br />\nproblem, however, are the generally low<br />\ngradepoint averages earned in many<br />\ninner-city high schools. For example, in<br />\nhis College Board Revies report on his<br />\nspecial program at Michigan State Vice<br />\nPresident Sabine noted that only 3% of<br />\nsophomores and juniors in Detroit high<br />\nschools had a \"B\" average or better. To<br />\nsucceed academically at Hopkins an<br />\nentering student needs at least<br />\nupper-20% ability on College Board<br />\ntests and demonstrated ability to earn<br />\ngood grades. Most colleges and<br />\nuniversities do not have curricula as<br />\ndemanding as Hopkins, so the applicant<br />\nwho is quite underqualified<br />\nacademically for Hopkins may succeed<br />\nelsewhere. In my open letter I urge that<br />\nhe be helped to attentd a college more<br />\ncongruent with his developed academic<br />\nabilities, rather than embarking on a<br />\nlong, expensive attempt to make<br />\nHopkins into a partly open-door<br />\ncommunity college. Quite likely<br />\nBaltimore does need such an institution,<br />\nbecause the Community College of<br />\nBaltimore does not seem open\u2014door in<br />\nthe same sense that the California junior<br />\ncolleges are, but neither historically nor<br />\nin terms of its present limited<br />\nspecialized resources is Hopkins able to<br />\ntake on that role effectively.<br />\nPresumably, Mr. Cotter wants to force<br />\nHopkins to change in that direction in<br />\nCCNY fashion, but much such change<br />\nwould probably spell the end of<br />\nHopkins as the top-level institution it<br />\nhas been since 1876. 1 predict that it<br />\nwould quickly become neither a fine<br />\nopen-door community college nor a<br />\nplace where exceptionally able males of<br />\nvarious backgrounds would thrive, a fate<br /><br />\nthat seems inevitable for CCNY.<br />\nProbably the strongest evidence that<br />\nMr. Cotter's proposal was not in the<br />\nbest interests of the twelve black<br />\nstudents themselves is his failure to<br />\nconvince Assistant Director of<br />\nAdmissions Ronald Owens that they were<br />\nnot being used as pawns in a power play<br />\nagainst the University. Mr. Owens,<br />\nperhaps more than anyone else on<br />\ncampus, has the ultimate welfare of<br />\nsuch students paramount in his<br />\nthinking.<br />\nTwo technical points may be worth<br />\nexamining. Firstly, how many<br />\nHopkins-level black male high-school<br />\ngraduates become available each year? A<br />\nfew rough calculations will quickly give<br />\nus an approximate figure. If 3,500,000<br />\nbabies are born in the United States<br />\nduring a given year, 6% of them are<br />\nblack males, half of those black males<br />\ngraduate from high school, 2% of those<br />\ngraduates score 500 or more on SAT-V,<br />\nand half of those have high\u2014enough<br />\ngrades, we find the number to be 1,050.<br />\nCompare that figure with the 3,000 for<br />\nboth sexes in my open letter (black<br />\nwomen seem academically abler, on the<br />\naverage, than black men, and more<br />\npersistent and successful in school). The<br />\nfigure of 33,000 at the close of Mr.<br />\nReutter's article seems greatly inflated;<br />\neven 3,500,000x12%x2% is only 8,400.<br />\nHe seems to have reported about four<br />\ntimes that\u2014the total number of<br />\nfairly-high-test-score blacks of both<br />\nsexes in all four years of high school?<br />\nEven then, one must make allowance<br />\nfor non-graduation from secondary<br />\nschool.<br />\nFinally, the classified ad was good<br />\nfun, but the average Hopkins freshman<br />\ndoes not have an IQ of 140 or SAT-V<br />\nplus SAT-M score of 1500, nor (if he is<br />\nblack) does he need his \"own financial<br />\nresources.\" As noted above, one can get<br />\ninto Hopkins in some curricula with an<br />\nSAT total of 1000 or even less, and the<br />\nIQ of the typical SAT-V 500 student is<br />\nprobably less than 120. The IQ<br />\ncorresponding to an SAT-V score of 650<br />\nis probably less than 135; slightly more<br />\nthan half of Hopkins freshmen are<br />\nbelow that. By comparison, the average<br />\nrecipient of a Ph.D. degree in biological<br />\nor physical science in the United States<br />\nhas an IQ of about 130.<br />\nIt would seem that the editors of the<br /><br />\nFUN WORKING IN EUROPE<br /><br />\nEd. note\u2014As reported in the September<br />\n26, 1969 issue of the N-L, 37 blacks<br />\nwere accepted to Hopkins last year out<br />\nof approximately 1,000 students<br />\nadmitted, or 3.7 per cent of the class<br />\nwas black. Of the 540 students who<br />\nentered the freshman class, 14 were<br />\nblack, or 2.6 per cent. Even if all the<br />\nblacks accepted to Hopkins actually<br />\ncame, the freshmen class would be less<br />\nthan 7 per cent black (37 out of 540),<br />\nnot \"more than 10 per cent black\" as<br />\nDr. Stanley contends.<br /><br />\nBLACK ADMISSIONS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe problem of the University's<br />\nresponsibilities toward alleviating the<br />\ninstitutional racism apparent in the<br />\neducational system of this country is a<br />\nvery complex one indeed.

Five of those nine games were<br />\nshut outs for the Blue Jay defenseman. Under the<br />\ntutelage of part-time coach Bobby Lyons, the team's<br />\nonly loss was a 2-1 affair to Maryland, but in the last<br />\ngame of the season the team came back to blank the<br />\nTerps, 3-0.<br />\nBobby Knauff's 1969 eleven just might equal or<br />\nbreak that record. Just as they might surpass the 1952<br />\nrecord for most goals in one season (29 in ten games.)<br />\nThe 1969 team could be the greatest soccer team ever to<br />\nwear a Hopkins uniform.<br />\nIn its last two games, Dickinson and Delaware fell 4-0<br />\nand 4-1 as Blue Jay fans witnessed some of the best<br />\nsoccer every played at the Hop. Not to be little the<br />\nexcellent coaching of Bob Knauff, much of the success<br />\nof this year's team belongs to former head coach Gary<br />\nBarrette. Barette was responsible for recruiting much if<br />\nnot all of the crop of sophomore talent that has kept the<br />\nJays winning.<br />\nEarly Doubts<br />\nIn the beginning of the season, there were doubts as<br />\nto whether the starting forward line would gel enough<br />\nbefore the start of the season to make the attack potent.<br />\nWell doubters can rest easy. Centerforward Bernie<br />\nWenker, who played is high school ball at Poly, has high<br />\nscoring sophomore sensation Scott Tyner (three goals in<br />\ntwo games) and juilior Ron Rowes (two goals) on the<br />\nwings to help out in the scoring column. Also adding<br />\nconsiderable punch to the first line are co-Captain Dave<br />\nRoberts, and the talkative sophomore Bob Szeles.<br />\nAt halfback, co-Captain Randy Miller is a shoe-in for<br />\nAl1=South honors again as he has turned in consistent<br />\nperformances for three years for the Blue Jay Booters.<br />\nAt the other halfback slot is another sophomore Wes<br />\nDaub\u2014a former preppy from Suffield. Daub is the<br />\nbiggest hustler on the team. Junior tochead Dan Hall is<br />\non the sidelines ready to spell Wes if he should get tired.<br />\nThe heart of the Hop defense lies in its senior<br />\nfullbacks, Rick Tobey and John Clisham. At 6-1 195<br />\npounds Clish puts fear into the hearts of opposing<br />\nlineman. The third fullbback Bob Parsley should have<br />\nmany more good games ahead of him in his soccer career<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nIn the goal are the surehands of junior Steve Weiss.<br />\nRumor has it that Steve plays a much better game of<br />\nsoccer than bridge. Backing Weiss is 200 pounder Steve<br />\nBuescher, the biggest man on the squad. A new comer to<br />\nthe sport, Buescher has picked up much needed game<br />\nexperience in the Jays first two games.<br />\nWith four seniors, three juniors, four sophomores in<br />\nthe starting line-up, and a predominantly sophomore<br />\nbench, Knaufis kickers are in for a record breaking year<br />\nin 1969, and they can be assured of many more winning<br />\nseasons in the future.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nALL-SOUTH SELECTION Randy Miller tackles unidentified Howard University player in early pre-season<br />\nscrimmage.<br />\nNoted for his consistent play, Randy is regarded as a \"teamplayer\".

The game was almost<br />\ncompletely dominated by Hopkins from the opening<br />\nmoments. despite the great number of penalities called<br />\nby the referees.<br />\nThe first score cam within the first three minutes of<br />\nthe first quarter when Bob Szeles took a centering pass<br />\nfrom Bernie Wenker and drilled it past the goalie.<br />\nHopkins also had many other opportunities to score<br />\nduring this period, but several crosses by Scott Tyner to<br />\nSzeles and Wenker in front of the net were unable to be<br />\ncapitalized upon. A corner kick by Hopkins almost<br />\nresulted in a score, as Randy Miller just missed putting<br />\nthe ball into the net.

The Blue Jays,<br />\nwho sparkled disorganized football for much of<br />\nthe remainder of the game. There also seemed<br />\nevident, a lack of hustle especially in the second<br />\n'half, as proved by numerous mistakes, penalties,<br />\nand a general lack of offensive power.<br />\nUrsinus, coming into the contest, had no victories to<br />\nits credit in two games. They ' were the obvious<br />\nunderdogs and as such, were out to upset the undefeated<br />\nBlue Jays. However, after the first quarter, it appeared as<br />\nif there would be no doubt as to the final outcome of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nHopkins scored touchdowns the second and third<br />\ntimes the offense had the ball. Strong running by Paul<br />\nWeiss and Steve Hata, Weiss looked particularly sharp,<br />\nand a pass play from ebb Pfeiffer to Hata, brought the<br />\nball deep into Ursinus territory. Pfeiffer then threw to<br />\nLatson on the Ursinus eight. Following this paly, Paul<br />\nWeiss drove off left tackle for the score.<br />\nThe Bears second attempted drive was halted when<br />\nAlton Cleveland intercepted a Pete Shuman pass at the<br />\nUrsinus 47. Again, Hopkins moved downfield, this<br />\nsequence highlighted by a fine one-handed catch by end<br />\nSteve Latson, bringing the ball to the Bear 26. Weiss,<br /><br />\na costly Hopkins holding penalty. A three yard pass<br />\nfrom Shuman to Felix Narog scored the first<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nThe Ursinus second touchdown dirve occurred early<br />\nin the second half, following a fumble by Bob Pfeiffer at<br />\nthe Bear 39 yard line. Again, Ursinus took to the air,<br />\nscoring the touchdown after five completed passes put<br />\nthe ball on the Hopkins two. Joe Corvaia ran for the<br />\nscore<br />\nAfter Ursinus' third touchdown, they were able to<br />\nconsume valuable time by sweeping the Hopkins'<br />\ndefensive ends for important yardage, while preventing<br />\nthe Blue Jays from gaining possession of the ball.<br />\nOffensively, when the Blue Jays finally got the ball,<br />\nthey were flat and inconsistent, never being able to move<br />\nthe ball downfield for a long period of time.<br />\nQuarterback Pfeiffer was yanked in favor of sub Dan<br />\nAugustine. However, Pfeiffer returned when Augustine<br />\nmet with limited success.<br /><br />\nshowing good determination and power, took the ball on<br />\nan end sweep to the eight, where Pfeiffer on the<br />\nquarterback option, ran in for the score. Hopkins led 14<br />\nto O.<br />\nHere, however, is where the game ends, from the<br />\nHopkins standpoint. They mounted only one more<br />\nsubstantial offensive threat, which was stopped by a<br />\nfumble. The Blue Jays appeared content to sit on their<br />\nlead, which naturally is impossible, when three quarters<br />\nof the game have yet to be played.<br />\nDefensively, the Hopkins team found it difficult to<br />\ncontain Ursinus' sweeps and short quick passes. The<br />\nmain fault, though, of the defensive team was its<br />\ninability to stop the Bears' third down plays, which are<br />\nso very crucial to the outcome of any football game. In<br />\nUrsinus' third and winning touchdown drive,<br />\nquarterback Pete Shuman completed three third down<br />\npasses which were good for first downs, to end Mike<br />\nMangan. With a third down and five situation, at the<br />\nBlue Jays' 21, Shuman hit Mangan who broke several<br />\ntackles and carried the ball to the five, from where,<br />\nUrsinus scored on an end sweep for the winning<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nUrsinus' first two drives for scores, were highlighted<br />\nby a potent passing attack.
