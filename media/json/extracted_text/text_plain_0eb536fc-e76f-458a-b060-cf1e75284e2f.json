Nixon.<br />\nCommenting on the fairness of<br />\nthe limited amnesty plan, Dr.<br />\nFrancis Rourke noted, \"I don't<br />\nthink the life of deserters and<br />\nexpatriots has been pleasant.\"<br />\n\"Their lives and careers have<br />\nbeen interrupted,\" he continued,<br />\n\" and they've endured separation<br />\nfrom their families and from<br />\nsociety.\"<br />\nDr. Matthew Crenson<br />\nmaintained that any injustice<br />\ninvolved not those who died in<br />\nthe Vietnam War, as Ford said in<br />\nhis amnesty announcement, but<br />\nthe draft evaders. \"It's a sloppy<br />\ndecision, full of loopholes,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"Deserters can get off, while<br />\ndraft evaders have to do<br />\nalternative service.\"<br />\nDr. J. Woodford Howard, the<br />\ndepartment chairman, stated that<br />\n<br />\nalthough it may seem unjust to<br />\npardon law-breakers such as draft<br />\nevaders when many of those men<br />\nwho served in the military dies in<br />\nVietnam, \"nothing can bring<br />\nthose men back.\"<br />\n\"Life is unfair,\" he added.<br />\nRourke concurred, noting that<br />\n\"nothing is without elements of<br />\ninequality, no matter what policy<br />\nyou have.\"<br />\nThough Howard conceded that<br />\nmany draft evaders broke the<br />\ndraft laws for \"non Vietnam<br />\nconnected reason,\" he pointed<br />\nout that the amnesty plan, unlike<br />\nthe Nixon pardon, promises<br />\nnothing more than leniency. It<br />\ndoes not erase guilt.<br />\nHe stated, though, that he<br />\nconsidered the amnesty plan a<br />\n\"sound move.\" Rourke, in turn,<br />\ndecried the timing of the pardon,<br />\nnoting that \"the nation's wounds<br />\nwere already in the process of<br />\nhealing when Ford intervened<br />\nwith the pardon,\" he reference to<br />\nthe Presiden't inaugaration<br />\npledge to \"bind the nation's<br />\nwounds.\"<br />\nCrenson deemed the plan \"not<br />\nterribly wise,\" because of the<br />\n<br />\nMatthew Crenson<br />\npossibility of \"right wing<br />\ndisapproval.\"<br />\n\"It's true,\" he explained,\"that<br />\nconservatives don't have anyplace<br />\nto go, but when election day<br />\ncomes around, they can always<br />\nstay home.\"<br />\nHoward predicted success for<br />\nthe amnesty program, if it is<br />\nadministered by the courts with a<br />\nspirit of lenience.\" Under these<br />\ncircumstances, he said,<br />\n\"beneficiaries will come forth in<br />\nlarge numbers.\"<br />\n<br />\nBob Hieronimus speaks at 'Sunday Experience'<br />\n<br />\nBob Hieronimus<br />\n<br />\nBy BOB BUCHANAN<br />\n\"By December of 1974 it will<br />\nbecome readily apparent that<br />\nwe're in for an economic trip<br />\nthat will change this country's<br />\nentire way of looking at things,\"<br />\npredicted Bob Hieronimus,<br />\nfeatured speaker in this past<br />\nweek's \"Sunday Experience,\"<br />\nsponsored by the Office of the<br />\nChaplain.<br />\nHieronimus, a noted artist<br />\nfrom Baltimore's Savitria<br />\ncommune, John Yonckur, a<br />\nsecond year student at St. Mary's<br />\nSeminary, and Joan Betty, a<br />\nthree year resident of Baltimore's<br />\nToad Hall commune, spoke on<br />\n\"Changes in Communal<br />\nPatterns.\"<br />\nYonckur spoke first,<br />\nexplaining the basic role of the<br />\nSt. Mary's seminary in vocational<br />\nand academic terms. \"St. Mary's<br />\nexists as an experience of love<br />\nand as a service to the<br />\ncommunity,\" he said.<br />\nBetty asserted very strongly<br />\nthe need for communal living,<br />\nreferring to the commune as an<br />\n<br />\ninstitution. She stated that she<br />\nhad joined the Toad Hall<br />\ncommune immediately following<br />\nher separation from her husband.<br />\nHer most interesting comments<br />\ncentered around the advantages<br />\nshe felt her child had received<br />\nfrom growing up in a communal<br />\nsetting.<br />\nFounding of Savitria<br />\n\"Here [in the commune]<br />\nother adults had an influence on<br />\nmy child. I wasn't the only one.<br />\nThis was more apt to take up the<br />\nslack in the helping relationship<br />\nshe needed.\"<br />\nHieronimus focused his<br />\ndiscussion on the rapidly<br />\nchanging society which seems to<br />\nhim to have \"rid itself of nearly<br />\nevery human aspect.\"<br />\nHieronimus began by<br />\ncommenting on the founding of<br />\nSavitria, the commune which he<br />\nand 11 others founded<br />\nSeptember 1, 1969.<br />\nMeditation<br />\nShortly after completing his<br />\nmural, The Apocalypse in<br />\nChester's Place of the Hopkins'<br />\n<br />\nStudent Union, he began to hold<br />\nmeditation sessions at Hopkins<br />\nwhich eventually grew to<br />\naccommodate between 80 and<br />\n100 people.<br />\n\"We found that we couldn't<br />\nsee each other as often as we<br />\nwanted to after meditations were<br />\nheld. So we decided to live<br />\ntogether in a mansion. The<br />\nunification of all men is the<br />\ntheme of the household,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nCommenting on the benefits<br />\nderived from the communal<br />\nmeditation sessions, Hieronimus<br />\ninformed the audience that after<br />\nmeditation, \"You begin to see<br />\nthings in different relation to<br />\ntime in general.\"<br />\n,Dilemma answered<br />\nPointing to his reasons for<br />\npainting The Apocalypse he said,<br />\n\"It was done because there were<br />\na number of pictures which I saw<br />\nwhen I was raising consciousness.<br />\nI envisioned that the country was<br />\neither going to fall apart slowly,<br />\ndeliberately, as is now happening,<br />\nor be reborn.\"<br />\n<br />\nHieronimus offered what he<br />\nsaw as the answer to this<br />\ndilemma. \"The only solution I<br />\nsaw was for people to become<br />\nmore personal. But how do you<br />\ndo that?\" He alluded to examples<br />\nof this apparent trend to<br />\nintrovertism in American society,<br />\ncommenting, \"People live right<br />\nnext door to each other and<br />\ndon't even know one another.\"<br />\nFollowing his comments on<br />\nthe inadequacies of<br />\ncontemporary educational<br />\npractices for the young,<br />\nHieronimus predicted a variety of<br />\nplights for America. With regards<br />\nto his prediction of economic<br />\ncollapse in 1975, Hieronimus<br />\nadded, \"Compared to this, 1929<br />\nwas just a baby.\" lie claimed that<br />\nby 1996 \"the population of<br />\nAmerica will be less than 15<br />\nmillion.\"<br />\nHieronimus attributed his<br />\nprophecies to an inner awareness<br />\nafforded by his meditation.<br />\n\"When you develop inner vision<br />\nyou don't have to look back to<br />\nJeanne Dixon,\" he added.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE HOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nvol. bcxix no.6Ituesdav. september 24, 19741baltimore, maryland179th year<br />\n<br />\nenough already<br />\nAlthough it seemed as'if things couldn't get much worse in<br />\nthe Rathskellar,..they did. As if the initial theft of beer mugs<br />\nand, pitchers, tables, and chairs wasn't enough,<br />\nundergraduates last week contrived to unhinge a door,<br />\nvandalize a bathroom, and steal S800 worth of sound<br />\nequipment from their own Student Council.<br />\nHopkins Union officials have drawn the unavoidable<br />\ninference\u2014that the facility must either be shut down or<br />\noperate on a reduced schedule\u2014and it is difficult to blame<br />\nthem. There is no longer any alibi. In accordance with<br />\nRathskellar regulations, only Hopkins students and<br />\nemployees, and Goucher students are granted entrance to the<br />\nfacility. Administrators are undeniably correct in their<br />\nassumption that Hopkins students are mostly, if not entirely.<br />\nto blame.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe vandals\u2014undoubtedly a small group of<br />\nundergraduates\u2014have confirmed the fundamentally cynical<br />\nattitude of the administration towards student activities, and<br />\ngiven substance to the suspicions of certain members of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees that students will not take care of a facility<br />\nlike the Rathskellar, if it is given to them.<br />\nWorst of all, they have shown all members of the<br />\nUniversity community that undergraduates are not capable of<br />\ncontrolling themselves without supervision.<br />\nThe only avenue left is one of contrition. If conditions<br />\nimprove dramatically, if the stolen merchandise is returned, if<br />\nstudents begin to take responsibility for the actions of their<br />\npeers, maybe Union officials will not render that harsh<br />\npenalty\u2014the closing of the Rathskellar\u2014even though, by all<br />\nevidence, they would be fully justified in so doing.<br />\n<br />\nHere's the Hopkins exhibit at the Baltimore City Fair, entitled, cryptically enough, 'water.<br />\n<br />\nAnd you wonder why I carry a crowbar<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nSometimes when I'm walking<br />\nhome late at night, I see someone<br />\ncoming down the street from the<br />\nopposite direction, and I wish I<br />\ncould just sprout wings and fly<br />\n<br />\nIt don't go with Desolation Row<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\n8/31\u2014\"Any day now, any day<br />\nnow, I shall be released.\" Summer<br />\nwork now a conversation piece.<br />\nRiding down to Baltimore, I'm<br />\ntired and hungover and glad to be<br />\nthe hell out of Princeton.

There, on North Charles<br />\nStreet, a fatal 30 yards away from<br />\nthe, Hopkins campus and its<br />\nprotective Pinkertons, I was<br />\ndivested of my wallet and the ten<br />\ndollars it was holding along with<br />\nmy driver's license, senior<br />\nlifesaving card, Hopkins I.D., and a<br />\nprecious photograph of my six<br />\nyear old sister.<br />\nThe robbery itself, however, was<br />\ninsufficient gratulation for the<br />\nbeasts.

Then, after leaving some<br />\ngratuitous lumps on my jaw and<br />\nforehead, they stole away into the<br />\nnight like apparitions, into Wyman<br />\nPark and impunity. I was left<br />\nstanding there on the side of<br />\nCharles Street feeling utterly.<br />\nraped.<br />\n\"Very Common\"<br />\nI managed to make it the rest of<br />\nthe way home without catastrophe<br />\nand immediately notified the<br />\nBaltimore City Police of the crime.<br />\n\"Yes, a very common crime,\" they<br />\nsaid. \"We'll send an officer over<br />\nright away for the incident<br />\nreport.\" Within five minutes there<br />\n<br />\nmy driver's license replaced. \"You<br />\ncan come down to headquarters<br />\nand look at files for identification<br />\nif you want,\" he explained.\"But it<br />\nwon't do a bit of good.\" Truthful,<br />\nat least.<br />\nThen there was the call home,<br />\nassuring my mother that I wasn't<br />\nhurt, and explaining to my little<br />\nbrother why I didn't fight back.<br />\nThere is no end to the humiliation.<br />\nOh, Benjie<br />\nSo, you see, now my mind is<br />\nconditioned. I rarely walk the<br />\nstreets after dark alone anymore,<br />\nand when some of my friends<br />\nexplain how, in the same situation,<br />\nthey would have resisted, I think<br />\n\"Oh, you cretins.\"<br />\nBenjie and I, though, have<br />\nformulated a program designed to<br />\nrid me of my terror.

The same<br />\nwretch who robbed the friar in the<br />\ntown square might later that same<br />\nnight have assaulted the mayor's<br />\nwife. Villainy was a lucrative<br />\nbusiness in the Middle Ages, what<br />\nwith the lack of stable authority<br />\nand all. The urban denizens of the<br />\n20th Century took the cue<br />\ntherefrom, and, by that process<br />\nwhich we call specialization, honed<br />\ndown the variables involved, and<br />\nmade the execution of a mugging<br />\nnearly foolproof.<br />\nMy experience with the<br />\nmiscreants of Baltimore was, at<br />\nleast partially, my own fault.

The relative anonymity<br />\nof Coach Dennis Cox to sports<br />\nfans outside of Hopkins<br />\nespecially, has led to this<br />\nexclusive story (AP eat your<br />\nheart out!) on the man himself.<br />\nCoach Cox is a native to the<br />\nHopkins area. He grew up in East<br />\nBaltimore and attended high<br />\nschool at Calvert Hall where he<br />\nwas an all-around athlete. Besides<br />\nfootball, he was on both the<br />\nbasketball and baseball teams and<br />\nalso participated in soccer and<br />\ntrack.<br />\nThough the Hall's\" football<br />\nteam as a whole was just average,<br />\n<br />\nCoach Cox<br />\n<br />\nCox distinguished himself by<br />\nwinning honorable mention<br />\nall-star honors. He was captain of<br />\na chanipionship basketball team<br />\nand starred on a baseball team<br />\nwhich was one of the best in<br />\nBaltimore's history.<br />\nAfter graduating from Calvert<br />\nHall in 1956, Cox decided to<br />\nattend Bucknell University in<br />\nLewisburg, Pennsylvania. During<br />\nthe summer after high school he<br />\nplayed amateur baseball under<br />\nthe tutelage of the present<br />\nsupervisor of all eastern Oriole<br />\nscouts.<br />\nProwess<br />\nAt Bucknell, Cox limited his<br />\nathletic endeavors slightly,<br />\nconfining himself to just the<br />\nfootball and baseball teams<br />\nexcept for one brief fling at<br />\nboxing. Despite having no<br />\nprevious experience in the sport,<br />\nhe showed his athletic prowess<br />\nby winning the intramural<br />\nheavyweight crown at Bucknell.<br />\nThe Bixon's football team<br />\nshowed constant improvement<br />\neach year Cox was there. He<br />\nstarted out at quarterback, but<br />\nduring his three years of varsity<br />\nexperience at Bucknell, he<br />\nmanaged to play every position<br />\nexcept tackle.<br />\nIn 1963, Cox moved back to<br />\nhis alma mater, Calvert Hall,<br />\nwhere he was assistant football<br />\ncoach as well as head J.V.<br />\nbaseball coach. When asked<br />\nabout his 3 years at the Hall, Cox<br />\nsaid, \"I helped establish the<br />\nwinning tradition which remains<br />\nthere even today, making them<br />\none of Baltimore's perennial<br />\nfootball powerhouses.\"<br />\nAfter a three year stint as head<br />\nfootball coach at Bishop<br />\nO'Connell High School in<br />\nArlington, Virginia where he also<br />\nestablished a winning tradition,<br />\n<br />\nCox came to Hopkins as<br />\ndefensive line coach in 1969.

In fact when<br />\ntalking about the subject of<br />\nrecruiting, Coach Cox said that,<br />\n\"As far as recruiting goes, my job<br />\nis one of public relations, that is,<br />\nto educate people to the fact that<br />\nHopkins is more than just a<br />\nhospital and, in fact, does have a<br />\n<br />\nNEws-lErrER<br />\n<br />\nvery solid football program.\"<br />\nSo let USC keep John McKay,<br />\nCoach,Dennis Cox is not only an<br />\nasset ' to the Hopkins Athletic<br />\nDepartment, but a fine example<br />\nfor the entire Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.

Nixon.<br />\nCommenting on the fairness of<br />\nthe limited amnesty plan, Dr.<br />\nFrancis Rourke noted, \"I don't<br />\nthink the life of deserters and<br />\nexpatriots has been pleasant.\"<br />\n\"Their lives and careers have<br />\nbeen interrupted,\" he continued,<br />\n\" and they've endured separation<br />\nfrom their families and from<br />\nsociety.\"<br />\nDr. Matthew Crenson<br />\nmaintained that any injustice<br />\ninvolved not those who died in<br />\nthe Vietnam War, as Ford said in<br />\nhis amnesty announcement, but<br />\nthe draft evaders. \"It's a sloppy<br />\ndecision, full of loopholes,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"Deserters can get off, while<br />\ndraft evaders have to do<br />\nalternative service.\"<br />\nDr. J. Woodford Howard, the<br />\ndepartment chairman, stated that<br /><br />\nalthough it may seem unjust to<br />\npardon law-breakers such as draft<br />\nevaders when many of those men<br />\nwho served in the military dies in<br />\nVietnam, \"nothing can bring<br />\nthose men back.\"<br />\n\"Life is unfair,\" he added.<br />\nRourke concurred, noting that<br />\n\"nothing is without elements of<br />\ninequality, no matter what policy<br />\nyou have.\"<br />\nThough Howard conceded that<br />\nmany draft evaders broke the<br />\ndraft laws for \"non Vietnam<br />\nconnected reason,\" he pointed<br />\nout that the amnesty plan, unlike<br />\nthe Nixon pardon, promises<br />\nnothing more than leniency. It<br />\ndoes not erase guilt.<br />\nHe stated, though, that he<br />\nconsidered the amnesty plan a<br />\n\"sound move.\" Rourke, in turn,<br />\ndecried the timing of the pardon,<br />\nnoting that \"the nation's wounds<br />\nwere already in the process of<br />\nhealing when Ford intervened<br />\nwith the pardon,\" he reference to<br />\nthe Presiden't inaugaration<br />\npledge to \"bind the nation's<br />\nwounds.\"<br />\nCrenson deemed the plan \"not<br />\nterribly wise,\" because of the<br /><br />\nMatthew Crenson<br />\npossibility of \"right wing<br />\ndisapproval.\"<br />\n\"It's true,\" he explained,\"that<br />\nconservatives don't have anyplace<br />\nto go, but when election day<br />\ncomes around, they can always<br />\nstay home.\"<br />\nHoward predicted success for<br />\nthe amnesty program, if it is<br />\nadministered by the courts with a<br />\nspirit of lenience.\" Under these<br />\ncircumstances, he said,<br />\n\"beneficiaries will come forth in<br />\nlarge numbers.\"<br /><br />\nBob Hieronimus speaks at 'Sunday Experience'<br /><br />\nBob Hieronimus<br /><br />\nBy BOB BUCHANAN<br />\n\"By December of 1974 it will<br />\nbecome readily apparent that<br />\nwe're in for an economic trip<br />\nthat will change this country's<br />\nentire way of looking at things,\"<br />\npredicted Bob Hieronimus,<br />\nfeatured speaker in this past<br />\nweek's \"Sunday Experience,\"<br />\nsponsored by the Office of the<br />\nChaplain.<br />\nHieronimus, a noted artist<br />\nfrom Baltimore's Savitria<br />\ncommune, John Yonckur, a<br />\nsecond year student at St. Mary's<br />\nSeminary, and Joan Betty, a<br />\nthree year resident of Baltimore's<br />\nToad Hall commune, spoke on<br />\n\"Changes in Communal<br />\nPatterns.\"<br />\nYonckur spoke first,<br />\nexplaining the basic role of the<br />\nSt. Mary's seminary in vocational<br />\nand academic terms. \"St. Mary's<br />\nexists as an experience of love<br />\nand as a service to the<br />\ncommunity,\" he said.<br />\nBetty asserted very strongly<br />\nthe need for communal living,<br />\nreferring to the commune as an<br /><br />\ninstitution.

According to Dea<br />\nKline, Director of Community<br />\nAffairs for the University, each<br />\nmeeting features a speaker with<br />\nspecial knowledge on affairs<br />\nwhich are very important to the<br />\ncommunity. Past speakers have<br />\nincluded Baltimore Mayor<br />\nWilliam Donald Schaefer,<br />\nRepresentative Paul S. Sarbanes,<br />\nand Baltimore City Council<br />\nPresident Walter S. Orlinsky.<br /><br />\nThe breakfast seminars were<br />\nbegun in the 65-66' academic<br />\nyear by Ross Jones, now Vice<br />\nPresident for University Affairs.<br />\nThe initial purpose was to bring<br />\ntogether for discussion the heads<br />\nof various community<br />\ninstitutions. The meetings<br />\ncentered around problems of<br />\nneighborhood stabilization which<br />\narise as an urban community gets<br />\nolder.<br />\nIn 1967 when Kline came to<br />\nJohns Hopkins, the breakfast<br />\nformat was broadened to include<br />\nnot only the heads of<br />\nneighborhood institutions, but<br />\ngovernment officials and<br />\ninterested community members<br />\nas well. Discussion topics now<br />\nfocus on all aspects of city life.<br />\n\"We realize that good<br />\ncommunity life won't be resolved<br />\nin one area such as improved<br />\ntransportation or housing.<br />\nThrough this series we are trying<br /><br />\nto increase knowledge about<br />\nwhat's happening in each of these<br />\nsegments,\" Kline said.<br />\nParticipants in the program<br />\nseem to gain a great deal. \"The<br />\nfun part,\" says Kline, \"is<br />\nalthough the agenda is stated<br />\nthere will be dozens of hidden<br />\nagenda.

The relative anonymity<br />\nof Coach Dennis Cox to sports<br />\nfans outside of Hopkins<br />\nespecially, has led to this<br />\nexclusive story (AP eat your<br />\nheart out!) on the man himself.<br />\nCoach Cox is a native to the<br />\nHopkins area. He grew up in East<br />\nBaltimore and attended high<br />\nschool at Calvert Hall where he<br />\nwas an all-around athlete. Besides<br />\nfootball, he was on both the<br />\nbasketball and baseball teams and<br />\nalso participated in soccer and<br />\ntrack.<br />\nThough the Hall's\" football<br />\nteam as a whole was just average,<br /><br />\nCoach Cox<br /><br />\nCox distinguished himself by<br />\nwinning honorable mention<br />\nall-star honors. He was captain of<br />\na chanipionship basketball team<br />\nand starred on a baseball team<br />\nwhich was one of the best in<br />\nBaltimore's history.<br />\nAfter graduating from Calvert<br />\nHall in 1956, Cox decided to<br />\nattend Bucknell University in<br />\nLewisburg, Pennsylvania. During<br />\nthe summer after high school he<br />\nplayed amateur baseball under<br />\nthe tutelage of the present<br />\nsupervisor of all eastern Oriole<br />\nscouts.<br />\nProwess<br />\nAt Bucknell, Cox limited his<br />\nathletic endeavors slightly,<br />\nconfining himself to just the<br />\nfootball and baseball teams<br />\nexcept for one brief fling at<br />\nboxing. Despite having no<br />\nprevious experience in the sport,<br />\nhe showed his athletic prowess<br />\nby winning the intramural<br />\nheavyweight crown at Bucknell.<br />\nThe Bixon's football team<br />\nshowed constant improvement<br />\neach year Cox was there. He<br />\nstarted out at quarterback, but<br />\nduring his three years of varsity<br />\nexperience at Bucknell, he<br />\nmanaged to play every position<br />\nexcept tackle.<br />\nIn 1963, Cox moved back to<br />\nhis alma mater, Calvert Hall,<br />\nwhere he was assistant football<br />\ncoach as well as head J.V.<br />\nbaseball coach. When asked<br />\nabout his 3 years at the Hall, Cox<br />\nsaid, \"I helped establish the<br />\nwinning tradition which remains<br />\nthere even today, making them<br />\none of Baltimore's perennial<br />\nfootball powerhouses.\"<br />\nAfter a three year stint as head<br />\nfootball coach at Bishop<br />\nO'Connell High School in<br />\nArlington, Virginia where he also<br />\nestablished a winning tradition,<br /><br />\nCox came to Hopkins as<br />\ndefensive line coach in 1969. He<br />\nbecame head football coach in<br />\nApril, 1971 and brought his<br />\nwinning tradition here.<br />\nThis being his fourth season,<br />\nall of Coach Cox's previous<br />\nelevens have finished with strong<br />\n6-3 records, especially impressive<br />\nin view that Hopkins utilizes no<br /><br />\nrecruiting practices, such as<br />\nathletic scholarships, as used in<br />\nother schools. In fact when<br />\ntalking about the subject of<br />\nrecruiting, Coach Cox said that,<br />\n\"As far as recruiting goes, my job<br />\nis one of public relations, that is,<br />\nto educate people to the fact that<br />\nHopkins is more than just a<br />\nhospital and, in fact, does have a<br /><br />\nNEws-lErrER<br /><br />\nvery solid football program.\"<br />\nSo let USC keep John McKay,<br />\nCoach,Dennis Cox is not only an<br />\nasset ' to the Hopkins Athletic<br />\nDepartment, but a fine example<br />\nfor the entire Hopkins<br />\ncommunity. We wish him<br />\ncontinued success in the winning<br />\ntradition he has established here<br />\nat Hopkins.<br /><br />\nsports<br /><br />\nRifle team offers change of pace<br />\nBy LAURA L.
