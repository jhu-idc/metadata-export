Moreover, all the members of the corps<br />\nwho are over eighteen years old<br />\nand are physically capable would<br />\nprobably receive non - commissioned offices in the Army and<br />\nwould immediately set about<br />\ntraining recruits.<br />\nImmediately following a war<br />\ndeclaration, drills of the most<br />\nvigorous character would be held<br />\nevery day. Though at present all<br />\nthe drill hours are Spent in combat<br />\ndrill, in learning how to advance<br />\nas skirmishers and what to do in<br />\nthe various stages of attack, these<br />\nphases and the many more which<br />\ncharacterize the real battle would<br />\nbe taught and gone into more minutely. Every afternoon would<br />\nfind the companies advancing and<br />\nrushing in skirmish through the<br />\nsurrounding woods, solving tactical problems and performing every<br />\nact necessary in real combat.<br />\nUnfortunately for the battalion, Lieutenant Elliott, who has been<br />\ntaking his examinations for a<br />\ncaptain's commission during the<br />\nlast two weeks, would probably<br />\nbe ordered back to his regiment.<br />\nFirst Sergeant Friedlander would<br />\nalso probably be ordered back to<br />\nhis, and First Sergeant Evans<br />\nwould be put on recruiting duty.<br />\nThis would leave the battalion in<br />\nthe hands of Major Linton, who,<br />\nhowever, is able to carry on the<br />\ntraining most efficiently, as he<br />\nhas had much experience in military work.<br />\nOne hundred and seventy rifles<br />\nhave been shipped, for the battalion from Troy, N. Y., and will<br />\narrive as quickly as the railroads<br />\ncan bring them. They will be<br />\nkept in racks which are under<br />\nconstruction in the old gymnasium back of Carroll Mansion. As<br />\nmost of the drill hours in the last<br />\nmonth have been used in mastering the manual of arms, the battalion is ready to handle the guns<br />\nas soon as they appear.<br />\n<br />\n\"Resolved, That the trustees of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\npledge the loyal I support of the<br />\nUniversity to the Government of<br />\nthe United States in its plans for<br />\nnational defense.\"<br />\nThis is the resolution which the<br />\nHopkins Board of Trustees has<br />\nsent to President Wilson, as an<br />\nindication of the way in which the<br />\nUniversity will stand behind him<br />\nin case war with Germany is declared.<br />\nAt the same meeting that this<br />\nresolution was adopted, another,<br />\nmotion was passed which created<br />\na Hopkins Committee on Research<br />\nto act in co-operation with the<br />\nNational Council of Research recently appointed at the President's request by the National<br />\nCommittee of Science.<br />\nThe duty of the Hopkins committee will be to stimulate invention in methods of defense<br />\nand offense and to assist in the<br />\nindustrial mobilization of thecountry.<br />\nThe personnel of the committee<br />\nis as follows: The President of<br />\nthe University, the President of<br />\nthe Board of Trustees, Ira Remsen, Joseph S. Ames, Walter A.<br />\nBaetjer, J. C. W. Frazer, Jacob<br />\nH. Hollander,Walter Jones, Burton E. Livingston Harry F. Reid,<br />\nWilliam H.Welch, John B.Whitehead, Daniel Willard, Frederick<br />\nW. Wood and R. W. Wood.<br />\nJust what official steps the University would take in case war is<br />\ndeclared can not of course be predicted.. There seems to be little<br />\ndoubt in official quarters how'could<br />\never, that the Government<br />\ncall upon the University to do\u2022<br />\nanything within its power, at<br />\nwhatever sacrifice the act would<br />\nbe performed.<br />\nWhen questioned as to the possibility of the Senior Class being<br />\ngraduated a few months earlier,<br />\nin case war is declared and volunteers are called for, President<br />\nGoodnow said that such a matter<br />\nwould have to be determined by<br />\nthe faculty. His manner indicated, however, that the loyalty<br />\nof Hopkins students would not<br />\nnecessitate the sacrifice or postponement of their degrees.<br />\nIt is also probable that in<br />\ncase of war, the University labo-<br />\n<br />\nDr. Lorraine S. Hulburt has announced to a representative of<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER that plans for<br />\nthe cataloging of the University<br />\nalumni and students according to<br />\nthe parts which they could play<br />\nin time of war would be ready<br />\nfor announcement within 4 few<br />\ndays.<br />\nIn this catalogue, every one (A<br />\nthe four thousand Hopkins alumni, all the graduate students and<br />\nprobably at least the seniors and<br />\njuniors among the undergraduates will have appended to his<br />\nname the general lines along<br />\nwhich his education has been conducted and the position in which<br />\nhe could serve the Government<br />\nmost capably.<br />\nAs was announced in THE<br />\n'NEWS-LETTER last week, this work<br />\nis being carried on by Dr. Hulburt in connection with the Intercollegiate Intelligence Bureau.<br />\nThis bureau has for its aim the<br />\norganization of the potential resources of every important college<br />\nand university in the country.<br />\nThe work upon which Dr. Hulburt is now engaged is the determination of the most efficient<br />\nand at the same time the quickest<br />\nway of obtaining the desired information. Once that the investigation has been thoroughly<br />\nplanned, with prompt co-operation, the actual execution should<br />\ntake very little time.<br />\nThe list, when it has been compiled, will immediately be sent to<br />\nthe United States War Department. If war is declared it will<br />\ngive the Government valuable aid<br />\nin providing it with access to the<br />\nservices of thousands of highly<br />\ntrained men.<br />\nAt the present time it seems<br />\nprobable that there will be more<br />\nneed of physicists and chemists<br />\nthan of the men who have pursued<br />\nother branches of learning. The<br />\nlist, however, is to be comprehensive.<br />\n<br />\nActive plans are being carried<br />\nout at the Johns Hopkins Hospital for the formation of a base<br />\nhospital that would be placed at<br />\nthe disposal of the Government in<br />\nthe event of war. The Government is encouraging the organization of such hospital units in all<br />\nthe large medical schools and hospitals in the country. About<br />\nthirty of these have been formed,<br />\nof which Hopkins is listed as unit<br />\nNo. 18.<br />\nThe personnel of the staff in the<br />\nproposed unit and the equipment<br />\nbeing gathered at Hopkins are of<br />\nsuch a character as to mark Hopkins as one of the best base hospitals at the Government's disposal.<br />\nDr. Winford Smith is the director<br />\nof the organization and he has under him some of the most prominentphysicians and surgeons in the<br />\ncity. The staff is made up of doctors who are or have been connected with Hopkins.<br />\nIn addition to the doctors on<br />\nthe staff, there is a large reserve<br />\nlist of those who desire to offer<br />\ntheir services in time of war,<br />\nwhich will make it possible for<br />\nthe Hopkins unit to increase its<br />\nstaff in a great emergency, and to<br />\nkeep its ranks always full of competent physicians.<br />\nThe staff is divided into three<br />\ngroups: The surgeons, the physicians and the laboratory workers.<br />\nDr. J. M. T. Finney is the chief<br />\nof the surgical division and he has<br />\nunder him specialists in the various lines of surgery. Dr. Janeway has charge of the physicians,<br />\nand Dr. Boggs of the laboratory<br />\ndivision. There are also in the<br />\nunit two dentists, fifty trained<br />\nnurses, twenty-five nurses' aids<br />\nwho are trained in Red Cross<br />\nwork, an adjutant, a quartermaster, a registrar, a chaplain and a<br />\nstaff of about eighty orderlies,<br />\nstretcher bearers, cooks, waiters,<br />\ncarpenters, electricians, maids,<br />\nclerks and stenographers.<br />\nWith the staff of doctors enlisted up to Government requirements, the only problem that now<br />\nremains is the raising of funds for<br />\nratories would be put at the com- the purchase of equipment. The remand, of the Government to carry quired number of bandages, beds,<br />\nout whatever work is needed. In bed linen, surgical dressings, etc.,<br />\nthe words of President Goodnow, have already been procured and<br />\n\"Johns Hopkins is ready to serve are packed for shipment to the<br />\nits country with every resource region of hostilities at a moment's<br />\nthat it commands.\"<br />\n(Continued on page 3, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MARCH 19, 1917.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hosiery Shop<br />\nBaltimore's Only Exclusive Hosiery Shop<br />\nfor Men<br />\n<br />\n215 N.

Johns Hopkins<br />\nwas placed in a position of particular prominence by the splendid sendoff given us by Mr. Kirby, chairman of the executive committee.

Yet the<br />\nfact remains that the reputation<br />\nof the University was built and is<br />\nbeing preserved through the work<br />\ndone in its graduate departments.<br />\nFor that reason, the position of<br />\nthe Hopkins undergraduate is a<br />\npeculiar one. Viewed from the<br />\nstandpoint of President Gilman,<br />\nhe might very easily be judged an<br />\nanomaly. Good as the collegiate<br />\ndepartment undeniably is, it has<br />\ngrown up as a subsidiary branch<br />\nof the University \u2014 occupying a<br />\nplace entirely unique in the history of American education. The<br />\nreason why Hopkins was worldknoww ten years after its foundation was that its initial aim had<br />\nbeen to train its students in the<br />\nhighest forms of research. There<br />\nwere already many institutions in<br />\nwhich a collegiate education was<br />\nvery adequately given \u2014 Hopking<br />\ninaugurated a new era in the history of American universities in<br />\nthat it refused to devote itself to<br />\nthe training of college men, confining its attention to the development of scholars. The only excuse for the building up of the collegiate department was that it fulfilled a local need and acted as<br />\na pecuniary feeder without interfering with the high standard of<br />\nthe graduate work.<br />\nThere are two courses which a<br />\ncollege situated in such a position can follow.

Only the strong<br />\nwill survive, and nations must_<br />\nfight for their existence.\"<br />\nDr. Hill said America should<br />\nsupport the 'entente allies' ideal,<br />\ndeclaring they have appealed to<br />\nthe, conscience of mankind in recognizing that imperialism is not<br />\nmerely a sort of harmless national<br />\npride, but a real spirit and creed.<br />\nIn sUpport of this statement, he<br />\nread excerpts from several inflammatory pamphlets spread<br />\nthrough Central Europe by the<br />\npan-Germanists before the war. \u2022<br />\nLong before the outbreak of the<br />\npresent war and even as.far back<br />\nas 1885, the more radical element<br />\nin Germany were apparently lusting for world dominion, Dr. Hill<br />\nsaid. He cited the predictions of<br />\na German writer of that date who<br />\nhad constructed maps of a worldwide Teutonic empire and. told<br />\nhow it could be acquired. Among<br />\nother things, France was to cede<br />\nlarge portions of her eastern front<br />\nand to pay a huge indeninity. The<br />\nseizure of Cuba and the Philippines was also part of the plan.<br />\nCuba seemed an ideal point from<br />\nwhich to dominate the Gulf of<br />\nMexico and to establish a closer<br />\nconnection with the ten million<br />\nGermans in America.<br />\n\"And, although I do not assert<br />\nthat these ideals were held by the<br />\nrulers of Germany,\" Dr Hill con. eluded, \"it is nevertheless a sign i hcant fact that 90 percent. of it<br />\nhas been, at least temporarily,<br />\ncarried out since 1914.\"<br />\nThe next lecture by Dr. Hill was<br />\ngiven (in'March\u202215 on \"The Transfiguration of thi\u00eaGCiiiia\u00f1 Empire.\"<br />\n<br />\n1920 Elects Captains and Managers.<br />\n<br />\nThe 1920 Class held a special<br />\nmeeting on Thursday in the lecture hall of the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding and elected the captains<br />\nand manager of the spring teams.<br />\nHoward Knipp, brother of \"Johnny\" Knipp; captain of the 'Varsity twelve, was chosen as leader<br />\nof the lAcrosse team. Knipp<br />\ncomes from the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, where he was a<br />\nstar at the first attack position<br />\nfor two years. \"Dick\" Holmes'<br />\nwas elected to manage the twelve.<br />\nHolmes also comes from the Polytechnic Institute, where he played<br />\non the football and lacrosse<br />\ntea ms.<br />\n\"Dick\" Benson was ehosen to<br />\nlead the freshman baseball team,<br />\nwith Lawrence Littman as manager.<br />\n<br />\nThe works of Dr. Edward Meyer,<br />\nof Berlin, and of Dr. Nauman<br />\nwere discussed in order to bring<br />\nout the ideals and aims of the<br />\nGerman Empire of today.<br />\nBy quoting Dr. Meyer, Dr. Hill<br />\nshowed that the Germans believe<br />\nthat the earth can not have peace<br />\nuntil Germany is victorious.<br />\nMeyer says that if Germany were<br />\ndefeated, it would mean continuous war in the future until ,Germany has secured what she wants.<br />\nShe is thinking of her own interests, regardless of international<br />\nlaw.<br />\nStill quoting from Meyer, Dr.<br />\nHill said that in order to succeed in her plans of expansion<br />\nand aggression, Germany was<br />\nstriving to perfect her military<br />\norganization, perfect her marine<br />\norganization, so as to make her<br />\nindependent of the rest of the<br />\nworld, and to establish her emperor as an absolute monarch.<br />\nThe Germans believe that this war<br />\nis a fight to the finish between hnperialism and democracy ; that<br />\nimperialism, as exemplified by<br />\nGermany, will conquer and that<br />\ndemocracy will be expelled from<br />\nthe earth.<br />\n\"The new Germany,\" Dr. Hill<br />\nsaid,\" will be prepared for war,<br />\nwill be under one absolute ruler,<br />\naccountable to no one,whose interest will be the extension of his<br />\npower. Peace can only come when<br />\nit is imposed by the conqueror.<br />\n<br />\nThis is the claim and the boast-of Germany.\"<br />\nDr. Hill then called up a vision<br />\nof Germany as she used to be\u2014<br />\nGermany, the teacher of science,<br />\nof art, of niusic, of literature.<br />\nThe new Germany, he said, desires a union with Austria that<br />\nwill cement the two into one powerful nation, fortified from the<br />\ntest of the world. The sthall<br />\nstates, according to Germany's<br />\nidea, would soon be frightened<br />\ninto adherance to the Central<br />\nPowers, as that would be their<br />\nonly means of. securing protection<br />\nand peace.<br />\n\"In all the German ideals,\" he<br />\ncontinued, \"there is no proposal<br />\nto restore peace, and no reference<br />\nto neutrals, except to say that<br />\nsmall states can not remain aloof,<br />\nbut must seek entrance into the<br />\nCentral Powers. In expressing<br />\nthis idea in one of his books, Dr.<br />\nNauman significantly remarks<br />\nthat all treaties with small states<br />\nmay not be respected.\"<br />\n\"According to German writers,\"<br />\nthe lecturer added sarcastically,<br />\n\"these ideals and aims for German dominion of most of Europe,<br />\n\u2022if not of the world,\u2022did not antedate the war, and did not enter<br />\ninto the causes of the war.\"<br />\nThere will be two more lectures<br />\nby Dr. Hill\u2014one on -March 20 on<br />\n\"The Visions of a CoMmonwealth\"<br />\nand the other on March 22 on<br />\n\"Internat ional Organization.\"<br />\n<br />\nD.%\u2022<br />\n<br />\n-SC<br />\n<br />\nThe 20th Century<br />\nway of writing<br />\npersonally<br />\n<br />\nTwo's company, three's a crowd in private correspondence.<br />\nCome in and be convinced that<br />\n<br />\nCORONA<br />\n<br />\nThe Personal Writing Machine<br />\nenables you to type your private writing without anyone's aid<br />\nas aEcurately,cleanly and readably as can any trained typist.<br />\n<br />\nM.

NILES<br />\n<br />\nthough now far advanced, is not<br />\ncomplete, and it will be the privilege of the new Rhodes scholars<br />\nto witness not only its final<br />\nstages,but also to see the stupendous work of reconstruction which<br />\nmust inevitably follow the declaration of peace. To see these<br />\nthings and to be almost a part<br />\nof them is, to my mind, of infinitely more value than to spend three<br />\npleasant years of normal Oxford<br />\nlife.<br />\nBesides the great opportunities<br />\nfor observation, there are for<br />\nRho des scholars innumerable<br />\nchances to help, to do their bit<br />\nfor people who need help. There<br />\nis the Belgian Relief Commission; there is social work in England left by those who have gone<br />\nto the front; there is the Y. M. C.<br />\nA. with the British Army, work<br />\nthat has taken Rhodes scholars<br />\nto India, to Mesopotamia, to East<br />\nAfrica and to France; there is<br />\nwar hospital work in England and<br />\nin France; and there is finally<br />\nthe American ambulance work in<br />\nthe French Army on the western<br />\nfront and in the Balkans.<br />\nThe Rhodes trustees have allowed men to spend as much time<br />\nas they wish in activities of this<br />\nkind;, they will grant leave for<br />\nsuch things whenever it is asked.<br />\nOpportunities of this kind will<br />\nnot come again for us of the present generation. \u2022 The Rhodes<br />\nscholarship, while offering less<br />\npleasure to the prospective scholar, is, in my mind, of no less value<br />\nas an opportunity, for study, and<br />\nof far greater value in the experiences to which it opens the<br />\ndoor.<br />\n<br />\n\"Oh yes, you had a year of the<br />\nreal Oxford, but it's all broken<br />\nup now, isn't it?\" is what people<br />\nhave often said to me since my<br />\nreturn 'after completing my three<br />\nyears as a Rhodes scholar. That<br />\nis perfectly true; Oxford is<br />\nbroken up, at present, but that<br />\nfact does not prevent the Rhodes<br />\nscholarship from being worth while.<br />\nIndeed, in my opinion and in the<br />\nopinion of many Rhodes scholars,<br />\nthe experience of being in England during the war is worth<br />\nmore than the experience of living at Oxford under normal conditions.<br />\nAt present, instead of its normal 3,500 students, Oxford has<br />\nabout 600 undergraduates. Many<br />\nof her professors and instructors<br />\nare engaged in war work, and the<br />\nordinary social life of the university is dead. What then is there<br />\nto make it worth while for the<br />\nman who has not got time to lose<br />\nsightseeing instead of getting his<br />\nlife-work under way? First, the<br />\ncourses of study are still going<br />\non. There *re fewer instructors,<br />\nbut there are fewer students.<br />\nAnd the man who is going in for<br />\nhistory, classics, law, science, engineering, medicine or theology<br />\nwill find courses open for him as<br />\nbefore, and tutors who are able to<br />\ngive him more time perhaps than<br />\nthey could before. As far as study<br />\ngoes, therefore, the war has not<br />\nmade tile Oxford course of less<br />\nvalue than it was.<br />\nThe great advantage of being<br />\nin England at this time, however,<br />\nconsists in living in a country<br />\nCHIROPODIST AND MASSAUE<br />\nwhich has undertaken to carry<br />\nby<br />\nwar<br />\nNever Closed<br />\non its share in a world<br />\ntransforming its fundamental soEQUITABLE BUILDING<br />\ncial fabric, in a country which<br />\nCalvert and Fayette Streets<br />\nhas turned from inefficient social<br />\norganization to meet attack from<br />\nthe most highly organized of nations, in a country which boasted<br />\nGuilford and Thirty-First<br />\nof its free institutions and which<br />\nis now defending these institu- CIGARS, CIGARETTES & TOBACCO<br />\ntions by organizing its whole reCANDY<br />\nMAGAZINES<br />\nsources.

That is the all-important question of daylight practice, the lack of which has been<br />\nresponsible more than anything<br />\nelse for the defeats of Hopkins<br />\non the gridiron. The Black and<br />\nBlue will never, as long as her<br />\nfootball team is, forced to practice after sundown by artificial<br />\nlight, rise above her present<br />\nstandards. She will continue, in<br />\nspite of all the coaches in the<br />\nworld, to be outclassed by 'small,<br />\ninferior teams from colleges that<br />\nare unheard of outside the State.<br />\nDaylight practice is absolutely<br />\nessential for a successful team.<br />\nHow, then, can daylight practice<br />\nbe secured? Two methods have<br />\nbeen generally suggested: One is<br />\nto change the time of laboratory<br />\nwork until later in the afternoon<br />\nand have practice in the middle<br />\nof the day, and the other method<br />\nis to start classes earlier in the<br />\nmorning. The first method would<br />\nput too much of the burden on<br />\nthe instructors who also teach in<br />\nthe night school, and would also<br />\nmean that the quality oflaboratory<br />\nwork done by the football men<br />\nwould be perceptibly lowered. No<br />\none is in condition to do accurate<br />\nwork in the laboratory after a<br />\nhard scrimmage.<br />\nOn the other hand, if classes<br />\nwere started at 8.30, or earlier if<br />\nnecessary, every one in the University would share the burden<br />\nequally. By starting at 8.30 in<br />\nthe morning, with all the laboratories at Homewood, the team<br />\ncould be on the field for practice<br />\nat 4 o'clock; and if the men are<br />\nallowed to make up laboratory<br />\nwork on Saturdays and during<br />\nvacant periods, most of the foot-<br />\n<br />\nSTRATTON<br />\n<br />\nLEFRANC & AULT<br />\n<br />\n\"SHIRT SHOP\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Chas.

Moreover, all the members of the corps<br />\nwho are over eighteen years old<br />\nand are physically capable would<br />\nprobably receive non - commissioned offices in the Army and<br />\nwould immediately set about<br />\ntraining recruits.<br />\nImmediately following a war<br />\ndeclaration, drills of the most<br />\nvigorous character would be held<br />\nevery day. Though at present all<br />\nthe drill hours are Spent in combat<br />\ndrill, in learning how to advance<br />\nas skirmishers and what to do in<br />\nthe various stages of attack, these<br />\nphases and the many more which<br />\ncharacterize the real battle would<br />\nbe taught and gone into more minutely. Every afternoon would<br />\nfind the companies advancing and<br />\nrushing in skirmish through the<br />\nsurrounding woods, solving tactical problems and performing every<br />\nact necessary in real combat.<br />\nUnfortunately for the battalion, Lieutenant Elliott, who has been<br />\ntaking his examinations for a<br />\ncaptain's commission during the<br />\nlast two weeks, would probably<br />\nbe ordered back to his regiment.<br />\nFirst Sergeant Friedlander would<br />\nalso probably be ordered back to<br />\nhis, and First Sergeant Evans<br />\nwould be put on recruiting duty.<br />\nThis would leave the battalion in<br />\nthe hands of Major Linton, who,<br />\nhowever, is able to carry on the<br />\ntraining most efficiently, as he<br />\nhas had much experience in military work.<br />\nOne hundred and seventy rifles<br />\nhave been shipped, for the battalion from Troy, N. Y., and will<br />\narrive as quickly as the railroads<br />\ncan bring them. They will be<br />\nkept in racks which are under<br />\nconstruction in the old gymnasium back of Carroll Mansion. As<br />\nmost of the drill hours in the last<br />\nmonth have been used in mastering the manual of arms, the battalion is ready to handle the guns<br />\nas soon as they appear.<br /><br />\n\"Resolved, That the trustees of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\npledge the loyal I support of the<br />\nUniversity to the Government of<br />\nthe United States in its plans for<br />\nnational defense.\"<br />\nThis is the resolution which the<br />\nHopkins Board of Trustees has<br />\nsent to President Wilson, as an<br />\nindication of the way in which the<br />\nUniversity will stand behind him<br />\nin case war with Germany is declared.<br />\nAt the same meeting that this<br />\nresolution was adopted, another,<br />\nmotion was passed which created<br />\na Hopkins Committee on Research<br />\nto act in co-operation with the<br />\nNational Council of Research recently appointed at the President's request by the National<br />\nCommittee of Science.<br />\nThe duty of the Hopkins committee will be to stimulate invention in methods of defense<br />\nand offense and to assist in the<br />\nindustrial mobilization of thecountry.<br />\nThe personnel of the committee<br />\nis as follows: The President of<br />\nthe University, the President of<br />\nthe Board of Trustees, Ira Remsen, Joseph S. Ames, Walter A.<br />\nBaetjer, J. C. W. Frazer, Jacob<br />\nH. Hollander,Walter Jones, Burton E. Livingston Harry F. Reid,<br />\nWilliam H.Welch, John B.Whitehead, Daniel Willard, Frederick<br />\nW. Wood and R. W. Wood.<br />\nJust what official steps the University would take in case war is<br />\ndeclared can not of course be predicted.. There seems to be little<br />\ndoubt in official quarters how'could<br />\never, that the Government<br />\ncall upon the University to do\u2022<br />\nanything within its power, at<br />\nwhatever sacrifice the act would<br />\nbe performed.<br />\nWhen questioned as to the possibility of the Senior Class being<br />\ngraduated a few months earlier,<br />\nin case war is declared and volunteers are called for, President<br />\nGoodnow said that such a matter<br />\nwould have to be determined by<br />\nthe faculty. His manner indicated, however, that the loyalty<br />\nof Hopkins students would not<br />\nnecessitate the sacrifice or postponement of their degrees.<br />\nIt is also probable that in<br />\ncase of war, the University labo-<br /><br />\nDr. Lorraine S. Hulburt has announced to a representative of<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER that plans for<br />\nthe cataloging of the University<br />\nalumni and students according to<br />\nthe parts which they could play<br />\nin time of war would be ready<br />\nfor announcement within 4 few<br />\ndays.<br />\nIn this catalogue, every one (A<br />\nthe four thousand Hopkins alumni, all the graduate students and<br />\nprobably at least the seniors and<br />\njuniors among the undergraduates will have appended to his<br />\nname the general lines along<br />\nwhich his education has been conducted and the position in which<br />\nhe could serve the Government<br />\nmost capably.<br />\nAs was announced in THE<br />\n'NEWS-LETTER last week, this work<br />\nis being carried on by Dr. Hulburt in connection with the Intercollegiate Intelligence Bureau.<br />\nThis bureau has for its aim the<br />\norganization of the potential resources of every important college<br />\nand university in the country.<br />\nThe work upon which Dr. Hulburt is now engaged is the determination of the most efficient<br />\nand at the same time the quickest<br />\nway of obtaining the desired information. Once that the investigation has been thoroughly<br />\nplanned, with prompt co-operation, the actual execution should<br />\ntake very little time.<br />\nThe list, when it has been compiled, will immediately be sent to<br />\nthe United States War Department. If war is declared it will<br />\ngive the Government valuable aid<br />\nin providing it with access to the<br />\nservices of thousands of highly<br />\ntrained men.<br />\nAt the present time it seems<br />\nprobable that there will be more<br />\nneed of physicists and chemists<br />\nthan of the men who have pursued<br />\nother branches of learning. The<br />\nlist, however, is to be comprehensive.<br /><br />\nActive plans are being carried<br />\nout at the Johns Hopkins Hospital for the formation of a base<br />\nhospital that would be placed at<br />\nthe disposal of the Government in<br />\nthe event of war. The Government is encouraging the organization of such hospital units in all<br />\nthe large medical schools and hospitals in the country. About<br />\nthirty of these have been formed,<br />\nof which Hopkins is listed as unit<br />\nNo. 18.<br />\nThe personnel of the staff in the<br />\nproposed unit and the equipment<br />\nbeing gathered at Hopkins are of<br />\nsuch a character as to mark Hopkins as one of the best base hospitals at the Government's disposal.<br />\nDr. Winford Smith is the director<br />\nof the organization and he has under him some of the most prominentphysicians and surgeons in the<br />\ncity. The staff is made up of doctors who are or have been connected with Hopkins.<br />\nIn addition to the doctors on<br />\nthe staff, there is a large reserve<br />\nlist of those who desire to offer<br />\ntheir services in time of war,<br />\nwhich will make it possible for<br />\nthe Hopkins unit to increase its<br />\nstaff in a great emergency, and to<br />\nkeep its ranks always full of competent physicians.<br />\nThe staff is divided into three<br />\ngroups: The surgeons, the physicians and the laboratory workers.<br />\nDr. J. M. T. Finney is the chief<br />\nof the surgical division and he has<br />\nunder him specialists in the various lines of surgery. Dr. Janeway has charge of the physicians,<br />\nand Dr. Boggs of the laboratory<br />\ndivision. There are also in the<br />\nunit two dentists, fifty trained<br />\nnurses, twenty-five nurses' aids<br />\nwho are trained in Red Cross<br />\nwork, an adjutant, a quartermaster, a registrar, a chaplain and a<br />\nstaff of about eighty orderlies,<br />\nstretcher bearers, cooks, waiters,<br />\ncarpenters, electricians, maids,<br />\nclerks and stenographers.<br />\nWith the staff of doctors enlisted up to Government requirements, the only problem that now<br />\nremains is the raising of funds for<br />\nratories would be put at the com- the purchase of equipment. The remand, of the Government to carry quired number of bandages, beds,<br />\nout whatever work is needed. In bed linen, surgical dressings, etc.,<br />\nthe words of President Goodnow, have already been procured and<br />\n\"Johns Hopkins is ready to serve are packed for shipment to the<br />\nits country with every resource region of hostilities at a moment's<br />\nthat it commands.\"<br />\n(Continued on page 3, col. 2)<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MARCH 19, 1917.<br /><br />\nThe Hosiery Shop<br />\nBaltimore's Only Exclusive Hosiery Shop<br />\nfor Men<br /><br />\n215 N.

It must be a<br />\nsource of gratification to every<br />\nHopkins man that the University<br />\nis not resting content with protestations of loyalty, but is making ready to prove its patriotism<br />\nin ways undeniably convincing.<br />\nThe time has gone by for vain<br />\nmoralizing over the ways of the<br />\nworld\u2014we are facing facts. There<br />\nare certain concepts which must<br />\nbe defended at whatever cost\u2014<br />\nhighest among them, the concept<br />\nof international law. If we make<br />\nwar, we make it in the name of<br />\nrighteousness, nor will our claim<br />\nbe but the gloss of imperialistic<br />\nambitions; if we fight, it can be<br />\nsaid in the truest sense that we<br />\nfight, not for ourselves, but for<br />\nhumanity\u2014for the ideal of a law<br />\nhigher than the will of nations.<br />\nIf we are to defend that ideal, we<br /><br />\nHopkins undergraduates seldom<br />\nrecognize the fact that, as a class,<br />\nthey are under the constant necessity of justifying their existence.<br />\nThe University, primarily, is a<br />\ngraduate institution\u2014the collegiate department was originally<br />\ncreated only to fill up the gaps in.<br />\nthe graduate students' education.<br />\nTimes have changed since 1876; it<br />\nis a far cry from the University<br />\nof those days, with its humble<br />\nquarters and its few score students, to the Hopkins of today,<br />\nlocated in the magnificent new<br />\nbuildings and having a total enrollment of almost 2,500. Yet the<br />\nfact remains that the reputation<br />\nof the University was built and is<br />\nbeing preserved through the work<br />\ndone in its graduate departments.<br />\nFor that reason, the position of<br />\nthe Hopkins undergraduate is a<br />\npeculiar one. Viewed from the<br />\nstandpoint of President Gilman,<br />\nhe might very easily be judged an<br />\nanomaly. Good as the collegiate<br />\ndepartment undeniably is, it has<br />\ngrown up as a subsidiary branch<br />\nof the University \u2014 occupying a<br />\nplace entirely unique in the history of American education. The<br />\nreason why Hopkins was worldknoww ten years after its foundation was that its initial aim had<br />\nbeen to train its students in the<br />\nhighest forms of research. There<br />\nwere already many institutions in<br />\nwhich a collegiate education was<br />\nvery adequately given \u2014 Hopking<br />\ninaugurated a new era in the history of American universities in<br />\nthat it refused to devote itself to<br />\nthe training of college men, confining its attention to the development of scholars. The only excuse for the building up of the collegiate department was that it fulfilled a local need and acted as<br />\na pecuniary feeder without interfering with the high standard of<br />\nthe graduate work.<br />\nThere are two courses which a<br />\ncollege situated in such a position can follow. The first is to<br />\nturn out men who, while college<br />\nmen, are peculiarly products of<br /><br />\nthe University, men who differ as have\u2014much less, their ideal havradically from the average type ing once been fixed, a discussion<br />\nof A.

If the former, then it is<br />\nright to prepare. Only the strong<br />\nwill survive, and nations must_<br />\nfight for their existence.\"<br />\nDr. Hill said America should<br />\nsupport the 'entente allies' ideal,<br />\ndeclaring they have appealed to<br />\nthe, conscience of mankind in recognizing that imperialism is not<br />\nmerely a sort of harmless national<br />\npride, but a real spirit and creed.<br />\nIn sUpport of this statement, he<br />\nread excerpts from several inflammatory pamphlets spread<br />\nthrough Central Europe by the<br />\npan-Germanists before the war. \u2022<br />\nLong before the outbreak of the<br />\npresent war and even as.far back<br />\nas 1885, the more radical element<br />\nin Germany were apparently lusting for world dominion, Dr. Hill<br />\nsaid. He cited the predictions of<br />\na German writer of that date who<br />\nhad constructed maps of a worldwide Teutonic empire and. told<br />\nhow it could be acquired. Among<br />\nother things, France was to cede<br />\nlarge portions of her eastern front<br />\nand to pay a huge indeninity. The<br />\nseizure of Cuba and the Philippines was also part of the plan.<br />\nCuba seemed an ideal point from<br />\nwhich to dominate the Gulf of<br />\nMexico and to establish a closer<br />\nconnection with the ten million<br />\nGermans in America.<br />\n\"And, although I do not assert<br />\nthat these ideals were held by the<br />\nrulers of Germany,\" Dr Hill con. eluded, \"it is nevertheless a sign i hcant fact that 90 percent. of it<br />\nhas been, at least temporarily,<br />\ncarried out since 1914.\"<br />\nThe next lecture by Dr. Hill was<br />\ngiven (in'March\u202215 on \"The Transfiguration of thi\u00eaGCiiiia\u00f1 Empire.\"<br /><br />\n1920 Elects Captains and Managers.<br /><br />\nThe 1920 Class held a special<br />\nmeeting on Thursday in the lecture hall of the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding and elected the captains<br />\nand manager of the spring teams.<br />\nHoward Knipp, brother of \"Johnny\" Knipp; captain of the 'Varsity twelve, was chosen as leader<br />\nof the lAcrosse team.

Peace can only come when<br />\nit is imposed by the conqueror.<br /><br />\nThis is the claim and the boast-of Germany.\"<br />\nDr. Hill then called up a vision<br />\nof Germany as she used to be\u2014<br />\nGermany, the teacher of science,<br />\nof art, of niusic, of literature.<br />\nThe new Germany, he said, desires a union with Austria that<br />\nwill cement the two into one powerful nation, fortified from the<br />\ntest of the world. The sthall<br />\nstates, according to Germany's<br />\nidea, would soon be frightened<br />\ninto adherance to the Central<br />\nPowers, as that would be their<br />\nonly means of. securing protection<br />\nand peace.<br />\n\"In all the German ideals,\" he<br />\ncontinued, \"there is no proposal<br />\nto restore peace, and no reference<br />\nto neutrals, except to say that<br />\nsmall states can not remain aloof,<br />\nbut must seek entrance into the<br />\nCentral Powers. In expressing<br />\nthis idea in one of his books, Dr.<br />\nNauman significantly remarks<br />\nthat all treaties with small states<br />\nmay not be respected.\"<br />\n\"According to German writers,\"<br />\nthe lecturer added sarcastically,<br />\n\"these ideals and aims for German dominion of most of Europe,<br />\n\u2022if not of the world,\u2022did not antedate the war, and did not enter<br />\ninto the causes of the war.\"<br />\nThere will be two more lectures<br />\nby Dr. Hill\u2014one on -March 20 on<br />\n\"The Visions of a CoMmonwealth\"<br />\nand the other on March 22 on<br />\n\"Internat ional Organization.\"<br /><br />\nD.%\u2022<br /><br />\n-SC<br /><br />\nThe 20th Century<br />\nway of writing<br />\npersonally<br /><br />\nTwo's company, three's a crowd in private correspondence.<br />\nCome in and be convinced that<br /><br />\nCORONA<br /><br />\nThe Personal Writing Machine<br />\nenables you to type your private writing without anyone's aid<br />\nas aEcurately,cleanly and readably as can any trained typist.<br /><br />\nM.

NILES<br /><br />\nthough now far advanced, is not<br />\ncomplete, and it will be the privilege of the new Rhodes scholars<br />\nto witness not only its final<br />\nstages,but also to see the stupendous work of reconstruction which<br />\nmust inevitably follow the declaration of peace. To see these<br />\nthings and to be almost a part<br />\nof them is, to my mind, of infinitely more value than to spend three<br />\npleasant years of normal Oxford<br />\nlife.<br />\nBesides the great opportunities<br />\nfor observation, there are for<br />\nRho des scholars innumerable<br />\nchances to help, to do their bit<br />\nfor people who need help. There<br />\nis the Belgian Relief Commission; there is social work in England left by those who have gone<br />\nto the front; there is the Y. M. C.<br />\nA. with the British Army, work<br />\nthat has taken Rhodes scholars<br />\nto India, to Mesopotamia, to East<br />\nAfrica and to France; there is<br />\nwar hospital work in England and<br />\nin France; and there is finally<br />\nthe American ambulance work in<br />\nthe French Army on the western<br />\nfront and in the Balkans.<br />\nThe Rhodes trustees have allowed men to spend as much time<br />\nas they wish in activities of this<br />\nkind;, they will grant leave for<br />\nsuch things whenever it is asked.<br />\nOpportunities of this kind will<br />\nnot come again for us of the present generation. \u2022 The Rhodes<br />\nscholarship, while offering less<br />\npleasure to the prospective scholar, is, in my mind, of no less value<br />\nas an opportunity, for study, and<br />\nof far greater value in the experiences to which it opens the<br />\ndoor.<br /><br />\n\"Oh yes, you had a year of the<br />\nreal Oxford, but it's all broken<br />\nup now, isn't it?\" is what people<br />\nhave often said to me since my<br />\nreturn 'after completing my three<br />\nyears as a Rhodes scholar. That<br />\nis perfectly true; Oxford is<br />\nbroken up, at present, but that<br />\nfact does not prevent the Rhodes<br />\nscholarship from being worth while.<br />\nIndeed, in my opinion and in the<br />\nopinion of many Rhodes scholars,<br />\nthe experience of being in England during the war is worth<br />\nmore than the experience of living at Oxford under normal conditions.<br />\nAt present, instead of its normal 3,500 students, Oxford has<br />\nabout 600 undergraduates. Many<br />\nof her professors and instructors<br />\nare engaged in war work, and the<br />\nordinary social life of the university is dead. What then is there<br />\nto make it worth while for the<br />\nman who has not got time to lose<br />\nsightseeing instead of getting his<br />\nlife-work under way? First, the<br />\ncourses of study are still going<br />\non. There *re fewer instructors,<br />\nbut there are fewer students.<br />\nAnd the man who is going in for<br />\nhistory, classics, law, science, engineering, medicine or theology<br />\nwill find courses open for him as<br />\nbefore, and tutors who are able to<br />\ngive him more time perhaps than<br />\nthey could before. As far as study<br />\ngoes, therefore, the war has not<br />\nmade tile Oxford course of less<br />\nvalue than it was.<br />\nThe great advantage of being<br />\nin England at this time, however,<br />\nconsists in living in a country<br />\nCHIROPODIST AND MASSAUE<br />\nwhich has undertaken to carry<br />\nby<br />\nwar<br />\nNever Closed<br />\non its share in a world<br />\ntransforming its fundamental soEQUITABLE BUILDING<br />\ncial fabric, in a country which<br />\nCalvert and Fayette Streets<br />\nhas turned from inefficient social<br />\norganization to meet attack from<br />\nthe most highly organized of nations, in a country which boasted<br />\nGuilford and Thirty-First<br />\nof its free institutions and which<br />\nis now defending these institu- CIGARS, CIGARETTES &amp; TOBACCO<br />\ntions by organizing its whole reCANDY<br />\nMAGAZINES<br />\nsources.

That is the all-important question of daylight practice, the lack of which has been<br />\nresponsible more than anything<br />\nelse for the defeats of Hopkins<br />\non the gridiron. The Black and<br />\nBlue will never, as long as her<br />\nfootball team is, forced to practice after sundown by artificial<br />\nlight, rise above her present<br />\nstandards. She will continue, in<br />\nspite of all the coaches in the<br />\nworld, to be outclassed by 'small,<br />\ninferior teams from colleges that<br />\nare unheard of outside the State.<br />\nDaylight practice is absolutely<br />\nessential for a successful team.<br />\nHow, then, can daylight practice<br />\nbe secured? Two methods have<br />\nbeen generally suggested: One is<br />\nto change the time of laboratory<br />\nwork until later in the afternoon<br />\nand have practice in the middle<br />\nof the day, and the other method<br />\nis to start classes earlier in the<br />\nmorning. The first method would<br />\nput too much of the burden on<br />\nthe instructors who also teach in<br />\nthe night school, and would also<br />\nmean that the quality oflaboratory<br />\nwork done by the football men<br />\nwould be perceptibly lowered. No<br />\none is in condition to do accurate<br />\nwork in the laboratory after a<br />\nhard scrimmage.<br />\nOn the other hand, if classes<br />\nwere started at 8.30, or earlier if<br />\nnecessary, every one in the University would share the burden<br />\nequally. By starting at 8.30 in<br />\nthe morning, with all the laboratories at Homewood, the team<br />\ncould be on the field for practice<br />\nat 4 o'clock; and if the men are<br />\nallowed to make up laboratory<br />\nwork on Saturdays and during<br />\nvacant periods, most of the foot-<br /><br />\nSTRATTON<br /><br />\nLEFRANC &amp; AULT<br /><br />\n\"SHIRT SHOP\"<br /><br />\nThe Chas.
