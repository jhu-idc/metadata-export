It is proposed to insure the games with Virginia.<br />\nMaryland, St. John's and Washington and Lee for ten thousand dollars each. The insurance is payable upon the fall of one-tenth of<br />\nan inch of rain between 10 A. M.<br />\nand 2 P. M. on the day of the<br />\ngame. The premiums of all four<br />\npolicies amount to thirty-three hundred dollars.<br />\nAt a meeting of the Varsity Club<br />\nheld in June, Mr. Horace Burroughs, Jr., '89, was elected president.

Their inventions<br />\nhave the quality of usefulness, of reliability, of<br />\nproductability; which is an involved way, perhaps, of saying that they have the primary<br />\nrequisite of all really great inventions:<br />\nServiceability.<br />\nEngineering history abounds in instances of<br />\nnear-genius that produced no product, and of<br />\ngreat developments that never reached completion; and most of these instances are explained<br />\nby the lack, somewhere in the system, of that<br />\nability to give real Service.<br />\nService, in a machine or a system, or wherever<br />\nyou find it, is not there by accident but because<br />\nit was incorporated by men who understood<br />\nwhat was required and knew how to provide it.<br />\nMuch more is required of the designer than<br />\nfacility in calculation and mastery of theory.<br />\nHe must have first hand and thorough familiarity<br />\nwith manufacturing operations and with commercial and operating conditions. It takes more<br />\nthan mere ingenuity and inventiveness to design<br />\napparatus that will be really serviceable and<br />\nwill \"stay put.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe design engineer, in the Westinghouse<br />\nplan, is responsible for the performance of the<br />\nfinished product. He cannot possibly have the<br />\nproper understanding of operation unless he operates and tests, unless he spends time and thought<br />\nin investigation and study, not in the laboratory<br />\nor drawing room, but right on the operating<br />\njob. Here, most of his ideas will develop; and<br />\nhere he will see and prepare for all the different<br />\nthings which the product will later have to<br />\nencounter. Then when he comes to put his<br />\ncreations on paper, his calculations will be<br />\nnecessary and helpful to check the conclusions<br />\nwhich he has reached, and this right use of them<br />\nrequires training and a high degree of understanding.

Their inventions<br />\nhave the quality of usefulness, of reliability, of<br />\nproductability; which is an involved way, perhaps, of saying that they have the primary<br />\nrequisite of all really great inventions:<br />\nServiceability.<br />\nEngineering history abounds in instances of<br />\nnear-genius that produced no product, and of<br />\ngreat developments that never reached completion; and most of these instances are explained<br />\nby the lack, somewhere in the system, of that<br />\nability to give real Service.<br />\nService, in a machine or a system, or wherever<br />\nyou find it, is not there by accident but because<br />\nit was incorporated by men who understood<br />\nwhat was required and knew how to provide it.<br />\nMuch more is required of the designer than<br />\nfacility in calculation and mastery of theory.<br />\nHe must have first hand and thorough familiarity<br />\nwith manufacturing operations and with commercial and operating conditions. It takes more<br />\nthan mere ingenuity and inventiveness to design<br />\napparatus that will be really serviceable and<br />\nwill \"stay put.\"<br /><br />\nThe design engineer, in the Westinghouse<br />\nplan, is responsible for the performance of the<br />\nfinished product. He cannot possibly have the<br />\nproper understanding of operation unless he operates and tests, unless he spends time and thought<br />\nin investigation and study, not in the laboratory<br />\nor drawing room, but right on the operating<br />\njob. Here, most of his ideas will develop; and<br />\nhere he will see and prepare for all the different<br />\nthings which the product will later have to<br />\nencounter. Then when he comes to put his<br />\ncreations on paper, his calculations will be<br />\nnecessary and helpful to check the conclusions<br />\nwhich he has reached, and this right use of them<br />\nrequires training and a high degree of understanding.
