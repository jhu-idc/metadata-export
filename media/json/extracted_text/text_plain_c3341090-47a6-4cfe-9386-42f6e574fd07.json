In previous seasons a<br />\nsuperhuman showing against Yale or a remarkable record against<br />\na number of the East's leading teams has caused Maryland to be<br />\nthe overwhelming favorite. This year the situation is somewhat<br />\ndifferent.<br />\nDespite the great advantage on paper that had been conceded<br />\nto the Ravens, Maryland's margin of supremacy for the past<br />\nfour years has been only one field goal. Hopkins has played the<br />\nsort of football that Yale exhibited in the last ten minutes of the<br />\nPrinceton game last Saturday. The sixty minutes were not only<br />\na football game, but an immortal struggle.<br />\nLast year:however, with a lead of two touchdowns in the first<br />\nhalf, the team was not able to resist the onslaughts of one Mike<br />\nStevens, and victory glimmered out of sight in the last few<br />\nmoments of play. Some have said that the team was so intoxicated with its unexpected lead that the bubble was bound to<br />\nburst in the second half. Be that as it may, however, we have<br />\njust one word to say: Forget that the two teams are supposed<br />\nto be evenly matched. Maryland against Hopkins will no more<br />\nbe the same Maryland that played Virginia than Hopkins will<br />\nbe the same Hopkins that played Richmond. It will be nearly<br />\nour last chance to end a football season with a glorious gesture:<br />\nBeat Maryland!<br />\n<br />\nE. E.

If a man represents the University on an athletic<br />\nteam and performs creditably enough to win the award given to<br />\nmembers of that team, he -has certainly done his share towards<br />\nenhancing the athletic reputation of the college.<br />\nWhy, then, are members of a major sport team that does not<br />\nwin a majority of its games or meets granted membership in the<br />\nclub when minor sports athletes who may not lose a game or meet<br />\nall season are not members? Technically, it is true that crosscountry or tennis men are not H men, but they have, nevertheless,<br />\nrepresented Hopkins to the best of their ability.

In this play the poetical side<br />\nis uppermost to the detriment of the<br />\nrealistic. But in \"Richard II\" he<br />\nreturns to realism. Then in \"Henry<br />\nIV\" in the creation of Falstaff the<br />\npoetical side is expressed intensely.<br />\nHere was a triumph in comic epic<br />\npoetry.

In previous seasons a<br />\nsuperhuman showing against Yale or a remarkable record against<br />\na number of the East's leading teams has caused Maryland to be<br />\nthe overwhelming favorite. This year the situation is somewhat<br />\ndifferent.<br />\nDespite the great advantage on paper that had been conceded<br />\nto the Ravens, Maryland's margin of supremacy for the past<br />\nfour years has been only one field goal. Hopkins has played the<br />\nsort of football that Yale exhibited in the last ten minutes of the<br />\nPrinceton game last Saturday. The sixty minutes were not only<br />\na football game, but an immortal struggle.<br />\nLast year:however, with a lead of two touchdowns in the first<br />\nhalf, the team was not able to resist the onslaughts of one Mike<br />\nStevens, and victory glimmered out of sight in the last few<br />\nmoments of play. Some have said that the team was so intoxicated with its unexpected lead that the bubble was bound to<br />\nburst in the second half. Be that as it may, however, we have<br />\njust one word to say: Forget that the two teams are supposed<br />\nto be evenly matched. Maryland against Hopkins will no more<br />\nbe the same Maryland that played Virginia than Hopkins will<br />\nbe the same Hopkins that played Richmond.

In this play the poetical side<br />\nis uppermost to the detriment of the<br />\nrealistic. But in \"Richard II\" he<br />\nreturns to realism. Then in \"Henry<br />\nIV\" in the creation of Falstaff the<br />\npoetical side is expressed intensely.<br />\nHere was a triumph in comic epic<br />\npoetry. But in \"Henry V\" he combined the epic quality of \"Richard<br />\nIII\" with the realistic quality of<br />\n\"Henry IV\" in a supreme poetical<br />\nachievement.<br />\nAbout 1600, as M. Feuillerat said,<br />\nShakespeare reached the height of<br />\nhis ability to combine poetry and<br />\ndrama. Then, after being influenced for a while by Ben Jonson's<br />\nbitterly realistic comedies, he returned to truly poetical drama in<br />\nthe almost legendary plays, \"Macbeth,\" \"Othello,\" \"Hamlet\" and<br />\n\"King Lear.\" These, although much<br />\nlike the histories, furnished far<br />\nwider opportunity for poetical<br />\ntreatment. In them he achieved his<br />\ngreatest success, developing his idea<br />\nof the higher purposes of the drama.<br />\nIn this group the poetical element is<br />\nbest seen in \"King Lear,\" a work<br />\nof true poetry combined with moving realism.<br /><br />\nYELLOW<br /><br />\nCAB<br /><br />\nAdvance Showing of<br />\nEs.<br />\n`Z.)<br /><br />\ntet5on Ciothe5<br /><br />\nfor FALL<br /><br />\nbr-m<br /><br />\n$292&amp; $34.50<br /><br />\nF the profs find it<br />\nhard to read your hieroglyphics, they really can't<br />\nbe blamed if they give you<br />\nlower marks than you may<br />\nthink you deserve.<br />\nTake no chances.
