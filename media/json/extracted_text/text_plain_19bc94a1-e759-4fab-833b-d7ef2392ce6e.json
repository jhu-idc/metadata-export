Those few who have followed their exploits<br />\nfor the last two seasons have wondered what happened to the<br />\nboys who had such great promise last year and now are<br />\nbogging down.<br />\nBoth losses have been by the slim margin of two points against<br />\nteams that rank very well nationally. Perhaps some small change<br />\ncould mean the difference between victory and defeat.<br />\nThe first question that comes to mind is just why does a person<br />\ngo out for cross country when he is faced with a little more than<br />\nknocking himself out on the four mile course. No member of the<br />\nteam could give me an answer. No one seems to be running for<br />\ncredit or glory but purely for the love of running. No crowds<br />\nsit in the stands and cheer them along except at the times they<br />\nare featured as a side show to a football game. Then a few cheer<br />\nthe winners for the 300 yards of their four mile tour.<br />\nYet, unheralded by the school at large, each year there is a<br />\ngood turnout for cross country. There is definitely a high spirit<br />\namong the members of the squad which surprised me when I<br />\nlearned of the conditions under which they have to train.<br />\nA team that doesn't receive its rewards for runing from the<br />\ncrowd certainly should have the privilege of good meet conditions.<br />\nSo far this year, however, Carl Rees, coach of the team, has been<br />\nsent on football duties each week that the gridders played away<br />\nfrom home.<br />\nThe job of a coach at a meet away from home is particularly<br />\nImportant. When the team is running on an unfamiliar course a<br />\nspotter along the way can be of great aid in winning a meet.<br />\nHe can point out to the team members how they are doing in the<br />\nrace and give them a quick word of advice as to how they could<br />\npick up on the man in front of them. Without the spotters, a<br />\nrunner might make his bid at the wrong time and as a result end<br />\nup one or more places lower than he could have had he had someone to give him a word along the way.<br />\nAn excellent example of this was the triangular meet between<br />\nHopkins, Haverford and Franklin & Marshall at Lancaster. Most<br />\nof the Jay squad had never run over the course before, and<br />\nwith the unusually large field things were very confusing. The<br />\nother two colleges had men along the way to give their team<br />\ninformation but Hopkins had no one.<br />\nAnother point which has been brought up recently in defense<br />\nof losing Hopkins teams is the long trip on busses that the squads<br />\nhave to make before the games. The cross country team isn't even<br />\ngiven a small bus to ride on, but the nine man squad is jammed<br />\ninto a seven passenger car and sent off.<br />\nThis leaves a school like Hopkins with its policy of equal<br />\nemphasis on all sports in a very strange position. At present there<br />\nare five full time coaches in the athletic department. Of these,<br />\nfour seem to be coaching football, although there are only two<br />\nfootball teams, the varsity and the freshman squads. At a big<br />\nuniversity where all emphasis is put on football, and where<br />\nscholarships are offered to make sure that the team is a good one it<br />\nwouldn't make any difference whether this was true or not. However, Hopkins, at every chance .available, boasts of the way it has<br />\nperfected a program whereby each student may find a complete<br />\nsports program in whatever field he chooses be it varsity, freshman,<br />\nor intramural competition.<br />\nIt seems apparent, that if what I have stated here is true,<br />\nneither the varsity nor the freshman cross country team is<br />\ngetting the full attention that it deserves. Another team which also<br />\nis not getting the coaching that it should have is the freshman<br />\nsoccer team. Wilson Fewster is doing an admirable job with the<br />\nvarsity team as its record indicates, but he isn't a superman. He<br />\ncertainly cannot be expected to handle the varsity and frosh<br />\nunassisted and do a good job with both. Out of necessity, therefore, the freshman team has been shunted off with a word of<br />\ninstruction to the captains, who then, to the best of their ability,<br />\ncoach the yearlings. Porto Sergio, a graduate student, who<br />\nworked out with the varsity at the beginning of the season has<br />\nbeen helping Fewster out with the frosh. With the heavy work<br />\nthat he is forced to do in his doctorate training, however, he can<br />\nspend only a couple of days a week with the frosh.<br />\nSomething should be done to correct these errors. Despite<br />\nHopkins' small athletic budget, if the school wants its sports<br />\nprogram to remain truly the ideal of athletic systems, they should<br />\nspend a little money to influence a graduate student or perhaps a<br />\nformer Hopkins athlete working in the Baltimore area who have<br />\nthe time to come out and help with the freshman teams.

Those few who have followed their exploits<br />\nfor the last two seasons have wondered what happened to the<br />\nboys who had such great promise last year and now are<br />\nbogging down.<br />\nBoth losses have been by the slim margin of two points against<br />\nteams that rank very well nationally. Perhaps some small change<br />\ncould mean the difference between victory and defeat.<br />\nThe first question that comes to mind is just why does a person<br />\ngo out for cross country when he is faced with a little more than<br />\nknocking himself out on the four mile course. No member of the<br />\nteam could give me an answer. No one seems to be running for<br />\ncredit or glory but purely for the love of running. No crowds<br />\nsit in the stands and cheer them along except at the times they<br />\nare featured as a side show to a football game. Then a few cheer<br />\nthe winners for the 300 yards of their four mile tour.<br />\nYet, unheralded by the school at large, each year there is a<br />\ngood turnout for cross country. There is definitely a high spirit<br />\namong the members of the squad which surprised me when I<br />\nlearned of the conditions under which they have to train.<br />\nA team that doesn't receive its rewards for runing from the<br />\ncrowd certainly should have the privilege of good meet conditions.<br />\nSo far this year, however, Carl Rees, coach of the team, has been<br />\nsent on football duties each week that the gridders played away<br />\nfrom home.<br />\nThe job of a coach at a meet away from home is particularly<br />\nImportant. When the team is running on an unfamiliar course a<br />\nspotter along the way can be of great aid in winning a meet.<br />\nHe can point out to the team members how they are doing in the<br />\nrace and give them a quick word of advice as to how they could<br />\npick up on the man in front of them. Without the spotters, a<br />\nrunner might make his bid at the wrong time and as a result end<br />\nup one or more places lower than he could have had he had someone to give him a word along the way.<br />\nAn excellent example of this was the triangular meet between<br />\nHopkins, Haverford and Franklin &amp; Marshall at Lancaster. Most<br />\nof the Jay squad had never run over the course before, and<br />\nwith the unusually large field things were very confusing. The<br />\nother two colleges had men along the way to give their team<br />\ninformation but Hopkins had no one.<br />\nAnother point which has been brought up recently in defense<br />\nof losing Hopkins teams is the long trip on busses that the squads<br />\nhave to make before the games. The cross country team isn't even<br />\ngiven a small bus to ride on, but the nine man squad is jammed<br />\ninto a seven passenger car and sent off.<br />\nThis leaves a school like Hopkins with its policy of equal<br />\nemphasis on all sports in a very strange position. At present there<br />\nare five full time coaches in the athletic department. Of these,<br />\nfour seem to be coaching football, although there are only two<br />\nfootball teams, the varsity and the freshman squads. At a big<br />\nuniversity where all emphasis is put on football, and where<br />\nscholarships are offered to make sure that the team is a good one it<br />\nwouldn't make any difference whether this was true or not. However, Hopkins, at every chance .available, boasts of the way it has<br />\nperfected a program whereby each student may find a complete<br />\nsports program in whatever field he chooses be it varsity, freshman,<br />\nor intramural competition.<br />\nIt seems apparent, that if what I have stated here is true,<br />\nneither the varsity nor the freshman cross country team is<br />\ngetting the full attention that it deserves. Another team which also<br />\nis not getting the coaching that it should have is the freshman<br />\nsoccer team. Wilson Fewster is doing an admirable job with the<br />\nvarsity team as its record indicates, but he isn't a superman. He<br />\ncertainly cannot be expected to handle the varsity and frosh<br />\nunassisted and do a good job with both. Out of necessity, therefore, the freshman team has been shunted off with a word of<br />\ninstruction to the captains, who then, to the best of their ability,<br />\ncoach the yearlings. Porto Sergio, a graduate student, who<br />\nworked out with the varsity at the beginning of the season has<br />\nbeen helping Fewster out with the frosh. With the heavy work<br />\nthat he is forced to do in his doctorate training, however, he can<br />\nspend only a couple of days a week with the frosh.<br />\nSomething should be done to correct these errors. Despite<br />\nHopkins' small athletic budget, if the school wants its sports<br />\nprogram to remain truly the ideal of athletic systems, they should<br />\nspend a little money to influence a graduate student or perhaps a<br />\nformer Hopkins athlete working in the Baltimore area who have<br />\nthe time to come out and help with the freshman teams.
