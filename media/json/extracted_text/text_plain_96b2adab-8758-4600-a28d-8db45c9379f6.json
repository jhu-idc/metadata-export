The State\u2019s outlines are more particularly de-<br />\nscribed as follows: the famous Mason\u2019s and Dixon\u2019s<br />\nline bounds on the east and north, and begins at<br />\nCape Henlopen, the most eastern point of the At-<br />\nlantic coast (in Latitude 38\u00b0 274\u2019 North, being about<br />\ntwenty-three miles south of the point now called Cape<br />\nHenlopen), and running due west to a point midway<br />\nbetween the Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay;<br />\nthence by a line northerly (being 31\u00b0 west of north),<br />\ntangent to a circle of twelve miles around the Court-<br />\nHouse at New Castle, Delaware ; thence from the<br />\ntangent point northerly, bounding on the circumfer-<br />\nence of the circle until it intersects a line run due<br />\nnorth from said tangent point; and thence with this<br />\ndue north line till it intersects a line run due west<br />\nfrom a point fifteen miles south from the city of<br />\nPhiladelphia, as originally laid out. Thence with<br />\nthis due west line (this is the line more particularly<br />\nstyled Mason\u2019s and Dixon\u2019s line), to intersect a line<br />\nrun due north from the farthest source of the Poto-<br />\nmac river. This last due north line, as always held in<br />\npossession by the States of Virginia and Maryland,<br />\nand lately finally accepted as the line, is not run from<br />\nthe farthest source, but from the Fairfax stone at the<br />\nhead of the northern or shorter branch of* the Poto-<br />\nmac. Thence due south to the Fairfax stone, and<br />\nthence by the south bank of the Potomac river to<br />\nSmith\u2019s Point on the Chesapeake Bay (at the light-<br />\nhouse). From thence easterly to the most western<br />\npoint of Watkin\u2019s Point, on the eastern shore of the<br />\nChesapeake. From this point the line should run<br />\ndue east to the Ocean, but has lately been settled as<br />\nbounding on the north shore of Pocomoke Sound<br />\nand river, to the old line as found marked, and as<br />\ngenerally accepted in the neighborhood by titles<br />\nand otherwise, and thence on this old line to the<br />\nAtlantic. From this last point the State fronts on<br />\nthe Atlantic Ocean northerly to the place of begin-<br />\nning, enclosing an area of 10,979 square miles,<br />\nof which the Chesapeake Bay covers about 985<br />\nsquare miles, and other navigable waters about 1,000<br />\nmiles.<br />\n<br />\nThe stone at the northeast corner of Maryland<br />\nhaving been remcved, in 1849 a revision of the<br />\nsurvey made by Mason and Dixon was determined<br />\nupon.<br />\n<br />\n\" Commissioners were appointed by the States of<br />\nDelaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, who, with<br />\nthe aid of Colonel James D. Graham, verified in all<br />\nimportant points the work of their predecessors. A<br />\nslight change was made which increased by one<br />\nacre and eighty-seven one-hundredths the area of<br />\nMaryland.<br />\n<br />\nFACE OF THE COUNTRY.\u2014 The surface on<br />\nboth shores of Chesapeake Bay is level, and the soil<br />\ngenerally sandy. A range of hills enters the State<br />\nnear the Susquehanna, and extends in a southwesterly<br />\ndirection to the Potomac river, which it intersects<br />\n<br />\nabout ten miles above Washington city. This ridge<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\ndivides the alluvial or tide-water district from the<br />\nmountainous part of the State.<br />\n<br />\nThe tide-water district embraces nearly one-half<br />\nof the territory of the State, the surface being nearly<br />\nlevel, except in the northern part, and but slightly<br />\nelevated above the sea, and it is supposed to have<br />\nformed the bed of an ancient ocean. Beds of<br />\nmarl, shell lime, and green sand abound, making<br />\nits soil highly productive, when properly cultivated.<br />\nThe Atlantic coast of the \u00a2 Eastern Shore\u201d has no<br />\nharbors, and is bordered throughout by a sandy<br />\nbeach, from a few yards to more than a fourth of a<br />\nmile in breadth, enclosing a shallow lagoon, which,<br />\nowing to the blocking up of several passages by<br />\nwhich it formerly communicated with the sea, may<br />\nalmost be considered an inland lake. The surface of<br />\nthe eastern shore which forms part of the peninsula<br />\nlying between the Chesapeake and Delaware bays is<br />\nlow and level, except in the northern part, where it<br />\nis somewhat broken and hilly.<br />\n<br />\nIn the northern part of Worcester County and<br />\nextending across into Delaware, is a high table-land<br />\nknown as the \u00a2 Cypress Swamp,\u201d far the most ex-<br />\ntensive of the swamps of the State, having an area<br />\nof about 50,000 acres. The mountainous district<br />\noccupies the strip of territory (not more than four<br />\nmiles wide in its narrowest part) in the north-west<br />\npart of the State, between the Pennsylvania line and<br />\nthe Potomac river. It is crossed by different ridges<br />\nof the Alleghany Mountains, bearing different local<br />\nnames, such as South-east Mountain, Sugar Loaf<br />\nMountain, Catoctin, Blue Ridge, Kittatinny, Rugged<br />\nMountain, ete., none of which are of great elevation.<br />\nThis district, which embraces the counties of Car-<br />\nroll, Frederick, Washington, Alleghany, and Gar-<br />\nrett<(proposed), so far from being wild and uninhab-<br />\nitable, containg some of the finest roads and most<br />\ndesirable farms in the State, much of the region<br />\nbeing characterized by hills of moderate height,<br />\nwhose rounded summits are covered with verdure,<br />\nand the streams that intersect them have generally<br />\nabrupt banks, with small tracts of alluvial soil. One<br />\nof the finest valleys is the one known in Pennsylva-<br />\nnia as the \u201cCumberland Valley,\u201d in Maryland as<br />\nthe \u00a2 Iagerstown Valley,\u201d and in Virginia as the<br />\n\u201cShenandoah Valley.\u201d Tt has a rolling surface and<br />\nfertile soil resting upon \u00a2 Trenton limestone,\u201d which<br />\nis remarkable as containing all the great caverns in<br />\nthe country. Westward of this valley is a belt from<br />\nthirty to sixty miles wide of ridges of moderate<br />\nheight, with their included valleys, and the Alle-<br />\nghany ranges are reached in the county of that name.<br />\nThe mountains cross the State in long, parallel ridges,<br />\nfrequently some distance apart, and interspersed with<br />\nbroad level valleys, called \u00a2 glades,\u201d which are nat-<br />\nural meadows, for miles as flat as tide-water marshes,<br />\nand are covered with natural grass, without timber<br />\nor trees of any sort. The surface of the country<br />\nin this part of the State is generally rugged and<br />\nbroken, and much of it is still covered with the native<br />\nforest.<br />\n<br />\nRIVERS, BAYS, ETC. \u2014 The Potomac, which<br />\nconstitutes the boundary between Maryland and Vir-<br />\nginia, is formed by the north and south branches,<br />\nwhich unite about 20 miles south-east of Cumber-<br />\nland. It flows first north-east to Ilancock, passing<br />\nthrough several ridges of mountains, then pursues a<br />\nsouth-east direction, and receives from the right its<br />\nlargest affluent, the Shenandoah, just before its pas-<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\nsage through the Blue Ridge at Harper\u2019s Ferry.<br />\nFlowing thence south-east to within fourteen miles<br />\nabove Georgetown, it falls over the edge of the primi-<br />\ntive formation in one of the most interesting cataracts<br />\nin the U. States. The descent is about eighty feet<br />\nin one and a half miles, from thirty to forty feet of<br />\nwhich are in one perpendicular pitch. For some<br />\nfifty miles below Georgetown the general course of<br />\nthe river is south and south-west, after which it re-<br />\nsumes its general south-easterly course, expanding<br />\ninto an estuary some six or cight miles in width, and<br />\nempties into the Chesapeake Bay in about 88\u00b0 North<br />\nLatitude, and 76\u00b0 10\u2019 West Longitude. The entire<br />\nlength of the Potomac is about three hundred and<br />\nfifty miles. The tide ascends to Georgetown, in the<br />\nDistrict of Columbia, about one hundred and twenty<br />\nmiles from the mouth of the river, which is navi-<br />\ngable for the largest vessels to Washington city.<br />\n<br />\nMost of the streams flowing into the Potomac on<br />\nthe Maryland side are small. Wicomico River and<br />\nMattawoman Creek, in Charles Co., Anacostia River<br />\nand Rock Creek, near Washington, the Monocacy<br />\nRiver, in Frederick Co., and the Antietam River and<br />\nLicking Creek, in Washington Co., are the principal<br />\nones.<br />\n<br />\nThe Susquehanna river enters the State from<br />\nPennsylvania near the north-east corner, and, flow-<br />\ning in a south-easterly direction for fifteen miles,<br />\nempties into Chesapeake Bay at Havre-de-Grace.<br />\nThe main stream is about one hundred and fifty<br />\nmiles long, and has very unequal breadth, at some<br />\nplaces exceeding a mile, and at others less than one-<br />\nfourth of a mile. It is adorned by numerous beau-<br />\ntiful islands, and the channel is frequently obstructed<br />\nby rocky rapids, which prevent navigation in low<br />\nstages of water.<br />\n<br />\nThe Patuxent is the longest river, lying entirely<br />\nin Maryland. It rises about eighteen miles east of<br />\nFrederick city. Flowing in a south-easterly direction,<br />\nit forms the boundary between Montgomery, Prince<br />\nGeorge\u2019s, and Saint Mary\u2019s counties on the right,<br />\nand Howard, Anne Arundel, and Calvert counties<br />\non the left, and empties by an estuary two or three<br />\nmiles wide into Chesapeake Bay. The valley of this<br />\nriver is about ninety miles long, and is remarkably<br />\nnarrow. Small vessels ascend forty or fifty miles<br />\nfrom its month.<br />\n<br />\nThe entire waters of the State of Maryland flow<br />\ninto Chesapeake Bay, except a few small streams in<br />\nthe eastern part of Worcester County, which flow<br />\ninto Sinepuxent and Chincoteague bays, and the<br />\nYoughiogheny river and branches, which empty into<br />\nthe Monongahela and Ohio rivers.<br />\n<br />\nChesapeake, the largest bay in the United States,<br />\nenters Virginia between Cape Charles and Cape<br />\nHenry, in about Latitude 87\u00b0 N., and Longitude<br />\n76\u00b0 W., and extends into Maryland as far as 89\u00b0<br />\n86\" N. Latitude, and 76\u00b0 8\u2019 W. Longitude. The<br />\nlength is about two hundred miles, and the breadth<br />\nfrom four to forty miles. The distance from Cape<br />\nCharles to Cape Henry is about twelve miles,<br />\n<br />\nChesapeake Bay is remarkable for the extreme<br />\nirregularity of its coast-line, \u2014numerous bays and<br />\nestuaries are on either side, some of which serve as<br />\noutlets or reservoirs to the waters of the different<br />\nrivers of Maryland and Virginia, while others are<br />\nscarcely fed by any permanent stream, being nothing<br />\nmore than mere arms or projections from the sea.<br />\nThe depth of the bay is sufficient for the largest ships<br />\nto ascend nearly to the mouth of the Susquehanna.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "<br /><br />\n.qj<br />\n&amp;<br /><br /><br /><br />\n3<br />\n.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nT MRS oy s<br /><br />\nT T i DRI RB<br /><br />\nOMETIHEN e ST N ST T T s R T<br /><br />\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION.<br /><br />\nTOPOGRAPHY.<br /><br />\n\u20140-05 Q00\u2014<br /><br />\nOUNDARTES. \u2014 The State of Maryland lies be-<br />\ntween 87\u00b0 53\u2019 and 39\u00b0 43\u2019 18\" North Latitude,<br />\nand Longitude 1\u00b0 58\u2019 East, and 2\u00b0 30\u2019 West from the<br />\nCapitol at Washington, being bounded on the north<br />\nby the State of Pennsylvania, on the east by Dela-<br />\nware and the Atlantic Ocean, south and south-west<br />\nby Virginia, and south-west and west by West Vir-<br />\nginia.
