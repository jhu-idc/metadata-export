No more weekly<br />\nsummaries of Patty's alleged<br />\nactivities, no more Jack Scott<br />\ndenouncements of the FBI.<br />\nProbably most tragic is that we<br />\nwill never read a Patty cover<br />\nstory in People magazine.<br />\nAfter their trial, the notoriety<br />\nof the remaining SLA members<br />\nwill be reduced to something<br />\nakin to the\"update\" section in<br />\nmany periodicals. Imagine this:<br />\n\"And what ever happened to<br />\nPatricia Hearst, kidnapped heiress<br />\nwho denounced family and<br />\nfortune to join the Symbionese<br />\nLiberation Army back in 1974?<br />\nToday, ten years later, after<br />\nseveral unhappy marriages, Miss<br />\nHearst is living on the French<br />\nRiviera, sunning by day, dancing<br />\nby night. Asked about her<br />\ninvolvement with the SLA, Miss<br />\nHearst laughed heartily and said,<br />\n\"Oh that? Well, for me, it was<br />\njust a fling, one of those things,<br />\nYou- know how rich teenagers<br />\nalways want to see the other side<br />\nof the tracks. Anyway, it was an<br />\ninteresting way to live although<br />\nI wouldn't want to do it four<br />\nseasons a year. But actually,<br />\nsome of it was great fun.\"<br />\nYes, it's depressing that the<br />\nPatty Hearst saga is on the wane,<br />\nWith only press conferences,<br />\ntrials and appeals separating it<br />\nfrom mere history. But take<br />\nheart friends, now that Patty is in<br />\nthe grips of the law there is one<br />\nfinal story to tell. Last spring,<br />\nwhen the feds were scooping up<br />\nfingerprints in an old<br />\nPennslyvanian house, (FBI<br />\nmorale was sky high, as<br />\nexchanges of fingerprints for<br />\nhard cash bonuses were being<br />\nrehearsed in each agent's mind)<br />\nPatty Hearst was quite safe and<br />\nsnug, living in a seedy rowhouse<br />\nin North Baltimore.<br />\nAccording to local underground<br />\nfigures, Patty's escape from<br />\nPennsylvania to Baltimore was a<br />\nlesson in masterful timing,<br />\nunfolding like the best of Baby<br />\nFace Nelson's bank heists. As the<br />\nbloodhounds were sniffing out<br />\nher old hideaway, Patty was<br />\nWhisked away to the Philadelphia<br />\ntrain station to meet an SLA<br />\nchartered limo, scheduled to<br />\narrive in Baltimore ninety<br />\nminutes later.<br />\nMembers of the radical circle<br />\nhere were overjoyed at the<br />\nProspect of harboring the<br />\nnation's most wanted woman.<br />\nSaid one radical to another,\"I've<br />\ngot the scene down, man, listen<br />\n1-113\u2022 Patty gets here tonight. We<br />\nmeet the limo on South Charles<br />\nSt., direct them to your house<br />\nWhich is streaming with Welcome<br />\nPatty banners, hiding the dozens<br />\nof guests. Now I'll get the<br />\nwhiskey and beer, you take care<br />\nof the chips and dip, skip the<br />\n<br />\nPatty's Modest Living Quarters<br />\npretzels and I'll tell the girls to<br />\nwhip up something real nice.\" To<br />\nwhich his friend replied,\"Sounds<br />\ngood, man, but her name is<br />\nTania, not Patty, Tania.\"<br />\nAnd so, Miss Hearst entered<br />\nthe Baltimore underground,<br />\ndraped with souvenirs and<br />\ndisguises, empty bullet shells and<br />\ncounterfeit dollars, all given to<br />\nher by an adoring subversive<br />\nmob. Although her modest<br />\naparment was somewhat less<br />\nluxurious than her house in<br />\nPennsylvania, to say nothing of<br />\n<br />\nthe Hearst mansion in California,<br />\nPatty felt at ease, spending long<br />\nafternoons at the Baltimore zoo,<br />\nalternately feeding cobras and<br />\nlittle white ducks. Nights were<br />\nfilled with underground meetings<br />\nat MotherLode's Wild Cherry Pit,<br />\nwhich was suspiciously closed to<br />\nthe public throughout the Spring.<br />\nAfter a few weeks of<br />\nBaltimore living, Patty shed her<br />\nnecessarily reclusive lifestyle and<br />\nsurged into the community,<br />\nattending neighborhood<br />\nfestivities and parties. The funny<br />\n<br />\nthing is that no one suspected her<br />\ndark past, giving rise to the<br />\nheroine's new boldness and<br />\ncandor. She would calmly knock<br />\non a nearby door and introduce<br />\nherself.saying,\"Hello, I've just<br />\nmoved to this area and am<br />\nanxious to meet all my new<br />\nneighbors. I'm Patty Hearst, who<br />\nare you?\" And the neighbor<br />\nwould invariably reply,\"Oh, how<br />\nare you dear? Patty, such a<br />\npretty name to go with such a<br />\npretty girl. Come in and take<br />\nsome tea and homemade pie.\"<br />\nOne of Miss Hearst's former<br />\nneighbors, Mrs. Oscar Wertz, was<br />\nastonished when it was revealed<br />\nthat Patty had been living in<br />\nBaltimore last spring. \"I just had<br />\nno idea that it was her, she was<br />\nso sweet and ever so gentle. And<br />\nlet me tell you, buster, I don't<br />\ncare what she did on that West<br />\ncoast, she'll always be the<br />\nsimple, pale but beautiful girl<br />\nwho enriched our lives for such a<br />\nshort time.\"<br />\nMembers of the Hopkins<br />\nCommunity can feel especially<br />\nsilly for not noticing Patty's<br />\npresence last April, for both she<br />\nand her comrades were a part of<br />\nthe Hopkins Spring Fair. Situated<br />\non the side of Rowland Hall,<br />\nPatty and the gang manned a<br />\nhandicraft booth, selling<br />\nhandkerchieves and scarves, baby<br />\nbooties and fishnets, all<br />\nmonogrammed with the<br />\nmysterious letters SLA. And<br />\ncatch this: while rowdy fairgoers<br />\nwere ready to lynch the<br />\nimpersonator of George Carlin,<br />\n<br />\nPatty Hearst was roaming all over<br />\nthe goddamn campus,<br />\nundetected!<br />\nWell, even in Baltimore a<br />\nfugitive's hour glass is bound to<br />\nrun dry. When the warm weather<br />\nrolled into the City, Patty and<br />\nfriends were nowhere to be<br />\nfound. Since they left no<br />\nforwarding address, the<br />\nBaltimore underground, like the<br />\nrest of us, were left in the dark,<br />\nhoping that the FBI would never<br />\ncatch up with them. Sadly, that<br />\nhope was snuffed out in San<br />\nFrancisco, leaving eighteen<br />\nmonths of high adventure<br />\nunexplained.<br />\nBut then, that's the stuff dead<br />\nlegends are made of.<br />\n<br />\nThe Guest Room<br />\n<br />\nBut why do I laugh so much?<br />\n<br />\nBrooks films self-destructive anti-comedies<br />\nBy MIKE DEAK<br />\n\"Order!

If we<br />\ntake the rather simplistic view<br />\nthat whatever is funny is \"good\",<br />\nthen mediocre films like \"Return<br />\nof the Pink Panther\", \"Arsenic<br />\nand Old Lace\", and Bonzo Goes<br />\nto College\" must be ranked with<br />\nsuch classics as \"Duck Soup\",<br />\n\"Love and Death\", and \"The<br />\nHorn Blows at Midnight\" (Jack<br />\nBenny's neglected underground<br />\nmasterpiece.

It's his only film that<br />\nanything<br />\ndangerously<br />\nhas<br />\napproaching a theme, and the<br />\nperformances, particularly those<br />\nof Zero Mostel and GeneWilder,<br />\nare generally superior.

Imagine this:<br />\n\"And what ever happened to<br />\nPatricia Hearst, kidnapped heiress<br />\nwho denounced family and<br />\nfortune to join the Symbionese<br />\nLiberation Army back in 1974?<br />\nToday, ten years later, after<br />\nseveral unhappy marriages, Miss<br />\nHearst is living on the French<br />\nRiviera, sunning by day, dancing<br />\nby night. Asked about her<br />\ninvolvement with the SLA, Miss<br />\nHearst laughed heartily and said,<br />\n\"Oh that?

Anyway, it was an<br />\ninteresting way to live although<br />\nI wouldn't want to do it four<br />\nseasons a year.

But take<br />\nheart friends, now that Patty is in<br />\nthe grips of the law there is one<br />\nfinal story to tell. Last spring,<br />\nwhen the feds were scooping up<br />\nfingerprints in an old<br />\nPennslyvanian house, (FBI<br />\nmorale was sky high, as<br />\nexchanges of fingerprints for<br />\nhard cash bonuses were being<br />\nrehearsed in each agent's mind)<br />\nPatty Hearst was quite safe and<br />\nsnug, living in a seedy rowhouse<br />\nin North Baltimore.<br />\nAccording to local underground<br />\nfigures, Patty's escape from<br />\nPennsylvania to Baltimore was a<br />\nlesson in masterful timing,<br />\nunfolding like the best of Baby<br />\nFace Nelson's bank heists. As the<br />\nbloodhounds were sniffing out<br />\nher old hideaway, Patty was<br />\nWhisked away to the Philadelphia<br />\ntrain station to meet an SLA<br />\nchartered limo, scheduled to<br />\narrive in Baltimore ninety<br />\nminutes later.<br />\nMembers of the radical circle<br />\nhere were overjoyed at the<br />\nProspect of harboring the<br />\nnation's most wanted woman.<br />\nSaid one radical to another,\"I've<br />\ngot the scene down, man, listen<br />\n1-113\u2022 Patty gets here tonight. We<br />\nmeet the limo on South Charles<br />\nSt., direct them to your house<br />\nWhich is streaming with Welcome<br />\nPatty banners, hiding the dozens<br />\nof guests. Now I'll get the<br />\nwhiskey and beer, you take care<br />\nof the chips and dip, skip the<br /><br />\nPatty's Modest Living Quarters<br />\npretzels and I'll tell the girls to<br />\nwhip up something real nice.\" To<br />\nwhich his friend replied,\"Sounds<br />\ngood, man, but her name is<br />\nTania, not Patty, Tania.\"<br />\nAnd so, Miss Hearst entered<br />\nthe Baltimore underground,<br />\ndraped with souvenirs and<br />\ndisguises, empty bullet shells and<br />\ncounterfeit dollars, all given to<br />\nher by an adoring subversive<br />\nmob. Although her modest<br />\naparment was somewhat less<br />\nluxurious than her house in<br />\nPennsylvania, to say nothing of<br /><br />\nthe Hearst mansion in California,<br />\nPatty felt at ease, spending long<br />\nafternoons at the Baltimore zoo,<br />\nalternately feeding cobras and<br />\nlittle white ducks. Nights were<br />\nfilled with underground meetings<br />\nat MotherLode's Wild Cherry Pit,<br />\nwhich was suspiciously closed to<br />\nthe public throughout the Spring.<br />\nAfter a few weeks of<br />\nBaltimore living, Patty shed her<br />\nnecessarily reclusive lifestyle and<br />\nsurged into the community,<br />\nattending neighborhood<br />\nfestivities and parties. The funny<br /><br />\nthing is that no one suspected her<br />\ndark past, giving rise to the<br />\nheroine's new boldness and<br />\ncandor. She would calmly knock<br />\non a nearby door and introduce<br />\nherself.saying,\"Hello, I've just<br />\nmoved to this area and am<br />\nanxious to meet all my new<br />\nneighbors. I'm Patty Hearst, who<br />\nare you?\" And the neighbor<br />\nwould invariably reply,\"Oh, how<br />\nare you dear? Patty, such a<br />\npretty name to go with such a<br />\npretty girl. Come in and take<br />\nsome tea and homemade pie.\"<br />\nOne of Miss Hearst's former<br />\nneighbors, Mrs. Oscar Wertz, was<br />\nastonished when it was revealed<br />\nthat Patty had been living in<br />\nBaltimore last spring. \"I just had<br />\nno idea that it was her, she was<br />\nso sweet and ever so gentle. And<br />\nlet me tell you, buster, I don't<br />\ncare what she did on that West<br />\ncoast, she'll always be the<br />\nsimple, pale but beautiful girl<br />\nwho enriched our lives for such a<br />\nshort time.\"<br />\nMembers of the Hopkins<br />\nCommunity can feel especially<br />\nsilly for not noticing Patty's<br />\npresence last April, for both she<br />\nand her comrades were a part of<br />\nthe Hopkins Spring Fair. Situated<br />\non the side of Rowland Hall,<br />\nPatty and the gang manned a<br />\nhandicraft booth, selling<br />\nhandkerchieves and scarves, baby<br />\nbooties and fishnets, all<br />\nmonogrammed with the<br />\nmysterious letters SLA.

When the warm weather<br />\nrolled into the City, Patty and<br />\nfriends were nowhere to be<br />\nfound. Since they left no<br />\nforwarding address, the<br />\nBaltimore underground, like the<br />\nrest of us, were left in the dark,<br />\nhoping that the FBI would never<br />\ncatch up with them.

If we<br />\ntake the rather simplistic view<br />\nthat whatever is funny is \"good\",<br />\nthen mediocre films like \"Return<br />\nof the Pink Panther\", \"Arsenic<br />\nand Old Lace\", and Bonzo Goes<br />\nto College\" must be ranked with<br />\nsuch classics as \"Duck Soup\",<br />\n\"Love and Death\", and \"The<br />\nHorn Blows at Midnight\" (Jack<br />\nBenny's neglected underground<br />\nmasterpiece. In judging comedy,<br />\none must not only consider the<br />\nquantity of laughs but, more<br />\nimportantly, the quality of the<br />\nlaughs.

These two<br />\nfilms, \"The Producers\" and \"The<br />\nTwelve Chairs\" are certainly<br />\nmore entertaining (though not<br />\nnecessarily better) than either<br />\nWarhol's \"Heat\" or Bergman's<br />\n\"Scenes From a Marriage,\" which<br />\nare also playing this weekend.<br />\nWhile the Mel Brooks films will<br />\nput you in a partying mood, the<br />\nBergman flick should depress the<br />\nhell out of you and force you to<br />\nmake reservations at the nearest<br />\nmonastery and/or convent. As<br />\nfor the Andy Warhol thing, God<br />\nonly knows...<br />\nIn some respects, \"The<br />\nProducers\" is Mel Brooks's finest<br />\nfilm (he won an Academy Award<br />\nfor the script; take that for what<br />\nit's worth). It's his only film that<br />\nanything<br />\ndangerously<br />\nhas<br />\napproaching a theme, and the<br />\nperformances, particularly those<br />\nof Zero Mostel and GeneWilder,<br />\nare generally superior.

Last weekend, the<br />\nPennsylvanians<br />\nopened<br />\nby<br />\ncompletely demolishing Western<br />\nMaryland 41-0. Based on the<br />\nconference games held last<br />\nweekend the Mules are leading<br />\nthe Southern Division of the<br />\nMAC in both total offense, with<br />\n623 years and in total defense by<br />\nholding the Green Terrors to 283<br />\nyards.<br />\nMuhlenberg<br />\nquarterback,<br />\nfour-year starter Mike Reid has<br />\nalways been one of the top<br />\nsignal-callers in the MAC.
