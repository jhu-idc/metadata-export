There are a number of<br />\nshows being presented this month, most of them directed by professional organizers and producers, creating this work as a means of<br />\nexistence. These, however, may be considered natural forms of<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nThe other form, which put in its appearance recently, when a<br />\nnewly-formed organization presented several one-act plays at the<br />\nBarn, should never have occurred.<br />\nBoth the Hopkins Dramatic Club and the Homewood Playshop<br />\nshould have opportunity for displaying their talents. It should be<br />\nremembered, however, that the Dramatic Club is much the older organization and is the only recognized Hopkins dramatic activity.<br />\nThe Playshop is composed of graduate students, faculty members,<br />\nand others distantly associated with the University. These people<br />\nare also entitled to their opportunities before the footlights, but we<br />\nhope that in the future they may present their offering at a time more<br />\nconvenient to the undergraduate body.<br />\nAt present, our entire attention should be directed towards our<br />\nproduction, the only purely amateur, college presentation of the<br />\nyear.<br />\n<br />\nTHE PUBLICITY BOARD AND ITS PURPOSE<br />\nThere seems to be some confusion in the minds of certain members of both the student body and the faculty as to the exact purpose<br />\nof the Publicity Board.<br />\nThe following letter was received by the Editor-in-chief of the<br />\nBoard:<br />\n\"Why should the Publicity Board desire to attract a large number of students to Hopkins when the University is limited to an<br />\nenrollment of less than 700 undergraduates?<br />\n\"Further, why should the University be advertised solely through<br />\nits athletic achievements? This last question was put to me by a<br />\nmember of the faculty. . . .\"<br />\nIt is perfectly obvious that the writer of this letter has not followed the occasional explanations that have appeared in the NewsLetter.<br />\nThe Athletic Board and the Student Council, in sponsoring the<br />\nPublicity Board work, realized that a flood of applications for entrance to the University would enable the authorities to make a<br />\ncareful selection, using the past records of the applicants as evidence<br />\nof their ability. In addition to this the enrollment of a number of outof-town students will help to make the dormitories the center of<br />\nstudent life.<br />\nAs to the second question, concerning the release of athletic<br />\ninformation as the sole means of advertising the University, there<br />\nseems to be further evidence of confusion.<br />\nAs revealed by the records of the Board, the release of information has been divided equally between athletic and non-athletic activities.<br />\nThe aim of the organization is, not to improve the University by<br />\nquantity, but by quality.<br />\nWith the aid of the Publicity Board, and the State Legislature,<br />\nin repealing the law compelling the state universities to accept graduates of state high schools, Hopkins will eventually become an exclusive institution.<br />\n<br />\nHere's why<br />\n<br />\nCAMELS are<br />\n<br />\nthe quality cigarette<br />\nECAUSE we put the utmost quality into<br />\nthis one brand. Camels are as good as it's<br />\npossible for skill, money and lifelong knowledge<br />\nof fine tobaccos to make a cigarette.<br />\n<br />\nB<br />\n<br />\nNothing is too good for Camels. And bear<br />\nthis in mind! Everything is done to make<br />\nCamels the best cigarette it's possible to buy.<br />\nNothing is done simply for show.<br />\nTake the Camel package for instance. It's the<br />\nmost perfect packing science can devise to protect cigarettes and keep them fresh. Heavy<br />\npaper\u2014secure foil wrapping\u2014revenue stamp<br />\nto seal the fold and make the package air-tight.<br />\nBut there's nothing flashy about it. You'll find<br />\nno extra wrappers. No frills or furbelows.<br />\nSuch things do not improve the smoke any<br />\nmore than premiums or coupons. And remember<br />\n\u2014you must pay their extra cost or get lowered<br />\nquality.<br />\nIf you want the smoothest, mellowest, mildest<br />\ncigarette you can imagine\u2014and one entirely free<br />\nfrom cigaretty aftertaste,<br />\nIt's Camels for you.<br />\n<br />\nR.

Only two houses<br />\nwere found tO\"have'been used, the<br />\nlarger probably by a bluebird and<br />\nthe other by a wren. In the wren<br />\nbox was found evidence of a tragedy of the woods. A whole egg remained in the bottom of the nest,<br />\nwhile on the interior walls of the<br />\nbox a colony of mud-dauber wasps<br />\nhad plastered their spider-filled<br />\ncells. It was conjectured that the<br />\ninsects had stung, or at least worried, the setting birds from their<br />\neggs. Dr. Cowles believed that<br />\nmost of the boxes were too high to<br />\nplease the nest makers, and in consequence the highest were moved to<br />\nabout fifteen feet from the ground.<br />\nThe nest boxes had already been<br />\nnumbered, but the numbers were<br />\nnow marked upon the blue prints,<br />\nand all data concerning them re<br />\ncorded. They will thus serve a twofold purpose, give shelter to the<br />\nbirds and to the Naturalists know!.<br />\nedge of the birds' habits. There are<br />\nabout thirty bird boxes on. the<br />\ncampus, and of these seventeen were<br />\nput into condition last Saturday.<br />\nThe others will be attended to in<br />\nthe near futlire.<br />\n<br />\nFULL DRESS<br />\n<br />\nSPORT WEAR<br />\n<br />\nClothes if Custom<br />\n14<br />\n<br />\nN._CharlesS<br />\n<br />\nEnglish Clothes Tailored in America<br />\n<br />\n530 to P-5<br />\n<br />\nORTMAN'S<br />\n<br />\nMt.

There are a number of<br />\nshows being presented this month, most of them directed by professional organizers and producers, creating this work as a means of<br />\nexistence. These, however, may be considered natural forms of<br />\ncompetition.<br />\nThe other form, which put in its appearance recently, when a<br />\nnewly-formed organization presented several one-act plays at the<br />\nBarn, should never have occurred.<br />\nBoth the Hopkins Dramatic Club and the Homewood Playshop<br />\nshould have opportunity for displaying their talents. It should be<br />\nremembered, however, that the Dramatic Club is much the older organization and is the only recognized Hopkins dramatic activity.<br />\nThe Playshop is composed of graduate students, faculty members,<br />\nand others distantly associated with the University. These people<br />\nare also entitled to their opportunities before the footlights, but we<br />\nhope that in the future they may present their offering at a time more<br />\nconvenient to the undergraduate body.<br />\nAt present, our entire attention should be directed towards our<br />\nproduction, the only purely amateur, college presentation of the<br />\nyear.<br /><br />\nTHE PUBLICITY BOARD AND ITS PURPOSE<br />\nThere seems to be some confusion in the minds of certain members of both the student body and the faculty as to the exact purpose<br />\nof the Publicity Board.<br />\nThe following letter was received by the Editor-in-chief of the<br />\nBoard:<br />\n\"Why should the Publicity Board desire to attract a large number of students to Hopkins when the University is limited to an<br />\nenrollment of less than 700 undergraduates?<br />\n\"Further, why should the University be advertised solely through<br />\nits athletic achievements? This last question was put to me by a<br />\nmember of the faculty. . . .\"<br />\nIt is perfectly obvious that the writer of this letter has not followed the occasional explanations that have appeared in the NewsLetter.<br />\nThe Athletic Board and the Student Council, in sponsoring the<br />\nPublicity Board work, realized that a flood of applications for entrance to the University would enable the authorities to make a<br />\ncareful selection, using the past records of the applicants as evidence<br />\nof their ability. In addition to this the enrollment of a number of outof-town students will help to make the dormitories the center of<br />\nstudent life.<br />\nAs to the second question, concerning the release of athletic<br />\ninformation as the sole means of advertising the University, there<br />\nseems to be further evidence of confusion.<br />\nAs revealed by the records of the Board, the release of information has been divided equally between athletic and non-athletic activities.<br />\nThe aim of the organization is, not to improve the University by<br />\nquantity, but by quality.<br />\nWith the aid of the Publicity Board, and the State Legislature,<br />\nin repealing the law compelling the state universities to accept graduates of state high schools, Hopkins will eventually become an exclusive institution.<br /><br />\nHere's why<br /><br />\nCAMELS are<br /><br />\nthe quality cigarette<br />\nECAUSE we put the utmost quality into<br />\nthis one brand. Camels are as good as it's<br />\npossible for skill, money and lifelong knowledge<br />\nof fine tobaccos to make a cigarette.<br /><br />\nB<br /><br />\nNothing is too good for Camels. And bear<br />\nthis in mind! Everything is done to make<br />\nCamels the best cigarette it's possible to buy.<br />\nNothing is done simply for show.<br />\nTake the Camel package for instance. It's the<br />\nmost perfect packing science can devise to protect cigarettes and keep them fresh. Heavy<br />\npaper\u2014secure foil wrapping\u2014revenue stamp<br />\nto seal the fold and make the package air-tight.<br />\nBut there's nothing flashy about it. You'll find<br />\nno extra wrappers. No frills or furbelows.<br />\nSuch things do not improve the smoke any<br />\nmore than premiums or coupons. And remember<br />\n\u2014you must pay their extra cost or get lowered<br />\nquality.<br />\nIf you want the smoothest, mellowest, mildest<br />\ncigarette you can imagine\u2014and one entirely free<br />\nfrom cigaretty aftertaste,<br />\nIt's Camels for you.<br /><br />\nR.

Only two houses<br />\nwere found tO\"have'been used, the<br />\nlarger probably by a bluebird and<br />\nthe other by a wren. In the wren<br />\nbox was found evidence of a tragedy of the woods. A whole egg remained in the bottom of the nest,<br />\nwhile on the interior walls of the<br />\nbox a colony of mud-dauber wasps<br />\nhad plastered their spider-filled<br />\ncells. It was conjectured that the<br />\ninsects had stung, or at least worried, the setting birds from their<br />\neggs. Dr. Cowles believed that<br />\nmost of the boxes were too high to<br />\nplease the nest makers, and in consequence the highest were moved to<br />\nabout fifteen feet from the ground.<br />\nThe nest boxes had already been<br />\nnumbered, but the numbers were<br />\nnow marked upon the blue prints,<br />\nand all data concerning them re<br />\ncorded. They will thus serve a twofold purpose, give shelter to the<br />\nbirds and to the Naturalists know!.<br />\nedge of the birds' habits.
