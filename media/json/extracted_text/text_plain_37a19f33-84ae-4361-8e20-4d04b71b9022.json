We<br />\nwould want to do [renovations<br />\non] one building within fifteen<br />\nmonths so it would be reopened '<br />\nthe following September.\"<br />\nIdeally, said Welch, the<br />\nUniversity would then begin<br />\nrenovations on the second<br />\nbuildings one year after the start<br />\nof renovations on the first.<br />\nWelch acknowledged that the<br />\nUniversity would be displacing<br />\nroughly 200 students during each<br />\nyear of renovations. \"What we<br />\nwould do is to approach a number<br />\nof landlords in large buildings in<br />\nthe hopes of providing twenty or<br />\n<br />\nthirty beds,\" he said. \"We would<br />\nspread students out into six to ten<br />\nbuildings.\"<br />\nHe doubted that the resulting<br />\nincrease in demand for nearby.<br />\nhousing would drive up rents in<br />\nnearby apartments and row<br />\nhouses because the renovating<br />\nprocess would be short-term.<br />\nThere have been discussions<br />\nabout adding more on-campus<br />\ndormitory space, according to<br />\nWelch. Welch said, though, that<br />\nrenovating McCoy and Wolman<br />\nHalls was a more pressing need<br />\nfor the University.<br />\nHe added that students will<br />\nhave some input in the renovation<br />\n<br />\nprocess once the University has<br />\n\"concrete architectural plans,\"<br />\nsaying, \"We'll have to consider<br />\nwhat we'll want to put in the way<br />\nof amenities, and there students<br />\nwill have some input.\"<br />\nAs an example of this input, according to Welch, over fifty percent \u2022 of returning students<br />\nresponded to a University survey<br />\non housing in the summer of<br />\n1986.

Lee Davis<br />\n<br />\nFacing Change<br />\nThe opportunity for change presents<br />\nitself in all kinds of ways. This summer,<br />\ntwo men took the helm of the School of<br />\nArts and Sciences. The School's newly<br />\nappointed dean, Dr. Lloyd Armstrong,<br />\nbrings expertise from his former position as chairman of the Department of<br />\nPhysics and Astronomy; the new<br />\nassociate dean, Dr. P. Kyle McCarter,<br />\nprofessor in the Near Eastern Studies<br />\nDepartment, complements Armstrong<br />\nwith his humanities background.<br />\nArmstrong and McCarter, in taking<br />\nthese positions, assume responsibility<br />\nfor the academic climate at Homewood.<br />\nTheir experience, as well as the experience of their predecessors, can and<br />\nshould be implemented as they try to<br />\nascertain the status of education in the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences. However,<br />\nArmstrong and McCarter's experience<br />\ncomes from two faculty members'<br />\nperspectives. As they assume their new<br />\npositions, they will need to understand<br />\nthe concerns of all members of the<br />\nHopkins community.. Armstrong and<br />\nMcCarter might most effectively fill<br />\ntheir roles if they take what they have<br />\ngained here, organize it and hold it as<br />\nif under one arm, and keep the other<br />\nhand free to shake and greet new ideas<br />\nand challenges within the community.<br />\n<br />\nThis fall Hopkins will see yet another<br />\nnew face\u2014 the Mind-Brain Institute.<br />\nWhile this new program might seemingly be of little concern for Homewood<br />\nundergraduates, it could in the future be<br />\ninstrumental in helping alter the purposes and goals of the University.<br />\nEstablished as an attempt to bring<br />\ntogether the fields of neuroscience with<br />\nthe cognitive sciences, the Institute will<br />\nhouse the laboratories and offices of top<br />\nresearchers in fields such as<br />\nneurobiology and psychology. They<br />\nwill work together, investigating areas<br />\nsuch as memory, perception, movement<br />\ncontrol, and language.<br />\nWith the ever-increasing accumulation of all kinds of knowledge, scien-<br />\n<br />\ntists become more and more deeply entrenched in specialties of their field. It<br />\nis easy to lose sight of the ultimate purpose of scientific study: a continual attempt to improve, in all ways, the quality of life. The inter-departmental focus<br />\nof the Mind-Brain Institute will force<br />\nresearchers to step back from their own<br />\nprojects and study the ways in which information gathered from other fields can<br />\naid their own work.<br />\nPerhaps the Institute can lend itself\u2014<br />\nat least in principle\u2014 to the curricula for<br />\nthe Schools of Arts and Sciences and<br />\nEngineering. The inter-departmental approach obviously contributes greatly to<br />\nthe understanding of a given topic. It<br />\nalso serves as a vehicle by which a more<br />\nwell-rounded education is achieved.<br />\nThis approach would certainly<br />\nnecessitate a change in attitudes towards<br />\nacademics here, since many Hopkins<br />\nstudents tend to follow a preprofessional course of studies; such curricula are intense and very competitive<br />\nand leave little time for appreciation of<br />\nother fields. The implementation of this<br />\ntype of change is made more complex<br />\nby the Hopkins legacy of graduate<br />\nstudy. Historically, Hopkins was established as a research university in the<br />\nlikeness of the great European schools.<br />\nTaking into consideration our history,<br />\nthe shift towards a varied curriculum is<br />\nthat much more fundamental. Homewood Administrators, new and old,<br />\nshould consider the benefits of such<br />\nchanges without being reticent because<br />\nof its deviance from current attitudes.<br />\nOn the contrary, they should feel comfortable that the two approaches are<br />\ncompatible. For example, the University's strengths in independent study<br />\nprograms can lend itself just as easily<br />\nto inter-departmental research.<br />\nBoth the appointments in the School<br />\nof Arts and Sciences and the establishment of the Mind-Brain Institute present<br />\nthe potential for change, directly and indirectly, for the undergraduates at<br />\nHomewood. This potential should be<br />\nrealized.<br />\n<br />\nHome is where the heart is,<br />\ngenerally speaking of course.<br />\nMore likely home is where your<br />\nCD player is, where that cute set<br />\nof buns are, or in worst-case<br />\nscenarios, wherever you happen<br />\nto fall down. The old cliche<br />\n(which brings to mind Grandma<br />\nknitting by a fireplace, and other<br />\nemetic scenes of domesticated<br />\nlife) nevertheless contains a bit of<br />\ntruth. Everyone has a place, a<br />\nroom, a location that feels right<br />\nin some way, and it is only when<br />\nthis place is left that its importance is realized. Writers are told<br />\nthat if they would like to write<br />\nabout a place, the best thing to do<br />\nis to leave it.<br />\nLike many of my fellow<br />\nstudents, I find the academic year<br />\ninordinately long and tiresome. It<br />\nseems, in March, that May will<br />\nnever come. The middle of the<br />\nmonth will never arrive and<br />\nrelease me from Hopkins, allow<br />\nme to get into my car and make<br />\nthe 400 mile drive back up 95 to<br />\nRhode Island. Back to the ocean,<br />\nto dinner at Courtney's, and long<br />\nnights walking the crowded<br />\nstreets of Newport. Back to hull<br />\nspeed on the bay and lobster from<br />\nthe shell. Back to see friends from<br />\nthe neighborhood, from high<br />\nschool, people I've known for<br />\nyears.<br />\nAs the class of 1987 was being<br />\ncommenced, I arrived home and<br />\nbegan work for a computer company. Days and weeks passed in<br />\nquick, 8-hour segments. One day<br />\nin July, I found myself bogged in<br />\nthe usual beach traffic. Something<br />\nwas different however, and it<br />\nwasn't the fact that the plate<br />\nahead of me was from New York,<br />\nnot Jersey. As I inched forward,<br />\nmy clutch knee aching, scenes<br />\nfrom Spring Fair shot through my<br />\nmind. Could it be true? After a<br />\nmere two months could I actual-<br />\n<br />\nly be missing the place I had so<br />\nrecently called Hell?<br />\nI found the answer that afternoon. A young blonde kid, a high<br />\nschool junior, approached me as<br />\nI browsed through the local bike<br />\nshop.<br />\n\"A beauty,\" he said as I<br />\npolished a chromed handlebar<br />\nwith the tail of my shirt.<br />\n\"Sure is. She'd be great on the<br />\nhills.\"\u2022<br />\n\"Around here? What hills?<br />\nWhere are you from?\"<br />\n\"Baltimore. I'm here working<br />\nfor the summer.\"<br />\nI later found out that he had a<br />\nfriend from Connecticut who was<br />\nentering Hopkins to play<br />\nlacrosse. After the expected promise to \"look him up\" I left the<br />\nshop. The kid suggested that I<br />\nride my bike back to Baltimore,<br />\nsince the North to South trip<br />\n\"would be all downhill.\"<br />\nI was shocked a bit by his<br />\nbizarre reconciliation of Newton<br />\nto geography (then again, he hung<br />\nout with lacrosse players) but<br />\ndrove home even more surprised<br />\nat my own statements. I did not<br />\nsay that I was from Rhode Island<br />\nand went to school in Baltimore.<br />\nI said that I was from Baltimore<br />\nand worked in Rhode Island. A<br />\nsmall but significant difference.<br />\nBy the middle of August, the<br />\nsummer seemed interminable.<br />\nSeptember was a carrot on a<br />\nstick. I wanted to leave the Biggest Little State in the Union, get<br />\ninto my car and make the 400<br />\nmile trip \"down\" 95 to<br />\nBaltimore. Back to the Harbor, to<br />\nLexington Market. To dinner at<br />\nHausner's and foreign flicks at<br />\nthe Charles. To caffeine-induced<br />\nalertness and blurry nights at the<br />\nHut. To the smell of Sig Ep<br />\nchicken and the taste of steamed<br />\nblueclaw.

I figured, hey, what the<br />\nheck, ARA is out, Seiler's is in,<br />\nand they can't be that bad. So I<br />\nwent for the bold stroke and<br />\ndecided to go back to the Terrace<br />\nRoom for this, my final semester,<br />\nbut sadly have found the food<br />\npretty much the same as when I<br />\nleft it.<br />\nThis brings me to the point I've<br />\nbeen leading up to. Here I am,<br />\nback on the meal plan, and I<br />\nrealize that those at Seiler's have<br />\nmuch to learn about passive<br />\nlighting. As they must surely<br />\nnote, stores such as clothing and<br />\nwindow-shade stores are always<br />\nwell-lit, so the customer can easily see exactly what he or she is<br />\nbuying. On the other hand,<br />\nrestaurants, especially ones with<br />\nunpronouncable names, are<br />\nalmost universally dimly lit, for<br />\nit is difficult to spot that elusive<br />\nhair in your Lo Mein if you're<br />\nunable to see. Therefore it is clear<br />\nthat the Terrace Room is far too<br />\nwell lit, for nobody eating there<br />\nreally wants to see what they are<br />\neating. So may I therefore suggest<br />\nthat Seiler's dim the rheostat, and<br />\nperhaps maybe even nature will<br />\ntake its usual course in a newatmosphere<br />\nof<br />\nfound<br />\n<br />\nby Bruce A.

Darkness is bad for you; it<br />\nis dangerous to your health. So<br />\none would think that a key part<br />\nof a university education should<br />\nbe the promotion of a bunch of<br />\ndecent 100 watt bulbs so you can<br />\nlive a healthy, happy existence.<br />\nUnfortunately, as in many other<br />\nthings, The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity does things, well, kind<br />\nof not the way they should be<br />\ndone. There are a number of<br />\nplaces on the campus where light<br />\nis not as well promoted as it<br />\nshould be; alas these are the Best<br />\nPlaces to Go Blind From Eye<br />\nStrain. The candidates for this<br />\ncoveted award are numerous.<br />\nBut first there are in contrast a<br />\nnumber of places where there<br />\nshould be less light, but instead<br />\nis too much.

The place is England in<br />\nthe 1890's, and Lane is one of<br />\nWilde's many stereotypes slow<br />\nbut definite to a point in which he<br />\nbecomes comical. To add to the<br />\nmelodramatic effect, Algernon<br />\nMoncrieff (Loren Fox), the<br />\nowner of the house, accompanies<br />\nLane with his not-all-that-perfect<br />\nof Tit-Willow.<br />\nrendition<br />\nAlthough nothing funny is said,<br />\nand nothing silly is done, the<br />\nopening is humorous, drawing a<br />\nfew hearty chuckles from the audience.

The seriousness of<br />\ntheir actions heightened the contrast with the play's absurdity, not<br />\ncausing immediate laughter, but<br />\nhidden laughter, after a moment's<br />\nthought: Wilde's sly humor is not<br />\nmeant for the slow witted.

Below are nine films many<br />\nstudents will consider seeing in<br />\ntheir brief respites from studying.<br />\nChoose carefully. For movie<br />\ntimes, call the theatres: Movies at<br />\nHarborpark, 837-3500; The<br />\nRotunda, 235-1800; Towson Art<br />\nCinema, 823-2436.<br />\nThe Big Easy is a romantic<br />\npolice story. Dennis Quaid is one<br />\nof the best New Orleans cops,<br />\nbelieving that he is one of the last<br />\ngood guys\u2014fighting the Mafia<br />\n(\"Wise guys\" in this town).<br />\nEllen Barkin, a district attorney's<br />\ninvestigator, thinks that the petty<br />\ncorruption of the police force has<br />\ngone too far. They puzzle over a<br />\ngang war, they fall in love.<br />\nQuaid, with his thick-tongued<br />\nrendition of an New Orleans accent, is far too cutesy for his own<br />\ngood, but he and Barkin have one<br />\nof the best romance scenes of recent movies. The Big Easy,<br />\nhowever, is too easy about relations between races, sexes, and<br />\npower and responsibility. This is<br />\na decent movie; it is also one that<br />\nwill lull the audience into accepting the contrived for the real.<br />\nRotunda. B-.<br />\nThe Fourth Protocol is an espionage thriller based on<br />\nFrederick Forsyth's book of that<br />\ntitle. It stars Michael Caine as a<br />\nBritish counter-intelligence agent<br />\nwith more humor than reserve,<br />\nand Pierce \"almost-James-Bond\"<br />\nBrosnan as a top Soviet agent<br />\nassigned to build and detonate an<br />\natomic bomb by a U.S. airbase.<br />\n<br />\nForsyth's plot has been streamlined, but because the movie uses<br />\nthe same fast pacing and short<br />\nepisodes, it may be difficult to<br />\nfollow. Caine shows that his omnipresence is not all bad; his<br />\ncharacter and those of the other<br />\nBritish agents are all fine.<br />\nBrosnan is adequate (his role is<br />\ntoo cool and flat). The other<br />\nSoviets are laughable: a KGB<br />\ngeneral Ned Beatty is not. Less<br />\nthan thrilling. Rotunda. B-.<br />\nThe Living Daylights is the new<br />\nJames Bond movie, starring the<br />\nnewest James Bond, Timothy<br />\nDalton. Dalton brings good<br />\ndramatic acting to the role, but<br />\nfails to convey the sense of fun<br />\nthat Connery or even Moore did.<br />\nThis James Bond is tense and.<br />\ntired. The plot is silly, as usual,<br />\ncentering on covert arms deals.<br />\nFor some reason a KGB general<br />\nmust be killed, but it's all very<br />\nmuddled. There are some neat<br />\nstunts, including a cello snow<br />\nchase (say that three times fast).<br />\nBond's love interest, Maryam<br />\nD'Abo, is sexy but lacks the<br />\nglamour of, say, Fawn Hall. The<br />\numpteenth outing of007 is disappointing, although the vehicle<br />\nwore thin ten years ago. For<br />\nBond fanatics only. Harbor. B-.<br />\nLa Bamba follows the rise and<br />\ndeath of Ritchie Valens, the 17<br />\nyear old rock star killed in the<br />\nsame plane crash as Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper(remember<br />\n\"American Pie\"?). This is not a<br />\nshowbiz story; this is a story<br />\nabout a Hispanic teenager who<br />\nlives the American Dream. Lou<br />\nDiamond Philips makes a good<br />\nValens, and Los Lobos sing the<br />\nsongs with gusto. Ritchie isn't<br />\nnearly as interesting as his \"bad\"<br />\nbrother, and the occasional des-<br />\n<br />\ncent into soap opera doesn't help.<br />\nBut this is a good, honest film.<br />\nand an adult film you can take the<br />\nkids to see. Director Luis Valdez<br />\nhandles the concert scenes well.<br />\nMarshall Crenshaw makes a<br />\nwonderful cameo as Buddy Holly. Towson. B+.<br />\nNo Way Out presents Kevin<br />\nCostner in his second major role<br />\nof the summer. He is a naval hero<br />\nwho gets transferred to the Pentagon. Gene Hackman is the<br />\nSecretary of Defense and Sean<br />\nYoung his mistress. Party girl<br />\nYoung falls for upwardly mobile<br />\nCostner. Hackman ckiesn't know<br />\nwho Young is seeing, but he is<br />\nvery jealous\u2014he \"accidentally\"<br />\nkills her. The cover-up begins.<br />\nHackman and his aide (Will Patton) decide the \"other man\" will<br />\nbe blamed. The catch is, they<br />\nassign that mission to that very<br />\nman, Costner. Costner is hardly<br />\nlackluster in this desperate role,<br />\nbut he has not shown versatility<br />\nin his work this summer.<br />\nHackman and Patton give better<br />\nperformances, as weak men given<br />\npower. The ending does not ruin<br />\nthe movie: it is the camp version<br />\nof elegant, geometrical storytelling. Rotunda. B +.<br />\nRobocop will fool you. Most<br />\npeople will think it's a typical<br />\nSchwarzenegger-Stallone kill the<br />\nworld flick. It's actually intelligent, well-handled science<br />\nfiction. Robocop is part of the<br />\nmovement called \"Cyberpunk\"<br />\nwhich, like Max Headroom,<br />\nbelieves that the near future will<br />\nbe a dismal landscape of urban<br />\ndecay and bureaucratic masturbation. Director Paul Verhoeven<br />\nhas made a comic-book on the big<br />\nscreen, and filled it with several<br />\nlevels of meaning and satire.<br />\n<br />\nSean Young and Kevin Costner in No Way Out.<br />\nPeter Weller (Buckaroo Banzai,,<br />\nplays the mechanized copper<br />\nwell, although he got the role<br />\nbecause as a long-distance runner, he was the only one who<br />\ncould act under 200 lbs. of<br />\nmakeup. Give the man a hand. If<br />\na little violence doesn't scare you<br />\noff, go see this cross between<br />\nRepo Man and A Boy and Has<br />\nDog. Bring your sense of irony.<br />\nHarbor. A-.<br />\nRoxanne is Steve Martin's clever<br />\nmodernization of the Cyrano<br />\nstory. Martin is the fire chief in<br />\na small western town with a really, really big schnozz. He falls<br />\nfor visiting astronomer Daryl<br />\nHannah. What follows is one of<br />\nthe brightest, crispest movies of<br />\nthe year. Forget that it pales in<br />\ncomparison to Rostand's brilliant<br />\nplay. There is no \"Thus as I end<br />\nthe refrain\" scene; instead, Steve<br />\nMartin beats up two guys with a<br />\ntennis racket. This is Steve Martin at his best, unusually intelligent, funny, athletic and<br />\nsharp. This is a film for people<br />\nwho promise not to compare it to<br />\nthe play. Towson. A-.<br />\nStakeout is an easy movie to like.<br />\nRichard Dreyfuss and Emilio<br />\nEstevez are Seattle cops watching<br />\nthe ex-girlfriend of a recently<br />\nescaped convict; Dreyfuss falls<br />\nfor the woman (Madeleine Stowe)<br />\nand life becomes hectic for all in-<br />\n<br />\nvolved. Dreyfuss confirms his<br />\nreturn from oblivion and Estevez<br />\nshows he is an adult at last. Stowe<br />\nis sweet in her role, in a summer<br />\nbearing too few strong women's<br />\nroles. There is no excuse for the<br />\nrelish with which director John<br />\nBadham (Blue Thunder)turns out<br />\nthe typical car chase and dream<br />\nsequence. Although the movie is<br />\njuvenile, with no pretensions, it<br />\nis also enjoyable. Harbor. B.<br />\nThe Untouchables confirms<br />\nwhat we've long suspected: Brian<br />\nDe Palma is an excellent stylist<br />\nwho longs desperately to be an<br />\nauteur but unfortunately has<br />\nnothing to say. In this confrontation between Al Capone (Robert<br />\nDeNiro) and Elliot Ness (Kevin<br />\nCostner), De Palma avoids Hitchcock and steals instead from<br />\nEisenstein and Woody Allen.<br />\nCostner has been touted as<br />\nHollywood's new leading man,<br />\nbut judging from his Ness.<br />\nHollywood must be looking for a<br />\nbland mix of Mark Harmon and<br />\nTom Cruise. DeNiro plays<br />\nCapone as an opera character.<br />\nand we never get to see him alone<br />\nor personal. Actually, it's the best<br />\nlooking movie of the summer,<br />\nalthough there was no reason to<br />\nmake it. Sean Connery steals the<br />\nshow as a walking cliche. Harbor.

One vendor<br />\nspecializes in Australian goods:<br />\ncandy, clothing and stuffed<br />\nkangaroos. As on the first level<br />\nthere are a great variety of<br />\nspecialty foods, and some notables<br />\ninclude Swenson ice cream,<br />\nFudgery fudge, Pennsylvania<br />\nfried dough. Shucker's seafood,<br />\nand Thrasher's fries. The extensive selection should be enough<br />\nto satify most people's appetite<br />\nwhims.

Its major attractions are<br />\nsituated right beside the<br />\nChesapeake Bay.<br />\nThe Light Street and Pratt<br />\nStreet Pavilions make up Harborplace, a collection of 140<br />\nspecialty shops and restaurants.<br />\nFor general shopping, one can<br />\nbrowse through the Pratt Street<br />\nPavilion; it contains stores selling<br />\nclothing, shoes, fine china, and<br />\nimpressive selections of unusual<br />\ncards, stuffed animals, music<br />\nboxes and games. Several famous<br />\nrestaurants specializing in Indian<br />\n(Tandoor), Grecian (Taverna<br />\nAthena) and seafood (Mariner's<br />\nPier One) dishes are located inside the two-level building. One<br />\ncan dine while looking at the Inner Harbor Marina in the Bamboo House. This Chinese<br />\nrestaurant serves Mandarin and<br />\nSzechuan.cuisine in a \"bamboo\"<br />\ntheme setting.<br />\nWhile the Light Street Pavilion<br />\nalso offers several restaurants, its<br />\ngreatest attraction is a wide variety of food stands. On the ground<br />\nlevel, one can buy exotic<br />\ncookbooks, multi-flavored jelly<br />\nbeans, honey-laden baked goods,<br />\nand lollipops which come in ice<br />\ncream flavors like chocolate mint.<br />\nThe jelly bean store also sells the<br />\nultimate in chocolate games: a<br />\ncomplete multi-colored Monopoly board, bank money included,<br />\nwhich sells for only $500.<br />\nOn the second level of the<br />\npavilion, there are a variety of<br />\nshops and more food vendors.<br />\nFor people who adore penguins<br />\nor love the Orioles, each bird has<br />\nits own stand filled with items<br />\n<br />\nRichard Bell<br />\n<br />\nby Kim Juvan<br />\n<br />\nHarborplace, home to the U.S.S.

Clothing and shoe stores<br />\nare most prevalent, though<br />\nunusual merchandise can be<br />\nfound in several specialty shops.<br />\n\"The Sharper Image,\" for example, sells a Japanese massage<br />\nboard, hologram and titanium<br />\nwatches, as well as high-quality<br />\nlenswear (cameras, binoculars,<br />\netc.) A very new style clothing<br />\nstore, \"Units System,\" supplies<br />\nclothing based on a basic blockshape, all knits which can be fitted together to make a wardrobe.<br />\nA walk-way from the third floor<br />\nof the four-story mall connects it<br />\nto the Pratt Street Pavilion to<br />\navoid traffic-crossing problems.<br />\nFor anyone interested in more<br />\nfood and seeing a different<br />\nperspective of Baltimore, Lexington Market is a ten-minute<br />\nwalk northwest of the harbor<br />\narea. Again, there are many<br />\nspecialty food stands including<br />\nfresh produce, and the short hike<br />\ntakes you past department stores,<br />\noffice buildings and more<br />\n\"local\" entertainment areas. The<br />\nLexington Mall shops are geared<br />\nmore for neighborhood shoppers<br />\nthan tourists.<br />\nIn planning a trip to the Inner<br />\nHarbor area, it should be noted<br />\nthat both pavilions and nearby<br />\nConvention Center mall contain<br />\n\"Easy-Bank\" or \"Most\"<br />\nmachines. You can take the<br />\nnumber 3 and number 61 buses<br />\ndown St. Paul Street to within<br />\nseveral blocks of the harbor. In<br />\nfact, the 3 bus passes Lexington<br />\nMall at Saratoga and Froward<br />\nStreets.

Mount<br />\nVernon is the stretch of unique<br />\nrestaurants and odd shops near<br />\nthe Washington Monument on the<br />\n800 block of North Charles. Here<br />\nis a sampling:<br />\nTony Cheng's Szechuan<br />\n(801 N. Charles St., 539-6666):<br />\nFor the best Chinese food in<br />\nBaltimore, stop by Tony<br />\nCheng's. They serve superb<br />\nSzechuan cuisine and some Mandarin dishes. Dinner will cost<br />\nabout $20 a head for a full meal,<br />\nbut be prepared to pay even more<br />\nfor specialty dishes. Weekday<br />\nlunches are significantly cheaper.<br />\nLouie's Bookstore Cafe<br />\n(518 N. Charles St., 962-1224):<br />\nLouie's appeals to the artist in<br />\nall of us. The cafe itself is<br />\ndecorated with paintings from<br />\nlocal artists (all for sale), and live<br />\n<br />\nThe Red Sea<br />\n(around the corner from Tony<br />\nCheng's, 547-8178): The Red<br />\nSea is the only Ethiopian<br />\nrestaurant in Baltimore. Ethiopian<br />\ncuisine is similar to Indian food<br />\nin flavor, but it is not nearly as<br />\nstrong\u2014better suited to American<br />\npalates. Another novelty is that<br />\nyou eat it with your hands. If this<br />\nrepulses you, it is a shame,<br />\nbecause the food is quite good.<br />\nThe staff is very helpful for Ecuisine virgins. They can even<br />\nrecommend entrees for you if you<br />\nfind yourself lost in the<br />\ntransliterations. An entree and a<br />\nglass of Tej (honey wine) costs<br />\nbetween $15 and $20 per person<br />\nand less without the wine.<br />\nTransportation to Mount Vernon is easy by the Med School<br />\nShuttle (see schedule elsewhere in<br />\nthis article), and it's free! Just get<br />\noff at the Peabody Conservatory<br />\nstop and walk up the hill to<br />\nCharles Street. You can also take<br />\na city bus downtown. Most buses<br />\ngo down Cathedral Street.

Lunch offers cafe items<br />\nsuch as salads and sandwiches<br />\nwith a twist. Louie's is also<br />\nrumored to have the best coffee<br />\nin Baltimore. The dinner menu<br />\nprovides an interesting combination of entrees like tenthouse<br />\nchicken (chicken breasts with<br />\noyster stuffing) or pasta<br />\nprimavera (fettucine and fresh<br />\nvegetables in a cream sauce). A<br />\nfull dinner with appetizer and<br />\nsalad will cost around $20 per<br />\nperson including tip.<br />\nGampy 's<br />\n(904 N. Charles, 837-9797):<br />\nGampy's, or The Great<br />\nAmerican Melting Pot, is all its<br />\nname entails. The menu is exceptionally diverse. You can order<br />\nall types of food from hot dogs to<br />\nBeef Wellington. And the food is<br />\nconsistently excellent. Because<br />\nthe customer is not limited to buying an entree, prices vary, but<br />\nthey are not exorbitant. Gampy's<br />\ndoes not take reservations after<br />\n6:30 so be sure to call early on<br />\nweekend nights.<br />\n<br />\nThe Peabody Conservatory,<br />\nlocated in the Mount Vernon<br />\narea, is one of the few bastions<br />\nof humanities in the fields of<br />\nscience one normally associates<br />\nwith Hopkins. Artistically inclined -(and talented) students may<br />\ntake courses at Peabody. such as<br />\ninstrumental or voice lessons, or<br />\nmusic theory or recording techniques. Hopkins students may also<br />\nparticipate in Peabody ensembles<br />\n(orchestra, chorus, chamber<br />\nmusic, opera. and wind<br />\nensemble).<br />\nPeabody also has a wide variety of cultural offerings for the<br />\ncommunity, such as concerts,<br />\noperas and recitals, and an excellent music library. A Hopkins<br />\nID is all you need to check out<br />\nmusic, use the practice rooms, or<br />\nreceive discounts on events (as<br />\nlong as you purchase your aiscount ticket in advance). The<br />\nMedical School Shuttle stops here<br />\non its route, providing easy (and<br />\nfree) access to Peabody and the<br />\n,rest of Mount Vernon.<br />\n<br />\nThe Peabody Conservatory, an internationally renowned school of music, now part of the Johns Hopkins University. It's<br />\na nice place to spend a rainy Saturday (listening to pretty music).<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 10-SEPTEMBER 18, 1987<br />\n<br />\nShopping in style. . .Owings Mills<br />\nby D. Zeiger<br />\nOMM . . . No, It's not some exotic transcendental meditation<br />\nchant, it's short for Owings Mills<br />\nMall, also known as Owings<br />\nMills Town Center (at least it is<br />\non the exit sign from Route 795).<br />\nOwings Mills Mall is one of the<br />\nnewest shopping malls\u2014opening<br />\nthe summer of 1986\u2014in the area,<br />\nand also one of the best. And now<br />\nthat the Metro has opened up a<br />\nstop in Owings Mills, the mall is<br />\none of the most accessible to<br />\nHopkins students who have<br />\noutgrown (or outshopped) the<br />\nRotunda.<br />\nAs a piece of architecture, Owings Mills Mall is rather attractive, both inside and out. The<br />\nthree department stores (Hecht's,<br />\nMacy's, and Saks) are constructed in contrasting shades of<br />\nbrick, so the mall appears quite<br />\ndistinctive as you approach from<br />\nthe highway. The interior of the<br />\nmall is brass, glass, and marble,<br />\nwith escalators and big marble<br />\nstaircases connecting the two<br />\nlevels of shops.<br />\nSpeaking of shops, yes, Owings Mills does have the usual<br />\nassortment of \"mall shops\".<br />\nThere's a Gap, a Limited and an<br />\nExpress, and Esprit shop, and a<br />\nBenetton. However, Owings<br />\nMills does have many stores that<br />\naren't quite as common in the<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore area\u2014and possibly<br />\nmany others, including clothing<br />\nand novelty stores, and places to<br />\neat.<br />\nFirst, there's the Banana<br />\nRepublic (one of two in the area),<br />\nwhich is notable not so much for<br />\nthe safari and military-style<br />\nclothes inside, as it is for the truly original window display outside. This features a jeep crashing<br />\nthrough the front window of the<br />\nshop, with grass and rocks at the<br />\nbase.<br />\nFor those into \"trendier\" type<br />\nfashions, there's Cignal on the<br />\nlower level and Le Chateau on the<br />\nupper. Cignal is the more expensive of the two, but they tend to<br />\ncarry name designers and are a bit<br />\nmore high-fashion. They also<br />\nhave some really neat accesories<br />\nand jewelry. Le Chateau, on the<br />\nother hand, carries the sort of<br />\nclothes one is likely to see on<br />\nyoung Europeans\u2014classy but not<br />\noutrageously expensive.<br />\nThis reporter doesn't claim to<br />\nbe a great expert on men's<br />\nfashions, but from most appearances, there seem to be nice<br />\nthings to be had in Webster and<br />\nthe Cedar Post, as well as the<br />\naforementioned Banana Republic<br />\nand the Gap. You might also want<br />\nto check out the department<br />\nstores\u2014they might surprise you.<br />\nWhile we're on the subject of<br />\nthe department stores\u2014a brief<br />\n<br />\nword about them should be said.<br />\nThe branches of Macy's and<br />\nHecht's at Owings Mills are probably the best in the Baltimore<br />\narea and Saks is the only Saks in<br />\nthe Baltimore area. Occasionally they have pretty good sales, so<br />\nthey're worth checking out.<br />\nIf you're into gadgets and<br />\nnovelties, there are good places<br />\nfor them as well. Brookstone on<br />\nthe upper level has gadgets aplenty; from traveling items to<br />\ncalculators to radios to games to 3<br />\ngeneral curiosities. It's a place sE)<br />\nthat you walk through and c\u00b03<br />\nwonder either \"Why didn't someone think of this sooner?\" or<br />\n\"What will they think of next?\"<br />\nDallas Alice, which is also on the<br />\nupper level, but near the Conservatory (the food hall), is a great<br />\nplace for neat T-shirts, cards, and<br />\nother novelties. They also have<br />\nsome unusual jewelry in their<br />\njewelry case, but it's the T-shirts<br />\nthat are probably the most fun, interesting item inside.<br />\nWell, now that you've done all<br />\nthis shopping, you're probably<br />\npretty hungry. Have no fear,<br />\nthere's something at Owings<br />\nMills to satisfy just about any<br />\npalate. Besides the Conservatory,<br />\nwhich is where most of the<br />\neateries are situated, there are<br />\nalso a few other places scattered<br />\nthroughout the mall. The Conservatory has many small places<br />\n<br />\nwhere you can order and pick up deed be called \"trendy\")food.<br />\nThere are many more things to<br />\nfast food\u2014there are burger<br />\nplaces, a deli, a bagel place, a see and to buy in Owings Mills,<br />\nyogurt place, and counters that which time and space do not perspecialize in Chinese food, mit me to cover, for instance, the<br />\nPhilippine cooking, and turkey two bookstores\u2014which carry a<br />\ndishes. There's also a cafeteria pretty large stock of imported<br />\nand a sit-down restaurant, Ruby magazines between them; the two<br />\nTuesday, that has everything record shops; and the numerous<br />\nfrom Cajun to Teriyaki. The sur- clothing, shoe, and food stores<br />\nroundings in the Conservatory are not mentioned.

Usually.<br />\nWhen I lived in Building A two<br />\nyears ago, I noticed that my<br />\nroommate and I were the same<br />\nheight, as were my two<br />\nsuitemates. I discovered later that<br />\nin my dorm, nearly all pairs of<br />\nroommates had approximately the<br />\nsame height.<br />\nDormitory Assistant Trish<br />\nCovell offered an explanation.<br />\n\"The only thing I've ever heard<br />\nabout this is that there is a level<br />\nof comfort in similarity,\" she<br />\nsaid. \"Therefore, a short person<br />\nmay feel uncomfortable with a<br />\ntall person.\"<br />\nShe said that most freshmen are<br />\nassigned roommates by computer. \"They're assigned to a<br />\nbuilding of their choice, if possi-<br />\n<br />\nRichard Bell<br />\n<br />\nby Jon Stempel<br />\n<br />\nble, and then all questionnaires go<br />\ndown to the computer center,\"<br />\nshe said. \"We have computer<br />\nmatch-up software.\"<br />\nThe Housing Office collects<br />\ndata for the computer from questionnaires distributed during the<br />\nsummer that ask freshmen questions about their living style and<br />\nstudy habits\u2014and height.<br />\nOf the questions, said Covell,<br />\nthe question on smoking habits<br />\n<br />\ncarries the greatest weight.

On the latter, Covell explained, \"When you're dealing.with a<br />\ndouble room which has a limited<br />\namount of space, there's a greater<br />\nneed for compact furniture.<br />\nWe're looking for the most personal space possible.\"<br />\nBecause the furniture' is<br />\nmodular, dormitory residents can<br />\narrange their furniture in many<br />\nways without leaving gaps between any two pieces, and can use<br />\nthe bolts provided with the furniture when necessary.<br />\nCovell advised that students<br />\n= \"shouldn't attempt an unusual arrangement [of the furniture]<br />\n\u25aa without having maintenance<br />\n.5<br />\n- check it to make sure it isn't<br />\ncc dangerous.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Our Council is definitely<br />\nstudent-service oriented .<br />\nthink last year's Student Council<br />\nwas more of a forum for political<br />\ndebate. -I'd like to get away from<br />\nthat; that is not what we are here<br />\nfor,\" vowed Student Council<br />\nPresident Scott FitzGerald in an<br />\ninterview with the Nevi's- Letter<br />\nlast week.<br />\nIn addition to the particular<br />\nphilosophy he hoped would<br />\ncharacterize his tenure, FitzGerald discussed various areas in<br />\nwhich the Council aspires to initiate change this year, including<br />\nhousing, student services and<br />\nsocial events.<br />\nFitzGerald hopes the Council's<br />\nagenda will develop in keeping<br />\nwith its official purpose, that is,<br />\n\"to improve undergraduate life<br />\nand act as a bridge between<br />\nstudents and the University<br />\nadministration.\"<br />\n\"I feel one of my primary<br />\nduties is to do things on a one-toone level. . .to have students.<br />\ncome to me and say 'Fitz\u2014we<br />\nhave a problem, what can you<br />\ndo?'

Sadly for those<br />\nstudents addicted to the notion of<br />\nimbibing freely throughout college, such is not to be at Hopkins.<br />\nSince the State of Maryland raised its drinking age from 18 to 21<br />\nin 1982, the campus (at Johns<br />\nHopkins) has been, for all intensive purposes, \"dry\". Simply<br />\nput, Maryland law prohibits the<br />\n<br />\npossession or consumption of<br />\nalcoholic beverages by persons<br />\nunder the age of 21\u2014a law which<br />\nobviously affects a majority of<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe ramifications of such a law<br />\nextend into all areas of campus<br />\nlife\u2014certainly there are restrictions on social events by the HOP<br />\n(Hopkins Office of Programs)<br />\nand other campus groups. But<br />\nperhaps the law poses the most<br />\nunique difficulties for students sequesteced in the dormitories, who.<br />\nmay feel constrained by the arms<br />\nof both Maryland law and<br />\nadministrators<br />\nUniversity<br />\nreaching into their private living<br />\nareas. Is there any justice?<br />\nUnfortunately, the law is the<br />\nlaw and not even Hopkins<br />\nstudents are above. The University rok in enforcing that law is<br />\n<br />\nfairly clear-. According to Andrea<br />\nPerry, Director of Residential<br />\nLife, \"The University has an<br />\nobligation to have its residents<br />\nunderstand the law. . .they are<br />\nresponsible for their own<br />\nbehavior. Further, we have a<br />\nresponsibility to police\u2014<br />\nconsumption and possession in<br />\npublic\u2014we will confiscate such<br />\nalcohol.\"<br />\nHowever, Perry continued,<br />\n\"we feel students have a right to<br />\nprivacy. It isn't our sense that we<br />\nought to invade on private<br />\nareas. . .but if we have a sense<br />\nthat a student is abusive. . .we<br />\nwill intervene.\" The persons<br />\nspecifically authorized to intervene are the housemasters and<br />\nstaff members of Residential<br />\nLife.<br />\nThe actions taken if illegal<br />\n<br />\nN\u2014L<br />\nWe do more between midnight<br />\nand 3 a.m. than most people do<br />\nall day.<br />\nIf you talk to an editor at work<br />\nin the News-Letter production at<br />\n2 a.m. on any given day, he or<br />\nshe will leave you no doubt as to<br />\nthe truth of the statement.<br />\nOne of the oldest Hopkins institutions (after Dr. Gryder, of<br />\ncourse), the News-Letter began,<br />\nin 1897, as a bi-weekly journal<br />\nprinted on book-quality paper,<br />\nwith an unheard of price of ten<br />\ncents. As with any organization<br />\nof such advanced years, the<br />\nNews-Letter has undergone<br />\nnumerous changes in style and<br />\npurpose.<br />\nNow a free weekly paper with<br />\na circulation of 6,000, the NewsLetter is arguably the most influential student organization on<br />\ncampus (at least we would argue<br />\nit), providing news of campus interest, features on student life,<br />\nand information on everything<br />\nelse, both in and out of Baltimore.<br />\nWe even have a comic strip that<br />\n<br />\nsubstances are discovered are<br />\nhighly dependent on the circumstances explained Perry. The<br />\npenalties would range from community service to social probation<br />\nto recommendations for therapy<br />\nto severe disciplinary actions such<br />\nas expulsion, and are enacted<br />\nunder the authority of the Office<br />\nof the Dean of Students.<br />\nOn the whole, the drinking age<br />\ntransition over the past six years<br />\nhas been fairly smooth. \"There<br />\nhas been less abusive behavior<br />\nconnected to drinking than there<br />\nused to be\u2014less vandalism, altercations, injuries, hospitalization,\" notes Perry, \"but students<br />\nare forced to drink in private ...it<br />\nis unfortunate that they have lost<br />\nthe ability to drink positively in<br />\na social setting.\"<br />\nHousemasters attest to the<br />\n<br />\nsmooth transition, despite the unpopular role of \"confiscator\"<br />\nthey are traditionally thrust into.<br />\nAdams Housemaster Molly Bardsley feels that the freshmen have<br />\nabout<br />\ngood<br />\nquite<br />\nbeen<br />\ncooperating with University<br />\npolicies. \"The freshmen tend to<br />\nbe very reasonable with regard to<br />\nrespecting the authority of the<br />\nhousemasters. They understand<br />\nthat it's what we have to be.\"<br />\nFinally, while recognizing the<br />\ndifficulties of reconciling collegiate drinking expectations with<br />\nlaw and reality, Perry offers a<br />\nword of advice. \"Drinking is not<br />\nan essential ingredient for a good<br />\ntime...If you think it is, you are<br />\ndetermined to drink. . . be aware<br />\nyou are doing,so as an adult and<br />\nhave adult resonsibilities for your<br />\nactions.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhere to turn<br />\nEach year, many freshmen find<br />\nthemselves overwhelmed by the<br />\nsocial, personal, and acadmeic<br />\npressures of'surviving' their first<br />\nyear of college.

The book<br />\nwas hailed as a landmark for a<br />\nwasteland, and the author, twenty at the time, a senior at Bennington College, was celebrated as<br />\nthe voice of his generation. Time<br />\nmagazine noted this summer that<br />\nEllis and fellow hipster Jay<br />\nMcInerney had become pals, as<br />\nif that relationship would influence the course of contemporary literature. While there is<br />\nthe dangerous proverbial kernel<br />\nof truth to the hackneyed phrases<br />\nof praises, fame has obscured the<br />\ngenuine strengths of Ellis'<br />\nwriting.<br />\nLess Than Zero is an impressive debut. The novel traces<br />\nthe return of rich kid Clay to Los<br />\nAngeles from an East coast college. Home for the holidays, Clay<br />\nfinds that people are still up to,<br />\n\"Oh, like the usual. Going to<br />\nNautilus, getting smashed, going<br />\nto this Uva place [a tanning salon]<br />\n\" Doing drugs, forgetting<br />\nwith whom they have slept, seeing analysts and going shopping:<br />\nin this novel, money buys such<br />\npleasures for Clay and his peers.<br />\nWhat there is of a story concerns Clay and Blair, an exgirlfriend. As the novel opens,<br />\nshe picks him up from the airport<br />\nand declares, \"people are afraid<br />\nto merge on freeways in Los<br />\n<br />\nAngeles.\" As the novel takes the<br />\nreader through an utterly burntout reality, this statement<br />\npresumably takes on much<br />\ngreater significance.<br />\nThe major episodes of Clay's<br />\nvacation involve some friends<br />\nwho have been keeping a twelve<br />\nyear-old girl for their amusement;<br />\nhomosexual prostitution; and finding a dead body. Clay is cool,<br />\nhardly caring about any of this,<br />\nbut on a visit to his psychiatrist,<br />\n\"coming off from coke, sneezing<br />\nblood,\" the doctor asks him<br />\nabout Elvis Costello and he asks<br />\nback,\"'what about me?'\"<br />\n\"'What about you?\"<br />\n\"What about me?\"<br />\n\u2014 You'll be fine.\"<br />\n\"I don't know,' I say.

Don't be<br />\nso mundane.\"<br />\nLater Clay, disinterested more<br />\nthan anything else, asks his friend<br />\nwho has the captive twelve yearold, \u2014Oh shit . . . what don't you<br />\nhave?\"<br />\ndon't have anything to<br />\nlose.\"<br />\nAnd the reader has little to lose<br />\nor gain from this sordid story.<br />\nAlthough Ellis does display a<br />\nmastery of his chosen venue, his<br />\ntone is neutral and so ends up exalting in the situation it presents,<br />\nrather than offering any comment. There is certainly not<br />\nenough humanity for the upcoming movie version to present Clay<br />\nas somewhat of a moral fellow<br />\ntrying to rescue his friends from<br />\ntheir own angst, as has been<br />\nreported. That would require an<br />\nincredible talent for revision, or<br />\ngreat tolerance for the Clay's<br />\nbrand of sickly melancholy,<br />\nwhich he believes to be strong,<br />\nmature emotion. The bands,<br />\nclothes, MTV and videogames<br />\n<br />\nare out already and the story is<br />\ndated, so what is offered by Less<br />\nThan Zero? One of the best<br />\ndocuments of the era. Stripped of<br />\nthe hype, taken as a first novel instead of a masterpiece, set into<br />\nperspective, yes, the work has a<br />\ncertain on-the-edge quality as a<br />\nreport on our own frightening<br />\nculture and as a demonstration of<br />\ntaut writing rather than as serious<br />\nliterature.<br />\nFrom the slight historical vantage that is now available, the<br />\nquestion that the novel presents is<br />\nwhether or not Ellis can carry his<br />\nwork by slick writing alone. After<br />\nall, hipster doomsday sentimentality wears well only for those<br />\nwho die young.<br />\nUnfortunately, with his second<br />\nbook, Rules of Attraction, Ellis<br />\nshows that he prefers working in<br />\na disPollyanna vacuum. The new<br />\nnovel is one of the worst works<br />\nof fiction ever published.<br />\nIt tells of a group of apathetic<br />\nstudents at Camden, the small<br />\nliberal arts college in New<br />\nEngland, Less Than Zero Clay's<br />\nschool. Clay doesn't appear until late in the book, but among his<br />\npeers, there is Lauren, who can't<br />\nget over her ex-boyfriend Victor,<br />\nand who is distinguished (barely)<br />\nby her changing majors all of the<br />\ntime. The dustjacket praises Paul<br />\nas a bisexual \"whose passion<br />\nmasks a shrewd pragmatism,\" as<br />\nis demonstrated by his reaction to<br />\na someone bursting into his room<br />\nbefore a big date with news of a<br />\nsuicide attempt: \"He looked like<br />\nhe was going to cry and he gave<br />\nthis event (a Freshman suicide?<br />\noh, please) a dimension of unwarranted emotion.\" Sean, with<br />\nwhom Paul sleeps, because he<br />\nowns a motorcycle, is the central<br />\ncharacater. His attitude sums up<br />\nthe novel: \"Yeah. I'm going to<br />\nthe party tonight. You going .0<br />\nthe<br />\ntonight?\"'.<br />\nparty<br />\nMeaningless.<br />\nEllis uses a format of short<br />\n<br />\nAfter discovering success with his first novel, Less Than Zero, Bret Easton<br />\nEllis continues his streak in The Rules ofAttraction.<br />\nepisodes, switching points of<br />\nview to no great effect, making<br />\nit only more difficult to iort out<br />\nthe empty affairs and petty concerns of each character. The<br />\nchore is hardly worth the effort,<br />\nespecially since Ellis repeats<br />\nscenes with the same may-aswell-be-dead tone.<br />\nWere the novel to be redeemed by anything, it would be witticisms, trademark minimalist<br />\nsarcasm. The trouble is that, in<br />\nthis novel, what are intende,i as<br />\npointed observations are talc tall<br />\ntoo seriously by the characters<br />\nand the author, as they wonder<br />\nwho the secret admirer is and<br />\nwhat will happen at The Dressed<br />\nTo Get Screwed party (there is no<br />\nfurther plot). Clay, for example,<br />\nrecasts his opening line from the<br />\nlast novel, concluding that people<br />\nare afraid to merge on campus.<br />\nVictor: \"I didn't know where I<br />\nwas. Everything was full of<br />\ntourists. So I went to this nude<br />\nbeach.

She'd come<br />\nback from these excursions<br />\necstatic, claiming that. . .she was<br />\ntruly one of 'Jerry's kids.'

It<br />\nrepresents no particular moral<br />\nstand to criticize this, for the<br />\ncharacters are amoral, without<br />\neven an articulate amorality. So<br />\nengrossed in fast living are the<br />\ncollege students that inhabit<br />\nEllisland, they would be unlikely to read even Less Than Zero,<br />\nor Rules of Attraction. Yuppies<br />\nat least work. The Ellis children<br />\nlead lives that are a blur; their<br />\nstory is worthless. The style does<br />\nnot even hold the seamless quality that was so admired in the first<br />\nnovel.<br />\nThe greater crime here is not<br />\nthat Ellis espouses some sort of<br />\nheinous lifestyle (which he does,<br />\nby most standards), but that he<br />\ndoes a lousy job of telling a story.<br />\nHis characters don't care. Why<br />\nshould the reader?<br />\nEllis perhaps realizes what he<br />\nis doing: Sean and Lauren attend<br />\na party at her poetry teacher's<br />\nhouse, where they meet Stump<br />\n(\"Used to be Carcass but changed it\"), and have an interesting<br />\ndiscussion on writing. Stump is a<br />\npoet who has learned his art from<br />\nBlack Flag and he is writing a<br />\nseries about bestiality. \"I'm<br />\nworking on the dog section now<br />\nwhere this guy ties a dog up and<br />\nis having intercourse with it<br />\nbecause He thinks dog is God. D.G-0-D. God spelled<br />\nO-G<br />\nbackwards. Get it? See?\"<br />\nAnother artist asks whether this<br />\n\"post-Vietman, post-Watergate,<br />\npost- . . . hell, post-everything\"<br />\nwriting is worthwhile, or just<br />\n\"bogus.\"<br />\nWere Ellis to apply his not inconsiderable stylistic skill to a<br />\nworthwhile story, he would begin<br />\nto live up to the gushing he has<br />\ninspired. Rules of Attraction,<br />\nhowever, is deserving of not even<br />\nfaint and fading praise.<br />\n<br />\n\f14/SEPTEMBER 18. 1987<br />\n<br />\nLEAVE A VOID<br />\nIN THE<br />\nNOID<br />\nClip ibis coupon off the<br />\nNOID's face and call<br />\nDomino's Pizza now!<br />\nWe Avoid The NOID<br />\nand make pizza just the<br />\nway you want it.<br />\n2724 Remington Ave<br />\nPhone 338-2500<br />\nOpen for lunch<br />\n11 am-1 am Sun-Thurs.<br />\n11 am-2 am Fri & Sat<br />\nOur drivers carry less<br />\nthan $20.00<br />\nLimited delivery area.<br />\n1987 Dominos P,zza.

The beaches<br />\nwill be thronged again next year,<br />\nhowever, with men and women<br />\nof all ages pursuing that \"ultimate<br />\ntan.\" Though a seemingly innocuous activity compared to<br />\nmost American leisure time activities, dermatologists and oncologists have issued their warnings once more about the dangers<br />\nand serious consequences of<br />\nbasking your body with rays.<br />\nThe numbers . are not<br />\nencouraging\u2014 500,000 cases of<br />\nnonmelanoma skin cancer will<br />\nprobably be diagnosed this year,<br />\naccording to the Skin Cancer<br />\nFoundation. Further, skin cancer<br />\nis not to be taken lightly either,<br />\nas so many Americans seem to be<br />\n<br />\ndoing. There will be 2000 deaths<br />\nthis year due to untreated<br />\nnonmelanoma skin cancers, a<br />\nnumber which does not account<br />\nfor cases in which overexposure<br />\nto the sun has caused serious<br />\ntissue damage, or caused irretrievable loss of eye or brain<br />\nfunction.<br />\n<br />\nTry now, pay later...'<br />\n<br />\nWhat makes matters worse is<br />\nthat the problem seems to be getting worse, with the rising<br />\npopulation in the Sun-belt states<br />\nand the continued idealization of<br />\n\"California culture\" which<br />\nidolizes fun-in-the-sun activities.<br />\n<br />\n12J11 VaaLLICite<br />\nL&E LILL IDLIVT<br />\nCompiled from local dermatologists and medical agency literature.<br />\nHere's a summary of do's and don'ts<br />\nto follow when out there pursuing the<br />\nultimate tan or even just being outside<br />\non a bright day:<br />\n**I()apply sunscreen when you expect<br />\nto be in the sun for any extended period<br />\nof time. The beach, ski slopes,<br />\nlakesides, etc.. are all areas where<br />\nsunscreens should be used.<br />\n<br />\n**DO apply moisturizers to your skin<br />\nif you do burn. There will still be skin<br />\ndamage, hut it is a little less painful if<br />\nyou apply lotion to the burn. Those with<br />\naloe-vera are particularly recommended, whereas cold creams are generally<br />\nnot.<br />\n**DO wear sunglasses in the sun and<br />\nmake sure they are able to filter out UV<br />\nrays.

The \"Beach \u2014 in front<br />\nof MSE has had over 100 people<br />\non many a sunny weekend.<br />\nSuntanning is, medically speaking, an absorption of ultraviolet<br />\nrays from sunlight or artificially<br />\ninduced light that causes the skin<br />\ncells in our bodies to produce<br />\nmelanin, a dark pigment which<br />\ncauses our skin to tan. Too much<br />\nof that sun will dehydratt- the skin<br />\nand kill the cells in the skin's<br />\nouter layer.<br />\nWe are all exposed to the sun<br />\nto some extent. and a fair amount<br />\nof sunlight is undoubtedly<br />\nhealthy, contributing items such<br />\nas vitamin D for our body's use.<br />\nThe concern, however, is that<br />\npeople generally do not know<br />\ntheir limits and overexpose<br />\nthemselves. That doesn't just<br />\nmean burning, however. Even if<br />\nyou never burn, you may be<br />\nreceiving too much ultraviolet<br />\nradiation and so may suffer later<br />\nfrom some of the diseases<br />\nassociated with too much radiation, cancers being the most<br />\nserious.<br />\nThere is no. cause for alarm,<br />\nsun-seekers, but there is a list of<br />\nprecautions which dermatologists<br />\nand the Skin Cancer Foundation<br />\nrecommend following<br />\nto<br />\nminimize your risk (see box).<br />\nMost physicians agree that<br />\nreasonable adherence to these<br />\nseem-<br />\n<br />\nmeasures will ensure healthy skin<br />\nfor most of one's life and prevent<br />\nthe dreaded diseases and<br />\npremature wrinkling that have<br />\nbeen seen in increasing numbers.<br />\nMany outdoors types have<br />\noverlooked these safe and simple<br />\nrules, unfortunately, and dermatologists have seen the average<br />\nage of skin cancer nose dive from<br />\nthe 60's to the 30's. President<br />\nReagan is an example of a<br />\nSouthern Californian with skin<br />\ncancer problems, but many doctors have claimed that some<br />\nCalifornians have had to deal with<br />\nthe skin-salvaging procedures<br />\nsuch as surgery at half the President's age.<br />\nThere is another controversy in<br />\nthe tanning picture these days,<br />\nand it revolves around the popular<br />\nuse of tanning salons. Nationally<br />\npopular, and doing quite well in<br />\nthe Baltimore area as well, these<br />\nsalons have become increasingly<br />\nfrequented by tanners, particularly in the off season. Lynn'<br />\nKowalski, manager of the Offthe-Beach Tanning Spa, a<br />\nBaltimore area tanning salon,<br />\nreports that tanning \"is a thriving business. We get all kinds of<br />\npeople, men and women who are<br />\nlooking to keep up their tan or get<br />\nready with a base tan before they<br />\nvacation.\" Tanning sessions,<br />\nwhich take place in a booth,<br />\nwhere the tanner relaxes for a<br />\nshort amount of time under UV<br />\nlights, provide many people with<br />\nthe delightful result of a yearround tan.<br />\nCautious about the proliferaton<br />\nof the tanning salons is Dr. Paul<br />\n<br />\nStrickland, assistant professor of<br />\nenvironmental health science at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins School of<br />\nPublic Health. His concerns are<br />\nthat many of the tanning salons do<br />\nnot provide adequate protection<br />\nand information to their.<br />\ncustomers. Furthermore, most<br />\ntanning salons only use lamps<br />\nwhich produce UV-A light,<br />\nunlike the sun, which produces.<br />\nUV-A and UV-If. Strickland feels<br />\nthat many people who get their<br />\ntans at salons unwittingly expose<br />\nthemselves to long hours in the<br />\nsun, thinking that their base tans<br />\nwill protect theni, when in reality they will not. Strickland would<br />\nlike to see more regulation of<br />\nthese spas.<br />\nFor all the concerns of Dr.<br />\nStrickland, however, Ms.<br />\nKowalski points to a pleased<br />\nclientele and has few people who<br />\nburn or experience bad aftereffects. In addition, Off-theBeach provides goggles for its<br />\npatrons and sets tanning times to<br />\nprevent overexposure of zealous<br />\ntanners.<br />\nTanners are here to stay, admit<br />\nmost dermatologists, and it's very<br />\nhard to fight a trend that all the<br />\nbeautiful people seem to be doing. Their hope, however, is that<br />\nmost people will at least be aware<br />\nof the danger and take at least<br />\nminimal precautions to save their<br />\nskin.

Doctors used hypothermia and a heart/lung<br />\nbypass machine in order to drain<br />\nthe blood vessels and inactivate<br />\nthe heart and circulatory systems<br />\nfor about an hour. This allowed<br />\nphysicians to separate the major<br />\nsinus vein (located near the brain)<br />\nthat the twins shared.

The game, held before<br />\n17,077 \u2022 spectators at Rutgers<br />\nStadium in Piscataway, NJ, was<br />\ntied five times, with Cornell<br />\nleading only once, during the<br />\ntenth minute of the first quarter.<br />\nGoldstein, who registered two<br />\ngoals and six assists in the final,<br />\nwas named the tournament's most<br />\nvaluable player.<br />\nHopkins and Cornell traded<br />\ngoals in the fourth quarter until<br />\ntwo minutes were left, when Cornell goalie Paul Schimoler stopped a point-blank shot by Bubier.<br />\n.In a long clear intended for an attackman to the right of the<br />\nHopkins goal, Blue Jay<br />\ngoaltender Quint Kessenich came<br />\nout of his net and intercepted the<br />\npass. Passing to midfielder John<br />\nDressel, Kessenich started the<br />\nHopkins fastbreak that resulted in<br />\nthe game winner by Bubier from<br />\n<br />\nN L archives<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins knocked off unbeaten Maryland in the NCAA Semifinals, avenging their earlier defeat at College Park.<br />\n15 yards out.<br />\n\"Schimoler had snuffed me<br />\ntwice earlier, and I was really<br />\nmotivated,\" said Bubier, a sincegraduated senior who scored four<br />\ntimes in the final. \"I wanted that<br />\ngoal.\"<br />\nBut all danger had not yet subsided for Hopkins. Because of a<br />\n30-second holding penalty on<br />\n<br />\n1987 Lax All-Americans<br />\nSteve Mitchell<br />\nDave Retramala<br />\nBrian Wood<br />\nLarry LeDoyen<br />\nMike Morrill<br />\nCraig Bubier<br />\nQuint Kessenich<br />\nP<br />\n<br />\n1st team midfield<br />\n1st team defense<br />\n1st team attack<br />\n2nd team midfield<br />\n3rd team attack<br />\nHonorable mention attack<br />\nHonorable mention goalie<br />\n<br />\nsenior defenseman Steve Mitchell, the Jays were'forced to play<br />\nmuch of the last minute a man<br />\ndown. But the Hopkins defense<br />\nstiffened, not allowing the Big<br />\nRed a single shot, as the returning Mitchell stripped the ball<br />\nfrom Goldstein with three<br />\nseconds left, icing the victory.<br />\nThe two teams combined for 84<br />\nshots and 36 saves, 15 by,<br />\nSchimoler and 21 by Hopkins<br />\ngoalie Kessenich, a freshman out<br />\nof Lynbrook, Long Island.<br />\n\"He was superb,\" said Goldstein on Kessenich. \"A wall in the<br />\nfirst half. I had two shots I was<br />\nsure went in, but he got them.\"<br />\nGoldstein estimated that by the<br />\ntime the shooting was over, five<br />\nBig Red shots hit the Hopkins<br />\nposts.<br />\nIn addition to the four goals by<br />\nBubier, two were scored by Brian<br />\n<br />\nJoe Cher,<br />\n<br />\nCraig Bubier led the Jays in scoring and added four scores in the Finals against Cornell at Rutgers.<br />\n<br />\nWood, and one each by Mike ,<br />\nMorrill, Larry LeDoyen, John<br />\nDressel, John Wilkens, and John<br />\nCiccarone, who came with 2:11<br />\nleft in the fourth quarter.<br />\nFor Bubier and Wood, the final<br />\nmarked the end of a long collaboration starting when the two<br />\nplayed together for some years at<br />\nSt. Mary's High School in<br />\nBaltimore. Wood ended his<br />\ncareer at Hopkins with 100 goals<br />\nand 78 assists, while Bubier<br />\nscored 92 goals and 31 assists.<br />\nThe win over second-seeded<br />\nCornell marked the final appearance for seven graduating<br />\nseniors: co-captains Bubier and<br />\nmidfielder Bruce Chanenchuk,<br />\nStuart Jones, Mike Webster, Mitchell, Wood, and LeDoyen(who<br />\nscored 19 goals,and 15 assists for<br />\nthe Jays in '87). Jones was the<br />\nstarting goalie for Hopkins.<br />\nthroughout the entire 1986<br />\nseason, when Hopkins lost in the<br />\nsemi-final to North Carolina<br />\n11-10 in overtime.<br />\nIn 1988, the Jays will retain the<br />\nservices of senior Mike<br />\nMorrill\u2014who led Hopkins in<br />\nscoring in 1987 with 31 goals and<br />\n16 assists\u2014and junior Brendan<br />\nKelly (15 goals, 10 assists).<br />\nThe Blue Jays qualified for the<br />\nchampionship game after one of<br />\ntheir most exciting season ever.<br />\nAfter losing the opener 15-14 at<br />\nSyracuse, Hopkins defeated<br />\nRutgers 10-7 and then routed both<br />\nWashington<br />\nCollege and<br />\nPrinceton. But a 9-7 home loss to<br />\nVirginia put the Jays at 3-2, while<br />\nboth Cornell and Maryland were<br />\nposting undefeated seasons.<br />\nAn 11-10 victory over North<br />\nCarolina at Chapel Hill and an<br />\n11-9 home win over Army seemed to stabilize the situation, but<br />\nthe Blue Jays then lost to<br />\nundefeated Maryland at College<br />\nPark, 11-7. And 10-9 and 13-7<br />\n<br />\nwins over Navy and Towson<br />\nState respectively were not convincing enough to earn the Jays<br />\na seed any higher than fourth in<br />\nthe NCAA tournament, behind<br />\nand<br />\nCornell,<br />\nMaryland,<br />\nSyracuse.<br />\nHopkins' quarterfinal win over<br />\nNorth Carolina at Homewood<br />\nshould rank among the most exciting lacrosse games ever. The<br />\n11-10 outcome has been described as \"closer than the score indicated.\"<br />\nBrendan Kelly, on an assist<br />\nfrom Wood, tied the score at 10<br />\nwith 4:17 remaining in the fourth<br />\nquarter. Shortly thereafter, midfielder Dressel picked up a loose<br />\nball at his restraining line and<br />\nfired a cross-field pass to Mitchell, who ran the ball across<br />\nmidfield and passed to Bubier on<br />\nright wing. Drawing the UNC<br />\ndefense close to him, Bubier passed to Morrill in front of the net,<br />\nwho scored his sixth goal of the<br />\ngame.<br />\nCarolina had an opportunity to<br />\ntie the game with under a minute<br />\nto play. From ten yards out, UNC<br />\nattackman Steve Cox's shot was<br />\nstopped by Kessenich, the<br />\nfreshman's 22nd save of the game<br />\nand fourth superb one in the last<br />\nthree minutes.<br />\n\"I just tried to be in good position and keep my eye on the<br />\nball,\" Kessenich said.<br />\nLess than a week later, at<br />\nRutgers, Hopkins defeated<br />\nMaryland 13-8, the first of two<br />\nundefeated teams the Jays would<br />\nbeat for the championship.<br />\nThe tournament victory marked the 42nd national championship for Johns Hopkins lacrosse.<br />\nIn the 17 years since the NCAA<br />\ntournament was originated,<br />\nHopkins has appeared in the final<br />\n13 times.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/19<br />\n<br />\nuxik Peacocks go limp on Jays Friday night<br />\nLLLL<br />\n<br />\nPete's effort lasts 20 seconds, thanks to 12 sacks<br />\n<br />\nThe Sports Section needed<br />\nby Michael J.

So<br />\nthe Blue Jays left Elizabethtown,<br />\nPA with a disappointing 21-12f<br />\nfinal record and faint hopes of<br />\nreceiving an NCAA Tournament<br />\nbid. The bid never came, and the<br />\nteam's disappointment grew<br />\nwhen a long-awaited pair of exhibition games with a team from<br />\nCuba was cancelled at the last<br />\nminute.<br />\nThe Hopkins baseball team had<br />\nproblems from the start. They<br />\nlost four of their first five and<br />\nlooked bad doing it. The Jays<br />\nblew their season-opening game<br />\nagainst Yale by yielding six runs<br />\nto the Bulldogs after two were out<br />\nin the seventh inning. Hopkins<br />\nthen lost again to Yale, had a<br />\ngame with Coppin State suspended due to darkness, were crushed 15-1 by UMBC,and lost 14-7<br />\nto Tufts. Already the Jays had lost<br />\nfour games. A year earlier,<br />\nHopkins had a final record of<br />\n33-5-1, and did not lose their<br />\nfourth game until the thirty-sixth<br />\ngame of the season. A team that<br />\nwas supposed to win, that expected to win, was not winning.<br />\nThe Blue Jays continued to struggle and had a 6-7 record before<br />\nthey came to life and won 15 of<br />\ntheir last 20 contests, but their<br />\n21-12 final record was not good<br />\nenough for an NCAA bid.<br />\nThe main culprits in Hopkins'<br />\nlosses were poor pitching and<br />\neven worse defense. The team's<br />\nERA was 6.42 at the season's<br />\nhalfway mark before recovering<br />\n<br />\nsomewhat to finish at 4.76. The<br />\nBlue Jays' defense committed 47<br />\nerrors in the first 16 games. The<br />\ndefense improved somewhat<br />\nbefore concluding the '87 season<br />\nwith five errors against Franklin<br />\nand Marshall, five errors against<br />\nUMBC, and four errors against<br />\nGettysburg in the MAC playoffs.<br />\nThe defense allowed a total of 72<br />\nunearned runs to score.<br />\nHopkins' offense, however,<br />\nwas anything but a weakness in<br />\n'87. As a team, they hit .318,<br />\nwith a slugging percentage of<br />\n.459 and an on-base percentage of<br />\n.415. The offense was unstoppable at times, banging out scores<br />\nof 30, 26, 19, 18, 15, 14, 13, 12<br />\nand 10 runs..

The<br />\nlineup was filled with experienced players returning from a team<br />\nwhich lost only three games in<br />\n1986. Most people expected the<br />\nBlue Jays to be among the top<br />\nteams in the MAC,and an NCAA<br />\nTournament berth seemed to be<br />\nwithin their grasps. Indeed,<br />\nHopkins certainly seemed like a<br />\nteam that needed few adjustments.<br />\nYet, the first four games of the<br />\nseason have been disappointing<br />\nfor the Blue Jays, and they have<br />\nbeen marked by numerous adjustments. The most obvious<br />\nchange is a head coach where<br />\nJohn Haus begins his first year.<br />\nThe other big adjustments have<br />\nbeen on defense where a new<br />\ngoalie and a shuffling of<br />\ndefenders have contributed to the<br />\n2-2 start.<br />\nThe season began with a road<br />\nvictory over St. Mary's. Goals by<br />\nAndy Nicolas, Joe DalPorto, and<br />\nGreg Bronshvag boosted the Jays<br />\nto an easy 3-0 victory. This<br />\nshutout victory certainly gave no<br />\nindications of the defensive<br />\nbreakdown that would occur in<br />\nthe Elizabeth Tournament.<br />\nHopkins opened the tournament againstt-an extremely tough<br />\nregional foe, Christopher<br />\nNewport. In an important game<br />\nfor NCAA consideration, goals<br />\nby Grenville Jones and Craig<br />\nWeinstein were not enough to<br />\n<br />\n\"<br />\n<br />\nhold off the Newport onslaught,<br />\nas the Jays fell 4-2. In the next<br />\ngame, Hopkins faced a team from<br />\nCalifornia which they knew<br />\nnothing about. Once again, Jones<br />\ntallied for the Jays, but LaVerne<br />\nscored twice to hand Hopkins<br />\ntheir second straight defeat.<br />\n\"We're not making the other<br />\nteam work,\" said Coach Haus,<br />\n\"and we're giving up easy goals.<br />\nRight now, we're not playing as<br />\nwell as we are capable of<br />\nplaying.\"<br />\nIndeed, the defense has seen<br />\n<br />\nin time to live up to their preseason expectations?

Lee Davis<br /><br />\nFacing Change<br />\nThe opportunity for change presents<br />\nitself in all kinds of ways. This summer,<br />\ntwo men took the helm of the School of<br />\nArts and Sciences. The School's newly<br />\nappointed dean, Dr. Lloyd Armstrong,<br />\nbrings expertise from his former position as chairman of the Department of<br />\nPhysics and Astronomy; the new<br />\nassociate dean, Dr. P. Kyle McCarter,<br />\nprofessor in the Near Eastern Studies<br />\nDepartment, complements Armstrong<br />\nwith his humanities background.<br />\nArmstrong and McCarter, in taking<br />\nthese positions, assume responsibility<br />\nfor the academic climate at Homewood.<br />\nTheir experience, as well as the experience of their predecessors, can and<br />\nshould be implemented as they try to<br />\nascertain the status of education in the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences. However,<br />\nArmstrong and McCarter's experience<br />\ncomes from two faculty members'<br />\nperspectives. As they assume their new<br />\npositions, they will need to understand<br />\nthe concerns of all members of the<br />\nHopkins community.. Armstrong and<br />\nMcCarter might most effectively fill<br />\ntheir roles if they take what they have<br />\ngained here, organize it and hold it as<br />\nif under one arm, and keep the other<br />\nhand free to shake and greet new ideas<br />\nand challenges within the community.<br /><br />\nThis fall Hopkins will see yet another<br />\nnew face\u2014 the Mind-Brain Institute.<br />\nWhile this new program might seemingly be of little concern for Homewood<br />\nundergraduates, it could in the future be<br />\ninstrumental in helping alter the purposes and goals of the University.<br />\nEstablished as an attempt to bring<br />\ntogether the fields of neuroscience with<br />\nthe cognitive sciences, the Institute will<br />\nhouse the laboratories and offices of top<br />\nresearchers in fields such as<br />\nneurobiology and psychology. They<br />\nwill work together, investigating areas<br />\nsuch as memory, perception, movement<br />\ncontrol, and language.<br />\nWith the ever-increasing accumulation of all kinds of knowledge, scien-<br /><br />\ntists become more and more deeply entrenched in specialties of their field. It<br />\nis easy to lose sight of the ultimate purpose of scientific study: a continual attempt to improve, in all ways, the quality of life. The inter-departmental focus<br />\nof the Mind-Brain Institute will force<br />\nresearchers to step back from their own<br />\nprojects and study the ways in which information gathered from other fields can<br />\naid their own work.<br />\nPerhaps the Institute can lend itself\u2014<br />\nat least in principle\u2014 to the curricula for<br />\nthe Schools of Arts and Sciences and<br />\nEngineering. The inter-departmental approach obviously contributes greatly to<br />\nthe understanding of a given topic. It<br />\nalso serves as a vehicle by which a more<br />\nwell-rounded education is achieved.<br />\nThis approach would certainly<br />\nnecessitate a change in attitudes towards<br />\nacademics here, since many Hopkins<br />\nstudents tend to follow a preprofessional course of studies; such curricula are intense and very competitive<br />\nand leave little time for appreciation of<br />\nother fields. The implementation of this<br />\ntype of change is made more complex<br />\nby the Hopkins legacy of graduate<br />\nstudy. Historically, Hopkins was established as a research university in the<br />\nlikeness of the great European schools.<br />\nTaking into consideration our history,<br />\nthe shift towards a varied curriculum is<br />\nthat much more fundamental. Homewood Administrators, new and old,<br />\nshould consider the benefits of such<br />\nchanges without being reticent because<br />\nof its deviance from current attitudes.<br />\nOn the contrary, they should feel comfortable that the two approaches are<br />\ncompatible. For example, the University's strengths in independent study<br />\nprograms can lend itself just as easily<br />\nto inter-departmental research.<br />\nBoth the appointments in the School<br />\nof Arts and Sciences and the establishment of the Mind-Brain Institute present<br />\nthe potential for change, directly and indirectly, for the undergraduates at<br />\nHomewood. This potential should be<br />\nrealized.<br /><br />\nHome is where the heart is,<br />\ngenerally speaking of course.<br />\nMore likely home is where your<br />\nCD player is, where that cute set<br />\nof buns are, or in worst-case<br />\nscenarios, wherever you happen<br />\nto fall down. The old cliche<br />\n(which brings to mind Grandma<br />\nknitting by a fireplace, and other<br />\nemetic scenes of domesticated<br />\nlife) nevertheless contains a bit of<br />\ntruth. Everyone has a place, a<br />\nroom, a location that feels right<br />\nin some way, and it is only when<br />\nthis place is left that its importance is realized. Writers are told<br />\nthat if they would like to write<br />\nabout a place, the best thing to do<br />\nis to leave it.<br />\nLike many of my fellow<br />\nstudents, I find the academic year<br />\ninordinately long and tiresome. It<br />\nseems, in March, that May will<br />\nnever come. The middle of the<br />\nmonth will never arrive and<br />\nrelease me from Hopkins, allow<br />\nme to get into my car and make<br />\nthe 400 mile drive back up 95 to<br />\nRhode Island. Back to the ocean,<br />\nto dinner at Courtney's, and long<br />\nnights walking the crowded<br />\nstreets of Newport. Back to hull<br />\nspeed on the bay and lobster from<br />\nthe shell. Back to see friends from<br />\nthe neighborhood, from high<br />\nschool, people I've known for<br />\nyears.<br />\nAs the class of 1987 was being<br />\ncommenced, I arrived home and<br />\nbegan work for a computer company. Days and weeks passed in<br />\nquick, 8-hour segments. One day<br />\nin July, I found myself bogged in<br />\nthe usual beach traffic. Something<br />\nwas different however, and it<br />\nwasn't the fact that the plate<br />\nahead of me was from New York,<br />\nnot Jersey. As I inched forward,<br />\nmy clutch knee aching, scenes<br />\nfrom Spring Fair shot through my<br />\nmind. Could it be true? After a<br />\nmere two months could I actual-<br /><br />\nly be missing the place I had so<br />\nrecently called Hell?<br />\nI found the answer that afternoon. A young blonde kid, a high<br />\nschool junior, approached me as<br />\nI browsed through the local bike<br />\nshop.<br />\n\"A beauty,\" he said as I<br />\npolished a chromed handlebar<br />\nwith the tail of my shirt.<br />\n\"Sure is. She'd be great on the<br />\nhills.\"\u2022<br />\n\"Around here? What hills?<br />\nWhere are you from?\"<br />\n\"Baltimore. I'm here working<br />\nfor the summer.\"<br />\nI later found out that he had a<br />\nfriend from Connecticut who was<br />\nentering Hopkins to play<br />\nlacrosse. After the expected promise to \"look him up\" I left the<br />\nshop. The kid suggested that I<br />\nride my bike back to Baltimore,<br />\nsince the North to South trip<br />\n\"would be all downhill.\"<br />\nI was shocked a bit by his<br />\nbizarre reconciliation of Newton<br />\nto geography (then again, he hung<br />\nout with lacrosse players) but<br />\ndrove home even more surprised<br />\nat my own statements. I did not<br />\nsay that I was from Rhode Island<br />\nand went to school in Baltimore.<br />\nI said that I was from Baltimore<br />\nand worked in Rhode Island. A<br />\nsmall but significant difference.<br />\nBy the middle of August, the<br />\nsummer seemed interminable.<br />\nSeptember was a carrot on a<br />\nstick. I wanted to leave the Biggest Little State in the Union, get<br />\ninto my car and make the 400<br />\nmile trip \"down\" 95 to<br />\nBaltimore. Back to the Harbor, to<br />\nLexington Market. To dinner at<br />\nHausner's and foreign flicks at<br />\nthe Charles. To caffeine-induced<br />\nalertness and blurry nights at the<br />\nHut.

I figured, hey, what the<br />\nheck, ARA is out, Seiler's is in,<br />\nand they can't be that bad. So I<br />\nwent for the bold stroke and<br />\ndecided to go back to the Terrace<br />\nRoom for this, my final semester,<br />\nbut sadly have found the food<br />\npretty much the same as when I<br />\nleft it.<br />\nThis brings me to the point I've<br />\nbeen leading up to. Here I am,<br />\nback on the meal plan, and I<br />\nrealize that those at Seiler's have<br />\nmuch to learn about passive<br />\nlighting. As they must surely<br />\nnote, stores such as clothing and<br />\nwindow-shade stores are always<br />\nwell-lit, so the customer can easily see exactly what he or she is<br />\nbuying. On the other hand,<br />\nrestaurants, especially ones with<br />\nunpronouncable names, are<br />\nalmost universally dimly lit, for<br />\nit is difficult to spot that elusive<br />\nhair in your Lo Mein if you're<br />\nunable to see. Therefore it is clear<br />\nthat the Terrace Room is far too<br />\nwell lit, for nobody eating there<br />\nreally wants to see what they are<br />\neating. So may I therefore suggest<br />\nthat Seiler's dim the rheostat, and<br />\nperhaps maybe even nature will<br />\ntake its usual course in a newatmosphere<br />\nof<br />\nfound<br /><br />\nby Bruce A.

Darkness is bad for you; it<br />\nis dangerous to your health. So<br />\none would think that a key part<br />\nof a university education should<br />\nbe the promotion of a bunch of<br />\ndecent 100 watt bulbs so you can<br />\nlive a healthy, happy existence.<br />\nUnfortunately, as in many other<br />\nthings, The Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity does things, well, kind<br />\nof not the way they should be<br />\ndone. There are a number of<br />\nplaces on the campus where light<br />\nis not as well promoted as it<br />\nshould be; alas these are the Best<br />\nPlaces to Go Blind From Eye<br />\nStrain. The candidates for this<br />\ncoveted award are numerous.<br />\nBut first there are in contrast a<br />\nnumber of places where there<br />\nshould be less light, but instead<br />\nis too much. The obvious place<br />\n.that pops into mind is the Terrace<br />\nRoom.

The place is England in<br />\nthe 1890's, and Lane is one of<br />\nWilde's many stereotypes slow<br />\nbut definite to a point in which he<br />\nbecomes comical. To add to the<br />\nmelodramatic effect, Algernon<br />\nMoncrieff (Loren Fox), the<br />\nowner of the house, accompanies<br />\nLane with his not-all-that-perfect<br />\nof Tit-Willow.<br />\nrendition<br />\nAlthough nothing funny is said,<br />\nand nothing silly is done, the<br />\nopening is humorous, drawing a<br />\nfew hearty chuckles from the audience. The play follows in the<br />\nsame style of dry humor, creating<br />\na parody of British society, and<br />\nbeing funny without trying too<br />\nhard.<br />\nMoncrieff emerges from<br />\nbehind his piano to entertain sortof friend John Worthing (Sanjay<br />\nAggarwal).

The result was<br />\na bit of whimsy, a bit of slapstick<br />\nincognito, and an audience rolling with laughter.<br />\nWilde's satire was full of<br />\ncharacters who did their best at<br />\nbein sure of themselves as they<br /><br />\nsaid nothing. The seriousness of<br />\ntheir actions heightened the contrast with the play's absurdity, not<br />\ncausing immediate laughter, but<br />\nhidden laughter, after a moment's<br />\nthought: Wilde's sly humor is not<br />\nmeant for the slow witted. Robert<br />\nArellano's production of The Importance of Being Earnest successfully played off Wilde's contrast between seriousness and<br />\nhumor.<br /><br />\nSummer movie wrap-up<br />\nby Loren Fox and Frank Wu<br />\nA good many terrible films<br />\nhave come out this summer, but<br />\nthere have been some worthwhile<br />\nmovies that are still playing in the<br />\narea. Below are nine films many<br />\nstudents will consider seeing in<br />\ntheir brief respites from studying.<br />\nChoose carefully. For movie<br />\ntimes, call the theatres: Movies at<br />\nHarborpark, 837-3500; The<br />\nRotunda, 235-1800; Towson Art<br />\nCinema, 823-2436.<br />\nThe Big Easy is a romantic<br />\npolice story. Dennis Quaid is one<br />\nof the best New Orleans cops,<br />\nbelieving that he is one of the last<br />\ngood guys\u2014fighting the Mafia<br />\n(\"Wise guys\" in this town).<br />\nEllen Barkin, a district attorney's<br />\ninvestigator, thinks that the petty<br />\ncorruption of the police force has<br />\ngone too far. They puzzle over a<br />\ngang war, they fall in love.<br />\nQuaid, with his thick-tongued<br />\nrendition of an New Orleans accent, is far too cutesy for his own<br />\ngood, but he and Barkin have one<br />\nof the best romance scenes of recent movies. The Big Easy,<br />\nhowever, is too easy about relations between races, sexes, and<br />\npower and responsibility. This is<br />\na decent movie; it is also one that<br />\nwill lull the audience into accepting the contrived for the real.<br />\nRotunda. B-.<br />\nThe Fourth Protocol is an espionage thriller based on<br />\nFrederick Forsyth's book of that<br />\ntitle. It stars Michael Caine as a<br />\nBritish counter-intelligence agent<br />\nwith more humor than reserve,<br />\nand Pierce \"almost-James-Bond\"<br />\nBrosnan as a top Soviet agent<br />\nassigned to build and detonate an<br />\natomic bomb by a U.S. airbase.<br /><br />\nForsyth's plot has been streamlined, but because the movie uses<br />\nthe same fast pacing and short<br />\nepisodes, it may be difficult to<br />\nfollow. Caine shows that his omnipresence is not all bad; his<br />\ncharacter and those of the other<br />\nBritish agents are all fine.<br />\nBrosnan is adequate (his role is<br />\ntoo cool and flat). The other<br />\nSoviets are laughable: a KGB<br />\ngeneral Ned Beatty is not. Less<br />\nthan thrilling. Rotunda. B-.<br />\nThe Living Daylights is the new<br />\nJames Bond movie, starring the<br />\nnewest James Bond, Timothy<br />\nDalton. Dalton brings good<br />\ndramatic acting to the role, but<br />\nfails to convey the sense of fun<br />\nthat Connery or even Moore did.<br />\nThis James Bond is tense and.<br />\ntired. The plot is silly, as usual,<br />\ncentering on covert arms deals.<br />\nFor some reason a KGB general<br />\nmust be killed, but it's all very<br />\nmuddled. There are some neat<br />\nstunts, including a cello snow<br />\nchase (say that three times fast).<br />\nBond's love interest, Maryam<br />\nD'Abo, is sexy but lacks the<br />\nglamour of, say, Fawn Hall. The<br />\numpteenth outing of007 is disappointing, although the vehicle<br />\nwore thin ten years ago. For<br />\nBond fanatics only. Harbor. B-.<br />\nLa Bamba follows the rise and<br />\ndeath of Ritchie Valens, the 17<br />\nyear old rock star killed in the<br />\nsame plane crash as Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper(remember<br />\n\"American Pie\"?). This is not a<br />\nshowbiz story; this is a story<br />\nabout a Hispanic teenager who<br />\nlives the American Dream. Lou<br />\nDiamond Philips makes a good<br />\nValens, and Los Lobos sing the<br />\nsongs with gusto. Ritchie isn't<br />\nnearly as interesting as his \"bad\"<br />\nbrother, and the occasional des-<br /><br />\ncent into soap opera doesn't help.<br />\nBut this is a good, honest film.<br />\nand an adult film you can take the<br />\nkids to see. Director Luis Valdez<br />\nhandles the concert scenes well.<br />\nMarshall Crenshaw makes a<br />\nwonderful cameo as Buddy Holly. Towson. B+.<br />\nNo Way Out presents Kevin<br />\nCostner in his second major role<br />\nof the summer. He is a naval hero<br />\nwho gets transferred to the Pentagon. Gene Hackman is the<br />\nSecretary of Defense and Sean<br />\nYoung his mistress. Party girl<br />\nYoung falls for upwardly mobile<br />\nCostner. Hackman ckiesn't know<br />\nwho Young is seeing, but he is<br />\nvery jealous\u2014he \"accidentally\"<br />\nkills her. The cover-up begins.<br />\nHackman and his aide (Will Patton) decide the \"other man\" will<br />\nbe blamed. The catch is, they<br />\nassign that mission to that very<br />\nman, Costner. Costner is hardly<br />\nlackluster in this desperate role,<br />\nbut he has not shown versatility<br />\nin his work this summer.<br />\nHackman and Patton give better<br />\nperformances, as weak men given<br />\npower. The ending does not ruin<br />\nthe movie: it is the camp version<br />\nof elegant, geometrical storytelling. Rotunda. B +.<br />\nRobocop will fool you. Most<br />\npeople will think it's a typical<br />\nSchwarzenegger-Stallone kill the<br />\nworld flick. It's actually intelligent, well-handled science<br />\nfiction. Robocop is part of the<br />\nmovement called \"Cyberpunk\"<br />\nwhich, like Max Headroom,<br />\nbelieves that the near future will<br />\nbe a dismal landscape of urban<br />\ndecay and bureaucratic masturbation. Director Paul Verhoeven<br />\nhas made a comic-book on the big<br />\nscreen, and filled it with several<br />\nlevels of meaning and satire.<br /><br />\nSean Young and Kevin Costner in No Way Out.<br />\nPeter Weller (Buckaroo Banzai,,<br />\nplays the mechanized copper<br />\nwell, although he got the role<br />\nbecause as a long-distance runner, he was the only one who<br />\ncould act under 200 lbs. of<br />\nmakeup. Give the man a hand. If<br />\na little violence doesn't scare you<br />\noff, go see this cross between<br />\nRepo Man and A Boy and Has<br />\nDog. Bring your sense of irony.<br />\nHarbor. A-.<br />\nRoxanne is Steve Martin's clever<br />\nmodernization of the Cyrano<br />\nstory. Martin is the fire chief in<br />\na small western town with a really, really big schnozz. He falls<br />\nfor visiting astronomer Daryl<br />\nHannah. What follows is one of<br />\nthe brightest, crispest movies of<br />\nthe year. Forget that it pales in<br />\ncomparison to Rostand's brilliant<br />\nplay. There is no \"Thus as I end<br />\nthe refrain\" scene; instead, Steve<br />\nMartin beats up two guys with a<br />\ntennis racket. This is Steve Martin at his best, unusually intelligent, funny, athletic and<br />\nsharp. This is a film for people<br />\nwho promise not to compare it to<br />\nthe play. Towson. A-.<br />\nStakeout is an easy movie to like.<br />\nRichard Dreyfuss and Emilio<br />\nEstevez are Seattle cops watching<br />\nthe ex-girlfriend of a recently<br />\nescaped convict; Dreyfuss falls<br />\nfor the woman (Madeleine Stowe)<br />\nand life becomes hectic for all in-<br /><br />\nvolved. Dreyfuss confirms his<br />\nreturn from oblivion and Estevez<br />\nshows he is an adult at last. Stowe<br />\nis sweet in her role, in a summer<br />\nbearing too few strong women's<br />\nroles. There is no excuse for the<br />\nrelish with which director John<br />\nBadham (Blue Thunder)turns out<br />\nthe typical car chase and dream<br />\nsequence. Although the movie is<br />\njuvenile, with no pretensions, it<br />\nis also enjoyable. Harbor. B.<br />\nThe Untouchables confirms<br />\nwhat we've long suspected: Brian<br />\nDe Palma is an excellent stylist<br />\nwho longs desperately to be an<br />\nauteur but unfortunately has<br />\nnothing to say. In this confrontation between Al Capone (Robert<br />\nDeNiro) and Elliot Ness (Kevin<br />\nCostner), De Palma avoids Hitchcock and steals instead from<br />\nEisenstein and Woody Allen.<br />\nCostner has been touted as<br />\nHollywood's new leading man,<br />\nbut judging from his Ness.<br />\nHollywood must be looking for a<br />\nbland mix of Mark Harmon and<br />\nTom Cruise. DeNiro plays<br />\nCapone as an opera character.<br />\nand we never get to see him alone<br />\nor personal. Actually, it's the best<br />\nlooking movie of the summer,<br />\nalthough there was no reason to<br />\nmake it. Sean Connery steals the<br />\nshow as a walking cliche. Harbor.

One vendor<br />\nspecializes in Australian goods:<br />\ncandy, clothing and stuffed<br />\nkangaroos. As on the first level<br />\nthere are a great variety of<br />\nspecialty foods, and some notables<br />\ninclude Swenson ice cream,<br />\nFudgery fudge, Pennsylvania<br />\nfried dough.

Its major attractions are<br />\nsituated right beside the<br />\nChesapeake Bay.<br />\nThe Light Street and Pratt<br />\nStreet Pavilions make up Harborplace, a collection of 140<br />\nspecialty shops and restaurants.<br />\nFor general shopping, one can<br />\nbrowse through the Pratt Street<br />\nPavilion; it contains stores selling<br />\nclothing, shoes, fine china, and<br />\nimpressive selections of unusual<br />\ncards, stuffed animals, music<br />\nboxes and games. Several famous<br />\nrestaurants specializing in Indian<br />\n(Tandoor), Grecian (Taverna<br />\nAthena) and seafood (Mariner's<br />\nPier One) dishes are located inside the two-level building. One<br />\ncan dine while looking at the Inner Harbor Marina in the Bamboo House. This Chinese<br />\nrestaurant serves Mandarin and<br />\nSzechuan.cuisine in a \"bamboo\"<br />\ntheme setting.<br />\nWhile the Light Street Pavilion<br />\nalso offers several restaurants, its<br />\ngreatest attraction is a wide variety of food stands. On the ground<br />\nlevel, one can buy exotic<br />\ncookbooks, multi-flavored jelly<br />\nbeans, honey-laden baked goods,<br />\nand lollipops which come in ice<br />\ncream flavors like chocolate mint.<br />\nThe jelly bean store also sells the<br />\nultimate in chocolate games: a<br />\ncomplete multi-colored Monopoly board, bank money included,<br />\nwhich sells for only $500.<br />\nOn the second level of the<br />\npavilion, there are a variety of<br />\nshops and more food vendors.<br />\nFor people who adore penguins<br />\nor love the Orioles, each bird has<br />\nits own stand filled with items<br /><br />\nRichard Bell<br /><br />\nby Kim Juvan<br /><br />\nHarborplace, home to the U.S.S.

Clothing and shoe stores<br />\nare most prevalent, though<br />\nunusual merchandise can be<br />\nfound in several specialty shops.<br />\n\"The Sharper Image,\" for example, sells a Japanese massage<br />\nboard, hologram and titanium<br />\nwatches, as well as high-quality<br />\nlenswear (cameras, binoculars,<br />\netc.) A very new style clothing<br />\nstore, \"Units System,\" supplies<br />\nclothing based on a basic blockshape, all knits which can be fitted together to make a wardrobe.<br />\nA walk-way from the third floor<br />\nof the four-story mall connects it<br />\nto the Pratt Street Pavilion to<br />\navoid traffic-crossing problems.<br />\nFor anyone interested in more<br />\nfood and seeing a different<br />\nperspective of Baltimore, Lexington Market is a ten-minute<br />\nwalk northwest of the harbor<br />\narea. Again, there are many<br />\nspecialty food stands including<br />\nfresh produce, and the short hike<br />\ntakes you past department stores,<br />\noffice buildings and more<br />\n\"local\" entertainment areas. The<br />\nLexington Mall shops are geared<br />\nmore for neighborhood shoppers<br />\nthan tourists.<br />\nIn planning a trip to the Inner<br />\nHarbor area, it should be noted<br />\nthat both pavilions and nearby<br />\nConvention Center mall contain<br />\n\"Easy-Bank\" or \"Most\"<br />\nmachines. You can take the<br />\nnumber 3 and number 61 buses<br />\ndown St. Paul Street to within<br />\nseveral blocks of the harbor. In<br />\nfact, the 3 bus passes Lexington<br />\nMall at Saratoga and Froward<br />\nStreets.

Mount<br />\nVernon is the stretch of unique<br />\nrestaurants and odd shops near<br />\nthe Washington Monument on the<br />\n800 block of North Charles. Here<br />\nis a sampling:<br />\nTony Cheng's Szechuan<br />\n(801 N. Charles St., 539-6666):<br />\nFor the best Chinese food in<br />\nBaltimore, stop by Tony<br />\nCheng's. They serve superb<br />\nSzechuan cuisine and some Mandarin dishes. Dinner will cost<br />\nabout $20 a head for a full meal,<br />\nbut be prepared to pay even more<br />\nfor specialty dishes. Weekday<br />\nlunches are significantly cheaper.<br />\nLouie's Bookstore Cafe<br />\n(518 N. Charles St., 962-1224):<br />\nLouie's appeals to the artist in<br />\nall of us. The cafe itself is<br />\ndecorated with paintings from<br />\nlocal artists (all for sale), and live<br /><br />\nThe Red Sea<br />\n(around the corner from Tony<br />\nCheng's, 547-8178): The Red<br />\nSea is the only Ethiopian<br />\nrestaurant in Baltimore. Ethiopian<br />\ncuisine is similar to Indian food<br />\nin flavor, but it is not nearly as<br />\nstrong\u2014better suited to American<br />\npalates. Another novelty is that<br />\nyou eat it with your hands. If this<br />\nrepulses you, it is a shame,<br />\nbecause the food is quite good.<br />\nThe staff is very helpful for Ecuisine virgins. They can even<br />\nrecommend entrees for you if you<br />\nfind yourself lost in the<br />\ntransliterations. An entree and a<br />\nglass of Tej (honey wine) costs<br />\nbetween $15 and $20 per person<br />\nand less without the wine.<br />\nTransportation to Mount Vernon is easy by the Med School<br />\nShuttle (see schedule elsewhere in<br />\nthis article), and it's free! Just get<br />\noff at the Peabody Conservatory<br />\nstop and walk up the hill to<br />\nCharles Street. You can also take<br />\na city bus downtown. Most buses<br />\ngo down Cathedral Street. Get off<br />\naround the 800 block and walk<br />\ndown a block to Charles Street.<br /><br />\nThe Washington Monument was the center of Baltimore's<br />\nhigh life in the 19th century.<br /><br />\nThe Peabody Conservatory<br /><br />\nRichard Bell<br /><br />\nA9,<br /><br />\n11111111116<br /><br />\nThe Baltimore neighborhood of Mt.

Lunch offers cafe items<br />\nsuch as salads and sandwiches<br />\nwith a twist. Louie's is also<br />\nrumored to have the best coffee<br />\nin Baltimore. The dinner menu<br />\nprovides an interesting combination of entrees like tenthouse<br />\nchicken (chicken breasts with<br />\noyster stuffing) or pasta<br />\nprimavera (fettucine and fresh<br />\nvegetables in a cream sauce). A<br />\nfull dinner with appetizer and<br />\nsalad will cost around $20 per<br />\nperson including tip.<br />\nGampy 's<br />\n(904 N. Charles, 837-9797):<br />\nGampy's, or The Great<br />\nAmerican Melting Pot, is all its<br />\nname entails. The menu is exceptionally diverse. You can order<br />\nall types of food from hot dogs to<br />\nBeef Wellington. And the food is<br />\nconsistently excellent. Because<br />\nthe customer is not limited to buying an entree, prices vary, but<br />\nthey are not exorbitant. Gampy's<br />\ndoes not take reservations after<br />\n6:30 so be sure to call early on<br />\nweekend nights.<br /><br />\nThe Peabody Conservatory,<br />\nlocated in the Mount Vernon<br />\narea, is one of the few bastions<br />\nof humanities in the fields of<br />\nscience one normally associates<br />\nwith Hopkins. Artistically inclined -(and talented) students may<br />\ntake courses at Peabody. such as<br />\ninstrumental or voice lessons, or<br />\nmusic theory or recording techniques. Hopkins students may also<br />\nparticipate in Peabody ensembles<br />\n(orchestra, chorus, chamber<br />\nmusic, opera. and wind<br />\nensemble).<br />\nPeabody also has a wide variety of cultural offerings for the<br />\ncommunity, such as concerts,<br />\noperas and recitals, and an excellent music library. A Hopkins<br />\nID is all you need to check out<br />\nmusic, use the practice rooms, or<br />\nreceive discounts on events (as<br />\nlong as you purchase your aiscount ticket in advance). The<br />\nMedical School Shuttle stops here<br />\non its route, providing easy (and<br />\nfree) access to Peabody and the<br />\n,rest of Mount Vernon.<br /><br />\nThe Peabody Conservatory, an internationally renowned school of music, now part of the Johns Hopkins University. It's<br />\na nice place to spend a rainy Saturday (listening to pretty music).<br /><br />\nPAGE 10-SEPTEMBER 18, 1987<br /><br />\nShopping in style. . .Owings Mills<br />\nby D. Zeiger<br />\nOMM . . . No, It's not some exotic transcendental meditation<br />\nchant, it's short for Owings Mills<br />\nMall, also known as Owings<br />\nMills Town Center (at least it is<br />\non the exit sign from Route 795).<br />\nOwings Mills Mall is one of the<br />\nnewest shopping malls\u2014opening<br />\nthe summer of 1986\u2014in the area,<br />\nand also one of the best. And now<br />\nthat the Metro has opened up a<br />\nstop in Owings Mills, the mall is<br />\none of the most accessible to<br />\nHopkins students who have<br />\noutgrown (or outshopped) the<br />\nRotunda.<br />\nAs a piece of architecture, Owings Mills Mall is rather attractive, both inside and out. The<br />\nthree department stores (Hecht's,<br />\nMacy's, and Saks) are constructed in contrasting shades of<br />\nbrick, so the mall appears quite<br />\ndistinctive as you approach from<br />\nthe highway. The interior of the<br />\nmall is brass, glass, and marble,<br />\nwith escalators and big marble<br />\nstaircases connecting the two<br />\nlevels of shops.<br />\nSpeaking of shops, yes, Owings Mills does have the usual<br />\nassortment of \"mall shops\".<br />\nThere's a Gap, a Limited and an<br />\nExpress, and Esprit shop, and a<br />\nBenetton. However, Owings<br />\nMills does have many stores that<br />\naren't quite as common in the<br /><br />\nBaltimore area\u2014and possibly<br />\nmany others, including clothing<br />\nand novelty stores, and places to<br />\neat.<br />\nFirst, there's the Banana<br />\nRepublic (one of two in the area),<br />\nwhich is notable not so much for<br />\nthe safari and military-style<br />\nclothes inside, as it is for the truly original window display outside. This features a jeep crashing<br />\nthrough the front window of the<br />\nshop, with grass and rocks at the<br />\nbase.<br />\nFor those into \"trendier\" type<br />\nfashions, there's Cignal on the<br />\nlower level and Le Chateau on the<br />\nupper. Cignal is the more expensive of the two, but they tend to<br />\ncarry name designers and are a bit<br />\nmore high-fashion. They also<br />\nhave some really neat accesories<br />\nand jewelry. Le Chateau, on the<br />\nother hand, carries the sort of<br />\nclothes one is likely to see on<br />\nyoung Europeans\u2014classy but not<br />\noutrageously expensive.<br />\nThis reporter doesn't claim to<br />\nbe a great expert on men's<br />\nfashions, but from most appearances, there seem to be nice<br />\nthings to be had in Webster and<br />\nthe Cedar Post, as well as the<br />\naforementioned Banana Republic<br />\nand the Gap. You might also want<br />\nto check out the department<br />\nstores\u2014they might surprise you.<br />\nWhile we're on the subject of<br />\nthe department stores\u2014a brief<br /><br />\nword about them should be said.<br />\nThe branches of Macy's and<br />\nHecht's at Owings Mills are probably the best in the Baltimore<br />\narea and Saks is the only Saks in<br />\nthe Baltimore area. Occasionally they have pretty good sales, so<br />\nthey're worth checking out.<br />\nIf you're into gadgets and<br />\nnovelties, there are good places<br />\nfor them as well. Brookstone on<br />\nthe upper level has gadgets aplenty; from traveling items to<br />\ncalculators to radios to games to 3<br />\ngeneral curiosities. It's a place sE)<br />\nthat you walk through and c\u00b03<br />\nwonder either \"Why didn't someone think of this sooner?\" or<br />\n\"What will they think of next?\"<br />\nDallas Alice, which is also on the<br />\nupper level, but near the Conservatory (the food hall), is a great<br />\nplace for neat T-shirts, cards, and<br />\nother novelties. They also have<br />\nsome unusual jewelry in their<br />\njewelry case, but it's the T-shirts<br />\nthat are probably the most fun, interesting item inside.<br />\nWell, now that you've done all<br />\nthis shopping, you're probably<br />\npretty hungry. Have no fear,<br />\nthere's something at Owings<br />\nMills to satisfy just about any<br />\npalate. Besides the Conservatory,<br />\nwhich is where most of the<br />\neateries are situated, there are<br />\nalso a few other places scattered<br />\nthroughout the mall. The Conservatory has many small places<br /><br />\nwhere you can order and pick up deed be called \"trendy\")food.<br />\nThere are many more things to<br />\nfast food\u2014there are burger<br />\nplaces, a deli, a bagel place, a see and to buy in Owings Mills,<br />\nyogurt place, and counters that which time and space do not perspecialize in Chinese food, mit me to cover, for instance, the<br />\nPhilippine cooking, and turkey two bookstores\u2014which carry a<br />\ndishes. There's also a cafeteria pretty large stock of imported<br />\nand a sit-down restaurant, Ruby magazines between them; the two<br />\nTuesday, that has everything record shops; and the numerous<br />\nfrom Cajun to Teriyaki. The sur- clothing, shoe, and food stores<br />\nroundings in the Conservatory are not mentioned. Owings Mills is<br />\nalso very pleasant\u2014a big a mall definitely worth visiting,<br />\nskylight, fountains, and real and now that a lot of stores in the<br />\ntopiary and greenery. As for the mall are open on Sunday, it's<br />\nrest of the mall, there's an ice even more convenient.

Usually.<br />\nWhen I lived in Building A two<br />\nyears ago, I noticed that my<br />\nroommate and I were the same<br />\nheight, as were my two<br />\nsuitemates. I discovered later that<br />\nin my dorm, nearly all pairs of<br />\nroommates had approximately the<br />\nsame height.<br />\nDormitory Assistant Trish<br />\nCovell offered an explanation.<br />\n\"The only thing I've ever heard<br />\nabout this is that there is a level<br />\nof comfort in similarity,\" she<br />\nsaid. \"Therefore, a short person<br />\nmay feel uncomfortable with a<br />\ntall person.\"<br />\nShe said that most freshmen are<br />\nassigned roommates by computer. \"They're assigned to a<br />\nbuilding of their choice, if possi-<br /><br />\nRichard Bell<br /><br />\nby Jon Stempel<br /><br />\nble, and then all questionnaires go<br />\ndown to the computer center,\"<br />\nshe said. \"We have computer<br />\nmatch-up software.\"<br />\nThe Housing Office collects<br />\ndata for the computer from questionnaires distributed during the<br />\nsummer that ask freshmen questions about their living style and<br />\nstudy habits\u2014and height.<br />\nOf the questions, said Covell,<br />\nthe question on smoking habits<br /><br />\ncarries the greatest weight. She<br />\nsaid that the questions about \"the<br />\ntime you go to bed and the study<br />\nenvironment are weighted fairly<br />\nheavily,\" and \"everything else is<br />\nweighted about the same.\"<br />\nOnce housed, freshmen will<br />\ndiscover the many different ways<br />\nto arrange their furniture.<br />\nThe University, said Covell,<br />\npurchased the furniture because<br />\nof its durability and its versatility. On the latter, Covell explained, \"When you're dealing.with a<br />\ndouble room which has a limited<br />\namount of space, there's a greater<br />\nneed for compact furniture.<br />\nWe're looking for the most personal space possible.\"<br />\nBecause the furniture' is<br />\nmodular, dormitory residents can<br />\narrange their furniture in many<br />\nways without leaving gaps between any two pieces, and can use<br />\nthe bolts provided with the furniture when necessary.<br />\nCovell advised that students<br />\n= \"shouldn't attempt an unusual arrangement [of the furniture]<br />\n\u25aa without having maintenance<br />\n.5<br />\n- check it to make sure it isn't<br />\ncc dangerous.\"<br /><br />\n\"Our Council is definitely<br />\nstudent-service oriented .<br />\nthink last year's Student Council<br />\nwas more of a forum for political<br />\ndebate. -I'd like to get away from<br />\nthat; that is not what we are here<br />\nfor,\" vowed Student Council<br />\nPresident Scott FitzGerald in an<br />\ninterview with the Nevi's- Letter<br />\nlast week.<br />\nIn addition to the particular<br />\nphilosophy he hoped would<br />\ncharacterize his tenure, FitzGerald discussed various areas in<br />\nwhich the Council aspires to initiate change this year, including<br />\nhousing, student services and<br />\nsocial events.<br />\nFitzGerald hopes the Council's<br />\nagenda will develop in keeping<br />\nwith its official purpose, that is,<br />\n\"to improve undergraduate life<br />\nand act as a bridge between<br />\nstudents and the University<br />\nadministration.\"<br />\n\"I feel one of my primary<br />\nduties is to do things on a one-toone level. . .to have students.<br />\ncome to me and say 'Fitz\u2014we<br />\nhave a problem, what can you<br />\ndo?'

FitzGerald - feels the<br />\nCouncil need: to diversify its<br />\nsocial offerings in order to attract<br />\ngreater attendance. The proposed closure of the \"Rat\" points to<br />\na need for such diversification.<br />\n\"The only things that would<br />\ndraw more attention to the Rat are<br />\nbetter entertainment and better<br />\nadvertisement but if people still<br />\ndon't want to go, you can't<br />\nchange that. . . we can work on<br />\nother things\u2014like Comedy<br />\nClubs,\" commented FitzGerald.<br />\n\"People don't want to have.<br />\ndances that are just dances,\" he<br />\ncontinued. \"People want more\u2014<br />\nthe Air Band Dance last semester<br />\nwent over really well.

Sadly for those<br />\nstudents addicted to the notion of<br />\nimbibing freely throughout college, such is not to be at Hopkins.<br />\nSince the State of Maryland raised its drinking age from 18 to 21<br />\nin 1982, the campus (at Johns<br />\nHopkins) has been, for all intensive purposes, \"dry\". Simply<br />\nput, Maryland law prohibits the<br /><br />\npossession or consumption of<br />\nalcoholic beverages by persons<br />\nunder the age of 21\u2014a law which<br />\nobviously affects a majority of<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe ramifications of such a law<br />\nextend into all areas of campus<br />\nlife\u2014certainly there are restrictions on social events by the HOP<br />\n(Hopkins Office of Programs)<br />\nand other campus groups. But<br />\nperhaps the law poses the most<br />\nunique difficulties for students sequesteced in the dormitories, who.<br />\nmay feel constrained by the arms<br />\nof both Maryland law and<br />\nadministrators<br />\nUniversity<br />\nreaching into their private living<br />\nareas. Is there any justice?<br />\nUnfortunately, the law is the<br />\nlaw and not even Hopkins<br />\nstudents are above. The University rok in enforcing that law is<br /><br />\nfairly clear-. According to Andrea<br />\nPerry, Director of Residential<br />\nLife, \"The University has an<br />\nobligation to have its residents<br />\nunderstand the law. . .they are<br />\nresponsible for their own<br />\nbehavior. Further, we have a<br />\nresponsibility to police\u2014<br />\nconsumption and possession in<br />\npublic\u2014we will confiscate such<br />\nalcohol.\"<br />\nHowever, Perry continued,<br />\n\"we feel students have a right to<br />\nprivacy. It isn't our sense that we<br />\nought to invade on private<br />\nareas. . .but if we have a sense<br />\nthat a student is abusive. . .we<br />\nwill intervene.\" The persons<br />\nspecifically authorized to intervene are the housemasters and<br />\nstaff members of Residential<br />\nLife.<br />\nThe actions taken if illegal<br /><br />\nN\u2014L<br />\nWe do more between midnight<br />\nand 3 a.m. than most people do<br />\nall day.<br />\nIf you talk to an editor at work<br />\nin the News-Letter production at<br />\n2 a.m. on any given day, he or<br />\nshe will leave you no doubt as to<br />\nthe truth of the statement.<br />\nOne of the oldest Hopkins institutions (after Dr. Gryder, of<br />\ncourse), the News-Letter began,<br />\nin 1897, as a bi-weekly journal<br />\nprinted on book-quality paper,<br />\nwith an unheard of price of ten<br />\ncents. As with any organization<br />\nof such advanced years, the<br />\nNews-Letter has undergone<br />\nnumerous changes in style and<br />\npurpose.<br />\nNow a free weekly paper with<br />\na circulation of 6,000, the NewsLetter is arguably the most influential student organization on<br />\ncampus (at least we would argue<br />\nit), providing news of campus interest, features on student life,<br />\nand information on everything<br />\nelse, both in and out of Baltimore.<br />\nWe even have a comic strip that<br /><br />\nsubstances are discovered are<br />\nhighly dependent on the circumstances explained Perry. The<br />\npenalties would range from community service to social probation<br />\nto recommendations for therapy<br />\nto severe disciplinary actions such<br />\nas expulsion, and are enacted<br />\nunder the authority of the Office<br />\nof the Dean of Students.<br />\nOn the whole, the drinking age<br />\ntransition over the past six years<br />\nhas been fairly smooth. \"There<br />\nhas been less abusive behavior<br />\nconnected to drinking than there<br />\nused to be\u2014less vandalism, altercations, injuries, hospitalization,\" notes Perry, \"but students<br />\nare forced to drink in private ...it<br />\nis unfortunate that they have lost<br />\nthe ability to drink positively in<br />\na social setting.\"<br />\nHousemasters attest to the<br /><br />\nsmooth transition, despite the unpopular role of \"confiscator\"<br />\nthey are traditionally thrust into.<br />\nAdams Housemaster Molly Bardsley feels that the freshmen have<br />\nabout<br />\ngood<br />\nquite<br />\nbeen<br />\ncooperating with University<br />\npolicies. \"The freshmen tend to<br />\nbe very reasonable with regard to<br />\nrespecting the authority of the<br />\nhousemasters. They understand<br />\nthat it's what we have to be.\"<br />\nFinally, while recognizing the<br />\ndifficulties of reconciling collegiate drinking expectations with<br />\nlaw and reality, Perry offers a<br />\nword of advice. \"Drinking is not<br />\nan essential ingredient for a good<br />\ntime...If you think it is, you are<br />\ndetermined to drink. . . be aware<br />\nyou are doing,so as an adult and<br />\nhave adult resonsibilities for your<br />\nactions.\"<br /><br />\nWhere to turn<br />\nEach year, many freshmen find<br />\nthemselves overwhelmed by the<br />\nsocial, personal, and acadmeic<br />\npressures of'surviving' their first<br />\nyear of college. The following is<br />\na partial list of services to help<br />\nyou make it through your first<br />\nyear (and they're there for you<br />\neven after you become a<br />\nsophomore):<br /><br />\nThe Gatehouse, home to the World Famous Hopkins News-Letter.<br />\nlooks like \"Doonesbury\".<br />\nAveraging thirty pages a week,<br />\nthe News-Letter has featured articles ranging from interviews<br />\nwith international television<br />\ncelebrities to reviews of books by<br />\nHopkins professors.<br />\nUnlike most(ahem)prestigious<br />\nstudent publications, students do<br />\nnot have to be journalism majors<br />\nto write, or even edit.

The book<br />\nwas hailed as a landmark for a<br />\nwasteland, and the author, twenty at the time, a senior at Bennington College, was celebrated as<br />\nthe voice of his generation. Time<br />\nmagazine noted this summer that<br />\nEllis and fellow hipster Jay<br />\nMcInerney had become pals, as<br />\nif that relationship would influence the course of contemporary literature. While there is<br />\nthe dangerous proverbial kernel<br />\nof truth to the hackneyed phrases<br />\nof praises, fame has obscured the<br />\ngenuine strengths of Ellis'<br />\nwriting.<br />\nLess Than Zero is an impressive debut. The novel traces<br />\nthe return of rich kid Clay to Los<br />\nAngeles from an East coast college. Home for the holidays, Clay<br />\nfinds that people are still up to,<br />\n\"Oh, like the usual. Going to<br />\nNautilus, getting smashed, going<br />\nto this Uva place [a tanning salon]<br />\n\" Doing drugs, forgetting<br />\nwith whom they have slept, seeing analysts and going shopping:<br />\nin this novel, money buys such<br />\npleasures for Clay and his peers.<br />\nWhat there is of a story concerns Clay and Blair, an exgirlfriend. As the novel opens,<br />\nshe picks him up from the airport<br />\nand declares, \"people are afraid<br />\nto merge on freeways in Los<br /><br />\nAngeles.\" As the novel takes the<br />\nreader through an utterly burntout reality, this statement<br />\npresumably takes on much<br />\ngreater significance.<br />\nThe major episodes of Clay's<br />\nvacation involve some friends<br />\nwho have been keeping a twelve<br />\nyear-old girl for their amusement;<br />\nhomosexual prostitution; and finding a dead body. Clay is cool,<br />\nhardly caring about any of this,<br />\nbut on a visit to his psychiatrist,<br />\n\"coming off from coke, sneezing<br />\nblood,\" the doctor asks him<br />\nabout Elvis Costello and he asks<br />\nback,\"'what about me?'\"<br />\n\"'What about you?\"<br />\n\"What about me?\"<br />\n\u2014 You'll be fine.\"<br />\n\"I don't know,' I say. 'I don't<br />\nthink so.\"<br />\n\u2014 Let's talk about something<br />\nelse.\"<br />\n\"What about me?' I scream,<br />\nchoking.\"<br />\n\"Come on, Clay. . . Don't be<br />\nso mundane.\"<br />\nLater Clay, disinterested more<br />\nthan anything else, asks his friend<br />\nwho has the captive twelve yearold, \u2014Oh shit . . . what don't you<br />\nhave?\"<br />\ndon't have anything to<br />\nlose.\"<br />\nAnd the reader has little to lose<br />\nor gain from this sordid story.<br />\nAlthough Ellis does display a<br />\nmastery of his chosen venue, his<br />\ntone is neutral and so ends up exalting in the situation it presents,<br />\nrather than offering any comment. There is certainly not<br />\nenough humanity for the upcoming movie version to present Clay<br />\nas somewhat of a moral fellow<br />\ntrying to rescue his friends from<br />\ntheir own angst, as has been<br />\nreported. That would require an<br />\nincredible talent for revision, or<br />\ngreat tolerance for the Clay's<br />\nbrand of sickly melancholy,<br />\nwhich he believes to be strong,<br />\nmature emotion. The bands,<br />\nclothes, MTV and videogames<br /><br />\nare out already and the story is<br />\ndated, so what is offered by Less<br />\nThan Zero? One of the best<br />\ndocuments of the era. Stripped of<br />\nthe hype, taken as a first novel instead of a masterpiece, set into<br />\nperspective, yes, the work has a<br />\ncertain on-the-edge quality as a<br />\nreport on our own frightening<br />\nculture and as a demonstration of<br />\ntaut writing rather than as serious<br />\nliterature.<br />\nFrom the slight historical vantage that is now available, the<br />\nquestion that the novel presents is<br />\nwhether or not Ellis can carry his<br />\nwork by slick writing alone. After<br />\nall, hipster doomsday sentimentality wears well only for those<br />\nwho die young.<br />\nUnfortunately, with his second<br />\nbook, Rules of Attraction, Ellis<br />\nshows that he prefers working in<br />\na disPollyanna vacuum. The new<br />\nnovel is one of the worst works<br />\nof fiction ever published.<br />\nIt tells of a group of apathetic<br />\nstudents at Camden, the small<br />\nliberal arts college in New<br />\nEngland, Less Than Zero Clay's<br />\nschool. Clay doesn't appear until late in the book, but among his<br />\npeers, there is Lauren, who can't<br />\nget over her ex-boyfriend Victor,<br />\nand who is distinguished (barely)<br />\nby her changing majors all of the<br />\ntime. The dustjacket praises Paul<br />\nas a bisexual \"whose passion<br />\nmasks a shrewd pragmatism,\" as<br />\nis demonstrated by his reaction to<br />\na someone bursting into his room<br />\nbefore a big date with news of a<br />\nsuicide attempt: \"He looked like<br />\nhe was going to cry and he gave<br />\nthis event (a Freshman suicide?<br />\noh, please) a dimension of unwarranted emotion.\" Sean, with<br />\nwhom Paul sleeps, because he<br />\nowns a motorcycle, is the central<br />\ncharacater. His attitude sums up<br />\nthe novel: \"Yeah. I'm going to<br />\nthe party tonight. You going .0<br />\nthe<br />\ntonight?\"'.<br />\nparty<br />\nMeaningless.<br />\nEllis uses a format of short<br /><br />\nAfter discovering success with his first novel, Less Than Zero, Bret Easton<br />\nEllis continues his streak in The Rules ofAttraction.<br />\nepisodes, switching points of<br />\nview to no great effect, making<br />\nit only more difficult to iort out<br />\nthe empty affairs and petty concerns of each character. The<br />\nchore is hardly worth the effort,<br />\nespecially since Ellis repeats<br />\nscenes with the same may-aswell-be-dead tone.<br />\nWere the novel to be redeemed by anything, it would be witticisms, trademark minimalist<br />\nsarcasm. The trouble is that, in<br />\nthis novel, what are intende,i as<br />\npointed observations are talc tall<br />\ntoo seriously by the characters<br />\nand the author, as they wonder<br />\nwho the secret admirer is and<br />\nwhat will happen at The Dressed<br />\nTo Get Screwed party (there is no<br />\nfurther plot). Clay, for example,<br />\nrecasts his opening line from the<br />\nlast novel, concluding that people<br />\nare afraid to merge on campus.<br />\nVictor: \"I didn't know where I<br />\nwas. Everything was full of<br />\ntourists. So I went to this nude<br />\nbeach. Hung out, got naked, ate<br />\nyogurt and swam with these two<br />\nYugoslavian guys who complained about inflation and wanted to<br />\nmake me a Socialist.\"<br />\nSean: \"Like all rich hippies. . . she spent a lot of time<br />\nfollowing The Dead around.<br />\nShe'd simply split school for a<br />\nweek with other rich hippies and<br />\nthey'd follow them around New<br />\nEngland, stoned out of their<br />\nminds, reserving rooms and<br />\nsuites at Holiday Inns and<br />\nHoward Johnsons and Ramada<br />\nInns, making sure to always have<br />\nenough Blue Dragon or MDA or<br />\nMDMA or Ecstasy. She'd come<br />\nback from these excursions<br />\necstatic, claiming that. . .she was<br />\ntruly one of 'Jerry's kids.' I guess<br />\nshe was one of Jerry's kids,<br />\nthough I wasn't sure which<br />\nkind.\"<br />\nThe Secret Admirer: \"Mouthbreathing waitresses came on to<br />\nYou, You, who were bronzed<br />\nlike a God, a GQ man, Your hair<br />\nslicked back.\"<br />\nLauren: \"What else is one .to<br />\ndo at college except drink beer or<br /><br />\nslash your wrists?\"<br />\nEllis has re-found the lost<br />\ngeneration, but fails to notice that<br />\nthey have lost themselves. It<br />\nrepresents no particular moral<br />\nstand to criticize this, for the<br />\ncharacters are amoral, without<br />\neven an articulate amorality. So<br />\nengrossed in fast living are the<br />\ncollege students that inhabit<br />\nEllisland, they would be unlikely to read even Less Than Zero,<br />\nor Rules of Attraction. Yuppies<br />\nat least work. The Ellis children<br />\nlead lives that are a blur; their<br />\nstory is worthless. The style does<br />\nnot even hold the seamless quality that was so admired in the first<br />\nnovel.<br />\nThe greater crime here is not<br />\nthat Ellis espouses some sort of<br />\nheinous lifestyle (which he does,<br />\nby most standards), but that he<br />\ndoes a lousy job of telling a story.<br />\nHis characters don't care. Why<br />\nshould the reader?<br />\nEllis perhaps realizes what he<br />\nis doing: Sean and Lauren attend<br />\na party at her poetry teacher's<br />\nhouse, where they meet Stump<br />\n(\"Used to be Carcass but changed it\"), and have an interesting<br />\ndiscussion on writing. Stump is a<br />\npoet who has learned his art from<br />\nBlack Flag and he is writing a<br />\nseries about bestiality. \"I'm<br />\nworking on the dog section now<br />\nwhere this guy ties a dog up and<br />\nis having intercourse with it<br />\nbecause He thinks dog is God. D.G-0-D. God spelled<br />\nO-G<br />\nbackwards. Get it? See?\"<br />\nAnother artist asks whether this<br />\n\"post-Vietman, post-Watergate,<br />\npost- . . . hell, post-everything\"<br />\nwriting is worthwhile, or just<br />\n\"bogus.\"<br />\nWere Ellis to apply his not inconsiderable stylistic skill to a<br />\nworthwhile story, he would begin<br />\nto live up to the gushing he has<br />\ninspired. Rules of Attraction,<br />\nhowever, is deserving of not even<br />\nfaint and fading praise.<br /><br />\n14/SEPTEMBER 18. 1987<br /><br />\nLEAVE A VOID<br />\nIN THE<br />\nNOID<br />\nClip ibis coupon off the<br />\nNOID's face and call<br />\nDomino's Pizza now!<br />\nWe Avoid The NOID<br />\nand make pizza just the<br />\nway you want it.<br />\n2724 Remington Ave<br />\nPhone 338-2500<br />\nOpen for lunch<br />\n11 am-1 am Sun-Thurs.<br />\n11 am-2 am Fri &amp; Sat<br />\nOur drivers carry less<br />\nthan $20.00<br />\nLimited delivery area.<br />\n1987 Dominos P,zza.

Even if<br />\nyou never burn, you may be<br />\nreceiving too much ultraviolet<br />\nradiation and so may suffer later<br />\nfrom some of the diseases<br />\nassociated with too much radiation, cancers being the most<br />\nserious.<br />\nThere is no. cause for alarm,<br />\nsun-seekers, but there is a list of<br />\nprecautions which dermatologists<br />\nand the Skin Cancer Foundation<br />\nrecommend following<br />\nto<br />\nminimize your risk (see box).<br />\nMost physicians agree that<br />\nreasonable adherence to these<br />\nseem-<br /><br />\nmeasures will ensure healthy skin<br />\nfor most of one's life and prevent<br />\nthe dreaded diseases and<br />\npremature wrinkling that have<br />\nbeen seen in increasing numbers.<br />\nMany outdoors types have<br />\noverlooked these safe and simple<br />\nrules, unfortunately, and dermatologists have seen the average<br />\nage of skin cancer nose dive from<br />\nthe 60's to the 30's. President<br />\nReagan is an example of a<br />\nSouthern Californian with skin<br />\ncancer problems, but many doctors have claimed that some<br />\nCalifornians have had to deal with<br />\nthe skin-salvaging procedures<br />\nsuch as surgery at half the President's age.<br />\nThere is another controversy in<br />\nthe tanning picture these days,<br />\nand it revolves around the popular<br />\nuse of tanning salons. Nationally<br />\npopular, and doing quite well in<br />\nthe Baltimore area as well, these<br />\nsalons have become increasingly<br />\nfrequented by tanners, particularly in the off season. Lynn'<br />\nKowalski, manager of the Offthe-Beach Tanning Spa, a<br />\nBaltimore area tanning salon,<br />\nreports that tanning \"is a thriving business. We get all kinds of<br />\npeople, men and women who are<br />\nlooking to keep up their tan or get<br />\nready with a base tan before they<br />\nvacation.\" Tanning sessions,<br />\nwhich take place in a booth,<br />\nwhere the tanner relaxes for a<br />\nshort amount of time under UV<br />\nlights, provide many people with<br />\nthe delightful result of a yearround tan.<br />\nCautious about the proliferaton<br />\nof the tanning salons is Dr. Paul<br /><br />\nStrickland, assistant professor of<br />\nenvironmental health science at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins School of<br />\nPublic Health. His concerns are<br />\nthat many of the tanning salons do<br />\nnot provide adequate protection<br />\nand information to their.<br />\ncustomers. Furthermore, most<br />\ntanning salons only use lamps<br />\nwhich produce UV-A light,<br />\nunlike the sun, which produces.<br />\nUV-A and UV-If. Strickland feels<br />\nthat many people who get their<br />\ntans at salons unwittingly expose<br />\nthemselves to long hours in the<br />\nsun, thinking that their base tans<br />\nwill protect theni, when in reality they will not. Strickland would<br />\nlike to see more regulation of<br />\nthese spas.<br />\nFor all the concerns of Dr.<br />\nStrickland, however, Ms.<br />\nKowalski points to a pleased<br />\nclientele and has few people who<br />\nburn or experience bad aftereffects. In addition, Off-theBeach provides goggles for its<br />\npatrons and sets tanning times to<br />\nprevent overexposure of zealous<br />\ntanners.<br />\nTanners are here to stay, admit<br />\nmost dermatologists, and it's very<br />\nhard to fight a trend that all the<br />\nbeautiful people seem to be doing. Their hope, however, is that<br />\nmost people will at least be aware<br />\nof the danger and take at least<br />\nminimal precautions to save their<br />\nskin.

The twins, connected at<br />\nthe back of their heads, were<br />\nseparated in a grueling 22-hour<br />\noperation on September 5 and 6.<br />\nA team of over 70 physicians,<br />\nnurses, and health care personnel<br />\nattended the operation.<br />\nThe twins are in a \"critical but<br />\nstable condition\" as this paper<br />\ngoes to press. .Hospital<br />\nspokespersons report that the<br />\ntwins are being slowly weaned<br />\nfrom their drug-induced coma.<br />\nDoctors have kept the twins in an<br />\nartificial state of coma with barbituates since the operation last<br />\nweek in order to promote healing.<br />\nThe prognosis for the 7 month<br />\nold twins seems good\u2014breathing_<br /><br />\nhas returned to normal and their<br />\narms and legs seem to be functioning well. The twins were<br />\nplaced on their stomachs early<br />\nthis week in order to allow the<br />\nwounds in their heads to heal<br />\nquickly. \"It's the first time the<br />\ntwins have probably been lying<br />\non their stomachs ever,\" the<br />\nHospital has noted.<br />\nThe Binder operation was a<br />\nunique opportunity for the<br />\nHopkins staff, the first Siamese<br />\nseparation the Hospital has performed in five years. Doctors used hypothermia and a heart/lung<br />\nbypass machine in order to drain<br />\nthe blood vessels and inactivate<br />\nthe heart and circulatory systems<br />\nfor about an hour. This allowed<br />\nphysicians to separate the major<br />\nsinus vein (located near the brain)<br />\nthat the twins shared. The vein<br />\nwas separated without incident<br />\nand new vessels were constructed<br />\nfor each twin from tissue from<br />\ntheir hearts. The twins had fully<br />\nseparated and normally functioning brains.<br />\nThe twins were in the operating<br /><br />\nroom last Friday again, but this<br />\ntime fOr a routine cleansing of<br />\ntheir wounds in order to prevent<br />\nthe risk of infection. The twohour operation performed on each<br />\ntwin was primarily so surgeons<br />\ncould \u2014 irrigate and cleanse their<br />\nwounds,\" a routine precautionary<br />\nmeasure for major post-operative<br />\nprocedure. The twins were<br />\nreported to have responded well<br />\nto the additional surgery.<br />\nThe next step for the twins is<br />\nto place permanent customdesigned titanium-mesh caps over<br />\nthe openings doctors have cut in<br />\nthe infants' skulls. The procedure<br />\nhas been delayed so far because<br />\nBenjamin has been having a little<br />\nproblem with brain swelling and<br />\nthe doctors want to allow him<br />\nsome more convalescent time.<br />\nPediatricians at the Hospital<br />\nbelieve the Binder twins will<br />\ngrow up to be normal, healthy<br />\nadults, but it is still early ib the<br />\ngame and no one can know for<br />\nsure.

Shortly thereafter, midfielder Dressel picked up a loose<br />\nball at his restraining line and<br />\nfired a cross-field pass to Mitchell, who ran the ball across<br />\nmidfield and passed to Bubier on<br />\nright wing.

So<br />\nthe Blue Jays left Elizabethtown,<br />\nPA with a disappointing 21-12f<br />\nfinal record and faint hopes of<br />\nreceiving an NCAA Tournament<br />\nbid. The bid never came, and the<br />\nteam's disappointment grew<br />\nwhen a long-awaited pair of exhibition games with a team from<br />\nCuba was cancelled at the last<br />\nminute.<br />\nThe Hopkins baseball team had<br />\nproblems from the start. They<br />\nlost four of their first five and<br />\nlooked bad doing it. The Jays<br />\nblew their season-opening game<br />\nagainst Yale by yielding six runs<br />\nto the Bulldogs after two were out<br />\nin the seventh inning. Hopkins<br />\nthen lost again to Yale, had a<br />\ngame with Coppin State suspended due to darkness, were crushed 15-1 by UMBC,and lost 14-7<br />\nto Tufts. Already the Jays had lost<br />\nfour games. A year earlier,<br />\nHopkins had a final record of<br />\n33-5-1, and did not lose their<br />\nfourth game until the thirty-sixth<br />\ngame of the season. A team that<br />\nwas supposed to win, that expected to win, was not winning.<br />\nThe Blue Jays continued to struggle and had a 6-7 record before<br />\nthey came to life and won 15 of<br />\ntheir last 20 contests, but their<br />\n21-12 final record was not good<br />\nenough for an NCAA bid.<br />\nThe main culprits in Hopkins'<br />\nlosses were poor pitching and<br />\neven worse defense. The team's<br />\nERA was 6.42 at the season's<br />\nhalfway mark before recovering<br /><br />\nsomewhat to finish at 4.76. The<br />\nBlue Jays' defense committed 47<br />\nerrors in the first 16 games. The<br />\ndefense improved somewhat<br />\nbefore concluding the '87 season<br />\nwith five errors against Franklin<br />\nand Marshall, five errors against<br />\nUMBC, and four errors against<br />\nGettysburg in the MAC playoffs.<br />\nThe defense allowed a total of 72<br />\nunearned runs to score.<br />\nHopkins' offense, however,<br />\nwas anything but a weakness in<br />\n'87. As a team, they hit .318,<br />\nwith a slugging percentage of<br />\n.459 and an on-base percentage of<br />\n.415. The offense was unstoppable at times, banging out scores<br />\nof 30, 26, 19, 18, 15, 14, 13, 12<br />\nand 10 runs..

Indeed,<br />\nHopkins certainly seemed like a<br />\nteam that needed few adjustments.<br />\nYet, the first four games of the<br />\nseason have been disappointing<br />\nfor the Blue Jays, and they have<br />\nbeen marked by numerous adjustments. The most obvious<br />\nchange is a head coach where<br />\nJohn Haus begins his first year.<br />\nThe other big adjustments have<br />\nbeen on defense where a new<br />\ngoalie and a shuffling of<br />\ndefenders have contributed to the<br />\n2-2 start.<br />\nThe season began with a road<br />\nvictory over St. Mary's. Goals by<br />\nAndy Nicolas, Joe DalPorto, and<br />\nGreg Bronshvag boosted the Jays<br />\nto an easy 3-0 victory. This<br />\nshutout victory certainly gave no<br />\nindications of the defensive<br />\nbreakdown that would occur in<br />\nthe Elizabeth Tournament.<br />\nHopkins opened the tournament againstt-an extremely tough<br />\nregional foe, Christopher<br />\nNewport. In an important game<br />\nfor NCAA consideration, goals<br />\nby Grenville Jones and Craig<br />\nWeinstein were not enough to<br /><br />\n\"<br /><br />\nhold off the Newport onslaught,<br />\nas the Jays fell 4-2. In the next<br />\ngame, Hopkins faced a team from<br />\nCalifornia which they knew<br />\nnothing about. Once again, Jones<br />\ntallied for the Jays, but LaVerne<br />\nscored twice to hand Hopkins<br />\ntheir second straight defeat.<br />\n\"We're not making the other<br />\nteam work,\" said Coach Haus,<br />\n\"and we're giving up easy goals.<br />\nRight now, we're not playing as<br />\nwell as we are capable of<br />\nplaying.\"<br />\nIndeed, the defense has seen<br /><br />\nin time to live up to their preseason expectations? Last<br />\nWednesday's 2-1 victory over<br />\nMarymount was slightly encouraging, but the real tests come<br />\nthis week. The Blue Jays finally<br />\nreturn home to face a strong<br />\nSalisbury team on Wednesday,<br />\nand then face conference rival<br />\nHaverford at Homewood on<br />\nSaturday. If the team can adjust<br />\ndefensively and begin to work<br />\nwell under their rookie coach,<br />\nthey could rebound and regain<br />\ntheir preseason status.<br /><br />\nshould begin to turn around for<br />\nthe Blue Jays, and their potent offensive attack should be able to<br />\ntake over.<br />\nHopkin is filled with firepower<br />\nand experience on offense. The<br />\nbiggest scoring threats are senior<br />\nJones and junior Weinstein.<br />\nKevin Flynn and Nicholas are<br />\nalso proving ..to be dangerous<br />\nscoring threats in the early<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe question remains: Can<br />\nHopkins put it all together and<br />\nmake the necessary adjustments<br /><br />\nBIA news<br />\nwill be at 6:30 pm in the Athletic<br />\nCenter lobby. To enter a team into the league, please bring a $10<br />\nforfeiture fee.

Fullback Bill<br />\nHart is a transfer student who is<br />\njust getting used to the system.<br />\nAll of this shuffling and adjusting<br />\nhas caused confusion, and therefore some easy goals for the opposition.
