The legend of the two lovers dis\u2022<br />\n<br />\nrell<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nturbed him. He was an authority on the<br />\nLatin ruins of southern France, and yet this<br />\ntale was apparently new. It could be but<br />\nthe idle chatter of a garrulous porter, possibly a village fabrication. Still there was<br />\na distinct gap in his knowledge of the ruins<br />\nof St. Remy, and to the delicately trained<br />\nmind there seemed to be here glimmerings<br />\nof truth, of remote facts and interlocking<br />\nconnections which the layman would pass<br />\nover unseeingly. At any rate it was worth<br />\nan investigation. He walked up and down<br />\nuntil far into the night.<br />\nTwo weeks, three weeks, however, a month<br />\nflitted by, and the antiquary, deep in other<br />\nresearches almost forgot the suggestions of<br />\na possible romance that had come with the<br />\nhearing of the legend. He was more than<br />\never fascinated and enraptured with the<br />\nclear, cold beauty which formed the subject<br />\nof his study and would in moments of extravagance even throw his arms about the<br />\nsnowy pillars of the mausoleum and almost<br />\nworship their forms with the delicately<br />\nchiseled capitals. The place was hopelessly<br />\nin ruins, but these columns with part of the<br />\npediment jutted out of the hillside almost<br />\nintact. He seated himself on a stone in<br />\nfront of them one afternoon and began to<br />\nrecall pictures of the life that throbbed on<br />\nthe hill seventeen centuries before. To his<br />\nidealizing fancy there came visions of beautiful women with the chiseled features of<br />\nAthena, and men of Ciceronian clearness of<br />\nmind, all overshadowed by the pure whiteness of these columns.<br />\nThe antiquary looked down on the village<br />\nin the valley beneath him with a gesture of<br />\ncontempt. What, after all, had modern life<br />\nto offer compared with the sublimity of those<br />\nsplendid days. He looked north-westward<br />\ntowards Paris and thought of the grime and<br />\npoverty and sin, the hot, nervous, brilliantly<br />\nscintillating but over excited and jaded life<br />\nof the metropolis. He thought with a shudder of disgust of the railway trains and great<br />\nmills full of machines grinding up men with<br />\nthe iron and cotton. Then he turned once<br />\nmore to the cold beautiful pillars which to<br />\nhim were not so much shapely pieces of marble as embodiments of a national soul, of<br />\na national intelligence now dead. The western sun bathed all below in a soft radiance<br />\nand shot gleams into the cool silent recesses<br />\n<br />\nof the porch where the shadows set off the<br />\ncolumns in chiaroscure and made them seem<br />\neven whiter than before. As he was engaged<br />\nin these reflections his eye wandered over<br />\nthe walls around him, but suddenly stopped<br />\nshort.<br />\nWith the keen sight of a trained investigator he stepped to the stone and brushed<br />\naway a few bits of dirt. A line of mortar<br />\nran straight upward and bent into an arch.<br />\nOne does not stop to think in such cases;<br />\nnor did the antiquary, but flew back to the<br />\nhouse for spade and hammer. A dozen<br />\nmaster strokes reduced the door to ruin.<br />\nHe applied the spade. There was a little<br />\nflying of fine dust, a blinding of mortar, and<br />\nthen the sun gleamed back into the depths<br />\nof a great cavernous hole in the hillside.<br />\nThe mausoleum itself; was ever perplexed<br />\nscholar so lucky. He clapped his hands<br />\nwith glee and danced a funny little wrinkled<br />\ncan-can on the stone flagging; then suddenly<br />\nrecalled himself, chid himself for his folly,<br />\nadjusted his spectacles, and proceeded. The<br />\nvault was damp, cold, and dismal, and oozy<br />\nlittle streams trickled over the walls and<br />\nmade slush upon the floor. There was something uncanny about the whole thing, so<br />\nuncanny that the antiquary shivered, not<br />\nwith cold, but with little creepy feelings up<br />\nand down his backbone. On either side<br />\nloomed, dark and eery, a stone sarcophagus,<br />\nthe only contents of the gloomy place. The<br />\nantiquary lit his lantern and approached one.<br />\nAfter brushing away the accumulated mold<br />\nof seventeen centuries he descried some worn<br />\nletters and read in the Latin:<br />\n\"Tullia, best beloved and slave of Taelus.\"<br />\n\"Ahem,\" chuckled the old man, and he<br />\nput the different parts of the inscription<br />\ntogether and drew his conclusions. Then<br />\nhe espied beneath some smaller letters and<br />\nread:<br />\n\"The gods love surpassingly even in anger, but their anger grows through love.\"<br />\nThe antiquary suddenly recalled the<br />\npeasant legend and nervously brushed off<br />\nmore dirt. The fever of research was beginning to light up his eyes, and excitement<br />\nburned wildly in his veins Without, the<br />\nsun sank lower and gloomier shadows crept<br />\ninto the vault, but he noticed none of this.<br />\nTurning to the other sarcophagus he read:<br />\n\"Corydon, beloved of Taelus.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nand underneath a line from an eclogue of<br />\nVirgil, followed by another inscription:<br />\n\"Who are faithless to the gods shall feel<br />\ntheir anger.\"<br />\nThe antiquary sat down abruptly on the<br />\ndamp floor and ran his hands through his<br />\nhair in the travail of close reasoning.<br />\n\"A peasant legend; ahem; two lovers<br />\nkilled by master, jealous perhaps; of woman<br />\ncertainly; see inscription; then the man;<br />\nahem, yes;\" he paused to run through portions of the eclogue from memory. Two<br />\nJealousies perhaps. The old gentleman's affairs were a bit muddled. And then there<br />\nloomed before his mind the picture Corydon<br />\nand 'Pullin.; a stolen kiss under the soft shade<br />\nof the acacias; the sun in the west and one<br />\nlong, sweet moment compassing the very<br />\nbounds of eternity. Ah, now he saw the<br />\nsoul itself of these tall white columns, the<br />\ngrandeur and beauty, the simplicity and<br />\nsoftness.<br />\nThen across the picture strode a grim, severe man. On his face were marks of sensuality and dissipation and in his eyes<br />\ngleamed the light of cruelty, commingled<br />\nwith a certain maudlin sentimentality, the<br />\nremains of something noble. It was the<br />\npicture of the beast coming forth from the<br />\ndegenerate remains of an originally sturdy<br />\nRoman. There flashes from the brutal face<br />\na gleam of passion, then one of anger. There<br />\n<br />\nis a brow red, perhaps with wine, the flash<br />\nof steel, blood, and then\u2014the mausoleum,<br />\nlast passionate expression of a master's love<br />\nand the two faithful, undutiful loiters lying<br />\nforever in the dank stone with the pale white<br />\npillars without. Now the antiquary saw it<br />\nall, but it was with a shudder.<br />\nAnd this beautiful Roman over which he<br />\nraved; ugh! It was as though the pure<br />\nbeauty of the outside were stripped off and<br />\nhere beneath lay the foul, poisonous miasma<br />\nof a mental pestilence. As he stepped towards the entrance a lizard without whisked<br />\naway into the shadow. The sun had set and<br />\nin the half darkness the marble seemed damp<br />\nand slimy. Even the beautiful capitals were<br />\ncrawly and unholy, and he shuddeded again<br />\nwith horror and disgust and shook himself<br />\nas though to shake off the impurity and bestiality. Slowly and rather sadly he walked<br />\nback to the cottage, and then turned to look<br />\nonce more at the mausoleum.<br />\nIn front he seemed to see again the tall<br />\nbeautiful pillars and the two lovers, spirits<br />\nof a far antiquity, the spirits of the nobility<br />\nof all men; and then across the porch strode<br />\nthe monster, Taelus, and all again was horrible with strange and unspeakable iniquity.<br />\n\"After all, it is nothing but the same old<br />\nlife,\" he sighed; and coldly and wearily<br />\nturned away from the ruined tomb.<br />\n<br />\nTHE SONG.<br />\nOthers may sing of the ocean blue,<br />\nOr the depth of the azure skies,<br />\nOf the Mediterranean's violet hue,<br />\nThe purple hills in the hazy view,<br />\nOr the blue bird bright as it flies.<br />\nBut the song I sing is a different song,<br />\nAnd one which never can be too long,<br />\n\u2014I sing of my darling's eyes.<br />\n<br />\nOthers may sing of the yellow moon,<br />\nOr the sunlight's glittering glare,<br />\nOf buttercups sweet of an early June,<br />\nThe golden light of. the sun at noon,<br />\nOr the yellow daisies so fair.<br />\nBut the song I sing is a different song,<br />\nAnd one which never can be too long,<br />\nI sing of my darling's hair.<br />\n<br />\nOthers may sing of the murmuring brooks,<br />\nOr the light of the stars above,<br />\nOf the quiet joy in the hidden nooks,<br />\nThe stream and woods and the croaking<br />\nrooks,<br />\nOr the call of the cooing dove.<br />\nBut the song 1 sing is a different song,<br />\nAnd one which never can be tog long,<br />\nI sing of my darling love.<br />\n'06.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n=<br />\n<br />\nTHE PLANS FOR HOMEWOOD.<br />\nPresident Remsen gave a very interesting<br />\nlecture in McCoy Hall last Friday .on the subject of the development of Homewood. He<br />\nspoke for the most part of. the laying out of<br />\nthe grounds and of the placing of the buildings, but also of the general style of architecture which was recommended by the<br />\nBoard and which will be followed out in the<br />\nerection of future buildings.<br />\nThe plan adopted was prepared by Parker<br />\nand Thomas, of Baltimore, and was chosen<br />\nfrom among the drawings of five firms of<br />\nNew York, Boston and Baltimore architects.<br />\nThe plan provides for the buildings needed<br />\nfor the immediate work of the University,<br />\nand also shows how these buildings can be<br />\nenlarged and new ones added so as to form<br />\nan harmonious part of the whole scheme.<br />\nPresident Remsen enumerated the buildings<br />\nthat will be necessary before the University<br />\ncan move to its new site. Among these he<br />\nmentioned the following:<br />\nA library; for present and future books to<br />\nnumber about 300,000 volumes.<br />\nA building containing about 20 seminary<br />\nclassrooms, for about 25 students each, arranged like large committee rooms. This<br />\nbuilding may be separate from the library,<br />\nbut conveniently connected with it, or there<br />\nmay be one building containing library and<br />\nthese seminary classrooms.<br />\n\"Levering Hall,\" Young Men's Christian<br />\nAssociation Building.<br />\nA building to contain administrative offices; president's, treasurer's and registrar's<br />\nrooms; an assembly hall to seat 1500 with a<br />\ndancing floor, and a small assembly hall to<br />\nseat about 200. The offices and assembly<br />\nhall may be separated into two buildings, if<br />\nthought desirable.<br />\nOne or two buildings to be two to four<br />\nstories in height and to contain in the aggregate 25 rooms, each seating about 40, to be<br />\nused as classrooms or lecture halls in nonlaboratory subjects.<br />\nSix buildings for laboratory purposes, each<br />\nincluding classrooms and department libraries for subjects mainly taught by laboratory<br />\nmethods, 19,006 square feet each. Two museums in connection with these, 10,000 square<br />\nfeet each. Two other museums one story<br />\nhigh, 10,000 square feet each.<br />\n<br />\nAuditorium for audience of about 2000,<br />\nwith stage, etc. A distinct and somewhat<br />\nmonumental building not necessarily among<br />\nthe first to be erected.<br />\nThree buildings for dormitories, three to<br />\nfive stories, 7500 square feet each.<br />\nDining establishments, with kitchen and<br />\nother domestic offices combined. Seating<br />\nand serving capacity of about 300.<br />\nA building or buildings containing provision for athletics, conveniently located for<br />\neasy access to students, and not necessarily<br />\ncombined with athletic grounds, which will<br />\nprobably be located at a more distant part<br />\nof the site.<br />\nPower-house. Provision will be made for<br />\nsupplying heat, light, etc. from this house<br />\nby underground conduits to all buildings.<br />\nPresident Remsen said he did not want<br />\nanyone to think, because the Chapel was not<br />\nnumbered among the immediate needs of the<br />\nUniversity, that not enough emphasis was<br />\nlaid on the religious side of University life.<br />\nThe Chapel is not one of the absolutely necessary buildings, because the new Levering<br />\nhail, which will be one of the first structures<br />\nto be begun at Homewood, will contain an<br />\nassembly room large enough to be used as<br />\na Chapel for the present.<br />\nIn addition to the outline of the general<br />\nplans for the grounds, Parker and Thomas<br />\nalso offered two specimen buildings with<br />\nfront and side elevations and floor plans.<br />\nThe particular buildings which they took for<br />\nillustration were a laboratory and a museum.<br />\nThe two buildings are designed in a style<br />\nwhich is an adaptation of classic ideas to<br />\nmodern needs. The probability iP that they<br />\nare intended to be constructed of marble and<br />\nthat \"cheerful red brick\" which Baedecker<br />\ndescribes as characteristically Baltimorean.<br />\nIt seems a pity that some form of Gothic<br />\narchitecture was not chosen, better suited,<br />\nperhaps, by its centuries of identification<br />\nwith Anglo-Saxon places of learning, for the<br />\nuse of a great University. The Commission,<br />\nhowever, in their tour of investigation<br />\nthrough the principal colleges of the East<br />\nand Middle West, were best pleased with the<br />\narchitecture of the Universtiy of Virginia.<br />\nThe plan there seemed to be both well suited<br />\nto its purpose and also consistently carried<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nout. This visit to Virginia may have had<br />\nsome influence on their choice. Perhaps also<br />\nthe following paragraph from Dr. Remsen's<br />\nreport may throw some light on the subject:<br />\n\"My preference is decidedly for simple and<br />\ncomparatively inexpensive buildings, though<br />\nI feel very strongly that they should represent a high type of architecture. After consultation with the advisory board and Mr.<br />\nKeyser, I sent the following notice to the<br />\ncompeting architects:<br />\n\"'In regard to the style of architecture<br />\nfor the buildings of the Johns Hopkins University at Homewood, the advisory board<br />\nhereby suggests to the competing architects<br />\nthat their preference is for such buildings<br />\nas are not elaborate and expensive in general<br />\nscheme or detail, but rather for such as are<br />\nsimple and dignified, with characteristics indicative of the purpose, and as inexpensive<br />\nas may be consistent with thoroughly good<br />\nconstruction.'\"<br />\nIn regard to the cost of moving to the<br />\ncountry, President Remsen can give no definite answer, but the following statement<br />\nsounds very encouraging, and leads us to<br />\nhope that the removal may be possible at<br />\nsome time in the near future:<br />\n\"In regard to the sum required to enable<br />\nus to move to Homewood, I do not venture<br />\nhere to make any specific statement; but such<br />\ncalculations as I have been able to make .<br />\n. . convince me that the problem of<br />\nmoving is one that can be solved.\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2014A hustling promoter name Coe<br />\nWas head of a big cocoa Co.<br />\nA native named Koko<br />\nSaid, \"Pay what you owe, Coe,<br />\nOr give me the Coe Cocoa Co.\"<br />\nHe had other projects, had Coe\u2014<br />\nCoke ovens were one line, and so<br />\nThe two coalesced.<br />\nImagine the rest:<br />\n\"Coe-Koko Coke and Cocoa Co!\"<br />\n\u2014Exchange.<br />\n<br />\nChauncey Depew was once asked why a<br />\ncollege man was referred to as \"college<br />\nbred.\" \"I suppose,\" he said, \"it's because<br />\nit is usually a four years' loaf.\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\nCOTILLON CLUB.<br />\nA movement was recently started in the<br />\nUniversity for the purpose of arranging a<br />\nseries of dances to be given through the<br />\nyear, similar to the dances that are given<br />\nin other colleges. The movement has been<br />\nvery enthusiastically carried forward by the<br />\nwhole student body, and has resulted in the<br />\nformation of the Johns Hopkins Cotillon<br />\nClub. Membership in the Club is open to<br />\nany student of the University upon the payment of the dues; these cannot be definitely<br />\nfixed until the number of members is known,<br />\nbut they will certainly be moderate. The<br />\nClub proposes to give four dances during the<br />\nwinter and spring, the dates, as arranged at<br />\npresent, being Wednesday, November 23rd,<br />\nJanuary 6th, February 21st, and April 28th;<br />\nthus the dances will be so distributed that<br />\none will occur at Thanksgiving, one during<br />\nthe Christmas holidays, one at Washington's<br />\nBirthday, and one at Easter.<br />\nThe University has permitted the Club to<br />\nhold the dances in McCoy Hall, on condition<br />\nthat they shall close at twelve. On account<br />\nof the short space of time allowed for the<br />\naffair, dancing will have to start promptly<br />\nat quarter to nine so as to get through in<br />\ntime. There will be twenty dances, with<br />\nan interval of \"twenty minutes for refreshments\" after the tenth dance.

WOLTERECK, box 677, J. H. U.<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nDuring the last two or three years the<br />\nNEWS-LErniR has often heard the question,<br />\noften impatiently asked, why does not the<br />\nUniversity build an athletic field at Homewood? It was argued that even if the plans<br />\nhad not yet been definitely settled, it would<br />\nbe perfectly possible to level off a temporary<br />\nathletic field, which could be moved later<br />\non if the site were needed for buildings. The<br />\nUniversity authorities, however, preferred to<br />\nwait, and then build a permannet athletic<br />\nfield on the site provided for in the plans<br />\nadopted by the Trustees. Now that these<br />\nplans have been decided on, the athletic<br />\nfield is a thing of the immediate future, and<br />\nwill probably be begun very shortly. There<br />\nis a sum amounting to something over $2000<br />\navailable for the work. The one difficulty<br />\nin the case is the distance of the site chosen<br />\nfor the field from the city, and the fact that<br />\nno car line passes anywhere near it.

This would make<br />\nthe tracks pass by the proposed entrance<br />\nto the field on Merryman's Lane. It is expected that the permit for this change in<br />\nthe route of the cars will soon be issued, and<br />\nas soon as it is definitely settled, work on<br />\nthe field at Homewood will begin. It is to<br />\nbe hoped that the first leveling and sodding<br />\nof the ground can be begun this fall, so that<br />\nthe new field will be in condition for lacrosse<br />\nnext spring.<br />\nThe first feed of the Hullabaloo Club was<br />\nheld on Friday, November 4th. Although<br />\neveryone who attended had a very good<br />\ntime, the evening was not such a success<br />\nas had been anticipated, owing largely to<br />\nthe absence of nearly half the Senior class<br />\neither on business, or pleasure, or perhaps<br />\nboth. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the class did not crowd the rooms<br />\nof the Hopkins Club in such numbers as to<br />\nseriously discomfort anybody. The members<br />\nof the committee who made arrangements<br />\nfor the use of the rooms for the feed, were<br />\na little doubtful whether the quarters that<br />\nwere assigned us would be large enough to<br />\ncontain the class; but as it turned out, things<br />\nwould probably have been lonesome if the<br />\nrooms had been any larger. Another thing<br />\nthat detracted from the complete success of<br />\nthe \"feed\" was the early hour at which it<br />\nstopped. This is, perhaps, directly traceable<br />\nto the smallness of the number present. The<br />\nNtWS-LETTF,R does not know a great deal<br />\nabout the feed before half-past ten. According to our ideas no well-regulated feed<br />\nshould ever stop before midnight, at the very<br />\nleast. This feed, however, was otherwise.<br />\nWhatever may have happened before half..<br />\npast ten (and we know of a couple of interesting and heretofore unheard of occurrences), certainly nothing occurred after-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nward.

This is the question which has greeted me on all sides ever<br />\nsince my return to the city after my summer<br />\nvacation. When this article appears in the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, it will be but a short while before the end of the football season; and the<br />\nstudent body will be ready to hear the above<br />\nquestion answered by cold facts.<br />\nOf last year's team we have exactly five<br />\nmen left. These are Dill, Blanck, Strobar,<br />\nMeyer and Morse. It is true that Pearre is<br />\nstill with us, but when the match games begin he will have completed his course at the<br />\nUniversity. Hence, as a nucleus, around<br />\nwhich we are compelled to build up a winning team, we have two attack and three defense men. Of course, we have our faithful<br />\nscrub of last year, but, I may safely say, that<br />\nat present there is no man among them with<br />\nequal ability to any man we lost last spring.<br />\nI am not putting it too strong when I say<br />\nthat Hopkins has a larger gap to fill in her<br />\nline-up this year, than she has for many years<br />\npast. We have lost the best midfield combination which has ever represented the<br />\nblack and blue on the lacrosse field. Neither<br />\nmust we forget Putts, who has held down<br />\nin-home for four successive years. He, with<br />\nStrobar, Rosenheim, Dill, Bird and Mathai<br />\nmay be considered although not the strongest the fastest attack Hopkins has ever had.<br />\nOn the defense we have not lost so many<br />\nmen; nevertheless the three positions that<br />\nare open are the most difficult to fill. The<br />\ngame played by ex-captain Tough at third<br />\ndefense will not be equalled for some time.<br />\nPearre at first defense and Erlanger at goal<br />\nwere very steady players.<br />\n<br />\nW<br />\n<br />\nIn contrast to our loss it may be interesting to know that our strongest opponent,<br />\nSwarthmore, has no less than ten men of<br />\nlast year's team back. To fill one of the two<br />\nopen positions she has a man who is better<br />\nthan many of her last year's regulars. He<br />\ndid not play against us because of an injury<br />\nreceived in practice.<br />\nCan Hopkins beat this team of veterans,<br />\nand how? The first part of this question<br />\nhas but one answer. \"We must beat them,<br />\nor give up our title of the best Lacrosse College in the United\u2022 States.\" The answer to<br />\n\"how\" is that the coaches must get together,<br />\nand with the assistance of the student body,<br />\nas material, hammer together a team which<br />\nwill out-play and if possible, out-weigh<br />\nSwarthmore.<br />\nThere are two fundamental facts which, all<br />\nthe coaches agree, were the cause of our defeat last spring. In the year 1901; almost in<br />\n1903; and in 1904 Swarthmore defeated us<br />\nbecause she out-ran and out-weighed us.<br />\nTo fill the seven open places on our team,<br />\nwe must have men. In answer to the students who hold back on the excuse that they<br />\nhave never had a stick in their hands before,<br />\nwe may say, neither did any of us before we<br />\nentered the Freshman class.

The legend of the two lovers dis\u2022<br /><br />\nrell<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nturbed him. He was an authority on the<br />\nLatin ruins of southern France, and yet this<br />\ntale was apparently new. It could be but<br />\nthe idle chatter of a garrulous porter, possibly a village fabrication. Still there was<br />\na distinct gap in his knowledge of the ruins<br />\nof St. Remy, and to the delicately trained<br />\nmind there seemed to be here glimmerings<br />\nof truth, of remote facts and interlocking<br />\nconnections which the layman would pass<br />\nover unseeingly. At any rate it was worth<br />\nan investigation. He walked up and down<br />\nuntil far into the night.<br />\nTwo weeks, three weeks, however, a month<br />\nflitted by, and the antiquary, deep in other<br />\nresearches almost forgot the suggestions of<br />\na possible romance that had come with the<br />\nhearing of the legend. He was more than<br />\never fascinated and enraptured with the<br />\nclear, cold beauty which formed the subject<br />\nof his study and would in moments of extravagance even throw his arms about the<br />\nsnowy pillars of the mausoleum and almost<br />\nworship their forms with the delicately<br />\nchiseled capitals. The place was hopelessly<br />\nin ruins, but these columns with part of the<br />\npediment jutted out of the hillside almost<br />\nintact. He seated himself on a stone in<br />\nfront of them one afternoon and began to<br />\nrecall pictures of the life that throbbed on<br />\nthe hill seventeen centuries before. To his<br />\nidealizing fancy there came visions of beautiful women with the chiseled features of<br />\nAthena, and men of Ciceronian clearness of<br />\nmind, all overshadowed by the pure whiteness of these columns.<br />\nThe antiquary looked down on the village<br />\nin the valley beneath him with a gesture of<br />\ncontempt. What, after all, had modern life<br />\nto offer compared with the sublimity of those<br />\nsplendid days. He looked north-westward<br />\ntowards Paris and thought of the grime and<br />\npoverty and sin, the hot, nervous, brilliantly<br />\nscintillating but over excited and jaded life<br />\nof the metropolis. He thought with a shudder of disgust of the railway trains and great<br />\nmills full of machines grinding up men with<br />\nthe iron and cotton. Then he turned once<br />\nmore to the cold beautiful pillars which to<br />\nhim were not so much shapely pieces of marble as embodiments of a national soul, of<br />\na national intelligence now dead. The western sun bathed all below in a soft radiance<br />\nand shot gleams into the cool silent recesses<br /><br />\nof the porch where the shadows set off the<br />\ncolumns in chiaroscure and made them seem<br />\neven whiter than before. As he was engaged<br />\nin these reflections his eye wandered over<br />\nthe walls around him, but suddenly stopped<br />\nshort.<br />\nWith the keen sight of a trained investigator he stepped to the stone and brushed<br />\naway a few bits of dirt. A line of mortar<br />\nran straight upward and bent into an arch.<br />\nOne does not stop to think in such cases;<br />\nnor did the antiquary, but flew back to the<br />\nhouse for spade and hammer. A dozen<br />\nmaster strokes reduced the door to ruin.<br />\nHe applied the spade. There was a little<br />\nflying of fine dust, a blinding of mortar, and<br />\nthen the sun gleamed back into the depths<br />\nof a great cavernous hole in the hillside.<br />\nThe mausoleum itself; was ever perplexed<br />\nscholar so lucky. He clapped his hands<br />\nwith glee and danced a funny little wrinkled<br />\ncan-can on the stone flagging; then suddenly<br />\nrecalled himself, chid himself for his folly,<br />\nadjusted his spectacles, and proceeded. The<br />\nvault was damp, cold, and dismal, and oozy<br />\nlittle streams trickled over the walls and<br />\nmade slush upon the floor. There was something uncanny about the whole thing, so<br />\nuncanny that the antiquary shivered, not<br />\nwith cold, but with little creepy feelings up<br />\nand down his backbone. On either side<br />\nloomed, dark and eery, a stone sarcophagus,<br />\nthe only contents of the gloomy place. The<br />\nantiquary lit his lantern and approached one.<br />\nAfter brushing away the accumulated mold<br />\nof seventeen centuries he descried some worn<br />\nletters and read in the Latin:<br />\n\"Tullia, best beloved and slave of Taelus.\"<br />\n\"Ahem,\" chuckled the old man, and he<br />\nput the different parts of the inscription<br />\ntogether and drew his conclusions. Then<br />\nhe espied beneath some smaller letters and<br />\nread:<br />\n\"The gods love surpassingly even in anger, but their anger grows through love.\"<br />\nThe antiquary suddenly recalled the<br />\npeasant legend and nervously brushed off<br />\nmore dirt. The fever of research was beginning to light up his eyes, and excitement<br />\nburned wildly in his veins Without, the<br />\nsun sank lower and gloomier shadows crept<br />\ninto the vault, but he noticed none of this.<br />\nTurning to the other sarcophagus he read:<br />\n\"Corydon, beloved of Taelus.\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nand underneath a line from an eclogue of<br />\nVirgil, followed by another inscription:<br />\n\"Who are faithless to the gods shall feel<br />\ntheir anger.\"<br />\nThe antiquary sat down abruptly on the<br />\ndamp floor and ran his hands through his<br />\nhair in the travail of close reasoning.<br />\n\"A peasant legend; ahem; two lovers<br />\nkilled by master, jealous perhaps; of woman<br />\ncertainly; see inscription; then the man;<br />\nahem, yes;\" he paused to run through portions of the eclogue from memory. Two<br />\nJealousies perhaps. The old gentleman's affairs were a bit muddled. And then there<br />\nloomed before his mind the picture Corydon<br />\nand 'Pullin.; a stolen kiss under the soft shade<br />\nof the acacias; the sun in the west and one<br />\nlong, sweet moment compassing the very<br />\nbounds of eternity. Ah, now he saw the<br />\nsoul itself of these tall white columns, the<br />\ngrandeur and beauty, the simplicity and<br />\nsoftness.<br />\nThen across the picture strode a grim, severe man. On his face were marks of sensuality and dissipation and in his eyes<br />\ngleamed the light of cruelty, commingled<br />\nwith a certain maudlin sentimentality, the<br />\nremains of something noble. It was the<br />\npicture of the beast coming forth from the<br />\ndegenerate remains of an originally sturdy<br />\nRoman. There flashes from the brutal face<br />\na gleam of passion, then one of anger. There<br /><br />\nis a brow red, perhaps with wine, the flash<br />\nof steel, blood, and then\u2014the mausoleum,<br />\nlast passionate expression of a master's love<br />\nand the two faithful, undutiful loiters lying<br />\nforever in the dank stone with the pale white<br />\npillars without. Now the antiquary saw it<br />\nall, but it was with a shudder.<br />\nAnd this beautiful Roman over which he<br />\nraved; ugh! It was as though the pure<br />\nbeauty of the outside were stripped off and<br />\nhere beneath lay the foul, poisonous miasma<br />\nof a mental pestilence. As he stepped towards the entrance a lizard without whisked<br />\naway into the shadow. The sun had set and<br />\nin the half darkness the marble seemed damp<br />\nand slimy. Even the beautiful capitals were<br />\ncrawly and unholy, and he shuddeded again<br />\nwith horror and disgust and shook himself<br />\nas though to shake off the impurity and bestiality. Slowly and rather sadly he walked<br />\nback to the cottage, and then turned to look<br />\nonce more at the mausoleum.<br />\nIn front he seemed to see again the tall<br />\nbeautiful pillars and the two lovers, spirits<br />\nof a far antiquity, the spirits of the nobility<br />\nof all men; and then across the porch strode<br />\nthe monster, Taelus, and all again was horrible with strange and unspeakable iniquity.<br />\n\"After all, it is nothing but the same old<br />\nlife,\" he sighed; and coldly and wearily<br />\nturned away from the ruined tomb.<br /><br />\nTHE SONG.<br />\nOthers may sing of the ocean blue,<br />\nOr the depth of the azure skies,<br />\nOf the Mediterranean's violet hue,<br />\nThe purple hills in the hazy view,<br />\nOr the blue bird bright as it flies.<br />\nBut the song I sing is a different song,<br />\nAnd one which never can be too long,<br />\n\u2014I sing of my darling's eyes.<br /><br />\nOthers may sing of the yellow moon,<br />\nOr the sunlight's glittering glare,<br />\nOf buttercups sweet of an early June,<br />\nThe golden light of. the sun at noon,<br />\nOr the yellow daisies so fair.<br />\nBut the song I sing is a different song,<br />\nAnd one which never can be too long,<br />\nI sing of my darling's hair.<br /><br />\nOthers may sing of the murmuring brooks,<br />\nOr the light of the stars above,<br />\nOf the quiet joy in the hidden nooks,<br />\nThe stream and woods and the croaking<br />\nrooks,<br />\nOr the call of the cooing dove.<br />\nBut the song 1 sing is a different song,<br />\nAnd one which never can be tog long,<br />\nI sing of my darling love.<br />\n'06.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br />\n=<br /><br />\nTHE PLANS FOR HOMEWOOD.<br />\nPresident Remsen gave a very interesting<br />\nlecture in McCoy Hall last Friday .on the subject of the development of Homewood. He<br />\nspoke for the most part of. the laying out of<br />\nthe grounds and of the placing of the buildings, but also of the general style of architecture which was recommended by the<br />\nBoard and which will be followed out in the<br />\nerection of future buildings.<br />\nThe plan adopted was prepared by Parker<br />\nand Thomas, of Baltimore, and was chosen<br />\nfrom among the drawings of five firms of<br />\nNew York, Boston and Baltimore architects.<br />\nThe plan provides for the buildings needed<br />\nfor the immediate work of the University,<br />\nand also shows how these buildings can be<br />\nenlarged and new ones added so as to form<br />\nan harmonious part of the whole scheme.<br />\nPresident Remsen enumerated the buildings<br />\nthat will be necessary before the University<br />\ncan move to its new site. Among these he<br />\nmentioned the following:<br />\nA library; for present and future books to<br />\nnumber about 300,000 volumes.<br />\nA building containing about 20 seminary<br />\nclassrooms, for about 25 students each, arranged like large committee rooms. This<br />\nbuilding may be separate from the library,<br />\nbut conveniently connected with it, or there<br />\nmay be one building containing library and<br />\nthese seminary classrooms.<br />\n\"Levering Hall,\" Young Men's Christian<br />\nAssociation Building.<br />\nA building to contain administrative offices; president's, treasurer's and registrar's<br />\nrooms; an assembly hall to seat 1500 with a<br />\ndancing floor, and a small assembly hall to<br />\nseat about 200. The offices and assembly<br />\nhall may be separated into two buildings, if<br />\nthought desirable.<br />\nOne or two buildings to be two to four<br />\nstories in height and to contain in the aggregate 25 rooms, each seating about 40, to be<br />\nused as classrooms or lecture halls in nonlaboratory subjects.<br />\nSix buildings for laboratory purposes, each<br />\nincluding classrooms and department libraries for subjects mainly taught by laboratory<br />\nmethods, 19,006 square feet each. Two museums in connection with these, 10,000 square<br />\nfeet each. Two other museums one story<br />\nhigh, 10,000 square feet each.<br /><br />\nAuditorium for audience of about 2000,<br />\nwith stage, etc. A distinct and somewhat<br />\nmonumental building not necessarily among<br />\nthe first to be erected.<br />\nThree buildings for dormitories, three to<br />\nfive stories, 7500 square feet each.<br />\nDining establishments, with kitchen and<br />\nother domestic offices combined.

The movement has been<br />\nvery enthusiastically carried forward by the<br />\nwhole student body, and has resulted in the<br />\nformation of the Johns Hopkins Cotillon<br />\nClub. Membership in the Club is open to<br />\nany student of the University upon the payment of the dues; these cannot be definitely<br />\nfixed until the number of members is known,<br />\nbut they will certainly be moderate.

WOLTERECK, box 677, J. H. U.<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nDuring the last two or three years the<br />\nNEWS-LErniR has often heard the question,<br />\noften impatiently asked, why does not the<br />\nUniversity build an athletic field at Homewood? It was argued that even if the plans<br />\nhad not yet been definitely settled, it would<br />\nbe perfectly possible to level off a temporary<br />\nathletic field, which could be moved later<br />\non if the site were needed for buildings. The<br />\nUniversity authorities, however, preferred to<br />\nwait, and then build a permannet athletic<br />\nfield on the site provided for in the plans<br />\nadopted by the Trustees. Now that these<br />\nplans have been decided on, the athletic<br />\nfield is a thing of the immediate future, and<br />\nwill probably be begun very shortly. There<br />\nis a sum amounting to something over $2000<br />\navailable for the work. The one difficulty<br />\nin the case is the distance of the site chosen<br />\nfor the field from the city, and the fact that<br />\nno car line passes anywhere near it. The<br />\nnearest cars are at St. Paul and Thirtyfirst Sts., several squares away. Of course,<br />\nit would be very hard to get any large crowd<br />\nof spectators out to a field so difficult of<br />\naccess, and until the cars are brought nearer,<br />\ngames at such a field could hardly be great<br />\nfinancial successes. People nowadays are<br />\nnot willing to put up with such inconveniences in pursuit of pleasure as they -were<br /><br />\nin the days described in Dr. Renouf's article<br />\nin our last issue, when crowds arrived at<br />\nClifton after a weary ride in the horse-cars,<br />\nfollowed by a walk or 'bus ride to the field.<br />\nHappily, therefore, the problem of how to<br />\nget people out to the Homewood grounds<br />\nhas been nearly settled. A motion is now<br />\nin its third reading in the City Council to<br />\nchange the route of the St. Paul St. cars so<br />\nthat they will run out St. Paul Street (extended), to Merryman's Lane, and thence<br />\nacross to Roland Park. This would make<br />\nthe tracks pass by the proposed entrance<br />\nto the field on Merryman's Lane. It is expected that the permit for this change in<br />\nthe route of the cars will soon be issued, and<br />\nas soon as it is definitely settled, work on<br />\nthe field at Homewood will begin. It is to<br />\nbe hoped that the first leveling and sodding<br />\nof the ground can be begun this fall, so that<br />\nthe new field will be in condition for lacrosse<br />\nnext spring.<br />\nThe first feed of the Hullabaloo Club was<br />\nheld on Friday, November 4th. Although<br />\neveryone who attended had a very good<br />\ntime, the evening was not such a success<br />\nas had been anticipated, owing largely to<br />\nthe absence of nearly half the Senior class<br />\neither on business, or pleasure, or perhaps<br />\nboth. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the class did not crowd the rooms<br />\nof the Hopkins Club in such numbers as to<br />\nseriously discomfort anybody. The members<br />\nof the committee who made arrangements<br />\nfor the use of the rooms for the feed, were<br />\na little doubtful whether the quarters that<br />\nwere assigned us would be large enough to<br />\ncontain the class; but as it turned out, things<br />\nwould probably have been lonesome if the<br />\nrooms had been any larger. Another thing<br />\nthat detracted from the complete success of<br />\nthe \"feed\" was the early hour at which it<br />\nstopped. This is, perhaps, directly traceable<br />\nto the smallness of the number present. The<br />\nNtWS-LETTF,R does not know a great deal<br />\nabout the feed before half-past ten. According to our ideas no well-regulated feed<br />\nshould ever stop before midnight, at the very<br />\nleast. This feed, however, was otherwise.<br />\nWhatever may have happened before half..<br />\npast ten (and we know of a couple of interesting and heretofore unheard of occurrences), certainly nothing occurred after-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nward. Except for a few congenial souls<br />\nthat still basked in the proximity of the<br />\ncopious keg, everyone had adjourned to another room, where some read magazines and<br />\nothers\u2014we hesitate to reveal it\u2014played<br />\nchess! Let us draw the curtain on the<br />\nsolemn scene.<br />\nThe next feed will take place some time<br />\nin the latter part of this month; it is to be<br />\nhoped that the attendance will be larger than<br />\nthe last one.

This is the question which has greeted me on all sides ever<br />\nsince my return to the city after my summer<br />\nvacation. When this article appears in the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, it will be but a short while before the end of the football season; and the<br />\nstudent body will be ready to hear the above<br />\nquestion answered by cold facts.<br />\nOf last year's team we have exactly five<br />\nmen left. These are Dill, Blanck, Strobar,<br />\nMeyer and Morse. It is true that Pearre is<br />\nstill with us, but when the match games begin he will have completed his course at the<br />\nUniversity. Hence, as a nucleus, around<br />\nwhich we are compelled to build up a winning team, we have two attack and three defense men. Of course, we have our faithful<br />\nscrub of last year, but, I may safely say, that<br />\nat present there is no man among them with<br />\nequal ability to any man we lost last spring.<br />\nI am not putting it too strong when I say<br />\nthat Hopkins has a larger gap to fill in her<br />\nline-up this year, than she has for many years<br />\npast. We have lost the best midfield combination which has ever represented the<br />\nblack and blue on the lacrosse field. Neither<br />\nmust we forget Putts, who has held down<br />\nin-home for four successive years. He, with<br />\nStrobar, Rosenheim, Dill, Bird and Mathai<br />\nmay be considered although not the strongest the fastest attack Hopkins has ever had.<br />\nOn the defense we have not lost so many<br />\nmen; nevertheless the three positions that<br />\nare open are the most difficult to fill. The<br />\ngame played by ex-captain Tough at third<br />\ndefense will not be equalled for some time.<br />\nPearre at first defense and Erlanger at goal<br />\nwere very steady players.<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\nIn contrast to our loss it may be interesting to know that our strongest opponent,<br />\nSwarthmore, has no less than ten men of<br />\nlast year's team back. To fill one of the two<br />\nopen positions she has a man who is better<br />\nthan many of her last year's regulars. He<br />\ndid not play against us because of an injury<br />\nreceived in practice.<br />\nCan Hopkins beat this team of veterans,<br />\nand how? The first part of this question<br />\nhas but one answer. \"We must beat them,<br />\nor give up our title of the best Lacrosse College in the United\u2022 States.\" The answer to<br />\n\"how\" is that the coaches must get together,<br />\nand with the assistance of the student body,<br />\nas material, hammer together a team which<br />\nwill out-play and if possible, out-weigh<br />\nSwarthmore.<br />\nThere are two fundamental facts which, all<br />\nthe coaches agree, were the cause of our defeat last spring. In the year 1901; almost in<br />\n1903; and in 1904 Swarthmore defeated us<br />\nbecause she out-ran and out-weighed us.<br />\nTo fill the seven open places on our team,<br />\nwe must have men. In answer to the students who hold back on the excuse that they<br />\nhave never had a stick in their hands before,<br />\nwe may say, neither did any of us before we<br />\nentered the Freshman class. To those who<br />\ngive us the response \"I have never done anything in athletics,\" we in turn reply, neither<br />\nhad many of our best players before they<br />\ntook up lacrosse.
