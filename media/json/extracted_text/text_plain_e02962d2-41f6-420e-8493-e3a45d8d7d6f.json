Under the<br />\nnew orga.nization a pre-medical<br />\ngroup takes its place as one of the<br />\nfour divisions within the college,<br />\nwhile students looking forward to<br />\nlaw now have a specific program of<br />\ncourses suggested.<br />\nFormerly a division of the natural<br />\nscience group, the new pre-med body<br />\nwas formed as an answer to a long<br />\nneed here at the Houpins. In the past,<br />\nstudents preparing for medicine did<br />\nnot have the advantages of a definite<br />\nprogram, but were expected to conform to the requirements of the larger group. Thus courses taken were<br />\nsometimes superfluous but more often<br />\nwere insufficient preparation for specialized studies. This arrangement<br />\nwas particularly inadequate as the<br />\nHopkins has more than her share of<br />\npre-medical students.<br />\n<br />\nSimilar reasons necessitated the<br />\nadvent of pre-law advice. The new<br />\nplan, however, does not divorce this<br />\nbody from the social science group,<br />\nbut merely recognizes it as a well<br />\ndefined part of that group.<br />\nOther changes in the college include an addition to the graduation<br />\nrequirements. Along with the comprehensives, seniors in the natural<br />\nscience or pre-med groups will be<br />\nexpected to present an original essay before a science seminar. This<br />\nsystem, which has seen great success in other schools, is intended to<br />\nfoster thinking and individuality.<br />\nMany courses have 'also been added<br />\nto next year's role. Included among<br />\nthem are quantitative analysis, advanced expository writing, problems<br />\nof philosophy, political parties and<br />\npublic opinion, current problems of<br />\nthe Orient, and a political science<br />\nseminar.<br />\n<br />\nJune Week committee awaits answers from<br />\nbands previously contacted in student poll<br />\nBenny Goodman, Kay Kyser, Glen Gray, and Jimmy Lunceford, of the<br />\nJune Week poll on favorite bands, have been contacted and only await a<br />\nsufficient number of pledges to be contracted, announced the representative<br />\nof the June Week committee who returned from New York Wednesday.<br />\nCount Basic, Hal Kemp, Sammy Kaye, Woody Herman, Gene Krupa,<br />\nHarry James, and Richard Himber also were among the bands<br />\ncontacted.<br />\nIt was reported that tours for all the bands are being arranged now<br />\nand that<br />\nif these bands are to be contracted, action must be taken within the<br />\nnext<br />\nten days.<br />\nVirginia, Pennsylvania, VMI, Washington & Jefferson, and Duke<br />\nare<br />\nall booking bands now, the representative stated.

The reason vouchsaped \u2022 to unsatisfied Barnstormer<br />\nofficers was that numerous social<br />\naffairs occurring the week preceeding, and the week-end of the show,<br />\nMay 13, would probably prevent students from lending their financial<br />\nsupport by purchasing tickets.<br />\nJohn E Desch, director of Barnstormer successes in the past, had<br />\nbeen engaged as director for the<br />\nshow; business, publicity, and production staffs were already busily at<br />\nwork, and the first tryouts had been<br />\nscheduled when S A C flatly refused<br />\nto consider any appropriation justified.

Heart-sick and worried, we<br />\nhave watched the world march on its merry way to<br />\nhell.<br />\nIf we're serious, let's make the strike for peace a<br />\nsincere demonstration of what and how we feel.

But for the present we're<br />\nleft with a bad taste.<br />\n<br />\nGratifying indeed was the<br />\nappearance Monday of<br />\nprinted statements of intention by the Messrs. Williams<br />\nand Butt, candidates for the<br />\nStudent Council presidency.<br />\nThe matter is reprinted in<br />\n<br />\nanother part of this issue.<br />\nSubstantially, the programs are similar.

Carrington Williams has frowned on compulsary assemblies and has<br />\ncome out for a pre-election statement from all candidates on policy.<br />\nIt is significant that at no point do the platforms<br />\nconflict. It would seem that such problems as do face<br />\nthe Council are apparent to both candidates. An analysis and selection of either man on this basis is still<br />\nmost difficult. Perhaps later developments before the<br />\nelection date will aid voters in making their choice.<br />\nBoth men deserve credit, however, for having had<br />\nthe courage, or energy, or initiative to present their<br />\nprospecti. We hope to be able to discuss them more<br />\nspecifically as to merit before election day rolls around.<br />\nMeanwhile, candidates' for senior representative<br />\ncould well follow suit. The NEWS-LETTER and billboard are still available, but the deadline's fast approaching. Next to the president, the senior representation has usually been most important in Council<br />\nactivity.<br />\nThe president is powerless without his Council's<br />\nsupport, and students must elect representatives whose<br />\nprograms are coincident if action is anticipated. Statements of policy become, therefore, ever more important.<br />\nAt long last the Honor<br />\ncommission is tendering its<br />\ncomplete report on the present functioning of the Honor<br />\nsystem to the Council. Today the Council will be able<br />\nto begin a detailed analysis<br />\nof the figures and facts presented, preparatory to unddertaking some definite action.<br />\nWhen the Commissions were set up last year what<br />\nthey were to do was pretty clear to the incumbent Council. Exact definition of their functions seems to have<br />\nbeen lost in the shuffle this year.

The large minority of students<br />\nwho favor isolationism therefore<br />\nshould be silenced, unrepresented at<br />\nthe strike, so that the present communist party line of \"collective secuirity\" may be forced on everyone. This<br />\n\u2018astonishingly bare-faced attempt to<br />\nsuppress opposition on a weak pretext of emergency clearly reveals the<br />\nnature of the blended organizations<br />\nwhich proposed it through their<br />\nspokesman.

Under the<br />\nnew orga.nization a pre-medical<br />\ngroup takes its place as one of the<br />\nfour divisions within the college,<br />\nwhile students looking forward to<br />\nlaw now have a specific program of<br />\ncourses suggested.<br />\nFormerly a division of the natural<br />\nscience group, the new pre-med body<br />\nwas formed as an answer to a long<br />\nneed here at the Houpins. In the past,<br />\nstudents preparing for medicine did<br />\nnot have the advantages of a definite<br />\nprogram, but were expected to conform to the requirements of the larger group. Thus courses taken were<br />\nsometimes superfluous but more often<br />\nwere insufficient preparation for specialized studies. This arrangement<br />\nwas particularly inadequate as the<br />\nHopkins has more than her share of<br />\npre-medical students.<br /><br />\nSimilar reasons necessitated the<br />\nadvent of pre-law advice. The new<br />\nplan, however, does not divorce this<br />\nbody from the social science group,<br />\nbut merely recognizes it as a well<br />\ndefined part of that group.<br />\nOther changes in the college include an addition to the graduation<br />\nrequirements. Along with the comprehensives, seniors in the natural<br />\nscience or pre-med groups will be<br />\nexpected to present an original essay before a science seminar. This<br />\nsystem, which has seen great success in other schools, is intended to<br />\nfoster thinking and individuality.<br />\nMany courses have 'also been added<br />\nto next year's role. Included among<br />\nthem are quantitative analysis, advanced expository writing, problems<br />\nof philosophy, political parties and<br />\npublic opinion, current problems of<br />\nthe Orient, and a political science<br />\nseminar.<br /><br />\nJune Week committee awaits answers from<br />\nbands previously contacted in student poll<br />\nBenny Goodman, Kay Kyser, Glen Gray, and Jimmy Lunceford, of the<br />\nJune Week poll on favorite bands, have been contacted and only await a<br />\nsufficient number of pledges to be contracted, announced the representative<br />\nof the June Week committee who returned from New York Wednesday.<br />\nCount Basic, Hal Kemp, Sammy Kaye, Woody Herman, Gene Krupa,<br />\nHarry James, and Richard Himber also were among the bands<br />\ncontacted.<br />\nIt was reported that tours for all the bands are being arranged now<br />\nand that<br />\nif these bands are to be contracted, action must be taken within the<br />\nnext<br />\nten days.<br />\nVirginia, Pennsylvania, VMI, Washington &amp; Jefferson, and Duke<br />\nare<br />\nall booking bands now, the representative stated.
