Before<br />\nleaving, he said that any further<br />\nattempts concerning governance<br />\nwould have to come from faculty<br />\ninitiatives.<br />\nDisgusted about the poor at:<br />\ntendance of the faculty at last<br />\nFriday's meeting, Guess stated,<br />\n\"It seems to me that since the<br />\nfaculty is portrayed as a kind of<br />\nGod which benevolently takes care<br />\nof its students, maybe we ought<br />\nto let God do it alone.\"<br />\nDr. Woodford Howard, Chairman of the Committee to investigate the degree of dissatisfaction<br />\niabe-out governance, will hold an<br />\nopen meeting today in Shaffer 3<br />\nat 4:00 PM. \"The meeting is being<br />\nheld to hear the views of the unaffiliated,\" Dr. Howard said.<br />\nThe two faculty members<br />\nwho did come to the meeting, Dr.<br />\nDonald Kerr of the Physics Department and Dr. Norman Henley<br />\nof the Russian Department, both<br />\nbad expected better faculty re-<br />\n<br />\nsponse. Dr. Kerr explained,\"Don't<br />\nassume that the faculty is intentionally aloof. Rather, they are<br />\nturned off more by your tone than<br />\nby what you are saying.\"<br />\nDr. Henley suggested that<br />\nthere would be more faculty attending today's meeting because<br />\nit had been planned further in<br />\nadvance and was officially sanctioned.<br />\nGuess admitted that he had<br />\nnot given the faculty much<br />\nadvance notice and that he had<br />\nnot gone through official channels. He said, however, \"One of<br />\nthe reasons for changing the proper channels is so that when students are concerned about some<br />\nissue and the welfare of the University, action can be taken when<br />\nfaculty leadership falters.\"<br />\nGuess explained, \"I called<br />\nmeeting not to fight<br />\nFriday's<br />\nlast<br />\nbut to sit down<br />\nfaculty,<br />\nwith the<br />\nabout the<br />\ntalk<br />\nand<br />\nthem<br />\nwith<br />\nHe<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\ngoals<br />\ncharged that the failure of the present system of governance could<br />\nbe seen by the poor turn-out at<br />\nthe meeting.<br />\nHe said that the Council<br />\n<br />\nwill not cooperate \"until this University truthfully tries to start agaiu.on a basis of trust and a sense<br />\nof community.\"<br />\nGuess was also upset by the<br />\nevents leading up to the Friday<br />\nmeeting.

The Air Force supports<br />\nthe laboratory's research.<br />\nThe laboratory does applied<br />\nand pure research in the fields<br />\nof electronics and electrical engineering. Less than 25% of the<br />\nwork is classified, the present<br />\n$1,200,007 contract runningfrom<br />\nSeptember 1968 until March 1971.<br />\n<br />\nBarton Hall<br />\nBarton Hall was built in 1962<br />\nby the University, under an agreement with the Air Force,in order<br />\nto house the Carlyle Barton labor atory. The agreement stipulates<br />\nthat the Air Force is to reimburse the University on a tenyear plan. By 1972, Hopkins will<br />\nhave been reimbursed by the Air<br />\nForce for all expenses incurred<br />\nin the construction of the facility.<br />\nIn addition to the laboratory, Barton Hall houses a number of faculty offices.<br />\nThe closing of the laboratory<br />\nwill not necessarily meanthe end<br />\nof the military's relationship to<br />\nBarton Hall. Under the original<br />\ncontract, the Department of Defense has priority over the use of<br />\nBarton Hall's space for the next<br />\ntwenty-two years. However, current reports indicate that it is unlikely that the Department of the<br />\nDefense will do anything involving<br />\nBarton Hall without the University's consent.<br />\nDr. Hamburger called the folding of the lab \"a loss to the country.\" He sees the lab shutdown as<br />\nalso hurting the University. According to Hamburger, the shutdown will mean a loss of income<br />\nfor some members of the electrical engineering department<br />\n<br />\nand a loss of support for graduate<br />\nstudents and faculty research.<br />\nThe Barton Lab has done work<br />\nin the area of \"electronic counter-measures.\" One military application of this work is preventing planes from being detected<br />\nby radar.<br />\nBesides electronic countermeasures, the laboratory carries<br />\non \"ferret reconaissance research\", which deals with new<br />\nways of picking up foreign transmissions.<br />\nThe laboratory has also worked on physical prOblems related to Air Force needs,- including infrared problems, laser<br />\nproblems, solid state devices<br />\nand high-frequency antennas.<br />\n<br />\nClassified Research<br />\nIn recent years, there has been<br />\na sharp decrease in the amount<br />\nof classified work being carried<br />\non by the laboratory. From August 1967 to September 1968, the<br />\nlab published 9 trade reports, 2<br />\nof which were classified, 10 internal memos, 3 of which were<br />\nclassified, and 4 quarterly reports, portions of all of which<br />\nwere classified.<br />\nAs little as ten years ago nearly<br />\n50% of the work done by the laboratory was classified.<br />\nThe lab held contracts with the<br />\nAir Force for about $1,000,000<br />\nper year in its early years.In the<br />\nearly sixties contracts were reduced to approximately $900,000<br />\nper year.<br />\nThe size of the contracts remained stable until 1967 when it<br />\nfell from $909,000 to $700,000.<br />\nThe present contract, due to expire in March of 1971, will not<br />\nbe completed as the lab will be<br />\nphased-out over the next six<br />\nmonths.<br />\nDr. Hamburger has been associated with the Barton Lab<br />\nsince its inception in 1954. In<br />\n1956, he took over as acting<br />\ndirector, and as the search for<br />\na director proved fruitless, he<br />\n<br />\nvolunteered and was appointed<br />\nthe new director. The laboratory<br />\nhas continued under his aegis<br />\nuntil the present time<br />\nThe Barton Laboratory had its<br />\nbeginnings at 1315 St. Paul Street.<br />\nIn 1962 the laboratory moved to<br />\nits present site in Barton Hall.<br />\nDr. Hamburger did research<br />\nhimself in the laboratory's early<br />\ndays. However, since takingover<br />\nas director, he has had little<br />\ntime for research. He now supervises the research being carried<br />\non in the laboratory.<br />\nThree faculty members spend<br />\nabout 80% of their time doing<br />\nresearch at the laboratory. About<br />\ntwenty graduate students are connected with the laboratory.<br />\n<br />\nThe Carlyle Barton laboratory now does more than SI million of research for<br />\nthe Air Force in the fields of electronics and electrical engineering. Lab director Dr. Ferdinand Hamburger termed the shut-down of the facilities\"a loss<br />\nto the country.\"<br />\n<br />\nSit-In Organizers Claim Victory<br />\nBy ANDY GREEN<br />\nWhile awaiting a hearing on charges of disorder ly conduct and disturbing the peace,leaders of last<br />\nThursday's anti-draft sit-in at the Customs House<br />\ncalled the demonstration a victory for the local<br />\nanti-war movement.<br />\nLawyers for the forty-one people who were<br />\narrested at the Custom House had no trouble Friday in obtaining a postponement of the hearing<br />\nuntil April 7th. Those arrested had been released<br />\nwithout bail Thursday night from Southeastern<br />\nPolice Station. \"The leniency of the police and<br />\nthe court,\" stated Chris Ohly, a sit-in organizer,<br />\n\"shows that the legal system was made for white<br />\nmiddle class folks like us.\"<br />\n<br />\nSo Committed<br />\nOhly, Larry Goldberg, and David Charry,leaders of the Hopkins Peace Action Committee and<br />\nco-organizers of the sit-in, all felt that the demonstrators had accomplished what they set out<br />\nto do. Commented Charry,\"Our sit-in demonstrated that there were people so committed to end<br />\nthe war that they were willing to go further than<br />\nmarching, that they were even w illing to be arrested.<br />\nGoldberg claimed that the sit-in had also ham-<br />\n<br />\npered the activities of the draft boards housed<br />\nin the Customs House. He cited reports that the<br />\nnumber of people who entered the board Thursday<br />\nwas far below average.<br />\n<br />\nCorrupt System<br />\nThe three leaders contended that Assistant U.S.<br />\nAttorney Alan Barron's refusal to let them enter<br />\nthe Customs House demonstrated the corrupt<br />\nnature of \"the system.\" \"There is something<br />\nwrong with the Government being afraid of us<br />\nbecause we were confronting them with a moral<br />\nissue,\" asserted Goldberg. Agreeing with Goldberg, Charry stated, \"When people are afraid<br />\nof ideas, it shows that there is something wrong<br />\nwith their system.\"<br />\n\"Barron was violating those very laws that he<br />\nwas supposedly hired to protect,\" said Ohly.<br />\nThe group's lawyers are planning to enter a<br />\nplea of not guilty at the April 7th hearing. Ohly<br />\nfelt that a vindication of the protest action by<br />\nthe court would encourage more people to join<br />\nsimilar demonstrations against war taxes on<br />\nApril 15. The defendants are planning to meet<br />\nwith their lawyers next week to plan court strategy.<br />\nThe Peace Action Committee plans to follow up<br />\nthe sit-in action with a disruption of Sikorsky<br />\nAircraft's recruiting on campus tomorrow.Sikorsky makes helicopters that are used in Vietnam.<br />\n<br />\nAFL-CIO Panel Finds 1199-E Guilty of Slander<br />\nIn two successive decisions by impartial AFL-CIO<br />\numpires, Nursing Home and Hospital Employees Union<br />\nLocal 1199E has been found guilty of making slanderous<br />\nattacks on Laborers' International Union Locals 1231 and<br />\n1273.<br />\nOne of the decisions came in early December, just two<br />\ndays before a scheduled election-with only 1231 on the<br />\nballot was postponed by a Federal District Court injunction.

For<br />\nothers it means a bleary-eyed 9 a.m.Abnormal Psychology class. Many don't<br />\neven make the connection--after all, they<br />\ndon't name buildings after living people,<br />\ndo they?<br />\nNot only is G. Wilson Shaffer alive and<br />\nwell, but, along with professorial duties,<br />\nhe is director of what is probably the best<br />\nuniversity psychological clinic in the<br />\ncountry. And not only is he the director,<br />\nbut he also started it and virtually single handedly built it up to its present status.<br />\nBut much of that work was done in his<br />\nspare time. Through most of those years<br />\n\u2022he also happened to be Dean of Homewood. Even that is only one aspect of Dr.<br />\nShaffer's remarkable 50-year association with Johns Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nSuperman Shaffer<br />\nShaffer came to Hopkins in 1920 after<br />\ngraduating from Baltimore City College.<br />\nHe played class baseball, was vice -president of the freshman class, was on the<br />\ninterfraternity board (he was a member<br />\nof now-defunct Kappa Sigma), chairman of<br />\nthe frerthman dance committee, and a<br />\nmember of the musical club.<br />\nHe was an outstanding athlete, and<br />\ncombined dancing and gymnastics in an<br />\nact which observers say, even today,<br />\nhas never been surpassed. The 1924<br />\nHullabaloo states, in part: \"Shaf of the<br />\nShuffling Shoes,...whose performance<br />\nwas a feature on the program of the<br />\nconcerts of the Musical Club.It was after<br />\none of the concerts that a sweet young<br />\nthing asked if Shaf possessed a pair of<br />\nball-bearing hips. If you have ever seen<br />\n<br />\nhim dance, you may judge for yourself.\"<br />\nHis athletic ability was such that he<br />\nwas disqualified from varsity competition (he lost his amateur status as a<br />\nsophomore in high school), and, upon<br />\ngraduation he had offers from professional baseball, football and basketball<br />\nteams. He signed a baseball contract(reputedly with the N. Y.Giants)but a childhood finger injury hampered him and he<br />\ndecided to return to Hopkins for his Ph.D.<br />\nHis finest hour here, he says, was when<br />\nhe struck out 18 batters in a seven-inning fraternity game.<br />\nShaffer received his Ph.D in psychology in 1928. Besides teaching here,<br />\nhe joined the staff of Sheppard-Pratt Hospital, worked in the Student Health Service<br />\non campus,and wrote a textbook on abnormal psychologY. His involvement with<br />\nsports, however, was far from over.<br />\nImproves Sports<br />\nIn 1933 President Ames appointed a<br />\ncommittee to look into the sports program on campus, with a view to expanding intramurals and dropping football.<br />\nThe program was then run by an alumnidominated Athletic Association, and students had a choice between joining a team,<br />\nentering ROTC or taking'physical training.' \"Physical Training,\" Shaffer noted,<br />\n\"usually meant the assistant football<br />\ncoach meeting them on rare occasions<br />\nwith an overcoat on, going 1-2-3-4.\"<br />\nUnder Shaffer, the committee changed<br />\nthis. Football was not dropped, and five<br />\nnew sports were added. The one-year<br />\ngym requirement was added, but with<br />\nemphasis on sports rather than gymnastics. A gymnasium was built that cost<br />\n$30,000 and is still standing. Most important, however,the committee abolished the entrance fee to all sports events.<br />\n<br />\nThe free admissions policy, which finally fell this year, was revolutionary at<br />\nthe time and still almost unique even recently. For thirty years, Hopkins was<br />\nvirtually the only school where anyone<br />\ncould walk in and watch any sports event,<br />\neven national champion lacrosse games.<br />\n\"I can't help but be disappointed about<br />\nthe admissions charge,\" Shaffer stated.<br />\n\"What I tried to accomplish is no longer<br />\npossible. What the NCAA and the colleges<br />\nhave done to football, though,is terrible.<br />\nEveryone is watching the game of the week<br />\ninstead of watching their own kids play.<br />\nInstead of getting scholarships, the athletes should be getting real big salaries.<br />\nI think a distinction should be made between recreation and public amusement.\"<br />\n<br />\nStarts Clinic<br />\nIn 1936 Shaffer started the psychological clinic as a part of the Student Health<br />\nService, and staffed it himself. Due to the<br />\nstigma<br />\nsurrounding therapy, it grew<br />\nslowly; however, two part-time psychologists he hired to help him out soon quit<br />\nbecause of overwork. After the war,with<br />\nthe dramatic rise in the number of students on campus, he worked out an arrangement with the Phipps Clinic of the<br />\nHopkins Hospital to have a number of psychiatrists and first-year residents work<br />\npart-time at Homewood. This program<br />\nhas now expanded to include such work<br />\nas part of the residents' training.<br />\nMeantime, in 1942, Shaffer became<br />\nDean of Arts and Sciences, a post which<br />\nhad responsibility for all underclassmen and all non-engineering upperclassmen, as well as admissions (until 1945)<br />\nand alumni relations (until 1946). He<br />\nwas also, in effect, Dean of Students, a<br />\npost which was not created until 1951.<br />\nFerdinand Hamburger, Chairman of the<br />\nElectrical Engineering Department and<br />\n<br />\na long-time friend of Shaffer, said,\"Wilson and Stuart (Stuart McCauley, provost) ran this place by themselves pretty<br />\nmuch.\"<br />\nIn 1948 there was a reshuffling of administrative positions and Shaffer became Dean of the Homewood Schools,<br />\noverseeing the School of Engineering,<br />\nthe School of Arts and Sciences, and<br />\nthe Evening College. He held the position until 1967.<br />\nIncredible Feat<br />\nThroughout the past 34 years Shaffer<br />\nhas also remained Director of the Psychological Clinic, and from 1946 to 1967<br />\nhe maintained one office in Homewood<br />\nHouse and one in the White House. Although he claims \"it never made any'<br />\ndifference that I was director and Dean<br />\nat the same time,\" this feat is precise'<br />\nly what draws much praise from his<br />\nassociates.<br />\nDr. Lee Park, a psychiatrist at PhiPPs<br />\nClinic, said, \"The amazing thing about<br />\nhim is that he was able to establish his<br />\nintegrity with the students, so that the<br />\nfact that he was the administrative and<br />\ndisciplinary authority on campus had<br />\nno effect upon their coming to him with<br />\nproblems and confessions. People would<br />\neven tell him that they had stolen or<br />\ncheated.\"<br />\nPark terms Shaffer \"extremely forward-looking,\" and Osmar Steinwald,<br />\none of Shaffer's classmates and now Director of Alumnt, Relations, called his<br />\n\"revolutionary.\" He added,<br />\nClinic<br />\n\"There weren't many places a boy could<br />\nturn to back then. Many are still grateful for his guidance.\" Dr. Alsoph Corwin of Chemistry remarked, \"I doubt if<br />\ntwo or three universities in the country<br />\nhave men of comparable ability to clothe<br />\njob.\"<br />\n<br />\nStudents Charge New Ad Hoc Committee Undermines SAC<br />\nBy HOWARD LEVENSON<br />\nCertain students have sharply attacked President Gordon's<br />\nAd Hoc Committee on development of a temporary student union for Homewood.<br />\nThey charge that it was deliberately established to undermine<br />\nthe Student Affairs Committee,<br />\nand that the chairman of the new<br />\ncommittee hasn't adequately consulted with students.<br />\nThe Ad Hoc Committee favors<br />\nShriver Hall for an interim facility.<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee<br />\nhas already set up a sub-committee to look into the problem of a<br />\npermanent facility. Subcommittee<br />\nchairman Chris Ohly thinks that<br />\npower considerations were behind Gordon's decision to have<br />\nDr. William Bevan, the UniverProvost, set up a second<br />\nsity<br />\ncommittee.<br />\n<br />\nSAC Weakened?<br />\nOhly says, \"I have a feeling<br />\nthat Gordon doesn't want to give<br />\nup his power to the SAC.His overall policy is to undermine the<br />\ninfluence of the subcommittees<br />\nwhich he sets up. An ad hoc committee can be set up or dissolved<br />\nas he pleases. If he is unpleas-<br />\n<br />\ned, he can take all the credit.\"<br />\nRichard Cramer, an undergraduate member of the Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee, agrees that power<br />\nwas improperly removed from<br />\nthe SAC,the first group to become<br />\ninvolved in the issue. Cramer<br />\nfeels that Dr. Bevan took the matter out of the SAC's hands \"apparently because they did too<br />\ngood a job.\"<br />\nThe decision-making processes of Ad Hoc Committee Chairman John McElwee, Director of<br />\nPlant Planning, were also questioned.<br />\nIn a preliminary report dated<br />\nFebruary 20, McElwee said his<br />\nviews on a student union came<br />\nafter \"extensive canvassing of<br />\nstudent groups, and \"many hours,<br />\nof deliberations among the students, faculty, and the administration.\"<br />\n<br />\nIII-Advised<br />\nCramer, however,commenting<br />\non the report, said that the committee had met only once before<br />\nMcElwee's distribution of the<br />\nreport. \"McElwee asked me a<br />\nfew very general questions. I<br />\ngave him very general answers.<br />\nHe came out with very specific,<br />\nill-advised proposals--and ab-<br />\n<br />\nsurd space allocations.\"<br />\nCramer's specific criticisms<br />\nof the McElwee report center on<br />\nhis feeling that they over-emphasize<br />\nfacilities for large<br />\ngroups, rather than reflecting the<br />\nindividual-orientation of the Hopkins campus.<br />\nAt a second meeting of the Ad<br />\n<br />\nHoc Committee on March 13,<br />\nMcElwee made plans for cooperating with the SAC subcommittee. The critics, though, still<br />\nask why two committees say that<br />\nthe SAC subcommittee will benefit from McElwee's technical expertise, and that he in turn will<br />\ngain from the SAC's closeness<br />\n<br />\nto students.<br />\nalternate<br />\nWhile presenting<br />\nplans for the renovation of Shriver Hall or Whitehead Hall, McElwee emphasized the advantages<br />\nof Shriver as a temporary student union. He said that shrive\"<br />\nwould be easier and cheaper to do<br />\nover.<br />\n<br />\nRaise in Rents Angers Students<br />\nWhile the Administration's rent<br />\nincrease is angering many students, the grad students' threatened rent strike is gaining strength.<br />\nRents will be raised in the<br />\ngrad dorms of McCoy, Wolman<br />\nand Bradford by 5%, without<br />\nswitchboard service. In the undergraduate dorms, they'll be<br />\nraised by 15%.<br />\nAlthough the grad students have<br />\nabandoned their March 20 ultimatum date for the strike, Dr.<br />\nRobert Bilgrave, Director of Student Affairs, met with them Monday to discuss their grievances.<br />\nOf the more than 350 students in<br />\nthe grad dorms, more than 105<br />\nrent-payers<br />\nhave committed<br />\nthemselves to a rent strike if<br />\nnecessary.<br />\n<br />\npetition they've signed<br />\nThe<br />\nlists ten demands on the administration dealing with building<br />\npriorities, dormitory allocation<br />\nand the size of the undergraduate<br />\npopulation.<br />\n\"We're being caught in the<br />\nwage-price squeeze,\" says grad<br />\nrent strike leader Ray Copson.<br />\nHe adds, \"All the prices are going up, but most of the stipends<br />\nwill probably be staying the<br />\nsame.\"<br />\nStipends, though, may be adjusted in some departments in<br />\nview of the rent hike. As far as<br />\nundergraduates are concerned,<br />\nthe Office of Financial Aid hints<br />\nthat more money will be available to needy students living in<br />\nthe dorms.<br />\nStudents are angered not only<br />\n<br />\nby the hike itself, but also by the<br />\nway the decision was made.<br />\nDavid Barret, a grad student<br />\nIn chemistry, charges that the<br />\nUniversity ignored the committee structure that exists at Hopkins when they made the rent increase decision.<br />\nOther students, however, are<br />\nnot so critical.<br />\nGrad student Bud Graves, for<br />\nexample, feels that the rent increase was inevitable, and he<br />\npoints out that dorm charges are<br />\nstill lower than most rents inthe<br />\nsurrounding neighborhood.<br />\nOn the other hand, Bob Cotter,<br />\npresident of the Grad Student<br />\nOrganization, thinks that the<br />\nUniversity is playing one group<br />\nagainst another.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMarch 24, 1970<br />\n<br />\nEmployeesSometimes MonitorSDSPhones<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\n\"I think that we're all very fortunate<br />\nthat Steve Blumenthal is no longer with<br />\nthe telephone company,\" Schisler concluded.<br />\nBlumenthal told the Senate Commit'tee that present telephone equipment<br />\nallows test deskmen to monitor any phone<br />\ncall in the 235, 243, 338, 366, 467 and<br />\n889 exchanges.<br />\n\"In the evenings,\" Blumenthal testified, \"the men who work the test boards<br />\nknow numbers and conversations they<br />\nmight want to listen to and just tune in.<br />\nThere's nothing malicious to it, really-it's just something to do when you're<br />\nbored, which is often.<br />\n\"Sometimes they pick up the conversations of members of the Students for a<br />\nDemocratic Society, but the favorities<br />\nactually are a couple of whorehouses in<br />\n\u2022<br />\nEil<br />\n<br />\nthe neighborhood.\"<br />\nTo Blumenthal, however, the greatest<br />\ndangers to the monitoring of phones lie<br />\nin the future. \"What I'm worried about<br />\nis not sinister activity on the part of the<br />\nphone company, but the tremendous potential for sinister activity that now exists.<br />\n\"The company has official policy<br />\nagainst unauthorized monitoring, but until<br />\nit is given the force of law, the policy<br />\ncan and has been ignored and disobeyed.\"<br />\nDavid Lorton illustrated a case in point<br />\nto the Committee.

The bill, aimed at correcting these loop:<br />\nholes, has encountered the studied, even ferocious opposition_ of the phone company in the legislature. Instead<br />\nof welcoming public interest in correcting abuses within<br />\ntheir organizatior. the phone company, through its public<br />\nrelations spokesman, asserted, \"I think that we're all very<br />\nfortunate that Steve Blumenthal is no longer with the<br />\ntelephone company.\"<br />\nWithout Blumenthal, though, we would never have<br />\nknown (or thought about) how easily our phones can be<br />\nand sometimes are monitored. Yet it is not the present<br />\nmisuse of telephone equipment that is so shocking, but<br />\nthe potentialities for much more threatening abuses such<br />\nas blackmail, political spying or organized crime operations. Presently there are no specific public regulations<br />\nthat would prohibit such activities.<br />\nWhen the News-Letter first began acquiring information for the phone company story, we checked with the<br />\nTest Center's management for some facts about their<br />\nequipment. Their response was total paranoia; only a<br />\nsecurity officer could speak and he accused the N-L reporter of being a member of the SDS\u2014because the reporter<br />\n. asked the age of the machinery in the 31st Street Building.<br />\nIf the phone bill does pass the state legislature, it will<br />\nbe a big step in channeling public outrage into a constructive law intended to improve our quickly vanishing privacy.<br />\nSenator Julian Lapides, the bill's sponsor, should be complimented for his immediate interest and quick action in<br />\nthis issue, as well as the students, especially Blumenthal,<br />\nwho had the guts to expose the misuse of telephone equipment.<br />\nAnd finally, the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone<br />\nshould be condemned for its pressure politics and flagrant<br />\ndisregard for the public interest. It remained for Steve<br />\nBlumenthal to unveil the inadequacies in the phone company's tightfisted bureaucracy\u2014and maybe now this corrupt Goliath can be forced to adhere to the responsibilities<br />\nwe always assumed it obeyed.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nHOPKINS AND VIETNAM<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nMr. Gordon asks for a chance to respond in<br />\nwriting to questions about his views. I would offer<br />\nhim some questions:<br />\n1) Does your conscience bother you when<br />\nyou remember that APL satellites guide<br />\nbombers to murder and mutilate Vietnamese babies?<br />\n2) Does your conscience bother you when<br />\nyou read that the junta you installed in<br />\nBrazil in 1964, the junta you praised so<br />\neffusively, is stepping up the torture of<br />\npolitical prisoners? Perhaps the unhinder ed flow of Hanna Mining Co. profits back<br />\nto your friends in the states softens your<br />\ntwinges of guilt?<br />\n3) Does it bother your conscience that<br />\nAPL prostitutes science in the same way<br />\nyou prostituted your office in Brazil?<br />\n4) How much of a part did McCloy, friend<br />\nof Krupp, I. G. Farben and Hanna, play in<br />\nmaking a two-bit triggerman for the C.I.A.<br />\nPresident of a once proud university?<br />\nWhen you come up with some answers to these<br />\nquestions, then people will be able to put into context whatever other views you may express. The<br />\nmoral issue of this University's complicity in<br />\nplanning and carrying out the criminal war against<br />\nVietnam is starkly clear,whether you can see it or<br />\nnot. You have time and time again said that neither<br />\nyou nor the University give a shit for morality.<br />\nThe name of the game at Hopkins is money and<br />\npower. The Trustees' money has bought for them<br />\nthe power of directing this University's priorities,<br />\nand it is this power that those of us who would keep<br />\nfaith with our consciences must confront. We don't<br />\nneed some liberal committee's bullshit proposals.<br />\nIf we are to keep any shred of morality, we must<br />\naccept only one thing from the Trustees, and that<br />\nis an end to the prostitution of APL.<br />\nMarion Jango Delgado<br />\n<br />\nON OLANDER<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWe believe this article \"On Women's Lib\" by<br />\nChristopher Olander; N-L, March 17 grossly<br />\nmisrepresents the Women's Liberation Movement<br />\nas it exists today. Its most obvious fault is its<br />\nblatant distortion of fact. Citing two individual<br />\npassages, in two individual articles, by two individual women in a movement numbering well into<br />\nthe thousands, Mr.Olander generalizes from them<br />\nthat \"Most of the spokeswomen for the 'movement' demand what amounts to abstinence,\" and<br />\nthat \"Women's Lib. believes love to be outmoded<br />\nand useless.' Quite clearly no attempt was made<br />\nto present the spectrum of opinion, present as it<br />\nis in any political movement,among Women's Liberation groups. No attempt was made to contact<br />\nBaltimore Women's Liberation groups or read<br />\nthe magazine put out by members of these Baltimore groups, WOMEN: A JOURNAL OF LIBERATION (circulation of which, by the way,triples that<br />\nof No More Fun and Games.) As is so often done<br />\nby the establishment press, the article exploits<br />\nthe novelty of Women's Liberation and its feminist<br />\napproach and makes it an object of ridicule,rather<br />\nthan attempting to get into the issues at hand.<br />\nThe author does show some insight into the problems of women as he quotes and accepts the ideas<br />\nof Simone de Beauvoir; but then, in real ignorance<br />\nof what Women's Liberation is about, these ideas<br />\nare superficially rejected as irrelevent to the<br />\nMovement. What is most offensive about the article,<br />\nthen, is its total insensitivity to the kind of oppression women feel, not simply on the job or in the<br />\nhome, but on a perpetual gut level of our sexuality<br />\nAlthough we reject abstinence and masturbation as<br />\nsolutions to the problem of women's oppression,we<br />\n<br />\nTHE Minlisr-R(oF<br />\nINToRioR<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nus vt/ si-looLp<br />\nSi-lcor FOR A<br />\nZEFW &1<rv\u2018Tri4<br />\nRAT!<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Field Enterprises, In, 1910<br />\n<br />\nMarch 24, 1970<br />\n<br />\nrTh<br />\n<br />\nacknowledge the same frustration expressed by our<br />\nsisters in the traditional feminine role. The passive, deferential, sexually objective and essentially maternal roles women have been conditioned to<br />\nplay in all aspects of our lives we challange as<br />\nuntrue to our humanity. Accordingly, we feel we<br />\nmust first re-examine all areas of our lives and<br />\nthen, with hightened consciousness, demand an end<br />\nto this automatic playing of roles.<br />\nRegarding sexual relationships, with which the<br />\narticle seems especially concerned, we do refuse<br />\nto tolerate being used as a sex object for the gratification of men with no regard for ourselves as<br />\npeople. This may seem to indicate we simply reject our traditional passive role in sexual relationships and let our repressed \"natural desire<br />\nand behavior\" come forth.

Doug Honig and Stu Kahl led the Blue Jay scoring with two goals apiivce, rionig with an assist also to his<br />\ncredit. Other goal producers for Hopkins were Bill Donovan, Doug Fuchs, Danny Hall, and Gary Handleman.<br />\nThe overall team defense was very strong, allowing<br />\nonly one goal when at full strength, this occurring late<br />\nin the fourth quarter. Notable play was turned in by all<br />\nthree front line defensemen. Bob MacCool and Ex Pack<br />\nplayer all American Paul Weiss completely shut-off Yale's'<br />\nattackmen when they tried to go one-on-one near the<br />\ncrease, and sophomore Joe Cieslowski showed exceptional speed in his clearing rushes upheld.<br />\nGoalie Ken Dauses played an exceptional game. Dauses<br />\nhas good moves and clears quickly and accurately upfield.<br />\nIt's almost like a fast break pass in basketball. Dauses<br />\n<br />\nhad 14 saves, and allowed two of the three goals. Second<br />\nstring goalie Pete Conti permitted the third Yale tally.<br />\n<br />\nMiddies Potent<br />\nOffensively, the team played sloppily at times,and well<br />\nin spurts through the four periods. The middies were a<br />\nmore potent group than the attackmen, scoring five of the<br />\neight Hopkins goals. Although Mid-fielder Charlie Coker<br />\ndid not score,(he had one assist)he is the man who moves<br />\nthe offense. He took one backhand \"Shovel\" shot from<br />\nabout 40 feet which was incredible. It hit the goal post.<br />\nSophomore Gary Handleman scored his first varsity<br />\ngoal against Yale and should prove to be a strong contributor to the Blue Jay's offense.<br />\nYale tallied first in the game on a goal by Tom Fagan<br />\nwith Hopkins shy three men. Hopkins took the lead after<br />\nan unassisted goal by Bill Donovanw hen Doug Fuchs scooped up a loose ball in front of the Yale goal and put it in<br />\nthe net. Fagan then scored his second goal of the game<br />\nwith Hopkins shorthanded once again. However, from that<br />\n<br />\npoint on, it was all Hopkins as the Blue Jays netted five<br />\nconsecutive goals.<br />\nOverall, the team took 44 shots on goal as oppossed<br />\nto 25 by Yale.The Blue Jays outhustled and outplayed Yale<br />\nfor most of the game.They also showed themselves to be a<br />\ntough physical unit.<br />\nYale was considered a strOng opponent. It had tied for<br />\nthe Ivy title last year and had given both the Long Island<br />\nlacrosse club, the top lacross club of last year, and the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia, a contender for the national championship, close scrimmages earlier this season.<br />\nAlthough the coaching staff would like to see more goals<br />\nscored, and crisper overall offensive play, there is a<br />\nfeeling that this will come with time, as the mid-fielders<br />\nand attackmen learn to play more cohesively with each<br />\nother.<br />\nCoach Scott though, cannot help smiling at the thought<br />\nof the play of his defense and goalie.It was as good, if not<br />\nbetter, than he had expected for the first game of the season.<br />\n<br />\n4t.<br />\nZrOlt1<br />\n4M,t.:<br />\n<br />\n7.<br />\n4t<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 1214\"'' \"itaCiejkitti<br />\n,<br />\n(414461111..\"41r.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins stickmen battle for a loose ball around the home team's cage while goalie Ken<br />\nDauses looks on.

PETER<br />\nLate last spring Coach Gary Barrett submitted his resignation<br />\nfrom the Coaches' staff here at Hopkins. It is unfortunate that he<br />\npostponed his decision so late into the season.The repercussions are<br />\nnow being felt by the Athletic Office.<br />\nBecause the resignation came so late in the season, there was no<br />\ntime available to screen applicants and select a full-time varsity<br />\nsoccer and baseball coach to replace Barrett. Marshall Turner.<br />\nDirector of Athletics here at Hopkins,was forced to rely on part-time<br />\ncoaches for baseball and soccer. It isn't a question of ability on the<br />\npart of the coaches, but one of the importance of having a full-time<br />\ncoach in these sports.<br />\nA part-time coach is in a very unfortunate position. He is expected to come up with a good ballclub if the talent is there, yet is unable<br />\nto perform any other of the duties of head coach, other than running<br />\ndaily practice.<br />\nThere is much more to running a ballclub than simply calling practices and picking starters. The part-time coach cannot spend any<br />\ntime a tall developing younger ballplayers who must later take over<br />\nfor graduating seniors. A part-time coach has no time at all to devote<br />\nin recruiting scholar-athletes, and this hurts the clubs as well.<br />\nA coach must be in a position to formulate and develop long range<br />\nplans for his club, as well as run the club on a game-to-game basis.<br />\nIn short, a part-time coach, regardless of how dedicated he might be,<br />\ncannot perform all the duties required of a college varsity coach.<br />\nWhat has happened with Mr. Turner havingtoo little time to secure<br />\nanother coach is that he was forced to enter into his budget the<br />\nsalaries of his two part-time coaches, rather than the single fulltime salary. This is of course cheaper, but in no way beneficial to the<br />\nAthletic program here.<br />\nWith the University experiencing a budgetary crisis, orders from<br />\nthe top requiring all vacancies in the various departments to remain<br />\nthat way, and all staff positions to remain unchanged, the Athletic<br />\nCenter is now in an unfortunate position.<br />\nFirst, these policy changes forbid Mr. Turner from finding a fulltime coach to fill Mr.Barrett's vacancy.Second,the prospects of Mr.<br />\n, Turner being given permission to do so in the near future are bleak.<br />\nThe permission could not come until the extra money for a fulltime<br />\nsalary was re-granted to the Athletic Center's budget.<br />\nI think that Mr. Turner should be allowed to find a coach to fill<br />\nBarrett's vacancy, since the position opened up before the order<br />\ncame down to leave positions open. It is unfair to take away from<br />\nthe Hopkins' Athletic Program something as vital as a full-time coach<br />\nfor two varsity sports. It is my opinion that Hopkins' athletics is<br />\n\"taking it on the chin.\" This is not even a question of asking for<br />\nanother coach, but simply asking for a replacement. I can see no<br />\njustification in holding up the hiring of a new coach.<br />\n<br />\nBaseball Gets Lost In the Shuffle<br />\nBy CHARLEY POOLE<br />\nYes, Virginia, the Hop does<br />\nhave a baseball team.

The Air Force supports<br />\nthe laboratory's research.<br />\nThe laboratory does applied<br />\nand pure research in the fields<br />\nof electronics and electrical engineering. Less than 25% of the<br />\nwork is classified, the present<br />\n$1,200,007 contract runningfrom<br />\nSeptember 1968 until March 1971.<br /><br />\nBarton Hall<br />\nBarton Hall was built in 1962<br />\nby the University, under an agreement with the Air Force,in order<br />\nto house the Carlyle Barton labor atory. The agreement stipulates<br />\nthat the Air Force is to reimburse the University on a tenyear plan. By 1972, Hopkins will<br />\nhave been reimbursed by the Air<br />\nForce for all expenses incurred<br />\nin the construction of the facility.<br />\nIn addition to the laboratory, Barton Hall houses a number of faculty offices.<br />\nThe closing of the laboratory<br />\nwill not necessarily meanthe end<br />\nof the military's relationship to<br />\nBarton Hall. Under the original<br />\ncontract, the Department of Defense has priority over the use of<br />\nBarton Hall's space for the next<br />\ntwenty-two years. However, current reports indicate that it is unlikely that the Department of the<br />\nDefense will do anything involving<br />\nBarton Hall without the University's consent.<br />\nDr. Hamburger called the folding of the lab \"a loss to the country.\" He sees the lab shutdown as<br />\nalso hurting the University. According to Hamburger, the shutdown will mean a loss of income<br />\nfor some members of the electrical engineering department<br /><br />\nand a loss of support for graduate<br />\nstudents and faculty research.<br />\nThe Barton Lab has done work<br />\nin the area of \"electronic counter-measures.\" One military application of this work is preventing planes from being detected<br />\nby radar.<br />\nBesides electronic countermeasures, the laboratory carries<br />\non \"ferret reconaissance research\", which deals with new<br />\nways of picking up foreign transmissions.<br />\nThe laboratory has also worked on physical prOblems related to Air Force needs,- including infrared problems, laser<br />\nproblems, solid state devices<br />\nand high-frequency antennas.<br /><br />\nClassified Research<br />\nIn recent years, there has been<br />\na sharp decrease in the amount<br />\nof classified work being carried<br />\non by the laboratory. From August 1967 to September 1968, the<br />\nlab published 9 trade reports, 2<br />\nof which were classified, 10 internal memos, 3 of which were<br />\nclassified, and 4 quarterly reports, portions of all of which<br />\nwere classified.<br />\nAs little as ten years ago nearly<br />\n50% of the work done by the laboratory was classified.<br />\nThe lab held contracts with the<br />\nAir Force for about $1,000,000<br />\nper year in its early years.In the<br />\nearly sixties contracts were reduced to approximately $900,000<br />\nper year.<br />\nThe size of the contracts remained stable until 1967 when it<br />\nfell from $909,000 to $700,000.<br />\nThe present contract, due to expire in March of 1971, will not<br />\nbe completed as the lab will be<br />\nphased-out over the next six<br />\nmonths.<br />\nDr. Hamburger has been associated with the Barton Lab<br />\nsince its inception in 1954. In<br />\n1956, he took over as acting<br />\ndirector, and as the search for<br />\na director proved fruitless, he<br /><br />\nvolunteered and was appointed<br />\nthe new director. The laboratory<br />\nhas continued under his aegis<br />\nuntil the present time<br />\nThe Barton Laboratory had its<br />\nbeginnings at 1315 St. Paul Street.<br />\nIn 1962 the laboratory moved to<br />\nits present site in Barton Hall.<br />\nDr. Hamburger did research<br />\nhimself in the laboratory's early<br />\ndays. However, since takingover<br />\nas director, he has had little<br />\ntime for research. He now supervises the research being carried<br />\non in the laboratory.<br />\nThree faculty members spend<br />\nabout 80% of their time doing<br />\nresearch at the laboratory. About<br />\ntwenty graduate students are connected with the laboratory.<br /><br />\nThe Carlyle Barton laboratory now does more than SI million of research for<br />\nthe Air Force in the fields of electronics and electrical engineering. Lab director Dr. Ferdinand Hamburger termed the shut-down of the facilities\"a loss<br />\nto the country.\"<br /><br />\nSit-In Organizers Claim Victory<br />\nBy ANDY GREEN<br />\nWhile awaiting a hearing on charges of disorder ly conduct and disturbing the peace,leaders of last<br />\nThursday's anti-draft sit-in at the Customs House<br />\ncalled the demonstration a victory for the local<br />\nanti-war movement.<br />\nLawyers for the forty-one people who were<br />\narrested at the Custom House had no trouble Friday in obtaining a postponement of the hearing<br />\nuntil April 7th. Those arrested had been released<br />\nwithout bail Thursday night from Southeastern<br />\nPolice Station. \"The leniency of the police and<br />\nthe court,\" stated Chris Ohly, a sit-in organizer,<br />\n\"shows that the legal system was made for white<br />\nmiddle class folks like us.\"<br /><br />\nSo Committed<br />\nOhly, Larry Goldberg, and David Charry,leaders of the Hopkins Peace Action Committee and<br />\nco-organizers of the sit-in, all felt that the demonstrators had accomplished what they set out<br />\nto do. Commented Charry,\"Our sit-in demonstrated that there were people so committed to end<br />\nthe war that they were willing to go further than<br />\nmarching, that they were even w illing to be arrested.<br />\nGoldberg claimed that the sit-in had also ham-<br /><br />\npered the activities of the draft boards housed<br />\nin the Customs House. He cited reports that the<br />\nnumber of people who entered the board Thursday<br />\nwas far below average.<br /><br />\nCorrupt System<br />\nThe three leaders contended that Assistant U.S.<br />\nAttorney Alan Barron's refusal to let them enter<br />\nthe Customs House demonstrated the corrupt<br />\nnature of \"the system.\" \"There is something<br />\nwrong with the Government being afraid of us<br />\nbecause we were confronting them with a moral<br />\nissue,\" asserted Goldberg. Agreeing with Goldberg, Charry stated, \"When people are afraid<br />\nof ideas, it shows that there is something wrong<br />\nwith their system.\"<br />\n\"Barron was violating those very laws that he<br />\nwas supposedly hired to protect,\" said Ohly.<br />\nThe group's lawyers are planning to enter a<br />\nplea of not guilty at the April 7th hearing. Ohly<br />\nfelt that a vindication of the protest action by<br />\nthe court would encourage more people to join<br />\nsimilar demonstrations against war taxes on<br />\nApril 15. The defendants are planning to meet<br />\nwith their lawyers next week to plan court strategy.<br />\nThe Peace Action Committee plans to follow up<br />\nthe sit-in action with a disruption of Sikorsky<br />\nAircraft's recruiting on campus tomorrow.Sikorsky makes helicopters that are used in Vietnam.<br /><br />\nAFL-CIO Panel Finds 1199-E Guilty of Slander<br />\nIn two successive decisions by impartial AFL-CIO<br />\numpires, Nursing Home and Hospital Employees Union<br />\nLocal 1199E has been found guilty of making slanderous<br />\nattacks on Laborers' International Union Locals 1231 and<br />\n1273.<br />\nOne of the decisions came in early December, just two<br />\ndays before a scheduled election-with only 1231 on the<br />\nballot was postponed by a Federal District Court injunction. The court acted on a suit prepared by Local 1199E:<br />\nThe other was handed down in March and centered on a<br />\ndrive by both unions to organize workers at Bon Secours<br />\nHospital.

For<br />\nothers it means a bleary-eyed 9 a.m.Abnormal Psychology class. Many don't<br />\neven make the connection--after all, they<br />\ndon't name buildings after living people,<br />\ndo they?<br />\nNot only is G. Wilson Shaffer alive and<br />\nwell, but, along with professorial duties,<br />\nhe is director of what is probably the best<br />\nuniversity psychological clinic in the<br />\ncountry. And not only is he the director,<br />\nbut he also started it and virtually single handedly built it up to its present status.<br />\nBut much of that work was done in his<br />\nspare time. Through most of those years<br />\n\u2022he also happened to be Dean of Homewood. Even that is only one aspect of Dr.<br />\nShaffer's remarkable 50-year association with Johns Hopkins.<br /><br />\nSuperman Shaffer<br />\nShaffer came to Hopkins in 1920 after<br />\ngraduating from Baltimore City College.<br />\nHe played class baseball, was vice -president of the freshman class, was on the<br />\ninterfraternity board (he was a member<br />\nof now-defunct Kappa Sigma), chairman of<br />\nthe frerthman dance committee, and a<br />\nmember of the musical club.<br />\nHe was an outstanding athlete, and<br />\ncombined dancing and gymnastics in an<br />\nact which observers say, even today,<br />\nhas never been surpassed. The 1924<br />\nHullabaloo states, in part: \"Shaf of the<br />\nShuffling Shoes,...whose performance<br />\nwas a feature on the program of the<br />\nconcerts of the Musical Club.It was after<br />\none of the concerts that a sweet young<br />\nthing asked if Shaf possessed a pair of<br />\nball-bearing hips. If you have ever seen<br /><br />\nhim dance, you may judge for yourself.\"<br />\nHis athletic ability was such that he<br />\nwas disqualified from varsity competition (he lost his amateur status as a<br />\nsophomore in high school), and, upon<br />\ngraduation he had offers from professional baseball, football and basketball<br />\nteams. He signed a baseball contract(reputedly with the N. Y.Giants)but a childhood finger injury hampered him and he<br />\ndecided to return to Hopkins for his Ph.D.<br />\nHis finest hour here, he says, was when<br />\nhe struck out 18 batters in a seven-inning fraternity game.<br />\nShaffer received his Ph.D in psychology in 1928. Besides teaching here,<br />\nhe joined the staff of Sheppard-Pratt Hospital, worked in the Student Health Service<br />\non campus,and wrote a textbook on abnormal psychologY. His involvement with<br />\nsports, however, was far from over.<br />\nImproves Sports<br />\nIn 1933 President Ames appointed a<br />\ncommittee to look into the sports program on campus, with a view to expanding intramurals and dropping football.<br />\nThe program was then run by an alumnidominated Athletic Association, and students had a choice between joining a team,<br />\nentering ROTC or taking'physical training.' \"Physical Training,\" Shaffer noted,<br />\n\"usually meant the assistant football<br />\ncoach meeting them on rare occasions<br />\nwith an overcoat on, going 1-2-3-4.\"<br />\nUnder Shaffer, the committee changed<br />\nthis. Football was not dropped, and five<br />\nnew sports were added. The one-year<br />\ngym requirement was added, but with<br />\nemphasis on sports rather than gymnastics. A gymnasium was built that cost<br />\n$30,000 and is still standing. Most important, however,the committee abolished the entrance fee to all sports events.<br /><br />\nThe free admissions policy, which finally fell this year, was revolutionary at<br />\nthe time and still almost unique even recently. For thirty years, Hopkins was<br />\nvirtually the only school where anyone<br />\ncould walk in and watch any sports event,<br />\neven national champion lacrosse games.<br />\n\"I can't help but be disappointed about<br />\nthe admissions charge,\" Shaffer stated.<br />\n\"What I tried to accomplish is no longer<br />\npossible. What the NCAA and the colleges<br />\nhave done to football, though,is terrible.<br />\nEveryone is watching the game of the week<br />\ninstead of watching their own kids play.<br />\nInstead of getting scholarships, the athletes should be getting real big salaries.<br />\nI think a distinction should be made between recreation and public amusement.\"<br /><br />\nStarts Clinic<br />\nIn 1936 Shaffer started the psychological clinic as a part of the Student Health<br />\nService, and staffed it himself. Due to the<br />\nstigma<br />\nsurrounding therapy, it grew<br />\nslowly; however, two part-time psychologists he hired to help him out soon quit<br />\nbecause of overwork. After the war,with<br />\nthe dramatic rise in the number of students on campus, he worked out an arrangement with the Phipps Clinic of the<br />\nHopkins Hospital to have a number of psychiatrists and first-year residents work<br />\npart-time at Homewood. This program<br />\nhas now expanded to include such work<br />\nas part of the residents' training.<br />\nMeantime, in 1942, Shaffer became<br />\nDean of Arts and Sciences, a post which<br />\nhad responsibility for all underclassmen and all non-engineering upperclassmen, as well as admissions (until 1945)<br />\nand alumni relations (until 1946). He<br />\nwas also, in effect, Dean of Students, a<br />\npost which was not created until 1951.<br />\nFerdinand Hamburger, Chairman of the<br />\nElectrical Engineering Department and<br /><br />\na long-time friend of Shaffer, said,\"Wilson and Stuart (Stuart McCauley, provost) ran this place by themselves pretty<br />\nmuch.\"<br />\nIn 1948 there was a reshuffling of administrative positions and Shaffer became Dean of the Homewood Schools,<br />\noverseeing the School of Engineering,<br />\nthe School of Arts and Sciences, and<br />\nthe Evening College. He held the position until 1967.<br />\nIncredible Feat<br />\nThroughout the past 34 years Shaffer<br />\nhas also remained Director of the Psychological Clinic, and from 1946 to 1967<br />\nhe maintained one office in Homewood<br />\nHouse and one in the White House. Although he claims \"it never made any'<br />\ndifference that I was director and Dean<br />\nat the same time,\" this feat is precise'<br />\nly what draws much praise from his<br />\nassociates.<br />\nDr. Lee Park, a psychiatrist at PhiPPs<br />\nClinic, said, \"The amazing thing about<br />\nhim is that he was able to establish his<br />\nintegrity with the students, so that the<br />\nfact that he was the administrative and<br />\ndisciplinary authority on campus had<br />\nno effect upon their coming to him with<br />\nproblems and confessions. People would<br />\neven tell him that they had stolen or<br />\ncheated.\"<br />\nPark terms Shaffer \"extremely forward-looking,\" and Osmar Steinwald,<br />\none of Shaffer's classmates and now Director of Alumnt, Relations, called his<br />\n\"revolutionary.\" He added,<br />\nClinic<br />\n\"There weren't many places a boy could<br />\nturn to back then. Many are still grateful for his guidance.\" Dr. Alsoph Corwin of Chemistry remarked, \"I doubt if<br />\ntwo or three universities in the country<br />\nhave men of comparable ability to clothe<br />\njob.\"<br /><br />\nStudents Charge New Ad Hoc Committee Undermines SAC<br />\nBy HOWARD LEVENSON<br />\nCertain students have sharply attacked President Gordon's<br />\nAd Hoc Committee on development of a temporary student union for Homewood.<br />\nThey charge that it was deliberately established to undermine<br />\nthe Student Affairs Committee,<br />\nand that the chairman of the new<br />\ncommittee hasn't adequately consulted with students.<br />\nThe Ad Hoc Committee favors<br />\nShriver Hall for an interim facility.<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee<br />\nhas already set up a sub-committee to look into the problem of a<br />\npermanent facility. Subcommittee<br />\nchairman Chris Ohly thinks that<br />\npower considerations were behind Gordon's decision to have<br />\nDr. William Bevan, the UniverProvost, set up a second<br />\nsity<br />\ncommittee.<br /><br />\nSAC Weakened?<br />\nOhly says, \"I have a feeling<br />\nthat Gordon doesn't want to give<br />\nup his power to the SAC.His overall policy is to undermine the<br />\ninfluence of the subcommittees<br />\nwhich he sets up. An ad hoc committee can be set up or dissolved<br />\nas he pleases. If he is unpleas-<br /><br />\ned, he can take all the credit.\"<br />\nRichard Cramer, an undergraduate member of the Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee, agrees that power<br />\nwas improperly removed from<br />\nthe SAC,the first group to become<br />\ninvolved in the issue. Cramer<br />\nfeels that Dr. Bevan took the matter out of the SAC's hands \"apparently because they did too<br />\ngood a job.\"<br />\nThe decision-making processes of Ad Hoc Committee Chairman John McElwee, Director of<br />\nPlant Planning, were also questioned.<br />\nIn a preliminary report dated<br />\nFebruary 20, McElwee said his<br />\nviews on a student union came<br />\nafter \"extensive canvassing of<br />\nstudent groups, and \"many hours,<br />\nof deliberations among the students, faculty, and the administration.\"<br /><br />\nIII-Advised<br />\nCramer, however,commenting<br />\non the report, said that the committee had met only once before<br />\nMcElwee's distribution of the<br />\nreport. \"McElwee asked me a<br />\nfew very general questions. I<br />\ngave him very general answers.<br />\nHe came out with very specific,<br />\nill-advised proposals--and ab-<br /><br />\nsurd space allocations.\"<br />\nCramer's specific criticisms<br />\nof the McElwee report center on<br />\nhis feeling that they over-emphasize<br />\nfacilities for large<br />\ngroups, rather than reflecting the<br />\nindividual-orientation of the Hopkins campus.<br />\nAt a second meeting of the Ad<br /><br />\nHoc Committee on March 13,<br />\nMcElwee made plans for cooperating with the SAC subcommittee. The critics, though, still<br />\nask why two committees say that<br />\nthe SAC subcommittee will benefit from McElwee's technical expertise, and that he in turn will<br />\ngain from the SAC's closeness<br /><br />\nto students.<br />\nalternate<br />\nWhile presenting<br />\nplans for the renovation of Shriver Hall or Whitehead Hall, McElwee emphasized the advantages<br />\nof Shriver as a temporary student union.

The bill, aimed at correcting these loop:<br />\nholes, has encountered the studied, even ferocious opposition_ of the phone company in the legislature. Instead<br />\nof welcoming public interest in correcting abuses within<br />\ntheir organizatior. the phone company, through its public<br />\nrelations spokesman, asserted, \"I think that we're all very<br />\nfortunate that Steve Blumenthal is no longer with the<br />\ntelephone company.\"<br />\nWithout Blumenthal, though, we would never have<br />\nknown (or thought about) how easily our phones can be<br />\nand sometimes are monitored. Yet it is not the present<br />\nmisuse of telephone equipment that is so shocking, but<br />\nthe potentialities for much more threatening abuses such<br />\nas blackmail, political spying or organized crime operations. Presently there are no specific public regulations<br />\nthat would prohibit such activities.<br />\nWhen the News-Letter first began acquiring information for the phone company story, we checked with the<br />\nTest Center's management for some facts about their<br />\nequipment. Their response was total paranoia; only a<br />\nsecurity officer could speak and he accused the N-L reporter of being a member of the SDS\u2014because the reporter<br />\n. asked the age of the machinery in the 31st Street Building.<br />\nIf the phone bill does pass the state legislature, it will<br />\nbe a big step in channeling public outrage into a constructive law intended to improve our quickly vanishing privacy.<br />\nSenator Julian Lapides, the bill's sponsor, should be complimented for his immediate interest and quick action in<br />\nthis issue, as well as the students, especially Blumenthal,<br />\nwho had the guts to expose the misuse of telephone equipment.<br />\nAnd finally, the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone<br />\nshould be condemned for its pressure politics and flagrant<br />\ndisregard for the public interest.

I would offer<br />\nhim some questions:<br />\n1) Does your conscience bother you when<br />\nyou remember that APL satellites guide<br />\nbombers to murder and mutilate Vietnamese babies?<br />\n2) Does your conscience bother you when<br />\nyou read that the junta you installed in<br />\nBrazil in 1964, the junta you praised so<br />\neffusively, is stepping up the torture of<br />\npolitical prisoners? Perhaps the unhinder ed flow of Hanna Mining Co. profits back<br />\nto your friends in the states softens your<br />\ntwinges of guilt?<br />\n3) Does it bother your conscience that<br />\nAPL prostitutes science in the same way<br />\nyou prostituted your office in Brazil?<br />\n4) How much of a part did McCloy, friend<br />\nof Krupp, I. G.

The<br />\nmoral issue of this University's complicity in<br />\nplanning and carrying out the criminal war against<br />\nVietnam is starkly clear,whether you can see it or<br />\nnot. You have time and time again said that neither<br />\nyou nor the University give a shit for morality.<br />\nThe name of the game at Hopkins is money and<br />\npower. The Trustees' money has bought for them<br />\nthe power of directing this University's priorities,<br />\nand it is this power that those of us who would keep<br />\nfaith with our consciences must confront. We don't<br />\nneed some liberal committee's bullshit proposals.<br />\nIf we are to keep any shred of morality, we must<br />\naccept only one thing from the Trustees, and that<br />\nis an end to the prostitution of APL.<br />\nMarion Jango Delgado<br /><br />\nON OLANDER<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWe believe this article \"On Women's Lib\" by<br />\nChristopher Olander; N-L, March 17 grossly<br />\nmisrepresents the Women's Liberation Movement<br />\nas it exists today. Its most obvious fault is its<br />\nblatant distortion of fact. Citing two individual<br />\npassages, in two individual articles, by two individual women in a movement numbering well into<br />\nthe thousands, Mr.Olander generalizes from them<br />\nthat \"Most of the spokeswomen for the 'movement' demand what amounts to abstinence,\" and<br />\nthat \"Women's Lib. believes love to be outmoded<br />\nand useless.' Quite clearly no attempt was made<br />\nto present the spectrum of opinion, present as it<br />\nis in any political movement,among Women's Liberation groups. No attempt was made to contact<br />\nBaltimore Women's Liberation groups or read<br />\nthe magazine put out by members of these Baltimore groups, WOMEN: A JOURNAL OF LIBERATION (circulation of which, by the way,triples that<br />\nof No More Fun and Games.) As is so often done<br />\nby the establishment press, the article exploits<br />\nthe novelty of Women's Liberation and its feminist<br />\napproach and makes it an object of ridicule,rather<br />\nthan attempting to get into the issues at hand.<br />\nThe author does show some insight into the problems of women as he quotes and accepts the ideas<br />\nof Simone de Beauvoir; but then, in real ignorance<br />\nof what Women's Liberation is about, these ideas<br />\nare superficially rejected as irrelevent to the<br />\nMovement. What is most offensive about the article,<br />\nthen, is its total insensitivity to the kind of oppression women feel, not simply on the job or in the<br />\nhome, but on a perpetual gut level of our sexuality<br />\nAlthough we reject abstinence and masturbation as<br />\nsolutions to the problem of women's oppression,we<br /><br />\nTHE Minlisr-R(oF<br />\nINToRioR<br />\n0<br /><br />\nus vt/ si-looLp<br />\nSi-lcor FOR A<br />\nZEFW &amp;1\nRAT!<br /><br />\n\u2022Field Enterprises, In, 1910<br /><br />\nMarch 24, 1970<br /><br />\nrTh<br /><br />\nacknowledge the same frustration expressed by our<br />\nsisters in the traditional feminine role. The passive, deferential, sexually objective and essentially maternal roles women have been conditioned to<br />\nplay in all aspects of our lives we challange as<br />\nuntrue to our humanity. Accordingly, we feel we<br />\nmust first re-examine all areas of our lives and<br />\nthen, with hightened consciousness, demand an end<br />\nto this automatic playing of roles.<br />\nRegarding sexual relationships, with which the<br />\narticle seems especially concerned, we do refuse<br />\nto tolerate being used as a sex object for the gratification of men with no regard for ourselves as<br />\npeople. This may seem to indicate we simply reject our traditional passive role in sexual relationships and let our repressed \"natural desire<br />\nand behavior\" come forth. Sexually free women,<br />\nhowever, can also be used in sex objects--witness the example of prostitutes or of the Playboy mentality. What we are callingfor,then, is an<br />\nhonest re-appraisal of our sexual relationships,<br />\na re -appraisal which demands that we<br />\nno longer<br />\nbe treated as objects in any way. This does not,<br />\nhowever, imply sexual abstinence; what it does<br />\nImply is the creation of relationships based on<br />\nmutual respect and love.<br />\nPolitically, also Women's Liberation does not<br />\nImply \"the removal of men from positions of<br />\npower<br />\nand their replacement with women.\" What we do<br />\ndesire, however, is the creation of a political<br />\norder that puts the needs of the people before<br />\nmanipulated needs, that, for women,.allows us the<br />\nfreedom to make those choices which effect our<br />\nlives, choices about birth control, abortion, child<br />\ncare, etc.<br />\nIn its final analysis Women's Liberation, in its<br />\nchallange of feminine roles, does imply a concommitant male liberation--a human liberation.<br />\nSurely<br />\nmen too are prevented from developing<br />\ntheir<br />\nhuman potential by the role channeling<br />\nthey experience in contemporary society. As we see<br />\nit<br />\nthen, Women's Liberation is workingfor the<br />\ncreation of a society that allows all people, men<br />\nand<br />\nwomen, to fulfill their human needs.<br />\n10 members ofBaltimore Women's LiberationWed a. m. discussion group<br /><br />\nCUSTOMS HOUSE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn Thursday afternoon, March 19, we, along<br />\nwith 39 friends, attempted to enter the Custom<br />\nHouse in order to discuss with local draft board<br />\nclerks and other officials of the Selective Service<br />\nSystem matters of concern to us.

Doug Honig and Stu Kahl led the Blue Jay scoring with two goals apiivce, rionig with an assist also to his<br />\ncredit. Other goal producers for Hopkins were Bill Donovan, Doug Fuchs, Danny Hall, and Gary Handleman.<br />\nThe overall team defense was very strong, allowing<br />\nonly one goal when at full strength, this occurring late<br />\nin the fourth quarter. Notable play was turned in by all<br />\nthree front line defensemen. Bob MacCool and Ex Pack<br />\nplayer all American Paul Weiss completely shut-off Yale's'<br />\nattackmen when they tried to go one-on-one near the<br />\ncrease, and sophomore Joe Cieslowski showed exceptional speed in his clearing rushes upheld.<br />\nGoalie Ken Dauses played an exceptional game. Dauses<br />\nhas good moves and clears quickly and accurately upfield.<br />\nIt's almost like a fast break pass in basketball. Dauses<br /><br />\nhad 14 saves, and allowed two of the three goals. Second<br />\nstring goalie Pete Conti permitted the third Yale tally.<br /><br />\nMiddies Potent<br />\nOffensively, the team played sloppily at times,and well<br />\nin spurts through the four periods. The middies were a<br />\nmore potent group than the attackmen, scoring five of the<br />\neight Hopkins goals. Although Mid-fielder Charlie Coker<br />\ndid not score,(he had one assist)he is the man who moves<br />\nthe offense. He took one backhand \"Shovel\" shot from<br />\nabout 40 feet which was incredible. It hit the goal post.<br />\nSophomore Gary Handleman scored his first varsity<br />\ngoal against Yale and should prove to be a strong contributor to the Blue Jay's offense.<br />\nYale tallied first in the game on a goal by Tom Fagan<br />\nwith Hopkins shy three men. Hopkins took the lead after<br />\nan unassisted goal by Bill Donovanw hen Doug Fuchs scooped up a loose ball in front of the Yale goal and put it in<br />\nthe net. Fagan then scored his second goal of the game<br />\nwith Hopkins shorthanded once again. However, from that<br /><br />\npoint on, it was all Hopkins as the Blue Jays netted five<br />\nconsecutive goals.<br />\nOverall, the team took 44 shots on goal as oppossed<br />\nto 25 by Yale.The Blue Jays outhustled and outplayed Yale<br />\nfor most of the game.They also showed themselves to be a<br />\ntough physical unit.<br />\nYale was considered a strOng opponent. It had tied for<br />\nthe Ivy title last year and had given both the Long Island<br />\nlacrosse club, the top lacross club of last year, and the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia, a contender for the national championship, close scrimmages earlier this season.<br />\nAlthough the coaching staff would like to see more goals<br />\nscored, and crisper overall offensive play, there is a<br />\nfeeling that this will come with time, as the mid-fielders<br />\nand attackmen learn to play more cohesively with each<br />\nother.<br />\nCoach Scott though, cannot help smiling at the thought<br />\nof the play of his defense and goalie.It was as good, if not<br />\nbetter, than he had expected for the first game of the season.<br /><br />\n4t.<br />\nZrOlt1<br />\n4M,t.:<br /><br />\n7.<br />\n4t<br /><br />\n\u2022 1214\"'' \"itaCiejkitti<br />\n,<br />\n(414461111..\"41r.<br /><br />\nHopkins stickmen battle for a loose ball around the home team's cage while goalie Ken<br />\nDauses looks on.

PETER<br />\nLate last spring Coach Gary Barrett submitted his resignation<br />\nfrom the Coaches' staff here at Hopkins. It is unfortunate that he<br />\npostponed his decision so late into the season.The repercussions are<br />\nnow being felt by the Athletic Office.<br />\nBecause the resignation came so late in the season, there was no<br />\ntime available to screen applicants and select a full-time varsity<br />\nsoccer and baseball coach to replace Barrett. Marshall Turner.<br />\nDirector of Athletics here at Hopkins,was forced to rely on part-time<br />\ncoaches for baseball and soccer. It isn't a question of ability on the<br />\npart of the coaches, but one of the importance of having a full-time<br />\ncoach in these sports.<br />\nA part-time coach is in a very unfortunate position. He is expected to come up with a good ballclub if the talent is there, yet is unable<br />\nto perform any other of the duties of head coach, other than running<br />\ndaily practice.<br />\nThere is much more to running a ballclub than simply calling practices and picking starters. The part-time coach cannot spend any<br />\ntime a tall developing younger ballplayers who must later take over<br />\nfor graduating seniors. A part-time coach has no time at all to devote<br />\nin recruiting scholar-athletes, and this hurts the clubs as well.<br />\nA coach must be in a position to formulate and develop long range<br />\nplans for his club, as well as run the club on a game-to-game basis.<br />\nIn short, a part-time coach, regardless of how dedicated he might be,<br />\ncannot perform all the duties required of a college varsity coach.<br />\nWhat has happened with Mr. Turner havingtoo little time to secure<br />\nanother coach is that he was forced to enter into his budget the<br />\nsalaries of his two part-time coaches, rather than the single fulltime salary. This is of course cheaper, but in no way beneficial to the<br />\nAthletic program here.<br />\nWith the University experiencing a budgetary crisis, orders from<br />\nthe top requiring all vacancies in the various departments to remain<br />\nthat way, and all staff positions to remain unchanged, the Athletic<br />\nCenter is now in an unfortunate position.<br />\nFirst, these policy changes forbid Mr. Turner from finding a fulltime coach to fill Mr.Barrett's vacancy.Second,the prospects of Mr.<br />\n, Turner being given permission to do so in the near future are bleak.<br />\nThe permission could not come until the extra money for a fulltime<br />\nsalary was re-granted to the Athletic Center's budget.<br />\nI think that Mr. Turner should be allowed to find a coach to fill<br />\nBarrett's vacancy, since the position opened up before the order<br />\ncame down to leave positions open. It is unfair to take away from<br />\nthe Hopkins' Athletic Program something as vital as a full-time coach<br />\nfor two varsity sports. It is my opinion that Hopkins' athletics is<br />\n\"taking it on the chin.\" This is not even a question of asking for<br />\nanother coach, but simply asking for a replacement. I can see no<br />\njustification in holding up the hiring of a new coach.<br /><br />\nBaseball Gets Lost In the Shuffle<br />\nBy CHARLEY POOLE<br />\nYes, Virginia, the Hop does<br />\nhave a baseball team.
