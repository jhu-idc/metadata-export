The team played<br />\nin a dilly-dally fashion and save for<br />\nthe good work of Stevenson, Morton and Gillet on the ends it is hard<br />\nto pick any very brilliant linemen.<br />\nPlaying under orders from the<br />\ncoaches there was a great deal of<br />\npunting and the way in which the<br />\nends got down the field under the<br />\nkicks was most encouraging. The<br />\ntackling generally was the best we<br />\nhave seen this year.<br />\nIn the back field Stollenwerck was<br />\nParticularly prominent, and his running back kicks was a feature of the<br />\ngame. Mills was a consistent gainer of ground through the line, while<br />\nMcCabe, who played half back was<br />\na tower of strength in the defence.<br />\nIt is a pity that Paulus is not heavier, for if he had a few more pounds<br />\nhe would make some of the regulars<br />\nhustle to hold down their jobs. During the few moments they played<br />\nBridgman and Fulton proved their<br />\nalready well known ability.<br />\nThe first half opened with a series<br />\nof fumbles that finally placed Gallaudet in a position to kick a goal<br />\nfrom placement their only score.<br />\nThe rest of the half was a kicking<br />\ncontest and thanks to ground gained<br />\nby Michael's better booting and line<br />\nplunges we scored two touchdowns.<br />\n\u20140\u2014<br />\nConcluded in column 2.<br />\n<br />\nNovember 15, 1909.<br />\n''HOPKINS NIGHT\"<br />\n\u20140\u2014<br />\nFirst \"Hopkins Night,\" November 2o\u2014Crowd Expected.<br />\nThe first benefit night held by the<br />\n\"Hullabaloo\" board will be at Ford's<br />\nTheatre, Saturday, November 20, the<br />\nnight of the St. John's game.

Saturday is the<br />\nday that Hopkins men believe will<br />\ngo down in our football history in<br />\ngreat, big, red, capital letters, for on<br />\nnext Saturday the St. Johns game is<br />\nto be played, and everyone has a<br />\npretty strong \"hunch\" that our team<br />\nis going to square some old scores.<br />\nThe confidence that the undergraduates place in Captain McCabe's<br />\neleven is far from unfounded. Never<br />\nbefore has there been such a wealth<br />\nof material for the coaches to select<br />\nfrom, and if need be we can play<br />\ntwo teams in the game and finish with<br />\npractically as strong a combination as<br />\nwas sent in as the first string. Never<br />\nbefore have we had such a heavy team<br />\nthat withal is so speedy. Never before have we had a team that showed more true football spirit, or was so<br />\nimbued with the never-say-die idea.<br />\nNever before have we enjoyed the<br />\nadvantage of Mr. Gill's coaching,<br />\nNever before have we had such alumni backing and such undergraduate<br />\nenthusiasm. The team was slow in<br />\ndeveloping, but it has rounded into<br />\nas perfect a football machine as ever<br />\nwore the black and blue. The victory<br />\nfrom Western Maryland showed the<br />\nspirit that wins lost games, the fame<br />\nagainst Dickinson demonstrated high<br />\nability to handle an open game, \u2014St.<br />\nJohn's favorite play\u2014and next Saturday will come the climax of a most<br />\nsuccessful season.<br />\nThere is no use to recount the \"St.<br />\nJohn's' hoodoo\" and to tell how, more<br />\nthan once, they have beaten a better<br />\nteam, thanks to better luck. It seems<br />\nthis year that we can give them all<br />\nluck and still take them into camp.<br />\nAt least so think the coaches, and the<br />\nteam shares their confidence, while<br />\nthose \"On the Side of the Line\" are<br />\ncertainly expecting to see \"their heroes shine.\"<br />\nOur team is fit as a fiddle, and is<br />\ngoing to put up the game of its season next Saturday.

We<br />\nwere led to .expect a game full of<br />\nforward passes, on-side kicks, and<br />\ntricks, and we were not disappointed.<br />\nThis is the kind of a game that we<br />\nhear St. John's relies upon, and the<br />\neffective way in which.. such tactics<br />\nwere foiled certainly \"looked good\"<br />\nto our rooters. The line from end to<br />\nend showed itself to be improving<br />\ncontinually, while the back-field demonstrated anew its ground-gaining<br />\nability.<br />\nThe shifting of Stevenson to end<br />\nseems to have found a most useful position for the ex-Yale player, and he<br />\nand Musser are a pair of wings that<br />\ncan well be relied upon. Of the linemen, Michael won everlasting fame<br />\nby his \"seventy yard walk,\" and<br />\nthroughout played a star game. Stollenwerck ran the team with rare good<br />\njudgment and gained plenty of ground<br />\nwhen he carried the ball. Bridgman<br />\nwas the brightest star of the backs,<br />\nthough both Mills and Fulton gained<br />\nconsistently when called upon.<br />\nAll of the scoring was done in the<br />\nfirst half \u2014 Dickinson making two<br />\ntouchdowns, thanks quite as much to<br />\nHopkins' fumbles as their own good<br />\nplaying, and \"Babe\" literally walking seventy yards with a ball he found<br />\nsomewhere, nobody knows just where.<br />\nThe second hal was slightly in Hopkins' favor. Fumbles, however, prevented our scoring. Toward the end<br />\nof the game Dickinson showed a little disposition to \"mess things up,\"<br />\n.and they certainly took their own<br />\nsweet time as the half drew towarn<br />\na close, probably feeling that a victory saved by the final whistle was<br />\nbetter than a tied score.<br />\nContinued on page 2.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nThe News-Letter<br />\nr---Vol. XIV.

Woods,<br />\n'to, because of pressure of studies.<br />\nMr. Woods has been a member of<br />\nthe staff for the last two years, and<br />\nwe trust that, as far as time will permit, he will continue his contributions<br />\nto our columns.<br />\nWe publish in another column a<br />\nletter just received from an alumnus,<br />\nconcerning the welfare of the NewsLena. As to alumni interest in the<br />\npaper, it has been pointed out that,<br />\nunlike other colleges, Johns Hopkins<br />\nmaintains no alumni publication, although the project has been several<br />\ntimes seriously considered. In absence of any such publication, and,<br />\nalso, considering the number which<br />\nour in-town alumni have now reached, it is believed that the News-Letter<br />\nmay at least receive a trial to fill the<br />\ndeficiency. An alumni circulation of<br />\nseveral hundred among the city, and<br />\neven at a distance also, would accomp'ish two things: (1) Those alumni<br />\nwho are intersted in the University<br />\nt:ctivities would be continually posted<br />\nevery week as to events about to take<br />\nplace here\u2014an information more reliable than that gained from rumor.<br />\n(2) Alumni may always find in the<br />\nNews-Letter a vehicle for expression of opinion as to questions concerning those University affairs which<br />\nfrom time to time arise for discussion. The alumnus may find<br />\nthrough the News-Letter columns the<br />\naudience to which he wishes to appeal.<br />\nConsidering, then, that the NewsLetter can readily be of service in<br />\nthese two directions, the Board is this<br />\nyear attempting to form a large<br />\nalumni subscription list. The suggestions and attitude of several members of the Alumni Council have been<br />\nso encouraging that it has been<br />\nthought reasonable to make the attempt.<br />\n<br />\nThe time for the annual University debate is fast approaching, and<br />\nif the call for candidates has not already been issued, the trumpet will<br />\nsurely be heard to sound before long.<br />\nThe debate committee has been appointed, and arrangements are being<br />\nmade for the conflict. The University<br />\nteam will lose several men by graduation, and it is hoped that new candidates will appear from all the<br />\nclasses at the University. Freshmen<br />\nrarely make the University team, but,<br />\njust as the \"scrubs\" in football are of<br />\nthe greatest service, the freshmen in<br />\ndebate, too, always form good material for practice for the older candidates. It is to be hoped, then, that<br />\na large crop of debaters will report<br />\nwhen the. call is issued.<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter,<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University:<br />\nAlumni of the late nineties will<br />\nremember that the News-Letter was<br />\nfirst conducted as an experiment, and<br />\nthat it did not receive final sanction<br />\nfrom the Trustees until it had proved<br />\nitself harmless. Since that time until<br />\nthe present year the paper has been<br />\na fortnightly periodical, and successive boards of editors have struggled<br />\nwith the problem of giving it a definite character. It has been a belated<br />\nnewspaper, a hasty and slender literary magazine, and ineffecti.ye comic<br />\njournal; but it has never, I think,<br />\nsucceeded in being distinctively one<br />\nthing or the other. The present board<br />\nof editors is to be commended for<br />\nits solution of the problem. The NewsLetter as a thorough-going college<br />\nnewspaper is at least consistent with<br />\nits name and dominated by a consistent purpose.<br />\nThis change in the form and purpose of the paper is so great as to<br />\nmake it practically a new venture. If<br />\nit is to succeed and grow into the<br />\nplace that exists for it in Hopkins<br />\nlife, it must be supported, first of<br />\nall, by the students. The editors<br />\ncount upon such support and they will<br />\ndoubtless receive it. But there are<br />\ntwo other classes whose good opinion<br />\nthe paper needs and whose approval<br />\nthe editors may, through a natural<br />\ndelicacy, hesitate to ask for boldly.<br />\nI mean the faculty and the alumni.<br />\nIn past years some members of the<br />\nfaculty have frankly and consistently<br />\ndisapproved of the News-Letter.<br />\nThemselves editors of or contributors<br />\nto learned journals that carry the<br />\nfame of Johns Hopkins abroad, they<br />\nwinced at the amateurishness of the<br />\nstudent journal and cried out against<br />\nthe youthful slips in proofreading that<br />\nmarred its pages. Such persons<br />\nshould be mollified by the change to<br />\na weekly. A newspaper may be pardoned some marks of haste. A college newspaper may show signs of<br />\nunpracticed, or even careless, hands<br />\nwithout disgracing us abroad or at<br />\nhome.<br />\nOther members of the faculty have<br />\npaid for the News-Letter and have<br />\nnever given it a further thought. The<br />\nproof-reading didn't trouble them, for<br />\n<br />\nthey never saw it; unless some specially egregious blunder was brought<br />\nto their notice. Members of the faculty who have been indifferent to the<br />\nNews-Letter may perhaps find in the<br />\nfuture that as a student transcript of<br />\nwhat is going on and a useful forecast of what is about to come it is<br />\nworthy of a passing glance.<br />\nThe other class, the alumni, have<br />\nhitherto taken no interest whatever<br />\nin the paper. This is not surprising,<br />\nfor until a year or two ago the great<br />\nmajority of the alumni seemed little<br />\ninterested in anything that their successors in the University were doing.<br />\nThe notable awakening of the alumni<br />\nthat has taken place in the last two<br />\nyears, particularly the formation of<br />\nthe Alumni Council, changes all this.<br />\nThe News-Letter stands ready to<br />\nserve as organ for the new movement<br />\namong Hopkins alumni. Its columns<br />\nare open for their announcements; its<br />\neditors welcome alumni news. They<br />\ndeserve and should receive alumni<br />\nsubscriptions and alumni interest.<br />\nJ. C.

The team played<br />\nin a dilly-dally fashion and save for<br />\nthe good work of Stevenson, Morton and Gillet on the ends it is hard<br />\nto pick any very brilliant linemen.<br />\nPlaying under orders from the<br />\ncoaches there was a great deal of<br />\npunting and the way in which the<br />\nends got down the field under the<br />\nkicks was most encouraging. The<br />\ntackling generally was the best we<br />\nhave seen this year.<br />\nIn the back field Stollenwerck was<br />\nParticularly prominent, and his running back kicks was a feature of the<br />\ngame. Mills was a consistent gainer of ground through the line, while<br />\nMcCabe, who played half back was<br />\na tower of strength in the defence.<br />\nIt is a pity that Paulus is not heavier, for if he had a few more pounds<br />\nhe would make some of the regulars<br />\nhustle to hold down their jobs. During the few moments they played<br />\nBridgman and Fulton proved their<br />\nalready well known ability.<br />\nThe first half opened with a series<br />\nof fumbles that finally placed Gallaudet in a position to kick a goal<br />\nfrom placement their only score.<br />\nThe rest of the half was a kicking<br />\ncontest and thanks to ground gained<br />\nby Michael's better booting and line<br />\nplunges we scored two touchdowns.<br />\n\u20140\u2014<br />\nConcluded in column 2.<br /><br />\nNovember 15, 1909.<br />\n''HOPKINS NIGHT\"<br />\n\u20140\u2014<br />\nFirst \"Hopkins Night,\" November 2o\u2014Crowd Expected.<br />\nThe first benefit night held by the<br />\n\"Hullabaloo\" board will be at Ford's<br />\nTheatre, Saturday, November 20, the<br />\nnight of the St. John's game.

The St. John's<br />\ngame will be over, and everyone will<br />\nbe feeling flush, in the finest kind of<br />\nmood, ready either to applaud the<br />\nheroine or hiss the villain. St. John's<br />\nwill probably occupy a large part of<br />\nthe theatre, and it is \"up to us\" to<br />\nfill the \"better half.\" This is an occasion when the undergaduates should<br />\ncome out \"en masse ;\" Hopkins spirit<br />\nshould be at its high-water mark;<br />\nandl neither breaking of training nor<br />\nBacchanalian feasts should prevent<br />\nApropos<br />\nanyone from attending.<br />\nhere are a few words to the freshmen who have never witnessed a<br />\nHopkins night.

Saturday is the<br />\nday that Hopkins men believe will<br />\ngo down in our football history in<br />\ngreat, big, red, capital letters, for on<br />\nnext Saturday the St. Johns game is<br />\nto be played, and everyone has a<br />\npretty strong \"hunch\" that our team<br />\nis going to square some old scores.<br />\nThe confidence that the undergraduates place in Captain McCabe's<br />\neleven is far from unfounded. Never<br />\nbefore has there been such a wealth<br />\nof material for the coaches to select<br />\nfrom, and if need be we can play<br />\ntwo teams in the game and finish with<br />\npractically as strong a combination as<br />\nwas sent in as the first string. Never<br />\nbefore have we had such a heavy team<br />\nthat withal is so speedy. Never before have we had a team that showed more true football spirit, or was so<br />\nimbued with the never-say-die idea.<br />\nNever before have we enjoyed the<br />\nadvantage of Mr. Gill's coaching,<br />\nNever before have we had such alumni backing and such undergraduate<br />\nenthusiasm. The team was slow in<br />\ndeveloping, but it has rounded into<br />\nas perfect a football machine as ever<br />\nwore the black and blue. The victory<br />\nfrom Western Maryland showed the<br />\nspirit that wins lost games, the fame<br />\nagainst Dickinson demonstrated high<br />\nability to handle an open game, \u2014St.<br />\nJohn's favorite play\u2014and next Saturday will come the climax of a most<br />\nsuccessful season.<br />\nThere is no use to recount the \"St.<br />\nJohn's' hoodoo\" and to tell how, more<br />\nthan once, they have beaten a better<br />\nteam, thanks to better luck. It seems<br />\nthis year that we can give them all<br />\nluck and still take them into camp.<br />\nAt least so think the coaches, and the<br />\nteam shares their confidence, while<br />\nthose \"On the Side of the Line\" are<br />\ncertainly expecting to see \"their heroes shine.\"<br />\nOur team is fit as a fiddle, and is<br />\ngoing to put up the game of its season next Saturday.

We<br />\nwere led to .expect a game full of<br />\nforward passes, on-side kicks, and<br />\ntricks, and we were not disappointed.<br />\nThis is the kind of a game that we<br />\nhear St. John's relies upon, and the<br />\neffective way in which.. such tactics<br />\nwere foiled certainly \"looked good\"<br />\nto our rooters. The line from end to<br />\nend showed itself to be improving<br />\ncontinually, while the back-field demonstrated anew its ground-gaining<br />\nability.<br />\nThe shifting of Stevenson to end<br />\nseems to have found a most useful position for the ex-Yale player, and he<br />\nand Musser are a pair of wings that<br />\ncan well be relied upon. Of the linemen, Michael won everlasting fame<br />\nby his \"seventy yard walk,\" and<br />\nthroughout played a star game. Stollenwerck ran the team with rare good<br />\njudgment and gained plenty of ground<br />\nwhen he carried the ball. Bridgman<br />\nwas the brightest star of the backs,<br />\nthough both Mills and Fulton gained<br />\nconsistently when called upon.<br />\nAll of the scoring was done in the<br />\nfirst half \u2014 Dickinson making two<br />\ntouchdowns, thanks quite as much to<br />\nHopkins' fumbles as their own good<br />\nplaying, and \"Babe\" literally walking seventy yards with a ball he found<br />\nsomewhere, nobody knows just where.<br />\nThe second hal was slightly in Hopkins' favor. Fumbles, however, prevented our scoring. Toward the end<br />\nof the game Dickinson showed a little disposition to \"mess things up,\"<br />\n.and they certainly took their own<br />\nsweet time as the half drew towarn<br />\na close, probably feeling that a victory saved by the final whistle was<br />\nbetter than a tied score.<br />\nContinued on page 2.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nThe News-Letter<br />\nr---Vol. XIV.

Woods,<br />\n'to, because of pressure of studies.<br />\nMr. Woods has been a member of<br />\nthe staff for the last two years, and<br />\nwe trust that, as far as time will permit, he will continue his contributions<br />\nto our columns.<br />\nWe publish in another column a<br />\nletter just received from an alumnus,<br />\nconcerning the welfare of the NewsLena. As to alumni interest in the<br />\npaper, it has been pointed out that,<br />\nunlike other colleges, Johns Hopkins<br />\nmaintains no alumni publication, although the project has been several<br />\ntimes seriously considered. In absence of any such publication, and,<br />\nalso, considering the number which<br />\nour in-town alumni have now reached, it is believed that the News-Letter<br />\nmay at least receive a trial to fill the<br />\ndeficiency. An alumni circulation of<br />\nseveral hundred among the city, and<br />\neven at a distance also, would accomp'ish two things: (1) Those alumni<br />\nwho are intersted in the University<br />\nt:ctivities would be continually posted<br />\nevery week as to events about to take<br />\nplace here\u2014an information more reliable than that gained from rumor.<br />\n(2) Alumni may always find in the<br />\nNews-Letter a vehicle for expression of opinion as to questions concerning those University affairs which<br />\nfrom time to time arise for discussion. The alumnus may find<br />\nthrough the News-Letter columns the<br />\naudience to which he wishes to appeal.<br />\nConsidering, then, that the NewsLetter can readily be of service in<br />\nthese two directions, the Board is this<br />\nyear attempting to form a large<br />\nalumni subscription list. The suggestions and attitude of several members of the Alumni Council have been<br />\nso encouraging that it has been<br />\nthought reasonable to make the attempt.<br /><br />\nThe time for the annual University debate is fast approaching, and<br />\nif the call for candidates has not already been issued, the trumpet will<br />\nsurely be heard to sound before long.<br />\nThe debate committee has been appointed, and arrangements are being<br />\nmade for the conflict. The University<br />\nteam will lose several men by graduation, and it is hoped that new candidates will appear from all the<br />\nclasses at the University. Freshmen<br />\nrarely make the University team, but,<br />\njust as the \"scrubs\" in football are of<br />\nthe greatest service, the freshmen in<br />\ndebate, too, always form good material for practice for the older candidates. It is to be hoped, then, that<br />\na large crop of debaters will report<br />\nwhen the. call is issued.<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter,<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University:<br />\nAlumni of the late nineties will<br />\nremember that the News-Letter was<br />\nfirst conducted as an experiment, and<br />\nthat it did not receive final sanction<br />\nfrom the Trustees until it had proved<br />\nitself harmless. Since that time until<br />\nthe present year the paper has been<br />\na fortnightly periodical, and successive boards of editors have struggled<br />\nwith the problem of giving it a definite character. It has been a belated<br />\nnewspaper, a hasty and slender literary magazine, and ineffecti.ye comic<br />\njournal; but it has never, I think,<br />\nsucceeded in being distinctively one<br />\nthing or the other. The present board<br />\nof editors is to be commended for<br />\nits solution of the problem. The NewsLetter as a thorough-going college<br />\nnewspaper is at least consistent with<br />\nits name and dominated by a consistent purpose.<br />\nThis change in the form and purpose of the paper is so great as to<br />\nmake it practically a new venture. If<br />\nit is to succeed and grow into the<br />\nplace that exists for it in Hopkins<br />\nlife, it must be supported, first of<br />\nall, by the students. The editors<br />\ncount upon such support and they will<br />\ndoubtless receive it. But there are<br />\ntwo other classes whose good opinion<br />\nthe paper needs and whose approval<br />\nthe editors may, through a natural<br />\ndelicacy, hesitate to ask for boldly.<br />\nI mean the faculty and the alumni.<br />\nIn past years some members of the<br />\nfaculty have frankly and consistently<br />\ndisapproved of the News-Letter.<br />\nThemselves editors of or contributors<br />\nto learned journals that carry the<br />\nfame of Johns Hopkins abroad, they<br />\nwinced at the amateurishness of the<br />\nstudent journal and cried out against<br />\nthe youthful slips in proofreading that<br />\nmarred its pages. Such persons<br />\nshould be mollified by the change to<br />\na weekly. A newspaper may be pardoned some marks of haste. A college newspaper may show signs of<br />\nunpracticed, or even careless, hands<br />\nwithout disgracing us abroad or at<br />\nhome.<br />\nOther members of the faculty have<br />\npaid for the News-Letter and have<br />\nnever given it a further thought. The<br />\nproof-reading didn't trouble them, for<br /><br />\nthey never saw it; unless some specially egregious blunder was brought<br />\nto their notice. Members of the faculty who have been indifferent to the<br />\nNews-Letter may perhaps find in the<br />\nfuture that as a student transcript of<br />\nwhat is going on and a useful forecast of what is about to come it is<br />\nworthy of a passing glance.<br />\nThe other class, the alumni, have<br />\nhitherto taken no interest whatever<br />\nin the paper. This is not surprising,<br />\nfor until a year or two ago the great<br />\nmajority of the alumni seemed little<br />\ninterested in anything that their successors in the University were doing.<br />\nThe notable awakening of the alumni<br />\nthat has taken place in the last two<br />\nyears, particularly the formation of<br />\nthe Alumni Council, changes all this.<br />\nThe News-Letter stands ready to<br />\nserve as organ for the new movement<br />\namong Hopkins alumni. Its columns<br />\nare open for their announcements; its<br />\neditors welcome alumni news. They<br />\ndeserve and should receive alumni<br />\nsubscriptions and alumni interest.<br />\nJ. C.

Could they have played<br />\nup to their best form all the time<br />\nthe score board would have told a<br />\ndifferent story.

The Convention is held every four<br />\nyears, and delegates are chosen from<br />\nall the colleges in the United States<br />\nand Canada. The morning and evening sessions are devoted to platform<br />\naddresses, and the afternoons to sectional conferences. There will be<br />\npresent missionary representatives<br />\nfrom every country in the world, and<br />\nmany speakers of world-wide reputation. The Hopkins Association is allowed three representatives. Besides<br />\nthe General Secretary and Mr. J. F.<br />\nHunter, W. 0. Weyforth and S. E.<br />\nPickering have been chosen as delegates.. Every student has received<br />\nsome of the slips which read \"An ad<br />\nin the Hopkins Handbook pays.\" This<br />\nyear the Association will lose about<br />\ntwenty-five or thirty dollars on the<br /><br />\nHandbook, and it would be appreciated if the student would use the<br />\nslips when making purchases of our<br />\nadvertisers. Since we have no dormitories where goods may be sent, the<br />\nstores have no means of ascertaining<br />\nthe amount of Hopkins trade they receive. We have taken this way of<br />\ninforming them, and hope the students will use the slips.
