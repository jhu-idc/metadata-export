Students can be<br />\nheard complaining about various<br />\naspects of this nebulous phenomenon, ranging from the pithy<br />\nfavorite, \"College Sucks,\" to<br />\nmove thoughtful comments on<br />\nthe quality, breadth and usefulness of an undergraduate<br />\neducation.<br />\nThe idea of an undergraduate education at Hopkins . is<br />\n<br />\nparticularly problematic because<br />\nthe University was initially conceived of as a graduate institution. Even in the misty realm of<br />\neducation one finds that distinctions between graduate and<br />\nundergraduate learning have<br />\nbeen made. Graduate students<br />\nare expected to be fairly independent, motivated and capable<br />\nof formulating their own ideas.<br />\nConversely, undergraduate students are conceived of as dependent quasi-adolescents who require support in fashioning their<br />\nthoughts and encouragement<br />\n(read: regimentation) in their<br />\nstudies.<br />\nIt would appear,<br />\ntherefore, that the type of<br />\ncont. on p. 6<br />\n<br />\nAn Oddly Human Document<br />\nWhat are intentions worth?<br />\nThe Judicial Code is an oddly human<br />\ndocument: it is full of contradictions,<br />\nflaws, and outright blunders; it has, underneath its semantic problems, a very wellintentioned drive to create some workable<br />\nsystem; and most important, its strengths<br />\nand weaknesses came from an ongoing<br />\nprocess of change.<br />\nAmong its many shortcomings:<br />\nThe people involved in a case can't<br />\nbring a lawyer with them when they appear<br />\nto argue the case. This guarantees a superior position for the University,which retains<br />\nits right to a lawyer.<br />\nThe boundaries of \"sexual misconduct\" are left undefined. We're all out of<br />\nhere, pronto, if someone gets conservative<br />\nwith this one. Why not just say rape,<br />\nassault, and flashing?<br />\nThe Student Council, which would<br />\nchoose Judicial Board members and exercise veto power, would maintain de facto<br />\ncontrol over the board. A fair board is an<br />\nindependent board. Obviously, someone<br />\nhas to hold elections to begin with, but<br />\nafter that, a Judicial Board runs its own<br />\nshop.<br />\nImprovements to the Code can only<br />\ncome as amendents. There is no way to<br />\nrevise the Code's many examples of vague<br />\n<br />\nlanguage before it undergoes a review--in<br />\nthe fall of 1985.<br />\nAnd so on. But beyond its problems<br />\nlies a very basic plus: we finally have a<br />\ndocument that provides for due process.<br />\nThe acid test, then:- So what if we<br />\ndon't have a Judicial Code?<br />\nEventually, we should work out a<br />\nmethod of stopping the arbitrary way discipline is meted out. The Judicial Code gives<br />\nstudents a say in the works, which is<br />\nlacking today. We believe, then, that<br />\npassing the document and then working on<br />\nits flaws is better than simply killing the<br />\nCode.<br />\nMike Steele's opinion is that the<br />\nCode cannot be revised, and presented for a<br />\nsecond vote, and presented to the Board of<br />\nTrustees before the year is out should the<br />\nCode be defeated Tuesday. Why not work<br />\naround the red tape by passing the Code<br />\nand continuing to work on it?<br />\nTuesday is a red herring. The<br />\nelection's \"yes\" or \"no\" is not a simple<br />\nrubber stamp about the Code so we can<br />\nstop thinking about it. Whether or not the<br />\nCode passes is not nearly as important as<br />\nwhether it continues to be improved. It is<br />\na complex, flawed, worthy idea which<br />\nneeds ongoing whittling and fixing.<br />\nIntentions, after all, are everything.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\nMost Ridiculous<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI feel that it is my duty as a<br />\nconcerned Hopkins student to<br />\nreply to Mr. Gregory Sullivan's<br />\nletter of last week. While Mr.<br />\nSullivan would like us to believe<br />\nthat the class poll is of no<br />\nimportance to him it is obvious<br />\nthat he wrote his letter solely to<br />\nallow himself the chance to<br />\n\"campaign\" for the title of<br />\n\"most disgusted.\" Come on,<br />\nGreg!

I, for one, spent<br />\nseveral hours agonizing over my<br />\nvotes before coming up with<br />\nwhat I felt were worthy candidates. It was well worth my<br />\ntime.<br />\nIt has, however,come to my<br />\nattention that several categories<br />\n(particularly important ones at<br />\nthat) were omitted from the list<br />\n(which, parenthetically, is pretty<br />\nnifty as it was originally printed). I suggest<br />\nthe following<br />\nadditions:<br />\n1) class pole<br />\n2)best terrorist<br />\n3) most undressed<br />\n4) most Caucasian<br />\n5) most anemic<br />\n6) most least<br />\n7) best haircut<br />\nThese additions will really<br />\nhelp improve our class poll. By<br />\nadding more categories others<br />\n<br />\nwill be able to get the recognition they deserve (too bad you<br />\nwon't be one of them Greg!).<br />\nHard as it may be to imagine it is<br />\npossible that even more enthusiasm will be generated by the<br />\nexistence of additional listings in<br />\nour class pole (oops, poll).<br />\nShape up Greg--you and<br />\nyour kind make me disgusted!<br />\nLouis J.

Should the<br />\nmother have the baby and try<br />\nand raise it on her own? Think<br />\nof the baby: how would he be<br />\nable to cope with not having a<br />\nfather and having a mother who<br />\nis rarely home because she is<br />\nworking to support a child?<br />\nSure it isn't mature to have<br />\nall of the fun and not deal with<br />\nthe consequences.<br />\nBut let's<br />\nface it:17 year olds are idealists.<br />\nThey think\u2014\"sure I could get<br />\npregnant, but I won't.

I had to<br />\nmake a decision on my own,<br />\nwith help from a very few<br />\nsupportive friends. I realized<br />\nthat the right thing for me to do<br />\nwas to have an abortion.

On the surface, the<br />\nnecessity and advantages of<br />\nhaving a judicial code in force<br />\nare apparent.

So<br />\nwhose intention is it? Isn't it<br />\nrather like putting the cart<br />\nbefore the horse to have a<br />\nreferendum to approve a judicial<br />\ncode prior to ascertaining via the<br />\nelections process whether students want a code at all?

In<br />\naddition, a Common Law Log is<br />\nestablished and open to the<br />\npublic so that precedents in<br />\nterms of jurisdiction will be<br />\nestablished.- z3) An appellate<br />\nsystem is established; not only<br />\nfor decisions of guilt or innocenee but also for appealling the<br />\n<br />\nbehoove us all to read this<br />\nproposed code carefully.<br />\nMoving right into the text,<br />\nwe find that the Code applies to<br />\nall Hopkins undergraduates, covering all offenses committed on<br />\nUniversity property, offenses<br />\ncommitted off campus against<br />\na student or employee of JFIU,<br />\nand criminal offenses committed<br />\noff campus by a student.

Why shouldn't this<br />\nstatement include some justification of the complainant's right<br />\nto lauch his dispute via the<br />\nUniversity's judicial process?<br />\nIt's pretty obvious that the<br />\npotential for narassing complaints is great, and some concern for protection of the<br />\nstudent's rights should be displayed.

The<br />\nvery title makes clear the<br />\nauthor's intention to launch an<br />\nabhorrent attack not only on<br />\nWallk's policies, but his personality as well. While the former is<br />\ncertainly fair game, the latter is<br />\nirrelevant in a responsible editorial. The author portrays Wallk as<br />\na power-grabbing do-nothing.<br />\nWallk has actually been somewhat of an innovator, personally<br />\nresponsible for the Bus to the<br />\nBoss project and currently<br />\nattempting to create a credited<br />\ninternship program similar to the<br />\nHopkins Mayor's Fellowship.<br />\nThe idea of a president-V.P.<br />\nticket at first seems clique-ish or<br />\nfactional. But this innovation is<br />\nWallk's sincere attempt to increase the Council's efficiency<br />\nby enabling the two top officers<br />\nto work together as closely as<br />\nIn providing this<br />\npossible.<br />\ncoordinated partnership, Wallk is<br />\nattempting to remedy problems<br />\nabout which the News-Letter<br />\nperennially complains. Yet the<br />\neditorial's author unfairly identifies these problems with Wallk<br />\nand<br />\nhimself,<br />\nwithout<br />\nwell-rounded evidence. Worst of<br />\nall, under the label of responsible journalism, it borders on<br />\nlibel.<br />\n<br />\nI would like to express<br />\ndisgust with the way the controversy surrounding the COC<br />\nChairman, Mike Wallk, was<br />\nhandled in the issue of February<br />\n27, 1981.<br />\nPrimarily, I question Tara<br />\nRumbarger's timing in exhuming<br />\nthe issue of alleged integrity of<br />\nCOC procedures. According to<br />\nthe complainants, the issue<br />\nneeded to be readdressed because it hasn't been aired<br />\nenough. The whole affair ended<br />\nover ten weeks ago. If it needs<br />\nmore airing now,it needed more<br />\nthen and Rumbarger and Mike<br />\nJohnson would have best served<br />\nthe student body by doing so<br />\nimmediately. Thus, the issues<br />\ncurrent resurfacing seems more a<br />\npolitical ploy on the part of the<br />\nStudent Council Vice Presidential candidate. Rumbarger alleges<br />\nWallk discussed her possible<br />\nappointment<br />\nwith<br />\nChris<br />\nColombo.<br />\nThat interchange<br />\nJeff Lamkin<br />\nconsisted of Wallk's asking<br />\nColombo<br />\none<br />\nshort The SC's Usefulness<br />\nquestion--wasn't Rumbarger the<br />\nOrientation Chairperson the To the Editor:<br />\nprevious year--and Colombo's<br />\nequally short response.

Until<br />\n10 years ago Hopkins did the<br />\nsame, stressing its reputation<br />\nfirst as a research/graduate institution, and second as an undergraduate university. This emphasis was reflected in the<br />\nstudent body by a higher ratio<br />\nof graduates to undergraduates<br />\nas well as in the faculty, made<br />\nup primarily of professors interested in independent research.<br />\nHopkins was and is particularly<br />\nattractive to research-oriented<br />\nprofessors. Because the University pays faculty members for 9.<br />\nmonths (75 percent of the year),<br />\nJHU professors are free to<br />\nfollow their own interests; most<br />\nother research institutions however pay only 50 percent of<br />\none's salary, forcing a professor<br />\nto seek less creative but more<br />\nlucrative contracts from the<br />\ngovernment or private industry<br />\nto make up the difference.<br />\nTen years ago Hopkins<br />\nfound itself in serious financial<br />\ntroubles which jeopardized its<br />\nability to continue to offer an<br />\nindependent research environment. The following solution<br />\nwas proposed: bring in more<br />\nundergraduates to increase revenues, while keeping the number of faculty members, and<br />\ntherefore the costs, Fixed.<br />\nToday, as a result, we have a<br />\nlarger discontented undergraduate body, a relatively smaller<br />\nbeleagered faculty, and an administration trying to keep<br />\neverybody happy.<br />\nIt was and is a mistake to<br />\nadvertize Hopkins as a primarily<br />\nundergraduate institution. Although we do not lack all the<br />\namenities of \"undergraduate<br />\nlife,\" it is clear that if you<br />\nare looking for fun in the sun<br />\nyou'd be much happier at USC.<br />\nIf is also unfair for both faculty<br />\nmembers and students to saddle<br />\nthe latter with the 'bureaucratic<br />\nred tape attendent to undergraduate advising. It has been<br />\nmy experience that most professors are more than willing to<br />\ndiscuss the subject matter of a<br />\ncourse with a student, but<br />\npractically disappear during advising period when they are sure<br />\nto be barraged by add/drop<br />\nsheets and the like. A separation<br />\nof academic advising and administrative advising could,'with an<br />\nincrease in the administration<br />\nstaff, solve this problem.<br />\nHopkins as an undergraduate institution can be made a<br />\nmore effective environment by<br />\nstressing the school's inherent<br />\nstrengths rather than putting a<br />\nstrain on its resources. Recruiters should describe JHU as it<br />\nreally is: a research university<br />\nthat places a multitude of<br />\nresources at the disposal of all of<br />\nits students to make use of as<br />\nthey see fit. Not all undergraduates seek undergrad utopia<br />\nor post high school preparation.<br />\nMany would do well in an<br />\n<br />\nindependent atmosphere, and<br />\nwould probably appreciate their<br />\neducations more if they get what<br />\nthey expected, and not some<br />\nwatered-down compromise.<br />\nGranted, as college admissions continue to decline across<br />\nthe country, it might be hard<br />\nfor universities to maintain enrollment. Nevertheless, I suspect<br />\nthat while fewer people will be<br />\nenrolling in college, those who<br />\nmatriculate will be doing so to<br />\nget an education and not a four<br />\n(or five) year all-expenses-paid<br />\nvacation. By emphasizing its<br />\nstrengths, Hopkins would have a<br />\nhappier faculty and student<br />\nbody, and begin to realize its<br />\npotential in the bargain.<br />\nI would like to thank Dr.<br />\nMichael Karweit, and Dr.<br />\nStanley Corrison indirectly for<br />\ntheir thoughts on education at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n<br />\ncont. from p. 5<br />\nin my opinion, would be to<br />\nplace student government under<br />\na \"sunset law\", similar to that<br />\nwhich exists in many states.<br />\nWhat it would mean would be<br />\nthat the student council would<br />\nhave to justify its existence to<br />\nthe student body every year by a<br />\nreferendum. If the referendum<br />\npassed, the council would continue in existence and know that<br />\nat least half of the student<br />\nsupport them or at least the<br />\nprograms they administer. It<br />\nwould be difficult to complain<br />\nabout student government if you<br />\nknew that at least half of your<br />\nfellow students supported the<br />\nidea.<br />\nOn the other hand, if the<br />\nstudents voted against student<br />\ngovernment, it would be no<br />\ngreat tragedy either. Student<br />\ngovernment would be ended, as<br />\nit ought to be if most of the<br />\nstudents think that it's useless.<br />\n<br />\nIf as it turns out, student government did turn out to be as<br />\nvital as its proponents contend<br />\nthat it is, then it could be<br />\nthe<br />\nreinstated<br />\nfollowing<br />\nyear--again, with a mandate of<br />\nsupport.<br />\nThe present situation should<br />\nnot be allowed to continue.

But let's look at Section B:<br />\nMaintenance of Judicial Board<br />\nRecords. \"1.

Wilson Shaffer: A Man For All Seasons<br />\nBY STEPHANIE REYNOLDS<br />\nGeorge Wilson Shaffer first<br />\ncame to Hopkins as an undergraduate in 1920. Over the next<br />\n60 years, he served as professor,<br />\nathletic director, and dean.<br />\nThough retired since 1967, Dr.<br />\nShaffer (his friends call him<br />\nWilson) still maintains an office<br />\nin the basement of Homewood<br />\nHouse. Unknown to all but a<br />\nhandful of students, he remains<br />\nbeloved to those who worked<br />\nwith him.<br />\nShaffer was born in Baltimore on November 23, 1901.<br />\nAfter graduating from high<br />\nschool at Baltimore City College,<br />\nhe entered Hopkins at the start<br />\nof the Roaring Twenties. Despite student years which included making bathtub gin and<br />\ntaking part in an illegal bonfire,<br />\nShaffer received an A.B. in 1924<br />\nand a Ph.D. in 1928 in Psychology. The library holds several<br />\ncopies of his Ph.D. thesis, titled<br />\nAlertness and Motor Abilities of<br />\nAthletes and Non-Athletes. After working for several years at<br />\nShepphard and Enoch Pratt<br />\nHospital as a clinical psychologist, Shaffer returned to Hopkins<br />\nas a professor in 1934.<br />\nThe chairman of the Psychology Department, at the time,<br />\nwas leaving on sabbatical and<br />\nShaffer took over teaching his<br />\ncourses. That year, Shaffer also<br />\nbecame athletic director and<br />\nstarted a revolutionary new<br />\nprogram there. In 1937,Shaffer<br />\ncreated the psychological clinic<br />\nlater to be called the White<br />\nHouse. By 1942, Shaffer was<br />\nDean of the College of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nAs athletic director, Shaffer<br />\ninstituted reforms in the Physical Education Department suggested by University President<br />\nJoseph Ames. According to<br />\nShaffer, Ames was profoundly<br />\ninfluenced by a statement made<br />\nby the Carnegie Foundation<br />\nwhich deplored the commercialism of college athletics. In an<br />\ninterview last week, Shaffer<br />\ndescribed the athletics reforms<br />\nin this way:<br />\nDr. Ames, who was then the<br />\nPresident, decided that college<br />\nathletics was too commercialized, that we were paying<br />\nattention to the people who<br />\nwere the stars and he appointed<br />\na committee to do something<br />\nabout it. Up to that point, the<br />\nathletics had been run by an<br />\nalumnus and the committee decided that it should he run by a<br />\nmember of the faculty. I was<br />\ninterested enough and was the<br />\nonly member of the faculty who<br />\nhad ever been a professional<br />\nathlete, so I drew the task...<br />\nThey decided that they would<br />\ndrop football which was considered really the thing and focus<br />\nprimarily on the intramural<br />\nprogram. The budget for the<br />\nyear was $21,000. That was to<br />\ninclude salaries. And I immedianew<br />\nfive<br />\nadded<br />\ntely<br />\nsoccer,.<br />\nsports\u2014fencing,<br />\nwrestling, golf, and brought<br />\nhack baseball, which had been in<br />\nthe earlier history, hut disappeared for a long time.<br />\nShaffer solved the budget<br />\nproblem in the Physical Educa-<br />\n<br />\ntion Department by giving grad- money in. These were competiuate scholarships to three Hop- tive games, so they would hire a<br />\nkins students in return for their pitcher. We got most of the<br />\ncoaching talents. After this first money from the hat.<br />\nShaffer also signed a conyear, football was de-emphasized<br />\nand admission was no longer tract to play professional basecharged for games. A physical ball with the New York Giants.<br />\neducation program was required He practiced with the team for<br />\ntwo weeks, but never actually<br />\nof all freshmen:<br />\nWe used the use the first sem- played because, in order to start<br />\nester primarily to let the boys spring training in February, he<br />\nget to know each other some- would have had to drop out of<br />\nwhere outside the classroom; we high school:<br />\n<br />\nused soccer and touch football.<br />\nBut we did manage to teach<br />\nthem all at least one carry-over<br />\nsport. They had to either play<br />\nsome tennis, badminton, golf or<br />\nhandball because my assumption<br />\nwas, at the time, that, when you<br />\nfinished college, you would have<br />\ntrouble finding 40 boys to play<br />\nsoccer or lacrosse with, hut you<br />\ncould go out with one other<br />\nperson and get recreation. The<br />\nPhysical education requirement<br />\nfor freshmen was eliminated in<br />\nthe Sixties:<br />\nThat was one of the mistakes of<br />\nthe '60's. During the last '60's,<br />\nthat was a couple ofyears after I<br />\nretired, a small number of boys<br />\ncomplained that they didn't<br />\nwant to take physical education... Faculties and administrators in the late '60's and early<br />\n'70's were very scared of the<br />\nstudents. In various places, they<br />\nwere burning downhuildings and<br />\nso somebody complained, they<br />\nrelaxed and gave in. I guess ifI<br />\nhad still been there, I would not<br />\nhave gone for it and I might have<br />\nbeen tarred and feathered.<br />\nThe reform of the physical<br />\neducation program at Hopkins<br />\nwas noted across the country<br />\nand adopted by other small,<br />\nEastern universities.<br />\nShaffer's interest in athletics<br />\nhas been lifelong. Starting at the<br />\nage of fifteen, he worked for the<br />\nMaryland Department of Recreation. On Sundays, he played<br />\nbaseball as a pitcher:<br />\nIn the summertime, on Sundays,<br />\nI would go to the'\"little parks.\"<br />\nThey had baseball games with<br />\nno fences around them so they<br />\ncouldn't charge admission. The<br />\ncrowd stood around and at some<br />\ntime a fellow would go around<br />\nwith a hat and you'd drop some<br />\n<br />\nBy that time, I had injured the<br />\nmiddle finger on my right hand<br />\nand, as you can see, I'm not big<br />\nenough to he any Jim Palmer. I<br />\ndidn't have a speedball. I didn't<br />\neven have a good curve.<br />\nBecause of strict rules on<br />\namateur competition, Shaffer<br />\nwas not permitted to play<br />\nbaseball after his freshman year<br />\nin high school or in college. He<br />\nwas determined, however, to<br />\nencourage athletics for the<br />\ngreatest number of students at<br />\nHopkins, once he became Director of Athletics.<br />\nIn 1937, Shaffer organized<br />\nthe psychological clinic:<br />\nIn an earlier period of time,<br />\npeople were very hesitant to<br />\ncome and talk about emotional<br />\nproblems. If you had an appendectomy, you'd want to show<br />\nthe scar, but not if it was a<br />\nmental problem...So when Ifirst<br />\nagreed to see the people, I<br />\npurposely arranged an office<br />\naway from the academic office.<br />\nBut I had other things going on<br />\nin that area so that while they<br />\ncame in, no one would no what<br />\nthey were there for. Directly<br />\nafter the war, they came in such<br />\nnumbers and perfectly willing to<br />\naccept the fact that that's what<br />\nthey were doing there, that I had<br />\nto get help. I started by getting<br />\njust one psychiatrist from the<br />\nPhipps Clinic, then added two<br />\nclinical psychologists from the<br />\nPsychology Department. And<br />\nby the time I gave up the clinic<br />\nto Dr. Godenne, we had six<br />\nyoung psychiatrists from Phipps<br />\nand Shapphard Pratt and six<br />\nsenior psychiatrists from the<br />\nsame two places.<br />\n<br />\nShaffer combined the different roles of adminstrator and<br />\nwithout conflict.<br />\ncounselor<br />\nWhen describing him, Shaffer's<br />\nassociates at Hopkins usually<br />\nnote how much he helped the<br />\nstudents. Dr. Lee Park, who<br />\nworked with him in counseling<br />\nthrough the '60's, comments, \"I<br />\nthink what impressed me most<br />\nabout him was his brilliance as<br />\nadministrator, confidante, counselor, and teacher. Students<br />\n<br />\nwere always able to trust him.\"<br />\nBob Scott, now Athletic Director, described Shaffer as \"the<br />\nman behind the scenes,\"in athletics. \"A number of coaches<br />\nhave consulted with him. Probably, there hasn't been anyone<br />\nat Hopkins who contributed<br />\nmore to students or was more<br />\nwilling to help students,\" Scott<br />\nsays.<br />\nIrene Davis Corwin was<br />\nRegistrar most of the time<br />\nShaffer was Dean. She also<br />\nknew him when they were both<br />\nstudents. Corwin says, because<br />\nof the smaller undergraduate<br />\npopulation, \"we knew a great<br />\nmany of the students personalAccording to Corwin,<br />\nly.\"<br />\nShaffer summed up her concept<br />\nof Hopkins because he had been<br />\nundergraduate, graduate student,<br />\nteacher, and administrator.<br />\nHaving been a student at<br />\nHopkins himself, Shaffer had a<br />\ngreater empathy for students<br />\nthan other administrators might<br />\nhave. In March and April of<br />\n1976, a lecture series on the<br />\nhistory of Hopkins was presented by the Evening College and<br />\nSession and the<br />\nSummer<br />\nCEntennial Committee in honor<br />\nof Hopkins' centennial celebration. Shaffer gave the first<br />\nlecture in the building on<br />\ncampus named for him. In this<br />\nsppech, Shaffer described some<br />\nof his adventures as a student at<br />\nHopkins during the '20's:<br />\nMy frat house, a three-story<br />\nhouse, had baths on the second<br />\nand third stories. You took a<br />\nbath on the second floor. In the<br />\nthird floor bathroom, we made<br />\ngin.<br />\nOne of Shaffer's exploits as<br />\na student came back to haunt<br />\n<br />\nhim as an administrator:<br />\nThe students used to have<br />\nbonfires the night before the big<br />\nfootball games. On one of these<br />\noccasions, I was in the fraternity<br />\npalying bridge and a freshman<br />\ncame in, almost in tears, saying<br />\n\"They won't let us light the fire;<br />\nthe firemen and policemen are<br />\ndown there.\" Well, it turned out<br />\nthat three of us got in a little<br />\nautomobile, one on the top with<br />\nsome wood and shacings and<br />\nsome gasoline and drove straight<br />\nup to the fire, shoved it off the<br />\ntop and there was a terrific<br />\nblaze. Some 25 years later,<br />\nwhile I was serving as Dean,<br />\nsome students came to see me<br />\nand said, \"We'd like to have a<br />\nbonfire before the game.\" I<br />\nsaid, \"Well, it's all right with me,<br />\nbut you know the regulations<br />\nare that you have to have<br />\napermit from the fire department.\" So the boys went down<br />\nto the fire department to get the<br />\npermit and the chief came out to<br />\nsee me and he wanted to know,<br />\n\"Where is the fire going to be?\"<br />\nHe wanted to go down and look<br />\nat the amount of wood that was<br />\nthere and how close it was to the<br />\nbuildings. And I drove him<br />\ndown and he looked at it and I<br />\nwill not tell you the indelicate<br />\nexpression that he used when he<br />\nsaid to me I could ... this fire out<br />\nmyself. Then he said, \"111 tell<br />\nyou what used to happen down<br />\nhere\u2014Do you know that about<br />\n25 years ago they had this...\"<br />\nAnd he went through the whole<br />\nbusiness of this thing and I have<br />\nto confess that I didn't have the<br />\ncourage to tell him at the time<br />\nthat I was a part of that situation.<br />\nWhen Shaffer becaome<br />\nDean of the College of Arts and<br />\nSciences, administration was a<br />\nmuch smaller operation than it is<br />\nnow.<br />\nThe President, the<br />\nProvost, and the Deans of<br />\nEngineering and Arts and<br />\nSciences made up all of the<br />\nadministration. Shaffer attributes the smaller scale to a<br />\nsmaller undergraduate population and to the lack of government regulation at that time.<br />\nBefore World War II, undergraduates numbered under 1,000;<br />\nnow there are about 2,500. Not<br />\nonly was the undergraduate<br />\npopulation smaller in absolute<br />\nnumbers, but relative to the<br />\nnumber of graduate students, it<br />\nwas also smaller:<br />\nOne of the real characteristics of this place had always been<br />\nthat the undergraduate population, in terms of number, never<br />\noverpowered the graduate students. It's probably the only<br />\nuniversity in the country where<br />\nthat was true.<br />\nUnlike most 19th-century<br />\ncolleges, Hopkins was founded<br />\nprimarily as a graduate school, in<br />\nthe tradition of European universities.<br />\nThe undergraduate<br />\nCollege of Arts and Sciences was<br />\nmaintained to insure a pool of<br />\nqualified applicants for the<br />\ngraduate programs. The number<br />\nof graduate students began to<br />\ndecline when government agencies began to subsidize undergraduate education during the<br />\ncont. on p. 11<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 10 / MARCH 6, 1981<br />\n\u20220-0 *<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER CLASSIFIED<br />\n<br />\nWEDNEJDATNOON-3ERIE3<br />\nPresented by The Johns Hopkins University Office of Special Events<br />\n<br />\nTRUCKS<br />\nCARS,<br />\nJEEPS,<br />\navailable through government<br />\nsell<br />\nfor<br />\nmany<br />\nunder<br />\nagencies,<br />\n$200.00.

During that<br />\ntime, private foundations reduced their subsidization of graduate students.

Along with<br />\ngovernment aid came government regulation. Much more<br />\nelaborate records were required<br />\nby government agencies. One<br />\nprofessor has described the University as \"a microcosm\u2014a<br />\nreflection of the world in which<br />\nwe live\u2014where we have to<br />\nquasi-judicial<br />\nanswer<br />\nto<br />\nagencies\u2014 Big Brother.\"<br />\nMuch of this transformation<br />\ntook place while Shaffer was<br />\nDean at Hopkins.

Under the<br />\nsupervision of the new president<br />\nof the University, Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower, Shaffer set up the<br />\nprogram essentially still required. Also under Eisenhower's<br />\npresidency, Shaffer set up the<br />\nGraduate Board, which still<br />\nsupervises the awarding of<br />\nPh.D.'s.<br />\nDr. Eisenhower has<br />\ndescribed Shaffer's role as \"indispensable to me, during my<br />\nfirst presidency from 1956 to<br />\n1967.\" Both Eisenhower and<br />\nShaffer retired in 1967, though<br />\nEisenhower returned for a<br />\n<br />\nten-month interim presidency<br />\nin 1971, up to the selection of<br />\nStephen Muller as President, by<br />\nthe Board of Trustees.<br />\nThroughout his career at<br />\nHopkins, Shaffer taught at least<br />\ntwo psychology courses per<br />\nyear. His graduate and undergraduate abnormal psychology<br />\ncourses were always popular.<br />\nThough the undergraduate version generally attracted about<br />\ntwo hundred students, Shaffer<br />\ngraded all of the exams and<br />\nOne of the<br />\npapers himself.<br />\nattractions of the course was<br />\nShaffer's demonstration of hypnosis, a field which always<br />\ninterested him.<br />\nShaffer also taught a course<br />\ncalled \"Autobiographical Study<br />\nof Personality\" in which the six<br />\nto eight students enrolled wrote<br />\nautobiographies.<br />\nlengthy<br />\nShaffer has kept the longest<br />\none, which is more than 450<br />\npages. In his abnormal psychology courses, students were<br />\noften required to write shorter<br />\n<br />\nautobiographies:<br />\nI think that there was hardly a<br />\npre-medical student or a student<br />\nwho was going to take graduate<br />\nwork in clinical psychology who<br />\ndid not take that course. I<br />\nassigned a short autobiography<br />\nin there and I had a laugh with<br />\nsome people, some ten years<br />\nago, on the staff of the Phipps<br />\nClinic. I told them, \"I have the<br />\nautobiography of almost every<br />\none of you.\" A number of<br />\nthe boys, most of them are out<br />\npracticing psychiatry or clinical<br />\npsychology\u2014they write and say,<br />\n\"This is the most useful thing I<br />\never did in my education.\"<br />\nShaffer has written two textbooks, Abnormal Psychology<br />\nand Fundamental Concepts in<br />\nClinical Psychology, both in<br />\ncollaboration with other professors, More recently, he has<br />\nwritten Recreation and Athletics<br />\nat Johns Hopkins: A One-Hundred\u2014 Year-History.<br />\nFriends and associates of<br />\nShaffer usually mention his<br />\n<br />\nsense of humor. He was noted<br />\nfor a lecture he gave many times<br />\ncalled \"The Psychology of<br />\nHumor,\" a study of various<br />\ntypes of humor, which Shaffer<br />\ndemonstrated by giving examples.<br />\nShaffer's style of administration was much more relaxed<br />\nand personal that later administration could be. Robert Roy,<br />\nDean Emeritus of the Engineering School, says Shaffer \"never<br />\nwas mandatory or dictatorial.<br />\nThe general rule around Hopkins<br />\nwas that the various positions<br />\nhad a tremendous degree of<br />\nautonomy. All of the administrators had enormous dedication.\" Eisenhower had described Shaffer as the \"academic<br />\n'troubleshooter\" of the school.<br />\nEdward McDill, chairman of the<br />\nSocial Relations Department,<br />\ncalls Shaffer \"a man for all<br />\nseasons with the ability to bring<br />\nout the best in people and a<br />\ngreat insight into people's behavior.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12/ MARCH 6. 1981<br />\n<br />\nDraft Of The Johns Hopkins University<br />\nUndergraduate Judicial Code<br />\n<br />\nI.

Blumenthal<br />\nThe Lacrosse Field of Play<br />\nSIDE<br />\n<br />\nTime: 2:05 P.M.<br />\nPlace: Homewood Field<br />\nWhen: March 14 Opening Day<br />\n<br />\nAt the referee's whistle, Belcher clamps the ball<br />\nto the ground under the head of his stick, while butting<br />\nhis Blue Jay opponent out of position with a shoulder.<br />\nQuickly the Yale midfielder scoops up the loose ball and<br />\ncharges at the Hopkins goal.<br />\nAfter sprinting 20 yards, Belcher tosses the ball<br />\nto teammate Joe Devlin. Devlin catches it and fires the<br />\nball at the goal, all in the same motion. With a deft<br />\nmovement of his oversized stick, Hopkins netminder<br />\nBrian Holman spears the speeding bullet out of midair.<br />\nImmediately looking downfield, he lofts a<br />\nlooping pass to defenseman Dave Black. Black cradles<br />\nthe ball in his stick several times before spotting Blue<br />\nJay midfielder Joe Ciletti racing toward the midfield<br />\nstripe. Black's perfect pass doesn't cause his former high<br />\nschool teammate to break stride. Hopkins is off and<br />\nrunning.<br />\nAs the three Blue Jay attackmen see the fast<br />\nbreak opportunity develop, they drop back and set up<br />\nclose to the Yale goal. When a Yale defender leaves his<br />\nman to cover the hard-charging Ciletti,-the Hopkins<br />\njunior passes the ball to attackman Jeff Harris.<br />\nIn one graceful motion, Harris catches the ball<br />\njust above his left shoulder, wheels to his right, and fires<br />\na blazing shot into the upper right-hand corner of the<br />\ngoal. A split second later the Hopkins rooting section<br />\nyells its approval.<br />\nElapsed time: 25 seconds. The sport: lacrosse!<br />\nMarch 14 marks the unofficial 89th celebration<br />\nof the rites of spring at Hopkins. For on the Homewood<br />\ncampus, spring is synonymous with lacrosse. The sport<br />\nis to Hopkins what football is to Notre Dame and<br />\nbasketball is to UCLA. Yale has its bulldog, Princeton<br />\n<br />\nWING<br />\n<br />\nAREA<br />\n<br />\n- 2\"(5.08cm)<br />\n15 YDS<br />\n(13 72m)<br />\n<br />\n40 YDS<br />\n(.34.5.9m)<br />\n<br />\n4\"(1011>(m)<br />\n<br />\n\u2014<br />\n<br />\n2\"--\u2022\u2014\u2022-- 15 08cm)<br />\nLL1<br />\n<br />\n-- 40<br />\nYDS<br />\n(3658m)<br />\n<br />\n_J<br />\n6'(183.1<br />\n<br />\nYale's Mark Belcher<br />\nand Hopkin's Ned Radebaugh crouch while positioning their sticks backto-back on the field.

Moreover, one quarter of those inducted into the Lacrosse Hall of Fame have been associated with Hopkins.<br />\nFor Blue Jay sports fans, THE SEASON has<br />\narrived. Pavlov would have felt at home at Hopkins,<br />\nsince any Hoppie worth his weight in GPA points has<br />\nbeen conditioned to flee the confines of the Eisenhower<br />\nlibrary for the excitement of Homewood Field. On a<br />\ntypical Saturday afternoon in the spring, enough Hopkins students descend upon the Conrad Geblein stands<br />\nto make the untrained observer think that Organic and<br />\nOcc. Civ. review sessions are now being taught outside.<br />\nWhen the Blue Jays defeated Maryland to win<br />\nthe NCAA championship in 1974 and 1979, the Hopkins<br />\nrooters sang \"Amen\"--presumably to mock the Terrapin<br />\nfans who traditionally sing it in victory. Lacrosse<br />\ndisciples know better, however. They are convinced that<br />\nit was done to show that lacrosse is akin to religion at<br />\nHopkins!<br />\nAt Johns Hopkins, which considers itself the<br />\ncenter of the lacrosse world, national titles are expected<br />\nby everyone. Blue Jay coaches do not celebrate when<br />\nthey win a championship; instead they breathe a sigh of<br />\nrelief.<br />\nAccording to athletic director Bob Scott,<br />\n\"Lacrosse is a fast-moving and exciting sport. The<br />\nwide-open action presents many scoring opportunities<br />\nduring the course of a game. Fifteen to twenty-five<br />\ngoals are commonly scored, and in my view lacrosse<br />\ncontains the best elements of football, basketball,<br />\nsoccer, and hockey.\"<br />\nThe fastest game on two feet (hockey is played<br />\non skates), lacrosse is an exciting and invigorating game<br />\nwhich is fun to watch and to play. At its best, the sport<br />\ncombines the body contact of Stanley Cup hockey with<br />\nthe agility, grace, and quickness of NBA basketball.<br />\n<br />\nBob Ott, a former star midfielder at Maryland,<br />\ncalled lacrosse \"a jumble of all games. I enjoy the<br />\nviolence like football. There is plenty of free running<br />\nlike soccer. The play around the goal is much like<br />\nbasketball, and the stick makes it like hockey.\"<br />\nLacrosse was invented by North American<br />\nIndians. They employed wooden sticks with a netted<br />\nloop at one end and a ball made of wood or of deerskin<br />\nfilled with animal hair. As many as a-thousand warriors<br />\nin full war paint played on a field several miles long<br />\nwithout sidelines. Games lasted two or three days and<br />\ndefeat sometimes meant death.<br />\nFrenchmen named the game la crosse because the<br />\nIndians' sticks reminded them of a crosier, a long staff<br />\nresembling a shepherd's crook usually carried by bishops<br />\nas a symbol of office. The Indians used the game to<br />\ncondition their young braves for battle. Often tribal<br />\nmedicine men served as \"game officials.\"<br />\nThe Europeans who came to the New World<br />\ngreatly reduced the number of participants in a contest.<br />\nHowever, they preserved the essential idea of trying to<br />\nthrow a ball into a goal defended by one's enemies,<br />\nwhile protecting one's own goal from violation. All<br />\nthrowing and catching was still done with a curved,<br />\nnetted stick.<br />\nThe modern game of lacrosse is played on a<br />\nrectangular field, 110 yards long and 60 yards wide.<br />\nGoals consist of netted six-foot squares 80 yards apart.<br />\nPlayers frequently carry the ball behind the cage to set<br />\nup offensive plays, since the goals are positioned 15<br />\nyards from the endlines.<br />\nPlayers wear uniforms consisting of helmets with<br />\na metal face mask, hockey-style gloves, arm pads, and<br />\nfrequently shoulder pads. Football-style jerseys have,<br />\nreplaced tribal body paint, but the use of black grease<br />\nunder each eye to ward off the sun's glare recalls the<br />\nsavage, majestic, boundaryless game played by the<br />\nIndians.<br />\nEach team consists of three attackmen, three<br />\nmidfielders, three defensemen, and one goalie. As in<br />\nfootball, a game consists of four 15-minute periods with<br />\na halftime intermission.

Strengths: Goalie Peter Cordrey (.635<br />\nsave percentage), Tom Smyth (defense), Kelly Doherty<br />\n(midfield). Weaknesses: The loss of two strong scorers<br />\non the attack makes this part of the Tiger lineup vulnerable.<br />\nAPRIL 4<br />\n1:00 P.M. VIRGINIA. Last years score: 9-12,9-8<br />\n(2 ot). Last years record: 12-2. Believe you me, the<br />\nMCATs just weren't scheduled with Hopkins in mind.<br />\nLast year's loss to Virginia was exciting--it put the<br />\nCavaliers in the catbird seat for the entire season, and<br />\nthe Jays were forced to dethrone them in double overtime. If there is any team to watch except for Hopkins,<br />\nthe Wahoos are it. Ciccarone: The key to the Virginia<br />\ngame will be the close defense and working on our<br />\nmidfield. In addition to their returning midfield (Rick<br />\nGiusto, Ray Giusto, Lou Ruland,face-off phenom Steve<br />\nKraus), they have recruited five more freshmen midPhenomenal sophomore Mike<br />\nfielders. Strengths:<br />\n<br />\nChester Wagstaff<br />\n<br />\nSo, now that you have learned how the game is<br />\nplayed, lets map out the scenairo for the coming season.<br />\nOn Saturday, March 14, the long drought is over. Local<br />\nlacrosse fans, deprived of the joys of lax over the long<br />\nwinter months, forced to subsist on a diet of football<br />\nand basketball, with a garnish of indoor soccer, will all<br />\narrive for the sumptuous banquet known as Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nThe old -adage, \"you can't tell the players without a<br />\nprogram\", holds in Lacrosse, so I'm going to attempt to<br />\nshow you the competition, and the Hopkins opinion of<br />\nit, provided by coach Henry Ciccarone.<br />\nHere, in order then, is the Hopkins schedule:<br />\nMARCH 14<br />\n2:00 P.M. Home. YALE. Last years score: 23-3.<br />\nLast years recprd: (3-11). To say that the Elis look a<br />\nlittle bit sick is a bit of an understatement. Under coach<br />\nBob McHenry, the Yale men went winless in the Ivy<br />\nLeague. This year, the Elis receive new blood from<br />\nCoach Mike Waldvogel, whose position as an assistant on<br />\nRichie Morans Cornell squad has brought the Big Red<br />\nmuch success. Ciccarone: With a new coach they<br />\nshould be able to improve on last years record relying on<br />\nthe strength of their returnees. They have recruited a<br />\nnumber of football players to give speed and strength if<br />\nnot lacrosse savvy. They will need a few years to rebuild. Strengths: Mike Devlin (attack), Steve Rice<br />\nWeakness: Loss of goalie Craig Hornig.<br />\n(attack).<br />\nMARCH 22<br />\n1:30 P.M. Manhasset High School, L.I., N.Y.<br />\nHARVARD. Last years score: 13-3,16-2(QF). Last<br />\nyears record: (11-3). The Jays return for their third<br />\nconsecutive performance in the Day of Champions at<br />\nManhasset. This years opponent, the Harvard Crimson,<br />\nwill probably be one of the toughest games the Big Blue<br />\nhas ever played on the Island. After winning the Ivy<br />\nLeague title last season, the Crimson was handed two of<br />\nits three defeats at the hands of Hopkins. Returning 18<br />\nlettermen, including the phenomenal freshman Brendan<br />\nMeagher, whose four goals and one assist in the NCAA<br />\nquarter finals against the Jays made him the unanimous<br />\nchoice for the 1980 Peter Banker Award, given by<br />\nHopkins to the best opposing player of the year. C-ccaronP: Harvard will probably be the most dangerous<br />\nteam we will face. They bring back almost the whole<br />\nteam, and have a lot more confidence after holding us<br />\nclose in the playoffs. We are at a bit of a disadvantage<br />\nbecause we will not have seen them play before this<br />\ngame.

Home. WASHINGTON COLLEGE. Last<br />\nyears score: 18-1. Last years record: 4-7. With little<br />\ntime to prepare, the Jays return from the Island to face<br />\ntheir perennial rival, Washington College. The Shoremen<br />\nare top contenders for this years Division III crown, and<br />\nlast years score does not belie the ability of the returning<br />\nfreshmen and sophomores.

Last years score:<br />\n8-4. Last years record: 7-6. When the Tigers trot<br />\ndown from the swamps of Jersey, you can hope to see a<br />\nbetter game than last year's, which, played in the driving<br />\nrain and a swampy Long Island field, will not soon be<br />\nforgotten. While the Jays almost lost that one, they<br />\nhope this years contest will be a little drier. Ciccarone:<br />\nPrinceton has always had a competitive team? if you get<br />\ndown with a few quick goals, they can stay on top of<br />\n<br />\nCoach Henry Ciccarone: his team is a reason to smile.<br />\nCaravana returns.

Face-off man Steve<br />\nKraus took 19 of 20 face-offs from the Jays in the final<br />\ngame, and will continue to work for control. Goalie<br />\nBrian Gregory is back, along with strong support from<br />\ntwo backups. Weaknesses: Loss of two key defenders<br />\nwill hurt the Wahoos, but look for a more midfield oriented defense.

While the<br />\nactivities of Spring Fair rage on the Hopkins campus, the<br />\nreal action will move to Ithaca, where the Jays challenge<br />\nthe Big Red. After early season difficulties last year, the<br />\nyoung Cornell team moved into the last berth of the<br />\nplayoffs and lost a nail-biter to Virginia in overtime.<br />\nCiccarone: The Cornell team lost few of its players to<br />\ngraduation. After their surprising finish last year, they<br />\nare certainly a dangerous team. Although we don't<br />\nknow about their recruits of the new season we will look<br />\nfor them to be strong. Strengths: Mike Lynch, Stam<br />\nHappel, and goalie Tom Wagner on defense. Weaknesses: Loss of their two top scorers will open up new<br />\nopportunities for the younger players, but can the fill<br />\nthe gap.<br />\nAPRIL 18<br />\n2:00 P.M. Home. Army: Last year's score: 11-10.<br />\n<br />\nLast year's record: 84. Last year's game against the<br />\nBlack Knights was almost the year's biggest disaster for<br />\nthe Jays. Ahead 9-5, the Jays allowed the Cadets to<br />\nfight back to a 10-10 tie. Goalie Mike Federico held<br />\ntight in the goal however, and the Hopkins squad eked it<br />\nout 11-10. This year, with home field advantage and<br />\nwithout goalie Kevin MacGibbon, the Knights may fall<br />\nprey to the power of the Blue. Ciccarone: We were<br />\nlucky to get away with a win last year? they aren't a<br />\nteam to play if you want to look good. Strengths:<br />\nDefenders Bob Henry, Pete Hillebrand, middie Ed<br />\nBollenbacher and attacker Frank Gordiano. Weaknesses:<br />\nLoss of goalie MacGibbon.<br />\nAPRIL 25<br />\n2:00 P.M. Byrd Stadium. MARYLAND. Last<br />\nyear's score: 15-6. Last year's record: 5-5. The Terps<br />\nare coming off a lousy year, internal problems and a<br />\ngamut of near disasters. The loss of coach Buddy Beardmore to business may hurt the team, but his successor,<br />\nformer Maryland star and University of Baltimore coach<br />\nDino Mattessich, will have a good base of operations<br />\nwith his returning talent. Ciccarone: Maryland has<br />\nrecruited a good group of junior college players this<br />\nyear. Their fall lacrosse program was described as one.<br />\nthat had a lot of hustle, something many Maryland<br />\nteams haven't relied on. Last year I felt that they were<br />\nthe team that could dethrone us, but their season was<br />\ndisastrous with the final loss to University of Baltimore.<br />\nIf the team can recover from that, they will be tough<br />\nthis year.

Their<br />\nability to scar a perfect Homecoming weekend is proven,<br />\nbut this game won't be one to miss. .Ciccarone: The<br />\nteam's offense looks solid, but they might have some<br />\nimprovement with the loss of Mike Buzzell. If Buzzell<br />\nwas neutralized, the whole team offense could be shut<br />\ndown. Now, with Mike gone, the team may spread the<br />\noffensive chores around. Strengths: Syd Abernathy and<br />\nRich Wellman may dominate the new attack, while<br />\ngoalies Scott Bartkowski and Pat Brannigan look sharp.<br />\nWeaknesses:.

Despite all the<br />\nflights of fancy and anarchy, we never<br />\nforget that we're hearing a country &<br />\nwestern song, and that these different<br />\nmusical styles are in fact strengthening<br />\neach other in some crazy way as they<br />\ncombine within the rendition.<br />\nThe<br />\noverall effect is simultaneously funny<br />\nand striking.

Country<br />\nmusic is a uniquely American genre<br />\nwhich, at its best, like the blues, can be<br />\ngenuinely expressive.<br />\nChadbourne<br />\nchooses old C&W classics like Roger\u2022<br />\nMiller's \"Dang Me,\" Johnny Paycheck's<br />\n\"Take This Job and chove It,\" Merle<br />\nHaggard's \"Swingin' Doors,\" and Bobby<br />\nBare's \"Motel Time Agaut.\" These songs<br />\ndispense their ow r brand of fatalistic<br />\nphilosophy and rearieck stoicism. They<br />\nare the white man's blues--bittersweet<br />\nLaments based on recurring themes<br />\nand situations (symbols?): women, bars,<br />\nmotels, hard work, jail, the good life,<br />\nescape. They often contain an undercurrent of maudlin humor (sometimes<br />\nintentional, sometimes not) which Chadbourne exploits whenever he can through<br />\nhis vocal style and in frequent instrumental \"commentaries\" on the vocal in<br />\nprogress. He translates the frustrations,<br />\nstruggles, self-chastisements, and pent-up<br />\nemotions he's singing about into sounds<br />\nand noises on the guitar. The band does<br />\nits best to concentrate all the musical<br />\nidiosyncrasies of country & western:<br />\ninstrumental fills or highlights which set<br />\noff the vocal line, galloping percussion,<br />\ntwangy sound, and sparse arrangements.<br />\nThe sense of humor is never malicious-these guys obviously like country music,<br />\nbut they're not about to take it seriously.<br />\nChadbourne solves the problem of<br />\nhow to direct and limit the \"freeness\" of<br />\nfree improvisation by using country &<br />\nwestern songs as points of departure and<br />\nguiding structures. The results are bizarre<br />\nbut always entertaining. In any case,<br />\nthey are just as adventurous as \"pure\"<br />\nimprovisation, and definitely a lot more<br />\nfun. The Chadbournes' music has proved<br />\nto be as popular among straight country<br />\n& western fans as among jazz and avantgarde aficionados--quite an accomplishment in itself.<br />\n<br />\nAn Insomniac's Guide To Gastritis<br />\nBY A.

The food is respectable but<br />\nnot superb, with a few favorite dishes<br />\nthat make the place both distinguishable<br />\nand special.<br />\nWhen Ghosts was first produced<br />\nIbsen was thought to have opened a can<br />\nof dramatic worms, for he made public<br />\nthat which was, for the Victorian, unspeakably private. Now, although we<br />\ncease to be shocked by what are sometimes termed \"sexually transmitted diseases,\" the play is still full of tension and<br />\ndrama that render the subject of venereal<br />\ndisease secondary to many other more<br />\nfundamental issues.<br />\nGhosts begins slowly\u2014as much<br />\nIbsen's fault as the actors'--as it sets up<br />\nand introduces the rest of the dramatic<br />\naction. Act I opens, after a brief foreshadowing view of the pivotal characters,<br />\nwith Mrs. Alving (Virginia Robinson) and<br />\nPastor Manders (Stanley Weiman)conversing. They are discussing plans for an<br />\norphanage which is to be erected in the<br />\nlate Mr. Alving's honor. During the<br />\ncourse of the conversation, the audience<br />\ndiscovers that things are not what they<br />\nseem and that the man to whom the<br />\norphanage is to be dedicated was really a<br />\n\"depraved profligate\" to the day he died.<br />\nDuring some well-executed moments of<br />\ndramatic interplay, Mrs. Alving reveals to<br />\nManders that she has sacrificed having her<br />\nson with her all these years to avoid a<br />\nrepetition of his father's decadence; she is<br />\ntrying to avoid the ghosts that haunt her.<br />\nDuring Act lithe action picks up<br />\nand there are further revelations. We find<br />\nthat the son. Osvald's return home is<br />\n<br />\ncaused by his inability to work\u2014something indicative of his illness. \"The sins<br />\nof the fathers are visited upon the children,\" Osvald says, and throughout the<br />\nplay we discover that this is true in a<br />\nvariety of ways. The past is inescapable.<br />\nGhosts has a number of complex<br />\nissues operating throughout, and the<br />\nactors, for the most part, do a credible<br />\njob with a fairly difficult play.<br />\nThe performances vary in quality.<br />\nRegina, played by Beth Rosner, a senior<br />\nat Hopkins, is the most monochromatic<br />\nof the actors. Her character is supposed<br />\nto be full of \"joi de vivre,\" and as such<br />\nshe plays her part well--she is full of<br />\nenergy and bounce. However, her characterization seems contrived at times and is<br />\noverdone.<br />\nRegina's father Engstrand, a clever, delightful old rogue whose limp and<br />\nmannerisms merely complement his deceptive innocence, is beautifully portrayed by Donald Hart. With his convincing accent and physical comportment, he<br />\nserves as especially satisfying comic relief.<br />\nThe leads' performances are char-<br />\n<br />\n,se<br />\n<br />\nacteristic of the quality of the play.<br />\nStanley Weiman's Pastor Manners, though<br />\nrespectable, is very unsympathetic, true<br />\nto lbsens dislike of the clergy. He is a<br />\nself-righteously pompous pastor who<br />\nblunders through life making a muck of it<br />\nbecause he is bound to the social conventions of the time. Like the play, Weiman<br />\nhas some superb moments, but at other<br />\ntimes he is unexciting. Weiman is very<br />\nfittingly pastor-like, and when he is not<br />\noverdoing it, is more than adequate.<br />\nSome of Weiman's best moments<br />\ncome in his interactions and conflicts<br />\nwith Virginia Robinson. The two wouldbe lovers occasionally hit their stride and<br />\nproduce some snappy dialogue and<br />\nexcellent theatre.<br />\nRobinson's own performance was<br />\nsatisfactory. She seems to have a set<br />\nrepertoire of emotions that she varies<br />\naccording to the situation. However, aft:<br />\na while, some of her actions become<br />\nrepetitive and ineffective. Her character's<br />\nemancipation from the evil of social<br />\nconformity should develop in accordance<br />\nwith the movement of the play, but by<br />\nthe third act a little of her freshness has<br />\nworn off.<br />\nShaun Greenleafs. rendering of<br />\nOsvald Alving begins much better than it<br />\nends.

Unfortunately,<br />\nmost of Act III is a \"veil of tears,\" and<br />\nthis undermines Osvald's formerly superb<br />\nperformance as a man tortured by his<br />\nheritage.<br />\nNone of the actors are aided by<br />\ntheir staging; this is one of the weakest<br />\naspects of the whole performance. The<br />\nset itself is tasteful, but the blocking is<br />\npoor. The actors often have their backs<br />\nand profiles to the audience. Admittedly,<br />\nthe Barn Theatre is badly designed, but<br />\noften the actors turn their backs on<br />\npurpose. They are (presumably) overcome by emotion or have something to<br />\nhide and therefore speak out the window,<br />\naway from the audience. Used sparingly,<br />\nthis device can be very effective; abused<br />\nas it is, it becomes intrusive, annoying,<br />\nand a cheap theatrical device that can<br />\ndegenerate into a cop-out for the actor.<br />\nGenerally, however, Ghosts is a<br />\njob well done. It is respectable, though<br />\nnot superb, and there are some striking<br />\nmoments. The play is performed sensitively and with a real understanding of<br />\nIbsen's work; the haunting themes of<br />\nintegrity, the past, the will to live and the<br />\nwill to die are all expressed, and the<br />\ncharacters are able for the most part to<br />\ninteract and form a cohesive whole.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 21 / NEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nA Guerilla Clash<br />\nBY TOM GRANT<br />\nThe bane of any countercultural<br />\ngenre is popularity, and this same commercial sickness has afflicted the field of<br />\nNew Wave. New Wave began as a statement of both alienation from an impersonal world and anger at this state of<br />\nalienation. Above all, New Wave was a<br />\nstatement; it transcended the superficiality of the trendy by making a sincere<br />\ncriticism of the status quo. Additionally,<br />\npart of New Wave's ideological appeal<br />\nrejection<br />\nfrom<br />\narose<br />\nits<br />\nof commercialism\u2014its musicians played in<br />\nsmall clubs rather than catering to the<br />\nmainstream norm of sardining a mob of<br />\nfans into the largest space possible; also,<br />\nNew Wave records were produced cheaply, and this combined with a reemergence<br />\nof the single allowed a greater number of<br />\nnew groups the opportunity to break into<br />\nthe field and produce and record their<br />\nown music. Lastly, New Wave has been<br />\ncharacterized by a primal, uncontrollable<br />\nenergy, ranging from the almost crazed<br />\nrock 'n' roll explosions of the Ramones<br />\nto the calculated fury of Elvis Costello.<br />\nIn many ways, the roots of New Wave are<br />\nsimilar to that of rock itself: raw, powerful, but sincere.<br />\nUnfortunately, the genre has<br />\nsuccumbed to the wiles of the record<br />\nindustry. New Wave has become fashionable, which has emasculated its purpose<br />\nand caused its decay. People who derided<br />\nthe field four years ago are now proclaiming themselves as what they believe to<br />\nbe \"punks\", but what they are really<br />\ndoing is listening to \"Rock Lobster\"<br />\nwhile wearing bizarre sunglasses. Not<br />\nonly has New Wave been misinterpreted<br />\nand trivialized, but markedly inferior<br />\ngroups such as Blondie and the B-52's<br />\n(who can hardly be seen as anything but a<br />\nnew style of party music) have overshadowed the genuine New Wave artists.<br />\nBut the Clash still has its finger on the,<br />\nadrenalin-fired pulse of New Wave, and<br />\nthe popularity which it has experienced<br />\nsince London Calling has not tempted it<br />\n<br />\ninto complete self-indulgence or sophomoricism. As.opposed to some groups<br />\n(such as the Sex Pistols) who.have taken<br />\nwild punches at the world, the scorn of<br />\nThe Clash is more refined: its members<br />\nknow not only how hard to strike, but<br />\nwhere society's weak points are. Much of<br />\nthe discontent of John Leyden and his<br />\nkin has been unrestrained fury (snarling,<br />\nscreaming, bashing, and spitting), but The<br />\nClash has been more successful in its<br />\nattacks because of its artful calculation<br />\nand incisive criticism. This was not<br />\nreadily apparent on The Clash's first<br />\nalbum, but Sandinista!, the group's<br />\nnewest release, combines this craftful<br />\ncriticism with a dash of innovation. Like<br />\nElvis Costello and the Attractions, The<br />\nClash has matured since its first efforts,<br />\nbut unlike Costello its members have<br />\nbroken away from the derivative R&B<br />\nsound of New Wave. Sandinista! is a<br />\nmyriad of sounds and styles, ranging from<br />\nthe reggae beat of \"Living in Fame\" to<br />\nthe slick American jazz flavor of \"Look<br />\nHere\". Sandinista! is full of experimentation:<br />\nthe background against which<br />\n\"Ivan Meets G.I. Joe\" is played is a<br />\ncacophony of the familiar bangs, whistles,<br />\ncrashes and explosions of arcade video<br />\ngames; \"Mensforth Hill\" and \"Silicon on<br />\nSapphire\" are bizarre amalgamations of<br />\nsynthesizer effects, spoken dialogue, and<br />\ndistorted music reminiscent of \"Revolution No. 9\".<br />\nFor an English group, the Clash<br />\ndeals with surprisingly American subject<br />\nmatter. The best example of this is \"The<br />\nCall-Up,\" a pointed anti-draft statement.<br />\n(\"It's up to you not to heed the call-up/<br />\nYou must not ask the way you were<br />\nbrought up... All the young people from<br />\ndown the ages/ Gladly marched off to<br />\ndie.\") Although this isn't quite Hemingway or Heller commenting on the terrible<br />\nnature of war, \"The Call-Up\" stands far<br />\nabove the rest of \"mainstream\" New<br />\nWave in both maturity and strength.

Some of the hardest<br />\nlie ahead. Like the one you're<br />\nfacing right now - how to<br />\nlaunch your career so that every<br />\nyear counts as a big one in<br />\npersonal and professional<br />\nachieyement. You want to look<br />\nback and say \"Now that was a<br />\ngood move.'<br />\nIt's your life and your future.<br />\nWhat does all this have to do<br />\nwith The BDM Corporation? A<br />\nlot. Because we have at least<br />\nsome of the answers you will<br />\nwant to consider ... answers to<br />\nquestions like these:<br />\n1.\"Where should I look for<br />\na career?\"<br />\nLook for a company that is corn<br />\nmitted to growth and has compiled an outstanding growth record to confirm that commitment.<br />\n(BDM has grown at a rate of 30% per<br />\nyear throughout the 1970s.)<br />\n2. \"Why is corporate growth so<br />\nimportant?\"<br />\nStrong corporate growth means that<br />\nthe opportunity for personal career<br />\ngrowth is much greater than in a more<br />\nstatic organization. (Graduates who<br />\njoined BDM two years ago have moved<br />\nfar ahead of their counterparts in most<br />\nother organizations.)<br />\n3. \"Why should I join a professional services company?\"<br />\nFor one reason, because ours has<br />\nbecome a sevice economy. A modem professional services company<br />\noffers greater opportunity, greater<br />\ndiversity, greater potential. (BDM<br />\ngives you the best of two worlds professional services growth plus a<br />\ncorporate focus on tomorrow's technology and systems.)<br />\n4.\"What are the most promising<br />\nfields in which to apply my technical skills?\"<br />\nNational defense, communications,<br />\n<br />\nThe Professionals We Seek<br />\nWe offer career opportunities to men<br />\nand women with degrees in:<br />\nENGINEERING<br />\n(especially EE, SE,and ChE)<br />\nAPPLIED PHYSICS<br />\nAPPLIED MATHEMATICS<br />\nCOMPUTER SCIENCE<br />\n(Scientific Applications)<br />\nOPERATIONS RESEARCH.<br />\nWe're looking for highly motivated<br />\npeople who want the challenge of<br />\nanalyzing and solving problems in<br />\ncommunications, software development,systems analysis,computer simu lation and modeling,laser physics and<br />\nengineering, electrb-optics, nuclear<br />\neffects, statistical test design, logistics,<br />\nelectronics, environmental sciences,<br />\neconomics and management sciences,<br />\nenergy production and distribution,and<br />\nrelated areas.<br />\n<br />\nThere will be a speaker from the<br />\nCHESAPEAKE ENERGY ALLIANCE, talking on nuclear power,<br />\nfollowing the regular business meeting of the YOUNG DEMOCRATS.<br />\nThe meeting will begin at 8:00 pm in<br />\nConference Room A on Tuesday,<br />\nMarch 5.<br />\nOn Tuesday, March 10, at 4:00<br />\npm in Remsen 221, Dr. Steve Harris<br />\nof General Motors Research Laboratories will give a seminar on Two<br />\nNew Laser Diagnostic Techniques for<br />\nCombustion Studies.<br />\nThe Core course in Sociophysiology<br />\nwill be showing Titticut Follies, a<br />\nfilm concerning life in a mental institution onMarch 6 at 1 p.m. in<br />\nShaffer 3.

Students can be<br />\nheard complaining about various<br />\naspects of this nebulous phenomenon, ranging from the pithy<br />\nfavorite, \"College Sucks,\" to<br />\nmove thoughtful comments on<br />\nthe quality, breadth and usefulness of an undergraduate<br />\neducation.<br />\nThe idea of an undergraduate education at Hopkins . is<br /><br />\nparticularly problematic because<br />\nthe University was initially conceived of as a graduate institution. Even in the misty realm of<br />\neducation one finds that distinctions between graduate and<br />\nundergraduate learning have<br />\nbeen made. Graduate students<br />\nare expected to be fairly independent, motivated and capable<br />\nof formulating their own ideas.<br />\nConversely, undergraduate students are conceived of as dependent quasi-adolescents who require support in fashioning their<br />\nthoughts and encouragement<br />\n(read: regimentation) in their<br />\nstudies.<br />\nIt would appear,<br />\ntherefore, that the type of<br />\ncont. on p. 6<br /><br />\nAn Oddly Human Document<br />\nWhat are intentions worth?<br />\nThe Judicial Code is an oddly human<br />\ndocument: it is full of contradictions,<br />\nflaws, and outright blunders; it has, underneath its semantic problems, a very wellintentioned drive to create some workable<br />\nsystem; and most important, its strengths<br />\nand weaknesses came from an ongoing<br />\nprocess of change.<br />\nAmong its many shortcomings:<br />\nThe people involved in a case can't<br />\nbring a lawyer with them when they appear<br />\nto argue the case.

Until<br />\n10 years ago Hopkins did the<br />\nsame, stressing its reputation<br />\nfirst as a research/graduate institution, and second as an undergraduate university. This emphasis was reflected in the<br />\nstudent body by a higher ratio<br />\nof graduates to undergraduates<br />\nas well as in the faculty, made<br />\nup primarily of professors interested in independent research.<br />\nHopkins was and is particularly<br />\nattractive to research-oriented<br />\nprofessors. Because the University pays faculty members for 9.<br />\nmonths (75 percent of the year),<br />\nJHU professors are free to<br />\nfollow their own interests; most<br />\nother research institutions however pay only 50 percent of<br />\none's salary, forcing a professor<br />\nto seek less creative but more<br />\nlucrative contracts from the<br />\ngovernment or private industry<br />\nto make up the difference.<br />\nTen years ago Hopkins<br />\nfound itself in serious financial<br />\ntroubles which jeopardized its<br />\nability to continue to offer an<br />\nindependent research environment. The following solution<br />\nwas proposed: bring in more<br />\nundergraduates to increase revenues, while keeping the number of faculty members, and<br />\ntherefore the costs, Fixed.<br />\nToday, as a result, we have a<br />\nlarger discontented undergraduate body, a relatively smaller<br />\nbeleagered faculty, and an administration trying to keep<br />\neverybody happy.<br />\nIt was and is a mistake to<br />\nadvertize Hopkins as a primarily<br />\nundergraduate institution. Although we do not lack all the<br />\namenities of \"undergraduate<br />\nlife,\" it is clear that if you<br />\nare looking for fun in the sun<br />\nyou'd be much happier at USC.<br />\nIf is also unfair for both faculty<br />\nmembers and students to saddle<br />\nthe latter with the 'bureaucratic<br />\nred tape attendent to undergraduate advising. It has been<br />\nmy experience that most professors are more than willing to<br />\ndiscuss the subject matter of a<br />\ncourse with a student, but<br />\npractically disappear during advising period when they are sure<br />\nto be barraged by add/drop<br />\nsheets and the like. A separation<br />\nof academic advising and administrative advising could,'with an<br />\nincrease in the administration<br />\nstaff, solve this problem.<br />\nHopkins as an undergraduate institution can be made a<br />\nmore effective environment by<br />\nstressing the school's inherent<br />\nstrengths rather than putting a<br />\nstrain on its resources. Recruiters should describe JHU as it<br />\nreally is: a research university<br />\nthat places a multitude of<br />\nresources at the disposal of all of<br />\nits students to make use of as<br />\nthey see fit. Not all undergraduates seek undergrad utopia<br />\nor post high school preparation.<br />\nMany would do well in an<br /><br />\nindependent atmosphere, and<br />\nwould probably appreciate their<br />\neducations more if they get what<br />\nthey expected, and not some<br />\nwatered-down compromise.<br />\nGranted, as college admissions continue to decline across<br />\nthe country, it might be hard<br />\nfor universities to maintain enrollment. Nevertheless, I suspect<br />\nthat while fewer people will be<br />\nenrolling in college, those who<br />\nmatriculate will be doing so to<br />\nget an education and not a four<br />\n(or five) year all-expenses-paid<br />\nvacation. By emphasizing its<br />\nstrengths, Hopkins would have a<br />\nhappier faculty and student<br />\nbody, and begin to realize its<br />\npotential in the bargain.<br />\nI would like to thank Dr.<br />\nMichael Karweit, and Dr.<br />\nStanley Corrison indirectly for<br />\ntheir thoughts on education at<br />\nHopkins.<br /><br />\ncont. from p. 5<br />\nin my opinion, would be to<br />\nplace student government under<br />\na \"sunset law\", similar to that<br />\nwhich exists in many states.<br />\nWhat it would mean would be<br />\nthat the student council would<br />\nhave to justify its existence to<br />\nthe student body every year by a<br />\nreferendum. If the referendum<br />\npassed, the council would continue in existence and know that<br />\nat least half of the student<br />\nsupport them or at least the<br />\nprograms they administer.

Wilson Shaffer: A Man For All Seasons<br />\nBY STEPHANIE REYNOLDS<br />\nGeorge Wilson Shaffer first<br />\ncame to Hopkins as an undergraduate in 1920. Over the next<br />\n60 years, he served as professor,<br />\nathletic director, and dean.<br />\nThough retired since 1967, Dr.<br />\nShaffer (his friends call him<br />\nWilson) still maintains an office<br />\nin the basement of Homewood<br />\nHouse. Unknown to all but a<br />\nhandful of students, he remains<br />\nbeloved to those who worked<br />\nwith him.<br />\nShaffer was born in Baltimore on November 23, 1901.<br />\nAfter graduating from high<br />\nschool at Baltimore City College,<br />\nhe entered Hopkins at the start<br />\nof the Roaring Twenties. Despite student years which included making bathtub gin and<br />\ntaking part in an illegal bonfire,<br />\nShaffer received an A.B. in 1924<br />\nand a Ph.D. in 1928 in Psychology. The library holds several<br />\ncopies of his Ph.D. thesis, titled<br />\nAlertness and Motor Abilities of<br />\nAthletes and Non-Athletes. After working for several years at<br />\nShepphard and Enoch Pratt<br />\nHospital as a clinical psychologist, Shaffer returned to Hopkins<br />\nas a professor in 1934.<br />\nThe chairman of the Psychology Department, at the time,<br />\nwas leaving on sabbatical and<br />\nShaffer took over teaching his<br />\ncourses. That year, Shaffer also<br />\nbecame athletic director and<br />\nstarted a revolutionary new<br />\nprogram there. In 1937,Shaffer<br />\ncreated the psychological clinic<br />\nlater to be called the White<br />\nHouse. By 1942, Shaffer was<br />\nDean of the College of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\nAs athletic director, Shaffer<br />\ninstituted reforms in the Physical Education Department suggested by University President<br />\nJoseph Ames. According to<br />\nShaffer, Ames was profoundly<br />\ninfluenced by a statement made<br />\nby the Carnegie Foundation<br />\nwhich deplored the commercialism of college athletics. In an<br />\ninterview last week, Shaffer<br />\ndescribed the athletics reforms<br />\nin this way:<br />\nDr. Ames, who was then the<br />\nPresident, decided that college<br />\nathletics was too commercialized, that we were paying<br />\nattention to the people who<br />\nwere the stars and he appointed<br />\na committee to do something<br />\nabout it. Up to that point, the<br />\nathletics had been run by an<br />\nalumnus and the committee decided that it should he run by a<br />\nmember of the faculty. I was<br />\ninterested enough and was the<br />\nonly member of the faculty who<br />\nhad ever been a professional<br />\nathlete, so I drew the task...<br />\nThey decided that they would<br />\ndrop football which was considered really the thing and focus<br />\nprimarily on the intramural<br />\nprogram. The budget for the<br />\nyear was $21,000. That was to<br />\ninclude salaries. And I immedianew<br />\nfive<br />\nadded<br />\ntely<br />\nsoccer,.<br />\nsports\u2014fencing,<br />\nwrestling, golf, and brought<br />\nhack baseball, which had been in<br />\nthe earlier history, hut disappeared for a long time.<br />\nShaffer solved the budget<br />\nproblem in the Physical Educa-<br /><br />\ntion Department by giving grad- money in. These were competiuate scholarships to three Hop- tive games, so they would hire a<br />\nkins students in return for their pitcher. We got most of the<br />\ncoaching talents. After this first money from the hat.<br />\nShaffer also signed a conyear, football was de-emphasized<br />\nand admission was no longer tract to play professional basecharged for games. A physical ball with the New York Giants.<br />\neducation program was required He practiced with the team for<br />\ntwo weeks, but never actually<br />\nof all freshmen:<br />\nWe used the use the first sem- played because, in order to start<br />\nester primarily to let the boys spring training in February, he<br />\nget to know each other some- would have had to drop out of<br />\nwhere outside the classroom; we high school:<br /><br />\nused soccer and touch football.<br />\nBut we did manage to teach<br />\nthem all at least one carry-over<br />\nsport. They had to either play<br />\nsome tennis, badminton, golf or<br />\nhandball because my assumption<br />\nwas, at the time, that, when you<br />\nfinished college, you would have<br />\ntrouble finding 40 boys to play<br />\nsoccer or lacrosse with, hut you<br />\ncould go out with one other<br />\nperson and get recreation. The<br />\nPhysical education requirement<br />\nfor freshmen was eliminated in<br />\nthe Sixties:<br />\nThat was one of the mistakes of<br />\nthe '60's. During the last '60's,<br />\nthat was a couple ofyears after I<br />\nretired, a small number of boys<br />\ncomplained that they didn't<br />\nwant to take physical education... Faculties and administrators in the late '60's and early<br />\n'70's were very scared of the<br />\nstudents. In various places, they<br />\nwere burning downhuildings and<br />\nso somebody complained, they<br />\nrelaxed and gave in. I guess ifI<br />\nhad still been there, I would not<br />\nhave gone for it and I might have<br />\nbeen tarred and feathered.<br />\nThe reform of the physical<br />\neducation program at Hopkins<br />\nwas noted across the country<br />\nand adopted by other small,<br />\nEastern universities.<br />\nShaffer's interest in athletics<br />\nhas been lifelong. Starting at the<br />\nage of fifteen, he worked for the<br />\nMaryland Department of Recreation. On Sundays, he played<br />\nbaseball as a pitcher:<br />\nIn the summertime, on Sundays,<br />\nI would go to the'\"little parks.\"<br />\nThey had baseball games with<br />\nno fences around them so they<br />\ncouldn't charge admission. The<br />\ncrowd stood around and at some<br />\ntime a fellow would go around<br />\nwith a hat and you'd drop some<br /><br />\nBy that time, I had injured the<br />\nmiddle finger on my right hand<br />\nand, as you can see, I'm not big<br />\nenough to he any Jim Palmer. I<br />\ndidn't have a speedball. I didn't<br />\neven have a good curve.<br />\nBecause of strict rules on<br />\namateur competition, Shaffer<br />\nwas not permitted to play<br />\nbaseball after his freshman year<br />\nin high school or in college. He<br />\nwas determined, however, to<br />\nencourage athletics for the<br />\ngreatest number of students at<br />\nHopkins, once he became Director of Athletics.<br />\nIn 1937, Shaffer organized<br />\nthe psychological clinic:<br />\nIn an earlier period of time,<br />\npeople were very hesitant to<br />\ncome and talk about emotional<br />\nproblems. If you had an appendectomy, you'd want to show<br />\nthe scar, but not if it was a<br />\nmental problem...So when Ifirst<br />\nagreed to see the people, I<br />\npurposely arranged an office<br />\naway from the academic office.<br />\nBut I had other things going on<br />\nin that area so that while they<br />\ncame in, no one would no what<br />\nthey were there for. Directly<br />\nafter the war, they came in such<br />\nnumbers and perfectly willing to<br />\naccept the fact that that's what<br />\nthey were doing there, that I had<br />\nto get help. I started by getting<br />\njust one psychiatrist from the<br />\nPhipps Clinic, then added two<br />\nclinical psychologists from the<br />\nPsychology Department. And<br />\nby the time I gave up the clinic<br />\nto Dr. Godenne, we had six<br />\nyoung psychiatrists from Phipps<br />\nand Shapphard Pratt and six<br />\nsenior psychiatrists from the<br />\nsame two places.<br /><br />\nShaffer combined the different roles of adminstrator and<br />\nwithout conflict.<br />\ncounselor<br />\nWhen describing him, Shaffer's<br />\nassociates at Hopkins usually<br />\nnote how much he helped the<br />\nstudents. Dr. Lee Park, who<br />\nworked with him in counseling<br />\nthrough the '60's, comments, \"I<br />\nthink what impressed me most<br />\nabout him was his brilliance as<br />\nadministrator, confidante, counselor, and teacher. Students<br /><br />\nwere always able to trust him.\"<br />\nBob Scott, now Athletic Director, described Shaffer as \"the<br />\nman behind the scenes,\"in athletics. \"A number of coaches<br />\nhave consulted with him. Probably, there hasn't been anyone<br />\nat Hopkins who contributed<br />\nmore to students or was more<br />\nwilling to help students,\" Scott<br />\nsays.<br />\nIrene Davis Corwin was<br />\nRegistrar most of the time<br />\nShaffer was Dean. She also<br />\nknew him when they were both<br />\nstudents. Corwin says, because<br />\nof the smaller undergraduate<br />\npopulation, \"we knew a great<br />\nmany of the students personalAccording to Corwin,<br />\nly.\"<br />\nShaffer summed up her concept<br />\nof Hopkins because he had been<br />\nundergraduate, graduate student,<br />\nteacher, and administrator.<br />\nHaving been a student at<br />\nHopkins himself, Shaffer had a<br />\ngreater empathy for students<br />\nthan other administrators might<br />\nhave. In March and April of<br />\n1976, a lecture series on the<br />\nhistory of Hopkins was presented by the Evening College and<br />\nSession and the<br />\nSummer<br />\nCEntennial Committee in honor<br />\nof Hopkins' centennial celebration. Shaffer gave the first<br />\nlecture in the building on<br />\ncampus named for him. In this<br />\nsppech, Shaffer described some<br />\nof his adventures as a student at<br />\nHopkins during the '20's:<br />\nMy frat house, a three-story<br />\nhouse, had baths on the second<br />\nand third stories. You took a<br />\nbath on the second floor. In the<br />\nthird floor bathroom, we made<br />\ngin.<br />\nOne of Shaffer's exploits as<br />\na student came back to haunt<br /><br />\nhim as an administrator:<br />\nThe students used to have<br />\nbonfires the night before the big<br />\nfootball games. On one of these<br />\noccasions, I was in the fraternity<br />\npalying bridge and a freshman<br />\ncame in, almost in tears, saying<br />\n\"They won't let us light the fire;<br />\nthe firemen and policemen are<br />\ndown there.\" Well, it turned out<br />\nthat three of us got in a little<br />\nautomobile, one on the top with<br />\nsome wood and shacings and<br />\nsome gasoline and drove straight<br />\nup to the fire, shoved it off the<br />\ntop and there was a terrific<br />\nblaze. Some 25 years later,<br />\nwhile I was serving as Dean,<br />\nsome students came to see me<br />\nand said, \"We'd like to have a<br />\nbonfire before the game.\" I<br />\nsaid, \"Well, it's all right with me,<br />\nbut you know the regulations<br />\nare that you have to have<br />\napermit from the fire department.\" So the boys went down<br />\nto the fire department to get the<br />\npermit and the chief came out to<br />\nsee me and he wanted to know,<br />\n\"Where is the fire going to be?\"<br />\nHe wanted to go down and look<br />\nat the amount of wood that was<br />\nthere and how close it was to the<br />\nbuildings. And I drove him<br />\ndown and he looked at it and I<br />\nwill not tell you the indelicate<br />\nexpression that he used when he<br />\nsaid to me I could ... this fire out<br />\nmyself. Then he said, \"111 tell<br />\nyou what used to happen down<br />\nhere\u2014Do you know that about<br />\n25 years ago they had this...\"<br />\nAnd he went through the whole<br />\nbusiness of this thing and I have<br />\nto confess that I didn't have the<br />\ncourage to tell him at the time<br />\nthat I was a part of that situation.<br />\nWhen Shaffer becaome<br />\nDean of the College of Arts and<br />\nSciences, administration was a<br />\nmuch smaller operation than it is<br />\nnow.<br />\nThe President, the<br />\nProvost, and the Deans of<br />\nEngineering and Arts and<br />\nSciences made up all of the<br />\nadministration. Shaffer attributes the smaller scale to a<br />\nsmaller undergraduate population and to the lack of government regulation at that time.<br />\nBefore World War II, undergraduates numbered under 1,000;<br />\nnow there are about 2,500. Not<br />\nonly was the undergraduate<br />\npopulation smaller in absolute<br />\nnumbers, but relative to the<br />\nnumber of graduate students, it<br />\nwas also smaller:<br />\nOne of the real characteristics of this place had always been<br />\nthat the undergraduate population, in terms of number, never<br />\noverpowered the graduate students. It's probably the only<br />\nuniversity in the country where<br />\nthat was true.<br />\nUnlike most 19th-century<br />\ncolleges, Hopkins was founded<br />\nprimarily as a graduate school, in<br />\nthe tradition of European universities.<br />\nThe undergraduate<br />\nCollege of Arts and Sciences was<br />\nmaintained to insure a pool of<br />\nqualified applicants for the<br />\ngraduate programs. The number<br />\nof graduate students began to<br />\ndecline when government agencies began to subsidize undergraduate education during the<br />\ncont. on p. 11<br /><br />\nPAGE 10 / MARCH 6, 1981<br />\n\u20220-0 *<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER CLASSIFIED<br /><br />\nWEDNEJDATNOON-3ERIE3<br />\nPresented by The Johns Hopkins University Office of Special Events<br /><br />\nTRUCKS<br />\nCARS,<br />\nJEEPS,<br />\navailable through government<br />\nsell<br />\nfor<br />\nmany<br />\nunder<br />\nagencies,<br />\n$200.00.

During that<br />\ntime, private foundations reduced their subsidization of graduate students. Federal and state<br />\ngrants often required that<br />\nmatching funds be raised and<br />\nthat also be used for undergraduate education. Along with<br />\ngovernment aid came government regulation. Much more<br />\nelaborate records were required<br />\nby government agencies. One<br />\nprofessor has described the University as \"a microcosm\u2014a<br />\nreflection of the world in which<br />\nwe live\u2014where we have to<br />\nquasi-judicial<br />\nanswer<br />\nto<br />\nagencies\u2014 Big Brother.\"<br />\nMuch of this transformation<br />\ntook place while Shaffer was<br />\nDean at Hopkins. In 1948, he<br />\nassumed the newly-created post<br />\nof Dean of the Homewood<br />\nAt that time, the<br />\nSchools.<br />\nposition of Dean of the Evening<br />\nCollege was also instituted. Not<br />\nuntil 1959 was a Dean of Students named.<br /><br />\nAs the number of undergraduate students began to rise,<br />\nan admissions office became<br />\nnecessary. Before 1956, admissions were handled first through<br />\nthe office of the President and<br />\nlater through Shaffer's office as<br />\nDean of the Homewood Schools.<br />\nAlso before 1956, there<br />\nwere no set requirements for the<br />\nundergraduate<br />\nA.B. degree.<br />\nby<br />\nStudents were guided<br />\nShaffer, but never knew exactly<br />\nwhere they stood. Under the<br />\nsupervision of the new president<br />\nof the University, Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower, Shaffer set up the<br />\nprogram essentially still required. Also under Eisenhower's<br />\npresidency, Shaffer set up the<br />\nGraduate Board, which still<br />\nsupervises the awarding of<br />\nPh.D.'s.<br />\nDr. Eisenhower has<br />\ndescribed Shaffer's role as \"indispensable to me, during my<br />\nfirst presidency from 1956 to<br />\n1967.\" Both Eisenhower and<br />\nShaffer retired in 1967, though<br />\nEisenhower returned for a<br /><br />\nten-month interim presidency<br />\nin 1971, up to the selection of<br />\nStephen Muller as President, by<br />\nthe Board of Trustees.<br />\nThroughout his career at<br />\nHopkins, Shaffer taught at least<br />\ntwo psychology courses per<br />\nyear. His graduate and undergraduate abnormal psychology<br />\ncourses were always popular.<br />\nThough the undergraduate version generally attracted about<br />\ntwo hundred students, Shaffer<br />\ngraded all of the exams and<br />\nOne of the<br />\npapers himself.<br />\nattractions of the course was<br />\nShaffer's demonstration of hypnosis, a field which always<br />\ninterested him.<br />\nShaffer also taught a course<br />\ncalled \"Autobiographical Study<br />\nof Personality\" in which the six<br />\nto eight students enrolled wrote<br />\nautobiographies.<br />\nlengthy<br />\nShaffer has kept the longest<br />\none, which is more than 450<br />\npages. In his abnormal psychology courses, students were<br />\noften required to write shorter<br /><br />\nautobiographies:<br />\nI think that there was hardly a<br />\npre-medical student or a student<br />\nwho was going to take graduate<br />\nwork in clinical psychology who<br />\ndid not take that course. I<br />\nassigned a short autobiography<br />\nin there and I had a laugh with<br />\nsome people, some ten years<br />\nago, on the staff of the Phipps<br />\nClinic. I told them, \"I have the<br />\nautobiography of almost every<br />\none of you.\" A number of<br />\nthe boys, most of them are out<br />\npracticing psychiatry or clinical<br />\npsychology\u2014they write and say,<br />\n\"This is the most useful thing I<br />\never did in my education.\"<br />\nShaffer has written two textbooks, Abnormal Psychology<br />\nand Fundamental Concepts in<br />\nClinical Psychology, both in<br />\ncollaboration with other professors, More recently, he has<br />\nwritten Recreation and Athletics<br />\nat Johns Hopkins: A One-Hundred\u2014 Year-History.<br />\nFriends and associates of<br />\nShaffer usually mention his<br /><br />\nsense of humor. He was noted<br />\nfor a lecture he gave many times<br />\ncalled \"The Psychology of<br />\nHumor,\" a study of various<br />\ntypes of humor, which Shaffer<br />\ndemonstrated by giving examples.<br />\nShaffer's style of administration was much more relaxed<br />\nand personal that later administration could be. Robert Roy,<br />\nDean Emeritus of the Engineering School, says Shaffer \"never<br />\nwas mandatory or dictatorial.<br />\nThe general rule around Hopkins<br />\nwas that the various positions<br />\nhad a tremendous degree of<br />\nautonomy. All of the administrators had enormous dedication.\" Eisenhower had described Shaffer as the \"academic<br />\n'troubleshooter\" of the school.<br />\nEdward McDill, chairman of the<br />\nSocial Relations Department,<br />\ncalls Shaffer \"a man for all<br />\nseasons with the ability to bring<br />\nout the best in people and a<br />\ngreat insight into people's behavior.\"<br /><br />\nPAGE 12/ MARCH 6. 1981<br /><br />\nDraft Of The Johns Hopkins University<br />\nUndergraduate Judicial Code<br /><br />\nI.

Devlin catches it and fires the<br />\nball at the goal, all in the same motion. With a deft<br />\nmovement of his oversized stick, Hopkins netminder<br />\nBrian Holman spears the speeding bullet out of midair.<br />\nImmediately looking downfield, he lofts a<br />\nlooping pass to defenseman Dave Black. Black cradles<br />\nthe ball in his stick several times before spotting Blue<br />\nJay midfielder Joe Ciletti racing toward the midfield<br />\nstripe. Black's perfect pass doesn't cause his former high<br />\nschool teammate to break stride. Hopkins is off and<br />\nrunning.<br />\nAs the three Blue Jay attackmen see the fast<br />\nbreak opportunity develop, they drop back and set up<br />\nclose to the Yale goal. When a Yale defender leaves his<br />\nman to cover the hard-charging Ciletti,-the Hopkins<br />\njunior passes the ball to attackman Jeff Harris.<br />\nIn one graceful motion, Harris catches the ball<br />\njust above his left shoulder, wheels to his right, and fires<br />\na blazing shot into the upper right-hand corner of the<br />\ngoal. A split second later the Hopkins rooting section<br />\nyells its approval.<br />\nElapsed time: 25 seconds. The sport: lacrosse!<br />\nMarch 14 marks the unofficial 89th celebration<br />\nof the rites of spring at Hopkins. For on the Homewood<br />\ncampus, spring is synonymous with lacrosse.

Fifteen to twenty-five<br />\ngoals are commonly scored, and in my view lacrosse<br />\ncontains the best elements of football, basketball,<br />\nsoccer, and hockey.\"<br />\nThe fastest game on two feet (hockey is played<br />\non skates), lacrosse is an exciting and invigorating game<br />\nwhich is fun to watch and to play. At its best, the sport<br />\ncombines the body contact of Stanley Cup hockey with<br />\nthe agility, grace, and quickness of NBA basketball.<br /><br />\nBob Ott, a former star midfielder at Maryland,<br />\ncalled lacrosse \"a jumble of all games. I enjoy the<br />\nviolence like football. There is plenty of free running<br />\nlike soccer. The play around the goal is much like<br />\nbasketball, and the stick makes it like hockey.\"<br />\nLacrosse was invented by North American<br />\nIndians. They employed wooden sticks with a netted<br />\nloop at one end and a ball made of wood or of deerskin<br />\nfilled with animal hair. As many as a-thousand warriors<br />\nin full war paint played on a field several miles long<br />\nwithout sidelines. Games lasted two or three days and<br />\ndefeat sometimes meant death.<br />\nFrenchmen named the game la crosse because the<br />\nIndians' sticks reminded them of a crosier, a long staff<br />\nresembling a shepherd's crook usually carried by bishops<br />\nas a symbol of office. The Indians used the game to<br />\ncondition their young braves for battle. Often tribal<br />\nmedicine men served as \"game officials.\"<br />\nThe Europeans who came to the New World<br />\ngreatly reduced the number of participants in a contest.<br />\nHowever, they preserved the essential idea of trying to<br />\nthrow a ball into a goal defended by one's enemies,<br />\nwhile protecting one's own goal from violation. All<br />\nthrowing and catching was still done with a curved,<br />\nnetted stick.<br />\nThe modern game of lacrosse is played on a<br />\nrectangular field, 110 yards long and 60 yards wide.<br />\nGoals consist of netted six-foot squares 80 yards apart.<br />\nPlayers frequently carry the ball behind the cage to set<br />\nup offensive plays, since the goals are positioned 15<br />\nyards from the endlines.<br />\nPlayers wear uniforms consisting of helmets with<br />\na metal face mask, hockey-style gloves, arm pads, and<br />\nfrequently shoulder pads.

This year, the Elis receive new blood from<br />\nCoach Mike Waldvogel, whose position as an assistant on<br />\nRichie Morans Cornell squad has brought the Big Red<br />\nmuch success. Ciccarone: With a new coach they<br />\nshould be able to improve on last years record relying on<br />\nthe strength of their returnees. They have recruited a<br />\nnumber of football players to give speed and strength if<br />\nnot lacrosse savvy. They will need a few years to rebuild.

Last years score: 13-3,16-2(QF). Last<br />\nyears record: (11-3). The Jays return for their third<br />\nconsecutive performance in the Day of Champions at<br />\nManhasset. This years opponent, the Harvard Crimson,<br />\nwill probably be one of the toughest games the Big Blue<br />\nhas ever played on the Island. After winning the Ivy<br />\nLeague title last season, the Crimson was handed two of<br />\nits three defeats at the hands of Hopkins. Returning 18<br />\nlettermen, including the phenomenal freshman Brendan<br />\nMeagher, whose four goals and one assist in the NCAA<br />\nquarter finals against the Jays made him the unanimous<br />\nchoice for the 1980 Peter Banker Award, given by<br />\nHopkins to the best opposing player of the year. C-ccaronP: Harvard will probably be the most dangerous<br />\nteam we will face.

After their surprising finish last year, they<br />\nare certainly a dangerous team. Although we don't<br />\nknow about their recruits of the new season we will look<br />\nfor them to be strong.

Army: Last year's score: 11-10.<br /><br />\nLast year's record: 84. Last year's game against the<br />\nBlack Knights was almost the year's biggest disaster for<br />\nthe Jays. Ahead 9-5, the Jays allowed the Cadets to<br />\nfight back to a 10-10 tie. Goalie Mike Federico held<br />\ntight in the goal however, and the Hopkins squad eked it<br />\nout 11-10. This year, with home field advantage and<br />\nwithout goalie Kevin MacGibbon, the Knights may fall<br />\nprey to the power of the Blue. Ciccarone: We were<br />\nlucky to get away with a win last year? they aren't a<br />\nteam to play if you want to look good. Strengths:<br />\nDefenders Bob Henry, Pete Hillebrand, middie Ed<br />\nBollenbacher and attacker Frank Gordiano. Weaknesses:<br />\nLoss of goalie MacGibbon.<br />\nAPRIL 25<br />\n2:00 P.M.

The loss of coach Buddy Beardmore to business may hurt the team, but his successor,<br />\nformer Maryland star and University of Baltimore coach<br />\nDino Mattessich, will have a good base of operations<br />\nwith his returning talent. Ciccarone: Maryland has<br />\nrecruited a good group of junior college players this<br />\nyear. Their fall lacrosse program was described as one.<br />\nthat had a lot of hustle, something many Maryland<br />\nteams haven't relied on. Last year I felt that they were<br />\nthe team that could dethrone us, but their season was<br />\ndisastrous with the final loss to University of Baltimore.<br />\nIf the team can recover from that, they will be tough<br />\nthis year.

Their<br />\nability to scar a perfect Homecoming weekend is proven,<br />\nbut this game won't be one to miss. .Ciccarone: The<br />\nteam's offense looks solid, but they might have some<br />\nimprovement with the loss of Mike Buzzell. If Buzzell<br />\nwas neutralized, the whole team offense could be shut<br />\ndown. Now, with Mike gone, the team may spread the<br />\noffensive chores around. Strengths: Syd Abernathy and<br />\nRich Wellman may dominate the new attack, while<br />\ngoalies Scott Bartkowski and Pat Brannigan look sharp.<br />\nWeaknesses:.

They<br />\nare the white man's blues--bittersweet<br />\nLaments based on recurring themes<br />\nand situations (symbols?): women, bars,<br />\nmotels, hard work, jail, the good life,<br />\nescape. They often contain an undercurrent of maudlin humor (sometimes<br />\nintentional, sometimes not) which Chadbourne exploits whenever he can through<br />\nhis vocal style and in frequent instrumental \"commentaries\" on the vocal in<br />\nprogress. He translates the frustrations,<br />\nstruggles, self-chastisements, and pent-up<br />\nemotions he's singing about into sounds<br />\nand noises on the guitar.

The night had an authentic atmosphere because the only people awake<br />\nwere the mysterious Night People,<br />\nwho shun the daylight hours.<br />\nCollege has changed all this. Now<br />\nswarms of willful insomniacs invade the<br />\nnight, adulterating the very atmosphere<br />\nthey hope to find preserved in the odd<br />\ncorners and back streets of town.<br />\nIt's too late to turn the tide. We<br />\ncan't give Manhattan back to the Indians.<br />\nInstead we must come to grips with an<br />\nimportant truth; these willful insomniacs<br />\nare here to stay, and we often get very<br />\nhungry early in the morning.<br />\nTake last Tuesday for instance. It<br />\nwas 1:57 a.m. WaWa's had long since<br />\npacked away the last chocolate donut,<br />\nand the Scottish fellow at the Grad Club<br />\ninsisted the counter was closed. There<br />\nwas nothing at home but a box of ButterBuds and carton of milk from last semester. W hat to do?<br />\nI was tired of frozen pizza and<br /><br />\nSteward Sandwiches from the all-night<br />\n7-11, and I couldn't face Little Tavern.<br />\nPutting on my long-johns, I considered<br />\nmy situation-I needed money, a car,<br />\nand company, in that order. Trusty<br />\ncomrades Walt and Joe were roused from<br />\nslumber and quickly enlightened of my<br />\npurpose. By 2:30 a.m. we were speeding<br />\nthrough deserted streets in search of<br />\ncoffee.<br />\nFirst stop: The Open House at<br />\n29th and Maryland Avenue. This was a<br />\npleasant surprise, a breakfast and burger<br />\nplace set in an old one-room stone<br />\nbuilding, advertising two to the very<br /><br />\nslogans we searched for--\"We Never<br />\nClose\", and (better still) \"Breakfast<br />\nserved anytime\".<br />\nBeyond these two essential attractions, the Open House offered nothing<br />\nmore extraordinary than decent coffee at<br />\n35 cents, fair pancakes, and subs fea_<br /><br />\nturing haddock and crab meat. The<br />\ncrowd was sleepy and unthreatening--surprisingly few student-types for a place so<br />\nclose to Mother Hopkins. But, as we<br />\nwere to learn over the course of our<br />\nodyssey, respectable mediocrity can be an<br />\noutstanding quality in a night restaurant.<br />\nHaving shared one plate of hotcakes, one cheeseburger sub (ugh) and a<br />\ncup of coffee between the three of us<br />\n(the waiter thought we were taking<br />\nsacrament together), we were well gassed<br />\nup when we headed for the car. The next<br />\nstop was Steak'n'Eggs on York Road.<br />\nOne might ask, as we did, just<br />\nwhat sort of creature a \"N'egg\" is. We<br />\nnever found out, but the engima of the<br />\nN'eggery operated subtly on our digestion<br />\nthe whole 20 minutes we were there.<br />\nWalt, Joe and I split a ham omlette,<br />\npapery home fries, and a foul cup of.<br />\ncoffee. I wished I'd been more adventurous back home with the Butter Buds.<br />\nWhile we ate, an obese, pallid man in a<br />\nblack suit and string tie smiled at us. His<br />\ngrin followed us to the car, and out of the<br />\nlot until we passed out of sight. He may<br />\nbe smiling still.<br />\nWe headed south on York-Greenmount, destined for Leon's Pig Pen.<br />\nAlong the road, the row houses grew<br />\nincreasingly decrepit. The shop windows<br />\nlooked like prison cells; the buildings,<br />\nlike post-holocaust bomb shelters. Our<br />\nstomachs were gurgling, hoping for more<br /><br />\nmunchies, when we passed a White Tower<br />\nat 27th and Greenmount.<br />\nJoe insisted we stop, having a dire<br />\nneed to relieve himself, so despite my<br />\nreservations, we entered. A wall of<br />\nstaring eyes met us at the door, and all<br />\ntalking stopped. Apparently the White<br />\nTower was the community's usual<br />\ngathering place, for despite the hour, the<br />\nplace was packed. The customers soon<br />\nrqumed their joking and chatting. Of all<br />\nthe places we visited, this one was the<br />\nmost alive, its patrons the most good<br />\nhumored.

While a good classic is always<br />\ncontemporary, the reverse is not always<br />\ntrue.

New Wave began as a statement of both alienation from an impersonal world and anger at this state of<br />\nalienation. Above all, New Wave was a<br />\nstatement; it transcended the superficiality of the trendy by making a sincere<br />\ncriticism of the status quo. Additionally,<br />\npart of New Wave's ideological appeal<br />\nrejection<br />\nfrom<br />\narose<br />\nits<br />\nof commercialism\u2014its musicians played in<br />\nsmall clubs rather than catering to the<br />\nmainstream norm of sardining a mob of<br />\nfans into the largest space possible; also,<br />\nNew Wave records were produced cheaply, and this combined with a reemergence<br />\nof the single allowed a greater number of<br />\nnew groups the opportunity to break into<br />\nthe field and produce and record their<br />\nown music. Lastly, New Wave has been<br />\ncharacterized by a primal, uncontrollable<br />\nenergy, ranging from the almost crazed<br />\nrock 'n' roll explosions of the Ramones<br />\nto the calculated fury of Elvis Costello.<br />\nIn many ways, the roots of New Wave are<br />\nsimilar to that of rock itself: raw, powerful, but sincere.<br />\nUnfortunately, the genre has<br />\nsuccumbed to the wiles of the record<br />\nindustry. New Wave has become fashionable, which has emasculated its purpose<br />\nand caused its decay. People who derided<br />\nthe field four years ago are now proclaiming themselves as what they believe to<br />\nbe \"punks\", but what they are really<br />\ndoing is listening to \"Rock Lobster\"<br />\nwhile wearing bizarre sunglasses. Not<br />\nonly has New Wave been misinterpreted<br />\nand trivialized, but markedly inferior<br />\ngroups such as Blondie and the B-52's<br />\n(who can hardly be seen as anything but a<br />\nnew style of party music) have overshadowed the genuine New Wave artists.<br />\nBut the Clash still has its finger on the,<br />\nadrenalin-fired pulse of New Wave, and<br />\nthe popularity which it has experienced<br />\nsince London Calling has not tempted it<br /><br />\ninto complete self-indulgence or sophomoricism. As.opposed to some groups<br />\n(such as the Sex Pistols) who.have taken<br />\nwild punches at the world, the scorn of<br />\nThe Clash is more refined: its members<br />\nknow not only how hard to strike, but<br />\nwhere society's weak points are. Much of<br />\nthe discontent of John Leyden and his<br />\nkin has been unrestrained fury (snarling,<br />\nscreaming, bashing, and spitting), but The<br />\nClash has been more successful in its<br />\nattacks because of its artful calculation<br />\nand incisive criticism. This was not<br />\nreadily apparent on The Clash's first<br />\nalbum, but Sandinista!, the group's<br />\nnewest release, combines this craftful<br />\ncriticism with a dash of innovation. Like<br />\nElvis Costello and the Attractions, The<br />\nClash has matured since its first efforts,<br />\nbut unlike Costello its members have<br />\nbroken away from the derivative R&amp;B<br />\nsound of New Wave. Sandinista! is a<br />\nmyriad of sounds and styles, ranging from<br />\nthe reggae beat of \"Living in Fame\" to<br />\nthe slick American jazz flavor of \"Look<br />\nHere\". Sandinista! is full of experimentation:<br />\nthe background against which<br />\n\"Ivan Meets G.I. Joe\" is played is a<br />\ncacophony of the familiar bangs, whistles,<br />\ncrashes and explosions of arcade video<br />\ngames; \"Mensforth Hill\" and \"Silicon on<br />\nSapphire\" are bizarre amalgamations of<br />\nsynthesizer effects, spoken dialogue, and<br />\ndistorted music reminiscent of \"Revolution No. 9\".<br />\nFor an English group, the Clash<br />\ndeals with surprisingly American subject<br />\nmatter. The best example of this is \"The<br />\nCall-Up,\" a pointed anti-draft statement.<br />\n(\"It's up to you not to heed the call-up/<br />\nYou must not ask the way you were<br />\nbrought up... All the young people from<br />\ndown the ages/ Gladly marched off to<br />\ndie.\") Although this isn't quite Hemingway or Heller commenting on the terrible<br />\nnature of war, \"The Call-Up\" stands far<br />\nabove the rest of \"mainstream\" New<br />\nWave in both maturity and strength. The<br />\nsame can be said of \"The Magnificent<br />\nSeven,\" a collage of images portraying a<br />\nmad post-industrial Western world over<br />\nwhich we have no control. \"The Leader\"<br /><br />\nThe Clash: New Wave artists who refuse to be bullied into commercialism<br />\nAlthough<br />\nis a short vignette about the dangers of touch of self-indulgence.<br />\nideological repression when there is no avant-garde attempts like\"Mensforth Hill\"<br />\nseparation of Church and State, with such are slightly interesting the first time<br />\nimagery as \"The Leader rides in a gov- through, after repeated listenings they<br />\nernment car/ In the dark is a minister/ sound like so much noise; unfortunately,<br />\nThe Leader never leaves his door ajar/ He the enjoyment of playing with electronic<br />\nswings a whip from the Bolo War,\" synthesizers and mixing machines doesn't<br />\npunctuated by the cynical chorus, \"The transfer to the listener.<br />\npeople must have something good to read<br />\nRegardless of this small defect<br />\n(limited to only two songs on the album),<br />\non a Sunday!\"<br />\nThe Clash does not make only Sandinista! is an excellent album, unsweeping statements about society. doubtedly one of the best of the past<br />\n\"Junkie Slip\" points the barrel back at year.

Some of the hardest<br />\nlie ahead. Like the one you're<br />\nfacing right now - how to<br />\nlaunch your career so that every<br />\nyear counts as a big one in<br />\npersonal and professional<br />\nachieyement. You want to look<br />\nback and say \"Now that was a<br />\ngood move.'<br />\nIt's your life and your future.<br />\nWhat does all this have to do<br />\nwith The BDM Corporation? A<br />\nlot. Because we have at least<br />\nsome of the answers you will<br />\nwant to consider ... answers to<br />\nquestions like these:<br />\n1.\"Where should I look for<br />\na career?\"<br />\nLook for a company that is corn<br />\nmitted to growth and has compiled an outstanding growth record to confirm that commitment.<br />\n(BDM has grown at a rate of 30% per<br />\nyear throughout the 1970s.)<br />\n2. \"Why is corporate growth so<br />\nimportant?\"<br />\nStrong corporate growth means that<br />\nthe opportunity for personal career<br />\ngrowth is much greater than in a more<br />\nstatic organization. (Graduates who<br />\njoined BDM two years ago have moved<br />\nfar ahead of their counterparts in most<br />\nother organizations.)<br />\n3. \"Why should I join a professional services company?\"<br />\nFor one reason, because ours has<br />\nbecome a sevice economy. A modem professional services company<br />\noffers greater opportunity, greater<br />\ndiversity, greater potential. (BDM<br />\ngives you the best of two worlds professional services growth plus a<br />\ncorporate focus on tomorrow's technology and systems.)<br />\n4.\"What are the most promising<br />\nfields in which to apply my technical skills?\"<br />\nNational defense, communications,<br /><br />\nThe Professionals We Seek<br />\nWe offer career opportunities to men<br />\nand women with degrees in:<br />\nENGINEERING<br />\n(especially EE, SE,and ChE)<br />\nAPPLIED PHYSICS<br />\nAPPLIED MATHEMATICS<br />\nCOMPUTER SCIENCE<br />\n(Scientific Applications)<br />\nOPERATIONS RESEARCH.<br />\nWe're looking for highly motivated<br />\npeople who want the challenge of<br />\nanalyzing and solving problems in<br />\ncommunications, software development,systems analysis,computer simu lation and modeling,laser physics and<br />\nengineering, electrb-optics, nuclear<br />\neffects, statistical test design, logistics,<br />\nelectronics, environmental sciences,<br />\neconomics and management sciences,<br />\nenergy production and distribution,and<br />\nrelated areas.<br /><br />\nThere will be a speaker from the<br />\nCHESAPEAKE ENERGY ALLIANCE, talking on nuclear power,<br />\nfollowing the regular business meeting of the YOUNG DEMOCRATS.<br />\nThe meeting will begin at 8:00 pm in<br />\nConference Room A on Tuesday,<br />\nMarch 5.<br />\nOn Tuesday, March 10, at 4:00<br />\npm in Remsen 221, Dr. Steve Harris<br />\nof General Motors Research Laboratories will give a seminar on Two<br />\nNew Laser Diagnostic Techniques for<br />\nCombustion Studies.<br />\nThe Core course in Sociophysiology<br />\nwill be showing Titticut Follies, a<br />\nfilm concerning life in a mental institution onMarch 6 at 1 p.m. in<br />\nShaffer 3.

A professional staff<br />\n(your future colleagues) with<br />\noutstanding credentials and<br />\ndemonstrated achievements. A<br />\nworking environment that is<br />\nboth thoughtful and dynamic. Nationwide locations. A planned advancement program offering multiple \"ladders\" of career growth within a flexible<br />\nmatrix management structure. A<br />\nchance to contribute directly to major<br />\nnational and international programs<br />\nand issues.
