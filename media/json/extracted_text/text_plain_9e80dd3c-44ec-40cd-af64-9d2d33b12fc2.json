Basically, Gryder explained,<br />\nthe number of committee members has<br />\nbeen reduced from about twenty to<br />\neleven. The rationale for the size<br />\nreduction was to increase each<br />\nrecommender's exposure to the<br />\ngraduating class, enabling the professor<br />\nnot only to evaluate the individual on<br />\npersonal merits, but to emphasize those<br />\naspects of the student's background<br />\nwhich would improve the applicant's<br />\nchances of admission. \"We want to be as<br />\npositive as possible, without lying,\" said<br />\nGryder.

We will use slide<br />\nshows, books, magazine<br />\narticles, films and life experiences to study what the<br />\nnuclear strategy is now<br />\nand how we have gotten there; to learn what this means<br />\nin our own lives, its<br />\nconnection with the structure of our society and<br />\nto question how we can<br />\nrespond. Materials will cost each student about five<br />\ndollars.<br />\nInstructor:<br />\nRosemary McGuire and other members of CCAPL<br />\nTime:<br />\nWednesday, 8:30<br />\n<br />\nTENNIS<br />\n:41.

They deserve a lot of credit for<br />\nundertaking the project. There's no doubt<br />\nabout the show's impact; I have a feeling<br />\nthat Roots might also permanently<br />\nchange television in its approach to<br />\nvarious issues.<br />\nI don't believe even ABC anticipated<br />\nthe kind of response they .got. Because of<br />\nthe huge audience, there should be some<br />\nrethinking of a lot of concepts at all three<br />\nnetworks. The impact was<br />\nunexpected\u2014spectacular in its way.<br />\nAs for the criticisms about historical<br />\ninaccuracies, we should recognize it as a<br />\ndramatic presentation. Even Haley<br />\nfictionalized certain elements in his book.<br />\nPhilip Curtin,History<br />\nWhite traders would not be on a<br />\nslavery expedition in Gambia because<br />\nthey were forbidden. Also, two-thirds of<br />\nthe Gambian population was enslaved at<br />\nthe time of Kunta's capture. The keeper<br />\nof the oral traditions probably told Haley<br />\nwhat he wanted to hear. The portrayal of<br />\nGambian life was idealized and<br />\nromanticized to' the point of being a<br />\nGarden of Eden.<br />\n<br />\nRic Pfeffer,Political Science<br />\nIn a recent editorial, the Sun stated<br />\nthat the television dramatization of Alex<br />\nHaley's novel \"Roots\" was \"political.\"<br />\nIndeed, it called the showing \"a<br />\nprofoundly political event.\" That is quite<br />\ntrue. But the clear implication of so<br />\ncharacterizing \"Roofs\" seems to be that<br />\nwhat we normally experience in the mass<br />\nmedia and in our educational system is<br />\nsomehow not, or less, \"political.\"<br />\nIf. however, \"Roots\" has \"taught or<br />\nreminded\" us of \"the heart of the<br />\nAmerican experience\" and if \"the<br />\ndeficiencies of our educational system<br />\nand the mind-debilitating lure of the junk<br />\nthat TV offers\" has meant, as you<br />\ncorrectly claim, that \"millions of<br />\nAmericans...do not adequately know and<br />\ntherefore do not adequately feel the<br />\nforces that shaped (and continue to<br />\nshape) our society,\" then must it not<br />\nfollow our daily run-of-the-mill culture is<br />\nalso profoundly, if normally less<br />\nobviously, \"political?\"<br />\nWhatever may be intended, our culture<br />\nin so many ways tends to rniseducate,<br />\ndistract and pacify -us about ourselves and<br />\nthe forces that shape our lives.<br />\nIs it not, for example, extremely<br />\npolitical to portray working class people<br />\nas quaintly mindless boobs, as so much of<br />\nTV does? Was it apolitical for the<br />\nimmortal \"I Love Lucy\" to show women<br />\nprimarily as purposeless digbats? Is<br />\n\"Gone with the Wind,\" the media event\u2022<br />\nwith which \"Roots\" most frequently is<br />\nbeing compared, really less political?<br />\nMy understanding is that all of these<br />\nare political, although the content and<br />\nvisibility of the politics may differ from<br />\ncase to case.<br />\nIt is not only the handful of TV shows,<br />\nmovies and books that move people to a<br />\nnew consciousness of the forces that<br />\nshape our lives that are<br />\npolitical. The much more numerous and<br />\npervasive cultural phenomena that<br />\ndiscreetly immobilize us and impede such<br />\nan understanding are equally political.<br />\n<br />\nWillie Lee Rose,History<br />\nIt's not really history and should not<br />\nbe judged as such. It's a television show.<br />\nWilliam Freehling, History<br />\nThere are some major factual<br />\ninaccuracies, and the last episode really<br />\nbothered me. But I agree with Benjamin<br />\nQuarles, that Roots contains the \"essence<br />\nof truth.\"<br />\nRon Walters, History<br />\nI didn't see. many episodes. The first<br />\npart I saw had a mother explaining<br />\nAfrican culture to her child. It sounded<br />\nlike a drama written by an<br />\nan throopologist...Another episode<br />\nconcerned Nat Turner's rebellion, and<br />\nthey were off by ten years...(The series)<br />\nfalsified relations between blacks and<br />\nwhites.<br />\nGarry Wills, Humanities Center<br />\n<br />\nFranklin W. Knight, History<br />\nRoots tries to be drama, not history.<br />\nThe factual inaccuracies, therefore, don't<br />\nbother me as much as my colleagues. But<br />\nthe production also fails as drama. The<br />\ncharacters are stereotyped; the conflict<br />\nbetween good slaves and evil masters is<br />\ntoo obvious. The last episode was<br />\nespecially equivocal...the photography<br />\nwas inferior.<br />\n<br />\nWe have traded stereotypes. All the<br />\nblacks in \"Roots\" were loving and proud,<br />\nandm ost whites lustful and lying. If the<br />\nTV show ran in a theater, a white person<br />\nmight well hear blacks behind him say<br />\nthat the \"massa\" on the screen reminded<br />\nthem of the boss at their place of work...<br />\n\"Roots\" is a moving story, dealing<br />\nwith the perennial objects of human<br />\nemotion: marriage, children, death,<br />\n<br />\npoverty, achievement, loss, pride, solace.<br />\nThe important thing is not that these'are<br />\nseen almost as a black monopoly in the<br />\nstory but that blacks are finally allowed<br />\nthe dignity of a vulnerability faced day<br />\nby day,lived with and outlived.<br />\nFor most of our history, blacks were<br />\ndenied the sensitivity and depth to<br />\nexperience these things in any important<br />\nway. They were laughing and carefree<br />\nchildren.<br />\nThe Most balanced jugement of<br />\n\"Roots\" came, as I thought it would,<br />\nfrom Dr. Benjamin Quarles, the foremost<br />\nliving scholar of black American history.<br />\nHe admits the many inaccuracies and<br />\npointed out some I had not noticed or<br />\nread about. But he expected<br />\npopularization, and the question is<br />\nwhether basic truths were conveyed: He<br />\n<br />\nthinks so.<br />\n\"The show does indicate the abiding<br />\nstrength of the black family\u2014that it is not<br />\nthe 'tangle of pathologies' Daniel Patrick<br />\nMoynihan called it,\" Dr. Quarles said..<br />\n\"The approach was fictional\u2014even Haley<br />\nadmits he transposed events for effect.<br />\n\"The method- of the TV series is not<br />\nmine. But the audience reached is not<br />\nmine either. I suppose Trollope purists<br />\ncan object to certain effects in the Palliser series, but it will reach many people who<br />\ndo not read Trollope.\"<br />\nThere were plenty of errors in the<br />\nAdams Chronicles on TV. But the basic<br />\nsense of pride in one American family<br />\nwas conveyed, and worth conveying. The<br />\nsame is true of \"Roots\", a story of pride<br />\nabout which all Americans, black and<br />\nwhite, can and should be proud.<br />\n<br />\nt .inummidaussung aularump.<br />\nNOR F uhrl (004R)<br />\n<br />\n\fAt the National Security Agency we think about<br />\nyour future. . because our own future and even<br />\nthe future of this country's security depend on<br />\nhawing a team of intelligent and imaginative<br />\npeople.

Gryder<br />\nsaid that most of the present changes had<br />\nbeen implemented during 'the tenure of<br />\nhis predecessor, the late Dr. Matthew<br />\nDebuskey. Basically, Gryder explained,<br />\nthe number of committee members has<br />\nbeen reduced from about twenty to<br />\neleven. The rationale for the size<br />\nreduction was to increase each<br />\nrecommender's exposure to the<br />\ngraduating class, enabling the professor<br />\nnot only to evaluate the individual on<br />\npersonal merits, but to emphasize those<br />\naspects of the student's background<br />\nwhich would improve the applicant's<br />\nchances of admission. \"We want to be as<br />\npositive as possible, without lying,\" said<br />\nGryder. With a working knowledge of the<br />\nlevel of competetition a candidate is<br />\nlikely to encounter, the recommending<br />\nprofessor can find \"some reason why the<br />\ngraduate school might want to accept the<br />\nstudent,\" Gryder pointed out.<br />\nDean of Undergraduate and Graduate<br />\nStudents Sigmund R. Suskind, who was<br />\nactive in the planning and<br />\nimplementation of the changes, remarked<br />\nthat previously, \"the large diffuse<br />\nCommittee was difficult for the chairman<br />\nto control, and could not function in a<br /><br />\ntight fashion.\" According to Suskind, the<br />\ncommittee is now composed of faculty<br />\nmembers with previous experience in this<br />\narea. \"By being chosen for the<br />\ncommittee, it suggests that they've done a<br />\ngood job in the past.\"<br />\nGryder explained that ill addition to<br />\nthe changes in the recommendations<br />\ncommittee itself, a number of related \\<br />\nprojects were being planned cr developed. \\<br />\n\"We're developing some resource<br />\npeople at the Med School; for answering<br />\nany questions students may have about<br />\nthe difference's between specific schools,<br />\nand so on,\" Gryder asserted.

They deserve a lot of credit for<br />\nundertaking the project. There's no doubt<br />\nabout the show's impact; I have a feeling<br />\nthat Roots might also permanently<br />\nchange television in its approach to<br />\nvarious issues.<br />\nI don't believe even ABC anticipated<br />\nthe kind of response they .got. Because of<br />\nthe huge audience, there should be some<br />\nrethinking of a lot of concepts at all three<br />\nnetworks. The impact was<br />\nunexpected\u2014spectacular in its way.<br />\nAs for the criticisms about historical<br />\ninaccuracies, we should recognize it as a<br />\ndramatic presentation. Even Haley<br />\nfictionalized certain elements in his book.<br />\nPhilip Curtin,History<br />\nWhite traders would not be on a<br />\nslavery expedition in Gambia because<br />\nthey were forbidden. Also, two-thirds of<br />\nthe Gambian population was enslaved at<br />\nthe time of Kunta's capture. The keeper<br />\nof the oral traditions probably told Haley<br />\nwhat he wanted to hear. The portrayal of<br />\nGambian life was idealized and<br />\nromanticized to' the point of being a<br />\nGarden of Eden.<br /><br />\nRic Pfeffer,Political Science<br />\nIn a recent editorial, the Sun stated<br />\nthat the television dramatization of Alex<br />\nHaley's novel \"Roots\" was \"political.\"<br />\nIndeed, it called the showing \"a<br />\nprofoundly political event.\" That is quite<br />\ntrue. But the clear implication of so<br />\ncharacterizing \"Roofs\" seems to be that<br />\nwhat we normally experience in the mass<br />\nmedia and in our educational system is<br />\nsomehow not, or less, \"political.\"<br />\nIf. however, \"Roots\" has \"taught or<br />\nreminded\" us of \"the heart of the<br />\nAmerican experience\" and if \"the<br />\ndeficiencies of our educational system<br />\nand the mind-debilitating lure of the junk<br />\nthat TV offers\" has meant, as you<br />\ncorrectly claim, that \"millions of<br />\nAmericans...do not adequately know and<br />\ntherefore do not adequately feel the<br />\nforces that shaped (and continue to<br />\nshape) our society,\" then must it not<br />\nfollow our daily run-of-the-mill culture is<br />\nalso profoundly, if normally less<br />\nobviously, \"political?\"<br />\nWhatever may be intended, our culture<br />\nin so many ways tends to rniseducate,<br />\ndistract and pacify -us about ourselves and<br />\nthe forces that shape our lives.<br />\nIs it not, for example, extremely<br />\npolitical to portray working class people<br />\nas quaintly mindless boobs, as so much of<br />\nTV does? Was it apolitical for the<br />\nimmortal \"I Love Lucy\" to show women<br />\nprimarily as purposeless digbats? Is<br />\n\"Gone with the Wind,\" the media event\u2022<br />\nwith which \"Roots\" most frequently is<br />\nbeing compared, really less political?<br />\nMy understanding is that all of these<br />\nare political, although the content and<br />\nvisibility of the politics may differ from<br />\ncase to case.<br />\nIt is not only the handful of TV shows,<br />\nmovies and books that move people to a<br />\nnew consciousness of the forces that<br />\nshape our lives that are<br />\npolitical. The much more numerous and<br />\npervasive cultural phenomena that<br />\ndiscreetly immobilize us and impede such<br />\nan understanding are equally political.<br /><br />\nWillie Lee Rose,History<br />\nIt's not really history and should not<br />\nbe judged as such. It's a television show.<br />\nWilliam Freehling, History<br />\nThere are some major factual<br />\ninaccuracies, and the last episode really<br />\nbothered me. But I agree with Benjamin<br />\nQuarles, that Roots contains the \"essence<br />\nof truth.\"<br />\nRon Walters, History<br />\nI didn't see. many episodes. The first<br />\npart I saw had a mother explaining<br />\nAfrican culture to her child. It sounded<br />\nlike a drama written by an<br />\nan throopologist...Another episode<br />\nconcerned Nat Turner's rebellion, and<br />\nthey were off by ten years...(The series)<br />\nfalsified relations between blacks and<br />\nwhites.<br />\nGarry Wills, Humanities Center<br /><br />\nFranklin W. Knight, History<br />\nRoots tries to be drama, not history.<br />\nThe factual inaccuracies, therefore, don't<br />\nbother me as much as my colleagues. But<br />\nthe production also fails as drama. The<br />\ncharacters are stereotyped; the conflict<br />\nbetween good slaves and evil masters is<br />\ntoo obvious. The last episode was<br />\nespecially equivocal...the photography<br />\nwas inferior.<br /><br />\nWe have traded stereotypes. All the<br />\nblacks in \"Roots\" were loving and proud,<br />\nandm ost whites lustful and lying. If the<br />\nTV show ran in a theater, a white person<br />\nmight well hear blacks behind him say<br />\nthat the \"massa\" on the screen reminded<br />\nthem of the boss at their place of work...<br />\n\"Roots\" is a moving story, dealing<br />\nwith the perennial objects of human<br />\nemotion: marriage, children, death,<br /><br />\npoverty, achievement, loss, pride, solace.<br />\nThe important thing is not that these'are<br />\nseen almost as a black monopoly in the<br />\nstory but that blacks are finally allowed<br />\nthe dignity of a vulnerability faced day<br />\nby day,lived with and outlived.<br />\nFor most of our history, blacks were<br />\ndenied the sensitivity and depth to<br />\nexperience these things in any important<br />\nway. They were laughing and carefree<br />\nchildren.<br />\nThe Most balanced jugement of<br />\n\"Roots\" came, as I thought it would,<br />\nfrom Dr. Benjamin Quarles, the foremost<br />\nliving scholar of black American history.<br />\nHe admits the many inaccuracies and<br />\npointed out some I had not noticed or<br />\nread about. But he expected<br />\npopularization, and the question is<br />\nwhether basic truths were conveyed: He<br /><br />\nthinks so.<br />\n\"The show does indicate the abiding<br />\nstrength of the black family\u2014that it is not<br />\nthe 'tangle of pathologies' Daniel Patrick<br />\nMoynihan called it,\" Dr. Quarles said..<br />\n\"The approach was fictional\u2014even Haley<br />\nadmits he transposed events for effect.<br />\n\"The method- of the TV series is not<br />\nmine. But the audience reached is not<br />\nmine either. I suppose Trollope purists<br />\ncan object to certain effects in the Palliser series, but it will reach many people who<br />\ndo not read Trollope.\"<br />\nThere were plenty of errors in the<br />\nAdams Chronicles on TV. But the basic<br />\nsense of pride in one American family<br />\nwas conveyed, and worth conveying. The<br />\nsame is true of \"Roots\", a story of pride<br />\nabout which all Americans, black and<br />\nwhite, can and should be proud.<br /><br />\nt .inummidaussung aularump.<br />\nNOR F uhrl (004R)<br /><br />\nAt the National Security Agency we think about<br />\nyour future. . because our own future and even<br />\nthe future of this country's security depend on<br />\nhawing a team of intelligent and imaginative<br />\npeople.
