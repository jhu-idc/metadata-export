Verhaalen, asserted<br />\nthat , \"Last year, out of<br />\napproximately 5,000 students,<br />\nwe had 2800 undergraduate<br />\nstudents and 2300 graduate<br />\nstudents. This year out of 5200<br />\nstudents registered in the Evening<br />\nCollege we have 2300<br />\nundergraduates and 2900<br />\ngraduate students. The coin has<br />\nflipped.\"<br />\nThese figures reflect a trend<br />\ntowards a larger graduate student<br />\nenrollment in the Evening<br />\nCollege, first discernible in the<br />\nearly 1970's.<br />\nVerhaalen commented, \"By<br />\nthe early 1970's we had almost as<br />\nmany graduate degrees awarded<br />\nas bachelor degrees. Now we're<br />\n<br />\nto the point where more<br />\n[students] graduate with<br />\ngraduate degrees than<br />\nundergraduate degrees.\"<br />\nThis propensity has increased.<br />\nIn 1974, out of the 774 diplomas<br />\ngranted by the Evening College.<br />\n550 were to persons who had<br />\ncompleted graduate studies.<br />\nThe high cost of tuition at the<br />\nEvening College was cited as one<br />\npossible reason by Verhaalen for<br />\nthe decline in figures in<br />\nundergraduate enrollment.<br />\n\"It costs more at Hopkins to<br />\nmeet the necessary requirements<br />\nfor the BA degree than from one<br />\nof the local state community<br />\ncolleges,\" said Verhaalen.<br />\nAt present, tuition at the<br />\nEvening College is $45 per credit<br />\nhour with a $20 application fee.<br />\nAt nearby Anne Arundel<br />\nCommunity College, one of the<br />\nstate community colleges to<br />\nwhich Verhaalen referred, tuition<br />\ncharges were $12 per credit hour<br />\nfor the 1973-74 academic year<br />\nwith a $10 application fee.<br />\n<br />\nVerhaalen cited another<br />\npossible reason for the trend.<br />\n\"The Hopkins' name is more<br />\nimportant on the graduate level<br />\nthan the undergraduate level.\"<br />\nVerhaalen maintained that<br />\nthese relatively high charges for<br />\nstudents were necessary to meet<br />\nthe costs incurred by the<br />\noperation of the Evening College.<br />\nCommenting on the budget of<br />\nthe Evening College, he asserted,<br />\n\"If you take all the direct and<br />\nindirect costs involved, we<br />\noperate on a balanced budget<br />\nbasis.\" Verhaalen pointed to the<br />\nUse by Evening College students<br />\nof the Rathskellar and unlimited<br />\nprivileges at the Eisenhower<br />\nLibrary as two examples of these<br />\n\"indirect costs.\"<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nis an innovator in adult<br />\neducation, according to<br />\nVerhaalen. \"It was tho first<br />\ninstitution of higher learning<br />\nwhich allowed students to<br />\nmatriculate for full degree<br />\nprograms.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fThE<br />\n<br />\nhopkiNs<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\n1xxix no. 12/tuesday, october 1.j, iy;.#/paltimore, mory1and179th. year<br />\n<br />\npenury<br />\nThough most knew that the $.300 tuition hike was a<br />\nforegone conclusion, news of the near-unanimous approval of<br />\nthe raise at yesterday's Board of Trustees meeting hit home<br />\nwith painful immediacy. While the Board members were<br />\napparently caught up in the sweeping certitude that the<br />\ntuition hike was unavoidable, there were still the noticeable<br />\nadherents to principle like Young Trustee Shep Hoffman,<br />\nwho cast a rare no vote, and the protesting student who kept<br />\na long vigil outside the Board luncheon with a hand-fashioned<br />\nplacard decrying the action.<br />\nWe agree with Hoffman's point\u2014that the University<br />\ncannot, in good conscience, raise tuition without<br />\nguaranteeing a commensurate raise in financial assistance.<br />\nYet, President Muller is tellingly hesitant on this issue, noting<br />\nonly that he \"would like to offer a proportionate increase in<br />\nfinancial aid,\" but cannot \"commit\" himself or \"offer<br />\nprospective figures.\"<br />\n, The tuition increase will, even if all undergraduates are<br />\nable to meet it, yield an extra $600,000 in tuition fees, not so<br />\nsubstantial an increment when compared to the Homewood<br />\nbudget of close to $10 million, and the $100 million<br />\nUniversity-wide budget.<br />\nStrange that the University was able to raise the extra<br />\nhundreds of thousands of dollars needed to supplement the<br />\nescalating costs of the Hopkins Union.

If Hearst was \"the procreator<br />\nof that vaguely elucidating slime<br />\nknown as yellow journalism,\" then<br />\nthe News-Letter must certainly be<br />\nthe perpetuator of that same<br />\nsensationalism.<br />\nThe case in point is the coverage<br />\nof the Student Activities<br />\nCommission's first meeting of the<br />\nyear. It is true that the SAC<br />\napproved the proposal making the<br />\nStudent Council President's<br />\nposition on the Executive<br />\nCommittee dependent on his being<br />\nelected as one of the at-large<br />\nmembers.

It is very necessary<br />\nto have the kind of leverage<br />\nintrinsic to the office of SC<br />\nPresident as an integral part of the<br />\nExecutive Committee. Besides, any<br />\nmember of the SAC on the Exec.<br />\nComm. is likely to have some<br />\nconflicts of interest due to his<br />\nrepresentation of an organization<br />\nin the SAC as a whole.

FEIGIN<br />\nIn the name of progress, the<br />\nhand-masoned cement benches in<br />\nfront of Levering Hall donated<br />\nby the class of 1941 have been<br />\nreplaced by new aluminumframed benches.<br />\nAccording to Bill Campbell,<br />\nDirector of Plant Operations, the<br />\nseven new benches were put in<br />\nthe place of the four old ones to<br />\nprovide extra seating, \"because<br />\nthat is such a popular place.\"<br />\nHis other consideration was to<br />\nuse three of the benches to block<br />\noff the flagstone from vehicular<br />\ntraffic that was damaging to it.<br />\nHe deemed this \"more.desirable\"<br />\nthan blocking the area off with<br />\nsteel or concrete columns<br />\nStudent reaction to the new<br />\nbenches has been varied. John<br />\nColmers, Student Assistant to the<br />\nDean, was dismayed that the<br />\nClass of 1941 was not notified<br />\nabout the removal of their<br />\ndonation. \"At least the class<br />\npresident should have been<br />\nnotified. I am considering writing<br />\na letter to the entire class,<br />\nincluding those who were killed<br />\nin World War II about the<br />\nmatter,\" he said.<br />\nCampbell did not feel this was<br />\nnecessary. \"We did not remove<br />\n<br />\nthe plaque. The benches are still<br />\na gift of the Class of '41.\"<br />\nHe compared this to a class<br />\ngift of a television. \"When the<br />\nappliance wears out and has to be<br />\nreplaced, no one notifies the class<br />\nthat made the gift,\" Campbell<br />\nexplained.<br />\nOne anonymous frequenter of<br />\nthe flagstone area expressed<br />\n<br />\nwould have replaced more of the<br />\nflagstone.\"<br />\n\"Unfortunately the material<br />\nthat was used there has<br />\npenetrated the stone,\" he added.<br />\n\"It would be nice if they could<br />\nbe removed so that other<br />\ndecorations would be possible.\"<br />\nAnother frequent user of the<br />\narea declared, \"They took away<br />\n<br />\nanxiety over the removal of some<br />\npieces of the \"pretty yellow<br />\nflowers\" left over from last year's<br />\nfair production of \"The Wizard<br />\nof Oz\".<br />\nCampbell responded that the<br />\nflagstones that were replaced had<br />\nbeen damaged by the traffic in<br />\nthe area. \"If the purpose had<br />\nbeen to remove the flowers we<br />\n<br />\nthe old, comfortable benches<br />\nbecause everyone used to sit<br />\nthere and smoke dope.

Eisenhower, who noted<br />\nthat one of his two major<br />\ndisappointments at the end of his<br />\nfirst presidency was that he had<br />\nnot obtained a Student Union for<br />\nHopkins, was responsible for the<br />\nraising of the money for the<br />\nUnion's construction when he<br />\nreturned in 1971 as President for<br />\nthe second time.<br />\nThanks'<br />\nHarvey cited the donors who<br />\nhad helped make the Union<br />\npossible, and the rooms<br />\ndedicated in their honor: The<br />\nCommercial Credit Company, the<br />\ndining terrace, as a tribute to<br />\nEisenhower; H.A.B.

In<br />\nJanuary, we will send them<br />\nreminders that they must find<br />\nother arrangements for next<br />\nyear,\" Heist explained.<br />\nHe revealed that the<br />\nUniversity, which can house<br />\n1250 students, now rents to 395<br />\ngrad students, some with<br />\nfamilies, and 841 undergrads, the<br />\nmajority of which are freshmen.<br /><br />\nfor all members of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, Oldfield said.<br />\nProgramming<br />\nSavitz's brief address consisted<br />\nof thanks to those responsible for<br />\nthe Union on behalf of the many<br />\nundergraduates who use the<br />\nfacility.<br />\nTrustees at the ceremony<br />\nexpressed their pleasure with the<br />\nUnion facility. One trustee<br />\nremarked \"It makes you glad to<br />\nbe associated with the<br />\nUniversity.\" Another<br />\ncommented, \"I think it's needed,<br />\nso that people will have a chance<br />\nto meet and socialize with. one<br />\nanother.\"<br />\nTrustees were given tours of<br />\nHopkins' newest building.<br /><br />\nBlum would like to see a new<br />\nsystem put into effect for<br />\nassigning upperclass<br />\nundergraduate housing.<br />\n\"In the past, priority was given<br />\nto women, blacks, minorities and<br />\nhandicapped students who<br />\notherwise might have trouble<br />\nfinding housing,\" Blum stated.<br />\n\"Mr. Hiest told us that last year<br />\nno priority system was used but<br />\nit worked as if there was. All the<br />\nwomen who wanted housing got<br />\nit.''<br />\nHeist explained that last year's<br />\npolicy \"was generally first come,<br />\nfirst serve, with exceptions for<br />\nthose with unusual problems.\"<br />\nThis system resulted in an<br />\nall-night sit-in in the lobby of<br />\nWolman Hall by students trying<br />\nto be first in line in the morning.<br />\n\"In response to this, a<br />\ncommittee was formed of<br />\nstudents to decide what is the<br />\nfairest way to make housing<br />\nspace available,\" Heistisaid.<br />\nBoth Blum and Heist see a<br />\nlottery system as a possible<br />\nsolution in assigning housing for<br />\nWolman Hall, Rogers House and<br />\nthe Wyman Park row house.<br />\n\"We haven't decided the<br />\ndetails of the lottery yet. There<br />\nare five 'or six way to run this<br />\nsort of lottery\u2014with peqple<br />\napplying in groups, as singles,<br />\netc.,\" explained Heist.<br />\nBlum saw the lottery system as<br />\naffecting only vacancies. \"It<br />\nwould be unfair to ask students<br />\nalready in University housing to<br />\nmove out.\"<br />\nThe SC committee also hopes<br />\nto insure that all freshmen will<br />\nhave accommodations in the<br />\ndorms.<br />\n\"This year housing<br />\nassignments for freshmen will be<br />\ndone in conjunction with the<br />\nAdmission's Office,\" Blum<br />\ncommented. \"We want to see a<br />\nflexible policy where freshmen<br />\nare accommodated first. Bul<br />\nthere should be some extra space,<br />\nso that upperclassmen already.<br />\nliving there need not be kicked<br />\nout.\"<br /><br />\nHeist suggested that a lottery<br />\nsystem could also be used in the<br />\ndorms to assign the spare rooms<br />\nto upperclassmen.<br />\nTo aid upperclass students<br />\nwho cannot get University space,<br />\nthe Off-Campus Housing Office<br />\nwill be enlarged, revealed Heist.<br />\n\"This will be a rec.ourse for<br />\nupperclassmen, to direct them to<br />\nthe right channels in finding<br />\nhousing,\" Blum stated.<br />\n\"I'd like to work together with<br />\nthe SC on this,\" Heist said. \"I'd<br />\nlike to see the office open by<br />\nJanuary to alert students of<br />\navailable housing and advise them<br />\non tenant and landlord rights.\"<br />\nThe Office will also provide<br />\nstudents with access to the<br />\nUniversity's lawyers for legal<br />\nguidance on housing-related<br />\nproblems.<br /><br />\nfreshman class, Karen Feinstein<br />\nand Judith Hazelcom will face<br />\neachother in run-offs.<br />\nLori Marcus ran uncontested<br />\nfor the office of secretary of the<br />\nclass of '78 and was declared the<br />\nwinner.<br />\nOf the six candidates running<br />\nfor the Honor Commission,<br />\nWarren Fink, Randy Randozzo,<br />\nNorman Schlossberger and Hal S.<br />\nWasserman were declared<br />\nwinners.<br />\nRun-offs will also be held<br />\nbetween Suzanne Bachur and<br />\nMario Echemendia for the office<br />\nof treasurer and between<br />\nKenneth Blake, Cosme<br />\nGomez-Oatino, Scotti Kaminer,<br />\nDidi Krausz and Samuel P.

Apparently there is a<br />\nreal ignorance on the part of the<br />\nfreshmen concerning this issue,\"<br />\nhe added.<br />\nBialeck said he considers one<br /><br />\nof his primary goals to be a<br />\n\"freshman voice in the entire<br />\nschool policy.\"<br />\nElson, his opponent, saw<br />\nhimself as \"less idealistic than<br />\nBialeck.\" He commented that he<br />\nwas \"mainly interested in having<br />\nas good a time as possible for the<br />\nfreshmen.\"<br />\nHe could not see \"any<br />\noverwhelming political issues that<br />\ncan be changed within the<br />\nframework of the freshman class<br />\npresidency.\"<br />\nHazelcom, a vice presidential_<br />\ncandidate, said there was \" a<br />\ngeneral lack of unity among<br />\nfreshmen, noting that\"it seemed<br />\nto be a lonely time for a lot of<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nShe mentioned the plight of<br />\nthe transfer student at Hopkins<br />\nand the need for intra-dorm<br />\ncommunications as two of her<br />\nprimary concerns.<br />\nFeinstein, her opponent,<br />\ncampaigned jointly with Elson,<br />\nbut based her success not on the<br />\n\"seeming coalition\" with the<br />\npresidential candidate, but rather<br />\non the fact that she \"tried to<br />\nmeet as many people as<br />\npossible:\"<br /><br />\nGraduate enrollment increasing<br />\nBy BOB BUCHANAN<br />\nWith total enrollment up<br />\nroughly 200, registration figures<br />\nfor the 1974-75 academic year at<br />\nthe Hopkins Evening College<br />\nreflect a trend towards increased<br />\nenrollment in the College's<br />\ngraduate program.<br />\nDean of the Evening College,<br />\nRoman J. Verhaalen, asserted<br />\nthat , \"Last year, out of<br />\napproximately 5,000 students,<br />\nwe had 2800 undergraduate<br />\nstudents and 2300 graduate<br />\nstudents. This year out of 5200<br />\nstudents registered in the Evening<br />\nCollege we have 2300<br />\nundergraduates and 2900<br />\ngraduate students. The coin has<br />\nflipped.\"<br />\nThese figures reflect a trend<br />\ntowards a larger graduate student<br />\nenrollment in the Evening<br />\nCollege, first discernible in the<br />\nearly 1970's.<br />\nVerhaalen commented, \"By<br />\nthe early 1970's we had almost as<br />\nmany graduate degrees awarded<br />\nas bachelor degrees. Now we're<br /><br />\nto the point where more<br />\n[students] graduate with<br />\ngraduate degrees than<br />\nundergraduate degrees.\"<br />\nThis propensity has increased.<br />\nIn 1974, out of the 774 diplomas<br />\ngranted by the Evening College.<br />\n550 were to persons who had<br />\ncompleted graduate studies.<br />\nThe high cost of tuition at the<br />\nEvening College was cited as one<br />\npossible reason by Verhaalen for<br />\nthe decline in figures in<br />\nundergraduate enrollment.<br />\n\"It costs more at Hopkins to<br />\nmeet the necessary requirements<br />\nfor the BA degree than from one<br />\nof the local state community<br />\ncolleges,\" said Verhaalen.<br />\nAt present, tuition at the<br />\nEvening College is $45 per credit<br />\nhour with a $20 application fee.<br />\nAt nearby Anne Arundel<br />\nCommunity College, one of the<br />\nstate community colleges to<br />\nwhich Verhaalen referred, tuition<br />\ncharges were $12 per credit hour<br />\nfor the 1973-74 academic year<br />\nwith a $10 application fee.<br /><br />\nVerhaalen cited another<br />\npossible reason for the trend.<br />\n\"The Hopkins' name is more<br />\nimportant on the graduate level<br />\nthan the undergraduate level.\"<br />\nVerhaalen maintained that<br />\nthese relatively high charges for<br />\nstudents were necessary to meet<br />\nthe costs incurred by the<br />\noperation of the Evening College.<br />\nCommenting on the budget of<br />\nthe Evening College, he asserted,<br />\n\"If you take all the direct and<br />\nindirect costs involved, we<br />\noperate on a balanced budget<br />\nbasis.\" Verhaalen pointed to the<br />\nUse by Evening College students<br />\nof the Rathskellar and unlimited<br />\nprivileges at the Eisenhower<br />\nLibrary as two examples of these<br />\n\"indirect costs.\"<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nis an innovator in adult<br />\neducation, according to<br />\nVerhaalen. \"It was tho first<br />\ninstitution of higher learning<br />\nwhich allowed students to<br />\nmatriculate for full degree<br />\nprograms.\"<br /><br />\nThE<br /><br />\nhopkiNs<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\n1xxix no. 12/tuesday, october 1.j, iy;.#/paltimore, mory1and179th. year<br /><br />\npenury<br />\nThough most knew that the $.300 tuition hike was a<br />\nforegone conclusion, news of the near-unanimous approval of<br />\nthe raise at yesterday's Board of Trustees meeting hit home<br />\nwith painful immediacy. While the Board members were<br />\napparently caught up in the sweeping certitude that the<br />\ntuition hike was unavoidable, there were still the noticeable<br />\nadherents to principle like Young Trustee Shep Hoffman,<br />\nwho cast a rare no vote, and the protesting student who kept<br />\na long vigil outside the Board luncheon with a hand-fashioned<br />\nplacard decrying the action.<br />\nWe agree with Hoffman's point\u2014that the University<br />\ncannot, in good conscience, raise tuition without<br />\nguaranteeing a commensurate raise in financial assistance.<br />\nYet, President Muller is tellingly hesitant on this issue, noting<br />\nonly that he \"would like to offer a proportionate increase in<br />\nfinancial aid,\" but cannot \"commit\" himself or \"offer<br />\nprospective figures.\"<br />\n, The tuition increase will, even if all undergraduates are<br />\nable to meet it, yield an extra $600,000 in tuition fees, not so<br />\nsubstantial an increment when compared to the Homewood<br />\nbudget of close to $10 million, and the $100 million<br />\nUniversity-wide budget.<br />\nStrange that the University was able to raise the extra<br />\nhundreds of thousands of dollars needed to supplement the<br />\nescalating costs of the Hopkins Union. Strange that funds<br />\nwere found to increase from 7 to 13 the number of workers<br />\nin the Dean of Students Office in the past two years. Strange<br />\nthat Academic Services could be reorganized, if indeed the<br />\nbudget is so tight that students must get socked for a tuition<br />\nhike.<br />\nThe money which would<br />\nenable the University to<br />\nforego a tuition is hike is already here\u2014all that's needed is a<br />\nlittle frugality and perspicacity in the allocation and spending<br />\nof it.<br /><br />\nGonna wash this planet clean...<br /><br />\n'Let the buildings keep our children dry, before the deluge.'<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\n\"Most undergraduates move off<br />\ncampus after their freshman year.\"<br />\nPage 14 of The Johns flopkins<br />\nUniversity Circular.<br />\n5/15/74\u2014As we descended the<br />\nsteps into the basement flat at<br />\n2911 St. Paul Street, we saw Uncle<br />\nLenny waiting for us like Cato on<br />\nthe shores of Purgatory, lease in<br />\nhand, lips curled into an unctuous<br />\ngrin, his worn penny loafers and<br />\nmicroscopic tie bearing mute<br />\ntestimony to his drab existence.<br />\nClean-shaven youngsters (Benjie<br />\nshaves) have probably always been<br />\nputty in the hands of Uncle Lenny,<br />\na physicist, moral philosopher, and<br />\nveteran ghetto landlord who just<br />\nhappens to own the building we<br />\nchose to live in.

True, both<br />\ndoes<br />\nare seen in so<br />\nY spy movies.<br />\nsuffered from readership apathy,<br />\nStill, it was only Friday afternoon,<br /><br />\nand we enjoyed the cold beer and<br />\ncomfortable surroundings. We<br />\nmoved a table right to the center<br />\nand had the pleasure on a colder<br />\nday to drink plain air. It was the<br />\nbest afternoon so far, toasting<br />\nunder the sun in the Rathskellar.<br />\nBack home, the majority wanted<br />\nto watch some tube-the firebrands<br />\nhoped for \"Looney Tunes\" and<br />\nthey won. I didn't even think Bugs<br />\nBunny was on anymore. See what<br />\nbargains we have at Jerry's Ford.<br />\nWhat had happened to Bugs Bunny<br />\nand the rest of the jokers\u2014why did<br />\nI stop watching the cartoons? It<br />\nwas like playing straight joker for<br />\nso long and then someone had the<br />\nnerve to call some cards wild and<br />\nso doing undermine the entire<br />\ncourse of the game. We had been<br />\nplaying with the straight deck for<br />\ntoo long.<br />\nBugs Bunny was great and so<br />\nwas Foghorn Leghorn-city slicker<br />\nand country bumpkin-both were<br />\nhilarious. I haven't laughed so hard<br />\nsince I heard Jerry Ford say, \"I am<br />\nonly a Ford, not a Lincoln.\"<br />\nYou're telling me! Before, we<br />\nlaughed at Nixon in the White<br />\nHouse, now we laugh at Howard<br />\nCosell in the Broadcast booth as he<br />\ntalks to Teddy Kennedy during a<br />\nhalftime. So our tastes for comedy<br />\ndevelop.<br />\nBugs Bunny is one credible<br />\ncomic, and when the \"funnier\"<br />\nthings today are heard in Executive<br />\nTranscripts, Inauguration<br />\nSpeeches, and in stories about<br />\nstudents armed with crowbars and<br />\nHomer, something has gone wrong.<br />\nWe only laugh and think it is funny<br />\nbecause we have retained some<br />\ncynical vestiges in the general<br />\ncompulsion to keep our sanity at<br />\nJHU1974. So the story goes. Isn't<br />\nthat why we read story after story<br />\nabout aspiring writers getting<br />\ndrunk and \"fucked up\" in these<br />\npages, isn't that why we should<br />\nlaugh, but don't.<br />\nBack to the card game and the<br />\njokers: Bugs Bunny and Howard<br />\nCosell. The News-Letter now<br />\npresents a great opportunity for<br />\njokers and card players and serious<br />\npeople, too. Play cards if you will,<br />\nbut don't watch TV, (especially<br />\nchannel 3400). It's the same old<br />\nstory, week after week. Like the<br />\nRathskellar, the News-Letter has<br />\npotential, but it too is still being<br />\n\"visited occasionally.\" Maybe<br />\nothers will \"check it out\" more<br />\noften. It would be nice to see some<br /><br />\nbut both papers seem to have used<br />\nthe same tactic to combat it, as<br />\nwell. If Hearst was \"the procreator<br />\nof that vaguely elucidating slime<br />\nknown as yellow journalism,\" then<br />\nthe News-Letter must certainly be<br />\nthe perpetuator of that same<br />\nsensationalism.<br />\nThe case in point is the coverage<br />\nof the Student Activities<br />\nCommission's first meeting of the<br />\nyear. It is true that the SAC<br />\napproved the proposal making the<br />\nStudent Council President's<br />\nposition on the Executive<br />\nCommittee dependent on his being<br />\nelected as one of the at-large<br />\nmembers. I agree this is a rash<br />\nmove to make. It is very necessary<br />\nto have the kind of leverage<br />\nintrinsic to the office of SC<br />\nPresident as an integral part of the<br />\nExecutive Committee. Besides, any<br />\nmember of the SAC on the Exec.<br />\nComm. is likely to have some<br />\nconflicts of interest due to his<br />\nrepresentation of an organization<br />\nin the SAC as a whole. Mr. Savitz<br />\nat one point commented that most<br />\npeople have gotten as far as they<br />\nhave only by the ability to look at<br />\nquestions objectively, which<br />\nshould eliminate the possibilities of<br />\nfavoritism. Furthermore, by adding<br />\ntwo members to the Exec, Comm.,<br />\nit is most likely they will have the<br />\nneeded time to devote to their<br />\noffice and to the Committee, and<br />\nwill be able to bring new outlooks.<br />\nto one position because of<br /><br />\nBaltimore City Housing Department officials inspect Charles Village apartment prior to approval.<br />\nidea that I'm being...what's that<br />\n9/1 4/74\u2014A small lumberyard<br />\nbusy man.\"<br />\n\"You have a key as well,\" he<br />\nword my brother used to use...he<br />\narrives at our front door at eight<br />\nHandshakes, smiles, and slaps on<br />\nrejoins.<br />\nwent to college you know...that<br />\na.m.,<br />\nattended<br />\nby gentlemen who<br />\nbacks, and Lenny was out the<br />\n\"Yes,\" I say, \"but you are<br />\nI'm being, oh yeah, dishonest.\"<br />\nannounce<br />\nthemselves<br />\nas<br />\n\"Lenny's<br />\ndoor, pausing at the top of the<br />\nolder.\" Benjie acquiesces, starts<br />\n\"It'll work.

John<br />\nColmers, Student Assistant to the<br />\nDean, was dismayed that the<br />\nClass of 1941 was not notified<br />\nabout the removal of their<br />\ndonation. \"At least the class<br />\npresident should have been<br />\nnotified.

The benches are still<br />\na gift of the Class of '41.\"<br />\nHe compared this to a class<br />\ngift of a television. \"When the<br />\nappliance wears out and has to be<br />\nreplaced, no one notifies the class<br />\nthat made the gift,\" Campbell<br />\nexplained.<br />\nOne anonymous frequenter of<br />\nthe flagstone area expressed<br /><br />\nwould have replaced more of the<br />\nflagstone.\"<br />\n\"Unfortunately the material<br />\nthat was used there has<br />\npenetrated the stone,\" he added.<br />\n\"It would be nice if they could<br />\nbe removed so that other<br />\ndecorations would be possible.\"<br />\nAnother frequent user of the<br />\narea declared, \"They took away<br /><br />\nanxiety over the removal of some<br />\npieces of the \"pretty yellow<br />\nflowers\" left over from last year's<br />\nfair production of \"The Wizard<br />\nof Oz\".<br />\nCampbell responded that the<br />\nflagstones that were replaced had<br />\nbeen damaged by the traffic in<br />\nthe area. \"If the purpose had<br />\nbeen to remove the flowers we<br /><br />\nthe old, comfortable benches<br />\nbecause everyone used to sit<br />\nthere and smoke dope.

For example, there's emphasis on<br />\ngroup medicine and preventive medicine, and the<br />\ngrowing specialty of \"family physician.\" Whatever<br />\nyour interest, there are few specialties which are not<br />\nbeing practiced in today's Air Force.<br />\nThe physician starting his practice in civilian<br />\nlife has to take into account the cost of setting up an<br />\noffice.

This year's Urinus<br />\nsquad proved typical of past Bear<br />\nteams in both respects.<br />\nHopkins came out eager to<br />\nraise their I-1 record above the<br />\n.500 mark and the Blue Jays<br />\ndominated the first quater and<br />\npart of the second. However,<br />\nsimiliar to last week's Franklin<br /><br />\nadn Marshall game, the Jays<br />\nfailed to capitalize on early<br />\nscoring opportunities. Three such<br />\nopportunities occured in the first<br />\nquater alone. Twice Hopkins had<br />\nfirst-and-goal situations within<br />\nthe Urinus ten-yard line only to<br />\ncome up empty-handed each<br />\ntime. The third scoring chance<br />\ncame when, once again a Hopkins<br />\noffensive drive was stalled deep<br />\nin Ursinus territory by a tough<br />\nBears defense, but this time the<br />\nBlue Jays attempted a field goal<br />\non the fourth down.

The<br />\nfirst quater which could have<br />\nended with Hopkins leading 21-0<br />\ninstead closed scoreless.<br />\n\"That first quater made a big<br />\ndifference,\" according to Coach<br />\nDennis Cox.\" They were bigger<br />\nand stronger than us but we<br />\nplayed well and dominated the<br />\nfirst quater and the early part of<br />\nthe second. But after they<br />\nstopped us on those 3 scoring<br />\ndrives, they really got the idea<br />\nthat they could beat us. Also<br />\nplaying in front of their parents<br />\nand friends (it was Parents Day at<br />\nUrsinus) always makes a team<br />\nplay harder. They got inspired<br />\nand began playing better. They<br /><br />\nplayed over-their-heads, I think, 3 interceptions.
