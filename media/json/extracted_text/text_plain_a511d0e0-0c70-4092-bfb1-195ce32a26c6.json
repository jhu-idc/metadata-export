Two of the policies advocated by our predecessor<br />\nwere a three-week rushing season, and the outlawing of \"mud-slinging.\" These problems are being fully discussed and some action along<br />\nthese lines may be expected shortly.<br />\nHowever there is another group of these reforms and policies which<br />\nhave not be followed. This group includes:<br />\n1. Active and continued support of the movement for the erection<br />\nof a cage on the campus in the near future.<br />\n2. Complete abolition of the practice of allowing inexperienced<br />\ngraduate students to grade quiz papers.<br />\n<br />\n' 3.

A more careful and general use of the University calendar to<br />\n<br />\navoid conflicts.<br />\nOne of the changes advocated by our immediate predecessor was<br />\ncompleted when the black list was abolished. There are two other<br />\nnotable reforms suggested that have not as yet been carried into effect.<br />\nThese are the admittance of students in the College of Arts and Sciences to a larger number of courses in the School of Business Economics, and a considerable increase in the number of courses offered<br />\nto undergraduates.<br />\nA year ago the NEWS-LETTER favored either the abolition or enforcement of freshman regulations. After witnessing a season of the<br />\nformer, we now strongly favor the latter. Freshman regulations to a<br />\nlimited extent should be re-established. The first-year men should be<br />\ncompelled to greet all those whom they meet on the campus, to attend<br />\nall football games, and to wear some distinctive button or article of<br />\nclothing the enforcement of these regulations should be in the hands<br />\nof the Student Council, or a committee elected solely for this purpose<br />\nby the entire student body. This would eliminate all the unpleasantness connected with a sophomore pep committee.
