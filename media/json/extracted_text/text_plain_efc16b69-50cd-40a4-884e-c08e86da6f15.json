We called the offices of the railroad in an attempt<br />\nto arrange a trip on \u2022 one of its<br />\ntrains.<br />\n\"We would like to ride the train<br />\nto York\" we said, intending to<br />\ntravel to what we had heard was<br />\nthe railroad's other extremity.<br />\n\"You can't,\" we were told.<br />\n\"Why not,\" we asked?<br />\n\"There is no train to York,\" the<br />\nvoice explained tolerantly.<br />\n\"The train only runs as far as<br />\nTowson today.\"<br />\n\"Well then, we would like to<br />\nride to Towson,\" we said hesitating a bit.<br />\n\"You can't do that either,\" the<br />\nvoice insisted.<br />\n\"Why can't we,\" we asked?<br />\n\"We have no passenger facilities,\" the voice concluded.<br />\n<br />\nversations with the personnel. We<br />\nheaded towards the station's offices on West North Avenue. But<br />\nwhere the offices should have<br />\nbeen we found only a covered<br />\nwooden staircase leading down<br />\nfrom the Howard Street Bridge.<br />\nOn the staircase was a sign indicating that below was the passenger terminal of the Ma & Pa. Below, there was nothing; two very<br />\nlight rails roughly parallel to one<br />\nanother, passed a faded gray<br />\nstructure resembling a closed<br />\nlean-to. The gray structure bore<br />\nthe faded words \"waiting room.\"<br />\nWe turned and followed the track<br />\ninto a lumber-supply house, where<br />\nwe lost it. The next two and one<br />\nhalf hours were spent in search of<br />\nthe Ma. & Pa. We finally retraced<br />\nour steps past the lean-to some<br />\none-thousand yards to a larger,<br />\nmore elaborate edifice. This was<br />\nthe freight center.

The middle is<br />\nvery seldom used, making signals<br />\nunnecessary.<br />\nWe were much relieved to find<br />\nthat the railroad had not been con\"<br />\nverted to peanut oil, as has been<br />\nrumored, but is running for the<br />\nmost part, on ultra-conventional<br />\ndiesel-fuel. Mr. Bastress produced<br />\na full scrapbook of railroad mere'<br />\norabilia which included pictures<br />\nof several self-propelled gasoline<br />\nrailcars. \"One of these ran on dia'<br />\ntillate,\" he noted, \"but the distillate seeped through to the crank\"<br />\ncase and we had to change the oil<br />\n<br />\nevery 77 miles.\"<br />\nIt was during the war that the<br />\nPublic Service Commission tried to<br />\nget the Ma & Pa to increase its<br />\ncommuter service. \"We had t\u00b0<br />\nshow them it couldn't be done,<br />\nhand examination and from con- immediately introduced to Mr. A. said Mr. Bastress. \"We took a poll<br />\n<br />\nThe eviction of Musial-Lidz from these columns is imminent<br />\nInauspicious<br />\n(editorial navel and all).

It is not an<br />\nattempt on the part of some disappointed candidates to get<br />\nanother chance.

We called the offices of the railroad in an attempt<br />\nto arrange a trip on \u2022 one of its<br />\ntrains.<br />\n\"We would like to ride the train<br />\nto York\" we said, intending to<br />\ntravel to what we had heard was<br />\nthe railroad's other extremity.<br />\n\"You can't,\" we were told.<br />\n\"Why not,\" we asked?<br />\n\"There is no train to York,\" the<br />\nvoice explained tolerantly.<br />\n\"The train only runs as far as<br />\nTowson today.\"<br />\n\"Well then, we would like to<br />\nride to Towson,\" we said hesitating a bit.<br />\n\"You can't do that either,\" the<br />\nvoice insisted.<br />\n\"Why can't we,\" we asked?<br />\n\"We have no passenger facilities,\" the voice concluded.<br /><br />\nversations with the personnel. We<br />\nheaded towards the station's offices on West North Avenue. But<br />\nwhere the offices should have<br />\nbeen we found only a covered<br />\nwooden staircase leading down<br />\nfrom the Howard Street Bridge.<br />\nOn the staircase was a sign indicating that below was the passenger terminal of the Ma &amp; Pa. Below, there was nothing; two very<br />\nlight rails roughly parallel to one<br />\nanother, passed a faded gray<br />\nstructure resembling a closed<br />\nlean-to. The gray structure bore<br />\nthe faded words \"waiting room.\"<br />\nWe turned and followed the track<br />\ninto a lumber-supply house, where<br />\nwe lost it. The next two and one<br />\nhalf hours were spent in search of<br />\nthe Ma. &amp; Pa. We finally retraced<br />\nour steps past the lean-to some<br />\none-thousand yards to a larger,<br />\nmore elaborate edifice. This was<br />\nthe freight center.
