The trouble is due,<br />\nnot to the faults of managers or leaders, but<br />\naltogether to the sure and steady decrease in<br />\nundergraduate interest which has taken<br />\nPlace in recent years. Five years ago it was<br />\nconsidered an honor to be on the Clubs,<br />\nthere were plenty of candidates, the concerts<br />\nwere well attended. Now, there is no Banjo<br />\nClub, and the members of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs have literally to be dragged out<br />\nto rehearsals, and be begged on bended knee<br />\nnot to leave the clubs in the lurch on the<br />\nnext trip. As for coming out to concerts,<br />\nalmost the only undergraduates that we see<br />\nthere are the ushers and those that manage<br />\nto pull a free ticket. When there are plenty<br />\nof good men in the University who stubbornly refuse to come out for the clubs, we naturally ask: \"Is this important branch of college activity going to die out at Hopkins?\"<br />\nIf present conditions persist, it undoubtedly<br />\nwill, and perhaps it will be a good thing. It<br />\nis certainly a great thing to have the Musical<br />\nClubs, but if the members have the feeling<br />\nthat they are doing great favors by gracing<br />\nthe clubs with their presence, and if the<br />\nundergraduate body refuses to support the<br />\nclubs, it is certainly better that they be<br />\nabandoned.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nHERE seems to be a good deal of probability that this year's ball team will<br />\nbe a creditable organization. However, the usual doubts as to whether the team<br />\nwill look as well in ball togs, as on paper, are<br />\nstill unsettled. A baseball nine can seldom<br />\nbe sized up until after its initial game, and<br />\neven at that time, any prophesy is generally<br />\nopen to amendment.<br />\nIn our own case, we believe that the matter<br />\nhas been needlessly complicated. It has been<br />\nthe custom, down to the present time, to give<br />\nto the press more or less eulogistic accounts<br />\nof every man who came out for the squad,<br />\nalthough the latter possessed many candidates who would find it impossible to make<br />\na good prep. school team. We believe that<br />\nthis has had an unfortunate effect upon the<br />\nmorale of the whole team. The misleading<br />\naccounts which were published afforded no<br />\nincentive to the less skillful players, and took<br />\naway a great deal of incentive from the faster men.<br />\nThe reason for this result lies in the game<br />\nof baseball itself. In fact, we believe that<br />\neven had the lacrosse management pursued<br />\nthe same policy in regard to lacrosse accounts as does the baseball management, the<br />\nharm would only have been nominal. With<br />\nno intention of slurring lacrosse, it may be<br />\nsaid that, all things being equal, you can<br />\ntrain a man to play that game, while good<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nbaseball players are born and not made.<br />\nAn every day \"stick at it\" policy will be<br />\nproductive of infinitely surer returns in lacrosse than ,in baseball. The almost hopelessly unskilled man may be a future factor in<br />\nlacrosse, but never in baseball. The reports<br />\nof the progress of the ball team which get to<br />\nthe papers are too few, especially this year,<br />\nwhen a really fine schedule has been secured,<br />\nand the few that are printed are inaccurate.<br />\nThe first fact is unfortunate from the financial side, and the second is harmful to the<br />\nteam as a whole. Baseball will have a greater<br />\nfollowing at the University if short-sighted<br />\npolicies were abandoned.<br />\nBut after all has been said, the chief question as to results of the coming baseball season rests entirely on whether or not the fifteen or so good men who are out for the<br />\nteam play regularly and conscientiously together. If they really try to play to the<br />\nutmost of their abilities, and work together<br />\nwith good spirit, we entertain no fear as to<br />\nthe result of their efforts. At the present<br />\nstage, there seems more ground to believe<br />\nthat the team of 1906 will \"make good\" than<br />\nhas been the case for many years.<br />\n<br />\nwill tell you he doesn't know. Ask the<br />\nchairman of the banquet committee and he<br />\nis more ignorant than anyone else. Freshmen are ignorant and everyone knows it.<br />\nBut the Freshman ignorance is not bliss.<br />\nPoor scared little devils, holding meetings<br />\nin out of the way places! They have a hard<br />\ntime, but with all their meetings they are<br />\nstill ignorant and lose even the slight signs<br />\nof human intelligence which they are credited<br />\nwith.<br />\nBut really the Juniors are the only ones<br />\nwho know anything about the Freshman Banquet\u2014in fact they know everything\u2014date,<br />\nplace, toastmaster, toasts and what not.<br />\nThe chairman of the Freshman Banquet<br />\ncommittee made the following statement for<br />\nthe benefit of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n\"I do not know when the banquet will take<br />\nplace, it has not been decided. We have a<br />\nnumber of dates which seem suitable but we<br />\nare afraid of offending some of them by<br />\nshowing a marked preference for any particular one.

Why have these \"meetings\" not materialized; or if they have done so, why can<br />\nwe not learn any news of them? Certainly<br />\nthe matter ought to be at least given a fair<br />\nhearing, and to be put to open vote. The<br />\nplan is certainly of sufficient importance to<br />\nbe afforded serious consideration. We sincerely hope, therefore, that the committee<br />\nof the Senior Class, which is in charge of the<br />\nmatter, may decide upon some definite plan,<br />\nand put it to definite vote. Until some definite. action is taken, we can certainly not<br />\nlearn what the sentiment of the student body<br />\nreally is.<br />\n\"How much good does the college man<br />\nget from his college course after he has gone<br />\ninto business?\"<br />\nThis question has been debated at great<br />\nlength and with, of course, no settled verdict.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nIt has remained for a successful business<br />\nhouse of Chicago, Hart, Schaffner and Marx,<br />\nto put this to the test.

A large portion of<br />\nthe work on the athletic field of the University has been done, $5000 having been expended up to the present. There is a desire to complete the work in a satisfactory<br />\nmanner, which it is estimated would require<br />\nabout $10,000. Letters have been sent to the<br />\nalumni and friends of the Hopkins calling<br />\nattention to the beautiful situation of the<br />\nathletic field, which is to be arranged in a<br />\nmanner suitable to the proposed plans for<br />\nthe development of Homewood. The development of the athletic field, it is shown, will<br />\nbe of direct benefit to the larger plans of the<br />\nUniversity. This letter asks for immediate<br />\ncontributions. Those who are unable to give<br />\na cash contribution as large as they would<br />\nlike are asked to pledge themselves to annual contributions of $25, $10 or $5 for a<br />\nperiod of five years. The letter explains<br />\nthat if a sufficient number of pledges are<br />\nreceived, arrangements will be made with<br />\ninterests friendly to the University to advance on the subscriptions the money immediately needed for the work.<br />\nImmediate answer to the appeal is requested by the committee having charge of<br />\nthe matter, as the time is approaching at<br />\nwhich the most progress can be made on the<br />\nwork. Every effort will be made to push<br />\nthings during the spring and summer, so<br />\nthat everything will be completed by October.<br />\nThe $5000 already expended on the<br />\ngrounds was supplied by contributions from<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Athletic Association,<br />\nsupplemented by a gift from the University.<br />\nThe money was expended under the supervision of a committee. This committee submitted a report of its work, together with<br />\nrecommendations, at a meeting of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Club, Johns Hopkins Athletic Association and Johns Hopkins Alumni Associa-<br />\n<br />\ntion held at the Johns Hopkins Club on February 14. At this meeting a committee was<br />\nappointed to appeal to the alumni and friends<br />\nof the University for the sum necessary to<br />\ncomplete the work. The committee having<br />\nthe contributions in charge consists of<br />\nMessrs. Edward Renouf (chairman), B.<br />\nHowell Griswold, Jr., Theodore L. Straus,<br />\nStuart S. Janney, Douglas H.

Although embarassed<br />\nto a great extent by the failure of some of<br />\nthe members to show up for the annual<br />\nChristmas trip, and the consequent necessity<br />\nfor cancelling two of the four concerts in<br />\nthe itinerary of the trip, the management<br />\nhas been able to meet all its expenses, and<br />\nhopes to be able to wipe out a part of the<br />\nimmense debt hanging over from last year.<br />\nConsidering these prospects, the management decided after the joint concert with<br />\nthe University of Virginia, that it would be<br />\ntoo great a risk to attempt the customary<br />\n\"Baltimore Concert,\" as such an attempt<br />\nwould necessitate the expenditure of a large<br />\nsum of money or credit, with but little assurance that the same people who heard the<br />\njoint concert by Hopkins and Virginia would<br />\nbe willing to attend a second concert by the<br />\nlatter organization alone. 'Therefore, unless<br />\nsome very attractive offers present themselves, the Hopkins-Virginia concert may be<br />\nconsidered the farewell appearance of the<br />\nMusical Clubs this year.<br />\nAs to next year, all will depend on the<br />\nincoming freshman class, and upon any revival of spirit among the old members of the<br />\nclubs whether it will be advisable to attempt<br />\nan organization next year. The Mandolin<br />\nClub, which even this year was too small,<br />\nwill be depleted by the loss of its present<br />\nleader and several of his ablest men, and the<br />\nGlee Club, unless it can depend more than<br />\never on the Medical School, will be in the<br />\nsame position. Again, granting that plenty<br />\nof material will be forthcoming, it would be<br />\nuseless for the future management to arrange<br />\na schedule of concerts unless the members<br />\nof the clubs can be depended upon to realize,<br />\nthat, as members of the clubs, they are bound<br />\nby honor to live up to the contracts made<br />\nby the management.<br />\nIn putting the situation before the members of the student body, I have been forced,<br />\nby the gravity of the situation and for the<br />\nsake of the Clubs' future, to be perfectly<br />\n<br />\nfrank. It is by no means my intention, however, to create a feeling of pessimism. On<br />\nthe contrary, I feel confident that once the<br />\nstudents see the situation in its true light,<br />\nthey will make every successful endeavor to<br />\nform an organization next year which will<br />\nrival and surpass any of the organizations<br />\nof previous years. While we depend on our<br />\nathletic teams to bring us into prominence<br />\nbefore the athletic world, we are at the same<br />\ntime largely dependent on the Musical Clubs<br />\nfor the social pleasures of student life at the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nT.

How I long to bury<br />\nmy teeth in his throat and suck the warm,<br />\nsweet blood But I can't. I am separated<br />\nfrom his by this iron grating. And always,<br />\nalways, I tell you, he paces up and down before my cell, and lets the brass buttons on<br />\nhis coat burn like glowing coals into my<br />\neyes, causing my poor head to ache so.<br />\nBut I am not crazy, I tell you. I swear it.<br />\nListen\u2014does a madman think?<br />\nDoes a<br />\nmaniac feel? Does a lunatic plan and plan<br />\nand plan? I plan, night and day I plan how<br />\nI can find a way to suck the keeper's blood.<br />\nAh! the nice feast of blood I once had, long,<br />\nso long ago. Sit still. I am calm and will<br />\ntell you quietly.<br />\nShe was my mother. Tall and fair, and<br />\nso kind and good. Oh, I loved her passionately, my sweet mother. I proved it. But<br />\nit was her veins, her large blue veins that<br />\nI hated. They crossed and recrossed her<br />\npretty hands. It was damnable that she<br />\nkept those veins there when I loved her so.<br />\nAnd they would fill at times, oh so much.<br />\nAnd stand out from her hands, and beat,<br />\nbeat, beat. But I rid myself of their presence<br />\nfinally\u2014ha! ha! But I had to plan, oh, so<br />\nlong, before I found the means, and then I<br />\nwent to work. I knew she had too much<br />\nblood, and I determined to suck her veins<br />\nempty\u2014ha! ha!\u2014then I would lose that<br />\nhaunting terror. But listen! There were<br />\nalways people, other people with her, and I<br />\n<br />\nB<br />\n<br />\ndid not want to share her blood with anyone<br />\nelse. It should be mine, all mine, for was<br />\nnot the idea mine? Even at night I was<br />\nthwarted, for my father was in the same<br />\nroom, and he was a poor sleeper, and delicate. He did not have much blood. I<br />\nlaughed when I thought how much he would<br />\nlike to share my mother's blood with me.<br />\nMy room adjoined theirs, and every night<br />\nfor a fortnight after I had made my plans,<br />\nI would creep, easily, softly, to the door of<br />\ntheir room and listen. I would wrap thick<br />\nsheets about my chest, for my heart beat<br />\nloudly, and I was afraid she would hear.<br />\nMy father did hear the thump, thump of my<br />\nheart for every night just as I would put<br />\nmy foot on the door-sill he would stir. Then<br />\nI would have to go back, slowly, softly to<br />\nmy bed and hush the beating of my heart in<br />\nthe bed-coverings. As the fortnight waned,<br />\nI grew more and more anxious to carry out<br />\nmy plan, and it was almost with difficulty<br />\nthat I composed myself when I went to get<br />\nthe regular morning kiss from my mother.<br />\nBut luck came at last on the fourteenth<br />\nnight. My father had been ill, and they had<br />\ngiven him a sleeping potion. How I chuckled<br />\nwhen the doctor left the house! How joyously I went to kiss my mother before going<br />\nto my room that night. Her warm breath<br />\nlulled me as I bent over to kiss her. But as<br />\nI did so she raised her hands and I saw the<br />\nveins. How they mocked me! Fury filled<br />\nmy breast and tore my soul. My own blood<br />\nrushed to my head, and as at night, my heart<br />\nbegan, thump\u2014thump\u2014thump. I knew the<br />\nbeating would be heard by her, and I hurried<br />\nfrom the room. She did not know, she did<br />\nnot suspect\u2014ha! ha! I am too clever for<br />\nthat. I hid my emotions, oh! so well.<br />\nHurriedly I tore off my clothes, put out my<br />\nlight, and got into bed. A cricket was chirping outside, and I was glad, for that would<br />\nhelp to deaden the noise of my heart. . .<br />\nI listened! I heard my mother ascend the<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nstairs, and enter her room. I bit my tongue<br />\nto keep from screaming with delight. And<br />\nstill the cricket chirped louder and louder.<br />\nLong, ohl so long afterwards, the creaking<br />\nsound told me that my mother had gotten<br />\ninto bed, and then the slow minutes began<br />\nto creep by. The cricket must have made<br />\nover a thousand chirps before I finally concluded that my mother had gone to sleep\u2014I<br />\nwas so patient. Then quietly, real quietly,<br />\nI slipped out of bed. To-night I wrapped<br />\nthe blanket, instead of a sheet over my nightclothes, and the beating of my heart was not<br />\nso loud. Then, you see, the cricket\u2014the<br />\ngood cricket\u2014kept on chirping louder and<br />\nlouder.<br />\nI had opened my mother's door, and stood<br />\nin her room. I stopped a moment to assure<br />\nmyself that her breath was regular. The<br />\nmoon had slipped behind a cloud and there<br />\nwas only light enough coming through the<br />\nwindow to distinguish the dim outlines of<br />\nmy sleeping parents. My mother was nearer<br />\nthe window, and as the moon came out from<br />\nunder the cloud, I saw that she was smiling<br />\n<br />\n(To the tune of<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nin her sleep. Oh! such a sweet smile, and<br />\nhow I loved her!<br />\nMy foot must have shifted to a loose board<br />\nin the flooring for she stirred and slowly<br />\nAt first she<br />\nopened her beautiful eyes.<br />\nstared in a half conscious way at the ceiling,<br />\nbut as consciousness returned, her eyes<br />\ngradually shifted to the door where I was<br />\nstanding. For a moment she seemed transfixed, and then slowly terror crept into her<br />\neyes, as she gazed at the white outlines of<br />\nmy figure. I chuckled softly at heart, for<br />\nI knew now that the same fascination held<br />\nher, that always made my eyes seek her veincovered hands. Ah, those veins\u2014those full<br />\nveins! The moonlight was creeping down<br />\nthe length of her body, and just then fell<br />\nupon her clenched hands. The hideous veins<br />\n\u2014how they stuck out! I grew furious\u2014they<br />\nmocked me.<br />\nWith one piercing scream I sprung at her,<br />\nand bore her to the floor. Ha! ha! she was<br />\nso weak, my sweet mother. What could she<br />\ndo when I plunged my teeth into her warm<br />\nhands?

With last year's reputation to sustain, the men put forth their best efforts and<br />\nthe result was that the Black and Blue team<br />\nwon the meet easily with 23 points to their<br />\ncredit. The relay team won the match race<br />\nwith George Washington in handy style and<br />\nmade the fastest time of the evening.<br />\nIn the races the Hopkins runners were<br />\ngreatly handicapped by the slippery condition of the track and the construction of<br />\nthe banks, which were arranged differently<br />\nthan they had been before.<br />\nThe first event of the night went to Hopkins. Branham and Lynch qualified in the<br />\n50 yard novice, and in the final heat Lynch<br />\nwon by a good margin in the fast time of<br />\n514 seconds.<br />\nThe half mile scratch went to Hopkins<br />\nthrough default of other runners. Lynch,<br />\nMeyers and Brenton trotted around the track<br />\nat their leisure, and in the final spurt Brenton won, followed by Lynch and Meyers.<br />\nKnight kept up the good work by winning<br />\nthe 50 yard hurdles in easy style.<br />\nIn the mile run, which was won by Sheppard in 4 min., 23 sec., Breyer, J. H. U., and<br />\nBrenton, J. H. U., won second and third<br />\nplaces respectively.<br />\nThe relay race was the next to last thing<br />\non the program, and proved to be a walkover. Each runner gained from 8 to 10<br />\nyards in his turn, and Hunter finished about<br />\n<br />\n40 yards ahead of Lorando, last man on the<br />\nGeorge Washington team.<br />\nThe time, 2.35, was the fastest of the evening, and considering the condition of the<br />\ntrack and the fact that the runners were not<br />\nallowed to use spiked shoes, it compares favorably with any time ever mad eat Georgetown by a Hopkins team.<br />\n'The relay team consisted of Perce, '07,<br />\nStewart, '07, Padgett, '07, and Hunter, '07<br />\n(capt.).<br />\n<br />\nBASEBALL.<br />\nWith its first game less than ten days off,<br />\nthe baseball team is fast rounding into shape.<br />\nRegular practices have been held in the cage<br />\non Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays,<br />\nand while all the practices have not been<br />\nfully attended, yet they have proved most<br />\nuseful in getting a line on the capabilities of<br />\nthe candidates. The first outdoor practice<br />\nwill probably be held on Thursday, and from<br />\nthen on Oriole Park will be substituted for<br />\nthe cage.<br />\nOf the new men out for the team, Webb<br />\nand Watkins seem the most promising.<br />\nWebb has been catching in great style, and<br />\nwill undoubtedly be seen behind the bat.<br />\nThe finger which he broke in practice several weeks ago, is almost well again, and<br />\nprobably will be entirely so by the time of<br />\nthe Dickinson game. One of the weak spots<br />\nin last year's nine was the position of catcher,<br />\nbut this year it promises to be one of the<br />\nstrongest positions on the team.<br />\nWatkins looks like a \"find\" in the twirling line, and has both speed and curves.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nHowever, his control is somewhat of an unknown quantity, and it will largely depend<br />\non this whether he will be the mainstay in<br />\nthe box. Campbell, fortunately, can be relied upon to pitch steady, consistent ball, and<br />\nthen Waring, who made such a good showing last year under adverse circumstances,<br />\nis decidedly in the running. At the present<br />\nmoment, the Black and Blue battery is not<br />\ncausing the coaches any worry, and promises<br />\nto be far superior to that possessed by any<br />\nHopkins ball team for many years past.<br />\nThe infield is not so easy to pick. Bowie<br />\nis a good man at third, but is sometimes erratic, and it seems probable that Campbell<br />\nwill hold down that bag, when he is not<br />\npitching. At second, Budd and Iglehart<br />\nseem to be the most promising candidates,<br />\nwhile short and first base are positions about<br />\nwhich it would be impossible to make any<br />\ncertain decisions. Lyon can undoubtedly<br />\nhave centre field if he wants it, but at present he is trying for short. There are<br />\nenough candidates for the other two field<br />\npositions to justify the belief that they will<br />\nbe well and thoroughly looked after.<br />\nAltogether the prospects for a good team<br />\nare very bright. The only question is<br />\nwhether all the men who are trying for the<br />\nteam will come out regularly to practice and<br />\nwork conscientiously. There is no reason<br />\nwhy this should not be the case, and, as a<br />\nmatter of fact, this year the management is<br />\ngoing to pick consistent, rather than brilliant<br />\nplayers. In fact, this is the only way in<br />\nwhich the team can ever be welded together<br />\nas a unit, and unless the team is a unit, it<br />\ncan never hope to cope successfully with its<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nTHE JUNIOR BANQUET.<br />\n<br />\nThe Junior Banquet, which was held last<br />\nFriday was a thorough success. The Eutaw<br />\nHouse did itself proud, and as the company<br />\ndid not sit down until half-past nine, they<br />\nwere ready to do the menu ample justice.<br />\nThe one gloomy event of the evening was the<br />\nsudden illness of one of the banqueters,<br />\nbrought on by the heat and smoke. Copious<br />\nadministration of cold water over his bare<br />\nbody had to be resorted to before he returned to his senses. The decorations were<br />\nvery attractive, and the bacchanal wreaths<br />\nworn by some lent charm and color to the<br />\nscene.<br />\nAfter the \"garbage had been mangled\"<br />\n(apologies to Kipling), various toasts were<br />\nresponded to. Mr. Raleigh on the \"Junior<br />\nGirl\" was especially snappy, and Mr.<br />\nSchmeisser's account of lacrosse at Hopkins,<br />\nfrom the earliest times to the present day,<br />\nwas both interesting and instructive.<br />\nHere is the list in full:<br />\nFrederick B.

The trouble is due,<br />\nnot to the faults of managers or leaders, but<br />\naltogether to the sure and steady decrease in<br />\nundergraduate interest which has taken<br />\nPlace in recent years. Five years ago it was<br />\nconsidered an honor to be on the Clubs,<br />\nthere were plenty of candidates, the concerts<br />\nwere well attended. Now, there is no Banjo<br />\nClub, and the members of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs have literally to be dragged out<br />\nto rehearsals, and be begged on bended knee<br />\nnot to leave the clubs in the lurch on the<br />\nnext trip. As for coming out to concerts,<br />\nalmost the only undergraduates that we see<br />\nthere are the ushers and those that manage<br />\nto pull a free ticket. When there are plenty<br />\nof good men in the University who stubbornly refuse to come out for the clubs, we naturally ask: \"Is this important branch of college activity going to die out at Hopkins?\"<br />\nIf present conditions persist, it undoubtedly<br />\nwill, and perhaps it will be a good thing. It<br />\nis certainly a great thing to have the Musical<br />\nClubs, but if the members have the feeling<br />\nthat they are doing great favors by gracing<br />\nthe clubs with their presence, and if the<br />\nundergraduate body refuses to support the<br />\nclubs, it is certainly better that they be<br />\nabandoned.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nHERE seems to be a good deal of probability that this year's ball team will<br />\nbe a creditable organization. However, the usual doubts as to whether the team<br />\nwill look as well in ball togs, as on paper, are<br />\nstill unsettled. A baseball nine can seldom<br />\nbe sized up until after its initial game, and<br />\neven at that time, any prophesy is generally<br />\nopen to amendment.<br />\nIn our own case, we believe that the matter<br />\nhas been needlessly complicated. It has been<br />\nthe custom, down to the present time, to give<br />\nto the press more or less eulogistic accounts<br />\nof every man who came out for the squad,<br />\nalthough the latter possessed many candidates who would find it impossible to make<br />\na good prep. school team. We believe that<br />\nthis has had an unfortunate effect upon the<br />\nmorale of the whole team. The misleading<br />\naccounts which were published afforded no<br />\nincentive to the less skillful players, and took<br />\naway a great deal of incentive from the faster men.<br />\nThe reason for this result lies in the game<br />\nof baseball itself. In fact, we believe that<br />\neven had the lacrosse management pursued<br />\nthe same policy in regard to lacrosse accounts as does the baseball management, the<br />\nharm would only have been nominal. With<br />\nno intention of slurring lacrosse, it may be<br />\nsaid that, all things being equal, you can<br />\ntrain a man to play that game, while good<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nbaseball players are born and not made.<br />\nAn every day \"stick at it\" policy will be<br />\nproductive of infinitely surer returns in lacrosse than ,in baseball. The almost hopelessly unskilled man may be a future factor in<br />\nlacrosse, but never in baseball. The reports<br />\nof the progress of the ball team which get to<br />\nthe papers are too few, especially this year,<br />\nwhen a really fine schedule has been secured,<br />\nand the few that are printed are inaccurate.<br />\nThe first fact is unfortunate from the financial side, and the second is harmful to the<br />\nteam as a whole. Baseball will have a greater<br />\nfollowing at the University if short-sighted<br />\npolicies were abandoned.<br />\nBut after all has been said, the chief question as to results of the coming baseball season rests entirely on whether or not the fifteen or so good men who are out for the<br />\nteam play regularly and conscientiously together. If they really try to play to the<br />\nutmost of their abilities, and work together<br />\nwith good spirit, we entertain no fear as to<br />\nthe result of their efforts. At the present<br />\nstage, there seems more ground to believe<br />\nthat the team of 1906 will \"make good\" than<br />\nhas been the case for many years.<br /><br />\nwill tell you he doesn't know. Ask the<br />\nchairman of the banquet committee and he<br />\nis more ignorant than anyone else. Freshmen are ignorant and everyone knows it.<br />\nBut the Freshman ignorance is not bliss.<br />\nPoor scared little devils, holding meetings<br />\nin out of the way places! They have a hard<br />\ntime, but with all their meetings they are<br />\nstill ignorant and lose even the slight signs<br />\nof human intelligence which they are credited<br />\nwith.<br />\nBut really the Juniors are the only ones<br />\nwho know anything about the Freshman Banquet\u2014in fact they know everything\u2014date,<br />\nplace, toastmaster, toasts and what not.<br />\nThe chairman of the Freshman Banquet<br />\ncommittee made the following statement for<br />\nthe benefit of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n\"I do not know when the banquet will take<br />\nplace, it has not been decided. We have a<br />\nnumber of dates which seem suitable but we<br />\nare afraid of offending some of them by<br />\nshowing a marked preference for any particular one.

Why have these \"meetings\" not materialized; or if they have done so, why can<br />\nwe not learn any news of them? Certainly<br />\nthe matter ought to be at least given a fair<br />\nhearing, and to be put to open vote. The<br />\nplan is certainly of sufficient importance to<br />\nbe afforded serious consideration. We sincerely hope, therefore, that the committee<br />\nof the Senior Class, which is in charge of the<br />\nmatter, may decide upon some definite plan,<br />\nand put it to definite vote. Until some definite. action is taken, we can certainly not<br />\nlearn what the sentiment of the student body<br />\nreally is.<br />\n\"How much good does the college man<br />\nget from his college course after he has gone<br />\ninto business?\"<br />\nThis question has been debated at great<br />\nlength and with, of course, no settled verdict.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nIt has remained for a successful business<br />\nhouse of Chicago, Hart, Schaffner and Marx,<br />\nto put this to the test.

A large portion of<br />\nthe work on the athletic field of the University has been done, $5000 having been expended up to the present. There is a desire to complete the work in a satisfactory<br />\nmanner, which it is estimated would require<br />\nabout $10,000. Letters have been sent to the<br />\nalumni and friends of the Hopkins calling<br />\nattention to the beautiful situation of the<br />\nathletic field, which is to be arranged in a<br />\nmanner suitable to the proposed plans for<br />\nthe development of Homewood. The development of the athletic field, it is shown, will<br />\nbe of direct benefit to the larger plans of the<br />\nUniversity. This letter asks for immediate<br />\ncontributions. Those who are unable to give<br />\na cash contribution as large as they would<br />\nlike are asked to pledge themselves to annual contributions of $25, $10 or $5 for a<br />\nperiod of five years. The letter explains<br />\nthat if a sufficient number of pledges are<br />\nreceived, arrangements will be made with<br />\ninterests friendly to the University to advance on the subscriptions the money immediately needed for the work.<br />\nImmediate answer to the appeal is requested by the committee having charge of<br />\nthe matter, as the time is approaching at<br />\nwhich the most progress can be made on the<br />\nwork. Every effort will be made to push<br />\nthings during the spring and summer, so<br />\nthat everything will be completed by October.<br />\nThe $5000 already expended on the<br />\ngrounds was supplied by contributions from<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Athletic Association,<br />\nsupplemented by a gift from the University.<br />\nThe money was expended under the supervision of a committee. This committee submitted a report of its work, together with<br />\nrecommendations, at a meeting of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Club, Johns Hopkins Athletic Association and Johns Hopkins Alumni Associa-<br /><br />\ntion held at the Johns Hopkins Club on February 14. At this meeting a committee was<br />\nappointed to appeal to the alumni and friends<br />\nof the University for the sum necessary to<br />\ncomplete the work.

Although embarassed<br />\nto a great extent by the failure of some of<br />\nthe members to show up for the annual<br />\nChristmas trip, and the consequent necessity<br />\nfor cancelling two of the four concerts in<br />\nthe itinerary of the trip, the management<br />\nhas been able to meet all its expenses, and<br />\nhopes to be able to wipe out a part of the<br />\nimmense debt hanging over from last year.<br />\nConsidering these prospects, the management decided after the joint concert with<br />\nthe University of Virginia, that it would be<br />\ntoo great a risk to attempt the customary<br />\n\"Baltimore Concert,\" as such an attempt<br />\nwould necessitate the expenditure of a large<br />\nsum of money or credit, with but little assurance that the same people who heard the<br />\njoint concert by Hopkins and Virginia would<br />\nbe willing to attend a second concert by the<br />\nlatter organization alone. 'Therefore, unless<br />\nsome very attractive offers present themselves, the Hopkins-Virginia concert may be<br />\nconsidered the farewell appearance of the<br />\nMusical Clubs this year.<br />\nAs to next year, all will depend on the<br />\nincoming freshman class, and upon any revival of spirit among the old members of the<br />\nclubs whether it will be advisable to attempt<br />\nan organization next year. The Mandolin<br />\nClub, which even this year was too small,<br />\nwill be depleted by the loss of its present<br />\nleader and several of his ablest men, and the<br />\nGlee Club, unless it can depend more than<br />\never on the Medical School, will be in the<br />\nsame position. Again, granting that plenty<br />\nof material will be forthcoming, it would be<br />\nuseless for the future management to arrange<br />\na schedule of concerts unless the members<br />\nof the clubs can be depended upon to realize,<br />\nthat, as members of the clubs, they are bound<br />\nby honor to live up to the contracts made<br />\nby the management.<br />\nIn putting the situation before the members of the student body, I have been forced,<br />\nby the gravity of the situation and for the<br />\nsake of the Clubs' future, to be perfectly<br /><br />\nfrank. It is by no means my intention, however, to create a feeling of pessimism. On<br />\nthe contrary, I feel confident that once the<br />\nstudents see the situation in its true light,<br />\nthey will make every successful endeavor to<br />\nform an organization next year which will<br />\nrival and surpass any of the organizations<br />\nof previous years. While we depend on our<br />\nathletic teams to bring us into prominence<br />\nbefore the athletic world, we are at the same<br />\ntime largely dependent on the Musical Clubs<br />\nfor the social pleasures of student life at the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nT.

How I hate him\u2014he is so sleek,<br />\nso fat\u2014 his damned pudgy fingers cushioned<br />\nwith veins\u2014veins full of warm blood\u2014<br />\nsweet delicious blood! How I long to bury<br />\nmy teeth in his throat and suck the warm,<br />\nsweet blood But I can't. I am separated<br />\nfrom his by this iron grating. And always,<br />\nalways, I tell you, he paces up and down before my cell, and lets the brass buttons on<br />\nhis coat burn like glowing coals into my<br />\neyes, causing my poor head to ache so.<br />\nBut I am not crazy, I tell you. I swear it.<br />\nListen\u2014does a madman think?<br />\nDoes a<br />\nmaniac feel? Does a lunatic plan and plan<br />\nand plan? I plan, night and day I plan how<br />\nI can find a way to suck the keeper's blood.<br />\nAh! the nice feast of blood I once had, long,<br />\nso long ago. Sit still. I am calm and will<br />\ntell you quietly.<br />\nShe was my mother. Tall and fair, and<br />\nso kind and good. Oh, I loved her passionately, my sweet mother. I proved it. But<br />\nit was her veins, her large blue veins that<br />\nI hated. They crossed and recrossed her<br />\npretty hands. It was damnable that she<br />\nkept those veins there when I loved her so.<br />\nAnd they would fill at times, oh so much.<br />\nAnd stand out from her hands, and beat,<br />\nbeat, beat. But I rid myself of their presence<br />\nfinally\u2014ha! ha! But I had to plan, oh, so<br />\nlong, before I found the means, and then I<br />\nwent to work. I knew she had too much<br />\nblood, and I determined to suck her veins<br />\nempty\u2014ha! ha!\u2014then I would lose that<br />\nhaunting terror. But listen! There were<br />\nalways people, other people with her, and I<br /><br />\nB<br /><br />\ndid not want to share her blood with anyone<br />\nelse. It should be mine, all mine, for was<br />\nnot the idea mine? Even at night I was<br />\nthwarted, for my father was in the same<br />\nroom, and he was a poor sleeper, and delicate. He did not have much blood. I<br />\nlaughed when I thought how much he would<br />\nlike to share my mother's blood with me.<br />\nMy room adjoined theirs, and every night<br />\nfor a fortnight after I had made my plans,<br />\nI would creep, easily, softly, to the door of<br />\ntheir room and listen. I would wrap thick<br />\nsheets about my chest, for my heart beat<br />\nloudly, and I was afraid she would hear.<br />\nMy father did hear the thump, thump of my<br />\nheart for every night just as I would put<br />\nmy foot on the door-sill he would stir. Then<br />\nI would have to go back, slowly, softly to<br />\nmy bed and hush the beating of my heart in<br />\nthe bed-coverings. As the fortnight waned,<br />\nI grew more and more anxious to carry out<br />\nmy plan, and it was almost with difficulty<br />\nthat I composed myself when I went to get<br />\nthe regular morning kiss from my mother.<br />\nBut luck came at last on the fourteenth<br />\nnight. My father had been ill, and they had<br />\ngiven him a sleeping potion. How I chuckled<br />\nwhen the doctor left the house! How joyously I went to kiss my mother before going<br />\nto my room that night. Her warm breath<br />\nlulled me as I bent over to kiss her. But as<br />\nI did so she raised her hands and I saw the<br />\nveins. How they mocked me! Fury filled<br />\nmy breast and tore my soul. My own blood<br />\nrushed to my head, and as at night, my heart<br />\nbegan, thump\u2014thump\u2014thump. I knew the<br />\nbeating would be heard by her, and I hurried<br />\nfrom the room. She did not know, she did<br />\nnot suspect\u2014ha! ha! I am too clever for<br />\nthat. I hid my emotions, oh! so well.<br />\nHurriedly I tore off my clothes, put out my<br />\nlight, and got into bed. A cricket was chirping outside, and I was glad, for that would<br />\nhelp to deaden the noise of my heart. . .<br />\nI listened! I heard my mother ascend the<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nstairs, and enter her room. I bit my tongue<br />\nto keep from screaming with delight. And<br />\nstill the cricket chirped louder and louder.<br />\nLong, ohl so long afterwards, the creaking<br />\nsound told me that my mother had gotten<br />\ninto bed, and then the slow minutes began<br />\nto creep by. The cricket must have made<br />\nover a thousand chirps before I finally concluded that my mother had gone to sleep\u2014I<br />\nwas so patient. Then quietly, real quietly,<br />\nI slipped out of bed. To-night I wrapped<br />\nthe blanket, instead of a sheet over my nightclothes, and the beating of my heart was not<br />\nso loud. Then, you see, the cricket\u2014the<br />\ngood cricket\u2014kept on chirping louder and<br />\nlouder.<br />\nI had opened my mother's door, and stood<br />\nin her room. I stopped a moment to assure<br />\nmyself that her breath was regular. The<br />\nmoon had slipped behind a cloud and there<br />\nwas only light enough coming through the<br />\nwindow to distinguish the dim outlines of<br />\nmy sleeping parents. My mother was nearer<br />\nthe window, and as the moon came out from<br />\nunder the cloud, I saw that she was smiling<br /><br />\n(To the tune of<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nin her sleep. Oh! such a sweet smile, and<br />\nhow I loved her!<br />\nMy foot must have shifted to a loose board<br />\nin the flooring for she stirred and slowly<br />\nAt first she<br />\nopened her beautiful eyes.<br />\nstared in a half conscious way at the ceiling,<br />\nbut as consciousness returned, her eyes<br />\ngradually shifted to the door where I was<br />\nstanding. For a moment she seemed transfixed, and then slowly terror crept into her<br />\neyes, as she gazed at the white outlines of<br />\nmy figure. I chuckled softly at heart, for<br />\nI knew now that the same fascination held<br />\nher, that always made my eyes seek her veincovered hands. Ah, those veins\u2014those full<br />\nveins! The moonlight was creeping down<br />\nthe length of her body, and just then fell<br />\nupon her clenched hands. The hideous veins<br />\n\u2014how they stuck out! I grew furious\u2014they<br />\nmocked me.<br />\nWith one piercing scream I sprung at her,<br />\nand bore her to the floor. Ha! ha! she was<br />\nso weak, my sweet mother. What could she<br />\ndo when I plunged my teeth into her warm<br />\nhands?

With last year's reputation to sustain, the men put forth their best efforts and<br />\nthe result was that the Black and Blue team<br />\nwon the meet easily with 23 points to their<br />\ncredit. The relay team won the match race<br />\nwith George Washington in handy style and<br />\nmade the fastest time of the evening.<br />\nIn the races the Hopkins runners were<br />\ngreatly handicapped by the slippery condition of the track and the construction of<br />\nthe banks, which were arranged differently<br />\nthan they had been before.<br />\nThe first event of the night went to Hopkins. Branham and Lynch qualified in the<br />\n50 yard novice, and in the final heat Lynch<br />\nwon by a good margin in the fast time of<br />\n514 seconds.<br />\nThe half mile scratch went to Hopkins<br />\nthrough default of other runners. Lynch,<br />\nMeyers and Brenton trotted around the track<br />\nat their leisure, and in the final spurt Brenton won, followed by Lynch and Meyers.<br />\nKnight kept up the good work by winning<br />\nthe 50 yard hurdles in easy style.<br />\nIn the mile run, which was won by Sheppard in 4 min., 23 sec., Breyer, J. H. U., and<br />\nBrenton, J. H. U., won second and third<br />\nplaces respectively.<br />\nThe relay race was the next to last thing<br />\non the program, and proved to be a walkover. Each runner gained from 8 to 10<br />\nyards in his turn, and Hunter finished about<br /><br />\n40 yards ahead of Lorando, last man on the<br />\nGeorge Washington team.<br />\nThe time, 2.35, was the fastest of the evening, and considering the condition of the<br />\ntrack and the fact that the runners were not<br />\nallowed to use spiked shoes, it compares favorably with any time ever mad eat Georgetown by a Hopkins team.<br />\n'The relay team consisted of Perce, '07,<br />\nStewart, '07, Padgett, '07, and Hunter, '07<br />\n(capt.).<br /><br />\nBASEBALL.<br />\nWith its first game less than ten days off,<br />\nthe baseball team is fast rounding into shape.<br />\nRegular practices have been held in the cage<br />\non Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays,<br />\nand while all the practices have not been<br />\nfully attended, yet they have proved most<br />\nuseful in getting a line on the capabilities of<br />\nthe candidates. The first outdoor practice<br />\nwill probably be held on Thursday, and from<br />\nthen on Oriole Park will be substituted for<br />\nthe cage.<br />\nOf the new men out for the team, Webb<br />\nand Watkins seem the most promising.<br />\nWebb has been catching in great style, and<br />\nwill undoubtedly be seen behind the bat.<br />\nThe finger which he broke in practice several weeks ago, is almost well again, and<br />\nprobably will be entirely so by the time of<br />\nthe Dickinson game. One of the weak spots<br />\nin last year's nine was the position of catcher,<br />\nbut this year it promises to be one of the<br />\nstrongest positions on the team.<br />\nWatkins looks like a \"find\" in the twirling line, and has both speed and curves.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nHowever, his control is somewhat of an unknown quantity, and it will largely depend<br />\non this whether he will be the mainstay in<br />\nthe box. Campbell, fortunately, can be relied upon to pitch steady, consistent ball, and<br />\nthen Waring, who made such a good showing last year under adverse circumstances,<br />\nis decidedly in the running. At the present<br />\nmoment, the Black and Blue battery is not<br />\ncausing the coaches any worry, and promises<br />\nto be far superior to that possessed by any<br />\nHopkins ball team for many years past.<br />\nThe infield is not so easy to pick. Bowie<br />\nis a good man at third, but is sometimes erratic, and it seems probable that Campbell<br />\nwill hold down that bag, when he is not<br />\npitching. At second, Budd and Iglehart<br />\nseem to be the most promising candidates,<br />\nwhile short and first base are positions about<br />\nwhich it would be impossible to make any<br />\ncertain decisions. Lyon can undoubtedly<br />\nhave centre field if he wants it, but at present he is trying for short. There are<br />\nenough candidates for the other two field<br />\npositions to justify the belief that they will<br />\nbe well and thoroughly looked after.<br />\nAltogether the prospects for a good team<br />\nare very bright. The only question is<br />\nwhether all the men who are trying for the<br />\nteam will come out regularly to practice and<br />\nwork conscientiously. There is no reason<br />\nwhy this should not be the case, and, as a<br />\nmatter of fact, this year the management is<br />\ngoing to pick consistent, rather than brilliant<br />\nplayers. In fact, this is the only way in<br />\nwhich the team can ever be welded together<br />\nas a unit, and unless the team is a unit, it<br />\ncan never hope to cope successfully with its<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nTHE JUNIOR BANQUET.<br /><br />\nThe Junior Banquet, which was held last<br />\nFriday was a thorough success. The Eutaw<br />\nHouse did itself proud, and as the company<br />\ndid not sit down until half-past nine, they<br />\nwere ready to do the menu ample justice.<br />\nThe one gloomy event of the evening was the<br />\nsudden illness of one of the banqueters,<br />\nbrought on by the heat and smoke. Copious<br />\nadministration of cold water over his bare<br />\nbody had to be resorted to before he returned to his senses. The decorations were<br />\nvery attractive, and the bacchanal wreaths<br />\nworn by some lent charm and color to the<br />\nscene.<br />\nAfter the \"garbage had been mangled\"<br />\n(apologies to Kipling), various toasts were<br />\nresponded to.
