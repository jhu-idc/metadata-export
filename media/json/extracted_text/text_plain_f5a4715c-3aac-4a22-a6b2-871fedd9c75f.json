There the opportunity is ripe for work of all kinds, and<br />\noffers the best field I know of at present.\"<br />\nMexico has been called \"the Egypt of the New World,\" and travelers can<br />\nindeed see a decided similarity between this earliest seat of American civilization<br />\nand that other cradle of the world's culture along the valley of the Nile. The<br />\nsame dry, healthy climate attracts visitors to both lands, the same diversity of<br />\narid desert and tropical vegetation is to be found, and the ancient temples and<br />\npyramids of the Pharaohs find their counterpart only a little less in antiquity and<br />\nsize in this historic part of the New World. In fact, the remains of the Aztec<br />\nand earlier civilizations in Mexico show such a decided similarity to the characteristics of the early Egyptians, that students have been led to consider seriously<br />\nthe question of the Semitic origin of the American races, and a late writer has<br />\neyen advanced the theory of America as the source of Asiatic culture.<br />\nMost people in the more northern section of the United States have erroneons ideas .of Mexico, both as a country and as a people. The country they<br />\nregard as a land of base prairie and primitive conditions, and the people as an<br />\ntintutored race of aborigines. Both ideas are far from fact. The land is ex1 remelv diversified, ranging from the luxurious . foliage of the tropics to mountains of splendid timber and fine ranch land, with considerable areas of sagebrush plain, yet less dreary in aspect probably, than the miles and miles of barren<br />\ndeserts in Arizona and other districts of the Southland. Crops grow fast in<br />\nMexico,. often three or more in a year; the climate is advantageous for cattle<br />\nand sheep raising, and the country needs only care to make it flow with milk<br />\nand honey.<br />\nThose who say there are no antiquities in America, have only to visit Mexico<br />\nto find themselves in the midst of as ancient scenes and thrilling spots of romance<br />\nas are to be found in any part of modern Europe. In the capital of Montezuma<br />\nwas found by Cones and his men, says a writer, \"a civilization superior to that<br />\nwhich they had left behind them in Spain,\" with a 'finely organized government,<br />\na splendid fighting force, and flourishing in all the arts which accompany a refined and cultivated people. The only blot which historians find upon the .Aztec<br />\npeople, was the barbarous regime of the priesthood, and yet this, considering all<br />\nthings, was no ,worse than the horrors of the Holy Inquisition, then in the height<br />\nof its unholy practices in Spain. And before the Aztec Empire exerted its sway<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fT1 11<br />\n<br />\nNEWS 1,1 11\"1'1,',1:.<br />\n<br />\nover all the valley of Mexico, other peoples sprang into power, lived their brief<br />\nlives, and passed away, unnoticed by history, leaving behind them only the<br />\nfanatic carvings and solid walls of masonry that attest the art that once flourished<br />\non this continent, while Europe was steeped in darkness and our Saxon ancestor<br />\nforests.<br />\nwere living in caves and devouring raw flesh in the depths of the German<br />\nthan<br />\nrather<br />\npreserves<br />\nEgypt,<br />\nof<br />\nNothing ever decays in Mexico; the air, like that<br />\nof a<br />\nlife<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\nmoment<br />\ndisintegrates, and a hundred years are but as a passing<br />\nCortes<br />\nby<br />\nfounded<br />\nwas<br />\nmonument or a building. In this city of Durango, which<br />\nas a frontier post against the unconquered natives of the North-west, whole rows<br />\nof dwellings, erected at that time, are still occupied. and the city theatre has been<br />\n;n active use for three hundred years. Compared with buildings in the United<br />\nStates, which spring up like mushrooms in a night, and in a few years are torn<br />\ndown to make place for others, the public edifices of Mexico date back to a<br />\nremote antiquity.<br />\nBut if Mexico can be compared in its physical characteristics to ancient<br />\nEgypt, there is possibly an equally strong likeness to that land which the Israelites<br />\nlooked to as promised to their father Abraham. Mexico is to present day Americans, a veritable land of promise, and throngs are crossing over daily to occupy<br />\nthe soil and to sit in the high places.<br />\nAmerican capital is pouring into Mexico at an enormous rate. Railroads<br />\nare being extended and improved, municipal lighting and power plants and water<br />\nworks are being constructed, improved mining and smelting methods are being<br />\nintroduced ; rubber, sugar and coffee plantations are being rapidly developed, and<br />\nall this is being largely done by Americans with American capital. It is estimated<br />\nthat the American capital invested in Mexico at present, amounts to about half a<br />\nbillion dollars. Presidelit Diaz, one of the greatest statesmen of this or any age,<br />\nhas extended a cordial welcome to American capitalists, engineers and merchants,<br />\nand has offered them exceptional facilities for developing the opportunities<br />\nwhich they have secured. All nations are represented in the search for the gold<br />\nof which Mexico has been the mythical storehouse ever since the days of Spanish<br />\ndiscovery, and the City of Mexico is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the<br />\nMexico is in the transitional stage which the United States passed<br />\nworld.<br />\nthrough about twenty years ago, when electricity began to supplant horse-power<br />\nand steam, and with rapid transit came improved methods in all kinds of manufacturing and distributing machinery. \u2022 The steel skeleton building is taking its<br />\nplace beside the century-old adobe house ; the latest mining machinery is supplanting the crude appliances that have been used ever since the mines were first<br />\nopened by the Spaniards ; the electric car and the electric light are well established ; and all the railroad companies have men out surveying lines to new points,<br />\nwhich will thus be given at once a tremendous impetus to growth. The greater<br />\npart of all this activity is in the hands of Americans, who thus find opportunity to<br />\nreproduce in a new country the same movements that took place in the Opening<br />\nup of the Western lands shortly after the Civil War.<br />\nThere is no reason why the opening up of Mexico should not result in a<br />\nprosperity similar to that of the great Western States of the Union. There are<br />\n<br />\n\fTIIK NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nmany inqucements for settlers, not the least of them being a generous and equable<br />\nclimate, where the snows of winter and the terrific heat of mid-summer are equally<br />\nunknown. The only draw-back to the greatest prosperity is the unstableness of<br />\nthe currency, but this question is at this 'very time being considered by a monetary<br />\ncommission, called for that very purpose. One of the greatest booms is expected<br />\nin Mexican real estate, which, it is prophesied, will be worth in gold in a few years<br />\nwhat it now brings in depreciated silver.<br />\nThe outlook for American engineers, physicians, dentists, chemists, machinists, and trained men of any kind, seems bright. Americans are very cordially<br />\nreceived by the Mexican people. In some cases the Americans are, however, no<br />\nmore able to penetrate the rigidity 'of the social usages in Mexico than are other<br />\nforeigners, but wherever the strictness of Spanish convention is relaxed, the<br />\nAmericans stand as the most favored people. In many places the American<br />\nresidents who are educated and refined, are received freely in the homes of the<br />\nwealthiest Mexican families, and invited to the balls and exclusive entertainments<br />\nof the fashionable Mexican set. In some instances American young men are<br />\ngiven liberty to call upon Mexican ladies at their homes.<br />\nThis privilege,<br />\nlargely denied by Mexican convention to even the beaux of their own race, who<br />\nare forced,to conduct a courtship at long range, shows how great is the friendship of our neighbors south of the Rio Grande.<br />\nNORM AN BOYER, '01<br />\nDurango, Mexico.<br />\nDR. SIDNEY LEE ON ELIZABETHAN LITERATURE.<br />\nN Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of last week, Sidney Lee, Litt.<br />\nD., of London. England, delivered a series of extremely interesting lectures<br />\non the general subject,\"Foreign Influences on Elizabethan Literature.\"<br />\nThe lectures were given on the Caroline Donovan foundation, and were largely attended by both University men and the general public, and Dr. Lee spoke in a manner so attractive as to instruct and entertain all.<br />\nDr. Lee is widely known as the editor of the \"Dictionary of National Biography,\" and is the author of a \"Life of William Shakespeare,\" which has supplanted all other works on the same subject, and a life of Queen Victoria, the<br />\nlatter recently published. He came to Baltimore after delivering a series of lectures on \"Famous Men of the Elizabethan Age,\" in Boston and Philadelphia.<br />\nWhile here he was the guest of Dr. Osler.<br />\n\"The Comparative Study of Elizabethan Literature,\" was the subject of Dr.<br />\nLee's first lecture. With a few appropriate remarks President Remsen introduced the lecturer, who spoke for an hour in the voice of a man who is intensely<br />\ninterested and well-grounded in his subject. He developed the idea that whereever we may turn in the great poets of the Elizabethan Era, we shall always find<br />\nin their works the influences of some foreign masterpieces. \"The Elizabethan<br />\nliterature,\" said Dr. Lee, \"is part of the European intellectual movement, we call<br />\nthe Renaissance. Everywhere the Western literature developed from that of<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\nGreece and Rome ; hence, to properly appreciate Elizabethan literature, we must<br />\nhave some knowledge of Greek and Latin poetry.\"<br />\nDr. Lee spoke on \"Italian Influence\" in his second lecture. According to<br />\nhim, although the works of Dante were little known in England, it was to the<br />\nItalian writers, both great and small, that the Elizabethans made resort. In<br />\nspeaking of the pastoral drama, Dr. Lee said: \"The pastoral drama owed its form,<br />\nits ideas, and, in fact, everything to contemporary Italian drama. The influence<br />\nof Dante was not great, nor was that of Petrarch so pronounced on the subsequent literature of Western Europe, as was that of 'Boccaccio. We can estimate<br />\nto some extent the influence of .Boccaccio on modern Western Europe, when we<br />\nremember that he is the ancestor of the modern novel.\"<br />\nThe third topic was \"French Influence.\" Dr. Lee said the French literature<br />\nhad exerted a greater influence upon English literature than that of any other nation. He showed how Italian poetry had influenced the French poets, and, how<br />\nthese in turn, had passed this influence on to the English. \"The influence of<br />\nFrench poetry on Elizabethan literature was probably most conspicuous in the<br />\nvast sonnet literature which was produced in Elizabethan England towards the<br />\nend of the sixteenth century.\" Dr. Lee also spoke at some length on the influence of French prose upon English prose, especially the writings of Montaigne.<br />\n\"His works were translated into English,\" said Dr. Lee, \"and they became exceptionally popular. Shakespeare put a whole passage from Montaigne in his<br />\n'Tempest.'\"<br />\nThe concluding lecture was upon \"Foreign Influence upon Shakespeare.\"<br />\nDr. Lee said that the Latin poetry was especially well-known to Shakespeare, and<br />\nthat it had a great influence upon his poetry. Ovid was a great favorite. Whataid the poet obtained from Greek poetry was derived from English translations. \"Despite this foreign influence.\" Dr. Lee declared, \"the literature of that<br />\nday was a national one.\"<br />\nALUMNI NOTES<br />\n<br />\n89<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nMr. Scott Thmnas, beginning July 1st, will hold the position of Assistant<br />\n<br />\nProfessor of Education and ( State) Examiner of High Schools, University of<br />\nCalifornia.<br />\nF.

To the majority of the<br />\nundergraduates Mr. Boyer is no stranger, and all will be pleased to learn<br />\nof his success in Mexico. His glowing account of that country will no doubt<br />\narouse the interest of the men who are about to leave the university and know not<br />\nwhither to turn their steps. To them Mr. Boyers article should appeal with more<br />\nthan passing- interest. It it true that a. man of ability can make opportunities, no<br />\nmatter where he may be, but it is also true that in a locality where the period of<br />\nrapid growth has already passed, opportunities are not to be found as readily as<br />\nin a new country. Mexico is just such a new country. It has the internal resources, and now it needs men, men with ideas, to develop those resources. To<br />\nbe sure, an American is hampered at the start by not knowing the language, but<br />\nsoon this can be overcome by being thrown in contact with the natives. Such a<br />\ndraw-back should not deter anyone from going to Mexico who feels that the future<br />\nof the country is really as bright as it has been painted. The adoption of a stable<br />\ncurrency will strengthen :\\ I exico's relations with other nations, and the present<br />\nactivity is only the dawn of that new era.<br />\n<br />\nl't<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\nN LESS something is done to relieve the present stringency of the editorial<br />\npocket-book, the News 14KVITY intends to seek out some beneficent philanthropist, and urge him to provide a fund upon which impecunious young<br />\nI en may draw when the photographer presents his bill. The mania for taking photographs is expensive, and we regret to say that it seems to be upon the increase.<br />\nThis burden falls with more than usual weight upon the members of the Senior<br />\nClass. Not an organization, team, board, or committee but feels that its duty has<br />\nnot been faithfully performed unless a group picture has been taken. The picture seems to give to the board an air of authority and a seal of legality which<br />\notherwise might 1...)e lacking. We deny that there is any desire upon the part of<br />\nthe young men to hand down the group picture to posterity, in order that future<br />\nages may know what giants there were in the good old days when Hopkins consisted of several buildings in the heart of the city, and a future which was nothing<br />\nbut promising. No, indeed. However, the group picture has a duty to perform<br />\naside from filling the coffers of heartless, grasping, inordinate photographers. It<br />\nserves as a constant reminder that, in some respects, the life of our uncivilized<br />\nancestors was not without its compensations. No doubt Adam and Ev,-; chortled<br />\nwith glee when they ascertained that there were no camera fiends in the vicinity,<br />\nrepresenting the Garden of Eden year book for the year Naughty-naught, eager<br />\nto take a group picture of the first lady president of the Dress Reform League,<br />\nand her other and better half. When our ancestors exchanged their bear-skin<br />\nclothing and their cave dwelling for the spike-tailed coat and the modern apartment house they really made a change for the better. But if they got the best of<br />\nthe bargain when they made an, exchange for the group picture, we shudder to<br />\nthink what they gave up when they made the trade.<br />\n<br />\n(11<br />\n<br />\nHE Hopkins athletic games to be held at the Fifth regiment Armory on the<br />\n28th of this month, bid fair to be the most important ever held in this cit v.<br />\nBefore everything else they have been arranged with a view of giving the<br />\nspectators an interesting evening's entertainment. Georgetown will be represented<br />\nby Duffy, Holland, and other. crack runners. Pennsylvania will send men. The<br />\nrelay races will be important features. So far all the efforts which have been<br />\nmade to make the meet an example of what good, successful athletes really are<br />\nhave met with unqualified success. The regimental committee having the Armory<br />\nbuilding in charge, have offered courteously to allow short spikes to be used on<br />\nthis one occasion. This is . a highly complimentary concession, and one which<br />\nis thoroughly appreciated by Hopkins men. II makes possible the presence of<br />\nseveral famous runners who otherwise would not compete.<br />\nAccording to the entry blanks, the handicaps have been restricted to reasonable distances by the games committee, thus insuring to the scratch man a<br />\nchance of making his presence felt. Another feature will be the special scratch<br />\nevents. These are far more satisfactory than the usual handicap 'races, and will<br />\ngive an twortunity of judging of the real ability of the several contestants.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS 141,, TTE,R.<br />\n(V E desire to call the attention of the members of the Junior and Freshman<br />\nclasses to the vacancies on the Nms 1,01'104. 2\\t the present time the<br />\ntwo positions of assistant news-editors are open, and when the Seniors<br />\ncease their connection With the paper at Easter, there will be several more vacancies which must be filled.

In addition to the usual events scheduled, exhibitions are expected to be given by Arthur F. Dtiffy of Georgetown, who holds the<br />\nworld's record for 100 yards, of 9 :3-5 seconds, and by Ray C. Emory, who holds<br />\nthe world's record for the standing high jump. Special efforts will be made to<br />\nkeep the floor clear, and to have everything so arranged beforehand that there will<br />\nhe no unnecessary and tedious delays in running off the several events.

In every particular .<br />\nthese games were thoroughly satisfactory to all concerned, and too much<br />\ncannot be said to the credit of those who had them in charge, for the masterly manner in which they were run off. The list of entries was unusually large.<br />\nSuch institutions as Pennsylvania, Cornell, Columbia, Harvard', Princeton and<br />\nJohns Hopkins were represented, as well as other schools, athletic clubs and associations, thereby bringing together the fastest men in the business. Consequently<br />\nevery event was hotly contested, and a victory valued accordingly. The showing<br />\nmade by Baltimore men was very creditable. Hopkins, for her part, had her<br />\ngreatest success in the Relay Race with Villa Nova. Clarence Stone, in his first<br />\nappearance on the team, started the good work by a lead of 3 yards at the end<br />\nof his run. Captain Hoffman was passed by his opponent, but finally recovered<br />\nhis loss and finished with 12 yards to the good. Freese in his turn increased this<br />\n. distance, and England ended the race in great style. Besides this race, Freese<br />\nwon a close second in the 50 yard hurdle. Pessagno also showed up well in the<br />\n50 yard dash, finishing second in the semi-finals. The absence of Helmholtz and<br />\nTootle in the dashes was deeply felt. All of our men who went over to see the<br />\ngames felt fully repaid for their trouble, and have no unfavorable criticism to make.<br />\n<br />\nOUTDOOR LACROSSE.<br />\nOn last Saturday afternoon the lacrosse squad practiced at Druid Hill Park<br />\nfor the first time this season, and since then they have been able to get in several<br />\ndays of good work out of doors. The men showed the need of out-door exercise,<br />\nas they were pretty well done up by the unwonted exertion.<br />\nThe playing was fast, and for that reason could not be kept up for any considerable time. The absence of some of the older men, who could not find it convenient to go out at this stage of the game, was seriously felt. It is expected that in a<br />\nfew (lays all of them will be out, including the men from the medical school.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n13<br />\n<br />\nManager Addison has received a letter from the management of the Universit v of Thronto team accepting the sixth of June as the date of the game between<br />\nthe two teams in this city.

There the opportunity is ripe for work of all kinds, and<br />\noffers the best field I know of at present.\"<br />\nMexico has been called \"the Egypt of the New World,\" and travelers can<br />\nindeed see a decided similarity between this earliest seat of American civilization<br />\nand that other cradle of the world's culture along the valley of the Nile. The<br />\nsame dry, healthy climate attracts visitors to both lands, the same diversity of<br />\narid desert and tropical vegetation is to be found, and the ancient temples and<br />\npyramids of the Pharaohs find their counterpart only a little less in antiquity and<br />\nsize in this historic part of the New World. In fact, the remains of the Aztec<br />\nand earlier civilizations in Mexico show such a decided similarity to the characteristics of the early Egyptians, that students have been led to consider seriously<br />\nthe question of the Semitic origin of the American races, and a late writer has<br />\neyen advanced the theory of America as the source of Asiatic culture.<br />\nMost people in the more northern section of the United States have erroneons ideas .of Mexico, both as a country and as a people. The country they<br />\nregard as a land of base prairie and primitive conditions, and the people as an<br />\ntintutored race of aborigines. Both ideas are far from fact. The land is ex1 remelv diversified, ranging from the luxurious . foliage of the tropics to mountains of splendid timber and fine ranch land, with considerable areas of sagebrush plain, yet less dreary in aspect probably, than the miles and miles of barren<br />\ndeserts in Arizona and other districts of the Southland. Crops grow fast in<br />\nMexico,. often three or more in a year; the climate is advantageous for cattle<br />\nand sheep raising, and the country needs only care to make it flow with milk<br />\nand honey.<br />\nThose who say there are no antiquities in America, have only to visit Mexico<br />\nto find themselves in the midst of as ancient scenes and thrilling spots of romance<br />\nas are to be found in any part of modern Europe. In the capital of Montezuma<br />\nwas found by Cones and his men, says a writer, \"a civilization superior to that<br />\nwhich they had left behind them in Spain,\" with a 'finely organized government,<br />\na splendid fighting force, and flourishing in all the arts which accompany a refined and cultivated people. The only blot which historians find upon the .Aztec<br />\npeople, was the barbarous regime of the priesthood, and yet this, considering all<br />\nthings, was no ,worse than the horrors of the Holy Inquisition, then in the height<br />\nof its unholy practices in Spain. And before the Aztec Empire exerted its sway<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nT1 11<br /><br />\nNEWS 1,1 11\"1'1,',1:.<br /><br />\nover all the valley of Mexico, other peoples sprang into power, lived their brief<br />\nlives, and passed away, unnoticed by history, leaving behind them only the<br />\nfanatic carvings and solid walls of masonry that attest the art that once flourished<br />\non this continent, while Europe was steeped in darkness and our Saxon ancestor<br />\nforests.<br />\nwere living in caves and devouring raw flesh in the depths of the German<br />\nthan<br />\nrather<br />\npreserves<br />\nEgypt,<br />\nof<br />\nNothing ever decays in Mexico; the air, like that<br />\nof a<br />\nlife<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\nmoment<br />\ndisintegrates, and a hundred years are but as a passing<br />\nCortes<br />\nby<br />\nfounded<br />\nwas<br />\nmonument or a building. In this city of Durango, which<br />\nas a frontier post against the unconquered natives of the North-west, whole rows<br />\nof dwellings, erected at that time, are still occupied. and the city theatre has been<br />\n;n active use for three hundred years. Compared with buildings in the United<br />\nStates, which spring up like mushrooms in a night, and in a few years are torn<br />\ndown to make place for others, the public edifices of Mexico date back to a<br />\nremote antiquity.<br />\nBut if Mexico can be compared in its physical characteristics to ancient<br />\nEgypt, there is possibly an equally strong likeness to that land which the Israelites<br />\nlooked to as promised to their father Abraham. Mexico is to present day Americans, a veritable land of promise, and throngs are crossing over daily to occupy<br />\nthe soil and to sit in the high places.<br />\nAmerican capital is pouring into Mexico at an enormous rate. Railroads<br />\nare being extended and improved, municipal lighting and power plants and water<br />\nworks are being constructed, improved mining and smelting methods are being<br />\nintroduced ; rubber, sugar and coffee plantations are being rapidly developed, and<br />\nall this is being largely done by Americans with American capital. It is estimated<br />\nthat the American capital invested in Mexico at present, amounts to about half a<br />\nbillion dollars. Presidelit Diaz, one of the greatest statesmen of this or any age,<br />\nhas extended a cordial welcome to American capitalists, engineers and merchants,<br />\nand has offered them exceptional facilities for developing the opportunities<br />\nwhich they have secured. All nations are represented in the search for the gold<br />\nof which Mexico has been the mythical storehouse ever since the days of Spanish<br />\ndiscovery, and the City of Mexico is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the<br />\nMexico is in the transitional stage which the United States passed<br />\nworld.<br />\nthrough about twenty years ago, when electricity began to supplant horse-power<br />\nand steam, and with rapid transit came improved methods in all kinds of manufacturing and distributing machinery. \u2022 The steel skeleton building is taking its<br />\nplace beside the century-old adobe house ; the latest mining machinery is supplanting the crude appliances that have been used ever since the mines were first<br />\nopened by the Spaniards ; the electric car and the electric light are well established ; and all the railroad companies have men out surveying lines to new points,<br />\nwhich will thus be given at once a tremendous impetus to growth. The greater<br />\npart of all this activity is in the hands of Americans, who thus find opportunity to<br />\nreproduce in a new country the same movements that took place in the Opening<br />\nup of the Western lands shortly after the Civil War.<br />\nThere is no reason why the opening up of Mexico should not result in a<br />\nprosperity similar to that of the great Western States of the Union. There are<br /><br />\nTIIK NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nmany inqucements for settlers, not the least of them being a generous and equable<br />\nclimate, where the snows of winter and the terrific heat of mid-summer are equally<br />\nunknown. The only draw-back to the greatest prosperity is the unstableness of<br />\nthe currency, but this question is at this 'very time being considered by a monetary<br />\ncommission, called for that very purpose. One of the greatest booms is expected<br />\nin Mexican real estate, which, it is prophesied, will be worth in gold in a few years<br />\nwhat it now brings in depreciated silver.<br />\nThe outlook for American engineers, physicians, dentists, chemists, machinists, and trained men of any kind, seems bright. Americans are very cordially<br />\nreceived by the Mexican people. In some cases the Americans are, however, no<br />\nmore able to penetrate the rigidity 'of the social usages in Mexico than are other<br />\nforeigners, but wherever the strictness of Spanish convention is relaxed, the<br />\nAmericans stand as the most favored people. In many places the American<br />\nresidents who are educated and refined, are received freely in the homes of the<br />\nwealthiest Mexican families, and invited to the balls and exclusive entertainments<br />\nof the fashionable Mexican set. In some instances American young men are<br />\ngiven liberty to call upon Mexican ladies at their homes.<br />\nThis privilege,<br />\nlargely denied by Mexican convention to even the beaux of their own race, who<br />\nare forced,to conduct a courtship at long range, shows how great is the friendship of our neighbors south of the Rio Grande.<br />\nNORM AN BOYER, '01<br />\nDurango, Mexico.<br />\nDR. SIDNEY LEE ON ELIZABETHAN LITERATURE.<br />\nN Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of last week, Sidney Lee, Litt.<br />\nD., of London. England, delivered a series of extremely interesting lectures<br />\non the general subject,\"Foreign Influences on Elizabethan Literature.\"<br />\nThe lectures were given on the Caroline Donovan foundation, and were largely attended by both University men and the general public, and Dr. Lee spoke in a manner so attractive as to instruct and entertain all.<br />\nDr. Lee is widely known as the editor of the \"Dictionary of National Biography,\" and is the author of a \"Life of William Shakespeare,\" which has supplanted all other works on the same subject, and a life of Queen Victoria, the<br />\nlatter recently published. He came to Baltimore after delivering a series of lectures on \"Famous Men of the Elizabethan Age,\" in Boston and Philadelphia.<br />\nWhile here he was the guest of Dr. Osler.<br />\n\"The Comparative Study of Elizabethan Literature,\" was the subject of Dr.<br />\nLee's first lecture. With a few appropriate remarks President Remsen introduced the lecturer, who spoke for an hour in the voice of a man who is intensely<br />\ninterested and well-grounded in his subject. He developed the idea that whereever we may turn in the great poets of the Elizabethan Era, we shall always find<br />\nin their works the influences of some foreign masterpieces. \"The Elizabethan<br />\nliterature,\" said Dr. Lee, \"is part of the European intellectual movement, we call<br />\nthe Renaissance. Everywhere the Western literature developed from that of<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\nGreece and Rome ; hence, to properly appreciate Elizabethan literature, we must<br />\nhave some knowledge of Greek and Latin poetry.\"<br />\nDr. Lee spoke on \"Italian Influence\" in his second lecture. According to<br />\nhim, although the works of Dante were little known in England, it was to the<br />\nItalian writers, both great and small, that the Elizabethans made resort. In<br />\nspeaking of the pastoral drama, Dr. Lee said: \"The pastoral drama owed its form,<br />\nits ideas, and, in fact, everything to contemporary Italian drama. The influence<br />\nof Dante was not great, nor was that of Petrarch so pronounced on the subsequent literature of Western Europe, as was that of 'Boccaccio. We can estimate<br />\nto some extent the influence of .Boccaccio on modern Western Europe, when we<br />\nremember that he is the ancestor of the modern novel.\"<br />\nThe third topic was \"French Influence.\" Dr. Lee said the French literature<br />\nhad exerted a greater influence upon English literature than that of any other nation. He showed how Italian poetry had influenced the French poets, and, how<br />\nthese in turn, had passed this influence on to the English. \"The influence of<br />\nFrench poetry on Elizabethan literature was probably most conspicuous in the<br />\nvast sonnet literature which was produced in Elizabethan England towards the<br />\nend of the sixteenth century.\" Dr. Lee also spoke at some length on the influence of French prose upon English prose, especially the writings of Montaigne.<br />\n\"His works were translated into English,\" said Dr. Lee, \"and they became exceptionally popular. Shakespeare put a whole passage from Montaigne in his<br />\n'Tempest.'\"<br />\nThe concluding lecture was upon \"Foreign Influence upon Shakespeare.\"<br />\nDr. Lee said that the Latin poetry was especially well-known to Shakespeare, and<br />\nthat it had a great influence upon his poetry. Ovid was a great favorite. Whataid the poet obtained from Greek poetry was derived from English translations. \"Despite this foreign influence.\" Dr. Lee declared, \"the literature of that<br />\nday was a national one.\"<br />\nALUMNI NOTES<br /><br />\n89<br />\n'<br /><br />\nMr. Scott Thmnas, beginning July 1st, will hold the position of Assistant<br /><br />\nProfessor of Education and ( State) Examiner of High Schools, University of<br />\nCalifornia.<br />\nF.

Mr. Rice is having splendid success in his work with railroad<br />\nmen. He will have something very interesting to tell us about an important department of Christian work, which is being greatly appreciated by all large railroad corporations.<br />\nThe State Convention, which was held in Baltimore March 1;th, 7th and .8th,<br />\nproved to he a success for the vkiting delegates. The home association did not<br />\nderive as much benefit as possible, because the members did not avail themselves<br />\nof the opportunities. Those of us who did attend derived much of pleasure and<br />\ninterest from it.<br />\nThe program was good, especially on Friday evening at Brown Memorial<br />\nChurch, when Mr. rI illar told of the wonderful advance in Army and Navy work<br />\nin the last five years.

St. John's sent twenty-seven men from Annapolis,<br />\nand Delaware College had ten.<br />\nThe luncheons on Friday and Saturday were also very interesting.

To the majority of the<br />\nundergraduates Mr. Boyer is no stranger, and all will be pleased to learn<br />\nof his success in Mexico. His glowing account of that country will no doubt<br />\narouse the interest of the men who are about to leave the university and know not<br />\nwhither to turn their steps. To them Mr. Boyers article should appeal with more<br />\nthan passing- interest. It it true that a. man of ability can make opportunities, no<br />\nmatter where he may be, but it is also true that in a locality where the period of<br />\nrapid growth has already passed, opportunities are not to be found as readily as<br />\nin a new country. Mexico is just such a new country. It has the internal resources, and now it needs men, men with ideas, to develop those resources. To<br />\nbe sure, an American is hampered at the start by not knowing the language, but<br />\nsoon this can be overcome by being thrown in contact with the natives. Such a<br />\ndraw-back should not deter anyone from going to Mexico who feels that the future<br />\nof the country is really as bright as it has been painted. The adoption of a stable<br />\ncurrency will strengthen :\\ I exico's relations with other nations, and the present<br />\nactivity is only the dawn of that new era.<br /><br />\nl't<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\nN LESS something is done to relieve the present stringency of the editorial<br />\npocket-book, the News 14KVITY intends to seek out some beneficent philanthropist, and urge him to provide a fund upon which impecunious young<br />\nI en may draw when the photographer presents his bill. The mania for taking photographs is expensive, and we regret to say that it seems to be upon the increase.<br />\nThis burden falls with more than usual weight upon the members of the Senior<br />\nClass. Not an organization, team, board, or committee but feels that its duty has<br />\nnot been faithfully performed unless a group picture has been taken. The picture seems to give to the board an air of authority and a seal of legality which<br />\notherwise might 1...)e lacking. We deny that there is any desire upon the part of<br />\nthe young men to hand down the group picture to posterity, in order that future<br />\nages may know what giants there were in the good old days when Hopkins consisted of several buildings in the heart of the city, and a future which was nothing<br />\nbut promising. No, indeed. However, the group picture has a duty to perform<br />\naside from filling the coffers of heartless, grasping, inordinate photographers. It<br />\nserves as a constant reminder that, in some respects, the life of our uncivilized<br />\nancestors was not without its compensations.

When our ancestors exchanged their bear-skin<br />\nclothing and their cave dwelling for the spike-tailed coat and the modern apartment house they really made a change for the better. But if they got the best of<br />\nthe bargain when they made an, exchange for the group picture, we shudder to<br />\nthink what they gave up when they made the trade.<br /><br />\n(11<br /><br />\nHE Hopkins athletic games to be held at the Fifth regiment Armory on the<br />\n28th of this month, bid fair to be the most important ever held in this cit v.<br />\nBefore everything else they have been arranged with a view of giving the<br />\nspectators an interesting evening's entertainment. Georgetown will be represented<br />\nby Duffy, Holland, and other. crack runners. Pennsylvania will send men. The<br />\nrelay races will be important features. So far all the efforts which have been<br />\nmade to make the meet an example of what good, successful athletes really are<br />\nhave met with unqualified success. The regimental committee having the Armory<br />\nbuilding in charge, have offered courteously to allow short spikes to be used on<br />\nthis one occasion. This is . a highly complimentary concession, and one which<br />\nis thoroughly appreciated by Hopkins men. II makes possible the presence of<br />\nseveral famous runners who otherwise would not compete.<br />\nAccording to the entry blanks, the handicaps have been restricted to reasonable distances by the games committee, thus insuring to the scratch man a<br />\nchance of making his presence felt. Another feature will be the special scratch<br />\nevents. These are far more satisfactory than the usual handicap 'races, and will<br />\ngive an twortunity of judging of the real ability of the several contestants.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS 141,, TTE,R.<br />\n(V E desire to call the attention of the members of the Junior and Freshman<br />\nclasses to the vacancies on the Nms 1,01'104. 2\\t the present time the<br />\ntwo positions of assistant news-editors are open, and when the Seniors<br />\ncease their connection With the paper at Easter, there will be several more vacancies which must be filled.

In every particular .<br />\nthese games were thoroughly satisfactory to all concerned, and too much<br />\ncannot be said to the credit of those who had them in charge, for the masterly manner in which they were run off. The list of entries was unusually large.<br />\nSuch institutions as Pennsylvania, Cornell, Columbia, Harvard', Princeton and<br />\nJohns Hopkins were represented, as well as other schools, athletic clubs and associations, thereby bringing together the fastest men in the business. Consequently<br />\nevery event was hotly contested, and a victory valued accordingly. The showing<br />\nmade by Baltimore men was very creditable. Hopkins, for her part, had her<br />\ngreatest success in the Relay Race with Villa Nova. Clarence Stone, in his first<br />\nappearance on the team, started the good work by a lead of 3 yards at the end<br />\nof his run. Captain Hoffman was passed by his opponent, but finally recovered<br />\nhis loss and finished with 12 yards to the good. Freese in his turn increased this<br />\n. distance, and England ended the race in great style. Besides this race, Freese<br />\nwon a close second in the 50 yard hurdle. Pessagno also showed up well in the<br />\n50 yard dash, finishing second in the semi-finals. The absence of Helmholtz and<br />\nTootle in the dashes was deeply felt.
