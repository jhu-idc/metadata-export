Because of this, it was necessary that the photographers<br />\nspend considerable time in taking individual photographs when they<br />\nreturned to the campus to take group pictures. All of the senior<br />\nstatistics have not been turned in as yet in spite of the fact that it is<br />\nessential to have these before starting on senior write-ups for the<br />\nbooks. If these are not turned in at once, it will be impossible to .put<br />\nthe Hullabaloo out on time. Yesterday slips were placed in post<br />\noffice boxes for election to the Hall of Fame. We hope that they will<br />\nbe turned in within a month.<br />\nOne would think that members of the class who do no work on<br />\nthe year-book themselves would at least have enough interest in their<br />\nannual to fill out statistics and to make appointments to be photographed. But, as we have said before, we have yet to find anything<br />\nin which any number of Hopkins men are vitally interested.<br />\n<br />\nTHIS MATTER OF INITIATIONS<br />\nTHE following editorial appeared recently in The Lafayette, undergraduate publication at Lafayette College.<br />\n\"Customarily, editors of collegiate literary organs launch tirades<br />\nagainst the initiation systems clung to by fraternities. It is refreshing to<br />\nnote that, at Lafayette, the prevalence of inane horseplay is diminishing in that respect. Fraternities are coming to realize that the humorous aspect of seeing cattle tethered about the campus is losing its<br />\nfreshness. They are beginning to see that the process of admitting<br />\na man to lifelong affiliation with an organization can be just as<br />\neffective without the clowning.<br />\n\"There is still room for improvement in that the realization has<br />\nnot yet come about that it is harmful scholastically both to the individual and the group to allow the period of the initiation of the<br />\nneophytes to drag over a period of a week or ten days. At this time<br />\nof the year the professors are taxed with the problem of poor attendance and poorer recitation. Mediocre work at the commencement of<br />\na term means a poor foundation in the subject and carries with it the<br />\ndifficulty of accomplishing highly efficient work later in the spring.<br />\nAt several colleges the process of pledging a man and admitting him<br />\ninto the bonds of brotherhood takes no more than three days. 'Undoubtedly this is more feasible where second term or second year<br />\nrushing is the rule. However, steps toward shortening initiations<br />\nmight well be taken without such conditions existing.

Because of this, it was necessary that the photographers<br />\nspend considerable time in taking individual photographs when they<br />\nreturned to the campus to take group pictures. All of the senior<br />\nstatistics have not been turned in as yet in spite of the fact that it is<br />\nessential to have these before starting on senior write-ups for the<br />\nbooks. If these are not turned in at once, it will be impossible to .put<br />\nthe Hullabaloo out on time. Yesterday slips were placed in post<br />\noffice boxes for election to the Hall of Fame. We hope that they will<br />\nbe turned in within a month.<br />\nOne would think that members of the class who do no work on<br />\nthe year-book themselves would at least have enough interest in their<br />\nannual to fill out statistics and to make appointments to be photographed. But, as we have said before, we have yet to find anything<br />\nin which any number of Hopkins men are vitally interested.<br /><br />\nTHIS MATTER OF INITIATIONS<br />\nTHE following editorial appeared recently in The Lafayette, undergraduate publication at Lafayette College.<br />\n\"Customarily, editors of collegiate literary organs launch tirades<br />\nagainst the initiation systems clung to by fraternities. It is refreshing to<br />\nnote that, at Lafayette, the prevalence of inane horseplay is diminishing in that respect. Fraternities are coming to realize that the humorous aspect of seeing cattle tethered about the campus is losing its<br />\nfreshness. They are beginning to see that the process of admitting<br />\na man to lifelong affiliation with an organization can be just as<br />\neffective without the clowning.<br />\n\"There is still room for improvement in that the realization has<br />\nnot yet come about that it is harmful scholastically both to the individual and the group to allow the period of the initiation of the<br />\nneophytes to drag over a period of a week or ten days. At this time<br />\nof the year the professors are taxed with the problem of poor attendance and poorer recitation. Mediocre work at the commencement of<br />\na term means a poor foundation in the subject and carries with it the<br />\ndifficulty of accomplishing highly efficient work later in the spring.<br />\nAt several colleges the process of pledging a man and admitting him<br />\ninto the bonds of brotherhood takes no more than three days. 'Undoubtedly this is more feasible where second term or second year<br />\nrushing is the rule. However, steps toward shortening initiations<br />\nmight well be taken without such conditions existing. Certainly such<br />\na change would not be viewed with alarm by the faculty\".<br />\nAlthough at the Hopkins we are not troubled with initiations<br />\nlasting over a period of a week, the above arguments may be advanced<br />\nfor the complete abolishment of informal initiations\u2014a move that we<br />\nfirmly favor and believe that will be accomplished in the near future.<br /><br />\nEcho of the Marking Survey<br />\nEditor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nDr. Cohen, at the time of the inDear Sir:<br />\nterview, admitted \"it is all right to<br />\nFrom the publication of the story translate the letters into numbers.\"<br />\non the marking system by THE He also made it clear that he uses,<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, Feb. 24, there has in his record books, numerical<br />\ngrown an aspect of the world-wide grades.
