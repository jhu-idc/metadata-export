That in those courses in which<br />\nseniors do not form a majority of the<br />\nstudents, it Is suggested that the<br />\ninstructors excuse seniors from the<br />\ncourses during the reading period.<br />\nThe program embodied in these five<br />\npoints has been put into practice in<br />\nseveral American universities, notably Harvard.<br />\nDr. Evans, chairman of the Social<br />\nScience group stated, \"That one or<br />\ntwo places where this plan has been<br />\ntried a few abuses naturally crept<br />\nin, but those few students who did<br />\nnot adhere to the attention of the<br />\nprogram, lived to regret it.
