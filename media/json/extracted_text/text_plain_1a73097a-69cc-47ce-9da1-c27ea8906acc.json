In order to alleviate the<br />\nsituation, the Office of Student<br />\nFinancial Services has instituted<br />\nchanges this year which, \"should<br />\nrelieve the tension of finding a job<br />\nfor freshmen,\" according to<br />\nMaria Dixon, College WorkStudy Coordinator.<br />\nWork-study is a federally funded program in which students<br />\nwork at part-time jobs around<br />\ncampus. It is one of the most<br />\ncommon programs offered by the<br />\nUniversity. There were several<br />\nproblems, according to Dixon.<br />\nFirst, many departments were<br />\nnot getting enough work-study<br />\nparticipants, if any. Dixon explained this by saying that many<br />\nstudents wanted the \"glamour\"<br />\njobs of lab research which left<br />\nmany office jobs open.<br />\nSecondly, the old method for<br />\nfinding work-study jobs around<br />\ncampus, primarily the annual Job<br />\nFair, was not effective enough.<br />\nlAs a result, the Office of Student<br />\n<br />\nFinancial Services has eliminated<br />\nthe Job Fair and put all of the<br />\nwork-study jobs on computer.<br />\nDixon said that now students<br />\nwho are looking for work-study<br />\njobs can go to Barton Hall, Room<br />\n120, and use a computer to see<br />\nthe complete listing of jobs<br />\navailable. She added that the new<br />\nsystem gives upperclassmen more<br />\nflexibility and independence in<br />\nchoosing where to work.<br />\nAnother change in the WorkStudy Program is directed<br />\nspecifically at freshmen. In years<br />\npast, freshmen joined upperclassmen in looking for jobs.<br />\nThis year, all freshmen who participate in work-study have been<br />\nassigned to a job. According to<br />\nDixon, this benefits both the<br />\nfreshmen and the work-study program. For the freshmen, it ensures that a job is waiting. For the<br />\ndepartments who have had difficulty attracting work-study<br />\nstudents, it ensures that they will<br />\nhave their job openings filled.<br />\n, Freshman reactions have been<br />\ngenerally positive. \"Originally I<br />\nhad no idea what to expect, so I<br />\nwas glad that I was assigned,\"<br />\n<br />\nFrench Department threatens exodus<br />\nby Chris DeRuiter<br />\nThe Departments of French<br />\nand Classics at Hopkins have<br />\nbeen affected by the Five-Year<br />\nPlan's budget cuts, faculty cuts,<br />\nand student increases in very different ways.

Stephen Muller, advocate of the corporate university, is resigning amid considerable controversy. His vacant post will open possibilities for major<br />\nphilosophical changes in the way the University is run,<br />\nparticularly the beleaguered School of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nWe propose that Arts and Sciences, in conjunction with<br />\nthe Whiting School of Engineering, seize this opportunity<br />\nto create a successor to the Human Climate Task Force\u2014<br />\ncalled, perhaps, Mission Arts and Sciences.<br />\nThe Mission would be to define the goals of Arts and<br />\nSciences in a philosophically coherent manner. The<br />\nHopkins liberal arts could unite on three levels to produce<br />\na working raison cretre as an academic institution: professional (i.e., research and teaching), graduate (teaching<br />\nand learning), and undergraduate (learning). The goal for<br />\neach of these subdivisions should be not merely to re-label<br />\nthe current state of affairs (as a unique example of The<br />\nHopkins Experience), but rather, to set a new philosophical<br />\nstandard upon which all departments can build.<br />\nThe initial question here should not be a fiscal one. The<br />\nMission should delineate a philosophical standard for the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University of the future, as Johns Hopkins<br />\nhimself did when he founded the University. Rather than<br />\nallow Arts and Sciences to further dissolve into the<br />\nhomogenized national model, this a chance to restore the<br />\nfaculty to their role as a source of administrative policy.<br />\nBut the faculty must instigate this change; if they are divided in their support, the rest of the University will be as<br />\nwell.<br />\nA way might be found to revive a unique, and now<br />\nlargely defunct Hopkins tradition: dynamic graduate and<br />\nundergraduate interaction in the classroom, taking into account conventional realities. To acknowledge the importance of undergraduate education at Hopkins (far greater<br />\nthan at the University's founding in 1876), a tutorial system<br />\non the British model\u2014with graduate students from<br />\ndisciplines as diverse as history and medicine\u2014could<br />\nreturn to the residence halls. Although such systems exist, to an extent, at several institutions, Hopkins' edge could<br />\nlie in its traditionally integrated classrooms.<br />\nAlthough such programs may eventually require more<br />\nmoney, in the short run, a galvanizing Mission will accomplish far more than dollars alone. The reenfranchisement of the Arts and Sciences faculty and<br />\nstudents can only produce a sum greater than its present<br />\n<br />\nby Christopher T. McColl<br />\n<br />\ntop of wages, these preliminary<br />\nfunds are subsidized heavily by<br />\nhigh school graduation presents.<br />\nAround the time that everyone<br />\nelse was getting their first jobs in<br />\nhigh school, I was going through<br />\nan extremely traumatic period<br />\ntrying to understand exactly what<br />\nGod was. I was dating a Southern<br />\nBaptist, what they call a \"footwashin\"'Baptist, by the name of<br />\nKelly Pomroy. She was a dancer<br />\nwith dirty blonde hair and ice<br />\nblue eyes and a lilt underneath her<br />\n\"o's\" that still made my knees<br />\nbuckle. I'll be the first to admit<br />\nthat my interest was physical. Initially.

So<br />\nI figured my ideas were as good<br />\nas hers, which were as good as<br />\nanybody else's. I started reading<br />\nthe works of other philosophers<br />\nto see what the big ideas were. I<br />\neven signed up for a course at a<br />\nlocal college to learn more names<br />\nto look into. It was here that I<br />\nlearned about pantheism and<br />\nBaruch Spinoza.<br />\nBaruch Spinoza once theorized that the Universe as we know<br />\nit is composed of smaller parts,<br />\nknown as monads. These monads<br />\ninclude everything from everyday<br />\nitems, such as videocassettes and<br />\nScrabble and coffee makers, to<br />\nlarger, more abstract items and<br />\nideas, such as politics, death, men<br />\n<br />\nand women. And all of these<br />\nmonads, when considered<br />\ntogether, are God. And for<br />\nSpinoza, the only real learning in<br />\nlife is learning about God.<br />\nI wanted to learn to write. That<br />\nwas what I wanted to go to college for, anyway. I figured if I<br />\ncould master writing, then write<br />\nabout God, according to this guy<br />\nSpinoza, I could write about<br />\neverything.<br />\nTo prepare myself financially<br />\nfor college I got a job at a local<br />\nbookstore, knowing that the cash<br />\nI received from my relatives for<br />\ngraduation wouldn't subsidize my<br />\nfunds much.<br />\nI found upon receipt of my first<br />\npaycheck that money bought<br />\nthings I wanted. Lots of themand not just books, either. As a<br />\nresult, whereas most of my fellow<br />\nclassmates at Hopkins arrived<br />\nwith a tidy little kitty of money,<br />\nI got here with $200. Though I<br />\ndid have one hell of a stereo. And<br />\na coffee maker. And Scrabble.<br />\nThe result? By the end of my<br />\nfreshman year, I came to the conclusion that not being able to<br />\nbalance my checkbook really<br />\nwasn't a problem, since all I did<br />\nwas deposit my paycheck then<br />\nwrite a check out for that amount<br />\nto one person or another.<br />\nThat's why I put in the application for the American Express<br />\ncard then.

I wasn't really sure what<br />\nthey meant by this, but I didn't<br />\nwant to seem an idiot, so I said,<br />\n\"Well, this way, I have to pay it<br />\nall at the end of the month, so it<br />\nwill help me keep my money<br />\nstraight, and it will keep me<br />\nresponsible.\"<br />\nBut others of my friends seemed frightened. \"Chris, didn't you<br />\nbounce two checks last year on<br />\nyour checking account?\" Well,<br />\nyeah. \"So what are you doing<br />\nSee PUNCHLINE, 5.<br />\n<br />\nparts and help to placate the destructive forces which have<br />\narrived with fiscal uncertainty.<br />\nThe essence of the Mission should be to redefine the<br />\nUniversity, to rediscover what it is that should set Hopkins<br />\napart from peer institutions.

For those of you new to Homewood, Hoppy Hour is one of the few campus social events around<br />\nwhich a wide cross section of the Hopkins community<br />\nrallies. Not only does this event bring a relaxing close to<br />\nthe busy work week, welcoming in the weekend, but provides a casual atmosphere for students, professors, and<br />\nadminsistration to mix outside of the usual formal<br />\nconstraints.<br />\nThis year, the HOP Social Committee has made a few<br />\nnew policies to help ensure that Hoppie Hour will continue. The biggest change consists of the hiring of Stiiu<br />\ndent Activities Office Event Managers to check IDs,'tun<br />\nthe taps, and generally keep an eye on things as the fun<br />\ngets under way. This new delegation of responsibility for<br />\ndrinking age enforcement promises to make the job of<br />\nevent organizers less stressful, and will almost certainly<br />\nresult in improved programming. Ten Hoppy Hours are<br />\nplanned for this semester, and with the addition of weekly live entertainment and wine coolers, the popularity of<br />\nthe event promises to increase apace. We are hopeful that<br />\nan even larger number of Hoppy Hours will be held in<br />\nthe spring, with permanent resolution of the Glass Pavilion<br />\nscheduling conflicts which plagued last year's event.<br />\nThe Social Committee, which has planned an October<br />\nFest for next month along with a Monday night Sports Extravaganza in the Rat (replete with 50\" television and<br />\nserious food), should be commended for its dedication to<br />\nmaking the Hopkins experience a little better for everyone.<br />\nAnyone who has had anything to do with programming<br />\nat Homewood knows how difficult it can be to get regular<br />\nprogramming off the ground, but the Social Committee<br />\nhas done this and shows no signs of resting upon its laurels.<br />\nSee you at the Glass Pay!<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nWillmann 1<br />\nTo the Editors<br />\nOn Monday, September 18,<br />\nJenifer Willmann, a housemaster<br />\nin Building B, was forced to<br />\nresign her position.

Clearly, Residential Life feels<br />\nthe situation must be quite grave<br />\nif it requires this drastic step.<br />\nNone of us know what happened, and we wonder why, if it was<br />\nso obvious, did none of us see<br />\nanything wrong.<br />\nNow they will have to find a<br />\nsubstitute for Jen, but they can<br />\nnever replace her. Many of us are<br />\nstill very disillusioned and confused by the whole situation.<br />\nDavid Ross<br />\nWillmann 2<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn Monday, September 18,<br />\nJenifer Willmann was asked by<br />\nthe office of Residential Life to<br />\nas<br />\nposition<br />\nher<br />\nresign<br />\nhousemaster of Building B. I met<br />\nwith both Andrea Perry and<br />\nSharon Reynolds that day and<br />\nwas told that Jen's resignation<br />\nwas made \"voluntarily\" after<br />\nseveral charges had been brought<br />\nagainst her. I question how<br />\n\"voluntary\" her decision was,<br />\nespecially since I had spoken with<br />\nher the night before and she<br />\nreassured me that she loved her<br />\nposition as Housemaster, and<br />\nwould not give it up unless forced. What Andrea told me was an<br />\noutright lie, as were several<br />\nthings I was told by Andrea and<br />\n<br />\nSharon.<br />\nI asked whether or not thet6<br />\nwas actual evidence that Jen had<br />\ndone something wrong. I was told<br />\nthat there were several instances<br />\nwhere Residential Life staff<br />\nmembers and other Housemasters<br />\nbreaking<br />\nobserved<br />\nJen<br />\nHousemaster rules. What they<br />\nshould have told me was that they<br />\nwere basing accusations on hearsay and that they didn't have any<br />\nsolid evidence to back it up.<br />\nI asked why Jennifer was asked to resign her position but was<br />\ngiven no definite answer. Andrea<br />\nvery skillfully talked her way<br />\naround my question, saying thal<br />\nthere were differences in Jen'i<br />\npersonality and lifestyle that<br />\nclashed with the expectations of<br />\nResidential Life. My point is that<br />\nyou can't ask someone to resign<br />\njust because you disagree with<br />\nher personality.<br />\nOn Monday night, the residents<br />\nof Building B were asked by the<br />\nstaff of Residential Life to meet<br />\nwith them to discuss what happened to Jen, and what would<br />\nhappen next. All of those who at<br />\ntended that meeting hoped to hear<br />\nwhy Jen was being taken from us.<br />\nAgain, we were disappointed.<br />\nWe spent over an hour talking<br />\nwith Andrea and her two<br />\nassistants, Sharon and Dorothy.<br />\nTo my knowledge, not one of Oa<br />\nquestions were answered.<br />\nIn a letter to our dorm on Monday afternoon, Residential Life<br />\ntold us, \"We know what an imdifference<br />\nportant<br />\nyour<br />\nHousemasters can make in your<br />\nfreshman year experience.\" 1<br />\nquestion whether they really do<br />\nor not. I can speak for the rest of<br />\nthe dorm when I say that we are<br />\nvery close to Jen. She is exactly<br />\nwhat she should be; a confidante,<br />\na friend, a disciplinarian, and someone we all can count on. Jen<br />\nwas taken from us because of<br />\nbaseless lies and rumors, and was<br />\nnot given a chance to defend<br />\nherself.

Sam has the summer<br />\nto decide if she will move to Lexington with her<br />\nmother, and go to college, or stay in little<br />\nHopewell with her Uncle Emmett(Bruce Willis),<br />\na Vietnam veteran suffering from post-traumatic<br />\nstress disorder.<br />\nSam is of the generation too young to remember<br />\nVietnam. Perhaps more important, she's an idiot.<br />\nHer high school diploma transforms her into a<br />\nwalking question mark\u2014about her boyfriend, her<br />\nfather, and her future. Sam's father died in the<br />\nwar when she was still in utero, and she has never<br />\n<br />\nRECORD<br />\n<br />\nknown much about him.(He married her mother<br />\nonly a month before he was sent to Vietnam.)<br />\nSam peppers Emmett with questions(\"What's<br />\na frag?\") and he usually answers noncommitally. He doesn't think Sam will understand his situation, and isn't really convinced that she cares to.<br />\nThis isn't surprising, because most of the time,<br />\nSam is a veritable tub of glee. Her father's death<br />\n(to take one example) seems only to bother her<br />\namong other things.<br />\nIn an early scene, Sam is sprawled on her bed,<br />\nwondering both what her father was like and how<br />\nshe might manage to buy a car\u2014so she can go to<br />\nthe mall. What director Jewison intends to be<br />\nrevelatory is only embarrassing. Later, Sam mounts<br />\na picture ot her father on her mirror and laments,<br />\n\"You missed Watergate, `E.T.,' the Bruce<br />\nSpringsteen concert!\" Somehow, one suspects that<br />\nshe missed them, too.<br />\nSam's ignorance about Vietnam is difficult to<br />\nbelieve.

What the titles don't convey .is how deeply the Pixies wade into their<br />\nmaterial, adding layer after layer of irony and<br />\ntight, confident playing.<br />\n\"Doolittle\" (4AD/Elektra; LP, CD, and<br />\ncassette), the band's recent album, is a record with<br />\na short attention span.

And<br />\nmore often than not, the new song sounds like it<br />\nfits\u2014a weird, catchy extension of the first tune.<br />\nCatchiness, after weirdness, neatly defines the<br />\nPixies' best element. Though \"Doolittle\" contains<br />\nsnatches of punk, hardcore, and heavy metal, it<br />\ncoughs up equal doses of 1950s pop, surf music,<br />\n\"spaghetti western\" guitar, and more.

The song \"Cracicity<br />\nJones,\" which clocks in at under a minute and<br />\na half, combines the nonstop furor of hardcore<br />\npunk with a mock-Spanish vocal. \"Here Comes<br />\nYour Man\" mates a 1950s pop sound with<br />\nominous, angst-ridden singing: so strange is Francis' delivery that the man in the title might be<br />\nreturning from prison, or a mental institution.<br />\nBut like the Doctor for whom it is named,<br />\n\"Doolittle\" speaks in a score of arcane languages;<br />\nwe can't understand all of them.

The first feature in the series, \"The 5,000<br />\nfingers of Dr. T.,\" is a 1953 film written and<br />\ndesigned by Dr. Seuss. It tells the story of a boy,<br />\na young piano student, who falls asleep one night<br />\nand dreams up the sinister Dr. T.<br />\nIn the dream, Dr. T. kidnaps young piano<br />\nstudents and takes them to his kingdom. There,<br />\nhe chains them to an enormous piano\u2014the<br />\nkeyboard is as wide as the kingdom\u2014and forces<br />\nthem to practice.

You're not alone. According to<br />\nDr. David Dinges, a psychologist<br />\nand sleep researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, most of us<br />\nought to take naps. Brain-wave<br />\nstudies have shown that humans<br />\nhave an inherent tendency to sleep<br />\nTWICE a day\"- once in the evening and one other time, usually in the<br />\nmid-to-late afternoon. In fact,<br />\nresearchers from Boston and West<br />\nGermany put volunteers in<br />\nunderground rooms for weeks at a<br />\ntime, isolated from all indications of<br />\ntime with instructions to sleep<br />\n\"whenever they wanted.' They<br />\nfound that most subjects slept in two<br />\nperiods\u2014a long session at night and<br />\na shorter period of one to two hours<br />\nin the afternoon.<br />\nEven if you get a normal amount<br />\nof sleep at night, you will still tend<br />\nto be less accurate, even sluggish<br />\ntowards the middle of the day, say<br />\nsleep researchers at Montreal<br />\nHospital. Although many people attribute this drowsiness to having<br />\n<br />\neaten a heavy lunch, Roger<br />\nBroughton, a neurology professor at<br />\nthe University of Ottawa, says that<br />\ntime of day is the key factor in determining a person's degree of<br />\nalertness.<br />\nSo when is the \"right\" time to<br />\nnap? The average person will be<br />\nready for a nap about twelve hours<br />\nafter their middle period of sleep.<br />\nFor example, if you normally sleep<br />\n<br />\nfrom 2 am to 8 am, your body is<br />\nmost highly primed for napping<br />\naround 5 pm. While surveys show<br />\nthat about 55 percent of all college<br />\nstudents do nap regularly, they may<br />\nnot be getting the full benefits of the<br />\nextra sleep because they probably<br />\nonly lie down when they absolutely<br />\ncan't stay awake. To prevent this<br />\nkind of debilitating fatigue, Martin<br />\nOrne of the University of Pennsylvania, suggests \"prophylactic<br />\nnapping\", napping before you<br />\nbecome exhausted, instead.<br />\n\"Cat flappers\" are worse off than<br />\nthose who don't nap at all. Experiments have revealed that a ten to<br />\nfifteen minute siesta is too short to<br />\nimprove performance significantly,<br />\nlargely due to the fact that only the<br />\nfirst stage of sleep is reached during<br />\n<br />\nthis period, and it is the deeper<br />\nstages which seem to enhance alertness. So if you want to improve your<br />\ngrades, take a half-hour nap before<br />\nstudying for, or taking, that big exam. Psychologist John M. Taub of<br />\nSt. Louis, along with other i\u2022esearchers, has found that people perform<br />\nmore quickly and accurately after<br />\ntaking a short nap than before. Not<br />\nonly that, but they are said to be<br />\nmore cheerful and have better recall.<br />\nIf it is so beneficial, why don't<br />\nmore people take the time to rest?<br />\n\"Our society looks down on naps,\"<br />\nsays Dr. Dinges. \"When time is<br />\nregarded as money, napping is viewed as wasteful and self-indulgent.\"<br />\nDr. Dinges' research suggests that<br />\nafternoon naps would increase productivity among all groups of people. On the practical side, however,<br />\nnapping could prove dangerous for<br />\nthose who must work with toxic<br />\nchemicals or heavy machinery immediately after awakening. \"Sleep<br />\ninertia,\" the intense grogginess and<br />\nconfusion that result when a person<br />\nis suddenly awakened, lasts a few<br />\nminutes. Experts advise that no one<br />\nshould engage in any complicated<br />\nactivity until sleep inertia wears off.<br />\n<br />\nJohn Misa<br />\n<br />\nIs this your problem too?

Ni;.:e's assertive<br />\nslogan implies th:it all we need to<br />\novercome procrastination and get<br />\ndown to the setious work of exercising is a pair of costly, new<br />\nsneakers. In fact, initiating a<br />\nfitness program takes a little more<br />\ntime (and u little less cash than the<br />\npeople a'. Nike would have you<br />\nbelieve).<br />\nTo begin a successful course of<br />\nexercise requires that, from the<br />\nstart, you must trade in the idea<br />\nthat physical soundness can come<br />\nin an instant (that it can be purchased in the form of a pill or as<br />\nathletic gear) for the idea that<br />\nfitness will come after a time of<br />\ndedicated workouts.<br />\nJoanne McGurney, Johns<br />\nHopkins Women's Athletic<br />\nTrainer, stresses that when beginning a fitness program you need<br />\nto think along two routes. First:<br />\n\"Find something that you enjoy<br />\n'doing. That is the way to maintain the program.\" Suggested<br />\nways of training ranged from running, swimming, and bicycling to<br />\nracquetball, walking, and weight<br />\nlifting.<br />\nMcGurney says,<br />\n\"Whatever you feel good about<br />\ndoing is what you're likely to<br />\nstick with.\" Second: \"Along<br />\nwith that, be realistic about how<br />\nthe exercise will affect your body.<br />\nIf you want to work off extra<br />\npounds, a ten-minute walk every<br />\nother day won't be of much help,<br />\nno matter how enjoyable.\" The<br />\nquick message is that you must<br />\ndecide what kind of improvement<br />\nyou are after, then find exercises<br />\nthat will allow you to achieve<br />\nyour goals and that you'll look<br />\nforward to doing.<br />\nOne good way to exercise is<br />\nthrough<br />\ncross-training.<br />\nMcGurney stresses that generally there is \"better success with<br />\nvaried activities.\" Choosing different programs to pursue (such<br />\nas the \"triathlete\" program:<br />\nalternating days of running and<br />\nbiking and swimming)decreases<br />\nthe chances of the workouts<br />\n<br />\nbecoming<br />\nboring<br />\nand<br />\nsimultaneously decreases the risk<br />\nof injury caused by working the<br />\nsame muscle group repeatedly.<br />\n\"Additionally, varying the exercises will help your overall toning,\" says McGurney.<br />\nEven with great plans of action,<br />\nmany people find they cannot<br />\nfollow through on a fitness program. Common reasons for abandoning an exercise program are<br />\ndisappointment with early results,<br />\ninjury, and the lack of time or effort to continue. Disappointment<br />\nwith results is usually because the<br />\nprogram is inadequate to achieve<br />\nthe desired goals. For example,<br />\nthe person who hopes to lose<br />\nweight by jogging every day but<br />\nguzzling beer at night will find his<br />\napproach to fitness hopeless.<br />\nFitness can not be reached on<br />\na single level. You must develop<br />\na frame of mind that encourages<br />\nthe seeking of health on all levels,<br />\nincluding nutritional and emotional health. McGurney says that<br />\none must have a reasonable frame<br />\nof mind: \"You have to look at it<br />\nas a change in lifestyle. You can't<br />\ninstitute a realistic program if you<br />\nhave many other things to worry<br />\nabout.\"<br />\nCases where people attempt to<br />\npursue serious fitness without<br />\naltering their lifestyle lead to what<br />\nMcGurney calls a \"cycle of<br />\nfatigue.\" When someone gets little sleep and eats poorly\u2014either<br />\ntoo much or too little\u2014then trying to keep up with a fitness program can become more problematic than helpful.<br />\nIn dietary terms, McGurney<br />\npoints out that \"not much has to<br />\nbe incorporated unless you are<br />\naiming to be an endurance<br />\nathlete.\" You should eat normally, trying to increase carbohydrates and decrease the intake of fat and sugar.(The possi<br />\nble exception being the case<br />\nwhere a person loses too much<br />\nblood sugar while exercising and<br />\nrisks fainting spells.) Looking at<br />\nfitness in a wholistic way can<br />\ndramatically improve the chances<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 of success.<br />\nInjury can be avoided by starting slowly and working up the<br />\npace or impact incrementally.<br />\nFiguring out a simple warm-up or<br />\nstretching program (by working<br />\non what is \"tight\") can also<br />\ndebilrease the chance of a pulled<br />\nmuscle. Most people will be sore<br />\nafter their first few workouts, and<br />\nthat is normal--it lets the person<br />\nknow that his/her muscles have<br />\nbeen brought to higher levels.<br />\nMcGurney warns the novice<br />\nathlete to use common sense and<br />\nnot mistake general soreness for<br />\nmore painful and serious injury.<br />\nA harder problem to deal with<br />\nis the lack of time to follow<br />\nthrough on a fitness program.<br />\nThere are, frankly, bad times to<br />\nstart a fitness program. In the<br />\nmidst of overwhelming academic<br />\npressure, a fitness program will<br />\nstruggle to find a spot on the list<br />\nof things to do today.<br />\nMcGurney's advice is to wait<br />\nuntil you are ready and able to<br />\nembark on serious exercise and<br />\nthen understand that there are<br />\ndays when you will not be able<br />\nto find the time to work out.<br />\nMissing an occasional day of exercise, while it might make you<br />\nfeel guilty, shouldn't lead to the<br />\ncollapse of your fitness routine.<br />\n\"Be flexible with yourself and go<br />\nwith your instincts. If you feel<br />\nyou have to miss a day or two,<br />\nthat's okay.\"<br />\nExercise, especially for the<br />\nuniversity student, can be an unparalleled tension release. Used<br />\nwisely, a fitness program can improve your mood, your sleeping<br />\nand eating habits, and perhaps<br />\neven your grades. Exercise can<br />\nbecome work, though. But, as<br />\nMcGurney states, the bottom line<br />\nis,\"You should be doing it for<br />\nfun.\" So that once you find a program that is both enjoyable and<br />\nphysically rewarding, you<br />\nshouldn't need a pair of sleek<br />\nshoes to motivate you to excel.<br />\n<br />\nShort<br />\nShots<br />\nBy Rachel McGuckian<br />\n<br />\nSwarthmore overwhelms the Hopkins defense.<br />\n<br />\nFootball falls, 38-6<br />\nFOOTBALL, from 11<br />\nwe cannot let ourselves get<br />\ndown.\"<br />\nCornerback and tri-captain Jeff<br />\nSheaffer commented on the letdown of the Hopkins defense:<br />\n\"The parts of our team that were<br />\nthought our strong points, had<br />\nsome major letdowns in Friday's<br />\ngame.

In order to alleviate the<br />\nsituation, the Office of Student<br />\nFinancial Services has instituted<br />\nchanges this year which, \"should<br />\nrelieve the tension of finding a job<br />\nfor freshmen,\" according to<br />\nMaria Dixon, College WorkStudy Coordinator.<br />\nWork-study is a federally funded program in which students<br />\nwork at part-time jobs around<br />\ncampus. It is one of the most<br />\ncommon programs offered by the<br />\nUniversity. There were several<br />\nproblems, according to Dixon.<br />\nFirst, many departments were<br />\nnot getting enough work-study<br />\nparticipants, if any. Dixon explained this by saying that many<br />\nstudents wanted the \"glamour\"<br />\njobs of lab research which left<br />\nmany office jobs open.<br />\nSecondly, the old method for<br />\nfinding work-study jobs around<br />\ncampus, primarily the annual Job<br />\nFair, was not effective enough.<br />\nlAs a result, the Office of Student<br /><br />\nFinancial Services has eliminated<br />\nthe Job Fair and put all of the<br />\nwork-study jobs on computer.<br />\nDixon said that now students<br />\nwho are looking for work-study<br />\njobs can go to Barton Hall, Room<br />\n120, and use a computer to see<br />\nthe complete listing of jobs<br />\navailable. She added that the new<br />\nsystem gives upperclassmen more<br />\nflexibility and independence in<br />\nchoosing where to work.<br />\nAnother change in the WorkStudy Program is directed<br />\nspecifically at freshmen. In years<br />\npast, freshmen joined upperclassmen in looking for jobs.<br />\nThis year, all freshmen who participate in work-study have been<br />\nassigned to a job. According to<br />\nDixon, this benefits both the<br />\nfreshmen and the work-study program. For the freshmen, it ensures that a job is waiting. For the<br />\ndepartments who have had difficulty attracting work-study<br />\nstudents, it ensures that they will<br />\nhave their job openings filled.<br />\n, Freshman reactions have been<br />\ngenerally positive. \"Originally I<br />\nhad no idea what to expect, so I<br />\nwas glad that I was assigned,\"<br /><br />\nFrench Department threatens exodus<br />\nby Chris DeRuiter<br />\nThe Departments of French<br />\nand Classics at Hopkins have<br />\nbeen affected by the Five-Year<br />\nPlan's budget cuts, faculty cuts,<br />\nand student increases in very different ways.

The card is<br />\ngood for a full school year, after<br />\nwhich any remaining money in<br />\nthe account will be forfeited.<br />\nMr.Krouse would not reveal<br />\nthe reason for this policy, saying<br />\nonly that \"If a student is aware<br />\nof what they're spending, there<br />\nis no reason that they should have<br />\na balance outstanding.

The<br />\nHopkins liberal arts could unite on three levels to produce<br />\na working raison cretre as an academic institution: professional (i.e., research and teaching), graduate (teaching<br />\nand learning), and undergraduate (learning). The goal for<br />\neach of these subdivisions should be not merely to re-label<br />\nthe current state of affairs (as a unique example of The<br />\nHopkins Experience), but rather, to set a new philosophical<br />\nstandard upon which all departments can build.<br />\nThe initial question here should not be a fiscal one. The<br />\nMission should delineate a philosophical standard for the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University of the future, as Johns Hopkins<br />\nhimself did when he founded the University. Rather than<br />\nallow Arts and Sciences to further dissolve into the<br />\nhomogenized national model, this a chance to restore the<br />\nfaculty to their role as a source of administrative policy.<br />\nBut the faculty must instigate this change; if they are divided in their support, the rest of the University will be as<br />\nwell.<br />\nA way might be found to revive a unique, and now<br />\nlargely defunct Hopkins tradition: dynamic graduate and<br />\nundergraduate interaction in the classroom, taking into account conventional realities. To acknowledge the importance of undergraduate education at Hopkins (far greater<br />\nthan at the University's founding in 1876), a tutorial system<br />\non the British model\u2014with graduate students from<br />\ndisciplines as diverse as history and medicine\u2014could<br />\nreturn to the residence halls. Although such systems exist, to an extent, at several institutions, Hopkins' edge could<br />\nlie in its traditionally integrated classrooms.<br />\nAlthough such programs may eventually require more<br />\nmoney, in the short run, a galvanizing Mission will accomplish far more than dollars alone.

I was dating a Southern<br />\nBaptist, what they call a \"footwashin\"'Baptist, by the name of<br />\nKelly Pomroy. She was a dancer<br />\nwith dirty blonde hair and ice<br />\nblue eyes and a lilt underneath her<br />\n\"o's\" that still made my knees<br />\nbuckle. I'll be the first to admit<br />\nthat my interest was physical. Initially. But she was so damn<br />\nsweet and innocent that my fancy started running deep early on.<br />\nThen she broke up with me.<br />\n\"I can't give you what you<br />\nwant,\" she told me. What did I<br />\nwant? I asked her. \"I think you<br />\nwant to understand,\" she said.<br />\nUnderstand? Understand what?<br />\n\"I don't know,\" she said (making my knees buckle twice). \"If<br />\nI did, I might be able to help<br />\nyou.\"<br />\nWell, I suppose in one sense<br />\nshe was right. I wanted to understand why the hell she had broken<br />\nup with me. To show her that I<br />\nalready understood, I took her on<br />\non her own turf; I figured this<br />\nway I could win her back.<br /><br />\nHE SAYS HE 1iA5<br />\nVOY MUCJI ENTOYEL<br />\nH15 VISIT, AND wout,p<br />\nLIKE To KNOW IF MYONE 15 iktrat-srep iJ<br />\nMAKIN&amp; ANOTHO \"RA_WA .<br />\nRUN.<br /><br />\nUnfortunately, her home turf<br />\nhad an awful lot to do with God,<br />\nand where I was long on patience,<br />\nI was way short on faith.<br />\n\"I don't get it,\" I'd say. \"You<br />\nbelieve in a little old man, with<br />\nwhite hair and a beard who sits<br />\non a throne in a cloud city.\"<br />\n\"Yes. Not as such, but yes.\"<br />\n\"And you're sure that when<br />\npeople die, they meet this guy?\"<br />\nDeath was one of those things that<br />\nI was really fuzzy about.<br />\n\"Yes.\" She wasn't.<br />\n\"But how do you be sure?<br />\nWhat about the wars in Central<br />\nAmerica, the Cold War\u2014even<br />\npeople who worship God fight<br />\nover who's right!

She was<br />\nright. She couldn't give me what<br />\nI wanted, assuming that what I<br />\nwanted was to understand, and<br />\nwhy would I have argued so<br />\nmuch had I wanted otherwise?<br />\nAll this meant that we should<br />\nnever have been together, and as<br />\nsuch I should have been happy,<br />\nor at least relieved, right?<br />\nI wasn't. I was miserable. I<br />\nadded another item to that growing list of things about which I<br />\nwas sans clue: females.<br />\nBut Kelly couldn't prove that<br />\nGod existed, she just believed. So<br />\nI figured my ideas were as good<br />\nas hers, which were as good as<br />\nanybody else's. I started reading<br />\nthe works of other philosophers<br />\nto see what the big ideas were. I<br />\neven signed up for a course at a<br />\nlocal college to learn more names<br />\nto look into. It was here that I<br />\nlearned about pantheism and<br />\nBaruch Spinoza.<br />\nBaruch Spinoza once theorized that the Universe as we know<br />\nit is composed of smaller parts,<br />\nknown as monads. These monads<br />\ninclude everything from everyday<br />\nitems, such as videocassettes and<br />\nScrabble and coffee makers, to<br />\nlarger, more abstract items and<br />\nideas, such as politics, death, men<br /><br />\nand women. And all of these<br />\nmonads, when considered<br />\ntogether, are God. And for<br />\nSpinoza, the only real learning in<br />\nlife is learning about God.<br />\nI wanted to learn to write. That<br />\nwas what I wanted to go to college for, anyway. I figured if I<br />\ncould master writing, then write<br />\nabout God, according to this guy<br />\nSpinoza, I could write about<br />\neverything.<br />\nTo prepare myself financially<br />\nfor college I got a job at a local<br />\nbookstore, knowing that the cash<br />\nI received from my relatives for<br />\ngraduation wouldn't subsidize my<br />\nfunds much.<br />\nI found upon receipt of my first<br />\npaycheck that money bought<br />\nthings I wanted. Lots of themand not just books, either. As a<br />\nresult, whereas most of my fellow<br />\nclassmates at Hopkins arrived<br />\nwith a tidy little kitty of money,<br />\nI got here with $200. Though I<br />\ndid have one hell of a stereo. And<br />\na coffee maker. And Scrabble.<br />\nThe result? By the end of my<br />\nfreshman year, I came to the conclusion that not being able to<br />\nbalance my checkbook really<br />\nwasn't a problem, since all I did<br />\nwas deposit my paycheck then<br />\nwrite a check out for that amount<br />\nto one person or another.<br />\nThat's why I put in the application for the American Express<br />\ncard then. It was just the thing for<br />\nthe financial failure like me.<br />\nBesides, I was only going to use<br />\nit in emergencies, right?<br />\nI showed it to all my friends.<br />\nThey likewise were very impressed, though many of them<br />\nwondered why I had gotten a<br />\ncharge card rather than a credit<br />\ncard. I wasn't really sure what<br />\nthey meant by this, but I didn't<br />\nwant to seem an idiot, so I said,<br />\n\"Well, this way, I have to pay it<br />\nall at the end of the month, so it<br />\nwill help me keep my money<br />\nstraight, and it will keep me<br />\nresponsible.\"<br />\nBut others of my friends seemed frightened. \"Chris, didn't you<br />\nbounce two checks last year on<br />\nyour checking account?\" Well,<br />\nyeah. \"So what are you doing<br />\nSee PUNCHLINE, 5.<br /><br />\nparts and help to placate the destructive forces which have<br />\narrived with fiscal uncertainty.<br />\nThe essence of the Mission should be to redefine the<br />\nUniversity, to rediscover what it is that should set Hopkins<br />\napart from peer institutions.

For those of you new to Homewood, Hoppy Hour is one of the few campus social events around<br />\nwhich a wide cross section of the Hopkins community<br />\nrallies. Not only does this event bring a relaxing close to<br />\nthe busy work week, welcoming in the weekend, but provides a casual atmosphere for students, professors, and<br />\nadminsistration to mix outside of the usual formal<br />\nconstraints.<br />\nThis year, the HOP Social Committee has made a few<br />\nnew policies to help ensure that Hoppie Hour will continue. The biggest change consists of the hiring of Stiiu<br />\ndent Activities Office Event Managers to check IDs,'tun<br />\nthe taps, and generally keep an eye on things as the fun<br />\ngets under way. This new delegation of responsibility for<br />\ndrinking age enforcement promises to make the job of<br />\nevent organizers less stressful, and will almost certainly<br />\nresult in improved programming. Ten Hoppy Hours are<br />\nplanned for this semester, and with the addition of weekly live entertainment and wine coolers, the popularity of<br />\nthe event promises to increase apace. We are hopeful that<br />\nan even larger number of Hoppy Hours will be held in<br />\nthe spring, with permanent resolution of the Glass Pavilion<br />\nscheduling conflicts which plagued last year's event.<br />\nThe Social Committee, which has planned an October<br />\nFest for next month along with a Monday night Sports Extravaganza in the Rat (replete with 50\" television and<br />\nserious food), should be commended for its dedication to<br />\nmaking the Hopkins experience a little better for everyone.<br />\nAnyone who has had anything to do with programming<br />\nat Homewood knows how difficult it can be to get regular<br />\nprogramming off the ground, but the Social Committee<br />\nhas done this and shows no signs of resting upon its laurels.<br />\nSee you at the Glass Pay!<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nWillmann 1<br />\nTo the Editors<br />\nOn Monday, September 18,<br />\nJenifer Willmann, a housemaster<br />\nin Building B, was forced to<br />\nresign her position.

Clearly, Residential Life feels<br />\nthe situation must be quite grave<br />\nif it requires this drastic step.<br />\nNone of us know what happened, and we wonder why, if it was<br />\nso obvious, did none of us see<br />\nanything wrong.<br />\nNow they will have to find a<br />\nsubstitute for Jen, but they can<br />\nnever replace her. Many of us are<br />\nstill very disillusioned and confused by the whole situation.<br />\nDavid Ross<br />\nWillmann 2<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nOn Monday, September 18,<br />\nJenifer Willmann was asked by<br />\nthe office of Residential Life to<br />\nas<br />\nposition<br />\nher<br />\nresign<br />\nhousemaster of Building B. I met<br />\nwith both Andrea Perry and<br />\nSharon Reynolds that day and<br />\nwas told that Jen's resignation<br />\nwas made \"voluntarily\" after<br />\nseveral charges had been brought<br />\nagainst her. I question how<br />\n\"voluntary\" her decision was,<br />\nespecially since I had spoken with<br />\nher the night before and she<br />\nreassured me that she loved her<br />\nposition as Housemaster, and<br />\nwould not give it up unless forced. What Andrea told me was an<br />\noutright lie, as were several<br />\nthings I was told by Andrea and<br /><br />\nSharon.<br />\nI asked whether or not thet6<br />\nwas actual evidence that Jen had<br />\ndone something wrong. I was told<br />\nthat there were several instances<br />\nwhere Residential Life staff<br />\nmembers and other Housemasters<br />\nbreaking<br />\nobserved<br />\nJen<br />\nHousemaster rules. What they<br />\nshould have told me was that they<br />\nwere basing accusations on hearsay and that they didn't have any<br />\nsolid evidence to back it up.<br />\nI asked why Jennifer was asked to resign her position but was<br />\ngiven no definite answer. Andrea<br />\nvery skillfully talked her way<br />\naround my question, saying thal<br />\nthere were differences in Jen'i<br />\npersonality and lifestyle that<br />\nclashed with the expectations of<br />\nResidential Life. My point is that<br />\nyou can't ask someone to resign<br />\njust because you disagree with<br />\nher personality.<br />\nOn Monday night, the residents<br />\nof Building B were asked by the<br />\nstaff of Residential Life to meet<br />\nwith them to discuss what happened to Jen, and what would<br />\nhappen next. All of those who at<br />\ntended that meeting hoped to hear<br />\nwhy Jen was being taken from us.<br />\nAgain, we were disappointed.<br />\nWe spent over an hour talking<br />\nwith Andrea and her two<br />\nassistants, Sharon and Dorothy.<br />\nTo my knowledge, not one of Oa<br />\nquestions were answered.<br />\nIn a letter to our dorm on Monday afternoon, Residential Life<br />\ntold us, \"We know what an imdifference<br />\nportant<br />\nyour<br />\nHousemasters can make in your<br />\nfreshman year experience.\" 1<br />\nquestion whether they really do<br />\nor not. I can speak for the rest of<br />\nthe dorm when I say that we are<br />\nvery close to Jen. She is exactly<br />\nwhat she should be; a confidante,<br />\na friend, a disciplinarian, and someone we all can count on. Jen<br />\nwas taken from us because of<br />\nbaseless lies and rumors, and was<br />\nnot given a chance to defend<br />\nherself.

In addition, this city<br />\nfair would entice newcomers and<br />\nBaltimore families to remain<br />\nwithin the city and stem the tide<br />\ntowards the suburbs.<br />\nStarting from its original 16<br />\nneighborhoods in 1970, the 1989<br />\nCity Fair hosts 56 neighborhoods<br />\nand community centers.

Perhaps more important, she's an idiot.<br />\nHer high school diploma transforms her into a<br />\nwalking question mark\u2014about her boyfriend, her<br />\nfather, and her future. Sam's father died in the<br />\nwar when she was still in utero, and she has never<br /><br />\nRECORD<br /><br />\nknown much about him.(He married her mother<br />\nonly a month before he was sent to Vietnam.)<br />\nSam peppers Emmett with questions(\"What's<br />\na frag?\") and he usually answers noncommitally. He doesn't think Sam will understand his situation, and isn't really convinced that she cares to.<br />\nThis isn't surprising, because most of the time,<br />\nSam is a veritable tub of glee. Her father's death<br />\n(to take one example) seems only to bother her<br />\namong other things.<br />\nIn an early scene, Sam is sprawled on her bed,<br />\nwondering both what her father was like and how<br />\nshe might manage to buy a car\u2014so she can go to<br />\nthe mall. What director Jewison intends to be<br />\nrevelatory is only embarrassing. Later, Sam mounts<br />\na picture ot her father on her mirror and laments,<br />\n\"You missed Watergate, `E.T.,' the Bruce<br />\nSpringsteen concert!\" Somehow, one suspects that<br />\nshe missed them, too.<br />\nSam's ignorance about Vietnam is difficult to<br />\nbelieve.

What the titles don't convey .is how deeply the Pixies wade into their<br />\nmaterial, adding layer after layer of irony and<br />\ntight, confident playing.<br />\n\"Doolittle\" (4AD/Elektra; LP, CD, and<br />\ncassette), the band's recent album, is a record with<br />\na short attention span.

And<br />\nmore often than not, the new song sounds like it<br />\nfits\u2014a weird, catchy extension of the first tune.<br />\nCatchiness, after weirdness, neatly defines the<br />\nPixies' best element. Though \"Doolittle\" contains<br />\nsnatches of punk, hardcore, and heavy metal, it<br />\ncoughs up equal doses of 1950s pop, surf music,<br />\n\"spaghetti western\" guitar, and more.

The song \"Cracicity<br />\nJones,\" which clocks in at under a minute and<br />\na half, combines the nonstop furor of hardcore<br />\npunk with a mock-Spanish vocal. \"Here Comes<br />\nYour Man\" mates a 1950s pop sound with<br />\nominous, angst-ridden singing: so strange is Francis' delivery that the man in the title might be<br />\nreturning from prison, or a mental institution.<br />\nBut like the Doctor for whom it is named,<br />\n\"Doolittle\" speaks in a score of arcane languages;<br />\nwe can't understand all of them.

The first feature in the series, \"The 5,000<br />\nfingers of Dr. T.,\" is a 1953 film written and<br />\ndesigned by Dr. Seuss. It tells the story of a boy,<br />\na young piano student, who falls asleep one night<br />\nand dreams up the sinister Dr. T.<br />\nIn the dream, Dr. T. kidnaps young piano<br />\nstudents and takes them to his kingdom.

You're not alone. According to<br />\nDr. David Dinges, a psychologist<br />\nand sleep researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, most of us<br />\nought to take naps. Brain-wave<br />\nstudies have shown that humans<br />\nhave an inherent tendency to sleep<br />\nTWICE a day\"- once in the evening and one other time, usually in the<br />\nmid-to-late afternoon. In fact,<br />\nresearchers from Boston and West<br />\nGermany put volunteers in<br />\nunderground rooms for weeks at a<br />\ntime, isolated from all indications of<br />\ntime with instructions to sleep<br />\n\"whenever they wanted.' They<br />\nfound that most subjects slept in two<br />\nperiods\u2014a long session at night and<br />\na shorter period of one to two hours<br />\nin the afternoon.<br />\nEven if you get a normal amount<br />\nof sleep at night, you will still tend<br />\nto be less accurate, even sluggish<br />\ntowards the middle of the day, say<br />\nsleep researchers at Montreal<br />\nHospital. Although many people attribute this drowsiness to having<br /><br />\neaten a heavy lunch, Roger<br />\nBroughton, a neurology professor at<br />\nthe University of Ottawa, says that<br />\ntime of day is the key factor in determining a person's degree of<br />\nalertness.<br />\nSo when is the \"right\" time to<br />\nnap? The average person will be<br />\nready for a nap about twelve hours<br />\nafter their middle period of sleep.<br />\nFor example, if you normally sleep<br /><br />\nfrom 2 am to 8 am, your body is<br />\nmost highly primed for napping<br />\naround 5 pm. While surveys show<br />\nthat about 55 percent of all college<br />\nstudents do nap regularly, they may<br />\nnot be getting the full benefits of the<br />\nextra sleep because they probably<br />\nonly lie down when they absolutely<br />\ncan't stay awake. To prevent this<br />\nkind of debilitating fatigue, Martin<br />\nOrne of the University of Pennsylvania, suggests \"prophylactic<br />\nnapping\", napping before you<br />\nbecome exhausted, instead.<br />\n\"Cat flappers\" are worse off than<br />\nthose who don't nap at all. Experiments have revealed that a ten to<br />\nfifteen minute siesta is too short to<br />\nimprove performance significantly,<br />\nlargely due to the fact that only the<br />\nfirst stage of sleep is reached during<br /><br />\nthis period, and it is the deeper<br />\nstages which seem to enhance alertness. So if you want to improve your<br />\ngrades, take a half-hour nap before<br />\nstudying for, or taking, that big exam. Psychologist John M. Taub of<br />\nSt. Louis, along with other i\u2022esearchers, has found that people perform<br />\nmore quickly and accurately after<br />\ntaking a short nap than before. Not<br />\nonly that, but they are said to be<br />\nmore cheerful and have better recall.<br />\nIf it is so beneficial, why don't<br />\nmore people take the time to rest?<br />\n\"Our society looks down on naps,\"<br />\nsays Dr. Dinges. \"When time is<br />\nregarded as money, napping is viewed as wasteful and self-indulgent.\"<br />\nDr. Dinges' research suggests that<br />\nafternoon naps would increase productivity among all groups of people. On the practical side, however,<br />\nnapping could prove dangerous for<br />\nthose who must work with toxic<br />\nchemicals or heavy machinery immediately after awakening. \"Sleep<br />\ninertia,\" the intense grogginess and<br />\nconfusion that result when a person<br />\nis suddenly awakened, lasts a few<br />\nminutes. Experts advise that no one<br />\nshould engage in any complicated<br />\nactivity until sleep inertia wears off.<br /><br />\nJohn Misa<br /><br />\nIs this your problem too? Perhaps you should fit a nap into your schedule.<br /><br />\nKeeping the Bay clean is everyone's responsibility<br />\nby<br />\nSharyn<br />\nHorowitz<br />\nThe Chesapeake Bay is a<br />\nresource for food and recreation,<br />\nthe winter home for thousands of<br />\nNorth American birds, and the<br />\nlargest estuary in the world. Unfortunately, this magnificent body<br />\nof water and its inhabitants have<br />\nbeen hurt by modern civilization.<br /><br />\nJust in the last twenty years, the<br />\noyster harvest has dropped by<br />\ntwo-thirds and 60 percent of the<br />\nBay's submerged aquatic vegetation, underwater plants that produce oxygen and food for Bay<br />\nanimals, has disappeared.<br />\nWho should be blamed?<br />\nCallous corporations and careless<br /><br />\nmunicipalities?

Ni;.:e's assertive<br />\nslogan implies th:it all we need to<br />\novercome procrastination and get<br />\ndown to the setious work of exercising is a pair of costly, new<br />\nsneakers. In fact, initiating a<br />\nfitness program takes a little more<br />\ntime (and u little less cash than the<br />\npeople a'. Nike would have you<br />\nbelieve).<br />\nTo begin a successful course of<br />\nexercise requires that, from the<br />\nstart, you must trade in the idea<br />\nthat physical soundness can come<br />\nin an instant (that it can be purchased in the form of a pill or as<br />\nathletic gear) for the idea that<br />\nfitness will come after a time of<br />\ndedicated workouts.<br />\nJoanne McGurney, Johns<br />\nHopkins Women's Athletic<br />\nTrainer, stresses that when beginning a fitness program you need<br />\nto think along two routes. First:<br />\n\"Find something that you enjoy<br />\n'doing. That is the way to maintain the program.\" Suggested<br />\nways of training ranged from running, swimming, and bicycling to<br />\nracquetball, walking, and weight<br />\nlifting.<br />\nMcGurney says,<br />\n\"Whatever you feel good about<br />\ndoing is what you're likely to<br />\nstick with.\" Second: \"Along<br />\nwith that, be realistic about how<br />\nthe exercise will affect your body.<br />\nIf you want to work off extra<br />\npounds, a ten-minute walk every<br />\nother day won't be of much help,<br />\nno matter how enjoyable.\" The<br />\nquick message is that you must<br />\ndecide what kind of improvement<br />\nyou are after, then find exercises<br />\nthat will allow you to achieve<br />\nyour goals and that you'll look<br />\nforward to doing.<br />\nOne good way to exercise is<br />\nthrough<br />\ncross-training.<br />\nMcGurney stresses that generally there is \"better success with<br />\nvaried activities.\" Choosing different programs to pursue (such<br />\nas the \"triathlete\" program:<br />\nalternating days of running and<br />\nbiking and swimming)decreases<br />\nthe chances of the workouts<br /><br />\nbecoming<br />\nboring<br />\nand<br />\nsimultaneously decreases the risk<br />\nof injury caused by working the<br />\nsame muscle group repeatedly.<br />\n\"Additionally, varying the exercises will help your overall toning,\" says McGurney.<br />\nEven with great plans of action,<br />\nmany people find they cannot<br />\nfollow through on a fitness program. Common reasons for abandoning an exercise program are<br />\ndisappointment with early results,<br />\ninjury, and the lack of time or effort to continue. Disappointment<br />\nwith results is usually because the<br />\nprogram is inadequate to achieve<br />\nthe desired goals. For example,<br />\nthe person who hopes to lose<br />\nweight by jogging every day but<br />\nguzzling beer at night will find his<br />\napproach to fitness hopeless.<br />\nFitness can not be reached on<br />\na single level. You must develop<br />\na frame of mind that encourages<br />\nthe seeking of health on all levels,<br />\nincluding nutritional and emotional health. McGurney says that<br />\none must have a reasonable frame<br />\nof mind: \"You have to look at it<br />\nas a change in lifestyle. You can't<br />\ninstitute a realistic program if you<br />\nhave many other things to worry<br />\nabout.\"<br />\nCases where people attempt to<br />\npursue serious fitness without<br />\naltering their lifestyle lead to what<br />\nMcGurney calls a \"cycle of<br />\nfatigue.\" When someone gets little sleep and eats poorly\u2014either<br />\ntoo much or too little\u2014then trying to keep up with a fitness program can become more problematic than helpful.<br />\nIn dietary terms, McGurney<br />\npoints out that \"not much has to<br />\nbe incorporated unless you are<br />\naiming to be an endurance<br />\nathlete.\" You should eat normally, trying to increase carbohydrates and decrease the intake of fat and sugar.(The possi<br />\nble exception being the case<br />\nwhere a person loses too much<br />\nblood sugar while exercising and<br />\nrisks fainting spells.) Looking at<br />\nfitness in a wholistic way can<br />\ndramatically improve the chances<br /><br />\n\u2022 of success.<br />\nInjury can be avoided by starting slowly and working up the<br />\npace or impact incrementally.<br />\nFiguring out a simple warm-up or<br />\nstretching program (by working<br />\non what is \"tight\") can also<br />\ndebilrease the chance of a pulled<br />\nmuscle. Most people will be sore<br />\nafter their first few workouts, and<br />\nthat is normal--it lets the person<br />\nknow that his/her muscles have<br />\nbeen brought to higher levels.<br />\nMcGurney warns the novice<br />\nathlete to use common sense and<br />\nnot mistake general soreness for<br />\nmore painful and serious injury.<br />\nA harder problem to deal with<br />\nis the lack of time to follow<br />\nthrough on a fitness program.<br />\nThere are, frankly, bad times to<br />\nstart a fitness program. In the<br />\nmidst of overwhelming academic<br />\npressure, a fitness program will<br />\nstruggle to find a spot on the list<br />\nof things to do today.<br />\nMcGurney's advice is to wait<br />\nuntil you are ready and able to<br />\nembark on serious exercise and<br />\nthen understand that there are<br />\ndays when you will not be able<br />\nto find the time to work out.<br />\nMissing an occasional day of exercise, while it might make you<br />\nfeel guilty, shouldn't lead to the<br />\ncollapse of your fitness routine.<br />\n\"Be flexible with yourself and go<br />\nwith your instincts. If you feel<br />\nyou have to miss a day or two,<br />\nthat's okay.\"<br />\nExercise, especially for the<br />\nuniversity student, can be an unparalleled tension release. Used<br />\nwisely, a fitness program can improve your mood, your sleeping<br />\nand eating habits, and perhaps<br />\neven your grades. Exercise can<br />\nbecome work, though. But, as<br />\nMcGurney states, the bottom line<br />\nis,\"You should be doing it for<br />\nfun.\" So that once you find a program that is both enjoyable and<br />\nphysically rewarding, you<br />\nshouldn't need a pair of sleek<br />\nshoes to motivate you to excel.<br /><br />\nShort<br />\nShots<br />\nBy Rachel McGuckian<br /><br />\nSwarthmore overwhelms the Hopkins defense.<br /><br />\nFootball falls, 38-6<br />\nFOOTBALL, from 11<br />\nwe cannot let ourselves get<br />\ndown.\"<br />\nCornerback and tri-captain Jeff<br />\nSheaffer commented on the letdown of the Hopkins defense:<br />\n\"The parts of our team that were<br />\nthought our strong points, had<br />\nsome major letdowns in Friday's<br />\ngame.
