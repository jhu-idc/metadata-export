Fifty-nine<br />\nin itself is not particularly startling:<br />\nsixty would have been better. And yet<br />\nit so happens that this otherwise undistinguished odd year marks a crucial point in the University's career.<br />\nAt its founding, the Hopkins was a<br />\nlittle dream-place where men sincerely believed that the mind was splendid as well as respectable. It was the<br />\nforemost institution in the country in<br />\nthe realm of higher scientific research \u2014 being a pioneer and, very<br />\nprobably, the inspiration for the present army of research men storming<br />\nthe barriers of the abstract. In practically all its branches, it led the<br />\nfield. And in the course of its history,<br />\nfour presidents \u2014 four distinguished<br />\nscholars\u2014have maintained that original ideal to the best of their ability\u2014<br />\nfirst, Dr. Gilman; second, Dr. Remsen; third, Dr. Goodnow; and now Dr.<br />\nAmes.

Where will he turn?<br />\nThat fifth miist face a somewhat<br />\ndifferent Hopkins than that optimistic little school described above.<br />\nThrough the lack of benificence on<br />\nthe part of the Baltimore financial tycoons or maybe through other reasons, the Hopkins has undeniably lost<br />\nits leadership in many fields. The<br />\nMedical School alone stands with its<br />\noriginal glory.<br />\nBut that is not for us to talk about.<br />\nOur little province is the undergraduate campus\u2014and it hurts us to report that the mind is certainly not a<br />\nsplendid thing here. College for most<br />\nof us is little more than a feather to<br />\nbe plucked after four years and then<br />\nstuck into our caps. Wine and women<br />\nare exalted here as in the days of ancient Babylon. Even song is more-orless discredited; or, at best, subverted into a type of Indian tom-tom hysteria. In all truth, we can report that<br />\nPresident Gilman's noble thoughts<br />\nhave descended through the chasm of<br />\nfifty-nine years \u2014 and, have been<br />\ncrushed on the rocks of Levering Hall.<br />\n'rom the other side of the campus<br />\nconie other cries of \"Down With Gilman.\" The workers are oppressed and<br />\nhutigry out in the world beyond the<br />\nwalUs. And many of our colleagues<br />\nha re identified themselves with these<br />\nmi Jerable ones. They have stepped<br />\nintc) their shoes. Thus, instead of being<br />\npus'e scholars, they are half-ragamuffini3 and half-themselves. And it is<br />\nneedless to say that that hungry-half<br />\nis E wretched thinker\u2014and a bigoted<br />\nobserver of all that enters its ken. A<br />\nhutigry man cannot afford to believe<br />\nthe,t the mind is splendid. These collea,guest too, are no longer true to the<br />\nocc'asion they celebrate on this day.<br />\n<br />\nNo More Puns<br />\nWe of the new editorial regime<br />\nwant to make it perfectly clear where<br />\nwe stand on puns. We want to inform<br />\nour readers in no uncertain terms.<br />\nLet us. declare ourselves now and forever. We hate them!<br />\nOur predecessors were not so sensitive. There were homely little artifices on every page. Double-meanings<br />\nand ludicrous ambiguities stared at us<br />\nfrom around front-page pictures. PreElizabethan devices adorned the headlines and the most dignified articles<br />\nlike the bells on the cap of a PreElizabethan clown. You couldn't miss<br />\nthem. You got tangled up in them.<br />\nAnd it was revolting.<br />\nTo us, puns are fit preoccupation<br />\nfor only the smallest of minds. They<br />\nrepresent an interest in the vulgar<br />\npaints of thought rather than in the<br />\nthoughts themselves. Puns are surface rather than content. They are an<br />\nescape from an intelligible communication. It is probable that the punster above referred to is much more<br />\ninterested in a woman's cosmetics<br />\nthan in the woman herself. A sad<br />\nstate, indeed.<br />\nBut, the most vicious application of<br />\npuns was evident in their use in moreor-less sacred places. A pun over the<br />\npicture of a venerable gentleman at<br />\nonce introduces the absurd where it<br />\ndoesn't belong. But the absurdity reflects not so much on the gentleman<br />\nas on the punster. He has jingled his<br />\nclownish bells where solemn robes<br />\nwere required\u2014and I'm sure he would<br />\nadmit that solemnity is sometimes desirable. It's as if in Milton's \"Paradise<br />\nLost\", Adam had quizzed his guest,<br />\nSatan, as to whether the devil really<br />\nbelieved that \"the pun was there to<br />\nslay.\" Thank God that Milton had<br />\nbetter sense!<br />\nAnd that is not all. If that flippancy<br />\nwere really an attempt to show the inherent smallness of things in the<br />\ngreat cosmos, then it failed miserably.<br />\nThat punning business was just as<br />\ninadequate as the trite, little aphorism of Oscar Wilde. For example<br />\nWilde said, \"How pleasing to meet a<br />\nobscure person\" \u2014 a flippant halftruth. But the world always said<br />\n\"How pleasing to meet a distinguished person\"\u2014obviously, the other halftruth. Wilde then is just as witty an<br />\nshallow as the world. Ah, but the<br />\nwhole truth! If we had real perception into the universe and wished t<br />\nmake an appropriate remark, full o<br />\nprofundity, we would in our turn exclaim, \"My, but how pleasing to meet.<br />\na member of the species.\"<br />\n\u2014E.K.<br />\n<br />\nYale's New Coaehf 0.1<br />\nIt is an athletic anomaly that Dr.<br />\nRay Van Orman, All-American end<br />\nand nationally-known football coach<br />\nbefore he thought of lacrosse, should<br />\nfurther his athletic career as lacrosse<br />\ncoach of a great institution.<br />\nUndoubtedly the quality of Yale<br />\nlacrosse will improve under Van's<br />\nguidance, but he will find himself in<br />\nthe unaccustomed role of having to<br />\nteach the fundamentals of the game.<br />\nFurthermore, he will not find his cohorts as aclmowledgedly capable as<br />\nhis old associates, simply because the<br />\nmen at Hopkins are born with lacrosse sticks in their hands.<br />\nBecause of this, no one should expect to see Yale threaten in lacrosse<br />\nranks this year or even next year.<br />\nOnly by inducing experienced high<br />\nschool players to adopt Yale and thus<br />\nInitiate a wave of lacrosse interest<br />\ncan that institution ever hope to rival<br />\na Maryland college in the old Indian<br />\ngame.<br />\nHowever, if Van can succeed in<br />\nspreading enthusiasm for the sport<br />\namong the good people of New Haven<br />\nhe may surprise yet.

The University<br />\nwas launched in 1876.

And yet<br />\nit so happens that this otherwise undistinguished odd year marks a crucial point in the University's career.<br />\nAt its founding, the Hopkins was a<br />\nlittle dream-place where men sincerely believed that the mind was splendid as well as respectable. It was the<br />\nforemost institution in the country in<br />\nthe realm of higher scientific research \u2014 being a pioneer and, very<br />\nprobably, the inspiration for the present army of research men storming<br />\nthe barriers of the abstract. In practically all its branches, it led the<br />\nfield. And in the course of its history,<br />\nfour presidents \u2014 four distinguished<br />\nscholars\u2014have maintained that original ideal to the best of their ability\u2014<br />\nfirst, Dr. Gilman; second, Dr. Remsen; third, Dr. Goodnow; and now Dr.<br />\nAmes. A fifth will soon take his place<br />\nin the procession. Where will he turn?<br />\nThat fifth miist face a somewhat<br />\ndifferent Hopkins than that optimistic little school described above.<br />\nThrough the lack of benificence on<br />\nthe part of the Baltimore financial tycoons or maybe through other reasons, the Hopkins has undeniably lost<br />\nits leadership in many fields. The<br />\nMedical School alone stands with its<br />\noriginal glory.<br />\nBut that is not for us to talk about.<br />\nOur little province is the undergraduate campus\u2014and it hurts us to report that the mind is certainly not a<br />\nsplendid thing here. College for most<br />\nof us is little more than a feather to<br />\nbe plucked after four years and then<br />\nstuck into our caps. Wine and women<br />\nare exalted here as in the days of ancient Babylon. Even song is more-orless discredited; or, at best, subverted into a type of Indian tom-tom hysteria. In all truth, we can report that<br />\nPresident Gilman's noble thoughts<br />\nhave descended through the chasm of<br />\nfifty-nine years \u2014 and, have been<br />\ncrushed on the rocks of Levering Hall.<br />\n'rom the other side of the campus<br />\nconie other cries of \"Down With Gilman.\" The workers are oppressed and<br />\nhutigry out in the world beyond the<br />\nwalUs. And many of our colleagues<br />\nha re identified themselves with these<br />\nmi Jerable ones. They have stepped<br />\nintc) their shoes. Thus, instead of being<br />\npus'e scholars, they are half-ragamuffini3 and half-themselves. And it is<br />\nneedless to say that that hungry-half<br />\nis E wretched thinker\u2014and a bigoted<br />\nobserver of all that enters its ken. A<br />\nhutigry man cannot afford to believe<br />\nthe,t the mind is splendid. These collea,guest too, are no longer true to the<br />\nocc'asion they celebrate on this day.<br /><br />\nNo More Puns<br />\nWe of the new editorial regime<br />\nwant to make it perfectly clear where<br />\nwe stand on puns. We want to inform<br />\nour readers in no uncertain terms.<br />\nLet us. declare ourselves now and forever. We hate them!<br />\nOur predecessors were not so sensitive. There were homely little artifices on every page. Double-meanings<br />\nand ludicrous ambiguities stared at us<br />\nfrom around front-page pictures. PreElizabethan devices adorned the headlines and the most dignified articles<br />\nlike the bells on the cap of a PreElizabethan clown. You couldn't miss<br />\nthem. You got tangled up in them.<br />\nAnd it was revolting.<br />\nTo us, puns are fit preoccupation<br />\nfor only the smallest of minds. They<br />\nrepresent an interest in the vulgar<br />\npaints of thought rather than in the<br />\nthoughts themselves. Puns are surface rather than content. They are an<br />\nescape from an intelligible communication. It is probable that the punster above referred to is much more<br />\ninterested in a woman's cosmetics<br />\nthan in the woman herself. A sad<br />\nstate, indeed.<br />\nBut, the most vicious application of<br />\npuns was evident in their use in moreor-less sacred places. A pun over the<br />\npicture of a venerable gentleman at<br />\nonce introduces the absurd where it<br />\ndoesn't belong. But the absurdity reflects not so much on the gentleman<br />\nas on the punster. He has jingled his<br />\nclownish bells where solemn robes<br />\nwere required\u2014and I'm sure he would<br />\nadmit that solemnity is sometimes desirable. It's as if in Milton's \"Paradise<br />\nLost\", Adam had quizzed his guest,<br />\nSatan, as to whether the devil really<br />\nbelieved that \"the pun was there to<br />\nslay.\" Thank God that Milton had<br />\nbetter sense!<br />\nAnd that is not all. If that flippancy<br />\nwere really an attempt to show the inherent smallness of things in the<br />\ngreat cosmos, then it failed miserably.<br />\nThat punning business was just as<br />\ninadequate as the trite, little aphorism of Oscar Wilde. For example<br />\nWilde said, \"How pleasing to meet a<br />\nobscure person\" \u2014 a flippant halftruth. But the world always said<br />\n\"How pleasing to meet a distinguished person\"\u2014obviously, the other halftruth. Wilde then is just as witty an<br />\nshallow as the world. Ah, but the<br />\nwhole truth! If we had real perception into the universe and wished t<br />\nmake an appropriate remark, full o<br />\nprofundity, we would in our turn exclaim, \"My, but how pleasing to meet.<br />\na member of the species.\"<br />\n\u2014E.K.<br /><br />\nYale's New Coaehf 0.1<br />\nIt is an athletic anomaly that Dr.<br />\nRay Van Orman, All-American end<br />\nand nationally-known football coach<br />\nbefore he thought of lacrosse, should<br />\nfurther his athletic career as lacrosse<br />\ncoach of a great institution.<br />\nUndoubtedly the quality of Yale<br />\nlacrosse will improve under Van's<br />\nguidance, but he will find himself in<br />\nthe unaccustomed role of having to<br />\nteach the fundamentals of the game.<br />\nFurthermore, he will not find his cohorts as aclmowledgedly capable as<br />\nhis old associates, simply because the<br />\nmen at Hopkins are born with lacrosse sticks in their hands.<br />\nBecause of this, no one should expect to see Yale threaten in lacrosse<br />\nranks this year or even next year.<br />\nOnly by inducing experienced high<br />\nschool players to adopt Yale and thus<br />\nInitiate a wave of lacrosse interest<br />\ncan that institution ever hope to rival<br />\na Maryland college in the old Indian<br />\ngame.<br />\nHowever, if Van can succeed in<br />\nspreading enthusiasm for the sport<br />\namong the good people of New Haven<br />\nhe may surprise yet.

The University<br />\nwas launched in 1876. Adhering<br />\nclosely to their principles, Gilman and<br />\nhis associates put their heart and<br />\nsoul into the job and even in less<br />\nthan half a dozen years' existence the<br />\nJohns Hopkins<br />\n. .. round the punctual sun<br />\nHas she, old Learning's latest<br />\ndunghter, won<br />\nThis grace, this stature, and this<br />\nfame.<br />\nIn speaking of the tasks which<br />\nfaced the small original faculty, Gilman remarked:<br />\n\"When I die, the memory of those<br />\nanxieties and perplexities will forever disappear.
