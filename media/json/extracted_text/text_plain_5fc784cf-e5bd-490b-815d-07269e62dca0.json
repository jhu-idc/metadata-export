In his opening remarks, however,<br />\nPresident Gordon did give an indication of how<br />\nHealth, Education and Welfare Secretary, Robert Finch<br />\nclosely the modern university is tied to the<br />\nnation's political directions.<br />\nproblems. \"It is partly a reaction to Viet Nam,\"<br />\nUsed To Contribute<br />\nhe said, although he denied that the answer<br />\n\"The reason that Mr. Finch was not award- lay<br />\nin ignoring everything outside our own bored an honorary degree,\" the President explained,<br />\nders.

The<br />\nurban university generally finds itself in the<br />\nmidst of this group, one which is growing and<br />\nwhich has ever-rising expectations.\"<br />\n\"The university is forced to be an employer, a landlord, and a teacher, and is thought of<br />\nby its students as mother, cop, and governmental<br />\nauthority. All this is compounded by the fact<br />\nthat it tends to be white in a non-white neighborhood.\"<br />\n\"New Arrangements\"<br />\nFinch emphasized that \"new institutional<br />\narrangements\" would have to be made soon if<br />\ninternal harmony is to be attained. \"How do we<br />\nget more doctors and more secondary school<br />\nteachers?

We should be exporting, not<br />\nimporting, doctors.\"<br />\nFinch summed up by explaining the in-<br />\n<br />\nDr. Kenneth Clark, Professor of psychology at CCNY<br />\n<br />\nherent duality of the university's position. \"We<br />\nask so much of the modern university\u2014that it<br />\nserve government, business, the community, the<br />\nindividual and many others\u2014that there is an unavoidable tension between the necessary degree<br />\nof isolation and the forced amount of participation.\"<br />\nEarlier in the afternoon, eleven new members were inducted into the University's twoyear-old Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars.<br />\nThe society, the only one of its kind in the<br />\nnation, inducts former postdoctoral fellows at<br />\nHopkins who have gained marked distinction in<br />\ntheir fields.<br />\nThe S.C.-sponsored demonstration which<br />\ntook place outside as the proceedings began,<br />\ncentered around a petition- drive which demanded that the General Assembly join with the students in establishing a new representative governing body for the Homewood campus.

TEUFELSDROCKH<br />\nThere has been a lot of shit flying around lately to the<br />\neffect that the Maryland House of Delegates (God Bless<br />\nThem)is all set to legalize dope,or at least really reduce<br />\nthe penalties, or something good anyway. What a fine<br />\ndaydream. Smoking dope with impunity, leering smugly .<br />\nas you blow smoke at the man, etc., etc.<br />\nAnd, unlike most of the wishful-thinking rumors that<br />\ngo around, this one even has a vague foundation in reality.<br />\nPretty vague, though. After a very hot summer (30 and<br />\n40 busts a month), there has been a noticeable decrease<br />\nIn cannabis busts. The logical imputation is correct - Mandel, after making his point, has ordered the Baltimore<br />\nPolice (who are under his direct control,not the Mayor's)<br />\nsuspend grass and hash raiding.(That,by the way, does not<br />\nmean that if you get caught holding by accident you're off<br />\nthe hook. You're busted.) A local political personality<br />\neven asserted that Mandel is surreptitiously backing the<br />\nliberals on the issue in Annapolis.<br />\nAnd here's the scoop-dope actually is an issue in Annapolis. Not much of an issue, to be sure. The opposition<br />\nis just about sure to blast it somewhere up into the<br />\n1990's.<br />\nJust for the record, though, there are three bills prefiled for the 1970 session of the General Assembly. The<br />\nmost tepid of all is the usual deal about how more research<br />\nshould be done on the subject.(sounds like one of those<br />\ncautious editorials in Time, yes?) To this end, Delegate<br />\nJacobson is the sponsor of a bill \"to request that the State<br />\ncooperate with the Federal Government in the funding and<br />\ndevelopment of research programs concerning marijuana<br />\nand hashish.\" Very big deal.<br />\nOne guy, Sen. Stone by name, wants to give methadone<br />\nto smackheads. A more promising bill, filed by Senator<br />\nBishop, provides that under certain circumstances, a<br />\n<br />\nEdward J. Bagley, State Senator from Prince Georges County.<br />\njudge may exercise the option to reduce the charge to a<br />\nmisdemeanor.(Now, it's a felony, with a mandatory sentence).<br />\nThe most radical bill of all, and oddly enough, the one<br />\nwith the best chance of getting passed, was prefiled in<br />\nDecember by one Del. Edward J. Bagley(D.,Prince Geo-<br />\n<br />\nrge's County). Seems Prince George's (a more-thanaverage wealthy suburb of Washington) was getting a little<br />\nuptight about all these nicemiddleclass kids getting shafted. Charity starts in the home.The bill provides that \"the<br />\npossession and use of marihuana shall be a misdemeanor...<br />\n(and) providing penalties therefore.\" The penalties,I was<br />\ninformed, were $250 and/or 6 months for first offenders,<br />\nand double penalties for subsequent offenders.<br />\nOn the whole, not a bad deal. For the time being, anyhow. And the best thing is that Bagley's bill has support<br />\nIn the General Assembly. Maybe, even the Governor's.<br />\nOutasight! Utopia dawning.<br />\nDon't believe it for a minute. That bill is going to get<br />\nstomped, like a cockroach. The atmosphere in the Assembly is about as paranoid as it can get. One Delegate<br />\nGerald J. Curran, reportedly made a speech against a<br />\nbill to lower the age at which one may sell his blood<br />\nwithout parental consent from 21 to 18, asserting that<br />\nyoung people would use the money to buy illegal drugs.<br />\nThe bill to lower the voting age will probably get fewer<br />\nvotes this year than last. A State Senator, who asked to<br />\nremain unnamed, said in an interview, \"The attitude<br />\nof my colleagues in the Legislature is appaling....they're<br />\nIgnorant - they don't know what the kids are trying to tell<br />\nthem. They talk to old people mostly, and old people are<br />\ntired of demonstrations. Some crazy amendments are being tacked on (to other bills) - like hang 'em in public.\"<br />\nDepressing, isn't it? I mean, everyone knows that<br />\nsooner or later, the government is going to have to accept<br />\na few of the realities of the situation. But everyone also<br />\nknows that the government has to be pushed pretty hard<br />\nbefore it gets down to business. So far, nobody seems to<br />\nhave done too much pushing.(Forgive the pun, it wasn't<br />\nintended) The other thing is, of course,that the Assembly<br />\nis populated largely by fossils. Don't worry,though,they'll<br />\nall be gone probably within thirty years or so.<br />\n<br />\nArab, Israeli Diplomats Come<br />\nSeparately to Discuss Middle East<br />\nThe Jordanian and Israeli ambassadors to the United<br />\nStates and a high-ranking State Department official will<br />\ntake part in a lecture series on the Middle East at The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nThe first program will feature Abdul Hamid Sharaf,<br />\nambassador of Jordan to the United States, who will speak<br />\nWednesday at 4 p.m. in Shriver Hall on the University's<br />\nHomewood Campus.

CRAMER<br />\nThe spring semester has seen Hopkins successfully take its first tentative<br />\nsteps toward establishing a full-fledged<br />\nprogram in urban studies.<br />\nFive Hopkins undergraduates, joined<br />\nby five Morgan State students, and taught<br />\nby four faculty members from Morgan,<br />\nHopkins and Maryland University Law<br />\nSchool, are receiving seven and onehalf credits for the semester in Urban<br />\nStudies.<br />\nThe program features a work-study<br />\narrangement whereby students work for<br />\ntwenty hours per week in a city governmental or service agency, and also attend a seminar for three hours on Tuesday nights.<br />\nThe seminar is held in the home of<br />\nEugene Feinblatt. Co-Director of thp<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Urban Affairs Center, located<br />\nIn the School of Hygiene. Together with<br />\nDr. Sol Levine, the Center's other Director; Dr. Robert Crain, Professor of<br />\nSocial Relations at Homewood; Perrin<br />\nMitchell, a professor at Morgan State;<br />\nand a Professor of Law from the University of Maryland, Feinblatt attempts<br />\nto provide discussion and readings which<br />\nwill complement the students' experiences at their jobs.<br />\n<br />\nAssembly, or \"see how well Baltimore<br />\nhas done for the year.\"<br />\nHis observation consists of attendance<br />\nat meetings, planning sessions and political caucuses. The Mayor's Task Force.<br />\nin Annapolis tries to promote the interests of the Baltimore Metropolitan<br />\narea among members of the General Assembly.<br />\n<br />\n\"High Calibre\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Learned a Lot\"<br />\n<br />\nJim Archibald, who is aiding in a study<br />\nof housing in the Baltimore area, also<br />\nfeels that the program has been rewarding. He, like most of the other participants stated that there was a balance<br />\nin the benefits derived by the students<br />\nand the agences they work for.<br />\nArchibald stated that the city received<br />\n\"fairly high calibre\" work from the students at no cost. The students, he said,<br />\ngained valuable experience which they<br />\nmight not obtain otherwise.<br />\nThe program to which Archibald is<br />\ncontributing is administed by the Neighborhood Development Division of the<br />\nDepartment of Housing and Community<br />\nDevelopment of Baltimore City. Archibald and his co-worker are sampling<br />\nfive to ten percent of the blocks in each<br />\nof the city's forty housing districts. Among the ten questions which the survey<br />\nwill answer are: the materials from<br />\nwhich the houses are constructed, the<br />\nnumber of vacant houses on each block,<br />\nthe size of the lots, etc. If the study is<br />\nsuccessful, city housing inspectors will<br />\nknow which districts require _closer or<br />\nmore frequent inspection.<br />\nSteve Kelsey is working with an agency<br />\nconcerned with coordinating governmental action within the metropolitan area.<br />\nBarry Rosen is engaged in a \"costbenefit\" analysis for the Upton Project<br />\nin the Baltimore Urban renewal project.<br />\n<br />\nThe five Hopkins undergraduates participating in the program are Jim Archibald, Ken Jones, John Blumenthal,Steve<br />\nKelsey and Barry Rosen.<br />\nThe program is entitled the Mayor's.<br />\nFellowship Program. The students receive no salaries for their work with<br />\nthe agencies. Their seven and one-half<br />\ncredits are awarded on a pass-fail basis.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Apathy<br />\nSlows Conduct<br />\nProtest Effort<br />\n<br />\nAll of the students contacted felt that<br />\nthey had learned a great deal from their<br />\nexperiences in the agencies. Ken Jones,<br />\na junior who has been working with the<br />\nMayor's commission for laison to the<br />\nMaryland General Assembly said,\"Certainly I've learned a lot...mostly, I've<br />\nenjoyed it tremendously.\"<br />\nJones spends twenty hours per week<br />\nin Annapolis in what he terms \"a combination of participation and observation.\" His participation, at this point,<br />\ncenters around the files which he keeps,<br />\non every bill in the legislature which is<br />\nof interest to Baltimore City. At the<br />\nend of the session, Jones will try to<br />\ncheck the city's record in the General<br />\n<br />\nStudent apathy is facing the organizers of the anti-Gordon Discipline Code<br />\npetition now in their third week of canvassing.<br />\nJim Cleary, organizer of the undergraduate petition, said that he had \"no<br />\nidea\" if his group can garner enough<br />\nstudent signatures to fulfil the 25% quota<br />\nrequested by President Gordon. So far,<br />\na few hundred students have signed the<br />\nPetition out of the 2,000 undergraduates<br />\non campus. The petition will be sent to<br />\nthe President in the next few weeks.<br />\nCleary stated that their main handicap<br />\nhas been general disinterest in the Discipline Code. \"Guys aren't taking any<br />\nPosition at all,\" Cleary asserted.\"Most<br />\nof them haven't read either Gordon's,<br />\nthe Student Affairs Committees' reports<br />\nor the News-Letter's account of the discipline issue.\"<br />\n<br />\nBlumenthal Pissed<br />\n<br />\n\"Couldn't Care Less\"<br />\nThe President of the Graduate Student<br />\nOrganization, Bob Cotter, said that the<br />\ngraduate anti-Gordon petition is going<br />\nvery slowly. \"We're just getting started,\" Cotter noted, \"but already we have<br />\nfound that a lot of graduates couldn't<br />\ncare less about the subject.\"<br />\nHowever, Cotter observed that the<br />\nGrad Organization is not trying to get<br />\n25% of their constituents to sign. \"We<br />\nare not doing this (petition) for Gordon<br />\nto consider. We are demanding that Gordon remove his document, that it was<br />\nillegitimate from the start for Gordon<br />\nto overrule the Student Affairs discipline report.\"<br />\nTo this Cleary asked, \"Gordon has<br />\nthe power. How can we demand anything?\"<br />\n<br />\nDr. Robert Crain of the Department of<br />\nSocial Relations is one of the instructors<br />\nin the Urban Studies Seminar.<br />\n<br />\nThe only student who seemed less<br />\nthan entirely satisfied with the program was John Blumenthal. His work,<br />\nuntil this week, had consisted of comparing assessments of property with<br />\ntheir actual price when sold on the<br />\nmarket. Blumenthal was going to work<br />\non an area-wide survey of this type for<br />\nthe Housing and Community Development Agency.<br />\nHe opted to change jobs in midstream, however, when he learned that<br />\nthe city planned to make such a survey city-wide. \"My work would have<br />\nbeen redundant,\" he sighed.<br />\nOne other complaint was voiced by<br />\nJones, who stated that the students<br />\ndeserved \"either marks or more credit\" for their work in Urban Affairs.<br />\nJones, who also holds another job, said<br />\nhe finds it difficult to keep the schedule<br />\nwhich his work requires.<br />\n<br />\nEat-in, Carry-out<br />\n<br />\nThis discussion at the Tuesday seminars center mainly on the students' experiences on their jobs. The five students from Morgan State have only attended the seminar once.

During the telephone<br />\nconversation, according to Cramer,Blumenthal gave no indication that he was<br />\nother than mildly annoyed. As he entered the office, Blumenthal insisted that<br />\nhe had thought it was 8:00 a.m. This<br />\nseemed to annoy him most of all.<br />\nGeorge Klopfer, who was present throughout the episode, considered Blumenthal's actions unexplainable. \"It looked<br />\npretty dark for eight o'clock in the morning,\" Klopfer opined.

Despite much law-and-order bantering on the<br />\npart of concerned local officials, the state has not complied, nor made any concete effort in the direction of<br />\ncompliance.<br />\nThe original order came down from the civil rights<br />\ndivision of HEW, which warned that non-compliance<br />\nwould result in a loss of federal funds. Despite non-compliance, there has been no such loss. At the time of the<br />\norder\u2014until last - week\u2014the civil rights (i.e. enforcement)<br />\ndivision was headed by Mr. Leon Panetta. Last week, the<br />\nWhite House resigned Mr.Panetta, who was regarded as too<br />\nzealous for middle America on civil rights.<br />\nPanetta was reportedly the pawn in the latest of the<br />\nnever-ending series of Nixon-Finch power struggles, which<br />\nNixon invariably wins. This time Agnew had the gripe<br />\nfrom the White House side. It seemed to Agnew that<br />\nPanetta had diabolical plans to destroy white collegiate<br />\nsanctuaries in Agnew's own back yard, and possibly risk<br />\nexacerbating tensions by mixing the races.<br />\n\u2022Despite recent Supreme Court rulings calling for immediate integration wherever segregation or de facto segregation is found, Maryland colleges\u2014for that matter, Maryland<br />\nhigh schools--remain as they were a year ago, predominantly one-race institutions. The University of Maryland at<br />\nCollege Park, for example, was and is 99 per cent white.<br />\nIts Princess Anne County campus is 92 per cent black. And<br />\nso on down the line.<br />\nTo improve racial balance, the state college Board of<br />\nTrustees commissioned a $12,000 study of the problem,<br />\nand asked the administration of each college to submit its<br />\nown recommendations. The oursider can only assume that<br />\nthese reports have been carefully scrutinized\u2014for they<br />\nwere doubtless all in the bureaucratic verbiage that warrants scrutinization without regard to content \u2014and tossed<br />\naway, along with Mr. Panetta.<br />\nThe original deadline for submission of a desegregation<br />\nplan was set for last July. But'the summer, fall, and most<br />\nof the winter have passed without incident, as Maryland<br />\n- has still not submitted a plan and Nixonian officials have<br />\ndeclined to take public notice. Panetta became an exNixonian official precisely because he was no longer<br />\ndeemed trustworthy to remain silent while the law was<br />\nsystematically abused by government officials entrusted<br />\nwith its enforcement.<br />\nIsn't it nice having a Vice-President from Maryland?<br />\n<br />\nBy WILLIAM BENZON<br />\nAs Michael Brenson so astutely pointed out in<br />\nthis Journal awhile back, the myth of America has<br />\nbeen revealed for the lie it is: America is bareassed, not only before the world, but before herself. I would like to add a footnote or two to Mr.<br />\nBrenson's article.<br />\nAs the myth disintegrates the chief characteristic of our methods of decision making will become exposed: the reasons which inform our debate have little to do with the factors which impell the decision. This in part due to the nature<br />\nof institutional decision making; individuals efface<br />\ntheir personal identity, their very being, so that<br />\nthey might take a proper institutional role (example: a high administrative official in a wellknown Baltimore university who has no opinions<br />\nbecause he is a high administrative official.)<br />\nThis leads to total loss of moral responsibility<br />\n(examples: Dachau, the \"Presidio stockade, Song<br />\nMy); in another context the phrase \"psychological<br />\naddiction\" is used. But then,the institutions where<br />\ncreated by men and men have always been avoiding responsibility.<br />\n<br />\nTwo Are One<br />\nMake no mistakes; most of the people in this<br />\ncountry know (they even know it is they who are<br />\nresponsible--but they palm it off on...), who is<br />\nresponsible for this mess and they know it is a<br />\nmess. But then one has to believe in something and,<br />\nin the absence of any but the most senile of gods,<br />\none believes in one's country. The country in<br />\nwhich the patriot believes exists in a different<br />\nuniverse of discourse from the country in which<br />\nhe earns his bread and is nagged to buy buy buy!<br />\nIt hasn't yet occurred to him that the two are in<br />\nfact one.<br />\n-But as the myth dies he will be forced to see<br />\nthat the two are indeed one. Herein lies a great<br />\nhope and a great despair.Whatwill the reaction to<br />\ntruth be?<br />\n<br />\nEternal Dilemna<br />\n<br />\nDifferences Trivial<br />\nA local example of this split can be seen in the<br />\nabove mentioned Baltimore university. A number<br />\nof students, faculty ,and administrators decided<br />\nthat a student disciplinary code was needed.<br />\nThere are now two versions of such a code; one<br />\nversion prepared by an advisory committee and<br />\none prepared by the above mentioned high administrative official. The differences between the<br />\ntwo versions are trivial if one believes that a student discipline code is imperative and so there<br />\nshould be little difficulty involved in adopting one<br />\nversion or the other. But there is much quibbling<br />\nand many reasonings; and the real issue is: who<br />\nruns the university, the high administrative official or the students and faculty?<br />\nBut neither side can openly acknowledge, in<br />\nthis particular context, what the issue is (though<br />\nin private the students and faculty distrust and<br />\nresent this official and this official has complementary feelings), for then both sides would be<br />\nexposed, left naked. And the winter air is cold.<br />\nSo the quibble will continue behind it's schizophrenic screen.<br />\n<br />\nThe dilemma is not new, it is much more than<br />\nvery old. It is eternal. \"And they heard the sound<br />\nof the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool<br />\nof the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the<br />\ntrees of the garden. But the Lord God called to the<br />\nman, and said to him, 'Where are you?' And he<br />\nsaid, 'I heard the sound of thee in the garden,<br />\nand I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid<br />\nmyself.\" And the man blamed it on the woman,<br />\nthe woman blamed it on the serpent; the serpent<br />\nwas Satan and Satan blamed it on the Lord God.<br />\n(Only in comparison with being is non-being nothing.)<br />\nThe great hope lies in seeing the truth, accepting it and repenting Of past evil (which means to<br />\nacknowledge one's sin, but to do better in the future rather than using guilt for past sins as an<br />\nexcuse for doing nothing, don't look back). Given<br />\nthis, then;<br />\n...much more good thereof shall spring,<br />\nTo God more glory, more good will to Men<br />\nFrom God, and over wrath grace shall abound.<br />\n<br />\nGreedy Watchdog<br />\nComing Apart<br />\nSimilarly, the legal status of marijuana has<br />\nnothing to do with the merits or demerits of the<br />\ndrug; though that is the excuse which informs debate on the subject. The issue is political and social; hedonism vs. a perverted puritanism, young<br />\nvs. old, liberals and radicals vs. silent majority.<br />\nLikewise the ABM. The issue was not whether or<br />\nnot the ABM could possibly work or evenwhether<br />\nor not the arms race is something any sane man<br />\ncould believe in. Rather the issue was: do we throw<br />\nthat obscenely greedy watchdog another fillet or<br />\nmust he content himself with a bone? He was thrown<br />\na fillet, thus establishing that the master is still<br />\nafraid of his watchdog.<br />\nAnd Vietnam is filled with the corpses and<br />\npoisoned land engendered by this mismarriage of<br />\nreason and fear. Why are we there?\"Because they<br />\nasked us there, we gotta keep the world free for<br />\ndemocracy and we gotta save face.\" No! We're<br />\nthere because the makers of our foreign policy<br />\nare bumbling incompetents, because of the flaming xenophobia of the silent majority, because that<br />\nwatchdog likes his fillet and he has lots of friends<br />\nwho like to bury bones for the sake of burying<br />\nbones (they got big piles of them good bones!)<br />\nand because the sun shall never set on the Amurrican empire.<br />\nWe all know this and we have always known it;<br />\nbut we have never beenforced to admit it in public<br />\n(not even in the anonymity of a Gallup poll--who's<br />\nto say everyone really believes what he tells the<br />\nTHE WIZARD OF ID<br />\n<br />\nM it7Ni6HT!<br />\nMUT ARE<br />\nCt2IN&<br />\n<br />\nDOWN<br />\nTHERE<br />\n<br />\n1-13<br />\n<br />\n416%<br />\n<br />\nTo face the truth is to regain some measure of<br />\ncontrol over the consequences of one's decisions<br />\nbecause one is no longer forced to believe a myth<br />\nwhich makes it impossible to affect the real sources of power. To face the truth is to change from a<br />\nsituation where reason exists only to give tangible<br />\nform and substance to a formless and endless need<br />\nfor power and control (eliminate all myths and<br />\nnothing is left but fear of the other and desire to<br />\ncontrol him) to a situation where power serves<br />\nto root abstract reason into the substance of the<br />\nearth so that flowers might bloom and flourish<br />\nrather than wilt and perish.<br />\n<br />\nTo turn from the truth is to invite chaos, and<br />\nthe great despair. For perhaps the truth is too<br />\nmuch to bear. In which case the myth is grasped<br />\neven more greedily; and the more greedily it is<br />\ngrasped, the more the life giving truth is choked<br />\noff; the more greedily the truth is choked off.<br />\nthe more greedily is the myth grasped. The<br />\nparasite destroys the host and thus destroys himself. The systems engineer would call it positive<br />\nfeedback. The logician calls it an infinite regress. For a plain speaking man it is a vacious<br />\ncircle. For the psychiatrist, schizophrenic disintegration. Sartre, the abyss.

I have had the opportunity to hear many<br />\ndifferent people expound on this \"Unique\" University<br />\nof.ours and also had the opportunity to hear the undergraduates complain vociferously about their problems.<br />\nIt seems like one of their biggest complaints is the fact<br />\nthat they (the undergraduates) feel as though they are<br />\ngetting short-changed in our \"Unique\" University. I<br />\nhave always been very empathetic about their criticism<br />\nbecause I, too, felt that the athletic department and<br />\nthe people involved in the programs centered at the<br />\nAthletic Center were also being `short-changed'.<br />\nI am finding, to my dismay, that one of the unique<br />\nqualities of this institution is that the undergraduates,<br />\nas exemplified by your article, are more than willing<br />\nto criticize any effort or attempt by their fellow students to achieve a certain amount of self satisfaction<br />\nand pride out of their involvement in athletics. This<br />\nwillingness to criticize is further reinforced by a strong<br />\ndesire on the part of the undergraduates not to get involved himself.<br />\nThey say, en masse, 'give us control of the University, give us more Professors and less graduate instructors, give us a Student Center, give us everything, but<br />\ndon't ask us to stand up and be counted. Don't ask us to<br />\nget involved, don't ask us to work in the inner city,<br />\nmental hospitals, athletic teams, school papers, or<br />\ncommittees. We don't want to make a constructive effort<br />\ntoward helping to solve the problems of our times, but<br />\ngive me a chance to sit back and criticise the few that<br />\nare.'<br />\n<br />\nSo we run a \"bush\" Fall Sports Banquet for 75 young<br />\nmen that gave something to Hopkins. They sure as Hell<br />\ndidn't play in front of large crowds, and they didn't get<br />\ntheir names in the Baltimore Sun very often and when<br />\nthey did lose games because they aren't 'professionals' they most definitely did get criticized by their<br />\nfellow students both in and out of the News-:Letter.<br />\nMaybe it was 'dull' to you, but I appreciated the fact<br />\nthat George Hayward gave his time to see all of our<br />\nand try to feel as if he were<br />\nlast fall<br />\ngames<br />\nassociated with a fine group of young men. I also<br />\nappreciated the fact that Vince Bagli was willing to<br />\ncome over to Hopkins and say 'Hello' to us for a roast<br />\nbeef dinner and the reason he was late was because<br />\nhe had to do a T.V. show. I also appreciated the fact<br />\nthat President Gordon attended along with Ross Jones,<br />\nDave Kaufman, Oz Steinwald, Bob Hewes. I also appreciated the fact that we can't go 1st class in the Banquet<br />\nbecause Hopkins just doesn't have the funds. Denny Cox<br />\nbrought his wife to the Banquet because he believed in<br />\nthe young men that were being honored that night. Denny<br />\nhad to pay for his wife's dinner just like the rest of the<br />\ncoaches that brought their wives and you know that Denny<br />\ndid for Hopkins last fall? He worked as an integral part<br />\nof our staff and didn't get a penny for his service.<br />\nI also realized, and would have been happy to tell you<br />\nif you asked, that the reason why the banquet was the<br />\nfourth of February is because many finals were given<br />\nduring the early part of December and the Captains requested that we postpone the banquet feeling a need to<br />\nstudy and try to catch upwith their classmates that spend<br />\nSaturday afternoons during the fall in the library. If you<br />\nconsult your calendar you will find that with registration<br />\nand the beginning of classes this is the earliest we could<br />\n<br />\nhave had the banquet. Remember George, your classmates were away for a few weeks on 'independent<br />\nresearch' at Stow, Vermont, Bahamas, and some other<br />\nintellectual resorts.<br />\nI don't think our banquet was 'bush'. I think you and<br />\nthe others that sit on the sidelines of all the games of<br />\nlife criticizing and unwilling to give of themselves are<br />\n'bush'.<br />\nThe true 'uniqueness' of this University is the 'fact<br />\nthat it allows the best and worst to come to the surface.<br />\nThank god we have the Russ Passarellas, Paul Aliens,<br />\nJoe Cowans, Charlie Cokers, Bob Hydes and even<br />\nthough he will never believe this the Rich .Convisers.<br />\nThe people that are willing to get involved, the people<br />\nthat are willing to 'stand up and be counted' the people<br />\nthat are willing to get in the arena of life and either 'put<br />\nup or shut up'.<br />\nWhy don't you start a campaign on campus to be positive - instead of negative. I assure you our football<br />\nprogram will survive your criticisms and complaints,<br />\nbut it would be so nice to think that someone was actually<br />\npulling for us to do well and truthfully care when we<br />\ndidn't. I have tried as a football coach and I know<br />\nour players have tried their best. Why don't you and<br />\nyour other cynics try to make a concerted effort to help<br />\nus build together toward a better University rather than<br />\nsit around criticizing the small measure of success we<br />\nhave achieved.<br />\nI assure you I would look forward to and welcome the<br />\nopportunity to work with you to make this fine University a better one.<br />\n<br />\nAlexander Sour<br />\nHead Football Coach<br />\n<br />\nKingdom and the Bowling Alley<br />\nBy JIMMY OLSENBERG<br />\nI was young then, still a freshman at<br />\ncollege, and I was in New York making<br />\nthe rounds for a newspaper job. I went<br />\nfirst, of course, to the New York Times,<br />\nor, as I had come to call it, My Bible.<br />\nAs I entered the building, I felt like<br />\nan aged, devout Moslem entering the holy<br />\ngates of Mecca.<br />\nInside, everyone seemed to have slightly graying, razor-cut hair that modishly<br />\ncame down over the collars of their<br />\nVan Ileusen shirts. Dressed in expensive, tailor-made pin stripe suits, they<br />\nchatted casually about yachting and polo,<br />\nand their tanned faced glowed with selfassurance. They had all graduated from<br />\nHarvard or the Columbia School of Journalism, or both.<br />\nUnfortunately, I was unable to get a job<br />\nat the Times, and with a shaky conscience, I took the cross-town bus to the<br />\nNews.<br />\n<br />\nLet's Crack Down!<br />\nNow, as a card-carrying Jewish liberal, I had always looked down on the<br />\nDaily News. I even used to cut out their<br />\neditorials and post them on my bulletin<br />\nboard, in order to impress girls with<br />\nmy wildly original,off-beat humor.Their<br />\nanti-dissent editorials usually went like<br />\nthis:<br />\nIt's high time that all these bleedingheart kooks and liberals quit their yapping about \"police brutality.\" These<br />\nCommie dupes will go to no end in their<br />\nKremlin-hatched smear job on the policemen of this nation. Along with the<br />\nsofties on the Supreme Court, these<br />\nlong-haired weirdoes are trying to handcuff the polico, while anarchists and<br />\ncriminals are running wild on the streets.<br />\nWe say let's put an end to all this hot<br />\nair on \"criminal's rights,\" and start<br />\nthinking about the rights of the lawabiding citizens of the nation. The only<br />\nthing a criminal understands is a good<br />\nknock on the head, and pronto!<br />\n<br />\nThe Late Show<br />\nAs I entered the city room of the News,<br />\nI rubbed my eyes in disbelief. The Daily<br />\nNews was actually nothing more than a<br />\nre-creation of all the movies on newspapers that I had watched on the Late<br />\nShow. Everywhere I looked, old men in<br />\nsuspenders, with their ties loosened,and<br />\ngreen, visors shading their eyes, were<br />\nbeneover ancient black typewriters,fur-<br />\n<br />\niously pounding away. Elsewhere, reporters were making phone calls as they<br />\nnervously<br />\nsmoked<br />\ncigarettes. Any<br />\nminute I expected Spencer Tracy or Humphrey Bogart to come in with the latest<br />\nscoop. I had always imagined that the<br />\npeople who turned outthe copy must surely be a group of well-educated practical<br />\njokers, turning out their drivel to mock<br />\nthe sub-literate masses who so eagerly<br />\ngobbled it up.<br />\nThis was not the case. The reporters<br />\nwho told those millions of readers about<br />\nsexpot scandals and mad rapists were<br />\nreally not that much different from their<br />\nreaders.<br />\n<br />\nScrew<br />\nBut what was even more amazing to<br />\nme was the lack of status accorded even<br />\nthe most illustrious editors. As I was<br />\nshown around the city room,occasionally<br />\nstopping to pick up a beer can that blocked my path, the personnel director pointed out various celebrities. \"That's the<br />\ncity editor,\" he said, pointing to a wizened, wrinkled old man in suspenders<br />\nwho sat at the head of a large table ogling<br />\nthe latest copy of Screw magazine.<br />\n\"Hey\", the old man exclaimed, \"take a<br />\nlook at that pussy!\" The others at the<br />\ntable looked up, and one aging man lumbered over to take a look for himself.<br />\nThe city editor spread out the photo of a<br />\nhefty brunette model lifting her skirt.<br />\nWe moved on to the other large desks,<br />\nand as he pointed out each one of the<br />\nvarious prominent people, I realized that<br />\nthere was very little glamour about them.<br />\nIn the Times, men in the same position<br />\nwould have 'the fabulous aura of demigods. Here, however, they were just<br />\nmen doing their jobs. They sat at<br />\ntheir desks like everybody else, and<br />\nthey were not separated behind heavy<br />\noak doors with gold letters on the outside. As I soon realized, although the<br />\nNews may be more strident in its trumpetings against threats to the American<br />\nWay of Life, it was e4remely tolerant<br />\nwithin the bureaucratic structure.<br />\nThe copyboys were almost all longhaired, except the black copyboys, who<br />\nwere decked out in Afros, dashikis,<br />\nbeads, or daz4ling silk shirts. On<br />\nweekends, reporters and copy editors<br />\nwould come in T-shirts, blue jeans,<br />\nand bermuda shorts. The younger reporters were liberals, as were most of<br />\nthe guys on the telegraph desk, and they<br />\nhad a bemused attitude towards the<br />\n<br />\nrantings in the editorial page.<br />\nEditorial policy was not democratically decided, but rather hatched from<br />\ntwo cubicles stuck in the Women's Department. There, forty-year veterans<br />\nlike Reuben Maury typed out their mutterings on pinko faggots. Reuben was<br />\na small, bent-over man, with suspenders, walking cane, and a straw hat.<br />\nWhen I would have to deliver a message to him, I'd enter his little room<br />\nonly to see him cackling over his editorials. He was occasionally seen at<br />\nvarious parts of the city room, hurriedly moving towards some destination<br />\nknown only to him, with a frozen grin<br />\non his face. His movements were quick<br />\nand jerky, like a toy puppet's. Once<br />\n<br />\na day, he would emerge from his office<br />\nin the 19th century, shuffle towards the<br />\ntelegraph desk, deposit his editorial,<br />\nwheel around, and head back to his<br />\nworld of Commies and hippies and rabble-rousers in the Women's Department.<br />\nMeanwhile, the young editor<br />\nwho had just received this latest editorial would glance at the copy, and<br />\nthen shake his head in disbelief. When<br />\nhe'd come into the city room, I would<br />\nalways wonder what must go through<br />\npoor Reuben's mind after he sees the<br />\ncopyboys dressed conspicuously like the<br />\nanarchists and Black Power fanatics he<br />\nhad just decried in his editorial.<br />\n(Part II of this article will appear in the<br />\nnext edition of the News-Letter).<br />\n<br />\nKeen, Torns of Pain<br />\nBy JAMES FEE MARTIN<br />\nOne more step in the increasing attempt to explore the previously overlooked darker side of an allegedly narrow and prudish Victorian morality has<br />\nbeen taken with the publication of LoveLyrics, hitherto surpressed private(and<br />\nrevealing) musings by that much-under*rated stylist James Whitcomb Riley, the<br />\nso-called \"Hoosier Poet.\"<br />\nLong known as the author of many<br />\nvolumes of children's poetry, and such<br />\nfolk.classics as \"When the Frost Is on<br />\nthe Pumpkin,\" Riley now reveals another aspect of his character as a tireless celebrator of the infinite variety<br />\nand sensual exaltation of the act of<br />\nphysical love.<br />\nFrom his precocious introduction to<br />\nthe paths of pleasure described in \"A<br />\nVery Youthful Affair,\" through the sheer<br />\nphysical immediacy of the memories in<br />\nLeonanie and Judith, (\"All forebodings<br />\nthat distressed me/I forgot as Joy caressed me...the soft touch of her hand/<br />\ntakes all breath....\" the author gives<br />\ncontinual insights into the state of Eros<br />\nin this country during the latter part<br />\nof the Nineteenth Century.<br />\nThe sadistic tendencies of the Victorian man have been the subject of<br />\nmany works, but rarely have we been<br />\ngiven the opportunity to view the corresponding trend towards masochism<br />\nwhich Riley approaches in such poems<br />\nas A Variation. Beginning with the invitation to \"Hate me just a little-come!\" he expresses the dual nature of<br />\nthe desire to at once inflict and re-<br />\n<br />\nlines like \"Make your<br />\nceive pain in<br />\nsobbing lips unsheathe/ All the glitter<br />\nof your teeth!\", the wish to destroy,<br />\n\"How I hate the torrid/ Touches of<br />\nyour splendid lips...\" and simultaneously to be overwhelmed - \"Now before me looms Something more than<br />\nhuman...Something to bow down before/<br />\nReverently and adore.\"<br />\nTurning from these deep probings into the dark heart of human desire, Riley<br />\noffers an apologetic for his actions in<br />\nHow It Happened, attempting to spread<br />\nhis hedonistic gospel among his more<br />\nrepressed contemporaries.<br />\nIn his last poems, one senses a certain weariness with the never-ceasing<br />\ndrive of depravity, \"...every briered/<br />\nWith keener thorns of pain....\", until<br />\nfinally, in Blooms of May, he cries<br />\n\"No more for me... \"No more - No<br />\nmore -\"<br />\nBut the joys of the flesh are never<br />\ncompletely lost, and When Age Comes<br />\nOn recalls once more the \"tide of raptures, long withdrawn,\" flowing back<br />\nin \"summer-floods\".<br />\nIn their outstanding edition of these<br />\nworks,<br />\nBobbs-Merrill has combined<br />\nthe poems with another long-hidden work<br />\nof genius from the same pried, the<br />\n\"Life Pictures\" of photographer William<br />\nB. Dyer. Evocative at once of age-old<br />\ndesires and the particular idiosyncracies of the age which produced them,<br />\nthese masterpieces of lecherous imagination run wild are the perfect companions for<br />\nRiley's sinuous inner<br />\nthoughts.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 6<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jay Swimmers Dunk Franklin - Marshall<br />\nbaturday afternoon, the varsity swim team added a second<br />\nvictory in one week to their credit by beating Franklin and Marshall, 74 to 21.

After the editorial went to<br />\npress, but before it appeared, word came from Bilgrave's office through a liaison that he would appreciate it if the News-Letter would cool down its attack on<br />\nthe admissions charges. For this favor assurancewas given that at the end of the<br />\n\"football\" season the entire policy would be reviewed.<br />\nThat was three months ago, and it is doubtful that the university has any intention of reviewing the policy until the end of the lacrosse season. This would be<br />\ntoo late for undergraduates to participate meaningfully in any decision making<br />\nbefore next year. Both the Fall and Winter season are now history except for postseason play. A review of the Admissions Policy is already one season late.

In his opening remarks, however,<br />\nPresident Gordon did give an indication of how<br />\nHealth, Education and Welfare Secretary, Robert Finch<br />\nclosely the modern university is tied to the<br />\nnation's political directions.<br />\nproblems. \"It is partly a reaction to Viet Nam,\"<br />\nUsed To Contribute<br />\nhe said, although he denied that the answer<br />\n\"The reason that Mr. Finch was not award- lay<br />\nin ignoring everything outside our own bored an honorary degree,\" the President explained,<br />\nders.

The<br />\nurban university generally finds itself in the<br />\nmidst of this group, one which is growing and<br />\nwhich has ever-rising expectations.\"<br />\n\"The university is forced to be an employer, a landlord, and a teacher, and is thought of<br />\nby its students as mother, cop, and governmental<br />\nauthority. All this is compounded by the fact<br />\nthat it tends to be white in a non-white neighborhood.\"<br />\n\"New Arrangements\"<br />\nFinch emphasized that \"new institutional<br />\narrangements\" would have to be made soon if<br />\ninternal harmony is to be attained. \"How do we<br />\nget more doctors and more secondary school<br />\nteachers?

We should be exporting, not<br />\nimporting, doctors.\"<br />\nFinch summed up by explaining the in-<br /><br />\nDr. Kenneth Clark, Professor of psychology at CCNY<br /><br />\nherent duality of the university's position. \"We<br />\nask so much of the modern university\u2014that it<br />\nserve government, business, the community, the<br />\nindividual and many others\u2014that there is an unavoidable tension between the necessary degree<br />\nof isolation and the forced amount of participation.\"<br />\nEarlier in the afternoon, eleven new members were inducted into the University's twoyear-old Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars.<br />\nThe society, the only one of its kind in the<br />\nnation, inducts former postdoctoral fellows at<br />\nHopkins who have gained marked distinction in<br />\ntheir fields.<br />\nThe S.C.-sponsored demonstration which<br />\ntook place outside as the proceedings began,<br />\ncentered around a petition- drive which demanded that the General Assembly join with the students in establishing a new representative governing body for the Homewood campus.

TEUFELSDROCKH<br />\nThere has been a lot of shit flying around lately to the<br />\neffect that the Maryland House of Delegates (God Bless<br />\nThem)is all set to legalize dope,or at least really reduce<br />\nthe penalties, or something good anyway. What a fine<br />\ndaydream. Smoking dope with impunity, leering smugly .<br />\nas you blow smoke at the man, etc., etc.<br />\nAnd, unlike most of the wishful-thinking rumors that<br />\ngo around, this one even has a vague foundation in reality.<br />\nPretty vague, though. After a very hot summer (30 and<br />\n40 busts a month), there has been a noticeable decrease<br />\nIn cannabis busts. The logical imputation is correct - Mandel, after making his point, has ordered the Baltimore<br />\nPolice (who are under his direct control,not the Mayor's)<br />\nsuspend grass and hash raiding.(That,by the way, does not<br />\nmean that if you get caught holding by accident you're off<br />\nthe hook. You're busted.) A local political personality<br />\neven asserted that Mandel is surreptitiously backing the<br />\nliberals on the issue in Annapolis.<br />\nAnd here's the scoop-dope actually is an issue in Annapolis. Not much of an issue, to be sure. The opposition<br />\nis just about sure to blast it somewhere up into the<br />\n1990's.<br />\nJust for the record, though, there are three bills prefiled for the 1970 session of the General Assembly. The<br />\nmost tepid of all is the usual deal about how more research<br />\nshould be done on the subject.(sounds like one of those<br />\ncautious editorials in Time, yes?) To this end, Delegate<br />\nJacobson is the sponsor of a bill \"to request that the State<br />\ncooperate with the Federal Government in the funding and<br />\ndevelopment of research programs concerning marijuana<br />\nand hashish.\" Very big deal.<br />\nOne guy, Sen. Stone by name, wants to give methadone<br />\nto smackheads. A more promising bill, filed by Senator<br />\nBishop, provides that under certain circumstances, a<br /><br />\nEdward J. Bagley, State Senator from Prince Georges County.<br />\njudge may exercise the option to reduce the charge to a<br />\nmisdemeanor.(Now, it's a felony, with a mandatory sentence).<br />\nThe most radical bill of all, and oddly enough, the one<br />\nwith the best chance of getting passed, was prefiled in<br />\nDecember by one Del. Edward J. Bagley(D.,Prince Geo-<br /><br />\nrge's County). Seems Prince George's (a more-thanaverage wealthy suburb of Washington) was getting a little<br />\nuptight about all these nicemiddleclass kids getting shafted. Charity starts in the home.The bill provides that \"the<br />\npossession and use of marihuana shall be a misdemeanor...<br />\n(and) providing penalties therefore.\" The penalties,I was<br />\ninformed, were $250 and/or 6 months for first offenders,<br />\nand double penalties for subsequent offenders.<br />\nOn the whole, not a bad deal. For the time being, anyhow. And the best thing is that Bagley's bill has support<br />\nIn the General Assembly. Maybe, even the Governor's.<br />\nOutasight! Utopia dawning.<br />\nDon't believe it for a minute. That bill is going to get<br />\nstomped, like a cockroach. The atmosphere in the Assembly is about as paranoid as it can get. One Delegate<br />\nGerald J. Curran, reportedly made a speech against a<br />\nbill to lower the age at which one may sell his blood<br />\nwithout parental consent from 21 to 18, asserting that<br />\nyoung people would use the money to buy illegal drugs.<br />\nThe bill to lower the voting age will probably get fewer<br />\nvotes this year than last. A State Senator, who asked to<br />\nremain unnamed, said in an interview, \"The attitude<br />\nof my colleagues in the Legislature is appaling....they're<br />\nIgnorant - they don't know what the kids are trying to tell<br />\nthem. They talk to old people mostly, and old people are<br />\ntired of demonstrations. Some crazy amendments are being tacked on (to other bills) - like hang 'em in public.\"<br />\nDepressing, isn't it? I mean, everyone knows that<br />\nsooner or later, the government is going to have to accept<br />\na few of the realities of the situation. But everyone also<br />\nknows that the government has to be pushed pretty hard<br />\nbefore it gets down to business. So far, nobody seems to<br />\nhave done too much pushing.(Forgive the pun, it wasn't<br />\nintended) The other thing is, of course,that the Assembly<br />\nis populated largely by fossils. Don't worry,though,they'll<br />\nall be gone probably within thirty years or so.<br /><br />\nArab, Israeli Diplomats Come<br />\nSeparately to Discuss Middle East<br />\nThe Jordanian and Israeli ambassadors to the United<br />\nStates and a high-ranking State Department official will<br />\ntake part in a lecture series on the Middle East at The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nThe first program will feature Abdul Hamid Sharaf,<br />\nambassador of Jordan to the United States, who will speak<br />\nWednesday at 4 p.m. in Shriver Hall on the University's<br />\nHomewood Campus.

CRAMER<br />\nThe spring semester has seen Hopkins successfully take its first tentative<br />\nsteps toward establishing a full-fledged<br />\nprogram in urban studies.<br />\nFive Hopkins undergraduates, joined<br />\nby five Morgan State students, and taught<br />\nby four faculty members from Morgan,<br />\nHopkins and Maryland University Law<br />\nSchool, are receiving seven and onehalf credits for the semester in Urban<br />\nStudies.<br />\nThe program features a work-study<br />\narrangement whereby students work for<br />\ntwenty hours per week in a city governmental or service agency, and also attend a seminar for three hours on Tuesday nights.<br />\nThe seminar is held in the home of<br />\nEugene Feinblatt. Co-Director of thp<br /><br />\nHopkins Urban Affairs Center, located<br />\nIn the School of Hygiene. Together with<br />\nDr. Sol Levine, the Center's other Director; Dr. Robert Crain, Professor of<br />\nSocial Relations at Homewood; Perrin<br />\nMitchell, a professor at Morgan State;<br />\nand a Professor of Law from the University of Maryland, Feinblatt attempts<br />\nto provide discussion and readings which<br />\nwill complement the students' experiences at their jobs.<br /><br />\nAssembly, or \"see how well Baltimore<br />\nhas done for the year.\"<br />\nHis observation consists of attendance<br />\nat meetings, planning sessions and political caucuses. The Mayor's Task Force.<br />\nin Annapolis tries to promote the interests of the Baltimore Metropolitan<br />\narea among members of the General Assembly.<br /><br />\n\"High Calibre\"<br /><br />\n\"Learned a Lot\"<br /><br />\nJim Archibald, who is aiding in a study<br />\nof housing in the Baltimore area, also<br />\nfeels that the program has been rewarding. He, like most of the other participants stated that there was a balance<br />\nin the benefits derived by the students<br />\nand the agences they work for.<br />\nArchibald stated that the city received<br />\n\"fairly high calibre\" work from the students at no cost. The students, he said,<br />\ngained valuable experience which they<br />\nmight not obtain otherwise.<br />\nThe program to which Archibald is<br />\ncontributing is administed by the Neighborhood Development Division of the<br />\nDepartment of Housing and Community<br />\nDevelopment of Baltimore City. Archibald and his co-worker are sampling<br />\nfive to ten percent of the blocks in each<br />\nof the city's forty housing districts. Among the ten questions which the survey<br />\nwill answer are: the materials from<br />\nwhich the houses are constructed, the<br />\nnumber of vacant houses on each block,<br />\nthe size of the lots, etc. If the study is<br />\nsuccessful, city housing inspectors will<br />\nknow which districts require _closer or<br />\nmore frequent inspection.<br />\nSteve Kelsey is working with an agency<br />\nconcerned with coordinating governmental action within the metropolitan area.<br />\nBarry Rosen is engaged in a \"costbenefit\" analysis for the Upton Project<br />\nin the Baltimore Urban renewal project.<br /><br />\nThe five Hopkins undergraduates participating in the program are Jim Archibald, Ken Jones, John Blumenthal,Steve<br />\nKelsey and Barry Rosen.<br />\nThe program is entitled the Mayor's.<br />\nFellowship Program. The students receive no salaries for their work with<br />\nthe agencies. Their seven and one-half<br />\ncredits are awarded on a pass-fail basis.<br /><br />\nStudent Apathy<br />\nSlows Conduct<br />\nProtest Effort<br /><br />\nAll of the students contacted felt that<br />\nthey had learned a great deal from their<br />\nexperiences in the agencies. Ken Jones,<br />\na junior who has been working with the<br />\nMayor's commission for laison to the<br />\nMaryland General Assembly said,\"Certainly I've learned a lot...mostly, I've<br />\nenjoyed it tremendously.\"<br />\nJones spends twenty hours per week<br />\nin Annapolis in what he terms \"a combination of participation and observation.\" His participation, at this point,<br />\ncenters around the files which he keeps,<br />\non every bill in the legislature which is<br />\nof interest to Baltimore City. At the<br />\nend of the session, Jones will try to<br />\ncheck the city's record in the General<br /><br />\nStudent apathy is facing the organizers of the anti-Gordon Discipline Code<br />\npetition now in their third week of canvassing.<br />\nJim Cleary, organizer of the undergraduate petition, said that he had \"no<br />\nidea\" if his group can garner enough<br />\nstudent signatures to fulfil the 25% quota<br />\nrequested by President Gordon. So far,<br />\na few hundred students have signed the<br />\nPetition out of the 2,000 undergraduates<br />\non campus. The petition will be sent to<br />\nthe President in the next few weeks.<br />\nCleary stated that their main handicap<br />\nhas been general disinterest in the Discipline Code. \"Guys aren't taking any<br />\nPosition at all,\" Cleary asserted.\"Most<br />\nof them haven't read either Gordon's,<br />\nthe Student Affairs Committees' reports<br />\nor the News-Letter's account of the discipline issue.\"<br /><br />\nBlumenthal Pissed<br /><br />\n\"Couldn't Care Less\"<br />\nThe President of the Graduate Student<br />\nOrganization, Bob Cotter, said that the<br />\ngraduate anti-Gordon petition is going<br />\nvery slowly. \"We're just getting started,\" Cotter noted, \"but already we have<br />\nfound that a lot of graduates couldn't<br />\ncare less about the subject.\"<br />\nHowever, Cotter observed that the<br />\nGrad Organization is not trying to get<br />\n25% of their constituents to sign. \"We<br />\nare not doing this (petition) for Gordon<br />\nto consider. We are demanding that Gordon remove his document, that it was<br />\nillegitimate from the start for Gordon<br />\nto overrule the Student Affairs discipline report.\"<br />\nTo this Cleary asked, \"Gordon has<br />\nthe power. How can we demand anything?\"<br /><br />\nDr. Robert Crain of the Department of<br />\nSocial Relations is one of the instructors<br />\nin the Urban Studies Seminar.<br /><br />\nThe only student who seemed less<br />\nthan entirely satisfied with the program was John Blumenthal. His work,<br />\nuntil this week, had consisted of comparing assessments of property with<br />\ntheir actual price when sold on the<br />\nmarket. Blumenthal was going to work<br />\non an area-wide survey of this type for<br />\nthe Housing and Community Development Agency.<br />\nHe opted to change jobs in midstream, however, when he learned that<br />\nthe city planned to make such a survey city-wide. \"My work would have<br />\nbeen redundant,\" he sighed.<br />\nOne other complaint was voiced by<br />\nJones, who stated that the students<br />\ndeserved \"either marks or more credit\" for their work in Urban Affairs.<br />\nJones, who also holds another job, said<br />\nhe finds it difficult to keep the schedule<br />\nwhich his work requires.<br /><br />\nEat-in, Carry-out<br /><br />\nThis discussion at the Tuesday seminars center mainly on the students' experiences on their jobs. The five students from Morgan State have only attended the seminar once. One student<br />\nreturned a second time, but since then,<br />\nthey have virtually disappeared from that<br />\nphase of the program.<br />\nAll of the students voiced the possibility that the program might be expanded<br />\nfor next year. As yet, there is no organized activity to insure that be the<br />\ncase.<br /><br />\nAssault Shakes<br />\nGatehouse Calm;<br />\nN-L Dook Safe<br />\nspecial to the News\u2014Letter<br />\nNews-Letter Editor-in-Chief Richard<br />\nCramer was bodily assaulted and his<br />\nwell-being was threatened,<br />\nphysical<br />\nearly Monday morning by John Blumenthal, a Hopkins Junior.<br />\n, Blumenthal, one of five undergraduates participating in a new Urban Studies<br />\nprogram, accosted Cramer outside the<br />\nGatehouse at approximately 2:30 Monday<br />\nmorning.'Cramer had called him shortly<br />\nbefore to ask about the program and<br />\nBlumenthal's role in the Housing and<br />\nCommunity Development Agency.<br />\nWitnesses on the scene confirmed that<br />\nBlumenthal, alter demanding to see the<br />\narticle, grabbed Cramer at the neck and<br />\nattempted to wrest the notes on the story<br />\nfrom the writer's hand.<br />\nBlumenthal stated that if anything about<br />\nhim appeared in the article, he would<br />\n\"bust your (Cramer's) ass.\" Cramer<br />\nlater told police Officer H. G. Hilnbrand that none of the notes on the article contained anything which would be<br />\npersonally objectionable to Blumenthal.<br />\nWitnesses said that they believed Blumenthal was upset about being called at<br />\nsuch a late hour. During the telephone<br />\nconversation, according to Cramer,Blumenthal gave no indication that he was<br />\nother than mildly annoyed. As he entered the office, Blumenthal insisted that<br />\nhe had thought it was 8:00 a.m. This<br />\nseemed to annoy him most of all.<br />\nGeorge Klopfer, who was present throughout the episode, considered Blumenthal's actions unexplainable. \"It looked<br />\npretty dark for eight o'clock in the morning,\" Klopfer opined.

Despite much law-and-order bantering on the<br />\npart of concerned local officials, the state has not complied, nor made any concete effort in the direction of<br />\ncompliance.<br />\nThe original order came down from the civil rights<br />\ndivision of HEW, which warned that non-compliance<br />\nwould result in a loss of federal funds. Despite non-compliance, there has been no such loss. At the time of the<br />\norder\u2014until last - week\u2014the civil rights (i.e. enforcement)<br />\ndivision was headed by Mr. Leon Panetta. Last week, the<br />\nWhite House resigned Mr.Panetta, who was regarded as too<br />\nzealous for middle America on civil rights.<br />\nPanetta was reportedly the pawn in the latest of the<br />\nnever-ending series of Nixon-Finch power struggles, which<br />\nNixon invariably wins. This time Agnew had the gripe<br />\nfrom the White House side. It seemed to Agnew that<br />\nPanetta had diabolical plans to destroy white collegiate<br />\nsanctuaries in Agnew's own back yard, and possibly risk<br />\nexacerbating tensions by mixing the races.<br />\n\u2022Despite recent Supreme Court rulings calling for immediate integration wherever segregation or de facto segregation is found, Maryland colleges\u2014for that matter, Maryland<br />\nhigh schools--remain as they were a year ago, predominantly one-race institutions. The University of Maryland at<br />\nCollege Park, for example, was and is 99 per cent white.<br />\nIts Princess Anne County campus is 92 per cent black. And<br />\nso on down the line.<br />\nTo improve racial balance, the state college Board of<br />\nTrustees commissioned a $12,000 study of the problem,<br />\nand asked the administration of each college to submit its<br />\nown recommendations. The oursider can only assume that<br />\nthese reports have been carefully scrutinized\u2014for they<br />\nwere doubtless all in the bureaucratic verbiage that warrants scrutinization without regard to content \u2014and tossed<br />\naway, along with Mr. Panetta.<br />\nThe original deadline for submission of a desegregation<br />\nplan was set for last July. But'the summer, fall, and most<br />\nof the winter have passed without incident, as Maryland<br />\n- has still not submitted a plan and Nixonian officials have<br />\ndeclined to take public notice. Panetta became an exNixonian official precisely because he was no longer<br />\ndeemed trustworthy to remain silent while the law was<br />\nsystematically abused by government officials entrusted<br />\nwith its enforcement.<br />\nIsn't it nice having a Vice-President from Maryland?<br /><br />\nBy WILLIAM BENZON<br />\nAs Michael Brenson so astutely pointed out in<br />\nthis Journal awhile back, the myth of America has<br />\nbeen revealed for the lie it is: America is bareassed, not only before the world, but before herself. I would like to add a footnote or two to Mr.<br />\nBrenson's article.<br />\nAs the myth disintegrates the chief characteristic of our methods of decision making will become exposed: the reasons which inform our debate have little to do with the factors which impell the decision. This in part due to the nature<br />\nof institutional decision making; individuals efface<br />\ntheir personal identity, their very being, so that<br />\nthey might take a proper institutional role (example: a high administrative official in a wellknown Baltimore university who has no opinions<br />\nbecause he is a high administrative official.)<br />\nThis leads to total loss of moral responsibility<br />\n(examples: Dachau, the \"Presidio stockade, Song<br />\nMy); in another context the phrase \"psychological<br />\naddiction\" is used. But then,the institutions where<br />\ncreated by men and men have always been avoiding responsibility.<br /><br />\nTwo Are One<br />\nMake no mistakes; most of the people in this<br />\ncountry know (they even know it is they who are<br />\nresponsible--but they palm it off on...), who is<br />\nresponsible for this mess and they know it is a<br />\nmess. But then one has to believe in something and,<br />\nin the absence of any but the most senile of gods,<br />\none believes in one's country. The country in<br />\nwhich the patriot believes exists in a different<br />\nuniverse of discourse from the country in which<br />\nhe earns his bread and is nagged to buy buy buy!<br />\nIt hasn't yet occurred to him that the two are in<br />\nfact one.<br />\n-But as the myth dies he will be forced to see<br />\nthat the two are indeed one. Herein lies a great<br />\nhope and a great despair.Whatwill the reaction to<br />\ntruth be?<br /><br />\nEternal Dilemna<br /><br />\nDifferences Trivial<br />\nA local example of this split can be seen in the<br />\nabove mentioned Baltimore university. A number<br />\nof students, faculty ,and administrators decided<br />\nthat a student disciplinary code was needed.<br />\nThere are now two versions of such a code; one<br />\nversion prepared by an advisory committee and<br />\none prepared by the above mentioned high administrative official. The differences between the<br />\ntwo versions are trivial if one believes that a student discipline code is imperative and so there<br />\nshould be little difficulty involved in adopting one<br />\nversion or the other. But there is much quibbling<br />\nand many reasonings; and the real issue is: who<br />\nruns the university, the high administrative official or the students and faculty?<br />\nBut neither side can openly acknowledge, in<br />\nthis particular context, what the issue is (though<br />\nin private the students and faculty distrust and<br />\nresent this official and this official has complementary feelings), for then both sides would be<br />\nexposed, left naked. And the winter air is cold.<br />\nSo the quibble will continue behind it's schizophrenic screen.<br /><br />\nThe dilemma is not new, it is much more than<br />\nvery old. It is eternal. \"And they heard the sound<br />\nof the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool<br />\nof the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the<br />\ntrees of the garden. But the Lord God called to the<br />\nman, and said to him, 'Where are you?' And he<br />\nsaid, 'I heard the sound of thee in the garden,<br />\nand I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid<br />\nmyself.\" And the man blamed it on the woman,<br />\nthe woman blamed it on the serpent; the serpent<br />\nwas Satan and Satan blamed it on the Lord God.<br />\n(Only in comparison with being is non-being nothing.)<br />\nThe great hope lies in seeing the truth, accepting it and repenting Of past evil (which means to<br />\nacknowledge one's sin, but to do better in the future rather than using guilt for past sins as an<br />\nexcuse for doing nothing, don't look back). Given<br />\nthis, then;<br />\n...much more good thereof shall spring,<br />\nTo God more glory, more good will to Men<br />\nFrom God, and over wrath grace shall abound.<br /><br />\nGreedy Watchdog<br />\nComing Apart<br />\nSimilarly, the legal status of marijuana has<br />\nnothing to do with the merits or demerits of the<br />\ndrug; though that is the excuse which informs debate on the subject. The issue is political and social; hedonism vs. a perverted puritanism, young<br />\nvs. old, liberals and radicals vs. silent majority.<br />\nLikewise the ABM. The issue was not whether or<br />\nnot the ABM could possibly work or evenwhether<br />\nor not the arms race is something any sane man<br />\ncould believe in. Rather the issue was: do we throw<br />\nthat obscenely greedy watchdog another fillet or<br />\nmust he content himself with a bone? He was thrown<br />\na fillet, thus establishing that the master is still<br />\nafraid of his watchdog.<br />\nAnd Vietnam is filled with the corpses and<br />\npoisoned land engendered by this mismarriage of<br />\nreason and fear. Why are we there?\"Because they<br />\nasked us there, we gotta keep the world free for<br />\ndemocracy and we gotta save face.\" No! We're<br />\nthere because the makers of our foreign policy<br />\nare bumbling incompetents, because of the flaming xenophobia of the silent majority, because that<br />\nwatchdog likes his fillet and he has lots of friends<br />\nwho like to bury bones for the sake of burying<br />\nbones (they got big piles of them good bones!)<br />\nand because the sun shall never set on the Amurrican empire.<br />\nWe all know this and we have always known it;<br />\nbut we have never beenforced to admit it in public<br />\n(not even in the anonymity of a Gallup poll--who's<br />\nto say everyone really believes what he tells the<br />\nTHE WIZARD OF ID<br /><br />\nM it7Ni6HT!<br />\nMUT ARE<br />\nCt2IN&amp;<br /><br />\nDOWN<br />\nTHERE<br /><br />\n1-13<br /><br />\n416%<br /><br />\nTo face the truth is to regain some measure of<br />\ncontrol over the consequences of one's decisions<br />\nbecause one is no longer forced to believe a myth<br />\nwhich makes it impossible to affect the real sources of power. To face the truth is to change from a<br />\nsituation where reason exists only to give tangible<br />\nform and substance to a formless and endless need<br />\nfor power and control (eliminate all myths and<br />\nnothing is left but fear of the other and desire to<br />\ncontrol him) to a situation where power serves<br />\nto root abstract reason into the substance of the<br />\nearth so that flowers might bloom and flourish<br />\nrather than wilt and perish.<br /><br />\nTo turn from the truth is to invite chaos, and<br />\nthe great despair. For perhaps the truth is too<br />\nmuch to bear. In which case the myth is grasped<br />\neven more greedily; and the more greedily it is<br />\ngrasped, the more the life giving truth is choked<br />\noff; the more greedily the truth is choked off.<br />\nthe more greedily is the myth grasped. The<br />\nparasite destroys the host and thus destroys himself. The systems engineer would call it positive<br />\nfeedback. The logician calls it an infinite regress. For a plain speaking man it is a vacious<br />\ncircle. For the psychiatrist, schizophrenic disintegration. Sartre, the abyss.

Despite Administration grief,<br />\nAssistant Admissions Director Ronald Owens has done<br />\nmore than a commendable job. Hopkins may never be<br />\nable to portray anything but a lily-white foreign image to<br />\nits black students, but it's good to know that someone is<br />\npulling in the other direction.<br /><br />\npollster?). To not admit something in public is to<br />\nnot admit it as real; what is kept private disappears in sleep; what is before the public, before<br />\nothers, is real.<br /><br />\nA TKEATIGE<br />\nON WOMAN'S<br /><br />\n(NTomorJ.<br /><br />\nWNAr<br />\n1 T140U6,14T<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nFeb. 24, 1970<br /><br />\nPAGE 5<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would like to take this opportunity to comment on<br />\nyour Story in 'Jay's '`e -;t', February 20, 1970. .<br />\nAs you mention<br />\nyour article I have been at Hopkins<br />\nfor 4 years. I have had the opportunity to hear many<br />\ndifferent people expound on this \"Unique\" University<br />\nof.ours and also had the opportunity to hear the undergraduates complain vociferously about their problems.<br />\nIt seems like one of their biggest complaints is the fact<br />\nthat they (the undergraduates) feel as though they are<br />\ngetting short-changed in our \"Unique\" University. I<br />\nhave always been very empathetic about their criticism<br />\nbecause I, too, felt that the athletic department and<br />\nthe people involved in the programs centered at the<br />\nAthletic Center were also being `short-changed'.<br />\nI am finding, to my dismay, that one of the unique<br />\nqualities of this institution is that the undergraduates,<br />\nas exemplified by your article, are more than willing<br />\nto criticize any effort or attempt by their fellow students to achieve a certain amount of self satisfaction<br />\nand pride out of their involvement in athletics. This<br />\nwillingness to criticize is further reinforced by a strong<br />\ndesire on the part of the undergraduates not to get involved himself.<br />\nThey say, en masse, 'give us control of the University, give us more Professors and less graduate instructors, give us a Student Center, give us everything, but<br />\ndon't ask us to stand up and be counted. Don't ask us to<br />\nget involved, don't ask us to work in the inner city,<br />\nmental hospitals, athletic teams, school papers, or<br />\ncommittees. We don't want to make a constructive effort<br />\ntoward helping to solve the problems of our times, but<br />\ngive me a chance to sit back and criticise the few that<br />\nare.'<br /><br />\nSo we run a \"bush\" Fall Sports Banquet for 75 young<br />\nmen that gave something to Hopkins. They sure as Hell<br />\ndidn't play in front of large crowds, and they didn't get<br />\ntheir names in the Baltimore Sun very often and when<br />\nthey did lose games because they aren't 'professionals' they most definitely did get criticized by their<br />\nfellow students both in and out of the News-:Letter.<br />\nMaybe it was 'dull' to you, but I appreciated the fact<br />\nthat George Hayward gave his time to see all of our<br />\nand try to feel as if he were<br />\nlast fall<br />\ngames<br />\nassociated with a fine group of young men. I also<br />\nappreciated the fact that Vince Bagli was willing to<br />\ncome over to Hopkins and say 'Hello' to us for a roast<br />\nbeef dinner and the reason he was late was because<br />\nhe had to do a T.V. show. I also appreciated the fact<br />\nthat President Gordon attended along with Ross Jones,<br />\nDave Kaufman, Oz Steinwald, Bob Hewes. I also appreciated the fact that we can't go 1st class in the Banquet<br />\nbecause Hopkins just doesn't have the funds. Denny Cox<br />\nbrought his wife to the Banquet because he believed in<br />\nthe young men that were being honored that night. Denny<br />\nhad to pay for his wife's dinner just like the rest of the<br />\ncoaches that brought their wives and you know that Denny<br />\ndid for Hopkins last fall? He worked as an integral part<br />\nof our staff and didn't get a penny for his service.<br />\nI also realized, and would have been happy to tell you<br />\nif you asked, that the reason why the banquet was the<br />\nfourth of February is because many finals were given<br />\nduring the early part of December and the Captains requested that we postpone the banquet feeling a need to<br />\nstudy and try to catch upwith their classmates that spend<br />\nSaturday afternoons during the fall in the library. If you<br />\nconsult your calendar you will find that with registration<br />\nand the beginning of classes this is the earliest we could<br /><br />\nhave had the banquet. Remember George, your classmates were away for a few weeks on 'independent<br />\nresearch' at Stow, Vermont, Bahamas, and some other<br />\nintellectual resorts.<br />\nI don't think our banquet was 'bush'. I think you and<br />\nthe others that sit on the sidelines of all the games of<br />\nlife criticizing and unwilling to give of themselves are<br />\n'bush'.<br />\nThe true 'uniqueness' of this University is the 'fact<br />\nthat it allows the best and worst to come to the surface.<br />\nThank god we have the Russ Passarellas, Paul Aliens,<br />\nJoe Cowans, Charlie Cokers, Bob Hydes and even<br />\nthough he will never believe this the Rich .Convisers.<br />\nThe people that are willing to get involved, the people<br />\nthat are willing to 'stand up and be counted' the people<br />\nthat are willing to get in the arena of life and either 'put<br />\nup or shut up'.<br />\nWhy don't you start a campaign on campus to be positive - instead of negative. I assure you our football<br />\nprogram will survive your criticisms and complaints,<br />\nbut it would be so nice to think that someone was actually<br />\npulling for us to do well and truthfully care when we<br />\ndidn't. I have tried as a football coach and I know<br />\nour players have tried their best. Why don't you and<br />\nyour other cynics try to make a concerted effort to help<br />\nus build together toward a better University rather than<br />\nsit around criticizing the small measure of success we<br />\nhave achieved.<br />\nI assure you I would look forward to and welcome the<br />\nopportunity to work with you to make this fine University a better one.<br /><br />\nAlexander Sour<br />\nHead Football Coach<br /><br />\nKingdom and the Bowling Alley<br />\nBy JIMMY OLSENBERG<br />\nI was young then, still a freshman at<br />\ncollege, and I was in New York making<br />\nthe rounds for a newspaper job. I went<br />\nfirst, of course, to the New York Times,<br />\nor, as I had come to call it, My Bible.<br />\nAs I entered the building, I felt like<br />\nan aged, devout Moslem entering the holy<br />\ngates of Mecca.<br />\nInside, everyone seemed to have slightly graying, razor-cut hair that modishly<br />\ncame down over the collars of their<br />\nVan Ileusen shirts. Dressed in expensive, tailor-made pin stripe suits, they<br />\nchatted casually about yachting and polo,<br />\nand their tanned faced glowed with selfassurance. They had all graduated from<br />\nHarvard or the Columbia School of Journalism, or both.<br />\nUnfortunately, I was unable to get a job<br />\nat the Times, and with a shaky conscience, I took the cross-town bus to the<br />\nNews.<br /><br />\nLet's Crack Down!<br />\nNow, as a card-carrying Jewish liberal, I had always looked down on the<br />\nDaily News. I even used to cut out their<br />\neditorials and post them on my bulletin<br />\nboard, in order to impress girls with<br />\nmy wildly original,off-beat humor.Their<br />\nanti-dissent editorials usually went like<br />\nthis:<br />\nIt's high time that all these bleedingheart kooks and liberals quit their yapping about \"police brutality.\" These<br />\nCommie dupes will go to no end in their<br />\nKremlin-hatched smear job on the policemen of this nation. Along with the<br />\nsofties on the Supreme Court, these<br />\nlong-haired weirdoes are trying to handcuff the polico, while anarchists and<br />\ncriminals are running wild on the streets.<br />\nWe say let's put an end to all this hot<br />\nair on \"criminal's rights,\" and start<br />\nthinking about the rights of the lawabiding citizens of the nation. The only<br />\nthing a criminal understands is a good<br />\nknock on the head, and pronto!<br /><br />\nThe Late Show<br />\nAs I entered the city room of the News,<br />\nI rubbed my eyes in disbelief. The Daily<br />\nNews was actually nothing more than a<br />\nre-creation of all the movies on newspapers that I had watched on the Late<br />\nShow. Everywhere I looked, old men in<br />\nsuspenders, with their ties loosened,and<br />\ngreen, visors shading their eyes, were<br />\nbeneover ancient black typewriters,fur-<br /><br />\niously pounding away. Elsewhere, reporters were making phone calls as they<br />\nnervously<br />\nsmoked<br />\ncigarettes. Any<br />\nminute I expected Spencer Tracy or Humphrey Bogart to come in with the latest<br />\nscoop. I had always imagined that the<br />\npeople who turned outthe copy must surely be a group of well-educated practical<br />\njokers, turning out their drivel to mock<br />\nthe sub-literate masses who so eagerly<br />\ngobbled it up.<br />\nThis was not the case. The reporters<br />\nwho told those millions of readers about<br />\nsexpot scandals and mad rapists were<br />\nreally not that much different from their<br />\nreaders.<br /><br />\nScrew<br />\nBut what was even more amazing to<br />\nme was the lack of status accorded even<br />\nthe most illustrious editors. As I was<br />\nshown around the city room,occasionally<br />\nstopping to pick up a beer can that blocked my path, the personnel director pointed out various celebrities. \"That's the<br />\ncity editor,\" he said, pointing to a wizened, wrinkled old man in suspenders<br />\nwho sat at the head of a large table ogling<br />\nthe latest copy of Screw magazine.<br />\n\"Hey\", the old man exclaimed, \"take a<br />\nlook at that pussy!\" The others at the<br />\ntable looked up, and one aging man lumbered over to take a look for himself.<br />\nThe city editor spread out the photo of a<br />\nhefty brunette model lifting her skirt.<br />\nWe moved on to the other large desks,<br />\nand as he pointed out each one of the<br />\nvarious prominent people, I realized that<br />\nthere was very little glamour about them.<br />\nIn the Times, men in the same position<br />\nwould have 'the fabulous aura of demigods. Here, however, they were just<br />\nmen doing their jobs. They sat at<br />\ntheir desks like everybody else, and<br />\nthey were not separated behind heavy<br />\noak doors with gold letters on the outside. As I soon realized, although the<br />\nNews may be more strident in its trumpetings against threats to the American<br />\nWay of Life, it was e4remely tolerant<br />\nwithin the bureaucratic structure.<br />\nThe copyboys were almost all longhaired, except the black copyboys, who<br />\nwere decked out in Afros, dashikis,<br />\nbeads, or daz4ling silk shirts. On<br />\nweekends, reporters and copy editors<br />\nwould come in T-shirts, blue jeans,<br />\nand bermuda shorts. The younger reporters were liberals, as were most of<br />\nthe guys on the telegraph desk, and they<br />\nhad a bemused attitude towards the<br /><br />\nrantings in the editorial page.<br />\nEditorial policy was not democratically decided, but rather hatched from<br />\ntwo cubicles stuck in the Women's Department. There, forty-year veterans<br />\nlike Reuben Maury typed out their mutterings on pinko faggots. Reuben was<br />\na small, bent-over man, with suspenders, walking cane, and a straw hat.<br />\nWhen I would have to deliver a message to him, I'd enter his little room<br />\nonly to see him cackling over his editorials. He was occasionally seen at<br />\nvarious parts of the city room, hurriedly moving towards some destination<br />\nknown only to him, with a frozen grin<br />\non his face. His movements were quick<br />\nand jerky, like a toy puppet's. Once<br /><br />\na day, he would emerge from his office<br />\nin the 19th century, shuffle towards the<br />\ntelegraph desk, deposit his editorial,<br />\nwheel around, and head back to his<br />\nworld of Commies and hippies and rabble-rousers in the Women's Department.<br />\nMeanwhile, the young editor<br />\nwho had just received this latest editorial would glance at the copy, and<br />\nthen shake his head in disbelief. When<br />\nhe'd come into the city room, I would<br />\nalways wonder what must go through<br />\npoor Reuben's mind after he sees the<br />\ncopyboys dressed conspicuously like the<br />\nanarchists and Black Power fanatics he<br />\nhad just decried in his editorial.<br />\n(Part II of this article will appear in the<br />\nnext edition of the News-Letter).<br /><br />\nKeen, Torns of Pain<br />\nBy JAMES FEE MARTIN<br />\nOne more step in the increasing attempt to explore the previously overlooked darker side of an allegedly narrow and prudish Victorian morality has<br />\nbeen taken with the publication of LoveLyrics, hitherto surpressed private(and<br />\nrevealing) musings by that much-under*rated stylist James Whitcomb Riley, the<br />\nso-called \"Hoosier Poet.\"<br />\nLong known as the author of many<br />\nvolumes of children's poetry, and such<br />\nfolk.classics as \"When the Frost Is on<br />\nthe Pumpkin,\" Riley now reveals another aspect of his character as a tireless celebrator of the infinite variety<br />\nand sensual exaltation of the act of<br />\nphysical love.<br />\nFrom his precocious introduction to<br />\nthe paths of pleasure described in \"A<br />\nVery Youthful Affair,\" through the sheer<br />\nphysical immediacy of the memories in<br />\nLeonanie and Judith, (\"All forebodings<br />\nthat distressed me/I forgot as Joy caressed me...the soft touch of her hand/<br />\ntakes all breath....\" the author gives<br />\ncontinual insights into the state of Eros<br />\nin this country during the latter part<br />\nof the Nineteenth Century.<br />\nThe sadistic tendencies of the Victorian man have been the subject of<br />\nmany works, but rarely have we been<br />\ngiven the opportunity to view the corresponding trend towards masochism<br />\nwhich Riley approaches in such poems<br />\nas A Variation. Beginning with the invitation to \"Hate me just a little-come!\" he expresses the dual nature of<br />\nthe desire to at once inflict and re-<br /><br />\nlines like \"Make your<br />\nceive pain in<br />\nsobbing lips unsheathe/ All the glitter<br />\nof your teeth!\", the wish to destroy,<br />\n\"How I hate the torrid/ Touches of<br />\nyour splendid lips...\" and simultaneously to be overwhelmed - \"Now before me looms Something more than<br />\nhuman...Something to bow down before/<br />\nReverently and adore.\"<br />\nTurning from these deep probings into the dark heart of human desire, Riley<br />\noffers an apologetic for his actions in<br />\nHow It Happened, attempting to spread<br />\nhis hedonistic gospel among his more<br />\nrepressed contemporaries.<br />\nIn his last poems, one senses a certain weariness with the never-ceasing<br />\ndrive of depravity, \"...every briered/<br />\nWith keener thorns of pain....\", until<br />\nfinally, in Blooms of May, he cries<br />\n\"No more for me... \"No more - No<br />\nmore -\"<br />\nBut the joys of the flesh are never<br />\ncompletely lost, and When Age Comes<br />\nOn recalls once more the \"tide of raptures, long withdrawn,\" flowing back<br />\nin \"summer-floods\".<br />\nIn their outstanding edition of these<br />\nworks,<br />\nBobbs-Merrill has combined<br />\nthe poems with another long-hidden work<br />\nof genius from the same pried, the<br />\n\"Life Pictures\" of photographer William<br />\nB. Dyer. Evocative at once of age-old<br />\ndesires and the particular idiosyncracies of the age which produced them,<br />\nthese masterpieces of lecherous imagination run wild are the perfect companions for<br />\nRiley's sinuous inner<br />\nthoughts.<br /><br />\nPAGE 6<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nBlue Jay Swimmers Dunk Franklin - Marshall<br />\nbaturday afternoon, the varsity swim team added a second<br />\nvictory in one week to their credit by beating Franklin and Marshall, 74 to 21.

After the editorial went to<br />\npress, but before it appeared, word came from Bilgrave's office through a liaison that he would appreciate it if the News-Letter would cool down its attack on<br />\nthe admissions charges. For this favor assurancewas given that at the end of the<br />\n\"football\" season the entire policy would be reviewed.<br />\nThat was three months ago, and it is doubtful that the university has any intention of reviewing the policy until the end of the lacrosse season. This would be<br />\ntoo late for undergraduates to participate meaningfully in any decision making<br />\nbefore next year. Both the Fall and Winter season are now history except for postseason play. A review of the Admissions Policy is already one season late.

Bilgrave's refusal to allow this reporter to attend a meeting earlier this<br />\nfall<br />\nand the athletic committee's non-cooperation since Decerflber suggest<br />\nthat the<br />\nUniversity is guilty of the same thing they accuse the News-Letter of--hiding the<br />\ntruth.<br />\nCertain individuals in the Athletic Department feel that the News-Letter's<br />\n,sports pages should portray only the good aspects of their<br />\nprogram even though<br />\nthey realize that certain parts of their program are second<br />\nrate.
