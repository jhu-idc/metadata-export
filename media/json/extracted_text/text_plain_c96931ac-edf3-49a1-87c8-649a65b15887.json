The fact that there<br />\nare fourteen \"H\" men back, with<br />\na quantity of very promising material, gives an indication of our<br />\nprospects for this year.<br />\nEver since the memorable 11th<br />\nof November, enthusiasts looked<br />\nahead to the coming spring, and<br />\non December 8 the organization<br />\nmeeting was held. Candidates for<br />\nthe team were addressed by such<br />\nwell-known \"old timers\" as Coach<br />\nRaney Wolfe, Gerhardt Schmeisser, Dr. Abercrombie, Dr. Fred<br />\nBlanc, and \"Father Bill\" Schmeisser. From that time on, the team<br />\nhas been settling down to hard<br />\nwork to retain the championship<br />\nwon last spring.

Dr. Latane will continue<br />\nhis classes in history, in addition<br />\nto his new duties, which will not<br />\nbe assumed until Dr. Brush's departure in March.<br />\nThe new dean has been affiliated<br />\nwith the University not only in<br />\nthe capacity of professor, but also<br />\nas undergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudent, being a member of the<br />\nfamous Class of 1892. In 1895 Dr.<br />\nLatane received his degree of<br />\nDoctor of Philosophy, after three<br />\nyears of graduate work. He then<br />\nwent to Randolph-Macon Woman's<br />\nCollege, as professor of history<br />\nand economics, where he remained<br />\nuntil 1902. He was appointed professor of history at Washington<br />\nand Lee University, and remained<br />\nthere until the spring of 1913. In<br />\nthis year he received the degree<br />\nof LL. D. at the University of Alabama. Since then he has been a<br />\nmember of the faculty at this University, as head of the History<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nNot only is Dr. Latane well<br />\nknown as teacher, but also as lecturer, author and authority on<br />\nAmerican history. He has been<br />\nactively interested in all movements of a patriotic nature, and<br />\nhas been a member of the Maryland League for National Defense<br />\nfor several years. As chairman of<br />\nthe Committee of Arrangements,<br />\nhe presided over the meeting held<br />\nat the Lyric on Great Britain's<br />\nDay.

Mr. Baker is<br />\nan alumnus of Johns Hopkins,<br />\nhaving received his degree with<br />\nthe Class of 1892, and having<br />\ntaken a year of graduate work<br />\nhere. His election brings the number of alumni on the Board up to<br />\nthree, the others being John M.<br />\nGlenn and B. Howell Griswold, Jr.<br />\nThe result of this selection will<br />\nbe far reaching, for Mr. Baker,<br />\ndespite his many official duties,<br />\nintends to take an active part in<br />\nthe University's Councils.<br />\nThe benefits accruing to Johns<br />\nHopkins will, indeed, be manifold.<br />\nThe relations between the University, the Alumni Council and all<br />\nalumni will be greatly strengthened. This fact was probably realized by the Board, and indicates<br />\na desire on its part to recognize<br />\nmore fully the active work of<br />\nalumni. Men of importance in<br />\nbusiness and professional life all<br />\nover the country claim Hopkins as<br />\ntheir Alma Mater, and their awakened interest and activitiy, considered from a material viewpoint alone, should be very beneficial.<br />\nAlumni activities will now, represented as they are by three members of the Board, take on a new<br />\nmeaning. Mr. Baker will, furthermore, strengthen the conviction<br />\nheld to by the trustees, that the<br />\nfaculty should decide the educational policy of the University,<br />\nwithout interference in any way<br />\nfrom the Board.<br />\nThe Class of 1892, of which Mr.<br />\nBaker is a member, is the only one<br />\nwhich has kept its organization<br />\nunbroken since graduation.

The victims of color<br />\nblindness do not know that they<br />\nare color blind unless they have<br />\nbeen told, because they never have<br />\nhad the sensations of color which<br />\nthe normal person has. The Jennings test, which Dr. Dunlap will<br />\nuse, has been used extensively in<br />\nthe army and navy and takes only<br />\nabout three minutes per man.<br />\nAll the Freshmen at Johns Hopkins and at some woman's college<br />\nwill be put through this test for<br />\nseveral years to come, until several hundred or a few thousand<br />\ntests have been made. From these<br />\ntests the relative percentage of<br />\ncolor blindness among men and<br />\nwomen will be quite accurately determined. It is generally stated<br />\nthat there are more color blind<br />\nmen than women, but this statement is not based on any such<br />\n'thorough investigation as Dr.<br />\nDunlap intends to make. The<br />\ncolor tests on this year's Freshmen are to begin sometime this<br />\nweek.<br />\nThe army intelligence test had<br />\nbeen ordered for all members of<br />\nthe S. A. T. C., but was not be:<br />\ngun before the signing of the armistice, and consequently the order<br />\nwas rescinded. This test will be<br />\ngiven sometime this month to all<br />\nthe Freshmen at the same time.<br />\nHours for the test will be arranged<br />\nand announced later.<br />\nY . M. C. A.

Stuart, '20.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD.,<br />\n<br />\nFEB. 11, 1919<br />\n<br />\nAn Important Change.<br />\n<br />\nNo more faithful service could<br />\nhave been rendered Hopkins than<br />\nthat of Dr. Brush, who, succeeding Dean Griffin, served two years<br />\nas acting dean and nearly two as<br />\ndean. His intention of resigning,<br />\nwhich he declared some time ago,<br />\nwas a shock to the University.<br />\nTo whom could we now go with<br />\nour difficulties of schedule and the<br />\nlike? Who would hear us with<br />\nsuch sympathetic patience, and<br />\ngive such sound advice? We could<br />\nhardly conceive of our University<br />\nwithout him; we had lost a warm<br />\nfriend and counselor.<br />\nAs a dean, Dr. Brush was ideal.<br />\nHis faculty for quickly making<br />\nfriends, his intimacy with the student body, his tireless interest in<br />\ntheir.welfare, his tolerance, generosity, and practicality made him<br />\ninvaluable to the University. Besides the loss of a dean, Hopkins<br />\nhas lost an eminent French scholar; his classes were even a source<br />\nof interest and inspiration. We<br />\nwish him the utmost success in his<br />\nwork as president of Tome School.<br />\nIn casting about for a new dean,<br />\nthe University was particularly<br />\nfortunate in securing the services<br />\nof Dr. Latane. An authority on<br />\nmany historical, economic and political questions, he has achieved<br />\nthrough his lectures -and writings<br />\nwide reputation. - However busy,<br />\n<br />\nhe has always found time to devote to student affairs; and this<br />\ninterest, together with his perfect<br />\nfitness for the position, will make<br />\nhim a dean of whom we may be<br />\nproud.<br />\nDr. Latane's popularity with<br />\nboth faculty and students is most<br />\npronounced. He is one of the University figures that the Freshman<br />\nlearns to know at entrance, and<br />\nadmires more and more as maturer years bring true appreciation. The undergraduates' interest in him. was well evidenced by<br />\nthe unusually large attendance at<br />\nthe recent lunch-time Open Forum<br />\nlecture. It is certain that no<br />\nchoice of dean could have been<br />\nmore acceptable to the student<br />\nbody.<br />\nBaker A Trustee.<br />\n<br />\nOf great importance among the<br />\nUniversity's many progressive<br />\nstrides since S. A. T. C. demobilization, is the election of Newton<br />\nD. Baker to the Board of Trustees.<br />\nIt is an innovation for a native<br />\nof a State other than Maryland<br />\nto be selected as a Hopkins trustee. This departure from custom<br />\nin the case of Mr. Baker will make<br />\na broadening of the scope of Hopkins' activities throughout the<br />\ncountry. Our educational facilities and unique advantages to students, which have won us deserved<br />\nrecognition abroad, should be even<br />\nmore widely known and appreciated in this country; and the active participation\u2022 in Hopkins' affairs of such men as the Secretary<br />\nof War will do much toward this<br />\nend.<br />\nThe acquisition of Mr. Baker<br />\nwill, moreover, undoubtedly cement more firmly the relations<br />\nbetween the alumni and their<br />\nAlma Mater. He has always been<br />\ndeeply interested in Johns Hopkins, ever since his graduation in<br />\nthe Class of '92, which produced<br />\nmany most loyal alumni, and his<br />\nsubsequent year of graduate work;<br />\nand, through his influence, the interest of other Hopkins sons will<br />\nbe awakened. It is certain that<br />\nhis responsibility as trustee will<br />\neven increase his interest, and that<br />\nhe will be an indefatigable worker<br />\nfor Hopkins' progress.<br />\n<br />\nFACULTY NOTES<br />\nDr. Powell is not expected to be<br />\nback at the University as instructor in English until after<br />\nnext year.

Thomas Discusses \"Public<br />\nService Electric Power Systems.\"<br />\n<br />\nAt the first of this year's series<br />\nof Aldred Lectures, given by the<br />\nEngineering Department, Mr. Percy H. Thomas consulting engineer, of New York city, spoke on<br />\n\"Public Service Electric Power<br />\nSystems.\" He outlined to a large<br />\naudience the method of determining the price rates for various<br />\nclasses of consumers, described a<br />\nnumber of the safety devices, and<br />\ntold of many notable cases of short<br />\ncircuits.<br />\nThe smaller manufacturing concerns, said the speaker, are coming more and more to buy their<br />\npower instead of generating it, on<br />\naccount of the advantages offered,<br />\nof reliability and lower cost. The<br />\nonly concerns that find it cheaper<br />\nto make their own power are those<br />\nwho need steam for heating purposes; they can use turbo-generators that only take 10 per cent.<br />\nof the heat in the steam for electric power.<br />\nReliability is the greatest of the<br />\nmeasures of success, as a shutdown of a short time might involve the loss of thousands of dollars\u2014many times the actual value<br />\nof the power lost. This is true in<br />\na newspaper plant, for example,<br />\nor in a blast furnace, especially in<br />\nthe latter, where the molten<br />\ncharge solidifies and can only be<br />\nremoved at enormous cost. All<br />\nplants must have sets of reserve<br />\napparatus to guard against this.<br />\nThe cost of -power to the consumer is based upon two factors.<br />\nThe load factor, the ratio of the<br />\naverage load to the greatest load,<br />\narises from the fact that the consumption is not uniform, but<br />\nvaries during the day and during<br />\nthe year. Those who use current<br />\nsteadily should be charged less<br />\nthan those who use it in varying<br />\nquantities. The diversity factor,<br />\nthe ratio of the total load for a<br />\ncertain period to the total maximum loads of any group of consumers, arises from the fact that<br />\none consumer may have a light<br />\nload when another has a maximum \u2014 then the consumer who<br />\nuses his power when the other<br />\nloads are light should have a<br />\ncheaper rate. This last factor is<br />\nwhat makes the single central<br />\nplant cheaper.<br />\nAnother interesting point is the<br />\nreason for the relatively high cost<br />\nof power for domestic purposes.<br />\nThis class of consumers uses a<br />\nsmall amount of power with an exceedingly great outlay for meters,<br />\ntransformers,- distribution lines,<br />\netc., which fact justifies the greater rates charged. Most people do<br />\nnot realize this.<br />\nOther factors that help to keep<br />\ndown the costs are use of powergenerating units, so as to keep the<br />\nvarious units up to their best efficiencies under varying loads, distribution to \u2022certain consumers<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, FEBRUARY 11, 1919.<br />\nTerrible Thief Takes Telephone.<br />\n<br />\nCan it be true? Alas, yes;<br />\nsomebody has stolen the telephone<br />\nout of the booth near the Gilman<br />\nHall postoffice. We heard the rumor Friday morning, but did not<br />\nbelieve it until it was confirmed<br />\nby John Myers, with his hand on<br />\nhis heart. The telephone operator, next door, has purchased a<br />\npadlock for that door, to keep out<br />\nthe curious who ask for particulars.<br />\nWe asked several of the gentlemen around what they thought of<br />\na Raffles that would perpetrate<br />\nsuch a deed. One pronounced<br />\nhim as \"d\u2014m clever,\" another as<br />\n\"low down,\" and two Freshmen<br />\nwere rendered speechless with horror. The E. E. Juniors, when<br />\nasked, at first inclined to blame<br />\nthe crime on the M. E.'s, who have<br />\nof late been none too scrupulous<br />\nin the gentle art of misappropriation. They declared the thief deserved credit for his originality,<br />\nbut when asked how much, replied<br />\nthat the said credit ought not to<br />\nbe unlimited, as it was not an<br />\nunlimited phone.<br />\nThe president has hired detectives to locate the phone, and,<br />\nwhat is more important, the cash<br />\nthat was in the box (probably several hundred dollars).

In 1895 Dr.<br />\nLatane received his degree of<br />\nDoctor of Philosophy, after three<br />\nyears of graduate work. He then<br />\nwent to Randolph-Macon Woman's<br />\nCollege, as professor of history<br />\nand economics, where he remained<br />\nuntil 1902. He was appointed professor of history at Washington<br />\nand Lee University, and remained<br />\nthere until the spring of 1913. In<br />\nthis year he received the degree<br />\nof LL.

Since then he has been a<br />\nmember of the faculty at this University, as head of the History<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nNot only is Dr. Latane well<br />\nknown as teacher, but also as lecturer, author and authority on<br />\nAmerican history.

This fact was probably realized by the Board, and indicates<br />\na desire on its part to recognize<br />\nmore fully the active work of<br />\nalumni. Men of importance in<br />\nbusiness and professional life all<br />\nover the country claim Hopkins as<br />\ntheir Alma Mater, and their awakened interest and activitiy, considered from a material viewpoint alone, should be very beneficial.<br />\nAlumni activities will now, represented as they are by three members of the Board, take on a new<br />\nmeaning.

The victims of color<br />\nblindness do not know that they<br />\nare color blind unless they have<br />\nbeen told, because they never have<br />\nhad the sensations of color which<br />\nthe normal person has. The Jennings test, which Dr. Dunlap will<br />\nuse, has been used extensively in<br />\nthe army and navy and takes only<br />\nabout three minutes per man.<br />\nAll the Freshmen at Johns Hopkins and at some woman's college<br />\nwill be put through this test for<br />\nseveral years to come, until several hundred or a few thousand<br />\ntests have been made. From these<br />\ntests the relative percentage of<br />\ncolor blindness among men and<br />\nwomen will be quite accurately determined. It is generally stated<br />\nthat there are more color blind<br />\nmen than women, but this statement is not based on any such<br />\n'thorough investigation as Dr.<br />\nDunlap intends to make. The<br />\ncolor tests on this year's Freshmen are to begin sometime this<br />\nweek.<br />\nThe army intelligence test had<br />\nbeen ordered for all members of<br />\nthe S. A. T. C., but was not be:<br />\ngun before the signing of the armistice, and consequently the order<br />\nwas rescinded. This test will be<br />\ngiven sometime this month to all<br />\nthe Freshmen at the same time.<br />\nHours for the test will be arranged<br />\nand announced later.<br />\nY . M. C. A.

Brush to<br />\nserve as acting Librarian, he was<br />\nabsent from January 20 to May<br />\n25, spending some ten weeks in<br />\nFrance, visiting England twice<br />\nand Switzerland for a few days.<br />\n\"The task was, first, to arrange<br />\nfor library service to the American army and navy overseas; and,<br />\nsecond, to open the way to secure<br />\nuseful enemy publications for universities, colleges and public institutions of approved character,<br />\nincluding a number of the Governmental departments.<br />\n\"For the former purpose, the<br />\nAssociation had been accorded official status by the Commissions<br />\non Training Camp Activities, and<br />\nto the traveler were given letters<br />\nof authorization and introduction<br />\nby the Secretaries of War and<br />\nNavy to General Pershing and<br />\nVice-Admiral Sims, respectively.<br />\nIn interviews he will not soon forget, immediate and hearty sanction was given to the plans which<br />\nhad been worked out after arrival<br />\nin Europe, study of British methods and conference with allied organizations, and been presented by<br />\nappointment at their respective<br />\nheadquarters in Chaumont and<br />\nLondon, while, despite its preciousness at the moment, special<br />\ntonnage was provided, including<br />\nthat to serve our prisoners of war,<br />\nfor whom some material was<br />\nbought in Geneva.

Stuart, '20.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD.,<br /><br />\nFEB. 11, 1919<br /><br />\nAn Important Change.<br /><br />\nNo more faithful service could<br />\nhave been rendered Hopkins than<br />\nthat of Dr. Brush, who, succeeding Dean Griffin, served two years<br />\nas acting dean and nearly two as<br />\ndean. His intention of resigning,<br />\nwhich he declared some time ago,<br />\nwas a shock to the University.<br />\nTo whom could we now go with<br />\nour difficulties of schedule and the<br />\nlike? Who would hear us with<br />\nsuch sympathetic patience, and<br />\ngive such sound advice? We could<br />\nhardly conceive of our University<br />\nwithout him; we had lost a warm<br />\nfriend and counselor.<br />\nAs a dean, Dr. Brush was ideal.<br />\nHis faculty for quickly making<br />\nfriends, his intimacy with the student body, his tireless interest in<br />\ntheir.welfare, his tolerance, generosity, and practicality made him<br />\ninvaluable to the University. Besides the loss of a dean, Hopkins<br />\nhas lost an eminent French scholar; his classes were even a source<br />\nof interest and inspiration. We<br />\nwish him the utmost success in his<br />\nwork as president of Tome School.<br />\nIn casting about for a new dean,<br />\nthe University was particularly<br />\nfortunate in securing the services<br />\nof Dr. Latane. An authority on<br />\nmany historical, economic and political questions, he has achieved<br />\nthrough his lectures -and writings<br />\nwide reputation. - However busy,<br /><br />\nhe has always found time to devote to student affairs; and this<br />\ninterest, together with his perfect<br />\nfitness for the position, will make<br />\nhim a dean of whom we may be<br />\nproud.<br />\nDr. Latane's popularity with<br />\nboth faculty and students is most<br />\npronounced. He is one of the University figures that the Freshman<br />\nlearns to know at entrance, and<br />\nadmires more and more as maturer years bring true appreciation. The undergraduates' interest in him. was well evidenced by<br />\nthe unusually large attendance at<br />\nthe recent lunch-time Open Forum<br />\nlecture. It is certain that no<br />\nchoice of dean could have been<br />\nmore acceptable to the student<br />\nbody.<br />\nBaker A Trustee.<br /><br />\nOf great importance among the<br />\nUniversity's many progressive<br />\nstrides since S. A. T. C. demobilization, is the election of Newton<br />\nD. Baker to the Board of Trustees.<br />\nIt is an innovation for a native<br />\nof a State other than Maryland<br />\nto be selected as a Hopkins trustee. This departure from custom<br />\nin the case of Mr. Baker will make<br />\na broadening of the scope of Hopkins' activities throughout the<br />\ncountry. Our educational facilities and unique advantages to students, which have won us deserved<br />\nrecognition abroad, should be even<br />\nmore widely known and appreciated in this country; and the active participation\u2022 in Hopkins' affairs of such men as the Secretary<br />\nof War will do much toward this<br />\nend.<br />\nThe acquisition of Mr. Baker<br />\nwill, moreover, undoubtedly cement more firmly the relations<br />\nbetween the alumni and their<br />\nAlma Mater. He has always been<br />\ndeeply interested in Johns Hopkins, ever since his graduation in<br />\nthe Class of '92, which produced<br />\nmany most loyal alumni, and his<br />\nsubsequent year of graduate work;<br />\nand, through his influence, the interest of other Hopkins sons will<br />\nbe awakened. It is certain that<br />\nhis responsibility as trustee will<br />\neven increase his interest, and that<br />\nhe will be an indefatigable worker<br />\nfor Hopkins' progress.<br /><br />\nFACULTY NOTES<br />\nDr. Powell is not expected to be<br />\nback at the University as instructor in English until after<br />\nnext year.

Thomas Discusses \"Public<br />\nService Electric Power Systems.\"<br /><br />\nAt the first of this year's series<br />\nof Aldred Lectures, given by the<br />\nEngineering Department, Mr. Percy H. Thomas consulting engineer, of New York city, spoke on<br />\n\"Public Service Electric Power<br />\nSystems.\" He outlined to a large<br />\naudience the method of determining the price rates for various<br />\nclasses of consumers, described a<br />\nnumber of the safety devices, and<br />\ntold of many notable cases of short<br />\ncircuits.<br />\nThe smaller manufacturing concerns, said the speaker, are coming more and more to buy their<br />\npower instead of generating it, on<br />\naccount of the advantages offered,<br />\nof reliability and lower cost. The<br />\nonly concerns that find it cheaper<br />\nto make their own power are those<br />\nwho need steam for heating purposes; they can use turbo-generators that only take 10 per cent.<br />\nof the heat in the steam for electric power.<br />\nReliability is the greatest of the<br />\nmeasures of success, as a shutdown of a short time might involve the loss of thousands of dollars\u2014many times the actual value<br />\nof the power lost. This is true in<br />\na newspaper plant, for example,<br />\nor in a blast furnace, especially in<br />\nthe latter, where the molten<br />\ncharge solidifies and can only be<br />\nremoved at enormous cost. All<br />\nplants must have sets of reserve<br />\napparatus to guard against this.<br />\nThe cost of -power to the consumer is based upon two factors.<br />\nThe load factor, the ratio of the<br />\naverage load to the greatest load,<br />\narises from the fact that the consumption is not uniform, but<br />\nvaries during the day and during<br />\nthe year. Those who use current<br />\nsteadily should be charged less<br />\nthan those who use it in varying<br />\nquantities. The diversity factor,<br />\nthe ratio of the total load for a<br />\ncertain period to the total maximum loads of any group of consumers, arises from the fact that<br />\none consumer may have a light<br />\nload when another has a maximum \u2014 then the consumer who<br />\nuses his power when the other<br />\nloads are light should have a<br />\ncheaper rate. This last factor is<br />\nwhat makes the single central<br />\nplant cheaper.<br />\nAnother interesting point is the<br />\nreason for the relatively high cost<br />\nof power for domestic purposes.<br />\nThis class of consumers uses a<br />\nsmall amount of power with an exceedingly great outlay for meters,<br />\ntransformers,- distribution lines,<br />\netc., which fact justifies the greater rates charged.

We heard the rumor Friday morning, but did not<br />\nbelieve it until it was confirmed<br />\nby John Myers, with his hand on<br />\nhis heart. The telephone operator, next door, has purchased a<br />\npadlock for that door, to keep out<br />\nthe curious who ask for particulars.<br />\nWe asked several of the gentlemen around what they thought of<br />\na Raffles that would perpetrate<br />\nsuch a deed. One pronounced<br />\nhim as \"d\u2014m clever,\" another as<br />\n\"low down,\" and two Freshmen<br />\nwere rendered speechless with horror. The E. E. Juniors, when<br />\nasked, at first inclined to blame<br />\nthe crime on the M. E.'s, who have<br />\nof late been none too scrupulous<br />\nin the gentle art of misappropriation. They declared the thief deserved credit for his originality,<br />\nbut when asked how much, replied<br />\nthat the said credit ought not to<br />\nbe unlimited, as it was not an<br />\nunlimited phone.<br />\nThe president has hired detectives to locate the phone, and,<br />\nwhat is more important, the cash<br />\nthat was in the box (probably several hundred dollars).

Trouble<br />\nis localized by varying the critical<br />\nloads according to the distances<br />\nfrom the station.

A short circuit<br />\nin a manhole caused the street to<br />\nbe torn up to a radius of 12 feet,<br />\nas by a dynamite explosion.
