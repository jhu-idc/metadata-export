It is<br />\nanother to make the new idea into a commercial success.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nThis is the story of Oliver B.

But<br />\nto the intelligently curious observer, that was<br />\n\u2022 enough.<br />\nFurther experiments having satisfied him that<br />\nthe action was caused by alternating electric<br />\n<br />\ncurrents, he set to work, encouraged by his<br />\nknowledge of Westinghouse policies, to make<br />\npractical the newly found principle. Three weeks<br />\nof almost uninterrupted toil, and he had produced the first practical alternating current<br />\nmeter of the induction type\u2014the universal type<br />\nof the present time.<br />\nThus for the first time the measurement of the<br />\nquantity of alternating current passing through<br />\na line was made commercially practicable and<br />\nits distribution became possible from an economic<br />\nas well as an engineering point of view. In fact,<br />\nthe whole structure of our great power systems<br />\ndepends upon the accurate measurement, by<br />\nmillions of such meters, of the electricity used<br />\nin the homes and industries of the nation. So<br />\nwell was Shallenberger's work done, and so<br />\ncomplete was his conception of the possibilities<br />\nof his discovery, that for more than thirty years<br />\nhis fundamental idea has been in use in many<br />\nand various forms.<br />\nThe encouragement which Westinghouse has<br />\nalways given to new ideas, and the judgment<br />\nwith which they have been evaluated, are<br />\nnowhere better exemplified than in this story of<br />\nthe alternating current meter.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LET TER, NOVEMBER 15, 1921<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br />\n<br />\nFRESHMEN SHOW IMPROVEMENT<br />\nIN SCRIMMAGE WITH POLY<br />\n<br />\nSOPHOMORE CLASS APPOINTS<br />\nPEP COMMI1 TEE<br />\n<br />\nThe Home of<br />\n<br />\n(THE BOOK MART)<br />\n<br />\nContinued from page 1, col. 4<br />\nAfter the trouncing received at<br />\nSaturday<br />\nlast<br />\nSevern<br />\nhands<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\nClass who insist upcil dbcying<br />\nComplete Stock of<br />\nMedical Books and College<br />\nthe Freshman football team set- regulations.

It is<br />\nanother to make the new idea into a commercial success.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nThis is the story of Oliver B. Shallenberger,<br />\nand how in 1888 he discovered the principle<br />\nthat led him to invent the watt-hour meter,<br />\nthe familiar little device that makes practicable<br />\nthe commercial distribution of alternating current, which means 95% of all the electricity<br />\nthat is distributed.<br />\nShallenberger, who resigned a Naval commission to take up his work with Westinghouse,<br />\nmade his discovery while experimenting with<br />\na newly devised alternating current arc lamp.<br />\nHis attention was attracted by the behavior of<br />\na small spring which had fallen upon the main<br />\nmagnet of the lamp, into such a position that<br />\nthe forces proceeding from both the magnet<br />\ncoil and the extended soft iron core affected it.<br />\nAnd the simple little thing that he noticed was<br />\nmerely that the spring was slowly rotating! But<br />\nto the intelligently curious observer, that was<br />\n\u2022 enough.<br />\nFurther experiments having satisfied him that<br />\nthe action was caused by alternating electric<br /><br />\ncurrents, he set to work, encouraged by his<br />\nknowledge of Westinghouse policies, to make<br />\npractical the newly found principle. Three weeks<br />\nof almost uninterrupted toil, and he had produced the first practical alternating current<br />\nmeter of the induction type\u2014the universal type<br />\nof the present time.<br />\nThus for the first time the measurement of the<br />\nquantity of alternating current passing through<br />\na line was made commercially practicable and<br />\nits distribution became possible from an economic<br />\nas well as an engineering point of view. In fact,<br />\nthe whole structure of our great power systems<br />\ndepends upon the accurate measurement, by<br />\nmillions of such meters, of the electricity used<br />\nin the homes and industries of the nation. So<br />\nwell was Shallenberger's work done, and so<br />\ncomplete was his conception of the possibilities<br />\nof his discovery, that for more than thirty years<br />\nhis fundamental idea has been in use in many<br />\nand various forms.<br />\nThe encouragement which Westinghouse has<br />\nalways given to new ideas, and the judgment<br />\nwith which they have been evaluated, are<br />\nnowhere better exemplified than in this story of<br />\nthe alternating current meter.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LET TER, NOVEMBER 15, 1921<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br /><br />\nFRESHMEN SHOW IMPROVEMENT<br />\nIN SCRIMMAGE WITH POLY<br /><br />\nSOPHOMORE CLASS APPOINTS<br />\nPEP COMMI1 TEE<br /><br />\nThe Home of<br /><br />\n(THE BOOK MART)<br /><br />\nContinued from page 1, col. 4<br />\nAfter the trouncing received at<br />\nSaturday<br />\nlast<br />\nSevern<br />\nhands<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\nClass who insist upcil dbcying<br />\nComplete Stock of<br />\nMedical Books and College<br />\nthe Freshman football team set- regulations.
