It is a Hopkins tradition to speak to every Hopkins<br />\nman you pass on the campus.<br />\n9. In the spring each class holds a banquet. The<br />\nsophomore and freshman banquets are traditionally<br />\nlively affairs. The sophs taw to capture freshmen for<br />\ntheir banquet and the freshmen try to reciprocate in the<br />\nsame manner. Both classes attempt to held their functions<br />\nsecretly.

Now the leaders, who secured valuable suggestions at the first meeting, can<br />\nmore thoroughly plan future meetings and speakers.<br />\nThe series should be scheduled with a definite series of<br />\nquestions and faculty members to lead discussions on<br />\nthem.<br />\nStudent-faculty relations can be helped a great deal<br />\nby such an activity. Many problems, which may not be<br />\ntreated by two individuals, are brought to light<br />\nin such informal gatherings. The relationship among<br />\nthose present sometimies gives the feeling of intimacy<br />\nwhich allows free discussion on any subject.<br />\nThese fireside discussion groups appear to be worthwhile to all who participate in them. We are looking<br />\nforward to a very successful season ahead for the rest<br />\nof the year.<br />\n<br />\nThe Poll Analysis<br />\nWe cannot judge and interpret the results of the<br />\nrecent poll fairly and adequately without taking into<br />\nconsideration the varied type of motives and reasons<br />\nbehind the rigid \"Yes\" and \"No\" choice.<br />\nA fairly large number of students voted \"No\" because<br />\nthey did not feel the present bill desirable, but they<br />\nwanted an amendment or another bill permanently curtailing the Supreme Court's power. Some were personally warm supporters of President Roosevelt and his<br />\npolicies; yet they feared legislation empowering future<br />\npresidents also, when they might not be in accord.<br />\nOthers were clearly opposed to Roosevelt and anything<br />\nfor which he stands. A few wrote \"F.D.R.--dictatorship\"<br />\non their ballots, voicing the sentiments of many other<br />\nnegative votes.<br />\nThe student vote was very close. However to grasp<br />\nIts meaning correctly, one must appreciate the trend<br />\ntowards the positive camp of the bill's support, which<br />\nIs undoubtedly taking place not only among the students but among the entire American population. We<br />\nventure to say that were this poll to be taken a few<br />\nweeks ago, the rating would have gone heavily to the<br />\nopposition.<br />\nWe think that with more debate, discussion and enlightenment, more will turn to the support of the court<br />\nbill. Especially will the adherents of a court structorial<br />\namendment realize that a temporary, constitutional<br />\npressure is needed pending the long, difficult\u2014if not,<br />\nimpossible\u2014task of amendment.<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY<br />\nI was passing the time of day in the<br />\nusual fashion in the N. L. 0. with<br />\nMarge Wege and Ed. Through Wege's<br />\ninstigation, the Packing of the Court<br />\nwas being soundly lauded -- but<br />\nthat's not what I started to tell you<br />\nabout. We were sitting there as I said,<br />\nfeet on the desk, when the door was<br />\nabruptly flung against the wall. A<br />\nfigure of abject terror stumbled in.<br />\nIt was Uncle Humphrey. \"Puh!<br />\nPuh!\u2014 \"he gasped and fell into a deep<br />\nswound. We soon brought him around<br />\nand questioned him closely. \"What<br />\ndo you mean by coming in here yelling<br />\n'Puh! Puh!' and then passing out?<br />\nWhat do you?\" I asked, being by this<br />\ntime more aggravated than concerned<br />\nwith his integrity.<br />\nThe answer to our questions continued to be wild, unruly rolling of his<br />\neyes. Finally, however, when he had<br />\ngained his breath, he got up and came<br />\nover to us. \"Boys\", he said, with a<br />\ndemented look on his face, \"There's<br />\npixies on the campus!\"<br />\n\"Ha! Drunk again! Out varlet, lest<br />\nI slit thee to the gibbets!\" I shouted<br />\nand would have pushed him through<br />\nthe door, had not something earnest<br />\nin his look' arrested me.<br />\n\"But it's true, I tell you\", he<br />\nmoaned. \"There's a big circle of them<br />\nin the woods. I savii them as I walked<br />\nthrough.\"<br />\n\"Don't be silly, there's no such<br />\nthing as a pixy, Alcibiades proves it<br />\nin his tract \"Quid est Pixy?\" snorted<br />\nWege, the eternal student. This didn't<br />\ndeter the small man in the least. He<br />\ndrew himself up to his full height and<br />\nsaid, \"Very well, you puerile cynics,<br />\nif you are tacitly calling me a liar,<br />\nI shall leave. But \u2014 I have seen<br />\nPixies!\" He would have gone out had<br />\nnot some lesser Levering Lounger accidentally mashed him between the<br />\ndoor and the wall. This created a<br />\nsmall disturbance, but when we had<br />\nflayed in the Lounger and sunk him<br />\n<br />\nneck-deep in the mud beside the Pond,<br />\nwe gave aid to Uncle Humphrey's<br />\nmangled nose.<br />\nHe was, as you well can imagine,<br />\na pretty poor-looking specimen, and<br />\non that account we gave a kindlier<br />\near to his sorrows. \"If they were as<br />\nsmall as you say they were, and were<br />\njust sitting around in a circle, why<br />\ndid you run away, Uncle Humphrey?\"<br />\n\"Well-uh-I thought I might miss<br />\nyou if I didn't run,\" he smiled demurely.<br />\n\"You just got here in time, Uncle<br />\nHumphrey\" said Ed, turning the complete gentleman, \"We were just going<br />\nout to hear Walter Damrosch, weren't<br />\nwe, Wege?\"<br />\nNo one said anything<br />\n\"What?<br />\nabout it to me, I thought\u2014hey what's<br />\nthe idea of kicking me like that?\"<br />\n\"Now, Uncle Humphrey, suppose<br />\nyou show us where the pixies are.<br />\nFeature story,\" I added to Wege,<br />\nwho was engrossed in measuring columns on the dummy sheet. This<br />\nbrought him to his feet, and a shining light in his eyes. \"Feature story,\"<br />\nhe breathed incredulously, \"Where?\"<br />\n\"Over in the woods.

The main door of Gilman Hall is for use of seniors<br />\nonly.<br />\n2. Hats should be removed on entering the Gilman<br />\nMemorial Room.<br />\n3. Everyone is to tip his hat to the members of the<br />\nfaculty.<br />\n4. An unwritten rule given by President Goodnow<br />\nis that students may walk out of class if the professor<br />\ndoes not appear within five (5) minutes after the time<br />\nthe class is scheduled to meet.<br />\n5. Whenever the lacrosse team plays on its home<br />\ngrounds, a service flag bearing three gold stars and the<br />\nnames of W. Brown Baxley, Warren B. Hunting, and<br />\nTheodore Price are to be affixed to one of the goal nets<br />\nby the captain, to remain there throughout the game.<br />\nThe purpose is to keep alive the memory of a great<br />\nnational service and to inspire the teams of this University to noble and efficient action. The flag is in the<br />\nkeeping of the captain at all times.<br />\n6. A parade down Charles Street is held every year<br />\non the eve of the Hopkins-St. John's football game.<br />\n7. The play of cards, checkers, chess, etc., in Levering<br />\nHall is to be in the Lobby only. Other rooms are for<br />\nother purposes.<br />\n8. It is a Hopkins tradition to speak to every Hopkins<br />\nman you pass on the campus.<br />\n9. In the spring each class holds a banquet. The<br />\nsophomore and freshman banquets are traditionally<br />\nlively affairs. The sophs taw to capture freshmen for<br />\ntheir banquet and the freshmen try to reciprocate in the<br />\nsame manner. Both classes attempt to held their functions<br />\nsecretly. These two are proceeded by the Junior and<br />\nfollowed by the Senior \"banquet.\"<br />\nHow many of these are being observed? Are they<br />\nactually customs and traditions that are alive and being<br />\nfollowed today?<br /><br />\nREPRESENTED 10ft NATIONAL ADVERTISING SY<br /><br />\nNational Advertising Service, Inc.<br />\nCollege Publishers Representative<br />\n420 Mr.c.dsON Ave.<br />\nBOhTON<br />\ncrcAcio<br />\nLc A.<br /><br />\ntc)36<br /><br />\nNEW YORK, N.Y.<br />\n.

Now the leaders, who secured valuable suggestions at the first meeting, can<br />\nmore thoroughly plan future meetings and speakers.<br />\nThe series should be scheduled with a definite series of<br />\nquestions and faculty members to lead discussions on<br />\nthem.<br />\nStudent-faculty relations can be helped a great deal<br />\nby such an activity. Many problems, which may not be<br />\ntreated by two individuals, are brought to light<br />\nin such informal gatherings. The relationship among<br />\nthose present sometimies gives the feeling of intimacy<br />\nwhich allows free discussion on any subject.<br />\nThese fireside discussion groups appear to be worthwhile to all who participate in them. We are looking<br />\nforward to a very successful season ahead for the rest<br />\nof the year.<br /><br />\nThe Poll Analysis<br />\nWe cannot judge and interpret the results of the<br />\nrecent poll fairly and adequately without taking into<br />\nconsideration the varied type of motives and reasons<br />\nbehind the rigid \"Yes\" and \"No\" choice.<br />\nA fairly large number of students voted \"No\" because<br />\nthey did not feel the present bill desirable, but they<br />\nwanted an amendment or another bill permanently curtailing the Supreme Court's power. Some were personally warm supporters of President Roosevelt and his<br />\npolicies; yet they feared legislation empowering future<br />\npresidents also, when they might not be in accord.<br />\nOthers were clearly opposed to Roosevelt and anything<br />\nfor which he stands. A few wrote \"F.D.R.--dictatorship\"<br />\non their ballots, voicing the sentiments of many other<br />\nnegative votes.<br />\nThe student vote was very close. However to grasp<br />\nIts meaning correctly, one must appreciate the trend<br />\ntowards the positive camp of the bill's support, which<br />\nIs undoubtedly taking place not only among the students but among the entire American population. We<br />\nventure to say that were this poll to be taken a few<br />\nweeks ago, the rating would have gone heavily to the<br />\nopposition.<br />\nWe think that with more debate, discussion and enlightenment, more will turn to the support of the court<br />\nbill. Especially will the adherents of a court structorial<br />\namendment realize that a temporary, constitutional<br />\npressure is needed pending the long, difficult\u2014if not,<br />\nimpossible\u2014task of amendment.<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY<br />\nI was passing the time of day in the<br />\nusual fashion in the N. L. 0. with<br />\nMarge Wege and Ed. Through Wege's<br />\ninstigation, the Packing of the Court<br />\nwas being soundly lauded -- but<br />\nthat's not what I started to tell you<br />\nabout. We were sitting there as I said,<br />\nfeet on the desk, when the door was<br />\nabruptly flung against the wall. A<br />\nfigure of abject terror stumbled in.<br />\nIt was Uncle Humphrey. \"Puh!<br />\nPuh!\u2014 \"he gasped and fell into a deep<br />\nswound. We soon brought him around<br />\nand questioned him closely. \"What<br />\ndo you mean by coming in here yelling<br />\n'Puh! Puh!' and then passing out?<br />\nWhat do you?\" I asked, being by this<br />\ntime more aggravated than concerned<br />\nwith his integrity.<br />\nThe answer to our questions continued to be wild, unruly rolling of his<br />\neyes. Finally, however, when he had<br />\ngained his breath, he got up and came<br />\nover to us. \"Boys\", he said, with a<br />\ndemented look on his face, \"There's<br />\npixies on the campus!\"<br />\n\"Ha! Drunk again! Out varlet, lest<br />\nI slit thee to the gibbets!\" I shouted<br />\nand would have pushed him through<br />\nthe door, had not something earnest<br />\nin his look' arrested me.<br />\n\"But it's true, I tell you\", he<br />\nmoaned. \"There's a big circle of them<br />\nin the woods. I savii them as I walked<br />\nthrough.\"<br />\n\"Don't be silly, there's no such<br />\nthing as a pixy, Alcibiades proves it<br />\nin his tract \"Quid est Pixy?\" snorted<br />\nWege, the eternal student. This didn't<br />\ndeter the small man in the least. He<br />\ndrew himself up to his full height and<br />\nsaid, \"Very well, you puerile cynics,<br />\nif you are tacitly calling me a liar,<br />\nI shall leave. But \u2014 I have seen<br />\nPixies!\" He would have gone out had<br />\nnot some lesser Levering Lounger accidentally mashed him between the<br />\ndoor and the wall. This created a<br />\nsmall disturbance, but when we had<br />\nflayed in the Lounger and sunk him<br /><br />\nneck-deep in the mud beside the Pond,<br />\nwe gave aid to Uncle Humphrey's<br />\nmangled nose.<br />\nHe was, as you well can imagine,<br />\na pretty poor-looking specimen, and<br />\non that account we gave a kindlier<br />\near to his sorrows. \"If they were as<br />\nsmall as you say they were, and were<br />\njust sitting around in a circle, why<br />\ndid you run away, Uncle Humphrey?\"<br />\n\"Well-uh-I thought I might miss<br />\nyou if I didn't run,\" he smiled demurely.<br />\n\"You just got here in time, Uncle<br />\nHumphrey\" said Ed, turning the complete gentleman, \"We were just going<br />\nout to hear Walter Damrosch, weren't<br />\nwe, Wege?\"<br />\nNo one said anything<br />\n\"What?<br />\nabout it to me, I thought\u2014hey what's<br />\nthe idea of kicking me like that?\"<br />\n\"Now, Uncle Humphrey, suppose<br />\nyou show us where the pixies are.<br />\nFeature story,\" I added to Wege,<br />\nwho was engrossed in measuring columns on the dummy sheet. This<br />\nbrought him to his feet, and a shining light in his eyes. \"Feature story,\"<br />\nhe breathed incredulously, \"Where?\"<br />\n\"Over in the woods.
