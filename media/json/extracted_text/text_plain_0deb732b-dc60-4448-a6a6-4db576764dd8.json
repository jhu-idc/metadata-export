As a<br />\nresult of this the report claims \"the majority of men and women<br />\nwho leave eollege have not had any work in this field.\" The<br />\nHopkins is one of the 95 per cent of the universities that does<br />\nnot require \"even one course in American literature.\" Therefore,<br />\nit does seem that the Hopkins graduate would, like the majority<br />\nof students cited by the study, have had no work in Amencan<br />\nliterature during his matriculation at the Vniversity. Here, however, the method of the Crane report is not adequate.<br />\nAlthough it is not, necessary for the Hopkins candidate for<br />\na BA or BS degree to take a course in American literature, a<br />\ncourse in occidental history and a course in freshman writing are<br />\nrequired. This history survey, which includes an introduction<br />\nthe American historical traditions, contradicts the failure claimed<br />\nby the Crane report. The writing course requires the reading of<br />\ncontemporary essays by American writers and journalists. At<br />\nthe end of the freshman year the Ilopkins student has been exposed<br />\nto both the cultural and historical traditions of this country.<br />\n<br />\nro<br />\n<br />\nThe number of elective courses offered by most of our institutions is not impressive, continues Dr Crane's study, and this<br />\ncontributes to the general lack of knowledge regarding our<br />\nheritage. The first formal American Literature course of the Hopkins was introduced by Dr Charles Anderson in 1941. Since that<br />\ntime the course has been offered in alternating years. When 120<br />\nstudents enrolled in the. American lit course in 1947, the English.<br />\ndepartment continued the course on a yearly basis. This one<br />\ncourse in American literature does not represent a complete<br />\nconsideration of undergraduate courses offered at the Hopkins that<br />\nprovide the student a background in the traditions of this country.<br />\n\"The History of American Thought,\" a course instructed<br />\nby Dr Charles A Barker, would not be included in the Crane<br />\naurvey of literature courses. This course, however, provides, a<br />\nstrong background in American traditions and draws on American<br />\nliterature for a great many of its references. Among the electives<br />\navailable for the Hopkins undergraduate are courses in American<br />\nphilosophy, American painting and sculpturing, as well as courses<br />\ndealing with American economics, government and geography.<br />\nCertainly every one of these courses serves as a background in<br />\nour historical and cultural heritage.<br />\nThe Crane report presents a challenge to the existing college<br />\ncurrieulums and already it has created considerable interest among<br />\neducators. It certainly calls for all inspection of the individual<br />\ncollege or university's relation to the overall problem.

As a<br />\nresult of this the report claims \"the majority of men and women<br />\nwho leave eollege have not had any work in this field.\" The<br />\nHopkins is one of the 95 per cent of the universities that does<br />\nnot require \"even one course in American literature.\" Therefore,<br />\nit does seem that the Hopkins graduate would, like the majority<br />\nof students cited by the study, have had no work in Amencan<br />\nliterature during his matriculation at the Vniversity. Here, however, the method of the Crane report is not adequate.<br />\nAlthough it is not, necessary for the Hopkins candidate for<br />\na BA or BS degree to take a course in American literature, a<br />\ncourse in occidental history and a course in freshman writing are<br />\nrequired. This history survey, which includes an introduction<br />\nthe American historical traditions, contradicts the failure claimed<br />\nby the Crane report. The writing course requires the reading of<br />\ncontemporary essays by American writers and journalists. At<br />\nthe end of the freshman year the Ilopkins student has been exposed<br />\nto both the cultural and historical traditions of this country.<br /><br />\nro<br /><br />\nThe number of elective courses offered by most of our institutions is not impressive, continues Dr Crane's study, and this<br />\ncontributes to the general lack of knowledge regarding our<br />\nheritage. The first formal American Literature course of the Hopkins was introduced by Dr Charles Anderson in 1941. Since that<br />\ntime the course has been offered in alternating years. When 120<br />\nstudents enrolled in the. American lit course in 1947, the English.<br />\ndepartment continued the course on a yearly basis. This one<br />\ncourse in American literature does not represent a complete<br />\nconsideration of undergraduate courses offered at the Hopkins that<br />\nprovide the student a background in the traditions of this country.<br />\n\"The History of American Thought,\" a course instructed<br />\nby Dr Charles A Barker, would not be included in the Crane<br />\naurvey of literature courses. This course, however, provides, a<br />\nstrong background in American traditions and draws on American<br />\nliterature for a great many of its references. Among the electives<br />\navailable for the Hopkins undergraduate are courses in American<br />\nphilosophy, American painting and sculpturing, as well as courses<br />\ndealing with American economics, government and geography.<br />\nCertainly every one of these courses serves as a background in<br />\nour historical and cultural heritage.<br />\nThe Crane report presents a challenge to the existing college<br />\ncurrieulums and already it has created considerable interest among<br />\neducators. It certainly calls for all inspection of the individual<br />\ncollege or university's relation to the overall problem.
