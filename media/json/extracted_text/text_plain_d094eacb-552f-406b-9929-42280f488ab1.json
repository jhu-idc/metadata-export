You can't affect any changes unless your<br />\nconstituency is behind you.<br />\n3. As I said the other day, the News-Letter should<br />\nmaintain a critical stance in regard to the Council while,<br />\nat the same time, conveying the issues.

But I'm taking nothing fot<br />\ngranted. Each election is a new one. I believe I have the<br />\nmomentum, but momentum isn't votes.<br />\n2. There is no \"single\" major issue if you can<br />\ncharacterize the campaign. I'm afraid it would concern<br />\nthe plight of the undergraduate; undergraduate in equity<br />\nin housing, questionable financial aid practices, incredibly<br />\ndisorganized social calendar among others.<br />\n3. Potentially, and I emphasize potentially, the<br />\nNews-Letter has one of the most important roles as being<br />\nthe spokesman for students' needs, desires, and opinions.<br />\nThe News-Letter is a major source of information not<br />\nonly to students but to the administration, the faculty,<br />\nand the trustees. As such, the NewsfLetter has a certain<br />\n<br />\nresponsibility to take the lead in co-operation with \u2022<br />\nviable student government to press for student needs.<br />\n5. I plan to during the rest of this year to institute a<br />\ncomplete stud'y on the structure of the Student Council,<br />\nparticularly in the area of committee structure.

Should I take office in September, I would<br />\nimmediately implement the plans developed over the<br />\nsummer and through the rest of this semester.

In<br />\naddition to working on the Hopkins 400 admission<br />\nprogram, Molander was able to compile a list of<br />\nrecommendations, and made critical remarks on his boss,<br />\nDr. George Benton in the News-Letter.<br />\nLast year Molander started in September (15). This<br />\nYear the job was vacant until March and lack of time is<br />\nnow the new student assistant's main hindrance. What<br />\ncaused the delay? Benton was responsible, although<br />\nunintentionally.<br />\nDuring the summer. Benton was unwilling to retain the<br />\nPosition at all. \"I have always had questions about the<br />\nPosition,\" he stated, \"because my office doesn't interact<br />\nWith - students that much.\" Areas over which he presides,<br />\nsuch as the library, admissions, and the computer center,<br />\nall ahve advisory commiitees to function as liasons to the<br />\nStudent Council, he said.<br />\n\"The office has not been mirroring success in the<br />\npast,\" he continued. \"Eric Molander was in many ways a<br />\nbig help, but when you really look at what he did, it was<br />\nWith Larry Denton, not with my office.\"<br />\nBenton hoped not to continue the assistantship this<br />\nyear. During the fall, however, the Student Council, in the<br />\nperson of Steve Ponchak pleaded with him to reinstate<br />\nthe job. Finally, late in the semester, he agreed to<br />\n\"compromise\" and grant the position.<br />\nIt was determined that the selection of an assistant<br />\nwould be handled by the Council, with Benton reserving<br />\nthe right to veto any of the candidates selected., The<br />\nprocess could not begin, related Steve Lovejoy, chairman<br />\nof the Selections Committee, until after Intersession, so<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\npotential applicants could be informed. Two people were<br />\nselected to be interviewed by Benton, Koenigsberg and<br />\nSteve Simms, who was Molander's assistant last year. It<br />\ntook one week for the committee to make these<br />\nselections and have them ratified in full council. Then,for<br />\na week\u2014\"the crucial week\" according to Lovejoy, Benton<br />\nwas completely unavailable, and the candidates had to<br />\nwait until the next week to meet with Benton. \"I spoke<br />\nto him for 5 minutes, and he did not find me<br />\nobjectionable,\" recalled Koenigsberg. After another week,<br />\nthe final selection of Koenigsberg was announced.<br />\n\"There are two reasons why she can't accomplish<br />\nmuch,\" commented Jill Leukhardt, a Council member,<br />\nMolander's fiancee, and who has done considerable<br />\nresearch on the position. \"Time is short, of course. There<br />\nis also almost a lame duck feeling because there are not<br />\ngoing to be any major decisions made until Benton's<br />\nsuccessor takes over.\" (Benton is resigning, effective June<br />\n30).<br />\nKoenigsberg i\u00a7 aware of the handicaps under which she<br />\ntook the position. \"The biggest hitch is that Benton did<br />\nnot pick a person to do what I want to do,\" she stated.<br />\n\"They don't have to be paying someone to be Benton's<br />\nassistant to work on the Hopkins 400.\" She added, \"I<br />\ndon't have to do anything more than make a beginning.'<br />\nThe Hopkins 400 program is envisioned by Benton as<br />\none of her two major duties. It entails working cl9sely<br />\nwith Larry Denton, Academic Services Director, on the<br />\nreception of 400 top applicants for a visit to the<br />\nHomewoOd campus. It does not, properly speaking,<br />\nrequire coordination with Benton's office. This contact<br />\nwith Denton, rather than Benton, was precisely the paint<br />\non which Benton criticized his previous assistants.<br />\nBenton acknowledged that Koenigsberg will be in a<br />\ndifficult position. \"I think there are Some Constructive<br />\nthings she can do, but it's quite obvious that she can't do<br />\nwhat sht could have done if she had been here since last<br />\nfall. This is a time of year she must -work with Larry<br />\nDento. We really don't have a chance to give it (the<br />\nstudent assistantship) a fair trial this year.\"<br />\nWhat 'about next year? If Benton were continuing, he<br />\n<br />\nwould invite Koenigsberg back next year. He is resigning,<br />\nhowever, and he is planning to give his successor \"a<br />\nbackground of the position and what I think its strengths<br />\nand weaknesses are\u2014then, he'll just have to make up his<br />\nown mind.\" The new Student Council, too, will have to<br />\nendorse her.<br />\nIn the time she has left this year, Koenigsberg's primary<br />\nfunctions will be to work with the Hopkins 400 and to<br />\nserve as liason between the Vice President and the<br />\nStudent COuncil. It will be difficult, but necesiary, for her<br />\nto compile a list of achievements sufficient to enable her<br />\nto continue and accomplish something next year.<br />\n;Otherwise, the four year old job will probably be<br />\ndiscontinued as the new Vice-President starts off with a<br />\nclean slate.<br />\n<br />\nMerit scholarships scalded by Council<br />\nBy MICHEL STEVEN KRUG<br />\nThe number of merit scholarships for the ,1977-78<br />\nacademic year will be increased by 33 per cent, officials<br />\nfrom the Financial Aid office announced last week.<br />\nMembers of the Student Council, however have criticized<br />\nthe increase because the awards are not granted on the<br />\nbasis of financial need.<br />\nLarry Denton, Director of Academic Services, said $65<br />\nthousand will be available to students who qualify for the<br />\nawards on the basis of their academic excellence and<br />\noutstanding achievements in the social realm. Fifty $1<br />\nthousand scholarships were awarded this year. Merit<br />\n/ \u2022 scholarships are divided among the student body, but<br />\nt)..1 with particular emphasis to entering Freshmen. Denton<br />\nestimated that 25 to 30 entering freshmen will receive<br />\nmerit awards, while the other 35 awards are to be divided<br />\namong previous recipients who maintain an acceptable<br />\nlevel of academic performance to merit continuation of<br />\ntheir special grants. Approximately ten students will be<br />\nselected from eligible upperclassmen Who had received no<br />\nprior merit awards<br />\nVociferous Debate<br />\nmembers vociferously debated with<br />\nCouncil<br />\nStudent<br />\nDenton and Wayne Hood, Director of Financial Aid<br />\nduring their weekly meeting last Thursday evening, that<br />\ntoo many students will receive merit scholarships without<br />\nfinancial need. These opponents contend monies<br />\nmandated for merit scholarships should be delegated to<br />\nstudents through a system \\similar to the College<br />\nScholarshin Service (CSS). A family's income, their liquid<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nand non-liquid assets, and their number of children are<br />\nfactors included in the CSS evaluation. .<br />\nBut Denton contends the CSS system is \"very<br />\nimprecise. It's a ranking device more than a needs analysis<br />\ntest.\" Many students mistakenly believe that reliance on<br />\nthe CSS system will send the money where it's most<br />\nneeded, but they're wrong, he said. Asked whether some<br />\nmerit scholarship recipients already had been endowed<br />\nwith sufficient financial support from their parents,<br />\nDenton said students whose parents have an income<br />\nexceeding $40 thousand a year are not eligible for merit<br />\nscholarships. \"There just aren't any on the list,\" he said.<br />\nBut Student Council further objected . to the very<br />\nnature of scholarships awarded on the basis of academic<br />\nprowess. \"Once we're admitted, students should be<br />\ntreated on an equal basis,\" Student Council member Jill<br />\nLeukhardt said. Denton, however, said \"I think private<br />\ninstitutions are in the business of awarding and promoting<br />\nacademic excellence. If there is a reason to exist as a<br />\nprivate institution, this is it. Most of the things we do<br />\naround here are done on the basis of achievement. It's the<br />\nway it is.\" Until 1960, scholarships were awarded oh a<br />\npurely academic scale. It was only the last fifteen years<br />\nwhen the emphasis was shifted to financial need, he<br />\nadded.<br />\nMerit scholarships are used as lures for prospective<br />\nfreshmen, but Denton denies that Hopkins makes a<br />\npractice of buying students. We try to put together the<br />\nbest possible package, offering scholarships, national<br />\ndirect student loans, and the work study program, he said.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 4/news-letter/march 22, 1977<br />\n<br />\nMcCollum -Pratt:<br />\nLife in Future?<br />\nBy GAYLE COHEN<br />\nThe McCollum.Pratt Institute, the biological research<br />\ndivision of the university, has been the site of recent<br />\ndiscoveries in the study of evolution and bioluminesence.<br />\nDr. Dennis Powers* studies of fish have led to inroads in<br />\nthe understanding of evolution.

He found that fish living in fast-moving<br />\nstreams have . a hemoglobin component. lacking in<br />\nslow-water fish, which enables them to continue to bind<br />\noxygen in the gills despite the rigorous exercise of<br />\nswimming in fast-moving waters. This observation has<br />\nimportant implications for the conflicting theories of<br />\nevolution\u2014survival of the fittest and random mutations.<br />\nDr. Howard Seliger, another McCollum-Pratt member,<br />\n;X working on marine ecology, especially as it pertains .to<br />\nthe Chesapeake Bay. His studies have led him to believe<br />\nthat the Bay is basically healthy, despite recent publicity<br />\nproclaiming the Bay's defects. Seliger said, \"The Bay is\u2014<br />\nnot as sick as they think. Our work is designed to say<br />\nsomething more than just that we're unhappy about<br />\nthings.\"<br />\nSeliger has also been studying bioluminescence, the<br />\nlight emitted by animals when they are disturbed. In<br />\nparticular, he has been studying the relationship between<br />\nmolecules that are in an excited, light-producing state,<br />\nand the production of mutations. Seliger explained,<br />\n\"We're measuring the chemical luminescense of<br />\ncarcinogens (cancer-producing agents). There seems to be<br />\na correlation between the chemuluminescents and the<br />\ncarcinogens. We're working on how these<br />\nchemically-formed, excited states produce light.\"<br />\nBesides their implications for the advance of science in<br />\ngeneral, the studies of Powers and Seliger reflect<br />\n<br />\ninnovations within the Institute itself. .<br />\nIt was founded in 1947 to study micronutrients,-but<br />\nthe Institute's work.now spans all facets of biology. The<br />\nInstitute broadened its scope to coincide with increases in<br />\nthe volume of scientific knowledge and the widening<br />\ninterests of its staff.<br />\nAnother change from the original set-up is<br />\nMcCollum-Pratt's close affiliation with the Biology<br />\nDepartment. According to Dr. William Harrington,<br />\nChairman of the Biology Department and<br />\nthe<br />\nMcCollum -Pratt Institute are tenuous. It<br />\n(McCollum-Pratt) is now an institution within an<br />\ninstit ution (the Biology Department).\" All ten of<br />\nMcCollum-Pratt's current members, also belong to the<br />\nfaculty of the Biology Department.<br />\nThe virtual merger of the two occurred in 1955 when<br />\nDr. William McElroy became chairman of the Biology<br />\nDepartment during his directorship of McCollum-Pratt.<br />\nThis has been a dual position ever since.<br />\nAs part of this closer consolidatio, .McCollum-Pratt<br />\nmoved into Mergenthaler Hall with the Biology<br />\n<br />\nDepartment. In adidtion to .the Mergenthaler facilities,<br />\nMcCollum -Pratt has retained its facilities in the<br />\nGreenhouse. The Greenhouse is \"where animals are bred<br />\nand held for various biological experimentation,\" said<br />\nHarrington, adding that McCollum-Pratt uses \"no<br />\ndogs\u2014only small rodents, such as rabbits, guinea pigs, and<br />\nmice.\"<br />\nMcCollum-Pratt also operates a field station on the<br />\nRhode River, five miles south of Annapolis. Seliger<br />\nexplained, \"The Rhode River facility is owned by the<br />\nSmithsonian Institute. We use it to study the Rhode River<br />\nin comparison with the Chesapeake Bay and for designi<br />\nng<br />\nexperiments before going out into the Bay. We use the<br />\nfacilities of the Chesapeake Bay Institute for our research<br />\non the Bay.\" In addition, McCollum-Pratt has a 23-foot<br />\ncabin cruiser and two completely-equipped laborat<br />\nory<br />\ntrailers.<br />\nThe McCollum-Pratt Institute is named after John Lee<br />\nPratt, who left the grant on which the Institute. was<br />\nfounded, and E.V. McCollum, the Hopkins professor who<br />\ndiscovered vitamin A.<br />\n<br />\nCarter-Admirable and Righteous but not Realistic<br />\nPresident Carter delivered a strong and hopeful address<br />\nto the United Nations Assembly last Thursday that<br />\nclarified a number of previously undefined issues of<br />\nAmerican foreign policy, but left an equal number of<br />\nissues in obscurity. The emphasis of the speech was on<br />\ninternational harmony, a global economy, and human<br />\nrights. In each of these areas Mr. Carter proposed to work<br />\nwith all countries that are \"ready to work with us in<br />\npromoting global progress.\" Cooperation and assistance to<br />\nthose who need it underlie his 'new foreign policy.'<br />\nEarly in his speech, Mr. Carter realistically stated that<br />\n\"the United States cannot solve the problems of the<br />\nworld. We can sometimes help others resolve their<br />\ndifferences, but we cannot do so by imposing our own<br />\nparticular solutions.\" These words reflect the truth that<br />\nhas been long to arrive in American foreign policy. It is<br />\nthe epitaph of our last decade and a firm step toward<br />\n(educed American military involvement<br />\nabroad in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nLikewise, Mr. Carter's support of majority rule in<br />\nAfrica is a timely stand taken on an issue about to<br />\nexplode. His speech, though, offered no suggestions as to<br />\nwhat role the United States should play in bringing about<br />\nthe \"fundamental transformation\" in Rhodesia. Mr.<br />\nCarter is opposed to a \"protracted racial war\"(does this<br />\nexclude support for a quick, conclusive one?) and has<br />\nrecently signed a ban on the importation of chrome from<br />\nwhat has for the first time been spoken of as \"the illegal<br />\nregime in Rhodesia\".<br />\nIn some respects however, President Carter's idealism<br />\nmay be clouding his conception of the world as it exists in<br />\n1977 and as it will be for some time to come. This is<br />\nespecially true in such matters as the arms race, the<br />\nunderdeveloped nations and, Mr. Carter's favorite issue,<br />\nhuman rights in all nations. The arms reduction issue, a<br />\nmajor theme in his speech, is as old and as stubborn as<br />\never. The arms race has been the subject of international<br />\nconferences and treaties since the two World Wars, and<br />\ncuriously enough, the most heated discussion takes place<br />\nprior to times of war. The arms race has become the<br />\ncancer of international order, and proliferation will<br />\n<br />\n011\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\narticle by K.E.T.<br />\ngraphic by Stein<br />\nIMO<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\ncontinue until all countries have access to nuclear<br />\nweapons. After all, how can Mr. Carter speak of equality<br />\nand justice if the possession of these lethal weapons is<br />\nlimited and their use is confined to the members of an<br />\n'elitist' nuclear club?<br />\nIt is also in the spirit of cooperation that Mr. Carter<br />\nsuggests that developing countries \"must acquire fuller<br />\nparticipation in the global economic decision-making<br />\nprocess,\" but what will this.mean to American banking<br />\nand industry? It is no secret that we enjoy a pampered<br />\nposition in the world economic order and that our<br />\ninterests, more precisely, those of our large corporations.<br />\nare contrary to those of most developing nations. If there<br />\nis reconciliation to be made on our part, it will be painful<br />\nand expensive.<br />\nFinally. Mr. Carter's stand on the human rights issue is<br />\nadmirable and righteous, but today it is not realistic for<br />\nany country to hope to produce real change in this area.<br />\nAt best, progress will be piecemeal and contingent on<br />\npeaceful conditions in all parts of the globe as well as<br />\ngreater prosperity. But this is also an issue that Mr. Carter<br />\nviews incorrectly on a global scale. He stated that \"The<br />\nUnited Nations is the global forum dedicated to the peace<br />\nand well-being of every individual\u2014no matter how weak<br />\nor how poor.\" Unfortunately, this is just not true. The<br />\nUnited Nations was established as a forum of equality<br />\namong nations, principal among its tenets was that of<br />\nuncontested sovereignity 'of each member over its<br />\npopulation, territory and judicial system or regime. Of<br />\ncourse, members are expected to uphold certain basic<br />\nrights as concerns their citizens but there is no mechanism<br />\nto assure compliance. Suspension or withdrawal of<br />\nmembership from the United Nations is a solution that<br />\nhas not yet been considered.<br />\nIn brief, idealism in foreign policy is a necessary and<br />\ndesirable development for this country, and Mr. Carter is<br />\na man that could best steer a path towards harmony and<br />\nequality in the world if that were possible. Unfortunately<br />\nhis greatest task in formulating America's foreign policy<br />\nwill be his ability to combine his idealism with the realism<br />\nof the world as it exists today<br />\n<br />\n\fmarch 22, 1977/news-letter/page 5<br />\n<br />\nclassifieds'<br />\nSPANISH by experienced native<br />\nteachers - All levels, all ages.<br />\n366-2056.<br />\n<br />\nAn Evening of<br />\nWhole Earth Music<br />\n<br />\nHAVE A PIZZA BEFORE YOU<br />\nGO TO FLORIDA ENJOY A 1/2<br />\nPRICE PIZZA IN THE RAT.<br />\n3-22-77 7:30 - 12:30 WITH THIS<br />\nAD.

Well, to the averge Joe Doe inf<br />\nAnytown, USA, Hungary is a dirty country where ale<br />\npeople (pardon the expression) spend their lives stealing<br />\nchickens, stirring goulash, and kidnapping the children of<br />\nTransylvanian nobles.<br />\nFew realize the historical and cultural importance of<br />\nHungary. Even fewer care. For example, I wager my first<br />\nborn not many of you know (or even suspect) that<br />\nbetween the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of<br />\nthe Industrial Era, it was Hungary that kept the red lights<br />\nof prostitution burning throughout central Europe. Under<br />\nUlaslo II, King of Bohemia, the Hungarians developed a<br />\nrace of uberfraus bred for their sexual prowess and ability<br />\nto roll a client. Indeed, the only remaining members of<br />\nthis race are the Gabors.<br />\nGetting back to the point, St. Ladislaus was not<br />\nimportant to just Hungary; he wasn't important to the<br />\nrest of Europe either. His ill-fated conversion of Hungary<br />\nto Hare Krishna in 1267 was the highlight of Clement II's<br />\nbrief tenure as Pope. Upon learning of Laddie's (as his<br />\nfriends called him) actions, the aged rou-e' of Rome issued<br />\na doctrine placing an unreasonable tariff on parika and<br />\nformally making Hungarians third-class citizens, with only<br />\nthe French and Irish below in the hiergrchy. This was too<br />\nmuch for the happy-go-lucky gypsies, so they banished St.<br />\nLaddie. Eventually he found his way .to the New World<br />\nwhere he performed<br />\nthe three miracles to earn his<br />\nsainthood; he lived ten years each in Scranton, New<br />\nBrunswick, and Perth Amboy. Some people talk about<br />\nchanging wine to water or making the blind see, but<br />\nsurvive a summer in Perth Amboy and you'll know what a<br />\nreal miracle is.<br />\nAnd what about Hungarian literature?

Portraits of past<br />\nHopkins<br />\nfaculty gaze down on unwary students; like<br />\nHamlet's<br />\nghost, these images from the past remind studen<br />\nts of their<br />\n<br />\nother Hopkins students struggling through the same<br />\nOrganic Chem problems or trying to memorize the same<br />\n300 names for an American Political Thought exam.<br />\nThe Hutzler regulars can be divided into several groups.<br />\nPerhaps the most obvious classification here is the<br />\ndistinction between smokers and non-smokers. Smokers<br />\nare restricted to Hutzler's North Wind and are generally<br />\nmore rowdy than the non-smokers.<br />\nThe \"jokers\" constitute a significant segment of the<br />\nHutzler regulars. These Hopkins uridergrads climb the<br />\nscaffolds present in the Hut for repairs, lead the steaks,<br />\nand participate in the fraternity initiations at the Hut. In<br />\nthis way, Hutzler represents the levity of Hopkins, for it is<br />\na place to laugh, to enjoy oneself.<br />\nThe \"minglers\" are closely akin to the jokers,for they<br />\nenjoy the lighter side of Hutzler. The minglers check out<br />\nthe social scene at the Hut, discourse on the perilous state<br />\nof affairs at Hopkins and in the world, and then go home<br />\n<br />\nThis is my cow<br />\nI want her now<br />\n<br />\nElsie is mine<br />\nAnd drinks fine wine<br />\nThese are of course, Sipos' famous \"veal couplets.\"<br />\nHere, in America, though, the average Hungarian is<br />\ncharacterized as a heavy drinking gypsy, who is poor,<br />\nsuspicious, and ready to kill over a chicken. And that's<br />\nperfectl y true. Take a Hungarian out of his homeland and<br />\nhe becomes a completely different person. He becomes an<br />\noutcast relegated to the inner core of blighted urban<br />\nareas, denied the opportunity for a good job and<br />\neducation. The average Hungarian-American is little better<br />\noff than the average Mick.<br />\nI know the words to the \"Hungarian Rhapsody\" and<br />\nthey do not portend good fortune for chauvinists like<br />\nyou, McConsaidin. The lyrics tell of a gypsy boy of a<br />\nhumble background who rises through the ranks to be<br />\nKing of the Gypsies. And through a series of remarkable<br />\nevents, he eventually becomes Emperor of the World, The<br />\nExalted Ruler, The Grand Poobah of us all. Only in<br />\nAmerica, as Jay and the Americans would have it, could a<br />\npoor boy like me become The Grand Poobah. And when<br />\nthat 'happens, McConsaidin, you'd better be on the first<br />\npotato boat back to County Cork.

Unlike the sterilt<br />\ncinderblock construction of the Eisenhower Library<br />\nHutzler has a personality all its own. The huge Corint<br />\nhian<br />\npillars and the tall stained glass windows are<br />\nof an<br />\narchitectural style long since eclipsed by square,<br />\nlifeless<br />\n,construction.<br />\nHutzler, the original JHU library, represents Hopkin<br />\ns<br />\npast and present. The acoustics of the Hutzle<br />\nr Room sitting in the central rotunda allows One to hear<br />\nwhispers<br />\nat the other end of the room - are clearly<br />\nfrom a time<br />\npast, when less refined building methods were<br />\nused. Yet<br />\nHutzler represents the present at Hopkins,<br />\nfor its vast<br />\nperiodical collection allows undergraduates<br />\nto keep in<br />\ntouch with the contemporary outside world.<br />\nMany Hopkins students are Hutzler \"regul<br />\nars\" - these<br />\nstudents find the Hut the place to study. But<br />\nHutzler is<br />\nmore than just a room to study in; it is a<br />\nplace to meet<br />\n<br />\nto study.<br />\nThe \"sleepers\" are the last major group of Hutzler<br />\nregulars. These individuals curl up on the sofas for three<br />\nhours a night, only to be rudely awakened at 7 am by the<br />\ncleaning woman, yelling, \"What do you think this is, a<br />\nhotel?\"<br />\nHutzler is administered by two full-time librarians,<br />\nassisted by eight student assistants and security<br />\npersonnnel. The librarians assist students in locating<br />\nmaterials contained in Hutzler's collection of about 5000<br />\ntomes, and devise projects to keep the student assistants<br />\noccupied. Security personnel cover the Hutzler desk<br />\nfrom<br />\nmidnight to 8 am.<br />\nHutzler is more than just an undergraduate study-hall;<br />\nit is a manifestation of the University. If nothing else,<br />\nthe<br />\nfriendships formed at the Hut and the memories of the<br />\nlong hours spent there will be remembered fondly by the<br />\nHutzler re.ulars long after they leave Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\n\fIs wrestling<br />\nart or sham.<br />\nBy DEBI KIBLER<br />\nBallet.

President Ford was quoted as<br />\nsaying: \"Dr. Know helped me fudge the Warren Report.\"<br />\n\"Dr. Know helped me through college,\" Sen. Ted<br />\nKennedy was quoted as saying.<br />\nBruce and Marty are both graduates of the University<br />\nof Michigan where they each won Hopwood awards in<br />\nWining. They had come to Boulder in the summer, and<br />\nstarted the Dr. Know service about two months before<br />\ntheir arrest, as a way of paying rent and expressing what<br />\nMarty called \"our serious political views on various<br />\nissues.\"<br />\nQUESTION: Why did you start this business of writing<br />\nPapers for people?<br />\nBRUCE: Well, actually we were strapped for dollars.<br />\nFinancially embarassed, you might say. Both of us are<br />\nwriters, working with both fiction and fact, and generally<br />\nhaving a hard time making money in this field, which is<br />\nno surprise. We formed the agency one morning over<br />\nbreakfast, advertised with posters, and did typing and<br />\nediting jobs in addition to writing a few papers each.<br />\nQ: How much did you charge?<br />\nB: Generally three to five dollars per page for an<br />\noriginal assignment. We had no files. Everything was done<br />\nfrom scratch. When you broke it down, it didn't come out<br />\nSO good per hour. But as non-alien<br />\nated labor, when you<br />\n<br />\ncould work on something you -were interested in, it Was a<br />\ngood deal.<br />\nQ: What of students used the service?<br />\nB: Students who didn't have the time or just weren't<br />\ninterested in the subject. Almost all of them could have<br />\nwritten the paper themselves, but just didn't want to. If a<br />\nstudent comes to college to learn, he will. In some cases,<br />\nhowever, students who had us write papers for them<br />\nactually got turned on to the subject matter, since he<br />\nor<br />\nshe had to read the paper and understand it before<br />\nturning it in.<br />\nMARTY: As a matter of fact, one guy who never<br />\nheard<br />\nof Walt Whitman is now reading the complete Leaves of<br />\nGrass. And the paper for which we were busted was<br />\ndescribed as \"fantastic\" by the undercover officer who<br />\narrested us.<br />\nQ: Did you ever consider that what you were doing was<br />\n\"Almost all of them could have written the paper<br />\nthemselves, but just didn't want to. If a student<br />\ncomes to college to learn, he will.\"<br />\nwrong?<br />\nB: Strictly from the legal angle, no. The University<br />\nnever warned us that what we were doing was not legal. It<br />\nturns out there is a statute, as we found out. I was<br />\ncharged with a class one misdemeanor which could be a<br />\n$1000 fine and six months in jail.<br />\nM: I don't feel like a criminal, but I guess these days<br />\nyou never know. The whole environment, as I see it, is<br />\nmorally ambiguous. For example, information was<br />\nrevealed recently that the Army had released a pathogenic<br />\ngerm warfare bacillus on the New York subway to run<br />\n\"vulnerability tests.\" Who supports and is responsible for<br />\nsuch developments? The main culprit is the University,<br />\nwhich has been doing top-secret research in this area for<br />\nyears. In comparison, we were very open about what we<br />\nwere doing. We put our house phone number on all the<br />\n<br />\nposters. Unlike classified research done by intelligence<br />\nagencies, universities, and the military, our files and<br />\nresearch are open to everyone at all times. All information<br />\nto the people; that could be our slogan.<br />\nQ: Are you worried at this time about the charges?<br />\nB: Well, no one wants to be made an example of, which<br />\nsometimes happens in these cases. Ghostwriting, though,<br />\nis something that appears before us in speechwriting,<br />\nnewswriting, pen-names, CIA reports, and anonymous<br />\nsubversive leaflets. It's everywhere. Do you think Nixon<br />\nactually ever wrote or believed anything he spewed out<br />\nover the TV waves to catatonic millions?<br />\nM: At least we have a sense of humor, which is more<br />\nthan we can say for most political speech-writers, except<br />\npossibly Robert Dole's.<br />\nQ: Most people hate writing papers. Why did you pick<br />\nthis as your job?<br />\nB: This is basically what we know how to do. And, by<br />\npicking papers to Write which were relevant to the species<br />\ncrisis which confronts us collectively as members of the<br />\nhuman group, we were able to sharpen our own ideas on<br />\nthese matters. For instance, in our papers we took stands<br />\naginst the American Medical Association,. multinational<br />\ncorporations, outer space colonization, recombinant DNA<br />\nresearch, forced drug therapy in mental institutions, and<br />\nthe findings of the Warren Co: imission.<br />\nQ: Now that Dr. Know is being laid rests, are either of<br />\nyou considering going back to school to write your own<br />\npapers? If you could guarantee an A or B or refund half<br />\nthe money if the paper received a lower grade, you must<br />\nbe somewhat academically oriented.<br />\nM: Something about the grading system and the<br />\nbureaucracy which creates competition as an end in itself<br />\nis basically repugnant to both of us. Before the University<br />\nbecame a corporation, it was customary for the young<br />\nman to go into the Army. Now he is enrolled in college.<br />\nAfter four years as an undergrad, I'm not surt there's<br />\nmuch difference, although I don't iTmembe; killing<br />\nanyone.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8/news-letter/march 22,1977<br />\n<br />\nird1/4/40211211/%211W/Caral<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\nWEDNESDAY NOON SERIES<br />\npresented by<br />\nThe Office of Special Events<br />\n<br />\nSTUDY IN NEW YORK<br />\nTHIS SUMMER Columbia<br />\nUniversity offers over 400<br />\nundergraduate and<br />\nprofessional school<br />\ncourses.

There is a legend that still survives<br />\namong team members about the sophomore golfer who<br />\nwent to a past athletic director and complained, \"We<br />\ndon't get enough exposure or publicity. Nobody listens to<br />\nus.\" The athletic director said,\"Next!\"<br />\nCompared to lacrosse players, golfers seem like the 99<br />\nlb. weaklings whose face you kicked sand into last<br />\nsummer. Fallacious notions abound among the ignorant<br />\nthat golfers are in some way inferior sissified beings.<br />\nThat's completely false; golfers have taken more of their<br />\nshare of the local honeys behind the gasworks to watch<br />\nthe submarine races. And contrary to popular belief,<br />\ngolers use every muscle in their body to generate a<br />\nclubhead speed of more than 150 miles per hour.<br />\n\"Golf provides an occasional escape from the pressure<br />\nof Hopkins academics,\" clains Win Smith, aimable mentor<br />\nof the Blue Jay squad. \"In golf there's a certain<br />\ninteraction between man and nature, and between man<br />\nand himself. Golf is also a game that requires great<br />\nphysical strength and coordination, but even more<br />\nimportantly, coordination between mind and body.\"<br />\nLast year the Hopkins golf team struggled to a dismal<br />\nrecord nobody seems to remember. Competition against<br />\nDivision I schools, illness, academics, and a lack of team<br />\nmembers all contributed to the unfortunate downfall.<br />\nHowever, this year's team suffers from none of these<br />\nand, according Smith, a Hopkins graduate himself, has<br />\ngreat potential. \"We're looking forward to placing in the<br />\nMAC Championship and to possibly win a berth in the<br />\nNCAA Division III finals. I feel the talent to do this exists<br />\namong the guys on the team.\"<br />\nReturning lettermen include junior Captain Mike Deak,<br />\nand sophomores Pat Caruso and Barclay Knapp. .<br />\n<br />\nAcademic pressure has prompted the early retirement of<br />\nsweetswinging senior Joe Arminio. But Smith does not<br />\ndespair.<br />\n\"We have a number of fine fresh young players,\" the<br />\ncoach explained, \"so Joe's presence will not really be<br />\nmissed.\"<br />\nSpearheading the newcomers are freshmen Dave<br />\nDeSmith, Jeff Ferris, Alan Wormser, Carlos Sera, Teddy<br />\nFirestone, and transferee Michel Krug. \"I'm pleased with<br />\nthe enthusiasm they have shown,\" the coach boasted, \"I<br />\nthink this is the nucleus for a powerhouse of Hopkins golf<br />\nin the future.\"<br />\nThe highlight of the year so far has been Dave<br />\nDeSmith's hole-in-one last Saturday during the annual<br />\nintra-squad Spring Tournament at Mount Pleasant Golf<br />\n<br />\n4111111141410\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u202200110<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCourse. On the 140 yard par three sixth hole, the smooth<br />\nswinging youngster from West Simsbury, Connecticut<br />\nlanced a nine iron into a gusty wind and the hole.<br />\nDe Smith was so shaken by this he proceeded to<br />\ntriple-bogey the next hole but settled down to fire a<br />\nround of 83 which placed third to the winning 78 posted<br />\nby Captain Deak. Finishing second in the tournament was<br />\nMinnesotean Krug whose game, the coach added, \"is like<br />\na piece of taffy.\"<br />\nNext week the Hopkins linksters will travel to<br />\nFlorence, South % Carolina for a special training camp<br />\ndevised by Coach Smith.<br />\n\"The Carolina trip provides us a good chance to get a<br />\nhead start on our competition,\" Smith said, \"also, it will<br />\ngive us an opportunity to get our games in good shape.\"<br />\n<br />\nONE WEEK AIR CHARTERS FROM<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBALTIMORE/WASHINGTON INTERNATIONAL<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCALIFORNIA<br />\n$229 ty<br />\nFrom<br />\n<br />\nPer Person \u2014 Air &fly<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nNON-STOP VIA AMERICAN AIRLINES<br />\nDepartures July 8 & August 5<br />\n<br />\n\\ Sol\"<br />\n<br />\n\u20185 IX111<br />\n<br />\nCHARGE TICKETS<br />\nBY TELEPHONE WITH<br />\nYOUR CREDIT CARD.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 ALSO AVAILABLE<br />\n<br />\nPhone(301)727-4103<br />\nTckets available at<br />\nall licketron outlets.<br />\n<br />\n41 We have special reduced hotel and rent-a-car<br />\nrates<br />\n\u2022 that you can- plan your own California vacation in any so<br />\nof<br />\n\u2022 thirteen great California cities.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nalAcingest<br />\n11\"<br />\nhe a<br />\nin t<br />\now<br />\nsh<br />\n01<br />\n3,11<br />\n<br />\nThe low price includes round . trip jet transportation.<br />\n\u2022 appropriate meals and drinks aloft and air taxes.

Myrick, a four year starter from Towson, led all<br />\ngoal scorers with four in addition to picking up a lone<br />\nassist, while DeSimone, a Long Island product who<br />\ntransferred to JHU after being an All-American two years<br />\nago at Navy, chipped in with three goals and two assists.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that Myrick led all Jay<br />\nmidfielders in scoring a year ago, although he had only 23<br />\npoints for the entire season!<br />\nHopkins, behind Myrick's sharpshooting, broke on top<br />\nquickly against the visitors from Connecticut and never<br />\ntrailed. The Jays gained control of the opening draw and<br />\nforty-four seconds later, Myrick notched his first goal<br />\nwith an assist to Mike O'Neill and JHU led 1-0. Less than<br />\na minute later, the Jays grabbed a 2-0 advantage, as<br />\nDeSimone fed Myrick for the game's second goal.<br />\nYale closed the gap to 2-1, as the Bulldogs took<br />\nadvantage of an extra-man situation created when a JHU<br />\ndefender was penalized. However, JHU retaliated quickly<br />\nwith DeSimone firing a pair of unassisted goals past the<br />\nhelpless Yale goalie to give the Jays a 4-1 lead with five<br />\nminutes still left in the opening period.<br />\nYale capitalized on the extra-man advantage once again<br />\nto bring the count to 4-2, but Blue Jay sophmore<br />\nmidfielder Dave Huntley fired home a shot to culminate a<br />\nfast break and Hopkins led 5-2.<br />\nYale closed out the first period scoring with yet anther<br />\nextra-man situation goal. With Hopkins being penalized<br />\nfairly often and the visitors apparent ability to score with<br />\nthe man advantage, it appeared as though perhaps Yale<br />\nwould be able to hang close.<br />\nHowever, the Blue Jay defense did an abrupt about<br />\nface following their lackluster first period performance.<br />\n<br />\nThey totally disengaged the Bulldog offensive machinery ,<br />\nshutting out Yale for almost three-quarters of the game.<br />\nMost impressive was the fact that the visitors had eight<br />\nmore man-advantage situatiohs in the game, but the<br />\nyoung Jay defense allowed nb goals as the result of the<br />\nadvantage.<br />\nWhereas the defense improv'ed immeasurably during the<br />\nsecond period, the offense began to slow down. Freshman<br />\nJon Swerdloff and Myrick ware the only goal scorers in<br />\nthe quarter, giving JHU a 7-3 halftime lead.<br />\nThe opening minutes of the second half were<br />\nmarked by some sloppy play on both sides, but the Jays<br />\nquickly regained their composure and the offense began<br />\nto reassert itself.<br />\n'Within a two minute time span, O'Neill, Rich Hirsch<br />\nand DeSimone pumped the ball past the Bulldog goalie to<br />\ngive Hopkins a commanding 10-3 lead. Senior midfielder<br />\nGeorge Johnson scored the first of his two goals late in<br />\nthe quarter to give JHU an 11-3 advantage after forty-five<br />\nminutes of play.<br />\nThe large lead gave Hopkins coach Henry Ciccarone a<br />\nchance to rest his starters on attack and defense in the<br />\nfinal period and to let younger players receive valuable<br />\ngame experience. The tempo of the game, however, did<br />\nnot change as Hopkins continued total domination at<br />\nboth ends of the field. The defense, led by freshman<br />\ngoalie Mike Federico (in for starter Kevin Mahon),<br />\ncontnued the excellent play, allowing Yale only one goal<br />\nand that coming with fifteen seconds remaining in the<br />\ncontest.<br />\nThe offense was sparked by Swerdloff. The first year<br />\nplayer from Baltimore added two goals giving him four<br />\npoints in his first game. Myrick and Johnson also scored<br />\nto bring the final count to 15-4.<br />\nAfter the game, Ciccarone noted that the scoring from<br />\nthe midfield has a continuation of a trend set in<br />\nscrimmages and was not surprised.<br />\n\"We have much more balance on offense this year,\" the<br />\nCoach explained. \"In the past, we've been much more<br />\nattack oriented. People are so conscious of(Mike)O'Neill<br />\nthat he'll probably be getting more assists this season.\"<br />\nCiccarone added that he was \"disappointed\" that the<br />\n<br />\ndefense had given up three extra-man goals in the first<br />\nperiod. He said that the team had been working on this<br />\nand that they went over this at halftime.<br />\n\"We weren't anticipating enough,\" Ciccarone added.<br />\nThe Jays swing back into action next Saturday as they<br />\ntravel up the road to meet Division II power Towson<br />\nState. Other games during the vacation will include<br />\nWashington College (3/29) and Princeton (4/2).<br />\n<br />\nSwimmers win NCAA Division III championship<br />\nThe Hopkins men's varsity swim team spent the past<br />\nweekend in Ohio doing something that only lacrosse<br />\nteams are supposed to accomplish at JHU- winning a<br />\nnational championship.<br />\nPaced by freshman Bill Smiddy and sophomore Mike<br />\nBay, the Blue Jay aquamen swam away from the rest of<br />\nthe field as they captured the third annual NCAA Division<br />\nSwimming and Diving championships. The Jays amassed<br />\n272 points for the three day competition, leaving<br />\nrunner-up Occidental (Calif.) College (198 points) and<br />\nthird place Kenyon (Ohio) College (172) floundering in<br />\nthe Blue Jay wake.<br />\nFor the swimmers of Head Coach Frank Comfort, the<br />\nchampionship marked the end of several years of<br />\nfrustration. In the previous two national meets, the Jays<br />\nhad finished second and, according to Comfort, he<br />\n\"couldn't have imagined finishing second again.\"<br />\nSmiddy and Bay prgvided much of the impetus for the<br />\nvictory. The<br />\nduo combined for five individual<br />\nchampionships- two of wmcn\u2022 were in national record<br />\nbreaking time.<br />\nBill, a 'first year competitor from Wilmington,<br />\nDelaware, was the meet's lone triple winner, capturing<br />\nfirst place in the 200-yard individual medley, the<br />\n100-yard breaststroke, and the 200-yeard breaststroke.<br />\nHis performance in the 100-yard breaststroke was a new<br />\nnational Division III standard, while his times in the other<br />\nraces established new University records.<br />\nA triple winner a year ago, Mike captured first place<br />\nhonors in a pair of events this year. He outdistanced the<br />\nfield in a pair of events this year. He outdistanced the<br />\nfield in the 400-yard individual medley (for a new<br />\nnational record) and the 200-yard backstroke, while also<br />\nfinishing fourth to teammate Smiddy in the 200-yard<br />\nindiviudal medley.<br />\nThe first day of the competition was Thursday and the<br />\nend of that session saw the Jays and Occidental tied for<br />\nthe overall team lead with 69 points apiece. In addition to<br />\nthe one-four\"placing of Smiddy and Bay in the 200-IM on<br />\nthat day, JHU also got points from DiCio (second in the<br />\none meter diving event), Tim Collins (eighth in the 500<br />\nyard freestyle) and a third place finish from the 400 yard<br />\nmedley relay team of Smiddy, Bay, Sam Taylor, and Roy<br />\nBeveridge.<br />\n<br />\nWas this where Comfort had hoped to be after the<br />\nopening day- in a tie for first?<br />\n\"I didn't know what to expect on the first day,\" the<br />\nCoach explained. \"On the second day, however, I had<br />\nhoped to be up by at least 15 points.\"<br />\nThe close of competition on Friday showed that<br />\nComfort had gotten his wish, with some to spare. The<br />\nJays held a 29 point lead over Occidental, 156-127, after<br />\ntwo days of swimming.<br />\nBoth Bay and Smiddy had captured individual titles on<br />\nFriday. Bay had won the 400 yard IM while Smiddy had<br />\nled an incredible Hopkins performance in the 100-yard<br />\nbreaststroke.<br />\nThe breaststroke events had been a Blue Jay strength<br />\nthroughout the entire season and the national meet<br />\nsimply reaffirmed this fact.,In addition to Smiddy's first<br />\nplace finish, JHU swimmers Brian Kutsunai (4th), Bill<br />\nSick (5th), Rick Goodale (8th) and Dean Buchenauer<br />\n(9th) added points to the JHU total through their efforts<br />\nin this event.<br />\nOther point scorers on Friday included co-captain John<br />\nDierkes(7th in the 100-yard backstroke) and a sixth place<br />\nfinish from the'800-yard free relay team.<br />\nSaturday's competiton saw the Jays pull even farther<br />\naway from the rest of the pack. Hopkins had three<br />\nindiviudal winners- Smiddy in the 200-breaststroke, Bay<br />\nin the 200-backstroke and co-captain Mark Tohir in the<br />\n3-meter diving- in addition to a bevy of other performers<br />\nwho finished in the top twelve of their event and<br />\ntherefore increased the Jay point total.<br />\nSmiddy once again led an excellent performance in the<br />\nbreaststroke event. Kutsunai, Buchenauer, Goodale and<br />\nSick all finished in the final twelve of this event, giving<br />\nthe JHU breaststroke team a total of over 90 points for<br />\nthe meet- a performance that would have ranked them as<br />\nthe 8th best over-all team in the meet!<br />\nKutsunai, a freshman from Honolulu, Hawaii, proved<br />\nto be the team's number three swimmer at the<br />\nchampionships. He has given .outstanding performances<br />\nthroughout the season ,and carne on to be an excellent<br />\nnational competitor.<br />\nDierkes followed teammate Bay with a sixth place<br />\nfinish in the 200-backstroke, while DiCio backed up Tohir<br />\nby coming in fourth in the diving.<br />\n<br />\nOther point scorers on the final day of competition<br />\nwe re Collins and Mike McNamara (4th and 12th<br />\nrespectively in the 1650-yard freestyle), Sam Taylor's<br />\neleventh olace effort in the- 220-yard butterfly and a<br />\nsimilar finish from the 400-yard free relay team.<br />\nComfort was obviously ecs,tatic concerning his team's<br />\nperformance.<br />\n\"We swam,extremely well,\" the Coach proclaimed. \"It<br />\nwas just a fan'tastic meet.<br />\n\"We have an awful lot of depth. The other teams didn't<br />\nhave the depth to swim with us. You need the big guys,<br />\nlike Bay and Smiddy, to carry you, but you have to have<br />\nthe depth to win it.\"<br />\n<br />\nFencers come<br />\nFollowing a somewhat disappointing performance in<br />\nthe MAC championship the Blue Jay men's varsity fencing<br />\nteam traveled to Penn State on March 12th to participate<br />\nin the North Atlantic Championships.<br />\nPer forming with a fully recovered team (several<br />\nmembers had been ill for the MAC's), Hopkins fenced<br />\nextremely well and took second place, trailing only host<br />\nPenn State by eight.<br />\nThe foil, epee and sabre teams each finished second in<br />\ntheir respective divisions and the three-way victory total<br />\nof 57 established JHU as one of the best teams in the<br />\nEast.<br />\nFor JHU, Dave Grabatak and co-captain Frank<br />\nMurabito worked in the epee category. Both compiled<br />\nrecords of 9-3, Grabarek on the A strip and Murabito on<br />\nthe B strip.<br />\nIn the Sabre division, Frank Burton fenced on the A<br />\nstrip while Eric Cordts competed on the B strip. Burton<br />\nmatched his epee teammates, establishing a 9-3 record,<br />\nwhile Cordts led the entire B field, compiling an 11-1<br />\nmark.<br />\nEric Newman and co-captain Dave Bell were the<br />\nHomewood competitors bn the foil mats. Newman fenced<br />\non A strip and finished with a creditable 8-4 record, while<br />\nBell matched Cordts with an 11-1 performance.<br />\nThe final competition for the Jays will be the NCAA<br />\nchampionships held later this month at Notre Dame<br />\n<br />\n\fIn the course of h istory at any great university<br />\n(for this article, assume<br />\nHopkins is such)<br />\nthere are likely to occur certain moments which<br />\nwill forever linger in the collective consciousness<br />\nof the participants, moments that are logically<br />\nremembered over after-dinner brandies as<br />\n\"unforgettable.\" For some it may be that instant<br />\nof glory after scoring the winning goal in a<br />\nlacrosse game, while for others it may be that<br />\nsudden and unexpected revelation in the<br />\nchemistry lab and, a mad dash down Charles<br />\nStreet shouting \"Eureka!\"<br />\nF or most, though,. these \"unforgettable\"<br />\nmoments arc less than traumatic and often take<br />\nfarcical forms, like the times the guys over at<br />\nDelta Delta gave Charlie Feeney a hot foot or<br />\nwhen Binky Chesterfield- realized his jockey<br />\nshorts were filled with shaving cream. I know I<br />\nwill never forget when a freshman chum of mine<br />\n(who has since died and gone to Hofstra) flicked<br />\nhis cigarette ashes in some girl's hair to impress us<br />\nwith his uncouthness. Of course some of these<br />\npersonal epophanies are not that frivolous or<br />\npublic; usually they're quite dramatic and happen<br />\nwhen you're alone. And for the rest of your life,<br />\n<br />\nmy head was a ghasty Burma Shave jingle--My job is keeping<br />\nFaces clean<br />\nAnd nobody knows<br />\nDe stubble I've seen.<br />\n<br />\nI was, as one of my students apologizes, all burnt<br />\nout.<br />\nEvery poet has his earthly nemesis. Mine was<br />\n<br />\nMoose jerke.ns, an ex-Marine doubling as my<br />\nroommate. He persistently chided me because I<br />\nwould wait until after lights out to change into<br />\nmy Dr. Dentons.- Mo9se spread the malicious<br />\nrumour throughout th'e dorm that I possessed \"A<br />\ndisposition slightly less than that of the average<br />\nJoe, if you know what I mean.\" I had always<br />\nthought my somewhat delicate constitution was<br />\nconsistent with my role as the next Housman, and<br />\nI never presumed my sexual affiliation would be<br />\nquestioned, especially in a multiple choice exam.<br />\nThe craze about my reputed \"deformity\"<br />\nquietly died, but still there was the problem of<br />\nliving with Moose. Asked why he left the Marines,<br />\n<br />\neyes in marriage to that old hag of an academic.<br />\nHer eyes were like jasmine zircons floating in<br />\nlimpid pools of moonlight and her laughtef<br />\ntwinkled like champagne glasses cascading down a<br />\ncarpeted staircase. Head over heels in love I must<br />\nhave been for [tripped on the welcome mat and<br />\nfound myself face to face with her left ankle.<br />\n\"You like my ankle?\" she chirped.<br />\n\"I have my mind on higher things,\" I replied<br />\nwithout thinking.<br />\nLuckily Professor Gompers appeared and led<br />\nthe way into the drawing room. \"Nothing<br />\nstronger than Ceylon Breakfast for me,\" the<br />\nprofessor said choosing his tea, \"I remember the<br />\ntime we were staying with some friends in<br />\nFlorence- and somehow they tricked me into<br />\nhaving 'three cups of Darjeering.

Otley, a '57 graduate of Hopkins, now<br />\nteaches English at a prep school in New England,<br />\na position where he can insulate himself from the<br />\ntraumas of the past. By nature, he's a rather<br />\nmelancholy spirit subject to frequent funks<br />\nwhich, I suspect, were the breeding grounds for<br />\nthis confession. I was so overwhelmed after<br />\nreading the letter I immediately called<br />\nlong-distance for his permission to reprint it. He<br />\nagreed on the grounds that I \"tactfully\" change<br />\nall the names, including his. \"Ghosts can read,\"<br />\nhe warned.<br />\nSo, a fanfare, please professor, here itis:<br />\nEver since A.E.

How do you view your<br />\nchances in the election?<br />\n2. What do you see as the<br />\nmajor issue in the campaign?<br />\n3. What do you think of the<br />\nNews-Letter's role on campus?<br />\n4. Where are you going on<br />\nyour spring vacation;<br />\n5. What is the first action you<br />\nwould take if and when you<br />\nassume office?<br />\n6. What do you see in this ink<br />\nblot? (see above)<br />\n7.

And he's made other moves<br />\nlike---well, he was inviting flak by awarding Princess<br />\nAshraff an honorary degree. With regard to final<br />\naccomplishments, I think again he has not done anything<br />\noutstanding one way or the other. Luckily.<br />\nStuart Davidson<br />\n1. I think they're good. But I'm taking nothing fot<br />\ngranted. Each election is a new one. I believe I have the<br />\nmomentum, but momentum isn't votes.<br />\n2. There is no \"single\" major issue if you can<br />\ncharacterize the campaign. I'm afraid it would concern<br />\nthe plight of the undergraduate; undergraduate in equity<br />\nin housing, questionable financial aid practices, incredibly<br />\ndisorganized social calendar among others.<br />\n3. Potentially, and I emphasize potentially, the<br />\nNews-Letter has one of the most important roles as being<br />\nthe spokesman for students' needs, desires, and opinions.<br />\nThe News-Letter is a major source of information not<br />\nonly to students but to the administration, the faculty,<br />\nand the trustees. As such, the NewsfLetter has a certain<br /><br />\nresponsibility to take the lead in co-operation with \u2022<br />\nviable student government to press for student needs.<br />\n5. I plan to during the rest of this year to institute a<br />\ncomplete stud'y on the structure of the Student Council,<br />\nparticularly in the area of committee structure. And<br />\nhopefully through the summer, I'll be able with an<br />\nalready functioning Education Committee to review and<br />\nformulate realistic recommendations for a viable<br />\nintersession. Should I take office in September, I would<br />\nimmediately implement the plans developed over the<br />\nsummer and through the rest of this semester. Putting<br />\ntogether a workable social calendar (which has been<br />\nlacking in the past) will also be a major priority.<br />\n6. (laughs) You really want a serious answer? This is a<br />\nterrible question. If you were a psychiatrist, I would give<br />\nyou the answers you want.

In<br />\naddition to working on the Hopkins 400 admission<br />\nprogram, Molander was able to compile a list of<br />\nrecommendations, and made critical remarks on his boss,<br />\nDr. George Benton in the News-Letter.<br />\nLast year Molander started in September (15). This<br />\nYear the job was vacant until March and lack of time is<br />\nnow the new student assistant's main hindrance. What<br />\ncaused the delay? Benton was responsible, although<br />\nunintentionally.<br />\nDuring the summer. Benton was unwilling to retain the<br />\nPosition at all. \"I have always had questions about the<br />\nPosition,\" he stated, \"because my office doesn't interact<br />\nWith - students that much.\" Areas over which he presides,<br />\nsuch as the library, admissions, and the computer center,<br />\nall ahve advisory commiitees to function as liasons to the<br />\nStudent Council, he said.<br />\n\"The office has not been mirroring success in the<br />\npast,\" he continued. \"Eric Molander was in many ways a<br />\nbig help, but when you really look at what he did, it was<br />\nWith Larry Denton, not with my office.\"<br />\nBenton hoped not to continue the assistantship this<br />\nyear. During the fall, however, the Student Council, in the<br />\nperson of Steve Ponchak pleaded with him to reinstate<br />\nthe job. Finally, late in the semester, he agreed to<br />\n\"compromise\" and grant the position.<br />\nIt was determined that the selection of an assistant<br />\nwould be handled by the Council, with Benton reserving<br />\nthe right to veto any of the candidates selected., The<br />\nprocess could not begin, related Steve Lovejoy, chairman<br />\nof the Selections Committee, until after Intersession, so<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\npotential applicants could be informed. Two people were<br />\nselected to be interviewed by Benton, Koenigsberg and<br />\nSteve Simms, who was Molander's assistant last year. It<br />\ntook one week for the committee to make these<br />\nselections and have them ratified in full council. Then,for<br />\na week\u2014\"the crucial week\" according to Lovejoy, Benton<br />\nwas completely unavailable, and the candidates had to<br />\nwait until the next week to meet with Benton. \"I spoke<br />\nto him for 5 minutes, and he did not find me<br />\nobjectionable,\" recalled Koenigsberg. After another week,<br />\nthe final selection of Koenigsberg was announced.<br />\n\"There are two reasons why she can't accomplish<br />\nmuch,\" commented Jill Leukhardt, a Council member,<br />\nMolander's fiancee, and who has done considerable<br />\nresearch on the position. \"Time is short, of course. There<br />\nis also almost a lame duck feeling because there are not<br />\ngoing to be any major decisions made until Benton's<br />\nsuccessor takes over.\" (Benton is resigning, effective June<br />\n30).<br />\nKoenigsberg i\u00a7 aware of the handicaps under which she<br />\ntook the position. \"The biggest hitch is that Benton did<br />\nnot pick a person to do what I want to do,\" she stated.<br />\n\"They don't have to be paying someone to be Benton's<br />\nassistant to work on the Hopkins 400.\" She added, \"I<br />\ndon't have to do anything more than make a beginning.'<br />\nThe Hopkins 400 program is envisioned by Benton as<br />\none of her two major duties. It entails working cl9sely<br />\nwith Larry Denton, Academic Services Director, on the<br />\nreception of 400 top applicants for a visit to the<br />\nHomewoOd campus. It does not, properly speaking,<br />\nrequire coordination with Benton's office. This contact<br />\nwith Denton, rather than Benton, was precisely the paint<br />\non which Benton criticized his previous assistants.<br />\nBenton acknowledged that Koenigsberg will be in a<br />\ndifficult position. \"I think there are Some Constructive<br />\nthings she can do, but it's quite obvious that she can't do<br />\nwhat sht could have done if she had been here since last<br />\nfall. This is a time of year she must -work with Larry<br />\nDento. We really don't have a chance to give it (the<br />\nstudent assistantship) a fair trial this year.\"<br />\nWhat 'about next year? If Benton were continuing, he<br /><br />\nwould invite Koenigsberg back next year. He is resigning,<br />\nhowever, and he is planning to give his successor \"a<br />\nbackground of the position and what I think its strengths<br />\nand weaknesses are\u2014then, he'll just have to make up his<br />\nown mind.\" The new Student Council, too, will have to<br />\nendorse her.<br />\nIn the time she has left this year, Koenigsberg's primary<br />\nfunctions will be to work with the Hopkins 400 and to<br />\nserve as liason between the Vice President and the<br />\nStudent COuncil. It will be difficult, but necesiary, for her<br />\nto compile a list of achievements sufficient to enable her<br />\nto continue and accomplish something next year.<br />\n;Otherwise, the four year old job will probably be<br />\ndiscontinued as the new Vice-President starts off with a<br />\nclean slate.<br /><br />\nMerit scholarships scalded by Council<br />\nBy MICHEL STEVEN KRUG<br />\nThe number of merit scholarships for the ,1977-78<br />\nacademic year will be increased by 33 per cent, officials<br />\nfrom the Financial Aid office announced last week.<br />\nMembers of the Student Council, however have criticized<br />\nthe increase because the awards are not granted on the<br />\nbasis of financial need.<br />\nLarry Denton, Director of Academic Services, said $65<br />\nthousand will be available to students who qualify for the<br />\nawards on the basis of their academic excellence and<br />\noutstanding achievements in the social realm. Fifty $1<br />\nthousand scholarships were awarded this year. Merit<br />\n/ \u2022 scholarships are divided among the student body, but<br />\nt)..1 with particular emphasis to entering Freshmen. Denton<br />\nestimated that 25 to 30 entering freshmen will receive<br />\nmerit awards, while the other 35 awards are to be divided<br />\namong previous recipients who maintain an acceptable<br />\nlevel of academic performance to merit continuation of<br />\ntheir special grants. Approximately ten students will be<br />\nselected from eligible upperclassmen Who had received no<br />\nprior merit awards<br />\nVociferous Debate<br />\nmembers vociferously debated with<br />\nCouncil<br />\nStudent<br />\nDenton and Wayne Hood, Director of Financial Aid<br />\nduring their weekly meeting last Thursday evening, that<br />\ntoo many students will receive merit scholarships without<br />\nfinancial need. These opponents contend monies<br />\nmandated for merit scholarships should be delegated to<br />\nstudents through a system \\similar to the College<br />\nScholarshin Service (CSS). A family's income, their liquid<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\nand non-liquid assets, and their number of children are<br />\nfactors included in the CSS evaluation. .<br />\nBut Denton contends the CSS system is \"very<br />\nimprecise. It's a ranking device more than a needs analysis<br />\ntest.\" Many students mistakenly believe that reliance on<br />\nthe CSS system will send the money where it's most<br />\nneeded, but they're wrong, he said. Asked whether some<br />\nmerit scholarship recipients already had been endowed<br />\nwith sufficient financial support from their parents,<br />\nDenton said students whose parents have an income<br />\nexceeding $40 thousand a year are not eligible for merit<br />\nscholarships. \"There just aren't any on the list,\" he said.<br />\nBut Student Council further objected . to the very<br />\nnature of scholarships awarded on the basis of academic<br />\nprowess. \"Once we're admitted, students should be<br />\ntreated on an equal basis,\" Student Council member Jill<br />\nLeukhardt said. Denton, however, said \"I think private<br />\ninstitutions are in the business of awarding and promoting<br />\nacademic excellence. If there is a reason to exist as a<br />\nprivate institution, this is it. Most of the things we do<br />\naround here are done on the basis of achievement. It's the<br />\nway it is.\" Until 1960, scholarships were awarded oh a<br />\npurely academic scale. It was only the last fifteen years<br />\nwhen the emphasis was shifted to financial need, he<br />\nadded.<br />\nMerit scholarships are used as lures for prospective<br />\nfreshmen, but Denton denies that Hopkins makes a<br />\npractice of buying students. We try to put together the<br />\nbest possible package, offering scholarships, national<br />\ndirect student loans, and the work study program, he said.<br /><br />\npage 4/news-letter/march 22, 1977<br /><br />\nMcCollum -Pratt:<br />\nLife in Future?<br />\nBy GAYLE COHEN<br />\nThe McCollum.Pratt Institute, the biological research<br />\ndivision of the university, has been the site of recent<br />\ndiscoveries in the study of evolution and bioluminesence.<br />\nDr. Dennis Powers* studies of fish have led to inroads in<br />\nthe understanding of evolution. Poweft explained, \"We've<br />\nbeen able to show how fish adjust their metabolic<br />\nfunctions as the external environment changes.\" .Powers<br />\nfound that some species have genetic adaptations that<br />\nallow them to adjust to environment,s while related<br />\nspecies cannot.<br />\nPowers* . investigation centered on hemoglobin, the<br />\noxygen-carrying pigment in the blood. A reduction in the<br />\n6xygen in the environment would first be sensed in the<br />\nhemoglobin. He found that fish living in fast-moving<br />\nstreams have . a hemoglobin component. lacking in<br />\nslow-water fish, which enables them to continue to bind<br />\noxygen in the gills despite the rigorous exercise of<br />\nswimming in fast-moving waters. This observation has<br />\nimportant implications for the conflicting theories of<br />\nevolution\u2014survival of the fittest and random mutations.<br />\nDr. Howard Seliger, another McCollum-Pratt member,<br />\n;X working on marine ecology, especially as it pertains .to<br />\nthe Chesapeake Bay. His studies have led him to believe<br />\nthat the Bay is basically healthy, despite recent publicity<br />\nproclaiming the Bay's defects. Seliger said, \"The Bay is\u2014<br />\nnot as sick as they think. Our work is designed to say<br />\nsomething more than just that we're unhappy about<br />\nthings.\"<br />\nSeliger has also been studying bioluminescence, the<br />\nlight emitted by animals when they are disturbed. In<br />\nparticular, he has been studying the relationship between<br />\nmolecules that are in an excited, light-producing state,<br />\nand the production of mutations. Seliger explained,<br />\n\"We're measuring the chemical luminescense of<br />\ncarcinogens (cancer-producing agents). There seems to be<br />\na correlation between the chemuluminescents and the<br />\ncarcinogens. We're working on how these<br />\nchemically-formed, excited states produce light.\"<br />\nBesides their implications for the advance of science in<br />\ngeneral, the studies of Powers and Seliger reflect<br /><br />\ninnovations within the Institute itself. .<br />\nIt was founded in 1947 to study micronutrients,-but<br />\nthe Institute's work.now spans all facets of biology. The<br />\nInstitute broadened its scope to coincide with increases in<br />\nthe volume of scientific knowledge and the widening<br />\ninterests of its staff.<br />\nAnother change from the original set-up is<br />\nMcCollum-Pratt's close affiliation with the Biology<br />\nDepartment. According to Dr. William Harrington,<br />\nChairman of the Biology Department and<br />\nthe<br />\nMcCollum -Pratt Institute are tenuous. It<br />\n(McCollum-Pratt) is now an institution within an<br />\ninstit ution (the Biology Department).\" All ten of<br />\nMcCollum-Pratt's current members, also belong to the<br />\nfaculty of the Biology Department.<br />\nThe virtual merger of the two occurred in 1955 when<br />\nDr. William McElroy became chairman of the Biology<br />\nDepartment during his directorship of McCollum-Pratt.<br />\nThis has been a dual position ever since.<br />\nAs part of this closer consolidatio, .McCollum-Pratt<br />\nmoved into Mergenthaler Hall with the Biology<br /><br />\nDepartment. In adidtion to .the Mergenthaler facilities,<br />\nMcCollum -Pratt has retained its facilities in the<br />\nGreenhouse. The Greenhouse is \"where animals are bred<br />\nand held for various biological experimentation,\" said<br />\nHarrington, adding that McCollum-Pratt uses \"no<br />\ndogs\u2014only small rodents, such as rabbits, guinea pigs, and<br />\nmice.\"<br />\nMcCollum-Pratt also operates a field station on the<br />\nRhode River, five miles south of Annapolis. Seliger<br />\nexplained, \"The Rhode River facility is owned by the<br />\nSmithsonian Institute.

The emphasis of the speech was on<br />\ninternational harmony, a global economy, and human<br />\nrights. In each of these areas Mr. Carter proposed to work<br />\nwith all countries that are \"ready to work with us in<br />\npromoting global progress.\" Cooperation and assistance to<br />\nthose who need it underlie his 'new foreign policy.'<br />\nEarly in his speech, Mr. Carter realistically stated that<br />\n\"the United States cannot solve the problems of the<br />\nworld. We can sometimes help others resolve their<br />\ndifferences, but we cannot do so by imposing our own<br />\nparticular solutions.\" These words reflect the truth that<br />\nhas been long to arrive in American foreign policy. It is<br />\nthe epitaph of our last decade and a firm step toward<br />\n(educed American military involvement<br />\nabroad in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nLikewise, Mr. Carter's support of majority rule in<br />\nAfrica is a timely stand taken on an issue about to<br />\nexplode. His speech, though, offered no suggestions as to<br />\nwhat role the United States should play in bringing about<br />\nthe \"fundamental transformation\" in Rhodesia. Mr.<br />\nCarter is opposed to a \"protracted racial war\"(does this<br />\nexclude support for a quick, conclusive one?) and has<br />\nrecently signed a ban on the importation of chrome from<br />\nwhat has for the first time been spoken of as \"the illegal<br />\nregime in Rhodesia\".<br />\nIn some respects however, President Carter's idealism<br />\nmay be clouding his conception of the world as it exists in<br />\n1977 and as it will be for some time to come. This is<br />\nespecially true in such matters as the arms race, the<br />\nunderdeveloped nations and, Mr. Carter's favorite issue,<br />\nhuman rights in all nations. The arms reduction issue, a<br />\nmajor theme in his speech, is as old and as stubborn as<br />\never. The arms race has been the subject of international<br />\nconferences and treaties since the two World Wars, and<br />\ncuriously enough, the most heated discussion takes place<br />\nprior to times of war. The arms race has become the<br />\ncancer of international order, and proliferation will<br /><br />\n011\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\narticle by K.E.T.<br />\ngraphic by Stein<br />\nIMO<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\ncontinue until all countries have access to nuclear<br />\nweapons. After all, how can Mr. Carter speak of equality<br />\nand justice if the possession of these lethal weapons is<br />\nlimited and their use is confined to the members of an<br />\n'elitist' nuclear club?<br />\nIt is also in the spirit of cooperation that Mr. Carter<br />\nsuggests that developing countries \"must acquire fuller<br />\nparticipation in the global economic decision-making<br />\nprocess,\" but what will this.mean to American banking<br />\nand industry? It is no secret that we enjoy a pampered<br />\nposition in the world economic order and that our<br />\ninterests, more precisely, those of our large corporations.<br />\nare contrary to those of most developing nations. If there<br />\nis reconciliation to be made on our part, it will be painful<br />\nand expensive.<br />\nFinally. Mr. Carter's stand on the human rights issue is<br />\nadmirable and righteous, but today it is not realistic for<br />\nany country to hope to produce real change in this area.<br />\nAt best, progress will be piecemeal and contingent on<br />\npeaceful conditions in all parts of the globe as well as<br />\ngreater prosperity. But this is also an issue that Mr. Carter<br />\nviews incorrectly on a global scale. He stated that \"The<br />\nUnited Nations is the global forum dedicated to the peace<br />\nand well-being of every individual\u2014no matter how weak<br />\nor how poor.\" Unfortunately, this is just not true. The<br />\nUnited Nations was established as a forum of equality<br />\namong nations, principal among its tenets was that of<br />\nuncontested sovereignity 'of each member over its<br />\npopulation, territory and judicial system or regime. Of<br />\ncourse, members are expected to uphold certain basic<br />\nrights as concerns their citizens but there is no mechanism<br />\nto assure compliance. Suspension or withdrawal of<br />\nmembership from the United Nations is a solution that<br />\nhas not yet been considered.<br />\nIn brief, idealism in foreign policy is a necessary and<br />\ndesirable development for this country, and Mr. Carter is<br />\na man that could best steer a path towards harmony and<br />\nequality in the world if that were possible. Unfortunately<br />\nhis greatest task in formulating America's foreign policy<br />\nwill be his ability to combine his idealism with the realism<br />\nof the world as it exists today<br /><br />\nmarch 22, 1977/news-letter/page 5<br /><br />\nclassifieds'<br />\nSPANISH by experienced native<br />\nteachers - All levels, all ages.<br />\n366-2056.<br /><br />\nAn Evening of<br />\nWhole Earth Music<br /><br />\nHAVE A PIZZA BEFORE YOU<br />\nGO TO FLORIDA ENJOY A 1/2<br />\nPRICE PIZZA IN THE RAT.<br />\n3-22-77 7:30 - 12:30 WITH THIS<br />\nAD.

Well, to the averge Joe Doe inf<br />\nAnytown, USA, Hungary is a dirty country where ale<br />\npeople (pardon the expression) spend their lives stealing<br />\nchickens, stirring goulash, and kidnapping the children of<br />\nTransylvanian nobles.<br />\nFew realize the historical and cultural importance of<br />\nHungary. Even fewer care. For example, I wager my first<br />\nborn not many of you know (or even suspect) that<br />\nbetween the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of<br />\nthe Industrial Era, it was Hungary that kept the red lights<br />\nof prostitution burning throughout central Europe. Under<br />\nUlaslo II, King of Bohemia, the Hungarians developed a<br />\nrace of uberfraus bred for their sexual prowess and ability<br />\nto roll a client. Indeed, the only remaining members of<br />\nthis race are the Gabors.<br />\nGetting back to the point, St. Ladislaus was not<br />\nimportant to just Hungary; he wasn't important to the<br />\nrest of Europe either. His ill-fated conversion of Hungary<br />\nto Hare Krishna in 1267 was the highlight of Clement II's<br />\nbrief tenure as Pope. Upon learning of Laddie's (as his<br />\nfriends called him) actions, the aged rou-e' of Rome issued<br />\na doctrine placing an unreasonable tariff on parika and<br />\nformally making Hungarians third-class citizens, with only<br />\nthe French and Irish below in the hiergrchy. This was too<br />\nmuch for the happy-go-lucky gypsies, so they banished St.<br />\nLaddie. Eventually he found his way .to the New World<br />\nwhere he performed<br />\nthe three miracles to earn his<br />\nsainthood; he lived ten years each in Scranton, New<br />\nBrunswick, and Perth Amboy. Some people talk about<br />\nchanging wine to water or making the blind see, but<br />\nsurvive a summer in Perth Amboy and you'll know what a<br />\nreal miracle is.<br />\nAnd what about Hungarian literature? Yeah, what<br />\nabout Hungarian literature.

The Hutzler \"regulars\"<br />\nrepresent a cross-section of Hopkins undergraduates.<br />\nAs an undergraduate library open 24 hours per day,<br />\nseven days per week, Hutzler manifests the serious<br />\nness of<br />\nan undergraduate education at Hopkins. Above<br />\nall, the<br />\n\"Hut\" is a place to study. At least once during<br />\nhis/her<br />\ncollege career, every Hopkins student pulls an \"allniter\",<br />\nand the Hut is the place to do it.<br />\nHutzler's atmosphere reflects the gravity<br />\nof<br />\nundergraduate life at Hopkins. High ceiling<br />\ns and<br />\n\"institutional green\" walls give the place an<br />\neerie<br />\nambience, especially after 4 am. Portraits of past<br />\nHopkins<br />\nfaculty gaze down on unwary students; like<br />\nHamlet's<br />\nghost, these images from the past remind studen<br />\nts of their<br /><br />\nother Hopkins students struggling through the same<br />\nOrganic Chem problems or trying to memorize the same<br />\n300 names for an American Political Thought exam.<br />\nThe Hutzler regulars can be divided into several groups.<br />\nPerhaps the most obvious classification here is the<br />\ndistinction between smokers and non-smokers. Smokers<br />\nare restricted to Hutzler's North Wind and are generally<br />\nmore rowdy than the non-smokers.<br />\nThe \"jokers\" constitute a significant segment of the<br />\nHutzler regulars. These Hopkins uridergrads climb the<br />\nscaffolds present in the Hut for repairs, lead the steaks,<br />\nand participate in the fraternity initiations at the Hut. In<br />\nthis way, Hutzler represents the levity of Hopkins, for it is<br />\na place to laugh, to enjoy oneself.<br />\nThe \"minglers\" are closely akin to the jokers,for they<br />\nenjoy the lighter side of Hutzler. The minglers check out<br />\nthe social scene at the Hut, discourse on the perilous state<br />\nof affairs at Hopkins and in the world, and then go home<br /><br />\nThis is my cow<br />\nI want her now<br /><br />\nElsie is mine<br />\nAnd drinks fine wine<br />\nThese are of course, Sipos' famous \"veal couplets.\"<br />\nHere, in America, though, the average Hungarian is<br />\ncharacterized as a heavy drinking gypsy, who is poor,<br />\nsuspicious, and ready to kill over a chicken. And that's<br />\nperfectl y true. Take a Hungarian out of his homeland and<br />\nhe becomes a completely different person. He becomes an<br />\noutcast relegated to the inner core of blighted urban<br />\nareas, denied the opportunity for a good job and<br />\neducation. The average Hungarian-American is little better<br />\noff than the average Mick.<br />\nI know the words to the \"Hungarian Rhapsody\" and<br />\nthey do not portend good fortune for chauvinists like<br />\nyou, McConsaidin. The lyrics tell of a gypsy boy of a<br />\nhumble background who rises through the ranks to be<br />\nKing of the Gypsies. And through a series of remarkable<br />\nevents, he eventually becomes Emperor of the World, The<br />\nExalted Ruler, The Grand Poobah of us all. Only in<br />\nAmerica, as Jay and the Americans would have it, could a<br />\npoor boy like me become The Grand Poobah. And when<br />\nthat 'happens, McConsaidin, you'd better be on the first<br />\npotato boat back to County Cork. I have your number.<br />\nI remain,<br />\nCasmii Devacs<br /><br />\nresponsibilities at Hopkins.<br />\nHutzler has grace, style, and charm. Unlike the sterilt<br />\ncinderblock construction of the Eisenhower Library<br />\nHutzler has a personality all its own. The huge Corint<br />\nhian<br />\npillars and the tall stained glass windows are<br />\nof an<br />\narchitectural style long since eclipsed by square,<br />\nlifeless<br />\n,construction.<br />\nHutzler, the original JHU library, represents Hopkin<br />\ns<br />\npast and present. The acoustics of the Hutzle<br />\nr Room sitting in the central rotunda allows One to hear<br />\nwhispers<br />\nat the other end of the room - are clearly<br />\nfrom a time<br />\npast, when less refined building methods were<br />\nused. Yet<br />\nHutzler represents the present at Hopkins,<br />\nfor its vast<br />\nperiodical collection allows undergraduates<br />\nto keep in<br />\ntouch with the contemporary outside world.<br />\nMany Hopkins students are Hutzler \"regul<br />\nars\" - these<br />\nstudents find the Hut the place to study. But<br />\nHutzler is<br />\nmore than just a room to study in; it is a<br />\nplace to meet<br /><br />\nto study.<br />\nThe \"sleepers\" are the last major group of Hutzler<br />\nregulars. These individuals curl up on the sofas for three<br />\nhours a night, only to be rudely awakened at 7 am by the<br />\ncleaning woman, yelling, \"What do you think this is, a<br />\nhotel?\"<br />\nHutzler is administered by two full-time librarians,<br />\nassisted by eight student assistants and security<br />\npersonnnel.

President Ford was quoted as<br />\nsaying: \"Dr. Know helped me fudge the Warren Report.\"<br />\n\"Dr. Know helped me through college,\" Sen. Ted<br />\nKennedy was quoted as saying.<br />\nBruce and Marty are both graduates of the University<br />\nof Michigan where they each won Hopwood awards in<br />\nWining. They had come to Boulder in the summer, and<br />\nstarted the Dr. Know service about two months before<br />\ntheir arrest, as a way of paying rent and expressing what<br />\nMarty called \"our serious political views on various<br />\nissues.\"<br />\nQUESTION: Why did you start this business of writing<br />\nPapers for people?<br />\nBRUCE: Well, actually we were strapped for dollars.<br />\nFinancially embarassed, you might say. Both of us are<br />\nwriters, working with both fiction and fact, and generally<br />\nhaving a hard time making money in this field, which is<br />\nno surprise. We formed the agency one morning over<br />\nbreakfast, advertised with posters, and did typing and<br />\nediting jobs in addition to writing a few papers each.<br />\nQ: How much did you charge?<br />\nB: Generally three to five dollars per page for an<br />\noriginal assignment. We had no files. Everything was done<br />\nfrom scratch. When you broke it down, it didn't come out<br />\nSO good per hour. But as non-alien<br />\nated labor, when you<br /><br />\ncould work on something you -were interested in, it Was a<br />\ngood deal.<br />\nQ: What of students used the service?<br />\nB: Students who didn't have the time or just weren't<br />\ninterested in the subject. Almost all of them could have<br />\nwritten the paper themselves, but just didn't want to. If a<br />\nstudent comes to college to learn, he will. In some cases,<br />\nhowever, students who had us write papers for them<br />\nactually got turned on to the subject matter, since he<br />\nor<br />\nshe had to read the paper and understand it before<br />\nturning it in.<br />\nMARTY: As a matter of fact, one guy who never<br />\nheard<br />\nof Walt Whitman is now reading the complete Leaves of<br />\nGrass. And the paper for which we were busted was<br />\ndescribed as \"fantastic\" by the undercover officer who<br />\narrested us.<br />\nQ: Did you ever consider that what you were doing was<br />\n\"Almost all of them could have written the paper<br />\nthemselves, but just didn't want to. If a student<br />\ncomes to college to learn, he will.\"<br />\nwrong?<br />\nB: Strictly from the legal angle, no. The University<br />\nnever warned us that what we were doing was not legal. It<br />\nturns out there is a statute, as we found out. I was<br />\ncharged with a class one misdemeanor which could be a<br />\n$1000 fine and six months in jail.<br />\nM: I don't feel like a criminal, but I guess these days<br />\nyou never know. The whole environment, as I see it, is<br />\nmorally ambiguous. For example, information was<br />\nrevealed recently that the Army had released a pathogenic<br />\ngerm warfare bacillus on the New York subway to run<br />\n\"vulnerability tests.\" Who supports and is responsible for<br />\nsuch developments? The main culprit is the University,<br />\nwhich has been doing top-secret research in this area for<br />\nyears. In comparison, we were very open about what we<br />\nwere doing. We put our house phone number on all the<br /><br />\nposters. Unlike classified research done by intelligence<br />\nagencies, universities, and the military, our files and<br />\nresearch are open to everyone at all times. All information<br />\nto the people; that could be our slogan.<br />\nQ: Are you worried at this time about the charges?<br />\nB: Well, no one wants to be made an example of, which<br />\nsometimes happens in these cases. Ghostwriting, though,<br />\nis something that appears before us in speechwriting,<br />\nnewswriting, pen-names, CIA reports, and anonymous<br />\nsubversive leaflets. It's everywhere. Do you think Nixon<br />\nactually ever wrote or believed anything he spewed out<br />\nover the TV waves to catatonic millions?<br />\nM: At least we have a sense of humor, which is more<br />\nthan we can say for most political speech-writers, except<br />\npossibly Robert Dole's.<br />\nQ: Most people hate writing papers. Why did you pick<br />\nthis as your job?<br />\nB: This is basically what we know how to do. And, by<br />\npicking papers to Write which were relevant to the species<br />\ncrisis which confronts us collectively as members of the<br />\nhuman group, we were able to sharpen our own ideas on<br />\nthese matters. For instance, in our papers we took stands<br />\naginst the American Medical Association,. multinational<br />\ncorporations, outer space colonization, recombinant DNA<br />\nresearch, forced drug therapy in mental institutions, and<br />\nthe findings of the Warren Co: imission.<br />\nQ: Now that Dr. Know is being laid rests, are either of<br />\nyou considering going back to school to write your own<br />\npapers? If you could guarantee an A or B or refund half<br />\nthe money if the paper received a lower grade, you must<br />\nbe somewhat academically oriented.<br />\nM: Something about the grading system and the<br />\nbureaucracy which creates competition as an end in itself<br />\nis basically repugnant to both of us. Before the University<br />\nbecame a corporation, it was customary for the young<br />\nman to go into the Army. Now he is enrolled in college.<br />\nAfter four years as an undergrad, I'm not surt there's<br />\nmuch difference, although I don't iTmembe; killing<br />\nanyone.<br /><br />\npage 8/news-letter/march 22,1977<br /><br />\nird1/4/40211211/%211W/Caral<br /><br />\nf<br /><br />\nWEDNESDAY NOON SERIES<br />\npresented by<br />\nThe Office of Special Events<br /><br />\nSTUDY IN NEW YORK<br />\nTHIS SUMMER Columbia<br />\nUniversity offers over 400<br />\nundergraduate and<br />\nprofessional school<br />\ncourses.

There is a legend that still survives<br />\namong team members about the sophomore golfer who<br />\nwent to a past athletic director and complained, \"We<br />\ndon't get enough exposure or publicity. Nobody listens to<br />\nus.\" The athletic director said,\"Next!\"<br />\nCompared to lacrosse players, golfers seem like the 99<br />\nlb. weaklings whose face you kicked sand into last<br />\nsummer. Fallacious notions abound among the ignorant<br />\nthat golfers are in some way inferior sissified beings.<br />\nThat's completely false; golfers have taken more of their<br />\nshare of the local honeys behind the gasworks to watch<br />\nthe submarine races. And contrary to popular belief,<br />\ngolers use every muscle in their body to generate a<br />\nclubhead speed of more than 150 miles per hour.<br />\n\"Golf provides an occasional escape from the pressure<br />\nof Hopkins academics,\" clains Win Smith, aimable mentor<br />\nof the Blue Jay squad. \"In golf there's a certain<br />\ninteraction between man and nature, and between man<br />\nand himself. Golf is also a game that requires great<br />\nphysical strength and coordination, but even more<br />\nimportantly, coordination between mind and body.\"<br />\nLast year the Hopkins golf team struggled to a dismal<br />\nrecord nobody seems to remember. Competition against<br />\nDivision I schools, illness, academics, and a lack of team<br />\nmembers all contributed to the unfortunate downfall.<br />\nHowever, this year's team suffers from none of these<br />\nand, according Smith, a Hopkins graduate himself, has<br />\ngreat potential. \"We're looking forward to placing in the<br />\nMAC Championship and to possibly win a berth in the<br />\nNCAA Division III finals. I feel the talent to do this exists<br />\namong the guys on the team.\"<br />\nReturning lettermen include junior Captain Mike Deak,<br />\nand sophomores Pat Caruso and Barclay Knapp. .<br /><br />\nAcademic pressure has prompted the early retirement of<br />\nsweetswinging senior Joe Arminio. But Smith does not<br />\ndespair.<br />\n\"We have a number of fine fresh young players,\" the<br />\ncoach explained, \"so Joe's presence will not really be<br />\nmissed.\"<br />\nSpearheading the newcomers are freshmen Dave<br />\nDeSmith, Jeff Ferris, Alan Wormser, Carlos Sera, Teddy<br />\nFirestone, and transferee Michel Krug. \"I'm pleased with<br />\nthe enthusiasm they have shown,\" the coach boasted, \"I<br />\nthink this is the nucleus for a powerhouse of Hopkins golf<br />\nin the future.\"<br />\nThe highlight of the year so far has been Dave<br />\nDeSmith's hole-in-one last Saturday during the annual<br />\nintra-squad Spring Tournament at Mount Pleasant Golf<br /><br />\n4111111141410\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u202200110<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nCourse.

Myrick, a four year starter from Towson, led all<br />\ngoal scorers with four in addition to picking up a lone<br />\nassist, while DeSimone, a Long Island product who<br />\ntransferred to JHU after being an All-American two years<br />\nago at Navy, chipped in with three goals and two assists.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that Myrick led all Jay<br />\nmidfielders in scoring a year ago, although he had only 23<br />\npoints for the entire season!<br />\nHopkins, behind Myrick's sharpshooting, broke on top<br />\nquickly against the visitors from Connecticut and never<br />\ntrailed. The Jays gained control of the opening draw and<br />\nforty-four seconds later, Myrick notched his first goal<br />\nwith an assist to Mike O'Neill and JHU led 1-0. Less than<br />\na minute later, the Jays grabbed a 2-0 advantage, as<br />\nDeSimone fed Myrick for the game's second goal.<br />\nYale closed the gap to 2-1, as the Bulldogs took<br />\nadvantage of an extra-man situation created when a JHU<br />\ndefender was penalized. However, JHU retaliated quickly<br />\nwith DeSimone firing a pair of unassisted goals past the<br />\nhelpless Yale goalie to give the Jays a 4-1 lead with five<br />\nminutes still left in the opening period.<br />\nYale capitalized on the extra-man advantage once again<br />\nto bring the count to 4-2, but Blue Jay sophmore<br />\nmidfielder Dave Huntley fired home a shot to culminate a<br />\nfast break and Hopkins led 5-2.<br />\nYale closed out the first period scoring with yet anther<br />\nextra-man situation goal. With Hopkins being penalized<br />\nfairly often and the visitors apparent ability to score with<br />\nthe man advantage, it appeared as though perhaps Yale<br />\nwould be able to hang close.<br />\nHowever, the Blue Jay defense did an abrupt about<br />\nface following their lackluster first period performance.<br /><br />\nThey totally disengaged the Bulldog offensive machinery ,<br />\nshutting out Yale for almost three-quarters of the game.<br />\nMost impressive was the fact that the visitors had eight<br />\nmore man-advantage situatiohs in the game, but the<br />\nyoung Jay defense allowed nb goals as the result of the<br />\nadvantage.<br />\nWhereas the defense improv'ed immeasurably during the<br />\nsecond period, the offense began to slow down. Freshman<br />\nJon Swerdloff and Myrick ware the only goal scorers in<br />\nthe quarter, giving JHU a 7-3 halftime lead.<br />\nThe opening minutes of the second half were<br />\nmarked by some sloppy play on both sides, but the Jays<br />\nquickly regained their composure and the offense began<br />\nto reassert itself.<br />\n'Within a two minute time span, O'Neill, Rich Hirsch<br />\nand DeSimone pumped the ball past the Bulldog goalie to<br />\ngive Hopkins a commanding 10-3 lead. Senior midfielder<br />\nGeorge Johnson scored the first of his two goals late in<br />\nthe quarter to give JHU an 11-3 advantage after forty-five<br />\nminutes of play.<br />\nThe large lead gave Hopkins coach Henry Ciccarone a<br />\nchance to rest his starters on attack and defense in the<br />\nfinal period and to let younger players receive valuable<br />\ngame experience. The tempo of the game, however, did<br />\nnot change as Hopkins continued total domination at<br />\nboth ends of the field. The defense, led by freshman<br />\ngoalie Mike Federico (in for starter Kevin Mahon),<br />\ncontnued the excellent play, allowing Yale only one goal<br />\nand that coming with fifteen seconds remaining in the<br />\ncontest.<br />\nThe offense was sparked by Swerdloff. The first year<br />\nplayer from Baltimore added two goals giving him four<br />\npoints in his first game. Myrick and Johnson also scored<br />\nto bring the final count to 15-4.<br />\nAfter the game, Ciccarone noted that the scoring from<br />\nthe midfield has a continuation of a trend set in<br />\nscrimmages and was not surprised.<br />\n\"We have much more balance on offense this year,\" the<br />\nCoach explained. \"In the past, we've been much more<br />\nattack oriented. People are so conscious of(Mike)O'Neill<br />\nthat he'll probably be getting more assists this season.\"<br />\nCiccarone added that he was \"disappointed\" that the<br /><br />\ndefense had given up three extra-man goals in the first<br />\nperiod. He said that the team had been working on this<br />\nand that they went over this at halftime.<br />\n\"We weren't anticipating enough,\" Ciccarone added.<br />\nThe Jays swing back into action next Saturday as they<br />\ntravel up the road to meet Division II power Towson<br />\nState. Other games during the vacation will include<br />\nWashington College (3/29) and Princeton (4/2).<br /><br />\nSwimmers win NCAA Division III championship<br />\nThe Hopkins men's varsity swim team spent the past<br />\nweekend in Ohio doing something that only lacrosse<br />\nteams are supposed to accomplish at JHU- winning a<br />\nnational championship.<br />\nPaced by freshman Bill Smiddy and sophomore Mike<br />\nBay, the Blue Jay aquamen swam away from the rest of<br />\nthe field as they captured the third annual NCAA Division<br />\nSwimming and Diving championships. The Jays amassed<br />\n272 points for the three day competition, leaving<br />\nrunner-up Occidental (Calif.) College (198 points) and<br />\nthird place Kenyon (Ohio) College (172) floundering in<br />\nthe Blue Jay wake.<br />\nFor the swimmers of Head Coach Frank Comfort, the<br />\nchampionship marked the end of several years of<br />\nfrustration. In the previous two national meets, the Jays<br />\nhad finished second and, according to Comfort, he<br />\n\"couldn't have imagined finishing second again.\"<br />\nSmiddy and Bay prgvided much of the impetus for the<br />\nvictory. The<br />\nduo combined for five individual<br />\nchampionships- two of wmcn\u2022 were in national record<br />\nbreaking time.<br />\nBill, a 'first year competitor from Wilmington,<br />\nDelaware, was the meet's lone triple winner, capturing<br />\nfirst place in the 200-yard individual medley, the<br />\n100-yard breaststroke, and the 200-yeard breaststroke.<br />\nHis performance in the 100-yard breaststroke was a new<br />\nnational Division III standard, while his times in the other<br />\nraces established new University records.<br />\nA triple winner a year ago, Mike captured first place<br />\nhonors in a pair of events this year. He outdistanced the<br />\nfield in a pair of events this year. He outdistanced the<br />\nfield in the 400-yard individual medley (for a new<br />\nnational record) and the 200-yard backstroke, while also<br />\nfinishing fourth to teammate Smiddy in the 200-yard<br />\nindiviudal medley.<br />\nThe first day of the competition was Thursday and the<br />\nend of that session saw the Jays and Occidental tied for<br />\nthe overall team lead with 69 points apiece. In addition to<br />\nthe one-four\"placing of Smiddy and Bay in the 200-IM on<br />\nthat day, JHU also got points from DiCio (second in the<br />\none meter diving event), Tim Collins (eighth in the 500<br />\nyard freestyle) and a third place finish from the 400 yard<br />\nmedley relay team of Smiddy, Bay, Sam Taylor, and Roy<br />\nBeveridge.<br /><br />\nWas this where Comfort had hoped to be after the<br />\nopening day- in a tie for first?<br />\n\"I didn't know what to expect on the first day,\" the<br />\nCoach explained. \"On the second day, however, I had<br />\nhoped to be up by at least 15 points.\"<br />\nThe close of competition on Friday showed that<br />\nComfort had gotten his wish, with some to spare. The<br />\nJays held a 29 point lead over Occidental, 156-127, after<br />\ntwo days of swimming.<br />\nBoth Bay and Smiddy had captured individual titles on<br />\nFriday. Bay had won the 400 yard IM while Smiddy had<br />\nled an incredible Hopkins performance in the 100-yard<br />\nbreaststroke.<br />\nThe breaststroke events had been a Blue Jay strength<br />\nthroughout the entire season and the national meet<br />\nsimply reaffirmed this fact.,In addition to Smiddy's first<br />\nplace finish, JHU swimmers Brian Kutsunai (4th), Bill<br />\nSick (5th), Rick Goodale (8th) and Dean Buchenauer<br />\n(9th) added points to the JHU total through their efforts<br />\nin this event.<br />\nOther point scorers on Friday included co-captain John<br />\nDierkes(7th in the 100-yard backstroke) and a sixth place<br />\nfinish from the'800-yard free relay team.<br />\nSaturday's competiton saw the Jays pull even farther<br />\naway from the rest of the pack. Hopkins had three<br />\nindiviudal winners- Smiddy in the 200-breaststroke, Bay<br />\nin the 200-backstroke and co-captain Mark Tohir in the<br />\n3-meter diving- in addition to a bevy of other performers<br />\nwho finished in the top twelve of their event and<br />\ntherefore increased the Jay point total.<br />\nSmiddy once again led an excellent performance in the<br />\nbreaststroke event. Kutsunai, Buchenauer, Goodale and<br />\nSick all finished in the final twelve of this event, giving<br />\nthe JHU breaststroke team a total of over 90 points for<br />\nthe meet- a performance that would have ranked them as<br />\nthe 8th best over-all team in the meet!<br />\nKutsunai, a freshman from Honolulu, Hawaii, proved<br />\nto be the team's number three swimmer at the<br />\nchampionships. He has given .outstanding performances<br />\nthroughout the season ,and carne on to be an excellent<br />\nnational competitor.<br />\nDierkes followed teammate Bay with a sixth place<br />\nfinish in the 200-backstroke, while DiCio backed up Tohir<br />\nby coming in fourth in the diving.<br /><br />\nOther point scorers on the final day of competition<br />\nwe re Collins and Mike McNamara (4th and 12th<br />\nrespectively in the 1650-yard freestyle), Sam Taylor's<br />\neleventh olace effort in the- 220-yard butterfly and a<br />\nsimilar finish from the 400-yard free relay team.<br />\nComfort was obviously ecs,tatic concerning his team's<br />\nperformance.<br />\n\"We swam,extremely well,\" the Coach proclaimed. \"It<br />\nwas just a fan'tastic meet.<br />\n\"We have an awful lot of depth. The other teams didn't<br />\nhave the depth to swim with us. You need the big guys,<br />\nlike Bay and Smiddy, to carry you, but you have to have<br />\nthe depth to win it.\"<br /><br />\nFencers come<br />\nFollowing a somewhat disappointing performance in<br />\nthe MAC championship the Blue Jay men's varsity fencing<br />\nteam traveled to Penn State on March 12th to participate<br />\nin the North Atlantic Championships.<br />\nPer forming with a fully recovered team (several<br />\nmembers had been ill for the MAC's), Hopkins fenced<br />\nextremely well and took second place, trailing only host<br />\nPenn State by eight.<br />\nThe foil, epee and sabre teams each finished second in<br />\ntheir respective divisions and the three-way victory total<br />\nof 57 established JHU as one of the best teams in the<br />\nEast.<br />\nFor JHU, Dave Grabatak and co-captain Frank<br />\nMurabito worked in the epee category. Both compiled<br />\nrecords of 9-3, Grabarek on the A strip and Murabito on<br />\nthe B strip.<br />\nIn the Sabre division, Frank Burton fenced on the A<br />\nstrip while Eric Cordts competed on the B strip. Burton<br />\nmatched his epee teammates, establishing a 9-3 record,<br />\nwhile Cordts led the entire B field, compiling an 11-1<br />\nmark.<br />\nEric Newman and co-captain Dave Bell were the<br />\nHomewood competitors bn the foil mats. Newman fenced<br />\non A strip and finished with a creditable 8-4 record, while<br />\nBell matched Cordts with an 11-1 performance.<br />\nThe final competition for the Jays will be the NCAA<br />\nchampionships held later this month at Notre Dame<br /><br />\nIn the course of h istory at any great university<br />\n(for this article, assume<br />\nHopkins is such)<br />\nthere are likely to occur certain moments which<br />\nwill forever linger in the collective consciousness<br />\nof the participants, moments that are logically<br />\nremembered over after-dinner brandies as<br />\n\"unforgettable.\" For some it may be that instant<br />\nof glory after scoring the winning goal in a<br />\nlacrosse game, while for others it may be that<br />\nsudden and unexpected revelation in the<br />\nchemistry lab and, a mad dash down Charles<br />\nStreet shouting \"Eureka!\"<br />\nF or most, though,. these \"unforgettable\"<br />\nmoments arc less than traumatic and often take<br />\nfarcical forms, like the times the guys over at<br />\nDelta Delta gave Charlie Feeney a hot foot or<br />\nwhen Binky Chesterfield- realized his jockey<br />\nshorts were filled with shaving cream. I know I<br />\nwill never forget when a freshman chum of mine<br />\n(who has since died and gone to Hofstra) flicked<br />\nhis cigarette ashes in some girl's hair to impress us<br />\nwith his uncouthness. Of course some of these<br />\npersonal epophanies are not that frivolous or<br />\npublic; usually they're quite dramatic and happen<br />\nwhen you're alone. And for the rest of your life,<br /><br />\nmy head was a ghasty Burma Shave jingle--My job is keeping<br />\nFaces clean<br />\nAnd nobody knows<br />\nDe stubble I've seen.<br /><br />\nI was, as one of my students apologizes, all burnt<br />\nout.<br />\nEvery poet has his earthly nemesis. Mine was<br /><br />\nMoose jerke.ns, an ex-Marine doubling as my<br />\nroommate. He persistently chided me because I<br />\nwould wait until after lights out to change into<br />\nmy Dr. Dentons.- Mo9se spread the malicious<br />\nrumour throughout th'e dorm that I possessed \"A<br />\ndisposition slightly less than that of the average<br />\nJoe, if you know what I mean.\" I had always<br />\nthought my somewhat delicate constitution was<br />\nconsistent with my role as the next Housman, and<br />\nI never presumed my sexual affiliation would be<br />\nquestioned, especially in a multiple choice exam.<br />\nThe craze about my reputed \"deformity\"<br />\nquietly died, but still there was the problem of<br />\nliving with Moose. Asked why he left the Marines,<br /><br />\neyes in marriage to that old hag of an academic.<br />\nHer eyes were like jasmine zircons floating in<br />\nlimpid pools of moonlight and her laughtef<br />\ntwinkled like champagne glasses cascading down a<br />\ncarpeted staircase. Head over heels in love I must<br />\nhave been for [tripped on the welcome mat and<br />\nfound myself face to face with her left ankle.<br />\n\"You like my ankle?\" she chirped.<br />\n\"I have my mind on higher things,\" I replied<br />\nwithout thinking.<br />\nLuckily Professor Gompers appeared and led<br />\nthe way into the drawing room. \"Nothing<br />\nstronger than Ceylon Breakfast for me,\" the<br />\nprofessor said choosing his tea, \"I remember the<br />\ntime we were staying with some friends in<br />\nFlorence- and somehow they tricked me into<br />\nhaving 'three cups of Darjeering. Why I could<br />\nhardly walk back to the hotel.\"<br />\n\"Occasionally, when I'm out with the boys,\" I<br />\nbegan, \"I like to 'tie a few on' by }having; a couple<br />\ncups of Oolong or Orange Pekoe.\"<br />\n\"My goodness,\" Professor Gompers interjected,<br />\n\"My head's beginning to feel a bit \u2022 woozy.

Otley, a '57 graduate of Hopkins, now<br />\nteaches English at a prep school in New England,<br />\na position where he can insulate himself from the<br />\ntraumas of the past. By nature, he's a rather<br />\nmelancholy spirit subject to frequent funks<br />\nwhich, I suspect, were the breeding grounds for<br />\nthis confession. I was so overwhelmed after<br />\nreading the letter I immediately called<br />\nlong-distance for his permission to reprint it. He<br />\nagreed on the grounds that I \"tactfully\" change<br />\nall the names, including his. \"Ghosts can read,\"<br />\nhe warned.<br />\nSo, a fanfare, please professor, here itis:<br />\nEver since A.E. Housman died there hasn't<br />\nbeen a poet with enough grace to carry on in his<br />\nstead. I came to Hopkins with the ambition of<br />\nbecoming his logical successor. But something<br />\nwent wrong; it was as if the Fates had revoked my<br />\npoetic license. The only poetry that ran though<br /><br />\nhe replied, \"I was rotten to the corps.\" That was could answer, \"Sleeping Pills.\"<br />\nhis idea of humour. This, from a man who said at<br />\nWell, dear cousin, my face \u2022 was a picture of<br />\na Valentine's Day Dance at Notre Dame, \"I've shock.
