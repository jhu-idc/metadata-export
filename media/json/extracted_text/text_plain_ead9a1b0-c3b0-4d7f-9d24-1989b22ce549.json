C. A. ASSOCIATION<br />\nRecommendations and Regulations Intended for Adoption by American<br />\nCollege Baseball Teams.<br />\n<br />\nThe National Collegiate Athletic<br />\nAssociation, to which Dr. Ronald<br />\nT. Abercrombie is the Hopkins representative, has formulated the following recommendations and regulations which are intended for adoption by American college baseball<br />\nteams. The rules were prepared by<br />\na special committee which studied<br />\nthe baseball situation, and were accepted by the Association. It is<br />\nhoped that they will be put in force<br />\nthroughout the country. The report of the committee follows:<br />\n<br />\nthe batsman or any member of the opposing team.<br />\nSecond\u2014No member .of either team<br />\nshall call or shout during the game to<br />\nany member of the opposing team, except to caution him against some danger,<br />\nnor behave in any indecorous or unseemly manner.<br />\nThird\u2014There shall be no oral coaching from the bench.<br />\nFourth \u2014 The so-called \"encouragement of the pitcher\" from the outfield<br />\nshall be stopped, or at least minimized,<br />\nsince we believe that the shouting of remarks in endless iteration is not only<br />\ndisagreeable to the spectators, but it is<br />\ndisconcerting rather than helpful to the<br />\npitcher. In general, it amounts merely to<br />\nsenseless noise, and is quite unworthy<br />\nof college-bred men. Whatever \"encouragement\" or \"support\" the pitcher<br />\nmay need can be quietly given from the<br />\ninfield.<br />\nFifth \u2014 The umpire shall warn any<br />\nplayer violating any of these rules, and<br />\non a second offense shall exclude him<br />\nfrom the game.<br />\nSixth\u2014That in general the attention<br />\nof students be called to the importance<br />\nof courtesy on the part of the home institution to the visiting team, a courtesy<br />\nwhich will forbid such cheering, singing<br />\nor chatter as are designed at critical<br />\nmoments to \"rattle\" the visiting team.<br />\nA baseball game is a splendid contest<br />\nof skill between two opposing nines, before an academic throng of spectators;<br />\nit is not a contest between a visiting<br />\nteam and a local team assisted by a disorderly rabble. It is delightful when, as<br />\noften happens, a fine play by the visiting<br />\nteam is as heartily applauded as a similar<br />\nplay by the home team.<br />\nTo the end that these principles, if endorsed by this Association, be a real<br />\nforce and not a mere brutum fulmen, we<br />\nrecommend that, if adopted, this report<br />\nbe printed in separate form and copies<br />\nbe sent by the secretary to the presidents, the deans, the athletic directors<br />\nor similar officers, the chairmen of faculty committees on athletic sports and to<br />\nthe editors of .undergraduate publications of all colleges and universities aid<br />\nalso to the leading preparatory schools<br />\nin the United States, with a formal request for action thereon and a report of<br />\nsuch action to the secretary of the Association.<br />\nLours BErrry. JR., Chairman.<br />\n<br />\nYour committee has for the time being nothing to do with the difficult question of eligibility, nor with summer ball<br />\nin its relation to amateur sport. It is<br />\nconcerned with what is appropriate and<br />\ndesirable in the conduct of the game<br />\nitself, in order that the manners of<br />\nofficials, players and spectators may be<br />\nuniformly those of a gentleman, where<br />\nthe highest ideals of fairness and sportsmanship shall be maintained, as is so admirably done in intercollegiate tennis.<br />\nWe do not think that anything should<br />\nbe recommended which would diminish<br />\nthe virility of the game, or lessen the<br />\nscope of individual skill, or of clever<br />\nteam-work, but we earnestly contend<br />\nthat strategy must not deteriorate into<br />\ntrickery, and that the rules of the game<br />\nmust be observed, not only in letter,<br />\nbut in spirit as well.<br />\nTo this end, your committee recommends:<br />\nFirst\u2014The strict enforcement of Rule<br />\n58 of the official rule book, which defines the coaching rules at first and<br />\nthird bases, explicitly providing that \"the<br />\ncoacher shall be restricted to coaching<br />\nthe base runner only, and shall not address remarks except to the base runner,<br />\nand then only in words of assistance and<br />\ndirection in running bases. He shall not<br />\nby words or signs incite or try to incite<br />\nthe spectators to demonstrations, and<br />\nshall not use language which will in any<br />\nmanner refer to or reflect upon a player<br />\nof the opposite club, the umpire or the<br />\nspectators.\"<br />\nSecond\u2014The strict enforcement of<br />\nAT OTHER COLLEGES<br />\nRule 21, Paragraph 1, which explicitly<br />\nprovides that \"under no circumstances<br />\nshall the -umpire permit any person exMichigan has plans for a stadium<br />\ncept the players and substitutes in uniform and the manager of the team en- like that at Harvard, and it is estititled to its use to be seated on a bench.\" mated that the structure will seat<br />\nThis rule places the professional coach 13,000<br />\npersons.<br />\nor trainer among the spectators, where<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nhe should be during the actual progress<br />\nof the game, and places the responsibility<br />\nColorado Agricultural College<br />\nfor the conduct of .the play in the hands<br />\nof the amateur players themselves.<br />\nseniors decided to raise moustaches.<br />\nThird\u2014The strict enforcement by the As soon as a number of them had<br />\numpire of the rules forbidding \"blocking<br />\na runner,\" \"prying a runner off the successfully coaxed out a faint<br />\nbase,\" and the like, as unfair practice, adornment the underclassmen rose<br />\nand\u201ewe appeal to student public opinion en masse and shaved them.<br />\nto condemn such trickery, making it im* * *<br />\npossible even should it elude the vigilance of the umpire.

They<br />\nhad been obtained, moreover, by<br />\npurchase, in many cases, from foreign countries\u2014from Holland, from<br />\nFrance and from Italy. It is no<br />\nterrible crime to sell to a foreign<br />\ncountry that which has been bought<br />\nfrom one. While bewailing the departure of art objects from England, the English sentimentalists<br />\nforget the purchase of the Elgin<br />\nmarbles. These comprise no less a<br />\ntreasure than the elaborately and<br />\nbeautifully sculptured frieze of the<br />\nParthenon, which Lord Elgin<br />\nbought from the Greek Government for the sum of i40,000. This<br />\naction has been denounced as vandalism ; but, (respite the denunciations, no English Government has<br />\never has the courage to propose<br />\ntheir restoration to Athens.<br />\n\"It all depends, then, on whose<br />\nox is gored.\"<br /><br />\nBaseball is more subject to outside<br />\ninfluences than any other college<br />\nsport. The remarkable growth of the<br />\ngreat national game has been accompanied by an increasing lack of<br />\nethics, and the college players, given<br />\nto a certain amount of emulation,<br />\nare beginning to adopt the spirit of<br />\nplay shown by the professionals on<br />\nthe diamond.<br />\nProfessional baseball, at bottom,<br />\nis commercial; its primary object<br />\nis to make money for its backers.<br />\nMoney can best be made when the<br />\ncrowds are pleased, and to please<br />\nthe crowds games must be won, no<br />\nmatter by what means. And some<br />\nof these means have become objectionable. \"Little tricks of the<br />\ntrade,\" so to speak, have been employed to outwit opponents and win<br />\ngames. Unfortunately, too, these<br />\nobjectionable features have crept into the college game. Many persons<br />\nhave deplored their introduction,<br />\nbut have been unable to direct concerted corrective measures against<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe situation has reached that<br />\npoint where some organized effort<br />\nmust be made to get rid of the bad<br />\nfeatures, and to this end a special<br />\ncommittee appointed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association<br />\nhas made a study of conditions and<br />\npublished a report in which recommendations are made that will tend<br />\nto prevent the introduction of the<br />\nso-called \"professional spirit\"into the<br />\ncollege sport.

C. A. ASSOCIATION<br />\nRecommendations and Regulations Intended for Adoption by American<br />\nCollege Baseball Teams.<br /><br />\nThe National Collegiate Athletic<br />\nAssociation, to which Dr. Ronald<br />\nT. Abercrombie is the Hopkins representative, has formulated the following recommendations and regulations which are intended for adoption by American college baseball<br />\nteams. The rules were prepared by<br />\na special committee which studied<br />\nthe baseball situation, and were accepted by the Association. It is<br />\nhoped that they will be put in force<br />\nthroughout the country. The report of the committee follows:<br /><br />\nthe batsman or any member of the opposing team.<br />\nSecond\u2014No member .of either team<br />\nshall call or shout during the game to<br />\nany member of the opposing team, except to caution him against some danger,<br />\nnor behave in any indecorous or unseemly manner.<br />\nThird\u2014There shall be no oral coaching from the bench.<br />\nFourth \u2014 The so-called \"encouragement of the pitcher\" from the outfield<br />\nshall be stopped, or at least minimized,<br />\nsince we believe that the shouting of remarks in endless iteration is not only<br />\ndisagreeable to the spectators, but it is<br />\ndisconcerting rather than helpful to the<br />\npitcher. In general, it amounts merely to<br />\nsenseless noise, and is quite unworthy<br />\nof college-bred men. Whatever \"encouragement\" or \"support\" the pitcher<br />\nmay need can be quietly given from the<br />\ninfield.<br />\nFifth \u2014 The umpire shall warn any<br />\nplayer violating any of these rules, and<br />\non a second offense shall exclude him<br />\nfrom the game.<br />\nSixth\u2014That in general the attention<br />\nof students be called to the importance<br />\nof courtesy on the part of the home institution to the visiting team, a courtesy<br />\nwhich will forbid such cheering, singing<br />\nor chatter as are designed at critical<br />\nmoments to \"rattle\" the visiting team.<br />\nA baseball game is a splendid contest<br />\nof skill between two opposing nines, before an academic throng of spectators;<br />\nit is not a contest between a visiting<br />\nteam and a local team assisted by a disorderly rabble. It is delightful when, as<br />\noften happens, a fine play by the visiting<br />\nteam is as heartily applauded as a similar<br />\nplay by the home team.<br />\nTo the end that these principles, if endorsed by this Association, be a real<br />\nforce and not a mere brutum fulmen, we<br />\nrecommend that, if adopted, this report<br />\nbe printed in separate form and copies<br />\nbe sent by the secretary to the presidents, the deans, the athletic directors<br />\nor similar officers, the chairmen of faculty committees on athletic sports and to<br />\nthe editors of .undergraduate publications of all colleges and universities aid<br />\nalso to the leading preparatory schools<br />\nin the United States, with a formal request for action thereon and a report of<br />\nsuch action to the secretary of the Association.<br />\nLours BErrry. JR., Chairman.<br /><br />\nYour committee has for the time being nothing to do with the difficult question of eligibility, nor with summer ball<br />\nin its relation to amateur sport. It is<br />\nconcerned with what is appropriate and<br />\ndesirable in the conduct of the game<br />\nitself, in order that the manners of<br />\nofficials, players and spectators may be<br />\nuniformly those of a gentleman, where<br />\nthe highest ideals of fairness and sportsmanship shall be maintained, as is so admirably done in intercollegiate tennis.<br />\nWe do not think that anything should<br />\nbe recommended which would diminish<br />\nthe virility of the game, or lessen the<br />\nscope of individual skill, or of clever<br />\nteam-work, but we earnestly contend<br />\nthat strategy must not deteriorate into<br />\ntrickery, and that the rules of the game<br />\nmust be observed, not only in letter,<br />\nbut in spirit as well.<br />\nTo this end, your committee recommends:<br />\nFirst\u2014The strict enforcement of Rule<br />\n58 of the official rule book, which defines the coaching rules at first and<br />\nthird bases, explicitly providing that \"the<br />\ncoacher shall be restricted to coaching<br />\nthe base runner only, and shall not address remarks except to the base runner,<br />\nand then only in words of assistance and<br />\ndirection in running bases. He shall not<br />\nby words or signs incite or try to incite<br />\nthe spectators to demonstrations, and<br />\nshall not use language which will in any<br />\nmanner refer to or reflect upon a player<br />\nof the opposite club, the umpire or the<br />\nspectators.\"<br />\nSecond\u2014The strict enforcement of<br />\nAT OTHER COLLEGES<br />\nRule 21, Paragraph 1, which explicitly<br />\nprovides that \"under no circumstances<br />\nshall the -umpire permit any person exMichigan has plans for a stadium<br />\ncept the players and substitutes in uniform and the manager of the team en- like that at Harvard, and it is estititled to its use to be seated on a bench.\" mated that the structure will seat<br />\nThis rule places the professional coach 13,000<br />\npersons.<br />\nor trainer among the spectators, where<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nhe should be during the actual progress<br />\nof the game, and places the responsibility<br />\nColorado Agricultural College<br />\nfor the conduct of .the play in the hands<br />\nof the amateur players themselves.<br />\nseniors decided to raise moustaches.<br />\nThird\u2014The strict enforcement by the As soon as a number of them had<br />\numpire of the rules forbidding \"blocking<br />\na runner,\" \"prying a runner off the successfully coaxed out a faint<br />\nbase,\" and the like, as unfair practice, adornment the underclassmen rose<br />\nand\u201ewe appeal to student public opinion en masse and shaved them.<br />\nto condemn such trickery, making it im* * *<br />\npossible even should it elude the vigilance of the umpire.
