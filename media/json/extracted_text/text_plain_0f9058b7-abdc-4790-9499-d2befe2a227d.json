Nobody as<br />\nyet has offered a serious alternative<br />\nto President Roosevelt's recovery program. There is a lot of grumbling,<br />\nnaturally; some of it by those who<br />\ncan see no virtue in anything a Democratic administration does, some of<br />\nit by those impatient ones who think<br />\nthat miracles are possible by which it<br />\ndisturbed world can be set aright<br />\novernight.<br />\nThey have no intelligent substitute<br />\nto offer for the course being followed<br />\nby the President. But they have a<br />\ndelightful time construing every ripple on the sea of politics; every disagreement between a few minor government officials; every error in the<br />\nrecovery processes to which attention<br />\nis called when that error is corrected,<br />\nas evidences of the failure of the program.<br />\nI suppose that such things are unavoidable in a politically-minded<br />\nminded country, particularly as there<br />\nare no real issues on which the administration can be challenged. The<br />\nverdict of last November's election<br />\nshows how little impression this sort<br />\nof thing has on the public mind.<br />\nThis is about as good a time as<br />\nany to tell you that what has happened and is happening is no surprise,<br />\neither to the President or the rest of<br />\nthe administration you put in power<br />\ntwo years ago. Franklin D. Roosevelt<br />\nhad no delusions as to the magnitude<br />\nof the task that confronted him when<br />\nhe came to the White House. He<br />\nknew then and has never lost sight<br />\nof the difficulties that lay ahead of<br />\nhim.<br />\nFortunately, he is a man of infinite<br />\npatience as well as capacity, courage<br />\nand industry. He has met each situation as it arose without panic, without discouragement and without the<br />\nslightest lessening of his faith in the<br />\nultimate outcome.

Nobody as<br />\nyet has offered a serious alternative<br />\nto President Roosevelt's recovery program. There is a lot of grumbling,<br />\nnaturally; some of it by those who<br />\ncan see no virtue in anything a Democratic administration does, some of<br />\nit by those impatient ones who think<br />\nthat miracles are possible by which it<br />\ndisturbed world can be set aright<br />\novernight.<br />\nThey have no intelligent substitute<br />\nto offer for the course being followed<br />\nby the President. But they have a<br />\ndelightful time construing every ripple on the sea of politics; every disagreement between a few minor government officials; every error in the<br />\nrecovery processes to which attention<br />\nis called when that error is corrected,<br />\nas evidences of the failure of the program.<br />\nI suppose that such things are unavoidable in a politically-minded<br />\nminded country, particularly as there<br />\nare no real issues on which the administration can be challenged. The<br />\nverdict of last November's election<br />\nshows how little impression this sort<br />\nof thing has on the public mind.<br />\nThis is about as good a time as<br />\nany to tell you that what has happened and is happening is no surprise,<br />\neither to the President or the rest of<br />\nthe administration you put in power<br />\ntwo years ago. Franklin D. Roosevelt<br />\nhad no delusions as to the magnitude<br />\nof the task that confronted him when<br />\nhe came to the White House. He<br />\nknew then and has never lost sight<br />\nof the difficulties that lay ahead of<br />\nhim.<br />\nFortunately, he is a man of infinite<br />\npatience as well as capacity, courage<br />\nand industry. He has met each situation as it arose without panic, without discouragement and without the<br />\nslightest lessening of his faith in the<br />\nultimate outcome. Under such a leader, the war against adversity is bound<br /><br />\n.... . ..................................:<br />\n........<br />\n............<br />\n....<br />\n....:.:<br />\nl<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\n:\u2022 istit<br />\n.\u2022\u2022\u2022 ............,.....:....:.:::::..i..:..:.;:.:.i.:I.i..\",:.i:1\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\".\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n......<br /><br />\n.....<br /><br />\n..................<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022\u2022<br />\n.....\u2022..\u2022.\u2022..\u2022..\u2022\u2022 ........<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022........\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022 \u2022<br /><br />\n....................\u2022.. ......\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n.....................<br />\n.................\u2022<br /><br />\n..........................\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022::- \u2014 -<br /><br />\nTUNE IN \u2014Luckies are on the air Saturdays, with THE HIT PARADE,over NBC Network 8 to 9 p. m.
