Although the Crescents<br />\nhave lost a good many men<br />\nthrough enlistments, they had<br />\ntheir best team of the season out<br />\nSaturday, including their old<br />\nstars, Wall, Dobby, Kennady, and<br />\nO'Rourke. The Black and Blue<br />\nplayed good lacrosse, the defense<br />\nplaying an especially steady game<br />\nbut they were greatly handicapped<br />\nby the referee's refusing to allow<br />\nbody checking. Several of the<br />\nCrescents were beautiful dodgers,<br />\nbut quick work in intercepting by<br />\nthe close defense, and some pretty<br />\nstops by Sadtler, stopped many<br />\ngood shots. The Crescents juggled their men's positions continually, Bob Wall shifting once<br />\nfrom point to inhome; Kennady<br />\nplayed three or four positions before the game was over. This<br />\nkept the Hopkins defense always<br />\non the look out for unexpected extra men, but Schmidt and Meyer<br />\ndid some beautiful work in breaking up their plays.<br />\nHopkins scored the first goal in<br />\nthe first minute of play, the ball<br />\ngoing straight down the field to<br />\nBaxley, who shot from near the<br />\ncrease.

But O'Rourke finally got<br />\nthe ball, and running around<br />\nthirty yards outside of goal, got<br />\noff a quick, twisting shot which<br />\ngot by Sadtler. From then on the<br />\ngame was very rough, both teams<br />\nfighting their hardest to break the<br />\ntie. Men were put out for periods<br />\non both sides, but the whistle blew<br />\nbefore either team could score<br />\nagain.

That is the all-important<br />\nquestion; it has often been answered by the President and the War<br />\nDepartment. It is once more answered in an article concerning the<br />\nnew \"Enlisted Training Corps\" for college students, which quotes<br />\nPresident Wilson's statement that \"it would seriously impair America's prospects of success in this war if the supply of highly trained<br />\nmen were unneccessarily diminished.\"<br />\nThe War Departnient, to aid in averting this evil, has instituted<br />\na plan whereby all R. 0. T. C. men of eighteen or over will next year<br />\nbe members of the Army of the United States, liable to active duty<br />\nat the call of the President. One of the main objects of this scheme<br />\nis \"to prevent unnecessary and wasteful depletion of the colleges<br />\nthrough indiscriminate volunteering, by offering to the students a<br />\ndefinite and immediate military status.\" The wish, then, of your<br />\ngovernment, college men, is for you to continue your education and<br />\nbecome an officer or at least a highly trained man. Though the<br />\nsoldier's life with its glamor is not immediately entered upon, the<br />\ngreatest service you can render your country is to enlist in this new<br />\nR. 0. T. C. Let us hope that next year every physically fit undergraduate will enroll in this branch of the service.<br />\n. In regard to those who fail to avail themselves of an opportunity to return to college, merely because they are making \"good<br />\nmoney,\" we would say that such a course is unwise to the highest<br />\ndegree. Work this summer by all means and give the best that is<br />\nin you, but do not let the lure of the present high salaries draw you<br />\nfrom your duty at college, where you can get that military knowledge and scientific training needed so much by the government.<br />\nMoreover, after the war the large salaries are obliged to decrease,<br />\nbecause of the falling off in demand for and the increase in supply<br />\nof this kind of labor. Then the man who has left college will fully<br />\nappreciate his lack of training, for instead of holding plates in position for the riveter he might have been drawing plans for ships.<br />\nTraditions.<br />\nWhen one visits the Military and Naval Academies, he is impressed with the value and beauty of their military traditions. We,<br />\ntoo, at Hopkins have been creating this year more in the way of<br />\ntraditions than we realize. The Graduation Review, will in the years<br />\nto come be regarded as one of the biggest events of the year. The<br />\nBattalion dances will be as firmly,linked with the social activities<br />\nas the cotillons. Each company will give its utmost to gain the<br />\ncoveted efficiency cup. Hopkins will annually receive a high grade<br />\nfrom the Government Inspector. These are but a few of the traditions established by the Corps.<br />\n<br />\nINSPECTOR PRAISES BATTALION<br />\nIn Detailed Report Lieut. R. Kelly Lauds<br />\nDiscipline and Appearance of Battalion\u2014Mentions Particularly Work<br />\nof Faculty Staff Officers.<br />\n<br />\nFirst Lieut. Robert F. Kelly, of<br />\nthe 22nd Infantry, made a most<br />\nfavorable report to the Government in regard to the courses in<br />\nmilitary science given at the.Johns<br />\nHopkins University this year. The<br />\nreport contains no adverse criticism; it iQ one which reflects<br />\ncredit on every one who is connected directly or indirectly with<br />\nthe military work done here.<br />\nThe government inspector asserted that a very high degree of<br />\nimportance is attached to the military instruction, that the officer<br />\non duty is vigorously supported<br />\nby the faculty, and that the military professor is quite satisfactory to the authorities of this institution.<br />\nThe Battalion members were<br />\nhighly complimented in his report<br />\nfor the manner in which they<br />\nmaintained a very severe discipline, and zealously performed<br />\ntheir military duties.<br />\nThe following quotations serve<br />\nto give one an idea of how the<br />\nR. 0. T. C. unit of this University<br />\nimpressed the Inspector:<br />\n\"Q. 8. With what degree of zeal<br />\nis military duty performed? A.<br />\nVery zealously.<br />\n\"Q. 9. What was the general<br />\nappearance of the cadets at inspection? A. Very good, both in<br />\nevolutions and details of infantry<br />\ndrill.

It is with a feeling of forensic disappointment that we read<br />\nhis summary; where premises are<br />\nso uniformly unsound, it is no<br />\ntest of metal to meet his arguments. It is surprising but true<br />\nthat he never attempted to verify<br />\nat this office at any time during<br />\nthe weeks which he wrote \"facts\"<br />\neither the gossip which he gathered or his individual judgments.<br />\nIt must be remarked, also, that<br />\nhis most serious charge, that reflecting upon the honesty of the<br />\nAssociation, fell of its own weakness and was hastily abandoned.<br />\nSome weeks since, Mr. Rothschild confessed editorially his<br />\ntotal inability to \"manage\" his<br />\nown staff; nevertheless, we are<br />\nquite ready to consider his wellintentioned strictures upon the<br />\nmanagement of the Athletic Association, observing tranquilly his<br />\npique that we \"have not hitherto<br />\nfelt it at all necessary to explain<br />\nor defend these 'facts,'\" It was<br />\nnot overcrowding to save them<br />\nto this date.<br />\nLet me take up the points in<br />\nMr. Rothschild's summary of May<br />\n13:<br />\n\"First, we want to introduce some<br />\nadditional 'facts' that have recently<br />\ncome to our attention. Two colleges<br />\nof the thirteen that are members, competed in the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Championships at Homewood last..<br />\nSaturday; one of the two was Hop-.<br />\nkins.\"<br />\n<br />\nMr. Rothschild fails to make<br />\nclear his point. Does he mean to<br />\nchide the South Atlantic Association, which rented our field for<br />\na consideration and .which alone<br />\nhad the right and privilege to<br />\nhold or call off the meet?<br />\n\"In his report to the President last<br />\nfall, the Director of the Gymnasium<br />\nsaid: 'It is our desire to get every<br />\nman in the college department engaged<br />\nin some sort of athletic activity, and,<br />\nwith that end in view, the Athletic<br />\nAssociation has engaged for next year<br />\nthe services of Mr. R. G. Murphy, * * *<br />\nHe comes to us * * * to facilitate a<br />\nthorough organization amongst the students for active participation in sports,<br />\nand to further the interest in all intramural sport.' Mr. Murphy enlisted<br />\nin the army and was released from<br />\nthe contract. But the Athletic Association last August, presumably without the knowledge of either board or<br />\nstudent body, engaged the services of<br />\nthe football coach whose last service<br />\nto Hopkins at that time might be expressed in the code form: 55 to 0.\"<br />\n<br />\nMr. Rothschild first recognizes<br />\nthe wisdom of the Association in<br />\nselecting Mr. Murphy, then abruptly condemns us out-of-hand.<br />\nAs to authority, let him read Section 10, General Policy, Constitu,tion:<br />\n\"Under the Director of Gymnasium, the Athletic Board is the<br />\nauthority in all branches of athletics.

As this seems to be the first<br />\ntime that a Chinese student has<br />\ntaken an .active part at a Senior<br />\nBanquet, and as his talk was most<br />\nenthusiastically received by the<br />\nseniors, it follows in part:<br />\n\"As I am standing before you<br />\ntonight on this memorable occasion, it excites in me almost simultaneously two irresistible feelings\u2014the feeling of joy and the<br />\nfeeling of sorrow; of joy because<br />\nit is our privilege, especially<br />\nmine, to be able to complete our<br />\nacademic study at the Johns Hopkins University, the seat of learning and an institution so pregnant with intellectual atmosphere; of sorrow because from<br />\nnow on we will be separated all<br />\nover the world and engaged in<br />\ndifferent lines of activity, and our<br />\nold college days will be but a<br />\nsweet memory.<br />\n\"Of the class of 1918, which I<br />\nlove so much, I am the only student from the Orient.

Enlistment<br />\nwill be purely voluntary but all<br />\nstudents over the age of eighteen<br />\nwill be encouraged to enlist. The<br />\nenlistment will constitute the student a member of the Army of the<br />\nUnited States, liable to active<br />\nduty at the call of the President.<br />\nIt will, however, be the policy of<br />\nthe Government not to call the<br />\nmembers of the training units to<br />\nactive duty until they have<br />\nreached the age of twenty-one, unless urgent military necessity compels an earlier call.

Although the Crescents<br />\nhave lost a good many men<br />\nthrough enlistments, they had<br />\ntheir best team of the season out<br />\nSaturday, including their old<br />\nstars, Wall, Dobby, Kennady, and<br />\nO'Rourke. The Black and Blue<br />\nplayed good lacrosse, the defense<br />\nplaying an especially steady game<br />\nbut they were greatly handicapped<br />\nby the referee's refusing to allow<br />\nbody checking. Several of the<br />\nCrescents were beautiful dodgers,<br />\nbut quick work in intercepting by<br />\nthe close defense, and some pretty<br />\nstops by Sadtler, stopped many<br />\ngood shots. The Crescents juggled their men's positions continually, Bob Wall shifting once<br />\nfrom point to inhome; Kennady<br />\nplayed three or four positions before the game was over. This<br />\nkept the Hopkins defense always<br />\non the look out for unexpected extra men, but Schmidt and Meyer<br />\ndid some beautiful work in breaking up their plays.<br />\nHopkins scored the first goal in<br />\nthe first minute of play, the ball<br />\ngoing straight down the field to<br />\nBaxley, who shot from near the<br />\ncrease. Wardell evened it up for<br />\nthe Crescents a few moments later.<br />\nFrom then till the end of the half<br />\nit was back and forth, up and<br />\ndown the field, the ball most of<br />\nthe time in Hopkins' possession.<br />\nBaxley scored Hopkins' second<br />\npoint from a mix-up in front of<br />\ngoal at the beginning of the second half.<br />\nThe Black and Blue then settled<br />\ndown and played splendidly, and<br />\nit looked for a while as though<br />\nHopkins would get away with the<br />\ngame. But O'Rourke finally got<br />\nthe ball, and running around<br />\nthirty yards outside of goal, got<br />\noff a quick, twisting shot which<br />\ngot by Sadtler. From then on the<br />\ngame was very rough, both teams<br />\nfighting their hardest to break the<br />\ntie. Men were put out for periods<br />\non both sides, but the whistle blew<br />\nbefore either team could score<br />\nagain. Hopkins wanted to play<br />\nan extra period; and would have<br />\nstood a good chance of winning<br />\nhad they been able to play longer,<br />\nfor the team was going finely at<br />\nthe end.<br />\nThe score:<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nBall Team Has Many Chances to Score<br />\nBut Lacks Punch--Bloomsburg Stars<br />\nWith the Willow \u2014 Murray<br />\nArmy's Shining Light.<br /><br />\nThis stately reminder of Johns Hopkins' contribution to the war,<br />\nflies from the student activities building.

Hopkins had<br />\nmany excellent chances to shove<br />\nruns across the plate but the<br />\nbreaks of the game were against<br />\nthem and the man at bat would<br />\neither drive one right at somebody<br />\nor hit a long fly to the outfield.<br />\nAlthough five errors are marked<br />\nup against Hopkins, most of these<br />\nwere made when the sacks were<br />\nunoccupied and when an error<br />\nmeant a run for West Point, the<br />\nHopkins players tightened up and<br />\ngave Welliver brilliant support.<br />\nDespite the fact that three runs<br />\nwere gainered off of his delivery,<br />\nWelliver pitched a very good<br />\ngame, and got himself out of many<br />\nbad holes in creditable fashion.<br />\nWedemeyer started the game for<br />\nArmy, and although wild at times<br />\nhe fared very well until the seventh inning, when with three men<br />\non the sacks and one out he was<br />\nforced to give way to Whiteside,<br />\nthe twirler, who held the New<br />\nYork Giants to one hit earlier in<br />\nthe season. He walked the first<br />\nman he pitched to, forcing in.Hopkins' only run.

He got two bingles out<br />\nof four trips to the plate, both of<br />\nthem being slow rollers to third<br />\nbase, which he beat to the initial<br />\nsack with time to spare.

That is the all-important<br />\nquestion; it has often been answered by the President and the War<br />\nDepartment. It is once more answered in an article concerning the<br />\nnew \"Enlisted Training Corps\" for college students, which quotes<br />\nPresident Wilson's statement that \"it would seriously impair America's prospects of success in this war if the supply of highly trained<br />\nmen were unneccessarily diminished.\"<br />\nThe War Departnient, to aid in averting this evil, has instituted<br />\na plan whereby all R. 0. T. C. men of eighteen or over will next year<br />\nbe members of the Army of the United States, liable to active duty<br />\nat the call of the President. One of the main objects of this scheme<br />\nis \"to prevent unnecessary and wasteful depletion of the colleges<br />\nthrough indiscriminate volunteering, by offering to the students a<br />\ndefinite and immediate military status.\" The wish, then, of your<br />\ngovernment, college men, is for you to continue your education and<br />\nbecome an officer or at least a highly trained man. Though the<br />\nsoldier's life with its glamor is not immediately entered upon, the<br />\ngreatest service you can render your country is to enlist in this new<br />\nR. 0. T. C. Let us hope that next year every physically fit undergraduate will enroll in this branch of the service.<br />\n. In regard to those who fail to avail themselves of an opportunity to return to college, merely because they are making \"good<br />\nmoney,\" we would say that such a course is unwise to the highest<br />\ndegree. Work this summer by all means and give the best that is<br />\nin you, but do not let the lure of the present high salaries draw you<br />\nfrom your duty at college, where you can get that military knowledge and scientific training needed so much by the government.<br />\nMoreover, after the war the large salaries are obliged to decrease,<br />\nbecause of the falling off in demand for and the increase in supply<br />\nof this kind of labor. Then the man who has left college will fully<br />\nappreciate his lack of training, for instead of holding plates in position for the riveter he might have been drawing plans for ships.<br />\nTraditions.<br />\nWhen one visits the Military and Naval Academies, he is impressed with the value and beauty of their military traditions.

It is with a feeling of forensic disappointment that we read<br />\nhis summary; where premises are<br />\nso uniformly unsound, it is no<br />\ntest of metal to meet his arguments.

As this seems to be the first<br />\ntime that a Chinese student has<br />\ntaken an .active part at a Senior<br />\nBanquet, and as his talk was most<br />\nenthusiastically received by the<br />\nseniors, it follows in part:<br />\n\"As I am standing before you<br />\ntonight on this memorable occasion, it excites in me almost simultaneously two irresistible feelings\u2014the feeling of joy and the<br />\nfeeling of sorrow; of joy because<br />\nit is our privilege, especially<br />\nmine, to be able to complete our<br />\nacademic study at the Johns Hopkins University, the seat of learning and an institution so pregnant with intellectual atmosphere; of sorrow because from<br />\nnow on we will be separated all<br />\nover the world and engaged in<br />\ndifferent lines of activity, and our<br />\nold college days will be but a<br />\nsweet memory.<br />\n\"Of the class of 1918, which I<br />\nlove so much, I am the only student from the Orient.
