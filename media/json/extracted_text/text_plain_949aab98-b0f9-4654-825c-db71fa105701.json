The Council has<br />\nheld open forums on the areas of University life that<br />\nundergraduates have bitched about over coffee in<br />\nLevering for years.<br />\nBut no one has come. Not to the forum on housing nor<br />\nthe one on curriculum. Not even coeducation. And<br />\ngovernance? Certainly not. As for the undergraduate<br />\nhearings...the record attendance has been ten.<br />\nPresident Gordon showed up at one of those hearings<br />\nWednesday night and reported that the Academic<br />\nCouncil had rejected Professor Lynn's proposal for a<br />\nHomewood college. Ground rule number one is that no<br />\none must usurp the power of the Academic Council.<br />\nWhether the new governance system passes or not, the<br />\nAcademic \u2022Council has the final word.<br />\nSince what the Council says, goes, the Lynn plan is<br />\ndead. Funeral arrangements are pending, however,<br />\nsince there aren't enough mourners to carry the coffin.<br />\nHopkins undergraduates spend most of their political<br />\ntime condeming the silent majority. But they spend<br />\nmost of the rest of their time silently showing faculty<br />\nand administrators that they don't care about their<br />\neducation'or their freedoms. Isn't money analogous to<br />\ngrades?<br />\nIncidentally, President Gordon was smiling his usual<br />\ndiplomatic smile when he announced that the Lynn plan<br />\nwas dead. He can smile because he knows that it doesn't<br />\nmatter. Things can only matter if there are people<br />\naround who care enough to be hurt...or maybe just'<br />\nenough to lick their wounds.<br />\nApparently, there aren't.<br />\n<br />\nThe Symposium<br />\nThe fourth annual Milton S.

The<br />\nSymposium has improved with age, and this year's<br />\n\"Perspectives on Violence,\" shapes up as no exception.<br />\nIt offers a welcomed escape from textbook learning as<br />\nwell as a chance to hear and speak with men who look at<br />\na problem from perspectives different than our own.<br />\nThis year it may also act as.a tool to show what<br />\nHopkins has to offer. If the speakers are as good as their<br />\nnames and the dialogue sharp and precise, the Symposium may be broadcast nationally by the educational<br />\ntelevision network.<br />\nThat's no reason, however, to wait to catch it on<br />\ntelevision. So, make it over to Shriver Hall and catch one<br />\nof the best things that Hopkins has to offer in person.<br />\n<br />\nRACIST ATTITUDES<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe article in Tuesday's<br />\nissue of the News-Letter<br />\nentitled \"Howard Blues: A<br />\nLong Time Comin' \" was<br />\nexemplary of the racist attitudes which run rampant<br />\nthroughout the Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter staff. It was<br />\nobvious from this article that<br />\nyour reporter had no experience with blues, and was<br />\ntotally ignorant on the subject<br />\nof Black people in general.<br />\nThe article contained little<br />\nfactual value, but was rather<br />\nwell-spiced with stereotypes<br />\nabout Black people which<br />\nwere prevalent in the South<br />\nbefore the Civil War. It seems<br />\nas if the Hopkins News-Letter<br />\noffice has taken upon itself<br />\nthe responsibility of keeping<br />\nthe stereotypes alive, singlehandedly, in the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nThis is not the first time<br />\nthat the Black students of this<br />\nschool have been offended by<br />\nexamples of racism in the<br />\nNews-Letter. It is more the<br />\nrule than the exception. In<br />\narticles appearing last spring<br />\nconcerning admissions, and<br />\nlast October on the Black<br />\nBlack<br />\nUnion,<br />\nStudent<br />\nstudents and administrators<br />\nobject<br />\nof<br />\nwere<br />\nthe<br />\nmisquotation, misrepresentation and overt racism on the part of the<br />\nHopkins News-Letter.<br />\nThe Black students at this<br />\nUniversity are growing increasingly intolerant of the<br />\nNews- Letter staff, and<br />\nrecognize it to be the home of<br />\nand<br />\nsuperiority<br />\nwhite<br />\ntraditional Southern racist<br />\nideas on campus. For too long<br />\nBlack people have been<br />\ncheated and deceived by<br />\nmedia<br />\nin<br />\nprejudiced<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nWe therefore suggest to you<br />\nthat if you cannot report<br />\naccurately and objectively on<br />\nBlack people at Hopkins, or<br />\nanywhere else, that you<br />\nacknowledge your ignorance<br />\nand omit this topic from the<br />\ntext of your News-Letter.<br />\nThe Black Students<br />\nPANNED AGAIN<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI'm afraid your selection of<br />\na \"music critic\" has been<br />\nmost unfortunate. The piano<br />\nrecital of Mr. Stephen Bishop<br />\nlast Sunday evening was an<br />\nevent to remember for its<br />\nartistic excellence. Mr.<br />\nto<br />\napproach<br />\nBishop's<br />\nBeethoven was intensely<br />\npersonal, yet he was able to<br />\nconvey to thOse who listened<br />\nmore vitality and unmost<br />\nderstanding than<br />\ncomtemporary pianists.<br />\nHis phrasing was musical<br />\nwithout an ounce of Romantic<br />\nfat, extremely important for<br />\na proper interpretation of<br />\nBeethoven. Indeed, this artist<br />\nat thirty plays like a master<br />\nof twice that age, a virtuoso in<br />\nthe grade line. I suggest if<br />\nyour critic doubts the<br />\nauthenticity of Mr. Bishop's<br />\ndynamic and rhythmic in-<br />\n<br />\ntrepretations he should follow<br />\nthe score when the concert is<br />\nbroadcast over radio station<br />\nWBJC-FM in January.<br />\nThe only possible criticism<br />\nthat could be leveled against<br />\nMr. Bishop was that he did<br />\nnot perform the original<br />\nunedited versions of the<br />\nsonatas (Kalmus edition).<br />\nAs far as the piano was<br />\nconcerned, I must admit that<br />\nwas unfortunate. The office of<br />\nSpecial Events spent a great<br />\ndeal of money to rent that<br />\npiano especially for the<br />\nconcert. The Steinway people<br />\nshould be more careful of the<br />\nquality of their rental instruments.<br />\nHowever, whatever can be<br />\nsaid against that piano, it can<br />\nnot be said it was out of tune.<br />\nAn individual need not have<br />\nperfect pitch to realize that.<br />\nI suggest, Mr. Editor, that<br />\nyou either give Mr. Flax a<br />\nmusical education before the<br />\nnext concert or get a new<br />\nmore qualified music critic.<br />\nJerry F. Green<br />\n<br />\nAmericans. Enough.<br />\nIn his refutation, W. J.<br />\nSakowich infers that Dick<br />\nOles, Fencing Coach, is proAmerican and hence a<br />\nfascist. And by citing a racial<br />\n\"echo\" in Mr. Oles' letter (its<br />\nexistence is debatable), W. J.<br />\nSakowich seems to believe<br />\nthat Mr. Oles is a racist.<br />\nW. J. Sakowich ends his<br />\nprofoundly enlightening tale<br />\nby stating: \"Perhaps if Mr.<br />\nOles took off his fencing<br />\nmask, or walked outside the<br />\ngym once or twice, and talked<br />\nto some real people, he might<br />\nbe able to see the situation<br />\nmore clearly.\"<br />\nThe obvious implication<br />\nhere being that there are no<br />\n\"real\" people in the gym,<br />\nonly fascists, racists, fencing<br />\nproand<br />\ninstructors,<br />\nAmericans. Incredible as it<br />\nmay be, but W. J. Sakowich<br />\nappears to have stumbled on<br />\nan empirical method for<br />\ndistinguishing \"real\" people<br />\nfrom unreal people-a tool<br />\nwhich could prove extremely<br />\nuseful in Philosophy.<br />\nJ. S. Hanas<br />\n<br />\nSAKOWICH<br />\nWAR<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThis letter is in response to<br />\na recently published note<br />\nsubmitted by a W. J.<br />\nSakowich. I would like to<br />\nraise to the surface a few of<br />\nhis implications.<br />\nHe states that \"Nixon's<br />\nshock troops, the CIA, placed<br />\n(a distinct probability) the<br />\nfriendly Asian fascist general<br />\n(pro-American), Lon No!, in<br />\npower.\"<br />\nThe tacit premises here are<br />\nas follows: a.) Fascists are<br />\npro-American; b.) Nixon is<br />\npro- American; c.) Nixon is a<br />\nfascist. W. J. Sakowich<br />\nrelegates fascism to pro-<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was once a student at<br />\nJohns Hopkins and I deeply<br />\nsympathize with students<br />\nresisting conscription.<br />\nWhen the government at<br />\nWashington and the none too<br />\nreligious officers in the<br />\nPentagon are preaching a<br />\nwar of religion against the<br />\nRussian atheists I become<br />\nsuspicious.

The cover is<br />\npretentious and the name is<br />\nunlikely at best.<br />\nNot so for the music though.<br />\n\"Fotheringay\" is a new<br />\ngroup, but all of its members<br />\nseem to be veterans of other<br />\ngroups. It was formed by<br />\nSandy Denny,late of Fairport<br />\nplays<br />\nConvention, who<br />\ntwelve-string guitar and<br />\nsings.<br />\nThe other half of the<br />\ngroup is a fellow named<br />\nTrevor Lucas, who also plays<br />\nguitar and sings. The closest I<br />\ncan come to describing him is<br />\n<br />\nalmost as big as she is. The<br />\nbass, well, it's reliable; Jack<br />\nBruce would be out of place.<br />\nDitto for the drummer.<br />\n<br />\nas Sandy Denny's musical<br />\nalter ego. They sound as<br />\nthough they have been<br />\nplaying together for years.<br />\nThis is not the whole group,<br />\nhowever: just two halves.<br />\nThere are three other guys<br />\nwho lurk in the shadows at the<br />\nback of the stage and play<br />\ntheir respective lead guitar,<br />\nbass, and drums.<br />\nThe bass and lead are both<br />\nvery competent, and in places<br />\neven inventive, but the impression one gets is that they<br />\nwere instructed to keep a low<br />\nprofile and not to try to rob<br />\nany limelight.<br />\nDespite all , the lead<br />\nguitarist does manage to get<br />\noff a couple of pretty flashy<br />\nriffs before succumbing to the<br />\nonslaught of Sandy Denny's<br />\ntwelve stringer, which is<br />\n<br />\nGracie in a Good Mood<br />\nThe record's long suit is<br />\nvocals. Sandy Denny's voice<br />\nis above all pleasing to the<br />\near, which goes a long way.<br />\nSometimes she sounds<br />\nexactly like Judy Collins,<br />\nsometimes like Grace Slick in<br />\none of her better moods (Not<br />\nthis \"doesn't mean shit to a<br />\ntree\" jive), sometimes just<br />\nlike the Fairport Convention<br />\nSandy Denny minus some of<br />\nthe rougher edges.<br />\nTrevor Lucas sings just like<br />\nSandy Denny, except in a<br />\nbaritone instead of a soprano.<br />\nHe never loses control, and<br />\n<br />\nseems to be most at home in<br />\nEnglish folk music-ballad<br />\ntype of things. The harmony<br />\nbetween the two is good, not<br />\noverdone to the lengths<br />\nfavored by, for instance,<br />\nSimon and Garfunkel. To his<br />\ncredit, Lucas has the best song<br />\nof the album, the Ballad of<br />\nNedKelly,which deals,I think,<br />\nwith the exploits of an Irish<br />\nhighwayman..<br />\nUbiquitous Dylan<br />\nThe selection of songs is<br />\n\u2014pretty conventional for this<br />\nsort of album. There is a<br />\nGordon Lightfoot number,<br />\nThe Way I Feel, and the<br />\nlesser-known<br />\nubiquitous<br />\nDylan number, in this case<br />\nToo Much Of Nothing, and a<br />\ntraditional English folk song<br />\nin newer clothes, called<br />\nBanks of the Nile.<br />\n<br />\nverything else is either<br />\nDenny or Lucas or both.<br />\nIt is one of those albums<br />\nin which none of the cuts are<br />\nparticularly better or worse<br />\nthan the others, with the<br />\nnotable exception of the<br />\nBallad of Ned Kelly.<br />\nalbum,<br />\nfirst<br />\nFor a<br />\n\"Fotheringay\" is a fine piece<br />\nof work.

The Council has<br />\nheld open forums on the areas of University life that<br />\nundergraduates have bitched about over coffee in<br />\nLevering for years.<br />\nBut no one has come. Not to the forum on housing nor<br />\nthe one on curriculum. Not even coeducation. And<br />\ngovernance? Certainly not. As for the undergraduate<br />\nhearings...the record attendance has been ten.<br />\nPresident Gordon showed up at one of those hearings<br />\nWednesday night and reported that the Academic<br />\nCouncil had rejected Professor Lynn's proposal for a<br />\nHomewood college. Ground rule number one is that no<br />\none must usurp the power of the Academic Council.<br />\nWhether the new governance system passes or not, the<br />\nAcademic \u2022Council has the final word.<br />\nSince what the Council says, goes, the Lynn plan is<br />\ndead. Funeral arrangements are pending, however,<br />\nsince there aren't enough mourners to carry the coffin.<br />\nHopkins undergraduates spend most of their political<br />\ntime condeming the silent majority. But they spend<br />\nmost of the rest of their time silently showing faculty<br />\nand administrators that they don't care about their<br />\neducation'or their freedoms. Isn't money analogous to<br />\ngrades?<br />\nIncidentally, President Gordon was smiling his usual<br />\ndiplomatic smile when he announced that the Lynn plan<br />\nwas dead. He can smile because he knows that it doesn't<br />\nmatter. Things can only matter if there are people<br />\naround who care enough to be hurt...or maybe just'<br />\nenough to lick their wounds.<br />\nApparently, there aren't.<br /><br />\nThe Symposium<br />\nThe fourth annual Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium is<br />\noff to a fine start thanks to the hard work of its cochairmen Stephen Mahinka and Dean Rudoy. The<br />\nSymposium has improved with age, and this year's<br />\n\"Perspectives on Violence,\" shapes up as no exception.<br />\nIt offers a welcomed escape from textbook learning as<br />\nwell as a chance to hear and speak with men who look at<br />\na problem from perspectives different than our own.<br />\nThis year it may also act as.a tool to show what<br />\nHopkins has to offer. If the speakers are as good as their<br />\nnames and the dialogue sharp and precise, the Symposium may be broadcast nationally by the educational<br />\ntelevision network.<br />\nThat's no reason, however, to wait to catch it on<br />\ntelevision. So, make it over to Shriver Hall and catch one<br />\nof the best things that Hopkins has to offer in person.<br /><br />\nRACIST ATTITUDES<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe article in Tuesday's<br />\nissue of the News-Letter<br />\nentitled \"Howard Blues: A<br />\nLong Time Comin' \" was<br />\nexemplary of the racist attitudes which run rampant<br />\nthroughout the Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter staff. It was<br />\nobvious from this article that<br />\nyour reporter had no experience with blues, and was<br />\ntotally ignorant on the subject<br />\nof Black people in general.<br />\nThe article contained little<br />\nfactual value, but was rather<br />\nwell-spiced with stereotypes<br />\nabout Black people which<br />\nwere prevalent in the South<br />\nbefore the Civil War. It seems<br />\nas if the Hopkins News-Letter<br />\noffice has taken upon itself<br />\nthe responsibility of keeping<br />\nthe stereotypes alive, singlehandedly, in the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nThis is not the first time<br />\nthat the Black students of this<br />\nschool have been offended by<br />\nexamples of racism in the<br />\nNews-Letter. It is more the<br />\nrule than the exception.

For too long<br />\nBlack people have been<br />\ncheated and deceived by<br />\nmedia<br />\nin<br />\nprejudiced<br />\nAmerica.<br />\nWe therefore suggest to you<br />\nthat if you cannot report<br />\naccurately and objectively on<br />\nBlack people at Hopkins, or<br />\nanywhere else, that you<br />\nacknowledge your ignorance<br />\nand omit this topic from the<br />\ntext of your News-Letter.<br />\nThe Black Students<br />\nPANNED AGAIN<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI'm afraid your selection of<br />\na \"music critic\" has been<br />\nmost unfortunate. The piano<br />\nrecital of Mr. Stephen Bishop<br />\nlast Sunday evening was an<br />\nevent to remember for its<br />\nartistic excellence. Mr.<br />\nto<br />\napproach<br />\nBishop's<br />\nBeethoven was intensely<br />\npersonal, yet he was able to<br />\nconvey to thOse who listened<br />\nmore vitality and unmost<br />\nderstanding than<br />\ncomtemporary pianists.<br />\nHis phrasing was musical<br />\nwithout an ounce of Romantic<br />\nfat, extremely important for<br />\na proper interpretation of<br />\nBeethoven. Indeed, this artist<br />\nat thirty plays like a master<br />\nof twice that age, a virtuoso in<br />\nthe grade line. I suggest if<br />\nyour critic doubts the<br />\nauthenticity of Mr. Bishop's<br />\ndynamic and rhythmic in-<br /><br />\ntrepretations he should follow<br />\nthe score when the concert is<br />\nbroadcast over radio station<br />\nWBJC-FM in January.<br />\nThe only possible criticism<br />\nthat could be leveled against<br />\nMr. Bishop was that he did<br />\nnot perform the original<br />\nunedited versions of the<br />\nsonatas (Kalmus edition).<br />\nAs far as the piano was<br />\nconcerned, I must admit that<br />\nwas unfortunate. The office of<br />\nSpecial Events spent a great<br />\ndeal of money to rent that<br />\npiano especially for the<br />\nconcert. The Steinway people<br />\nshould be more careful of the<br />\nquality of their rental instruments.<br />\nHowever, whatever can be<br />\nsaid against that piano, it can<br />\nnot be said it was out of tune.<br />\nAn individual need not have<br />\nperfect pitch to realize that.<br />\nI suggest, Mr. Editor, that<br />\nyou either give Mr. Flax a<br />\nmusical education before the<br />\nnext concert or get a new<br />\nmore qualified music critic.<br />\nJerry F. Green<br /><br />\nAmericans. Enough.<br />\nIn his refutation, W. J.<br />\nSakowich infers that Dick<br />\nOles, Fencing Coach, is proAmerican and hence a<br />\nfascist. And by citing a racial<br />\n\"echo\" in Mr. Oles' letter (its<br />\nexistence is debatable), W. J.<br />\nSakowich seems to believe<br />\nthat Mr. Oles is a racist.<br />\nW. J. Sakowich ends his<br />\nprofoundly enlightening tale<br />\nby stating: \"Perhaps if Mr.<br />\nOles took off his fencing<br />\nmask, or walked outside the<br />\ngym once or twice, and talked<br />\nto some real people, he might<br />\nbe able to see the situation<br />\nmore clearly.\"<br />\nThe obvious implication<br />\nhere being that there are no<br />\n\"real\" people in the gym,<br />\nonly fascists, racists, fencing<br />\nproand<br />\ninstructors,<br />\nAmericans. Incredible as it<br />\nmay be, but W. J. Sakowich<br />\nappears to have stumbled on<br />\nan empirical method for<br />\ndistinguishing \"real\" people<br />\nfrom unreal people-a tool<br />\nwhich could prove extremely<br />\nuseful in Philosophy.<br />\nJ. S. Hanas<br /><br />\nSAKOWICH<br />\nWAR<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThis letter is in response to<br />\na recently published note<br />\nsubmitted by a W. J.<br />\nSakowich. I would like to<br />\nraise to the surface a few of<br />\nhis implications.<br />\nHe states that \"Nixon's<br />\nshock troops, the CIA, placed<br />\n(a distinct probability) the<br />\nfriendly Asian fascist general<br />\n(pro-American), Lon No!, in<br />\npower.\"<br />\nThe tacit premises here are<br />\nas follows: a.) Fascists are<br />\npro-American; b.) Nixon is<br />\npro- American; c.) Nixon is a<br />\nfascist. W. J.

The cover is<br />\npretentious and the name is<br />\nunlikely at best.<br />\nNot so for the music though.<br />\n\"Fotheringay\" is a new<br />\ngroup, but all of its members<br />\nseem to be veterans of other<br />\ngroups. It was formed by<br />\nSandy Denny,late of Fairport<br />\nplays<br />\nConvention, who<br />\ntwelve-string guitar and<br />\nsings.<br />\nThe other half of the<br />\ngroup is a fellow named<br />\nTrevor Lucas, who also plays<br />\nguitar and sings. The closest I<br />\ncan come to describing him is<br /><br />\nalmost as big as she is. The<br />\nbass, well, it's reliable; Jack<br />\nBruce would be out of place.<br />\nDitto for the drummer.<br /><br />\nas Sandy Denny's musical<br />\nalter ego. They sound as<br />\nthough they have been<br />\nplaying together for years.<br />\nThis is not the whole group,<br />\nhowever: just two halves.<br />\nThere are three other guys<br />\nwho lurk in the shadows at the<br />\nback of the stage and play<br />\ntheir respective lead guitar,<br />\nbass, and drums.<br />\nThe bass and lead are both<br />\nvery competent, and in places<br />\neven inventive, but the impression one gets is that they<br />\nwere instructed to keep a low<br />\nprofile and not to try to rob<br />\nany limelight.<br />\nDespite all , the lead<br />\nguitarist does manage to get<br />\noff a couple of pretty flashy<br />\nriffs before succumbing to the<br />\nonslaught of Sandy Denny's<br />\ntwelve stringer, which is<br /><br />\nGracie in a Good Mood<br />\nThe record's long suit is<br />\nvocals. Sandy Denny's voice<br />\nis above all pleasing to the<br />\near, which goes a long way.<br />\nSometimes she sounds<br />\nexactly like Judy Collins,<br />\nsometimes like Grace Slick in<br />\none of her better moods (Not<br />\nthis \"doesn't mean shit to a<br />\ntree\" jive), sometimes just<br />\nlike the Fairport Convention<br />\nSandy Denny minus some of<br />\nthe rougher edges.<br />\nTrevor Lucas sings just like<br />\nSandy Denny, except in a<br />\nbaritone instead of a soprano.<br />\nHe never loses control, and<br /><br />\nseems to be most at home in<br />\nEnglish folk music-ballad<br />\ntype of things. The harmony<br />\nbetween the two is good, not<br />\noverdone to the lengths<br />\nfavored by, for instance,<br />\nSimon and Garfunkel. To his<br />\ncredit, Lucas has the best song<br />\nof the album, the Ballad of<br />\nNedKelly,which deals,I think,<br />\nwith the exploits of an Irish<br />\nhighwayman..<br />\nUbiquitous Dylan<br />\nThe selection of songs is<br />\n\u2014pretty conventional for this<br />\nsort of album. There is a<br />\nGordon Lightfoot number,<br />\nThe Way I Feel, and the<br />\nlesser-known<br />\nubiquitous<br />\nDylan number, in this case<br />\nToo Much Of Nothing, and a<br />\ntraditional English folk song<br />\nin newer clothes, called<br />\nBanks of the Nile.<br /><br />\nverything else is either<br />\nDenny or Lucas or both.<br />\nIt is one of those albums<br />\nin which none of the cuts are<br />\nparticularly better or worse<br />\nthan the others, with the<br />\nnotable exception of the<br />\nBallad of Ned Kelly.<br />\nalbum,<br />\nfirst<br />\nFor a<br />\n\"Fotheringay\" is a fine piece<br />\nof work.
