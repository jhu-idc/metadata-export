With first<br />\nplace in the 30-yard dash and in the<br />\nbroad jump, and second in the<br />\nhurdles, he contributed 13 points<br />\nto his team's total. In the first heat<br />\nof the 30- yard dash Penniman<br />\nequalled the cage record of 3.,y<br />\nseconds.<br />\nOther men who also deserve especial notice. are: Binford, who won<br />\nthree seconds for the freshmen in<br />\na most clever manner; Brooks, who<br />\nwon the shot put with ease and who<br />\nalso showed to advantage in the<br />\n30-yard dash; Hall and Gorman,<br />\nwinners of the half and the mile, respectively; and Captain Melamet of<br />\nthe sophs, who ran a wonderful race<br />\nin the quarter.<br />\nThe feature event, from the spectator's standpoint, however, was the<br />\nsenior-junior relay race. This was<br />\nmost exciting and drew great applause. The juniors repeated their<br />\nsuccess of two years ago when,<br />\nas freshmen, they defeated 1914.<br />\nThe sophomore-freshmen race was<br />\neasily won by 1917.<br />\nThe meet started with the heats<br />\nof the 30-yard dash, which were all<br />\nfast and closely contested. The<br />\nsecond event was the high jump,<br />\nand in it the sophs drew first blood,<br />\nNelson and Iddings tying at 5 feet<br />\n4 inches. They increased their lead<br />\nwhen Penniman captured the 30yard event immediately afterward.<br />\nThe fourth event was the 44o.<br />\nMelamet drew the pole and kept<br />\nthe lead from the start, although<br />\nBinford made several game efforts<br />\nto pass him. The sophs were now<br />\nleading by a score of 18 to 6.<br />\nThe freshies pulled up considerably, however, in the shot put,<br />\nwhich was the next event; Brooks<br />\nand Kaiser taking first and second,<br />\nrespectively. The sixth event was<br />\nthe 88o-yard run. Hall took the<br />\nlead at the start, with Straus, WebbPeploe, Hayes and Hutton following in thc,order named. Hall was<br />\nrunning easily and Hutton appeared<br />\nto be taking his time. This continued for the first six laps, when<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nDR.

A., Secretary of the South, on<br />\nWednesday and Friday of last week,<br />\ngave two straight-from-the-shoulder talks to the undergraduate body.<br />\nBefore his talk on Wednesday,<br />\na light lunch was served by the Association, consisting of sandwiches,<br />\ncocoa, oranges and Wagnerian cake.<br />\nDr. Brush introduced Dr. Weatherford, who spoke on the inability<br />\nof a man to make good without the<br />\npower of a clean life behind him.<br />\nThe talk on Thursday was postponed to Friday, at twelve, to avoid<br />\nconflicting with Dr. Lomax.<br />\nDr. Weatherford, in his final talk,<br />\nurged the men of power and<br />\nstrength in college to stand up for<br />\nthe right, no matter against what<br />\nodds\u2014to become pillars of strength<br />\naround which their weaker fellows<br />\nmight rally. He enlivened his talk<br />\nby instances from actual college<br />\nlife. His practical advice will be<br />\ngratefully remembered by all the<br />\nmen who heard him.<br />\nDuring his stay in Baltimore, Dr.<br />\nWeatherford visited several of the<br />\nHopkins fraternities, where he was<br />\nable to talk to the men in a more<br />\nintimate and personal way than<br />\nfrom the platform.<br />\nriutton, with a splendid spurt,<br />\npulled up to second. From then on<br />\nhe and Hall easily outdistanced the<br />\nothers. Both finished strong, Hall<br />\nleading by 15 yards. The 30-yard<br />\nhurdles, which followed, was fast<br />\nand close; Fulton just nosing Penniman out. The score was now tied<br />\n(24 to 24) and the crowd was much<br />\nexcited.<br />\nThe sophs went ahead by two<br />\npoints in the broad jump; Penniman beating Binford by about half<br />\na foot. The mile run, which followed, decided the meet however,<br />\nfor the freshmen won both places.<br />\nit was a most interesting race. For<br />\nthe first 12 laps the lead see-sawed<br />\nbetween Beck, Niles and Weech,<br />\nwith the others in a bunch. About<br />\nthen Gorman and Hall began to<br />\npull up and came within easy striking distance of the leaders. Hayes<br />\nand Read were also near the front<br />\nand running well. On the fifteenth<br />\nlap Hayes jumped into first, with<br />\nNiles and. Weech following. Beck<br />\nwas fast dropping back. On the<br />\nseventeenth lap Gorman and Hall<br />\nbegan to sprint and Weech was the<br />\nonly one of the early leaders who<br />\ncould stand the pace.

With first<br />\nplace in the 30-yard dash and in the<br />\nbroad jump, and second in the<br />\nhurdles, he contributed 13 points<br />\nto his team's total. In the first heat<br />\nof the 30- yard dash Penniman<br />\nequalled the cage record of 3.,y<br />\nseconds.<br />\nOther men who also deserve especial notice. are: Binford, who won<br />\nthree seconds for the freshmen in<br />\na most clever manner; Brooks, who<br />\nwon the shot put with ease and who<br />\nalso showed to advantage in the<br />\n30-yard dash; Hall and Gorman,<br />\nwinners of the half and the mile, respectively; and Captain Melamet of<br />\nthe sophs, who ran a wonderful race<br />\nin the quarter.<br />\nThe feature event, from the spectator's standpoint, however, was the<br />\nsenior-junior relay race. This was<br />\nmost exciting and drew great applause. The juniors repeated their<br />\nsuccess of two years ago when,<br />\nas freshmen, they defeated 1914.<br />\nThe sophomore-freshmen race was<br />\neasily won by 1917.<br />\nThe meet started with the heats<br />\nof the 30-yard dash, which were all<br />\nfast and closely contested. The<br />\nsecond event was the high jump,<br />\nand in it the sophs drew first blood,<br />\nNelson and Iddings tying at 5 feet<br />\n4 inches. They increased their lead<br />\nwhen Penniman captured the 30yard event immediately afterward.<br />\nThe fourth event was the 44o.<br />\nMelamet drew the pole and kept<br />\nthe lead from the start, although<br />\nBinford made several game efforts<br />\nto pass him. The sophs were now<br />\nleading by a score of 18 to 6.<br />\nThe freshies pulled up considerably, however, in the shot put,<br />\nwhich was the next event; Brooks<br />\nand Kaiser taking first and second,<br />\nrespectively. The sixth event was<br />\nthe 88o-yard run. Hall took the<br />\nlead at the start, with Straus, WebbPeploe, Hayes and Hutton following in thc,order named. Hall was<br />\nrunning easily and Hutton appeared<br />\nto be taking his time. This continued for the first six laps, when<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nDR.

He enlivened his talk<br />\nby instances from actual college<br />\nlife. His practical advice will be<br />\ngratefully remembered by all the<br />\nmen who heard him.<br />\nDuring his stay in Baltimore, Dr.<br />\nWeatherford visited several of the<br />\nHopkins fraternities, where he was<br />\nable to talk to the men in a more<br />\nintimate and personal way than<br />\nfrom the platform.<br />\nriutton, with a splendid spurt,<br />\npulled up to second. From then on<br />\nhe and Hall easily outdistanced the<br />\nothers. Both finished strong, Hall<br />\nleading by 15 yards. The 30-yard<br />\nhurdles, which followed, was fast<br />\nand close; Fulton just nosing Penniman out. The score was now tied<br />\n(24 to 24) and the crowd was much<br />\nexcited.<br />\nThe sophs went ahead by two<br />\npoints in the broad jump; Penniman beating Binford by about half<br />\na foot. The mile run, which followed, decided the meet however,<br />\nfor the freshmen won both places.<br />\nit was a most interesting race. For<br />\nthe first 12 laps the lead see-sawed<br />\nbetween Beck, Niles and Weech,<br />\nwith the others in a bunch. About<br />\nthen Gorman and Hall began to<br />\npull up and came within easy striking distance of the leaders. Hayes<br />\nand Read were also near the front<br />\nand running well.
