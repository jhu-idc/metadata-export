With the advent of<br />\nPresident Goodnow speculation increased, and despite the statement<br />\nof Mr. R. Brent Keyser, made<br />\nearlier in the year, that there was<br />\npractically no chance of Hopkins<br />\nmoving out to Homewood in 1915,<br />\nwithin the last two months .a new<br />\nreport has been circulated almost<br />\nevery day.<br />\nThe statement of President Goodnow has settled once for all the<br />\nsuspense which has pervaded Hopkins ever since it was definitely<br />\nknown that I romewood was to be<br />\nthe University's future home. It<br />\nis an announcement which will be<br />\nenthusiastically welcomed by every<br />\nHopkins student and every Hopkins<br />\nalumnus.<br />\nThe date is definite and final.<br />\nThere are I10 conditions to be fulfilled or developments to be awaited;<br />\nunless something occurs which is<br />\nentirely outside of the range of<br />\nprobable events, Hopkins will be at<br />\nHomewood in 1916.<br />\nPresident Goodnow stated that it<br />\nis doubtful, if, at the time of removal, any more buildings will be<br />\nstanding at Homewood than are<br />\nthere at the present time. The<br />\nlaboratories at the present site will<br />\nbe used ; but the President declared<br />\nthat this will in no wax' interfere<br />\nwith the work of the University.<br />\nThe only building which is at all<br />\nlikely to be erected before 1916 is<br />\nthe Chemical Laboratory and the<br />\nbuilding of this structure before<br />\nthat date is highly provisional. It<br />\ndepends, in fact, upon the chances<br />\nof any gifts being made to the University within the course of next<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe President stated emphatically<br />\nthat the present financial condition<br />\nof the University would not permit<br />\nof any new buildings being erected<br />\nbefore removal, and that all hopes<br />\nof some structures at Homewood<br />\nbefore 1916 depended upon the<br />\ngenerosity of the public.<br />\nThe fact that the laboratories on<br />\nMonument street will be used in no<br />\nway lessens the importance of President Goodnow's announcement.<br />\n<br />\nrj<br />\nPRICE FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., MAY 17, 1915.<br />\n<br />\nVOL.

Until the eighth inning the 'Varsity led St. John's 4<br />\nto o, but at the very last the Soldiers<br />\ntook a brace and were able to push<br />\none run over in the eighth, and two<br />\nmore in the ninth. Then Defandorf<br />\nsettled down and ended the game<br />\nby striking out the last batter.<br />\nBill Noble, who has helped Hopkins will so many of its games this<br />\nyear by his catching and wonderful<br />\nhitting, was not in the line-up; but<br />\nRoger Howell, who was shifted<br />\nfrom first to behind the bat caught<br />\na very good game.<br />\nThis victory gives Hopkins a<br />\nclaim on the State championship, as<br />\nall their defeats this season have<br />\nbeen at the hands of teams from<br />\nother States. The Black and Blue<br />\nstarted the game with a rush,<br />\npushing three runs over in the<br />\nsecond inning. Ewing walked.<br />\nLednutri sent a pop fly to third and<br />\nEwing stole second. Then after<br />\nEgerton had struck out, Howell<br />\ncame through with a single to center, scoring Ewing. Defandorf was<br />\nsafe on a hit back of second.<br />\nWorthington then pushed over two<br />\nmore runs with a three-bagger, but<br />\nhe was nabbed at the plate trying to<br />\nstretch the hit into a homer.<br />\nEwing really made a homer in<br />\nthe fourth, but was called out for<br />\nnot touching second.<br />\nDefandorf allowed only four hits<br />\nand if his teammates could have<br />\nfielded in perfect style behind him<br />\nhe would have scored a shut-out.<br />\nThe score:<br />\nHopkins.<br />\n<br />\nWorthington, ss<br />\nPorter, 2b.<br />\nButler, Ill<br />\nSutton, c. f.<br />\nEwing, c. f.<br />\nLednum, 3b<br />\nEgerton, r, f.<br />\nHowell, c.<br />\nDefandorf, p<br />\nTotals<br />\nc. f \u2022<br />\nTucker, r. f.<br />\nHeise, ss<br />\nFreeney, r b<br />\nBrown, I. f<br />\nHauver, c<br />\nJarman, 2b<br />\nCassard, 3b<br />\nMatthews, p.<br />\n<br />\nJump,<br />\n<br />\nA.B.

A large estate is<br />\nnot necessary, explained Mr.<br />\nClarke, in order to have such beauty<br />\nspots about the home, and he<br />\nshowed many gardens of small size<br />\nthat, in the charm of their arrangement and coloring, were \"horticultural poems.\"<br />\nSeveral of the gardens displayed<br />\nwere of the formal Italian garden<br />\ntype, but those which won the most<br />\nenthusiastic applause were those<br />\nthat seemed to be \"bits of wild<br />\nwoodland flower beds brought<br />\nhome to grow.\" After the lecture<br />\nan informal reception was held and<br />\nrefreshments served.<br />\nThe Garden Clubs of America<br />\nhave been holding their annual<br />\nmeeting in Baltimore.

The<br />\nsquad is composed of many good<br />\nmen, practically all of whom have<br />\nplayed on scholastic teams, and<br />\nmany of them being ex-captains.<br />\nThe freshmen are particularly<br />\nstrong in the pitching- line, having<br />\nsix available pitchers, every one of<br />\nwhom is making a strong bid for<br />\nsupremacy. The problem of selecting the best man for the rubber<br />\nwill therefore be exceedingly difficult. The pitching staff so far consists of Love,Taylor,Witz, Hollingsworth, Rolker and Cromwell. The<br />\ncandidates for the infield are Egerton, Chalmers, Woodward, Hoffman, Pepper, Sullivan, Cort, Randall, Adams and Evans. Only two<br />\ncatchers, M. J.

Candidates for the outfield are Jacobsen, Kohn, Adams, Sullivan, Miller,<br />\nNelson, Rosenau and Thurman.<br />\nJudging from appearances, the<br />\nFreshman-Sophomore game, scheduled for May 19, will be hotly contested.

Under the guidance of Coach Hooper, and the leadership of Captain Porter, the candidates have rounded out this year<br />\ninto a team which has clearly shown<br />\nthat baseball is rapidly becoming<br />\none of the most important sports at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Coach Hooper is<br />\nto be congratulated on the excellent<br />\nwork he has done with the men.<br />\nIt was largely through his efforts<br />\nthat the team won the championship<br />\nof the State.<br />\nHopkins' most noted athletic<br />\nachievement, however, was the winning of the lacrosse championship<br />\nof the United States. Lacrosse has<br />\nfor several years been the one.<br />\nbranch of athletics in which Johns<br />\nHopkins has been able to cope with<br />\nteams from larger northern colleges, and the fact that the team is<br />\nable to make a good record for itself each season is a point worthy<br />\nof favorable note.<br />\nThe track team, although it was<br />\nhampered at the outset by a marked<br />\nlack of material, has, nevertheless,<br />\nshown up very well in most of its<br />\n'meets, and has finished its season<br />\nin p. highly creditable manner. The<br />\nteam was, with few exceptions,<br />\nmade up of new men, and the train\u2022 ing of the \"green\" material presented to Coach England no mean<br />\ntask. However, the track men, as<br />\nwell as the baseball and lacrosse<br />\nmen, are distinctly to be congratulated on their work this season. It<br />\nhas been a most prosperous athletic<br />\nseason -in -every.-way.-<br />\n<br />\nFinal Preparation for Ceremonies Made.<br />\nNearly all Invitations Answered- Undergraduates to Act as Ushers.<br />\n<br />\nAll plans and arrangements for<br />\nthe inauguration of President Goodnow and the dedication of the Technical School and of Gilman Hall<br />\nhave now been fully completed, and<br />\nthe eventful close of this week is<br />\nbeing awaited with a large degree<br />\nof interest by all who are connected<br />\nwith the University.<br />\nNearly all of the invitations issued by those in charge of the exercises have been answered, and the<br />\npresence of a large number of<br />\nprominent men from all parts of the<br />\ncountry is assured. The Committee on Arrangements is confident<br />\nthat the program that lias been prepared will be most successfully carried out in every detail.<br />\nIt is sincerely hoped that the students of the University, and especially the undergraduates, as they<br />\nalone will be dismissed from their<br />\nregular classes, will manifest their<br />\ninterest in the exercises by volunteering as ushers on Thursday and<br />\nFriday. The ushers will be expected to wear white trousers, a black<br />\nOr blue coat, windsor tie, and black<br />\nshoes. No special arrangements<br />\nwill be made for the accommodation of the students who do not<br />\nvolunteer to act in this official capacity, and they will thus be compelled to find seats in the section of<br />\nThe stand that has been reserved for<br />\nthe general public. The services of<br />\na large number will, however, be<br />\nrequired to assist in the carrying<br />\nout of the program of the first two<br />\ndays, and Allen F. Voshell, of the<br />\nSenior Class, who is in charge of<br />\nthe arrangements that are being<br />\nmade for student participation in<br />\nthe exercises, will be glad to receive the names of any volunteers.<br />\nDr. Ralph Van D. Magoffin,<br />\nsecretary of the Committee on Arrangements, has expressed the desire that as many students as possible shall wear the thoroughly appropriate and seasonal uniform that<br />\nhas been prescribed for the ushers.<br />\nSuch a concerted action would undoubtedly add greatly to the dignity and the official character of the<br />\noccasion, and would be a thoroughly fitting manifestation of the<br />\ngeneral interest that is being taken<br />\nill the affair. The fact that two<br />\nhundred wands, \u2022 decorated with<br />\nblack and blue ribbons, are being<br />\nprepared for the ushers to use as<br />\nsigns of office, and to retain, if they<br />\nso desire, as souvenirs, is a sufficient<br />\nindication that the hearty co-operation of undergraduates is earnestly desired by those in charge of the<br />\nexercises, and that every student of<br />\nthe. University is expected to take<br />\nsome part in the program which<br />\nthey have prepared.<br />\n<br />\nConnolly, Hall and Straus to Go to the<br />\nNorthern Intercollegiates.<br />\n<br />\nIn the election held by the track<br />\nteam immediately after the meet<br />\nlast Saturday, Fred. Hall, '17, was<br />\nunanimously elected captain for<br />\nnext year. Hall has made a good<br />\nrecord this year, running as anchorman on the relay team, and winning<br />\nfirst place in the indoor South Atlantic Championship 88o-yard run.<br />\nand second place in the outdoor<br />\nevent. He had some experience at<br />\nthe game before coming to Hopkins, as point-winner on the track<br />\nteam of the Tonle School. He has<br />\ntwo more years at Hopkins and is<br />\nshowing steady improvement.<br />\nIt was announced Saturday that<br />\nConnolly, Hall and Straus will be<br />\nthe men from the team to go this<br />\nyear to the Northern Intercollegiate Championships, which will be<br />\nheld at Franklin Field, Philadelphia, May 28 and 29. Hopkins is<br />\nthe only member of the Southern<br />\nassociation to belong to the Northern division, and each year she<br />\nsends the three men required to<br />\nhold membership.<br />\nLast year<br />\n\"Freddy\" Lee, in the beautiful<br />\nworld-record making two-mile race,<br />\nplaced and secured a point for Hopkins after leading the race for seven<br />\nand a-half laps. It was hoped that<br />\nBen Tappan would be able to go this<br />\nyear, but he will have to remain in<br />\ntown at \u2022 the time, on account of<br />\nfinal examinations at the Medical<br />\nSchool.<br />\nHullabaloo Nearly Ready.<br />\n<br />\nThe 1915 Hullabaloo Board announces that most of the proof<br />\nreading of the book has been done,<br />\nand that the book will probably be<br />\ndistributed about the twentieth of<br />\nthis month. Business Manager<br />\nSpencer announced last week that<br />\nthose who want a copy of the book<br />\nmust order it at once if they have<br />\nnot already done so. The number<br />\nof books to be printed is to be absolutely limited.<br />\nA very noticeable feature of this<br />\nyear's Hullabaloo is the use of a<br />\nnew style of type. This makes the<br />\nbook distinctly different from those<br />\nof former years.

With the advent of<br />\nPresident Goodnow speculation increased, and despite the statement<br />\nof Mr. R.

Until the eighth inning the 'Varsity led St. John's 4<br />\nto o, but at the very last the Soldiers<br />\ntook a brace and were able to push<br />\none run over in the eighth, and two<br />\nmore in the ninth. Then Defandorf<br />\nsettled down and ended the game<br />\nby striking out the last batter.<br />\nBill Noble, who has helped Hopkins will so many of its games this<br />\nyear by his catching and wonderful<br />\nhitting, was not in the line-up; but<br />\nRoger Howell, who was shifted<br />\nfrom first to behind the bat caught<br />\na very good game.<br />\nThis victory gives Hopkins a<br />\nclaim on the State championship, as<br />\nall their defeats this season have<br />\nbeen at the hands of teams from<br />\nother States. The Black and Blue<br />\nstarted the game with a rush,<br />\npushing three runs over in the<br />\nsecond inning. Ewing walked.<br />\nLednutri sent a pop fly to third and<br />\nEwing stole second. Then after<br />\nEgerton had struck out, Howell<br />\ncame through with a single to center, scoring Ewing. Defandorf was<br />\nsafe on a hit back of second.<br />\nWorthington then pushed over two<br />\nmore runs with a three-bagger, but<br />\nhe was nabbed at the plate trying to<br />\nstretch the hit into a homer.<br />\nEwing really made a homer in<br />\nthe fourth, but was called out for<br />\nnot touching second.<br />\nDefandorf allowed only four hits<br />\nand if his teammates could have<br />\nfielded in perfect style behind him<br />\nhe would have scored a shut-out.<br />\nThe score:<br />\nHopkins.<br /><br />\nWorthington, ss<br />\nPorter, 2b.<br />\nButler, Ill<br />\nSutton, c. f.<br />\nEwing, c. f.<br />\nLednum, 3b<br />\nEgerton, r, f.<br />\nHowell, c.<br />\nDefandorf, p<br />\nTotals<br />\nc. f \u2022<br />\nTucker, r. f.<br />\nHeise, ss<br />\nFreeney, r b<br />\nBrown, I. f<br />\nHauver, c<br />\nJarman, 2b<br />\nCassard, 3b<br />\nMatthews, p.<br /><br />\nJump,<br /><br />\nA.B.

A large estate is<br />\nnot necessary, explained Mr.<br />\nClarke, in order to have such beauty<br />\nspots about the home, and he<br />\nshowed many gardens of small size<br />\nthat, in the charm of their arrangement and coloring, were \"horticultural poems.\"<br />\nSeveral of the gardens displayed<br />\nwere of the formal Italian garden<br />\ntype, but those which won the most<br />\nenthusiastic applause were those<br />\nthat seemed to be \"bits of wild<br />\nwoodland flower beds brought<br />\nhome to grow.\" After the lecture<br />\nan informal reception was held and<br />\nrefreshments served.<br />\nThe Garden Clubs of America<br />\nhave been holding their annual<br />\nmeeting in Baltimore.

The problem of selecting the best man for the rubber<br />\nwill therefore be exceedingly difficult. The pitching staff so far consists of Love,Taylor,Witz, Hollingsworth, Rolker and Cromwell. The<br />\ncandidates for the infield are Egerton, Chalmers, Woodward, Hoffman, Pepper, Sullivan, Cort, Randall, Adams and Evans. Only two<br />\ncatchers, M. J.

Under the guidance of Coach Hooper, and the leadership of Captain Porter, the candidates have rounded out this year<br />\ninto a team which has clearly shown<br />\nthat baseball is rapidly becoming<br />\none of the most important sports at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Coach Hooper is<br />\nto be congratulated on the excellent<br />\nwork he has done with the men.<br />\nIt was largely through his efforts<br />\nthat the team won the championship<br />\nof the State.<br />\nHopkins' most noted athletic<br />\nachievement, however, was the winning of the lacrosse championship<br />\nof the United States. Lacrosse has<br />\nfor several years been the one.<br />\nbranch of athletics in which Johns<br />\nHopkins has been able to cope with<br />\nteams from larger northern colleges, and the fact that the team is<br />\nable to make a good record for itself each season is a point worthy<br />\nof favorable note.<br />\nThe track team, although it was<br />\nhampered at the outset by a marked<br />\nlack of material, has, nevertheless,<br />\nshown up very well in most of its<br />\n'meets, and has finished its season<br />\nin p. highly creditable manner. The<br />\nteam was, with few exceptions,<br />\nmade up of new men, and the train\u2022 ing of the \"green\" material presented to Coach England no mean<br />\ntask. However, the track men, as<br />\nwell as the baseball and lacrosse<br />\nmen, are distinctly to be congratulated on their work this season. It<br />\nhas been a most prosperous athletic<br />\nseason -in -every.-way.-<br /><br />\nFinal Preparation for Ceremonies Made.<br />\nNearly all Invitations Answered- Undergraduates to Act as Ushers.<br /><br />\nAll plans and arrangements for<br />\nthe inauguration of President Goodnow and the dedication of the Technical School and of Gilman Hall<br />\nhave now been fully completed, and<br />\nthe eventful close of this week is<br />\nbeing awaited with a large degree<br />\nof interest by all who are connected<br />\nwith the University.<br />\nNearly all of the invitations issued by those in charge of the exercises have been answered, and the<br />\npresence of a large number of<br />\nprominent men from all parts of the<br />\ncountry is assured. The Committee on Arrangements is confident<br />\nthat the program that lias been prepared will be most successfully carried out in every detail.<br />\nIt is sincerely hoped that the students of the University, and especially the undergraduates, as they<br />\nalone will be dismissed from their<br />\nregular classes, will manifest their<br />\ninterest in the exercises by volunteering as ushers on Thursday and<br />\nFriday. The ushers will be expected to wear white trousers, a black<br />\nOr blue coat, windsor tie, and black<br />\nshoes. No special arrangements<br />\nwill be made for the accommodation of the students who do not<br />\nvolunteer to act in this official capacity, and they will thus be compelled to find seats in the section of<br />\nThe stand that has been reserved for<br />\nthe general public. The services of<br />\na large number will, however, be<br />\nrequired to assist in the carrying<br />\nout of the program of the first two<br />\ndays, and Allen F. Voshell, of the<br />\nSenior Class, who is in charge of<br />\nthe arrangements that are being<br />\nmade for student participation in<br />\nthe exercises, will be glad to receive the names of any volunteers.<br />\nDr. Ralph Van D. Magoffin,<br />\nsecretary of the Committee on Arrangements, has expressed the desire that as many students as possible shall wear the thoroughly appropriate and seasonal uniform that<br />\nhas been prescribed for the ushers.<br />\nSuch a concerted action would undoubtedly add greatly to the dignity and the official character of the<br />\noccasion, and would be a thoroughly fitting manifestation of the<br />\ngeneral interest that is being taken<br />\nill the affair. The fact that two<br />\nhundred wands, \u2022 decorated with<br />\nblack and blue ribbons, are being<br />\nprepared for the ushers to use as<br />\nsigns of office, and to retain, if they<br />\nso desire, as souvenirs, is a sufficient<br />\nindication that the hearty co-operation of undergraduates is earnestly desired by those in charge of the<br />\nexercises, and that every student of<br />\nthe. University is expected to take<br />\nsome part in the program which<br />\nthey have prepared.<br /><br />\nConnolly, Hall and Straus to Go to the<br />\nNorthern Intercollegiates.<br /><br />\nIn the election held by the track<br />\nteam immediately after the meet<br />\nlast Saturday, Fred. Hall, '17, was<br />\nunanimously elected captain for<br />\nnext year. Hall has made a good<br />\nrecord this year, running as anchorman on the relay team, and winning<br />\nfirst place in the indoor South Atlantic Championship 88o-yard run.<br />\nand second place in the outdoor<br />\nevent. He had some experience at<br />\nthe game before coming to Hopkins, as point-winner on the track<br />\nteam of the Tonle School. He has<br />\ntwo more years at Hopkins and is<br />\nshowing steady improvement.<br />\nIt was announced Saturday that<br />\nConnolly, Hall and Straus will be<br />\nthe men from the team to go this<br />\nyear to the Northern Intercollegiate Championships, which will be<br />\nheld at Franklin Field, Philadelphia, May 28 and 29. Hopkins is<br />\nthe only member of the Southern<br />\nassociation to belong to the Northern division, and each year she<br />\nsends the three men required to<br />\nhold membership.<br />\nLast year<br />\n\"Freddy\" Lee, in the beautiful<br />\nworld-record making two-mile race,<br />\nplaced and secured a point for Hopkins after leading the race for seven<br />\nand a-half laps. It was hoped that<br />\nBen Tappan would be able to go this<br />\nyear, but he will have to remain in<br />\ntown at \u2022 the time, on account of<br />\nfinal examinations at the Medical<br />\nSchool.<br />\nHullabaloo Nearly Ready.<br /><br />\nThe 1915 Hullabaloo Board announces that most of the proof<br />\nreading of the book has been done,<br />\nand that the book will probably be<br />\ndistributed about the twentieth of<br />\nthis month. Business Manager<br />\nSpencer announced last week that<br />\nthose who want a copy of the book<br />\nmust order it at once if they have<br />\nnot already done so. The number<br />\nof books to be printed is to be absolutely limited.<br />\nA very noticeable feature of this<br />\nyear's Hullabaloo is the use of a<br />\nnew style of type. This makes the<br />\nbook distinctly different from those<br />\nof former years.
