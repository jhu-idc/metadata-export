Among<br />\nthem at the meeting were included a number of \"fraternity freshmen\", who by now may have formed the<br />\nimpression that such a demonstration as that put on<br />\nby their seniors is justifiable and even enjoyable. We<br />\ntake this occasion to enlighten them that such practices<br />\nare not in keeping with the tradition and spirit of the<br />\nHopkins and that it is about time they begin to<br />\ndevelop their own thinking faculties.<br />\nApparently\u2014indeed, all too apparently\u2014these<br />\nabove-mentioned groups respect no one whose freedom from prejudice and consequent clearer vision<br />\npermit him to behave like a gentleman. The pleas of<br />\nNorman Heaney and Edward Sadtler for order and<br />\nfair play seemed to carry no weight whatsoever. Yet<br />\nthey are the two men on the entire campus who should<br />\nhave the greatest influence on student opinion. The<br />\ndisregarding of all courtesy due instructors was amply<br />\nand forcefully illustrated by the disgraceful treatment<br />\naccorded Dr. Frederic C. Lane, whose remarks, by<br />\nthe way, were so harmless and devoid of propaganda<br />\nas not to be out of place at a conference on preparedness. It wasn't what the speaker said that mattered<br />\nto the crowd; he was \u00a7ufficiently and irrevocably<br />\ndamned simply because he dared to say anything!<br />\nThis, in a country where all loyal citizens take just<br />\npride in free speech, and at a University where \"Veritas vos liberabit\" is the keynote of its very existence<br />\nand mission! The entire situation seems to abound<br />\nin just such paradoxes.<br />\no-O-o<br />\nThere has been an attempt on the part of many to<br />\njustify their actions by pointing out that like outbreaks occurred in every college and university in<br />\nthe East where such student anti-war strikes were<br />\nheld. Therefore, they triumphantly conclude, Hopkins students have merely proved themselves human<br />\nand similar to those of other institutions. Precisely,<br />\n.and therein lies the absurdity of such reasoning.<br />\nPresident Ames himself has repeatedly stressed the<br />\nfact that the Hopkins owes its supremacy in the fields<br />\nof education and research to its policy of not modeling<br />\nitself upon other universities. It has attained its<br />\npresent high place in the academic sun by unceasingly pursuing those principles which it considers worthy<br />\nand beneficial, irrespective of their acceptance by others. Thus, here was a golden opportunity for the<br />\nHopkins undergraduate to establish his intelligence<br />\nand refinement by contrast\u2014and he failed miserably.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued From Page 1, Col. 3)<br />\na universal campus figure has been exploded, temporarily at least. He still exists, yes, but is now the<br />\nexception rather than the rule ; he is the last representative of a rapidly dying species. And he has been<br />\ndispossessed by a raucous, callow, infantile type to<br />\nwhom such words as propriety, decency, courtesy,<br />\nand sportsmanship are mere nothings as compared<br />\nto \"the thrill of a good old egg fight,\" as one of the<br />\nbreed so naively put it.<br />\nIt serves as a challenge to the Administration that<br />\nit can no longer sit back smugly and place implicit<br />\nconfidence in the Hopkins undergraduate's ability to<br />\nconduct himself like a gentleman. If this now altogether ridiculous and fictitious legend is to become a<br />\nreality once more, the Administration will find itself<br />\ncompelled to awake from its lethargy and effect a<br />\nthorough housecleaning, at the same time providing<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthat no more dirt sneak in.<br />\nFor what possible excuse can be found to warrant<br />\nthe conduct of the vast majority of the student body<br />\nlast Friday morning? Here was a small group of<br />\ntheir classmates seeking in a decent manner to espouse and propagate a cause which is certainly cherished by every intelligent person throughout the<br />\nworld. They had purposely called their meeting during class hours because it was the only means at their<br />\ncommand whereby they could sufficiently emphasize<br />\ntheir movement and attract popular interest. No uniforms were theirs, no established course, no instrument with which they could forcibly gain the attention of the University. Spectacular methods such as<br />\nthey employed were the sole effective weapons which<br />\nthey possessed. And yet they did not abuse these<br />\nweapons, as the distinctly non-inflammatory content<br />\nof their speeches clearly attested to all those within<br />\nearshot.<br />\no-O-o<br />\nAs was probably to be expected, members of the<br />\nR. 0. T. C. led the bombardment of eggs, tomatoes,<br />\nand grapefruit, as well as concocting the shallowminded plan of making use of the fire hose. Here<br />\nthey were, wearing the uniform of a country which<br />\nprides itself upon the common privilege of freedom<br />\nof speech, attempting to deprive others of this privilege of freedom of speech. Thoughtless fellows, they<br />\ncertainly reacted to the situation in the worst possible<br />\nmanner. They could have so easily turned the tide in<br />\ntheir own favor had one of them accepted the strikers'<br />\ninvitation to speak on behalf of preparedness and the<br />\nR. 0. T. C. He would have received the enthusiastic<br />\nbacking and applause of his overwhelmingly large<br />\nnumber of colleagues to support his assertions. And<br />\nif this ran contrary to the R. 0. T. C. policy, the<br />\ngroup could have manifested their disdain either by<br />\nstaying away from the meeting altogether, or, if they<br />\ndesired to attend, by departing entirely unimpressed<br />\nafter the speeches were concluded.

Among<br />\nthem at the meeting were included a number of \"fraternity freshmen\", who by now may have formed the<br />\nimpression that such a demonstration as that put on<br />\nby their seniors is justifiable and even enjoyable. We<br />\ntake this occasion to enlighten them that such practices<br />\nare not in keeping with the tradition and spirit of the<br />\nHopkins and that it is about time they begin to<br />\ndevelop their own thinking faculties.<br />\nApparently\u2014indeed, all too apparently\u2014these<br />\nabove-mentioned groups respect no one whose freedom from prejudice and consequent clearer vision<br />\npermit him to behave like a gentleman. The pleas of<br />\nNorman Heaney and Edward Sadtler for order and<br />\nfair play seemed to carry no weight whatsoever. Yet<br />\nthey are the two men on the entire campus who should<br />\nhave the greatest influence on student opinion. The<br />\ndisregarding of all courtesy due instructors was amply<br />\nand forcefully illustrated by the disgraceful treatment<br />\naccorded Dr. Frederic C. Lane, whose remarks, by<br />\nthe way, were so harmless and devoid of propaganda<br />\nas not to be out of place at a conference on preparedness. It wasn't what the speaker said that mattered<br />\nto the crowd; he was \u00a7ufficiently and irrevocably<br />\ndamned simply because he dared to say anything!<br />\nThis, in a country where all loyal citizens take just<br />\npride in free speech, and at a University where \"Veritas vos liberabit\" is the keynote of its very existence<br />\nand mission!

Precisely,<br />\n.and therein lies the absurdity of such reasoning.<br />\nPresident Ames himself has repeatedly stressed the<br />\nfact that the Hopkins owes its supremacy in the fields<br />\nof education and research to its policy of not modeling<br />\nitself upon other universities. It has attained its<br />\npresent high place in the academic sun by unceasingly pursuing those principles which it considers worthy<br />\nand beneficial, irrespective of their acceptance by others.

Here was a small group of<br />\ntheir classmates seeking in a decent manner to espouse and propagate a cause which is certainly cherished by every intelligent person throughout the<br />\nworld. They had purposely called their meeting during class hours because it was the only means at their<br />\ncommand whereby they could sufficiently emphasize<br />\ntheir movement and attract popular interest. No uniforms were theirs, no established course, no instrument with which they could forcibly gain the attention of the University. Spectacular methods such as<br />\nthey employed were the sole effective weapons which<br />\nthey possessed. And yet they did not abuse these<br />\nweapons, as the distinctly non-inflammatory content<br />\nof their speeches clearly attested to all those within<br />\nearshot.<br />\no-O-o<br />\nAs was probably to be expected, members of the<br />\nR. 0.

Thoughtless fellows, they<br />\ncertainly reacted to the situation in the worst possible<br />\nmanner.
