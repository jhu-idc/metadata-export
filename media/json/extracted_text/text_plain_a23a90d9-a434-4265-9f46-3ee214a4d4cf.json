Sykes, Richard Hahn,<br />\nRober Fleischer and Leopold Michel, all of Hopkins, are, through<br />\nAttorney Eugene P. Childs, appealng for a reversal of the decision<br />\nendered in the case.<br />\nWhen the matter will be brought<br />\nbefore the City Council of Annapolis, which is the Court of Appeals in the town, has not been<br />\nlearned? but it is believed that litigaion will begin tomorrow.<br />\nWere Spectators<br />\nAccording to the four who are<br />\nappealing the case in which 18 Hopkins students were fined $6.75 each<br />\nby Police Justice Louis M. Hopkins,<br />\nhey were only spectators at the<br />\nnight street battle. They were arested, they believe, because it was<br />\nordered that a general round-up be<br />\nmade of Hopkins and St. John's<br />\ntudents.<br />\nIt is alleged by many Homewood<br />\nmen who were imprisoned as a reult of the pre-game demonstration<br />\nthat ten students were placed in a<br />\ningle cell which is said to be six<br />\neet by four in size and in which<br />\nthere was only one bunk. Requests<br />\nfor water and permission to telegraph parents, relatives, or friends<br />\nwere denied, it is said.<br />\nDr. Gordon Also Asks Appeal<br />\nThrough its president, Dr. Douglass H. Gordon, St. John's College<br />\nhas also appealed the court's decision. Mr. Child~, in demanding<br />\nan appeal, declared that the city of<br />\nAnnapolis should apologize to the<br />\nstudents rather than fine them. It<br />\nis believed that had the police and<br />\nfiremen not intervened the damage<br />\nto the $16,000 fire truck and to<br />\nmembers of the two departments<br />\nwould have been averted. Mr.<br />\nChilds claimed that Fire Marshal<br />\nJ. A. Fisher's anger led to the fight<br />\nbetween students and firemen. In<br />\nheated phraseology, Mr. Childs said<br />\nAnnapolitians should demand that<br />\ncharges be placed against the Fire<br />\nMarshal for inciting the real<br />\ntrouble.<br />\nChilds Asks Impeachment<br />\n\"I feel that Marshal Fisher should<br />\nbe impeached and dismissed from<br />\noffice,\" the attorney representing the<br />\nHopkins students was quoted as<br />\nsaying by The Evening Capital.<br />\n\"In my opinion, the Fire Marshal<br />\nlost his head and is, jointly with<br />\nMayor Walter E. Quentstedt, to<br />\nblame for the resultant skirmish<br />\nand damage to participants and<br />\nproperty.''<br />\nSt. John 's students, lined up on<br />\nthe sidewalks, advised the Hopkins<br />\ncontingent to ffcall it a night.'' The<br />\nfire hose, for no reason, it is said,<br />\nwas turned on the St. John's men<br />\nwho, angered at this act, attacked<br />\nthe firemen. This move by the<br />\nAnnapolis college students was upheld by Dr. Gordon, Mr. Childs and<br />\nothers.<br />\n----------0---<br />\n<br />\nTo Hold Convention<br />\nThe fall convention of the Intercollegiate News Association of the<br />\nMiddle Atlantic States will be held<br />\nat Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa.,<br />\non November 6 and 7.<br />\n<br />\nAthletics, R. 0.

The amount<br />\npaid for salaries constituted 65.9 per<br />\ncent of the total expenses.<br />\nAmong definite recommendations<br />\nmade were arrangements for retiring allowances for professors and<br />\nassociates under a system which has<br />\nbeen devised to go into effect next<br />\nyear, greater provision for physical exercise for students, the elimination of the present system of<br />\ncharges for admission to athletic<br />\nevents.<br />\nSuggests Faculty Athletic Control<br />\nDr. Ames suggested that all<br />\nathletics sho\"uld be controlled by<br />\nthe faculty and not by the athletic<br />\ncouncil.<br />\nIn praising the R. 0.

As explained by<br />\nthe psychologist, they are provided<br />\nas a help to the student should he<br />\nlater meet with difficulty. On the<br />\nbasis of the classification thus obtained the incoming classes are<br />\nroughly split into three divisions:<br />\nlow, average, and high.

These<br />\nwere all considered as being the<br />\ndefinite obstruations to the proper<br />\nfunctioning of justice-dispensation.<br />\nCounter-Actions Of Difficulties<br />\nIts principle study lay in the<br />\nbringing forward the following<br />\nmethods of counter-acting the difficulties: reducing the number of<br />\ncases brought before the court; and<br />\nthe early elimination of suits and<br />\ndefenses not meriting or requiring<br />\nextended treatment.<br />\nThe collection of judgments; an<br />\nanalysis of jury trials; and the<br />\nhousing and facilities for judicial<br />\nbusiness, constituted the third and<br />\nfinal division of the study.
