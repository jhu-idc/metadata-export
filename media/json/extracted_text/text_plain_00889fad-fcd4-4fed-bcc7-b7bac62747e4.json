It was in<br />\nconnection with these topographical peculiarities that I met with some adventures.<br />\nWe had started out on bicycles to go from<br />\nthe sunny town of Lugano to another Swiss<br />\ntown equally beautiful and equally Italian, to<br />\nLocarno on Lake Maggoire. The ride was delightful, and we proceeded with due enjoyment<br />\nof our surroundings, and in possession of passports and all necessary papers until we came<br />\nto the frontier hamlet of Fortessa. It was<br />\neasy to pass the Swiss custom house because<br />\nwe were going out, but it was not many moments before we realized that we were in a foreign country, for we were immediately halted<br />\nby another set of guards in uniform, who inspected our papers and looked critically upon<br />\nour persons. It never occurred to me that the<br />\nfew hours that we should be in Italy we<br />\nshould be under suspicion, but the Italian custom house wished to know where we were going. That was easily explained, but there<br />\nwere possibilities in the thing. We might turn<br />\noff at the next crossing, flee to the woods and<br />\nsell those bicycles, escaping the tax.<br />\nThere were various ways in which this matter might have been settled. We might have<br />\nbeen imprisoned and held until we were ready<br />\nto go back into Switzerland by the way we<br />\ncame, or, we might have been obliged to pay a<br />\ntariff duty about equal to the value of the machines, but the Italian government chose another way. It was delicately considerate and<br />\ncomplimentary. We were conducted across the<br />\ncountry under military escort. To be sure this<br />\nescort consisted of one soldier who had no gun<br />\nnor yet a bicycle. My better half mounted her<br />\n<br />\nNo. 11<br />\n<br />\nwheel and rode, but to allay suspicion, and to<br />\n'avoid the used of any weapons he might have<br />\nconcealed in his clothing, I walked, as far as<br />\nLuino, over two or three miles of the<br />\nmost aggravatingly smooth roads imaginable<br />\ndown through the city to the chief custom<br />\nhouse, paid an insignificant sum for the<br />\nexamination of our papers and the services<br />\nof our soldier, then passed on to the steamboat landing where we put the padlock on the<br />\nwheels and left them in charge of the guard.<br />\nPoor fellow! After all that walk he had to stay<br />\nthere two hours more, pass his supper time,<br />\nwhile we walked about, saw the town and fared<br />\nsumptuously. In fact, he followed the wheels<br />\non board the steamer, remained with us until<br />\nwe had passed an invisible frontier, and delivered us once more in the hands of the<br />\nSwiss.<br />\nI need not relate the details of the journey<br />\nwe took returning by a route entirely within<br />\nSwiss territory to Laganio. Suffice it to say<br />\nthat we soon after started southward for Como<br />\nwith the expectation of staying a few days on<br />\nthe Italian lakes and returning to Switzerland.<br />\nFor some reason I received the impression that<br />\nthe Italian custom house on that route would<br />\noffer no difficulties. I found my mistake at<br />\nChiasso. We had been coming slowly down<br />\nthe road, enjoying the landscape; and photographing the peasants, with no suspicion that<br />\nbicycles were an object of terror to Italian officials. As usual, we carried very little money<br />\non the road, and were unprepared to pay taxes<br />\nor to buy official courtesy. To my dismay the<br />\nPhilistines at Chiasso demanded ninety francs<br />\napiece for the passage of our machines. The<br />\nmost profound search revealed only half that<br />\nsum on the combined persons of the party. In<br />\nletters of credit they were not learned, and so<br />\nsmall a town could not pretend to have a bank.<br />\nThe nearest financial resource was at Como,<br />\ntwo miles away. Things looked dubious for a<br />\ntime, but at last a brilliant thought flashed<br />\nover me. I deposited my wife and one machine<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nwith the custom house, and road the other to<br />\nComo after the money. In an hour and a half<br />\nI returned withe plenty of funds to claim my<br />\ndeposits. My active pledge had in the meanwhile employed her time with usury, for her<br />\nwater color brush had been capturing a small<br />\nItalian citizen in red cap and bare feet. By<br />\nthe time the papers were made out \"Miguel\"<br />\nwas fast in her sketch-book.<br />\nIf Lake Como had not been so often described, I might relate my impressions. These<br />\nlittle difficulties with human institutions made<br />\nno difference in the beauty of the scenery, but<br />\nI would not have you think that my adventures with the custom house ceased at this<br />\npoint.<br />\nThe journey from Como to Chiavenna can<br />\nbe made by rail, but we did not propose to<br />\ntravel in that manner, neither did we intend to<br />\nmake the trip in the ordinary way by water,<br />\nbut mounted our wheels, and started up the<br />\nwestern side of the western arm of the lake.<br />\nLake Como would be better described by the<br />\nuse of the word \"leg,\" for on the map it looks<br />\nlike an overgrown horse-raddish root on the<br />\nrun, the city of Como being fastened to the<br />\n\" toe of the forward foot. We followed the<br />\nroad as far as the little town of Torriggia.<br />\nHere the highway suddenly dwindled to a<br />\nmule path, and we sat down under the trees to<br />\nrest, to photograph and sketch until the next<br />\nsteamer came by. This arrived in the course<br />\nof an hour or two and we led our horses on<br />\nboard. As we mounted the steps of the upper<br />\ndeck we suddenly became conscious of friendly<br />\nfaces. First one and then the other came forward, until there were four young men from<br />\nBaltimore before us. Not only that, but they<br />\nwere all from my department of the University,<br />\nand persons with whom I had been in daily<br />\nassociation for years. You will excuse me if<br />\nI say this word \"paralyzed\" to express our<br />\nemotions, for at Bellaggio we changed the<br />\nsteamer for a row boat and had ourselves propelled to the north side of the lake. From<br />\nthat point we went up toward the passes of the<br />\nAlps by man power, furnished by members of<br />\nthe party.<br />\nIt was up in the pass above Chiavenna that<br />\nthe closing events of this episode took place.<br />\n<br />\nWe had pushed rapidly up the hill in order to<br />\nreach the Swiss border at the proper time, and<br />\nfull of haste and brown dust, I presented my<br />\npapers, receipts and passports. The official<br />\nwas very polite. The papers were all clear<br />\nthat I had deposited money, and that I was the<br />\nperson. Very sorry, however, that he had no<br />\nauthorization to /Say out money. Papers failed<br />\nto indicate at what point the bicycles were to<br />\nbe exported. I had in fact told the people at<br />\nChiasso a dozen times over that I was going<br />\nout by the way of Chiavenna, but they had<br />\nneglected the proper formalities. It would be<br />\nnecessary to request the Italian government in<br />\nRome to permit the custom house at Villa di<br />\nChiavenna to return me the duty on two bicycles. The thing looked for a moment like robbery, but I was comforted with the assurance<br />\nthat within two weeks the same thing had happened to eleven other Americans and that they<br />\nhad come out all right.<br />\nIt was Friday, and we were in the uttermost<br />\nparts of the kingdom. A petition by letter<br />\nmeant a week or more of delay. So armed<br />\nwith a properly worded telegram I hastened<br />\nback a mile down the hill to the shoemaker<br />\nwho kept the post and telegraph office, and<br />\nturned over my affairs to the minions of electricity. In the meanwhile, we made ourselves<br />\ncomfortable on the Swiss side of the line. It<br />\nwas a village of at least seven houses, and in<br />\nthe midst of chestnut trees, and side hill farming, performed by the female population. For<br />\ntwo whole days we studied Swiss institutions,<br />\npainted the scenery and collected botanical<br />\nspecimens.<br />\nAt five o'clock Saturday evening a reply,<br />\ndated at Rome at 12 the same day reached the<br />\ncustom house at Villa di Chiavenna, and our<br />\nfinancial matters were straightened out.<br />\nI have never obtained a really satisfactory<br />\nhistory of that message. One does not like to<br />\ncriticize unduly the methods of foreign governments when there may be great natural<br />\ndifficulties to overcome. Especially is it true<br />\nin this case, where anyone can see from the<br />\nmaps that Villa di Chianna is 2500 feet above<br />\nthe sea, and the wire from Rome comes all the<br />\nway up hill.<br />\nJOHN MARTIN VINCENT.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAPELLO.<br />\nMr. Editor.<br />\nIt occured to me the other day that the great<br />\nuse of a Junior in College is to advise Freshmen: and since I am debarred in future, from<br />\ngiving Freshmen any more physical advice,<br />\nI am going to excercise my other prerogatives,<br />\nand give them some mental and moral advice<br />\nconcerning a matter which I think should be<br />\nbrought to their attention.<br />\nI wonder, to how many Freshman, has the<br />\nfact presented itself that they owe the University something more than their tuition fees?<br />\nYou applaud the leaders of your class, the<br />\nmembers of the athletic teams, and,sometimes<br />\nthe musical clubs. Do you ever try to do the<br />\nthings they do? You cannot, you say. How<br />\ndo you know you cannot? Have you tried?<br />\nIf you are musical or shine in the social world,<br />\njoin the musical clubs. If you are big and<br />\nstrong, patronize \"Mac\" and the cage. If<br />\nyou are studious, try for class honors. If you<br />\nare none of the above, but have a sneaking<br />\nfondness for Dr. Green's papers, try for the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER staff.<br />\nIt is to this last class of men that I address<br />\nthis appeal. It is your duty to help the paper,<br />\nbecause if you can write, your work is needed<br />\nin its columns. If the paper is not as good as<br />\nit might be (I am sure the editors will pardon<br />\nme) try and make it better. Criticism is good<br />\nbut work is better. How can the editors ever<br />\nimprove the NEWS-LETTER when everyone<br />\nabuses it, and no one writes for it? Don't be<br />\nlike the basement-loafers who look at their<br />\ncopies on alternate Thursday evenings, and<br />\nthen always say \"Well, it's a pretty bum<br />\nnumber. I don't see why we can't have a<br />\ngood paper here.\" I asked one of these gentlemen one day if he had even done anything<br />\nto make it better, and he said \"Oh, I sent in a<br />\npiece once, but they would'nt take it.\" I<br />\ndiscovered afterward that the piece in question<br />\nwas something on the order of Baccaccio's<br />\nfamous tales\u2014naughty but very nice.<br />\nNow, boys, that is not the way to support<br />\nyour college paper. The NEWS-LETTER represents the literary ability of the Hopkins undergraduate body. To the world at large we are<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nknown by this paper. If we think it is poor,<br />\nwe should make it better. If you think you<br />\ncan write, try for the staff. If you don't make<br />\nit, write for the paper anyhow. If you have<br />\n,no literary ability, don't attempt to criticise<br />\nthose who have. I know you are going to say<br />\n\"Yes, that's true\" and then do nothing. I did<br />\nthe same thing. I am sorry now, and I am<br />\ndoing penance by trying to keep you from my<br />\nerror. There are places on the staff, fill them.<br />\nShow the rest of the world that the Hopkins<br />\nmen are not all ignorant, and,show the rest of<br />\nthe Hopkins men that the class of 1903 is alive to<br />\nits responsibilities. Don't wait 'till next year.<br />\nIt will be too late then. Try now, and then<br />\nnext year you will thank him who now gives<br />\nyou this advice.<br />\n<br />\nA JUNIOR.<br />\nGLORY BE UNTO HIM!<br />\n(Mr. W B.

The \"NEWS-LETTER\" joins with the<br />\nstudent body in expressing its regret at the<br />\nloss from active leadership of one who has<br />\nbeen so conspicuous in athletic circles during<br />\nthe past three years.<br />\nWith the exception of Director Mackdermott, no one connected with the University is<br />\nmore thoroughly alive to our athletic interests,<br />\nnor more completely conversant with every<br />\nbranch of Hopkins sport than Mr. Maddren ;<br />\nwhile together with these qualities he combines<br />\nexecutive ability, and the faculty for imparting enthusiasm among the student ranks.<br />\nWhile Mr. Maddren has retired from his official position, we hope that we may still have<br />\nthe benefit of his advice in athletic matters.<br />\nIn choosing his successor we consider that<br />\nthe Board has exercised great discernment.<br />\nMr. Reese is one who has the athletic interests<br />\nof the University at heart, and anything he<br />\nundertakes is certain of a successful termination. Besides this he may rely upon the cooperation of the students.<br />\nor w<br />\nThe successes of the Track and Field Team<br />\nin the recent indoor meets in this city and<br />\nWashington show plainly that despite our<br />\nheavy losses of last year Hopkins still has a<br />\nteam which comes up to the high standard set<br />\n<br />\nby the champions of 190o. Some of the best<br />\nmen in the dashes and runs left the University,<br />\nbut those remaining form a nucleus on which<br />\nat the beginning of this year Director Mackdermott started to build. The material in the<br />\nFreshman class was good, and under hard<br />\ntraining soon developed some excellent men in<br />\nthe dashes, so that the first meet brought many<br />\nprizes to the trophy-room. The team has been<br />\nshowing up stronger at every succeeding meet,<br />\nand deserves the heartiest congratulations of<br />\nall Hopkins men for its zealous efforts. Though<br />\nit is composed of men from all branches of the<br />\nUniversity, there are enough younger men on<br />\nthe team to assure a firm foundation for next<br />\nyear.<br />\nor w<br />\nIn our last issue we called attention to the<br />\nduty now confronting us regarding the necessary improvements to be added to American<br />\nLeague Park, for the benefit of Hopkins Athletes. No matter what bright joys the future<br />\nholds in store for us, in the shape of expensive<br />\nathletic fields and green campuses, our present<br />\nneeds are pressing. The musical :clubs have<br />\ngenerously enlisted themselves in the service<br />\nof raising the finances needed for this purpose,<br />\nand will shortly give a concert for tha benefit<br />\nof the athletic fund. It is gratifying to see<br />\nhow the students have responded to the subscription call, and, judging from results thus<br />\nobtained, we predict that they can be counted<br />\nupon to turn out in a body the evening of the<br />\nconcert. Despite our lack of students, our<br />\nathletic victories during the last few years<br />\nhave placed Hopkins upon a higher footing in<br />\nthe athletic world, and this fact together with<br />\nbright prospects for the future should stimulate<br />\nus all to greater activity.<br />\nw<br />\nor<br />\nHE readers of this issue should mark well<br />\nand inwardly digest a communication in<br />\nthese columns headed \"Apello,\" and signed<br />\n\"A Junior\". The moral of the epistle is<br />\npointed at the members of the Class of 1903,<br />\nbut there is no reason why the rest of the<br />\nUniversity should not profit by the excellent<br />\nadvice contained therein. It is broad enough<br />\nto embrace all classes, but, doubtless the reason<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nfor especially admonishing the Freshmen is<br />\nbecause it is usually considered that their juvenile buoyancy is still in the effervescent<br />\nstage, and that their characters have not yet<br />\nbeen moulded into permanent form. In<br />\nby-gone days the \"NEWS\u2014LETTER\" has harped<br />\nupon the theme of a man's duty to his college;<br />\nin days to come it will doubtless continue to sing<br />\nthis lay, but a letter like \"Apello\" coming as<br />\nit does from one not officially connected with<br />\nthis paper, carries with it more weight than<br />\nanything we may say upon the subject. Besides it is an encouraging sign, for it shows<br />\nthat the work of \"by gone days\" is finally<br />\nbearing fruit.<br />\niv or er<br />\nA gratifying recognition of the worth of the<br />\nUniversity has just been witnessed.<br />\nThe German American citizens of Baltimore<br />\npropose to contribute $100,000 towards the<br />\nendowment fund of a million now being raised.<br />\nThis contribution is to establish a chair of<br />\nGerman language and literature.<br />\nIt is reported that $20,000 of the amount<br />\nhas already been raised by fifteen gentlemen<br />\nwho are members of the Germania Club. We<br />\ntake pleasure in voicing the sentiment of gratitude which every Hopkins man must feel towards these liberal-minded gentlemen. Such<br />\ngenerosity should, and doubtless will,serve as<br />\nan object lesson to other beneficently inclined<br />\ncitizens of Baltimore.<br />\nor oir 9r<br />\nTHE HOPKINS CLUB.<br />\nIT is reported that the Johns Hopkins Club<br />\nmay soon move to other quarters. The growing attractiveness and interest would seem to<br />\ndemand a site more easily reached by the<br />\nmembers. The Club boasts of an excellent<br />\nkitchen and buffet, which may be enjoyed at<br />\nvery moderate rates; but the members do not<br />\nlunch or spend their evenings at the club as<br />\nmuch as they might, were the position nearer<br />\nthe University, or on their way from places<br />\nof amusement. Great atttactions too are<br />\noffered to members who wish to occupy rooms<br />\nin the club house. It is felt that this and the<br />\nother good features of the Club will be enhanced by a more central location.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nTHE FRESHMAN BANQUET.<br />\nFreshman banquet, marking as it does<br />\nTHE<br />\nthe cessation of friendly clashes between<br />\nnaughty two and naughty three, was a howling<br />\nSuccess from several standpoints. Almost every<br />\nmember of the clsss attended, the apt speeches<br />\nwere well delivered, and the presence of two<br />\nJuniors during the festivities added a certain<br />\nfascination to the pleasure, and without doubt,<br />\nmade the affair the most unique in the annals<br />\nof similar feeds. The class of 1903 is the first<br />\nto enjoy the distinction of having entertained<br />\nsuch unheard of guests at its Freshmen banquet; and it is greatly to the credit of naughty<br />\nthree that at no time during the evening was<br />\na spirit of animosity exhibited. Songs were<br />\nsung, toasts were responded to, and frequent<br />\nknocks made at the Juniors, but at no time<br />\nwere any attempts made to belittle or discomfort the unexpected guests. Before the last<br />\ncourse had been served the aforementioned<br />\ngentlemen were invited to partake of Freshman<br />\nhospitality. They accordingiy drew up, and<br />\nthe mellowing influences of the spread soon<br />\nhad their effects. Both guests made very appropriate speeches, and assured their entertainers that, with the exception of 1902, naughtythree is the best class that ever entered Hopkins. They ended by expressing sincere apapreciation for the hospitality accorded them.<br />\nAs a toastmaster, Harry K. Tootle proved<br />\nto be the real thing. He was full of catchy<br />\njokes, and always had some bright remark<br />\nto continue the merriment. His address in<br />\nwhich he referred to \"taking the Law into<br />\nour hands\" was greeted with deafening applause. The toast \"Our Newly-Acquired<br />\nPossessions\" was construed by some to refer<br />\nto the Juniors present, instead of Homewood.<br />\nAccordingly, some very good puns were gotten<br />\noff by impromptu speakers. The jolly time<br />\nended with numerous class yells and songs,<br />\ninterspersed with several rousing \"Hullabaloos.\" The menu cards were bound in the<br />\nUniversity colors with \"class '03, J. H. U.\"<br />\nengraved in olive and white on the cover page.<br />\nMessrs. Robinson C. Pagon, Benjamin Weeks,<br />\nR. Curzon Hoffman, Wethered L.

Sellman Bird composed the arrangement<br />\ncommittee. The toasts and those who responded are as follows: \"Our Class,\" by W.<br />\nS. Bird; \"The Freshman in Athletics,\" by A.<br />\nB. Atkinson; \"Our Enemies\u2014the Juniors,\"<br />\nby J. B. G. Custis, Jr. ; \"The Loyalty of<br />\n1903,\" by H. W. Plaggemeyer; \"Next Year,\"<br />\nby H. T.

Alan Haughton,<br />\nwho was to respond to the toast \"The Ladies.\"<br />\n.As .As<br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\nJohns Hopkins Glee, Banjo and ManHE<br />\ndolin Clubs gave an informal concert at<br />\nthe University Club on the evening of Friday,<br />\nMarch Eighth. This is the first time that the<br />\nClubs have appeared before the public in the<br />\nguise of a paid orchestra, and the result was<br />\nnot altogether successful. The audience did<br />\nnot deem it necessary to stop talking during<br />\nthe songs and other pieces, consequently it<br />\nwas hard for the men to play and sing, and<br />\nstill harder for those who were appreciative to<br />\nhear the music. Altogether the evening was<br />\nnot enjoyable or successful, and it is to be<br />\nhoped that no more such concerts will be<br />\nscheduled.<br />\nAfter a few attempts by the various Clubs<br />\nto make themselves heard, the men gave up,<br />\nand mingled with the crowd in its rush for<br />\nrefreshments. Then the pleasanter part of the<br />\nevening began, for there were a number of<br />\nattractive girls and women present, and several<br />\nJohns Hopkins Professors and Alumni very<br />\nthoughtfully looked after the welfare of the<br />\nmen.<br />\nManager Bird has nearly completed his<br />\narrangements for the Easter trip, and from<br />\npresent prospects it will be as thoroughly successful as the one last year. So far the plans<br />\nare to leave Baltimore Friday afternoon ou one<br />\nof the Bay Line Steamers and give the first<br />\nconcert at Old Point Comfort on Saturday<br />\nnight. This is the very best night in the<br />\n<br />\nwhole year to attract an audience, and it was<br />\nonly through the energy and perseverance of<br />\nthe manager that this date was obtained. Last<br />\nyear the Clubs had to play second best, and<br />\ngive their concert on Good-Friday when there<br />\nwere necessarily fewer people present. But<br />\nthis year Princeton will have to take our last<br />\nyear's place while the Hopkins Clubs have the<br />\nbest night.<br />\nFrom Old Point Comfort the men will go to<br />\nRichmond and give a concert there on the following Monday\u2014These places are the only<br />\nones that are definitely decided upon, but it is<br />\nlikely that several other cities will be visited<br />\nbefore the Clubs return. There is even a rumor that Atlantic City will be \"taken in,\"<br />\nbut this is a little doubtful.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nTHE SECOND BALTIMORE CONCERT.<br />\nmost important concert in the history<br />\nTHE<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins Musical Clubs will<br />\nbe given in McCoy Hall on Tuesday evening,<br />\nMarch 26. Its great importance lies in the<br />\nfact that the proceeds will be used to help pay<br />\nfor the erection of the club house and gymnasium on the new athletic grounds.<br />\nThe alumni of the University have been doing their utmost to raise the necessary million<br />\ndollar endowment fund, and it would surely<br />\nseem rather ungrateful in the undergraduates<br />\nif they do not heartily support this concert,<br />\nand thus take away the additional responsibility of paying for the club house.<br />\nFrom the manner in which the subscription<br />\nlists have been received, however, it is unlikely that the former Hopkins men will have any<br />\nreason to believe that they are the only ones<br />\ninterested in the welfare of their Alma Mater.<br />\nWWW<br />\n<br />\nFor the handsome young dudes in far Luzon,<br />\nIt's style to keep just what they choose on.<br />\nWhy, in summer it's meet<br />\nTo appear in the street<br />\nWith just hat, collar, necktie, and shoes on.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n\"BILLY\" MADDREN RESIGNS.<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS GAMES.<br />\n<br />\nAT a meeting of the Athletic Board, held<br />\nTuesday evening, March 12th, President<br />\n\"Billy\" Maddren handed in the 'following<br />\nletter of resignation:<br />\n<br />\nCarnival of Sports under the auspices<br />\nTHE<br />\nof the Athletic Association of the Johns<br />\n<br />\nTo the Board of Directors of the 7ohns Hopkins<br />\nAthletic Association:<br />\nGENTLEMEN,\u2014It is with great regret that I<br />\nam obliged to tender my resignation as President of the Johns Hopkins Athletic Association. My reasons are that I am unable to<br />\ngive sufficient time to athletic affairs because<br />\nof my studies. This resignation is to take<br />\neffect upon the election of my successor, and<br />\nnot later than March i5th. Yours truly,<br />\nWILLIAM HARVEY MADDREN.<br />\nEvery effort was used by the Board to dissuade Mr. Maddren from his course, but he<br />\nexplained that it would be impossible for him<br />\nto devote sufficient time to the duties of presidency, as his studies at the Medical school for<br />\nthe remainder of the year would require hard<br />\nwork and close confinement. With great<br />\nreluctancy the board accepted the resignation,<br />\nand appointed a committee, with Dr. Renouf<br />\nas chairman, to draw up an appropriate resolution in appreciation of Mr. Maddren's work<br />\nin behalf of Hopkins Athletics. It is safe to<br />\nsay, that during the past three years .no other<br />\nstudent of the University has instilled as much<br />\nlife into athletics at Hopkins, as has \"Billy<br />\nMaddren.\" His most conspicuous work has<br />\nbeen in Lacrosse, and it is largely owing to his<br />\nefforts that three championship banners, 1898,<br />\n1899, 1900, now adorn the walls of the trophy<br />\nroom but besides this his advice in athletic<br />\nmatters has been of the greatest benefit, and all<br />\nregret his retirement from active athletics.<br />\nMr. Albert Reese was unanimously elected<br />\nby the Board to fill the position of president.<br />\nMr, Reese is one of the few alumni who has<br />\nnot allowed his interest in J. H. U. sports to<br />\nstop when he received his degree, but has, on<br />\nthe other hand, worked faithfully to advance<br />\nthem. This interest in athletics and his executive ability make him the most suitable man<br />\nwho could have been chosen for the position.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins University was held on last Saturday night at the Fifth Regiment Armory.<br />\nAthletes from diverse parts of the city and<br />\nstate were entertained by the University men,<br />\nwho gave them a good run for their money.<br />\nThese are the first indoor games that the<br />\nUniversity has given for some years past, and<br />\nthat they were a success is the verdict of everyone. Surely there were some hitches, but, for<br />\nthe most part, the events were run off in good<br />\ntime by the clerk of the course, Wm. M.<br />\nMackdermott, to whom all credit is due for the<br />\nsuccess of the meet.<br />\nThe hall had been very attractively decorated, and when the call was sounded for the<br />\nfirst event at 8.10, the seats lining the walls<br />\naround the floor space of the Armory were<br />\ncomfortably filled with fair enthusiasts who<br />\nhad come out in goodly numbers to cheer their<br />\nespecial favorites on to victory, while the gallery was filled with \"rooters\" of the various<br />\norganizations who had occupied themselves<br />\nwith shouting encouragement to their teams.<br />\nA large share of the honors came to the<br />\nwearers of the Black and Blue, but the representatives of Marston's University School and<br />\nthe Boys' Latin School also came in for a<br />\ngoodly share of the prizes.<br />\nThere was a slight delay in the starting of<br />\nthe game owing to the late arrival of several<br />\nof the officials; but when the games were once<br />\nstarted they went ahead at a pleasing pace. The<br />\nprogram was a very attractive one, being much<br />\nless unwieldy than the ordinary program of<br />\nBaltimore meets. Foot races were the predominant features, while there were only three<br />\nfield events.<br />\nThe first event\u2014the interscholastic 40 yard<br />\ndash\u2014was easily won by G. C. Gantz, of the<br />\nBoys' Latin School, with Bayless and Cloud<br />\nclose on him for second and third honors.<br />\nE. L. Pessagno ran a beautiful race in the<br />\n40 yard open handicap, winning first place, but<br />\nwas closely pressed by Tootle, who won the<br />\n40 yard dash in the Baltimore Athletic games<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\nof several weeks ago. Perhaps the races which<br />\ninterested the majority of the spectators were<br />\nthe twelve relay races. In the first, Marston's<br />\neasily defeated the Emerson Institute team, of<br />\nWashington. The Boys' Latin School team<br />\nalso ran a pretty race against Deichmann's.<br />\nThe special invitation relay race between St.<br />\nJohn's College and Johns Hopkins University<br />\nwas one of the prettiest of the evening. The<br />\nfirst two contestants, Whitman and Garey, ran<br />\nalmost a dead heat till the last lap, when Whitman passed his rival and finished a few yards<br />\nahead of him. Unfortunately for St. John's,<br />\nWells was not able to hold his ground on the<br />\nnext lap, and when Riggs took up the work<br />\nwhere England and Hoffman had left off,<br />\nHopkins had a lead of half a lap, and Riggs<br />\nwas able to hold his lead without exertion.<br />\nMullen, who ran under the auspices of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Club, was the only scratch man<br />\nin the mile run. He pushed ahead of all his<br />\nopponents, and caught up with Heiner, who<br />\nwas leading. On the last lap Mullens purted,<br />\nand easily won by io yards.<br />\nIn the 440 yard dash, Riggs ran a beautiful<br />\nrace. On each lap he gradually pushed up<br />\npast his opponents, and won handily on the last<br />\nlap by a beautiful spurt. All the other events,<br />\ntoo, were of equal interest, but perhaps the<br />\nmost amusing of the whole evening was the<br />\npotato race, won by C. F. Edwards. Garret<br />\nwon first in the 16-lb. shot, and second in the<br />\nhigh jump.

Such a movement will undoubtedly<br />\nmeet with serious opposition, on account of the<br />\ndeplorable manner in which last year's team<br />\nwas managed, and its untimely end. Yet, if<br />\nthe supporters of this new movement show<br />\nenough earnestness to warrant it, and will<br />\nguarantee a team which will practice, and stand<br />\nby the University during the entire season,<br />\nthere can be no doubt but that the Athletic<br />\nAssociation will give such a team its hearty<br />\nsupport.<br />\nSeveral challenges have been received from<br />\nprominent colleges and associations, and it<br />\nseems rather sad, that we energetic Hopkinsonions who are making such rapid strides in<br />\nother lines of athletic sport, cannot organize<br />\nand support a base-ball team.

It was in<br />\nconnection with these topographical peculiarities that I met with some adventures.<br />\nWe had started out on bicycles to go from<br />\nthe sunny town of Lugano to another Swiss<br />\ntown equally beautiful and equally Italian, to<br />\nLocarno on Lake Maggoire. The ride was delightful, and we proceeded with due enjoyment<br />\nof our surroundings, and in possession of passports and all necessary papers until we came<br />\nto the frontier hamlet of Fortessa. It was<br />\neasy to pass the Swiss custom house because<br />\nwe were going out, but it was not many moments before we realized that we were in a foreign country, for we were immediately halted<br />\nby another set of guards in uniform, who inspected our papers and looked critically upon<br />\nour persons. It never occurred to me that the<br />\nfew hours that we should be in Italy we<br />\nshould be under suspicion, but the Italian custom house wished to know where we were going. That was easily explained, but there<br />\nwere possibilities in the thing. We might turn<br />\noff at the next crossing, flee to the woods and<br />\nsell those bicycles, escaping the tax.<br />\nThere were various ways in which this matter might have been settled. We might have<br />\nbeen imprisoned and held until we were ready<br />\nto go back into Switzerland by the way we<br />\ncame, or, we might have been obliged to pay a<br />\ntariff duty about equal to the value of the machines, but the Italian government chose another way. It was delicately considerate and<br />\ncomplimentary. We were conducted across the<br />\ncountry under military escort. To be sure this<br />\nescort consisted of one soldier who had no gun<br />\nnor yet a bicycle. My better half mounted her<br /><br />\nNo. 11<br /><br />\nwheel and rode, but to allay suspicion, and to<br />\n'avoid the used of any weapons he might have<br />\nconcealed in his clothing, I walked, as far as<br />\nLuino, over two or three miles of the<br />\nmost aggravatingly smooth roads imaginable<br />\ndown through the city to the chief custom<br />\nhouse, paid an insignificant sum for the<br />\nexamination of our papers and the services<br />\nof our soldier, then passed on to the steamboat landing where we put the padlock on the<br />\nwheels and left them in charge of the guard.<br />\nPoor fellow! After all that walk he had to stay<br />\nthere two hours more, pass his supper time,<br />\nwhile we walked about, saw the town and fared<br />\nsumptuously. In fact, he followed the wheels<br />\non board the steamer, remained with us until<br />\nwe had passed an invisible frontier, and delivered us once more in the hands of the<br />\nSwiss.<br />\nI need not relate the details of the journey<br />\nwe took returning by a route entirely within<br />\nSwiss territory to Laganio. Suffice it to say<br />\nthat we soon after started southward for Como<br />\nwith the expectation of staying a few days on<br />\nthe Italian lakes and returning to Switzerland.<br />\nFor some reason I received the impression that<br />\nthe Italian custom house on that route would<br />\noffer no difficulties. I found my mistake at<br />\nChiasso. We had been coming slowly down<br />\nthe road, enjoying the landscape; and photographing the peasants, with no suspicion that<br />\nbicycles were an object of terror to Italian officials. As usual, we carried very little money<br />\non the road, and were unprepared to pay taxes<br />\nor to buy official courtesy. To my dismay the<br />\nPhilistines at Chiasso demanded ninety francs<br />\napiece for the passage of our machines. The<br />\nmost profound search revealed only half that<br />\nsum on the combined persons of the party. In<br />\nletters of credit they were not learned, and so<br />\nsmall a town could not pretend to have a bank.<br />\nThe nearest financial resource was at Como,<br />\ntwo miles away. Things looked dubious for a<br />\ntime, but at last a brilliant thought flashed<br />\nover me. I deposited my wife and one machine<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nwith the custom house, and road the other to<br />\nComo after the money. In an hour and a half<br />\nI returned withe plenty of funds to claim my<br />\ndeposits. My active pledge had in the meanwhile employed her time with usury, for her<br />\nwater color brush had been capturing a small<br />\nItalian citizen in red cap and bare feet. By<br />\nthe time the papers were made out \"Miguel\"<br />\nwas fast in her sketch-book.<br />\nIf Lake Como had not been so often described, I might relate my impressions. These<br />\nlittle difficulties with human institutions made<br />\nno difference in the beauty of the scenery, but<br />\nI would not have you think that my adventures with the custom house ceased at this<br />\npoint.<br />\nThe journey from Como to Chiavenna can<br />\nbe made by rail, but we did not propose to<br />\ntravel in that manner, neither did we intend to<br />\nmake the trip in the ordinary way by water,<br />\nbut mounted our wheels, and started up the<br />\nwestern side of the western arm of the lake.<br />\nLake Como would be better described by the<br />\nuse of the word \"leg,\" for on the map it looks<br />\nlike an overgrown horse-raddish root on the<br />\nrun, the city of Como being fastened to the<br />\n\" toe of the forward foot. We followed the<br />\nroad as far as the little town of Torriggia.<br />\nHere the highway suddenly dwindled to a<br />\nmule path, and we sat down under the trees to<br />\nrest, to photograph and sketch until the next<br />\nsteamer came by. This arrived in the course<br />\nof an hour or two and we led our horses on<br />\nboard. As we mounted the steps of the upper<br />\ndeck we suddenly became conscious of friendly<br />\nfaces. First one and then the other came forward, until there were four young men from<br />\nBaltimore before us. Not only that, but they<br />\nwere all from my department of the University,<br />\nand persons with whom I had been in daily<br />\nassociation for years. You will excuse me if<br />\nI say this word \"paralyzed\" to express our<br />\nemotions, for at Bellaggio we changed the<br />\nsteamer for a row boat and had ourselves propelled to the north side of the lake. From<br />\nthat point we went up toward the passes of the<br />\nAlps by man power, furnished by members of<br />\nthe party.<br />\nIt was up in the pass above Chiavenna that<br />\nthe closing events of this episode took place.<br /><br />\nWe had pushed rapidly up the hill in order to<br />\nreach the Swiss border at the proper time, and<br />\nfull of haste and brown dust, I presented my<br />\npapers, receipts and passports. The official<br />\nwas very polite. The papers were all clear<br />\nthat I had deposited money, and that I was the<br />\nperson. Very sorry, however, that he had no<br />\nauthorization to /Say out money. Papers failed<br />\nto indicate at what point the bicycles were to<br />\nbe exported. I had in fact told the people at<br />\nChiasso a dozen times over that I was going<br />\nout by the way of Chiavenna, but they had<br />\nneglected the proper formalities. It would be<br />\nnecessary to request the Italian government in<br />\nRome to permit the custom house at Villa di<br />\nChiavenna to return me the duty on two bicycles. The thing looked for a moment like robbery, but I was comforted with the assurance<br />\nthat within two weeks the same thing had happened to eleven other Americans and that they<br />\nhad come out all right.<br />\nIt was Friday, and we were in the uttermost<br />\nparts of the kingdom. A petition by letter<br />\nmeant a week or more of delay. So armed<br />\nwith a properly worded telegram I hastened<br />\nback a mile down the hill to the shoemaker<br />\nwho kept the post and telegraph office, and<br />\nturned over my affairs to the minions of electricity. In the meanwhile, we made ourselves<br />\ncomfortable on the Swiss side of the line. It<br />\nwas a village of at least seven houses, and in<br />\nthe midst of chestnut trees, and side hill farming, performed by the female population. For<br />\ntwo whole days we studied Swiss institutions,<br />\npainted the scenery and collected botanical<br />\nspecimens.<br />\nAt five o'clock Saturday evening a reply,<br />\ndated at Rome at 12 the same day reached the<br />\ncustom house at Villa di Chiavenna, and our<br />\nfinancial matters were straightened out.<br />\nI have never obtained a really satisfactory<br />\nhistory of that message. One does not like to<br />\ncriticize unduly the methods of foreign governments when there may be great natural<br />\ndifficulties to overcome. Especially is it true<br />\nin this case, where anyone can see from the<br />\nmaps that Villa di Chianna is 2500 feet above<br />\nthe sea, and the wire from Rome comes all the<br />\nway up hill.<br />\nJOHN MARTIN VINCENT.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAPELLO.<br />\nMr. Editor.<br />\nIt occured to me the other day that the great<br />\nuse of a Junior in College is to advise Freshmen: and since I am debarred in future, from<br />\ngiving Freshmen any more physical advice,<br />\nI am going to excercise my other prerogatives,<br />\nand give them some mental and moral advice<br />\nconcerning a matter which I think should be<br />\nbrought to their attention.<br />\nI wonder, to how many Freshman, has the<br />\nfact presented itself that they owe the University something more than their tuition fees?<br />\nYou applaud the leaders of your class, the<br />\nmembers of the athletic teams, and,sometimes<br />\nthe musical clubs. Do you ever try to do the<br />\nthings they do? You cannot, you say. How<br />\ndo you know you cannot? Have you tried?<br />\nIf you are musical or shine in the social world,<br />\njoin the musical clubs. If you are big and<br />\nstrong, patronize \"Mac\" and the cage. If<br />\nyou are studious, try for class honors. If you<br />\nare none of the above, but have a sneaking<br />\nfondness for Dr. Green's papers, try for the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER staff.<br />\nIt is to this last class of men that I address<br />\nthis appeal. It is your duty to help the paper,<br />\nbecause if you can write, your work is needed<br />\nin its columns. If the paper is not as good as<br />\nit might be (I am sure the editors will pardon<br />\nme) try and make it better. Criticism is good<br />\nbut work is better. How can the editors ever<br />\nimprove the NEWS-LETTER when everyone<br />\nabuses it, and no one writes for it? Don't be<br />\nlike the basement-loafers who look at their<br />\ncopies on alternate Thursday evenings, and<br />\nthen always say \"Well, it's a pretty bum<br />\nnumber. I don't see why we can't have a<br />\ngood paper here.\" I asked one of these gentlemen one day if he had even done anything<br />\nto make it better, and he said \"Oh, I sent in a<br />\npiece once, but they would'nt take it.\" I<br />\ndiscovered afterward that the piece in question<br />\nwas something on the order of Baccaccio's<br />\nfamous tales\u2014naughty but very nice.<br />\nNow, boys, that is not the way to support<br />\nyour college paper. The NEWS-LETTER represents the literary ability of the Hopkins undergraduate body. To the world at large we are<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nknown by this paper. If we think it is poor,<br />\nwe should make it better. If you think you<br />\ncan write, try for the staff. If you don't make<br />\nit, write for the paper anyhow. If you have<br />\n,no literary ability, don't attempt to criticise<br />\nthose who have. I know you are going to say<br />\n\"Yes, that's true\" and then do nothing. I did<br />\nthe same thing. I am sorry now, and I am<br />\ndoing penance by trying to keep you from my<br />\nerror. There are places on the staff, fill them.<br />\nShow the rest of the world that the Hopkins<br />\nmen are not all ignorant, and,show the rest of<br />\nthe Hopkins men that the class of 1903 is alive to<br />\nits responsibilities.

The \"NEWS-LETTER\" joins with the<br />\nstudent body in expressing its regret at the<br />\nloss from active leadership of one who has<br />\nbeen so conspicuous in athletic circles during<br />\nthe past three years.<br />\nWith the exception of Director Mackdermott, no one connected with the University is<br />\nmore thoroughly alive to our athletic interests,<br />\nnor more completely conversant with every<br />\nbranch of Hopkins sport than Mr. Maddren ;<br />\nwhile together with these qualities he combines<br />\nexecutive ability, and the faculty for imparting enthusiasm among the student ranks.<br />\nWhile Mr. Maddren has retired from his official position, we hope that we may still have<br />\nthe benefit of his advice in athletic matters.<br />\nIn choosing his successor we consider that<br />\nthe Board has exercised great discernment.<br />\nMr. Reese is one who has the athletic interests<br />\nof the University at heart, and anything he<br />\nundertakes is certain of a successful termination. Besides this he may rely upon the cooperation of the students.<br />\nor w<br />\nThe successes of the Track and Field Team<br />\nin the recent indoor meets in this city and<br />\nWashington show plainly that despite our<br />\nheavy losses of last year Hopkins still has a<br />\nteam which comes up to the high standard set<br /><br />\nby the champions of 190o. Some of the best<br />\nmen in the dashes and runs left the University,<br />\nbut those remaining form a nucleus on which<br />\nat the beginning of this year Director Mackdermott started to build. The material in the<br />\nFreshman class was good, and under hard<br />\ntraining soon developed some excellent men in<br />\nthe dashes, so that the first meet brought many<br />\nprizes to the trophy-room. The team has been<br />\nshowing up stronger at every succeeding meet,<br />\nand deserves the heartiest congratulations of<br />\nall Hopkins men for its zealous efforts. Though<br />\nit is composed of men from all branches of the<br />\nUniversity, there are enough younger men on<br />\nthe team to assure a firm foundation for next<br />\nyear.<br />\nor w<br />\nIn our last issue we called attention to the<br />\nduty now confronting us regarding the necessary improvements to be added to American<br />\nLeague Park, for the benefit of Hopkins Athletes. No matter what bright joys the future<br />\nholds in store for us, in the shape of expensive<br />\nathletic fields and green campuses, our present<br />\nneeds are pressing. The musical :clubs have<br />\ngenerously enlisted themselves in the service<br />\nof raising the finances needed for this purpose,<br />\nand will shortly give a concert for tha benefit<br />\nof the athletic fund. It is gratifying to see<br />\nhow the students have responded to the subscription call, and, judging from results thus<br />\nobtained, we predict that they can be counted<br />\nupon to turn out in a body the evening of the<br />\nconcert. Despite our lack of students, our<br />\nathletic victories during the last few years<br />\nhave placed Hopkins upon a higher footing in<br />\nthe athletic world, and this fact together with<br />\nbright prospects for the future should stimulate<br />\nus all to greater activity.<br />\nw<br />\nor<br />\nHE readers of this issue should mark well<br />\nand inwardly digest a communication in<br />\nthese columns headed \"Apello,\" and signed<br />\n\"A Junior\". The moral of the epistle is<br />\npointed at the members of the Class of 1903,<br />\nbut there is no reason why the rest of the<br />\nUniversity should not profit by the excellent<br />\nadvice contained therein. It is broad enough<br />\nto embrace all classes, but, doubtless the reason<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nfor especially admonishing the Freshmen is<br />\nbecause it is usually considered that their juvenile buoyancy is still in the effervescent<br />\nstage, and that their characters have not yet<br />\nbeen moulded into permanent form. In<br />\nby-gone days the \"NEWS\u2014LETTER\" has harped<br />\nupon the theme of a man's duty to his college;<br />\nin days to come it will doubtless continue to sing<br />\nthis lay, but a letter like \"Apello\" coming as<br />\nit does from one not officially connected with<br />\nthis paper, carries with it more weight than<br />\nanything we may say upon the subject. Besides it is an encouraging sign, for it shows<br />\nthat the work of \"by gone days\" is finally<br />\nbearing fruit.<br />\niv or er<br />\nA gratifying recognition of the worth of the<br />\nUniversity has just been witnessed.<br />\nThe German American citizens of Baltimore<br />\npropose to contribute $100,000 towards the<br />\nendowment fund of a million now being raised.<br />\nThis contribution is to establish a chair of<br />\nGerman language and literature.<br />\nIt is reported that $20,000 of the amount<br />\nhas already been raised by fifteen gentlemen<br />\nwho are members of the Germania Club. We<br />\ntake pleasure in voicing the sentiment of gratitude which every Hopkins man must feel towards these liberal-minded gentlemen. Such<br />\ngenerosity should, and doubtless will,serve as<br />\nan object lesson to other beneficently inclined<br />\ncitizens of Baltimore.<br />\nor oir 9r<br />\nTHE HOPKINS CLUB.<br />\nIT is reported that the Johns Hopkins Club<br />\nmay soon move to other quarters. The growing attractiveness and interest would seem to<br />\ndemand a site more easily reached by the<br />\nmembers. The Club boasts of an excellent<br />\nkitchen and buffet, which may be enjoyed at<br />\nvery moderate rates; but the members do not<br />\nlunch or spend their evenings at the club as<br />\nmuch as they might, were the position nearer<br />\nthe University, or on their way from places<br />\nof amusement. Great atttactions too are<br />\noffered to members who wish to occupy rooms<br />\nin the club house. It is felt that this and the<br />\nother good features of the Club will be enhanced by a more central location.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nTHE FRESHMAN BANQUET.<br />\nFreshman banquet, marking as it does<br />\nTHE<br />\nthe cessation of friendly clashes between<br />\nnaughty two and naughty three, was a howling<br />\nSuccess from several standpoints. Almost every<br />\nmember of the clsss attended, the apt speeches<br />\nwere well delivered, and the presence of two<br />\nJuniors during the festivities added a certain<br />\nfascination to the pleasure, and without doubt,<br />\nmade the affair the most unique in the annals<br />\nof similar feeds. The class of 1903 is the first<br />\nto enjoy the distinction of having entertained<br />\nsuch unheard of guests at its Freshmen banquet; and it is greatly to the credit of naughty<br />\nthree that at no time during the evening was<br />\na spirit of animosity exhibited. Songs were<br />\nsung, toasts were responded to, and frequent<br />\nknocks made at the Juniors, but at no time<br />\nwere any attempts made to belittle or discomfort the unexpected guests. Before the last<br />\ncourse had been served the aforementioned<br />\ngentlemen were invited to partake of Freshman<br />\nhospitality. They accordingiy drew up, and<br />\nthe mellowing influences of the spread soon<br />\nhad their effects. Both guests made very appropriate speeches, and assured their entertainers that, with the exception of 1902, naughtythree is the best class that ever entered Hopkins. They ended by expressing sincere apapreciation for the hospitality accorded them.<br />\nAs a toastmaster, Harry K. Tootle proved<br />\nto be the real thing. He was full of catchy<br />\njokes, and always had some bright remark<br />\nto continue the merriment. His address in<br />\nwhich he referred to \"taking the Law into<br />\nour hands\" was greeted with deafening applause. The toast \"Our Newly-Acquired<br />\nPossessions\" was construed by some to refer<br />\nto the Juniors present, instead of Homewood.<br />\nAccordingly, some very good puns were gotten<br />\noff by impromptu speakers. The jolly time<br />\nended with numerous class yells and songs,<br />\ninterspersed with several rousing \"Hullabaloos.\" The menu cards were bound in the<br />\nUniversity colors with \"class '03, J.

Alan Haughton,<br />\nwho was to respond to the toast \"The Ladies.\"<br />\n.As .As<br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\nJohns Hopkins Glee, Banjo and ManHE<br />\ndolin Clubs gave an informal concert at<br />\nthe University Club on the evening of Friday,<br />\nMarch Eighth. This is the first time that the<br />\nClubs have appeared before the public in the<br />\nguise of a paid orchestra, and the result was<br />\nnot altogether successful. The audience did<br />\nnot deem it necessary to stop talking during<br />\nthe songs and other pieces, consequently it<br />\nwas hard for the men to play and sing, and<br />\nstill harder for those who were appreciative to<br />\nhear the music. Altogether the evening was<br />\nnot enjoyable or successful, and it is to be<br />\nhoped that no more such concerts will be<br />\nscheduled.<br />\nAfter a few attempts by the various Clubs<br />\nto make themselves heard, the men gave up,<br />\nand mingled with the crowd in its rush for<br />\nrefreshments. Then the pleasanter part of the<br />\nevening began, for there were a number of<br />\nattractive girls and women present, and several<br />\nJohns Hopkins Professors and Alumni very<br />\nthoughtfully looked after the welfare of the<br />\nmen.<br />\nManager Bird has nearly completed his<br />\narrangements for the Easter trip, and from<br />\npresent prospects it will be as thoroughly successful as the one last year. So far the plans<br />\nare to leave Baltimore Friday afternoon ou one<br />\nof the Bay Line Steamers and give the first<br />\nconcert at Old Point Comfort on Saturday<br />\nnight. This is the very best night in the<br /><br />\nwhole year to attract an audience, and it was<br />\nonly through the energy and perseverance of<br />\nthe manager that this date was obtained. Last<br />\nyear the Clubs had to play second best, and<br />\ngive their concert on Good-Friday when there<br />\nwere necessarily fewer people present. But<br />\nthis year Princeton will have to take our last<br />\nyear's place while the Hopkins Clubs have the<br />\nbest night.<br />\nFrom Old Point Comfort the men will go to<br />\nRichmond and give a concert there on the following Monday\u2014These places are the only<br />\nones that are definitely decided upon, but it is<br />\nlikely that several other cities will be visited<br />\nbefore the Clubs return. There is even a rumor that Atlantic City will be \"taken in,\"<br />\nbut this is a little doubtful.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nTHE SECOND BALTIMORE CONCERT.<br />\nmost important concert in the history<br />\nTHE<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins Musical Clubs will<br />\nbe given in McCoy Hall on Tuesday evening,<br />\nMarch 26. Its great importance lies in the<br />\nfact that the proceeds will be used to help pay<br />\nfor the erection of the club house and gymnasium on the new athletic grounds.<br />\nThe alumni of the University have been doing their utmost to raise the necessary million<br />\ndollar endowment fund, and it would surely<br />\nseem rather ungrateful in the undergraduates<br />\nif they do not heartily support this concert,<br />\nand thus take away the additional responsibility of paying for the club house.<br />\nFrom the manner in which the subscription<br />\nlists have been received, however, it is unlikely that the former Hopkins men will have any<br />\nreason to believe that they are the only ones<br />\ninterested in the welfare of their Alma Mater.<br />\nWWW<br /><br />\nFor the handsome young dudes in far Luzon,<br />\nIt's style to keep just what they choose on.<br />\nWhy, in summer it's meet<br />\nTo appear in the street<br />\nWith just hat, collar, necktie, and shoes on.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n\"BILLY\" MADDREN RESIGNS.<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS GAMES.<br /><br />\nAT a meeting of the Athletic Board, held<br />\nTuesday evening, March 12th, President<br />\n\"Billy\" Maddren handed in the 'following<br />\nletter of resignation:<br /><br />\nCarnival of Sports under the auspices<br />\nTHE<br />\nof the Athletic Association of the Johns<br /><br />\nTo the Board of Directors of the 7ohns Hopkins<br />\nAthletic Association:<br />\nGENTLEMEN,\u2014It is with great regret that I<br />\nam obliged to tender my resignation as President of the Johns Hopkins Athletic Association. My reasons are that I am unable to<br />\ngive sufficient time to athletic affairs because<br />\nof my studies. This resignation is to take<br />\neffect upon the election of my successor, and<br />\nnot later than March i5th. Yours truly,<br />\nWILLIAM HARVEY MADDREN.<br />\nEvery effort was used by the Board to dissuade Mr. Maddren from his course, but he<br />\nexplained that it would be impossible for him<br />\nto devote sufficient time to the duties of presidency, as his studies at the Medical school for<br />\nthe remainder of the year would require hard<br />\nwork and close confinement. With great<br />\nreluctancy the board accepted the resignation,<br />\nand appointed a committee, with Dr. Renouf<br />\nas chairman, to draw up an appropriate resolution in appreciation of Mr. Maddren's work<br />\nin behalf of Hopkins Athletics. It is safe to<br />\nsay, that during the past three years .no other<br />\nstudent of the University has instilled as much<br />\nlife into athletics at Hopkins, as has \"Billy<br />\nMaddren.\" His most conspicuous work has<br />\nbeen in Lacrosse, and it is largely owing to his<br />\nefforts that three championship banners, 1898,<br />\n1899, 1900, now adorn the walls of the trophy<br />\nroom but besides this his advice in athletic<br />\nmatters has been of the greatest benefit, and all<br />\nregret his retirement from active athletics.<br />\nMr. Albert Reese was unanimously elected<br />\nby the Board to fill the position of president.<br />\nMr, Reese is one of the few alumni who has<br />\nnot allowed his interest in J. H. U. sports to<br />\nstop when he received his degree, but has, on<br />\nthe other hand, worked faithfully to advance<br />\nthem. This interest in athletics and his executive ability make him the most suitable man<br />\nwho could have been chosen for the position.<br /><br />\nHopkins University was held on last Saturday night at the Fifth Regiment Armory.<br />\nAthletes from diverse parts of the city and<br />\nstate were entertained by the University men,<br />\nwho gave them a good run for their money.<br />\nThese are the first indoor games that the<br />\nUniversity has given for some years past, and<br />\nthat they were a success is the verdict of everyone. Surely there were some hitches, but, for<br />\nthe most part, the events were run off in good<br />\ntime by the clerk of the course, Wm. M.<br />\nMackdermott, to whom all credit is due for the<br />\nsuccess of the meet.<br />\nThe hall had been very attractively decorated, and when the call was sounded for the<br />\nfirst event at 8.10, the seats lining the walls<br />\naround the floor space of the Armory were<br />\ncomfortably filled with fair enthusiasts who<br />\nhad come out in goodly numbers to cheer their<br />\nespecial favorites on to victory, while the gallery was filled with \"rooters\" of the various<br />\norganizations who had occupied themselves<br />\nwith shouting encouragement to their teams.<br />\nA large share of the honors came to the<br />\nwearers of the Black and Blue, but the representatives of Marston's University School and<br />\nthe Boys' Latin School also came in for a<br />\ngoodly share of the prizes.<br />\nThere was a slight delay in the starting of<br />\nthe game owing to the late arrival of several<br />\nof the officials; but when the games were once<br />\nstarted they went ahead at a pleasing pace. The<br />\nprogram was a very attractive one, being much<br />\nless unwieldy than the ordinary program of<br />\nBaltimore meets. Foot races were the predominant features, while there were only three<br />\nfield events.<br />\nThe first event\u2014the interscholastic 40 yard<br />\ndash\u2014was easily won by G. C. Gantz, of the<br />\nBoys' Latin School, with Bayless and Cloud<br />\nclose on him for second and third honors.<br />\nE. L. Pessagno ran a beautiful race in the<br />\n40 yard open handicap, winning first place, but<br />\nwas closely pressed by Tootle, who won the<br />\n40 yard dash in the Baltimore Athletic games<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nof several weeks ago. Perhaps the races which<br />\ninterested the majority of the spectators were<br />\nthe twelve relay races. In the first, Marston's<br />\neasily defeated the Emerson Institute team, of<br />\nWashington. The Boys' Latin School team<br />\nalso ran a pretty race against Deichmann's.<br />\nThe special invitation relay race between St.<br />\nJohn's College and Johns Hopkins University<br />\nwas one of the prettiest of the evening. The<br />\nfirst two contestants, Whitman and Garey, ran<br />\nalmost a dead heat till the last lap, when Whitman passed his rival and finished a few yards<br />\nahead of him. Unfortunately for St. John's,<br />\nWells was not able to hold his ground on the<br />\nnext lap, and when Riggs took up the work<br />\nwhere England and Hoffman had left off,<br />\nHopkins had a lead of half a lap, and Riggs<br />\nwas able to hold his lead without exertion.<br />\nMullen, who ran under the auspices of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Club, was the only scratch man<br />\nin the mile run. He pushed ahead of all his<br />\nopponents, and caught up with Heiner, who<br />\nwas leading. On the last lap Mullens purted,<br />\nand easily won by io yards.<br />\nIn the 440 yard dash, Riggs ran a beautiful<br />\nrace. On each lap he gradually pushed up<br />\npast his opponents, and won handily on the last<br />\nlap by a beautiful spurt. All the other events,<br />\ntoo, were of equal interest, but perhaps the<br />\nmost amusing of the whole evening was the<br />\npotato race, won by C. F. Edwards. Garret<br />\nwon first in the 16-lb. shot, and second in the<br />\nhigh jump. In the 88o yard, novice, England<br />\nwas the victor.<br />\nTRACK EVENTS.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins University,first; time, 2.36 2-5.<br />\nThe teams ran as follows: J. H. U.\u2014H. Whitman, J.

Such a movement will undoubtedly<br />\nmeet with serious opposition, on account of the<br />\ndeplorable manner in which last year's team<br />\nwas managed, and its untimely end. Yet, if<br />\nthe supporters of this new movement show<br />\nenough earnestness to warrant it, and will<br />\nguarantee a team which will practice, and stand<br />\nby the University during the entire season,<br />\nthere can be no doubt but that the Athletic<br />\nAssociation will give such a team its hearty<br />\nsupport.<br />\nSeveral challenges have been received from<br />\nprominent colleges and associations, and it<br />\nseems rather sad, that we energetic Hopkinsonions who are making such rapid strides in<br />\nother lines of athletic sport, cannot organize<br />\nand support a base-ball team. Probably the<br />\nmain handicap to last year's attempt was the<br />\nlack of grounds out of doors, on which to<br />\npractice. Such is not the case this year, as we<br />\nhave new grounds specially adapted to baseball, at a moderate distance from the University.<br />\nIf the men who are interested in this project<br />\nmean business, and have any hope of organizing a team, it is high time that the movement were being pushed as is is getting late in<br />\nthe season.
