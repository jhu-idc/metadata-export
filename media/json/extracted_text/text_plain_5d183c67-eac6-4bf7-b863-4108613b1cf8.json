And,in the end,<br />\nsociety pays much too heavy a price for it.<br />\nWe did that<br />\nwith Prohibition.,We're doing it with marijuana, and next<br />\nwe're going to do it probably with sex. It's been that way<br />\nwith prostitution for practically as far back as you can<br />\nremember.<br />\n-Whati then do you think might be some of the<br />\nprecipitating causes ofsexual crimes?<br />\nExcessive and rigid' application of the taboos to<br />\nchildren and \u2022 excessive punishment of them in childhood<br />\nwhen they are developing their sexual status. As far as one<br />\nh s the evidence, it is part of Nature's scheme of things<br />\nfor all primates to rehearse sexuality in sexual play, just<br />\nthe same way as they rehearse speech In babbling before<br />\nthey get ready to talk. If you put total veto on infantile.<br />\nand childhood expressions, of sexuality then you get<br />\nanomalies of sexual expression which take the place of<br />\nthe norm. For example, you can see in the clinic without<br />\ntoo much trouble, that a horrendous experience with sex<br />\nin infancy has long-term aftereffects. One case that<br />\nillustrates this is the case of where a baby is threatened,<br />\nithappens not too infrequently, that his penis will be cut<br />\noff with the scissors or the, kitchen carving knife if he<br />\nplays with it. Well, I've known examples where the<br />\naftermath of that was that the kid couldn't ever see a<br />\nknife without having an impulse to cut somebody with it<br />\nsexually. Couldn't get into a love relationship because he<br />\nwas scared he would cut his girlfriend in a sadistic way.<br />\nWell, every person who is a sex offender who gets picked<br />\nup and put in jail for it, has a very poignant history if you<br />\n<br />\napril 29, 19<br />\n<br />\nget them to talk about what's happened to them in the<br />\ncourse of their development from childhood onwards that<br />\ndistorted their sexuality to such an extraordinary degree.<br />\nSo, society, without being aware of what it's doing, is'<br />\nactually producing all of these monstrosities by the very<br />\nact of an attempt at purity.<br />\nWhat do you suggest as treatmentfor sex offenders?<br />\nWell there probably isn't a single answer to your question.<br />\nI can give you two opposite sides of the coin for an<br />\nanswer. Let's take, to illustrate one case, the example of<br />\nthe exhibitionist. If you are riding in a subway late at<br />\nnight and the exhibitionist dares to flash himself to get<br />\nfrom you an expression of surprise, because that's .the<br />\nessential key to the exhibitionist, to get shock or surprise<br />\nfrom the partner, the strangei- who is not expecting to see<br />\nhis penis, and that gets him all geared up and he then can<br />\ngo home with an erection and perform sexually which<br />\nwould not otherwise be possible usually. Well, if you look<br />\nat.that person and don't be surprised, and don't make a<br />\nbig noise and scream, then possibly tell him \"It's too small<br />\n,for me\", then it's such an absolute put-down that he can't<br />\ncontinue anymore, he's finished. So there are ways of<br />\nbeing able to teach the rest of society how to handle the<br />\nperson who's already been sexually crippled by his<br />\nupbringing. If you do have society taught that then it<br />\nrepresents a change towards; sex in our society, so that it<br />\nis possible that within three generations we could bring up<br />\nour children differently that we don't produce anymore<br />\nof these anomalies. Now at the other side of the coin if<br />\nyou're taking the situation as it is today and you've got<br />\nthe person who is a rape murderer, let's say, then<br />\nnobody's going to tolerate him at large. Then you can get<br />\nsome effective relief for that person if you give him a<br />\n- reatment with anti-androgen, Which puts his own male<br />\nsex hormone at rest for as long as you're giving it, also<br />\nprobably has a direct sexual tranquilizing effect of brain<br />\ncells themselves. Then if' you combine that with a<br />\nprogram of counseling you can expect to get that person,<br />\nwell I've used the word, psychically realigned,,in such a<br />\nway that he may not feel safe in this day and age with<br />\nputting him back in society at large, but you certainly<br />\ncould have him on a supervised way of living that is not<br />\nquite so monstrous as complete jail. If you have<br />\n<br />\nsomeone who's simply an exhibitionist who really doesn<br />\never do any dangerous harm to anyone, except sal;<br />\nthem, then it is possible with this form of treatment<br />\nget them rehabilitated so that they don't do it anymor<br />\nDo you. consider giving drugs or surgery to someotie<br />\njail ethical?<br />\nWell' I'll throw the question back at you.

Once all the entries<br />\nwere in, the N-L consulted famous social scientist and<br />\namateur pollster M.R. Bongue to select a scientifically<br />\naccurate sampling of the responses. After extensive<br />\ncooperative research with Dr. Bongue, the staff came up<br />\nwith the 33 random entries that most exactly represent<br />\nthe collective Hopkins undergraduate.<br />\nThe entries, on the whole, indicated a creative impulse<br />\nhidden within the deepest pre-med recesses of the average<br />\nHopkins student. Most replies took the liberty of<br />\nproviding answers outside the strict yes/no requests, of<br />\nwriting extensive comments where one word would have<br />\nsufficed, of posing questions in response to questions; in<br />\nshort, it seems a lot of talent on campus has been<br />\nsmothered under multiple-choice exams and<br />\nproblem-gutted homework.<br />\nTo start, the \"Faculty\" section evoked the widest range<br />\nof responses. No less than 29 personages were bestowed<br />\nthe title of \"Favorite Professor,\" coming from all<br />\ndepartments. Multiple nods went to Drs. Gryder, Crenson,<br />\nCone, Pfeffer, Posner, and Russel-Wood. Honorable<br />\nmentions would take too much space to list -- you know<br />\nWho you are, so keep up the good work.<br />\nThe Henny Youngman Award for best jokes went to<br />\nMichael Hooker (Philosophy), in a tight contest with<br />\nthose who found no professor capable of delivering a<br />\none-liner at the appropriate moment. One reply gave a<br />\nbackhanded compliment to Robert Green, \"for stealing<br />\nthe best jokes from Dr. Pond.\"<br />\nDr. Richard Macksey of the Humanities Center took<br />\nhonors'in the art of obsfucation, although a number of<br />\nvoters picked Drs. Ranum and Kenner as masters of the<br />\nverbal footnote. 8s for the worst advisor; well, a plurality<br />\nrecommended staying away from Gilman 155 for course<br />\ncounseling. At the same time, a sizeable vote came in for<br />\nDr. Dierman, even though it wasn't technically his<br />\ncategory (see below).<br />\nThe. \"n o -e duca tion-at-Hopkins-is-complete-without\"<br />\nquerry, which asked \"Have you ever seen John Barth\"(a<br />\nvariation on the \"Have you ever talked with Muller\"<br />\nroutine), found roughly half the undergraduates fulfilled,<br />\nthe other half still searching. This question elicited quite a<br />\nfew riffs, from \"I once caught a glimpse of his head<br />\n<br />\ntO prO<br />\n<br />\ngleaming across the quad\" to an ecstatic \"Yes, three times<br />\nin fact!\"<br />\nIn the \"Academic\" category, the Math and Chemistry<br />\n'departments finished a close one-two for the worst<br />\ncollection of graduate students. On the other hand,<br />\nBiology took the \"Worst Nerds\" crown in a runaway.<br />\nThat much-desired Homewood delicacy, the gut course,<br />\nbrought 'a surprisingly varied collection of courses to the<br />\nsurface. Everything from Social Psychology to Organic<br />\nChemistry, from Bioengineering Seminars to .Kenner<br />\nclasses got mention as the Nirvana of TheAcademic set. A<br />\ncouple students protested this question, however, saying<br />\n\"There are guts at Hopkins?\" and \"You think I'm going<br />\nto 'ye that aw. ?!\"<br />\n<br />\nNoted pollster Dr. M.R. Bongue<br />\nhe choices for worst and best course were likewise<br />\nunclear; many courses got nominated in both categories.<br />\nGenerally, introductory courses and Psychology offerings<br />\ncame under the most criticism. Meanwhile, there was no<br />\nagreement on the best course, a quandary that should<br />\nhave been expected.<br />\nIn \"Campus\" matters, three rooms vied for position as<br />\nbest lecture hall: Remsen 101, Shaffer 3, and Maryland 110.<br />\nRemsen I emerged as the solid choice for worst room on<br />\ncampus. No consensus emerged on library levels; C and B<br />\ndrew strong support as the favorite levels, though DX,<br />\nand M all had their loyal followers. In the case of class<br />\ntimes, the hours before noon were<br />\nprogressively hated, with 9:00 the most despised. The<br />\nreplies evidenced no great love for 4:00 classes, either,<br />\n<br />\nessors<br />\n<br />\nand a few found \"anytime\" to be a bad time for a course.<br />\nFood? A brave 10% ,stated they would eat Servomation<br />\nofferings even when endowed with free will, one<br />\ncourageous (or gluttonous) soul writing \"Sure!\"<br />\nThe question of what to do with that perennial<br />\nheadache, Garland Hall, engendered the most imaginative<br />\nsolutions of the poll. The proferred choices all received<br />\nnominal support, with a parking lot edging out the<br />\nproposed bowling alley and tennis courts. Individual calls<br />\ncame for replacement with McDonald's, a Mexican<br />\nrestaurant, a stable and riding course, a sex counseling<br />\ncenter, and an all-night organic lab. Many wanted a \"piece<br />\nof the Block\" on campus, in the form of a combined<br />\nsaloon/brothel. And a canny few thought Garland Hall<br />\nshould be removed in favor of an administration building.<br />\nFinally, in the \"General\" section, respondents were<br />\nasked to rate President Muller's performance (\"I thought<br />\nCarter was President,\" one person noted). \"Say what\"<br />\ntook 32% of the vote, \"Fair\" next at' 21% the rest<br />\nscattered from 'Excellent' to \"Poor\" and one \"Cute.\"<br />\nComplaints Were registered that Muller only paid<br />\nattention to grad students.<br />\nDr. Dierman, a near-winner earlier, handily beat out Dr.<br />\nSuskind 3-1 for disfavor. Whether Hopkins is worth the<br />\nmoney coughed up by undergraduates (that is, their<br />\nparents) was hotly contested, with about equal numbers<br />\nsaying \"Ay and t. Nay.\" One terminally disillusioned<br />\nstudent scribbled little \"Ha-Ha's\" around the border of<br />\nthe entry, while another casually explained \"No... but<br />\nthen again, I'm on financial aid.\"<br />\nBy a 60-40 margin, students found the Hopkins<br />\npastime of lacrosse \"not that big a deal, \"though a<br />\ncouple negative votes had the qualifications \"only when<br />\nbloody\" and \"If you like French cuisine.\"<br />\nFor the last bit of information, the entrants had to try<br />\nto identify themselves (for _untold demographic<br />\npurposes). It seemed self-rated \"derelicts\" sent in the<br />\nmost replies, with a good number of \"jocks\" and \"nerds\"<br />\nalso responding. The plurality; though, went to the<br />\n\"other\" denomination, wherein species ranging from<br />\n\"closet pre-med\" through \"person\" to \"sweet young<br />\nthing\" appeared. One student went so far as to!declare<br />\nthat \"I also look liket Jimmy Carter,\" obviously someone<br />\nfamiliar with the vagaries of poll-taking.<br />\nAs a finale, the headline-cum-title of the poll, \"Who is<br />\nyour worst professor?\", must, for now, remain<br />\nunanswered. It seems the computer broke down on that<br />\none, spewing out names and numbers in an electric<br />\nfrenzy. Sorry.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 4<br />\n<br />\nEar<br />\n<br />\nl Hines looks amazingly like Bobby Short, thL. New<br />\nYork sophisticate, song interpreter par excellence. Hines,<br />\nresembles Short, except that while Short exudes New<br />\nYork's 'East Side in the best of times, Hines carries with<br />\nhim the Chicago of the forties. Class, but the kind of class<br />\nthat doesn't need the sheer polish of money, like a suit<br />\nthat looks good even off the models who never seem so<br />\nmuch as to sweat.<br />\nHe sits at the piano on the cramped stage and rambles<br />\ninto an introduction, hitting notes and playing runs as if<br />\nhe was just warming up, untiLbefore you reali7e what he's<br />\nplayed, the whole thing falls together as the most intricate<br />\ndevelopment of that tune you've ever heard. Of course,<br />\nit's a tune that you've heard countless times before, but<br />\nnone the less, each chorus sounds different, not merely<br />\nfrom the succeeding choruses, but from any previous<br />\nperformance in memory.<br />\nHines looks about the right age to have grown up<br />\nplaying bebop. Indeed, both Charlie Parker and Dizzy<br />\nGillespie were in his band in Chicago, as was Billy<br />\nEckstine, who put together the first Bop Big Band,<br />\ndrawing heavily from the Hines alumnae (one prize was'<br />\nsinger Sarah Vaughn). Yeah, Hines played with the early<br />\nboppers. He also played with the young Louis Armstrong,<br />\nand not as an apprentice either. As an equal.<br />\n\"I met Louis, and that's what caused us to be friends,'<br />\nsays Hines of his early style. \"We were both playing the<br />\nsame style, only I was playing the piano, and he was<br />\nplaying the trumpet. Now, the reason I was playing it on<br />\npiano is because back in the days when I started, way<br />\nbefore I ever heard Armstrong, I was playing this way in<br />\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I was playing the \"trumpetstyle\" because they couldn't hear ragtime in the classical<br />\nstyle I was using, the fingering... So the only way I could<br />\nget heard was to play what I wanted to play, only instead<br />\nof playing it on trumpet, I played it on piano. That's<br />\nwhere it started.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"The only hope I see for<br />\nany young musician is to<br />\n'learn your horn.'\"<br />\nHines goes'into a medley: West Side Story. The medley<br />\nform suits Hines to the point that you'd think he invented<br />\nit. In a way he did; as critic and producer Don Schaten<br />\nput it, Hines' improvisations are so full of other songs,<br />\nwhen he slides into anew tunei_it's almost as if the new<br />\ntune had been improvised on the spot. The same happens<br />\nwith West Side Story. Hines trots the melodies out as if<br />\nthey were his own, and plays with them as he wants. For<br />\ninstance, I Feel Pretty sounds suspiciously like it was<br />\nwritten by Fats Wailer;,<br />\nmoreover, Chicago appears<br />\n<br />\napril 29, 1977<br />\n<br />\nnews-letter<br />\n<br />\nFatha Hines:<br />\nOriginaljazz<br />\nBy J.D.Considine<br />\n<br />\nmysteriously before the finale (\"It was the West Side of<br />\nChicago,\" he says at the end).<br />\nYou might expect the back-up musicians to look pretty<br />\nmuch the same as Hines. Rudy Rutterford, smoothly<br />\ndressed, jocular, easily middle-aged, seems the perfect<br />\nman for the part, as he roars in his best Coleman Hawkins<br />\nsytle through a tenor sax blues. The bandstand displays an<br />\nalto, a tenor, a soprano, a clarinet, a C flute and a G flute.<br />\nOnly four of the six get used.<br />\nThe drum set features a series of tuned toms,just right<br />\nfor those impressive around- the-set paradidles crowds<br />\nlove. Eddie Graham, young, British-looking, sits behind<br />\nthe traps, bursting energy. He's a young drummer, which<br />\nseems good enough excuse for his lengthy solos consisting<br />\nalmost entirely of Buddy Rich/Gene K rupa cliches. He<br />\ngets two fifteen minute solos, which most of the crowd<br />\n<br />\nlove. In short, he's fast, flashy and fun, which, you guess,<br />\nmakes up for his lack of ideas.<br />\nJ ohnny Orr fools you.. Unlike Graham, whose flurry of<br />\nnotes seem to hide a lack of quality, Orr's basswork seems<br />\nalmost reticent, as if he were afraid to say something.<br />\nUntil he solos. Small children are often told to merely<br />\nspeak when spoken to, and when Or finally speaks, it's<br />\ngenius. Brilliant runs, flawless double-stops, and an<br />\nexquisite melodic sense combine for solos which carry the<br />\nquiet brilliance of a Picasso drawing.<br />\n\"Nobody's backing the young man who decides to<br />\nkeep J azz going as a cultural art... You've got young<br />\npeople coming out of the schools today that are great<br />\nmusicians, but where are they going? Nobody's making<br />\nany openings, nobody.\"<br />\nIt would be easy to dismiss Hines as just another old<br />\nmusician who regrets passing of<br />\nhis time, until you learn about his non-musical life. For<br />\nexample, that he is currently the President of the Overseas<br />\nPress Club. That he speaks frequently with the State<br />\nDepartment's Arts Programs Co-Ordinators. That, while<br />\nplaying at a reception or Gerald Ford and Valery<br />\nGiscard D'Estaing, he spoke to the President about the<br />\nimportance of government involvement in the Arts.<br />\nHe thinks that there should be a Secretary for the Arts;<br />\n\"I've been fighting for that for years, and, God bless the<br />\ndead, Ellington too... But we're just a couple of people...\"<br />\nHe intends to speak to President Carter when he plays for<br />\nhim, but is worried because he is unsure where Carter<br />\nstands.<br />\nBut it is with the young, Hines feels, the answer lies.<br />\n\"There's not a kid you know that's not interested in Bugs<br />\nBunny. So why not open up an avenue for music?\"<br />\nGetting the message across, that music is something<br />\nvaluable in itself--that's what is needed.\"The trouble with<br />\nthe United States is they're commercial...They're trying<br />\nto put music, as far as success is concerned, in the<br />\ncategory of sports.\"<br />\n\"The only hope I see for any young musician is learn<br />\nyour horn.' Learn your instrument. Don't pick it up by<br />\near. Years ago, when we had the big bands, you had to<br />\nknow what to do to be in the band... We went down to<br />\nrecord because we wanted to hear ourselves, perfect<br />\nourselves...\" The drive for excellence, for music for its<br />\nown sake seems all that is needed to make the world run<br />\nsmoothly.<br />\nIt also seems very dry. Dry, until you think back to<br />\nMarva Josie, the band's vocalist, swinging through Jelly,<br />\nJelly in a down home, no holds barred performance, that<br />\nwould have Dinah Washington blushing with envy. It's not<br />\nuntil you realize that these cats4swinging their asses off in<br />\nthe dirtiest down-home blues you ever heard - are all cats<br />\nwho know their aces better than their friends, that what<br />\nHines says really makes sense.<br />\n<br />\narts calendar<br />\nConcerts<br />\n<br />\nYou always look in this window but you never go in.

The actions<br />\nLance undertakes, and the plans he evolves for a<br />\nNew World, are based upon the \"Great Secret of<br />\nLife 'as he discerns it: 'God's secret design for<br />\nman is that man's happiness lies for men in men<br />\npracticing violence upon women and that women's<br />\nhappiness lies in submitting to it.

But the past only reveals<br />\nroads not taken, false triumphs, fragments shored<br />\nagainst his ruins. The present receives neither<br />\n<br />\njustification nor clarification from the past. For<br />\nLance, \"the mystery lies in the here and now,\"<br />\nand it grows ever more mysterious as one comes to<br />\nrecognize the overwhelming magnitude of that<br />\ncentral question : \"What is one to do with<br />\noneself?\" \\It may be the case that what Lance<br />\ndoes is in fact his undoing.<br />\nLance's story oscillates between a dark perverse<br />\ndespair and a strange frenzied hope.

Now he's Oven up the airwaves, in both<br />\nsenses, and has his feet tied securely to the copy<br />\ndesk of his old newspaper. He's 42, married, the<br />\nfather of two children, has a nice wife and blue<br />\nhair. He's vulnerable to only one substance:<br />\nCronkite \u2014and perhaps the ravages of time,<br />\nbecause, after eight years of retirement, his<br />\nsuper-powers are definitely on the wane.<br />\nHe has had attacks of weakness and has lost<br />\nconfidence in himself\u2014as well as in the general<br />\norder. What could any superhero do faced with<br />\npolitical assassinations, racial disturbances,<br />\nVietnam and rampant street crime? The world has<br />\ncome of age and the problems seem<br />\ninsurmountable.<br />\nThat is how Brinkley feels until a fateful news<br />\nflash draws him unexpectedly out of his suburban<br />\nshell and back into the real world of crime and<br />\nviolence. But he has been devitalized so much that<br />\nhe crashes into atree in hisfirst attempt to leap tall<br />\nbuildings. Is there a criminal mastermind, and a<br />\nfoul plot to dispose of the last of the superheroes?<br />\nThe plot thickens...<br />\n\"Superfolks\" is a good, old-fashioned<br />\nmis-adventure story made contemporary by liberal<br />\ndoses of political intrigue, sex and some hilarious<br />\nexamples of celebrity malapropisms. Mayer<br />\nhandles it all with grace and ease.<br />\nAnd well he might. First novel or not, his name<br />\nought to have a familiar ring to it. For 10 years he<br />\nwas reporter and later a columnist for Newsday, a<br />\ngreat metropolitan newspaper. While he was there<br />\nhe won numerous awards for writing excellence,<br />\nincluding a National Headliners' Club award.<br />\nMayer seems to have kept his foot on the<br />\naccelerator the whole time in the story. It has a<br />\nsparkling beginning, just the slightest trace of<br />\nmiddle-pages spread and a clever end. The work is<br />\na whole, and a whole lot of fun, due to the<br />\nauthor's skill and imagination. I His gibes at the<br />\nnews industry and other writers have punch and<br />\nstyle, especially the parody on Norman Mailer's highly personal and often excessive style of<br />\nreportage.<br />\n\"Superfolks\" is the kind of book that could give<br />\nlightweight fiction a good name. It is some of the<br />\nbest of recent efforts at the genre, written to<br />\nentertain. Give it a read. It's far better than any<br />\nnight of the week on TV.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8'<br />\n<br />\nnews-letter<br />\n<br />\napril 29, 1977<br />\n<br />\nThe new PALANTIR is out!

Especially those few that happen to be<br />\nragged local punks or overeager lacrosse players\u2014it<br />\ndoesn't take too many Schlitz lights or poorly-chosen<br />\nwords to bring out the worst in people.<br />\nThe knifing incidents in the freshman quad are general<br />\nknowledge: one Hopkins student slashed and a teenager<br />\ncut in a back-and-forth brawl around the ride area. Along<br />\nwith this well-known melee, there were a number of<br />\nminor scuffles. One in particular took place about a<br />\nhalf-hour before the stabbings, precipitated by the same<br />\ngroup responsible for the later scuffles.<br />\nCharacterizing the Friday night fight was a uniform<br />\nlack of sensible action by the campus police. Those<br />\non-hand for the entire affair, and others involved in<br />\nisolated fistfights, had common complaints about the<br />\nfumblings of the blue-uniformed security force. After the<br />\ninitial outburst in the freshman quad\u2014rather serious with<br />\none man ganged up on by local youths\u2014the campus cops<br />\nfailed to respond to repeated warnings and identifications<br />\nof the troublemakers. Instead, they waited for the arrival<br />\nof city police, making no attempts at crowd control and<br />\nstaying clear of those pointed out as brawlers, the ones<br />\nwho would later start the knife fights. \"The cops were<br />\nIntimidated more. than anything, just scared,\" said one<br />\nobFrvor.<br />\n<br />\nor-<br />\n<br />\n%en the city police got to the freshmen quad they<br />\nreceived little help from campus security in the way of<br />\nrounding up the instigators. Outside of the people stabbed<br />\nor those who actually fought with the city police, the<br />\noriginal gang that had been repeatedly identified to the<br />\ncampus police was relatively ignored (in fact, they<br />\nreappeared Sunday at the Fair, ready for more<br />\nencounters.)<br />\nOnce the city police cleared the amusement area in the<br />\nfreshman quad, they toliped.off a confused evening by<br />\nproceeding to the Gilman Quad, where a jazz band had<br />\nbeen scheduled for a 9:30 show. The band had moved<br />\nindoors to the Glass Pavilion, apparently for fear of rain. \u2022<br />\nUnfortunately, there was little notice given to those<br />\n<br />\nmilling about the Quad, wondering what had become of<br />\nthe performance.

And,in the end,<br />\nsociety pays much too heavy a price for it.<br />\nWe did that<br />\nwith Prohibition.,We're doing it with marijuana, and next<br />\nwe're going to do it probably with sex. It's been that way<br />\nwith prostitution for practically as far back as you can<br />\nremember.<br />\n-Whati then do you think might be some of the<br />\nprecipitating causes ofsexual crimes?<br />\nExcessive and rigid' application of the taboos to<br />\nchildren and \u2022 excessive punishment of them in childhood<br />\nwhen they are developing their sexual status. As far as one<br />\nh s the evidence, it is part of Nature's scheme of things<br />\nfor all primates to rehearse sexuality in sexual play, just<br />\nthe same way as they rehearse speech In babbling before<br />\nthey get ready to talk. If you put total veto on infantile.<br />\nand childhood expressions, of sexuality then you get<br />\nanomalies of sexual expression which take the place of<br />\nthe norm. For example, you can see in the clinic without<br />\ntoo much trouble, that a horrendous experience with sex<br />\nin infancy has long-term aftereffects. One case that<br />\nillustrates this is the case of where a baby is threatened,<br />\nithappens not too infrequently, that his penis will be cut<br />\noff with the scissors or the, kitchen carving knife if he<br />\nplays with it. Well, I've known examples where the<br />\naftermath of that was that the kid couldn't ever see a<br />\nknife without having an impulse to cut somebody with it<br />\nsexually. Couldn't get into a love relationship because he<br />\nwas scared he would cut his girlfriend in a sadistic way.<br />\nWell, every person who is a sex offender who gets picked<br />\nup and put in jail for it, has a very poignant history if you<br /><br />\napril 29, 19<br /><br />\nget them to talk about what's happened to them in the<br />\ncourse of their development from childhood onwards that<br />\ndistorted their sexuality to such an extraordinary degree.<br />\nSo, society, without being aware of what it's doing, is'<br />\nactually producing all of these monstrosities by the very<br />\nact of an attempt at purity.<br />\nWhat do you suggest as treatmentfor sex offenders?<br />\nWell there probably isn't a single answer to your question.<br />\nI can give you two opposite sides of the coin for an<br />\nanswer. Let's take, to illustrate one case, the example of<br />\nthe exhibitionist. If you are riding in a subway late at<br />\nnight and the exhibitionist dares to flash himself to get<br />\nfrom you an expression of surprise, because that's .the<br />\nessential key to the exhibitionist, to get shock or surprise<br />\nfrom the partner, the strangei- who is not expecting to see<br />\nhis penis, and that gets him all geared up and he then can<br />\ngo home with an erection and perform sexually which<br />\nwould not otherwise be possible usually. Well, if you look<br />\nat.that person and don't be surprised, and don't make a<br />\nbig noise and scream, then possibly tell him \"It's too small<br />\n,for me\", then it's such an absolute put-down that he can't<br />\ncontinue anymore, he's finished. So there are ways of<br />\nbeing able to teach the rest of society how to handle the<br />\nperson who's already been sexually crippled by his<br />\nupbringing. If you do have society taught that then it<br />\nrepresents a change towards; sex in our society, so that it<br />\nis possible that within three generations we could bring up<br />\nour children differently that we don't produce anymore<br />\nof these anomalies. Now at the other side of the coin if<br />\nyou're taking the situation as it is today and you've got<br />\nthe person who is a rape murderer, let's say, then<br />\nnobody's going to tolerate him at large. Then you can get<br />\nsome effective relief for that person if you give him a<br />\n- reatment with anti-androgen, Which puts his own male<br />\nsex hormone at rest for as long as you're giving it, also<br />\nprobably has a direct sexual tranquilizing effect of brain<br />\ncells themselves. Then if' you combine that with a<br />\nprogram of counseling you can expect to get that person,<br />\nwell I've used the word, psychically realigned,,in such a<br />\nway that he may not feel safe in this day and age with<br />\nputting him back in society at large, but you certainly<br />\ncould have him on a supervised way of living that is not<br />\nquite so monstrous as complete jail. If you have<br /><br />\nsomeone who's simply an exhibitionist who really doesn<br />\never do any dangerous harm to anyone, except sal;<br />\nthem, then it is possible with this form of treatment<br />\nget them rehabilitated so that they don't do it anymor<br />\nDo you. consider giving drugs or surgery to someotie<br />\njail ethical?<br />\nWell' I'll throw the question back at you. If there's(<br />\nrapist who feels totally incapable of controlling<br />\nbehavior, and<br />\nsay that feeling\u2022 that they're no 111\u00b0<br />\ncapable of controlling it than an epileptic is Of stoppla<br />\nthe next epileptic attack, and if there. was a reasonabl<br />\ngood chance that by doing brain surgery you could mal,<br />\nit possible for him not to have to be an impulsive rapis<br />\nanymore, and I mean dangerously violent and maYb<br />\nkilling, which would you think is better: to require him t\u00b0<br />\ngo into the gas chamber and be dead forever or to take<br />\nthe surgical treatment in the hope that it would all\u00b0<br />\nhim to live the rest of his life without sex in it?<br /><br />\n`...we are, with great difficulty,<br />\nadjusting ourselves to the Birth<br />\nControl Age...'<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBut is he being coerced because he doesn't want to die?

It used to be<br />\nthere<br />\nthat<br />\nw ould<br />\nbe a new Opera every season for the great opera houses of<br />\nEurope, but those days are long gone. Today the expense,<br />\nthe risk, and the reluctance of major companies to<br />\nperform new works seem to preclude any but the very<br />\nbest of the new composers from the ranks of the opera<br />\nmasters.<br />\nThus, it is no small achievement to bring a new opera<br />\nto Baltimore. Let alone a new Opera by a Peabody<br />\ngradute, and a Pulitzer Prize winner at that. But it will<br />\nhappen, and it will mark the opening of the<br />\nPeabody-Hopkins merger as a benefit for the financially<br />\nbeleaguered conservatory.<br />\nThe Voyage of Edgar Allan Poe is Dominick Argento's<br />\nvision of Poe's last journey. It concerns itself with the last<br />\ndays of the writer's life, which started with a boat trip in<br />\nRichmond and ended in death in a gutter in Baltimore.<br />\nWhat happened in between remains a mystery, and that<br />\nmystery was the spark that lit the idea for the opera. With<br />\na libretto by Argento's colleague at the University of<br />\nMinnesota, Charles Nolte, the Opera had its premiere in<br />\nSt. Paul in 1976 with the Minnesota Opera Company.<br />\nHope Quackenbush, the promotion director for the<br />\nMorris Mechanic Theatre, was one of the audience.<br />\nMrs. Quackenbush knew that Minnesota Opera had the<br />\nsingers and the sets, and felt sure that Baltimore could<br />\nsupply the orchestra and chorus for the work's much<br />\nneeded East Coast premiere, so why not? The Baltimore<br /><br />\n.New Peabody _Director Elliot Galkin in action<br />\nOpera Company proved more than willing, and the 'Johns<br />\nGalkin, whose appointment was confirmed by Hopkins<br />\nHopkins University saw the Opera as the most suitable<br />\nPresident Steve Muller, is the ideal choice for the peabody<br />\nvehicle for a benefit for the Peabody. Thus, ont,June 6, Director, as his comprehension of both the musical and<br />\nThe Voyage of Edgar Allan Poe will receive its East Coast<br />\nacademic should prove invaluable to his efforts to afford a<br />\npremiere.<br />\nsmooth and equitable integration of Hopkins and<br />\nThis performance will also mark the appointment of ' -Peabody students. As he was quoted in the ;Sun(8 April,<br />\nElliot Galkin as the director of the Peabody. Galkin, who<br />\n1977), he will try \"to develop the kinds of programs that<br />\nin addition to his teaching duties at Hopkins, Goucher<br />\nwould exploit to the fullest the resources of both the<br />\n(where he heads the music department), and Peabody, is<br />\nPeabody Institute and theJ ohns Hopkins University.\"<br />\nthe music critic for the Baltimore Sun, as well as the<br />\nWell, an opera is an awfully big event for a<br />\npresident of the Music Critic Assocation.<br />\n-housewarming party, but then, this is an awfully big<br />\n(To expound upon his career would prove almost<br />\nhousewarming.

An overworked N-L tabulations staff<br />\nworked long into last night, furiously collating the data<br />\nfrom the \"Who is your worst professor?\" poll. The poll,<br />\nissued two weeks ago, received an overwhelming response<br />\n- the heavier mail days required three of the burlier<br />\nmembers of the delivery crew to tote the stacks of<br />\nresponses back to the Gatehouse. Once all the entries<br />\nwere in, the N-L consulted famous social scientist and<br />\namateur pollster M.R. Bongue to select a scientifically<br />\naccurate sampling of the responses. After extensive<br />\ncooperative research with Dr. Bongue, the staff came up<br />\nwith the 33 random entries that most exactly represent<br />\nthe collective Hopkins undergraduate.<br />\nThe entries, on the whole, indicated a creative impulse<br />\nhidden within the deepest pre-med recesses of the average<br />\nHopkins student. Most replies took the liberty of<br />\nproviding answers outside the strict yes/no requests, of<br />\nwriting extensive comments where one word would have<br />\nsufficed, of posing questions in response to questions; in<br />\nshort, it seems a lot of talent on campus has been<br />\nsmothered under multiple-choice exams and<br />\nproblem-gutted homework.<br />\nTo start, the \"Faculty\" section evoked the widest range<br />\nof responses. No less than 29 personages were bestowed<br />\nthe title of \"Favorite Professor,\" coming from all<br />\ndepartments. Multiple nods went to Drs. Gryder, Crenson,<br />\nCone, Pfeffer, Posner, and Russel-Wood. Honorable<br />\nmentions would take too much space to list -- you know<br />\nWho you are, so keep up the good work.<br />\nThe Henny Youngman Award for best jokes went to<br />\nMichael Hooker (Philosophy), in a tight contest with<br />\nthose who found no professor capable of delivering a<br />\none-liner at the appropriate moment. One reply gave a<br />\nbackhanded compliment to Robert Green, \"for stealing<br />\nthe best jokes from Dr. Pond.\"<br />\nDr. Richard Macksey of the Humanities Center took<br />\nhonors'in the art of obsfucation, although a number of<br />\nvoters picked Drs. Ranum and Kenner as masters of the<br />\nverbal footnote. 8s for the worst advisor; well, a plurality<br />\nrecommended staying away from Gilman 155 for course<br />\ncounseling. At the same time, a sizeable vote came in for<br />\nDr. Dierman, even though it wasn't technically his<br />\ncategory (see below).<br />\nThe. \"n o -e duca tion-at-Hopkins-is-complete-without\"<br />\nquerry, which asked \"Have you ever seen John Barth\"(a<br />\nvariation on the \"Have you ever talked with Muller\"<br />\nroutine), found roughly half the undergraduates fulfilled,<br />\nthe other half still searching. This question elicited quite a<br />\nfew riffs, from \"I once caught a glimpse of his head<br /><br />\ntO prO<br /><br />\ngleaming across the quad\" to an ecstatic \"Yes, three times<br />\nin fact!\"<br />\nIn the \"Academic\" category, the Math and Chemistry<br />\n'departments finished a close one-two for the worst<br />\ncollection of graduate students. On the other hand,<br />\nBiology took the \"Worst Nerds\" crown in a runaway.<br />\nThat much-desired Homewood delicacy, the gut course,<br />\nbrought 'a surprisingly varied collection of courses to the<br />\nsurface. Everything from Social Psychology to Organic<br />\nChemistry, from Bioengineering Seminars to .Kenner<br />\nclasses got mention as the Nirvana of TheAcademic set. A<br />\ncouple students protested this question, however, saying<br />\n\"There are guts at Hopkins?\" and \"You think I'm going<br />\nto 'ye that aw. ?!\"<br /><br />\nNoted pollster Dr. M.R. Bongue<br />\nhe choices for worst and best course were likewise<br />\nunclear; many courses got nominated in both categories.<br />\nGenerally, introductory courses and Psychology offerings<br />\ncame under the most criticism. Meanwhile, there was no<br />\nagreement on the best course, a quandary that should<br />\nhave been expected.<br />\nIn \"Campus\" matters, three rooms vied for position as<br />\nbest lecture hall: Remsen 101, Shaffer 3, and Maryland 110.<br />\nRemsen I emerged as the solid choice for worst room on<br />\ncampus. No consensus emerged on library levels; C and B<br />\ndrew strong support as the favorite levels, though DX,<br />\nand M all had their loyal followers. In the case of class<br />\ntimes, the hours before noon were<br />\nprogressively hated, with 9:00 the most despised. The<br />\nreplies evidenced no great love for 4:00 classes, either,<br /><br />\nessors<br /><br />\nand a few found \"anytime\" to be a bad time for a course.<br />\nFood? A brave 10% ,stated they would eat Servomation<br />\nofferings even when endowed with free will, one<br />\ncourageous (or gluttonous) soul writing \"Sure!\"<br />\nThe question of what to do with that perennial<br />\nheadache, Garland Hall, engendered the most imaginative<br />\nsolutions of the poll. The proferred choices all received<br />\nnominal support, with a parking lot edging out the<br />\nproposed bowling alley and tennis courts. Individual calls<br />\ncame for replacement with McDonald's, a Mexican<br />\nrestaurant, a stable and riding course, a sex counseling<br />\ncenter, and an all-night organic lab. Many wanted a \"piece<br />\nof the Block\" on campus, in the form of a combined<br />\nsaloon/brothel. And a canny few thought Garland Hall<br />\nshould be removed in favor of an administration building.<br />\nFinally, in the \"General\" section, respondents were<br />\nasked to rate President Muller's performance (\"I thought<br />\nCarter was President,\" one person noted). \"Say what\"<br />\ntook 32% of the vote, \"Fair\" next at' 21% the rest<br />\nscattered from 'Excellent' to \"Poor\" and one \"Cute.\"<br />\nComplaints Were registered that Muller only paid<br />\nattention to grad students.<br />\nDr. Dierman, a near-winner earlier, handily beat out Dr.<br />\nSuskind 3-1 for disfavor. Whether Hopkins is worth the<br />\nmoney coughed up by undergraduates (that is, their<br />\nparents) was hotly contested, with about equal numbers<br />\nsaying \"Ay and t. Nay.\" One terminally disillusioned<br />\nstudent scribbled little \"Ha-Ha's\" around the border of<br />\nthe entry, while another casually explained \"No... but<br />\nthen again, I'm on financial aid.\"<br />\nBy a 60-40 margin, students found the Hopkins<br />\npastime of lacrosse \"not that big a deal, \"though a<br />\ncouple negative votes had the qualifications \"only when<br />\nbloody\" and \"If you like French cuisine.\"<br />\nFor the last bit of information, the entrants had to try<br />\nto identify themselves (for _untold demographic<br />\npurposes). It seemed self-rated \"derelicts\" sent in the<br />\nmost replies, with a good number of \"jocks\" and \"nerds\"<br />\nalso responding. The plurality; though, went to the<br />\n\"other\" denomination, wherein species ranging from<br />\n\"closet pre-med\" through \"person\" to \"sweet young<br />\nthing\" appeared. One student went so far as to!declare<br />\nthat \"I also look liket Jimmy Carter,\" obviously someone<br />\nfamiliar with the vagaries of poll-taking.<br />\nAs a finale, the headline-cum-title of the poll, \"Who is<br />\nyour worst professor?\", must, for now, remain<br />\nunanswered. It seems the computer broke down on that<br />\none, spewing out names and numbers in an electric<br />\nfrenzy. Sorry.<br /><br />\npage 4<br /><br />\nEar<br /><br />\nl Hines looks amazingly like Bobby Short, thL. New<br />\nYork sophisticate, song interpreter par excellence. Hines,<br />\nresembles Short, except that while Short exudes New<br />\nYork's 'East Side in the best of times, Hines carries with<br />\nhim the Chicago of the forties. Class, but the kind of class<br />\nthat doesn't need the sheer polish of money, like a suit<br />\nthat looks good even off the models who never seem so<br />\nmuch as to sweat.<br />\nHe sits at the piano on the cramped stage and rambles<br />\ninto an introduction, hitting notes and playing runs as if<br />\nhe was just warming up, untiLbefore you reali7e what he's<br />\nplayed, the whole thing falls together as the most intricate<br />\ndevelopment of that tune you've ever heard. Of course,<br />\nit's a tune that you've heard countless times before, but<br />\nnone the less, each chorus sounds different, not merely<br />\nfrom the succeeding choruses, but from any previous<br />\nperformance in memory.<br />\nHines looks about the right age to have grown up<br />\nplaying bebop. Indeed, both Charlie Parker and Dizzy<br />\nGillespie were in his band in Chicago, as was Billy<br />\nEckstine, who put together the first Bop Big Band,<br />\ndrawing heavily from the Hines alumnae (one prize was'<br />\nsinger Sarah Vaughn). Yeah, Hines played with the early<br />\nboppers. He also played with the young Louis Armstrong,<br />\nand not as an apprentice either. As an equal.<br />\n\"I met Louis, and that's what caused us to be friends,'<br />\nsays Hines of his early style. \"We were both playing the<br />\nsame style, only I was playing the piano, and he was<br />\nplaying the trumpet. Now, the reason I was playing it on<br />\npiano is because back in the days when I started, way<br />\nbefore I ever heard Armstrong, I was playing this way in<br />\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I was playing the \"trumpetstyle\" because they couldn't hear ragtime in the classical<br />\nstyle I was using, the fingering... So the only way I could<br />\nget heard was to play what I wanted to play, only instead<br />\nof playing it on trumpet, I played it on piano. That's<br />\nwhere it started.\"<br /><br />\n\"The only hope I see for<br />\nany young musician is to<br />\n'learn your horn.'\"<br />\nHines goes'into a medley: West Side Story. The medley<br />\nform suits Hines to the point that you'd think he invented<br />\nit. In a way he did; as critic and producer Don Schaten<br />\nput it, Hines' improvisations are so full of other songs,<br />\nwhen he slides into anew tunei_it's almost as if the new<br />\ntune had been improvised on the spot. The same happens<br />\nwith West Side Story. Hines trots the melodies out as if<br />\nthey were his own, and plays with them as he wants. For<br />\ninstance, I Feel Pretty sounds suspiciously like it was<br />\nwritten by Fats Wailer;,<br />\nmoreover, Chicago appears<br /><br />\napril 29, 1977<br /><br />\nnews-letter<br /><br />\nFatha Hines:<br />\nOriginaljazz<br />\nBy J.D.Considine<br /><br />\nmysteriously before the finale (\"It was the West Side of<br />\nChicago,\" he says at the end).<br />\nYou might expect the back-up musicians to look pretty<br />\nmuch the same as Hines. Rudy Rutterford, smoothly<br />\ndressed, jocular, easily middle-aged, seems the perfect<br />\nman for the part, as he roars in his best Coleman Hawkins<br />\nsytle through a tenor sax blues. The bandstand displays an<br />\nalto, a tenor, a soprano, a clarinet, a C flute and a G flute.<br />\nOnly four of the six get used.<br />\nThe drum set features a series of tuned toms,just right<br />\nfor those impressive around- the-set paradidles crowds<br />\nlove. Eddie Graham, young, British-looking, sits behind<br />\nthe traps, bursting energy. He's a young drummer, which<br />\nseems good enough excuse for his lengthy solos consisting<br />\nalmost entirely of Buddy Rich/Gene K rupa cliches. He<br />\ngets two fifteen minute solos, which most of the crowd<br /><br />\nlove. In short, he's fast, flashy and fun, which, you guess,<br />\nmakes up for his lack of ideas.<br />\nJ ohnny Orr fools you.. Unlike Graham, whose flurry of<br />\nnotes seem to hide a lack of quality, Orr's basswork seems<br />\nalmost reticent, as if he were afraid to say something.<br />\nUntil he solos. Small children are often told to merely<br />\nspeak when spoken to, and when Or finally speaks, it's<br />\ngenius. Brilliant runs, flawless double-stops, and an<br />\nexquisite melodic sense combine for solos which carry the<br />\nquiet brilliance of a Picasso drawing.<br />\n\"Nobody's backing the young man who decides to<br />\nkeep J azz going as a cultural art... You've got young<br />\npeople coming out of the schools today that are great<br />\nmusicians, but where are they going? Nobody's making<br />\nany openings, nobody.\"<br />\nIt would be easy to dismiss Hines as just another old<br />\nmusician who regrets passing of<br />\nhis time, until you learn about his non-musical life. For<br />\nexample, that he is currently the President of the Overseas<br />\nPress Club. That he speaks frequently with the State<br />\nDepartment's Arts Programs Co-Ordinators. That, while<br />\nplaying at a reception or Gerald Ford and Valery<br />\nGiscard D'Estaing, he spoke to the President about the<br />\nimportance of government involvement in the Arts.<br />\nHe thinks that there should be a Secretary for the Arts;<br />\n\"I've been fighting for that for years, and, God bless the<br />\ndead, Ellington too... But we're just a couple of people...\"<br />\nHe intends to speak to President Carter when he plays for<br />\nhim, but is worried because he is unsure where Carter<br />\nstands.<br />\nBut it is with the young, Hines feels, the answer lies.<br />\n\"There's not a kid you know that's not interested in Bugs<br />\nBunny. So why not open up an avenue for music?\"<br />\nGetting the message across, that music is something<br />\nvaluable in itself--that's what is needed.\"The trouble with<br />\nthe United States is they're commercial...They're trying<br />\nto put music, as far as success is concerned, in the<br />\ncategory of sports.\"<br />\n\"The only hope I see for any young musician is learn<br />\nyour horn.' Learn your instrument. Don't pick it up by<br />\near. Years ago, when we had the big bands, you had to<br />\nknow what to do to be in the band... We went down to<br />\nrecord because we wanted to hear ourselves, perfect<br />\nourselves...\" The drive for excellence, for music for its<br />\nown sake seems all that is needed to make the world run<br />\nsmoothly.<br />\nIt also seems very dry. Dry, until you think back to<br />\nMarva Josie, the band's vocalist, swinging through Jelly,<br />\nJelly in a down home, no holds barred performance, that<br />\nwould have Dinah Washington blushing with envy.

The<br />\ndignified desperation of the other novels has<br />\nbecome savage outrage. The subtle paring-knife<br />\nhumor has become a guillotine. And we are the<br />\npotential victims.<br />\nA fallen Southern gentleman and souring liberal<br />\nlawyer, Lance is stagnating in a modern age which<br />\naffords him neither direction nor identity. He is<br />\nthe \"Knight of the Unholy Grail,\" fading into<br />\nnon-existence, when suddenly the discovery of his<br />\nwife's infidelity leads him to a critical revelation :<br />\nthat there is a here and now, that it is intolerable,<br />\nand that he can do something about it. The actions<br />\nLance undertakes, and the plans he evolves for a<br />\nNew World, are based upon the \"Great Secret of<br />\nLife 'as he discerns it: 'God's secret design for<br />\nman is that man's happiness lies for men in men<br />\npracticing violence upon women and that women's<br />\nhappiness lies in submitting to it. The secret of life<br />\nis violence and rape.\"<br />\nYou may disagree with Ithat, perhaps violently.<br />\nIt is difficult, in any case, not to concur with<br />\nLance's (Percy's?) grim diagnosis of modern<br />\nAmerican life, especially his bleakly accurate<br />\ndepiction 'of our sexual maladies. The picture is<br />\nshocking, sobering\u20141 intolerable, Lance would say.<br />\nIf the present is intolerable, the past is even<br />\nmore so. Like many of us, Lance turns to the past<br />\nseeking a reaffirmation of the validity and<br />\ninevitability of his present condition: things just<br />\nhave to be this way. But the past only reveals<br />\nroads not taken, false triumphs, fragments shored<br />\nagainst his ruins. The present receives neither<br /><br />\njustification nor clarification from the past. For<br />\nLance, \"the mystery lies in the here and now,\"<br />\nand it grows ever more mysterious as one comes to<br />\nrecognize the overwhelming magnitude of that<br />\ncentral question : \"What is one to do with<br />\noneself?\" \\It may be the case that what Lance<br />\ndoes is in fact his undoing.<br />\nLance's story oscillates between a dark perverse<br />\ndespair and a strange frenzied hope. Reading it is<br />\nlike taking a wild roller coaster ride. As much as<br />\nyou might want to, you can't get off. And in the<br />\nend, you're left both exhausted and exhilarated,<br />\n\u2022and perhaps a bit weak in the knees. That is<br />\nunderstandable. For, if nothing else, the visions of<br />\nLancelot will shake you. Maybe even scare the hell<br />\nout of you.<br />\nSuperfolks by Robert Mayer. (231 pp.; The Dial<br />\nPress. $3.95 in quality paperback format, $8.95 ill<br />\nhardcover.)<br />\nBy GARY SMITH<br />\n\"There were no more heroes.\"<br />\nSo opens \"Superfolks,\" Robert Mayer's comic<br />\nbook in novel form. His first published novel, it is<br />\na funny and often irreverent fiction, written for<br />\nadults who grew up hiding Dell comics in their<br />\ngeography text books, about the one superhero<br />\nleft, the greatest superhero of them all.<br />\nWho might this paragon of power be? Not<br />\nBatman and/or Robin. They were killed in a<br />\ntraffic smash-up. Superman? He's missing,<br />\npresumed dead, after a K ryptonite meteor<br />\nslammed into Metropolis. Wonder Woman? She's<br />\n,voluntarily given up her powers and become a<br />\nspokesperson for Women's Lib. The Lone Ranger<br />\ncaught an arrow in the back, and Tonto ran off to<br />\nWounded iKnee. Which leaves...<br />\n...A creation of Mayer's fertile imagination, one<br />\nvery close to Superman and going by the name of<br />\nDavid Brinkley. In any case, that's his civilian<br />\nname. He was sent to Earth as an infant from the<br />\nplanet Cronk, left a flourishing career as an ace<br />\nyoung reporter at a great metropolitan newspaper<br />\nfor broadcasting, but missed the smell of printer's<br />\nink. Now he's Oven up the airwaves, in both<br />\nsenses, and has his feet tied securely to the copy<br />\ndesk of his old newspaper. He's 42, married, the<br />\nfather of two children, has a nice wife and blue<br />\nhair. He's vulnerable to only one substance:<br />\nCronkite \u2014and perhaps the ravages of time,<br />\nbecause, after eight years of retirement, his<br />\nsuper-powers are definitely on the wane.<br />\nHe has had attacks of weakness and has lost<br />\nconfidence in himself\u2014as well as in the general<br />\norder. What could any superhero do faced with<br />\npolitical assassinations, racial disturbances,<br />\nVietnam and rampant street crime? The world has<br />\ncome of age and the problems seem<br />\ninsurmountable.<br />\nThat is how Brinkley feels until a fateful news<br />\nflash draws him unexpectedly out of his suburban<br />\nshell and back into the real world of crime and<br />\nviolence. But he has been devitalized so much that<br />\nhe crashes into atree in hisfirst attempt to leap tall<br />\nbuildings. Is there a criminal mastermind, and a<br />\nfoul plot to dispose of the last of the superheroes?<br />\nThe plot thickens...<br />\n\"Superfolks\" is a good, old-fashioned<br />\nmis-adventure story made contemporary by liberal<br />\ndoses of political intrigue, sex and some hilarious<br />\nexamples of celebrity malapropisms. Mayer<br />\nhandles it all with grace and ease.<br />\nAnd well he might. First novel or not, his name<br />\nought to have a familiar ring to it. For 10 years he<br />\nwas reporter and later a columnist for Newsday, a<br />\ngreat metropolitan newspaper. While he was there<br />\nhe won numerous awards for writing excellence,<br />\nincluding a National Headliners' Club award.<br />\nMayer seems to have kept his foot on the<br />\naccelerator the whole time in the story. It has a<br />\nsparkling beginning, just the slightest trace of<br />\nmiddle-pages spread and a clever end. The work is<br />\na whole, and a whole lot of fun, due to the<br />\nauthor's skill and imagination. I His gibes at the<br />\nnews industry and other writers have punch and<br />\nstyle, especially the parody on Norman Mailer's highly personal and often excessive style of<br />\nreportage.<br />\n\"Superfolks\" is the kind of book that could give<br />\nlightweight fiction a good name. It is some of the<br />\nbest of recent efforts at the genre, written to<br />\nentertain. Give it a read.

'A<br /><br />\nIA VNION<br /><br />\notsave<br /><br />\n6$<br /><br />\nMaking the Fair<br />\nSafe for violence<br />\nBy ERIC GARLAND<br />\nThis year's Spring Fair didn't seem to bring as many<br />\npeople to Hopkins as in the past; it also escaped a rainy<br />\nwashout for three straight days. What the Mardi Gras did<br />\nget, however, was a mixture of violence and police<br />\nactivity that, in retrospect, has been unusually absent<br />\nfrom past fairs.<br />\nNMth anywhere from ten to forty thousand people on<br />\ncampus for a day, drinking beer and smoking dope, taking<br />\nninety-degree heat and waiting in long lines, it should be<br />\nexpected that a few among the crowd will get punchy-by<br />\nlate afternoon. Especially those few that happen to be<br />\nragged local punks or overeager lacrosse players\u2014it<br />\ndoesn't take too many Schlitz lights or poorly-chosen<br />\nwords to bring out the worst in people.<br />\nThe knifing incidents in the freshman quad are general<br />\nknowledge: one Hopkins student slashed and a teenager<br />\ncut in a back-and-forth brawl around the ride area. Along<br />\nwith this well-known melee, there were a number of<br />\nminor scuffles. One in particular took place about a<br />\nhalf-hour before the stabbings, precipitated by the same<br />\ngroup responsible for the later scuffles.<br />\nCharacterizing the Friday night fight was a uniform<br />\nlack of sensible action by the campus police. Those<br />\non-hand for the entire affair, and others involved in<br />\nisolated fistfights, had common complaints about the<br />\nfumblings of the blue-uniformed security force. After the<br />\ninitial outburst in the freshman quad\u2014rather serious with<br />\none man ganged up on by local youths\u2014the campus cops<br />\nfailed to respond to repeated warnings and identifications<br />\nof the troublemakers. Instead, they waited for the arrival<br />\nof city police, making no attempts at crowd control and<br />\nstaying clear of those pointed out as brawlers, the ones<br />\nwho would later start the knife fights. \"The cops were<br />\nIntimidated more. than anything, just scared,\" said one<br />\nobFrvor.<br /><br />\nor-<br /><br />\n%en the city police got to the freshmen quad they<br />\nreceived little help from campus security in the way of<br />\nrounding up the instigators. Outside of the people stabbed<br />\nor those who actually fought with the city police, the<br />\noriginal gang that had been repeatedly identified to the<br />\ncampus police was relatively ignored (in fact, they<br />\nreappeared Sunday at the Fair, ready for more<br />\nencounters.)<br />\nOnce the city police cleared the amusement area in the<br />\nfreshman quad, they toliped.off a confused evening by<br />\nproceeding to the Gilman Quad, where a jazz band had<br />\nbeen scheduled for a 9:30 show. The band had moved<br />\nindoors to the Glass Pavilion, apparently for fear of rain. \u2022<br />\nUnfortunately, there was little notice given to those<br /><br />\nmilling about the Quad, wondering what had become of<br />\nthe performance. The police then came into the Quad,<br />\nsaw the crowd of people that seemed to be loitering for<br />\nno reason, and with the ride-area hubbub fresh in their<br />\nminds, went about kicking everyone out of the area.<br />\nNumerous complaints were voiced about the over-reaction<br />\nof the police, of excessive hassling of those that happened<br />\nto have a plastic beer cup in hand.<br />\nThus the Mardi Gras, with its theme of insanity amid<br />\nrevelry, had an offshoot of violence that was grossly<br />\nmishandled at the start, and then typically over-reacted to<br />\nat the end. Next year's Fair will have that to go on.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 41221, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "070080bc-4c03-44ff-bad1-6e855e747af7", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14356-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14356, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "2875bf01-ff0f-4532-a037-07ef52929f11", "url": "/node/14356"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "4b95e323-3e9c-4d81-9873-74b9b4b26a3d"}]}
