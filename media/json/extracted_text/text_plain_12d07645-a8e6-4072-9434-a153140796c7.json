All the<br />\nspeeches were decidedly optimistic<br />\nand the large number of candidates<br />\npresent manifested a lively interest<br />\nin everything that was said.<br />\nCaptain John G. Huck presided.<br />\nHe first called on Reaney Wolfe,<br />\nwho was recently elected head coach<br />\nof this year's twelve. Coach Wolfe<br />\nmade a brief but pointed speech and<br />\nemphasized the fact that all the positions on the teams were open and<br />\nwould be filled only by the candidates who make the best showing<br />\nduring the next two months, regardless of the fact that thirteen<br />\n\"H\" men are trying for the team.<br />\nG. Pitts Raleigh, B. . S., head<br />\ncoach of the 1911 championship<br />\ntwelve and one of the present lacrosse advisers, entertained all present with a most rhetorical and oratorical effusion which sparkled with<br />\nwit and humor. Assuming melodramatic pose he thundered, \"Do<br />\nmy Apollo-like knees beneath me<br />\nquake? Does my heart within me<br />\nshiver and shake? Does my Herculean breast palpitate because the<br />\nsporting editor of the Evening Sun<br />\nhas dared to accuse me of being<br />\nthe guy who put my foot in the<br />\nfotball team? No! Again, most<br />\nemphatically, no!\" The great orator then proceeded to unfold the<br />\nglorious future that awaits the 1913<br />\nHopkins lacrosse team. His matchless eloquence was at its best. He<br />\nso far surpassed all his famous previous efforts that the writer finds<br />\nit impossible to render him full justice. Suffice it to say he painted the<br />\nfuture of the lacrosse team in tones<br />\nso dazzling as to cause the pallescent tints of heaven's blue vault or<br />\nthe half-revealed colors of fading<br />\nrainbows to seem the work of a<br />\nmere tyro.<br />\n\"Father Bill\" Schmeisser, Dr. Roland T. Abercrombie, Eddie Hulbert and Bob Lowndes each made a<br />\nshort address before the meeting<br />\nwas over. All the candidates present were signed up as members of<br />\nthe squad.<br />\nManager Howell has completed<br />\nhis lacrosse schedule. All the<br />\ngames are expected to be played on<br />\nthe following dates, although several of the contracts have not<br />\nbeen signed. The schedule follows:<br />\nMarch 29, Johns Hopkins Alumni<br />\nat Homewood; April 5, Cornell at<br />\n<br />\nThere will be a \"Hopkins Night\"<br />\nperformance at Ford's Theatre tomorrow night at one of the most<br />\nattractive productions that has appeared in Baltimore this year\u2014\"The<br />\nIsle 'o Dreams,\" with Chauncey 01cott. The play has an Irish scene,<br />\nand Mr. Olcott is, of course, the<br />\nstar, with his tenor voice which has<br />\nmade him one of the most popular players upon the American<br />\nstage. Rida Johnson Young is the<br />\nauthor. The action of the play<br />\ntakes place in 1799, at the ,time of<br />\nthe threatened invasion of England<br />\nand Ireland by Emperor Napoleon.<br />\nThe story involves the fortunes<br />\nof Ivor Kelway, whose role is taken<br />\nby Mr. Olcott, a castaway picked up<br />\noff the coast of the Isle 'o Dreams,<br />\na little island near the southern<br />\ncoast of Ireland. He is adopted by<br />\n'Al other Kelway, who keeps the<br />\ntavern, and grows up under her<br />\ncare to be a spirited and likely lad.<br />\nHe then falls in love with Kathleen,<br />\nthe (laughter of the rich and powerful O'Doons.<br />\nHe takes part in all the thrilling<br />\nadventures of the times, many of<br />\nthem for love's sake, and finally,<br />\nthrough a series of happenings, he<br />\nis discovered to be of a noble family<br />\nand heir to great wealth.<br />\nThe greatest attraction, to some<br />\nof the theatre-gbers at least, will<br />\nbe the number of songs, both old<br />\nand new, which are sung during<br />\nthe performance. There are four<br />\nnew songs which are most popular:<br />\n\"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,\"<br />\n'The Isle 'o Dreams,\" \"Kathleen<br />\nA'Roon\" and \"Mother Machree.\"<br />\nAll are sung by Mr. Olcott.<br />\nFor this play, special attention has been put upon the costuming and the scenery. The costumes<br />\nare most attractive and are all in<br />\nperfect keeping with the period,<br />\nwhile the scenery is said to be the<br />\nmost elaborate and beautiful that<br />\nhas ever been used for an Irish play<br />\nof this character.<br />\nA special musical program has<br />\nbeen arranged for the intermissions,<br />\nas follows:<br />\n<br />\n\"Ben dikkai<br />\nDeen dikka<br />\nFatta dikka foo<br />\nHopkins, Hopkins,<br />\nNineteen-two.\"<br />\n<br />\nIt was thus that Homewood received the stamp of approval of the<br />\nrepresentatives of the Class of 1902<br />\nat their decennial reunion on December 27, 1912. After enjoying<br />\nluncheon provided' by President<br />\n\"Billy\" Sneeringer at his home,<br />\n1317 North Charles street, the men<br />\nwere taken to Homewood and noted<br />\nwith enthusiasm the great strides<br />\nthat have already been made, especially in the athletic field.<br />\nThe Green Spring Valley Hunt<br />\nClub was next visited in order to<br />\narouse an appetite for the dinner at<br />\nthe University Club at 7 P. M.<br />\nJust, prior to the dinner an election of officers for the ensuing five<br />\nyears was held. Ogle Marbury was<br />\nunanimously elected president and<br />\nRalph C.

A poll of those present indicated a large number of<br />\nprospective Hopkins students.<br />\nThat the class still maintains its<br />\ninterest in college life is evidenced<br />\nby its representation on the lacrosse,<br />\nfootball and track committees of the<br />\ngraduate advisory committee. Ogle<br />\nMarbury's activities in the House of<br />\nDelegates on behalf of Hopkins in<br />\nits fight for a technical school were<br />\nwarmly commended. Contrary to<br />\nits custom of landing first in any<br />\ncompetitive effort, it took second<br />\nplace of all the classes of the University in the proportion of the<br />\nmembers who subscribed to the endowment fund; thus illustrating the<br />\ninterest of the class if not its opulence.<br />\nDr. Kirk was compelled to leave<br />\nbefore the dinner was over and<br />\n(Continued on page 2 col. 2.)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 2.)<br />\n<br />\n\u2022BEFORE ACT I.<br />\nI.

According to the<br />\nthen prevailing school fashion each<br />\ndesk held two boys. I shared a<br />\ndesk for most of the time with one<br />\nof Dr. Browne's sons, they then living at Charles and Twenty-fifth<br />\nstreets. My desk-mate showed me<br />\none of his exercises in Greek prose<br />\ncompbsition, with corrections in his<br />\nfather's handwriting. Boyishly, I<br />\ndeclared my Greek letters better<br />\nshaped than Dr. Browne's. The<br />\nnext day my desk-mate brought<br />\nwith him to school some carefully<br />\nwritten lines of Greek, one of the<br />\nmost beautiful specimens of calligraphy I have ever seen. About<br />\nthat time I was often at his house<br />\nwith my school-fellows and I remember ,him in the evenings, seated<br />\nin the parlor, undisturbed by our<br />\nchatter and noise, evenly at work<br />\non his translation of Von Falke's<br />\n\"Greece and Rome.\" This was published in 1881\u2014a large, handsome<br />\nillustrated gift book. That Christmas it was given me as a Christmas<br />\npresent. I read it greedily and<br />\nnoted on page 195, after several<br />\nmentions of Hannibal and of Alexander the Great, the misprint \"even<br />\nbefore Alexander's death\" for \"even<br />\nbefore Hannibal's death.\" I told<br />\nmy desk-mate and next day received<br />\na note of thanks, written gravely,<br />\nas to an equal.

By<br />\nadvertisement he secured for that<br />\nevening the use of a fine old colonial<br />\nhouse in the suburbs, well provided<br />\nwith large rooms and open log fireplaces.<br />\nA private car was provided to take<br />\ntwenty-five members of the class to<br />\nthe place of reunion. The house was<br />\nhandsomely decorated with holly;<br />\nthe banquet table and the electric<br />\nlights were harmoniously blended in<br />\na color scheme of red and the place<br />\ncards were tastefully adorned with<br />\ntbe University seal. The excellence<br />\nof the courses urged on the speakers of the evening, one of whom<br />\nwas Brooke Price, who had come<br />\nall the way from the Harvard Law<br />\nSchool in order to be present. Some<br />\ntime was consumed in the discussion of class plans and, among other<br />\nthings, it was voted that hereafter<br />\nreunions be held yearly, immediately<br />\nfollowing Commencement Day.<br />\nAfter the banquet a pleasant evening was spent close by the log-filled<br />\nfireplace, where the bearded graduates of '12 with memory and fancy<br />\ninterwoven told of things past,<br />\npresent and future.

D. Penniman<br />\nand Branham were the other nominees, but the vote was not close.<br />\nLiebensperger was the logical choice<br />\nfor the honor on account of his excellent work during the past two<br />\nyears.<br />\nSomehow or other, during his<br />\nfreshman year, Liebensperger did.<br />\nnot play football, and it was not<br />\nuntil the annual game between the<br />\nsophomores and freshmen that his<br />\nability became known. He was the<br />\nfreshman fullback in that memorable game when the first year men<br />\n'beat the sophomores who had a<br />\nteam of 'Varsity players. Liebensperger's line plunging in that game<br />\nwas its feature, and in the interclass<br />\ngame the next year Liebensperger<br />\nmade two of the four touchdowns<br />\nscored by the 1914 team.<br />\nAs a sophomore he was the regular left tackle and played every minute of the season save two, when he<br />\nwas removed from the Thanksgiving Day game to allow a substitute to go in. He repeated this feat<br />\nagain during the past season, only<br />\nthis time his shoulder was wrenched<br />\nin the last few minutes of play in<br />\nthe V. M. I. game.

Before another 365<br />\ndays have passed by, several of the<br />\nmain buildings should be nearing<br />\ncompletion, and the others will be<br />\ncommenced upon as soon as all<br />\nthe details are worked out by the<br />\ncommittees in charge.<br />\nAlthough the newly-established<br />\ntechnical school received first year<br />\nstudents last fall, because not much<br />\nchange was requirea from the regular freshman work for the bachelor's degree, yet 1913 will really<br />\nmark the\u2022 formal opening of the<br />\ntechnical school as a distinctive department of the University. In all<br />\nprobability the faculty of the technical school will be definitely decided<br />\nupon in a ,short time. It would, of<br />\ncourse, be too much to expect the<br />\nsame degree of perfection at once<br />\nin the technical school as. obtains<br />\nat present in the other University<br />\ndepartments, but it is hoped that<br />\nit will not be long before the technical school takes the same high rank<br />\nin its field that the other departments hold in theirs.<br />\nNineteen-thirteen will be an auspicious year for Hopkins because it<br />\nwill mark the inauguration of<br />\nWoodrow Wilson, Johns Hopkins'<br />\nfirst alumnus to be elected to the<br />\npresidency of the United States.<br />\nMay his administration be so emi.nently successful that Johns Hop-<br />\n<br />\nNineteen-thirteen gives every indication of being one of the best years<br />\nfrom an all-around sporting viewpoint that Johns Hopkins has ever<br />\nhad. The Black and Blue lacrosse<br />\nteam seems to be slated for another<br />\nchampionship, and the lacrosse<br />\nschedule is the best that has been<br />\narranged for a number of years.<br />\nHopkins will play every team in<br />\nboth divisions of the Intercollegiate<br />\nLacrosse League, and also the Navy<br />\nand Carlisle Indian twelves. All<br />\nbut one of last year's baseball players are back at the University, and<br />\nthere are a number of new candidates in the freshman class. Last<br />\nyear's nine made a splendid record<br />\nand this year's team is expected to<br />\ndo even better. The track team<br />\nwill have a hard task excelling last<br />\nyear's team, but the veterans and<br />\nnew candidates are very optimistic<br />\nand are working hard. There is<br />\ncertain to be a decided improvement<br />\nin football. The beneficial results<br />\nof the new system inaugurated last<br />\nyear should begin to materialize<br />\nnext fall. Hopkins will be represented by a basket ball team for the<br />\nfirst time in the history of the University, and the initial game will be<br />\nplayed early this month.

I suggest that the Cotillon<br />\nBoard look into this matter. I, personally, do not see why the gentlemen must check their wraps. Why<br />\ncan't the gentlemen have a room to<br />\nthemselves as the ladies have? Then<br />\nwe could take off our wraps, place<br />\nthem on chairs and have no trouble<br />\nor confusion in procuring them<br />\nafter the dance. In this way we<br />\ncould get our wraps and be ready<br />\n.to escort our ladies home, instead<br />\nof having them wait a half hour or<br />\nmore for us impolite escorts. I<br />\nhave even noticed some of the ladies<br />\ntaking the wraps of their escorts<br />\ninto the ladies' room, because they<br />\nwere afraid that, owing to the confusion at the men's room, they<br />\nmight miss the last car home.<br />\nSurely the present checking system<br />\nis not used for fear that one boy<br />\nmight steal the coat of another.<br />\nSurely a boy who can and is willing to pay to attend the dances does<br />\n<br />\nnot wish to steal. a coat. If the<br />\nladies can be trusted, why can't their<br />\nescorts, the students themselves, be<br />\ntrusted? If the checking system is<br />\na money-making scheme for the<br />\njanitors, let the Cotillon Board give<br />\neach janitor seventy-five cents to<br />\nkeep a watchful eye over the boys'<br />\nwraps.

All the<br />\nspeeches were decidedly optimistic<br />\nand the large number of candidates<br />\npresent manifested a lively interest<br />\nin everything that was said.<br />\nCaptain John G. Huck presided.<br />\nHe first called on Reaney Wolfe,<br />\nwho was recently elected head coach<br />\nof this year's twelve. Coach Wolfe<br />\nmade a brief but pointed speech and<br />\nemphasized the fact that all the positions on the teams were open and<br />\nwould be filled only by the candidates who make the best showing<br />\nduring the next two months, regardless of the fact that thirteen<br />\n\"H\" men are trying for the team.<br />\nG. Pitts Raleigh, B. . S., head<br />\ncoach of the 1911 championship<br />\ntwelve and one of the present lacrosse advisers, entertained all present with a most rhetorical and oratorical effusion which sparkled with<br />\nwit and humor. Assuming melodramatic pose he thundered, \"Do<br />\nmy Apollo-like knees beneath me<br />\nquake? Does my heart within me<br />\nshiver and shake? Does my Herculean breast palpitate because the<br />\nsporting editor of the Evening Sun<br />\nhas dared to accuse me of being<br />\nthe guy who put my foot in the<br />\nfotball team? No! Again, most<br />\nemphatically, no!\" The great orator then proceeded to unfold the<br />\nglorious future that awaits the 1913<br />\nHopkins lacrosse team. His matchless eloquence was at its best. He<br />\nso far surpassed all his famous previous efforts that the writer finds<br />\nit impossible to render him full justice. Suffice it to say he painted the<br />\nfuture of the lacrosse team in tones<br />\nso dazzling as to cause the pallescent tints of heaven's blue vault or<br />\nthe half-revealed colors of fading<br />\nrainbows to seem the work of a<br />\nmere tyro.<br />\n\"Father Bill\" Schmeisser, Dr. Roland T.

All the<br />\ngames are expected to be played on<br />\nthe following dates, although several of the contracts have not<br />\nbeen signed. The schedule follows:<br />\nMarch 29, Johns Hopkins Alumni<br />\nat Homewood; April 5, Cornell at<br /><br />\nThere will be a \"Hopkins Night\"<br />\nperformance at Ford's Theatre tomorrow night at one of the most<br />\nattractive productions that has appeared in Baltimore this year\u2014\"The<br />\nIsle 'o Dreams,\" with Chauncey 01cott. The play has an Irish scene,<br />\nand Mr. Olcott is, of course, the<br />\nstar, with his tenor voice which has<br />\nmade him one of the most popular players upon the American<br />\nstage. Rida Johnson Young is the<br />\nauthor. The action of the play<br />\ntakes place in 1799, at the ,time of<br />\nthe threatened invasion of England<br />\nand Ireland by Emperor Napoleon.<br />\nThe story involves the fortunes<br />\nof Ivor Kelway, whose role is taken<br />\nby Mr. Olcott, a castaway picked up<br />\noff the coast of the Isle 'o Dreams,<br />\na little island near the southern<br />\ncoast of Ireland. He is adopted by<br />\n'Al other Kelway, who keeps the<br />\ntavern, and grows up under her<br />\ncare to be a spirited and likely lad.<br />\nHe then falls in love with Kathleen,<br />\nthe (laughter of the rich and powerful O'Doons.<br />\nHe takes part in all the thrilling<br />\nadventures of the times, many of<br />\nthem for love's sake, and finally,<br />\nthrough a series of happenings, he<br />\nis discovered to be of a noble family<br />\nand heir to great wealth.<br />\nThe greatest attraction, to some<br />\nof the theatre-gbers at least, will<br />\nbe the number of songs, both old<br />\nand new, which are sung during<br />\nthe performance. There are four<br />\nnew songs which are most popular:<br />\n\"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,\"<br />\n'The Isle 'o Dreams,\" \"Kathleen<br />\nA'Roon\" and \"Mother Machree.\"<br />\nAll are sung by Mr. Olcott.<br />\nFor this play, special attention has been put upon the costuming and the scenery. The costumes<br />\nare most attractive and are all in<br />\nperfect keeping with the period,<br />\nwhile the scenery is said to be the<br />\nmost elaborate and beautiful that<br />\nhas ever been used for an Irish play<br />\nof this character.<br />\nA special musical program has<br />\nbeen arranged for the intermissions,<br />\nas follows:<br /><br />\n\"Ben dikkai<br />\nDeen dikka<br />\nFatta dikka foo<br />\nHopkins, Hopkins,<br />\nNineteen-two.\"<br /><br />\nIt was thus that Homewood received the stamp of approval of the<br />\nrepresentatives of the Class of 1902<br />\nat their decennial reunion on December 27, 1912. After enjoying<br />\nluncheon provided' by President<br />\n\"Billy\" Sneeringer at his home,<br />\n1317 North Charles street, the men<br />\nwere taken to Homewood and noted<br />\nwith enthusiasm the great strides<br />\nthat have already been made, especially in the athletic field.<br />\nThe Green Spring Valley Hunt<br />\nClub was next visited in order to<br />\narouse an appetite for the dinner at<br />\nthe University Club at 7 P. M.<br />\nJust, prior to the dinner an election of officers for the ensuing five<br />\nyears was held. Ogle Marbury was<br />\nunanimously elected president and<br />\nRalph C.

A poll of those present indicated a large number of<br />\nprospective Hopkins students.<br />\nThat the class still maintains its<br />\ninterest in college life is evidenced<br />\nby its representation on the lacrosse,<br />\nfootball and track committees of the<br />\ngraduate advisory committee. Ogle<br />\nMarbury's activities in the House of<br />\nDelegates on behalf of Hopkins in<br />\nits fight for a technical school were<br />\nwarmly commended. Contrary to<br />\nits custom of landing first in any<br />\ncompetitive effort, it took second<br />\nplace of all the classes of the University in the proportion of the<br />\nmembers who subscribed to the endowment fund; thus illustrating the<br />\ninterest of the class if not its opulence.<br />\nDr. Kirk was compelled to leave<br />\nbefore the dinner was over and<br />\n(Continued on page 2 col. 2.)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 2.)<br /><br />\n\u2022BEFORE ACT I.<br />\nI.

According to the<br />\nthen prevailing school fashion each<br />\ndesk held two boys. I shared a<br />\ndesk for most of the time with one<br />\nof Dr. Browne's sons, they then living at Charles and Twenty-fifth<br />\nstreets. My desk-mate showed me<br />\none of his exercises in Greek prose<br />\ncompbsition, with corrections in his<br />\nfather's handwriting. Boyishly, I<br />\ndeclared my Greek letters better<br />\nshaped than Dr. Browne's. The<br />\nnext day my desk-mate brought<br />\nwith him to school some carefully<br />\nwritten lines of Greek, one of the<br />\nmost beautiful specimens of calligraphy I have ever seen. About<br />\nthat time I was often at his house<br />\nwith my school-fellows and I remember ,him in the evenings, seated<br />\nin the parlor, undisturbed by our<br />\nchatter and noise, evenly at work<br />\non his translation of Von Falke's<br />\n\"Greece and Rome.\" This was published in 1881\u2014a large, handsome<br />\nillustrated gift book. That Christmas it was given me as a Christmas<br />\npresent. I read it greedily and<br />\nnoted on page 195, after several<br />\nmentions of Hannibal and of Alexander the Great, the misprint \"even<br />\nbefore Alexander's death\" for \"even<br />\nbefore Hannibal's death.\" I told<br />\nmy desk-mate and next day received<br />\na note of thanks, written gravely,<br />\nas to an equal.

As it was felt that their<br />\nsenior year banquet had reached the<br />\nzenith of hotel banquets, President<br />\nDonald Belt spent much energy preparing a unique entertainment. By<br />\nadvertisement he secured for that<br />\nevening the use of a fine old colonial<br />\nhouse in the suburbs, well provided<br />\nwith large rooms and open log fireplaces.<br />\nA private car was provided to take<br />\ntwenty-five members of the class to<br />\nthe place of reunion. The house was<br />\nhandsomely decorated with holly;<br />\nthe banquet table and the electric<br />\nlights were harmoniously blended in<br />\na color scheme of red and the place<br />\ncards were tastefully adorned with<br />\ntbe University seal. The excellence<br />\nof the courses urged on the speakers of the evening, one of whom<br />\nwas Brooke Price, who had come<br />\nall the way from the Harvard Law<br />\nSchool in order to be present. Some<br />\ntime was consumed in the discussion of class plans and, among other<br />\nthings, it was voted that hereafter<br />\nreunions be held yearly, immediately<br />\nfollowing Commencement Day.<br />\nAfter the banquet a pleasant evening was spent close by the log-filled<br />\nfireplace, where the bearded graduates of '12 with memory and fancy<br />\ninterwoven told of things past,<br />\npresent and future. Alfred Hatch<br />\nspoke of the mysteries of insurance,<br />\nLindsay Rogers of newspaper<br />\n\"beats,\" and Belt and Price gave<br />\nhints on traveling abroad, in short,<br />\nthey all made merry until twelve<br />\no'clock.<br /><br />\nLIEBENSPERGER CAPTAIN<br />\nHeavy Tackle of Past Two Seasons to<br />\nLead Next Year's Football Team.<br /><br />\nAt the meeting of this year's<br />\n'Varsity football team on December<br />\n12, Raymond Liebensperger, '14,<br />\nwas elected captain. D. Penniman<br />\nand Branham were the other nominees, but the vote was not close.<br />\nLiebensperger was the logical choice<br />\nfor the honor on account of his excellent work during the past two<br />\nyears.<br />\nSomehow or other, during his<br />\nfreshman year, Liebensperger did.<br />\nnot play football, and it was not<br />\nuntil the annual game between the<br />\nsophomores and freshmen that his<br />\nability became known. He was the<br />\nfreshman fullback in that memorable game when the first year men<br />\n'beat the sophomores who had a<br />\nteam of 'Varsity players. Liebensperger's line plunging in that game<br />\nwas its feature, and in the interclass<br />\ngame the next year Liebensperger<br />\nmade two of the four touchdowns<br />\nscored by the 1914 team.<br />\nAs a sophomore he was the regular left tackle and played every minute of the season save two, when he<br />\nwas removed from the Thanksgiving Day game to allow a substitute to go in. He repeated this feat<br />\nagain during the past season, only<br />\nthis time his shoulder was wrenched<br />\nin the last few minutes of play in<br />\nthe V. M. I. game.

Before another 365<br />\ndays have passed by, several of the<br />\nmain buildings should be nearing<br />\ncompletion, and the others will be<br />\ncommenced upon as soon as all<br />\nthe details are worked out by the<br />\ncommittees in charge.<br />\nAlthough the newly-established<br />\ntechnical school received first year<br />\nstudents last fall, because not much<br />\nchange was requirea from the regular freshman work for the bachelor's degree, yet 1913 will really<br />\nmark the\u2022 formal opening of the<br />\ntechnical school as a distinctive department of the University. In all<br />\nprobability the faculty of the technical school will be definitely decided<br />\nupon in a ,short time. It would, of<br />\ncourse, be too much to expect the<br />\nsame degree of perfection at once<br />\nin the technical school as. obtains<br />\nat present in the other University<br />\ndepartments, but it is hoped that<br />\nit will not be long before the technical school takes the same high rank<br />\nin its field that the other departments hold in theirs.<br />\nNineteen-thirteen will be an auspicious year for Hopkins because it<br />\nwill mark the inauguration of<br />\nWoodrow Wilson, Johns Hopkins'<br />\nfirst alumnus to be elected to the<br />\npresidency of the United States.<br />\nMay his administration be so emi.nently successful that Johns Hop-<br /><br />\nNineteen-thirteen gives every indication of being one of the best years<br />\nfrom an all-around sporting viewpoint that Johns Hopkins has ever<br />\nhad. The Black and Blue lacrosse<br />\nteam seems to be slated for another<br />\nchampionship, and the lacrosse<br />\nschedule is the best that has been<br />\narranged for a number of years.<br />\nHopkins will play every team in<br />\nboth divisions of the Intercollegiate<br />\nLacrosse League, and also the Navy<br />\nand Carlisle Indian twelves. All<br />\nbut one of last year's baseball players are back at the University, and<br />\nthere are a number of new candidates in the freshman class. Last<br />\nyear's nine made a splendid record<br />\nand this year's team is expected to<br />\ndo even better. The track team<br />\nwill have a hard task excelling last<br />\nyear's team, but the veterans and<br />\nnew candidates are very optimistic<br />\nand are working hard. There is<br />\ncertain to be a decided improvement<br />\nin football. The beneficial results<br />\nof the new system inaugurated last<br />\nyear should begin to materialize<br />\nnext fall. Hopkins will be represented by a basket ball team for the<br />\nfirst time in the history of the University, and the initial game will be<br />\nplayed early this month. Another<br />\ntennis team will be organized,.and<br />\nthe tennis players expect to duplicate the successful record of the<br />\ntennis team last spring.<br /><br />\n.

I suggest that the Cotillon<br />\nBoard look into this matter. I, personally, do not see why the gentlemen must check their wraps. Why<br />\ncan't the gentlemen have a room to<br />\nthemselves as the ladies have? Then<br />\nwe could take off our wraps, place<br />\nthem on chairs and have no trouble<br />\nor confusion in procuring them<br />\nafter the dance. In this way we<br />\ncould get our wraps and be ready<br />\n.to escort our ladies home, instead<br />\nof having them wait a half hour or<br />\nmore for us impolite escorts.

If the checking system is<br />\na money-making scheme for the<br />\njanitors, let the Cotillon Board give<br />\neach janitor seventy-five cents to<br />\nkeep a watchful eye over the boys'<br />\nwraps.
