Meanwhile, Dean of Students Jakie<br />\nHall is considering a recent Student Council proposal for<br />\nincreased undergraduate housing.<br />\nA spokesman for Hall said that to her knowledge the<br />\ndean has not yet reached a conclusion.<br />\nIn essence, the report submitted by the Council<br />\nHousing Committee calls for a greater amount of..<br />\nuniversity-owned housing allocated to undergraduates.<br />\nJohn Alexander, who prepared the report, said, \"I'm not<br />\nsuggesting that graduate students be excluded. I just want<br />\nto get the proportions right.\"<br />\nCurrently, 65% of the undergraudate population and<br />\n35% of the graduate population occupy university-owned<br />\nhousing. Excluding the freshmen who live in the<br />\ndormitories, the rate of undergraduates with university<br />\nhousing drops to less than 20%. The thrust of the report<br />\n<br />\nNN<br />\n<br />\nconcerns the other 80% of the undergraduates.<br />\nThe report argues that the university's housing policies<br />\nare illogical. The university assumes full responsibility for<br />\nthe freshmen as the youngest and least experienced<br />\nstudents, yet it takes a higher level of responsibility for<br />\nhousing older, more experienced graduate students than it<br />\ndoes for undergraduate upperclassmen, the report states,<br />\n\"In principle, this should be the other way around.\"<br />\nDiscrimination on the part of community landlords<br />\nfurther complicates undergraduates' problems.<br />\nApproximately<br />\none-third- of the housing notice's received by the<br />\nOff-Campus Housing Office specify that only graduate<br />\nstudents are acceptable tenants. Barred from several area<br />\nhousing units, but lacking transportation to move outside<br />\nthe vicinity of campus, the undergraduates often must<br />\ntake sub-standard lodgings at inflated prices.<br />\nThe Student Council's advocacy of \"a greater share, in<br />\nproportion to their population of the university-owned<br />\n<br />\nhousing, than the share allocated to graduates,\" is,<br />\naccording to Alexander, \"not a question of wants, but of<br />\nneeds and of satisfying needs. It's a question of scarcity,<br />\nso obviously not all needs will be satisfied, but in the way<br />\nthe scarcity if allocated, it should be more rational.\"<br />\nIn view of the graduate students' greater suitability to<br />\noff-campus housing, the Student Council has called for \"a<br />\nlong-term transition from the current situation to a more<br />\nequitable one.\" Suggestions have included a university<br />\nguarantee to house every first-year graduate and every<br />\nfirst-year undergraduate, with the remainder of the<br />\nstudents participating in the lottery. It has also been<br />\nsuggested that both undergraduates and graduates be<br />\nassigned housing through the lottery system.<br />\nPresently, the university assigns its undergraduate<br />\nhousing facilities by a lottery during spring semester for<br />\nthe next academic year. Graduate units are assigned on a<br />\nfirst-come, first-served basis.<br />\nUndergraduate and graduate housing arrangements also<br />\ndiffer in their contracts. Undergraduates have time<br />\ncontracts which cover the duration of the academic year,<br />\nI! while graduates have full-year contracts. Therefore, if the<br />\nuniversity decides to increase its number of undergraduate<br />\ntenants, it will lose a substantial amount of money.<br />\nIn commenting on the Student Council report, Larry<br />\nFrelow of the Off-Campus Housing Office said, \"If we<br />\nwere going to house everyone on campus, we'd have to go<br />\nto mandatory housing, and I don't think tile students<br />\nwant that.\"<br />\nHowever, Alexander said, \"There is a notion on the<br />\npart of the administration that a lot of people don't want<br />\nanything to do with university housing, that a lot of<br />\npeople want to go off campus. I think this is out of touch<br />\nwith reality.\" He cited the large attendance at last week's<br />\nlottery information session as evidence of student<br />\ninterest.<br />\nThe university owns seven off-campus apartment<br />\nbuildings. Three of these\u2014Homewood, the Baltimorean,<br />\nand Bradford--are inhabited by graduate students and<br />\naccount for a total of 351 spaces. Another three<br />\nbuildings\u2014Wolman, Rogers, and Wyman Park\u2014are<br />\noccupied by undergraduates and have 243 spaces. The<br />\nseventh building, McCoy, which houses both graduates<br />\nand undergraduates, has 208 spaces. According to Student<br />\nCouncil figures, this puts the maximum capacity for<br />\nhousing graduates at 498, whereas that for non-freshman<br />\nundergraduates is only 313.<br />\nThe fate of their future allotment has not yet been<br />\ndecided. According to Alexander, \"As far as we (the<br />\nStudent Council) are concerned, the first step is for tile<br />\nuniversity to commit itself in principle.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/news-letter/march 8,1977<br />\n<br />\nThe complete campus<br />\nnotes from the tues. staff<br />\nThe JHU New Political Caucus is<br />\nsponsoring a film series about people's<br />\nliberation struggles this weekend<br />\ncalled \"Enemies of the People.\"<br />\nThursday, March 10\u2014Hearts and<br />\nMinds.

Many, inside and outside of<br />\nthe government, are attempting to forge a<br />\nnew political philosophy, a new strategy<br />\nof stabilization to accomodate the<br />\neconomic and political facts of life.<br />\nCarter's National Security Chief Zbigniew<br />\nBrzezinski calls this condition \"America<br />\nin a Hostile World.\"<br />\nDuring the primaries, Carter<br />\ncampaigned as an \"outsider,\" a politician<br />\nremoved from, the Washington scene. He<br />\nwas perceived as an adversary of the<br />\n\"Eastern Establishment\" who have<br />\nconferred a continuous bipartisan foreign<br />\nPolicy, regardless of what party happens<br />\nto be in office. David Halberstam<br />\nPortrayed these \"experts\" responsible for<br />\nVietnam as \"the best and the brightest.\"<br />\nIn the presidential campaign, Jimmy \"I'll<br />\nnever tell a lie\" Carter intentionally gave<br />\nthe impression there would be a clean<br />\nsweep of such types and promised \"a new<br />\ngeneration of leaders.\"<br />\nThus, the unsuspecting Carter voter<br />\ncast his ballot with the belief his<br />\ncandidate meant what he said ,and said<br />\nwhat he meant. To the more naive<br />\nsupporters of this \"populist\", the election<br />\nwas viewed as a contest between<br />\ngovernment by elite and government by<br />\nthe people.<br />\nBefore the Cabinet appointments were<br />\nmade, Hamilton Jordan, director of the<br />\nCarter campaign, confidently stated \"If<br />\nafter the inauguration, you find -a Cy<br />\nVance as Secretary' of State and a<br />\nZbigniew Brzezinski as head of National<br />\nSecurity, then I would say we failed. And<br />\nI'd quit. You're going to see new faces,<br />\nnew ideas. The government is going to be<br />\nrun by people you have never heard of.\"<br />\nSoon, Carter selected a Cabinet filled<br />\nwith what a writer for the San Francisco<br />\nExaminer has labelled a \"true elite,<br />\ncomprised of what many have called<br />\nAmerica's 'shadow government.' They<br />\nmove easily in and out of high positions<br />\nin the private 'sector and government<br />\nthrough a network of school , club, and<br />\nbusiness associations.\" What is most<br />\nstriking about the Carter appointments is<br />\nnot that their previous service in<br />\ngovernment or even their lengthy<br />\ncorporate ties but that, at last count,<br />\nDean of Students Jakie Hall's response<br />\nto the Student Council proposals<br />\nconcerning Follett's bookstore has gone<br />\nfrom initial enthusiasm to a dull hurrah.<br />\nThe time between Hall's initial pormises<br />\nand subsequent action has lengthened<br />\nin determindly. According to Sheldon<br />\nHimelfarb, head of the Bookstore<br />\nTaskforce, \"action was promised two<br />\nmonths ago and no one has done<br />\nanything yet.\" This, he said, was \"very<br />\nindicative of the way it's been in the<br />\npast.\"<br />\nAccording to Hall, who is responsible<br />\nfor making the final decision on Follett's<br />\nfuture, the issues presented by the<br />\nBookstore Taskforce are currently being<br />\nlooked into. Hall says he will be visiting<br />\nHarvard University to discuss their co-op<br />\norganization. Hall also says he has spoken<br />\nwith Follett's manager and district<br />\nmanager 'in an effort to \"strengthen<br />\ncommunications\" over such things as<br />\ndelays in ordering and receiving<br />\ntextbooks. Other meetings are being<br />\nscheduled' and Hall says that \"something<br />\nshould already be taking place.\" Hall says<br />\ne will make a final decision before<br />\n<br />\nsixteen high posts are held by members of<br />\na private organization called the<br />\n\"Trilateral Commission\" whose North<br />\nAmerican membership is approximately<br />\nseventy.<br />\nIn 1972, Chase Manhatten Bank<br />\nPresident David Rockefeller, organizer of<br />\nthe group, selected Carter a founding<br />\nmember. The President admits he<br />\n\"received basic foreign policy education<br />\nunder its auspices.\" Francois Sauzey,<br />\nproject director, recalls when Carter<br />\nannounced his candidacy, most fellow<br />\nmembers considered it a \"joke,\" but<br />\nBrzezinski saw Carter's potential and<br />\n<br />\nAccording to David Rockefeller, the<br />\npurpose of the organization is \"to bring<br />\nthe best brains in the world to bear on<br />\nthe problems of the future.\"<br />\nThe North-American membership list is<br />\ntop heavy with multi-national executives,<br />\nbanking figures, academics, and public<br />\nofficials. Its members consider themselves<br />\n\"liberal internationalists\" and their policy<br />\nproposals \"innovative.\" However,<br />\nconspiracy theorists ranging from the<br />\nJohn Birch Society to the U.S. Labor<br />\nParty have sensed sinister intentions and<br />\n-have attempted to expose efforts by the<br />\nRockefellers to establish a<br />\n<br />\napparently felt that he was an ideal<br />\npolitician to latch onto. Other members<br />\nof the select Commission, besides Carter<br />\nand Brzezinski, are Vice-President<br />\nMondale, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance,<br />\nSecretary of Defense Harold Brown,<br />\nSecretary of Treasury Michael<br />\nBlumenthal, and U.N. Ambassador<br />\nAndrew Young.<br />\nStyled as \"a private<br />\nNorth- American -European-Japanese<br />\nInitiative on Matters of Common<br />\nConcern,\" the commission was<br />\nestablished to foster a \"trialogue\" among<br />\nthe U.S. and her traditional allies.<br />\n<br />\nsupra-government. While the arguments<br />\nof these professional fanatics strain the<br />\nintellect, the fact remains that almost the<br />\nentire carter administration are, indeed,<br />\ntrilateral members. A more reasoned<br />\nanalysis is offered by William Greider in<br />\nThe Washington Post: \"It's Mem-kers are<br />\nnot drafting \u00a7ecret blueprints for ruling<br />\ntne world, but they are defining the<br />\nperceptions that may dominate U.S.<br />\nforeign policy in the next era.\" That era<br />\nhas arrived.<br />\nWriting in Foreign Policy, Brzezinski<br />\nstated the major problem: \"We are today<br />\nin the midst of a systematic crisis...The<br />\n<br />\nSpring Vacation.<br />\nHowever, according to Himelfarb, the<br />\naction taken thus far \"does not address<br />\nthe Taskforce's major concern over funds<br />\nleaving the campus which would mean<br />\nthe elimination of Follett's.\" The Follett<br />\nBookstore, which has a ten year contract,<br />\nrequires six months notice on any<br />\ndecision of change. This means that Hall<br />\nmust take action before the ends of the<br />\n<br />\ncould be kept within the University<br />\nrather than lost to a private enterprise. In<br />\naddition, inflated costs for the<br />\nbookstore's aeratio; could be reduced.<br />\nProvost Richard P. Longaker yesterday<br />\nemphasized the sincerity of \"assurances\"<br />\nmade by the administration on the<br />\nuncertain issue of calendar reform.<br />\n\"The reason the administration can't<br />\ngive guarantees is because the whole<br />\n<br />\nCampus shorts:<br />\nFollett's and calendar<br />\nmonth if anything is to gg into effect in<br />\ntime for fall semester. So far, Himelfarb<br />\nsays, Hall has just been \"avoiding the<br />\nissue.\"<br />\nBased on an initial survey of Follett's<br />\npresent function, the Student Council<br />\nBookstore Taskforce maintains there<br />\nwould be substantial benefits to students<br />\nand the University if the University took<br />\nover. Profits made by the bookstore<br />\n<br />\nin at ter is still under discussion<br />\nthroughout the university. In way of<br />\nassurances, however, it should be noted<br />\nno significant opposition has turned up,<br />\nnor do I predict substantial opposition to<br />\noverride what we now assume will be the<br />\ncase. Exams will be before Christmas and<br />\nthere will be some form of intersession if<br />\nstudents and faculty wish.\"<br />\nThe Provost's statement echos a letter<br />\n<br />\ninternational system which emerged from<br />\nWorld War II is today open to challenge,<br />\nto many doubts, to many strains.\" For<br />\nmany foreign policy strategists, the<br />\nanswer to this crisis is the trilateral<br />\napproach of conciliation, rather thasi<br />\nconfrontation. Richard Ullman'has urged<br />\n\"a united front on the part of the<br />\nadvanced Western societies...to counter<br />\nthe new demands and militant action of,<br />\nthe Third World.\"<br />\nThis \"united we stand, divided we fall\"<br />\nphilosophy stems from the realization<br />\nthat America can no longer be the sole<br />\nleader of the world economic system;<br />\n\"cooperation\" is vital if the international<br />\nstatus quo is to be maintained. To do<br />\notherwise would lead to global anarchy.<br />\nThe Trilateralists believe the most serious<br />\nthreat to a stable world is the foreign<br />\nexchange crisis of the underdeveloped<br />\ncountries. These nations are unable to<br />\nrepay the bank loans needed to purchase<br />\nnecessary imports. The primary interest<br />\nof the Trilateral Commission in resolving<br />\nthis crisis is the restoration of a world<br />\neconomy conducive to trade and<br />\ninvestment. Thus, the commission has<br />\nproposed that further loans be extended<br />\nto these poor nations, so that imports<br />\nwould not be cut back with a resulting<br />\nworld depression.<br />\nIn the short run, such debt relief,<br />\nwhich the commission suggests, will<br />\nbolster a sagging world economic system.<br />\nHowever, many economists feel this will<br />\nnot solve the fundamental problem\u2014the<br />\ndependency of the poor nations on the<br />\nwealthy. According to Cheryl Payer, the<br />\nresult of borrowings by the less developed<br />\ncountries has amounted to a \"debt<br />\ntrap...an international system of debt<br />\npeonage,\" which dooms the financially<br />\naddicted country to perpetual<br />\nunderdevelopment. The commission is<br />\nsimply proposing yet another monetary<br />\n\"fix\" to perpetuate a cycle of<br />\ndependence which has benefitted the<br />\nindustrial countries at the expense of the<br />\npoor.<br />\nThe Trilateral approach appears to be<br />\none of management; it does not address<br />\nitself to -the structural inequality in the<br />\nworld today between the Northern<br />\ndeveloped countries and the Southern<br />\nunderdeveloped countries. The demands<br />\nof the latter for.a fair share of economic<br />\npower continue to go unheard. As this<br />\ninternational crisis builds, the<br />\nTrilateralists, in offering the few, concession they do, skirt the crucial<br />\nquestion of a just economic 0171,-.<br />\ntecently sent by President Steven Mulle<br />\nto Student Council President Steve<br />\nPonchak which says in part, \"It is my<br />\nintention to incorporate into the calendar<br />\nrevision the continued oppdrtunity for<br />\nHomewood undergraduates not enrolled<br />\nin interdivisional courses to take their<br />\nfinal examinations for the fall semester<br />\nbefore the Christmas/New Year's holiday<br />\nand the beginning for the second<br />\nsemester, whether the term intersession<br />\nremains or whether some other<br />\ndesignation is used for this period.\"<br />\nThe remaining stumbling block<br />\nbetween the conflicting parties is the<br />\nform of intersession; will it be credited or<br />\nnon-credited? \"There is no expectation at<br />\nthis point that credit will be granted, but<br />\nthere will be more discussion,\" the<br />\nProvost said, again not wishing to give the<br />\nstatement any finality.'Some faculty<br />\nmembers have criticized a credited<br />\nintersession because they \"doubt the<br />\nutility of a credited intersession and how<br />\ncredit is actually allotted,\" he said.

Without analyzing the<br />\ninvidious style of the editorial (Can a<br />\n`muldaneness\" (sic) indeed be<br />\n\"breathless\"?), I think that it is fair to<br />\nsay that the N-L, in failing to meet the<br />\nmost elemental standards of campus<br />\njournalism for approximatelY the past<br />\ntwo years, had abdicated any right to<br />\nproduce a piece such as this editorial.<br />\nSpecifically, there has not been a<br />\nNews-Letter at Hopkins since shortly<br />\nafter the days of Savitz' fiefdom. Over<br />\nthe past two years, the editors and staff<br />\nof the N-L have shown an increasing<br />\nfrequency to treat the reporting of<br />\ncampus news as a violation of the<br />\nSherman Anti-Trust Act. Not only does<br />\nthis editorial fail to have a news peg in<br />\nthis issue, but I don't even remember the<br />\nlast issue that had a story about the<br />\nactivities of the SC. When was the last<br />\ntime that a reporter covered the meetings<br />\non a regular basis.<br />\n_Take the March first as a representative<br />\nsample. Now I can understand that the<br />\neditors felt that the Times and the Post<br />\nweren't doing a good enough job with<br />\nAmin, really. However, it might have<br />\n1111.1111111M=111.1.7<br />\n<br />\nbeen more of interest to the students here<br />\nto know that the goals of the<br />\ndemonstration had been achieved, or that<br />\na Student Council evaluation of<br />\nintersession had been published, or even<br />\nthat Isaac Asimov was going to speak at<br />\ngraduation. In fact, in the pitiful four<br />\npages of copy (I refuse to even comment<br />\non the idiocy that prompts the use of the<br />\nfront page of a newspaper for a trivia<br />\nquiz), there is not one single news story<br />\nabout activities on the Homewood<br />\ncanpus, much less about the student<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nIt is the responsibility of journalists to<br />\nreport the news. Compared to the N-L, I<br />\nhad better reporting in my high school<br />\npaper, the Palmetto Panther of Miami,<br />\nFla. The absence of anything resembling<br />\ncampus news from the pages of the N-L<br />\nthese past two years has probably done<br />\nmore to promulgate the \"Limpid pool of<br />\napathy\" (feh!) than the activity or lack<br />\nthereof on the part of the Council.<br />\nMind you, I'm not even asking for<br />\nintegrity. It wouldn't have mattered if<br />\nthere had been slanted stories. There<br />\nshould, however, have been some stories!<br />\nUnless the students are informed about<br />\nwhat the SC is doing, it might as well<br />\nmight not be done. The real crime that<br />\nthe N-L committed was of omission, the<br />\n<br />\nmost heinous possible sin for a<br />\nnewspaper. If the Council was doing<br />\nnothing, it was the responsibility of<br />\nresponsible journalists to report this.l<br />\nrealize that not all campus stories are<br />\nexciting, but all news can't be Watergate,<br />\neither. For better or worse, of late mostly<br />\nthe latter, the N-L has,been the major<br />\norgan through which information has<br />\nbeen disseminated on this campus.<br />\nFeatures are nice, but we already have a<br />\nliterary magazine.

The level of<br />\ncompetition is in descending order, an A team, B team,<br />\nand C team. Each school puts three women in each<br />\ndivision. The Jays entered six players, freshmen Joann<br />\nBeckwith and Lisa Gottesfeld and sophomore Kate Foster<br />\nin the A leve. while senior Marlene Tandy, junior Barb<br />\nThomas, and sophomore Nancy Tang were entered in the<br />\n<br />\nhinted that Hopkins was completely outclassed by their<br />\nopponents. \"That's what really grills me,\" twanged Okie<br />\nshooter Dave Smith, \"They're just passing us off as a<br />\nbunch of incompetents.\"<br />\nWhatever Georgetown may or. may not have been<br />\nthinking prior to Friday's match is immaterial. What is<br />\nimportant. is that Hopkins posted what may be one of the<br />\nhighest scores ever fired by a Hopkins - squad-1272.<br />\n(Higher scores, posted in the early 60's and late 50's by<br />\nwinning Hopkins' teams are less indicative of ability than<br />\ntoday's more difficult 'targets. Howard Leadbetter<br />\nexplained the differences: \"You have to consider the type<br />\nof target now used, compared with the ones used some 20<br />\nor so years ago. Scores were naturally higher, since the<br />\ntargets were a little larger and the position of the<br />\nconcentric rings different. The lowest score was a 5; now<br />\nit's 1; and the bull (perfect score) was a little circle, rather<br />\nthan the pinpoint we now use.\")<br />\nGeorgetown's six-man squad, missing a top firer due to<br />\nillness, simply fell apart and were able to muster only an<br />\n1196. In comparison, the superb shooting of Leadbetter<br />\n(260) , Kanchanaraksa (259), Gerhart (252), Moss(251)<br />\n,<br />\nand co-captain Terranova (250) carried the Jays to<br />\nvictory. Once again, the depth of Hopkins' 12-man squad<br />\nproved itself invaluable. A tired opponent shooter wrYIY<br />\nremarked, \"You can't afford to stumble when you've<br />\nonly got six men to work with.\"<br />\nllopkins' coach Captain Phillips only remark was.<br />\n\"Outstanding,just outstanding,\" as he grinned broadly.<br />\nOutstanding is what the rifle team had better remain,<br />\nhowever, for the last two opponents, Gettysburg (away,<br />\nMarch 11) and Delaware (away, Match 19), are no one to<br />\ntrifle with. Delaware, in particular, has been firing close to<br />\n1270 in recent matches, and may in fact prove to be the<br />\ntoughest test the Hopkins' shooters must face in their<br />\nquest for a berth in the Divisional Championships.<br />\n<br />\nB competition. The A team finished fourth of five teams<br />\nwhile the B squad surged to second of seven teams, losing_<br />\nonly to the host team.<br />\n\"The .tournement was an excellent opportunity for all<br />\nthe girls to get a good workout,\" said Coach Joyce Hogan.<br />\n\"All six of them played most of the afternoon.\"<br />\nThe final match of the season was played against<br />\nFranklin and Marshall College. In that contest the team<br />\nwas without the services of Barb Thomas, one of the<br />\nteam's better players, who was ill. So to fill the open spot,<br />\nCoach Hogan moved all the other women up. The team<br />\nwas unable to make up for the void, though. and they lost<br />\nthe match.<br />\nIn between the final two matches the squash team met<br />\na faculty team and in sixteen games, the faculty took the<br />\nLady Jays 9-7. The star faculty competitors included Art<br />\nHigel of the computer center who qualified as the most<br />\nchauvinist player according to Coach Hogan. Art was<br />\nfollowed closely in machismo by Maurice Bessman. Other<br />\noutstanding faculty stars included Stuart Hulse, Judy<br />\nHall, and Alfonzo Caramazza of the psychology<br />\ndepartment and history graduate student Jim Goodyear.<br />\nWith the season over, the Lady Jays chose among<br />\nthemselves their stars and outstanding players. The Most<br />\nValuable Player was team captain Kate Foster. \"She was<br />\nboth invaluable to the team and terrific for the team<br />\nmorale,\" commented the coach.<br />\n\"Our best player was certainly Joann Beckwith,\" said<br />\nDr. Hogan. \"She just started playing the game to<br />\nNovember and then she just took off.\" The Unsung<br />\nHeroine award was given to junior Marybeth Fasan \u2022<br />\n\"Mary was always there to do anything that was needed.<br />\nShe as the cohesive force on the team.\"<br />\nThe Women Squash Team has now completed their<br />\nsecond year on a successful note and the future looks<br />\ngood.<br />\n\"We should be moving into the top ten within the next<br />\nfew years,\" said Coach Hogan. \"Our best players are no<br />\nolder than sophomores now, so we should get better.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "e winner is.....p\u20222<br /><br />\nThE liopluNs<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\nvol,lxxxi, no. 38/tuesday. march 8,1977/news-letter/baltimore, maryland<br /><br />\nConspiracy and bucks<br />\np.3<br /><br />\nUndergrads grumble about housing hubbub<br />\nBy GAYLE COHEN<br />\nMarch, as the traditional month of housing headaches,<br />\nhas Hopkins students scurrying to secure apartments/for<br />\nthe upcoming year.

The thrust of the report<br /><br />\nNN<br /><br />\nconcerns the other 80% of the undergraduates.<br />\nThe report argues that the university's housing policies<br />\nare illogical. The university assumes full responsibility for<br />\nthe freshmen as the youngest and least experienced<br />\nstudents, yet it takes a higher level of responsibility for<br />\nhousing older, more experienced graduate students than it<br />\ndoes for undergraduate upperclassmen, the report states,<br />\n\"In principle, this should be the other way around.\"<br />\nDiscrimination on the part of community landlords<br />\nfurther complicates undergraduates' problems.<br />\nApproximately<br />\none-third- of the housing notice's received by the<br />\nOff-Campus Housing Office specify that only graduate<br />\nstudents are acceptable tenants. Barred from several area<br />\nhousing units, but lacking transportation to move outside<br />\nthe vicinity of campus, the undergraduates often must<br />\ntake sub-standard lodgings at inflated prices.<br />\nThe Student Council's advocacy of \"a greater share, in<br />\nproportion to their population of the university-owned<br /><br />\nhousing, than the share allocated to graduates,\" is,<br />\naccording to Alexander, \"not a question of wants, but of<br />\nneeds and of satisfying needs. It's a question of scarcity,<br />\nso obviously not all needs will be satisfied, but in the way<br />\nthe scarcity if allocated, it should be more rational.\"<br />\nIn view of the graduate students' greater suitability to<br />\noff-campus housing, the Student Council has called for \"a<br />\nlong-term transition from the current situation to a more<br />\nequitable one.\" Suggestions have included a university<br />\nguarantee to house every first-year graduate and every<br />\nfirst-year undergraduate, with the remainder of the<br />\nstudents participating in the lottery. It has also been<br />\nsuggested that both undergraduates and graduates be<br />\nassigned housing through the lottery system.<br />\nPresently, the university assigns its undergraduate<br />\nhousing facilities by a lottery during spring semester for<br />\nthe next academic year. Graduate units are assigned on a<br />\nfirst-come, first-served basis.<br />\nUndergraduate and graduate housing arrangements also<br />\ndiffer in their contracts. Undergraduates have time<br />\ncontracts which cover the duration of the academic year,<br />\nI! while graduates have full-year contracts. Therefore, if the<br />\nuniversity decides to increase its number of undergraduate<br />\ntenants, it will lose a substantial amount of money.<br />\nIn commenting on the Student Council report, Larry<br />\nFrelow of the Off-Campus Housing Office said, \"If we<br />\nwere going to house everyone on campus, we'd have to go<br />\nto mandatory housing, and I don't think tile students<br />\nwant that.\"<br />\nHowever, Alexander said, \"There is a notion on the<br />\npart of the administration that a lot of people don't want<br />\nanything to do with university housing, that a lot of<br />\npeople want to go off campus. I think this is out of touch<br />\nwith reality.\" He cited the large attendance at last week's<br />\nlottery information session as evidence of student<br />\ninterest.<br />\nThe university owns seven off-campus apartment<br />\nbuildings. Three of these\u2014Homewood, the Baltimorean,<br />\nand Bradford--are inhabited by graduate students and<br />\naccount for a total of 351 spaces. Another three<br />\nbuildings\u2014Wolman, Rogers, and Wyman Park\u2014are<br />\noccupied by undergraduates and have 243 spaces. The<br />\nseventh building, McCoy, which houses both graduates<br />\nand undergraduates, has 208 spaces. According to Student<br />\nCouncil figures, this puts the maximum capacity for<br />\nhousing graduates at 498, whereas that for non-freshman<br />\nundergraduates is only 313.<br />\nThe fate of their future allotment has not yet been<br />\ndecided. According to Alexander, \"As far as we (the<br />\nStudent Council) are concerned, the first step is for tile<br />\nuniversity to commit itself in principle.\"<br /><br />\npage 2/news-letter/march 8,1977<br /><br />\nThe complete campus<br />\nnotes from the tues. staff<br />\nThe JHU New Political Caucus is<br />\nsponsoring a film series about people's<br />\nliberation struggles this weekend<br />\ncalled \"Enemies of the People.\"<br />\nThursday, March 10\u2014Hearts and<br />\nMinds.

Many, inside and outside of<br />\nthe government, are attempting to forge a<br />\nnew political philosophy, a new strategy<br />\nof stabilization to accomodate the<br />\neconomic and political facts of life.<br />\nCarter's National Security Chief Zbigniew<br />\nBrzezinski calls this condition \"America<br />\nin a Hostile World.\"<br />\nDuring the primaries, Carter<br />\ncampaigned as an \"outsider,\" a politician<br />\nremoved from, the Washington scene. He<br />\nwas perceived as an adversary of the<br />\n\"Eastern Establishment\" who have<br />\nconferred a continuous bipartisan foreign<br />\nPolicy, regardless of what party happens<br />\nto be in office. David Halberstam<br />\nPortrayed these \"experts\" responsible for<br />\nVietnam as \"the best and the brightest.\"<br />\nIn the presidential campaign, Jimmy \"I'll<br />\nnever tell a lie\" Carter intentionally gave<br />\nthe impression there would be a clean<br />\nsweep of such types and promised \"a new<br />\ngeneration of leaders.\"<br />\nThus, the unsuspecting Carter voter<br />\ncast his ballot with the belief his<br />\ncandidate meant what he said ,and said<br />\nwhat he meant. To the more naive<br />\nsupporters of this \"populist\", the election<br />\nwas viewed as a contest between<br />\ngovernment by elite and government by<br />\nthe people.<br />\nBefore the Cabinet appointments were<br />\nmade, Hamilton Jordan, director of the<br />\nCarter campaign, confidently stated \"If<br />\nafter the inauguration, you find -a Cy<br />\nVance as Secretary' of State and a<br />\nZbigniew Brzezinski as head of National<br />\nSecurity, then I would say we failed. And<br />\nI'd quit. You're going to see new faces,<br />\nnew ideas. The government is going to be<br />\nrun by people you have never heard of.\"<br />\nSoon, Carter selected a Cabinet filled<br />\nwith what a writer for the San Francisco<br />\nExaminer has labelled a \"true elite,<br />\ncomprised of what many have called<br />\nAmerica's 'shadow government.' They<br />\nmove easily in and out of high positions<br />\nin the private 'sector and government<br />\nthrough a network of school , club, and<br />\nbusiness associations.\" What is most<br />\nstriking about the Carter appointments is<br />\nnot that their previous service in<br />\ngovernment or even their lengthy<br />\ncorporate ties but that, at last count,<br />\nDean of Students Jakie Hall's response<br />\nto the Student Council proposals<br />\nconcerning Follett's bookstore has gone<br />\nfrom initial enthusiasm to a dull hurrah.<br />\nThe time between Hall's initial pormises<br />\nand subsequent action has lengthened<br />\nin determindly. According to Sheldon<br />\nHimelfarb, head of the Bookstore<br />\nTaskforce, \"action was promised two<br />\nmonths ago and no one has done<br />\nanything yet.\" This, he said, was \"very<br />\nindicative of the way it's been in the<br />\npast.\"<br />\nAccording to Hall, who is responsible<br />\nfor making the final decision on Follett's<br />\nfuture, the issues presented by the<br />\nBookstore Taskforce are currently being<br />\nlooked into. Hall says he will be visiting<br />\nHarvard University to discuss their co-op<br />\norganization. Hall also says he has spoken<br />\nwith Follett's manager and district<br />\nmanager 'in an effort to \"strengthen<br />\ncommunications\" over such things as<br />\ndelays in ordering and receiving<br />\ntextbooks. Other meetings are being<br />\nscheduled' and Hall says that \"something<br />\nshould already be taking place.\" Hall says<br />\ne will make a final decision before<br /><br />\nsixteen high posts are held by members of<br />\na private organization called the<br />\n\"Trilateral Commission\" whose North<br />\nAmerican membership is approximately<br />\nseventy.<br />\nIn 1972, Chase Manhatten Bank<br />\nPresident David Rockefeller, organizer of<br />\nthe group, selected Carter a founding<br />\nmember. The President admits he<br />\n\"received basic foreign policy education<br />\nunder its auspices.\" Francois Sauzey,<br />\nproject director, recalls when Carter<br />\nannounced his candidacy, most fellow<br />\nmembers considered it a \"joke,\" but<br />\nBrzezinski saw Carter's potential and<br /><br />\nAccording to David Rockefeller, the<br />\npurpose of the organization is \"to bring<br />\nthe best brains in the world to bear on<br />\nthe problems of the future.\"<br />\nThe North-American membership list is<br />\ntop heavy with multi-national executives,<br />\nbanking figures, academics, and public<br />\nofficials. Its members consider themselves<br />\n\"liberal internationalists\" and their policy<br />\nproposals \"innovative.\" However,<br />\nconspiracy theorists ranging from the<br />\nJohn Birch Society to the U.S. Labor<br />\nParty have sensed sinister intentions and<br />\n-have attempted to expose efforts by the<br />\nRockefellers to establish a<br /><br />\napparently felt that he was an ideal<br />\npolitician to latch onto. Other members<br />\nof the select Commission, besides Carter<br />\nand Brzezinski, are Vice-President<br />\nMondale, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance,<br />\nSecretary of Defense Harold Brown,<br />\nSecretary of Treasury Michael<br />\nBlumenthal, and U.N. Ambassador<br />\nAndrew Young.<br />\nStyled as \"a private<br />\nNorth- American -European-Japanese<br />\nInitiative on Matters of Common<br />\nConcern,\" the commission was<br />\nestablished to foster a \"trialogue\" among<br />\nthe U.S. and her traditional allies.<br /><br />\nsupra-government. While the arguments<br />\nof these professional fanatics strain the<br />\nintellect, the fact remains that almost the<br />\nentire carter administration are, indeed,<br />\ntrilateral members. A more reasoned<br />\nanalysis is offered by William Greider in<br />\nThe Washington Post: \"It's Mem-kers are<br />\nnot drafting \u00a7ecret blueprints for ruling<br />\ntne world, but they are defining the<br />\nperceptions that may dominate U.S.<br />\nforeign policy in the next era.\" That era<br />\nhas arrived.<br />\nWriting in Foreign Policy, Brzezinski<br />\nstated the major problem: \"We are today<br />\nin the midst of a systematic crisis...The<br /><br />\nSpring Vacation.<br />\nHowever, according to Himelfarb, the<br />\naction taken thus far \"does not address<br />\nthe Taskforce's major concern over funds<br />\nleaving the campus which would mean<br />\nthe elimination of Follett's.\" The Follett<br />\nBookstore, which has a ten year contract,<br />\nrequires six months notice on any<br />\ndecision of change. This means that Hall<br />\nmust take action before the ends of the<br /><br />\ncould be kept within the University<br />\nrather than lost to a private enterprise. In<br />\naddition, inflated costs for the<br />\nbookstore's aeratio; could be reduced.<br />\nProvost Richard P. Longaker yesterday<br />\nemphasized the sincerity of \"assurances\"<br />\nmade by the administration on the<br />\nuncertain issue of calendar reform.<br />\n\"The reason the administration can't<br />\ngive guarantees is because the whole<br /><br />\nCampus shorts:<br />\nFollett's and calendar<br />\nmonth if anything is to gg into effect in<br />\ntime for fall semester. So far, Himelfarb<br />\nsays, Hall has just been \"avoiding the<br />\nissue.\"<br />\nBased on an initial survey of Follett's<br />\npresent function, the Student Council<br />\nBookstore Taskforce maintains there<br />\nwould be substantial benefits to students<br />\nand the University if the University took<br />\nover. Profits made by the bookstore<br /><br />\nin at ter is still under discussion<br />\nthroughout the university. In way of<br />\nassurances, however, it should be noted<br />\nno significant opposition has turned up,<br />\nnor do I predict substantial opposition to<br />\noverride what we now assume will be the<br />\ncase. Exams will be before Christmas and<br />\nthere will be some form of intersession if<br />\nstudents and faculty wish.\"<br />\nThe Provost's statement echos a letter<br /><br />\ninternational system which emerged from<br />\nWorld War II is today open to challenge,<br />\nto many doubts, to many strains.\" For<br />\nmany foreign policy strategists, the<br />\nanswer to this crisis is the trilateral<br />\napproach of conciliation, rather thasi<br />\nconfrontation. Richard Ullman'has urged<br />\n\"a united front on the part of the<br />\nadvanced Western societies...to counter<br />\nthe new demands and militant action of,<br />\nthe Third World.\"<br />\nThis \"united we stand, divided we fall\"<br />\nphilosophy stems from the realization<br />\nthat America can no longer be the sole<br />\nleader of the world economic system;<br />\n\"cooperation\" is vital if the international<br />\nstatus quo is to be maintained. To do<br />\notherwise would lead to global anarchy.<br />\nThe Trilateralists believe the most serious<br />\nthreat to a stable world is the foreign<br />\nexchange crisis of the underdeveloped<br />\ncountries. These nations are unable to<br />\nrepay the bank loans needed to purchase<br />\nnecessary imports. The primary interest<br />\nof the Trilateral Commission in resolving<br />\nthis crisis is the restoration of a world<br />\neconomy conducive to trade and<br />\ninvestment. Thus, the commission has<br />\nproposed that further loans be extended<br />\nto these poor nations, so that imports<br />\nwould not be cut back with a resulting<br />\nworld depression.<br />\nIn the short run, such debt relief,<br />\nwhich the commission suggests, will<br />\nbolster a sagging world economic system.<br />\nHowever, many economists feel this will<br />\nnot solve the fundamental problem\u2014the<br />\ndependency of the poor nations on the<br />\nwealthy. According to Cheryl Payer, the<br />\nresult of borrowings by the less developed<br />\ncountries has amounted to a \"debt<br />\ntrap...an international system of debt<br />\npeonage,\" which dooms the financially<br />\naddicted country to perpetual<br />\nunderdevelopment. The commission is<br />\nsimply proposing yet another monetary<br />\n\"fix\" to perpetuate a cycle of<br />\ndependence which has benefitted the<br />\nindustrial countries at the expense of the<br />\npoor.<br />\nThe Trilateral approach appears to be<br />\none of management; it does not address<br />\nitself to -the structural inequality in the<br />\nworld today between the Northern<br />\ndeveloped countries and the Southern<br />\nunderdeveloped countries. The demands<br />\nof the latter for.a fair share of economic<br />\npower continue to go unheard. As this<br />\ninternational crisis builds, the<br />\nTrilateralists, in offering the few, concession they do, skirt the crucial<br />\nquestion of a just economic 0171,-.<br />\ntecently sent by President Steven Mulle<br />\nto Student Council President Steve<br />\nPonchak which says in part, \"It is my<br />\nintention to incorporate into the calendar<br />\nrevision the continued oppdrtunity for<br />\nHomewood undergraduates not enrolled<br />\nin interdivisional courses to take their<br />\nfinal examinations for the fall semester<br />\nbefore the Christmas/New Year's holiday<br />\nand the beginning for the second<br />\nsemester, whether the term intersession<br />\nremains or whether some other<br />\ndesignation is used for this period.\"<br />\nThe remaining stumbling block<br />\nbetween the conflicting parties is the<br />\nform of intersession; will it be credited or<br />\nnon-credited? \"There is no expectation at<br />\nthis point that credit will be granted, but<br />\nthere will be more discussion,\" the<br />\nProvost said, again not wishing to give the<br />\nstatement any finality.'Some faculty<br />\nmembers have criticized a credited<br />\nintersession because they \"doubt the<br />\nutility of a credited intersession and how<br />\ncredit is actually allotted,\" he said. Some<br />\nstudents and faculty have suggested<br />\nintersession credits be awarded on a<br />\nselective basis.<br /><br />\nthe hopkins news-letter<br /><br />\nlxxxi, no.<br /><br />\nop-ed<br /><br />\n38<br /><br />\nNight at the Hopkins saloon<br /><br />\nlibido<br />\nThe onslaught of early spring has the deviously<br />\nenchanting effect of pushing the winter into the past.<br />\nFrisbees whirl and libidinous instincts skyrocket.

Without analyzing the<br />\ninvidious style of the editorial (Can a<br />\n`muldaneness\" (sic) indeed be<br />\n\"breathless\"?), I think that it is fair to<br />\nsay that the N-L, in failing to meet the<br />\nmost elemental standards of campus<br />\njournalism for approximatelY the past<br />\ntwo years, had abdicated any right to<br />\nproduce a piece such as this editorial.<br />\nSpecifically, there has not been a<br />\nNews-Letter at Hopkins since shortly<br />\nafter the days of Savitz' fiefdom. Over<br />\nthe past two years, the editors and staff<br />\nof the N-L have shown an increasing<br />\nfrequency to treat the reporting of<br />\ncampus news as a violation of the<br />\nSherman Anti-Trust Act. Not only does<br />\nthis editorial fail to have a news peg in<br />\nthis issue, but I don't even remember the<br />\nlast issue that had a story about the<br />\nactivities of the SC. When was the last<br />\ntime that a reporter covered the meetings<br />\non a regular basis.<br />\n_Take the March first as a representative<br />\nsample. Now I can understand that the<br />\neditors felt that the Times and the Post<br />\nweren't doing a good enough job with<br />\nAmin, really. However, it might have<br />\n1111.1111111M=111.1.7<br /><br />\nbeen more of interest to the students here<br />\nto know that the goals of the<br />\ndemonstration had been achieved, or that<br />\na Student Council evaluation of<br />\nintersession had been published, or even<br />\nthat Isaac Asimov was going to speak at<br />\ngraduation. In fact, in the pitiful four<br />\npages of copy (I refuse to even comment<br />\non the idiocy that prompts the use of the<br />\nfront page of a newspaper for a trivia<br />\nquiz), there is not one single news story<br />\nabout activities on the Homewood<br />\ncanpus, much less about the student<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nIt is the responsibility of journalists to<br />\nreport the news. Compared to the N-L, I<br />\nhad better reporting in my high school<br />\npaper, the Palmetto Panther of Miami,<br />\nFla. The absence of anything resembling<br />\ncampus news from the pages of the N-L<br />\nthese past two years has probably done<br />\nmore to promulgate the \"Limpid pool of<br />\napathy\" (feh!) than the activity or lack<br />\nthereof on the part of the Council.<br />\nMind you, I'm not even asking for<br />\nintegrity. It wouldn't have mattered if<br />\nthere had been slanted stories. There<br />\nshould, however, have been some stories!<br />\nUnless the students are informed about<br />\nwhat the SC is doing, it might as well<br />\nmight not be done. The real crime that<br />\nthe N-L committed was of omission, the<br /><br />\nmost heinous possible sin for a<br />\nnewspaper. If the Council was doing<br />\nnothing, it was the responsibility of<br />\nresponsible journalists to report this.l<br />\nrealize that not all campus stories are<br />\nexciting, but all news can't be Watergate,<br />\neither. For better or worse, of late mostly<br />\nthe latter, the N-L has,been the major<br />\norgan through which information has<br />\nbeen disseminated on this campus.<br />\nFeatures are nice, but we already have a<br />\nliterary magazine.

Far<br />\nmore ominous was the fact that recently Georgetown had<br />\nbeen firing better than 1280, indicating an average score<br />\nof 256\u2014a figure which can only be beaten by the best<br />\nshooters in the league.<br />\nYet, last Friday, the tides were to be turned by the<br />\nhard-working Hoppies.

Losses in their final two games to the ladies of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and Franklin and Marshall<br />\nCollege prevented JHU from completing an undefeated<br />\nseason.<br />\nThe Lady Jays competed in the annual round robin<br />\ntournament at Perm on February 11. The level of<br />\ncompetition is in descending order, an A team, B team,<br />\nand C team. Each school puts three women in each<br />\ndivision. The Jays entered six players, freshmen Joann<br />\nBeckwith and Lisa Gottesfeld and sophomore Kate Foster<br />\nin the A leve. while senior Marlene Tandy, junior Barb<br />\nThomas, and sophomore Nancy Tang were entered in the<br /><br />\nhinted that Hopkins was completely outclassed by their<br />\nopponents. \"That's what really grills me,\" twanged Okie<br />\nshooter Dave Smith, \"They're just passing us off as a<br />\nbunch of incompetents.\"<br />\nWhatever Georgetown may or. may not have been<br />\nthinking prior to Friday's match is immaterial. What is<br />\nimportant. is that Hopkins posted what may be one of the<br />\nhighest scores ever fired by a Hopkins - squad-1272.<br />\n(Higher scores, posted in the early 60's and late 50's by<br />\nwinning Hopkins' teams are less indicative of ability than<br />\ntoday's more difficult 'targets. Howard Leadbetter<br />\nexplained the differences: \"You have to consider the type<br />\nof target now used, compared with the ones used some 20<br />\nor so years ago. Scores were naturally higher, since the<br />\ntargets were a little larger and the position of the<br />\nconcentric rings different. The lowest score was a 5; now<br />\nit's 1; and the bull (perfect score) was a little circle, rather<br />\nthan the pinpoint we now use.\")<br />\nGeorgetown's six-man squad, missing a top firer due to<br />\nillness, simply fell apart and were able to muster only an<br />\n1196. In comparison, the superb shooting of Leadbetter<br />\n(260) , Kanchanaraksa (259), Gerhart (252), Moss(251)<br />\n,<br />\nand co-captain Terranova (250) carried the Jays to<br />\nvictory. Once again, the depth of Hopkins' 12-man squad<br />\nproved itself invaluable. A tired opponent shooter wrYIY<br />\nremarked, \"You can't afford to stumble when you've<br />\nonly got six men to work with.\"<br />\nllopkins' coach Captain Phillips only remark was.<br />\n\"Outstanding,just outstanding,\" as he grinned broadly.<br />\nOutstanding is what the rifle team had better remain,<br />\nhowever, for the last two opponents, Gettysburg (away,<br />\nMarch 11) and Delaware (away, Match 19), are no one to<br />\ntrifle with. Delaware, in particular, has been firing close to<br />\n1270 in recent matches, and may in fact prove to be the<br />\ntoughest test the Hopkins' shooters must face in their<br />\nquest for a berth in the Divisional Championships.<br /><br />\nB competition. The A team finished fourth of five teams<br />\nwhile the B squad surged to second of seven teams, losing_<br />\nonly to the host team.<br />\n\"The .tournement was an excellent opportunity for all<br />\nthe girls to get a good workout,\" said Coach Joyce Hogan.<br />\n\"All six of them played most of the afternoon.\"<br />\nThe final match of the season was played against<br />\nFranklin and Marshall College. In that contest the team<br />\nwas without the services of Barb Thomas, one of the<br />\nteam's better players, who was ill. So to fill the open spot,<br />\nCoach Hogan moved all the other women up. The team<br />\nwas unable to make up for the void, though. and they lost<br />\nthe match.<br />\nIn between the final two matches the squash team met<br />\na faculty team and in sixteen games, the faculty took the<br />\nLady Jays 9-7. The star faculty competitors included Art<br />\nHigel of the computer center who qualified as the most<br />\nchauvinist player according to Coach Hogan. Art was<br />\nfollowed closely in machismo by Maurice Bessman. Other<br />\noutstanding faculty stars included Stuart Hulse, Judy<br />\nHall, and Alfonzo Caramazza of the psychology<br />\ndepartment and history graduate student Jim Goodyear.<br />\nWith the season over, the Lady Jays chose among<br />\nthemselves their stars and outstanding players. The Most<br />\nValuable Player was team captain Kate Foster. \"She was<br />\nboth invaluable to the team and terrific for the team<br />\nmorale,\" commented the coach.<br />\n\"Our best player was certainly Joann Beckwith,\" said<br />\nDr. Hogan. \"She just started playing the game to<br />\nNovember and then she just took off.\" The Unsung<br />\nHeroine award was given to junior Marybeth Fasan \u2022<br />\n\"Mary was always there to do anything that was needed.<br />\nShe as the cohesive force on the team.\"<br />\nThe Women Squash Team has now completed their<br />\nsecond year on a successful note and the future looks<br />\ngood.<br />\n\"We should be moving into the top ten within the next<br />\nfew years,\" said Coach Hogan. \"Our best players are no<br />\nolder than sophomores now, so we should get better.\"<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 41199, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "c1ef8b2a-90d2-41e5-8825-1f589753b605", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14347-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14347, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "1de7e2d2-3a8a-4c2f-bb18-464954381a80", "url": "/node/14347"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "b97415fd-8ed6-4156-b8e2-5dfc1fea933f"}]}
