He has been attractively<br />\nirresponsible, but not significantly so, identified mainly<br />\nby his age group between maturity and adolescence,<br />\nmore concerned with graceful growth into careerhood<br />\nand adaptability than with questioning the effectiveness<br />\nof his education.<br />\n<br />\nWhat in the nature of the student, or in the nature<br />\nof the world has led students to go about the unheard<br />\n. of business questioning authority and policy of the wincational system?<br />\nAn acceptable explanation is given in that students<br />\ntoo longer need to bite their toenails or burn Christmas<br />\ntrees to express their distress with the established order.<br />\nCivil Rights anti its growing acceptability, tutorial<br />\nprojects, active and widespread dissent against existing<br />\ngovernment policy have !ended a legitimacy and a popularity to student agitation through extra-curricular protest. While fighting for the rights of the urban depressed,<br />\nthe students have come to some conclusions about their<br />\nown rights, drawing parallels from the bureaucratic<br />\npolitician to their own bureaucratic administrator.<br />\nThe student revolt is much more, however, than a<br />\nturn from apathy to agitation. The universities themselves have made significant changes in direction; they<br />\nhave expanded into more diverse and immense operations. Vi hile providing greater opportunities for the student, and thus deferring to increased capabilities of the<br />\n, students, it has, simultaneuosly, depersonalized the university, rendering the student even more of an object<br />\nof an educational system. The university is no longer<br />\nmerely in loco parentis but is a mechanization of educalion, an absentee and inflexible landlord.<br />\nWe are not to say that increased mechanization<br />\nmid diversity (the combination of which is known as<br />\nmultiversity) is unreservedly bad, or even to say, that<br />\nif such a thing is bad, that there are not exceptions.<br />\nBut we are to say that with greater complexity, the university can easily over-extend itself and lose sight of<br />\nthe student for all the education that stands in the way.<br />\nThere are indications at Hopkins, that obligations<br />\nto the non-academic community occasionally take precedence over the fulfillment of its academic creed. It is<br />\nnot uncommon for such a university to become inflexible in regards to social issues, over-sensitive to its<br />\nimage, entirely too formal and structured, in fact a<br />\nmass of outstretched tentacles, tangled and tied to extraimiversity dependencies.<br />\nNor is it uncommon for the student to take exireption to such a state of affairs. The university, with<br />\na broader field of interest, unavoidably infects the student with greater dimensions of thought and greater<br />\nconsciousness of social and political issues,<br />\nIf for no other reason than mere exposure, the<br />\nistudent is prompted to make judgments in and about<br />\nthe university and to take action consistent with his conscience; and while the university can not afford to heed<br />\nits conscience on such issues, the student will have it<br />\nno other way. In frustration, the student resents that<br />\nthe University, intended to he an arena for experiencing<br />\nand acting on the world, is but a funnel through which<br />\nshe world is channeled through education to act on him.<br />\n,<br />\n'<br />\nThe administrative officials, then, often take the rap<br />\nfrom the more agitated of the students' consciences, not<br />\nonly because the university has failed to live up to the<br />\nstudents' standards within and without the university,<br />\nbut also because the university itself has triggered the<br />\nreaction.<br />\nL.<br />\n<br />\nKOPER<br />\n<br />\nSICILIA<br />\n<br />\nELI ERY<br />\n<br />\nships, and extracurricular activities themselves should on the<br />\nmost part, be determined, at<br />\nleast, with a committee of faculty and a committee of students. In other words, an interaction is what I think should<br />\ndevelop, rather than exactly a<br />\none-sided education. Also, I<br />\nthink as far as Hopkins goes, to<br />\nspecify it a little bit, right now<br />\nseveral ad hoc groups are being<br />\nformed by the faculty. These<br />\ngroups have no permanence and<br />\nthey're actually selected by the<br />\nfaculty. They aren't put up to<br />\nstudent recognition, even of the<br />\nfact that there are such groups<br />\nand I think the students should<br />\nhave something to do with this.<br />\n<br />\nI think a greater rote 44<br />\nawareness and reception on the<br />\npart of the administration which<br />\nat first may sound like less disSandy Cohn, Junior<br />\ncipline', but in reality result its<br />\nWhat in your personal opinion<br />\nmore discipline and less freedom<br />\nis the significance of the term<br />\nwould, if put in the right direc\"university reform\"?<br />\ntion actually be a greater beneUniversity reform, rather than<br />\nfit to the university and the stu\"reforming a university\" I' think<br />\ndents.<br />\nwould imply more of a student<br />\nDo you think that the stsparticipation than in extracurdents themselves are Matura<br />\nricular activities, in determining<br />\nenough to accept the responsicurricular activities, studentbility in determining the policy<br />\nfaculty-relationships, something<br />\nof the university, and do you<br />\nlike this.<br />\nfeel students should by rights<br />\nTo what extent do you believe<br />\nparticipate in decisions effecting<br />\nstudent participation determine<br />\nthemselves?<br />\nuniversity policy, to what extent<br />\nWell, as regards to the first<br />\ncan this be applied to Hopkins<br />\npart of the question, I think that<br />\nand in what form?<br />\nmost of the students are capable<br />\nWell, I think to generalize the<br />\nof making decisions which affect<br />\nquestion, you have to say to<br />\nthemselves, but I think by far<br />\nwhat extent can it apply to any<br />\nthat most of the students probEvans Hays, sophomore.<br />\nuniversity, and<br />\nacademically,<br />\nably wouldn't have the niformaWhat does the term university<br />\nI'm not quite sure whether the<br />\ntion or the ability, or perhaps<br />\nreform<br />\nmean<br />\nto<br />\nyou regarding<br />\nstudents are educated enough to<br />\neven<br />\nthe desire to set up rules<br />\nthe<br />\nthesis that students should<br />\ndetermine their own curriculum<br />\nparticipate more in forming which would effect them, at<br />\nin a generalized manner.<br />\nleast all of the rules.

Any 'non-conformist'<br />\ncertainly feels the pressures towards conformity<br />\nexerted upon him in the university. But more<br />\nsignificant is the firing of 31 teachers at St.<br />\nJohns in New York over a dispute concerning<br />\nacademic freedom: this is surely a sign of a<br />\ngrowing Inflexibility in academic quarters.<br />\nBerkeley, on the other hand, shows decay and<br />\nopposition on the other end of the spectrum,<br />\nwhich finds students demanding the sort of<br />\nconsideration from the universitly which would<br />\nmake their studies more significant and valuable.

KORN<br />\n<br />\nA system of corrupt local<br />\npolice is a cornerstone of American Democracy. It is time that<br />\nvarious citizens groups and dogooders of a similar ilk realize<br />\nit. For if local police accept<br />\nbribes and other goodies in the<br />\nline of dubious duty they are<br />\nonly exercising a responsible<br />\neconomic control over the community. The police offer a valuable comodity\u2014Government. If<br />\ntheir genre is less sophisticated<br />\nthan the city council kind, it is<br />\nno less effective. Urban American history proves the rule that<br />\ncorruption is a local commodity.<br />\nWhether Bobby Kennedy can do<br />\nmore for New York than Boss<br />\nTweed remains to be seen.<br />\nNevertheless, the January 10<br />\nissue of the Baltimore Sun announced that \"The Baltimore<br />\nPolice Department was closely<br />\nexamined and found to be seriously inadequate by the nation's<br />\nleading firm specializing in<br />\npolice administration.\" It seems<br />\nthat the Baltimore Police sacrificed their right to \"govern\"<br />\nby tolerating the most obvious<br />\nand flagrant kind of corruption<br />\nin the history of western man.<br />\nBecause of garbled records it<br />\nwas even impossible for the investigating agency to determine<br />\nthe number of convictions resulting from the work of the<br />\nBaltimore Police Department.<br />\nA team of experts from<br />\nThe International Association of<br />\n<br />\nChiefs of Police was retained at<br />\na cost of $52,000 to investigate<br />\nthe efficiency of the 3000-man<br />\nforce. They found what a simple<br />\nexpenditure of 15 cents for a<br />\nbeer at the Northside, given to<br />\nBob The Cop would have revealed; that the Baltimore<br />\nPolice are among the moot<br />\ngrossly inefficient agencies since<br />\nMack Sennet's Keystone Kops.<br />\nFor the Baltimore Police<br />\nscorned the old Chicago style of<br />\ncorruption and inefficiency. Formerly such agencies worked on<br />\nthe principle that each extorted<br />\naccording to his rank. The Baltimore force, it was found, was<br />\nrotten down to the Meter Maids.<br />\nThe girls called in sick for a<br />\ntotal of 882 days in 1964; with a<br />\nforce of 20 maids, that works out<br />\nto a total of 44 days, or a month<br />\nand a half absence per maid.<br />\nEarly in 1965, their male<br />\ncounterparts investigated four<br />\ncares of violent death adjudged<br />\nby them to have been caused by<br />\nnatural causes. Later examination revealed stab and gunshot<br />\nwounds in the bodies. Records<br />\nalso revealed that often there<br />\nwere six tb ten officers, plus their<br />\nsuperiors, present at the interrogation of a given suspect.<br />\nDespite such pressure, the record<br />\nof criminal convictions (as near<br />\nas it could be estimated) was<br />\namong the lowest in the nation.<br />\nA gfade school dropout is eligible for the Baltimore Force if<br />\nhe can pass the eighth grade<br />\nequivilency test.

One was the now<br />\nfamous \"Mad\",, and ,the other,<br />\nand by, far the ,elder and more<br />\nfirMly .established, was the infamous ''Congressional Record.\"<br />\nThese two, great bastions of<br />\nhumor are now faced with a<br />\nruthless competitor who threatens to spirit away a great portion of their Collective readerships. The new face on the<br />\nhumor scene is \"Time, the<br />\nWeekly Newsmagazine\", with a<br />\nhilarious feature called \"the<br />\nman of the year.\"<br />\nThis mild mannered reporter,<br />\nengaged in a never ending quest<br />\nfor humor, and not being too<br />\nProud to borrow from so venerable a publication as \"Time\",<br />\nwould like to explore this man<br />\nOf the year idea. It is an idea<br />\nWhich, it seems, one can easily<br />\nuPply\u2022 to a great university,<br />\nWhich can produce at least one,<br />\nIf nett an entire basketfull, of<br />\nmen of the Year.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Hop has<br />\nlie such formidable personage<br />\nas General Westmoreland to<br />\nvenerate and to make pockmarked Clay busts of, so we are<br />\nforced to turn to the more cornMon man, but fear not\u2014thereis<br />\ngreatness in adversity. The criteria \"Time\" used to choose its<br />\nMan are simple. He is the one<br />\nWho has had the greatest influence, for good or ill, on world<br />\naffairs.' It is interesting to note<br />\nthat It is never stated which<br />\nsort of influence was exerted.<br />\nI think, if we are to transfer,<br />\nthe \"Time\" idea to the Hop, the<br />\nWinning party Would have to be<br />\nan entire group, rather than<br />\nOne mare This is not a breach<br />\n(It precedent, and has been done<br />\nby \"Time\".<br />\nThere is one group on the<br />\nHop' campus, on the rolling<br />\nlawns of scenic Homewood, ol<br />\nithich it can be said that they<br />\n<br />\nPAGE FIVE<br />\n<br />\nhave, in the same sense that<br />\nWestmoreland has, contributed<br />\nthe most, good or ill, to history<br />\nIn the making.

This procedure certainly has<br />\nbeen an affront against democracy. For years, the courts have<br />\nfelt that this problem was a<br />\npolitical one and refused tct take<br />\naction. In 1962, in the case<br />\nBaker v. Carr, the Supreme<br />\nCourt by a vote of 6 to 2 entered the field and demanded<br />\nthat the popularly elected house<br />\nof the state legislature be apportioned so that each man's vote<br />\nwould be equal. The decision's<br />\nIntent was to promote justice,<br />\nbut instead it opened a Pandora's<br />\nbox.<br />\n<br />\nfederal innovation. It was patterned after the New Jersey Plan<br />\noffered at the Constitutional<br />\nConvention by William Paterson, whose home state had used<br />\nthe Senate since 1764. Chief<br />\nJustice Warren goes on to deny<br />\nthe possibility of the retention<br />\nof the Senate even if the state<br />\nvoted by referendum to retain<br />\nit. He backs this contention up<br />\nby the 14th Amendment. Justice<br />\nJohn Harlan, Tom C. Clark, and<br />\nPotter Stewart vigorously disagree with Warren and have<br />\nmade their opinions known.<br />\nBecause of this decision, Senator Dirksen introduced a Constitutional Amendment which<br />\nwould give the states the right<br />\nto maintain the Senate upon the<br />\npassage of a referendum every<br />\nten years. On August 4, 1965,<br />\nthe Amendment received 57 favored votes (29 Republicans, 18<br />\nSouthern Democrats, and 10<br />\nNorthern Democrats) and 39<br />\nnegative votes (33 Northern<br />\nDemocrats, 3 Southern Democrats, and 3 Republicans). This<br />\nwas 7 votes short of the necessary %rds. Had the vote taken<br />\nplace prior to 1964, it probably<br />\nwould have passed.<br />\nThe 3 Republicans to vote<br />\n<br />\nagainst the measure were Caleb<br />\nBoggs<br />\nDel.), Clifford Case<br />\n(N.J.), and Jacob Javits (N.Y.)<br />\nJavits had been wavering on the<br />\nIssue for months and at the last<br />\nminute intrOduced a substitute<br />\nbill which Dirksen found unsatisfactory. Senator Case felt that<br />\nthe \"one man, one vote\" decision would help the Republican<br />\nParty politically. He maintained<br />\nthat the heavy Democratic rural<br />\nareas in the South would lose<br />\nstrength to the more liberal and<br />\nRepublican cities. In the North,<br />\nhe felt that the rural Republicans would be forced to adjust<br />\nto the liberal needs of the cities,<br />\nand thereby would win more<br />\nstate-wide elections. His analysis<br />\nIs probably correct, but he fails<br />\nto consider principles of government beyond pragmatic politics.<br />\nActually the retention of the<br />\nSenate probably would work to<br />\nthe disadvantage of the Republican Party in the long run. In<br />\nrecent years for example, the<br />\nU. S. Senate has been much more<br />\nliberal than the House of Representatives.

First, you can<br />\nmarry money.(I don't mean you marry the money itself; I<br />\nmean you marry a person who has money. Weddings between people and currency have not been legal anywhere in<br />\nthe United States since the Smoot-Hawley Act. Personna\u00ae<br />\nStainless Steel Blades, on the other hand, are legal everywhere and are, indeed, used with great pleasure and satisfaction in all fifty states'of the Union and Duluth. I bring<br />\nup Personna Stainless Steel Blades because this column is<br />\nsponsored by the makers of Personna Stainless Steel Blades,<br />\nand they are inclined to get edgy if I omit to mention their<br />\nproduct. Some of them get edgy and some get double-edgy<br />\nbecause Personna Blades come both in Injector style and<br />\nDouble Edge style.)<br />\nBut I digress. I was saying you can marry money but, of<br />\ncourse, you will not because you are a high-minded, cleanliving, pure-hearted,freckle-faced American kid. Therefore,<br />\nto keep from thinking, you must try the second method:<br />\nyou must learn how to take lecture notes.<br />\nAccording to a recent survey, eleven out of ten American<br />\nundergraduates do not know the proper way to take lecture<br />\nnotes. To illustrate this appalling statistic, let us suppose<br />\nyou are taking a course in history. Let us further suppose<br />\nthe lecturer is lecturing on the ruling houses of England.<br />\nYou listen intently. You write diligently in your notebook,<br />\nmaking a topic outline as you have been taught. Like this.:<br />\nI. House of Plantagenet.<br />\nII. House of Lancaster.<br />\nIII. House of York. t,<br />\n<br />\nThen you stop. You put aside your pen. You blink back<br />\n<br />\na tear, for you cannot go on. Oh, yes, you know very well<br />\nthat the next ruling house is the House of Tudor. The trouble is you don't know the Roman numeral that comes after<br />\nIt may, incidentally, be of some comfort to learn that<br />\nyou are not the only people who don't know Roman numerals. The fact is, the Romans never knew them either. Oh,I<br />\nsuppose they could tell you how much V or X were or like<br />\nthat, but when it came to real zingers like LXI or MMC,<br />\nthey just flang away their styluses and went downtown to<br />\nhave a bath or take in a circus or maybe stab Caesar a few<br />\ntimes.<br />\nYou may wonder why Rome stuck with these ridiculous<br />\nnumerals when the Arabs had such a nice, simple system.<br />\nWell,sir, the fact is that Emperor Vespasian tried like crazy<br />\nto buy the Arabic numeralsfrom Suleiman The Magnificent,<br />\nbut Suleiman wouldn't do business\u2014not even when Vespasian raised his bid to 100,000 gold piastres, plus he offered<br />\nto throw in the Colosseum, the Appian Way,and Technicolor.<br />\nSo Rome stuck With Roman numerals\u2014to its sorrow, as<br />\nft turned out. One day in the Forum, Cicero and Pliny gob<br />\nto arguing about how much is CDL times MVIX. Well,sir,<br />\npretty soon everyone in town came around to join the hassle. In all the excitement, nobody remembered to lock the<br />\nnorth gate and\u2014wham! before you could say ars longs\u2014in<br />\nnoshed the Goths,the Visigoths,and the Green Bay Packers/<br />\nWell, sir, that's the way the empire crumbles, and I digress. Let's get back to lecture notes. Let's also say a word<br />\nabout Burma Shave\u00ae. Why? Because Burma Shave is made<br />\nby the makers of Personna Blades who, it will be recalled,<br />\nare the sponsors of this column. They are also the sponsors<br />\nof the ultimate in shaving luxury. First coat your kisser<br />\nwith Burma Shave, regular or menthol\u2014or, if you are the<br />\ndevil-may-care sort,some of each. Then whisk off your stubble with an incredibly sharp,unbelievably durable Personna<br />\nSlade, Injector or Double Edge\u2014remembering first to put<br />\nthe blade in a razor. The result: facial felicity, cutaneous<br />\nthee*, epidermal elysium. Whether you shave every day,<br />\nevery III days, or every VII, you'll always find Personns<br />\nsad Burma Shave a winning combination.<br />\n0 19611.

This means that achievement is generally scored on the<br />\nbasis of one's ability to spit back<br />\nwhat one is taught, for there is<br />\nlittle time for one to reflect on<br />\nand to weigh what he is told<br />\nin the most formal of manners.<br />\nSince certainly no one has cornered the market of truth, the<br />\nmost valuable part of the educational<br />\nexperience<br />\ncomes<br />\nthrough a dialogue between<br />\nlarge numbers of people, in<br />\nwhich a large number of ideas<br />\ncan be exchanged and considered. Under the present system,<br />\nthere is little time in class and<br />\nless time out of class for such<br />\ndiscussions, and, in general, the<br />\nway the university is set up at<br />\nHopkins does not stimulate such<br />\ndebate.<br />\nSDS would like to catalyze<br />\nstudent support to effect a beneficial change in these areas. This<br />\nis part of a long-range program<br />\nto make America a healthier,<br />\nmore equitable and more viable<br />\nSociety. SDS finds it very difficult to mobilize students on any<br />\nIssue, even those which affect<br />\nthem so directly as the university. The students of America,<br />\nhowever, should have an obligation to confront and to correct those tendencies which<br />\nthreaten our liberties and the<br />\njustness of our society. The<br />\ngreatest fear should be that<br />\nAmerica will become sterile and<br />\ndictatorial from within: this is<br />\na much more realistic sort of<br />\nfear than any we presently have<br />\nof the communists.<br />\n<br />\ngreat development, students fear<br />\nthe less of identity, and they also<br />\nlose contact with faculty members who are engaged in so wide<br />\na variety of activities. \"And<br />\nstudents think they see a gap<br />\nbetween what higher education<br />\nsays and what it does.\"<br />\nFurther, students \"often do<br />\nnot understand ... why the institutions of higher learning do<br />\nnot lead in the crusade for social<br />\njustice.

And he<br />\nfeels that \"the college students<br />\nof today, rather than being<br />\nmerely restless or rootless, may<br />\nbe the first generation of New<br />\nAmericans\u2014compassionate, courageous, committed and involved.\"<br />\nIn order to understand the<br />\nrelevance of Dr. Eisenhower's<br />\ncomments to \"university reform,\"<br />\nit would seem that it is necessary first to recognize that university reform may be approached on two levels. First, it<br />\nmay be taken to comprehend<br />\nmatters which lie only within the<br />\nacademic realm\u2014what goes on<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nstrictly within the university<br />\ncommunity. Also, it may be understood to apply to that peculiar and perhaps unique relation a university maintains with<br />\nthe rest of society. If Dr. Eisenhower's foregoing commentary<br />\nhas any relation to the question<br />\nof university reform, such relation is to the latter facet that<br />\nthis viewer has outlined. The<br />\ncritical question facing American<br />\nuniversities in their attempts to<br />\nfind the proper relation with the<br />\n\"real world\" is one of determining exactly where on the continuum of absolute isolation and<br />\ntotal involvement each institution is to stand.

Hopkins is located in<br />\nthe 3rd council district, which<br />\nIs one of the crucial districts in<br />\nOle vote.<br />\nThe group decided on several<br />\nmeasures. Letter-writing campaigns and demonstrations are<br />\nto be organized. In addition, they<br />\ndecided to urge their own<br />\nechooi administrations to aninounce publicly their support of<br />\nthe bill.

Looking<br />\nto<br />\nparison<br />\nturther ahead, Carter asserted<br />\nthat someday Negroes will be<br />\nthe majority group in the city's<br />\npoint<br />\nwhich<br />\npopulation, at<br />\nclosed occupancy could keep the<br />\nWhite out.<br />\nBasically the act provides<br />\nthat: it shall be illegal because<br />\nof race, color, religion, ancestry<br />\nOr national origin, to deny an<br />\nequal opportunity to purchase.<br />\nSell, lease, sub lease, rent, assign<br />\nOr otherwise transfer or refuse<br />\nto negotiate on any of these matters or to represent that such<br />\nproperty is not available for inspection when it is so available.<br />\nhe proposed exemptions are:<br />\nhe rental of an apartment in a<br />\ntwo family dwelling where the<br />\nOwner occupies one apartment,<br />\nand the rental of a room in a<br />\nprivate dwelling.<br /><br />\nstudents and employees and for<br />\npossible faculty members who<br />\nmight be more likely to come<br />\nhere if housing were available.<br />\nSecond, it might prevent the<br />\ndevelopment of a Negro ghetto<br />\naround the campus. The ghetto<br />\nhas been pushing slowly out<br />\nfrom oenter city and has crossed<br />\nNorth Avenue, reaching as far<br />\nas 29th and 30th Streets, not<br />\nfar east of Hopkins. Other unihave found<br />\nversities which<br />\nthemselves surrounded by slums<br />\nhave felt that they had to develop urban renewal projects in<br />\ntheir neighborhoods. That problem may be avoided here if the<br />\nopen occupancy bill is passed.<br /><br />\nThe renovations of Mergenthaler Hall will provide a laboratory for the research of Dr.<br />\nSaul Roseman, a new professor<br />\nof biology. In addition, teaching<br />\nlaboratories for students are<br />\nbeing constructed above the<br />\nnew research lab.<br /><br />\nDr. Roseman came to Hopkins<br />\nthis year from the University of<br />\nMichigan, where he taught for<br />\ntwelve years. He is doing research in biochemistry under a<br />\ngrant from the National Institutes of Health. The money for<br />\nthe quarter million construction<br />\nproject comes from this grant<br />\nand the University.<br />\nThe laboratory is being converted from the first floor of<br />\nthe old biology library, which<br />\nis on the fourth floor of Mer-<br /><br />\ngenthaler. Because the library<br />\nhad no faciiltes, the conversion<br />\nhas necessitated the running of<br />\nthe facilities up from the basement through the lower floors.<br />\nSome 250 holes have been drilled<br />\nthrough the floors. The fifth<br />\nfloor's floor, which holds the<br />\nstudent labs, had to be raised<br />\n18 inches, because the library<br />\nstacks had been set lower than<br />\nthe rest of the floor.<br />\nNew Labs<br />\nThe labs occupy almost the<br />\nentire south end of the building. Both labs will be centrally<br />\nair-conditioned. Dr. Roseman<br />\ndescribes the lab as a standard<br />\nbiochemistry lab with a cold<br />\nroom, isotope equipment, and<br />\nlots-of hoods. According to Mr.<br />\nJohn Winter, executive officer<br />\nof the department of biology,<br />\nthe new lab will have \"absolute-<br /><br />\nly top rate equipment\". The student laboratories, which will be<br />\nused by both graduate and undergraduate classes, will consist<br />\nof two instrument rooms, and a<br />\npreparation room adjoining a<br />\nlarge laboratory. Dr. Roseman<br />\nhopes the conversion will be<br />\ncompleted by May 1.<br />\nDr. Roseman's laboratory will<br />\naccommodate twelve associates<br />\nto aid him with the project.

He has been attractively<br />\nirresponsible, but not significantly so, identified mainly<br />\nby his age group between maturity and adolescence,<br />\nmore concerned with graceful growth into careerhood<br />\nand adaptability than with questioning the effectiveness<br />\nof his education.<br /><br />\nWhat in the nature of the student, or in the nature<br />\nof the world has led students to go about the unheard<br />\n. of business questioning authority and policy of the wincational system?<br />\nAn acceptable explanation is given in that students<br />\ntoo longer need to bite their toenails or burn Christmas<br />\ntrees to express their distress with the established order.<br />\nCivil Rights anti its growing acceptability, tutorial<br />\nprojects, active and widespread dissent against existing<br />\ngovernment policy have !ended a legitimacy and a popularity to student agitation through extra-curricular protest. While fighting for the rights of the urban depressed,<br />\nthe students have come to some conclusions about their<br />\nown rights, drawing parallels from the bureaucratic<br />\npolitician to their own bureaucratic administrator.<br />\nThe student revolt is much more, however, than a<br />\nturn from apathy to agitation. The universities themselves have made significant changes in direction; they<br />\nhave expanded into more diverse and immense operations. Vi hile providing greater opportunities for the student, and thus deferring to increased capabilities of the<br />\n, students, it has, simultaneuosly, depersonalized the university, rendering the student even more of an object<br />\nof an educational system. The university is no longer<br />\nmerely in loco parentis but is a mechanization of educalion, an absentee and inflexible landlord.<br />\nWe are not to say that increased mechanization<br />\nmid diversity (the combination of which is known as<br />\nmultiversity) is unreservedly bad, or even to say, that<br />\nif such a thing is bad, that there are not exceptions.<br />\nBut we are to say that with greater complexity, the university can easily over-extend itself and lose sight of<br />\nthe student for all the education that stands in the way.<br />\nThere are indications at Hopkins, that obligations<br />\nto the non-academic community occasionally take precedence over the fulfillment of its academic creed. It is<br />\nnot uncommon for such a university to become inflexible in regards to social issues, over-sensitive to its<br />\nimage, entirely too formal and structured, in fact a<br />\nmass of outstretched tentacles, tangled and tied to extraimiversity dependencies.<br />\nNor is it uncommon for the student to take exireption to such a state of affairs. The university, with<br />\na broader field of interest, unavoidably infects the student with greater dimensions of thought and greater<br />\nconsciousness of social and political issues,<br />\nIf for no other reason than mere exposure, the<br />\nistudent is prompted to make judgments in and about<br />\nthe university and to take action consistent with his conscience; and while the university can not afford to heed<br />\nits conscience on such issues, the student will have it<br />\nno other way. In frustration, the student resents that<br />\nthe University, intended to he an arena for experiencing<br />\nand acting on the world, is but a funnel through which<br />\nshe world is channeled through education to act on him.<br />\n,<br />\n'<br />\nThe administrative officials, then, often take the rap<br />\nfrom the more agitated of the students' consciences, not<br />\nonly because the university has failed to live up to the<br />\nstudents' standards within and without the university,<br />\nbut also because the university itself has triggered the<br />\nreaction.<br />\nL.<br /><br />\nKOPER<br /><br />\nSICILIA<br /><br />\nELI ERY<br /><br />\nships, and extracurricular activities themselves should on the<br />\nmost part, be determined, at<br />\nleast, with a committee of faculty and a committee of students. In other words, an interaction is what I think should<br />\ndevelop, rather than exactly a<br />\none-sided education. Also, I<br />\nthink as far as Hopkins goes, to<br />\nspecify it a little bit, right now<br />\nseveral ad hoc groups are being<br />\nformed by the faculty. These<br />\ngroups have no permanence and<br />\nthey're actually selected by the<br />\nfaculty. They aren't put up to<br />\nstudent recognition, even of the<br />\nfact that there are such groups<br />\nand I think the students should<br />\nhave something to do with this.<br /><br />\nI think a greater rote 44<br />\nawareness and reception on the<br />\npart of the administration which<br />\nat first may sound like less disSandy Cohn, Junior<br />\ncipline', but in reality result its<br />\nWhat in your personal opinion<br />\nmore discipline and less freedom<br />\nis the significance of the term<br />\nwould, if put in the right direc\"university reform\"?<br />\ntion actually be a greater beneUniversity reform, rather than<br />\nfit to the university and the stu\"reforming a university\" I' think<br />\ndents.<br />\nwould imply more of a student<br />\nDo you think that the stsparticipation than in extracurdents themselves are Matura<br />\nricular activities, in determining<br />\nenough to accept the responsicurricular activities, studentbility in determining the policy<br />\nfaculty-relationships, something<br />\nof the university, and do you<br />\nlike this.<br />\nfeel students should by rights<br />\nTo what extent do you believe<br />\nparticipate in decisions effecting<br />\nstudent participation determine<br />\nthemselves?<br />\nuniversity policy, to what extent<br />\nWell, as regards to the first<br />\ncan this be applied to Hopkins<br />\npart of the question, I think that<br />\nand in what form?<br />\nmost of the students are capable<br />\nWell, I think to generalize the<br />\nof making decisions which affect<br />\nquestion, you have to say to<br />\nthemselves, but I think by far<br />\nwhat extent can it apply to any<br />\nthat most of the students probEvans Hays, sophomore.<br />\nuniversity, and<br />\nacademically,<br />\nably wouldn't have the niformaWhat does the term university<br />\nI'm not quite sure whether the<br />\ntion or the ability, or perhaps<br />\nreform<br />\nmean<br />\nto<br />\nyou regarding<br />\nstudents are educated enough to<br />\neven<br />\nthe desire to set up rules<br />\nthe<br />\nthesis that students should<br />\ndetermine their own curriculum<br />\nparticipate more in forming which would effect them, at<br />\nin a generalized manner.<br />\nleast all of the rules.

This procedure certainly has<br />\nbeen an affront against democracy. For years, the courts have<br />\nfelt that this problem was a<br />\npolitical one and refused tct take<br />\naction. In 1962, in the case<br />\nBaker v. Carr, the Supreme<br />\nCourt by a vote of 6 to 2 entered the field and demanded<br />\nthat the popularly elected house<br />\nof the state legislature be apportioned so that each man's vote<br />\nwould be equal. The decision's<br />\nIntent was to promote justice,<br />\nbut instead it opened a Pandora's<br />\nbox.<br /><br />\nfederal innovation. It was patterned after the New Jersey Plan<br />\noffered at the Constitutional<br />\nConvention by William Paterson, whose home state had used<br />\nthe Senate since 1764. Chief<br />\nJustice Warren goes on to deny<br />\nthe possibility of the retention<br />\nof the Senate even if the state<br />\nvoted by referendum to retain<br />\nit. He backs this contention up<br />\nby the 14th Amendment. Justice<br />\nJohn Harlan, Tom C. Clark, and<br />\nPotter Stewart vigorously disagree with Warren and have<br />\nmade their opinions known.<br />\nBecause of this decision, Senator Dirksen introduced a Constitutional Amendment which<br />\nwould give the states the right<br />\nto maintain the Senate upon the<br />\npassage of a referendum every<br />\nten years. On August 4, 1965,<br />\nthe Amendment received 57 favored votes (29 Republicans, 18<br />\nSouthern Democrats, and 10<br />\nNorthern Democrats) and 39<br />\nnegative votes (33 Northern<br />\nDemocrats, 3 Southern Democrats, and 3 Republicans). This<br />\nwas 7 votes short of the necessary %rds. Had the vote taken<br />\nplace prior to 1964, it probably<br />\nwould have passed.<br />\nThe 3 Republicans to vote<br /><br />\nagainst the measure were Caleb<br />\nBoggs<br />\nDel.), Clifford Case<br />\n(N.J.), and Jacob Javits (N.Y.)<br />\nJavits had been wavering on the<br />\nIssue for months and at the last<br />\nminute intrOduced a substitute<br />\nbill which Dirksen found unsatisfactory. Senator Case felt that<br />\nthe \"one man, one vote\" decision would help the Republican<br />\nParty politically. He maintained<br />\nthat the heavy Democratic rural<br />\nareas in the South would lose<br />\nstrength to the more liberal and<br />\nRepublican cities. In the North,<br />\nhe felt that the rural Republicans would be forced to adjust<br />\nto the liberal needs of the cities,<br />\nand thereby would win more<br />\nstate-wide elections. His analysis<br />\nIs probably correct, but he fails<br />\nto consider principles of government beyond pragmatic politics.<br />\nActually the retention of the<br />\nSenate probably would work to<br />\nthe disadvantage of the Republican Party in the long run. In<br />\nrecent years for example, the<br />\nU. S. Senate has been much more<br />\nliberal than the House of Representatives.

When a college<br />\nor university\u2014as an institution\u2014<br />\nbecomes involved in controversial<br />\nsocial issues it compromises its<br />\nmission of universalizing and endangers its special freedom always to seek ultimate truth.<br />\nWhen an institution- gets into<br />\npolitics, politics inevitably gets<br />\ninto the institution .. .\"<br />\nDr. Eisenhower looks with<br />\nfavor upon the involvement of<br />\ncollege students in relevant issues of the day, \"so long as this<br />\nis an act of citizenship, not of<br />\nInstitutional representation.\"<br />\nWe are in need of a new breed<br />\nof men, he concludes, to cope<br />\nwith new problems which arise<br />\nfrom the very nature of the<br />\nworld we are building. And he<br />\nfeels that \"the college students<br />\nof today, rather than being<br />\nmerely restless or rootless, may<br />\nbe the first generation of New<br />\nAmericans\u2014compassionate, courageous, committed and involved.\"<br />\nIn order to understand the<br />\nrelevance of Dr. Eisenhower's<br />\ncomments to \"university reform,\"<br />\nit would seem that it is necessary first to recognize that university reform may be approached on two levels. First, it<br />\nmay be taken to comprehend<br />\nmatters which lie only within the<br />\nacademic realm\u2014what goes on<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nstrictly within the university<br />\ncommunity. Also, it may be understood to apply to that peculiar and perhaps unique relation a university maintains with<br />\nthe rest of society. If Dr. Eisenhower's foregoing commentary<br />\nhas any relation to the question<br />\nof university reform, such relation is to the latter facet that<br />\nthis viewer has outlined. The<br />\ncritical question facing American<br />\nuniversities in their attempts to<br />\nfind the proper relation with the<br />\n\"real world\" is one of determining exactly where on the continuum of absolute isolation and<br />\ntotal involvement each institution is to stand.
