The spirit of the- production is said to be accurately embodied in the fanciful title, .\"Have<br />\nYou Bean to Lima?\"<br />\n\u2022 In extenuation thereof, the informatidn is proffered that the scene<br />\nof the play is laid in Peru. It will<br />\ndiffer from the usual elaborate fantasia, for it will boast a plot that<br />\nis easily discernible to the naked<br />\neye. In spite of the fact that Flo<br />\nZiegfeld is said to have exhausted<br />\nthe field, the Club has accomplished<br />\nthe supposedly impossible, for the<br />\ncomedy will contain a number of<br />\nabsolutely original features: The<br />\ncommittee is outspoken in saying<br />\nthat the HOpkins' production will<br />\nsurpass any others seen lately in<br />\nBaltimore in this respect. The features will not be divulged before<br />\nthe time of the production, so \u2022 a<br />\npleasant surprise is awaiting the<br />\npeople who view the show during<br />\nthe week of March 17.<br />\nThe music will be amply cared<br />\nfor by J.

The words are<br />\nsnappy, having been contributed by<br />\nboth undergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudents. \"Tin-pan Alley\" has produced nothing to beat them, is the<br />\nclaim made by Club members.<br />\nThe production will be staged by<br />\nlast year's men, Hamburger and<br />\nSmallwood, who will leave for New<br />\nYork tomorrow to consult with<br />\nMario Badillo, '23, .of the Physioc<br />\nStudios, who will lend his expert<br />\nadvice to the Barnstormers' show's<br />\ncostuming and staging. The dancing and singing will have their special professional coaches, and Mr.<br />\nWalter Swindell, the Club's head<br />\ncoach, will supervise the entire production. The testing of the fifty<br />\ncandidates will start next week.<br />\nWith the artistic end of the work<br />\nso well cared for, the Business<br />\nStaff is having more than its share<br />\nof difficulties. At present preliminary details are being attended to<br />\nbut the nights for the various benefits have not been arranged as yet,<br />\nand this is where the'chief difficulty<br />\nlies. The only possible way \u2022 in<br />\nwhich to assure the Club a full attendance each night, hence financial<br />\nsuccess, is to give to various local<br />\norganizations benefit nights, and<br />\nnegotiations are under way with<br />\nseveral charities. As soon as a majority of these are completed successfully the last obstacle in the<br />\nway of a banner -production will<br />\nhave been removed, and the Club<br />\nwill be ready for the Johns Hopkins production, \"Have You Bean<br />\nto Lima?\" to go on the stage.<br />\n<br />\nNOTICE<br />\nAll undergraduates are to<br />\nmeet at the Barn at five<br />\no'clock this afternoon to see<br />\nthe team off.<br />\nBe There!<br />\n<br />\nPRICE 5 CENTS<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS MEETS POWERFUL<br />\nCORNELL MACHINE TOMORROW<br />\nVan Orman Will Use Large Squad at Ithica in<br />\n\u2022<br />\nEffort to Stem Red Tide<br />\nPROBABLE LINEUP TOMORROW<br />\nNo.<br />\n7<br />\n9- 3<br />\n5<br />\n22-23<br />\n14<br />\n13<br />\n11<br />\n15<br />\n6<br />\n1<br />\n10-27<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS<br />\nBerndt<br />\nCarter or Slowick<br />\nWclbcrt<br />\nCarr or Levy<br />\nBarton<br />\nMagill<br />\nRich<br />\n\u2022<br />\nTaylor<br />\nTurnbull<br />\nBonner<br />\nMaxwell or Almy<br />\n<br />\nL E<br />\nL T<br />\nL G<br />\nR G<br />\nR T<br />\nRE<br />\nQ B<br />\nL H<br />\nR H<br />\nF B<br />\n<br />\nCORNELL<br />\nBuckley<br />\nKearney<br />\nMorris<br />\nAsseld<br />\nBrean<br />\nSundstrom<br />\n\u2022<br />\nKneen<br />\nPfann<br />\nPatterson<br />\nRamsey<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCassidy<br />\n<br />\nFAMOUS PAINTINGS ADORN Coach Ray Van Orman will lead<br />\nWALLS OF GILMAN HALL a large squad of football players<br />\nThose by Sargent Probably Best<br />\nfrom Mount Royal Station at six<br />\nKnown<br />\no'clock this evening, , bound for<br />\nAlthough not generally realized<br />\nIthaca, where the Black and Blue<br />\nby the students, the Main Library<br />\nwill clash with the powerful Corof Gilman Hall contains several<br />\nnell eleven tomorrow afternoon.<br />\nmasterpieces of the portrait paintThe Big Red team is going to be<br />\ners' art, as well as many excellent<br />\na formidable opponent for the J.<br />\npictures of famous figures at this<br />\nH.'

Loyola's<br />\nsuperior weight was too much for<br />\nits -much lighter 'opponents, and<br />\ntime and again big\u2022chunks of yardage were gaMed through the line.<br />\nThe defeat was decisive, for the<br />\nfreshmen played raggedly throughout the whole game, except for<br />\ntimes when Brian made good gains<br />\nthrough the line, or Brown did<br />\nsome good tackling. The game was<br />\na short affair, the quarters lasting<br />\nonly eight minutes.<br />\nIn the first quarter Loyola kicked<br />\nto Hopkins' forty-yard line and<br />\nBrian brought it to midfield. Hopkins tried to gain through the line,<br />\nbut after several unsuccessful attempts, kicked to Loyola's 35-yard<br />\nline. With the ball in their possession for the first time, Loyola completed three - first downs, through<br />\nthe line, end-running and two very<br />\ngood passes. But the ball finally<br />\nlanded on Hopkins' 10-yard line,<br />\nwhen the whistle blew for the first<br />\nquarter.<br />\nIn the second quarter Loyola<br />\ntook the ball from the 10-yard line<br />\nand with a good forward made a<br />\ntouchdown. Hopkins then kicked<br />\nto Loyola's 25-yard line. Loyola<br />\nfumbled on their 40-yard line and<br />\nit was Hopkins' ball.

The spirit of the- production is said to be accurately embodied in the fanciful title, .\"Have<br />\nYou Bean to Lima?\"<br />\n\u2022 In extenuation thereof, the informatidn is proffered that the scene<br />\nof the play is laid in Peru. It will<br />\ndiffer from the usual elaborate fantasia, for it will boast a plot that<br />\nis easily discernible to the naked<br />\neye. In spite of the fact that Flo<br />\nZiegfeld is said to have exhausted<br />\nthe field, the Club has accomplished<br />\nthe supposedly impossible, for the<br />\ncomedy will contain a number of<br />\nabsolutely original features: The<br />\ncommittee is outspoken in saying<br />\nthat the HOpkins' production will<br />\nsurpass any others seen lately in<br />\nBaltimore in this respect. The features will not be divulged before<br />\nthe time of the production, so \u2022 a<br />\npleasant surprise is awaiting the<br />\npeople who view the show during<br />\nthe week of March 17.<br />\nThe music will be amply cared<br />\nfor by J. J. Sherr, '25, who has<br />\nbeen appointed to write the tunes<br />\nfor all lyrics used. The words are<br />\nsnappy, having been contributed by<br />\nboth undergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudents. \"Tin-pan Alley\" has produced nothing to beat them, is the<br />\nclaim made by Club members.<br />\nThe production will be staged by<br />\nlast year's men, Hamburger and<br />\nSmallwood, who will leave for New<br />\nYork tomorrow to consult with<br />\nMario Badillo, '23, .of the Physioc<br />\nStudios, who will lend his expert<br />\nadvice to the Barnstormers' show's<br />\ncostuming and staging. The dancing and singing will have their special professional coaches, and Mr.<br />\nWalter Swindell, the Club's head<br />\ncoach, will supervise the entire production. The testing of the fifty<br />\ncandidates will start next week.<br />\nWith the artistic end of the work<br />\nso well cared for, the Business<br />\nStaff is having more than its share<br />\nof difficulties. At present preliminary details are being attended to<br />\nbut the nights for the various benefits have not been arranged as yet,<br />\nand this is where the'chief difficulty<br />\nlies. The only possible way \u2022 in<br />\nwhich to assure the Club a full attendance each night, hence financial<br />\nsuccess, is to give to various local<br />\norganizations benefit nights, and<br />\nnegotiations are under way with<br />\nseveral charities. As soon as a majority of these are completed successfully the last obstacle in the<br />\nway of a banner -production will<br />\nhave been removed, and the Club<br />\nwill be ready for the Johns Hopkins production, \"Have You Bean<br />\nto Lima?\" to go on the stage.<br /><br />\nNOTICE<br />\nAll undergraduates are to<br />\nmeet at the Barn at five<br />\no'clock this afternoon to see<br />\nthe team off.<br />\nBe There!<br /><br />\nPRICE 5 CENTS<br /><br />\nHOPKINS MEETS POWERFUL<br />\nCORNELL MACHINE TOMORROW<br />\nVan Orman Will Use Large Squad at Ithica in<br />\n\u2022<br />\nEffort to Stem Red Tide<br />\nPROBABLE LINEUP TOMORROW<br />\nNo.<br />\n7<br />\n9- 3<br />\n5<br />\n22-23<br />\n14<br />\n13<br />\n11<br />\n15<br />\n6<br />\n1<br />\n10-27<br /><br />\nHOPKINS<br />\nBerndt<br />\nCarter or Slowick<br />\nWclbcrt<br />\nCarr or Levy<br />\nBarton<br />\nMagill<br />\nRich<br />\n\u2022<br />\nTaylor<br />\nTurnbull<br />\nBonner<br />\nMaxwell or Almy<br /><br />\nL E<br />\nL T<br />\nL G<br />\nR G<br />\nR T<br />\nRE<br />\nQ B<br />\nL H<br />\nR H<br />\nF B<br /><br />\nCORNELL<br />\nBuckley<br />\nKearney<br />\nMorris<br />\nAsseld<br />\nBrean<br />\nSundstrom<br />\n\u2022<br />\nKneen<br />\nPfann<br />\nPatterson<br />\nRamsey<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCassidy<br /><br />\nFAMOUS PAINTINGS ADORN Coach Ray Van Orman will lead<br />\nWALLS OF GILMAN HALL a large squad of football players<br />\nThose by Sargent Probably Best<br />\nfrom Mount Royal Station at six<br />\nKnown<br />\no'clock this evening, , bound for<br />\nAlthough not generally realized<br />\nIthaca, where the Black and Blue<br />\nby the students, the Main Library<br />\nwill clash with the powerful Corof Gilman Hall contains several<br />\nnell eleven tomorrow afternoon.<br />\nmasterpieces of the portrait paintThe Big Red team is going to be<br />\ners' art, as well as many excellent<br />\na formidable opponent for the J.<br />\npictures of famous figures at this<br />\nH.'

At this point<br />\nGough threw a forward, but it was<br />\nuncovered and O'Brennan, of Loyola, intercepted it, to run 50 yards<br />\nfor the second touchdown.
