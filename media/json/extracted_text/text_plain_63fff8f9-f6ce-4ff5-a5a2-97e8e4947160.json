To find out the answer to these<br />\nmomentous questions and have a good laugh at<br />\nthe same time, we suggest you travel over to the<br />\nbarn and see the Freshmen play Love Rides the<br />\nRails. This is an old-fashioned melodrama,<br />\nwhich features everything from a spitting duel,<br />\nto our heroine saving the railroad in her panties.<br />\nThe play, presented by the Barnstormers will<br />\nrun for two performances, tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m.<br />\nWondering what prompted such an unconventional choice, we talked with the President of<br />\nthe Barnstormers, Dennis Donahue.<br />\n\"We picked the play,\" said Dennis, who is<br />\nserving as a sort of produCtion \"maid of all<br />\n<br />\nIt wasn't too long ago that a candidate for the position<br />\nof freshman representative to the Student Council named<br />\nBob Clarke got 8 percent of the votes cast.

Reason; Mr. Clarke<br />\ndidn't exist.<br />\nHe had been run by the News-Letter; but no one<br />\nknew this.

There is no reason why Freshmen elections can't be pants displaying not only a complete toleration of, but also a<br />\nheld off until the beginning of the second semester. By genuine interest in, the views<br />\nof<br />\nthat time the Freshmen Spirit Committee will have had their fellow-students.

To find out the answer to these<br />\nmomentous questions and have a good laugh at<br />\nthe same time, we suggest you travel over to the<br />\nbarn and see the Freshmen play Love Rides the<br />\nRails. This is an old-fashioned melodrama,<br />\nwhich features everything from a spitting duel,<br />\nto our heroine saving the railroad in her panties.<br />\nThe play, presented by the Barnstormers will<br />\nrun for two performances, tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m.<br />\nWondering what prompted such an unconventional choice, we talked with the President of<br />\nthe Barnstormers, Dennis Donahue.<br />\n\"We picked the play,\" said Dennis, who is<br />\nserving as a sort of produCtion \"maid of all<br /><br />\nIt wasn't too long ago that a candidate for the position<br />\nof freshman representative to the Student Council named<br />\nBob Clarke got 8 percent of the votes cast.

Reason; Mr. Clarke<br />\ndidn't exist.<br />\nHe had been run by the News-Letter; but no one<br />\nknew this.
