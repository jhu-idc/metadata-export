An outraged populace, ruthlessly taking hostages, occasionaly brandishing knives at their throats, yet, for the<br />\nmost part, treating them with a strange kindness, almost as<br />\nif to show that they could rise above their situation; this is<br />\ncontrasted with a bumbling government which showed a<br />\nfew days of enlightened activity before resorting to the<br />\nmore conventional, if somewhat dehumanizing, method of<br />\nrestoring order in a \"corrections\" institution. The officals'.<br />\nside was highlighted by Governor Rockcfeller's stern belief that if he just buried his head in the Albany cement,<br />\nthe whole thing would go away.<br />\nAs long as our prisons take persons who have, for the<br />\nmost part, received the worst society has to offer, and<br />\nshow these people that there is a way of life even lower<br />\ndown on the scale, then Atticas will continue to rise.<br />\n<br />\nThe cuckoo's nest<br />\nInstitutions that gather up the misfits and outcasts of<br />\nour society are almost inevitably places of horror that the<br />\nrest of us would prefer to ignore. There, behind the walls<br />\nor bars, varied tortures of bodies and souls can take place<br />\nat a comfortable distance. Occasionally, through riots or<br />\nGrand Jury investigations or newspaper stories, we are<br />\nbriefly reminded of what actually is happening to those we<br />\nwish to forget. We see this again in the story in this issue<br />\nabout a University of Maryland co-ed who was<br />\ninvoluntarily committed to a state mental hospital; it is<br />\nanother example of institutional terror. There is a need for<br />\ndrastic change in both the law that made her commitment<br />\npossible and in the system of mental hospitals. Ken<br />\nKesey's \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" remains,<br />\nunfortunately, more than just a work of fiction.<br />\nThe 0E0-backed Legal Aid Bureau is challenging the<br />\ninvoluntary civil commitment law before a Federal court<br />\npanel. Practically no constitutional safeguards are available<br />\nto a victim of the law\u2014and there are hundreds of them.<br />\nFor them, there are no lawyers and no hearings, just the<br />\ncertificate of two paid state doctors. Pressure needs to be<br />\napplied on the state legislature so that this abhorrent law is<br />\nstricken from the books.<br />\nMost important, of course, is the desperate need for<br />\nan overhaul of mental hospitals. For too long, we have<br />\nknown that there are many who do not belong there and<br />\nthat the hospitals are failing miserably in curing the<br />\nmentally ill. Overcrowding, low staff, backward methods<br />\nand sheer cruelty make our society's treatment of the<br />\nmentally ill only a slight improvement over the Middle<br />\nAges.<br />\n<br />\nSept. 17, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI read with amazed interest<br />\nWarren Gulin's piece on<br />\nSha-na-na's Saturday night<br />\nconcert.

Certainly all men at<br />\nHopkins, being steeped in<br />\nawareness and social conscience,<br />\nmust needs be moved to the<br />\ndeepest recesses of their<br />\ntormented souls by this stunning<br />\narticle, an article that<br />\nexcruciatingly' elucidates the<br />\nreprehensibility and<br />\nabomination of deriving pleasure<br />\nfrom laughing and reminiscing to<br />\nthe music of our young<br />\ninnocence. It is a light in the<br />\ndarkness for those of us who are<br />\ntoo crass to comprehend that we<br />\nare being duped by irresponsible<br />\nmerchants of derision who can<br />\nonly cater to our basest instincts<br />\nand crudest emotions.

The Phi<br />\nBeta Kappa Society was founded at the College<br />\nof William and Mary in 1776. The Hopkins chapter was chartered in 1895. Over the nearly two<br />\nhundred years since its founding, this society has<br />\nbecome primarily honorary. It honors excellent<br />\nacademic achievement in liberal studies, broadly<br />\ndefined. All candidates of either sex for the B.A.<br />\nand B.E.S. degrees at Hopkins who earn high<br />\ngrades are eligible to be considered for \"membership.

Ultimately, it will be proven that<br />\nthe animals are not in there,<br />\nbut out here and that the animals are running the country.\"<br />\nThe speaker is Arthur 0.<br />\nEve, a New York state Assemblyman whose presence at Attica was requested by the rebellious prisoners.

Eve was in Baltimore yesterday answering<br />\nquestions on VVJZ's Black News<br />\nConference, a program that<br />\nwill be aired Sunday at noon.<br />\n\"I have said that Governor<br />\nRockefeller is guilty of murder<br />\nand should be charged with<br />\nthat crime.\" Eve was obviously<br />\ntired from his five-day ordeal,<br />\nbut he had set out on a crosscountry tour, \"to talk to anybody who wants to hear the<br />\ntruth.\"<br />\n\"I'll never know why the<br />\nGovernor would not come (to<br />\nAttica),\" the 38-year-old black<br />\nman from Buffalo said. He recalled enduring the attack lock -<br />\n<br />\ned in a room with ten other<br />\nmembers of the observers team<br />\ninside the prison walls. Eve related that as they watched the<br />\ndead being brought out, Tom<br />\nWicker broke down in tears,<br />\nsaying, \"I wish the governor<br />\nhad come.\"<br />\n\"All of us cried at one time<br />\nor another,\" Eve stated.<br />\nThe group, which varied in<br />\nsize from 10 to 20 members<br />\nhad spent the previous five<br />\ndays in frantic talks with the<br />\n1200 inmates in cell block D at<br />\nAttica. The inmates had their<br />\nown prisoners, 3<br />\n.7 guards and<br />\nprison employes, and were demanding a long list of reforms<br />\nas well as amnesty before the<br />\nmen would go free.<br />\nThe obervers had requested<br />\ntha Governor Rockefeller come<br />\nto Attica, not to meet with inmates, but to talk with their<br />\ncommittee on the seriousnesss<br />\nof the situation. If he didn't<br />\ncome, they predicted a slaughter.<br />\n\"A visit by the Governor<br />\nwas the key to the situation.<br />\nThe inmates cheered when we<br />\ntold them we were trying to<br />\nget him to come,\" Eve said, adding that he didn't believe a<br />\nlife would have been lost had<br />\nRockefeller come.<br />\nEve maintains that his committee was there only to observe and relay messages. \"We<br />\nwere never negotiators. We<br />\ncould not negotiate with their<br />\nlives.\"<br />\nThroughout the talks he had<br />\nwith the prisoners, Eve was impressed with the order he<br />\nfound in the<br />\nstockade. He reports that each<br />\ntime the committee went in,<br />\nit sat at a table<br />\nsurrounded by<br />\nthree lines of inmates. This<br />\ngroup protected<br />\nthe members of<br />\nthe committee<br />\nfrom harm. Eve<br />\nunderstands<br />\nthat the guards<br />\nwere Black Muslims.<br />\n\"The overall impression was<br />\none of solidarity and democracy,\" he says. \"They had re-<br />\n<br />\nspect for human life. The hos-.<br />\ntages slept on matresses while<br />\nthe prisoners had hard beds.<br />\nThe guards ate what the prisoners ate.\" Eve claims that during<br />\nthe attack, a prisoner fell on<br />\ntop of the hostage he was supposed to execute and was shot<br />\nand killed, saving the life of the<br />\nprison guard.<br />\nEve did not find the same respect for humanity outside of<br />\nthe prison walls. \"The Governor doesn't value human life<br />\nenough to take a 30 minute<br />\nplane ride.\"<br />\nEve claims that prison officials put the lives of the observers in danger by telling the inmates that the committee had<br />\nagreed that the hostages should<br />\nbe set free and negotiations<br />\nshould continue on neutral<br />\ngrounds, when actually the<br />\ngroup had made no such agreement. \"Some of them were<br />\nready to kill us when we went<br />\nback in there, but they could<br />\ntell that we were sincere.\"<br />\nThe state Assemblyman<br />\nclaims that the officials were<br />\nwilling to risk the lives of the<br />\nobservers to get an excuse for<br />\nstorming the prison.<br />\n\"They<br />\ndidn't<br />\neven care<br />\nabout their own guards,\" he<br />\nsays, adding that this did not<br />\nsurprise the prisoners because,<br />\n\"They understood the political<br />\nsystem better than I ever<br />\nhave.\"<br />\nAll of the guards at Attica<br />\nare white, while over 80 percent of the prisoners are black<br />\nor Puerto Rican. One of the demands of the rebels was a<br />\nSpanish interpreter in the prison medical center.<br />\n\"The guards<br />\nhad no training,<br />\ntraining that<br />\nthey had requested.

If<br />\nhe should appoint someone, I<br />\nwouldn't know whether to believe him or not.\"<br />\nReferring to many reports<br />\nthat were given out by state<br />\nspokesmen during the -five<br />\ndays, Eve called them \"fantastic lies.\"<br />\nEve claimed that one early<br />\nreport about a guard dying<br />\nfrom injuries after being<br />\nthrown out of a second -story<br />\nwindow could not be true,<br />\nsince all windows at Attica are<br />\nbarred.<br />\nEve can only shake his head<br />\nwhen he remembers the sincerity of the inmates and the<br />\nhostility and untruthfulness of<br />\nthe prison officials.

It's been available, of<br />\ncourse, for quite a while now;<br />\nbut that's alright. She gave us a<br />\nlong time to consider it.<br />\nIt seems that when somebody<br />\nwho makes fnusic dies abruptly,<br />\nhis music stops dead in time and<br />\nis no longer vulnerable to fads or<br />\nto the fickle preferences of<br />\nwhoever listens and supposedly<br />\nknows at at any given time.<br />\nAccordingly the music of<br />\nMorrison, of Hendrix, of<br />\nRedding (posthumous released<br />\nnotwithstanding) is frozen. It<br />\nwill not evolve or change or<br />\nshow the influence of anything<br />\nor anybody anymore, because he<br />\ncan no longer reveal to those of<br />\nus still here what is evolving,<br />\nchanging, or influencing him<br />\nnow. So it goes, of course, whth<br />\nJanis Joplin; and you will<br />\nunderstnad why this particular<br />\n<br />\nreview of Pearl comes later than<br />\nmost. Her next release can't<br />\nspoil anything I say about her.<br />\nSo it does go.<br />\nThere's a good chance you<br />\nalready have Pearl. If so, there's<br />\nan even greater chance that it's<br />\nworn nearly smooth by now.<br />\nBut if you're cheap like me and<br />\nyou haven't even gotten around<br />\nto getting a copy of Cheap<br />\nThrills yet, maybe you're a little<br />\ninterested in reading a- little<br />\nabout Pearl and a little about<br />\nJanis Joplin. Maybe you're not. I<br />\ndon't care. Neither would she,<br />\nI'll bet.<br />\nI saw her perform once before<br />\nshe died, which makes me a<br />\ncelebrity. It was at the Atlantic<br />\nCity Race Track three weeks<br />\nbefore Woodstock. If you can't<br />\nremember back that far,<br />\nimmediately, try to recall the<br />\ntime in your life when the<br />\nOfficial Decoder Hand Signal<br />\n<br />\nJanis Joplin<br />\n<br />\nwas index and middle fingers<br />\nextended. Well, I had shimmied<br />\nup a huge pipe that ran along the<br />\nunderside of the gradstand roof<br />\nSO I could see the show and<br />\neverybody else watching. A<br />\npretty good idea, I thought,<br />\nuntil I nearly fell from my lofty<br />\nperch trying mentally to TAKE<br />\nIT during \"Piece of my Heart.\"<br />\nA grisly death it would have<br />\nbeen, to have been impaled upon<br />\nthousands of punji-stick fingers,<br />\nraised frenziedly skyward.<br />\nA lot of the wailing on Pearl is<br />\nthe same Janis Joplin I saw then.<br />\nYou know. Driving, raw<br />\nscreaming, taste-of-blood-in-the-mouth sex. And, of course, it's<br />\ntremendous. There is a laugh<br />\nsomewhere on the album that<br />\nmay sound to you like a witch,<br />\nbut it sounds to me like a<br />\ntwenty-three year old white<br />\ntrash girl who got it when she<br />\nwas eleven for the first time<br />\n<br />\nfrom Uncle Harold and her life's<br />\nbeen downhill ever since. That<br />\nlaugh says a lot.<br />\nThere is one more thing on<br />\nthis particular album that says a<br />\nlot that I must mention. It is the<br />\nthing I have ever heard on a<br />\nrecording. It makes me sad<br />\nwhenever I hear it. It is when<br />\nJanis Joplin yells,\"Everybody!\"<br />\nduring \"Mercedes Benz\" and<br />\nthen when she sings the next<br />\nchorus it's still just her voice,<br />\ncompletely alone.<br />\nJanis Joplin sang the blues.<br />\nShe sang them loud and she sang<br />\nthem soft. She wasn't musically<br />\nperfect; she wasn't the Beatles.<br />\nThat is, she couldn't sound like<br />\nanything or anybody or any<br />\nfeeling imaginable. But she could<br />\nsing the blues, and she could sing<br />\nthem better than any bitch you<br />\never stepped out on.<br />\n<br />\n\fSept'. 17, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 8<br />\n<br />\nFlight Over Maryland's Cuckoo's Nest.<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\nresult of a legal mix-up.

There was a little tiny window in the door, and<br />\nthere was no door handle on the<br />\ninside. There was a light way up<br />\non the ceiling, and there was no<br />\nwindowsill.

In comparing<br />\nthe current squad to last year's<br />\n5-4 second place outfit, Cox<br />\nobserved that \"We've got a lot<br />\nmore cohesion this year and<br />\nseem to have more enthusiasm.<br />\nThere is a healthy competition;<br />\neach player must learn two<br />\npositions, so there's less<br />\nspecialization and more unity.\"<br />\nHopkins' new coach has<br />\ndeclined as yet to name a<br />\ntentative starting lineup and<br />\ninstead plans to wait until after<br />\ntomorrow's scrimmage at<br />\nLebanon Valley to do so. Cox,<br />\nhowever, did make note of<br />\nseveral \"interesting battles\" for<br />\nstarting assignments that will<br />\nhave to be resolved.<br />\nJunior Tim Weglicki, an<br />\noutstanding performer last year,<br />\nis in danger of losing his split<br />\n'end post to upstart Grant<br />\nShevchik. With Weglicki having<br />\nmissed three days of practice<br />\nfrom an injury, Shevchik,<br />\nappearing \"the best he's ever<br />\nlooked at Hopkins,\" seems to<br />\nhave the upper hand.<br />\nSophomores Mike Bogdan and<br />\nRick Kowalchuk are fighting for<br />\nthe tight end spot. A hurt<br />\nshoulder sidelined the latter for<br />\nthree days, but \"a very good<br />\n<br />\ngame in last Saturday's<br />\nscrimmage\" has put Kowalchuk<br />\nback in the thick of<br />\ncompetition. Keith Krantz and<br />\nMike O'Brien are locked in \"a<br />\nheated battle\" for the nod at<br />\ndefensive tackle.<br />\nThe quarterback situation is<br />\ntaking shape but as yet remains<br />\nunsettled. With junior John<br />\nShanahan having lost five days<br />\nwith a leg injury and freshman<br />\nRick Kramer only having<br />\npracticed with the team for a<br />\nweek, sophomore Jack Thomas<br />\nhas been getting most of the<br />\nwork at this key position.<br />\nSophomore Pat Cameron<br />\nsustained a knee injury and will<br />\nbe lost to the team indefinitely.<br />\nThe rest of the offensive<br />\n'backfield appears to feature<br />\nboth talent and depth. Captain<br />\nButch Robey, a defensive back<br />\nhalf of last season, and Jim<br />\nFerguson, a converted defensive<br />\nlineman, have been impressive<br />\ncarrying the ball. The pair is<br />\ncomplemented by last year's<br />\nsteady performer Pat Neary and<br />\nGarry Stringer.<br />\nCox concedes that the<br />\nquestion of the offensive line<br />\nholds the key to the success of<br />\nthe running game. Although he<br />\nlauded Sam Pahnisano for an<br />\n\"outstanding job\" at center, he<br />\npainfully pointed to tackle Jim<br />\nAdams' shoulder injury as \"a big<br />\nsetback.\" Adams will be<br />\nsidelined for three weeks, after<br />\n<br />\nwhich Cox hopes \"he will pick<br />\nup whe-re he left off:Meanwhile, the line \"needs an<br />\nawful lot of work at offensive<br />\ntackle; it's up for grabs.\"<br />\nThe twenty-one freshmen<br />\nwho have tried out for the team<br />\nhave been enthusiastically hailed<br />\nby Cox as \"doing an excellent<br />\njob.\" Inasmuch as none were<br />\nspecifically recruited, they<br />\nrepresent a real \"bumper crop\"<br />\nthat promises to add \"ability<br />\nand depth\" to the squad. Curtis<br />\nJohnson has shown a lot of<br />\npotential at offensive tackle and<br />\ndefensive end; both Jack Coulter<br />\nand Manuel Hernandez were<br />\npraised at defensive back as<br />\n\"very promising.\"<br />\nThe defense appears able to<br />\n\"contain the outside running<br />\ngame,\" but the secondary might<br />\nbe another story. \"The pass<br />\ndefense is difficult, but coming<br />\nalong,\" Cox remarked. \"It's not<br />\nup to what I'd like it to be, but<br />\nit will continue to develop.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays open the season<br />\nSeptember, 27 against a strong<br />\nteam from Muhlenberg. When<br />\nquestioned about his feelings<br />\ntoward the game and the MAC<br />\ntitle race, Cox replied,'\"My first<br />\nthought is that I want to be 1-0.<br />\nMy second thought is that I<br />\nwant to improve on last year's<br />\nrecord, and my third is that<br />\nwant to win the league<br />\nchampionship.\"<br />\n<br />\nSports Shorts Potpourri Frosh Recruits Aid<br />\n'By BRUCE BORTZ<br />\nHopkins' inter-collegiate fall<br />\nseason begins in earnest on<br />\nSeptember 25t1l, eight days from<br />\nnow and anywhere from one to<br />\ntwo weeks behind a great many<br />\ncolleges and universities across<br />\nthe country.<br />\nWhile these pages have<br />\nfocused until now on fall sports,<br />\nnamely football, soccer and<br />\ncross-country, a number of<br />\nsignificant things have already<br />\noccurred relative to winter and<br />\nspring sports at Hopkins that<br />\ndeserve note.<br />\nLoveland New Coach<br />\nFirst off, Joe Loveland, last<br />\nyear's star forward for Hopkins'<br />\nbasketball five, will replace Bill<br />\nGaertner as freshmen basketball<br />\ncoach. Gaertner left for a<br />\nposition at the University of<br />\nConnecticut. According to<br />\nLoveland, there remains some<br />\nconfusion as to whether this<br />\nteam will be a \"freshman\"team<br />\nor a \"junior varsity\" team.<br />\nLacrosse Interchange<br />\nFar more certain of its<br />\nprogram is this year's Blue Jay<br />\nLacrosse team. Its 1972 setup<br />\nwill definitely include a junior<br />\nvarsity team and a varsity team<br />\n<br />\nwith an interchange of personnel<br />\npermitted between the two<br />\nteams from one week to the<br />\nnext. Coach Robert Scott, of<br />\ncourse, would have been<br />\njumping with delight with such<br />\nan arrangement last year.<br />\nNew Plastic Sticks Introduced<br />\nOne other lacrosse<br />\ndevelopment promises to have<br />\nmore far reaching an effect on<br />\nHopkins' lacrosse and on the<br />\ngame in general. Plastic sticks<br />\n(plastic only inside of and<br />\naround the net) made their first<br />\nippearance on the lacrosse field<br />\nthis past spring. In fact, by<br />\nseason's end, a great many<br />\nplayers on the University of<br />\nVirginia's team were using these<br />\nnew, somewhat lighter, sticks.<br />\nAttackmen, middies, and even<br />\ngoalies playing in leagues in the<br />\nBaltimore area began to use<br />\nthem en masse this summer.<br />\nJunior Eddie Levin, a member<br />\nof last Year's lacrosse team at<br />\nHopkins, offered several reasons<br />\nfor the sudden proliferation of<br />\nthe new-fangled sticks. \"The old<br />\nwooden stick often took days,<br />\neven weeks to break in. The<br />\nplastic stick can be broken in in<br />\njust 15 minutes or so. What's<br />\n<br />\nmore, when you throw with the<br />\nplastic stick, the ball conies out<br />\nthe same way each time.\"<br />\nNew Sticks More Expensive<br />\nThe new stick is still in its<br />\ninfancy. Manufactured by a<br />\nBaltimore firm, the STX, as it is<br />\ncalled, presently costs about a<br />\nthird more than wooden sticks<br />\n(approximately $24 as compared<br />\nwith $15 or $16).<br />\nWith time, the price of the<br />\nsticks is sure to come down.<br />\nDespite its present expense, the<br />\nplastic stick unquestionably, will<br />\nbe present in large quantities on<br />\nmost collegiate teams by spring.<br />\nIt may well bring with it better<br />\nstick handling, better passing,<br />\nand more offense, as well as<br />\nsome added color, as the sticks<br />\nare being put out in assorted<br />\nthades.<br />\nThose wanting to see the new<br />\nsticks in action need only visit<br />\nthe field midway between<br />\nGarland Hall and the parking lot<br />\nMondays and Wednesdays. Fall<br />\nlacrosse practice, under the<br />\nwatchful eye of Coach Mike<br />\nHanna, lacrosse star at Hobart<br />\nsome years ago, began this past<br />\nWednesday.<br />\nFootball Here To Stay<br />\nFinally, this note comes from<br />\nfootball coach, Dennis Cox. The<br />\ncoach is confident that football<br />\nwill remain at Hopkins for some<br />\ntime to come. He pointed out<br />\nthat the study made last spring<br />\nevaluating football's place in the<br />\nathletic program at Hopkins was<br />\nvery thorough, and searching.<br />\nThe study saw football as an<br />\nextremely beneficial experience<br />\nfor those who play, the coach<br />\nadded.<br />\n<br />\nThinclads' Outlook<br />\n<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nFor Ed Cummings, Phil<br />\nGalagher and Russ Dubiel,<br />\ncross-country practice has<br />\nbecome a daily routine,<br />\nhighlighted by a tiring eight to<br />\nten miles of running each<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nYet, in spite of the strenuous<br />\nnature of this activity, very<br />\nrarely do its participants get the<br />\npublicity and acknowledgement<br />\ngranted to members of other fall<br />\nsports. As co-captain Ed<br />\nCummings stated, \"Sometimes<br />\nwe have very little reason to<br />\nkeep on running, except maybe<br />\nto increase our own satisfaction<br />\nand pride.\"<br />\nFor the last three seasons, this<br />\nfeeling of ; self-satisfaction has<br />\nsometimes been the only thing<br />\nto be gained from running<br />\ncross-country. Occasionally,<br />\nlosing became such a depressing<br />\nexperience for the runners that<br />\nthey showed up for practice<br />\nonly to keep the cross-country<br />\nteam in existence for another<br />\nyear.<br />\nYet, the three top runners on<br />\nthe team this year, namely,<br />\n<br />\ndummings, Galagher and Dubiel,<br />\nfeel that this season will be<br />\ndifferent. According to these<br />\nrunners, there is an entirely<br />\ndifferent feeling on the team this<br />\nyear - one of eagerness,<br />\ncompetitive desire and spirit.<br />\nAll three men attribute this<br />\nnew attitude to the presence of<br />\nfreshmen recruits on the varsity<br />\nteam this year. As Cummings<br />\nsummarized it, \"Their presence<br />\nadds a lot to the team; now we<br />\nalways have to do our best, to<br />\nkeep someone else from taking<br />\nour job away.\"<br />\nRuss Dubiel, a top sophomore<br />\nrunner who suffered through a<br />\nwinless season last year, also<br />\nnotices a change on the team.<br />\nRuss feels that there is definitely<br />\nmore talent available, due to the<br />\nexcellent.off-season recruiting of<br />\ncoach Don Masken.<br />\nAs Coach Masken put it,<br />\n\"This year, for once, I have<br />\nseven or eight boys who I know<br />\ncan do the job right from the<br />\nstart.\" As of this moment, the<br />\nteam is running an average of<br />\n8-10 miles a day, and is in good<br />\nshape, with no serious injuries:<br />\n<br />\nWELCOME ABOARD!<br />\nSCHOOL OPENING SPECIALS:<br />\n** CA NNON-TL-QL 450 innt 1.8 lens<br />\nCase and 135 mm<br />\n2.8 Auto Lens<br />\n<br />\n!S199.50<br />\n<br />\n\"NIKKORMAT-w/ 50mm 2.0 Auto Lens Case and 135mm<br />\n2.8 Auto Lens<br />\n<br />\nS289.50<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\nPfioto<br />\n<br />\n3011 GREEN MOUNT AVENUE<br />\n<br />\n\fSept. 17, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 11<br />\n<br />\nTransfer Enrollment Falls<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital<br />\n<br />\nby daniel epstein<br />\n<br />\nAllied Health School<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\nradiology facilities with twice<br />\nthe present capacity be set up,<br />\nthat new private patient beds be<br />\nobtained, that a new obstetrical<br />\narea be established, and that the<br />\nPhipps psychiatric clinic be<br />\nrenovated.

An outraged populace, ruthlessly taking hostages, occasionaly brandishing knives at their throats, yet, for the<br />\nmost part, treating them with a strange kindness, almost as<br />\nif to show that they could rise above their situation; this is<br />\ncontrasted with a bumbling government which showed a<br />\nfew days of enlightened activity before resorting to the<br />\nmore conventional, if somewhat dehumanizing, method of<br />\nrestoring order in a \"corrections\" institution. The officals'.<br />\nside was highlighted by Governor Rockcfeller's stern belief that if he just buried his head in the Albany cement,<br />\nthe whole thing would go away.<br />\nAs long as our prisons take persons who have, for the<br />\nmost part, received the worst society has to offer, and<br />\nshow these people that there is a way of life even lower<br />\ndown on the scale, then Atticas will continue to rise.<br /><br />\nThe cuckoo's nest<br />\nInstitutions that gather up the misfits and outcasts of<br />\nour society are almost inevitably places of horror that the<br />\nrest of us would prefer to ignore. There, behind the walls<br />\nor bars, varied tortures of bodies and souls can take place<br />\nat a comfortable distance. Occasionally, through riots or<br />\nGrand Jury investigations or newspaper stories, we are<br />\nbriefly reminded of what actually is happening to those we<br />\nwish to forget. We see this again in the story in this issue<br />\nabout a University of Maryland co-ed who was<br />\ninvoluntarily committed to a state mental hospital; it is<br />\nanother example of institutional terror. There is a need for<br />\ndrastic change in both the law that made her commitment<br />\npossible and in the system of mental hospitals. Ken<br />\nKesey's \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" remains,<br />\nunfortunately, more than just a work of fiction.<br />\nThe 0E0-backed Legal Aid Bureau is challenging the<br />\ninvoluntary civil commitment law before a Federal court<br />\npanel. Practically no constitutional safeguards are available<br />\nto a victim of the law\u2014and there are hundreds of them.<br />\nFor them, there are no lawyers and no hearings, just the<br />\ncertificate of two paid state doctors. Pressure needs to be<br />\napplied on the state legislature so that this abhorrent law is<br />\nstricken from the books.<br />\nMost important, of course, is the desperate need for<br />\nan overhaul of mental hospitals. For too long, we have<br />\nknown that there are many who do not belong there and<br />\nthat the hospitals are failing miserably in curing the<br />\nmentally ill. Overcrowding, low staff, backward methods<br />\nand sheer cruelty make our society's treatment of the<br />\nmentally ill only a slight improvement over the Middle<br />\nAges.<br /><br />\nSept. 17, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI read with amazed interest<br />\nWarren Gulin's piece on<br />\nSha-na-na's Saturday night<br />\nconcert.

Never has this<br />\nterrestrial citadel of inflated egos<br />\nand sophomoric intelligence<br />\nbeen so blessed with such a<br />\nsplendid virtuoso. I was agape,<br />\nexuberant, titillated and<br />\nrapturous to find such creative<br />\ngenius, such verbal perspicacity<br />\ncombined with a remarkably<br />\nacute sense of righteous<br /><br />\nindignation. Certainly all men at<br />\nHopkins, being steeped in<br />\nawareness and social conscience,<br />\nmust needs be moved to the<br />\ndeepest recesses of their<br />\ntormented souls by this stunning<br />\narticle, an article that<br />\nexcruciatingly' elucidates the<br />\nreprehensibility and<br />\nabomination of deriving pleasure<br />\nfrom laughing and reminiscing to<br />\nthe music of our young<br />\ninnocence. It is a light in the<br />\ndarkness for those of us who are<br />\ntoo crass to comprehend that we<br />\nare being duped by irresponsible<br />\nmerchants of derision who can<br />\nonly cater to our basest instincts<br />\nand crudest emotions.

The Phi<br />\nBeta Kappa Society was founded at the College<br />\nof William and Mary in 1776. The Hopkins chapter was chartered in 1895. Over the nearly two<br />\nhundred years since its founding, this society has<br />\nbecome primarily honorary. It honors excellent<br />\nacademic achievement in liberal studies, broadly<br />\ndefined. All candidates of either sex for the B.A.<br />\nand B.E.S. degrees at Hopkins who earn high<br />\ngrades are eligible to be considered for \"membership.

Its<br />\nfrantic fluttering had been ignored for so<br />\nlong that when<br />\nit finally succumbed, it<br />\ncoughed up so<br />\nmuch killing<br />\nand carnage that it makes our<br />\nstomachs turn.<br />\n\"We have treated these people like a herd of animals. Ultimately, it will be proven that<br />\nthe animals are not in there,<br />\nbut out here and that the animals are running the country.\"<br />\nThe speaker is Arthur 0.<br />\nEve, a New York state Assemblyman whose presence at Attica was requested by the rebellious prisoners.

Eve was in Baltimore yesterday answering<br />\nquestions on VVJZ's Black News<br />\nConference, a program that<br />\nwill be aired Sunday at noon.<br />\n\"I have said that Governor<br />\nRockefeller is guilty of murder<br />\nand should be charged with<br />\nthat crime.\" Eve was obviously<br />\ntired from his five-day ordeal,<br />\nbut he had set out on a crosscountry tour, \"to talk to anybody who wants to hear the<br />\ntruth.\"<br />\n\"I'll never know why the<br />\nGovernor would not come (to<br />\nAttica),\" the 38-year-old black<br />\nman from Buffalo said. He recalled enduring the attack lock -<br /><br />\ned in a room with ten other<br />\nmembers of the observers team<br />\ninside the prison walls. Eve related that as they watched the<br />\ndead being brought out, Tom<br />\nWicker broke down in tears,<br />\nsaying, \"I wish the governor<br />\nhad come.\"<br />\n\"All of us cried at one time<br />\nor another,\" Eve stated.<br />\nThe group, which varied in<br />\nsize from 10 to 20 members<br />\nhad spent the previous five<br />\ndays in frantic talks with the<br />\n1200 inmates in cell block D at<br />\nAttica. The inmates had their<br />\nown prisoners, 3<br />\n.7 guards and<br />\nprison employes, and were demanding a long list of reforms<br />\nas well as amnesty before the<br />\nmen would go free.<br />\nThe obervers had requested<br />\ntha Governor Rockefeller come<br />\nto Attica, not to meet with inmates, but to talk with their<br />\ncommittee on the seriousnesss<br />\nof the situation. If he didn't<br />\ncome, they predicted a slaughter.<br />\n\"A visit by the Governor<br />\nwas the key to the situation.<br />\nThe inmates cheered when we<br />\ntold them we were trying to<br />\nget him to come,\" Eve said, adding that he didn't believe a<br />\nlife would have been lost had<br />\nRockefeller come.<br />\nEve maintains that his committee was there only to observe and relay messages. \"We<br />\nwere never negotiators. We<br />\ncould not negotiate with their<br />\nlives.\"<br />\nThroughout the talks he had<br />\nwith the prisoners, Eve was impressed with the order he<br />\nfound in the<br />\nstockade. He reports that each<br />\ntime the committee went in,<br />\nit sat at a table<br />\nsurrounded by<br />\nthree lines of inmates. This<br />\ngroup protected<br />\nthe members of<br />\nthe committee<br />\nfrom harm. Eve<br />\nunderstands<br />\nthat the guards<br />\nwere Black Muslims.<br />\n\"The overall impression was<br />\none of solidarity and democracy,\" he says. \"They had re-<br /><br />\nspect for human life. The hos-.<br />\ntages slept on matresses while<br />\nthe prisoners had hard beds.<br />\nThe guards ate what the prisoners ate.\" Eve claims that during<br />\nthe attack, a prisoner fell on<br />\ntop of the hostage he was supposed to execute and was shot<br />\nand killed, saving the life of the<br />\nprison guard.<br />\nEve did not find the same respect for humanity outside of<br />\nthe prison walls. \"The Governor doesn't value human life<br />\nenough to take a 30 minute<br />\nplane ride.\"<br />\nEve claims that prison officials put the lives of the observers in danger by telling the inmates that the committee had<br />\nagreed that the hostages should<br />\nbe set free and negotiations<br />\nshould continue on neutral<br />\ngrounds, when actually the<br />\ngroup had made no such agreement. \"Some of them were<br />\nready to kill us when we went<br />\nback in there, but they could<br />\ntell that we were sincere.\"<br />\nThe state Assemblyman<br />\nclaims that the officials were<br />\nwilling to risk the lives of the<br />\nobservers to get an excuse for<br />\nstorming the prison.<br />\n\"They<br />\ndidn't<br />\neven care<br />\nabout their own guards,\" he<br />\nsays, adding that this did not<br />\nsurprise the prisoners because,<br />\n\"They understood the political<br />\nsystem better than I ever<br />\nhave.\"<br />\nAll of the guards at Attica<br />\nare white, while over 80 percent of the prisoners are black<br />\nor Puerto Rican. One of the demands of the rebels was a<br />\nSpanish interpreter in the prison medical center.<br />\n\"The guards<br />\nhad no training,<br />\ntraining that<br />\nthey had requested.

It's been available, of<br />\ncourse, for quite a while now;<br />\nbut that's alright. She gave us a<br />\nlong time to consider it.<br />\nIt seems that when somebody<br />\nwho makes fnusic dies abruptly,<br />\nhis music stops dead in time and<br />\nis no longer vulnerable to fads or<br />\nto the fickle preferences of<br />\nwhoever listens and supposedly<br />\nknows at at any given time.<br />\nAccordingly the music of<br />\nMorrison, of Hendrix, of<br />\nRedding (posthumous released<br />\nnotwithstanding) is frozen. It<br />\nwill not evolve or change or<br />\nshow the influence of anything<br />\nor anybody anymore, because he<br />\ncan no longer reveal to those of<br />\nus still here what is evolving,<br />\nchanging, or influencing him<br />\nnow. So it goes, of course, whth<br />\nJanis Joplin; and you will<br />\nunderstnad why this particular<br /><br />\nreview of Pearl comes later than<br />\nmost. Her next release can't<br />\nspoil anything I say about her.<br />\nSo it does go.<br />\nThere's a good chance you<br />\nalready have Pearl. If so, there's<br />\nan even greater chance that it's<br />\nworn nearly smooth by now.<br />\nBut if you're cheap like me and<br />\nyou haven't even gotten around<br />\nto getting a copy of Cheap<br />\nThrills yet, maybe you're a little<br />\ninterested in reading a- little<br />\nabout Pearl and a little about<br />\nJanis Joplin. Maybe you're not. I<br />\ndon't care. Neither would she,<br />\nI'll bet.<br />\nI saw her perform once before<br />\nshe died, which makes me a<br />\ncelebrity. It was at the Atlantic<br />\nCity Race Track three weeks<br />\nbefore Woodstock. If you can't<br />\nremember back that far,<br />\nimmediately, try to recall the<br />\ntime in your life when the<br />\nOfficial Decoder Hand Signal<br /><br />\nJanis Joplin<br /><br />\nwas index and middle fingers<br />\nextended. Well, I had shimmied<br />\nup a huge pipe that ran along the<br />\nunderside of the gradstand roof<br />\nSO I could see the show and<br />\neverybody else watching. A<br />\npretty good idea, I thought,<br />\nuntil I nearly fell from my lofty<br />\nperch trying mentally to TAKE<br />\nIT during \"Piece of my Heart.\"<br />\nA grisly death it would have<br />\nbeen, to have been impaled upon<br />\nthousands of punji-stick fingers,<br />\nraised frenziedly skyward.<br />\nA lot of the wailing on Pearl is<br />\nthe same Janis Joplin I saw then.<br />\nYou know. Driving, raw<br />\nscreaming, taste-of-blood-in-the-mouth sex. And, of course, it's<br />\ntremendous. There is a laugh<br />\nsomewhere on the album that<br />\nmay sound to you like a witch,<br />\nbut it sounds to me like a<br />\ntwenty-three year old white<br />\ntrash girl who got it when she<br />\nwas eleven for the first time<br /><br />\nfrom Uncle Harold and her life's<br />\nbeen downhill ever since. That<br />\nlaugh says a lot.<br />\nThere is one more thing on<br />\nthis particular album that says a<br />\nlot that I must mention. It is the<br />\nthing I have ever heard on a<br />\nrecording. It makes me sad<br />\nwhenever I hear it. It is when<br />\nJanis Joplin yells,\"Everybody!\"<br />\nduring \"Mercedes Benz\" and<br />\nthen when she sings the next<br />\nchorus it's still just her voice,<br />\ncompletely alone.<br />\nJanis Joplin sang the blues.<br />\nShe sang them loud and she sang<br />\nthem soft. She wasn't musically<br />\nperfect; she wasn't the Beatles.<br />\nThat is, she couldn't sound like<br />\nanything or anybody or any<br />\nfeeling imaginable. But she could<br />\nsing the blues, and she could sing<br />\nthem better than any bitch you<br />\never stepped out on.<br /><br />\nSept'. 17, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 8<br /><br />\nFlight Over Maryland's Cuckoo's Nest.<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\nresult of a legal mix-up.

In comparing<br />\nthe current squad to last year's<br />\n5-4 second place outfit, Cox<br />\nobserved that \"We've got a lot<br />\nmore cohesion this year and<br />\nseem to have more enthusiasm.<br />\nThere is a healthy competition;<br />\neach player must learn two<br />\npositions, so there's less<br />\nspecialization and more unity.\"<br />\nHopkins' new coach has<br />\ndeclined as yet to name a<br />\ntentative starting lineup and<br />\ninstead plans to wait until after<br />\ntomorrow's scrimmage at<br />\nLebanon Valley to do so. Cox,<br />\nhowever, did make note of<br />\nseveral \"interesting battles\" for<br />\nstarting assignments that will<br />\nhave to be resolved.<br />\nJunior Tim Weglicki, an<br />\noutstanding performer last year,<br />\nis in danger of losing his split<br />\n'end post to upstart Grant<br />\nShevchik. With Weglicki having<br />\nmissed three days of practice<br />\nfrom an injury, Shevchik,<br />\nappearing \"the best he's ever<br />\nlooked at Hopkins,\" seems to<br />\nhave the upper hand.<br />\nSophomores Mike Bogdan and<br />\nRick Kowalchuk are fighting for<br />\nthe tight end spot. A hurt<br />\nshoulder sidelined the latter for<br />\nthree days, but \"a very good<br /><br />\ngame in last Saturday's<br />\nscrimmage\" has put Kowalchuk<br />\nback in the thick of<br />\ncompetition. Keith Krantz and<br />\nMike O'Brien are locked in \"a<br />\nheated battle\" for the nod at<br />\ndefensive tackle.<br />\nThe quarterback situation is<br />\ntaking shape but as yet remains<br />\nunsettled. With junior John<br />\nShanahan having lost five days<br />\nwith a leg injury and freshman<br />\nRick Kramer only having<br />\npracticed with the team for a<br />\nweek, sophomore Jack Thomas<br />\nhas been getting most of the<br />\nwork at this key position.<br />\nSophomore Pat Cameron<br />\nsustained a knee injury and will<br />\nbe lost to the team indefinitely.<br />\nThe rest of the offensive<br />\n'backfield appears to feature<br />\nboth talent and depth. Captain<br />\nButch Robey, a defensive back<br />\nhalf of last season, and Jim<br />\nFerguson, a converted defensive<br />\nlineman, have been impressive<br />\ncarrying the ball. The pair is<br />\ncomplemented by last year's<br />\nsteady performer Pat Neary and<br />\nGarry Stringer.<br />\nCox concedes that the<br />\nquestion of the offensive line<br />\nholds the key to the success of<br />\nthe running game. Although he<br />\nlauded Sam Pahnisano for an<br />\n\"outstanding job\" at center, he<br />\npainfully pointed to tackle Jim<br />\nAdams' shoulder injury as \"a big<br />\nsetback.\" Adams will be<br />\nsidelined for three weeks, after<br /><br />\nwhich Cox hopes \"he will pick<br />\nup whe-re he left off:Meanwhile, the line \"needs an<br />\nawful lot of work at offensive<br />\ntackle; it's up for grabs.\"<br />\nThe twenty-one freshmen<br />\nwho have tried out for the team<br />\nhave been enthusiastically hailed<br />\nby Cox as \"doing an excellent<br />\njob.\" Inasmuch as none were<br />\nspecifically recruited, they<br />\nrepresent a real \"bumper crop\"<br />\nthat promises to add \"ability<br />\nand depth\" to the squad. Curtis<br />\nJohnson has shown a lot of<br />\npotential at offensive tackle and<br />\ndefensive end; both Jack Coulter<br />\nand Manuel Hernandez were<br />\npraised at defensive back as<br />\n\"very promising.\"<br />\nThe defense appears able to<br />\n\"contain the outside running<br />\ngame,\" but the secondary might<br />\nbe another story. \"The pass<br />\ndefense is difficult, but coming<br />\nalong,\" Cox remarked. \"It's not<br />\nup to what I'd like it to be, but<br />\nit will continue to develop.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays open the season<br />\nSeptember, 27 against a strong<br />\nteam from Muhlenberg. When<br />\nquestioned about his feelings<br />\ntoward the game and the MAC<br />\ntitle race, Cox replied,'\"My first<br />\nthought is that I want to be 1-0.<br />\nMy second thought is that I<br />\nwant to improve on last year's<br />\nrecord, and my third is that<br />\nwant to win the league<br />\nchampionship.\"<br /><br />\nSports Shorts Potpourri Frosh Recruits Aid<br />\n'By BRUCE BORTZ<br />\nHopkins' inter-collegiate fall<br />\nseason begins in earnest on<br />\nSeptember 25t1l, eight days from<br />\nnow and anywhere from one to<br />\ntwo weeks behind a great many<br />\ncolleges and universities across<br />\nthe country.<br />\nWhile these pages have<br />\nfocused until now on fall sports,<br />\nnamely football, soccer and<br />\ncross-country, a number of<br />\nsignificant things have already<br />\noccurred relative to winter and<br />\nspring sports at Hopkins that<br />\ndeserve note.<br />\nLoveland New Coach<br />\nFirst off, Joe Loveland, last<br />\nyear's star forward for Hopkins'<br />\nbasketball five, will replace Bill<br />\nGaertner as freshmen basketball<br />\ncoach. Gaertner left for a<br />\nposition at the University of<br />\nConnecticut. According to<br />\nLoveland, there remains some<br />\nconfusion as to whether this<br />\nteam will be a \"freshman\"team<br />\nor a \"junior varsity\" team.<br />\nLacrosse Interchange<br />\nFar more certain of its<br />\nprogram is this year's Blue Jay<br />\nLacrosse team. Its 1972 setup<br />\nwill definitely include a junior<br />\nvarsity team and a varsity team<br /><br />\nwith an interchange of personnel<br />\npermitted between the two<br />\nteams from one week to the<br />\nnext. Coach Robert Scott, of<br />\ncourse, would have been<br />\njumping with delight with such<br />\nan arrangement last year.<br />\nNew Plastic Sticks Introduced<br />\nOne other lacrosse<br />\ndevelopment promises to have<br />\nmore far reaching an effect on<br />\nHopkins' lacrosse and on the<br />\ngame in general. Plastic sticks<br />\n(plastic only inside of and<br />\naround the net) made their first<br />\nippearance on the lacrosse field<br />\nthis past spring. In fact, by<br />\nseason's end, a great many<br />\nplayers on the University of<br />\nVirginia's team were using these<br />\nnew, somewhat lighter, sticks.<br />\nAttackmen, middies, and even<br />\ngoalies playing in leagues in the<br />\nBaltimore area began to use<br />\nthem en masse this summer.<br />\nJunior Eddie Levin, a member<br />\nof last Year's lacrosse team at<br />\nHopkins, offered several reasons<br />\nfor the sudden proliferation of<br />\nthe new-fangled sticks. \"The old<br />\nwooden stick often took days,<br />\neven weeks to break in.

As co-captain Ed<br />\nCummings stated, \"Sometimes<br />\nwe have very little reason to<br />\nkeep on running, except maybe<br />\nto increase our own satisfaction<br />\nand pride.\"<br />\nFor the last three seasons, this<br />\nfeeling of ; self-satisfaction has<br />\nsometimes been the only thing<br />\nto be gained from running<br />\ncross-country. Occasionally,<br />\nlosing became such a depressing<br />\nexperience for the runners that<br />\nthey showed up for practice<br />\nonly to keep the cross-country<br />\nteam in existence for another<br />\nyear.<br />\nYet, the three top runners on<br />\nthe team this year, namely,<br /><br />\ndummings, Galagher and Dubiel,<br />\nfeel that this season will be<br />\ndifferent. According to these<br />\nrunners, there is an entirely<br />\ndifferent feeling on the team this<br />\nyear - one of eagerness,<br />\ncompetitive desire and spirit.<br />\nAll three men attribute this<br />\nnew attitude to the presence of<br />\nfreshmen recruits on the varsity<br />\nteam this year. As Cummings<br />\nsummarized it, \"Their presence<br />\nadds a lot to the team; now we<br />\nalways have to do our best, to<br />\nkeep someone else from taking<br />\nour job away.\"<br />\nRuss Dubiel, a top sophomore<br />\nrunner who suffered through a<br />\nwinless season last year, also<br />\nnotices a change on the team.<br />\nRuss feels that there is definitely<br />\nmore talent available, due to the<br />\nexcellent.off-season recruiting of<br />\ncoach Don Masken.<br />\nAs Coach Masken put it,<br />\n\"This year, for once, I have<br />\nseven or eight boys who I know<br />\ncan do the job right from the<br />\nstart.\" As of this moment, the<br />\nteam is running an average of<br />\n8-10 miles a day, and is in good<br />\nshape, with no serious injuries:<br /><br />\nWELCOME ABOARD!<br />\nSCHOOL OPENING SPECIALS:<br />\n** CA NNON-TL-QL 450 innt 1.8 lens<br />\nCase and 135 mm<br />\n2.8 Auto Lens<br /><br />\n!S199.50<br /><br />\n\"NIKKORMAT-w/ 50mm 2.0 Auto Lens Case and 135mm<br />\n2.8 Auto Lens<br /><br />\nS289.50<br /><br />\nC<br /><br />\nPfioto<br /><br />\n3011 GREEN MOUNT AVENUE<br /><br />\nSept. 17, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 11<br /><br />\nTransfer Enrollment Falls<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital<br /><br />\nby daniel epstein<br /><br />\nAllied Health School<br />\n(continued from page 1)<br />\nradiology facilities with twice<br />\nthe present capacity be set up,<br />\nthat new private patient beds be<br />\nobtained, that a new obstetrical<br />\narea be established, and that the<br />\nPhipps psychiatric clinic be<br />\nrenovated.
