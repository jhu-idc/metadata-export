Benton will replace Allyn W. Kimball as Dean of<br />\nthe Faculty of Arts and Sciences<br />\nat the end of this academic year.<br />\nThe appointment, effective July<br />\n1, was announced Tuesday by<br />\nLincoln Gordon. Dean Kimball<br />\nasked to be relieved of the deanship approximately one month<br />\nago. He says that he wants to<br />\nreturn to teaching and research in<br />\nthe university's Department of Biostatistics, where he formerly served<br />\nas chairman.<br />\nDr. Benton is currently a Professor of Meteorology and Chairman<br />\nof the Department of Earth and<br />\nPlanetary Sciences. He has been .a<br />\nmember of the Hopkins faculty<br />\nsince 1948.<br />\nGordon called Benton \"a scholar<br />\nand administrator of well-deserved<br />\ninternational reputation, who has<br />\n<br />\nmade important contributions to<br />\nscientific knowledge.\" Gordon<br />\nadded that Hopkins was \"indeed<br />\nfortunate to have found within its<br />\nranks a man so eminently qualified<br />\nto assume the deanship.\"<br />\nDifficult Decision<br />\nBenton was approached with the<br />\noffer three weeks ago,and decided<br />\nto accept the appointment last<br />\nweek. He states that the decision<br />\nto accept the post was 'a difficult<br />\none for him to make. \"Someone in<br />\nmy position gives up an awful lot,\"<br />\nwhen taking an administrative<br />\npost, he said. Benton believes he<br />\nwill be able to devote very little<br />\ntime to his academic specialty<br />\nwhile he serves as Dean.<br />\nKimball said that when he accepted the post of Dean, he<br />\nthought that he would be able to<br />\nmaintain some activity in his role<br />\n<br />\nas professor. He found, however,<br />\nthat this was impossible during<br />\nhis four years in Gilman Hall.<br />\nKimball estimates that he put in<br />\nseventy to eighty hours per week<br />\nin his job. Gordon referred to the<br />\ndeanship as \"a man-killing job.\"<br />\nBenton is familiar with the duties of a top-level administrator, if<br />\nnot with those of the Homewood<br />\ndeanship. For three years, until<br />\nlast September, he was director of<br />\nResearch Laboratories of the<br />\nEnvironmental Science Services<br />\nAdministration of the Department<br />\nof Commerce while on leave from<br />\nHopkins. From the ESSA research<br />\nlaboratories in Boulder, Colorado,<br />\nhe directed research efforts in the<br />\nenvironmental sciences at fifteen<br />\nlaboratories throughout the country.<br />\n<br />\nLanguage Requirements Removed<br />\nBy A. MICHAEL HILL<br />\nThe Academic Council last week<br />\nabolished the University-wide foreign language requirement, effective as of July 1, 1970.<br />\nThe council acted on a recommendation from the Committee<br />\non Undergraduate Studies. The<br />\naction removes the previous requirement of one year beyond the<br />\nelements of a foreign language<br />\nwhich was necessary for the B.A.<br />\ndegree.<br />\nThis move does not prevent the<br />\nvarious departments from requiring a foreign language in order to<br />\nget a degree majoring in that department. The Committee on Undergraduate Studies will decide<br />\nwhat language requirements are<br />\nnecessary for the area majors.<br />\nNo Deadline<br />\nAlthough no deadline has been<br />\nset for the decisions, Dean Kimball<br />\nstated that he hoped that they<br />\nwould be made quickly. Dean<br />\nSwanson, chairman of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,<br />\nsaid that a preliminary sounding<br />\nout of the faculty indicated that<br />\nthe Humanities area major would<br />\nkeep some foreign language requirement. He stressed that any<br />\ndecisions that his committee<br />\nmakes will be in consultation with<br />\n<br />\nDr. William McClain: \"There is no<br />\nreason\" for retaining the language<br />\nrequirement.<br />\nphoto by Lernm<br />\n<br />\nthe faculties of the various areas,<br />\nand that, in essence, the decision<br />\nis up to the faculty.<br />\nImprove Morale<br />\nDr. Elias L. Rivers, chairman of<br />\nthe Department of Romance Languages, stated that \"A majority of<br />\nmy department was in favor of the<br />\nmove.\" He felt that it would \"improve morale, both among graduates and undergraduates.\"<br />\n<br />\nDr. William McClain, chairman<br />\nof the German Department said<br />\n\"We were not in favor of retaining<br />\nit as there is no reason for it.\" He<br />\ndid feel that this change would<br />\n\"put special responsibilities on advisers as it is possible that-a student might not get the language<br />\n\"needed for graduate study.\" Dr.<br />\nMcClain also pointed out that the<br />\nAcademic Council's action was<br />\ngoing to allow the German department to make several curriculumchanges. Next year there will be<br />\nfour intermediate level courses,<br />\none emphasizing contemporary fiction, one in conversation, one in<br />\nscientific German, and another<br />\ndesigned for people going to the<br />\nintermediate level directly from<br />\nhigh school. Dr. McClain stated<br />\nthat \"We welcome the oppOrtunity to teach new things.\"<br />\nFree Time for Grads<br />\nDr. Rivers also indicated the<br />\npossibility of curriculum changes<br />\nin the Romance Languages, perhaps including the institution of an<br />\nintensive first-year course. But, he<br />\nfelt that the action would mainly<br />\n\"mean more free time for graduate<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nThe phrasing of the resolution<br />\npassed by the Academic council<br />\nmeans_ that everyone who grad,(Continued on page 5)<br />\n<br />\nNewly-appointed Dean George Benton will \"see that enough time and effort are spent in determining a direction.\"<br />\n<br />\nBenton noted two major questions which must be answered in<br />\nthe coming years. First, the role of<br />\nthe university in the changing<br />\nsociety must be determined; and<br />\nsecond, the role which Hopkins<br />\nitself must play has also to be<br />\ndecided. He sees his role as Dean<br />\nrevolving around an effort to \"see<br />\nthat enough time and effort is<br />\nspent in determining a direction.\"<br />\nHe says that Hopkins provides<br />\nopportunities unique among American universities. He cited Hopkins'<br />\nsize, labelling it the \"smallest of<br />\nthe true universities.\" This small<br />\nsize, he says, gives this university a<br />\ngreater flexibility than is commonly found. Hopkins is \"still malleable,\" he said.<br />\n\"Life's Too Short\"<br />\nBenton declined to specify what<br />\nchanges might occur when he assumes the deanship. He said that<br />\nhe did not want to enter his job<br />\nwith fixed conceptions. In many,<br />\nmatters, he said, he would be<br />\nswayed by those who advised him<br />\nand by the opinion of the majority of those concerned in decisions. \"If you can't (defer to the<br />\nmajority) you get the hell out,<br />\nright?\" He continued. \"It's no fun<br />\nworking for something you don't<br />\nbelieve in, and life's too short not<br />\nto have fun.\"<br />\nThe new Dean may face a<br />\ndifficult situation, his background<br />\nnot including the humanities and<br />\nsocial sciences; coeducation could<br />\nmean a shift in the emphasis of<br />\nHopkins' program toward ,the<br />\nhumanities and social sciences.<br />\nBenton acknowledges that this<br />\nmay cause problems. \"I think that<br />\nI would naturally have problems,\"<br />\n(Continued on page 4)<br />\n<br />\n\fDec. 12, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 2<br />\n<br />\nMcGovern: 'Silent Majority' Unpatriotic<br />\nIn an interchange laced with liberal<br />\nrhetoric and humor, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota last Sunday night<br />\ncalled the younger generation \"perhaps<br />\nthe most sensitive and intelligent and<br />\nalert group this country has ever produced.\"<br />\nSenator McGovern spoke in Baltimore<br />\nSunday at the Forum Series of the Temple<br />\nOheb Shalom.

Last<br />\nDecember, Zeke Boyd, formerly a major<br />\nin the Panthers, was circulating Black<br />\nPanther literature at the Trailways Bus<br />\nStation. Two terminal policemen asked<br />\nhim to stop circulating the pamphlets, he<br />\nrefused, walked away and was maced.<br />\nZeke was later charged with resisting<br />\narrest and disorderly conduct. In both<br />\ncharges he was found not guilty.<br />\nIn early March, five Panthers were<br />\nstopped and searched by approximately<br />\ntwenty policemen as they were walking<br />\npast a school one block from their headquarters. The police charged them with<br />\nconduct, trespassing on<br />\ndisorderly<br />\nschool property, and interfering with the<br />\nduties of a police officer. Bail money<br />\nwas paid, but the charges were dropped<br />\nbefore the case went to court.<br />\nThese two incidents, according to their<br />\nlawyer, William Zinman, were cases of<br />\n\"pure harassment.\" He stated that it is<br />\nthese incidents that the Wickwire committee will try to prevent in the future,<br />\n\"We're going to try to stop the police<br />\nGestapo methods now being used,\" Zinman remarked, \"and demonstrate that<br />\noverkill by police authorities will only<br />\n(Continued on page 5)<br />\n<br />\n\fPIAGE 4<br />\n<br />\n\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nDec. 12, 1969<br />\n<br />\n*******************;<br />\nN ;(*****-***<br />\n<br />\n*Benton Gets Deanship;<br />\n*************************<br />\n* Faces Financial Bind<br />\nSteer<br />\n<br />\nGodfrey's<br />\n<br />\nand<br />\nBeer<br />\n**************************<br />\nGRAND OPENING TOMORROW!<br />\nFamous For...<br />\nPizza<br />\nBeef Sandwiches<br />\nDraft Beer in Frosted Mugs<br />\nCarry-Out, too!<br />\n<br />\nKA'MAT<br />\nDID VIM<br />\nAVNO6PAVA<br />\nmeet all the gang at... *<br />\n<br />\nGodfrey's Steer & Beer ))<br />\n3226 Greenmount Ave.<br />\n(near 33rd st.)<br />\n*********************<br />\n<br />\n(From page 1)<br />\nhe<br />\nsaid, \"in<br />\ntrying<br />\nto<br />\nunderstand the<br />\nfields<br />\nwhich<br />\nare not within<br />\nmy own disciplines<br />\nHowever,<br />\nhe<br />\nnoted that no<br />\nman<br />\ncould<br />\nhave<br />\nknowledge of<br />\nall<br />\ndisciplines and<br />\nthat any incoming<br />\nDean<br />\nwould experience the same<br />\ndifficulties.<br />\nDean Kimball<br />\nlabelled<br />\nthe<br />\nsupposed<br />\nshift in empDEAN ALLYN W.

The revisions include the reorganization of several of the old courses, as well as the<br />\ninstitution of several new ones.<br />\nTo replace the old Chemistry 1-2<br />\nand Physics 1-2 introductory sequence,<br />\nand the present Modern Physics course,<br />\na two-year General Physics course<br />\nhas been designed, encompassing most<br />\nof the material included in the scrapped<br />\ncourses. It includes a one -semester<br />\nChemistry lab.<br />\n<br />\nNew Courses<br />\nThe Physics Department's intermediate courses have been made into onesemester courses. This includes Optics and Thermodynamics, which were<br />\nboth formerly full-year courses. The<br />\nsole exception to this rule in Electromagnetic Theory, which is still a fullyear course.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to these revamped old courses, a number of new courses are being<br />\noffered. Three courses intended primarily for Physics majors are new; these<br />\nare: Atomic and Molecular Structure,<br />\nNuclear and Particle Physics, and Topics<br />\nin Astrophysic. Also, all the old lab<br />\ncourses have been consolidated into one<br />\nfull-year course to be taken by Juniors.<br />\nFor the first time, courses are also<br />\nbeing offered for non-Physical science<br />\nmajors. A General Physics for Biology majors is planned. Also new are<br />\na course in Astronomy and a course in<br />\nConcepts In Physics and Mathematics,<br />\nboth of which are intended for nonscience majors. Neither course has any<br />\nprerequisites.<br />\nConcepts in Physics and Mathematics<br />\nwill use an historical approach to introduce its ideas. Accordingto the course's<br />\narchitect, Dr. George Owen, the specific<br />\nsubject matter taught will depend in large<br />\npart on the interests of the class. Routine<br />\n\"mathematical drudgery\" will not enter<br />\nthe picture.<br />\nThe most interesting new addition to<br />\nthe Physics curriculum, however, is a<br />\ntwo semester course in Mathematical<br />\n<br />\nMethods in Physics.<br />\nThis course may, at the option of the<br />\nstudent, replace two of the four Math<br />\ncourses required of Physics majors.<br />\nThe course is the result of a longstanding dissatisfaction with the job the<br />\nMath Department has been doing of providing Physics students with the mathematical tools they used.<br />\nDr. Owen emphasized that he did not<br />\nintend to imply the Math Department<br />\nis either lazy or incompetent. Rather,<br />\ntheir orientation is towards the theoretical, or \"philosophical\" aspects of<br />\nmathematics, and not towards applied<br />\nmathematics. This move by the Physics Department may set a precedent<br />\nfor similar changes in other Departments, although the acquisition of any<br />\nsignificant numbers of faculty in Applied Mati-ematics would of course have<br />\nto be with the consent and cooperation<br />\nof the Math Department.<br />\nThis new program is designed to give<br />\nthe Physics student a wider choice in<br />\nthe courses available to him in his last<br />\ntwo years, and to render less painful<br />\nand more to-the-point, his studies in<br />\nfields allied to Physics.<br />\n<br />\nJHU Language<br />\nRequirement<br />\nEnds in July<br />\n(Continued from page 1)<br />\nuates after June, 1970 will not have to<br />\nfulfill the requirement. This year's<br />\nSeniors still come under the old rule.<br />\n<br />\n\"Anomalous\"<br />\nDean Kimball stated that, as were the<br />\nUniversity's last requirements, he felt<br />\nthat it was somewhat \"anomalous,\" but<br />\nthat foreign languages were necessary<br />\nfor some fields and he hoped in these<br />\nareas requirements would be strengthened.<br />\nThe dropping of this requirement<br />\nleaves only the physical education requirement as a University pre-requisite<br />\nfor graduation. Otherwise everything is<br />\nleft up to the departments in deciding<br />\nthe requirements for their majors, or,<br />\nin the case of area majors, it is left up<br />\nto the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies. This is now the case in the<br />\nlanguage area.<br />\n<br />\nArea Panthers<br />\nFace Arrests,<br />\nHarassment<br />\n(('ontinued from page 3)<br />\nbe met by stronger support for<br />\nthat organization.\"<br />\nThere are three Baltimore<br />\nPanthers presently in jail for a<br />\nvariety of charges. Defense Captain John Clark was arrested for<br />\ndriving without a license, Arlo<br />\nChanley was convicted on a burglery rap and sentenced to 5<br />\nyears in prison and a Panther<br />\ncalled Katara was charged by the<br />\nArmy with being absent with<br />\nofficial leave (AWOL). Last week<br />\nthe Panther Minister of Education, Tchak Zulu,was arrested as<br />\na convicted felon for carrying a<br />\nweapon. He is now out on bail<br />\nawaiting a grand jury trial.<br />\nAccording to the Panthers, all<br />\nthe charges except the one against<br />\nKatara have been trumped up by<br />\nthe police.<br />\n<br />\nFAILURE<br />\nfr\"nik<br />\n<br />\n\"We Will Fight\"<br />\nThe local members of the militant black organization are expecting a police raid soon on their<br />\nGay Street headquarters. \"warrant or no warrant, we will fight<br />\na police raid,\" stated a Panther<br />\nspokesman,<br />\nThe activities of this group, as<br />\nwell as all extreme left and rightWing groups, have been under the<br />\nsurveillance of a special squad of<br />\nthe Baltimore police.

Zinman<br />\nclaimed that DuBois' squad has<br />\nbeen empowered to tap the phones<br />\nof any questionable person.<br />\nZinman said that the Committee for Political Freedom will<br />\nattempt to counteract \"the attitude of repression\" now prevalen among many government and<br />\npolice officials. \"We don't want<br />\nthe police, under the guise of<br />\npublic protection, to stop any<br />\ngroup.fro nr orgarrizing;\" 'Con'eluded.<br />\n<br />\nYou'll never get anywhere without it.<br />\nNothing helps a young engineer's<br />\ncareer like being given a challenge.<br />\nWhich is another way of saying a chance<br />\nto fail now and then.

The traditional concept of the<br />\nseason is one of conviviality, reflection, joy and hopes of a better time to<br />\ncome.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Christian tendencies of this nation are rapidly falling<br />\nbefore the onslaught of a vast politicization of its minority groups and the<br />\nequally great shift of the government's emphasis from control to repression<br />\nand from action to reaction. Instead of providing the leadership of this<br />\nnation that its citizens expect, the Federal government is becoming more<br />\nand more entwined in 'extra-curricular' activities--such as counting and<br />\ncomparing the number of pro-war and anti-war letters it receives\u2014which<br />\nserve only to divide the nation further and not reach any conclusive<br />\nanswers.<br />\nVice President Agnew's remarks here in Baltimore are, as usual, relevant<br />\nto this point. After discarding his prepared speech, in which he took a long<br />\nlook at American education, he delivered ten minutes of off-the-cuff<br />\nremarks aimed, once again, at demonstrators. \"Where a majority of<br />\npeople,\" he said, \"has spoken in a free election, it is not salutary...to<br />\nresort to this constant harangue on the campus and streets.\" Nixon's 1968<br />\nplurality has now become a majority.<br />\nWhat the Vice President continually fails to ask himself is why minorities<br />\nare taking to the streets and to the campuses. This country, more than any<br />\nother, has traditionally been made up of minorities, and these minority<br />\ninterests have traditionally been forced to take account of each other.<br />\nThe difference now is that, unlike the Italians and the Poles and the Irish,<br />\nneither the young nor the Negroes are considered legitimate minority<br />\ngroups. They are thought of as dissidents, and whereas a minority interest<br />\nis something to be dealt with, dissidence is equated with anarchy and<br />\nsubversion.<br />\nThe ironic aspect of Mr. Agnew's remarks is that the prepared speech<br />\nwhich he released to the press had a.completely different ring to it, and,<br />\nhad it been used, might have gone a long way toward showing some groups<br />\nthat the administration really is interested in tackling some of its major<br />\nproblems in a positive manner. In that speech he said, \"If we are not going<br />\nto have revolutionary look at our institutions of education.\" He also noted<br />\nthat the government should consider changing the institutions to make<br />\nthem \"Fit the public rather than make the public fit the institutions.\"<br />\nOf course, it must be remembered that the speech was not delivered.<br />\nIn other areas, too, Christmas tidings are equally bleak. It is becoming<br />\nevident that the running battle between the Black Panthers and the<br />\nnation's police departments has a very interested onlooker in the person of<br />\nAttorney General- Mitchell, and that harassment of the Panthers is rapidly<br />\nchanging into a sophisticated attempt to eradicate the party through<br />\nviolent means.<br />\nThe. tax bill issue which is presently being fought out in Congress is<br />\ndegenerating into a sharp political battle, the results of which are likely to<br />\ncut Federal spending in the domestic sector even more, and drive the<br />\ninflation even higher.<br />\nAnd, on the war front, indications are that the President's next withdrawal will again only involve 35,000 troops and that the level of the<br />\nfighting will not lessen appreciably. By all admissions, the Paris peace talks<br />\nare deadlocked and not reaching any solutions.<br />\nMerry Christmas\u2014and a happy new decade.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER WILL BE PUBLISHING A<br />\nSPECIAL \"END OF THE DECADE\" ISSUE<br />\nEARLY NEXT WEEK IN TRIBUTE TO THE '60'S.<br />\nBE PREPARED.<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br />\n<br />\nRichard B.

And yet,<br />\nthe presence of ROTC on our campus<br />\nis the University's stamp of approval<br />\non military solutions to social problems.<br />\nROTC has no place on our campus, and<br />\nwe, the students, faculty and administrators who make up this community<br />\nshould immediately withdraw our support for antiquated military solutions.<br />\nLet us concentrate on the process of<br />\nfinding Human solutions to 20th century<br />\nproblems of population ctronl, environmental pollution, and improvement of<br />\nthe life conditions for all inhabitants of<br />\nthis, our Earth. NOW is the time,<br />\nthe time is NOW!<br />\nPeace,<br />\n<br />\nDavid H. Fankhauser, Biology<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn the responses to my factual letters<br />\n(News - Letter, Nov. '7 & 14), no one<br />\n<br />\nhas disputed that ROTC at Hopkins is a<br />\nnon-academic, extracurricular activity<br />\n\"serving\" a dwindling minority of Hopkins students. The inordinate amount of<br />\nspace such an activity occupies at a<br />\ncmpus where space is at a premium,<br />\nthe University contribution to an effort<br />\nof dubious value in times of financial<br />\nstress, and the contractural obligations<br />\nto the program need straightforward<br />\nand total reconsideration.<br />\n(1) ROTC is none of our business.<br />\nThis is a typical Army attitude expressed by Colonel Parmly, and is one reason ROTC does not belong on this campus. Yes, my correspondents, I agree<br />\nthat ROTC should not be a business of<br />\nthis university. This leads me to point<br />\n#2.<br />\n(2) The ROTC contract. This is a<br />\ncontract between the Army and the<br />\nUniversity; it is certainly not a contract<br />\nbetween the Army and the Army! Anyone<br />\ndesiring a copy of the contract can<br />\nreceive one from me for 10 zeroxing<br />\ncosts; see for yourself that this contract violates numerous Hopkins procedures and principles. the Academic<br />\nCouncil should forthwith recommend termination of this contract; one academic<br />\nyear's notice of such intent is required<br />\nin the contract.<br />\n(3) Faculty and Administration are unknowledgeable. Many of use have taken<br />\nROTC, served in the Armed Forces,<br />\nperused the Army-dictated ROTC course<br />\noutlines, and observed ROTC on this<br />\ncampus for a number of years. We<br />\ndidn't arrive last September fresh out<br />\nof high school!<br />\n(4) ROTC \"serves\" a waning minority.<br />\nMy letters pointed out, and Colonel<br />\nParmly agrees, that there has been a<br />\ndrastic reduction in ROTC participation by Hopkins students. I pointed out<br />\nthat this was a long-term trend and<br />\naccurately presented data compiled from<br />\nthe \"Report of the Professor of Military Science\" that appears annually as<br />\npart of the \"Report of the Faculties<br />\n(Continued on page 9)<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 9<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nDec. 12, 1969<br />\n<br />\nOn the Honor Commission<br />\n\"An article on the effects of the honor<br />\ncommission at Hopkins? Sorry,we can't<br />\nrun any completely blank spaces in the<br />\npaper.\"<br />\nEveryone here at Hopkins lives under<br />\nthe Honor Code; all of us have signed that<br />\nPledge on the application form to abide<br />\nby the code. Most of us have taken that<br />\ntest in Freshman year, heard those<br />\nfreshman<br />\norientation lectures, and<br />\nCheated, or attempted to, on exams.<br />\nSome people do, however, come before<br />\nthe Honor Commission on charges of<br />\ncheating.<br />\nJohn R.: 'Hello, this is Pete McGinn<br />\nand I've been told that you selected me<br />\nas your defense counsel for the honor<br />\ncommission trial.' Honor Commission?<br />\n<br />\nJesus. Faint memories of an ominous<br />\nletter received midway in the summer.<br />\nLess faint memories of accusations of<br />\ncheating. Confirmation. Slight dread.<br />\nWell, say something.<br />\n\"Oh, er....Hi\"<br />\n\"Hi\"<br />\n\"Well, what's going to happen?\"(Hung<br />\nby the neck until dead)<br />\n\"I can't really say. I thought we could<br />\nget together some time and discuss it.\"<br />\nSeems Reasonable. \"Lets do it.\"<br />\nArrangements are made. I learn of<br />\nthe situation and he learns my side of<br />\nthe story. Very reasonable.<br />\n<br />\nThe Commission<br />\nThe Honor Commission is made up<br />\n<br />\nthe Honor Commission members, who<br />\nare aware of the problem, at the Hopkins community.<br />\nSitting on the trial panel is supposed to be easy if the student pleads<br />\nguilty; he admits in that case the righteousness of the system, or at least there<br />\nis the implication in his actions that the<br />\nHonor Commission has the right to have<br />\npower over him. The panel merely has<br />\nto find the accused guilty and decide what<br />\npenalty would best serve both the individual and the community as a whole.<br />\nThe qualms come when it is realized<br />\nthat the Commission member who voted<br />\nfor guilt in the afternoon, could quite<br />\npossibly go home that night and watch<br />\nhis roommate cheat on a physics lab.<br />\nNo member of the community is required by the Honor Code to turn in violators of the Honor Code. As one student,<br />\nbefore<br />\nthe<br />\nHonor Commission on<br />\ncharges, put it:<br />\n<br />\nof 22 members; 7 of the members sit<br />\non any trial board. Seven fellows, not<br />\nunlike you or I, sit and judge their fellow students, having literally, at this<br />\nuniversity, the power of life and death.<br />\nFor the Honor Commission, if it finds<br />\na student guilty, can give a penalty ranging from blacklisting (which means that<br />\nif they catch you again you're in trouble), to mandatory withdrawal from the<br />\ncourse, to failure in the course, to expulsion from the University (for a second offense).<br />\nLet he who is blameless cast the first<br />\nstone. I am unaware if anyone brought<br />\nthe commission on charges of \"unfair<br />\nadvantage\" has ever hurled that epithet<br />\nat the trial board. Or, rather than at<br />\n<br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\n(Continued from page 8)<br />\nAdministration\". The University<br />\nCirculars are in the library, and anyone may check my figures which are<br />\nfor \"final enrollments\" in ROTC. I<br />\ngave ROTC<br />\nthe benefit of the doubt.<br />\nFor example, in 1968's report there<br />\nIs the statement: \"Retention of freshmen to completion of MS I showed<br />\ncontinued improvement (70 of 89).\" On<br />\nthe next page the same report states<br />\nthat 26 freshmen withdrew from the<br />\nprogram and that the final enrollment<br />\nwas 79. I kindly used the figure of 79.<br />\nAt least the final total<br />\nenrollment<br />\nfor 1968 (206) is close to Colonel Farm1's \"Corrected\" figure (205). how'<br />\never, Colonel Parmly's \"corrected,<br />\nfigures for other recent years run over<br />\nthose published in the annual reports<br />\nby 29% for 1967 (35% padding if nonHopkins students are excluded), 61% for<br />\n1966, 43% for 1965, 11% for 1964, and<br />\n36% for 1963. In any event, either set<br />\nof figures substantiates one main point<br />\nof my letters, namely that interest in<br />\nROTC has dropped substantially in the<br />\n1960's, beginning before the pressures<br />\nof Vietnam and continuing since.<br />\n<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\n(5) ROTC is becoming \"efficient\". In<br />\nresponse to may data relating to extremely low ROTC retention rates (e.g. 14%<br />\nfor 1967 graduates) and attendant waste<br />\nof effort, Colonel Parmly points out<br />\nROTC's increasing efficienty. He speaks<br />\nof detention rates, not retention rates.<br />\nIf efficienty is an $80 billion military<br />\nbudget that pumps scholarship money<br />\ninto pockets of those willing to sign<br />\nArmy contracts rather than to support<br />\n<br />\n\"MC P6F6NPAOT A1-1.e6E5<br />\nThis COURT HAS DEPeIvED<br />\nI-11M OF H15<br />\nCoNSTrrU-<br />\n<br />\nthose most in need....then ROTC is becoming more efficient. If efficiency is<br />\na terrible war with the threat of Army<br />\ninduction....then ROTC is becoming more<br />\nefficient. The Army purports that select deferments allow additional training<br />\nwhich benefits the Armed Services by<br />\nproviding experienced manpower. And<br />\nwhat, may I ask, about the rest of the<br />\nNation's endeavors that are as critical<br />\nand often more important for a strong<br />\nAmerica: It at first seems enigmatic<br />\nto hear ene actually brag about ROTC's<br />\npower to protect a select group anxious<br />\nto post-pone military service, but might<br />\none expect this of an individualncommitted to the Army rather than to the University?<br />\n(6) ROTC is extracurricular. For 2<br />\nyears ROTC has been a non-academic<br />\nactivity at Hopkins, but little has been<br />\ndone to place it in this perspective.<br />\nThe Undergraduate Studies Committee<br />\nshould see that Military Science courses<br />\nare eliminated totally from all academic<br />\nrecords of students entering hereafter.<br />\nFurthermore, this same rule should<br />\napply to any currently enrolled student<br />\nwho requests that Military Science not<br />\nbe recorded on his transcript. Such a<br />\nmove would allow withdrawal from ROTC<br />\nwithout an F on the academic record for<br />\na non-academic activity in the case of<br />\nFor example,<br />\nJuniors and Seniors.<br />\nstudents with favorable draft numbers or<br />\nwho for other reasons change their minds<br />\nduring their Hopkins tenure would feel<br />\nmore free to pursue individual interests.<br />\nFurthermore, all descriptions of military Science should be removed from<br />\n<br />\n0A0<br />\n<br />\nVEFEK)12AMIT<br />\n<br />\n\"Personal Needs\"?<br />\n<br />\nthe academic portion of the University<br />\nCircular of Undergraduate Programs,<br />\nand it should be made clear to prospective students that academic credit is<br />\nnot given. A short entry on ROTC, in<br />\nkeeping with those for other student<br />\nactivities, can be placed in \"The Hopkins Campus and Student Life\" section.<br />\nCertain portions of the current ROTC<br />\nwrite-up are in definite conflict with<br />\nuniversity policy and require outright<br />\nelimination, for example: \"Students enrolling in the ROTC program agree to<br />\ncomplete the Basic Course (freshman<br />\nand sophomore years) as a prerequisite<br />\nto graduation, unless relieved of the<br />\nobligation by competent authority.\" Finally, military personnel assigned to<br />\nHopktns should be stricken from the list<br />\nof Faculty at the end of the Circular<br />\nsince this is essentially a list of the<br />\nteaching staff in the Faculty of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br />\n<br />\n\"The point that never seems to get<br />\nacross in the psuedo-intellectual orientation talks about the Honor Code is<br />\nthat an individual has as a responsibility to not only himself, but also to<br />\nhis fellow students. It is often understood as a decision reflecting only on<br />\nthe personal needs and wants of the individual. It ignores the responsibility<br />\nthat the individual owes to others. An<br />\nindividual has to realize that his actions<br />\nare not independent of the society around him. A personal moral code is<br />\nfine, but it must take into consideration<br />\nthat it functions in a world of moral<br />\ncodes.\"<br />\nOkay, fine. But the fact remains that<br />\npeople do not turn in their friends to<br />\nthe Honor Commission. People who<br />\nget caught are those with few friends,<br />\nmany enemies, or a suspicious teacher. All too often, the man who pleads<br />\nguilty is not saying that he lives under<br />\nHonor and slipped from the rosy path<br />\ninto the thorns just this once. He lives<br />\nin the briar patch, and this time he was<br />\ncaught in it. As soon as you turn him<br />\nloose, that's where he's headed, only he<br />\nis going to be a hell of a lot more careful this time.<br />\n<br />\n(7) ROTC space can be utilized to<br />\ngreater advantage. In suggesting this,<br />\nI did not have in mind revival of defunct organizations such as the radio<br />\nclub to fill up wasted space at ROTC<br />\ninvitation. Rather, I intended to suggest that space in a university-owned<br />\nbuilding now be reallocated by the Administration for use by on-going student organizations such as SC, BSU,<br />\nGrad. Student Assoc., etc., and that<br />\nother space be remodeled into classrooms for assignment by the Registrar, not by ROTC. The \"Classroom<br />\nSpace Committee\" and the \"Committee on Student Affairs\" should enquire<br />\n<br />\nThis University doesn't live under the<br />\nHonor Code. Its students submit to the<br />\npower vested in the Commission, in<br />\ntacit acquiescence that the Commission<br />\nis bigger than they are. But living under<br />\nthe Honor Code has something to do<br />\nwith taking it into account the next time<br />\na tough exam comes up.<br />\n(Continued on page 11)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 12)<br />\n<br />\nTHE CO-OEFEIJPAUTS SPE<br />\n17EnDAN1.<br />\nttnT1-1<br />\n<br />\nPavlovics<br />\n<br />\nSHACKW TH6 CO-PEFEMONOTS,<br />\n<br />\nRIGHTS.<br />\n<br />\nPublishers-Hall<br />\nSyndicate<br />\n<br />\n-rtfb PRESS IS COT-CAI-<br />\n<br />\nIMFOUMP -the PESS.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nenegigWe_.<br />\n<br />\nCOUIQTRY (5<br />\nSI-OCKEV.<br />\n<br />\n5EQUEST6R<br />\n<br />\ncow-FRY.<br />\n<br />\nflk MEASURES TAKEN)<br />\nHERE TODAY ARE ONLY<br />\nTO WSW& A FAR<br />\nTRIA<br />\n<br />\n\fDec. 1 1, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 10<br />\n<br />\nfeatures<br />\nAntonio Sano: Another Pachueo<br />\nIn my continuing efforts to show the relevance of<br />\nthe popular world, the folk world, to our communal<br />\nsearch for truth and peace through the scholarly life, I<br />\nhave heard many a strange and tragic tale, but none so<br />\ntragic as the story of Antonio Sano (brother of Ruben<br />\nSano, the great Pachuco). As a youth Antonio watched the<br />\nMickey Mouse Club and fell in love with Annette. As he<br />\ngrew older Antonio's love obtained a degree of purity<br />\nand intensity worthy fo comparison to Dante's love for<br />\nBeatrice.<br />\nInspired by his love for Annette, Antonio turned to<br />\npoetry and showed great potential; indeed, it seemed to<br />\nmore than one observer that he was destined to replace<br />\nRod McKuen in the world of popular verse. But such,<br />\nalas, was not meant to be. One November eve he was<br />\ndriving back to his little hut up in the Sierra Nevada<br />\nMountains after having watched Beach Blanket Bingo on<br />\nhis mother's TV (for he never missed an Annette Funicello movie) when his car stalled as he was crossing a<br />\nrailroad track. A fast freight was coming downthe track;<br />\nAntonio's door was stuck and he was unable to escape<br />\nbefore the onrushing tide of fate swamped him. When<br />\nthe wrekage was cleared away, the poem which follows<br />\nwas found in an envelope addressed \"Annette Funicello,<br />\nc/o Walt Disney, Anaheim, California\" clutched in the<br />\nremains of his left hand.<br />\nIt is Antonio's last and greatest poem. Its deftly calculated rhythm, consumate choice of word and phrase,<br />\nand subtlety of allusion (mainly to the great romatics,<br />\nKeats, Shelley, Wordsworth, Coleridge and Jimi Hendrix)<br />\nqualify it as a masterpiece of its genre and perhaps as a<br />\nmasterpiece of 20th Century Literature. Therefore,without further academic commentary, I give you:<br />\nThe Four Seasons and Mary<br />\ndedicated to Annette<br />\nPrologue:<br />\nIt was eternal Summer and Autumn's breeze<br />\ncarressed your floating hair like<br />\n<br />\na delicately pointed snowflake alighting<br />\non a spring bubbling<br />\nfrom a virgin glade<br />\nin the freshmess of April.<br />\n--And the wind cries, Mary.<br />\nSpring:<br />\nWhen first I saw you, it was Spring and the birds<br />\nhad just begun, to sing.<br />\nYou were sitting amid some vernal boughs<br />\nPregnant, with life in delicate green buds.<br />\nYou saw me, and seeing<br />\ntook heart, and my hand:<br />\nI felt a deep thrill, as though, awakening within me<br />\nwere the very wellsprings of life.<br />\n--And the wind cries, Mary.<br />\nSummer:<br />\nThen Summer--an endless magic moment,<br />\nthe sun dancing on the sea foam,<br />\nthe sound of the waves mingling with your<br />\nbabbling voice-As though--I really don't know how to say this<br />\nfor words,obscure,and complicate<br />\nthe simplicity of true feeling-As though your life was one with the life of the sea<br />\nAnd your glittering eye fed off the sun-rays<br />\nand then, deep in the recesses of your soul,<br />\ngave back the light to the sun.<br />\n--And the wind cries, Mary.<br />\nFall:<br />\nSummer faded into Fall, the leaves<br />\nturned color and fell.<br />\nI saw in you a deep fullbodied richness, a mellowness<br />\nthat spoke of apple cider, pumpkin pie,<br />\nand, pure, maple syrup.<br />\nI came to know that there was more, to you, than<br />\nbright edged sun-rays of summerness;<br />\nand, alas, I saw that your autumnal fullness,<br />\nriding on the very crest of frost-tinged air,<br />\n<br />\nwas deeper, richer, than<br />\nthe summer gleam in my wan,<br />\nso very wan, eyes.<br />\n--And the wind cries, Mary.<br />\nWinter:<br />\nAnd so, the Autumn of my life eclipsed into Winter<br />\nand I felt, desolate, deserted-Oh why had love, and you, left me?<br />\nIn the forest a frozen pond reflected<br />\nmy inner coldness.<br />\nI looked<br />\ndeeper, and then,<br />\na gentle thrill melted my bones<br />\nFor beneath the ice I saw your blue eyes<br />\ntelling me that all,<br />\nAll was not lost.<br />\nFor love is deeper than a babbling brook in Spring<br />\nor a Summer of splendor in the grass;<br />\nLove lasts and lives to the naked<br />\nwinter trees etching their being into<br />\nwhite snow and<br />\ngrey winter skies.<br />\n--And the wind cries, Mary.<br />\nEpilogue:<br />\nNow, the winter wind speaks of truth<br />\nas a nightingale sings its high requiurn<br />\nof a midsummer's night to a blossoming cherry tree<br />\nin a Currier and Ives print hung above<br />\nan October fireplace.<br />\n--And the wind cires, Mary.<br />\nOn the last page of the manuscript the following note<br />\nwas scrawled, apparently written when he realized he<br />\ncouldn't escape from his car.<br />\n\"Dearest Annette, I have loved you always, I die only<br />\nto watch over you from<br />\n<br />\nCarl Jakob Joachim Benzor.<br />\n<br />\nMoog:Peabody's Electric Heart<br />\nUnceremoniously planted on a window-sill, d Moog synthesizer is the<br />\nheart of the Peabody Conservatory's<br />\nnew electronic music studio. The Moog,<br />\nand its brothers the Buchla and SynKet, is part of a second generation of<br />\nelectronic synthesizers in a field in<br />\nwhich many people never knew there<br />\nwas a first. But the window-sill-sized<br />\nMoog does almost all the same things<br />\nas the laboratory-sized Princeton (now<br />\nColumbia) RCA synthesizer of the sixties.<br />\nMrs. Jean Ivey, the director of the<br />\nPeabody's electronic music program,<br />\ndemonstrated what the Moog does. Each<br />\ninstrument is made to order and the<br />\nPeabody's has six oscillators which produce single tones and one \"white-sound\"<br />\nsource which produces an airy hiss.<br />\nThe sounds are modified with filters,<br />\na voltage control amplifier, and attenuators. A keyboard and a ribbon control, which is operated by sliding a<br />\nfinger along its length, can be used<br />\neither to switch from one pitch to another or to regulate dynamics.<br />\nHaving worked with a laboratory type<br />\nsynthesizer, Mrs. Ivey says she enjoys<br />\nthe compact size of the Moog because<br />\n\"it is designed with the composer in<br />\nmind.\" As a composer of both electronic and conventional music she finds<br />\nthe Moog more versatile than any live<br />\nperformer because it has greater dynamic and tonal range and can repro-<br />\n<br />\nduce more intricate rhythms. By combining the work of both composer and<br />\nperformer in one person, she said, the<br />\nMoog \"Makes the composer function<br />\nmore like a painter.\"<br />\n<br />\nComputer Drawbacks<br />\nA more recent development in the<br />\nfield of electronic music has been the<br />\nuse of computers to do the actual performing. Mrs. Ivey thinks this is a<br />\nthrowback to the days of the traditional<br />\ncomposer who could not hear what he<br />\nhad written until someone per ormed<br />\nit for him.

Hopkins second win in as many<br />\nstarts was the first time a varsity basketball team has beaten Gettysburg in<br />\nseventeen long years. The last time<br />\nwas in the 1951-52 season. Present<br />\nAthletic Director Marshall Turner was<br />\nthe coach then.<br />\nDown 64-62 with 3:42 left to play,<br />\nHopkins roared back after a timeout<br />\nto tie the score at 64 all with 3:32<br />\nleft. Dribbling right handed, then left<br />\nhanded, then behind his back, Hopkins'<br />\nflashy sophomore guard, George Apple,<br />\nwho had been picked up at three-quarters court, drove to within the foul<br />\nlane and pumped up the tieing basket.<br />\nApple iced the game with another two<br />\npointer with 17 second left to play.<br />\nApple's basket made the score 7066.

A rather<br />\ncontented rookie coach, Valvano mused,<br />\n\"I was very pleased with the team's<br />\ncomeback. These kids have got a lot<br />\nof pride in themselves. Winning is becoming a habit. Last night's game,<br />\nthe measure of the ball club, was important. We were up by as much as<br />\n18. The team came out and played with<br />\nall their heart. I can't say enough for<br />\nthe team. They won the ball game,<br />\nnot me. To get overly sentimental, it<br />\ntook a lot of courage to comeback the<br />\nway they did after being down with 3<br />\nminutes left.\"<br />\nGettysburg is classed as a major<br />\ncollege since it plays such powerhouses as Penn State and Rutgers and was<br />\nregarded as an excellant shooting team.<br />\nHopkins jumped off to a quick start.<br />\n<br />\nScoring readily on Gary Handleman's<br />\nand George Apple's shots, the Blue<br />\nJays went into the locerk room with a<br />\ndefinite 44-30 advantage.<br />\nIn the second half, however, Gettysburg staged a comeback and in the end<br />\nof the game made up an 18 point deficit. With 3:45 left on the clock, the<br />\nJays fell behind for the first time in<br />\nthe game by 2 points.<br />\n<br />\nHandleman Leads Scorers<br />\nHandleman led th Blue Jays scorers<br />\nwith 21 points, hitting on 8 for 15 from<br />\nthe floor and 5 of 6 from the foul line.<br />\nTied with him for game honors was<br />\nRoger Eppehimer of Gettysburg, who<br />\nwas also the game's top rebounder with<br />\n13. Apple, scoring 16 points, and Thomas, 13, were also high scorers for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIn team statistics, Hopkins shot 39%<br />\nwhile Gettysburg made 35% of his field<br />\ngoal attempts. The story o the game<br />\n<br />\nTankmen Turn in Record Performances<br />\nThe JHU swimmers performed admirably well last weekend. In a scrimmage against a strong Elizabethtown<br />\nteam, a team composed of both varsity<br />\nand frosh members swam several good<br />\nswims and defeated the visitors. Saturday, the varsity virtually swamped Lycoming, 72 to 23 in their first official<br />\nmeet of the season, and the same day<br />\nthe freshman team defeated a tough<br />\nopponent in their scrimmage with the<br />\nCardinal O'Hara High School of Philadelphia with a score of 49 to 46.<br />\nIn the E-Town meet, Hopkins fielded<br />\ntwo squads, an A team and a B team,<br />\nboth composed of varsity and frosh,<br />\nin order to give everyone a chance<br />\nto swim some tough competition. Hopkins took five firsts to place the A<br />\nteam at the top of the meet. In the 200<br />\nyard freestyle race, freshman Michael<br />\nBoyd placed first, setting a new frosh<br />\nrecord of 1:57.5, with another freshman,<br />\nVince Nigrelli taking second with a time<br />\nof 1:58.4 also under the old freshman<br />\nrecord.<br />\nIn the 50 and 100 yard free events,<br />\n<br />\nvarsity captain, Rick Ware surprised<br />\neveryone by taking a first and second<br />\nplace, respectively, after having been<br />\nout of the water for six weeks with a<br />\nvirus. His return was a welcome addition to team strength.<br />\n<br />\nRecords Fall<br />\nFirst in the 11 free, was Vince Nigrelli<br />\nwith a time of 52.8. a second ahead of<br />\nWare. Michael Boyd went out in the 500<br />\nfree race and broke the frosh and varsity records he had set two weeks before<br />\nagainst Navy with a time of 5:21.8.<br />\nJunior Mare Solomon followed up with a<br />\nsecond place in that event.<br />\nAnother surprise for the weekend<br />\ncame in the diving when Ken Zonies<br />\ntook firsts against both E-Town and Lycoming.

Last month in Baltimore<br />\nfour Panthers were jailed on conspiracy charges and<br />\ntraffic violations.<br />\nPolice in Los Angeles said that there was no connection between their raid and the events in other cities.<br />\nTheir raid began about 330 a.m. Monday as the police<br />\nfirst cordoned off a 16 block area before moving in on<br />\nthe Panthers headquarters. According to a department<br />\nspokesman, the squad announced that they had warrants<br />\nto search the building. After receiving no answer, they<br />\nsaid they kicked down the door and were met by a volley<br />\nof bullets wounding 2 policemen.<br />\nThree hundred officers then spent the night exchanging<br />\nsporadic fire with the Panthers. They began lobbing tear<br />\ngas canisters into the building and in a space of an hour<br />\nflushed out 11 Panthers. The raid was conducted, according to the police, in search of illegal weapons and two<br />\nPanthers wanted on assault charges. Said one in the<br />\ncrowd, \"They aren't moving against the Black Panthers<br />\nalone, they're moving against the whole black nation.<br />\nAnyone who can't see this is a racist thing is crazy.\"<br />\n<br />\n...And Chicago<br />\nDozens of black community organizations, along with<br />\nsome predominately white civic groups, called this week<br />\nfor independent investigations of what happened when 15<br />\npolicemen assigned to the Illinois State's Attorney's<br />\noffice raided a West Side Chicago apartment at 440 a.m.<br />\nlast Thursday morning.<br />\nThe police have asserted that a woman opened fire on<br />\nthem with a shotgun, touching off a \"shoot-out\" lasting<br />\nat least 10 minutes. During the shootout, the 21-year-old<br />\nleader of the Illinois Black Panther party and another<br />\nPanther leader were shot to death. Charles Garry, the<br />\nwhite attorney for the black organization, maintained that<br />\na campaign of \"genocide\" is being carried out against<br />\nthe Panthers by the government.<br />\nThe Panthers charged that Fred Hampton, the chairman of the state's Panthers, had been \"murdered in his<br />\n<br />\nbed.\" They contended that the police had burst into the<br />\napartment and began shooting, and that no one else had<br />\na chance to shoot. The areas in the apartment where the<br />\npolice were last Thursday are clear of bullet holes. The<br />\nareas where the Panthers were are riddled.<br />\nAsked about the lack of bullet holes in the areas of the<br />\napartment where the official account said that the police<br />\nofficers had been under heavy fire, Edward Hanrahn,<br />\nCook County State's Attorney, replied, \"I don't believe<br />\nthe assumption that underlies that question is correct.<br />\nI don't think your observations were accurate, if that is<br />\nwhat you found.\" Asked why the police, who had equipped<br />\nthemselves with a submachinegun, had not brought tear<br />\ngas, he said, \"We took the precautions we believed were<br />\nappropriate for effecting that search warrant.\"<br />\nAsked why the raid was carried out at 4:40 a.m., he<br />\nstated, \"We believed that it was effected at an appropriate time.\" \"We have given our statement,\" he ended.<br />\n<br />\nthat stated that if groups or individuals continued to<br />\ndecide for themselves which laws were objectionable,<br />\n\"we shall face nationwide disobedience of many laws,<br />\nand thus, anarchy.\" They said that an individual or a<br />\nsmall group should test any law considered unconstitutional, and that all other dissenters should abide by the<br />\nlaw in question until it is invalidated by the courts.<br />\nThe six opponents of the majority, including Chairman<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower, hold that disobedience to civil<br />\nlaw, when there was a willing acceptance of the penaltY,<br />\nmight at times be the only means of disposing of unjust<br />\nlaws or policies of the government.<br />\n\"Willingness to incur the wrath and punishment of<br />\ngovernment,\" Mrs. Patrica Harris, professor of law at<br />\nHoward University, contended,\"can represent the highest<br />\nloyality and respect for a democratic society.Such respect<br />\nand self-sacrifice may well prevent, rather than cause,<br />\nviolence.\" Mrs. Harris and Judge Leon Higginbotham<br />\nwere the only two Negores on the violence commission.<br />\nBoth claimed that with the majority's prescription for<br />\ntesting unjust laws would never have won the civil rights<br />\nlegislation enacted in the 1960's under the impetus of<br />\ncivil disobedience.<br />\nThe commission was unanimous, however, in finding<br />\nthat among the mass demonstrators of today are \"some<br />\nof the most destructive elements in American society.\"<br />\n\"Only naive and willful blindness can obscure the strength<br />\nof these dark forces, which, but for the loosening of the<br />\nbonds of the law, might otherwise lie quiescent beneath<br />\nthe surface of our national life.\"<br />\n<br />\nCoed Quiverings<br />\nThe Task Force on Coeducation issued a recommendation this week that the question of allowing girls' admission to the freshman class next year be reconsidered.<br />\nPreviously, President Gordon suggested, and the Board<br />\nof Trustees approved, that only sophomore and junior<br />\ntransfer women be admitted to Hopkins in September.<br />\nThe Admissions Office has yet to begin active recruitment of female transfer students. About 150 girls<br />\nIn the last month have sent in written requests for information pertaining to admission. The Office said it will<br />\nnot begin recruitment until the decision of whether or<br />\nnot to allow in freshmen women is made.<br />\nThere are currently four plans to house the women.<br />\nOne is to have them live off-campus, and is considered<br />\nundesireable. Another plan is to redo either two freshmen or upper class dorms to facilitate the women.<br />\nChanging two freshmen dorms would cost about $40,000,<br />\nthe upper class dorns would be substantially more.

Benton will replace Allyn W. Kimball as Dean of<br />\nthe Faculty of Arts and Sciences<br />\nat the end of this academic year.<br />\nThe appointment, effective July<br />\n1, was announced Tuesday by<br />\nLincoln Gordon. Dean Kimball<br />\nasked to be relieved of the deanship approximately one month<br />\nago. He says that he wants to<br />\nreturn to teaching and research in<br />\nthe university's Department of Biostatistics, where he formerly served<br />\nas chairman.<br />\nDr. Benton is currently a Professor of Meteorology and Chairman<br />\nof the Department of Earth and<br />\nPlanetary Sciences. He has been .a<br />\nmember of the Hopkins faculty<br />\nsince 1948.<br />\nGordon called Benton \"a scholar<br />\nand administrator of well-deserved<br />\ninternational reputation, who has<br /><br />\nmade important contributions to<br />\nscientific knowledge.\" Gordon<br />\nadded that Hopkins was \"indeed<br />\nfortunate to have found within its<br />\nranks a man so eminently qualified<br />\nto assume the deanship.\"<br />\nDifficult Decision<br />\nBenton was approached with the<br />\noffer three weeks ago,and decided<br />\nto accept the appointment last<br />\nweek. He states that the decision<br />\nto accept the post was 'a difficult<br />\none for him to make. \"Someone in<br />\nmy position gives up an awful lot,\"<br />\nwhen taking an administrative<br />\npost, he said. Benton believes he<br />\nwill be able to devote very little<br />\ntime to his academic specialty<br />\nwhile he serves as Dean.<br />\nKimball said that when he accepted the post of Dean, he<br />\nthought that he would be able to<br />\nmaintain some activity in his role<br /><br />\nas professor. He found, however,<br />\nthat this was impossible during<br />\nhis four years in Gilman Hall.<br />\nKimball estimates that he put in<br />\nseventy to eighty hours per week<br />\nin his job. Gordon referred to the<br />\ndeanship as \"a man-killing job.\"<br />\nBenton is familiar with the duties of a top-level administrator, if<br />\nnot with those of the Homewood<br />\ndeanship. For three years, until<br />\nlast September, he was director of<br />\nResearch Laboratories of the<br />\nEnvironmental Science Services<br />\nAdministration of the Department<br />\nof Commerce while on leave from<br />\nHopkins. From the ESSA research<br />\nlaboratories in Boulder, Colorado,<br />\nhe directed research efforts in the<br />\nenvironmental sciences at fifteen<br />\nlaboratories throughout the country.<br /><br />\nLanguage Requirements Removed<br />\nBy A. MICHAEL HILL<br />\nThe Academic Council last week<br />\nabolished the University-wide foreign language requirement, effective as of July 1, 1970.<br />\nThe council acted on a recommendation from the Committee<br />\non Undergraduate Studies. The<br />\naction removes the previous requirement of one year beyond the<br />\nelements of a foreign language<br />\nwhich was necessary for the B.A.<br />\ndegree.<br />\nThis move does not prevent the<br />\nvarious departments from requiring a foreign language in order to<br />\nget a degree majoring in that department. The Committee on Undergraduate Studies will decide<br />\nwhat language requirements are<br />\nnecessary for the area majors.<br />\nNo Deadline<br />\nAlthough no deadline has been<br />\nset for the decisions, Dean Kimball<br />\nstated that he hoped that they<br />\nwould be made quickly. Dean<br />\nSwanson, chairman of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies,<br />\nsaid that a preliminary sounding<br />\nout of the faculty indicated that<br />\nthe Humanities area major would<br />\nkeep some foreign language requirement. He stressed that any<br />\ndecisions that his committee<br />\nmakes will be in consultation with<br /><br />\nDr. William McClain: \"There is no<br />\nreason\" for retaining the language<br />\nrequirement.<br />\nphoto by Lernm<br /><br />\nthe faculties of the various areas,<br />\nand that, in essence, the decision<br />\nis up to the faculty.<br />\nImprove Morale<br />\nDr. Elias L. Rivers, chairman of<br />\nthe Department of Romance Languages, stated that \"A majority of<br />\nmy department was in favor of the<br />\nmove.\" He felt that it would \"improve morale, both among graduates and undergraduates.\"<br /><br />\nDr. William McClain, chairman<br />\nof the German Department said<br />\n\"We were not in favor of retaining<br />\nit as there is no reason for it.\" He<br />\ndid feel that this change would<br />\n\"put special responsibilities on advisers as it is possible that-a student might not get the language<br />\n\"needed for graduate study.\" Dr.<br />\nMcClain also pointed out that the<br />\nAcademic Council's action was<br />\ngoing to allow the German department to make several curriculumchanges. Next year there will be<br />\nfour intermediate level courses,<br />\none emphasizing contemporary fiction, one in conversation, one in<br />\nscientific German, and another<br />\ndesigned for people going to the<br />\nintermediate level directly from<br />\nhigh school. Dr. McClain stated<br />\nthat \"We welcome the oppOrtunity to teach new things.\"<br />\nFree Time for Grads<br />\nDr. Rivers also indicated the<br />\npossibility of curriculum changes<br />\nin the Romance Languages, perhaps including the institution of an<br />\nintensive first-year course. But, he<br />\nfelt that the action would mainly<br />\n\"mean more free time for graduate<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nThe phrasing of the resolution<br />\npassed by the Academic council<br />\nmeans_ that everyone who grad,(Continued on page 5)<br /><br />\nNewly-appointed Dean George Benton will \"see that enough time and effort are spent in determining a direction.\"<br /><br />\nBenton noted two major questions which must be answered in<br />\nthe coming years. First, the role of<br />\nthe university in the changing<br />\nsociety must be determined; and<br />\nsecond, the role which Hopkins<br />\nitself must play has also to be<br />\ndecided. He sees his role as Dean<br />\nrevolving around an effort to \"see<br />\nthat enough time and effort is<br />\nspent in determining a direction.\"<br />\nHe says that Hopkins provides<br />\nopportunities unique among American universities. He cited Hopkins'<br />\nsize, labelling it the \"smallest of<br />\nthe true universities.\" This small<br />\nsize, he says, gives this university a<br />\ngreater flexibility than is commonly found. Hopkins is \"still malleable,\" he said.<br />\n\"Life's Too Short\"<br />\nBenton declined to specify what<br />\nchanges might occur when he assumes the deanship. He said that<br />\nhe did not want to enter his job<br />\nwith fixed conceptions. In many,<br />\nmatters, he said, he would be<br />\nswayed by those who advised him<br />\nand by the opinion of the majority of those concerned in decisions. \"If you can't (defer to the<br />\nmajority) you get the hell out,<br />\nright?\" He continued. \"It's no fun<br />\nworking for something you don't<br />\nbelieve in, and life's too short not<br />\nto have fun.\"<br />\nThe new Dean may face a<br />\ndifficult situation, his background<br />\nnot including the humanities and<br />\nsocial sciences; coeducation could<br />\nmean a shift in the emphasis of<br />\nHopkins' program toward ,the<br />\nhumanities and social sciences.<br />\nBenton acknowledges that this<br />\nmay cause problems. \"I think that<br />\nI would naturally have problems,\"<br />\n(Continued on page 4)<br /><br />\nDec. 12, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 2<br /><br />\nMcGovern: 'Silent Majority' Unpatriotic<br />\nIn an interchange laced with liberal<br />\nrhetoric and humor, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota last Sunday night<br />\ncalled the younger generation \"perhaps<br />\nthe most sensitive and intelligent and<br />\nalert group this country has ever produced.\"<br />\nSenator McGovern spoke in Baltimore<br />\nSunday at the Forum Series of the Temple<br />\nOheb Shalom.

The work necessary to end<br />\nthe war in Vietnam cannot be restricted to the areas where we have already<br />\nbeen active.\"<br />\nTown meetings are being held in<br />\ntwenty-six cities across the country.<br />\nThese meetings will be held in conjunction with the Coalition on National Prio-<br /><br />\nrites and Military Spending. The theme<br />\nof these assemblies will be \"Local Needs<br />\nand Military Spending.\"<br /><br />\nOld Poly<br />\nThe two peace groups have chosen<br />\nBaltimore as the site of Maryland's<br />\nactivities. On Sunday, December 14<br />\na \"town meeting\" is scheduled at the<br />\nCalvert Educational Center (old Poly<br />\nTechnical High School)., The Coalition,<br />\nlocally coordinated by the Rev. N. Ellsworth Bunce, takes most of the responsibility for this action. The Moratorium holds only a subordinate role.<br />\nThe Hopkins Peace Action Committee<br />\nhas planned no activities for December. Jim Cleary, who heads the group<br />\nalong with George Lipman, maintains<br />\nthat exams preclude any campus moratorium action.<br />\nConsidering the lack of student interest<br />\non campus on November 13 and 14,<br />\nCleary reflects doubt on the possibilities<br />\nfor a successful moratorium. A weak<br />\neffort would not be a \"bigger and better<br />\none, which is the whole idea of the moratorium,\" he says.<br /><br />\nMaryland politicians have been invited<br />\nto attend the \"town meeting\". Governor Marvin Mandel, Congressman Clarence Long and Samuel Friedel, Mayor<br />\nThomas D'Alesandro of Baltimore, and<br />\nmany other state and city officials plan<br />\nto attend. The politicians will be there<br />\nto listen, not to speak.<br />\nAt the Baltimore meeting more than<br />\nthirty groups, ranging from the United<br />\nAuto Workers Union to the conservationist Sierra Club, will offer testimony<br />\nof the domestic effects of the war. Each<br />\norganization will have three minutes to<br />\nexplain a problem and then to suggest a<br />\nsolution.<br /><br />\nFinancing Future Wars<br />\nThe military takes seventy cents<br />\nof every tax dollar, according to Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick, town meeting chairman.<br />\nNineteen cents goes to the war in Viet<br />\nNam, he continued, while the rest is<br />\n\"split between paying for past wars and<br />\nfinancing for future ones.\" Fitzpatrick<br />\ncontends that the high level of military<br />\nspending causes important problems on<br />\nthe American scene to go neglected.<br /><br />\nrently owes the Baltimore Gas and<br />\nElectric Company $600 for the three<br />\nbuildings they inhabit. They failed to pay<br />\ntheir bills during the period February to<br />\nSeptember, and the company cut off service to two of the buildings last month.<br />\nTwenty-three undergraduates, grad<br />\nstudents and professors signed a letter<br />\ncondemning the \"political repression\"<br />\ncurrently being waged against this militant Negro group. \"The repressive,<br />\nextra-legal nature of this attack (on the<br />\nPanthers) is a threat to the basis of personal liberty and the rights to association<br />\nand dissent,\" the open letter stated.<br />\nThe signers included Jim Archibald.<br />\nSA President, Bob Cotter, Grad Organization President, John Guess, SC President and Greg Thomas, President of the<br />\nBlack Students Union. Drs.

Last<br />\nDecember, Zeke Boyd, formerly a major<br />\nin the Panthers, was circulating Black<br />\nPanther literature at the Trailways Bus<br />\nStation. Two terminal policemen asked<br />\nhim to stop circulating the pamphlets, he<br />\nrefused, walked away and was maced.<br />\nZeke was later charged with resisting<br />\narrest and disorderly conduct. In both<br />\ncharges he was found not guilty.<br />\nIn early March, five Panthers were<br />\nstopped and searched by approximately<br />\ntwenty policemen as they were walking<br />\npast a school one block from their headquarters. The police charged them with<br />\nconduct, trespassing on<br />\ndisorderly<br />\nschool property, and interfering with the<br />\nduties of a police officer. Bail money<br />\nwas paid, but the charges were dropped<br />\nbefore the case went to court.<br />\nThese two incidents, according to their<br />\nlawyer, William Zinman, were cases of<br />\n\"pure harassment.\" He stated that it is<br />\nthese incidents that the Wickwire committee will try to prevent in the future,<br />\n\"We're going to try to stop the police<br />\nGestapo methods now being used,\" Zinman remarked, \"and demonstrate that<br />\noverkill by police authorities will only<br />\n(Continued on page 5)<br /><br />\nPIAGE 4<br /><br />\n\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nDec. 12, 1969<br /><br />\n*******************;<br />\nN ;(*****-***<br /><br />\n*Benton Gets Deanship;<br />\n*************************<br />\n* Faces Financial Bind<br />\nSteer<br /><br />\nGodfrey's<br /><br />\nand<br />\nBeer<br />\n**************************<br />\nGRAND OPENING TOMORROW!<br />\nFamous For...<br />\nPizza<br />\nBeef Sandwiches<br />\nDraft Beer in Frosted Mugs<br />\nCarry-Out, too!<br /><br />\nKA'MAT<br />\nDID VIM<br />\nAVNO6PAVA<br />\nmeet all the gang at... *<br /><br />\nGodfrey's Steer &amp; Beer ))<br />\n3226 Greenmount Ave.<br />\n(near 33rd st.)<br />\n*********************<br /><br />\n(From page 1)<br />\nhe<br />\nsaid, \"in<br />\ntrying<br />\nto<br />\nunderstand the<br />\nfields<br />\nwhich<br />\nare not within<br />\nmy own disciplines<br />\nHowever,<br />\nhe<br />\nnoted that no<br />\nman<br />\ncould<br />\nhave<br />\nknowledge of<br />\nall<br />\ndisciplines and<br />\nthat any incoming<br />\nDean<br />\nwould experience the same<br />\ndifficulties.<br />\nDean Kimball<br />\nlabelled<br />\nthe<br />\nsupposed<br />\nshift in empDEAN ALLYN W.

The revisions include the reorganization of several of the old courses, as well as the<br />\ninstitution of several new ones.<br />\nTo replace the old Chemistry 1-2<br />\nand Physics 1-2 introductory sequence,<br />\nand the present Modern Physics course,<br />\na two-year General Physics course<br />\nhas been designed, encompassing most<br />\nof the material included in the scrapped<br />\ncourses. It includes a one -semester<br />\nChemistry lab.<br /><br />\nNew Courses<br />\nThe Physics Department's intermediate courses have been made into onesemester courses. This includes Optics and Thermodynamics, which were<br />\nboth formerly full-year courses. The<br />\nsole exception to this rule in Electromagnetic Theory, which is still a fullyear course.<br /><br />\nIn addition to these revamped old courses, a number of new courses are being<br />\noffered. Three courses intended primarily for Physics majors are new; these<br />\nare: Atomic and Molecular Structure,<br />\nNuclear and Particle Physics, and Topics<br />\nin Astrophysic. Also, all the old lab<br />\ncourses have been consolidated into one<br />\nfull-year course to be taken by Juniors.<br />\nFor the first time, courses are also<br />\nbeing offered for non-Physical science<br />\nmajors. A General Physics for Biology majors is planned. Also new are<br />\na course in Astronomy and a course in<br />\nConcepts In Physics and Mathematics,<br />\nboth of which are intended for nonscience majors. Neither course has any<br />\nprerequisites.<br />\nConcepts in Physics and Mathematics<br />\nwill use an historical approach to introduce its ideas. Accordingto the course's<br />\narchitect, Dr. George Owen, the specific<br />\nsubject matter taught will depend in large<br />\npart on the interests of the class. Routine<br />\n\"mathematical drudgery\" will not enter<br />\nthe picture.<br />\nThe most interesting new addition to<br />\nthe Physics curriculum, however, is a<br />\ntwo semester course in Mathematical<br /><br />\nMethods in Physics.<br />\nThis course may, at the option of the<br />\nstudent, replace two of the four Math<br />\ncourses required of Physics majors.<br />\nThe course is the result of a longstanding dissatisfaction with the job the<br />\nMath Department has been doing of providing Physics students with the mathematical tools they used.<br />\nDr. Owen emphasized that he did not<br />\nintend to imply the Math Department<br />\nis either lazy or incompetent. Rather,<br />\ntheir orientation is towards the theoretical, or \"philosophical\" aspects of<br />\nmathematics, and not towards applied<br />\nmathematics. This move by the Physics Department may set a precedent<br />\nfor similar changes in other Departments, although the acquisition of any<br />\nsignificant numbers of faculty in Applied Mati-ematics would of course have<br />\nto be with the consent and cooperation<br />\nof the Math Department.<br />\nThis new program is designed to give<br />\nthe Physics student a wider choice in<br />\nthe courses available to him in his last<br />\ntwo years, and to render less painful<br />\nand more to-the-point, his studies in<br />\nfields allied to Physics.<br /><br />\nJHU Language<br />\nRequirement<br />\nEnds in July<br />\n(Continued from page 1)<br />\nuates after June, 1970 will not have to<br />\nfulfill the requirement. This year's<br />\nSeniors still come under the old rule.<br /><br />\n\"Anomalous\"<br />\nDean Kimball stated that, as were the<br />\nUniversity's last requirements, he felt<br />\nthat it was somewhat \"anomalous,\" but<br />\nthat foreign languages were necessary<br />\nfor some fields and he hoped in these<br />\nareas requirements would be strengthened.<br />\nThe dropping of this requirement<br />\nleaves only the physical education requirement as a University pre-requisite<br />\nfor graduation. Otherwise everything is<br />\nleft up to the departments in deciding<br />\nthe requirements for their majors, or,<br />\nin the case of area majors, it is left up<br />\nto the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies.

Last week<br />\nthe Panther Minister of Education, Tchak Zulu,was arrested as<br />\na convicted felon for carrying a<br />\nweapon.

The traditional concept of the<br />\nseason is one of conviviality, reflection, joy and hopes of a better time to<br />\ncome.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Christian tendencies of this nation are rapidly falling<br />\nbefore the onslaught of a vast politicization of its minority groups and the<br />\nequally great shift of the government's emphasis from control to repression<br />\nand from action to reaction. Instead of providing the leadership of this<br />\nnation that its citizens expect, the Federal government is becoming more<br />\nand more entwined in 'extra-curricular' activities--such as counting and<br />\ncomparing the number of pro-war and anti-war letters it receives\u2014which<br />\nserve only to divide the nation further and not reach any conclusive<br />\nanswers.<br />\nVice President Agnew's remarks here in Baltimore are, as usual, relevant<br />\nto this point. After discarding his prepared speech, in which he took a long<br />\nlook at American education, he delivered ten minutes of off-the-cuff<br />\nremarks aimed, once again, at demonstrators. \"Where a majority of<br />\npeople,\" he said, \"has spoken in a free election, it is not salutary...to<br />\nresort to this constant harangue on the campus and streets.\" Nixon's 1968<br />\nplurality has now become a majority.<br />\nWhat the Vice President continually fails to ask himself is why minorities<br />\nare taking to the streets and to the campuses. This country, more than any<br />\nother, has traditionally been made up of minorities, and these minority<br />\ninterests have traditionally been forced to take account of each other.<br />\nThe difference now is that, unlike the Italians and the Poles and the Irish,<br />\nneither the young nor the Negroes are considered legitimate minority<br />\ngroups. They are thought of as dissidents, and whereas a minority interest<br />\nis something to be dealt with, dissidence is equated with anarchy and<br />\nsubversion.<br />\nThe ironic aspect of Mr. Agnew's remarks is that the prepared speech<br />\nwhich he released to the press had a.completely different ring to it, and,<br />\nhad it been used, might have gone a long way toward showing some groups<br />\nthat the administration really is interested in tackling some of its major<br />\nproblems in a positive manner. In that speech he said, \"If we are not going<br />\nto have revolutionary look at our institutions of education.\" He also noted<br />\nthat the government should consider changing the institutions to make<br />\nthem \"Fit the public rather than make the public fit the institutions.\"<br />\nOf course, it must be remembered that the speech was not delivered.<br />\nIn other areas, too, Christmas tidings are equally bleak. It is becoming<br />\nevident that the running battle between the Black Panthers and the<br />\nnation's police departments has a very interested onlooker in the person of<br />\nAttorney General- Mitchell, and that harassment of the Panthers is rapidly<br />\nchanging into a sophisticated attempt to eradicate the party through<br />\nviolent means.<br />\nThe. tax bill issue which is presently being fought out in Congress is<br />\ndegenerating into a sharp political battle, the results of which are likely to<br />\ncut Federal spending in the domestic sector even more, and drive the<br />\ninflation even higher.<br />\nAnd, on the war front, indications are that the President's next withdrawal will again only involve 35,000 troops and that the level of the<br />\nfighting will not lessen appreciably. By all admissions, the Paris peace talks<br />\nare deadlocked and not reaching any solutions.<br />\nMerry Christmas\u2014and a happy new decade.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER WILL BE PUBLISHING A<br />\nSPECIAL \"END OF THE DECADE\" ISSUE<br />\nEARLY NEXT WEEK IN TRIBUTE TO THE '60'S.<br />\nBE PREPARED.<br />\neditors-in-chief<br />\nbusiness manager<br /><br />\nRichard B.

And yet,<br />\nthe presence of ROTC on our campus<br />\nis the University's stamp of approval<br />\non military solutions to social problems.<br />\nROTC has no place on our campus, and<br />\nwe, the students, faculty and administrators who make up this community<br />\nshould immediately withdraw our support for antiquated military solutions.<br />\nLet us concentrate on the process of<br />\nfinding Human solutions to 20th century<br />\nproblems of population ctronl, environmental pollution, and improvement of<br />\nthe life conditions for all inhabitants of<br />\nthis, our Earth. NOW is the time,<br />\nthe time is NOW!<br />\nPeace,<br /><br />\nDavid H. Fankhauser, Biology<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn the responses to my factual letters<br />\n(News - Letter, Nov. '7 &amp; 14), no one<br /><br />\nhas disputed that ROTC at Hopkins is a<br />\nnon-academic, extracurricular activity<br />\n\"serving\" a dwindling minority of Hopkins students. The inordinate amount of<br />\nspace such an activity occupies at a<br />\ncmpus where space is at a premium,<br />\nthe University contribution to an effort<br />\nof dubious value in times of financial<br />\nstress, and the contractural obligations<br />\nto the program need straightforward<br />\nand total reconsideration.<br />\n(1) ROTC is none of our business.<br />\nThis is a typical Army attitude expressed by Colonel Parmly, and is one reason ROTC does not belong on this campus. Yes, my correspondents, I agree<br />\nthat ROTC should not be a business of<br />\nthis university. This leads me to point<br />\n#2.<br />\n(2) The ROTC contract. This is a<br />\ncontract between the Army and the<br />\nUniversity; it is certainly not a contract<br />\nbetween the Army and the Army! Anyone<br />\ndesiring a copy of the contract can<br />\nreceive one from me for 10 zeroxing<br />\ncosts; see for yourself that this contract violates numerous Hopkins procedures and principles. the Academic<br />\nCouncil should forthwith recommend termination of this contract; one academic<br />\nyear's notice of such intent is required<br />\nin the contract.<br />\n(3) Faculty and Administration are unknowledgeable. Many of use have taken<br />\nROTC, served in the Armed Forces,<br />\nperused the Army-dictated ROTC course<br />\noutlines, and observed ROTC on this<br />\ncampus for a number of years. We<br />\ndidn't arrive last September fresh out<br />\nof high school!<br />\n(4) ROTC \"serves\" a waning minority.<br />\nMy letters pointed out, and Colonel<br />\nParmly agrees, that there has been a<br />\ndrastic reduction in ROTC participation by Hopkins students. I pointed out<br />\nthat this was a long-term trend and<br />\naccurately presented data compiled from<br />\nthe \"Report of the Professor of Military Science\" that appears annually as<br />\npart of the \"Report of the Faculties<br />\n(Continued on page 9)<br /><br />\nPAGE 9<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nDec. 12, 1969<br /><br />\nOn the Honor Commission<br />\n\"An article on the effects of the honor<br />\ncommission at Hopkins? Sorry,we can't<br />\nrun any completely blank spaces in the<br />\npaper.\"<br />\nEveryone here at Hopkins lives under<br />\nthe Honor Code; all of us have signed that<br />\nPledge on the application form to abide<br />\nby the code. Most of us have taken that<br />\ntest in Freshman year, heard those<br />\nfreshman<br />\norientation lectures, and<br />\nCheated, or attempted to, on exams.<br />\nSome people do, however, come before<br />\nthe Honor Commission on charges of<br />\ncheating.<br />\nJohn R.: 'Hello, this is Pete McGinn<br />\nand I've been told that you selected me<br />\nas your defense counsel for the honor<br />\ncommission trial.'

I thought we could<br />\nget together some time and discuss it.\"<br />\nSeems Reasonable. \"Lets do it.\"<br />\nArrangements are made. I learn of<br />\nthe situation and he learns my side of<br />\nthe story. Very reasonable.<br /><br />\nThe Commission<br />\nThe Honor Commission is made up<br /><br />\nthe Honor Commission members, who<br />\nare aware of the problem, at the Hopkins community.<br />\nSitting on the trial panel is supposed to be easy if the student pleads<br />\nguilty; he admits in that case the righteousness of the system, or at least there<br />\nis the implication in his actions that the<br />\nHonor Commission has the right to have<br />\npower over him. The panel merely has<br />\nto find the accused guilty and decide what<br />\npenalty would best serve both the individual and the community as a whole.<br />\nThe qualms come when it is realized<br />\nthat the Commission member who voted<br />\nfor guilt in the afternoon, could quite<br />\npossibly go home that night and watch<br />\nhis roommate cheat on a physics lab.<br />\nNo member of the community is required by the Honor Code to turn in violators of the Honor Code. As one student,<br />\nbefore<br />\nthe<br />\nHonor Commission on<br />\ncharges, put it:<br /><br />\nof 22 members; 7 of the members sit<br />\non any trial board. Seven fellows, not<br />\nunlike you or I, sit and judge their fellow students, having literally, at this<br />\nuniversity, the power of life and death.<br />\nFor the Honor Commission, if it finds<br />\na student guilty, can give a penalty ranging from blacklisting (which means that<br />\nif they catch you again you're in trouble), to mandatory withdrawal from the<br />\ncourse, to failure in the course, to expulsion from the University (for a second offense).<br />\nLet he who is blameless cast the first<br />\nstone. I am unaware if anyone brought<br />\nthe commission on charges of \"unfair<br />\nadvantage\" has ever hurled that epithet<br />\nat the trial board. Or, rather than at<br /><br />\nLetters To The Editors<br />\n(Continued from page 8)<br />\nAdministration\". The University<br />\nCirculars are in the library, and anyone may check my figures which are<br />\nfor \"final enrollments\" in ROTC. I<br />\ngave ROTC<br />\nthe benefit of the doubt.<br />\nFor example, in 1968's report there<br />\nIs the statement: \"Retention of freshmen to completion of MS I showed<br />\ncontinued improvement (70 of 89).\" On<br />\nthe next page the same report states<br />\nthat 26 freshmen withdrew from the<br />\nprogram and that the final enrollment<br />\nwas 79. I kindly used the figure of 79.<br />\nAt least the final total<br />\nenrollment<br />\nfor 1968 (206) is close to Colonel Farm1's \"Corrected\" figure (205). how'<br />\never, Colonel Parmly's \"corrected,<br />\nfigures for other recent years run over<br />\nthose published in the annual reports<br />\nby 29% for 1967 (35% padding if nonHopkins students are excluded), 61% for<br />\n1966, 43% for 1965, 11% for 1964, and<br />\n36% for 1963. In any event, either set<br />\nof figures substantiates one main point<br />\nof my letters, namely that interest in<br />\nROTC has dropped substantially in the<br />\n1960's, beginning before the pressures<br />\nof Vietnam and continuing since.<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\n(5) ROTC is becoming \"efficient\". In<br />\nresponse to may data relating to extremely low ROTC retention rates (e.g. 14%<br />\nfor 1967 graduates) and attendant waste<br />\nof effort, Colonel Parmly points out<br />\nROTC's increasing efficienty. He speaks<br />\nof detention rates, not retention rates.<br />\nIf efficienty is an $80 billion military<br />\nbudget that pumps scholarship money<br />\ninto pockets of those willing to sign<br />\nArmy contracts rather than to support<br /><br />\n\"MC P6F6NPAOT A1-1.e6E5<br />\nThis COURT HAS DEPeIvED<br />\nI-11M OF H15<br />\nCoNSTrrU-<br /><br />\nthose most in need....then ROTC is becoming more efficient. If efficiency is<br />\na terrible war with the threat of Army<br />\ninduction....then ROTC is becoming more<br />\nefficient. The Army purports that select deferments allow additional training<br />\nwhich benefits the Armed Services by<br />\nproviding experienced manpower. And<br />\nwhat, may I ask, about the rest of the<br />\nNation's endeavors that are as critical<br />\nand often more important for a strong<br />\nAmerica: It at first seems enigmatic<br />\nto hear ene actually brag about ROTC's<br />\npower to protect a select group anxious<br />\nto post-pone military service, but might<br />\none expect this of an individualncommitted to the Army rather than to the University?<br />\n(6) ROTC is extracurricular. For 2<br />\nyears ROTC has been a non-academic<br />\nactivity at Hopkins, but little has been<br />\ndone to place it in this perspective.<br />\nThe Undergraduate Studies Committee<br />\nshould see that Military Science courses<br />\nare eliminated totally from all academic<br />\nrecords of students entering hereafter.<br />\nFurthermore, this same rule should<br />\napply to any currently enrolled student<br />\nwho requests that Military Science not<br />\nbe recorded on his transcript. Such a<br />\nmove would allow withdrawal from ROTC<br />\nwithout an F on the academic record for<br />\na non-academic activity in the case of<br />\nFor example,<br />\nJuniors and Seniors.<br />\nstudents with favorable draft numbers or<br />\nwho for other reasons change their minds<br />\nduring their Hopkins tenure would feel<br />\nmore free to pursue individual interests.<br />\nFurthermore, all descriptions of military Science should be removed from<br /><br />\n0A0<br /><br />\nVEFEK)12AMIT<br /><br />\n\"Personal Needs\"?<br /><br />\nthe academic portion of the University<br />\nCircular of Undergraduate Programs,<br />\nand it should be made clear to prospective students that academic credit is<br />\nnot given. A short entry on ROTC, in<br />\nkeeping with those for other student<br />\nactivities, can be placed in \"The Hopkins Campus and Student Life\" section.<br />\nCertain portions of the current ROTC<br />\nwrite-up are in definite conflict with<br />\nuniversity policy and require outright<br />\nelimination, for example: \"Students enrolling in the ROTC program agree to<br />\ncomplete the Basic Course (freshman<br />\nand sophomore years) as a prerequisite<br />\nto graduation, unless relieved of the<br />\nobligation by competent authority.\" Finally, military personnel assigned to<br />\nHopktns should be stricken from the list<br />\nof Faculty at the end of the Circular<br />\nsince this is essentially a list of the<br />\nteaching staff in the Faculty of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br /><br />\n\"The point that never seems to get<br />\nacross in the psuedo-intellectual orientation talks about the Honor Code is<br />\nthat an individual has as a responsibility to not only himself, but also to<br />\nhis fellow students. It is often understood as a decision reflecting only on<br />\nthe personal needs and wants of the individual. It ignores the responsibility<br />\nthat the individual owes to others. An<br />\nindividual has to realize that his actions<br />\nare not independent of the society around him. A personal moral code is<br />\nfine, but it must take into consideration<br />\nthat it functions in a world of moral<br />\ncodes.\"<br />\nOkay, fine. But the fact remains that<br />\npeople do not turn in their friends to<br />\nthe Honor Commission. People who<br />\nget caught are those with few friends,<br />\nmany enemies, or a suspicious teacher. All too often, the man who pleads<br />\nguilty is not saying that he lives under<br />\nHonor and slipped from the rosy path<br />\ninto the thorns just this once. He lives<br />\nin the briar patch, and this time he was<br />\ncaught in it. As soon as you turn him<br />\nloose, that's where he's headed, only he<br />\nis going to be a hell of a lot more careful this time.<br /><br />\n(7) ROTC space can be utilized to<br />\ngreater advantage. In suggesting this,<br />\nI did not have in mind revival of defunct organizations such as the radio<br />\nclub to fill up wasted space at ROTC<br />\ninvitation. Rather, I intended to suggest that space in a university-owned<br />\nbuilding now be reallocated by the Administration for use by on-going student organizations such as SC, BSU,<br />\nGrad. Student Assoc., etc., and that<br />\nother space be remodeled into classrooms for assignment by the Registrar, not by ROTC. The \"Classroom<br />\nSpace Committee\" and the \"Committee on Student Affairs\" should enquire<br /><br />\nThis University doesn't live under the<br />\nHonor Code. Its students submit to the<br />\npower vested in the Commission, in<br />\ntacit acquiescence that the Commission<br />\nis bigger than they are.

As a youth Antonio watched the<br />\nMickey Mouse Club and fell in love with Annette. As he<br />\ngrew older Antonio's love obtained a degree of purity<br />\nand intensity worthy fo comparison to Dante's love for<br />\nBeatrice.<br />\nInspired by his love for Annette, Antonio turned to<br />\npoetry and showed great potential; indeed, it seemed to<br />\nmore than one observer that he was destined to replace<br />\nRod McKuen in the world of popular verse. But such,<br />\nalas, was not meant to be. One November eve he was<br />\ndriving back to his little hut up in the Sierra Nevada<br />\nMountains after having watched Beach Blanket Bingo on<br />\nhis mother's TV (for he never missed an Annette Funicello movie) when his car stalled as he was crossing a<br />\nrailroad track. A fast freight was coming downthe track;<br />\nAntonio's door was stuck and he was unable to escape<br />\nbefore the onrushing tide of fate swamped him. When<br />\nthe wrekage was cleared away, the poem which follows<br />\nwas found in an envelope addressed \"Annette Funicello,<br />\nc/o Walt Disney, Anaheim, California\" clutched in the<br />\nremains of his left hand.<br />\nIt is Antonio's last and greatest poem. Its deftly calculated rhythm, consumate choice of word and phrase,<br />\nand subtlety of allusion (mainly to the great romatics,<br />\nKeats, Shelley, Wordsworth, Coleridge and Jimi Hendrix)<br />\nqualify it as a masterpiece of its genre and perhaps as a<br />\nmasterpiece of 20th Century Literature. Therefore,without further academic commentary, I give you:<br />\nThe Four Seasons and Mary<br />\ndedicated to Annette<br />\nPrologue:<br />\nIt was eternal Summer and Autumn's breeze<br />\ncarressed your floating hair like<br /><br />\na delicately pointed snowflake alighting<br />\non a spring bubbling<br />\nfrom a virgin glade<br />\nin the freshmess of April.<br />\n--And the wind cries, Mary.<br />\nSpring:<br />\nWhen first I saw you, it was Spring and the birds<br />\nhad just begun, to sing.<br />\nYou were sitting amid some vernal boughs<br />\nPregnant, with life in delicate green buds.<br />\nYou saw me, and seeing<br />\ntook heart, and my hand:<br />\nI felt a deep thrill, as though, awakening within me<br />\nwere the very wellsprings of life.<br />\n--And the wind cries, Mary.<br />\nSummer:<br />\nThen Summer--an endless magic moment,<br />\nthe sun dancing on the sea foam,<br />\nthe sound of the waves mingling with your<br />\nbabbling voice-As though--I really don't know how to say this<br />\nfor words,obscure,and complicate<br />\nthe simplicity of true feeling-As though your life was one with the life of the sea<br />\nAnd your glittering eye fed off the sun-rays<br />\nand then, deep in the recesses of your soul,<br />\ngave back the light to the sun.<br />\n--And the wind cries, Mary.<br />\nFall:<br />\nSummer faded into Fall, the leaves<br />\nturned color and fell.<br />\nI saw in you a deep fullbodied richness, a mellowness<br />\nthat spoke of apple cider, pumpkin pie,<br />\nand, pure, maple syrup.<br />\nI came to know that there was more, to you, than<br />\nbright edged sun-rays of summerness;<br />\nand, alas, I saw that your autumnal fullness,<br />\nriding on the very crest of frost-tinged air,<br /><br />\nwas deeper, richer, than<br />\nthe summer gleam in my wan,<br />\nso very wan, eyes.<br />\n--And the wind cries, Mary.<br />\nWinter:<br />\nAnd so, the Autumn of my life eclipsed into Winter<br />\nand I felt, desolate, deserted-Oh why had love, and you, left me?<br />\nIn the forest a frozen pond reflected<br />\nmy inner coldness.<br />\nI looked<br />\ndeeper, and then,<br />\na gentle thrill melted my bones<br />\nFor beneath the ice I saw your blue eyes<br />\ntelling me that all,<br />\nAll was not lost.<br />\nFor love is deeper than a babbling brook in Spring<br />\nor a Summer of splendor in the grass;<br />\nLove lasts and lives to the naked<br />\nwinter trees etching their being into<br />\nwhite snow and<br />\ngrey winter skies.<br />\n--And the wind cries, Mary.<br />\nEpilogue:<br />\nNow, the winter wind speaks of truth<br />\nas a nightingale sings its high requiurn<br />\nof a midsummer's night to a blossoming cherry tree<br />\nin a Currier and Ives print hung above<br />\nan October fireplace.<br />\n--And the wind cires, Mary.<br />\nOn the last page of the manuscript the following note<br />\nwas scrawled, apparently written when he realized he<br />\ncouldn't escape from his car.<br />\n\"Dearest Annette, I have loved you always, I die only<br />\nto watch over you from<br /><br />\nCarl Jakob Joachim Benzor.<br /><br />\nMoog:Peabody's Electric Heart<br />\nUnceremoniously planted on a window-sill, d Moog synthesizer is the<br />\nheart of the Peabody Conservatory's<br />\nnew electronic music studio. The Moog,<br />\nand its brothers the Buchla and SynKet, is part of a second generation of<br />\nelectronic synthesizers in a field in<br />\nwhich many people never knew there<br />\nwas a first. But the window-sill-sized<br />\nMoog does almost all the same things<br />\nas the laboratory-sized Princeton (now<br />\nColumbia) RCA synthesizer of the sixties.<br />\nMrs. Jean Ivey, the director of the<br />\nPeabody's electronic music program,<br />\ndemonstrated what the Moog does. Each<br />\ninstrument is made to order and the<br />\nPeabody's has six oscillators which produce single tones and one \"white-sound\"<br />\nsource which produces an airy hiss.<br />\nThe sounds are modified with filters,<br />\na voltage control amplifier, and attenuators. A keyboard and a ribbon control, which is operated by sliding a<br />\nfinger along its length, can be used<br />\neither to switch from one pitch to another or to regulate dynamics.<br />\nHaving worked with a laboratory type<br />\nsynthesizer, Mrs. Ivey says she enjoys<br />\nthe compact size of the Moog because<br />\n\"it is designed with the composer in<br />\nmind.\" As a composer of both electronic and conventional music she finds<br />\nthe Moog more versatile than any live<br />\nperformer because it has greater dynamic and tonal range and can repro-<br /><br />\nduce more intricate rhythms. By combining the work of both composer and<br />\nperformer in one person, she said, the<br />\nMoog \"Makes the composer function<br />\nmore like a painter.\"<br /><br />\nComputer Drawbacks<br />\nA more recent development in the<br />\nfield of electronic music has been the<br />\nuse of computers to do the actual performing. Mrs. Ivey thinks this is a<br />\nthrowback to the days of the traditional<br />\ncomposer who could not hear what he<br />\nhad written until someone per ormed<br />\nit for him. She said there were other<br />\ndrawbacks to computer music. \"Learning how to converse with the computer<br />\nin such a way, that you can call for<br />\nwhat you'd like, finding out what to<br />\nexpect when you insert a certain program, is a big problem,\" she said.<br />\n\"There are a lot of interesting books<br />\nand articles about computer music but<br />\n....usually the description of the process<br />\nis a lot more interesting than the piece.\"<br />\nPart of the appeal of the computer<br />\nis that the entire piece can be performed without all the recording, re-recording, and splicing which accompanies synthesizer composing. It is not easy to<br />\ncompose music on the Moog and Mrs.<br />\nIvey said the age of \"instant music\"<br />\nhas not arrived.

Hopkins second win in as many<br />\nstarts was the first time a varsity basketball team has beaten Gettysburg in<br />\nseventeen long years. The last time<br />\nwas in the 1951-52 season. Present<br />\nAthletic Director Marshall Turner was<br />\nthe coach then.<br />\nDown 64-62 with 3:42 left to play,<br />\nHopkins roared back after a timeout<br />\nto tie the score at 64 all with 3:32<br />\nleft. Dribbling right handed, then left<br />\nhanded, then behind his back, Hopkins'<br />\nflashy sophomore guard, George Apple,<br />\nwho had been picked up at three-quarters court, drove to within the foul<br />\nlane and pumped up the tieing basket.<br />\nApple iced the game with another two<br />\npointer with 17 second left to play.<br />\nApple's basket made the score 7066.

Winning is becoming a habit. Last night's game,<br />\nthe measure of the ball club, was important. We were up by as much as<br />\n18. The team came out and played with<br />\nall their heart. I can't say enough for<br />\nthe team. They won the ball game,<br />\nnot me. To get overly sentimental, it<br />\ntook a lot of courage to comeback the<br />\nway they did after being down with 3<br />\nminutes left.\"<br />\nGettysburg is classed as a major<br />\ncollege since it plays such powerhouses as Penn State and Rutgers and was<br />\nregarded as an excellant shooting team.<br />\nHopkins jumped off to a quick start.<br /><br />\nScoring readily on Gary Handleman's<br />\nand George Apple's shots, the Blue<br />\nJays went into the locerk room with a<br />\ndefinite 44-30 advantage.<br />\nIn the second half, however, Gettysburg staged a comeback and in the end<br />\nof the game made up an 18 point deficit. With 3:45 left on the clock, the<br />\nJays fell behind for the first time in<br />\nthe game by 2 points.<br /><br />\nHandleman Leads Scorers<br />\nHandleman led th Blue Jays scorers<br />\nwith 21 points, hitting on 8 for 15 from<br />\nthe floor and 5 of 6 from the foul line.<br />\nTied with him for game honors was<br />\nRoger Eppehimer of Gettysburg, who<br />\nwas also the game's top rebounder with<br />\n13. Apple, scoring 16 points, and Thomas, 13, were also high scorers for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIn team statistics, Hopkins shot 39%<br />\nwhile Gettysburg made 35% of his field<br />\ngoal attempts. The story o the game<br /><br />\nTankmen Turn in Record Performances<br />\nThe JHU swimmers performed admirably well last weekend. In a scrimmage against a strong Elizabethtown<br />\nteam, a team composed of both varsity<br />\nand frosh members swam several good<br />\nswims and defeated the visitors. Saturday, the varsity virtually swamped Lycoming, 72 to 23 in their first official<br />\nmeet of the season, and the same day<br />\nthe freshman team defeated a tough<br />\nopponent in their scrimmage with the<br />\nCardinal O'Hara High School of Philadelphia with a score of 49 to 46.<br />\nIn the E-Town meet, Hopkins fielded<br />\ntwo squads, an A team and a B team,<br />\nboth composed of varsity and frosh,<br />\nin order to give everyone a chance<br />\nto swim some tough competition. Hopkins took five firsts to place the A<br />\nteam at the top of the meet. In the 200<br />\nyard freestyle race, freshman Michael<br />\nBoyd placed first, setting a new frosh<br />\nrecord of 1:57.5, with another freshman,<br />\nVince Nigrelli taking second with a time<br />\nof 1:58.4 also under the old freshman<br />\nrecord.<br />\nIn the 50 and 100 yard free events,<br /><br />\nvarsity captain, Rick Ware surprised<br />\neveryone by taking a first and second<br />\nplace, respectively, after having been<br />\nout of the water for six weeks with a<br />\nvirus. His return was a welcome addition to team strength.<br /><br />\nRecords Fall<br />\nFirst in the 11 free, was Vince Nigrelli<br />\nwith a time of 52.8. a second ahead of<br />\nWare. Michael Boyd went out in the 500<br />\nfree race and broke the frosh and varsity records he had set two weeks before<br />\nagainst Navy with a time of 5:21.8.<br />\nJunior Mare Solomon followed up with a<br />\nsecond place in that event.<br />\nAnother surprise for the weekend<br />\ncame in the diving when Ken Zonies<br />\ntook firsts against both E-Town and Lycoming.

Last month in Baltimore<br />\nfour Panthers were jailed on conspiracy charges and<br />\ntraffic violations.<br />\nPolice in Los Angeles said that there was no connection between their raid and the events in other cities.<br />\nTheir raid began about 330 a.m. Monday as the police<br />\nfirst cordoned off a 16 block area before moving in on<br />\nthe Panthers headquarters. According to a department<br />\nspokesman, the squad announced that they had warrants<br />\nto search the building. After receiving no answer, they<br />\nsaid they kicked down the door and were met by a volley<br />\nof bullets wounding 2 policemen.<br />\nThree hundred officers then spent the night exchanging<br />\nsporadic fire with the Panthers. They began lobbing tear<br />\ngas canisters into the building and in a space of an hour<br />\nflushed out 11 Panthers. The raid was conducted, according to the police, in search of illegal weapons and two<br />\nPanthers wanted on assault charges. Said one in the<br />\ncrowd, \"They aren't moving against the Black Panthers<br />\nalone, they're moving against the whole black nation.<br />\nAnyone who can't see this is a racist thing is crazy.\"<br /><br />\n...And Chicago<br />\nDozens of black community organizations, along with<br />\nsome predominately white civic groups, called this week<br />\nfor independent investigations of what happened when 15<br />\npolicemen assigned to the Illinois State's Attorney's<br />\noffice raided a West Side Chicago apartment at 440 a.m.<br />\nlast Thursday morning.<br />\nThe police have asserted that a woman opened fire on<br />\nthem with a shotgun, touching off a \"shoot-out\" lasting<br />\nat least 10 minutes. During the shootout, the 21-year-old<br />\nleader of the Illinois Black Panther party and another<br />\nPanther leader were shot to death. Charles Garry, the<br />\nwhite attorney for the black organization, maintained that<br />\na campaign of \"genocide\" is being carried out against<br />\nthe Panthers by the government.<br />\nThe Panthers charged that Fred Hampton, the chairman of the state's Panthers, had been \"murdered in his<br /><br />\nbed.\" They contended that the police had burst into the<br />\napartment and began shooting, and that no one else had<br />\na chance to shoot. The areas in the apartment where the<br />\npolice were last Thursday are clear of bullet holes. The<br />\nareas where the Panthers were are riddled.<br />\nAsked about the lack of bullet holes in the areas of the<br />\napartment where the official account said that the police<br />\nofficers had been under heavy fire, Edward Hanrahn,<br />\nCook County State's Attorney, replied, \"I don't believe<br />\nthe assumption that underlies that question is correct.<br />\nI don't think your observations were accurate, if that is<br />\nwhat you found.\" Asked why the police, who had equipped<br />\nthemselves with a submachinegun, had not brought tear<br />\ngas, he said, \"We took the precautions we believed were<br />\nappropriate for effecting that search warrant.\"<br />\nAsked why the raid was carried out at 4:40 a.m., he<br />\nstated, \"We believed that it was effected at an appropriate time.\" \"We have given our statement,\" he ended.<br /><br />\nthat stated that if groups or individuals continued to<br />\ndecide for themselves which laws were objectionable,<br />\n\"we shall face nationwide disobedience of many laws,<br />\nand thus, anarchy.\" They said that an individual or a<br />\nsmall group should test any law considered unconstitutional, and that all other dissenters should abide by the<br />\nlaw in question until it is invalidated by the courts.<br />\nThe six opponents of the majority, including Chairman<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower, hold that disobedience to civil<br />\nlaw, when there was a willing acceptance of the penaltY,<br />\nmight at times be the only means of disposing of unjust<br />\nlaws or policies of the government.<br />\n\"Willingness to incur the wrath and punishment of<br />\ngovernment,\" Mrs. Patrica Harris, professor of law at<br />\nHoward University, contended,\"can represent the highest<br />\nloyality and respect for a democratic society.Such respect<br />\nand self-sacrifice may well prevent, rather than cause,<br />\nviolence.\" Mrs. Harris and Judge Leon Higginbotham<br />\nwere the only two Negores on the violence commission.<br />\nBoth claimed that with the majority's prescription for<br />\ntesting unjust laws would never have won the civil rights<br />\nlegislation enacted in the 1960's under the impetus of<br />\ncivil disobedience.<br />\nThe commission was unanimous, however, in finding<br />\nthat among the mass demonstrators of today are \"some<br />\nof the most destructive elements in American society.\"<br />\n\"Only naive and willful blindness can obscure the strength<br />\nof these dark forces, which, but for the loosening of the<br />\nbonds of the law, might otherwise lie quiescent beneath<br />\nthe surface of our national life.\"<br /><br />\nCoed Quiverings<br />\nThe Task Force on Coeducation issued a recommendation this week that the question of allowing girls' admission to the freshman class next year be reconsidered.<br />\nPreviously, President Gordon suggested, and the Board<br />\nof Trustees approved, that only sophomore and junior<br />\ntransfer women be admitted to Hopkins in September.<br />\nThe Admissions Office has yet to begin active recruitment of female transfer students. About 150 girls<br />\nIn the last month have sent in written requests for information pertaining to admission. The Office said it will<br />\nnot begin recruitment until the decision of whether or<br />\nnot to allow in freshmen women is made.<br />\nThere are currently four plans to house the women.<br />\nOne is to have them live off-campus, and is considered<br />\nundesireable. Another plan is to redo either two freshmen or upper class dorms to facilitate the women.<br />\nChanging two freshmen dorms would cost about $40,000,<br />\nthe upper class dorns would be substantially more.
