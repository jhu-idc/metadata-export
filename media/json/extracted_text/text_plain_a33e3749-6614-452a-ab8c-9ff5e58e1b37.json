It will<br />\nundoubtedly do what any<br />\nworthwhile work of art, in my<br />\nopinion, should do: It will offend<br />\nsome of you, delight some of<br />\nyou, confuse a lot of you, and in<br />\ndoing a little of each to almost<br />\nall, cause you to pause and<br />\nreflect on whatever it was, that<br />\njust bombarded you.<br />\nWhy I love Robert Altman...<br />\nRobert Altman is not an easy<br />\nfilmmaker, and likewise<br />\nNashvillet, which without a doubt<br />\nmarks the culmination of his<br />\nnot-so-lengthy career, is not an<br />\neasy film; you'll be lucky to<br />\ncatch anything resembling a plot.<br />\nAltman is trying to achieve<br />\nso:inething unique in<br />\ncontemporary cinema; he's trying<br />\nto tell a story, yet more<br />\nspecifically relate an emotion, by<br />\ndiscarding the standard literary<br />\ndevices so that the audience is hit<br />\nwith a series of carefully<br />\nconstructed and even more<br />\ncarefully juxtaposed<br />\nimages-Altman has commented<br />\nthat the film is more edited than<br />\ndirected -which are played<br />\nagainst a soundtrack of<br />\noverlapping dialogue. The<br />\nrelationship of one scene to<br />\nanother often seems unclear; the<br />\nviewer must think hard to find a<br />\ncontinuity. The dialogue is only<br />\npartially comprehensible; the<br />\nlistener must strain to find a<br />\nsemblance of communication. It<br />\ndoesn't make any sense, but you<br />\ntry to make sense out of it<br />\nanyway. In short, it's real life.<br />\nWhat you've heard from your<br />\nfriends and \"The Nashville<br />\nHype\"<br />\nParamount thinks that<br />\nNashville bombed because, even<br />\nthough it cost approximately two<br />\nmillion, it only grossed about<br />\neight million. It was not another<br />\n111*A *S*H, Altman's only other<br />\nfinancial success, and there was<br />\nno shark with which the studio<br />\ncould brandish the American<br />\npublic in order to frighten it into<br />\nthe theatres. Ironically, rave<br />\nreviews and an inappropriate<br />\nadvertising campaign were<br />\nprobably just what kept the film<br />\nfrom \"taking off into the<br />\nstratosphere\" as Pauline Kael<br />\nbelieved it would. Kael was the<br />\nfirst of the critics to burden the<br />\nfilm with unrestrained laud.<br />\nReviewing it from a rough cut<br />\nweeks before it opened. Kael<br />\nreadied the public for a<br />\nconglomerate of Gone with the<br />\nWind, 77ie Sound of Music, and<br />\nBirth of a Nation. Many of her<br />\ncolleagues rapidly began<br />\nsearching their thesaureses for<br />\nadjectives that would convince us<br />\nthat they were the first to<br />\ndiscover this \"funniest epic<br />\nvision of America ever.- These<br />\npreliminary raves- probably hurt<br />\n<br />\nthe film more than the worst<br />\nnotices could have, in that Joe<br />\nMoviegoer was ready for<br />\nsomething that a film as difficult<br />\nand different as Nashville could<br />\nnever fulfill, something that<br />\nwould allow him to escape into a<br />\ndarkened movie theatre for two<br />\nhours and forty-nine minutes and<br />\nlive) out his fantasies of the<br />\nperfect movie. Nashville was<br />\nnever a film that should have<br />\nbeen thrust upon us;but in all of<br />\nits unpretentiousness, we should<br />\nhave been allowed to discover it<br />\nfor ourselves. Although the<br />\nmajority of notices were<br />\nstrikingly positive, particular<br />\ncritics began to speak of \"The<br />\nNashville Hype.\" They believed<br />\nthat the film was an<br />\n<br />\nunimpressed. As for those who<br />\nwere impressed, I can only say<br />\nthat after repeated viewings I am<br />\nwholeheartedly of their opinion.<br />\nRegarding the others, I can<br />\nunderstand how one's great<br />\nexpectations would be easily<br />\nsoured by such an unexpected<br />\nmovie. The country music lovers<br />\nhad probably already decided to<br />\ndislike the film before they<br />\nviewed it. For them, my only<br />\nresponse is that I find it highly<br />\nunlikely that so many people<br />\nwould expend so much of their<br />\ntalent, time, and money by<br />\nmaking a movie whose sole intent<br />\nwas to mock country music.<br />\nWhat Nashville is really about<br />\nand how you should view it.<br />\nThe thing is...The thing that<br />\n<br />\ntextured fabric, \"just remember<br />\nto add yourself as the<br />\ntwenty-fifth character.\"<br />\nThe movie and its memorable<br />\nmoments, and what it will<br />\nprobably be like remembering it<br />\nas the century turns.<br />\nTo my mind, there has never<br />\nbeen a film more American than<br />\nNashville. It is, however, not<br />\nreally correct to consider the city<br />\nof Nashville as an allegory for<br />\nAmerica. Perhaps an apter title<br />\nwould have been Nashvillians<br />\nbecause the power of the film lies<br />\nnot in how America acts but how<br />\nAmericans act, and how you, as<br />\nan American (and the<br />\ntwenty-fifth character), react to<br />\nthe characters and, by doing so,<br />\nreact to the film. The film tells us<br />\n<br />\nAllen Garfield comforts Ronee Blakely after the first box office returns were in<br />\n<br />\nincomprehensible trifle depicting<br />\nsuperficial people in soap opera<br />\nrelationships, and that if any<br />\nsense could be made out of the<br />\nfilm it was that it was made as-a<br />\nbad joke against country music.<br />\nFurthermore, those so-called<br />\nsophisticated New York critics,<br />\nwith their overblown reviews,<br />\nwere only perpetuating the joke.<br />\nThe promotion people only<br />\nworsened matters by trying<br />\ndesparately to sell the movie to<br />\nthe already-offended country<br />\nmusic crowd. Many of my<br />\n- to my primary<br />\nfriends ,<br />\nincomprehension, \u2022 acted very<br />\nnegatively toward the film. In<br />\ndiscussing the film with others. I<br />\ndiscovered many positive<br />\nfeelings. In fact. I can almost<br />\ndivide reactions of these people<br />\ninto two categories: greatly<br />\nimpressed and greatly<br />\n<br />\nmakes Nashville so difficult to<br />\ntake is that...Nashville is about<br />\nwhatever you believe it to be<br />\nabout. That, more than anything<br />\nelse, I believe was the sole intent<br />\nof Nashville. We always look for<br />\nthe artist's underlying meaning.<br />\nalways are quick to jot down<br />\nwhat the professor says, and are<br />\nalways reluctant to ask ourselves<br />\nwhat it (the art) meant to us. In<br />\nhis Playboy interview, Altman<br />\nstated that the one thing he<br />\nabsolutely refuses to do is do the<br />\nfilmgoer's thinking for him. So in<br />\nthis aspect, Nashville is an<br />\nunresolved mystery with only<br />\nyou and your wits to resolve it.<br />\nMore than anything, I urge you<br />\nto go to Nashville with an open<br />\nmind and, to quote Joan<br />\nTewksbury, the scenarist who<br />\nwove (more than wrote) the<br />\nscreen play into such a richly<br />\n<br />\nmore about what we do than<br />\nwhat we are or about what<br />\nloyalities we hold; its impact lies<br />\nin its action.<br />\nThe superficial action deals<br />\nwith these two dozen motley<br />\ncharacters who end up in<br />\nNashville with their own<br />\naspirations and delusions,<br />\ninteract with one another over a<br />\nperiod of several days, and end<br />\nup at a campaign rally for Hal<br />\nPhilips Walker at Nashville's<br />\nproudest monument, a plastic<br />\nreplica of the Parthenon. Walker,<br />\na Replacement Party candidate<br />\nfor president, is heard through<br />\nthe auspices of mass media<br />\nthroughout the film. He is a<br />\ngenial, yet slick southerner<br />\nwhose voice booms from his<br />\ncampaign truck promising \"New<br />\nRoots- for America.\" Sound<br />\nvaguely like anyone we've electe \u2022<br />\n<br />\nPresident of the United States in<br />\nthe last few weeks?<br />\nThe following are a few of the<br />\ncharacters you'll meet and about<br />\nwhom you'll probably end up<br />\nexclaiming, \"My God, I know<br />\nthese people!\":<br />\nBarbara Jean, tenderly played<br />\nby Ronnee Blakely, is the queen<br />\nof country music who is unable<br />\nto disassociate her public image<br />\nfrom her private self. In the scene<br />\nwhich won Blakely an AcademY<br />\nAward nomination, Barbara Jean<br />\nhas a nervous breakdown before<br />\nher not-so-loving fans. Before<br />\nbleachers full of Middle<br />\nAmerican faces, her hand reaches<br />\nfor something yet finds onlY<br />\nempty space.

I urge you<br />\nnot to miss the opening in which<br />\nthe film realizes itself as part of<br />\nthe McLuhanesque media that so<br />\nsavagely affects us all, to listen to<br />\nthe lyrics (even if you detest<br />\ncountry music) because they just<br />\nmight be saying more than theY<br />\nappear to be saying, to .notice'<br />\nhow Altman manipulates<br />\n\"automobiles\" and \"flowers\",<br />\nand to sit back and allow his<br />\nvoyeuristic, telephoto lens \"to<br />\nmake you see to see\" (to<br />\nparaphrase D.W.

I do<br />\nnot pretend to have firsthand<br />\nknowledge of the incident,andso<br />\ncannot contest the facts as<br />\npresented except to mite that, in<br />\nhowever offhand a fashion, the<br />\nNews-Letter admitted that \u2022 its<br />\naccount of the incident was<br />\ndrawn from the point of view of<br />\nthe accused.<br />\nYet, I would like to address<br />\nthe topic of violence: not the<br />\nimputed violence of alleged<br />\npolice actions, but the more<br />\nsubtle and pernicious violence of<br />\nthe printed word. You cavalierly<br />\nassociate community<br />\ninvolvement with support of du<br />\naccused. What of the Baltimor(<br />\nPolice? Are they banished forn<br />\nthe community because they<br />\nseek to preserve it? At the least.<br />\nare they not entitled to a<br />\nsuspension of judgement pending<br />\nadjudication of the matter--a<br />\nsuspension of judgement granted<br />\nby their spokesman Mr. Hill to<br />\nthe defendants? And what of the<br />\nHopkins Student Council. in<br />\n<br />\ntheir public support for the<br />\ndefendants? Are they not<br />\nusurping the right of each of us<br />\nto decide for ourselves on the<br />\nmatter, by using the name of this<br />\nuniversity in support of the<br />\ndefendants?<br />\nYour editorial ends with the<br />\nominous warning that there are<br />\ntoo many incidents these days.<br />\nAnd so there are. Yet, an astute<br />\nobserver must realize that the<br />\nindividuals who ,often, garner<br />\nsupport by claiming to speak for<br />\nthe community are in fact<br />\nforeign to it. Those who propose<br />\nto speak for American workers<br />\nare in fact Syndicalists, who<br />\nwould use their right of free<br />\nspeech to make us all unFree.<br />\nThere are incidents now. If<br />\nthose attempting to destroy the<br />\nAmerican system have their way<br />\nwith us, there will be no more<br />\nincidents, no more court tests of<br />\nfree speech, no more police<br />\nbrutality. There will be no<br />\ncourts, no speech, and nothing<br />\nwill be adjudged brutal. There<br />\nmay be a community: it will not<br />\nembrace us but that it will<br />\nstrangle us.<br />\nPeter Koenig<br />\n<br />\nCan an education be justified?<br />\nBy MARK'.IIERTSGAARD<br />\nWhat is the purpose of an<br />\nundergraduate education?<br />\nOften, people's answers to this<br />\nquestion can be separated into<br />\ntwo general cateogires. One<br />\nviewpoint is that an education<br />\nshould prepare people<br />\n(personally, culturally,<br />\nintellectually) for \"the<br />\nmagnificent possibilities of life.\"<br />\nHigh on the priorities list of such<br />\nan education are the attainment<br />\nof such virtues as a love of<br />\nlearning for its own sake, the<br />\nfostering of attitudes (discipline,<br />\nintellectual curiosity and<br />\ntolerance, and objectivity) and<br />\nthe development of a critical<br />\nperspective of the world and<br />\none's relation to it. A recipient of<br />\nsuch an education is generally<br />\nexpected to be somewhat<br />\nacquainted with a broad range of<br />\nknowledge, including smatterings<br />\nof literature and politics of<br />\nancient hisotry along with an<br />\nacquaintance with science, math<br />\nand foreign languages. In the<br />\ncontext of undergraduate<br />\nlearning, a student who has pursued this liberal arts<br />\neducation is believed tobe better<br />\nprepared not only for life in<br />\ngeneral, but also for a more<br />\nintelligent selection of a future<br />\noccupation.<br />\nAlthough there are problems<br />\nwith this approach to learning, it<br />\nis a vision that appeals to many,<br />\nif not most, members of an<br />\nacademic environment such as<br />\nJohns Hopkins. If only we could<br />\nput it into practice! But as all<br />\ngood, career-oriented people<br />\nknow, the overwhelming<br />\nmajority of those studnets who<br />\ndo try this path of enlightenment<br />\nusually get only as far as the<br />\nunemployment office after<br />\ngraduation. Consequently, there<br />\nare increasing numbers who<br />\nbelieve that an undergraduate<br />\neducation should, first and<br />\nforemost, be the ticket to a<br />\ndecent job. While at first glance it<br />\nis possible to criticize these<br />\npeople as throaty, materialist<br />\nautomatons who would sell their<br />\nloved ones for admission to<br />\n<br />\npo,fr,t<br />\n<br />\nmedical school, such an attack is<br />\nunfair and superficial and shows<br />\nan unfortunate misunderstanding<br />\nof the complexity of the<br />\nproblem.<br />\nBefore lambasting the<br />\npre-professional education ethic,<br />\none must make some attempt to<br />\nunderstand why it has become so<br />\nprevalent. One important factor<br />\nhas been the belief that getting<br />\nan education, especially a college<br />\none, offers the best hope of<br />\nclimbing the socio-economic<br />\nladder. You remember the ads<br />\nfrom a few years ago--\"to get a<br />\ngood job, get a good education \"<br />\nUntil recently, the promise of a<br />\ngood job following a good<br />\neducation was usually fulfilled in<br />\nAmerica. Everything seemed to<br />\nbe running smoothly, if we can<br />\nset aside the fact that many<br />\nAmericans, especailly the poor<br />\nand minorities, did and still do<br />\nnot enjoy access to a good<br />\neducation.<br />\nBut in the 1970's, as things<br />\ntighten up economically,jobs are<br />\nbecoming harder and harder to<br />\nfind after graduation. These<br />\neconomic and employment<br />\nworries have been responsible, to<br />\na large extent, for the change in<br />\ntone seen on many campuses in<br />\nrecent years. Examples of this<br />\nchange abound. Increased<br />\ncompetition for jobs and<br />\nacceptances to graduate and<br />\nprofessional schools has naturally<br />\nled to increased competition for<br />\ngrades among undergraduates.<br />\nThe ramifications of increased<br />\ncompetition include spiraling<br />\ngrade inflation, more and more<br />\ncases of cheating, greater<br />\nspecialization in course selection,<br />\nand a general turning inward by<br />\nstudents.<br />\nWhile all of the afflictions<br />\nmentioned above are certainly<br />\nimportant, the most disturbing<br />\neffect of the \"back to the<br />\nbooks--go for tile job'<br />\nconsciousness is the malaise of<br />\ncomplacency that pervades<br />\nundergraduate education. We<br />\ndon't care anymore. Students<br />\ndon't get involved in<br />\nnon-academic affairs because<br />\n<br />\n.\"..\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Ill<br />\n<br />\nCL<br />\nMOW<br />\n\u20227(r.<br />\n<br />\nThe Gordian Knot<br />\n<br />\nthey are too busy studying to get<br />\ninto graduate school. There is<br />\nlittle questioning of what is read<br />\nor heard in lectures. It is just so<br />\nmuch easier (and safer) merely to<br />\ndigest the material and spew it<br />\nback out in the papers and<br />\nexams.<br />\nPerhaps most regrettable, few<br />\n\u2022students truly come to grips with<br />\nthe meaning of their educations.<br />\nThis is by no means entirely the<br />\nfault of studnets. Colleges could<br />\nand should do a better job of<br />\nhelping students with this matter.<br />\n-Students do question, but<br />\nusually only to a certain point.<br />\nFor example, many of us<br />\ncomplain about the competition,<br />\nthe pressure, and the<br />\nmeaninglessness of learning by<br />\nrote what we will soon forget. We<br />\ntalk about changing majors, or<br />\neven schools, or of taking a\u2022year<br />\noff. But we usually fail to<br />\nconfront the primary issue: what<br />\nis the purpose of an education?<br />\nWhat can and should we expect<br />\nto gain from our undergraduate<br />\nyears? More specifically, can<br />\nthose goals be achieved at Johns<br />\nHopkins? Can they be achieved<br />\nat Johns Hopkins? Call they be<br />\n. achieved without a university<br />\neducation? In what respects can a<br />\ncollege education be justified for<br />\nits own sake?<br />\nForums<br />\nThese are difficult questions.<br />\nBut if students are to begin to<br />\nunderstand their role within the<br />\nuniversity and society and the<br />\nrelation of their educations to<br />\ntheir lives and future plans, these<br />\nand other questions must be<br />\nasked. In an effort to facilitate<br />\nsuch discussion, the Student<br />\nCouncil is sponsoring -a series of<br />\nforums entitled \"The Goals of an<br />\n. undergraduate education.\" The<br />\nfirst presentation will take place<br />\nthis Monday night, November<br />\n1 5 , at 7 p.m. ill the<br />\nListening-Viewing Room of the<br />\nStudent Union.

This one was<br />\na reflection on his childhood in<br />\nHamstead Heath (the abodes of<br />\nShakespeare and D.H. Lawrence),<br />\nwhere he met the uneasy feeling<br />\nof British soldiers touring<br />\neverywhere, looking for women,<br />\n\"Their skirts tight around the<br />\nass.\" The poem is typical in its<br />\ncombination of mythological,<br />\nidyllic, and modern subject<br />\nmatter.<br />\n1Parallet<br />\nThese kind of poems derive<br />\ntheir success by making<br />\ncontemporary conclusions about<br />\ncontemporary matters, with<br />\nparallel images of the past. This<br />\nseems to be Gunn's theme and<br />\ngift.<br />\nGunn says he tries to<br />\nemphasize personal experience<br />\neven when including classical<br />\nimagery. At the same time,<br />\nhowever, he doesn't want to<br />\nlapse into confessionalism, he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nWhile being detached, Gunn<br />\nattempts to \"live experience<br />\nthrough its detail.\"<br />\nAnother poem, \"Three,\"<br />\nexemplifies his use of dramatic<br />\n<br />\ndetail.

It will<br />\nundoubtedly do what any<br />\nworthwhile work of art, in my<br />\nopinion, should do: It will offend<br />\nsome of you, delight some of<br />\nyou, confuse a lot of you, and in<br />\ndoing a little of each to almost<br />\nall, cause you to pause and<br />\nreflect on whatever it was, that<br />\njust bombarded you.<br />\nWhy I love Robert Altman...<br />\nRobert Altman is not an easy<br />\nfilmmaker, and likewise<br />\nNashvillet, which without a doubt<br />\nmarks the culmination of his<br />\nnot-so-lengthy career, is not an<br />\neasy film; you'll be lucky to<br />\ncatch anything resembling a plot.<br />\nAltman is trying to achieve<br />\nso:inething unique in<br />\ncontemporary cinema; he's trying<br />\nto tell a story, yet more<br />\nspecifically relate an emotion, by<br />\ndiscarding the standard literary<br />\ndevices so that the audience is hit<br />\nwith a series of carefully<br />\nconstructed and even more<br />\ncarefully juxtaposed<br />\nimages-Altman has commented<br />\nthat the film is more edited than<br />\ndirected -which are played<br />\nagainst a soundtrack of<br />\noverlapping dialogue. The<br />\nrelationship of one scene to<br />\nanother often seems unclear; the<br />\nviewer must think hard to find a<br />\ncontinuity. The dialogue is only<br />\npartially comprehensible; the<br />\nlistener must strain to find a<br />\nsemblance of communication. It<br />\ndoesn't make any sense, but you<br />\ntry to make sense out of it<br />\nanyway. In short, it's real life.<br />\nWhat you've heard from your<br />\nfriends and \"The Nashville<br />\nHype\"<br />\nParamount thinks that<br />\nNashville bombed because, even<br />\nthough it cost approximately two<br />\nmillion, it only grossed about<br />\neight million. It was not another<br />\n111*A *S*H, Altman's only other<br />\nfinancial success, and there was<br />\nno shark with which the studio<br />\ncould brandish the American<br />\npublic in order to frighten it into<br />\nthe theatres. Ironically, rave<br />\nreviews and an inappropriate<br />\nadvertising campaign were<br />\nprobably just what kept the film<br />\nfrom \"taking off into the<br />\nstratosphere\" as Pauline Kael<br />\nbelieved it would. Kael was the<br />\nfirst of the critics to burden the<br />\nfilm with unrestrained laud.<br />\nReviewing it from a rough cut<br />\nweeks before it opened. Kael<br />\nreadied the public for a<br />\nconglomerate of Gone with the<br />\nWind, 77ie Sound of Music, and<br />\nBirth of a Nation. Many of her<br />\ncolleagues rapidly began<br />\nsearching their thesaureses for<br />\nadjectives that would convince us<br />\nthat they were the first to<br />\ndiscover this \"funniest epic<br />\nvision of America ever.- These<br />\npreliminary raves- probably hurt<br /><br />\nthe film more than the worst<br />\nnotices could have, in that Joe<br />\nMoviegoer was ready for<br />\nsomething that a film as difficult<br />\nand different as Nashville could<br />\nnever fulfill, something that<br />\nwould allow him to escape into a<br />\ndarkened movie theatre for two<br />\nhours and forty-nine minutes and<br />\nlive) out his fantasies of the<br />\nperfect movie. Nashville was<br />\nnever a film that should have<br />\nbeen thrust upon us;but in all of<br />\nits unpretentiousness, we should<br />\nhave been allowed to discover it<br />\nfor ourselves. Although the<br />\nmajority of notices were<br />\nstrikingly positive, particular<br />\ncritics began to speak of \"The<br />\nNashville Hype.\" They believed<br />\nthat the film was an<br /><br />\nunimpressed. As for those who<br />\nwere impressed, I can only say<br />\nthat after repeated viewings I am<br />\nwholeheartedly of their opinion.<br />\nRegarding the others, I can<br />\nunderstand how one's great<br />\nexpectations would be easily<br />\nsoured by such an unexpected<br />\nmovie. The country music lovers<br />\nhad probably already decided to<br />\ndislike the film before they<br />\nviewed it. For them, my only<br />\nresponse is that I find it highly<br />\nunlikely that so many people<br />\nwould expend so much of their<br />\ntalent, time, and money by<br />\nmaking a movie whose sole intent<br />\nwas to mock country music.<br />\nWhat Nashville is really about<br />\nand how you should view it.<br />\nThe thing is...The thing that<br /><br />\ntextured fabric, \"just remember<br />\nto add yourself as the<br />\ntwenty-fifth character.\"<br />\nThe movie and its memorable<br />\nmoments, and what it will<br />\nprobably be like remembering it<br />\nas the century turns.<br />\nTo my mind, there has never<br />\nbeen a film more American than<br />\nNashville. It is, however, not<br />\nreally correct to consider the city<br />\nof Nashville as an allegory for<br />\nAmerica. Perhaps an apter title<br />\nwould have been Nashvillians<br />\nbecause the power of the film lies<br />\nnot in how America acts but how<br />\nAmericans act, and how you, as<br />\nan American (and the<br />\ntwenty-fifth character), react to<br />\nthe characters and, by doing so,<br />\nreact to the film. The film tells us<br /><br />\nAllen Garfield comforts Ronee Blakely after the first box office returns were in<br /><br />\nincomprehensible trifle depicting<br />\nsuperficial people in soap opera<br />\nrelationships, and that if any<br />\nsense could be made out of the<br />\nfilm it was that it was made as-a<br />\nbad joke against country music.<br />\nFurthermore, those so-called<br />\nsophisticated New York critics,<br />\nwith their overblown reviews,<br />\nwere only perpetuating the joke.<br />\nThe promotion people only<br />\nworsened matters by trying<br />\ndesparately to sell the movie to<br />\nthe already-offended country<br />\nmusic crowd. Many of my<br />\n- to my primary<br />\nfriends ,<br />\nincomprehension, \u2022 acted very<br />\nnegatively toward the film. In<br />\ndiscussing the film with others. I<br />\ndiscovered many positive<br />\nfeelings. In fact. I can almost<br />\ndivide reactions of these people<br />\ninto two categories: greatly<br />\nimpressed and greatly<br /><br />\nmakes Nashville so difficult to<br />\ntake is that...Nashville is about<br />\nwhatever you believe it to be<br />\nabout. That, more than anything<br />\nelse, I believe was the sole intent<br />\nof Nashville. We always look for<br />\nthe artist's underlying meaning.<br />\nalways are quick to jot down<br />\nwhat the professor says, and are<br />\nalways reluctant to ask ourselves<br />\nwhat it (the art) meant to us. In<br />\nhis Playboy interview, Altman<br />\nstated that the one thing he<br />\nabsolutely refuses to do is do the<br />\nfilmgoer's thinking for him.

Up in<br />\nWest Point, cadets have decided to take more responsibility<br />\nfor their class conduct, mainly by eliminating office review<br />\nboards.<br />\nAT Hopkins, that line you used to sign on the back of blue<br />\nbooks would only bring a date with the local boys on the<br />\nHonor Commission.

I do<br />\nnot pretend to have firsthand<br />\nknowledge of the incident,andso<br />\ncannot contest the facts as<br />\npresented except to mite that, in<br />\nhowever offhand a fashion, the<br />\nNews-Letter admitted that \u2022 its<br />\naccount of the incident was<br />\ndrawn from the point of view of<br />\nthe accused.<br />\nYet, I would like to address<br />\nthe topic of violence: not the<br />\nimputed violence of alleged<br />\npolice actions, but the more<br />\nsubtle and pernicious violence of<br />\nthe printed word. You cavalierly<br />\nassociate community<br />\ninvolvement with support of du<br />\naccused. What of the Baltimor(<br />\nPolice? Are they banished forn<br />\nthe community because they<br />\nseek to preserve it? At the least.<br />\nare they not entitled to a<br />\nsuspension of judgement pending<br />\nadjudication of the matter--a<br />\nsuspension of judgement granted<br />\nby their spokesman Mr. Hill to<br />\nthe defendants? And what of the<br />\nHopkins Student Council. in<br /><br />\ntheir public support for the<br />\ndefendants? Are they not<br />\nusurping the right of each of us<br />\nto decide for ourselves on the<br />\nmatter, by using the name of this<br />\nuniversity in support of the<br />\ndefendants?<br />\nYour editorial ends with the<br />\nominous warning that there are<br />\ntoo many incidents these days.<br />\nAnd so there are. Yet, an astute<br />\nobserver must realize that the<br />\nindividuals who ,often, garner<br />\nsupport by claiming to speak for<br />\nthe community are in fact<br />\nforeign to it. Those who propose<br />\nto speak for American workers<br />\nare in fact Syndicalists, who<br />\nwould use their right of free<br />\nspeech to make us all unFree.<br />\nThere are incidents now. If<br />\nthose attempting to destroy the<br />\nAmerican system have their way<br />\nwith us, there will be no more<br />\nincidents, no more court tests of<br />\nfree speech, no more police<br />\nbrutality. There will be no<br />\ncourts, no speech, and nothing<br />\nwill be adjudged brutal. There<br />\nmay be a community: it will not<br />\nembrace us but that it will<br />\nstrangle us.<br />\nPeter Koenig<br /><br />\nCan an education be justified?<br />\nBy MARK'.IIERTSGAARD<br />\nWhat is the purpose of an<br />\nundergraduate education?<br />\nOften, people's answers to this<br />\nquestion can be separated into<br />\ntwo general cateogires. One<br />\nviewpoint is that an education<br />\nshould prepare people<br />\n(personally, culturally,<br />\nintellectually) for \"the<br />\nmagnificent possibilities of life.\"<br />\nHigh on the priorities list of such<br />\nan education are the attainment<br />\nof such virtues as a love of<br />\nlearning for its own sake, the<br />\nfostering of attitudes (discipline,<br />\nintellectual curiosity and<br />\ntolerance, and objectivity) and<br />\nthe development of a critical<br />\nperspective of the world and<br />\none's relation to it. A recipient of<br />\nsuch an education is generally<br />\nexpected to be somewhat<br />\nacquainted with a broad range of<br />\nknowledge, including smatterings<br />\nof literature and politics of<br />\nancient hisotry along with an<br />\nacquaintance with science, math<br />\nand foreign languages. In the<br />\ncontext of undergraduate<br />\nlearning, a student who has pursued this liberal arts<br />\neducation is believed tobe better<br />\nprepared not only for life in<br />\ngeneral, but also for a more<br />\nintelligent selection of a future<br />\noccupation.<br />\nAlthough there are problems<br />\nwith this approach to learning, it<br />\nis a vision that appeals to many,<br />\nif not most, members of an<br />\nacademic environment such as<br />\nJohns Hopkins. If only we could<br />\nput it into practice! But as all<br />\ngood, career-oriented people<br />\nknow, the overwhelming<br />\nmajority of those studnets who<br />\ndo try this path of enlightenment<br />\nusually get only as far as the<br />\nunemployment office after<br />\ngraduation. Consequently, there<br />\nare increasing numbers who<br />\nbelieve that an undergraduate<br />\neducation should, first and<br />\nforemost, be the ticket to a<br />\ndecent job. While at first glance it<br />\nis possible to criticize these<br />\npeople as throaty, materialist<br />\nautomatons who would sell their<br />\nloved ones for admission to<br /><br />\npo,fr,t<br /><br />\nmedical school, such an attack is<br />\nunfair and superficial and shows<br />\nan unfortunate misunderstanding<br />\nof the complexity of the<br />\nproblem.<br />\nBefore lambasting the<br />\npre-professional education ethic,<br />\none must make some attempt to<br />\nunderstand why it has become so<br />\nprevalent. One important factor<br />\nhas been the belief that getting<br />\nan education, especially a college<br />\none, offers the best hope of<br />\nclimbing the socio-economic<br />\nladder. You remember the ads<br />\nfrom a few years ago--\"to get a<br />\ngood job, get a good education \"<br />\nUntil recently, the promise of a<br />\ngood job following a good<br />\neducation was usually fulfilled in<br />\nAmerica. Everything seemed to<br />\nbe running smoothly, if we can<br />\nset aside the fact that many<br />\nAmericans, especailly the poor<br />\nand minorities, did and still do<br />\nnot enjoy access to a good<br />\neducation.<br />\nBut in the 1970's, as things<br />\ntighten up economically,jobs are<br />\nbecoming harder and harder to<br />\nfind after graduation. These<br />\neconomic and employment<br />\nworries have been responsible, to<br />\na large extent, for the change in<br />\ntone seen on many campuses in<br />\nrecent years. Examples of this<br />\nchange abound. Increased<br />\ncompetition for jobs and<br />\nacceptances to graduate and<br />\nprofessional schools has naturally<br />\nled to increased competition for<br />\ngrades among undergraduates.<br />\nThe ramifications of increased<br />\ncompetition include spiraling<br />\ngrade inflation, more and more<br />\ncases of cheating, greater<br />\nspecialization in course selection,<br />\nand a general turning inward by<br />\nstudents.<br />\nWhile all of the afflictions<br />\nmentioned above are certainly<br />\nimportant, the most disturbing<br />\neffect of the \"back to the<br />\nbooks--go for tile job'<br />\nconsciousness is the malaise of<br />\ncomplacency that pervades<br />\nundergraduate education. We<br />\ndon't care anymore. Students<br />\ndon't get involved in<br />\nnon-academic affairs because<br /><br />\n.\"..\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022Ill<br /><br />\nCL<br />\nMOW<br />\n\u20227(r.<br /><br />\nThe Gordian Knot<br /><br />\nthey are too busy studying to get<br />\ninto graduate school. There is<br />\nlittle questioning of what is read<br />\nor heard in lectures. It is just so<br />\nmuch easier (and safer) merely to<br />\ndigest the material and spew it<br />\nback out in the papers and<br />\nexams.<br />\nPerhaps most regrettable, few<br />\n\u2022students truly come to grips with<br />\nthe meaning of their educations.<br />\nThis is by no means entirely the<br />\nfault of studnets. Colleges could<br />\nand should do a better job of<br />\nhelping students with this matter.<br />\n-Students do question, but<br />\nusually only to a certain point.<br />\nFor example, many of us<br />\ncomplain about the competition,<br />\nthe pressure, and the<br />\nmeaninglessness of learning by<br />\nrote what we will soon forget. We<br />\ntalk about changing majors, or<br />\neven schools, or of taking a\u2022year<br />\noff. But we usually fail to<br />\nconfront the primary issue: what<br />\nis the purpose of an education?<br />\nWhat can and should we expect<br />\nto gain from our undergraduate<br />\nyears? More specifically, can<br />\nthose goals be achieved at Johns<br />\nHopkins? Can they be achieved<br />\nat Johns Hopkins? Call they be<br />\n. achieved without a university<br />\neducation? In what respects can a<br />\ncollege education be justified for<br />\nits own sake?<br />\nForums<br />\nThese are difficult questions.<br />\nBut if students are to begin to<br />\nunderstand their role within the<br />\nuniversity and society and the<br />\nrelation of their educations to<br />\ntheir lives and future plans, these<br />\nand other questions must be<br />\nasked. In an effort to facilitate<br />\nsuch discussion, the Student<br />\nCouncil is sponsoring -a series of<br />\nforums entitled \"The Goals of an<br />\n. undergraduate education.\" The<br />\nfirst presentation will take place<br />\nthis Monday night, November<br />\n1 5 , at 7 p.m. ill the<br />\nListening-Viewing Room of the<br />\nStudent Union.
