Codd, of Loyola College, with<br />\nJoseph T. Bartlett, Jr., of Hopkins,<br />\nsecond.'<br />\nJames P. Needham,of Georgetown<br />\nUniversity, was the first speaker of<br />\nthe evening. His oration was on \"International Peace,\" and in it he<br />\npainted a graphic picture of the<br />\nesent European. war and what it<br />\nmeant to the peace movement. His<br />\nvoice was good, his gestures natural<br />\nand his speech well arranged.<br />\nLuther T. Mile, Jr., of St. John's<br />\nCollege, spoke next on the same<br />\nsubject. He dealt rather with the<br />\nsubject of peace as an issue of civilization, why it was to 1))e desired and<br />\nhow it was to be achieved. His<br />\nspeech, while ably thought out, was<br />\nnot as well delivered as that of the<br />\nprevious speaker.<br />\nThe next orator was Joseph T.<br />\nBartlett, Jr., who, representing<br />\nHopkins, spoke , on \"The Challenge<br />\nof the Times.\" His speech was an<br />\nattack against nationalism and militarism, a weighing of the past and a<br />\nplanning of the future. .Bartlett<br />\nmore than justified the confidence<br />\nplaced in him, speaking in a calm,<br />\nimpressive fashion and presenting<br />\nhis strong arguments in a way<br />\nwhich held the audience suspended<br />\nuntil his very last utterance.<br />\nThe final speaker of the evening,<br />\nLeo A. Codd, of Loyola College,<br />\nhowever, surpassed all the other<br />\nparticipants in the ease of his delivery and in the effective manner<br />\nin which he handled his remarkably<br />\nclear voice. He spoke on \"Peace<br />\nand the Individual,\" and although<br />\nhe acquitted himself almost faultlessly as a speaker, his subject matter was not up to the standard set<br />\nby the previous speakers.<br />\nThe announcement of the aard<br />\nwas made by Rev. C. A. Rubenstein on behalf of his fellow judges,<br />\nMessrs. William H. Morris, Henry<br />\nD. Mentzel, Edwin T. Dickerson<br />\nand Charles H. Knapp.<br />\nMr. Theodore Marburg was the<br />\npresiding officer of the evening, and<br />\nwhile awaiting the decision of the<br />\njudges himself delivered a brief<br />\nsummary of the effect which the<br />\npresent war has had upon the peace<br />\nmovement. He, as well as Dr.<br />\nRubenstein, called attention to the<br />\nfact that the whole movement was<br />\nbenefited by the holding of these<br />\ncontests and by the orations of such<br />\nmen as the contestants of the evening.<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins will have the privilege of hearing three men of note<br />\nthis week. Dr. John Calvin Ferguson, who for many years held important positions in China, will<br />\nspeak Monday, March 22, at 5 P.<br />\nM. on \"Chinese Art,\" a subject in<br />\nregard to which there is no better<br />\nauthority. Dr. Ferguson was for<br />\nnine years president of Nanking<br />\nUniversity and for five years president of Nanyang University. He<br />\nhas been connected with the Chinese<br />\nGovernment for a number of years,<br />\nand only resigned office to devote<br />\nhis time more fully to literary and<br />\nart. studies. It will be an opportunity to hear one so eminently qualified to speak on a little known subject, for the art of the Orient is<br />\npeculiar to itself and scarcely understood by many.<br />\nOn Monday night at 8 o'clock<br />\nMr. Harrington Emerson will give<br />\nthe second lecture of four, which<br />\nhe is delivering under the auspices<br />\nof the Department of Engineering.<br />\nProminent in financial work, he<br />\ngained wide recognition as an efficiency engineer on account of his<br />\nresults on the Santa Fe System.<br />\nHe has written a number of books<br />\nbearing upon his profession, such<br />\nas \"Efficiency as the Basis for Operation and Wages,\" and \"The<br />\nTwelve Principles of Efficiency.\"<br />\nThe subject of Mr. Emerson's lecture Monday evening will be \"The<br />\nFundamentals of Organization.\"<br />\nDr. David Talbot Day, of the<br />\nUnited States Bureau of Mines,<br />\nwho will give illustrated lectures<br />\nTuesday and Wednesday, March<br />\n23 and 24, at 5 P. M., in McCoy<br />\nHall, received his A.B. and Ph.D.<br />\ndegrees from Hopkins in 1881 and<br />\n1884. Since that time he has been<br />\nconnected with the United States<br />\nGeological Survey as director of<br />\nthe mining and mineral resources<br />\ndivisions, and since 1907, in charge<br />\nof the petroleum investigations. Dr.<br />\nDay is a geologist of note, and his<br />\nlectures promise to be of value to<br />\nall those interested in that subject,<br />\nor to those desirous of knowing the<br />\nmineral resources and wealth of the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\n<br />\nThe Board of Managers of the<br />\nMusical Clubs began the work of<br />\nwidening the scope of their activity<br />\nlast Tuesday, when a large number<br />\nof candidates answered President<br />\nBaker's call for the organization of<br />\na mandolin club. This club will<br />\nstart out on its work directly following the Easter examinations, and<br />\nwill work in conjunction with the<br />\ntwo clubs which formerly made up<br />\nthe Combined, Musical Clubs.<br />\nAlthough it would seem that this<br />\nis a late time for the organization<br />\nof another musical activity, the<br />\nmanagement has entered into this<br />\nnew field with a view to increasing the efficiency of the clubs as a<br />\nwhole for several important concerts and trips which it hopes to<br />\narrange between now and the end<br />\nof the year. The need for such a<br />\nclub has been felt for some time, and<br />\nin view of the possibility of several<br />\nimportant engagements in the near<br />\nfuture, an attempt will be made<br />\nto put the club well on its feet in<br />\nas short a space of time as possible.<br />\nThe leader of the new club will<br />\nbe L. L. Jacobs, '13, who is a student at the Medical School. Mr.<br />\nJacobs has for some time enjoyed<br />\nthe distinction of being one of the<br />\nbest mandolin players in this part<br />\nof the country, and the club is fortunate in having his services as<br />\ndirector. The club will be made<br />\nup of mandolins, mandolutes, banjomandolins, banjos, guitars, ukulele<br />\nand bass banjo. Rehearsals will be<br />\nheld twice a week.<br />\nAfter their concert at Catonsville,<br />\nin which the Glee and Instrumental<br />\nClubs attained to the usual degree<br />\nof success which has. marked their<br />\nwork this season, the musicians decided to take a rest during the period directly preceding examinations. There will be several concerts after the Easter vacation, and<br />\nthe management is working steadily<br />\non plans for an extended trip, details of which will be announced as<br />\nsoon as matters are more firmly in<br />\nhand.<br />\nThe season will this year extend<br />\nto the end of the academic term<br />\nin June, or possibly later. This<br />\nunusual length of schedule is due<br />\npartly to the fact that the clubs<br />\nwere late in starting out this year,<br />\nowing to the difficulties of reorganization, and partly to the desire on<br />\nthe part of the management to get<br />\nthe organization in as good a condition as possible for the season of<br />\n<br />\nCharles Francis Adams, publicist,<br />\ndied of pneumonia at 2 o'clock<br />\non Friday morning at his winter<br />\nhome, 1701 Massachusetts avenue,<br />\nWashington, D.

I., at the time of their marriage<br />\nNovember 8, 1865, was with him.<br />\nHe left two sons and three daughters. His great-grandfather was<br />\nJohn Adams,.the second President<br />\nof the United States, and his grandfather, John Quincy Adams, was<br />\nthe sixth President. He was the<br />\nson, of Charles Francis Adams,<br />\nminister to England, and his mother<br />\nwas Abigail Brown Brooks, of Boston, where he was born May 27,<br />\n1835.<br />\nThe career of Charles Francis<br />\nAdams included the activities of<br />\nsoldier, author, historian, orator and<br />\nrailway management. Like other<br />\nmembers of his distinguished family, he was a graduate of Harvard<br />\nUniversity, in the class of 3856, and<br />\ntwo years later he was admitted to<br />\nthe Massachusetts bar. He served<br />\nthrough the Civil War, entering<br />\nthe Union Army as lieutenant in<br />\nthe First Massachusetts Cavalry,<br />\nDecember 28, 1861, was promoted<br />\nto captain after a year's service, and<br />\nwas successively lieutenant-colonel,<br />\ncolonel and brevet brigadier-general<br />\nof the Fifth Massachusetts Volunteers during the last two years of<br />\nthe war.<br />\nMr. Adams was known as one of<br />\nthe foremost historians of the country, his interest chiefly being centered in the history and the political and economic problems of the<br />\nUnited States. A large part of his<br />\nwritings had to do with the Civil<br />\nWar. A biography of his father,<br />\nincluding a review of the diplomatic<br />\nnegotiations between the United<br />\nStates and Great Britain over Civil<br />\nWar problems, is considered one of<br />\nhis notable books.<br />\nHe gave on several occasions series of lectures at Johns Hopkins,<br />\nand was always received with much<br />\nenthusiasm.<br />\nHis civic work included the chairmanship of the committee which<br />\nplanned the metropolitan park system in Boston and vicinity. He<br />\nwas an overseer of Harvard University from 1892 to 1907.<br />\nAlthough he never sought public office, Charles Francis Adams<br />\ntook an active part in political affairs, but always as an independent,<br />\nboth in his speeches and writings.<br />\nHe was an anti-imperialist and<br />\n<br />\nThe musical program for the<br />\nevening was given by E.

Codd, of Loyola College, with<br />\nJoseph T. Bartlett, Jr., of Hopkins,<br />\nsecond.'<br />\nJames P. Needham,of Georgetown<br />\nUniversity, was the first speaker of<br />\nthe evening. His oration was on \"International Peace,\" and in it he<br />\npainted a graphic picture of the<br />\nesent European. war and what it<br />\nmeant to the peace movement. His<br />\nvoice was good, his gestures natural<br />\nand his speech well arranged.<br />\nLuther T. Mile, Jr., of St. John's<br />\nCollege, spoke next on the same<br />\nsubject. He dealt rather with the<br />\nsubject of peace as an issue of civilization, why it was to 1))e desired and<br />\nhow it was to be achieved. His<br />\nspeech, while ably thought out, was<br />\nnot as well delivered as that of the<br />\nprevious speaker.<br />\nThe next orator was Joseph T.<br />\nBartlett, Jr., who, representing<br />\nHopkins, spoke , on \"The Challenge<br />\nof the Times.\" His speech was an<br />\nattack against nationalism and militarism, a weighing of the past and a<br />\nplanning of the future. .Bartlett<br />\nmore than justified the confidence<br />\nplaced in him, speaking in a calm,<br />\nimpressive fashion and presenting<br />\nhis strong arguments in a way<br />\nwhich held the audience suspended<br />\nuntil his very last utterance.<br />\nThe final speaker of the evening,<br />\nLeo A. Codd, of Loyola College,<br />\nhowever, surpassed all the other<br />\nparticipants in the ease of his delivery and in the effective manner<br />\nin which he handled his remarkably<br />\nclear voice. He spoke on \"Peace<br />\nand the Individual,\" and although<br />\nhe acquitted himself almost faultlessly as a speaker, his subject matter was not up to the standard set<br />\nby the previous speakers.<br />\nThe announcement of the aard<br />\nwas made by Rev. C. A. Rubenstein on behalf of his fellow judges,<br />\nMessrs. William H. Morris, Henry<br />\nD. Mentzel, Edwin T. Dickerson<br />\nand Charles H. Knapp.<br />\nMr. Theodore Marburg was the<br />\npresiding officer of the evening, and<br />\nwhile awaiting the decision of the<br />\njudges himself delivered a brief<br />\nsummary of the effect which the<br />\npresent war has had upon the peace<br />\nmovement. He, as well as Dr.<br />\nRubenstein, called attention to the<br />\nfact that the whole movement was<br />\nbenefited by the holding of these<br />\ncontests and by the orations of such<br />\nmen as the contestants of the evening.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins will have the privilege of hearing three men of note<br />\nthis week. Dr. John Calvin Ferguson, who for many years held important positions in China, will<br />\nspeak Monday, March 22, at 5 P.<br />\nM. on \"Chinese Art,\" a subject in<br />\nregard to which there is no better<br />\nauthority. Dr. Ferguson was for<br />\nnine years president of Nanking<br />\nUniversity and for five years president of Nanyang University. He<br />\nhas been connected with the Chinese<br />\nGovernment for a number of years,<br />\nand only resigned office to devote<br />\nhis time more fully to literary and<br />\nart. studies. It will be an opportunity to hear one so eminently qualified to speak on a little known subject, for the art of the Orient is<br />\npeculiar to itself and scarcely understood by many.<br />\nOn Monday night at 8 o'clock<br />\nMr. Harrington Emerson will give<br />\nthe second lecture of four, which<br />\nhe is delivering under the auspices<br />\nof the Department of Engineering.<br />\nProminent in financial work, he<br />\ngained wide recognition as an efficiency engineer on account of his<br />\nresults on the Santa Fe System.<br />\nHe has written a number of books<br />\nbearing upon his profession, such<br />\nas \"Efficiency as the Basis for Operation and Wages,\" and \"The<br />\nTwelve Principles of Efficiency.\"<br />\nThe subject of Mr. Emerson's lecture Monday evening will be \"The<br />\nFundamentals of Organization.\"<br />\nDr. David Talbot Day, of the<br />\nUnited States Bureau of Mines,<br />\nwho will give illustrated lectures<br />\nTuesday and Wednesday, March<br />\n23 and 24, at 5 P. M., in McCoy<br />\nHall, received his A.B. and Ph.D.<br />\ndegrees from Hopkins in 1881 and<br />\n1884. Since that time he has been<br />\nconnected with the United States<br />\nGeological Survey as director of<br />\nthe mining and mineral resources<br />\ndivisions, and since 1907, in charge<br />\nof the petroleum investigations. Dr.<br />\nDay is a geologist of note, and his<br />\nlectures promise to be of value to<br />\nall those interested in that subject,<br />\nor to those desirous of knowing the<br />\nmineral resources and wealth of the<br />\nUnited States.<br /><br />\nThe Board of Managers of the<br />\nMusical Clubs began the work of<br />\nwidening the scope of their activity<br />\nlast Tuesday, when a large number<br />\nof candidates answered President<br />\nBaker's call for the organization of<br />\na mandolin club. This club will<br />\nstart out on its work directly following the Easter examinations, and<br />\nwill work in conjunction with the<br />\ntwo clubs which formerly made up<br />\nthe Combined, Musical Clubs.<br />\nAlthough it would seem that this<br />\nis a late time for the organization<br />\nof another musical activity, the<br />\nmanagement has entered into this<br />\nnew field with a view to increasing the efficiency of the clubs as a<br />\nwhole for several important concerts and trips which it hopes to<br />\narrange between now and the end<br />\nof the year. The need for such a<br />\nclub has been felt for some time, and<br />\nin view of the possibility of several<br />\nimportant engagements in the near<br />\nfuture, an attempt will be made<br />\nto put the club well on its feet in<br />\nas short a space of time as possible.<br />\nThe leader of the new club will<br />\nbe L. L. Jacobs, '13, who is a student at the Medical School. Mr.<br />\nJacobs has for some time enjoyed<br />\nthe distinction of being one of the<br />\nbest mandolin players in this part<br />\nof the country, and the club is fortunate in having his services as<br />\ndirector. The club will be made<br />\nup of mandolins, mandolutes, banjomandolins, banjos, guitars, ukulele<br />\nand bass banjo. Rehearsals will be<br />\nheld twice a week.<br />\nAfter their concert at Catonsville,<br />\nin which the Glee and Instrumental<br />\nClubs attained to the usual degree<br />\nof success which has. marked their<br />\nwork this season, the musicians decided to take a rest during the period directly preceding examinations. There will be several concerts after the Easter vacation, and<br />\nthe management is working steadily<br />\non plans for an extended trip, details of which will be announced as<br />\nsoon as matters are more firmly in<br />\nhand.<br />\nThe season will this year extend<br />\nto the end of the academic term<br />\nin June, or possibly later. This<br />\nunusual length of schedule is due<br />\npartly to the fact that the clubs<br />\nwere late in starting out this year,<br />\nowing to the difficulties of reorganization, and partly to the desire on<br />\nthe part of the management to get<br />\nthe organization in as good a condition as possible for the season of<br /><br />\nCharles Francis Adams, publicist,<br />\ndied of pneumonia at 2 o'clock<br />\non Friday morning at his winter<br />\nhome, 1701 Massachusetts avenue,<br />\nWashington, D.

I., at the time of their marriage<br />\nNovember 8, 1865, was with him.<br />\nHe left two sons and three daughters. His great-grandfather was<br />\nJohn Adams,.the second President<br />\nof the United States, and his grandfather, John Quincy Adams, was<br />\nthe sixth President. He was the<br />\nson, of Charles Francis Adams,<br />\nminister to England, and his mother<br />\nwas Abigail Brown Brooks, of Boston, where he was born May 27,<br />\n1835.<br />\nThe career of Charles Francis<br />\nAdams included the activities of<br />\nsoldier, author, historian, orator and<br />\nrailway management. Like other<br />\nmembers of his distinguished family, he was a graduate of Harvard<br />\nUniversity, in the class of 3856, and<br />\ntwo years later he was admitted to<br />\nthe Massachusetts bar. He served<br />\nthrough the Civil War, entering<br />\nthe Union Army as lieutenant in<br />\nthe First Massachusetts Cavalry,<br />\nDecember 28, 1861, was promoted<br />\nto captain after a year's service, and<br />\nwas successively lieutenant-colonel,<br />\ncolonel and brevet brigadier-general<br />\nof the Fifth Massachusetts Volunteers during the last two years of<br />\nthe war.<br />\nMr. Adams was known as one of<br />\nthe foremost historians of the country, his interest chiefly being centered in the history and the political and economic problems of the<br />\nUnited States. A large part of his<br />\nwritings had to do with the Civil<br />\nWar. A biography of his father,<br />\nincluding a review of the diplomatic<br />\nnegotiations between the United<br />\nStates and Great Britain over Civil<br />\nWar problems, is considered one of<br />\nhis notable books.<br />\nHe gave on several occasions series of lectures at Johns Hopkins,<br />\nand was always received with much<br />\nenthusiasm.<br />\nHis civic work included the chairmanship of the committee which<br />\nplanned the metropolitan park system in Boston and vicinity. He<br />\nwas an overseer of Harvard University from 1892 to 1907.<br />\nAlthough he never sought public office, Charles Francis Adams<br />\ntook an active part in political affairs, but always as an independent,<br />\nboth in his speeches and writings.<br />\nHe was an anti-imperialist and<br /><br />\nThe musical program for the<br />\nevening was given by E.
