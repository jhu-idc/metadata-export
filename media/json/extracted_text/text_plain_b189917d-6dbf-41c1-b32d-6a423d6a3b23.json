The latest to come<br />\nto our attention is the cancellation, at the University of Wisconsin, of a talk by Mrs. Bertrand Russell, of whom the dean<br />\nof men of that college said \"The quotations attributed to her<br />\nWere unworthy of any speaker who was invited to speak on<br />\na university platform.\"<br />\nAccording to the interpretation which we must necessarily<br />\nput upon the practice of excluding more or less \"revolutionary\" speakers, stimulation of speculation and discussion<br />\namong undergraduates concerning the problems with which<br />\nthey are about to come face to face is not a salutary thing.<br />\nIt is not good for the youthful, susceptible, easily-impressed<br />\nstudent to hear people talk about the horrors of war, or companionate marriages, or the flaws in our economic system.<br />\nApparently, the less they know about the difficulties with<br />\nwhich they will have to grapple, the better off they are!<br />\nThis introduction of Middle Age practice into twentieth<br />\ncentury education is greatly to be deplored.
