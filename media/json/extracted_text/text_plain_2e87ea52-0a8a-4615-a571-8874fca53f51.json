This committee is<br />\nnow working in conjunction with some students to decide matters of<br />\nvital importance for the future of Johns Hopkins.<br />\nThe significance of this step lies in the fact that it marks an entire<br />\nreversal of the attitude of the University authorities toward the undergraduate schools. Ever since the advent of the Goodnow Plan, Alma<br />\nMater has been a step-mother to the undergraduates. In the first rush<br />\nof enthusiasm for a purely graduate school, the undergraduates, to put<br />\nit plainly, were somewhat neglected. Courses were cut out of the curriculum, five professors gave up their undergraduate classes, and an<br />\nincrease in enrollment in the College was not urgently desired. We<br />\nbelieve that this old policy is dead, that a new era has started in which<br />\nthe undergraduate schools will not only recover their former prestige,<br />\nbut will surpass it. Perhaps we have been too harsh in writing of the<br />\npast, perhaps we attach too much importance to the present, perhaps<br />\nwe are too optimistic as regards the future. Nevertheless, it seems to<br />\nus that the investigation now being conducted represents a change of<br />\npolicy that will prove of great benefit. The essential point is not that<br />\nthe committee may recommend great changes, it is that an effort is<br />\nbeing made to improve the undergraduate colleges by facing facts.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe problems being discussed range all the way from additions<br />\nto the curriculum to what may be done for activities. Perhaps the most<br />\nimportant problem is whether the University now offers sufficient<br />\ncourses to enable each student to acquire a liberal education, and if<br />\nthe answer is no (as we confidently expect it to be) what courses should<br />\nbe added. We can suggest quite a few: Political Economy courses, such<br />\nas Accounting and Money and Banking should be instituted for men<br />\nin the College of Arts and Sciences; there is room for several English<br />\ncourses, such as the modern novel, modern drama, and several courses<br />\nspecializing in two or three authors to supplement the survey courses<br />\nnow being given; in French a course in nineteenth and twentieth century literature would be well attended. These are a few suggestions for<br />\nnew courses, but a much easier step could be made which would greatly<br />\nenrich the curriculum. That is to compel the high and mighty Business<br />\nEconomics faculty to thiow open more of their courses to students in<br />\nother colleges and to abolish some of the pre-requisites in that school.<br />\nAt present we are in a benign mood; we are at peace with the world;<br />\nso we cannot do this subject justice. But when our digestion fails,<br />\nwhen some other misfortune occurs to make us slightly bitter, we shall<br />\nthen take up the question of the \"splendid isolation\" of the Business<br />\nSchool more fully.<br />\nThe committee is also considering the question of advisers. The<br />\nsystem we have at present, whereby each instructor has several students<br />\nunder his wing is far from satisfactory. Many of the instructors regard<br />\nthe system as a nuisance and a time-waster for themselves. And justly<br />\nso. The faculty has been chosen with the view that they are men<br />\nqualified to teach their particular subject. It is no part of their duty to<br />\nguide bewildered freshmen through the wage of college. The office<br />\nof Assistant Dean should be created and he could be assisted by five<br />\nseniors each year. The advantages of this plan are two-fold. First, the<br />\nassistant would be a man who would be thoroughly acquainted with<br />\nthe curriculum and the peculiarities of each course and, secondly, hc<br />\nwould have the time and would be paid to advise so that each man<br />\nwould be given careful consideration instead of being treated in a<br />\nhaphazard fashion. It would be advantageous to have him assisted by<br />\nseniors as they would be men who had just recently taken the courses<br />\nin the College, and consequently would be able to explain to the<br />\nAssistant Dean any changes which the professors make in their courses<br />\n\u2022<br />\nfrom year to year.<br />\n<br />\nTechnique<br />\nFirst\u2014<br />\nthen 'up and at lend<br />\nMOKING a pipe is like flying<br />\nan airplane\u2014you really ought<br />\nto know how, if you're hoping to<br />\nenjoy it much.<br />\nPipe technique can be picked up<br />\nthrough experience, or it can be<br />\nlearned outright.

SPEAR<br />\nAnother period of \"Sturm and Drang\" has passed and another set of examinations belongs to the past. The present marking system is making its last stand against reform. Well may we<br />\nsigh with relief that shortly undergraduates are no longer to be<br />\nslaves to a string of marks. But while the faculty was so busy reforming the marking system, it neglected the very important task<br />\nof reforming itself, the markers. Long have we undergraduates<br />\npleaded for the establishment of equal standards among the various instructors in the college and yet our pleas remain unnoticed<br />\nand we have been forced to abide by the arbitrary set of standards<br />\nestablished by individual instructors. Will the new marking system relieve this difficulty to any extent? Obviously not, for every<br />\nmember of the faculty still will have different ideas as to who<br />\namong his students may be classed as an honor student. Some<br />\ncynical and hard-hearted members of the faculty believe none of<br />\nus is worthy of being designated as better than satisfactory; others are too generous in granting honors to those of us who may<br />\nmake a good impression by some chance performance which may<br />\nhave been meaningless. A111 degrees of difference lie between these<br />\ntwo extremes and each student is compared with his fellows on a<br />\ndifferent basis. The scholarship committee may think that numerical averages form a sound means for awarding honors, the Phi<br />\nBeta Kappa Society may award its key to men with the highest<br />\naverage, but neither has a reliable source for its judgments.<br />\nTwo men with equal ability who have done equal amounts of work<br />\nmay under either the present or future system be classified in separate divisions as to their respective merits.<br />\nAgain, I say, the faculty should adopt some agreement<br />\namong all its members so that a uniform system may result which<br />\nwill take into account the varying difficulty of different subjects<br />\nand what may be reasonably expected from a conscientious student.<br />\nThe trend indicated by the new marking system is the establishment of standards of scholarship among the undergraduates in<br />\naccord with those already existing in the graduate school. The<br />\npurpose of any marking system is to establish a basis on which<br />\na student may judge the results of his own labor in comparison<br />\nwith the rest of the student body. If his work is satisfactory it<br />\nwill be so designated and if he is far better than average, he<br />\nwill have the satisfaction of knowing this. But what good does<br />\nsuch a system accomplish? It will remove any attempts to judge<br />\n.and compare students by the actual percentage of given knowledge which they have learnt to appy-; but aside from this it is not<br />\nmuch of an improvement.<br />\nIf the faculty is actually sincere in its desire to establish the<br />\nideal system, then let there be no system at all. A complete abolition of any form of marking whatsoever is more highly desirable<br />\nthan any possible system involving marks. A college student is supposedly a seeker of knowledge. The teacher is there to aid his students in acquiring this knowledge, and his should not be the duty<br />\n.of passing judgment. A man comes to college to equip himself for<br />\nlife and only the future will tell whether he has been sucecssful.<br />\nThe world in which he makes his living will be the real judge of<br />\nhis accomplishments and ability. A true teacher is one whose superior knowledge equips him to become a source and radiating<br />\n.center of information. Coming to the teacher with a respect for<br />\nhis knowledge and the desire to partake of it even as Aristotle<br />\nlearnt from Plato, the student should be on a thoroughly friendly<br />\nbasis with his teachers. As long as teachers are required to officially judge their pupils, no true feeling of friendship can arise<br />\nbetween the two. Once, however, the student knows that upon<br />\nhimself alone rests the burden of accomplishment then will he regard his teachers in a purely unselfish light. There will be no need<br />\nto distinguish between handshaking and sincerity\u2014the former<br />\nwill have no purpose.<br />\nOf course, the plan will meet with objections. The average<br />\ncollege .student needs constant driving if he is to acquire knowledge. This plan however is not concerned with the average student, for Hopkins is endeavoring to avoid mediocrity. Raise entrance requirements and eliminate many of the undesirables who<br />\n,are wasting their time in college. Those who do get in and yet do<br />\nnot work will cause no trouble, for the knowledge is there to be<br />\nabsorbed by those who want it; while those who ignore it are<br />\ndigging their own graves. The teacher will be there for those who<br />\nwant him, the others he need not worry about. Marks are not<br />\nnecessary. The only spur to industry should be the desire and<br />\nthirst for knowledge. Let us relegate such systems embodying<br />\nthe threats of roll calls, and quizzes of high school calibre to the<br />\ndiscord in favor of a more mature plan whose only attraction is<br />\nknowledge.<br />\n<br />\nPRIZE ESSAY CONTEST<br />\nOPEN TO STUDENTS<br />\nSponsored by Robert Schalkenback Foundation<br />\n$200 IN PRIZES<br />\nSubject Bared on Teachings of<br />\nHenry George<br />\n(Continued from Page 6, Col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nProgress and Poverty (cloth) by<br />\n$1.00<br />\nHenry George<br />\nSame in paper edition .50<br />\nAbridged edition of the<br />\nsame<br />\n.50<br />\nSignificant Paragraphs<br />\nfrom Progress and Poverty with introduction<br />\n.50<br />\nby John Dewey<br />\n2.

In the first rush<br />\nof enthusiasm for a purely graduate school, the undergraduates, to put<br />\nit plainly, were somewhat neglected. Courses were cut out of the curriculum, five professors gave up their undergraduate classes, and an<br />\nincrease in enrollment in the College was not urgently desired. We<br />\nbelieve that this old policy is dead, that a new era has started in which<br />\nthe undergraduate schools will not only recover their former prestige,<br />\nbut will surpass it. Perhaps we have been too harsh in writing of the<br />\npast, perhaps we attach too much importance to the present, perhaps<br />\nwe are too optimistic as regards the future. Nevertheless, it seems to<br />\nus that the investigation now being conducted represents a change of<br />\npolicy that will prove of great benefit. The essential point is not that<br />\nthe committee may recommend great changes, it is that an effort is<br />\nbeing made to improve the undergraduate colleges by facing facts.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThe problems being discussed range all the way from additions<br />\nto the curriculum to what may be done for activities. Perhaps the most<br />\nimportant problem is whether the University now offers sufficient<br />\ncourses to enable each student to acquire a liberal education, and if<br />\nthe answer is no (as we confidently expect it to be) what courses should<br />\nbe added. We can suggest quite a few: Political Economy courses, such<br />\nas Accounting and Money and Banking should be instituted for men<br />\nin the College of Arts and Sciences; there is room for several English<br />\ncourses, such as the modern novel, modern drama, and several courses<br />\nspecializing in two or three authors to supplement the survey courses<br />\nnow being given; in French a course in nineteenth and twentieth century literature would be well attended. These are a few suggestions for<br />\nnew courses, but a much easier step could be made which would greatly<br />\nenrich the curriculum. That is to compel the high and mighty Business<br />\nEconomics faculty to thiow open more of their courses to students in<br />\nother colleges and to abolish some of the pre-requisites in that school.<br />\nAt present we are in a benign mood; we are at peace with the world;<br />\nso we cannot do this subject justice. But when our digestion fails,<br />\nwhen some other misfortune occurs to make us slightly bitter, we shall<br />\nthen take up the question of the \"splendid isolation\" of the Business<br />\nSchool more fully.<br />\nThe committee is also considering the question of advisers. The<br />\nsystem we have at present, whereby each instructor has several students<br />\nunder his wing is far from satisfactory. Many of the instructors regard<br />\nthe system as a nuisance and a time-waster for themselves. And justly<br />\nso. The faculty has been chosen with the view that they are men<br />\nqualified to teach their particular subject. It is no part of their duty to<br />\nguide bewildered freshmen through the wage of college. The office<br />\nof Assistant Dean should be created and he could be assisted by five<br />\nseniors each year. The advantages of this plan are two-fold. First, the<br />\nassistant would be a man who would be thoroughly acquainted with<br />\nthe curriculum and the peculiarities of each course and, secondly, hc<br />\nwould have the time and would be paid to advise so that each man<br />\nwould be given careful consideration instead of being treated in a<br />\nhaphazard fashion. It would be advantageous to have him assisted by<br />\nseniors as they would be men who had just recently taken the courses<br />\nin the College, and consequently would be able to explain to the<br />\nAssistant Dean any changes which the professors make in their courses<br />\n\u2022<br />\nfrom year to year.<br /><br />\nTechnique<br />\nFirst\u2014<br />\nthen 'up and at lend<br />\nMOKING a pipe is like flying<br />\nan airplane\u2014you really ought<br />\nto know how, if you're hoping to<br />\nenjoy it much.<br />\nPipe technique can be picked up<br />\nthrough experience, or it can be<br />\nlearned outright.

SPEAR<br />\nAnother period of \"Sturm and Drang\" has passed and another set of examinations belongs to the past. The present marking system is making its last stand against reform. Well may we<br />\nsigh with relief that shortly undergraduates are no longer to be<br />\nslaves to a string of marks. But while the faculty was so busy reforming the marking system, it neglected the very important task<br />\nof reforming itself, the markers. Long have we undergraduates<br />\npleaded for the establishment of equal standards among the various instructors in the college and yet our pleas remain unnoticed<br />\nand we have been forced to abide by the arbitrary set of standards<br />\nestablished by individual instructors. Will the new marking system relieve this difficulty to any extent? Obviously not, for every<br />\nmember of the faculty still will have different ideas as to who<br />\namong his students may be classed as an honor student. Some<br />\ncynical and hard-hearted members of the faculty believe none of<br />\nus is worthy of being designated as better than satisfactory; others are too generous in granting honors to those of us who may<br />\nmake a good impression by some chance performance which may<br />\nhave been meaningless. A111 degrees of difference lie between these<br />\ntwo extremes and each student is compared with his fellows on a<br />\ndifferent basis. The scholarship committee may think that numerical averages form a sound means for awarding honors, the Phi<br />\nBeta Kappa Society may award its key to men with the highest<br />\naverage, but neither has a reliable source for its judgments.<br />\nTwo men with equal ability who have done equal amounts of work<br />\nmay under either the present or future system be classified in separate divisions as to their respective merits.<br />\nAgain, I say, the faculty should adopt some agreement<br />\namong all its members so that a uniform system may result which<br />\nwill take into account the varying difficulty of different subjects<br />\nand what may be reasonably expected from a conscientious student.<br />\nThe trend indicated by the new marking system is the establishment of standards of scholarship among the undergraduates in<br />\naccord with those already existing in the graduate school. The<br />\npurpose of any marking system is to establish a basis on which<br />\na student may judge the results of his own labor in comparison<br />\nwith the rest of the student body. If his work is satisfactory it<br />\nwill be so designated and if he is far better than average, he<br />\nwill have the satisfaction of knowing this. But what good does<br />\nsuch a system accomplish? It will remove any attempts to judge<br />\n.and compare students by the actual percentage of given knowledge which they have learnt to appy-; but aside from this it is not<br />\nmuch of an improvement.<br />\nIf the faculty is actually sincere in its desire to establish the<br />\nideal system, then let there be no system at all. A complete abolition of any form of marking whatsoever is more highly desirable<br />\nthan any possible system involving marks. A college student is supposedly a seeker of knowledge. The teacher is there to aid his students in acquiring this knowledge, and his should not be the duty<br />\n.of passing judgment. A man comes to college to equip himself for<br />\nlife and only the future will tell whether he has been sucecssful.<br />\nThe world in which he makes his living will be the real judge of<br />\nhis accomplishments and ability. A true teacher is one whose superior knowledge equips him to become a source and radiating<br />\n.center of information. Coming to the teacher with a respect for<br />\nhis knowledge and the desire to partake of it even as Aristotle<br />\nlearnt from Plato, the student should be on a thoroughly friendly<br />\nbasis with his teachers. As long as teachers are required to officially judge their pupils, no true feeling of friendship can arise<br />\nbetween the two. Once, however, the student knows that upon<br />\nhimself alone rests the burden of accomplishment then will he regard his teachers in a purely unselfish light. There will be no need<br />\nto distinguish between handshaking and sincerity\u2014the former<br />\nwill have no purpose.<br />\nOf course, the plan will meet with objections. The average<br />\ncollege .student needs constant driving if he is to acquire knowledge. This plan however is not concerned with the average student, for Hopkins is endeavoring to avoid mediocrity. Raise entrance requirements and eliminate many of the undesirables who<br />\n,are wasting their time in college. Those who do get in and yet do<br />\nnot work will cause no trouble, for the knowledge is there to be<br />\nabsorbed by those who want it; while those who ignore it are<br />\ndigging their own graves. The teacher will be there for those who<br />\nwant him, the others he need not worry about. Marks are not<br />\nnecessary. The only spur to industry should be the desire and<br />\nthirst for knowledge. Let us relegate such systems embodying<br />\nthe threats of roll calls, and quizzes of high school calibre to the<br />\ndiscord in favor of a more mature plan whose only attraction is<br />\nknowledge.<br /><br />\nPRIZE ESSAY CONTEST<br />\nOPEN TO STUDENTS<br />\nSponsored by Robert Schalkenback Foundation<br />\n$200 IN PRIZES<br />\nSubject Bared on Teachings of<br />\nHenry George<br />\n(Continued from Page 6, Col. 3)<br /><br />\nProgress and Poverty (cloth) by<br />\n$1.00<br />\nHenry George<br />\nSame in paper edition .50<br />\nAbridged edition of the<br />\nsame<br />\n.50<br />\nSignificant Paragraphs<br />\nfrom Progress and Poverty with introduction<br />\n.50<br />\nby John Dewey<br />\n2.
