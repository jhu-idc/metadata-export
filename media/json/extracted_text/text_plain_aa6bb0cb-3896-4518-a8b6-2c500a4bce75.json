It is separated from<br />\nthe mainland by a creek, which is<br />\nfrom two to three hundred feet<br />\nwide, and is connected to the<br />\nmainland by a steel wagon bridge<br />\nand various railroad bridges.<br />\nBefore giving you figures relating to the project, let me say that<br />\nI believe there has been no justification for the attacks which have<br />\nbeen made on this project or<br />\nthose responsible for it.<br />\nThe American International<br />\nCorporation engaged the firm of<br />\nStone & Webster, of Boston, to<br />\nundertake the work, and it has'<br />\nthus far been put through with<br />\nthe customary energy and foresight for which that firm has<br />\nearned its high reputation.<br />\nStone & Webster have done many<br />\nof the biggest engineering jobs ever<br />\nundertaken. Among them: The<br />\nMississippi River Power Development at Keakuk, $40,000,000; the<br />\nPacific Light and Power Company<br />\nBig Creek Development, $20,000,000; the Dallas (Tex.) Terminal<br />\nDevelopment,.$6,000,000, the powerhouses, substations and underground transmission system for<br />\nthe Boston Elevated Railway<br />\nCompany and a great many more<br />\nlarge undertakings, including<br />\ncity gas plants, interurban railways, etc., in this country and<br />\nabroad.<br />\nIt needed only a visit which.the<br />\ncommittee of United States Senators made to Hog Island recently<br />\nto bring about a very different attitude towards the work.

It represents the tribute, in terms of flesh and blood, of a<br />\nhumanitarian institution, which has already paid a great tribute in<br />\nresearch and knowledge, to mankind.<br />\nBut if the service flag is merely to symbolize and immortalize the<br />\nservice of Hopkins' sons, it will not serve its entire purpose. A strip<br />\nof bunting is a poor substitute for<br />\n* mowumentura aere perennius<br />\n*<br />\n\u2022<br />\nregalique situ pyramidium altius,<br />\nquod non imber edax, non Aquilo itnpotens<br />\npossit diruere ant innumerabilis<br />\nannorum series et fuga temporum<br />\n(which means, if our scant memory of Latin does not betray us) \"a monument more enduring than bronze, more sublime than<br />\nthe crumbling mangnificence of kings one that neither the eroding<br />\nrain nor the furious northwind, nor the countless succession of years,<br />\nnor the swift course of time shall be able to destroy.\" The real purpose of the service flag is to inspire those of us who are still at college with the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice that enkindled<br />\nthe hearts of the men represented by blue or gold stars.<br />\nIt is not for us to absorb ourselves with poetic speculations as<br />\nto the number of additional blue stars that will appear, or as to the<br />\nnumber of blue stars that will turn to gold. Let us leave that to<br />\nromantic old ladies. It is for us to discover how we, as college students, can best serve in this national emergency. It is for us who day<br />\nafter day walk\u2014on our way to or from classes\u2014under the flag to translate that symbol of service into our hearts, our words, our deeds.<br />\nWe have been continuing our courses at college because we have<br />\nbeen told that we can best serve our country in that way. It is important to observe that what are often matters of individual welfare<br />\nin times of peace become in times of war patriotic and fundamental<br />\nduties. Some examples, from the standpoint of the college student,<br />\nare: to study, to keep physically fit, to undergo military training, and,<br />\nfinally, to economize. While war is essentially a test of physical<br />\nprowess and endurance, it does not eliminate, but rather accentuates,<br />\nthe need for trained minds; intelligence is needed to direct, control<br />\nand distribute physical force. A new seriousness and earnestness,<br />\nthen, should mark our attitude towards our college courses. We must<br />\nhave undergone a most complete and radical revolution; we should aim<br />\nto learn as much instead of as little as possible; we should take a personal, aggressive, rather than an impersonal, passive, interest in our<br />\nwork.<br />\nWe must look forward to the days beyond the war\u2014the critical<br />\ndays of reconstruction\u2014when the insistent demand for trained intellects will ring throughout our country, throughout the civilized, unkulturized world. In the industrial world there will be an urgent demand for organizers in the educational world there will be a no less<br />\nteachers, in the political\u2014in the broad sense\u2014<br />\nurgent demand for'<br />\nworld there will be a most urgent demand for leaders. Who, if not<br />\nthe college-trained men, are to meet this demand?<br />\nIt is assumed, inasmuch as the end of the war (which will only<br />\ncome with an allied victory) is not yet in sight, that every noncripple in college is preparing himself for eventual service in the<br />\narmed forces of his country. It he is not now physically fit, he is<br />\ngiven through the medium of college athletics every opportunity in<br />\n<br />\nOne of the most promising features of undergraduate activities<br />\nthis year was the spirit evinced by the members of the Battalion before and during the inspection last week. It was an inspiration to<br />\nnote especially in what a whole-hearted way the members of the Battalion responded to the request of Major Guild to drill -an extra half<br />\nhour on Monday. It showed that we had developed a real esprit de<br />\ncorps, real Hopkins spirit, and real respect for our Commandant.<br />\nBut, on Saturday afternoon when the Hopkins baseball and lacrosse teams staged a double victory, after playing in the cold and<br />\nrain on a slippery and soggy field, there was not a handful of Hopkins men to celebrate it. The spirit which was so rampant in the<br />\nearly part of the week had completely melted away in the showers<br />\nof Saturday. If the lacrosse and ball teams could play in that weather,<br />\nthe rest of the student body could certainly have braved an April<br />\nshower to watch and encourage them. Is Hopkins spirit so transient<br />\nthat it cannot be sustained through one, week; so unstable and fragile<br />\nthat it cannot weather a shower?<br />\n<br />\nMore Facts.<br />\nIn the morning papers of last Saturday, there was a notice that<br />\nthe Hopkins tennis team would play City College\u2014a local high school.<br />\nTo the best of our knowledge, there were five Hopkins men who knew<br />\nanything whatsoever about the match; they were the self-appointed<br />\nmanager and four men whom he selected by telephone\u2014and by nothing<br />\nelse\u2014to represent Hopkins. The tennis team receives an annual appropriation of approximately $50.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that on the two teams that scored a double<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022victory at Homewood on Saturday there was not a single graduate<br />\nstudent.<br />\n<br />\nOliver P. Winslow.<br />\nThrough the enlistment of Oliver P.

By doing what is<br />\ncalled \"the fabrication of parts,\"<br />\naway from the yard, the time of<br />\ndelivery of large numbers of ships<br />\ncan be greatly shortened as compared with ordinary shipyard<br />\npractice; and further, it would<br />\nhave been impossible for any existing yard to have extended its<br />\nfacilities so as to make them adequate for carying out any such<br />\nprogram as that undertaken at<br />\nHog Island. It was necessary to<br />\nmake use of practically all the<br />\nfacilities of the United States<br />\nand some in Canada in order to<br />\nget the material for the ships.<br />\nThis has made a tremendous organization necessary and involves<br />\nan extensive system for supplying<br />\ndetailed information to manufacturers and for inspecting and expediting the product. The work<br />\nhas been so carefully planned,<br />\nhowever by the American International<br />\n' Shipbuilding Corporation that the steel already received at the shipyard is fitting<br />\ntogether in the most satisfactory<br />\nmanner, and the precautions<br />\ntaken indicate that all parts of<br />\nthe ships will be assembled in<br />\nmuch quicker time than would<br />\nhave been the case had any excepting a large and experienced<br />\norganization taken hold of the<br />\nproject.<br />\nThe following figures are taken<br />\nfrom a paper written by Mr.<br />\nGeorge J. Baldwin, vice-president of the American International Corporation and chairman<br />\nof the Board of American International Shipbuilding Corporation:<br />\n\"General Goethals' original<br />\nplan was the construction of a<br />\nyard with 50 shipways upon<br />\nwhich 200 vessels all exactly<br />\nalike should be constructed.

Nothing was safe;<br />\nand while some one chased down<br />\nthe aisle of the Pullman after a<br />\ndisappearing hair brush, he returned only to find his shaving<br />\nsoap abducted. Quickly, the disorder became a rough-house -shoes, pillows, trousers, soap,<br />\nclothes of all descriptions flew<br />\nthrough the air.

And at the same time,<br />\n\"Duke\" Lampe nearly created a<br />\nriot, and then had the crowd gasping for breath, when he revealed<br />\nhimself clad in a pair of brilliant<br />\nsky-blue pajamas; it was a dazzling vision.<br />\nMeanwhile, Captain Harris had<br />\nwisely sought the seclusion of his<br />\nsecond-story cradl\u2018; and from this<br />\ncover, he made frequent successful<br />\nsallies on those passing up the<br />\naisle by sticking his feet into the<br />\npasserby's neck. But he did this<br />\nonce too often; and Bitter's watchful eye pierced the offensive member, and his ready hands caught<br />\nhold.

Leadbetter and Captain Firor starred for<br />\nthe Black and Blue, gathering in<br />\n15 points each, while \"Bev\"<br />\nSmith was not far behind them,<br />\nnetting 13 points for the Baltimoreans.

The time keeper's watch<br />\nregistered 12 2/5 seconds, so the<br />\ndistance was measured and was<br />\nfound to be 120 yards instead of<br />\n100.

The 1920 lacrosse squad is already getting<br />\n'under way, and from all accounts this class will be represented by a crack team. There<br />\nare about 15 members from this<br />\nclass practicing with the 'Varsity twelve, and this experience<br />\nwill stand them in good stead<br />\nwhen the two teams meet.<br />\nThe 1920 track team will start<br />\npracticing some time in the near<br />\nfuture. When Capt. \"Dan\" Bratt<br />\ncalls his runners out he will have<br />\nnearly the same team which won<br />\nthe championship for the Sophomores last year. The entire relay<br />\nteam, with the exception of \"Bob\"<br />\nWagner, will again be present to<br />\nrepeat the, same feat they did<br />\nlast year. Then, too, with other<br />\nmen, such as Driver, \"Bev\"<br />\nSmith, L. G.

His<br />\ncontrol was very bad and his offerings were to the liking of the<br />\nHopkins batters. After he had<br />\nwalked the first three men that<br />\nhad faced him and several hits had<br />\nbeen gathered off his delivery he<br />\nwas forced to gve way to Kearney,<br />\nwho did not fare much better.<br />\nWelliver, who was on the<br />\nmound for Hopkins, pitched a remarkable game with the exception<br />\nof two innings, the seventh, when<br />\nHaverford'scored twice, and the<br />\nninth, when the Pennsylvanians<br />\nadded three runs, making their<br />\ntotal five runs for the day. Up<br />\nuntil the seventh inning the Haverford batsmen had only solved his<br />\ndelivery for one bingle, a single<br />\nof the flukiest variety, which<br />\nGreenbaum should have gotten<br />\neasily if he had not been playing<br />\ntoo deep in his field. Welliver's<br />\ncontrol was also very good up until the ninth, when he hit three of<br />\nthe Haverford batters, but he came<br />\ndown to earth after three counters<br />\nhad crossed the plate.<br />\n\u2022 Benson, the first man up for<br />\nHopkins in the initial period was<br />\ngiven a base on balls, and Littman and Cox also were given free<br />\ntransportation, filling the bases.<br />\nWebb, batting in the clean-up position, clouted out his first single<br />\nof the game and Benson and Littman crossed the plate. Bloomsburg also singled, scoring Cox, and<br />\nJones was hit by a pitched ball.<br />\nSickle fanned, and Greenbaum<br />\nlined out another bingle, scoring<br />\nWebb and Bloomsburg. Welliver<br />\nhit a sharp grounder to the pitcher and was thrown out at first,<br />\nand Benson, at bat for his second<br />\ntime in the inning, ended the<br />\nstanza with a pop fly to the second<br />\nbaseman.<br />\nIn the third period two more<br />\nruns were gotten by Hopkins.<br />\nJones opened the inning with a<br />\nhome run to deep left field, a line<br />\ndrive right along the foul line.<br />\nSickle was out on a grounder and<br />\nGreenbaum got his second hit of<br />\nthe game. Welliver sacrificed him<br />\nto second, and Benson brought<br />\nhim home with a two-base drive.<br />\nLittman made the third out by<br />\nwhiffing the air. Three more runs<br />\nwere scored in the next inning,<br />\nand Hopkins got their last run of<br />\nthe game in the seventh.<br />\n'Haverford was very weak at the<br />\nbat until the seventh, being unable<br />\nto solve Welliver's delivery. Even<br />\nin the seventh they only got one<br />\nsingle, the two runs being largely<br />\ndue to an error by Jones. In the<br />\nninth they got three more runs,<br />\ndue to three singles, three hit batters and two errors.<br />\nSickle who played first base for<br />\nthe first<br />\n'time in his life, put up<br />\na remarkably good game, and in<br />\nall probability will be kept there<br />\nfor a time at least. He handled<br />\nseveral flies in good style in addition to fielding three grounders<br />\ncleanly and taking many difficult<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nthe field.. But within the first ten<br />\nminutes Hopkins got together,<br />\nworked the ball well down on the<br />\nattack, and Defandorf shot a<br />\ngoal. Swarthmore played mostly<br />\non the defensive for the rest of the<br />\nhalf, but Baxley shot a goal when<br />\ntime was about half up and repeated it about five minutes later.<br />\nSwarthmore came back with a bit<br />\nof \"pep\" at the beginning of the<br />\nsecond half, but the Black and<br />\nBlue teamwork was too much for<br />\nthem, and Silberstein netted two<br />\nbeautiful goals early in the period.<br />\nDuring the last part of the second<br />\nhalf, Coach Wolfe sent in many<br />\nsubstitutes, giving every member<br />\nof the first-string squad a chance.<br />\nThe new men did very well, and<br />\nheld off Swarthmore's final efforts<br />\nof fight in great style.<br />\nIt was the last game at Hopkins for 011ie Winslow, who leaves<br />\nthis Monday for the Officers'<br />\nTraining Camp of the Signal<br />\nCorps at College Park.

He had a clean day in the<br />\nfield and got two hits, one a<br />\ndouble, out of four trips to the<br />\nplate. For the first time in many<br />\nyears, Hopkins was represented<br />\non the field by an entirely undergraduate team and they played together in fine style. Jack Jones,<br />\nplaying his first game for Hopkins<br />\nat the hot corner, made two errors, but the field was wet and the<br />\nball was slippery, so these cannot<br />\nbe wholly blamed on him.

The<br />\nmen have shown up remarkably<br />\nwell lately, both at practice and<br />\nin the games, and have considerably improved their weakness at<br />\nthe bat that was so manifest in<br />\nthe Western Maryland game.<br />\nEvery man on the team has been<br />\nhitting the ball hard and the Navy<br />\ntwirlers are scheduled for some<br />\nrough treatment. The lineup of<br />\nthe Hopkins aggregation will not<br />\nbe changed with the exception of<br />\nthe shifting of \"Doc\" Cox to the<br />\noutfield, where he played for two<br />\nyears at City College, and the stationing of J. Jones at the hot corner, due to the fact that Rogers,<br />\nwho was scheduled to take care<br />\nof the third sack, has been called<br />\ninto military 'service. Cox is expected to benefit very much by<br />\nthe change, as \"Doc\" is not used<br />\nto playing the infield, while he is<br />\nperfectly at home in the outer garden. Jones, on the contrary, is a<br />\nnatural infielaer and is expected<br />\nto show up very well at the third<br />\nstation.<br />\nWelliver will probably be selected to start the game again against<br />\nthe Annapolitans, but no definite<br />\ndecision has yet been reached by<br />\nCoach Hooper, and at the last<br />\nminute either Love or Judefind<br />\nmay be selected to serve up the<br />\nshoots.

We cannot say that our dollars are more precious than our boys. We must show the<br />\nworld that the farm dollar is a fighter. We cannot offer our flesh and blood<br />\nto The Wolves of the World, and yet keep your money hidden in the ground.<br />\nOf all farmers on earth, the French farmer is most respected, and has<br />\nthe best chance in the market. That is because the French farmers saved<br />\nFrance. At the end of the Prussian War, Bismarck demanded a ransom<br />\nwhich he thought France never could pay. The bankers and large moneyed<br />\nmen would not have taken that debt, but Bismarck did not know the soul of<br />\nthe French farmers. They brought out their last dollar and laid it upon the<br />\naltar of their country. France has never forgotten, and her farmers dominate<br />\nthe Nation.<br />\nWhoever finances America in this War will rule America for the next<br />\nquarter century. Every farm dollar invested in Liberty Bonds is a nail in<br />\nthe coffin of German autocracy, and brings the world a step nearer pure democracy, by making our farmers, as they should be, the financial creditors<br />\nof this country.<br />\nAs an investment, the Liberty Bond is the surest thing on earth. Every<br />\ndollar of the Nation's, more than 125 billions of wealth, is pledged to redeem<br />\nyour bond. After the Civil War there were times when the railroad bond,<br />\nthe bank stock, and other securities were in danger, but the Government<br />\nbond always stood, as it always will, like the shadow of a rock in a weary<br />\nland.<br />\nMake the future of your wife and children as \"safe as a Government<br />\nBond.\" Protect their future with your money.

The first question decided<br />\nwas that of the next meeting,<br />\nwhich will be held on Saturday,<br />\nApril 27, at 2 P. M.<br />\nThe first speaker on the schedule was Mr. Zahn \u2022 his subject was<br />\n\"Logarithms.\" He began with a<br />\nbrief history of logarithms. Logarithms were invented by Napier in<br />\n1614; these, however, were very<br />\ndifferent from those we today<br />\ncall \"Naperian Logarithms.\" They<br />\nmade important use of \"ten to the<br />\nseventh power,\" and their base<br />\nwas approximately the reciprocal<br />\nof e. The tables as we now have<br />\nthem were invented by Briggs and<br />\ndeveloped by Vlacq. The speaker<br />\nthen demonstrated the method of<br />\nderiving logarithms with the calculus by use of Taylor's theorem.<br />\nThe resulting series was used for<br />\nthe first few numbers; afterwards<br />\nsubstitutions were made in the<br />\nvariable to make the converging of<br />\nthe series more rapid. With one<br />\nof these substitutions only one<br />\nterm of the series was necessary,<br />\nand with a second none was needed, making the calculation only<br />\nan adding of certain quantities already obtained. The logarithms<br />\nthus obtained were changed to the<br />\nbase ten by a simple theorem of<br />\nalgebra. Mr. Zahn then showed<br />\nan approximate method of continuous fractions. Dr. Hulburt then<br />\nclosed the discussion with a little<br />\nmore of the history, stating that<br />\nthe aim of the early mathematicians was to obtain a high degree<br />\nof accuracy by taking a number<br />\nof additional decimal places. This<br />\nresulted in making the tables so<br />\nlarge that they filled large sets of<br />\nheavy volumes.<br />\nMr. Breit then demonstrated<br />\nsome original solutions to some<br />\nSENIORS LOSE CLASS PRESIDENT<br />\nproblems. In the first he solved a<br />\npair of simultaneous equations of<br />\n(Continuedfrom page 1)<br />\nthe second and third degree by<br />\nproving that the first was a pair<br />\nwhich corps he held a commission. of<br />\nstraight lines.

It represents the tribute, in terms of flesh and blood, of a<br />\nhumanitarian institution, which has already paid a great tribute in<br />\nresearch and knowledge, to mankind.<br />\nBut if the service flag is merely to symbolize and immortalize the<br />\nservice of Hopkins' sons, it will not serve its entire purpose. A strip<br />\nof bunting is a poor substitute for<br />\n* mowumentura aere perennius<br />\n*<br />\n\u2022<br />\nregalique situ pyramidium altius,<br />\nquod non imber edax, non Aquilo itnpotens<br />\npossit diruere ant innumerabilis<br />\nannorum series et fuga temporum<br />\n(which means, if our scant memory of Latin does not betray us) \"a monument more enduring than bronze, more sublime than<br />\nthe crumbling mangnificence of kings one that neither the eroding<br />\nrain nor the furious northwind, nor the countless succession of years,<br />\nnor the swift course of time shall be able to destroy.\" The real purpose of the service flag is to inspire those of us who are still at college with the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice that enkindled<br />\nthe hearts of the men represented by blue or gold stars.<br />\nIt is not for us to absorb ourselves with poetic speculations as<br />\nto the number of additional blue stars that will appear, or as to the<br />\nnumber of blue stars that will turn to gold. Let us leave that to<br />\nromantic old ladies. It is for us to discover how we, as college students, can best serve in this national emergency. It is for us who day<br />\nafter day walk\u2014on our way to or from classes\u2014under the flag to translate that symbol of service into our hearts, our words, our deeds.<br />\nWe have been continuing our courses at college because we have<br />\nbeen told that we can best serve our country in that way. It is important to observe that what are often matters of individual welfare<br />\nin times of peace become in times of war patriotic and fundamental<br />\nduties. Some examples, from the standpoint of the college student,<br />\nare: to study, to keep physically fit, to undergo military training, and,<br />\nfinally, to economize. While war is essentially a test of physical<br />\nprowess and endurance, it does not eliminate, but rather accentuates,<br />\nthe need for trained minds; intelligence is needed to direct, control<br />\nand distribute physical force. A new seriousness and earnestness,<br />\nthen, should mark our attitude towards our college courses. We must<br />\nhave undergone a most complete and radical revolution; we should aim<br />\nto learn as much instead of as little as possible; we should take a personal, aggressive, rather than an impersonal, passive, interest in our<br />\nwork.<br />\nWe must look forward to the days beyond the war\u2014the critical<br />\ndays of reconstruction\u2014when the insistent demand for trained intellects will ring throughout our country, throughout the civilized, unkulturized world. In the industrial world there will be an urgent demand for organizers in the educational world there will be a no less<br />\nteachers, in the political\u2014in the broad sense\u2014<br />\nurgent demand for'<br />\nworld there will be a most urgent demand for leaders. Who, if not<br />\nthe college-trained men, are to meet this demand?<br />\nIt is assumed, inasmuch as the end of the war (which will only<br />\ncome with an allied victory) is not yet in sight, that every noncripple in college is preparing himself for eventual service in the<br />\narmed forces of his country. It he is not now physically fit, he is<br />\ngiven through the medium of college athletics every opportunity in<br /><br />\nOne of the most promising features of undergraduate activities<br />\nthis year was the spirit evinced by the members of the Battalion before and during the inspection last week. It was an inspiration to<br />\nnote especially in what a whole-hearted way the members of the Battalion responded to the request of Major Guild to drill -an extra half<br />\nhour on Monday. It showed that we had developed a real esprit de<br />\ncorps, real Hopkins spirit, and real respect for our Commandant.<br />\nBut, on Saturday afternoon when the Hopkins baseball and lacrosse teams staged a double victory, after playing in the cold and<br />\nrain on a slippery and soggy field, there was not a handful of Hopkins men to celebrate it. The spirit which was so rampant in the<br />\nearly part of the week had completely melted away in the showers<br />\nof Saturday. If the lacrosse and ball teams could play in that weather,<br />\nthe rest of the student body could certainly have braved an April<br />\nshower to watch and encourage them. Is Hopkins spirit so transient<br />\nthat it cannot be sustained through one, week; so unstable and fragile<br />\nthat it cannot weather a shower?<br /><br />\nMore Facts.<br />\nIn the morning papers of last Saturday, there was a notice that<br />\nthe Hopkins tennis team would play City College\u2014a local high school.<br />\nTo the best of our knowledge, there were five Hopkins men who knew<br />\nanything whatsoever about the match; they were the self-appointed<br />\nmanager and four men whom he selected by telephone\u2014and by nothing<br />\nelse\u2014to represent Hopkins. The tennis team receives an annual appropriation of approximately $50.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that on the two teams that scored a double<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022victory at Homewood on Saturday there was not a single graduate<br />\nstudent.<br /><br />\nOliver P.

By doing what is<br />\ncalled \"the fabrication of parts,\"<br />\naway from the yard, the time of<br />\ndelivery of large numbers of ships<br />\ncan be greatly shortened as compared with ordinary shipyard<br />\npractice; and further, it would<br />\nhave been impossible for any existing yard to have extended its<br />\nfacilities so as to make them adequate for carying out any such<br />\nprogram as that undertaken at<br />\nHog Island. It was necessary to<br />\nmake use of practically all the<br />\nfacilities of the United States<br />\nand some in Canada in order to<br />\nget the material for the ships.<br />\nThis has made a tremendous organization necessary and involves<br />\nan extensive system for supplying<br />\ndetailed information to manufacturers and for inspecting and expediting the product. The work<br />\nhas been so carefully planned,<br />\nhowever by the American International<br />\n' Shipbuilding Corporation that the steel already received at the shipyard is fitting<br />\ntogether in the most satisfactory<br />\nmanner, and the precautions<br />\ntaken indicate that all parts of<br />\nthe ships will be assembled in<br />\nmuch quicker time than would<br />\nhave been the case had any excepting a large and experienced<br />\norganization taken hold of the<br />\nproject.<br />\nThe following figures are taken<br />\nfrom a paper written by Mr.<br />\nGeorge J.

Up<br />\nuntil the seventh inning the Haverford batsmen had only solved his<br />\ndelivery for one bingle, a single<br />\nof the flukiest variety, which<br />\nGreenbaum should have gotten<br />\neasily if he had not been playing<br />\ntoo deep in his field.

Welliver sacrificed him<br />\nto second, and Benson brought<br />\nhim home with a two-base drive.<br />\nLittman made the third out by<br />\nwhiffing the air. Three more runs<br />\nwere scored in the next inning,<br />\nand Hopkins got their last run of<br />\nthe game in the seventh.<br />\n'Haverford was very weak at the<br />\nbat until the seventh, being unable<br />\nto solve Welliver's delivery. Even<br />\nin the seventh they only got one<br />\nsingle, the two runs being largely<br />\ndue to an error by Jones. In the<br />\nninth they got three more runs,<br />\ndue to three singles, three hit batters and two errors.<br />\nSickle who played first base for<br />\nthe first<br />\n'time in his life, put up<br />\na remarkably good game, and in<br />\nall probability will be kept there<br />\nfor a time at least. He handled<br />\nseveral flies in good style in addition to fielding three grounders<br />\ncleanly and taking many difficult<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nthe field.. But within the first ten<br />\nminutes Hopkins got together,<br />\nworked the ball well down on the<br />\nattack, and Defandorf shot a<br />\ngoal. Swarthmore played mostly<br />\non the defensive for the rest of the<br />\nhalf, but Baxley shot a goal when<br />\ntime was about half up and repeated it about five minutes later.<br />\nSwarthmore came back with a bit<br />\nof \"pep\" at the beginning of the<br />\nsecond half, but the Black and<br />\nBlue teamwork was too much for<br />\nthem, and Silberstein netted two<br />\nbeautiful goals early in the period.<br />\nDuring the last part of the second<br />\nhalf, Coach Wolfe sent in many<br />\nsubstitutes, giving every member<br />\nof the first-string squad a chance.<br />\nThe new men did very well, and<br />\nheld off Swarthmore's final efforts<br />\nof fight in great style.<br />\nIt was the last game at Hopkins for 011ie Winslow, who leaves<br />\nthis Monday for the Officers'<br />\nTraining Camp of the Signal<br />\nCorps at College Park.

For the first time in many<br />\nyears, Hopkins was represented<br />\non the field by an entirely undergraduate team and they played together in fine style.

Cox is expected to benefit very much by<br />\nthe change, as \"Doc\" is not used<br />\nto playing the infield, while he is<br />\nperfectly at home in the outer garden.

The first question decided<br />\nwas that of the next meeting,<br />\nwhich will be held on Saturday,<br />\nApril 27, at 2 P. M.<br />\nThe first speaker on the schedule was Mr. Zahn \u2022 his subject was<br />\n\"Logarithms.\" He began with a<br />\nbrief history of logarithms. Logarithms were invented by Napier in<br />\n1614; these, however, were very<br />\ndifferent from those we today<br />\ncall \"Naperian Logarithms.\" They<br />\nmade important use of \"ten to the<br />\nseventh power,\" and their base<br />\nwas approximately the reciprocal<br />\nof e. The tables as we now have<br />\nthem were invented by Briggs and<br />\ndeveloped by Vlacq. The speaker<br />\nthen demonstrated the method of<br />\nderiving logarithms with the calculus by use of Taylor's theorem.<br />\nThe resulting series was used for<br />\nthe first few numbers; afterwards<br />\nsubstitutions were made in the<br />\nvariable to make the converging of<br />\nthe series more rapid. With one<br />\nof these substitutions only one<br />\nterm of the series was necessary,<br />\nand with a second none was needed, making the calculation only<br />\nan adding of certain quantities already obtained. The logarithms<br />\nthus obtained were changed to the<br />\nbase ten by a simple theorem of<br />\nalgebra. Mr. Zahn then showed<br />\nan approximate method of continuous fractions. Dr. Hulburt then<br />\nclosed the discussion with a little<br />\nmore of the history, stating that<br />\nthe aim of the early mathematicians was to obtain a high degree<br />\nof accuracy by taking a number<br />\nof additional decimal places. This<br />\nresulted in making the tables so<br />\nlarge that they filled large sets of<br />\nheavy volumes.<br />\nMr. Breit then demonstrated<br />\nsome original solutions to some<br />\nSENIORS LOSE CLASS PRESIDENT<br />\nproblems. In the first he solved a<br />\npair of simultaneous equations of<br />\n(Continuedfrom page 1)<br />\nthe second and third degree by<br />\nproving that the first was a pair<br />\nwhich corps he held a commission. of<br />\nstraight lines.

Rabbi Heller delivered<br />\nan inspiring speech and made an<br />\nimpassioned plea for Jewish unity<br />\nand group consciousness. He<br />\npointed oat that one of the mistakes of the Zionist organization<br />\nhas been that from its very beginning it has not made sufficient effort to convert those who have<br />\nnot yet felt the call to Zion. He<br />\nsaid in part: \"The rearousing of<br />\nJewish unity is our task * * *<br />\nand before the time comes for<br />\nsending our pioneers to foreign<br />\nshores, there must be a spiritual<br />\nawakening and a feeling of national unity among the Jews in<br />\nexile.\"<br />\nThe possible value of a Jewish<br />\nState cannot be overestimated.<br />\nWe need an intermediary between<br />\nthe East and the West, and the<br />\nJew alone, with his apparently in-<br /><br />\nwn<br /><br />\nMEN'S AND YOUNG<br />\nMEN'S CLOTHING<br />\nAND FURNISHINGS<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\niS A Sn<br /><br />\nThe<br />\nNorman Remington Co.<br /><br />\nReady for Spring<br />\n\"rtrirtu\"<br />\nVrattb<br />\neutlyz<br /><br />\nDe low hub<br />\nBaltimore, Charles<br />\nand Fayette<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 37365, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "51323b79-6883-40e7-a9e5-09edfb6af08c", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/12872-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 12872, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "4142fb25-fb0e-4c5d-a0d3-c492c09cf8e4", "url": "/node/12872"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "9f5c3ccc-e496-4491-b40b-ba563fd7f4da"}]}
