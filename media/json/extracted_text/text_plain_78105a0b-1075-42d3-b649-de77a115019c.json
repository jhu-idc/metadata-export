However, \"there is no<br />\nconsensus that divestment will in<br />\nfact have any positive impact on<br />\nthe eradication of apartheid.\"<br />\nHe added, \"A judgment that<br />\nthe simple and unexamined<br />\npresence of corporate operations<br />\nin South Africa is self-evident<br />\njustification for terminating<br />\nUniversity ownership of corporate stock at this time is not a<br />\nresponsible conclusion. Wholesale divestment of stocks of a<br />\nlarge number of corporations, including some of the most consistently successful American<br />\n<br />\nbusiness enterprises, and amounting in aggregate to a significant<br />\nfraction of the University's total<br />\ninvestments, would severely<br />\ncompromise the successful directives to professional managers to<br />\nmost effectively invest University funds.\"<br />\nThe Board's decision comes in<br />\nthe wake of announcements by<br />\nGeneral Motors and IBM that<br />\nthey would sell their South<br />\nAfrican operations. These moves<br />\nreduced the University's South<br />\nAfrica-related portfolio value by<br />\nsome $15 million, to about $65<br />\nmillion, according to Bond.<br />\nHowever, in addition to fears<br />\nthat total divestment would<br />\npossibly threaten the University's<br />\nsolvency, the Trustees based the<br />\nnew policy on what they called<br />\n\"fundamental principles of the<br />\nnature and operation of the<br />\nUniversity.\" Radcliffe stated,<br />\n\"As a community of scholarship<br />\n<br />\ncommitted to teaching, research<br />\nand public service, the University. . . must refrain from institutional commitment to a political<br />\nposition so as to preserve in full<br />\nthe freedom of expression and inquiry essential to its mission,<br />\ncharacter and integrity.\"<br />\nHe continued however, \"The<br />\nUniversity is a corporate citizen<br />\nwithin society and as such cannot<br />\nbe indifferent to manifest social<br />\nevil or injustice.\"<br />\nCoalition member Paul Genest<br />\ncalled the decision \"a day of<br />\nshame and sorrow.

Iran has come to represent, in popular and not-sopopular culture, a proto-typical<br />\nIslamic state.\"<br />\nHe referred to Iran's recent<br />\nhistory as that of a \"hijacked<br />\nrevolution,\" in which clerics<br />\nseized what was not rightfully<br />\ntheirs from a coalition of forces<br />\nseeking to overthrow the Shah.<br />\nToday Americans view Iran as<br />\na nation governed by fanatics, but<br />\nBakhash sought to examine the<br />\nforces that brought the Ayatollah<br />\nto power. \"On the surface, Iran<br />\nwas rapidly modernizing and industrializing. This led to a<br />\nsecularization and a secular<br />\ngovernment which was ultimately viewed by the people as<br />\nillegitimate.<br />\n\"Islamic identity was threatened by Western industrialization.<br />\nIn times of stress and strain people turn back to their tradition,\"<br />\nBakhash added. He cited the increase in religious book sales and<br />\na proliferation of informal religious discussion groups as signs of<br />\na strengthened religious element<br />\nunder the Shah.<br />\n\"Religious elements were to a<br />\nlarge degree independent from<br />\nthe state in the financial sphere<br />\nand were able to define the aims<br />\nof the revolution,\" he continued.<br />\n\"Islam itself offers a rich<br />\n<br />\nvocabulary for articulation of<br />\nsuch opposition,\" Bakhash claimed. Noting the martyrdoms of<br />\nearly Islam, which are frequently acted out in passion plays,<br />\nBakhash explained that such martyrdoms began to be interpreted<br />\nas not only feats of courage, but<br />\nalso of justice.<br />\nReferring to a scene in John<br />\nUpdike's novel Roger's Version,<br />\nhe explained that evil or \"the<br />\ndevil is not doubt, but rather<br />\nabsence of doubt. It is the absence<br />\nof doubt that pushes people into<br />\nsuicide bombings and death<br />\ncamps.\"<br />\nOf the present government<br />\nBakhash commented, \"In theory<br />\nat least, it is a theocracy. A<br />\nmassive shift has occurred since<br />\nthe revolution in the locus of<br />\npower. All laws must conform<br />\nwith Islamic law and clergy hold<br />\nall major offices of the state.\"<br />\nPerri concentrated his remarks<br />\non the Zionist movement in Israel<br />\nas another predominant example<br />\nof religious extremism in the<br />\nMiddle East. \"As a result of the<br />\n1967 Six-Day War, fundamentalism erupted into a full-fledged<br />\nmovement in Israel,\" he said.<br />\n\"That movement [of the New<br />\nZionist Fundamentalists] is the<br />\nalter ego of the Israeli society. By<br />\nunderstanding fundamentalism,<br />\nwe can better understand Israel,\"<br />\nhe explained.<br />\n\"The Zionist movement has<br />\nbeen very different from those<br />\nfundamentalist movements in the<br />\nArab world,\" Perri said. \"The<br />\nreasons are very unique: There<br />\nare renewed encounters of young<br />\nIsraelis with their biblical<br />\nheritage. They live and go to<br />\nplaces in the Holy Land where<br />\ntheir forefathers were.<br />\n\"The Jews lived for almost<br />\n2000 years in a religious way of<br />\nlife,\" he added. \"Jewish<br />\nsecularism is a new phenomenon.<br />\nSecular Jews are faced with a<br />\nproblem of identity. The definition of their identity that they<br />\nchose was nationalism. Zionism<br />\nwas their Jewish nationalism.\"<br />\nThis rise of secular nationalism<br />\nled to powerful tensions in the<br />\nJewish community, declared<br />\nPerri. \"Religious leaders were<br />\nvery much against Zionism,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Perri, Zionist<br />\nfundamentalism became contrasted with and then incorporated<br />\ninto the Messianic concept. \"Messianism has been interpreted and<br />\nreinterpreted,\" he explained.<br />\nSince the second century<br />\nrebellions against the Romans,<br />\nthere has been a dispersion of the<br />\nJewish people. \"Active rebellion,<br />\nthat is, 'mounting the ramparts,'<br />\nis forbidden. [Messianism dictates that] you are to sit there and<br />\nbe a good Jew and wait for the<br />\nMessiah. In these terms the<br />\npolitical means of the Zionists<br />\nlooked horrible to traditional<br />\nJewish leaders.\"<br />\nThus a \"religious Zionism\"<br />\nevolved which Perri called \"a<br />\npractical, pragmatic approach to<br />\nthe Messianic concept. It said that<br />\nwe are near the Messianic era and<br />\nthat Jerusalem must therefore be<br />\nunder Israeli control. The Jews<br />\nalso can't be dispersed.\"<br />\nHe added,\"We are entering an<br />\nera where absolute sanctity rules<br />\nover corporeal reality. Return of<br />\none inch of territory [that was<br />\ncaptured in the Six-Day War]<br />\nwould be giving in to 'negative<br />\nmystical' forces.<br />\n\"The modern secular world is<br />\nseen as struggling for survival.<br />\nThe Yom Kippur War was a struggle against Western civilization,<br />\nwhich is the most common denominator in Jewish fundamentalism.\" Perri continued, \"The<br />\nland of Israel is sacred....Historical symbols have been<br />\ntransformed into holiness. The<br />\nconcept of sanctity has been applied to place.\"<br />\nPerri expressed his opinion that<br />\npolitical conflicts, especially<br />\nthose concerning Israeli occupied<br />\nterritory, show no signs of being<br />\nsolved soon. Under Zionist concepts, \"there cannot possibly be<br />\na place for Gentiles here [in<br />\nIsrael]. They work against this<br />\nsanctity...and this leaves no room<br />\nfor tolerance.\"<br />\nYet Perri emphasized that the<br />\nZionists made up only a small<br />\nminority in the Israeli political<br />\nscene. \"Their political aims of<br />\nannexation of the West Bank is<br />\ncommon to other factions, so<br />\nZionists still have support in the<br />\nKenesset.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\nIllegal Immigrants Seeking<br />\nSanctuary Examined at MSE<br />\nby Tom McNamara<br />\nOn the night of Monday, October 27, a lecture entitled<br />\n\"Liberation Theology and the<br />\nSanctuary Movement in North<br />\nAmerica\" was given by Phil<br />\nWheaton of the Ecumenical Program for InterAmerican Communication and Action. The lecture was a part of the 1986 Milton<br />\nS. Eisenhower Symposium<br />\nseries.<br />\nThe presentation centered on<br />\nthe relatively recent actions of<br />\nchurches in the United States in<br />\nhelping refugees from Central<br />\nAmerican nations who are classed<br />\nas illegal immigrants in this<br />\ncountry.<br />\nWheaton said that there were<br />\ntwo primary, interrelated reasons<br />\nfor the decision of many religious<br />\nleaders to help these refugees.<br />\nThe first was that these leaders<br />\nhad heard of the \"bloodlettings\"<br />\nin nations such as El Salvador and<br />\nGuatemala directly from people<br />\nwho had escaped from these nations. These stories were not the<br />\nsame as those available from the<br />\npress in this country, Wheaton<br />\nsaid; the actual situation was<br />\n<br />\nworse than it had appeared.<br />\nThe second reason he gave was<br />\nthat many of the refugees claimed U.S. complicity in the practices of Central American dictatorships which the United States<br />\nsupports. He said that when the<br />\nAmericans involved in the sanctuary movement began to wonder<br />\nwhy the government was deporting those who had fled to this<br />\ncountry, these people claimed<br />\nthat it was because the United<br />\nStates was allied with the countries they were fleeing.<br />\nWheaton called the present<br />\nsanctuary movement among<br />\nmany different faiths \"a joint<br />\nministry of risk-taking.\" He<br />\nstressed that the churches had<br />\ndecided \"to side with the victims\" in the attempts of people<br />\nfrom Latin America to escape oppressive regimes, helping<br />\nrefugees with legal and other aid.<br />\nHe said that faced with \"an empire' \u2014a term Wheaton applies to<br />\nthe United States government\u2014<br />\nthe religious leaders had felt that<br />\nthe only way they could act was<br />\nby \"taking these people into their<br />\nlives.\" He tried to stress a difference between the actions of the<br />\n<br />\ngovernment of this country and 'of<br />\nits people.<br />\nAnother facet of \"Liberation<br />\nTheology\" which Wheaton<br />\npresented was that in the last few<br />\ndecades, the Catholic Church's<br />\n\"historical alignment has changed 180 degrees [in Central<br />\nAmerica], from the rich to the<br />\npoor.\" He said that small<br />\nreligious groups in Central<br />\nAmerica began to help people<br />\nthere to lose their \"fatalism,\"<br />\nand to see themselves as capable<br />\nof action, not merely as victims<br />\nof suffering. \"In my view, this is<br />\nthe most important thing to happen in Latin America in the last<br />\n400 years,\" he said.<br />\nHe explained that \"Liberation<br />\nTheology,\" theology concerned<br />\nwith helping the oppressed, has<br />\nchanged in recent years. \"Captivity represents the primary context within which we have to<br />\nwork,\" Wheaton said, comparing<br />\nthe plight of citizens of these<br />\ncountries to the \"Hebrew captivity in Egypt.\" He said that<br />\ntheology in Latin America often<br />\nused the exodus from Egypt as a<br />\n\"focal point,\" and claimed that<br />\nthis was the reason.<br />\n<br />\nGenetic Testing for Disease<br />\nRaises Ethical Implications<br />\nby Geir Magnusson<br />\n<br />\nthis technology becomes more accurate and advanced, Holtzman<br />\npredicts that \"the technology can<br />\nbe used to avoid conception\"<br />\nthrough alerting the parents,<br />\n\"and can be used during pregnancy to avoid birth\" through his<br />\ndiagnosis of disease in the fetus.<br />\nHoltzman also spoke about the<br />\ncommercial interest in genetic<br />\nforecasting. \"There are twenty<br />\ncompanies devoting fair amounts<br />\nof capital to find genetic-oriented<br />\ndiseases,\" he said, \"and many<br />\ncompanies are devoting efforts to<br />\nsimplify the technology.\"<br />\n<br />\nHoltzman emphasized that the<br />\ntests will be available before there<br />\nare effective treatments.<br />\nEmployers are also interested<br />\nin genetic forecasting, because of<br />\nits possibilities in reducing group<br />\ninsurance premiums. Because<br />\ngroup insurance premiums are<br />\nbased on the past health record of<br />\nthat group, employers with a way<br />\nof identifying high risk individuals (those with predisposition to disease) could possibly<br />\nbring down their health care<br />\npremiums by excluding those individuals from employment.<br />\n<br />\nLecturing on forecasting<br />\ndisease through genetic testing,<br />\nand its ethical implications, Neil<br />\nHoltzman spoke at The Office of<br />\nthe Chaplain's \"Sunday Experience.\" Holtzman spoke to an<br />\naudience composed of one<br />\nundergraduate, a few graduate<br />\nstudents, and a flock of senior<br />\ncitizens.<br />\nHoltzman, a senior analyst in<br />\nthe Office of Technology Assessment of Congress with joint appointments in Pediatrics and<br />\nEpidemiology at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical Institutions,<br />\nspoke about testing techniques<br />\nand how they can be used.<br />\nGenetic testing to forecast<br />\ndisease uses techniques that map<br />\nindividual genes in DNA that are<br />\n\"We are a religious people whose<br />\nContinued from Page 1<br />\nsuspected of causing diseases,<br />\ninstitutions presuppose a Supreme<br />\nHunanemia,<br />\nsickle<br />\ncell<br />\nsuch as<br />\ntington's Disease, and cystic tist churches and disrupted ser- Being.\"<br />\nRobertson then declared, \"The<br />\nfibrosis.

This was<br />\nthe second of two forums sponsored by the Student Activities<br />\nOffice and the Chaplain's Office<br />\none week prior to the Trustees'<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nThe panel of speakers included two professors, - Peter<br />\nNewman, of the Political<br />\nEconomy Department, and David<br />\nCohen of the History and Anthropology Department, and also<br />\ntwo student representatives, Paul<br />\nGenest of the Coalition and Kris<br />\nMauren.<br />\nThe two student speakers clearly expressed views representing<br />\nthe extremes of both camps,<br />\nwhile neither of the professors<br />\nseemed as adamant about the actual divestment issue. \"I don't<br />\ncare whether Hopkins divests,\"<br />\ncommented Newman.<br />\nProfessor Newman was the<br />\nfirst panelist to speak, and focused on the financial implications of<br />\ndivestment. He began by questioning, \"How can apartheid be<br />\neliminated? And what can the<br />\nUniversity do?\" Newman stated<br />\nthat this issue was a \"matter of<br />\ngovernmental policy,\" and \"required a strong stance by the<br />\ngovernment....The failure of the<br />\nReagan administration to do so is<br />\ndeplorable.\"<br />\nTo answer the question concerning the University's role,<br />\nNewman said that the options<br />\nwere, \"to divest holdings. and to<br />\nboycott goods and services of<br />\ncompanies operating in South<br />\nAfrica,\" Newman contended that<br />\nboycotting would have the,<br />\n\"most direct effect on profits of<br />\nthe companies involved.\"<br />\nNewman also made the distinction between divestment and<br />\ndisinvestment. \"Divestment is<br />\nthe selling of stocks in American<br />\ncompanies operating in South<br />\n<br />\nAfrica,\" said Newman, and<br />\ndisinvestment was the \"walking<br />\naway from projects and investments in South Africa by<br />\nU.S. companies...which usually<br />\nbenefit the local capitalists.\" The<br />\ndisinvestment of GM and IBM<br />\nwere cited as examples. Newman<br />\ncontends, however, that GM and<br />\nIBM were motivated to withdraw<br />\nfrom South Africa, \"due to a lack<br />\nof profits,\" and that any other<br />\nreason was secondary.<br />\nReflecting on recent events at<br />\nthe University, Newman<br />\nwondered, \"Why all the fuss?<br />\nWhy should protest go this<br />\nway?...Students should concentrate on the Reagan administration to change policy.\" He continued, it \"seems to me, that<br />\nstudents and faculty tend to<br />\nmediate social issues through the<br />\nUniversity,\" which he found<br />\n\"weird.\" Newman concluded<br />\nwith, \"It makes the University<br />\nmore important than we are.<br />\nWe're just academics\u2014not<br />\nmoral.\"<br />\n\"I consider actual divestment<br />\nminor in the agenda for ending<br />\napartheid in South Africa,\" said<br />\nCohen. However, he considered<br />\n<br />\ndivestment as an important statement by the University. In the<br />\nwords of Cohen, it would send,<br />\n\"an important message to groups<br />\nin exile or imprisoned in South<br />\nAfrica.\"<br />\nAccording to Cohen, a decision<br />\nto divest, \"would be less powerful\" and assertive because of<br />\nIBM's and GM's recent disinvestment.<br />\nOn Hopkins divesting, Genest<br />\nsaid, he hopes that after the IBM<br />\nand GM disinvestment, that this<br />\nwould be easier. \"They [the<br />\nTrustees] said, 'what can we do<br />\nwithout IBM in our portfilio, it's<br />\nour anchor?\" Now that IBM<br />\nin fact disinvested, this argument<br />\nis no longer valid.<br />\nThe final panelist was<br />\nMauren, also a student at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nAccording to Mauren, many do<br />\nnot understand the \"financial<br />\nramifications of divestment, and<br />\nthat it would leave Hopkins<br />\nvulnerable.\" Mauren questioned,<br />\n\"How can we condemn the same<br />\ncorporations that Hopkins so<br />\nheavily depends on for financial<br />\nsupport?\"<br />\n<br />\nCampus Crime Report<br />\n*The complainant reported that<br />\nabout 6:05 p.m. on October 26,<br />\nwhile he was walking in the<br />\n3000 block of N.

The peaceful expression of ideas<br />\nis essential to any free society and absolutely necessary for the health of institutions<br />\nof higher learning. Unfortunately, though,<br />\nthe Coalition's rally quickly broke down to<br />\na shocking display \u2022of immaturity and<br />\nugliness when the results of the vote on<br />\ndivestment were released.<br />\nBefore the decision of the Board to continue investing in some companies that do<br />\nbusiness in South Africa was announced,<br />\nCoalition members spread out on the floor<br />\nof Q-Level attempting to block and trip<br />\nTrustees as they prepared to leave the Garrett Room. During this time, members of<br />\nthe Coalition shouted ugly remarks.<br />\n<br />\nLater, during a conference with University President Steven Muller, Chairman of<br />\nthe Board of Trustees George Radcliffe and<br />\ngathered Trustees, Coalition members turned their backs on the speakers when they<br />\nattempted to defend the vote. Some Coalition members even began shouting \"Nazi!\"<br />\nand \"Racist!\" while Muller and Radcliffe<br />\nwere speaking.<br />\nThe entire spectacle was an embarrassment for all members of this community.<br />\nCivil protest\u2014especially provocative<br />\nprotest\u2014rightfully occupies an important<br />\nplace in the resolution of many conflicts,<br />\nbut lack of civility never does. True nonviolent civil protest is based on respect for<br />\none's adversaries, never contempt. In the<br />\nCoalition's displays of immaturity, they<br />\nsucceeded only in losing any moral<br />\nlegitimacy they may have had in conducting the demonstration.<br />\nThe wisdom of the Board's vote is still<br />\nopen to debate, of course. As always, we<br />\nmaintain that the University ought to fully<br />\ndivest. But after the pathetic displays of the<br />\nCoalition on Monday, it has become ever<br />\nmore difficult to take the Coalition seriously<br />\nas a representative of those who advocate<br />\ndivestment. On Monday, the Coalition succeeded only in bringing shame to their<br />\ncause and to the University.<br />\n<br />\nA Call Unheeded:<br />\nSecuring a New Van<br />\nThe southeast side of the campus is in a<br />\nstate of siege. In less than six days, there<br />\nhave been at least six reported muggings<br />\nin the vicinity of 30th and Charles. It's time<br />\nfor the University to take action.<br />\nWithin the last two years, the University has made giant strides in the direction<br />\nof improving Homew000d security. By installing security phones, leveling large<br />\nbushes near footpaths, and increasing foot<br />\npatrols, among other things, the University has done much for the safety of its<br />\nstudents and staff.<br />\nNevertheless, shortcomings remain. In<br />\nthe wake of this week's rash of violent<br />\ncrime, it's time for the University to grapple with those shortcomings seriously and<br />\ntake the steps necessary to remedy them.<br />\nRevamping the security escort van program would be an excellent start.<br />\nSix weeks ago, we addressed the issue<br />\nof Homewood's escort van program and<br />\nconcluded that the service needs to be expanded. Because the van has been running<br />\nat near-capacity, van drivers and dispatchers have begun more active enforcement<br />\nof a policy of transporting students only to<br />\nand from the M.S.E. Library. Yesterday,<br />\nMajor Robert Larkin of Homewood Security confirmed that the policy is still in effect and that there are no current plans to<br />\nexpand the van escort service anytime soon.<br />\n<br />\nThe failure of the University to revamp<br />\nthe escort service needs to be reversed immediately. First, van drivers should be<br />\nallowed\u2014even encouraged\u2014to transport<br />\nstudents to and from off-campus locations.<br />\nThe only effect of insisting that the van be<br />\nused for transportation to and from the<br />\nlibrary is to discourage students from<br />\ntraveling safely\u2014exactly what the service<br />\nshouldn't be doing.<br />\nSecondly, another van ought to be added to the escort program to handle the increasing demands for its services. The cost<br />\nof a new van is a small price to pay if it<br />\nprevents Hopkins students from being attacked and mugged.<br />\nThe University's responsibilities to its<br />\nstudents don't end at the curb of Charles<br />\nStreet. On the contrary, the University has<br />\nan obligation to do everything possible to<br />\nprotect its students both on and off-campus.<br />\nIf Hopkins can't provide living accomdations for its students on campus, it ought<br />\nto at least provide a safe means for students<br />\nto move about the University community.<br />\nThis week, the administration needs to<br />\nreassess its security precautions for students<br />\nliving off-campus. Making the expansion<br />\nof the security escort service a top priority<br />\nwould certainly be a step to help avert the<br />\nkind of violence we have seen in the<br />\nHomewood area all too frequently.<br />\n<br />\nbrutally<br />\nfrank<br />\nFreshmen can expect the dorms<br />\nto metamorphosize into a stiffing<br />\ntropical hell as soon as the cold<br />\nweather really sets in. If the past<br />\ntwo years are any indication, the<br />\ndormitories suffer from more<br />\nthan just cafeteria food. The<br />\nheating system outperforms the<br />\nwildest dreams of any coldblooded lizard. Areas which do<br />\nnot enjoy overheating simply<br />\nfreeze. Aside from opening a<br />\nwindow in the middle of January<br />\nand alternating between freezing<br />\nblasts of cold and unbearable<br />\nheat, there seems to be no method<br />\nfor controlling the terror.<br />\nBut for real fun in ventilation,<br />\nnothing beats the Hut during the<br />\nwinter. For a city with mild<br />\nwinters, a city which can actually be claimed by the South, the<br />\nHomewood campus must be the<br />\nonly place designed to withstand<br />\nanother Ice Age. The Gilman<br />\nseminar rooms on the third floor<br />\nhave been called \"sweat boxes,\"<br />\nand it takes the imagination of an<br />\nearthworm to understand why.<br />\nOther buildings experience wild<br />\nvariations of temperature undoubtedly conjured by an unhinged sense of the creative.<br />\nThis sort of problem should be<br />\neasy to eliminate. Yet the<br />\nnuisance of the environs rise from<br />\nlowly trivia by the strength of<br />\ntheir numbers to become a<br />\nburden. Is a comfortable physical<br />\nrealm too much to ask of a<br />\nprestigious University?<br />\nThe University-owned apartments are dirty and ugly. There<br />\nis nothing to redeem them except<br />\na prime location. The renovation<br />\nof the dorms has given the school<br />\nsome decent living quarters. But<br />\nfor all of the stylish furniture<br />\nfound in the AMR lounges, there<br />\nis still a paucity of basic equip-<br />\n<br />\nment. Some rooms boast tables<br />\nrumored to be as old as the school<br />\nitself: nice enough for historical<br />\nvalue, but a sad comment on the<br />\nphysical condition of the<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nAmong the other things needed but missing are mailboxes.<br />\nDonald Faust, Postmaster, explains that the Gilman mail room<br />\nprocessed six million pieces of<br />\nmail last year, yet is \"out of<br />\nspace. Eventually it will have to<br />\ngo to three students for each<br />\nbox.\" Expansion plans for the<br />\npost office and bank, into the adjacent seminar rooms, were considered and then \"squashed.\"<br />\nMatters of entertainment are<br />\nhandled no better. The Levering<br />\ngame room wouldn't even make<br />\na second-rate arcade. Then there<br />\nare the \"large\" issues such as<br />\nlack of space in the library. Frequently overlooked in this<br />\ncategory is building access for the<br />\nhandicapped. As a friend on crutches reports, \"handicapped access is pretty poor.\" The<br />\nelevators which exist are<br />\nphenomenally slow and the marble steps of the Gilman Easybank<br />\nentrance are worn beyond just<br />\nhaving character.<br />\nCrossing Charles Street to<br />\nreach the Museum end of campus<br />\nis always a dangerous exercise.<br />\nNot only is there that rare car<br />\ncoming down Charles in the<br />\nsometimes-open wrong-way lane,<br />\nbut there are also plenty of impatient drivers poised at the Art<br />\nMuseum Drive intersection.<br />\nWhile this real-life video of<br />\nBaltimore traffic is not the Univsity's concern, it begins the day<br />\nfor many students and underscores the other nuisances well<br />\nwithin Hopkins' means to take<br />\ncare of.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nTimothy McNamara<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nA.J.

If<br />\neverybody has the right to express<br />\nhis or her opinion, everybody<br />\nshould also have the right to make<br />\nmistakes.<br />\nMy biggest concern, rather, is<br />\nabout the articles themselves and<br />\ntheir potentially dangerous and<br />\ndestructive impact on the social<br />\nfiber of a university which many<br />\nwant to consider a community.<br />\nIndeed, at no point does the<br />\nauthor clearly distance himself<br />\nfrom the two professors' study<br />\nand findings.On top of that, the<br />\ntitles are much too biased to leave<br />\nany doubt as to Gergyes' personal<br />\nopinion. These are obviously<br />\nmore than scientific reports: they<br />\nare openly racist statements.<br />\nI understand that the articles<br />\nsubmitted do not necessarily<br />\nreflect the views of the editorial<br />\nboard. Nevertheless, I would like<br />\nto suggest that, in the interest of<br />\nall here at Hopkins, the board of<br />\nthe News-Letter insists more on<br />\nquality and categorially dismisses<br />\npoor, low-level sensationalism<br />\neven disguised under the umbrella of science.<br />\nEric Tevoedjre<br />\n<br />\nAllergy to Plebiscites<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn wake of the Trustees' decision not to divest in full from<br />\ncompanies doing business with<br />\nSouth Africa, we hear the Coalition call for a \"binding\" referendum of all students and faculty<br />\nregarding the issue. Where does<br />\nthe Coalition find the gall to ask<br />\nfor such a \"binding\" plebiscite?<br />\nWhat gives the students the right<br />\nto play with funds that are not our<br />\nown? Our tuition barely pays for<br />\nten weeks of this institution's<br />\noperating budget.<br />\nSecondly, what makes the<br />\nCoalition believe that it is appropriate to set a precedent for<br />\nadministration by plebiscite?<br />\nWhatever the outcome of such a<br />\nreferendum, which I believe<br />\nwould support the Trustees, the<br />\ndamage done to the orderly and<br />\nrational administration of The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University would<br />\n<br />\nbe irreparable. After a binding<br />\nreferendum on the current issue,<br />\na not inconceivable progression<br />\nof matters to be decided in such<br />\na manner might include student<br />\nmanagement of the investment<br />\nportfolio, or perhaps even selection of administrative personnel<br />\nselection, from deans to secretaries. Is this a desirable state of<br />\naffairs? I think not.<br />\nI would like to close by quoting<br />\nMartin Peretz, Editor-in-Chief<br />\nand Chairman of The New<br />\nRepublic. In the 11-3-86 edition<br />\nof such magazine, Peretz, in<br />\nreference to referendums, say,<br />\n\"The Founding Fathers had a<br />\nhealthy allergy to plebiscitarian<br />\ndemocracy. . . The single-issue<br />\npassions provoked by referendums undermine representative<br />\ngovernment and civility in society as a whole.\" (p. 42)<br />\nPeretz Hirshbein<br />\n<br />\nShamed by Coalition<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nMonday's Trustees meeting was<br />\na success and a failure. The<br />\nUniversity and blacks in South<br />\nAfrica are better off, but the<br />\nstudents have been shamed by the<br />\nCoalition.<br />\nQuite simply, the Trustees did<br />\nwhat they should; they fulfilled<br />\ntheir fiduciary responsibility and<br />\nprotected the University endowment. Total divestment would<br />\ncost<br />\nHopkins<br />\nbetween<br />\n$1,000,000 and $1,500,000 in<br />\ntransaction costs alone. Divestment would also cost Hopkins<br />\ndearly in limiting the selection of<br />\nstocks for the endowment. Should<br />\nall Hopkins students be forced to<br />\npay for the whims of an annoying minority?<br />\nSouth African blacks also<br />\nbenefitted from Monday's<br />\nTrustees meeting was also a<br />\nblack leaders call for divestment,<br />\nthe majority of black South<br />\nAfricans oppose sanctions. The<br />\nreason why a disparity of opinion<br />\nexists is obvious. People like<br />\nBishop Tutu, whose children go<br />\nto school in the United States,<br />\nhave little to fear from increased<br />\nunemployment. The average<br />\nSouth African black knows that<br />\nhe or she has a responsibility to<br />\nhis or her family.<br />\nThe Coalition likes to remind<br />\nus that only one percent of black<br />\nSouth Africans work for U.S.<br />\ncompanies. Assuming that each<br />\nof these people has two or three<br />\nchildren, the number benefitting<br />\nfrom our presence quickly<br />\nbecomes three to four percent of<br />\nblack South Africans. (In real<br />\n<br />\nSpam on Wry<br />\nDear Doctor Wry,<br />\nI've got a problem. Every time<br />\nIgo to afraternity party, the same<br />\nthing happens.

Let us not be the<br />\nsadists that force them into that<br />\nposition!<br />\nIn addition to being a success,<br />\nThe Trustees meeting was also a<br />\nfailure\u2014not for what happened<br />\nduring it, but for what occurred<br />\nafter the proceedings had ended.<br />\nThe Coalition brought shame to<br />\nthis civilized institution by refusing to allow the Trustees to leave<br />\npeacefully, by saying the Trustees<br />\ndo not deserve courtesy, by sitting on the conference tables with<br />\ntheir backs to the Trustees while<br />\nChairman Radcliffe read the<br />\nUniversity's statement, and most<br />\noffensive of all, by calling the<br />\nTrustees racists. The Trustees of this University<br />\nselflessly and freely donate their<br />\ntime not to be harassed, but to ensure the suvivial and growth of<br />\nJohns Hopkins for the benefit of<br />\nall of us. I have heard many<br />\nstudents say that they were<br />\nashamed to be part of the University not because of the Trustees<br />\nbut because of the uncivilized<br />\nbehavior of the Coalition.<br />\nThe actions of the Coalition<br />\nbring me to a final point. It is<br />\nironic that they, a minor part of<br />\nthe Hopkins community, seek to<br />\nimpose their will on all members<br />\nof the University.

Are they willing to<br />\ngive up their tuition money and<br />\ngraduate stipends to feed the<br />\nblacks in South Africa that they<br />\nseek to unemploy? Of course not!<br />\nDivestment would be painless for<br />\nthem. They prefer to impose a<br />\nminority opinion on all of us by<br />\nannoytng everyone until it is<br />\nworth millions of dollars to shut<br />\nthem up. Their brand of minority rule, while distinctly less<br />\nviolent than the regime in South<br />\nAfrica, is based on the same<br />\nphilosophy as apartheid: one people are of a \"higher\" morality<br />\nand should be entrusted with all<br />\ndecision making power. If<br />\nnothing else, this will make their<br />\ntransition to supporting the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua much<br />\neasier.<br />\n<br />\nown campus as well as around the<br />\nnation this year. I find this renewed social consciousness on the<br />\npart of the nation's youth commendable. Perhaps Mr. Cazzaniga hasn't noticed any of this?<br />\nFurther, I hardly regard Hartgrave and McCarthy's feelings of<br />\nrevulsion caused by aboriton ads<br />\nas an example of this moral consciousness or student activism.<br />\nDoes Mr. Cazzaniga really<br />\nbelieve that by suggesting to Miss<br />\nHartgrave and Miss McCarthy<br />\nthat they either keep their opinions to themselves(or else more<br />\nsensibly think them out) so as not<br />\nto embarrass themselves in public, I am suggesting that they<br />\nnot exercise their right to free expression? There is a not-so-fine<br />\nline between criticizing someone's views and ridiculing<br />\nthem. Mr. Cazzaniga has failed to<br />\nmake this distinction in my letter.<br />\nHowever, perhaps I shouldn't be<br />\nso flippant with a matter as<br />\nserious as free expression.<br />\nPlease, Miss Hartgrave and Miss<br />\nMcCarthy, and you to Mr. Cazzaniga, feel free to publicly embarrass yourselves anytime you<br />\nwant.<br />\nI have no wish to debate the<br />\nabortion issue with Mr. Cazzaniga. It is enough that there are<br />\nlaws in this country which the<br />\nSupreme Court has handed down<br />\ndealing with abortion. He is, of<br />\ncourse, entitled to his opinion on<br />\nthese laws, just as I am.<br />\nHowever, I was quite disturbed<br />\nby one particular thing he said.<br />\nHe writes, \"Undeniably there is<br />\na varied ethnic and religious<br />\npresence here on campus, and<br />\nprinting ads that violate the basic<br />\ntenets of any of these groups<br />\nshould be unacceptable.\" This is<br />\nan extremely dangerous line of<br />\nreasoning. Suppose there was an<br />\nethnic or religious group on campus that was offended by the running of haircut ads in the paper?<br />\nDoes Mr. Cazzaniga suggest that<br />\nthe News-Letter stop running<br />\nthese ads also? This may seem<br />\nlike a humourous example but the<br />\nissue is very serious. Where<br />\nwould Mr. Cazzaniga have us<br />\n<br />\nCraig W.

The<br />\nNews-Letter was fortunate<br />\nenough to catch up with him<br />\nwhile he was cruising on impulse<br />\npower downtown.<br />\nNews-Letter: How did you get<br />\nthe role of Scotty?<br />\nWell, I didn't get a previous<br />\njob, and because of that job the<br />\ndirector of the pilot called me and<br />\nsaid \"I'd like you to do some of<br />\nyour accents for these Star Trek<br />\npeople.\" I said,\"Who are they?\"<br />\nSo he told me, and I said well,<br />\nwhat the heck . . .a job's a job. So<br />\nI went and I did the pilot, and the<br />\nrest is history.<br />\nI named him after my maternal<br />\ngrandfather, because my name is<br />\nJames Montgomery Doohan, and<br />\nhis name was James Montgomery, so I named him Montgomery<br />\nScott, because I wanted to get the<br />\nScottish in there.<br />\nSo the reason why Scotty is a<br />\nScotsman is because of your<br />\ngrandfather?<br />\nNo, no. I personally am Irish,<br />\n<br />\nbut the name Montgomery, 150<br />\nto 200 years ago, was Scottish.<br />\nSo I do have some Scotch in<br />\nme.. .but not recently, if you<br />\nunderstand that.<br />\nDid you have total control over<br />\nthe development of your character?<br />\nOh yeah. They found out things<br />\nlike Scott, or James Doohan read<br />\ntechnical journals, which I still do<br />\nto this day, and so they decided<br />\nfor themselves that \"Hey,James<br />\nDoohan reads technical journals,<br />\nwe're going to have Scotty read<br />\ntechnical journals.\"<br />\nStar Trek was the first science<br />\nfiction television series that<br />\ndeveloped a large following.

I think the only proper<br />\nanswer is that there is some kind<br />\nof hidden magic somewhere, and<br />\nwe're all part of it. I just can't<br />\nthink of any one thing, other than<br />\nwhat the fans say\u2014that it's the<br />\nplay between the characters. But<br />\nI would say that Star Trek was<br />\nfamous even before the play<br />\nbecame part and parcel of Star<br />\nTrek, you know.

But an atmosphere not unlike Frethlie's lair (from Nightmare<br />\non Elm Street) combined with the threat of expulsion manages to<br />\nkeep most Hoppies above ground. While the N-L doesn't advocate<br />\ntunnel exploration, we thought we'd print an anonymous account<br />\nof two freshmen's taste of Hopkins'forbidden fruit.<br />\nby Oglethorpe #2 and #3<br />\n<br />\nWhen the first week of Orientation had terminated, and all the<br />\nfun Hopkins had to offer had been<br />\ndelivered, three freshmen sought<br />\nelsewhere for their recreation.<br />\nWhile searching Gilman for an<br />\nentrance to the clock tower, they<br />\nstumbled upon the infamous<br />\nHopkins steam tunnels. It is<br />\nthrough many further experiences<br />\nthat they can make this information available describing Hopkins'<br />\nforbidden fruit.<br />\nBefore entering the tunnels you<br />\nwill need a few suggestions. The<br />\ntunnels require a lot of crawling<br />\nor climbing on concrete. This,<br />\ncombined with the heat of some<br />\npipes or sudden jets of -steam,<br />\n<br />\nmake long pants and a long sleeve<br />\nshirt imperative. To add to the<br />\nmysterious, as well as<br />\nmischievous atmosphere of the<br />\ntunnels, dark clothing is a must.<br />\nIt also makes you less visible to<br />\nthose roaming student monitors<br />\nand Campus Police. Flashlights<br />\nare needed for both the front of<br />\nthe group of explorers and the<br />\nrear. Conserve the flashlights<br />\nthough for when they are needed. About 75% of the tunnels are<br />\nlit by fluorescent light fixtures on<br />\nthe ceiling, and you will not always<br />\nfeel the need for a flashlight, but<br />\ntry to go through the unlit parts<br />\nof the tunnels without bumping<br />\nyour head or tripping and you<br />\nwill see why flashlights are<br />\na good idea.

The gratification<br />\nand excitement obtained from<br />\nfinally finding the tunnels is half<br />\nof the fun. Secondly, releasing information like that would send<br />\nsecurity swarming around the<br />\ntunnels, spoiling the forbidden<br />\nfruit for all future classes. Here,<br />\nhowever, are some hints:<br />\nSince the tunnels are fifteen to<br />\ntwenty feet below the campus<br />\ngrounds, the best place to look for<br />\nan entrance is on the ground.<br />\n(Lights from the tunnels are visible from certain places on campus.) There are also easier entrances. For the use of the maintainance crews, there are specially marked doors in many of the<br />\nbuildings on campus (see map).<br />\nAn obvious way to find out<br />\nhow to get in is to ask a friend<br />\nwho works in them. Believe it or<br />\nnot there are students who work<br />\nin the steam tunnels, wiring new<br />\nbuildings or doing lab work deep<br />\nin the basement of Mudd Hall.<br />\nAnother thing to watch for is construction around buildings. The<br />\nHomewood House is a good place<br />\nto look since a connection<br />\nunderground to the tunnels is<br />\ninevitable.<br />\nNow that your are inside, you<br />\nwant to know what you see. The<br />\nfirst thing you notice, whether<br />\nyou come in through the ground<br />\nor a building is the intense heat.<br />\nAs can be expected it is very<br />\nhumid as you walk through a wall<br />\nof heat. There are absolutely no<br />\nair currents. This heavy air and<br />\nlack of circulation make it<br />\nsomewhat difficult to breathe but<br />\nit's not dangerous.<br />\nThe physical structure of the<br />\ntunnels is astonishing considering<br />\ntheir age. Imagine youself placed in an eight foot by five foot<br />\nwide rectangular, cement tunnel.<br />\nLooking both behind and in front<br />\nof you, no end can be seen. Half<br />\nof the width of the tunnel is<br />\ndominated by a two-foot diameter<br />\nsteam pipe. This is surrounded by<br />\ntwo other pipes, one which runs<br />\ncold water, the other of unknown<br />\npurpose. A rectangular box<br />\nwhich runs atop the pipes holds<br />\nwiring which is fed into the<br />\nbuildings above. Occasionally<br />\nthere is a valve spraying steam or<br />\na pipe jutting out into your path.<br />\nThese pipes leave about two and<br />\n<br />\na half feet of walking space, often<br />\nforcing one to walk sideways.<br />\nThe tunnels themselves are<br />\nrelatively clean. At times it is<br />\nvery dusty, but aside from a few<br />\nsmall puddles and the light dirt on<br />\npipes and walls, you should remain relatively clean. Despite<br />\nwhat one might think, there are<br />\nno rats in the tunnels or noxious<br />\nfumes emanating from the<br />\nchemistry building. The worst<br />\nodor encountered is the smell of<br />\nrotting food corning from the<br />\nLevering Cafeteria.<br />\nBefore going down with the<br />\nmap, try exploring on your owl'.<br />\nIn some places considerate<br />\nworkers have labeled with arrows<br />\nthe paths to different buildings.<br />\nTrust them\u2014they are correct<br />\neven if they do not always make<br />\nsense.<br />\nOne of the tunnels, connecting<br />\nRemsen and AMR I, is infamous<br />\namong explorers. This tunnel,<br />\nwhich runs beneath the Freshman<br />\nQuad is affectionately labeled<br />\n\"Hell.\" Here the temperature is<br />\nabout 130 degrees, compared to<br />\n100 degrees elsewhere. The tunnel is about eight feet wide, but<br />\nseven feet are devoted to pipes.<br />\nThe tunnels lead to some fairly interesting things. The power<br />\nplant, behind Shaffer, is a fun<br />\nplace to explore, but is probably<br />\nthe most dangerous area to do so,<br />\nbecause it is generally guarded or<br />\nbeing worked on. It is usually<br />\nlocked by a gate to prevent intruders like yourself. Another<br />\npower plant is found near Mudd<br />\nHall. A small side room off of the<br />\ntunnels leads to a ladder attached<br />\nto a wall.<br />\nThere is a special structure<br />\nfound in the tunnels underneath<br />\nRowland. Referred to as the<br />\n\"Wheelchair Ramp,\" this cement structure is used as a<br />\nrecognition point for all who have<br />\never been down there. This section consists of four cement steps<br />\nnext to a ramp. On it, people have<br />\nwritten their names and the dates<br />\nthey have \"visited.\" Someone<br />\nhas written a story on the wall<br />\nnext to the ramp.

Inside,<br />\nhis first album for Columbia<br />\nRecords, is a recording whose<br />\nonly intention, according to Matthew, is \"to get music back to a<br />\nmore honest, special kind of communication, learning to be more<br />\nconcise and pare down my<br />\nmelodies for the people who'll<br />\nreally feel personally attached to<br />\nit.\" Unfortunately, I am not one<br />\nof these people. The album does<br />\nhave very simple melodies which<br />\nare accompanied by a drum<br />\nmachine, simple guitar riffs and<br />\nsoft vocals by Sweet. This combination amounts to a collection<br />\nof light and jumpy pop tunes,<br />\nvery similar to a-ha. Sweet worked with a variety of fine and wellknown producers, which is<br />\nreflected in the tight production<br />\non the album.<br />\nThis is capsulized in \"Save<br />\nTime for Me,\" the first single,<br />\nwhich Sweet co-wrote with Jules<br />\nShear, and which was also the<br />\nvery first track recorded for the<br />\nalbum.

This<br />\nfield of study is not fairly<br />\nrepresented by the popular conception of infallibly thinking<br />\ncomputers that take over the<br />\nworld. Artificial intelligence, or<br />\nto be more precise, computational<br />\nneuroscience, involves \"simulating human intelligence with a<br />\nneural network model,\" explained Dr. Sejnowski, Hopkins' expert in this field. Dr. Sejnowski's<br />\nresearch and study attempts to<br />\nunderstand the processes that are<br />\ninvolved in human thought by<br />\ncreating a model group, or network, of neurons (brain cells).<br />\nUnderstanding the way the<br />\nbrain works, and creating a<br />\nmodel involves many biophysical<br />\napplications\u2014one of which involves the study of neurons<br />\nthrough the use of fluorescent<br />\ndye. Researchers add the dye to<br />\nneurons, and the amount that appears in a neuron cell is proportional to the amount of calcium in<br />\nthe cell\u2014an element that is known<br />\nto be very important in brain<br />\nsignalling. For models, Dr. Sejnowski uses several computers to<br />\nrepresent a few of the billion<br />\nneurons in the brain. These<br />\n\"neuron models\" are then<br />\ngrouped into networks that work<br />\nproblems in parallel (several<br />\nneurons at a time)just like actual<br />\nneurons. The fact that different<br />\nparts of the brain specialize in dif-<br />\n<br />\nferent areas (speech, hearing,<br />\nsight, etc.) allowed Dr. Sejnowski to create neuron networks that specialize in separate<br />\nproblems. This is done by<br />\nteaching different networks different algorithms (methods of<br />\nprocedure to follow to approach<br />\nand solve a problem). After the<br />\nalgorithm has been taught to the<br />\nnetwork, the network is given a<br />\nproblem it has never seen before.<br />\nTo solve this problem, the network extracts the important<br />\nfeatures of the problem and<br />\nmakes a logical guess from what<br />\nit has. This ability to predict from<br />\nimportant bits of information is<br />\nwhat separates the average computer (that blindly memorizes<br />\ndata) from the human intellect. It<br />\nis also what makes this field of<br />\nstudy so fascinating.<br />\nDr.Sejnowski has thus far<br />\ncreated neuron networks of visual<br />\n(stereo binocular vision, and<br />\nshape recognition) and auditory<br />\n(speech conversion to text) functions, which he can study to better understand the workings of the<br />\nbrain in these problems. His advances in providing models,<br />\nalgorithmic teaching, and network functions constitute significant contributions to his field. His<br />\nresearch is funded by several<br />\nfoundations (Sloan, National<br />\nScience, Lounsbury, and Seaver)<br />\nand corporations (G.E., AlliedBendix).<br />\nWhat does computational<br />\n<br />\nCourtesy of Office of News and Information<br />\n<br />\nDr. Terrence J.

However, \"there is no<br />\nconsensus that divestment will in<br />\nfact have any positive impact on<br />\nthe eradication of apartheid.\"<br />\nHe added, \"A judgment that<br />\nthe simple and unexamined<br />\npresence of corporate operations<br />\nin South Africa is self-evident<br />\njustification for terminating<br />\nUniversity ownership of corporate stock at this time is not a<br />\nresponsible conclusion. Wholesale divestment of stocks of a<br />\nlarge number of corporations, including some of the most consistently successful American<br /><br />\nbusiness enterprises, and amounting in aggregate to a significant<br />\nfraction of the University's total<br />\ninvestments, would severely<br />\ncompromise the successful directives to professional managers to<br />\nmost effectively invest University funds.\"<br />\nThe Board's decision comes in<br />\nthe wake of announcements by<br />\nGeneral Motors and IBM that<br />\nthey would sell their South<br />\nAfrican operations. These moves<br />\nreduced the University's South<br />\nAfrica-related portfolio value by<br />\nsome $15 million, to about $65<br />\nmillion, according to Bond.<br />\nHowever, in addition to fears<br />\nthat total divestment would<br />\npossibly threaten the University's<br />\nsolvency, the Trustees based the<br />\nnew policy on what they called<br />\n\"fundamental principles of the<br />\nnature and operation of the<br />\nUniversity.\" Radcliffe stated,<br />\n\"As a community of scholarship<br /><br />\ncommitted to teaching, research<br />\nand public service, the University. . . must refrain from institutional commitment to a political<br />\nposition so as to preserve in full<br />\nthe freedom of expression and inquiry essential to its mission,<br />\ncharacter and integrity.\"<br />\nHe continued however, \"The<br />\nUniversity is a corporate citizen<br />\nwithin society and as such cannot<br />\nbe indifferent to manifest social<br />\nevil or injustice.\"<br />\nCoalition member Paul Genest<br />\ncalled the decision \"a day of<br />\nshame and sorrow.

Iran has come to represent, in popular and not-sopopular culture, a proto-typical<br />\nIslamic state.\"<br />\nHe referred to Iran's recent<br />\nhistory as that of a \"hijacked<br />\nrevolution,\" in which clerics<br />\nseized what was not rightfully<br />\ntheirs from a coalition of forces<br />\nseeking to overthrow the Shah.<br />\nToday Americans view Iran as<br />\na nation governed by fanatics, but<br />\nBakhash sought to examine the<br />\nforces that brought the Ayatollah<br />\nto power. \"On the surface, Iran<br />\nwas rapidly modernizing and industrializing. This led to a<br />\nsecularization and a secular<br />\ngovernment which was ultimately viewed by the people as<br />\nillegitimate.<br />\n\"Islamic identity was threatened by Western industrialization.<br />\nIn times of stress and strain people turn back to their tradition,\"<br />\nBakhash added. He cited the increase in religious book sales and<br />\na proliferation of informal religious discussion groups as signs of<br />\na strengthened religious element<br />\nunder the Shah.<br />\n\"Religious elements were to a<br />\nlarge degree independent from<br />\nthe state in the financial sphere<br />\nand were able to define the aims<br />\nof the revolution,\" he continued.<br />\n\"Islam itself offers a rich<br /><br />\nvocabulary for articulation of<br />\nsuch opposition,\" Bakhash claimed. Noting the martyrdoms of<br />\nearly Islam, which are frequently acted out in passion plays,<br />\nBakhash explained that such martyrdoms began to be interpreted<br />\nas not only feats of courage, but<br />\nalso of justice.<br />\nReferring to a scene in John<br />\nUpdike's novel Roger's Version,<br />\nhe explained that evil or \"the<br />\ndevil is not doubt, but rather<br />\nabsence of doubt. It is the absence<br />\nof doubt that pushes people into<br />\nsuicide bombings and death<br />\ncamps.\"<br />\nOf the present government<br />\nBakhash commented, \"In theory<br />\nat least, it is a theocracy. A<br />\nmassive shift has occurred since<br />\nthe revolution in the locus of<br />\npower. All laws must conform<br />\nwith Islamic law and clergy hold<br />\nall major offices of the state.\"<br />\nPerri concentrated his remarks<br />\non the Zionist movement in Israel<br />\nas another predominant example<br />\nof religious extremism in the<br />\nMiddle East. \"As a result of the<br />\n1967 Six-Day War, fundamentalism erupted into a full-fledged<br />\nmovement in Israel,\" he said.<br />\n\"That movement [of the New<br />\nZionist Fundamentalists] is the<br />\nalter ego of the Israeli society. By<br />\nunderstanding fundamentalism,<br />\nwe can better understand Israel,\"<br />\nhe explained.<br />\n\"The Zionist movement has<br />\nbeen very different from those<br />\nfundamentalist movements in the<br />\nArab world,\" Perri said. \"The<br />\nreasons are very unique: There<br />\nare renewed encounters of young<br />\nIsraelis with their biblical<br />\nheritage. They live and go to<br />\nplaces in the Holy Land where<br />\ntheir forefathers were.<br />\n\"The Jews lived for almost<br />\n2000 years in a religious way of<br />\nlife,\" he added. \"Jewish<br />\nsecularism is a new phenomenon.<br />\nSecular Jews are faced with a<br />\nproblem of identity. The definition of their identity that they<br />\nchose was nationalism. Zionism<br />\nwas their Jewish nationalism.\"<br />\nThis rise of secular nationalism<br />\nled to powerful tensions in the<br />\nJewish community, declared<br />\nPerri. \"Religious leaders were<br />\nvery much against Zionism,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br /><br />\nAccording to Perri, Zionist<br />\nfundamentalism became contrasted with and then incorporated<br />\ninto the Messianic concept. \"Messianism has been interpreted and<br />\nreinterpreted,\" he explained.<br />\nSince the second century<br />\nrebellions against the Romans,<br />\nthere has been a dispersion of the<br />\nJewish people. \"Active rebellion,<br />\nthat is, 'mounting the ramparts,'<br />\nis forbidden. [Messianism dictates that] you are to sit there and<br />\nbe a good Jew and wait for the<br />\nMessiah. In these terms the<br />\npolitical means of the Zionists<br />\nlooked horrible to traditional<br />\nJewish leaders.\"<br />\nThus a \"religious Zionism\"<br />\nevolved which Perri called \"a<br />\npractical, pragmatic approach to<br />\nthe Messianic concept. It said that<br />\nwe are near the Messianic era and<br />\nthat Jerusalem must therefore be<br />\nunder Israeli control. The Jews<br />\nalso can't be dispersed.\"<br />\nHe added,\"We are entering an<br />\nera where absolute sanctity rules<br />\nover corporeal reality. Return of<br />\none inch of territory [that was<br />\ncaptured in the Six-Day War]<br />\nwould be giving in to 'negative<br />\nmystical' forces.<br />\n\"The modern secular world is<br />\nseen as struggling for survival.<br />\nThe Yom Kippur War was a struggle against Western civilization,<br />\nwhich is the most common denominator in Jewish fundamentalism.\" Perri continued, \"The<br />\nland of Israel is sacred....Historical symbols have been<br />\ntransformed into holiness. The<br />\nconcept of sanctity has been applied to place.\"<br />\nPerri expressed his opinion that<br />\npolitical conflicts, especially<br />\nthose concerning Israeli occupied<br />\nterritory, show no signs of being<br />\nsolved soon. Under Zionist concepts, \"there cannot possibly be<br />\na place for Gentiles here [in<br />\nIsrael]. They work against this<br />\nsanctity...and this leaves no room<br />\nfor tolerance.\"<br />\nYet Perri emphasized that the<br />\nZionists made up only a small<br />\nminority in the Israeli political<br />\nscene. \"Their political aims of<br />\nannexation of the West Bank is<br />\ncommon to other factions, so<br />\nZionists still have support in the<br />\nKenesset.\"<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/5<br /><br />\nIllegal Immigrants Seeking<br />\nSanctuary Examined at MSE<br />\nby Tom McNamara<br />\nOn the night of Monday, October 27, a lecture entitled<br />\n\"Liberation Theology and the<br />\nSanctuary Movement in North<br />\nAmerica\" was given by Phil<br />\nWheaton of the Ecumenical Program for InterAmerican Communication and Action. The lecture was a part of the 1986 Milton<br />\nS. Eisenhower Symposium<br />\nseries.<br />\nThe presentation centered on<br />\nthe relatively recent actions of<br />\nchurches in the United States in<br />\nhelping refugees from Central<br />\nAmerican nations who are classed<br />\nas illegal immigrants in this<br />\ncountry.<br />\nWheaton said that there were<br />\ntwo primary, interrelated reasons<br />\nfor the decision of many religious<br />\nleaders to help these refugees.<br />\nThe first was that these leaders<br />\nhad heard of the \"bloodlettings\"<br />\nin nations such as El Salvador and<br />\nGuatemala directly from people<br />\nwho had escaped from these nations. These stories were not the<br />\nsame as those available from the<br />\npress in this country, Wheaton<br />\nsaid; the actual situation was<br /><br />\nworse than it had appeared.<br />\nThe second reason he gave was<br />\nthat many of the refugees claimed U.S. complicity in the practices of Central American dictatorships which the United States<br />\nsupports. He said that when the<br />\nAmericans involved in the sanctuary movement began to wonder<br />\nwhy the government was deporting those who had fled to this<br />\ncountry, these people claimed<br />\nthat it was because the United<br />\nStates was allied with the countries they were fleeing.<br />\nWheaton called the present<br />\nsanctuary movement among<br />\nmany different faiths \"a joint<br />\nministry of risk-taking.\" He<br />\nstressed that the churches had<br />\ndecided \"to side with the victims\" in the attempts of people<br />\nfrom Latin America to escape oppressive regimes, helping<br />\nrefugees with legal and other aid.<br />\nHe said that faced with \"an empire' \u2014a term Wheaton applies to<br />\nthe United States government\u2014<br />\nthe religious leaders had felt that<br />\nthe only way they could act was<br />\nby \"taking these people into their<br />\nlives.\" He tried to stress a difference between the actions of the<br /><br />\ngovernment of this country and 'of<br />\nits people.<br />\nAnother facet of \"Liberation<br />\nTheology\" which Wheaton<br />\npresented was that in the last few<br />\ndecades, the Catholic Church's<br />\n\"historical alignment has changed 180 degrees [in Central<br />\nAmerica], from the rich to the<br />\npoor.\" He said that small<br />\nreligious groups in Central<br />\nAmerica began to help people<br />\nthere to lose their \"fatalism,\"<br />\nand to see themselves as capable<br />\nof action, not merely as victims<br />\nof suffering. \"In my view, this is<br />\nthe most important thing to happen in Latin America in the last<br />\n400 years,\" he said.<br />\nHe explained that \"Liberation<br />\nTheology,\" theology concerned<br />\nwith helping the oppressed, has<br />\nchanged in recent years. \"Captivity represents the primary context within which we have to<br />\nwork,\" Wheaton said, comparing<br />\nthe plight of citizens of these<br />\ncountries to the \"Hebrew captivity in Egypt.\" He said that<br />\ntheology in Latin America often<br />\nused the exodus from Egypt as a<br />\n\"focal point,\" and claimed that<br />\nthis was the reason.<br /><br />\nGenetic Testing for Disease<br />\nRaises Ethical Implications<br />\nby Geir Magnusson<br /><br />\nthis technology becomes more accurate and advanced, Holtzman<br />\npredicts that \"the technology can<br />\nbe used to avoid conception\"<br />\nthrough alerting the parents,<br />\n\"and can be used during pregnancy to avoid birth\" through his<br />\ndiagnosis of disease in the fetus.<br />\nHoltzman also spoke about the<br />\ncommercial interest in genetic<br />\nforecasting. \"There are twenty<br />\ncompanies devoting fair amounts<br />\nof capital to find genetic-oriented<br />\ndiseases,\" he said, \"and many<br />\ncompanies are devoting efforts to<br />\nsimplify the technology.\"<br /><br />\nHoltzman emphasized that the<br />\ntests will be available before there<br />\nare effective treatments.<br />\nEmployers are also interested<br />\nin genetic forecasting, because of<br />\nits possibilities in reducing group<br />\ninsurance premiums. Because<br />\ngroup insurance premiums are<br />\nbased on the past health record of<br />\nthat group, employers with a way<br />\nof identifying high risk individuals (those with predisposition to disease) could possibly<br />\nbring down their health care<br />\npremiums by excluding those individuals from employment.<br /><br />\nLecturing on forecasting<br />\ndisease through genetic testing,<br />\nand its ethical implications, Neil<br />\nHoltzman spoke at The Office of<br />\nthe Chaplain's \"Sunday Experience.\" Holtzman spoke to an<br />\naudience composed of one<br />\nundergraduate, a few graduate<br />\nstudents, and a flock of senior<br />\ncitizens.<br />\nHoltzman, a senior analyst in<br />\nthe Office of Technology Assessment of Congress with joint appointments in Pediatrics and<br />\nEpidemiology at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical Institutions,<br />\nspoke about testing techniques<br />\nand how they can be used.<br />\nGenetic testing to forecast<br />\ndisease uses techniques that map<br />\nindividual genes in DNA that are<br />\n\"We are a religious people whose<br />\nContinued from Page 1<br />\nsuspected of causing diseases,<br />\ninstitutions presuppose a Supreme<br />\nHunanemia,<br />\nsickle<br />\ncell<br />\nsuch as<br />\ntington's Disease, and cystic tist churches and disrupted ser- Being.\"<br />\nRobertson then declared, \"The<br />\nfibrosis.

He began by questioning, \"How can apartheid be<br />\neliminated? And what can the<br />\nUniversity do?\" Newman stated<br />\nthat this issue was a \"matter of<br />\ngovernmental policy,\" and \"required a strong stance by the<br />\ngovernment....The failure of the<br />\nReagan administration to do so is<br />\ndeplorable.\"<br />\nTo answer the question concerning the University's role,<br />\nNewman said that the options<br />\nwere, \"to divest holdings. and to<br />\nboycott goods and services of<br />\ncompanies operating in South<br />\nAfrica,\" Newman contended that<br />\nboycotting would have the,<br />\n\"most direct effect on profits of<br />\nthe companies involved.\"<br />\nNewman also made the distinction between divestment and<br />\ndisinvestment. \"Divestment is<br />\nthe selling of stocks in American<br />\ncompanies operating in South<br /><br />\nAfrica,\" said Newman, and<br />\ndisinvestment was the \"walking<br />\naway from projects and investments in South Africa by<br />\nU.S. companies...which usually<br />\nbenefit the local capitalists.\" The<br />\ndisinvestment of GM and IBM<br />\nwere cited as examples. Newman<br />\ncontends, however, that GM and<br />\nIBM were motivated to withdraw<br />\nfrom South Africa, \"due to a lack<br />\nof profits,\" and that any other<br />\nreason was secondary.<br />\nReflecting on recent events at<br />\nthe University, Newman<br />\nwondered, \"Why all the fuss?<br />\nWhy should protest go this<br />\nway?...Students should concentrate on the Reagan administration to change policy.\" He continued, it \"seems to me, that<br />\nstudents and faculty tend to<br />\nmediate social issues through the<br />\nUniversity,\" which he found<br />\n\"weird.\" Newman concluded<br />\nwith, \"It makes the University<br />\nmore important than we are.<br />\nWe're just academics\u2014not<br />\nmoral.\"<br />\n\"I consider actual divestment<br />\nminor in the agenda for ending<br />\napartheid in South Africa,\" said<br />\nCohen. However, he considered<br /><br />\ndivestment as an important statement by the University. In the<br />\nwords of Cohen, it would send,<br />\n\"an important message to groups<br />\nin exile or imprisoned in South<br />\nAfrica.\"<br />\nAccording to Cohen, a decision<br />\nto divest, \"would be less powerful\" and assertive because of<br />\nIBM's and GM's recent disinvestment.<br />\nOn Hopkins divesting, Genest<br />\nsaid, he hopes that after the IBM<br />\nand GM disinvestment, that this<br />\nwould be easier. \"They [the<br />\nTrustees] said, 'what can we do<br />\nwithout IBM in our portfilio, it's<br />\nour anchor?\" Now that IBM<br />\nin fact disinvested, this argument<br />\nis no longer valid.<br />\nThe final panelist was<br />\nMauren, also a student at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nAccording to Mauren, many do<br />\nnot understand the \"financial<br />\nramifications of divestment, and<br />\nthat it would leave Hopkins<br />\nvulnerable.\" Mauren questioned,<br />\n\"How can we condemn the same<br />\ncorporations that Hopkins so<br />\nheavily depends on for financial<br />\nsupport?\"<br /><br />\nCampus Crime Report<br />\n*The complainant reported that<br />\nabout 6:05 p.m. on October 26,<br />\nwhile he was walking in the<br />\n3000 block of N.

The peaceful expression of ideas<br />\nis essential to any free society and absolutely necessary for the health of institutions<br />\nof higher learning. Unfortunately, though,<br />\nthe Coalition's rally quickly broke down to<br />\na shocking display \u2022of immaturity and<br />\nugliness when the results of the vote on<br />\ndivestment were released.<br />\nBefore the decision of the Board to continue investing in some companies that do<br />\nbusiness in South Africa was announced,<br />\nCoalition members spread out on the floor<br />\nof Q-Level attempting to block and trip<br />\nTrustees as they prepared to leave the Garrett Room. During this time, members of<br />\nthe Coalition shouted ugly remarks.<br /><br />\nLater, during a conference with University President Steven Muller, Chairman of<br />\nthe Board of Trustees George Radcliffe and<br />\ngathered Trustees, Coalition members turned their backs on the speakers when they<br />\nattempted to defend the vote. Some Coalition members even began shouting \"Nazi!\"<br />\nand \"Racist!\" while Muller and Radcliffe<br />\nwere speaking.<br />\nThe entire spectacle was an embarrassment for all members of this community.<br />\nCivil protest\u2014especially provocative<br />\nprotest\u2014rightfully occupies an important<br />\nplace in the resolution of many conflicts,<br />\nbut lack of civility never does. True nonviolent civil protest is based on respect for<br />\none's adversaries, never contempt. In the<br />\nCoalition's displays of immaturity, they<br />\nsucceeded only in losing any moral<br />\nlegitimacy they may have had in conducting the demonstration.<br />\nThe wisdom of the Board's vote is still<br />\nopen to debate, of course. As always, we<br />\nmaintain that the University ought to fully<br />\ndivest. But after the pathetic displays of the<br />\nCoalition on Monday, it has become ever<br />\nmore difficult to take the Coalition seriously<br />\nas a representative of those who advocate<br />\ndivestment. On Monday, the Coalition succeeded only in bringing shame to their<br />\ncause and to the University.<br /><br />\nA Call Unheeded:<br />\nSecuring a New Van<br />\nThe southeast side of the campus is in a<br />\nstate of siege. In less than six days, there<br />\nhave been at least six reported muggings<br />\nin the vicinity of 30th and Charles. It's time<br />\nfor the University to take action.<br />\nWithin the last two years, the University has made giant strides in the direction<br />\nof improving Homew000d security. By installing security phones, leveling large<br />\nbushes near footpaths, and increasing foot<br />\npatrols, among other things, the University has done much for the safety of its<br />\nstudents and staff.<br />\nNevertheless, shortcomings remain. In<br />\nthe wake of this week's rash of violent<br />\ncrime, it's time for the University to grapple with those shortcomings seriously and<br />\ntake the steps necessary to remedy them.<br />\nRevamping the security escort van program would be an excellent start.<br />\nSix weeks ago, we addressed the issue<br />\nof Homewood's escort van program and<br />\nconcluded that the service needs to be expanded. Because the van has been running<br />\nat near-capacity, van drivers and dispatchers have begun more active enforcement<br />\nof a policy of transporting students only to<br />\nand from the M.S.E. Library. Yesterday,<br />\nMajor Robert Larkin of Homewood Security confirmed that the policy is still in effect and that there are no current plans to<br />\nexpand the van escort service anytime soon.<br /><br />\nThe failure of the University to revamp<br />\nthe escort service needs to be reversed immediately. First, van drivers should be<br />\nallowed\u2014even encouraged\u2014to transport<br />\nstudents to and from off-campus locations.<br />\nThe only effect of insisting that the van be<br />\nused for transportation to and from the<br />\nlibrary is to discourage students from<br />\ntraveling safely\u2014exactly what the service<br />\nshouldn't be doing.<br />\nSecondly, another van ought to be added to the escort program to handle the increasing demands for its services. The cost<br />\nof a new van is a small price to pay if it<br />\nprevents Hopkins students from being attacked and mugged.<br />\nThe University's responsibilities to its<br />\nstudents don't end at the curb of Charles<br />\nStreet. On the contrary, the University has<br />\nan obligation to do everything possible to<br />\nprotect its students both on and off-campus.<br />\nIf Hopkins can't provide living accomdations for its students on campus, it ought<br />\nto at least provide a safe means for students<br />\nto move about the University community.<br />\nThis week, the administration needs to<br />\nreassess its security precautions for students<br />\nliving off-campus. Making the expansion<br />\nof the security escort service a top priority<br />\nwould certainly be a step to help avert the<br />\nkind of violence we have seen in the<br />\nHomewood area all too frequently.<br /><br />\nbrutally<br />\nfrank<br />\nFreshmen can expect the dorms<br />\nto metamorphosize into a stiffing<br />\ntropical hell as soon as the cold<br />\nweather really sets in. If the past<br />\ntwo years are any indication, the<br />\ndormitories suffer from more<br />\nthan just cafeteria food. The<br />\nheating system outperforms the<br />\nwildest dreams of any coldblooded lizard. Areas which do<br />\nnot enjoy overheating simply<br />\nfreeze. Aside from opening a<br />\nwindow in the middle of January<br />\nand alternating between freezing<br />\nblasts of cold and unbearable<br />\nheat, there seems to be no method<br />\nfor controlling the terror.<br />\nBut for real fun in ventilation,<br />\nnothing beats the Hut during the<br />\nwinter. For a city with mild<br />\nwinters, a city which can actually be claimed by the South, the<br />\nHomewood campus must be the<br />\nonly place designed to withstand<br />\nanother Ice Age. The Gilman<br />\nseminar rooms on the third floor<br />\nhave been called \"sweat boxes,\"<br />\nand it takes the imagination of an<br />\nearthworm to understand why.<br />\nOther buildings experience wild<br />\nvariations of temperature undoubtedly conjured by an unhinged sense of the creative.<br />\nThis sort of problem should be<br />\neasy to eliminate. Yet the<br />\nnuisance of the environs rise from<br />\nlowly trivia by the strength of<br />\ntheir numbers to become a<br />\nburden. Is a comfortable physical<br />\nrealm too much to ask of a<br />\nprestigious University?<br />\nThe University-owned apartments are dirty and ugly. There<br />\nis nothing to redeem them except<br />\na prime location. The renovation<br />\nof the dorms has given the school<br />\nsome decent living quarters. But<br />\nfor all of the stylish furniture<br />\nfound in the AMR lounges, there<br />\nis still a paucity of basic equip-<br /><br />\nment. Some rooms boast tables<br />\nrumored to be as old as the school<br />\nitself: nice enough for historical<br />\nvalue, but a sad comment on the<br />\nphysical condition of the<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nAmong the other things needed but missing are mailboxes.<br />\nDonald Faust, Postmaster, explains that the Gilman mail room<br />\nprocessed six million pieces of<br />\nmail last year, yet is \"out of<br />\nspace. Eventually it will have to<br />\ngo to three students for each<br />\nbox.\" Expansion plans for the<br />\npost office and bank, into the adjacent seminar rooms, were considered and then \"squashed.\"<br />\nMatters of entertainment are<br />\nhandled no better. The Levering<br />\ngame room wouldn't even make<br />\na second-rate arcade. Then there<br />\nare the \"large\" issues such as<br />\nlack of space in the library. Frequently overlooked in this<br />\ncategory is building access for the<br />\nhandicapped. As a friend on crutches reports, \"handicapped access is pretty poor.\" The<br />\nelevators which exist are<br />\nphenomenally slow and the marble steps of the Gilman Easybank<br />\nentrance are worn beyond just<br />\nhaving character.<br />\nCrossing Charles Street to<br />\nreach the Museum end of campus<br />\nis always a dangerous exercise.<br />\nNot only is there that rare car<br />\ncoming down Charles in the<br />\nsometimes-open wrong-way lane,<br />\nbut there are also plenty of impatient drivers poised at the Art<br />\nMuseum Drive intersection.<br />\nWhile this real-life video of<br />\nBaltimore traffic is not the Univsity's concern, it begins the day<br />\nfor many students and underscores the other nuisances well<br />\nwithin Hopkins' means to take<br />\ncare of.<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nTimothy McNamara<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nA.J.

Gordon's and<br />\nAssociate Professor L. Gottfredson's \"scientific\" findings. If<br />\neverybody has the right to express<br />\nhis or her opinion, everybody<br />\nshould also have the right to make<br />\nmistakes.<br />\nMy biggest concern, rather, is<br />\nabout the articles themselves and<br />\ntheir potentially dangerous and<br />\ndestructive impact on the social<br />\nfiber of a university which many<br />\nwant to consider a community.<br />\nIndeed, at no point does the<br />\nauthor clearly distance himself<br />\nfrom the two professors' study<br />\nand findings.On top of that, the<br />\ntitles are much too biased to leave<br />\nany doubt as to Gergyes' personal<br />\nopinion. These are obviously<br />\nmore than scientific reports: they<br />\nare openly racist statements.<br />\nI understand that the articles<br />\nsubmitted do not necessarily<br />\nreflect the views of the editorial<br />\nboard. Nevertheless, I would like<br />\nto suggest that, in the interest of<br />\nall here at Hopkins, the board of<br />\nthe News-Letter insists more on<br />\nquality and categorially dismisses<br />\npoor, low-level sensationalism<br />\neven disguised under the umbrella of science.<br />\nEric Tevoedjre<br /><br />\nAllergy to Plebiscites<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn wake of the Trustees' decision not to divest in full from<br />\ncompanies doing business with<br />\nSouth Africa, we hear the Coalition call for a \"binding\" referendum of all students and faculty<br />\nregarding the issue. Where does<br />\nthe Coalition find the gall to ask<br />\nfor such a \"binding\" plebiscite?<br />\nWhat gives the students the right<br />\nto play with funds that are not our<br />\nown? Our tuition barely pays for<br />\nten weeks of this institution's<br />\noperating budget.<br />\nSecondly, what makes the<br />\nCoalition believe that it is appropriate to set a precedent for<br />\nadministration by plebiscite?<br />\nWhatever the outcome of such a<br />\nreferendum, which I believe<br />\nwould support the Trustees, the<br />\ndamage done to the orderly and<br />\nrational administration of The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University would<br /><br />\nbe irreparable. After a binding<br />\nreferendum on the current issue,<br />\na not inconceivable progression<br />\nof matters to be decided in such<br />\na manner might include student<br />\nmanagement of the investment<br />\nportfolio, or perhaps even selection of administrative personnel<br />\nselection, from deans to secretaries. Is this a desirable state of<br />\naffairs? I think not.<br />\nI would like to close by quoting<br />\nMartin Peretz, Editor-in-Chief<br />\nand Chairman of The New<br />\nRepublic. In the 11-3-86 edition<br />\nof such magazine, Peretz, in<br />\nreference to referendums, say,<br />\n\"The Founding Fathers had a<br />\nhealthy allergy to plebiscitarian<br />\ndemocracy. . . The single-issue<br />\npassions provoked by referendums undermine representative<br />\ngovernment and civility in society as a whole.\" (p. 42)<br />\nPeretz Hirshbein<br /><br />\nShamed by Coalition<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nMonday's Trustees meeting was<br />\na success and a failure. The<br />\nUniversity and blacks in South<br />\nAfrica are better off, but the<br />\nstudents have been shamed by the<br />\nCoalition.<br />\nQuite simply, the Trustees did<br />\nwhat they should; they fulfilled<br />\ntheir fiduciary responsibility and<br />\nprotected the University endowment. Total divestment would<br />\ncost<br />\nHopkins<br />\nbetween<br />\n$1,000,000 and $1,500,000 in<br />\ntransaction costs alone. Divestment would also cost Hopkins<br />\ndearly in limiting the selection of<br />\nstocks for the endowment. Should<br />\nall Hopkins students be forced to<br />\npay for the whims of an annoying minority?<br />\nSouth African blacks also<br />\nbenefitted from Monday's<br />\nTrustees meeting was also a<br />\nblack leaders call for divestment,<br />\nthe majority of black South<br />\nAfricans oppose sanctions. The<br />\nreason why a disparity of opinion<br />\nexists is obvious. People like<br />\nBishop Tutu, whose children go<br />\nto school in the United States,<br />\nhave little to fear from increased<br />\nunemployment. The average<br />\nSouth African black knows that<br />\nhe or she has a responsibility to<br />\nhis or her family.<br />\nThe Coalition likes to remind<br />\nus that only one percent of black<br />\nSouth Africans work for U.S.<br />\ncompanies. Assuming that each<br />\nof these people has two or three<br />\nchildren, the number benefitting<br />\nfrom our presence quickly<br />\nbecomes three to four percent of<br />\nblack South Africans.

The Trustees of this University<br />\nselflessly and freely donate their<br />\ntime not to be harassed, but to ensure the suvivial and growth of<br />\nJohns Hopkins for the benefit of<br />\nall of us. I have heard many<br />\nstudents say that they were<br />\nashamed to be part of the University not because of the Trustees<br />\nbut because of the uncivilized<br />\nbehavior of the Coalition.<br />\nThe actions of the Coalition<br />\nbring me to a final point.

They prefer to impose a<br />\nminority opinion on all of us by<br />\nannoytng everyone until it is<br />\nworth millions of dollars to shut<br />\nthem up. Their brand of minority rule, while distinctly less<br />\nviolent than the regime in South<br />\nAfrica, is based on the same<br />\nphilosophy as apartheid: one people are of a \"higher\" morality<br />\nand should be entrusted with all<br />\ndecision making power. If<br />\nnothing else, this will make their<br />\ntransition to supporting the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua much<br />\neasier.<br /><br />\nown campus as well as around the<br />\nnation this year. I find this renewed social consciousness on the<br />\npart of the nation's youth commendable. Perhaps Mr. Cazzaniga hasn't noticed any of this?<br />\nFurther, I hardly regard Hartgrave and McCarthy's feelings of<br />\nrevulsion caused by aboriton ads<br />\nas an example of this moral consciousness or student activism.<br />\nDoes Mr. Cazzaniga really<br />\nbelieve that by suggesting to Miss<br />\nHartgrave and Miss McCarthy<br />\nthat they either keep their opinions to themselves(or else more<br />\nsensibly think them out) so as not<br />\nto embarrass themselves in public, I am suggesting that they<br />\nnot exercise their right to free expression? There is a not-so-fine<br />\nline between criticizing someone's views and ridiculing<br />\nthem. Mr. Cazzaniga has failed to<br />\nmake this distinction in my letter.<br />\nHowever, perhaps I shouldn't be<br />\nso flippant with a matter as<br />\nserious as free expression.<br />\nPlease, Miss Hartgrave and Miss<br />\nMcCarthy, and you to Mr. Cazzaniga, feel free to publicly embarrass yourselves anytime you<br />\nwant.<br />\nI have no wish to debate the<br />\nabortion issue with Mr. Cazzaniga. It is enough that there are<br />\nlaws in this country which the<br />\nSupreme Court has handed down<br />\ndealing with abortion. He is, of<br />\ncourse, entitled to his opinion on<br />\nthese laws, just as I am.<br />\nHowever, I was quite disturbed<br />\nby one particular thing he said.<br />\nHe writes, \"Undeniably there is<br />\na varied ethnic and religious<br />\npresence here on campus, and<br />\nprinting ads that violate the basic<br />\ntenets of any of these groups<br />\nshould be unacceptable.\" This is<br />\nan extremely dangerous line of<br />\nreasoning.

Many of us<br /><br />\nremember De Tocqueville's warning of the tyranny of the majority, but what about the tyranny of<br />\nthe minority? The Coalition<br />\nstands opposed, as almost<br />\neveryone does, to a minority of<br />\npeople having defacto and dejure<br />\ncontrol over the majority. So why<br />\ndon't they practice what they<br />\npreach? I want to know what right<br />\na group of students has to force<br />\ntheir views on all of us. I'm the<br />\nfirst one to agree that many<br />\nmembers of the Coalition are<br />\nearnest and well-informed, I<br />\nrespect their position. I do not<br />\nagree, and I do not think that just<br />\nbecause they raise hell they<br />\nshould be allowed to push a lot of<br />\npeople around.

I'm<br />\ntired of the Coalition's holierthan-thou attitude, their selfrighteousness. I'm moral too, and<br />\njust as humanitarian. I don't support apartheid, but I don't believe<br />\nin divestment either. The Coalition has thoroughly alienated me,<br />\nif you couldn't figure that one<br />\nout, and it has alienated a good<br />\npercentage of this campus, far<br />\nlarger than its own numbers.

So<br />\nI went and I did the pilot, and the<br />\nrest is history.<br />\nI named him after my maternal<br />\ngrandfather, because my name is<br />\nJames Montgomery Doohan, and<br />\nhis name was James Montgomery, so I named him Montgomery<br />\nScott, because I wanted to get the<br />\nScottish in there.<br />\nSo the reason why Scotty is a<br />\nScotsman is because of your<br />\ngrandfather?<br />\nNo, no. I personally am Irish,<br /><br />\nbut the name Montgomery, 150<br />\nto 200 years ago, was Scottish.<br />\nSo I do have some Scotch in<br />\nme.. .but not recently, if you<br />\nunderstand that.<br />\nDid you have total control over<br />\nthe development of your character?<br />\nOh yeah. They found out things<br />\nlike Scott, or James Doohan read<br />\ntechnical journals, which I still do<br />\nto this day, and so they decided<br />\nfor themselves that \"Hey,James<br />\nDoohan reads technical journals,<br />\nwe're going to have Scotty read<br />\ntechnical journals.\"<br />\nStar Trek was the first science<br />\nfiction television series that<br />\ndeveloped a large following. Do<br />\nyou have any feelings as to why<br />\nthat is so?<br />\nI tell you I don't think anyone<br />\nhas come up with a proper answer<br />\nas to why Star Trek is as great as<br />\nit is. I think the only proper<br />\nanswer is that there is some kind<br />\nof hidden magic somewhere, and<br />\nwe're all part of it. I just can't<br />\nthink of any one thing, other than<br />\nwhat the fans say\u2014that it's the<br />\nplay between the characters. But<br />\nI would say that Star Trek was<br />\nfamous even before the play<br />\nbecame part and parcel of Star<br />\nTrek, you know.

This,<br />\ncombined with the heat of some<br />\npipes or sudden jets of -steam,<br /><br />\nmake long pants and a long sleeve<br />\nshirt imperative. To add to the<br />\nmysterious, as well as<br />\nmischievous atmosphere of the<br />\ntunnels, dark clothing is a must.<br />\nIt also makes you less visible to<br />\nthose roaming student monitors<br />\nand Campus Police. Flashlights<br />\nare needed for both the front of<br />\nthe group of explorers and the<br />\nrear. Conserve the flashlights<br />\nthough for when they are needed. About 75% of the tunnels are<br />\nlit by fluorescent light fixtures on<br />\nthe ceiling, and you will not always<br />\nfeel the need for a flashlight, but<br />\ntry to go through the unlit parts<br />\nof the tunnels without bumping<br />\nyour head or tripping and you<br />\nwill see why flashlights are<br />\na good idea.

The gratification<br />\nand excitement obtained from<br />\nfinally finding the tunnels is half<br />\nof the fun. Secondly, releasing information like that would send<br />\nsecurity swarming around the<br />\ntunnels, spoiling the forbidden<br />\nfruit for all future classes. Here,<br />\nhowever, are some hints:<br />\nSince the tunnels are fifteen to<br />\ntwenty feet below the campus<br />\ngrounds, the best place to look for<br />\nan entrance is on the ground.<br />\n(Lights from the tunnels are visible from certain places on campus.) There are also easier entrances. For the use of the maintainance crews, there are specially marked doors in many of the<br />\nbuildings on campus (see map).<br />\nAn obvious way to find out<br />\nhow to get in is to ask a friend<br />\nwho works in them. Believe it or<br />\nnot there are students who work<br />\nin the steam tunnels, wiring new<br />\nbuildings or doing lab work deep<br />\nin the basement of Mudd Hall.<br />\nAnother thing to watch for is construction around buildings. The<br />\nHomewood House is a good place<br />\nto look since a connection<br />\nunderground to the tunnels is<br />\ninevitable.<br />\nNow that your are inside, you<br />\nwant to know what you see. The<br />\nfirst thing you notice, whether<br />\nyou come in through the ground<br />\nor a building is the intense heat.<br />\nAs can be expected it is very<br />\nhumid as you walk through a wall<br />\nof heat. There are absolutely no<br />\nair currents. This heavy air and<br />\nlack of circulation make it<br />\nsomewhat difficult to breathe but<br />\nit's not dangerous.<br />\nThe physical structure of the<br />\ntunnels is astonishing considering<br />\ntheir age. Imagine youself placed in an eight foot by five foot<br />\nwide rectangular, cement tunnel.<br />\nLooking both behind and in front<br />\nof you, no end can be seen. Half<br />\nof the width of the tunnel is<br />\ndominated by a two-foot diameter<br />\nsteam pipe. This is surrounded by<br />\ntwo other pipes, one which runs<br />\ncold water, the other of unknown<br />\npurpose. A rectangular box<br />\nwhich runs atop the pipes holds<br />\nwiring which is fed into the<br />\nbuildings above. Occasionally<br />\nthere is a valve spraying steam or<br />\na pipe jutting out into your path.<br />\nThese pipes leave about two and<br /><br />\na half feet of walking space, often<br />\nforcing one to walk sideways.<br />\nThe tunnels themselves are<br />\nrelatively clean. At times it is<br />\nvery dusty, but aside from a few<br />\nsmall puddles and the light dirt on<br />\npipes and walls, you should remain relatively clean. Despite<br />\nwhat one might think, there are<br />\nno rats in the tunnels or noxious<br />\nfumes emanating from the<br />\nchemistry building. The worst<br />\nodor encountered is the smell of<br />\nrotting food corning from the<br />\nLevering Cafeteria.<br />\nBefore going down with the<br />\nmap, try exploring on your owl'.<br />\nIn some places considerate<br />\nworkers have labeled with arrows<br />\nthe paths to different buildings.<br />\nTrust them\u2014they are correct<br />\neven if they do not always make<br />\nsense.<br />\nOne of the tunnels, connecting<br />\nRemsen and AMR I, is infamous<br />\namong explorers. This tunnel,<br />\nwhich runs beneath the Freshman<br />\nQuad is affectionately labeled<br />\n\"Hell.\" Here the temperature is<br />\nabout 130 degrees, compared to<br />\n100 degrees elsewhere. The tunnel is about eight feet wide, but<br />\nseven feet are devoted to pipes.<br />\nThe tunnels lead to some fairly interesting things. The power<br />\nplant, behind Shaffer, is a fun<br />\nplace to explore, but is probably<br />\nthe most dangerous area to do so,<br />\nbecause it is generally guarded or<br />\nbeing worked on. It is usually<br />\nlocked by a gate to prevent intruders like yourself. Another<br />\npower plant is found near Mudd<br />\nHall. A small side room off of the<br />\ntunnels leads to a ladder attached<br />\nto a wall.<br />\nThere is a special structure<br />\nfound in the tunnels underneath<br />\nRowland. Referred to as the<br />\n\"Wheelchair Ramp,\" this cement structure is used as a<br />\nrecognition point for all who have<br />\never been down there. This section consists of four cement steps<br />\nnext to a ramp. On it, people have<br />\nwritten their names and the dates<br />\nthey have \"visited.\" Someone<br />\nhas written a story on the wall<br />\nnext to the ramp.

And she obviously meant it\u2014she kept<br />\ngreeting old friends and<br />\nneighbors throughout her talk.<br />\nWinfrey, 32, was a co-anchor<br />\nat WJZ-TV and the co-host of<br />\n\"People Are Talking\" before she<br />\nbegan hosting \"The Oprah Winfrey Show,\" which is based in<br />\nChicago. She had plenty of<br />\nstories to tell about her early days<br />\nin Baltimore.<br />\nThe assistant news director at<br />\nWJZ felt that Winfrey's hair was<br />\ntoo thick and straight, so they sent<br />\nher to a fancy salon in New York<br />\nto get it permed. \"In a week, I<br />\nwas bald,\" she said. \"We<br />\n(blacks) define ourselves by our<br />\nhair\u2014'Good hair, girl.' It was so<br />\ndevastating. I remember crying a<br />\nlot.\"<br />\nWinfrey ended up wearing<br />\nscarves on the air. \"I have a very<br />\nbig head. We were not able to<br />\nfind a wig big enough to fit my<br />\nhead.\"<br />\nHowever, Winfrey said that<br />\nshe learned from those early<br />\ndownfalls and grew stronger<br />\nbecause of them. \"Everything<br />\nthat happens in our lives happens<br />\nfor a reason,\" she said.<br />\n\"I defined myself by the way<br />\nI looked; now I realize that the<br />\nability to affect change in your<br />\nlife comes not only from what<br />\nyou do, but what you think.\"<br />\nShe also talked about her<br />\nchildhood in Mississippi, where<br />\nBuckwheat of Little Rascals fame<br /><br />\nwas the only black role model on<br />\nT.V. \"For the longest time, I<br />\nreally wanted to be a little white<br />\ngirl,\" she said. \"I didn't think<br />\nwhite kids ever got whippings. . .1 realized I couldn't<br />\nchange the color of my skin, but<br />\nI've tried all those.\"<br />\nToday, Winfrey feels that being black is no disadvantage.<br />\n\"I'm not a person who uses race<br />\nas an excuse for anything. I<br />\nbelieve that excellence is the best<br />\ndeterrent to racism in 1986.<br />\n\"You are totally responsible<br />\nfor whether you succeed or fail.<br />\nIf you are the best, no one can tell<br />\nyou that 'you can't stay here.<br />\nWinfrey made it clear that she's<br />\nenjoying her success. \"This fame<br />\nthing is really a lot of fun,\" she<br />\nsaid. \"It's really a kick to walk<br />\ninto a store and be able to buy<br />\nanything you want. I'm more than<br />\nhappy, I'm delirious.\"<br />\nAfter the lecture, Winfrey took<br />\nquestions from the audience.<br />\nWhen quizzed about her future<br />\nplans, she revealed that there's a<br />\nT.V. sitcom in the works, and her<br />\nsecond film, Native Son, 1\" is<br />\ndue to be released in December.<br />\nHer most trying moment while<br />\nfilming \"The Color Purple,\"<br />\nwhere her performance as Sofia<br />\ngarnered her an Oscar nomination? \"I was asked to cry on cue<br />\nand couldn't,\" she said. \"I felt<br />\nso bad that I couldn't cry on cue,<br />\nI went home and cried all night.\"<br />\nAs for her goals, Winfrey said<br />\nthat, \"My goal is simply<br />\ngreatness. I know exactly who I<br />\nam and why I'm here. I don't fear<br />\nlosing this. Rocks fall, but people can stand if they desire to do<br />\nso.\"<br /><br />\n\"Oprah Was Talking\" here at the Homewood Campus last Friday night in Shriver Hall Auditorium.<br /><br />\nFrank Says It's a Good<br />\nPerformance from the HSO<br />\nby Frank Wu<br /><br />\nmembers of the Baltimore<br />\nAt the conclusion of the work,<br />\napplause continues until Perahia<br />\nShriver Hall is laid out with Symphony.<br />\nA woman in the audience sits returns for a fourth series of smilrow upon row of seats whose<br />\nitraight up, her hands cupped, ing, if stiff, bows.<br />\nbacks resemble nothing so much<br />\nAfter the intermission, Perahia<br />\nas giant fingernails brushed with almost leaning forward.

The album does<br />\nhave very simple melodies which<br />\nare accompanied by a drum<br />\nmachine, simple guitar riffs and<br />\nsoft vocals by Sweet.

This<br />\nfield of study is not fairly<br />\nrepresented by the popular conception of infallibly thinking<br />\ncomputers that take over the<br />\nworld. Artificial intelligence, or<br />\nto be more precise, computational<br />\nneuroscience, involves \"simulating human intelligence with a<br />\nneural network model,\" explained Dr. Sejnowski, Hopkins' expert in this field. Dr. Sejnowski's<br />\nresearch and study attempts to<br />\nunderstand the processes that are<br />\ninvolved in human thought by<br />\ncreating a model group, or network, of neurons (brain cells).<br />\nUnderstanding the way the<br />\nbrain works, and creating a<br />\nmodel involves many biophysical<br />\napplications\u2014one of which involves the study of neurons<br />\nthrough the use of fluorescent<br />\ndye. Researchers add the dye to<br />\nneurons, and the amount that appears in a neuron cell is proportional to the amount of calcium in<br />\nthe cell\u2014an element that is known<br />\nto be very important in brain<br />\nsignalling. For models, Dr. Sejnowski uses several computers to<br />\nrepresent a few of the billion<br />\nneurons in the brain. These<br />\n\"neuron models\" are then<br />\ngrouped into networks that work<br />\nproblems in parallel (several<br />\nneurons at a time)just like actual<br />\nneurons. The fact that different<br />\nparts of the brain specialize in dif-<br /><br />\nferent areas (speech, hearing,<br />\nsight, etc.) allowed Dr. Sejnowski to create neuron networks that specialize in separate<br />\nproblems. This is done by<br />\nteaching different networks different algorithms (methods of<br />\nprocedure to follow to approach<br />\nand solve a problem). After the<br />\nalgorithm has been taught to the<br />\nnetwork, the network is given a<br />\nproblem it has never seen before.<br />\nTo solve this problem, the network extracts the important<br />\nfeatures of the problem and<br />\nmakes a logical guess from what<br />\nit has. This ability to predict from<br />\nimportant bits of information is<br />\nwhat separates the average computer (that blindly memorizes<br />\ndata) from the human intellect. It<br />\nis also what makes this field of<br />\nstudy so fascinating.<br />\nDr.Sejnowski has thus far<br />\ncreated neuron networks of visual<br />\n(stereo binocular vision, and<br />\nshape recognition) and auditory<br />\n(speech conversion to text) functions, which he can study to better understand the workings of the<br />\nbrain in these problems. His advances in providing models,<br />\nalgorithmic teaching, and network functions constitute significant contributions to his field. His<br />\nresearch is funded by several<br />\nfoundations (Sloan, National<br />\nScience, Lounsbury, and Seaver)<br />\nand corporations (G.E., AlliedBendix).<br />\nWhat does computational<br /><br />\nCourtesy of Office of News and Information<br /><br />\nDr. Terrence J. Sejnowski, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Biophysics at Homewood, uses computers to simulate<br />\nhuman intelligence and enhance understanding of mental processes.<br />\nneuroscience hope to achieve in<br />\nthe next decade? \"If we could<br />\nunderstand one cubic millimeter<br />\nof cortex [brain matter] in the<br />\nnext ten years, it would be a great<br />\nadvancement,\" replied Dr. Sejnowski. Undergraduates who are<br />\ninterested in this field should have<br />\na curriculum that emphasizes<br /><br />\nmath and physics, and courses in<br />\nbiophysics, biopsychology, and<br />\nneuroscience should be taken.<br />\nThe planning of a Hopkins<br />\nMind-Brain Institute in the near<br />\nfuture will be an important event<br />\nfor researchers of this field<br />\nbecause it will be dedicated to the<br />\nunderstanding and advancement<br /><br />\nof brain study.
