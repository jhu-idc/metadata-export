Olsen<br />\nSlow Learner by Thomas Pynchon. Little, Brown. 193 pages.<br />\n$14.95.<br />\nOne of the things that has<br />\nfascinated\u2014and<br />\nalways<br />\nperhaps annoyed\u2014followers of<br />\nThomas Pynchon is his persistence in leading a reclusive,<br />\nisolated life. For years, he has<br />\nrefused to grant interviews, to<br />\nbe photographed, or to give<br />\nreadings or talks. In fact, few<br />\npeople even know where he<br />\nlives. It is rumored that his<br />\nhome is in California or Mexico, but almost no one knows<br />\nof him except through his three<br />\npublished novels\u2014V (1963),<br />\nThe Crying of Lot 49 (1966),<br />\nand Gravity's Rainbow (winner<br />\nof the National Book Award in<br />\n1973).<br />\nNow, taking advantage of<br />\nPynchon's associal nature, Little, Brown has published Slow<br />\nLearner, a compilation of five<br />\nof his early short stories which<br />\nappeared in various journals<br />\nfrom 1959-1964, plus a new introduction by the author. It is<br />\nthis introduction which has called attention to this book. If it<br />\nwere written by almost anyone<br />\nother than Pynchon, Slow<br />\nLearner probably wouldn't<br />\nhave been published; the stories<br />\nare,<br />\non<br />\nthe<br />\nwhole,<br />\nunremarkable. But because of<br />\nthe intense clampdown Pyn-<br />\n<br />\nchon maintains on his private<br />\nlife, his followers have grown<br />\nanxious to learn more about<br />\nhim. There have been<br />\nnumerous studies of his work,<br />\nand even a few character sketches of him, but personal insight remains as lean as ever.<br />\nIt is no surprise then, that the<br />\npublishers of Slow Learner<br />\nchoose to make more noise<br />\nabout the introduction than<br />\nabout the pages which follow:<br />\n\"...I now pretend to have reached a<br />\nlevel of clarity about the young writer<br />\nI was back then,\" Pynchon writes in a<br />\ndisarming and candid introduction. Indeed, as he proceeds to describe the<br />\ngenesis of the stories, evoke the cultural<br />\nidiosyncrasies that attended them, and<br />\ntake stock of each one's strengths and<br />\nfrailties, he reveals more about himself<br />\nas a writer\u2014young and old\u2014than his<br />\ndecoders would have dared hope.<br />\nFrom the book's jacket<br />\n<br />\nThe stories, though not<br />\nalways easily obtainable, have<br />\nbeen around for years; only the<br />\nintroduction is new. In a sense,<br />\nthis book isn't so much by Pynchon as it is about him. The<br />\nstrategy in putting out this collection of apprentice fiction<br />\nseems to be that readers of the<br />\nstories will be looking more<br />\nclosely at how these pieces are<br />\nreflected in the three later<br />\nnovels rather than how they<br />\nstand up on their own.<br />\n<br />\nIt is to Pynchon's credit that<br />\nhe doesn't claim to think very<br />\nhighly of these stories. They<br />\nwere, after all, written long ago<br />\nby a brilliant, though not yet<br />\ndeveloped, engineering student<br />\nat Cornell University, whose<br />\nforte turned out to be writing<br />\nnovels.<br />\nOn May 8, Pynchon will be<br />\n47; that means he was only 22<br />\nwhen the first story, \"The<br />\nSmall Rain,\" was published in<br />\nthe Cornell Writer. It is certainly better than the work of most<br />\n22-year-olds writing today, but<br />\nit is, like all the stories in Slow<br />\nLearner, far below the Pynchon<br />\nstandard we have come to<br />\nexpect.<br />\nIn addition to \"The Small<br />\nRain,\" the book contains:<br />\n\"Low-lands\", New World<br />\nWriting, March 1960; \"Entropy\", Kenyon Review, Spring<br />\n1960; \"Under the Rose,\" The<br />\nNoble Savage 3, May 1961; and<br />\n\"The Secret Integration,\" The<br />\nSaturday Evening Post,<br />\nDecember 1964. These stretch<br />\ninto 193 pages, but the margins<br />\nare wide and the print is large.<br />\nIf Gravity's Rainbow, which is<br />\n800 or so pages in paperback,<br />\nwere published in this form, it<br />\nwould be about three feet high.<br />\nThe introduction really is the<br />\nbook's saving grace, and one of<br />\nthe things Pynchon does frequently in it is try to turn his<br />\ndissatisfaction for his stories into advice for young writers.<br />\n<br />\nBLOOD DRIVE<br />\n<br />\nAlthough the advice is of a<br />\nrudimentary nature, so little is<br />\never heard from Pynchon that<br />\nthese \"hints\" seem to take on<br />\nsignificance because they are<br />\nprobably the last words his<br />\ndevotees will see for several<br />\nyears. He often injects phrases<br />\nlike \"The lesson here is...\" in<br />\nan attempt to make the introduction more than just a<br />\nmonologue.<br />\nIncidentally, Pynchon mentions that he originally thought<br />\nabout doing a \"wall-to-wall<br />\nrewrite\" for these stories, but<br />\ndecided against it. In an<br />\n\"episode of middle-aged tranquility,\" he subdued the impulse to alter the work of the<br />\nyoung writer he was \"back<br />\nthen.\" He writes, \"I mean I<br />\ncan't very well just 86 this guy<br />\nfrom my life.\"<br />\nOverall, Slow Learner is the<br />\nkind of book you wait for your<br />\nlibrary to get. While almost<br />\nanyone who has read one or<br />\nmore Pynchon novels instinctively would be interested in<br />\nseeing his earlier stuff\u2014if for<br />\nno other reason than because it<br />\nisn't nearly as long\u2014it is not<br />\nthe kind of thing that can't<br />\nwait. One of the stories, for example,\"Under the Rose,\" is an<br />\nexpanded version of an episode<br />\nthat later appeared in V. It is interesting to compare these two<br />\ntexts and see the ways in which<br />\none became the other, but this<br />\ndoesn't make \"Under the<br />\n<br />\nRose\" any more enjoyable by<br />\nitself, as a short story and supposedly a good read. Pynchon<br />\ncan be a tough author to get<br />\nthrough; his prose is often<br />\ndense and cryptic, as are his<br />\nthemes, and requires a good<br />\ndeal of attention. All that the<br />\nstories in Slow Learner offer is<br />\na chance to see the writer in his<br />\ndeveloping stages. Except for<br />\nperhaps those most-devoted<br />\nPynchon groupies, it probably<br />\nisn't worth the effort. The introduction is certainly interesting; it contains a few tidbits of \"personal\" insights into the author, a new assortment<br />\nof Pynchoesque witticism, as<br />\nwell as an occasional reference<br />\nto a contemporary (including<br />\nthe \"normally unhoodwinkable<br />\nDonald Barthelme, \"but leaving out, unfortunately, Pynchon's late friend, Richard<br />\nFarina). But while entertaining<br />\nand informative, the introduction can't stand on its own,<br />\nmuch as the publisher would<br />\nlike it to.<br />\nIf you've never read Pynchon but would like to, pick up<br />\nThe Crying of Lot 49 or V. If<br />\nyou've read him and are slightly interested in this collection,<br />\nwait until your library or friend<br />\ngets it. Slow Learner is admittedly second-rate Pynchon, and<br />\nis worth $14.95 only to the true<br />\nfanatic.<br />\n<br />\nMove Yourself,<br />\nAll Your Stuff,<br />\nAnd Save,Too!<br />\n<br />\nDate Wednesday, May 2,1984<br />\nPlace Glass Pavilion<br />\nTime--9:00 a.m.-2:45 p.m.<br />\nJust Show Up or<br />\n<br />\nIt's as easy as renting a Ryder truck,one way.<br />\n<br />\nor Local<br />\n<br />\nCall 8502 for appt.<br />\n<br />\nFor Reservations Call<br />\n233- 1 200<br />\nIIIII MI INN NMI IIIII IMO<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nPizza and Other Prizes<br />\nto the Groups With the Most Donors<br />\n<br />\n' RYDER TRUCK RENTAL I<br />\n<br />\nI 25% DISCOUNT CARD:<br />\nLium_ in WM= NM In MIMD=IIIIN IMO<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nClip This Coupon and Save!<br />\n<br />\n\f7-<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/7<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\n<br />\nNot Only Students Are Apathetic at Hopkins<br />\nby William Dwyer<br />\nMost people assume that<br />\nJohns Hopkins undergraduates<br />\nare capable of making wise<br />\ndecisions in their academic and<br />\nextracurricular activities. Most<br />\nof us enjoy and take pride in<br />\nthis freedom. But that freedom<br />\nand our dedication to achievement make it extremely difficult<br />\nto make the choices necessary<br />\nfor a well-rounded education.<br />\nFor many of us, the responsibility is too large.<br />\nHopkins' administration and<br />\nfaculty also have failed to face<br />\nmany of their responsibilities to<br />\nundergraduate education. Most<br />\nprofessors lecture and advise in<br />\na perfunctory manner, reserving time and meticulous care<br />\nfor their research. Moreover,<br />\nthe faculty and administration<br />\nlack centralized leadership and<br />\nthe ability to work on interdepartmental projects.<br />\nDepartments at Johns Hopkins<br />\nare strong because they are<br />\nautonomous. Indeed, in the<br />\nwords of a Homewood dean,<br />\n\"Orders don't come down<br />\nfrom above by fist here; you<br />\ncan't tell the departments what<br />\nto do.\"<br />\nThe detrimental effect of the<br />\nfaculty's careerism and individualism manifests itself in<br />\nthe absence of common course<br />\nrequirements. Professors prefer<br />\nto teach, if not in their research<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\ncont. from p. 6<br />\n<br />\nfields, at least in their own<br />\nacademic disciplines; the faculty does not value being able to<br />\nthink critically on subjects outside of their specialties.<br />\nSimilarly, Hopkins undergraduates, particularly science<br />\nand engineering majors, aren't<br />\nforced to study subjects outside<br />\nof their specializations.<br />\nThe temptation to model<br />\nyourself after your peers', and<br />\nyour professors', dedication to<br />\none subject is overwhelming.<br />\nFreshman year, the required<br />\ncourse in chemistry, physics<br />\nand math seldom allows you to<br />\ntake more than one course in<br />\nthe humanities. And even when<br />\nan engineer has time for<br />\nEnglish or history, the experience in those distinguished<br />\ndepartments<br />\noften<br />\nis<br />\nfrustrating. It's much easier to<br />\nask \"Why bother?\" and forge<br />\nahead in hopes of graduating<br />\nearly. Thus, many students<br />\nhave not had the chance to<br />\nfulfill their potential in dealing<br />\nwith ideas, and eventually with<br />\ntheir aspirations.<br />\nAt Hopkins, then, no \"dark<br />\nnights of the soul\" exist. Few<br />\nundergraduates have struggled<br />\nby trying to see beyond their<br />\nsuccess in lab or on a calculus<br />\ntest. As a result, we have<br />\nengineers who do not question<br />\nworking for Martin-Marietta or<br />\nbuilding missiles. We have<br />\nchemists who will look the<br />\n<br />\nother way when products which<br />\nfail FDA requirements are sold<br />\nto other countries. We have<br />\nengineers who will be too willing to help American car<br />\nmanufacturers_ maximize profits despite the possible loss in<br />\nautomobile safety. Even<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller fails to realize that the<br />\ndelivery system of a nuclear<br />\nweapon is as crucial as the<br />\nwarhead itself.<br />\nBut that is a large part of the<br />\nproblem: Hopkins' faculty and<br />\nadministration shun responsibility. Just as the University<br />\nprefers not to discuss its heavy<br />\ninvolvement with the Defense<br />\nDepartment, the faculty refuses<br />\nto provide the time and the<br />\nenergy needed to deliver a wellrounded education. The administration's idea of an \"individual\" undergraduate experience doesn't include offering credit classes at Peabody or<br />\nrequiring a physical education<br />\ncourse. These opportunities<br />\nhave been eliminated and<br />\nclassified as being unlike<br />\nHopkins. Dean Norman<br />\nKrueger also has consistently<br />\navoided requests for additional<br />\noff-campus security, and<br />\nstorage space in empty housing<br />\nunits during the summer. The<br />\ngeneral feeling is that we're on<br />\nour own after freshman year.<br />\nThe apathy and lack of concern for others among the<br />\n<br />\never having really thought<br />\nBe More Tactful<br />\nabout them.<br />\nRecently, however, I came To the Editor:<br />\nacross a \"scandal\" in your<br />\nDoreen Moran is mistaken if<br />\npages that demands a response she thinks there will ever be<br />\nfrom me.

While some students paid<br />\nattention to it, most students did not. So<br />\nwe're giving it another try.<br />\nIf you don't remember the reason for the<br />\nfirst such weekend, we've decided to<br />\nhighlight some points from last year's article:<br />\nMost people have a lot of friends at<br />\nHopkins, but not as many as they could.<br />\nPrimarily it's because they're afraid to use<br />\nsome of the knowledge they've acquired at<br />\nsuch a small school.<br />\nThink of all the people you know things<br />\nabout, but just don't know personally\u2014facts<br />\nfrom the Student Directory and the<br />\nFreshman Register or even gossip.<br />\nBasically, the only thing that keeps us<br />\nfrom making all these new friends is shyness.<br />\nSo, at this time of year. with the sun finally<br />\nupon us and with the party atmosphere of<br />\n<br />\nSpring Fair, we propose a way for Hopkins<br />\nstudents to overcome their jitters and to improve their social lives.<br />\n<br />\nThis weekend, whenever you see someone<br />\nwhose name you know, but whom you don't<br />\nknow personally, say, \"Hi,\" to him or to<br />\nher. This will promote, we hope, a greater<br />\nrapport among Hopkins students, or, at the<br />\nvery least, give you a chance to freak out a<br />\nbunch of strangers.<br />\nYou may be walking down the quad, eating a Belgian waffle, when suddenly someone to whom you've never been introduced<br />\nsays, \"Hi, (your name).\" You may drop<br />\nyour waffle or, better yet, you may strike up<br />\na conversation.<br />\nSo keep an eye out.

At first, he wasn't<br />\nsure whether he could make one<br />\nbecause of an upcoming physics<br />\ntest and the MCAT. He asked<br />\nme to check with him again a<br />\nweek later.<br />\nAfter talking to him a second<br />\ntime Sunday night, one week<br />\nbefore the elections, Evan tentatively agreed to deliver a<br />\nposter Tuesday night and said<br />\nhe would leave it with his<br />\nroommates.<br />\nThat night, I went to his<br />\napartment, but Evan didn't<br />\nleave a poster. I assumed he<br />\nprobably had other obligations,<br />\nand imagined he would have it<br />\nthe following night, but he<br />\ndidn't.<br />\nRealizing that Evan might<br />\nnot be able to come through on<br />\nhis promise, I asked a friend of<br />\nmine, Seth Baker, to rework a<br />\nprevious poster.

He said he didn't.<br />\nThen after the primary elections, word had gotten back to<br />\nme that Evan was telling people he had not given permission<br />\nto use his Fred Factorial logo,<br />\nwhich is untrue; after all, Evan<br />\nhad seen the poster and didn't<br />\nobject. That evening I wrote a<br />\nletter to Evan, after unsuccessfully trying to find him,expressing confusion with what I<br />\nwas hearing and explaining why<br />\nI believed he had given his approval for the use of his logo.<br />\nIn that letter, I wrote that I was<br />\nsurprised and shocked that he<br />\nwas telling people he did not<br />\ngive me his permission.

Yet, it<br />\nis not as simple as that. These<br />\nalleged assailants appear to<br />\nhave gained a reputation of<br />\nhaving at least a marginal<br />\namount of athletic prowess and<br />\nhave used this skill to repeatedly escape punishment.<br />\nIt now is time for this injustice to end. this was not a<br />\nsingular, unique incident on the<br />\npart of the people responsible.<br />\nIf it were, though it could still<br />\nnot be justified, it could be<br />\nmore easily understood.

What they did<br />\nTuesday night was barbaric and<br />\nunwarranted. It was not a simple barroom brawl. It cannot<br />\nbe, and should not be,justified<br />\non any level. The fact that this<br />\nincident is one of many makes<br />\nit even worse. Whether guilt<br />\ncan be proven in a court of law<br />\nwill be up to a judge.

Journalists Kunetka and<br />\nStrieber abandon their secure<br />\nsurroundings to discover how<br />\nthe limited nuclear war of 1988,<br />\nknown as Warday, affected the<br />\nU.S. Their book compiles the<br />\ndocuments and other information that they gathered on their<br />\njourneys across the U.S.<br />\nThe incidents and reflections<br />\nabout which they write are<br />\nrevealing. The hug has replaced the handshake as the<br />\ngreeting. The U.S. has become<br />\nmore heterogenous as a result<br />\nof the war. Most of the blacks,<br />\nalong with the other less affluent minorities, have disappeared, for they weren't able to<br />\ncope with the impending<br />\ndisaster. San Antonio has been<br />\nobliterated by the attack. And<br />\nCalifornia has closed off its<br />\nborders and practically has<br />\nbecome its own country.<br />\nAmong the other casualties<br />\nof Warday are \"six out of every<br />\nten dollars\" that were lost when<br />\nthe American electronic network was destroyed by Soviet<br />\natmospheric nuclear explosions<br />\nover the U.S.; the entire<br />\nWashington upper hierarchy<br />\n(the closest surviving official to<br />\nthe President is the Assistant<br />\nSecretary of the Treasury);<br />\nseven million lives directly from<br />\nthe first explosion; and 160<br />\n<br />\nmillion lives worldwide from a sense to understand one<br />\nflu epidemic in the aftermath. another.

But Washington added<br />\nsingle runs in the fifth and<br />\nseventh innings and the -game<br />\nwent to the bottom of the<br />\nseventh with Washington<br />\nleading 3-1.<br />\nThe Blue Jays looked like<br />\nthey might pull the game out<br />\nwith a rally in the seventh.<br />\nCampbell led off with a single<br />\nup the middle and Miller<br />\nfollowed with a walk. A wild<br />\npitch put the tying runs in scoring position with nobody out.<br />\nBut the rally fizzled, as Jim<br />\nHobensack struck out, Jim<br />\nCardwell popped out to second<br />\nand Landolphi struck out.<br />\nLast Wednesday, Hopkins<br />\nplayed Dickinson College. The<br />\nBlue Jays were soundly beaten<br />\n9-3. The loss was one of the few<br />\nbad performances by Campbell, who was roughed up for<br />\nnine runs.<br />\n<br />\nThe Franklin and Marshall<br />\nDiplomats came to Homewood<br />\nfield last Friday. The story of<br />\nthis game was sophomore righthander Geoff Bender (3-1, 1.41<br />\nERA). He pitched a masterful<br />\ncomplete-game shutout, striking out 8 and giving up only 5<br />\nhits.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins' final two wins were<br />\na result of a double header<br />\nsweep of Gettysburg College on<br />\nSaturday. The Blue Jays simply overpowered their opponent.<br />\nJeff Comen (2-1, 0.92 ERA)<br />\npicked up the win in the first<br />\ngame 7-3, giving up only 2 hits<br />\nand no earned runs.

Following<br />\nthe games, the alumni, the<br />\nplayers and their families will<br />\nhave cocktails, while they talk<br />\nover the past, present and<br />\nfuture of Blue Jay baseball.<br />\nThe Playoff Picture: The<br />\nJays are still in the race for the<br />\ndivision title and a chance at the<br />\nMAC Playoffs. Washington<br />\nCollege is guaranteed a tie for<br />\nthe division. But if Hopkins can<br />\nsweep against Haverford (2-6 in<br />\nMAC), the weak sister of the<br />\nleague, they will finish in a tie<br />\nwith Washington at 7-3.<br />\nWidener College could also be<br />\nin the picture if they win a<br />\nmakeup game that was called<br />\nbecause of darkness\u2014their<br />\nrecord would also be 7-3. A<br />\nplayoff would take place to<br />\ndetermine who would go to the<br />\nMAC's.<br />\nWillie Raedle has been in a<br />\nmini-slump, going hitless in his<br />\nlast ten at bats, but he still leads<br />\nthe team in hitting at .409.<br />\n<br />\nOther leading hitters are Billy<br />\nMiller (.345), Bobby Cardwell<br />\n(.305), Craig Brooks (.300,<br />\nteam leading 15 runs scored and<br />\n21 hits), Scott Burns (.300, 11<br />\nRBI, 21 hits), and Jon Meltzer<br />\n(.250, team leading 13 RBI).<br />\nThe team ERA is an outstanding 2.59. Geoff Bender has<br />\nbeen the star of the staff recently. He has pitched well all<br />\nseason, but he has been untouchable on a number of occasions of late. He would be my<br />\nstarting pitcher in any key game<br />\ndown the stretch . . . It is easy<br />\nto be a leader when you are<br />\nleading the team in hitting and<br />\nrun production.

Olsen<br />\nSlow Learner by Thomas Pynchon. Little, Brown. 193 pages.<br />\n$14.95.<br />\nOne of the things that has<br />\nfascinated\u2014and<br />\nalways<br />\nperhaps annoyed\u2014followers of<br />\nThomas Pynchon is his persistence in leading a reclusive,<br />\nisolated life. For years, he has<br />\nrefused to grant interviews, to<br />\nbe photographed, or to give<br />\nreadings or talks. In fact, few<br />\npeople even know where he<br />\nlives. It is rumored that his<br />\nhome is in California or Mexico, but almost no one knows<br />\nof him except through his three<br />\npublished novels\u2014V (1963),<br />\nThe Crying of Lot 49 (1966),<br />\nand Gravity's Rainbow (winner<br />\nof the National Book Award in<br />\n1973).<br />\nNow, taking advantage of<br />\nPynchon's associal nature, Little, Brown has published Slow<br />\nLearner, a compilation of five<br />\nof his early short stories which<br />\nappeared in various journals<br />\nfrom 1959-1964, plus a new introduction by the author. It is<br />\nthis introduction which has called attention to this book. If it<br />\nwere written by almost anyone<br />\nother than Pynchon, Slow<br />\nLearner probably wouldn't<br />\nhave been published; the stories<br />\nare,<br />\non<br />\nthe<br />\nwhole,<br />\nunremarkable. But because of<br />\nthe intense clampdown Pyn-<br /><br />\nchon maintains on his private<br />\nlife, his followers have grown<br />\nanxious to learn more about<br />\nhim. There have been<br />\nnumerous studies of his work,<br />\nand even a few character sketches of him, but personal insight remains as lean as ever.<br />\nIt is no surprise then, that the<br />\npublishers of Slow Learner<br />\nchoose to make more noise<br />\nabout the introduction than<br />\nabout the pages which follow:<br />\n\"...I now pretend to have reached a<br />\nlevel of clarity about the young writer<br />\nI was back then,\" Pynchon writes in a<br />\ndisarming and candid introduction. Indeed, as he proceeds to describe the<br />\ngenesis of the stories, evoke the cultural<br />\nidiosyncrasies that attended them, and<br />\ntake stock of each one's strengths and<br />\nfrailties, he reveals more about himself<br />\nas a writer\u2014young and old\u2014than his<br />\ndecoders would have dared hope.<br />\nFrom the book's jacket<br /><br />\nThe stories, though not<br />\nalways easily obtainable, have<br />\nbeen around for years; only the<br />\nintroduction is new. In a sense,<br />\nthis book isn't so much by Pynchon as it is about him. The<br />\nstrategy in putting out this collection of apprentice fiction<br />\nseems to be that readers of the<br />\nstories will be looking more<br />\nclosely at how these pieces are<br />\nreflected in the three later<br />\nnovels rather than how they<br />\nstand up on their own.<br /><br />\nIt is to Pynchon's credit that<br />\nhe doesn't claim to think very<br />\nhighly of these stories. They<br />\nwere, after all, written long ago<br />\nby a brilliant, though not yet<br />\ndeveloped, engineering student<br />\nat Cornell University, whose<br />\nforte turned out to be writing<br />\nnovels.<br />\nOn May 8, Pynchon will be<br />\n47; that means he was only 22<br />\nwhen the first story, \"The<br />\nSmall Rain,\" was published in<br />\nthe Cornell Writer. It is certainly better than the work of most<br />\n22-year-olds writing today, but<br />\nit is, like all the stories in Slow<br />\nLearner, far below the Pynchon<br />\nstandard we have come to<br />\nexpect.<br />\nIn addition to \"The Small<br />\nRain,\" the book contains:<br />\n\"Low-lands\", New World<br />\nWriting, March 1960; \"Entropy\", Kenyon Review, Spring<br />\n1960; \"Under the Rose,\" The<br />\nNoble Savage 3, May 1961; and<br />\n\"The Secret Integration,\" The<br />\nSaturday Evening Post,<br />\nDecember 1964. These stretch<br />\ninto 193 pages, but the margins<br />\nare wide and the print is large.<br />\nIf Gravity's Rainbow, which is<br />\n800 or so pages in paperback,<br />\nwere published in this form, it<br />\nwould be about three feet high.<br />\nThe introduction really is the<br />\nbook's saving grace, and one of<br />\nthe things Pynchon does frequently in it is try to turn his<br />\ndissatisfaction for his stories into advice for young writers.<br /><br />\nBLOOD DRIVE<br /><br />\nAlthough the advice is of a<br />\nrudimentary nature, so little is<br />\never heard from Pynchon that<br />\nthese \"hints\" seem to take on<br />\nsignificance because they are<br />\nprobably the last words his<br />\ndevotees will see for several<br />\nyears. He often injects phrases<br />\nlike \"The lesson here is...\" in<br />\nan attempt to make the introduction more than just a<br />\nmonologue.<br />\nIncidentally, Pynchon mentions that he originally thought<br />\nabout doing a \"wall-to-wall<br />\nrewrite\" for these stories, but<br />\ndecided against it. In an<br />\n\"episode of middle-aged tranquility,\" he subdued the impulse to alter the work of the<br />\nyoung writer he was \"back<br />\nthen.\" He writes, \"I mean I<br />\ncan't very well just 86 this guy<br />\nfrom my life.\"<br />\nOverall, Slow Learner is the<br />\nkind of book you wait for your<br />\nlibrary to get. While almost<br />\nanyone who has read one or<br />\nmore Pynchon novels instinctively would be interested in<br />\nseeing his earlier stuff\u2014if for<br />\nno other reason than because it<br />\nisn't nearly as long\u2014it is not<br />\nthe kind of thing that can't<br />\nwait. One of the stories, for example,\"Under the Rose,\" is an<br />\nexpanded version of an episode<br />\nthat later appeared in V. It is interesting to compare these two<br />\ntexts and see the ways in which<br />\none became the other, but this<br />\ndoesn't make \"Under the<br /><br />\nRose\" any more enjoyable by<br />\nitself, as a short story and supposedly a good read. Pynchon<br />\ncan be a tough author to get<br />\nthrough; his prose is often<br />\ndense and cryptic, as are his<br />\nthemes, and requires a good<br />\ndeal of attention. All that the<br />\nstories in Slow Learner offer is<br />\na chance to see the writer in his<br />\ndeveloping stages. Except for<br />\nperhaps those most-devoted<br />\nPynchon groupies, it probably<br />\nisn't worth the effort. The introduction is certainly interesting; it contains a few tidbits of \"personal\" insights into the author, a new assortment<br />\nof Pynchoesque witticism, as<br />\nwell as an occasional reference<br />\nto a contemporary (including<br />\nthe \"normally unhoodwinkable<br />\nDonald Barthelme, \"but leaving out, unfortunately, Pynchon's late friend, Richard<br />\nFarina). But while entertaining<br />\nand informative, the introduction can't stand on its own,<br />\nmuch as the publisher would<br />\nlike it to.<br />\nIf you've never read Pynchon but would like to, pick up<br />\nThe Crying of Lot 49 or V. If<br />\nyou've read him and are slightly interested in this collection,<br />\nwait until your library or friend<br />\ngets it.

Most<br />\nof us enjoy and take pride in<br />\nthis freedom. But that freedom<br />\nand our dedication to achievement make it extremely difficult<br />\nto make the choices necessary<br />\nfor a well-rounded education.<br />\nFor many of us, the responsibility is too large.<br />\nHopkins' administration and<br />\nfaculty also have failed to face<br />\nmany of their responsibilities to<br />\nundergraduate education. Most<br />\nprofessors lecture and advise in<br />\na perfunctory manner, reserving time and meticulous care<br />\nfor their research. Moreover,<br />\nthe faculty and administration<br />\nlack centralized leadership and<br />\nthe ability to work on interdepartmental projects.<br />\nDepartments at Johns Hopkins<br />\nare strong because they are<br />\nautonomous. Indeed, in the<br />\nwords of a Homewood dean,<br />\n\"Orders don't come down<br />\nfrom above by fist here; you<br />\ncan't tell the departments what<br />\nto do.\"<br />\nThe detrimental effect of the<br />\nfaculty's careerism and individualism manifests itself in<br />\nthe absence of common course<br />\nrequirements. Professors prefer<br />\nto teach, if not in their research<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\ncont. from p. 6<br /><br />\nfields, at least in their own<br />\nacademic disciplines; the faculty does not value being able to<br />\nthink critically on subjects outside of their specialties.<br />\nSimilarly, Hopkins undergraduates, particularly science<br />\nand engineering majors, aren't<br />\nforced to study subjects outside<br />\nof their specializations.<br />\nThe temptation to model<br />\nyourself after your peers', and<br />\nyour professors', dedication to<br />\none subject is overwhelming.<br />\nFreshman year, the required<br />\ncourse in chemistry, physics<br />\nand math seldom allows you to<br />\ntake more than one course in<br />\nthe humanities. And even when<br />\nan engineer has time for<br />\nEnglish or history, the experience in those distinguished<br />\ndepartments<br />\noften<br />\nis<br />\nfrustrating. It's much easier to<br />\nask \"Why bother?\" and forge<br />\nahead in hopes of graduating<br />\nearly. Thus, many students<br />\nhave not had the chance to<br />\nfulfill their potential in dealing<br />\nwith ideas, and eventually with<br />\ntheir aspirations.<br />\nAt Hopkins, then, no \"dark<br />\nnights of the soul\" exist. Few<br />\nundergraduates have struggled<br />\nby trying to see beyond their<br />\nsuccess in lab or on a calculus<br />\ntest. As a result, we have<br />\nengineers who do not question<br />\nworking for Martin-Marietta or<br />\nbuilding missiles. We have<br />\nchemists who will look the<br /><br />\nother way when products which<br />\nfail FDA requirements are sold<br />\nto other countries. We have<br />\nengineers who will be too willing to help American car<br />\nmanufacturers_ maximize profits despite the possible loss in<br />\nautomobile safety. Even<br />\nUniversity President Steven<br />\nMuller fails to realize that the<br />\ndelivery system of a nuclear<br />\nweapon is as crucial as the<br />\nwarhead itself.<br />\nBut that is a large part of the<br />\nproblem: Hopkins' faculty and<br />\nadministration shun responsibility. Just as the University<br />\nprefers not to discuss its heavy<br />\ninvolvement with the Defense<br />\nDepartment, the faculty refuses<br />\nto provide the time and the<br />\nenergy needed to deliver a wellrounded education. The administration's idea of an \"individual\" undergraduate experience doesn't include offering credit classes at Peabody or<br />\nrequiring a physical education<br />\ncourse. These opportunities<br />\nhave been eliminated and<br />\nclassified as being unlike<br />\nHopkins. Dean Norman<br />\nKrueger also has consistently<br />\navoided requests for additional<br />\noff-campus security, and<br />\nstorage space in empty housing<br />\nunits during the summer. The<br />\ngeneral feeling is that we're on<br />\nour own after freshman year.<br />\nThe apathy and lack of concern for others among the<br /><br />\never having really thought<br />\nBe More Tactful<br />\nabout them.<br />\nRecently, however, I came To the Editor:<br />\nacross a \"scandal\" in your<br />\nDoreen Moran is mistaken if<br />\npages that demands a response she thinks there will ever be<br />\nfrom me.

While some students paid<br />\nattention to it, most students did not. So<br />\nwe're giving it another try.<br />\nIf you don't remember the reason for the<br />\nfirst such weekend, we've decided to<br />\nhighlight some points from last year's article:<br />\nMost people have a lot of friends at<br />\nHopkins, but not as many as they could.<br />\nPrimarily it's because they're afraid to use<br />\nsome of the knowledge they've acquired at<br />\nsuch a small school.<br />\nThink of all the people you know things<br />\nabout, but just don't know personally\u2014facts<br />\nfrom the Student Directory and the<br />\nFreshman Register or even gossip.<br />\nBasically, the only thing that keeps us<br />\nfrom making all these new friends is shyness.<br />\nSo, at this time of year. with the sun finally<br />\nupon us and with the party atmosphere of<br /><br />\nSpring Fair, we propose a way for Hopkins<br />\nstudents to overcome their jitters and to improve their social lives.<br /><br />\nThis weekend, whenever you see someone<br />\nwhose name you know, but whom you don't<br />\nknow personally, say, \"Hi,\" to him or to<br />\nher.

The first is pretty good, but a bit dull.

But the image of<br />\ncomplete and total destruction<br />\ndoesn't appear here. The image<br />\nis rather of partial destruction<br />\nand partial chaos.

Your<br />\nhome town? If you survived a<br />\nnuclear war, what would life be<br />\nlike in the U.S.?<br />\nThe search for truth begins in<br />\n1992. Journalists Kunetka and<br />\nStrieber abandon their secure<br />\nsurroundings to discover how<br />\nthe limited nuclear war of 1988,<br />\nknown as Warday, affected the<br />\nU.S. Their book compiles the<br />\ndocuments and other information that they gathered on their<br />\njourneys across the U.S.<br />\nThe incidents and reflections<br />\nabout which they write are<br />\nrevealing.

Most of the blacks,<br />\nalong with the other less affluent minorities, have disappeared, for they weren't able to<br />\ncope with the impending<br />\ndisaster.
