The difference between the amoeba and the dog<br />\n<br />\nTo satisfy the advocates of rugged<br />\nand ragged individualism, one afternoon could be designated as Pond<br />\nDay, during which there would be<br />\ninformal fighting around the pond.<br />\nSpeaking from two-fold experience,<br />\nwe know that a good ducking will<br />\nnot dampen enthusiasm. On the contrary, it will make one all the more<br />\ndesirous of giving back just as much<br />\nas he gets.<br />\nAlthough many people condemn<br />\nHell Week as being babyish, primitive and purposeless, we cannot<br />\nagree with them. We think that this<br />\nbattle does more to promote goodwill, enthusiasm, and spirit than any<br />\nother activity on the campus. The<br />\nHopkins undergraduate schools are<br />\nnot so well supplied with school spirit that they can afford to forego this<br />\ncolorful institution.<br />\n<br />\nBy EDGAR<br />\nThe<br />\nstages.<br />\ntwo<br />\nis that of the first<br />\ndifference between such men as Calvin Coolidge, Huey Long, etc., as<br />\nagainst Swift, Samuel Butler, and<br />\nPlato is the difference of the third<br />\nand fourth stages.<br />\nNow what is the attitude which one<br />\ngroup of animals takes towards anAs for the Dog and the<br />\nother?<br />\nAmoeba, it is difficult to venture a<br />\nstatement. It is probable that by a<br />\nlong delayed route the Dog eats various animals which eat the Amoeba.<br />\nSo much for the Dog's attitude. Now<br />\nMan, looking below, has such a distain for the Dog, that that beast has<br />\nbeen incorporated among Man's most<br />\nviolent invectives. So much for that.<br />\nBut the Mentarian, what does he<br />\nthink? Here it is found that in almost<br />\nthe identical way in which Men eat<br />\nCows without the least worry as to<br />\nbovine problems, except in so far as<br />\nthose problems concern their food<br />\nsupply,\u2014so the Mentarians indiscriminately eat the Human Dullards<br />\nwith their satire, being restrained<br />\nonly by the consideration that such<br />\nDullards are after all the source of<br />\ntheir remuneration.<br />\nBut any antagonism between Mentarians and Men lies even deeper than<br />\nThroughout history, it has<br />\nthat.<br />\nbeen the Men themselves who have<br />\ntaken the initiative. They trampled<br />\ndown the pride of a Jonathan Swift,<br />\nkept him groveling for twenty years<br />\nas a lacky to insolent Bores, and let<br />\nhim die, a terrible, insane death. They<br />\nlaughed at Pope, taunted Machiavelli,<br />\npoisoned Socrates. For his thoughts,<br />\nthey burned Bruno; for his science,<br />\nthey jailed Roger Bacon; and for his<br />\nquiet wisdom, they stoned Leonardo<br />\nda Vinci. It is certainly no mere<br />\nfantasy to state that Mentarians are<br />\nnot only a breed apart\u2014but are separated by an uncrossable gulf of<br />\nhatred.<br />\nIII. Progress<br />\nMen have fooled themselves into believing that they've been rapidly becoming greater and greater. Haven't<br />\nthey telephones, airplanes, and almost<br />\ncomplete tyranny over nature herSure, but look closer\u2014look<br />\nself?<br />\nagain at this splendid civilization\u2014<br />\nthe result of centuries of avarice.<br />\nThis triumph of man is nothing but<br />\na mound of comfort elevated by the<br />\nseat of somewhat gifted savages. Is<br />\nthe 20th Century savage superior to<br />\nthe Pre-Christian savage merely because he sits on more cushions?<br />\nThere are still wars, murders, and<br />\npersecution, bloody as ever. Indeed,<br />\nit would seem that Men had not advanced one whit these two thousand<br />\nyears. Having emerged from the natural state which produced them,<br />\nthey seem to have stopped evolving<br />\n\u2014to have come to a blind alley like<br />\nthat which the dinosaurs once entered.<br />\nMen are threatened with stagnation!<br />\n<br />\nKEMLER<br />\nevolving for maybe a billion years in<br />\nits blind fashion, finally an end-product, a -Mentarian, becomes aware of<br />\npart of that process by which he was<br />\ncreated. And in the hands of the<br />\nMentarians, this knowledge is a wonderful tool.<br />\nIf Men can no longer progress and<br />\nthe Mentarians have been failures all<br />\nthese years, what is wrong? The<br />\npoint is that life can no longer evolve<br />\nblindly. If the Mentarians, the men<br />\nof the future, will survive, they must<br />\nuse the tool which Darwin gave<br />\nthem.<br />\nThey must artificially make<br />\nplans to save themselves and the<br />\nprogress of the Animal Kingdom. No<br />\nlonger does the world see an unconscious evolution. From now on, it<br />\nmust be a conscious and MILITANT<br />\ndrive ahead!<br />\nIV. The Class Struggle<br />\nSince the late Russian Bolshevik<br />\nRevolution, there has been in the<br />\nUnited States a general enlistment of<br />\nMentarians in the working-class parties. Sympathy for the exploited is<br />\npartly the cause\u2014and also, perhaps,<br />\nthe assumption that the intellectual<br />\ncan be a leader or teacher of a revolutionary movement.<br />\nIt seems that the great movements<br />\nof history have been nothing more<br />\nthan the wholesale violence of groups<br />\nof people who themselves have suffered violence. Each group is desperate; each seeks to satisfy its appetites at the others' expense. But an<br />\nintellectual leader, a non-acquisitive<br />\nbombast\u2014where does he come in?<br />\nCan he share the avarice of the mob,<br />\ntheir frenzy, madness, and control<br />\nthe mass emotion?

Man<br /><br />\nImproving Hell<br />\nSoph-Frosh Hell Week proved to<br />\nbe too much of a good thing. Unofficially begun two days before it was<br />\nscheduled to open, its spirit died a<br />\nday before it was scheduled to close.<br />\nAs a consequence the greased ball<br />\nrush, which was to provide a grand<br />\nfinale, was a fiasco.<br />\nIn the past two years, we have had<br />\nthe opportunity to witness the two<br />\nextreme forms which Hell Week may<br />\ntake. Last year the activities were<br />\ncut to a minimum. This year it was<br />\neverybody for himself and the devil<br />\ntake the hindmost, with the \"hindmost\" usually going into Freshman<br />\npond.<br />\nHaving observed the comparative<br />\nmerits of the two systems we have<br />\ncome to the conclusion that the one<br />\nis too tame, and the other, too extreme. So we offer a plan which we<br />\nhope will satisfy both the desires of<br />\nthe avaricious leftist wing of pantspuller-off-ers and the conservative<br />\ngroup which prefers to keep its pants<br />\non.<br />\nThis year, hostilities were started<br />\ntoo late in the season.

The difference between the amoeba and the dog<br /><br />\nTo satisfy the advocates of rugged<br />\nand ragged individualism, one afternoon could be designated as Pond<br />\nDay, during which there would be<br />\ninformal fighting around the pond.<br />\nSpeaking from two-fold experience,<br />\nwe know that a good ducking will<br />\nnot dampen enthusiasm. On the contrary, it will make one all the more<br />\ndesirous of giving back just as much<br />\nas he gets.<br />\nAlthough many people condemn<br />\nHell Week as being babyish, primitive and purposeless, we cannot<br />\nagree with them. We think that this<br />\nbattle does more to promote goodwill, enthusiasm, and spirit than any<br />\nother activity on the campus. The<br />\nHopkins undergraduate schools are<br />\nnot so well supplied with school spirit that they can afford to forego this<br />\ncolorful institution.<br /><br />\nBy EDGAR<br />\nThe<br />\nstages.<br />\ntwo<br />\nis that of the first<br />\ndifference between such men as Calvin Coolidge, Huey Long, etc., as<br />\nagainst Swift, Samuel Butler, and<br />\nPlato is the difference of the third<br />\nand fourth stages.<br />\nNow what is the attitude which one<br />\ngroup of animals takes towards anAs for the Dog and the<br />\nother?<br />\nAmoeba, it is difficult to venture a<br />\nstatement. It is probable that by a<br />\nlong delayed route the Dog eats various animals which eat the Amoeba.<br />\nSo much for the Dog's attitude. Now<br />\nMan, looking below, has such a distain for the Dog, that that beast has<br />\nbeen incorporated among Man's most<br />\nviolent invectives. So much for that.<br />\nBut the Mentarian, what does he<br />\nthink? Here it is found that in almost<br />\nthe identical way in which Men eat<br />\nCows without the least worry as to<br />\nbovine problems, except in so far as<br />\nthose problems concern their food<br />\nsupply,\u2014so the Mentarians indiscriminately eat the Human Dullards<br />\nwith their satire, being restrained<br />\nonly by the consideration that such<br />\nDullards are after all the source of<br />\ntheir remuneration.<br />\nBut any antagonism between Mentarians and Men lies even deeper than<br />\nThroughout history, it has<br />\nthat.<br />\nbeen the Men themselves who have<br />\ntaken the initiative. They trampled<br />\ndown the pride of a Jonathan Swift,<br />\nkept him groveling for twenty years<br />\nas a lacky to insolent Bores, and let<br />\nhim die, a terrible, insane death. They<br />\nlaughed at Pope, taunted Machiavelli,<br />\npoisoned Socrates. For his thoughts,<br />\nthey burned Bruno; for his science,<br />\nthey jailed Roger Bacon; and for his<br />\nquiet wisdom, they stoned Leonardo<br />\nda Vinci. It is certainly no mere<br />\nfantasy to state that Mentarians are<br />\nnot only a breed apart\u2014but are separated by an uncrossable gulf of<br />\nhatred.<br />\nIII. Progress<br />\nMen have fooled themselves into believing that they've been rapidly becoming greater and greater. Haven't<br />\nthey telephones, airplanes, and almost<br />\ncomplete tyranny over nature herSure, but look closer\u2014look<br />\nself?<br />\nagain at this splendid civilization\u2014<br />\nthe result of centuries of avarice.<br />\nThis triumph of man is nothing but<br />\na mound of comfort elevated by the<br />\nseat of somewhat gifted savages. Is<br />\nthe 20th Century savage superior to<br />\nthe Pre-Christian savage merely because he sits on more cushions?<br />\nThere are still wars, murders, and<br />\npersecution, bloody as ever. Indeed,<br />\nit would seem that Men had not advanced one whit these two thousand<br />\nyears. Having emerged from the natural state which produced them,<br />\nthey seem to have stopped evolving<br />\n\u2014to have come to a blind alley like<br />\nthat which the dinosaurs once entered.<br />\nMen are threatened with stagnation!<br /><br />\nKEMLER<br />\nevolving for maybe a billion years in<br />\nits blind fashion, finally an end-product, a -Mentarian, becomes aware of<br />\npart of that process by which he was<br />\ncreated. And in the hands of the<br />\nMentarians, this knowledge is a wonderful tool.<br />\nIf Men can no longer progress and<br />\nthe Mentarians have been failures all<br />\nthese years, what is wrong? The<br />\npoint is that life can no longer evolve<br />\nblindly. If the Mentarians, the men<br />\nof the future, will survive, they must<br />\nuse the tool which Darwin gave<br />\nthem.<br />\nThey must artificially make<br />\nplans to save themselves and the<br />\nprogress of the Animal Kingdom. No<br />\nlonger does the world see an unconscious evolution. From now on, it<br />\nmust be a conscious and MILITANT<br />\ndrive ahead!<br />\nIV. The Class Struggle<br />\nSince the late Russian Bolshevik<br />\nRevolution, there has been in the<br />\nUnited States a general enlistment of<br />\nMentarians in the working-class parties. Sympathy for the exploited is<br />\npartly the cause\u2014and also, perhaps,<br />\nthe assumption that the intellectual<br />\ncan be a leader or teacher of a revolutionary movement.<br />\nIt seems that the great movements<br />\nof history have been nothing more<br />\nthan the wholesale violence of groups<br />\nof people who themselves have suffered violence. Each group is desperate; each seeks to satisfy its appetites at the others' expense. But an<br />\nintellectual leader, a non-acquisitive<br />\nbombast\u2014where does he come in?<br />\nCan he share the avarice of the mob,<br />\ntheir frenzy, madness, and control<br />\nthe mass emotion? Napoleon once<br />\nsaid, \"The nation must have a head<br />\n\u2014a head who is rendered illustrious<br />\nby glory, and not by fine phrases and<br />\nthe talk of idealists.\" And Napoleon<br />\nwas a notorious success.
