There had been efforts to establish one, in two of which I took<br />\npart, but the faculty was not then in the mood and we applied in vain for<br />\nPermission to go ahead. Even our much-loved class annual, the first of the Hullabaloos, had many trials and tribulations before we finally produced it upon the<br />\nstage of Un:versity life. This little foreword in a reminiscential vein is only<br />\npenned because it serves to measure my gratification at the success which has<br />\nattained the publication of THE NEWS- LETTVR. I have always held to the theory<br />\nthat a college paper, well-edited, may become a valuable aid in the development<br />\nOf that 'varsity spirit which seems essential to the growth and popularity of an<br />\ninstitution like the Johns Hopkins. This, I feel sure, has been proven by THE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS LETTER.<br />\nI have been asked to write something for this issue of THE NEws-LETTER.<br />\ncan think of nothing better than to contribute a leaf out of my own story as a<br />\nw.arning to some now in the University who have hopes and dreams of a certain<br />\nkind There is in every class a percentage\u2014sometimes large, sometimes small\u2014<br />\nwho desire to win a name as writers and who are more than likely to consider<br />\nthat newspaper work offers a means to that end. These are the men I want to<br />\nreach and to them I merely wish to say:<br />\n\"Don't do it.\"<br />\n.<br />\nA man who enters the newspaper field with the idea of stepping thereby<br />\ninto literature or into the writing of history or any other sort of book-making<br />\nthat requires sustained attention to score success, will ultimately wake up to a<br />\nrealization that his cherished volume has not been written, nor, for that mat'er,<br />\nhas. any other volume been turne,1 out that adequately satisfies the ambitions<br />\nof its producer. Journalism is sometimes a stepping-stone to literature, but<br />\nmore often it is a set-back. It gives a man a living, it trains him to write with<br />\nfacility, but it exacts much of him. The hours of work, especially on a morning<br />\nnewspaper, are long, and then there are frequent emergency demands beyond<br />\nthis limit. How, then, is a man likely to find time to delve into literature,<br />\nexcept in a most dilettante way? After an arduous mental and physical strain<br />\nof ten, twelve or fourteen hours, is he in condition to do work whose promise<br />\nand whose originality will gain the approval of the gentlemen who read manuscripts for the magazines and the publishing houses? He may write, having<br />\nacquired ease and speed, but he can never hope to concentrate his spare time for<br />\nmonths upon something other than his work for the paper. The result is that<br />\nhis note in literature is but the feeblest pipe, unnoticed beyond a circle of friends<br />\nand leading to no enduring reputation.<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nI know that some will say that there are literary posts in connection with a<br />\nlarge daily newspaper. There are, for example, writers of editorials and of<br />\ndramatic criticisms, reviewers of books and writers of special articles of a semiliterary or semi-editorial character. While this is true, it is also obvious that<br />\nthe newspaper publisher is not going to engage youths just out of college to fill<br />\nany of these posts. In fact, I may go farther and lay it down as a principle<br />\nborn of long experience that the best men for all these posts are those who have<br />\nbeen \"through the mill,\" who have had their notions tempered by actual rubbing up against all things and all men and who have gained thereby a certain<br />\ndelicacy of newspaper touch that enables them to take the pulse of the public<br />\nand to weigh right and wrong, importance and insignificance, with the rapidity<br />\nof judgment which a daily paper requires. I know one exceptionally able editor<br />\nand one brilliant literary critic, neither of whom were ever reporters The critic<br />\nwas secured by the paper solely by reason of his exceptional aptitude for his<br />\nparticular work, and can do nothing else for the newspaper, while the editor has<br />\nconfessed to me that he feels he would be more valuable if he posses:ed the<br />\ninsight which reporting and editing alone can give.<br />\nIt is evident, then, that the chance of entering newspaper life other than as<br />\na reporter is about one in a hundred. The ninety-nine, therefore, can attain<br />\nthe desirable posts only by the route from the bottom. I think all of them will<br />\nconsider journalism \"one demned grind\" after two months. A wary city editor<br />\nis afraid to trust the raw hand on other than routine items, and even with these<br />\nit is annoying to be reminded that the point has been overlooked or that initials<br />\nare necessary for all names. After that, however, comes the insidiously attractive part of a reporter's life. He is \"assigned\" to stories\" of importance; he<br />\nrubs'elbows with fatuous men of city and State, and interviews distinguished<br />\nvisitors; he feels that he is behind the scenes while dozens of dramas are being<br />\nacted simultaneously, and he learns that the stage-manager is always more<br />\nimportant than the actors, while the scene-shifter is very likely to be so. He<br />\nis, in a word, an active and not unimportant participant in the full tide of human<br />\nlife, and though his work is arduous and his hours long,there is sufficient variety<br />\nin his assignments, day by day, to keep him always interested in his work and<br />\neager to do better than his rivals.<br />\nA newspaper office is, however, not entirely made up of reporters. There<br />\nmust be a corps of editors to do nothing but edit; men to plan what reporters<br />\nand correspondents shall do; men to go over, read, correct and dress up the<br />\nvolume of matter pouring in; men to take that edited copy, classify it by relative<br />\nimportance and interest, and to select the best for publication and \"make up\"<br />\nthe pages. None of these men, in a first-grade newspaper office, ever write<br />\nanything but head-lines and corrections. Their hours are long, often unusually<br />\nso, their work confining, often uninteresting. Probably nearly all of them<br />\nstarted into journalism to pass on to literature. They escaped the maelstrom<br />\nof the attractiveness of reporting only to find themselves engulfed in the vortex<br />\nof \"copy-reading,\" Their \"great book\" is not likely to be written unless they<br />\ntear themselves from newspaper work. And that is difficult to men of thirty or<br />\nmore, men probably with families dependent on their salaries.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nThis question of remuneration also suggests an additional warning. After<br />\na college man who has gone into newspaper work has become broken in, his salary<br />\nwill average from $800 to $1500 as a reporter, comparing more than favorably<br />\nwith the incomes of his classmates who have gone into other professions. If he<br />\nbecomes an editor, or an editorial writer, he will get from $1200 to $2000, and<br />\nthis, too, may be still better than his classmates are doing. But that is his<br />\nmaximum, and in eight or ten years the classmates, those who are ambitious<br />\nand successful, begin to forge ahead; as a rule, to stay ahead. The editor with<br />\na comfortable salary will stay an editor of modest means all his life. He has<br />\nnot the capital to branch out in the line whose details he has mastered, for it<br />\ntakes a big sum to start a daily paper. He has to be content with the praises<br />\nof those who employ him and those who know him. His work is hidden in the<br />\nanonymity of each issue of his journal. His ambitions are for the paper. He<br />\nbelongs to an honorable profession and he is respected, therefore, in the corn.<br />\nmunity.<br />\nBut he never writes that world-illumining volume if he continues to work<br />\nconscientiously as a newspaper man.<br />\nCHARLES WEATHERS BUMP, '92.<br />\n<br />\nINTERCLASS FOOTBALL.<br />\n<br />\na1<br />\n<br />\n,0 one will doubt but that the interclass football games played by the classes<br />\nof '92, '93 and '94 were beyond all expectations a great success, and if<br />\nby recalling them to mind after several years have elapsed, I can a'rouse<br />\nany enthusiasm along this line of University athletics, I shall have been fully<br />\ncompensated for the time spent in writing these few lines.<br />\nFor several years prior to '92 there had been class football teams, and they<br />\ncontinued to form a part of University athletics until after the freshman year of<br />\nthe class of '94. At this time they were abolished and a University team put in the<br />\nfield. These class teams aroused a great amount of college spirit, and in my humble opinion the formation of a University football team was directly traceable to<br />\ntheir organization. Class spirit and pride reached their culmination<br />\nin the clases of '92, '93 ' and '94, and when I think of the splendid<br />\ngames played, I wonder how it came about that we could procure three such<br />\nteams out of so small a number of students I do not believe the teams that<br />\nformed the Interclass League for the winter of '91-'92 have ever been equalled<br />\nin any university, certainly never in the history of the Hopkins. Of course I<br />\nmay be a more or less interested party, but I am sure the above is the general<br />\nopinion of those who know something of the history of these classes.<br />\nNearly everyone is familiar with the history of the exciting games by which<br />\n'93 became the champions of the J. H.; '92 and '94 fought furiously for the<br />\nlaurels, but were doomed to disappointment. There were but three games<br />\nPlayed, so that each class had a fair chance, and it hurt the pride of '92 to meet<br />\ndefeat at the hands of the Junior class. '94 had not much to lose, for she was<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ntoo young in University life to appreciate the significance of such an event. In<br />\nhonor of winning this championship, each member of the team of the class of<br />\n'93 was given as a trophy a golden football with his name and class engraved<br />\nupon it. These little charms are highly prized by the men holding them and<br />\nare afterward pointed to with much pride.<br />\nI have thus briefly given a mere outline of what has been done in class<br />\nathletics at the University. Why cannot this spirit again be revived? I<br />\ntrust that the day will come when each class, as it enters the University, will<br />\norganize for athletics with the same feeling with which it organizes for protection against hazing, and that we will be able to witness the enthusiasm of a<br />\ndecade ago.<br />\n<br />\nH.

The contests are scheduled<br />\nfor December 6 at American League Park. As usual, half a dozen tickets<br />\nwill be issued to each member of the two classes. Others wishing to secure<br />\ninvitations should apply to G. A.

The choice of the Hospital is, in addition, fortunate in that many<br />\nof the old grads and former players on the clubs, who are now at the Medical<br />\nSchool, drop in and generously bestow their criticism upon the players. It<br />\nmust be said, however, that the general result of the afternoon's work was<br />\ngood, and that the leaders have cause to hope\u2014which is about all that can be<br />\nexpected of a first attempt. The program was as follows:<br />\nGlee Club, University Ode, Devries, '89; Banjo Club, March Song from<br />\n\"The Show Girl;\" Mandolin Club, \"Imperial Edward March.\" Sousa; Glee<br />\nClub, 1902 medley, W.

With<br />\nappetites .sharpened by these innocent diversions, the crowd next attacked a<br />\nbountiful \"spread,\" and then retired to the rear to drink the health of the host<br />\nof the evening.

Moreover, from present indications it seems that a large<br />\nproportion of the college will be at the American League Park on Saturday,<br />\nto get in good training for the great fight on Thanksgiving day.<br />\nHowever, there are many men in the college who can help the team in a<br />\nmore direct way than by yelling at it, and who are not taking advantage of<br />\ntheir opportunity. These are the men who should be composing the scrub<br />\nteam. It has rarely happened this season that, in their afternoon practice, the<br />\n'Varsity players have had a second team to line up against, on which to try<br />\n<br />\nZ<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE N EWS- LETT8R.<br />\ntheir plays. This is but a poor state of affairs. There are plenty of men who<br />\ncould make their class teams, and who have some knowledge of football, who<br />\nare failing in their duty to the college, merely because they see no direct reward<br />\nfor the exertion of coming out every afternoon and being rolled around by the<br />\n'Varsity players. It should need no second thought to show that there is as<br />\nlittle truth in such reasoning as there is honor in such a position. Although<br />\nthe 'Varsity team is now made up, supposedly, of the best players that can<br />\nPossibly be secured from the college and Medical School, still it is the interest<br />\nand pride of every student to do all in his power to make them steadily better.<br />\nAnd if it is in his power to give such active help as practising with the regular<br />\nteam, and if he does this faithfully, he will certainly deserve and obtain a<br />\nrespect and popularity among his fellow-students which cannot be measured<br />\nby formal athletic honors. Every man who is able ought to get out his football clothes every afternoon during the week that remains before Thanksgiving,<br />\nand show some practical evidence of his gratitude to his Alma Mater.<br />\n<br />\n4 40N to Homewood!\" is still the cry. And it is being taken up by new<br />\nvoices. The decision as to the dividing line between the University<br />\ngrounds and the new city park settles an important question. Mr. Brent<br />\nKeyser, in supplying funds for the survey, is enabling us to get an idea as to how<br />\nour future temples of learning are to be placed. The latest agitation on the movement, however, is one which peculiarly interests the undergraduates, since it<br />\nmust be carried out by them alone,\u2014 namely, the plan of a college dormitory,<br />\nto be built by Hopkins undergraduates by means of the dime savings-bank<br />\nsystem. It is astonishing how soon the dimes received in small change will<br />\ngrow into the $5.00 which fills the bank; little burden would be experienced in<br />\nsubscribing, say, $10.00 a year, even by those of least means. It is easy to cal<br />\nciliate that 150 students, each giving $10.00 per year, would in the course of six<br />\nyears accumulate the sum of $9,000, which with compound interest, would<br />\napproach $10,000. And this sum would be sufficient to erect a college dormitory at Homewood which would be a splendid memorial to the college<br />\nstudents of the J. H. U. from '02 to '08. As to the supervision of the matter,<br />\nthe four class treasurers could form a perpetual committee to collect the money<br />\nand take charge of the deposit. To start this movement would be an achievement of which the present college could always feel proud, and with good<br />\nreason.<br />\n<br />\nT has been thought advisable that the vacancy of assistant athletic editor on<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nTHu NHWS-LF,TTRR board should be filled, if possible, by a member of the<br />\nclass of '04. All candidates should hand in accounts of the M. A.

Hopkins won the toss, and decided to defend the<br />\nwest goal.<br />\nRoberts kicked off for Western Maryland. Strohbar received the ball and<br />\nadvanced it 10 yards. Miller made a run around right end for 15 yards, but at<br />\nthis point Western Maryland braced up and secured the ball on downs.<br />\nThe college boys played hard, but a fumble gave Yearley the opportunity<br />\nthe ball for Hopkins. A series of fine runs by Blanck, Houghton and<br />\nsecure<br />\nto<br />\nMiller carried the ball to Western Maryland's 20-yard line. Hopkins then lost<br />\nit on downs, but Maryland was forced to kick after being held for two downs.<br />\nStrohbar caught the ball, and by a beautiful run around right end advanced<br />\nthe ball to the 15-yard line. Blanck was pushed through several times, and<br />\nfinally, after a hard plunge, scored the first touchdown. He also kicked goal,<br />\nand after 18 minutes of play the score stood 6 to 0 in favor of Hopkins. The<br />\nremaining two minutes of the first half were spent in struggles which left the<br />\nball in the center of the field.<br />\nHopkins kicked off in the second half, and the ball was downed on the 10yard line. Western Maryland kept the ball most of the time, and fifteen seconds before the end of the game Roberts was pushed over for a touchdown near<br />\nthe side lines. After a long and serious argument, Spalding's \"Manual\" prevailed, and the ball was punted out, successfully heeled, and Roberts kicked<br />\ngoal, making the score 6 to 6.<br />\nTen seconds remained, and on the first down after the kick-off, time was<br />\ncalled and the contest was over.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nThe game was snappy and full of spirit from start to finish. The end runs<br />\nand rushes made by Blanck, Miller and Stone were fine. In fact, these three<br />\nbacks did nearly all the work of advancing the ball. Strohbar at quarterback<br />\ncontributed largely to Hopkins' success. Thanks to his accuracy, Hopkins did<br />\nnot make a fumble throughout the entire game.

HANDLER.<br />\n<br />\nHERE was once a well-meaning philanthropist who took a bath every<br />\nmorning and employed a clerk to figure out his income. One hot summer<br />\n. day he sat in the shade of a venerable oak watching a house which was<br />\nbeing built across the street from his home. He was waiting for his coachman<br />\nto bring around his high-steppers, for that afternoon he intended to arouse some<br />\ndust and some envy on the speedway.<br />\nAs he watched the sons of Ham carry the brick up the ladder he fell into a<br />\nPonder, and from the ponder he fell into a soliloquy. \"How much happier,\"<br />\nquoth he, \"are these men than I. How much they are to be envied. Behold!<br />\nthey have the digestion of an ostrich and the sleep of a little child.\" Here he<br />\nheaved a sigh such as we are accustomed to hear on the stage. Growing bolder,<br />\nhe advanced to one of the blackamoors who happened to be enjoying a short<br />\nrest in the shade, and addressed him thus:<br />\n\"0 bow much better your lot is than mine! You know the joy of walking,<br />\nwhile I\u2014I have to go whithersoever my coachman listeth. You eat whatever<br />\nyour good wife puts into your till bucket, while I\u2014I find the things prepared<br />\nby my French chef pall upon me.

But the philanthropist continued his Sunday school con,<br />\nmuch after this fashion :<br />\n\"See how gcod it is to labor. Verily I say unto you, if I or some of my<br />\nfellows could carry your hod for you and enjoy your peace, willingly would our<br />\ndollars be rained upon you in recompense.\"<br />\nThe man who worked eight hours a day for one twenty-five could stand it<br />\nno longer.<br />\n\"Look a heall, man, don' you know I'se willin' to trade?

And yet you sez I've a good thing.\"<br />\nBut the philanthropist stcod up for his pet theory. For the last time he<br />\nsighed.<br />\n\"How happy one of my station would be if he could trade his dollars for<br />\nyour contentment. Only,\" he added sadly, \"he would not have the strength<br />\nto hold up the hod.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f14<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n\"Don' let dat worry you,\" said the dusky son of toil. \"Ef any ob dem<br />\nbillionaires wants ter trade der dollars fer my hod, jes let 'em come eroun'.

I didn't need to be told.<br />\n\"I've been paintin', sah,\" Walter remarked at last when he saw that I was<br />\nblissfully oblivious to my surroundings. I opened one eye and looked at him.<br />\nAfter examining him closely I calmly closed my eye and ventured to state that<br />\nI saw no traces of it, that he still preserved that healthy brown color which I so<br />\nadmired. \"If that is nature, Walter,\" I said, \"it is good, but if it is art, it is<br />\nmuch better.\"<br />\nIf ever Walter came near cutting my throat that was the time. When he<br />\nhad gained control of his feelings he remonstrated. \"Law! sah, I ain't been<br />\npaintin' myself, but the shop, sah.

There had been efforts to establish one, in two of which I took<br />\npart, but the faculty was not then in the mood and we applied in vain for<br />\nPermission to go ahead. Even our much-loved class annual, the first of the Hullabaloos, had many trials and tribulations before we finally produced it upon the<br />\nstage of Un:versity life. This little foreword in a reminiscential vein is only<br />\npenned because it serves to measure my gratification at the success which has<br />\nattained the publication of THE NEWS- LETTVR. I have always held to the theory<br />\nthat a college paper, well-edited, may become a valuable aid in the development<br />\nOf that 'varsity spirit which seems essential to the growth and popularity of an<br />\ninstitution like the Johns Hopkins. This, I feel sure, has been proven by THE<br /><br />\nNEWS LETTER.<br />\nI have been asked to write something for this issue of THE NEws-LETTER.<br />\ncan think of nothing better than to contribute a leaf out of my own story as a<br />\nw.arning to some now in the University who have hopes and dreams of a certain<br />\nkind There is in every class a percentage\u2014sometimes large, sometimes small\u2014<br />\nwho desire to win a name as writers and who are more than likely to consider<br />\nthat newspaper work offers a means to that end. These are the men I want to<br />\nreach and to them I merely wish to say:<br />\n\"Don't do it.\"<br />\n.<br />\nA man who enters the newspaper field with the idea of stepping thereby<br />\ninto literature or into the writing of history or any other sort of book-making<br />\nthat requires sustained attention to score success, will ultimately wake up to a<br />\nrealization that his cherished volume has not been written, nor, for that mat'er,<br />\nhas. any other volume been turne,1 out that adequately satisfies the ambitions<br />\nof its producer. Journalism is sometimes a stepping-stone to literature, but<br />\nmore often it is a set-back. It gives a man a living, it trains him to write with<br />\nfacility, but it exacts much of him. The hours of work, especially on a morning<br />\nnewspaper, are long, and then there are frequent emergency demands beyond<br />\nthis limit. How, then, is a man likely to find time to delve into literature,<br />\nexcept in a most dilettante way? After an arduous mental and physical strain<br />\nof ten, twelve or fourteen hours, is he in condition to do work whose promise<br />\nand whose originality will gain the approval of the gentlemen who read manuscripts for the magazines and the publishing houses? He may write, having<br />\nacquired ease and speed, but he can never hope to concentrate his spare time for<br />\nmonths upon something other than his work for the paper. The result is that<br />\nhis note in literature is but the feeblest pipe, unnoticed beyond a circle of friends<br />\nand leading to no enduring reputation.<br />\nI<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nI know that some will say that there are literary posts in connection with a<br />\nlarge daily newspaper. There are, for example, writers of editorials and of<br />\ndramatic criticisms, reviewers of books and writers of special articles of a semiliterary or semi-editorial character. While this is true, it is also obvious that<br />\nthe newspaper publisher is not going to engage youths just out of college to fill<br />\nany of these posts. In fact, I may go farther and lay it down as a principle<br />\nborn of long experience that the best men for all these posts are those who have<br />\nbeen \"through the mill,\" who have had their notions tempered by actual rubbing up against all things and all men and who have gained thereby a certain<br />\ndelicacy of newspaper touch that enables them to take the pulse of the public<br />\nand to weigh right and wrong, importance and insignificance, with the rapidity<br />\nof judgment which a daily paper requires. I know one exceptionally able editor<br />\nand one brilliant literary critic, neither of whom were ever reporters The critic<br />\nwas secured by the paper solely by reason of his exceptional aptitude for his<br />\nparticular work, and can do nothing else for the newspaper, while the editor has<br />\nconfessed to me that he feels he would be more valuable if he posses:ed the<br />\ninsight which reporting and editing alone can give.<br />\nIt is evident, then, that the chance of entering newspaper life other than as<br />\na reporter is about one in a hundred. The ninety-nine, therefore, can attain<br />\nthe desirable posts only by the route from the bottom. I think all of them will<br />\nconsider journalism \"one demned grind\" after two months. A wary city editor<br />\nis afraid to trust the raw hand on other than routine items, and even with these<br />\nit is annoying to be reminded that the point has been overlooked or that initials<br />\nare necessary for all names. After that, however, comes the insidiously attractive part of a reporter's life. He is \"assigned\" to stories\" of importance; he<br />\nrubs'elbows with fatuous men of city and State, and interviews distinguished<br />\nvisitors; he feels that he is behind the scenes while dozens of dramas are being<br />\nacted simultaneously, and he learns that the stage-manager is always more<br />\nimportant than the actors, while the scene-shifter is very likely to be so. He<br />\nis, in a word, an active and not unimportant participant in the full tide of human<br />\nlife, and though his work is arduous and his hours long,there is sufficient variety<br />\nin his assignments, day by day, to keep him always interested in his work and<br />\neager to do better than his rivals.<br />\nA newspaper office is, however, not entirely made up of reporters. There<br />\nmust be a corps of editors to do nothing but edit; men to plan what reporters<br />\nand correspondents shall do; men to go over, read, correct and dress up the<br />\nvolume of matter pouring in; men to take that edited copy, classify it by relative<br />\nimportance and interest, and to select the best for publication and \"make up\"<br />\nthe pages. None of these men, in a first-grade newspaper office, ever write<br />\nanything but head-lines and corrections. Their hours are long, often unusually<br />\nso, their work confining, often uninteresting. Probably nearly all of them<br />\nstarted into journalism to pass on to literature. They escaped the maelstrom<br />\nof the attractiveness of reporting only to find themselves engulfed in the vortex<br />\nof \"copy-reading,\" Their \"great book\" is not likely to be written unless they<br />\ntear themselves from newspaper work. And that is difficult to men of thirty or<br />\nmore, men probably with families dependent on their salaries.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nThis question of remuneration also suggests an additional warning. After<br />\na college man who has gone into newspaper work has become broken in, his salary<br />\nwill average from $800 to $1500 as a reporter, comparing more than favorably<br />\nwith the incomes of his classmates who have gone into other professions. If he<br />\nbecomes an editor, or an editorial writer, he will get from $1200 to $2000, and<br />\nthis, too, may be still better than his classmates are doing. But that is his<br />\nmaximum, and in eight or ten years the classmates, those who are ambitious<br />\nand successful, begin to forge ahead; as a rule, to stay ahead. The editor with<br />\na comfortable salary will stay an editor of modest means all his life. He has<br />\nnot the capital to branch out in the line whose details he has mastered, for it<br />\ntakes a big sum to start a daily paper. He has to be content with the praises<br />\nof those who employ him and those who know him. His work is hidden in the<br />\nanonymity of each issue of his journal. His ambitions are for the paper. He<br />\nbelongs to an honorable profession and he is respected, therefore, in the corn.<br />\nmunity.<br />\nBut he never writes that world-illumining volume if he continues to work<br />\nconscientiously as a newspaper man.<br />\nCHARLES WEATHERS BUMP, '92.<br /><br />\nINTERCLASS FOOTBALL.<br /><br />\na1<br /><br />\n,0 one will doubt but that the interclass football games played by the classes<br />\nof '92, '93 and '94 were beyond all expectations a great success, and if<br />\nby recalling them to mind after several years have elapsed, I can a'rouse<br />\nany enthusiasm along this line of University athletics, I shall have been fully<br />\ncompensated for the time spent in writing these few lines.<br />\nFor several years prior to '92 there had been class football teams, and they<br />\ncontinued to form a part of University athletics until after the freshman year of<br />\nthe class of '94. At this time they were abolished and a University team put in the<br />\nfield. These class teams aroused a great amount of college spirit, and in my humble opinion the formation of a University football team was directly traceable to<br />\ntheir organization. Class spirit and pride reached their culmination<br />\nin the clases of '92, '93 ' and '94, and when I think of the splendid<br />\ngames played, I wonder how it came about that we could procure three such<br />\nteams out of so small a number of students I do not believe the teams that<br />\nformed the Interclass League for the winter of '91-'92 have ever been equalled<br />\nin any university, certainly never in the history of the Hopkins. Of course I<br />\nmay be a more or less interested party, but I am sure the above is the general<br />\nopinion of those who know something of the history of these classes.<br />\nNearly everyone is familiar with the history of the exciting games by which<br />\n'93 became the champions of the J.

We congratulate the readers of THE NEWS-LETTER on having such an able intro<br />\nduction to this timely subject.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE support given the football team by the college men and some faithful<br />\ngrads. was very gratifying at the Westminster game. The number and<br />\nspirit of the rooters was good, and there is no doubt that their vigorous<br />\nand well-trained songs and war-cries helped the team to render so good an account of themselves. Moreover, from present indications it seems that a large<br />\nproportion of the college will be at the American League Park on Saturday,<br />\nto get in good training for the great fight on Thanksgiving day.<br />\nHowever, there are many men in the college who can help the team in a<br />\nmore direct way than by yelling at it, and who are not taking advantage of<br />\ntheir opportunity. These are the men who should be composing the scrub<br />\nteam. It has rarely happened this season that, in their afternoon practice, the<br />\n'Varsity players have had a second team to line up against, on which to try<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nTHE N EWS- LETT8R.<br />\ntheir plays. This is but a poor state of affairs. There are plenty of men who<br />\ncould make their class teams, and who have some knowledge of football, who<br />\nare failing in their duty to the college, merely because they see no direct reward<br />\nfor the exertion of coming out every afternoon and being rolled around by the<br />\n'Varsity players. It should need no second thought to show that there is as<br />\nlittle truth in such reasoning as there is honor in such a position. Although<br />\nthe 'Varsity team is now made up, supposedly, of the best players that can<br />\nPossibly be secured from the college and Medical School, still it is the interest<br />\nand pride of every student to do all in his power to make them steadily better.<br />\nAnd if it is in his power to give such active help as practising with the regular<br />\nteam, and if he does this faithfully, he will certainly deserve and obtain a<br />\nrespect and popularity among his fellow-students which cannot be measured<br />\nby formal athletic honors. Every man who is able ought to get out his football clothes every afternoon during the week that remains before Thanksgiving,<br />\nand show some practical evidence of his gratitude to his Alma Mater.<br /><br />\n4 40N to Homewood!\" is still the cry. And it is being taken up by new<br />\nvoices. The decision as to the dividing line between the University<br />\ngrounds and the new city park settles an important question. Mr. Brent<br />\nKeyser, in supplying funds for the survey, is enabling us to get an idea as to how<br />\nour future temples of learning are to be placed. The latest agitation on the movement, however, is one which peculiarly interests the undergraduates, since it<br />\nmust be carried out by them alone,\u2014 namely, the plan of a college dormitory,<br />\nto be built by Hopkins undergraduates by means of the dime savings-bank<br />\nsystem. It is astonishing how soon the dimes received in small change will<br />\ngrow into the $5.00 which fills the bank; little burden would be experienced in<br />\nsubscribing, say, $10.00 a year, even by those of least means. It is easy to cal<br />\nciliate that 150 students, each giving $10.00 per year, would in the course of six<br />\nyears accumulate the sum of $9,000, which with compound interest, would<br />\napproach $10,000. And this sum would be sufficient to erect a college dormitory at Homewood which would be a splendid memorial to the college<br />\nstudents of the J. H. U. from '02 to '08. As to the supervision of the matter,<br />\nthe four class treasurers could form a perpetual committee to collect the money<br />\nand take charge of the deposit. To start this movement would be an achievement of which the present college could always feel proud, and with good<br />\nreason.<br /><br />\nT has been thought advisable that the vacancy of assistant athletic editor on<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nTHu NHWS-LF,TTRR board should be filled, if possible, by a member of the<br />\nclass of '04.

Hopkins won the toss, and decided to defend the<br />\nwest goal.<br />\nRoberts kicked off for Western Maryland. Strohbar received the ball and<br />\nadvanced it 10 yards. Miller made a run around right end for 15 yards, but at<br />\nthis point Western Maryland braced up and secured the ball on downs.<br />\nThe college boys played hard, but a fumble gave Yearley the opportunity<br />\nthe ball for Hopkins. A series of fine runs by Blanck, Houghton and<br />\nsecure<br />\nto<br />\nMiller carried the ball to Western Maryland's 20-yard line. Hopkins then lost<br />\nit on downs, but Maryland was forced to kick after being held for two downs.<br />\nStrohbar caught the ball, and by a beautiful run around right end advanced<br />\nthe ball to the 15-yard line. Blanck was pushed through several times, and<br />\nfinally, after a hard plunge, scored the first touchdown. He also kicked goal,<br />\nand after 18 minutes of play the score stood 6 to 0 in favor of Hopkins. The<br />\nremaining two minutes of the first half were spent in struggles which left the<br />\nball in the center of the field.<br />\nHopkins kicked off in the second half, and the ball was downed on the 10yard line. Western Maryland kept the ball most of the time, and fifteen seconds before the end of the game Roberts was pushed over for a touchdown near<br />\nthe side lines. After a long and serious argument, Spalding's \"Manual\" prevailed, and the ball was punted out, successfully heeled, and Roberts kicked<br />\ngoal, making the score 6 to 6.<br />\nTen seconds remained, and on the first down after the kick-off, time was<br />\ncalled and the contest was over.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nThe game was snappy and full of spirit from start to finish.

HANDLER.<br /><br />\nHERE was once a well-meaning philanthropist who took a bath every<br />\nmorning and employed a clerk to figure out his income. One hot summer<br />\n. day he sat in the shade of a venerable oak watching a house which was<br />\nbeing built across the street from his home. He was waiting for his coachman<br />\nto bring around his high-steppers, for that afternoon he intended to arouse some<br />\ndust and some envy on the speedway.<br />\nAs he watched the sons of Ham carry the brick up the ladder he fell into a<br />\nPonder, and from the ponder he fell into a soliloquy. \"How much happier,\"<br />\nquoth he, \"are these men than I. How much they are to be envied. Behold!<br />\nthey have the digestion of an ostrich and the sleep of a little child.\" Here he<br />\nheaved a sigh such as we are accustomed to hear on the stage. Growing bolder,<br />\nhe advanced to one of the blackamoors who happened to be enjoying a short<br />\nrest in the shade, and addressed him thus:<br />\n\"0 bow much better your lot is than mine! You know the joy of walking,<br />\nwhile I\u2014I have to go whithersoever my coachman listeth. You eat whatever<br />\nyour good wife puts into your till bucket, while I\u2014I find the things prepared<br />\nby my French chef pall upon me.

For the last time he<br />\nsighed.<br />\n\"How happy one of my station would be if he could trade his dollars for<br />\nyour contentment. Only,\" he added sadly, \"he would not have the strength<br />\nto hold up the hod.\"<br /><br />\n14<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n\"Don' let dat worry you,\" said the dusky son of toil. \"Ef any ob dem<br />\nbillionaires wants ter trade der dollars fer my hod, jes let 'em come eroun'.

I let him explain.<br />\n'`Ef we'd been a-playin' on a billiard table insted of on .the side of a<br />\nmountain, sah, thar'd been nothin' doin'. You see, it was this way.'' Here<br />\nWalter made a dramatic sweep with his razor which threatened to decapitate me.<br />\n\"It's jest like this, sah. Here's the side of the hill, here's them fellers, here's<br />\nthe ball, and here we is. What next?\" Walter backed off and looked at me<br />\nquestioningly while he made an impressive oratorical pause. \"What next?<br />\nWhat made'm tie that score? Gravity, sah, gravity. You know that things are<br />\nboun' to roll down hill. That ball jest had to come down. Them fellers didn't<br />\ntie the score; it was gravity, sah, gravity.\"<br />\nThere was an impressive silence, broken only by the rasping sound which<br />\ntold the loafers in the barber shop that Walter was giving me a close shave for<br />\nSunday. I didn't need to be told.<br />\n\"I've been paintin', sah,\" Walter remarked at last when he saw that I was<br />\nblissfully oblivious to my surroundings. I opened one eye and looked at him.<br />\nAfter examining him closely I calmly closed my eye and ventured to state that<br />\nI saw no traces of it, that he still preserved that healthy brown color which I so<br />\nadmired. \"If that is nature, Walter,\" I said, \"it is good, but if it is art, it is<br />\nmuch better.\"<br />\nIf ever Walter came near cutting my throat that was the time. When he<br />\nhad gained control of his feelings he remonstrated. \"Law! sah, I ain't been<br />\npaintin' myself, but the shop, sah. Can't you smell it?\"<br />\n\"I have detected a peculiar odor, Walter,\" I replied, \"but I thought that<br />\nit was only your famous elixir for denuded roofs, otherwise known as hair-oil.\"<br />\n\"What, sah, what! Ef you would use some of my hair restorer, it would<br />\ndo you good.\"<br />\n\"Then why don't you use it, Walter?\"<br />\n\"It's no use, sah,\" he answered, sadly shaking his head, \"it's no use<br />\nHair restorer can't help my bald head My wife done took all my hair out<br />\nbefore I invented my hair-oil \"<br />\nWalter seemed to stand in need of consolation, but just then the bell rang<br />\nand I fled.<br /><br />\nTHE NURSE\u2014They're twins, sir.<br />\nYOUNG HUSBAND\u2014And I told her we must begin in a small way.\u2014Life.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\nSONGS FOR THE BLEACHERS.<br />\n(AIR : The (good ON Summer Time.)<br />\nIn the good old football time,<br />\nIn the good old football time,<br />\nBowling 'way around the ends,<br />\nSmashing through the line;<br />\nWe hold the ball, they can't hold at all,<br />\nAnd that's a very good sign<br />\nThat there's a gain for Hopkins<br />\nIn the good old football time.<br />\nMr. Dooley.)<br />\nOh, Uncle Daniel<br />\nAnd Uncle Ira,<br />\nThe greatest Prexs. the Hopkins ever knew;<br />\nSo diplomatic,<br />\nAnd so emphatic,<br />\nIs Uncle Dan and Uncle Ira too.<br /><br />\n(.1IR :<br /><br />\nOh, Mr. Garwood!<br />\nOh, Mr. Garwood!<br />\nThe finest coach the Hopkins ever knew,<br />\nHe keeps'em moving,<br />\nAlways improving,<br />\nDoes Mr. Garwood of the J.
