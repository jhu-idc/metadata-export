Going to press five times<br />\nper year, the journal has the purpose to represent the major<br />\nmodern languages; and, according to Macksey, the journal<br />\n\"was but one enduring manifestation of President Gilman's program to translate the European<br />\nhigher learning to this country<br />\nand its own historical aspirations.\"<br />\nAs concerns the delegations,<br />\nMacksey declared, \"I hope there<br />\nwill be some discussion across<br />\ndisciplinary lines.\" Similar conferences have been known to have<br />\nshown a lack of \"transdisciplinary dialogue,\" a difficulty the<br />\nprofessor intends to avoid.

In an unexpected move, George Fisher, dean of the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences and Matthew<br />\nCrenson, associate dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences, suddenly announced their plans<br />\nto resign from the administration at the end<br />\nof this academic year.<br />\nThe two deans apparently made their<br />\ndecision to resign in order to return to<br />\nteaching and research, in good Hopkins<br />\nform.<br />\nThe resignation of any dean is certainly<br />\ngrounds for some interest and concern. But<br />\nthe simultaneous resignation fo Fisher and<br />\nCrenson is, without a doubt, one of the<br />\nmost important administrative changes to<br />\noccur at Homewood in recent years.<br />\nAs the top men in the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences (the largest academic division at<br />\nHomewood), Fisher and Crenson have<br />\ndone an excellent job in directing and coordinating a vast array of academic departments. Furthermore, both deans have been<br />\nremarkably accessible and eager to work<br />\nwith students.<br />\nIt's difficult to single out any specific<br />\nachievement exclusively attributable to the<br />\nwork of the departing deans. However, that<br />\nprobably is as it should be. After all, the<br />\nmark of many good and efficient administrators is the lack of a distinctive<br />\n<br />\nmark.<br />\nAs the shock of the resignations abates,<br />\nthoughts must turn to the future of the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences. Soon a search<br />\nwill be underway to find a successor to<br />\nFisher. The administration should keep two<br />\nthings in mind as it begins looking for a new<br />\ndean.<br />\nFirst, students ought to be given a voice<br />\nin the selection process. No dean has a<br />\nmore profound and lasting effect on the<br />\nacademic prestige of the University than the<br />\ndean of the School of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nHis decisions directly affect students and<br />\nwhat they study. It seems appropriate,<br />\ntherefore, that students should be given<br />\nsome input in the selection of such a new<br />\ndean.<br />\nSecond, the selection process ought to be<br />\ntargetted to an individual who will be willing to devote many years to the Homewood<br />\nadministration. Developing the necessary<br />\ncontacts and inside working knowledge of<br />\nan institution as complicated as Hopkins<br />\ntakes years. It's a long-term<br />\ncommitment\u2014not the kind of job that<br />\nshould be tracked for a rapid turn-over.<br />\nFisher and Crenson will certainly and<br />\nrightfully be missed in the Homewood administration next year. We only hope that<br />\na prudent selection process will result in the<br />\nhiring of equally competent successors.<br />\n<br />\nAt the Bottom of the Pack<br />\nTwo weeks ago, an Ad Hoc Faculty<br />\nPlanning Committee issued a long-awaited<br />\nreport on the status of the M.S.E. Library.<br />\nThe report, which was eighteen months in<br />\nthe making, concluded that the library<br />\n\"faces serious problems within its collections, a shortage of personnel\u2014particularly<br />\nbibliographers\u2014and pressing short-term<br />\nand long-term space requirements.\" Even<br />\nan eighteen minute walk through M.S.E.<br />\ndramatically confirms those conclusions.<br />\nFor the very few among us who haven't<br />\nhad the occasion to visit the library recently, two observations are striking. First, the<br />\nstacks are jammed full. There is often so<br />\nlittle room on a shelf that stackers resort<br />\nto cramming books into little crevices on<br />\ntop of other books. Second, the books that<br />\nare available (with the exception of scientific texts) are often hopelessly out of date.<br />\nYou may be able to find an eighteenth century printing of Moliere, but good luck<br />\nsearching for something as 'exotic' as<br />\nVonnegut.<br />\nThese two observations point to two of<br />\nthe most serious problems addressed in the<br />\nFaculty Planning Committee's report\u2014<br />\nnamely the shortage of space and the<br />\nmiserable acquisition track-record of<br />\nM.S.E.<br />\nCurrently, the library is full and has<br />\nessentially been so since the mid 1970's.<br />\nOverflow, until now, has been managed by<br />\nmoving books into the Gilman stacks for<br />\nstorage. But within two or three years, even<br />\nthat overflow space will be exhaused and<br />\npossibly reduced in size due to upcoming<br />\nrenovations to Gilman. Eventually, plans<br />\ncall for converting Rowland Hall into additional stack space. But even liberal<br />\nestimates suggest that such a change<br />\ncouldn't be finished at least until the early<br />\nor mid 1990's.<br />\n<br />\nThese space limitations put the library in<br />\na difficult position to be sure. But what is<br />\nastonishing is the failure of the University<br />\nhistorically to do anything to correct the<br />\nproblem.<br />\nNew books are, of course, the second<br />\nmajor problem addressed by the Faculty<br />\nPlanning Committee's report. According to<br />\nthe report, among fourteen comparable<br />\nlibraries which belong to the Association<br />\nof Research Libraries, Hopkins ranks thirteenth in the acquisition rate of new books.<br />\nAmong the 106 member ARL libraries,<br />\nHopkins ranks 101. Any way you slice it,<br />\nthe M.S.E. Library comes out at the very<br />\nbottom of the pack.<br />\nUndoubtedly, part of the reason for<br />\nHopkins' shortcomings in acquisitions is the<br />\nfact that there will soon be nowhere to put<br />\nadditional titles. Nevertheless, Hopkins'<br />\nmiserable acquisition rate cannot be simply glossed over. Already, some departments<br />\nhave indicated that their programs are suffering from a lack of literary resources. If<br />\nthose claims are true, and they probably<br />\nare, the University should be outraged.<br />\nNo top-rated prestigious research institution can function without a top-rated<br />\nprestigious library. If Hopkins is indeed<br />\ndedicated to the acquisition and disemination of knowledge, it needs to make a much<br />\nstronger commitment to the improvement<br />\nof the M.S.E. Library. Specifically, more<br />\nspace needs to be built, more books need<br />\nto be bought, and more bibliographers need<br />\nto be hired.<br />\nNone of these suggestions is easy and all<br />\nare expensive. But if Hopkins intends to retain its reputation of academic excellence,<br />\nit needs to devote inordinate resources and<br />\nattention to the M.S.E. Library during the<br />\nnext few years.<br />\n<br />\nbrutally<br />\nfrank<br />\nLoyal legions of readers<br />\nnumber 12 million.

Among the correlations observed by Thatcher<br />\nand Fishbein was that between<br />\nmean lead burden (as measured in<br />\nhair) and low I.Q.. That is, the<br />\nlowest achievers had the highest<br />\nlead burden.<br />\nPerhaps those individuals who<br />\nlived in housing contaminated<br />\nwith lead paint, who were<br />\nmalnourished, and who lived in<br />\nhigh traffic zones with much lead<br />\n<br />\npollution are the most at risk for<br />\npoor job performance and crimininality.. If blacks fit into this<br />\ncategory they are the victims of<br />\nour environment and society. One<br />\ncannot infer from the work of<br />\nGordon and Gottfredson any<br />\ndeeper significance about blacks<br />\nas a group. The danger of uncritical interpretation of the work<br />\nof Gordon and Gottfredson is that<br />\nit can so easily be twisted to<br />\nsatisfy a bigoted and racist point<br />\nof view.<br />\nRuth Aranow<br />\nThe writer is a member of the<br />\nChemistry Department<br />\n<br />\nClarifying IQ's<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nJoseph Gergyes is to be commended for presenting a factual<br />\nand unsensationalized account of<br />\nresearch by Dr. Linda Gottfredson and me on the non-educational consequences of group differences in IQ. The black-white<br />\ndifference is merely one example<br />\nof many such group differences.<br />\nIt happens to be of special interest<br />\nbecause it is one of the larger<br />\ngroup differences, and hence has<br />\nbeen subjected to more research<br />\nover a longer time in the U.S.<br />\nStudents have a special need to<br />\ninform themselves about research<br />\nin this area for two reasons. First,<br />\njudging from its stability over the<br />\npast 60 years, the black-white difference is likely to be with us for<br />\nsome time to come. Second, the<br />\nconsequences of the difference<br />\nare neither limited to school contexts nor trivial. Hence, students<br />\nof both races will furnish the<br />\nleaders of tomorrow who must<br />\ngrapple with problems of our<br />\nmulti-racial society.<br />\nUnfortunately, too much of the<br />\nteaching at our best universities<br />\nmisattributes racial problems in<br />\nways that serve only to undermine appreciation for the tremendous strides made by Americans<br />\nover the past two decades toward<br />\nremoving artificial racial barriers.<br />\nThose barriers to equality that<br />\nstill remain seem to be of a different sort altogether, and we are<br />\nnot equipped either ideologically<br />\nor scientifically for confronting<br />\nthem honestly.

Faidley<br />\n<br />\nStomaching Free Speech<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOn Tuesday, October 14th, I<br />\nwas in attendance at the third of<br />\nfour informal dialogues between<br />\nTrustees and students on the subject of divestment. It was soon apparent that I was the only nonCoalition student present. Discussion was nevertheless spirited and<br />\nlively. But then, upon raising my<br />\nhand to be recognized, a Coalition member leaned over my<br />\nshoulder and explained that this<br />\nmeeting was really just for the<br />\nCoalition to speak with the<br />\nTrustees, and that the Coalition,<br />\nwith the cooperation of the<br />\nTrustees. had already decided<br />\n<br />\nupon who was to speak, and that<br />\nunfortunately I could not be one<br />\nof these. It is obvious that what<br />\nI was told by this Coalition<br />\nmember was not at all the design<br />\nof the Trustees, as I was soon<br />\ncalled upon.<br />\nNonetheless, I would like to<br />\nask the Coalition for whom they<br />\nespouse \"freedom of expression.\" The dialogue I attended<br />\nwas meant to be an open forum.<br />\nIt appears that the Coalition does<br />\nnot have quite the respect for<br />\nfreedom of speech that it claims<br />\nto champion when the speech is<br />\nnot their own. Let me make it<br />\nclear that I regard apartheid with<br />\nthe same degree of disgust as<br />\nmost of the Hopkins community,<br />\nincluding the Coalition. It was<br />\nassumed that because I am not a<br />\nCoalition member, I do not support divestment. The fact is that<br />\nthe Coalition was correct. I do not<br />\nsupport divestment, but I ask: is<br />\nthe mark of a tolerant attitude an<br />\nattempt to prevent opponents<br />\nfrom speaking? Many of us have<br />\nbeen forced to suffer the Coalition's shanty in regard for free<br />\nspeech.

The tone and complete lack of logic expressed are<br />\nequally appalling. Mr. Bernstein<br />\nstates in the Oct. 3 News-Letter<br />\n<br />\nthat in the past the University has<br />\nalways allowed the Jewish students to build a sukkah on campus and argues that this practice<br />\nis \"threatened\" by \"haphazard\"<br />\nand \"irresponsible statements\"<br />\nmade by the Coalition. To perceive the Coalition's stand against<br />\nthe University's ban on unauthorized structures as a threat is absurd. The real threat is clearly<br />\nposed by the University ban<br />\nitself. Not content to confine his<br />\nargument to campus politics, Mr.<br />\nBernstein explores the realm of<br />\nConstitutional Law yet remains<br />\nunable to comprehend how<br />\nanyone could possible equate<br />\nreligious with political freedoms,<br />\ndespite the fact that both of these<br />\nfreedoms seem to have been<br />\nequally worthy of protection in<br />\nthe eyes of the Founding Fathers.<br />\nFinally one is faced with the<br />\nparanoid indignation of Mr.<br />\nLippe(News-Letter Oct. 10), who<br />\nwas concerned with what might<br />\nhave been. . I find Mr. Lippe's<br />\nself-centered posture particularly<br />\noffensive given the context of the<br />\nRosh Hashanah observance,<br />\nwhich celebrates the Jewish New<br />\nYear as a time of thanksgiving.<br />\nWhile Mr. Lippe was thanking<br />\nGod for being born free and white<br />\nin America, would it have been<br />\ninappropriate to include a prayer<br />\nfor those less fortunate than<br />\nhimself?

My proposal, using estimates from LPB<br />\nIncorporated of Pennsylvaia, asked for about $700 per building to<br />\nbe wired for the signal. I would<br />\nlike to wire ten buildings. I would<br />\nalso like to join IBS (Intercollegiate Broadcasting Service)<br />\nfor about $200 a year. IBS provides records, features, legal<br />\nhelp, and they throw great conventions.

It went to #1 in England,<br />\nand that guitar riff sounds electrifying on the radio. \"Spirit\" is<br />\ndefinitely the highlight of<br />\nLaughing at the Pieces, but<br />\nthere's still quite a bit of silly fun<br />\nto be had here. How seriously can<br />\nyou take a band that writes songs<br />\nwith titles like \"Smallness of the<br />\nMustard Pot,\" \"Watermelon<br />\nRunaway\" and \"No-one Loves<br />\nYou When You've Got No<br />\nShoes\"?<br />\nThe Doctor, ne Clive Jackson,<br />\nhas an expansive hairdo and a<br />\nvoice somewhere between<br />\nDevo's Mark Mothersbaugh and<br />\nPete Burns of Dead or Alive.<br />\nBackground Wendi and Collette<br />\ntrade vox with the Doc in the<br />\nmidst of Steve Maguire's glitterpop guitar. It's a slick sound,<br />\nalmost too smooth at times; songs<br />\nlike \"Watermelon Runaway\"<br />\nseem to cry out for rougher<br />\ntreatments, and that's what<br />\nultimately keeps the Medics from<br />\nreaching the ultimate 60's<br />\ntrashrock groove they seem to<br />\nseek.<br />\nNevertheless, Laughing at the<br />\nPieces bops along appealingly.<br />\n\"Kettle on a Long Chain\" is punchy and energetic rock, \"Moon<br />\nSong\" is alternately whimsical<br />\nand ethereal, and \"Miracle of the<br />\nAge,\" produced by XTC's Andy Partridge, is engagingly<br />\nquirky. I probably won't want<br />\nanything to do with this album in<br />\na few months, but for now, Doctor and the Medics are a nifty<br />\nnovelty.<br />\n<br />\nIRS Records<br />\n<br />\n\"We buy our hairspray wholesale!\"<br />\n<br />\nHot Bands From Manchester, Part One<br />\nby Sue Trowbridge<br />\n<br />\nThe Chameleons U.K.<br />\nStrange Times<br />\n<br />\n\"Oh, Manchester, so much to Geffen Records<br />\nanswer for,\" sang Morrissey of<br />\nthe Smiths in a track called<br />\n\"Suffer Little Children.\" The<br />\nThis is the Chameleons' third<br />\nlyrics of the song referred to the record, and their first truly<br />\nBritish city's once-notorious wonderful one.

Anybody who<br />\ndares to record a song called<br />\n\"Get Back To Russia\" is<br />\nguaranteed to raise eyebrows<br />\non both sides of the Atlantic,<br />\nbut Contenders, Easterhouse's<br />\ndebut, received plenty of acclaim when it was released last<br />\nsummer in England.<br />\nMany of Easterhouse's songs<br />\ncriticize Britain's liberal Labour<br />\nParty. \"A Labour Party man<br />\ncomes *knocking on my<br />\ndoor/Around election time<br />\nonce more/He's counting on<br />\nmy loyal support/What did his<br />\nparty ever do for me?\" sings<br />\nAndy Perry bitterly in \"Out On<br />\nYour Own.\" \"Nineteen Sixty<br />\nNine\" calls the Labour loyalists<br />\nof<br />\nform<br />\nlowest<br />\n\"the<br />\nhypocrite.\"<br />\n<br />\nEasterhouse seem more interested in the songs' lyrical<br />\ncontent than in the music, and<br />\nthey do voice their concerns<br />\neloquently. The music isn't<br />\nalways as rousing, though there<br />\nare a few songs that should<br />\nplease even those who neither<br />\nknow nor care who Neil Kinflock is.<br />\nMost of their music sports a<br />\nmajestic sound which is not<br />\nmiles away from that of U2 or<br />\nGene Loves .Jezebel. \"Cargo of<br />\nSouls\" features some fierce<br />\ndrumming by Gary Rostock<br />\nand yearning harmonica by<br />\nPerry, and \"Nineteen Sixty<br />\nNine\" is a stirring song about<br />\nBritain's shameful oppression<br />\nof Ireland.<br />\nBut since Easterhouse take<br />\ntheir politics so seriously, they<br />\ncan't help but seem a bit dour<br />\nat times (\"Do we curse the<br />\nchild/To this foolish world of<br />\nours?. . . were we not born to be<br />\nfree?\").

Knopf, Inc.<br />\n$17.95, 329 pages.<br />\nApproach John Updike's latest<br />\nnovel, Roger's Version, \\kith a<br />\nslide rule and a Latin dictionary.<br />\nBoth are necessary as Updike<br />\nproves that more research is not<br />\nnecessarily better. This is not to<br />\nimply that his story is in any way<br />\nlacking, or that the points which<br />\nhe makes about faith and middle<br />\nage are insubstantial. There is a<br />\nvery solid novel hiding under the<br />\ntechnological and theological<br />\ntrappings.<br />\nThe Roger of the title is a professor of theology at a prestigious<br />\nNew England liberal arts college<br />\n(read Harvard). He has had a difficult past, changing marriages<br />\nand leaving the active ministry,<br />\nbut now has easily settled into<br />\nacademic life. He has the requisite book-lined office and<br />\ntweed jacket, as well as the usual<br />\nlarge house and bored wife. He<br />\ndrives an Audi and smokes a<br />\npipe. The image is familiar and<br />\ncomfortable.<br />\nAn unsettling force is introduced when Dale Kohler, a graduate<br />\nstudent in computer science,<br />\ncomes to Roger about a grant for<br />\na project. Dale intends to prove<br />\nby mathematical manipulation<br />\n<br />\nthat God exists. Roger is nonplussed and becomes more so as<br />\nDale goes on at length about the<br />\nmathematical improbability of the<br />\nUniverse,<br />\ni.e. \". . . the<br />\nbackground microwave radiation<br />\nof 3 K discovered in 1964 has<br />\nbeen observed to be constant to<br />\none part in ten thousand . . .\"or<br />\n\". . . take a neutron: if it were only point nine nine eight of its actual value, free protons would<br />\ndecay into neutrons via positron<br />\nemission and there would be no<br />\natoms at all!\" This is all very interesting, but not half so as the<br />\nstudent's parting shot that an errant niece of the professor's has<br />\nmoved into the area. This sets<br />\nRoger off on a mission to help the<br />\ngirl find a job and a safer place<br />\nto live\u2014he finds her in a public<br />\nhousing project. In the meantime,<br />\nhe becomes attracted to her and<br />\ncarries on (largely in his own<br />\nmind) and affair with her. This<br />\nnicely counterbalancees his suspicion that his wife has taken up<br />\nwith Dale, whom he initially<br />\nhired as a math tutor for his son.<br />\nAbove the more carnal action,<br />\nRoger and Dale carry on a<br />\nnumber of conversations about<br />\nthe nature of God and the lack of<br />\nproof inherent in faith. At the<br />\nbook's beginning, Dale's faith is<br />\nunshakeable, fundamental. The<br />\ncourse of the book charts the<br />\ndecline of his basic faith while at<br />\n<br />\nthe same time pointing up the<br />\ndurability of Roger's more worldworn beliefs.<br />\nThese elements are liberally interspersed with lengthy passages<br />\nabout particle physics and the<br />\ntheology of Tertullian. While<br />\nthese sections certainly add versimilitude, they do little for the<br />\nreader who is unfamiliar with<br />\nHeisenberg or De Carnis.

The actual intelligence that it measures,<br />\nhowever, has been quoted again<br />\nand again in scholarly journals<br />\nand texts as being composed of a<br />\ngenetic (and therefore racial)<br />\ncomponent as well as an environmental component. \"To<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 deny that environment (social and would most possibly be the<br />\neconomic conditions of the upbr- same,\" the local psychologist has<br />\ninging of a child) is relevant in said.<br />\nmeasurable intelligence of a perIn the Department of<br />\nson is foolhardy,\" said a local Sociology, the report is generaluniversity psychology professor. ly frowned upon by the colEven more revealing is that, leagues of Gordon and Gottfredalthough it is very hard to quan- son. \"I have a difficult time<br />\ntize what part of intelligence is discussing this report with my<br />\ndetermined by genetics and what colleagues,\" stated Gordon.<br />\npart by environment, many \"(My colleagues) like to blame<br />\nreferences such as the En- racial inequality on acceptable<br />\ncyclopaedia Britannica (1975, targets like racism and the<br />\nVol.8, p.1148) state \"most in- economic system without any<br />\nvestigations have yielded evidence,\" continued Gordon. \"I<br />\nheritability estimates between travel in academic, which means<br />\n70-80 percent. . .unlikely that the liberal, circles, and it is ungenotype contributes less than 50 fashionable to speak of anything<br />\npercent.\" Other quotes include, that speaks of cultural bias.\"<br />\nOn the other hand, the reports<br />\n\"The heritability of IQ test scores<br />\n(=intelligence) is in the of both researchers were<br />\nneighborhood of 80 percent.\" presented to the American<br />\n(LI.

We<br />\nsimply do not have that kind of<br />\nmoney available.\" Further, the<br />\nadministration fears the AM station \"would be too similar to<br />\nwhat already exists on the FM<br />\ndial.\" Consequently, what Welch<br />\ndescribed as the \"uniqueness factor\" is of key importance.<br />\nIt is possible, however, that the<br /><br />\nstart-up cost might be \"far less<br />\nthan had been suggested in the<br />\npast,\" said Welch. The alternative: engaging Hopkins engineering students to build the<br />\nnecessary receptor devices. There<br />\nis \"something about that which is<br />\nappealing,\" observed Welch.<br />\nThe minimum number of receptors is three.<br />\nA survey done last year asking<br />\nhow many students listened to<br />\nWJHU, in Welch's words, \"got<br />\na very paltry response.\"<br />\nTherefore, it appears as though<br />\nthe installation of the station could<br />\nbe dependent on certain caveats<br />\nwhich would ensure that the<br />\n\"programming is unique,\" and<br />\nthat the student residences had<br />\n\"the appropriate receiving<br />\ncapabilities,\" and low cost.<br /><br />\n411.-41W-AW:AW_4W24W74W -1_ 41W_4W_AW_ .<br />\n41<br /><br />\nPI LAMBDA PHI FRATERNITY<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nPi Lambda Phi Fraternity<br />\nProudly Presents<br />\nThe First Annual Pi Lam Open<br />\nFrisbee Golf Championship<br />\nSaturday and Sunday<br />\nNovember 8-9, 1986<br />\nHomewood Campus<br />\nEntry Fee: $3<br />\nFrisbee rentals<br />\navailable<br />\nfree refreshments<br /><br />\n0<br />\nA<br /><br />\nFirst tee time: 8 a.m.<br />\nTrophies and prizes<br />\nwill be awarded<br /><br />\nFor information call John at 243-2036<br />\nCo-sponsored by the Office of the<br />\nChaplain, JHU<br /><br />\n.411W=<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nFisher said that the plans for<br />\nresignation were announced<br />\nyesterday \"to clear the deck for<br />\nthe search for successors. . .<br />\nPlans for the search are still very<br />\nmuch in the works.\" But he added that when a search for successors does get underway, it will<br />\nlikely be directed by Muller with<br />\nthe assistance of a new provost<br />\n(who has not yet been picked to<br />\nsucceed Richard Longaker, the<br />\nrecently retired provost and VicePresident for Academic Affairs).<br />\nCommenting on the role he will<br />\nplay in the search for his successor, Fisher said, \"I'm sure I<br />\nwill provide several suggestions<br />\nif I am asked, but I don't expect<br />\nto play a central role.\"<br />\nFisher said, \"My decision to<br />\nreturn to research and teaching<br />\nwas made over the summer after<br />\nturning fifty.

Going to press five times<br />\nper year, the journal has the purpose to represent the major<br />\nmodern languages; and, according to Macksey, the journal<br />\n\"was but one enduring manifestation of President Gilman's program to translate the European<br />\nhigher learning to this country<br />\nand its own historical aspirations.\"<br />\nAs concerns the delegations,<br />\nMacksey declared, \"I hope there<br />\nwill be some discussion across<br />\ndisciplinary lines.\" Similar conferences have been known to have<br />\nshown a lack of \"transdisciplinary dialogue,\" a difficulty the<br />\nprofessor intends to avoid. To<br />\nmete out this end, both Macksey<br />\nand the former general editor of<br />\nMLN,Paul R. Olson have arranged as comfortable a stay as is<br /><br />\npossible for the visitors.<br />\nHopkins can expect many lectures on subjects such as \"Critical<br />\nSelf-Consciousness or: Dennis<br />\nMartiniz and the Uses of<br />\nTheory\" from Professor Stanley<br />\nFish of Duke University, and<br />\n\"Criticism as Institutions: 100<br />\nGerman Studies in MLN\" from<br />\nHopkins' native son Dr. William<br />\nMcClain of the German Department.<br />\nThe public, particularly<br />\nHopkins students, are invited to<br />\nbenefit from this assembly as the<br />\nmajority of lectures will be held<br />\nin Mudd Hall.<br />\nBesides the very weighty<br />\nundertones in the nature of the<br />\nsymposium, it is refreshing to<br />\nnote Macksey's first aspiration<br />\nfor the affair: \"I hope it'll be a<br />\nnice birthday party.\"<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/7<br /><br />\nFINALLYA<br />\nFREE FLIGHT PLAN<br />\nJUST FOR STUDENTS.<br />\nYOU WON'TGEM<br />\n\u2022 BREAK LIKE'THIS<br />\nONCE YOU'RE OUT IN<br />\nTHE REALWORLD.<br />\nINTRODUCING COLLEGIATE FUGHTBANK,FROM Or the grand prize,for the number one student referral<br />\nchampion in the nation: a Porsche and one year of unlimited<br />\nCONTINENTAL AND NEW YORK AIR.<br />\nIf you're a full-time student at an accredited college or university you can join our Collegiate FlightBankr You'll receive<br />\na membership cad and number that will allow you to get<br />\n10% off Continental and New York Air's already low fares.

In an unexpected move, George Fisher, dean of the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences and Matthew<br />\nCrenson, associate dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences, suddenly announced their plans<br />\nto resign from the administration at the end<br />\nof this academic year.<br />\nThe two deans apparently made their<br />\ndecision to resign in order to return to<br />\nteaching and research, in good Hopkins<br />\nform.<br />\nThe resignation of any dean is certainly<br />\ngrounds for some interest and concern. But<br />\nthe simultaneous resignation fo Fisher and<br />\nCrenson is, without a doubt, one of the<br />\nmost important administrative changes to<br />\noccur at Homewood in recent years.<br />\nAs the top men in the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences (the largest academic division at<br />\nHomewood), Fisher and Crenson have<br />\ndone an excellent job in directing and coordinating a vast array of academic departments. Furthermore, both deans have been<br />\nremarkably accessible and eager to work<br />\nwith students.<br />\nIt's difficult to single out any specific<br />\nachievement exclusively attributable to the<br />\nwork of the departing deans. However, that<br />\nprobably is as it should be. After all, the<br />\nmark of many good and efficient administrators is the lack of a distinctive<br /><br />\nmark.<br />\nAs the shock of the resignations abates,<br />\nthoughts must turn to the future of the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences. Soon a search<br />\nwill be underway to find a successor to<br />\nFisher. The administration should keep two<br />\nthings in mind as it begins looking for a new<br />\ndean.<br />\nFirst, students ought to be given a voice<br />\nin the selection process. No dean has a<br />\nmore profound and lasting effect on the<br />\nacademic prestige of the University than the<br />\ndean of the School of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nHis decisions directly affect students and<br />\nwhat they study. It seems appropriate,<br />\ntherefore, that students should be given<br />\nsome input in the selection of such a new<br />\ndean.<br />\nSecond, the selection process ought to be<br />\ntargetted to an individual who will be willing to devote many years to the Homewood<br />\nadministration. Developing the necessary<br />\ncontacts and inside working knowledge of<br />\nan institution as complicated as Hopkins<br />\ntakes years. It's a long-term<br />\ncommitment\u2014not the kind of job that<br />\nshould be tracked for a rapid turn-over.<br />\nFisher and Crenson will certainly and<br />\nrightfully be missed in the Homewood administration next year. We only hope that<br />\na prudent selection process will result in the<br />\nhiring of equally competent successors.<br /><br />\nAt the Bottom of the Pack<br />\nTwo weeks ago, an Ad Hoc Faculty<br />\nPlanning Committee issued a long-awaited<br />\nreport on the status of the M.S.E. Library.<br />\nThe report, which was eighteen months in<br />\nthe making, concluded that the library<br />\n\"faces serious problems within its collections, a shortage of personnel\u2014particularly<br />\nbibliographers\u2014and pressing short-term<br />\nand long-term space requirements.\" Even<br />\nan eighteen minute walk through M.S.E.<br />\ndramatically confirms those conclusions.<br />\nFor the very few among us who haven't<br />\nhad the occasion to visit the library recently, two observations are striking. First, the<br />\nstacks are jammed full. There is often so<br />\nlittle room on a shelf that stackers resort<br />\nto cramming books into little crevices on<br />\ntop of other books. Second, the books that<br />\nare available (with the exception of scientific texts) are often hopelessly out of date.<br />\nYou may be able to find an eighteenth century printing of Moliere, but good luck<br />\nsearching for something as 'exotic' as<br />\nVonnegut.<br />\nThese two observations point to two of<br />\nthe most serious problems addressed in the<br />\nFaculty Planning Committee's report\u2014<br />\nnamely the shortage of space and the<br />\nmiserable acquisition track-record of<br />\nM.S.E.<br />\nCurrently, the library is full and has<br />\nessentially been so since the mid 1970's.<br />\nOverflow, until now, has been managed by<br />\nmoving books into the Gilman stacks for<br />\nstorage. But within two or three years, even<br />\nthat overflow space will be exhaused and<br />\npossibly reduced in size due to upcoming<br />\nrenovations to Gilman. Eventually, plans<br />\ncall for converting Rowland Hall into additional stack space. But even liberal<br />\nestimates suggest that such a change<br />\ncouldn't be finished at least until the early<br />\nor mid 1990's.<br /><br />\nThese space limitations put the library in<br />\na difficult position to be sure. But what is<br />\nastonishing is the failure of the University<br />\nhistorically to do anything to correct the<br />\nproblem.<br />\nNew books are, of course, the second<br />\nmajor problem addressed by the Faculty<br />\nPlanning Committee's report. According to<br />\nthe report, among fourteen comparable<br />\nlibraries which belong to the Association<br />\nof Research Libraries, Hopkins ranks thirteenth in the acquisition rate of new books.<br />\nAmong the 106 member ARL libraries,<br />\nHopkins ranks 101. Any way you slice it,<br />\nthe M.S.E. Library comes out at the very<br />\nbottom of the pack.<br />\nUndoubtedly, part of the reason for<br />\nHopkins' shortcomings in acquisitions is the<br />\nfact that there will soon be nowhere to put<br />\nadditional titles. Nevertheless, Hopkins'<br />\nmiserable acquisition rate cannot be simply glossed over. Already, some departments<br />\nhave indicated that their programs are suffering from a lack of literary resources. If<br />\nthose claims are true, and they probably<br />\nare, the University should be outraged.<br />\nNo top-rated prestigious research institution can function without a top-rated<br />\nprestigious library. If Hopkins is indeed<br />\ndedicated to the acquisition and disemination of knowledge, it needs to make a much<br />\nstronger commitment to the improvement<br />\nof the M.S.E. Library. Specifically, more<br />\nspace needs to be built, more books need<br />\nto be bought, and more bibliographers need<br />\nto be hired.<br />\nNone of these suggestions is easy and all<br />\nare expensive. But if Hopkins intends to retain its reputation of academic excellence,<br />\nit needs to devote inordinate resources and<br />\nattention to the M.S.E. Library during the<br />\nnext few years.<br /><br />\nbrutally<br />\nfrank<br />\nLoyal legions of readers<br />\nnumber 12 million.

At present,<br />\nwe are unsure as to the extent to<br />\nwhich Gergyes has mixed his opinions with the findings of Drs.<br />\nGordon and Gottfredson.<br />\nThe B.S.U. was appalled with<br />\nthe severe racial undertones that<br />\nthis article carried. However, this<br />\nis not the major bone of contention. Rather we are responsible<br />\nconcerned with the ramification<br />\nan article of this nature can have<br />\nin our community. Furthermore,<br />\nthe black students vehemently reject the implications that we did<br />\nnot earn our right to study at this<br />\nor any other institution, but rather<br />\nwe have been granted admission<br />\nonly as a matter of pity or as a<br />\ndirect result of affirmative action.<br />\nThe picture painted by the article<br />\nis blatantly twisted and this matter will be rectified through our<br />\nown means.<br />\nJ. Chauncey Morris, Jr.<br />\nExecutive Chairman, BSU<br /><br />\nVictims of Environment<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe article by Joseph Gergyes,<br />\n\"JHU Profs Attribute Poorer Job<br />\nPerformance and Criminality of<br />\nBlacks to Lower I.Q.,\" has provoked me to jump into the controversy.<br />\nIn an article published in Journal of Applied Nutrition<br />\n(Volume 36, Number 2, 1984;<br />\npp. 81-102), Dr. Robert Thatcher<br />\nof the Applied Neuroscience<br />\nResearch Institute, University of<br />\nMaryland and Dr. Diane Fishbein<br />\nof The Department of Criminal<br />\nJustice of The University of<br />\nBaltimore applied quantitative<br />\nelectrophysiology to study some<br />\nof the same issues addressed by<br />\nDr. Robert Gordon and Dr. Linda Gottfredson. Among the correlations observed by Thatcher<br />\nand Fishbein was that between<br />\nmean lead burden (as measured in<br />\nhair) and low I.Q.. That is, the<br />\nlowest achievers had the highest<br />\nlead burden.<br />\nPerhaps those individuals who<br />\nlived in housing contaminated<br />\nwith lead paint, who were<br />\nmalnourished, and who lived in<br />\nhigh traffic zones with much lead<br /><br />\npollution are the most at risk for<br />\npoor job performance and crimininality.. If blacks fit into this<br />\ncategory they are the victims of<br />\nour environment and society. One<br />\ncannot infer from the work of<br />\nGordon and Gottfredson any<br />\ndeeper significance about blacks<br />\nas a group. The danger of uncritical interpretation of the work<br />\nof Gordon and Gottfredson is that<br />\nit can so easily be twisted to<br />\nsatisfy a bigoted and racist point<br />\nof view.<br />\nRuth Aranow<br />\nThe writer is a member of the<br />\nChemistry Department<br /><br />\nClarifying IQ's<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nJoseph Gergyes is to be commended for presenting a factual<br />\nand unsensationalized account of<br />\nresearch by Dr. Linda Gottfredson and me on the non-educational consequences of group differences in IQ. The black-white<br />\ndifference is merely one example<br />\nof many such group differences.<br />\nIt happens to be of special interest<br />\nbecause it is one of the larger<br />\ngroup differences, and hence has<br />\nbeen subjected to more research<br />\nover a longer time in the U.S.<br />\nStudents have a special need to<br />\ninform themselves about research<br />\nin this area for two reasons. First,<br />\njudging from its stability over the<br />\npast 60 years, the black-white difference is likely to be with us for<br />\nsome time to come. Second, the<br />\nconsequences of the difference<br />\nare neither limited to school contexts nor trivial. Hence, students<br />\nof both races will furnish the<br />\nleaders of tomorrow who must<br />\ngrapple with problems of our<br />\nmulti-racial society.<br />\nUnfortunately, too much of the<br />\nteaching at our best universities<br />\nmisattributes racial problems in<br />\nways that serve only to undermine appreciation for the tremendous strides made by Americans<br />\nover the past two decades toward<br />\nremoving artificial racial barriers.<br />\nThose barriers to equality that<br />\nstill remain seem to be of a different sort altogether, and we are<br />\nnot equipped either ideologically<br />\nor scientifically for confronting<br />\nthem honestly.

Faidley<br /><br />\nStomaching Free Speech<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOn Tuesday, October 14th, I<br />\nwas in attendance at the third of<br />\nfour informal dialogues between<br />\nTrustees and students on the subject of divestment. It was soon apparent that I was the only nonCoalition student present. Discussion was nevertheless spirited and<br />\nlively. But then, upon raising my<br />\nhand to be recognized, a Coalition member leaned over my<br />\nshoulder and explained that this<br />\nmeeting was really just for the<br />\nCoalition to speak with the<br />\nTrustees, and that the Coalition,<br />\nwith the cooperation of the<br />\nTrustees. had already decided<br /><br />\nupon who was to speak, and that<br />\nunfortunately I could not be one<br />\nof these. It is obvious that what<br />\nI was told by this Coalition<br />\nmember was not at all the design<br />\nof the Trustees, as I was soon<br />\ncalled upon.<br />\nNonetheless, I would like to<br />\nask the Coalition for whom they<br />\nespouse \"freedom of expression.\" The dialogue I attended<br />\nwas meant to be an open forum.<br />\nIt appears that the Coalition does<br />\nnot have quite the respect for<br />\nfreedom of speech that it claims<br />\nto champion when the speech is<br />\nnot their own. Let me make it<br />\nclear that I regard apartheid with<br />\nthe same degree of disgust as<br />\nmost of the Hopkins community,<br />\nincluding the Coalition. It was<br />\nassumed that because I am not a<br />\nCoalition member, I do not support divestment. The fact is that<br />\nthe Coalition was correct. I do not<br />\nsupport divestment, but I ask: is<br />\nthe mark of a tolerant attitude an<br />\nattempt to prevent opponents<br />\nfrom speaking? Many of us have<br />\nbeen forced to suffer the Coalition's shanty in regard for free<br />\nspeech. Why then, does the<br />\nCoalition, supposedly the<br />\ndefender of \"free speech\" on this<br />\ncampus, find it so difficult to<br />\nstomach free speech in the<br />\nmouths of others?<br /><br />\nreference to Trustees who feel<br />\ndivestment is ineffective in<br />\neliminating apartheid. Another<br />\nposter claimed that the Trustees<br />\nare \"working for apartheid.\"<br />\nThis propaganda has created an<br />\natmosphere where individuals<br />\nfear speaking out against divestment because they too will be<br />\nlabelled racists. I have encountered such reactions<br />\nrepeatedly in my distribution of<br />\na petition supporting continued<br />\ninvestment in companies that are<br />\npromoting the welfare of blacks<br />\nin South Africa. Many students<br />\nexpress support for the petition,<br />\nbut refuse to sign it because they<br />\nfear the stigma of opposing divestment. Some who appear sympathetic to the petition remain<br />\nsilent when unsure of the views<br />\nof others present. Despite this intimidation, I presently have over<br />\n250 signatures and I hope for<br />\nmany more before submitting the<br />\npetition to the Trustees.<br />\nAs a final note, I would like to<br />\npoint out Thomas Jefferson's<br />\ndesire that the Constitution should<br />\nprotect the minority and especially the individual from a \"tyranny of the majority,\" be that majority real or merely perceived.<br /><br />\nTHE<br />\nUNIVERSITY<br />\nOF OXFORD<br />\nSeveral colleges of Oxford University have invited<br />\nHampden-Sydney College to recommend a few highly<br />\nqualified students to study for one or two academic<br />\nterms (or one academic year).<br />\nUpper Sophomore status required.<br />\nTranscripts will be issued to the home college in U.S.<br />\ncredit terms through Hampden-Sydney College,<br />\nfounded in Virginia by James Madison in 1776.<br /><br />\nGraduate Study is an option.<br />\nA special summer program is offered under the<br />\ndirection of Hampden-Sydney College.<br /><br />\nINTERNSHIPS IN LONDON<br />\nand WASHINGTON<br />\nAcademic Internships and Courses are also offered by<br />\nthe Center.<br />\nFOR MORE INFORMATION,PLEASE WRITE TO:<br />\nWashington International Studies Center<br />\nRoom 713A,901 Sixth Street, S.W.<br />\nWashington,DC 20024<br />\nEO/AA<br /><br />\nIf You've Never Heard OfIt,<br />\nAsk Your Folks.<br /><br />\nSteven Basta<br /><br />\nSecuring Sacred Shanties<br />\nPeretz<br /><br />\nHirshbein<br /><br />\nTyranny of the Majority<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn the 1950's, Senator Joseph<br />\nMcCarthy spearheaded a campaign to rid the United States of<br />\nCommunists.

The tone and complete lack of logic expressed are<br />\nequally appalling. Mr. Bernstein<br />\nstates in the Oct. 3 News-Letter<br /><br />\nthat in the past the University has<br />\nalways allowed the Jewish students to build a sukkah on campus and argues that this practice<br />\nis \"threatened\" by \"haphazard\"<br />\nand \"irresponsible statements\"<br />\nmade by the Coalition. To perceive the Coalition's stand against<br />\nthe University's ban on unauthorized structures as a threat is absurd. The real threat is clearly<br />\nposed by the University ban<br />\nitself. Not content to confine his<br />\nargument to campus politics, Mr.<br />\nBernstein explores the realm of<br />\nConstitutional Law yet remains<br />\nunable to comprehend how<br />\nanyone could possible equate<br />\nreligious with political freedoms,<br />\ndespite the fact that both of these<br />\nfreedoms seem to have been<br />\nequally worthy of protection in<br />\nthe eyes of the Founding Fathers.<br />\nFinally one is faced with the<br />\nparanoid indignation of Mr.<br />\nLippe(News-Letter Oct. 10), who<br />\nwas concerned with what might<br />\nhave been. . I find Mr. Lippe's<br />\nself-centered posture particularly<br />\noffensive given the context of the<br />\nRosh Hashanah observance,<br />\nwhich celebrates the Jewish New<br />\nYear as a time of thanksgiving.<br />\nWhile Mr. Lippe was thanking<br />\nGod for being born free and white<br />\nin America, would it have been<br />\ninappropriate to include a prayer<br />\nfor those less fortunate than<br />\nhimself?

Knopf, Inc.<br />\n$17.95, 329 pages.<br />\nApproach John Updike's latest<br />\nnovel, Roger's Version, \\kith a<br />\nslide rule and a Latin dictionary.<br />\nBoth are necessary as Updike<br />\nproves that more research is not<br />\nnecessarily better. This is not to<br />\nimply that his story is in any way<br />\nlacking, or that the points which<br />\nhe makes about faith and middle<br />\nage are insubstantial. There is a<br />\nvery solid novel hiding under the<br />\ntechnological and theological<br />\ntrappings.<br />\nThe Roger of the title is a professor of theology at a prestigious<br />\nNew England liberal arts college<br />\n(read Harvard). He has had a difficult past, changing marriages<br />\nand leaving the active ministry,<br />\nbut now has easily settled into<br />\nacademic life. He has the requisite book-lined office and<br />\ntweed jacket, as well as the usual<br />\nlarge house and bored wife. He<br />\ndrives an Audi and smokes a<br />\npipe. The image is familiar and<br />\ncomfortable.<br />\nAn unsettling force is introduced when Dale Kohler, a graduate<br />\nstudent in computer science,<br />\ncomes to Roger about a grant for<br />\na project. Dale intends to prove<br />\nby mathematical manipulation<br /><br />\nthat God exists. Roger is nonplussed and becomes more so as<br />\nDale goes on at length about the<br />\nmathematical improbability of the<br />\nUniverse,<br />\ni.e. \". . . the<br />\nbackground microwave radiation<br />\nof 3 K discovered in 1964 has<br />\nbeen observed to be constant to<br />\none part in ten thousand . . .\"or<br />\n\". . . take a neutron: if it were only point nine nine eight of its actual value, free protons would<br />\ndecay into neutrons via positron<br />\nemission and there would be no<br />\natoms at all!\" This is all very interesting, but not half so as the<br />\nstudent's parting shot that an errant niece of the professor's has<br />\nmoved into the area. This sets<br />\nRoger off on a mission to help the<br />\ngirl find a job and a safer place<br />\nto live\u2014he finds her in a public<br />\nhousing project. In the meantime,<br />\nhe becomes attracted to her and<br />\ncarries on (largely in his own<br />\nmind) and affair with her. This<br />\nnicely counterbalancees his suspicion that his wife has taken up<br />\nwith Dale, whom he initially<br />\nhired as a math tutor for his son.<br />\nAbove the more carnal action,<br />\nRoger and Dale carry on a<br />\nnumber of conversations about<br />\nthe nature of God and the lack of<br />\nproof inherent in faith. At the<br />\nbook's beginning, Dale's faith is<br />\nunshakeable, fundamental. The<br />\ncourse of the book charts the<br />\ndecline of his basic faith while at<br /><br />\nthe same time pointing up the<br />\ndurability of Roger's more worldworn beliefs.<br />\nThese elements are liberally interspersed with lengthy passages<br />\nabout particle physics and the<br />\ntheology of Tertullian. While<br />\nthese sections certainly add versimilitude, they do little for the<br />\nreader who is unfamiliar with<br />\nHeisenberg or De Carnis. As for<br />\nsuggesting the intrusion of<br />\ntechnology into faith, these<br />\npassages may be useful but are<br />\nultimately more distracting.<br />\nThe other obvious weak point<br />\nwhich turns out to be useful is<br />\nRoger's role as narrator. Because<br />\nthe entire novel is seen through<br />\nRoger's eyes, all the action is at<br />\nthe same time distorted and instructive. Roger's true feelings<br />\ntoward the emptiness of his marriage are revealed in his descriptions of his wife's meetings with<br />\nDale. In the same way, his reaction to his niece reinforced earlier<br />\ncomments about the family problems of his youth, which she<br />\npersonified.<br />\nIf faith and technology are to<br />\ncoexist, there must be a boundary<br />\nbetween them. This is the final<br />\nmessage in Dale's quest for God.<br />\nIn wanting to know too much, he<br />\nends up believing nothing. Roger<br />\nfinds that there is serenity in his<br />\nless technological faith, and in the<br />\nend, both have grown.<br /><br />\nRogeri<br />\nVersion<br />\n\\\\ \\I<br />\nJohn<br />\nUpdike<br />\nh<br /><br />\nThe 'Superficial' Last Generation<br />\nby Claudia Link<br />\nLess Than Zero<br />\nby Bret Easton Ellis,<br />\nSimon and Schuster<br />\n$15.95, 208 pages.<br />\nYou're sitting in your room.<br />\nYou're not quite sure what you're<br />\ndoing there, you think you're<br />\nwatching MTV.

The actual intelligence that it measures,<br />\nhowever, has been quoted again<br />\nand again in scholarly journals<br />\nand texts as being composed of a<br />\ngenetic (and therefore racial)<br />\ncomponent as well as an environmental component. \"To<br /><br />\n\u2022 deny that environment (social and would most possibly be the<br />\neconomic conditions of the upbr- same,\" the local psychologist has<br />\ninging of a child) is relevant in said.<br />\nmeasurable intelligence of a perIn the Department of<br />\nson is foolhardy,\" said a local Sociology, the report is generaluniversity psychology professor. ly frowned upon by the colEven more revealing is that, leagues of Gordon and Gottfredalthough it is very hard to quan- son. \"I have a difficult time<br />\ntize what part of intelligence is discussing this report with my<br />\ndetermined by genetics and what colleagues,\" stated Gordon.<br />\npart by environment, many \"(My colleagues) like to blame<br />\nreferences such as the En- racial inequality on acceptable<br />\ncyclopaedia Britannica (1975, targets like racism and the<br />\nVol.8, p.1148) state \"most in- economic system without any<br />\nvestigations have yielded evidence,\" continued Gordon. \"I<br />\nheritability estimates between travel in academic, which means<br />\n70-80 percent. . .unlikely that the liberal, circles, and it is ungenotype contributes less than 50 fashionable to speak of anything<br />\npercent.\" Other quotes include, that speaks of cultural bias.\"<br />\nOn the other hand, the reports<br />\n\"The heritability of IQ test scores<br />\n(=intelligence) is in the of both researchers were<br />\nneighborhood of 80 percent.\" presented to the American<br />\n(LI.
