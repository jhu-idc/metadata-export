Such spirit is surely an answer<br />\nto the mistaken theory that spirit is wanting at Hopkins. The class<br />\nteams of last year were recognized as one of the reasons for the successful lacrosse year. They not only aroused interest but developed<br />\nmaterial. Without interest and a well-trained scrub a team is seriously<br />\nhandicapped. Let us hope that 1902's enthusiasm will be well repaid in the shape of another<br />\nchampionship team in 1907!<br />\n<br />\nHE gentle reader will notice in this issue two letters. One is the official<br />\nstatement of the Board of Governors of the Athletic Association in regard to baseball and undergraduate football; the other a letter from Mr.<br />\nThomas Campbell apropos of baseball. Mr. Campbell's letter is equally<br />\nauthorative. THE NEWS-LETTER believes there should be a baseball<br />\nteam if it is possible. Also it believes there should be no criticism of<br />\nthe J. H. U. A. A., in its attitude on baseball up to this time, it should<br />\nbe recognized that no team can be run without money. But it seems to<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER that money is the only consideration. It is to be<br />\nhoped that the undergraduate team idea will not be overworked. It has many advantages but<br />\nthe fact must ever be remembered that the graduate and medical departments have just as good<br />\na right on the teams (other things being equal) as the undergraduates. As a member of the<br />\nAthletic Board has said, \"the undergraduate idea can easily he run into the ground.\"<br />\nThere is no cause for excited words over the baseball situation; if there is need<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nof money for baseball let steps be taken at once, by every one, to raise funds. The writer was<br />\nmuch impressed by the fact that other colleges have taken a very great interest in Hopkins<br />\nsince the defeat of Lehigh and Virginia. THE NEWS-LETTER hopes that baseball will not be<br />\ndropped for there is plenty of material worthy of the financial backing of the students.<br />\n\"Money for Baseball !\"<br />\n<br />\nS we have said before in a previous issue, it is not exactly our intention<br />\nto pull up this or that skeleton which may lurk around the University,<br />\nor to continually point the finger of shame at the various activities which<br />\ngo to make up the daily life of the institution, but rather do we intend<br />\nto furnish a fair statement of the consensus of opinion of the under'graduate body and at the same time to bring out a really interesting<br />\npaper which will count for much in the raising of much lowered moral<br />\nstandards. \"But, 'now to business;' said Sue.\"<br />\nThe recent controversy which has arisen among the students as to<br />\nthe recognition of the baseball team has brought to our mind a question concerning the Athletic Board, that is, what does the Athletic Board really represent? One<br />\nhears on all sides statements as to the partiality of the board as to the unfairness and so on<br />\nuntil one wonders how the board ever were elected.<br />\n<br />\nWhen we acknowledge their election the<br />\n<br />\nquestion arises as to what consensus of opinion do they follow. Among the list of members<br />\nwe see that there are senior delegates, junior delegates and a freshman delegate but as far as<br />\ncan be seen the only thing necessary for their election is that they belong to their respective<br />\nclasses. Do they then necessarily represent the members of their class. According to the<br />\npresent system of election we do not think so. The delegates are elected by the members of<br />\nthe University in toto and it matters little if the class which the delegate is going to represent<br />\nis for or against the one elected. Consequently the delegates of the various classes do not in<br />\nany way represent the opinions of their classes and are in no way bound to carry out any of<br />\nthe plans which that class may see fit to suggest. To my mind this mode of procedure is not<br />\nexactly just to say the least.<br />\nA better plan might be to have the various classes elect their own delegates separately<br />\nand have it understood that these delegates are to follow the expression of opinion of that<br />\nclass. How far it would be beneficial to carry this out is a question which we will not undertake to state here.<br />\nIt is obviously necessary that something must be done in this direction on account of<br />\nthe hammering that the Athletic Board has been receiving in the last two years. Last year<br />\non account of the track team and this year on account of this baseball question. While we<br />\nknow that there will always be complainers, would it not be better to do something to hush<br />\nthis continual knocking than to let things run on as they are? It would be better in our<br />\nopinion to have these delegates elected at the same time as the other officers of the class.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., December 13, 1906.<br />\nMR. CARL BERNHARDT,<br />\nEditor-in-Chief of the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nDEAR SIR :<br />\nNow that the football team has completed its schedule, and the Lacrosse candidates<br />\nought to be beginning to take up their sticks again so as to get into practice for the coming<br />\nseason, we, the undersigned, take this opportunity to come to the front and congratulate the<br />\npersonnel and candidates of the team of 1906 on bringing back the Championship Lacrosse<br />\nBanner to its proper place\u2014in our Trophy Room. Those of us who saw the final contest<br />\nwith Swarthmore were impressed with the good-fellowship and spirit which prevailed in the<br />\nranks of our team; and also by the article of play which was delivered. All we can say is<br />\n\"Good work\" for 1906.<br />\nAt this time we take the liberty to sound a note of warning: \"Do not get chesty;\"<br />\nSwarthmore's team of last Spring will not be able to hold a candle to the same team this next<br />\nSpring. A word to the wise is sufficient.<br />\nHaving indulged in a little preliminary discourse, we will now turn to the real object<br />\nof this letter. The Lacrosse Team of 1902 being satisfied both that its attempt to encourage<br />\nthe beginners met with success last Spring; and that many of the new men, who may have<br />\nfallen by the way-side, were kept at practice, it is again willing to donate twelve silver ioving<br />\ncups to the student body of the Johns Hopkins University. These to be presented to the<br />\nplayers of the team carrying off the palm of victory in two out of a series of three lacrosse<br />\ngames to be played between the Junior and Freshman classes.<br />\nThe condition to govern the contest to be as follows:<br />\nFIRST\u2014The parties to the contest shall be twelve players picked from the Junior Class<br />\non the one side; and twelve players picked from the Freshman and Sub-Freshman classes on<br />\nthe other.<br />\nSECOND\u2014The games may be played on any field the contesting classes may select.<br />\nTHIRD\u2014The games are to be played if possible in March and up to the middle of April<br />\nand on such dates as not to interfere with the practice of the University Lacrosse Team.<br />\nFOURTH\u2014Two out of three games must be played.<br />\nFIFTH\u2014Should any disputes arise between the two classes as to the eligbility o3 any<br />\nstudent, date and place of games, length of halves, officials, etc., it shall devolve upon a<br />\ncommittee consisting of the captain of the 'Varsity Lacrosse Team, the Physical Director of<br />\nthe University and the President of the Board of Governors of the Athletic Association to pass<br />\non such disputes. Whatever decission may be reached by this Committee shall be final.<br />\nSIXTH\u2014If it should so happen that two or more men should be called on to fill the<br />\nin the same or different games throughout the series, it shall devolve on the<br />\nposition,<br />\nsame<br />\nto select the player entitled to receive the prize.<br />\norganization<br />\nclass<br />\nWe suggest that the two classes appoint their respective captains at their earliest opportunity, so that these men may see to it that their candidates report to practice with the<br />\n'Varsity squad and thus raise the standard of the class teams.<br />\nBefore leaving this matter with you we wish to call the attention of the students, who<br />\nare interested in our future lacrosse teams to the fact that the City College Lacrosse Team of<br />\nlast year had a hard struggle to maintain its existence; owing largely to the fact that many of<br />\ntheir men graduated from that institution to swell our number at the Unfversity. Some of the<br />\nundersigned have spent sleepless nights and also class hours in trying to work out plans to<br />\nmake lacrosse a fixture at the City College. Shall we give up this valuable training school for<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nour teams of the future? We ask that you do all in your power to foster this year's team at<br />\nthe College; 'we need its members in our business.\"<br />\nTrusting that you will give this matter your attention in the columns of the NEwsLETTER, and hoping to hear from you that the undergraduates are ready to play a series of<br />\ngames under the conditions as suggested above, we remain,<br />\nYours respectfully,<br />\nTHE LACROSSE TEAM OF 1902.<br />\nB.

By some<br />\nchance the instructor of this course was<br />\nnamed Blinkensop, Ph. D. His real name<br />\nwas Holy Blinky. By chance, in the guise of<br />\na hurried and worried advisor, my friend<br />\nWarren Caruthers Carteret took this course.<br />\nPerhaps it was not chance, but assuredly it<br />\nwas not by design that \"Carrie\" Carderet<br />\nflunked the Christmas examination in History<br />\n7. \"Hence,\" as my friend 'Hooley\" puts<br />\nit, \"the trade winds.\"<br />\nNow it is remarkable how many people<br />\nliked \"Carrie Carteret. Dogs, men and girls<br />\nhad him for their friend and he had them. It<br />\nmay be doubted whether even the instructors<br />\ndid not in the bottom of their hearts, really<br />\nrejoice in his atmosphere. Even little crabbed<br />\nGuerber, the instructor in German 2, was<br />\ncheered when \"Carrie\" politely uncovered to<br />\nhim.<br />\nIt was true that Carruthers did flunk, but<br />\nit as he said was probably because Blinkensop<br />\ndid not approve of tweeds and cigarettes.<br />\n\"And now,\" said Carteret, \"I will thank any<br />\none for a simple paper cigarrette whilst I regale myself (and possibly you) with the tale<br />\nof the 'voyage de M. Blinkensop.'\"<br />\n\"It seems,\" continued Carteret, \"that at<br />\none time my friend Blinky, Ph. D.. was<br />\nselected as the historian of an expedition to<br />\n<br />\nthe West Indies. No. I don't know what<br />\nthe expedition was about, nor why the devil<br />\nhe was selected. But I do want you to understand that Edmund Thensaurochryson<br />\nichochrysides Blinkensop is a most religious,<br />\ncareful, conscientious, scrupulous person, and<br />\nthat is exactly why I didn't get through History 7.<br />\n\"Now on this expedition were, I should<br />\nsay, a very jolly set, even if they were doctors<br />\nof philosophy, and on arriving in port at some<br />\nfoolish island, which belongs to the British<br />\nthey paid their respects to the governor, who<br />\nwas lonesome in his solemnity, which consisted of niggers. And after consuming many<br />\ncooling drinks,(They grow mint on those<br />\nislands, don't they? If they don't I wont<br />\npatronize them.) they, as I was about to say,<br />\nbefore I interrupted myself, were invited to a<br />\nlarge luncheon the following day, which I<br />\nthink was perfectly sweet of the governor. I<br />\nwill thank anyone for another cigarette.<br />\n\"Yes, sir! They were all invited to this<br />\nparty, every man on board, including Holy<br />\nBlinky. Well, naturally, they all put on their<br />\nfine apparel and Blinky primped longer than<br />\nthe rest. So the men on deck, all glorious<br />\nwith white flannel and hat bands, waited for<br />\nBlinky. Finally Blinky appeared in a frock<br />\ncoat, red tie, duck trousers, a yachting cap.<br />\nIt was a great thing, he thought, to be entertained by the representive of the British.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n\"As for the governor, he was looking for a<br />\ntime. His niggers prepared a feast and had<br />\nfrom the cellar the most cobwebby bottles,<br />\n1798 Maderia, and all the rest of it.<br />\n''So Blinky, with the rest of them, entered<br />\ninto the long squatty house, over which waved<br />\nthe British flag. They were taken into the<br />\ndining hall immediately. It is true Blinky<br />\ndid insist on taking his hat and umbrella into<br />\nthe dining room. All these he craftily put<br />\nunder his chair. Nor would he remove the<br />\ncotton gloves. But these are mere details and<br />\nthey were all very polite, of course.<br />\n\"Well, Blinky had never tasted wine, but<br />\nthe heat of the day had aroused an unquenchable thirst. He drank all manner of cooling<br />\ndrinks, which looked harmless and tasted<br />\nawfully good, and then he got red behind the<br />\ngills.<br />\n\"Now just why the conversation turned on<br />\nRoman Government I can't say, because, as I<br />\nsaid before, they were, with Blinky's exception, awfully nice chaps. (Winslow was there\u2014<br />\n'Pinky' Winslow\u2014and he's a corker. He<br />\nwas my brother's roommate at college, and<br />\nthough he is quite a shark at history, he can<br />\ndrink like a fish and tell stories by the yard,<br />\nand his parlor tricks are killing.) But at any<br />\nrate they talked of Roman judicial proceedure.<br />\nThen Blinky pounded on the table with his<br />\nfist and demanded attention. Just to be polite<br />\nthey gave him room. Now if you can understand what a mixture of Bible and Roman<br />\nHistory and cooling drinks are you will be by<br />\nway of knowing what happened.<br />\n\"The Governor being a polite man only<br />\nsaid, 'Only fawncy! Quite true, but what a<br />\nbally ass, don't you know.'<br />\n\"At any rate, just as they grabbed him by<br />\nthe coat tails, Blinky emitted this: 'The<br />\nwhole of Roman judicial proceedure is summed<br />\nup as the Bible excellently and elegantly puts<br />\nit: 'Thou hast appealed unto Cmsar; unto<br />\nCaesar shalt thou go.'

C. C.<br />\n<br />\nBASEBALL.<br />\nDecember 8, 1906.<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter:<br />\nDEAR SIR.\u2014I was delighted to read, in<br />\nyour last issue, an article advocating the recognition of the baseball team for this year. This,<br />\ncoming from a member of last year's team,<br />\nshows that the spiritfor baseball has not entirely succumbed, while at the same time it<br />\nproves that those who took part in the game<br />\nand know most about the matter are eager for<br />\nthe maintenance of the team, and fully aware<br />\nof the fact that it is not only possible to have<br />\none, but that it is the best thing and the only<br />\nthing to do.<br />\nThere are two reasons given for not recognizing the team\u2014namely, lack of interest and<br />\nlack of funds.<br />\nFor anyone to say that there is a lack of interest is as absurd as it would be immaterial<br />\nif it were a fact. If there's no interest\u2014make<br />\nit. Anyone who was present at the Lehigh<br />\ngame last year would have been a poor interpreter of human actions if he should not have<br />\nseen that the fellows were with the team, and<br />\ncrazy for victory and delighted when it came.<br />\nTo tell the truth, I believe there was more interest shown at that game than at any Lacrosse game last year, with the possible exception of;the Swarthmore game, for which I cannot speak as I was not fortunate enough to be<br />\npresent, being at the time at Charlottesville<br />\nwhere we enjoyed another glorious victory.<br />\nBut whatever might have been the real feeling in the matter, the fact remains that there<br />\nwere as many fellows present at the baseball<br />\ngames, and as much rooting, if not more,<br />\nthan at the Lacrosse games.<br />\nSomeone might say: \"Oh, yes, when we<br />\nhave a team, the fellows come out to see the<br />\ngames, but they are not interested enough to<br />\ntry for the team, etc., etc.\" All of which is<br />\nagain absurd, and contrary to fact. We had<br />\nsomething like fifteen or twenty candidates<br />\nlast year. Some of these, it is true, were not<br />\nup to the standard, but the fact remains that<br />\nthey had the spirit to come out. What's more,<br />\nat least half the fellows are back again, and<br />\nthere are other good men who said they would<br />\ncome out this year. All that is needed now,<br />\nis a manager to arrange a schedule and to<br />\ndrum up players, but he's needed immediately.<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThe objection that there are not enough<br />\nfunds to run a baseball team together with the<br />\nother teams, of course is a different matter,<br />\nand can best be decided by the Athletic Board\u2014<br />\nfor they know what money they have and for<br />\nwhat it is to be spent.<br />\nStill, I think if they make a careful study<br />\nof the thing they will come to the conclusion<br />\nthat a baseball team can easily be recognized<br />\nand backed financially. To back up this<br />\nstatement we have only to look at last years<br />\nrecord of expenses, etc.<br />\nThe appropriation for baseball last year was<br />\n$225. Their actual expenses\u2014over gate receipts, etc.\u2014was about $157. This means<br />\nthat the team spent only $157 of the appropriation, i. e. $70 less than was authorized.<br />\nIf this could be done last year, it can be<br />\ndone this year. In fact, I think the team will<br />\nhave fewer expenses this year than last. Last<br />\nyear we had to buy suits which cost about $42;<br />\nwe had to buy a mitt which cost $5. This is<br />\n$47 which will not have to be spent this year.<br />\nBut this is not all\u2014for last year we played St.<br />\nJohn's in Baltimore\u2014or rather scheduled the<br />\ngame there. This year we would have to<br />\nplay at Annapolis, and would receive $30<br />\nguarantee which would more than pay expenses. We could get $40 from Navy, which<br />\nmuch more than pays expenses. West Point<br />\ngave us $125 last year, which paid expenses<br />\nall but about $10. They were very much<br />\npleased with the game, and asked us to be<br />\nsure to come again. I'm certain they would<br />\ngive a guarantee to cover expenses this year.<br />\nUniversity of Virginia gave a guarantee which<br />\npaid expenses all but 8 cents.<br />\nCertainly, from these few facts it is plain<br />\nthat the financial difficulty is more of a myth<br />\nthan a reality. Nor does the fact that the<br />\nthree games played at home failed to pay expenses, alter the matter. It must be remembered that these games were played\u2014two of<br />\nthem on Friday, and the other on Saturday<br />\nmorning. The only other game we had<br />\nscheduled at home was the St. John's game<br />\nwhich more than paid expenses by over $80,<br />\nand which would have paid still more had not<br />\nthe storm come up, and kept the people away.<br />\nI don't want to be \"butting in\" on anything that is none of my business, but as I am<br />\nvery much interested in the team, and as I<br />\n<br />\nknow the facts of the case, I thought it would<br />\nbe worth while acquainting the fellows with<br />\nthe same. While I think the Athletic Board<br />\nhas done what it deems best, I think also that<br />\nthey acted too hastily in abandoning the team,<br />\nand most inexcusably slow in electing another<br />\nmanager. They evidently have an erroneous<br />\nidea of the amount of interest in the game at<br />\nJ. H. U., and they over-estimate the expense<br />\nof running the team.<br />\nWhat would be the result if someone should<br />\nsuggest that we drop Lacrosse? There's not<br />\none of us who would not fight to the last ditch<br />\nto maintain the game. Its our game. In<br />\nLacrosse we're \"it.\" Just so will we fight<br />\nfor baseball. It's the game of America\u2014the<br />\ngame of all colleges. And, while we have<br />\nobtained more glory in Lacrosse, we feel that<br />\nthe baseball team has done, taking everything<br />\ninto consideration, as much.<br />\nLet us not then stand back and say there<br />\nare.too many difficulties to be overcome, but<br />\nlet us get together, have a team, and make it<br />\nsuccessful. The greatest pleasure and glory<br />\nis in doing the hard things. The weakest and<br />\nmeanest thing a man can do, is to give up<br />\nbeforehand because he thinks he's going to be<br />\nlicked.<br />\nThen here's to the success of baseball at<br />\nHopkins, the game which most men, who<br />\nhave played all the games and know them,<br />\nrecognize as, not only one of the most open<br />\nand beautiful games to watch, but, with the<br />\npossible exception of tennis, as the cleanest<br />\nand most sportsmanlike game we have.<br />\n<br />\nTHOS. G. CAMPBELL, '05.<br />\nA STATEMENT.<br />\nGENERAL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter:<br />\nDEAR SIR \u2014There has been a great deal of<br />\ndiscussion about the action of the Athletic<br />\nBoard in regard to the baseball and football<br />\nteams and it was deemed advisable than an<br />\nexplanation should be made.<br />\nBaseball was not recognized for two reasons.<br />\n1st\u2014There was no money to support the<br />\nteam.<br />\n2nd\u2014There was not sufficient interest mani-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nfested among the undergraduate students.<br />\nIn explantion of the first reason let me give<br />\na few figures.<br />\nThere is placed in the hands of the Athletic<br />\nBoard each year by the University about $800.<br />\nThis is usually divided among the four<br />\nteams of football, track, lacrosse and baseball<br />\nby appropriations of $200 to each team.<br />\nLast year however, the football team had a<br />\ndeficit of $79 extra of their appropriation but<br />\nthis was covered by the fact that the track<br />\nteam turned back $76 to the treasury since<br />\nthey made $242 at the meet held in the<br />\nArmory and the lacrosse team turned back<br />\n$79 owing to the gain of $321 from the<br />\nSwarthmore game.<br />\nThe. baseball team, thanks to the excellent<br />\nmanagement of Mr. Cambell turned back<br />\n$59. So all was well.<br />\nThis year the football was given their usual<br />\nappropriation of $200 and besides that they<br />\nhave a deficit of nearly $400. The lacrosse<br />\nteam will in all probability not have as successful a season as last year since the Swarthmore game will be played out of town and the<br />\n$321 made at that game will not be forthcoming this year. This means that most likely<br />\nthe lacrosse team will need more money than<br />\ntheir $200 appropriation.<br />\nThe track team so far, has been unable to<br />\nsecure the Armory for a meet and that means<br />\nthat $242 made last year at the Armory games<br />\nwill be cut off from the track team this year.<br />\nIf the Armory is secured one-half the gain<br />\ngoes to the Homewood. This team will most<br />\nassuredly need more than $200.<br />\nNow if the football team had just used their<br />\n$200 there might have been a possibility of<br />\nhaving enough for the other three teams, but<br />\nthe football team used $600 of the $800 in the<br />\ntreasury and with the fact that lacrosse and<br />\ntrack will probably need more, it simply<br />\nmeant that one team had to be dropped.<br />\nWhich one should it be? The Board looked<br />\nat it in this light. There was less interest in<br />\nbaseball than in any of the other sports and<br />\nbaseball was dropped.<br />\nFrom the Senior class, Mr. Iglehart was the<br />\nonly man who has been out for the team in<br />\npast years and he would be debarred this year.<br />\nFrom the Junior class, Mr. Hardcastle was<br />\nthe only man out last year. From the Fresh-<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nmen let us say, four would come out for the<br />\nteam.<br />\nWould it be right to drop track or lacrosse<br />\nfor baseball when only five undergrads. were<br />\neven out for the team and there are twice that<br />\nmany out for lacrosse and track? It would<br />\nmean that most of the men on the baseball<br />\nteam would be meds. or grads.<br />\nThe money paid into the treasury is paid by<br />\nthe undergrads. and surely it should be used<br />\nfor their teams as far as possible.<br />\nIn regard to the football team the only<br />\nmotion passed was that next year the captain<br />\nbe an undergraduate. There was no motion<br />\nmade or passed to debar meds., grads. or any<br />\nother department of the University.<br />\nThe sentiment of the Board was that the<br />\ncaptain be undergrad. a good coach secured,<br />\nand everybody who wants to come out for the<br />\nteam can do so. But the men who practice<br />\nfaithfully and regularly would not be replaced<br />\non the day before the game by some man who<br />\ncomes out with a reputation but who has not<br />\ntrained and who, previous to this, had not<br />\nbeen out for the team. The Board wants to<br />\nsee every man given a fair show and in the<br />\npast the undergrad. were certainly not given<br />\nthis in football.<br />\nNow, if you will pardon it, a few personal<br />\nreasons why we should have an undergraduate<br />\nfootball team.<br />\n1st\u2014It would save a bill of $190 to $200 a<br />\nyear for meals.<br />\n2nd\u2014The men could get out on the field<br />\nat least once a week, which is an essential.<br />\n3rd\u2014The men would train which has not<br />\nbeen done by the team in the past two years.<br />\n4th\u2014The players would be Hopkins men<br />\nwho would fight for all they were worth to<br />\nwin and not men playing merely for the love<br />\nof the game.<br />\n5th\u2014The team would be better supported<br />\nby the student body and its friends, and the<br />\nalumni.<br />\n6th\u2014Under new rules the game does not<br />\nneed so much weight as it needs speed and<br />\nhead-work, and by having practice on the<br />\nfield once a week a better team could be<br />\ndeveloped than by relying on the medical men<br />\nto work in the cage two or three nights a<br />\nweek.<br />\nTo summarize the team would be a better<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nteam, would be supported by the student<br />\nbody, and would be more successful financially.<br />\nIt is not right that the other teams should<br />\nsuffer on account of football and at least $190<br />\nof the $400 deficit this year was due to meals<br />\nwhich amount would be saved by an undergrad. team.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nJOHN MALLORY HOLMES.<br />\nCorresponding Secretary.<br />\n<br />\nJUNIOR VS. FRESHMAN.<br />\nAnother class football game has come and<br />\ngone and, as is usually the case, the Juniors<br />\ngained the victory. The victory was a hard<br />\nearned one, and both teams deserve great<br />\ncredit for their sterling exhibition of hard,<br />\nclean football. The victory was won by the<br />\nnarrow margin of five points, scored in the<br />\nlatter part of the first half. After a series of<br />\neven plays, the ball was in the possession of<br />\nthe Freshmen on their own 15-yard line; an<br />\nattempt to punt was blocked by Tilghman of<br />\nthe Juniors, and Street '08 fell on the ball on<br />\nthe Freshmen's 4-yard line. From there, in<br />\nthree line plunges, the Juniors pushed Bridgman over the line for a touch down. The attempt at goal failed and the half ended soon<br />\nafter. In the second half the playing was<br />\nslightly in favor of the Juniors, but the advantage was very slight. In this half '09<br />\nworked the prettiest forward pass that has<br />\nbeen seen around Baltimore this year; Bevan<br />\ntheir end receiving the ball nicely and gaining<br />\nabout 25 yards on the play.<br />\nOne of the surprises of the game was the<br />\nremarkable strength shown by the '08 line.<br />\nThe Freshmen were supposed to have a slight<br />\nadvantage there, but the Junior line played so<br />\nwell, that they easily offset the advantage the<br />\nFreshmen had in Michael, by successfully<br />\nbreaking three and blocking his punts. For<br />\nthe juniors Abel at right half played the best<br />\ngame, closely followed by Chesney and Bridgman. Chesney had the call over Bird '09 in<br />\nbacking up the line, and was in the main part<br />\nresponsible for the failure of the Freshmen's<br />\nattempted end runs.<br />\nToby Tilghman played well at left tackle,<br />\nand it was through him that the Juniors were<br />\n<br />\nable to score. For the Freshmen Gutman<br />\nplayed the best game.<br />\nFollowing the football game came the cane<br />\nrush and, contrary to general expectations,<br />\nthis was won by the Freshmen by 11 hands to<br />\n10. This was due partly to the fact that Bird,<br />\npresident of '09, succeeded in pulling the '08<br />\npresident, Wegefarth, over his head as the<br />\nwhistle blew, and partly to the fact that the<br />\nFreshmen were more successful in getting<br />\nhands on the cane after the time was up.<br />\nWith all the regard due to those in charge<br />\nof affairs, we must say that there should be<br />\nsome change made in the future, in the manner of running the cane rush, for there was<br />\nsuch confusion and debate in the counting<br />\nthat it was hard to tell who had a hand on the<br />\ncane and who had not. Moreover, the present<br />\ngeneration must be possessed of remarkable<br />\nsmall hands to get 21 good grips an a cane<br />\nscarcely longer than 3 feet 6 inches. The<br />\nFreshmen won the contest squarely nevertheless, and it will pass on to history as a victory<br />\nfor '09 by the score of 11 to 10.<br />\nAnother important event which was noticed<br />\nat the game, was the blossoming out of the<br />\n1908 class flag. This particular banner is a<br />\nwonderful creation of red, white, and what<br />\nnot, and with the respect due it we are somewhat possessed of the idea that its designer<br />\nmust have been under the influence of a welsh<br />\nrabbit when he produced a design of such<br />\nnightmare qualities.<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\nThe first call has been issued, the necessary notices have been posted, and Wednesday,<br />\nDecember 26th will see an enthusiastic bunch<br />\nof candidates out in the cage.

Such spirit is surely an answer<br />\nto the mistaken theory that spirit is wanting at Hopkins. The class<br />\nteams of last year were recognized as one of the reasons for the successful lacrosse year. They not only aroused interest but developed<br />\nmaterial. Without interest and a well-trained scrub a team is seriously<br />\nhandicapped. Let us hope that 1902's enthusiasm will be well repaid in the shape of another<br />\nchampionship team in 1907!<br /><br />\nHE gentle reader will notice in this issue two letters. One is the official<br />\nstatement of the Board of Governors of the Athletic Association in regard to baseball and undergraduate football; the other a letter from Mr.<br />\nThomas Campbell apropos of baseball. Mr. Campbell's letter is equally<br />\nauthorative. THE NEWS-LETTER believes there should be a baseball<br />\nteam if it is possible. Also it believes there should be no criticism of<br />\nthe J. H. U. A. A., in its attitude on baseball up to this time, it should<br />\nbe recognized that no team can be run without money. But it seems to<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER that money is the only consideration. It is to be<br />\nhoped that the undergraduate team idea will not be overworked. It has many advantages but<br />\nthe fact must ever be remembered that the graduate and medical departments have just as good<br />\na right on the teams (other things being equal) as the undergraduates. As a member of the<br />\nAthletic Board has said, \"the undergraduate idea can easily he run into the ground.\"<br />\nThere is no cause for excited words over the baseball situation; if there is need<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nof money for baseball let steps be taken at once, by every one, to raise funds. The writer was<br />\nmuch impressed by the fact that other colleges have taken a very great interest in Hopkins<br />\nsince the defeat of Lehigh and Virginia. THE NEWS-LETTER hopes that baseball will not be<br />\ndropped for there is plenty of material worthy of the financial backing of the students.<br />\n\"Money for Baseball !\"<br /><br />\nS we have said before in a previous issue, it is not exactly our intention<br />\nto pull up this or that skeleton which may lurk around the University,<br />\nor to continually point the finger of shame at the various activities which<br />\ngo to make up the daily life of the institution, but rather do we intend<br />\nto furnish a fair statement of the consensus of opinion of the under'graduate body and at the same time to bring out a really interesting<br />\npaper which will count for much in the raising of much lowered moral<br />\nstandards. \"But, 'now to business;' said Sue.\"<br />\nThe recent controversy which has arisen among the students as to<br />\nthe recognition of the baseball team has brought to our mind a question concerning the Athletic Board, that is, what does the Athletic Board really represent? One<br />\nhears on all sides statements as to the partiality of the board as to the unfairness and so on<br />\nuntil one wonders how the board ever were elected.<br /><br />\nWhen we acknowledge their election the<br /><br />\nquestion arises as to what consensus of opinion do they follow. Among the list of members<br />\nwe see that there are senior delegates, junior delegates and a freshman delegate but as far as<br />\ncan be seen the only thing necessary for their election is that they belong to their respective<br />\nclasses. Do they then necessarily represent the members of their class. According to the<br />\npresent system of election we do not think so. The delegates are elected by the members of<br />\nthe University in toto and it matters little if the class which the delegate is going to represent<br />\nis for or against the one elected. Consequently the delegates of the various classes do not in<br />\nany way represent the opinions of their classes and are in no way bound to carry out any of<br />\nthe plans which that class may see fit to suggest. To my mind this mode of procedure is not<br />\nexactly just to say the least.<br />\nA better plan might be to have the various classes elect their own delegates separately<br />\nand have it understood that these delegates are to follow the expression of opinion of that<br />\nclass. How far it would be beneficial to carry this out is a question which we will not undertake to state here.<br />\nIt is obviously necessary that something must be done in this direction on account of<br />\nthe hammering that the Athletic Board has been receiving in the last two years. Last year<br />\non account of the track team and this year on account of this baseball question. While we<br />\nknow that there will always be complainers, would it not be better to do something to hush<br />\nthis continual knocking than to let things run on as they are? It would be better in our<br />\nopinion to have these delegates elected at the same time as the other officers of the class.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., December 13, 1906.<br />\nMR. CARL BERNHARDT,<br />\nEditor-in-Chief of the NEWS-LETTER,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nDEAR SIR :<br />\nNow that the football team has completed its schedule, and the Lacrosse candidates<br />\nought to be beginning to take up their sticks again so as to get into practice for the coming<br />\nseason, we, the undersigned, take this opportunity to come to the front and congratulate the<br />\npersonnel and candidates of the team of 1906 on bringing back the Championship Lacrosse<br />\nBanner to its proper place\u2014in our Trophy Room. Those of us who saw the final contest<br />\nwith Swarthmore were impressed with the good-fellowship and spirit which prevailed in the<br />\nranks of our team; and also by the article of play which was delivered. All we can say is<br />\n\"Good work\" for 1906.<br />\nAt this time we take the liberty to sound a note of warning: \"Do not get chesty;\"<br />\nSwarthmore's team of last Spring will not be able to hold a candle to the same team this next<br />\nSpring. A word to the wise is sufficient.<br />\nHaving indulged in a little preliminary discourse, we will now turn to the real object<br />\nof this letter. The Lacrosse Team of 1902 being satisfied both that its attempt to encourage<br />\nthe beginners met with success last Spring; and that many of the new men, who may have<br />\nfallen by the way-side, were kept at practice, it is again willing to donate twelve silver ioving<br />\ncups to the student body of the Johns Hopkins University. These to be presented to the<br />\nplayers of the team carrying off the palm of victory in two out of a series of three lacrosse<br />\ngames to be played between the Junior and Freshman classes.<br />\nThe condition to govern the contest to be as follows:<br />\nFIRST\u2014The parties to the contest shall be twelve players picked from the Junior Class<br />\non the one side; and twelve players picked from the Freshman and Sub-Freshman classes on<br />\nthe other.<br />\nSECOND\u2014The games may be played on any field the contesting classes may select.<br />\nTHIRD\u2014The games are to be played if possible in March and up to the middle of April<br />\nand on such dates as not to interfere with the practice of the University Lacrosse Team.<br />\nFOURTH\u2014Two out of three games must be played.<br />\nFIFTH\u2014Should any disputes arise between the two classes as to the eligbility o3 any<br />\nstudent, date and place of games, length of halves, officials, etc., it shall devolve upon a<br />\ncommittee consisting of the captain of the 'Varsity Lacrosse Team, the Physical Director of<br />\nthe University and the President of the Board of Governors of the Athletic Association to pass<br />\non such disputes. Whatever decission may be reached by this Committee shall be final.<br />\nSIXTH\u2014If it should so happen that two or more men should be called on to fill the<br />\nin the same or different games throughout the series, it shall devolve on the<br />\nposition,<br />\nsame<br />\nto select the player entitled to receive the prize.<br />\norganization<br />\nclass<br />\nWe suggest that the two classes appoint their respective captains at their earliest opportunity, so that these men may see to it that their candidates report to practice with the<br />\n'Varsity squad and thus raise the standard of the class teams.<br />\nBefore leaving this matter with you we wish to call the attention of the students, who<br />\nare interested in our future lacrosse teams to the fact that the City College Lacrosse Team of<br />\nlast year had a hard struggle to maintain its existence; owing largely to the fact that many of<br />\ntheir men graduated from that institution to swell our number at the Unfversity. Some of the<br />\nundersigned have spent sleepless nights and also class hours in trying to work out plans to<br />\nmake lacrosse a fixture at the City College. Shall we give up this valuable training school for<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nour teams of the future? We ask that you do all in your power to foster this year's team at<br />\nthe College; 'we need its members in our business.\"<br />\nTrusting that you will give this matter your attention in the columns of the NEwsLETTER, and hoping to hear from you that the undergraduates are ready to play a series of<br />\ngames under the conditions as suggested above, we remain,<br />\nYours respectfully,<br />\nTHE LACROSSE TEAM OF 1902.<br />\nB.

By some<br />\nchance the instructor of this course was<br />\nnamed Blinkensop, Ph. D. His real name<br />\nwas Holy Blinky. By chance, in the guise of<br />\na hurried and worried advisor, my friend<br />\nWarren Caruthers Carteret took this course.<br />\nPerhaps it was not chance, but assuredly it<br />\nwas not by design that \"Carrie\" Carderet<br />\nflunked the Christmas examination in History<br />\n7. \"Hence,\" as my friend 'Hooley\" puts<br />\nit, \"the trade winds.\"<br />\nNow it is remarkable how many people<br />\nliked \"Carrie Carteret. Dogs, men and girls<br />\nhad him for their friend and he had them. It<br />\nmay be doubted whether even the instructors<br />\ndid not in the bottom of their hearts, really<br />\nrejoice in his atmosphere. Even little crabbed<br />\nGuerber, the instructor in German 2, was<br />\ncheered when \"Carrie\" politely uncovered to<br />\nhim.<br />\nIt was true that Carruthers did flunk, but<br />\nit as he said was probably because Blinkensop<br />\ndid not approve of tweeds and cigarettes.<br />\n\"And now,\" said Carteret, \"I will thank any<br />\none for a simple paper cigarrette whilst I regale myself (and possibly you) with the tale<br />\nof the 'voyage de M. Blinkensop.'\"<br />\n\"It seems,\" continued Carteret, \"that at<br />\none time my friend Blinky, Ph. D.. was<br />\nselected as the historian of an expedition to<br /><br />\nthe West Indies. No. I don't know what<br />\nthe expedition was about, nor why the devil<br />\nhe was selected. But I do want you to understand that Edmund Thensaurochryson<br />\nichochrysides Blinkensop is a most religious,<br />\ncareful, conscientious, scrupulous person, and<br />\nthat is exactly why I didn't get through History 7.<br />\n\"Now on this expedition were, I should<br />\nsay, a very jolly set, even if they were doctors<br />\nof philosophy, and on arriving in port at some<br />\nfoolish island, which belongs to the British<br />\nthey paid their respects to the governor, who<br />\nwas lonesome in his solemnity, which consisted of niggers. And after consuming many<br />\ncooling drinks,(They grow mint on those<br />\nislands, don't they? If they don't I wont<br />\npatronize them.) they, as I was about to say,<br />\nbefore I interrupted myself, were invited to a<br />\nlarge luncheon the following day, which I<br />\nthink was perfectly sweet of the governor. I<br />\nwill thank anyone for another cigarette.<br />\n\"Yes, sir! They were all invited to this<br />\nparty, every man on board, including Holy<br />\nBlinky. Well, naturally, they all put on their<br />\nfine apparel and Blinky primped longer than<br />\nthe rest. So the men on deck, all glorious<br />\nwith white flannel and hat bands, waited for<br />\nBlinky. Finally Blinky appeared in a frock<br />\ncoat, red tie, duck trousers, a yachting cap.<br />\nIt was a great thing, he thought, to be entertained by the representive of the British.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n\"As for the governor, he was looking for a<br />\ntime. His niggers prepared a feast and had<br />\nfrom the cellar the most cobwebby bottles,<br />\n1798 Maderia, and all the rest of it.<br />\n''So Blinky, with the rest of them, entered<br />\ninto the long squatty house, over which waved<br />\nthe British flag. They were taken into the<br />\ndining hall immediately. It is true Blinky<br />\ndid insist on taking his hat and umbrella into<br />\nthe dining room. All these he craftily put<br />\nunder his chair. Nor would he remove the<br />\ncotton gloves. But these are mere details and<br />\nthey were all very polite, of course.<br />\n\"Well, Blinky had never tasted wine, but<br />\nthe heat of the day had aroused an unquenchable thirst. He drank all manner of cooling<br />\ndrinks, which looked harmless and tasted<br />\nawfully good, and then he got red behind the<br />\ngills.<br />\n\"Now just why the conversation turned on<br />\nRoman Government I can't say, because, as I<br />\nsaid before, they were, with Blinky's exception, awfully nice chaps. (Winslow was there\u2014<br />\n'Pinky' Winslow\u2014and he's a corker. He<br />\nwas my brother's roommate at college, and<br />\nthough he is quite a shark at history, he can<br />\ndrink like a fish and tell stories by the yard,<br />\nand his parlor tricks are killing.) But at any<br />\nrate they talked of Roman judicial proceedure.<br />\nThen Blinky pounded on the table with his<br />\nfist and demanded attention. Just to be polite<br />\nthey gave him room. Now if you can understand what a mixture of Bible and Roman<br />\nHistory and cooling drinks are you will be by<br />\nway of knowing what happened.<br />\n\"The Governor being a polite man only<br />\nsaid, 'Only fawncy! Quite true, but what a<br />\nbally ass, don't you know.'<br />\n\"At any rate, just as they grabbed him by<br />\nthe coat tails, Blinky emitted this: 'The<br />\nwhole of Roman judicial proceedure is summed<br />\nup as the Bible excellently and elegantly puts<br />\nit: 'Thou hast appealed unto Cmsar; unto<br />\nCaesar shalt thou go.' Then they tenderly<br />\nbut firmly withdrew him, not forgetting the<br />\nyachting cap and the green cotton umbrella.<br />\nSo W. Carruthers Carteret took a re-examination after Christmas. He was asked one<br />\nquestion: \"Describe in a few words the proceedure of the Roman courts.\" And after<br />\nten minutes \"Carrie\" handed in the paper<br />\nwith the following answer;<br /><br />\n\"The whole of Roman judicial proceedure<br />\nis summed up as the Bible excellently and<br />\nelegantly puts it: 'Thou hast appealed unto<br />\nCxsar; unto Cxsar shalt tou go.'<br />\n\"I am much surprised,\" said Mr. Blinkensop, \"to see the excellent grasp you have of<br />\nthe subject.

C. C.<br /><br />\nBASEBALL.<br />\nDecember 8, 1906.<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter:<br />\nDEAR SIR.\u2014I was delighted to read, in<br />\nyour last issue, an article advocating the recognition of the baseball team for this year. This,<br />\ncoming from a member of last year's team,<br />\nshows that the spiritfor baseball has not entirely succumbed, while at the same time it<br />\nproves that those who took part in the game<br />\nand know most about the matter are eager for<br />\nthe maintenance of the team, and fully aware<br />\nof the fact that it is not only possible to have<br />\none, but that it is the best thing and the only<br />\nthing to do.<br />\nThere are two reasons given for not recognizing the team\u2014namely, lack of interest and<br />\nlack of funds.<br />\nFor anyone to say that there is a lack of interest is as absurd as it would be immaterial<br />\nif it were a fact. If there's no interest\u2014make<br />\nit. Anyone who was present at the Lehigh<br />\ngame last year would have been a poor interpreter of human actions if he should not have<br />\nseen that the fellows were with the team, and<br />\ncrazy for victory and delighted when it came.<br />\nTo tell the truth, I believe there was more interest shown at that game than at any Lacrosse game last year, with the possible exception of;the Swarthmore game, for which I cannot speak as I was not fortunate enough to be<br />\npresent, being at the time at Charlottesville<br />\nwhere we enjoyed another glorious victory.<br />\nBut whatever might have been the real feeling in the matter, the fact remains that there<br />\nwere as many fellows present at the baseball<br />\ngames, and as much rooting, if not more,<br />\nthan at the Lacrosse games.<br />\nSomeone might say: \"Oh, yes, when we<br />\nhave a team, the fellows come out to see the<br />\ngames, but they are not interested enough to<br />\ntry for the team, etc., etc.\" All of which is<br />\nagain absurd, and contrary to fact. We had<br />\nsomething like fifteen or twenty candidates<br />\nlast year. Some of these, it is true, were not<br />\nup to the standard, but the fact remains that<br />\nthey had the spirit to come out. What's more,<br />\nat least half the fellows are back again, and<br />\nthere are other good men who said they would<br />\ncome out this year. All that is needed now,<br />\nis a manager to arrange a schedule and to<br />\ndrum up players, but he's needed immediately.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThe objection that there are not enough<br />\nfunds to run a baseball team together with the<br />\nother teams, of course is a different matter,<br />\nand can best be decided by the Athletic Board\u2014<br />\nfor they know what money they have and for<br />\nwhat it is to be spent.<br />\nStill, I think if they make a careful study<br />\nof the thing they will come to the conclusion<br />\nthat a baseball team can easily be recognized<br />\nand backed financially. To back up this<br />\nstatement we have only to look at last years<br />\nrecord of expenses, etc.<br />\nThe appropriation for baseball last year was<br />\n$225. Their actual expenses\u2014over gate receipts, etc.\u2014was about $157. This means<br />\nthat the team spent only $157 of the appropriation, i. e. $70 less than was authorized.<br />\nIf this could be done last year, it can be<br />\ndone this year. In fact, I think the team will<br />\nhave fewer expenses this year than last. Last<br />\nyear we had to buy suits which cost about $42;<br />\nwe had to buy a mitt which cost $5. This is<br />\n$47 which will not have to be spent this year.<br />\nBut this is not all\u2014for last year we played St.<br />\nJohn's in Baltimore\u2014or rather scheduled the<br />\ngame there. This year we would have to<br />\nplay at Annapolis, and would receive $30<br />\nguarantee which would more than pay expenses. We could get $40 from Navy, which<br />\nmuch more than pays expenses. West Point<br />\ngave us $125 last year, which paid expenses<br />\nall but about $10. They were very much<br />\npleased with the game, and asked us to be<br />\nsure to come again. I'm certain they would<br />\ngive a guarantee to cover expenses this year.<br />\nUniversity of Virginia gave a guarantee which<br />\npaid expenses all but 8 cents.<br />\nCertainly, from these few facts it is plain<br />\nthat the financial difficulty is more of a myth<br />\nthan a reality. Nor does the fact that the<br />\nthree games played at home failed to pay expenses, alter the matter. It must be remembered that these games were played\u2014two of<br />\nthem on Friday, and the other on Saturday<br />\nmorning. The only other game we had<br />\nscheduled at home was the St. John's game<br />\nwhich more than paid expenses by over $80,<br />\nand which would have paid still more had not<br />\nthe storm come up, and kept the people away.<br />\nI don't want to be \"butting in\" on anything that is none of my business, but as I am<br />\nvery much interested in the team, and as I<br /><br />\nknow the facts of the case, I thought it would<br />\nbe worth while acquainting the fellows with<br />\nthe same. While I think the Athletic Board<br />\nhas done what it deems best, I think also that<br />\nthey acted too hastily in abandoning the team,<br />\nand most inexcusably slow in electing another<br />\nmanager. They evidently have an erroneous<br />\nidea of the amount of interest in the game at<br />\nJ. H. U., and they over-estimate the expense<br />\nof running the team.<br />\nWhat would be the result if someone should<br />\nsuggest that we drop Lacrosse? There's not<br />\none of us who would not fight to the last ditch<br />\nto maintain the game. Its our game. In<br />\nLacrosse we're \"it.\" Just so will we fight<br />\nfor baseball. It's the game of America\u2014the<br />\ngame of all colleges. And, while we have<br />\nobtained more glory in Lacrosse, we feel that<br />\nthe baseball team has done, taking everything<br />\ninto consideration, as much.<br />\nLet us not then stand back and say there<br />\nare.too many difficulties to be overcome, but<br />\nlet us get together, have a team, and make it<br />\nsuccessful. The greatest pleasure and glory<br />\nis in doing the hard things. The weakest and<br />\nmeanest thing a man can do, is to give up<br />\nbeforehand because he thinks he's going to be<br />\nlicked.<br />\nThen here's to the success of baseball at<br />\nHopkins, the game which most men, who<br />\nhave played all the games and know them,<br />\nrecognize as, not only one of the most open<br />\nand beautiful games to watch, but, with the<br />\npossible exception of tennis, as the cleanest<br />\nand most sportsmanlike game we have.<br /><br />\nTHOS. G. CAMPBELL, '05.<br />\nA STATEMENT.<br />\nGENERAL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter:<br />\nDEAR SIR \u2014There has been a great deal of<br />\ndiscussion about the action of the Athletic<br />\nBoard in regard to the baseball and football<br />\nteams and it was deemed advisable than an<br />\nexplanation should be made.<br />\nBaseball was not recognized for two reasons.<br />\n1st\u2014There was no money to support the<br />\nteam.<br />\n2nd\u2014There was not sufficient interest mani-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nfested among the undergraduate students.<br />\nIn explantion of the first reason let me give<br />\na few figures.<br />\nThere is placed in the hands of the Athletic<br />\nBoard each year by the University about $800.<br />\nThis is usually divided among the four<br />\nteams of football, track, lacrosse and baseball<br />\nby appropriations of $200 to each team.<br />\nLast year however, the football team had a<br />\ndeficit of $79 extra of their appropriation but<br />\nthis was covered by the fact that the track<br />\nteam turned back $76 to the treasury since<br />\nthey made $242 at the meet held in the<br />\nArmory and the lacrosse team turned back<br />\n$79 owing to the gain of $321 from the<br />\nSwarthmore game.<br />\nThe. baseball team, thanks to the excellent<br />\nmanagement of Mr. Cambell turned back<br />\n$59. So all was well.<br />\nThis year the football was given their usual<br />\nappropriation of $200 and besides that they<br />\nhave a deficit of nearly $400. The lacrosse<br />\nteam will in all probability not have as successful a season as last year since the Swarthmore game will be played out of town and the<br />\n$321 made at that game will not be forthcoming this year. This means that most likely<br />\nthe lacrosse team will need more money than<br />\ntheir $200 appropriation.<br />\nThe track team so far, has been unable to<br />\nsecure the Armory for a meet and that means<br />\nthat $242 made last year at the Armory games<br />\nwill be cut off from the track team this year.<br />\nIf the Armory is secured one-half the gain<br />\ngoes to the Homewood. This team will most<br />\nassuredly need more than $200.<br />\nNow if the football team had just used their<br />\n$200 there might have been a possibility of<br />\nhaving enough for the other three teams, but<br />\nthe football team used $600 of the $800 in the<br />\ntreasury and with the fact that lacrosse and<br />\ntrack will probably need more, it simply<br />\nmeant that one team had to be dropped.<br />\nWhich one should it be? The Board looked<br />\nat it in this light. There was less interest in<br />\nbaseball than in any of the other sports and<br />\nbaseball was dropped.<br />\nFrom the Senior class, Mr. Iglehart was the<br />\nonly man who has been out for the team in<br />\npast years and he would be debarred this year.<br />\nFrom the Junior class, Mr. Hardcastle was<br />\nthe only man out last year. From the Fresh-<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nmen let us say, four would come out for the<br />\nteam.<br />\nWould it be right to drop track or lacrosse<br />\nfor baseball when only five undergrads. were<br />\neven out for the team and there are twice that<br />\nmany out for lacrosse and track? It would<br />\nmean that most of the men on the baseball<br />\nteam would be meds. or grads.<br />\nThe money paid into the treasury is paid by<br />\nthe undergrads. and surely it should be used<br />\nfor their teams as far as possible.<br />\nIn regard to the football team the only<br />\nmotion passed was that next year the captain<br />\nbe an undergraduate. There was no motion<br />\nmade or passed to debar meds., grads. or any<br />\nother department of the University.<br />\nThe sentiment of the Board was that the<br />\ncaptain be undergrad. a good coach secured,<br />\nand everybody who wants to come out for the<br />\nteam can do so. But the men who practice<br />\nfaithfully and regularly would not be replaced<br />\non the day before the game by some man who<br />\ncomes out with a reputation but who has not<br />\ntrained and who, previous to this, had not<br />\nbeen out for the team. The Board wants to<br />\nsee every man given a fair show and in the<br />\npast the undergrad. were certainly not given<br />\nthis in football.<br />\nNow, if you will pardon it, a few personal<br />\nreasons why we should have an undergraduate<br />\nfootball team.<br />\n1st\u2014It would save a bill of $190 to $200 a<br />\nyear for meals.<br />\n2nd\u2014The men could get out on the field<br />\nat least once a week, which is an essential.<br />\n3rd\u2014The men would train which has not<br />\nbeen done by the team in the past two years.<br />\n4th\u2014The players would be Hopkins men<br />\nwho would fight for all they were worth to<br />\nwin and not men playing merely for the love<br />\nof the game.<br />\n5th\u2014The team would be better supported<br />\nby the student body and its friends, and the<br />\nalumni.<br />\n6th\u2014Under new rules the game does not<br />\nneed so much weight as it needs speed and<br />\nhead-work, and by having practice on the<br />\nfield once a week a better team could be<br />\ndeveloped than by relying on the medical men<br />\nto work in the cage two or three nights a<br />\nweek.<br />\nTo summarize the team would be a better<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nteam, would be supported by the student<br />\nbody, and would be more successful financially.<br />\nIt is not right that the other teams should<br />\nsuffer on account of football and at least $190<br />\nof the $400 deficit this year was due to meals<br />\nwhich amount would be saved by an undergrad. team.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nJOHN MALLORY HOLMES.<br />\nCorresponding Secretary.<br /><br />\nJUNIOR VS. FRESHMAN.<br />\nAnother class football game has come and<br />\ngone and, as is usually the case, the Juniors<br />\ngained the victory. The victory was a hard<br />\nearned one, and both teams deserve great<br />\ncredit for their sterling exhibition of hard,<br />\nclean football. The victory was won by the<br />\nnarrow margin of five points, scored in the<br />\nlatter part of the first half. After a series of<br />\neven plays, the ball was in the possession of<br />\nthe Freshmen on their own 15-yard line; an<br />\nattempt to punt was blocked by Tilghman of<br />\nthe Juniors, and Street '08 fell on the ball on<br />\nthe Freshmen's 4-yard line. From there, in<br />\nthree line plunges, the Juniors pushed Bridgman over the line for a touch down. The attempt at goal failed and the half ended soon<br />\nafter. In the second half the playing was<br />\nslightly in favor of the Juniors, but the advantage was very slight. In this half '09<br />\nworked the prettiest forward pass that has<br />\nbeen seen around Baltimore this year; Bevan<br />\ntheir end receiving the ball nicely and gaining<br />\nabout 25 yards on the play.<br />\nOne of the surprises of the game was the<br />\nremarkable strength shown by the '08 line.<br />\nThe Freshmen were supposed to have a slight<br />\nadvantage there, but the Junior line played so<br />\nwell, that they easily offset the advantage the<br />\nFreshmen had in Michael, by successfully<br />\nbreaking three and blocking his punts. For<br />\nthe juniors Abel at right half played the best<br />\ngame, closely followed by Chesney and Bridgman. Chesney had the call over Bird '09 in<br />\nbacking up the line, and was in the main part<br />\nresponsible for the failure of the Freshmen's<br />\nattempted end runs.<br />\nToby Tilghman played well at left tackle,<br />\nand it was through him that the Juniors were<br /><br />\nable to score. For the Freshmen Gutman<br />\nplayed the best game.<br />\nFollowing the football game came the cane<br />\nrush and, contrary to general expectations,<br />\nthis was won by the Freshmen by 11 hands to<br />\n10. This was due partly to the fact that Bird,<br />\npresident of '09, succeeded in pulling the '08<br />\npresident, Wegefarth, over his head as the<br />\nwhistle blew, and partly to the fact that the<br />\nFreshmen were more successful in getting<br />\nhands on the cane after the time was up.<br />\nWith all the regard due to those in charge<br />\nof affairs, we must say that there should be<br />\nsome change made in the future, in the manner of running the cane rush, for there was<br />\nsuch confusion and debate in the counting<br />\nthat it was hard to tell who had a hand on the<br />\ncane and who had not. Moreover, the present<br />\ngeneration must be possessed of remarkable<br />\nsmall hands to get 21 good grips an a cane<br />\nscarcely longer than 3 feet 6 inches. The<br />\nFreshmen won the contest squarely nevertheless, and it will pass on to history as a victory<br />\nfor '09 by the score of 11 to 10.<br />\nAnother important event which was noticed<br />\nat the game, was the blossoming out of the<br />\n1908 class flag. This particular banner is a<br />\nwonderful creation of red, white, and what<br />\nnot, and with the respect due it we are somewhat possessed of the idea that its designer<br />\nmust have been under the influence of a welsh<br />\nrabbit when he produced a design of such<br />\nnightmare qualities.<br /><br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\nThe first call has been issued, the necessary notices have been posted, and Wednesday,<br />\nDecember 26th will see an enthusiastic bunch<br />\nof candidates out in the cage.
