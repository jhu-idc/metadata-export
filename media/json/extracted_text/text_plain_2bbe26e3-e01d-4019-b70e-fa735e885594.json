HOPKIN.S BASKETEERS _<br />\nBy LEN BUBINGER<br />\nThe sad performance of the Blue Jay quintet, last Tluesday night, against<br />\nthe comparatively untalented and ordinarqy inferior Towson crew was a<br />\nperfect illustration of the disadvantage to be had as a result of inexperience.<br />\nOur Homewood hoopsters, far and away the better aggregation potentially,<br />\nby virtue of the merit of its individual players, clearly showed a lack of<br />\nsmoothness and an inability to cope with a defense for which they were not<br />\nprepared, two flaws which can only be eliminated by continued practice.<br />\nAgainst the Teachers, who presented a variation .91.- the zone as their<br />\ndefense, the Hopkins' attack, which had been devised to be used in man-toman play, was highly ineffective. Thus, during the first half, the usual \"give<br />\nand go\" technique was found to be useless. Likewise, there was no under.baket scoring, for Towson was playing three men back in order to counterbalance the height advantage of the Blue.<br />\nIt wasn't until the second half, after they had been instructed by Coach<br />\nMallonee who had diagnosed the difficulty exactly, that the Blue-clad five<br />\nbegan to make headways. By placing their men and thereby making many<br />\nset shots possible, they drew out the Teachers' defense and set themselves up<br />\nfor inside throws. After a while, it was only a matter of time for the Hopkins<br />\nboys to become acclimated to their newly styled offense.<br />\nAs long as we're thinking of Tuesday night, we might review that J. V.Frosh scrap. Mr. McNally, coach of the Junior'Varsity, certainly has done<br />\nwonders in the development of his team. The weave has been well taught and<br />\nis well executed by members of his squad. With the material present and the<br />\ninterest shown, the Jay-Vees ought to go a long way this year.<br />\n. And don't let's forget that the same Mr. McNally directed the Freshman<br />\nquintet as well; and, although the first-year men yielded to their opponents<br />\nby a 30-19 count, they showed, nevertheless, that they too were well versed<br />\nin moving that ball.<br />\nTomorrow evening the Varsity five encounters Gallaudet in the \"Nation's<br />\nCapitol.\" The game should not be more than a good work-out for the Homewood courtmen, but it will give them an opportunity to work together as a<br />\n\u2022<br />\nteam and gain by another game's experience.<br />\n<br />\nlot lotrnal Weat<br />\n<br />\nr ito-ote\u2018y<br />\nGREYHOUND<br />\n<br />\nSANNANITZD<br />\n<br />\nor/gLia/ve<br />\nDO YOUR traveling over the holidays<br />\nby Greyhound.
