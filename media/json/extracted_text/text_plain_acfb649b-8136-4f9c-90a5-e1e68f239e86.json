In the interregnum<br />\nan administrative committee, headed by Dr. William H. Welch, had<br />\nacted as executive.<br />\nThe selection of Dr. Goodnow<br />\nhas delighted every friend of the<br />\nUniversity. When the\u2022trustees met<br />\nto consider the selection of a president, two alternatives were offered<br />\nwhich presented a difficult situation to solve. A man noted. for<br />\nscholarly attainments was desired<br />\nby some of :the trustees, while<br />\nothers wanted a business man, one<br />\nwhose chief service would be to collect funds and handle the details of<br />\nmoving the University to its new<br />\nbuildings on the Homewood estate.<br />\nAfter a consideration of the many<br />\nnames, suggested, the trustees finally<br />\nagreed upon Dr. Goodnow as preeminently qualified to fill the presidency. He combined the two types<br />\nof man they were seeking. They<br />\nknew him to be one.of the foremost<br />\nof American educators, one of its<br />\nauthorities on political science, and<br />\nhe possessed eminent qualities of<br />\nbusiness and organilation. For<br />\nthese latter attributes he was selected to serve as adviser to the<br />\nnew Chinese Republic.<br />\nThe only obstacle that Stood in<br />\nthe way of the Selection' of Dr.<br />\nGoodnow was the three-year contract he had made with China. This<br />\ndid not balk the trustees, however,<br />\nfor they had determined to secure<br />\nhim. Dr. Goodnow was called, and<br />\nshortly after sent a reply :that he<br />\nwould accept if he could be released<br />\nfrom his contract. The appearance<br />\nin Peking, China, of William W.<br />\nRockhill, former American ambassador to Turkey, was followed immediately by the announcement that<br />\nPresident Yuan Shi-Kai of China<br />\nwould gladly release Dr. Goodnow<br />\n<br />\nThe thirty-eighth anniversary of<br />\nthe founding of Johns Hopkins,<br />\ncelebrated Monday morning in McCoy Hall, was notable because of<br />\nthe official announcement of the<br />\nselection of the University's third<br />\npresident, Dr. Frank Johnson Goodnow.<br />\nThere, were, however, other features, which, had they not been overshadowed by the interest in R.<br />\nBrent Keyser's speech, would have<br />\nmade the Commemoration Day exercises the most impressive in the<br />\nmemory of present students of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nDr. Andrew Jackson Montague,<br />\ncongressman from Virginia, and<br />\nformer governor of his State, delivered a scholarly political oration<br />\nin which he said that President<br />\nWilson owed his career to his Hopkins training.<br />\nA remarkably striking portrait of<br />\nDean Edward H.

Calvin Chesnut, a member of<br />\nthe Baltimore bar, who was one of<br />\nthe first to study under Dean Griffin when he came to Hopkins 25<br />\nyears ago, delivered the presentation address.<br />\nDr. Welch accepted the painting,<br />\nand looking around for Dean Griffin, finally located him in a corner<br />\nof the platform. The Dean arose in<br />\nresponse to the tribute that was<br />\npaid him, and the faculty and audience stood in his honor.

It was<br />\nruled to hold all other candidates,<br />\nfor more elections will be held before June, when the three remaining seniors on the Board resign.<br />\nThis will probably be the most<br />\nimportant election in the next two<br />\nyears, for there will not be such a<br />\nwholesale loss of men at the end<br />\nof next year because of the fact<br />\nthat there is only one junior on the<br />\nBoard at this time. This election<br />\nwill probably take place just after<br />\nEaster.<br />\nAt the meeting the Board decided<br />\nnot to elect a man to the managing<br />\neditorship, but to assign the position monthly to a member of the<br />\nstaff, so that every editor would<br />\nhave some experience at collecting<br />\ncopy, reading proof and makingup the paper. Each editor, according to his length of service as a<br />\nmember of the Board, will act as<br />\nmanaging editor for four issues.<br />\nNo member of the freshman class,<br />\nhowever, will be eligible for the<br />\nduty. C. J. Weber, '14, will be<br />\nmanaging editor for the next four<br />\nissues.<br />\nThe resolution was offered by<br />\nMr. Corner and adopted after some<br />\ndiscussion as to details.

This<br />\ncomic has always endeavored to<br />\nexpress the real opinions of the<br />\nEnglish people in political matters,<br />\nand its Civil War cartoons which<br />\nappeared in almost every issue<br />\nduring the 1861-1865 period are<br />\nvaluable expressions of British feeling.<br />\nThrough the whole series of<br />\ndrawings, it was plain that the<br />\nartist had a thorough understanding of the American conflict.<br />\nWhen the Federal Government<br />\ngave up Mason and Slidell, the<br />\ncartoonist saw the act as the result<br />\nof an English threat of war.

The<br />\nnewspapers then were leaders in<br />\nthought, and the people believed in<br />\nthe opinions they expressed. The<br />\ncartoons portray these opinions.\"<br />\nOne of the cartoons depicted Lincoln as a bartender.<br />\nThe South was depicted on April<br />\n15, 1865, as a gladiator with short<br />\nsword and shield, finally overcome<br />\nby the North, a gladiator with trident and net.

The pitching staff has also been strengthened<br />\nby the addition of Gorman, from<br />\nCity College, and Diefendorf, who<br />\nshowed good form .at Central High<br />\nSchool of Washington last year,<br />\nand the catching department by the<br />\nappearance of Siebold.

In the interregnum<br />\nan administrative committee, headed by Dr. William H. Welch, had<br />\nacted as executive.<br />\nThe selection of Dr. Goodnow<br />\nhas delighted every friend of the<br />\nUniversity. When the\u2022trustees met<br />\nto consider the selection of a president, two alternatives were offered<br />\nwhich presented a difficult situation to solve. A man noted. for<br />\nscholarly attainments was desired<br />\nby some of :the trustees, while<br />\nothers wanted a business man, one<br />\nwhose chief service would be to collect funds and handle the details of<br />\nmoving the University to its new<br />\nbuildings on the Homewood estate.<br />\nAfter a consideration of the many<br />\nnames, suggested, the trustees finally<br />\nagreed upon Dr. Goodnow as preeminently qualified to fill the presidency. He combined the two types<br />\nof man they were seeking. They<br />\nknew him to be one.of the foremost<br />\nof American educators, one of its<br />\nauthorities on political science, and<br />\nhe possessed eminent qualities of<br />\nbusiness and organilation. For<br />\nthese latter attributes he was selected to serve as adviser to the<br />\nnew Chinese Republic.<br />\nThe only obstacle that Stood in<br />\nthe way of the Selection' of Dr.<br />\nGoodnow was the three-year contract he had made with China. This<br />\ndid not balk the trustees, however,<br />\nfor they had determined to secure<br />\nhim. Dr. Goodnow was called, and<br />\nshortly after sent a reply :that he<br />\nwould accept if he could be released<br />\nfrom his contract. The appearance<br />\nin Peking, China, of William W.<br />\nRockhill, former American ambassador to Turkey, was followed immediately by the announcement that<br />\nPresident Yuan Shi-Kai of China<br />\nwould gladly release Dr. Goodnow<br /><br />\nThe thirty-eighth anniversary of<br />\nthe founding of Johns Hopkins,<br />\ncelebrated Monday morning in McCoy Hall, was notable because of<br />\nthe official announcement of the<br />\nselection of the University's third<br />\npresident, Dr. Frank Johnson Goodnow.<br />\nThere, were, however, other features, which, had they not been overshadowed by the interest in R.<br />\nBrent Keyser's speech, would have<br />\nmade the Commemoration Day exercises the most impressive in the<br />\nmemory of present students of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nDr. Andrew Jackson Montague,<br />\ncongressman from Virginia, and<br />\nformer governor of his State, delivered a scholarly political oration<br />\nin which he said that President<br />\nWilson owed his career to his Hopkins training.<br />\nA remarkably striking portrait of<br />\nDean Edward H. Griffin, in academic gown, seated at his desk, was<br />\npresented to the University by the<br />\nAlumni Association.<br />\nW.

J.

Dorsey<br />\nRichardson, 'i6; Randolph Smith,<br />\n'17, and Fred P. Hall, '17, were<br />\nelected to the Board to fill the<br />\nplaces of the three editors who resigned. \\V. A.

It was<br />\nruled to hold all other candidates,<br />\nfor more elections will be held before June, when the three remaining seniors on the Board resign.<br />\nThis will probably be the most<br />\nimportant election in the next two<br />\nyears, for there will not be such a<br />\nwholesale loss of men at the end<br />\nof next year because of the fact<br />\nthat there is only one junior on the<br />\nBoard at this time. This election<br />\nwill probably take place just after<br />\nEaster.<br />\nAt the meeting the Board decided<br />\nnot to elect a man to the managing<br />\neditorship, but to assign the position monthly to a member of the<br />\nstaff, so that every editor would<br />\nhave some experience at collecting<br />\ncopy, reading proof and makingup the paper. Each editor, according to his length of service as a<br />\nmember of the Board, will act as<br />\nmanaging editor for four issues.<br />\nNo member of the freshman class,<br />\nhowever, will be eligible for the<br />\nduty. C. J. Weber, '14, will be<br />\nmanaging editor for the next four<br />\nissues.<br />\nThe resolution was offered by<br />\nMr. Corner and adopted after some<br />\ndiscussion as to details.

This<br />\ncomic has always endeavored to<br />\nexpress the real opinions of the<br />\nEnglish people in political matters,<br />\nand its Civil War cartoons which<br />\nappeared in almost every issue<br />\nduring the 1861-1865 period are<br />\nvaluable expressions of British feeling.<br />\nThrough the whole series of<br />\ndrawings, it was plain that the<br />\nartist had a thorough understanding of the American conflict.<br />\nWhen the Federal Government<br />\ngave up Mason and Slidell, the<br />\ncartoonist saw the act as the result<br />\nof an English threat of war.

The<br />\nnewspapers then were leaders in<br />\nthought, and the people believed in<br />\nthe opinions they expressed. The<br />\ncartoons portray these opinions.\"<br />\nOne of the cartoons depicted Lincoln as a bartender.<br />\nThe South was depicted on April<br />\n15, 1865, as a gladiator with short<br />\nsword and shield, finally overcome<br />\nby the North, a gladiator with trident and net.

This cat has been in our<br />\nfamily for over six years, coming<br />\noriginally from Uraguay Nviith a<br />\nwell established pedigree, and never<br />\ncausing us the slightest worry.<br />\nYour men came along the back alley with a big potato bag and almost suffocated our Clementina in<br />\ncarrying her to your workshop. 'I<br />\nwent after her and finally rescued<br />\nher. I wish to state that I have<br />\nnothing to say against the gentlemen who met me at the door.<br />\nThey were courteous, and promptly<br />\nsaw that my cat was refunded. But<br />\nI want to object to such treatment<br />\non the part of the ones who ran<br />\noff with the cat. It is a pity that<br />\nyotir college can't provide your<br />\nown cats to cut up and rip open<br />\nthe way I saw them doing through<br />\nthe window.
