Moreover, many<br />\nof us have a sort of feeling that our system<br />\nof medicine is the only one, overlooking a<br />\nconsiderable debt it owes to the Arabs from<br />\nwhom in times past benighted Europe learned many things of value. And these same<br />\nArabs had learned much from our distant<br />\ncousins the Hindus.<br />\nIn India to-day there are native practitioners who have excellent success in treating diseases with indigenous drugs, vegetable and mineral, prepared and administered according to directions laid down by<br />\nmedical authorities of past centuries A late<br />\nwork among the native treatises is a comprehensive compilation made some three hundred years ago. The Arabs of the eighth<br />\ncentury held in high esteem certain works,<br />\nstill in use, which were current in India before that period. The two oldest Hindu<br />\nmedical treatises, properly so called, are<br />\nprobably not later than the fourth century<br />\nA. I). Both of these, the one a treatise on<br />\nMedicine the other on Surgery, make mention of an older work called the Ayurveda,<br />\nwhich was originally composed by. Brahma,<br />\nthe creator, in one thousand chapters,<br />\namounting to one hundred thousand distichs, but afterwards condensed into eight<br />\nchapters out of consideration for the short<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nlives and small intellects of human beings.<br />\nThis unabridged Ayurveda was said to have<br />\nformed part of the Atharva Veda, one of<br />\nthose great sacred writings of the ancient<br />\nHindus. The reader's attention is now directed to this Atharva Veda as containing<br />\nsome indications of very old and primitive<br />\nmedical practice.<br />\nThe Atharva Veda in the form we know it<br />\nexisted before 500 B. C., but some of its<br />\ncharms evidently belong to a state of society<br />\nmuch more primitive than the state existing<br />\nin India at that time: it is possible that some<br />\nof them originated many centuries earlier.<br />\nFor a brief statement it may be said that this<br />\nVeda is a collection embodying popular<br />\nwitchcraft charms used, as the Hindus said,<br />\n\"to appease, to bless, and to curse\"; it is<br />\na sorcerer's book, figuratively represented<br />\nas \"a lean black man, sharp, irascible, and<br />\namorous.\" Among the beneficial spells are<br />\nthose used by the medicine-man in curing<br />\ndiseases, wounds, and the like. Inasmuch as<br />\nthe consideration of such practices is always<br />\ninteresting, and in the case of those of ancient India peculiarly fascinating and instructive, a few typical examples are here<br />\ndescribed. The sorcerer was called upon to<br />\ntreat diseases because in all primitive civilization sickness was looked upon as a manifestation of the power of some of the innumerable demons which were thought to be<br />\nalways ready to seize upon a man, often<br />\ntimes at the behest of the man's enemy who<br />\nmight have gained power over them. So<br />\nit was that the curative efforts were very<br />\nlargely directed towards driving away the<br />\ndemons of the disease. For the most part<br />\nthe sorcerer's attack was made on the most<br />\nprominent symptoms, without any real<br />\nsearch for the causes; however, such superficiality cannot be charged in two of the<br />\ncases cited here.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThree sorts of medical charms are presented: against poison, especially of snakes,<br />\nwhich were as much dreaded in Vedic times<br />\nas now, when 20,000 people die annually in<br />\nIndia of their bites; for the cure of wounds,<br />\nfor the Atharvan priests were especially<br />\nclose to the warrior caste; and against fever,<br />\nwhich has always been prevalent in India,<br />\nof course.<br />\nThe following three from a series of stanzas to be used against snake-poison are representative.<br />\n\"With my eye I slay thy eye, with poison<br />\nI slay thy poison;0 serpent, die, do not live;<br />\nback upon thee shall thy poison turn.\"<br />\n\"0 kairata, speckled one, grass-dweller,<br />\nbrown one, listen to me, and ye, black repulsive reptiles! Do not stand upon the ground<br />\nof my friend: cease with your poison and<br />\nmake it known.\"<br />\n\"I release thee from the fury of the black<br />\nserpent, the taimata, the brown serpent, the<br />\npoison that is not fluid, the all-conquering,<br />\nas the bow-string is loosed from the bow,<br />\nas the chariots from horses.\"<br />\nWhile the first of these was recited the<br />\nbite was rubbed with grass and the grass<br />\nthen thrown upon the serpent; or if he was<br />\nnot available, upon the spot where the biting<br />\noccurred. As he recited the second the sorcerer sprinkled the poisoned person with<br />\nwater heated by quenching it in burning reed<br />\nof a thatch. With the third a bow-string<br />\ntaken from the notched end of the bow was<br />\nfastened on the patient.<br />\nNext some verses from a charm employed<br />\nto cure wounds of all sorts. The practice<br />\nwas to sprinkle the patient at dawn when<br />\nthe stars fade with a decoction of a certain<br />\nparasitic creeper plant, then to give him to<br />\ndrink a mixture of milk and melted butter,<br />\nand finally to anoint him with the mixture.<br />\n\"Rohini art thou, causing to heal, the<br />\nbroken bone thou causest to heal: cause this<br />\nhere to heal, 0 arundhati!\"<br />\n\"That bone of thine, which, injured and<br />\nburst, exists in thy person, Dhatar shall<br />\nkindly knit together again,joint with joint!\"<br />\n\"Thy marrow shall unite with marrow,<br />\nand thy joint with joint; the part of thy<br />\nflesh that has fallen off, and thy bone shall<br />\ngrow together again!\"<br />\n\"Thy marrow shall be joined together<br />\nwith marrow, thy skin with skin! thy blood,<br />\n<br />\nthy bone shall grow, thy flesh grow together<br />\nwith flesh!\"<br />\n\"Do thou here rise up, go forth, run forth,<br />\n(as) a chariot with sound wheels, firm feloe,<br />\nand strong nave; stand upright firmly!\"<br />\nThis charm has attracted attention through<br />\nits striking parallelism to charms for the<br />\nsame purpose in a number of languages especially Teutonic. Thus from the Orkney<br />\nIslands is reported the following:<br />\n\"Sinew to sinew, joint to joint<br />\nBlood to blood, and bone to bone,<br />\nAttend thou in God's name!\"<br />\nA most interesting charm is this one<br />\nagainst fever.<br />\n\"Homage (be) to the deliriously hot, the<br />\nshaking, exciting, impetuous (takman)!<br />\nHomage to the cold (takman), to him who in<br />\nthe past fulfilled desires!\"<br />\n\"May (the takman) that returns on the<br />\nmorrow, he that returns on two (successive)<br />\ndays, the impious one, pass into this frog!\"<br />\nIn content these two stanzas are typical<br />\nof the many charms addressed to the fever:<br />\nbut of chief interest is the symbolic manipulation in which figures a frog. The Hindus<br />\nhad charms to quench fire, and in the magic<br />\npractice which accompanied these they used<br />\nwater-plants and a frog; and so the frog<br />\nfor the fire of fever. In practicing with<br />\nthe charm quoted the patient was placed<br />\nupon a couch and under this the medicineman tied by the arm-pits a frog marked<br />\nwith reed-like stripes, using a blue and a<br />\nred thread for the tying. Then the patient<br />\nwas washed off, the water going down upon<br />\nthe frog, who because he was cold and moist<br />\nwas supposed to take up the fire of fever.<br />\nVery similar to the practice with the frog<br />\nwas the method of using a certain charm<br />\nagainst jaundice. The patient was placed<br />\non a couch beneath which yellow birds were<br />\ntied with a yellow thread by their left legs;<br />\nthe patient was washed off and his jaundice<br />\nwas supposed to settle on the birds to whom<br />\nthe yellow naturally belonged: here it was<br />\nsomewhat the principle of like curing like,<br />\nwhile the practice for fever shows the attraction of opposites.<br />\nIn the manipulations which accompanied<br />\nthese charms the fundamental principles of<br />\nall magic practice are self-evident, yet it<br />\nmust be noted that the treatment is not<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nentirely magical in the treatment of ment is often close. The great value of the<br />\nwounds there is indication of the use of a Atharva Veda lies in the fact that it records<br />\ntourniquet to stop the blood-flow; and as many of these charms; and taking them in<br />\nfor bathing the fevered patient, that is good the light of the ancient native directions for<br />\npractice to-day in certain fevers: of course using them we are able to get an excellent<br />\nthese ancient Hindus did not rely wholly view of the attitude of a primitive people<br />\non the charm to cure sprains, stop hemor- .toward the invisible forces that come so close<br />\nrhages, and do other things which experience to our lives.<br />\nThe medical charms were<br />\nteaches even the most unlettered. It need selected for presentation here because everynot be doubted that often times, at least to one is bound to have some sort of interest in<br />\nthe mind of the physician, the magic spell medical science.<br />\n(tame to be of secondary value.<br />\nNOTE.\u2014The translations are from Dr.<br />\nIt would be easy\u2014but it is needless\u2014to<br />\nBloomfleld's<br />\nHymns of the Atharva Veda,<br />\ncite parallels to the practices described: it<br />\nand<br />\nthe<br />\ndescription<br />\nof the accompanying<br />\nis understood by all that the underlying<br />\npractices<br />\nadapted<br />\nhis report of them.<br />\nfrom<br />\npriDciples of magic practice are the same<br />\nthe world over, and even in details the agreeLE ROY C.

Dr. Osler has resigned from<br />\nthe Faculty of the University, and is about<br />\nto leave for Oxford, where he has been appointed Regius Professor. He was the central figure in the exercises. He made a<br />\nnotable address, and afterward received the<br />\ndegree of Doctor of Laws.<br />\n-McCoy Hall was utterly incapable of holding the great crowd of people who assembled at the doors. Only the professors and<br />\nmedical students and those of the families<br />\nand friends of the faculty who held cards<br />\nwere able to obtain entrance. hardly any<br />\nof the undergraduates, who had gathered in<br />\nthe corridors under their marshals were<br />\nable to gain admittance. Great dissatisfaction was expressed at the lack of foresight<br />\non the part of those having the exercises in<br />\ncharge which permitted such a state of afBesides the undergraduates there<br />\nfairs.<br />\nwere numbers of people at the doors who<br />\ncould not be admitted. It is unfortunate<br />\nthat better arrangements could not have<br />\nbeen made.<br />\nThe exercises commenced at eleven o'clock<br />\nand at that hour the long procession entered<br />\nthe hall, passing through double lines of<br />\nstudents and alumni. Professor Williams<br />\nwas the Chief Marshal; the divisions of the<br />\nprocession were as follows:<br />\nThe President of the University, the Orator, the Chaplin, Trustees, Guests and Faculty\u2014Professor Mathews, marshal.<br />\nThe Alumni and Candidates for Degrees\u2014<br />\nMr. C. Morton Stewart, Jr., marshal.<br />\nThe Graduate Students in Philosophy\u2014<br />\nDr. J. C. Ballagh, marshal.<br />\nThe Students of Medicine\u2014Dr. Thomas<br />\nMcCrae, marshal.<br />\nThe Undergraduate Students\u2014Dr. C. R.<br />\nMac Innes, marshal.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nThe spectacle presented by the gorgeous<br />\ngowns of many of the professors, and by the<br />\nvaried colors of their hoods was very brilliant. Dr. Osler, himself, wore an especially<br />\nrich gown of blue and scarlet and others in<br />\nthe line were nearly as striking.<br />\nWhen the procession had been seated, the<br />\ninvocation was pronounced by Dr. Millard.<br />\nDr. Remsen then introduced Dr. Osler as<br />\norator of the day, saying:<br />\n\"Unfortunate circumstances, over which<br />\nthe authorities of Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhave had no control, have made it appear<br />\ndesirous for one of our number to leave us.<br />\nThis is not the time nor the occasion to repeat what he has done for the University.<br />\nI don't care to say more than to declare<br />\nthat this is 'Osler day.'\"<br />\nThat it was indeed Oster day was shown<br />\nby the enthusiasm with which Dr. Osier was<br />\ngreeted when he rose to speak. His address<br />\nwas particularly notable, and full of strikingly original ideas, some of which have<br />\nsince been warmly discussed by the American press.<br />\nAmong other innovations he<br />\nsuggested a national and international exchange of teachers among the colleges of<br />\nEurope and America. Even an exchange<br />\nof college presidents, he thought, might be<br />\nan advantage, and for this purpose he suggested an international university clearing<br />\nhouse. Something in the line of exchanging<br />\nprofessors between colleges has already been<br />\ntried, and the practice should not be hard to<br />\nestablish.<br />\nDr. Osler then went on to speak of the<br />\ncomparative usefulness of man after and before 40 and after 60. He said that he had<br />\ntwo fixed ideas, and proceeded to speak of<br />\nthem as follows:<br />\n\"The first is the comparative uselessness<br />\nof men above 40 years of age. This may<br />\nseem shocking, and yet, read aright, the<br />\nworld's history bears out the statement.<br />\nTake the sum of human achievement in action, in science, in art, in literature\u2014subtract the work of the men above 40, and<br />\nwhile we should miss great treasures, even<br />\npriceless treasures, we would practically be<br />\nwhere we are to-day. It is difficult to name<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\na great and far-reaching conquest of the<br />\nmind which has not been given to the world<br />\nby a man on whose back the sun was still<br />\nshining. The effective, moving, vitalizing<br />\nwork of the world is done between the ages<br />\nof 25 and 40\u2014these 15 golden years of plenty, the anabolic or constructive period, in<br />\nwhich there is always a balance in the mental bank and the credit is still good. To<br />\nmodify an old saying, a man is sane morally<br />\nat 30, rich mentally at 40, wise spiritually<br />\nat 50\u2014or never. The young men should be<br />\nencouraged and afforded every possible<br />\nchance to show what is in them.

Under such a deluge,<br />\nof printers' ink, most men would have been<br />\nforced to\u2014well, chloroform themselves. But<br />\nDr. Osler has not quailed.

For some unaccountable reason, we had always supposed<br />\nAmerican students far ahead of their English<br />\ncousins in this respect. Our disillusionment,<br />\nhowever, was complete. The literary style<br />\nof the British magazine was decidedly superior to that of nine-tenths of American college weeklies, and contained in addition a<br />\nsketch by one of \"Punch's\" foremost cartoonists. The price was but \"two pence!Perhapa we were not able to appreciate the<br />\ntrue excellence of British humor, but at all<br />\nevents, it seemed to us that in the \"funny<br />\npart,\" at least, we have the advantage of<br />\nour friends on the \"other side.\" The British student slang is so different from ours<br />\nas to be totally incomprehensible at times.<br />\nA multiplicity of such terms as \"Bajan,\"<br />\n\"Semis,\" \"Zulus,\" etc., made us wonder<br />\nsometimes if we were not reading a South<br />\nAfrican publication.<br />\nThere is at present one place vacant on the<br />\nbusiness staff of the NEWS-LETTER, that of<br />\nAssistant Business Manager.<br />\nThis position is open to Freshmen, and<br />\nwhile it will not be filled until next fall, all<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nthose desiring to try for the place should<br />\nhand in their names at once to Carlyle Barton, Box 63, in order that they may be<br />\nassigned work to,do in competition for the<br />\nposition.

Enthusiasm in this particular<br />\nsport has never run so high at the University before, and the outlook for a tip-top<br />\nbaseball team this season is the brightest<br />\nthat we have had for years. The fact that<br />\nthis team is backed by the Athletic Association means a great deal for its success; and<br />\nfurthermore, it tends to make the men put<br />\nmore vim in their work when they see their<br />\nefforts are appreciated and supported.<br />\nWith the exception of the three men, Captain Crozier, Heckel, and Tom Campbell, all<br />\nof last year's team is still in the University.<br />\nThough their absence will be materially felt,<br />\npresent indications are that their places will<br />\nbe satisfactorily supplied from the new material now in the University.<br />\nAs a nucleus of old players around which<br />\nto form this season's nine there are: Boyd<br />\nand Randall, catchers; Brown, first base;<br />\nG. Campbell, second base; B. 13. V. Lyon,<br />\nshort stop; Bowie, third base; and Goldman,<br />\nStraughn and Baetjer, who cared for the<br />\noutfield positions.<br />\nThese men are all old players, and know<br />\nthe game well; and with the proper coaching<br />\nand the vacant positions filled, will form<br />\nan exceedingly strong aggregation of<br />\nplayers.<br />\nThere is an extremely large amount of<br />\nnew and promising material in the University this year, and it now seems that there<br />\nwill be no trouble in having all of the positions filled satisfactorily. Of this number,<br />\nthe more prominent are: Carter, from the<br />\n<br />\nVirginia Military Institute; McDonnell, a<br />\nWesleyan star, the same who played such<br />\na splendid game in the football eleven this<br />\npast fall; Lipscum, from Randolph-Macon<br />\nCollege in Virginia, who has the reputation<br />\nof being one of the best first-basemen in the<br />\nSmith; Waring, who was first substitute on<br />\nthe Yale nine last spring; Armstrong, of<br />\nPrinceton; and Brotherhood, of Dartmouth.<br />\nTo get a stock of good pitchers has been,<br />\nheretofore, one of the gravest problems that<br />\nfaced a Hopkins baseball team. It seems,<br />\nhowever, that this will not be such a drawback this year, since there is any number<br />\nof good pitchers on hand. Foremost in this<br />\nlist is Higgins, in the first year Medical<br />\nSchool. Higgins hails from one of the Kentucky colleges, and last spring succeeded in<br />\nmaking considerable reputation for himself.<br />\nBesides Higgins there are Crothers, of<br />\nPrinceton, and Captain Holmes, of the basket ball team, who made a good record for<br />\nhimself while in New Orleans. In addition<br />\nto this list, there are many more baseball<br />\naspirants at hand who may, with a lade<br />\ncoaching, be developed into 'Varsity material.<br />\nFor the present, regular practice will be<br />\ncarried on in the cage on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. This affords an excellent place for practicing fielding grounders,<br />\nand for a general \"limbering\" up; and by<br />\nthe time the weather permits outdoor practice, the coach hopes that all of the technical<br />\npart of the game will have been mastered,<br />\nso that particular attention can them be<br />\ngiven to the development of team work.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe election of captain has not yet taken<br />\nplace. This, however, has been purposely<br />\ndelayed in order that the men might get to<br />\nknow one another. In this way, the men<br />\nwill know whom they are voting for, and a<br />\nleader will be elected they will all gladly follow. The coaching will again be under the<br />\ndirection of Mr. Adkins, of the Medical<br />\nSchool. Mr. Adkins is well known in baseball circles in the University and in Baltimore. The enthusiasm he aroused among<br />\nthe students, and the team he developed from<br />\nraw material at the University last spring<br />\nare sufficient testimony of his ability as a<br />\nball player.<br />\n.Manager Griswold is still at work perfecting his schedule, and hopes to have it completed in a short time.<br />\nUnlike last year, the Hopkins baseball supporters will have the chance of seeing the<br />\nmajority of the games, since the fact that<br />\nthe team is officially supported will allow<br />\nmost of the games to be played in Baltimore.<br />\nAnother thing which is of vital importance,<br />\nand in which the management is to be congratulated, is that Hopkins will this season<br />\n(and it means much for the athletics) meet<br />\na better class of opponents.<br />\n<br />\nU. OF M., 28; HOPKINS, 21.<br />\nBefore a large and appreciative audience,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins basket ball team lost to<br />\nthe University of Maryland team on February 22, by the score of 28 to 21.<br />\nThis was the second contest of the State<br />\nCollege dhampionship series, and by the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland team winning this<br />\ngame, each of the institutions has one victory to its credit. This fact necessitates the<br />\nplaying of a third game in order to decide<br />\nthe championship, and no end of precaution<br />\nwill be taken in order that Hopkins may<br />\ncome off the victor.<br />\nIn the first half of the game, it was nip<br />\nand tuck between the two teams. It was<br />\nsome time before either got the lead, but<br />\nwhen an advantage was gained it was in<br />\nfavor of the Maryland fire. By hard persistent playing, it ran up a score of 11<br />\npoints. Hopkins now took a brace, and by<br />\nmeans of excellent team work, and accurate<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\npassing ran up her own score, so that at the<br />\nend of the half it stood 11 to 9 in favor of<br />\nthe University of Maryland team.<br />\nWhen the second half began, the Hopkins<br />\nmen seemed decidedly fresh, and began matters with a dash. Three field goals by<br />\nMcClure, Boyd, and Strobhar followed one<br />\nanother in quick succession, and it looked as<br />\nthough Hopkins was going to run away<br />\nfrom its opponents. This unfortunately, did<br />\nnot prove to be the case, for the good playing seemed to end right there and most of<br />\nthe six remaining points were made by goals<br />\n\u2022<br />\nfrom the foul line.<br />\ngoals by Hopstraight<br />\nthree<br />\nthese<br />\nWith<br />\nup, and soon<br />\nwoke<br />\nteam<br />\nkins, the Maryland<br />\nhad run up a score that was too great for the<br />\nHopkins five to overcome. It kept its lead,<br />\nand at the end of the game the score stood<br />\n28 to 21 in favor of Hopkins' old rivals in<br />\nathletics.<br />\nThere was no especial feature during the<br />\nentire game, but one thing worthy of note<br />\nwas the extremely ragged team work of both<br />\nthe fires. The individual work of the Hopkins players was very good, but the times<br />\nwere few and far apart when any signs of<br />\nteam work, which is such an important factor in the game, were shown.<br />\nThe work of McClure and Boyd in the<br />\nforward positions was good, but they were<br />\nusually covered up so closely that they had<br />\nvery few good chances to make a field goal.<br />\nCaptain Holmes played a hard, steady game<br />\nat centre, and Strobhar and Straus ably filled<br />\nthe defence positions.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nUniv. of Md.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\n.Blanck<br />\nr. f.<br />\nMcClure<br />\nI. f.<br />\nSwope<br />\nBoyd<br />\n.Smith<br />\nHolmes.<br />\nHale<br />\nr. g.<br />\nStrobhar<br />\nThompson<br />\n1. g.<br />\nStraus<br />\nOfficials\u2014Referee, Orchad, Johns Hopkins Medical School.

Because<br />\nHopkins has almost evory year a<br />\nchampionship team, and the large colleges<br />\nwould rather play us. Because we win from<br />\nColumbia by 17 to 1 do they stop playing us?<br />\nNo; they come back at us every year. There<br />\nis no reason why Hopkins should not play<br />\nthe big colleges in football and baseball.<br />\nTrue enough we are greatly handicapped in<br />\nnot having an athletic field, but we overcome<br />\nthose difficulties in lacrosse, why not overcome them in baseball and football?<br />\nI heard to my very great surprise that it<br />\nwas said by one in our midst that Hopkins<br />\nshould not play U. of Penn. in football next<br />\nfall, and the reason given was that it would<br />\nbe rubbed in on us too hard. Why, it is<br />\nmore of an honor to men to play Pennsylvania than win from some unheard of almost<br />\nprep. school. Does Cornell, because she was<br />\nbeaten by 40 goals in basket ball by Yale,<br />\nnot arrange a game with Yale again, or because she is badly beaten in football does<br />\nshe not arrange a game with the same college again? The idea here seems to be we<br />\nmust win, and if we are defeated, why, we<br />\nare no good. However, I believe I am giving the sentiment of the whole student body<br />\nwhen I say, arrange big games. It is up to<br />\nthe managers of the teams. A good schedule<br />\nbrings out good men, and they work harder<br />\nfor the team. We will have a good baseball<br />\nteam, and when we play Bucknell, Syracuse,<br />\nand University of Virginia, our team will<br />\nbe heard from favorably. There is no reason why we should not play Pennsylvania,<br />\nSwarthmore, Princeton, and any big college<br />\nif it is not too late to arrange the game. It<br />\nis up to the manager of the football team to<br />\narrange big games, and then to the captain<br />\nto develop the team. With such a captain<br />\nas Betts, and most of this year's team back,<br />\nwhich, by the way, was rather hard to beat.<br />\nWe can then say that Hopkins meets the big<br />\ncolleges, not only in lacrosse and track, but<br />\nin football, baseball, and basket ball as well.<br />\n<br />\nThe Alumni Association held its regular<br />\nannual meeting before the exercises on February 25, in Room 11, McCoy Hall.

Moreover, many<br />\nof us have a sort of feeling that our system<br />\nof medicine is the only one, overlooking a<br />\nconsiderable debt it owes to the Arabs from<br />\nwhom in times past benighted Europe learned many things of value. And these same<br />\nArabs had learned much from our distant<br />\ncousins the Hindus.<br />\nIn India to-day there are native practitioners who have excellent success in treating diseases with indigenous drugs, vegetable and mineral, prepared and administered according to directions laid down by<br />\nmedical authorities of past centuries A late<br />\nwork among the native treatises is a comprehensive compilation made some three hundred years ago. The Arabs of the eighth<br />\ncentury held in high esteem certain works,<br />\nstill in use, which were current in India before that period. The two oldest Hindu<br />\nmedical treatises, properly so called, are<br />\nprobably not later than the fourth century<br />\nA. I). Both of these, the one a treatise on<br />\nMedicine the other on Surgery, make mention of an older work called the Ayurveda,<br />\nwhich was originally composed by. Brahma,<br />\nthe creator, in one thousand chapters,<br />\namounting to one hundred thousand distichs, but afterwards condensed into eight<br />\nchapters out of consideration for the short<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nlives and small intellects of human beings.<br />\nThis unabridged Ayurveda was said to have<br />\nformed part of the Atharva Veda, one of<br />\nthose great sacred writings of the ancient<br />\nHindus. The reader's attention is now directed to this Atharva Veda as containing<br />\nsome indications of very old and primitive<br />\nmedical practice.<br />\nThe Atharva Veda in the form we know it<br />\nexisted before 500 B. C., but some of its<br />\ncharms evidently belong to a state of society<br />\nmuch more primitive than the state existing<br />\nin India at that time: it is possible that some<br />\nof them originated many centuries earlier.<br />\nFor a brief statement it may be said that this<br />\nVeda is a collection embodying popular<br />\nwitchcraft charms used, as the Hindus said,<br />\n\"to appease, to bless, and to curse\"; it is<br />\na sorcerer's book, figuratively represented<br />\nas \"a lean black man, sharp, irascible, and<br />\namorous.\" Among the beneficial spells are<br />\nthose used by the medicine-man in curing<br />\ndiseases, wounds, and the like. Inasmuch as<br />\nthe consideration of such practices is always<br />\ninteresting, and in the case of those of ancient India peculiarly fascinating and instructive, a few typical examples are here<br />\ndescribed. The sorcerer was called upon to<br />\ntreat diseases because in all primitive civilization sickness was looked upon as a manifestation of the power of some of the innumerable demons which were thought to be<br />\nalways ready to seize upon a man, often<br />\ntimes at the behest of the man's enemy who<br />\nmight have gained power over them. So<br />\nit was that the curative efforts were very<br />\nlargely directed towards driving away the<br />\ndemons of the disease. For the most part<br />\nthe sorcerer's attack was made on the most<br />\nprominent symptoms, without any real<br />\nsearch for the causes; however, such superficiality cannot be charged in two of the<br />\ncases cited here.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThree sorts of medical charms are presented: against poison, especially of snakes,<br />\nwhich were as much dreaded in Vedic times<br />\nas now, when 20,000 people die annually in<br />\nIndia of their bites; for the cure of wounds,<br />\nfor the Atharvan priests were especially<br />\nclose to the warrior caste; and against fever,<br />\nwhich has always been prevalent in India,<br />\nof course.<br />\nThe following three from a series of stanzas to be used against snake-poison are representative.<br />\n\"With my eye I slay thy eye, with poison<br />\nI slay thy poison;0 serpent, die, do not live;<br />\nback upon thee shall thy poison turn.\"<br />\n\"0 kairata, speckled one, grass-dweller,<br />\nbrown one, listen to me, and ye, black repulsive reptiles! Do not stand upon the ground<br />\nof my friend: cease with your poison and<br />\nmake it known.\"<br />\n\"I release thee from the fury of the black<br />\nserpent, the taimata, the brown serpent, the<br />\npoison that is not fluid, the all-conquering,<br />\nas the bow-string is loosed from the bow,<br />\nas the chariots from horses.\"<br />\nWhile the first of these was recited the<br />\nbite was rubbed with grass and the grass<br />\nthen thrown upon the serpent; or if he was<br />\nnot available, upon the spot where the biting<br />\noccurred. As he recited the second the sorcerer sprinkled the poisoned person with<br />\nwater heated by quenching it in burning reed<br />\nof a thatch. With the third a bow-string<br />\ntaken from the notched end of the bow was<br />\nfastened on the patient.<br />\nNext some verses from a charm employed<br />\nto cure wounds of all sorts. The practice<br />\nwas to sprinkle the patient at dawn when<br />\nthe stars fade with a decoction of a certain<br />\nparasitic creeper plant, then to give him to<br />\ndrink a mixture of milk and melted butter,<br />\nand finally to anoint him with the mixture.<br />\n\"Rohini art thou, causing to heal, the<br />\nbroken bone thou causest to heal: cause this<br />\nhere to heal, 0 arundhati!\"<br />\n\"That bone of thine, which, injured and<br />\nburst, exists in thy person, Dhatar shall<br />\nkindly knit together again,joint with joint!\"<br />\n\"Thy marrow shall unite with marrow,<br />\nand thy joint with joint; the part of thy<br />\nflesh that has fallen off, and thy bone shall<br />\ngrow together again!\"<br />\n\"Thy marrow shall be joined together<br />\nwith marrow, thy skin with skin! thy blood,<br /><br />\nthy bone shall grow, thy flesh grow together<br />\nwith flesh!\"<br />\n\"Do thou here rise up, go forth, run forth,<br />\n(as) a chariot with sound wheels, firm feloe,<br />\nand strong nave; stand upright firmly!\"<br />\nThis charm has attracted attention through<br />\nits striking parallelism to charms for the<br />\nsame purpose in a number of languages especially Teutonic. Thus from the Orkney<br />\nIslands is reported the following:<br />\n\"Sinew to sinew, joint to joint<br />\nBlood to blood, and bone to bone,<br />\nAttend thou in God's name!\"<br />\nA most interesting charm is this one<br />\nagainst fever.<br />\n\"Homage (be) to the deliriously hot, the<br />\nshaking, exciting, impetuous (takman)!<br />\nHomage to the cold (takman), to him who in<br />\nthe past fulfilled desires!\"<br />\n\"May (the takman) that returns on the<br />\nmorrow, he that returns on two (successive)<br />\ndays, the impious one, pass into this frog!\"<br />\nIn content these two stanzas are typical<br />\nof the many charms addressed to the fever:<br />\nbut of chief interest is the symbolic manipulation in which figures a frog. The Hindus<br />\nhad charms to quench fire, and in the magic<br />\npractice which accompanied these they used<br />\nwater-plants and a frog; and so the frog<br />\nfor the fire of fever. In practicing with<br />\nthe charm quoted the patient was placed<br />\nupon a couch and under this the medicineman tied by the arm-pits a frog marked<br />\nwith reed-like stripes, using a blue and a<br />\nred thread for the tying. Then the patient<br />\nwas washed off, the water going down upon<br />\nthe frog, who because he was cold and moist<br />\nwas supposed to take up the fire of fever.<br />\nVery similar to the practice with the frog<br />\nwas the method of using a certain charm<br />\nagainst jaundice. The patient was placed<br />\non a couch beneath which yellow birds were<br />\ntied with a yellow thread by their left legs;<br />\nthe patient was washed off and his jaundice<br />\nwas supposed to settle on the birds to whom<br />\nthe yellow naturally belonged: here it was<br />\nsomewhat the principle of like curing like,<br />\nwhile the practice for fever shows the attraction of opposites.<br />\nIn the manipulations which accompanied<br />\nthese charms the fundamental principles of<br />\nall magic practice are self-evident, yet it<br />\nmust be noted that the treatment is not<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nentirely magical in the treatment of ment is often close.

Dr. Osler has resigned from<br />\nthe Faculty of the University, and is about<br />\nto leave for Oxford, where he has been appointed Regius Professor. He was the central figure in the exercises. He made a<br />\nnotable address, and afterward received the<br />\ndegree of Doctor of Laws.<br />\n-McCoy Hall was utterly incapable of holding the great crowd of people who assembled at the doors. Only the professors and<br />\nmedical students and those of the families<br />\nand friends of the faculty who held cards<br />\nwere able to obtain entrance. hardly any<br />\nof the undergraduates, who had gathered in<br />\nthe corridors under their marshals were<br />\nable to gain admittance. Great dissatisfaction was expressed at the lack of foresight<br />\non the part of those having the exercises in<br />\ncharge which permitted such a state of afBesides the undergraduates there<br />\nfairs.<br />\nwere numbers of people at the doors who<br />\ncould not be admitted. It is unfortunate<br />\nthat better arrangements could not have<br />\nbeen made.<br />\nThe exercises commenced at eleven o'clock<br />\nand at that hour the long procession entered<br />\nthe hall, passing through double lines of<br />\nstudents and alumni. Professor Williams<br />\nwas the Chief Marshal; the divisions of the<br />\nprocession were as follows:<br />\nThe President of the University, the Orator, the Chaplin, Trustees, Guests and Faculty\u2014Professor Mathews, marshal.<br />\nThe Alumni and Candidates for Degrees\u2014<br />\nMr. C. Morton Stewart, Jr., marshal.<br />\nThe Graduate Students in Philosophy\u2014<br />\nDr. J. C. Ballagh, marshal.<br />\nThe Students of Medicine\u2014Dr. Thomas<br />\nMcCrae, marshal.<br />\nThe Undergraduate Students\u2014Dr. C. R.<br />\nMac Innes, marshal.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nThe spectacle presented by the gorgeous<br />\ngowns of many of the professors, and by the<br />\nvaried colors of their hoods was very brilliant. Dr. Osler, himself, wore an especially<br />\nrich gown of blue and scarlet and others in<br />\nthe line were nearly as striking.<br />\nWhen the procession had been seated, the<br />\ninvocation was pronounced by Dr. Millard.<br />\nDr. Remsen then introduced Dr. Osler as<br />\norator of the day, saying:<br />\n\"Unfortunate circumstances, over which<br />\nthe authorities of Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhave had no control, have made it appear<br />\ndesirous for one of our number to leave us.<br />\nThis is not the time nor the occasion to repeat what he has done for the University.<br />\nI don't care to say more than to declare<br />\nthat this is 'Osler day.'\"<br />\nThat it was indeed Oster day was shown<br />\nby the enthusiasm with which Dr. Osier was<br />\ngreeted when he rose to speak. His address<br />\nwas particularly notable, and full of strikingly original ideas, some of which have<br />\nsince been warmly discussed by the American press.<br />\nAmong other innovations he<br />\nsuggested a national and international exchange of teachers among the colleges of<br />\nEurope and America. Even an exchange<br />\nof college presidents, he thought, might be<br />\nan advantage, and for this purpose he suggested an international university clearing<br />\nhouse. Something in the line of exchanging<br />\nprofessors between colleges has already been<br />\ntried, and the practice should not be hard to<br />\nestablish.<br />\nDr. Osler then went on to speak of the<br />\ncomparative usefulness of man after and before 40 and after 60. He said that he had<br />\ntwo fixed ideas, and proceeded to speak of<br />\nthem as follows:<br />\n\"The first is the comparative uselessness<br />\nof men above 40 years of age. This may<br />\nseem shocking, and yet, read aright, the<br />\nworld's history bears out the statement.<br />\nTake the sum of human achievement in action, in science, in art, in literature\u2014subtract the work of the men above 40, and<br />\nwhile we should miss great treasures, even<br />\npriceless treasures, we would practically be<br />\nwhere we are to-day.

The young men should be<br />\nencouraged and afforded every possible<br />\nchance to show what is in them. If there<br />\nis one thing more than another upon which<br />\nthe professors of this University are to be<br />\ncongratulated it is this very sympathy and<br />\nfellowship with their junior associates, upon<br />\nwhom really in many departments, in mine<br />\ncertainly, has fallen the brunt of the work.<br />\n\"My second fixed idea is the uselessness<br />\nof men above 60 years of age, and the incalculable benefit it would be in commercial,<br />\npolitical and professional life if, as a matter<br />\nof course, men stopped work at this age.<br />\nDonne tells us in his `Biathanatos' that by<br />\nthe laws of certain wise states sexagenarii<br />\nwere precipitated from a bridge, and in<br />\nRome men of that age were not admitted<br />\nto the suffrage, and they were called<br />\ndeponati because the way to the Senate was<br />\nper pontem and they from age were not permitted to come hither.<br />\n'In that charming novel, the 'Fixed<br />\nPeriod,' Anthony Trollope disdusses the practical advantages in modern life of a return<br />\nto this ancient usage, and the plot hinges<br />\nupon the admirable scheme of a college into<br />\nwhich at 60 men retired for a year of contemplatton before a peaceful departure by chlorThat incalculable benefits might<br />\noform.<br /><br />\nfollow such a scheme is apparent to any one<br />\nwho, like myself, is nearing the limit, and<br />\nwho has made a careful study of the calamities which may befall men during the<br />\nseventh and eighth decades.\"<br />\nAfter enumerating the evils and mistakes<br />\nattributable to the sexagenarians, Dr. Osier<br />\nd eelared :<br />\n\"The teacher's life should have three periods\u2014study until 25, investigation until 40,<br />\nprofession until 60, at which age I would<br />\nhave him retired on a double allowance.<br />\nAfter Dr. Osier had concluded his address<br />\nthe degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred<br />\nupon him.

He read several<br />\ncongratulatory telegrams from the Alumni,<br />\nand in speaking of Homewood, said that<br />\nthere were no new developments of interest<br />\nhi regard to it; he announced, however, that<br />\nwork on the new athletic field would be begun early this spring, intelligence which was<br />\nnot entirely new to the student body, but<br />\nwhich gained in value by its authoritative<br />\nconfirmation.

Of this number,<br />\nthe more prominent are: Carter, from the<br /><br />\nVirginia Military Institute; McDonnell, a<br />\nWesleyan star, the same who played such<br />\na splendid game in the football eleven this<br />\npast fall; Lipscum, from Randolph-Macon<br />\nCollege in Virginia, who has the reputation<br />\nof being one of the best first-basemen in the<br />\nSmith; Waring, who was first substitute on<br />\nthe Yale nine last spring; Armstrong, of<br />\nPrinceton; and Brotherhood, of Dartmouth.<br />\nTo get a stock of good pitchers has been,<br />\nheretofore, one of the gravest problems that<br />\nfaced a Hopkins baseball team. It seems,<br />\nhowever, that this will not be such a drawback this year, since there is any number<br />\nof good pitchers on hand. Foremost in this<br />\nlist is Higgins, in the first year Medical<br />\nSchool. Higgins hails from one of the Kentucky colleges, and last spring succeeded in<br />\nmaking considerable reputation for himself.<br />\nBesides Higgins there are Crothers, of<br />\nPrinceton, and Captain Holmes, of the basket ball team, who made a good record for<br />\nhimself while in New Orleans. In addition<br />\nto this list, there are many more baseball<br />\naspirants at hand who may, with a lade<br />\ncoaching, be developed into 'Varsity material.<br />\nFor the present, regular practice will be<br />\ncarried on in the cage on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. This affords an excellent place for practicing fielding grounders,<br />\nand for a general \"limbering\" up; and by<br />\nthe time the weather permits outdoor practice, the coach hopes that all of the technical<br />\npart of the game will have been mastered,<br />\nso that particular attention can them be<br />\ngiven to the development of team work.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThe election of captain has not yet taken<br />\nplace. This, however, has been purposely<br />\ndelayed in order that the men might get to<br />\nknow one another. In this way, the men<br />\nwill know whom they are voting for, and a<br />\nleader will be elected they will all gladly follow. The coaching will again be under the<br />\ndirection of Mr. Adkins, of the Medical<br />\nSchool. Mr. Adkins is well known in baseball circles in the University and in Baltimore. The enthusiasm he aroused among<br />\nthe students, and the team he developed from<br />\nraw material at the University last spring<br />\nare sufficient testimony of his ability as a<br />\nball player.<br />\n.Manager Griswold is still at work perfecting his schedule, and hopes to have it completed in a short time.<br />\nUnlike last year, the Hopkins baseball supporters will have the chance of seeing the<br />\nmajority of the games, since the fact that<br />\nthe team is officially supported will allow<br />\nmost of the games to be played in Baltimore.<br />\nAnother thing which is of vital importance,<br />\nand in which the management is to be congratulated, is that Hopkins will this season<br />\n(and it means much for the athletics) meet<br />\na better class of opponents.<br /><br />\nU. OF M., 28; HOPKINS, 21.<br />\nBefore a large and appreciative audience,<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins basket ball team lost to<br />\nthe University of Maryland team on February 22, by the score of 28 to 21.<br />\nThis was the second contest of the State<br />\nCollege dhampionship series, and by the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland team winning this<br />\ngame, each of the institutions has one victory to its credit. This fact necessitates the<br />\nplaying of a third game in order to decide<br />\nthe championship, and no end of precaution<br />\nwill be taken in order that Hopkins may<br />\ncome off the victor.<br />\nIn the first half of the game, it was nip<br />\nand tuck between the two teams. It was<br />\nsome time before either got the lead, but<br />\nwhen an advantage was gained it was in<br />\nfavor of the Maryland fire. By hard persistent playing, it ran up a score of 11<br />\npoints. Hopkins now took a brace, and by<br />\nmeans of excellent team work, and accurate<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\npassing ran up her own score, so that at the<br />\nend of the half it stood 11 to 9 in favor of<br />\nthe University of Maryland team.<br />\nWhen the second half began, the Hopkins<br />\nmen seemed decidedly fresh, and began matters with a dash. Three field goals by<br />\nMcClure, Boyd, and Strobhar followed one<br />\nanother in quick succession, and it looked as<br />\nthough Hopkins was going to run away<br />\nfrom its opponents. This unfortunately, did<br />\nnot prove to be the case, for the good playing seemed to end right there and most of<br />\nthe six remaining points were made by goals<br />\n\u2022<br />\nfrom the foul line.<br />\ngoals by Hopstraight<br />\nthree<br />\nthese<br />\nWith<br />\nup, and soon<br />\nwoke<br />\nteam<br />\nkins, the Maryland<br />\nhad run up a score that was too great for the<br />\nHopkins five to overcome. It kept its lead,<br />\nand at the end of the game the score stood<br />\n28 to 21 in favor of Hopkins' old rivals in<br />\nathletics.<br />\nThere was no especial feature during the<br />\nentire game, but one thing worthy of note<br />\nwas the extremely ragged team work of both<br />\nthe fires. The individual work of the Hopkins players was very good, but the times<br />\nwere few and far apart when any signs of<br />\nteam work, which is such an important factor in the game, were shown.<br />\nThe work of McClure and Boyd in the<br />\nforward positions was good, but they were<br />\nusually covered up so closely that they had<br />\nvery few good chances to make a field goal.<br />\nCaptain Holmes played a hard, steady game<br />\nat centre, and Strobhar and Straus ably filled<br />\nthe defence positions.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows:<br />\nUniv. of Md.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\n.Blanck<br />\nr. f.<br />\nMcClure<br />\nI. f.<br />\nSwope<br />\nBoyd<br />\n.Smith<br />\nHolmes.<br />\nHale<br />\nr. g.<br />\nStrobhar<br />\nThompson<br />\n1. g.<br />\nStraus<br />\nOfficials\u2014Referee, Orchad, Johns Hopkins Medical School.

If they should glance within,<br />\nthey would see a speaker on the stage busily<br />\nengaged in edifying the rows of empty chairs<br />\n\u2014and Mr. French. Although both teams<br />\nare confident of victory, neither is leaving<br />\nany stone unturned. Both are preparing<br />\nfor the war of words with the same intense<br />\nrivalry and class spirit with which they last<br />\nyear contested the cane rush. The dramatic<br />\ngestures with which the rival teams hope to<br />\ncapture the audience are being vigorously<br />\npracticed. Voice culture is at a premium.<br />\nAt the class debate last year, President Remsen, whose office is located directly behind<br />\nMcCoy Hall, spoke feelingly of having heard<br />\nmost of the speeches before their public<br />\ndelivery. This year, he will again be reminded of the Zoo at feeding time.

Because<br />\nHopkins has almost evory year a<br />\nchampionship team, and the large colleges<br />\nwould rather play us. Because we win from<br />\nColumbia by 17 to 1 do they stop playing us?<br />\nNo; they come back at us every year. There<br />\nis no reason why Hopkins should not play<br />\nthe big colleges in football and baseball.<br />\nTrue enough we are greatly handicapped in<br />\nnot having an athletic field, but we overcome<br />\nthose difficulties in lacrosse, why not overcome them in baseball and football?<br />\nI heard to my very great surprise that it<br />\nwas said by one in our midst that Hopkins<br />\nshould not play U. of Penn. in football next<br />\nfall, and the reason given was that it would<br />\nbe rubbed in on us too hard. Why, it is<br />\nmore of an honor to men to play Pennsylvania than win from some unheard of almost<br />\nprep. school. Does Cornell, because she was<br />\nbeaten by 40 goals in basket ball by Yale,<br />\nnot arrange a game with Yale again, or because she is badly beaten in football does<br />\nshe not arrange a game with the same college again? The idea here seems to be we<br />\nmust win, and if we are defeated, why, we<br />\nare no good. However, I believe I am giving the sentiment of the whole student body<br />\nwhen I say, arrange big games. It is up to<br />\nthe managers of the teams. A good schedule<br />\nbrings out good men, and they work harder<br />\nfor the team. We will have a good baseball<br />\nteam, and when we play Bucknell, Syracuse,<br />\nand University of Virginia, our team will<br />\nbe heard from favorably. There is no reason why we should not play Pennsylvania,<br />\nSwarthmore, Princeton, and any big college<br />\nif it is not too late to arrange the game. It<br />\nis up to the manager of the football team to<br />\narrange big games, and then to the captain<br />\nto develop the team. With such a captain<br />\nas Betts, and most of this year's team back,<br />\nwhich, by the way, was rather hard to beat.<br />\nWe can then say that Hopkins meets the big<br />\ncolleges, not only in lacrosse and track, but<br />\nin football, baseball, and basket ball as well.<br /><br />\nThe Alumni Association held its regular<br />\nannual meeting before the exercises on February 25, in Room 11, McCoy Hall.
