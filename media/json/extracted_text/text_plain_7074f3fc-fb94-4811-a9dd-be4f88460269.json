The<br />\nday foreign investors decide not<br />\nto continue the U.S. line of<br />\ncredit, said Thurow, is the day<br />\nthe dollar's value collapses and<br />\neconomic recession sets in, forcing Americans to take a 8-9 percent cut in living standards.<br />\nThurow described the U.S.<br />\neconomy as similar to the central<br />\n<br />\nnervous system of a drugaddict\u2014addicted to this influx of<br />\nforeign loans to maintain<br />\neconomic stability and remain<br />\nsituated within the growth tunnel,<br />\nand prone to severe withdrawal if<br />\nour supply of foreign loans were<br />\ncut off.<br />\nWere this supply of foreign<br />\nloans cut off, the U.S. would<br />\nhave to replace it with U.S. funds<br />\nby balancing the federal budget or<br />\nraising the private savings rate.<br />\nBy most accounts, said Thurow,<br />\neighty-five percent of all<br />\nAmericans want to balance the<br />\nfederal budget, but no majority<br />\nwants higher taxes or few government serices.

First, said Thurow, in<br />\n1980, the U.S. had a $30 billion<br />\nfarm subsidies surplus. As other<br />\nnations' farm production has<br />\nswelled, however, the US.<br />\nbecame forced to sell $30 billion<br />\nworth of manufacturing exports<br />\nto meet its balance of payments.<br />\nIn addition, as a result of the<br />\nLatin American debt crisis,, the<br />\nU.S. lost what were its biggest<br />\ncustomers in 1980.<br />\nFurther, because of the decline<br />\nin the price of oil, the U.S. shut<br />\ndown many comparatively highcost wells and imports more oil.<br />\nCheaper industrial labor costs<br />\nelsewhere have also moved many<br />\nU.S.jobs overseas, said Thurow.<br />\nThus, the U.S. lost its status as<br />\nthe world's premier economic<br />\npower, and shares center stage<br />\nwith Japan and Western Europe.<br />\nGone are the days when the U.S.<br />\nwas twice as wealthy as the<br />\nworld's second wealthiest power,<br />\nand eight times as wealthy as<br />\nJapan, in 1950.<br />\nAfter World War II, the U.S.<br />\nheld such a technological<br />\nsuperiority over Europe and<br />\nJapan that the advertising slogan<br />\nof the Boeing plane versus the<br />\nBritish Comet was \"our plane<br />\nflies, theirs doesn't,\" said<br />\nThurow. The U.S. had a better<br />\neducated and skilled work force<br />\nthan any other nation, he said.<br />\nNo longer is this the case.<br />\nAustria, Denmark, Japan, the<br />\nNetherlands, Norway, Swede,<br />\nSwitzerland, and West Germany<br />\nsurpass the U.S. in per capita income. Since they have higher individual and corporate savings<br />\nrates, they can afford to reinvest<br />\nin their industry in the form of<br />\nnew machine tools in ways that<br />\nAmerican firms cannot.<br />\nThe U.S. is creating a country<br />\nof functionally technological illiterates, said Thurow. In the<br />\nIBM computer manufacturing<br />\nfacility in Burlington, Vermont,<br />\ntechnicians are forced to teach<br />\nemployees Algebra I and II,<br />\nunlike in Japan and Korea. Consequently, this additionally cost is<br />\nnot factored into the cost of their<br />\nproduct, said Thurow.<br />\nIn addition, West Germany and<br />\nJapan graduate forty percent of<br />\ntheir college undergraduates with<br />\nscience and engineering degrees.<br />\nOnly sixteen percent of all<br />\nAmerican college undergraduates<br />\nmajor in science and engineering.<br />\nThurow said these data explain<br />\nwhy German and Japanese products seem to work better and are<br />\ngenerally more dependable.<br />\nAccording to Thurow one of<br />\nthe main reasons the U.S. is going into debt is that it will not<br />\nadapt culturally to meet the growing changes in the world<br />\neconomic picture. The United<br />\nStates has never had a powerful<br />\n\"counterculture\" with which to<br />\ncompete in order to improve its<br />\nproductivity.\" he said.<br />\nThurow urged change in the<br />\nmethods by which we educate our<br />\nstudents and train them to compete in the world of international<br />\ntrade, while appreciating and<br />\nrecognizing the strengths and<br />\nconcerns of other major industrial<br />\npowers.

On<br />\nthe one hand there is the importance of providing quality<br />\nHomewood<br />\nfor<br />\nteaching<br />\nundergraduates and the obvious<br />\nnecessity of English competence<br />\nfor teachers. On the other is the<br />\nUniversity's ability to attract<br />\nquality graduate students and the<br />\nhandicap that a spoken-English<br />\ncompetence requirement would<br />\npresent. Because Johns Hopkins<br />\nis an institution geared primarily<br />\ntowards research, it is the latter<br />\nof these two conflicting interests<br />\nwhich prevails. I contend that the<br />\nUniversity can and should take a<br />\nbold step in this area and develop<br />\n-a mutually satisfactory solution to<br />\nthis problem. Let me explain.<br />\nHopkins has a reputation for<br />\nexcellence in research and<br />\n<br />\ngraduate training beyond<br />\nreproach. Since the University's<br />\nfounding, these areas have always<br />\nreceived the greatest emphasis. I<br />\nbelieve, however, that because of<br />\nits outstanding reputation, Johns<br />\nHopkins can move to require not<br />\nonly higher scores on both the<br />\nwritten and spoken TOEFL exams(the latter of which should be<br />\nimplemented as a prerequisite for<br />\nadmission) but also the participation of all graduate students with<br />\nan unsatisfactory English proficiency in an on-going intensive<br />\nprogram to make them communicative as quickly as possible,<br />\ncertainly by their graduation.<br />\nOn the surface, this may seem<br />\nlike a great deal to ask not only<br />\nof the University, but also of the<br />\ndepartments, which depend on<br />\nquality graduate students to bring<br />\nthem research funds. And certainly, at first, it might impede<br />\nstudent recruitment. But simply<br />\n<br />\nbecause our peer institutions<br />\nchoose to continue to apply superficial solutions to the problem of<br />\nEnglish proficiency among teaching assistants, does not mean<br />\nthat Johns Hopkins must follow<br />\nsuit in the effort to compete.<br />\nThere is a dear need for leadership in this area, and if Hopkins<br />\nshows a willingness to provide<br />\nthat leadership, the reputation of<br />\nthe University will be enhanced.<br />\nThere are numerous reasons<br />\nwhy the University should take<br />\nthis strong stance, and do so<br />\nquickly. First, the cutback in<br />\nfaculty size to its 1982 level,<br />\nnecessitated by the A&S budget<br />\ndeficit, means that graduate<br />\nteaching assistants will have more<br />\nclassroom<br />\ncontact<br />\nwith<br />\nundergraduates, thus potentially<br />\nexacerbating an already poor<br />\nsituation.<br />\nSecond,<br />\nthe<br />\nSee DECAGNA, 8<br />\n<br />\nWhen the going gets tough, the<br />\ntough call home and try to find<br />\nsomeone to listen to them.

I can however provide the<br />\nanswer to Mr. Marino's question<br />\n(News-Letter, October 4th) as to<br />\nthe difference between South<br />\nAfrica and various other countries which he mentions. The difference is that South Africa is the<br />\nonly country in the world where<br />\na small ethnic minority<br />\nsystematically and with great<br />\nbrutality represses the majority of<br />\nthe population for no other reason<br />\nthan the colour of their skin.<br />\nMoreover, if Mr. Marino wishes<br />\nto expose the deplorable conditions in coutries like Angola and<br />\nMozambique he should be aware<br />\nof the contribution that the<br />\nUNITA and RENAMO terrorist<br />\nmovements make to these conditions. And does he know which<br />\ngovernment is responsible for<br />\nsupporting them...?<br />\nChris Smaje<br />\n<br />\nA critical tool<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nSomething of a political discussion awakens in the pages of the<br />\nNews-Letter! I found Jim<br />\nMarino's response to Patrick<br />\nBond to be partially insightful,<br />\nbut lacking a significant, struc-<br />\n<br />\npseudo: phoning home<br />\ntured approach to political<br />\neconomy. Yes, most governments are hierarchical and oppressive; not even frosh need to<br />\nread the News-Letter to know<br />\nthat. But why any specific<br />\ngovernment, in its geopolitical<br />\ncontext, abuses its mandate\u2014here<br />\nwe have the heart of the political<br />\ninquiry. Mr. Marino failed to address this central problem; instead he asked Mr. Bond to recant<br />\npart of a cohesive analysis. Why<br />\nless discussion, and not more?<br />\nI think that the Marxism which<br />\nMr. Marino is afraid to inveStigate (albeit \"Marxism\"<br />\nwhich Pol Pot et al misquote and<br />\ndistort horrifically) and the Marxism which Mr. Bond, myself, and<br />\nothers apply to world history is<br />\na critical tool in resolving the<br />\nshameful inequalities in our<br />\nsociety.<br />\nDaniel Plattner<br />\n<br />\nPSEUDO, from 6<br />\nnext to the garage, all that smoke.<br />\nI think he misses Mom.

Mom took it<br />\nupon herself to redecorate it while<br />\nhe was away on a business trip<br />\nlast year, all pinks and light<br />\nbrowns, but he's too tactful to say<br />\nanything. But then the family<br />\nmoved into the study for its cool<br />\ncouch and television.

While I do not dispute<br />\nthe excellence of the Johns<br />\nHopkins faculty, it is clear that<br />\nteaching by graduate assistants is<br />\nan important element of instruction here, and the fact that some<br />\nteaching assistants cannot communicate effectively in English<br />\ntends to lower the overall ex-<br />\n<br />\ncellence of undergraduate instruction. Finally, it seems highly intuitive that graduate students at<br />\nthis university, irrespective of<br />\ntheir national origin, should be<br />\nable, at the very least by the time<br />\nof their graduation, to communicate satisfactorily in the<br />\nEnglish language.

It<br />\noperates Monday thru Friday<br />\nfrom 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.<br />\n<br />\nTradition painted at MSE<br />\nby EricRuck<br />\n<br />\nAlthough movies such as<br />\nHairspray and Tin Men have<br />\npainted a rich picture of<br />\nBaltimore's heritage, until now<br />\nall chroniclers of the city's past<br />\nhave left out an important institution particular to our part of the<br />\nworld. But on Wednesday, October 12, at the Wednesday Noon<br />\nseries, Dr. Elaine Eff presented<br />\nher new film she directed and<br />\nproduced, The Screen Painters,<br />\nand held a question and answer<br />\nperiod afterwards.<br />\nThe painted screen is similar to<br />\nthe decorated screens sometimes<br />\nseen on the back windows of<br />\nvans, only they are generally<br />\nfound on rowhouse windows and<br />\nscreen doors. The hand-painted<br />\nscenes are generally more<br />\nelaborate than what one would<br />\nfind on the back of a van, and not<br />\nonly do they offer privacy to people whose windows are close to<br />\nthe street, but they greatly<br />\nenhance the appearance of the<br />\nneighbourhood.<br />\nThe most important distinction<br />\nof the painted screen, however,<br />\ndoes not lie in its appearance. According to Dr. Eff, \"Nowhere<br />\nelse in the universe can we find<br />\nthe painted screen as a contemBill Berger porary art form.\"<br />\nThis is the door and the brand new blue canopy of the Grad Club. But<br />\nAlthough many different subdon't take our word that it's blue\u2014go see for yourself.<br />\njects have been painted on<br />\n<br />\nscreens, most of them deal with<br />\nnature. Seagulls, ships, ducks in<br />\nponds, and red-roofed bungalows<br />\nin the country are all common<br />\nscenes, although each artist has<br />\nhis own style for each, and none<br />\nwould consider copying that of<br />\nany other. Some of the less common sights include a painting of<br />\nElvis singing \"Love Me Tender\"<br />\nand an outer space scene.<br />\nOne artist's personal favorite is<br />\nof a clipper ship, with a red hull<br />\nand full, billowing sail, bursting<br />\nthrough blue-green water<br />\nunderneath a stormy sky.<br />\nThe art was started in 1913<br />\nwhen William Octavek, a Bohemian, painted pictures of produce<br />\non his grocery store's screen<br />\ndoor. For the rest of his life, he<br />\nfound himself painting screens<br />\nand teaching others the craft.<br />\nLike other folk traditions, he<br />\npassed the art onto his sons when<br />\nhe passed away.<br />\nToday, the cost of having a<br />\nscreen painted can range<br />\nanywhere from $15 to $100. The<br />\nvariables include factors like the<br />\nsize of the screen, what kind of<br />\nscene is to be painted, and \"what<br />\nkind of car you drove when you<br />\ncame to their house.\"<br />\n_<br />\n_<br />\nIn addition to interviews with<br />\nthe last of the professional street<br />\npainters and owners, a number of<br />\nlocal celebrities appeared in.the<br />\nfilm.<br />\n<br />\n\"We did dozens of celebrity interviews. We talked to people<br />\nwho have national profiles, people who are known for their local<br />\ncolor, like Ethel Ennis and Mimi<br />\nDiPietro.\"<br />\n\"If you walk along in a nice<br />\nneighborhood and it's clean and<br />\nyou see the screens,\" says<br />\nGovernor William Donald Schaefer,<br />\nsay, \"what a nice neighborhood.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nUnfortunately, not all of the<br />\nfootage could be included in the<br />\nhalf hour film. According to Dr.<br />\nEff, many of the interviews just<br />\ndid not work.

Just<br />\nthe people who are painting the<br />\nscreens are dying.\"<br />\nAccording to Dr. Eff, the<br />\nreason why the film got off the<br />\nground was because two of the<br />\nproperties she wanted to document were sold, and one of the<br />\nscreen painters, Ted Richardson,<br />\nbecame critically ill with cancer.<br />\nHe died six weeks after the<br />\nfilming.<br />\n\"I knew this should have been<br />\na film. The right people and the<br />\nright times came together,\" she<br />\nsays. \"This is my way of thanking the screen painters and the<br />\npeople of Baltimore and giving<br />\nsomething back to the city.\"<br />\nAlthough not a native<br />\nBaltimorean, Dr. Eff has lived in<br />\nthe city since she was seven years<br />\nold. Her doctoral thesis at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania is on<br />\nthe folk art aspect of the painted<br />\nscreens of Baltimore. Her interest<br />\nin the art brought her back to<br />\nBaltimore and aided the creation<br />\nof her present job, the City of<br />\nBaltimore Folklorist.<br />\n\"I created this job because<br />\nthere's the constant tension bet- \u2022<br />\n<br />\nween tradition and progress,<br />\ncausing people to accentuate<br />\ntradition,\" states Dr. Eff. \"Some<br />\npeople say that all we do is glorify<br />\nthe mundane. But what are we<br />\nhere for in the city government?<br />\nNot just to badger people to pay<br />\ntheir bills, but also to reward.\"<br />\nIndeed, she is the first holder<br />\nof the position, instituted three<br />\nand a half years ago to document,<br />\npreserve, and promote local traditions. According to Dr. Eff, this<br />\noffice is the first of its kind in the<br />\ncountry.<br />\n\"The best part of this job is<br />\nmaking people feel good about<br />\nwhat might seem like a simple<br />\ncontribution to a complex<br />\nworld,\" says Dr. Eff. \"The<br />\nreason why Baltimore interests<br />\nme is that it is such a conservative<br />\ntown, that it holds on to its<br />\ntraditions.\"<br />\nThe film was cosponsored by<br />\nThe Painted Screen Society of<br />\nBaltimore, Inc., and Baltimore<br />\nTraditions; two nonprofit, public<br />\norganizations. Although it was<br />\nproduced independently of her<br />\ngovernment positions, it fits well<br />\nwith the job.<br />\n\"This is the perfect example of<br />\nwhat we do and how we do it,\"<br />\nshe says. \"My office exists to<br />\n<br />\nSpecial Offer for<br />\nHopkins Affiliates<br />\n<br />\nmake sure what is special to the<br />\ncity doesn't get lost.\"<br />\nThe actual office of which her<br />\nposition is a part is called Baltimore<br />\nTraditions, and it is part of the<br />\nDepartment of Housing and<br />\nCommunity Development.<br />\n\"I am the only full-time<br />\nemployee,\" says Dr. Eff. \"People work with us as contract or<br />\npart-time employees based on<br />\ncurrent projects.\"<br />\nAccording to Dr. Eff, much of<br />\nthe community work she did in<br />\nPennsylvania involved a number<br />\nof college students.<br />\n\"At the University of Pennsylvania, the folklore project has<br />\ncertainly enhanced the students'<br />\nknowledge of Philadelphia. I wish<br />\nwe had more students willing to<br />\ndo field work here.\"<br />\nPainted screens are not Dr.<br />\nEffs only passion. Some of her<br />\nfavorite sights in Baltimore are:<br />\nthe Boxer's Hall of Fame and<br />\nPool Room in Canton, the St.<br />\nMichael's Ukranian Catholic<br />\nchurch, where on Thursday and<br />\nFridays women gather to make<br />\nperogees and hardly anyone there<br />\nspeaks English, the St. Anthony's<br />\nFestival, which is a street<br />\ntion in Little Italy in honor of the<br />\nneighborhood being spared by<br />\n<br />\nEric Deutsch<br />\n<br />\nDr. Elaine Eff, City of Baltimore Folklorist, stands in front of a poster<br />\npublicizing her new film, The Screen Painters.<br />\n<br />\nthe Great Baltimore Fire, and the<br />\nmany markets, the most impressive of which is Lexington<br />\nMarket.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Eff, in order<br />\nto find the painted screens, which<br />\nwill be taken down for winter<br />\n'soon, try walking along North<br />\nCollington Avenue between the<br />\n800 and 900 blocks.

The program involves multiple races<br />\nwhich take place in the city's In-<br />\n<br />\nner Harbor. Thousands of<br />\nballoons are let loose in a<br />\ndesignated area of the harbor and<br />\nteams race in paddle boats to collect as many balloons as possible.<br />\nEach team is composed of 2 people from many different local<br />\ngroups, ranging from high school<br />\norganizations to college clubs to<br />\nprivate teams. Each race lasts approximately 20-25 minutes, with<br />\nmultiple races throughout the<br />\nmorning and afternoon. After the<br />\nraces are finished, the teams<br />\nreturn to their sponsors and collect the money owed. All money<br />\ncollected by participants is then<br />\nsent to the Central Fuel Fund of<br />\nMaryland located in Towson, and<br />\nis then dispersed to various<br />\ngeographical areas. The amounts<br />\ndispersed to each area are determined by the same formulas used by MEAP, the Maryland<br />\nEnergy Assistance Program.<br />\nThe central theme behind Paddle for People, according to Janet<br />\n<br />\nCovington, a spokeswoman for<br />\nChannel 2 News, is to enlist the<br />\nprivate sector rather than the<br />\ngovernment to aid the poor in<br />\ntheir heating costs. As Ms. Covington explains, the Fuel Fund is<br />\na type of quasi-government agency, which means that all money<br />\n<br />\nEnlisting \"the private<br />\nsector rather than the<br />\ngovernment to aid the<br />\npoor.\"<br />\n<br />\ncollected is from private donors.<br />\nThe advantage to this type of aid<br />\nis that those who might not<br />\nqualify for much government aid<br />\nfor one reason or another can<br />\nreceive additional assistance, as<br />\nwell as, if a crisis arises, the<br />\nagency will be better equipped to<br />\nhandle the situation. According to<br />\n<br />\nMs. Covington, this year's program was extremely successful.<br />\nPreliminary figures show that the<br />\nFuel Fund raised approximately<br />\n$48,000 to $50,000 and all involved are quite pleased.<br />\nIn addition to the monetary<br />\naspect, Paddle for People utilizes<br />\nthe private sector in alternative<br />\nways, such as volunteer work.<br />\nThis work ranges from blowing<br />\nup balloons to registering teams<br />\nto counting balloon totals at the<br />\nend of each race. According to<br />\nLinda Faccett, PFP's coordinator<br />\nfor these volunteers, over one<br />\nhundred local organizations<br />\ndonated their time. As Ms. Faccett comments, \"volunteer<br />\ngroups are well-needed and are<br />\nvery welcomed.\" She adds that<br />\n\"they [PFP] ran short of groups<br />\nin the afternoon,\" but is appreciative for the help which they<br />\nreceived.

Known to the campus as<br />\nBeta, the group is composed of<br />\nsophomores,juniors, and seniors<br />\nwho are attempting to reactivate<br />\nthe Beta Theta Pi fraternity. As<br />\npart of their efforts to establish<br />\nthemselves, Beta volunteered<br />\ntheir assistance throughout the<br />\nday. According to Beta member<br />\nMike Baks, the volunteer work<br />\nwas \"a fun activity while helping<br />\nout the community.\" He adds<br />\nthat this type of work is nice since<br />\nit is \"not just giving, but it is getting involved\u2014that interaction\"<br />\nwith the people you are helping.<br />\nBeta began in the fall of this<br />\nsemester in answer to the campus' gradual move towards an increased involvement in the Greek<br />\nsystem. Presently, the campus is<br />\nabout 25 percent Greek. When<br />\nasked why begin a fraternity as<br />\nopposed to joining an existing<br />\none, Mr. Baks commented that<br />\n\"the student body is more diverse<br />\nthan a few years back\" and that<br />\n\"all interests are not represented<br />\nwithin the present Greek<br />\nsystem.\" When questioned as to<br />\nwhy Beta Theta Pi, Beta member<br />\nMark Rodeffer spoke of the<br />\nbrotherhood and the close relationships shared by not only the<br />\nmembers, but also the alumni. He<br />\nalso mentioned.that rather than<br />\nbring another new fraternity to<br />\ncampus, the students involved<br />\nwish to bring back one which<br />\nalready has a history.<br />\nThe history which Mr. Rodeffer refers to regards Beta as being the \"founding father\" of<br />\nHopkins' Greek system. As the<br />\nfirst fraternity at Hopkins, Beta<br />\nplayed an active role in sports and<br />\nsocial programs as well as<br />\nacademics. The chapter has been<br />\nabsent for more than twelve years<br />\nand the students are presently<br />\nworking with the administration<br />\nto bring the chapter back to the<br />\nHomewood campus. As one Beta<br />\nmember responds, \"Paddle for<br />\nPeople was the first of many<br />\nevents which. we hope to play an<br />\nactive role in at Hopkins as we attempt to return Beta to the position it once held\u2014a campus<br />\nleader.\" If all goes well, the<br />\nstudents would like to see Beta<br />\njoin the Greek system some time<br />\nin the spring.<br />\n<br />\nDIAL - A - DATE<br />\nThe Original, Still the Best!<br />\nJoin FREE, Call 24 Hours a Day<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\n, 486-2211<br />\nTO HEAR FEMALES<br />\nik<br />\n<br />\n976-7800<br />\nIN BALTO.

In<br />\nthe end it seems that U2's<br />\ndistinctly Irish/European sound<br />\nhas fallen as yet one more victim<br />\ncultural<br />\nof<br />\nAmerican<br />\nimperialism.<br />\nThe American approach has<br />\nalso had an affect on Bono's lyric<br />\nwriting. He has, perhaps naturally, become darker and more introspective over time, but he has<br />\nalso become much more direct<br />\nand overtly political, qualities that<br />\nI find alienating. Earlier U2 songs<br />\nwere much more ambiguous, and<br />\nthey concentrated on a montage<br />\nof images to convey their meaning. The interpretation of these<br />\nimages was left up to the listener,<br />\nwhich made each song much<br />\nmore of a personal experience.<br />\nBono, however, seems to have<br />\nlost confidence in both his earlier<br />\nlyrics' ability to convey his meaning and his listeners' ability to interpret them. Now he relies on<br />\n<br />\ndirect assertions and he is more<br />\nlikely to write a directly romantic or political song. Furthermore, these qualities seem to now<br />\nbe mutually exclusive, whereas<br />\nan earlier song like \"New Year's<br />\nDay\" could have multiple meanings and interpretations. Bono has<br />\nsimplified his lyric writing and<br />\nmade it more direct. In doing so<br />\nperhaps he has insured that the<br />\nmeaning of each song is clearer,<br />\nbut he has taken the listener out<br />\nof the loop and denied him the<br />\nability to make his own interpretations. Because of this, U2's<br />\nsongs may be less ambiguous, but<br />\nthey are also, to me at least, less<br />\npowerful.<br />\nClearly, U2 has changed quite<br />\na bit since 1980, when Boy was<br />\nreleased. Change is an inevitable<br />\nquality of life. I've changed since<br />\nfive years ago. The girl I sang to<br />\nhas been gone for two years, and<br />\nmany of my pre-Hopkins friends<br />\nhave gone on their own paths.

I'd buy them all the<br />\ntime, because it only took me a little less<br />\nthan an hour to do each one. That was<br />\nback in the olds days when things were<br />\nsimple.<br />\nSo now I sit here in the lounge at the<br />\nend of the hall on the third floor of the<br />\nhospital trying to sort out the pieces. I've<br />\nbeen used to the smell of cardboard<br />\ndust, but the odor of antiseptic is new<br />\nto me, and it makes me jittery. Sarah's<br />\nonly three rooms down the hall, but<br />\nshe's sleeping now and I don't think I<br />\nshould disturb her. She's been here for<br />\nthree weeks tomorrow, three weeks<br />\nsince she passed out on the kitchen<br />\nfloor while she was making dinner. She<br />\njust stopped and said, \"Oh Sid,\" then<br />\nfell. I thought that she was dead, and<br />\nI didn't know what to do, but somehow<br />\nthe ambulance got there and took us to<br />\nthe hospital.<br />\nI haven't been back to the house<br />\nsince then. I've been here, staying with<br />\nSarah and doing shy puzzles in the<br />\nmeantime.

That<br />\nyear for my birthday,, my wife Sarah<br />\nbought me this puzzle-doing book, and<br />\nalthough an old coot like myself doesn't<br />\nlike changing his ways, and I specifically<br />\ndid not read this book for weeks, I eventually got to it.

To look at her you<br />\nwouldn't know there's anything wrong,<br />\nexcept that bed she's in, it has those<br />\nmetal guards like all hospital beds. As<br />\nif she was going somewhere.<br />\nI run down to the little cafeteria in the<br />\nbasement and grab one of those yellow<br />\nstyrofoam trays with scrambled eggs<br />\nand microwaved bacon on it and a<br />\nstyrofoam cup of coffee. I pay $2.50 for<br />\nit, as if this whole ordeal isn't costing me<br />\nenough all ready. It smells like hospital<br />\nsheets, and it tastes like soap, but I<br />\nswallow fast. When I get back to the<br />\nroom, Sarah is already awake, looking<br />\nup at her morning news show on television. I don't think she has missed that<br />\nshow in the last ten years except for that<br />\nmorning after she fell.<br />\nI kiss her on the forehead and ask her<br />\nhow she is and she says fine, and I hold<br />\nher hand until she finishes watching her<br />\nprogram, pretending to watch the television with her but mostly just watching<br />\nher. When it's over we talk about<br />\nnothing in particular and she begs me<br />\nto tell her a story, she likes my stories<br />\nso much.

I've always liked<br />\npencils, because they never clog, you<br />\ncan write upside down on things with no<br />\nproblem, and you can erase what you<br />\nwrote if you don't want anyone else to<br />\nsee it.<br />\n\"I think you got a ways to go there,<br />\nMr. Sid,\" Sarah says when she sees<br />\nwhat I've done. \"You'd better let me<br />\nhelp you with that puzzle.\"<br />\nShe was never one much for puzzles,<br />\nbut we work on it together till lunch, then<br />\neven a little afterwards. We had the<br />\neasy, clear part in front of the picture to<br />\nwork on in front of us, and as soon as<br />\nshe got tired and frustrated with putting<br />\nthe little buggers together she helped<br />\nme by picking out all the clear pieces<br />\nshe could find for me to lay down.<br />\nSometimes we stayed quiet, as she tried<br />\nto pick out the pieces faster than I could<br />\nfit them in just so she could beam up at<br />\nme. I tried to work fast enough to make<br />\nit worth her smile. Most of the time we<br />\njust talked.<br />\nOne time we talked about the pencils,<br />\nwhat we could write with them. \"We<br />\ncould write love letters to each other, lots<br />\nof love letters.\" Sarah, she will always<br />\nbe Sarah. \"Or we could write our kids<br />\nabsent notes,\" I say, trying to play the<br />\ngrumpy, unromantic old codger, but<br />\nshe doesn't buy it for a minute.

I take away the puzzle, because I don't want them messing with our project. But I'm glad to see<br />\nthem all the same, and I know their<br />\ngrandmother is happy about the visit.<br />\nThey talk about school and work, and<br />\nI mostly watch them talk, mainly about<br />\nnothing, a different sort of nothing than<br />\nI talked I'm sure, though. The kids oohed and ahed about the hospital and<br />\nJimmy, who's been here once before,<br />\nthinks he knows all about everything.

They give<br />\nSarah get-well-soon cards and flowers,<br />\na couple magazines to the both of us,<br />\nand when five o'clock rolls around, the<br />\nkids have homework to do, so they promise to be back in a day or two.<br />\nThen the puzzle gets all fuzzy, and<br />\nSarah can't help me anymore. Up by<br />\nthe fuzzy part, see, it gets harder and<br />\nharder to tell the pieces apart and figure<br />\nout what goes where. I'm not even sure<br />\nI know. I can stare at it for as long as<br />\nI want, and it just never seems to make<br />\nsense to me.<br />\nWhen the kids come to see their<br />\ngrandma just two days later, and it takes<br />\nher awhile before she recognizes them<br />\nand remembers who they are, her own<br />\ngrandkids, then they know something's<br />\nreally wrong. I say no, she's just tired,<br />\ncome back tomorrow. The kids are<br />\nscared, and I know they won't come<br />\nback to see the old lady except maybe<br />\nonce more, when their mother and<br />\n<br />\n'Rotunda<br />\nWiRe<br />\n<br />\nmaybe be the first thing she sees when<br />\nshe wakes up.

Around noon some nurses come<br />\nin, take some readings and<br />\nmeasurements and do some things,<br />\nthen a pair of doctors appear, more<br />\nreadings. They don't see me there,<br />\nmuch like Sarah doesn't see me. She's<br />\nin a coma, a doctor tells the nurses. One<br />\nof the nurses turns to me, puts her hand<br />\non my shoulder. I am tired again, and<br />\nI want to go back to sleep.<br />\nIt had to happen sooner or later. Just<br />\nas the sharp, colorful pencils blended<br />\ntogether farther back in the picture, the<br />\nfocus keeps getting fuzzier until nothing<br />\nis left but black. Now all I have left to do<br />\non my puzzle is the black part.<br />\nThe black part at the top takes the<br />\nlongest time\u2014it's so hard to tell one<br />\npiece from another. I've been working<br />\non it for the past few days now, nothing<br />\nbut black. I'm sure either tomorrow, or<br />\nmaybe the next day I'll finish up those<br />\nblack pieces, and then the puzzle will<br />\nbe done. And then I can start a new<br />\none, even bigger and better, with more<br />\ncolors, and more pieces, although I<br />\ndon't think I want another with quite so<br />\nmuch black. Any minute now, all of the<br />\nholes of the puzzle will be filled up.<br />\nAnd over the loudspeaker I am startled to hear, \"Dr. Black, report to room<br />\n303, Dr. Black . . .\" I remember now,<br />\njust like they use Dr. Red as a code for<br />\na heart attack over the hospital speakers<br />\nso as not to alarm any of the patients,<br />\nthey use Dr. Black to mean that there<br />\nhas been a death.<br />\nWhen I am up again, I feel sick in my<br />\nIt strikes me, and I get up quickly, runstomach.

All I want to do Schochet.<br />\nis look at her, just,sit and watch her, and<br />\n<br />\nfather say they have to. But it's better<br />\nthat way\u2014if Sarah sees that they're<br />\nupset, then she might become upset,<br />\neverybody will be upset, and I don't<br />\nthink we need any more upsetting than<br />\nnecessary.<br />\nBut I work on the puzzle myself, and<br />\nI talk to her while I'm doing it. She<br />\ndoesn't remember about the absent<br />\nnotes she was going to write, or about<br />\nthe love notes anymore, but I talk to her<br />\nanyway, I just want to talk to her, and<br />\nbesides, I think it does her good. She<br />\nstill knows me, I'm sure, and\u2014what's<br />\nthat? A little league game? The one<br />\nMichael played last week on the old field<br />\ndown the road?

I just want to talk to<br />\nher.<br />\nFuzzier and fuzzier, and Sarah has<br />\nheadaches and she wants to sleep a little more now, and she wakes up and<br />\nhas her hand to her head, and I say<br />\n\"Sarah, you all right, honey?\" but she<br />\njust looks at me and rubs her forehead,<br />\nand then she wants to go back to sleep.<br />\nI hug her and kiss the back of her hand,<br />\nand I tell her I love her, and she says<br />\nI love you too\u2014pause\u2014Sid.

They<br />\nseemed convinced that, despite<br />\ntheir 0-5 record, they had a good<br />\nfootball team and that victory<br />\nwould come shortly. But there<br />\ncomes a time when optimism<br />\nmust disappear and be replaced<br />\nby the sad truth of a dismal<br />\nseason. That time came last week<br />\nfor the Blue Jays, as they blew a<br />\n13-7 halftime lead and lost 26-13<br />\nto Muhlenberg.<br />\nHopkins is now 0-6 with an 0-4<br />\nrecord in the Centennial Conference, and things will not get<br />\nany easier. This Saturday, tht<br />\nJays face a tough Georgetown<br />\nteam in Washington before returning home to face nationallyranked and undefeated Dickinson<br />\non October 29. After playing the<br />\nRed Raiders, Hopkins travels to<br />\nFranklin & Marshall to face one<br />\n<br />\nof the Centennial Conference's<br />\nperennial powers. Indeed, it<br />\nseems the only chance the Blue<br />\nJays have to salvage a victory,<br />\nbarring a major upset, will be in<br />\nthe season finale against Western<br />\nMaryland. But with an offense<br />\nthat is averaging less than 10<br />\npoints per game and a nagging<br />\nquarterback problem, Hopkins<br />\nmay be staring a winless season<br />\nright in the face.<br />\nThe first quarter of last Saturday's game against Muhlenberg<br />\nwas reminiscent of the Blue Jays'<br />\nseason thus far. The offense was<br />\nhampered by costly turnovers,<br />\nand the defense bailed them out.<br />\nWith eight minutes gone in the<br />\n;ame, Gary Rupert was inercepted by Mules' safety Mike<br />\nBaraldi, who returned the ball to<br />\nthe Hopkins 18 yard line. The<br />\nBlue Jay offense held them there,<br />\nhowever, and Muhlenberg was<br />\nforced to settle for a 31-yard field<br />\ngoal by Rob Powers. Eric<br />\nTrenaman, who replaced Rupert<br />\nlate in the first quarter, later<br />\n<br />\nthrew an interception to<br />\nMuhlenberg's cornerback John<br />\nRishko. Once again the Hopkins<br />\ndefense refused to yiel0 a<br />\ntouchdown, as another Powers<br />\nfield goal put the Mules on top<br />\n6-0.<br />\nAt the end of the first half, the<br />\nBlue Jays looked like they might<br />\nget their first win of the season.<br />\nWith two minutes to play,<br />\nTrenaman led Hopkins on a nine<br />\nplay, 67 yard scoring drive to tie<br />\nthe score at 6-6. The touchdown<br />\ncame on a beautiful fourth down<br />\nscoring strike to Chris Reichart.<br />\nThe Mules quickly struck back,<br />\nmoving the ball to midfield with<br />\na hurry-up offense.

The victories over<br />\nCarnegie and Rochester established Hopkins as the 1988 University Athletic Association (UAA)<br />\nFestival<br />\nField<br />\nHockey<br />\nChampions.<br />\nThe Lady Jays beat Haverford<br />\nlast Thursday, October 13, in<br />\ntheir last home regular game of<br />\nthe season. Patti Ordonez tallied<br />\nHopkins' first goal on a pass from<br />\n\u2022Kathy Hart less than five minutes<br />\ninto the game. Kathy Kerring put<br />\nanother one past the Red Devil<br />\ngoalkeeper five minutes later on<br />\nanother pass from Hart. Five<br />\nminutes after that, Ordonez<br />\ngrabbed a rebound off the goalie<br />\npads to score the eventual gamewinning goal and put the Jays up<br />\n3-0. Jennifer Chun scored<br />\nHopkins' fourth and final goal in<br />\nthe beginning of the second half<br />\nas Hart earned her third assist of<br />\nthe game. Haverford staged a<br />\nlate-game rally, but they fell short<br />\nand lost 4-2.<br />\nThe Lady Jays played their first<br />\nUAA tournament game against<br />\nCarnegie Mellon on Saturday,<br />\nOctober 15, easily besting them<br />\n5-0. Jackie Fatula scored first for<br />\nHopkins on a penalty stroke,<br />\nwhile strong shots produced goals<br />\nfrom Ordonez, Hart, and two<br />\nfrom Julie Siegrist. Fatula and<br />\nRachel McGuckian each also had<br />\nan assist.<br />\nAccording to Coach Sally Beth<br />\nAnderson, \"We knew that we<br />\nweren't going to have much trouble with Carnegie Mellon, so to<br />\nget ready for Rochester, we concentrated on stick-to-stick passes<br />\nand other fine points of the game<br />\ninstead of just bombing the ball<br />\nup the field. We had some<br />\nbeautiful plays, and I'm really<br />\npleased with the teamwork.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe strategy must have worked, because the next day the Lady<br />\nJays exhibited their skill and<br />\nteamwork to beat Rochester in<br />\ndouble overtime, 4-3. Hopkins<br />\nscored first on penalty corner<br />\nplay #2, in which McGuckian hit<br />\nthe ball out from the endline to<br />\nHart, who then passed the ball to<br />\nFatula, who slammed it in for the<br />\nscore. Rochester then tied the<br />\ngame, but the Jays scored again<br />\nwhen McGuckian drove the ball<br />\nacross the goal and Ordonez<br />\nswept it in to put Hopkins ahead<br />\n2-1 at halftime.<br />\nRochester came back in the second half and was winning 3-2,<br />\nwhen the McGuckian-Hart-Fatula<br />\npenalty corner play #2 struck<br />\nagain, tying the score at 3-3 and<br />\nsending the game into overtime.<br />\nHopkins finally scored the gamewinning goal halfway into the second ten-minute overtime, when<br />\nFatula tallied on a pass from<br />\nHart. The Fatula-Hart combination produced three goals, a<br />\nperfect hat trick.<br />\nCoach Anderson said after the<br />\ngame, \"I think we really played<br />\nwell, coming from behind to win<br />\nin double overtime. The lead kept<br />\nswitching; it was a great game for<br />\nthe spectators to watch. As I said<br />\nbefore, we find a way to win.\"<br />\nThe Jays then beat their<br />\nBaltimore rivals, the Goucher<br />\nGophers, on Wednesday, October 19. Hopkins' three goals<br />\nwere scored by Fatula, Hart, and<br />\nMeredith Blitz, her first of the<br />\nseason. Herring had the single<br />\nassist.<br />\nThe 3-1<br />\nvictory<br />\nwas<br />\ncharacterized by some rough<br />\nplaying on Goucher's part, as<br />\nthey haven't beaten Hopkins in<br />\nthree years and weren't very happy about it. The Jays played a little sloppily at times, looking like<br />\na completely different team than<br />\nthey did against Rochester.<br />\n\"Still,\" said Anderson, \"it was<br />\ngreat to have a warm-up on grass<br />\nfor the MAC tournament. The<br />\ntransition to grass is always tough<br />\n<br />\nafter playing three games on<br />\nastroturf.\"<br />\nThe regular season ended with<br />\na three-way tie between Hopkins,<br />\nGettysburg, and Juniata for first<br />\nplace in the MAC Southwest Section. Since only two teams per<br />\nsection participate in the MAC<br />\nplayoffs, the three teams are<br />\nholding a mini-playoff for the<br />\nMAC playoffs. Hopkins randomly drew the bye, and will play<br />\nGettysburg, who beat Juniata on<br />\nWednesday in the first game of<br />\nthe mini-playoff, for the<br />\nSouthwest Section title on Friday,<br />\nOctober 21.<br />\nIf Hopkins beats Gettysburg,<br />\nthen the Jays will host Messiah at<br />\nhome on Monday, October 24, at<br />\n3:00 p.m., for the first round of<br />\nthe playoffs.

Last year,<br />\nHopkins lost in the first round to<br />\nDrew University 3-2, in a hard<br />\nfought double overtime away<br />\ngame.<br />\nEven with the four wins and a<br />\nberth in the MAC tournament,<br />\nHopkins still dropped to fourth in<br />\nthe NCAA Division III South<br />\nRegion ranking, with Lynchburg<br />\nCollege moving into third. Lynchburg moved up because they<br />\nhave a comparable number of<br />\nwins but only lost to Salisbury 3-1<br />\nwhile Hopkins lost 3-0. The Lady<br />\nJays will now have to get past the<br />\nfirst round of the MAC tournament to have a chance at an<br />\nNCAA tournament bid.<br />\nRegardless of the outcome of<br />\nthe MAC and NCAA tournaments, Coach Anderson and<br />\nher Jays still have a very successful regular season. They were<br />\n6-1 against MAC opponents and<br />\n12-2 overall. \"We won the UAA<br />\ntournament and got into the MAC<br />\ntournament,\" Anderson said.<br />\n\"We have lots to be proud of.\"<br />\n<br />\nAMR II<br />\nSNACK BAR<br />\n<br />\nPIZZA<br />\nDIAL EXTENSION 7972<br />\n<br />\nFREE DELIVERY<br />\nTO EVERY CORNER OF HOMEWOOD CAMPUS<br />\nNoon- 3:00 p.m. / 5:00 - Midnight<br />\n<br />\n\u00b0Llltm PIZZA<br />\nAre you considering professional school?<br />\n<br />\nHARVARD UNIVERSITY<br />\nJOHN F.

One<br />\nwas Dickinson College, who won<br />\n1-0 on a goal late in the first half,<br />\nand the other was the referees.<br />\nThe referees made many questionable calls leading to the ejection of one Hopkins player.<br />\nThe game began easily enough,<br />\nas the Blue Jays got many scoring opportunities early in the<br />\ngame. Warren Jones had a oneon-one with the goalie early in the<br />\ngame but couldn't finish it off.<br />\n<br />\nJim McKiernan followed with a<br />\nshot that narrowly missed the<br />\ngoal.<br />\nThe Hooters kept the pressure<br />\non the Red Raiders, but they<br />\ncouldn't put the ball into the net.<br />\nThe referees didn't help matters<br />\nmuch, as they stopped Blue Jay<br />\nattacks with untimely calls<br />\nthroughout the second half. For<br />\nthe first time all season, the team<br />\nlost control as fatigue and frustration set in. Five Hopkins players<br />\nreceived yellow cards, and one<br />\nreceived a red card.<br />\nHopkins rebounded the following Wednesday, as they defeated<br />\nWestern Maryland 2-0 under extremely windy conditions. Jim<br />\nMcKiernan stole the show as he<br />\nnetted both goals for the Hooters.<br />\nMcKiernan was all over the field,<br />\nwinning tackles and head balls<br />\n<br />\nGraduate Study<br />\nin Engineering<br />\nDARTMOUTH<br />\nCOLLEGE<br />\nStudents with backgrounds in<br />\nEngineering, Mathematics, Computer Science or the Physical<br />\nSciences are invited to apply for<br />\nMasters and Doctoral programs.<br />\nFellowships covering full tuition<br />\nand monthly stipend are<br />\navailable.<br />\nA faculty member will be on<br />\ncampus October 27, 1988 from<br />\n10:00-4:00 p.m. Contact the Office of Career Counseling and<br />\nPlacement for further information and appointment.<br />\n<br />\nwhile creating holes in the Green<br />\nTerrors' defense with some sharp<br />\npassing.<br />\nOverall, the Hooters dominated<br />\nthe game on the ground. Balls in<br />\nthe air were tough to handle as the<br />\nsevere wind played havoc with the<br />\nball. TheNo-GoalPatrol played very<br />\nwell despite the absence of senior<br />\nco-captain Matt Lawrence, who<br />\nwas sidelined due to illness. Jerry<br />\nIrvine recorded his fourth and the<br />\nteam's sixth shutout of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nLast Saturday, the Hooters<br />\nraised their record to 6-4-1<br />\noverall and 1-1-1 in the conference with a victory over Swarthmore here on the turf at<br />\nHomewood. Hopkins played<br />\nsome of their best defense of the<br />\nseason in the 2-1 win over the Little Quakers, who were the best<br />\n<br />\nteam the Blue Jays have faced all<br />\nseason. Swarthmore was limited<br />\nto five shots on net and got their<br />\ngoal on a fluke mistake by goalie<br />\nJerry Irvine.<br />\nDown 1-0 at halftime, the<br />\nHooters came from behind, inspired by the fact that if they lost<br />\nthis game, they would be<br />\neliminated from the MAC<br />\nplayoffs. Craig Weinstein scored<br />\nthe team's first goal off a deflection of a Dan Sisbarro shot. Grenville Jones got the game-winning<br />\ngoal off an assist from Andy<br />\nNicholas. Jones took the pass<br />\nabout 40 yards from the goal, faking outside and then beating the<br />\ndefender to the inside. Jones, who<br />\nleads Hopkins in scoring, then<br />\nfired a bullet into the back of the<br />\nnet while his man was left on the<br />\nground behind him. The game<br />\n<br />\nwas marred by an injury to<br />\nsweeper Matt Lawrence, who<br />\nseparated his shoulder and whose<br />\nstatus is currently day by day.<br />\nThe Hooters will play two extremely important road games<br />\nthis week. Tomorrow morning<br />\nthey will face Franklin & Marshall in Pennsylvania. On Tuesday they will play a South East<br />\nDivision foe, as they face<br />\nWidener. Victory at Widener<br />\ncould give the Blue Jays a<br />\nlegitimate shot at an MAC playoff<br />\nbid.

Jays but fate would play a cruel<br />\n<br />\ntrick on these runners. Cool, nippy weather and stiffer competition combined to leave the Jays<br />\nwith no better than a sixth place<br />\nfinish, but there were several<br />\nbright spots amidst the setback.<br />\nOnce again, Robinson ran well<br />\nand finished fifth overall with a time<br />\nof 26:18. Senior Co-Captain Dan<br />\nDairaghi had his best race of the<br />\nyear, thus far, finishing second on<br />\nthe team and twenty-eighth<br />\noverall.<br />\nUndaunted by their insignifi-<br />\n<br />\ncant lapse at Dickinson, the Jays<br />\nunleashed their revenge upon the<br />\nunsuspecting Green Terrors of<br />\nWestern Maryland. The Jays<br />\nwreaked havoc, finishing four<br />\nrunners in the top five overall and<br />\ncombining for a team score of 22.<br />\nEveryone ran well at Western<br />\nMaryland, but of special<br />\nsignificance was the team third<br />\nplace finish of Co-Captain Scott<br />\nBaker and strong showing by the<br />\nfifth through seventh runners,<br />\nnamely Hostin, Craig Freeman<br />\n<br />\nVolleyball improves despite 8-14 record<br />\nby Rachel McGuckian<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins women's<br />\nvolleyball team wrapped up its<br />\n1988 season last Friday, October<br />\n14, with a victory over Swarthmore and a loss to Haverford at<br />\nhome. The Lady Jays finished<br />\n8-14 overall, equalling last year's<br />\nwin total, but failing to achieve<br />\ntheir goal of a .500 season.<br />\nDespite the indications of their<br />\nfinal record, the volleyball team<br />\ndisplayed a great deal of talent<br />\nand depth of play.

Even<br />\nthough the competition will be<br />\ntough (five of the UAA teams<br />\nwent on to Div III Nationals last<br />\nyear), the Jays remain loose and<br />\nfearless in regards to the task that<br />\nlays before them.<br />\nThe women's cross country<br />\nteam had its second consecutive<br />\nwinning weekend last Saturday<br />\nby defeating Elizabethtown,<br />\nGallaudet, and Western Maryland<br />\nin Westminister.

First, said Thurow, in<br />\n1980, the U.S. had a $30 billion<br />\nfarm subsidies surplus. As other<br />\nnations' farm production has<br />\nswelled, however, the US.<br />\nbecame forced to sell $30 billion<br />\nworth of manufacturing exports<br />\nto meet its balance of payments.<br />\nIn addition, as a result of the<br />\nLatin American debt crisis,, the<br />\nU.S. lost what were its biggest<br />\ncustomers in 1980.<br />\nFurther, because of the decline<br />\nin the price of oil, the U.S. shut<br />\ndown many comparatively highcost wells and imports more oil.<br />\nCheaper industrial labor costs<br />\nelsewhere have also moved many<br />\nU.S.jobs overseas, said Thurow.<br />\nThus, the U.S. lost its status as<br />\nthe world's premier economic<br />\npower, and shares center stage<br />\nwith Japan and Western Europe.<br />\nGone are the days when the U.S.<br />\nwas twice as wealthy as the<br />\nworld's second wealthiest power,<br />\nand eight times as wealthy as<br />\nJapan, in 1950.<br />\nAfter World War II, the U.S.<br />\nheld such a technological<br />\nsuperiority over Europe and<br />\nJapan that the advertising slogan<br />\nof the Boeing plane versus the<br />\nBritish Comet was \"our plane<br />\nflies, theirs doesn't,\" said<br />\nThurow. The U.S. had a better<br />\neducated and skilled work force<br />\nthan any other nation, he said.<br />\nNo longer is this the case.<br />\nAustria, Denmark, Japan, the<br />\nNetherlands, Norway, Swede,<br />\nSwitzerland, and West Germany<br />\nsurpass the U.S. in per capita income. Since they have higher individual and corporate savings<br />\nrates, they can afford to reinvest<br />\nin their industry in the form of<br />\nnew machine tools in ways that<br />\nAmerican firms cannot.<br />\nThe U.S. is creating a country<br />\nof functionally technological illiterates, said Thurow.

Consequently, this additionally cost is<br />\nnot factored into the cost of their<br />\nproduct, said Thurow.<br />\nIn addition, West Germany and<br />\nJapan graduate forty percent of<br />\ntheir college undergraduates with<br />\nscience and engineering degrees.<br />\nOnly sixteen percent of all<br />\nAmerican college undergraduates<br />\nmajor in science and engineering.<br />\nThurow said these data explain<br />\nwhy German and Japanese products seem to work better and are<br />\ngenerally more dependable.<br />\nAccording to Thurow one of<br />\nthe main reasons the U.S. is going into debt is that it will not<br />\nadapt culturally to meet the growing changes in the world<br />\neconomic picture.

On<br />\nthe one hand there is the importance of providing quality<br />\nHomewood<br />\nfor<br />\nteaching<br />\nundergraduates and the obvious<br />\nnecessity of English competence<br />\nfor teachers. On the other is the<br />\nUniversity's ability to attract<br />\nquality graduate students and the<br />\nhandicap that a spoken-English<br />\ncompetence requirement would<br />\npresent. Because Johns Hopkins<br />\nis an institution geared primarily<br />\ntowards research, it is the latter<br />\nof these two conflicting interests<br />\nwhich prevails. I contend that the<br />\nUniversity can and should take a<br />\nbold step in this area and develop<br />\n-a mutually satisfactory solution to<br />\nthis problem. Let me explain.<br />\nHopkins has a reputation for<br />\nexcellence in research and<br /><br />\ngraduate training beyond<br />\nreproach. Since the University's<br />\nfounding, these areas have always<br />\nreceived the greatest emphasis. I<br />\nbelieve, however, that because of<br />\nits outstanding reputation, Johns<br />\nHopkins can move to require not<br />\nonly higher scores on both the<br />\nwritten and spoken TOEFL exams(the latter of which should be<br />\nimplemented as a prerequisite for<br />\nadmission) but also the participation of all graduate students with<br />\nan unsatisfactory English proficiency in an on-going intensive<br />\nprogram to make them communicative as quickly as possible,<br />\ncertainly by their graduation.<br />\nOn the surface, this may seem<br />\nlike a great deal to ask not only<br />\nof the University, but also of the<br />\ndepartments, which depend on<br />\nquality graduate students to bring<br />\nthem research funds. And certainly, at first, it might impede<br />\nstudent recruitment. But simply<br /><br />\nbecause our peer institutions<br />\nchoose to continue to apply superficial solutions to the problem of<br />\nEnglish proficiency among teaching assistants, does not mean<br />\nthat Johns Hopkins must follow<br />\nsuit in the effort to compete.<br />\nThere is a dear need for leadership in this area, and if Hopkins<br />\nshows a willingness to provide<br />\nthat leadership, the reputation of<br />\nthe University will be enhanced.<br />\nThere are numerous reasons<br />\nwhy the University should take<br />\nthis strong stance, and do so<br />\nquickly. First, the cutback in<br />\nfaculty size to its 1982 level,<br />\nnecessitated by the A&amp;S budget<br />\ndeficit, means that graduate<br />\nteaching assistants will have more<br />\nclassroom<br />\ncontact<br />\nwith<br />\nundergraduates, thus potentially<br />\nexacerbating an already poor<br />\nsituation.<br />\nSecond,<br />\nthe<br />\nSee DECAGNA, 8<br /><br />\nWhen the going gets tough, the<br />\ntough call home and try to find<br />\nsomeone to listen to them.

I can however provide the<br />\nanswer to Mr. Marino's question<br />\n(News-Letter, October 4th) as to<br />\nthe difference between South<br />\nAfrica and various other countries which he mentions. The difference is that South Africa is the<br />\nonly country in the world where<br />\na small ethnic minority<br />\nsystematically and with great<br />\nbrutality represses the majority of<br />\nthe population for no other reason<br />\nthan the colour of their skin.<br />\nMoreover, if Mr. Marino wishes<br />\nto expose the deplorable conditions in coutries like Angola and<br />\nMozambique he should be aware<br />\nof the contribution that the<br />\nUNITA and RENAMO terrorist<br />\nmovements make to these conditions. And does he know which<br />\ngovernment is responsible for<br />\nsupporting them...?<br />\nChris Smaje<br /><br />\nA critical tool<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nSomething of a political discussion awakens in the pages of the<br />\nNews-Letter! I found Jim<br />\nMarino's response to Patrick<br />\nBond to be partially insightful,<br />\nbut lacking a significant, struc-<br /><br />\npseudo: phoning home<br />\ntured approach to political<br />\neconomy. Yes, most governments are hierarchical and oppressive; not even frosh need to<br />\nread the News-Letter to know<br />\nthat. But why any specific<br />\ngovernment, in its geopolitical<br />\ncontext, abuses its mandate\u2014here<br />\nwe have the heart of the political<br />\ninquiry. Mr. Marino failed to address this central problem; instead he asked Mr. Bond to recant<br />\npart of a cohesive analysis. Why<br />\nless discussion, and not more?<br />\nI think that the Marxism which<br />\nMr. Marino is afraid to inveStigate (albeit \"Marxism\"<br />\nwhich Pol Pot et al misquote and<br />\ndistort horrifically) and the Marxism which Mr. Bond, myself, and<br />\nothers apply to world history is<br />\na critical tool in resolving the<br />\nshameful inequalities in our<br />\nsociety.<br />\nDaniel Plattner<br /><br />\nPSEUDO, from 6<br />\nnext to the garage, all that smoke.<br />\nI think he misses Mom.

But on Wednesday, October 12, at the Wednesday Noon<br />\nseries, Dr. Elaine Eff presented<br />\nher new film she directed and<br />\nproduced, The Screen Painters,<br />\nand held a question and answer<br />\nperiod afterwards.<br />\nThe painted screen is similar to<br />\nthe decorated screens sometimes<br />\nseen on the back windows of<br />\nvans, only they are generally<br />\nfound on rowhouse windows and<br />\nscreen doors. The hand-painted<br />\nscenes are generally more<br />\nelaborate than what one would<br />\nfind on the back of a van, and not<br />\nonly do they offer privacy to people whose windows are close to<br />\nthe street, but they greatly<br />\nenhance the appearance of the<br />\nneighbourhood.<br />\nThe most important distinction<br />\nof the painted screen, however,<br />\ndoes not lie in its appearance. According to Dr. Eff, \"Nowhere<br />\nelse in the universe can we find<br />\nthe painted screen as a contemBill Berger porary art form.\"<br />\nThis is the door and the brand new blue canopy of the Grad Club. But<br />\nAlthough many different subdon't take our word that it's blue\u2014go see for yourself.<br />\njects have been painted on<br /><br />\nscreens, most of them deal with<br />\nnature. Seagulls, ships, ducks in<br />\nponds, and red-roofed bungalows<br />\nin the country are all common<br />\nscenes, although each artist has<br />\nhis own style for each, and none<br />\nwould consider copying that of<br />\nany other. Some of the less common sights include a painting of<br />\nElvis singing \"Love Me Tender\"<br />\nand an outer space scene.<br />\nOne artist's personal favorite is<br />\nof a clipper ship, with a red hull<br />\nand full, billowing sail, bursting<br />\nthrough blue-green water<br />\nunderneath a stormy sky.<br />\nThe art was started in 1913<br />\nwhen William Octavek, a Bohemian, painted pictures of produce<br />\non his grocery store's screen<br />\ndoor. For the rest of his life, he<br />\nfound himself painting screens<br />\nand teaching others the craft.<br />\nLike other folk traditions, he<br />\npassed the art onto his sons when<br />\nhe passed away.<br />\nToday, the cost of having a<br />\nscreen painted can range<br />\nanywhere from $15 to $100. The<br />\nvariables include factors like the<br />\nsize of the screen, what kind of<br />\nscene is to be painted, and \"what<br />\nkind of car you drove when you<br />\ncame to their house.\"<br />\n_<br />\n_<br />\nIn addition to interviews with<br />\nthe last of the professional street<br />\npainters and owners, a number of<br />\nlocal celebrities appeared in.the<br />\nfilm.<br /><br />\n\"We did dozens of celebrity interviews. We talked to people<br />\nwho have national profiles, people who are known for their local<br />\ncolor, like Ethel Ennis and Mimi<br />\nDiPietro.\"<br />\n\"If you walk along in a nice<br />\nneighborhood and it's clean and<br />\nyou see the screens,\" says<br />\nGovernor William Donald Schaefer,<br />\nsay, \"what a nice neighborhood.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nUnfortunately, not all of the<br />\nfootage could be included in the<br />\nhalf hour film. According to Dr.<br />\nEff, many of the interviews just<br />\ndid not work. Ultimately,<br />\nhowever, she contends that this<br />\nwas the best way to go about the<br />\nfilm.<br />\n\"That's what's the best part<br />\nabout this film. It is a documentary, so it's unscripted,\" she<br />\nsays. \"We hope that the<br />\ndocumentary keeps people<br />\ninterested.\"<br />\nInterest is important to the art<br />\nof screen painting, as there are<br />\nonly six professional painters left.<br />\n\"We want to feel that we not<br />\nonly captured the vitality of the<br />\nscreen painting, but we want to<br />\nhelp in its revival,\" says Dr. Eff.<br />\n\"What we're looking at is a dying art.\"<br />\nThe painters do not seem to<br />\nagree, however as one of them<br />\nSee SCREENS, 11<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/11<br /><br />\nWednesday Noon Series shows screen paintings<br />\nSCREENS, from 10<br />\nnoted that \"they call it a dying<br />\nart, but it's not a dying art. Just<br />\nthe people who are painting the<br />\nscreens are dying.\"<br />\nAccording to Dr. Eff, the<br />\nreason why the film got off the<br />\nground was because two of the<br />\nproperties she wanted to document were sold, and one of the<br />\nscreen painters, Ted Richardson,<br />\nbecame critically ill with cancer.<br />\nHe died six weeks after the<br />\nfilming.<br />\n\"I knew this should have been<br />\na film. The right people and the<br />\nright times came together,\" she<br />\nsays. \"This is my way of thanking the screen painters and the<br />\npeople of Baltimore and giving<br />\nsomething back to the city.\"<br />\nAlthough not a native<br />\nBaltimorean, Dr. Eff has lived in<br />\nthe city since she was seven years<br />\nold. Her doctoral thesis at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania is on<br />\nthe folk art aspect of the painted<br />\nscreens of Baltimore. Her interest<br />\nin the art brought her back to<br />\nBaltimore and aided the creation<br />\nof her present job, the City of<br />\nBaltimore Folklorist.<br />\n\"I created this job because<br />\nthere's the constant tension bet- \u2022<br /><br />\nween tradition and progress,<br />\ncausing people to accentuate<br />\ntradition,\" states Dr. Eff. \"Some<br />\npeople say that all we do is glorify<br />\nthe mundane. But what are we<br />\nhere for in the city government?<br />\nNot just to badger people to pay<br />\ntheir bills, but also to reward.\"<br />\nIndeed, she is the first holder<br />\nof the position, instituted three<br />\nand a half years ago to document,<br />\npreserve, and promote local traditions. According to Dr. Eff, this<br />\noffice is the first of its kind in the<br />\ncountry.<br />\n\"The best part of this job is<br />\nmaking people feel good about<br />\nwhat might seem like a simple<br />\ncontribution to a complex<br />\nworld,\" says Dr. Eff. \"The<br />\nreason why Baltimore interests<br />\nme is that it is such a conservative<br />\ntown, that it holds on to its<br />\ntraditions.\"<br />\nThe film was cosponsored by<br />\nThe Painted Screen Society of<br />\nBaltimore, Inc., and Baltimore<br />\nTraditions; two nonprofit, public<br />\norganizations. Although it was<br />\nproduced independently of her<br />\ngovernment positions, it fits well<br />\nwith the job.<br />\n\"This is the perfect example of<br />\nwhat we do and how we do it,\"<br />\nshe says. \"My office exists to<br /><br />\nSpecial Offer for<br />\nHopkins Affiliates<br /><br />\nmake sure what is special to the<br />\ncity doesn't get lost.\"<br />\nThe actual office of which her<br />\nposition is a part is called Baltimore<br />\nTraditions, and it is part of the<br />\nDepartment of Housing and<br />\nCommunity Development.<br />\n\"I am the only full-time<br />\nemployee,\" says Dr. Eff. \"People work with us as contract or<br />\npart-time employees based on<br />\ncurrent projects.\"<br />\nAccording to Dr. Eff, much of<br />\nthe community work she did in<br />\nPennsylvania involved a number<br />\nof college students.<br />\n\"At the University of Pennsylvania, the folklore project has<br />\ncertainly enhanced the students'<br />\nknowledge of Philadelphia. I wish<br />\nwe had more students willing to<br />\ndo field work here.\"<br />\nPainted screens are not Dr.<br />\nEffs only passion. Some of her<br />\nfavorite sights in Baltimore are:<br />\nthe Boxer's Hall of Fame and<br />\nPool Room in Canton, the St.<br />\nMichael's Ukranian Catholic<br />\nchurch, where on Thursday and<br />\nFridays women gather to make<br />\nperogees and hardly anyone there<br />\nspeaks English, the St. Anthony's<br />\nFestival, which is a street<br />\ntion in Little Italy in honor of the<br />\nneighborhood being spared by<br /><br />\nEric Deutsch<br /><br />\nDr. Elaine Eff, City of Baltimore Folklorist, stands in front of a poster<br />\npublicizing her new film, The Screen Painters.<br /><br />\nthe Great Baltimore Fire, and the<br />\nmany markets, the most impressive of which is Lexington<br />\nMarket.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Eff, in order<br />\nto find the painted screens, which<br />\nwill be taken down for winter<br />\n'soon, try walking along North<br />\nCollington Avenue between the<br />\n800 and 900 blocks.

The program involves multiple races<br />\nwhich take place in the city's In-<br /><br />\nner Harbor. Thousands of<br />\nballoons are let loose in a<br />\ndesignated area of the harbor and<br />\nteams race in paddle boats to collect as many balloons as possible.<br />\nEach team is composed of 2 people from many different local<br />\ngroups, ranging from high school<br />\norganizations to college clubs to<br />\nprivate teams. Each race lasts approximately 20-25 minutes, with<br />\nmultiple races throughout the<br />\nmorning and afternoon. After the<br />\nraces are finished, the teams<br />\nreturn to their sponsors and collect the money owed. All money<br />\ncollected by participants is then<br />\nsent to the Central Fuel Fund of<br />\nMaryland located in Towson, and<br />\nis then dispersed to various<br />\ngeographical areas. The amounts<br />\ndispersed to each area are determined by the same formulas used by MEAP, the Maryland<br />\nEnergy Assistance Program.<br />\nThe central theme behind Paddle for People, according to Janet<br /><br />\nCovington, a spokeswoman for<br />\nChannel 2 News, is to enlist the<br />\nprivate sector rather than the<br />\ngovernment to aid the poor in<br />\ntheir heating costs. As Ms. Covington explains, the Fuel Fund is<br />\na type of quasi-government agency, which means that all money<br /><br />\nEnlisting \"the private<br />\nsector rather than the<br />\ngovernment to aid the<br />\npoor.\"<br /><br />\ncollected is from private donors.<br />\nThe advantage to this type of aid<br />\nis that those who might not<br />\nqualify for much government aid<br />\nfor one reason or another can<br />\nreceive additional assistance, as<br />\nwell as, if a crisis arises, the<br />\nagency will be better equipped to<br />\nhandle the situation. According to<br /><br />\nMs. Covington, this year's program was extremely successful.<br />\nPreliminary figures show that the<br />\nFuel Fund raised approximately<br />\n$48,000 to $50,000 and all involved are quite pleased.<br />\nIn addition to the monetary<br />\naspect, Paddle for People utilizes<br />\nthe private sector in alternative<br />\nways, such as volunteer work.<br />\nThis work ranges from blowing<br />\nup balloons to registering teams<br />\nto counting balloon totals at the<br />\nend of each race. According to<br />\nLinda Faccett, PFP's coordinator<br />\nfor these volunteers, over one<br />\nhundred local organizations<br />\ndonated their time. As Ms. Faccett comments, \"volunteer<br />\ngroups are well-needed and are<br />\nvery welcomed.\" She adds that<br />\n\"they [PFP] ran short of groups<br />\nin the afternoon,\" but is appreciative for the help which they<br />\nreceived.

Known to the campus as<br />\nBeta, the group is composed of<br />\nsophomores,juniors, and seniors<br />\nwho are attempting to reactivate<br />\nthe Beta Theta Pi fraternity. As<br />\npart of their efforts to establish<br />\nthemselves, Beta volunteered<br />\ntheir assistance throughout the<br />\nday. According to Beta member<br />\nMike Baks, the volunteer work<br />\nwas \"a fun activity while helping<br />\nout the community.\" He adds<br />\nthat this type of work is nice since<br />\nit is \"not just giving, but it is getting involved\u2014that interaction\"<br />\nwith the people you are helping.<br />\nBeta began in the fall of this<br />\nsemester in answer to the campus' gradual move towards an increased involvement in the Greek<br />\nsystem. Presently, the campus is<br />\nabout 25 percent Greek. When<br />\nasked why begin a fraternity as<br />\nopposed to joining an existing<br />\none, Mr. Baks commented that<br />\n\"the student body is more diverse<br />\nthan a few years back\" and that<br />\n\"all interests are not represented<br />\nwithin the present Greek<br />\nsystem.\" When questioned as to<br />\nwhy Beta Theta Pi, Beta member<br />\nMark Rodeffer spoke of the<br />\nbrotherhood and the close relationships shared by not only the<br />\nmembers, but also the alumni. He<br />\nalso mentioned.that rather than<br />\nbring another new fraternity to<br />\ncampus, the students involved<br />\nwish to bring back one which<br />\nalready has a history.<br />\nThe history which Mr. Rodeffer refers to regards Beta as being the \"founding father\" of<br />\nHopkins' Greek system. As the<br />\nfirst fraternity at Hopkins, Beta<br />\nplayed an active role in sports and<br />\nsocial programs as well as<br />\nacademics. The chapter has been<br />\nabsent for more than twelve years<br />\nand the students are presently<br />\nworking with the administration<br />\nto bring the chapter back to the<br />\nHomewood campus. As one Beta<br />\nmember responds, \"Paddle for<br />\nPeople was the first of many<br />\nevents which. we hope to play an<br />\nactive role in at Hopkins as we attempt to return Beta to the position it once held\u2014a campus<br />\nleader.\" If all goes well, the<br />\nstudents would like to see Beta<br />\njoin the Greek system some time<br />\nin the spring.<br /><br />\nDIAL - A - DATE<br />\nThe Original, Still the Best!<br />\nJoin FREE, Call 24 Hours a Day<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\n, 486-2211<br />\nTO HEAR FEMALES<br />\nik<br /><br />\n976-7800<br />\nIN BALTO.

In<br />\nthe end it seems that U2's<br />\ndistinctly Irish/European sound<br />\nhas fallen as yet one more victim<br />\ncultural<br />\nof<br />\nAmerican<br />\nimperialism.<br />\nThe American approach has<br />\nalso had an affect on Bono's lyric<br />\nwriting. He has, perhaps naturally, become darker and more introspective over time, but he has<br />\nalso become much more direct<br />\nand overtly political, qualities that<br />\nI find alienating. Earlier U2 songs<br />\nwere much more ambiguous, and<br />\nthey concentrated on a montage<br />\nof images to convey their meaning. The interpretation of these<br />\nimages was left up to the listener,<br />\nwhich made each song much<br />\nmore of a personal experience.<br />\nBono, however, seems to have<br />\nlost confidence in both his earlier<br />\nlyrics' ability to convey his meaning and his listeners' ability to interpret them. Now he relies on<br /><br />\ndirect assertions and he is more<br />\nlikely to write a directly romantic or political song. Furthermore, these qualities seem to now<br />\nbe mutually exclusive, whereas<br />\nan earlier song like \"New Year's<br />\nDay\" could have multiple meanings and interpretations. Bono has<br />\nsimplified his lyric writing and<br />\nmade it more direct. In doing so<br />\nperhaps he has insured that the<br />\nmeaning of each song is clearer,<br />\nbut he has taken the listener out<br />\nof the loop and denied him the<br />\nability to make his own interpretations. Because of this, U2's<br />\nsongs may be less ambiguous, but<br />\nthey are also, to me at least, less<br />\npowerful.<br />\nClearly, U2 has changed quite<br />\na bit since 1980, when Boy was<br />\nreleased. Change is an inevitable<br />\nquality of life. I've changed since<br />\nfive years ago. The girl I sang to<br />\nhas been gone for two years, and<br />\nmany of my pre-Hopkins friends<br />\nhave gone on their own paths.

I pay $2.50 for<br />\nit, as if this whole ordeal isn't costing me<br />\nenough all ready. It smells like hospital<br />\nsheets, and it tastes like soap, but I<br />\nswallow fast.

They<br />\nseemed convinced that, despite<br />\ntheir 0-5 record, they had a good<br />\nfootball team and that victory<br />\nwould come shortly. But there<br />\ncomes a time when optimism<br />\nmust disappear and be replaced<br />\nby the sad truth of a dismal<br />\nseason. That time came last week<br />\nfor the Blue Jays, as they blew a<br />\n13-7 halftime lead and lost 26-13<br />\nto Muhlenberg.<br />\nHopkins is now 0-6 with an 0-4<br />\nrecord in the Centennial Conference, and things will not get<br />\nany easier.

But with an offense<br />\nthat is averaging less than 10<br />\npoints per game and a nagging<br />\nquarterback problem, Hopkins<br />\nmay be staring a winless season<br />\nright in the face.<br />\nThe first quarter of last Saturday's game against Muhlenberg<br />\nwas reminiscent of the Blue Jays'<br />\nseason thus far. The offense was<br />\nhampered by costly turnovers,<br />\nand the defense bailed them out.<br />\nWith eight minutes gone in the<br />\n;ame, Gary Rupert was inercepted by Mules' safety Mike<br />\nBaraldi, who returned the ball to<br />\nthe Hopkins 18 yard line. The<br />\nBlue Jay offense held them there,<br />\nhowever, and Muhlenberg was<br />\nforced to settle for a 31-yard field<br />\ngoal by Rob Powers. Eric<br />\nTrenaman, who replaced Rupert<br />\nlate in the first quarter, later<br /><br />\nthrew an interception to<br />\nMuhlenberg's cornerback John<br />\nRishko.

The victories over<br />\nCarnegie and Rochester established Hopkins as the 1988 University Athletic Association (UAA)<br />\nFestival<br />\nField<br />\nHockey<br />\nChampions.<br />\nThe Lady Jays beat Haverford<br />\nlast Thursday, October 13, in<br />\ntheir last home regular game of<br />\nthe season. Patti Ordonez tallied<br />\nHopkins' first goal on a pass from<br />\n\u2022Kathy Hart less than five minutes<br />\ninto the game. Kathy Kerring put<br />\nanother one past the Red Devil<br />\ngoalkeeper five minutes later on<br />\nanother pass from Hart. Five<br />\nminutes after that, Ordonez<br />\ngrabbed a rebound off the goalie<br />\npads to score the eventual gamewinning goal and put the Jays up<br />\n3-0. Jennifer Chun scored<br />\nHopkins' fourth and final goal in<br />\nthe beginning of the second half<br />\nas Hart earned her third assist of<br />\nthe game. Haverford staged a<br />\nlate-game rally, but they fell short<br />\nand lost 4-2.<br />\nThe Lady Jays played their first<br />\nUAA tournament game against<br />\nCarnegie Mellon on Saturday,<br />\nOctober 15, easily besting them<br />\n5-0. Jackie Fatula scored first for<br />\nHopkins on a penalty stroke,<br />\nwhile strong shots produced goals<br />\nfrom Ordonez, Hart, and two<br />\nfrom Julie Siegrist. Fatula and<br />\nRachel McGuckian each also had<br />\nan assist.<br />\nAccording to Coach Sally Beth<br />\nAnderson, \"We knew that we<br />\nweren't going to have much trouble with Carnegie Mellon, so to<br />\nget ready for Rochester, we concentrated on stick-to-stick passes<br />\nand other fine points of the game<br />\ninstead of just bombing the ball<br />\nup the field. We had some<br />\nbeautiful plays, and I'm really<br />\npleased with the teamwork.\"<br /><br />\nThe strategy must have worked, because the next day the Lady<br />\nJays exhibited their skill and<br />\nteamwork to beat Rochester in<br />\ndouble overtime, 4-3. Hopkins<br />\nscored first on penalty corner<br />\nplay #2, in which McGuckian hit<br />\nthe ball out from the endline to<br />\nHart, who then passed the ball to<br />\nFatula, who slammed it in for the<br />\nscore. Rochester then tied the<br />\ngame, but the Jays scored again<br />\nwhen McGuckian drove the ball<br />\nacross the goal and Ordonez<br />\nswept it in to put Hopkins ahead<br />\n2-1 at halftime.<br />\nRochester came back in the second half and was winning 3-2,<br />\nwhen the McGuckian-Hart-Fatula<br />\npenalty corner play #2 struck<br />\nagain, tying the score at 3-3 and<br />\nsending the game into overtime.<br />\nHopkins finally scored the gamewinning goal halfway into the second ten-minute overtime, when<br />\nFatula tallied on a pass from<br />\nHart. The Fatula-Hart combination produced three goals, a<br />\nperfect hat trick.<br />\nCoach Anderson said after the<br />\ngame, \"I think we really played<br />\nwell, coming from behind to win<br />\nin double overtime. The lead kept<br />\nswitching; it was a great game for<br />\nthe spectators to watch. As I said<br />\nbefore, we find a way to win.\"<br />\nThe Jays then beat their<br />\nBaltimore rivals, the Goucher<br />\nGophers, on Wednesday, October 19. Hopkins' three goals<br />\nwere scored by Fatula, Hart, and<br />\nMeredith Blitz, her first of the<br />\nseason. Herring had the single<br />\nassist.<br />\nThe 3-1<br />\nvictory<br />\nwas<br />\ncharacterized by some rough<br />\nplaying on Goucher's part, as<br />\nthey haven't beaten Hopkins in<br />\nthree years and weren't very happy about it. The Jays played a little sloppily at times, looking like<br />\na completely different team than<br />\nthey did against Rochester.<br />\n\"Still,\" said Anderson, \"it was<br />\ngreat to have a warm-up on grass<br />\nfor the MAC tournament. The<br />\ntransition to grass is always tough<br /><br />\nafter playing three games on<br />\nastroturf.\"<br />\nThe regular season ended with<br />\na three-way tie between Hopkins,<br />\nGettysburg, and Juniata for first<br />\nplace in the MAC Southwest Section. Since only two teams per<br />\nsection participate in the MAC<br />\nplayoffs, the three teams are<br />\nholding a mini-playoff for the<br />\nMAC playoffs. Hopkins randomly drew the bye, and will play<br />\nGettysburg, who beat Juniata on<br />\nWednesday in the first game of<br />\nthe mini-playoff, for the<br />\nSouthwest Section title on Friday,<br />\nOctober 21.<br />\nIf Hopkins beats Gettysburg,<br />\nthen the Jays will host Messiah at<br />\nhome on Monday, October 24, at<br />\n3:00 p.m., for the first round of<br />\nthe playoffs. If the Jays lose, then<br />\nthey travel on Monday to play<br />\nLebanon Valley, the Northwest<br />\nSection champion. The second<br />\nround will be played the following Wednesday, with the MAC<br />\nChampionship scheduled for<br />\nSaturday, October 29. Last year,<br />\nHopkins lost in the first round to<br />\nDrew University 3-2, in a hard<br />\nfought double overtime away<br />\ngame.<br />\nEven with the four wins and a<br />\nberth in the MAC tournament,<br />\nHopkins still dropped to fourth in<br />\nthe NCAA Division III South<br />\nRegion ranking, with Lynchburg<br />\nCollege moving into third. Lynchburg moved up because they<br />\nhave a comparable number of<br />\nwins but only lost to Salisbury 3-1<br />\nwhile Hopkins lost 3-0.

One<br />\nwas Dickinson College, who won<br />\n1-0 on a goal late in the first half,<br />\nand the other was the referees.<br />\nThe referees made many questionable calls leading to the ejection of one Hopkins player.<br />\nThe game began easily enough,<br />\nas the Blue Jays got many scoring opportunities early in the<br />\ngame. Warren Jones had a oneon-one with the goalie early in the<br />\ngame but couldn't finish it off.<br /><br />\nJim McKiernan followed with a<br />\nshot that narrowly missed the<br />\ngoal.<br />\nThe Hooters kept the pressure<br />\non the Red Raiders, but they<br />\ncouldn't put the ball into the net.<br />\nThe referees didn't help matters<br />\nmuch, as they stopped Blue Jay<br />\nattacks with untimely calls<br />\nthroughout the second half. For<br />\nthe first time all season, the team<br />\nlost control as fatigue and frustration set in. Five Hopkins players<br />\nreceived yellow cards, and one<br />\nreceived a red card.<br />\nHopkins rebounded the following Wednesday, as they defeated<br />\nWestern Maryland 2-0 under extremely windy conditions.

Balls in<br />\nthe air were tough to handle as the<br />\nsevere wind played havoc with the<br />\nball. TheNo-GoalPatrol played very<br />\nwell despite the absence of senior<br />\nco-captain Matt Lawrence, who<br />\nwas sidelined due to illness. Jerry<br />\nIrvine recorded his fourth and the<br />\nteam's sixth shutout of the<br />\nseason.<br />\nLast Saturday, the Hooters<br />\nraised their record to 6-4-1<br />\noverall and 1-1-1 in the conference with a victory over Swarthmore here on the turf at<br />\nHomewood. Hopkins played<br />\nsome of their best defense of the<br />\nseason in the 2-1 win over the Little Quakers, who were the best<br /><br />\nteam the Blue Jays have faced all<br />\nseason. Swarthmore was limited<br />\nto five shots on net and got their<br />\ngoal on a fluke mistake by goalie<br />\nJerry Irvine.<br />\nDown 1-0 at halftime, the<br />\nHooters came from behind, inspired by the fact that if they lost<br />\nthis game, they would be<br />\neliminated from the MAC<br />\nplayoffs. Craig Weinstein scored<br />\nthe team's first goal off a deflection of a Dan Sisbarro shot. Grenville Jones got the game-winning<br />\ngoal off an assist from Andy<br />\nNicholas. Jones took the pass<br />\nabout 40 yards from the goal, faking outside and then beating the<br />\ndefender to the inside. Jones, who<br />\nleads Hopkins in scoring, then<br />\nfired a bullet into the back of the<br />\nnet while his man was left on the<br />\nground behind him. The game<br /><br />\nwas marred by an injury to<br />\nsweeper Matt Lawrence, who<br />\nseparated his shoulder and whose<br />\nstatus is currently day by day.<br />\nThe Hooters will play two extremely important road games<br />\nthis week. Tomorrow morning<br />\nthey will face Franklin &amp; Marshall in Pennsylvania. On Tuesday they will play a South East<br />\nDivision foe, as they face<br />\nWidener. Victory at Widener<br />\ncould give the Blue Jays a<br />\nlegitimate shot at an MAC playoff<br />\nbid.

Senior Co-Captain Dan<br />\nDairaghi had his best race of the<br />\nyear, thus far, finishing second on<br />\nthe team and twenty-eighth<br />\noverall.<br />\nUndaunted by their insignifi-<br /><br />\ncant lapse at Dickinson, the Jays<br />\nunleashed their revenge upon the<br />\nunsuspecting Green Terrors of<br />\nWestern Maryland.

The Lady Jays finished<br />\n8-14 overall, equalling last year's<br />\nwin total, but failing to achieve<br />\ntheir goal of a .500 season.<br />\nDespite the indications of their<br />\nfinal record, the volleyball team<br />\ndisplayed a great deal of talent<br />\nand depth of play.

Even<br />\nthough the competition will be<br />\ntough (five of the UAA teams<br />\nwent on to Div III Nationals last<br />\nyear), the Jays remain loose and<br />\nfearless in regards to the task that<br />\nlays before them.<br />\nThe women's cross country<br />\nteam had its second consecutive<br />\nwinning weekend last Saturday<br />\nby defeating Elizabethtown,<br />\nGallaudet, and Western Maryland<br />\nin Westminister.
