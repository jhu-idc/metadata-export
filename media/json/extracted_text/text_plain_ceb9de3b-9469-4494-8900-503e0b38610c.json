We wish, if<br />\npossible, to correct this impression.<br />\nWe are in favor of fraternities. They have a definite place<br />\non the campus, and a great many benefits may be derived from<br />\nthem. They are not, however, as all-important as they seem to<br />\nfreshmen at this time of year, especially to those who have not<br />\nbeen noticed. On the part of these men there is far too often a<br />\nfeeling that they are missing all opportunity for .fellowship, and<br />\nthat in some manner they have been judged and found wanting.<br />\nNothing could be more untrue, but the prevalence of this belief<br />\nis one of the most unfortunate of American college life.<br />\nClass organization and activities present opportunities for<br />\nsome of the firmest friendships of college. The second belief,<br />\nwhich carries the worst sting, that failing to make a fraternity<br />\nimplies failure to measure up to undergraduate standards is<br />\nequally unfounded. The fact that every chapter has an individual policy, and that one dissenting vote will bar a candidate,<br />\nthough the other members favor him, is sufficient to dispel this<br />\nidea. Many fine and popular men at Hopkins have not belonged<br />\nto fraternities.<br />\nIf men who are being overlooked at this time will bear two<br />\nthings in mind, the problem will be greatly simplified. First, that<br />\nfraternities should be viewed as groups of friends, with different<br />\npolicies and standards, and not as judges to pass on a man's<br />\nworthiness or unworthiness. Second, that rushing is done of<br />\nnecessity quite hurriedly, so that the man who has not yet been<br />\nnotified will have a large chance in the next year or so of being<br />\ndiscovered by the group into 'which he fits best.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nMAILBAG<br />\n<br />\nD.

Also, they know their place!<br />\nHere, however,\u2014well, we'll leave it up to you.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nYou know, when the College for Teachers was incorporated<br />\ninto the University, it was just what its name would lead you<br />\nto believe\u2014a college for teachers. The classes were composed<br />\nprincipally of women teaching in local high schools who wanted<br />\nto obtain the benefits (Hurrah!) of a college education though<br />\nthey were actually somewhat past the collegiate age. Accordingly, afternoon and night classes were instituted.<br />\n*'<br />\nLittle did the proponents of the scheme dream that their<br />\naltruistic motives would, in naughty 1926, be thwarted by the<br />\nadmittance to the \"Teachers' College\" o- f painted, rouged, sweet;<br />\nbold young things who sauntered up and down the hitherto<br />\naustere pathways of the quadrangle, distracting the attention of<br />\nthe R. 0. T. C. from its drill masters! Hardly did they visualize the flashing of knees as one of the \"students\" scampered down<br />\nthe hall to a four o'clock class!<br />\nNow, instead of carrying on the roll books the names of<br />\npartly decayed forty-five year old schoolmarms, the C. for T. is<br />\nfull of flighty flappers from not only Baltimore city, but also<br />\nfrom such far away places as Towson and New York.<br />\nAnd now we have the advent of the educated flapper!

We have been requested to invite<br />\n:1,ou to the weekly election held by the class of 1929. This function will take place every Monday in the C. E. Hall.<br />\n<br />\nOf the many results the Half Century Celebration is expected or hoped to accomplish, local newspaper publicity for Hopkins has probably never been advanced as one. Publicity in the<br />\npress has of course been considered as a necessary means of advertising the event and arousing interest, but never as an end<br />\nin itself. The avowed aims of the movement, of which the Anniversary is a step, will probably be infinitely more far-reaching and<br />\nimportant, but the phase we mentioned has set us to thinking that<br />\nit deserves some attention.<br />\nDuring the past week, the Baltimore papers have been filled<br />\nwith news articles and special features concerning the celebration<br />\nitself and the University as a whole. Although these articles have<br />\nappeared only on account of the Anniversary, and are purely incidental to its plans, the fact remains that .for the first time in<br />\n<br />\nmany years, Hopkins is being brought prominently to the attention of Baltimoreans.<br />\nThe city has always taken Hopkins largely as a matter of<br />\ncourse. In the papers, for instance, outside of accounts of wholesome but asinine-appearing pursuits like class battles and banquet seasons, and a few incomplete and rather sensational articles last year on the New Plan, Hopkins does not figure very<br />\nlargely.<br />\nNaturally, the recent deluge of publicity will cease, in fact,<br />\nhas ceased; but the interest which has been aroused should not<br />\nwane altogether. If Baltimore can be kept alive to the real life<br />\nof the University, there may be interesting developments.<br />\n<br />\nPATRIOTIC COURTESY<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nOne can hardly believe that in a<br />\nuniversity such as ours, that there<br />\nare those who are ignorant of the<br />\npatriotic courtesy which should be<br />\nrendered when our national colors<br />\nHowever incredible this<br />\npass.<br />\nmay seem it is nevertheless true.<br />\nDuring the, reviewing of the R.<br />\n0. T. C. Unit by Col. Deams of<br />\nthe 3rd Corps Area the color sergeant was forced to order several<br />\npersons to remove their hats as the<br />\ncolors were passing. All complied<br />\nwith the order immediately, but by<br />\nno means in the proper way. This<br />\nis a sign of ignotance and carelessness and must be corrected. If one<br />\ncannot show the proper respect to<br />\nthe national colors and is unwilling<br />\nto take the trouble to learn, his or<br />\nher presence is undesired about the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nBut this is not all, for as the col'<br />\nors passed a man at the northern<br />\nend, of the' terrace of Gilman Hall<br />\nwith his head covered, was or\"<br />\ndered to remove his hat, but failed<br />\nto do so. Let' us hope that if he<br />\nunderstood the English language Ile<br />\nwas blind and partially deaf, if not<br />\n\u2014well such actions will not be tolerated.<br />\nFor the benefit of ignorant and<br />\ncareless persons the proper way of<br />\nsaluting the colors must be printed.<br />\nAll well informed and patriotic<br />\ncivilians render the following cone'<br />\ntesy: A man removes his hat hold'<br />\ning it opposite the left shoulder<br />\nwith the right hand, and a lad)<br />\nrises when the colors pass.

We wish, if<br />\npossible, to correct this impression.<br />\nWe are in favor of fraternities. They have a definite place<br />\non the campus, and a great many benefits may be derived from<br />\nthem. They are not, however, as all-important as they seem to<br />\nfreshmen at this time of year, especially to those who have not<br />\nbeen noticed. On the part of these men there is far too often a<br />\nfeeling that they are missing all opportunity for .fellowship, and<br />\nthat in some manner they have been judged and found wanting.<br />\nNothing could be more untrue, but the prevalence of this belief<br />\nis one of the most unfortunate of American college life.<br />\nClass organization and activities present opportunities for<br />\nsome of the firmest friendships of college. The second belief,<br />\nwhich carries the worst sting, that failing to make a fraternity<br />\nimplies failure to measure up to undergraduate standards is<br />\nequally unfounded. The fact that every chapter has an individual policy, and that one dissenting vote will bar a candidate,<br />\nthough the other members favor him, is sufficient to dispel this<br />\nidea. Many fine and popular men at Hopkins have not belonged<br />\nto fraternities.<br />\nIf men who are being overlooked at this time will bear two<br />\nthings in mind, the problem will be greatly simplified. First, that<br />\nfraternities should be viewed as groups of friends, with different<br />\npolicies and standards, and not as judges to pass on a man's<br />\nworthiness or unworthiness. Second, that rushing is done of<br />\nnecessity quite hurriedly, so that the man who has not yet been<br />\nnotified will have a large chance in the next year or so of being<br />\ndiscovered by the group into 'which he fits best.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nMAILBAG<br /><br />\nD.

Also, they know their place!<br />\nHere, however,\u2014well, we'll leave it up to you.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nYou know, when the College for Teachers was incorporated<br />\ninto the University, it was just what its name would lead you<br />\nto believe\u2014a college for teachers. The classes were composed<br />\nprincipally of women teaching in local high schools who wanted<br />\nto obtain the benefits (Hurrah!) of a college education though<br />\nthey were actually somewhat past the collegiate age. Accordingly, afternoon and night classes were instituted.<br />\n*'<br />\nLittle did the proponents of the scheme dream that their<br />\naltruistic motives would, in naughty 1926, be thwarted by the<br />\nadmittance to the \"Teachers' College\" o- f painted, rouged, sweet;<br />\nbold young things who sauntered up and down the hitherto<br />\naustere pathways of the quadrangle, distracting the attention of<br />\nthe R. 0.

Hardly did they visualize the flashing of knees as one of the \"students\" scampered down<br />\nthe hall to a four o'clock class!<br />\nNow, instead of carrying on the roll books the names of<br />\npartly decayed forty-five year old schoolmarms, the C. for T. is<br />\nfull of flighty flappers from not only Baltimore city, but also<br />\nfrom such far away places as Towson and New York.<br />\nAnd now we have the advent of the educated flapper!

Publicity in the<br />\npress has of course been considered as a necessary means of advertising the event and arousing interest, but never as an end<br />\nin itself. The avowed aims of the movement, of which the Anniversary is a step, will probably be infinitely more far-reaching and<br />\nimportant, but the phase we mentioned has set us to thinking that<br />\nit deserves some attention.<br />\nDuring the past week, the Baltimore papers have been filled<br />\nwith news articles and special features concerning the celebration<br />\nitself and the University as a whole. Although these articles have<br />\nappeared only on account of the Anniversary, and are purely incidental to its plans, the fact remains that .for the first time in<br /><br />\nmany years, Hopkins is being brought prominently to the attention of Baltimoreans.<br />\nThe city has always taken Hopkins largely as a matter of<br />\ncourse. In the papers, for instance, outside of accounts of wholesome but asinine-appearing pursuits like class battles and banquet seasons, and a few incomplete and rather sensational articles last year on the New Plan, Hopkins does not figure very<br />\nlargely.<br />\nNaturally, the recent deluge of publicity will cease, in fact,<br />\nhas ceased; but the interest which has been aroused should not<br />\nwane altogether. If Baltimore can be kept alive to the real life<br />\nof the University, there may be interesting developments.<br /><br />\nPATRIOTIC COURTESY<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nOne can hardly believe that in a<br />\nuniversity such as ours, that there<br />\nare those who are ignorant of the<br />\npatriotic courtesy which should be<br />\nrendered when our national colors<br />\nHowever incredible this<br />\npass.<br />\nmay seem it is nevertheless true.<br />\nDuring the, reviewing of the R.<br />\n0. T. C. Unit by Col. Deams of<br />\nthe 3rd Corps Area the color sergeant was forced to order several<br />\npersons to remove their hats as the<br />\ncolors were passing. All complied<br />\nwith the order immediately, but by<br />\nno means in the proper way. This<br />\nis a sign of ignotance and carelessness and must be corrected.
