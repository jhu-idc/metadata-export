The senior<br />\ndance will probably be held on<br />\nthat night.<br />\nOn Friday, a baseball game will<br />\nbe played between the Johns Hopkins team and a visiting team,<br />\nmost likely that of St. John's.<br />\nThe memorial exercises will be<br />\nheld on Saturday.

Class and department dinners will cap the climax<br />\nof the historical reunion, which<br />\nwill come to an end Saturday<br />\nnight.<br />\nThe interval between Saturday<br />\nand the Tuesday commencement<br />\nwill contain a number of very interesting features, in which the<br />\nMaryland Historical Society, the<br />\nLiberty Loan Committee and other<br />\norganizations will participate.<br />\nThe details will be announced<br />\nlater.<br />\n' The periods between the main<br />\nevents of the reunion will be interspersed with an equally entertaining series of secondary events.<br />\nThe inspection of Homewood is in<br />\ncharge of a committee consisting<br />\nof Dr. Barnett, chairman, Dean<br />\nLantane, Dr. Matthews and Dr.<br />\nWhitehead. There will be induct<br />\ned an exhibition of the architectural plans of the buildings which<br />\nwill be erected as soon as funds<br />\nare available. To many alumni,<br />\nand even to many undergraduates<br />\nwho have been here some time, a<br />\ntrip through the maze of tunnels<br />\n<br />\nThe 'Varsity lacrosse team<br />\nclosed an exceptionally successful<br />\nseason last Saturday, when it defeated the Crescent Athletic Club<br />\nat Brooklyn, 4 to 1. According<br />\nto \"Bill\" Schmeisser, it is the first<br />\ntime that we have beaten the<br />\nCrescents for 18 years. Yes, it's<br />\ntrue, for \"Bill\" knows, and since<br />\n1901 we have been unable to lower<br />\ntheir colors. In that year, the<br />\nHopkins team, led by Captain J.<br />\nEdward Tyler, defeated that allstar combination of Brooklyn, 3<br />\nto 1, in a steady downpour of<br />\nrain, even though we lost the<br />\nleague championship to Swarthmore. In that memorable game<br />\nour team was composed of famous<br />\nstickwielders such as Captain Tyler, \"Doc\" Abercrombie, \"Father<br />\nBill' himself, Harry Straus,<br />\nHatch, Putts and the Bernheim<br />\nbrothers.<br />\nBut history is being made now,<br />\nand 18 years from today we will<br />\ntalk of the famous team of 1919,<br />\nwho beat the Crescents on their<br />\nown ground, with all their older<br />\nstars in the game.<br />\nThe showing of the Black and<br />\nBlue on Saturday was especially<br />\ngratifying, since the team was<br />\nforced to Make the trip without<br />\nthe services of Sutton, Morley,<br />\nSilberstein and Stuart, all of<br />\nwhom were on the hospital list.<br />\nThus the attack especially was<br />\nseverely handicapped, but the combination which Assistant Coach<br />\n\"Al\" Voshell put on the field<br />\nproved very effective.<br />\nWith the first few minutes of<br />\nplay, the Crescents swept the 'Varsity off its feet and played the<br />\nball about the Hopkins goal for<br />\nseveral minutes. The team then<br />\nsteadied down and forced the play<br />\ninto the home team's territory.<br />\nDefandorf and Allen scored in<br />\nquick succession; and the half ended 2 to 0 in Hopkins' favor. The<br />\nplaying of the 'Varsity defense<br />\nwas wonderful and Daugherty had<br />\nonly a few oportunities, which he<br />\neasily handled.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins<br />\nagain got busy and Brennan<br />\ncounted the third goal. The ball<br />\nseesawed up and down the field<br />\nwith no score until O'Rourke tallied with a long shot for Crescent's only score. Baxley caught<br />\none in near the crease and brought<br />\nthe final score to 4-1.<br />\nThe game was rather slow, but<br />\nthere was a lot of good lacrosse<br />\non both sides. The playing of<br />\n<br />\nAfter the St. John's game last<br />\nSaturday, Harry Bloomsburg, our<br />\nsnappy little shortstop, was elected to captain the team through<br />\nthe season of 1920. Bloomsburg<br />\nhas held down the shortstop position for the last three years, his<br />\nteamwork in collaboration with<br />\nLittman around the keystone sack<br />\nhas been the star feature of the<br />\ndefense _of the team.<br />\nAs the St. John's game was<br />\ncalled on account of rain, the batting and fielding averages stand<br />\nas before. This means that Wallace wins with 8_ times at bat and<br />\n4 hits. The hitting ability of the<br />\nteam is well shown by the fact<br />\nthat 8 men are hitting above .300,<br />\nan exceptional feat on any ball<br />\nteam. The fielding, however, is<br />\nbelow par; Judefind, Egerton and<br />\nBenson being the only fielders in<br />\nthe .900 column. The team has<br />\nscored a total of 72 runs against<br />\nthe 73 of its opponents during the<br />\nentire season.<br />\nSt. John's has scheduled a postseason game to be played during<br />\nAlumni Week, so the relative<br />\nworth of the two teams may yet<br />\nbe determined.<br />\n<br />\nTwo new Southern Intercollegiate records were established at<br />\nHomewood in the dual meet between Hopkins and Lafayette,<br />\nwhich the latter won,62/<br />\n2to 491/<br />\n1<br />\n2.<br />\nThe feature event of the afternoon, the half-mile run, which<br />\nbrought together Beverly Smith,<br />\nthe Black and Blue star, and<br />\nKleinspehn, the collegiate titleholder for this distance, was<br />\nmarred by the disqualification of<br />\nCrawford, of Lafayette, who had<br />\nnot figured strongly, but crossed<br />\nthe finish line in front.<br />\nAs the runners came down the<br />\nhome-stretch Crawford unintentionally dowded the Hopkins runner off the track and was disqualified. The Hopkins officials, and<br />\nSmith himself, declined to accept<br />\nthe judges' verdict, and Crawford's victory was allowed to<br />\nstand. Smith got second honors<br />\nand Kleinspehn finished third.<br />\nThe new records were established in the mile run and in the<br />\nhammer throw. Crawford, who<br />\nwon the 880, accomplished the<br />\nmile in 4 minutes and 22 seconds,<br />\nbettering the mark made by Frederick C. Lee, of Hopkins, by more<br />\nthan 8 seconds. Leadbetter bettered his own record in the hammer throw by hurling it for a distance of more than 142 feet. His<br />\nold mark was 136 feet.<br />\nThe 100-yard dash went to Kunkle, who was not really pressed,<br />\nalthough Van Ness finished a good<br />\nsecond. In the 120-yard high hurdles, first place went to Lafayette, but Wood drew up at the end<br />\nand the finish was very close.<br />\nHopkins landed both places in<br />\nthe 440, Smith finishing first and<br />\nDriver second. At no time was<br />\nLafayette dangerous.<br />\nThe two-mile run was one of the<br />\nmost interesting races of the afternoon. Kemper had the pole<br />\nposition and assumed the lead<br />\non the outset. On the third<br />\nlap Graves moved out in front<br />\nand led for several trips around.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nBATTING, FIELDING AND PITCHING<br />\nAVERAGES.<br />\nBatting.<br />\nPC.<br />\nA.B.

This<br />\nis the first time that a University<br />\norchestra has been organized here<br />\nfor the study of serious music, and<br />\nits first concert in McCoy Hall<br />\ngave every indication that the<br />\nadventure would be successful.<br />\nEvery new undertaking enegetically and successfully prosecuted<br />\nmeans new fame, new glory and<br />\nmore college life for Hopkins. We<br />\ncongratulate most heartily Mr.<br />\nEdwin Litchfield Turnbull, the<br />\npresident of the association,<br />\nt, through whose unttring efforts<br />\nBopkins is to be placed, musically,<br />\nwe hope, on as high a plane as she<br />\n(occupies in many other'fields, Mr.<br />\nCharles H. Bochau, its able conductor, and the members of the<br />\norchestra.<br />\nWe hope that the undergraduates of the University will not<br />\nneglect the wonderful opportunity<br />\nof improving their musical talent,<br />\nand of engaging in a college activity with graduate students and<br />\nolder friends of Hopkins. We believe that the college is ready now<br />\nfor great expansion in every direction. Don't -bewail the imagined<br />\nlack of college life, but rather<br />\nsupport every activity which is as<br />\nworthy as this one.<br />\n<br />\nAthletic Comparisons.<br />\n<br />\nWe now have no reason to be<br />\nashamed of, or to make apologies<br />\nfor, the athletics of Johns Hopkins. On the other hand, as the<br />\ncollege year draws to a close,<br />\nevery member of the University<br />\nshould look with pride upon the<br />\nachievements of her representatives.<br />\nA comparison between the track<br />\nmeet held at Homewood last Saturday, Hopkins vs. Lafayette, and<br />\nthe meet between Princeton and<br />\nHarvard, held on the same day,<br />\nAt Homewood<br />\nis interesting.<br />\nbetter times were made in the<br />\n220-yard dash and in the mile run;<br />\nmore distance was made in the<br />\nhammer throw, discus throw and<br />\nhigh jump, than at the other meet.<br />\nOn the other hand, the times Of the<br />\nHarvard-Princeton meet in the two<br />\nmile and hurdles exceeded those<br />\nmade here, and they were also better in the broad jump ancl pole<br />\nvault events. Times registered for<br />\nboth meets in the 100-yard dash,<br />\n440-yard run and 881iyard run<br />\nwere identical.<br />\nIt is gratifying to think that<br />\nthe Hopkins track team, though<br />\nshe started the year under unfavorable conditions, and with no<br />\nvery bright outlook, has escaped<br />\nthat promised destiny, and by<br />\ndint of enthusiastic work has entered a class with some of the<br />\nlargest universities in the country.<br />\nWe hope that the new captain,<br />\nJohn R. Bartels, upon whose election we congratulate the team,<br />\nwill endeavor to enlarge the squad<br />\nand so provide Hopkins with runners who will win \"seconds\" and<br />\n\"thirds,\" as well as \"firsts.\"<br />\nOur lacrosse victory over the<br />\nCrescent Athletic Club should not<br />\nand does not go unnoticed.

There will be induct<br />\ned an exhibition of the architectural plans of the buildings which<br />\nwill be erected as soon as funds<br />\nare available. To many alumni,<br />\nand even to many undergraduates<br />\nwho have been here some time, a<br />\ntrip through the maze of tunnels<br /><br />\nThe 'Varsity lacrosse team<br />\nclosed an exceptionally successful<br />\nseason last Saturday, when it defeated the Crescent Athletic Club<br />\nat Brooklyn, 4 to 1. According<br />\nto \"Bill\" Schmeisser, it is the first<br />\ntime that we have beaten the<br />\nCrescents for 18 years. Yes, it's<br />\ntrue, for \"Bill\" knows, and since<br />\n1901 we have been unable to lower<br />\ntheir colors. In that year, the<br />\nHopkins team, led by Captain J.<br />\nEdward Tyler, defeated that allstar combination of Brooklyn, 3<br />\nto 1, in a steady downpour of<br />\nrain, even though we lost the<br />\nleague championship to Swarthmore. In that memorable game<br />\nour team was composed of famous<br />\nstickwielders such as Captain Tyler, \"Doc\" Abercrombie, \"Father<br />\nBill' himself, Harry Straus,<br />\nHatch, Putts and the Bernheim<br />\nbrothers.<br />\nBut history is being made now,<br />\nand 18 years from today we will<br />\ntalk of the famous team of 1919,<br />\nwho beat the Crescents on their<br />\nown ground, with all their older<br />\nstars in the game.<br />\nThe showing of the Black and<br />\nBlue on Saturday was especially<br />\ngratifying, since the team was<br />\nforced to Make the trip without<br />\nthe services of Sutton, Morley,<br />\nSilberstein and Stuart, all of<br />\nwhom were on the hospital list.<br />\nThus the attack especially was<br />\nseverely handicapped, but the combination which Assistant Coach<br />\n\"Al\" Voshell put on the field<br />\nproved very effective.<br />\nWith the first few minutes of<br />\nplay, the Crescents swept the 'Varsity off its feet and played the<br />\nball about the Hopkins goal for<br />\nseveral minutes. The team then<br />\nsteadied down and forced the play<br />\ninto the home team's territory.<br />\nDefandorf and Allen scored in<br />\nquick succession; and the half ended 2 to 0 in Hopkins' favor. The<br />\nplaying of the 'Varsity defense<br />\nwas wonderful and Daugherty had<br />\nonly a few oportunities, which he<br />\neasily handled.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins<br />\nagain got busy and Brennan<br />\ncounted the third goal. The ball<br />\nseesawed up and down the field<br />\nwith no score until O'Rourke tallied with a long shot for Crescent's only score. Baxley caught<br />\none in near the crease and brought<br />\nthe final score to 4-1.<br />\nThe game was rather slow, but<br />\nthere was a lot of good lacrosse<br />\non both sides. The playing of<br /><br />\nAfter the St. John's game last<br />\nSaturday, Harry Bloomsburg, our<br />\nsnappy little shortstop, was elected to captain the team through<br />\nthe season of 1920. Bloomsburg<br />\nhas held down the shortstop position for the last three years, his<br />\nteamwork in collaboration with<br />\nLittman around the keystone sack<br />\nhas been the star feature of the<br />\ndefense _of the team.<br />\nAs the St. John's game was<br />\ncalled on account of rain, the batting and fielding averages stand<br />\nas before. This means that Wallace wins with 8_ times at bat and<br />\n4 hits. The hitting ability of the<br />\nteam is well shown by the fact<br />\nthat 8 men are hitting above .300,<br />\nan exceptional feat on any ball<br />\nteam. The fielding, however, is<br />\nbelow par; Judefind, Egerton and<br />\nBenson being the only fielders in<br />\nthe .900 column. The team has<br />\nscored a total of 72 runs against<br />\nthe 73 of its opponents during the<br />\nentire season.<br />\nSt. John's has scheduled a postseason game to be played during<br />\nAlumni Week, so the relative<br />\nworth of the two teams may yet<br />\nbe determined.<br /><br />\nTwo new Southern Intercollegiate records were established at<br />\nHomewood in the dual meet between Hopkins and Lafayette,<br />\nwhich the latter won,62/<br />\n2to 491/<br />\n1<br />\n2.<br />\nThe feature event of the afternoon, the half-mile run, which<br />\nbrought together Beverly Smith,<br />\nthe Black and Blue star, and<br />\nKleinspehn, the collegiate titleholder for this distance, was<br />\nmarred by the disqualification of<br />\nCrawford, of Lafayette, who had<br />\nnot figured strongly, but crossed<br />\nthe finish line in front.<br />\nAs the runners came down the<br />\nhome-stretch Crawford unintentionally dowded the Hopkins runner off the track and was disqualified. The Hopkins officials, and<br />\nSmith himself, declined to accept<br />\nthe judges' verdict, and Crawford's victory was allowed to<br />\nstand. Smith got second honors<br />\nand Kleinspehn finished third.<br />\nThe new records were established in the mile run and in the<br />\nhammer throw. Crawford, who<br />\nwon the 880, accomplished the<br />\nmile in 4 minutes and 22 seconds,<br />\nbettering the mark made by Frederick C. Lee, of Hopkins, by more<br />\nthan 8 seconds. Leadbetter bettered his own record in the hammer throw by hurling it for a distance of more than 142 feet. His<br />\nold mark was 136 feet.<br />\nThe 100-yard dash went to Kunkle, who was not really pressed,<br />\nalthough Van Ness finished a good<br />\nsecond. In the 120-yard high hurdles, first place went to Lafayette, but Wood drew up at the end<br />\nand the finish was very close.<br />\nHopkins landed both places in<br />\nthe 440, Smith finishing first and<br />\nDriver second. At no time was<br />\nLafayette dangerous.<br />\nThe two-mile run was one of the<br />\nmost interesting races of the afternoon. Kemper had the pole<br />\nposition and assumed the lead<br />\non the outset. On the third<br />\nlap Graves moved out in front<br />\nand led for several trips around.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\nBATTING, FIELDING AND PITCHING<br />\nAVERAGES.<br />\nBatting.<br />\nPC.<br />\nA.B.

This<br />\nis the first time that a University<br />\norchestra has been organized here<br />\nfor the study of serious music, and<br />\nits first concert in McCoy Hall<br />\ngave every indication that the<br />\nadventure would be successful.<br />\nEvery new undertaking enegetically and successfully prosecuted<br />\nmeans new fame, new glory and<br />\nmore college life for Hopkins. We<br />\ncongratulate most heartily Mr.<br />\nEdwin Litchfield Turnbull, the<br />\npresident of the association,<br />\nt, through whose unttring efforts<br />\nBopkins is to be placed, musically,<br />\nwe hope, on as high a plane as she<br />\n(occupies in many other'fields, Mr.<br />\nCharles H. Bochau, its able conductor, and the members of the<br />\norchestra.<br />\nWe hope that the undergraduates of the University will not<br />\nneglect the wonderful opportunity<br />\nof improving their musical talent,<br />\nand of engaging in a college activity with graduate students and<br />\nolder friends of Hopkins. We believe that the college is ready now<br />\nfor great expansion in every direction. Don't -bewail the imagined<br />\nlack of college life, but rather<br />\nsupport every activity which is as<br />\nworthy as this one.<br /><br />\nAthletic Comparisons.<br /><br />\nWe now have no reason to be<br />\nashamed of, or to make apologies<br />\nfor, the athletics of Johns Hopkins. On the other hand, as the<br />\ncollege year draws to a close,<br />\nevery member of the University<br />\nshould look with pride upon the<br />\nachievements of her representatives.<br />\nA comparison between the track<br />\nmeet held at Homewood last Saturday, Hopkins vs. Lafayette, and<br />\nthe meet between Princeton and<br />\nHarvard, held on the same day,<br />\nAt Homewood<br />\nis interesting.<br />\nbetter times were made in the<br />\n220-yard dash and in the mile run;<br />\nmore distance was made in the<br />\nhammer throw, discus throw and<br />\nhigh jump, than at the other meet.<br />\nOn the other hand, the times Of the<br />\nHarvard-Princeton meet in the two<br />\nmile and hurdles exceeded those<br />\nmade here, and they were also better in the broad jump ancl pole<br />\nvault events. Times registered for<br />\nboth meets in the 100-yard dash,<br />\n440-yard run and 881iyard run<br />\nwere identical.<br />\nIt is gratifying to think that<br />\nthe Hopkins track team, though<br />\nshe started the year under unfavorable conditions, and with no<br />\nvery bright outlook, has escaped<br />\nthat promised destiny, and by<br />\ndint of enthusiastic work has entered a class with some of the<br />\nlargest universities in the country.<br />\nWe hope that the new captain,<br />\nJohn R. Bartels, upon whose election we congratulate the team,<br />\nwill endeavor to enlarge the squad<br />\nand so provide Hopkins with runners who will win \"seconds\" and<br />\n\"thirds,\" as well as \"firsts.\"<br />\nOur lacrosse victory over the<br />\nCrescent Athletic Club should not<br />\nand does not go unnoticed. It was<br />\na brilliant culmination to a highly.<br />\nsuccessful season, and it speaks<br />\nwell indeed not only for the players, but also for the coaching staff.<br />\nThis year has given Hopkins a<br />\nstrong athletic \"boost,\" and with<br />\nMr. Murphy.installed as director,<br />\nwe feel sure that it is only the beginning of a long series of successful seasons.<br />\nPennsylvania and Delaware Beat<br />\nHopkins Racqueters.<br /><br />\nThe tennis team made its final<br />\nbow last Saturday, when it was<br />\ntaken into camp by the Delaware<br />\nCollege racqueters by a score of<br />\n6-0.
