Our football<br />\nteam has just one victory to its<br />\ncredit this season, and there is just<br />\nthe<br />\none more game to be played.<br />\ngreat majority of the early season<br />\ngames the team was pitted against<br />\nheavy, experienced men and not<br />\neven the most optimistic could<br />\nhave hoped for a string of Hopkins<br />\nvictories against such teams as<br />\nBrown, Carlisle and Swarthmore.<br />\nBut last Saturday's defeat carried<br />\nwith it a sting that hurt it was<br />\na bitter dose for any Hopkins man<br />\nto ,rwallow. St. John's boasted a<br />\nstring of defeats, a lot of nerve<br />\nand an undownable determination<br />\nto lick Hopkins\u2014nothing more\u2014<br />\nup to Saturday noon. Meantime,<br />\nHopkins had climbed one-third of<br />\nthe way to the State championship, tied two strong teams and<br />\nmade a creditable showing against<br />\nthree very strong teams, and\u2014<br />\nwhat is much more\u2014Hopkins had<br />\n<br />\na memorable defeat from last year<br />\nto avenge, and she knew it. After<br />\nthe mass-meeting, bonfire and<br />\ndemonstration of Friday, Hopkins<br />\nwas ready to stake its all on Saturday's game.<br />\nThe story of the game is familiar enough to every one of us.<br />\nThat much is settled, and we offer<br />\n110 excuses, no alibis. Nevertheless, every Hopkins man ought to<br />\nbe so keenly sore and so fighting<br />\nmad and so savagely restless for<br />\nrevenge that he would give his<br />\nright arm for some substantial victim for his seething temper. The<br />\ngods have saved us our right arms<br />\n\u2014they have already delivered into<br />\nour hands the very choicest kind<br />\nof a victim: Maryland State College is coming to Hopkins with a<br />\nvictory over St. John's, confidently<br />\nexpecting to beat us as she did last<br />\nyear on Thanksgiving Day of this \u2022<br />\nweek. To those who were not here<br />\nor who have tried to forget it, let<br />\nus remind you that State ran<br />\nroughshod over us last year, whitewashed us, overwhelmed us 54 to<br />\n0. If there is anywhere a Hopkins<br />\nman who isn't thirsty for State's<br />\nblood, who won't yell and fight<br />\nuntil State is beaten and beaten<br />\nbadly, he isn't fit to be called a<br />\nHopkins man. Hopkins is fighting mad ; Hopkins wastes about as<br />\nmuch love now on State as she<br />\ndoes on Kaiser Bill. Hopkins must<br />\nbeat State! Get State!

These<br />\nwords have often been heard, but<br />\non nearly every occasion were they<br />\nuttered with a different basic<br />\nmeaning, with reference to different values which may be placed<br />\non college life.<br />\nThe foundation of all 'culture at<br />\ncollege is the college itself. If it<br />\nbe a bad one the culture will likewise be bad; if it be a good one<br />\nthe culture will likewise be good.<br />\nCulture at college begins in the<br />\nfreshman class. If the proper restrictions are put upon the freshman Ile will be benefited by them<br />\nand the college spirit will be built<br />\nup.<br />\nWith particular reference to<br />\nthe restrictions placed upon freshmen at Johns Hopkins much may<br />\nbe said. Everyone is human, and<br />\nany rule that singles out a person<br />\nor group of persons to the extent<br />\nof embarrassment is sure to meet<br />\nwith very strong opposition. And<br />\nrightly so, for even in gatherings<br />\nthat may not be of people educated<br />\nas we are it is considered very impolite to embarrass anyone, while<br />\nin society circles such a thing<br />\nwould be most rude. Therefore,<br />\nsuch regulations as the wearing of<br />\na freshman cap, the wearing of a<br />\nfreshman button large enough to<br />\nbe used for a target and the wearing of black socks, all of which are<br />\ntoo much like advertising features,<br />\nare sure to meet with opposition<br />\nfrom the freshmen. If the upperclassmen of Johns Hopkins would<br />\nbe more free to associate with the<br />\nfreshmen, treating them like<br />\nbrothers of one large family, instead of holding their heads above<br />\nthe freshmen as the Kaiser holds<br />\nhis head above his people, they<br />\nwould find that the school spirit of<br />\nthe University would be increased<br />\nthree-fold. Such spirit as would<br />\nthen be exhibited would be freely,<br />\nproudly and joyously shown,<br />\nwhereas the spirit which is now<br />\nbeing exhibited is a spirit which<br />\nhas fear for one of its causes.<br />\nHere; as in many other colleges, a<br />\ngross mistake is made and it is a<br />\nsad thing that the faculty supports such unjust regulations.<br />\nHere it is that so often an honest<br />\nschool spirit is kept in check; and<br />\nbecause it is kept in check the<br />\nfreshman very often fails to obtain his first, proper, cultural<br />\ntraining.<br />\nJ.

Our football<br />\nteam has just one victory to its<br />\ncredit this season, and there is just<br />\nthe<br />\none more game to be played.<br />\ngreat majority of the early season<br />\ngames the team was pitted against<br />\nheavy, experienced men and not<br />\neven the most optimistic could<br />\nhave hoped for a string of Hopkins<br />\nvictories against such teams as<br />\nBrown, Carlisle and Swarthmore.<br />\nBut last Saturday's defeat carried<br />\nwith it a sting that hurt it was<br />\na bitter dose for any Hopkins man<br />\nto ,rwallow. St. John's boasted a<br />\nstring of defeats, a lot of nerve<br />\nand an undownable determination<br />\nto lick Hopkins\u2014nothing more\u2014<br />\nup to Saturday noon. Meantime,<br />\nHopkins had climbed one-third of<br />\nthe way to the State championship, tied two strong teams and<br />\nmade a creditable showing against<br />\nthree very strong teams, and\u2014<br />\nwhat is much more\u2014Hopkins had<br /><br />\na memorable defeat from last year<br />\nto avenge, and she knew it. After<br />\nthe mass-meeting, bonfire and<br />\ndemonstration of Friday, Hopkins<br />\nwas ready to stake its all on Saturday's game.<br />\nThe story of the game is familiar enough to every one of us.<br />\nThat much is settled, and we offer<br />\n110 excuses, no alibis. Nevertheless, every Hopkins man ought to<br />\nbe so keenly sore and so fighting<br />\nmad and so savagely restless for<br />\nrevenge that he would give his<br />\nright arm for some substantial victim for his seething temper. The<br />\ngods have saved us our right arms<br />\n\u2014they have already delivered into<br />\nour hands the very choicest kind<br />\nof a victim: Maryland State College is coming to Hopkins with a<br />\nvictory over St. John's, confidently<br />\nexpecting to beat us as she did last<br />\nyear on Thanksgiving Day of this \u2022<br />\nweek. To those who were not here<br />\nor who have tried to forget it, let<br />\nus remind you that State ran<br />\nroughshod over us last year, whitewashed us, overwhelmed us 54 to<br />\n0. If there is anywhere a Hopkins<br />\nman who isn't thirsty for State's<br />\nblood, who won't yell and fight<br />\nuntil State is beaten and beaten<br />\nbadly, he isn't fit to be called a<br />\nHopkins man. Hopkins is fighting mad ; Hopkins wastes about as<br />\nmuch love now on State as she<br />\ndoes on Kaiser Bill. Hopkins must<br />\nbeat State! Get State!

If the proper restrictions are put upon the freshman Ile will be benefited by them<br />\nand the college spirit will be built<br />\nup.<br />\nWith particular reference to<br />\nthe restrictions placed upon freshmen at Johns Hopkins much may<br />\nbe said. Everyone is human, and<br />\nany rule that singles out a person<br />\nor group of persons to the extent<br />\nof embarrassment is sure to meet<br />\nwith very strong opposition. And<br />\nrightly so, for even in gatherings<br />\nthat may not be of people educated<br />\nas we are it is considered very impolite to embarrass anyone, while<br />\nin society circles such a thing<br />\nwould be most rude. Therefore,<br />\nsuch regulations as the wearing of<br />\na freshman cap, the wearing of a<br />\nfreshman button large enough to<br />\nbe used for a target and the wearing of black socks, all of which are<br />\ntoo much like advertising features,<br />\nare sure to meet with opposition<br />\nfrom the freshmen. If the upperclassmen of Johns Hopkins would<br />\nbe more free to associate with the<br />\nfreshmen, treating them like<br />\nbrothers of one large family, instead of holding their heads above<br />\nthe freshmen as the Kaiser holds<br />\nhis head above his people, they<br />\nwould find that the school spirit of<br />\nthe University would be increased<br />\nthree-fold. Such spirit as would<br />\nthen be exhibited would be freely,<br />\nproudly and joyously shown,<br />\nwhereas the spirit which is now<br />\nbeing exhibited is a spirit which<br />\nhas fear for one of its causes.<br />\nHere; as in many other colleges, a<br />\ngross mistake is made and it is a<br />\nsad thing that the faculty supports such unjust regulations.<br />\nHere it is that so often an honest<br />\nschool spirit is kept in check; and<br />\nbecause it is kept in check the<br />\nfreshman very often fails to obtain his first, proper, cultural<br />\ntraining.<br />\nJ.
