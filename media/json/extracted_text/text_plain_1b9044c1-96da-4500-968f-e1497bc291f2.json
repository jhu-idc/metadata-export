Such sociohistorical<br />\nanalyses of the ensuing article<br />\nwould be mere mudslinging.<br />\nEconomics as it is taught<br />\nhere on the introductory level<br />\ntries very hard to avoid the fact<br />\nthat it is necessarily political. It<br />\n<br />\navoids the tact that many of its<br />\nfundamental notions are by no<br />\nmeans facts. A student who<br />\ntakes sufficient time to analyze<br />\nthe concepts which he is being<br />\nspoon-fed will soon find himself<br />\nfar behind and failing the course.<br />\nPerhaps at upper levels, classes in.<br />\npolitical economy encourage criticism of its principles, but on<br />\nthe introductory level it is nearly<br />\nimpossible. The critical mind<br />\nsoon finds itself confronted<br />\nwith graphs and charts which<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\nAre They Really Listening?<br />\nFirst: Congratulations to all parties.<br />\ninvolved for arriving at what seems to be<br />\nnot only a fair compromise, but ultimately<br />\nthe best way of instituting plus/minus<br />\ngrading. Having the new system take effect<br />\nstarting with next year's freshmen should<br />\neliminate the potential for contradiction in<br />\nand subsequent misreading of student<br />\ntranscripts. The grade system itself, as<br />\nargued earlier here, will provide a more<br />\naccurate measure of performance at an<br />\ninstitution which is by nature competitive<br />\nand goal-oriented.<br />\nSpecial praise is due the Student<br />\nCouncil and its Education Committee for<br />\nso vigorously sounding student opinion of<br />\nthe originally proposed across-the-board<br />\nimplementation of plue/minus grading, and<br />\nfor representing that opinion to the Academic Council. The Academic Council, in<br />\nturn, should be commended for being, in<br />\nthe end, properly sensitive to student<br />\nwishes on this issue.<br />\nBut: There is one aspect of this<br />\nhappy conclusion which merits some<br />\nthought before it is tucked away and<br />\nforgotten, namely Dean Owen's statement<br />\nthat \"This decision shows that we listen to<br />\nthe students.\" A proper response to that<br />\nstatement is, \"Well, yes and no.\" First of<br />\nall, \"we\" means different people in different situations. The faculty and the administration are by no means such a unified<br />\n<br />\nentity that any student should make the<br />\nmistake of thinking of them as \"we.\" Until<br />\nnow, perceiving its unpopularity with the<br />\nstudents, administration members have<br />\nmade a visible effort to disassociate themselves with the faculty on the matter of.<br />\nplus/minus grading, calling themselves<br />\npowerless in the matter.<br />\nMore important, however, there are<br />\nother issues, as yet unresolved, where it is<br />\nby no means clear that students are being<br />\nlistened to. The decision to ban rock music<br />\nfrom Spring Fair, though it was officially<br />\nmade by the Student Council, was reached<br />\nlong ago by the administration. The way in<br />\nwhich the ban has been rescinded represents a placating gesture more than anything else; it would be interesting to see<br />\nwhat would happen if the Student Council<br />\nvoted to rescind the ban entirely. It is<br />\ndoubtful whether the autonomy the SC<br />\nseemed to enjoy in enacting the ban would<br />\nstill go unchallenged \u2014 the point being that<br />\nthe administration wants no music at the<br />\nFair, and that, for the most part, is how it's<br />\ngoing to be. No serious compromise \u2014<br />\nsuch as the one presented by David Fishkin<br />\n(see story, page 1) \u2014 would be seriously<br />\nentertained by the administration.<br />\nSo: This issue of plus/minus grading<br />\nhas a happy ending, and let's keep our eyes<br />\non the next one.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\nEthics Board<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nand is presided over by the<br />\npresiding official of the Ethics<br />\nBoard.

Carter<br />\nsaid that of approximately 6,000<br />\narticles he wrote as a reporter<br />\nand writer for the Delta Democratic-Times in Greenville, Miss.,<br />\none third were wrong, another<br />\nthird inadvertently misled the<br />\npublic and only about 10<br />\npercent were relevant to the<br />\nfuture. Carter warned that the<br />\nlay media observer should not<br />\n\"mistake the absence of lying<br />\nfor the presence of truth.\"<br />\nHaving worked as both a<br />\njournalist and a spokesman to<br />\nthe press, Carter, currently a<br />\npress critic for the public television series Inside Story,<br />\nencourages the public to be<br />\nskeptical of the printed word<br />\nand maintains that one cannot<br />\nexpect to get all the facts on a<br />\nparticular issue from a single<br />\npublication.

Usually, the<br />\nparty concerned does not provide information to the press<br />\neither because it feels that the<br />\npublic will not comprehend the<br />\nsituation or is concerned that<br />\npremature disclosure will distort<br />\nthe events and promote inquiries.<br />\nFor these reasons, the public often receives brief flashes of<br />\nnews once the situation has been<br />\nresolved and no public participation in decision making is<br />\npossible. Citing the aborted<br />\nattempt to rescue the American<br />\nhostages in Iran, Carter said that<br />\nsometimes members of the State<br />\nDepartment are also kept in the<br />\ndark, as well as the press.<br />\nCarter also pointed to the<br />\nprocess of information dissemination as a contributing factor in<br />\ndistorting news items. \"You<br />\ncan't tell it in 90 seconds,\" said<br />\nCarter to emphasize that a<br />\ntelevision news broadcast provides too little time to get an<br />\naccurate picture of the issue<br />\n,Lcross.

We try to<br />\nhave different purposes coming<br />\ntogether which promote mutual<br />\ngrowth \u2014 like raising money for<br />\nthe tutoring program (the tutoring program sponsored by Chaplain Chester Wickwire, from<br />\nwhom Chester's Place takes<br />\nits name), while providing a<br />\nforum for musical expression,<br />\nand a place for people to meet<br />\nand talk. The combination is<br />\nultimate growth.\"<br />\nUltimate growth or not,<br />\nChester's couldn't draw its<br />\ncrowds without good music. The<br />\nperformers are divided evenly<br />\nbetween students who have<br />\nmanaged to work up an act and<br />\noutside musicians. The quality,<br />\nespecially in light of the fact<br />\nthat Chester's does not pay or<br />\naudition its acts, is high.<br />\n\"Our acts range from the<br />\nridiculous to the sublime, with<br />\nmost falling pretty squarely in<br />\nbetween,\" Simball says.\"On the<br />\nwhole, we've had more superexcellents than total flops, and<br />\nnobody ever gets booed off stage<br />\nhere. We always have three acts<br />\nin an evening, so if the first act is<br />\nbad, people relax and talk and<br />\nwait for the next one. It's a<br />\nnon-paying audience, so they<br />\ntend to be pretty friendly.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\n<br />\nfriendly<br />\n<br />\naudiences,<br />\n<br />\nSimball says, are the incentive<br />\nfor both professional outside<br />\nmusicians and first-time student<br />\nacts.<br />\n\"The students, who may<br />\nnot have had much time to<br />\npractice can feel safe getting b.<br />\nchance to play for an audience<br />\nhere,\" he says. \"The professionals can relax and have a good<br />\ntime, and a lot of them start<br />\ndeveloping a following at<br />\nChester's that will come to see<br />\nthem at other places. We're<br />\nalways booked up a month in<br />\nadvance, so they must get<br />\nsomething out of it.\"<br />\nGroups that have gotten<br />\nstarted through Chester's Place<br />\ninclude Poetic Justice (formerly<br />\nNo Mercy, and begun by thenHopkins student Ned Solomon);<br />\nthe Charm City Reactors, who<br />\nhad their first gig there; and<br />\nguitarist Howard Markman,<br />\nformerly with the group Freewater.<br />\n\"It's a good place for<br />\nmusicians to meet each other,\"<br />\nSimball says. \"It's easy to go up<br />\nto the performers here and talk<br />\nto them,, whereas it can be<br />\npretty intimidating in a club.\"<br />\nSimball, who is a 23-yearold medical student at Hopkins,<br />\nand Fishkin, a '81 graduate of<br />\nthe University of Maryland Law<br />\nSchool, have been successful this<br />\nyear in extending the music<br />\nof Chester's Place to other nights<br />\nand other locations. They have<br />\nsponsored four Saturday night<br />\nconcerts in the Great Hall in<br />\nLevering, and helped a freshman<br />\n<br />\nin his efforts to open up<br />\nChester's Place on another night.<br />\nIn addition, they have brought<br />\nin poetry readings, puppet<br />\nshows, and political speakers.<br />\n\"We try to have mindexpanding things, to present<br />\nwhat's going on on the other<br />\nside of the six o'clock news,\"<br />\nSimball says. \"It can be hard to<br />\ndo at Hopkins, where people are<br />\nout to conquer the world and<br />\ndon't have time for this stuff.<br />\nHopkins has a real problem<br />\ndealing with the outside world.<br />\nThere could be a lot more<br />\nentertainment at this campus,<br />\nbut there's an attitude that the<br />\nthings that happen here should<br />\n<br />\nbe for the students only, and<br />\nthe community mustn't be let in<br />\n\u2014 I think that's what is behind<br />\nthe Student Council's decision<br />\nto ban rock music from the<br />\nSpring Fair. They're crawling<br />\nback into their shell.\"<br />\nIt's been a good year for<br />\nChester's Place in many respects,<br />\nbut one major problem faces it<br />\nin the future: both Simball and<br />\nFishkin may be partially or<br />\ncompletely unavailable after this<br />\nsummer. Simball will be on<br />\nmedical call, and Fishkin may be<br />\nleaving Baltimore.<br />\n\"Somebody new has to<br />\ncome along and give this place<br />\npriority for existing,\" Fishkin<br />\n<br />\nsays, and Simball adds, \"It<br />\nwould be a real crime to let this<br />\nplace fade away because there<br />\nwas no one to run it, when there<br />\nis certainly no lack of people<br />\nwho want to come. We always<br />\nhave good crowds here, even in<br />\nthe summer.\"<br />\nBoth Simball and Fishkin,<br />\nas well as the part-time workers<br />\nwho help them out, work on a<br />\nstrictly volunteer basis \u2014 in fact,<br />\nthey don't even get free beer.<br />\nFishkin says the job demands<br />\nup to about seven hours a week,<br />\nmost of it falling on Wednesday<br />\nnights, and essentially consists of<br />\nordering and selling beer, setting<br />\nup the stage, and cleaning up.<br />\n<br />\nDeclining Attendance Forces<br />\nRat Entertainment Changes<br />\ncont. from p.<br />\nBrian O'Leary, another<br />\nsenior employee of ARA, said<br />\n\"tight management\" during the<br />\nopening weeks of school turned<br />\npeople away from the Rat. The<br />\nfirst Thursday the employees<br />\ndenied people entrance because<br />\nof the fire hazard. \"The management,\" he pointed out,<br />\n\"could have explained the reasons for not allowing the people<br />\nin the door.\" Blaxburg did not<br />\nblame the management, but<br />\nadmitted, \"A lot of things<br />\nthat went wrong the first couple<br />\nof weeks led to the decline of<br />\nthe Rat.\"<br />\nHiggins said that those in<br />\n<br />\ncharge at the Rat have not<br />\nadvertised sufficiently, especially<br />\nin the News-Letter. Blaxburg<br />\nagreed and blamed ARA for<br />\nfailing to promote its beer<br />\nspecials. However, he added<br />\nthat the manager of ARA is a<br />\nperson with an enormous job<br />\nwho must struggle to keep the<br />\nentire Levering operation from<br />\nsinking, much less worry about<br />\nbeer bashes.<br />\nBlaxburg said that he regularly spends between three and<br />\nfour hours per week putting up<br />\nposters around campus. He<br />\ncited the band The Accused and<br />\nits appearance at the Rat as an<br />\nexample of the limitations of<br />\n<br />\nadvertising \u2014 even though hundreds of posters had previously<br />\nbeen placed around campus, the<br />\nband drew the second lowest<br />\nattendance of the year. \"Postering,\" Blaxburg concluded, \"has<br />\naccomplished all it can.\"<br />\nThe Rat will change its<br />\nformat next semester in an<br />\nattempt to draw more business<br />\nand cut costs. Blaxburg explained that the Rat will have no<br />\nSaturday night bands, and<br />\nThursday night disco will be<br />\nmore frequent. \"You wouldn't<br />\nbelieve how many people have<br />\nasked me for Disco Night,\" he<br />\nlamented.<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n,<br />\n,<br />\n.<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br />\n<br />\n1The Johns Hopkins University Office of Special Events presents<br />\n<br />\nTHE WINTER S(XSI'ICE<br />\nWI-I()I,E EAR CHRISTMAS CEI,EBRXIION<br />\n<br />\nA Spectacular Concert in a Spectacular Cathedral Setting by<br />\n<br />\nCONSOITI'<br />\nWINTER<br />\nTHEPAULWith<br />\nVocalist Susan Osborn<br />\nFRIDAY.

The<br />\nEthics Board will make this<br />\nrecommendation to the Committee of Undergraduate Studies, of which it is a subcommittee.<br />\nThough the Ethics Board<br />\nwould require professors to<br />\ndistribute the blue books, the<br />\nBoard would not decide whether students must sign the<br />\nstatement of academic integ-<br />\n<br />\nrity. Professors may require<br />\nstudents to do so, however.<br />\nKathleen Connally, chairman of the Ethics Board, says<br />\nit is likely that the University<br />\nwould provide the blue books<br />\n\"at no cost to the departments.\"<br />\nThe blue books would be<br />\ncoded to prevent students from<br />\nduplicating them.<br />\nOne of the purposes of the<br />\nnew blue books, according to<br />\nConnally, would be to make<br />\nstudents aware of the Ethics<br />\nCode. The Ethics Board believes this would \"make them<br />\nthink before cheating,\" said<br />\nConnally.<br />\nBecause professors would<br />\ndistribute the blue books at the<br />\nbeginning of exams, students<br />\nwould be unable to hide crib<br />\n<br />\nnotes in them.<br />\nThe Ethics Board will not<br />\nrequire students to sign the<br />\nacademic integrity statement<br />\nprinted on the front of the<br />\nblue books because \"some<br />\nstudents feel this is putting<br />\nthem down,\" said Connally.<br />\nA student's signature on<br />\nthe academic integrity statement would not make prosecution on a charge of cheating<br />\neasier, Connally says. \"We are<br />\nonly trying to raise student<br />\nconsciousness. It doesn't hurt<br />\nthe student at all,\" she emphasized.<br />\nLast spring, the Ethics<br />\nBoard suggested to professors<br />\nthat they include the statement<br />\nof academic integrity on<br />\nexams. So far, according to<br />\nConnally, only about a quarter<br />\n<br />\nhave done so. The Ethics<br />\nBoard hopes to have more<br />\ncooperation by providing free<br />\nblue books already printed<br />\nwith the statement.<br />\nThe Ethics Board is also<br />\nwaiting for the Academic<br />\nCouncil to consider several<br />\namendments to its constitution. The Student Council has<br />\nalready passed these amendments.<br />\nThe major change in the<br />\nconstitution would be to allow<br />\na professor and a student<br />\naccused of cheating to settle<br />\nthe case without a hearing<br />\nbefore a panel of the Ethics<br />\nBoard. To settle without a<br />\nhearing, the student would<br />\nhave to admit to guilt and sign<br />\na letter saying so.<br />\nThe present constitution<br />\n<br />\nFish wrap Media<br />\ncont. from p. 5<br />\nAnother reason that the<br />\npress does not adequately inform the people, according to<br />\nCarter, is thlt it tries to please a<br />\npublic that does not know what<br />\nit wants by giving it what it<br />\nthinks it wants. In working for a<br />\nsmall-town paper, Carter learned<br />\nthat according to the polls, the<br />\npeople of the area were not<br />\nconcerned about foreign policy;<br />\nthey wanted to read more local<br />\nnews. Rather than appeasing<br />\nthe public and devoting the<br />\npaper to local news, Carter feels<br />\n<br />\ndoes not allow cases of cheating to be settled without a<br />\nhearing, but, according to<br />\nConnally, they often are because some professors believe<br />\n\"a hearing is too much trouble<br />\nor will not be fair.\" The<br />\namended constitution \"will be<br />\nmore compatible with the way<br />\nthings are,\" said Connally.<br />\nThe Ethics Board would<br />\nrequire professors to report all<br />\ncases of cheating even if they<br />\nare settled without hearings.<br />\nThis would allow the Board to<br />\nnotify students who have admitted to guilt of all the<br />\nconsequences they may face.<br />\nThe Ethics Board would<br />\nalso enter the name of any<br />\nstudent who has admitted to<br />\nguilt on a list it keeps of all<br />\nstudents found guilty.<br />\n<br />\nWook$<br />\n<br />\nit is the journalist's duty to<br />\npresent the issues that concern<br />\nthe reader, including foreign<br />\npolicy, in a manner in which the<br />\nreader can understand them.<br />\n<br />\ncont. from p. 5<br />\ntheories that his ability to see<br />\nwhether these theories fairly<br />\nI represent truth will be virtually<br />\ndestroyed.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, Carter encouraged<br />\nthe public to provide constructive criticism to the press in an<br />\nattempt to coax the professionals in the media industry, whom<br />\nhe feels are quite capable, to<br />\nprovide information that is complete and relevant.<br />\n<br />\nThat the Political Economy<br />\nDepartment just about refuses to<br />\nteach the Marxist viewpoint tells<br />\nthe astute viewer .that this<br />\ndepartment is not concerned<br />\nwith seeking truth, but rather<br />\nwith reproducting its own notions, however fallacious they<br />\nmay be.<br />\n<br />\nLunch Special<br />\nFree Soup with any sub<br />\nFree draft beer and salad with<br />\nany dinnerfrom 11:00-3:00<br />\nTry our daily lunch and dinner<br />\nspecials.<br />\nSome of our specialties are:<br />\nVeal Platters<br />\nShishkabob<br />\nLarge Greek Salad<br />\nPizza<br />\n<br />\nrRallis Restaurant<br />\n2025 East Monument St.<br />\n732-8570<br />\n<br />\nSports Medicine<br />\nA talk by<br />\n<br />\nDr. William Howard<br />\n<br />\nDirector of Sports Medicine,<br />\nUnion Memorial Hospital<br />\nWednesday,December9<br />\n7:00 pm L-V Room<br />\n<br />\nSponsored by AED<br />\n<br />\n\fThe Assassination ofJohn<br />\nEDITOR'S NOTE:<br />\nThe News-Letter emphasizes that Livingstone's<br />\nstatus as an investigator is unofficial. The ideas presented here are his own, based on conversations he conducted,and may or may not hold some of the answers<br />\nto this much-obscured case. What is most important is<br />\nthat the contradictions in the Warren Commission's<br />\nreport be recognized, and that people continue to ask<br />\nquestions.<br />\n<br />\nby Robin<br />\nJohnson<br />\nWhat really happened in Dallas, November 22,<br />\n1963, on the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated?<br />\nWe may never know; as times has passed the event has<br />\nbecome cloudier rather than clearer, investigations have<br />\nmuddled existing facts rather than uncovering new<br />\nones.<br />\n<br />\nHarrison Edward Livingstone<br />\nMany individuals have dedicated themselves to<br />\ntrying to discern the facts involved. Many theories have<br />\nbeen offered, different motives discussed, various<br />\nconspirators named, but the underlying revelation of<br />\nthe opposing facts and fantasies is that the Warren<br />\nCommission report is grossly inaccurate, some would<br />\nsay, to the point of fabrication.<br />\nOne such person, who does not believe the Warren<br />\nCommission's report and who is working to uncover<br />\nthe, truth about the event, is Harrison Livingstone.<br />\nLivingstone is a Harvard graduate with a law degree. He<br />\nhas taught creative writing at Harvard and is now a<br />\nnovelist, poet and playwright.<br />\n\"I am primarily an artist,\" said Livingstone.<br />\n\"Kennedy was like a breath of fresh air that stimulated<br />\nthe performing arts and gave great hope to all writers.\"<br />\nLivingstone recently gave a lecture on the Homewood campus about his discoveries in the Kennedy<br />\ncase. The News-Letter has since spoken with Livingstone in order to present a fuller account of the<br />\ndevelopments in the Kennedy assassination case as<br />\nposited by Livingstone and other unofficial investigators with whom he has come in contact (although he<br />\nworks alone) in his pursuit of the truth. Livingstone<br />\ndiscussed some.of the more widely accepted theories,<br />\nhis own beliefs as to who was involved in the assassination and why, and then gave a document of statements<br />\nfrom the doctors and nurses who first worked on the<br />\nbody. This document is the result of Livingstone's own<br />\nresearch and questioning of these medical personnel in<br />\nthe past two and a half years.<br />\n<br />\nTHEMAGIC<br />\nBULLET THEORYThe Warren Commission maintains that Lee<br />\nHarvey Oswald acted alone and fired three shots at<br />\nKennedy from the sixth floor of a building behind<br />\nKennedy's limousine. Livingstone, agreeing with other<br />\nassassination experts, believes that there were at least<br />\nsix, and possibly seven, shots fired in all. This fact has<br />\nbeen ascertained from sound recordings of the<br />\n<br />\nNew Testimony as reported<br />\nDallas, Texas \u2014 More than a dozen doctors and nurses who either treated former President John F. Kennedy<br />\nduring his final hours or participated in the autopsy of the slain president have recently stated that the official<br />\nautopsy photographs of the back of Kennedy's head do not show the same gunshot wounds which they saw and<br />\nreported to the Warren Commission in 1963-64.<br />\nThe autopsy photos, which were among many items of evidence in the assassination kept secret by the Warren<br />\nCommission, were never officially shown to the Dallas medical witnesses during the various investigations into the<br />\nkilling. After looking at them for the first time recently, however, nearly all of the nurses and doctors involved in<br />\nthe shooting said that the pictures do not show the wounds as they actually were.<br />\nThe testimony of these witnesses, which was assembled recently in a series of tape recorded interviews in<br />\nDallas and several other cities, presents the most significant challenge to the official explanations of the assassination to date.<br />\nAmong other things, the startling testimony indicates that members of the Warren Commission covered up<br />\ninformation about the 1963 murder; that there were three or more gunmen on the scene; that the president was<br />\nshot from in front, as well as from behind, in a well-planned ambush which was the result of a broad conspiracy.<br />\n\"That's not the way I remember it,\" said Dr. Richard Dulany, a medical resident who was on duty in the<br />\nemergency room when Kennedy was brought in, later looking at a copy of an official autopsy photograph. According to Dr. Dulany, there is a \"definite conflict\" between the wounds as portrayed in the photo and the wounds<br />\nwhich he observed in the emergency room.<br />\nThere were at least 22 witnesses in Dallas who have described a \"large hole in the back of the head.\" Dr.<br />\nDulany insists that the photo does not show the large, gaping wound which had blown out the back of the president's head.<br />\nDr. Paul Peters, professor and chairman of the Urology Department at the University of Texas Southwestern<br />\nMedical School at Parkland, also questions the accuracy of the disputed photograph. Dr. Peters told the Warren<br />\nCommission: \"We saw the wound of entry in the throat and noted the large occipital wound.\" After seeing the<br />\npictures, he said, \"I don't think it's consistent with what I saw. There was a large hole in the back of the head<br />\nthrough which one could see the brain. But that hole does not appear in the photograph.\"<br />\n(The President's widow also described a severe wound at the back of the head to the Commission: \"But from<br />\nthe back, you could see, you know, you were trying to hold his hair and his skull on...\"<br />\nDoris Nelson, a Dallas nurse who was the supervisor of the emergency room when Kennedy was brought there,<br />\nand who helped to treat the dying President said that government autopsy photos of the skull are \"not true.\"<br />\n\"There was no hair,\" she said, while disputing the most controversial photograph, which barely shows a small entry<br />\nwound in the cowlick area, which is four inches from where the autopsy report, itself, describes it. \"Thele wasn't<br />\neven any hair back there [on the back of the head]. It was blown out.\"<br />\nThe positions of the head wounds are crucial in determining the direction from which the various shots which<br />\nstruck Kennedy were fired. A large, gaping wound at the back of the skull, for example, would indicate that a<br />\nbullet had exited there after entering the front of the head. In addition, it would directly contradict the findings of<br />\nthe Warren Commission, which concluded that the president had been shot only twice,from behind.<br />\nThe descriptions of a gaping-wound at the back of the skull also point up a major conflict between the findings<br />\nof the Warren Commission and the testimony which it took from the President's window, Secret Servicemen,<br />\nDallas medical witnesses and the autopsists \u2014 all of whom at that time described a large exit wound at the back of<br />\nthe head.<br />\nUntil recently, autopsy photographs of the President's shattered skull had been withheld from both the<br />\nwitnesses and the public by a Warren Commission edict which prohibited the release of many items of evidence<br />\nuntil 2039.<br />\nBut that changed during the recent House Select Committee on Assassinations hearings on the case, when,<br />\nafter a burglary of the Committee's safe, the autopsy photos were removed. After news of the burglary broke,<br />\nabout a year after, the Committee was forced to publish copies of the key pictures \u2014 those showing the back, neck<br />\nand head of the murdered president.<br />\nClaiming that the photographs were too \"gory,\"<br />\nhowever, the Committee actually published exact<br />\ntracings of them. It was these tracings, which are<br />\ndescribed as being accurate down to the last detail,<br />\nwhich the Dallas medical witnesses recently evaluated<br />\nfor this report. (One witness, however, Dr. Malcolm<br />\nPerry of the Cornell Medical Center, was shown prints<br />\nof the actual photographs by Sun reporters in 1979,<br />\nand also strongly denounced them as being inaccurate.)<br />\nIf the medical witnesses who have disputed the<br />\naccuracy of the photographs are correct, the authenticity of the pictures becomes highly suspect and the<br />\npossibility emerges that the pictures \u2014 along with other<br />\nevidence \u2014 may have been forged. If so, a key to<br />\nuncovering the identity of those behind the conspiracy<br />\nmay lie in determining who possessed the ability and<br />\naccess which would have been needed to fabricate the<br />\nClose-up photograph of the posterior head wound<br />\nevidence.<br />\nThe list of medical witnesses who have challenged the autopsy photos includes Dr. Robert McClelland, professor of surgery at the University of Texas Medical School in Dallas. Seventeen years ago, he told the Warren Commission that he stood at the head of the operating table in the emergency room in \"...Such a position that I could<br />\nvery closely examine the head wound, and I noted that the right posterior portion of the skull had been extremely<br />\nblasted. It had been shattered, apparently, by the force of the shot. . .in such a way that you could actually look<br />\ndown into the skull cavity.\"<br />\nRecently, after viewing a sketch of the gaping head wound which had been shown by an independent investigator, Dr. McClelland said that it accurately portrays what he \"vividly remembers\" seeing on the operating table<br />\nafter the President was rushed into emergency. He firmly rejected the autopsy photos.<br />\nMargaret Hood (Margaret Henchliffe at the time) had been an emergency room nurse for 12 years prior to the<br />\nassassination. The nurse, who helped wheel the wounded President into the room and later prepared his body for<br />\nthe coffin, recently drew a sketch of the wound on a skull model provided by reporters. That sketch also showed a<br />\nlarge wound at the back of the head. \"You couldn't see much of the wound,\" said Ms. Hood.\"It didn't affect his<br />\nface or ears at all. . .it was more to the back.\" Ms. Hood also strongly disavowed the photographs.<br />\nIN. Ronald C. Jones, a professor of surgery who was Parkland Hospital's chief resident in surgery at the time<br />\nof the murder, originally described for the Warren Commission \". . .what appeared to be an exit wound in the<br />\nposterior portion of the skull.\" He also rejected the autopsy photos, and drew an outline with his finger of a large<br />\nhole.at the back of an imaginary head. In addition, he described the drawing which Dr. McClelland had approved as<br />\n\"close.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fI Kennedy:New Evidence<br />\nd by Harrison Livingstone<br />\nPatricia Gustafson (then Patricia Hutton), another<br />\nemergency room nurse at the time of the shooting,<br />\nhelped to wheel the president from the limousine into<br />\ntreatment. Ms. Gustafson, testifying before the Warren<br />\nCommission, outlined a \". . .massive opening on the<br />\nback of the head.\" Recently, describing an effort to<br />\nplace a pressure bandage on the head wound,she said:<br />\n\"I tried to do so, but there was really nothing to put a<br />\npressure bandage on. It was too massive. So he told me<br />\njust to leave it be.\" Asked if she was sure about the<br />\nlocation of the wound, she said yes: \"It was the back<br />\nof the head,\" she said, while rejecting the autopsy<br />\nphotos.<br />\nDr. Fouad Bashour was an associate professor of<br />\nmedicine in cardiology at the time of the shooting. Interviewed by this reporter at his office in 1979, Dr.<br />\nBashour insisted that .the official photo whiCh he was<br />\nbeing shown did not accurately depict the location of<br />\nthe major wound. \"Why do they cover it up?\" he asked<br />\nseveral times. \"This is not the way it was.\"<br />\nDr. Charles Baxter, interviewed the same day, who<br />\nhad earlier told the Warren Commission, \"There was a<br />\nlarge, gaping wound in the back of the skull,\" also questioned the autopsy photos.<br />\nAfter being shown the most controversial photo, Dr.<br />\nMarion Jenkins, who told the Warren Commission,\"There<br />\nwas a great laceration on the right side of the head (temDrawing depicting the posterior head wound<br />\nporal and occipital)...even to the extent that the cerebelthat, because. ..No, you want to know<br />\nlum had protruded from the wound,\" blurted: \"No, not like that. Not like<br />\nback.\"<br />\nwhat it really looked like? Well, that picture doesn't look like it from the<br />\nDr. Jenkins demonstrated several times, by touching his own and a reporter's head, that the large exit wound<br />\nhad been located on the back of the skull: \"You could tell at this point with your fingers that it was scored out,<br />\nthat the edges were blasted out.\"<br />\nDr. Charles J. Carrico, now a professor of surgery at the University of Washington in Seattle, was a general<br />\nsurgeon in residency at Parkland when the president was shot \u2014 and the first doctor to reach him. He told the<br />\nWarren Commission about a large gaping wound, a five-by-seven centimeter defect in the posterior skull, which he<br />\nobserved in the occipital region. But he has not been interviewed since.<br />\nIn addition to these medical figures, three other physicians who were involved in treating the stricken president \u2014 Doctors Gene C. Akin, Jackie Hunt and Adolph Giesecke, Jr. \u2014 have not fully endorsed the autopsy pictures.<br />\nTwo crucial medical witnesses, meanwhile, have not yet been interviewed,about the case. Dr. Kemp Clark, who<br />\nwas the senior physician on duty in the Parkland \"trauma room\" when the wounded president was brought in,<br />\nrefuses to comment \u2014 although he described for the Warren Commi\u00a7sion a \".. .a laLge wound in the right occiput,<br />\nextending into the parietal region.\" Diana H. Bowron, a British nurse who worked in the Parkland emergency room<br />\nin 1963, could not be located as of this writing. However, Ms. Bowron did tell the Warren Commission: \"The<br />\nPresident was moribund. He was lying across Mrs. Kennedy's knee, and there seemed to be blood everywhere.<br />\nWhen I went around to the other side of the car, I saw the condition of his head.. .the back of his head. . .it was<br />\nvery bad;I just saw one large hole.\"<br />\nOther inconsistencies between the official inquiries into the shooting and the recent Comments by medical<br />\nwitnesses include:<br />\n\u2014 The official Dallas death certificate describes the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the left temple.<br />\n\u2014 According to the recently interviewed medical witnesses, the,President had been shot in the throat, from in<br />\nfront, in addition to the head-shot.<br />\n\u2014 The autopsists, themselves, insisted that the autopsy photographs did not portray an entry wound at the<br />\nback of the head, where they noted it. As an appendix to the House Assassinations Committee report stated: \"The<br />\npanel continued to be concerned about the persistent disparity between its findings and those of the autopsy<br />\npathologists and the rigid tenacity with which they maintained that the entrance wound was at or near the external<br />\noccipital protuberance, rather than at the cowlick, where an apparent entry wound now appears.\"<br />\n\u2014 The chief autopsist, Dr. James Humes, answered a question about bullet wounds from Commissioner Allen<br />\nDulles(who had earlier been fired by Kennedy as director of the CIA) by saying that he believed it was impossible<br />\nfor the bullet \". . .to have exited from other than behind.\" (Dr. Clark also told the Commissioners that the \"<br />\nMissile had gone in and out of the back of the head.\"<br />\nOn the basis of these comments by the medical witnesses \u2014 and of the official autopsy report which was<br />\nprinted in 1964 \u2014 it seems probable that the President was hit twice in the head, once from behind and once from<br />\nin front. The report said that there was an entry wound 2.5 centimeters from the occipital protuberance and a large<br />\ndefect in the back of the head extending into the occiput.<br />\nSome investigators have determined that a tape made during the shooting actually has seven shots on it.<br />\nThe president would appear to have been hit four times, from the weight of the evidence; John Connally hit<br />\nwith a fifth bullet, bystander James Tague hit with a sixth bullet, and the sidewalk hit with the seventh bullet.<br />\nFilms, photographs and other evidence show clearly that the president was shot from in front as well as from<br />\nbehind, and that John Connally was hit with a separate bullet, as he has always claimed.<br />\nPhotographs show clearly that the wound in the president's throat occurred long before the Warren Commission said that it copld have, and that it had to come from in front, as the doctors in Dallas had said. This wound<br />\nwas unrelated to the back wound,and not related to the bullet which struck Connally.<br />\nAccording to most legal scholars, the testimony of witnesses who are physically present at the scene of contested events and who can then testify about what they saw there takes precedence over all other forms of<br />\nevidence.<br />\nIf so, then the weight of the evidence in the still-unsolved, 18-year-old Kennedy slaying(the House Committee<br />\nofficially declared in 1979 that the President had been killed as the result of a conspiracy, and that it believed there<br />\nhad been more than one gunman and more than three shots fired) clearly rests on the testimony of those who first<br />\nlooked at and treated the dying President.<br />\nThe first, spontaneous reactions of these medical witnesses to the autopsy photographs, which the government<br />\nhas heretofore refused to show to them, are too strong and too definite to be ignored. It seems highly unlikely that<br />\nall of them could have been mistaken about what they saw.<br />\n<br />\nincident. Various experts have different theories<br />\nabout where the shots came from and even about the<br />\nnumber of assassins. Livingstone believes there were<br />\nseveral assassins firing from different directions,<br />\nincluding from the Grassy Knoll at Dealy Plaza (also<br />\ntheorized by David S. Lifton, author of Best Evidence)<br />\nand from a manhole to the left of the approaching<br />\nlimousine. Medical experts' statements on the wounds,<br />\nand films of the incident, corroborate this theory.<br />\nThis analysis would explain the implausibility of<br />\nwhat has come to be known as the Magic Bullet Theory<br />\n\u2014which refers to the explanation given by the government for how three gunshots managed to hit Kennedy<br />\nthree times, Texas governor John Connally once, and a<br />\nbystander once: It was said that the bullet passed<br />\nthrough Kennedy's body (through the throat) and into<br />\nConnally's back. The point of contention is that there<br />\nwere more grains of metal left in the two victims than<br />\nwas lost from the virtually whole \"magic bullet\".<br />\nAccording to Livingstone's theory in which six<br />\nshots were fired:<br />\n\u2014 The first shot missed, hitting a bystander.<br />\n\u2014 The second shot, from in front of the motorcade, hit Kennedy in the throat (the hole in the throat<br />\nwas later enlarged to insert a breathing tube).<br />\n\u2014 The third shot hit Kennedy in the back.<br />\n\u2014 The fourth shot hit Texas governor John Connally from the back.<br />\n\u2014 The fifth and sixth shots hit Kennedy, almost<br />\nsimultaneously, with the fifth shot hitting him in the<br />\nback of the head and the sixth shot, from the front,<br />\nhitting him in the front of the head.<br />\n<br />\nTHE CONSPIRACY<br />\nAccording to Livingstone, the conspiracy developed<br />\namong powerful political and business forces in the<br />\ncountry. The event was the firing of top CIA officials<br />\nafter the Bay of Pigs fiasco. This was only the proverbial straw though,as Livingstone sees it, the underlying<br />\ncause was that military, industrial, financial, and<br />\nintelligence leaders, as well as political figures, were<br />\nunable to control Kennedy.<br />\n\"Leadership of the Republican party condoned<br />\nand ratified these murders,\" Livingstone said, including<br />\namong the Republican leadership the names of Richard<br />\nNixon, Gerald Ford, Allan Dulles, and Ronald Reagan.<br />\n\"Reagan, as Governor of California, refused to<br />\nextradite an important witness for the conspiracy trials<br />\nin New Orleans,\" he said. \"Nixon, as vice-president,<br />\ndirectly controlled the intelligence people who were<br />\ninvolved at the operational level of the murder.\"<br />\nLivingstone also contends that the CIA was<br />\ninvolved in a \"misinformation campaign\" in order to<br />\nmisdirect research. One key argument Livingstone uses<br />\nto support this is the fact that at least 13 of the eyewitnesses to the assassination were dead before the Warren<br />\nreport was issued. The odds against so many witnesses<br />\ndying coincidentally are astronomical.<br />\n<br />\nTHEMOHVES<br />\nLivingstone cited many motives for the conspira-tors to have taken such drastic action:<br />\nThe Vietnam War \u2014 A month before the assassination,<br />\nKennedy had begun to withdraw troops from Vietnam.<br />\nKennedy planned to pull 1000 troops out by Christmas<br />\nand to have all troops out by 1965. According to<br />\nLivingstone, the conspirators were pro-war because of<br />\nthe economic benefits for their circle.<br />\nForeign Relations \u2014 Kennedy was seeking detente with<br />\nRussia and Cuba through secret negotiations.<br />\nNuclear Arms \u2014 .The \"radical right\" objected to the<br />\nnuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union because<br />\nit slowed development of nuclear arms.<br />\nBay of Pigs \u2014 The firing of the CIA's high command<br />\nwas part of an effort by Kennedy to bring the CIA<br />\nunder his control. The deputy director's brother was<br />\nthe mayor of Dallas, which facilitated the murder and<br />\ncover-up.<br />\nThe confounding problem of the entire episode is<br />\nthat such an important historical event could be so<br />\npoorly or dubiously documented, so badly investigated, and next to impossible to reinvestigate. Livingraises<br />\nstone's theory may not be iron-clad but it<br />\nthe possibility of a government being able to hide,<br />\ncover up or forge evidence involved in the assassination<br />\nof a President.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12 / DECEMBER 4, 1981<br />\n<br />\nAelterie do/Aktit DAT es<br />\n<br />\nMCA<br />\n<br />\nHair Cutting & Design<br />\nFor Men & Women<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nTAKE IT<br />\nEASY!<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nCall Days Evenings & Weekends<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\nN<br />\nEducational Cotter<br />\n<br />\n243-1456<br />\nCome Visit Our Center<br />\n<br />\nTEST PREPIUtATION<br />\nSPECIALISTS SINCE 1938<br />\n3121 St. Peal Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21218<br />\nCenters in.Maior US Cities Toronto, Puerto Rico and Zurich, Switzerland<br />\n<br />\n,k0<br />\n<br />\n100 E. 33rd St. I BLOCK FROM CAMPUS<br />\nFor Appointment Tues - Sat - Call<br />\n235-7083<br />\nSpecial Student Rate - with I.D.<br />\n<br />\nHEALTHY MALES 19---marmg\"\"N\"135<br />\nMay be eligible to<br />\nearn $100-$500 NOW<br />\nP-K Laborat ones asks you to join our program<br />\nas a participant in physician's supervised studies<br />\nCall for more information<br />\n<br />\nPHARMA\u2014KINETICS<br />\n366-2030<br />\n104 E.25th St.<br />\n9A.M.-5 P.M.<br />\nCurrently, we have a special need<br />\nfor a non-smoker group as well<br />\n<br />\n00p0000000000000000000000<br />\n<br />\nUNLIMITED 000<br />\n0\u00b0 HAIR<br />\n3120 Saint Paul Street<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n235-0741<br />\no<br />\nO 00000Ce0000-0Q000000000000<br />\n<br />\nIf your hair isn't becoming to you!<br />\nYou should be coming to us.<br />\n<br />\nOpen Monday through Saturday 10-6<br />\n<br />\nril=ex=x1c===xsc=Disc=a4=Dest==x<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n1011 W.36th Street<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland<br />\n<br />\nCall 332-4150<br />\n<br />\n467-24E<br />\n<br />\nWhy spend so much money for a meal at<br />\nthe other restaurants?

This is more<br />\neasily said than done because Gilliam, of<br />\ncourse, is the American member of<br />\nMonty Python, the writer and animator<br />\nwhose cartoons gave such a bizarre<br />\ntexture to the group's famed Flying<br />\nCircus TV series. Gilliam wrote the<br />\nscreenplay for Time Bandits with fellow<br />\nPythoner Michael Palin, and a third<br />\nmember of the group, John Cleese, has a<br />\nrole in the film. All this would lead<br />\naudiences to anticipate outrageous and<br />\nirreverent comedy in the style of Monty<br />\n<br />\nPython and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian,<br />\nand Gilliam's only other solo effort, the<br />\nmorbidly amusing Jabberwocky. But<br />\nwhile Time Bandits is funny, it's hardly<br />\nscandalous; it's a benign fantasy which<br />\nrecalls The Wizard of Oz more than<br />\nanything else.<br />\nThe movie concerns itself with the<br />\nadventures of Kevin (Craig Warnock), an<br />\n11-year-old boy from England in whose<br />\nbedroom cliset a group of rustic midgets<br />\nappears one night. They are fleeing the<br />\nwrath of the Supreme Being, creator of<br />\nA seafaring ogre(Peter Vaughan)and his wife(Katherine Helm)nd) haul in the bandits.<br />\nthe world, and carry with them a map<br />\nthey have stolen from him which pin- Kevin, unhappy with the bourgeois audience as possible.

It seems Gilliam and prominent dwarfs, and from Warnock,<br />\ncompany are playing to as wide an whose portrayal of the innocent Kevin is<br />\nsurprisingly competent.

Rabe, a Vietnam veteran, returned<br />\nto the states in the late '60s, filled with<br />\ntormenting memories of the war. Shortly<br />\nthereafter, he established himself as a<br />\ntalented new playwright with a series of<br />\nplays centering around his experiences in<br />\nSoutheast Asia.<br />\nRabe wrote Sticks and Bones in 1971<br />\n-before America's \"Peace with Honor\"<br />\n- before the fall of Saigon in '75 - and<br />\nbefore America would comfortably push<br />\naside the senseless bloodshed of some 13<br />\nyears. But to see the play for its historical<br />\nimportance alone is to ignore it as a<br />\nmasterful piece of theater. The play<br />\nbelongs to a form only to itself. It is<br />\ncomic, black, tragic, and absurd - all at<br />\nonce. Traditional categories can't quite<br />\ndescribe Rabe's mixture of forms. Yet<br />\none thing certainly can be said of the<br />\nplay: it is always disturbing and comes to<br />\nlife at the Fells Point Theater.<br />\nAs the lights come up we find<br />\nourselves seated in the average American<br />\nhome of Ozzie and Harriet Nelson and<br />\ntheir guitar-playing son, Rickie.

In the<br />\nstory, an author, F,* has just written a<br />\nrevealing book about his past affiliation<br />\nwith the CIA, and is beginning work on<br />\nhis second book, which he hopes will<br />\nrope that magical aura of sea adventurefantasy to a staunch mizzen mast of<br />\nrealism. This author is not a spy any*Professor Barth used flash cards to<br />\nindicate which of the characters was<br />\nspeaking. Unfortunately these cards only<br />\ncontained the first letter of their names,<br />\nwhich led to the untimely forgetting of<br />\ntheir names.<br />\n<br />\nHe's just writing books on his<br />\nyacht as he sails from Baltimore to<br />\nWashington, the Eastern Shore, and<br />\nplaces unknown. His relationship with<br />\nhis wife S is the most important aspect of<br />\nthe novel.<br />\nBut a friend D from his CIA past<br />\ntries to drag our author F and his story<br />\nback into a spy thriller. F has just had a<br />\nheart attack, and D speaks of a CIA drug<br />\nwhich causes heart attacks. D tells F that<br />\nthe government would like him to investigate certain mysterious islands in his.<br />\nyacht. F refuses; this isn't a spy novel,<br />\nafter all. Moments later, F has a mild<br />\nheart seizure.<br />\nBarth has both integrated and<br />\nrejected aspects of his earlier works. Like<br />\nLost in the Funhouse, Sabbatical is very<br />\nself-reflexive, constantly drawing attention to the fact that the novel is merely a<br />\nnovel. A former writer/ex-spy is trying to<br />\nsteer the plot of his life away from spying<br />\nBut some<br />\nand writing about spies.<br />\n<br />\nmore.<br />\n<br />\nsuperior novelist is steering his life back<br />\ninto turbulent intrigues.

All that remains<br />\nof the play is continued references to<br />\nmenstruation, which the reader suspects<br />\nis somehow related to the tides.<br />\nBarth has been criticized by some<br />\nas being too academic; Sabbatical pokes<br />\nfun at its over academic self via the inclusion of intentionally overacademic<br />\nfootnotes which make the work sound<br />\nlike a parody of its own Norton Critical Edition.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 1,4 / DECEMBER,4, 1981<br />\n<br />\nNofiteag<br />\n<br />\nMad<br />\nRiver<br />\nGlen<br />\n<br />\n669 4340<br />\n<br />\nEST 1969<br />\n<br />\n610 N.EUTAW ST.<br />\nConsistently bringing you such<br />\nfine artists as:<br />\n<br />\nGeorge Thorogood, Vacgar<br />\n<br />\nVERMONT<br />\n<br />\nClements, Dr. John, James<br />\nCotton, Jr. Walker and the<br />\n<br />\nSpecial Mid-Winter<br />\nSki Vacation Rates for<br />\nCOLLEGE STUDENTS<br />\n,day lift ticket(good Monday to FriClay)for All Lifts $44<br />\n<br />\nAllstars, The Fabulous<br />\nThunderbirds,<br />\n<br />\n$1.00<br />\nCOUPON<br />\ngood<br />\nanytime<br />\nduring<br />\nDecember<br />\nat<br />\n<br />\n-ur<br />\ntier's<br />\npace<br />\n<br />\nJohn<br />\n<br />\nHammond, Catfish Hodge,<br />\n<br />\nAvailable each Monday starting Jan 4 until Feb 1 1982<br />\nSneriat lodging arid meal packages are also available<br />\n<br />\nBuzzy Linhart,<br />\n<br />\nEllen<br />\n<br />\nMcilwisine, New Grass<br />\nRevival, Brian Bowers, J.D.<br />\n<br />\nmore information call or write<br />\n<br />\nMod<br />\nRiver<br />\nGlen<br />\n<br />\nCrowe and the New South,<br />\nPapa John Creach, Skip<br />\nCastro.<br />\n<br />\nWaitstield Vermont 05673<br />\n8021496.3551<br />\n<br />\nImmiretreitonesonsireirirren\u2022tt\u2022miii40<br />\n<br />\nLETTER PERFECT<br />\n<br />\nTo feel the magic of the music.<br />\nBring in this ad and get one<br />\ndollar off admission.<br />\n<br />\n358 - TYPE<br />\n<br />\no<br />\n<br />\nSee ad in Classifieds \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nIL_<br />\n<br />\n34th<br />\nand St. Paul<br />\nNew<br />\nFast Lunch<br />\nService<br />\n<br />\nimmbriionmoiterlion\u2022itoitoomoimuouipioF<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT<br />\nSPECIALS.<br />\nFrom Baltimore-Washington International Airport<br />\n<br />\n\"Pilot.The<br />\nhold'<br />\nonto with<br />\nIwo hands':<br />\n<br />\nLS ANGELES<br />\n<br />\n$180\"<br />\n<br />\n-Rodney Dangerfield<br />\n<br />\n\"Get your claws off my<br />\nPilot pen.

Now the real<br />\nseason starts (except for a Jan.6<br />\nmeeting with Wake Forest).<br />\nFor Virginia Tech and Virginia Commonwealth it was a<br />\nchance to fatten their records.<br />\nFor Hopkins it's an 0-2 record<br />\nand some money for the basketball program. For eleven players<br />\nwith future ambitions other than<br />\nbasketball, it was an unforgettable experience \u2014 something to<br />\ntell their grandchildren about.<br />\n<br />\nMonday night, the Virginia<br />\nTech Hokies, who play in the<br />\nMetro Conference (Louisville,<br />\nFlorida State, Memphis State,<br />\nSt. Louis, Cincinnati and<br />\nTulane), pulled out to a 43-29<br />\nlead at the half.

Virginia Tech<br />\nsenior Dale Solomon, 6'8\",<br />\ndominated, pouring in 24 points.<br />\nGordy Bryan added 19 points<br />\nfor the Hokies. For the Jays,<br />\nsophomore Michael Snider, who<br />\nplayed on the junior varsity last<br />\nyear, was a bright spot, scoring<br />\n17 points. Captain Tom Tessitore also had 17 points. Jay<br />\nforward Chris McShea, who<br />\n<br />\ninjured his ankle two weeks ago,<br />\ndid not play.<br />\nWednesday, against Virginia<br />\nCommonwealth, the Jays just<br />\nplayed poorly. They shot only<br />\n16-54\"from the field a\u2014 nd had a<br />\nwhopping 32 turnovers. Snider<br />\npaced the Jays with 10 points.<br />\nOnce again, Hopkins missed the<br />\ninside threat of McShea.<br />\nThe Jays have a chance to<br />\neven their record at 2-2 in the<br />\ncoming week, facing two Division III schools.

Strong<br />\nraces were also run for Hopkins<br />\nby Janice Brill, Jackie Chen,<br />\nKim Colfer, and Barbara<br />\nKnowlton who placed 24th,<br />\n36th, 39th, and 43rd, respectively.<br />\nActually, fewer teams and<br />\nindividuals participated in the<br />\nregional meet than at confer-<br />\n<br />\nences. This peculiarity was a<br />\nresult of the coexistence of the<br />\nNCAA and the newer AssociaIntercollegiate<br />\nfor<br />\ntion<br />\nAthletics for Women (AIAW).<br />\nMany of the MAC teams<br />\nbelong to the AIAW, which<br />\nhad its own regional championship. Also, the regional meet<br />\ntends to attract the better<br />\nteams although there are no<br />\nperformance qualifications.<br />\nMary Copeland's participation in Nationals marked the<br />\nculmination of the 1981 women's cross country season.<br />\nThe senior placed 44th out of<br />\n90 runners from across the<br />\nnation.<br />\nIn retrospect, Hopkins'<br />\nharriers had a successful season. The women participated<br />\nin seven regular season meets<br />\nand two invitationals. Finishing<br />\n2-1 against MAC teams, the<br />\nJays beat Gettysburg and<br />\nWestern Maryland.

Even<br />\nafter these losses coach Kay<br />\nFowler remains optimistic about<br />\nthe season and hopes to end it at<br />\nthe .500 mark, a big improvement over last year's dismal 3-12<br />\nrecord.<br />\nThe first game of the seasoh<br />\nwas at St. Mary's College Nov.<br />\n24, with Hopkins losing 60-51.<br />\nThe team stayed even with its<br />\nopponents until the score was<br />\n13-all, but then its offense<br />\n<br />\n/11.\u2022 Fourth and 1 To Go!<br />\nBY MICHAEL FINGERHOOD<br />\nTime out is called. Two<br />\nseconds are left in the game.<br />\nThe ball rests on the 30-yard<br />\nline, just inside the left hashmark. He wanders onto the<br />\nfield. His face shows no emotion. His teammates holler<br />\nencouragement. His team trails<br />\nby two points. The holder<br />\ncrouches at the 37-yard line. It<br />\nwill be a 47-yard attempt. He<br />\nclears away a rock from the<br />\nfield. He reties his shoelace. His<br />\nblood pressure rises. The crowd<br />\nrises. He stands a yard behind<br />\nthe holder. The wind is in his<br />\nface. The two teams line<br />\nup. The ball is snapped. It's<br />\nplaced. He boots it. The ball is<br />\nup...<br />\nThe place-kicker. Either<br />\nhe's a goat or a hero. There's<br />\nno comparable position in any<br />\nother sport. The kicker plays<br />\nabout 30 seconds a game, yet<br />\nhe's an integral part of the<br />\n<br />\nteam. His team can't win<br />\nwithout him anymore than it<br />\ncan win without its starting<br />\nquarterback.<br />\nIn a jungle of 6'4\", 250 lb.<br />\ngorillas, kickers are usually<br />\neasy to spot. They're typically<br />\n5'9\", 160 lbs., balding, bowlegged, have bad posture, and<br />\noften speak with an accent.<br />\nSometimes they can do more<br />\nthan kick, as evidenced by<br />\nEffren Herrera of the Seattle<br />\nSeahawks. Herrera has caught<br />\nthree passes out of the fake<br />\nfield goal formation in the past<br />\ntwo seasons. Occasionally,<br />\nkickers can pass too. George<br />\nBlanda played well into his<br />\nforties as a kicker and back-up<br />\nquarterback. Other kickers,<br />\nsuch as Caro Yepremian, have<br />\ntried their hand at throwing,<br />\nwith disastrous results.<br />\nKickers drive coaches<br />\ncrazy. They hit a 55-yard field<br />\ngoal and then miss an extra<br />\npoint. In addition, kickers<br />\n<br />\n. re (left) and Hakmiller battle in practice.<br />\nTessito<br />\n<br />\noften get into horrendous<br />\nslumps during which, they<br />\nclaim, it seems as if the goal<br />\nposts are six inches apart. But<br />\nthen all of a sudden, after<br />\nmissing seven straight attempts,<br />\nthey drill seven in a row. The<br />\ncrowd that once booed now<br />\ncheers.<br />\n<br />\nSometimes the ,boos can<br />\nturn to cheers on a single play.<br />\nFor instance, in Hopkins' final<br />\ngame<br />\nWestern<br />\nagainst<br />\nMaryland, Joe Nador had his<br />\nwinning field goal attempt<br />\nblocked, but still came out a<br />\nhero by falling on the ball at<br />\nthe one-yard line.<br />\nSo if you want to be a<br />\nfootball player, but you aren't<br />\nbig enough, or you are big<br />\nenough, but don't feel like<br />\nbeing crunched, be a kicker.<br />\nEither you'll be a hero who's<br />\nforgotten a week later or a goat<br />\nwho's long remembered.<br />\n<br />\nstalled for the rest of the half.<br />\nAt halftime, the score was<br />\n32-14.<br />\nThe second half was a<br />\ncompletely different story as the<br />\nteam executed its full-court<br />\npress brilliantly and created a lot<br />\nof turnovers. The Blue Jays were<br />\nable to pull within six points,<br />\nbut a three-point play by St.<br />\nMary's at the buzzer established<br />\nthe final margin.<br />\nThe loss to Gallaudet was<br />\neven more heart-breaking, as<br />\nHopkins lost in overtime by a<br />\n63-60 score. It was an extremely<br />\nclose game, with the Blue Jays<br />\nleading 25-24 at the half. Dawn<br />\nRichards tied the game at 53-all<br />\nwith a minute left in regulation<br />\ntime and the defense was able to<br />\nstop Gallaudet on its next<br />\npossession. With less than a<br />\nminute left in overtime and the<br />\nscore tied at 60-60, a Gallaudet<br />\nplayer grabbed the rebound of a<br />\nteammate's missed foul shot and<br />\nwas fouled while hitting her own<br />\nshot. After completing the threepoint play, Gallaudet was able to<br />\n<br />\nHopkins from scoring.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were once<br />\nagain victimized by fouls, as the<br />\nreferees were inconsistent in<br />\ntheir calls. Geraldine Klauber,<br />\nwith eight points and four<br />\nrebounds, fouled out of the<br />\ngame with eight minutes left in<br />\nregulation time. Sue Tyler also<br />\nhad to leave the game with four<br />\nminutes left. However, the<br />\nbench contributed a lot, as the<br />\nplay of Kim Stevens and Kathleen King allowed Hopkins to<br />\nstay in the game. In overtime<br />\nDawn Richards and Amy Buchanon both fouled out.<br />\nRichards was the high scorer<br />\nwith 23 points and had eight<br />\nBuchanon<br />\nAmy<br />\nrebounds.<br />\nto<br />\naddition<br />\nin<br />\npoints<br />\nscored 13<br />\nher team-leading 13 rebounds.<br />\nCheryl Baron played an exceptional 'all-around game, as she<br />\nscored 14 points and had seven<br />\nrebounds.

The key to its success<br />\nseems to be its ability to<br />\ncombine good, live listening<br />\nmusic with an informal conversational atmosphere. The low<br />\nbeer prices don't hurt either.<br />\n\"It's an atmosphere unmatched by a Baltimore bar,\"<br />\nsays Simball, who usually<br />\nserves as Chester's sound engineer. \"You don't have to worry<br />\nabout a beer getting spilled<br />\nover your head, unless your<br />\nbuddy did it. It's laid back and<br />\nit's cheap.\"<br />\nAnd perhaps the most<br />\n.interesting aspect of Chester's<br /><br />\nplace is its people: the crowa,<br />\nwhether you call it \"anachronistic\" or ;ust plain different, is<br />\nfull of people that one either<br />\nnever sees together in the same<br />\nroom at Hopkins, or doesn't<br />\nusually see at all.<br />\n\"I like to-think of this as a<br /><br />\nboheme music hangout,\" Simball says. \"A lot of old friends<br />\ncome to see each other at<br />\nChester's, and a lot of people<br />\ncome to meet new people. It's<br />\ngreat for that.\"<br />\n.<br />\nDave Fishkin, Chester's<br />\nother director and its original<br /><br />\nfounder back in 1977, describes it in slightly more<br />\nmetaphysical terms:<br />\n\"We have a philosophy<br />\nhere of the so-called `Zumebuze' (zim-boo-zee) people,\"<br />\nhe says with a straight face.<br />\ncont. on p. 7<br /><br />\nRatLosesBusiness To VillagePub<br />\nBY MARTIN CARLSON<br />\nThe new competition from<br />\nthe Charles Village Pub (CVP)<br />\non St. Paul Street has hurt the<br />\nRat. According to workers at<br />\nthe Rat, since the bar opened<br />\nlast spring, the Rat has suffered<br />\na decrease in attendance.<br />\nNeal Blaxburg; a senior in<br />\ncharge of contracting bands for<br />\nthe Rat, stated that CVP<br />\nattracts students because it<br />\nserves liquor and sponsors<br />\nfrequent specials.

Pat<br />\nHiggins, a senior employed by<br />\nARA to work in the Rat, said,<br />\n\"I've been working at the door<br />\nwhen people come in, see that<br />\nwe charge $1.50, then turn<br />\naround and leave.\" He added,<br /><br />\n\"I question why they bring in<br />\nbands and charge that much.\"<br />\nBlaxburg said that the<br />\nadmission fee is not too steep<br />\nwhen one considers the high<br />\nquality of the bands that<br />\nperform. He admitted, however, \"I made a critical error<br />\nwhen I assumed people were<br />\ncoming for entertainment -people come to the Rat to see<br />\nother people.\"<br />\nHiggins also pointed out<br />\nthat cheap beer is no longer<br /><br />\navailable in the Rat. During his<br />\nthree years of working on<br />\nweekends, the price of beer has<br />\nmore than doubled. Blaxburg<br />\nadded that the Rat cannot<br />\ncompete with fraternity parties<br />\nand other social functions that<br />\nfeature free or cheap beer. He<br />\nsaid that in spite of the Rat's<br />\ncommendable showing last<br />\nyear, it lost money, so the<br />\nmanagement felt compelled to<br />\nraise beer prices.<br />\ncont. on p. 7<br /><br />\nThe Charles Village Pub presents serious competition for the Rat.<br /><br />\nrescind its original ban on rock<br />\nmusic but did<br />\nnot adopt<br />\nFishkin's proposal.<br />\nFishkin contended that the<br />\nStudent Council refused to acknowledge any other solutions,<br />\nincluding his own, at the meeting where the original ban was<br />\nbeing reconsidered. \"The Student Council compromise is no<br />\ncompromise at all. Too much<br />\nmusic has still been cut from the<br />\nFair.\"<br />\nIn Fishkin's proposal, he<br />\nsaid, \"Because music has played<br />\na vital and essential role in the<br />\nSpring Fair..., and security concerns can. be met without<br />\nreducing the music, the type and<br />\namount of music should not be<br />\naltered.\"<br />\nIn a report issued by the<br />\nSpring Fair Ad Hoc Committee,<br />\nthe SC said the upper quad had<br />\nhistorically been \"the more<br />\ntroublesome spot during the<br />\nFair.\" Fishkin can not see why,<br />\nif this report is accurate, more<br />\nsecurity was not posted in the<br />\nupper quad last year. In fact, he<br />\nnoted, \"No security officer was<br />\nposted at the Gilman stage last<br />\nyear.\" Fishkin feels that by<br />\nincreasing security at each music<br />\nstage, future incidents can be<br />\nprevented.<br />\nFishkin also contended that<br />\nthere was too little information<br />\nupon which the security concerns were based. Fishkin explained, \"No account has been<br />\ngiven in the Ad Hoc Committee's report of any incidents<br />\noccurring last year.\" Thus, he<br />\nconcludes, \"In the absence of<br />\nany facts which show that the<br />\nmusic poses a threat to security,<br />\nits role in the Fair ought to be<br />\ntotally preserved.\"<br />\nBased on these points, Fishkin made several recomMendacont. on p. 3<br /><br />\nPAGE 2 / DECEMBER 4, 1981<br /><br />\nCommunity News<br />\nBY KIM SHEARIN<br /><br />\nRally To DefendPoliticalFreedom<br />\nThe Political Rights Defense Fund, which is handling the<br />\nlegal and fundraising aspects of cases filed against the government by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) and the Young<br />\nSocialist Alliance (YSA), will sponsor a \"Rally to Defend Political<br />\nFreedom\" Sunday, Dec. 6 at 7:30 p.m. The rally will take place<br />\nat St. John's United Methodist Church, located at the corner of<br />\n27th and St. Paul streets.

A student who<br />\ntakes sufficient time to analyze<br />\nthe concepts which he is being<br />\nspoon-fed will soon find himself<br />\nfar behind and failing the course.<br />\nPerhaps at upper levels, classes in.<br />\npolitical economy encourage criticism of its principles, but on<br />\nthe introductory level it is nearly<br />\nimpossible. The critical mind<br />\nsoon finds itself confronted<br />\nwith graphs and charts which<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nAre They Really Listening?<br />\nFirst: Congratulations to all parties.<br />\ninvolved for arriving at what seems to be<br />\nnot only a fair compromise, but ultimately<br />\nthe best way of instituting plus/minus<br />\ngrading. Having the new system take effect<br />\nstarting with next year's freshmen should<br />\neliminate the potential for contradiction in<br />\nand subsequent misreading of student<br />\ntranscripts. The grade system itself, as<br />\nargued earlier here, will provide a more<br />\naccurate measure of performance at an<br />\ninstitution which is by nature competitive<br />\nand goal-oriented.<br />\nSpecial praise is due the Student<br />\nCouncil and its Education Committee for<br />\nso vigorously sounding student opinion of<br />\nthe originally proposed across-the-board<br />\nimplementation of plue/minus grading, and<br />\nfor representing that opinion to the Academic Council. The Academic Council, in<br />\nturn, should be commended for being, in<br />\nthe end, properly sensitive to student<br />\nwishes on this issue.<br />\nBut: There is one aspect of this<br />\nhappy conclusion which merits some<br />\nthought before it is tucked away and<br />\nforgotten, namely Dean Owen's statement<br />\nthat \"This decision shows that we listen to<br />\nthe students.\" A proper response to that<br />\nstatement is, \"Well, yes and no.\" First of<br />\nall, \"we\" means different people in different situations. The faculty and the administration are by no means such a unified<br /><br />\nentity that any student should make the<br />\nmistake of thinking of them as \"we.\" Until<br />\nnow, perceiving its unpopularity with the<br />\nstudents, administration members have<br />\nmade a visible effort to disassociate themselves with the faculty on the matter of.<br />\nplus/minus grading, calling themselves<br />\npowerless in the matter.<br />\nMore important, however, there are<br />\nother issues, as yet unresolved, where it is<br />\nby no means clear that students are being<br />\nlistened to. The decision to ban rock music<br />\nfrom Spring Fair, though it was officially<br />\nmade by the Student Council, was reached<br />\nlong ago by the administration. The way in<br />\nwhich the ban has been rescinded represents a placating gesture more than anything else; it would be interesting to see<br />\nwhat would happen if the Student Council<br />\nvoted to rescind the ban entirely. It is<br />\ndoubtful whether the autonomy the SC<br />\nseemed to enjoy in enacting the ban would<br />\nstill go unchallenged \u2014 the point being that<br />\nthe administration wants no music at the<br />\nFair, and that, for the most part, is how it's<br />\ngoing to be. No serious compromise \u2014<br />\nsuch as the one presented by David Fishkin<br />\n(see story, page 1) \u2014 would be seriously<br />\nentertained by the administration.<br />\nSo: This issue of plus/minus grading<br />\nhas a happy ending, and let's keep our eyes<br />\non the next one.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\nEthics Board<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nand is presided over by the<br />\npresiding official of the Ethics<br />\nBoard.

The facts, of course,<br />\ncannot be questioned.<br />\nHodding Carter III, former<br />\nspokesman for the State Department, gave this year's George<br />\nHuntington Williams Lecture<br />\nTuesday night in Shriver Hall.<br />\nCarter, who was a journalist for<br />\n18 years before serving in the<br />\nCarter Administration, gave a<br />\ncritical analysis of the mass<br />\nmedia in the U.S. today and how<br />\nit provides information to the<br />\npublic.<br />\nAlthough the media does<br />\nnot intentionally mislead the<br />\npublic, Carter alleges that much<br />\nof what one reads in the newspapers or watches on TV is<br />\nbiased and misleading. Carter<br />\nsaid that of approximately 6,000<br />\narticles he wrote as a reporter<br />\nand writer for the Delta Democratic-Times in Greenville, Miss.,<br />\none third were wrong, another<br />\nthird inadvertently misled the<br />\npublic and only about 10<br />\npercent were relevant to the<br />\nfuture. Carter warned that the<br />\nlay media observer should not<br />\n\"mistake the absence of lying<br />\nfor the presence of truth.\"<br />\nHaving worked as both a<br />\njournalist and a spokesman to<br />\nthe press, Carter, currently a<br />\npress critic for the public television series Inside Story,<br />\nencourages the public to be<br />\nskeptical of the printed word<br />\nand maintains that one cannot<br />\nexpect to get all the facts on a<br />\nparticular issue from a single<br />\npublication. He believes that the<br /><br />\n\"Love Hurts\"<br />\nthiELL,S490CAAJer<br />\nSuRE SHE DoEstv'T<br />\n(.4.491vr it&amp; FoR 4tuR<br />\nGo0 Y<br /><br />\npress \"does not deliver news in<br />\nsufficient detail and context\" to<br />\ninform fully citizens of a democratic nation.<br />\nContrary to public opinion,<br />\nCarter said, cover-ups and criminal activities are rarely the<br />\nreason for withholding information from the press. Usually, the<br />\nparty concerned does not provide information to the press<br />\neither because it feels that the<br />\npublic will not comprehend the<br />\nsituation or is concerned that<br />\npremature disclosure will distort<br />\nthe events and promote inquiries.<br />\nFor these reasons, the public often receives brief flashes of<br />\nnews once the situation has been<br />\nresolved and no public participation in decision making is<br />\npossible. Citing the aborted<br />\nattempt to rescue the American<br />\nhostages in Iran, Carter said that<br />\nsometimes members of the State<br />\nDepartment are also kept in the<br />\ndark, as well as the press.<br />\nCarter also pointed to the<br />\nprocess of information dissemination as a contributing factor in<br />\ndistorting news items. \"You<br />\ncan't tell it in 90 seconds,\" said<br />\nCarter to emphasize that a<br />\ntelevision news broadcast provides too little time to get an<br />\naccurate picture of the issue<br />\n,Lcross. The viewer, therefore, is<br />\nblasted with bits of news that<br />\nlack a past setting, a future<br />\ncontext or any sort of continuity. Newspapers similarly try to<br />\nprovide information in \"explosive stabs\" by concentrating an<br />\nentire story into a lead ,or an<br />\neye-catching headline.<br />\ncont. on p. 9<br /><br />\nBy Cliff Harris<br />\n1<br /><br />\nBy Jim Gilligan<br />\nITS FROM THE E NEm y<br />\nSIR THEYcoANTmoNTH-LO N5<br />\ncEAsEFIRE_<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\n\\\\\\\\<br /><br />\nPAGE. 6 / DECEMBER 4, 1981<br />\nV Ile1111<br />\n1UlMr\u00b0II 1111V MP1r%VWIMP WS,<br />\n111\"/VIVIVliriN\"JV,<br />\nair<br />\n41111.46dideoa*air die Mini&amp;<br />\nMI &amp;N.i3&amp;1&amp;iKpas%Uhl&amp;<br /><br />\nords<br /><br />\nTino's Lunch<br />\nNEW:'.<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nIndian Spices<br />\n&amp; Groceries<br /><br />\nrocessing<br /><br />\nt4<br />\nt:1 Fried Chicken<br />\nful<br /><br />\nubs<br /><br />\nDrinks<br /><br />\nVegetarian &amp;<br />\nNton-vegetarian<br />\nFoods<br />\n5511 York Road\u20223234440<br /><br />\ntyping services<br />\nword processing<br /><br />\nTony Sorrenti<br /><br />\nLunch. 11:30-2:30<br />\n\u00b0inner: 530-10:30<br /><br />\nbeef, Barbecve<br />\nFries<br /><br />\n1:4<br /><br />\n11<br />\n84<br />\nIt<br /><br />\nti<br />\n245 Northeast Market<br />\nt<br />\n14 Monument and Chester Streets<br />\nta<br />\n732-6733<br />\nEzumErari.nizirzuz=zzi<br />\nezu..44<br />\npirI<br /><br />\nFall Exam Schedule<br />\nMilton S.

We try to<br />\nhave different purposes coming<br />\ntogether which promote mutual<br />\ngrowth \u2014 like raising money for<br />\nthe tutoring program (the tutoring program sponsored by Chaplain Chester Wickwire, from<br />\nwhom Chester's Place takes<br />\nits name), while providing a<br />\nforum for musical expression,<br />\nand a place for people to meet<br />\nand talk. The combination is<br />\nultimate growth.\"<br />\nUltimate growth or not,<br />\nChester's couldn't draw its<br />\ncrowds without good music. The<br />\nperformers are divided evenly<br />\nbetween students who have<br />\nmanaged to work up an act and<br />\noutside musicians. The quality,<br />\nespecially in light of the fact<br />\nthat Chester's does not pay or<br />\naudition its acts, is high.<br />\n\"Our acts range from the<br />\nridiculous to the sublime, with<br />\nmost falling pretty squarely in<br />\nbetween,\" Simball says.\"On the<br />\nwhole, we've had more superexcellents than total flops, and<br />\nnobody ever gets booed off stage<br />\nhere. We always have three acts<br />\nin an evening, so if the first act is<br />\nbad, people relax and talk and<br />\nwait for the next one. It's a<br />\nnon-paying audience, so they<br />\ntend to be pretty friendly.\"<br /><br />\nThe<br /><br />\nfriendly<br /><br />\naudiences,<br /><br />\nSimball says, are the incentive<br />\nfor both professional outside<br />\nmusicians and first-time student<br />\nacts.<br />\n\"The students, who may<br />\nnot have had much time to<br />\npractice can feel safe getting b.<br />\nchance to play for an audience<br />\nhere,\" he says. \"The professionals can relax and have a good<br />\ntime, and a lot of them start<br />\ndeveloping a following at<br />\nChester's that will come to see<br />\nthem at other places. We're<br />\nalways booked up a month in<br />\nadvance, so they must get<br />\nsomething out of it.\"<br />\nGroups that have gotten<br />\nstarted through Chester's Place<br />\ninclude Poetic Justice (formerly<br />\nNo Mercy, and begun by thenHopkins student Ned Solomon);<br />\nthe Charm City Reactors, who<br />\nhad their first gig there; and<br />\nguitarist Howard Markman,<br />\nformerly with the group Freewater.<br />\n\"It's a good place for<br />\nmusicians to meet each other,\"<br />\nSimball says. \"It's easy to go up<br />\nto the performers here and talk<br />\nto them,, whereas it can be<br />\npretty intimidating in a club.\"<br />\nSimball, who is a 23-yearold medical student at Hopkins,<br />\nand Fishkin, a '81 graduate of<br />\nthe University of Maryland Law<br />\nSchool, have been successful this<br />\nyear in extending the music<br />\nof Chester's Place to other nights<br />\nand other locations. They have<br />\nsponsored four Saturday night<br />\nconcerts in the Great Hall in<br />\nLevering, and helped a freshman<br /><br />\nin his efforts to open up<br />\nChester's Place on another night.<br />\nIn addition, they have brought<br />\nin poetry readings, puppet<br />\nshows, and political speakers.<br />\n\"We try to have mindexpanding things, to present<br />\nwhat's going on on the other<br />\nside of the six o'clock news,\"<br />\nSimball says. \"It can be hard to<br />\ndo at Hopkins, where people are<br />\nout to conquer the world and<br />\ndon't have time for this stuff.<br />\nHopkins has a real problem<br />\ndealing with the outside world.<br />\nThere could be a lot more<br />\nentertainment at this campus,<br />\nbut there's an attitude that the<br />\nthings that happen here should<br /><br />\nbe for the students only, and<br />\nthe community mustn't be let in<br />\n\u2014 I think that's what is behind<br />\nthe Student Council's decision<br />\nto ban rock music from the<br />\nSpring Fair. They're crawling<br />\nback into their shell.\"<br />\nIt's been a good year for<br />\nChester's Place in many respects,<br />\nbut one major problem faces it<br />\nin the future: both Simball and<br />\nFishkin may be partially or<br />\ncompletely unavailable after this<br />\nsummer. Simball will be on<br />\nmedical call, and Fishkin may be<br />\nleaving Baltimore.<br />\n\"Somebody new has to<br />\ncome along and give this place<br />\npriority for existing,\" Fishkin<br /><br />\nsays, and Simball adds, \"It<br />\nwould be a real crime to let this<br />\nplace fade away because there<br />\nwas no one to run it, when there<br />\nis certainly no lack of people<br />\nwho want to come. We always<br />\nhave good crowds here, even in<br />\nthe summer.\"<br />\nBoth Simball and Fishkin,<br />\nas well as the part-time workers<br />\nwho help them out, work on a<br />\nstrictly volunteer basis \u2014 in fact,<br />\nthey don't even get free beer.<br />\nFishkin says the job demands<br />\nup to about seven hours a week,<br />\nmost of it falling on Wednesday<br />\nnights, and essentially consists of<br />\nordering and selling beer, setting<br />\nup the stage, and cleaning up.<br /><br />\nDeclining Attendance Forces<br />\nRat Entertainment Changes<br />\ncont. from p.<br />\nBrian O'Leary, another<br />\nsenior employee of ARA, said<br />\n\"tight management\" during the<br />\nopening weeks of school turned<br />\npeople away from the Rat. The<br />\nfirst Thursday the employees<br />\ndenied people entrance because<br />\nof the fire hazard. \"The management,\" he pointed out,<br />\n\"could have explained the reasons for not allowing the people<br />\nin the door.\" Blaxburg did not<br />\nblame the management, but<br />\nadmitted, \"A lot of things<br />\nthat went wrong the first couple<br />\nof weeks led to the decline of<br />\nthe Rat.\"<br />\nHiggins said that those in<br /><br />\ncharge at the Rat have not<br />\nadvertised sufficiently, especially<br />\nin the News-Letter. Blaxburg<br />\nagreed and blamed ARA for<br />\nfailing to promote its beer<br />\nspecials.

The<br />\nEthics Board will make this<br />\nrecommendation to the Committee of Undergraduate Studies, of which it is a subcommittee.<br />\nThough the Ethics Board<br />\nwould require professors to<br />\ndistribute the blue books, the<br />\nBoard would not decide whether students must sign the<br />\nstatement of academic integ-<br /><br />\nrity. Professors may require<br />\nstudents to do so, however.<br />\nKathleen Connally, chairman of the Ethics Board, says<br />\nit is likely that the University<br />\nwould provide the blue books<br />\n\"at no cost to the departments.\"<br />\nThe blue books would be<br />\ncoded to prevent students from<br />\nduplicating them.<br />\nOne of the purposes of the<br />\nnew blue books, according to<br />\nConnally, would be to make<br />\nstudents aware of the Ethics<br />\nCode. The Ethics Board believes this would \"make them<br />\nthink before cheating,\" said<br />\nConnally.<br />\nBecause professors would<br />\ndistribute the blue books at the<br />\nbeginning of exams, students<br />\nwould be unable to hide crib<br /><br />\nnotes in them.<br />\nThe Ethics Board will not<br />\nrequire students to sign the<br />\nacademic integrity statement<br />\nprinted on the front of the<br />\nblue books because \"some<br />\nstudents feel this is putting<br />\nthem down,\" said Connally.<br />\nA student's signature on<br />\nthe academic integrity statement would not make prosecution on a charge of cheating<br />\neasier, Connally says. \"We are<br />\nonly trying to raise student<br />\nconsciousness. It doesn't hurt<br />\nthe student at all,\" she emphasized.<br />\nLast spring, the Ethics<br />\nBoard suggested to professors<br />\nthat they include the statement<br />\nof academic integrity on<br />\nexams. So far, according to<br />\nConnally, only about a quarter<br /><br />\nhave done so. The Ethics<br />\nBoard hopes to have more<br />\ncooperation by providing free<br />\nblue books already printed<br />\nwith the statement.<br />\nThe Ethics Board is also<br />\nwaiting for the Academic<br />\nCouncil to consider several<br />\namendments to its constitution. The Student Council has<br />\nalready passed these amendments.<br />\nThe major change in the<br />\nconstitution would be to allow<br />\na professor and a student<br />\naccused of cheating to settle<br />\nthe case without a hearing<br />\nbefore a panel of the Ethics<br />\nBoard. To settle without a<br />\nhearing, the student would<br />\nhave to admit to guilt and sign<br />\na letter saying so.<br />\nThe present constitution<br /><br />\nFish wrap Media<br />\ncont. from p. 5<br />\nAnother reason that the<br />\npress does not adequately inform the people, according to<br />\nCarter, is thlt it tries to please a<br />\npublic that does not know what<br />\nit wants by giving it what it<br />\nthinks it wants. In working for a<br />\nsmall-town paper, Carter learned<br />\nthat according to the polls, the<br />\npeople of the area were not<br />\nconcerned about foreign policy;<br />\nthey wanted to read more local<br />\nnews. Rather than appeasing<br />\nthe public and devoting the<br />\npaper to local news, Carter feels<br /><br />\ndoes not allow cases of cheating to be settled without a<br />\nhearing, but, according to<br />\nConnally, they often are because some professors believe<br />\n\"a hearing is too much trouble<br />\nor will not be fair.\" The<br />\namended constitution \"will be<br />\nmore compatible with the way<br />\nthings are,\" said Connally.<br />\nThe Ethics Board would<br />\nrequire professors to report all<br />\ncases of cheating even if they<br />\nare settled without hearings.<br />\nThis would allow the Board to<br />\nnotify students who have admitted to guilt of all the<br />\nconsequences they may face.<br />\nThe Ethics Board would<br />\nalso enter the name of any<br />\nstudent who has admitted to<br />\nguilt on a list it keeps of all<br />\nstudents found guilty.<br /><br />\nWook$<br /><br />\nit is the journalist's duty to<br />\npresent the issues that concern<br />\nthe reader, including foreign<br />\npolicy, in a manner in which the<br />\nreader can understand them.<br /><br />\ncont. from p. 5<br />\ntheories that his ability to see<br />\nwhether these theories fairly<br />\nI represent truth will be virtually<br />\ndestroyed.<br /><br />\nFinally, Carter encouraged<br />\nthe public to provide constructive criticism to the press in an<br />\nattempt to coax the professionals in the media industry, whom<br />\nhe feels are quite capable, to<br />\nprovide information that is complete and relevant.<br /><br />\nThat the Political Economy<br />\nDepartment just about refuses to<br />\nteach the Marxist viewpoint tells<br />\nthe astute viewer .that this<br />\ndepartment is not concerned<br />\nwith seeking truth, but rather<br />\nwith reproducting its own notions, however fallacious they<br />\nmay be.<br /><br />\nLunch Special<br />\nFree Soup with any sub<br />\nFree draft beer and salad with<br />\nany dinnerfrom 11:00-3:00<br />\nTry our daily lunch and dinner<br />\nspecials.<br />\nSome of our specialties are:<br />\nVeal Platters<br />\nShishkabob<br />\nLarge Greek Salad<br />\nPizza<br /><br />\nrRallis Restaurant<br />\n2025 East Monument St.<br />\n732-8570<br /><br />\nSports Medicine<br />\nA talk by<br /><br />\nDr. William Howard<br /><br />\nDirector of Sports Medicine,<br />\nUnion Memorial Hospital<br />\nWednesday,December9<br />\n7:00 pm L-V Room<br /><br />\nSponsored by AED<br /><br />\nThe Assassination ofJohn<br />\nEDITOR'S NOTE:<br />\nThe News-Letter emphasizes that Livingstone's<br />\nstatus as an investigator is unofficial. The ideas presented here are his own, based on conversations he conducted,and may or may not hold some of the answers<br />\nto this much-obscured case. What is most important is<br />\nthat the contradictions in the Warren Commission's<br />\nreport be recognized, and that people continue to ask<br />\nquestions.<br /><br />\nby Robin<br />\nJohnson<br />\nWhat really happened in Dallas, November 22,<br />\n1963, on the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated?<br />\nWe may never know; as times has passed the event has<br />\nbecome cloudier rather than clearer, investigations have<br />\nmuddled existing facts rather than uncovering new<br />\nones.<br /><br />\nHarrison Edward Livingstone<br />\nMany individuals have dedicated themselves to<br />\ntrying to discern the facts involved. Many theories have<br />\nbeen offered, different motives discussed, various<br />\nconspirators named, but the underlying revelation of<br />\nthe opposing facts and fantasies is that the Warren<br />\nCommission report is grossly inaccurate, some would<br />\nsay, to the point of fabrication.<br />\nOne such person, who does not believe the Warren<br />\nCommission's report and who is working to uncover<br />\nthe, truth about the event, is Harrison Livingstone.<br />\nLivingstone is a Harvard graduate with a law degree. He<br />\nhas taught creative writing at Harvard and is now a<br />\nnovelist, poet and playwright.<br />\n\"I am primarily an artist,\" said Livingstone.<br />\n\"Kennedy was like a breath of fresh air that stimulated<br />\nthe performing arts and gave great hope to all writers.\"<br />\nLivingstone recently gave a lecture on the Homewood campus about his discoveries in the Kennedy<br />\ncase. The News-Letter has since spoken with Livingstone in order to present a fuller account of the<br />\ndevelopments in the Kennedy assassination case as<br />\nposited by Livingstone and other unofficial investigators with whom he has come in contact (although he<br />\nworks alone) in his pursuit of the truth. Livingstone<br />\ndiscussed some.of the more widely accepted theories,<br />\nhis own beliefs as to who was involved in the assassination and why, and then gave a document of statements<br />\nfrom the doctors and nurses who first worked on the<br />\nbody. This document is the result of Livingstone's own<br />\nresearch and questioning of these medical personnel in<br />\nthe past two and a half years.<br /><br />\nTHEMAGIC<br />\nBULLET THEORYThe Warren Commission maintains that Lee<br />\nHarvey Oswald acted alone and fired three shots at<br />\nKennedy from the sixth floor of a building behind<br />\nKennedy's limousine. Livingstone, agreeing with other<br />\nassassination experts, believes that there were at least<br />\nsix, and possibly seven, shots fired in all. This fact has<br />\nbeen ascertained from sound recordings of the<br /><br />\nNew Testimony as reported<br />\nDallas, Texas \u2014 More than a dozen doctors and nurses who either treated former President John F. Kennedy<br />\nduring his final hours or participated in the autopsy of the slain president have recently stated that the official<br />\nautopsy photographs of the back of Kennedy's head do not show the same gunshot wounds which they saw and<br />\nreported to the Warren Commission in 1963-64.<br />\nThe autopsy photos, which were among many items of evidence in the assassination kept secret by the Warren<br />\nCommission, were never officially shown to the Dallas medical witnesses during the various investigations into the<br />\nkilling. After looking at them for the first time recently, however, nearly all of the nurses and doctors involved in<br />\nthe shooting said that the pictures do not show the wounds as they actually were.<br />\nThe testimony of these witnesses, which was assembled recently in a series of tape recorded interviews in<br />\nDallas and several other cities, presents the most significant challenge to the official explanations of the assassination to date.<br />\nAmong other things, the startling testimony indicates that members of the Warren Commission covered up<br />\ninformation about the 1963 murder; that there were three or more gunmen on the scene; that the president was<br />\nshot from in front, as well as from behind, in a well-planned ambush which was the result of a broad conspiracy.<br />\n\"That's not the way I remember it,\" said Dr. Richard Dulany, a medical resident who was on duty in the<br />\nemergency room when Kennedy was brought in, later looking at a copy of an official autopsy photograph. According to Dr. Dulany, there is a \"definite conflict\" between the wounds as portrayed in the photo and the wounds<br />\nwhich he observed in the emergency room.<br />\nThere were at least 22 witnesses in Dallas who have described a \"large hole in the back of the head.\" Dr.<br />\nDulany insists that the photo does not show the large, gaping wound which had blown out the back of the president's head.<br />\nDr. Paul Peters, professor and chairman of the Urology Department at the University of Texas Southwestern<br />\nMedical School at Parkland, also questions the accuracy of the disputed photograph. Dr. Peters told the Warren<br />\nCommission: \"We saw the wound of entry in the throat and noted the large occipital wound.\" After seeing the<br />\npictures, he said, \"I don't think it's consistent with what I saw. There was a large hole in the back of the head<br />\nthrough which one could see the brain. But that hole does not appear in the photograph.\"<br />\n(The President's widow also described a severe wound at the back of the head to the Commission: \"But from<br />\nthe back, you could see, you know, you were trying to hold his hair and his skull on...\"<br />\nDoris Nelson, a Dallas nurse who was the supervisor of the emergency room when Kennedy was brought there,<br />\nand who helped to treat the dying President said that government autopsy photos of the skull are \"not true.\"<br />\n\"There was no hair,\" she said, while disputing the most controversial photograph, which barely shows a small entry<br />\nwound in the cowlick area, which is four inches from where the autopsy report, itself, describes it. \"Thele wasn't<br />\neven any hair back there [on the back of the head]. It was blown out.\"<br />\nThe positions of the head wounds are crucial in determining the direction from which the various shots which<br />\nstruck Kennedy were fired. A large, gaping wound at the back of the skull, for example, would indicate that a<br />\nbullet had exited there after entering the front of the head. In addition, it would directly contradict the findings of<br />\nthe Warren Commission, which concluded that the president had been shot only twice,from behind.<br />\nThe descriptions of a gaping-wound at the back of the skull also point up a major conflict between the findings<br />\nof the Warren Commission and the testimony which it took from the President's window, Secret Servicemen,<br />\nDallas medical witnesses and the autopsists \u2014 all of whom at that time described a large exit wound at the back of<br />\nthe head.<br />\nUntil recently, autopsy photographs of the President's shattered skull had been withheld from both the<br />\nwitnesses and the public by a Warren Commission edict which prohibited the release of many items of evidence<br />\nuntil 2039.<br />\nBut that changed during the recent House Select Committee on Assassinations hearings on the case, when,<br />\nafter a burglary of the Committee's safe, the autopsy photos were removed. After news of the burglary broke,<br />\nabout a year after, the Committee was forced to publish copies of the key pictures \u2014 those showing the back, neck<br />\nand head of the murdered president.<br />\nClaiming that the photographs were too \"gory,\"<br />\nhowever, the Committee actually published exact<br />\ntracings of them. It was these tracings, which are<br />\ndescribed as being accurate down to the last detail,<br />\nwhich the Dallas medical witnesses recently evaluated<br />\nfor this report. (One witness, however, Dr. Malcolm<br />\nPerry of the Cornell Medical Center, was shown prints<br />\nof the actual photographs by Sun reporters in 1979,<br />\nand also strongly denounced them as being inaccurate.)<br />\nIf the medical witnesses who have disputed the<br />\naccuracy of the photographs are correct, the authenticity of the pictures becomes highly suspect and the<br />\npossibility emerges that the pictures \u2014 along with other<br />\nevidence \u2014 may have been forged. If so, a key to<br />\nuncovering the identity of those behind the conspiracy<br />\nmay lie in determining who possessed the ability and<br />\naccess which would have been needed to fabricate the<br />\nClose-up photograph of the posterior head wound<br />\nevidence.<br />\nThe list of medical witnesses who have challenged the autopsy photos includes Dr. Robert McClelland, professor of surgery at the University of Texas Medical School in Dallas. Seventeen years ago, he told the Warren Commission that he stood at the head of the operating table in the emergency room in \"...Such a position that I could<br />\nvery closely examine the head wound, and I noted that the right posterior portion of the skull had been extremely<br />\nblasted. It had been shattered, apparently, by the force of the shot. . .in such a way that you could actually look<br />\ndown into the skull cavity.\"<br />\nRecently, after viewing a sketch of the gaping head wound which had been shown by an independent investigator, Dr. McClelland said that it accurately portrays what he \"vividly remembers\" seeing on the operating table<br />\nafter the President was rushed into emergency. He firmly rejected the autopsy photos.<br />\nMargaret Hood (Margaret Henchliffe at the time) had been an emergency room nurse for 12 years prior to the<br />\nassassination. The nurse, who helped wheel the wounded President into the room and later prepared his body for<br />\nthe coffin, recently drew a sketch of the wound on a skull model provided by reporters. That sketch also showed a<br />\nlarge wound at the back of the head. \"You couldn't see much of the wound,\" said Ms. Hood.\"It didn't affect his<br />\nface or ears at all. . .it was more to the back.\" Ms. Hood also strongly disavowed the photographs.<br />\nIN. Ronald C. Jones, a professor of surgery who was Parkland Hospital's chief resident in surgery at the time<br />\nof the murder, originally described for the Warren Commission \". . .what appeared to be an exit wound in the<br />\nposterior portion of the skull.\" He also rejected the autopsy photos, and drew an outline with his finger of a large<br />\nhole.at the back of an imaginary head. In addition, he described the drawing which Dr. McClelland had approved as<br />\n\"close.\"<br /><br />\nI Kennedy:New Evidence<br />\nd by Harrison Livingstone<br />\nPatricia Gustafson (then Patricia Hutton), another<br />\nemergency room nurse at the time of the shooting,<br />\nhelped to wheel the president from the limousine into<br />\ntreatment. Ms. Gustafson, testifying before the Warren<br />\nCommission, outlined a \". . .massive opening on the<br />\nback of the head.\" Recently, describing an effort to<br />\nplace a pressure bandage on the head wound,she said:<br />\n\"I tried to do so, but there was really nothing to put a<br />\npressure bandage on. It was too massive. So he told me<br />\njust to leave it be.\" Asked if she was sure about the<br />\nlocation of the wound, she said yes: \"It was the back<br />\nof the head,\" she said, while rejecting the autopsy<br />\nphotos.<br />\nDr. Fouad Bashour was an associate professor of<br />\nmedicine in cardiology at the time of the shooting. Interviewed by this reporter at his office in 1979, Dr.<br />\nBashour insisted that .the official photo whiCh he was<br />\nbeing shown did not accurately depict the location of<br />\nthe major wound. \"Why do they cover it up?\" he asked<br />\nseveral times. \"This is not the way it was.\"<br />\nDr. Charles Baxter, interviewed the same day, who<br />\nhad earlier told the Warren Commission, \"There was a<br />\nlarge, gaping wound in the back of the skull,\" also questioned the autopsy photos.<br />\nAfter being shown the most controversial photo, Dr.<br />\nMarion Jenkins, who told the Warren Commission,\"There<br />\nwas a great laceration on the right side of the head (temDrawing depicting the posterior head wound<br />\nporal and occipital)...even to the extent that the cerebelthat, because. ..No, you want to know<br />\nlum had protruded from the wound,\" blurted: \"No, not like that. Not like<br />\nback.\"<br />\nwhat it really looked like? Well, that picture doesn't look like it from the<br />\nDr. Jenkins demonstrated several times, by touching his own and a reporter's head, that the large exit wound<br />\nhad been located on the back of the skull: \"You could tell at this point with your fingers that it was scored out,<br />\nthat the edges were blasted out.\"<br />\nDr. Charles J. Carrico, now a professor of surgery at the University of Washington in Seattle, was a general<br />\nsurgeon in residency at Parkland when the president was shot \u2014 and the first doctor to reach him. He told the<br />\nWarren Commission about a large gaping wound, a five-by-seven centimeter defect in the posterior skull, which he<br />\nobserved in the occipital region. But he has not been interviewed since.<br />\nIn addition to these medical figures, three other physicians who were involved in treating the stricken president \u2014 Doctors Gene C. Akin, Jackie Hunt and Adolph Giesecke, Jr. \u2014 have not fully endorsed the autopsy pictures.<br />\nTwo crucial medical witnesses, meanwhile, have not yet been interviewed,about the case. Dr. Kemp Clark, who<br />\nwas the senior physician on duty in the Parkland \"trauma room\" when the wounded president was brought in,<br />\nrefuses to comment \u2014 although he described for the Warren Commi\u00a7sion a \".. .a laLge wound in the right occiput,<br />\nextending into the parietal region.\" Diana H. Bowron, a British nurse who worked in the Parkland emergency room<br />\nin 1963, could not be located as of this writing. However, Ms. Bowron did tell the Warren Commission: \"The<br />\nPresident was moribund. He was lying across Mrs. Kennedy's knee, and there seemed to be blood everywhere.<br />\nWhen I went around to the other side of the car, I saw the condition of his head.. .the back of his head. . .it was<br />\nvery bad;I just saw one large hole.\"<br />\nOther inconsistencies between the official inquiries into the shooting and the recent Comments by medical<br />\nwitnesses include:<br />\n\u2014 The official Dallas death certificate describes the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the left temple.<br />\n\u2014 According to the recently interviewed medical witnesses, the,President had been shot in the throat, from in<br />\nfront, in addition to the head-shot.<br />\n\u2014 The autopsists, themselves, insisted that the autopsy photographs did not portray an entry wound at the<br />\nback of the head, where they noted it. As an appendix to the House Assassinations Committee report stated: \"The<br />\npanel continued to be concerned about the persistent disparity between its findings and those of the autopsy<br />\npathologists and the rigid tenacity with which they maintained that the entrance wound was at or near the external<br />\noccipital protuberance, rather than at the cowlick, where an apparent entry wound now appears.\"<br />\n\u2014 The chief autopsist, Dr. James Humes, answered a question about bullet wounds from Commissioner Allen<br />\nDulles(who had earlier been fired by Kennedy as director of the CIA) by saying that he believed it was impossible<br />\nfor the bullet \". . .to have exited from other than behind.\" (Dr. Clark also told the Commissioners that the \"<br />\nMissile had gone in and out of the back of the head.\"<br />\nOn the basis of these comments by the medical witnesses \u2014 and of the official autopsy report which was<br />\nprinted in 1964 \u2014 it seems probable that the President was hit twice in the head, once from behind and once from<br />\nin front. The report said that there was an entry wound 2.5 centimeters from the occipital protuberance and a large<br />\ndefect in the back of the head extending into the occiput.<br />\nSome investigators have determined that a tape made during the shooting actually has seven shots on it.<br />\nThe president would appear to have been hit four times, from the weight of the evidence; John Connally hit<br />\nwith a fifth bullet, bystander James Tague hit with a sixth bullet, and the sidewalk hit with the seventh bullet.<br />\nFilms, photographs and other evidence show clearly that the president was shot from in front as well as from<br />\nbehind, and that John Connally was hit with a separate bullet, as he has always claimed.<br />\nPhotographs show clearly that the wound in the president's throat occurred long before the Warren Commission said that it copld have, and that it had to come from in front, as the doctors in Dallas had said. This wound<br />\nwas unrelated to the back wound,and not related to the bullet which struck Connally.<br />\nAccording to most legal scholars, the testimony of witnesses who are physically present at the scene of contested events and who can then testify about what they saw there takes precedence over all other forms of<br />\nevidence.<br />\nIf so, then the weight of the evidence in the still-unsolved, 18-year-old Kennedy slaying(the House Committee<br />\nofficially declared in 1979 that the President had been killed as the result of a conspiracy, and that it believed there<br />\nhad been more than one gunman and more than three shots fired) clearly rests on the testimony of those who first<br />\nlooked at and treated the dying President.<br />\nThe first, spontaneous reactions of these medical witnesses to the autopsy photographs, which the government<br />\nhas heretofore refused to show to them, are too strong and too definite to be ignored. It seems highly unlikely that<br />\nall of them could have been mistaken about what they saw.<br /><br />\nincident. Various experts have different theories<br />\nabout where the shots came from and even about the<br />\nnumber of assassins. Livingstone believes there were<br />\nseveral assassins firing from different directions,<br />\nincluding from the Grassy Knoll at Dealy Plaza (also<br />\ntheorized by David S. Lifton, author of Best Evidence)<br />\nand from a manhole to the left of the approaching<br />\nlimousine. Medical experts' statements on the wounds,<br />\nand films of the incident, corroborate this theory.<br />\nThis analysis would explain the implausibility of<br />\nwhat has come to be known as the Magic Bullet Theory<br />\n\u2014which refers to the explanation given by the government for how three gunshots managed to hit Kennedy<br />\nthree times, Texas governor John Connally once, and a<br />\nbystander once: It was said that the bullet passed<br />\nthrough Kennedy's body (through the throat) and into<br />\nConnally's back. The point of contention is that there<br />\nwere more grains of metal left in the two victims than<br />\nwas lost from the virtually whole \"magic bullet\".<br />\nAccording to Livingstone's theory in which six<br />\nshots were fired:<br />\n\u2014 The first shot missed, hitting a bystander.<br />\n\u2014 The second shot, from in front of the motorcade, hit Kennedy in the throat (the hole in the throat<br />\nwas later enlarged to insert a breathing tube).<br />\n\u2014 The third shot hit Kennedy in the back.<br />\n\u2014 The fourth shot hit Texas governor John Connally from the back.<br />\n\u2014 The fifth and sixth shots hit Kennedy, almost<br />\nsimultaneously, with the fifth shot hitting him in the<br />\nback of the head and the sixth shot, from the front,<br />\nhitting him in the front of the head.<br /><br />\nTHE CONSPIRACY<br />\nAccording to Livingstone, the conspiracy developed<br />\namong powerful political and business forces in the<br />\ncountry. The event was the firing of top CIA officials<br />\nafter the Bay of Pigs fiasco. This was only the proverbial straw though,as Livingstone sees it, the underlying<br />\ncause was that military, industrial, financial, and<br />\nintelligence leaders, as well as political figures, were<br />\nunable to control Kennedy.<br />\n\"Leadership of the Republican party condoned<br />\nand ratified these murders,\" Livingstone said, including<br />\namong the Republican leadership the names of Richard<br />\nNixon, Gerald Ford, Allan Dulles, and Ronald Reagan.<br />\n\"Reagan, as Governor of California, refused to<br />\nextradite an important witness for the conspiracy trials<br />\nin New Orleans,\" he said. \"Nixon, as vice-president,<br />\ndirectly controlled the intelligence people who were<br />\ninvolved at the operational level of the murder.\"<br />\nLivingstone also contends that the CIA was<br />\ninvolved in a \"misinformation campaign\" in order to<br />\nmisdirect research. One key argument Livingstone uses<br />\nto support this is the fact that at least 13 of the eyewitnesses to the assassination were dead before the Warren<br />\nreport was issued. The odds against so many witnesses<br />\ndying coincidentally are astronomical.<br /><br />\nTHEMOHVES<br />\nLivingstone cited many motives for the conspira-tors to have taken such drastic action:<br />\nThe Vietnam War \u2014 A month before the assassination,<br />\nKennedy had begun to withdraw troops from Vietnam.<br />\nKennedy planned to pull 1000 troops out by Christmas<br />\nand to have all troops out by 1965. According to<br />\nLivingstone, the conspirators were pro-war because of<br />\nthe economic benefits for their circle.<br />\nForeign Relations \u2014 Kennedy was seeking detente with<br />\nRussia and Cuba through secret negotiations.<br />\nNuclear Arms \u2014 .The \"radical right\" objected to the<br />\nnuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union because<br />\nit slowed development of nuclear arms.<br />\nBay of Pigs \u2014 The firing of the CIA's high command<br />\nwas part of an effort by Kennedy to bring the CIA<br />\nunder his control. The deputy director's brother was<br />\nthe mayor of Dallas, which facilitated the murder and<br />\ncover-up.<br />\nThe confounding problem of the entire episode is<br />\nthat such an important historical event could be so<br />\npoorly or dubiously documented, so badly investigated, and next to impossible to reinvestigate. Livingraises<br />\nstone's theory may not be iron-clad but it<br />\nthe possibility of a government being able to hide,<br />\ncover up or forge evidence involved in the assassination<br />\nof a President.<br /><br />\nPAGE 12 / DECEMBER 4, 1981<br /><br />\nAelterie do/Aktit DAT es<br /><br />\nMCA<br /><br />\nHair Cutting &amp; Design<br />\nFor Men &amp; Women<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nTAKE IT<br />\nEASY!<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nCall Days Evenings &amp; Weekends<br /><br />\n4<br />\nN<br />\nEducational Cotter<br /><br />\n243-1456<br />\nCome Visit Our Center<br /><br />\nTEST PREPIUtATION<br />\nSPECIALISTS SINCE 1938<br />\n3121 St. Peal Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21218<br />\nCenters in.Maior US Cities Toronto, Puerto Rico and Zurich, Switzerland<br /><br />\n,k0<br /><br />\n100 E. 33rd St. I BLOCK FROM CAMPUS<br />\nFor Appointment Tues - Sat - Call<br />\n235-7083<br />\nSpecial Student Rate - with I.D.<br /><br />\nHEALTHY MALES 19---marmg\"\"N\"135<br />\nMay be eligible to<br />\nearn $100-$500 NOW<br />\nP-K Laborat ones asks you to join our program<br />\nas a participant in physician's supervised studies<br />\nCall for more information<br /><br />\nPHARMA\u2014KINETICS<br />\n366-2030<br />\n104 E.25th St.<br />\n9A.M.-5 P.M.<br />\nCurrently, we have a special need<br />\nfor a non-smoker group as well<br /><br />\n00p0000000000000000000000<br /><br />\nUNLIMITED 000<br />\n0\u00b0 HAIR<br />\n3120 Saint Paul Street<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\n235-0741<br />\no<br />\nO 00000Ce0000-0Q000000000000<br /><br />\nIf your hair isn't becoming to you!<br />\nYou should be coming to us.<br /><br />\nOpen Monday through Saturday 10-6<br /><br />\nril=ex=x1c===xsc=Disc=a4=Dest==x<br /><br />\n1<br />\n1<br /><br />\n1011 W.36th Street<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland<br /><br />\nCall 332-4150<br /><br />\n467-24E<br /><br />\nWhy spend so much money for a meal at<br />\nthe other restaurants?

This is more<br />\neasily said than done because Gilliam, of<br />\ncourse, is the American member of<br />\nMonty Python, the writer and animator<br />\nwhose cartoons gave such a bizarre<br />\ntexture to the group's famed Flying<br />\nCircus TV series. Gilliam wrote the<br />\nscreenplay for Time Bandits with fellow<br />\nPythoner Michael Palin, and a third<br />\nmember of the group, John Cleese, has a<br />\nrole in the film. All this would lead<br />\naudiences to anticipate outrageous and<br />\nirreverent comedy in the style of Monty<br /><br />\nPython and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian,<br />\nand Gilliam's only other solo effort, the<br />\nmorbidly amusing Jabberwocky. But<br />\nwhile Time Bandits is funny, it's hardly<br />\nscandalous; it's a benign fantasy which<br />\nrecalls The Wizard of Oz more than<br />\nanything else.<br />\nThe movie concerns itself with the<br />\nadventures of Kevin (Craig Warnock), an<br />\n11-year-old boy from England in whose<br />\nbedroom cliset a group of rustic midgets<br />\nappears one night. They are fleeing the<br />\nwrath of the Supreme Being, creator of<br />\nA seafaring ogre(Peter Vaughan)and his wife(Katherine Helm)nd) haul in the bandits.<br />\nthe world, and carry with them a map<br />\nthey have stolen from him which pin- Kevin, unhappy with the bourgeois audience as possible.

Rabe, a Vietnam veteran, returned<br />\nto the states in the late '60s, filled with<br />\ntormenting memories of the war. Shortly<br />\nthereafter, he established himself as a<br />\ntalented new playwright with a series of<br />\nplays centering around his experiences in<br />\nSoutheast Asia.<br />\nRabe wrote Sticks and Bones in 1971<br />\n-before America's \"Peace with Honor\"<br />\n- before the fall of Saigon in '75 - and<br />\nbefore America would comfortably push<br />\naside the senseless bloodshed of some 13<br />\nyears. But to see the play for its historical<br />\nimportance alone is to ignore it as a<br />\nmasterful piece of theater. The play<br />\nbelongs to a form only to itself. It is<br />\ncomic, black, tragic, and absurd - all at<br />\nonce. Traditional categories can't quite<br />\ndescribe Rabe's mixture of forms. Yet<br />\none thing certainly can be said of the<br />\nplay: it is always disturbing and comes to<br />\nlife at the Fells Point Theater.<br />\nAs the lights come up we find<br />\nourselves seated in the average American<br />\nhome of Ozzie and Harriet Nelson and<br />\ntheir guitar-playing son, Rickie.

In the<br />\nstory, an author, F,* has just written a<br />\nrevealing book about his past affiliation<br />\nwith the CIA, and is beginning work on<br />\nhis second book, which he hopes will<br />\nrope that magical aura of sea adventurefantasy to a staunch mizzen mast of<br />\nrealism. This author is not a spy any*Professor Barth used flash cards to<br />\nindicate which of the characters was<br />\nspeaking. Unfortunately these cards only<br />\ncontained the first letter of their names,<br />\nwhich led to the untimely forgetting of<br />\ntheir names.<br /><br />\nHe's just writing books on his<br />\nyacht as he sails from Baltimore to<br />\nWashington, the Eastern Shore, and<br />\nplaces unknown. His relationship with<br />\nhis wife S is the most important aspect of<br />\nthe novel.<br />\nBut a friend D from his CIA past<br />\ntries to drag our author F and his story<br />\nback into a spy thriller. F has just had a<br />\nheart attack, and D speaks of a CIA drug<br />\nwhich causes heart attacks. D tells F that<br />\nthe government would like him to investigate certain mysterious islands in his.<br />\nyacht. F refuses; this isn't a spy novel,<br />\nafter all. Moments later, F has a mild<br />\nheart seizure.<br />\nBarth has both integrated and<br />\nrejected aspects of his earlier works. Like<br />\nLost in the Funhouse, Sabbatical is very<br />\nself-reflexive, constantly drawing attention to the fact that the novel is merely a<br />\nnovel.

This peculiarity was a<br />\nresult of the coexistence of the<br />\nNCAA and the newer AssociaIntercollegiate<br />\nfor<br />\ntion<br />\nAthletics for Women (AIAW).<br />\nMany of the MAC teams<br />\nbelong to the AIAW, which<br />\nhad its own regional championship.

Even<br />\nafter these losses coach Kay<br />\nFowler remains optimistic about<br />\nthe season and hopes to end it at<br />\nthe .500 mark, a big improvement over last year's dismal 3-12<br />\nrecord.<br />\nThe first game of the seasoh<br />\nwas at St. Mary's College Nov.<br />\n24, with Hopkins losing 60-51.<br />\nThe team stayed even with its<br />\nopponents until the score was<br />\n13-all, but then its offense<br /><br />\n/11.\u2022 Fourth and 1 To Go!<br />\nBY MICHAEL FINGERHOOD<br />\nTime out is called. Two<br />\nseconds are left in the game.<br />\nThe ball rests on the 30-yard<br />\nline, just inside the left hashmark. He wanders onto the<br />\nfield. His face shows no emotion. His teammates holler<br />\nencouragement. His team trails<br />\nby two points. The holder<br />\ncrouches at the 37-yard line. It<br />\nwill be a 47-yard attempt. He<br />\nclears away a rock from the<br />\nfield. He reties his shoelace. His<br />\nblood pressure rises. The crowd<br />\nrises. He stands a yard behind<br />\nthe holder. The wind is in his<br />\nface. The two teams line<br />\nup. The ball is snapped. It's<br />\nplaced. He boots it. The ball is<br />\nup...<br />\nThe place-kicker. Either<br />\nhe's a goat or a hero. There's<br />\nno comparable position in any<br />\nother sport. The kicker plays<br />\nabout 30 seconds a game, yet<br />\nhe's an integral part of the<br /><br />\nteam. His team can't win<br />\nwithout him anymore than it<br />\ncan win without its starting<br />\nquarterback.<br />\nIn a jungle of 6'4\", 250 lb.<br />\ngorillas, kickers are usually<br />\neasy to spot. They're typically<br />\n5'9\", 160 lbs., balding, bowlegged, have bad posture, and<br />\noften speak with an accent.<br />\nSometimes they can do more<br />\nthan kick, as evidenced by<br />\nEffren Herrera of the Seattle<br />\nSeahawks. Herrera has caught<br />\nthree passes out of the fake<br />\nfield goal formation in the past<br />\ntwo seasons. Occasionally,<br />\nkickers can pass too. George<br />\nBlanda played well into his<br />\nforties as a kicker and back-up<br />\nquarterback. Other kickers,<br />\nsuch as Caro Yepremian, have<br />\ntried their hand at throwing,<br />\nwith disastrous results.<br />\nKickers drive coaches<br />\ncrazy. They hit a 55-yard field<br />\ngoal and then miss an extra<br />\npoint. In addition, kickers<br /><br />\n. re (left) and Hakmiller battle in practice.<br />\nTessito<br /><br />\noften get into horrendous<br />\nslumps during which, they<br />\nclaim, it seems as if the goal<br />\nposts are six inches apart. But<br />\nthen all of a sudden, after<br />\nmissing seven straight attempts,<br />\nthey drill seven in a row. The<br />\ncrowd that once booed now<br />\ncheers.<br /><br />\nSometimes the ,boos can<br />\nturn to cheers on a single play.<br />\nFor instance, in Hopkins' final<br />\ngame<br />\nWestern<br />\nagainst<br />\nMaryland, Joe Nador had his<br />\nwinning field goal attempt<br />\nblocked, but still came out a<br />\nhero by falling on the ball at<br />\nthe one-yard line.<br />\nSo if you want to be a<br />\nfootball player, but you aren't<br />\nbig enough, or you are big<br />\nenough, but don't feel like<br />\nbeing crunched, be a kicker.<br />\nEither you'll be a hero who's<br />\nforgotten a week later or a goat<br />\nwho's long remembered.<br /><br />\nstalled for the rest of the half.<br />\nAt halftime, the score was<br />\n32-14.<br />\nThe second half was a<br />\ncompletely different story as the<br />\nteam executed its full-court<br />\npress brilliantly and created a lot<br />\nof turnovers. The Blue Jays were<br />\nable to pull within six points,<br />\nbut a three-point play by St.<br />\nMary's at the buzzer established<br />\nthe final margin.<br />\nThe loss to Gallaudet was<br />\neven more heart-breaking, as<br />\nHopkins lost in overtime by a<br />\n63-60 score. It was an extremely<br />\nclose game, with the Blue Jays<br />\nleading 25-24 at the half. Dawn<br />\nRichards tied the game at 53-all<br />\nwith a minute left in regulation<br />\ntime and the defense was able to<br />\nstop Gallaudet on its next<br />\npossession. With less than a<br />\nminute left in overtime and the<br />\nscore tied at 60-60, a Gallaudet<br />\nplayer grabbed the rebound of a<br />\nteammate's missed foul shot and<br />\nwas fouled while hitting her own<br />\nshot. After completing the threepoint play, Gallaudet was able to<br /><br />\nHopkins from scoring.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were once<br />\nagain victimized by fouls, as the<br />\nreferees were inconsistent in<br />\ntheir calls. Geraldine Klauber,<br />\nwith eight points and four<br />\nrebounds, fouled out of the<br />\ngame with eight minutes left in<br />\nregulation time. Sue Tyler also<br />\nhad to leave the game with four<br />\nminutes left. However, the<br />\nbench contributed a lot, as the<br />\nplay of Kim Stevens and Kathleen King allowed Hopkins to<br />\nstay in the game.

Heather<br />\nDick won two events, the<br />\n500-meter and 1000-meter freestyles.
