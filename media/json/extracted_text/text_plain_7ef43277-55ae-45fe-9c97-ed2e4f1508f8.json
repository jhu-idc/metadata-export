Note: the following statement by Wesley Taylor, Hopkins Plant<br />\nManager, was sent to the News-Letter after this issue's copy had gone<br />\nto the printer. The regular text of the article and the related editorial<br />\non page 4 were written before receipt of this statement. As of Tuesday, according to Mr. Taylor's office, the only factor holding up the<br />\npurchase of Mace was the possibility that its effects would be harmful. There was no explanation for the change in policy which transpired between Tuesday and Wednesday evening.<br />\nThere has been considerable discussion among members of the<br />\nstudent body, representatives of the Plant Manager's Office and the<br />\nUniversity administration regarding the security of the Campus and<br />\nthe arming of Campus police.<br />\nThis statement has been prepared to put these discussions in perspective and to set the record straight.<br />\nEffective immediately, and until further notice, Campus police<br />\nofficers will not be equipped with side arms.<br />\nThey will not carry chemical mace.<br />\nThey will not use \"police dogs.\"<br />\nHowever, it is important to note that the Campus police are<br />\ncharged with the general protection of students, faculty, employees<br />\nand University property. They must fulfill this task under circumstances today which are presenting them with more serious situations<br />\nthan in the past. There have been more attempts at burglary, and<br />\nother crimes, including attacks on individual members of the University community in recent years than in the past. In order to carry<br />\nout their duties adquately they must be properly equipped.<br />\nDiscussions will be held promptly to determine what equipment<br />\nthey should have in order to meet their responsibilities and to protect themselves from physical harm from intruders. A final, policy<br />\nstatement will be issued following those discussions.<br />\nHopkins has decided to supply its security personnel with chemical Mace, a sometimes deadly compound produced by the General<br />\nOrdinance Equipment division of Smith and Wesson Company and<br />\nused by more than 3,000 U.S. police departments.<br />\nAccording to Robert Bilgrave,Director of Student Affairs, George<br />\nWeinbach, Campus Security Chief, and William Campbell, Assistant<br />\nto the Plant Manager, the addition of Mace to the University arsenal<br />\nbecame necessary after a series of recent molestings in front of the<br />\nEisenhower Library.<br />\nOfficials hope that the chemical will act as a deterrent, and pointed to the deteriorating neighborhood around the Homewood campus<br />\nand the soaring crime rate as justification.<br />\nMarauders<br />\nMr. Weinbach expressed fears that bands of marauding teenagersknown to frequent the campus present a danger to unarmed Hopkins policemen and students. \"Hell, all we're trying to do is defend<br />\nthe campus.\"<br />\nPresent policy permits individual policemen to decide for themselves whether or not they wish to carry guns. However, three out of<br />\nfive have declined.<br />\nThe Graduate Club, under the leadership of President John Ferchak, voiced its disapproval of the use of arms and Mace, and requested the administration to look into other means of defense such<br />\nas increases in lighting and guards.<br />\nAcademic Council<br />\nDr. John Owen of Political Economy plans to bring the matter<br />\nbefore the Academic Council, and Mr. Bilgrave is scheduling a special<br />\nmeeting of the Committee on Student Affairs for next week.<br />\nAccording to Mr. Weinbach, decisions on campus security are<br />\nmade by the Plant Manager's Office in consultation with Homewood House. Inexplicably, John Peach, another Assistant Plant Manager,<br />\ndenied the University's planned acquisition of Mace.<br />\nChemical Mace contains 5 per cent methyl chloreform, an industrial solvent,and less than 1 per cent tear gas, phenylmethylchloroketone. In the May 6 issue of Newsweek Magazine, Dr. Lawrence Rose,<br />\na practicing San Francisco opthalmologist claimed that Mace can<br />\ncause \"substantial damage to the eyes, skin and respiratory system.\"<br />\nMace Damage<br />\nDr. Rose claims, \"Of the nine cases of Macing I have examined<br />\nthoroughly, four patients had second degree facial and eyelid skin<br />\nburns with deep redness, blistering and pain for 24 to 72 hours and<br />\nskin pigment changes lasting two to five weeks.\"<br />\nAlan Litman, 33 yeai old physicist inventor of Mace insists that<br />\nthere has been no permanent damage in any of the \"thousands of<br />\nrecorded uses by police.\" The Ann Arbor, Michigan Police Depart-<br />\n<br />\nPic by Tom Lemm<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on Page 3)<br />\n<br />\nActivists Plan Protest<br />\n<br />\nSee Page<br />\nTwo<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 2<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,MAY 10, 1968<br />\n<br />\nNEW-LETTER<br />\n<br />\n* Campus Notes *<br />\nORIENTATION<br />\nStudents interested in being<br />\ngroup leaders for orientation next<br />\nfall, should fill out applications<br />\nfor the Orientation Committee.<br />\nApplications are available in the<br />\nhall just outside the Office of Student Affairs, Gilman 254.

Perry<br />\nexplained that because Goucher is<br />\non a trimester system, examination and vacation schedules for<br />\nHopkins and Goucher do not<br />\ncoincide. Similarily, due to the<br />\ndiffering length of the semesters,<br />\ncourses at Hopkins cover substantially different material. This<br />\ncondition makes it difficult to<br />\ncomplete departmental requirements in an inter-university program.<br />\nPerry stated that Dr. Swanson,<br />\nHopkins' Dean of the Undergraduate Faculty and his counterpart at Goucher are presently<br />\nattempting to resolve the major<br />\nconflicts preventing a close Goucher-Hopkins relationship. Perry<br />\nhopes that a compromise on such<br />\nissues as calendar reform may be<br />\nachieved between the two schools.<br />\nPerry further hopes that the<br />\nfaculty chairmen will be able to<br />\nwork together in order to avoid<br />\nmajor course conflicts. \"There are<br />\nnow several popular courses at<br />\nGoucher which are not available<br />\nto Hopkins' students because of<br />\nsuch conflicts\" he said.<br />\nThere is, in addition, some<br />\nhope that a viable system of<br />\ntransportation between the two<br />\nschools may be initiated. \"Such a<br />\nsystem will greatly facilitate interschool programs\". There is, however, no indication that Goucher<br />\nand Hopkins will merge at any<br />\nforseeable future date.<br />\nDr. Perry stated that \"from<br />\nhere, there are no limits to what<br />\ncan be done.

Sloan<br />\n<br />\nPHOTOGRAPHY EDITOR<br />\nThomas V. Hoffman<br />\n<br />\nBreakthrough For The Slums<br />\nOver the past year, Maryland has produced a mediocre crop of<br />\npolitical leaders - - Governor Agnew,County Executive Dale Anderson, gubernatorial aspirant George Mahoney (now running for a<br />\nSenate seat), et al. However, despite our scepticism last fall, Baltimore's freshman mayor, Thomas D'Alesandro, is proving to be one<br />\nof the few promising personalities in Maryland politics.<br />\nWe are particularly impressed with Mayor D'Alesandro's recent<br />\nproposals for alleviating the crisis of the Inner City. This past week,<br />\nD'Alesandro presented a plan to recruit black residents of the city to<br />\nbuy and reopen Inner City businesses which white merchants are unloading largely due to the unfortunate destruction of the riots. Furthermore, D'Alesandro wants to offer crash-training programs to<br />\npotential black storeowners in order to prepare them for operating<br />\nthese businesses.<br />\nThe importance of such a program cannot be overemphasized and<br />\nthe mayor deserves praise for the insight he has shown.The Moynihan<br />\nstudies of New York have shown the importance of developing entrepeneurial classes among depressed minority groups. The abilities<br />\nof immigrant groups such as the Jews, Italians or Irish to develop,<br />\nsuch a class proved to be keys to upward social mobility. America's<br />\nNegro population, with their unique historical development due, of<br />\ncourse, mainly to their past enslavement, have never been able to<br />\nemulate this formation of an entrepeneurial class. Hopefully,<br />\nMayor D'Alesandro's program will be a beginning to correct this<br />\nsituation and to provide the Inner City Negro with some of the<br />\nmeans for self-help.<br />\nThis plan is only indicative of the overall progressive attitude<br />\nwhich the Mayor has displayed. Belatedly,we would like to commend<br />\nhim for refusing to be caught in the post-riot onrush of backlash, a la<br />\nAgnew. Perhaps, the Mayor may turn out to be one factor which<br />\nwill allow a \"cool\" summer to prevail in Baltimore.<br />\n<br />\nThe Siege At Homewood<br />\nWhen a situation involving the projected use of a measure such as<br />\nchemical Mace arises, any discussion of the issue is endangered by<br />\nemotionalism. A case in point was the biological warfare dispute<br />\nwhich occurred last year. There is also the danger of trying to create<br />\na great debate over an issue which is relatively insignificant when<br />\ncompared to the crises in our society today.<br />\nIn this vein, we only wish to raise a few questions for future discussion concerning the University's prospective purchase of Mace.<br />\nBasically, we wonder why the Plant Manager's office feels that<br />\nthe purchase of Mace is necessary. Incidents involving small groups<br />\nof offenders were cited as justification. Yet, how effective or necessary is Mace for the control of random incidents provoked by scattered, disorganized groups? We can see no justification for the contention that Hopkins will be menaced by crowds such as those which<br />\namassed at Columbia or those which occur in riot situations - - and<br />\nit is in these cases where the use of Mace, if justified at all, is most<br />\neffective.<br />\nThere is also a question which has ramifications for future discussions. Should the plant manager's office have the authority to initiate<br />\nsuch measures without a general consultation of affected segments<br />\nof the University? It seems to us that the decision would have remained completely in Wesley Taylor's hands if some student and<br />\nfaculty members had not found out about his plans and protested.<br />\nFinally, we are worried about the planned distribution of Mace to<br />\nthe elderly men who comprise the staffs of night watchmen and<br />\ncampus police. Trained police and riot control forces have shown<br />\npast indiscriminate use of these weapons. Who will vouch for the<br />\ncapabilities of Hopkins security force whose job is largely to ticket<br />\nerrant cars? Mace, carelessly used at close range as would be the case<br />\njudging from the incidents cited at Hopkins involving small groups,<br />\nhas caused both temporary and permanent damage. If the Hopkins<br />\nsecurity people are as potentially outnumbered and threatened as it<br />\nis claimed, the caliber of the men who comprise it should be exhaustively assessed before they are armed with guns, much less Mace.<br />\nThese are questions which must be asked and with the upcoming<br />\nmeetings of the Academic Council and Committee of Student Affairs,<br />\nwe hope that they will be fully explored.<br />\n<br />\nAccuse Us Not<br />\nSince next week is the last issue of the current semester, The<br />\nNews-Letter is taking this opportunity to experiment with different<br />\ntabloid formats. Thus, we humbly beg not to be accused of sensationalism due to the appearance of this week's front page, which is a<br />\nstyle frequently used by dailies such as Long Island's Newsday.

Only<br />\nGod has the omniscient selfishness<br />\nfor that. And neither Mr. Nixon<br />\nnor Grayson Kirk can quite make<br />\nit as God, all their personal sentiments to the contrary.<br />\nThe point is that it's not a<br />\nquestion of having one's cake and<br />\neating it too. The shit that went<br />\ninto America's cake is carefully<br />\nconcealed beneath a precarious<br />\nlayer of very fattening icing\u2014something which we as students have<br />\nto expose and get rid of, to revamp everything below.<br />\nA lot of people feel sorry for<br />\nColumbia. What a shame that such<br />\na bastion of knowledge, a community of scholars which grew up<br />\nhand-in-hand with these United<br />\nStates should fall prey to the<br />\nnihilistic rhetoric of a handful of<br />\nCommunist<br />\nagitators.<br />\nWhy<br />\ncouldn't it have been Slippery<br />\nRock State Teacher's College?<br />\nThat would .have been easy to explain - the administration could<br />\nhave blamed the uprising on the<br />\nfood, or dorm restrictions, and<br />\nLife could have come out with a<br />\npsychological interpretation, attributing the commotion to a \"need<br />\nto be noticed\" la Lee Harvey<br />\nOswald.<br />\nBut Columbia? That's serious<br />\nstuff - upper zero percent of the<br />\ncountry, and all that. Don't fool<br />\nyourself, Virginia, they've got it<br />\n<br />\npretty good up there - good professors, good courses, girls, good<br />\ndorms, a decent city - and they<br />\nare not all \"Jewish Nigger-lovers.\"<br />\nThey are Americans,just like LynJohnson or Frank Robinson or<br />\nLincoln Gordon - except that they<br />\nare concerned with what's being<br />\ndone to them.<br />\nColumbia's was no Spring<br />\nWeekend, no adolescent fun-andgames. It was and continues to be<br />\nin dead earnest, and the seeds that<br />\nwere planted must not be allowed<br />\nto die, either in New York or across the rest of the country. Education in the United States has<br />\nbecome entirely too money-concious for its own good. It has taken upon itself the responsibility<br />\nof creating a huge funnel with<br />\nwhich to feed the Establishment<br />\nthe best and most indoctrinated<br />\nminds that American motherhood<br />\ncan produce. Barton Hall is a far<br />\ncry from what Mr. Johns Hopkins<br />\nhad in mind back in 1876.<br />\nIt has become time to stop<br />\nblindly accepting what we are being told. Just give us the facts,<br />\nbaby, and we'll do our own thinking. Pause for a moment on your<br />\ngoddamn ladders of success and<br />\nlook down at the evils below.

Students must coordinate<br />\ntheir efforts at gaining improvements, and administrators will<br />\n<br />\nhave to realize that for all the<br />\nmoney, they had better upgrade<br />\nthe quality of their product. And<br />\nthat product is education as well<br />\nas decent possibilities for social<br />\nand emotional happiness, and not<br />\na business-oriented channeling as<br />\nMr. Hershey and his buddies would<br />\nhave it.<br />\nWill Hopkins explode? It very<br />\nwell may not be as funny as it<br />\nsounds.Things wouldn't go as easily as at Columbia, for we have<br />\nno ghetto nor even a responsive<br />\ncommunity nearby, and students<br />\nhere are less confident of their<br />\npower. However there are many<br />\nvery serious faults with our fair<br />\nmultiversity, and perhaps Dr. Gordon would be well advised to center his capabilities upon Homewood rather than on our Bologna<br />\nbrothers in the next few weeks.<br />\nViolence and brutality are always a drag. There is no fun in<br />\nrebellion. It is particularly inexcusable on the campus, for by all<br />\nstandards, students, faculty and<br />\nadministration should be working<br />\ntogether for a goal much larger<br />\nthan politics or power struggles.<br />\nThere is, however, a limit to how<br />\nfar students can be pushed before<br />\nthere is a reaction.

This is despite an offer of the Stadium by Mr. William Schmidt of the Parks Department, whose ground crews would<br />\nhave had to zip through a rapid transformation for the Bays-Dallas<br />\nsoccer tilt under the archs. Both the Hopkins' administration and the<br />\nNews-Letter wish to express grateful appreciation to Mr. Frank<br />\nCashen, executive vice president of the Orioles, Mr. Bill Corcoran of<br />\nof the Bays,and the entire front office for the time and consideration<br />\ngiven the proposal.<br />\nThe Orioles (who own the Bays) were willing to lease the field<br />\nunder the stipulation that in case of intensive rain the game would<br />\nmove back to Homewood. This clause is entirely understandable,<br />\nsince priority must go to the golden ankles of Frank Robinson and<br />\nPaul Blair, who usually inhabit the outfield turf. Naturally, Hopkins<br />\ncouldn't risk the oddsmalcers on \"Television Hill\" and the possibility<br />\nof financing two games, plus publicity chaos; places the game where<br />\nit belongs, at Hopkins.<br />\nThe following are the special procedures installed for the benefit<br />\nof students, alumni, peace & order and Hopkins' \"Rent-a-Cops\":<br />\nBoth gates will be open from 12:15 to 1:15 for: Students with<br />\nJHU 1.D. cards and one guest or family unit; full time faculty with<br />\nlibrary I.D. which will also admit his family.

Note: the following statement by Wesley Taylor, Hopkins Plant<br />\nManager, was sent to the News-Letter after this issue's copy had gone<br />\nto the printer. The regular text of the article and the related editorial<br />\non page 4 were written before receipt of this statement. As of Tuesday, according to Mr. Taylor's office, the only factor holding up the<br />\npurchase of Mace was the possibility that its effects would be harmful. There was no explanation for the change in policy which transpired between Tuesday and Wednesday evening.<br />\nThere has been considerable discussion among members of the<br />\nstudent body, representatives of the Plant Manager's Office and the<br />\nUniversity administration regarding the security of the Campus and<br />\nthe arming of Campus police.<br />\nThis statement has been prepared to put these discussions in perspective and to set the record straight.<br />\nEffective immediately, and until further notice, Campus police<br />\nofficers will not be equipped with side arms.<br />\nThey will not carry chemical mace.<br />\nThey will not use \"police dogs.\"<br />\nHowever, it is important to note that the Campus police are<br />\ncharged with the general protection of students, faculty, employees<br />\nand University property. They must fulfill this task under circumstances today which are presenting them with more serious situations<br />\nthan in the past. There have been more attempts at burglary, and<br />\nother crimes, including attacks on individual members of the University community in recent years than in the past. In order to carry<br />\nout their duties adquately they must be properly equipped.<br />\nDiscussions will be held promptly to determine what equipment<br />\nthey should have in order to meet their responsibilities and to protect themselves from physical harm from intruders. A final, policy<br />\nstatement will be issued following those discussions.<br />\nHopkins has decided to supply its security personnel with chemical Mace, a sometimes deadly compound produced by the General<br />\nOrdinance Equipment division of Smith and Wesson Company and<br />\nused by more than 3,000 U.S. police departments.<br />\nAccording to Robert Bilgrave,Director of Student Affairs, George<br />\nWeinbach, Campus Security Chief, and William Campbell, Assistant<br />\nto the Plant Manager, the addition of Mace to the University arsenal<br />\nbecame necessary after a series of recent molestings in front of the<br />\nEisenhower Library.<br />\nOfficials hope that the chemical will act as a deterrent, and pointed to the deteriorating neighborhood around the Homewood campus<br />\nand the soaring crime rate as justification.<br />\nMarauders<br />\nMr. Weinbach expressed fears that bands of marauding teenagersknown to frequent the campus present a danger to unarmed Hopkins policemen and students. \"Hell, all we're trying to do is defend<br />\nthe campus.\"<br />\nPresent policy permits individual policemen to decide for themselves whether or not they wish to carry guns. However, three out of<br />\nfive have declined.<br />\nThe Graduate Club, under the leadership of President John Ferchak, voiced its disapproval of the use of arms and Mace, and requested the administration to look into other means of defense such<br />\nas increases in lighting and guards.<br />\nAcademic Council<br />\nDr. John Owen of Political Economy plans to bring the matter<br />\nbefore the Academic Council, and Mr. Bilgrave is scheduling a special<br />\nmeeting of the Committee on Student Affairs for next week.<br />\nAccording to Mr. Weinbach, decisions on campus security are<br />\nmade by the Plant Manager's Office in consultation with Homewood House. Inexplicably, John Peach, another Assistant Plant Manager,<br />\ndenied the University's planned acquisition of Mace.<br />\nChemical Mace contains 5 per cent methyl chloreform, an industrial solvent,and less than 1 per cent tear gas, phenylmethylchloroketone. In the May 6 issue of Newsweek Magazine, Dr. Lawrence Rose,<br />\na practicing San Francisco opthalmologist claimed that Mace can<br />\ncause \"substantial damage to the eyes, skin and respiratory system.\"<br />\nMace Damage<br />\nDr. Rose claims, \"Of the nine cases of Macing I have examined<br />\nthoroughly, four patients had second degree facial and eyelid skin<br />\nburns with deep redness, blistering and pain for 24 to 72 hours and<br />\nskin pigment changes lasting two to five weeks.\"<br />\nAlan Litman, 33 yeai old physicist inventor of Mace insists that<br />\nthere has been no permanent damage in any of the \"thousands of<br />\nrecorded uses by police.\" The Ann Arbor, Michigan Police Depart-<br /><br />\nPic by Tom Lemm<br /><br />\n(Continued on Page 3)<br /><br />\nActivists Plan Protest<br /><br />\nSee Page<br />\nTwo<br /><br />\nPAGE 2<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,MAY 10, 1968<br /><br />\nNEW-LETTER<br /><br />\n* Campus Notes *<br />\nORIENTATION<br />\nStudents interested in being<br />\ngroup leaders for orientation next<br />\nfall, should fill out applications<br />\nfor the Orientation Committee.<br />\nApplications are available in the<br />\nhall just outside the Office of Student Affairs, Gilman 254.

Perry<br />\nexplained that because Goucher is<br />\non a trimester system, examination and vacation schedules for<br />\nHopkins and Goucher do not<br />\ncoincide. Similarily, due to the<br />\ndiffering length of the semesters,<br />\ncourses at Hopkins cover substantially different material. This<br />\ncondition makes it difficult to<br />\ncomplete departmental requirements in an inter-university program.<br />\nPerry stated that Dr. Swanson,<br />\nHopkins' Dean of the Undergraduate Faculty and his counterpart at Goucher are presently<br />\nattempting to resolve the major<br />\nconflicts preventing a close Goucher-Hopkins relationship. Perry<br />\nhopes that a compromise on such<br />\nissues as calendar reform may be<br />\nachieved between the two schools.<br />\nPerry further hopes that the<br />\nfaculty chairmen will be able to<br />\nwork together in order to avoid<br />\nmajor course conflicts. \"There are<br />\nnow several popular courses at<br />\nGoucher which are not available<br />\nto Hopkins' students because of<br />\nsuch conflicts\" he said.<br />\nThere is, in addition, some<br />\nhope that a viable system of<br />\ntransportation between the two<br />\nschools may be initiated. \"Such a<br />\nsystem will greatly facilitate interschool programs\". There is, however, no indication that Goucher<br />\nand Hopkins will merge at any<br />\nforseeable future date.<br />\nDr. Perry stated that \"from<br />\nhere, there are no limits to what<br />\ncan be done.

Hoffman<br /><br />\nBreakthrough For The Slums<br />\nOver the past year, Maryland has produced a mediocre crop of<br />\npolitical leaders - - Governor Agnew,County Executive Dale Anderson, gubernatorial aspirant George Mahoney (now running for a<br />\nSenate seat), et al. However, despite our scepticism last fall, Baltimore's freshman mayor, Thomas D'Alesandro, is proving to be one<br />\nof the few promising personalities in Maryland politics.<br />\nWe are particularly impressed with Mayor D'Alesandro's recent<br />\nproposals for alleviating the crisis of the Inner City. This past week,<br />\nD'Alesandro presented a plan to recruit black residents of the city to<br />\nbuy and reopen Inner City businesses which white merchants are unloading largely due to the unfortunate destruction of the riots. Furthermore, D'Alesandro wants to offer crash-training programs to<br />\npotential black storeowners in order to prepare them for operating<br />\nthese businesses.<br />\nThe importance of such a program cannot be overemphasized and<br />\nthe mayor deserves praise for the insight he has shown.The Moynihan<br />\nstudies of New York have shown the importance of developing entrepeneurial classes among depressed minority groups. The abilities<br />\nof immigrant groups such as the Jews, Italians or Irish to develop,<br />\nsuch a class proved to be keys to upward social mobility. America's<br />\nNegro population, with their unique historical development due, of<br />\ncourse, mainly to their past enslavement, have never been able to<br />\nemulate this formation of an entrepeneurial class. Hopefully,<br />\nMayor D'Alesandro's program will be a beginning to correct this<br />\nsituation and to provide the Inner City Negro with some of the<br />\nmeans for self-help.<br />\nThis plan is only indicative of the overall progressive attitude<br />\nwhich the Mayor has displayed. Belatedly,we would like to commend<br />\nhim for refusing to be caught in the post-riot onrush of backlash, a la<br />\nAgnew. Perhaps, the Mayor may turn out to be one factor which<br />\nwill allow a \"cool\" summer to prevail in Baltimore.<br /><br />\nThe Siege At Homewood<br />\nWhen a situation involving the projected use of a measure such as<br />\nchemical Mace arises, any discussion of the issue is endangered by<br />\nemotionalism. A case in point was the biological warfare dispute<br />\nwhich occurred last year. There is also the danger of trying to create<br />\na great debate over an issue which is relatively insignificant when<br />\ncompared to the crises in our society today.<br />\nIn this vein, we only wish to raise a few questions for future discussion concerning the University's prospective purchase of Mace.<br />\nBasically, we wonder why the Plant Manager's office feels that<br />\nthe purchase of Mace is necessary. Incidents involving small groups<br />\nof offenders were cited as justification. Yet, how effective or necessary is Mace for the control of random incidents provoked by scattered, disorganized groups? We can see no justification for the contention that Hopkins will be menaced by crowds such as those which<br />\namassed at Columbia or those which occur in riot situations - - and<br />\nit is in these cases where the use of Mace, if justified at all, is most<br />\neffective.<br />\nThere is also a question which has ramifications for future discussions. Should the plant manager's office have the authority to initiate<br />\nsuch measures without a general consultation of affected segments<br />\nof the University? It seems to us that the decision would have remained completely in Wesley Taylor's hands if some student and<br />\nfaculty members had not found out about his plans and protested.<br />\nFinally, we are worried about the planned distribution of Mace to<br />\nthe elderly men who comprise the staffs of night watchmen and<br />\ncampus police. Trained police and riot control forces have shown<br />\npast indiscriminate use of these weapons. Who will vouch for the<br />\ncapabilities of Hopkins security force whose job is largely to ticket<br />\nerrant cars? Mace, carelessly used at close range as would be the case<br />\njudging from the incidents cited at Hopkins involving small groups,<br />\nhas caused both temporary and permanent damage. If the Hopkins<br />\nsecurity people are as potentially outnumbered and threatened as it<br />\nis claimed, the caliber of the men who comprise it should be exhaustively assessed before they are armed with guns, much less Mace.<br />\nThese are questions which must be asked and with the upcoming<br />\nmeetings of the Academic Council and Committee of Student Affairs,<br />\nwe hope that they will be fully explored.<br /><br />\nAccuse Us Not<br />\nSince next week is the last issue of the current semester, The<br />\nNews-Letter is taking this opportunity to experiment with different<br />\ntabloid formats. Thus, we humbly beg not to be accused of sensationalism due to the appearance of this week's front page, which is a<br />\nstyle frequently used by dailies such as Long Island's Newsday.

Only<br />\nGod has the omniscient selfishness<br />\nfor that. And neither Mr. Nixon<br />\nnor Grayson Kirk can quite make<br />\nit as God, all their personal sentiments to the contrary.<br />\nThe point is that it's not a<br />\nquestion of having one's cake and<br />\neating it too. The shit that went<br />\ninto America's cake is carefully<br />\nconcealed beneath a precarious<br />\nlayer of very fattening icing\u2014something which we as students have<br />\nto expose and get rid of, to revamp everything below.<br />\nA lot of people feel sorry for<br />\nColumbia. What a shame that such<br />\na bastion of knowledge, a community of scholars which grew up<br />\nhand-in-hand with these United<br />\nStates should fall prey to the<br />\nnihilistic rhetoric of a handful of<br />\nCommunist<br />\nagitators.<br />\nWhy<br />\ncouldn't it have been Slippery<br />\nRock State Teacher's College?<br />\nThat would .have been easy to explain - the administration could<br />\nhave blamed the uprising on the<br />\nfood, or dorm restrictions, and<br />\nLife could have come out with a<br />\npsychological interpretation, attributing the commotion to a \"need<br />\nto be noticed\" la Lee Harvey<br />\nOswald.<br />\nBut Columbia? That's serious<br />\nstuff - upper zero percent of the<br />\ncountry, and all that. Don't fool<br />\nyourself, Virginia, they've got it<br /><br />\npretty good up there - good professors, good courses, girls, good<br />\ndorms, a decent city - and they<br />\nare not all \"Jewish Nigger-lovers.\"<br />\nThey are Americans,just like LynJohnson or Frank Robinson or<br />\nLincoln Gordon - except that they<br />\nare concerned with what's being<br />\ndone to them.<br />\nColumbia's was no Spring<br />\nWeekend, no adolescent fun-andgames. It was and continues to be<br />\nin dead earnest, and the seeds that<br />\nwere planted must not be allowed<br />\nto die, either in New York or across the rest of the country. Education in the United States has<br />\nbecome entirely too money-concious for its own good. It has taken upon itself the responsibility<br />\nof creating a huge funnel with<br />\nwhich to feed the Establishment<br />\nthe best and most indoctrinated<br />\nminds that American motherhood<br />\ncan produce. Barton Hall is a far<br />\ncry from what Mr. Johns Hopkins<br />\nhad in mind back in 1876.<br />\nIt has become time to stop<br />\nblindly accepting what we are being told. Just give us the facts,<br />\nbaby, and we'll do our own thinking. Pause for a moment on your<br />\ngoddamn ladders of success and<br />\nlook down at the evils below.

Students must coordinate<br />\ntheir efforts at gaining improvements, and administrators will<br /><br />\nhave to realize that for all the<br />\nmoney, they had better upgrade<br />\nthe quality of their product. And<br />\nthat product is education as well<br />\nas decent possibilities for social<br />\nand emotional happiness, and not<br />\na business-oriented channeling as<br />\nMr. Hershey and his buddies would<br />\nhave it.<br />\nWill Hopkins explode? It very<br />\nwell may not be as funny as it<br />\nsounds.Things wouldn't go as easily as at Columbia, for we have<br />\nno ghetto nor even a responsive<br />\ncommunity nearby, and students<br />\nhere are less confident of their<br />\npower.

There is no fun in<br />\nrebellion. It is particularly inexcusable on the campus, for by all<br />\nstandards, students, faculty and<br />\nadministration should be working<br />\ntogether for a goal much larger<br />\nthan politics or power struggles.<br />\nThere is, however, a limit to how<br />\nfar students can be pushed before<br />\nthere is a reaction.

This is despite an offer of the Stadium by Mr. William Schmidt of the Parks Department, whose ground crews would<br />\nhave had to zip through a rapid transformation for the Bays-Dallas<br />\nsoccer tilt under the archs. Both the Hopkins' administration and the<br />\nNews-Letter wish to express grateful appreciation to Mr. Frank<br />\nCashen, executive vice president of the Orioles, Mr. Bill Corcoran of<br />\nof the Bays,and the entire front office for the time and consideration<br />\ngiven the proposal.<br />\nThe Orioles (who own the Bays) were willing to lease the field<br />\nunder the stipulation that in case of intensive rain the game would<br />\nmove back to Homewood. This clause is entirely understandable,<br />\nsince priority must go to the golden ankles of Frank Robinson and<br />\nPaul Blair, who usually inhabit the outfield turf. Naturally, Hopkins<br />\ncouldn't risk the oddsmalcers on \"Television Hill\" and the possibility<br />\nof financing two games, plus publicity chaos; places the game where<br />\nit belongs, at Hopkins.<br />\nThe following are the special procedures installed for the benefit<br />\nof students, alumni, peace &amp; order and Hopkins' \"Rent-a-Cops\":<br />\nBoth gates will be open from 12:15 to 1:15 for: Students with<br />\nJHU 1.D. cards and one guest or family unit; full time faculty with<br />\nlibrary I.D. which will also admit his family.

At 1:15 regular admission procedures will begin:<br />\nwill those waiting please lineup in the roadway between the two<br />\ngates.

But, report Jay scouts, the<br />\nMiddies have found themselves in<br />\nrecent victories over Virginia<br />\n(12-6) and the Carling (formerly<br />\nUniversity) Club (9-7), and appear<br />\nready to pose a definite roadblock<br />\nto Hopkins' title aspirations.<br />\nWhatever Navy's prowess relative to past Annapolis clubs, the<br />\nteam's individual strengths - - good<br />\nteam defense, general athletic<br />\nability,and speed - - are hardly un-<br /><br />\nfamiliar to long-time observers of<br />\nthe Middies; and the close defense<br />\nand midfields possess these qualities to a pronounced degree.
