In either case an unhealthy<br />\nattitude has been bred which leads to acts of vandalism,<br />\nsuch as the \"shame\", by disturbed students.<br />\nIn attacking the present Hopkins policy of accepting<br />\nclassified Army contracts on germ and chemical warfare, we wish to clarify the point that it is not a moral<br />\nquestion. Issues can not be decided on the high plains of<br />\nmorality to anyone's satisfaction. We view the problem<br />\npragmatically. There is a contradiction involved when a<br />\nfree, private university takes on secret Army research<br />\ncontracts in biological warfare research. So far we have<br />\nreceived unsatisfactory answers to the questions of<br />\nwhether Hopkins can find something more constructive<br />\nto do, and whether secret research is beneficial to the<br />\nacademic community or to the public.<br />\nThe plans for a disruption of the game Saturday<br />\nto protest secret germ and chemical warfare research<br />\nat Hopkins will undoubtedly bring attention to the problem. We feel that the protest would be justified as a<br />\ngesture to the administration that their backhand whitewash of the entire episode did not satisfy the concerned<br />\nstudents of Hopkins.<br />\nWe use the modifier \"concerned\" to distinguish between tile handful of campus activists and establishment<br />\nBMOCs, and the great gray mass of prematurely middleaged students at Hopkins. This unresponsive mass of<br />\nprimeaval jelly is not going to be exhorted to rise up<br />\nagainst germ and chemical warfare research, for they<br />\nmay be of a different opinion on the subject. Instead we<br />\nexhort the great gray mass to at least respond in some<br />\nway to the issues that swirl around them. The selfish<br />\napathy they practice can only bring them contempt and<br />\nlead them to the attitude of \"not getting involved.\"<br />\nThis publication has constantly striven to elicit<br />\nreaction from its readers, either pro or con. We often<br />\njudge the worth of any article by the number of angry<br />\nletters we receive. We have worked to create an atmosphere of passive anarchy, where voices from all sides<br />\ncan bring about an understanding on any given issue.<br />\nApathy is not ignorance of Student Council elections, but<br />\nrather the disregard of issues of a wider scope.<br />\nWhy care? Because if one limits his interests only<br />\nto getting a degree, the final product will be defective.<br />\nLosing touch with the world and with other people<br />\ncreates only a generation of hollow men. What is needed<br />\nhere is a little existential virtue to drive the living dead<br />\nof Hopkins into some sort of commitment that will enrich both themselves and the community.<br />\nTired of committee action and concensus decisions,<br />\nthis activist group that is disturbed by germ and chemical warfare is taking a direct approach to the problem.<br />\nIn this we commend the group of faculty, graduates,<br />\nand undergraduates in their protest.<br />\nThe subject of secret bacteriological research at<br />\nHopkins should bring a rise out of everybody, because it<br />\nultimately concerns everyone. The Department of Pathology at the Medical Institutions has taken a contract to do<br />\nresearch on a peculiar weapons system for the Army.<br />\nIsn't there something else that could be done at those<br />\nlabs? Why keep the research secret at an educational<br />\ninstitutional which searches for the \"truth\"? Does Hopkins have to place its integrity on the line by accepting<br />\n$80,000,000 in Government contracts, or can the money<br />\nbe elicited from one of the private research underwriters? These are questions which the administration<br />\nhas failed to answer, anti which most students have failed<br />\nto ask.<br />\nWe urge the administration to take notice of the<br />\nfeeling of anxiety among students concerning secret<br />\ngerm and chemical warfare,research and to take positive<br />\nmeasures in remoigng the shrouded figure of secrecy<br />\nfrom Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nBy ELIA KATZ<br />\nWhat's this?

Knowledge<br />\nand opinions are the only things<br />\nwe're here for. They are what<br />\nmake Hopkins a University as<br />\nopposed to a subterranian military installation.

The nature of<br />\nthe research is not known (vague<br />\naccusations that they make bugs<br />\nare met by vaguenesses that drift<br />\ndown to us and say the bugs are<br />\n\"defensive,\" etc. Meaningless) but<br />\nthe nature of the research is not<br />\neven at issue.

Which is not to say that<br />\nthe blues has been taken over by<br />\nthe white folks or the white<br />\nNegro. The creativity evinced<br />\nby the Chicago based blues people e.g. Junior Wells, plus the<br />\nFolkways recordings of original<br />\nversions of singers like Bessie<br />\nSmith and Ma Rainey denote an<br />\nupsurge in interest in and performance of the blues. But the<br />\nChicago scene is still working in<br />\nbasically a pure blues idiom<br />\nwhile people like the Blues<br />\nBreakers, the Blues Project, and<br />\nPaul Butterfield have adapted<br />\nthe blues to rock.

Their own material<br />\ntends to be redundant sparkling<br />\nonly in a Mayall-Clapton number called \"Double Crossing<br />\nTime\". On the other hand the<br />\nimprovisation with the organ<br />\nand drums in Ray Charles'<br />\n\"What'd I Say\" is superb. Mayall's rendition of \"Another Man\"<br />\nIs brilliant rivaling the chants<br />\nof Blind Willie Johnson. While<br />\nthe Breakers take a lot of listening to, to really understand, they<br />\nare undoubtedly the best blues<br />\ngroup in England and could hold<br />\ntheir own with America's best.<br />\nThe Blues Project is another<br />\nstory. They have come in for a<br />\ngood deal of technical criticism,<br />\nbeing charged with virtuosity<br />\nfor virtuosity's sake and general<br />\nmusical incoherence. And they<br />\naren't good singers. Yet they are<br />\nundeniably one of America's<br />\nmost inventive, diversified groups.<br />\nTheir first recording is strongly<br />\nakin to the Breakers though less<br />\nbluesy, more rocky. And while<br />\nsometimes very fine as in \"Jelly<br />\nJelly Blues\" they tend to pall<br />\nafter a while each song sounding the same. Such is not the<br />\ncase however in Projections their<br />\nsecond album. The material is<br />\nfantastically eclectic ranging<br />\nfrom Blind Willie Johnson's<br />\nclassic \"I Can't Keep From Crying\" to Chuck Berry and Muddy<br />\nWaters to raga and folk rock.<br />\nAny group trying to do all this<br />\nis bound to have some disasters.<br />\nAnd their rendition of \"Two<br />\nTrains Running\" is not up to<br />\nMuddy's level nor is their rendition of \"You Can't Catch Me\"<br />\necual with that. of the Rollina<br />\n<br />\nStones. But it would not be going too far, to say that in<br />\n\"Steve's Song\" and \"Flute<br />\nThing\" the Project has mapped<br />\nout an idiom all its own. The<br />\nbest adjective for these songs<br />\nis classical; they are slow, graceful, very lyrical. Yet they are<br />\nextremely contemporary not<br />\nfinger exercises but viable explorations in an uncharted vein.<br />\nProjections is decidedly worth a<br />\nlistening to if for nothing else<br />\nthan these two songs.<br />\nMojo<br />\nThe Paul Butterfield Blues<br />\nBand is probably the best known<br />\nof the groups reviewed here.<br />\nButterfield is a Chicagoan and<br />\nhas evolved a style of the blues<br />\nall his own yet like the Chicago<br />\nblues at once urban in mood and<br />\ndown Southish.

Butterfield's group is unassailably the tap urban blues<br />\ngroup in America. Yet some<br />\nquestions remain unanswered.<br />\nSimply there is a question of<br />\nhow meaningful electric blues<br />\ncan be as a musical style neither<br />\nreal blues nor rock 'n roll. The<br />\nuse of a limited number of electric instruments modifies a<br />\nsound (as the Beatles have realized), in the case of the blues<br />\nit can cripple it.

Grauer<br />\nDennis A. &amp;slits<br /><br />\nShame On Barton<br />\nThe word \"shame\" was etched into the brick facade<br />\nHall this past week. We deplore this action of<br />\nBarton<br />\nof<br />\nvandalism because it is a malicious destruction of private property and because it is an ineffective avenue for<br />\nargument. But we also sympathize with the frustration<br />\nand anger that apparently prompted the act.<br />\nAlthough directed to the wrong quarters, it is obvious that some students are sickened at the thought<br />\nthat Hopkins is carrying on germ and chemical warfare<br />\nresearch for the Government. Or perhaps the action was<br />\naimed against the secrecy that surrounds both the Barton<br />\nHall physics research and the Medical Institutions bacterological warfare research. In either case an unhealthy<br />\nattitude has been bred which leads to acts of vandalism,<br />\nsuch as the \"shame\", by disturbed students.<br />\nIn attacking the present Hopkins policy of accepting<br />\nclassified Army contracts on germ and chemical warfare, we wish to clarify the point that it is not a moral<br />\nquestion. Issues can not be decided on the high plains of<br />\nmorality to anyone's satisfaction. We view the problem<br />\npragmatically. There is a contradiction involved when a<br />\nfree, private university takes on secret Army research<br />\ncontracts in biological warfare research. So far we have<br />\nreceived unsatisfactory answers to the questions of<br />\nwhether Hopkins can find something more constructive<br />\nto do, and whether secret research is beneficial to the<br />\nacademic community or to the public.<br />\nThe plans for a disruption of the game Saturday<br />\nto protest secret germ and chemical warfare research<br />\nat Hopkins will undoubtedly bring attention to the problem. We feel that the protest would be justified as a<br />\ngesture to the administration that their backhand whitewash of the entire episode did not satisfy the concerned<br />\nstudents of Hopkins.<br />\nWe use the modifier \"concerned\" to distinguish between tile handful of campus activists and establishment<br />\nBMOCs, and the great gray mass of prematurely middleaged students at Hopkins. This unresponsive mass of<br />\nprimeaval jelly is not going to be exhorted to rise up<br />\nagainst germ and chemical warfare research, for they<br />\nmay be of a different opinion on the subject. Instead we<br />\nexhort the great gray mass to at least respond in some<br />\nway to the issues that swirl around them. The selfish<br />\napathy they practice can only bring them contempt and<br />\nlead them to the attitude of \"not getting involved.\"<br />\nThis publication has constantly striven to elicit<br />\nreaction from its readers, either pro or con. We often<br />\njudge the worth of any article by the number of angry<br />\nletters we receive. We have worked to create an atmosphere of passive anarchy, where voices from all sides<br />\ncan bring about an understanding on any given issue.<br />\nApathy is not ignorance of Student Council elections, but<br />\nrather the disregard of issues of a wider scope.<br />\nWhy care? Because if one limits his interests only<br />\nto getting a degree, the final product will be defective.<br />\nLosing touch with the world and with other people<br />\ncreates only a generation of hollow men. What is needed<br />\nhere is a little existential virtue to drive the living dead<br />\nof Hopkins into some sort of commitment that will enrich both themselves and the community.<br />\nTired of committee action and concensus decisions,<br />\nthis activist group that is disturbed by germ and chemical warfare is taking a direct approach to the problem.<br />\nIn this we commend the group of faculty, graduates,<br />\nand undergraduates in their protest.<br />\nThe subject of secret bacteriological research at<br />\nHopkins should bring a rise out of everybody, because it<br />\nultimately concerns everyone. The Department of Pathology at the Medical Institutions has taken a contract to do<br />\nresearch on a peculiar weapons system for the Army.<br />\nIsn't there something else that could be done at those<br />\nlabs? Why keep the research secret at an educational<br />\ninstitutional which searches for the \"truth\"? Does Hopkins have to place its integrity on the line by accepting<br />\n$80,000,000 in Government contracts, or can the money<br />\nbe elicited from one of the private research underwriters? These are questions which the administration<br />\nhas failed to answer, anti which most students have failed<br />\nto ask.<br />\nWe urge the administration to take notice of the<br />\nfeeling of anxiety among students concerning secret<br />\ngerm and chemical warfare,research and to take positive<br />\nmeasures in remoigng the shrouded figure of secrecy<br />\nfrom Hopkins.<br /><br />\nBy ELIA KATZ<br />\nWhat's this? SHAME? Does<br />\nsomeone in the corpulent intellectual organism that is Hopkins<br />\nfeel SHAME about something?<br />\nAbout what? Can't think of a<br />\nthing, and yet somebody has<br />\nwritten SHAME in big painted<br />\nletters on Barton Hall. (As I am<br />\nwriting about it, there are eleven<br />\nmen in coveralls scraping the<br />\nSHAME off\u2014it being 10:00 now<br />\nand they having started at 7:00).<br />\nMaybe someone wants to get a<br />\nmessage to us about the place.<br />\nCan't tell.<br />\nBut if he is, he is not so very<br />\nyvrong. Because Barton Hall, no<br />\nmatter what they do there, or<br />\nfor what purpose, is the appropriate brick symbol on campus for<br />\nthe placement of contradictory<br />\npaint symbols. The building being silence and the SHAME (0!<br />\nthe uncouthness of writing on a<br />\nwall\u2014better you should have<br />\ntiied to talk to it, vandal!) being<br />\na scream. So that would be a<br />\ngood place to go to put a message<br />\non a wall, if that's what you<br />\nwanted to do. And he did.<br />\nSHAME?<br />\nWhat in God's name is he<br />\naSHAMEd about? We don't know.<br />\nCan't be certain. Can only surmise. Don't even really give a<br />\ndamn. We can only use that word<br />\n(Right about now the men in<br />\ncoveralls have succeeded in cut-<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAY 12, 1967<br /><br />\nting the word down to an ambiguous SHAM, with only the<br />\nimplications of an E.) as a convenient occasion for the examination of our own (and please don't<br />\ndo it if you don't want\u2014please<br />\ndon't if you have a lot of studying or something) our own<br />\nSHAME. What we\u2014the rest of<br />\nus\u2014have to be aSHAMEd about<br />\nis not at all ambiguous.<br />\nIt comes down to this:<br />\nThat there is secret research<br />\n(the nature of this research may<br />\nbe objectionable to some and<br />\nadmirable to others\u2014no matter)<br />\non our campus. That the Johns<br />\nHopkins University should be, as<br />\nare all great places of teaching<br />\nand learning, committed to the<br />\ndissemination, not the subversion, of knowledge. Knowledge<br />\nand opinions are the only things<br />\nwe're here for. They are what<br />\nmake Hopkins a University as<br />\nopposed to a subterranian military installation. All of which<br />\nmeans that whatever goes on at<br />\nHopkins is public, buddy. It is<br />\ncommunity property. And anything they do here that they keep<br />\nsecret they ought to stop doing.<br />\nTake it away. It is a perversion<br />\nof academia.

Which is not to say that<br />\nthe blues has been taken over by<br />\nthe white folks or the white<br />\nNegro. The creativity evinced<br />\nby the Chicago based blues people e.g. Junior Wells, plus the<br />\nFolkways recordings of original<br />\nversions of singers like Bessie<br />\nSmith and Ma Rainey denote an<br />\nupsurge in interest in and performance of the blues. But the<br />\nChicago scene is still working in<br />\nbasically a pure blues idiom<br />\nwhile people like the Blues<br />\nBreakers, the Blues Project, and<br />\nPaul Butterfield have adapted<br />\nthe blues to rock. And not only<br />\nare these groups composed of<br />\nwhite men, they are Jewish in<br />\nthe last two cases and English in<br />\nthe former.

On the other hand the<br />\nimprovisation with the organ<br />\nand drums in Ray Charles'<br />\n\"What'd I Say\" is superb. Mayall's rendition of \"Another Man\"<br />\nIs brilliant rivaling the chants<br />\nof Blind Willie Johnson. While<br />\nthe Breakers take a lot of listening to, to really understand, they<br />\nare undoubtedly the best blues<br />\ngroup in England and could hold<br />\ntheir own with America's best.<br />\nThe Blues Project is another<br />\nstory. They have come in for a<br />\ngood deal of technical criticism,<br />\nbeing charged with virtuosity<br />\nfor virtuosity's sake and general<br />\nmusical incoherence. And they<br />\naren't good singers. Yet they are<br />\nundeniably one of America's<br />\nmost inventive, diversified groups.<br />\nTheir first recording is strongly<br />\nakin to the Breakers though less<br />\nbluesy, more rocky. And while<br />\nsometimes very fine as in \"Jelly<br />\nJelly Blues\" they tend to pall<br />\nafter a while each song sounding the same. Such is not the<br />\ncase however in Projections their<br />\nsecond album. The material is<br />\nfantastically eclectic ranging<br />\nfrom Blind Willie Johnson's<br />\nclassic \"I Can't Keep From Crying\" to Chuck Berry and Muddy<br />\nWaters to raga and folk rock.<br />\nAny group trying to do all this<br />\nis bound to have some disasters.<br />\nAnd their rendition of \"Two<br />\nTrains Running\" is not up to<br />\nMuddy's level nor is their rendition of \"You Can't Catch Me\"<br />\necual with that. of the Rollina<br /><br />\nStones. But it would not be going too far, to say that in<br />\n\"Steve's Song\" and \"Flute<br />\nThing\" the Project has mapped<br />\nout an idiom all its own. The<br />\nbest adjective for these songs<br />\nis classical; they are slow, graceful, very lyrical. Yet they are<br />\nextremely contemporary not<br />\nfinger exercises but viable explorations in an uncharted vein.<br />\nProjections is decidedly worth a<br />\nlistening to if for nothing else<br />\nthan these two songs.<br />\nMojo<br />\nThe Paul Butterfield Blues<br />\nBand is probably the best known<br />\nof the groups reviewed here.<br />\nButterfield is a Chicagoan and<br />\nhas evolved a style of the blues<br />\nall his own yet like the Chicago<br />\nblues at once urban in mood and<br />\ndown Southish.

Butterfield's group is unassailably the tap urban blues<br />\ngroup in America. Yet some<br />\nquestions remain unanswered.<br />\nSimply there is a question of<br />\nhow meaningful electric blues<br />\ncan be as a musical style neither<br />\nreal blues nor rock 'n roll. The<br />\nuse of a limited number of electric instruments modifies a<br />\nsound (as the Beatles have realized), in the case of the blues<br />\nit can cripple it. Seemingly the<br />\nanswer lies in the direction of<br />\nboth Butterfield and the Breakers with their forthright professionalism and deep rapport<br />\nwith the music and that of the<br />\nBlues Project with their own<br />\nproducts out of old blues. \"If<br />\nsome one ask you who sang this<br />\nRana.\"<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MAY 12, 1967<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\nea4.4eirefridence<br />\nand all routes have undesirable criminal things are not being<br />\nR&amp;D on BW<br />\naspects.

Before the staircase people were forced willy-nilly<br />\nto live out their lives on the ground floor, and many grew<br />\ncross as bears. Especially Demosthenes who was elected<br />\nConsul of Athens six times but never served because he<br />\nwas unable to get up to the office of the Commissioner of<br />\nOaths on the third floor to be sworn in. But after Mnemon's<br />\nstaircase, Demosthenes got to the third floor easy as pie<br />\n\u2014to Athens' sorrow, as it turned out. Demosthenes, his<br />\ntemper shortened by years of confinement to the ground<br />\nfloor, soon embroiled his countrymen in a series of senseless wars with the Medes, the Persians, and the Los<br />\nAngeles Rams.
