That just 15<br />\nyears ago in this city black people were not allowed to sleep<br />\nin the \"best\" hotels or eat in the \"best\" restaurants is an<br />\nhistorical reality which almost defies comprehension. The<br />\nexperiences Abernathy recalled--beatings; the burning of his<br />\nhouse, 42 arrests--are also chilling. But Abernathy, whether<br />\nhe likes it or not, is now a successful man. As Symposium<br />\nChairperson Becker pointed out in his introduction, \"the<br />\ncareer of the Reverend Ralph Abernathy is the history of<br />\nthe black movement.\"<br />\nAlthough there are still far too many bigoted people<br />\naround in this country, the times have definitely changed.<br />\nIll the words of Reverend Abernathy, \"the SCLC has moved<br />\nfrom page 1 of our papers to page 21, or not at all.\"This<br />\nsays something about newspapers, but it says something<br />\neven more important about our society.<br />\nEugene McCarthy provided a different kind of<br />\nretrospective Wednesday.

In<br />\nthis device, an ionization<br />\ndetector utilizes a radioactive<br />\nsource, as an essential component<br />\nfor its operation.<br />\nAccording to Honeywell<br />\nofficials, the unit contains 4.4<br />\nmicrocuries of Americium-241, an<br />\nelement closely related to<br />\nplutonium and radium. Exposure<br />\nto the full force of this radiation<br />\nwould be fatal, according to<br />\nFederal guidelines concerning<br />\ntolerance levers for Americium<br />\nradiation. Such exposure could<br />\nresult from actually touching the<br />\nsubstance physically, or from<br />\nbeing in close proximity to it for<br />\na n extended period of time.<br />\nThe manufacturer says that<br />\nthe units are safe and the<br />\nUniversity agrees. In order to be<br />\nfair it should also be mentioned<br />\nthat the Nuclear Regulatory<br />\nCommission (NRC) has also<br />\nconcluded-- for now--that these<br />\nunits are benign. Although many<br />\nclaims that these detectors are<br />\nharmless prevail, the potential for<br />\ndisaster is still a concern. (With<br />\nall due respect, neither the<br />\nscientists at the NRC nor the<br />\nAdministrators here are even<br />\nclosely related to God)<br />\nPoliticks and Other Human<br />\nInterests in a January 31, 1978<br />\narticle states that : \"The NRC<br />\nbased its decision to license<br />\nionization smoke detectors upon<br />\ntests commissioned by the<br />\nmanufacturers\". This is an apparent<br />\nconflict of interests.<br />\nLet us grant that radiation<br />\nnormally emitted from our<br />\ndetectors is considered minimal<br />\nand below today's accepted<br />\nsafety levels. Will they be beloW<br />\ntomorrows? In the '50's nothing<br />\nwas thought of fluoroscoping<br />\n<br />\n(x-rays forming an image by<br />\nprojection onto a fluorescent<br />\nscreen) children's feet to see if<br />\ntheir shoes fit properly. Many of<br />\nthese children later developed<br />\nmalformed feet. In the early '60's<br />\nindividuals were treated for acne<br />\nwith radiation and now these<br />\npeople suffer abnormally high<br />\nrates of skin cancer. These<br />\npractices were within safety<br />\nlimits then, but have proven<br />\ncatastrophic. Are we to suppose<br />\n<br />\nwill affect your detector,<br />\nespecially if it bears some hidden<br />\ndefect. Admittedly this is a<br />\nremote possibility, but must you<br />\nbe made to take the risk.<br />\nAnother problem exists even if<br />\nyour unit is functioning perfectly<br />\nand is apparently harmless. When<br />\nthere is a fire your detector<br />\nshould sound off and warn you<br />\nto leave. Unfortunately, the<br />\ntechnical marvel that just raised<br />\nthe alarm will remain behind and<br />\n<br />\nthat in 1978 we have attained<br />\nultimate wisdom? Must we be<br />\nforced to tolerate excess<br />\nradiation regardless of the<br />\namount? Nobel Laureate Linus<br />\nPauling has been quoted by the<br />\nAugust 1977 issue of The<br />\nProgressive: \"The nature of high<br />\nenergy radiation and the nature<br />\nof the gene are such that genetic<br />\nmutations could occur even at<br />\nthe lowest dose rates...That is,<br />\nthere is no (safe) threshhold.\"<br />\nCan a manufacturer make<br />\nevery unit perfect? Is there such<br />\na thing as 100% quality control?<br />\nMany will sensibly acknowledge<br />\nthat this is impossible. Even if<br />\nthe previous argument as to<br />\nwhether a well-functioning unit is<br />\ncompletely harmless is ignored,<br />\nconsider this : what if the<br />\ndetector you get is the one that<br />\nwasn't made correctly and is<br />\nreleasing radioactivity?<br />\nRemember that there is enough<br />\nin one unit to seriously harm you<br />\neven if there's only partial<br />\nexposure.

Abernathy cited examples<br />\nright on the Hopkins campus of<br />\nongoing racial discrimination.<br />\nOnly three of this year's Medical<br />\nSchool freshmen are black, he<br />\nsaid. Later, when told that there<br />\nare only 1 0 7 black<br />\nundergraduates at Hopkins, he<br />\nshook his head and gave the<br />\naudience a look of shame. \"You<br />\nmust do better than that.

Anyway, I came home after<br />\nsome 23 years of military service, all shot' to hell, and<br />\nwilly-nilly, they asked me to teach in the Evening College!<br />\nI've written some books, and a few volumes of verse since<br />\nthen.<br />\nQ: When were you an undergraduate?<br />\nA: Well,! graduated from Boys' Latin School in...1927.<br />\nThen, before I could wangle my old man to send me<br />\nthrough here, he said, \"I want you to go to law school.\"<br />\nHe was a lawyer, and since he had the money bags. I said,<br />\n\"Yes, Father, I'll go to law school.\" So I spent 1927 to<br />\n1930 getting a law degree in the School of Law at the<br />\nUniversity of Baltimore. That was the second class that<br />\ngraduated there. I'm intending to write a set of<br />\nverses...about the faculty there that taught me. In the<br />\nLaw School then were some of the most brilliant jurists<br />\nand members of the bar...men like Judge Walter Preston<br />\nand Philip Heiusler. I think the faculty they had then was<br />\nfar superior to what they have now.<br />\nQ: Why do you say that?<br />\nA: Well in the first place, it was very small. The faculty<br />\nworked for next to nothing, since they did it mostly to<br />\nhelp the chaps through night school. Now it's huge...I<br />\nthink they made it too big, too fast...and the faculty can't<br />\nmatch up to the great galaxy of men we had...Eugene<br />\nEtIgett...probably the greatest living authority then on the<br />\nlaw of real property...John S.T. Yost...Judge Albert<br />\nSidney Johnston Owens...<br />\nWell anyway, I go through in 1930, and told my father,<br />\n\"Well, here's my degree, but I don't want to practice, and<br />\nI still want to go to Hopkins!\" So my father said okay, go<br />\non out and enroll. He gave me thirty dollars a month and<br />\nsaid if I could make ends meet on thirty dollars a month,<br />\nthen I could go on and get my degrees...<br />\nQ: That was your allowance? Thirty dollars a month?<br />\nDid you make ends meet?<br />\nA: Yes indeed. Q: Did you work while you went to<br />\nHopkins?<br />\nA: I did some tutoring, and I kept tightening belts, but<br />\nit wasn't too bad...you see, things were cheap then.<br />\nQ: Could you get a good beer for a dime?<br />\nA: Well, not then. A good beer was fifteen cents, but<br />\nwe didn't have any beer till Saturday nights anyway. Once<br />\neach week, I and a friend from the History Department,<br />\nand another one from the Romance Languages<br />\nDepartment, and maybe one or two friends from Political<br />\nScience would all meet at a place called the Log<br />\nCabin...what is now called the Blue Jay. We would stop<br />\nwork in the evening about six on Saturday. We'd saved up<br />\naIl week, and would have two or three beers. That was<br />\nmore fun, much more fun, than it is today...<br />\nON LIFE AT HOPKINS\u2022<br />\nA: The Glass Pavilion, and both wings of Levering,<br />\n,lidn't exist then. We still had the cafeteria...the food was<br />\nI orrible.<br />\nQ: Horrible. eh? Some things never change, then?<br />\nA: I think the food here is pretty good.<br />\nA: Oh.<br />\n<br />\nAn Interview With Colonel Frederid<br />\nQ: Well...compared to what it was like back then.<br />\nQ: What was a typical meal like?<br />\nA: Whichever was the cheapest! You could get a large<br />\nbowl of stew and some bread, make a pretty decent meal<br />\nfor about forty cents.<br />\nA: When I worked at Hopkins, we had some of the<br />\ngreatest scholars this University has ever possessed. Men<br />\nlike Tenney Frank, David Moore Robinson, Kent Roberts<br />\nGreenfield, Frederic Chopin Lane...oh, and Jacob<br />\nHollander!...his portrait is up there in his great red robes<br />\nin the Main Entrance Room of Gilman Hall...one went to<br />\nhim for Political Economy.<br />\nDr. Frederic Lane was the great scholar that ran the<br />\nentire undergraduate history department...History 'A' and<br />\n`B'... Q: What was History A and B?<br />\nA: History A began at the close of the Roman Empire,<br />\nand came up to the Middle Ages. History B picked it up at<br />\nthe Middle Ages and brought it up to World War One.<br />\nThen there were those awful things called `surveys'...<br />\nQ: Surveys?<br />\nA: No way you could avoid em!...in the sense that the<br />\nfields were so broad, you just couldn't. We had to go so<br />\nfast, cover century after century. Well, Dr. Lane...truly a<br />\nremarkable man, I don't know how many books he's<br />\npublished...gosh, lie must be in his middle eighties by<br />\nnow. Well, one of his great books was on his specialty,<br />\nwhich was Venice in the period of the great shipping era.<br />\nWell, the book, which was widely acclaimed among the<br />\nscholarly world, had the unfortunate title of Venetian<br />\nShips and Shipping. You can very well imagine what the<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate students called the<br />\nbook!...that was a stock joke among the undergraduates<br />\nfor many years...<br />\nThe little tiny bits and things like that I had all jotted<br />\ndown in my notebooks, of course...<br />\nTHE TIMES OF DISCONTENT:<br />\nA: Do you remember when they had that hideous<br />\nphenomena called the 'Bonus March?' All those so-called<br />\nveterans of World War One were trying to force the<br />\nCongress to pass a free handout, a great big bonus, just<br />\nbecause they had served in the Army. Congress was very<br />\nmuch divided, but they inevitably yielded, as politicians<br />\nalways do, because they had to think about the votes, and<br />\nso they passed the damn thing. Herbert Hoover vetoed it,<br />\nand oh my God, there was the damndest .explosion! I<br />\nforget the man's name who led this march of six or 'seven<br />\nthousand of these men...and they all just walked into<br />\nWashington and set up a perfectly ghastly encampment<br />\ndown on the Anacostia flats. They just squatted<br />\nthere...there were no sanitary provisions and the place<br />\nbegan to stink. They were panhandling all over the city,<br />\nbegging money for food, and used to make little<br />\ncampfires to cook soup. It was perfectly shocking. Well,<br />\nfinally, Mr. Hoover told the leader that he would not<br />\ntolerate the discriminatory legislation; that there was no<br />\nmore reason that the Veterans should have a great big<br />\nhuge free handout than somebody who had taken ill in<br />\ngovernment service, and that half of the men had not even<br />\nseen a shot fired...<br />\nWell, that got them good and mad, and they began to<br />\nriot, which polished things off. General Douglas<br />\nMacArthur, Chief of Staff of the Army, who was the<br />\nbiggest egomaniac on Earth, was called in with the Ft.<br />\nMyer Garrison and told to burn the place down. I was in<br />\nWashington at the time, and I saw it...<br />\nMacArthur's troops went down there to carry out the<br />\nPresident's orders, but first they offered to help these<br />\nmen and sent down a rolling kitchen to feed them...and<br />\n'then told them to go home. But they refused to<br />\nbudge...just squatted. So MacArthur rode in on a white<br />\nhorse...my God, I couldn't see how he could raise his left<br />\nhand; he had medals hanging down to his belly<br />\nbutton...with his whole battalion of the Third (Regular)<br />\nU.S. Infantry behind him with fixed bayonets. The<br />\ncommander of the battalion said to the squatters, \"Men,<br />\nyou must leave on the President's orders! I'm ordered to<br />\ndestroy this rat's nest of disease and potential cause of<br />\nepidemic. The water you're drinking isn't fit to drink and<br />\nyou're contaminating everything.\" Well, they all hissed<br />\nand booed and yelled. The commander gave an order to<br />\nthe troops to fan out and present bayonets and advance.<br />\nWell, some of the buggers stood, but the rest of them<br />\nstarted to run like hell...<br />\n<br />\nby Adam L.<br />\nON GRADUATE LIFE:<br />\n<br />\nth<br />\n\"I(<br />\n<br />\nQ: What did you do your dissertation on?<br />\nA: A history of Aeronautic Operations in the American<br />\nCivil War.<br />\nQ: You mean dirigibles?<br />\nA: No, they were captive observation balloons. It was a<br />\nvery highly-organized thing that was disbanded in<br />\n1863...You know, it's interesting; the dissertation won<br />\nthe Mrs. Simon Baruch University Award--a thousand cold<br />\nbucks--for the best doctoral dissertation on the Civil War<br />\nor Southern History. Now, Mrs. Simon Baruch was the<br />\nmother of the great Bernard Baruch, (President<br />\nRoosevelt's personal advisor), and also is the grandmother<br />\nof Mrs. Barbara Tuchrnan, who wrote the Guns of<br />\nAugust...<br />\nQ: Do you think students and teachers are<br />\nbecoming too specialized?<br />\n<br />\nA: Well,<br />\ndon't know enough about how the<br />\ncurriculum operates now, but my own idea of the ideal is<br />\na solid, broad background. I don't see how it's possible to<br />\nqualify for graduate status in a department without being<br />\nwell-versed in general background...<br />\nOne of the most beautiful associations I ever had<br />\nwas conferring on my dissertation with Dr. Ella Lonn. She<br />\nwas the head of the History Department at Goucher<br />\nCollege.<br />\nQ: When was this?<br />\nA: I'd say about 1936 to 1940. She had been the great<br />\nspecialist in the Civil War...she's written about seven<br />\nbooks; she's dead now. When I received my mobilization<br />\norders, she had already reviewed chapter after chapter of<br />\nmy dissertation...she made suggestions, improvements,<br />\nwhat not...I went down to see her one day, and I told her<br />\nthat I was leaving. The first volume of my work had just<br />\nbeen published and the second was in progress. I told her<br />\n<br />\nsai<br />\nfo<br />\nan<br />\nso<br />\nco<br />\nan<br />\nan<br />\nact<br />\nco<br />\nba<br />\nlat<br />\nto<br />\nph<br />\nPr<br />\n<br />\npic<br />\npic<br />\nan:<br />\nho<br />\nan<br />\nint<br />\nCo<br />\ncol<br />\nha<br />\nno<br />\n<br />\nyo<br />\n<br />\n\fJ\"i'l THE WAY 'Willy', WERE<br />\n<br />\nrick Stansbury Haydon 0.B.E., M.C.<br />\nL.

Finish the second volume<br />\nfor me by all means.\" Well, the old lady burst into tears<br />\nand said, \"Oh, you'll come back!\" and I certainly hoped<br />\nso! But she ended up by promising me that if I didn't<br />\ncome back, that she would do it. I took everything I had<br />\nand stored it in a special room in the Library of Congress,<br />\nand wrote out a legal paper giving her the right to have<br />\naccess the moment the casualty lists showed that I wasn't<br />\ncoming home...Obviously it happened that I did come<br />\nback, and we had quite a celebration! Then a few years<br />\nlater the poor old lady died.<br />\nShe was a perfectly wonderful character.. I've been out<br />\nto Goucher several times and asked for portrait<br />\nphotographs of Dr. Gallagher, who had been her<br />\nPredecessor, and Dr. Lonn.

I reported to Headquarters in London, and they<br />\nshipped me right on up to Glasgow. We all went aboard<br />\ntroop ships...the men on board were mostly British. You<br />\nsee, the British really ran that thing; they had a big field<br />\narmy, the First British Army. The Americans had only<br />\none division, the First U.S. Infantry Division, and some<br />\ncorps artillery. I was attached to the British Forces, to<br />\nserve as American Liaison Officer in the HQ of the Fifth<br />\nBritish Corps, and later with the British 47th<br />\n(\"Battle-Axe\")Infantry Division.<br />\nWell, hardly had we landed when Rommel was caught<br />\nin a nutcracker, between Montgomery's troops to the<br />\nSouth, and us to the North. Rommel stopped them at the<br />\nMareth line, though...They couldn't go around it, and<br />\nthey couldn't break through it.<br />\nThe Germans brought in this old bugger named Jurgen<br />\nvon Arnim, a very aristocratic man that came from the<br />\nPrussian military families who claimed descent from the<br />\nTeutonic Knights. He took over the Northern armies<br />\nwhile Rommel was fighting off the English, but they<br />\nstopped us, being heavily reinforced. The terrain and<br />\nnumbers being what they were, we only had this one little<br />\ndamn mountain road for supply, because we didn't have<br />\nenough airplanes to supply by air. As a result, half the<br />\ntime we were half-starved! Well, finally, we got in the<br />\nThird and Thirty-Fourth U.S. Infantry Divisions, and that<br />\ngave us a Corps, and a lot more artillery. We finally broke<br />\nthrough and Montgomery did also.<br />\nRommel got the hell north as fast as he could to<br />\ncombine forces with von Arnim, and we boxed them into<br />\nthe Tunisian Cape. Rommel deserted his troops, probably<br />\nunder Hitler's orders, hopped a plane and got back to<br />\nGermany. Meanwhile, von Arnim, nasty as he was, stood<br />\nand fought as best he could.<br />\nA: Von Arnim, of course, decided that he just had<br />\nto surrender, and there was this great joke about him...He<br />\nhad broadcast back to Germany and to the world that the<br />\nGerman Army would fight to the last cartridge...and when<br />\nthey did surrender, he pretended that they had run out of<br />\nammunition. When he went to surrender, he had dressed<br />\nhimself up in this perfectly incredible uniform; he had<br />\nenough medals on him to sink a boat! He made the<br />\nmistake of wearing a gold belt with a Nazi dagger on it,<br />\nhowever...all high German officers wore them.<br />\nAs luck would have it, von Arnim was captured by<br />\ntroops of Australian/New Zealand Army Corps, the<br />\nANZAC. They were commanded by a really rugged old<br />\nman by the name of Kippenberger, an Australian. He<br />\nhated the Nazis, of course, but Kippenberger was just as<br />\nsimple as a cobbler's shoe, and von Arnim came into his<br />\ntent with full army dress.I think von Arnim expected<br />\nKippenberger to stand up and salute him! It shows you<br />\nthe arrogance of the man...Well, Kippenberger took one<br />\nlook at him, turned to the sentries, and growled,\"Haven't<br />\nI decided I'm not going to have any of these Nazis enter<br />\nmy tent armed? Take that person out and strip that damn<br />\ndagger off him!\" So the sent prodded von Arnim with<br />\nthe butt of his rifle, and von Arnim had the whole damn<br />\narrogance just kicked out of him...it was like watching a<br />\nballoon deflate. The sentry came in with the dagger and<br />\nsaid, \"Here it is, sir.\" Kippenberger said,\"Throw it in the<br />\nwaste basket.\"<br />\n...When Kippenberger was done questioning him, he<br />\ndidn't even say goodbye. He just said, \"Take this prisoner<br />\nback to the cage and throw him in there with the rest of<br />\nthem.\"...<br />\nA: The General that commanded the Afrika Korps,<br />\non the other hand, was a much gentler man by the name<br />\nof von Thoma\". He was, I believe, a Bavarian, much more<br />\ncivilized than the Prussians. When they captured the<br />\nGerman force, the Italians had all run away...two divisions<br />\nof them...so the Afrika Korps was captured. Von Thoma<br />\nput on his dress uniform, waited by his tank, and waving<br />\nthe first British tank that went by, called it over, and<br />\noffered his sword! Well, the tank commander was just a<br />\nsecond lieutenant, and he'd realized that he had just<br />\nbagged a full general, the..commander of the entire Afrika<br />\nKorps...<br />\nMontgomery wouldn't let von Thoma be put in prison<br />\nat all. He invited von Thoma to dinner, his orderly was<br />\nordered to give him a bath, they drank whiskey & sodas,<br />\nhad wine with the dinner, and had a jolly good time!...<br />\n<br />\nQ: Did you see General Montgomery?<br />\nA: Yes, he was quite an amazing person--of course, he<br />\nhad that frightful row with George Patton.<br />\nQ: Did you see George Patton too?<br />\nA: Oh, God yes, I served under him. He was a<br />\nwonderful person,General Patton.<br />\nQ: Most people think of him as a tough soldier who<br />\ndidn't like to take orders.<br />\nA: They didn't know him. Oh, he put on all that<br />\ngrandstand play-acting. The troops thought the world of<br />\nhim. Did you ever hear of the time he challenged<br />\nRommel? Patton got into an ordinary Sherman tank, got<br />\nhis driver to take him out to the front lines and carried<br />\nalong with him a.bilingual interpreter who spoke German<br />\nand English. He knew the radio band that the Germans<br />\nwere using, so he sent a signal out on their frequency.<br />\nwhich they all heard, challenging Rommel to come out on<br />\nthe desert in any Mark tank of his choosing and 'shoot it<br />\nout!' Patton added that if he didn't, the Germans were a<br />\nbunch of goddamned cowardly bastards! Of course he<br />\nknew that Rommel wouldn't come out and fight...but<br />\nPatton gave a lift to the morale of every Allied soldier on<br />\nthe line. Two weeks later we drove them into the western<br />\nMediterranean...<br />\nQ: Could you shed some light on the lace-slapping'<br />\nincident concerning General Patton?<br />\nA: What happened was, the campaign in Sicily was<br />\nover, and Patton went around to all the field hospitals and<br />\nvisited the wounded...ordered that they be given more<br />\ncigarettes, and did everything he could to help them...the<br />\nman was soft under that shell of swashbuckling,<br />\npearl-handled pistols, and loud-mouthed blasphemies...<br />\nPatton had the burden of this campaign on his neck,<br />\nand he went to tent after tent of wounded. He went out<br />\ninto the waiting room of one of the wards of one of these<br />\nbig long hospitals, and here's this soldier sitting there<br />\nweeping and crying and carrying on, and Patton thought<br />\nhe had been wounded. So Patton sat down on his cot, and<br />\nput his arm around him, and said, \"I know, son, I know,<br />\nit hurts--we've all been hit, just buck up, and I'll get You<br />\nsome whiskey.\" Well, it turns out this soldier had never<br />\nbeen anywhere near the front...that he had run away, and<br />\nwas scared. The Provost said that if the psychiatrist didn't<br />\nfind anything wrong with him, he was going to be sent t<br />\nthe stockade. Well, then the soldier screamed and yelled<br />\nsome more, and went into a kind of hysteria. Patton<br />\nbeing a wise old chap, knew what to do...What would you<br />\ndo if you had somebody hysterical? Slap him in the face<br />\nWell, that's what he was doing, trying to stop this boy'<br />\nhysteria. So some...little first lieutenant of the Medical<br />\nCorps accused Patton of all kinds of brutality, and the<br />\nworst part was he wasn't a real doctor anyway, he was<br />\none of those quack psychiatrists. The newspaper people<br />\nwere called and there was this big row--just disgusting. All<br />\nPatton was doing was what any knowledgeable, sensible<br />\nwise officer would have done. If people had kept their<br />\nsnoots out of it he'd of slapped the soldier into the<br />\nrealization that it doesn't make any sense to get<br />\nhysterical. In fact, Patton told him,\"I'm on your side, 1'1<br />\nback you up, just stop crying!\" But of course the<br />\nnewspapers never published that. They said he'd slapped<br />\nsoldier in a hospital. Hospital? Hell, he'd never been in the<br />\nward, he didn't have a scratch on him. Well, that<br />\npractically ruined George Patton...<br />\n, If you've ever seen a bloody mess, you should have<br />\nseen Rome. There were Germans shooting at Italians,<br />\nItalians shooting at Germans, Italians shooting at<br />\nAmerican and British, Germans shooting at us, we were<br />\nshooting at them...no one knew what the hell was going<br />\non...<br />\n...Well, many more things were discussed than could<br />\nhave possibly been put in one article. The few gems<br />\nincluded here seem to me the briefest of highlights of the<br />\nentire interview, but, alas, they will have to serve. Colonel<br />\nHaydon spent 2\u00bd years in Korea, and his anecdotes about<br />\nthe war, Douglas MacArthur, General Westmoreland, the<br />\n2004th Quartermaster's Provisional Ice Cream Unit, and<br />\nmore, are omitted.<br />\nLooking back over the interview, I find that there was<br />\nreally no focal point to our conversation. It was, however,<br />\nsome of the most enjoyable two hours I've ever had<br />\ntalking with anyone. The Colonel can be found sitting<br />\ncomfortably in his little section of the library lounge, or<br />\nperhaps downing a well-deserved beer in Levering, or<br />\nsimply walking about the campus, admiring the landscape.<br />\nWherever you might find him, say hello, and be prepared<br />\nto engage in a conversation about almost anything that<br />\ninterests you. The past still lives in the mind and tongue<br />\nof Frederick Stansbury Haydon.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12 1 ATOVEMBER 3, 1978<br />\n<br />\nBakker's<br />\nBones<br />\nBY PAUL A. BERCHIELLI<br />\nFor those who toil in the dusty corners of Latrobe<br />\nHall's basement, it has become a familiar sight--but for the<br />\nuninitiated, it might just as well be a mummy or some<br />\ngiant ipifiata, if it wasn't for the telltale graffito hastily<br />\nscribbled on the top, \"Bakker's Bones.\" \"Alas,\" one asks,<br />\n\"what is it!\"<br />\nIt is, explains Dr. Robert Bakker of the Earth and<br />\nPlanetary Sciences Department, the \"right upper leg bone,<br />\nfemur, from an extremely large dinosaur, one of the<br />\nlargest found in the country.\" Weighing around 1500<br />\n2 feet, the bone was<br />\n/<br />\npounds and measuring about 61<br />\nHopkins undergraduate<br />\nformer<br />\na<br />\nactually discovered by<br />\na western expedition<br />\non<br />\nJuly<br />\nearly<br />\nin<br />\nWayne<br />\nnamed Bob<br />\norganized by Dr. Bakker for the purpose of collecting<br />\ndinosaur and other vertebrate fossils for teaching and<br />\nresearch purposes.<br />\nThe group, consisting mostly of graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students, started on June 1st to tour<br />\nthrough New Mexico and Utah carefully collecting many<br />\nmammal and other fossils before arriving at that small<br />\nbadlands hill about an hour northeast of Laramie,<br />\nWyoming, where the mother skeleton was found. The site<br />\nwhere the first weathered fragments were spotted<br />\neventually grew with the help of nine excavators into a<br />\nhuge 20 by 10-foot pit 10 feet deep which yielded many<br />\nof the dinosaur's bones.<br />\nThe bones' original owner was a camarisaurus, an<br />\nanimal estimated by Dr. Bakker to have weighed about 48<br />\ntons and which spanned 60 feet (as opposed to \"only\" 45<br />\nfeet for the huge brontosaurus). \"It looked like a<br />\nbrontosaurus except bigger, ,with ai shorter neck, and<br />\nbigger head--more robust. It was a pretty impressive<br />\nanimal,\" conceded the long-haired, bearded paleontologist<br />\nin an ironic tone. Was the animal a vegetarian, like the<br />\nbrontosaurus? \"Yes, by physiology, not by religion,\"<br />\nquipped Dr. Bakker. By radiometric dating of the<br />\nsurrounding rock, one can tell that it lived about 140<br />\nmillion years ago,\"plus or minus five.\"<br />\nRemoving and transporting the Latrobe bone was<br />\nanother affair. Most fossils, exposed to dissolved minerals<br />\nd<br />\nfor millions of years, become partly or mostly petrifie<br />\nnatural<br />\nthe<br />\nreplaces<br />\n(rock-like) as rock material slowly<br />\nbone m a tteri However, this bone was \"heavy, but<br />\nextremely brittle--if you tap it, it would shatter into a<br />\ngilfion pieces.\"(How much is a gillion? \"A gillion is ten to<br />\nthe gilth,\" retorts the ever-jocular Dr. Bakker). To protect<br />\nthe bone for transport, it had to be literally mummified:<br />\nOn site it was soaked in a special preservative, \"then<br />\nwrapped in newspaper waked in water. then burlap<br />\nsoaked with plaster.\" Two by four planks were then<br />\nstrips<br />\nplaced on the plaster and fastened by plaster-soaked<br />\nto form a protective frame.<br />\n<br />\nActual removal of the bone was perhaps the most<br />\n\"interesting\" problem of all. Dr. Bakker and students had<br />\nto dig a loading platform into the side of a hill. Then,<br />\nwith ten people pushing, the huge mummified artifact was<br />\nslowly nudged into the rear of an E & PS Department<br />\ncarry-all vehicle affectionately known as \"the great white<br />\nshark.\" Even though the nearest dirt road was eight miles<br />\naway, a graduate student managed to drive the bone back<br />\nover the two-thousand miles to its present obscure resting<br />\nplace.<br />\nEventually scheduled to be put on display at the<br />\n<br />\nMaryland Academy of Sciences Museum at the Inner<br />\nHarbor, it,along with other specimens, will provide a sort<br />\nof living display as visitors will be able to watch the<br />\nprogress of the bones as they are slowly reconstructed and<br />\nprepared at Hopkins. Comments Bakker, \"The object of<br />\nthe display is to show how bones are found, taken back to<br />\nthe lab, collected, preserved, prepared and, so on.\"<br />\nEventually, Dr. Bakker dreams of reconstructing the<br />\nwhole ,camarisaurus from latex moldings when the rest of<br />\nthe treated bones are excavated from the Wyoming site in<br />\ncont. on p. 16<br />\n<br />\nHalloween Seance<br />\nPacks In The Ectoplasm<br />\nagreed.

He introduced himself: 'Hi.<br />\nMy name is Pete: and I'll be coming on a little later.' The<br />\ncrowd, still milling among themselves, turned and<br />\nhesitated to clap as if they weren't really sure who this<br />\nperson was. He was the star of the show. Peter Gabriel<br />\nwent on to introduce the opening act, Jules and the Polar<br />\nBears, then retired backstage to wait his turn. But it was<br />\nthis frontality, this straight-forwardness with the<br />\naudience, which set the tone for his performance, which<br />\nmade the concert so great.<br />\nFor years, Gabriel was lead-singer with Genesis, and<br />\nthrough complex costumes and characters, he dramatized<br />\ntheir comPositions in concert. He left the band almost<br />\nthree years ago, and has released two solo albums in the<br />\nmeantime, but the concert last Thursday at the Lyric was<br />\npart of his first solo tour. Whereas with Genesis he always<br />\nhid behind masks, on this tour, Gabriel steps out and<br />\npresents himself in full view to his audience. The<br />\nhesitation on the part of the crowd was merely a<br />\nquestioning: 'Is that really him?'<br />\nWhen Gabriel emerged for his set, the crowd was ready,<br />\nand responded with a standing ovation. After singing a<br />\nditb to his teddy bear (his spiritual leader for twelve<br />\nyears), the concert proper began.<br />\nHe put on an orange crossing guard's vest, orange gloves<br />\nand a 'power pack' over his white pants and T-shirt. He<br />\nheld a small spot light in his hands and told the audience<br />\nhe was 'in search of the artist.' As taped music played,be<br />\nshined his spot over the audience. Spots appeared from<br />\nthe rear of the hall, and ,five people dressed identical to<br />\nGabriel began walking down the aisles of the orchestra.<br />\nThe music was blaring, the black lights on the stage<br />\nstrobed and six bright spots revolved around the hall. The<br />\nintensity of this bizarre experience heightened, then<br />\nclimaxed as Gabriel and the band broke into the first<br />\nhard-driving chords of'On The Air.'<br />\nFrom that point on, Gabriel, obviously having found<br />\nthe artist (himself), superbly performed almost all the<br />\ncompositions from his solo albums (both ironically titled<br />\nPeter Gabriel). Although some of the slower songs lagged<br />\ntowards the middle of the concert, the muscianship of<br />\nGabriel and his band (the electronics man was Larry Fast,<br />\nmastermind of Synergy) helped carry the audience<br />\nto the brilliant performances of `Solsbury Hill'<br />\nthy<br />\nlern Love' at the end. As the roadies took the,<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\nIt was the spring of 1974. The Dictators, a faceless hard<br />\nrock outfit made up of Jewish boys from the Bronx, was<br />\nplaying its usual set of songs to a handful of unreceptive<br />\nderelicts at PopeSfe's Spinach Factory, a dingy bar in<br />\nBrooklyn. Willing to try anything to spark some<br />\nenthusiasm, keyboardist and group leader Adny Shernoff<br />\ninvited roadie Richard Blum to sing lead vocals on \"Wild<br />\nThing.\" Blum, an overweight slob who had never set foot<br />\non a stage before, gladly accepted the offer.<br />\nA strange thing happened. As Blum bellowed and<br />\njumped about on stage, the drunks suddenly came to life.<br />\nHappy to see a fellow derelict in the spotlight, they began<br />\nto hoot and holler. Bottles and barstools flew. The drunks<br />\ndanced joyously as Blum gave one of the most stirring<br />\nrenditions of the Troggs' classic ever heard.<br />\nHandsome Dick Manitoba had been born.<br />\nEven with their charismatic frontman, however, the<br />\nroad to success has not been an easy one for the<br />\nDictators. Their debut album, The Dictators Go Girl<br />\nCrazy, released in 1975, failed commercially and they<br />\nwere subsequently dropped by Epic. Disillusioned, the<br />\nband members went their separate ways.<br />\nCritics raved over the record, though. With lines like \"I<br />\nthink Lou Reed is a creep\" and \"My favorite part of<br />\ngrowing up/is when I'm sick and throwing up,\" Go Girl<br />\nCrazy still remains the definitive comedy rock album.<br />\nAdny Shernofis tongue-in-cheek tributes to cars, girls,<br />\nTV, and teenage idiocy captured the hearts of many who<br />\nwere lucky enough to hear the LP, and eventually, the<br />\nband was reunited by popular demand.<br />\nA second album, Manifest Destiny, was released last<br />\nyear, and though it contained some stellar performances<br />\n(notably on \"Science Gone Too Far\" and \"Young, Fast<br />\nand Scientific\"), the overblown, Ezrinesque production<br />\nseemed inappropriate; after all, the 'Tators are a garage<br />\nband. It was apparent that the Dictators were suffering<br />\nfrom an identity crisis.<br />\nWhile in England earlier this year, Shernoff was<br />\ndevastated by the energy and uncompromising attitudes<br />\nof young bands like the Clash and Sham 69. This, he<br />\ndecided, was the direction the new Dictators were going<br />\nto take. Bassist Mark \"the Animal'.' Mendoze voiced his<br />\ndisapproval with Adny's decision and was quickly sent<br />\npacking. Along with him went his platform shoes and his<br />\nstrictly \"old wave\" ideas. Shernoff switched over to bass,<br />\nand the,stripped-down, fired-up Tators soon returned to<br />\nCont. on p. 16<br />\n<br />\nPt<br />\n<br />\nGabriel The Dictator<br />\n<br />\nstage, the concert was apparently over without Gabriel<br />\nsinging anything from his days with Genesis. Suddenly, he<br />\nshot from backstage, exchanging his vest for a leather<br />\njacket, and sang an incredibly powerful version of 'The<br />\nLamb Lies Down On Broadway' from his last album with<br />\nGenesis.<br />\nAlthough this certainly excited the Genesis fans in the<br />\naudience, perhaps the highlight of the show came earlier<br />\nwhen Gabriel, not content simply with direct<br />\ncommunication with his audience, left the stage and<br />\njoined the crowd. 'Waiting for the Big One' began<br />\ninstrumentally, and when the singing came in, Gabriel was<br />\nnot on stage. A spot caught him among the crowd, singing<br />\nin the balcony. The entire audience stood up to watch as<br />\nhe moved among the outstretched arms, going completely<br />\nacross the balcony. He then came downstairs and walked<br />\nup an aisle. People crowded to get a closer glimpse, to<br />\ntouch him or to shake his hand.<br />\nI have seen Patti Smith dancing on tables, but never<br />\nbefore have I seen a rock performer interact so directly<br />\nwith his audience. Gabriel would not settle with<br />\ndiscarding his masks and characters, presenting his music<br />\nopenly. He had to physically touch his audience and let<br />\nthein touch him.<br />\nAlso, thumbs up for the Polar Bears. Granted, Jules<br />\ncan't sing and can't play guitar, and they sound a bit like<br />\nBachman Turner Overdrive, but Jules and the Polar Bears<br />\ntake themselves so seriously and imitate so poorly the<br />\nconventions of New Wave performers that it is impossible<br />\nfor one not to laugh at them and not to feel affection for<br />\nthem. These Polar Bears may be a bit grizzily, but they<br />\nare still lovable. In the end, I can only echo Big Jim: 'It<br />\ndefinitely was a concert for cool cats.' Or cool bears as<br />\nthe case may be.<br />\n<br />\nF pter1 a i imemt<br />\n<br />\n-,tilps A Horseman<br />\n<br />\nSergiu Comissiork<br />\nThe Mon Wh-<br />\n<br />\ned<br />\n<br />\nThe Goof; Guys And The Bad Guys<br />\nWrangle In Unconventional Western<br />\nBY ROS RESNIc.:K<br />\n(WIWI is a conventional<br />\nIn many ways, Comes a<br />\n\u2022 heroism: Ella (Jane<br />\nwestern.

Apparently, she feels just as comfortable in blue<br />\njeans and a flannel shirt as she did in her street clothes in<br />\nKlute (and as in Klute , she shows kitten-like vulnerability<br />\nand tenderness).

Jason Robards, better known for<br />\nhis portrayal of Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee in All<br />\nthe President's Men, is the least convincing of the three;<br />\npartly because his role is the most demanding.

It is an<br />\nemotionally gripping tale about heroic modern America.<br />\nIt abounds in fast-paced action: cattle chases through the<br />\nforest, a barroom brawl, a fire, and a shoot-out. The<br />\nmountainous scenery provides a magically authentic<br />\n<br />\nbactdrop.

As an individual,<br />\nComissiona has achieved world-wide recognition as one of<br />\nthe great conductors of our times. In this interview, he<br />\ntalks about his life as a student in Bucharest and about<br />\nthe professional life he has maintained here in Baltimore.<br />\nThis opening segment of a two-part interview, deals with<br />\nhis musical background and the various events of his<br />\nyounger life which shaped him into the conductor--and<br />\nthe man--he is today.<br />\nWhat is your musical background and education?<br />\nI was born in Rumania, and you can guess this from my<br />\naccent. I started my musical studies in Rumania. I<br />\nenjoyed music as a kid as everyone enjoys waving their<br />\narms in front of the radio set. My dream was to become a<br />\nconductor from, the very, very beginning, so I didn't have<br />\ndreams to become a doctor or a fire brigade man or an<br />\nengineer of the locomotives. I wanted to be a conductor.<br />\nIt was clear from very early childhood. And I studied in<br />\nBucharest. The music conservatory. Violin first. I<br />\nperformed as'a violinist in small groups, playing chamber<br />\nmusic. I learned other theoretical disciplines too, but I<br />\nwas determined to become a conductor.<br />\nI started my professional life as a violinist playing with<br />\nan orchestra. At the same time, starting very seriously,<br />\nand hoping for a chance to break, to become a conductor.<br />\nThe chance was a melodramatic, romantic story. The<br />\nconductor didn't come to the performance; he was sick. It<br />\nwas an emergency. I stepped in and they liked my way. It<br />\nwas like the Sorceror's Apprentice. If you have a good<br />\nconcert, you will get two. If two good, that's four. It's a<br />\ngeometrical...progression. So to a certain extent, you<br />\nwant to stop it. But I started my career in Bucharest. Of<br />\ncourse, I also continued playing violin. I was conducting.<br />\nSo it was the break of my career.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDid you have any major mentors or musical<br />\ninfluences?<br />\nI had more than one teacher, of course. As for<br />\nconducting, I first had a very good teacher, Aedouard<br />\nLindeberg. He had a very strict form of grammar and an<br />\northodox technique. A musician of very strict discipline. I<br />\nam very grateful to him. He gave me the structure, and<br />\nthe need to be very careful with the scores. And the kind<br />\nof obligation of the professional. You always have to be<br />\nvery well prepared. For instance, you have to make<br />\nsacrifices for the career. I'll give you an example. It was a<br />\nbad winter. He told me,<br />\n'Tomorrow your lesson will be at<br />\nfive o'clock in the morning!' I<br />\nsaid, 'Well, you have to make<br />\nsacrifices.' So when I got there at<br />\nfive past five, he was already<br />\ndressed and shaved. He said,'You<br />\nare five minutes late.' He then<br />\ntold me,'Tomorrow you have to<br />\nlearn this.' But tomorrow I have<br />\nschool,' I protested, 'I have all<br />\nthis work.' He told me, 'You<br />\nmust be prepared because in this<br />\ncareer you have an emergency.<br />\nThe next night you might have to<br />\ngo on and perform something<br />\nwithout knowing the score. And<br />\nyou have to do it.' It was this<br />\nkind of human and psychological<br />\npreparation that was so<br />\nimportant.<br />\nThen I was influenced very<br />\nmuch by another conductor,<br />\nKonstantin Silvestri. He was very<br />\nimaginative. He was so colorful in<br />\nhis interpretations, just opposite<br />\nof Lindeberg. From him I learned<br />\nto take a piece of music and find<br />\nsomething beyond the notes, to<br />\ncreate something that even is not<br />\n.technically part of the text. And<br />\nanother conductor was George<br />\nGeorgscu. In fact, ilf_! was mv<br />\ntalent.<br />\nso-called very first influence. He was an enormous<br />\nwas<br />\nhe<br />\nwhy<br />\nhim<br />\nask<br />\nYou<br />\nperson.<br />\nHe was a very intuitive<br />\nit<br />\nlike<br />\nDo<br />\nit.<br />\nlike<br />\n'You<br />\nanswered,<br />\nhe<br />\nand<br />\ndoing it like this,<br />\nby nature to<br />\nthis.' He could motivate himself to conduct<br />\n<br />\nmake the music spontaneous. And from him I tried to<br />\nlearn this.<br />\nAnd, of course, you learn from everyone, hearing. Even<br />\nat my age, you hear all the time new things and you learn<br />\nthem. As with any professional. As if somehow it is<br />\ntomorrow that he starts his profession. And to be a<br />\nprofessional conductor, you have to learn from yourself.<br />\nThe most important teacher is yourself.<br />\nUntil I was thirty years old, I could not find myself. I<br />\nwas conducting sometimes like one of them. I realized at<br />\n30 that I was conducting in the style of my thinking. I<br />\nwas just a copy, trying to do what another conductor had<br />\ntaught me. I said, at thirty, that now was the time to try<br />\nto put it all together and try to build yourself. To<br />\ndiscover where is Commissiona in this combination. It<br />\ntook time, and by now, I think I have a good idea of my<br />\nconducting. My interpretation doesn't sound lilce<br />\nsomeone else.I influence. I do music my way.<br />\nWhen I conduct, I don't look at myself in the mirror.<br />\nAnd I don't prepare my choreography. It is very<br />\nspontaneous. I am reading the music very intensely during<br />\nmy conducting.I think that I can project more than with<br />\njust two hands or two fingers--with my whole body, with<br />\nmy vision and my face. If this helps for better<br />\nmusic-making than it is important. If it is for strictly<br />\nphysical appearance to influence the ladies than I should<br />\nsay that this is a fake, that it is not sincere. But I, on my<br />\nconscience, and all the Beethovens, all the Mahlers, all the<br />\nMozarts who I hope I will meet sometime in another<br />\nworld, they would testify that when I am doing their<br />\nmusic badly, that I am doing it sincerely.<br />\nCan you remember any childhood experiences<br />\nwhich were imporant to your musical background?<br />\nI was in the fire-brigade during the war. A youngster<br />\nbetween 13 and 16, during the bombardments, was set<br />\nout to watch with some official person, and to try to help<br />\nhim get a fire out. And I did. We were very young, but<br />\nvery scared for our lives.<br />\nI was in the street at the National Theatre, and we had<br />\nbeen sent to try to do something. It was such a terrifying,<br />\napocalyptic scene. I remember the detail& very<br />\nBeautifully old-fashioned velvet, and this enormous hall<br />\nof marble. And I saw the fire as the end of my world, of<br />\nculture. And when I saw the piano, it was like I wanted to<br />\nsay good-bye to the music and good-bye to the culture.<br />\nAnd for a moment...it was a moment of...Host my fear. I<br />\nfelt that everyone is dying. People are dying. Music is<br />\ndying. I sat down and played the piano. Maybe it was<br />\nbeing young. An act of love for music. I remember this<br />\nvery well because it was such an apocalyptic scene. I<br />\ndidn't feel that the theatre was going, the street was<br />\ngoing. I felt that all the world finished in this moment.<br />\nAnyway, now I smile because it was an over-romantic<br />\n<br />\nmoment, hut we are all romantics in fact.<br />\nDo you have any favorite composers?<br />\nI say usually no, but in fact it is yes. I have a<br />\nparticular affection for Mahler. Of course, I'm changing,<br />\nbut for the last five years I have been very serious for<br />\nMahler. I adore all kinds of music. I don't like to diet in<br />\nmusic, to say I'm a specialist. I am doing things worse<br />\nthan others, but I am trying to be creative musically.<br />\nI think Ma!iler is very dear, since he has such an<br />\nenormous kaleidoscopic world in his music. He depicts<br />\nthe human emotions more, I think, than other composers.<br />\nThe misery and the happiness, the human side of life.<br />\nMahler is more than just an artist creating beautiful<br />\nthings, a symphony in four movements. It's a life story, a<br />\nbiography, a complete life span. He says in music a big<br />\nlove scene--romantic--but behind his mind there are so<br />\nmany othei things. The connection forrom his childhood.<br />\nHis birth, the marches, even the little vulgar things of the<br />\nstreet. It is an enormous world.<br />\nWere there any restrictions placed on your musical<br />\neducation in terms of what you learned and what you<br />\nwere able to conduct?<br />\nIn the training at the academy of music, we were<br />\navoided different kinds of music, styles, modern<br />\nrepertory. A certain part of Bartok was completely<br />\nunknown. Schoenberg and the twelve-tone music.<br />\nWebern. Of course, Cage and others were decadent<br />\nmusic. Even at certain times, Wagner was restricted<br />\nbecause Hitler liked Wagner. So in effect, we handled<br />\nmanuscripts of scores which came clandestinely. I<br />\nremember hearing Schoenberg and Bartok for the first<br />\ntime, very secretly. It was an enormous, fascinating<br />\ndiscovery. I don't know why; certainly the situation now<br />\nis better in Rumania. But my time was after the war. Also<br />\npart of the Baroque music was very little taught. When I<br />\ncame out of Rumania I knew very little of the Baroque<br />\nmusic. Certainly now it's changed. I know from my<br />\ncolleagues in Rumania that the education has changed.<br />\nThey are allowed, they are trained.<br />\nThere certainly were other reasons why I left Rumania.<br />\nPolitical freedom which I find very important. Freedom is<br />\nnot only to know Schoenberg or not, because in fact you<br />\ncan live without Schoenberg. But the life is not very good.<br />\nAs an artist, you are very well treated. You are getting<br />\nyour holidays and your vacations. Life is very nicely<br />\norganized. But as an individual, you are really destroyed.<br />\nYou are manipulated by other people, and they make<br />\nyour thinking, your judgment of what to conduct. Once a<br />\nyear I went to the Minister of Culture and got a list of<br />\nconcerts, where to conduct and what to conduct. If you<br />\nwant to live in your beautiful apartment and to avoid the<br />\nlife around you, okay. But I don't think that an artist is<br />\nhuman being who lives in his<br />\ntower. An artist, if he is a real<br />\nartist and wants to be in the<br />\nfront of his civilization, he<br />\ncannot get. for himself, getting<br />\nchampagne. It is a very artificial<br />\nlife. And it took a certain<br />\nnumber of years to learn to<br />\nbecome a free citizen.<br />\nro<br />\njudge for myself. To be<br />\ndemocratic.

John Irwin,<br />\nChairperson of the Department,<br />\nfelt this growth threatened to<br />\nhamper communication, and<br />\nhoped student representatives<br />\ncould generate some feedback<br />\nand enthusiasm.<br />\nThough only half of the<br />\nSeminars majors came to the<br />\nmeeting, those who came were<br />\nenthusiastic. Five representatives'<br />\nwere elected: freshmen Robin<br />\nJaslow and Emily Nye,<br />\nsophomore Harris Gruman,<br />\njunior Barbara Smith and senior<br />\nEdward Sullivan.<br />\nSeveral ideas presented at the<br />\nmeeting have already been put<br />\ninto effect. A small press section<br />\ncomposed of journals that<br />\npublish the work of young<br />\nwriters has been set up in the<br />\nHutzler Reading Room. This is<br />\ndesigned to enable student<br />\nwriters to become familiar with<br />\nthe type of writing likely to be<br />\naccepted by such publications.<br />\nThis is especially important since<br />\nthe MSE Library has cancelled<br />\nmany creative writing journals<br />\ndue to disuse and lack of funds.<br /><br />\nThe small press section has been<br />\nset up in Hutzler Reading Room,<br />\nand will be maintained by<br />\nWriting Seminars majors.<br />\nUndergraduate readings,<br />\nsimilar to current graduate<br />\nreadings, will be presented.

This year, however,<br />\nmany writing majors expressed<br />\nan interest in reading their poetry<br />\nand fiction.

This<br />\nproposition would bar any<br />\nperson from teaching in that<br />\nstate who openly practices or<br />\nadvocates a homosexual lifestyle.<br />\n\"No On 6\" started off slowly,<br />\npartially due to discouragement<br />\nin the gay community over the<br />\nlosses in Dade County, Florida,<br />\nEugene, Oregon, and St. Paul,<br />\nMinnesota.

Bill Newlin.<br /><br />\nSymposium Success I<br />\nThings have changed since the Sixties, as Ralph<br />\nAbernathy's Baptist-style sermon Tuesday in the M.S.E.<br />\nSymposium Series vividly served to remind us. That just 15<br />\nyears ago in this city black people were not allowed to sleep<br />\nin the \"best\" hotels or eat in the \"best\" restaurants is an<br />\nhistorical reality which almost defies comprehension. The<br />\nexperiences Abernathy recalled--beatings; the burning of his<br />\nhouse, 42 arrests--are also chilling. But Abernathy, whether<br />\nhe likes it or not, is now a successful man. As Symposium<br />\nChairperson Becker pointed out in his introduction, \"the<br />\ncareer of the Reverend Ralph Abernathy is the history of<br />\nthe black movement.\"<br />\nAlthough there are still far too many bigoted people<br />\naround in this country, the times have definitely changed.<br />\nIll the words of Reverend Abernathy, \"the SCLC has moved<br />\nfrom page 1 of our papers to page 21, or not at all.\"This<br />\nsays something about newspapers, but it says something<br />\neven more important about our society.<br />\nEugene McCarthy provided a different kind of<br />\nretrospective Wednesday. The United States in the 1960's<br />\nreally did behave as a militarist\u201eimperialist nation, as much<br />\nas any Western nation during this century, with the<br />\nexception of Nazi Germany. And today the military<br />\nbureaucracy is just as securely entrenched here as it is in<br />\ninto the<br />\ndie Soviet Union. The Vietnam War all too rapidly fades<br />\nremoteness of American history.<br />\nMcCarthy combined the insight available only to a key<br />\nparticipant in the events of the Sixties with remarkable<br />\nobjectivity. What resulted was an ideal intellectual<br />\npresentation, an excellent and enjoyable climax to the 1978<br />\nversion of the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium.<br /><br />\nGala Grid Weekend<br />\nWhile the Hopkins-Swarthmore football game this week<br />\nhardly holds out earthshaking possibilities,the college<br />\nfootball in Maryland this weekend reaches a peak which it<br />\nhas never experienced in the last 20 years.

In<br />\nthis device, an ionization<br />\ndetector utilizes a radioactive<br />\nsource, as an essential component<br />\nfor its operation.<br />\nAccording to Honeywell<br />\nofficials, the unit contains 4.4<br />\nmicrocuries of Americium-241, an<br />\nelement closely related to<br />\nplutonium and radium. Exposure<br />\nto the full force of this radiation<br />\nwould be fatal, according to<br />\nFederal guidelines concerning<br />\ntolerance levers for Americium<br />\nradiation. Such exposure could<br />\nresult from actually touching the<br />\nsubstance physically, or from<br />\nbeing in close proximity to it for<br />\na n extended period of time.<br />\nThe manufacturer says that<br />\nthe units are safe and the<br />\nUniversity agrees. In order to be<br />\nfair it should also be mentioned<br />\nthat the Nuclear Regulatory<br />\nCommission (NRC) has also<br />\nconcluded-- for now--that these<br />\nunits are benign. Although many<br />\nclaims that these detectors are<br />\nharmless prevail, the potential for<br />\ndisaster is still a concern. (With<br />\nall due respect, neither the<br />\nscientists at the NRC nor the<br />\nAdministrators here are even<br />\nclosely related to God)<br />\nPoliticks and Other Human<br />\nInterests in a January 31, 1978<br />\narticle states that : \"The NRC<br />\nbased its decision to license<br />\nionization smoke detectors upon<br />\ntests commissioned by the<br />\nmanufacturers\". This is an apparent<br />\nconflict of interests.<br />\nLet us grant that radiation<br />\nnormally emitted from our<br />\ndetectors is considered minimal<br />\nand below today's accepted<br />\nsafety levels. Will they be beloW<br />\ntomorrows? In the '50's nothing<br />\nwas thought of fluoroscoping<br /><br />\n(x-rays forming an image by<br />\nprojection onto a fluorescent<br />\nscreen) children's feet to see if<br />\ntheir shoes fit properly. Many of<br />\nthese children later developed<br />\nmalformed feet. In the early '60's<br />\nindividuals were treated for acne<br />\nwith radiation and now these<br />\npeople suffer abnormally high<br />\nrates of skin cancer. These<br />\npractices were within safety<br />\nlimits then, but have proven<br />\ncatastrophic. Are we to suppose<br /><br />\nwill affect your detector,<br />\nespecially if it bears some hidden<br />\ndefect. Admittedly this is a<br />\nremote possibility, but must you<br />\nbe made to take the risk.<br />\nAnother problem exists even if<br />\nyour unit is functioning perfectly<br />\nand is apparently harmless. When<br />\nthere is a fire your detector<br />\nshould sound off and warn you<br />\nto leave. Unfortunately, the<br />\ntechnical marvel that just raised<br />\nthe alarm will remain behind and<br /><br />\nthat in 1978 we have attained<br />\nultimate wisdom? Must we be<br />\nforced to tolerate excess<br />\nradiation regardless of the<br />\namount? Nobel Laureate Linus<br />\nPauling has been quoted by the<br />\nAugust 1977 issue of The<br />\nProgressive: \"The nature of high<br />\nenergy radiation and the nature<br />\nof the gene are such that genetic<br />\nmutations could occur even at<br />\nthe lowest dose rates...That is,<br />\nthere is no (safe) threshhold.\"<br />\nCan a manufacturer make<br />\nevery unit perfect? Is there such<br />\na thing as 100% quality control?<br />\nMany will sensibly acknowledge<br />\nthat this is impossible. Even if<br />\nthe previous argument as to<br />\nwhether a well-functioning unit is<br />\ncompletely harmless is ignored,<br />\nconsider this : what if the<br />\ndetector you get is the one that<br />\nwasn't made correctly and is<br />\nreleasing radioactivity?<br />\nRemember that there is enough<br />\nin one unit to seriously harm you<br />\neven if there's only partial<br />\nexposure. Checking every unit<br />\nfor contaminating defects<br />\ntomorrow will not protect<br />\nanyone. Ionization detectors<br />\nhave only been marketed a few<br />\nyears. No one can say how time<br /><br />\nbe burned to a crisp. Richard<br />\nBright, a fire research engineer at<br />\nthe National Bureau of Standards<br />\n(NBS) is cited in the Progressive<br />\narticle :\"Under extreme heat the<br />\namericium within may oxidize<br />\nand vaporize. The gold foils that<br />\ncontain the americium are quite<br />\nthin and will melt at only 1063<br />\ndegrees Centigrade; they are not<br />\nentirely indestructible.\" The<br />\nWashington Post on February 9,<br />\n1977, in an article entitled \"A<br />\nReply on Relative Smoke<br />\nDetectors\" reports that the<br />\nBritish government found that:<br />\n\"some home detectors released<br />\nmore radioactivity than they<br />\nshould at 600 degrees Centigrade<br />\n(a temperature typical of a home<br />\nfire).\" Moreover, this article<br />\nstates that: \"the U.S. government<br />\ndoes not require manufacturers<br />\nto test currently marketed<br />\ndetectors under conditions of<br />\nhome or industrial fires.\" The<br />\nrelease of excessive radiation<br />\nfrom destroyed ionization fire<br />\ndetectors would obviously be an<br />\nenormous problem.

The<br />\nmost popular music we run is<br />\ndisco. But we must be balanced.<br />\nWe want something for<br />\neverybody.\" So far the Rat has<br />\nhad bluegrass, country, rock,<br />\nrhythm and disco.<br />\nScheduling has also become<br />\nmore flexible. No longer are<br />\nThursdays autmatically devoted<br />\nto disco. Disco still reigns at least<br />\nonce a week, but on occasion it<br />\nhas been switched to Friday or<br />\nSaturday.<br />\nThe intention is to enliven the<br />\nRat's image. Potischman wants<br />\nstudents to consider the Rat as a<br />\nviable choice for weekend<br />\nentertainment, not just a last<br />\nresort. He says the Rat's current<br />\nproblem is twofold. First of all,<br />\n\"Hopkins students are not a ,<br />\nreliable market. They're not<br /><br />\ninterested in the Rat...We're<br />\ntaken for granted. The Rat is -a<br />\ngiven.\" Secondly, the Rat's<br />\nreputation for being a pickup<br />\njoint discourages some potential<br />\npatrons. \"Our emphasis is on<br />\nentertainment, not sex. But this<br />\nis a college bar and so it will<br />\ninevitably have the atmosphere<br />\nof a singles bar.\"<br />\nStudents from certain other<br />\narea colleges, such as Goucher<br />\nand Notre Dame, are admitted to<br />\nthe Rat. Potischman calculates<br />\nthat on disco nights,<br />\napproximately 50% of the<br />\nclientele consists of Hopkins<br />\nstudents. Regardless of its<br />\ncomposition, Rat attendance has<br />\nincreased markedly this year.<br />\nSaturday night the Rat will<br />\nstage Promo Disco. Free records,<br />\nradios and headphones will be<br />\nawarded by the House of Power.<br /><br />\nAfrica,\" Abernathy did not<br />\nsound bitter. \"I do not believe in<br />\nblack supremacy,\" he said. \"It<br />\nmust be a movement for poor,<br />\nblack and middle-class alike. We<br />\nmust move...to change the hearts<br />\nof men and women.\"<br />\nAdding that \"we are all tied<br />\ntogether in one bond of<br />\nmutuality,\" Abernathy called on<br />\nthe audience not to be apathetic.<br />\n\"If I were you,\" he said, \"I<br />\nwould get involved, and get me a<br />\nsong.\"<br />\nHe further warned that blacks<br />\nshould not be content with<br />\n\"tokenism.\" \"We move crossing<br />\nthe railroad track and we live in a<br />\nhouse with a- bath and a half and<br />\nwe are content,\" he said. Abernathy cited examples<br />\nright on the Hopkins campus of<br />\nongoing racial discrimination.<br />\nOnly three of this year's Medical<br />\nSchool freshmen are black, he<br />\nsaid. Later, when told that there<br />\nare only 1 0 7 black<br />\nundergraduates at Hopkins, he<br />\nshook his head and gave the<br />\naudience a look of shame. \"You<br />\nmust do better than that. You<br />\nmust do better than that,\" lie<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"Our ancestors may not have<br />\ncome over on the same boat,\"<br />\nAbernathy concluded, \"but<br />\ndarned if we aren't sinking today<br />\non the same boat.\" Then, the<br />\npeaceful Abernathy, who has had<br />\nhis church and home dynamited,<br />\nand who has received threats by<br />\nthe thousands, revealed what he<br />\nconsidered the key to ending<br />\nracial discrimination.<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nbracadabra,<br />\nI sit on his knee.<br />\nPresto chango,<br />\nand now he is me.<br />\nHocus pocus,<br />\nwe take her to bed.<br />\nMagic is fun;<br />\nwe're dead.<br /><br />\n'THE CONDUCTOR: THE NEWEST AND<br />\nSTRANGEST MUSICAL VIRTUOSO'<br />\nwith OR.

The main reason why he consented to this<br />\ninterview was that, as he suggested, the time has come for,<br />\nthe great figures of the past he knew to be remembered.<br />\nYet the retired U.S. Army Colonel is very important; to<br />\nme, and to those who know him. He is a wealth of<br />\nknowledge, a virtually inexhaustible reservoir of facts and<br />\nminutiae that make the memories of others pale in<br />\ncomparison. The Colonel has packed more excitement<br />\nand color, into his life than most anybody else you will<br />\never meet. It was not he who had the privilege of this<br />\ninterview; it was I.<br />\nAs the tale of one man's past slowly unfolded, I soon<br />\nrealized that it would be impossible to include everything<br />\nhe had to say in one feature article (or two, for that<br />\nmatter). This article is therefore bits and pieces of the<br />\ninterview which I think might interest the readers. Any<br />\nerrors made in transcribing dates, names, places or events<br />\nare my responsibility.<br />\nIN THE EARLY YEARS:<br />\nQ: You taught here. What did you teach?<br />\nA: I was appointed to what they then called the<br />\nTeacher's College...now it's called the Evening College. I<br />\nhad the rank of assistant professor, held it for three days,<br />\nand in 1940, after three days, I received my mobilization<br />\norders! I went into the Army,and didn't come back until<br />\n1960...Oh, I'm an alumnus, in fact a senior alumnus, and I<br />\ndid my undergraduate work here...but people like that<br />\ncome a tuppence a peck. Anyway, I came home after<br />\nsome 23 years of military service, all shot' to hell, and<br />\nwilly-nilly, they asked me to teach in the Evening College!<br />\nI've written some books, and a few volumes of verse since<br />\nthen.<br />\nQ: When were you an undergraduate?<br />\nA: Well,! graduated from Boys' Latin School in...1927.<br />\nThen, before I could wangle my old man to send me<br />\nthrough here, he said, \"I want you to go to law school.\"<br />\nHe was a lawyer, and since he had the money bags. I said,<br />\n\"Yes, Father, I'll go to law school.\" So I spent 1927 to<br />\n1930 getting a law degree in the School of Law at the<br />\nUniversity of Baltimore. That was the second class that<br />\ngraduated there. I'm intending to write a set of<br />\nverses...about the faculty there that taught me. In the<br />\nLaw School then were some of the most brilliant jurists<br />\nand members of the bar...men like Judge Walter Preston<br />\nand Philip Heiusler. I think the faculty they had then was<br />\nfar superior to what they have now.<br />\nQ: Why do you say that?<br />\nA: Well in the first place, it was very small. The faculty<br />\nworked for next to nothing, since they did it mostly to<br />\nhelp the chaps through night school. Now it's huge...I<br />\nthink they made it too big, too fast...and the faculty can't<br />\nmatch up to the great galaxy of men we had...Eugene<br />\nEtIgett...probably the greatest living authority then on the<br />\nlaw of real property...John S.T. Yost...Judge Albert<br />\nSidney Johnston Owens...<br />\nWell anyway, I go through in 1930, and told my father,<br />\n\"Well, here's my degree, but I don't want to practice, and<br />\nI still want to go to Hopkins!\" So my father said okay, go<br />\non out and enroll. He gave me thirty dollars a month and<br />\nsaid if I could make ends meet on thirty dollars a month,<br />\nthen I could go on and get my degrees...<br />\nQ: That was your allowance? Thirty dollars a month?<br />\nDid you make ends meet?<br />\nA: Yes indeed. Q: Did you work while you went to<br />\nHopkins?<br />\nA: I did some tutoring, and I kept tightening belts, but<br />\nit wasn't too bad...you see, things were cheap then.<br />\nQ: Could you get a good beer for a dime?<br />\nA: Well, not then. A good beer was fifteen cents, but<br />\nwe didn't have any beer till Saturday nights anyway. Once<br />\neach week, I and a friend from the History Department,<br />\nand another one from the Romance Languages<br />\nDepartment, and maybe one or two friends from Political<br />\nScience would all meet at a place called the Log<br />\nCabin...what is now called the Blue Jay. We would stop<br />\nwork in the evening about six on Saturday. We'd saved up<br />\naIl week, and would have two or three beers. That was<br />\nmore fun, much more fun, than it is today...<br />\nON LIFE AT HOPKINS\u2022<br />\nA: The Glass Pavilion, and both wings of Levering,<br />\n,lidn't exist then. We still had the cafeteria...the food was<br />\nI orrible.<br />\nQ: Horrible. eh? Some things never change, then?<br />\nA: I think the food here is pretty good.<br />\nA: Oh.<br /><br />\nAn Interview With Colonel Frederid<br />\nQ: Well...compared to what it was like back then.<br />\nQ: What was a typical meal like?<br />\nA: Whichever was the cheapest! You could get a large<br />\nbowl of stew and some bread, make a pretty decent meal<br />\nfor about forty cents.<br />\nA: When I worked at Hopkins, we had some of the<br />\ngreatest scholars this University has ever possessed. Men<br />\nlike Tenney Frank, David Moore Robinson, Kent Roberts<br />\nGreenfield, Frederic Chopin Lane...oh, and Jacob<br />\nHollander!...his portrait is up there in his great red robes<br />\nin the Main Entrance Room of Gilman Hall...one went to<br />\nhim for Political Economy.<br />\nDr. Frederic Lane was the great scholar that ran the<br />\nentire undergraduate history department...History 'A' and<br />\n`B'... Q: What was History A and B?<br />\nA: History A began at the close of the Roman Empire,<br />\nand came up to the Middle Ages. History B picked it up at<br />\nthe Middle Ages and brought it up to World War One.<br />\nThen there were those awful things called `surveys'...<br />\nQ: Surveys?<br />\nA: No way you could avoid em!...in the sense that the<br />\nfields were so broad, you just couldn't. We had to go so<br />\nfast, cover century after century. Well, Dr. Lane...truly a<br />\nremarkable man, I don't know how many books he's<br />\npublished...gosh, lie must be in his middle eighties by<br />\nnow. Well, one of his great books was on his specialty,<br />\nwhich was Venice in the period of the great shipping era.<br />\nWell, the book, which was widely acclaimed among the<br />\nscholarly world, had the unfortunate title of Venetian<br />\nShips and Shipping. You can very well imagine what the<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate students called the<br />\nbook!...that was a stock joke among the undergraduates<br />\nfor many years...<br />\nThe little tiny bits and things like that I had all jotted<br />\ndown in my notebooks, of course...<br />\nTHE TIMES OF DISCONTENT:<br />\nA: Do you remember when they had that hideous<br />\nphenomena called the 'Bonus March?' All those so-called<br />\nveterans of World War One were trying to force the<br />\nCongress to pass a free handout, a great big bonus, just<br />\nbecause they had served in the Army. Congress was very<br />\nmuch divided, but they inevitably yielded, as politicians<br />\nalways do, because they had to think about the votes, and<br />\nso they passed the damn thing. Herbert Hoover vetoed it,<br />\nand oh my God, there was the damndest .explosion! I<br />\nforget the man's name who led this march of six or 'seven<br />\nthousand of these men...and they all just walked into<br />\nWashington and set up a perfectly ghastly encampment<br />\ndown on the Anacostia flats. They just squatted<br />\nthere...there were no sanitary provisions and the place<br />\nbegan to stink. They were panhandling all over the city,<br />\nbegging money for food, and used to make little<br />\ncampfires to cook soup. It was perfectly shocking. Well,<br />\nfinally, Mr. Hoover told the leader that he would not<br />\ntolerate the discriminatory legislation; that there was no<br />\nmore reason that the Veterans should have a great big<br />\nhuge free handout than somebody who had taken ill in<br />\ngovernment service, and that half of the men had not even<br />\nseen a shot fired...<br />\nWell, that got them good and mad, and they began to<br />\nriot, which polished things off. General Douglas<br />\nMacArthur, Chief of Staff of the Army, who was the<br />\nbiggest egomaniac on Earth, was called in with the Ft.<br />\nMyer Garrison and told to burn the place down. I was in<br />\nWashington at the time, and I saw it...<br />\nMacArthur's troops went down there to carry out the<br />\nPresident's orders, but first they offered to help these<br />\nmen and sent down a rolling kitchen to feed them...and<br />\n'then told them to go home. But they refused to<br />\nbudge...just squatted. So MacArthur rode in on a white<br />\nhorse...my God, I couldn't see how he could raise his left<br />\nhand; he had medals hanging down to his belly<br />\nbutton...with his whole battalion of the Third (Regular)<br />\nU.S. Infantry behind him with fixed bayonets. The<br />\ncommander of the battalion said to the squatters, \"Men,<br />\nyou must leave on the President's orders! I'm ordered to<br />\ndestroy this rat's nest of disease and potential cause of<br />\nepidemic. The water you're drinking isn't fit to drink and<br />\nyou're contaminating everything.\" Well, they all hissed<br />\nand booed and yelled. The commander gave an order to<br />\nthe troops to fan out and present bayonets and advance.<br />\nWell, some of the buggers stood, but the rest of them<br />\nstarted to run like hell...<br /><br />\nby Adam L.<br />\nON GRADUATE LIFE:<br /><br />\nth<br />\n\"I(<br /><br />\nQ: What did you do your dissertation on?<br />\nA: A history of Aeronautic Operations in the American<br />\nCivil War.<br />\nQ: You mean dirigibles?<br />\nA: No, they were captive observation balloons. It was a<br />\nvery highly-organized thing that was disbanded in<br />\n1863...You know, it's interesting; the dissertation won<br />\nthe Mrs. Simon Baruch University Award--a thousand cold<br />\nbucks--for the best doctoral dissertation on the Civil War<br />\nor Southern History. Now, Mrs. Simon Baruch was the<br />\nmother of the great Bernard Baruch, (President<br />\nRoosevelt's personal advisor), and also is the grandmother<br />\nof Mrs. Barbara Tuchrnan, who wrote the Guns of<br />\nAugust...<br />\nQ: Do you think students and teachers are<br />\nbecoming too specialized?<br /><br />\nA: Well,<br />\ndon't know enough about how the<br />\ncurriculum operates now, but my own idea of the ideal is<br />\na solid, broad background. I don't see how it's possible to<br />\nqualify for graduate status in a department without being<br />\nwell-versed in general background...<br />\nOne of the most beautiful associations I ever had<br />\nwas conferring on my dissertation with Dr. Ella Lonn. She<br />\nwas the head of the History Department at Goucher<br />\nCollege.<br />\nQ: When was this?<br />\nA: I'd say about 1936 to 1940. She had been the great<br />\nspecialist in the Civil War...she's written about seven<br />\nbooks; she's dead now. When I received my mobilization<br />\norders, she had already reviewed chapter after chapter of<br />\nmy dissertation...she made suggestions, improvements,<br />\nwhat not...I went down to see her one day, and I told her<br />\nthat I was leaving. The first volume of my work had just<br />\nbeen published and the second was in progress. I told her<br /><br />\nsai<br />\nfo<br />\nan<br />\nso<br />\nco<br />\nan<br />\nan<br />\nact<br />\nco<br />\nba<br />\nlat<br />\nto<br />\nph<br />\nPr<br /><br />\npic<br />\npic<br />\nan:<br />\nho<br />\nan<br />\nint<br />\nCo<br />\ncol<br />\nha<br />\nno<br /><br />\nyo<br /><br />\nJ\"i'l THE WAY 'Willy', WERE<br /><br />\nrick Stansbury Haydon 0.B.E., M.C.<br />\nL. Gruen<br />\nthat I might not come back...it was a damn big war we<br />\n,vere in.<br />\nI turned over every scrap of material I could find and<br />\nsaid to her, \"Here, you take it. Finish the second volume<br />\nfor me by all means.\" Well, the old lady burst into tears<br />\nand said, \"Oh, you'll come back!\" and I certainly hoped<br />\nso! But she ended up by promising me that if I didn't<br />\ncome back, that she would do it. I took everything I had<br />\nand stored it in a special room in the Library of Congress,<br />\nand wrote out a legal paper giving her the right to have<br />\naccess the moment the casualty lists showed that I wasn't<br />\ncoming home...Obviously it happened that I did come<br />\nback, and we had quite a celebration! Then a few years<br />\nlater the poor old lady died.<br />\nShe was a perfectly wonderful character.. I've been out<br />\nto Goucher several times and asked for portrait<br />\nphotographs of Dr. Gallagher, who had been her<br />\nPredecessor, and Dr. Lonn. They gave me a beautiful<br /><br />\nthey loci no<br />\npicture of Kate Gallagher, but they said<br />\nnever allow<br />\nwould<br />\nshe<br />\npictures of Dr. Lonn!

I reported to Headquarters in London, and they<br />\nshipped me right on up to Glasgow. We all went aboard<br />\ntroop ships...the men on board were mostly British. You<br />\nsee, the British really ran that thing; they had a big field<br />\narmy, the First British Army. The Americans had only<br />\none division, the First U.S. Infantry Division, and some<br />\ncorps artillery. I was attached to the British Forces, to<br />\nserve as American Liaison Officer in the HQ of the Fifth<br />\nBritish Corps, and later with the British 47th<br />\n(\"Battle-Axe\")Infantry Division.<br />\nWell, hardly had we landed when Rommel was caught<br />\nin a nutcracker, between Montgomery's troops to the<br />\nSouth, and us to the North. Rommel stopped them at the<br />\nMareth line, though...They couldn't go around it, and<br />\nthey couldn't break through it.<br />\nThe Germans brought in this old bugger named Jurgen<br />\nvon Arnim, a very aristocratic man that came from the<br />\nPrussian military families who claimed descent from the<br />\nTeutonic Knights. He took over the Northern armies<br />\nwhile Rommel was fighting off the English, but they<br />\nstopped us, being heavily reinforced. The terrain and<br />\nnumbers being what they were, we only had this one little<br />\ndamn mountain road for supply, because we didn't have<br />\nenough airplanes to supply by air. As a result, half the<br />\ntime we were half-starved! Well, finally, we got in the<br />\nThird and Thirty-Fourth U.S. Infantry Divisions, and that<br />\ngave us a Corps, and a lot more artillery. We finally broke<br />\nthrough and Montgomery did also.<br />\nRommel got the hell north as fast as he could to<br />\ncombine forces with von Arnim, and we boxed them into<br />\nthe Tunisian Cape. Rommel deserted his troops, probably<br />\nunder Hitler's orders, hopped a plane and got back to<br />\nGermany. Meanwhile, von Arnim, nasty as he was, stood<br />\nand fought as best he could.<br />\nA: Von Arnim, of course, decided that he just had<br />\nto surrender, and there was this great joke about him...He<br />\nhad broadcast back to Germany and to the world that the<br />\nGerman Army would fight to the last cartridge...and when<br />\nthey did surrender, he pretended that they had run out of<br />\nammunition. When he went to surrender, he had dressed<br />\nhimself up in this perfectly incredible uniform; he had<br />\nenough medals on him to sink a boat! He made the<br />\nmistake of wearing a gold belt with a Nazi dagger on it,<br />\nhowever...all high German officers wore them.<br />\nAs luck would have it, von Arnim was captured by<br />\ntroops of Australian/New Zealand Army Corps, the<br />\nANZAC. They were commanded by a really rugged old<br />\nman by the name of Kippenberger, an Australian. He<br />\nhated the Nazis, of course, but Kippenberger was just as<br />\nsimple as a cobbler's shoe, and von Arnim came into his<br />\ntent with full army dress.I think von Arnim expected<br />\nKippenberger to stand up and salute him! It shows you<br />\nthe arrogance of the man...Well, Kippenberger took one<br />\nlook at him, turned to the sentries, and growled,\"Haven't<br />\nI decided I'm not going to have any of these Nazis enter<br />\nmy tent armed? Take that person out and strip that damn<br />\ndagger off him!\" So the sent prodded von Arnim with<br />\nthe butt of his rifle, and von Arnim had the whole damn<br />\narrogance just kicked out of him...it was like watching a<br />\nballoon deflate. The sentry came in with the dagger and<br />\nsaid, \"Here it is, sir.\" Kippenberger said,\"Throw it in the<br />\nwaste basket.\"<br />\n...When Kippenberger was done questioning him, he<br />\ndidn't even say goodbye. He just said, \"Take this prisoner<br />\nback to the cage and throw him in there with the rest of<br />\nthem.\"...<br />\nA: The General that commanded the Afrika Korps,<br />\non the other hand, was a much gentler man by the name<br />\nof von Thoma\". He was, I believe, a Bavarian, much more<br />\ncivilized than the Prussians. When they captured the<br />\nGerman force, the Italians had all run away...two divisions<br />\nof them...so the Afrika Korps was captured. Von Thoma<br />\nput on his dress uniform, waited by his tank, and waving<br />\nthe first British tank that went by, called it over, and<br />\noffered his sword! Well, the tank commander was just a<br />\nsecond lieutenant, and he'd realized that he had just<br />\nbagged a full general, the..commander of the entire Afrika<br />\nKorps...<br />\nMontgomery wouldn't let von Thoma be put in prison<br />\nat all. He invited von Thoma to dinner, his orderly was<br />\nordered to give him a bath, they drank whiskey &amp; sodas,<br />\nhad wine with the dinner, and had a jolly good time!...<br /><br />\nQ: Did you see General Montgomery?<br />\nA: Yes, he was quite an amazing person--of course, he<br />\nhad that frightful row with George Patton.<br />\nQ: Did you see George Patton too?<br />\nA: Oh, God yes, I served under him. He was a<br />\nwonderful person,General Patton.<br />\nQ: Most people think of him as a tough soldier who<br />\ndidn't like to take orders.<br />\nA: They didn't know him. Oh, he put on all that<br />\ngrandstand play-acting. The troops thought the world of<br />\nhim. Did you ever hear of the time he challenged<br />\nRommel? Patton got into an ordinary Sherman tank, got<br />\nhis driver to take him out to the front lines and carried<br />\nalong with him a.bilingual interpreter who spoke German<br />\nand English. He knew the radio band that the Germans<br />\nwere using, so he sent a signal out on their frequency.<br />\nwhich they all heard, challenging Rommel to come out on<br />\nthe desert in any Mark tank of his choosing and 'shoot it<br />\nout!' Patton added that if he didn't, the Germans were a<br />\nbunch of goddamned cowardly bastards! Of course he<br />\nknew that Rommel wouldn't come out and fight...but<br />\nPatton gave a lift to the morale of every Allied soldier on<br />\nthe line. Two weeks later we drove them into the western<br />\nMediterranean...<br />\nQ: Could you shed some light on the lace-slapping'<br />\nincident concerning General Patton?<br />\nA: What happened was, the campaign in Sicily was<br />\nover, and Patton went around to all the field hospitals and<br />\nvisited the wounded...ordered that they be given more<br />\ncigarettes, and did everything he could to help them...the<br />\nman was soft under that shell of swashbuckling,<br />\npearl-handled pistols, and loud-mouthed blasphemies...<br />\nPatton had the burden of this campaign on his neck,<br />\nand he went to tent after tent of wounded. He went out<br />\ninto the waiting room of one of the wards of one of these<br />\nbig long hospitals, and here's this soldier sitting there<br />\nweeping and crying and carrying on, and Patton thought<br />\nhe had been wounded. So Patton sat down on his cot, and<br />\nput his arm around him, and said, \"I know, son, I know,<br />\nit hurts--we've all been hit, just buck up, and I'll get You<br />\nsome whiskey.\" Well, it turns out this soldier had never<br />\nbeen anywhere near the front...that he had run away, and<br />\nwas scared. The Provost said that if the psychiatrist didn't<br />\nfind anything wrong with him, he was going to be sent t<br />\nthe stockade. Well, then the soldier screamed and yelled<br />\nsome more, and went into a kind of hysteria. Patton<br />\nbeing a wise old chap, knew what to do...What would you<br />\ndo if you had somebody hysterical? Slap him in the face<br />\nWell, that's what he was doing, trying to stop this boy'<br />\nhysteria. So some...little first lieutenant of the Medical<br />\nCorps accused Patton of all kinds of brutality, and the<br />\nworst part was he wasn't a real doctor anyway, he was<br />\none of those quack psychiatrists. The newspaper people<br />\nwere called and there was this big row--just disgusting. All<br />\nPatton was doing was what any knowledgeable, sensible<br />\nwise officer would have done. If people had kept their<br />\nsnoots out of it he'd of slapped the soldier into the<br />\nrealization that it doesn't make any sense to get<br />\nhysterical. In fact, Patton told him,\"I'm on your side, 1'1<br />\nback you up, just stop crying!\" But of course the<br />\nnewspapers never published that. They said he'd slapped<br />\nsoldier in a hospital. Hospital? Hell, he'd never been in the<br />\nward, he didn't have a scratch on him. Well, that<br />\npractically ruined George Patton...<br />\n, If you've ever seen a bloody mess, you should have<br />\nseen Rome. There were Germans shooting at Italians,<br />\nItalians shooting at Germans, Italians shooting at<br />\nAmerican and British, Germans shooting at us, we were<br />\nshooting at them...no one knew what the hell was going<br />\non...<br />\n...Well, many more things were discussed than could<br />\nhave possibly been put in one article. The few gems<br />\nincluded here seem to me the briefest of highlights of the<br />\nentire interview, but, alas, they will have to serve. Colonel<br />\nHaydon spent 2\u00bd years in Korea, and his anecdotes about<br />\nthe war, Douglas MacArthur, General Westmoreland, the<br />\n2004th Quartermaster's Provisional Ice Cream Unit, and<br />\nmore, are omitted.<br />\nLooking back over the interview, I find that there was<br />\nreally no focal point to our conversation. It was, however,<br />\nsome of the most enjoyable two hours I've ever had<br />\ntalking with anyone. The Colonel can be found sitting<br />\ncomfortably in his little section of the library lounge, or<br />\nperhaps downing a well-deserved beer in Levering, or<br />\nsimply walking about the campus, admiring the landscape.<br />\nWherever you might find him, say hello, and be prepared<br />\nto engage in a conversation about almost anything that<br />\ninterests you.

BERCHIELLI<br />\nFor those who toil in the dusty corners of Latrobe<br />\nHall's basement, it has become a familiar sight--but for the<br />\nuninitiated, it might just as well be a mummy or some<br />\ngiant ipifiata, if it wasn't for the telltale graffito hastily<br />\nscribbled on the top, \"Bakker's Bones.\" \"Alas,\" one asks,<br />\n\"what is it!\"<br />\nIt is, explains Dr. Robert Bakker of the Earth and<br />\nPlanetary Sciences Department, the \"right upper leg bone,<br />\nfemur, from an extremely large dinosaur, one of the<br />\nlargest found in the country.\" Weighing around 1500<br />\n2 feet, the bone was<br />\n/<br />\npounds and measuring about 61<br />\nHopkins undergraduate<br />\nformer<br />\na<br />\nactually discovered by<br />\na western expedition<br />\non<br />\nJuly<br />\nearly<br />\nin<br />\nWayne<br />\nnamed Bob<br />\norganized by Dr. Bakker for the purpose of collecting<br />\ndinosaur and other vertebrate fossils for teaching and<br />\nresearch purposes.<br />\nThe group, consisting mostly of graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students, started on June 1st to tour<br />\nthrough New Mexico and Utah carefully collecting many<br />\nmammal and other fossils before arriving at that small<br />\nbadlands hill about an hour northeast of Laramie,<br />\nWyoming, where the mother skeleton was found. The site<br />\nwhere the first weathered fragments were spotted<br />\neventually grew with the help of nine excavators into a<br />\nhuge 20 by 10-foot pit 10 feet deep which yielded many<br />\nof the dinosaur's bones.<br />\nThe bones' original owner was a camarisaurus, an<br />\nanimal estimated by Dr. Bakker to have weighed about 48<br />\ntons and which spanned 60 feet (as opposed to \"only\" 45<br />\nfeet for the huge brontosaurus). \"It looked like a<br />\nbrontosaurus except bigger, ,with ai shorter neck, and<br />\nbigger head--more robust. It was a pretty impressive<br />\nanimal,\" conceded the long-haired, bearded paleontologist<br />\nin an ironic tone. Was the animal a vegetarian, like the<br />\nbrontosaurus? \"Yes, by physiology, not by religion,\"<br />\nquipped Dr. Bakker. By radiometric dating of the<br />\nsurrounding rock, one can tell that it lived about 140<br />\nmillion years ago,\"plus or minus five.\"<br />\nRemoving and transporting the Latrobe bone was<br />\nanother affair. Most fossils, exposed to dissolved minerals<br />\nd<br />\nfor millions of years, become partly or mostly petrifie<br />\nnatural<br />\nthe<br />\nreplaces<br />\n(rock-like) as rock material slowly<br />\nbone m a tteri However, this bone was \"heavy, but<br />\nextremely brittle--if you tap it, it would shatter into a<br />\ngilfion pieces.\"(How much is a gillion? \"A gillion is ten to<br />\nthe gilth,\" retorts the ever-jocular Dr. Bakker). To protect<br />\nthe bone for transport, it had to be literally mummified:<br />\nOn site it was soaked in a special preservative, \"then<br />\nwrapped in newspaper waked in water. then burlap<br />\nsoaked with plaster.\" Two by four planks were then<br />\nstrips<br />\nplaced on the plaster and fastened by plaster-soaked<br />\nto form a protective frame.<br /><br />\nActual removal of the bone was perhaps the most<br />\n\"interesting\" problem of all. Dr. Bakker and students had<br />\nto dig a loading platform into the side of a hill. Then,<br />\nwith ten people pushing, the huge mummified artifact was<br />\nslowly nudged into the rear of an E &amp; PS Department<br />\ncarry-all vehicle affectionately known as \"the great white<br />\nshark.\" Even though the nearest dirt road was eight miles<br />\naway, a graduate student managed to drive the bone back<br />\nover the two-thousand miles to its present obscure resting<br />\nplace.<br />\nEventually scheduled to be put on display at the<br /><br />\nMaryland Academy of Sciences Museum at the Inner<br />\nHarbor, it,along with other specimens, will provide a sort<br />\nof living display as visitors will be able to watch the<br />\nprogress of the bones as they are slowly reconstructed and<br />\nprepared at Hopkins. Comments Bakker, \"The object of<br />\nthe display is to show how bones are found, taken back to<br />\nthe lab, collected, preserved, prepared and, so on.\"<br />\nEventually, Dr. Bakker dreams of reconstructing the<br />\nwhole ,camarisaurus from latex moldings when the rest of<br />\nthe treated bones are excavated from the Wyoming site in<br />\ncont. on p. 16<br /><br />\nHalloween Seance<br />\nPacks In The Ectoplasm<br />\nagreed.

He introduced himself: 'Hi.<br />\nMy name is Pete: and I'll be coming on a little later.' The<br />\ncrowd, still milling among themselves, turned and<br />\nhesitated to clap as if they weren't really sure who this<br />\nperson was. He was the star of the show. Peter Gabriel<br />\nwent on to introduce the opening act, Jules and the Polar<br />\nBears, then retired backstage to wait his turn. But it was<br />\nthis frontality, this straight-forwardness with the<br />\naudience, which set the tone for his performance, which<br />\nmade the concert so great.<br />\nFor years, Gabriel was lead-singer with Genesis, and<br />\nthrough complex costumes and characters, he dramatized<br />\ntheir comPositions in concert. He left the band almost<br />\nthree years ago, and has released two solo albums in the<br />\nmeantime, but the concert last Thursday at the Lyric was<br />\npart of his first solo tour. Whereas with Genesis he always<br />\nhid behind masks, on this tour, Gabriel steps out and<br />\npresents himself in full view to his audience. The<br />\nhesitation on the part of the crowd was merely a<br />\nquestioning: 'Is that really him?'<br />\nWhen Gabriel emerged for his set, the crowd was ready,<br />\nand responded with a standing ovation. After singing a<br />\nditb to his teddy bear (his spiritual leader for twelve<br />\nyears), the concert proper began.<br />\nHe put on an orange crossing guard's vest, orange gloves<br />\nand a 'power pack' over his white pants and T-shirt. He<br />\nheld a small spot light in his hands and told the audience<br />\nhe was 'in search of the artist.' As taped music played,be<br />\nshined his spot over the audience. Spots appeared from<br />\nthe rear of the hall, and ,five people dressed identical to<br />\nGabriel began walking down the aisles of the orchestra.<br />\nThe music was blaring, the black lights on the stage<br />\nstrobed and six bright spots revolved around the hall. The<br />\nintensity of this bizarre experience heightened, then<br />\nclimaxed as Gabriel and the band broke into the first<br />\nhard-driving chords of'On The Air.'<br />\nFrom that point on, Gabriel, obviously having found<br />\nthe artist (himself), superbly performed almost all the<br />\ncompositions from his solo albums (both ironically titled<br />\nPeter Gabriel). Although some of the slower songs lagged<br />\ntowards the middle of the concert, the muscianship of<br />\nGabriel and his band (the electronics man was Larry Fast,<br />\nmastermind of Synergy) helped carry the audience<br />\nto the brilliant performances of `Solsbury Hill'<br />\nthy<br />\nlern Love' at the end. As the roadies took the,<br />\nand<br /><br />\nIt was the spring of 1974. The Dictators, a faceless hard<br />\nrock outfit made up of Jewish boys from the Bronx, was<br />\nplaying its usual set of songs to a handful of unreceptive<br />\nderelicts at PopeSfe's Spinach Factory, a dingy bar in<br />\nBrooklyn. Willing to try anything to spark some<br />\nenthusiasm, keyboardist and group leader Adny Shernoff<br />\ninvited roadie Richard Blum to sing lead vocals on \"Wild<br />\nThing.\" Blum, an overweight slob who had never set foot<br />\non a stage before, gladly accepted the offer.<br />\nA strange thing happened. As Blum bellowed and<br />\njumped about on stage, the drunks suddenly came to life.<br />\nHappy to see a fellow derelict in the spotlight, they began<br />\nto hoot and holler. Bottles and barstools flew. The drunks<br />\ndanced joyously as Blum gave one of the most stirring<br />\nrenditions of the Troggs' classic ever heard.<br />\nHandsome Dick Manitoba had been born.<br />\nEven with their charismatic frontman, however, the<br />\nroad to success has not been an easy one for the<br />\nDictators. Their debut album, The Dictators Go Girl<br />\nCrazy, released in 1975, failed commercially and they<br />\nwere subsequently dropped by Epic. Disillusioned, the<br />\nband members went their separate ways.<br />\nCritics raved over the record, though. With lines like \"I<br />\nthink Lou Reed is a creep\" and \"My favorite part of<br />\ngrowing up/is when I'm sick and throwing up,\" Go Girl<br />\nCrazy still remains the definitive comedy rock album.<br />\nAdny Shernofis tongue-in-cheek tributes to cars, girls,<br />\nTV, and teenage idiocy captured the hearts of many who<br />\nwere lucky enough to hear the LP, and eventually, the<br />\nband was reunited by popular demand.<br />\nA second album, Manifest Destiny, was released last<br />\nyear, and though it contained some stellar performances<br />\n(notably on \"Science Gone Too Far\" and \"Young, Fast<br />\nand Scientific\"), the overblown, Ezrinesque production<br />\nseemed inappropriate; after all, the 'Tators are a garage<br />\nband. It was apparent that the Dictators were suffering<br />\nfrom an identity crisis.<br />\nWhile in England earlier this year, Shernoff was<br />\ndevastated by the energy and uncompromising attitudes<br />\nof young bands like the Clash and Sham 69. This, he<br />\ndecided, was the direction the new Dictators were going<br />\nto take. Bassist Mark \"the Animal'.' Mendoze voiced his<br />\ndisapproval with Adny's decision and was quickly sent<br />\npacking. Along with him went his platform shoes and his<br />\nstrictly \"old wave\" ideas. Shernoff switched over to bass,<br />\nand the,stripped-down, fired-up Tators soon returned to<br />\nCont. on p. 16<br /><br />\nPt<br /><br />\nGabriel The Dictator<br /><br />\nstage, the concert was apparently over without Gabriel<br />\nsinging anything from his days with Genesis. Suddenly, he<br />\nshot from backstage, exchanging his vest for a leather<br />\njacket, and sang an incredibly powerful version of 'The<br />\nLamb Lies Down On Broadway' from his last album with<br />\nGenesis.<br />\nAlthough this certainly excited the Genesis fans in the<br />\naudience, perhaps the highlight of the show came earlier<br />\nwhen Gabriel, not content simply with direct<br />\ncommunication with his audience, left the stage and<br />\njoined the crowd. 'Waiting for the Big One' began<br />\ninstrumentally, and when the singing came in, Gabriel was<br />\nnot on stage. A spot caught him among the crowd, singing<br />\nin the balcony. The entire audience stood up to watch as<br />\nhe moved among the outstretched arms, going completely<br />\nacross the balcony. He then came downstairs and walked<br />\nup an aisle. People crowded to get a closer glimpse, to<br />\ntouch him or to shake his hand.<br />\nI have seen Patti Smith dancing on tables, but never<br />\nbefore have I seen a rock performer interact so directly<br />\nwith his audience. Gabriel would not settle with<br />\ndiscarding his masks and characters, presenting his music<br />\nopenly. He had to physically touch his audience and let<br />\nthein touch him.<br />\nAlso, thumbs up for the Polar Bears. Granted, Jules<br />\ncan't sing and can't play guitar, and they sound a bit like<br />\nBachman Turner Overdrive, but Jules and the Polar Bears<br />\ntake themselves so seriously and imitate so poorly the<br />\nconventions of New Wave performers that it is impossible<br />\nfor one not to laugh at them and not to feel affection for<br />\nthem. These Polar Bears may be a bit grizzily, but they<br />\nare still lovable. In the end, I can only echo Big Jim: 'It<br />\ndefinitely was a concert for cool cats.' Or cool bears as<br />\nthe case may be.<br /><br />\nF pter1 a i imemt<br /><br />\n-,tilps A Horseman<br /><br />\nSergiu Comissiork<br />\nThe Mon Wh-<br /><br />\ned<br /><br />\nThe Goof; Guys And The Bad Guys<br />\nWrangle In Unconventional Western<br />\nBY ROS RESNIc.:K<br />\n(WIWI is a conventional<br />\nIn many ways, Comes a<br />\n\u2022 heroism: Ella (Jane<br />\nwestern.

As an individual,<br />\nComissiona has achieved world-wide recognition as one of<br />\nthe great conductors of our times. In this interview, he<br />\ntalks about his life as a student in Bucharest and about<br />\nthe professional life he has maintained here in Baltimore.<br />\nThis opening segment of a two-part interview, deals with<br />\nhis musical background and the various events of his<br />\nyounger life which shaped him into the conductor--and<br />\nthe man--he is today.<br />\nWhat is your musical background and education?<br />\nI was born in Rumania, and you can guess this from my<br />\naccent. I started my musical studies in Rumania. I<br />\nenjoyed music as a kid as everyone enjoys waving their<br />\narms in front of the radio set. My dream was to become a<br />\nconductor from, the very, very beginning, so I didn't have<br />\ndreams to become a doctor or a fire brigade man or an<br />\nengineer of the locomotives. I wanted to be a conductor.<br />\nIt was clear from very early childhood. And I studied in<br />\nBucharest. The music conservatory. Violin first. I<br />\nperformed as'a violinist in small groups, playing chamber<br />\nmusic. I learned other theoretical disciplines too, but I<br />\nwas determined to become a conductor.<br />\nI started my professional life as a violinist playing with<br />\nan orchestra. At the same time, starting very seriously,<br />\nand hoping for a chance to break, to become a conductor.<br />\nThe chance was a melodramatic, romantic story. The<br />\nconductor didn't come to the performance; he was sick. It<br />\nwas an emergency. I stepped in and they liked my way. It<br />\nwas like the Sorceror's Apprentice. If you have a good<br />\nconcert, you will get two. If two good, that's four. It's a<br />\ngeometrical...progression. So to a certain extent, you<br />\nwant to stop it. But I started my career in Bucharest. Of<br />\ncourse, I also continued playing violin. I was conducting.<br />\nSo it was the break of my career.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDid you have any major mentors or musical<br />\ninfluences?<br />\nI had more than one teacher, of course. As for<br />\nconducting, I first had a very good teacher, Aedouard<br />\nLindeberg. He had a very strict form of grammar and an<br />\northodox technique. A musician of very strict discipline. I<br />\nam very grateful to him. He gave me the structure, and<br />\nthe need to be very careful with the scores. And the kind<br />\nof obligation of the professional. You always have to be<br />\nvery well prepared. For instance, you have to make<br />\nsacrifices for the career. I'll give you an example. It was a<br />\nbad winter. He told me,<br />\n'Tomorrow your lesson will be at<br />\nfive o'clock in the morning!' I<br />\nsaid, 'Well, you have to make<br />\nsacrifices.' So when I got there at<br />\nfive past five, he was already<br />\ndressed and shaved. He said,'You<br />\nare five minutes late.' He then<br />\ntold me,'Tomorrow you have to<br />\nlearn this.' But tomorrow I have<br />\nschool,' I protested, 'I have all<br />\nthis work.' He told me, 'You<br />\nmust be prepared because in this<br />\ncareer you have an emergency.<br />\nThe next night you might have to<br />\ngo on and perform something<br />\nwithout knowing the score. And<br />\nyou have to do it.' It was this<br />\nkind of human and psychological<br />\npreparation that was so<br />\nimportant.<br />\nThen I was influenced very<br />\nmuch by another conductor,<br />\nKonstantin Silvestri. He was very<br />\nimaginative. He was so colorful in<br />\nhis interpretations, just opposite<br />\nof Lindeberg. From him I learned<br />\nto take a piece of music and find<br />\nsomething beyond the notes, to<br />\ncreate something that even is not<br />\n.technically part of the text. And<br />\nanother conductor was George<br />\nGeorgscu. In fact, ilf_! was mv<br />\ntalent.<br />\nso-called very first influence. He was an enormous<br />\nwas<br />\nhe<br />\nwhy<br />\nhim<br />\nask<br />\nYou<br />\nperson.<br />\nHe was a very intuitive<br />\nit<br />\nlike<br />\nDo<br />\nit.<br />\nlike<br />\n'You<br />\nanswered,<br />\nhe<br />\nand<br />\ndoing it like this,<br />\nby nature to<br />\nthis.' He could motivate himself to conduct<br /><br />\nmake the music spontaneous. And from him I tried to<br />\nlearn this.<br />\nAnd, of course, you learn from everyone, hearing. Even<br />\nat my age, you hear all the time new things and you learn<br />\nthem. As with any professional. As if somehow it is<br />\ntomorrow that he starts his profession. And to be a<br />\nprofessional conductor, you have to learn from yourself.<br />\nThe most important teacher is yourself.<br />\nUntil I was thirty years old, I could not find myself. I<br />\nwas conducting sometimes like one of them. I realized at<br />\n30 that I was conducting in the style of my thinking. I<br />\nwas just a copy, trying to do what another conductor had<br />\ntaught me. I said, at thirty, that now was the time to try<br />\nto put it all together and try to build yourself. To<br />\ndiscover where is Commissiona in this combination. It<br />\ntook time, and by now, I think I have a good idea of my<br />\nconducting. My interpretation doesn't sound lilce<br />\nsomeone else.I influence. I do music my way.<br />\nWhen I conduct, I don't look at myself in the mirror.<br />\nAnd I don't prepare my choreography. It is very<br />\nspontaneous. I am reading the music very intensely during<br />\nmy conducting.I think that I can project more than with<br />\njust two hands or two fingers--with my whole body, with<br />\nmy vision and my face. If this helps for better<br />\nmusic-making than it is important. If it is for strictly<br />\nphysical appearance to influence the ladies than I should<br />\nsay that this is a fake, that it is not sincere. But I, on my<br />\nconscience, and all the Beethovens, all the Mahlers, all the<br />\nMozarts who I hope I will meet sometime in another<br />\nworld, they would testify that when I am doing their<br />\nmusic badly, that I am doing it sincerely.<br />\nCan you remember any childhood experiences<br />\nwhich were imporant to your musical background?<br />\nI was in the fire-brigade during the war. A youngster<br />\nbetween 13 and 16, during the bombardments, was set<br />\nout to watch with some official person, and to try to help<br />\nhim get a fire out. And I did. We were very young, but<br />\nvery scared for our lives.<br />\nI was in the street at the National Theatre, and we had<br />\nbeen sent to try to do something. It was such a terrifying,<br />\napocalyptic scene. I remember the detail&amp; very<br />\nBeautifully old-fashioned velvet, and this enormous hall<br />\nof marble. And I saw the fire as the end of my world, of<br />\nculture. And when I saw the piano, it was like I wanted to<br />\nsay good-bye to the music and good-bye to the culture.<br />\nAnd for a moment...it was a moment of...Host my fear. I<br />\nfelt that everyone is dying. People are dying. Music is<br />\ndying. I sat down and played the piano. Maybe it was<br />\nbeing young. An act of love for music. I remember this<br />\nvery well because it was such an apocalyptic scene. I<br />\ndidn't feel that the theatre was going, the street was<br />\ngoing. I felt that all the world finished in this moment.<br />\nAnyway, now I smile because it was an over-romantic<br /><br />\nmoment, hut we are all romantics in fact.<br />\nDo you have any favorite composers?<br />\nI say usually no, but in fact it is yes. I have a<br />\nparticular affection for Mahler. Of course, I'm changing,<br />\nbut for the last five years I have been very serious for<br />\nMahler. I adore all kinds of music. I don't like to diet in<br />\nmusic, to say I'm a specialist. I am doing things worse<br />\nthan others, but I am trying to be creative musically.<br />\nI think Ma!iler is very dear, since he has such an<br />\nenormous kaleidoscopic world in his music. He depicts<br />\nthe human emotions more, I think, than other composers.<br />\nThe misery and the happiness, the human side of life.<br />\nMahler is more than just an artist creating beautiful<br />\nthings, a symphony in four movements. It's a life story, a<br />\nbiography, a complete life span. He says in music a big<br />\nlove scene--romantic--but behind his mind there are so<br />\nmany othei things. The connection forrom his childhood.<br />\nHis birth, the marches, even the little vulgar things of the<br />\nstreet. It is an enormous world.<br />\nWere there any restrictions placed on your musical<br />\neducation in terms of what you learned and what you<br />\nwere able to conduct?<br />\nIn the training at the academy of music, we were<br />\navoided different kinds of music, styles, modern<br />\nrepertory. A certain part of Bartok was completely<br />\nunknown. Schoenberg and the twelve-tone music.<br />\nWebern. Of course, Cage and others were decadent<br />\nmusic. Even at certain times, Wagner was restricted<br />\nbecause Hitler liked Wagner. So in effect, we handled<br />\nmanuscripts of scores which came clandestinely. I<br />\nremember hearing Schoenberg and Bartok for the first<br />\ntime, very secretly. It was an enormous, fascinating<br />\ndiscovery. I don't know why; certainly the situation now<br />\nis better in Rumania. But my time was after the war. Also<br />\npart of the Baroque music was very little taught. When I<br />\ncame out of Rumania I knew very little of the Baroque<br />\nmusic. Certainly now it's changed. I know from my<br />\ncolleagues in Rumania that the education has changed.<br />\nThey are allowed, they are trained.<br />\nThere certainly were other reasons why I left Rumania.<br />\nPolitical freedom which I find very important. Freedom is<br />\nnot only to know Schoenberg or not, because in fact you<br />\ncan live without Schoenberg. But the life is not very good.<br />\nAs an artist, you are very well treated. You are getting<br />\nyour holidays and your vacations. Life is very nicely<br />\norganized. But as an individual, you are really destroyed.<br />\nYou are manipulated by other people, and they make<br />\nyour thinking, your judgment of what to conduct. Once a<br />\nyear I went to the Minister of Culture and got a list of<br />\nconcerts, where to conduct and what to conduct. If you<br />\nwant to live in your beautiful apartment and to avoid the<br />\nlife around you, okay. But I don't think that an artist is<br />\nhuman being who lives in his<br />\ntower. An artist, if he is a real<br />\nartist and wants to be in the<br />\nfront of his civilization, he<br />\ncannot get. for himself, getting<br />\nchampagne. It is a very artificial<br />\nlife. And it took a certain<br />\nnumber of years to learn to<br />\nbecome a free citizen.<br />\nro<br />\njudge for myself. To be<br />\ndemocratic. I think I'm a normal<br />\nhuman being, I try anyway. I like<br />\nto lead a normal life, enjoy life<br />\n.<br />\nlike others.<br />\nCo missiona held conducting<br />\nposts in Rumania, Israel, Sweden<br />\nand Ireland before coming to the<br />\nUnited States ten years ago- to<br />\niske his position in Baltimore.<br />\nNext week, he will discuss his<br />\nprofessional career in the U.S.,<br />\nand 'the elements which<br />\ncontributed to the radical<br />\ntransformation of the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony.<br /><br />\nSergiu Comissiona<br /><br />\nPAGE,<br /><br />\n1 NOVEMBER 3, 1978<br /><br />\nHandsome Dick<br />\nAnd The Tators<br />\ncont. from p. 14<br />\nThe resultant LP, Bloodbrothers, is unquestionably the<br />\ngroup's strongest effort to date.

After singing a grand total of one song on<br />\nthe first record and three on Manifest Destiny, Handsome<br />\nDick is now being allowed by Shernoff to handle all the<br />\nvocal chores by himself. His singing lessons have paid off.<br />\nThe tour de force on Bloodbrothers is \"I Stand Tall,- a<br />\npatriotic rocker that sums up the pleasures of living in the<br />\nU.S.A. thusly: \"Lots of pizza and ice-cold Cokes/Johnny<br />\nCarson telling jokes...\" This is landmark stuff! Don't be<br />\nsurprised if this song is soon adopted as the new national<br />\nanthem.<br />\nOn \"Faster and Louder,\" Manitoba boasts that he can<br />\nwalk, talk, sing, play, eat, and screw faster and louder<br />\nthan anyone else. Backed by a rapid-fire, no-frills rhythm<br />\nguitar onslaught, the guy is almost believable.<br />\nOther highlights on the LP include \"Borneo Jimmy,\"<br />\ndedicated to crazed rock writer R. Meltzer, and<br />\n\"Minnesota Strip,\" a song about hookers who migrate to<br />\nNew York from the Midwest. Shernoff seems to know<br />\ngate a bit about both subjects.<br />\nIn concert, the Dictators are simply amazing. I had the<br />\npleasure of attending one of their shows at the Bottom<br />\nLine in New York two weeks ago, and I was blown away.<br />\nHandsome Dick, slimmed down considerably, is, of<br />\ncourse, the focus of attention on stage, and his Blassie-like<br />\ngesturing and taunting of the audience members between<br />\nnumbers is truly comical. His strength lies in the fact that<br />\nyou just can't take him seriously.<br />\nConcentrating mainly on material from Bloodbrothers,<br />\nthe 'Tators surprised the crowd during one of their their<br />\nencores by bringing out Clarence Clemons of' the E.

The Big Man's soaring sax complemented the<br />\nrelentless guitar attack and brought the audience to its<br />\nfeet for the remainder of the show.<br />\nI left the Bottom Line feeling completely drained, and<br />\nknowing that I had witnessed one of America's premiere<br />\n'rock bands.

Sonny Mills,<br />\nBob \"Muff\" Divers, Ken Bess,<br />\nSteve Wey,and Tom Bender have<br />\nreflected a deep dedication and<br />\nunending commitment to<br />\nfootball at Hopkins. That's no<br />\nsmall accomplishment.<br />\nSince fall lacrosse was<br />\ninstituted here, these Blue Jay<br />\ngridders have suffered enough<br />\nlosses to discourage the strongest<br />\nof spirits from ever picking up<br />\npigskin again. But they kept on<br />\nplugging through thick and thin<br />\nand deserved that win more than<br />\nanyone else.<br />\nSonny Mills., one of the<br />\ntri-captains, is a good-natured<br />\nguy and a great public relations<br />\nman. He celebrated his last game<br />\nbefore the home crowd with a<br />\ncouplet of quarterback sacks.<br />\nSteve Wey, another tri-captain<br />\nwho doubles as an excellent,<br />\nversatile varsity lacrosse player,<br /><br />\nalso popped through the line a<br />\ncouple of times to pull down<br />\nMoravian's QB. To round out this<br />\ntri-captaincy, Ken Bess has been<br />\nthe most consistent backfield<br />\nstarter for JHU. On the field<br />\nSaturday he epitomized the spirit<br />\nof each of these five veterans. Big<br />\nBob \"Muff\" Divers took on the<br />\nmost unglamorous position in<br />\nfootball as guard and pounded<br />\naway valiantly for four years.<br />\nFinally Tom \"Bert\" Bender did<br />\ndouble-duty on both ends of the<br />\npassing unit through the years.<br />\nAt a school where football is<br />\nfar from the sport and where<br />\nstudent support amounts to close<br />\nto nothing, it takes something<br />\nextra to pump yourself up before<br />\nevery game: an inner drive and a<br />\nfirm commitment to your team<br />\nand to your teammates.<br />\nNow with the addition of new,<br />\npromising faces on the team<br />\nroster like Jim Margraff, Jeff<br />\nHarris and Bill Stromberg, .the<br />\nfive old-timers can count<br />\nthemselves as the links to the<br />\npossible revival of football at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIt has been a demanding,<br />\nfrustrating four years, to say the<br />\nleast.
