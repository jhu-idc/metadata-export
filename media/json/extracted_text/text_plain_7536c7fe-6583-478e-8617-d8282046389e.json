The writer ably attempts to<br />\nshow how harmful graduate lacrosse would be to Johns Hopkins.<br />\nHe grants that the team would be beneficial to our alumni, but on<br />\nv<br />\nthe grounds that it would be a better team, playing bigger games<br />\nand drawing larger support, maintains that it will diminish the<br />\nif<br />\nSS,<br />\nstudents<br />\ninterest in the game and so hurt the 'varsity. For the<br />\n.<br />\nV<br />\nmoment, granting for the sake of argument that the graduates would<br />\nplay better lacrosse with more important teams and so have larger<br />\nattendance it does not follow that they would diminish the student's interest. Our correspondent overlooks the fact that from the very nature of the game any man with red blood in<br />\nhis veins will want to see more lacrosse the more he sees.<br />\nBut is it at all sure that the alumni will play the better game? Is not Mt. Washington<br />\na largely Hopkins alumni team, and who says they are better than the stickmen of black and<br />\nblue? Moreover, the crowd-drawing ability of any alumni team is always doubtful. In the<br />\nNorth, alumni baseball and hockey teams of the large universities do not draw handfuls compared to varsity games. It is the varsity that defends the honor of our alma mater, it is the<br />\nvarsity over whom alumnus and undergraduate will cheer themselvess voiceless, it is the<br />\nvarsity that incidentally will get the big gate receipts.<br />\nTherefore, let us support the graduate team, for it will bring many benefits and its<br />\ndrawbacks cannot be seen with a spy-glass.<br />\n<br />\n2;2;2<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nE print in this issue pictures and a descriptive article related to the<br />\nsun-dial recently erected at Homewood by the Class of 1908. To say<br />\nthat 1908 has done a commemdable work would be superfluous. We do<br />\nnot think it out of place, however, to cite this as another manifestation of what we feel sure is a growing interest among the alumni.<br />\n1908 is the first class. We feel sure that other classes, not only<br />\nthose to come, but those graduated years ago, will seek to perpetuate<br />\ntheir memories in some equally fitting way.<br />\nThus the old classes will be brought into closer touch with one<br />\nanother, and with the university, to the betterment of themselves<br />\nand it.<br />\nOne great admitted obstacle to the advancement of this institution has been lack of<br />\nalumni support.<br />\nIt looks as if the much-talked-of reunion had started the ball rolling. 1908's influence is,<br />\nby virtue of their pernament monument, sure to be a lasting one. Let the good work go on.<br />\n<br />\nGoing right after that championship.<br />\n<br />\nThere is \"some class\" to that debating team.<br />\n<br />\nSTEP was certainly taken in the right direction when Mr. Frey of<br />\nthe senior class collected and published all the Hopkins songs in a<br />\nbook. This book is most attractively gotten up both without and<br />\nwithin, and when it made its debut the afternoon of the Harvard<br />\ngame was much admired and sought after. It contains the University ode, Veritas l'os Liberabit, (not as the daily paper published,<br />\nVentus Vos Liberabit), Our Alma Mater in Dixie Land, We're Here<br />\n*********** \u2022<br />\nto Win Again Hopkins, and numerous others.<br />\n\u2022 rigtV:<br />\nThe most gratifying aspect in the publishing of this book, how**<br />\nz<br />\never, is that it shows that the Hopkins spirit, awakened last fall by<br />\nthe alumni reunion and the St. Johns game has not been slumbering. It demonstrates that<br />\nthe flesh as well as the spirit is willing, and that whenever a practical suggestion is made<br />\nby the alumni\u2014for the alumni conceived the thought of publishing such a book at Hopkins\u2014<br />\nsome student is waiting to take the matter up and push it through.<br />\n:. \u2022v<br />\n4PrIggil<br />\nIiiviFvvvv*<br />\n*<br />\ni': 1<br />\n*<br />\nV<br />\nlig*<br />\n10<br />\n:<br />\nAv.<br />\nV'<br />\ni<br />\nV<br />\n*<br />\nIF 4es<br />\n<br />\nCongratulations Dr. Magoffin.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Bobbit is a worthy member of this University.<br />\n<br />\nWe should be presumptions indeed, were we to attempt to criticise, favorably or<br />\nadversely, the lectures delivered during the past fortnight by Dr. Lowell. We can, however.<br />\npoint to the high position soon to be occupied by him in the educational world, and say, with<br />\nthe undergraduate body, that we are deeply sensible of the honor which he has conferred upon<br />\nthis University by lecturing here at this time.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nOUT OF THE DEPTHS.<br />\na<br />\nIt was disagreeable Sunday afternoon in<br />\nthe down town district. A cold, penetrating<br />\nmist filled the air, dampening one's clothes,<br />\nand making icy chills run up and down one's<br />\nspine. The streets, always thronged with a<br />\nbusy, hurrying crowd on week days, were<br />\nnow almost deserted. The few pedestrians<br />\nthat were about seemed in a hurry to get to<br />\ntheir destinations, where warmth and comfort<br />\nundoubtedly awaited them.<br />\nWith one of these pedestrians, however, this<br />\nwas not the case. He was slouching along<br />\nwith a slow, uncertain step that certainly did<br />\nnot belong to a man who was bound for<br />\nwarmth and happiness. It was the step of a<br />\nman who is discouraged; who has tried the<br />\nworld and found it harsh and cruel; who despairs of ever attaining that goal of his fellow<br />\npedestrians\u2014warmth, comfort, and happiness.<br />\nHe slouched along, block after block, and<br />\nfinally came to a bridge over a stream of dull,<br />\nleaden water. He couched into a protected<br />\ncorner, where a building extended within the<br />\niron railing, and looked down into the filthy,<br />\nslow-moving stream. As he looked, the<br />\nwaters gradually faded away, and in their<br />\nplace he saw a cozy, little sitting-room with<br />\nan open fireplace. The green logs hissed and<br />\ncrackled and the leaping flames cast a ruddy<br />\nglow upon the worn, wrinkled faces of an old<br />\nman and woman. At length this vision faded<br />\naway, and the ragged crouching man with a<br />\nshapeless slouched-hat pulled down over his<br />\nface began to mutter, ``I wonder if they are<br />\nthere now. What would they think if they<br />\ncould see me now; if they could know what I<br />\nhave done, and where I have been since I left<br />\nthem?\" Then another vision took shape before him. This time it was not a warm cheerful picture, but a grim, cheerless one. This<br />\ntime he saw the narrow walls of a prison cell;<br />\nthe steel walls, the steel floor, the steel ceiling,<br />\nthe steel door. He heard the endless shuffle<br />\nand scraping of feet down the corridor. With<br />\na shudder he drew his hand across his eyes,<br />\ncrouched lower into the corner, and gave himself up to despair.<br />\n\"What's the use of trying?\" he thought;<br />\n\"nobody wants to have anything to do with<br />\nme. I know I have done wrong, but God<br />\nknows how dearly I have paid for it. For<br />\n<br />\nover a month I have tried to get work; but<br />\nnobody want me. They all tell me to get<br />\nout.\" With a sob he looked down into the<br />\ndark water. As he looked it seemed to become less and less repugnant to him. There<br />\nglided peace, perhaps annihilation.<br />\nAs these thoughts were stealing into his<br />\nbrain, a heavy hand clutched him by the<br />\nshoulder, jerked him up, and pushed him<br />\nalong. A rough, grumbling voice burst out,<br />\n\"Come on now, get along there. This is no<br />\nplace for you.\" So with slow, uncertain steps<br />\nhe slouched on up the street.<br />\nHe pulled his coat-collar up about his bare<br />\nneck to protect it from the cold and rain.<br />\nThen, with his head bent down, his shoulders<br />\nhunched, and his hands thrust deep into his<br />\npockets, he walked square after square.<br />\nFinally, he noticed a number of men turning<br />\nup into a side street, and, almost without<br />\nthinking, he followed them. He saw them<br />\nenter the open doors of a large theatre, and<br />\nwondered what they could be doing in such a<br />\nplace on Sunday. Then he noticed a sign\u2014<br />\n\"Men's Meeting. All welcome.\"<br />\n\"Well, here is a place where I can at least<br />\nbe warm,\" he thought; so he slouched into<br />\nthe theatre.<br />\nThe young usher who met him just within<br />\nthe threshold seemed doubtful at first whether<br />\nto admit him. A person with such a rough,<br />\nunshaven face, such bloodshot eyes, such<br />\ntousled hair, such dirty clothing might be a<br />\ndisturbing element in the meeting; so the<br />\nusher was about to turn him away. Then he<br />\nremembered the words of the evangelist, \"Let<br />\nevery one come, no matter how rough and<br />\nwretched he looks. There is always room for<br />\nthe repentant sinner.\" So he stepped aside,<br />\nand let the outcast enter; then led the way to<br />\na seat in an obscure corner at the side of the<br />\nhouse.<br />\n'Well, this is comfort,' the outcast thought,<br />\nas he sank back into the chair, and felt a<br />\nwarm, glowing sensation steal over him. He<br />\ndid not see the great audience of men, nor the<br />\nstage filled with singers; he let his head fall<br />\nupon his chest, and gave himself up to comfort. The men sitting near cast annoyed<br />\nglances in his direction, when they heard his<br />\nheavy breathing; but, when they saw his<br />\nrough face and tattered clothing, they did not<br />\ndisturb him.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nDuring the first part of the meeting he sat father; when they trusted all mankind; when<br />\nand slept. His sleep was not peaceful, how- there was no evil in their hearts.<br />\n\"I know of one man who looked back. He<br />\never, for occasional frowns, caused by hideous<br />\ndreams of drunkeness, crime and prison cells, was a man high up in political life, a man<br />\ndarkened his face. How long he slept he did who was respected by every one. But there<br />\nnot know; but, finally, out of that chaos of came a time in his life when he found himmental images there came a clear, silvery self becoming hardened; when the world<br />\nvoice. Listening attentively, he recognized seemed to lose interest for him. In one of his<br />\nan old hymn that they used to sing at the despondent moods he looked back over his<br />\nwoods camp-meetings. .He opened his eyes, childhood days. He thought of his dear old<br />\nand looked in the direction from which the mother; of how she used to comfort him when<br />\nmusic came. There was a woman singing. he was troubled. So he made up his mind to<br />\nShe was dressed in black, and had a sad, go back home to her, and regain himself.

When he woke up the<br />\nevery note.<br />\nand<br />\nhe<br />\nthought,<br />\nsong,\"<br />\nold<br />\nnext morning, he was a new man; ready to<br />\n\"Yes, it's the<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\nrefrain<br />\nwords<br />\nface the world again with a new purpose in<br />\nas she played on, the<br />\nacan<br />\nhis heart.<br />\ncame to his mind, and he whispered<br />\ncompaniment to the cornet\u2014<br />\n'I will tell you another story, this time of a<br />\nlifeline,<br />\nout<br />\nthe<br />\nthrow<br />\nlifeline,<br />\nboy who died a criminal.

He<br />\ngrasped the back of the seat in front of him,<br />\nand stood erect.<br />\nThe evangelist looked at him, for he was<br />\nthe only man standing. \"God bless you my<br />\nman,\" he said. Immediately others, influenced by his example, arose, and declared<br />\ntheir purpose with him. The very usher who<br />\nhad hesitated whether to admit him came to<br />\nhim, took him by the hand, and led him back<br />\nupon the stage to meet the evangelist, who<br />\nwas waiting to speak with him.<br />\n\"Is there anything I can do to help you?\"<br />\nhe asked.<br />\n\"You've already done everything for me,\"<br />\ncame the response. \"Before I came in here,<br />\nI was tempted to plunge into the depths; but<br />\nnow I am going to start out again.

But the Giant scowled again,<br />\nand bustled Away. Then did the poor Man<br />\npress his hand to his Fevered Brow. He<br />\nshuffled back to consult the Fairy. But she<br />\ncould only smile sweetly and say, \"Cheer<br />\nup!\" So the poor Man gave up his Toys,<br />\nstumbled downs the stairs, out again into the<br />\nOpen Air.

From an Alumni point of<br />\nview it is a very good thing. It gathers together old friends and gives to those of the<br />\nAlumni who are cooped up in offices during<br />\nthe day a chance for exercise. As viewed in<br />\nthe light of the undergraduate the situation<br />\nis entirely different. The Alumni team will<br />\nbe the better team. It will play better teams<br />\nand draw larger crowds than the 'varsity. By<br />\nso doing it will diminish the students interest<br />\nin the game; and the only athletic organization in which the University has ever excelled<br />\nwill be obscured.<br />\nThe Alumni contend that such will not be<br />\nthe case, and that the Alumni games will not<br />\nbe played until after the 'varsity season.<br />\nGranting this, the same Alumnus says nothing<br />\nabout one or two of the big teams being reserved for the Alumni. For instance the<br />\nUniversity of Toronto has no game with the<br />\n'varsity this year, but is reserved for the<br />\nAlumni.<br />\nIf the former football stars of Yale and<br />\nHarvard were gathered together into respective Alumni teams, who could estimate the<br />\nattendance and enthusiasm of an annual contest. Who could deny that the respective<br />\n'varsities would be eclipsed.<br />\nThe enrollment of a college or university<br />\ndepends largely upon the advertisement it receives through a medium of its athletic teams.<br />\nThe average preparatory school boy judges an<br />\n<br />\ninstitution solely by the success of its athletic<br />\nteams.

The usual wolf-cry about the<br />\nlosses of graduation and its echo about the<br />\npoor quality of the new material was duly<br />\nsounded, and we have all been duly scared.<br />\nBut the new men have rounded into shape<br />\nunder the skillful tutelage of .`the old war<br />\nhorse,\" Bill Schmeisser, and the team of<br />\n1909 seems in fair way, not only of having<br />\nthe championship banner in the Trophy<br />\nRoom, but also of going down in history as a<br />\nnoteworthy team.<br />\nThis does not, however, mean that the<br />\ngame they are now playing is to the complete<br />\nsatisfaction either of their coaches or of their<br />\nundergraduate supporters. We at Hopkins<br />\nlook for a team that plays Hopkins lacrosse\u2014<br />\na game that is famous the country over\u2014and<br />\nthere is no doubt but that the team this year<br />\nat times falls below this high standard. The<br />\nseason is not over, however, and by the time<br />\nit is finished we are confident the team will be<br />\nan equal to our - best.<br />\nThe stick work is at times ragged, passing<br />\nnot all that it should be, and an inclination to<br />\n<br />\ntake things a bit easy on the part of the<br />\nattack is, in some cases, noticeable. The<br />\nloafing has no doubt been due to the easy<br />\ncharacter of the games we have had to play,<br />\nand the stick work is also largely due to pure<br />\ncarelessness.<br />\nThe season opened with a game with the<br />\nMidshipmen at Annapolis. To the large<br />\nband of Hopkins followers who went down to<br />\nsee the opening game it was an uninteresting,<br />\none-sided contest. It showed the reliability<br />\nof the old stars and demonstrated the effectiveness of the attack. At the end of the first<br />\nhalf we had the very comfortable score of six<br />\nto nothing, and in the second period, in accordance with our usual policy, the attack let<br />\nup and substitutes were placed in many<br />\npositions. The Navy succeeded in placing<br />\nthe ball in the net twice during the half when<br />\nthey had the ball in our defensive territory<br />\nmost of the time. The final score was Johns<br />\nHopkins, 7; Navy, 2.<br />\nNext came the widely advertised '`Champions of the North\" with their crimson<br />\nstockings and their black satin running<br />\ntrunks. Harvard had been touted in the<br />\npapers as ``the real thing\" in the lacrosse<br />\nline, and a great crowd came out to Homewood. But disappointment alike greeted the<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nmen from Cambridge and those of us who<br />\nlooked for a fast, bard game. At times'Harvard played brilliant lacrosse, and at times<br />\nHopkins made messy plays, but the final<br />\nscore of eleven to one gives a fair idea of how<br />\nmuch of a contest the game was.<br />\nOne of the prettiest demonstrations of<br />\nscoring ability ever seen in Baltimore was in<br />\nthe first of the second half when Hopkins<br />\nshot four goals inside of three minutes of<br />\nplay. The game gave our attack good shooting practice. but our defense hardly had to<br />\nexert itself at all.<br />\nThe third game, and the first one of our<br />\nleague contests, was also something of a surprise, but on the other side of the house, for<br />\nLehigh came down here with the reputation<br />\nof being about a \"five-to-one-shot,\" thanks<br />\n<br />\nTHE DEBATE.<br />\nThe debate between Washington and Lee<br />\nand Johns Hopkins was a very successful<br />\naffair. The Hopkins speakers were Marvel,<br />\nFisher, and Harrison, while Russell acted as<br />\nalternate. Mr. Kaylor, the chairman of the<br />\nWashington and Lee Team, made a remarkably good speech and was enjoyed more by<br />\nthe audience than any other speaker. The<br />\nHopkins men won mainly upon the merit of<br />\ntheir arguments and were not quite so much<br />\nat home on their feet as their opponents.<br />\nJudge Stockbridge delivered the decision of<br />\nthe judges and all went away, satisfied that<br />\nthere had occurred a good debate. The question was, \"Resolved, That our policy be<br />\nshaped towards the abandonment of the protective tariff.\"<br />\n<br />\nto their defeat at Columbia's hands. They,<br />\nhowever, put up a game take, for the first few<br />\nminutes took our team and our rooters off<br />\ntheir feet. They scored two goals in short<br />\norder, but the black and blue men soon struck<br />\ntheir pace and carried the game away. It<br />\nwas a hard-fought battle from whistle to<br />\nwhistle, and kept the grandstands in a howl<br />\nall the time. Penalties were frequent, and<br />\nhardly a man on either team came out without some little souvenir to remind him he had<br />\nbeen in the game. The game was hard<br />\nfought, and again showed Hopkins ability to<br />\ncome back with more in the second period and<br />\nfinish strong. The scoreboard when the<br />\nfinal whistle blew read: Johns Hopkins, 6;<br />\nLehigh, 2.<br />\nIn the games so far played, Hopkins has<br />\nrolled up twenty-four points while our<br />\nopponents (Navy, Harvard and Lehigh)<br />\ncombined have only gotten the ball past our<br />\ngoal-keeper five times.<br />\n<br />\nIn patronizing our advertisers, please mention the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n\u2014Ai<br />\n<br />\n\f11<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n.0txxxxxtsgx 31<br />\n164 XX X.% le x X lrist x<br />\n<br />\n\u2014<br />\n4+tx:xxxxxxx*AgxxxxiczAitaticii4sigiclEx24443tx,<br />\n4.<br />\nlit1,3t!tailatilist stick 1..X11.361[Itft.liaritisrat.icititItft.X.I.30tag3,4<br />\n<br />\nX%<br />\nIt%<br />\n11%<br />\nx<br />\n1116<br />\natsat<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\niwiA4<br />\n<br />\nTURKISH<br />\nCIGARETTES<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n4*/<br />\n4*11<br />\n4% al<br />\nCita<br />\nt XIS<br />\n<br />\n.)<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nwon their success<br />\namong college<br />\nmen entirely on<br />\ntheir merits.<br />\nTheir sales grew<br />\nas smokers \"found<br />\nout\" how good<br />\nthey are.

It is a handsome<br />\nsun-dial, built by the Class of 1908, and placed<br />\nat the West end of the Botanical Gardens.<br />\nThe plans for the new grounds call for but<br />\none sun-dial,and \"1908,\"with customary progressiveness, saw to it that that one sun-dial should<br />\nbe erected by them.<br />\nSteps were first taken at the end of last year,<br />\nwhen the President of the class, Mr. Purdon<br />\nWright, appointed a committee consisting of<br />\nMessrs. Julian Ridgely, Daniel Miller, and<br />\nRalph Williams, to take charge of the matter.<br />\nZealous work by the committee has resulted<br />\nin the completion of the dial, which is now on<br />\nview.<br />\nThe dial itself, which is the work of Messrs. Emmert and Ellicott, architects, consists<br />\nof a four-foot marble shaft, of beautiful lines, mounted on a concrete base four feet square.<br />\nThe top is brass, and is set flush with the top of the shaft.<br />\nAround the base of the structure is the following legend:<br />\n\"Erected by the Class of 1908.\"<br />\nThe actual erection was done by Wm.

Makel, Johns Ilopkins<br /><br />\nUniversity, Baltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nN this issue we take pleasure in printing a letter we have received<br />\nWgratEttg<br />\nfrom one who signed himself '`Undergraduate\" on the important<br />\nvniv**Igvv*Ar .<br />\nV 3,<br />\nquestion of an alumni lacrosse team. The writer ably attempts to<br />\nshow how harmful graduate lacrosse would be to Johns Hopkins.<br />\nHe grants that the team would be beneficial to our alumni, but on<br />\nv<br />\nthe grounds that it would be a better team, playing bigger games<br />\nand drawing larger support, maintains that it will diminish the<br />\nif<br />\nSS,<br />\nstudents<br />\ninterest in the game and so hurt the 'varsity. For the<br />\n.<br />\nV<br />\nmoment, granting for the sake of argument that the graduates would<br />\nplay better lacrosse with more important teams and so have larger<br />\nattendance it does not follow that they would diminish the student's interest. Our correspondent overlooks the fact that from the very nature of the game any man with red blood in<br />\nhis veins will want to see more lacrosse the more he sees.<br />\nBut is it at all sure that the alumni will play the better game? Is not Mt. Washington<br />\na largely Hopkins alumni team, and who says they are better than the stickmen of black and<br />\nblue? Moreover, the crowd-drawing ability of any alumni team is always doubtful. In the<br />\nNorth, alumni baseball and hockey teams of the large universities do not draw handfuls compared to varsity games. It is the varsity that defends the honor of our alma mater, it is the<br />\nvarsity over whom alumnus and undergraduate will cheer themselvess voiceless, it is the<br />\nvarsity that incidentally will get the big gate receipts.<br />\nTherefore, let us support the graduate team, for it will bring many benefits and its<br />\ndrawbacks cannot be seen with a spy-glass.<br /><br />\n2;2;2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nE print in this issue pictures and a descriptive article related to the<br />\nsun-dial recently erected at Homewood by the Class of 1908. To say<br />\nthat 1908 has done a commemdable work would be superfluous. We do<br />\nnot think it out of place, however, to cite this as another manifestation of what we feel sure is a growing interest among the alumni.<br />\n1908 is the first class. We feel sure that other classes, not only<br />\nthose to come, but those graduated years ago, will seek to perpetuate<br />\ntheir memories in some equally fitting way.<br />\nThus the old classes will be brought into closer touch with one<br />\nanother, and with the university, to the betterment of themselves<br />\nand it.<br />\nOne great admitted obstacle to the advancement of this institution has been lack of<br />\nalumni support.<br />\nIt looks as if the much-talked-of reunion had started the ball rolling. 1908's influence is,<br />\nby virtue of their pernament monument, sure to be a lasting one. Let the good work go on.<br /><br />\nGoing right after that championship.<br /><br />\nThere is \"some class\" to that debating team.<br /><br />\nSTEP was certainly taken in the right direction when Mr. Frey of<br />\nthe senior class collected and published all the Hopkins songs in a<br />\nbook. This book is most attractively gotten up both without and<br />\nwithin, and when it made its debut the afternoon of the Harvard<br />\ngame was much admired and sought after. It contains the University ode, Veritas l'os Liberabit, (not as the daily paper published,<br />\nVentus Vos Liberabit), Our Alma Mater in Dixie Land, We're Here<br />\n*********** \u2022<br />\nto Win Again Hopkins, and numerous others.<br />\n\u2022 rigtV:<br />\nThe most gratifying aspect in the publishing of this book, how**<br />\nz<br />\never, is that it shows that the Hopkins spirit, awakened last fall by<br />\nthe alumni reunion and the St. Johns game has not been slumbering. It demonstrates that<br />\nthe flesh as well as the spirit is willing, and that whenever a practical suggestion is made<br />\nby the alumni\u2014for the alumni conceived the thought of publishing such a book at Hopkins\u2014<br />\nsome student is waiting to take the matter up and push it through.<br />\n:. \u2022v<br />\n4PrIggil<br />\nIiiviFvvvv*<br />\n*<br />\ni': 1<br />\n*<br />\nV<br />\nlig*<br />\n10<br />\n:<br />\nAv.<br />\nV'<br />\ni<br />\nV<br />\n*<br />\nIF 4es<br /><br />\nCongratulations Dr. Magoffin.<br /><br />\nMr. Bobbit is a worthy member of this University.<br /><br />\nWe should be presumptions indeed, were we to attempt to criticise, favorably or<br />\nadversely, the lectures delivered during the past fortnight by Dr. Lowell. We can, however.<br />\npoint to the high position soon to be occupied by him in the educational world, and say, with<br />\nthe undergraduate body, that we are deeply sensible of the honor which he has conferred upon<br />\nthis University by lecturing here at this time.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nOUT OF THE DEPTHS.<br />\na<br />\nIt was disagreeable Sunday afternoon in<br />\nthe down town district. A cold, penetrating<br />\nmist filled the air, dampening one's clothes,<br />\nand making icy chills run up and down one's<br />\nspine. The streets, always thronged with a<br />\nbusy, hurrying crowd on week days, were<br />\nnow almost deserted. The few pedestrians<br />\nthat were about seemed in a hurry to get to<br />\ntheir destinations, where warmth and comfort<br />\nundoubtedly awaited them.<br />\nWith one of these pedestrians, however, this<br />\nwas not the case. He was slouching along<br />\nwith a slow, uncertain step that certainly did<br />\nnot belong to a man who was bound for<br />\nwarmth and happiness. It was the step of a<br />\nman who is discouraged; who has tried the<br />\nworld and found it harsh and cruel; who despairs of ever attaining that goal of his fellow<br />\npedestrians\u2014warmth, comfort, and happiness.<br />\nHe slouched along, block after block, and<br />\nfinally came to a bridge over a stream of dull,<br />\nleaden water. He couched into a protected<br />\ncorner, where a building extended within the<br />\niron railing, and looked down into the filthy,<br />\nslow-moving stream. As he looked, the<br />\nwaters gradually faded away, and in their<br />\nplace he saw a cozy, little sitting-room with<br />\nan open fireplace. The green logs hissed and<br />\ncrackled and the leaping flames cast a ruddy<br />\nglow upon the worn, wrinkled faces of an old<br />\nman and woman. At length this vision faded<br />\naway, and the ragged crouching man with a<br />\nshapeless slouched-hat pulled down over his<br />\nface began to mutter, ``I wonder if they are<br />\nthere now. What would they think if they<br />\ncould see me now; if they could know what I<br />\nhave done, and where I have been since I left<br />\nthem?\" Then another vision took shape before him. This time it was not a warm cheerful picture, but a grim, cheerless one. This<br />\ntime he saw the narrow walls of a prison cell;<br />\nthe steel walls, the steel floor, the steel ceiling,<br />\nthe steel door. He heard the endless shuffle<br />\nand scraping of feet down the corridor. With<br />\na shudder he drew his hand across his eyes,<br />\ncrouched lower into the corner, and gave himself up to despair.<br />\n\"What's the use of trying?\" he thought;<br />\n\"nobody wants to have anything to do with<br />\nme. I know I have done wrong, but God<br />\nknows how dearly I have paid for it. For<br /><br />\nover a month I have tried to get work; but<br />\nnobody want me. They all tell me to get<br />\nout.\" With a sob he looked down into the<br />\ndark water. As he looked it seemed to become less and less repugnant to him. There<br />\nglided peace, perhaps annihilation.<br />\nAs these thoughts were stealing into his<br />\nbrain, a heavy hand clutched him by the<br />\nshoulder, jerked him up, and pushed him<br />\nalong. A rough, grumbling voice burst out,<br />\n\"Come on now, get along there. This is no<br />\nplace for you.\" So with slow, uncertain steps<br />\nhe slouched on up the street.<br />\nHe pulled his coat-collar up about his bare<br />\nneck to protect it from the cold and rain.<br />\nThen, with his head bent down, his shoulders<br />\nhunched, and his hands thrust deep into his<br />\npockets, he walked square after square.<br />\nFinally, he noticed a number of men turning<br />\nup into a side street, and, almost without<br />\nthinking, he followed them. He saw them<br />\nenter the open doors of a large theatre, and<br />\nwondered what they could be doing in such a<br />\nplace on Sunday. Then he noticed a sign\u2014<br />\n\"Men's Meeting. All welcome.\"<br />\n\"Well, here is a place where I can at least<br />\nbe warm,\" he thought; so he slouched into<br />\nthe theatre.<br />\nThe young usher who met him just within<br />\nthe threshold seemed doubtful at first whether<br />\nto admit him. A person with such a rough,<br />\nunshaven face, such bloodshot eyes, such<br />\ntousled hair, such dirty clothing might be a<br />\ndisturbing element in the meeting; so the<br />\nusher was about to turn him away. Then he<br />\nremembered the words of the evangelist, \"Let<br />\nevery one come, no matter how rough and<br />\nwretched he looks. There is always room for<br />\nthe repentant sinner.\" So he stepped aside,<br />\nand let the outcast enter; then led the way to<br />\na seat in an obscure corner at the side of the<br />\nhouse.<br />\n'Well, this is comfort,' the outcast thought,<br />\nas he sank back into the chair, and felt a<br />\nwarm, glowing sensation steal over him. He<br />\ndid not see the great audience of men, nor the<br />\nstage filled with singers; he let his head fall<br />\nupon his chest, and gave himself up to comfort. The men sitting near cast annoyed<br />\nglances in his direction, when they heard his<br />\nheavy breathing; but, when they saw his<br />\nrough face and tattered clothing, they did not<br />\ndisturb him.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nDuring the first part of the meeting he sat father; when they trusted all mankind; when<br />\nand slept. His sleep was not peaceful, how- there was no evil in their hearts.<br />\n\"I know of one man who looked back.

Immediately others, influenced by his example, arose, and declared<br />\ntheir purpose with him. The very usher who<br />\nhad hesitated whether to admit him came to<br />\nhim, took him by the hand, and led him back<br />\nupon the stage to meet the evangelist, who<br />\nwas waiting to speak with him.<br />\n\"Is there anything I can do to help you?\"<br />\nhe asked.<br />\n\"You've already done everything for me,\"<br />\ncame the response. \"Before I came in here,<br />\nI was tempted to plunge into the depths; but<br />\nnow I am going to start out again.

But she<br />\ncould only smile sweetly and say, \"Cheer<br />\nup!\" So the poor Man gave up his Toys,<br />\nstumbled downs the stairs, out again into the<br />\nOpen Air.

From an Alumni point of<br />\nview it is a very good thing. It gathers together old friends and gives to those of the<br />\nAlumni who are cooped up in offices during<br />\nthe day a chance for exercise. As viewed in<br />\nthe light of the undergraduate the situation<br />\nis entirely different. The Alumni team will<br />\nbe the better team. It will play better teams<br />\nand draw larger crowds than the 'varsity. By<br />\nso doing it will diminish the students interest<br />\nin the game; and the only athletic organization in which the University has ever excelled<br />\nwill be obscured.<br />\nThe Alumni contend that such will not be<br />\nthe case, and that the Alumni games will not<br />\nbe played until after the 'varsity season.<br />\nGranting this, the same Alumnus says nothing<br />\nabout one or two of the big teams being reserved for the Alumni. For instance the<br />\nUniversity of Toronto has no game with the<br />\n'varsity this year, but is reserved for the<br />\nAlumni.<br />\nIf the former football stars of Yale and<br />\nHarvard were gathered together into respective Alumni teams, who could estimate the<br />\nattendance and enthusiasm of an annual contest.

The usual wolf-cry about the<br />\nlosses of graduation and its echo about the<br />\npoor quality of the new material was duly<br />\nsounded, and we have all been duly scared.<br />\nBut the new men have rounded into shape<br />\nunder the skillful tutelage of .`the old war<br />\nhorse,\" Bill Schmeisser, and the team of<br />\n1909 seems in fair way, not only of having<br />\nthe championship banner in the Trophy<br />\nRoom, but also of going down in history as a<br />\nnoteworthy team.<br />\nThis does not, however, mean that the<br />\ngame they are now playing is to the complete<br />\nsatisfaction either of their coaches or of their<br />\nundergraduate supporters. We at Hopkins<br />\nlook for a team that plays Hopkins lacrosse\u2014<br />\na game that is famous the country over\u2014and<br />\nthere is no doubt but that the team this year<br />\nat times falls below this high standard. The<br />\nseason is not over, however, and by the time<br />\nit is finished we are confident the team will be<br />\nan equal to our - best.<br />\nThe stick work is at times ragged, passing<br />\nnot all that it should be, and an inclination to<br /><br />\ntake things a bit easy on the part of the<br />\nattack is, in some cases, noticeable. The<br />\nloafing has no doubt been due to the easy<br />\ncharacter of the games we have had to play,<br />\nand the stick work is also largely due to pure<br />\ncarelessness.<br />\nThe season opened with a game with the<br />\nMidshipmen at Annapolis. To the large<br />\nband of Hopkins followers who went down to<br />\nsee the opening game it was an uninteresting,<br />\none-sided contest. It showed the reliability<br />\nof the old stars and demonstrated the effectiveness of the attack. At the end of the first<br />\nhalf we had the very comfortable score of six<br />\nto nothing, and in the second period, in accordance with our usual policy, the attack let<br />\nup and substitutes were placed in many<br />\npositions. The Navy succeeded in placing<br />\nthe ball in the net twice during the half when<br />\nthey had the ball in our defensive territory<br />\nmost of the time. The final score was Johns<br />\nHopkins, 7; Navy, 2.<br />\nNext came the widely advertised '`Champions of the North\" with their crimson<br />\nstockings and their black satin running<br />\ntrunks. Harvard had been touted in the<br />\npapers as ``the real thing\" in the lacrosse<br />\nline, and a great crowd came out to Homewood. But disappointment alike greeted the<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nmen from Cambridge and those of us who<br />\nlooked for a fast, bard game. At times'Harvard played brilliant lacrosse, and at times<br />\nHopkins made messy plays, but the final<br />\nscore of eleven to one gives a fair idea of how<br />\nmuch of a contest the game was.<br />\nOne of the prettiest demonstrations of<br />\nscoring ability ever seen in Baltimore was in<br />\nthe first of the second half when Hopkins<br />\nshot four goals inside of three minutes of<br />\nplay. The game gave our attack good shooting practice. but our defense hardly had to<br />\nexert itself at all.<br />\nThe third game, and the first one of our<br />\nleague contests, was also something of a surprise, but on the other side of the house, for<br />\nLehigh came down here with the reputation<br />\nof being about a \"five-to-one-shot,\" thanks<br /><br />\nTHE DEBATE.<br />\nThe debate between Washington and Lee<br />\nand Johns Hopkins was a very successful<br />\naffair. The Hopkins speakers were Marvel,<br />\nFisher, and Harrison, while Russell acted as<br />\nalternate. Mr. Kaylor, the chairman of the<br />\nWashington and Lee Team, made a remarkably good speech and was enjoyed more by<br />\nthe audience than any other speaker. The<br />\nHopkins men won mainly upon the merit of<br />\ntheir arguments and were not quite so much<br />\nat home on their feet as their opponents.<br />\nJudge Stockbridge delivered the decision of<br />\nthe judges and all went away, satisfied that<br />\nthere had occurred a good debate. The question was, \"Resolved, That our policy be<br />\nshaped towards the abandonment of the protective tariff.\"<br /><br />\nto their defeat at Columbia's hands. They,<br />\nhowever, put up a game take, for the first few<br />\nminutes took our team and our rooters off<br />\ntheir feet. They scored two goals in short<br />\norder, but the black and blue men soon struck<br />\ntheir pace and carried the game away. It<br />\nwas a hard-fought battle from whistle to<br />\nwhistle, and kept the grandstands in a howl<br />\nall the time. Penalties were frequent, and<br />\nhardly a man on either team came out without some little souvenir to remind him he had<br />\nbeen in the game. The game was hard<br />\nfought, and again showed Hopkins ability to<br />\ncome back with more in the second period and<br />\nfinish strong. The scoreboard when the<br />\nfinal whistle blew read: Johns Hopkins, 6;<br />\nLehigh, 2.<br />\nIn the games so far played, Hopkins has<br />\nrolled up twenty-four points while our<br />\nopponents (Navy, Harvard and Lehigh)<br />\ncombined have only gotten the ball past our<br />\ngoal-keeper five times.<br /><br />\nIn patronizing our advertisers, please mention the NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n\u2014Ai<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n.0txxxxxtsgx 31<br />\n164 XX X.% le x X lrist x<br /><br />\n\u2014<br />\n4+tx:xxxxxxx*AgxxxxiczAitaticii4sigiclEx24443tx,<br />\n4.<br />\nlit1,3t!tailatilist stick 1..X11.361[Itft.liaritisrat.icititItft.X.I.30tag3,4<br /><br />\nX%<br />\nIt%<br />\n11%<br />\nx<br />\n1116<br />\natsat<br />\nI<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\niwiA4<br /><br />\nTURKISH<br />\nCIGARETTES<br /><br />\nt<br />\n4*/<br />\n4*11<br />\n4% al<br />\nCita<br />\nt XIS<br /><br />\n.)<br />\n4<br /><br />\nwon their success<br />\namong college<br />\nmen entirely on<br />\ntheir merits.<br />\nTheir sales grew<br />\nas smokers \"found<br />\nout\" how good<br />\nthey are.
