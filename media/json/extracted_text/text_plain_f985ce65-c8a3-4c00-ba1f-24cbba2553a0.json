Early in the game the<br />\nvisitors took the lead, which was<br />\nmaintained throughout; nevertheless the showing made by the Hopkins quintet was much better than<br />\nwas expected considering that the<br />\nmaterial is practically green.<br />\nThe first half started with Yarnall caging a goal from a distance,<br />\nthen a foul by Benjamin, who<br />\ncaged six fouls out of seven attempts in the entire game. Barrett' spectacular one hand shot<br />\nscored Hopkins' first point and<br />\nfront then on the visitors massed<br />\nPoint after point until at the end<br />\nof the first half the score stood<br />\n12 to 6 in their favor. It was<br />\nquite noticeable that some of the<br />\nmen had. not forgotten their football tactics for the game was<br />\nmarked by roughness, Bell Wood<br />\nand Cashell being Hopkins chief<br />\noffenders and Dieterle, Swarthmore, was forced to retire, having<br />\nfour personal fouls.<br />\nIn the second half Swarthmore<br />\nincreased her lead gradually,<br />\nmainly by short and accurate<br />\npasses, while Hopkins passed<br />\nPoorly, many of their tosses going<br />\nwild.<br />\nThe Quakers played a clever defensive game from start to finish,<br />\nbut not until the second half were<br />\nthey able to accomplish much on<br />\nthe offensive. They thrilled the<br />\nSpectators with several long shots<br />\nand their clever passing.<br />\n- Hopkins' great difficulty seemed<br />\nto be their inability to shoot from<br />\nthe foul mark, Owings, Cashell<br />\nand Bauernschmidt each taking<br />\nturns at free shots, but being able<br />\nbetween them to make only two<br />\nout of eight attempts. Owings<br />\nscored most of Hopkins' points,<br />\nmaking four field goals and one<br />\nfoul, three of the field goals being<br />\ncaged from difficult angles.<br />\nIn the preliminary game Hopkins Freshmen defeated Friends'<br />\nSchool in a close and interesting<br />\ncontest. The first half ended with<br />\nthe score of 6 to 3 in favor of<br />\nFriends, but the Freshies came<br />\nback strong in the second half and<br />\nby an excellent display of team<br />\nwork surpassed their opponents,<br />\nthe final score being 14 to 11.<br />\nThe cheering during the game<br />\nwas very poor, due mainly to the<br />\nstudent-body being scattered about<br />\nthe building.

It was originally<br />\nintended to give \"Captain Jinks<br />\nof the Horse Marines,\" one of the<br />\nbest known of the works of Clyde<br />\nFitch and the play in which Ethel<br />\nBarrymore scored such a great<br />\nsuccess a few seasons ago. It was<br />\ndeemed advisable to change plays<br />\nsimply because of the lack of Ethel<br />\nBarrymores at Hopkins. Twelve<br />\nmen, many of whom had shown<br />\nunusual skill in portraying female<br />\nroles in the past, were tried out,<br />\nbut none of these, it was thought<br />\nby Miss Walters, the coach, and<br />\nthe committee which was selecting<br />\nthe cast, could do justice to the<br />\nvery exacting \"leading lady's\"<br />\npart. Everybody who could possibly have done the part was considered, but with no success. Then<br />\nsince the play would have fallen<br />\nfiat without a splendid \"Ethel<br />\nBarryniore\" the change to the<br />\nWilde play was made.<br />\nNo one is the loser by the club's<br />\ninability to produce \"Captain<br />\nJinks.\" \"Lady Windemere's Fan\"<br />\nis one of the most famous of<br />\n<br />\nThe recent convention of athletic authorities held in Chicago<br />\nwas productive of many decisions<br />\nof great interest to Hopkins.

This event<br />\nfell to Hopkins in both meets, as<br />\nGould finished first against Stevens, with Coady second.<br />\nStevens got away to a good<br />\nstart when they took the relay, but<br />\nthe Homewood clan hung on and<br />\nfinally came out ahead when Hambleton and Gould finished first<br />\nand second, respectively, in the<br />\nplunge.<br />\nFast time was made in the Columbia tank, and the score does<br />\nnot indicate the closeness of the<br />\ncompetition. Hopkins again lost<br />\nthe relay, partly because of a bad<br />\nturn made by one man. Columbia<br />\nwon with the remarkably good<br />\ntime of 1.49% seconds. \"Davy\"<br />\nRowland was second in the 50 and<br />\n100, being nosed out by a hair's<br />\nbreadth each time.<br />\nThe 220 was a clean sweep'for<br />\nthe Black and Blue. The fast pace<br />\nwhich Coady and Gould hit up was<br />\ntoo much for Steffens of Columbia, who was half the length of<br />\nthe pool behind at the finish.<br />\nThe trip may be considered a<br />\ncomplete success, for a victory<br />\nover Stevens and a doge match<br />\nwith Columbia, one of the best<br />\nswimming squads in the East, is<br />\nan achievement to be proud of.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 4, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nFOOTBALL MANAGER FOR<br />\nELECTED.<br />\n<br />\nconsensus of opinion<br />\nat Chicago that within a few years<br />\nthe whole country will be partitioned off into separate athletic<br />\nconferences holding undisputed<br />\nsway over the leading colleges in<br />\ntheir districts.

Early in the game the<br />\nvisitors took the lead, which was<br />\nmaintained throughout; nevertheless the showing made by the Hopkins quintet was much better than<br />\nwas expected considering that the<br />\nmaterial is practically green.<br />\nThe first half started with Yarnall caging a goal from a distance,<br />\nthen a foul by Benjamin, who<br />\ncaged six fouls out of seven attempts in the entire game.

They thrilled the<br />\nSpectators with several long shots<br />\nand their clever passing.<br />\n- Hopkins' great difficulty seemed<br />\nto be their inability to shoot from<br />\nthe foul mark, Owings, Cashell<br />\nand Bauernschmidt each taking<br />\nturns at free shots, but being able<br />\nbetween them to make only two<br />\nout of eight attempts. Owings<br />\nscored most of Hopkins' points,<br />\nmaking four field goals and one<br />\nfoul, three of the field goals being<br />\ncaged from difficult angles.<br />\nIn the preliminary game Hopkins Freshmen defeated Friends'<br />\nSchool in a close and interesting<br />\ncontest. The first half ended with<br />\nthe score of 6 to 3 in favor of<br />\nFriends, but the Freshies came<br />\nback strong in the second half and<br />\nby an excellent display of team<br />\nwork surpassed their opponents,<br />\nthe final score being 14 to 11.<br />\nThe cheering during the game<br />\nwas very poor, due mainly to the<br />\nstudent-body being scattered about<br />\nthe building.

It was originally<br />\nintended to give \"Captain Jinks<br />\nof the Horse Marines,\" one of the<br />\nbest known of the works of Clyde<br />\nFitch and the play in which Ethel<br />\nBarrymore scored such a great<br />\nsuccess a few seasons ago. It was<br />\ndeemed advisable to change plays<br />\nsimply because of the lack of Ethel<br />\nBarrymores at Hopkins. Twelve<br />\nmen, many of whom had shown<br />\nunusual skill in portraying female<br />\nroles in the past, were tried out,<br />\nbut none of these, it was thought<br />\nby Miss Walters, the coach, and<br />\nthe committee which was selecting<br />\nthe cast, could do justice to the<br />\nvery exacting \"leading lady's\"<br />\npart. Everybody who could possibly have done the part was considered, but with no success. Then<br />\nsince the play would have fallen<br />\nfiat without a splendid \"Ethel<br />\nBarryniore\" the change to the<br />\nWilde play was made.<br />\nNo one is the loser by the club's<br />\ninability to produce \"Captain<br />\nJinks.\" \"Lady Windemere's Fan\"<br />\nis one of the most famous of<br /><br />\nThe recent convention of athletic authorities held in Chicago<br />\nwas productive of many decisions<br />\nof great interest to Hopkins. Dr.<br />\nRay Van Orman, who was the<br />\nHopkins representative at Chicago, comes back with word of<br />\nunusual results achieved by the<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins swimming team,<br />\nmaking a Northern trip, defeated<br />\nStevens Institute at Hoboken on<br />\nFriday night, 27 to 26, but was<br />\nforced to bow to the Columbia<br />\ntankmen, 36 to 17.<br />\nAt the New Jersey College each<br />\nsquad turned in three firsts, while<br />\nin New York, Coady, who won the<br />\n220, was the only Black and Blue<br />\nman to finish ahead. This event<br />\nfell to Hopkins in both meets, as<br />\nGould finished first against Stevens, with Coady second.<br />\nStevens got away to a good<br />\nstart when they took the relay, but<br />\nthe Homewood clan hung on and<br />\nfinally came out ahead when Hambleton and Gould finished first<br />\nand second, respectively, in the<br />\nplunge.<br />\nFast time was made in the Columbia tank, and the score does<br />\nnot indicate the closeness of the<br />\ncompetition. Hopkins again lost<br />\nthe relay, partly because of a bad<br />\nturn made by one man. Columbia<br />\nwon with the remarkably good<br />\ntime of 1.49% seconds. \"Davy\"<br />\nRowland was second in the 50 and<br />\n100, being nosed out by a hair's<br />\nbreadth each time.<br />\nThe 220 was a clean sweep'for<br />\nthe Black and Blue. The fast pace<br />\nwhich Coady and Gould hit up was<br />\ntoo much for Steffens of Columbia, who was half the length of<br />\nthe pool behind at the finish.<br />\nThe trip may be considered a<br />\ncomplete success, for a victory<br />\nover Stevens and a doge match<br />\nwith Columbia, one of the best<br />\nswimming squads in the East, is<br />\nan achievement to be proud of.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 4, col. 3)<br /><br />\nFOOTBALL MANAGER FOR<br />\nELECTED.<br /><br />\nconsensus of opinion<br />\nat Chicago that within a few years<br />\nthe whole country will be partitioned off into separate athletic<br />\nconferences holding undisputed<br />\nsway over the leading colleges in<br />\ntheir districts.
