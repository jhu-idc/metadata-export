We do the former with pleasure as we note that each year the<br />\nnumber of students grows larger.<br />\nAs to giving advice, this seems rather futile. Each student has<br />\nan experienced official 'University advisor to aid him in arranging his<br />\nschedule. Furthermore, he has innumerable unofficial advisors. For<br />\nsome unaccountable reason, the majority of upperclassmen feel it is<br />\ntheir duty to map out the schedules of the Freshmen. They fail to<br />\nconsider the fact that the preparation that the Freshman has received<br />\nprevious to entering Hopkins may be entirely different from theirs, and<br />\nthat his natural abilities probably extend along entirely different lines.<br />\nA course which may have been both easy and beneficial to one man<br />\nmay be quite difficult and useless to another. The best advice to the<br />\nfirst year man is that he accept no advice from upperclassmen as to<br />\nwhich courses he should pursue.<br />\nThe majority of Freshmen will find that they will have a considerable amount of spare time even after thoroughly preparing their<br />\nwork. We would like to make a few suggestions as to how this time<br />\nbe spent. Previous to this year fraternities made it their business to<br />\nsee that all pledges participated in some activity. This semester no first<br />\nyear man will be unduly persuaded to try out for an athletic team or<br />\na non-athletic activity.<br />\nFreshman will, however, find it to their advantage to participate<br />\nin activities. They themselves can best decide what form of activity<br />\nwill be most beneficial to them. Practically all upperclassmen will be<br />\nfound to be prejudiced. The best advice that we can give is to stick<br />\nat whatever activity is selected. Do not become discouraged.<br />\nIt is our belief that the more a man does the more he can do.<br />\nIf he finds his studies easy, he will begin to loaf. This is an art that<br />\ncan be easily mastered and the more it is attempted the more it will<br />\nbe practiced. If he maintains a full schedule till night, he will find<br />\nthat his work will be more easily completed. We sincrely hope that<br />\nthe various activities on the campus will be raised to a higher level<br />\nthrough the efforts of the class of 1934.<br />\n<br />\nTHE MAIL BAG<br />\npurpose of this publication is primarily to report the various<br />\nTHE<br />\nhappenings on this campus and to give voice to student opinion.<br />\nFor the latter we have the \"Mail Bag\" column. There are doubtless<br />\nconditions at Homewood which do not meet the approval of many<br />\nstudents. Any discussion of such problems is welcomed by the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER. In the past many reforms have first been suggested<br />\nto the students by this medium. We hope that this year will not prove<br />\nany exception for wihout reform no progress will be made.<br />\n<br />\nNIGHT FOOTBALL<br />\nIGHT football has already met with disapproval. Before it is<br />\ngiven a trial it is condemned. We search for reasons. There<br />\nseem to be only two of them. Night football is an inovation in this<br />\npart of the country, and all conservatives condemn inovations. The<br />\nsecond reason is that a \"fast one has been pulled.\" We leave school<br />\nin June. When we return, equipment for nocturnal games has been<br />\ninstalled. The students have no chance to voice an opinion. We<br />\nwould suggest that criticism be withheld until night football has had<br />\na fair trial.<br />\n<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\nThis is your first year at college<br />\n<br />\n7 DINNERS<br />\n<br />\nwords of welcome. \"In a sense,\"<br />\n<br />\nFOUNDED 1897<br />\nSubscription<br />\n<br />\nhe said, \"we are both Freshmen.<br />\n<br />\nCollege Men Will Appreciate This<br />\n6 BREAKFASTS<br />\n$7.00<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from page 1, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nLIBRARY IMPROVEMENTS<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter:<br />\nStudents returning to the University from their summer vacations will notice changes in the main<br />\nreading room in Gilman Hall.

The books will<br />\nnecessarily be few, since they are<br />\nto be secured by other means than<br />\nby purchase with the regular book<br />\nfund o fthe Library. The Librarian hereby confesses his willingness to accept contributions of<br />\nmoney for the purchase of additions<br />\nto the collection. The most important point, however, is this\u2014that<br />\nthese books should not be taken<br />\naway from the bay and the tables<br />\nshould not be used for studying<br />\ntext books and writing themes, but<br />\nshould be reserved for the casual<br />\nreader. It is the hope of the Library staff that students will help<br />\nto establish this practice as a tradition.<br />\nNew students, who see the King<br />\nWindows for the first time, may<br />\nsecure a sheet of description of the<br />\nprinters' marks used in the decorations by applying at the desk. They<br />\nare quite welcome to bring their<br />\nfriends to see the room.

We do the former with pleasure as we note that each year the<br />\nnumber of students grows larger.<br />\nAs to giving advice, this seems rather futile. Each student has<br />\nan experienced official 'University advisor to aid him in arranging his<br />\nschedule. Furthermore, he has innumerable unofficial advisors. For<br />\nsome unaccountable reason, the majority of upperclassmen feel it is<br />\ntheir duty to map out the schedules of the Freshmen. They fail to<br />\nconsider the fact that the preparation that the Freshman has received<br />\nprevious to entering Hopkins may be entirely different from theirs, and<br />\nthat his natural abilities probably extend along entirely different lines.<br />\nA course which may have been both easy and beneficial to one man<br />\nmay be quite difficult and useless to another. The best advice to the<br />\nfirst year man is that he accept no advice from upperclassmen as to<br />\nwhich courses he should pursue.<br />\nThe majority of Freshmen will find that they will have a considerable amount of spare time even after thoroughly preparing their<br />\nwork. We would like to make a few suggestions as to how this time<br />\nbe spent. Previous to this year fraternities made it their business to<br />\nsee that all pledges participated in some activity. This semester no first<br />\nyear man will be unduly persuaded to try out for an athletic team or<br />\na non-athletic activity.<br />\nFreshman will, however, find it to their advantage to participate<br />\nin activities. They themselves can best decide what form of activity<br />\nwill be most beneficial to them. Practically all upperclassmen will be<br />\nfound to be prejudiced. The best advice that we can give is to stick<br />\nat whatever activity is selected. Do not become discouraged.<br />\nIt is our belief that the more a man does the more he can do.<br />\nIf he finds his studies easy, he will begin to loaf. This is an art that<br />\ncan be easily mastered and the more it is attempted the more it will<br />\nbe practiced. If he maintains a full schedule till night, he will find<br />\nthat his work will be more easily completed. We sincrely hope that<br />\nthe various activities on the campus will be raised to a higher level<br />\nthrough the efforts of the class of 1934.<br /><br />\nTHE MAIL BAG<br />\npurpose of this publication is primarily to report the various<br />\nTHE<br />\nhappenings on this campus and to give voice to student opinion.<br />\nFor the latter we have the \"Mail Bag\" column. There are doubtless<br />\nconditions at Homewood which do not meet the approval of many<br />\nstudents. Any discussion of such problems is welcomed by the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER. In the past many reforms have first been suggested<br />\nto the students by this medium. We hope that this year will not prove<br />\nany exception for wihout reform no progress will be made.<br /><br />\nNIGHT FOOTBALL<br />\nIGHT football has already met with disapproval. Before it is<br />\ngiven a trial it is condemned. We search for reasons. There<br />\nseem to be only two of them. Night football is an inovation in this<br />\npart of the country, and all conservatives condemn inovations. The<br />\nsecond reason is that a \"fast one has been pulled.\" We leave school<br />\nin June. When we return, equipment for nocturnal games has been<br />\ninstalled. The students have no chance to voice an opinion. We<br />\nwould suggest that criticism be withheld until night football has had<br />\na fair trial.<br /><br />\nN<br /><br />\nThis is your first year at college<br /><br />\n7 DINNERS<br /><br />\nwords of welcome. \"In a sense,\"<br /><br />\nFOUNDED 1897<br />\nSubscription<br /><br />\nhe said, \"we are both Freshmen.<br /><br />\nCollege Men Will Appreciate This<br />\n6 BREAKFASTS<br />\n$7.00<br /><br />\n(Continued from page 1, col. 2)<br /><br />\nLIBRARY IMPROVEMENTS<br />\nTo the Editor of the News-Letter:<br />\nStudents returning to the University from their summer vacations will notice changes in the main<br />\nreading room in Gilman Hall. The<br />\nimprovements in that room, begun<br />\nby the installation of the King Memorial Windows,are now complete;<br />\nand members of the University<br />\nwhose work does not ordinarily<br />\nbring them into Gilman Hall are<br />\ncordially invited to come and see<br />\nwhat has been done.<br />\nThe new furnishings of the bay<br />\nare the gift of an alumnus, a good<br />\nfriend and classmate of the Librarian, Mr. W. L. Ross, of New<br />\nYork City, who generously provided the means of making the furniture fit the beautiful windows. It<br />\nis the purpose of his gift to make<br />\nthat part of the room so attractive<br />\nthat both students and faculty will<br />\nbe tempted to linger in it for casual<br />\nreading not required by study or research.<br />\nTo heighten the temptation it is<br />\nproposed to have a few good books<br />\non the tables, gathered into what<br />\nis to be known as a Leisure Reading Collection. The books will<br />\nnecessarily be few, since they are<br />\nto be secured by other means than<br />\nby purchase with the regular book<br />\nfund o fthe Library. The Librarian hereby confesses his willingness to accept contributions of<br />\nmoney for the purchase of additions<br />\nto the collection. The most important point, however, is this\u2014that<br />\nthese books should not be taken<br />\naway from the bay and the tables<br />\nshould not be used for studying<br />\ntext books and writing themes, but<br />\nshould be reserved for the casual<br />\nreader. It is the hope of the Library staff that students will help<br />\nto establish this practice as a tradition.<br />\nNew students, who see the King<br />\nWindows for the first time, may<br />\nsecure a sheet of description of the<br />\nprinters' marks used in the decorations by applying at the desk. They<br />\nare quite welcome to bring their<br />\nfriends to see the room. It has been<br />\nsaid by some of our visitors to be<br />\none of the most attractive college<br />\nreading rooms in the country, and<br />\nwe are glad to have friends of the<br />\nUniversity inspect it.<br /><br />\nHASSLINGER'S<br />\n3226 Greenmount Avenue<br />\nJust Below 33rd Street<br /><br />\nAT<br /><br />\nTHE BALTIMORE AIRPORT,Inc.<br />\nRUTHERFORD FIELD<br />\n1 MILE WEST OF WOODLAWN<br />\n9-12 P.

It is proposed that the<br />\nforthcoming number will discontinue the literary policy followed<br />\nmore or less successfully during<br />\nthe last two years. The intended<br />\nchange will have as its aim the publication of a magazine that is purely<br />\nhumorous. This is a revision of<br />\nthe type of magazine that was edited<br />\nbefore Ben Kolb inaugurated his<br />\nidea of a periodical; that is, a combination of humor and literature.<br />\nThe keynote will be a ton of humor<br />\nand an ounce of seriousness.<br />\nAmong other changes, \"Seen<br />\nfrom the Pit,\" which has been a<br />\npart of the magazine, has been deleted and will be replaced by<br />\n\"Around the Campus,\" which has<br />\nbeen expanded to two pages.<br />\nThe cover will also be changed.<br />\nFormerly the design was one by<br />\nBen Kolb, editor o fthe Jay in 1929;<br />\nthis year, however, a \u2022new idea\u2014<br />\nmore in the spirit of the first issue\u2014<br />\nA Freshman number\u2014will be used.<br />\nThere are going to be several<br />\narticles by noted writers. Several<br />\nof the prominent members of the<br />\nfaculty have consented to write features for the magazine.<br />\nNot only has the policy of the<br />\nmagazine been changed, but even<br />\nthe office. A new bulletin board,<br />\nwhich will inform the staff of all<br />\nparticulars, has been erected.<br />\nIt is expected by Harold Bloom,<br />\nthe editor-in-chief, and Wilson<br />\nRutherford, the business manager<br />\nthat the Blue Jay will be bigger and<br />\nbetter than ever.<br />\nCompetition for offices on the<br />\nbusiness and editorial staff will begin on Friday.
