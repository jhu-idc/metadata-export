BOARD<br />\nAn apparently time-worn tradition at Hopkins is the system<br />\nof electing members of the A. A. Board, according to classes,<br />\nby the entire student body. Although athletes are usually the<br />\nmen to be chosen, anyone at all may be nominated, and subsequently elected. Moreover, inexperienced men are sure to be<br />\nelected from the lower classes, regardless of whether they are<br />\nathletes or not. The make-up of the Board, it seems to us, is<br />\nhighly illogical.<br />\nInstead of electing the Athletic Board early in May, we suggest<br />\nthat membership be entirely automatic and that it be taken out of<br />\nthe hands of the student body. It would be much more desirable<br />\nfrom many standpoints to have the Board made up of all the<br />\ncaptains and managers of varsity sports, with the possible addition<br />\nof two or three senior members of varsity teams. These two or<br />\nthree members-at-large could be elected by the student body at the<br />\nsame time that the president of the student council is elected, or<br />\ncould be elected by the men who have won their letter in varsity<br />\nsports.<br />\nAn inspection of the personnel of the 1927-28 Board will show<br />\nthat the following men do not hold membership: The captains<br />\nof track, cross country, and swimming; the managers of lacrosse,<br />\ntrack and swimming. The track and swimming teams have no<br />\nrepresentation on the Board whatsoever.<br />\nInasmuch as the captains and managers are the men chosen by<br />\nthe teams to lead them through the athletic season, these same<br />\nmen should be the ones to direct the administrative policy of<br />\nUniversity athletics. It seems ludicrous that three captains and<br />\nthree managers should be excluded from the Board when men<br />\nwho have never won the H are members.<br />\nThe election of three members-at-large from the senior class<br />\nwould allow experienced men to help in the administration of<br />\nathletics even though they might not be captains of teams.<br />\nThe present system is entirely anomalous. Even though the<br />\ncaptains of track and lacrosse should be eligibile for election to the<br />\nA. A. Board, the Board election precedes the captaincy elections,<br />\nmaking it impossible to know who the captains will be until after<br />\nit is too late.<br />\nWe suggest that this plan be submitted to the student body as<br />\nsoon as possible and that the 1928-29 Board be elected under the<br />\nnew system.<br />\n<br />\nThis St. John's College may quite possibly supplant the extinct<br />\nJohns Hopkins as the beloved and honored institution of Maryland. Undoubtedly, when student activities here are reduced to<br />\nstamp-collecting and chess, as they soon will be, men who ten<br />\nyears ago might have upheld the honor of J. H. U. will be adding<br />\nglory to the name of St. John's. There may even be fraternities<br />\nin Annapolis.<br />\nAs for the town itself, its appeal is attested by the recent migrations of our own freshmen and sophomore classes. Last year<br />\nthese men, regretting their choice of an Alma Mater, could not<br />\nforbear an envious look at what might have been; so boisterous<br />\nwas their enthusiasm, that quiet old Annapolis was moved to<br />\nalarm rather than to welcome. The Hopkins freshman class<br />\nof this year differ from their predecessors only in that they went<br />\nto Annapolis in time to get into St. John's.<br />\nIt is a vivid contrast\u2014this contrast of two universities, one<br />\nvigorous in its youth, the other lethargic and intensely dignified<br />\nin a premature middle-age; one sacrificing fine fraternity prospects for spectacled students oozing crude oil, the other offering<br />\nits poor but noble best and winning all of Baltimore's upright,<br />\nsplendid young American manhood; one clinging to a remnant<br />\nof athletic prestige only through the valiant obstinacy of a lacrosse<br />\nteam, the other building\u2014building from the very bottom, a name<br />\nin athletic circles. It is a tragic contrast.<br />\nPerhaps there is no scandal. Perhaps it is an accident. * *<br />\nSt. John's is getting rich.<br />\nRespectfully yours,<br />\nG.

The<br />\nodds ranged from 3 and 4 to 1 that<br />\nsome one died, but when three<br />\nyouths from the surveying department appeared on the scene with<br />\nfull paraphernalia and beaming<br />\nfaces the odds dropped to even<br />\nmoney that it was a pogo stick.<br />\nFinally after many mysterious<br />\nmaneuvers, the surveyors opened<br />\nthe box and started putting up little<br />\nbox-shaped wires and pretty multicolored stakes.<br />\nNow it dawned on their bored<br />\nbrains. The good Mrs. Vanneman<br />\nhad bought her boys a croquet set<br />\nto help pass the long, dull autumn<br />\nafternoons.<br />\nBut what is all the noise and excitement around the dorms?

This will be the third year<br />\nthat Warfield has served on the<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nBecause of the large number of<br />\nnominees for the various offices in<br />\nthe freshman class, no man received<br />\na majority of the votes cast. According to the constitution unanimously adopted by the class at its<br />\nfirst meeting, one must receive a<br />\nmajority of the number of votes cast<br />\nto be elected. In case no man does<br />\nreceive a majority, those two having<br />\nthe highest number of votes shall<br />\nagain be balloted upon.

During the second half of<br />\nthe game with the Orange team the<br />\nball was continually in their territory and the Black and Blue team<br />\nhad five chances to score, of which<br />\none was seized upon by the alert<br />\nHouston, who was _substituted for<br />\nCaptain 1Vialtonee after the latter<br />\nhad injured his arm.<br />\nQuakers Make Good Showing<br /><br />\nFrom the showing the Haverford<br />\nteam made against the powerful aggregation of Amherst last Saturday,<br />\nthe game tomorrow should be a stiff<br />\none for Hopkins.

In<br />\nthe game against Amherst Morris<br />\nand Ensworth were towers of<br />\nstrength on the defense; Morris at<br />\nright tackle proved a stumblingblock to many of the Amherst line<br />\nplays, while Ensworth, who was a<br />\nsubstitute back last year, did very<br />\nbrilliant work in backing up the<br />\nline.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, OCTOBER 14, 1927<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins News-Letter<br /><br />\nYES AND NO<br /><br />\nFOUNDED 1897<br /><br />\nTo the Yes and No Column\u2014<br />\nI am on the trail of scandal; . . .

BOARD<br />\nAn apparently time-worn tradition at Hopkins is the system<br />\nof electing members of the A. A. Board, according to classes,<br />\nby the entire student body. Although athletes are usually the<br />\nmen to be chosen, anyone at all may be nominated, and subsequently elected. Moreover, inexperienced men are sure to be<br />\nelected from the lower classes, regardless of whether they are<br />\nathletes or not. The make-up of the Board, it seems to us, is<br />\nhighly illogical.<br />\nInstead of electing the Athletic Board early in May, we suggest<br />\nthat membership be entirely automatic and that it be taken out of<br />\nthe hands of the student body. It would be much more desirable<br />\nfrom many standpoints to have the Board made up of all the<br />\ncaptains and managers of varsity sports, with the possible addition<br />\nof two or three senior members of varsity teams. These two or<br />\nthree members-at-large could be elected by the student body at the<br />\nsame time that the president of the student council is elected, or<br />\ncould be elected by the men who have won their letter in varsity<br />\nsports.<br />\nAn inspection of the personnel of the 1927-28 Board will show<br />\nthat the following men do not hold membership: The captains<br />\nof track, cross country, and swimming; the managers of lacrosse,<br />\ntrack and swimming. The track and swimming teams have no<br />\nrepresentation on the Board whatsoever.<br />\nInasmuch as the captains and managers are the men chosen by<br />\nthe teams to lead them through the athletic season, these same<br />\nmen should be the ones to direct the administrative policy of<br />\nUniversity athletics. It seems ludicrous that three captains and<br />\nthree managers should be excluded from the Board when men<br />\nwho have never won the H are members.<br />\nThe election of three members-at-large from the senior class<br />\nwould allow experienced men to help in the administration of<br />\nathletics even though they might not be captains of teams.<br />\nThe present system is entirely anomalous. Even though the<br />\ncaptains of track and lacrosse should be eligibile for election to the<br />\nA. A. Board, the Board election precedes the captaincy elections,<br />\nmaking it impossible to know who the captains will be until after<br />\nit is too late.<br />\nWe suggest that this plan be submitted to the student body as<br />\nsoon as possible and that the 1928-29 Board be elected under the<br />\nnew system.<br /><br />\nThis St. John's College may quite possibly supplant the extinct<br />\nJohns Hopkins as the beloved and honored institution of Maryland. Undoubtedly, when student activities here are reduced to<br />\nstamp-collecting and chess, as they soon will be, men who ten<br />\nyears ago might have upheld the honor of J. H. U. will be adding<br />\nglory to the name of St. John's. There may even be fraternities<br />\nin Annapolis.<br />\nAs for the town itself, its appeal is attested by the recent migrations of our own freshmen and sophomore classes. Last year<br />\nthese men, regretting their choice of an Alma Mater, could not<br />\nforbear an envious look at what might have been; so boisterous<br />\nwas their enthusiasm, that quiet old Annapolis was moved to<br />\nalarm rather than to welcome. The Hopkins freshman class<br />\nof this year differ from their predecessors only in that they went<br />\nto Annapolis in time to get into St. John's.<br />\nIt is a vivid contrast\u2014this contrast of two universities, one<br />\nvigorous in its youth, the other lethargic and intensely dignified<br />\nin a premature middle-age; one sacrificing fine fraternity prospects for spectacled students oozing crude oil, the other offering<br />\nits poor but noble best and winning all of Baltimore's upright,<br />\nsplendid young American manhood; one clinging to a remnant<br />\nof athletic prestige only through the valiant obstinacy of a lacrosse<br />\nteam, the other building\u2014building from the very bottom, a name<br />\nin athletic circles. It is a tragic contrast.<br />\nPerhaps there is no scandal. Perhaps it is an accident. * *<br />\nSt. John's is getting rich.<br />\nRespectfully yours,<br />\nG.
