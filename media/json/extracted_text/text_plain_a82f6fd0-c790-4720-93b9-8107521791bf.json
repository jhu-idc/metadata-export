This maxim seems especially pertinent after reading recent reports by President William Richardson<br />\nand Ombudsman Sigmund Suskind. Both documents suggest, in their<br />\nown way, that, as much as ever, it is the undergraduates at Hopkins<br />\nwho are being left out.<br />\nRichardson's thoughts surfaced in an address to the Board of<br />\nTrustees, which accounts for their focus on financial and technical<br />\nissues. That disclaimer aside, it should be noted that the new president is already growing adept at a familiar administrative song-anddance. The song hints at great things for Hopkins undergraduates<br />\nin the near future\u2014smaller class sizes, a more diverse student population, closer contact with professors, the works. But the dance conveniently avoids specifics: What? When'? For how many and how<br />\nmuch? Many at Homewood were more than willing to grant Richardson a chance to prove his commitment to undergraduates. But on<br />\nthe eveidence of his remarks\u2014and remarks and remarks\u2014the president is fast joining the ranks of the noncommittal. His October 15<br />\nspeech to the trustees includes only two substantial mentions of<br />\nundergraduates: an admission of the \"need to focus on the quality<br />\nof undergraduate education\" and a nebulous reference to a Freshman<br />\nSeminar program.<br />\nThe News-Letter doesn't aim to sound the alarm or call Richardson a fraud. But upon examining the text of his speech, which was<br />\nprinted in the October 29 edition of the Gazette, we find sufficient<br />\nevidence to make us uneasy. Not only does the president marginalize<br />\nundergraduates to the point of inaudability\u2014he gives no indication<br />\nof their widespread dissatisfaction\u2014but he plunges head-first into the<br />\nJohns Hopkins \"international reputation\" rhetoric that was supposedly<br />\na thing of the past. In the closing sentences of his speech, Richardson announces confidently that \"Johns Hopkins will increasingly be<br />\nseen. . . as a leading international research university\u2014one of a very<br />\nsmall number of American universities, perhaps no greater than five<br />\nor six in number, whose names are immediately recognizable<br />\nanywhere in the world.\"<br />\nBut what good is brand-name recognition if the quality of the<br />\nproduct\u2014or at least its undergraduate item\u2014seems locked in a cycle<br />\nof decline? More to the point, how can we ensure quality-control<br />\nin our education? When the Office of the Ombudsman was created<br />\nin July 1988, it seemed at least one potential conduit for undergraduate<br />\ncomplaints about the University. To be fair, it may still be a legitimate<br />\nchannel, though on the evidence of the Second Annual Report of the<br />\nOffice of the Ombudsman (also published in Monday's Gazette), one<br />\ngets the idea that Sigmund Suskind also spends a good deal of his<br />\n<br />\ntime performing.<br />\nIt's not that Suskind and his office intend to be specious; they were<br />\nborn that way. As the report states, the Ombudsman's office \"is not<br />\npart of the formal structure of the University.\" And it was never<br />\nmeant to be, at former president Steven Muller's behest. Doesn't<br />\nthat mean that the Office can be objective about controversial issues?<br />\nYes, but unfortunately, that precious anonymity also leaves the Ombudsman without substantial authority. Suskind refers to his office<br />\nas a \"designated neutral,\" and it's an apt term. Impartial but ineffective, the Office of the Ombudsman sounds great on paper. But<br />\nas a tool for effecting concrete changes, it leaves nearly everything<br />\nto be desired.<br />\nAll of this however, should not be a signal to undergraduates to<br />\ngrin and pay it. There's plenty that one can do to voice his or her<br />\nopinion to the administration. Direct correspondence with administrators is a tried and effective method. Better still is to have<br />\nyour parents mail in their complaints; that will get some attention.<br />\nDemonstrations and petitions\u2014these things do surface at places other<br />\nthan Berkeley\u2014are often tremendously succesful at gaining the attention of the powers in Garland.<br />\nAction is essential. When Richardson first came to Hopkins, he<br />\nseemed cautious and spoke earnestly of a commitment to<br />\nundergraduates. The implication was that he was here to help us.<br />\nWell, The Johns Hopkins University is a gargantuan institution\u2014<br />\nthe government will likely allocate $650 million to it in fiscal<br />\n1991\u2014and it often takes loud, consistent complaining to be heard<br />\nover the din of such impressive figures. Richardson seems increasingly preoccupied with developments abroad. We should take steps<br />\nto make sure he doesn't forget about us.<br />\nBeyond those mentioned above, the News-Letter, not surprisingly, is attached to the idea of spreading \"the bad word\" via the printed<br />\nword. There are several publications at Hopkins\u2014The Spectator,<br />\nPerspectives, and the fledgling PSU newspaper come immediately<br />\nto mind\u2014that could work with us toward this end. It's no mystery<br />\nthat Hopkins is riddled with problems. What is puzzling is why the<br />\nundergraduate population is so quiet about them.<br />\nIt's time to speak up before the new regime learns to ignore us.<br />\nas skillfully as the old one did. Find a mouthpiece\u2014a letter to the<br />\nEditor of a campus publication, a meeting with the dean of your<br />\nchoice, or perhaps something more visually arresting\u2014and state your<br />\ncase. Get fellow students involved. You don't have to assume that<br />\nall is wrong in the Hopkins world, or that the administration is ignorant until proven guilty. Just watch, listen, and make yourselves<br />\nheard.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nDouglass Barre<br />\n<br />\nEpisode Seven:<br />\nMorning Is Broken<br />\nMiranda's alarm clock didn't<br />\nring. That isn't to say that it<br />\ndidn't go off, but it certainly<br />\ndidn't ring. It tried to wake<br />\nMiranda by emitting a<br />\nmonotonous series of altogether<br />\ntoo soft beeps, which, of course,<br />\nconsistently failed to rouse her<br />\nfrom her blissful rest.<br />\nAt seven-oh-nine on Friday<br />\nmorning, Miranda's alarm clock<br />\nbeeped. In an unconscious stupor,<br />\nher left arm swung around and<br />\ntapped the device into \"snooze<br />\nmode,\" the electronic equivalent<br />\nof \"Right: You're tired, I'll come<br />\nback in nine minutes and hopefully you won't hit me again.\" With<br />\nthat, Miranda returned to her<br />\ndream of Daniel Day-Lewis and<br />\nChristian Slater doing long division in their heads, naked.<br />\nNine minutes later, the clock<br />\ngave it another try. This time,<br />\nMiranda's eyes bolted open and<br />\nshe realized that not only wasn't<br />\nshe watching Dan and Christian's<br />\nmath composition, but she wasn't<br />\neven in her own bed in California. She was still in hell. The east<br />\ncoast. School.<br />\nShe kicked down the covers,<br />\nwrap:)ed her fuzzy green<br />\nbathrobe around her, and headed for the kitchen. Zack was inthe living room, asleep on the<br />\ncouch. Miranda occasionally<br />\nwondered if Zack was telling the<br />\ntruth when he said that he had his<br />\nown apartment. It wasn't like he<br />\never spent any time there. He had<br />\nslept through last night's house<br />\nmeeting debacle, somehow, and<br />\nhe didn't show any sign of<br />\nrecovering from that state.<br />\nShe poked him with her finger.<br />\nHe mumbled \"don't forget to<br />\nwater the armadillo, honey,\" and<br />\nplunged his head into the couch<br />\npillow. Deeper than it already<br />\nwas, at least.<br />\nDoris was already in the kitchen, a fact made abominably<br />\nclear by her perky cry of \"Good<br />\nmorning, Miranda! Want some<br />\n<br />\noatmeal?\" Miranda did not.<br />\nMiranda didn't want happiness<br />\nand cheer, either, though that she<br />\ndidn't think she could escape.<br />\nDoris had most likely gotten up<br />\nat around five to take a walk and<br />\nfinish some political paper left<br />\nover from last night. As she did<br />\nevery morning. Miranda filled a<br />\n<br />\nZack mumbled,\"Don't<br />\nforget to water the<br />\narmadillo, honey.\"<br />\n<br />\ncup with water to make some tea.<br />\nWhen she opened the microwave,<br />\nhowever, there was alreay a cup<br />\nof water there.<br />\n\"Doris?\" Miranda sighed.<br />\n\"Oops, sorry!\" Doris smiled.<br />\n\"1 forgot to take it out. I'll reheat<br />\nit, it'll only take a sec!\" Doris<br />\nslammed the microwave door and<br />\nset it for two minutes. Doris also<br />\ndid this every morning, unfortunately for Miranda. Miranda<br />\nwas certain that Doris carried<br />\nsome sort of leave-your-water-inthe-microwave gene, as no matter how many times Miranda tried<br />\nto give Doris a clue (including the<br />\ntime she poured water on Doris'<br />\nhead in a fit of pique) Doris happily continued on, unenlightened.<br />\nMiranda hoped it was recessive.<br />\nShe trudged back towards her<br />\nroom, checking to make sure that<br />\nZack hadn't drowned in the<br />\ncouch. He hadn't. Unfortunately, that left Miranda the inevitable<br />\ntask of trying to wake him up.<br />\nEven Carol didn't have the will<br />\nto do it when she was going out<br />\nwith him. She had just left him<br />\nin bed for Miranda to awaken<br />\nwith her loud toothbrushing.<br />\nMiranda crossed herself. It was<br />\nthat time, and she needed all the<br />\nhelp she could get to deal with the<br />\nlate sleeping slug. Zack and she<br />\nContinued on page /6<br />\n<br />\nPetitioning for the Status Quo; Three Evils: Loud<br />\nMusic, Construction Noise, and the News-Letter; Others<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing to promote the College Republicans' petition to allow<br />\nROTC to remain on campus in its<br />\npresent form.

Is it worth denying a student<br />\na chance to attend Hopkins via a<br />\nROTC scholarship in order to make<br />\na statement against the defense<br />\ndepartment?<br />\nThe petition is silent on the question of whether the armed forces'<br />\npolicy excluding homosexuals is<br />\njust. Personally, I cannot pretend to<br />\nknow enough about military life to<br />\nmake a definitive statement. The<br />\noverriding concern is the preservation of an integral part of Hopkins.<br />\nI believe the vast majority of students<br />\non campus agree.<br />\nThe ROTC issue should not be<br />\ndecided by student opinion, and this<br />\nis one of the reasons we originally<br />\nhesitated on starting up a petition.<br />\nThere have been signals, however,<br />\nthat student opinion will be taken into account. GALA has realized this<br />\nand repeatedly written into this<br />\npaper. Up until now, this may have<br />\ngiven the trustees the idea that student opinion strongly supports the<br />\nremoval of ROTC from campus.<br />\nThis myth is over, and I challenge<br />\nanyone who thinks ROTC should be<br />\nsent packing to start a petition along<br />\nthose lines.<br />\nDaniel Abrams<br />\nPresident\u2014College Republicans<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a resident of McCoy Hall, I<br />\nfeel obligated to respond to your<br />\neditorial of October 26th on the<br />\nstatus of the Grad Club. I must object to the News-Letter's practice of<br />\nwriting an editorial condemning<br />\nMcCoy residents for being selfish<br />\nPuritans opposed to a little loud<br />\nmusic from the Grad Club, when<br />\nthere was no attempt to gather facts<br />\nand present them in a corresponding<br />\narticle. Standard journalistic procedure calls tor an objective news<br />\naccount of a situation to accompany<br />\nan official editorial position. At no<br />\npoint did the News-Letter contact any<br />\n<br />\nMcCoy resident and attempt to obtain a full account of the situation.<br />\nInstead, the so-called facts were based solely on information supplied by<br />\nthe Grad Club managers.<br />\nUndoubtedly, the Grad Club plays<br />\nan important role on a campus where<br />\noutlets for live music are few and far<br />\nbetween. What needs to be said,<br />\nhowever, is that those McCoy<br />\nresidents most affected by Grad Club<br />\nnoise are also those located next to<br />\nthe construction noise of Wolman<br />\nHall. The News-Letter tells us we<br />\nshould cope with loud music until<br />\none a.m., but ignores the realities of<br />\ndeafening construction noise, often<br />\nbeginnng at 6 a.m. While the new<br />\nWolman will certainly be a welcome<br />\naddition, the effect of Wolman construction on the residents of McCoy<br />\nand other nearby buildings is<br />\nperhaps the most ignored story of the<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe News-Letter is correct in that<br />\ndecisions about the Grad Club, or for<br />\nthat matter any other program that<br />\naffects students, should not be made<br />\narbitrarily and without student input.<br />\nBlaming the residents of McCoy for<br />\nthe University's failure to provide<br />\nadequate programming space on<br />\ncampus is counter-productive. Instead of playing into a divide-andconquer strategy, the News-Letter<br />\nand concerned students should be<br />\nasking themselves some harder questions, such as why Ivy Hall, the<br />\nUniversity-owned property on 33rd<br />\nStreet, remains empty and unused.<br />\nPerhaps if the News-Letter took news<br />\na little more seriously, we would all<br />\nbe a little better off.<br />\nJonathan Roberts<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would just like to respond to<br />\nKevin McCrea's \"Right Angle\" in<br />\n<br />\nthe October 26th issue of the News- anti-civilization Bolshevist conLetter.

It<br />\ncontains information culled largely from the Undergraduate<br />\nAcademic Manual, with some<br />\ndetailing<br />\nmaterial<br />\nnew<br />\npunishments for misconduct.<br />\nTypically it contains half-answers<br />\nwhile trying to abridge the rights<br />\nof students.<br />\nWhat is disturbing about the<br />\ndocument is its totalitarian tone.<br />\nIt opens with a statement of Expectations that informs readers<br />\nthat students who are \"a danger<br />\nto their own personal safety. .. will be disciplined.\" According to the administration, acts<br />\nrequiring discipline are things<br />\n\"which have the potential of harming others.\" These stipulations<br />\nare so broadly drawn that they<br />\ncould encompass anything from<br />\njuggling with knives to driving<br />\n<br />\n(an automobile is a weapon, you<br />\nknow).<br />\nThe \"Sanctions\" section, comprising material heretofore uncodified, demonstrates the unforgiving feel of the mailing. The<br />\nword \"sanction\" itself is a legal<br />\nterm that connotes penalties for<br />\ndisobedience. The mildest of the<br />\nsanctions, \"probation,\" also has<br />\na jurisprudential sense; it brings<br />\nto mind a regular program of<br />\ncheck-ups by the local Keystone<br />\nCops. Interestingly, a second offense while on probation will lead<br />\nto suspension or expulsion, the<br />\nfinal two prescribed punishments.<br />\n(There are no gradations at<br />\nHopkins.)<br />\nOnce again the University is<br />\nusing its powers of discrimination<br />\nin disregard to students living in<br />\nHopkins-owned housing.

This expulsion could then jeopardize the<br />\nstudent's chance of continuing in<br />\nschool. What good does it serve<br />\nto put that student's future at risk<br />\nif someone else who lives in a<br />\nrowhouse would get off much<br />\neasier for the same crime?<br />\n<br />\nBradley Cohen<br />\n<br />\nTwo students trek<br />\nto Florida in search<br />\nof former provost<br />\nJohn Lombardi\u2014with<br />\ninteresting results<br />\n<br />\nabout last year's. If you missed<br />\nit, you missed one of the classic<br />\ndebates in history. No, I am not<br />\ntalking about Lincoln vs.<br />\nDouglas; nor about Kennedy vs.<br />\nNixon; I am talking about Dr.<br />\nLombardi vs. Charles Sykes.<br />\nIn that debate, Dr. Lombardi<br />\nmade rhetorical history when he<br />\ncountered Mr. Sykes' argument<br />\nthat American universities were<br />\nfailing in their mission towards<br />\nundergraduates by comparing the<br />\nAmerican higher education<br />\nsystem to a taco.<br />\nIn a rhetorical construct that<br />\nleft the crowd trembling, Dr.<br />\nLombardi argued that Mr. Sykes'<br />\narguments failed because they<br />\ntried to group together schools<br />\nwith different resources and different goals. American higher<br />\neducation, he said, is like a taco<br />\nbecause it comprises different<br />\n\"stuff\" that is hard to examine<br />\nand work with.<br />\nThe debate left an impression<br />\nin my mind of Dr. Lombardi as<br />\nan administrator a bit out of touch<br />\nwith reality.

The<br />\nwhole Statement of Expectations<br />\nis indistinct. One of the misdeeds<br />\nleading to forfeiture of student<br />\nstatus is \"behavior which tends<br />\nto impair the University's purpose or its reputation.\" The<br />\nUniversity's purpose, to all<br />\nobservers, has nothing to do with<br />\nundergraduates, and everything<br />\nto do with money. Most students<br />\nare not in a position (but in opposition) to slow the flow of<br />\ndollars Hopkins coffers. Closing<br />\nthe much-ballyhooed radio station, or racking up a large deficit<br />\ntend to impair the University's<br />\nreputation more than any student<br />\never could.<br />\nThe use of \"tends\" is a<br />\nstrategic choice. As an indefinite<br />\nverb, it weakens the specificity<br />\nthat \"impairing\" alone would<br />\nlend to the rule. As expectations<br />\nare now, almost anything could<br />\n\"tend to impair\" the much inflated Hopkins reputation\u2014even<br />\nthe truth. By structuring the rules<br />\nin a nebulous manner, with<br />\nlanguage that invites mutable interpretation, the University has<br />\ncreated circumstances where<br />\nplain statements of detracting<br />\nfact, let alone whistle-blowing,<br />\nwould be punishable.<br />\nThe sudden appearance of these<br />\nexpanded regulations begs a question. Why? Did something occur<br />\nrecently that caught the administration off guard? If the information in this handout is<br />\navailable in the Academic Manual<br />\ngiven to all undergraduates, why<br />\nre-release it now? This mass<br />\nmailing wasn't expensive (less<br />\n<br />\nthan $300 by crude calculations)<br />\nbut was it necessary? A far more<br />\negregious example of gross excess is the glossy guide to Maintaining A Drug-Free Environment, from the Substance Abuse<br />\nProgram. Where is discretion in<br />\nthese times of austerity?<br />\nThe fact that this warning sheet<br />\nexists at all (the title is almost<br />\nself-deprecating) brings up the<br />\nissues of morality and ethics in<br />\ngeneral.

But the lack<br />\nof a formalized code is not<br />\nbecause Hopkins students are so<br />\nfar above it. To the contrary, the<br />\nvery frequency of infractions<br />\nmade it untenable. An ethics<br />\nboard exists to investigate complaints, but it is only a reactive<br />\nbody. Freshmen and new students<br />\nare not formally introduced to or<br />\nasked to sign an honor code, even<br />\nof their own volition.

The Grad Club<br />\nis intended to provide a resource<br />\nto graduate students by providing<br />\na relaxed atmosphere for studying, meeting or hanging out. Additionally, special events of interest for all students are planned for the Grad Club.

I'm<br />\nquite sure that, in Meredith's<br />\nmind, he sees a Ted Kennedy<br />\nmaliciously savoring the poor<br />\ncampus, the GRO funds most of<br />\nthe entertainment which occurs in<br />\nthe Grad Club. The cover charge<br />\nis the only revenue which the<br />\nGRO receives from the Grad<br />\nClub. this amount is always much<br />\nless than the cost of the entertainment. As a result, it is expected<br />\nthat all special events at the Grad<br />\nClub (band parties, DJ's, movies)<br />\nwill not fully recover their<br />\nexpenses.<br />\nIn contrast, the GRO does not<br />\nfund the daily operation of the<br />\nGrad Club. The sale of food and<br />\nbeverages is expected to be sufficient to meet the weekly expenses of the club. Special<br />\nevents, such as those funded by<br />\nthe GRO, increase the sale of<br />\nfood and beverages. The revenue<br />\nfrom these events helps the Grad<br />\nClub stay open longer hours, and<br />\non days when it is not directly<br />\nprofitable.

He<br />\nstated his belief that the destruction of the black extended family through the welfare system has<br />\nconsequently led to the lack of<br />\nmoral training within the black<br />\ncommunity. He also emphasized<br />\nthat blacks should look to<br />\nthemselves first in attempting to<br />\nrise above their current standing,<br />\nsaying that \"no white is obliged<br />\nto do my business.\"<br />\nEven though he bases his<br />\nbeliefs on the wacky conspiracy<br />\ntheory, Meredith did make an important point here. This point<br />\nshould not be used to discuss all<br />\nblacks at the exclusion of all<br />\nwhites, but rather can be explained in the context of segments of<br />\nall races. The devaluation of the<br />\nfamily's important role in raising<br />\nchildren has consequently led to<br />\na lessening of moral standards.<br />\nbeing open and available to<br />\nstudents as much as possible is a<br />\nfundamental mission of the Grad<br />\nClub.<br />\nAt this time, the Grad Club will<br />\nnot be hosting band parties or DJ<br />\ndance parties.

St A<br />\nAPTT GIFT FtR<br />\ns<br />\nse.noR<br />\nTHE_<br />\n<br />\nThe proposal to use the senior<br />\nclass gift to open another room<br />\nfor A Place To Talk in McCoy<br />\nHall after its renovation next year<br />\ncomes at an opportune time and<br />\nhas special significance to the<br />\nclass of 1991.<br />\nThe gift would be used to furnish and maintain a room in addition to the current APTT under<br />\nBaker Hall. The cost would be<br />\nrelatively small compared to the<br />\nbenefits. A few pieces of furniture and carpeting and some<br />\nfunds to maintain the setting is all<br />\nthat is necessary.<br />\nThis time would be most<br />\nfavorable because of the size of<br />\nthe APTT group and the projected use of McCoy Hall. The<br />\ncurrent members of APTT<br />\nnumber 29 with a training class<br />\nof 31 more which offers us a<br />\nchance to expand into a more<br />\ncampus-wide service.<br />\nThe members are all dedicated<br />\nto helping the Hopkins community. Any of you who have used our<br />\nservices can attest to that. And<br />\nthere are many of you out there<br />\nwho have come to us. Since the<br />\nclass of '91's freshman year, the<br />\nnumber of contacts in the APTT<br />\nroom has increased from 480 in<br />\n'87-'88 to 812 in '89-'90, a rise<br />\nof almost 70 percent. Also,<br />\nMcCoy Hall is slated to become<br />\nmore of a dorm-like building in<br />\nwhich APTT can play the same<br />\nrole for upperclass student as it<br />\ndoes for freshman in a more convenient setting for those classes.<br />\nLastly, and most imporantly,<br />\nthe class of 1991 is more in tune<br />\nwith the kind of service that<br />\nAPTT can offer. The tragedies of<br />\nJames DiCesare and Jonathon<br />\nKurtz offer us a wider perspective of the needs of Hopkins<br />\nstudents and the need for studentrun programs that can help fellow<br />\nclassmates. The new room in<br />\nMcCoy Hall would be dedicated<br />\nto the memory of both Jim and<br />\nJon and, hopefully, become<br />\nbeneficial to future students.<br />\n<br />\nDo You tApwr<br />\nTO 6o 134cK IN<br />\nYOUR_ Box?<br />\n<br />\nThe other suggestions for the<br />\nuse of the senior class gift are<br />\nmuch more risky than the opening of another APTT. While the<br />\nfunding of a campus radio station<br />\nis an intriguing idea, it runs a risk<br />\nof falling victim to the whims of<br />\nstudent interest and the administration. A sand volleyball<br />\ncourt in the freshman quad would<br />\nsoon find itself transformed into<br />\nthe local lavatory for the<br />\nHomewood campus' many small<br />\nanimals, while a playground on<br />\nthe quad would be useful only to<br />\nthe children in the tutorial program and would become an insurance nightmare. If the idea of<br />\na last gift is appealing to the class<br />\nof 1991, these other projects do<br />\nnot seem to be as attractive as the<br />\nopening of another peer counseling room.<br />\nThis is the most opportune time<br />\nto expand the program into the<br />\nupperclass housing because of the<br />\ncoincidence of both a larger<br />\nAPTT group of counselors and<br />\nthe availability of space in the<br />\nnewly renovated McCoy Hall.<br />\nThis class, more than any other,<br />\ncan understand the need for a<br />\npeer counseling group. If you<br />\npledge your support for the senior<br />\nclass gift before November 30,<br />\nyou can cast your vote for how<br />\nthe gift is to be used. So please<br />\npledge and please support the effort to open another APTT in the<br />\nrnembory of Jim DiCesare and<br />\nJon Kurtz.<br />\n<br />\nTo find out what's<br />\namiss at Hopkins, and who<br />\nit affects, turn to<br />\nStephen Kent Jusick's<br />\n'Screw the Right Thing'\u2014<br />\nevery week in Editorial<br />\n<br />\n\f--<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/7<br />\n<br />\nArts<br />\nMarquez Traces Bolivar's Last Days<br />\nIn The General In His Labyrinth<br />\nby Sylvia Alarcon<br />\nWorld-renowned author of<br />\nLove in the Time of Cholera,<br />\nGabriel Garcia Marquez's newest<br />\nnovel is a delightful description<br />\nof one of the greatest mythical<br />\nheroes of South America, Simon<br />\nBolivar, the Great Liberator. To<br />\nunderstand The General in His<br />\nLabyrinth fully, one must plunge<br />\ninto the attitudes, the culture, the<br />\nvery heart of South America<br />\nitself. The romantic legend as<br />\nwell as the deeply passionate<br />\ncharacter of Simon Bolivar embodies the broken yet ever present dreams of a crazy continent.<br />\nThe enigma of Simon Bolivar<br />\nstill inspires little boys with<br />\ndreams of heroic battles against<br />\nnoble enemies. Songs, poems,<br />\nhistory books all capture an<br />\nimage of the General as a powerful yet passionate man whose goal<br />\nof unifying South America \"from<br />\nMexico to Cape Horn\" was his<br />\nlife's ambition.<br />\nGarcia Marquez's book is an<br />\naccount of Simon Bolivar's last<br />\ndays and thus puts the General's<br />\nlife into less ambiguous terms. By<br />\ncreating Bolivar anew, Garcia<br />\nMarquez adds to his dream, making it a more human struggle, in<br />\nwhich Bolivar fights against his<br />\nown increasing pessimism as well<br />\nas his physical disease. To the<br />\nend he attempts to keep up hope,<br />\nto rally the morale of his troops,<br />\nto believe that he has not \"sown<br />\nhis seeds in the sea.\"<br />\n\"Floating naked with his eyes<br />\nopen,\" Bolivar is making<br />\npreparations to leave the drizzly<br />\ncity of Bogota because \"no one<br />\nloves us here.\" Long accustomed to Bolivar's false resignations,<br />\n<br />\nseveral reports of his approaching<br />\ndeath followed by his more<br />\nforceful return to power, no one<br />\nactually believes that he is really<br />\nleaving. Nevertheless, many implore him not go but instead to<br />\n\"make one more sacrifice to save<br />\nthe country.\" Bolivar chooses to<br />\nwait for the Constituent Congress<br />\nto confirm or change his decision.<br />\nBolivar becomes visibly agitated;<br />\nhe is unable to sleep or eat. When<br />\nthe results of his unanimous<br />\ndefeat finally reach him, he says,<br />\n\"no Congress ever saved a<br />\nrepublic.\"<br />\nThus he begins his journey,<br />\nstill careful to remind everyone<br />\nthat he has no passport. Accompanied by his faithful servant,<br />\n<br />\nJose Palacios, as well as his<br />\nclosest military friends, Bolivar's<br />\nlast journey through South<br />\nAmerica is one filled with<br />\nnostalgia.<br />\nHis memory unfolds before<br />\nhim, playing out scenes of his life<br />\nwhich led to his rise in power and<br />\nhis place in history. But he<br />\ndoesn't only recall military campaigns or orders for executions,<br />\nhe also recalls the women of his<br />\nlife, mostly brief affairs to whom<br />\nhe pledged his undying love.<br />\nChief among the women in his<br />\nlife is Manuela Saenz, the bold<br />\nQuitena, who becomes one of the<br />\nfew people the General trusts<br />\nthroughout his life.

Instead, it's the \"normals\" in the<br />\nplay, middle-aged architect<br />\nWillum Cubbert and Washington<br />\nweathergirl Tansy McGinnis,<br />\nwho attempt to reach out to us.<br />\nThe question they pose is a simple one: when is enough enough?<br />\nWillum Cubbert (Scott Cesari)<br />\nis a middle-of-the-road, vanilla<br />\nsort of guy. He's having a rough<br />\ntime with the girl of his dreams,<br />\nTansy (Afua Forson); he's<br />\nfriends with an obnoxious theater<br />\ncritic, Axel Hammond (Lyle<br />\nRoberts); and he's involved in an<br />\nimportant project for a bigshot<br />\ncontractor from the city, Warnock Waldgrave (Gregory P.<br />\nSheahan). The last thing Willum<br />\nneeds is for the man who saved<br />\nhis life in Vietnam to show up and<br />\nstart claiming favors.

In this book, we see<br />\nhim play cards and get frustrated<br />\nbecause he is losing. Colonel<br />\nWilson, who is beating him, is<br />\nordered to lose but the General<br />\nrealizes this and gets up from the<br />\ntable saying, \"you don't have to<br />\ndo it so badly.\" He is not always<br />\ntemperamental, however. When<br />\nhe hears the beautiful voice of<br />\nIturbide, he joins him, teaching<br />\nhim the songs he was too young<br />\nto know.

Certainly Lyle Roberts' Axel<br />\nis one of them; almost every line<br />\nhe delivers is a sarcastic put-down<br />\nor a sneer. Quite a few of his lines<br />\nfell flat, but overall he gets the<br />\nmost laughs. Some of his<br />\nmemorable moments include the<br />\nspeeches to his \"friend\" Jack<br />\nDaniels and the pagan rituals<br />\n(\"pork dancers\") he initiates to<br />\nscare off the nerd.<br />\nFreshman David Savolaine as<br />\n<br />\nticult in the cast. Making putty<br />\nfaces and characterizations is easy<br />\ncompared to presenting the audience with a protagonist they can<br />\nempathize with. Cesari falls<br />\nsomewhat short of this, although<br />\nit's difficult to tell whether the<br />\nfault is in his acting or in the<br />\nscript. He does a good job in the<br />\nfirst act as the mild businessman;<br />\nbut when he starts breaking<br />\nglasses and stomping around after<br />\nthe intermission, you wonder<br />\nwhere he got all that energy.

This is not<br />\na glorified rockumentary that puts<br />\nQuincy Jones on an Olympic<br />\npedestal, nor did he have any part<br />\nin its production or direction. He<br />\nis simply the worthy apple of someone's eye. As his life and work<br />\nare lovingly recounted, one cannot shake the sense that this film<br />\n<br />\nis not just a potrayal but a labor<br />\nof love.<br />\nThe unexpected fast pace of sequences keeps the energy pumping, a thankful shift from other<br />\nplodding documentaries. Sonic<br />\nsequences are even overlapped so<br />\nthat people are talking over<br />\nanother. Incredibly there are no<br />\njangled or lost words. Rather, the<br />\neffect is the verbal background<br />\nmusic, the timbre of two or three<br />\nvoices setting the mood for the<br />\nnext sequence. The music that<br />\npulses through the video<br />\nsegments ranges from Jazz<br />\n(Birdland) to early pop (This is<br />\nMy Party) to soul to rap. One of<br />\nthe more amusing parts has a certain famed rapper being utterly<br />\namazed at the intensity of the<br />\nFrench towards rap music. Ap-<br />\n<br />\nparently, the French intellectualize and analyze each word,<br />\ntreating it with all the.seriousness<br />\nand solemnity they would bring<br />\nto opera.<br />\nAlthough the movie treks from<br />\nboyhood poverty to the realization of young dreams, the story<br />\nis not the standard rags to riches.<br />\nThis film is Quincy Jones as artist, as activist, as philosopher, as<br />\nwell as self-made man. Wellplaced interviews and clips of<br />\nmovies and videos are impressive<br />\nfor their complete lack of<br />\npretense. This makes them<br />\nengagingly real. This also makes<br />\nfor more affecting reception of<br />\nthe staggering amount of impressions that the film flashes in<br />\nalmost two hours.<br />\n<br />\nARE YOU CONCERNED THAT YOU MIGHT<br />\nNOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT YOURSELF IN<br />\nAN ATTACK?<br />\nDO YOU EVER FEEL VULNERABLE?<br />\nDO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SIMPLE<br />\nSAFETY MEASURES?<br />\nIF THE ANSWER TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS IS YES,<br />\nCOME TO THE TWO-PART<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nITS THE 3oL47<br />\n<br />\nNEw FAc:<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\nnerd Steadman is just as engaging. Steadman's character has<br />\nbeen calculated so that all stops<br />\ncan be pulled loose, and<br />\nSavolaine takes him to the furthest extreme that he can. It's<br />\namazing how scrawny and dopey<br />\nhe manages to make himself, and<br />\nthe whine he delivers his lines<br />\nwith is terrific.<br />\nProbably the most consistent of<br />\nthe laugh-makers are the husband<br />\nand wife team of \"Ticky\" and<br />\nClelia Waldgrave (Gregory P.<br />\nSheahan and Sarah Morton).<br />\n\"Ticky,\" a Dukakis look-alike<br />\nwith a Nixon personality, is the<br />\nplay's scapegoat.

The choppy,<br />\nsimple, folky punk songs by<br />\nwhich the Lemonheads have<br />\ncome to be identified requires<br />\nquite a bit of attention and energy<br />\nto perform successfully, neither<br />\nof which the band possessed at<br />\nthis particular show. The bassist<br />\nand drummer, whom Dando failed to identify on stage, were both<br />\nskilled and sharp, but none of the<br />\n<br />\nthree was locking in properly<br />\nwith the others, leaving the total<br />\neffect a punk rock mess.<br />\nLemonheads albums are sloppy<br />\nbut together. This was merely<br />\nsloppy.<br />\nDando also failed to communicate with the audience during the performance; even the<br />\ndrummer (who seemed like he<br />\nwas just sitting in for the evening considering Dando's<br />\nheadstrong attitude), was trying<br />\nto talk it up with the crowd while<br />\nDando shouted at the soundman<br />\nand tried to fix his effect pedals.<br />\nDando's rough, slurred voice<br />\nseemed distant and detached,<br />\nstuck within his songs rather than<br />\nprojecting to the audience. He only seemed to return from his personal headspace after the show,<br />\nwhen he apologized to the fans<br />\nwho hung around and spoke with<br />\na few students, bumming cigarettes and asking about clubs in the<br />\narea where he mightplay on his<br />\nnext trip to Baltimore.<br />\nOnly a few times did the show<br />\nseem to take a turn for the bet-<br />\n<br />\nQuincy Jones' Career<br />\nRecounted In Film<br />\nContinued from page 7<br />\nThe only annoying aspect of<br />\nthe movie is that it almost seems<br />\nto harbor a message within it.<br />\nWhen the subject matter deals<br />\nwith an inspiring spirit such as<br />\nMr. Jones, it becomes ridiculously easy to attach a weighty<br />\nsignificance to what may be<br />\nloosely termed his shining example. There are many opportunites<br />\nto idolize the man because the<br />\ngritty details and drudgery are too<br />\nquickly glossed. His series of failed marriages, his professional<br />\ncrises, all are painted in moody<br />\nblue instead of in shades of<br />\nrealistic gray, so that our sympathy is like a tune played on<br />\nreluctant heartstrings.<br />\n<br />\nPossibly the music of this film,<br />\nmore clearly defines the message<br />\nin an acceptably universal way<br />\nmore than the wordy interviews.<br />\nAs Jones himself says, music is<br />\na strange animal; it is a better<br />\ncommunicator in times of turmoil<br />\nand political stress than anything<br />\nelse because no one can stop the<br />\nmusic from coming in one's<br />\nheart. Music is Quincy Jones'<br />\nphilosophy. It can take anger that<br />\nhas sprung from pain and redirect<br />\nit into love. It is all about thwarting violence and nurturing<br />\npeaceful community. But the<br />\nquestion remains if this is the<br />\nmessage, why did they hide it<br />\nbehind the image of Mr. Jones?<br />\n<br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nFILM<br />\n<br />\nter. \"Ride With Mc\" began as a<br />\nDando solo piece for electric<br />\nguitar, building slowly with kick<br />\ndrum and bass to a full band arrangement. The opener,<br />\n\"Stove,\" held together admirably<br />\nconsidering the drum monitors<br />\nwere off, and the arrival of a<br />\nmysterious fourth member\u2014a<br />\nbourbon-stained guy who looked<br />\nlike Shane MacGowan and<br />\nhollered during the introduction<br />\nof \"Ballarat\"\u2014seemed to charge<br />\nthe performance some more. But<br />\nthe rest of the show seemed<br />\nweaker, an off-night for a band<br />\nthat can do better.<br />\nI felt bad for Jawbox, the opening act, whose crushing fortyminute set was as precise and<br />\nloud as ever. The problem was<br />\nthat only about twenty or thirty<br />\nfans saw their set. \"Hello,<br />\nurn . . Baltimore,\" was the<br />\ngreeting from the trio's singer and<br />\nguitarist, who later asked if any<br />\nHopkins students were actually<br />\npresent.<br />\nIn contrast with Dando's safe<br />\ndistance from the audience, the<br />\nmembers of Jawbox were right in<br />\nthere, even jumping over the<br />\nfoldback monitor amps and falling into the 'crowd,' most of<br />\nwhom were apparently people the<br />\nband knew or had seen before at<br />\ntheir regular D.C. gigs. Their<br />\nblasting post-hardcore mix of<br />\ntough rhythms and odd changes<br />\nand turns was tightly executed<br />\nand well-rehearsed without<br />\nsacrificing<br />\nany<br />\nyouthful<br />\nenthusiasm.<br />\nJawbox was entirely stronger<br />\ndisappointing<br />\nthe<br />\nthan<br />\nperformance,<br />\nand<br />\nLemonheads<br />\nthat<br />\nargue<br />\nwould<br />\none<br />\nno<br />\nthough<br />\nthis was representative of an<br />\naverage Lemonheads show, it<br />\nwas a disconcerting reminder that<br />\na good band has its weaker<br />\nnights.

Here he becomes<br />\nconvinced that it is still possible<br />\nto \"begin again from the beginning, knowing that the enemy<br />\nwas not external but inside the<br />\nhouse.\" Thus he is again<br />\ntransformed from a \"defeated<br />\npensioner fleeing into exile\" into someone capable of carefully<br />\nplanning the steps to realize his<br />\ndream of unity because, as he<br />\nsays, \"all the rest is bullshit.\"<br />\nDeeply intertwined with the<br />\nhistory of South America,<br />\nBolivar's journey is one full of<br />\nfantasy\u2014the memories and<br />\ndreams of Bolivar\u2014and bitter<br />\nreality\u2014the physical sickness of<br />\nBolivar.

After all, he will be eternally sung about, whether with<br />\nWords of praise or scorn. Garcia<br />\nMarquez's book is another of the<br />\nmany volumes written about this<br />\nman.

Principe noted that many of Boyle's<br />\npapers contained recipes for<br />\nalchemy and codes used by Boyle<br />\nin recording his work.<br />\nlAlchemists were interested in the<br />\nconversion or transformation of<br />\n\"baser\" metals (i.e. lead, iron)<br />\ninto gold.] \"The lesson for<br />\nmodern scholars,\" Dr. Principe<br />\nsaid, \"is that almost none of the<br />\nrecords left to us by alchemists<br />\ncan he read at face value. When<br />\nan alchemist writes of mercury or<br />\nsulfur, he may mean hundreds of<br />\ndifferent things. The same author<br />\nmay use the same word in the<br />\nsame text and mean many different things by it, which can only<br />\nhe identified by studying the context.\"<br />\n\"One of my goals,\" Dr. Principe said, \"is to demonstrate the<br />\nImportance of alchemy to the<br />\n<br />\nhistory of science and to show<br />\nthat alchemy cannot be dismissed out of hand as a worthless and<br />\npast endeavor, simply because the<br />\nalchemist had a world view different from our own.\"<br />\nOnly recently have historians<br />\nrealized the significance of<br />\nalchemy and its close connection<br />\nwith the development of<br />\nchemistry. Apart from their practical search for methods of<br />\ntransforming metals, and for elixirs of youth and prolonged life,<br />\nthese \"scientists\" had solid<br />\ntheories and actually conducted<br />\nexperiments to test their<br />\nhypotheses.<br />\nDuring the late Medieval and<br />\nRenaissance period, alchemy was<br />\nwidely practiced in the Western<br />\nWorld. Many alchemists did not<br />\nwish to reveal their trade secrets,<br />\nand to preserve the esoteric nature<br />\nof thier practices, they devised<br />\nmany concealing, symbolic<br />\nnames for the used materials.<br />\nThis secrecy prevented many<br />\nhistorians from understanding the<br />\nimportance of their study, which<br />\nmany glossed over as mystical<br />\n<br />\nallegory.<br />\nDr. Principe's current research<br />\nfocuses on Robert Boyle, an<br />\nEnglish natural philosopher who<br />\nlived from 1627 to 1691. Boyle,<br />\nas Principe explains, was interested in the transformation of<br />\nmatter, but more specifically in<br />\nthe making of gold. Boyle's pursuit was strictly for scientific purposes. Principe explains that<br />\nBoyle's work delved into<br />\nspiritualism. According to Principe, Boyle believed that a close<br />\nadherence to the mechanical<br />\nphilosophy of atomism, in which<br />\nall actions are explained<br />\nmechanistically, would lead to<br />\natheism. Boyle wanted to show<br />\nthat there were spiritual forces<br />\nbeyond the mechanist world, proving that there is a god.<br />\nApart from the chemical<br />\naspects, the science of alchemy<br />\nstrove to link the natural and<br />\nsupernatural worlds. These scientists or natural philosophers were<br />\ninterested in the improvement of<br />\nthe human soul and the entire<br />\nhuman race, from the fall of man<br />\nto the reunification of man with<br />\n<br />\nToo much thyme on your<br />\nhands?

We had lunch<br />\ntogether and she let me record<br />\npart ofour conversation. This is<br />\nYumi's story:<br />\n\"<br />\nI was born in Kyoto prefixure in a town called Miyazu, facing the Japan Sea, and I lived in<br />\nthis town until I was twelve years<br />\nold. 1 had a Japanese name,<br />\nUeno, which I used up to the age<br />\nof twenty. When I entered junior<br />\nhigh school my family moved to<br />\nKyoto city. Before that I never<br />\nexperienced any discrimination as<br />\na Korean. In my new school, I<br />\nstarted to feel uneasy because I<br />\nstarted to hear the negative<br />\nwords.<br />\nWhat were some ofthe negative<br />\nwords?<br />\nIn school, children say Chosenjin [Korean] in a negative way,<br />\nlike Chosenjin is a word to<br />\nthreaten people. My friends at<br />\nschool just said Chosenjin to cut<br />\ndown anything they didn't like.<br />\n1 started to feel uneasy. I knew<br />\nI was different but I didn't know<br />\nI was Korean, I just thought<br />\nmaybe my family was not<br />\nJapanese. I entered high school<br />\nand the situation got more severe.<br />\n.1 was feeling smaller and smaller.<br />\nI was afraid to be found out that<br />\nI was Korean.<br />\nAfter I graduated from high<br />\nschool I wanted to go to college<br />\nto become a physical education<br />\nteacher but discouragingly, I<br />\nfound out Korean people can't be<br />\nteachers.<br />\nHow come? Who told you<br />\nthis)?<br />\nI was talking about my future<br />\nwith my sister and she said I<br />\ncouldn't be a teacher because of<br />\nmy nationality. I found out that<br />\nno Koreans are hired.<br />\nI didn't know what to do. I<br />\ngraduated and I didn't know<br />\nwhere to go. I met two American<br />\npeople in the street downtown and<br />\nI wanted to help them because<br />\n<br />\nthey seemed to be lost. I helped<br />\nthem with broken, broken<br />\nEnglish and I found out it's great<br />\nto get to know other people from<br />\nother countries.<br />\nI entered a junior college in<br />\nKyoto where I majored in<br />\nEnglish. I met teachers with<br />\nwhom I could speak out to on<br />\nhow I was feeling, how the situation is awful for Korean people.<br />\nYou could speak out toforeign<br />\npeople?<br />\n<br />\nname and went on to cal! other<br />\nstudents' names and during that<br />\ntime I was thinking what should<br />\nI do, that I shouldn't lose this<br />\nchance, and I raised my hand and<br />\nsaid, 'Miss Crawford, my name<br />\nis not Ueno, so you can call me<br />\nLee from today.' And that was<br />\nthe starting point of where I am<br />\nright now.<br />\nI was quite afraid of the reactions of my classmates. After<br />\nclass my friends and other<br />\n<br />\nRunning a racism<br />\nThe Japanese government condones discrimination against Koreans.<br />\nOnly in college. When I was a<br />\nsecond year student I went to the<br />\nStates for the first time; it was a<br />\nhomestay program. On my<br />\npassport my name is Yumi Lee.<br />\nso I used the name Yumi Lee,<br />\nwhich was unfamiliar to use. I felt<br />\nlike a different person or<br />\nsomething. I remember I was living with an American family and<br />\nthey had no prejudice; they didn't<br />\ncare if I was Japanese or Korean.<br />\nI felt so free and great, and back<br />\nin Japan I told my emotions to my<br />\nprofessor in college. I was telling her how I felt in the States and<br />\nwhat's wrong with Japanese<br />\nsociety and how I felt in Japan<br />\nand she understood.<br />\nIn the classroom she was calling the students' names, all<br />\nJapanese names, and she stopped<br />\nin front of my name. She used to<br />\ncall Miss Ueno and check it, but<br />\nthis time she stopped in front of<br />\nmy name and she said, 'Miss<br />\nUeno, what should I call you<br />\nfrom today?' I was totally at a<br />\nloss. I was not prepared; my<br />\nfriends were there. It was such a<br />\nbig moment, I couldn't say<br />\nstraightforwardly, 'My name is<br />\nLee,' I just held my breath and<br />\nsaid, 'I'm at a loss, just give me<br />\nsonic time.' She skipped my<br />\n<br />\nstudents came up to me and said,<br />\n'So you're not Japanese? Where's<br />\nthe Lee from? How come you<br />\nspeak good Japanese?' They had<br />\nno idea of who I was.<br />\nI graduated from college, but<br />\nthere were no jobs available for<br />\nKorean people. Maybe unskilled<br />\njobs, but I wanted to utilize my<br />\nabilities like English, and I knew<br />\nI could do better than working in<br />\nan office making copies and doing clerical work. I wanted to<br />\nwork in a travel agency or as a<br />\nstewardess for JAL (Japanese<br />\nAir) but no, so I was working<br />\npart-time as a teacher.<br />\nSo did you become a teacher?<br />\nOnly part time at a very small<br />\nEnglish school.<br />\nIn the paper I read there were<br />\nopen positions for stewardesses<br />\non Korean Air. I thought, this is<br />\nit. A Korean company, and what<br />\nI wanted to do. I applied for it and<br />\nwas luckily hired. I flew to Korea<br />\nand the States, back and forth.<br />\nThe situation was not great for me<br />\nbecause in those days I wanted a<br />\nplace to call home, a country. I<br />\nregarded Korea as my country<br />\nbecause I traveled there two years<br />\nbefore, but that was for just a<br />\nshort time. I started to see Korea<br />\nin a deeper sense and found out<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nConcert Band<br />\nAnnounces<br />\nIts Fall Concert<br />\n<br />\nI'm not Korean there. They don't<br />\naccept me because I'm from<br />\nJapan and I don't speak Korean<br />\nlike a native person.<br />\nBut I was working and I was<br />\ntraveling. I loved being in the<br />\nsky, where I couldn't see any<br />\nborders. I didn't want to be in<br />\nJapan, I didn't want to be in<br />\nKorea, I just wanted to be<br />\nsomewhere. I realized I was just<br />\na human being. Maybe I can't call<br />\nanywhere my hometown, but<br />\nthat's fine, I can belong to<br />\nmyself. That's easy to say, but I<br />\nhad a lot of slanders from both the<br />\nKorean people and the Japanese<br />\npeople. I quit my job and I went<br />\nto England to brush up on my<br />\nEnglish and to find out what I<br />\ncould do in the future.<br />\nLast year I went to Korea to<br />\nbrush up my Korean and to find<br />\nmy roots. I came back last<br />\nSeptember and I read many,<br />\nmany books and journals that<br />\ncover the history of how Japan invaded Korea and how Korean<br />\npeople came over here. It was a<br />\nrealization of why I'm here.<br />\nLooking back to my grandparents' period, I found out the<br />\nhistory of what Japan did that we<br />\nnever learned in school.<br />\nWhat did they tell you in<br />\nschool?<br />\nSince Japanese history is so<br />\n'long, 3000 years, by the time we<br />\nreach recent history, school is<br />\nover. We learned practically no<br />\nWorld War history. We didn't<br />\nlearn about Pearl Harbor; we only learned about the atomic bomb<br />\nbecause Japan is a victim-minded<br />\ncountry.<br />\nThey didn't cover Pearl Harbor<br />\nin class?<br />\nI didn't know about it until I<br />\nmet American people. There is<br />\nno reflection on Japan's past, like<br />\non what they've done in Asia.<br />\nAnd I was shocked just going<br />\nthrough photographs and reading.<br />\nI started to study what made<br />\nJapanese people do that. It's just<br />\ninsane, it's like Germany, and I<br />\ndidn't like to be emotional, but I<br />\nwanted to know what made people do that. And after people<br />\nmake a mistake, what should be<br />\ndone compensation-wise? And<br />\nthat is what I've been doing.<br />\nWhat is the main issue you're<br />\nfighting now?<br />\nA real oppressing thing is<br />\nfingerprinting. You have to carry<br />\na registration card when you<br />\nbecom sixteen years old.<br />\nDo all Japanese carry the<br />\nregistration card orjust Koreans?<br />\nAll foreign people. We are all<br />\ntreated the same way, as temporary foreigners. And that's the<br />\nconstant realization from your<br />\nhigh school period on--that you<br />\nare a foreigner, an outsider.<br />\nOther foreigners who reside here<br />\nfor more than one year are also<br />\nfingerprinted. My objection is<br />\nthat fingerprinting is wrong as<br />\nidentification because identification for Japanese people is just<br />\nlike a driver's license. This law<br />\nis meant to control Korean people and treat Korean people as<br />\npotential criminals.<br />\nWhy? Because criminals also<br />\nhave to be fingerprinted?<br />\nYes, and also politically we are<br />\ncontrolled, supervised.<br />\nHow is fingerprinting used to<br />\ncontrol?<br />\nIt's kept in the war office and<br />\n<br />\nAt 8:00 P.M.<br />\nIn Shriver Hall<br />\n<br />\nFree Admission<br />\nFree Refreshments<br />\nCall 366-2726 for more information<br />\n<br />\nthings.

I used to think this was<br />\nto save suffering of Korean people, but now I think it's for<br />\nJapanese society. Japan is such a<br />\nfamous economic country, they<br />\nneed to also have to deal with the<br />\nworld on a more human level.

With Frank<br />\nGangemi in street clothes and<br />\nScott Cade leaving the game in<br />\nthe second quarter with bruised<br />\nligaments on the knuckles of his<br />\nthrowing hand, the Jays played an<br />\ninspired game. The defense stopped two Dickinson scoring attempts in the final three minutes<br />\nto preserve the tie, on the frozen<br />\ntundra of Homewood Field. The<br />\ntie left Hopkins with a 3-4-1<br />\nrecord and a clear indication that<br />\nthe program has turned the<br />\ncorner.<br />\n\"I think we made a statement<br />\nto them that we can play ball,\"<br />\nsaid John Guglielmo. \"We would<br />\nhave liked to have won, but I<br />\nthink Dickinson knew we beat<br />\nthem.

The loss of Frank<br />\nGangemi to a knee injury added<br />\nenormous pressure to the defense.<br />\nWithout their top lineman, or<br />\nstrong safety Tom Baugher, who<br />\nwas suffering neck burners,<br />\nHopkins needed a great performance from their defensive line.<br />\nThanks to Dave Erfle, this goal<br />\nwas met. Erfle gave one of the<br />\nbest individual performances of<br />\nthe year from his defensive tackle<br />\nposition. He recorded seventeen<br />\ntackles and forced the Dickinson<br />\nline into numerous holding<br />\npenalties.<br />\n\"We played some very fine<br />\ndefense,\" said Jim Margraff.<br />\n\"To play the way we did without<br />\nGangemi or Baugher, we are<br />\nreally pleased. Dave (Erfle) was<br />\nfantastic. You rarely see a defensive lineman play a football game<br />\nlike that.\" One other player worthy of note was linebacker Brian<br />\nCooke. Gangemi's knee injury<br />\nforced Cooke to play defensive<br />\nline for the first time in his career.<br />\nThe crash course in defensive line<br />\nplay payed huge benefits as<br />\nCooke made seven tackles, with<br />\na number of them coming late in<br />\nthe ball game.<br />\n\"Brian did a super job,\" said<br />\nMargraff. \"He had never played<br />\ndefensive line before. In the<br />\npregame he didn't even line up in<br />\na three point stance. He lined up<br />\nin a two point stance at tackle.\"<br />\nBoth teams appeared sluggish<br />\nin the opening minutes, before the<br />\n<br />\nJays received the first break of the<br />\ngame. Lou Angelos' punt from<br />\nmidfield was fumbled and<br />\nrecovered by Blue Jay freshman<br />\nStephen Murphy on Dickinson's<br />\n26 yard line.

It was a beautiful run that<br />\nincluded a series of shake-andbake moves. Guglielmo found<br />\nFerrari again on a short out pattern that the running back took 49<br />\nyards for the touchdown. It was<br />\na nifty play, because Ferreri<br />\nused Joe Richards as a screen<br />\nalong the sidelines. Once he<br />\ncaught the ball, Ferreri made a<br />\nright turn at Richards' shoulder,<br />\nwho blocked the late arriving<br />\ndefender, and scampered up the<br />\nsidelines for the score. Trotta's<br />\nextra point gave the Jays a 7-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nThe half ended without any further scoring. Dave Erfle had<br />\nalreay played a tremendous<br />\ngame, with a number of driveending plays in the half.

We<br />\nmade a couple of poor team plays<br />\nand they scored on some flukes,\"<br />\nshe said. The Hopkins defense<br />\nheld Messiah in check during<br />\nsettled play, allowing one goal off<br />\na corner (in thirteen attempts),<br />\nand one on a \"nice pass play.\"<br />\nHopkins started quick as they<br />\ntook the opening ball down the<br />\nfield and fired a shot. However,<br />\nMessiah recovered and sent the<br />\nball to their strong forward line<br />\nwhile the Blue Jays managed only two more shots for the rest of<br />\nthe game. \"They were very fast<br />\nbreaking and had a quick transition.

Anderson is<br />\ncounting on King, who has<br />\nallowed only 17 goals in 16<br />\ngames for a 1.02 goals against<br />\naverage, to have another of her<br />\nbig games. The coach is also hoping that Blitz can see more playing time and the team can recover<br />\nfrom the mental. errors that contributed to the championship loss.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins has had 14-2<br />\nrecords (compared to this years<br />\n10-4-2) in the past, they have<br />\nbeen overlooked by the NCAA<br />\nTournament Selection Committee.

I.<br />\nbuttressed by my virulent commitment to reader education and<br />\na new stack of \"Shape\"<br />\nmagazines (rumored to be filled<br />\nwith some wacky injuries), intend<br />\nto extend IOTW to it's unfunny<br />\ndemise.<br />\nThis renewal, however, is not<br />\nonly a product of my singular<br />\ndesire to see \"injury\" extended<br />\n(or hyper-extended) to its most<br />\npainful length. Instead, I must<br />\ngive credit where credit is due.<br />\n101W typist and universal friend<br />\nof the borderline humorous,<br />\nTierney \"I've fallen and I can't<br />\nget up\" Sherwin, first inspired<br />\nme to resurrect \"Injury.\" Next,<br />\nthe New York Jets coach Bruce<br />\nCoslet stated that wide receiver<br />\nAl Toon had been \"playing with<br />\na broken back,\" and while<br />\nthe condition was not career<br />\nthreatening, it had affected his onfield performance. Coach<br />\nCoslet's been spewing exactly the<br />\nkind of disinformation which<br />\nkeeps IOTW alive and kicking<br />\n(and since the Jets beat the Oilers<br />\nhe can spew whatever he wants).<br />\nToon actually had a fractured<br />\nvertebra. He is no longer risk in<br />\n<br />\nparalysis, and is not playing as a<br />\nmember of the proverbial \"walking wounded.\" Finally, I'd like<br />\nto thank the 101W fans who<br />\nmentioned that they liked the column, or gave me the ultimate<br />\ncompliment: \"Yeah, I think I had<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nEnough fluff; I know you want<br />\nthe pure science that made this<br />\ncolumn famous. Consider the hip<br />\npointer; certainly it is among the<br />\nmost inane sounding of sports injuries. Questions rush to one's<br />\nhead. What is it? What does it<br />\npoint to? Here's the dirt: you<br />\nmight think two different injuries<br />\nare a hip pointer.'The first, a contusion (bruise) of the great<br />\ntrochanter of the femur (hip bone)<br />\nis the true culprit. This painful<br />\nbruising of the bony protruberance in one's hip, is not a<br />\ncommon injury for athletes who<br />\nhave developed thigh muscles<br />\n(although most hacks who have<br />\ntaken a tumble on the turf have<br />\nprobably experienced this). The<br />\npseudo-hip pointer, that pointy<br />\npelvic condition, is a contusion of<br />\nthe crest of the ilium. This is<br />\nmore common, and can occur<br />\ndespite developed thigh muscles<br />\nand thorough padding. I'm happy, hope you're all happy too; a<br />\nmystery has been solved.

They<br />\nwere 16-9 losers to the host<br />\nschool, and 18-3 victims to Navy.<br />\nWhat made the losses easier to<br />\nswallow, however, was that both<br />\nopponents were Division I<br />\nschools.

The Jays<br />\nwill not lose any players to<br />\ngraduation. \"Our goal is to get<br />\nan at-large bid,\" Jones said.<br />\n\"Our focus is going to be Dickinson.

Many at Homewood were more than willing to grant Richardson a chance to prove his commitment to undergraduates. But on<br />\nthe eveidence of his remarks\u2014and remarks and remarks\u2014the president is fast joining the ranks of the noncommittal. His October 15<br />\nspeech to the trustees includes only two substantial mentions of<br />\nundergraduates: an admission of the \"need to focus on the quality<br />\nof undergraduate education\" and a nebulous reference to a Freshman<br />\nSeminar program.<br />\nThe News-Letter doesn't aim to sound the alarm or call Richardson a fraud. But upon examining the text of his speech, which was<br />\nprinted in the October 29 edition of the Gazette, we find sufficient<br />\nevidence to make us uneasy. Not only does the president marginalize<br />\nundergraduates to the point of inaudability\u2014he gives no indication<br />\nof their widespread dissatisfaction\u2014but he plunges head-first into the<br />\nJohns Hopkins \"international reputation\" rhetoric that was supposedly<br />\na thing of the past. In the closing sentences of his speech, Richardson announces confidently that \"Johns Hopkins will increasingly be<br />\nseen. . . as a leading international research university\u2014one of a very<br />\nsmall number of American universities, perhaps no greater than five<br />\nor six in number, whose names are immediately recognizable<br />\nanywhere in the world.\"<br />\nBut what good is brand-name recognition if the quality of the<br />\nproduct\u2014or at least its undergraduate item\u2014seems locked in a cycle<br />\nof decline? More to the point, how can we ensure quality-control<br />\nin our education? When the Office of the Ombudsman was created<br />\nin July 1988, it seemed at least one potential conduit for undergraduate<br />\ncomplaints about the University. To be fair, it may still be a legitimate<br />\nchannel, though on the evidence of the Second Annual Report of the<br />\nOffice of the Ombudsman (also published in Monday's Gazette), one<br />\ngets the idea that Sigmund Suskind also spends a good deal of his<br /><br />\ntime performing.<br />\nIt's not that Suskind and his office intend to be specious; they were<br />\nborn that way. As the report states, the Ombudsman's office \"is not<br />\npart of the formal structure of the University.\" And it was never<br />\nmeant to be, at former president Steven Muller's behest. Doesn't<br />\nthat mean that the Office can be objective about controversial issues?<br />\nYes, but unfortunately, that precious anonymity also leaves the Ombudsman without substantial authority. Suskind refers to his office<br />\nas a \"designated neutral,\" and it's an apt term. Impartial but ineffective, the Office of the Ombudsman sounds great on paper. But<br />\nas a tool for effecting concrete changes, it leaves nearly everything<br />\nto be desired.<br />\nAll of this however, should not be a signal to undergraduates to<br />\ngrin and pay it. There's plenty that one can do to voice his or her<br />\nopinion to the administration. Direct correspondence with administrators is a tried and effective method. Better still is to have<br />\nyour parents mail in their complaints; that will get some attention.<br />\nDemonstrations and petitions\u2014these things do surface at places other<br />\nthan Berkeley\u2014are often tremendously succesful at gaining the attention of the powers in Garland.<br />\nAction is essential. When Richardson first came to Hopkins, he<br />\nseemed cautious and spoke earnestly of a commitment to<br />\nundergraduates. The implication was that he was here to help us.<br />\nWell, The Johns Hopkins University is a gargantuan institution\u2014<br />\nthe government will likely allocate $650 million to it in fiscal<br />\n1991\u2014and it often takes loud, consistent complaining to be heard<br />\nover the din of such impressive figures. Richardson seems increasingly preoccupied with developments abroad. We should take steps<br />\nto make sure he doesn't forget about us.<br />\nBeyond those mentioned above, the News-Letter, not surprisingly, is attached to the idea of spreading \"the bad word\" via the printed<br />\nword. There are several publications at Hopkins\u2014The Spectator,<br />\nPerspectives, and the fledgling PSU newspaper come immediately<br />\nto mind\u2014that could work with us toward this end. It's no mystery<br />\nthat Hopkins is riddled with problems. What is puzzling is why the<br />\nundergraduate population is so quiet about them.<br />\nIt's time to speak up before the new regime learns to ignore us.<br />\nas skillfully as the old one did. Find a mouthpiece\u2014a letter to the<br />\nEditor of a campus publication, a meeting with the dean of your<br />\nchoice, or perhaps something more visually arresting\u2014and state your<br />\ncase. Get fellow students involved. You don't have to assume that<br />\nall is wrong in the Hopkins world, or that the administration is ignorant until proven guilty.

Our organization had<br />\nsome reservations about getting involved in this issue. As such, the<br />\npetition has just been written up and<br />\nis long overdue.<br />\nThe petition gives four reasons<br />\nwhy a strong ROTC program is advantageous. The reasons themselves<br />\nare indisputable. What every<br />\nHopkins student must decide is<br />\nwhether these factors should be ignored in favor of making a statement. Is it worth denying a student<br />\na chance to attend Hopkins via a<br />\nROTC scholarship in order to make<br />\na statement against the defense<br />\ndepartment?<br />\nThe petition is silent on the question of whether the armed forces'<br />\npolicy excluding homosexuals is<br />\njust.

GALA has realized this<br />\nand repeatedly written into this<br />\npaper.

I must object to the News-Letter's practice of<br />\nwriting an editorial condemning<br />\nMcCoy residents for being selfish<br />\nPuritans opposed to a little loud<br />\nmusic from the Grad Club, when<br />\nthere was no attempt to gather facts<br />\nand present them in a corresponding<br />\narticle. Standard journalistic procedure calls tor an objective news<br />\naccount of a situation to accompany<br />\nan official editorial position. At no<br />\npoint did the News-Letter contact any<br /><br />\nMcCoy resident and attempt to obtain a full account of the situation.<br />\nInstead, the so-called facts were based solely on information supplied by<br />\nthe Grad Club managers.<br />\nUndoubtedly, the Grad Club plays<br />\nan important role on a campus where<br />\noutlets for live music are few and far<br />\nbetween. What needs to be said,<br />\nhowever, is that those McCoy<br />\nresidents most affected by Grad Club<br />\nnoise are also those located next to<br />\nthe construction noise of Wolman<br />\nHall. The News-Letter tells us we<br />\nshould cope with loud music until<br />\none a.m., but ignores the realities of<br />\ndeafening construction noise, often<br />\nbeginnng at 6 a.m. While the new<br />\nWolman will certainly be a welcome<br />\naddition, the effect of Wolman construction on the residents of McCoy<br />\nand other nearby buildings is<br />\nperhaps the most ignored story of the<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe News-Letter is correct in that<br />\ndecisions about the Grad Club, or for<br />\nthat matter any other program that<br />\naffects students, should not be made<br />\narbitrarily and without student input.<br />\nBlaming the residents of McCoy for<br />\nthe University's failure to provide<br />\nadequate programming space on<br />\ncampus is counter-productive. Instead of playing into a divide-andconquer strategy, the News-Letter<br />\nand concerned students should be<br />\nasking themselves some harder questions, such as why Ivy Hall, the<br />\nUniversity-owned property on 33rd<br />\nStreet, remains empty and unused.<br />\nPerhaps if the News-Letter took news<br />\na little more seriously, we would all<br />\nbe a little better off.<br />\nJonathan Roberts<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI would just like to respond to<br />\nKevin McCrea's \"Right Angle\" in<br /><br />\nthe October 26th issue of the News- anti-civilization Bolshevist conLetter.

It<br />\ncontains information culled largely from the Undergraduate<br />\nAcademic Manual, with some<br />\ndetailing<br />\nmaterial<br />\nnew<br />\npunishments for misconduct.<br />\nTypically it contains half-answers<br />\nwhile trying to abridge the rights<br />\nof students.<br />\nWhat is disturbing about the<br />\ndocument is its totalitarian tone.<br />\nIt opens with a statement of Expectations that informs readers<br />\nthat students who are \"a danger<br />\nto their own personal safety. .. will be disciplined.\" According to the administration, acts<br />\nrequiring discipline are things<br />\n\"which have the potential of harming others.\" These stipulations<br />\nare so broadly drawn that they<br />\ncould encompass anything from<br />\njuggling with knives to driving<br /><br />\n(an automobile is a weapon, you<br />\nknow).<br />\nThe \"Sanctions\" section, comprising material heretofore uncodified, demonstrates the unforgiving feel of the mailing. The<br />\nword \"sanction\" itself is a legal<br />\nterm that connotes penalties for<br />\ndisobedience. The mildest of the<br />\nsanctions, \"probation,\" also has<br />\na jurisprudential sense; it brings<br />\nto mind a regular program of<br />\ncheck-ups by the local Keystone<br />\nCops. Interestingly, a second offense while on probation will lead<br />\nto suspension or expulsion, the<br />\nfinal two prescribed punishments.<br />\n(There are no gradations at<br />\nHopkins.)<br />\nOnce again the University is<br />\nusing its powers of discrimination<br />\nin disregard to students living in<br />\nHopkins-owned housing.

No, I am not<br />\ntalking about Lincoln vs.<br />\nDouglas; nor about Kennedy vs.<br />\nNixon; I am talking about Dr.<br />\nLombardi vs. Charles Sykes.<br />\nIn that debate, Dr. Lombardi<br />\nmade rhetorical history when he<br />\ncountered Mr. Sykes' argument<br />\nthat American universities were<br />\nfailing in their mission towards<br />\nundergraduates by comparing the<br />\nAmerican higher education<br />\nsystem to a taco.<br />\nIn a rhetorical construct that<br />\nleft the crowd trembling, Dr.<br />\nLombardi argued that Mr. Sykes'<br />\narguments failed because they<br />\ntried to group together schools<br />\nwith different resources and different goals.

The<br />\nwhole Statement of Expectations<br />\nis indistinct. One of the misdeeds<br />\nleading to forfeiture of student<br />\nstatus is \"behavior which tends<br />\nto impair the University's purpose or its reputation.\" The<br />\nUniversity's purpose, to all<br />\nobservers, has nothing to do with<br />\nundergraduates, and everything<br />\nto do with money. Most students<br />\nare not in a position (but in opposition) to slow the flow of<br />\ndollars Hopkins coffers. Closing<br />\nthe much-ballyhooed radio station, or racking up a large deficit<br />\ntend to impair the University's<br />\nreputation more than any student<br />\never could.<br />\nThe use of \"tends\" is a<br />\nstrategic choice. As an indefinite<br />\nverb, it weakens the specificity<br />\nthat \"impairing\" alone would<br />\nlend to the rule. As expectations<br />\nare now, almost anything could<br />\n\"tend to impair\" the much inflated Hopkins reputation\u2014even<br />\nthe truth. By structuring the rules<br />\nin a nebulous manner, with<br />\nlanguage that invites mutable interpretation, the University has<br />\ncreated circumstances where<br />\nplain statements of detracting<br />\nfact, let alone whistle-blowing,<br />\nwould be punishable.<br />\nThe sudden appearance of these<br />\nexpanded regulations begs a question. Why? Did something occur<br />\nrecently that caught the administration off guard? If the information in this handout is<br />\navailable in the Academic Manual<br />\ngiven to all undergraduates, why<br />\nre-release it now? This mass<br />\nmailing wasn't expensive (less<br /><br />\nthan $300 by crude calculations)<br />\nbut was it necessary? A far more<br />\negregious example of gross excess is the glossy guide to Maintaining A Drug-Free Environment, from the Substance Abuse<br />\nProgram. Where is discretion in<br />\nthese times of austerity?<br />\nThe fact that this warning sheet<br />\nexists at all (the title is almost<br />\nself-deprecating) brings up the<br />\nissues of morality and ethics in<br />\ngeneral.

But the lack<br />\nof a formalized code is not<br />\nbecause Hopkins students are so<br />\nfar above it. To the contrary, the<br />\nvery frequency of infractions<br />\nmade it untenable. An ethics<br />\nboard exists to investigate complaints, but it is only a reactive<br />\nbody. Freshmen and new students<br />\nare not formally introduced to or<br />\nasked to sign an honor code, even<br />\nof their own volition.

Therefore, I<br />\npresume that he is responsible for<br />\nmonitoring students' performance<br />\nand running the day-to-day operations of the school.

The cost would be<br />\nrelatively small compared to the<br />\nbenefits. A few pieces of furniture and carpeting and some<br />\nfunds to maintain the setting is all<br />\nthat is necessary.<br />\nThis time would be most<br />\nfavorable because of the size of<br />\nthe APTT group and the projected use of McCoy Hall. The<br />\ncurrent members of APTT<br />\nnumber 29 with a training class<br />\nof 31 more which offers us a<br />\nchance to expand into a more<br />\ncampus-wide service.<br />\nThe members are all dedicated<br />\nto helping the Hopkins community. Any of you who have used our<br />\nservices can attest to that. And<br />\nthere are many of you out there<br />\nwho have come to us. Since the<br />\nclass of '91's freshman year, the<br />\nnumber of contacts in the APTT<br />\nroom has increased from 480 in<br />\n'87-'88 to 812 in '89-'90, a rise<br />\nof almost 70 percent. Also,<br />\nMcCoy Hall is slated to become<br />\nmore of a dorm-like building in<br />\nwhich APTT can play the same<br />\nrole for upperclass student as it<br />\ndoes for freshman in a more convenient setting for those classes.<br />\nLastly, and most imporantly,<br />\nthe class of 1991 is more in tune<br />\nwith the kind of service that<br />\nAPTT can offer. The tragedies of<br />\nJames DiCesare and Jonathon<br />\nKurtz offer us a wider perspective of the needs of Hopkins<br />\nstudents and the need for studentrun programs that can help fellow<br />\nclassmates. The new room in<br />\nMcCoy Hall would be dedicated<br />\nto the memory of both Jim and<br />\nJon and, hopefully, become<br />\nbeneficial to future students.<br /><br />\nDo You tApwr<br />\nTO 6o 134cK IN<br />\nYOUR_ Box?<br /><br />\nThe other suggestions for the<br />\nuse of the senior class gift are<br />\nmuch more risky than the opening of another APTT. While the<br />\nfunding of a campus radio station<br />\nis an intriguing idea, it runs a risk<br />\nof falling victim to the whims of<br />\nstudent interest and the administration. A sand volleyball<br />\ncourt in the freshman quad would<br />\nsoon find itself transformed into<br />\nthe local lavatory for the<br />\nHomewood campus' many small<br />\nanimals, while a playground on<br />\nthe quad would be useful only to<br />\nthe children in the tutorial program and would become an insurance nightmare. If the idea of<br />\na last gift is appealing to the class<br />\nof 1991, these other projects do<br />\nnot seem to be as attractive as the<br />\nopening of another peer counseling room.<br />\nThis is the most opportune time<br />\nto expand the program into the<br />\nupperclass housing because of the<br />\ncoincidence of both a larger<br />\nAPTT group of counselors and<br />\nthe availability of space in the<br />\nnewly renovated McCoy Hall.<br />\nThis class, more than any other,<br />\ncan understand the need for a<br />\npeer counseling group.

To<br />\nunderstand The General in His<br />\nLabyrinth fully, one must plunge<br />\ninto the attitudes, the culture, the<br />\nvery heart of South America<br />\nitself. The romantic legend as<br />\nwell as the deeply passionate<br />\ncharacter of Simon Bolivar embodies the broken yet ever present dreams of a crazy continent.<br />\nThe enigma of Simon Bolivar<br />\nstill inspires little boys with<br />\ndreams of heroic battles against<br />\nnoble enemies.

By<br />\ncreating Bolivar anew, Garcia<br />\nMarquez adds to his dream, making it a more human struggle, in<br />\nwhich Bolivar fights against his<br />\nown increasing pessimism as well<br />\nas his physical disease. To the<br />\nend he attempts to keep up hope,<br />\nto rally the morale of his troops,<br />\nto believe that he has not \"sown<br />\nhis seeds in the sea.\"<br />\n\"Floating naked with his eyes<br />\nopen,\" Bolivar is making<br />\npreparations to leave the drizzly<br />\ncity of Bogota because \"no one<br />\nloves us here.\" Long accustomed to Bolivar's false resignations,<br /><br />\nseveral reports of his approaching<br />\ndeath followed by his more<br />\nforceful return to power, no one<br />\nactually believes that he is really<br />\nleaving. Nevertheless, many implore him not go but instead to<br />\n\"make one more sacrifice to save<br />\nthe country.\" Bolivar chooses to<br />\nwait for the Constituent Congress<br />\nto confirm or change his decision.<br />\nBolivar becomes visibly agitated;<br />\nhe is unable to sleep or eat. When<br />\nthe results of his unanimous<br />\ndefeat finally reach him, he says,<br />\n\"no Congress ever saved a<br />\nrepublic.\"<br />\nThus he begins his journey,<br />\nstill careful to remind everyone<br />\nthat he has no passport. Accompanied by his faithful servant,<br /><br />\nJose Palacios, as well as his<br />\nclosest military friends, Bolivar's<br />\nlast journey through South<br />\nAmerica is one filled with<br />\nnostalgia.<br />\nHis memory unfolds before<br />\nhim, playing out scenes of his life<br />\nwhich led to his rise in power and<br />\nhis place in history. But he<br />\ndoesn't only recall military campaigns or orders for executions,<br />\nhe also recalls the women of his<br />\nlife, mostly brief affairs to whom<br />\nhe pledged his undying love.<br />\nChief among the women in his<br />\nlife is Manuela Saenz, the bold<br />\nQuitena, who becomes one of the<br />\nfew people the General trusts<br />\nthroughout his life.

In this book, we see<br />\nhim play cards and get frustrated<br />\nbecause he is losing. Colonel<br />\nWilson, who is beating him, is<br />\nordered to lose but the General<br />\nrealizes this and gets up from the<br />\ntable saying, \"you don't have to<br />\ndo it so badly.\" He is not always<br />\ntemperamental, however. When<br />\nhe hears the beautiful voice of<br />\nIturbide, he joins him, teaching<br />\nhim the songs he was too young<br />\nto know. Cleansing their souls,<br />\nthe two of them spend the night<br />\nsinging together.<br />\nAlthough Bolivar is the last to<br />\nbelieve in his imminent death, he<br /><br />\nchaos.<br />\nWith such great neurotics, it's<br />\ndifficult to say who the standouts<br />\nare. Certainly Lyle Roberts' Axel<br />\nis one of them; almost every line<br />\nhe delivers is a sarcastic put-down<br />\nor a sneer. Quite a few of his lines<br />\nfell flat, but overall he gets the<br />\nmost laughs. Some of his<br />\nmemorable moments include the<br />\nspeeches to his \"friend\" Jack<br />\nDaniels and the pagan rituals<br />\n(\"pork dancers\") he initiates to<br />\nscare off the nerd.<br />\nFreshman David Savolaine as<br /><br />\nticult in the cast. Making putty<br />\nfaces and characterizations is easy<br />\ncompared to presenting the audience with a protagonist they can<br />\nempathize with. Cesari falls<br />\nsomewhat short of this, although<br />\nit's difficult to tell whether the<br />\nfault is in his acting or in the<br />\nscript. He does a good job in the<br />\nfirst act as the mild businessman;<br />\nbut when he starts breaking<br />\nglasses and stomping around after<br />\nthe intermission, you wonder<br />\nwhere he got all that energy. It's<br />\nas if all the development in<br /><br />\ncoNvENIENCE SroRE cLEKtc...<br />\nIi's Nor THE Guy Ntsr TO You IN PHYSICS...<br /><br />\nIT'S<br /><br />\nOF<br /><br />\nUpon seeing the preview for<br />\nListen Up: The Lives of Quincy<br />\nJones, many weeks ago, the immediate thought that jumped to<br />\nmind was \"who would possibly<br />\nwant to see a self-aggrandizing<br />\nyahoo of a film about the man<br />\nbehind Michael Jackson whose<br />\nonly discernible flaw seemed to<br />\nbe his bad judgment in making<br />\nthis movie?\" Turns out I was<br />\nwrong on both counts. This is not<br />\na glorified rockumentary that puts<br />\nQuincy Jones on an Olympic<br />\npedestal, nor did he have any part<br />\nin its production or direction. He<br />\nis simply the worthy apple of someone's eye. As his life and work<br />\nare lovingly recounted, one cannot shake the sense that this film<br /><br />\nis not just a potrayal but a labor<br />\nof love.<br />\nThe unexpected fast pace of sequences keeps the energy pumping, a thankful shift from other<br />\nplodding documentaries. Sonic<br />\nsequences are even overlapped so<br />\nthat people are talking over<br />\nanother. Incredibly there are no<br />\njangled or lost words. Rather, the<br />\neffect is the verbal background<br />\nmusic, the timbre of two or three<br />\nvoices setting the mood for the<br />\nnext sequence. The music that<br />\npulses through the video<br />\nsegments ranges from Jazz<br />\n(Birdland) to early pop (This is<br />\nMy Party) to soul to rap. One of<br />\nthe more amusing parts has a certain famed rapper being utterly<br />\namazed at the intensity of the<br />\nFrench towards rap music. Ap-<br /><br />\nparently, the French intellectualize and analyze each word,<br />\ntreating it with all the.seriousness<br />\nand solemnity they would bring<br />\nto opera.<br />\nAlthough the movie treks from<br />\nboyhood poverty to the realization of young dreams, the story<br />\nis not the standard rags to riches.<br />\nThis film is Quincy Jones as artist, as activist, as philosopher, as<br />\nwell as self-made man. Wellplaced interviews and clips of<br />\nmovies and videos are impressive<br />\nfor their complete lack of<br />\npretense. This makes them<br />\nengagingly real. This also makes<br />\nfor more affecting reception of<br />\nthe staggering amount of impressions that the film flashes in<br />\nalmost two hours.<br /><br />\nARE YOU CONCERNED THAT YOU MIGHT<br />\nNOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT YOURSELF IN<br />\nAN ATTACK?<br />\nDO YOU EVER FEEL VULNERABLE?<br />\nDO YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SIMPLE<br />\nSAFETY MEASURES?<br />\nIF THE ANSWER TO ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS IS YES,<br />\nCOME TO THE TWO-PART<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nITS THE 3oL47<br /><br />\nNEw FAc:<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nnerd Steadman is just as engaging. Steadman's character has<br />\nbeen calculated so that all stops<br />\ncan be pulled loose, and<br />\nSavolaine takes him to the furthest extreme that he can. It's<br />\namazing how scrawny and dopey<br />\nhe manages to make himself, and<br />\nthe whine he delivers his lines<br />\nwith is terrific.<br />\nProbably the most consistent of<br />\nthe laugh-makers are the husband<br />\nand wife team of \"Ticky\" and<br />\nClelia Waldgrave (Gregory P.<br />\nSheahan and Sarah Morton).<br />\n\"Ticky,\" a Dukakis look-alike<br />\nwith a Nixon personality, is the<br />\nplay's scapegoat.

The choppy,<br />\nsimple, folky punk songs by<br />\nwhich the Lemonheads have<br />\ncome to be identified requires<br />\nquite a bit of attention and energy<br />\nto perform successfully, neither<br />\nof which the band possessed at<br />\nthis particular show. The bassist<br />\nand drummer, whom Dando failed to identify on stage, were both<br />\nskilled and sharp, but none of the<br /><br />\nthree was locking in properly<br />\nwith the others, leaving the total<br />\neffect a punk rock mess.<br />\nLemonheads albums are sloppy<br />\nbut together. This was merely<br />\nsloppy.<br />\nDando also failed to communicate with the audience during the performance; even the<br />\ndrummer (who seemed like he<br />\nwas just sitting in for the evening considering Dando's<br />\nheadstrong attitude), was trying<br />\nto talk it up with the crowd while<br />\nDando shouted at the soundman<br />\nand tried to fix his effect pedals.<br />\nDando's rough, slurred voice<br />\nseemed distant and detached,<br />\nstuck within his songs rather than<br />\nprojecting to the audience. He only seemed to return from his personal headspace after the show,<br />\nwhen he apologized to the fans<br />\nwho hung around and spoke with<br />\na few students, bumming cigarettes and asking about clubs in the<br />\narea where he mightplay on his<br />\nnext trip to Baltimore.<br />\nOnly a few times did the show<br />\nseem to take a turn for the bet-<br /><br />\nQuincy Jones' Career<br />\nRecounted In Film<br />\nContinued from page 7<br />\nThe only annoying aspect of<br />\nthe movie is that it almost seems<br />\nto harbor a message within it.<br />\nWhen the subject matter deals<br />\nwith an inspiring spirit such as<br />\nMr. Jones, it becomes ridiculously easy to attach a weighty<br />\nsignificance to what may be<br />\nloosely termed his shining example. There are many opportunites<br />\nto idolize the man because the<br />\ngritty details and drudgery are too<br />\nquickly glossed. His series of failed marriages, his professional<br />\ncrises, all are painted in moody<br />\nblue instead of in shades of<br />\nrealistic gray, so that our sympathy is like a tune played on<br />\nreluctant heartstrings.<br /><br />\nPossibly the music of this film,<br />\nmore clearly defines the message<br />\nin an acceptably universal way<br />\nmore than the wordy interviews.<br />\nAs Jones himself says, music is<br />\na strange animal; it is a better<br />\ncommunicator in times of turmoil<br />\nand political stress than anything<br />\nelse because no one can stop the<br />\nmusic from coming in one's<br />\nheart. Music is Quincy Jones'<br />\nphilosophy. It can take anger that<br />\nhas sprung from pain and redirect<br />\nit into love. It is all about thwarting violence and nurturing<br />\npeaceful community. But the<br />\nquestion remains if this is the<br />\nmessage, why did they hide it<br />\nbehind the image of Mr. Jones?<br /><br />\nArts Calendar<br />\nFILM<br /><br />\nter. \"Ride With Mc\" began as a<br />\nDando solo piece for electric<br />\nguitar, building slowly with kick<br />\ndrum and bass to a full band arrangement. The opener,<br />\n\"Stove,\" held together admirably<br />\nconsidering the drum monitors<br />\nwere off, and the arrival of a<br />\nmysterious fourth member\u2014a<br />\nbourbon-stained guy who looked<br />\nlike Shane MacGowan and<br />\nhollered during the introduction<br />\nof \"Ballarat\"\u2014seemed to charge<br />\nthe performance some more. But<br />\nthe rest of the show seemed<br />\nweaker, an off-night for a band<br />\nthat can do better.<br />\nI felt bad for Jawbox, the opening act, whose crushing fortyminute set was as precise and<br />\nloud as ever. The problem was<br />\nthat only about twenty or thirty<br />\nfans saw their set. \"Hello,<br />\nurn . . Baltimore,\" was the<br />\ngreeting from the trio's singer and<br />\nguitarist, who later asked if any<br />\nHopkins students were actually<br />\npresent.<br />\nIn contrast with Dando's safe<br />\ndistance from the audience, the<br />\nmembers of Jawbox were right in<br />\nthere, even jumping over the<br />\nfoldback monitor amps and falling into the 'crowd,' most of<br />\nwhom were apparently people the<br />\nband knew or had seen before at<br />\ntheir regular D.C. gigs. Their<br />\nblasting post-hardcore mix of<br />\ntough rhythms and odd changes<br />\nand turns was tightly executed<br />\nand well-rehearsed without<br />\nsacrificing<br />\nany<br />\nyouthful<br />\nenthusiasm.<br />\nJawbox was entirely stronger<br />\ndisappointing<br />\nthe<br />\nthan<br />\nperformance,<br />\nand<br />\nLemonheads<br />\nthat<br />\nargue<br />\nwould<br />\none<br />\nno<br />\nthough<br />\nthis was representative of an<br />\naverage Lemonheads show, it<br />\nwas a disconcerting reminder that<br />\na good band has its weaker<br />\nnights.

Principe noted that many of Boyle's<br />\npapers contained recipes for<br />\nalchemy and codes used by Boyle<br />\nin recording his work.<br />\nlAlchemists were interested in the<br />\nconversion or transformation of<br />\n\"baser\" metals (i.e. lead, iron)<br />\ninto gold.] \"The lesson for<br />\nmodern scholars,\" Dr. Principe<br />\nsaid, \"is that almost none of the<br />\nrecords left to us by alchemists<br />\ncan he read at face value. When<br />\nan alchemist writes of mercury or<br />\nsulfur, he may mean hundreds of<br />\ndifferent things. The same author<br />\nmay use the same word in the<br />\nsame text and mean many different things by it, which can only<br />\nhe identified by studying the context.\"<br />\n\"One of my goals,\" Dr. Principe said, \"is to demonstrate the<br />\nImportance of alchemy to the<br /><br />\nhistory of science and to show<br />\nthat alchemy cannot be dismissed out of hand as a worthless and<br />\npast endeavor, simply because the<br />\nalchemist had a world view different from our own.\"<br />\nOnly recently have historians<br />\nrealized the significance of<br />\nalchemy and its close connection<br />\nwith the development of<br />\nchemistry. Apart from their practical search for methods of<br />\ntransforming metals, and for elixirs of youth and prolonged life,<br />\nthese \"scientists\" had solid<br />\ntheories and actually conducted<br />\nexperiments to test their<br />\nhypotheses.<br />\nDuring the late Medieval and<br />\nRenaissance period, alchemy was<br />\nwidely practiced in the Western<br />\nWorld. Many alchemists did not<br />\nwish to reveal their trade secrets,<br />\nand to preserve the esoteric nature<br />\nof thier practices, they devised<br />\nmany concealing, symbolic<br />\nnames for the used materials.<br />\nThis secrecy prevented many<br />\nhistorians from understanding the<br />\nimportance of their study, which<br />\nmany glossed over as mystical<br /><br />\nallegory.<br />\nDr. Principe's current research<br />\nfocuses on Robert Boyle, an<br />\nEnglish natural philosopher who<br />\nlived from 1627 to 1691. Boyle,<br />\nas Principe explains, was interested in the transformation of<br />\nmatter, but more specifically in<br />\nthe making of gold. Boyle's pursuit was strictly for scientific purposes. Principe explains that<br />\nBoyle's work delved into<br />\nspiritualism. According to Principe, Boyle believed that a close<br />\nadherence to the mechanical<br />\nphilosophy of atomism, in which<br />\nall actions are explained<br />\nmechanistically, would lead to<br />\natheism. Boyle wanted to show<br />\nthat there were spiritual forces<br />\nbeyond the mechanist world, proving that there is a god.<br />\nApart from the chemical<br />\naspects, the science of alchemy<br />\nstrove to link the natural and<br />\nsupernatural worlds. These scientists or natural philosophers were<br />\ninterested in the improvement of<br />\nthe human soul and the entire<br />\nhuman race, from the fall of man<br />\nto the reunification of man with<br /><br />\nToo much thyme on your<br />\nhands?

We had lunch<br />\ntogether and she let me record<br />\npart ofour conversation. This is<br />\nYumi's story:<br />\n\"<br />\nI was born in Kyoto prefixure in a town called Miyazu, facing the Japan Sea, and I lived in<br />\nthis town until I was twelve years<br />\nold. 1 had a Japanese name,<br />\nUeno, which I used up to the age<br />\nof twenty. When I entered junior<br />\nhigh school my family moved to<br />\nKyoto city. Before that I never<br />\nexperienced any discrimination as<br />\na Korean. In my new school, I<br />\nstarted to feel uneasy because I<br />\nstarted to hear the negative<br />\nwords.<br />\nWhat were some ofthe negative<br />\nwords?<br />\nIn school, children say Chosenjin [Korean] in a negative way,<br />\nlike Chosenjin is a word to<br />\nthreaten people. My friends at<br />\nschool just said Chosenjin to cut<br />\ndown anything they didn't like.<br />\n1 started to feel uneasy. I knew<br />\nI was different but I didn't know<br />\nI was Korean, I just thought<br />\nmaybe my family was not<br />\nJapanese. I entered high school<br />\nand the situation got more severe.<br />\n.1 was feeling smaller and smaller.<br />\nI was afraid to be found out that<br />\nI was Korean.<br />\nAfter I graduated from high<br />\nschool I wanted to go to college<br />\nto become a physical education<br />\nteacher but discouragingly, I<br />\nfound out Korean people can't be<br />\nteachers.<br />\nHow come? Who told you<br />\nthis)?<br />\nI was talking about my future<br />\nwith my sister and she said I<br />\ncouldn't be a teacher because of<br />\nmy nationality. I found out that<br />\nno Koreans are hired.<br />\nI didn't know what to do. I<br />\ngraduated and I didn't know<br />\nwhere to go. I met two American<br />\npeople in the street downtown and<br />\nI wanted to help them because<br /><br />\nthey seemed to be lost. I helped<br />\nthem with broken, broken<br />\nEnglish and I found out it's great<br />\nto get to know other people from<br />\nother countries.<br />\nI entered a junior college in<br />\nKyoto where I majored in<br />\nEnglish. I met teachers with<br />\nwhom I could speak out to on<br />\nhow I was feeling, how the situation is awful for Korean people.<br />\nYou could speak out toforeign<br />\npeople?<br /><br />\nname and went on to cal! other<br />\nstudents' names and during that<br />\ntime I was thinking what should<br />\nI do, that I shouldn't lose this<br />\nchance, and I raised my hand and<br />\nsaid, 'Miss Crawford, my name<br />\nis not Ueno, so you can call me<br />\nLee from today.' And that was<br />\nthe starting point of where I am<br />\nright now.<br />\nI was quite afraid of the reactions of my classmates. After<br />\nclass my friends and other<br /><br />\nRunning a racism<br />\nThe Japanese government condones discrimination against Koreans.<br />\nOnly in college. When I was a<br />\nsecond year student I went to the<br />\nStates for the first time; it was a<br />\nhomestay program. On my<br />\npassport my name is Yumi Lee.<br />\nso I used the name Yumi Lee,<br />\nwhich was unfamiliar to use. I felt<br />\nlike a different person or<br />\nsomething. I remember I was living with an American family and<br />\nthey had no prejudice; they didn't<br />\ncare if I was Japanese or Korean.<br />\nI felt so free and great, and back<br />\nin Japan I told my emotions to my<br />\nprofessor in college. I was telling her how I felt in the States and<br />\nwhat's wrong with Japanese<br />\nsociety and how I felt in Japan<br />\nand she understood.<br />\nIn the classroom she was calling the students' names, all<br />\nJapanese names, and she stopped<br />\nin front of my name.

I came back last<br />\nSeptember and I read many,<br />\nmany books and journals that<br />\ncover the history of how Japan invaded Korea and how Korean<br />\npeople came over here. It was a<br />\nrealization of why I'm here.<br />\nLooking back to my grandparents' period, I found out the<br />\nhistory of what Japan did that we<br />\nnever learned in school.<br />\nWhat did they tell you in<br />\nschool?<br />\nSince Japanese history is so<br />\n'long, 3000 years, by the time we<br />\nreach recent history, school is<br />\nover.

It's just<br />\ninsane, it's like Germany, and I<br />\ndidn't like to be emotional, but I<br />\nwanted to know what made people do that. And after people<br />\nmake a mistake, what should be<br />\ndone compensation-wise? And<br />\nthat is what I've been doing.<br />\nWhat is the main issue you're<br />\nfighting now?<br />\nA real oppressing thing is<br />\nfingerprinting. You have to carry<br />\na registration card when you<br />\nbecom sixteen years old.<br />\nDo all Japanese carry the<br />\nregistration card orjust Koreans?<br />\nAll foreign people.

My objection is<br />\nthat fingerprinting is wrong as<br />\nidentification because identification for Japanese people is just<br />\nlike a driver's license. This law<br />\nis meant to control Korean people and treat Korean people as<br />\npotential criminals.<br />\nWhy?

So<br />\nteachers are desperate to get to<br />\nknow what's going on in their<br />\nown country. I talk to kids, I talk<br />\nto teachers and I tell them how I<br />\nfelt in school and what should be<br />\ndone now. I used to think this was<br />\nto save suffering of Korean people, but now I think it's for<br />\nJapanese society. Japan is such a<br />\nfamous economic country, they<br />\nneed to also have to deal with the<br />\nworld on a more human level. If<br />\nJapan allows this kind of program, they are not liberating<br />\nthemselves.

With Frank<br />\nGangemi in street clothes and<br />\nScott Cade leaving the game in<br />\nthe second quarter with bruised<br />\nligaments on the knuckles of his<br />\nthrowing hand, the Jays played an<br />\ninspired game. The defense stopped two Dickinson scoring attempts in the final three minutes<br />\nto preserve the tie, on the frozen<br />\ntundra of Homewood Field. The<br />\ntie left Hopkins with a 3-4-1<br />\nrecord and a clear indication that<br />\nthe program has turned the<br />\ncorner.<br />\n\"I think we made a statement<br />\nto them that we can play ball,\"<br />\nsaid John Guglielmo. \"We would<br />\nhave liked to have won, but I<br />\nthink Dickinson knew we beat<br />\nthem.

The loss of Frank<br />\nGangemi to a knee injury added<br />\nenormous pressure to the defense.<br />\nWithout their top lineman, or<br />\nstrong safety Tom Baugher, who<br />\nwas suffering neck burners,<br />\nHopkins needed a great performance from their defensive line.<br />\nThanks to Dave Erfle, this goal<br />\nwas met. Erfle gave one of the<br />\nbest individual performances of<br />\nthe year from his defensive tackle<br />\nposition. He recorded seventeen<br />\ntackles and forced the Dickinson<br />\nline into numerous holding<br />\npenalties.<br />\n\"We played some very fine<br />\ndefense,\" said Jim Margraff.<br />\n\"To play the way we did without<br />\nGangemi or Baugher, we are<br />\nreally pleased. Dave (Erfle) was<br />\nfantastic. You rarely see a defensive lineman play a football game<br />\nlike that.\" One other player worthy of note was linebacker Brian<br />\nCooke. Gangemi's knee injury<br />\nforced Cooke to play defensive<br />\nline for the first time in his career.<br />\nThe crash course in defensive line<br />\nplay payed huge benefits as<br />\nCooke made seven tackles, with<br />\na number of them coming late in<br />\nthe ball game.<br />\n\"Brian did a super job,\" said<br />\nMargraff. \"He had never played<br />\ndefensive line before. In the<br />\npregame he didn't even line up in<br />\na three point stance. He lined up<br />\nin a two point stance at tackle.\"<br />\nBoth teams appeared sluggish<br />\nin the opening minutes, before the<br /><br />\nJays received the first break of the<br />\ngame. Lou Angelos' punt from<br />\nmidfield was fumbled and<br />\nrecovered by Blue Jay freshman<br />\nStephen Murphy on Dickinson's<br />\n26 yard line.

It was a beautiful run that<br />\nincluded a series of shake-andbake moves. Guglielmo found<br />\nFerrari again on a short out pattern that the running back took 49<br />\nyards for the touchdown. It was<br />\na nifty play, because Ferreri<br />\nused Joe Richards as a screen<br />\nalong the sidelines. Once he<br />\ncaught the ball, Ferreri made a<br />\nright turn at Richards' shoulder,<br />\nwho blocked the late arriving<br />\ndefender, and scampered up the<br />\nsidelines for the score. Trotta's<br />\nextra point gave the Jays a 7-0<br />\nlead.<br />\nThe half ended without any further scoring.

By winning the MAC<br />\nSouthwest title, advancing to the<br />\nconference finals for the first time<br />\never, and ranking 16th in the final<br />\nDivision III poll, Hopkins earned a spot in the NCAA Division<br />\nIII Tournament. The Blue Jays<br />\nwill make their first appearance<br />\nin the NCAA tournament Friday,<br />\nNovember 2 in a rematch against<br />\nMessiah, the Division III second<br />\nranked team.<br />\nOn Saturday, October 27,<br />\nMessiah defeated the Jays 5-0.<br />\nThe loss was only the Jays' fourth<br />\nof the season. All of their losses<br />\nwere to top fifteen teams.<br />\nSophomore standout goalie, Alec<br />\nKing, recorded twenty-five saves<br />\nduring the contest as Messiah<br />\ncontrolled the ball for most of the<br />\ngame. According to coach Sally<br />\nBeth Anderson, the teams were<br />\nbetter matched than the score<br />\nwould indicate. \"They never<br />\nshould have gotten a 2-0 lead. We<br />\nmade a couple of poor team plays<br />\nand they scored on some flukes,\"<br />\nshe said. The Hopkins defense<br />\nheld Messiah in check during<br />\nsettled play, allowing one goal off<br />\na corner (in thirteen attempts),<br />\nand one on a \"nice pass play.\"<br />\nHopkins started quick as they<br />\ntook the opening ball down the<br />\nfield and fired a shot. However,<br />\nMessiah recovered and sent the<br />\nball to their strong forward line<br />\nwhile the Blue Jays managed only two more shots for the rest of<br />\nthe game. \"They were very fast<br />\nbreaking and had a quick transition. At least we tightened things<br />\nup in the second half,\" Anderson<br />\nadded.<br />\nSenior co-captain Meredith<br />\nBlitz finally returned to action<br />\nafter undergoing arthroscopic<br />\nsurgery several weeks ago.<br />\n\"Meredith played well. It was<br /><br />\nnice to have her back because she<br />\nbrings leadership to the field. she<br />\nalso increases our options. We<br />\nhave more flexibility in positioning players,\" said Anderson.<br />\nAn unfortunate consequence of<br />\nthe NCAA tournament draw is<br />\nthat the Jays must travel to<br />\nMessiah again this week.<br />\nHowever, Anderson is confident<br />\nthat a different Blue Jay team will<br />\nappear in the rematch. \"If we<br />\ncould score early, we could have<br />\na good chance of beating them.<br />\nWe've changed our game plan for<br />\nthis game. We'll be a different<br />\nteam,\" she said. Anderson is<br />\ncounting on King, who has<br />\nallowed only 17 goals in 16<br />\ngames for a 1.02 goals against<br />\naverage, to have another of her<br />\nbig games. The coach is also hoping that Blitz can see more playing time and the team can recover<br />\nfrom the mental. errors that contributed to the championship loss.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins has had 14-2<br />\nrecords (compared to this years<br />\n10-4-2) in the past, they have<br />\nbeen overlooked by the NCAA<br />\nTournament Selection Committee. Anderson attributes this<br />\nyear's selection to the strength of<br />\nthe Hopkins schedule and her<br />\nteam's excellent play in tough<br />\nmatches. Three Hopkins foes<br />\nwere also invited to the tournament. Additionally, three more<br />\nplayed in the conference tournament. \"It's great that we got past<br />\nHaverford in the MACs. We've<br />\nalready reached my goal of making the NCAAs from among<br />\nnearly 150 teams,\" concluded<br />\nAnderson.<br />\nIf past performance means<br />\nanything, Hopkins can expect a<br />\nbetter game this week. Hopkins<br />\nlost to Bloomsburg 2-0 while<br />\nBloomsburg defeated Messiah<br />\n2-1 during the regular season.<br />\nAdditionally, the Blue Jays can<br />\nhope Messiah will look beyond<br />\nHopkins to a potential quarterfinal matchup.<br /><br />\nBill Berger<br /><br />\nHead coach Sally Beth Anderson is pleased with the team's NCAA bid.<br /><br />\n14/NOVEMBER 2, 1990<br /><br />\nHolyfield KO's Orca<br />\nwould not last the full twelve,<br />\nrounds, and he had to get to<br />\nHolyfield's weaknesses, his<br />\ndefense and susceptibility to<br />\nbeing hit.

In the game against AU,<br />\nHopkins played the first half<br />\nwhile down by 3 players, whose<br />\ncar had gotten lost. Hopkins<br />\nmade up for this handicap by<br />\nhustling around the field and<br />\nholding American to just four<br />\ntries in the first half. Unfortunately, that was enough.

I.<br />\nbuttressed by my virulent commitment to reader education and<br />\na new stack of \"Shape\"<br />\nmagazines (rumored to be filled<br />\nwith some wacky injuries), intend<br />\nto extend IOTW to it's unfunny<br />\ndemise.<br />\nThis renewal, however, is not<br />\nonly a product of my singular<br />\ndesire to see \"injury\" extended<br />\n(or hyper-extended) to its most<br />\npainful length. Instead, I must<br />\ngive credit where credit is due.<br />\n101W typist and universal friend<br />\nof the borderline humorous,<br />\nTierney \"I've fallen and I can't<br />\nget up\" Sherwin, first inspired<br />\nme to resurrect \"Injury.\" Next,<br />\nthe New York Jets coach Bruce<br />\nCoslet stated that wide receiver<br />\nAl Toon had been \"playing with<br />\na broken back,\" and while<br />\nthe condition was not career<br />\nthreatening, it had affected his onfield performance. Coach<br />\nCoslet's been spewing exactly the<br />\nkind of disinformation which<br />\nkeeps IOTW alive and kicking<br />\n(and since the Jets beat the Oilers<br />\nhe can spew whatever he wants).<br />\nToon actually had a fractured<br />\nvertebra. He is no longer risk in<br /><br />\nparalysis, and is not playing as a<br />\nmember of the proverbial \"walking wounded.\" Finally, I'd like<br />\nto thank the 101W fans who<br />\nmentioned that they liked the column, or gave me the ultimate<br />\ncompliment: \"Yeah, I think I had<br />\nthat.\"<br />\nEnough fluff; I know you want<br />\nthe pure science that made this<br />\ncolumn famous. Consider the hip<br />\npointer; certainly it is among the<br />\nmost inane sounding of sports injuries. Questions rush to one's<br />\nhead. What is it? What does it<br />\npoint to? Here's the dirt: you<br />\nmight think two different injuries<br />\nare a hip pointer.'The first, a contusion (bruise) of the great<br />\ntrochanter of the femur (hip bone)<br />\nis the true culprit. This painful<br />\nbruising of the bony protruberance in one's hip, is not a<br />\ncommon injury for athletes who<br />\nhave developed thigh muscles<br />\n(although most hacks who have<br />\ntaken a tumble on the turf have<br />\nprobably experienced this). The<br />\npseudo-hip pointer, that pointy<br />\npelvic condition, is a contusion of<br />\nthe crest of the ilium. This is<br />\nmore common, and can occur<br />\ndespite developed thigh muscles<br />\nand thorough padding. I'm happy, hope you're all happy too; a<br />\nmystery has been solved.

The Jays won fifteen<br />\nout of their last 17 matches to<br />\nfinish with a 20-7 record.<br />\nHowever, it was not enough to<br />\nearn a bid in the post-season<br />\ntournament.<br />\nDespite their strong overall<br />\nrecord, the Jays only won two of<br />\ntheir five intradivisional contests,<br />\nleaving them fourth in the MAC<br />\nSouthwest and devoid of postseason life. The top four division<br />\nwinners in the MAC receive<br />\nautomatic berths, and six \"atlarge\" bids are given out.<br />\nHopkins had posted wins over the<br />\ntop two teams in the MAC Northeast, but having a bevy of<br />\npowerful schools in their own<br />\ndivision\u2014Western Maryland,<br />\nGettysburg, and Dickinson\u2014<br />\nproved too big an obstacle to<br />\novercome.<br /><br />\nBill Berger<br /><br />\nOmar Nicholson tries to outleap<br />\nWashington College player in 2-0<br />\nvictory that landed the team in a<br />\nthree-way tie for first place in<br />\nMAC Southeast.

Hopkins found itself<br />\nin a 13-13 tie in the first game,<br /><br />\nhowever, but escaped with a<br />\n16-14 victory. They were never<br />\nseriously threatened after that.<br />\n\"We had beaten all those teams<br />\nbefore, so we knew that if we<br />\nplayed the way we were capable<br />\nof playing we would win,\" said<br />\nhead coach Bill Jones.<br /><br />\nThe Jays played Upsala on<br />\nMoilday in a make-up match, and<br />\ncame away with a 15-5, 16-4,<br />\n17-15 win. In the second game,<br />\nHopkins dug itself a hole, falling<br />\nbehind 11-3. The team was not<br />\ncommunicating well and appeared flustered. Jones called a<br /><br />\nThe women's volleyball team had many reasons to smile this season.<br /><br />\ntimeout, and the team gathered<br />\nthemselves and came back to take<br />\na 15-14 lead. After trading<br />\nseveral side-outs, the Jays were<br />\nfinally able to complete the comeback. Upsala had finished<br />\nsecond in the MAC Northeast,<br />\nbut was unable to end the Jays<br />\nseason-long nine game home winning streak.<br />\nJones was very pleased with the<br />\nteam's performance on the year.<br />\n\"We've gotten better all season,\"<br />\nhe said. \"At the start of the<br />\nseason, we were averaging seven<br />\nkills a game. Now we're averaging eleven, which means we increased the efficiency of our attack by more than 50 percent.\"<br />\nJones pointed to the team's improved offense as the difference<br />\nbetween this year's and last year's<br />\nsquad. \"The big thing we did this<br />\nseason was attack.\" Jones<br />\npointed to Firouzeh Bahrampour,<br />\nSuzy Yoon, Trang Pham and Jennifer Kishimori as a few of the<br />\nplayers who improved their offensive games. \"All of the other<br />\nplayers really contributed,\" Jones<br />\nsaid.<br />\nWith twenty wins, Jones and<br />\nthe team can look ahead to next<br />\nyear with confidence. The Jays<br />\nwill not lose any players to<br />\ngraduation. \"Our goal is to get<br />\nan at-large bid,\" Jones said.<br />\n\"Our focus is going to be Dickinson.

I don't want to spend nights<br />\nwaking up in a cold sweat.<br />\nMore to the point.
