Eisenhower Symposium, the<br />\nSpring Fair organization and the<br />\nWomen's Center.<br />\nThese campus groups, which<br />\nalong with the Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization were<br />\nfound to have valid needs for<br />\nspace to conduct business, have<br />\nbeen given other offices under a<br />\nplan which Director of Student<br />\nServices Albert (Tom)Schmith<br />\nthinks will satisfy all parties<br />\nconcern .\"At least, we haven't<br />\nhad anybody complaining yet,\"<br />\nSchmith commented.<br />\nThe plan leaves the second<br />\nfloor as it was, with the Little<br />\nTheater reserved for alternate use<br />\nas a conference room when other<br />\nconference rooms are full.<br />\nGroups presently using the<br />\nsecond floor include the tutoring<br />\ncommittee, Chester's Place, the<br />\nStudent Council, Bob Arellano's<br />\nplaywriting classes, a recently<br />\nformed music co-op, and the<br />\nWriting Seminars' poetry and<br />\nprose readings.<br />\nThe G.R.O. also stays where it<br />\nis, in one corner of the Student<br />\nActivities Commission office. A<br />\nnew room, however, has been<br />\nbuilt in an adjacent corner of the<br />\noffice to accomodate the Spring<br />\nFair committee and the<br />\nEisenhower Symposium. The<br />\nChaplain's Office donated an<br />\noffice in Merryman Hall for the<br />\nWomen's Center. \"Our<br />\n<br />\nphilosophy was that students<br />\nshould accomodate students,\"<br />\nexplained Schmith. \"Everybody<br />\ngave a little...It was a community<br />\neffort.\"<br />\nThe suggestion to divert the<br />\nsecond floor to office space was<br />\nfirst advanced in a survey made<br />\nby Director of Student Activities<br />\nChris Colombo in order to find<br />\nspace for the previously<br />\nmentioned groups--especially for<br />\nthe Spring Fair committee, which<br />\nis already gearing up for Hopkins'<br />\nannual carnival. Protest was loud<br />\nand immediate. A petition<br />\ncirculated by the groups involved<br />\npicked up approximately 700<br />\nsignatures in three days.<br />\nDavid Fishkin, who heads the<br />\nChaplain's Tutoring office, was a<br />\nleader in the protest. \"We made<br />\nit very clear to Colonel Schmith<br />\nthat we needed the space,\" said<br />\nFishkin. \"It (Chester's Place) has<br />\nbecome a tradition. It's the only<br />\nsmall theater on campus, and<br />\ncombined with the muraled<br />\nroom, there's no other place like<br />\nit.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the<br />\npetition, Schmith said, \"The<br />\nsignatures didn't matter. We<br />\ntalked to Bob Arellano and<br />\nChaplain Wickwire. We asked the<br />\nUnion Board and Student<br />\nCouncil for recommendations.<br />\nEverybody said to keep the Little<br />\nTheater. Of course we took that<br />\ninto consideration, but we also<br />\nwanted the most efficient use of<br />\nspace and monies.

The raccoons<br />\nhad company; freshmen have<br />\ncomplained of huge rats in the<br />\ndormitory area. Admitted<br />\nPresident Steven Muller, \"I did<br />\nnotice several rodents gambolling<br />\naround and...I understand the<br />\nproblem has gotten worse with<br />\nthe construction of Mudd Hall,<br />\nwhich may have disturbed, on<br />\none hand, their natural habitats<br />\nout of sight and, on the other<br />\nhand, probably created, with<br />\nworkmen leaving...debris, created<br />\na more attractive environment<br />\nfor them to scavenge in...The<br />\nreason we have the problem<br />\naround Mudd Hall is because the<br />\npeople who have been working<br />\non that building eat their lunch<br />\naround there...and they leave<br />\ngarbage.\"<br />\n\"I understand the building is<br />\nbuilt like a bomb shelter,\" hinted<br />\nPieget, but contrary to rumor,<br />\nMudd Hall is not a secret missile<br />\nsilo for the APL.

Campbell<br />\nexpects this terraced Bufano<br />\nsculpture garden to be finished<br />\nby the end of the summer.

Within the space of a year,<br />\nshe became administrative assistant, acting and then<br />\npermanent Housings Director. Certainly, her rise was<br />\noccasioned more by good fortune than by any 'outstanding<br />\nbrilliance she displayed. But this in no way detracts from<br />\nthe record .she compiled during her tenure. All in all, she<br />\nperformed very creditably.<br />\nChief among the innovations for which she was<br />\nresponsible is the new housing lottery through which all<br />\nspaces were made available to both undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate students. This system, worked so well that in<br />\nseveral categories of apartment spaces every student who<br />\nentered the lottery eventually received an option on some<br />\ntype of University accomodation. The new method is much<br />\nfairer than the old way when graduate students were given a<br />\npreference and undergraduates could only slip in through<br />\nthe back door.<br />\nThe recent departures of Umran and of Martha Grimm<br />\nhave left a noticeable vacuum. Her temporarysuccessor, in a<br />\npart-time role, will doubtless do her best, but a full-time<br />\nDirector is needed. The University in the past has placed<br />\npitifully little emphasis on the directorship within its<br />\nbureaucratic hierarchy. But it is a position which directly<br />\naffects a large number of students, and a serious effort<br />\nshould be made to replace Uras as soon as possible.<br />\n<br />\nNo Clean Sweep<br />\nWith its noncommittal response to the student outcry<br />\nover the treatment received by the janitorial staff in the<br />\nDepartment of Housekeeping, Richard Zdanis and the<br />\nadministration have in effect washed their hands of the<br />\nmatter.<br />\nThey are still far from clean, however. The janitors<br />\nremain u-nhappy, and the student unrest continues,.<br />\nsharpened by the tactic the administration adopted of<br />\nletting the matter die over the semester break. Its repeated<br />\nrefusal to meet with concerned students and union leaders<br />\nat one time is further evidence of a lack of good faith in<br />\nresolving the problem.<br />\nThe Office of Plant Planning has done its best to sweep<br />\nthe _janitors and their grievances under the rug.

I am<br />\nspeaking, of course, of the<br />\nappalling lack of consideration<br />\nafforded the Hillbilly students in<br />\nattendance at this University.<br />\nAlthough a small and taciturn<br />\nminority here, the faction of the<br />\nstudent body which calls the<br />\nsouthern portion of the<br />\nAppalachian mountain chain<br />\ntheir home are conspicuously<br />\noverlooked, it seems to me, by<br />\nthe student council, social<br />\ncommittees, Administration, and<br />\nthe News-Letter itself (an<br />\notherwise impeccable publication). I esteem myself a humble<br />\nmember of this much discriminated against faction. Among my<br />\ninnumerable grievances:<br />\n1. The utter inavailability of<br />\nMoonshine or Home Brew at the<br />\nRat.<br />\n2. The absence of square<br />\ndances and turkey shoots that<br />\nmight be sponsored by Classes of<br />\nthe student government.<br />\n3. The impossibility of<br />\npurchasing chewing tobacco at<br />\nthe Union Desk (the Snuff<br />\ncurrently being sold at the<br />\nbookstore is a nice touch,<br />\nhowever).<br />\n4. The fact that Dixie Dick is<br />\nrelegated to the back pages of the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\n5. That such prestigious<br />\nnational leaders as Howard Baker<br />\nand Robert Byrd are never<br />\ninvited to speak at Symposiums<br />\nfor the painfully obvious reason<br />\nthat they are Hillbillies.<br />\n6. That Lester Maddox pick<br />\naxe handles are nowhere to be<br />\npurchased.<br />\nIt is my sincere hope that in<br />\nenumerating these grievances, the<br />\nglaring inadequacies in the<br />\nUniversity's treatment of<br />\nHillbilly and Mountaineer<br />\nstudents might be rectified.

A<br />\nfew left again to get a drink of<br />\nwater. \"You notice when you<br />\ncome in that everybody starts to<br />\nleave?\" Josh asked a friend who<br />\nhad just arrived. \"Maybe it's a<br />\ndelayed reaction to me,\" he<br />\nreconsidered.<br />\nAt 10 a.m. the teacher<br />\narrived--Ben Reynolds, who last<br />\nyear completed the Writing<br />\nSeminars graduate program.<br />\nYoung, with a moustache and<br />\nlongish hair, he spoke informally<br />\nwith the students.

Apparently, one of the portlier<br />\npatrons in the Versailles Room had decided that<br />\nconsomme would be the perfect cap-off to his dinner,<br />\npronounced that fact loudly to the waiter, and started a<br />\nAs a result,<br />\ngeneral trend among the other tables.<br />\nthe kitchen was flooded with orders for consomme:<br />\nNot beef consomme; not chicken consomme; oh<br />\nno sir! It was to be 'Belgian consomme or nothing for<br />\nthat happy gourmand--and as he went, so went the dining<br />\nroom. My host, a picture of tired annoyance, gave me this<br />\nexplanation as he caught his breath in the hallway. Grimy<br />\nkitchen sweat dripped from a broad and panting face, his<br />\nfloppy chef's hat had fallen in on one side like an<br />\nunfortunate souffle, and his soiled apron resembled a<br />\nVictorian surgeon's gown.<br />\n\"Do you even have any Belgian consomme?\"<br />\ninquired.<br />\n\"We do now. It's gonna taste like the insides of a<br />\nwino's hat, but he'll probably ooh and aah over it like at<br />\nA-rab at Disney World to show his chick what a table de<br />\nhote he is.\"<br />\nAt this point the frowning head of an underling poked<br />\nout from the kitchen door.\"Hey Dale,\" it queried,\"what<br />\nelse goes in this stuff?\"<br />\n\"Hmmm...:et's see...What's something really<br />\nnauseating?\"<br />\n\"Yams?\" I volunteered.<br />\n\"The very thing!\"chuckled my Host, snapping his<br />\nfingers approvingly. Turning back to the still protruding<br />\nhead, he instructed in a solemn and official tone: \"Yes. I<br />\nwant one large, unheated yam floating obscenely in each<br />\nbowl, understood?\" The head dutifully nodded and then<br />\nquickly vanished, leaving me alone with my perspiring<br />\nHost. \"This Belgian Bowl o'Barf is gonna take about<br />\nfifteen minutes. Go ahead into the bar and suck on<br />\nsomething.\"<br />\nAnd so I sat, whisky sour in hand,<br />\nhoping that I stuck out from the gaggle of leisure-suited<br />\ncretins and eagerly awaiting my Host's appearance from<br />\nthe bowels of the kitchen. The Establishment, which,<br />\nupon the frenzied pleadings of the News-Letter legal<br />\ndepartment shall remain nameless, was typical of the<br />\n\"New Elegance\" school of suburban restaurants.Catering<br />\nto two groups of clientele\u2014the Young & Alive and the<br />\nBlond & In Touch\u2014it featured that thoroughly seventies<br />\ncombination of overpriced French cuisine inside and<br />\noverpriced cocaine in the parking lot. Thousands had been<br />\nspent on the bar in a vain attempt to create a cozy,<br />\n\"spontaneous\" atmosphere, and it showed. Not nearly<br />\nenough had been spent in recruiting the roving guitar<br />\nplayer, and it sounded like it. The whisky sours were<br />\nwatered, and tasted like it. But, when you're not quite<br />\ntwenty-one, and look it, you smile nicely at the bartender<br />\nand act absolutely delighted at whatever he deigns to<br />\nserve.<br />\nWhen my Host finally arrived some twenty minutes<br />\nlater, he was a changed man. Gone was every vestment of<br />\nsweaty chelhood, replaced instead by the cool and steady<br />\ndemeanor of his civilian life. We settled down to the usual<br />\nquotas of \"good-to-have-you-backs\" and waited for the<br />\nworld to get friendlier by degrees. It wasn't until halfway<br />\nthrough his second rum & coke that he announced to the<br />\nbartender and myself that he would \"go for the Throne\"<br />\ntonight in my honor.<br />\nA troubled look came into the bartender's eye.<br />\n\"The Throne?\" I asked.<br />\n\"The Throne...\" he solemnly replied \"...of Self Abuse.<br />\nBut first I have to get primed.\"<br />\n\"Priming\" consisted of no less than six rum & cokes, all<br />\nleisurely consumed while we chatted about our recent sex<br />\nlives. (I know for a fact that Dixie Dick's recent sex life<br />\nruns through no less than twenty-one beers, which equals<br />\nout to about fifteen and a half rum & cokes. But that,<br />\nyou miserable lechers, is a throne of a different kind). My<br />\n!lost also informed me as to why the bartender took such<br />\na dim view of the planned proceedings..It seems that the<br />\nworthy gentleman himself was the reigning monarch, and<br />\ndid not like to encourage the aspirations (no matter how<br />\nunlikely I of any Johnny-Walker-come-lately upstart<br />\nusurpers.<br />\nWhen the preliminaries were safely in our stomachs. my<br />\nHost straightened himself on his stool, slapped the bar top<br />\nwith a beefy hand, and announced to whom it may have<br />\nconcerned: \u2014 Now! Down to business! Roy, a<br />\nOne-fifty-one...aflame if you please!\"<br />\nReigning King Roy, mindful of his duty as a barkeep,<br />\nproduced a shot glass tilled to the brim with a clear liquid<br />\nand gently touched a lighted match to its placid surface.<br />\n<br />\nA drama in true life by<br />\n<br />\nCates Baldridge<br />\nBlue flame danced delicately skyward. The ritual Was<br />\nbegun.<br />\nA humble aspirant to the .Throne am I,<br />\nJust a sotted, potted, plastered guy.<br />\nAnd ifI die a commoner still,<br />\nYou can pickle my guts in this filthy swill !!!<br />\n\"Down the hatch!\"<br />\nHis lips pursed for a split second as the flame curled the<br />\nlonger hairs of his moustache into sizzling gobs of protein,<br />\nthen opened to receive the mighty elixir. Up went the<br />\nglass, down went the rum. Friends, he took it like a man.<br />\nNot a peep--not even a moist eye to mark what had passed<br />\nfrom tongue to gullet in a scalding arch.<br />\n\"Wasn't that a little...hot?\"<br />\n\"Indeed it was, which furnishes us with the theme for<br />\nthis assault upon the Throne.\"<br />\n\"I didn't know you had to have a goddamn theme,<br />\ntoo.\"<br />\n\"That's 'cause you weren't raised right. Barkeep!\" Roy<br />\nsauntered over in no particular hurry.\"Roy, my boy, the<br />\ntheme of this evening is going to be heat, and<br />\naccordingly,I will abuse my body with only those drinks<br />\nwhich pertain to that theme. Like for instance...a Mexican<br />\nFlag.\" Roy's interest perked up right away. Apparently<br />\nthere was stomething about that particular libation which<br />\nsuggested that this drinker meant business.<br />\n\"Hey Noosh!\" Roy called out over the bar. \"We got a<br />\nMexican Flag drinker here! Better tie down the<br />\nfurniture!\" Noosh, who appeared to be a somewhat<br />\nhigher level functionary, materialized at my Host's elbow<br />\nalmost immediately, sporting a close cropped beard and a<br />\ntwinkle of demonic delight in his hard, black eyes. He<br />\nlooked amazingly like a young Sigmund Freud.<br />\n\"you goin' for the Throne, Dale?\"<br />\n\"Just so.\"<br />\n\"Never make it.\"<br />\n\"Bullshit. Stick around.\"<br />\nThe Mexican Flag arrived, and a pretty little bugger it<br />\nwas, too. The Cream Denoyce, One-fifty-one, and green<br />\nchartreuse of which it was made had separated into<br />\ndistinct layers of red, white and green respectively--just<br />\nlike the proud banner for which it was named.<br />\n\"Hey, that looks...good. I'll have one too,\" I<br />\nannounced.<br />\n\"You'll be sorry, college boy.\"<br />\n\"No doubt. Set it up, Roy.\" It was to be a double<br />\nshoot. \"After all,\" I thought, as the potion touched my<br />\nnovice lips, \"such a pretty drink couldn't FRY MY<br />\nBRAINAGGGIIHIIIIIIHH! My head whipped back in a<br />\nconvulsive jerk, which was surprising sinces I felt<br />\nreasonably sure that my entire neck had been instantly<br />\nincinerated. Montezuma's Revenge continued its fiery<br />\ndescent, etching \"Yankee Go Home\" on my buckling<br />\nstomach. As I slowly regained composure, Noosh's<br />\ndevilish ,rin floated into view.<br />\n<br />\n\"Hell of a drink, ain't it son? What's next, Dale?\"<br />\n\"I don't know,\" replied my Host, who seemed to have<br />\ntaken his brush with the Grim Reaper rather better than<br />\nthis reporter. \"I've heard about a drink called a Praire<br />\nFire, but I don't know what's in it.\"<br />\nNoosh's demonic grin advanced two notches to pure<br />\nsatanic delight. \"I know.\" The fiend chuckled. \"Be glad<br />\nto make one for ya, Dale.\"<br />\n\"Great.\"<br />\n\"Of course now, it's a shooter. You can't sip this one.\"<br />\nI smelled a rat.<br />\n\"What's in it?\" my Host inquired, apparently receiving<br />\na similar olfactory input.<br />\n\"Tell you what. I'll make it, you drink it, and<br />\nthen you tell /ne what's in it.\"<br />\n\"Well...\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Of course now, it's a shooter. I'm not gonna make it if<br />\nyou're gonna queen around and sip the damn thing.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, but...\"<br />\n\"Hey Dale...you gonna be the new King or what?\"<br />\nMy Host stiffened. \"That's why the hell I'm here, now<br />\nisn't it? Set it up, Noosh. Do your worst.\" Mephistophilis<br />\ndeparted straight away to prepare his witch's brew, and I<br />\nnervously watched as he and Roy bent over a sink at the<br />\nfar end of the bar. As soon as ol Roy saw just what was<br />\ngoing into the Praire Fire, his eyes widened in wonder and<br />\nhe actually backed off a step or two, seemingly for<br />\nprotection. All the while his jaw hung down and his head<br />\nwagged back and forth in foolish amazement. I shuddered<br />\nto think on the heinous concoction that could turn the<br />\nhead of a hardened bartender and reigning King of Self<br />\nAbuse. Noosh was now holding a shot glass in one hand<br />\nand shaking something from a small bottle vigorously into<br />\nit, his beard fairly bristling with fiendish delight.<br />\nHalf a minute later the item was deposited in front of<br />\nmy Host. Small, nasty, and red, it was a drink straight<br />\nfrom the Seventh Circle of Hell.<br />\n\"Remember, Dale, it's a shooter.\"<br />\n<br />\nMy Host looked at it suspiciously, then looked at<br />\nNoosh very suspiciously, then looked around for help.<br />\nThere was none to be had. Quite a crowd had gathered by<br />\nthis time, but they were all bent towards him in twisted<br />\nanticipation, like a mob urging a leaper from the ledge.<br />\nHe shot it alright--but it fired back. The glass came<br />\ndown with a sharp crack, sending silver slivers the length<br />\nof the bar. Fluid gushed from his nose and eyes, dribbled<br />\nfrom his ears. His mouth had compressed itself into an<br />\nugly round dot, and his foot kicked wildly at the<br />\nbaseboards in a vain attempt to distract himself from the<br />\npain. The crowd went wild.<br />\n\"Himmie...wa-er!\" he groaned from behind clenched<br />\nteeth. \"Himmie... wa-er!\" \"Uh, I believe he requires a<br />\nbit of water before he continues.\"<br />\n\"I believe you're right,\" Roy answered. \"One tall,<br />\ndelicious, cool...\"<br />\n\"Get on with it, Roy,\" I threatened.<br />\n\"...water coming up.\" He gave me a dirty look, took a<br />\ntall glass, filled it with cool, delicious gin and pushed it<br />\ntowards my thrashing Host. This was cruelty, and I said<br />\nso. Noosh, apparently worried over the prospect of a<br />\nnegligent homicide rap,reached over the bar and fetched<br />\nout a quart carton of milk, which he quickly placed under<br />\nmy Host's beet-red nose. Five seconds later it was gone.<br />\nWhen my Host finally composed himself, he looked<br />\nrather sternly at the bearded provocateur and calmly<br />\ninformed him: \"You're going to die, Noosh. Yes, yes,<br />\nyou're going to die. Not because of what you did to that<br />\ntwelve-year-old girl last week, not because you were the<br />\narchitect of the Pol Pot regime, not even because you<br />\nsteal our tips. No, my little Nooshy, you're going to die<br />\nbecause you put a lot of Tabasco sauce in that drink.\"<br />\n\"A full fourth to be exact,\" quoted an unperturbed<br />\nNoosh. \"The other three parts were straight vodka. One<br />\nhell of a drink, eh?\" My Host had taken a long time to<br />\ncool off, and the crowd was getting restless as a result.<br />\nThey wanted blood, thrown up or otherwise: The masses<br />\nwere yearning for a new monarch, and suggestions for<br />\nnew and even more bizarre cocktails rang out from their<br />\nranks with bloodthirsty eagerness.<br />\nI had been matching each of my Host's indiscretions<br />\nwith a straight whisky shot of my own (don't forget<br />\nabout the six rum & cokes), so things became a bit<br />\nconfused about this time. Of course I stopped in the<br />\ninterest of responsible journalism, but all that remains for<br />\na while are the names of the subsequent drinks and their<br />\ncontents, which I hastily scrawled on a cocktail napkin.<br />\n(Roy was much more cooperative when I told him his<br />\nname would be in print. He said he'd been meaning to<br />\nsubscribe to Newsweek for years now). Anyhow, the<br />\nCoronation Night proceeded as follows.<br />\nThe Jelly Bean: Tequila, ouzo, and grenadine in a shot<br />\nglass. Looks like a jelly bean. Tastes like a jelly bean.<br />\nWorks like a lobotomy.<br />\nThe Harbour Light: One fifth tequila, Wild Turkey, and<br />\nkahluat This one got away from oh' Roy when he lit it on<br />\nfire. He'd been sloppy in the preparations and as a result<br />\n<br />\n\fke\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nard<br />\n<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\nflames leaped onto the sink and from there to the bar<br />\nwhere two hookers from the Marriot down the street were<br />\nslightly singed. No major damage, but one of the scorched<br />\nwomen loudly informed poor Roy that as far as she was<br />\nconcerned, he had lost his \"bartender's discount\" for the<br />\nrest of fiscal '79.<br />\nThe Gin Go-Blind Cocktail: I can't remember quite<br />\nwhat went into this ghastly item, and it isn't written<br />\ndown anywhere, but it's just as well because I hear it's<br />\nillegal in Maryland anyway. My Host reported that his left<br />\nleg went dead just after drinking it.<br />\nThe Mother Superior: A martini with a prune instead<br />\nof an olive. I swear, it seemed funny as hell at the time.<br />\nThe Root Beer Float: Galliano, kaluha, cocoa, and a<br />\nsplash of coke. Mild and harmless, but the girl who<br />\nsuggested it had the biggest set of kegs in four counties. If<br />\nyou'd seen her, you'd have drunk the damn thing, too.<br />\nThe Long Island Iced Tea: Equal parts vodka, gin, rum,<br />\nand sweet & sour, coke for coloring. This merciless affair<br />\nsneaks up from behind and sits on your face.<br />\nNow came the moment of truth. My Host was on the<br />\nverge of his kingship, as well as the edge of his barstool.<br />\nHe had drunk up a river of booze, fed by a score of<br />\nnoxious streams. Just the thought of all that crap floating<br />\naround in his stomach--sour and sweet, thick and watery,<br />\nencompassing every color in the rainbow, every odor in<br />\nSatan's jockstrap--was enough to make my whisky shots<br />\nbang their cups on my esophagus and clamour for<br />\nimmediate release. I persevered, however,and so u:d my<br />\nHost. Weaving upon hisstool like an impatient<br />\nfour-year-old, spasmodically grabbing at passing breasts,<br />\nhe was the very picture of decadent aristocracy. Wasted,<br />\nblitzed, blighted...the Man Who Would Be King.<br />\nOnly one test remained, and that hoary cupbearer<br />\nNoosh placed it before him with infernal relish. By name:<br />\nYellow Jacket and Green Hornet--the two-headed insect<br />\nwhich guards the entrance to the Royal Apartments of<br />\nSelf Abuse. Abandon all hope, Ye who ingest here.<br />\nYellow Chartreuse with one-fifty-one in the former, green<br />\nChartreuse and the same in the latter. Both to be polished<br />\noff while a coin is being flipped in the air. When the clang<br />\nof metal on the bar is heard, the aspirant is either the new<br />\nKing or the Court Jester, El Supremo or just another<br />\ndrunk who couldn't make the grade.<br />\nHe grabbed the glasses, one in each fist\u2014a latter-day<br />\nArthur with his hams on Excalibur's hilt. All was in<br />\nreadiness. A reverent hush fell over the irreverent crowd.<br />\nNoosh's wrist jerked. The coin sprung upwards,<br />\ndisappearing into the subdued light of the lounge, like a<br />\nmeteor piercing the fog. There was the terrible crashing<br />\nsound of glass on teeth, then another, then a thud as the<br />\nglasses came home,and then...only then, the hollow clang<br />\nof two-bits on linoleum.<br />\n\"God save the King!\" shouted Noosh and I in unison.<br />\n\"GOD SAVE THE KING!\" responded the frenzied<br />\ncitizenry. He had done it--my Host was the Big Enchilada<br />\nThere was<br />\nat last. Pandemonium swept the Palace.<br />\nof his<br />\nslapping<br />\ncheeks,<br />\nmuch kissing of his ruddy<br />\nbuy<br />\n\"Lemmie<br />\nof:<br />\nshouts<br />\nbroad 'back, and idiotic<br />\nSomebody wanted an<br />\nthat man a drink!\"<br />\nautograph and one leisure-suiter started throwing money.<br />\nI am proud to say, however, that despite all the uproar,<br />\nHis Majesty's first words were to me. Dimly aware of how<br />\ndamaged his royal brain really was at this point, he threw<br />\na beefy arm around my shoulder, blew a reeking breath<br />\ninto my face and sighed: \"Tell Mom I loved her.\"<br />\nI believe he wanted to say a bit more, but the affairs of<br />\nState tore him away. There was the customary burning of<br />\nthe tab,and, after that, the ceremonial kiss from the<br />\ncocktail waitresses. When it came time to choose a<br />\nmoniker for our plastered premier, I still had mind<br />\nenough for literary puns and, suggested King Tight Ass<br />\nAndronicus.<br />\nIt went right over the heads of the<br />\n\"sounded<br />\nleisure-suiters, but they all agreed that it<br />\nwas.<br />\nregal\" so King Tight Ass it<br />\nI thought by then we had seen the last of Noosh's<br />\nantics for the night, but when things quieted down he was<br />\nPlaying at lago once again.\"Hey Dale...! mean King Tight<br />\nAss your Magnificence, you're the new King alright...but<br />\nfor how long?\"<br />\n\"Whaaaddaayameeen?\" slurred His Grace.<br />\n\"I mean, how long is it gonna be before some punk<br />\nlookin' to make a name for himself comes in here and<br />\ntties to take the crown for his own? Kids today, man,<br />\nthey're on heroin by sixth grade. With all due respect,<br />\nbooze is like soda pop to them.\"<br />\n\"Whaadammayygonnadoo?\" slobbered His Excellency.<br />\n\"My liege,\" continued the crafty Machiavell ,\"I have a<br />\ndrink, that, if you down it, would make your throne<br />\nunreachable.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Whaaazzit caaalled?\" blubbered His Potency.<br />\n\"A Black Death Fizz on a Stick.\"<br />\n\"Briinggit onnn!\" shouted the haughty sovereign.<br />\n\"Roy-boy!\" called Noosh,\"render unto Caesar what is<br />\nCaesar's!\"<br />\nI begged; I pleaded; I threatened; but he persisted. He<br />\nwanted to be King for life, and considerations of health<br />\nhad no place in the matter. I tried my damnedest, but it<br />\nwas all for naught. Very well then, very well...The Black<br />\nDeath Fizz on a Stick: Equal parts Southern Comfort,<br />\nTequila, One-fifty-one, Beefeater gin, and Johnny Walker<br />\nBlack.A splash of Apple Jack Brandy and Calvados for<br />\nflavor, a dash of Ouzo for sadism. Pour into a tall glass,<br />\nadd ice,(which, incidentally, melts inside of ten seconds),<br />\nstir in a teaspoon of sugar, top with a twist of lemon, and<br />\nstand back.<br />\n\"Of course, it's a shooter, Your Pharoahship.\"<br />\nYou know, as drunk as he was, and as insensitive to<br />\npain as he was, and as confident as he was-- half that<br />\nsucker refused to stay down.<br />\nFeature that.<br />\nIt so happened that Noosh got the rejected half<br />\nsquarely in his puss (The Sultan of Sobriety had just<br />\nturned his head to congratulate the little bastard for<br />\nsuggesting such an excellent night-cap) so it wasn't a total<br />\nloss.<br />\nThe coronation festivities being finally at an end, it<br />\ncame time to see the Royal Personage home. No small<br />\ntask, I assure you. It was two a.m., and the Law (no<br />\nrespecter of traditions) would soon be cruising by in a<br />\nblack-and-white to oversee the legal bolting of<br />\npublic-house doors. The first conveyance we tried was a<br />\nchair consisting of two Young & Alive flunkies corssing<br />\ntheir arms under the royal buttocks. This failed, due<br />\nlargely to the fact that the bearers were themselves<br />\nroundly soused and unable to get His Corpulence past the<br />\nlobby, where they collapsed into a sandwich board,<br />\nreducing it to splinters. From here on, less dignified<br />\nmeasures were employed to move the Comatose One into<br />\nthe open air. He was half dragged, half pushed through<br />\nthe ornate double doors and onto the cold surface of the<br />\nparking lot, where all movement ceased.<br />\n<br />\nThe drunken leisure-suiters, refusing to leave the scene<br />\nof so much recent hilarity, clustered about the fallen<br />\nRaja, placing bets on the exact time that he would blow<br />\nthe royal cookies. The problem was a bit more serious<br />\nthan that, for His Majesty, I felt sure, was legally dead in<br />\nthirty-four states. Here he was--the man, who, just short<br />\nhours before, had been my faithful and generous<br />\nHost--now nothing more than a hunk of meat in over half<br />\nthe nation.<br />\nTears came to my eyes.<br />\nPicking up an empty beer bottle, I hurled it to the<br />\npavement. Instantly, the gambling vultures ceased their<br />\nmindless racket and stared inquiringly in my direction.<br />\nStraightening up, to my full,weaving height, and eyeing<br />\nthem with stern determination, I proceeded to recite<br />\nShakespeare's moving and solemn requiem for the<br />\ndeparted Kings of Self Abuse:<br />\nFor God's sake, let us sit upon the ground,<br />\nAnd tell sad stories of the death of kings:<br />\nflow some have been pickled;some slain in bars;<br />\nSome haunted by the bartenders they haven't tipped;<br />\nSome poisn'd by rockgut;some driving home killed.<br />\nAll murder'd. for within the hollow crown<br />\nThat rounds the mortal edge ofa shot glass<br />\nKeeps Death his court; and there the barkeep sits,<br />\nScoffing at his dribbles, and grinning at his puke,<br />\nMowing him a night out, a little scene<br />\nTo monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with his breath;<br />\nInfusing him with vile and tainted hootch<br />\nAs if this flesh, which walls about our life<br />\nWere sponge unsoakable; and plastered thus,<br />\nComes at last with a little gin<br />\nPours through his castle-wall, and -- farewell king!<br />\n\"O000...that's magnificent!\" cried one lusty<br />\nleisure-suiter mere seconds before his head hit the<br />\npavement with a dull thud. There were now two lifeless<br />\nsacks of booze -embalmed flesh on the ground,<br />\n<br />\nspread-eagled and side by side, pictures of youthful<br />\ndissipation. The Price & Pride of the liquor mart.<br />\n\"Poor Bob's had it,\" said a voice at my ear. \"I guess<br />\nyou and I better get these guys to our cars.\" Nodding in<br />\nagreement, I picked up my Liege's arms and prepared to<br />\ndrag him around the back of the restaurant. The other<br />\n'chap did likewise with poor Bob.<br />\nIt was just then that a figure emerged from, or rather,<br />\nstaggered out of, the still milling crowd, a wad of bills<br />\nclenched in his fist. \"Hey people, _hey!\" he shouted.<br />\n\"Let's have a race! C'mon, let's have a race! My money's<br />\non the King!\" By this time it should surprise no one when<br />\nI report that this sadistie suggestion exacted a chorus of<br />\nenthusiastic agreement from the assembled harlequins. I<br />\nwas ebout to tell them where they could all stuff next<br />\nyear's cocaine allowance, when, to my shock and chagrin,<br />\nthe Shah of Cirrhosis groaned thusly:<br />\n\"Mush!\"<br />\n\"What was that?\" I asked, not quite believing my ears.<br />\n\"Ahh,saad mush, y000 falthy s000n owa biSh!\"<br />\nWell! If I was going to be so shabbily mistreated by the<br />\nman who had ascended to power on my shoulders, then I<br />\ncertainly had no objections to turning his backside into a<br />\ndogsled. If he wanted to crap standing up for the rest of<br />\nhis natural life, who was I to stand in his way? I turned to<br />\nthe leisure-suiter who was ahold of poor Bob, he nodded a<br />\nboozy \"What the Hell?\" and the regatta was on.<br />\nPicture the scene if you will: The parking lot of a<br />\nrespectable French restaurant at two-thirty in the<br />\nmorning. Two hearty gents in the lead, running backwards<br />\nwith all their might, both dragging a supine body behind<br />\nthem. Bringing up the rear, a running, stumbling crowd of<br />\nracing enthusiasts shouting encouragement and. waving<br />\nbills and cocktail glasses in the air.<br />\nWe were about halfway through the clubhouse turn and<br />\nat least three lengths in the lead when I noticed that part<br />\nof his Majesty's jacket which was in contact with the<br />\npavement had begun to smoke ominously. Accordingly, I<br />\nreduced our furious clip in an effort to head off a<br />\nconflagration. No sooner had I done so, however, than his<br />\nDrunkenness began shouting, \"Mush! Mush!\" at the top<br />\nof his lungs and calling me every foul name in his<br />\nbooze-bathed brain.<br />\nLike I said--it was his butt, not mine. I leaned into the<br />\nwind and pulled as if all Goucher was waiting topless at<br />\nthe finish line.<br />\nIt couldn't have been more than five seconds later that<br />\nI heard a ripping sound, andwatched as the Regal britches<br />\nparted company with the royal rump and were instantly<br />\nleft behind like a snake's shedded skin. The debris got<br />\ntangled up in the feet of the foremost racing enthusiast,<br />\ncausing a human pile-up which resembled an open-air<br />\norgy. It was an amazing spectacle, to be sure, but I had<br />\npreciously little time to chuckle, for it was just then that<br />\nthe inevitable happened and my Host's smoldering jacket<br />\nburst into bright,orange flames.<br />\n\"Hey, hey!\" shouted one of the few remaining<br />\nenthusiasts, still stumbling along behind. \"With arl that<br />\none-fifty-one in him, he'll probably BLOW all to HELL!<br />\nHaw!haw!haw!haw!haw!!!

Each gag takes you by<br />\nsurprise and leaves youmore and more<br />\nvulnerable to further attack. Pretty soon<br />\nyou end up in a painfully hilarious state<br />\nthat you can't bear to endure but that<br />\nyou'd hate to end.<br />\nThis weekend's Wonderflix features<br />\nthree Mel Brooks movies-- Blazing<br />\nSaddles, Young Frankenstein, and High<br />\nAnxiety. The first two represent Brooks<br />\nat his finest; the last is a little too<br />\npolished and lacks some of the essential<br />\nBrooks spontaneity. Because his films are<br />\nstructured around mainly physical gags<br />\nand one-liners, spontaneity is crucial to<br />\nthe pacing and, thus, the humor. In this<br />\nrespect, Silent Movie (as the name<br />\nimplies) is a tour de force. Dom deLuise's<br />\ncoke machine barrage and Henny<br />\nYoungman's fly in his soup obviate the<br />\nneed for language.<br />\nBrooks' ensemble of players, including<br />\nMadeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, Dom<br />\ndeLuise, Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman<br />\nand Brooks himself, helps sustain an<br />\natmosphere of spontaneity. Accustomed<br />\nto working together, they share a any,<br />\ninfectious sense of unspoken<br />\ncommunication not unlike the Marx<br />\n<br />\nBrothers'. Kahn, for instance, pouts and<br />\nlilts her sultry voice in a manner as<br />\nsuggestive and camp as Groucho's cigar<br />\nflicking, eyebrow-raising routine. The<br />\nculmination of Wilder's, Feldman's and<br />\nTerry Garr's search for the mysterious<br />\nviolin in Young Frankenstein ends in a<br />\nfrenzied, fast-paced chase with Cloris<br />\nLeachman's one-line, melodramatic<br />\nadmission that the former Dr.<br />\nFrankenstein was her \"boyfriend.\" The<br />\ncomparatively sparse dialogue fits<br />\nhand-in-glove with the action. In short,<br />\nBrooks' movies pile gag after gag, scene<br />\nupon scene until, theybuild to a climax in<br />\nwhich the audience will believe<br />\nanything--even when s, Blazing Saddles<br />\ninvades a neighboring movie, invades<br />\nHollywood, and finally watches itself<br />\ndrive off into the TV commercial sunset.<br />\nBrooks' constant use of sight-gags,<br />\nslapstick, stereotype, and one-liners gives<br />\nhis movies the tone of a vaudeville show.<br />\nBrooks appeals to comedy's common<br />\ndenominator; most of his jokes concern<br />\nsex, bathroom humor or parody. Blazing<br />\nSaddles, though it includes Madeline<br />\nKahn's seductive rendition of \"I'm So<br />\nTired,\" is basically a bathroom joke,<br />\nculminating in the disgustingly fun ny<br />\nbake d-beans-around-the-campfire scene.<br />\nYoung Frankenstein, on the other hand,<br />\n<br />\nis almost totally sexual, from Terri Garr's<br />\nconfusion about the \"big knockers\" to<br />\nher willingness to assist Gene Wilder when<br />\nhe asks her to elevate him.<br />\nMany of Brooks' jokes are twists on<br />\ncommon occurrences in daily life or,<br />\nmore often, on common movie<br />\ntechniques. In his later movies, or at least<br />\nin High Anxiety, which he dedicated to<br />\nAlfred Hitchcock, these devices are<br />\nfrequently used. At the beginning of s,<br />\nHigh Anxiety, a woman with a mad look<br />\non her face rushes towards Brooks with<br />\nan umbrella; as it turns out, she is<br />\nactually rushing into her husband's arms,<br />\na perfectly natural action. Later on in the<br />\nfilm, tense music appears to set the scene<br />\nfor Brooks' doubts about the mental<br />\ninstitution's sanity. In a non-Brooks<br />\nmovie, the characters would not be able<br />\nto hear this music (intended only for the<br />\naudience); in ? High Anxiety, the<br />\ncharacters hear it and become alarmed.<br />\nAs a further twist, the characters and the<br />\naudience discover that the music is<br />\nactually being produced by a symphony<br />\norchestra on a passing bus.<br />\nAnother vaudeville technique Brooks<br />\nuses is repetition. In Young Frankenstein,<br />\nfor example, Marty Feldman's shifting<br />\nhump is a running gag (pardon the pun).<br />\nIn High Anxiety, he chauffeur's<br />\n<br />\nunsuccessful struggles to lift heavy<br />\nobjects while insisting, \"I got it, I got it\"<br />\nlets the audience participate in an in joke<br />\nand also fleshes out the character.<br />\nThough Blazing Saddles, Young<br />\nFrankenstein, and High Anxiety are<br />\nparodies of their respective<br />\ngenres--wester, horror, and suspense--each<br />\nstands on its own as a comic entity. These<br />\nmovies are funny even to viewers who<br />\nhave only vaguely heard of westerns,<br />\nhorror movies, or thrillers. Perhaps there<br />\nis something in American<br />\ncultures-probably commercials and<br />\nsit -corn allusions -that has<br />\nsubconsciously acquainted the public<br />\nwith these genres. In any event, Brooks'<br />\ngenius in parody is in creating gags that<br />\ndemonstrate what they plan to satire a<br />\nsplit-second before they zing in with the<br />\npunch line.<br />\nOddly enough, Brooks' humor, though<br />\nfrequently obscene and vulgar, is<br />\nsimultaneously heart-warming and<br />\nuplifting. Brooks achieves this effect by<br />\nallowing his love, for the object of his<br />\nparody, to transcend his spools digs. In<br />\nterms of his movies, this means creating<br />\nlovable zanies like Gene Wilder's Dr.<br />\nFrankensteinas well as Marty Feldman's<br />\nIgor and Peter Boyle's Frankenstein's<br />\nCont. on p. 17<br />\n<br />\nMel Brooks<br />\n<br />\nThe Ow+<br />\n<br />\nLoi Coxhill<br />\n<br />\nFederico Feih<br />\n<br />\nInteresting, But Is It Art?<br />\nBY STEPHEN BARR<br />\nIn December, the 1.11.U. Fine Arts<br />\nCommittee presented British saxophonist<br />\nLol Coxhill in his first American<br />\nconcert.This evening of solo saxophone<br />\nm usic was interesting and sometimes<br />\nfascinating. It also raised many perplexing<br />\nquestions about the nature of music and<br />\nart.<br />\nCox hill calls himself a free-form<br />\nmusician, meaning that his music is free<br />\nfrom any conventionalized restrictions of<br />\nform. To be free \u2022 from<br />\nin<br />\nconventions, though, implies that he is<br />\nfree from the limits of anyi one musical<br />\nstyle, but not from all. His compositions<br />\nshould be a synthesis of many varied<br />\nforms. Coxhill's music is not free-form,<br />\nbut free; he does not work with musical<br />\nforms, only with his saxophone. His<br />\nmusic is an exploration into the notes,<br />\nsounds, rhythms, and combinations there<br />\nof which he can extract from his<br />\ninstrument. It is atonal, and could be<br />\npraised as an investigation into the<br />\ntexture of noise,. but Coxhill can only be<br />\ndefined as a free musician who extracts<br />\nfrom the saxophone, but does not create<br />\nwith it.<br />\nThe nature of Coxhill's tunes, as he<br />\ncalls them, must be improvisational. The<br />\ndirection seems arbitrary, and each turn<br />\nof the notes and rhythms is in no way<br />\nrestricted by our notions of tonality and<br />\ntime. I have never heard Coxhill on<br />\nrecord, but I question whether any tune<br />\ncan ever be duplicated. Each tune--and I<br />\nwouldn't want to call them compositions<br />\nbecause that implies something that<br />\nexisted before, during and after the actual<br />\n\u2022 pc ifor ma lice --was a completely new<br />\nexperience not only for the listener, but<br />\nfor Coxhill himself. The main body of the<br />\ntunes was a furious attack on the<br />\n<br />\nsaxophone, and he could never convince<br />\nme that out of the randomness I heard,<br />\nthere was an underlying structure,or<br />\nframework, that he was working<br />\nwithin. Coxhill informed the audience<br />\nthat some tunes were based on<br />\nothers--one on Somewhere Over The<br />\nRainbow for example--but for this<br />\nlistener, it was impossible to discern any<br />\nsense of those songs in his music, even<br />\nwith his verbal suggestions. Perhaps<br />\nCoxhill heard these songs in his head, and<br />\nhe would ar ue that his music derived<br />\n<br />\nthe musical idea, hear what he did with it<br />\nand marvel at his ability to take musical<br />\nform and strip it of its conventions. The<br />\nrest of the tunes were anarchistic<br />\nbabbling.<br />\nCoxhill is not an artist, but an<br />\nexperimenter with sound. lie is trying to<br />\nexplore all the combinations of notes,<br />\nsounds and rhythms possible from the<br />\nsaxophone, and he is not limiting himself<br />\nto one possibility which would constitute<br />\na form. But this is not art. He does not<br />\ntake this formless music and put it into<br />\n<br />\nAAL.<br />\n<br />\nKeith Jarrett<br />\n<br />\nLot Coxhill<br />\n<br />\nITI14C0<br />\nfrom ordered ideas in his head. If Coxhill<br />\nbelieves this, his music does not work as<br />\nmusic or art. These ideas in his head were<br />\nnot conveyed to the audience through his<br />\nsaxophone. The most interesting part of<br />\nthe tunes was when Coxhill picked up a<br />\nmusical line or rhythm, and worked with<br />\nit creating various permutations of sound<br />\nfrom these pre-existing sequences. In<br />\nthese instances, the audience could hear<br />\n<br />\nsomecolierent order. Since there is no<br />\nsense of order, there is no sense of<br />\ncreation. Without creation there is no art.<br />\nCoxhill tells us there is order, but he<br />\ndoesn't demonstrate it to the audience in<br />\nthe sound produced. He is missing an<br />\nimportant element of art. My definition<br />\nof art is contingent on a discourse<br />\nbetween artist and audience, and<br />\nalthough art can be highly personal, it<br />\n<br />\nmust contain this conimunicative element<br />\nin order to work. Coxhill's tunes do not.<br />\nThe most popular contemporary<br />\nartist/musician to Coxhill would certainly<br />\nbe pianist Keith Jarrett. Jarrett is famous<br />\nfor his solo concerts in which he<br />\nimprovises entirely, to the point of not<br />\nhaving any idea what he might play<br />\nbefore he begins, lie does not work<br />\nwithin a framework, but his<br />\nimprovisation is amazingly rhytlunic and<br />\nmelodic. The parts flow together, though,<br />\nand the listener is not alienated by any<br />\nkind of randomness or arbitrariness as in<br />\nthe work of Coxhill. Jarrett's tabula rasa<br />\nimprovisations are smooth, logical and<br />\ncoherent. Jarrett and Coxhill have the<br />\nsame vision and approach to music and<br />\nimprovisation, but there is only so much<br />\ndisorder and anarchy a person can take.<br />\nIndict me for Philistinism, but I refuse to<br />\nbe one who praises everything and<br />\nanything that is different from that which<br />\nis popular, logical, melodic and even<br />\ncommercial. Jarrett's solo music is<br />\nsomewhat disarming, but always<br />\nbeautiful; Coxhill's tunes are sometimes<br />\ninteresting, but always disarming. The<br />\ndifference between 'beautiful' and<br />\n'interesting' is the difference between<br />\nJarrett and Coxhill, and between art and<br />\nnoise.<br />\nCoxhill went so far as to insult his<br />\naudience by telling us that if we ever<br />\nheard a melody, it was purely accidental.<br />\nIf Coxhill believes that music that is<br />\ndifferent will not be melodic, then it is<br />\nhis music that must be indicted as<br />\npretentious. I like very much his<br />\nintentions to explore the possibilities of<br />\nsound with the saxophone, but to<br />\nconsciously disregard the essential<br />\nelements of music, no matter what you<br />\ndo with them, makes his tunes nothing<br />\nmore than meritricious claptrap.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAUt:<br />\n<br />\nScoreboard For Fav Four<br />\n_<br />\n0<br />\nAt Christmas time, the movie ./<br />\nIAlffl<br />\nindustry shifts into high gear, releasing an<br />\ninordinate amount of new films for the<br />\nholiday movie-going crowd, hoping to<br />\nVincent Canby<br />\ncatch the public's fancy during this<br />\nfestive season\u2014 when otrr defences are<br />\nThe New York Times<br />\ndown.

This season the Blue<br />\nJays are led by first year Coach<br />\nPat Lohrey, who has instituted a<br />\nnew program of conditioning and<br />\ndevelopment. The program,<br />\nbased on that developed at Penn<br />\nState several years ago,<br />\nemphasizes continuous drills and<br />\nround-robin wrestling in an effort<br />\nto take full advantage of the<br />\nmany different styles employed<br />\nby this year's team members.<br />\nDuring the meet at Loyola<br />\njunior Bob Cherry, wrestling in<br />\nthe 118-pound weight class,<br />\n\"started with a pin for six and<br />\nthe team never let down,\"<br />\naccording to Lohrey. The points<br />\ncontinued to pour into the Blue<br />\nJay column, as sophomore Dan<br />\nSussman (126), junior Kevin<br />\nDoring (158), freshman Greg<br />\nHaladyna (167) and Mike Miller<br />\n<br />\n,(177), and senior Don Hecht<br />\n(190) all scored pins against their<br />\nrespective opponents, while<br />\nsophomore Jack Lu (142) and<br />\njunior Russ Brown (150) earned<br />\ndecisions. Sophomore Pat Owen<br />\ntied for two more Blue Jay<br />\npoints, while rookie junior Bob<br />\nCassilly was pinned in the<br />\nheavyweight category.<br />\nLohrey has confidence that his<br />\nteam will continue to show<br />\nimprovement as the season<br />\nprogresses. They appear to be<br />\ntougher than ever and wrestle<br />\nwell as a team. In fact, their<br />\n\"team identity\" is a major factor<br />\nin the improvement of the squad<br />\nsince last year. Along with<br />\nCherry, the strength of the team<br />\nlies in the weight classes from<br />\n150-177. This group starts with<br />\nteam captain Russ Brown, who<br />\nweighs in at 150. Lohrey views<br />\nBrown as the pivotal man in the<br />\nlineup.

Eisenhower Symposium, the<br />\nSpring Fair organization and the<br />\nWomen's Center.<br />\nThese campus groups, which<br />\nalong with the Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization were<br />\nfound to have valid needs for<br />\nspace to conduct business, have<br />\nbeen given other offices under a<br />\nplan which Director of Student<br />\nServices Albert (Tom)Schmith<br />\nthinks will satisfy all parties<br />\nconcern .\"At least, we haven't<br />\nhad anybody complaining yet,\"<br />\nSchmith commented.<br />\nThe plan leaves the second<br />\nfloor as it was, with the Little<br />\nTheater reserved for alternate use<br />\nas a conference room when other<br />\nconference rooms are full.<br />\nGroups presently using the<br />\nsecond floor include the tutoring<br />\ncommittee, Chester's Place, the<br />\nStudent Council, Bob Arellano's<br />\nplaywriting classes, a recently<br />\nformed music co-op, and the<br />\nWriting Seminars' poetry and<br />\nprose readings.<br />\nThe G.R.O. also stays where it<br />\nis, in one corner of the Student<br />\nActivities Commission office. A<br />\nnew room, however, has been<br />\nbuilt in an adjacent corner of the<br />\noffice to accomodate the Spring<br />\nFair committee and the<br />\nEisenhower Symposium. The<br />\nChaplain's Office donated an<br />\noffice in Merryman Hall for the<br />\nWomen's Center. \"Our<br /><br />\nphilosophy was that students<br />\nshould accomodate students,\"<br />\nexplained Schmith. \"Everybody<br />\ngave a little...It was a community<br />\neffort.\"<br />\nThe suggestion to divert the<br />\nsecond floor to office space was<br />\nfirst advanced in a survey made<br />\nby Director of Student Activities<br />\nChris Colombo in order to find<br />\nspace for the previously<br />\nmentioned groups--especially for<br />\nthe Spring Fair committee, which<br />\nis already gearing up for Hopkins'<br />\nannual carnival. Protest was loud<br />\nand immediate. A petition<br />\ncirculated by the groups involved<br />\npicked up approximately 700<br />\nsignatures in three days.<br />\nDavid Fishkin, who heads the<br />\nChaplain's Tutoring office, was a<br />\nleader in the protest. \"We made<br />\nit very clear to Colonel Schmith<br />\nthat we needed the space,\" said<br />\nFishkin. \"It (Chester's Place) has<br />\nbecome a tradition. It's the only<br />\nsmall theater on campus, and<br />\ncombined with the muraled<br />\nroom, there's no other place like<br />\nit.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the<br />\npetition, Schmith said, \"The<br />\nsignatures didn't matter. We<br />\ntalked to Bob Arellano and<br />\nChaplain Wickwire. We asked the<br />\nUnion Board and Student<br />\nCouncil for recommendations.<br />\nEverybody said to keep the Little<br />\nTheater. Of course we took that<br />\ninto consideration, but we also<br />\nwanted the most efficient use of<br />\nspace and monies. The new office<br />\ndown there is infinitely cheaper<br />\nthan renovation upstairs. Their<br />\nown room also gives security to<br />\nM.S.E. and the Spring Fair.\"<br /><br />\nThis building's name is Mudd.<br /><br />\nSeeley Mudd Hall Opens<br />\nFor First Biology Classes<br />\nBY HARRY LERNER<br /><br />\nannoyance, and alternate rooms<br />\nhave been reserved for classes<br />\nAt 9 A.M.

The raccoons<br />\nhad company; freshmen have<br />\ncomplained of huge rats in the<br />\ndormitory area. Admitted<br />\nPresident Steven Muller, \"I did<br />\nnotice several rodents gambolling<br />\naround and...I understand the<br />\nproblem has gotten worse with<br />\nthe construction of Mudd Hall,<br />\nwhich may have disturbed, on<br />\none hand, their natural habitats<br />\nout of sight and, on the other<br />\nhand, probably created, with<br />\nworkmen leaving...debris, created<br />\na more attractive environment<br />\nfor them to scavenge in...The<br />\nreason we have the problem<br />\naround Mudd Hall is because the<br />\npeople who have been working<br />\non that building eat their lunch<br />\naround there...and they leave<br />\ngarbage.\"<br />\n\"I understand the building is<br />\nbuilt like a bomb shelter,\" hinted<br />\nPieget, but contrary to rumor,<br />\nMudd Hall is not a secret missile<br />\nsilo for the APL.

Within the space of a year,<br />\nshe became administrative assistant, acting and then<br />\npermanent Housings Director. Certainly, her rise was<br />\noccasioned more by good fortune than by any 'outstanding<br />\nbrilliance she displayed. But this in no way detracts from<br />\nthe record .she compiled during her tenure. All in all, she<br />\nperformed very creditably.<br />\nChief among the innovations for which she was<br />\nresponsible is the new housing lottery through which all<br />\nspaces were made available to both undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate students. This system, worked so well that in<br />\nseveral categories of apartment spaces every student who<br />\nentered the lottery eventually received an option on some<br />\ntype of University accomodation. The new method is much<br />\nfairer than the old way when graduate students were given a<br />\npreference and undergraduates could only slip in through<br />\nthe back door.<br />\nThe recent departures of Umran and of Martha Grimm<br />\nhave left a noticeable vacuum. Her temporarysuccessor, in a<br />\npart-time role, will doubtless do her best, but a full-time<br />\nDirector is needed. The University in the past has placed<br />\npitifully little emphasis on the directorship within its<br />\nbureaucratic hierarchy. But it is a position which directly<br />\naffects a large number of students, and a serious effort<br />\nshould be made to replace Uras as soon as possible.<br /><br />\nNo Clean Sweep<br />\nWith its noncommittal response to the student outcry<br />\nover the treatment received by the janitorial staff in the<br />\nDepartment of Housekeeping, Richard Zdanis and the<br />\nadministration have in effect washed their hands of the<br />\nmatter.<br />\nThey are still far from clean, however. The janitors<br />\nremain u-nhappy, and the student unrest continues,.<br />\nsharpened by the tactic the administration adopted of<br />\nletting the matter die over the semester break. Its repeated<br />\nrefusal to meet with concerned students and union leaders<br />\nat one time is further evidence of a lack of good faith in<br />\nresolving the problem.<br />\nThe Office of Plant Planning has done its best to sweep<br />\nthe _janitors and their grievances under the rug.

I am<br />\nspeaking, of course, of the<br />\nappalling lack of consideration<br />\nafforded the Hillbilly students in<br />\nattendance at this University.<br />\nAlthough a small and taciturn<br />\nminority here, the faction of the<br />\nstudent body which calls the<br />\nsouthern portion of the<br />\nAppalachian mountain chain<br />\ntheir home are conspicuously<br />\noverlooked, it seems to me, by<br />\nthe student council, social<br />\ncommittees, Administration, and<br />\nthe News-Letter itself (an<br />\notherwise impeccable publication). I esteem myself a humble<br />\nmember of this much discriminated against faction. Among my<br />\ninnumerable grievances:<br />\n1. The utter inavailability of<br />\nMoonshine or Home Brew at the<br />\nRat.<br />\n2. The absence of square<br />\ndances and turkey shoots that<br />\nmight be sponsored by Classes of<br />\nthe student government.<br />\n3. The impossibility of<br />\npurchasing chewing tobacco at<br />\nthe Union Desk (the Snuff<br />\ncurrently being sold at the<br />\nbookstore is a nice touch,<br />\nhowever).<br />\n4. The fact that Dixie Dick is<br />\nrelegated to the back pages of the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\n5. That such prestigious<br />\nnational leaders as Howard Baker<br />\nand Robert Byrd are never<br />\ninvited to speak at Symposiums<br />\nfor the painfully obvious reason<br />\nthat they are Hillbillies.<br />\n6. That Lester Maddox pick<br />\naxe handles are nowhere to be<br />\npurchased.<br />\nIt is my sincere hope that in<br />\nenumerating these grievances, the<br />\nglaring inadequacies in the<br />\nUniversity's treatment of<br />\nHillbilly and Mountaineer<br />\nstudents might be rectified.

Apparently, one of the portlier<br />\npatrons in the Versailles Room had decided that<br />\nconsomme would be the perfect cap-off to his dinner,<br />\npronounced that fact loudly to the waiter, and started a<br />\nAs a result,<br />\ngeneral trend among the other tables.<br />\nthe kitchen was flooded with orders for consomme:<br />\nNot beef consomme; not chicken consomme; oh<br />\nno sir! It was to be 'Belgian consomme or nothing for<br />\nthat happy gourmand--and as he went, so went the dining<br />\nroom. My host, a picture of tired annoyance, gave me this<br />\nexplanation as he caught his breath in the hallway. Grimy<br />\nkitchen sweat dripped from a broad and panting face, his<br />\nfloppy chef's hat had fallen in on one side like an<br />\nunfortunate souffle, and his soiled apron resembled a<br />\nVictorian surgeon's gown.<br />\n\"Do you even have any Belgian consomme?\"<br />\ninquired.<br />\n\"We do now. It's gonna taste like the insides of a<br />\nwino's hat, but he'll probably ooh and aah over it like at<br />\nA-rab at Disney World to show his chick what a table de<br />\nhote he is.\"<br />\nAt this point the frowning head of an underling poked<br />\nout from the kitchen door.\"Hey Dale,\" it queried,\"what<br />\nelse goes in this stuff?\"<br />\n\"Hmmm...:et's see...What's something really<br />\nnauseating?\"<br />\n\"Yams?\" I volunteered.<br />\n\"The very thing!\"chuckled my Host, snapping his<br />\nfingers approvingly. Turning back to the still protruding<br />\nhead, he instructed in a solemn and official tone: \"Yes. I<br />\nwant one large, unheated yam floating obscenely in each<br />\nbowl, understood?\" The head dutifully nodded and then<br />\nquickly vanished, leaving me alone with my perspiring<br />\nHost. \"This Belgian Bowl o'Barf is gonna take about<br />\nfifteen minutes. Go ahead into the bar and suck on<br />\nsomething.\"<br />\nAnd so I sat, whisky sour in hand,<br />\nhoping that I stuck out from the gaggle of leisure-suited<br />\ncretins and eagerly awaiting my Host's appearance from<br />\nthe bowels of the kitchen. The Establishment, which,<br />\nupon the frenzied pleadings of the News-Letter legal<br />\ndepartment shall remain nameless, was typical of the<br />\n\"New Elegance\" school of suburban restaurants.Catering<br />\nto two groups of clientele\u2014the Young &amp; Alive and the<br />\nBlond &amp; In Touch\u2014it featured that thoroughly seventies<br />\ncombination of overpriced French cuisine inside and<br />\noverpriced cocaine in the parking lot. Thousands had been<br />\nspent on the bar in a vain attempt to create a cozy,<br />\n\"spontaneous\" atmosphere, and it showed. Not nearly<br />\nenough had been spent in recruiting the roving guitar<br />\nplayer, and it sounded like it. The whisky sours were<br />\nwatered, and tasted like it. But, when you're not quite<br />\ntwenty-one, and look it, you smile nicely at the bartender<br />\nand act absolutely delighted at whatever he deigns to<br />\nserve.<br />\nWhen my Host finally arrived some twenty minutes<br />\nlater, he was a changed man. Gone was every vestment of<br />\nsweaty chelhood, replaced instead by the cool and steady<br />\ndemeanor of his civilian life. We settled down to the usual<br />\nquotas of \"good-to-have-you-backs\" and waited for the<br />\nworld to get friendlier by degrees. It wasn't until halfway<br />\nthrough his second rum &amp; coke that he announced to the<br />\nbartender and myself that he would \"go for the Throne\"<br />\ntonight in my honor.<br />\nA troubled look came into the bartender's eye.<br />\n\"The Throne?\" I asked.<br />\n\"The Throne...\" he solemnly replied \"...of Self Abuse.<br />\nBut first I have to get primed.\"<br />\n\"Priming\" consisted of no less than six rum &amp; cokes, all<br />\nleisurely consumed while we chatted about our recent sex<br />\nlives. (I know for a fact that Dixie Dick's recent sex life<br />\nruns through no less than twenty-one beers, which equals<br />\nout to about fifteen and a half rum &amp; cokes. But that,<br />\nyou miserable lechers, is a throne of a different kind). My<br />\n!lost also informed me as to why the bartender took such<br />\na dim view of the planned proceedings..It seems that the<br />\nworthy gentleman himself was the reigning monarch, and<br />\ndid not like to encourage the aspirations (no matter how<br />\nunlikely I of any Johnny-Walker-come-lately upstart<br />\nusurpers.<br />\nWhen the preliminaries were safely in our stomachs. my<br />\nHost straightened himself on his stool, slapped the bar top<br />\nwith a beefy hand, and announced to whom it may have<br />\nconcerned: \u2014 Now! Down to business! Roy, a<br />\nOne-fifty-one...aflame if you please!\"<br />\nReigning King Roy, mindful of his duty as a barkeep,<br />\nproduced a shot glass tilled to the brim with a clear liquid<br />\nand gently touched a lighted match to its placid surface.<br /><br />\nA drama in true life by<br /><br />\nCates Baldridge<br />\nBlue flame danced delicately skyward. The ritual Was<br />\nbegun.<br />\nA humble aspirant to the .Throne am I,<br />\nJust a sotted, potted, plastered guy.<br />\nAnd ifI die a commoner still,<br />\nYou can pickle my guts in this filthy swill !!!<br />\n\"Down the hatch!\"<br />\nHis lips pursed for a split second as the flame curled the<br />\nlonger hairs of his moustache into sizzling gobs of protein,<br />\nthen opened to receive the mighty elixir. Up went the<br />\nglass, down went the rum. Friends, he took it like a man.<br />\nNot a peep--not even a moist eye to mark what had passed<br />\nfrom tongue to gullet in a scalding arch.<br />\n\"Wasn't that a little...hot?\"<br />\n\"Indeed it was, which furnishes us with the theme for<br />\nthis assault upon the Throne.\"<br />\n\"I didn't know you had to have a goddamn theme,<br />\ntoo.\"<br />\n\"That's 'cause you weren't raised right. Barkeep!\" Roy<br />\nsauntered over in no particular hurry.\"Roy, my boy, the<br />\ntheme of this evening is going to be heat, and<br />\naccordingly,I will abuse my body with only those drinks<br />\nwhich pertain to that theme. Like for instance...a Mexican<br />\nFlag.\" Roy's interest perked up right away. Apparently<br />\nthere was stomething about that particular libation which<br />\nsuggested that this drinker meant business.<br />\n\"Hey Noosh!\" Roy called out over the bar. \"We got a<br />\nMexican Flag drinker here! Better tie down the<br />\nfurniture!\" Noosh, who appeared to be a somewhat<br />\nhigher level functionary, materialized at my Host's elbow<br />\nalmost immediately, sporting a close cropped beard and a<br />\ntwinkle of demonic delight in his hard, black eyes. He<br />\nlooked amazingly like a young Sigmund Freud.<br />\n\"you goin' for the Throne, Dale?\"<br />\n\"Just so.\"<br />\n\"Never make it.\"<br />\n\"Bullshit. Stick around.\"<br />\nThe Mexican Flag arrived, and a pretty little bugger it<br />\nwas, too. The Cream Denoyce, One-fifty-one, and green<br />\nchartreuse of which it was made had separated into<br />\ndistinct layers of red, white and green respectively--just<br />\nlike the proud banner for which it was named.<br />\n\"Hey, that looks...good. I'll have one too,\" I<br />\nannounced.<br />\n\"You'll be sorry, college boy.\"<br />\n\"No doubt. Set it up, Roy.\" It was to be a double<br />\nshoot. \"After all,\" I thought, as the potion touched my<br />\nnovice lips, \"such a pretty drink couldn't FRY MY<br />\nBRAINAGGGIIHIIIIIIHH! My head whipped back in a<br />\nconvulsive jerk, which was surprising sinces I felt<br />\nreasonably sure that my entire neck had been instantly<br />\nincinerated. Montezuma's Revenge continued its fiery<br />\ndescent, etching \"Yankee Go Home\" on my buckling<br />\nstomach. As I slowly regained composure, Noosh's<br />\ndevilish ,rin floated into view.<br /><br />\n\"Hell of a drink, ain't it son? What's next, Dale?\"<br />\n\"I don't know,\" replied my Host, who seemed to have<br />\ntaken his brush with the Grim Reaper rather better than<br />\nthis reporter. \"I've heard about a drink called a Praire<br />\nFire, but I don't know what's in it.\"<br />\nNoosh's demonic grin advanced two notches to pure<br />\nsatanic delight. \"I know.\" The fiend chuckled. \"Be glad<br />\nto make one for ya, Dale.\"<br />\n\"Great.\"<br />\n\"Of course now, it's a shooter. You can't sip this one.\"<br />\nI smelled a rat.<br />\n\"What's in it?\" my Host inquired, apparently receiving<br />\na similar olfactory input.<br />\n\"Tell you what. I'll make it, you drink it, and<br />\nthen you tell /ne what's in it.\"<br />\n\"Well...\"<br /><br />\n\"Of course now, it's a shooter. I'm not gonna make it if<br />\nyou're gonna queen around and sip the damn thing.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, but...\"<br />\n\"Hey Dale...you gonna be the new King or what?\"<br />\nMy Host stiffened. \"That's why the hell I'm here, now<br />\nisn't it? Set it up, Noosh. Do your worst.\" Mephistophilis<br />\ndeparted straight away to prepare his witch's brew, and I<br />\nnervously watched as he and Roy bent over a sink at the<br />\nfar end of the bar. As soon as ol Roy saw just what was<br />\ngoing into the Praire Fire, his eyes widened in wonder and<br />\nhe actually backed off a step or two, seemingly for<br />\nprotection. All the while his jaw hung down and his head<br />\nwagged back and forth in foolish amazement. I shuddered<br />\nto think on the heinous concoction that could turn the<br />\nhead of a hardened bartender and reigning King of Self<br />\nAbuse. Noosh was now holding a shot glass in one hand<br />\nand shaking something from a small bottle vigorously into<br />\nit, his beard fairly bristling with fiendish delight.<br />\nHalf a minute later the item was deposited in front of<br />\nmy Host. Small, nasty, and red, it was a drink straight<br />\nfrom the Seventh Circle of Hell.<br />\n\"Remember, Dale, it's a shooter.\"<br /><br />\nMy Host looked at it suspiciously, then looked at<br />\nNoosh very suspiciously, then looked around for help.<br />\nThere was none to be had. Quite a crowd had gathered by<br />\nthis time, but they were all bent towards him in twisted<br />\nanticipation, like a mob urging a leaper from the ledge.<br />\nHe shot it alright--but it fired back. The glass came<br />\ndown with a sharp crack, sending silver slivers the length<br />\nof the bar. Fluid gushed from his nose and eyes, dribbled<br />\nfrom his ears. His mouth had compressed itself into an<br />\nugly round dot, and his foot kicked wildly at the<br />\nbaseboards in a vain attempt to distract himself from the<br />\npain. The crowd went wild.<br />\n\"Himmie...wa-er!\" he groaned from behind clenched<br />\nteeth. \"Himmie... wa-er!\" \"Uh, I believe he requires a<br />\nbit of water before he continues.\"<br />\n\"I believe you're right,\" Roy answered. \"One tall,<br />\ndelicious, cool...\"<br />\n\"Get on with it, Roy,\" I threatened.<br />\n\"...water coming up.\" He gave me a dirty look, took a<br />\ntall glass, filled it with cool, delicious gin and pushed it<br />\ntowards my thrashing Host. This was cruelty, and I said<br />\nso. Noosh, apparently worried over the prospect of a<br />\nnegligent homicide rap,reached over the bar and fetched<br />\nout a quart carton of milk, which he quickly placed under<br />\nmy Host's beet-red nose. Five seconds later it was gone.<br />\nWhen my Host finally composed himself, he looked<br />\nrather sternly at the bearded provocateur and calmly<br />\ninformed him: \"You're going to die, Noosh. Yes, yes,<br />\nyou're going to die. Not because of what you did to that<br />\ntwelve-year-old girl last week, not because you were the<br />\narchitect of the Pol Pot regime, not even because you<br />\nsteal our tips. No, my little Nooshy, you're going to die<br />\nbecause you put a lot of Tabasco sauce in that drink.\"<br />\n\"A full fourth to be exact,\" quoted an unperturbed<br />\nNoosh. \"The other three parts were straight vodka. One<br />\nhell of a drink, eh?\" My Host had taken a long time to<br />\ncool off, and the crowd was getting restless as a result.<br />\nThey wanted blood, thrown up or otherwise: The masses<br />\nwere yearning for a new monarch, and suggestions for<br />\nnew and even more bizarre cocktails rang out from their<br />\nranks with bloodthirsty eagerness.<br />\nI had been matching each of my Host's indiscretions<br />\nwith a straight whisky shot of my own (don't forget<br />\nabout the six rum &amp; cokes), so things became a bit<br />\nconfused about this time. Of course I stopped in the<br />\ninterest of responsible journalism, but all that remains for<br />\na while are the names of the subsequent drinks and their<br />\ncontents, which I hastily scrawled on a cocktail napkin.<br />\n(Roy was much more cooperative when I told him his<br />\nname would be in print. He said he'd been meaning to<br />\nsubscribe to Newsweek for years now). Anyhow, the<br />\nCoronation Night proceeded as follows.<br />\nThe Jelly Bean: Tequila, ouzo, and grenadine in a shot<br />\nglass. Looks like a jelly bean. Tastes like a jelly bean.<br />\nWorks like a lobotomy.<br />\nThe Harbour Light: One fifth tequila, Wild Turkey, and<br />\nkahluat This one got away from oh' Roy when he lit it on<br />\nfire. He'd been sloppy in the preparations and as a result<br /><br />\nke\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nard<br /><br />\nIt<br /><br />\nflames leaped onto the sink and from there to the bar<br />\nwhere two hookers from the Marriot down the street were<br />\nslightly singed. No major damage, but one of the scorched<br />\nwomen loudly informed poor Roy that as far as she was<br />\nconcerned, he had lost his \"bartender's discount\" for the<br />\nrest of fiscal '79.<br />\nThe Gin Go-Blind Cocktail: I can't remember quite<br />\nwhat went into this ghastly item, and it isn't written<br />\ndown anywhere, but it's just as well because I hear it's<br />\nillegal in Maryland anyway. My Host reported that his left<br />\nleg went dead just after drinking it.<br />\nThe Mother Superior: A martini with a prune instead<br />\nof an olive. I swear, it seemed funny as hell at the time.<br />\nThe Root Beer Float: Galliano, kaluha, cocoa, and a<br />\nsplash of coke. Mild and harmless, but the girl who<br />\nsuggested it had the biggest set of kegs in four counties. If<br />\nyou'd seen her, you'd have drunk the damn thing, too.<br />\nThe Long Island Iced Tea: Equal parts vodka, gin, rum,<br />\nand sweet &amp; sour, coke for coloring. This merciless affair<br />\nsneaks up from behind and sits on your face.<br />\nNow came the moment of truth. My Host was on the<br />\nverge of his kingship, as well as the edge of his barstool.<br />\nHe had drunk up a river of booze, fed by a score of<br />\nnoxious streams. Just the thought of all that crap floating<br />\naround in his stomach--sour and sweet, thick and watery,<br />\nencompassing every color in the rainbow, every odor in<br />\nSatan's jockstrap--was enough to make my whisky shots<br />\nbang their cups on my esophagus and clamour for<br />\nimmediate release. I persevered, however,and so u:d my<br />\nHost. Weaving upon hisstool like an impatient<br />\nfour-year-old, spasmodically grabbing at passing breasts,<br />\nhe was the very picture of decadent aristocracy. Wasted,<br />\nblitzed, blighted...the Man Who Would Be King.<br />\nOnly one test remained, and that hoary cupbearer<br />\nNoosh placed it before him with infernal relish. By name:<br />\nYellow Jacket and Green Hornet--the two-headed insect<br />\nwhich guards the entrance to the Royal Apartments of<br />\nSelf Abuse. Abandon all hope, Ye who ingest here.<br />\nYellow Chartreuse with one-fifty-one in the former, green<br />\nChartreuse and the same in the latter. Both to be polished<br />\noff while a coin is being flipped in the air. When the clang<br />\nof metal on the bar is heard, the aspirant is either the new<br />\nKing or the Court Jester, El Supremo or just another<br />\ndrunk who couldn't make the grade.<br />\nHe grabbed the glasses, one in each fist\u2014a latter-day<br />\nArthur with his hams on Excalibur's hilt. All was in<br />\nreadiness. A reverent hush fell over the irreverent crowd.<br />\nNoosh's wrist jerked. The coin sprung upwards,<br />\ndisappearing into the subdued light of the lounge, like a<br />\nmeteor piercing the fog. There was the terrible crashing<br />\nsound of glass on teeth, then another, then a thud as the<br />\nglasses came home,and then...only then, the hollow clang<br />\nof two-bits on linoleum.<br />\n\"God save the King!\" shouted Noosh and I in unison.<br />\n\"GOD SAVE THE KING!\" responded the frenzied<br />\ncitizenry. He had done it--my Host was the Big Enchilada<br />\nThere was<br />\nat last. Pandemonium swept the Palace.<br />\nof his<br />\nslapping<br />\ncheeks,<br />\nmuch kissing of his ruddy<br />\nbuy<br />\n\"Lemmie<br />\nof:<br />\nshouts<br />\nbroad 'back, and idiotic<br />\nSomebody wanted an<br />\nthat man a drink!\"<br />\nautograph and one leisure-suiter started throwing money.<br />\nI am proud to say, however, that despite all the uproar,<br />\nHis Majesty's first words were to me. Dimly aware of how<br />\ndamaged his royal brain really was at this point, he threw<br />\na beefy arm around my shoulder, blew a reeking breath<br />\ninto my face and sighed: \"Tell Mom I loved her.\"<br />\nI believe he wanted to say a bit more, but the affairs of<br />\nState tore him away. There was the customary burning of<br />\nthe tab,and, after that, the ceremonial kiss from the<br />\ncocktail waitresses. When it came time to choose a<br />\nmoniker for our plastered premier, I still had mind<br />\nenough for literary puns and, suggested King Tight Ass<br />\nAndronicus.<br />\nIt went right over the heads of the<br />\n\"sounded<br />\nleisure-suiters, but they all agreed that it<br />\nwas.<br />\nregal\" so King Tight Ass it<br />\nI thought by then we had seen the last of Noosh's<br />\nantics for the night, but when things quieted down he was<br />\nPlaying at lago once again.\"Hey Dale...! mean King Tight<br />\nAss your Magnificence, you're the new King alright...but<br />\nfor how long?\"<br />\n\"Whaaaddaayameeen?\" slurred His Grace.<br />\n\"I mean, how long is it gonna be before some punk<br />\nlookin' to make a name for himself comes in here and<br />\ntties to take the crown for his own? Kids today, man,<br />\nthey're on heroin by sixth grade. With all due respect,<br />\nbooze is like soda pop to them.\"<br />\n\"Whaadammayygonnadoo?\" slobbered His Excellency.<br />\n\"My liege,\" continued the crafty Machiavell ,\"I have a<br />\ndrink, that, if you down it, would make your throne<br />\nunreachable.\"<br /><br />\n\"Whaaazzit caaalled?\" blubbered His Potency.<br />\n\"A Black Death Fizz on a Stick.\"<br />\n\"Briinggit onnn!\" shouted the haughty sovereign.<br />\n\"Roy-boy!\" called Noosh,\"render unto Caesar what is<br />\nCaesar's!\"<br />\nI begged; I pleaded; I threatened; but he persisted. He<br />\nwanted to be King for life, and considerations of health<br />\nhad no place in the matter. I tried my damnedest, but it<br />\nwas all for naught. Very well then, very well...The Black<br />\nDeath Fizz on a Stick: Equal parts Southern Comfort,<br />\nTequila, One-fifty-one, Beefeater gin, and Johnny Walker<br />\nBlack.A splash of Apple Jack Brandy and Calvados for<br />\nflavor, a dash of Ouzo for sadism. Pour into a tall glass,<br />\nadd ice,(which, incidentally, melts inside of ten seconds),<br />\nstir in a teaspoon of sugar, top with a twist of lemon, and<br />\nstand back.<br />\n\"Of course, it's a shooter, Your Pharoahship.\"<br />\nYou know, as drunk as he was, and as insensitive to<br />\npain as he was, and as confident as he was-- half that<br />\nsucker refused to stay down.<br />\nFeature that.<br />\nIt so happened that Noosh got the rejected half<br />\nsquarely in his puss (The Sultan of Sobriety had just<br />\nturned his head to congratulate the little bastard for<br />\nsuggesting such an excellent night-cap) so it wasn't a total<br />\nloss.<br />\nThe coronation festivities being finally at an end, it<br />\ncame time to see the Royal Personage home. No small<br />\ntask, I assure you. It was two a.m., and the Law (no<br />\nrespecter of traditions) would soon be cruising by in a<br />\nblack-and-white to oversee the legal bolting of<br />\npublic-house doors. The first conveyance we tried was a<br />\nchair consisting of two Young &amp; Alive flunkies corssing<br />\ntheir arms under the royal buttocks. This failed, due<br />\nlargely to the fact that the bearers were themselves<br />\nroundly soused and unable to get His Corpulence past the<br />\nlobby, where they collapsed into a sandwich board,<br />\nreducing it to splinters. From here on, less dignified<br />\nmeasures were employed to move the Comatose One into<br />\nthe open air. He was half dragged, half pushed through<br />\nthe ornate double doors and onto the cold surface of the<br />\nparking lot, where all movement ceased.<br /><br />\nThe drunken leisure-suiters, refusing to leave the scene<br />\nof so much recent hilarity, clustered about the fallen<br />\nRaja, placing bets on the exact time that he would blow<br />\nthe royal cookies. The problem was a bit more serious<br />\nthan that, for His Majesty, I felt sure, was legally dead in<br />\nthirty-four states. Here he was--the man, who, just short<br />\nhours before, had been my faithful and generous<br />\nHost--now nothing more than a hunk of meat in over half<br />\nthe nation.<br />\nTears came to my eyes.<br />\nPicking up an empty beer bottle, I hurled it to the<br />\npavement. Instantly, the gambling vultures ceased their<br />\nmindless racket and stared inquiringly in my direction.<br />\nStraightening up, to my full,weaving height, and eyeing<br />\nthem with stern determination, I proceeded to recite<br />\nShakespeare's moving and solemn requiem for the<br />\ndeparted Kings of Self Abuse:<br />\nFor God's sake, let us sit upon the ground,<br />\nAnd tell sad stories of the death of kings:<br />\nflow some have been pickled;some slain in bars;<br />\nSome haunted by the bartenders they haven't tipped;<br />\nSome poisn'd by rockgut;some driving home killed.<br />\nAll murder'd. for within the hollow crown<br />\nThat rounds the mortal edge ofa shot glass<br />\nKeeps Death his court; and there the barkeep sits,<br />\nScoffing at his dribbles, and grinning at his puke,<br />\nMowing him a night out, a little scene<br />\nTo monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with his breath;<br />\nInfusing him with vile and tainted hootch<br />\nAs if this flesh, which walls about our life<br />\nWere sponge unsoakable; and plastered thus,<br />\nComes at last with a little gin<br />\nPours through his castle-wall, and -- farewell king!<br />\n\"O000...that's magnificent!\" cried one lusty<br />\nleisure-suiter mere seconds before his head hit the<br />\npavement with a dull thud. There were now two lifeless<br />\nsacks of booze -embalmed flesh on the ground,<br /><br />\nspread-eagled and side by side, pictures of youthful<br />\ndissipation. The Price &amp; Pride of the liquor mart.<br />\n\"Poor Bob's had it,\" said a voice at my ear. \"I guess<br />\nyou and I better get these guys to our cars.\" Nodding in<br />\nagreement, I picked up my Liege's arms and prepared to<br />\ndrag him around the back of the restaurant. The other<br />\n'chap did likewise with poor Bob.<br />\nIt was just then that a figure emerged from, or rather,<br />\nstaggered out of, the still milling crowd, a wad of bills<br />\nclenched in his fist. \"Hey people, _hey!\" he shouted.<br />\n\"Let's have a race! C'mon, let's have a race! My money's<br />\non the King!\" By this time it should surprise no one when<br />\nI report that this sadistie suggestion exacted a chorus of<br />\nenthusiastic agreement from the assembled harlequins. I<br />\nwas ebout to tell them where they could all stuff next<br />\nyear's cocaine allowance, when, to my shock and chagrin,<br />\nthe Shah of Cirrhosis groaned thusly:<br />\n\"Mush!\"<br />\n\"What was that?\" I asked, not quite believing my ears.<br />\n\"Ahh,saad mush, y000 falthy s000n owa biSh!\"<br />\nWell! If I was going to be so shabbily mistreated by the<br />\nman who had ascended to power on my shoulders, then I<br />\ncertainly had no objections to turning his backside into a<br />\ndogsled. If he wanted to crap standing up for the rest of<br />\nhis natural life, who was I to stand in his way? I turned to<br />\nthe leisure-suiter who was ahold of poor Bob, he nodded a<br />\nboozy \"What the Hell?\" and the regatta was on.<br />\nPicture the scene if you will: The parking lot of a<br />\nrespectable French restaurant at two-thirty in the<br />\nmorning. Two hearty gents in the lead, running backwards<br />\nwith all their might, both dragging a supine body behind<br />\nthem. Bringing up the rear, a running, stumbling crowd of<br />\nracing enthusiasts shouting encouragement and. waving<br />\nbills and cocktail glasses in the air.<br />\nWe were about halfway through the clubhouse turn and<br />\nat least three lengths in the lead when I noticed that part<br />\nof his Majesty's jacket which was in contact with the<br />\npavement had begun to smoke ominously. Accordingly, I<br />\nreduced our furious clip in an effort to head off a<br />\nconflagration. No sooner had I done so, however, than his<br />\nDrunkenness began shouting, \"Mush! Mush!\" at the top<br />\nof his lungs and calling me every foul name in his<br />\nbooze-bathed brain.<br />\nLike I said--it was his butt, not mine. I leaned into the<br />\nwind and pulled as if all Goucher was waiting topless at<br />\nthe finish line.<br />\nIt couldn't have been more than five seconds later that<br />\nI heard a ripping sound, andwatched as the Regal britches<br />\nparted company with the royal rump and were instantly<br />\nleft behind like a snake's shedded skin. The debris got<br />\ntangled up in the feet of the foremost racing enthusiast,<br />\ncausing a human pile-up which resembled an open-air<br />\norgy. It was an amazing spectacle, to be sure, but I had<br />\npreciously little time to chuckle, for it was just then that<br />\nthe inevitable happened and my Host's smoldering jacket<br />\nburst into bright,orange flames.<br />\n\"Hey, hey!\" shouted one of the few remaining<br />\nenthusiasts, still stumbling along behind. \"With arl that<br />\none-fifty-one in him, he'll probably BLOW all to HELL!<br />\nHaw!haw!haw!haw!haw!!!

Each gag takes you by<br />\nsurprise and leaves youmore and more<br />\nvulnerable to further attack. Pretty soon<br />\nyou end up in a painfully hilarious state<br />\nthat you can't bear to endure but that<br />\nyou'd hate to end.<br />\nThis weekend's Wonderflix features<br />\nthree Mel Brooks movies-- Blazing<br />\nSaddles, Young Frankenstein, and High<br />\nAnxiety. The first two represent Brooks<br />\nat his finest; the last is a little too<br />\npolished and lacks some of the essential<br />\nBrooks spontaneity. Because his films are<br />\nstructured around mainly physical gags<br />\nand one-liners, spontaneity is crucial to<br />\nthe pacing and, thus, the humor. In this<br />\nrespect, Silent Movie (as the name<br />\nimplies) is a tour de force. Dom deLuise's<br />\ncoke machine barrage and Henny<br />\nYoungman's fly in his soup obviate the<br />\nneed for language.<br />\nBrooks' ensemble of players, including<br />\nMadeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, Dom<br />\ndeLuise, Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman<br />\nand Brooks himself, helps sustain an<br />\natmosphere of spontaneity. Accustomed<br />\nto working together, they share a any,<br />\ninfectious sense of unspoken<br />\ncommunication not unlike the Marx<br /><br />\nBrothers'. Kahn, for instance, pouts and<br />\nlilts her sultry voice in a manner as<br />\nsuggestive and camp as Groucho's cigar<br />\nflicking, eyebrow-raising routine. The<br />\nculmination of Wilder's, Feldman's and<br />\nTerry Garr's search for the mysterious<br />\nviolin in Young Frankenstein ends in a<br />\nfrenzied, fast-paced chase with Cloris<br />\nLeachman's one-line, melodramatic<br />\nadmission that the former Dr.<br />\nFrankenstein was her \"boyfriend.\" The<br />\ncomparatively sparse dialogue fits<br />\nhand-in-glove with the action. In short,<br />\nBrooks' movies pile gag after gag, scene<br />\nupon scene until, theybuild to a climax in<br />\nwhich the audience will believe<br />\nanything--even when s, Blazing Saddles<br />\ninvades a neighboring movie, invades<br />\nHollywood, and finally watches itself<br />\ndrive off into the TV commercial sunset.<br />\nBrooks' constant use of sight-gags,<br />\nslapstick, stereotype, and one-liners gives<br />\nhis movies the tone of a vaudeville show.<br />\nBrooks appeals to comedy's common<br />\ndenominator; most of his jokes concern<br />\nsex, bathroom humor or parody. Blazing<br />\nSaddles, though it includes Madeline<br />\nKahn's seductive rendition of \"I'm So<br />\nTired,\" is basically a bathroom joke,<br />\nculminating in the disgustingly fun ny<br />\nbake d-beans-around-the-campfire scene.<br />\nYoung Frankenstein, on the other hand,<br /><br />\nis almost totally sexual, from Terri Garr's<br />\nconfusion about the \"big knockers\" to<br />\nher willingness to assist Gene Wilder when<br />\nhe asks her to elevate him.<br />\nMany of Brooks' jokes are twists on<br />\ncommon occurrences in daily life or,<br />\nmore often, on common movie<br />\ntechniques. In his later movies, or at least<br />\nin High Anxiety, which he dedicated to<br />\nAlfred Hitchcock, these devices are<br />\nfrequently used. At the beginning of s,<br />\nHigh Anxiety, a woman with a mad look<br />\non her face rushes towards Brooks with<br />\nan umbrella; as it turns out, she is<br />\nactually rushing into her husband's arms,<br />\na perfectly natural action. Later on in the<br />\nfilm, tense music appears to set the scene<br />\nfor Brooks' doubts about the mental<br />\ninstitution's sanity. In a non-Brooks<br />\nmovie, the characters would not be able<br />\nto hear this music (intended only for the<br />\naudience); in ? High Anxiety, the<br />\ncharacters hear it and become alarmed.<br />\nAs a further twist, the characters and the<br />\naudience discover that the music is<br />\nactually being produced by a symphony<br />\norchestra on a passing bus.<br />\nAnother vaudeville technique Brooks<br />\nuses is repetition. In Young Frankenstein,<br />\nfor example, Marty Feldman's shifting<br />\nhump is a running gag (pardon the pun).<br />\nIn High Anxiety, he chauffeur's<br /><br />\nunsuccessful struggles to lift heavy<br />\nobjects while insisting, \"I got it, I got it\"<br />\nlets the audience participate in an in joke<br />\nand also fleshes out the character.<br />\nThough Blazing Saddles, Young<br />\nFrankenstein, and High Anxiety are<br />\nparodies of their respective<br />\ngenres--wester, horror, and suspense--each<br />\nstands on its own as a comic entity. These<br />\nmovies are funny even to viewers who<br />\nhave only vaguely heard of westerns,<br />\nhorror movies, or thrillers. Perhaps there<br />\nis something in American<br />\ncultures-probably commercials and<br />\nsit -corn allusions -that has<br />\nsubconsciously acquainted the public<br />\nwith these genres. In any event, Brooks'<br />\ngenius in parody is in creating gags that<br />\ndemonstrate what they plan to satire a<br />\nsplit-second before they zing in with the<br />\npunch line.<br />\nOddly enough, Brooks' humor, though<br />\nfrequently obscene and vulgar, is<br />\nsimultaneously heart-warming and<br />\nuplifting. Brooks achieves this effect by<br />\nallowing his love, for the object of his<br />\nparody, to transcend his spools digs. In<br />\nterms of his movies, this means creating<br />\nlovable zanies like Gene Wilder's Dr.<br />\nFrankensteinas well as Marty Feldman's<br />\nIgor and Peter Boyle's Frankenstein's<br />\nCont. on p. 17<br /><br />\nMel Brooks<br /><br />\nThe Ow+<br /><br />\nLoi Coxhill<br /><br />\nFederico Feih<br /><br />\nInteresting, But Is It Art?<br />\nBY STEPHEN BARR<br />\nIn December, the 1.11.U. Fine Arts<br />\nCommittee presented British saxophonist<br />\nLol Coxhill in his first American<br />\nconcert.This evening of solo saxophone<br />\nm usic was interesting and sometimes<br />\nfascinating. It also raised many perplexing<br />\nquestions about the nature of music and<br />\nart.<br />\nCox hill calls himself a free-form<br />\nmusician, meaning that his music is free<br />\nfrom any conventionalized restrictions of<br />\nform. To be free \u2022 from<br />\nin<br />\nconventions, though, implies that he is<br />\nfree from the limits of anyi one musical<br />\nstyle, but not from all. His compositions<br />\nshould be a synthesis of many varied<br />\nforms. Coxhill's music is not free-form,<br />\nbut free; he does not work with musical<br />\nforms, only with his saxophone. His<br />\nmusic is an exploration into the notes,<br />\nsounds, rhythms, and combinations there<br />\nof which he can extract from his<br />\ninstrument. It is atonal, and could be<br />\npraised as an investigation into the<br />\ntexture of noise,. but Coxhill can only be<br />\ndefined as a free musician who extracts<br />\nfrom the saxophone, but does not create<br />\nwith it.<br />\nThe nature of Coxhill's tunes, as he<br />\ncalls them, must be improvisational. The<br />\ndirection seems arbitrary, and each turn<br />\nof the notes and rhythms is in no way<br />\nrestricted by our notions of tonality and<br />\ntime. I have never heard Coxhill on<br />\nrecord, but I question whether any tune<br />\ncan ever be duplicated. Each tune--and I<br />\nwouldn't want to call them compositions<br />\nbecause that implies something that<br />\nexisted before, during and after the actual<br />\n\u2022 pc ifor ma lice --was a completely new<br />\nexperience not only for the listener, but<br />\nfor Coxhill himself. The main body of the<br />\ntunes was a furious attack on the<br /><br />\nsaxophone, and he could never convince<br />\nme that out of the randomness I heard,<br />\nthere was an underlying structure,or<br />\nframework, that he was working<br />\nwithin. Coxhill informed the audience<br />\nthat some tunes were based on<br />\nothers--one on Somewhere Over The<br />\nRainbow for example--but for this<br />\nlistener, it was impossible to discern any<br />\nsense of those songs in his music, even<br />\nwith his verbal suggestions. Perhaps<br />\nCoxhill heard these songs in his head, and<br />\nhe would ar ue that his music derived<br /><br />\nthe musical idea, hear what he did with it<br />\nand marvel at his ability to take musical<br />\nform and strip it of its conventions. The<br />\nrest of the tunes were anarchistic<br />\nbabbling.<br />\nCoxhill is not an artist, but an<br />\nexperimenter with sound. lie is trying to<br />\nexplore all the combinations of notes,<br />\nsounds and rhythms possible from the<br />\nsaxophone, and he is not limiting himself<br />\nto one possibility which would constitute<br />\na form. But this is not art. He does not<br />\ntake this formless music and put it into<br /><br />\nAAL.<br /><br />\nKeith Jarrett<br /><br />\nLot Coxhill<br /><br />\nITI14C0<br />\nfrom ordered ideas in his head. If Coxhill<br />\nbelieves this, his music does not work as<br />\nmusic or art. These ideas in his head were<br />\nnot conveyed to the audience through his<br />\nsaxophone. The most interesting part of<br />\nthe tunes was when Coxhill picked up a<br />\nmusical line or rhythm, and worked with<br />\nit creating various permutations of sound<br />\nfrom these pre-existing sequences. In<br />\nthese instances, the audience could hear<br /><br />\nsomecolierent order. Since there is no<br />\nsense of order, there is no sense of<br />\ncreation. Without creation there is no art.<br />\nCoxhill tells us there is order, but he<br />\ndoesn't demonstrate it to the audience in<br />\nthe sound produced. He is missing an<br />\nimportant element of art. My definition<br />\nof art is contingent on a discourse<br />\nbetween artist and audience, and<br />\nalthough art can be highly personal, it<br /><br />\nmust contain this conimunicative element<br />\nin order to work. Coxhill's tunes do not.<br />\nThe most popular contemporary<br />\nartist/musician to Coxhill would certainly<br />\nbe pianist Keith Jarrett. Jarrett is famous<br />\nfor his solo concerts in which he<br />\nimprovises entirely, to the point of not<br />\nhaving any idea what he might play<br />\nbefore he begins, lie does not work<br />\nwithin a framework, but his<br />\nimprovisation is amazingly rhytlunic and<br />\nmelodic. The parts flow together, though,<br />\nand the listener is not alienated by any<br />\nkind of randomness or arbitrariness as in<br />\nthe work of Coxhill. Jarrett's tabula rasa<br />\nimprovisations are smooth, logical and<br />\ncoherent. Jarrett and Coxhill have the<br />\nsame vision and approach to music and<br />\nimprovisation, but there is only so much<br />\ndisorder and anarchy a person can take.<br />\nIndict me for Philistinism, but I refuse to<br />\nbe one who praises everything and<br />\nanything that is different from that which<br />\nis popular, logical, melodic and even<br />\ncommercial. Jarrett's solo music is<br />\nsomewhat disarming, but always<br />\nbeautiful; Coxhill's tunes are sometimes<br />\ninteresting, but always disarming. The<br />\ndifference between 'beautiful' and<br />\n'interesting' is the difference between<br />\nJarrett and Coxhill, and between art and<br />\nnoise.<br />\nCoxhill went so far as to insult his<br />\naudience by telling us that if we ever<br />\nheard a melody, it was purely accidental.<br />\nIf Coxhill believes that music that is<br />\ndifferent will not be melodic, then it is<br />\nhis music that must be indicted as<br />\npretentious. I like very much his<br />\nintentions to explore the possibilities of<br />\nsound with the saxophone, but to<br />\nconsciously disregard the essential<br />\nelements of music, no matter what you<br />\ndo with them, makes his tunes nothing<br />\nmore than meritricious claptrap.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAUt:<br /><br />\nScoreboard For Fav Four<br />\n_<br />\n0<br />\nAt Christmas time, the movie ./<br />\nIAlffl<br />\nindustry shifts into high gear, releasing an<br />\ninordinate amount of new films for the<br />\nholiday movie-going crowd, hoping to<br />\nVincent Canby<br />\ncatch the public's fancy during this<br />\nfestive season\u2014 when otrr defences are<br />\nThe New York Times<br />\ndown.

This season the Blue<br />\nJays are led by first year Coach<br />\nPat Lohrey, who has instituted a<br />\nnew program of conditioning and<br />\ndevelopment. The program,<br />\nbased on that developed at Penn<br />\nState several years ago,<br />\nemphasizes continuous drills and<br />\nround-robin wrestling in an effort<br />\nto take full advantage of the<br />\nmany different styles employed<br />\nby this year's team members.<br />\nDuring the meet at Loyola<br />\njunior Bob Cherry, wrestling in<br />\nthe 118-pound weight class,<br />\n\"started with a pin for six and<br />\nthe team never let down,\"<br />\naccording to Lohrey. The points<br />\ncontinued to pour into the Blue<br />\nJay column, as sophomore Dan<br />\nSussman (126), junior Kevin<br />\nDoring (158), freshman Greg<br />\nHaladyna (167) and Mike Miller<br /><br />\n,(177), and senior Don Hecht<br />\n(190) all scored pins against their<br />\nrespective opponents, while<br />\nsophomore Jack Lu (142) and<br />\njunior Russ Brown (150) earned<br />\ndecisions. Sophomore Pat Owen<br />\ntied for two more Blue Jay<br />\npoints, while rookie junior Bob<br />\nCassilly was pinned in the<br />\nheavyweight category.<br />\nLohrey has confidence that his<br />\nteam will continue to show<br />\nimprovement as the season<br />\nprogresses. They appear to be<br />\ntougher than ever and wrestle<br />\nwell as a team. In fact, their<br />\n\"team identity\" is a major factor<br />\nin the improvement of the squad<br />\nsince last year. Along with<br />\nCherry, the strength of the team<br />\nlies in the weight classes from<br />\n150-177. This group starts with<br />\nteam captain Russ Brown, who<br />\nweighs in at 150.
