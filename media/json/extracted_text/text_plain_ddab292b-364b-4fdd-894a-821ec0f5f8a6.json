Yet, in many cases he receives no reward.<br />\nAs the farmer is to the soldier in time of war, so is the scrub to the<br />\nteam. He is \"the man behind the lines\" who is a measure of fighting<br />\nstrength.

The war brought about a<br />\nstrong nationalistic feeling which<br />\nresulted in amity between the various elements making up each nation.<br />\nTowards the end of the<br />\nwar, however, nationalistic feeling<br />\ndied down and racial antagonisms<br />\nsprang up, bringing pogroms and<br />\nmisery to the Jews of Europe.<br />\nThe causes for such antagonism<br />\nare various. A general desire to<br />\nblame the war on someone, and<br />\njealousy because of the remarkable financial success of Jews, particularly in Germany, are among<br />\nthem. The chief instigators of<br />\nanti-Semitism were the old aris<br />\ntocratic families of Europe which<br />\nhave always been enemies of Judaism. Members of these families, finding their positions threatened by the springing up of republics, and finding that Jews<br />\nwere prospering under republican<br />\ngovernments and even taking part<br />\nin them, sought for selfish motives to rouse Anti-Semitism<br />\namong the people.<br />\n<br />\nrealized by the clubs that<br />\nfirst impressions have a great deal<br />\nto do with reputations and they<br />\nhave been working hard at rehearsals to complete an elaborate<br />\nVernon 4986<br />\nprogram for their initial public<br />\nperformance.

The war brought about a<br />\nstrong nationalistic feeling which<br />\nresulted in amity between the various elements making up each nation.<br />\nTowards the end of the<br />\nwar, however, nationalistic feeling<br />\ndied down and racial antagonisms<br />\nsprang up, bringing pogroms and<br />\nmisery to the Jews of Europe.<br />\nThe causes for such antagonism<br />\nare various. A general desire to<br />\nblame the war on someone, and<br />\njealousy because of the remarkable financial success of Jews, particularly in Germany, are among<br />\nthem. The chief instigators of<br />\nanti-Semitism were the old aris<br />\ntocratic families of Europe which<br />\nhave always been enemies of Judaism. Members of these families, finding their positions threatened by the springing up of republics, and finding that Jews<br />\nwere prospering under republican<br />\ngovernments and even taking part<br />\nin them, sought for selfish motives to rouse Anti-Semitism<br />\namong the people.<br /><br />\nrealized by the clubs that<br />\nfirst impressions have a great deal<br />\nto do with reputations and they<br />\nhave been working hard at rehearsals to complete an elaborate<br />\nVernon 4986<br />\nprogram for their initial public<br />\nperformance.
