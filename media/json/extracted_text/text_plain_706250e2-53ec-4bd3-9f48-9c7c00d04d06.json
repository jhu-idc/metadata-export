It will be remembered by yout readers that<br />\n\\v hen we sailed from Baltimore,<br />\nHalley's Comet was attracting the<br />\nattention, of everyone. We on the<br />\nship had an especially fine opportunity of seeing it. Between three<br />\nand four o'clock on the morning<br />\nof May 13, I got up and went on<br />\ndeck and I was more than paid<br />\nfor the effort. \u2022 The comet was<br />\neast of. the ship, and there were<br />\nno objects to obstruct one's view<br />\nor dwarf it by comparison. Its<br />\nhead was close down towards the<br />\neastern horizon, while its tail<br />\nstretched as a broad band of light<br />\nstraight up the sky, finally fading<br />\nout at the zenith itself.<br />\nThe first land we sighted was<br />\nSan Salvadore, and our captain<br />\nvery obligingly pointed out to us<br />\nthe position of the Columbus Monument.<br />\nAnother interesting sight was our<br />\nview of Cuba. We vent quite close<br />\nto the eastern end of the island,<br />\nSO that every feature of its long<br />\ncoast line was clearly visible to us.<br />\nIn profile, near the lighthouse, the<br />\nhills show a very remarkable series<br />\nof terraces, as evidence of former<br />\nPeriods of submergence of their<br />\nlimestone rocks beneath the ocean.<br />\nIt was surprising to see that there<br />\nwas apparently no beach, the mountains of the interior ending in foothills and a high and very narrow<br />\ncoastal plain which presented a low<br />\nCliff to the waters of the Atlantic.<br />\nThis cliff was perfectly honeycombed with caverns worn in it<br />\nby the waves. The vegetation<br />\nseemed sparse, the country dry,<br />\nalmost arid, and 'the greater part<br />\nof the long coast presented quite<br />\na forbidding appearance.<br />\nWe,or rather, our boat, made the<br />\nacquaintance of a school of porPoises, which romped along at her<br />\nbow for quite a while. One of the<br />\nporpoises was, I am sure, given<br />\nquite a surprise in the course of his<br />\ngambols. He shad gotten off a little<br />\nto one side and had lagged behind<br />\n<br />\nhis fellows a little, when suddenly<br />\nhe made a dart to catch up to them<br />\nand gave his snout a resounding<br />\nthump against the side of the ship.<br />\nThen, too, early one morning, we<br />\nsighted a large turtlejazily floating along on the surface of the<br />\nwater. But we were possibly most<br />\ninterested in the \"flying fish,\" of<br />\nwhich we saw a great many. In<br />\nwatching them we were reminded of<br />\nthe discussion as to how they managed to propel themselves through<br />\nthe air, and we all decided that they<br />\nactually fly, i. e., that there is a<br />\nvibrating motion of the \"wings,\"<br />\nsimilar to that of bird wings. We<br />\nwere led to this conclusion by several reasons: First, there is a<br />\nseries of ripples produced on the<br />\nsurface, such as would result from<br />\na succession of blows struck it a<br />\nshort distance apart; second, we<br />\nrepeatedly saw the fish change his<br />\ndirection of flight, sometimes turning almost at right angles to his .<br />\ndirection on leaving the water;<br />\nthird, the \"flights\" were so long<br />\nthat it seemed to us impossible that<br />\nthe fish could have gained momentum enough before leaving the<br />\nwater to enable him to soar so far.<br />\nFinally, we reached the conclusion<br />\nthat we could distinctly see the vibratory motion of the \"wings!!<br />\nWe were unable to study the<br />\nplankton forms because the speed<br />\nof the ship caused the tow-net to<br />\nbound along over the surface of<br />\nthe waves in long leaps.<br />\nOne of the most beautiful sights<br />\nimaginable was our first view of<br />\nJamaica. Just as the first grey light<br />\nof dawn was showing, we were<br />\nawakened by the pilot coming<br />\naboard, and soon we were on deck.<br />\nAt the side of the ship we tould<br />\ndistinguish the dim outline of the<br />\nnative dug-out canoe and its three<br />\nor four negro paddlers. The canoe<br />\nwas racing along over the water,<br />\nsecured to the ship by a tow-line<br />\nas she steamed into the harbor of<br />\nPort Antonio.<br />\nTo the east, Folly Point juts far<br />\nout into the water, and at its extreme end is the Folly Point Light.<br />\nOn the west, the harbor is protected<br />\nby a large island, and a series of<br />\nreefs between it and the \"mainland,\" so that the harbor is only<br />\nopen towards the north. There is<br />\na very narrow but comfortable<br />\nchannel for the steamships,of which<br />\nthere are an abundance. It is said<br />\nthat Port Antonio clears more ships<br />\nEor American ports than any other<br />\ncity in the world. The town is<br />\nbuilt on a narrow coastal plain; the<br />\n<br />\nFOOT BALL<br />\nU. S. NAVAL ACADEMY<br />\n<br />\nmountains are so close that from<br />\nthe deck of a ship in the port one<br />\ncan distinguish the huts of the<br />\nnegroes on their slopes. Now I<br />\nmust ask the reader to use his<br />\nimagination to its fullest capacity,<br />\nand try to see himself in this harbor in the grey light of early dawn<br />\nand watch it become rapidly brighter and then suddenly see the rosy<br />\ncolor of the sunrise tint the tops<br />\nof the mountains that rise between<br />\nhim and the sun, the light gradually<br />\nbringing out into vivid relief every<br />\ndetail of the scene with its gorgeous<br />\ndress of tropical foliage, the tall<br />\ncocoanut palms telling one that at<br />\nlast he is in the tropics.<br />\n(To be Continued)<br />\nEventful Geology Trip.<br />\n<br />\nLast Wednesday the class in<br />\nGeology I took a most exciting trip.<br />\nIt will be remembered that the<br />\nexperiences of the class were<br />\nchronicled in Tim NEWS-LETTER<br />\nlast year when Dr. Swartz, accompanied by a dozen or so of his<br />\nhopefuls, boarded a boat at the foot<br />\nof Broadway and sailed away to<br />\nHawkins l'oint.

Its<br />\nhead was close down towards the<br />\neastern horizon, while its tail<br />\nstretched as a broad band of light<br />\nstraight up the sky, finally fading<br />\nout at the zenith itself.<br />\nThe first land we sighted was<br />\nSan Salvadore, and our captain<br />\nvery obligingly pointed out to us<br />\nthe position of the Columbus Monument.<br />\nAnother interesting sight was our<br />\nview of Cuba. We vent quite close<br />\nto the eastern end of the island,<br />\nSO that every feature of its long<br />\ncoast line was clearly visible to us.<br />\nIn profile, near the lighthouse, the<br />\nhills show a very remarkable series<br />\nof terraces, as evidence of former<br />\nPeriods of submergence of their<br />\nlimestone rocks beneath the ocean.<br />\nIt was surprising to see that there<br />\nwas apparently no beach, the mountains of the interior ending in foothills and a high and very narrow<br />\ncoastal plain which presented a low<br />\nCliff to the waters of the Atlantic.<br />\nThis cliff was perfectly honeycombed with caverns worn in it<br />\nby the waves. The vegetation<br />\nseemed sparse, the country dry,<br />\nalmost arid, and 'the greater part<br />\nof the long coast presented quite<br />\na forbidding appearance.<br />\nWe,or rather, our boat, made the<br />\nacquaintance of a school of porPoises, which romped along at her<br />\nbow for quite a while. One of the<br />\nporpoises was, I am sure, given<br />\nquite a surprise in the course of his<br />\ngambols. He shad gotten off a little<br />\nto one side and had lagged behind<br /><br />\nhis fellows a little, when suddenly<br />\nhe made a dart to catch up to them<br />\nand gave his snout a resounding<br />\nthump against the side of the ship.<br />\nThen, too, early one morning, we<br />\nsighted a large turtlejazily floating along on the surface of the<br />\nwater. But we were possibly most<br />\ninterested in the \"flying fish,\" of<br />\nwhich we saw a great many. In<br />\nwatching them we were reminded of<br />\nthe discussion as to how they managed to propel themselves through<br />\nthe air, and we all decided that they<br />\nactually fly, i. e., that there is a<br />\nvibrating motion of the \"wings,\"<br />\nsimilar to that of bird wings. We<br />\nwere led to this conclusion by several reasons: First, there is a<br />\nseries of ripples produced on the<br />\nsurface, such as would result from<br />\na succession of blows struck it a<br />\nshort distance apart; second, we<br />\nrepeatedly saw the fish change his<br />\ndirection of flight, sometimes turning almost at right angles to his .<br />\ndirection on leaving the water;<br />\nthird, the \"flights\" were so long<br />\nthat it seemed to us impossible that<br />\nthe fish could have gained momentum enough before leaving the<br />\nwater to enable him to soar so far.<br />\nFinally, we reached the conclusion<br />\nthat we could distinctly see the vibratory motion of the \"wings!!<br />\nWe were unable to study the<br />\nplankton forms because the speed<br />\nof the ship caused the tow-net to<br />\nbound along over the surface of<br />\nthe waves in long leaps.<br />\nOne of the most beautiful sights<br />\nimaginable was our first view of<br />\nJamaica. Just as the first grey light<br />\nof dawn was showing, we were<br />\nawakened by the pilot coming<br />\naboard, and soon we were on deck.<br />\nAt the side of the ship we tould<br />\ndistinguish the dim outline of the<br />\nnative dug-out canoe and its three<br />\nor four negro paddlers. The canoe<br />\nwas racing along over the water,<br />\nsecured to the ship by a tow-line<br />\nas she steamed into the harbor of<br />\nPort Antonio.<br />\nTo the east, Folly Point juts far<br />\nout into the water, and at its extreme end is the Folly Point Light.<br />\nOn the west, the harbor is protected<br />\nby a large island, and a series of<br />\nreefs between it and the \"mainland,\" so that the harbor is only<br />\nopen towards the north. There is<br />\na very narrow but comfortable<br />\nchannel for the steamships,of which<br />\nthere are an abundance. It is said<br />\nthat Port Antonio clears more ships<br />\nEor American ports than any other<br />\ncity in the world. The town is<br />\nbuilt on a narrow coastal plain; the<br /><br />\nFOOT BALL<br />\nU. S. NAVAL ACADEMY<br /><br />\nmountains are so close that from<br />\nthe deck of a ship in the port one<br />\ncan distinguish the huts of the<br />\nnegroes on their slopes. Now I<br />\nmust ask the reader to use his<br />\nimagination to its fullest capacity,<br />\nand try to see himself in this harbor in the grey light of early dawn<br />\nand watch it become rapidly brighter and then suddenly see the rosy<br />\ncolor of the sunrise tint the tops<br />\nof the mountains that rise between<br />\nhim and the sun, the light gradually<br />\nbringing out into vivid relief every<br />\ndetail of the scene with its gorgeous<br />\ndress of tropical foliage, the tall<br />\ncocoanut palms telling one that at<br />\nlast he is in the tropics.<br />\n(To be Continued)<br />\nEventful Geology Trip.<br /><br />\nLast Wednesday the class in<br />\nGeology I took a most exciting trip.<br />\nIt will be remembered that the<br />\nexperiences of the class were<br />\nchronicled in Tim NEWS-LETTER<br />\nlast year when Dr. Swartz, accompanied by a dozen or so of his<br />\nhopefuls, boarded a boat at the foot<br />\nof Broadway and sailed away to<br />\nHawkins l'oint. The intinerary<br />\nthis year was nearly the same PS<br />\nit was last year. A short stop was<br />\nmade at the sulphuric acid plant<br />\non Hawkins Point and then the<br />\nclass followed the shore of the bay<br />\nstudying the physiographic features<br />\nas they went.<br />\nThe Rock Creek boat does not<br />\nreturn .to Baltimore until late in<br />\nthe evening so the /class decided to<br />\nwalk to Curtis Bay and take the<br />\nstreet car from there. The journey<br />\nacross Hawkins Point was made<br />\nat a great speed, the three and<br />\na half miles being covered in<br />\nthirty-eight minutes. It was dark<br />\nwhen the tired crowd arrived<br />\nat the Baltimore Yacht Club's<br />\ngrounds on Curtis Bay. But tired<br />\nas they were they had to row across<br />\nthe inlet to Flood's wharf on the<br />\nother side. On alighting from one<br />\nof the boats a member of the party,<br />\nwho shall remain nameless, slipped<br />\non the gunwale and went up to<br />\nhis hip with his right leg in the<br />\nwater. His spirits were not suppressed however and he joined the<br />\nothers in singing Hopkins songs<br />\non the back platform of the car on<br />\nthe homeward trip.<br />\nDoctor (to Pat's wife after examining Pat, who has been run<br />\nover by an auto)\u2014\"Madam I fear<br />\nyour husband's dead.\"<br />\nPat (feebly)\u2014\"No, I ain't dead<br />\nyet.\"<br />\nPat's Wife\u2014\"Hush, Pat, the<br />\ngentleman knows better than you.\"<br /><br />\nLEFRANC (Sc AULT<br /><br />\nAND-----<br /><br />\nST.
