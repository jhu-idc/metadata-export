The<br />\nreasons for the lack of levity in this final column are two: first,<br />\nyou are preparing for final exams and, short of holding you<br />\ndown and tickling you, there is no way in the world to make you<br />\nlaugh at this time; and, second, for many of us this is a leavetaking, and leave-takings, I think, ought not be flippant.<br />\nIf I have brought you a moment or two of cheer during the<br />\npast year, I ,am rewarded. If I have persuaded you to try<br />\nMarlboro or Philip Morris cigarettes, you are rewarded.<br />\nLet me pause here to express my heartfelt gratitude to the<br />\nmakers of Marlboro and Philip Morris. They have given me<br />\ncomplete freedom in the writing of these columns. There has<br />\nnot been the slightest hint of censorship. They have never<br />\nchanged so much as one comma in my copy. I wish to take this<br />\noccasion to state publicly that I am forever grateful to these<br />\nenlightened tobacconists and I hereby serve notice that if they<br />\nfind it in their- corporate heart to engage me for another year<br />\nof columning, I shall require a substantial increase in salary.<br />\nThe money is not what matters\u2014not as money, that is, but<br />\nonly as a token. I want to be assured that they love me as<br />\nmuch as I love Marlboro and Philip Morris. And what, indeed,<br />\nis not to love? Marlboro is a cigarette which- proves beyond<br />\ncavil that flavor did not go out when filters came in. Philip<br />\nMorris is a cigarette that is pure mildness from lip-end to tipend. Both of these estimable smokes come in soft-pack or<br />\nflip-top box. Neither is ever sold in bulk.<br />\n<br />\nThe summer lies ahead. For underclassmen summer will be<br />\na hiatus, a breather in which to restore yourselves for next<br />\nyear's resumption of busy college life. For seniors there will<br />\nbe no more college. You must not,however,despair and abandon<br />\nyourself to idleness. There are other things to do in the world<br />\nbesides going to school\u2014basket weaving, for example, or building boats in bottles, or picking up tinfoil, or reading \"War and<br />\nPeace.\" Many graduates fall into the erroneous belief that their<br />\nlives are over when they leave college. -This is not so. It is<br />\npossible to make some sort of life for yourself with a bit of<br />\ningenuity...or, if that fails, dye your hair, change your name,<br />\nand enroll at some other college.<br />\nWhatever the future holds for you, be assured that the makers<br />\nof Marlboro and Philip Morris join me in wishing you the best<br />\nof everything. We have taken great pleasure\u2014the makers and<br />\nI\u2014in bringing you this column each week throughout the school<br />\nyear. We hope a little pleasure has accrued to you too.<br />\nMay good fortune attend your ventures. Stay happy. Stay<br />\nhealthy.

It has been<br />\nmy custom during these six years to make no attempt to be<br />\nfunny in this final column. (I have achieved this objective<br />\nmany times during the year also, but never on purpose.) The<br />\nreasons for the lack of levity in this final column are two: first,<br />\nyou are preparing for final exams and, short of holding you<br />\ndown and tickling you, there is no way in the world to make you<br />\nlaugh at this time; and, second, for many of us this is a leavetaking, and leave-takings, I think, ought not be flippant.<br />\nIf I have brought you a moment or two of cheer during the<br />\npast year, I ,am rewarded. If I have persuaded you to try<br />\nMarlboro or Philip Morris cigarettes, you are rewarded.<br />\nLet me pause here to express my heartfelt gratitude to the<br />\nmakers of Marlboro and Philip Morris. They have given me<br />\ncomplete freedom in the writing of these columns. There has<br />\nnot been the slightest hint of censorship. They have never<br />\nchanged so much as one comma in my copy. I wish to take this<br />\noccasion to state publicly that I am forever grateful to these<br />\nenlightened tobacconists and I hereby serve notice that if they<br />\nfind it in their- corporate heart to engage me for another year<br />\nof columning, I shall require a substantial increase in salary.<br />\nThe money is not what matters\u2014not as money, that is, but<br />\nonly as a token. I want to be assured that they love me as<br />\nmuch as I love Marlboro and Philip Morris. And what, indeed,<br />\nis not to love? Marlboro is a cigarette which- proves beyond<br />\ncavil that flavor did not go out when filters came in. Philip<br />\nMorris is a cigarette that is pure mildness from lip-end to tipend. Both of these estimable smokes come in soft-pack or<br />\nflip-top box. Neither is ever sold in bulk.<br /><br />\nThe summer lies ahead. For underclassmen summer will be<br />\na hiatus, a breather in which to restore yourselves for next<br />\nyear's resumption of busy college life. For seniors there will<br />\nbe no more college. You must not,however,despair and abandon<br />\nyourself to idleness. There are other things to do in the world<br />\nbesides going to school\u2014basket weaving, for example, or building boats in bottles, or picking up tinfoil, or reading \"War and<br />\nPeace.\" Many graduates fall into the erroneous belief that their<br />\nlives are over when they leave college. -This is not so. It is<br />\npossible to make some sort of life for yourself with a bit of<br />\ningenuity...or, if that fails, dye your hair, change your name,<br />\nand enroll at some other college.<br />\nWhatever the future holds for you, be assured that the makers<br />\nof Marlboro and Philip Morris join me in wishing you the best<br />\nof everything. We have taken great pleasure\u2014the makers and<br />\nI\u2014in bringing you this column each week throughout the school<br />\nyear. We hope a little pleasure has accrued to you too.<br />\nMay good fortune attend your ventures. Stay happy. Stay<br />\nhealthy.
