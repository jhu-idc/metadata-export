A patch cable<br />\ncan bypass audio system<br />\nproblems. However, a<br />\n\"significant\" amount of wiring<br />\nremains unfinished, due to<br />\nsluggish supply deliveries, French<br />\nsaid.

ON P. 7<br />\nBY MARK SHUSTED<br />\n<br />\nSnow<br />\n<br />\nStrikes<br />\n<br />\nThe cancellation of classes<br />\nTuesday marked the first time in<br />\nthe past five years that inclement<br />\nweather forced the closing of the<br />\nschool. Provost Richard<br />\nLongaker, Dean George Owen,<br />\nand Dean Sigmund Suskind<br />\nconferred early Monday and<br />\nmade the, decision to cancel<br />\nclasses.<br />\n\"We decided at noon on<br />\nMonday to get word out on the<br />\nradio that there would be no<br />\nclasses,\" commented Provost<br />\nLongaker. \"The d cision was<br />\nbased on my expectation that<br />\nmany students and teachers<br />\n<br />\nUniversity officials will<br />\n\u2022 recommend permanently closing<br />\nthe School of Health Services as<br />\nof June 30, 1978 to the Board of<br />\nTrustees at its next meeting<br />\nFebruary 22. Under the proposal,<br />\nthe health associates and<br />\nbaccalaureate nursing programs<br />\nwill continue until June 1979,<br />\n_whenIthe last classes graduate.<br />\nA group of students at the<br />\nschool is opposed to the<br />\nmovement. Members of the<br />\ngroup said that such action<br />\n\"would be potentially<br />\ndevastating, given JHU's<br />\nreputation as a leader in medical<br />\neducation.\" The students are<br />\nworried that a decision to shut<br />\ndown Health Services will be<br />\nregarded as \"a vote of no<br />\nconfidence\" for the physician<br />\nassistant's (or health associate's)<br />\nrole in primary care.<br />\nA lack of funding has caused<br />\nthe school's termination.<br />\nAccording to President of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Institution,<br />\nSteven Muller, Health Services<br />\nran a deficit of approximately<br />\n$700,000 last year. The nursing<br />\nprogram's debt was \"relatively<br />\ngreater\" than that of the<br />\nphysician assistant branch. The<br />\nUniversity funded the<br />\nshortfall. \"The two initial<br />\ngrants from tile Robert Wood<br />\n'Johnson Foundation have been<br />\nessentially spent, i.:nd the school<br />\nhas not in the intervening time<br />\nobtained any endowment funds,\"<br />\nDr. Muller said. \"The prospects<br />\nof getting large-scale external<br />\nwould have a difficult time<br />\ngetting to class.\"<br />\nDeterming whether Tuesday's<br />\nclasses will be rescheduled is the<br />\nresponsibility of Dean Owen,<br />\nDean Suskind, and the faculty.<br />\nDean Suskind stated yesterday<br />\nthat he will leave the question of<br />\nrescheduling up to instructors<br />\nand students.<br />\nAs soon as heavy snow was<br />\nforecast, the plant maintenance<br />\ndepartment called in a crew to<br />\nstart snow removal procedures.<br />\nBob She rholtz, assistant director<br />\nof plant operations, stated that<br />\nthe University had seven or eight<br />\nmen removing snow on Monday<br />\nand Tuesday. In addition, his<br />\n<br />\nfunding from any sources, public<br />\nor private, do not appear to<br />\nvery promising.\"<br />\nThe school is very costly<br />\nbecause of the number of<br />\nintstructors needed to teach 120<br />\nstudents the necessary skills, Dr.<br />\nMuller claimed. For example,<br />\nindividual supervisors work with<br />\nfuture physician assistants at<br />\ntreating patients in tile Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital. The students<br />\nin the School of Health Services<br />\nclaim that health associates rarely<br />\nuse tile hospital, if at all. Instead,<br />\nthey work at clinics throughout<br />\nthe city and the state.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Muller, a<br />\nlarge faculty-student ratio is<br />\nnecessary at the Health Services.<br />\nIn the nursing program, the<br />\nteacher-pupil quotient is as large<br />\n<br />\nas one to two, but in the health<br />\nassociates division, the figure is<br />\nreportedly closer to one to four.<br />\nDr. Muller further said Mat it<br />\nwas impossible to reduce<br />\nnon:academic expenses enough<br />\nto make up the deficits. He<br />\ncommented, \"You can't keep<br />\nthose programs and substantially<br />\nreduce the cost.\"<br />\nAccording to Dr. Muller,<br />\nadditional outside support would<br />\nbe difficult to attract. Many<br />\npossible donors believe that the<br />\nfuture need for physicians'<br />\nassistants is smaller than<br />\npredicted at the time of the<br />\nschool's founding in 1971. 'A<br />\nsurplus of MD's is predicted for<br />\nthe next decade.<br />\nBecause of the small size of<br />\n, CONTD. ON P. 5<br />\n<br />\nPresident Steven Muller<br />\ndepartment- on Tuesday<br />\ncontracted for a front-end loader<br />\ntruck, which picks up excess<br />\nsnow and dumps it elsewhere.<br />\n\"The two roads on campus are<br />\ngiven top priority, then we move<br />\non to the various walkways,\" said<br />\nMr. Sherholtz. \"For this, our<br />\nmaintenance department has two<br />\ndump trucks and a., tractor<br />\nequipped with snow removal<br />\nblades. By now, almost all of the<br />\nsnow has been remo.ved.\"<br />\nThe snow emergency also<br />\ncaused a mix-up among<br />\nUniversity employees on<br />\nTuesday. Many did not report to<br />\nwork because they mistakenly<br />\nbelieved that the entire<br />\n<br />\nUniversity was closed. According<br />\nto Provost Longaker,\"The media<br />\ndid a terrific job getting the word<br />\naround about the cancellation of<br />\nla ses; unfortunately, our<br />\nannouncement was often<br />\nmisread. The wording of our<br />\nstatement was carefully put<br />\ntogether to read 'Classes will be<br />\ncancelled...'. But on the eleven<br />\no'clock news they flashed a<br />\npicture which read 'The<br />\nfollowing divisions of Johns<br />\nHopkins will be closed...'.\"<br />\n\"As a result, there were about<br />\nfive people in Garland Hall, and<br />\nno one in the Dean of Students'<br />\nOffice.

But like the baseball :-.<br />\nrecently proved it cares only about players and fans only so<br />\nlong as it can squeeze a profit from them, the<br />\nadministration move to phase out Health Services shows<br />\nthat what ultimately counts for Johns Hopkins is the<br />\nbottom line on the balance sheet.<br />\nPresident Muller does not even make a plausible attempt<br />\nto argue that primary health care training is not needed in<br />\nthis country. He cites projections that there will soon be a<br />\nsurplus of doctors; emergency room fees are hardly<br />\nplummeting frOm the cutthroat competition. Rather, the<br />\nunabashed reason given for the shutdown is that sufficient<br />\nendowment grant funding can no longer be obtained from<br />\noutside donors.<br />\nIn other words, the Johns Hopkins Institutions declares<br />\nitself to be merely a wondrous instrument of beneficence.<br />\nThrough their munificence, kind men may wield as a tool<br />\nto improve the condition of mankind.

In the past<br />\nand particularly during last week,.<br />\nthe snow has not been properly<br />\nshoveled if at all. Thus, once the.<br />\nfreezing weather approached<br />\nrather ruthlessly, the snow froze<br />\ninto ice, rendering walking<br />\ntr eia,cherous, especially under<br />\nnear hurricane conditions.'<br />\nFurthermore, when the torrential<br />\nrains poured last Wednesday<br />\n(1-25-78), the huge amounts of<br />\nice were converted into deep,<br />\nmuddy floods, such that strolling<br />\nthrough the campus was<br />\nimpossible without being<br />\ndrenched, bedraggled, or<br />\nsplattered, with or without<br />\nboots.<br />\nWe realize the areas ofi<br />\nHomewood campus that must be<br />\nplowed and plowed completely<br />\nare vast and even exhausting<br />\nwhen considering the severity of<br />\nthis climate. However, surely you<br />\nmust be aware of the hazards<br />\nthat an icy and/or floodlike<br />\nterrain present. If you feel that,<br />\nyou do not possess the<br />\nmanpower to undertake this<br />\nnecessary task, might we suggest<br />\nthe hiring of students at minimum wage or under the<br />\nwork-study program to assist<br />\nyou.<br />\nIf conditiols remain under the<br />\nstatus quo, in tile near future you i<br />\nmight find yourself in court<br />\nunder suit due to injury or<br />\nneglect. Many students, as we<br />\nhave witnessed, have fallen<br />\npainfully down( and I need not<br />\ntell you where) flights of stairs,<br />\nslipped unexpectedly onto their<br />\nbacks while just Big-footing<br />\ncarefully through the snow along<br />\nthe road paths, or their books<br />\nhave fallen into enormous pits of<br />\nfilthy ice water\u2014ruined beyond<br />\nrepair and intense studying. Why<br />\nnot take preventive measures<br />\nbefore a serious tragedy occurs?<br />\nShould you require any<br />\n,assistance from the Stuilent<br />\nCouncil in promoting this<br />\nworthwhile campaign to combat<br />\n\"Ice Terror\", you can rely on us<br />\nfor any aid, whatsoever.

We also emptied the<br />\ntrash can so that during the first round of retching there<br />\nwould be some chance of spitting our cookies somewhere<br />\nother than on the floor.

One.might(\"most have expected a<br />\nbattalion of irate dwarves and other Baltimoreans<br />\nPicketing the Lyric Theater on February 5, the evening of<br />\nNewman's first concert in this city.<br />\nFortunately for Baltimore's already-tattered cultural<br />\nreputation, there would be no newsreel footage of an<br />\nanti-Newman contingent crouching behind their cars and<br />\nthen bombarding the poor man with tomatoes as he ran<br />\nfrom his limo to the theatre entrance. Perhaps Sunday<br />\nnight's snowstorm kept the cranks away.<br />\nNevertheless, one entered the Lyric with the feeling<br />\nthat something embarrassing was going to happen. Hyman<br />\nPressman (Baltimore's city comptroller) who also<br />\nComposes doggerel as a sideline, was to present Newman<br />\nwith a special poem in answer to \"Baltimore.\" The poem<br />\ncontains such lines as,\"Thereis no need for us to fret/For<br />\nwe know Randy is all wet...We have a city that is<br />\nbloomin'/But Randy Newman isn't human.\" Rhymin'<br />\nHyman took a front row seat before the concert.<br />\nThe show got off to an inauspicious start when it was<br />\nannounced that the Dirt Band (formerly the Nitty Gritty<br />\nDirt Band) would not play as promised, that evening. The<br />\nentire group had been stricken with the flu. No one<br />\nrushed out to get refunds, however. They were there to<br />\nsee Randy Newman \u2022<br />\nWearing blue jeans and a plaid shirt, Newman came out<br />\nme somebody to love me.\" Between Newman's lyrics and<br />\nto warm applause. As is his custom on tour, he played<br />\nsnide aside comments, the audience spent a good deal of<br />\nsolo, accompanying himself on piano. This may have<br />\ntime laughing as well as listening. The lighting crew also<br />\ndisappointed<br />\nadded a few comical touches. On \"Burn On,\" which<br />\nsome fans (like the two chatty people behind me) who<br />\ncontains the line, \"There's a red moon rising on the<br />\ncame to hear Newman's brilliant orchestral arrangements, Cuyahoga River,\" a large red spotlight rose slowly<br />\nover<br />\n<br />\nNewman and up the backstage wall. On \"Yellow Man,\"a<br />\ntribute to the Chinese who are \"eating rice all day,\" the<br />\nstage was discreetly blasted with yellow floodlights.<br />\nToward the end of his first set, Newman played<br />\nWedding in Cherokee County, the biggest laugh-getter of<br />\nthe night. This was a very clever lead-in to the next song,<br />\nwhich Newman commenced with no introduction. The<br />\ncrowd was still chuckling when Newman launched into<br />\nBaltimore. The silent attention during the song was fairly<br />\nominous. But when it was ended, the audience responded<br />\nwith its biggest ovation of the night. Newman seemed<br />\nsurprised and touched lightly by the reaction. He then<br />\nclosed his first set with Political Science, a song that<br />\nproposes dropping atom bombs on South America, among<br />\nother places, because it \"stole our name.\" Newman left<br />\nfor a 15 minute break, and Hyman Pressman decided he<br />\ndidn't want to stick around for the rest of the show.<br />\nPerhaps the gigantic hand that Baltimore had received<br />\nmade the Comptroller think twice about reciting his<br />\npoem. As he left, someone from the audience hooted,<br />\n\"Bye now! Take care! Don't press too hard!\" Pressman, a<br />\ntrue politician, smiled and waved back.<br />\nNewman returned for a second set and that was<br />\nhighlighted in part by al singalong on Rider in the Rain, the<br />\nsubject of which is an effeminate cowboy. \"You were<br />\ngood on that,\" said an impressed Newman of the<br />\naudience's singing. He followed next with Short People,<br />\nthe opening of which was drowned out by cheers of<br />\nrecognition.<br />\nBecause of the Dirt Band cancellation, Newman was<br />\nkind enough to play 10 more .songs than he usually does in<br />\nconcert, though this still was not enough for some fans<br />\n(like the two chatty people sitting behind me). For most<br />\nof the audience, though, it was a thoroughly enjoyable<br />\n\u2022evening with one of popular music's best composers and<br />\nmusicians.During the instrumental break of the third and<br />\nfinal encore, Davy the Fat Boy, Newman nodded to the<br />\ncrowd and said, \"Thank you all for coming out in this<br />\nweather.\" Someone from the balcony shouted back,<br />\n\"Thanks for coming to Baltimore!\" To which ever-one<br />\nadded appreciative applause.<br />\n<br />\nere is no need<br />\nfor us to fret<br />\n<br />\nFor we know<br />\nRandy s all wet,<br />\n<br />\nWe have a.elly<br />\nthat is bloomingvery<br />\nBut<br />\nRandy Newman<br />\nisn't human<br />\n<br />\nMuseumShow<br />\nand Lectures<br />\nThe Walters Art Gallery will have midday lectures on<br />\nevery Thursday through May 4.

He later revised the<br />\nentries and interspersed them with researched digressions.<br />\non trends in law and legal education. Combining these<br />\nelements produces \"nearly-fiction\", a sort of fact-filled<br />\ndiary. The result is nonetheless successful, a book tnat is<br />\nboth informative and readable. Moreover, quality is<br />\nenhanced by the author's vigorous prose and his abilitY<br />\nto explain legal concepts precisely and inconspicuously.<br />\nAt most law schools, students master these legal<br />\ntheories by comparing the appellate court opinions which<br />\ndetermine common law. Unfortunately, as Turow points<br />\nout, the cost of bringing litigation to the appellate level<br />\nproves impossible for most poor. Concentrating on<br />\nappellate decisions causes inordinate emphasis on<br />\nproperty law and other concerns of the \"privileged.\"<br />\nRalph Nader, consumer advocate and Harvard Law<br />\nSchool graduate, is only one of the legal heavyweights<br />\nwho back Turow's contention that teaching a student to<br />\n\"think like a lawyer\"\u2014the primary task of law school-neglects intuitive notions of right and wrong. Legal<br />\nquestions are reduced to the comparison of opposing<br />\narguments rather than the consideration of alternative<br />\npolicies. One L contains the precious last ravings of one<br />\nnot yet fully assimilated into the legal culture.<br />\nAnother of Turow's more interesting observations is<br />\nthat the exacting nature of the law pervades legal<br />\neducation. Forced to make distinctions among a \u2022<br />\nsingularly accomplished group of students, Harvard<br />\nfaculty resort to inadequate and irrelevant criteria. For<br />\n<br />\nexample, membership on the Harvard Law Review. is<br />\ndetermined not by the ability or willingness to do legal<br />\nresearch but by the first years grades. The grades<br />\nthemselves are so closely grouped the difference in actual<br />\nperformance between a B+ and a B- is miniscule. This is<br />\nmuch tile same problem Alvin Toffler, author of<br />\nFUTURE SHOCK, refers to as \"choice shock'.. Toffler<br />\ncontends that the decision process erodes as people are<br />\nforced to choose among increasingly similar things. Turow \u2022<br />\nalerts us to these and other distressing trends in legal<br />\neducation.<br />\nBut ONE L might easily be read not as a critique of.<br />\nlaw school, but as a thorough psychological treatment of<br />\none man's legal education, or, on a more specific level, as'<br />\na case study in cognitive dissonance.

A patch cable<br />\ncan bypass audio system<br />\nproblems. However, a<br />\n\"significant\" amount of wiring<br />\nremains unfinished, due to<br />\nsluggish supply deliveries, French<br />\nsaid. To accompany the patching<br />\nnetwork, an elaborate switching<br />\nsystem will provide remote<br />\ncontrols for most of the station's<br />\nequipment.<br />\nCONTI). ON P. 7<br />\nBY MARK SHUSTED<br /><br />\nSnow<br /><br />\nStrikes<br /><br />\nThe cancellation of classes<br />\nTuesday marked the first time in<br />\nthe past five years that inclement<br />\nweather forced the closing of the<br />\nschool. Provost Richard<br />\nLongaker, Dean George Owen,<br />\nand Dean Sigmund Suskind<br />\nconferred early Monday and<br />\nmade the, decision to cancel<br />\nclasses.<br />\n\"We decided at noon on<br />\nMonday to get word out on the<br />\nradio that there would be no<br />\nclasses,\" commented Provost<br />\nLongaker. \"The d cision was<br />\nbased on my expectation that<br />\nmany students and teachers<br /><br />\nUniversity officials will<br />\n\u2022 recommend permanently closing<br />\nthe School of Health Services as<br />\nof June 30, 1978 to the Board of<br />\nTrustees at its next meeting<br />\nFebruary 22.

Members of the<br />\ngroup said that such action<br />\n\"would be potentially<br />\ndevastating, given JHU's<br />\nreputation as a leader in medical<br />\neducation.\" The students are<br />\nworried that a decision to shut<br />\ndown Health Services will be<br />\nregarded as \"a vote of no<br />\nconfidence\" for the physician<br />\nassistant's (or health associate's)<br />\nrole in primary care.<br />\nA lack of funding has caused<br />\nthe school's termination.<br />\nAccording to President of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Institution,<br />\nSteven Muller, Health Services<br />\nran a deficit of approximately<br />\n$700,000 last year. The nursing<br />\nprogram's debt was \"relatively<br />\ngreater\" than that of the<br />\nphysician assistant branch. The<br />\nUniversity funded the<br />\nshortfall. \"The two initial<br />\ngrants from tile Robert Wood<br />\n'Johnson Foundation have been<br />\nessentially spent, i.:nd the school<br />\nhas not in the intervening time<br />\nobtained any endowment funds,\"<br />\nDr. Muller said. \"The prospects<br />\nof getting large-scale external<br />\nwould have a difficult time<br />\ngetting to class.\"<br />\nDeterming whether Tuesday's<br />\nclasses will be rescheduled is the<br />\nresponsibility of Dean Owen,<br />\nDean Suskind, and the faculty.<br />\nDean Suskind stated yesterday<br />\nthat he will leave the question of<br />\nrescheduling up to instructors<br />\nand students.<br />\nAs soon as heavy snow was<br />\nforecast, the plant maintenance<br />\ndepartment called in a crew to<br />\nstart snow removal procedures.<br />\nBob She rholtz, assistant director<br />\nof plant operations, stated that<br />\nthe University had seven or eight<br />\nmen removing snow on Monday<br />\nand Tuesday. In addition, his<br /><br />\nfunding from any sources, public<br />\nor private, do not appear to<br />\nvery promising.\"<br />\nThe school is very costly<br />\nbecause of the number of<br />\nintstructors needed to teach 120<br />\nstudents the necessary skills, Dr.<br />\nMuller claimed. For example,<br />\nindividual supervisors work with<br />\nfuture physician assistants at<br />\ntreating patients in tile Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital. The students<br />\nin the School of Health Services<br />\nclaim that health associates rarely<br />\nuse tile hospital, if at all. Instead,<br />\nthey work at clinics throughout<br />\nthe city and the state.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Muller, a<br />\nlarge faculty-student ratio is<br />\nnecessary at the Health Services.<br />\nIn the nursing program, the<br />\nteacher-pupil quotient is as large<br /><br />\nas one to two, but in the health<br />\nassociates division, the figure is<br />\nreportedly closer to one to four.<br />\nDr. Muller further said Mat it<br />\nwas impossible to reduce<br />\nnon:academic expenses enough<br />\nto make up the deficits. He<br />\ncommented, \"You can't keep<br />\nthose programs and substantially<br />\nreduce the cost.\"<br />\nAccording to Dr. Muller,<br />\nadditional outside support would<br />\nbe difficult to attract. Many<br />\npossible donors believe that the<br />\nfuture need for physicians'<br />\nassistants is smaller than<br />\npredicted at the time of the<br />\nschool's founding in 1971. 'A<br />\nsurplus of MD's is predicted for<br />\nthe next decade.<br />\nBecause of the small size of<br />\n, CONTD.

By now, almost all of the<br />\nsnow has been remo.ved.\"<br />\nThe snow emergency also<br />\ncaused a mix-up among<br />\nUniversity employees on<br />\nTuesday. Many did not report to<br />\nwork because they mistakenly<br />\nbelieved that the entire<br /><br />\nUniversity was closed. According<br />\nto Provost Longaker,\"The media<br />\ndid a terrific job getting the word<br />\naround about the cancellation of<br />\nla ses; unfortunately, our<br />\nannouncement was often<br />\nmisread. The wording of our<br />\nstatement was carefully put<br />\ntogether to read 'Classes will be<br />\ncancelled...'. But on the eleven<br />\no'clock news they flashed a<br />\npicture which read 'The<br />\nfollowing divisions of Johns<br />\nHopkins will be closed...'.\"<br />\n\"As a result, there were about<br />\nfive people in Garland Hall, and<br />\nno one in the Dean of Students'<br />\nOffice.

Students at those<br />\nschools will also take some<br />\nOfferings at Homew000d.<br /><br />\nUndergraduates will have to be<br />\nspecially admitted to the<br />\nprogram in order to take such<br />\ninterdivisional courses, according<br />\nto a preliminary proposal. Once<br />\nadmitted, students would have a<br />\nhead start toward admission into<br />\nHopkins School of Medicine or<br />\nSchool of Public Health, like<br />\nundergraduates currently in the<br />\n2-5 program. In fact, the 2-5<br />\nprogram reportedly might be<br />\nphased out after the human<br />\nbiology program is adopted.<br />\nThe proposal is designed to<br />\nbroaden the curriculum in the<br />\nlife sciences, according to Dean<br />\nSuskind, who -also served as<br />\nchairman of the Implementation<br />\nCommittee for the program. \"It<br />\nwill provide an overall<br />\norganizational framework with<br />\nmultiple tracks in the field of<br />\nhuman biology,\" he commented.<br />\nParticipants in the program<br /><br />\nwould not receive a specific<br />\ndegree in Human Biology,<br />\naccording to the current<br />\nproposal. Instead, they could<br />\nchoose from possible courses of<br />\nstudy. Some options to be<br />\noffered would include BA-MD<br />\nsequence, a Natural Science area<br />\nBA-MD with a concentration in<br />\nPublic Health, or a BES in<br />\nBioengineering.

As the<br />\nBirds claim to be loyal to their fans, the University<br />\nprofesses to be a great philanthropic establishment<br />\ndedicated to the cause of promoting world health care in<br />\nclub, which<br />\nany possible way. But like the baseball :-.<br />\nrecently proved it cares only about players and fans only so<br />\nlong as it can squeeze a profit from them, the<br />\nadministration move to phase out Health Services shows<br />\nthat what ultimately counts for Johns Hopkins is the<br />\nbottom line on the balance sheet.<br />\nPresident Muller does not even make a plausible attempt<br />\nto argue that primary health care training is not needed in<br />\nthis country. He cites projections that there will soon be a<br />\nsurplus of doctors; emergency room fees are hardly<br />\nplummeting frOm the cutthroat competition. Rather, the<br />\nunabashed reason given for the shutdown is that sufficient<br />\nendowment grant funding can no longer be obtained from<br />\noutside donors.<br />\nIn other words, the Johns Hopkins Institutions declares<br />\nitself to be merely a wondrous instrument of beneficence.<br />\nThrough their munificence, kind men may wield as a tool<br />\nto improve the condition of mankind. But when enough,<br />\nsuch givers do not happen to be at hand, as with Health<br />\nServices, University leaders showed they have no qualms<br />\nabout washing their hands of any moral responsibil;ty to<br />\nstudents or the public.<br />\nIn these austere days for higher educational institutions,<br />\nperhaps the University's atcitude is justified. But let it no<br />\nlonger stand on higher before the world, reveling in its<br />\nsupreme altruism.<br /><br />\n.

We<br />\nbelieve that the decision to end<br />\nthe Health Associate Program is<br />\nevidence that Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity has no committment<br />\nto primary care. We fear that, in<br />\nview of the reputation and power<br />\nof Hopkins in medicine and<br />\nsociety, this action may set a<br />\nprecedent of non-support for the<br />\nconcept of mid-level practitioners<br />\nin the medical system. As stated<br />\nin our catalog, the program was<br />\nbegun in response to several<br />\nnational issues in health:<br />\ndirficul ties in obtaining<br />\nambulatory health care, the<br />\nescalating cost of health care, and<br />\nfailure of human caring and<br />\nsupportive functions of health<br />\ncare, to name a few.<br />\nWe would like to know, now<br />\nthat the Health Associate<br />\nProgram is being terminated,<br />\nwhat sort of action Hopkins will<br />\ntake to be responsive to these<br />\nissues, and 'to the health care<br />\nneeds of the .people,<br /><br />\nHelpful Hints from the C9nsunter Committee<br />\nBY HOWARD FUTTERMAN\u2022<br />\nConsumerism.

If this<br />\nsurprises you, then consider the<br />\nfollowing questions.<br /><br />\n$75.00 a month food budget. If<br />\nyou overspend on food, it may !<br />\nbe because your shopping skills i<br />\nare weak. If your diet is not<br />\nproviding the correct nutrients,<br />\nyou may be spendingltoo much<br />\non snack foods.

Well,<br />\nconsider your answers to the<br />\nSTICK TO IT! Make it<br />\nquestions.

In<br />\ngeneral, large chain stores can<br />\noffer better prices because they<br />\nbuy in large quantities. Weigh the<br />\nconvenience against the price as<br />\nwell..<br />\n3.

One.might(\"most have expected a<br />\nbattalion of irate dwarves and other Baltimoreans<br />\nPicketing the Lyric Theater on February 5, the evening of<br />\nNewman's first concert in this city.<br />\nFortunately for Baltimore's already-tattered cultural<br />\nreputation, there would be no newsreel footage of an<br />\nanti-Newman contingent crouching behind their cars and<br />\nthen bombarding the poor man with tomatoes as he ran<br />\nfrom his limo to the theatre entrance. Perhaps Sunday<br />\nnight's snowstorm kept the cranks away.<br />\nNevertheless, one entered the Lyric with the feeling<br />\nthat something embarrassing was going to happen. Hyman<br />\nPressman (Baltimore's city comptroller) who also<br />\nComposes doggerel as a sideline, was to present Newman<br />\nwith a special poem in answer to \"Baltimore.\" The poem<br />\ncontains such lines as,\"Thereis no need for us to fret/For<br />\nwe know Randy is all wet...We have a city that is<br />\nbloomin'/But Randy Newman isn't human.\" Rhymin'<br />\nHyman took a front row seat before the concert.<br />\nThe show got off to an inauspicious start when it was<br />\nannounced that the Dirt Band (formerly the Nitty Gritty<br />\nDirt Band) would not play as promised, that evening. The<br />\nentire group had been stricken with the flu. No one<br />\nrushed out to get refunds, however. They were there to<br />\nsee Randy Newman \u2022<br />\nWearing blue jeans and a plaid shirt, Newman came out<br />\nme somebody to love me.\" Between Newman's lyrics and<br />\nto warm applause. As is his custom on tour, he played<br />\nsnide aside comments, the audience spent a good deal of<br />\nsolo, accompanying himself on piano. This may have<br />\ntime laughing as well as listening. The lighting crew also<br />\ndisappointed<br />\nadded a few comical touches. On \"Burn On,\" which<br />\nsome fans (like the two chatty people behind me) who<br />\ncontains the line, \"There's a red moon rising on the<br />\ncame to hear Newman's brilliant orchestral arrangements, Cuyahoga River,\" a large red spotlight rose slowly<br />\nover<br /><br />\nNewman and up the backstage wall. On \"Yellow Man,\"a<br />\ntribute to the Chinese who are \"eating rice all day,\" the<br />\nstage was discreetly blasted with yellow floodlights.<br />\nToward the end of his first set, Newman played<br />\nWedding in Cherokee County, the biggest laugh-getter of<br />\nthe night. This was a very clever lead-in to the next song,<br />\nwhich Newman commenced with no introduction. The<br />\ncrowd was still chuckling when Newman launched into<br />\nBaltimore. The silent attention during the song was fairly<br />\nominous. But when it was ended, the audience responded<br />\nwith its biggest ovation of the night. Newman seemed<br />\nsurprised and touched lightly by the reaction. He then<br />\nclosed his first set with Political Science, a song that<br />\nproposes dropping atom bombs on South America, among<br />\nother places, because it \"stole our name.\" Newman left<br />\nfor a 15 minute break, and Hyman Pressman decided he<br />\ndidn't want to stick around for the rest of the show.<br />\nPerhaps the gigantic hand that Baltimore had received<br />\nmade the Comptroller think twice about reciting his<br />\npoem. As he left, someone from the audience hooted,<br />\n\"Bye now! Take care! Don't press too hard!\" Pressman, a<br />\ntrue politician, smiled and waved back.<br />\nNewman returned for a second set and that was<br />\nhighlighted in part by al singalong on Rider in the Rain, the<br />\nsubject of which is an effeminate cowboy. \"You were<br />\ngood on that,\" said an impressed Newman of the<br />\naudience's singing. He followed next with Short People,<br />\nthe opening of which was drowned out by cheers of<br />\nrecognition.<br />\nBecause of the Dirt Band cancellation, Newman was<br />\nkind enough to play 10 more .songs than he usually does in<br />\nconcert, though this still was not enough for some fans<br />\n(like the two chatty people sitting behind me). For most<br />\nof the audience, though, it was a thoroughly enjoyable<br />\n\u2022evening with one of popular music's best composers and<br />\nmusicians.During the instrumental break of the third and<br />\nfinal encore, Davy the Fat Boy, Newman nodded to the<br />\ncrowd and said, \"Thank you all for coming out in this<br />\nweather.\" Someone from the balcony shouted back,<br />\n\"Thanks for coming to Baltimore!\" To which ever-one<br />\nadded appreciative applause.<br /><br />\nere is no need<br />\nfor us to fret<br /><br />\nFor we know<br />\nRandy s all wet,<br /><br />\nWe have a.elly<br />\nthat is bloomingvery<br />\nBut<br />\nRandy Newman<br />\nisn't human<br /><br />\nMuseumShow<br />\nand Lectures<br />\nThe Walters Art Gallery will have midday lectures on<br />\nevery Thursday through May 4.

He later revised the<br />\nentries and interspersed them with researched digressions.<br />\non trends in law and legal education. Combining these<br />\nelements produces \"nearly-fiction\", a sort of fact-filled<br />\ndiary. The result is nonetheless successful, a book tnat is<br />\nboth informative and readable. Moreover, quality is<br />\nenhanced by the author's vigorous prose and his abilitY<br />\nto explain legal concepts precisely and inconspicuously.<br />\nAt most law schools, students master these legal<br />\ntheories by comparing the appellate court opinions which<br />\ndetermine common law. Unfortunately, as Turow points<br />\nout, the cost of bringing litigation to the appellate level<br />\nproves impossible for most poor. Concentrating on<br />\nappellate decisions causes inordinate emphasis on<br />\nproperty law and other concerns of the \"privileged.\"<br />\nRalph Nader, consumer advocate and Harvard Law<br />\nSchool graduate, is only one of the legal heavyweights<br />\nwho back Turow's contention that teaching a student to<br />\n\"think like a lawyer\"\u2014the primary task of law school-neglects intuitive notions of right and wrong. Legal<br />\nquestions are reduced to the comparison of opposing<br />\narguments rather than the consideration of alternative<br />\npolicies. One L contains the precious last ravings of one<br />\nnot yet fully assimilated into the legal culture.<br />\nAnother of Turow's more interesting observations is<br />\nthat the exacting nature of the law pervades legal<br />\neducation. Forced to make distinctions among a \u2022<br />\nsingularly accomplished group of students, Harvard<br />\nfaculty resort to inadequate and irrelevant criteria. For<br /><br />\nexample, membership on the Harvard Law Review. is<br />\ndetermined not by the ability or willingness to do legal<br />\nresearch but by the first years grades. The grades<br />\nthemselves are so closely grouped the difference in actual<br />\nperformance between a B+ and a B- is miniscule. This is<br />\nmuch tile same problem Alvin Toffler, author of<br />\nFUTURE SHOCK, refers to as \"choice shock'.. Toffler<br />\ncontends that the decision process erodes as people are<br />\nforced to choose among increasingly similar things. Turow \u2022<br />\nalerts us to these and other distressing trends in legal<br />\neducation.<br />\nBut ONE L might easily be read not as a critique of.<br />\nlaw school, but as a thorough psychological treatment of<br />\none man's legal education, or, on a more specific level, as'<br />\na case study in cognitive dissonance. Looking forward to \u2022<br />\nJanuary exams, Turow writes, \"I saw that I should morel<br />\nor less abandon hope of maintaining any perspective..<br />\nHealth, in that circumstance, might well be in excusing<br />\nmyself for giving in... By Monday I felt well enough<br />\ncollected to cancel my appointment with the,<br />\npsychiatrist.\" The author admits that no one at Harvard<br />\nenjoys running at half-speed and the reader infers that the<br />\nresulting competitive rush is like a ride in a centrifuge.<br />\nThe anxieties and neuroses documented here are present<br />\nin some degree at all competitive schools; a Hopkins'<br />\nstudent reading ONE L will doubtless feel the joy of<br />\nrecognition more than one.<br />\nIndeed, it is so easy to empathize with Turow that it is<br />\ndifficult to remember that his view of legal education is<br />\nmyopic. The author comes to law school at, of all places,<br />\nHarvard, and is equipped with more education and a better perspective than most students fresh from college.<br />\nThese factors are bound to differentiate his experiences<br />\nfrom those of other first. year law students. True, most<br />\nfirst year law programs are academically similar, but they<br />\nare not the great equalizers Turow claims them to be.<br />\nIn a successful attempt to make the-reader feel what it<br />\nis to lost perspective, Turow sacrifices the development of<br />\nmany themes. For instance, scant treatment is given to<br />\nthe effect his experience has upon his wife. I found her<br />\nlingering presence in the bLckground irritating. She seems<br />\nto stare over the author's shoulder and yet remain silent;<br />\nAnnette Turow is not directly quoted until well past the<br />\nhalf-way mark.
