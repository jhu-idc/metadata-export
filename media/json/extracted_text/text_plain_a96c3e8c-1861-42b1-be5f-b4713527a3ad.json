The Yale twelve last year showed a very fast attack,<br />\nand as most of this group will be seen in action this year, the jay defense may expect a very busy afternoon.

During the last four<br />\nyears a complete negligence in entertaining visiting teams has been<br />\nmanifested at the Hopkins. Similar conditions exist at other institutions<br />\nat present, but such a lack of hospitality is certainly not to be expected<br />\nat a so-called southern university.

There are a<br />\nfew students on the campus who appreciate an educational talk and in deference to them there should be a few such<br />\nassemblies; incidentally, it won't harm<br />\nothers who are unwittingly inveigled into<br />\nthe auditorium. I recall especially the<br />\nsummary of political and military situations in Europe, the discussion of Russia, the analysis of the vaudeville show,<br />\nand Dr. Harrison's description of missionary life in Arabia. The last two<br />\nillustrate how enlightenment need not<br />\nbe heavy. The magician's performance<br />\nis an excellent example of pure amusement.

G.<br />\n<br />\nWHAT IS THIS? PLAGIARISM?<br />\nNO: PIFFLESCHNITZ:<br />\nEditor of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nIn the January issue of the Hopkins<br />\nBlue Jay there appeared a sketch entitled<br />\nThe Menckens at Home by H. B. Y. and<br />\nC. G. It was an exceedingly clever piece<br />\nof work, and those of us who have<br />\ngrown accustomed to the sterile level of<br />\nthe Jay in the past, prayed fervently<br />\nthat the two capable men who had created it would continue their good work.<br />\nNaturally we were a bit curious. We<br />\nwanted to know the names of the men<br />\nhiding behind the initials H. B. Y. and<br />\nC. G. The editorial page of the Jay informed us that they were Harold B.<br />\nYudkin and one, Chaparral Gould.<br />\nThe virtues of the first are well known<br />\non the campus. The odor of his \"sanctity<br />\nrises up to high heaven.\" But Chaparral<br />\nGould is an unknown. He had never been<br />\nheard of before. Nor would Mr. Yudkin<br />\ndisclose the identity of his collaborator.<br />\nSo we had to sit back and wait expectantly for another piece from this incomparable team of humorists.<br />\nWhat was our surprise, therefore, to<br />\nfind that College Humor recently republished a sketch entitled The Menckens t<br />\nHome\u2014with credit given to the Stanford<br />\nChaparral. We were incensed! .An irreparable oversight\u2014no, an insult! The<br />\nBlue Jay had been slighted. Harold Yudkin immediately became a martyr.<br />\nBut a careful comparison of the two<br />\nsketches disclosed not only startling similarities, but also startling differences.<br />\nObviously, either the men on the Jay<br />\nhad plagiarized those in the Chaparral,<br />\nor thpse in the Chaparral had plagiarized<br />\nthe men on the Jay.<br />\nThe most damning evidence, however,<br />\ncame into our hands when it was pointed<br />\nout that the Chaparral number containing The Menckens at Home had proceed the Blue Jay number\u2014The Chaparral had appeared in October, the Jay in<br />\nJanuary. What was more, a letter received from the editor of the Stanford<br />\nChaparral \u2014 whose name, strangely<br />\nenough, is Burnell Gould, (Chaparral<br />\nGould?), writes: \"I can throw plenty of<br />\nlight on this matter, and do so with<br />\ngreat glee.

G.<br /><br />\nWHAT IS THIS? PLAGIARISM?<br />\nNO: PIFFLESCHNITZ:<br />\nEditor of the NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nIn the January issue of the Hopkins<br />\nBlue Jay there appeared a sketch entitled<br />\nThe Menckens at Home by H. B. Y. and<br />\nC. G. It was an exceedingly clever piece<br />\nof work, and those of us who have<br />\ngrown accustomed to the sterile level of<br />\nthe Jay in the past, prayed fervently<br />\nthat the two capable men who had created it would continue their good work.<br />\nNaturally we were a bit curious. We<br />\nwanted to know the names of the men<br />\nhiding behind the initials H. B. Y. and<br />\nC. G. The editorial page of the Jay informed us that they were Harold B.<br />\nYudkin and one, Chaparral Gould.<br />\nThe virtues of the first are well known<br />\non the campus. The odor of his \"sanctity<br />\nrises up to high heaven.\" But Chaparral<br />\nGould is an unknown. He had never been<br />\nheard of before. Nor would Mr. Yudkin<br />\ndisclose the identity of his collaborator.<br />\nSo we had to sit back and wait expectantly for another piece from this incomparable team of humorists.<br />\nWhat was our surprise, therefore, to<br />\nfind that College Humor recently republished a sketch entitled The Menckens t<br />\nHome\u2014with credit given to the Stanford<br />\nChaparral. We were incensed! .An irreparable oversight\u2014no, an insult! The<br />\nBlue Jay had been slighted. Harold Yudkin immediately became a martyr.<br />\nBut a careful comparison of the two<br />\nsketches disclosed not only startling similarities, but also startling differences.<br />\nObviously, either the men on the Jay<br />\nhad plagiarized those in the Chaparral,<br />\nor thpse in the Chaparral had plagiarized<br />\nthe men on the Jay.<br />\nThe most damning evidence, however,<br />\ncame into our hands when it was pointed<br />\nout that the Chaparral number containing The Menckens at Home had proceed the Blue Jay number\u2014The Chaparral had appeared in October, the Jay in<br />\nJanuary. What was more, a letter received from the editor of the Stanford<br />\nChaparral \u2014 whose name, strangely<br />\nenough, is Burnell Gould, (Chaparral<br />\nGould?), writes: \"I can throw plenty of<br />\nlight on this matter, and do so with<br />\ngreat glee.
