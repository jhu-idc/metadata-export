It hasn't taken any<br />\nstand on the Homewood college, undergraduate dean,<br />\ncomputer, department elimination, employment<br />\ndiscriminstion, minimester and a host of other issues<br />\nfacing the campus. Neither has it attempted to act as a<br />\nfunnel for student-faculty ideas, instead seeming to<br />\nrelish the soft, easy chair of thoughtful inaction.<br />\nSegments of its lackluster career illustrate the point.<br />\nAfter approving the restoration of military recruitment-pristinely worded of course -- the TAC called for a study<br />\nof Homewood's funding ties. In the next three weeks the<br />\ncouncil got around to formulating the committee. Three<br />\nweeks later now, the study still hasn't begun.<br />\nOf course, its major accomplishment was its tender<br />\nrebuke to Dean Benton's plan to ban soliciting on<br />\ncampus. It was so tender, in fact, that the _dean chose to<br />\nattend another campus meeting that day, and now he<br />\nsays he wants to discuss the matter with his advisory<br />\nboard.<br />\nA memo by TAC faculty members the other day tried<br />\nreal hard to push the governance plan -- and thereby<br />\nexonerate themselves from their mediocre job. They<br />\nexplained how they have so many issues under consideration and have so many questions during their 15minute question and answer period. But try as they may<br />\nto sell their effectiveness, the battle was lost from the<br />\nbeginning.<br />\nDuring that first meeting back in October, Benton was<br />\nexplaining, in between brusk organizational pointers<br />\n(\"We'll have an hour for general discussion and then<br />\nstart making motions the last 30 minutes\"), that he<br />\nwanted advice on the military recruitment issue. One<br />\nmember asked him if it was true, as quoted in the paper,<br />\nthat he had already made up his mind on how to solve<br />\nthe matter.<br />\nHis answer was yes, there was a bit of silence, and<br />\nthen the TAC members began -- vainly, absurdly, obsequiously -- talking, discussing, making motions on<br />\nwhat the dean should do.<br />\nThis sham body, mocking its constituents as well as its<br />\nown masculinity, doesn't deserve to exist.<br />\n<br />\nFeiffer<br />\nFOY<br />\n<br />\nHA5 &WEN HE<br />\nA E-105E- OF<br />\npoRPOSE<br />\n<br />\nBy PAUL SCHULMAN<br />\nAlways, it seems, when established institutions are confronted with adversity in<br />\nthe management of their internal affairs<br />\nthey retreat into compacted and rigid<br />\npolicies; they enter into a \"holding action\"<br />\npattern. Institutions do this, no doubt, out of<br />\na sense of crisis.<br />\nBut at least part of this sense of crisis is<br />\nself-generated. Part of it reflects a lapse in<br />\ninstitutional will. When organizations are<br />\nconfronted with internal adversity they lose<br />\nsome measure of confidence in their future<br />\nand in themselves.<br />\nHopkins is clearly moving down the path in<br />\nthe face of its budgetary deficit problems<br />\nThe symptoms are classic: a policy of ecnomic and developmental retrenchment; a<br />\nsense of depression and doom. Yet at least<br />\npart of this response by the University is<br />\nmuch less \"realistic\" than we think it is,<br />\nperhaps even less essential than<br />\npsychosomatic. Some of our \"crisis\" is selfimposed.<br />\nLet's evaluate the administration's<br />\nproposed retrenchment measures apart<br />\nfrom this crisis in institutional confidence.<br />\n1. A ten per cent faculty reduction by 1973<br />\ninvolving the release of selected non-tenured<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nWrong. Hopkins is already too small an<br />\ninstitution for the quality league in which it<br />\nhopes to compete. It is too small to<br />\ncapitalize fully on economies of scale<br />\nrealized by larger universities. Hopkins<br />\nshould selectively enlarge segments of its<br />\nfaculty. This could enhance its academic<br />\nreputation thereby upgrading the quality of<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate students for<br />\nwhom it can successfully compete....<br />\n2. A near \"freeze\" on faculty salary increases and appointments for 1971-72.<br />\nWrong. This is likely to diminish the<br />\nexisting quality of Hopkins faculty if it does<br />\nanything. Once this occurs a downward<br />\nspiral of funding may establish itself....<br />\n3. Reduction in student aid and funds for<br />\norganized activities.<br />\nWrong. This is the very depression cycle<br />\nthe University should seek to avoid.<br />\nDiminished aid means lower selectivity on<br />\nWorse, it means a<br />\nentering students.<br />\nnarrowing of the social and economic<br />\nsampling within the student body. This<br />\ndecline in student quality and breadth would<br />\nlessen the attractiveness of Hopkins; it<br />\nwould reduce its overall importance as a<br />\n<br />\nA f-t0T(vE<br />\ncoMPETE-<br />\n<br />\nAtJP THE WIVE<br />\nTo cl4MB To<br />\n71-tE Top.<br />\n<br />\nnational educational institution....<br />\nIf these policies will only increase our<br />\ncrisis of confidence and add to our budgetary<br />\nproblems over time (and I think they will)<br />\nwhat alternatives to them do we have<br />\navailable\"....<br />\nThe policy best suited for Hopkins at this<br />\ntime (believe it or not) is one that I will term<br />\n\"selective advancement.\" The policy involves three operations:<br />\n1. Absolutely minimize all retrenchment<br />\n2.<br />\nMaximize policy flexibility and<br />\ndepartmental innovation<br />\n3. Consciously direct educational innovations toward new sources of financial<br />\nsupport.<br />\nFirst, all retrenchments must be held to a<br />\nminimum. They attach to the University a<br />\n\"smell of death\" frightening away faculty,<br />\nstudents and financial support.<br />\nInstead, mix with those limited cutbacks<br />\nviewed as absolutely essential a flexible<br />\npolicy designed to stimulate growth in<br />\nselected areas of the University's program.<br />\nThese areas include \"service functions\" to<br />\nindustry (middle-management traineeship<br />\nprograms, conferences on industrial<br />\ntechnology, etc.) to urban and state<br />\ngovernments (\"educational updating\"<br />\ncourses for planners, conferences on<br />\ngovernment organization, urban policy,<br />\netc.) and finally to specific social<br />\norganizations ....<br />\nThe point in all this is that Hopkins would<br />\nbe identifying new sources of financial<br />\nsupport which it could add to its existing<br />\nones. This enlargement of fund sources<br />\nmeans that Hopkins would be less dependent<br />\non a particular foundation or agency. This<br />\nhas policy as well as financial implications.<br />\nThere are those who oppose the \"service\"<br />\nconcept of a University as one which<br />\ndetracts from its overall independence. Yet<br />\nby linking its financial fate to many outside<br />\nagents Hopkins could lessen its dependence<br />\non any one. ...<br />\nAt any rate, the principle notion behind a<br />\nselective advancement policy is that<br />\nHopkins would be led into enlargement and<br />\ninnovation at the very time when its \"crisis\"<br />\nsyndrome might indicate differently. It is<br />\nentirely appropriate for the University at<br />\nthis point to develop new educational<br />\nprograms -- experimenting with curriculum<br />\nand with degree requirements....<br />\nPaul Schulman is a graduate student in Political<br />\nScience.<br />\n<br />\n/F t Parr tfAVE<br />\nENve t 6000.06\"T<br />\nHAVE POuJER<br />\n<br />\nMD I- 1,0001,!4S1<br />\n<br />\nSE e-tiv16-2<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n\u2018A<br />\n<br />\nEVEQ030DY<br />\n61- - WHOSE C,165COF RRPOSE<br />\n<br />\nMOTIVATES THEM TO<br />\ncoHPETE GJITH ME<br />\n<br />\nAl)D alMS r0<br />\n-THE TOP<br />\n<br />\nTRUST ONV<br />\n<br />\n1-1 MAKES<br />\nkoRK,<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\n\fPage 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nNovember 17, 1970<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins: Nowhere To Go But Down<br />\nBy KENNETH S.

Benton. After a<br />\nyear and a half of arduous<br />\nwork, the Committee completed its assignment in June,<br />\n1966.<br />\nThe Report begins with a<br />\nanguished backward glance<br />\nat the terrible troubles JHU<br />\nencountered after its extraordinarily auspicious first<br />\ndecade. \"First in 1887 and<br />\nagain in the 1890s the<br />\nUniversity suffered severe<br />\nfinancial setbacks when the<br />\nvalue of Baltimore and Ohio<br />\nstock, the University's<br />\nprincipal endowment investment,sharply declined....<br />\n\"Although the financial<br />\ncrises of the eighties and<br />\nnineties were eventually<br />\novercome, financial instability remained a continuing problem....<br />\nBetween 1910 and 1956,<br />\nexpenditures exceeded income in 32 of the 46 years. The<br />\n14 years of balanced budgets<br />\n.or modest surpluses clustered<br />\nfor the most part in the<br />\nperiods just after World War I<br />\nand during World War II. In<br />\nUniversity's<br />\nthe<br />\nfact,<br />\nfinancial plight had become<br />\nsuch a matter of course that<br />\nprecise calculations were<br />\nmade to indicate when the<br />\nUniversity's capital reserves<br />\nwould be exhausted.\"<br />\nAs the authors of the Report<br />\nrecognized, this steady<br />\nfinancial drain drastically<br />\neroded the University's<br />\nacademic standing. \"In 1924<br />\nRaymond Hughes, then<br />\nMiami<br />\nof<br />\npresident<br />\nUniversity in Ohio, conducted<br />\nthe first of the subjective<br />\nranking surveys.<br />\n\"Johns Hopkins placed<br />\nseventh. A second study<br />\n<br />\noccurred ten years later;<br />\nHopkins ranked ninth. In 1957<br />\nthe Keniston study, again<br />\nusing peer judgments, placed<br />\nthe University in sixteenth<br />\nposition.\"<br />\nThe mid-1950s, however,<br />\nrepresented the darkness<br />\nbefore the dawn--or so the<br />\nCommittee believed. In the<br />\nten years of your administration, the Committee<br />\ntold Dr. Eisenhower, more<br />\nprogress has been made<br />\n\"than in all the preceding<br />\nyears of the century.\" In the<br />\nthe<br />\n1956-196R,<br />\nperiod<br />\nUniversity's budget tripled,<br />\nand its endowment more than<br />\ndoubled.<br />\nFaculty salaries attained<br />\nfor the first time the AAUP<br />\n\"A\" category. Doctoral<br />\nproduction increased by 40<br />\nper cent over the previous<br />\ngraduate<br />\ndecade, and<br />\nthan<br />\nmore<br />\nenrollment<br />\ndoubled. The intellectual<br />\nquality of entering freshmen<br />\nrose \"spectacularly.\"<br />\nUndergraduate enrollment<br />\nwent up 25 per cent. Nearly<br />\n$50 million in new construction largely overcame a<br />\nthirty-year plant deficit.<br />\nBuoyed up by such<br />\nstatistics, the Committee<br />\nfaced the future with soaring<br />\n<br />\noptimism. \"Only one goal is<br />\nJohns<br />\nfor<br />\nacceptable<br />\nHopkins,\" the Committee<br />\nproclaimed, \"--to be one of<br />\nthe world's great universities.\" The great expectations of the University's<br />\nfirst decade seemed, at long<br />\nlast, attainable.<br />\n\"For the first time since the<br />\nUniversity's founding,\" said<br />\nthe Committee, \"Johns<br />\nHopkins has the luxury of<br />\nresponding confidently to<br />\nopportunities rather than<br />\nsimply reacting to crises.\"<br />\nWhat the authors of the<br />\nLong Range Report fatally<br />\nlacked was a long-range,<br />\nhistorical sense. The upward<br />\nsurge between 1956 and 1966<br />\nwas interpreted by the<br />\nCommittee as a fundamental<br />\nreversal in the University's<br />\nfortunes, rather than for what<br />\nit truly was: a freakish,<br />\n.upward blip on an inexorably<br />\nfalling curve.<br />\nThe blip was produced by<br />\ntwo very special factors.

It hasn't taken any<br />\nstand on the Homewood college, undergraduate dean,<br />\ncomputer, department elimination, employment<br />\ndiscriminstion, minimester and a host of other issues<br />\nfacing the campus. Neither has it attempted to act as a<br />\nfunnel for student-faculty ideas, instead seeming to<br />\nrelish the soft, easy chair of thoughtful inaction.<br />\nSegments of its lackluster career illustrate the point.<br />\nAfter approving the restoration of military recruitment-pristinely worded of course -- the TAC called for a study<br />\nof Homewood's funding ties. In the next three weeks the<br />\ncouncil got around to formulating the committee. Three<br />\nweeks later now, the study still hasn't begun.<br />\nOf course, its major accomplishment was its tender<br />\nrebuke to Dean Benton's plan to ban soliciting on<br />\ncampus. It was so tender, in fact, that the _dean chose to<br />\nattend another campus meeting that day, and now he<br />\nsays he wants to discuss the matter with his advisory<br />\nboard.<br />\nA memo by TAC faculty members the other day tried<br />\nreal hard to push the governance plan -- and thereby<br />\nexonerate themselves from their mediocre job. They<br />\nexplained how they have so many issues under consideration and have so many questions during their 15minute question and answer period. But try as they may<br />\nto sell their effectiveness, the battle was lost from the<br />\nbeginning.<br />\nDuring that first meeting back in October, Benton was<br />\nexplaining, in between brusk organizational pointers<br />\n(\"We'll have an hour for general discussion and then<br />\nstart making motions the last 30 minutes\"), that he<br />\nwanted advice on the military recruitment issue. One<br />\nmember asked him if it was true, as quoted in the paper,<br />\nthat he had already made up his mind on how to solve<br />\nthe matter.<br />\nHis answer was yes, there was a bit of silence, and<br />\nthen the TAC members began -- vainly, absurdly, obsequiously -- talking, discussing, making motions on<br />\nwhat the dean should do.<br />\nThis sham body, mocking its constituents as well as its<br />\nown masculinity, doesn't deserve to exist.<br /><br />\nFeiffer<br />\nFOY<br /><br />\nHA5 &amp;WEN HE<br />\nA E-105E- OF<br />\npoRPOSE<br /><br />\nBy PAUL SCHULMAN<br />\nAlways, it seems, when established institutions are confronted with adversity in<br />\nthe management of their internal affairs<br />\nthey retreat into compacted and rigid<br />\npolicies; they enter into a \"holding action\"<br />\npattern. Institutions do this, no doubt, out of<br />\na sense of crisis.<br />\nBut at least part of this sense of crisis is<br />\nself-generated. Part of it reflects a lapse in<br />\ninstitutional will. When organizations are<br />\nconfronted with internal adversity they lose<br />\nsome measure of confidence in their future<br />\nand in themselves.<br />\nHopkins is clearly moving down the path in<br />\nthe face of its budgetary deficit problems<br />\nThe symptoms are classic: a policy of ecnomic and developmental retrenchment; a<br />\nsense of depression and doom. Yet at least<br />\npart of this response by the University is<br />\nmuch less \"realistic\" than we think it is,<br />\nperhaps even less essential than<br />\npsychosomatic. Some of our \"crisis\" is selfimposed.<br />\nLet's evaluate the administration's<br />\nproposed retrenchment measures apart<br />\nfrom this crisis in institutional confidence.<br />\n1. A ten per cent faculty reduction by 1973<br />\ninvolving the release of selected non-tenured<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nWrong. Hopkins is already too small an<br />\ninstitution for the quality league in which it<br />\nhopes to compete. It is too small to<br />\ncapitalize fully on economies of scale<br />\nrealized by larger universities. Hopkins<br />\nshould selectively enlarge segments of its<br />\nfaculty. This could enhance its academic<br />\nreputation thereby upgrading the quality of<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate students for<br />\nwhom it can successfully compete....<br />\n2. A near \"freeze\" on faculty salary increases and appointments for 1971-72.<br />\nWrong. This is likely to diminish the<br />\nexisting quality of Hopkins faculty if it does<br />\nanything. Once this occurs a downward<br />\nspiral of funding may establish itself....<br />\n3. Reduction in student aid and funds for<br />\norganized activities.<br />\nWrong. This is the very depression cycle<br />\nthe University should seek to avoid.<br />\nDiminished aid means lower selectivity on<br />\nWorse, it means a<br />\nentering students.<br />\nnarrowing of the social and economic<br />\nsampling within the student body. This<br />\ndecline in student quality and breadth would<br />\nlessen the attractiveness of Hopkins; it<br />\nwould reduce its overall importance as a<br /><br />\nA f-t0T(vE<br />\ncoMPETE-<br /><br />\nAtJP THE WIVE<br />\nTo cl4MB To<br />\n71-tE Top.<br /><br />\nnational educational institution....<br />\nIf these policies will only increase our<br />\ncrisis of confidence and add to our budgetary<br />\nproblems over time (and I think they will)<br />\nwhat alternatives to them do we have<br />\navailable\"....<br />\nThe policy best suited for Hopkins at this<br />\ntime (believe it or not) is one that I will term<br />\n\"selective advancement.\" The policy involves three operations:<br />\n1. Absolutely minimize all retrenchment<br />\n2.<br />\nMaximize policy flexibility and<br />\ndepartmental innovation<br />\n3. Consciously direct educational innovations toward new sources of financial<br />\nsupport.<br />\nFirst, all retrenchments must be held to a<br />\nminimum. They attach to the University a<br />\n\"smell of death\" frightening away faculty,<br />\nstudents and financial support.<br />\nInstead, mix with those limited cutbacks<br />\nviewed as absolutely essential a flexible<br />\npolicy designed to stimulate growth in<br />\nselected areas of the University's program.<br />\nThese areas include \"service functions\" to<br />\nindustry (middle-management traineeship<br />\nprograms, conferences on industrial<br />\ntechnology, etc.) to urban and state<br />\ngovernments (\"educational updating\"<br />\ncourses for planners, conferences on<br />\ngovernment organization, urban policy,<br />\netc.) and finally to specific social<br />\norganizations ....<br />\nThe point in all this is that Hopkins would<br />\nbe identifying new sources of financial<br />\nsupport which it could add to its existing<br />\nones. This enlargement of fund sources<br />\nmeans that Hopkins would be less dependent<br />\non a particular foundation or agency. This<br />\nhas policy as well as financial implications.<br />\nThere are those who oppose the \"service\"<br />\nconcept of a University as one which<br />\ndetracts from its overall independence. Yet<br />\nby linking its financial fate to many outside<br />\nagents Hopkins could lessen its dependence<br />\non any one. ...<br />\nAt any rate, the principle notion behind a<br />\nselective advancement policy is that<br />\nHopkins would be led into enlargement and<br />\ninnovation at the very time when its \"crisis\"<br />\nsyndrome might indicate differently. It is<br />\nentirely appropriate for the University at<br />\nthis point to develop new educational<br />\nprograms -- experimenting with curriculum<br />\nand with degree requirements....<br />\nPaul Schulman is a graduate student in Political<br />\nScience.<br /><br />\n/F t Parr tfAVE<br />\nENve t 6000.06\"T<br />\nHAVE POuJER<br /><br />\nMD I- 1,0001,!4S1<br /><br />\nSE e-tiv16-2<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n'<br />\n\u2018A<br /><br />\nEVEQ030DY<br />\n61- - WHOSE C,165COF RRPOSE<br /><br />\nMOTIVATES THEM TO<br />\ncoHPETE GJITH ME<br /><br />\nAl)D alMS r0<br />\n-THE TOP<br /><br />\nTRUST ONV<br /><br />\n1-1 MAKES<br />\nkoRK,<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nPage 7<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nNovember 17, 1970<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins: Nowhere To Go But Down<br />\nBy KENNETH S. LYNN<br /><br />\nREPORT OF THE LONG<br />\nPLANNING<br />\nRANGE<br />\nCOMMITTEE TO THE<br />\nBaltimore,<br />\nPRESIDENT,<br />\n1966. 223 pp.<br />\nThe Long Range Planning<br />\nCommittee was established in<br />\nOctober, 1964, to assist<br />\nPresident Milton Eisenhower<br />\nin making \"a careful<br />\nassessment of the future<br />\ncourse of the University.\"<br />\nThe Committee was chaired<br />\nby Professor William D.<br />\nMcElroy, and included such<br />\nwell-known personalities as<br />\nGeorge S. Benton. After a<br />\nyear and a half of arduous<br />\nwork, the Committee completed its assignment in June,<br />\n1966.<br />\nThe Report begins with a<br />\nanguished backward glance<br />\nat the terrible troubles JHU<br />\nencountered after its extraordinarily auspicious first<br />\ndecade. \"First in 1887 and<br />\nagain in the 1890s the<br />\nUniversity suffered severe<br />\nfinancial setbacks when the<br />\nvalue of Baltimore and Ohio<br />\nstock, the University's<br />\nprincipal endowment investment,sharply declined....<br />\n\"Although the financial<br />\ncrises of the eighties and<br />\nnineties were eventually<br />\novercome, financial instability remained a continuing problem....<br />\nBetween 1910 and 1956,<br />\nexpenditures exceeded income in 32 of the 46 years. The<br />\n14 years of balanced budgets<br />\n.or modest surpluses clustered<br />\nfor the most part in the<br />\nperiods just after World War I<br />\nand during World War II. In<br />\nUniversity's<br />\nthe<br />\nfact,<br />\nfinancial plight had become<br />\nsuch a matter of course that<br />\nprecise calculations were<br />\nmade to indicate when the<br />\nUniversity's capital reserves<br />\nwould be exhausted.\"<br />\nAs the authors of the Report<br />\nrecognized, this steady<br />\nfinancial drain drastically<br />\neroded the University's<br />\nacademic standing. \"In 1924<br />\nRaymond Hughes, then<br />\nMiami<br />\nof<br />\npresident<br />\nUniversity in Ohio, conducted<br />\nthe first of the subjective<br />\nranking surveys.<br />\n\"Johns Hopkins placed<br />\nseventh. A second study<br /><br />\noccurred ten years later;<br />\nHopkins ranked ninth. In 1957<br />\nthe Keniston study, again<br />\nusing peer judgments, placed<br />\nthe University in sixteenth<br />\nposition.\"<br />\nThe mid-1950s, however,<br />\nrepresented the darkness<br />\nbefore the dawn--or so the<br />\nCommittee believed. In the<br />\nten years of your administration, the Committee<br />\ntold Dr. Eisenhower, more<br />\nprogress has been made<br />\n\"than in all the preceding<br />\nyears of the century.\" In the<br />\nthe<br />\n1956-196R,<br />\nperiod<br />\nUniversity's budget tripled,<br />\nand its endowment more than<br />\ndoubled.<br />\nFaculty salaries attained<br />\nfor the first time the AAUP<br />\n\"A\" category. Doctoral<br />\nproduction increased by 40<br />\nper cent over the previous<br />\ngraduate<br />\ndecade, and<br />\nthan<br />\nmore<br />\nenrollment<br />\ndoubled. The intellectual<br />\nquality of entering freshmen<br />\nrose \"spectacularly.\"<br />\nUndergraduate enrollment<br />\nwent up 25 per cent. Nearly<br />\n$50 million in new construction largely overcame a<br />\nthirty-year plant deficit.<br />\nBuoyed up by such<br />\nstatistics, the Committee<br />\nfaced the future with soaring<br /><br />\noptimism. \"Only one goal is<br />\nJohns<br />\nfor<br />\nacceptable<br />\nHopkins,\" the Committee<br />\nproclaimed, \"--to be one of<br />\nthe world's great universities.\" The great expectations of the University's<br />\nfirst decade seemed, at long<br />\nlast, attainable.<br />\n\"For the first time since the<br />\nUniversity's founding,\" said<br />\nthe Committee, \"Johns<br />\nHopkins has the luxury of<br />\nresponding confidently to<br />\nopportunities rather than<br />\nsimply reacting to crises.\"<br />\nWhat the authors of the<br />\nLong Range Report fatally<br />\nlacked was a long-range,<br />\nhistorical sense. The upward<br />\nsurge between 1956 and 1966<br />\nwas interpreted by the<br />\nCommittee as a fundamental<br />\nreversal in the University's<br />\nfortunes, rather than for what<br />\nit truly was: a freakish,<br />\n.upward blip on an inexorably<br />\nfalling curve.<br />\nThe blip was produced by<br />\ntwo very special factors. The<br />\nfirst was the election to the<br />\n-Hopkins presidency in 1956 of<br />\na very gifted administrator<br />\nwho also happened to be the<br />\nbrother of Dwight D.<br />\nEisenhower. The business<br />\ncommunity of the United<br />\nGeneral<br />\nStates adored<br /><br />\nlEisenhower, not only because<br />\nhe had led the Allies to victory in the ETO, but because<br />\nhe had led the Republicans to<br />\nvictory, after twenty years of<br />\ndefeat.<br />\nConsequently, business<br />\ntycoons who had always<br />\nthought that Johns Hopkins<br />\nwas the name of a hospital<br />\ngave generously to the<br />\nHomewood campus, simply<br />\nbecause it was Ike's brother<br />\nwho was asking them to do so.<br />\nThe second factor was<br />\nSputnik, which was launched<br />\non October 4, 1957. In<br />\n!galvanic response, the U.S.<br />\nCongress launched a sort of<br />\nnon-stop New Year's Eve<br />\nparty for American science,<br />\n,\u2022 with the result that the<br />\nscientists at JHU were able to<br />\n!assemble the colleagues, the<br />\ngraduate students and the<br />\nlabs that they had always<br />\ndreamed of.
