A few were disappointed. Most just didn't seem<br />\nto care. It would have been nice to hear a presidential<br />\ncandidate, especially one who is apparently the prophet<br />\nof a philosophy that seems alien to the consensus that<br />\nhas governed this country for the last 20 years.<br />\nIt would have been nice, but not vitally important;<br />\nfor Senator Goldwater apparently would have little to<br />\nsay to an academic group. His campaign is aimed at<br />\nstimulating emotion rather than thought.<br />\nAll problems can he solved by firm will and moral<br />\nleadership, or so Senator Goldwater would have us believe. For example, he and other Republicans imply<br />\nthat if the Senator were elected he would use his moral<br />\nleadership and firm will to eradicate crime throughout the<br />\nnation. We would find Republican pleas (they cannot<br />\nbe called arguments, for reason is the essence of argument) more appealing if Senator Goldwater had used<br />\nhis moral leadership in his own state of Arizona; but<br />\nPhoenix, the state capital, has one of the highest crime<br />\nrates in the nation.<br />\nSenator Goldwater is not without some virtues,<br />\nhowever (He does look good riding a horse.). The<br />\nsame cannot be said of his running mate, Representative<br />\nWilliam Miller. Miller is known as a \"gut-fighter,\" a<br />\nterm applied to those who, having neither ideas of their<br />\nown nor the ability to comprehend the ideas of others,<br />\nmake their way in the world by attacking the evil traits,<br />\nreal and imagined, of their opponents. Miller does deserve some sympathy, for he is faced with the onerous<br />\ntasks of defending Senator Goldwater's indefensible<br />\npositions.<br />\nSenator Goldwater and Miller have had the advantage of the counsel of Dean Burch, the Republican<br />\nNational Committee Chairman. Burch will best be remembered for his performance following President<br />\nJohnson's televised address last Sunday. In making his<br />\ninvalid demands for equal time, Burch acted somewhat<br />\nEke a six year old who had had his lollipop taken away.<br />\nWe would suggest that Burch's lollipop be returned immediately; even he would find it hard to talk with a<br />\nlollipop in his mouth.<br />\nSenator Goldwater, Miller, and Burch are by no<br />\nmeans the strangest Republicans around. Earlier this<br />\nweek a citizens for Goldwater committee made known<br />\nMa plans for a film that would document the moral<br />\ndecline of the nation under the Democratic party. As<br />\nexamples of the decline in our moral fibre, the Repubbeans planned to include shots of strip-tease dancers<br />\nand topless bathing suits. It must sound odd, but in our<br />\nblissful undergraduate ignorance, we had thought that<br />\nstrip-teasers were around long before 1960. In any case,<br />\nM the Republicans can prove that Democrats are responsible for strip-tease dances and topless bathing suits,<br />\ndie Democrats will have the News-Letter endorsement.<br />\nThese 1964 Republicans sure are a \"curious crew.\"<br />\n<br />\nGoldman's View<br />\nWith Eric Goldman scheduled to speak here Sunday, The editors felt it appropriate to reprint an excerpt of a column written by Dr. Goldman for the<br />\nJanuary 22, 1934 News-Letter.

The sparse dialogue and fast<br />\npace, the economy of means, the<br />\nquick, direct action, and the interest in machines in motion are<br />\nall reminiscent of the films of<br />\nHawks and Ford. To find a<br />\nfrontier, that unique combination of open space and hostile<br />\nenvironment, De Broca went to<br />\n<br />\nBrazil (as previously Hawks had<br />\ngone to Africa to film Hatari<br />\nand Huston to Mexico to film<br />\nThe Treasure of Sierra Madre);<br />\ndiscovering in the dry plains, the<br />\nrugged, jerry-built towns, and<br />\nthe jungle the equivalent of the<br />\nAmerican frontier. There is also<br />\na saloon brawl that is equal in<br />\nviolence, duration, and humor to<br />\nany ever filmed in the Hollywood<br />\nwest.<br />\nBelmont% and Dorleac<br />\nThe acting in the film is excellent. Belmondo. as the soldier<br />\nwhose fiancee is kidnapped, is<br />\nperfectly cast; physically believable in the part, he performs<br />\nwith inspiration and energy.<br />\nWalking, running, swimming,<br />\nfighting, wrecking, motorcycles,<br />\ndragged behind boats, and bailing out of airplanes he is persistent, tireless, and brave. Francoise Dorleac, as the fiancee he<br />\ntwice rescues from thieves, is<br />\neverything one could wish. She<br />\nis young and innocent, wonderfully beautiful, and the epitome<br />\nof grace and style. Jean Servais<br />\nas the museum director is suitably refined and corrupt.<br />\nTechnical<br />\nThe color photography by<br />\nRaoul Coutard has depth, clarity, and real feeling for composition and design; it is the most<br />\ncreative I have seen since Black<br />\nOrpheus. Tight editing and numerous tracking shots contribute<br />\nto the film's fast pace and sense<br />\nof continuous motion.

A few were disappointed. Most just didn't seem<br />\nto care. It would have been nice to hear a presidential<br />\ncandidate, especially one who is apparently the prophet<br />\nof a philosophy that seems alien to the consensus that<br />\nhas governed this country for the last 20 years.<br />\nIt would have been nice, but not vitally important;<br />\nfor Senator Goldwater apparently would have little to<br />\nsay to an academic group. His campaign is aimed at<br />\nstimulating emotion rather than thought.<br />\nAll problems can he solved by firm will and moral<br />\nleadership, or so Senator Goldwater would have us believe. For example, he and other Republicans imply<br />\nthat if the Senator were elected he would use his moral<br />\nleadership and firm will to eradicate crime throughout the<br />\nnation. We would find Republican pleas (they cannot<br />\nbe called arguments, for reason is the essence of argument) more appealing if Senator Goldwater had used<br />\nhis moral leadership in his own state of Arizona; but<br />\nPhoenix, the state capital, has one of the highest crime<br />\nrates in the nation.<br />\nSenator Goldwater is not without some virtues,<br />\nhowever (He does look good riding a horse.). The<br />\nsame cannot be said of his running mate, Representative<br />\nWilliam Miller. Miller is known as a \"gut-fighter,\" a<br />\nterm applied to those who, having neither ideas of their<br />\nown nor the ability to comprehend the ideas of others,<br />\nmake their way in the world by attacking the evil traits,<br />\nreal and imagined, of their opponents. Miller does deserve some sympathy, for he is faced with the onerous<br />\ntasks of defending Senator Goldwater's indefensible<br />\npositions.<br />\nSenator Goldwater and Miller have had the advantage of the counsel of Dean Burch, the Republican<br />\nNational Committee Chairman. Burch will best be remembered for his performance following President<br />\nJohnson's televised address last Sunday. In making his<br />\ninvalid demands for equal time, Burch acted somewhat<br />\nEke a six year old who had had his lollipop taken away.<br />\nWe would suggest that Burch's lollipop be returned immediately; even he would find it hard to talk with a<br />\nlollipop in his mouth.<br />\nSenator Goldwater, Miller, and Burch are by no<br />\nmeans the strangest Republicans around. Earlier this<br />\nweek a citizens for Goldwater committee made known<br />\nMa plans for a film that would document the moral<br />\ndecline of the nation under the Democratic party. As<br />\nexamples of the decline in our moral fibre, the Repubbeans planned to include shots of strip-tease dancers<br />\nand topless bathing suits. It must sound odd, but in our<br />\nblissful undergraduate ignorance, we had thought that<br />\nstrip-teasers were around long before 1960. In any case,<br />\nM the Republicans can prove that Democrats are responsible for strip-tease dances and topless bathing suits,<br />\ndie Democrats will have the News-Letter endorsement.<br />\nThese 1964 Republicans sure are a \"curious crew.\"<br /><br />\nGoldman's View<br />\nWith Eric Goldman scheduled to speak here Sunday, The editors felt it appropriate to reprint an excerpt of a column written by Dr. Goldman for the<br />\nJanuary 22, 1934 News-Letter.

In terms of any kind<br />\nof Progress, the revival of interest in libertarian ideals, characteristic of today's Conservatives, cannot be misconstrued as<br />\na return to the Past.

Paris has been<br />\nreplaced by the wilds of Brazil,<br />\nleisurely pace changed to breakneck speed, and elements of the<br />\nchase, mystery, and suspense<br />\nadded to romance. With a small<br />\ncast and high good humor De<br />\nBroca has produced what Stanley Kramer, 23 comedians, and<br />\nthe giant screen of Its a Mad,<br />\nMad, Mad, Mad, Mad world<br />\ncould not: a film that never sits<br />\nstill, that is light, exciting, and<br />\nexceptionally funny. In Kramer's<br />\nfilm, action is motivated, and<br />\ncharacter corrupted, by universal<br />\ngreed; in Rio, action is motivated by love. The journey of<br />\nthe lovers, from her pleasant<br />\nhome in Paris to the heart of<br />\nthe Brazilian jungle, is essentially a journey into love; the further fromthe distractions of civilization and the greater their<br />\ndanger, the more fully is their<br />\nlove realized.<br />\nThe New West<br />\nThe story is concerned with<br />\nthe theft of a Brazilian statue<br />\nfrom a museum in Paris (one of<br />\nthree such statues), the kidnapping of the museum's director<br />\n(who knows the secret of the<br />\nstatues), the kidnapping of a<br />\nyoung woman (who knows the<br />\nlocation of the second statue),<br />\nthe hunt for a Brazilian millionaire who has the third statue),<br />\nand a series of chases that extend from Paris to Rio to Brazilia<br />\nto a river port in the interior<br />\nto a jungle waterfall.<br />\nThe film is largely derived in<br />\nstyle and theme from American<br />\npictures; there is nothing in<br />\nFrench film history that suggests<br />\nit. The sparse dialogue and fast<br />\npace, the economy of means, the<br />\nquick, direct action, and the interest in machines in motion are<br />\nall reminiscent of the films of<br />\nHawks and Ford. To find a<br />\nfrontier, that unique combination of open space and hostile<br />\nenvironment, De Broca went to<br /><br />\nBrazil (as previously Hawks had<br />\ngone to Africa to film Hatari<br />\nand Huston to Mexico to film<br />\nThe Treasure of Sierra Madre);<br />\ndiscovering in the dry plains, the<br />\nrugged, jerry-built towns, and<br />\nthe jungle the equivalent of the<br />\nAmerican frontier. There is also<br />\na saloon brawl that is equal in<br />\nviolence, duration, and humor to<br />\nany ever filmed in the Hollywood<br />\nwest.<br />\nBelmont% and Dorleac<br />\nThe acting in the film is excellent.

Francoise Dorleac, as the fiancee he<br />\ntwice rescues from thieves, is<br />\neverything one could wish.
