Before the U.S.<br />\nentered World War I, only a<br />\nfew men left Hopkins early to<br />\nfight, but the students did request that a course in military<br />\ntraining be offered. The<br />\ncourse was established in<br />\n1916, and it was made clear<br />\nthat Hopkins did not \"believe<br />\nthis country was on the eve of<br />\nwar but that Ho kin'<br />\n<br />\nIN THE FOLD<br />\nThe Inei\u2022itable<br />\nPart<br />\nLife<br />\nHophins:<br />\nSophomore Slump<br />\n<br />\naround the world.\"<br />\nPre-World War II Hopkins<br />\nstudents were not as inclined<br />\nto promote the war effort.<br />\nThe nation was just recovering from the Depression, and<br />\nthe sentiment was towards remaining neutral.

The resolution has been endorsed by the<br />\nStudent Council and it will next<br />\nbe considered by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies<br />\n(CUS).<br />\nTim Gilbreath, chairman of<br />\nthe Education Committee, cites<br />\ntwo major reasons for such<br />\ncriteria. \"We are paying for<br />\n[the T.A.s] to provide a service,<br />\nwhich they cannot provide if<br />\nthey can't speak English, and if<br />\n[a T.A.] cannot speak, he is ineffective at teaching.\" The<br />\nEducation Committee decided<br />\nthat the solution to the problem<br />\nwould be to have the University administer verbal proficiency exams. The administration<br />\nwould then decic.le what to do<br />\nwith the results of the exams.<br />\nGilbreath insists that these exams would not be a part of the<br />\nbasic graduate school application, but would only be given to<br />\nforeign students to determine if<br />\nthey could be T.A.s.<br />\nThis solution is not without<br />\nits own problems. One of its<br />\nmajor ones is that a Universityadministered exam would conflict with the autonomy of individual departments. Lucien<br />\nBrush, Associate Dean of<br />\nUndergraduate and Graduate<br />\nStudies, and Mike Burka,<br />\nchairman of the Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization,<br />\nboth agree that the best way to<br />\nattack the problem is through<br />\nthe departmental chairmen.<br />\nBurka says that University-wide<br />\nregulations can be \"terribly<br />\nrigid and inflexible.\" He adds,<br />\n\"The GRO thinks that the<br />\ndepartmental chairmen should<br />\nbe responsible in seeing that no<br />\nstudent should suffer.\" Dean<br />\nBrush is concerned about what<br />\na department should do it' a<br />\nT.A. does not pass a verbal<br />\ntest, since many departments<br />\nhave a very limited supply of<br />\ngraduate students. He feels that<br />\n\"valid and logical\" complaints<br />\nto the departmental chairmen<br />\nwill be effective in dealing with<br />\nthe problem.<br />\nThere are two other problems with the proposed exams,<br />\naccording to Gilbreath.

The<br />\nStudent Council Education Committee's efforts to ameliorate this problem are<br />\ncommendable.<br />\nThe News-Letter believes that several important steps must he taken to alleviate this<br />\nproblem, Firstly, the responsibility for ensuring proper communication skills of<br />\nteaching assistants must be clearly defined.<br />\nSomeone has to be held accountable for a<br />\nteaching assistant that cannot speak English.<br />\nThis responsibility should rest with the<br />\ndepartments, although there must also be<br />\nsome general University oversight.<br />\nIn almost all other aspects of their<br />\nacademic tenure at Hopkins, the departments are responsible for their graduate<br />\nstudents. They should also be responsible for<br />\nsetting communication standards for their<br />\nteaching assistants. This makes sense since<br />\ndifferent departments may require different<br />\ndegrees of proficiency. An English or<br />\nHistory teaching assistant needs a better<br />\ngrasp of the language than one in the<br />\nMathematics department.<br />\nProficiency should be determined by a verbal exam, as recommended by the Student<br />\nCouncil Education Committee. It should be<br />\nadministered by the departments. However,<br />\nsome sort of University oversight committee should establish minimum standards and<br />\nmake sure these are met by all departments.<br />\nThis would ensure that all departments make<br />\n<br />\nan honest effort to tackle the problem, but<br />\nwould allow departments to adopt stricter<br />\nstandards it' necessary.<br />\nFor those graduate students who apply for<br />\nteaching jobs and fail the verbal test, a crash<br />\n' course in English should be mandatory. A<br />\nhigh intensity course, such as the one taught<br />\nby Linda Ziff would probably guarantee<br />\ncompetence in English after one semester.<br />\nThis system, while workable and probably<br />\neffective, still leaves one critical problem unsolved. Many foreign students apply for<br />\nteaching positions before they arrive at<br />\nHopkins. It would be too costly to administer verbal test in foreign countries, and<br />\nsince the acquisition of a teaching job often<br />\naffects a graduate's decision to attend<br />\nHopkins, it is impossible to weed out the incompetents before their first semester. First<br />\nyear teaching assistants,therefore, should be<br />\nplaced in large classes where there are other<br />\nteaching assistants that speak English well.<br />\nIt' an undergraduate has difficulty understanding his teaching assistant, he should be<br />\nallowed to switch into another section.<br />\nBecause they will be taking a crash course<br />\nin English, all graduate students should attain the competence necessary to teach any<br />\nclass by their second semester.<br />\nThe goal in tackling the problem of<br />\nteaching assistants who cannot speak English<br />\nis to improve undergraduate education while<br />\npreserving the quality of graduate students.<br />\nBy assigning first year teaching assistants<br />\ncourses that include native colleagues and requiring a crash English course for those who<br />\nsuffer an inadequate mastery of the<br />\nlanguage, this goal can be achieved.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nHopkins Women Do Not Have Fat Thighs<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhile reading the first issue<br />\nof the illustrious News-Letter,<br />\nI came across one rather disturbing sentence.

Responsibility. There are<br />\nseveral components to this<br />\nquestion, the first of which is<br />\nthe nature of the responsibility<br />\nof the Senior Class Council to<br />\nthe senior class as a whole. The<br />\nclass representatives were not<br />\nelected a guardians or the<br />\npurblic morals, not have thy the<br />\nright to assume such a responsibility. Rich ans Lois have accepted responsibility for the<br />\nrunning of the film series. Who<br />\nis our class council trying to<br />\nprotect by raising such a fuss?<br />\nAside from some nebulous<br />\nremarks noting concern by<br />\nChris Colombo, I have seen no<br />\nindication that the administration has tried to interfere with<br />\nthe showing of the film. I voted<br />\nfor the senior class representatives hoping that they would<br />\nrepresent the wishes of the<br />\nsenior class. I challenge them to<br />\nask their constituency whether<br />\nor not the film should be<br />\nshown. The fact is that Chris<br />\nHampton and Stephanie Kretchmer are using their office to<br />\nexpress their personal viewpoints, and to enforce them.<br />\nThis is presumptuous and wholly inappropriate.<br />\nSecondly, there is our<br />\nresponsibility as Hopkins<br />\nstudents. Kretchmer seems to<br />\nfeel that this means that we<br />\nshould be \"adults\" and make<br />\na grown-up decision not to<br />\nshow the movie. This is based<br />\non several misconceptions. One<br />\nof the attractions of' this university for me is that it refuses to<br />\ncondescend to the student. We<br />\nare treated as adults capable of<br />\nmaking adult decisions. This<br />\ndoes not mean that they have to<br />\nbe correct (if only life were that<br />\nsimple), but rather that we accept the consequences of our<br />\nactions and above all that we<br />\nthink before we act.

The opportunities offered<br />\nby the University environment<br />\nare potential ones, due to the<br />\nfact that we live in a partial<br />\nvacuum. At Hopkins, 75 percent of what the students learn<br />\nshould not come from the<br />\nclassroom. It comes from interaction with others, and from<br />\ntaking advantage of the greatest<br />\nresource of all, the diversity of<br />\nopinion and character that<br />\nmakes up the student body. It<br />\nsaddens me to think how many<br />\npeople treat this place as a<br />\nglorified pre-professional<br />\nschool, and never think of<br />\nrevising an opinion, challenging<br />\nan assumption\u2014in other<br />\nwords, getting an education<br />\nand learning to think.

The administration believes that in order to<br />\ndeter war we must face down<br />\nwith<br />\nour<br />\nSoviets<br />\nthe<br />\npreparedness to wage war, including nucleat war. Registration is an integral part of this<br />\npolicy. It decreases the time<br />\nneeded to mobilize the population<br />\nand supposedly<br />\ndemonstrates the support of<br />\nAmerica's youth For the policy.<br />\nSince a refusal by many men to<br />\nregister will encourage skepticism on the Soviet's part<br />\ntowards this policy, dissent has<br />\nto be minimized.<br />\nRegistration is, therefore, not<br />\nan innocuous request by our<br />\ngovernment, it is a very serious<br />\nact in which every man who<br />\nregisters is, whether he likes it<br />\nor not, participating in a policy<br />\nthat increases our war<br />\npreparedness. Many people<br />\nbelieve that our preparations<br />\nfor war are increasing, not<br />\ndecreasing, the possibility of a<br />\nconflict. History is replete with<br />\nexamples of when this has occurred. This brings us to the<br />\ncrucial point. 50,000 nuclear<br />\nbombs are out there. Most, as<br />\nit happens, are ours. It may be<br />\nimpossible for America to<br />\nfollow the same nationalistic<br />\n<br />\nand militaristic policy that it<br />\nhas been following without<br />\nrisking incredible and unprecedented consequences, our<br />\npossible extinction included.<br />\nSome men find it intolerable<br />\nthat they must participate in a<br />\nregistration program that they<br />\nbelieve is helping to increase the<br />\nrisk of nuclear war. By their<br />\nconscience they cannot do so.<br />\nFollowing one's conscience is<br />\nthe highest human act, the<br />\ngreatest duty and transcends<br />\nnational law. Despite the fact<br />\nthat most nonregistrants are<br />\nmotivated by a strong desire for<br />\npeace, the U.S. government is<br />\nwilling to hit these men with a<br />\nfive year jail term and a $10,000<br />\nfine. That is how serious the<br />\ngovernment is about increasing<br />\nour war preparedness. That<br />\nmen risk such punishment<br />\ndemonstrates how serious people are in opposing it.<br />\nGregory Paul<br />\nLucas Baez<br />\nMark Roudebush<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nFriday afternoon I was stretched out on my sunlit sofa<br />\nslowly sipping Natty Bo, my<br />\nfavorite \"premium\" beer (it's<br />\ncheap), while reading The<br />\nNews-Letter when something<br />\nrudely \"awoke me to reality\",<br />\n<br />\ngoading me from my mellow<br />\nHopkins pre-med apathy to inscribe this reply to a class A (A<br />\nfor Ass) piece of folderol in the'<br />\nSept. 17 News-Letter. This letter is written in reply to Mr.<br />\nBeatty's contribution, which<br />\njust could not go unchallenged.<br />\nFirst of all, Mr. Beatty could<br />\nuse a course in rudimentary<br />\nlogic (and practical composition, while he's at it). In his<br />\njumbled sentences, he asserts<br />\nthat forcing someone to register<br />\nis not a violation of individual<br />\nliberty, and, next, that liberty<br />\n\"cannot be granted\u2014it must be<br />\nearned...\" From this, as far as<br />\nI could tell, he concludes that<br />\nby not registering, those evil<br />\npeople are intruding on his<br />\nrights and liberty. Wha...a..?<br />\nHuh?!! I think I missed<br />\nsomething between the lines.<br />\nAs for his miserable,<br />\nmindless assertion that \"liberty cannot be granted\u2014it must<br />\nbe earned,..\", I'd like to direct<br />\nMr. Beatty to the Declaration<br />\nof Independence, more<br />\nspecifically starting with the<br />\nfamiliar lines \"We hold these<br />\ntruths to be self-evident, that all<br />\nmen are created equal, that they<br />\nare endowed by their Creator<br />\nwith inalienable Rights...\" We<br />\nare born free. The catch is that<br />\nthere may be others trying to<br />\ndeny our rights.<br />\nNext, Mr. Beatty challenges<br />\nthe anti-registration people to<br />\n<br />\nchange the laws if they don't<br />\nlike them, and thus displays<br />\nand incredible political naivete<br />\nrarely seen outside of the<br />\nScience Reserve Room! It's not<br />\nthat easy, buddy. For example,<br />\nlaws enforcing a right as basic<br />\nas racial equality have taken a<br />\ncentury and a half of courage,<br />\nresistance, pain, and, yes,<br />\n\"breaking the established<br />\nlaws\" to achieve.<br />\nIn fact, what Phil Schmandt<br />\nand the draft resisters are doing<br />\nis exactly one time-honored,<br />\n\"proven\" way of changing the<br />\nestablished law.<br />\nOne has to keep in mind that<br />\nthe Majority may not be<br />\nnecessarily right. Just because<br />\neveryone mindlessly \"goes<br />\nalong\" and, without question,<br />\naccepts a practice you feel is<br />\nwrong, you should not be forced to give up your convictions<br />\nand thus your own individuality. This rigid conformity and<br />\ndogmatic sloganeering (about<br />\n\"liberty\" and \"national security\" and \"duty\")that Mr. Beatty seems to indulge himself in<br />\nis precisely what Thoreau spent<br />\na lifetime trying to get away<br />\nfrom.<br />\nI believe registration is, on<br />\nthe whole, in the interest of the<br />\ncountry and should be enforced. And those that don't<br />\nregister should be merely, simply, charged with violating<br />\nfederal law and so prosecuted,<br />\n<br />\nnot branded \"traitors\" and<br />\n\"cowards\" or charged with getting \"free rides\", \"threatening<br />\nour liberty (most holy) and<br />\nsecurity (most<br />\nvital)\",<br />\n\"violating the tenents of<br />\nmanhood\", etc, ad nauseurn. If<br />\nanything, we should admire<br />\nthem (while not necessarily<br />\nagreeing with their views) for<br />\ntheir courage and outspokenness. They are an American<br />\ntradition.<br />\nIn closing, I quote Albert<br />\nEinstein, to the effect that:<br />\n\"Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition<br />\nfrom mediocre minds.\"<br />\nI rest,<br />\nGary D.

By<br />\nallowing the elections commission to interpret what the student body may vote on in the<br />\nform of a referendum, the<br />\nCouncil has made it impossible<br />\nfor any student to bring an<br />\nissue before the Council that<br />\nthe Council does not wish to<br />\ndeal with, or worse, does not<br />\nagree with. Due to the lack of<br />\na proper system of checks and<br />\nbalances, the Student Council<br />\nhas assumed all policy determining powers without having<br />\nto listen to the needs and wishes<br />\nof the student body. The<br />\nsubstantial number of people<br />\nwho signed Mr. Lally's petition<br />\nwere in effect asking the Council to allow a popular vote the<br />\nopportunity to correct what<br />\n<br />\nStudent government was<br />\noriginally designed to guarantee<br />\nthe student body a say in determining the policies that regulate<br />\nevery day life at the university<br />\nlevel.

It had as much feeling<br />\nbut not as much accent on some<br />\nwords that could have been<br />\nmore strongly said.<br />\nMike disagreed with Grant<br />\nand represented the Council's<br />\nside of the story. He said that<br />\nGrant had submitted a poster<br />\nthat publicized the JHU Parliament and not the Parliamentary<br />\nForum. He then added that<br />\nGrant and the Council had<br />\nagreed on the name Parliamentary Forum when the club was<br />\nfirst proposed. The name<br />\nParliament was refused because<br />\nit would be confused with the<br />\nStudent Council as the governing body on campus.<br />\nAll of this seemed pretty<br />\nreasonable. An amendment was<br />\nproposed which prohibited<br />\ncampus groups from changing<br />\ntheir assigned names which<br />\nmeant that the Class of 1985<br />\nwouldn't be able to be referred<br />\nto as the sophomore class in<br />\ntheir publicity posters, as someone quickly pointed out.<br />\nThat also seemed reasonable.<br />\nBut then something happened. Brian Mirsky, the president<br />\nof the College Republicans,<br />\nmotioned that an amendment<br />\nbe made to the amendment. He<br />\ncalled for the renaming of the<br />\nParliamentary Forum to the<br />\nJHU Parliament because, according to Brian, \"I'll be<br />\nJamned if someone told me<br />\nwhat to name my group.\"<br />\nIt gets better.<br />\nA vote was taken on the<br />\namendment to the amendment,<br />\nwhich by the way was never<br />\nvoted on, and the result was<br />\neighteen against, seventeen in<br />\nfavor, and several abstaining.<br />\nThey tried using the yeas and<br />\nneas first, but it didn't sound to<br />\nwell.<br />\nThe vote was too close so<br />\nBrian suggested a standing<br />\nvote.

This condition has<br />\nseveral different manifestations,<br />\nalthough most students complain of<br />\ndepression and unhappiness. One student, now a junior, had a particularly<br />\nserious case: he stopped going to classes<br />\nand doing homework because he jusr<br />\nfelt \"tired of it all.\"<br />\nThere are several causes of<br />\nsophomore slump; an important one,<br />\naccording to Dr. Ghislaine Godenne,<br />\nQirector of Counseling and Psychiatric<br />\nServices, is that the novelty of freshman<br />\nyear is gone. \"During the first year<br />\neverything is new and exciting, but as<br />\nsophomores, the students realize that<br />\ncollege hasn't answered their dreams.<br />\nThey're not having fun and they begin<br />\nto feel the pressure to achieve within the<br />\nHopkins community.\"<br />\nThe excitement of freshman year<br />\nstarts long before you ever get to<br />\nHopkins. When you receive a letter of<br />\nacceptance\u2014expected or not\u2014you tend<br />\nto congratulate yourself on your intelligence. These sentiments are reinforced by those who, once informed that<br />\nyou are going to Hopkins, assume you<br />\nplan to become a -doctor.<br />\nA freshman meets people of his own<br />\nintellectual caliber. He makes friends,<br />\nand begins to enjoy the challenges of<br />\ncollege life. When sophomore year rolls<br />\naround, however, he loses much of the<br />\nfeeling of being special. He no longer<br />\nconsiders himself particularly outstanding, feeling that everyone at Hopkins<br />\nis smart. Instead of seeing fellow<br />\nstudents as partners in intellectual conversations, he comes to view them as<br />\ncompetition. One student describes the<br />\ndifference between fr,.!shnin and<br />\nsophomores: \"Freshmen walk around<br />\ndiscussing Shakespeare's plays and Einstein's Theory of Relativity; sophomores<br />\ntalk about how much they paid for<br />\nbooks.\"<br />\nAnother factor of depression among<br />\nsophomores is the impending decision<br />\nabout the rest of their lives. Freshman<br />\nyear is spent recovering from the last big<br />\ndecision, that of choosing a college, but<br />\nin sophomore year the future looms<br />\nlarge. The question of whether to enter<br />\nthe job market or apply to graduate or<br />\nprofessional school is one that weighs<br />\nheavily on the minds of sophomores. A<br />\nstudy done by the Hopkins Psychiatric<br />\nServices upholds this notion. A six-year<br />\nsurvey, covering the years 1973-1979,<br />\nshowed the main reason for most<br />\nsecond-year students' visits to the White<br />\nHouse was to discuss career-related and<br />\nacademic problems.

Before he took<br />\nhis act to arenas, \"the Boss\" usually<br />\n<br />\nplayed small clubs, where he still felt<br />\nfree enough to experiment. Often he was<br />\nbacked by only a guitar or, as on<br />\n\"Thunder Road,\" a piano. To hear that<br />\nsong, shorn of its studio excess, is to be<br />\nreminded of its beautiful melody. Many<br />\nof Springsteen's best songs lend<br />\n<br />\nFoxfire At The Mechanic<br />\nBY LEANNA CHAMISH<br />\nDavid Trainer, the director of the new<br />\nSusan Cooper-Hume Cronyn play Foxfire, currently playing at the Mechanic<br />\nTheatre, seems to have taken an interest<br />\nin endangered species. Recently he staged the acclaimed off-Broadway success<br />\nThe Dining Room, which was about the<br />\ndeterioration of traditional WASP<br />\nculture. Now, in Foxfire, Trainer<br />\ndisplays the endangered mountain folk<br />\nof northeast Georgia, whose natural<br />\nhabits and habitat are being threatened<br />\nby new values and encroaching<br />\nsuburbia.<br />\nThe play is painted in strokes as broad<br />\nas an Appalachian panorama, but about<br />\nas deep as the snow in July. Everything<br />\nis spelled out for the audience, so the<br />\nplay is not challenging to watch and<br />\ndoes not require close attention; it is the<br />\nuniqueness of setting and character<br />\nfrom which the play derives its interest<br />\nand color. Against the constant sound<br />\nof chirping crickets and David Mitchell's<br />\nbreathtaking set, we observe the mountain folk, whose simple pragmatism is<br />\noften shocking and humorous to city<br />\nsensibilities.<br />\nThe plot is very simple: one old<br />\nwoman holding tenaciously to her land<br />\nand her old way of life, pitted against<br />\na greedy, polyester-clad land buyerand<br />\na son who wants her to leave the mountain because he worries about her being<br />\nall alone. But we find out that the old<br />\nwoman, Annie Nations (beautifully portrayed by Jessica Tandy), is not quite<br />\nalone: she is kept company by the ghost<br />\nof her dead husband Hector, played by<br />\nCronyn. This situation provides the play<br />\nwith a great deal of its humor, since only<br />\nAnnie can see Hector.<br />\nThe theme of the play is blatant:<br />\n<br />\nthemselkes to interpretation, and like<br />\nmany of Bob Dylan's, they often sound<br />\njust as good when sung by someone else.<br />\nHowever, it is hard to imagine anyone<br />\nbut Springsteen singing the songs on<br />\nNebraska, his new acoustic album.<br />\nLaid down on Springsteen's own<br />\nfour-track recorder, the ten cuts feature<br />\nan occasional tambourine and synthesizer to go along with guitar and harmonica.

The characters talk about how<br />\nthe landscape is changing as a result of<br />\nsuburban sprawl, and they talk about<br />\nhow things were in the old days. For example, Annie says that back then,<br />\n\"when folks gets married they stay married.\" Hector and Annie were married<br />\nfor 62 years, but Dillard Nations, their<br />\ncountry-singer son (Keith Carradine) is<br />\nin the process of divorcing his wife, who<br />\njust left him for another man. The<br />\nflashbacks used to contrast past and present are somewhat jarring, because the<br />\ncharacters stay in the same costumes and<br />\nmake-up for the flashbacks. In one<br />\nscene, Annie, hunched and decrepit,<br />\ntells her son how she met his father. The<br />\nlighting changes to indicate the change<br />\nin time, and suddenly Annie Nations is<br />\na young girl at a hoedown, twirling<br />\nacross the stage in her orthopedic shoes.<br />\nOverall, this is a delightful play.

Professional sports are not just fun<br />\nand games, but are big business<br />\ninvolving lots of money, where<br />\nthe action between lawyers,<br />\nlabor negotiators and agents is<br />\nas important as the action between the players.

The<br />\nowners had talked of fielding<br />\nteams of strike-breaking players<br />\nand free agents, but they have<br />\nmade no moves in that direcion<br />\nand now seem inclined to simply close down for the duration<br />\nof the strike. The main stumbling block no longer appears to<br />\nbe one of money (the owners<br />\nhave reportedly offered 1.6<br />\n<br />\nbillion dollars over five years,<br />\nand the players reportedly want<br />\nthe same amount over four<br />\nyears), but of control. The<br />\nunion wants player salaries tied<br />\nto revenue, at last report fifty<br />\npercent of T.V. revenues, and<br />\nit wants to end individual<br />\nbargaining, having the money<br />\ngiven to the union instead,<br />\nwhich would distribute it to the<br />\nplayers on the basis of seniority and performance.

In<br />\nmany ways, this is one of the<br />\ngoals of Coach Henry Ciccarone and his staff for fall:<br />\nTrying to make the: newcomers<br />\nfeel at home, fall lacrosse<br />\nwelcomes them in a very lowkey manner. But that is not all.<br />\nCoach Ciccarone also uses it to<br />\nindoctrinate the freshmen and<br />\ntransfers into the system; to see<br />\nwhat they can do and who can<br />\nhelp the team in the spring. It<br />\nis a time when the coaching<br />\nstaff can work more with the<br />\nyounger players, as seniors and<br />\nmost juniors do not play. The<br />\ncoaches are out to evaluate the<br />\nnewcomers, and to see how far<br />\nthe sophsimores have progressed since last year. They stress<br />\nand work on fundamentals,<br />\nsuch as stickhandling, throwing<br />\nand catching. The players are<br />\nout to improve themselves and<br />\nshow what they can do. Losing<br />\nand winning are not that important; as Coach Ciccarone says:<br />\n\"It is a time for players to get<br />\n<br />\nto know the system and improve on basics. But you can't<br />\nget too intense; all the pressure<br />\nis on during spring.\"<br />\nNevertheless, this is not to<br />\nsay that the players are not concerned wilh winning, as<br />\nevidenced during the scrimmage against the Maryland<br />\nLacrosse Club. Facing last<br />\nyear's club champions, including several All-World<br />\nplayers for USA last June, and<br />\nHopkins alumni College Player<br />\nof the Year four years ago,<br />\nMike Greenberg, the Blue Jays<br />\nturned in a very spirited<br />\nperformance.<br />\nThroughout much, if not<br />\nmost of the game, they played<br />\nMLC evenly, and in fact<br />\ndominated a great deal of the<br />\nplay during the second half, only to lose by a score of 11-10.<br />\nHowever, it was a performance<br />\nCoach Ciccarone should be<br />\nproud of, as the Jays played<br />\nwith only two starters from last<br />\nyear's team, All-Americans<br />\nJohn Krumenacker and Peter<br />\nScott. Six starters from last<br />\nyear's squad are seniors, and do<br />\nnot participate in fall lacrosse.<br />\nThe other two, All-Americans<br />\nJeff Cook and Dave Black have<br />\ngraduated.

Singles players<br />\nGeraldine Klauber, Keni<br />\nFischer, Amy Buchanan, Julie<br />\nNorth, Lizzy Hirschorn and<br />\nBelinda Griffith all won convincingly, losing a combined<br />\ntotal of 15 games the entire<br />\nmatch. The score was a repeat<br />\nof last year's meeting with<br />\nWidener, who ended the season<br />\n<br />\nin last place in the MAC's<br />\nSouthern Division.<br />\nOn Saturday the team traveled to Salisbury College and<br />\nracked up a 6-3 score. Victories<br />\ncame at the first four singles<br />\npositions, as well as first and second doubles.<br />\nThe Lady Jays' first home<br />\nmatch on Wednesday ended<br />\nwith a 6-3 victory over Loyola.<br />\nOnce again, the team<br />\n, demonstrated its strength at the<br />\nsingles positions, taking the top<br />\nfour in straight sets.<br />\n1 As coach Kay Fowler noted,<br />\nhowever, upcoming matches<br />\nshould be a greater .test of her<br />\nteam's strength<br />\n<br />\nHopkins was playing against a<br />\nsquad which has been playing<br />\ntogether for years. The Blue<br />\nJays had only four full days of<br />\npractice prior to the scrimmage.<br />\nDuring the game, the coaches<br />\n<br />\ning back, further boosted by<br />\nfreshman Ditommaso from<br />\nLong Island.

On attack, well, who can<br />\nchange much of the offensive<br />\nphilosophy, as the attack has<br />\n<br />\nreplace Jeff Cook? Certainly<br />\nPeter Scott, who looked very<br />\ngood in this scrimmage, will be<br />\nexpected to dominate more, but<br />\nCoach Ciccarone will probably<br />\nlost much of last year's depth<br />\nto the graduation of Mike Donnelly, Craig Cook and Kyle<br />\nHicks.<br />\nIt' this scrimmage is to be of<br />\nany indication, there should be<br />\nhigh hopes for Blue Jay<br />\nlacrosse this spring, since the<br />\nplayers not only demonstrated<br />\nan abundance of talent, but<br />\nalso a desire and an attitude for<br />\nwinning against a very powerful squad. Wilbur Cantelli, a<br />\nstarting midfielder on last<br />\nyear's team, described the Blue<br />\nJay's performance very well.<br />\n\"We looked good, but MLC is<br />\nawful tough and has been<br />\nplayng together for a long time.<br />\nBut we have a lot of talent.<br />\nEveryone looks good.\"<br />\n<br />\nWidener Streak Continues<br />\nBY GARY BENNINCHOFF<br />\nThe Blue .lay football team<br />\nentertained the class of their<br />\nleague last Friday night when<br />\nthey squared off against the<br />\nWidener Pioneers.

Mike<br />\nBurke, receiving the opening<br />\nnod at the quarterback position, cooly marched his squad<br />\ninto Widener territory with his<br />\nfirst series of plays.

According to Ashley, Hopkins men<br />\nbelieved that if they fought<br />\nhard and well \"they could<br />\nall<br />\nreserve democrac<br /><br />\nOCIOBER 1. 1982<br /><br />\nTA Test<br />\nCauses<br />\nConflict<br /><br />\nBY ETHAN RARICK<br /><br />\nAlthough student activism<br />\nat Johns Hopkins is experiencing a lull, students have<br />\nbecome increasingly less<br />\napathetic in the past few<br />\nyears. In comparison to the<br />\nactive eras before World<br />\nWars I and II, and the 1960s,<br />\nHopkins political life is considered by many to be dull.<br />\nHowever, with increasing activity by various campus<br />\norganizations, and evergrowing awareness by all<br />\nstudents, political activism at<br />\nHopkins is becoming more<br />\nprevalent.<br />\nBefore each of the world<br />\nwars there was strong<br />\npatriotic sentiment on campus, nevertheless, students<br />\nwere content with going to<br />\nschool and pursuing the<br />\nAmerican policy of isolationism. Before the U.S.<br />\nentered World War I, only a<br />\nfew men left Hopkins early to<br />\nfight, but the students did request that a course in military<br />\ntraining be offered. The<br />\ncourse was established in<br />\n1916, and it was made clear<br />\nthat Hopkins did not \"believe<br />\nthis country was on the eve of<br />\nwar but that Ho kin'<br /><br />\nIN THE FOLD<br />\nThe Inei\u2022itable<br />\nPart<br />\nLife<br />\nHophins:<br />\nSophomore Slump<br /><br />\naround the world.\"<br />\nPre-World War II Hopkins<br />\nstudents were not as inclined<br />\nto promote the war effort.<br />\nThe nation was just recovering from the Depression, and<br />\nthe sentiment was towards remaining neutral. During 1937<br />\nand 1938 the Peace Council<br />\nwas established on campus. It<br />\norganized a peace strike during which students left their<br />\nclasses and quietly protested<br />\nthe war. There were no vehement and energetic rallies. In<br />\n1940 the American Student's<br />\ncont. on p. 14<br /><br />\nobjects to next Sunday's program,.both because it is again<br />\nscheduled on the Jewish holiday of Sukkat and because he<br />\nviews the program as. biased.<br />\nProfessor Samih Farsoun, head<br />\nof the Sociology Department at<br />\nAmerican University, is<br />\nscheduled to speak on the<br />\n\"Roots and Consequences of<br />\nthe Israeli invasion of<br />\nLebanon.\" Farsoun is a<br />\nPalestinian (born in Lebanon),<br />\nand Kaye said the JSA objects<br />\nbecause there will be no proIsraeli speaker.<br />\n\"We want a balanced view,\"<br />\nsaid Wickwire, \"but not<br />\nnecessarily two people at the<br />\nsame time. [Wanting a balanced view] doesn't mean we<br />\nwould do well to have two people going at each other.\"<br />\nWickwire also noted that a<br />\npro-lsraei speaker is scheduled<br />\nto speak in two weeks.<br />\nThe JSA also objects because<br />\nthe program deals with the<br />\nMiddle East, but is scheduled<br />\non Sukkot, which Kaye describas<br />\ned<br />\n\"the<br />\nJewish<br />\nThanksgiving.\"<br />\nWhen the JSA met with<br />\nWickwire early this week, they<br />\nasked him to reschedule Farsoun's speech, Kaye said. But<br />\nby then, according to<br />\nWickwire, announcements of<br />\nthe program had already been<br />\nsent out, making a change virtually impossible.<br />\n\"We don't pay a whole lot of<br />\nattention to Christian holidays,<br />\neither,\" Wickwire added. He<br />\nstressed that in scheduling<br />\nevents \"there was no intention<br />\nto do anything behind<br />\nanybody's back.\"<br />\nAsked if he thought there<br />\nwas anything unfair in the fact<br />\nthat the program was scheduled on Sukkot, Wickwire said,<br />\n\"No.\"<br />\nThe JSA and the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice have had disagreements<br />\nin the past.<br />\n\"[The JSA and the<br />\nChaplain] haven't had a good<br />\nrelationship for the past few<br />\nyears,\" said Kaye. Kaye<br />\nbelieves that Wickwire, as<br />\nChaplain, should be more sensitive to the needs of Jewish<br />\nstudents.<br /><br />\nThe Education Committee<br />\nhas passed a resolution calling<br />\nfor verbal English skills to be an<br />\nintegral part of' the criteria used to select foreign teaching<br />\nassistants (T.A.$). The resolution has been endorsed by the<br />\nStudent Council and it will next<br />\nbe considered by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies<br />\n(CUS).<br />\nTim Gilbreath, chairman of<br />\nthe Education Committee, cites<br />\ntwo major reasons for such<br />\ncriteria. \"We are paying for<br />\n[the T.A.s] to provide a service,<br />\nwhich they cannot provide if<br />\nthey can't speak English, and if<br />\n[a T.A.] cannot speak, he is ineffective at teaching.\" The<br />\nEducation Committee decided<br />\nthat the solution to the problem<br />\nwould be to have the University administer verbal proficiency exams.

It should be<br />\nadministered by the departments. However,<br />\nsome sort of University oversight committee should establish minimum standards and<br />\nmake sure these are met by all departments.<br />\nThis would ensure that all departments make<br /><br />\nan honest effort to tackle the problem, but<br />\nwould allow departments to adopt stricter<br />\nstandards it' necessary.<br />\nFor those graduate students who apply for<br />\nteaching jobs and fail the verbal test, a crash<br />\n' course in English should be mandatory. A<br />\nhigh intensity course, such as the one taught<br />\nby Linda Ziff would probably guarantee<br />\ncompetence in English after one semester.<br />\nThis system, while workable and probably<br />\neffective, still leaves one critical problem unsolved. Many foreign students apply for<br />\nteaching positions before they arrive at<br />\nHopkins. It would be too costly to administer verbal test in foreign countries, and<br />\nsince the acquisition of a teaching job often<br />\naffects a graduate's decision to attend<br />\nHopkins, it is impossible to weed out the incompetents before their first semester. First<br />\nyear teaching assistants,therefore, should be<br />\nplaced in large classes where there are other<br />\nteaching assistants that speak English well.<br />\nIt' an undergraduate has difficulty understanding his teaching assistant, he should be<br />\nallowed to switch into another section.<br />\nBecause they will be taking a crash course<br />\nin English, all graduate students should attain the competence necessary to teach any<br />\nclass by their second semester.<br />\nThe goal in tackling the problem of<br />\nteaching assistants who cannot speak English<br />\nis to improve undergraduate education while<br />\npreserving the quality of graduate students.<br />\nBy assigning first year teaching assistants<br />\ncourses that include native colleagues and requiring a crash English course for those who<br />\nsuffer an inadequate mastery of the<br />\nlanguage, this goal can be achieved.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nHopkins Women Do Not Have Fat Thighs<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhile reading the first issue<br />\nof the illustrious News-Letter,<br />\nI came across one rather disturbing sentence. In the \"travesty\" entitled, \"What Tomorrow's Leaders are Really<br />\nReading Now\", I found the explanation for item number 8 -Thin Thighs in Thirty Days, to<br />\nbe particularly offensive. It<br />\nseems that the author is implying that the entire population of<br />\nHopkins does not include fine,<br /><br />\nvital specimens of manhood<br />\nand womanhood. I beg to differ with this obviously<br />\nstereotypical view. Many<br />\nundergraduates at Hopkins are<br />\nattractive and such a statement<br />\nperpetuates the reputation of<br />\nthe Hopkins student as socially unappealing.

Responsibility. There are<br />\nseveral components to this<br />\nquestion, the first of which is<br />\nthe nature of the responsibility<br />\nof the Senior Class Council to<br />\nthe senior class as a whole. The<br />\nclass representatives were not<br />\nelected a guardians or the<br />\npurblic morals, not have thy the<br />\nright to assume such a responsibility. Rich ans Lois have accepted responsibility for the<br />\nrunning of the film series. Who<br />\nis our class council trying to<br />\nprotect by raising such a fuss?<br />\nAside from some nebulous<br />\nremarks noting concern by<br />\nChris Colombo, I have seen no<br />\nindication that the administration has tried to interfere with<br />\nthe showing of the film. I voted<br />\nfor the senior class representatives hoping that they would<br />\nrepresent the wishes of the<br />\nsenior class. I challenge them to<br />\nask their constituency whether<br />\nor not the film should be<br />\nshown. The fact is that Chris<br />\nHampton and Stephanie Kretchmer are using their office to<br />\nexpress their personal viewpoints, and to enforce them.<br />\nThis is presumptuous and wholly inappropriate.<br />\nSecondly, there is our<br />\nresponsibility as Hopkins<br />\nstudents. Kretchmer seems to<br />\nfeel that this means that we<br />\nshould be \"adults\" and make<br />\na grown-up decision not to<br />\nshow the movie. This is based<br />\non several misconceptions. One<br />\nof the attractions of' this university for me is that it refuses to<br />\ncondescend to the student. We<br />\nare treated as adults capable of<br />\nmaking adult decisions. This<br />\ndoes not mean that they have to<br />\nbe correct (if only life were that<br />\nsimple), but rather that we accept the consequences of our<br />\nactions and above all that we<br />\nthink before we act. The decision to show \"Deep Throat\"<br />\nwas such a decision\u2014it was not<br />\ntaken lightly or irresponsibly.<br /><br />\nWhy is it that when someone Throat\" is a cheap and sleazy<br />\nattempts to exercies our rights sexploitation film, and that acas adults our own classmates counts for most of its appeal.<br />\ntry to sell us out? It has always If someone things such films<br />\nbeen my experience (albeit are immoral, fine. I don't.

Stay home if you want,<br />\nthey act in a manner that war- and read Aquinas, but avoid<br />\nrants it. Why is it that our the Bible\u2014it's much sleazier<br />\nelected representatives seem than \"Deep Throat\", and just<br />\nleast capable of this? It' they about as explicit.<br />\n4. The Nature of Porcannot or will not handle the<br />\nresponsibility that showing nography. One of the ways that<br />\n\"Deep Throat\" entails, then narrow-minded, insecure, selfthey should leave it to those righteous people attempt to<br />\nwho can. But having done that, force their restrictive morals on<br />\nas in this case, they should have others is by claiming vast public<br />\nthe grace and civility not to pull significance for their personal<br />\nan about-face and attempt to views. They say that porscore personal ethics points nography breeds corruption<br />\nthrough supercilious moral and sin. This is the opposite of<br />\nthe truth. In the hypocritical<br />\nposturing. .<br />\n2. Vice. Vice is big money. society that we call home, sex<br />\nMost people are rather is generally considered bad, sinhypocritical about it.

I'm sick of lines like<br />\n\"The showing of this film<br />\nreflects poorly on the senior<br />\nclass and the University.\" This<br />\nis nonsense. It reflects nothing<br />\nat all, other than the desire to<br />\nmake money. People who insist<br />\non generalizing from such an<br />\nincident do so out of their own<br />\npersonal need for selfaggrandizement. Their attitude<br />\nis petty and contemptible, since<br />\nthey insist on elevating<br />\nthemselves to a position of<br />\nmoral superiority at the expense<br />\nof the Hopkins Community. It<br />\nis particularly shocking to hear<br />\nsuch things coming from our<br />\nclass representatives. They<br />\nshould know better.<br />\n6.0flensiveness. This is<br />\nanother personal issue, rather<br />\nsimilar to the issue of morality.<br />\nThose offended by the film<br />\nshould not attend.

Fellatio is illegal in<br />\nMaryland, as is anything other<br />\nthan the missionary position. I<br />\nrest my case.<br />\nIn conclusion, it seems to me<br />\nthat, while the actual showing<br />\nof \"Deep Throat\" is of little intrinsic significance, it raises important issues. Perhaps the<br />\nmost important of these is the<br /><br />\nHarry, You Did One Helluva Job<br />\nBY STEVE EISENBERG<br />\nStudents don't really know<br />\nwhat the Garrett Room of the<br />\nMilton S.

The opportunities offered<br />\nby the University environment<br />\nare potential ones, due to the<br />\nfact that we live in a partial<br />\nvacuum. At Hopkins, 75 percent of what the students learn<br />\nshould not come from the<br />\nclassroom. It comes from interaction with others, and from<br />\ntaking advantage of the greatest<br />\nresource of all, the diversity of<br />\nopinion and character that<br />\nmakes up the student body. It<br />\nsaddens me to think how many<br />\npeople treat this place as a<br />\nglorified pre-professional<br />\nschool, and never think of<br />\nrevising an opinion, challenging<br />\nan assumption\u2014in other<br />\nwords, getting an education<br />\nand learning to think.

The administration believes that in order to<br />\ndeter war we must face down<br />\nwith<br />\nour<br />\nSoviets<br />\nthe<br />\npreparedness to wage war, including nucleat war. Registration is an integral part of this<br />\npolicy. It decreases the time<br />\nneeded to mobilize the population<br />\nand supposedly<br />\ndemonstrates the support of<br />\nAmerica's youth For the policy.<br />\nSince a refusal by many men to<br />\nregister will encourage skepticism on the Soviet's part<br />\ntowards this policy, dissent has<br />\nto be minimized.<br />\nRegistration is, therefore, not<br />\nan innocuous request by our<br />\ngovernment, it is a very serious<br />\nact in which every man who<br />\nregisters is, whether he likes it<br />\nor not, participating in a policy<br />\nthat increases our war<br />\npreparedness. Many people<br />\nbelieve that our preparations<br />\nfor war are increasing, not<br />\ndecreasing, the possibility of a<br />\nconflict. History is replete with<br />\nexamples of when this has occurred. This brings us to the<br />\ncrucial point. 50,000 nuclear<br />\nbombs are out there. Most, as<br />\nit happens, are ours. It may be<br />\nimpossible for America to<br />\nfollow the same nationalistic<br /><br />\nand militaristic policy that it<br />\nhas been following without<br />\nrisking incredible and unprecedented consequences, our<br />\npossible extinction included.<br />\nSome men find it intolerable<br />\nthat they must participate in a<br />\nregistration program that they<br />\nbelieve is helping to increase the<br />\nrisk of nuclear war. By their<br />\nconscience they cannot do so.<br />\nFollowing one's conscience is<br />\nthe highest human act, the<br />\ngreatest duty and transcends<br />\nnational law. Despite the fact<br />\nthat most nonregistrants are<br />\nmotivated by a strong desire for<br />\npeace, the U.S. government is<br />\nwilling to hit these men with a<br />\nfive year jail term and a $10,000<br />\nfine. That is how serious the<br />\ngovernment is about increasing<br />\nour war preparedness. That<br />\nmen risk such punishment<br />\ndemonstrates how serious people are in opposing it.<br />\nGregory Paul<br />\nLucas Baez<br />\nMark Roudebush<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nFriday afternoon I was stretched out on my sunlit sofa<br />\nslowly sipping Natty Bo, my<br />\nfavorite \"premium\" beer (it's<br />\ncheap), while reading The<br />\nNews-Letter when something<br />\nrudely \"awoke me to reality\",<br /><br />\ngoading me from my mellow<br />\nHopkins pre-med apathy to inscribe this reply to a class A (A<br />\nfor Ass) piece of folderol in the'<br />\nSept. 17 News-Letter. This letter is written in reply to Mr.<br />\nBeatty's contribution, which<br />\njust could not go unchallenged.<br />\nFirst of all, Mr. Beatty could<br />\nuse a course in rudimentary<br />\nlogic (and practical composition, while he's at it). In his<br />\njumbled sentences, he asserts<br />\nthat forcing someone to register<br />\nis not a violation of individual<br />\nliberty, and, next, that liberty<br />\n\"cannot be granted\u2014it must be<br />\nearned...\" From this, as far as<br />\nI could tell, he concludes that<br />\nby not registering, those evil<br />\npeople are intruding on his<br />\nrights and liberty. Wha...a..?<br />\nHuh?!! I think I missed<br />\nsomething between the lines.<br />\nAs for his miserable,<br />\nmindless assertion that \"liberty cannot be granted\u2014it must<br />\nbe earned,..\", I'd like to direct<br />\nMr. Beatty to the Declaration<br />\nof Independence, more<br />\nspecifically starting with the<br />\nfamiliar lines \"We hold these<br />\ntruths to be self-evident, that all<br />\nmen are created equal, that they<br />\nare endowed by their Creator<br />\nwith inalienable Rights...\" We<br />\nare born free. The catch is that<br />\nthere may be others trying to<br />\ndeny our rights.<br />\nNext, Mr. Beatty challenges<br />\nthe anti-registration people to<br /><br />\nchange the laws if they don't<br />\nlike them, and thus displays<br />\nand incredible political naivete<br />\nrarely seen outside of the<br />\nScience Reserve Room! It's not<br />\nthat easy, buddy. For example,<br />\nlaws enforcing a right as basic<br />\nas racial equality have taken a<br />\ncentury and a half of courage,<br />\nresistance, pain, and, yes,<br />\n\"breaking the established<br />\nlaws\" to achieve.<br />\nIn fact, what Phil Schmandt<br />\nand the draft resisters are doing<br />\nis exactly one time-honored,<br />\n\"proven\" way of changing the<br />\nestablished law.<br />\nOne has to keep in mind that<br />\nthe Majority may not be<br />\nnecessarily right. Just because<br />\neveryone mindlessly \"goes<br />\nalong\" and, without question,<br />\naccepts a practice you feel is<br />\nwrong, you should not be forced to give up your convictions<br />\nand thus your own individuality. This rigid conformity and<br />\ndogmatic sloganeering (about<br />\n\"liberty\" and \"national security\" and \"duty\")that Mr. Beatty seems to indulge himself in<br />\nis precisely what Thoreau spent<br />\na lifetime trying to get away<br />\nfrom.<br />\nI believe registration is, on<br />\nthe whole, in the interest of the<br />\ncountry and should be enforced. And those that don't<br />\nregister should be merely, simply, charged with violating<br />\nfederal law and so prosecuted,<br /><br />\nnot branded \"traitors\" and<br />\n\"cowards\" or charged with getting \"free rides\", \"threatening<br />\nour liberty (most holy) and<br />\nsecurity (most<br />\nvital)\",<br />\n\"violating the tenents of<br />\nmanhood\", etc, ad nauseurn.

By<br />\nallowing the elections commission to interpret what the student body may vote on in the<br />\nform of a referendum, the<br />\nCouncil has made it impossible<br />\nfor any student to bring an<br />\nissue before the Council that<br />\nthe Council does not wish to<br />\ndeal with, or worse, does not<br />\nagree with. Due to the lack of<br />\na proper system of checks and<br />\nbalances, the Student Council<br />\nhas assumed all policy determining powers without having<br />\nto listen to the needs and wishes<br />\nof the student body. The<br />\nsubstantial number of people<br />\nwho signed Mr. Lally's petition<br />\nwere in effect asking the Council to allow a popular vote the<br />\nopportunity to correct what<br /><br />\nStudent government was<br />\noriginally designed to guarantee<br />\nthe student body a say in determining the policies that regulate<br />\nevery day life at the university<br />\nlevel. As I understand it, student government's primary<br />\nfunction has always been and<br />\nmost definitely should continue<br />\nto be the protection of students'<br />\nrights from administrative<br />\nedicts. But who is to protect the<br />\nfrom<br />\nstudent<br />\nbody<br />\nauthoritarian decrees put forth<br />\nby the student government?<br />\nThe very foundation of any<br />\ndemocratic type of government<br />\nis the principle of checks and<br />\nbalances.

He already appointed the committee so<br />\neveryone yelled,\"Yea,\" and<br />\nthat was that.<br />\nJim Salles was then recognized by the chair. He said<br />\nsomething about making some<br />\namendments to the constitution. He had them all printed<br />\nup nice and neat and even<br />\ndistributed them to most of the<br />\nSAC members before the<br />\nmeeting began. Pretty responsible stuff for treasurer of the<br />\nBridge Club. Only kidding.<br />\nBut the thing was, Harry had<br />\nappointed a committee to handle such amendments so after<br />\nhe summarized them, everyone<br />\nyelled, \"Yea,\" and the amendments were accepted as a<br />\npackage to be further examined by the committee.<br />\nTime for new business.<br />\n\"The chair recognizes<br />\nGrant.\"<br />\nGrant was still sitting in the<br />\nsame place although he did<br />\nmove around the room<br />\nthroughout the meeting.

It had as much feeling<br />\nbut not as much accent on some<br />\nwords that could have been<br />\nmore strongly said.<br />\nMike disagreed with Grant<br />\nand represented the Council's<br />\nside of the story. He said that<br />\nGrant had submitted a poster<br />\nthat publicized the JHU Parliament and not the Parliamentary<br />\nForum. He then added that<br />\nGrant and the Council had<br />\nagreed on the name Parliamentary Forum when the club was<br />\nfirst proposed. The name<br />\nParliament was refused because<br />\nit would be confused with the<br />\nStudent Council as the governing body on campus.<br />\nAll of this seemed pretty<br />\nreasonable. An amendment was<br />\nproposed which prohibited<br />\ncampus groups from changing<br />\ntheir assigned names which<br />\nmeant that the Class of 1985<br />\nwouldn't be able to be referred<br />\nto as the sophomore class in<br />\ntheir publicity posters, as someone quickly pointed out.<br />\nThat also seemed reasonable.<br />\nBut then something happened. Brian Mirsky, the president<br />\nof the College Republicans,<br />\nmotioned that an amendment<br />\nbe made to the amendment. He<br />\ncalled for the renaming of the<br />\nParliamentary Forum to the<br />\nJHU Parliament because, according to Brian, \"I'll be<br />\nJamned if someone told me<br />\nwhat to name my group.\"<br />\nIt gets better.<br />\nA vote was taken on the<br />\namendment to the amendment,<br />\nwhich by the way was never<br />\nvoted on, and the result was<br />\neighteen against, seventeen in<br />\nfavor, and several abstaining.<br />\nThey tried using the yeas and<br />\nneas first, but it didn't sound to<br />\nwell.<br />\nThe vote was too close so<br />\nBrian suggested a standing<br />\nvote.

I am a 1981<br />\ngraduate of Mount Saint<br />\nMary's College in Emmitsburg<br />\nand, by talking to students, I<br />\nFound that students living on<br />\ncampus or on their own have<br />\nmuch better grades and a much<br />\nbetter social life than students<br />\nliving with their parents. 1 have<br />\nwritten to Governor Hughes to<br />\nsuggest ways to maximize student performance and 1 have<br />\nthese suggestions to improve<br />\nstudent performance both<br />\nacademically and socially:<br />\nFirst, I think all freshmen<br />\nshould be required to live on<br />\ncampus in a dormitory during<br />\ntheir freshman year and<br />\nfreshmen should NOT be<br />\nallowed to register a motor<br />\nvehicle on campus. The experience of living away from<br />\nhome maximize responsibility<br />\nand this results in better grades<br />\nand a better social life.<br />\nSecond, I think all upperclassmen should either live<br />\non campus or life in their own<br />\nresidence but NOT with their<br />\nparents. Again, students living<br />\nwith their parents have greater<br />\nsocial difficulties and lower<br />\ngrades than students living on<br />\ncampus or on their own.<br />\n1 think the cuts in student aid<br />\nare ridiculous because many<br /><br />\nstuderns now have to live at mission can be construed as ophome to save money.

This condition has<br />\nseveral different manifestations,<br />\nalthough most students complain of<br />\ndepression and unhappiness. One student, now a junior, had a particularly<br />\nserious case: he stopped going to classes<br />\nand doing homework because he jusr<br />\nfelt \"tired of it all.\"<br />\nThere are several causes of<br />\nsophomore slump; an important one,<br />\naccording to Dr. Ghislaine Godenne,<br />\nQirector of Counseling and Psychiatric<br />\nServices, is that the novelty of freshman<br />\nyear is gone. \"During the first year<br />\neverything is new and exciting, but as<br />\nsophomores, the students realize that<br />\ncollege hasn't answered their dreams.<br />\nThey're not having fun and they begin<br />\nto feel the pressure to achieve within the<br />\nHopkins community.\"<br />\nThe excitement of freshman year<br />\nstarts long before you ever get to<br />\nHopkins. When you receive a letter of<br />\nacceptance\u2014expected or not\u2014you tend<br />\nto congratulate yourself on your intelligence. These sentiments are reinforced by those who, once informed that<br />\nyou are going to Hopkins, assume you<br />\nplan to become a -doctor.<br />\nA freshman meets people of his own<br />\nintellectual caliber. He makes friends,<br />\nand begins to enjoy the challenges of<br />\ncollege life. When sophomore year rolls<br />\naround, however, he loses much of the<br />\nfeeling of being special. He no longer<br />\nconsiders himself particularly outstanding, feeling that everyone at Hopkins<br />\nis smart. Instead of seeing fellow<br />\nstudents as partners in intellectual conversations, he comes to view them as<br />\ncompetition. One student describes the<br />\ndifference between fr,.!shnin and<br />\nsophomores: \"Freshmen walk around<br />\ndiscussing Shakespeare's plays and Einstein's Theory of Relativity; sophomores<br />\ntalk about how much they paid for<br />\nbooks.\"<br />\nAnother factor of depression among<br />\nsophomores is the impending decision<br />\nabout the rest of their lives. Freshman<br />\nyear is spent recovering from the last big<br />\ndecision, that of choosing a college, but<br />\nin sophomore year the future looms<br />\nlarge. The question of whether to enter<br />\nthe job market or apply to graduate or<br />\nprofessional school is one that weighs<br />\nheavily on the minds of sophomores. A<br />\nstudy done by the Hopkins Psychiatric<br />\nServices upholds this notion. A six-year<br />\nsurvey, covering the years 1973-1979,<br />\nshowed the main reason for most<br />\nsecond-year students' visits to the White<br />\nHouse was to discuss career-related and<br />\nacademic problems. This is in contrast<br />\nto freshmen, who complained mostly<br />\nof physical problems, and seniors,<br />\nwhose difficulties were often peerrelated.<br />\nBecause career decisions are such an<br />\nintegral part of sophomore slump, it<br />\nseems natural that the best way to avoid<br />\nthe slump would be to have specific<br /><br />\net<br /><br />\ngoals for the future.

Before he took<br />\nhis act to arenas, \"the Boss\" usually<br /><br />\nplayed small clubs, where he still felt<br />\nfree enough to experiment. Often he was<br />\nbacked by only a guitar or, as on<br />\n\"Thunder Road,\" a piano. To hear that<br />\nsong, shorn of its studio excess, is to be<br />\nreminded of its beautiful melody. Many<br />\nof Springsteen's best songs lend<br /><br />\nFoxfire At The Mechanic<br />\nBY LEANNA CHAMISH<br />\nDavid Trainer, the director of the new<br />\nSusan Cooper-Hume Cronyn play Foxfire, currently playing at the Mechanic<br />\nTheatre, seems to have taken an interest<br />\nin endangered species. Recently he staged the acclaimed off-Broadway success<br />\nThe Dining Room, which was about the<br />\ndeterioration of traditional WASP<br />\nculture. Now, in Foxfire, Trainer<br />\ndisplays the endangered mountain folk<br />\nof northeast Georgia, whose natural<br />\nhabits and habitat are being threatened<br />\nby new values and encroaching<br />\nsuburbia.<br />\nThe play is painted in strokes as broad<br />\nas an Appalachian panorama, but about<br />\nas deep as the snow in July. Everything<br />\nis spelled out for the audience, so the<br />\nplay is not challenging to watch and<br />\ndoes not require close attention; it is the<br />\nuniqueness of setting and character<br />\nfrom which the play derives its interest<br />\nand color. Against the constant sound<br />\nof chirping crickets and David Mitchell's<br />\nbreathtaking set, we observe the mountain folk, whose simple pragmatism is<br />\noften shocking and humorous to city<br />\nsensibilities.<br />\nThe plot is very simple: one old<br />\nwoman holding tenaciously to her land<br />\nand her old way of life, pitted against<br />\na greedy, polyester-clad land buyerand<br />\na son who wants her to leave the mountain because he worries about her being<br />\nall alone. But we find out that the old<br />\nwoman, Annie Nations (beautifully portrayed by Jessica Tandy), is not quite<br />\nalone: she is kept company by the ghost<br />\nof her dead husband Hector, played by<br />\nCronyn. This situation provides the play<br />\nwith a great deal of its humor, since only<br />\nAnnie can see Hector.<br />\nThe theme of the play is blatant:<br /><br />\nthemselkes to interpretation, and like<br />\nmany of Bob Dylan's, they often sound<br />\njust as good when sung by someone else.<br />\nHowever, it is hard to imagine anyone<br />\nbut Springsteen singing the songs on<br />\nNebraska, his new acoustic album.<br />\nLaid down on Springsteen's own<br />\nfour-track recorder, the ten cuts feature<br />\nan occasional tambourine and synthesizer to go along with guitar and harmonica.

But unlike the former's<br />\n\"Factory,\" for example, which Sprin s-<br /><br />\nstate<br />\nI'm a sergeant out of Perrineville barracks number 8<br />\nI always done an honest job as honest<br />\nas I could<br />\nI got a brother named Franky and<br />\nFranky ain't no good<br />\nWhen he abandons such personae,<br />\nSpringsteen indulges in the platitudes<br />\nthat have marred much of his recent<br />\nwork. With its stereotypical treatment<br />\nof' life's hardships, \"Reason to<br />\nBelieve,\" the album's last cut, comes off<br />\nmore humorously than such purposely<br />\nridiculous sonr's as \"I'm a Rocker\"<br /><br />\nchange. The characters talk about how<br />\nthe landscape is changing as a result of<br />\nsuburban sprawl, and they talk about<br />\nhow things were in the old days. For example, Annie says that back then,<br />\n\"when folks gets married they stay married.\" Hector and Annie were married<br />\nfor 62 years, but Dillard Nations, their<br />\ncountry-singer son (Keith Carradine) is<br />\nin the process of divorcing his wife, who<br />\njust left him for another man. The<br />\nflashbacks used to contrast past and present are somewhat jarring, because the<br />\ncharacters stay in the same costumes and<br />\nmake-up for the flashbacks. In one<br />\nscene, Annie, hunched and decrepit,<br />\ntells her son how she met his father. The<br />\nlighting changes to indicate the change<br />\nin time, and suddenly Annie Nations is<br />\na young girl at a hoedown, twirling<br />\nacross the stage in her orthopedic shoes.<br />\nOverall, this is a delightful play.

However, the two losses<br />\nwere both at the hands of Division I opponents.<br />\nThe Blue Jays played a tough<br />\n1-1 overtime draw with<br />\nCatholic University Saturday,<br />\nSeptember 25, at Homewood<br />\nfield.

Professional sports are not just fun<br />\nand games, but are big business<br />\ninvolving lots of money, where<br />\nthe action between lawyers,<br />\nlabor negotiators and agents is<br />\nas important as the action between the players. If one really<br />\nwants to know how the home<br />\nteam is faring, better check the<br />\nfinancial section of the paper as<br />\nwell as the sports.<br />\nAt the present time, the<br />\nowners and players are in a<br />\ndeadlock, one that, it now appears likely, will force the<br />\ncancellation of the season. The<br />\nowners had talked of fielding<br />\nteams of strike-breaking players<br />\nand free agents, but they have<br />\nmade no moves in that direcion<br />\nand now seem inclined to simply close down for the duration<br />\nof the strike. The main stumbling block no longer appears to<br />\nbe one of money (the owners<br />\nhave reportedly offered 1.6<br /><br />\nbillion dollars over five years,<br />\nand the players reportedly want<br />\nthe same amount over four<br />\nyears), but of control. The<br />\nunion wants player salaries tied<br />\nto revenue, at last report fifty<br />\npercent of T.V. revenues, and<br />\nit wants to end individual<br />\nbargaining, having the money<br />\ngiven to the union instead,<br />\nwhich would distribute it to the<br />\nplayers on the basis of seniority and performance. These proposals would place the players<br />\non the payroll of the union,<br />\nrather than the team's, and<br />\nforce the owners to open their<br />\nbooks to the union, consequences which are unacceptable<br />\nto the owners.<br />\nWhat is the outlook? Forget<br />\nabout the NFL this year. Unless<br />\nsomeone gives soon, which<br />\nseems unlikely, Rozelle will<br />\nhave to cancel the season, leaving the fans with Canadian and<br />\ncollege football and Super Bowl<br />\nreruns.

Ellen Abramson shot in<br />\nthe only score early on in the<br />\nfirst half. After this point, the<br />\nfirst half seemed to be<br />\ndominated by Notre Dame, but<br />\nthe Jay's defense remained<br />\nsolid, and did not let them into<br />\ngoal territory. The second half<br />\nopened on a drive by Hopkins.<br />\nAgain Notre Dame took<br />\npossession, though both teams<br />\nseemed to be controlling the<br />\nball equally. Hopkins ran some<br />\nbeautiful plays and had some<br />\nhard drives, but was unable to<br />\nput the ball in for another<br />\nscore.

But that is not all.<br />\nCoach Ciccarone also uses it to<br />\nindoctrinate the freshmen and<br />\ntransfers into the system; to see<br />\nwhat they can do and who can<br />\nhelp the team in the spring. It<br />\nis a time when the coaching<br />\nstaff can work more with the<br />\nyounger players, as seniors and<br />\nmost juniors do not play. The<br />\ncoaches are out to evaluate the<br />\nnewcomers, and to see how far<br />\nthe sophsimores have progressed since last year. They stress<br />\nand work on fundamentals,<br />\nsuch as stickhandling, throwing<br />\nand catching. The players are<br />\nout to improve themselves and<br />\nshow what they can do. Losing<br />\nand winning are not that important; as Coach Ciccarone says:<br />\n\"It is a time for players to get<br /><br />\nto know the system and improve on basics. But you can't<br />\nget too intense; all the pressure<br />\nis on during spring.\"<br />\nNevertheless, this is not to<br />\nsay that the players are not concerned wilh winning, as<br />\nevidenced during the scrimmage against the Maryland<br />\nLacrosse Club.
