Goldberg, explaining<br />\nhis autumn error of omission, stated that he \"simply hadn't<br />\nrealized the existence of a problem.\" There is much merit to<br />\nGoldberg's explanation. The jobs of a June Week chairman<br />\nare many and detailed, and problems can escape his attention,<br />\nespecially when there is no earlier record of having met the<br />\nJune Week segregation question squarely.<br />\nThe June Week chairman's speed in correcting the mistake<br />\nhas made it possible for Hopkins' Negro students to attend every<br />\nJune Week function, although some restrictions (minor when<br />\ncompared to the Lord Baltimore's absolute no-Negro stand) still<br />\nexist.<br />\nUnfortunately, however, not all persons concerned with<br />\nthe problem agreed with Goldberg's'policy of speed and action. Some campus leaders, contacted at the beginning of the<br />\nhectic half-week which ensued after the June Week sites<br />\nexpressed their feelings on the segregation question, advised<br />\nthat the problem be treated quietly, dealt with in class meetings and committees, held off in the hope that things would<br />\nbe different next year. The prevailing attitude was, \"Nothing<br />\ncan be done this year. Work slowly and quietly. In that way,<br />\nperhaps the situation can be changed. Above all, no publicity.\"<br />\nIn fact, in one case at least the attitude was one of complete<br />\napathy and hopelessness. One leader of the class, the only one<br />\nwho had thought of the segregation problem, stated that he had<br />\nknown of it because of previous experience, but had said nothing<br />\nbecause he \"knew nothing could be done.\" He said, \"The policy<br />\nhas been to let sleeping dogs lie.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThis what's-the-use attitude\u2014,this policy of \"Don't make<br />\n<br />\na fuss; nothing will come of it but trouble.\"\u2014has been<br />\n<br />\nproven wrong, at least in the Lord Baltimore-Alcazar case. If<br />\nno fuss had been made\u2014if the problem, which was one of<br />\nimmediacy as well as one of the future, had been channeled<br />\nthrough committees, perhaps to be forgotten again next year<br />\nin the frenzy of first-term June Week preparation\u2014no ballroom changes would have been made. The rights and privileges of Negro students as members of the Hopkins community would have been overlooked again, as they have been<br />\noverlooked in June Week preparations since the first Negro<br />\nundergraduate student received his degree in the late 1940's.<br />\nWe hope that this June Week Committee's final action of<br />\nprocuring non-segregated halls will be emulated by future members of the Hopkins community. We also hope, on a larger scale,<br />\nthat a positive viewpoint and a deep-rooted concern for the<br />\nrights of others will become to an even larger degree than currently the forces motivating Hopkins student actions.<br />\n<br />\nCORRESPONDENCE<br />\nTHE OBSERVER SPEAKS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn the last couple of years at<br />\nHopkins, several new publications<br />\nhave come upon the scene\u2014The<br />\nSDA Bulletin, The Check List, The<br />\nObserver, etc. Some of them have<br />\npublished continuously, others on<br />\nand ,off, and some have been forced<br />\nout of circulation because. of disagreements with the student bosses. This is in a way unfortunate<br />\nas a campus the size and type of<br />\nHomewood needs more than a few<br />\npublications. The reason for this<br />\nis simple. Only a few different<br />\ntypes of features can be obtained<br />\nby the reading student from only<br />\na few publications. In short, Hopkins needs more student publications, not less.<br />\nThe Observer Syndicate which<br />\nhas been recently pUblishing The<br />\nCheck List has now decided that<br />\nthis situation can bg corrected. The<br />\nbiggest trouble with publishing is<br />\nthe heavy costs involved. However,<br />\nthe Observer Syndicate as a subsidiary of the Hopkins Young Republican Club has decided that an<br />\nexcellently prepared publication<br />\nwith a strictly limited circulation<br />\nis better than none at all. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that<br />\nThe Observer Syndicate announces<br />\nthe reestablishment of The Observer in a new form\u2014the magazine<br />\nform.<br />\nThe Observer will publish at intervals of about once every three<br />\nweeks starting during the orientation period of the coming new<br />\nacademic year in September. Due<br />\nto the very heavy costs of bringing out a large issue each time,<br />\nthere will be no public places<br />\nwhere the publication can be picked<br />\nup by anyone. Instead, a new system of mailed subscription service<br />\nis being started. It will work like<br />\nthis. Sooner or later almost everyone will receive a card asking them<br />\nif they wish to be an Observer<br />\nsubscriber. If they return the card<br />\nto The Observer then they will be<br />\nput on the active mailing list to<br />\nreceive all the coming issues.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that The Observer cannot use the normal system<br />\nof distribution, but this is, just<br />\ntoo high in costs. It is expected<br />\nthat within the first weeks of<br />\nOctober, a waiting list will be<br />\nestablished to contain the names of<br />\nthose who have requested mailed<br />\nsubscription service but who are<br />\nnot able to get on the active list<br />\nbecause of the very low maximum<br />\ncirculation figure..<br />\nAt the present time, a staff is<br />\nbeing created so that the new publication can bring to the student<br />\nthe very best writing am' execution<br />\nin production methods. New and<br />\nspeedy techniques have already<br />\nbeen decided on in printing type<br />\nand color covers. Within the next<br />\nfew days, the individuals working<br />\non the new staff will be announced as well as other facts<br />\nabout the content of this old publication in a new form.

Ed Habermann<br />\nand Ronnie Creamer, who had<br />\npreviously defeated their opponents at Hopkins, were easily subdued in two set matches. Also<br />\ngoing down via the straight-set<br />\nroute in singles were Herb Butler, Pete Bower, and sophomore<br />\nDan Switky.<br />\nIn doubles, the Jay mentor tried<br />\nout a new combination of Ed<br />\nHabermann and Danny Switky at<br />\nsecond doubles, but the home duo<br />\nwas too powerful and easily<br />\ntopped the Jays. The number one<br />\ncombo of Greenberg and Bower<br />\nwere easily demolished by the<br />\nGreyhound one and two men. The<br />\nBlue Jays' juniors made numerous<br />\nmistakes, and the Loyola aces<br />\nconsistently passed them at the<br />\nnet. In the final doubles match<br />\nof the afternoon, Claude Barfield<br />\nand Joe Pedorella were humbled<br />\nby the home team, 6-2 and 6-1.<br />\n<br />\nFrosh Netters<br />\nClose Season<br />\nThe Blue Jay Freshmen tennis<br />\nteam, coached by Varsity mentor<br />\nFred Steinmann ended the season<br />\nwith a one win-four loss record.<br />\nThe Jays novices were beaten<br />\nby powerful Forest Park, Poly,<br />\nGilman, and City, and won their<br />\nlone match from Baltimore Junior<br />\nCollege. The team was led by<br />\nDon Squair, who showed some top<br />\nform as the season progressed,<br />\naccording to Coach Steinman<br />\nThe Frosh opened with a shutout loss to Forest Park, 8-0. Their<br />\nsecond opponent, Poly, nosed out<br />\nthe Jays, 5-4, as did the third<br />\nopponent, Gilman. The yearlings<br />\nthen jumped into the win column<br />\nrouting Baltimore Junior College,<br />\n8-1, before dropping their final<br />\nmatch to City, 6-3. Although posting a losing season, Coach Steinmann feels that this year's team<br />\nhas some fine Varsity prospects.<br />\n<br />\nnot too bad. This shows that wo<br />\nfinal scori<br />\nlost to a strong Navy team, 13-3. are not as bad as the outstand'<br />\nthe<br />\nJay mentor, Bob Scott summed up indicated.

Goldberg, explaining<br />\nhis autumn error of omission, stated that he \"simply hadn't<br />\nrealized the existence of a problem.\" There is much merit to<br />\nGoldberg's explanation. The jobs of a June Week chairman<br />\nare many and detailed, and problems can escape his attention,<br />\nespecially when there is no earlier record of having met the<br />\nJune Week segregation question squarely.<br />\nThe June Week chairman's speed in correcting the mistake<br />\nhas made it possible for Hopkins' Negro students to attend every<br />\nJune Week function, although some restrictions (minor when<br />\ncompared to the Lord Baltimore's absolute no-Negro stand) still<br />\nexist.<br />\nUnfortunately, however, not all persons concerned with<br />\nthe problem agreed with Goldberg's'policy of speed and action. Some campus leaders, contacted at the beginning of the<br />\nhectic half-week which ensued after the June Week sites<br />\nexpressed their feelings on the segregation question, advised<br />\nthat the problem be treated quietly, dealt with in class meetings and committees, held off in the hope that things would<br />\nbe different next year. The prevailing attitude was, \"Nothing<br />\ncan be done this year. Work slowly and quietly. In that way,<br />\nperhaps the situation can be changed. Above all, no publicity.\"<br />\nIn fact, in one case at least the attitude was one of complete<br />\napathy and hopelessness. One leader of the class, the only one<br />\nwho had thought of the segregation problem, stated that he had<br />\nknown of it because of previous experience, but had said nothing<br />\nbecause he \"knew nothing could be done.\" He said, \"The policy<br />\nhas been to let sleeping dogs lie.\"<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThis what's-the-use attitude\u2014,this policy of \"Don't make<br /><br />\na fuss; nothing will come of it but trouble.\"\u2014has been<br /><br />\nproven wrong, at least in the Lord Baltimore-Alcazar case. If<br />\nno fuss had been made\u2014if the problem, which was one of<br />\nimmediacy as well as one of the future, had been channeled<br />\nthrough committees, perhaps to be forgotten again next year<br />\nin the frenzy of first-term June Week preparation\u2014no ballroom changes would have been made. The rights and privileges of Negro students as members of the Hopkins community would have been overlooked again, as they have been<br />\noverlooked in June Week preparations since the first Negro<br />\nundergraduate student received his degree in the late 1940's.<br />\nWe hope that this June Week Committee's final action of<br />\nprocuring non-segregated halls will be emulated by future members of the Hopkins community. We also hope, on a larger scale,<br />\nthat a positive viewpoint and a deep-rooted concern for the<br />\nrights of others will become to an even larger degree than currently the forces motivating Hopkins student actions.<br /><br />\nCORRESPONDENCE<br />\nTHE OBSERVER SPEAKS<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn the last couple of years at<br />\nHopkins, several new publications<br />\nhave come upon the scene\u2014The<br />\nSDA Bulletin, The Check List, The<br />\nObserver, etc. Some of them have<br />\npublished continuously, others on<br />\nand ,off, and some have been forced<br />\nout of circulation because. of disagreements with the student bosses. This is in a way unfortunate<br />\nas a campus the size and type of<br />\nHomewood needs more than a few<br />\npublications. The reason for this<br />\nis simple. Only a few different<br />\ntypes of features can be obtained<br />\nby the reading student from only<br />\na few publications. In short, Hopkins needs more student publications, not less.<br />\nThe Observer Syndicate which<br />\nhas been recently pUblishing The<br />\nCheck List has now decided that<br />\nthis situation can bg corrected. The<br />\nbiggest trouble with publishing is<br />\nthe heavy costs involved. However,<br />\nthe Observer Syndicate as a subsidiary of the Hopkins Young Republican Club has decided that an<br />\nexcellently prepared publication<br />\nwith a strictly limited circulation<br />\nis better than none at all. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that<br />\nThe Observer Syndicate announces<br />\nthe reestablishment of The Observer in a new form\u2014the magazine<br />\nform.<br />\nThe Observer will publish at intervals of about once every three<br />\nweeks starting during the orientation period of the coming new<br />\nacademic year in September. Due<br />\nto the very heavy costs of bringing out a large issue each time,<br />\nthere will be no public places<br />\nwhere the publication can be picked<br />\nup by anyone. Instead, a new system of mailed subscription service<br />\nis being started. It will work like<br />\nthis. Sooner or later almost everyone will receive a card asking them<br />\nif they wish to be an Observer<br />\nsubscriber. If they return the card<br />\nto The Observer then they will be<br />\nput on the active mailing list to<br />\nreceive all the coming issues.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that The Observer cannot use the normal system<br />\nof distribution, but this is, just<br />\ntoo high in costs. It is expected<br />\nthat within the first weeks of<br />\nOctober, a waiting list will be<br />\nestablished to contain the names of<br />\nthose who have requested mailed<br />\nsubscription service but who are<br />\nnot able to get on the active list<br />\nbecause of the very low maximum<br />\ncirculation figure..<br />\nAt the present time, a staff is<br />\nbeing created so that the new publication can bring to the student<br />\nthe very best writing am' execution<br />\nin production methods. New and<br />\nspeedy techniques have already<br />\nbeen decided on in printing type<br />\nand color covers. Within the next<br />\nfew days, the individuals working<br />\non the new staff will be announced as well as other facts<br />\nabout the content of this old publication in a new form.
