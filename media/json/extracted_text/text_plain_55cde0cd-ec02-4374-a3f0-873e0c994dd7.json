Last year, tuition<br />\nshot up $800 as it did the year before that.<br />\nIn fact, tuition has increased at a rate of six<br />\npercent or more, per year, for the last thirteen years, and according to University officials, there's no reason to hope that that<br />\ntrend will change very much in the immediate future.<br />\nSo, all things considered, the size and<br />\ntiming of the hike seemed to be quite<br />\npredictable.<br />\nWhat was equally predictable was the<br />\nAdministration's defense of the increase.<br />\nAs usual, Muller came to the Council<br />\nmeeting armed with a list of the tuition<br />\ncharged at 106 other colleges and universities. He was happy to point out that<br />\nHopkins was about fiftieth on the list, all<br />\ncosts considered.<br />\nMuller's list is always interesting and hits<br />\na soft spot in most students. (Almost<br />\neveryone at Hopkins revels in comparisons<br />\nof universities a la Barron's Guide.)<br />\nBut such lists hardly provide a justification for tuition increases. We believe<br />\nthere's no reason to compare Hopkins with<br />\nother schools when tuition decisions are<br />\nmade. Hopkins ought to assess its own<br />\nfinancial needs and resources, make its<br />\ndecision, and justify it regardless of the<br />\n<br />\nprices charged elsewhere. After all, comparing tuition rates among universities<br />\nwith the purpose of justifying one's own<br />\ntuition is a little like justifying tax increases<br />\nby quoting the tax rates paid in other countries. It doesn't mean very much.<br />\nIn fact, there probably are good reasons<br />\nfor increasing tuition. But those reasons<br />\nbarely surfaced at the Council meeting.<br />\nDespite the similarities in Muller's<br />\npresentation of the tuition increase this year<br />\nto those of years past, there was one striking difference. Wednesday's meeting was<br />\nthe first meeting in three years at which<br />\nMuller broke the news of the size of the<br />\nincrease to Council. We commend him for<br />\ndoing so.<br />\nLast year, we asked Muller about a possible tuition increase, and he released the size<br />\nof the hike to us weeks before he appeared<br />\nat Council. And in 1985, Muller tipped off<br />\nJon Lana, then Student Council president,<br />\nin advance.<br />\nThis year, Muller apparently decided to<br />\nreturn to the tradition of breaking the news<br />\nat a Council meeting itself.<br />\nOf course, we appreciate getting scoops<br />\nlike the tuition increase last year and won't<br />\ncomplain if it happens again. But, the Student Council is the elected representative<br />\norganization of the undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins, and should therefore be the first<br />\nto be formally informed of decisions like<br />\nan $800 tuition increase. Clearly, notifying Council is the most diplomatic way to<br />\nrelease the news of an increase.<br />\nAs the initial din caused by the announcement of the tuition increase subsides, the<br />\nhike will likely be soon forgotten. Nevertheless, the Administration owes the<br />\nstudents who will foot the bill a more complete account of the reasons for the increase. Specifically, a report detailing the<br />\nrising expenses of operating the University should be presented to Council.<br />\nOnly then will students be able to make<br />\nsome reasonable conclusions about the<br />\nnecessity of a tuition increase.<br />\n<br />\nSnaring a Speaker<br />\nThe issue of commencement speakers is<br />\nalways a touchy one. No matter how<br />\nfamous or infamous a given speaker may<br />\nbe, there are sure to be those among the<br />\nSenior Class who will complain. This year,<br />\nhowever, we suspect that the complainers<br />\nwill be fewer and farther between than in<br />\nrecent years, thanks in large measure to the<br />\nwork of the Graduation Speaker<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nAfter nearly four months of hard work,<br />\nthe committee managed to snare sportswriter and announcer Howard Cosell for<br />\nthe afternoon convocation ceremony. All<br />\nthe members of the Senior Class should be<br />\npleased.<br />\nIn recent years, the \"prestige\" of the<br />\nSenior Class speakers has vacillated<br />\ndramatically. In '84, William F. Buckley,<br />\nJr. graced the ceremony; in '85, actor John<br />\nHouseman took the podium; and in '86,<br />\noceanographer Roger Revelle gave the<br />\nsenior address. While all three speakers<br />\nperformed well, Senior Class morale seemed to be particularly high at the speech of<br />\nthe most famous of the three.<br />\n<br />\nThis year, the ceremony seems destined<br />\nfor the same success as Graduation '84.<br />\nCommencement will feature a \"brandname\" Senior Class speaker with wide appeal; and a morning speaker, Vartan<br />\nGregorian, the president of the New York<br />\nPublic Library, who will likely provide an<br />\ninteresting speech as well.<br />\nConsidering the fiscal restraints imposed on the Graduation Speaker Committee,<br />\nattracting a speaker of Cosell's fame must<br />\nhave been no easy endeavor. In an age<br />\nwhen a well-known speaker can clear a<br />\nfive-digit salary for a one-hour lecture, the<br />\n$2,500 honorarium offered by the senior<br />\nclass could hardly serve as bait for most<br />\nspeakers. Without considerable generosity on the part of the speaker and diplomacy<br />\non the part of the Graduation Speaker Committee, it would be impossible to imagine<br />\nattracting a lecturer of Cosell's stature.<br />\nThis year, we look forward to an interesting commencement ceremony and<br />\ncommend the Graduation Speaker Committee for tackling a difficult job and<br />\nprevailing.<br />\n<br />\nAs President of the Student<br />\nCouncil, I thought it might be<br />\nhelpful to clear the air and give<br />\nyou an idea ofjust what is going<br />\non with your Student Council and<br />\ncampus.<br />\nTo assuage any fears about the<br />\nHOP's ability to book rooms, I<br />\nhave personally investigated the<br />\nsituation and been assured that<br />\nthere has been no oversight by the<br />\nHOP or the Social Committee<br />\nwith regard to social program-<br />\n<br />\nI suggest we explore the upgraded system to its fullest extent<br />\nbefore demanding further<br />\nmodification.<br />\nWith regard to communication<br />\nand freedoms of expression, I applaud the News-Letter's coverage<br />\nof the report of the Committee on<br />\nFreedom of Expression. For that<br />\nmatter, the News-Letter has,<br />\noverall, done one of the best jobs<br />\nI've seen in the last four years.<br />\nHowever, nothing is without<br />\n<br />\nmark komisky<br />\ning this semester.<br />\nThe SAC Seals committee is<br />\ndue to report in the coming<br />\nweeks. While many would like to<br />\neliminate the Seals altogether,<br />\nothers still feel it is appropriate<br />\nto recognize those seniors with<br />\noutstanding contributions to student activities on this campus.<br />\nI'm afraid both I, personally, and<br />\nthe Council seem torn over the<br />\nissue and eagerly await the committee's report.<br />\nSecurity has greatly improved<br />\nat Homewood in recent years.<br />\nWith the additions in lighting,<br />\nsecurity phones, and additional<br />\nmonitors on the quads and in the<br />\ndorms it should have been obvious that the next expansion<br />\nmust be to obtain another shuttle.<br />\nUnfortunately, the issue was<br />\nsimply never raised before. With<br />\nthe addition of another van,<br />\nhopefully the system will accommodate students' needs. While<br />\nI empathize and for the most part<br />\nagree that the University should<br />\ntake a greater interest in and<br />\nresponsibility for its students, I do<br />\nnot think a JHU taxi service in<br />\nand around Homewood is possible, logistically or economically.<br />\n<br />\nfaults (including Hopkins<br />\nstudents) but those that do their<br />\nbest deserve some credit.

Wu<br />\nThe desire to take an afternoon<br />\nnap is a sign of maturity, as<br />\nchildren, with their lack of<br />\nforesight, fight until exhaustion to<br />\navoid the pleasure, and adults, if<br />\nthey think for a moment, realize<br />\nthat while anybody can do lunch,<br />\nonly the mighty may then sleep.<br />\nFor the past several years, I have<br />\npursued the perfect nap, and am<br />\ncloser to momentary bliss than<br />\nwhen I first started.<br />\nSleeping in class is worse than<br />\nnot sleeping. Not only is it rude,<br />\nbut it rarely gets past a few jerks<br />\nof the head without leading to<br />\nsnoring, drooling, falling out of<br />\nthe chair, or some other atrocity.<br />\nFor their foolishness, people<br />\nsleeping in class deserve to be<br />\nwhacked on the head, or at least<br />\nnoticed and made fun of. The real<br />\npower nap must take place in a<br />\ncomfortable environment. More<br />\nimportantly, it must take place in<br />\nprivate.<br />\nThe length of the nap would<br />\nseem to be the most important<br />\nvariable, but if it is to be a nap<br />\nat all it should not exceed half an<br />\nhour, or forty-five minutes at<br />\nmost. Anything longer is probably the result of exhaustion and<br />\nwhen I wake from a three or four<br />\nhour slumber, the entire day or<br />\nnight is ruined, as well as my<br />\nsleep schedule for the rest of the<br />\nweek. After all, the purpose of a<br />\nnap is to relax and then perhaps<br />\nreturn to work, not to collapse<br />\nand struggle back to a sleepinduced stupor.<br />\nSetting the alarm clock is easy<br />\nenough. Setting the thermostat is<br />\nnot at all easy. If the room is<br />\nwarm I will feel more tired and<br />\ntake longer to fall asleep than if<br />\nthe room is cool. After falling<br />\nasleep I will probably have a<br />\nnightmare, wake up, feel<br />\nmiserable and still tired, and fall<br />\nasleep again for another<br />\nnightmare, usually about<br />\nneglected work. Only if the room<br />\nis just cool enough are naps<br />\nrefreshing.<br />\nOf course, waking is the biggest problem. Waking poorly can<br />\nmake the entire experience a<br />\nwaste of time. If the timing is off,<br />\nwaking can leave a person too<br />\nhyped-up to go back to whatever<br />\n<br />\nthey were doing. This seems to<br />\nhappen when the nap is too short:<br />\nit is just enough to give a person<br />\na jolt of random energy, and this<br />\nwill throw them off and give them<br />\ninsomnia later. If the nap is too<br />\nlong, or the waking process is<br />\ndrawn out, the nap will turn out<br />\nto be completely useless, a draining of energy, leaving the napper<br />\nmore tired than when he started.<br />\nThe perfect nap comes down to<br />\na few minor details and perfect<br />\nawakening. This should come just<br />\nbefore the alarm clock is about to<br />\nstart up, to give the illusion of<br />\nfreedom (\"I can sleep as long as<br />\nI want\"), and it should take only<br />\na second to snap to a fully functional state. When carried off in<br />\nthis form, the nap will sometimes<br />\ninclude a special bonus, an idea<br />\nfor a story, the solution to a puzzle, or the sudden desire to do<br />\nsomething. The best naps are<br />\ninspiring.<br />\nAnd then there are dreams.<br />\nSuperstition has it that I cannot<br />\ndream my own death, but I have:<br />\nhiding in a fireplace, in a room<br />\nwith dust wooden floor, in a<br />\nmystical valley filled with people<br />\non horseback in Asian armor, a<br />\nman with a mustache pointed a fat<br />\nchrome musket at my face; I<br />\nContinued on Page 10<br />\n<br />\nLetter Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editor.

For the<br />\nundergraduate population at<br />\nHopkins, those figures work out<br />\nto 200 gays and possibly 500<br />\nbisexuals.<br />\nGALA\u2014the Gay and Lesbian<br />\nAlliance\u2014is the response of conscientious and concerned people<br />\nto this situation. The group's purpose, according to president<br />\nJoshua Stuart is twofold. First,<br />\nthey provide support for gays<br />\nwho are coming out\u2014not actually making public, but rather ceasing to hide their sexuality. This<br />\ntransition may be extremely difficult emotionally and many gays<br />\nare unable to make it on their<br />\nown. \"Their self-esteem has been<br />\nso beaten down that they can't get<br />\nup the courage to meet other people who can help them,\" says<br />\nStuart. He emphasizes \"the need<br />\nto reach out and let people know<br />\nthat other gay people exist.\" The<br />\nprocess of coming out is further<br />\n<br />\ncomplicated by social pressures;<br />\n\"It's not uncommon for parents<br />\nto beat their (gay) children,<br />\nspecifically for fathers to beat<br />\ntheir gay daughters.\" And what<br />\nabout the job environment? \"People get fired every day (for being<br />\ngay),\" says Stuart. \"It's sad, but<br />\nit happens. All the time.\"<br />\nGALA's other main function is<br />\nthe education of the straight community about gays and the gay<br />\ncommunity. \"I think that educa-<br />\n<br />\ntion is the key to understanding<br />\nand acceptance,\" says Stuart, and<br />\nhe stresses the fact that the issue<br />\nmust be humanized for the educational approach to be successful.<br />\n\"The biggest problem is that it is<br />\ndifficult to humanize an un-<br />\n<br />\nfamiliar issue in a coherent, rational way.\" He gives an example: \"All kinds of people who<br />\nhave real problems with gays are<br />\nchanged completely when they<br />\nrealize that their brother or their<br />\nbest friend, or maybe a parent, is<br />\ngay. Then the problem is<br />\nhumanized, then they can see<br />\nhow stupid their bias is.\" Of<br />\ncourse not everyone will have this<br />\nsort of contact, so the problem<br />\nremains.<br />\nThe Alliance has been well<br />\nsupported by the administration in<br />\nboth of these purposes. \"The administration has been great, to the<br />\nextent that the administration as<br />\nfar as we deal with it is Mary<br />\nEllen Porter and Andrea Perry,\"<br />\nsays Stuart. This year, a<br />\nrepresentative for the Alliance<br />\nmet with all of the Housemasters<br />\nin order to educate them on the<br />\nspecial problems of gay<br />\nfreshmen. \"Statistically, there<br />\nare between 60 and 70 gays in the<br />\nfreshman dorms, and the<br />\nHousemasters need to know how<br />\nto help them, and where to send<br />\nthem for help they're not<br />\nqualified to give.\" In that func-<br />\n<br />\ntion, the support service for gays,<br />\n\"the White House has been very<br />\ngood in regards to their sensitivity<br />\nto the gay community,\" says<br />\nStuart.<br />\nThe Alliance has meetings,<br />\nopen to the public, on the first<br />\nTuesday of every month at 5:00<br />\np.m. in the basement of Levering.<br />\nThe meetings serve primarily a<br />\nbusiness function. Additionally,<br />\nthere is a \"rap group\" which<br />\nmeets in Conference Room A \"to<br />\n<br />\ngive gay students a chance to<br />\nmeet other people as well as a<br />\nchance to talk about gay<br />\nconcerns.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the main<br />\ntopics of discussion, and<br />\nspecifically whether AIDS is<br />\n<br />\ndiscussed at the rap sessions,<br />\nStuart responds, \"On a few occasions, yes. Primarily the<br />\ndiscussion is about our own personal fears [concerning the<br />\ndisease]. It's important that we<br />\nlearn to go on living, that we not<br />\nstop our lives out of fear.\" He<br />\nadds, \"It is a mistake to think of<br />\nAIDS as a gay disease merely<br />\nbecause it started in the gay commUnity. AIDS is not selective.<br />\nFor the time being it is primarily<br />\na concern of the gay community<br />\nbecause that's where it's most<br />\nprominent. That's changing<br />\nquickly, though, as the disease<br />\nspreads. You can pick up a<br />\nNewsweek and you'll find an ad<br />\nfor condoms, and it will talk<br />\nabout how AIDS is not a gay<br />\ndisease.\"<br />\nAsked if there was anything<br />\nelse the public should be more<br />\naware of, Stuart responds, \"Yes.<br />\nThe difference between the word<br />\ngay and the term homosexual.<br />\nHomosexual is a very clinical<br />\nword, and as a label, it is applied<br />\nto us by others. We call ourselves<br />\ngay, not homosexual.\"<br />\n<br />\nDebate Continues<br />\nParlous Precedent<br />\nby Howard Zachary Robbins<br />\nA popular vision of Hell is that<br />\nof constant discord and argument.<br />\nTo a Hopkins debater, Heaven<br />\ncould not be better described.<br />\n1987 marks the sixth year of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Parliamentary<br />\nDebate Council, but debate at<br />\nHopkins enjoys a far lengthier<br />\nhistory than that. Woodrow<br />\nWilson, when he was a graduate<br />\nstudent at Hopkins, felt the need<br />\nfor a forum to debate current<br />\nissues on campus. From that<br />\norganization, The House of Commons [featured elsewhere on<br />\nthese pages], was spawned a<br />\ndebate team that competed on an<br />\ninter-collegiate level. Until 1982<br />\nit was on-topic debate, with<br />\nresearched topics, that Hopkins<br />\ndebaters pursued at Homewood.<br />\nInterest in this factual debate<br />\nflagged, though, so the<br />\nparliamentary form of debate<br />\npopular in Canada and Great Britain was introduced to Hopkins<br />\nstudents still determined to spend<br />\ntheir time arguing.<br />\nIf debate brings to mind stern<br />\narguments over nuclear war and<br />\nabortion, then \"parliamentary<br />\ndebate\" would seem a foreign<br />\nterm. A resolution, usually a line<br />\nfrom a poem, book, song, or even<br />\ngraffiti, is read to the team randomly assigned to present the<br />\ncase ten minutes before the case<br />\nmust be presented. What this<br />\nwhole process boils down to is<br />\nthat in ten brief minutes, the duo<br />\nmust come up with some<br />\ndebatable proposal for another<br />\ntwo-member team to oppose. The<br />\nresult, both teams hope, is a genuinely amusing yet convincing<br />\nargument to sway the judge(s)<br />\ntoward their point of view.<br />\n<br />\nA debater's ultimate goal is<br />\n\"hardware\"\u2014trophies, silver<br />\nplates and wooden gavels to cart<br />\nback from tournaments and hang<br />\non walls. To acquire these dandy<br />\nitems, debaters must prove to<br />\njudges in five rounds of debate<br />\nover two days that they have won<br />\nthe arguments, and have been<br />\nmore eloquent in the process.<br />\nThough the quantification of<br />\none's speaking ability is a difficult<br />\nendeavor, judges must do so on<br />\nthe scoring ballots. Speakers are<br />\nrated on a scale of one to thirty,<br />\nbut most scores range in the low<br />\n20's.<br />\nThe hope of hardware and the<br />\nthrill of inter-collegiate competition has increased the ranks of the<br />\n<br />\nactive members today. The dreams<br />\nof trophies have certainly not<br />\ngone unrealized. The Fall of '86<br />\nbrought fifteen trophies to<br />\nHomewood from tournaments at<br />\nUMBC, Penn and Columbia.<br />\nHopkins debaters also competed<br />\nat Brown, Vassar and Harvard.<br />\n1987 is off to an optimistic start,<br />\na Hopkins team having won fifth<br />\nplace at the Goucher debate tournament, the first of the semester.<br />\nAll trophies, however, are not<br />\ncreated equal. The greatest honor<br />\nfor any parliamentary debater is<br />\nto win at the World Debate Tournament, held in a different coun-<br />\n<br />\ntry every year. Since the 1984<br />\nseason, Hopkins has sent its<br />\nargumentative representatives as<br />\nfar away as Dublin, Ireland to<br />\nbattle Canadian, American,<br />\nEnglish, Irish, Scottish and<br />\nAustralian teams. Last year the<br />\nHopkins delegation won third<br />\nplace at World, better than any<br />\nother American team had done<br />\npreviously.<br />\nThe Debate Council's hopes<br />\nfor the future are stellar.<br />\nMembership is on a constant rise<br />\nand, assuming a sufficient rise in<br />\nfunding, these debaters can continue the Hopkins tradition of<br />\nhumor and victory up and down<br />\nthe East Coast and around the<br />\nglobe.<br />\nThe newly-elected President<br />\nof the Council, junior Chris<br />\nArzt, is seeking to expand the<br />\nsuccess of the team and funding<br />\nto match. A sale of fruit baskets<br />\nraised much-needed dollars for<br />\nthe Council, and other projects<br />\nare in the works. Arzt is joined<br />\nby sophomore Aneil Shirke as<br />\nVice President of Operations,<br />\nsophomore Charles Fitzgerald as<br />\nVice President of Development,<br />\nfreshman Howard Robbins as<br />\nTreasurer, and junior Eric Kane<br />\nas Secretary.<br />\nLooking forward toward<br />\nSpring, the Debate Council plans<br />\nto send teams to tournaments at<br />\nRandolph-Macon, Princeton,<br />\nNYU, Yale and Wesleyan, with<br />\nother tournaments still in question.

There was mad notetaking, frequent outbursts and<br />\ncrashes of the gavel. The debate<br />\nwas filled with amusing anecdotes<br />\n(a person shaving his head with<br />\na lawnmower) and barely veiled<br />\nstatements masquerading as questions. All the arguments<br />\nculminated in a vote which was<br />\nsomething of an anti-climax to the<br />\nheated debate. Then, the<br />\n<br />\nmembers decided on who would<br />\nwrite resolutions for the next<br />\nweek, and everyone filed out.<br />\nOne cabinet member assured<br />\nme that one need not know<br />\nParliamentary procedure to participate. Apparently, it can be<br />\npicked up fairly easily. Neither is<br />\nan eloquent speaking ability or an<br />\nup-to-the-minute knowledge of<br />\ncurrent events required. One<br />\ncould go in having completely no<br />\nidea of the meaning of the resolution and come out an enlightened<br />\nbeing. One of the members who<br />\nchose to be a nonpartisan<br />\nonlooker this time said, \"I go for<br />\nthe amusement value.\"<br />\nIn addition to the weekly<br />\ndebates, the Hopkins House of<br />\nCommons sponsors other activities. For example, they have<br />\nhad a number of\"big\" speakers,<br />\nsponsored by last year's debate<br />\nbetween the Coalition for a Free<br />\nSouth Africa and the College<br />\nRepublicans, and had crisis<br />\nsimulations.

As she was<br />\nreplacing a book onto a shelf, she<br />\nturned around and stumbled over<br />\na box.<br />\nCuriosity may have been Pandora's enemy but it did not stop<br />\nRodgers from looking into the<br />\nbox; and upon inspection, she<br />\ndiscovered over 750 unpublished<br />\nlove letters, dated between 1923<br />\nand 1935, written by Mencken<br />\nand Haardt. After Haardt's death,<br />\nMencken gave the letters to<br />\nGoucher under a 45-year restriction, a restriction that expired the<br />\nyear of Rodger's discovery.<br />\nThe discovery of the letters was<br />\njust the first step in Rodgers'<br />\nwork. After graduating from<br />\nGoucher, she received a<br />\nfellowship to do graduate work at<br />\nEmory University in Atlanta. It<br />\nwas there that she turned the love<br />\nletters into a Masters Thesis investigating the literary relationship between Mencken and<br />\nHaardt, and the role that Mencken played in instigating the<br />\nSouthern Literary Renaissance.<br />\nFor Rodgers, the ball kept rolling, and soon she was presenting<br />\nto publishers the idea of compiling the letters into a book about<br />\nMencken and Haardt.<br />\nThe entire project, including<br />\ngraduate work, took four years to<br />\ncomplete, and according to<br />\nRodgers, \"no stone was left un-<br />\n<br />\nturned.\" She interviewed people<br />\nwho knew Mencken and Haardt,<br />\nread books about the people they<br />\nknew, visited places such as<br />\nMontgomery, Alabama (Haardt's<br />\nhometown), and even ate at Mencken and Haardt's favorite<br />\nrestaurant, Marconi's.<br />\n\"There was a year of really<br />\nsolid research,\" Rodgers says. \"I<br />\nreally immersed myself in the<br />\nsubject. I really, really wanted to<br />\nbe steeped in the times, to know<br />\nwhat it was like in the<br />\n'20's. . .

He said \"bachelors know<br />\nmore about women than married<br />\nmen. If they didn't, they'd be<br />\nmarried, too.\" Yet he did not<br />\ncount on meeting and falling in<br />\nlove with Haardt, a young writer<br />\nfrom Alabama and teacher at<br />\nGoucher College.<br />\nBeing a \"modern woman\" of<br />\nthe '20's, Haardt was no believer<br />\nin marriage: she campaigned for<br />\nwomen's rights and thought that<br />\nContinued on Page 17<br />\n<br />\nON CAMPUS<br />\nMeet Members of our<br />\nTechnical Staff<br />\nMarch 6, 1987<br />\nLincoln Laboratory professionals are at the forefront of<br />\nunique Research and Development efforts across a broad<br />\nspectrum of advanced electronics technology in projects<br />\nranging from component development to the design<br />\nand construction of complex prototype syqtems.

Among its graduates<br />\nare Russell Baker, John Barth, Louis Rubin,<br />\nMary Robison and Louise Erdrich. Here are<br />\nseveral perspectives on the work of the<br />\ndepartment, including an exclusive piece by<br />\nBaker describing the founding of the<br />\nseminars by Elliott Coleman in 1946<br />\n(reprintedfrom the Writing Seminars history<br />\ncompiled by Bob Arellano, with permission<br />\nof the author).<br />\nJohn Irwin, chairman of the department<br />\nsince 1977, talks about the philosophy of<br />\nteaching writing.<br />\nWhat we mean when we talk about a<br />\nworkshop is not that kind of backslapping<br />\nagreement between people sitting around a<br />\ntable saying, \"If you like my stuff, I like your<br />\nstuff.\"<br />\nWe think of them as being a group in<br />\nwhich an older, more experienced writer sits<br />\ndown with apprentice writers and, giving<br />\nthem the benefit of his or her experience, tries<br />\nto save them a certain amount of time and<br />\nerror in progressing in their own work. And<br />\nwhen we see somebody who we think is very<br />\n<br />\ngood, as when Mary Robison was here, John<br />\nBarth put her in touch with his agent. She had<br />\na couple of stories taken by New Yorker in<br />\nthe spring of her year here. There is, I think,<br />\noften a danger of in-breeding in writing programs. It's not any more of a danger in<br />\nwriting than in other fields.<br />\nSomeone will inevitably ask incredulously, \"Do you actually think you can teach<br />\npeople to write?\" By which they always<br />\nmean, \"Do you think you can give<br />\nsomebody genius or imaginative power?\"<br />\nIt's an interesting question, because you<br />\nnever hear that question asked, say of a<br />\nmusic or a fine arts program\u2014the assumption being that because the skills you find in<br />\nmusic and fine arts are not quite as widespread as the ability to read and write,<br />\nanybody who can read and write and is gifted<br />\nwith talent, that's enough for them. Well,<br />\nthat's certainly been true in the past. but it<br />\nis also the case that some very distinguished<br />\ncontemporary writers have come out of<br />\nwriting programs: John Barth, Flannery<br />\nO'Connor, John Irving . ..<br />\nHere's the thing. Why that whole line of<br />\nquestioning comes up is because in any kind<br />\nof an imaginative art, you will find those kinds<br />\nof questions asked and those kinds of<br />\ncriticisms made because the expectation is<br />\nso high. Which is to say, to write a novel<br />\n<br />\n'Baker Recalls His Days at Hopkins<br />\nby Russell Baker<br />\n\"I was one of a very small group that<br />\nworkeu under Elliott Coleman during his<br />\nfirst year at Hopkins. There was no<br />\nWriting department then. That came later.<br />\nFor academic purposes, English literature<br />\nwas assumed at Hopkins to have ceased<br />\nwith Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Elliott<br />\ngot in by sneaking under the tent, as it<br />\nwere. During that first semester we met<br />\nat night in a room in the engineering<br />\noutlands of Maryland Hall, and to Elliott<br />\nwe must have been a dispiriting bunch.\"<br />\n\"Most of us had just returned from service in World War Two and, being<br />\nchildren of the Depression, were strongly oriented toward the urgency of making<br />\na buck. Except for two or three of the<br />\ngroup who unashamedly wrote poetry, we<br />\nwanted to succeed commercially at<br />\nwriting. Success in those days meant<br />\npublication in the old, mass-circulation<br />\nmagazines, and a good deal of our energy<br />\nwas directed toward this goal. Our models<br />\nwere Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and<br />\nThomas Wolfe, and our subject matter<br />\nconcentrated heavily on the vaporings and<br />\nadventures of disillusioned war veterans<br />\nin saloons.\"<br />\n\"Elliott's forbearance was saintly and<br />\nhis kindness unfailing. Without them, I<br />\nwould have given up what was an<br />\nunrealistic aspiration early in the day and<br />\npursued my natural destiny to become a<br />\nrailroad brakeman. Finally, however,<br />\n<br />\nRussell Baker of the New York Times<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nafter struggling through our sevenhundredth short story about disillusioned<br />\nveterans in saloons talking like Ernest<br />\nHemingway, Elliott came in one night and<br />\nquietly broke the news to us.'Hemingway<br />\nis swell,' he said, 'but he is out.'\"<br />\n\"That night he sent us away to read<br />\n\"Ulysses\" and Proust, and study a<br />\nbroader horizon. I was not a good student.<br />\nI still write Hemingway of the Papa period<br />\nbetter than Papa did, and was over 40<br />\nbefore I read \"Ulysses\" all the way<br />\nthrough. I managed it only by reading it<br />\naloud with my wife. A fine book. I am still<br />\nonly in Volume Five of Proust. My wife<br />\nfinds him a bit long-winded for family<br />\nreading.\"<br />\n<br />\nor to write a poem, as tar as the person wno s<br />\ndoing it, may seem something they're compelled to do. But the existence of a novel or<br />\na poem or any great work of art is wholly<br />\ngratuitous. Anything short of absolute success or perfection seems like an offence. One<br />\nof the things that has happened in recent<br />\nyears is this kind of all-or-nothing situation.<br />\nYou are either a genius or nothing. There<br />\nseems to be no room left for minor art. In part<br />\nit is a side-effect of the kind of hype that<br />\nadvertising does for works of art. Any book<br />\nthat comes out now, you can always find out<br />\nten people who will give you a blurb that<br />\nsays it's the greatest thing since Homer<br />\n. .. Anybody who publishes anything now<br />\nhas to be Hemingway. But that's obviously<br />\ncrazy.<br />\nJust as I don't expect everybody who gets<br />\nthe M.A. is going to end, up on the best-seller<br />\nlist, I don't expect that everybody who gets<br />\nthe B.A. is going end up with some kind of<br />\nlife-long career in writing. The best training for being a perceptive reader of any kind<br />\nof writing is the kind of training that makes<br />\nyou look at writing from the writer's point<br />\nof view. I can't guarantee that everybody<br />\nwho goes through the B.A. or the M.A. will<br />\nend up as a famous writer; I can guarantee<br />\nthat everybody who goes through ends up as<br />\nan excellent reader.<br />\nIf you ask what the undergraduate major<br />\namounts to, it amounts to really a pretty<br />\nhighly structured program that tends to embody the old liberal-arts B.A. What we have<br />\nfound in the last few years is that whereas<br />\nin the Sixties, the feeling among<br />\nundergraduates was that we want to move<br />\nfrom a more structured to a less structured<br />\nprogram, in the late Seventies and certainly<br />\nin the Eighties, the feeling on the part of the<br />\nundergraduates is that they wanted to move<br />\nfrom a less structured to a more structured<br />\nprogram.<br />\nAt Hopkins, it's traditional to think of<br />\nundergraduates as mini-graduate students. I<br />\noften think of it as less of a distinction between undergraduate and graduate students as<br />\nbetween graduate students and apprentice<br />\ngraduate students.<br />\nWhat happened at a lot of places that have<br />\nwriting programs\u2014our major competition<br />\nyou always think to be essentially, Iowa,<br />\nColumbia, Stanford and then the very strong<br />\nprogram at Washington University (that's the<br />\nup-and-coming program)\u2014that those twoyear programs took on essentially a fine-arts<br />\ndegree, the M.F.A. precisely to distinguish<br />\nit from an M.A., which fifty or sixty years<br />\nago meant one thing, but now is sort of an<br />\nintermediate degree toward a Ph.D.<br />\nWe still think of our program not so much<br />\nin the fine-arts school tradition, but in the<br />\ntradition of literature. Therefore, we've kept<br />\nthe M.A. and kept it one year. You know,<br />\nat most places, the way they do their twoyear program is they do all their coursework<br />\nin one year and in the second year, they do<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER'15<br />\n<br />\nCelebrates Forty 'Years<br />\ntheir apprentice teaching and finish their<br />\nthesis. Here we try to combine it all in one<br />\nyear, for a couple of reasons. We're small.<br />\nTherefore, it's possible for a graduate student to take a course with every person in<br />\nthe department in one year. Secondly, our<br />\nfeeling about the M.A. program has always<br />\nbeen that the person applying doesn't get in<br />\nunless they have already demonstrated a certain level of ability in their writing.<br />\nThere was a doctorate, but it was not a<br />\nwriting degree, so much as the fact that Elliot<br />\nColeman (who directed the program then)<br />\nwanted the kind of program that did give the<br />\nPh.D.; that was very much kind of the<br />\npredecessor of the Humanities Center, a<br />\nhistory of ideas, great books program. I personally don't think a Ph.D. in writing makes<br />\nmuch sense.<br />\nThe kind of apprentice writer that comes<br />\nhere is looking to make a quantum jump in<br />\nhis ability. By making it a jam-packed year,<br />\nin which they are taking courses, teaching<br />\nand doing their own writing, plus with all<br />\nof the other intellectual activity going on<br />\nhere, we have found that that kind of<br />\nalmost pressure-cooker situation is the thing<br />\nthat gets them into that intellectual ferment.<br />\nIts major area of interest has always been<br />\nfiction and poetry and it remains that. But<br />\nwhat has happened in the last ten years is<br />\nwe've added a lot of other areas, simply<br />\nbecause our sense is that good writing is<br />\ngood writing whatever kind of writing it is<br />\nand there is no kind of writing that is not in<br />\nsome sense creative. So in addition to fiction and poetry we've built up drama, took<br />\nover from the Humanities Center the film<br />\nand the video, film history, non-fiction prose,<br />\nscience writing, journalism. . . We may<br />\nat some point, because there are so many fine<br />\nLatin American writers, go in with the<br />\nHispanic and Italian Studies to sponsor a program that will bring more Latin American<br />\nwriters to the program. It's hard to say what<br />\nareas will come up. Before we added those<br />\ncourses in radio, I couldn't have predicted it.<br />\nIt's often after a program has been in existence after a while, you will look back at<br />\nits origin to understand where it stands in<br />\nrelation to its future development.<br />\nJames Boylan, graduate of the Master's<br />\nprogram, fiction writer and currently a<br />\nWriting Seminars instructor, remembers<br />\nwhat the first session of the graduate<br />\nworkshop was like.<br />\nTerrifying, you're there in this room with<br />\nall these other writers who've come from all<br />\nover the country to be there. I remember.<br />\nJohn Barth goes around and introduces<br />\neveryone, tells what they're like as writers,<br />\nand then asks everyone what books they've<br />\nread over the summer. The assumption being that all writers are reading all the time,<br />\nwhich they ought to be; by the time they<br />\nleave this place, they are. When you come<br />\nhere though, there are a lot of people who<br />\nhaven't read anything over the summer. He's<br />\n<br />\nOa<br />\n<br />\n4.<br />\n<br />\nANNIVERSARY<br />\n<br />\ngoing around the table and I see these looks<br />\nof fear. People say, \"Well, I read, uh . . .\"<br />\nOne woman said she read Huck Finn. Later,<br />\nI asked did she really read Huck Finn? She<br />\nsaid, no, she hadn't read anything in six<br />\nmonths. I asked person after person and they<br />\nall said they made something up on the spot.<br />\nI should say that, a year later, that woman<br />\nread Huck Finn. Not to always be bringing<br />\nthese stories back to a moral, but one of the<br />\nthings that you learn is not only how to be<br />\na good writer, but how to be a good reader.<br />\nSometimes that's the biggest problem. A lot<br />\nof my students\u2014I find they haven't read<br />\nanything. They all want to be famous writers<br />\nand they haven't read anything.<br />\nYou're there with John Barth, who's a<br />\npretty impressive fellow, not only as a writer<br />\nbut as a teacher. So you're sitting there and<br />\nI think everybody always feels the program's<br />\nmade a mistake in letting them in and they<br />\ndon't really know what lousy writers they<br />\nare. But that fear is one of the things that<br />\ndrives you. . .But the fact that John Barth<br />\ncalls you to ask you to come and you know<br />\nthat maybe you are on to something, maybe<br />\nyou should have more faith in yourself. Once<br />\nyou start doing that, you start to push<br />\nyourself.<br />\nYou can't underestimate the power of being in a small room for three hours a week<br />\nwith nine or ten other writers who are out<br />\nto get you\u2014usually they're out to help you<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\ntoo. There's a nice feeling of competition<br />\nthat keeps you on your toes.<br />\nIn addition to offering young writers a<br />\nplace to learn their craft, it also gives young<br />\nteachers a chance to learn how to teach.<br />\nBob Arellano, a graduate ofthe progann<br />\nin 1962 when there were but two professors,<br />\nis now himselfafaculty member.

Directed by<br />\nBob Rafelson. Produced by<br />\nHarold Schneider. Twentieth<br />\nCentury Fox Films. Rated R.<br />\nIt's a shame that amid the<br />\nhoopla over Platoon many people<br />\nwill overlook the new Bob<br />\nRafelson film, Black Widow.<br />\nRafelson's first feature, Five Easy<br />\nPieces, gave the world the most<br />\nmemorable chicken-salad scene<br />\nand linked him with that group of<br />\nyoung directors who were reenergizing American cinema in<br />\nthe early seventies, including<br />\nGeorge Lucas and Robert<br />\nAltman. Unlike Lucas and<br />\nAltman, Rafelson has managed to<br />\ncontinued producing quality<br />\nfilms. Black Widow has been<br />\ncompared to Jagged Edge, that<br />\ncourtroom mess which had all the<br />\nsuspense of a Road Runner cartoon. Black Widow is, rather, the<br />\nmost effective thriller to come<br />\naround since Blood Simple, and<br />\nlike that film, it draws from the<br />\nfilm noir genre for its atmosphere. This gives an arty,<br />\nsmall budget feel to it, although<br />\nit is a decidedly big money, big<br />\ncast production.<br />\nThe plot is juicy: a woman<br />\nwhose identity no one is sure of<br />\n(Theresa Russell) is marrying<br />\nwealthy men, murdering them,<br />\nand inheriting their money. First,<br />\nas a Chicago socialite, she<br />\npoisons her publishing magnate<br />\nhusband. She leaves New York<br />\nfor Dallas, where she poses as a<br />\nCharleston belle and marries a<br />\ntoy tycoon. She slips from New<br />\n<br />\nYork chic to Southern hospitality as easily as she slips the<br />\nodorless poison into her husband's brandy.<br />\nEnter Alex Barnes (Debra<br />\nWinger), a data analyst for the<br />\nJustice Department. Alex notices<br />\na connection between these<br />\nwealthy men who all pass away<br />\nshortly after marrying. This intrigues her, and she spends her<br />\nfree time trying to track down the<br />\nmurderess. She has a lot of free<br />\ntime, as she oddly avoids dating<br />\nmen. Alex and \"the widow\" are<br />\na study in opposites: one scruffy,<br />\nneurotic, building a life void of<br />\nmen;<br />\nthe<br />\nother<br />\ncool,<br />\nsophisticated, building her life<br />\naround men.<br />\nRonald Bass's screenplay picks<br />\nup as we are let in to see Russell<br />\nprepare for her next victim. She<br />\nchooses Edwin McCory (Nicol<br />\nWilliamson), millionaire coin<br />\ncollector. Russell studies ancient<br />\ncoins and appears at McCory's \u2022<br />\nmuseum as a charming New<br />\nEnglander. She makes a huge<br />\ndonation, gets on the board of<br />\ndirectors, and begins to flirt with<br />\nMcCory. Her technique is<br />\nfascinating, as Russell uses makeup, hair dye, and acting to assume<br />\nwhole new identities and change<br />\nages.<br />\nAnd she doesn't pick easy<br />\nprey, dumb pansies who live in<br />\nthe world of the gullible. McCory<br />\nnotes her interest in coins and<br />\nsays, \"I bet you looked those up<br />\njust to impress me.\" Edwin<br />\nchecks her credentials and finds<br />\nthat, yes, she is the dream girl<br />\nfrom Mount Holyoke College he<br />\nwas meant to marry.<br />\n<br />\nMurder Wealthy Husbands,<br />\nEntrance Pursuing Cop<br />\nMeanwhil, Winger realizes<br />\nwho the killer is and goes to prove<br />\nit to herself. She lets Russell<br />\nknow that she is snooping around<br />\nand that she is staying at the<br />\nHilton, and Russell goes there.<br />\nThere she is told that Winger<br />\ntransferred to another hotel, but<br />\nstalwart Debra is just hiding<br />\nacross the street from the second<br />\nhotel, waiting to see if Russell<br />\nwill follow that far. Russell does,<br />\nand Winger has the proof to continue the chase. In a fantastic moment, Russell realizes she's been<br />\nduped and has a conniption fit in<br />\nher car.<br />\nParanoid, Russell makes quick<br />\nwork of McCory and leaves for<br />\nHawaii. Against the advice of her<br />\nboss (Dennis Hopper), Barnes<br />\nquits her dull job and pursues. In<br />\nHawaii the film opens up, and the<br />\nscenery opens up as well, turning<br />\nfrom boardrooms and bedrooms<br />\nto volcanoes and rivers. Lush<br />\ngreens and deep blues provide an<br />\nalluring backdrop as the pace<br />\nquickens. Russell has set her<br />\nsights on Paul (Sami Frey), a<br />\nhotel developer. Under an assumed name, Barnes joins a scuba<br />\nclass and befriends Russell. From<br />\nthere on, it is a stylish match of<br />\nwits.<br />\nThis is an odd, teasing movie.<br />\nThe scenery teases as it<br />\ncharms\u2014Rafelson's<br />\nselfconscious direction teases with its<br />\nimages\u2014and the actresses tease<br />\ntheir men and each other. As<br />\nWinger becomes more like<br />\nRussell, their relationship gains\u2022<br />\nan uneasy sexual tension. Winger<br />\nand Russell flirt with each other.<br />\nAt one point in which Winger is<br />\ngiving Russell mouth-to-mouth,-<br />\n<br />\nshe says, \"I hope you don't take<br />\nthis personally.\" The film is<br />\nchock full of good lines like that,<br />\nas when Russell boldly announces<br />\nto a sleazy private-eye, \"Let me<br />\ntell you two things about myself.<br />\nI'm rich . . . and I'm wealthy.\"<br />\nSami Frey is sexy enough as<br />\nPaul, but Williamson and Hopper<br />\nare wasted in their roles as colorless, \"nice\" guys. One can't<br />\nhelp but imagine that Hitchcock<br />\nwould have turned the men into<br />\neccentrics, but Rafelson gives the<br />\nmovie totally to Russell and<br />\nWinger. Debra Winger plays the<br />\nsame scruffy, bookish role she<br />\ntook in Legal Eagles, only she<br />\ntrades the humor for obsession.<br />\nBetween that movie and this one,<br />\nshe seems to be constructing<br />\nsome sort of unattractive \"image\" which undermines the sexy<br />\ncharisma that made her stand out<br />\nin An Officer and a Gentleman.<br />\nWhile she won't win any<br />\nOscars as long as there are<br />\npitiable farm girls the Academy<br />\ncan idealize, Theresa Russell<br />\nturns in one of the best performances of 1987. There is some<br />\ninternal rage, pity and love which<br />\nfuels this dynamo of evil. Russell<br />\nis, at the same time, stunningly<br />\nelegant and seductive. Rafelson<br />\nhas toned down her \"admissions\" to Winger, and keeps the<br />\naudience guessing at her true<br />\nmotives. In a move that most noir<br />\nwould shun, he keeps the audience guessing even after the<br />\nmovie's over. It works, and the<br />\nfilm emerges as a well-made<br />\ncharacter study, tense and full of<br />\ntwists. If you like a juicy thriller,<br />\nyou'll fall for the Black Widow.<br />\n<br />\nTheresa Russell (above right) and Debra Winger star in 'Black Widow.'<br />\n<br />\n\f22/FEBRUARY 20, 1987<br />\n<br />\nScience<br />\nHopkins Psychologist Here<br />\nAt Homewood Wins Young Investigator Award<br />\nget older. Attitude formation<br />\nseems especially important in the<br />\nyoung, so-called formative, years<br />\nwhere many influences sway our<br />\nattitudes. After the initial formation of an attitude, they can be<br />\neither reinforced by positive influences as we get older and form<br />\ndeeply ingrained long-lasting attitudes or they can be dissipated<br />\nby the arrival of new influences.<br />\nIt is not so easy to change a person's attitudes even if the person<br />\nhimself wishes to change them.<br />\nLots of attitudes have certain<br />\n\"non-volitional aspects\" attached to them that are very hard to<br />\nbe undone. These aspects include<br />\nphysical addiction to an activity<br />\n<br />\nchanged by repetition of a certain<br />\nstimulus. \"Repetition of<br />\nsomething tends to make people<br />\nmore fond of it and hence changes<br />\na person's attitudes and<br />\nbehavior,\" says Dr. Breckler. He<br />\ncited this as the reason behind<br />\ntelevision and radio advertisements. The constant repetition<br />\nof jingles and images tends to<br />\nmake the viewer or listener look<br />\nmore favorably on a product and<br />\ntherefore influences his purchasing behavior. Repetition of a certain image or message works<br />\neven on those people who are initially opposed to the meaning or<br />\nideas behind them. In that way,<br />\nadvertisers and propagandists can<br />\n<br />\nPortrait<br />\nof a Hopkins Scientist<br />\n<br />\nDr. Stephen Breckler, assistant professor of psychology, relaxes during<br />\nby Joseph M.

He will instead spend the time out \"in the<br />\nfield\", gathering data, then piecing it together and pulling it apart<br />\nat his computer, and finally coming up with an answer or explanation to his research problem. As<br />\na social psychologist, his research<br />\nproblems are people problems, a<br />\nsearch for why people have the<br />\nattitudes they do, how they were<br />\nformed and what can be done<br />\nabout them. The information<br />\ngarnered from his research may<br />\nbe used by organizations to<br />\nunderstand the way people act<br />\nand react, by leaders and<br />\nmanagers to know better how to<br />\nmobilize people, and by society<br />\nin general to understand the inner<br />\nworkings of human beings.<br />\nDr. Breckler received his<br />\nundergraduate degree from the<br />\nUniversity of California, San<br />\nDiego and went on to complete<br />\nhis graduate studies at Ohio State.<br />\nAfter performing his postdoctoral<br />\nwork at Northwestern University, Dr. Breckler came to Hopkins<br />\nin 1984 as an assistant professor.<br />\nStill fresh from student life, Dr.<br />\nBreckler stands out amongst his<br />\ncolleagues as one of the younger<br />\nmembers of the faculty. Although<br />\nnew to the field of academia,<br />\nBreckler seems to have made the<br />\ntransition well, teaching and<br />\nspending his time researching<br />\na variety of topics in his field.<br />\nThe National Science Foundation chose to recognize Breckler's<br />\nresearching skills recently by<br />\nnaming him as a winner of one of<br />\nits prestigious Presidential Young<br />\nInvestigator Awards. Breckler<br />\nwas one of two researchers affiliated with Hopkins to receive<br />\nthe award which honors scientists<br />\nand engineers who have receiv-<br />\n<br />\ned their PhD's in the last five<br />\nyears. The award includes a grant<br />\nto further the research goals of its<br />\nrecipient.<br />\nBreckler's current research<br />\ndeals with the topic of blood ,<br />\ndonors and their attitudes to giving blood. Besides the fact that<br />\nthere is a constant short supply of<br />\nblood available for medical use,<br />\nwhich presents a psychological<br />\nproblem in itself, an especially<br />\ntroublesome and not so well<br />\nstudied problem is the fact that a<br />\nvery small percentage of firsttime donors ever make a second<br />\ndonation. The reasons for this<br />\nphenomenon are baffling the Red<br />\nCross and Dr. Breckler feels that<br />\nit is a pressing enough concern<br />\nthat needs to be addressed.<br />\nPsychologists have not been<br />\nable to explain the phenomena so<br />\nfar. \"Understandably,\" began<br />\nBreckler, \"people are afraid of<br />\ngiving blood, they are afraid of<br />\nthe pain, and they don't like the<br />\nassociation they make with blood<br />\ndonating and sick people. People<br />\nwill make up all sorts of excuses<br />\nto avoid giving blood, such as<br />\ncontracting AIDS, even though<br />\nthose fears are unfounded.\"<br />\nAfter donating blood, however,<br />\npeople experience a major shift in<br />\ntheir attitudes. \"Most people feel<br />\nvery happy after giving blood,\"<br />\ncontinued Dr. Breckler, \"They<br />\nfeel like they've done something<br />\ngood and worthwhile for society<br />\nand nearly all of them say they<br />\nwould do it again. The sad truth<br />\nis that most of those people will<br />\nnot return.\" According to Dr.<br />\nBreckler, current thought is that<br />\npresumably all the fears that had<br />\nto be overcome before making the<br />\nfirst donation have been allayed<br />\nafter the experience of giving<br />\n\u2022blood. Since most people<br />\nresponded that the experience<br />\nwas a positive one and that the<br />\ncause a worthy one, they should<br />\nbe expected to come back. Such<br />\nis \"unfortunately not the case.\"<br />\nDr. Breckler is at the start of<br />\na long project to be conducted<br />\nwith persons who have not<br />\n<br />\nsuch as cigarette smoking where<br />\nphysiological as well as<br />\npsychological treatment is<br />\na break at his Rotunda Office<br />\nnecessary to stop a person from<br />\nsmoking.

The foil team's season<br />\nrecord now stands at a very im- .<br />\npressive 15-3. This weekend's<br />\nmeets at Newark are the last<br />\nbefore the MAC's. This will be<br />\nthe team's last chance to sharpen<br />\ntheir skills before the fight for the<br />\n<br />\ntitle. Judging from the foil team's<br />\npast record this year, they stand<br />\na chance of winning their weapon<br />\nat the MAC's.<br />\nAs the year draws to a close,<br />\nthoughts turn towards next year<br />\nwhen the foil team will release its<br />\nsecret weapon: Mike Greenfield<br />\nwho has been red-shirted for the<br />\nyear in order to undergo an intensive training program. Coach<br />\nOles has said, \"I feel confident<br />\nthat when I turn him loose next<br />\nyear, he will dominate foil<br />\nfencing\u2014at least at the beginner<br />\nlevel.<br />\nThe epee team struggled<br />\nthrough another rough day last<br />\nSaturday, dropping all three matches it fenced. While the three<br />\nweapon team as a whole was<br />\ntrouncing its first two opponents<br />\nof the day, VMI and VP!, epee<br />\nlost their matches against both<br />\nthese teams by 4-5 margins.<br />\nAgainst VMI, sophomores Herb<br />\nTomaso and Andy Chen both<br />\nposted (1-1) records, while senior<br />\nJeff Poehler checked in at 2-1.<br />\nEpee team captain Dave Lumby<br />\nlost a close bout, as'did<br />\nsophomore Mike Runge. VMI's<br />\ntowering first man escaped<br />\nwithout a loss to the Jays. Against<br />\na surprisingly strong VP! epee<br />\n. squad, Chen and Tomaso were<br />\n0-2 and 2-0 respectively, while<br />\nPoehler was again 2-1. Both<br />\nRunge and Lumby again lost their<br />\nbouts by close margins. VPI's<br />\nepee team looks a bit stronger<br />\nthan it has in recent years.<br />\nThe prowess of the opposition<br />\ntook a giant bound upward with<br />\nthe third match of the day, but the<br />\nbegan with an 8-1 victory over<br />\neemen lost by was deceptive.<br />\nWhile Herb Tomaso pulled out<br />\nthe Jay's only epee victory,<br />\n<br />\nArthur Fonzarelli<br />\n<br />\nHappy days continued for the Fencers as they made VMI and VPI sit<br />\non it in last weekend's action at Arnold's Athletic Center.<br />\n<br />\nTomaso, Chen and Poehler lost<br />\nsome very close bouts. The epee<br />\nteam lost a staggering six bouts<br />\nby 5-4 scores. Vassar's epeemen, including one three-year<br />\nstarter and one two-year starter,<br />\nsimply had the edge in experience<br />\nto help them win the close bouts,<br />\nas well as fencing in a frustrating,<br />\ndefensive style.<br />\nOn the day, Tomasso was<br />\n(4-3), Poehler (4-5) and Chen<br />\n(1-6) while Lumby and Runge<br />\nwere a combined (0-4). Tomasso<br />\ncontinues to lead the epee squad<br />\nwith a season record of(25-18),<br />\nfollowed by Poehler at (24-23)<br />\nand Chen at (21-21). Against the<br />\nMAC teams only, Tomasso leads<br />\nalso with a mark of(19-8), while<br />\nPoehler is (15-4) and Chen<br />\n(7-18). Look for the fast-learning<br />\nepeemen to improve their showing against the tough teams in the<br />\nupcoming MAC postseason tournament, where they will get<br />\nanother shot ay such teams as<br />\nLafayette, William & Mary and<br />\n<br />\nVassar, as well as numerous<br />\nlesser opponents.<br />\nDespite the disappointing<br />\ndefeat to Vassar, the sabre team<br />\nhad an impressive day, which<br />\nPegaki with a 8-1 victory over<br />\nVMI. Senior captain Steve Forman went 2-1, while Tom Cantilina and Mark Dresnin went<br />\nundefeated at 2-0 each. Andy<br />\nJablonowski and Alvin Egerer<br />\nfinished winning a bout each.<br />\nCoach Oles cleverly changed the<br />\nline up for the following meet<br />\nagainst VP!. For this meet, the<br />\nsecond string started with Dave<br />\nHowe finishing 2-0, while<br />\nJablonowski and Egerer finished<br />\n2-1 and 1-1, respectively. The second string was then thrown in to<br />\nbring the sabre team to a 6-3 victory. The most challenging meet<br />\nwas last; nevertheless Forman<br />\nwas strong, winning 2-1, bringing his overall record to 27- 14;<br />\nCatilina dominated with a 3-0 victory (being undefeated for the<br />\nday) bringing his record to 26-15;<br />\n<br />\nand Drasnin finished 2-1, bringing his overall to 30-12. Although<br />\nVassar won the meet with an extremely close 14-13, the Jay's<br />\nsabre team destroyed with a 7-2<br />\nvictory.<br />\nThe Jays' record now stands at<br />\n15-4 with three meets left before<br />\nthe conference championships.<br />\n\"We've fenced every other team<br />\nin the conference and it looks as<br />\nif the two roadblocks standing in<br />\nthe way of a fourth consecutive<br />\ntitle are William and Mary and<br />\nVassar,\" commented Coach Dick<br />\nOles. \"They were our only two<br />\nconference losses and both times<br />\nour intensity level ws not where<br />\nit should have been.

At<br />\nHopkins, there's a much more reliable way<br />\nto mark the passage of winter. Just wait for<br />\nthe late-February announcement of next<br />\nyear's tuition increase. It comes like<br />\nclockwork.<br />\nIn a Student Council meeting (which has<br />\nnow become an annual ritual more temporally precise than the Gilman chimes),<br />\nUniversity President Steven Muller, flocked by an entourage of deans, a vicepresident, and administrative heavyweights, announced an $800 tuition hike for<br />\nnext year. The increase will bring<br />\nundergraduate tuition at Hopkins up to a<br />\ncool $11,000 for the next academic year.<br />\nOf course, the increase comes as no surprise to anyone who has been at Hopkins<br />\nfor any length of time. Last year, tuition<br />\nshot up $800 as it did the year before that.<br />\nIn fact, tuition has increased at a rate of six<br />\npercent or more, per year, for the last thirteen years, and according to University officials, there's no reason to hope that that<br />\ntrend will change very much in the immediate future.<br />\nSo, all things considered, the size and<br />\ntiming of the hike seemed to be quite<br />\npredictable.<br />\nWhat was equally predictable was the<br />\nAdministration's defense of the increase.<br />\nAs usual, Muller came to the Council<br />\nmeeting armed with a list of the tuition<br />\ncharged at 106 other colleges and universities. He was happy to point out that<br />\nHopkins was about fiftieth on the list, all<br />\ncosts considered.<br />\nMuller's list is always interesting and hits<br />\na soft spot in most students. (Almost<br />\neveryone at Hopkins revels in comparisons<br />\nof universities a la Barron's Guide.)<br />\nBut such lists hardly provide a justification for tuition increases. We believe<br />\nthere's no reason to compare Hopkins with<br />\nother schools when tuition decisions are<br />\nmade. Hopkins ought to assess its own<br />\nfinancial needs and resources, make its<br />\ndecision, and justify it regardless of the<br /><br />\nprices charged elsewhere. After all, comparing tuition rates among universities<br />\nwith the purpose of justifying one's own<br />\ntuition is a little like justifying tax increases<br />\nby quoting the tax rates paid in other countries. It doesn't mean very much.<br />\nIn fact, there probably are good reasons<br />\nfor increasing tuition. But those reasons<br />\nbarely surfaced at the Council meeting.<br />\nDespite the similarities in Muller's<br />\npresentation of the tuition increase this year<br />\nto those of years past, there was one striking difference. Wednesday's meeting was<br />\nthe first meeting in three years at which<br />\nMuller broke the news of the size of the<br />\nincrease to Council. We commend him for<br />\ndoing so.<br />\nLast year, we asked Muller about a possible tuition increase, and he released the size<br />\nof the hike to us weeks before he appeared<br />\nat Council. And in 1985, Muller tipped off<br />\nJon Lana, then Student Council president,<br />\nin advance.<br />\nThis year, Muller apparently decided to<br />\nreturn to the tradition of breaking the news<br />\nat a Council meeting itself.<br />\nOf course, we appreciate getting scoops<br />\nlike the tuition increase last year and won't<br />\ncomplain if it happens again. But, the Student Council is the elected representative<br />\norganization of the undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins, and should therefore be the first<br />\nto be formally informed of decisions like<br />\nan $800 tuition increase. Clearly, notifying Council is the most diplomatic way to<br />\nrelease the news of an increase.<br />\nAs the initial din caused by the announcement of the tuition increase subsides, the<br />\nhike will likely be soon forgotten. Nevertheless, the Administration owes the<br />\nstudents who will foot the bill a more complete account of the reasons for the increase. Specifically, a report detailing the<br />\nrising expenses of operating the University should be presented to Council.<br />\nOnly then will students be able to make<br />\nsome reasonable conclusions about the<br />\nnecessity of a tuition increase.<br /><br />\nSnaring a Speaker<br />\nThe issue of commencement speakers is<br />\nalways a touchy one. No matter how<br />\nfamous or infamous a given speaker may<br />\nbe, there are sure to be those among the<br />\nSenior Class who will complain. This year,<br />\nhowever, we suspect that the complainers<br />\nwill be fewer and farther between than in<br />\nrecent years, thanks in large measure to the<br />\nwork of the Graduation Speaker<br />\nCommittee.<br />\nAfter nearly four months of hard work,<br />\nthe committee managed to snare sportswriter and announcer Howard Cosell for<br />\nthe afternoon convocation ceremony. All<br />\nthe members of the Senior Class should be<br />\npleased.<br />\nIn recent years, the \"prestige\" of the<br />\nSenior Class speakers has vacillated<br />\ndramatically. In '84, William F. Buckley,<br />\nJr. graced the ceremony; in '85, actor John<br />\nHouseman took the podium; and in '86,<br />\noceanographer Roger Revelle gave the<br />\nsenior address. While all three speakers<br />\nperformed well, Senior Class morale seemed to be particularly high at the speech of<br />\nthe most famous of the three.<br /><br />\nThis year, the ceremony seems destined<br />\nfor the same success as Graduation '84.<br />\nCommencement will feature a \"brandname\" Senior Class speaker with wide appeal; and a morning speaker, Vartan<br />\nGregorian, the president of the New York<br />\nPublic Library, who will likely provide an<br />\ninteresting speech as well.<br />\nConsidering the fiscal restraints imposed on the Graduation Speaker Committee,<br />\nattracting a speaker of Cosell's fame must<br />\nhave been no easy endeavor. In an age<br />\nwhen a well-known speaker can clear a<br />\nfive-digit salary for a one-hour lecture, the<br />\n$2,500 honorarium offered by the senior<br />\nclass could hardly serve as bait for most<br />\nspeakers. Without considerable generosity on the part of the speaker and diplomacy<br />\non the part of the Graduation Speaker Committee, it would be impossible to imagine<br />\nattracting a lecturer of Cosell's stature.<br />\nThis year, we look forward to an interesting commencement ceremony and<br />\ncommend the Graduation Speaker Committee for tackling a difficult job and<br />\nprevailing.<br /><br />\nAs President of the Student<br />\nCouncil, I thought it might be<br />\nhelpful to clear the air and give<br />\nyou an idea ofjust what is going<br />\non with your Student Council and<br />\ncampus.<br />\nTo assuage any fears about the<br />\nHOP's ability to book rooms, I<br />\nhave personally investigated the<br />\nsituation and been assured that<br />\nthere has been no oversight by the<br />\nHOP or the Social Committee<br />\nwith regard to social program-<br /><br />\nI suggest we explore the upgraded system to its fullest extent<br />\nbefore demanding further<br />\nmodification.<br />\nWith regard to communication<br />\nand freedoms of expression, I applaud the News-Letter's coverage<br />\nof the report of the Committee on<br />\nFreedom of Expression. For that<br />\nmatter, the News-Letter has,<br />\noverall, done one of the best jobs<br />\nI've seen in the last four years.<br />\nHowever, nothing is without<br /><br />\nmark komisky<br />\ning this semester.<br />\nThe SAC Seals committee is<br />\ndue to report in the coming<br />\nweeks. While many would like to<br />\neliminate the Seals altogether,<br />\nothers still feel it is appropriate<br />\nto recognize those seniors with<br />\noutstanding contributions to student activities on this campus.<br />\nI'm afraid both I, personally, and<br />\nthe Council seem torn over the<br />\nissue and eagerly await the committee's report.<br />\nSecurity has greatly improved<br />\nat Homewood in recent years.<br />\nWith the additions in lighting,<br />\nsecurity phones, and additional<br />\nmonitors on the quads and in the<br />\ndorms it should have been obvious that the next expansion<br />\nmust be to obtain another shuttle.<br />\nUnfortunately, the issue was<br />\nsimply never raised before. With<br />\nthe addition of another van,<br />\nhopefully the system will accommodate students' needs. While<br />\nI empathize and for the most part<br />\nagree that the University should<br />\ntake a greater interest in and<br />\nresponsibility for its students, I do<br />\nnot think a JHU taxi service in<br />\nand around Homewood is possible, logistically or economically.<br /><br />\nfaults (including Hopkins<br />\nstudents) but those that do their<br />\nbest deserve some credit.

Wu<br />\nThe desire to take an afternoon<br />\nnap is a sign of maturity, as<br />\nchildren, with their lack of<br />\nforesight, fight until exhaustion to<br />\navoid the pleasure, and adults, if<br />\nthey think for a moment, realize<br />\nthat while anybody can do lunch,<br />\nonly the mighty may then sleep.<br />\nFor the past several years, I have<br />\npursued the perfect nap, and am<br />\ncloser to momentary bliss than<br />\nwhen I first started.<br />\nSleeping in class is worse than<br />\nnot sleeping. Not only is it rude,<br />\nbut it rarely gets past a few jerks<br />\nof the head without leading to<br />\nsnoring, drooling, falling out of<br />\nthe chair, or some other atrocity.<br />\nFor their foolishness, people<br />\nsleeping in class deserve to be<br />\nwhacked on the head, or at least<br />\nnoticed and made fun of. The real<br />\npower nap must take place in a<br />\ncomfortable environment. More<br />\nimportantly, it must take place in<br />\nprivate.<br />\nThe length of the nap would<br />\nseem to be the most important<br />\nvariable, but if it is to be a nap<br />\nat all it should not exceed half an<br />\nhour, or forty-five minutes at<br />\nmost. Anything longer is probably the result of exhaustion and<br />\nwhen I wake from a three or four<br />\nhour slumber, the entire day or<br />\nnight is ruined, as well as my<br />\nsleep schedule for the rest of the<br />\nweek. After all, the purpose of a<br />\nnap is to relax and then perhaps<br />\nreturn to work, not to collapse<br />\nand struggle back to a sleepinduced stupor.<br />\nSetting the alarm clock is easy<br />\nenough. Setting the thermostat is<br />\nnot at all easy. If the room is<br />\nwarm I will feel more tired and<br />\ntake longer to fall asleep than if<br />\nthe room is cool. After falling<br />\nasleep I will probably have a<br />\nnightmare, wake up, feel<br />\nmiserable and still tired, and fall<br />\nasleep again for another<br />\nnightmare, usually about<br />\nneglected work. Only if the room<br />\nis just cool enough are naps<br />\nrefreshing.<br />\nOf course, waking is the biggest problem. Waking poorly can<br />\nmake the entire experience a<br />\nwaste of time. If the timing is off,<br />\nwaking can leave a person too<br />\nhyped-up to go back to whatever<br /><br />\nthey were doing. This seems to<br />\nhappen when the nap is too short:<br />\nit is just enough to give a person<br />\na jolt of random energy, and this<br />\nwill throw them off and give them<br />\ninsomnia later. If the nap is too<br />\nlong, or the waking process is<br />\ndrawn out, the nap will turn out<br />\nto be completely useless, a draining of energy, leaving the napper<br />\nmore tired than when he started.<br />\nThe perfect nap comes down to<br />\na few minor details and perfect<br />\nawakening. This should come just<br />\nbefore the alarm clock is about to<br />\nstart up, to give the illusion of<br />\nfreedom (\"I can sleep as long as<br />\nI want\"), and it should take only<br />\na second to snap to a fully functional state. When carried off in<br />\nthis form, the nap will sometimes<br />\ninclude a special bonus, an idea<br />\nfor a story, the solution to a puzzle, or the sudden desire to do<br />\nsomething.

For the<br />\nundergraduate population at<br />\nHopkins, those figures work out<br />\nto 200 gays and possibly 500<br />\nbisexuals.<br />\nGALA\u2014the Gay and Lesbian<br />\nAlliance\u2014is the response of conscientious and concerned people<br />\nto this situation. The group's purpose, according to president<br />\nJoshua Stuart is twofold. First,<br />\nthey provide support for gays<br />\nwho are coming out\u2014not actually making public, but rather ceasing to hide their sexuality. This<br />\ntransition may be extremely difficult emotionally and many gays<br />\nare unable to make it on their<br />\nown. \"Their self-esteem has been<br />\nso beaten down that they can't get<br />\nup the courage to meet other people who can help them,\" says<br />\nStuart. He emphasizes \"the need<br />\nto reach out and let people know<br />\nthat other gay people exist.\" The<br />\nprocess of coming out is further<br /><br />\ncomplicated by social pressures;<br />\n\"It's not uncommon for parents<br />\nto beat their (gay) children,<br />\nspecifically for fathers to beat<br />\ntheir gay daughters.\" And what<br />\nabout the job environment? \"People get fired every day (for being<br />\ngay),\" says Stuart. \"It's sad, but<br />\nit happens. All the time.\"<br />\nGALA's other main function is<br />\nthe education of the straight community about gays and the gay<br />\ncommunity. \"I think that educa-<br /><br />\ntion is the key to understanding<br />\nand acceptance,\" says Stuart, and<br />\nhe stresses the fact that the issue<br />\nmust be humanized for the educational approach to be successful.<br />\n\"The biggest problem is that it is<br />\ndifficult to humanize an un-<br /><br />\nfamiliar issue in a coherent, rational way.\" He gives an example: \"All kinds of people who<br />\nhave real problems with gays are<br />\nchanged completely when they<br />\nrealize that their brother or their<br />\nbest friend, or maybe a parent, is<br />\ngay. Then the problem is<br />\nhumanized, then they can see<br />\nhow stupid their bias is.\" Of<br />\ncourse not everyone will have this<br />\nsort of contact, so the problem<br />\nremains.<br />\nThe Alliance has been well<br />\nsupported by the administration in<br />\nboth of these purposes. \"The administration has been great, to the<br />\nextent that the administration as<br />\nfar as we deal with it is Mary<br />\nEllen Porter and Andrea Perry,\"<br />\nsays Stuart. This year, a<br />\nrepresentative for the Alliance<br />\nmet with all of the Housemasters<br />\nin order to educate them on the<br />\nspecial problems of gay<br />\nfreshmen. \"Statistically, there<br />\nare between 60 and 70 gays in the<br />\nfreshman dorms, and the<br />\nHousemasters need to know how<br />\nto help them, and where to send<br />\nthem for help they're not<br />\nqualified to give.\" In that func-<br /><br />\ntion, the support service for gays,<br />\n\"the White House has been very<br />\ngood in regards to their sensitivity<br />\nto the gay community,\" says<br />\nStuart.<br />\nThe Alliance has meetings,<br />\nopen to the public, on the first<br />\nTuesday of every month at 5:00<br />\np.m. in the basement of Levering.<br />\nThe meetings serve primarily a<br />\nbusiness function. Additionally,<br />\nthere is a \"rap group\" which<br />\nmeets in Conference Room A \"to<br /><br />\ngive gay students a chance to<br />\nmeet other people as well as a<br />\nchance to talk about gay<br />\nconcerns.\"<br />\nWhen asked about the main<br />\ntopics of discussion, and<br />\nspecifically whether AIDS is<br /><br />\ndiscussed at the rap sessions,<br />\nStuart responds, \"On a few occasions, yes. Primarily the<br />\ndiscussion is about our own personal fears [concerning the<br />\ndisease]. It's important that we<br />\nlearn to go on living, that we not<br />\nstop our lives out of fear.\" He<br />\nadds, \"It is a mistake to think of<br />\nAIDS as a gay disease merely<br />\nbecause it started in the gay commUnity. AIDS is not selective.<br />\nFor the time being it is primarily<br />\na concern of the gay community<br />\nbecause that's where it's most<br />\nprominent. That's changing<br />\nquickly, though, as the disease<br />\nspreads. You can pick up a<br />\nNewsweek and you'll find an ad<br />\nfor condoms, and it will talk<br />\nabout how AIDS is not a gay<br />\ndisease.\"<br />\nAsked if there was anything<br />\nelse the public should be more<br />\naware of, Stuart responds, \"Yes.<br />\nThe difference between the word<br />\ngay and the term homosexual.<br />\nHomosexual is a very clinical<br />\nword, and as a label, it is applied<br />\nto us by others. We call ourselves<br />\ngay, not homosexual.\"<br /><br />\nDebate Continues<br />\nParlous Precedent<br />\nby Howard Zachary Robbins<br />\nA popular vision of Hell is that<br />\nof constant discord and argument.<br />\nTo a Hopkins debater, Heaven<br />\ncould not be better described.<br />\n1987 marks the sixth year of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Parliamentary<br />\nDebate Council, but debate at<br />\nHopkins enjoys a far lengthier<br />\nhistory than that. Woodrow<br />\nWilson, when he was a graduate<br />\nstudent at Hopkins, felt the need<br />\nfor a forum to debate current<br />\nissues on campus. From that<br />\norganization, The House of Commons [featured elsewhere on<br />\nthese pages], was spawned a<br />\ndebate team that competed on an<br />\ninter-collegiate level. Until 1982<br />\nit was on-topic debate, with<br />\nresearched topics, that Hopkins<br />\ndebaters pursued at Homewood.<br />\nInterest in this factual debate<br />\nflagged, though, so the<br />\nparliamentary form of debate<br />\npopular in Canada and Great Britain was introduced to Hopkins<br />\nstudents still determined to spend<br />\ntheir time arguing.<br />\nIf debate brings to mind stern<br />\narguments over nuclear war and<br />\nabortion, then \"parliamentary<br />\ndebate\" would seem a foreign<br />\nterm. A resolution, usually a line<br />\nfrom a poem, book, song, or even<br />\ngraffiti, is read to the team randomly assigned to present the<br />\ncase ten minutes before the case<br />\nmust be presented. What this<br />\nwhole process boils down to is<br />\nthat in ten brief minutes, the duo<br />\nmust come up with some<br />\ndebatable proposal for another<br />\ntwo-member team to oppose. The<br />\nresult, both teams hope, is a genuinely amusing yet convincing<br />\nargument to sway the judge(s)<br />\ntoward their point of view.<br /><br />\nA debater's ultimate goal is<br />\n\"hardware\"\u2014trophies, silver<br />\nplates and wooden gavels to cart<br />\nback from tournaments and hang<br />\non walls. To acquire these dandy<br />\nitems, debaters must prove to<br />\njudges in five rounds of debate<br />\nover two days that they have won<br />\nthe arguments, and have been<br />\nmore eloquent in the process.<br />\nThough the quantification of<br />\none's speaking ability is a difficult<br />\nendeavor, judges must do so on<br />\nthe scoring ballots. Speakers are<br />\nrated on a scale of one to thirty,<br />\nbut most scores range in the low<br />\n20's.<br />\nThe hope of hardware and the<br />\nthrill of inter-collegiate competition has increased the ranks of the<br /><br />\nactive members today. The dreams<br />\nof trophies have certainly not<br />\ngone unrealized. The Fall of '86<br />\nbrought fifteen trophies to<br />\nHomewood from tournaments at<br />\nUMBC, Penn and Columbia.<br />\nHopkins debaters also competed<br />\nat Brown, Vassar and Harvard.<br />\n1987 is off to an optimistic start,<br />\na Hopkins team having won fifth<br />\nplace at the Goucher debate tournament, the first of the semester.<br />\nAll trophies, however, are not<br />\ncreated equal. The greatest honor<br />\nfor any parliamentary debater is<br />\nto win at the World Debate Tournament, held in a different coun-<br /><br />\ntry every year. Since the 1984<br />\nseason, Hopkins has sent its<br />\nargumentative representatives as<br />\nfar away as Dublin, Ireland to<br />\nbattle Canadian, American,<br />\nEnglish, Irish, Scottish and<br />\nAustralian teams. Last year the<br />\nHopkins delegation won third<br />\nplace at World, better than any<br />\nother American team had done<br />\npreviously.<br />\nThe Debate Council's hopes<br />\nfor the future are stellar.<br />\nMembership is on a constant rise<br />\nand, assuming a sufficient rise in<br />\nfunding, these debaters can continue the Hopkins tradition of<br />\nhumor and victory up and down<br />\nthe East Coast and around the<br />\nglobe.<br />\nThe newly-elected President<br />\nof the Council, junior Chris<br />\nArzt, is seeking to expand the<br />\nsuccess of the team and funding<br />\nto match. A sale of fruit baskets<br />\nraised much-needed dollars for<br />\nthe Council, and other projects<br />\nare in the works. Arzt is joined<br />\nby sophomore Aneil Shirke as<br />\nVice President of Operations,<br />\nsophomore Charles Fitzgerald as<br />\nVice President of Development,<br />\nfreshman Howard Robbins as<br />\nTreasurer, and junior Eric Kane<br />\nas Secretary.<br />\nLooking forward toward<br />\nSpring, the Debate Council plans<br />\nto send teams to tournaments at<br />\nRandolph-Macon, Princeton,<br />\nNYU, Yale and Wesleyan, with<br />\nother tournaments still in question. Hopkins debate forges ahead<br />\nwith the hope of solving problems<br />\nfrom behind a podium, not a gun.<br />\nHumor, wit and eloquence reign<br />\nsupreme, and Hopkins is always<br />\nreaching for the front of the pack.<br /><br />\nWilson's Club<br />\nfounded a House of Commons at<br />\nevery institution he was conBack in 1884 when Woodrow nected with and for a while, the<br />\nWilson was a political science idea of a model House of Comgraduate student at Johns mons flourished and was<br />\nHopkins, he founded the Hopkins duplicated at colleges across the<br />\nHouse of Commons.

The<br />\nadministrative details were<br />\ndiscussed and dispensed with.<br />\nThen the arbitrator hammered his<br />\ngavel and the fun began. What<br />\nfollowed was a lively discussion<br />\non the utility of limits on jury<br />\nawards. The members quickly<br />\nfactioned into very opinionated<br />\ngroups. There was mad notetaking, frequent outbursts and<br />\ncrashes of the gavel. The debate<br />\nwas filled with amusing anecdotes<br />\n(a person shaving his head with<br />\na lawnmower) and barely veiled<br />\nstatements masquerading as questions. All the arguments<br />\nculminated in a vote which was<br />\nsomething of an anti-climax to the<br />\nheated debate. Then, the<br /><br />\nmembers decided on who would<br />\nwrite resolutions for the next<br />\nweek, and everyone filed out.<br />\nOne cabinet member assured<br />\nme that one need not know<br />\nParliamentary procedure to participate.

As she was<br />\nreplacing a book onto a shelf, she<br />\nturned around and stumbled over<br />\na box.<br />\nCuriosity may have been Pandora's enemy but it did not stop<br />\nRodgers from looking into the<br />\nbox; and upon inspection, she<br />\ndiscovered over 750 unpublished<br />\nlove letters, dated between 1923<br />\nand 1935, written by Mencken<br />\nand Haardt. After Haardt's death,<br />\nMencken gave the letters to<br />\nGoucher under a 45-year restriction, a restriction that expired the<br />\nyear of Rodger's discovery.<br />\nThe discovery of the letters was<br />\njust the first step in Rodgers'<br />\nwork. After graduating from<br />\nGoucher, she received a<br />\nfellowship to do graduate work at<br />\nEmory University in Atlanta. It<br />\nwas there that she turned the love<br />\nletters into a Masters Thesis investigating the literary relationship between Mencken and<br />\nHaardt, and the role that Mencken played in instigating the<br />\nSouthern Literary Renaissance.<br />\nFor Rodgers, the ball kept rolling, and soon she was presenting<br />\nto publishers the idea of compiling the letters into a book about<br />\nMencken and Haardt.<br />\nThe entire project, including<br />\ngraduate work, took four years to<br />\ncomplete, and according to<br />\nRodgers, \"no stone was left un-<br /><br />\nturned.\" She interviewed people<br />\nwho knew Mencken and Haardt,<br />\nread books about the people they<br />\nknew, visited places such as<br />\nMontgomery, Alabama (Haardt's<br />\nhometown), and even ate at Mencken and Haardt's favorite<br />\nrestaurant, Marconi's.<br />\n\"There was a year of really<br />\nsolid research,\" Rodgers says. \"I<br />\nreally immersed myself in the<br />\nsubject.

Among its graduates<br />\nare Russell Baker, John Barth, Louis Rubin,<br />\nMary Robison and Louise Erdrich. Here are<br />\nseveral perspectives on the work of the<br />\ndepartment, including an exclusive piece by<br />\nBaker describing the founding of the<br />\nseminars by Elliott Coleman in 1946<br />\n(reprintedfrom the Writing Seminars history<br />\ncompiled by Bob Arellano, with permission<br />\nof the author).<br />\nJohn Irwin, chairman of the department<br />\nsince 1977, talks about the philosophy of<br />\nteaching writing.<br />\nWhat we mean when we talk about a<br />\nworkshop is not that kind of backslapping<br />\nagreement between people sitting around a<br />\ntable saying, \"If you like my stuff, I like your<br />\nstuff.\"<br />\nWe think of them as being a group in<br />\nwhich an older, more experienced writer sits<br />\ndown with apprentice writers and, giving<br />\nthem the benefit of his or her experience, tries<br />\nto save them a certain amount of time and<br />\nerror in progressing in their own work. And<br />\nwhen we see somebody who we think is very<br /><br />\ngood, as when Mary Robison was here, John<br />\nBarth put her in touch with his agent. She had<br />\na couple of stories taken by New Yorker in<br />\nthe spring of her year here. There is, I think,<br />\noften a danger of in-breeding in writing programs. It's not any more of a danger in<br />\nwriting than in other fields.<br />\nSomeone will inevitably ask incredulously, \"Do you actually think you can teach<br />\npeople to write?\" By which they always<br />\nmean, \"Do you think you can give<br />\nsomebody genius or imaginative power?\"<br />\nIt's an interesting question, because you<br />\nnever hear that question asked, say of a<br />\nmusic or a fine arts program\u2014the assumption being that because the skills you find in<br />\nmusic and fine arts are not quite as widespread as the ability to read and write,<br />\nanybody who can read and write and is gifted<br />\nwith talent, that's enough for them. Well,<br />\nthat's certainly been true in the past. but it<br />\nis also the case that some very distinguished<br />\ncontemporary writers have come out of<br />\nwriting programs: John Barth, Flannery<br />\nO'Connor, John Irving . ..<br />\nHere's the thing. Why that whole line of<br />\nquestioning comes up is because in any kind<br />\nof an imaginative art, you will find those kinds<br />\nof questions asked and those kinds of<br />\ncriticisms made because the expectation is<br />\nso high. Which is to say, to write a novel<br /><br />\n'Baker Recalls His Days at Hopkins<br />\nby Russell Baker<br />\n\"I was one of a very small group that<br />\nworkeu under Elliott Coleman during his<br />\nfirst year at Hopkins. There was no<br />\nWriting department then. That came later.<br />\nFor academic purposes, English literature<br />\nwas assumed at Hopkins to have ceased<br />\nwith Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Elliott<br />\ngot in by sneaking under the tent, as it<br />\nwere. During that first semester we met<br />\nat night in a room in the engineering<br />\noutlands of Maryland Hall, and to Elliott<br />\nwe must have been a dispiriting bunch.\"<br />\n\"Most of us had just returned from service in World War Two and, being<br />\nchildren of the Depression, were strongly oriented toward the urgency of making<br />\na buck. Except for two or three of the<br />\ngroup who unashamedly wrote poetry, we<br />\nwanted to succeed commercially at<br />\nwriting. Success in those days meant<br />\npublication in the old, mass-circulation<br />\nmagazines, and a good deal of our energy<br />\nwas directed toward this goal. Our models<br />\nwere Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and<br />\nThomas Wolfe, and our subject matter<br />\nconcentrated heavily on the vaporings and<br />\nadventures of disillusioned war veterans<br />\nin saloons.\"<br />\n\"Elliott's forbearance was saintly and<br />\nhis kindness unfailing. Without them, I<br />\nwould have given up what was an<br />\nunrealistic aspiration early in the day and<br />\npursued my natural destiny to become a<br />\nrailroad brakeman. Finally, however,<br /><br />\nRussell Baker of the New York Times<br /><br />\nFile Photo<br /><br />\nafter struggling through our sevenhundredth short story about disillusioned<br />\nveterans in saloons talking like Ernest<br />\nHemingway, Elliott came in one night and<br />\nquietly broke the news to us.'Hemingway<br />\nis swell,' he said, 'but he is out.'\"<br />\n\"That night he sent us away to read<br />\n\"Ulysses\" and Proust, and study a<br />\nbroader horizon. I was not a good student.<br />\nI still write Hemingway of the Papa period<br />\nbetter than Papa did, and was over 40<br />\nbefore I read \"Ulysses\" all the way<br />\nthrough. I managed it only by reading it<br />\naloud with my wife. A fine book. I am still<br />\nonly in Volume Five of Proust. My wife<br />\nfinds him a bit long-winded for family<br />\nreading.\"<br /><br />\nor to write a poem, as tar as the person wno s<br />\ndoing it, may seem something they're compelled to do. But the existence of a novel or<br />\na poem or any great work of art is wholly<br />\ngratuitous. Anything short of absolute success or perfection seems like an offence. One<br />\nof the things that has happened in recent<br />\nyears is this kind of all-or-nothing situation.<br />\nYou are either a genius or nothing. There<br />\nseems to be no room left for minor art. In part<br />\nit is a side-effect of the kind of hype that<br />\nadvertising does for works of art. Any book<br />\nthat comes out now, you can always find out<br />\nten people who will give you a blurb that<br />\nsays it's the greatest thing since Homer<br />\n. .. Anybody who publishes anything now<br />\nhas to be Hemingway. But that's obviously<br />\ncrazy.<br />\nJust as I don't expect everybody who gets<br />\nthe M.A. is going to end, up on the best-seller<br />\nlist, I don't expect that everybody who gets<br />\nthe B.A. is going end up with some kind of<br />\nlife-long career in writing. The best training for being a perceptive reader of any kind<br />\nof writing is the kind of training that makes<br />\nyou look at writing from the writer's point<br />\nof view. I can't guarantee that everybody<br />\nwho goes through the B.A. or the M.A. will<br />\nend up as a famous writer; I can guarantee<br />\nthat everybody who goes through ends up as<br />\nan excellent reader.<br />\nIf you ask what the undergraduate major<br />\namounts to, it amounts to really a pretty<br />\nhighly structured program that tends to embody the old liberal-arts B.A. What we have<br />\nfound in the last few years is that whereas<br />\nin the Sixties, the feeling among<br />\nundergraduates was that we want to move<br />\nfrom a more structured to a less structured<br />\nprogram, in the late Seventies and certainly<br />\nin the Eighties, the feeling on the part of the<br />\nundergraduates is that they wanted to move<br />\nfrom a less structured to a more structured<br />\nprogram.<br />\nAt Hopkins, it's traditional to think of<br />\nundergraduates as mini-graduate students. I<br />\noften think of it as less of a distinction between undergraduate and graduate students as<br />\nbetween graduate students and apprentice<br />\ngraduate students.<br />\nWhat happened at a lot of places that have<br />\nwriting programs\u2014our major competition<br />\nyou always think to be essentially, Iowa,<br />\nColumbia, Stanford and then the very strong<br />\nprogram at Washington University (that's the<br />\nup-and-coming program)\u2014that those twoyear programs took on essentially a fine-arts<br />\ndegree, the M.F.A. precisely to distinguish<br />\nit from an M.A., which fifty or sixty years<br />\nago meant one thing, but now is sort of an<br />\nintermediate degree toward a Ph.D.<br />\nWe still think of our program not so much<br />\nin the fine-arts school tradition, but in the<br />\ntradition of literature. Therefore, we've kept<br />\nthe M.A. and kept it one year. You know,<br />\nat most places, the way they do their twoyear program is they do all their coursework<br />\nin one year and in the second year, they do<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER'15<br /><br />\nCelebrates Forty 'Years<br />\ntheir apprentice teaching and finish their<br />\nthesis. Here we try to combine it all in one<br />\nyear, for a couple of reasons. We're small.<br />\nTherefore, it's possible for a graduate student to take a course with every person in<br />\nthe department in one year. Secondly, our<br />\nfeeling about the M.A. program has always<br />\nbeen that the person applying doesn't get in<br />\nunless they have already demonstrated a certain level of ability in their writing.<br />\nThere was a doctorate, but it was not a<br />\nwriting degree, so much as the fact that Elliot<br />\nColeman (who directed the program then)<br />\nwanted the kind of program that did give the<br />\nPh.D.; that was very much kind of the<br />\npredecessor of the Humanities Center, a<br />\nhistory of ideas, great books program. I personally don't think a Ph.D. in writing makes<br />\nmuch sense.<br />\nThe kind of apprentice writer that comes<br />\nhere is looking to make a quantum jump in<br />\nhis ability. By making it a jam-packed year,<br />\nin which they are taking courses, teaching<br />\nand doing their own writing, plus with all<br />\nof the other intellectual activity going on<br />\nhere, we have found that that kind of<br />\nalmost pressure-cooker situation is the thing<br />\nthat gets them into that intellectual ferment.<br />\nIts major area of interest has always been<br />\nfiction and poetry and it remains that. But<br />\nwhat has happened in the last ten years is<br />\nwe've added a lot of other areas, simply<br />\nbecause our sense is that good writing is<br />\ngood writing whatever kind of writing it is<br />\nand there is no kind of writing that is not in<br />\nsome sense creative. So in addition to fiction and poetry we've built up drama, took<br />\nover from the Humanities Center the film<br />\nand the video, film history, non-fiction prose,<br />\nscience writing, journalism. . . We may<br />\nat some point, because there are so many fine<br />\nLatin American writers, go in with the<br />\nHispanic and Italian Studies to sponsor a program that will bring more Latin American<br />\nwriters to the program. It's hard to say what<br />\nareas will come up. Before we added those<br />\ncourses in radio, I couldn't have predicted it.<br />\nIt's often after a program has been in existence after a while, you will look back at<br />\nits origin to understand where it stands in<br />\nrelation to its future development.<br />\nJames Boylan, graduate of the Master's<br />\nprogram, fiction writer and currently a<br />\nWriting Seminars instructor, remembers<br />\nwhat the first session of the graduate<br />\nworkshop was like.<br />\nTerrifying, you're there in this room with<br />\nall these other writers who've come from all<br />\nover the country to be there. I remember.<br />\nJohn Barth goes around and introduces<br />\neveryone, tells what they're like as writers,<br />\nand then asks everyone what books they've<br />\nread over the summer. The assumption being that all writers are reading all the time,<br />\nwhich they ought to be; by the time they<br />\nleave this place, they are. When you come<br />\nhere though, there are a lot of people who<br />\nhaven't read anything over the summer. He's<br /><br />\nOa<br /><br />\n4.<br /><br />\nANNIVERSARY<br /><br />\ngoing around the table and I see these looks<br />\nof fear. People say, \"Well, I read, uh . . .\"<br />\nOne woman said she read Huck Finn. Later,<br />\nI asked did she really read Huck Finn? She<br />\nsaid, no, she hadn't read anything in six<br />\nmonths. I asked person after person and they<br />\nall said they made something up on the spot.<br />\nI should say that, a year later, that woman<br />\nread Huck Finn. Not to always be bringing<br />\nthese stories back to a moral, but one of the<br />\nthings that you learn is not only how to be<br />\na good writer, but how to be a good reader.<br />\nSometimes that's the biggest problem. A lot<br />\nof my students\u2014I find they haven't read<br />\nanything. They all want to be famous writers<br />\nand they haven't read anything.<br />\nYou're there with John Barth, who's a<br />\npretty impressive fellow, not only as a writer<br />\nbut as a teacher. So you're sitting there and<br />\nI think everybody always feels the program's<br />\nmade a mistake in letting them in and they<br />\ndon't really know what lousy writers they<br />\nare. But that fear is one of the things that<br />\ndrives you. . .But the fact that John Barth<br />\ncalls you to ask you to come and you know<br />\nthat maybe you are on to something, maybe<br />\nyou should have more faith in yourself.

Rated R.<br />\nIt's a shame that amid the<br />\nhoopla over Platoon many people<br />\nwill overlook the new Bob<br />\nRafelson film, Black Widow.<br />\nRafelson's first feature, Five Easy<br />\nPieces, gave the world the most<br />\nmemorable chicken-salad scene<br />\nand linked him with that group of<br />\nyoung directors who were reenergizing American cinema in<br />\nthe early seventies, including<br />\nGeorge Lucas and Robert<br />\nAltman. Unlike Lucas and<br />\nAltman, Rafelson has managed to<br />\ncontinued producing quality<br />\nfilms. Black Widow has been<br />\ncompared to Jagged Edge, that<br />\ncourtroom mess which had all the<br />\nsuspense of a Road Runner cartoon. Black Widow is, rather, the<br />\nmost effective thriller to come<br />\naround since Blood Simple, and<br />\nlike that film, it draws from the<br />\nfilm noir genre for its atmosphere. This gives an arty,<br />\nsmall budget feel to it, although<br />\nit is a decidedly big money, big<br />\ncast production.<br />\nThe plot is juicy: a woman<br />\nwhose identity no one is sure of<br />\n(Theresa Russell) is marrying<br />\nwealthy men, murdering them,<br />\nand inheriting their money. First,<br />\nas a Chicago socialite, she<br />\npoisons her publishing magnate<br />\nhusband. She leaves New York<br />\nfor Dallas, where she poses as a<br />\nCharleston belle and marries a<br />\ntoy tycoon. She slips from New<br /><br />\nYork chic to Southern hospitality as easily as she slips the<br />\nodorless poison into her husband's brandy.<br />\nEnter Alex Barnes (Debra<br />\nWinger), a data analyst for the<br />\nJustice Department. Alex notices<br />\na connection between these<br />\nwealthy men who all pass away<br />\nshortly after marrying. This intrigues her, and she spends her<br />\nfree time trying to track down the<br />\nmurderess. She has a lot of free<br />\ntime, as she oddly avoids dating<br />\nmen. Alex and \"the widow\" are<br />\na study in opposites: one scruffy,<br />\nneurotic, building a life void of<br />\nmen;<br />\nthe<br />\nother<br />\ncool,<br />\nsophisticated, building her life<br />\naround men.<br />\nRonald Bass's screenplay picks<br />\nup as we are let in to see Russell<br />\nprepare for her next victim. She<br />\nchooses Edwin McCory (Nicol<br />\nWilliamson), millionaire coin<br />\ncollector. Russell studies ancient<br />\ncoins and appears at McCory's \u2022<br />\nmuseum as a charming New<br />\nEnglander. She makes a huge<br />\ndonation, gets on the board of<br />\ndirectors, and begins to flirt with<br />\nMcCory. Her technique is<br />\nfascinating, as Russell uses makeup, hair dye, and acting to assume<br />\nwhole new identities and change<br />\nages.<br />\nAnd she doesn't pick easy<br />\nprey, dumb pansies who live in<br />\nthe world of the gullible. McCory<br />\nnotes her interest in coins and<br />\nsays, \"I bet you looked those up<br />\njust to impress me.\" Edwin<br />\nchecks her credentials and finds<br />\nthat, yes, she is the dream girl<br />\nfrom Mount Holyoke College he<br />\nwas meant to marry.<br /><br />\nMurder Wealthy Husbands,<br />\nEntrance Pursuing Cop<br />\nMeanwhil, Winger realizes<br />\nwho the killer is and goes to prove<br />\nit to herself. She lets Russell<br />\nknow that she is snooping around<br />\nand that she is staying at the<br />\nHilton, and Russell goes there.<br />\nThere she is told that Winger<br />\ntransferred to another hotel, but<br />\nstalwart Debra is just hiding<br />\nacross the street from the second<br />\nhotel, waiting to see if Russell<br />\nwill follow that far. Russell does,<br />\nand Winger has the proof to continue the chase. In a fantastic moment, Russell realizes she's been<br />\nduped and has a conniption fit in<br />\nher car.<br />\nParanoid, Russell makes quick<br />\nwork of McCory and leaves for<br />\nHawaii. Against the advice of her<br />\nboss (Dennis Hopper), Barnes<br />\nquits her dull job and pursues. In<br />\nHawaii the film opens up, and the<br />\nscenery opens up as well, turning<br />\nfrom boardrooms and bedrooms<br />\nto volcanoes and rivers. Lush<br />\ngreens and deep blues provide an<br />\nalluring backdrop as the pace<br />\nquickens. Russell has set her<br />\nsights on Paul (Sami Frey), a<br />\nhotel developer. Under an assumed name, Barnes joins a scuba<br />\nclass and befriends Russell. From<br />\nthere on, it is a stylish match of<br />\nwits.<br />\nThis is an odd, teasing movie.<br />\nThe scenery teases as it<br />\ncharms\u2014Rafelson's<br />\nselfconscious direction teases with its<br />\nimages\u2014and the actresses tease<br />\ntheir men and each other. As<br />\nWinger becomes more like<br />\nRussell, their relationship gains\u2022<br />\nan uneasy sexual tension. Winger<br />\nand Russell flirt with each other.<br />\nAt one point in which Winger is<br />\ngiving Russell mouth-to-mouth,-<br /><br />\nshe says, \"I hope you don't take<br />\nthis personally.\" The film is<br />\nchock full of good lines like that,<br />\nas when Russell boldly announces<br />\nto a sleazy private-eye, \"Let me<br />\ntell you two things about myself.<br />\nI'm rich . . . and I'm wealthy.\"<br />\nSami Frey is sexy enough as<br />\nPaul, but Williamson and Hopper<br />\nare wasted in their roles as colorless, \"nice\" guys. One can't<br />\nhelp but imagine that Hitchcock<br />\nwould have turned the men into<br />\neccentrics, but Rafelson gives the<br />\nmovie totally to Russell and<br />\nWinger. Debra Winger plays the<br />\nsame scruffy, bookish role she<br />\ntook in Legal Eagles, only she<br />\ntrades the humor for obsession.<br />\nBetween that movie and this one,<br />\nshe seems to be constructing<br />\nsome sort of unattractive \"image\" which undermines the sexy<br />\ncharisma that made her stand out<br />\nin An Officer and a Gentleman.<br />\nWhile she won't win any<br />\nOscars as long as there are<br />\npitiable farm girls the Academy<br />\ncan idealize, Theresa Russell<br />\nturns in one of the best performances of 1987. There is some<br />\ninternal rage, pity and love which<br />\nfuels this dynamo of evil. Russell<br />\nis, at the same time, stunningly<br />\nelegant and seductive. Rafelson<br />\nhas toned down her \"admissions\" to Winger, and keeps the<br />\naudience guessing at her true<br />\nmotives. In a move that most noir<br />\nwould shun, he keeps the audience guessing even after the<br />\nmovie's over. It works, and the<br />\nfilm emerges as a well-made<br />\ncharacter study, tense and full of<br />\ntwists.

These aspects include<br />\nphysical addiction to an activity<br /><br />\nchanged by repetition of a certain<br />\nstimulus. \"Repetition of<br />\nsomething tends to make people<br />\nmore fond of it and hence changes<br />\na person's attitudes and<br />\nbehavior,\" says Dr. Breckler. He<br />\ncited this as the reason behind<br />\ntelevision and radio advertisements. The constant repetition<br />\nof jingles and images tends to<br />\nmake the viewer or listener look<br />\nmore favorably on a product and<br />\ntherefore influences his purchasing behavior.

He will instead spend the time out \"in the<br />\nfield\", gathering data, then piecing it together and pulling it apart<br />\nat his computer, and finally coming up with an answer or explanation to his research problem. As<br />\na social psychologist, his research<br />\nproblems are people problems, a<br />\nsearch for why people have the<br />\nattitudes they do, how they were<br />\nformed and what can be done<br />\nabout them.

Although<br />\nnew to the field of academia,<br />\nBreckler seems to have made the<br />\ntransition well, teaching and<br />\nspending his time researching<br />\na variety of topics in his field.<br />\nThe National Science Foundation chose to recognize Breckler's<br />\nresearching skills recently by<br />\nnaming him as a winner of one of<br />\nits prestigious Presidential Young<br />\nInvestigator Awards. Breckler<br />\nwas one of two researchers affiliated with Hopkins to receive<br />\nthe award which honors scientists<br />\nand engineers who have receiv-<br /><br />\ned their PhD's in the last five<br />\nyears. The award includes a grant<br />\nto further the research goals of its<br />\nrecipient.<br />\nBreckler's current research<br />\ndeals with the topic of blood ,<br />\ndonors and their attitudes to giving blood. Besides the fact that<br />\nthere is a constant short supply of<br />\nblood available for medical use,<br />\nwhich presents a psychological<br />\nproblem in itself, an especially<br />\ntroublesome and not so well<br />\nstudied problem is the fact that a<br />\nvery small percentage of firsttime donors ever make a second<br />\ndonation. The reasons for this<br />\nphenomenon are baffling the Red<br />\nCross and Dr. Breckler feels that<br />\nit is a pressing enough concern<br />\nthat needs to be addressed.<br />\nPsychologists have not been<br />\nable to explain the phenomena so<br />\nfar. \"Understandably,\" began<br />\nBreckler, \"people are afraid of<br />\ngiving blood, they are afraid of<br />\nthe pain, and they don't like the<br />\nassociation they make with blood<br />\ndonating and sick people. People<br />\nwill make up all sorts of excuses<br />\nto avoid giving blood, such as<br />\ncontracting AIDS, even though<br />\nthose fears are unfounded.\"<br />\nAfter donating blood, however,<br />\npeople experience a major shift in<br />\ntheir attitudes. \"Most people feel<br />\nvery happy after giving blood,\"<br />\ncontinued Dr. Breckler, \"They<br />\nfeel like they've done something<br />\ngood and worthwhile for society<br />\nand nearly all of them say they<br />\nwould do it again. The sad truth<br />\nis that most of those people will<br />\nnot return.\" According to Dr.<br />\nBreckler, current thought is that<br />\npresumably all the fears that had<br />\nto be overcome before making the<br />\nfirst donation have been allayed<br />\nafter the experience of giving<br />\n\u2022blood. Since most people<br />\nresponded that the experience<br />\nwas a positive one and that the<br />\ncause a worthy one, they should<br />\nbe expected to come back. Such<br />\nis \"unfortunately not the case.\"<br />\nDr. Breckler is at the start of<br />\na long project to be conducted<br />\nwith persons who have not<br /><br />\nsuch as cigarette smoking where<br />\nphysiological as well as<br />\npsychological treatment is<br />\na break at his Rotunda Office<br />\nnecessary to stop a person from<br />\nsmoking.

Against the very<br />\nstrong team from Vassar College,<br />\nthey fought to a 5-4 victory.<br />\nthey face Vassar again at the<br />\nMACFA Championships it will<br />\nbe doubly important to dominate.<br />\nVassar is considered to be one of<br />\nHopkins' main rivals for the conference title. In addition to looking at the team records it is also<br />\nimportant to note the individual<br />\nperformances. The top three<br />\nfoilsmen turned in fine performances for the day: Craig Chun<br />\n(5-2), Chai Kulsakdinun (6-1),<br />\nand David Cohen (5-3). Backing<br />\nthem up were Paul Fox (2-0) and<br />\nJeremy Golub (0-2), and the<br />\nnewest foil team member Bob<br />\nLee (0-1). The foil team's season<br />\nrecord now stands at a very im- .<br />\npressive 15-3. This weekend's<br />\nmeets at Newark are the last<br />\nbefore the MAC's. This will be<br />\nthe team's last chance to sharpen<br />\ntheir skills before the fight for the<br /><br />\ntitle. Judging from the foil team's<br />\npast record this year, they stand<br />\na chance of winning their weapon<br />\nat the MAC's.<br />\nAs the year draws to a close,<br />\nthoughts turn towards next year<br />\nwhen the foil team will release its<br />\nsecret weapon: Mike Greenfield<br />\nwho has been red-shirted for the<br />\nyear in order to undergo an intensive training program.

The epee<br />\nteam lost a staggering six bouts<br />\nby 5-4 scores. Vassar's epeemen, including one three-year<br />\nstarter and one two-year starter,<br />\nsimply had the edge in experience<br />\nto help them win the close bouts,<br />\nas well as fencing in a frustrating,<br />\ndefensive style.<br />\nOn the day, Tomasso was<br />\n(4-3), Poehler (4-5) and Chen<br />\n(1-6) while Lumby and Runge<br />\nwere a combined (0-4).

Against the<br />\nMAC teams only, Tomasso leads<br />\nalso with a mark of(19-8), while<br />\nPoehler is (15-4) and Chen<br />\n(7-18). Look for the fast-learning<br />\nepeemen to improve their showing against the tough teams in the<br />\nupcoming MAC postseason tournament, where they will get<br />\nanother shot ay such teams as<br />\nLafayette, William &amp; Mary and<br /><br />\nVassar, as well as numerous<br />\nlesser opponents.<br />\nDespite the disappointing<br />\ndefeat to Vassar, the sabre team<br />\nhad an impressive day, which<br />\nPegaki with a 8-1 victory over<br />\nVMI.

The second string was then thrown in to<br />\nbring the sabre team to a 6-3 victory.

Of course, that was<br />\nbefore she entered the Home for the Criminally Zionist. My<br />\nfavorite quizzes are Rorschach Tests, because they are almost<br />\nalways on a Pass-Fail basis. Basically this weeks quiz is another<br />\nin a series of attempts at avoiding the harshness of life and death,<br />\ncrime and punishment, and milk with meat. All entries will be considered, but there might be a little preference given to short kids<br />\nwith big noses and glasses (I'd wear a Groucho disguise, but. . .it<br />\nonly makes me look more like me). Get your entries to the NewsLetter Screening Room by Wednesday at 5 p.m., pop corn breath.<br /><br />\nResults: I'm going to torture you to find the results to last week's<br />\nquiz: you have to actually open up this paper if you want to see<br />\nthem.
