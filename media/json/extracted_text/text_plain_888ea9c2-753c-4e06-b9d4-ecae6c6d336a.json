A considerably smaller number of graduate students voted than was the case for the undergraduates (170<br />\ngraduate students voted as compared to 805 undergraduates). But while the smaller percentage of graduate students<br />\npolled (15% of the graduate students as compared to 54%<br />\nof the undregracls voted) raises some cautions in interpretation of the results-----due to questions concerning the representativeness of those who voted\u2014the differences between the<br />\ndistribution of graduate student votes across the 5 alternatives presented on the ballot, and that of the undergraduates.<br />\nIs large enough to indicate the existence of a sharp cleavage<br />\nin orientation toward the Viet Nam war between the two<br />\ngroups.<br />\nFor while the results of the poll show the Undergraduates as tending to favor \"escalation the LBJ way,\" or an<br />\neven more Hawkish stance, the graduate students are clearly<br />\nmore pacific\u2014with \"doves\" predominating.

We often lose track of our original<br />\ngoals and purposes over long periods of time,<br />\nand wind up heading in a direction which we<br />\nnever intended in the first place.<br />\nLast Friday's meeting of the Inter-Fraternity<br />\nCouncil and its decision to do nothing about<br />\nthe social probationary status of the Phi Kappa<br />\nPsi Fraternity is a clear example of how our<br />\noriginal intentions can be led astray. Let us<br />\nexamine the situation which led to the placing<br />\nof Phi Psi on probation and then let us<br />\nweigh it against the action of the I.F.C.<br />\n. Eight pledges from Phi Psi created a community uproar by attempting to take down<br />\nthe flag at Fort McHenry. Public sentiment<br />\ndemanded immediate action. The administration acted quickly, placing the individuals involved on social probation and allocating penalties to each. The I.F.C. also acted, for the<br />\nPhi Psi brotherhood had accepted full responsibility for the action of their pledges, and<br />\nplaced Phi Psi under social probation for a<br />\nyear.<br />\nThis was the second time that a fraternity<br />\nhad been placed on social probation by the<br />\nI.F.C. However, the restrictions placed upon<br />\nPhi Psi were without precedent. Never before<br />\nhad a fraternity been forbidden to engage in<br />\nB.I.A. fraternity competition or to pledge anyone. It was the understanding of all parties<br />\nconcerned at the hearing last spring that these<br />\nmeasures had to be taken to appease public<br />\ncommotion over the flag incident. Also the representatives of Phi Psi were led to believe that<br />\ntheir case would be reviewed at the end of the<br />\nfirst semester of this year. If the Fraternity<br />\nhad lived up to the restrictions placed upon it<br />\nand if the incident had become a dead one<br />\npublicly, Phi Psis were led to believe that they<br />\nwould be reinstated to normal fraternity status.<br />\nThe first semester quickly passed and the<br />\nonly public utterance about the incident was a<br />\nstatement by the V.F.W. concerning foreign<br />\nexchange students. For all practical purposes,<br />\nthe issue had become a dead one.<br />\nPhi Psi, accepting the restrictions placed<br />\nupon it. attempted to keep the slate clean during the first semester in order to get off probation. Rumors, however, began to spread toward the end of November and early December<br />\nof the \"dirty rushing\" of Phi Psi and how the<br />\nFraternity had not lived up to the party restrictions.<br />\nThe big day came last week for Phi Psi and<br />\nall the Brothers reasonably expected that they<br />\nwould be let off probation. However, they had<br />\nnot counted on time dulling the minds of many<br />\nI.F.C. representatives.<br />\nStrange things happened at the IFJ.C. meeting on January 14. First, Phi Psi was not permitted to attend the meeting at which its most<br />\nvital interests were concerned. Dave Kagan,<br />\nPresident of Phi Psi. was told to sit outside<br />\nthe meeting room. If anyone had any questions,<br />\nKagan was to be called in to answer them. No<br />\none had any questions.<br />\nInside, even more mysterious things were<br />\nhappening. The presiding officer asked for discussion on the Phi Psi case and the immediate<br />\nresponse was a motion not to even consider<br />\nthe subject. Before anyone could even discuss<br />\nthat motion and possibly present Phi Psi's side<br />\nof the story, a motion to end debate was entertained and passed.<br />\nA vote was then taken. But it was not in the<br />\nnormal ballot procedure. Rather, it was a vote<br />\nby secret ballot.<br />\nThe Phi Psi President was then told that<br />\nthe I.F.C. had decided not to review the case<br />\n<br />\nbut that he should come back next week because they were going to discuss whether or<br />\nnot to uphold Section Three of the penalty.<br />\nSection Three restricts Phi Psi from pledging anyone. Contained within that section is<br />\na clause which says that if Phi Psi remains on<br />\ngood behavior during first semester, then the<br />\nprobation on pledging should be alleviated.<br />\nGood behavior is defined by the I.F.C. as not<br />\nbeing convicted of a rush violation.<br />\nIf the I.F.C. does follow through on the<br />\nwording of the section, they could permit Phi<br />\nPsi to rush and take a pledge class next semester. However, Section One and Two are still<br />\napplicable. This means that Phi Psi cannot<br />\nhave any parties for the rest of the year nor<br />\nparticipate in B.I.A. fraternity competition.<br />\nAs might be imagined, Kagan and the other<br />\nsixty Brothers of Phi Psi were quite upset over<br />\nthe actions of the I.F.C. They had been placed<br />\non social probation to appease an irate public<br />\nand had been given the impression that if they<br />\nlived up to the restrictions placed on them,<br />\ntheir case would be reviewed at the end of the<br />\nfirst semester and that they would be taken off<br />\nprobation.<br />\nAfter a semester of probation, they face an<br />\nI.F.C. that refuses even to consider their case,<br />\nlet alone give them a chance to present their<br />\nside of the story. Still even more perplexing is<br />\nthe fact that the Brothers of Phi Psi were not<br />\neven told what they had done wrong to deserve<br />\na continuation of a punishment which no<br />\nlonger had any relation to the situation it was<br />\ntrying to alleviate.<br />\nThere seemed to be a concensus at the I.F.C.<br />\nmeeting that Phi Psi had been doing a lot of<br />\n\"dirty rushing\" and that they really did not<br />\ndeserve to get off probation. But even if rumors<br />\nof specific rush violations were suitable grounds<br />\nfor punishing Phi Psi, no one even stepped<br />\nforward to make any accusations or expositions. Since when has the judicial board condemned any fraternity for dirty rushing on<br />\nthe basis of hearsay?<br />\nWhat the action of the I.F.C. boils down<br />\nto is quite simple. A punishment which had<br />\nbeen the means of soothing an angry public<br />\nwas being extended to appease the personal<br />\nprejudices of a few representatives, thus endangering the stability of the fraternity system at Johns Hopkins. They have permitted<br />\nincidents of the past and personal grievances<br />\nwith individual Brothers to reign supreme in<br />\ntheir criteria of evaluation. Rush has become<br />\nall important in their minds.<br />\nPhi Psi was pronounced guilty last Friday<br />\nwithout any semblance of a judicious trial. The<br />\nBrotherhood has not been told what it has<br />\ndone wrong nor what it should do to get itself<br />\noff probation. It has acted on the understanding that good behavior would result in a favorable decision by the I.F.C. when the entire<br />\ncase was reviewed. However, no such review<br />\nhas yet taken place.<br />\nThe I.F.C.'s action in this case can only<br />\nhave detrimental effects upon the fraternity<br />\nsystem. By dealing with Phi Psi in the manner in which it did, it has demonstrated a<br />\ncomplete lack of responsibility. Little regard<br />\nwas given to the Brothers who have been under<br />\nsocial probation for a semester. And little regard was given to the serious consequences<br />\nwhich may follow an action which threw away<br />\nall semblance of judicious and responsible<br />\npractice to study the first significant problem<br />\never before the I.F.C. The fraternity system at<br />\nHopkins suffered a serious setback when the<br />\nI.F.C., in essence, allowed personal bias and<br />\nhearsay to govern its function as a deliberative<br />\nand judicial (i.e. rational and just) body.<br />\n<br />\nPAID ADVERTISEMENT<br />\n<br />\nCASH<br />\nFOR YOUR<br />\n<br />\nBOOKS<br />\nThursday, January 27, 1966<br />\nAND<br />\n<br />\nFriday, January 28, 1955<br />\nUsed Books will be bought by the<br />\nBooksfore on the above dates,<br />\nfrom 9:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.

JANUARY 21, 1966<br />\n<br />\nREPUBLICAN BIAS<br />\n<br />\nBlock Repeal Of 14b!!<br />\nBy GEOFFREY LEBAR<br />\nThe recent mass transit strike<br />\nin New York City does not prove<br />\nthat section 14b of the TaftHartley Act should be repealed.<br />\nAlthough it seems that such a<br />\ndramatic strike will affect the<br />\nrepeal. The labor problem should<br />\nbe considered on its merits.<br />\nThe Republican minority in<br />\nthe last session of Congress was<br />\nable to block the repeal of the<br />\n\"right to work law\" mainly because it offered a positive program to control the abuses of<br />\nlabor. The repeal of section 14b<br />\nIs only symbolic. It affects only<br />\n19 of the least industrial states.<br />\nBut the two major Republican<br />\ndemands on labor would have a<br />\nrevolutionary effect. RepubliCCM propose: I) to eliminate<br />\nall types of racial discrimination<br />\nfrom unions and 2) to provide<br />\n<br />\nstiff penalities for unions using<br />\nmembership dues to aid specific<br />\npolitical candidates.<br />\nThis second provision would<br />\nnot outlaw general money grants<br />\nto the parties. Of course, the<br />\nDemocrats will claim that big<br />\nbusiness serves the Republican<br />\ncoffers, and therefore labor<br />\nshould serve the Democrats<br />\nsimilarly. But that just is not so.<br />\nContributions made in the name<br />\nof big corporations like Johnson<br />\nand Johnson, Dupont, General<br />\nMotors, etc., were made in equal<br />\namounts to each political party<br />\nduring the recent campaigns. It<br />\nmay be true that certain business executives contribute to the<br />\nRepublican party. But they do<br />\nnot contribute company money.<br />\nUnion leaders may contribute to<br />\nthe Democratic party, but they<br />\n<br />\nshoud not use membership dues.<br />\nLabor unions have a good<br />\nrecord on civil rights on paper,<br />\nbut their membership lists are<br />\noften lilly white. At the recent<br />\nnational AFL-CIO convention at<br />\nSan Francisco, a newsman<br />\ncounted only 20 negro delegates<br />\nout of a total of 922, and most<br />\nof them came from N.Y.C.<br />\n<br />\nber 20, 1964 on criminal charges<br />\nof depriving a Negro laborer of<br />\nemployment opportunity. They<br />\nwere accused of conspiracy and<br />\n\"discrimination against a Negro<br />\nworking man by depriving him<br />\nbecause of his raoe and color<br />\nof his civil rights to obtain employment.\"<br />\nThis case was the first criminal<br />\nprosecution attempted under N.Y.<br />\nState's anti-discrimination laws,<br />\nOn July 16, 1963, Barry Goldwater, of all people, introduced<br />\nan amendment to the Civil<br />\nRights Act of 1964 which would<br />\nhave outlawed labor union racial<br />\ndiscrimination. It was defeated<br />\nby the Democratic majority on<br />\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.<br />\n<br />\nhearings on the Civil Rights Bill,<br />\nand said he agreed \"in principle\"<br />\nwith the amendment proposed by<br />\nSenator Goldwater which \"would<br />\ndeny certification to labor unions<br />\nrefusing membership because of<br />\nrace.\"<br />\nWhile the unions were discouraging civil rights legislation,<br />\nthe<br />\nRepublican<br />\nconservative<br />\nsenator from Texas, John Tower<br />\nwas doing something for civil<br />\nrights. On October 1, 1963,<br />\nTower voted to extend the life<br />\nof the Civil Rights Commission<br />\nfor another year. The vote was<br />\n70-15; all 15 negative votes were<br />\ncast by southern Democrats.<br />\n<br />\nThe New York State Commission for Human Rights ruled on<br />\nMarch 4, 1964 that Local 28 of<br />\nthe Sheet Metal Workers International Association has \"automatically<br />\nexcluded\"<br />\nNegroes<br />\nfrom membership throughout<br />\nthe union's 76 year history.<br />\nThomas P. McLinskey, ex-business agent of Steamlitters Local<br />\nOn August 14, 1963, John<br />\n638, and Jules Shurkman, a New<br />\nTwo days later on July 18,<br />\nYork lawyer, were indicted by a 1963, Willard Wirtz testified at Tower and Jacob Javits coN.Y. County grand jury Novem- Senate Commerce Committee sponsored an anti-discrimination rider to the Domestic Peace<br />\nCorps bill. It was defeated 49-41<br />\nwith a large majority of the<br />\nnegative votes being cast by<br />\nDemocrats not necessarily from<br />\nthe South. Senator Tower voted<br />\nagainst the Civil Rights Bill in<br />\n1964 and now is said to regret it.<br />\nHe will introduce civil rights<br />\nlegislation again to alter any<br />\nsegregationist image he may<br />\nhave acquired.<br />\nThe whole point of this discussion is not to condemn labor<br />\nunions or glorify Goldwater and<br />\nTower's record. Neither is great,<br />\nand both will be better in the<br />\nfuture. But at least Republicans<br />\ncan take credit for honestly<br />\nacknowledging the problem of<br />\ndiscrimination where it actually<br />\nexists outside of the South.

This represents 18% of<br />\nthe undergraduate body. This<br />\nmeans 67.9% of those voting did<br />\nnot agree with the administration policy. The mandate defeated its purpose and now we<br />\ncan rightfully be branded as<br />\nmilitarists with a smattering of<br />\npacifists among us. We just cannot win.<br />\nBut we digress. We take issue<br />\nwith the prerogative of the<br />\nCouncil to violate the confidence<br />\nof the student body. We would<br />\nbet guns to butter that those<br />\nwho thundered \"show the world<br />\nwhere we stand\" would have<br />\nbeen silent as church mice had<br />\nthe vote been for pulling out of<br />\nVietnam. The motion would<br />\nnever have reached the floor.<br />\nThe comment was made in<br />\nCouncil that SDS would have<br />\nexploited the news; but no matter what the outcome it would<br />\nhave been announced in the<br />\nNews-Letter--and rightfully so.<br />\nWhy the publicity? Surely, it<br />\nIs of little consequence that 18%<br />\nHopkins'<br />\nundergraduates<br />\nof<br />\nvoted to support administration<br />\nVietnam policy. We submit that<br />\nsuch figures are unlikely to convince the Baltimore community<br />\nthat its impression of Homewood<br />\nas a focal point for anti-war<br />\nsentiment is incorrect; in fact<br />\nthat impression, fostered by unfavorable and injudicious newspaper coverage in October, has<br />\nundoubtedly dissipated. Hence,<br />\nCouncil action will serve only to<br />\nrevive local antagonism, yet will<br />\nnot lessen it.<br />\nFurther, it seems to us that<br />\nthe Council has proceeded with<br />\nundue haste on one count, yet<br />\nsuffers from \"over-inertia\" on<br />\nanother. Why, we wonder, did<br />\nthe Council presume knowledge<br />\nof Baltimore opinion, yet feel<br />\nconstrained to sample Hopkins'<br />\n<br />\nfeelings before making a definitive judgement similar to that<br />\nit had already made about the<br />\nsurrounding<br />\ncommunity?<br />\nIt<br />\nseems reasonable to expect that<br />\nthe Student Council, an official<br />\norganization of The Johns Hopkins University, would feel more<br />\ncompetent to make a priori<br />\njudgements about campus opinion. (This, in fact, was done<br />\nonly implicitly in that it was obvious that most Council members assumed that student opinion would prove to favor administration policy in Vietnam). In<br />\nlight of the foregoing the logical<br />\nand truly honest extension of<br />\nthe Council's motives and intent<br />\nwould have been to first conduct<br />\na poll of the entire Baltimore<br />\ncommunity to see whether, in<br />\nfact, Baltimore did view Hopkins in the manner the Council<br />\nso blithely assumed it did.<br />\nAdmittedly, several of our<br />\ncomments may border on the<br />\nfacetious. Setting them aside, we<br />\nfeel that the Council's action<br />\nwas a grave mistake. Shelley<br />\nEarp is to be commended for<br />\ncasting the decisive ballot which<br />\nensured that the poll's results<br />\nwould not be sent to President<br />\nJohnson\u2014that would have multiplied the error. It is unfortunate that his refusal to conceive<br />\nof the poll as a \"mandate\" did<br />\nnot persuade the Council. Finally, we note that 46% of Hopkins' undergraduates saw fit not<br />\nto participate in the poll. Such<br />\ninaction led directly to the<br />\nquandry in which we are now<br />\ninvolved. We hope that these<br />\n4F's do not continue to refuse<br />\nto exercise their franchise.<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nLarry S.

A considerably smaller number of graduate students voted than was the case for the undergraduates (170<br />\ngraduate students voted as compared to 805 undergraduates). But while the smaller percentage of graduate students<br />\npolled (15% of the graduate students as compared to 54%<br />\nof the undregracls voted) raises some cautions in interpretation of the results-----due to questions concerning the representativeness of those who voted\u2014the differences between the<br />\ndistribution of graduate student votes across the 5 alternatives presented on the ballot, and that of the undergraduates.<br />\nIs large enough to indicate the existence of a sharp cleavage<br />\nin orientation toward the Viet Nam war between the two<br />\ngroups.<br />\nFor while the results of the poll show the Undergraduates as tending to favor \"escalation the LBJ way,\" or an<br />\neven more Hawkish stance, the graduate students are clearly<br />\nmore pacific\u2014with \"doves\" predominating.

We often lose track of our original<br />\ngoals and purposes over long periods of time,<br />\nand wind up heading in a direction which we<br />\nnever intended in the first place.<br />\nLast Friday's meeting of the Inter-Fraternity<br />\nCouncil and its decision to do nothing about<br />\nthe social probationary status of the Phi Kappa<br />\nPsi Fraternity is a clear example of how our<br />\noriginal intentions can be led astray. Let us<br />\nexamine the situation which led to the placing<br />\nof Phi Psi on probation and then let us<br />\nweigh it against the action of the I.F.C.<br />\n. Eight pledges from Phi Psi created a community uproar by attempting to take down<br />\nthe flag at Fort McHenry. Public sentiment<br />\ndemanded immediate action. The administration acted quickly, placing the individuals involved on social probation and allocating penalties to each. The I.F.C. also acted, for the<br />\nPhi Psi brotherhood had accepted full responsibility for the action of their pledges, and<br />\nplaced Phi Psi under social probation for a<br />\nyear.<br />\nThis was the second time that a fraternity<br />\nhad been placed on social probation by the<br />\nI.F.C. However, the restrictions placed upon<br />\nPhi Psi were without precedent. Never before<br />\nhad a fraternity been forbidden to engage in<br />\nB.I.A. fraternity competition or to pledge anyone. It was the understanding of all parties<br />\nconcerned at the hearing last spring that these<br />\nmeasures had to be taken to appease public<br />\ncommotion over the flag incident. Also the representatives of Phi Psi were led to believe that<br />\ntheir case would be reviewed at the end of the<br />\nfirst semester of this year. If the Fraternity<br />\nhad lived up to the restrictions placed upon it<br />\nand if the incident had become a dead one<br />\npublicly, Phi Psis were led to believe that they<br />\nwould be reinstated to normal fraternity status.<br />\nThe first semester quickly passed and the<br />\nonly public utterance about the incident was a<br />\nstatement by the V.F.W. concerning foreign<br />\nexchange students. For all practical purposes,<br />\nthe issue had become a dead one.<br />\nPhi Psi, accepting the restrictions placed<br />\nupon it. attempted to keep the slate clean during the first semester in order to get off probation. Rumors, however, began to spread toward the end of November and early December<br />\nof the \"dirty rushing\" of Phi Psi and how the<br />\nFraternity had not lived up to the party restrictions.<br />\nThe big day came last week for Phi Psi and<br />\nall the Brothers reasonably expected that they<br />\nwould be let off probation. However, they had<br />\nnot counted on time dulling the minds of many<br />\nI.F.C. representatives.<br />\nStrange things happened at the IFJ.C. meeting on January 14. First, Phi Psi was not permitted to attend the meeting at which its most<br />\nvital interests were concerned. Dave Kagan,<br />\nPresident of Phi Psi. was told to sit outside<br />\nthe meeting room. If anyone had any questions,<br />\nKagan was to be called in to answer them. No<br />\none had any questions.<br />\nInside, even more mysterious things were<br />\nhappening. The presiding officer asked for discussion on the Phi Psi case and the immediate<br />\nresponse was a motion not to even consider<br />\nthe subject. Before anyone could even discuss<br />\nthat motion and possibly present Phi Psi's side<br />\nof the story, a motion to end debate was entertained and passed.<br />\nA vote was then taken. But it was not in the<br />\nnormal ballot procedure. Rather, it was a vote<br />\nby secret ballot.<br />\nThe Phi Psi President was then told that<br />\nthe I.F.C. had decided not to review the case<br /><br />\nbut that he should come back next week because they were going to discuss whether or<br />\nnot to uphold Section Three of the penalty.<br />\nSection Three restricts Phi Psi from pledging anyone. Contained within that section is<br />\na clause which says that if Phi Psi remains on<br />\ngood behavior during first semester, then the<br />\nprobation on pledging should be alleviated.<br />\nGood behavior is defined by the I.F.C. as not<br />\nbeing convicted of a rush violation.<br />\nIf the I.F.C. does follow through on the<br />\nwording of the section, they could permit Phi<br />\nPsi to rush and take a pledge class next semester. However, Section One and Two are still<br />\napplicable. This means that Phi Psi cannot<br />\nhave any parties for the rest of the year nor<br />\nparticipate in B.I.A. fraternity competition.<br />\nAs might be imagined, Kagan and the other<br />\nsixty Brothers of Phi Psi were quite upset over<br />\nthe actions of the I.F.C. They had been placed<br />\non social probation to appease an irate public<br />\nand had been given the impression that if they<br />\nlived up to the restrictions placed on them,<br />\ntheir case would be reviewed at the end of the<br />\nfirst semester and that they would be taken off<br />\nprobation.<br />\nAfter a semester of probation, they face an<br />\nI.F.C. that refuses even to consider their case,<br />\nlet alone give them a chance to present their<br />\nside of the story. Still even more perplexing is<br />\nthe fact that the Brothers of Phi Psi were not<br />\neven told what they had done wrong to deserve<br />\na continuation of a punishment which no<br />\nlonger had any relation to the situation it was<br />\ntrying to alleviate.<br />\nThere seemed to be a concensus at the I.F.C.<br />\nmeeting that Phi Psi had been doing a lot of<br />\n\"dirty rushing\" and that they really did not<br />\ndeserve to get off probation. But even if rumors<br />\nof specific rush violations were suitable grounds<br />\nfor punishing Phi Psi, no one even stepped<br />\nforward to make any accusations or expositions. Since when has the judicial board condemned any fraternity for dirty rushing on<br />\nthe basis of hearsay?<br />\nWhat the action of the I.F.C. boils down<br />\nto is quite simple. A punishment which had<br />\nbeen the means of soothing an angry public<br />\nwas being extended to appease the personal<br />\nprejudices of a few representatives, thus endangering the stability of the fraternity system at Johns Hopkins. They have permitted<br />\nincidents of the past and personal grievances<br />\nwith individual Brothers to reign supreme in<br />\ntheir criteria of evaluation. Rush has become<br />\nall important in their minds.<br />\nPhi Psi was pronounced guilty last Friday<br />\nwithout any semblance of a judicious trial. The<br />\nBrotherhood has not been told what it has<br />\ndone wrong nor what it should do to get itself<br />\noff probation. It has acted on the understanding that good behavior would result in a favorable decision by the I.F.C. when the entire<br />\ncase was reviewed. However, no such review<br />\nhas yet taken place.<br />\nThe I.F.C.'s action in this case can only<br />\nhave detrimental effects upon the fraternity<br />\nsystem. By dealing with Phi Psi in the manner in which it did, it has demonstrated a<br />\ncomplete lack of responsibility. Little regard<br />\nwas given to the Brothers who have been under<br />\nsocial probation for a semester. And little regard was given to the serious consequences<br />\nwhich may follow an action which threw away<br />\nall semblance of judicious and responsible<br />\npractice to study the first significant problem<br />\never before the I.F.C. The fraternity system at<br />\nHopkins suffered a serious setback when the<br />\nI.F.C., in essence, allowed personal bias and<br />\nhearsay to govern its function as a deliberative<br />\nand judicial (i.e. rational and just) body.<br /><br />\nPAID ADVERTISEMENT<br /><br />\nCASH<br />\nFOR YOUR<br /><br />\nBOOKS<br />\nThursday, January 27, 1966<br />\nAND<br /><br />\nFriday, January 28, 1955<br />\nUsed Books will be bought by the<br />\nBooksfore on the above dates,<br />\nfrom 9:00 A.M. to 4:30 P.M.

JANUARY 21, 1966<br /><br />\nREPUBLICAN BIAS<br /><br />\nBlock Repeal Of 14b!!<br />\nBy GEOFFREY LEBAR<br />\nThe recent mass transit strike<br />\nin New York City does not prove<br />\nthat section 14b of the TaftHartley Act should be repealed.<br />\nAlthough it seems that such a<br />\ndramatic strike will affect the<br />\nrepeal. The labor problem should<br />\nbe considered on its merits.<br />\nThe Republican minority in<br />\nthe last session of Congress was<br />\nable to block the repeal of the<br />\n\"right to work law\" mainly because it offered a positive program to control the abuses of<br />\nlabor. The repeal of section 14b<br />\nIs only symbolic. It affects only<br />\n19 of the least industrial states.<br />\nBut the two major Republican<br />\ndemands on labor would have a<br />\nrevolutionary effect. RepubliCCM propose: I) to eliminate<br />\nall types of racial discrimination<br />\nfrom unions and 2) to provide<br /><br />\nstiff penalities for unions using<br />\nmembership dues to aid specific<br />\npolitical candidates.<br />\nThis second provision would<br />\nnot outlaw general money grants<br />\nto the parties. Of course, the<br />\nDemocrats will claim that big<br />\nbusiness serves the Republican<br />\ncoffers, and therefore labor<br />\nshould serve the Democrats<br />\nsimilarly. But that just is not so.<br />\nContributions made in the name<br />\nof big corporations like Johnson<br />\nand Johnson, Dupont, General<br />\nMotors, etc., were made in equal<br />\namounts to each political party<br />\nduring the recent campaigns. It<br />\nmay be true that certain business executives contribute to the<br />\nRepublican party. But they do<br />\nnot contribute company money.<br />\nUnion leaders may contribute to<br />\nthe Democratic party, but they<br /><br />\nshoud not use membership dues.<br />\nLabor unions have a good<br />\nrecord on civil rights on paper,<br />\nbut their membership lists are<br />\noften lilly white. At the recent<br />\nnational AFL-CIO convention at<br />\nSan Francisco, a newsman<br />\ncounted only 20 negro delegates<br />\nout of a total of 922, and most<br />\nof them came from N.Y.C.<br /><br />\nber 20, 1964 on criminal charges<br />\nof depriving a Negro laborer of<br />\nemployment opportunity. They<br />\nwere accused of conspiracy and<br />\n\"discrimination against a Negro<br />\nworking man by depriving him<br />\nbecause of his raoe and color<br />\nof his civil rights to obtain employment.\"<br />\nThis case was the first criminal<br />\nprosecution attempted under N.Y.<br />\nState's anti-discrimination laws,<br />\nOn July 16, 1963, Barry Goldwater, of all people, introduced<br />\nan amendment to the Civil<br />\nRights Act of 1964 which would<br />\nhave outlawed labor union racial<br />\ndiscrimination. It was defeated<br />\nby the Democratic majority on<br />\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.<br /><br />\nhearings on the Civil Rights Bill,<br />\nand said he agreed \"in principle\"<br />\nwith the amendment proposed by<br />\nSenator Goldwater which \"would<br />\ndeny certification to labor unions<br />\nrefusing membership because of<br />\nrace.\"<br />\nWhile the unions were discouraging civil rights legislation,<br />\nthe<br />\nRepublican<br />\nconservative<br />\nsenator from Texas, John Tower<br />\nwas doing something for civil<br />\nrights. On October 1, 1963,<br />\nTower voted to extend the life<br />\nof the Civil Rights Commission<br />\nfor another year. The vote was<br />\n70-15; all 15 negative votes were<br />\ncast by southern Democrats.<br /><br />\nThe New York State Commission for Human Rights ruled on<br />\nMarch 4, 1964 that Local 28 of<br />\nthe Sheet Metal Workers International Association has \"automatically<br />\nexcluded\"<br />\nNegroes<br />\nfrom membership throughout<br />\nthe union's 76 year history.<br />\nThomas P. McLinskey, ex-business agent of Steamlitters Local<br />\nOn August 14, 1963, John<br />\n638, and Jules Shurkman, a New<br />\nTwo days later on July 18,<br />\nYork lawyer, were indicted by a 1963, Willard Wirtz testified at Tower and Jacob Javits coN.Y. County grand jury Novem- Senate Commerce Committee sponsored an anti-discrimination rider to the Domestic Peace<br />\nCorps bill. It was defeated 49-41<br />\nwith a large majority of the<br />\nnegative votes being cast by<br />\nDemocrats not necessarily from<br />\nthe South. Senator Tower voted<br />\nagainst the Civil Rights Bill in<br />\n1964 and now is said to regret it.<br />\nHe will introduce civil rights<br />\nlegislation again to alter any<br />\nsegregationist image he may<br />\nhave acquired.<br />\nThe whole point of this discussion is not to condemn labor<br />\nunions or glorify Goldwater and<br />\nTower's record. Neither is great,<br />\nand both will be better in the<br />\nfuture. But at least Republicans<br />\ncan take credit for honestly<br />\nacknowledging the problem of<br />\ndiscrimination where it actually<br />\nexists outside of the South.

This represents 18% of<br />\nthe undergraduate body. This<br />\nmeans 67.9% of those voting did<br />\nnot agree with the administration policy. The mandate defeated its purpose and now we<br />\ncan rightfully be branded as<br />\nmilitarists with a smattering of<br />\npacifists among us. We just cannot win.<br />\nBut we digress. We take issue<br />\nwith the prerogative of the<br />\nCouncil to violate the confidence<br />\nof the student body. We would<br />\nbet guns to butter that those<br />\nwho thundered \"show the world<br />\nwhere we stand\" would have<br />\nbeen silent as church mice had<br />\nthe vote been for pulling out of<br />\nVietnam. The motion would<br />\nnever have reached the floor.<br />\nThe comment was made in<br />\nCouncil that SDS would have<br />\nexploited the news; but no matter what the outcome it would<br />\nhave been announced in the<br />\nNews-Letter--and rightfully so.<br />\nWhy the publicity? Surely, it<br />\nIs of little consequence that 18%<br />\nHopkins'<br />\nundergraduates<br />\nof<br />\nvoted to support administration<br />\nVietnam policy. We submit that<br />\nsuch figures are unlikely to convince the Baltimore community<br />\nthat its impression of Homewood<br />\nas a focal point for anti-war<br />\nsentiment is incorrect; in fact<br />\nthat impression, fostered by unfavorable and injudicious newspaper coverage in October, has<br />\nundoubtedly dissipated. Hence,<br />\nCouncil action will serve only to<br />\nrevive local antagonism, yet will<br />\nnot lessen it.<br />\nFurther, it seems to us that<br />\nthe Council has proceeded with<br />\nundue haste on one count, yet<br />\nsuffers from \"over-inertia\" on<br />\nanother. Why, we wonder, did<br />\nthe Council presume knowledge<br />\nof Baltimore opinion, yet feel<br />\nconstrained to sample Hopkins'<br /><br />\nfeelings before making a definitive judgement similar to that<br />\nit had already made about the<br />\nsurrounding<br />\ncommunity?<br />\nIt<br />\nseems reasonable to expect that<br />\nthe Student Council, an official<br />\norganization of The Johns Hopkins University, would feel more<br />\ncompetent to make a priori<br />\njudgements about campus opinion. (This, in fact, was done<br />\nonly implicitly in that it was obvious that most Council members assumed that student opinion would prove to favor administration policy in Vietnam). In<br />\nlight of the foregoing the logical<br />\nand truly honest extension of<br />\nthe Council's motives and intent<br />\nwould have been to first conduct<br />\na poll of the entire Baltimore<br />\ncommunity to see whether, in<br />\nfact, Baltimore did view Hopkins in the manner the Council<br />\nso blithely assumed it did.<br />\nAdmittedly, several of our<br />\ncomments may border on the<br />\nfacetious. Setting them aside, we<br />\nfeel that the Council's action<br />\nwas a grave mistake. Shelley<br />\nEarp is to be commended for<br />\ncasting the decisive ballot which<br />\nensured that the poll's results<br />\nwould not be sent to President<br />\nJohnson\u2014that would have multiplied the error. It is unfortunate that his refusal to conceive<br />\nof the poll as a \"mandate\" did<br />\nnot persuade the Council. Finally, we note that 46% of Hopkins' undergraduates saw fit not<br />\nto participate in the poll. Such<br />\ninaction led directly to the<br />\nquandry in which we are now<br />\ninvolved.
