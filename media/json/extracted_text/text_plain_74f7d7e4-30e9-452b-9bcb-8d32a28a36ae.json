We know that we are giving out a bit<br />\nof stale news; everybody knows about the game, but that is not<br />\nthe point. The real question is \"What are we going to do<br />\nabout it?\"<br />\nFor over a month the squad has been working daily, anc:<br />\nit looks already as if the results are the same as they have been<br />\nin the past. Handicapped as usual with limited material, Coach<br />\nVan Orman and his assistants are building up another of the<br />\nteams with the well known Hopkins fight, equal to any team in<br />\ntheir class, and ready to give much stronger opponents a run<br />\nfor their money.<br />\nHaverford is almost an ideal opponent for the Jay eleven<br />\nto tackle at this time. The two are evenly matched. The Pennsylvanians always come down with a 'scrappy team and a large<br />\ncrowd of followers, for Haverford would rather beat Hopkins<br />\nin football than have ice cream for dinner every day for a year.<br />\nIn fact, there is nothing they enjoy more, as those of us who<br />\nsaw their 6-0 victory last fall can testify.

We know that we are giving out a bit<br />\nof stale news; everybody knows about the game, but that is not<br />\nthe point. The real question is \"What are we going to do<br />\nabout it?\"<br />\nFor over a month the squad has been working daily, anc:<br />\nit looks already as if the results are the same as they have been<br />\nin the past. Handicapped as usual with limited material, Coach<br />\nVan Orman and his assistants are building up another of the<br />\nteams with the well known Hopkins fight, equal to any team in<br />\ntheir class, and ready to give much stronger opponents a run<br />\nfor their money.<br />\nHaverford is almost an ideal opponent for the Jay eleven<br />\nto tackle at this time. The two are evenly matched. The Pennsylvanians always come down with a 'scrappy team and a large<br />\ncrowd of followers, for Haverford would rather beat Hopkins<br />\nin football than have ice cream for dinner every day for a year.<br />\nIn fact, there is nothing they enjoy more, as those of us who<br />\nsaw their 6-0 victory last fall can testify. That defeat of las;t<br />\nyear is the last straw\u2014we've got to beat Haverford.<br />\nAs we said just a Minute ago, the squad has worked hard.<br />\nnearly everybody knows what that means, and those that<br />\ndon't ought to go out to the field a few afternoons and see.<br />\nOver two hours routine signal practice, back breaking exercises, or hard scrimmage every day.
