The worthy dean, who was himself a keen sportsman in his<br />\nyounger days, said, \"Wherever we go discussions turn primarily on<br />\nthe results of the cricket matches and dirt-track races.\" The situation<br />\nin this country is not as bad as it is in England. Generally speaking,<br />\nthe American is not as sport-minded as the Englishman.<br />\nHowever, in our own American universities this over-interest in<br />\nsport is prevalent. The great majority of students assume the roles<br />\nof observer, statistician and prophet instead of deriving the actual<br />\nphysical benefit from the sports. This is due to the fact that our<br />\nathletic directors are more interested in the development of star players<br />\nand snappily functioning machines than in the physical development<br />\nof the majority of the student body. The percentage of actual participants in the athletics of any university is extremely small.<br />\nMajor sports in the colleges are too spectacular. Every fall we become football crazy. Thousands of students and others pack stadiums<br />\nall over the country to sit huddled and shivering on hard benches in<br />\norder to watch a group of performers give themselves a workout.<br />\nEach play is discussed; figures from past generations are brought into<br />\nview. Here at the Hopkins, however, we are glad to note that this<br />\nsituation is not carried out to the extent that it is at other so-called<br />\ninstitutions of learning.<br />\nThe average college man has a great amount of leisure. How he<br />\nspends this leisure time will tell just what he gets out of his college<br />\nlife. There are numerous ways of putting this additional time to good<br />\nuse. Too little of it is spent in travel, which is the most broadening<br />\nof all educational pursuits. The average student does not devote much<br />\ntime to reading, outside of that which is required. Far too little consideration is given to the arts, and yet the college man is supposed to<br />\nreflect culture. And then, far too little time outside of the classroom<br />\nis given to contacts with professors.<br />\nMore attention at the Hopkins should be given to the physical development of the individual. A student needs a certain amount of<br />\nexercise in order to have a clear mind for his studies. A lack of<br />\nregular exercise leads to sluggishness in mental habits. It is needless<br />\nto say that this factor is sadly neglected by many students.<br />\nThe appearance of a cage on the campus would be the best solution<br />\nS.

The worthy dean, who was himself a keen sportsman in his<br />\nyounger days, said, \"Wherever we go discussions turn primarily on<br />\nthe results of the cricket matches and dirt-track races.\" The situation<br />\nin this country is not as bad as it is in England. Generally speaking,<br />\nthe American is not as sport-minded as the Englishman.<br />\nHowever, in our own American universities this over-interest in<br />\nsport is prevalent. The great majority of students assume the roles<br />\nof observer, statistician and prophet instead of deriving the actual<br />\nphysical benefit from the sports. This is due to the fact that our<br />\nathletic directors are more interested in the development of star players<br />\nand snappily functioning machines than in the physical development<br />\nof the majority of the student body. The percentage of actual participants in the athletics of any university is extremely small.<br />\nMajor sports in the colleges are too spectacular. Every fall we become football crazy. Thousands of students and others pack stadiums<br />\nall over the country to sit huddled and shivering on hard benches in<br />\norder to watch a group of performers give themselves a workout.<br />\nEach play is discussed; figures from past generations are brought into<br />\nview. Here at the Hopkins, however, we are glad to note that this<br />\nsituation is not carried out to the extent that it is at other so-called<br />\ninstitutions of learning.<br />\nThe average college man has a great amount of leisure. How he<br />\nspends this leisure time will tell just what he gets out of his college<br />\nlife. There are numerous ways of putting this additional time to good<br />\nuse. Too little of it is spent in travel, which is the most broadening<br />\nof all educational pursuits. The average student does not devote much<br />\ntime to reading, outside of that which is required. Far too little consideration is given to the arts, and yet the college man is supposed to<br />\nreflect culture. And then, far too little time outside of the classroom<br />\nis given to contacts with professors.<br />\nMore attention at the Hopkins should be given to the physical development of the individual. A student needs a certain amount of<br />\nexercise in order to have a clear mind for his studies. A lack of<br />\nregular exercise leads to sluggishness in mental habits. It is needless<br />\nto say that this factor is sadly neglected by many students.<br />\nThe appearance of a cage on the campus would be the best solution<br />\nS.
