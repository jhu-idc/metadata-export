Oh, the<br />\nstudents. I never think of the students!\"<br />\nThe university treasurer's report, released this week, though<br />\nhardly comprehensible to us, does reveal some trends worth consideration. Most important to students on the Homewood campus<br />\nperhaps, is that the total income from tuition in the faculty<br />\nof philosophy and the school of engineering for the year ended<br />\nJune 30, 1954, was $1,896,635 while expenditures in the same<br />\nbranches of the university totaled $7,619,813. This shows in crude<br />\nterms almost a four to one return on tuition paid by students.<br />\nAbove figures may be compared with the income from tuition<br />\nat the medical school, $244,901\u2014and a total expenditure of<br />\n$3,739,004. While the crude return on investment of tuition at<br />\nHomewood is almost four to one, at the school of medicine it is<br />\n15 to one. This tremendous difference is explained by the<br />\ndifference in amount of endowment income ($349,509 for Homewood, $780,496 for the medical school) and the difference in<br />\nrestricted gifts ($347,227 for Homewood, $1,638,845 for the medical school). The total funds available to the medical school from<br />\nthese sources is $2,429,341 while Homewood takes in only $696,736.<br />\nPresident Reed's Comlnemoration Day ad.dress last year gave<br />\nthe students little cause for reassurance that they had not been<br />\nforgotten. Most of his speech was devoted to a description of the<br />\nwork carried on by various branches of the University. He seemed<br />\nparticularly interested in the Apecial research being carried on\u2014<br />\nespecially under government contract. While the right and duty<br />\nof the university to do this work was never questioned by us, we<br />\nwere afraid that the ideal of a \"research institution\" might be<br />\nrealized at a cost to the student.<br />\n.It was therefore with considerable relief that we noted the<br />\ncomments of several members of the administration in regard to<br />\nthe Treasurer's Report. President Reed said, \"A study of the<br />\nreport indietates that reStrieted funds for specific projects are<br />\nmore readily available, than are funds for the basic university<br />\ndepartments which by their excellence attract these special pro/ jects. We hope all elements of society join us to reverse this trend,<br />\nto return to greater support for basic educational departments.\"<br />\nCarlyle Barton, president of the Board of Trustees, in a<br />\nstatement on the treasurer's report supported this position further,<br />\n\"The university's distinguished record in training men for<br />\nbusiness and industrial careers, its accomplishments in original<br />\nresearch, and its unique function of training those who often form<br />\nthe core of other faculties and the research of industry cannot<br />\nbe allowed to decline through any interruption of this huge<br />\nvolume of 'special purpose funds.' However, the heart of the<br />\nuniversity is its basic departments and 'their teachers and<br />\nscholars supported from general funds. We are striving to maintain a realistic balance between the resources of these basic<br />\nelements of the university and those of the specialized activities<br />\nit has been asked to undertake by industry, government and<br />\nfoundation.\"<br />\nCognizance of the problem is by no means its solution. Certainly if what Mr. Barton' calls the \"basic elements of the university\" are to continue developing they shall need an ever<br />\nincreasing amount of capital with which to do this.<br />\n<br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, October 15, 1954<br />\n<br />\nShriver's Testament Termed<br />\n\"One Of Most Curious Writings\"<br />\nOn June 7, 1937, while under\"Startling!\" \"Beneath the diggoing surgical treatment at the nity of the university to accept<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital, Alfred such a grant!\" \"The Duchess of<br />\nWindsor was omitted from the<br />\nJenkins Shriver wrote his Will.<br />\nlist\" \"Now, if you would have<br />\nHe never quite recovered from asked me to name the ten\u2014\".

Oh, the<br />\nstudents. I never think of the students!\"<br />\nThe university treasurer's report, released this week, though<br />\nhardly comprehensible to us, does reveal some trends worth consideration. Most important to students on the Homewood campus<br />\nperhaps, is that the total income from tuition in the faculty<br />\nof philosophy and the school of engineering for the year ended<br />\nJune 30, 1954, was $1,896,635 while expenditures in the same<br />\nbranches of the university totaled $7,619,813. This shows in crude<br />\nterms almost a four to one return on tuition paid by students.<br />\nAbove figures may be compared with the income from tuition<br />\nat the medical school, $244,901\u2014and a total expenditure of<br />\n$3,739,004. While the crude return on investment of tuition at<br />\nHomewood is almost four to one, at the school of medicine it is<br />\n15 to one. This tremendous difference is explained by the<br />\ndifference in amount of endowment income ($349,509 for Homewood, $780,496 for the medical school) and the difference in<br />\nrestricted gifts ($347,227 for Homewood, $1,638,845 for the medical school). The total funds available to the medical school from<br />\nthese sources is $2,429,341 while Homewood takes in only $696,736.<br />\nPresident Reed's Comlnemoration Day ad.dress last year gave<br />\nthe students little cause for reassurance that they had not been<br />\nforgotten. Most of his speech was devoted to a description of the<br />\nwork carried on by various branches of the University. He seemed<br />\nparticularly interested in the Apecial research being carried on\u2014<br />\nespecially under government contract. While the right and duty<br />\nof the university to do this work was never questioned by us, we<br />\nwere afraid that the ideal of a \"research institution\" might be<br />\nrealized at a cost to the student.<br />\n.It was therefore with considerable relief that we noted the<br />\ncomments of several members of the administration in regard to<br />\nthe Treasurer's Report. President Reed said, \"A study of the<br />\nreport indietates that reStrieted funds for specific projects are<br />\nmore readily available, than are funds for the basic university<br />\ndepartments which by their excellence attract these special pro/ jects. We hope all elements of society join us to reverse this trend,<br />\nto return to greater support for basic educational departments.\"<br />\nCarlyle Barton, president of the Board of Trustees, in a<br />\nstatement on the treasurer's report supported this position further,<br />\n\"The university's distinguished record in training men for<br />\nbusiness and industrial careers, its accomplishments in original<br />\nresearch, and its unique function of training those who often form<br />\nthe core of other faculties and the research of industry cannot<br />\nbe allowed to decline through any interruption of this huge<br />\nvolume of 'special purpose funds.' However, the heart of the<br />\nuniversity is its basic departments and 'their teachers and<br />\nscholars supported from general funds. We are striving to maintain a realistic balance between the resources of these basic<br />\nelements of the university and those of the specialized activities<br />\nit has been asked to undertake by industry, government and<br />\nfoundation.\"<br />\nCognizance of the problem is by no means its solution. Certainly if what Mr. Barton' calls the \"basic elements of the university\" are to continue developing they shall need an ever<br />\nincreasing amount of capital with which to do this.<br /><br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, October 15, 1954<br /><br />\nShriver's Testament Termed<br />\n\"One Of Most Curious Writings\"<br />\nOn June 7, 1937, while under\"Startling!\" \"Beneath the diggoing surgical treatment at the nity of the university to accept<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital, Alfred such a grant!\" \"The Duchess of<br />\nWindsor was omitted from the<br />\nJenkins Shriver wrote his Will.<br />\nlist\" \"Now, if you would have<br />\nHe never quite recovered from asked me to name the ten\u2014\".
