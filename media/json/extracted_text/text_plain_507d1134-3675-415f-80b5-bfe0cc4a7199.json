While we, in SDS share in appreciation for our lives as University students, and<br />\nwhile we don't necessarily disparage career<br />\naspirations, we feel that prevalent views of the<br />\nrelationship between th student and his activities in the University contain assumptions<br />\nwhich, unless challenged, would limit the extent to which our lives could he rich and meaningful.\"<br />\nClearly, the tnessage confronts die Freshmen with<br />\nthe thesis that going to college is second place to fighting the real world and its ills. It suggests that the University itself is liable to criticism, and that as long as<br />\nwe're here, our lives could be richer by attacking the<br />\nlocal wrongs.<br />\nThere are others, on the contrary, who dote on<br />\nthe necessity of morality and legality within the campus<br />\ncommunity; a community not really noted for its cohesion nor even for being a community.<br />\n\"We,\" say the Student Council,\"act as the ruling body over all campus organizations so as<br />\nto keep the entire extra-curricular program<br />\nrunning smoothly. We, of course are the main<br />\nline of communication between the students<br />\nand faculty as shown by the Student Faculty<br />\nForum run under the Council auspices each<br />\nfall.\"<br />\nAnd \"we,\" say the Honor Commission, give<br />\nyou an Honor System which is \"a way of life.\"<br />\nIt applies to every action of the individual.<br />\nIt is something not imposed from without but<br />\nrealized within. Living under the Honor System cannot leave an individual unchanged.<br />\n\"Students must live up to the Honor System<br />\nas well as live under it. To fail is to fail oneself<br />\nand the community, as well as to break with a<br />\nlong and noble tradition.\"<br />\nWe are all in truth, whether dissenter or co-joiner,<br />\nwhether we play lacrosse or play with our professors,<br />\nwe are all clients of a cash-and-carry educational supplies dispensary. The Johns Hopkins faculty to student<br />\nrelationship is truly a business relationship, an objective,<br />\nsomewhat detached market place for items of destiny.<br />\nAnd for this reason, this relationship ranges from attendant to pedant to agitant to militant and so on.<br />\nWhat is so nice is that students attend this University on such a 1)&4864 and are masters of themselves<br />\nsuch that they are considered capable of purchasing a<br />\ndecent destiny.<br />\nNo doubt some of the \"client students\" are poor<br />\nshoppers, some ought send their mothers to shop for<br />\nthem, and some are in the store merely to get out of<br />\nthe rain. And it is bewildering and almost imperfect that<br />\na University contains this diversity; not only contains it<br />\nbut incorporates it.

Yet it would be difficult<br />\nto include her among the Seven<br />\nSisters on the basis of name<br />\n<br />\nalone. Among Vassar, Bryn<br />\nMawr and, Mount Holyoke it is<br />\ndifficult to imagine a college<br />\nthat appears to be named for<br />\nthe most prominent of the Marx<br />\nBrothers.<br />\nTen percent of all girls at<br />\nGoucher confine their dating to<br />\na bunch of horses that are<br />\nstabled behind the tennis courts.<br />\nThey take consolation in the<br />\nfact that they are, in conscious<br />\nseven sister image-building, allowed to wear their jodphers to<br />\nclass while shorts are forbidden.<br />\nAnother ten percent spends its<br />\nweekends among those light<br />\nwooded areas and secluded glens<br />\ndaintily sipping from a List,erine<br />\nbottle filled with Cutty Sark.<br />\nThe remainder date in patterns<br />\n<br />\nIt is hoped that Hopkins will<br />\nexploit a newly acquired time<br />\nadvantage that leaves Goucher<br />\ncooling its high heels for a week<br />\nor so before we get ready.

His<br />\ninterpretation of a Vivaldi sonata highlighted his dexterity in<br />\nthe inventive skill.<br />\nWith great smoothness and<br />\n<br />\ncontrol he showed a general<br />\ninventiveness of form that is a<br />\nclear bid for a position in serious modern music; it is also<br />\na bid for the guitar in serious<br />\nmodern composition.<br />\nAltogether this concert was<br />\nCharlie Byrd's statement of his<br />\ninstrument. He played jazz,<br />\nbaroque and classical work, and<br />\nstill produced charming melodic<br />\npassages. Yet he showed more expression and control than mere<br />\ntour de force, and more vivacity<br />\nthan mere scholarship.

While we, in SDS share in appreciation for our lives as University students, and<br />\nwhile we don't necessarily disparage career<br />\naspirations, we feel that prevalent views of the<br />\nrelationship between th student and his activities in the University contain assumptions<br />\nwhich, unless challenged, would limit the extent to which our lives could he rich and meaningful.\"<br />\nClearly, the tnessage confronts die Freshmen with<br />\nthe thesis that going to college is second place to fighting the real world and its ills. It suggests that the University itself is liable to criticism, and that as long as<br />\nwe're here, our lives could be richer by attacking the<br />\nlocal wrongs.<br />\nThere are others, on the contrary, who dote on<br />\nthe necessity of morality and legality within the campus<br />\ncommunity; a community not really noted for its cohesion nor even for being a community.<br />\n\"We,\" say the Student Council,\"act as the ruling body over all campus organizations so as<br />\nto keep the entire extra-curricular program<br />\nrunning smoothly. We, of course are the main<br />\nline of communication between the students<br />\nand faculty as shown by the Student Faculty<br />\nForum run under the Council auspices each<br />\nfall.\"<br />\nAnd \"we,\" say the Honor Commission, give<br />\nyou an Honor System which is \"a way of life.\"<br />\nIt applies to every action of the individual.<br />\nIt is something not imposed from without but<br />\nrealized within.

To fail is to fail oneself<br />\nand the community, as well as to break with a<br />\nlong and noble tradition.\"<br />\nWe are all in truth, whether dissenter or co-joiner,<br />\nwhether we play lacrosse or play with our professors,<br />\nwe are all clients of a cash-and-carry educational supplies dispensary. The Johns Hopkins faculty to student<br />\nrelationship is truly a business relationship, an objective,<br />\nsomewhat detached market place for items of destiny.<br />\nAnd for this reason, this relationship ranges from attendant to pedant to agitant to militant and so on.<br />\nWhat is so nice is that students attend this University on such a 1)&amp;4864 and are masters of themselves<br />\nsuch that they are considered capable of purchasing a<br />\ndecent destiny.<br />\nNo doubt some of the \"client students\" are poor<br />\nshoppers, some ought send their mothers to shop for<br />\nthem, and some are in the store merely to get out of<br />\nthe rain.
