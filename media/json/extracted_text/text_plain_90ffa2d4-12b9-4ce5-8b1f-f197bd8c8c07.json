Of course, the fight<br />\nagainst war is too pressing<br />\nto be confined to occasional<br />\npieces. At a time when the world is just as close to the<br />\nabyss as it was in 1913, we had best put our faith in<br />\nspecific peace programs rather than lengthy polemics<br />\nagainst war as an instrument of national policy.<br />\nDuring the coming week-end two peace conferences<br />\nwill be held in Baltimore. The first of these is under<br />\nthe auspices of the Maryland Peace Conference, the<br />\nsecond under those of the Keep Amreica Out of War<br />\nCongress. Both deserve the fullest support of all friends<br />\nof peace and democracy.<br />\nAt this moment, however, we are, as true provincials, chiefly interested in the future of the peace movement on the Hopkins campus. Last spring there was set<br />\nup at the University a permanent peace committee designed, to carry out the work of last year's anti-war<br />\nstrike.<br />\nWe had hoped for much from this organization.<br />\nFor there is much to be done. We are all of us confused<br />\nabout the future of America's foreign policy. The peace<br />\ncommittee was expected to provide a series of lectures<br />\nand discussions led by various authorities on that subject. It was expected to plan a genuine anti-war program and to carry out that program in vigorous fashion.<br />\nUnfortunately this has not been the case. Our strictures against the peace committee as now contsituted<br />\nare too well-known to bear repetition here. In the face<br />\nof events which have rocked the peace of Europe, it has<br />\nremained quiescent.<br />\nThe city-wide week-end peace conference should<br />\nbe an impetus to better things. Out of them should<br />\ncome a program of definite action for the Hopkins.

However, the first issue<br />\nof the magazine can hardly be called<br />\na Hopkins periodical, for all its contained pertaining to the University<br />\nwas a snapshot or two of the<br />\ncampus. On the whole it was filled<br />\nwith \"stuff\" that smelled to high<br />\nheaven, and which was evidently<br />\nwritten by the printer who published<br />\nthe magazine because of the ads secured by last year's staff.<br />\nThere's a rumor that the advertising agency cancelled the contract<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nafter consulting Dean Berry and<br />\nlearning of the status of the publication. However, the printers went<br />\nright ahead in spite of this and put<br />\nthe edition out, and at the present<br />\ntime are worrying like h\u2014 about<br />\ntheir money.<br />\nWe've always favored a literary<br />\nmagazine on the campus, and felt<br />\nthat the administration made a mistake in purging it, but to say that<br />\nwe approve of the tripe handed out<br />\nin the October copy would be hypocritical.

Again on the next play,<br />\nMcCord plunged through center for<br />\nthe first score. The Babs were in possession of the ball the greater part of<br />\nthe first quarter. In the second<br />\nquarter the Playboys continued their<br />\nfine playing. This time they went<br />\ninto the air. On a series of short<br />\npasses over the center, the Babs<br />\nscored again, this time the ball was<br />\ncarried by Schwartzman. When the<br />\nBab Playboys relaxed for a few<br />\nminutes, the Soph Bus pushed over<br />\na touchdown. Felu on a pass from<br />\nMenche carried the ball over for the<br />\ntouchdown. Irritated since they were<br />\nscored upon, the Playboys came back<br />\nwith two touchdowns in quick succession. McCard and Schwartzman<br />\nagain scoring 6 points apiece.

Unable to<br />\nsolve the Engineers offensive tactics,<br />\nthe Frosh were helpless. Again<br />\nPech carried the ball over on an end<br />\nrun. In the second half the Senior<br />\ncontinued their scoring. This time<br />\nJarman scored twice, once on a long<br />\npass and the other on a center<br />\nplunge.

Here Swarthmore's defense<br />\nstiffened and the Jays were compelled to kick, Spilman taking the<br />\nhonors. Hartman took Spilman's<br />\nkick on his 15 and immediately<br />\nfumbled the ball, where upon<br />\nMilligan recovered for Hopkins on<br />\nthe Garnet's yard stripe.<br />\nOn the next play Hopkins was penalized 15 yards for holding, but Spilman on a forward pass to Milligan<br />\nmade up the lost ground. At this<br />\npoint the Swarthmore line stiffened<br />\nand Hopkins lost the ball on downs.<br />\nHartman, stellar punter for Swarthmore, kicked out to his 45. For the<br />\n<br />\nquarter, Hopkins, again took the of-<br />\n<br />\nreceive.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins<br />\n<br />\nfensive and in a few plays was deep<br />\nin Swarthmore territory. Rudo and<br />\nKerstetter ran through the Garnet<br />\nline making steady gains, but the<br />\nJays failed to make the gains when<br />\nthey<br />\n<br />\nwere<br />\n<br />\nneeded<br />\n<br />\nmost. The<br />\n<br />\nre-<br />\n<br />\nmainder of the period saw the ball<br />\nsee-saw back and forth due to the<br />\nfine spiral punting of Spilman and<br />\nHartman, of Hopkins and Swarthmore respectively.<br />\nWith the resumption of play in the<br />\nfourth quarter, Hopkins began to<br />\ndisplay an aggressive drive and<br />\nreally gave the Swarthmore eleven<br />\ntwo real spares.<br />\n<br />\nSportlight<br />\nEdgar Spilman<br />\n<br />\nContinuing their high gear attack against Delta Phi, Pi Lam<br />\nhanded them their first defeat in no<br />\nsmall fashion as they piled up a 38-2<br />\nmargin of victory.

Empiricism, the method of the completely<br />\nsensory world trusts only to the<br />\nprinciple of observation. Memory is<br />\nour means of seeking truth from the<br />\npast, but results in \"reactionism and<br />\nstagnation.\" The world of verbal abstraction, that of the logician and<br />\nphilosopher is another means of<br />\nfinding truth, but it inevitably leads<br />\nto skepticism.<br />\nLastly, we have the method of the<br />\nmystic, pure religion; the mystic<br />\n<br />\nwho believes \"thus saith the Lord.\"<br />\n\"Can't we combine all four of these<br />\nmethods of finding truth? The world<br />\ntoday needs faith. But it also needs<br />\ncooperativeness and integrity\", said<br />\nDr Hart.<br />\n\"We could obtain these three conditions, if science and religion were<br />\nunited in the fundamental law of the<br />\nuniverse, brotherhood.

We are all of us confused<br />\nabout the future of America's foreign policy.

It was expected to plan a genuine anti-war program and to carry out that program in vigorous fashion.<br />\nUnfortunately this has not been the case. Our strictures against the peace committee as now contsituted<br />\nare too well-known to bear repetition here. In the face<br />\nof events which have rocked the peace of Europe, it has<br />\nremained quiescent.<br />\nThe city-wide week-end peace conference should<br />\nbe an impetus to better things.
