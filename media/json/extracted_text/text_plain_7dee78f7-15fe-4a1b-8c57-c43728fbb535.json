It is good<br />\nthat the Council has seen fit to enlighten the student body<br />\non its work; it is courageous that they have done so in<br />\nyieNv of the lack of real accomplishment shown therein.<br />\nHow the writer of the report can blithely remark that<br />\n\"the major accomplishment of the Council was the sponsorship of the Student-Faculty Camp\" when it is a wellknown fact that much of the work of organization of the<br />\ncamp was completed prior to their taking office, we can't<br />\nunderstand. Similarly, we find nothing to indicate that<br />\nthe \"Council has shown marked interest in the race problem.\" It hasn't been mentioned since last spring.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that \"after a poor start due<br />\nto personnel difficulties, the SC Assembly Conference<br />\nCommittee is now functioning smoothly.\" Our only question: Where are assemblies?<br />\nOther matters mentioned by the report are steps forward (additional members on the Goucher-Hopkins Coordination Committee; expanding the activities of the Public Relations Committee) but these are small steps forward<br />\nin view of what the Council could do and has not done.<br />\nWhat the Council omits from the report is that topic<br />\nabout which most of its meetings have revolved this<br />\nsemester: the SAC-SC relationship\u2014a problem which,<br />\nas of now, has yet to be solved.<br />\nWhatever the case, the Council has failed to come<br />\nup with new ideas, to provide speakers for assemblies,<br />\nand, worst of all, has failed to settle the contradictions<br />\nwithin its own house.

Steinwald<br />\n<br />\nMusic In The Air<br />\n<br />\nConcert Series Well Received<br />\nBy MARK PEREL<br />\nOn January 15 the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony Orchestra under the<br />\ndirection of Peter Herman Adler presented the first in a<br />\nseries of two concerts in Shriver<br />\nHall. There has been cause in<br />\nthe past to say many unkind<br />\nthings about the orchestra's<br />\nconcerts, but if we are to judge<br />\nby Sunday's performance we<br />\nmust now recognize the astonishing improvement which Dr.<br />\nAdler has wrought in the orchestra. They play the notes<br />\ncorrectly, they play together,<br />\nand often they display considerable dynamic subtlety. Sunday's<br />\nprogram was, consequently, an<br />\nenjoyable experience.<br />\nMaestro Adler began the program with the Beethoven Third<br />\nSymphony (\"Eroica\"). It was<br />\ngiven a highly dramatic but<br />\nuneccentric reading by the conductor, notable for its taut control and the orchestra's exemplary ensemble playing. The<br />\nfirst movement was flexible in<br />\n<br />\nwith finely<br />\ndynamic range<br />\nstressed orchestral clarity. If<br />\nthe great slow movement did<br />\nnot probe the depths of the<br />\nsoul, it did move along with<br />\ngreat dignity, the conductor resisting the temptation to linger<br />\nover and unnecessarily sentimentalize phrases. A bouyant<br />\nScherzo featuring fine woodwind<br />\nplaying and great verve was<br />\neven more enhanced by facile<br />\nplaying of the tricky French<br />\nhorn passages in the trio. Dr.<br />\nAdler interpreted the fourth<br />\nmovement, marked Allegro molto<br />\nvery literally, and thus began<br />\nat quite a fast clip. It was extremely satisfying to see, however, that things never got out<br />\nof hand interpretively, nor did<br />\nthe orchestra seem pushed beyond its capabilities. In sum,<br />\nDr. Adler told us nothing<br />\nthe<br />\nabout<br />\nnew<br />\nstartlingly<br />\n\"Eroica,\" but presented credible and musicianly ideas, his<br />\norchestra communicating them<br />\nwith utmost subtlety.<br />\nDvorak's short but masterful<br />\n<br />\nScherzo Capriccios\u00b0, Op. 66 followed the intermission. Suffice<br />\nit to say that here again the<br />\norchestra displayed itself to best<br />\nadvantage, playing very well<br />\nindeed. The reading was, however, somewhat staid and too<br />\nevenly regulated for the alternating moods of impetuosity<br />\nand waltzing lyricism. A bit<br />\nless careful control by the conductor would have allowed some<br />\nof the abandon of Dvorak's<br />\ntemperament to infect the audience to a greater degree.<br />\nThe program concluded with<br />\nthe playing of the Schumann<br />\nConcerto in A minor for Piano<br />\nand Orchestra; Mr. Ivan Davis,<br />\na prize-winning young Texan,<br />\nwas the soloist. Mr. Davis seen<br />\nat the piano, is reminiscent of<br />\nGlen Gould. That is to say, he<br />\nbecomes physically involved in<br />\nthe music. Throughout the performance, Mr. Davis weaved<br />\nand bobbed, shook and spun,<br />\nlooking now delighted, now<br />\nsmiling beatifically, now frown.<br />\nmg aggressively.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE FIVE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, JANUARY 20, 1961<br />\n<br />\nNew Library Plans To Include<br />\n<br />\nB&M<br />\nDELICATESSEN AND SANDWICH SHOP<br />\n<br />\nSpecial Audio-Visual Center<br />\n<br />\n301 EAST 31ST STREET, Cor. of Guilford Ave.<br />\nJUST ONE BLOCK FROM THE FRATERNITY HOUSES<br />\nTelephone No. CH. 3-9294<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from Page 4)<br />\n<br />\nFeaturing Fine Pizza Pies<br />\n<br />\nundergraduate readings.

Well sir, some say<br />\nthat in order to be called truly small, a college should have an<br />\nenrollment of not more than four students.<br />\nI certainly have no quarrel with this statement; a fourstudent college must unquestionably be called small. Indeed,<br />\none could even call it intinze if one knew what intime meant.<br />\nBut I submit there is such a thing as being too small. Take, for<br />\ninstance,a recent unfortunate occurrence at Crimscott A and M.<br />\nCrimscott A and M, situated in a pleasant valley nestled<br />\nbetween Denver and Baltimore, was founded by A. and M.<br />\nCrimscott, two brothers who left Ireland in 1706 to escape the<br />\npotato famine of 1841. As a result of their foresight, the Crimscott brothers never went without potatoes for one single day of<br />\ntheir lives\u2014aid mighty grateful they were One night, full<br />\ngratitude after a hearty meal of French fries, cottage fries, hash<br />\nbrowns, and au gratin, they decided to show their appreciation<br />\nto this bountiful land of potatoes by endowing a college. They<br />\nstipulated that enrollment should never exceed four students<br />\nbecause they felt that only by keeping the college this small<br />\n<br />\nor<br />\n<br />\nfabga<br />\n<br />\nFlexibility Stressed<br />\nAccording to Mr. Bethel, the<br />\nnew library is being constructed<br />\non a \"modular plan\" which emphasizes flexibility. Thus all<br />\nstacks in the new building as<br />\nwell as offices and carrels could<br />\nbe rearranged in the future to<br />\ncomply with then existing needs.<br />\nMr. Bethel noted the contrast<br />\nbetween this flexibility and the<br />\ncurrent Gilman set up where<br />\nthe stacks are permament and<br />\ncan not be moved to conform<br />\nwith current needs.<br />\nAs currently envisioned, the<br />\nnew library will be all open<br />\nstacks. There will be book check<br />\ncounters at the two entrances<br />\nbut there will be free access to<br />\nall stacks in the library by any<br />\nstudent, graduate or undergraduate, at the University.<br />\nUnderground Expansion<br />\nMuch of the future flexibility<br />\nof the library rests upon its<br />\nrather unique structure. Because<br />\nof its location it would be possible to extend the library under-<br />\n<br />\nground<br />\nin<br />\nthree<br />\ndirections<br />\n(north toward Homewood House,<br />\nwest toward Gilman Hall, and<br />\nsouth toward Rowland) thus<br />\nproviding more room for book<br />\nstorage. The initial building is<br />\nbeing designed to hold 1,500,000 v olum e s. However, by<br />\nunderground extension it would<br />\nbe possible to increase the size<br />\nof the library by 2,000,000<br />\nvolumes.<br />\nBecause of the fact that much<br />\nof the library will be underground the whole building will<br />\nbe air-conditioned and every<br />\nroom will be lighted by fluorescent lamps. In addition to the<br />\nspace available in the new library, there would be storage<br />\nspace in Gilman Hall for 800,000 volumes which will be used<br />\nfor books of little or no demand.<br />\nStudy Carrels Planned<br />\nMr. Bethel stated that currently the plans for the new research library call for 500 student study carrels and 350 faculty studies. He also pointed<br />\nout that there will be no large<br />\nreading rooms in the library.<br />\nInstead, numerous tables and<br />\nindividual study desks will be<br />\npositioned throughout the stacks.<br />\nAlso the library will contain<br />\nseveral small seminar rooms.<br />\n<br />\nIt would bring together all<br />\nthe research collections of the<br />\nUniversity under one roof where<br />\nthey could be efficiently organized.<br />\nIt would provide privacy for<br />\nresearch and immediate accessibility to the total library collection.<br />\nIt would continue the Hop.<br />\nkins tradition of placing faculty,<br />\nbooks and students in proximity.<br />\nFacilities Planned<br />\nThe research library would<br />\ninclude in its facilities two areas<br />\nthat presently are not serviced in<br />\nany central area of the University. The first of these is a<br />\nspecial collections area. At present the special collections of the<br />\nUniversity are housed in several<br />\ndifferent and separated buildings.<br />\nIncluded in this department<br />\nwould be rare books, manuscripts, broadsides, pr in t s,<br />\ncharts, plans, maps, pictures and<br />\ncoins. Because of the nature of<br />\nsuch a collection, extreme care<br />\nmust be exercised in its storage.<br />\n<br />\nThe second area will be a<br />\nservice and storage area for<br />\nphoto-duplicated materials, records, tape, and the necessary<br />\nreading machines and record<br />\nBenefits Listed<br />\nplayers. Included in this secAmong the benefits such a tion would be a language laboracentral research library will tory as well as storage areas for<br />\nbring are the following:<br />\nmicrofilm.<br />\n<br />\ner/6/6fi<br />\n<br />\ncould each student be assured of the personalized attention, the<br />\ncamaraderie, the feeling of belonging, that is all too often lacking<br />\nin higher education.<br />\nWell sir, things went along swimmingly until one Saturday a<br />\nfew years ago. On this day Crimscott had a football game<br />\nscheduled against Minnesota,its traditional rival. Football was,<br />\nof course, something of a problem at Crimscott, what with only<br />\nfour students enrolled in the entire college. It was easy enough<br />\nto muster a backfield, but finding a good line\u2014or even a bad<br />\nline\u2014baffled the most resourceful coaching minds in the country.<br />\nWell sir, on the morning of the big game against Minnesota,<br />\nits traditional rival, a capricious destiny dealt Crimscott a cruel<br />\nblow\u2014in fact, four cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback,<br />\nwoke up that,morning with the breakbone fever. Wrichards, the<br />\nslotback, was unable to start his motorcycle. Beerbohm-Tree,<br />\nthe wingback-tailback, got his necktie caught in his espresso<br />\nmachine. Langerhans, the fullback, was stolen by gypsies.<br />\nConsequently, alas, none of the Crimscott team showed up at<br />\nthe game,and Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to score<br />\nalmost at will. Crimscott was so out of sorts that they immediately broke off football relations with Minnesota,its traditional<br />\nrival. This later became known as the Dred Scott Decision.<br />\nSo you can see how only four students might be too small an<br />\nenrollment. The number I personally favor is twenty. How<br />\ncome? Because when you have twenty students and one of<br />\nthem opens a pack of Marlboro Cigarettes, there are enough to<br />\ngo around for everybody, and no one has to be deprived of<br />\nMarlboro's fine, mild flavor, of Marlboro's easy-drawing filter,<br />\nof Marlboro's joy and zest and steadfast companionship, and<br />\nas a result you have a student body that is filled with sweet<br />\ncontent and amity and harmony and concord and togetherness<br />\nand soft pack and flip-top box.<br />\n1961 Ma.Shulmanb,<br />\nThat's how come.<br />\ne<br />\n\u2022 \u2022<br />\nYou will also find twenty cigarettes\u2014twenty incomparable<br />\nunfiltered king-size cigarettes\u2014in each pack of Marlboro's<br />\nnew partner in pleasure\u2014the Philip Morris commander.<br />\nWelcome aboard!<br />\n<br />\nWhen things get too close for comfort<br />\n<br />\nduptee STICK DEODORANT<br />\nCowtal /0<br />\n<br />\nNeu&<br />\n<br />\nast<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Old Spice Stick Deodorant brings you safe,<br />\nsure, all-day protection!<br />\n\u2022 Better than roll-ons that skip.<br />\n\u2022 Better than sprays that drip.<br />\nNEW<br />\n\u2022 Better than creams that are greasy<br />\nand messy.<br />\n<br />\nPLASTIC CASE<br />\nPRE\u2022SET<br />\nFOR INSTANT USE<br />\n1.00 on lea<br />\n<br />\ns<br />\nO<br />\n\"Cu \u2022,000g*'<br />\n<br />\nBy land or by sea\u2014you need this Social Security!<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE SIX<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\n<br />\nR.<br />\nFencers Break Even<br />\nTo Face Muhlenberg<br />\nFencing two meets the same<br />\nday, the varsity fencers broke<br />\neven before knocking off for<br />\nthe exam break.

This time two years<br />\nago, there was no formal team,<br />\nmerely a handful of boys who<br />\nenjoyed the sport and who were<br />\nable to obtain use of the school's<br />\nfacilities. Last year, in their<br />\nfirst year of scheduled intercollegiate competition, the Blue<br />\nJays compiled an impressive<br />\n5-1-1 record and finished third<br />\nin the Mason-Dixon Tournament.<br />\n<br />\nIt seems as if every season<br />\nboasts its candidate for the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Purple Heart.<br />\nThis award is given every year<br />\nto that team which undergoes<br />\nthe greatest number of trials<br />\nand tribulations and still manages to come out on top in spirit<br />\nand accomplishment. In the fall,<br />\nthe candidate was the football<br />\nsquad; this winter the basketball team places its name in<br />\nnomination.<br />\n<br />\nTo more graphically illustrate<br />\nthe plight of Coach Sach's squad,<br />\nwe cite an incident which occurred in the Western Maryland<br />\ngame.<br />\n<br />\n5 men were on the floor playing as well as they could, but<br />\nIn its most recent outings, for tired from a hard fought first<br />\nexample, Hopkins, manned by half. Although Coach Sachs<br />\nonly 8 men, has performed very<br />\nwell for the first 20 minutes. The<br />\nteam made 47% of its shots in<br />\nthe first half against Franklin<br />\nand Marshall, which it conquered by a score of 74-63, and<br />\nWestern Maryland, which defeated the Hopkins Warriors by<br />\na score of 90-57 largely by tiring them out in the second half.<br />\nAgainst Washington College,<br />\nlitle 5-11 Jaan Sulg and bigger<br />\n6-3 Rick Saull had to battle for<br />\nrebounds against three men who<br />\nwere 6-6, 6-6, and 6-4. The<br />\namazing thing about this uneven match of skill is that Saull<br />\nand Sulg, came out ahead on<br />\na remarkable number of occasions.

It is good<br />\nthat the Council has seen fit to enlighten the student body<br />\non its work; it is courageous that they have done so in<br />\nyieNv of the lack of real accomplishment shown therein.<br />\nHow the writer of the report can blithely remark that<br />\n\"the major accomplishment of the Council was the sponsorship of the Student-Faculty Camp\" when it is a wellknown fact that much of the work of organization of the<br />\ncamp was completed prior to their taking office, we can't<br />\nunderstand. Similarly, we find nothing to indicate that<br />\nthe \"Council has shown marked interest in the race problem.\" It hasn't been mentioned since last spring.<br />\nIt is interesting to note that \"after a poor start due<br />\nto personnel difficulties, the SC Assembly Conference<br />\nCommittee is now functioning smoothly.\" Our only question: Where are assemblies?<br />\nOther matters mentioned by the report are steps forward (additional members on the Goucher-Hopkins Coordination Committee; expanding the activities of the Public Relations Committee) but these are small steps forward<br />\nin view of what the Council could do and has not done.<br />\nWhat the Council omits from the report is that topic<br />\nabout which most of its meetings have revolved this<br />\nsemester: the SAC-SC relationship\u2014a problem which,<br />\nas of now, has yet to be solved.<br />\nWhatever the case, the Council has failed to come<br />\nup with new ideas, to provide speakers for assemblies,<br />\nand, worst of all, has failed to settle the contradictions<br />\nwithin its own house.

We lost our two<br />\nrebound men and another who<br />\nhad just put two 12 point games<br />\nback to back before stopping for<br />\nthe rest of the semester.

Steinwald<br /><br />\nMusic In The Air<br /><br />\nConcert Series Well Received<br />\nBy MARK PEREL<br />\nOn January 15 the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony Orchestra under the<br />\ndirection of Peter Herman Adler presented the first in a<br />\nseries of two concerts in Shriver<br />\nHall. There has been cause in<br />\nthe past to say many unkind<br />\nthings about the orchestra's<br />\nconcerts, but if we are to judge<br />\nby Sunday's performance we<br />\nmust now recognize the astonishing improvement which Dr.<br />\nAdler has wrought in the orchestra. They play the notes<br />\ncorrectly, they play together,<br />\nand often they display considerable dynamic subtlety. Sunday's<br />\nprogram was, consequently, an<br />\nenjoyable experience.<br />\nMaestro Adler began the program with the Beethoven Third<br />\nSymphony (\"Eroica\"). It was<br />\ngiven a highly dramatic but<br />\nuneccentric reading by the conductor, notable for its taut control and the orchestra's exemplary ensemble playing. The<br />\nfirst movement was flexible in<br /><br />\nwith finely<br />\ndynamic range<br />\nstressed orchestral clarity. If<br />\nthe great slow movement did<br />\nnot probe the depths of the<br />\nsoul, it did move along with<br />\ngreat dignity, the conductor resisting the temptation to linger<br />\nover and unnecessarily sentimentalize phrases. A bouyant<br />\nScherzo featuring fine woodwind<br />\nplaying and great verve was<br />\neven more enhanced by facile<br />\nplaying of the tricky French<br />\nhorn passages in the trio. Dr.<br />\nAdler interpreted the fourth<br />\nmovement, marked Allegro molto<br />\nvery literally, and thus began<br />\nat quite a fast clip. It was extremely satisfying to see, however, that things never got out<br />\nof hand interpretively, nor did<br />\nthe orchestra seem pushed beyond its capabilities. In sum,<br />\nDr. Adler told us nothing<br />\nthe<br />\nabout<br />\nnew<br />\nstartlingly<br />\n\"Eroica,\" but presented credible and musicianly ideas, his<br />\norchestra communicating them<br />\nwith utmost subtlety.<br />\nDvorak's short but masterful<br /><br />\nScherzo Capriccios\u00b0, Op. 66 followed the intermission. Suffice<br />\nit to say that here again the<br />\norchestra displayed itself to best<br />\nadvantage, playing very well<br />\nindeed. The reading was, however, somewhat staid and too<br />\nevenly regulated for the alternating moods of impetuosity<br />\nand waltzing lyricism. A bit<br />\nless careful control by the conductor would have allowed some<br />\nof the abandon of Dvorak's<br />\ntemperament to infect the audience to a greater degree.<br />\nThe program concluded with<br />\nthe playing of the Schumann<br />\nConcerto in A minor for Piano<br />\nand Orchestra; Mr. Ivan Davis,<br />\na prize-winning young Texan,<br />\nwas the soloist. Mr. Davis seen<br />\nat the piano, is reminiscent of<br />\nGlen Gould. That is to say, he<br />\nbecomes physically involved in<br />\nthe music. Throughout the performance, Mr. Davis weaved<br />\nand bobbed, shook and spun,<br />\nlooking now delighted, now<br />\nsmiling beatifically, now frown.<br />\nmg aggressively.<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, JANUARY 20, 1961<br /><br />\nNew Library Plans To Include<br /><br />\nB&amp;M<br />\nDELICATESSEN AND SANDWICH SHOP<br /><br />\nSpecial Audio-Visual Center<br /><br />\n301 EAST 31ST STREET, Cor. of Guilford Ave.<br />\nJUST ONE BLOCK FROM THE FRATERNITY HOUSES<br />\nTelephone No. CH. 3-9294<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 4)<br /><br />\nFeaturing Fine Pizza Pies<br /><br />\nundergraduate readings.

Well sir, some say<br />\nthat in order to be called truly small, a college should have an<br />\nenrollment of not more than four students.<br />\nI certainly have no quarrel with this statement; a fourstudent college must unquestionably be called small. Indeed,<br />\none could even call it intinze if one knew what intime meant.<br />\nBut I submit there is such a thing as being too small. Take, for<br />\ninstance,a recent unfortunate occurrence at Crimscott A and M.<br />\nCrimscott A and M, situated in a pleasant valley nestled<br />\nbetween Denver and Baltimore, was founded by A. and M.<br />\nCrimscott, two brothers who left Ireland in 1706 to escape the<br />\npotato famine of 1841. As a result of their foresight, the Crimscott brothers never went without potatoes for one single day of<br />\ntheir lives\u2014aid mighty grateful they were One night, full<br />\ngratitude after a hearty meal of French fries, cottage fries, hash<br />\nbrowns, and au gratin, they decided to show their appreciation<br />\nto this bountiful land of potatoes by endowing a college. They<br />\nstipulated that enrollment should never exceed four students<br />\nbecause they felt that only by keeping the college this small<br /><br />\nor<br /><br />\nfabga<br /><br />\nFlexibility Stressed<br />\nAccording to Mr. Bethel, the<br />\nnew library is being constructed<br />\non a \"modular plan\" which emphasizes flexibility. Thus all<br />\nstacks in the new building as<br />\nwell as offices and carrels could<br />\nbe rearranged in the future to<br />\ncomply with then existing needs.<br />\nMr. Bethel noted the contrast<br />\nbetween this flexibility and the<br />\ncurrent Gilman set up where<br />\nthe stacks are permament and<br />\ncan not be moved to conform<br />\nwith current needs.<br />\nAs currently envisioned, the<br />\nnew library will be all open<br />\nstacks. There will be book check<br />\ncounters at the two entrances<br />\nbut there will be free access to<br />\nall stacks in the library by any<br />\nstudent, graduate or undergraduate, at the University.<br />\nUnderground Expansion<br />\nMuch of the future flexibility<br />\nof the library rests upon its<br />\nrather unique structure. Because<br />\nof its location it would be possible to extend the library under-<br /><br />\nground<br />\nin<br />\nthree<br />\ndirections<br />\n(north toward Homewood House,<br />\nwest toward Gilman Hall, and<br />\nsouth toward Rowland) thus<br />\nproviding more room for book<br />\nstorage. The initial building is<br />\nbeing designed to hold 1,500,000 v olum e s. However, by<br />\nunderground extension it would<br />\nbe possible to increase the size<br />\nof the library by 2,000,000<br />\nvolumes.<br />\nBecause of the fact that much<br />\nof the library will be underground the whole building will<br />\nbe air-conditioned and every<br />\nroom will be lighted by fluorescent lamps. In addition to the<br />\nspace available in the new library, there would be storage<br />\nspace in Gilman Hall for 800,000 volumes which will be used<br />\nfor books of little or no demand.<br />\nStudy Carrels Planned<br />\nMr. Bethel stated that currently the plans for the new research library call for 500 student study carrels and 350 faculty studies. He also pointed<br />\nout that there will be no large<br />\nreading rooms in the library.<br />\nInstead, numerous tables and<br />\nindividual study desks will be<br />\npositioned throughout the stacks.<br />\nAlso the library will contain<br />\nseveral small seminar rooms.<br /><br />\nIt would bring together all<br />\nthe research collections of the<br />\nUniversity under one roof where<br />\nthey could be efficiently organized.<br />\nIt would provide privacy for<br />\nresearch and immediate accessibility to the total library collection.<br />\nIt would continue the Hop.<br />\nkins tradition of placing faculty,<br />\nbooks and students in proximity.<br />\nFacilities Planned<br />\nThe research library would<br />\ninclude in its facilities two areas<br />\nthat presently are not serviced in<br />\nany central area of the University. The first of these is a<br />\nspecial collections area. At present the special collections of the<br />\nUniversity are housed in several<br />\ndifferent and separated buildings.<br />\nIncluded in this department<br />\nwould be rare books, manuscripts, broadsides, pr in t s,<br />\ncharts, plans, maps, pictures and<br />\ncoins. Because of the nature of<br />\nsuch a collection, extreme care<br />\nmust be exercised in its storage.<br /><br />\nThe second area will be a<br />\nservice and storage area for<br />\nphoto-duplicated materials, records, tape, and the necessary<br />\nreading machines and record<br />\nBenefits Listed<br />\nplayers. Included in this secAmong the benefits such a tion would be a language laboracentral research library will tory as well as storage areas for<br />\nbring are the following:<br />\nmicrofilm.<br /><br />\ner/6/6fi<br /><br />\ncould each student be assured of the personalized attention, the<br />\ncamaraderie, the feeling of belonging, that is all too often lacking<br />\nin higher education.<br />\nWell sir, things went along swimmingly until one Saturday a<br />\nfew years ago. On this day Crimscott had a football game<br />\nscheduled against Minnesota,its traditional rival. Football was,<br />\nof course, something of a problem at Crimscott, what with only<br />\nfour students enrolled in the entire college. It was easy enough<br />\nto muster a backfield, but finding a good line\u2014or even a bad<br />\nline\u2014baffled the most resourceful coaching minds in the country.<br />\nWell sir, on the morning of the big game against Minnesota,<br />\nits traditional rival, a capricious destiny dealt Crimscott a cruel<br />\nblow\u2014in fact, four cruel blows. Sigafoos, the quarterback,<br />\nwoke up that,morning with the breakbone fever. Wrichards, the<br />\nslotback, was unable to start his motorcycle. Beerbohm-Tree,<br />\nthe wingback-tailback, got his necktie caught in his espresso<br />\nmachine. Langerhans, the fullback, was stolen by gypsies.<br />\nConsequently, alas, none of the Crimscott team showed up at<br />\nthe game,and Minnesota, its traditional rival, was able to score<br />\nalmost at will. Crimscott was so out of sorts that they immediately broke off football relations with Minnesota,its traditional<br />\nrival. This later became known as the Dred Scott Decision.<br />\nSo you can see how only four students might be too small an<br />\nenrollment. The number I personally favor is twenty. How<br />\ncome?

This time two years<br />\nago, there was no formal team,<br />\nmerely a handful of boys who<br />\nenjoyed the sport and who were<br />\nable to obtain use of the school's<br />\nfacilities. Last year, in their<br />\nfirst year of scheduled intercollegiate competition, the Blue<br />\nJays compiled an impressive<br />\n5-1-1 record and finished third<br />\nin the Mason-Dixon Tournament.<br /><br />\nIt seems as if every season<br />\nboasts its candidate for the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Purple Heart.<br />\nThis award is given every year<br />\nto that team which undergoes<br />\nthe greatest number of trials<br />\nand tribulations and still manages to come out on top in spirit<br />\nand accomplishment. In the fall,<br />\nthe candidate was the football<br />\nsquad; this winter the basketball team places its name in<br />\nnomination.<br /><br />\nTo more graphically illustrate<br />\nthe plight of Coach Sach's squad,<br />\nwe cite an incident which occurred in the Western Maryland<br />\ngame.<br /><br />\n5 men were on the floor playing as well as they could, but<br />\nIn its most recent outings, for tired from a hard fought first<br />\nexample, Hopkins, manned by half. Although Coach Sachs<br />\nonly 8 men, has performed very<br />\nwell for the first 20 minutes. The<br />\nteam made 47% of its shots in<br />\nthe first half against Franklin<br />\nand Marshall, which it conquered by a score of 74-63, and<br />\nWestern Maryland, which defeated the Hopkins Warriors by<br />\na score of 90-57 largely by tiring them out in the second half.<br />\nAgainst Washington College,<br />\nlitle 5-11 Jaan Sulg and bigger<br />\n6-3 Rick Saull had to battle for<br />\nrebounds against three men who<br />\nwere 6-6, 6-6, and 6-4. The<br />\namazing thing about this uneven match of skill is that Saull<br />\nand Sulg, came out ahead on<br />\na remarkable number of occasions.
