Since<br />\ntheir foundation, the Turnbull lectures have been regarded in academic circles as one of the most<br />\nimportant series delivered throughout the country, and the men who<br />\nhave been selected under this<br />\nfoundation in the past have been<br />\nmen who have stood to the fore in<br />\ntheir respective fields, and who<br />\nhave enjoyed reputations for<br />\nscholarship not only in this country,<br />\nbut also throughout all Europe.<br />\nThe selection made by the committee this year, measured by these<br />\nstandards, is particularly happy.<br />\nDr. More is a man who, both<br />\nin scholastic and in journalistic endeavor, has achieved heights which<br />\ngrant to him, without question, the<br />\nright to be considered one of the<br />\nforemost literary men of the day.<br />\nHis subject also is one which is of<br />\npeculiar interest to Hopkins men,<br />\nincluding as it does the consideration of Sidney Lanier, the poet<br />\nwhom Hopkins will always proudly<br />\nregard as its own. Yet, in itself,<br />\nthe subject of \"The Poets of<br />\nAmerica\" should be one to awaken<br />\ninterest in every man who has<br />\ndipped, even if only slightly, into<br />\nthe pages of our national literature.<br />\nThe enormous attendance which<br />\neach of the lectures so far given<br />\nhas drawn is ample proof of the<br />\nkeen interest and delight which the<br />\nannouncement of both lecturer and<br />\nsubject has evoked throughout the<br />\n<br />\no<br />\nveEtITtTuErRe,s otn<br />\nNa Eawins-L<br />\no;wyn\u2022et T<br />\nbehalf, g<br />\nexpress the appreciation felt by all<br />\nHopkins for the honor Dr. More<br />\nhas conferred upon the University<br />\nby his acceptance of the Turnbull<br />\ncommittee's invitation.<br />\nThe Y.

The<br />\npractice game with the Orioles was<br />\nscheduled only a week ago, and,<br />\nall things considered, the fact that<br />\nthe local nine held the professionals<br />\nto a score which would not have<br />\ndisgraced a member of the International League, despite the fact<br />\nthat the Orioles have been in training grounds over a month, bodes<br />\nwell for the outlook of the team.<br />\nThe score of last Saturday's<br />\ngame:<br />\n<br />\nThe large attendance which<br />\ngreeted the local Young Men's<br />\nChristian Association's first election to be held before a student<br />\nmass-meeting is significant.

The former played a splendid game at cover-point<br />\nduring the time he was in the game,<br />\nand while at times a bit uncertain<br />\nin his \"going through,\" showed\u2022<br />\nmuch natural athletic ability.<br />\nSwartz was at first very wild in his<br />\nattempts at goal, when substituted<br />\nin the second half, but toward the<br />\nend of the contest settled down and<br />\nshowed work of considerable promise. Meyer and Wilson also played<br />\nwell, but not in a noticeable manner. A word should, however, be<br />\nsaid of the work of Arthur Knipp<br />\nat in-home. Knipp last played on<br />\nthe 'Varsity team in 1906, but his<br />\nwork gave no evidence of the lapse<br />\nof years; \"once a lacrosse player,<br />\nalways a lacrosse player.\"<br />\nFor the Alumni, La Motte, Mealy.<br />\nand Lowndes were the bright<br />\nlights: The first two did all their<br />\nteam's scoring while advisor \"Bob\"<br />\nwas a wonder in the mid-field. His<br />\ncondition was probably the best of<br />\nthe Alumni, since he had practiced<br />\nsteadily with the 'Varsity for over<br />\na week. In addition to them the<br />\nwhole Alumni defense should be<br />\nmentioned, especially the work of<br />\nChalmers at goal. Walter Blank<br />\nwas not on the job for the graduates<br />\nfor the first time in many years,<br />\nand in his stead Chalmers, who is<br />\na 'Varsity sub, was used. Some of<br />\nhis stops were of a most spectacular nature and he gives promise of<br />\nbeing a most worthy substitute for<br />\nStuart.<br />\nAs has been the custom, for<br />\nyears, no admission was charged<br />\nfor the contest, and an audience of<br />\nover 800 friends of the teams were<br />\npresent in response to the invitations which had been sent out.

Bonn, of<br />\nthe University, of Munich, on \"Germany's Economic Problem.\"<br />\nIn the first of these lectures,<br />\nProfessor Bonn explained that, in<br />\norder that the peculiar genius of<br />\nthe German people.. might be developed, it was necessary for them to<br />\nremain under the German \u2022flag, and<br />\nfor them to 'speak the.

The expenses at the<br />\ncamp itself are $22.50, but the total<br />\nexpenses are nearly $50. The plan<br />\nadvanced by Mr. Stuart to allow<br />\nall to meet this expense is for the<br />\nHopkins students interested in the<br />\ncamp to form a club and elect a<br />\nsecretary. Then, if a member could<br />\nnot. afford to go to the camp this<br />\nsummer, he could give his name to<br />\nthe secretary who, in turn, would<br />\nnotify Mr. Gustavus Ober, secretary of the Maryland National Defense League. Mr. Ober, Mr.<br />\nStuart said, could in all probability<br />\nfurnish the desired funds.

Consequently, the victory is<br />\ndue to W. B. Pratt, who shot the<br />\nperfect score of 200, and to H. A.<br />\nRowland, who made 199. The<br />\nother scores made by the members<br />\nof the Hopkins squad were 196,<br />\nbyj. M. C. Van TIulsteyn 192 by<br />\nJ. W. Young, and 192 by J. E.<br />\nKonze. The highest mark made by<br />\nthe Oregon Aggies was 196.<br />\nDuring- the week of March 20,<br />\nthe club held a match with the five<br />\nmen- representing the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and<br />\nmade a score of 904, the second to<br />\nighest aggregate score shot by<br />\nany team in the National Rifle<br />\nLeague this year. A number of<br />\nmen who have been shooting steadily, but who have not starred, came<br />\nto the front in this match. Pratt,<br />\nas usual, shot 200, and Rowland<br />\nand Sanner, '18, followed close<br />\nwith 198 each. The other two tallies were 194 by Wiggins, and 194<br />\nby Chisholm. Although the official<br />\nresults have not yet been announced, there is no doubt in the minds<br />\nof the members of the club that<br />\nthey defeated their opponents. \u2022<br />\nLast week the match between the<br />\nHopkins team and that of Rensslaer College took place and here<br />\nagain it is practically certain that<br />\nthe local squad was victorious.<br />\nThis week, on April 4, the club<br />\nshoots the last match of its indoor<br />\nseason with Harvard University.<br />\n<br />\nthough there were to be three participants\u2022 in the contest, Earl Steynan,'19, was prevented from speaking by sickness.

After this, the new officers<br />\nwill immediately enter upon the<br />\nfulfillment of their respective duties.<br />\nNot only have most of these officers had a large amount of experience in Young Men's Christian<br />\nAssociation work, but all of them<br />\nare also prominent in other Hopkins activities.

They point out that, next<br />\nfall, the University will be drawn<br />\ncloser together because of its location at Homewood, and, in this<br />\nmanner, the Association will be<br />\nable to accomplish its work with<br />\nincreased effectiveness.<br />\nThe Association has announced<br />\nthis week, although with much regret, that it will not be possible<br />\nfor Mr. Sunday to speak at the<br />\nUniversity.

The former played a splendid game at cover-point<br />\nduring the time he was in the game,<br />\nand while at times a bit uncertain<br />\nin his \"going through,\" showed\u2022<br />\nmuch natural athletic ability.<br />\nSwartz was at first very wild in his<br />\nattempts at goal, when substituted<br />\nin the second half, but toward the<br />\nend of the contest settled down and<br />\nshowed work of considerable promise. Meyer and Wilson also played<br />\nwell, but not in a noticeable manner. A word should, however, be<br />\nsaid of the work of Arthur Knipp<br />\nat in-home. Knipp last played on<br />\nthe 'Varsity team in 1906, but his<br />\nwork gave no evidence of the lapse<br />\nof years; \"once a lacrosse player,<br />\nalways a lacrosse player.\"<br />\nFor the Alumni, La Motte, Mealy.<br />\nand Lowndes were the bright<br />\nlights: The first two did all their<br />\nteam's scoring while advisor \"Bob\"<br />\nwas a wonder in the mid-field. His<br />\ncondition was probably the best of<br />\nthe Alumni, since he had practiced<br />\nsteadily with the 'Varsity for over<br />\na week. In addition to them the<br />\nwhole Alumni defense should be<br />\nmentioned, especially the work of<br />\nChalmers at goal. Walter Blank<br />\nwas not on the job for the graduates<br />\nfor the first time in many years,<br />\nand in his stead Chalmers, who is<br />\na 'Varsity sub, was used. Some of<br />\nhis stops were of a most spectacular nature and he gives promise of<br />\nbeing a most worthy substitute for<br />\nStuart.<br />\nAs has been the custom, for<br />\nyears, no admission was charged<br />\nfor the contest, and an audience of<br />\nover 800 friends of the teams were<br />\npresent in response to the invitations which had been sent out.

Bonn, of<br />\nthe University, of Munich, on \"Germany's Economic Problem.\"<br />\nIn the first of these lectures,<br />\nProfessor Bonn explained that, in<br />\norder that the peculiar genius of<br />\nthe German people.. might be developed, it was necessary for them to<br />\nremain under the German \u2022flag, and<br />\nfor them to 'speak the.

The expenses at the<br />\ncamp itself are $22.50, but the total<br />\nexpenses are nearly $50. The plan<br />\nadvanced by Mr. Stuart to allow<br />\nall to meet this expense is for the<br />\nHopkins students interested in the<br />\ncamp to form a club and elect a<br />\nsecretary. Then, if a member could<br />\nnot. afford to go to the camp this<br />\nsummer, he could give his name to<br />\nthe secretary who, in turn, would<br />\nnotify Mr. Gustavus Ober, secretary of the Maryland National Defense League. Mr. Ober, Mr.<br />\nStuart said, could in all probability<br />\nfurnish the desired funds.
