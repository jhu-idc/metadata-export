At<br />\nsuch a tune it is only natural<br />\nthat a discussion of the Honor<br />\nSystem should take place.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER regretted at<br />\nthe time of the mid-year exams to<br />\nhear the many rumors of cheating<br />\nwhich were then flying around the<br />\ncampus; and it regretted still<br />\nmore the inability of those in authority to trace these rumors and<br />\nto punish the offenders\u2014for there<br />\nwere many breaches of the Honor<br />\nSystem. The inability of the Student Council and of the Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa to get facts and evidence is the more lamentable,<br />\nsince it was caused by the general<br />\nattitude of indifference on the<br />\npart of the student body\u2014a feelthat it was none of your business<br />\nwhether the other fellow cheated;<br />\nthat you would be a tale-bearer<br />\nif you reported him. This was<br />\nthe attitude which the investigators found it impossible to<br />\ncombat.<br />\nThere is no use to bemoan or<br />\nto attempt to condone this attitude.

May 6, the largest<br />\nmeeting this year of the Undergraduate Mathematics Club was<br />\naddressed by Professor Lorraine<br />\nS. Hulburt. Dr. Hulburt's subject was, \"The Circular Points at<br />\nInfinity.\" In order to make the<br />\nsubject intelligible to the uninitiated, he only skirted the misty<br />\nmid-region of projective geometry<br />\nand approached the two circular<br />\npoints by the open road of analytics.

Dr. Singewald was<br />\ngranted leave of absence to return to South America early last<br />\nDecember, shortly after his return<br />\nfrom the George Huntington<br />\nWilliams' Memorial Expeditions<br />\nto South America, which was sent<br />\nout by the University toward the<br />\nclose of the last academic year.<br />\nOn that expedition, Professors<br />\nBerry and Singewald were unable<br />\nto visit the northern part of Peru,<br />\na region of considerable importance in the geologic history of<br />\nthe west coast of South America.<br />\nOn this trip, Dr. Singewald spent<br />\nconsiderable time in an exhaustive investigation of that part of<br />\nthat region. In addition to making a careful study of the stratigraphy of the area, Dr. Singewald<br />\nsecured a large collection of fos.:<br />\nsils, which he has brought with<br />\nhim for the Department of Geology, and which will be the object of further researches in that<br />\ndepartment.<br />\nThis riew study of some of the geologic problems of -South America<br />\nfits in excellently with the work of<br />\nthe Williams' Expedition and will<br />\npermit of more comprehensive interpretation of the South American work previously done by<br />\nmembers of the Geologic Department. This is Dr. Singewald's<br />\nthird geologic expedition to South<br />\nAmerica. For five years he has<br />\nbeen specializing in the geology<br />\nand mineral resources of that continent and now ranks among the<br />\nhighest authorities in that field.<br />\nThe region in which Dr. Singewald worked is close to the sea<br />\nand at less than 4\u00b0 S. latitude,<br />\nso that he avoided the unusually<br />\nsevere winter of the United States<br />\nand instead suffered extremely hot<br />\nweather.

The inability of the Student Council and of the Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa to get facts and evidence is the more lamentable,<br />\nsince it was caused by the general<br />\nattitude of indifference on the<br />\npart of the student body\u2014a feelthat it was none of your business<br />\nwhether the other fellow cheated;<br />\nthat you would be a tale-bearer<br />\nif you reported him. This was<br />\nthe attitude which the investigators found it impossible to<br />\ncombat.<br />\nThere is no use to bemoan or<br />\nto attempt to condone this attitude. It is true that there. was<br />\nan unprecedented amount of<br />\ncheating at mid-years, and that<br />\nthe offenders could not be brought<br />\nto justice on account of the unwillingness of the students to<br />\nprosecute them. The issue is<br />\nsquarely before us, and the ques-<br /><br />\nthm arises. -What are you going<br />\nto do about it?\"<br />\nThere seems but two possible<br />\nalternatives to THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nReturn to the Proctor System of<br />\na bygone day or an Honor System<br />\nwhich is enforced to the letter.<br />\nThe way in which the present system operates, namely, leaving it<br />\nup to the individual whether or<br />\nnot he is to cheat, is, in the opinion of THE NEWS-LEWER, out of<br />\nthe question, since it is fair<br />\nneither to the faculty nor to the<br />\nhonest student.<br />\nA return to the Proctor System would be a disgrace to the<br />\nUniversity and to the student<br />\nbody. It would amount to the<br />\nstatement that we are unworthy of any confidence which might be<br />\nplaced ill us. It would be a confession that we are unfit to be<br />\ncalled college men. It would be<br />\nthe honest giving away before the<br />\ndishonest, the humbling of the<br />\nvust majority before the small<br /><br />\neditors when asked and in most<br />\ncases they furnish this information of their own accord.<br />\nSuch co-operation, unfortunately, does not exist at _Hopkins.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER plays practically a lone hand in the collee:<br />\nlion of news..

But there is yet another fact, weightier by far, which<br />\nwas still less manifest to the Assembly. This fact is that there<br />\nare attempts being made to foist<br />\nupon us the insidious doctrine of<br />\nclass-war, which has envenomed<br />\nRussia, and that such autocratic<br />\nacts as that of the New York<br />\nAssembly cannot but inflame the<br />\npeople, and thus make way for<br />\nthe Bolshevist serpent.<br />\nHeretofore, we have very ofteti<br />\nliven afflicted with men who were<br />\nwont to perch themselves upop<br />\nthe soap-box and by dint of fiery<br />\nspeech and bloody words incite<br />\nthe 1)01)111:ace to rise .up in arms<br />\nagainst our th)vernment.. What<br />\nhas been our reply to such agitators? Our reply has amounted<br />\nto this:<br />\n\"Attention, you who wotild<br />\nilreach revolution! Yoh' are misdirecting your energies here. It<br />\nis all well and good to preach<br />\nrevolution in an absolute monarchy, where revolution is the<br />\nonly means whereby a suppressed<br />\nand discontented people may improve its condition. But this<br />\ncountry of ours is not an absolute monarchy; it is a republic.<br />\nwhere representative government<br />\nprevails. Every citizen in this<br />\nhind has his representative in the<br />\n;Him inistration of his town and of<br />\nhis State and in the Federal<br />\nGovernment itself. If men want<br />\nanything here, they elect as they<br />\nrepresentatives other men who.<br />\nalso want the same thing, and who<br />\npromise to try to secure it. Therefore, we say, you are Misdirecting your energies.

Shall we tell these same<br />\nagitators, who have nominated<br />\ntheir candidates and gotten the<br />\nvoters to elect them, that ballots<br />\nwill no longer avail, and that<br />\nhenceforth bullets will have to be<br />\nemployed?

The only thing necessary,<br />\ntherefore, is to interest the fellows in the next production, and<br />\nif it is possible to secure the backing and co-operation of the students and student organizations<br />\nsuccess will be easy.<br />\nHopkins should go into dramatics more seriously, as suggested by J. 0. L., and take its place<br />\nin the creative art life of Maryland in the same way that Harvard University has its Workshop<br />\nTheatre. The stimulating lectures<br /><br />\ngiven before the members of our<br />\ndramatic talent and the Literary<br />\nClub by Florence Lewis Speare,<br />\ntogether with the interest she is<br />\narousing in this city as president<br />\nof the newly organized Drama<br />\nLeague, merely goes to show how<br />\nquickly and earnestly students<br />\nand citizens respond to any serious movement when the right people are connected with it. Johns<br />\nHopkins has a unique opportunity. South of the Mason and Dixon Line no university has established the laboratory theatre.<br />\nThere is abundant histronic talent among the undergraduate students of the University, and with<br />\nthe valuable training that Miss<br />\nWalter gives us, Johns Hopkins<br />\nought to take a prominent place<br />\nin the student dramatics of the<br />\nEast. With the backing of the<br />\nstudents, this will be easy 'of accomplishment. Think it over, felJ. 0. Ti.,<br />\nlows!<br /><br />\nSir\u2014.l wish to call your attention to a small matter in regard<br />\nto the use of the tennis courts,<br />\nwhich I have frequently observed<br />\nduring the last two weeks. A<br />\ngreat deal of interest has been<br />\nshown in this game recently and,<br />\nconsequently, the courts have<br />\nbeen in great demand. Now, it<br />\nis only fair that all those who<br />\ndesire to play should have a fair<br />\nchance, and this is absolutely impossible when four of five men<br />\nget possession of the courts and<br />\nhold them about four hours at<br />\na time.<br />\nThe other day I noticed two<br />\nfellows who started at 9 o'clock<br />\nin the morning and whom I saw<br />\non the same court every one of<br />\nthe eight times I passed throughout the day. These men played<br />\nat least three hours in the morning and four in the afternoon,<br />\nand then repeatedly refused to<br />\n-double up\" with anyone.<br />\nNearly all clubs possessing<br />\ntennis courts have a written or<br />\nunwritten rule that only the best<br />\ntwo out of three sets may be<br />\nplayed when others are waiting<br />\nto use the courts. I understand<br />\nthat such a rule was formerly<br />\nobserved on our courts, but if it<br />\nis so, it has certainly been forgotten or disregarded by a number<br />\nof students,<br />\nAN<br /><br />\nOBSERVER.<br /><br />\n301<br /><br />\nN.
