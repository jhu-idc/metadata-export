XVI, NO. 8.<br />\n<br />\nMR. BOBBITT OBJECTS<br />\nFounder of the Arbitration Society Protests Against the Proposed Change<br />\nInto a Literary Organization.<br />\n<br />\nFurther discussion of the project<br />\nto change the Arbitration Society<br />\ninto a literary organization is contained in the two letters which follow. The first, from Mr. L. B.<br />\nBobbitt (A. B., 'ii), the organizer<br />\nof the Arbitration Society, endorses<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER'S editorial of<br />\nNovember 13. The second, from<br />\nMr. J. S. Dickinson, the president<br />\nof the Literary Society, attempts to<br />\ncriticize the attitude of THE NEWS-<br />\n<br />\nLETTER.<br />\nNovember 20, 1911.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER :<br />\nDear Sir\u2014Your issue of November 13 informs me that the Johns<br />\nHopkins Arbitration Society has<br />\nresolved to transform itself into<br />\na literary and debating society, and<br />\n.that a committee has been appointed to draft a new constitution. As<br />\nthe organizer and president of the<br />\nArbitration Society last yea,r, I regret exceedingly that this action<br />\nhas been taken. In spite of the<br />\nproposal to devote at least two<br />\nmeetings a year to the discussion<br />\nof matters pertaining to arbitration,<br />\nthis new plan means that the distinctive . character of the Arbitration Society will be lost and that<br />\nthe specific purpose for which it<br />\nwas organized will be frustrated.<br />\nI believed last year, and the sentiment of a number of the students<br />\nconfirmed my belief, that there was<br />\na real place in the University for<br />\na student society that should devote itself primarily to the study<br />\nof the judicial settlement of international disputes, and secondarily,<br />\nto the study of the peace movement<br />\nand international politics in general.<br />\nSo far as I know, the Arbitration<br />\nSociety that some of us formed<br />\nwas the first college society of its /<br />\nkind in the country. For several//<br />\nYears a number of college literary<br />\nsocieties had, perhaps once or twice<br />\na year, presented a program dealing with peace and arbitration; but<br />\nour society was, I think, the first<br />\ncollege society to devote itself to<br />\nthese subjects exclusively. The<br />\nWork that we did, though not very<br />\nelaborate, was of some real value.<br />\nWe held bi-weekly meetings, at<br />\nWhich a number of excellent papers<br />\nWere presented by the members;<br />\nwe were addressed by two prominent men, connected with the peace<br />\nmovement, Hon. James Brown<br />\nScott and Mr. Edwin D. Mead;<br />\nWe arranged the details of the<br />\naryland Oratorical Contest of the<br />\nIntercollegiate.

Huey,<br />\nwho has recently been appointed<br />\nLecturer on Mental Development<br />\nin the University and Assistant in<br />\nthe Phipps Clinic of the Hospital,<br />\nwill give a series of public lectures<br />\non each Saturday that the University is in session, continuing to the<br />\nclose of the university year.<br />\nThe object of the course is, first,<br />\nto present some representative work<br />\nthat is being done in the study and<br />\ntreatment of defective children; second, to make as intelligible as possible, certain psychological conceptions which are currently used in<br />\nthe study of cases.<br />\nAfter a very brief sketch of the<br />\nvaried work with cases in many<br />\nparts of the world, and of the revision of psychology that is inevitably to come from this work, there<br />\nwill be a presentation of the recently-adopted schema of \u2022 classification<br />\nand terminology for the various<br />\ngrades of defectives. The operation of this schema will then be<br />\nillustrated by actual results obtained in handling cases at a large<br />\nState institution. The methods of<br />\nexamining cases and of securing<br />\nthe data needed for a proper casehistory will be illustrated. It is expected that there will be at least<br />\ntwo clinics in which mental examinations of children will be made<br />\nwith the Binet scale. Various types<br />\nof mentally backward children as<br />\nfound in school will be presented.<br />\nThere will, of course, be opportunity for questions, and for such discussion as time may permit.<br />\nBesides these more practical presentations, the course will include<br />\nlectures on the intelligence, the<br />\nemotions and feelings in their relation to mental adaptation, the<br />\ntendencies to automatism, fixation<br />\nand limitation of mental response,<br />\nand the characteristics of infantilism and of various abnormal returns to \"childish things\" by individuals and by society. Certain<br />\nchanges in these topics may be expedient as the course proceeds.<br />\nThere can be relatively more of a<br />\ndiscussion of psychological theory<br />\nif the audience should prefer.<br />\nThe lectures will begin at<br />\no'cl6ck and will last one hour.<br />\nThey will be open to the public as<br />\nwell as to the members of the University. It is hoped' that they may<br />\nrender a service to many who have<br />\nto do with defectives, as well as to<br />\nmany ethers who have.an interest<br />\nin psychology.<br />\n<br />\nDr. John M. T. Finney, associate<br />\nprofessor of surgery in the Johns<br />\nHopkins University issued a statement Friday afternoon in which he<br />\nsaid that he thought that Baltimore<br />\noffered more opportunities for the<br />\nwork which he is fitted to do, than<br />\nwould the presidency of Princeton<br />\nUniversity. Hs formal statement<br />\nfollows:<br />\n\"Owing to the wide publicity<br />\nwhich, unfortunately, has been given<br />\nto the connection of my name with<br />\nthe presidency of Princeton University, it is, perhaps, proper that<br />\nI should state the facts in the case<br />\n,in order that they may not be misunderstood. Sometime ago I was<br />\napproached by members of the<br />\nnominating committee of the Board<br />\nof Trustees of Princeton and asked<br />\nwhether or not I would be willing<br />\nto have them present my name to<br />\nthe Board for election to the presidency of the University.<br />\n\"After most careful consideration,<br />\nfrom every point of view, I felt that<br />\nmy work in Baltimore was not yet<br />\ndone and, therefore, requested that<br />\nmy name should be withdrawn.<br />\nWhile the call from Princeton,<br />\nwhich I consider one of the highest<br />\nhonors that can fall to any man's<br />\nlot, came with peculiar force, it<br />\nseemed best that I should remain in<br />\nBaltimore. I felt that I was better<br />\nfitted for the work which T am now<br />\ndoing.\"<br />\nSophomore-Freshman Game.<br />\nThe annual game of football between the sophomores and the freshmen will be played this coming Saturday, 3 P. M., at Homewood. The<br />\nsophomore class is one of three<br />\nclasses which has won the game in<br />\nits first year at the University. It<br />\ndefeated the Class of 1913 last fall,<br />\n18 to o, but it has lost \"by graduation\" five of its first string men,<br />\nthe Riley brothers, Hill, Schreiber,<br />\nand Bryan. The loss depletes the<br />\nstrength of the team nearly onehalf, but new men have been<br />\nbrought out who will fill the vacancies and try to win again.<br />\nA second victory will give 194<br />\na unique place in class history at<br />\nHopkins, because no other class<br />\nteam has won both games.<br />\nBoth teams will practice regularly<br />\nthis week.<br />\n<br />\nA biography of 'Woodrow Wilson, which is appearing in The<br />\nWorld's Work,' says that while at<br />\nPrinceton, he was managing editor of the student publication, and<br />\nthat he stood fortieth in his class:<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nCARLISLE WINS<br />\nThe Conquerors of Harvard and Pcnn<br />\nDefeat Hopkins in a Spectacular Game<br />\n<br />\nHopkins lost last Saturday by the<br />\nscore of 29 to 6, to the strongest<br />\nfootball team that has represented<br />\nCarlisle in recent years. The Indians<br />\ncame to Baltimore with the record<br />\nof more points scored than any<br />\nother of the big teams of the East.<br />\nThey have lost but one game this<br />\nyear, and that to Syracuse, on a<br />\nmuddy field; Saturday, however, the<br />\nsloppy condition of the field did not<br />\nseem to interfere with the Indians'<br />\ngame, for they relied mostly on<br />\nquick end 'plays. Sousa, who played<br />\nsuch a fine game against Syracuse,<br />\nwas a particularly bright star in<br />\ngetting around the ends.<br />\nThe first ten minutes of the game<br />\nconsisted mainly in the exchange<br />\nof punts. The Hopkins line was<br />\nholding particularly well, and after<br />\na few ineffectual attempts to gain,<br />\nthe Indians would kick. The exchanges made but little difference<br />\nin the relative positions of the team,<br />\nso the Indians began to change<br />\ntheir tactics. It has been noticeable<br />\nthe whole year, how slow the 'Varsity is in getting into place. The<br />\nIndians now took advantage of this<br />\nweakness, and by a quick dash<br />\naround Hopkins' left end, placed<br />\nthe ball near the side lines on the<br />\nHopkins half of the field. Before<br />\nHopkins was settled again, the<br />\nIndians apparently attempted a mass<br />\nplay through their left tackle. Meanwhile the man with the ball rushed<br />\nunhindered along the side line.<br />\nScore, 5 to o.<br />\nShortly after the beginning of<br />\nthe second -quarter, Gillet made a<br />\nkick from Hopkins' 25-yard line.<br />\nIt was short, and Branham seized<br />\nthe ball and got clear, but was<br />\ncaught in mid-field by a swift<br />\nIndian runner. Carlisle soon got possession of the ball and by two long<br />\nend runs, supported by magnificent<br />\n441terference, and two line plunges,<br />\nput the ball over. Score, ii to 0.<br />\nThe third touchdown was made<br />\nwhen Gillet was blocked in an attempt to kick from Hopkins' 25yard line and an Indian recovered<br />\nthe ball. Score, 17 to o.<br />\nThe Indians, receiving possession<br />\nof the ball, tried a forward pass,<br />\nwhich Pieper blocked. After getting the pigskin again on a punt,<br />\nthe Indians made a 30-yard run<br />\nto Hopkins' 25-yard line. Here,<br />\nQuarterback Welch received a pass<br />\nand stood still for a moment as<br />\nif bewildered, then slowly drew the<br />\nball back as if to make a forward<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 3.)<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 27, 1911.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nThe News=Letter<br />\nFOUNDED, 1897.<br />\nSUBSCRIPTION:<br />\n5 cents per copy.<br />\n$1.50 per year.<br />\nEntered<br />\ncember 3,<br />\nBaltimore,<br />\nNovember<br />\n<br />\nas second class matter De1909, at the Post Office at<br />\nMd., under Act of Congress,<br />\n3, 1879.<br />\n<br />\nPublished weekly from October to<br />\nJune by the undergraduates of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nBusiness communications should be<br />\naddressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER;<br />\nall articles and other communications.<br />\nshould be sent to the EniToR-1N-CHIEF.<br />\nTelephone,<br />\n<br />\n- -<br />\n<br />\nMt.

One fundamental principle of true sport is to accept the<br />\noutcome without protest. Such has<br />\nusually been the practice of our<br />\nneighbors from Annapolis, and we<br />\nhonor them for it. On this occasion, too, the St. John's authorities<br />\nand students have shown themselves<br />\nwilling to submit to a defeat at the<br />\nhands of a better team with good<br />\nfeeling, just exactly as Hopkins has<br />\ndone time after time when conditions were reversed; but a number<br />\nof over-zealous alumni and partisans of our rival institution have<br />\nfilled the newspapers with howls<br />\nabout the condition of the Homewood field, the personnel of the<br />\nHopkins team, and various other<br />\nunworthily imagined grievances. To<br />\nthese persons, we do not consider<br />\nit our place ,to reply. The facts<br />\nand conditions in question, which<br />\nhave been brought out in several<br />\nable letters from prominent Hopkins graduates, are an adequate reflection of their somewhat ill-mannered attacks.<br />\nOne public assault, however, was<br />\ntoo flagrant, and delivered in too<br />\nunfair a manner to be passed over.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER must object to<br />\nthe treatment accorded the Hopkins<br />\nfootball team, and athletic authorities, in the account of the HopkinsSt. John's game which appeared in<br />\nThe Sun. We leave the article itself to serve as a bill of particulars<br />\nto substantiate our complaint, and<br />\nare willing to accept the unprejudiced judgment of the spectators of<br />\nthe game as to the unfairness and<br />\ninaccuracy of the statement it contains.<br />\nWe cannot omit reference, also,<br />\nto the weights of the Hopkins plays, that have been published in the<br />\nlocal papers. We regret, exceed-<br />\n<br />\ningly, and we believe the students<br />\nunanimously join in regretting, that<br />\nthe figures given out before the<br />\nWhy not a LEMMERT SUIT this time?<br />\nVirginia game were inaccurate, and<br />\nin one case, that of Morton, twenty<br />\npounds below the actual weight of Made to measure from $18 up to $25, and hundreds<br />\nthe player.

B. Ilollnirr.<br />\nVanderbilt University..<br />\nNovember 14, 1911.<br />\n1'0 the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nI should like to call attention to<br />\na case in which one of the editorials in THE NEWS-LETTER appears to have been founded upon<br />\ni nsufficient knowledge of the subject discussed. In the editorial upon<br />\nt,he \"literary\" society in last week's<br />\nissue, there occurs the following<br />\nstatement: \"The change which has<br />\nbeen made by the members of the<br />\nArbitration Society in deciding that<br />\nthe aim of their organization in the<br />\nfuture shall be of a literary character, is of doubtful wisdom. * * *<br />\nWhat we regret is that the arbitration element of the society has been<br />\nlost.\"<br />\nIn the account of the Arbitration<br />\nSociety's plans as reported three<br />\nPages further on in the very same<br />\nissue this statement occurs: \"Tt is<br />\nProposed that the society shall devote two or. more meetings every<br />\nYear to the discussion of problems<br />\n<br />\nconnected with arbitration and that<br />\nit shall continue to hold the Maryland Intercollegiate Contests in<br />\nOratory under its auspices; but that<br />\nat other times its functions shall be<br />\nthose of a literary and debating<br />\nsociety.\" Thus it will be seen that<br />\nthe arbitration element in the society has not been lost.<br />\nThe experience of the Arbitration<br />\nSociety itself during the past year,<br />\nand the example of most of the<br />\nother peace societies in existence,<br />\nprove beyond contradiction that<br />\nwhen the sphere of interest of an<br />\norganization is limited to a single<br />\nsubject like peace, there is neither<br />\ninterest enough aroused nor action<br />\nenough possible to justify more<br />\nthan a few meetings a year. The<br />\nproblem confronting the officers of<br />\nthe Arbitration Society was, therefore, this: If the Society was to<br />\ncontinue, simply as an arbitration<br />\nsociety, it could hold not more than<br />\ntwo or three meetings a year respectably. Was there any excuse<br />\nfor making it a more permanent<br />\norganization? THE NF;WS-LETTER<br />\nappears to think not, and alleges<br />\nthat there are already quite enough<br />\nstudent societies. Where are they?<br />\nWhat are their names? The Musical Clubs, to be sure, have taken a<br />\nnew lease on life. The Chess Club<br />\nappears to be struggling on after<br />\nsome fashion or other. The Haresfoot Club is dead.<br />\nBut are these societies so very<br />\nnumerous? Or does any one of<br />\nthem compete in the field which<br />\nthe Arbitration Society proposes to<br />\nenter? The officers of the Arbitration Society thought not. They<br />\nbelieved that there was still room<br />\nat Hopkins for an organization<br />\nwhich might bring all the undergraduates together on a common<br />\nfield of social intercourse and intellectual enjoyment; which side by<br />\nside with the pleasures of the<br />\ngridiron might render possible the<br />\npleasures of the forum; but out<br />\nof respect to the founder of thc<br />\nSociety, the increase of peace sentiment, and the progress of the world,<br />\nthey emphatically resolved that the<br />\narbitration element in the Society<br />\nshould be, not lost, but faithfully<br />\npreserved.<br />\n<br />\nJOHN S. DICKINSON.<br />\n<br />\n[The author of this wail neglects to<br />\nm5ption that the editorial in question<br />\nsaid that \"Here at Hopkins we had the<br />\nhonor of having the first arbitration<br />\nsociety at any university in the Southeast.\" College arbitration societies are<br />\nsomeday going to be important factors<br />\nin working for peace. The Intercollegiate Peace Association is trying to organize a society in every college in the<br />\ncountry. One was organized at Hopkins, and its first year was prosperous.<br />\nTHE, NEWS-LETTER doesn't want to<br />\nkeep the author of this letter, or anyone else, from having an opportunity<br />\nto learn how to speak in public. In<br />\norder to accomplish their commendable<br />\npurpose, however, it isn't necessary for<br />\nthe advocates of this new organization<br />\nto destroy the Arbitration Society.\u2014<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nA BUSINESS SCHOOL<br />\nOf Exceptional Merit<br />\n<br />\nR.

Mr. Woo comes from<br />\nChang- Chow Foo, a city of broad<br />\nstreets and fine shops. There, too,<br />\nis a magnificent Buddhist temple,<br />\nbuilt in the eighth century. Last<br />\nMonday's paper said that this city,<br />\nwith its 900,000 inhabitants, was<br />\ntaken by the rebels. Most everyone who could, fled from the city<br />\nbefore the rebels got in, although<br />\nafter the place was taken, no violence, except thievery, occurred.<br />\nMr. Woo is not committing himself on the subject of the present<br />\nrevolution, because, it must be remembered, he is an \"American Indemnity Fund\" student, who was<br />\nsent to America under the Empire.<br />\nIf the rebels gain complete control,<br />\nit is not known whether it will affect Mr. Woo or not. However,<br />\n.the leaders of the rebels are for the<br />\nmost part progressive and foreign<br />\neducated Chinese, and it is expected<br />\nthat not only will the present students remain in America, but that<br />\nincreased numbers will come over<br />\nin the future.<br />\nAbout 700 students have come to<br />\nthis country in the first three years.<br />\nIt is intended to continue sending<br />\nmen until the fund gives out, which<br />\nis calculated to last for thirty years<br />\nmore. The young men are divided<br />\nequally between the Eastern and<br />\nWestern parts of the United States.<br />\nOn our side of the continent, a<br />\ngreat many go to Cornell. Only<br />\ntwo are at Hopkins, Mr. Woo and<br />\nMr. Hsueh-Wu Sun, a special student, who will later take graduate<br />\nwork in chemistry. Mr. Woo says<br />\nthat more men do not come to the<br />\nHopkins Medical School because<br />\nthey are frightened by the high requirements. He, himself, although<br />\npossessing a college degree from a<br />\nmission school, was forced to spend<br />\nlast year in the undergraduate department.<br />\n<br />\nCaptain, J. S.

BOBBITT OBJECTS<br />\nFounder of the Arbitration Society Protests Against the Proposed Change<br />\nInto a Literary Organization.<br /><br />\nFurther discussion of the project<br />\nto change the Arbitration Society<br />\ninto a literary organization is contained in the two letters which follow. The first, from Mr. L. B.<br />\nBobbitt (A. B., 'ii), the organizer<br />\nof the Arbitration Society, endorses<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER'S editorial of<br />\nNovember 13. The second, from<br />\nMr. J. S. Dickinson, the president<br />\nof the Literary Society, attempts to<br />\ncriticize the attitude of THE NEWS-<br /><br />\nLETTER.<br />\nNovember 20, 1911.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER :<br />\nDear Sir\u2014Your issue of November 13 informs me that the Johns<br />\nHopkins Arbitration Society has<br />\nresolved to transform itself into<br />\na literary and debating society, and<br />\n.that a committee has been appointed to draft a new constitution. As<br />\nthe organizer and president of the<br />\nArbitration Society last yea,r, I regret exceedingly that this action<br />\nhas been taken. In spite of the<br />\nproposal to devote at least two<br />\nmeetings a year to the discussion<br />\nof matters pertaining to arbitration,<br />\nthis new plan means that the distinctive . character of the Arbitration Society will be lost and that<br />\nthe specific purpose for which it<br />\nwas organized will be frustrated.<br />\nI believed last year, and the sentiment of a number of the students<br />\nconfirmed my belief, that there was<br />\na real place in the University for<br />\na student society that should devote itself primarily to the study<br />\nof the judicial settlement of international disputes, and secondarily,<br />\nto the study of the peace movement<br />\nand international politics in general.<br />\nSo far as I know, the Arbitration<br />\nSociety that some of us formed<br />\nwas the first college society of its /<br />\nkind in the country. For several//<br />\nYears a number of college literary<br />\nsocieties had, perhaps once or twice<br />\na year, presented a program dealing with peace and arbitration; but<br />\nour society was, I think, the first<br />\ncollege society to devote itself to<br />\nthese subjects exclusively. The<br />\nWork that we did, though not very<br />\nelaborate, was of some real value.<br />\nWe held bi-weekly meetings, at<br />\nWhich a number of excellent papers<br />\nWere presented by the members;<br />\nwe were addressed by two prominent men, connected with the peace<br />\nmovement, Hon. James Brown<br />\nScott and Mr. Edwin D. Mead;<br />\nWe arranged the details of the<br />\naryland Oratorical Contest of the<br />\nIntercollegiate.

FINNEY DECLINES CALL<br /><br />\nCourse Dealing With Defective Children<br />\nWill Begin Early in January,<br />\non Saturday Mornings.<br /><br />\nHopkins Professor Issues Statement Declining to be Considered for<br />\nPresident of Princeton.<br /><br />\nBeginning early in January, at a<br />\ndate to be announced shortly in the<br />\npublic press, Dr. Edmund B. Huey,<br />\nwho has recently been appointed<br />\nLecturer on Mental Development<br />\nin the University and Assistant in<br />\nthe Phipps Clinic of the Hospital,<br />\nwill give a series of public lectures<br />\non each Saturday that the University is in session, continuing to the<br />\nclose of the university year.<br />\nThe object of the course is, first,<br />\nto present some representative work<br />\nthat is being done in the study and<br />\ntreatment of defective children; second, to make as intelligible as possible, certain psychological conceptions which are currently used in<br />\nthe study of cases.<br />\nAfter a very brief sketch of the<br />\nvaried work with cases in many<br />\nparts of the world, and of the revision of psychology that is inevitably to come from this work, there<br />\nwill be a presentation of the recently-adopted schema of \u2022 classification<br />\nand terminology for the various<br />\ngrades of defectives. The operation of this schema will then be<br />\nillustrated by actual results obtained in handling cases at a large<br />\nState institution. The methods of<br />\nexamining cases and of securing<br />\nthe data needed for a proper casehistory will be illustrated. It is expected that there will be at least<br />\ntwo clinics in which mental examinations of children will be made<br />\nwith the Binet scale. Various types<br />\nof mentally backward children as<br />\nfound in school will be presented.<br />\nThere will, of course, be opportunity for questions, and for such discussion as time may permit.<br />\nBesides these more practical presentations, the course will include<br />\nlectures on the intelligence, the<br />\nemotions and feelings in their relation to mental adaptation, the<br />\ntendencies to automatism, fixation<br />\nand limitation of mental response,<br />\nand the characteristics of infantilism and of various abnormal returns to \"childish things\" by individuals and by society. Certain<br />\nchanges in these topics may be expedient as the course proceeds.<br />\nThere can be relatively more of a<br />\ndiscussion of psychological theory<br />\nif the audience should prefer.<br />\nThe lectures will begin at<br />\no'cl6ck and will last one hour.<br />\nThey will be open to the public as<br />\nwell as to the members of the University. It is hoped' that they may<br />\nrender a service to many who have<br />\nto do with defectives, as well as to<br />\nmany ethers who have.an interest<br />\nin psychology.<br /><br />\nDr. John M. T. Finney, associate<br />\nprofessor of surgery in the Johns<br />\nHopkins University issued a statement Friday afternoon in which he<br />\nsaid that he thought that Baltimore<br />\noffered more opportunities for the<br />\nwork which he is fitted to do, than<br />\nwould the presidency of Princeton<br />\nUniversity. Hs formal statement<br />\nfollows:<br />\n\"Owing to the wide publicity<br />\nwhich, unfortunately, has been given<br />\nto the connection of my name with<br />\nthe presidency of Princeton University, it is, perhaps, proper that<br />\nI should state the facts in the case<br />\n,in order that they may not be misunderstood. Sometime ago I was<br />\napproached by members of the<br />\nnominating committee of the Board<br />\nof Trustees of Princeton and asked<br />\nwhether or not I would be willing<br />\nto have them present my name to<br />\nthe Board for election to the presidency of the University.<br />\n\"After most careful consideration,<br />\nfrom every point of view, I felt that<br />\nmy work in Baltimore was not yet<br />\ndone and, therefore, requested that<br />\nmy name should be withdrawn.<br />\nWhile the call from Princeton,<br />\nwhich I consider one of the highest<br />\nhonors that can fall to any man's<br />\nlot, came with peculiar force, it<br />\nseemed best that I should remain in<br />\nBaltimore. I felt that I was better<br />\nfitted for the work which T am now<br />\ndoing.\"<br />\nSophomore-Freshman Game.<br />\nThe annual game of football between the sophomores and the freshmen will be played this coming Saturday, 3 P. M., at Homewood. The<br />\nsophomore class is one of three<br />\nclasses which has won the game in<br />\nits first year at the University. It<br />\ndefeated the Class of 1913 last fall,<br />\n18 to o, but it has lost \"by graduation\" five of its first string men,<br />\nthe Riley brothers, Hill, Schreiber,<br />\nand Bryan. The loss depletes the<br />\nstrength of the team nearly onehalf, but new men have been<br />\nbrought out who will fill the vacancies and try to win again.<br />\nA second victory will give 194<br />\na unique place in class history at<br />\nHopkins, because no other class<br />\nteam has won both games.<br />\nBoth teams will practice regularly<br />\nthis week.<br /><br />\nA biography of 'Woodrow Wilson, which is appearing in The<br />\nWorld's Work,' says that while at<br />\nPrinceton, he was managing editor of the student publication, and<br />\nthat he stood fortieth in his class:<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nCARLISLE WINS<br />\nThe Conquerors of Harvard and Pcnn<br />\nDefeat Hopkins in a Spectacular Game<br /><br />\nHopkins lost last Saturday by the<br />\nscore of 29 to 6, to the strongest<br />\nfootball team that has represented<br />\nCarlisle in recent years. The Indians<br />\ncame to Baltimore with the record<br />\nof more points scored than any<br />\nother of the big teams of the East.<br />\nThey have lost but one game this<br />\nyear, and that to Syracuse, on a<br />\nmuddy field; Saturday, however, the<br />\nsloppy condition of the field did not<br />\nseem to interfere with the Indians'<br />\ngame, for they relied mostly on<br />\nquick end 'plays. Sousa, who played<br />\nsuch a fine game against Syracuse,<br />\nwas a particularly bright star in<br />\ngetting around the ends.<br />\nThe first ten minutes of the game<br />\nconsisted mainly in the exchange<br />\nof punts. The Hopkins line was<br />\nholding particularly well, and after<br />\na few ineffectual attempts to gain,<br />\nthe Indians would kick. The exchanges made but little difference<br />\nin the relative positions of the team,<br />\nso the Indians began to change<br />\ntheir tactics. It has been noticeable<br />\nthe whole year, how slow the 'Varsity is in getting into place. The<br />\nIndians now took advantage of this<br />\nweakness, and by a quick dash<br />\naround Hopkins' left end, placed<br />\nthe ball near the side lines on the<br />\nHopkins half of the field. Before<br />\nHopkins was settled again, the<br />\nIndians apparently attempted a mass<br />\nplay through their left tackle. Meanwhile the man with the ball rushed<br />\nunhindered along the side line.<br />\nScore, 5 to o.<br />\nShortly after the beginning of<br />\nthe second -quarter, Gillet made a<br />\nkick from Hopkins' 25-yard line.<br />\nIt was short, and Branham seized<br />\nthe ball and got clear, but was<br />\ncaught in mid-field by a swift<br />\nIndian runner. Carlisle soon got possession of the ball and by two long<br />\nend runs, supported by magnificent<br />\n441terference, and two line plunges,<br />\nput the ball over. Score, ii to 0.<br />\nThe third touchdown was made<br />\nwhen Gillet was blocked in an attempt to kick from Hopkins' 25yard line and an Indian recovered<br />\nthe ball. Score, 17 to o.<br />\nThe Indians, receiving possession<br />\nof the ball, tried a forward pass,<br />\nwhich Pieper blocked. After getting the pigskin again on a punt,<br />\nthe Indians made a 30-yard run<br />\nto Hopkins' 25-yard line. Here,<br />\nQuarterback Welch received a pass<br />\nand stood still for a moment as<br />\nif bewildered, then slowly drew the<br />\nball back as if to make a forward<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 3.)<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 27, 1911.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nThe News=Letter<br />\nFOUNDED, 1897.<br />\nSUBSCRIPTION:<br />\n5 cents per copy.<br />\n$1.50 per year.<br />\nEntered<br />\ncember 3,<br />\nBaltimore,<br />\nNovember<br /><br />\nas second class matter De1909, at the Post Office at<br />\nMd., under Act of Congress,<br />\n3, 1879.<br /><br />\nPublished weekly from October to<br />\nJune by the undergraduates of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nBusiness communications should be<br />\naddressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER;<br />\nall articles and other communications.<br />\nshould be sent to the EniToR-1N-CHIEF.<br />\nTelephone,<br /><br />\n- -<br /><br />\nMt.

One fundamental principle of true sport is to accept the<br />\noutcome without protest. Such has<br />\nusually been the practice of our<br />\nneighbors from Annapolis, and we<br />\nhonor them for it. On this occasion, too, the St. John's authorities<br />\nand students have shown themselves<br />\nwilling to submit to a defeat at the<br />\nhands of a better team with good<br />\nfeeling, just exactly as Hopkins has<br />\ndone time after time when conditions were reversed; but a number<br />\nof over-zealous alumni and partisans of our rival institution have<br />\nfilled the newspapers with howls<br />\nabout the condition of the Homewood field, the personnel of the<br />\nHopkins team, and various other<br />\nunworthily imagined grievances. To<br />\nthese persons, we do not consider<br />\nit our place ,to reply. The facts<br />\nand conditions in question, which<br />\nhave been brought out in several<br />\nable letters from prominent Hopkins graduates, are an adequate reflection of their somewhat ill-mannered attacks.<br />\nOne public assault, however, was<br />\ntoo flagrant, and delivered in too<br />\nunfair a manner to be passed over.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER must object to<br />\nthe treatment accorded the Hopkins<br />\nfootball team, and athletic authorities, in the account of the HopkinsSt. John's game which appeared in<br />\nThe Sun. We leave the article itself to serve as a bill of particulars<br />\nto substantiate our complaint, and<br />\nare willing to accept the unprejudiced judgment of the spectators of<br />\nthe game as to the unfairness and<br />\ninaccuracy of the statement it contains.<br />\nWe cannot omit reference, also,<br />\nto the weights of the Hopkins plays, that have been published in the<br />\nlocal papers.

In the editorial upon<br />\nt,he \"literary\" society in last week's<br />\nissue, there occurs the following<br />\nstatement: \"The change which has<br />\nbeen made by the members of the<br />\nArbitration Society in deciding that<br />\nthe aim of their organization in the<br />\nfuture shall be of a literary character, is of doubtful wisdom. * * *<br />\nWhat we regret is that the arbitration element of the society has been<br />\nlost.\"<br />\nIn the account of the Arbitration<br />\nSociety's plans as reported three<br />\nPages further on in the very same<br />\nissue this statement occurs: \"Tt is<br />\nProposed that the society shall devote two or. more meetings every<br />\nYear to the discussion of problems<br /><br />\nconnected with arbitration and that<br />\nit shall continue to hold the Maryland Intercollegiate Contests in<br />\nOratory under its auspices; but that<br />\nat other times its functions shall be<br />\nthose of a literary and debating<br />\nsociety.\" Thus it will be seen that<br />\nthe arbitration element in the society has not been lost.<br />\nThe experience of the Arbitration<br />\nSociety itself during the past year,<br />\nand the example of most of the<br />\nother peace societies in existence,<br />\nprove beyond contradiction that<br />\nwhen the sphere of interest of an<br />\norganization is limited to a single<br />\nsubject like peace, there is neither<br />\ninterest enough aroused nor action<br />\nenough possible to justify more<br />\nthan a few meetings a year. The<br />\nproblem confronting the officers of<br />\nthe Arbitration Society was, therefore, this: If the Society was to<br />\ncontinue, simply as an arbitration<br />\nsociety, it could hold not more than<br />\ntwo or three meetings a year respectably. Was there any excuse<br />\nfor making it a more permanent<br />\norganization? THE NF;WS-LETTER<br />\nappears to think not, and alleges<br />\nthat there are already quite enough<br />\nstudent societies. Where are they?<br />\nWhat are their names? The Musical Clubs, to be sure, have taken a<br />\nnew lease on life. The Chess Club<br />\nappears to be struggling on after<br />\nsome fashion or other. The Haresfoot Club is dead.<br />\nBut are these societies so very<br />\nnumerous? Or does any one of<br />\nthem compete in the field which<br />\nthe Arbitration Society proposes to<br />\nenter? The officers of the Arbitration Society thought not. They<br />\nbelieved that there was still room<br />\nat Hopkins for an organization<br />\nwhich might bring all the undergraduates together on a common<br />\nfield of social intercourse and intellectual enjoyment; which side by<br />\nside with the pleasures of the<br />\ngridiron might render possible the<br />\npleasures of the forum; but out<br />\nof respect to the founder of thc<br />\nSociety, the increase of peace sentiment, and the progress of the world,<br />\nthey emphatically resolved that the<br />\narbitration element in the Society<br />\nshould be, not lost, but faithfully<br />\npreserved.<br /><br />\nJOHN S. DICKINSON.<br /><br />\n[The author of this wail neglects to<br />\nm5ption that the editorial in question<br />\nsaid that \"Here at Hopkins we had the<br />\nhonor of having the first arbitration<br />\nsociety at any university in the Southeast.\" College arbitration societies are<br />\nsomeday going to be important factors<br />\nin working for peace. The Intercollegiate Peace Association is trying to organize a society in every college in the<br />\ncountry. One was organized at Hopkins, and its first year was prosperous.<br />\nTHE, NEWS-LETTER doesn't want to<br />\nkeep the author of this letter, or anyone else, from having an opportunity<br />\nto learn how to speak in public. In<br />\norder to accomplish their commendable<br />\npurpose, however, it isn't necessary for<br />\nthe advocates of this new organization<br />\nto destroy the Arbitration Society.\u2014<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nA BUSINESS SCHOOL<br />\nOf Exceptional Merit<br /><br />\nR.

Mr. Woo comes from<br />\nChang- Chow Foo, a city of broad<br />\nstreets and fine shops. There, too,<br />\nis a magnificent Buddhist temple,<br />\nbuilt in the eighth century. Last<br />\nMonday's paper said that this city,<br />\nwith its 900,000 inhabitants, was<br />\ntaken by the rebels. Most everyone who could, fled from the city<br />\nbefore the rebels got in, although<br />\nafter the place was taken, no violence, except thievery, occurred.<br />\nMr. Woo is not committing himself on the subject of the present<br />\nrevolution, because, it must be remembered, he is an \"American Indemnity Fund\" student, who was<br />\nsent to America under the Empire.<br />\nIf the rebels gain complete control,<br />\nit is not known whether it will affect Mr. Woo or not. However,<br />\n.the leaders of the rebels are for the<br />\nmost part progressive and foreign<br />\neducated Chinese, and it is expected<br />\nthat not only will the present students remain in America, but that<br />\nincreased numbers will come over<br />\nin the future.<br />\nAbout 700 students have come to<br />\nthis country in the first three years.<br />\nIt is intended to continue sending<br />\nmen until the fund gives out, which<br />\nis calculated to last for thirty years<br />\nmore. The young men are divided<br />\nequally between the Eastern and<br />\nWestern parts of the United States.<br />\nOn our side of the continent, a<br />\ngreat many go to Cornell. Only<br />\ntwo are at Hopkins, Mr. Woo and<br />\nMr. Hsueh-Wu Sun, a special student, who will later take graduate<br />\nwork in chemistry. Mr. Woo says<br />\nthat more men do not come to the<br />\nHopkins Medical School because<br />\nthey are frightened by the high requirements. He, himself, although<br />\npossessing a college degree from a<br />\nmission school, was forced to spend<br />\nlast year in the undergraduate department.<br /><br />\nCaptain, J. S.
