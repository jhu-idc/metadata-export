The Student Council is<br />\nevidently of somewhat the same<br />\nopinion itself, as an inspection of<br />\nthe more recent regulations will reveal.<br />\nThe object of any system of student control should be to bring before the student body the real value<br />\nof always conducting themselves in<br />\na straightforward, gentlemanly<br />\nfashion. This is, obviously, best<br />\naccomplished with an honor system; but in providing the necessary<br />\nenforcement measures it should be<br />\nborne in mind that a too severe penalty for violations will, in the end,<br />\ndefeat the very purpose of the system, because it will lead toward a<br />\nsuppression, rather than a correction, of dishonest practices. Also,<br />\ntoo strict a penalty plan will tend to<br />\nmake fellow students loathe to report offenders.<br />\nWe believe that the present system at Hopkins leans too much toward such a \"strong arm\" method<br />\nof enforcement. A somewhat more<br />\nlenient and more well defined system of penalties would, in our opinion, result in a much more satisfactory operation of the Honor System.<br />\nJust because a student has cheated<br />\nonce in his career is no indication<br />\nthat he is inherently dishonest and<br />\na single moderately severe penalty<br />\nwill often serve to bring a first ofhas moved eastward.

The Student Council is<br />\nevidently of somewhat the same<br />\nopinion itself, as an inspection of<br />\nthe more recent regulations will reveal.<br />\nThe object of any system of student control should be to bring before the student body the real value<br />\nof always conducting themselves in<br />\na straightforward, gentlemanly<br />\nfashion. This is, obviously, best<br />\naccomplished with an honor system; but in providing the necessary<br />\nenforcement measures it should be<br />\nborne in mind that a too severe penalty for violations will, in the end,<br />\ndefeat the very purpose of the system, because it will lead toward a<br />\nsuppression, rather than a correction, of dishonest practices. Also,<br />\ntoo strict a penalty plan will tend to<br />\nmake fellow students loathe to report offenders.<br />\nWe believe that the present system at Hopkins leans too much toward such a \"strong arm\" method<br />\nof enforcement. A somewhat more<br />\nlenient and more well defined system of penalties would, in our opinion, result in a much more satisfactory operation of the Honor System.<br />\nJust because a student has cheated<br />\nonce in his career is no indication<br />\nthat he is inherently dishonest and<br />\na single moderately severe penalty<br />\nwill often serve to bring a first ofhas moved eastward.
