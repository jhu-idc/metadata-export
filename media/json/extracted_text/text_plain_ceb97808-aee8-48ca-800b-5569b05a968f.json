The members of each group, at least on the<br />\nundergraduate level, tend to regard the other with indifference if not with disdain. Yet, in spite of the obviously<br />\ngreat disparity between the sort of education which<br />\naccompanies a B.A. and that which leads to a Bachelor<br />\nof Engineering Science, there are fundamental similari- ties in educational approach which are too often overlooked.<br />\nThe barrage of publicity which heralds the fiftieth<br />\nanniversary of the School of Engineering Science serves<br />\nto point out an approach to education which is very<br />\nmuch like that of the Faculty of Philosophy, and perhaps<br />\npeculiar to Johns Hopkins. In short, the emphasis is on<br />\na thorough grounding in an intellectual method rather<br />\nthan on the teaching of pragmatic skills or the accumulation of useful data. Phenomena in and for themselves<br />\nare less important than the analysis of the abstract principles, the general rules, which underlie them.<br />\nThis non-pragmatic approach is stressed over and<br />\nover in the publications of the Engineering School. It<br />\nexplains the unusually intense courses in the theoretical<br />\naspects of his field to which the Hopkins Engineer is<br />\nsubjected. It is also undoubtedly a major factor in determining the high proportion of Engineers who take<br />\nadvanced degrees; such an orientation is far more likely<br />\nto produce scholars and teachers than to prepare skilled<br />\npractitioners. All of this is to a large extent parallel to<br />\nthe way the majority of courses are taught in the liberal<br />\narts and \"pure\" sciences. Once more the emphasis is<br />\nless on factual data than on the causes, be they social,<br />\npolitical, or metaphysical which underlie specific literary<br />\nor historial manifestations. Again it is the abstract which<br />\nis stressed, and again the result is to train scholars and<br />\nteachers.<br />\nIn ignoring this unifying concept in the educational<br />\nphilosophies of the two major divisions of Hopkins most<br />\npeople miss the fact that there does seem to be some<br />\norder, some general direction, in the apparently offhand<br />\nteaching of undergraduates here.<br />\n<br />\nThe Dance Band Won't<br />\nSfop Here Any More<br />\nThe policy of the athletic department and the plant<br />\nmanager's office regarding the use of the gym floor has<br />\napparently limited all future dances at Homewood to the<br />\nsock hop variety and has, in effect, forced organizations<br />\nwishing to utilize the gym for dances to sustain heavy<br />\nfinancial losses.<br />\nFor an organization to obtain the gymnasium, it<br />\nmust pay exorbitant fees to buy paper to cover the gym<br />\nfloor in order to insure that it will not be damaged.<br />\nWhile an organization has always had to pay for janitorial services, as well as for tables, chairs and decorations<br />\nwhen preparing the gym for a dance, it will now have<br />\nto pay for floor covering as well.<br />\nThe DSRC-sponsored Pajama Ball would have<br />\nmade money had there been no fee for the gym floor.<br />\nWhile this fee, which amounts to approximately $125<br />\nhas yet to be paid, it will account for the difference<br />\nbetween profit or loss on the dance. Since the PJ Ball<br />\nhad a heavy turnout, its case can be assumed to be<br />\ntypical.<br />\nTo add to the plight of organizations wishing to<br />\nsponsor dances, Mr. Turner has recently stated that no<br />\nhigh heels may be worn at the next dance in his effort<br />\nto determine the amount of damage \"spikes\" cause. Mr.<br />\nTurner adds, however, that he is interested in experimenting with a set of rules and regulations which will<br />\nremain in flux for the next two years when the addition<br />\nto the gymnasium will be completed and a uniform<br />\nflooring available.<br />\nMr. Turner's efforts to create human factors out of<br />\nwould-be dancers will in the end result in no human<br />\nfactors at all. For, if organizations cannot profit from<br />\ndances, they will cease to sponsor them. Mr. Turner's<br />\neffort to prevent would-be damage can gain little sympathy from the undergraduate viewpoint. If the gym is<br />\nreally a recreation center, as he would like to call it,<br />\nit must function as such. In the long run the gym will<br />\nmore than likely be used for dances as it has been in<br />\nthe past. In Mr. Turner's effort to prevent jts disuse,<br />\nhe is preventing any normal utilization of it.<br />\n<br />\nRushin' Discussion<br />\n<br />\nIndependent Views Frats;<br />\nGreek Praises Continuity<br />\nIn recognition of the importance of the decision pendent as well as a fraternity member to present<br />\nfacing each member of the Freshman class with<br />\ntheir views on the advantages and disadvantages<br />\nrespect to whether he will choose to join a<br />\nfraternity, the 1Vews-Letter has asked an inde- of fraternity membership.<br />\n<br />\n-Con-<br />\n<br />\n-Pro-<br />\n<br />\nThose who haven't joined a<br />\nFraternities belong to a genfraternity are generally known eral class of groups which inas \"independents.\" I am one of clude families,<br />\nand, surprisingly<br />\nthem, and largely for the followenough,<br />\ngroups.

Fraternities sponsor students are socialized into the<br />\naffairs that sometimes get out norms of academic success. Fraof hand and, while this may not ternities accomplish this function<br />\nbe the rule, drunken parties are for universities where other<br />\nnot uncommon.<br />\ngroups such as families cannot.<br />\nIndepedents are just what the<br />\nword connotates: they are on<br />\ntheir own socially. Their extracurricular activities are not<br />\nscheduled, and they may spend<br />\ntheir time and money as they<br />\nplease.<br />\nNo Difficulties<br />\nI have not found it difficult<br />\nto find friends. I enjoy the privilege of picking my own, and am<br />\nnot subject to antagonism from<br />\nsocially segregated groups. MY<br />\nsocial life is not static.<br />\nThe intramural athletic program for independents at Hopkins is adequate, although it<br />\ncould be better. There are independent football, basketball, lacrosse and softball leagues, each<br />\nof which have full and wellorganized schedules.<br />\nIt is possible that the reason<br />\nI have found non-fraternity<br />\nmembership not to be a disadvantage is because I am an<br />\nin-town students. Those students<br />\nwho are newcomers to Baltimore<br />\nmight well profit from membership in a Hopkins fraternity.<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nThey do so by encouraging<br />\ncompetition among themselves<br />\non the basis of the plurality of<br />\nvalues relevant to the university<br />\nsystem. Thus, marks of prestige<br />\namong different fraternal units<br />\nare good aggregate academic averages, conspicuous success of<br />\nmembers in intramurals, athletics, extracurricular activities,<br />\netc. Those who would condemn<br />\nfraternities for inhibiting success<br />\nin these respects should observe<br />\nthe mechanisms by which frater-<br />\n<br />\nnities transform the demands of<br />\nthe student role into group goals.<br />\nCertain Disadvantages<br />\nThere is, of course, a certain<br />\ninvidious potential inherent in<br />\nthe multiplicity of criteria by<br />\nwhich fraternities maintain their<br />\ndistirxtness. Rather than encourage competition for status<br />\nbetween individuals, however,<br />\nfraternities retain the communal<br />\nquality of shared activity.<br />\nThis means that fraternity<br />\nbrothers are more than friends.<br />\nFriendship consists in a continuing affluence of shared, personal divulgences, but it does not<br />\ndepend upon sharing a common<br />\nrelationship to a group. Fraternity is always a group relationship. The members of the group<br />\nmay be friends, but they are always brothers.<br />\nFills Up Gaps<br />\nThe significance of this kind<br />\nof relationship lies in its ability<br />\nto handle functions that cannot<br />\nbe handled by any other kind<br />\nof relationship. Students acquire<br />\nfeelings of continuity, of participation in the larger society, by<br />\ntheir fraternal involvement and<br />\nthereby avoid the possibility<br />\nthat their intellectual orientations will result in alienation<br />\nand negativism. Transition to the<br />\nresponsibilities and expectations<br />\nof the adult role becomes less<br />\ncataclysmic, more gradual.<br />\nIn other respects, more immediately apparent, fraternities are<br />\nsocially oriented; in this they are<br />\nnecessary outlets not provided<br />\nby universities. They also cost<br />\nmoney\u2014but what doesn't? And<br />\nwhat would be a better or less<br />\nlucrative social investment?<br />\n<br />\nea44eSpaidence<br />\nIntegration Appeal<br />\nThe following is an open letter<br />\nsent to the Hopkins Student<br />\nCouncil by the members of the<br />\nHopkins chapter of Students for<br />\na Democratic Society.<br />\nGentlemen:<br />\nYou are undoubtedly aware of<br />\nthe \"stand in\" demonstration<br />\nbeing staged by the students of<br />\n<br />\nMorgan State College in protest<br />\nagainst the segregation policy of<br />\nthe Northwood Theatre. For a<br />\nnumber of years a small group<br />\nof Morgan students have urged<br />\nthe integration of this theatre<br />\nlocated only a few blocks from<br />\ntheir campus. Now we are witnessing a sudden and nearly<br />\nunanimous wave of protest on<br />\nthe part of Morgan students.<br />\nThe movement is headed by the<br />\nPresident of the Morgan student<br />\ngovernment and enjoys overwhelming support of that campus. About 200 students have<br />\nalready been arrested, but their<br />\nleaders are determined to continue the movement until the<br />\ntheatre is either integrated or<br />\nforced out of business.<br />\n<br />\nIf these students are to be<br />\nsuccessful in achieving their<br />\nmodest demands to be treated<br />\nwith the equality to which they<br />\nare entitled as American citizens,<br />\nthey will need the support and<br />\nsympathy of the Baltimore community. Above all, they need the<br />\nunqualified backing of other students in the Baltimore area. Aid<br />\nwill, of course, be offered by<br />\nHopkins students as individuals.<br />\nBut beyond this a forthright<br />\ndeclaration in support of the<br />\ndemonstration by the Hopkins<br />\nstudent government would do<br />\nmuch to show the citizens of Bal..<br />\ntimore and Maryland that Mor-i<br />\ncan Dream directed by Lester gan<br />\nstudents do not stand alone.<br />\nWolf and starring Barbara<br />\nyou know, student governAs<br />\nBrown and Arthur Unger will be<br />\nproduced in the barn on Friday, ments have often been characSaturday, and Sunday, both this terized as bodies dedicated tO<br />\n<br />\nRuth Lawson Walsh and Jim<br />\nFowke appear in a scene from<br />\nThe Death of Bessie Smith written by Edward Albee and directed<br />\nby Frances Cary Bowen.

The members of each group, at least on the<br />\nundergraduate level, tend to regard the other with indifference if not with disdain. Yet, in spite of the obviously<br />\ngreat disparity between the sort of education which<br />\naccompanies a B.A. and that which leads to a Bachelor<br />\nof Engineering Science, there are fundamental similari- ties in educational approach which are too often overlooked.<br />\nThe barrage of publicity which heralds the fiftieth<br />\nanniversary of the School of Engineering Science serves<br />\nto point out an approach to education which is very<br />\nmuch like that of the Faculty of Philosophy, and perhaps<br />\npeculiar to Johns Hopkins. In short, the emphasis is on<br />\na thorough grounding in an intellectual method rather<br />\nthan on the teaching of pragmatic skills or the accumulation of useful data. Phenomena in and for themselves<br />\nare less important than the analysis of the abstract principles, the general rules, which underlie them.<br />\nThis non-pragmatic approach is stressed over and<br />\nover in the publications of the Engineering School. It<br />\nexplains the unusually intense courses in the theoretical<br />\naspects of his field to which the Hopkins Engineer is<br />\nsubjected. It is also undoubtedly a major factor in determining the high proportion of Engineers who take<br />\nadvanced degrees; such an orientation is far more likely<br />\nto produce scholars and teachers than to prepare skilled<br />\npractitioners. All of this is to a large extent parallel to<br />\nthe way the majority of courses are taught in the liberal<br />\narts and \"pure\" sciences. Once more the emphasis is<br />\nless on factual data than on the causes, be they social,<br />\npolitical, or metaphysical which underlie specific literary<br />\nor historial manifestations. Again it is the abstract which<br />\nis stressed, and again the result is to train scholars and<br />\nteachers.<br />\nIn ignoring this unifying concept in the educational<br />\nphilosophies of the two major divisions of Hopkins most<br />\npeople miss the fact that there does seem to be some<br />\norder, some general direction, in the apparently offhand<br />\nteaching of undergraduates here.<br /><br />\nThe Dance Band Won't<br />\nSfop Here Any More<br />\nThe policy of the athletic department and the plant<br />\nmanager's office regarding the use of the gym floor has<br />\napparently limited all future dances at Homewood to the<br />\nsock hop variety and has, in effect, forced organizations<br />\nwishing to utilize the gym for dances to sustain heavy<br />\nfinancial losses.<br />\nFor an organization to obtain the gymnasium, it<br />\nmust pay exorbitant fees to buy paper to cover the gym<br />\nfloor in order to insure that it will not be damaged.<br />\nWhile an organization has always had to pay for janitorial services, as well as for tables, chairs and decorations<br />\nwhen preparing the gym for a dance, it will now have<br />\nto pay for floor covering as well.<br />\nThe DSRC-sponsored Pajama Ball would have<br />\nmade money had there been no fee for the gym floor.<br />\nWhile this fee, which amounts to approximately $125<br />\nhas yet to be paid, it will account for the difference<br />\nbetween profit or loss on the dance. Since the PJ Ball<br />\nhad a heavy turnout, its case can be assumed to be<br />\ntypical.<br />\nTo add to the plight of organizations wishing to<br />\nsponsor dances, Mr. Turner has recently stated that no<br />\nhigh heels may be worn at the next dance in his effort<br />\nto determine the amount of damage \"spikes\" cause. Mr.<br />\nTurner adds, however, that he is interested in experimenting with a set of rules and regulations which will<br />\nremain in flux for the next two years when the addition<br />\nto the gymnasium will be completed and a uniform<br />\nflooring available.<br />\nMr. Turner's efforts to create human factors out of<br />\nwould-be dancers will in the end result in no human<br />\nfactors at all. For, if organizations cannot profit from<br />\ndances, they will cease to sponsor them. Mr. Turner's<br />\neffort to prevent would-be damage can gain little sympathy from the undergraduate viewpoint. If the gym is<br />\nreally a recreation center, as he would like to call it,<br />\nit must function as such. In the long run the gym will<br />\nmore than likely be used for dances as it has been in<br />\nthe past. In Mr. Turner's effort to prevent jts disuse,<br />\nhe is preventing any normal utilization of it.<br /><br />\nRushin' Discussion<br /><br />\nIndependent Views Frats;<br />\nGreek Praises Continuity<br />\nIn recognition of the importance of the decision pendent as well as a fraternity member to present<br />\nfacing each member of the Freshman class with<br />\ntheir views on the advantages and disadvantages<br />\nrespect to whether he will choose to join a<br />\nfraternity, the 1Vews-Letter has asked an inde- of fraternity membership.<br /><br />\n-Con-<br /><br />\n-Pro-<br /><br />\nThose who haven't joined a<br />\nFraternities belong to a genfraternity are generally known eral class of groups which inas \"independents.\" I am one of clude families,<br />\nand, surprisingly<br />\nthem, and largely for the followenough,<br />\ngroups. Why?<br />\nideological<br />\ning reasons:<br />\nBecause in all of these groups<br />\nI decided that fraternity memone another in<br />\nbership would take up too much people relate to<br />\nquality<br />\nof their<br />\nthe<br />\nterms<br />\nof<br />\nespecially<br />\nwhen<br />\nI<br />\ntime,<br />\nof my<br />\nneeded it most for studying and common and exclusive group aladapting to the college routine, legiance.

A meeting every bership itself and in placing a<br />\nThursday night, I concluded, high valuation upon the norms<br />\nmight become more a burden<br />\nof solidarity. The implications of<br />\nthan recreation.<br />\nsolidarity are numerous. In comI discovered from friends of menting upon some of them here,<br />\nmine who were or had been in perhaps we can convey a notion<br />\nfraternities that dues were ex- of some of the qualities of fracessive, not to mention inciden- ternal relations.<br />\ntal fees for unscheduled parties,<br />\nComplement Life<br />\netc.<br />\nThat fraternities perf or m<br />\nExclusive Membership<br />\nfunctions which complement the<br />\nFraternities at Hopkins are too<br />\nintellectual milieu of the univeroften closed to \"exclusive\" mem- sity system is a fact documented<br />\nbership.<br />\nabundantly in the history of uniPerhaps most important\u201e the versities. Wherever universities<br />\nimpression that the fraternity exist, they are supported socially<br />\nman gives today is frequently not by a system of groups in which<br />\na good one. Fraternities sponsor students are socialized into the<br />\naffairs that sometimes get out norms of academic success. Fraof hand and, while this may not ternities accomplish this function<br />\nbe the rule, drunken parties are for universities where other<br />\nnot uncommon.<br />\ngroups such as families cannot.<br />\nIndepedents are just what the<br />\nword connotates: they are on<br />\ntheir own socially. Their extracurricular activities are not<br />\nscheduled, and they may spend<br />\ntheir time and money as they<br />\nplease.<br />\nNo Difficulties<br />\nI have not found it difficult<br />\nto find friends. I enjoy the privilege of picking my own, and am<br />\nnot subject to antagonism from<br />\nsocially segregated groups. MY<br />\nsocial life is not static.<br />\nThe intramural athletic program for independents at Hopkins is adequate, although it<br />\ncould be better. There are independent football, basketball, lacrosse and softball leagues, each<br />\nof which have full and wellorganized schedules.<br />\nIt is possible that the reason<br />\nI have found non-fraternity<br />\nmembership not to be a disadvantage is because I am an<br />\nin-town students. Those students<br />\nwho are newcomers to Baltimore<br />\nmight well profit from membership in a Hopkins fraternity.<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nThey do so by encouraging<br />\ncompetition among themselves<br />\non the basis of the plurality of<br />\nvalues relevant to the university<br />\nsystem. Thus, marks of prestige<br />\namong different fraternal units<br />\nare good aggregate academic averages, conspicuous success of<br />\nmembers in intramurals, athletics, extracurricular activities,<br />\netc. Those who would condemn<br />\nfraternities for inhibiting success<br />\nin these respects should observe<br />\nthe mechanisms by which frater-<br /><br />\nnities transform the demands of<br />\nthe student role into group goals.<br />\nCertain Disadvantages<br />\nThere is, of course, a certain<br />\ninvidious potential inherent in<br />\nthe multiplicity of criteria by<br />\nwhich fraternities maintain their<br />\ndistirxtness. Rather than encourage competition for status<br />\nbetween individuals, however,<br />\nfraternities retain the communal<br />\nquality of shared activity.<br />\nThis means that fraternity<br />\nbrothers are more than friends.<br />\nFriendship consists in a continuing affluence of shared, personal divulgences, but it does not<br />\ndepend upon sharing a common<br />\nrelationship to a group. Fraternity is always a group relationship. The members of the group<br />\nmay be friends, but they are always brothers.<br />\nFills Up Gaps<br />\nThe significance of this kind<br />\nof relationship lies in its ability<br />\nto handle functions that cannot<br />\nbe handled by any other kind<br />\nof relationship. Students acquire<br />\nfeelings of continuity, of participation in the larger society, by<br />\ntheir fraternal involvement and<br />\nthereby avoid the possibility<br />\nthat their intellectual orientations will result in alienation<br />\nand negativism. Transition to the<br />\nresponsibilities and expectations<br />\nof the adult role becomes less<br />\ncataclysmic, more gradual.<br />\nIn other respects, more immediately apparent, fraternities are<br />\nsocially oriented; in this they are<br />\nnecessary outlets not provided<br />\nby universities. They also cost<br />\nmoney\u2014but what doesn't? And<br />\nwhat would be a better or less<br />\nlucrative social investment?<br /><br />\nea44eSpaidence<br />\nIntegration Appeal<br />\nThe following is an open letter<br />\nsent to the Hopkins Student<br />\nCouncil by the members of the<br />\nHopkins chapter of Students for<br />\na Democratic Society.<br />\nGentlemen:<br />\nYou are undoubtedly aware of<br />\nthe \"stand in\" demonstration<br />\nbeing staged by the students of<br /><br />\nMorgan State College in protest<br />\nagainst the segregation policy of<br />\nthe Northwood Theatre. For a<br />\nnumber of years a small group<br />\nof Morgan students have urged<br />\nthe integration of this theatre<br />\nlocated only a few blocks from<br />\ntheir campus. Now we are witnessing a sudden and nearly<br />\nunanimous wave of protest on<br />\nthe part of Morgan students.<br />\nThe movement is headed by the<br />\nPresident of the Morgan student<br />\ngovernment and enjoys overwhelming support of that campus. About 200 students have<br />\nalready been arrested, but their<br />\nleaders are determined to continue the movement until the<br />\ntheatre is either integrated or<br />\nforced out of business.<br /><br />\nIf these students are to be<br />\nsuccessful in achieving their<br />\nmodest demands to be treated<br />\nwith the equality to which they<br />\nare entitled as American citizens,<br />\nthey will need the support and<br />\nsympathy of the Baltimore community.
