The Freshman and Junior banquets have always<br />\nbeen enjoyable to all concerned. Especially the Freshman banquet.<br />\n*<br />\n111<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBut we would council those interested against interfering too much<br />\n*<br />\n40t.<br />\nwith the routine of the University work. It has always been a<br />\nV<br />\nsource of pride and should always be, that this University is less<br />\nVIVVVV WV**<br />\naddicted to certain childish pleasures than any other. It should be<br />\ntIVIVV\u2022<br />\n'COST*,<br />\nremembered by those undergraduates who are so clamorous for Home111<br />\n'<br />\nwood that their cause is not helped by instilling into the average<br />\ncitizen the erroneous idea that Hopkins is a kindergarten and Baltimore its play-ground. The<br />\nnewspapers are only too ready to garble facts to make interesting reading. What we mean is<br />\nthat just as good a time can be had without disturbing the peace of the town and the University.<br />\n111<br />\ntIPROV<br />\nVII6VIAV<br />\n110VVV, .<br />\n.<br />\n1.1.1<br />\nV \u2022<br />\n<br />\nAYS the Princeton man; \"And do you have a good time at Hopkins?\"<br />\nThen in a pitying way he tells great tales of things that he and his<br />\nfriends do at Princeton. Now laying aside the matter of what really<br />\nis a good time and whether the Princeton idea of a good time is the<br />\ncorrect one, we would suggest that it is possible to have as good a time<br />\nqV, at Hopkins as at any other place for the following reasons.<br />\nV<br />\nFirst\u2014That a man's friends are the source of his greatest<br />\n11. :VVVVVVVVVI:<br />\npleasure.<br />\nV V<br />\n11<br />\n.<br />\nV(*VW<br />\nSecond\u2014That a small college is more conducive to friendship.<br />\nNV'LAITY<br />\nThird\u2014That Baltimore possesses advantages for a good time<br />\nwhich a mere college town does not. Johns Hopkins has always had a considerable number<br />\nof the nicest fellows one could meet. At least there are as many as anyone could know well<br />\nat any college. Moreover the spirit of southern hospitality is so strong, that having made<br />\nyour friends, you will find Baltimore the most enjoyable place in the country. We are not<br />\n<br />\n;<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nsaying that every man who comes to Hopkins will have this fortune, but he will if he<br />\ndeserves it.<br />\nThe writer has heard many men in Princeton say: \"There is not a thing to do all<br />\nwinter after the football season. You have to go to New York or Philadelphia to have a good<br />\ntime.\" Now the things which one can do in those towns can be done in Baltimore at any<br />\ntime and with less demoralizing effect on the individual and the institution. The theatres, the<br />\nlibraries, the social life are all here to be used by anyone who is eligible. And after a week<br />\nin town what is more refreshing than a week end in the country. The point we would<br />\nemphasize is, that anyone with the ability to make friends is able to have at his command a<br />\nbetter time here than anywhere else. If he has not the qualifications for making the right<br />\nsort of friends, he will have a pretty poor time where ever he goes.<br />\n<br />\nN Saturday, January 19, 1907, Sargent's great picure \"The Four<br />\nDoctors\" was unveiled. To quote from a leader in the Baltimore<br />\nNews, \"The four men, who were the original members of the Faculty<br />\nof Medicine of Johns Hopkins University, and whose eminence, each<br />\nin his own field was the chief source of great distinction which that<br />\npart of the University attained almost immediately upon its foundation will be commemorated forever in a notable work of art.\"<br />\nWhether this picture is the greatest work of Sargent or no, it<br />\nis is enough to say that it is the work of the artist's mature years<br />\nwhen his discernment is at its best and his mastery of technique<br />\nfacile. They are few who will not accord to the American cosmopolite, the title of the greatest living portrait painter.<br />\nSargent has ever been noted among artists as one \"who paints the thing as he sees it<br />\nfor the God of things as they are.\" Women of fashion have winced under his treatment, and<br />\nso have men of distinction, but the man who is really great has nothing to fear in his hands,<br />\nfor Sargent tells the truth.<br />\nIt is singularly felicitous, then, that the University, whose motto<br />\nVeritas Vos Liberabit\"<br />\nhas been most scrupulously acted on, should have in its archives so accurate and so truthful<br />\na record of its great men.<br />\nThis picture may lead to the addition of others but should it not, the influence, be it<br />\nunconscious, will be great. The wonderful composition, the admirable brush work, the<br />\naccurate draughtsmanship, can not help but be an inspiration to all.<br />\n<br />\nWHY?<br />\n<br />\nAnd one she spins, and the second winds,<br />\nAnd the third she flings the spool<br />\n<br />\nThree women sit at the end of the world<br />\nOn a mountain wondrous high.<br />\n<br />\nAnd little it matters where it lights\u2014<br />\nThe thread the wise or the fool.<br />\n<br />\nAnd they spin the while and sing and smile<br />\nAs they cast the bobbins out of the sky.<br />\n<br />\nAnd the string is strung with tears and fears,<br />\n<br />\nThey spin the span of every man<br />\n<br />\nWith paltry glitter too,<br />\n<br />\nThey weave the woof of life<br />\n<br />\nAnd fall as it may there all unwinds<br />\n<br />\nAnd all they wind for poor mankind<br />\n<br />\nWhat the women wound in the clue.<br />\n\u2014J. M. B.<br />\n<br />\nContains its full of fault and strife.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nTHE SOMBRE CARD.<br />\nI.<br />\nIt is a country side of great holdings and<br />\nlarge houses. The hills are covered with forests of primeval timber. From little clefts in<br />\nthe rock, little springs bubble and boil out,<br />\nthence fall in small cascades down into little<br />\nverdant valleys, and as the brooks grow they<br />\njoin and flow into the great river of the Ohio.<br />\nMany of the houses are quite old and the<br />\nfamilies have held them for somewhat over a<br />\nhundred years\u2014a great space of time in the<br />\nWest.<br />\nSince I was born I have spent much time<br />\nin one of these formless, massive, houses with<br />\nmany wings, great chimneys and high walls<br />\nsurrounding old fashioned gardens and moribund orchards.<br />\nIn one of the long summer afternoons of<br />\nAugust when I was quite a child I accumulated my dearest possessions: a copy of the<br />\nCount of Monte Christo, a supply of cornsilk,<br />\nmatches and cigarrette papers, and a stick<br />\nwith a nail in the end sharpened for use in<br />\nspearing frogs.<br />\nI stole out through the garden all fragrant<br />\nwith currant and gooseberry odors, fallen rose<br />\nleaves and pungent with poppies. Past the<br />\nsage, the feathered asparagus spotted with<br />\nred berries, a drink at the spring-house and<br />\nthen I plunged into the willows, a cool retreat<br />\nfrom the glare of the sun.<br />\nFor an hour I amused myself with the cornsilk cigarettes and the Count of Monte Christo<br />\nand then I began to wonder if somewhere on<br />\nthe place there might not be a treasure cave,<br />\nunderground passages or the like, at least a<br />\nghost.<br />\nAfter reflecting, I remembered that the only<br />\nromantic thing in the neighborhood which<br />\nwas available was the oecupant of the<br />\n\"Sombre Gard.\"<br />\nAbout ten years before on a Good Friday a<br />\nyoung man had appeared in the quiet neighborhood. He had all the ear marks of a<br />\ngentleman. His clothes were black and carefully pressed, his hair was light, his eyes<br />\nwere green and the long lashes gave him the<br />\nair of being able to look at the surrounding<br />\nworld without in the least betraying what he<br />\nthought, and at the same time withdrawing<br />\n<br />\nhimself from view. He gave no cause for his<br />\ncoming, answered all questions without any<br />\ninformation as to his past escaping his lips.<br />\nIn his bearing he was intensely reserved\u2014a<br />\nhauteur with the graces of a man of the world<br />\njoined to the qualities of an ascetic.<br />\nThen he bought a small place\u2014a stone<br />\nhouse with a high stone wall about it and<br />\nthere he stayed.<br />\nIt is not possible in a small and inquisitive<br />\ncommunity to shut yourself off from your<br />\nneighbors without the rise of stories and<br />\nrumors. It was said by some that the young<br />\nman was an exile from a foreign country, by<br />\nothers that he was a fugitive from justice,<br />\nand since he did not go to communion it was<br />\nsuggested that he was a Rosicrucian or a<br />\nmember of some terrible and secret sect. But<br />\nfor all that, the young man only appeared at<br />\ndusk walking along some lonely lane or riding<br />\na great black stallion. He never inquired at<br />\nthe postoffice, and few if any knew his name.<br />\nAnd so he lived his solitary life, and except<br />\nfor a month every year in which it was<br />\nthought he went away, he stayed on bothering no one and requiring the same consideration from the men of the valley.<br />\nNow here was an adventure worthy of the<br />\nmood which was on me. An awe had filled<br />\nthe countryside, and full grown men had been<br />\nheard to say that though they would give<br />\nmuch to know what was behind that stone<br />\nwall there was little on this earth that would<br />\ntempt thin to enter either by fair means or<br />\nfoul. There were stories of wild bears who<br />\nguarded the \"Sombre Gard,\" and of great<br />\ndogs and serpents, and for all I know of<br />\nwinged dragons that protected the sanctity of<br />\nthe place.<br />\nBy following the little brook by whose purling waters I had been sitting I came at last to<br />\nthe farm which belonged to the Man in Black.<br />\nIn these ten years the place had grown up in<br />\nunderbrush, in weeds, the fences were covered<br />\nwith morning glories, poison ivy, and in many<br />\ncases there were no fences at all.<br />\nThe little brook wound in and out among<br />\nthe willows and sycamores until it reached a<br />\nstone wall, at which it flowed under. By getting down on my hands and knees and crawling down 11 tunnel I was able to get inside the<br />\ngrounds. But at the end of the tunnel were<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LVIVElt.<br />\n<br />\nsome iron bars. One of these was rusted<br />\nloose at the bottom and by squeezing I got<br />\nthrough.<br />\nOn looking around I saw that I was in a<br />\ngreat garden. The brook emptied into a basin<br />\nof concrete large enough for bathing, and on<br />\nits surface floated a large and graceful swan<br />\nlonely in its surroundings. The garden had<br />\nhere and there massive stone benches, and<br />\nranged around the pool were pedestals on<br />\nwhich were bronze heads of the Grecian type.<br />\nBut the whole place was shaded by a great<br />\nweeping-willow tree which threw a dark<br />\nshadow over the garden. The walls were<br />\ncovered with ivy and other clinging vines and<br />\nmoss was growing in the dark corners. At<br />\none end the house rose up, gabled and severe,<br />\nits stones stained by years and its shingles<br />\ncovered with moss, while ivy here too climbed<br />\naloft and struck out with pale green clinging<br />\ntendrils. Some swallows chattered in the<br />\nchimney, but this was the only sign of life.<br />\nI caught a glimpse of the massive iron gateway with a much bolted and chained wicket<br />\nbeside it. In fact the residence of the Man<br />\nin Black was well nigh as impenetratable as a<br />\nfortress and more awful than a grave yard.<br />\nNone the less the door was standing open<br />\nfrom the garden, and trembling from excitement and some little trepidation I tiptoed in<br />\nwith my bare and silent feet. I listened\u2014I<br />\ncould hear nothing but the sleepy ticking of a<br />\nwall clock and the pounding of a hammer in<br />\nmy breast.<br />\nThe place was apparently deserted. Taking<br />\ncourage I determined to explore. The old<br />\nfurniture was dark, the walls and ceiling were<br />\npaneled. An escutcheon in gold and red and<br />\nblack was the only thing to relieve the dismal<br />\nhallway. I turned into a dining-room quite<br />\nunused with dust on everything. Heavy<br />\nbrocades were at the windows and a magnificent oriental rug was on the floor, and quantities of plate were on the built-in sideboard.<br />\n. I moved on. In the next room I found a<br />\ngreat library. I had never before seen so<br />\nmany books, folios and smaller books, some<br />\nin vellum, some stamped in gold. There<br />\nwere only six modern books in the room<br />\n\u2014two were:<br />\n\"The Love Poems of an Unknown.\"<br />\n\"The Golden Stair.\"<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nThey stood on the shelf of the mantel piece<br />\nand above them was the miniature of a young<br />\nwoman\u2014not pretty but beautiful. The face<br />\nwas willful and proud, and there were certain<br />\nlines in her face about the eyes that I did not<br />\nlike, and yet the face was so beautiful that it<br />\ntransfixed me.<br />\nThe four other books were bound in yellow<br />\nand black with illustrations, which I have<br />\nsince found were done by Aubrey Beardesly\u2014<br />\nstrange creations of evil fascination:<br />\n\"Papillon.\"<br />\n\"Creme Yvette.\"<br />\n\"L'Enfant Diable.\"<br />\n\"The Joyous Gard.\"<br />\nAbove these was the pretty face of a woman<br />\nin the costume of a fancy dress ball, it seemed<br />\nto me. Her looks were alluringly seductive<br />\nand her lips full and smiling.<br />\nI did not pay the same attention to the rest<br />\nof the room. It looked like our library at<br />\nhome except that the large table was covered<br />\nwith papers and a typewriter stood with a<br />\nsheet of paper in it ready for use. Around<br />\nthe walls were photographs of famous men<br />\nautographed, and some manuscript pages were<br />\nframed also.<br />\nI pushed on to the next room.

Some were of the<br />\ndream life, others of the sorrow that I felt so<br />\nkeenly, others of the despair I had and the<br />\nlast of the life of dissipation which I led to<br />\nkill the pain. The life of a recluse gave me<br />\nample time to polish and perfect the volumes.<br />\nAt last I was sure of myself; I published them<br />\nanonymously. Ever before me came the<br />\npicture of the woman who had given me up,<br />\nbecause she thought me unstable and lazy,<br />\nand great was my joy when I learned that the<br />\npublic had gone wild about the work. You<br />\ncan not understand the pleasure I had in saying to myself, \"If she only knew, but she<br />\nmust not know.\" Then one month a year I<br />\nwould come east and watch her as she knelt<br />\nin church, as she went to dances; I have even<br />\ndined with her in disguise. But she was not<br />\nhappy, she is not happy now. I have gotten<br />\nover it I sometimes think. I have tasted the<br />\ngreatest sorrow and the most intense satisfaction. I have lived in bustling crowds and in<br />\nsolitude. I have plunged into the most<br />\nviolent excesses and have lived the most<br />\nsevere of lives. I can see through the lives<br />\nof people, I can sympathize with their faults<br />\nand shortcomings. But love is dead; I could<br />\nnot love the woman any more. I love her<br />\nmemory and she loves me.\"<br />\n\"Two nights before you met me I was in the<br />\ntheatre; the woman was there in a box also.<br />\nShe spied me out in the audience and turned<br />\nwhite as a sheet.

I forgave, for I<br />\nsympathized; but I told her I did not love<br />\nher. She had changed; she had no soul.\"<br />\nHere he stopped, and as I went out to bathe<br />\nI heard the door below shut.<br />\nThe next day brought astonishing news. I<br />\nreceived the following note:<br />\nDEAR CARRUTHERS:<br />\nAlthough we have just met\u2014as the world would<br />\nsay, I can not help but realize that you know more<br />\nthan any one of my life.

He<br />\nwas one of those souls who was too far above<br />\nthis world to live in any thing else but solitude.<br />\nHe was a genius.<br />\n<br />\nTHE \"ATHLETIC CRAZE\" AT OXFORD.<br />\nThe Duke of Wellington is popularly supposed to have said that the battle of Waterloo<br />\nwas won upon the playing fields of Eton. As<br />\nthe battle of Waterloo was won by the Prussians, and the Prussian element is never very<br />\nconspicuous in the English public schools,<br />\nwe must suppose the noble Duke failed, in<br />\nthis instance, to combine epigrammatic force<br />\nand strict veracity. However this may be,<br />\nthe advocates of excessive athletics have<br />\nalways quoted the Duke of Wellington's remark, in order to prove that what they say<br />\nabout the value of athletics is true.<br />\nNo one doubts for a moment that athletics<br />\nare of the utmost importance in man's life.<br />\nThe physical and moral training received from<br />\nthem in boyhood have a far reaching effect on<br />\nthe health and character of a man throughout<br />\nhis life. But the object of these few remarks<br />\nis not to pour forth platitudes about games; it<br />\nis meant to show that games can be carried to<br />\nexcess, and Oxford is the place where this is<br />\nmost palpably obvious.<br />\nTo understand properly the system of games<br />\nat an English University, one must first consider how they are regarded at the great<br />\npublic schools. Most men who go to Oxford<br />\nhave been at a public school from the age of<br />\nthirteen to that of eighteen, and it is there<br />\nthat they gain all their athletic training.<br />\nThese schools are all alike as regards<br />\nCricket, which, being the English national<br />\ngame, is universally played. But with other<br />\ngames it is different.; some schools play<br />\n\"Rugger,\" others play \"Soccer;\" some play<br />\nHockey, others do not; those schools which<br />\nare near a river set great store by their rowing,<br />\nthe others have to eschew aquatic pursuits<br />\naltogether; some schools, such as Eton,<br />\nHarrow and Winchester, play a kind of football peculiar to themselves, and are only just<br />\nbeginning to take up \"Rugger\" and \"Soccer.\"<br />\nThe consequence is that, when these boys<br />\ngo up to Oxford or Cambridge, they are encouraged to keep together in small bands or<br />\ncliques. Often a large number of boys from<br />\nthe same school go up to the same college at<br />\nOxford, and that college gains in reputation<br />\nfor being a \"Rugger\" or a \"Soccer\" college,<br />\naccording as the majority of its members is<br />\ndrawn from a \"Rugger\" or a \"Soccer\"<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nschool. This is all very well in moderation,<br />\nbut it means that Oxford is dominated by an<br />\nAthletic Spirit. Many a man would sooner<br />\nget a \"Blue\" (that is to say, would sooner represent Oxford against Cambridge in any of<br />\nthe branches of athletics) than a First Class<br />\nin the schools. Many a man comes up to<br />\nOxford merely in order to get a \"Blue,\" and<br />\nconsequently does only so much work as is<br />\nabsolutely necessary for the passing of the<br />\nmost elementary examinations.<br />\nThese, moreover, are usually the men who<br />\nbecome leaders of the college, and from whom<br />\nthe college takes its tone, which is only<br />\nnatural, seeing that they have far more time<br />\nthan any one else to go round and visit their<br />\nfriends, and shine prominently in the social<br />\nworld of the college.<br />\nThis is unfortunate. Intellect, unless it be<br />\nbacked up by muscle, has to surrender the<br />\npre-eminence to brute force; conversation is<br />\nlargely about athletics; and \"training\" and<br />\nkindred subjects become the lodestars which<br />\nguide the athletic aspirant's life. Cases,<br />\nthough fortunately not many, are on record<br />\nof the authorities in a college offering scholarships to prominent public school athletes<br />\nwho, without monetary assistance, would be<br />\nunable to come up to Oxford.<br />\nAthletics do then play a very large part in<br />\nthe life of an Oxford undergraduate, and the<br />\nconsequences of the tendency for interest in<br />\nthem to increase are, as has been noted above,<br />\nthat athletic tastes tend to bring men together<br />\ninto small groups to the exclusion of those,<br />\nin the life of whom athletics play but a secondary part. Also college tone is liable to be<br />\nformed by the athletes of a college, who are<br />\nalways a minority, and the tone thus formed<br />\nis not always as high as it might be.<br />\nThe tendency then to athletics in excess is<br />\ndangerous, and it is one which should he<br />\nguarded against, not only at Oxford, but in<br />\nall such institutions. Sufficient time is given<br />\nto sports of all kinds, a sufficient interest is<br />\ntaken in them in their legitimate spheres, to<br />\nmake the undue emphasis that is laid upon<br />\nthem, very unnecessary and in many ways<br />\ninjurious. College games at Oxford take<br />\nplace every afternoon, and are played with the<br />\nutmost keeness and energy. It is a great<br />\nfeat to be in any of the college teams, and a<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\ngreater feat still to be chosen out of all the<br />\n3,000 undergraduates to play for Oxford<br />\nagainst Cambridge, and so win the coveted<br />\ndark blue scarf. But when the games are<br />\nover, and an hour has been spent in discussing<br />\nthem and theorizing about the \"might have<br />\nbeen,\" it is a pity to spend the rest of the<br />\nevening and most of the next day in a fruitless<br />\neffort to decide whether Jones was really offside or whether the referee was intoxicated.<br />\nThe purpose of these remarks is not in the<br />\nleast to decry Athletics; that would be folly,<br />\nbut they are written in the hope that the<br />\npresent state of things at Oxford\u2014a state of<br />\nthings against which there is sure shortly to<br />\nbe a reaction\u2014n-my be a warning to other institutions of a somewhat similar nature. The<br />\ngood which Athletics do for a man is so great<br />\nthat every one is tempted to err on the side of<br />\nexcess rather than of deficiency in respect to<br />\nthe time given to them, but the evils of a<br />\ndeficiency in this are obvious to all, whereas<br />\nfew, unless it has been forcibly brought home<br />\nto them, take the trouble to consider the evils<br />\nof excess. He is a wise man who remembers<br />\nthat \"there is a time for all things.\"<br />\n<br />\nB. A. OXON,<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\nThere is not much to be said now about<br />\n'Varsity lacrosse. Practices are in full swing,<br />\nand the boys are working hard. The 'Varsity<br />\npractices have been showing a slow but steady<br />\nimprovement, and they give promise of a good<br />\nteam this year. The vacant positions are<br />\nbeing closely contested, and when the team<br />\ngets out to the park, the fight will be a very<br />\npretty one, and one productive of good for<br />\nthe team.<br />\nManager Hunting has announced the schedule for 1907 as follows:<br />\nApril 6\u2014Alumni.<br />\nApril 13\u2014Harvard University.<br />\nApril 20\u2014Lehigh University.<br />\nApril 27\u2014Mt.

It is<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nrather unfortunate that a game with Cornell<br />\ncould not be arranged for, this year, as the<br />\nfellows are anxious to meet that team again<br />\nfor various reasons. Although beaten by us<br />\nby a score of 9 to 0 last year, Cornell would<br />\nnot recognize our claim to the championship<br />\nof the United States, because, as they argued,<br />\nthe game was played on Hopkins territory.<br />\nThat was all very true, but Maryland Oval is<br />\njust as foreign to the Hopkins team as to<br />\nCornell. We were no more familiar with it<br />\nthan they. However, no matter what Cornell<br />\nmay claim, the score of 9 to 0 ought to silence<br />\nall protests from Ithaca.<br />\n<br />\nOnce more the NEWS-LETTER arises to utter<br />\na cry against what it deems an evil at the<br />\nUniversity, and that is the condition of the<br />\nlights in the cage. All this year, that is,<br />\nsince October, the lights have given a great<br />\ndeal of trouble, and we think that some of<br />\nthis trouble has been unnecessary. Some<br />\nnights, there would be as many as half of the<br />\nlamps out of commission. When such was<br />\nthe case, any lacrosse practice was absolutely<br />\nout of the question. Almost every day an<br />\nelectrician can be seen, working on the lamps<br />\nat the top of a ladder, but, even with this<br />\nconstant repair, there is seldom a night when<br />\nall the lights are on duty. Now, why not<br />\ninstall, say, two of those brilliant lights, such<br />\nas ornament the front of the Gayety Theatre?<br />\nDoubtless, many of our readers are familiar<br />\nwith the excellence of those lights. Two or<br />\nthree lamps like them would make the cage<br />\nalmost as bright as day, might save the lighting bill, and would help the athletic teams immensely.<br />\nThe track system has begun, and judging<br />\nfrom the start the coming season should be a<br />\nbanner one. The first meet of the season was<br />\nheld at the Armory, January 5th, and the few<br />\nmen entered from Hopkins managed to win<br />\nseveral places; Hunter 2nd in the 100-yard<br />\ndash, Stewart 2nd in the hurdles and Breyer<br />\n2nd in the mile.<br />\nThe next event was the interclass meet,<br />\nheld in the cage. This was won by 1909 by<br />\nthe close score of 37 to 35, and it was not<br />\nuntil the last event that the meet was decided.<br />\n<br />\n1908 seemed to excel! in the longer distances,<br />\nbut in the short dashes the material from the<br />\nfreshman class proved the faster. The last meet was the open meet at Richmond, Saturday, January 26. Hopkins was scheduled to<br />\nmeet Georgetown in a relay race, but at the<br />\nlast moment Georgetown refused to run, and<br />\nonly two men journeyed to Virginia. Stewart<br />\nwon first place from scratch in the 440 yard<br />\ndash and third in the hurdles. Brenton ran<br />\na nervy race in the mile and came in closely<br />\nbehind Bosher, of Virginia, who drew third.<br />\nThe next meet will come February 9th, and<br />\nthe black and blue expect to show up well.<br />\nThe annual Hopkins meet will be held<br />\nMarch 2nd, and all candidates must get out<br />\nand get inao good trim.<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS COTILLON.<br />\nThe second of the series of Cotillons given<br />\nby the Johns Hopkins University will take<br />\nplace on Friday, February 1st.

The Freshman and Junior banquets have always<br />\nbeen enjoyable to all concerned. Especially the Freshman banquet.<br />\n*<br />\n111<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBut we would council those interested against interfering too much<br />\n*<br />\n40t.<br />\nwith the routine of the University work. It has always been a<br />\nV<br />\nsource of pride and should always be, that this University is less<br />\nVIVVVV WV**<br />\naddicted to certain childish pleasures than any other. It should be<br />\ntIVIVV\u2022<br />\n'COST*,<br />\nremembered by those undergraduates who are so clamorous for Home111<br />\n'<br />\nwood that their cause is not helped by instilling into the average<br />\ncitizen the erroneous idea that Hopkins is a kindergarten and Baltimore its play-ground. The<br />\nnewspapers are only too ready to garble facts to make interesting reading. What we mean is<br />\nthat just as good a time can be had without disturbing the peace of the town and the University.<br />\n111<br />\ntIPROV<br />\nVII6VIAV<br />\n110VVV, .<br />\n.<br />\n1.1.1<br />\nV \u2022<br /><br />\nAYS the Princeton man; \"And do you have a good time at Hopkins?\"<br />\nThen in a pitying way he tells great tales of things that he and his<br />\nfriends do at Princeton. Now laying aside the matter of what really<br />\nis a good time and whether the Princeton idea of a good time is the<br />\ncorrect one, we would suggest that it is possible to have as good a time<br />\nqV, at Hopkins as at any other place for the following reasons.<br />\nV<br />\nFirst\u2014That a man's friends are the source of his greatest<br />\n11. :VVVVVVVVVI:<br />\npleasure.<br />\nV V<br />\n11<br />\n.<br />\nV(*VW<br />\nSecond\u2014That a small college is more conducive to friendship.<br />\nNV'LAITY<br />\nThird\u2014That Baltimore possesses advantages for a good time<br />\nwhich a mere college town does not. Johns Hopkins has always had a considerable number<br />\nof the nicest fellows one could meet. At least there are as many as anyone could know well<br />\nat any college. Moreover the spirit of southern hospitality is so strong, that having made<br />\nyour friends, you will find Baltimore the most enjoyable place in the country. We are not<br /><br />\n;<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nsaying that every man who comes to Hopkins will have this fortune, but he will if he<br />\ndeserves it.<br />\nThe writer has heard many men in Princeton say: \"There is not a thing to do all<br />\nwinter after the football season. You have to go to New York or Philadelphia to have a good<br />\ntime.\" Now the things which one can do in those towns can be done in Baltimore at any<br />\ntime and with less demoralizing effect on the individual and the institution. The theatres, the<br />\nlibraries, the social life are all here to be used by anyone who is eligible. And after a week<br />\nin town what is more refreshing than a week end in the country. The point we would<br />\nemphasize is, that anyone with the ability to make friends is able to have at his command a<br />\nbetter time here than anywhere else. If he has not the qualifications for making the right<br />\nsort of friends, he will have a pretty poor time where ever he goes.<br /><br />\nN Saturday, January 19, 1907, Sargent's great picure \"The Four<br />\nDoctors\" was unveiled. To quote from a leader in the Baltimore<br />\nNews, \"The four men, who were the original members of the Faculty<br />\nof Medicine of Johns Hopkins University, and whose eminence, each<br />\nin his own field was the chief source of great distinction which that<br />\npart of the University attained almost immediately upon its foundation will be commemorated forever in a notable work of art.\"<br />\nWhether this picture is the greatest work of Sargent or no, it<br />\nis is enough to say that it is the work of the artist's mature years<br />\nwhen his discernment is at its best and his mastery of technique<br />\nfacile. They are few who will not accord to the American cosmopolite, the title of the greatest living portrait painter.<br />\nSargent has ever been noted among artists as one \"who paints the thing as he sees it<br />\nfor the God of things as they are.\" Women of fashion have winced under his treatment, and<br />\nso have men of distinction, but the man who is really great has nothing to fear in his hands,<br />\nfor Sargent tells the truth.<br />\nIt is singularly felicitous, then, that the University, whose motto<br />\nVeritas Vos Liberabit\"<br />\nhas been most scrupulously acted on, should have in its archives so accurate and so truthful<br />\na record of its great men.<br />\nThis picture may lead to the addition of others but should it not, the influence, be it<br />\nunconscious, will be great. The wonderful composition, the admirable brush work, the<br />\naccurate draughtsmanship, can not help but be an inspiration to all.<br /><br />\nWHY?<br /><br />\nAnd one she spins, and the second winds,<br />\nAnd the third she flings the spool<br /><br />\nThree women sit at the end of the world<br />\nOn a mountain wondrous high.<br /><br />\nAnd little it matters where it lights\u2014<br />\nThe thread the wise or the fool.<br /><br />\nAnd they spin the while and sing and smile<br />\nAs they cast the bobbins out of the sky.<br /><br />\nAnd the string is strung with tears and fears,<br /><br />\nThey spin the span of every man<br /><br />\nWith paltry glitter too,<br /><br />\nThey weave the woof of life<br /><br />\nAnd fall as it may there all unwinds<br /><br />\nAnd all they wind for poor mankind<br /><br />\nWhat the women wound in the clue.<br />\n\u2014J. M. B.<br /><br />\nContains its full of fault and strife.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE SOMBRE CARD.<br />\nI.<br />\nIt is a country side of great holdings and<br />\nlarge houses. The hills are covered with forests of primeval timber. From little clefts in<br />\nthe rock, little springs bubble and boil out,<br />\nthence fall in small cascades down into little<br />\nverdant valleys, and as the brooks grow they<br />\njoin and flow into the great river of the Ohio.<br />\nMany of the houses are quite old and the<br />\nfamilies have held them for somewhat over a<br />\nhundred years\u2014a great space of time in the<br />\nWest.<br />\nSince I was born I have spent much time<br />\nin one of these formless, massive, houses with<br />\nmany wings, great chimneys and high walls<br />\nsurrounding old fashioned gardens and moribund orchards.<br />\nIn one of the long summer afternoons of<br />\nAugust when I was quite a child I accumulated my dearest possessions: a copy of the<br />\nCount of Monte Christo, a supply of cornsilk,<br />\nmatches and cigarrette papers, and a stick<br />\nwith a nail in the end sharpened for use in<br />\nspearing frogs.<br />\nI stole out through the garden all fragrant<br />\nwith currant and gooseberry odors, fallen rose<br />\nleaves and pungent with poppies. Past the<br />\nsage, the feathered asparagus spotted with<br />\nred berries, a drink at the spring-house and<br />\nthen I plunged into the willows, a cool retreat<br />\nfrom the glare of the sun.<br />\nFor an hour I amused myself with the cornsilk cigarettes and the Count of Monte Christo<br />\nand then I began to wonder if somewhere on<br />\nthe place there might not be a treasure cave,<br />\nunderground passages or the like, at least a<br />\nghost.<br />\nAfter reflecting, I remembered that the only<br />\nromantic thing in the neighborhood which<br />\nwas available was the oecupant of the<br />\n\"Sombre Gard.\"<br />\nAbout ten years before on a Good Friday a<br />\nyoung man had appeared in the quiet neighborhood. He had all the ear marks of a<br />\ngentleman. His clothes were black and carefully pressed, his hair was light, his eyes<br />\nwere green and the long lashes gave him the<br />\nair of being able to look at the surrounding<br />\nworld without in the least betraying what he<br />\nthought, and at the same time withdrawing<br /><br />\nhimself from view. He gave no cause for his<br />\ncoming, answered all questions without any<br />\ninformation as to his past escaping his lips.<br />\nIn his bearing he was intensely reserved\u2014a<br />\nhauteur with the graces of a man of the world<br />\njoined to the qualities of an ascetic.<br />\nThen he bought a small place\u2014a stone<br />\nhouse with a high stone wall about it and<br />\nthere he stayed.<br />\nIt is not possible in a small and inquisitive<br />\ncommunity to shut yourself off from your<br />\nneighbors without the rise of stories and<br />\nrumors. It was said by some that the young<br />\nman was an exile from a foreign country, by<br />\nothers that he was a fugitive from justice,<br />\nand since he did not go to communion it was<br />\nsuggested that he was a Rosicrucian or a<br />\nmember of some terrible and secret sect. But<br />\nfor all that, the young man only appeared at<br />\ndusk walking along some lonely lane or riding<br />\na great black stallion. He never inquired at<br />\nthe postoffice, and few if any knew his name.<br />\nAnd so he lived his solitary life, and except<br />\nfor a month every year in which it was<br />\nthought he went away, he stayed on bothering no one and requiring the same consideration from the men of the valley.<br />\nNow here was an adventure worthy of the<br />\nmood which was on me. An awe had filled<br />\nthe countryside, and full grown men had been<br />\nheard to say that though they would give<br />\nmuch to know what was behind that stone<br />\nwall there was little on this earth that would<br />\ntempt thin to enter either by fair means or<br />\nfoul. There were stories of wild bears who<br />\nguarded the \"Sombre Gard,\" and of great<br />\ndogs and serpents, and for all I know of<br />\nwinged dragons that protected the sanctity of<br />\nthe place.<br />\nBy following the little brook by whose purling waters I had been sitting I came at last to<br />\nthe farm which belonged to the Man in Black.<br />\nIn these ten years the place had grown up in<br />\nunderbrush, in weeds, the fences were covered<br />\nwith morning glories, poison ivy, and in many<br />\ncases there were no fences at all.<br />\nThe little brook wound in and out among<br />\nthe willows and sycamores until it reached a<br />\nstone wall, at which it flowed under. By getting down on my hands and knees and crawling down 11 tunnel I was able to get inside the<br />\ngrounds. But at the end of the tunnel were<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LVIVElt.<br /><br />\nsome iron bars. One of these was rusted<br />\nloose at the bottom and by squeezing I got<br />\nthrough.<br />\nOn looking around I saw that I was in a<br />\ngreat garden. The brook emptied into a basin<br />\nof concrete large enough for bathing, and on<br />\nits surface floated a large and graceful swan<br />\nlonely in its surroundings. The garden had<br />\nhere and there massive stone benches, and<br />\nranged around the pool were pedestals on<br />\nwhich were bronze heads of the Grecian type.<br />\nBut the whole place was shaded by a great<br />\nweeping-willow tree which threw a dark<br />\nshadow over the garden. The walls were<br />\ncovered with ivy and other clinging vines and<br />\nmoss was growing in the dark corners. At<br />\none end the house rose up, gabled and severe,<br />\nits stones stained by years and its shingles<br />\ncovered with moss, while ivy here too climbed<br />\naloft and struck out with pale green clinging<br />\ntendrils. Some swallows chattered in the<br />\nchimney, but this was the only sign of life.<br />\nI caught a glimpse of the massive iron gateway with a much bolted and chained wicket<br />\nbeside it. In fact the residence of the Man<br />\nin Black was well nigh as impenetratable as a<br />\nfortress and more awful than a grave yard.<br />\nNone the less the door was standing open<br />\nfrom the garden, and trembling from excitement and some little trepidation I tiptoed in<br />\nwith my bare and silent feet. I listened\u2014I<br />\ncould hear nothing but the sleepy ticking of a<br />\nwall clock and the pounding of a hammer in<br />\nmy breast.<br />\nThe place was apparently deserted. Taking<br />\ncourage I determined to explore. The old<br />\nfurniture was dark, the walls and ceiling were<br />\npaneled. An escutcheon in gold and red and<br />\nblack was the only thing to relieve the dismal<br />\nhallway. I turned into a dining-room quite<br />\nunused with dust on everything. Heavy<br />\nbrocades were at the windows and a magnificent oriental rug was on the floor, and quantities of plate were on the built-in sideboard.<br />\n. I moved on. In the next room I found a<br />\ngreat library. I had never before seen so<br />\nmany books, folios and smaller books, some<br />\nin vellum, some stamped in gold. There<br />\nwere only six modern books in the room<br />\n\u2014two were:<br />\n\"The Love Poems of an Unknown.\"<br />\n\"The Golden Stair.\"<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nThey stood on the shelf of the mantel piece<br />\nand above them was the miniature of a young<br />\nwoman\u2014not pretty but beautiful. The face<br />\nwas willful and proud, and there were certain<br />\nlines in her face about the eyes that I did not<br />\nlike, and yet the face was so beautiful that it<br />\ntransfixed me.<br />\nThe four other books were bound in yellow<br />\nand black with illustrations, which I have<br />\nsince found were done by Aubrey Beardesly\u2014<br />\nstrange creations of evil fascination:<br />\n\"Papillon.\"<br />\n\"Creme Yvette.\"<br />\n\"L'Enfant Diable.\"<br />\n\"The Joyous Gard.\"<br />\nAbove these was the pretty face of a woman<br />\nin the costume of a fancy dress ball, it seemed<br />\nto me. Her looks were alluringly seductive<br />\nand her lips full and smiling.<br />\nI did not pay the same attention to the rest<br />\nof the room. It looked like our library at<br />\nhome except that the large table was covered<br />\nwith papers and a typewriter stood with a<br />\nsheet of paper in it ready for use. Around<br />\nthe walls were photographs of famous men<br />\nautographed, and some manuscript pages were<br />\nframed also.<br />\nI pushed on to the next room. There I<br />\nbeheld an altar with burning candles. The<br />\nroom was pitch black. The walls were hung<br />\nwith velvet and above the altar was a painting of the Madona. I was awed.<br />\nIn the next room, down a long passageway,<br />\nI found a room hung in green and yellow.<br />\nDivans were ranged around and in the centre<br />\nI saw a magnificent statue in white marble\u2014<br />\nit was a Venus. I caught a heavy sickly odor<br />\nand then in a far corner of the room I beheld<br />\na brazier on a tabourette, then I started.<br />\nDeath pale, with a pipe long and queerly<br />\nshaped, I saw in a comatose condition the<br />\nman of the \"Sombre Gard.\"<br />\nNot for nothing had I read the \"Opium<br />\nEater\" and the \"Count of Monte Christo.\"<br />\nI was scared, I turned and fled from that<br />\nterrible presence.<br />\nAt dinner I would say nothing of where I<br />\nhad been, but all noticed in my manner an<br />\nunusual silence. But I could not help thinking I was again to meet the man of the<br />\n\"Sombre Gard.\"<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nt<br />\nthings. They were anonymous too.

Some were of the<br />\ndream life, others of the sorrow that I felt so<br />\nkeenly, others of the despair I had and the<br />\nlast of the life of dissipation which I led to<br />\nkill the pain. The life of a recluse gave me<br />\nample time to polish and perfect the volumes.<br />\nAt last I was sure of myself; I published them<br />\nanonymously. Ever before me came the<br />\npicture of the woman who had given me up,<br />\nbecause she thought me unstable and lazy,<br />\nand great was my joy when I learned that the<br />\npublic had gone wild about the work. You<br />\ncan not understand the pleasure I had in saying to myself, \"If she only knew, but she<br />\nmust not know.\" Then one month a year I<br />\nwould come east and watch her as she knelt<br />\nin church, as she went to dances; I have even<br />\ndined with her in disguise. But she was not<br />\nhappy, she is not happy now. I have gotten<br />\nover it I sometimes think. I have tasted the<br />\ngreatest sorrow and the most intense satisfaction. I have lived in bustling crowds and in<br />\nsolitude. I have plunged into the most<br />\nviolent excesses and have lived the most<br />\nsevere of lives. I can see through the lives<br />\nof people, I can sympathize with their faults<br />\nand shortcomings. But love is dead; I could<br />\nnot love the woman any more.

As<br />\nthe battle of Waterloo was won by the Prussians, and the Prussian element is never very<br />\nconspicuous in the English public schools,<br />\nwe must suppose the noble Duke failed, in<br />\nthis instance, to combine epigrammatic force<br />\nand strict veracity. However this may be,<br />\nthe advocates of excessive athletics have<br />\nalways quoted the Duke of Wellington's remark, in order to prove that what they say<br />\nabout the value of athletics is true.<br />\nNo one doubts for a moment that athletics<br />\nare of the utmost importance in man's life.<br />\nThe physical and moral training received from<br />\nthem in boyhood have a far reaching effect on<br />\nthe health and character of a man throughout<br />\nhis life. But the object of these few remarks<br />\nis not to pour forth platitudes about games; it<br />\nis meant to show that games can be carried to<br />\nexcess, and Oxford is the place where this is<br />\nmost palpably obvious.<br />\nTo understand properly the system of games<br />\nat an English University, one must first consider how they are regarded at the great<br />\npublic schools. Most men who go to Oxford<br />\nhave been at a public school from the age of<br />\nthirteen to that of eighteen, and it is there<br />\nthat they gain all their athletic training.<br />\nThese schools are all alike as regards<br />\nCricket, which, being the English national<br />\ngame, is universally played. But with other<br />\ngames it is different.; some schools play<br />\n\"Rugger,\" others play \"Soccer;\" some play<br />\nHockey, others do not; those schools which<br />\nare near a river set great store by their rowing,<br />\nthe others have to eschew aquatic pursuits<br />\naltogether; some schools, such as Eton,<br />\nHarrow and Winchester, play a kind of football peculiar to themselves, and are only just<br />\nbeginning to take up \"Rugger\" and \"Soccer.\"<br />\nThe consequence is that, when these boys<br />\ngo up to Oxford or Cambridge, they are encouraged to keep together in small bands or<br />\ncliques. Often a large number of boys from<br />\nthe same school go up to the same college at<br />\nOxford, and that college gains in reputation<br />\nfor being a \"Rugger\" or a \"Soccer\" college,<br />\naccording as the majority of its members is<br />\ndrawn from a \"Rugger\" or a \"Soccer\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nschool. This is all very well in moderation,<br />\nbut it means that Oxford is dominated by an<br />\nAthletic Spirit. Many a man would sooner<br />\nget a \"Blue\" (that is to say, would sooner represent Oxford against Cambridge in any of<br />\nthe branches of athletics) than a First Class<br />\nin the schools. Many a man comes up to<br />\nOxford merely in order to get a \"Blue,\" and<br />\nconsequently does only so much work as is<br />\nabsolutely necessary for the passing of the<br />\nmost elementary examinations.<br />\nThese, moreover, are usually the men who<br />\nbecome leaders of the college, and from whom<br />\nthe college takes its tone, which is only<br />\nnatural, seeing that they have far more time<br />\nthan any one else to go round and visit their<br />\nfriends, and shine prominently in the social<br />\nworld of the college.<br />\nThis is unfortunate. Intellect, unless it be<br />\nbacked up by muscle, has to surrender the<br />\npre-eminence to brute force; conversation is<br />\nlargely about athletics; and \"training\" and<br />\nkindred subjects become the lodestars which<br />\nguide the athletic aspirant's life. Cases,<br />\nthough fortunately not many, are on record<br />\nof the authorities in a college offering scholarships to prominent public school athletes<br />\nwho, without monetary assistance, would be<br />\nunable to come up to Oxford.<br />\nAthletics do then play a very large part in<br />\nthe life of an Oxford undergraduate, and the<br />\nconsequences of the tendency for interest in<br />\nthem to increase are, as has been noted above,<br />\nthat athletic tastes tend to bring men together<br />\ninto small groups to the exclusion of those,<br />\nin the life of whom athletics play but a secondary part. Also college tone is liable to be<br />\nformed by the athletes of a college, who are<br />\nalways a minority, and the tone thus formed<br />\nis not always as high as it might be.<br />\nThe tendency then to athletics in excess is<br />\ndangerous, and it is one which should he<br />\nguarded against, not only at Oxford, but in<br />\nall such institutions. Sufficient time is given<br />\nto sports of all kinds, a sufficient interest is<br />\ntaken in them in their legitimate spheres, to<br />\nmake the undue emphasis that is laid upon<br />\nthem, very unnecessary and in many ways<br />\ninjurious. College games at Oxford take<br />\nplace every afternoon, and are played with the<br />\nutmost keeness and energy. It is a great<br />\nfeat to be in any of the college teams, and a<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\ngreater feat still to be chosen out of all the<br />\n3,000 undergraduates to play for Oxford<br />\nagainst Cambridge, and so win the coveted<br />\ndark blue scarf. But when the games are<br />\nover, and an hour has been spent in discussing<br />\nthem and theorizing about the \"might have<br />\nbeen,\" it is a pity to spend the rest of the<br />\nevening and most of the next day in a fruitless<br />\neffort to decide whether Jones was really offside or whether the referee was intoxicated.<br />\nThe purpose of these remarks is not in the<br />\nleast to decry Athletics; that would be folly,<br />\nbut they are written in the hope that the<br />\npresent state of things at Oxford\u2014a state of<br />\nthings against which there is sure shortly to<br />\nbe a reaction\u2014n-my be a warning to other institutions of a somewhat similar nature. The<br />\ngood which Athletics do for a man is so great<br />\nthat every one is tempted to err on the side of<br />\nexcess rather than of deficiency in respect to<br />\nthe time given to them, but the evils of a<br />\ndeficiency in this are obvious to all, whereas<br />\nfew, unless it has been forcibly brought home<br />\nto them, take the trouble to consider the evils<br />\nof excess. He is a wise man who remembers<br />\nthat \"there is a time for all things.\"<br /><br />\nB. A. OXON,<br /><br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\nThere is not much to be said now about<br />\n'Varsity lacrosse. Practices are in full swing,<br />\nand the boys are working hard. The 'Varsity<br />\npractices have been showing a slow but steady<br />\nimprovement, and they give promise of a good<br />\nteam this year. The vacant positions are<br />\nbeing closely contested, and when the team<br />\ngets out to the park, the fight will be a very<br />\npretty one, and one productive of good for<br />\nthe team.<br />\nManager Hunting has announced the schedule for 1907 as follows:<br />\nApril 6\u2014Alumni.<br />\nApril 13\u2014Harvard University.<br />\nApril 20\u2014Lehigh University.<br />\nApril 27\u2014Mt. Washington.<br />\nMay 4\u2014Stevens Institdte.<br />\nMay 11\u2014Swarthmore College.<br />\nAll of the above names, with the exception<br />\nof the last, will be played in Baltimore.<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania will not be played<br />\nthis year, and neither will Cornell. It is<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nrather unfortunate that a game with Cornell<br />\ncould not be arranged for, this year, as the<br />\nfellows are anxious to meet that team again<br />\nfor various reasons. Although beaten by us<br />\nby a score of 9 to 0 last year, Cornell would<br />\nnot recognize our claim to the championship<br />\nof the United States, because, as they argued,<br />\nthe game was played on Hopkins territory.<br />\nThat was all very true, but Maryland Oval is<br />\njust as foreign to the Hopkins team as to<br />\nCornell. We were no more familiar with it<br />\nthan they. However, no matter what Cornell<br />\nmay claim, the score of 9 to 0 ought to silence<br />\nall protests from Ithaca.<br /><br />\nOnce more the NEWS-LETTER arises to utter<br />\na cry against what it deems an evil at the<br />\nUniversity, and that is the condition of the<br />\nlights in the cage. All this year, that is,<br />\nsince October, the lights have given a great<br />\ndeal of trouble, and we think that some of<br />\nthis trouble has been unnecessary. Some<br />\nnights, there would be as many as half of the<br />\nlamps out of commission. When such was<br />\nthe case, any lacrosse practice was absolutely<br />\nout of the question. Almost every day an<br />\nelectrician can be seen, working on the lamps<br />\nat the top of a ladder, but, even with this<br />\nconstant repair, there is seldom a night when<br />\nall the lights are on duty. Now, why not<br />\ninstall, say, two of those brilliant lights, such<br />\nas ornament the front of the Gayety Theatre?<br />\nDoubtless, many of our readers are familiar<br />\nwith the excellence of those lights. Two or<br />\nthree lamps like them would make the cage<br />\nalmost as bright as day, might save the lighting bill, and would help the athletic teams immensely.<br />\nThe track system has begun, and judging<br />\nfrom the start the coming season should be a<br />\nbanner one. The first meet of the season was<br />\nheld at the Armory, January 5th, and the few<br />\nmen entered from Hopkins managed to win<br />\nseveral places; Hunter 2nd in the 100-yard<br />\ndash, Stewart 2nd in the hurdles and Breyer<br />\n2nd in the mile.<br />\nThe next event was the interclass meet,<br />\nheld in the cage. This was won by 1909 by<br />\nthe close score of 37 to 35, and it was not<br />\nuntil the last event that the meet was decided.<br /><br />\n1908 seemed to excel! in the longer distances,<br />\nbut in the short dashes the material from the<br />\nfreshman class proved the faster. The last meet was the open meet at Richmond, Saturday, January 26. Hopkins was scheduled to<br />\nmeet Georgetown in a relay race, but at the<br />\nlast moment Georgetown refused to run, and<br />\nonly two men journeyed to Virginia. Stewart<br />\nwon first place from scratch in the 440 yard<br />\ndash and third in the hurdles. Brenton ran<br />\na nervy race in the mile and came in closely<br />\nbehind Bosher, of Virginia, who drew third.<br />\nThe next meet will come February 9th, and<br />\nthe black and blue expect to show up well.<br />\nThe annual Hopkins meet will be held<br />\nMarch 2nd, and all candidates must get out<br />\nand get inao good trim.<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS COTILLON.<br />\nThe second of the series of Cotillons given<br />\nby the Johns Hopkins University will take<br />\nplace on Friday, February 1st.
