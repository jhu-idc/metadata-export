Many people rated it<br />\nabove the New York Times. Time<br />\npaper has been an institution in<br />\nArgentina ever since its founder,<br />\nJose Clemente Paz, began editing<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nit in 1869.<br />\nDr. Alberto Gainza Paz, editor,<br />\nof the recently expropriated La<br />\nPrenza, and nephew of the founder's son, was a champion of the<br />\ndemocratic way of life and freedom<br />\nof the press in Argentina ever since<br />\nhe became editor. Dr. Paz is an<br />\nexcellent editor, highly respected<br />\nby other newspaper men all over<br />\nthe world. Ile began his battle<br />\nagainst Juan Domingo Peron as far<br />\nback as 1941 when Peron organized the G.O.U.<br />\nDr. Paz, in La Prensa, began<br />\nopen opposition in 1945, when<br />\nGeneral Farrel replaced Ramirez<br />\nas president. La Prensa -wasn't<br />\nalone in the battle: La Critica and<br />\nLa Nation, two large newspapers in<br />\nBuenos Aires, - were also at odds<br />\nwith Peron. Much as he would<br />\nhave liked to, Peron withheld legislation against the newspapers<br />\nuntil 1946, fearing that the impartial papers would turn against<br />\n<br />\n,5?<br />\n<br />\nAn already sign-littered campus was assaulted<br />\nby white paint and advertisement sheets this week.<br />\nThe reason %vas Jun..

La Olden joined<br />\nthe ranks of the Peronistas during<br />\nthe election and La Nation had<br />\ngone out of existence. thus leaving<br />\nLa Prensa alone in . its battle.<br />\nPeron's major objection to the<br />\npaper was that it printed news as<br />\nnews alone and not state propaganda.<br />\n<br />\nEarly in January, 1951, the<br />\nPeron administration came to the<br />\nend of their patience and ordered<br />\nthe pro-Peron news-vendor's union<br />\nto take action against La Prensa.<br />\nThe action came in the form of<br />\ndemands that La Prensa was expected to and did refuse. The<br />\nnews-vendors' demands were for<br />\nexclusive distribution rights, which<br />\nwould not have allowed the paper<br />\nto be mailed out of the country,<br />\nand a 20 per cent. share of the<br />\nrevenue<br />\nadvertising<br />\nclassified<br />\nWhen La 1'141in:a refused as per<br />\nplan, the. union boycotted it. The<br />\npaper's circulation fell off to the<br />\npoint where the only sales that<br />\nwere made took place over the<br />\ncounters of their offices.<br />\n<br />\nTime Peron regime was supported by four rather small papers.<br />\nDemocraeiat, a morning paper, was<br />\nthe chief organ of time administration. The Democraeia's publishing<br />\ncompany quickly bought up La<br />\nEpoea and La eritiea. In 1947<br />\nEva purchased Notidas Grafieas<br />\nbecame part of the same company<br />\nwhich publishes the other three<br />\npro-Peron papers.<br />\nPaper Shortage<br />\nJust after the last war there was<br />\na severe paper shortage in Argentina. Up uPtil this time, La Prensa<br />\nhad forty pages per issue. When<br />\nthe paper shortage first struck,<br />\nLa Prensa voluntarily reduced the<br />\nnumber of its pages. At this point<br />\nPeron saw his opportunity to get a<br />\nstrangle-hold on La Presna without<br />\nbeing accused of interfering with<br />\nfreedom of time press and at the<br />\nsame time be partial to friendly<br />\npapers. By 1948 the paper shortage was no longer in existence in<br />\nthe rest of the world but Peron saw<br />\nto it.that a real shortage existed<br />\nin the Argentine.<br />\nIn October, 1948, th-e maximum<br />\nnumber of pages allowed a newspaper was sixteen. By March,<br />\n1949, this was reduced to the alltime low of twelve pages. During<br />\nthe same month the government<br />\nexpropriated the entire newsprint<br />\nsupply of the country, including La<br />\nPr.9asn's reserve supply. A government committee doled out the<br />\npaper allotted to each newspaper.<br />\nThus, the administration had not<br />\nonly succeeded in cutting down La<br />\nPrensa's space but controlled the<br />\ncirculation as well. La Prensa was<br />\nnot only buying their paper from<br />\nthe government at the govern-<br />\n<br />\nLa Prensa ('loses<br />\nOn January 26, La Prensa closed<br />\nits doors. Dr. Paz could no longer<br />\npublish a paper because strong-arm<br />\nmen were keeping his employees<br />\nfrom the plant.. He kept his entire<br />\nstaff, however, and paid all the<br />\nsalaries and wages while the plant<br />\nwas closed.<br />\nAfter being shut down for 32<br />\ndays, 1300 workes assembled in<br />\nthe main office building and voted<br />\nunanimously to return to work the<br />\nfollowing day, with or without police protection. Police protection<br />\nwas promised.<br />\nThe next day, a thousand workers arrived at the plant with the<br />\npolice conspicuously absent, although the police station was only<br />\na block away. The workers were<br />\nfired on by a gang of armed men,<br />\nthe paper's delivery trucks were<br />\nrazed, and the building was stoned,<br />\nresulting in one dead and fourteen<br />\nwounded. Over 400 workers got<br />\ninto the plant, however, and at this<br />\npoint the police finally arrived.<br />\nAll the workers who had managed<br />\nto get into time plant were taken<br />\nto the police station for \"questioning.\"<br />\nLa Prensa was now further from<br />\nre-opening than ever. Its offices<br />\nand plant were locked up, proPeron unions declared a total boycott of the paper, and Dr. Paz was<br />\nunder a trumped up charge of<br />\n<br />\n.. carrying on activities agtinst<br />\nthe state.'' A bill was placed before<br />\nthe House of Deputies demanding<br />\nan investigation of La Prensa and<br />\nthat body passed the resolution by<br />\na vote of 85 to 14 after four hours<br />\nDuring<br />\nof tumultuous debate.<br />\nthis debate, the radical minority<br />\nleader of the House, Arturo Franshouted, \"We are not defendi\u00bbg La Prensa, we are defending freedom of the press!\" The<br />\nSenate, composed almost entirely<br />\nof Peronistas, passed the resolution in record time with a vote of<br />\n18 to 0.<br />\n\"Investigation\"<br />\nOn March 19, the nine-man committee took over La Prensa and<br />\nstarted their investigations. Two<br />\ndays later Dr. Paz was prevented<br />\nfrom flying across the River Plate<br />\nto visit bis mother in Colonia,<br />\nUraguay. because his \"papers were<br />\nnot in order.\" It is still not known<br />\nexactly what happened, but Dr.<br />\nPaz arrived in Uraguay two days<br />\nlater, presumably by yacht. The<br />\ncongressional committee accused<br />\nhim of fleeing arrest, obstructing<br />\njustice, and impeding the investigation.

During this past week Steve Yost, chairman of the<br />\nStudent Council committee, was given an oportunity to use part<br />\nof the Nest to reply on behalf of his group.

It is the job of this board to bring up the<br />\ngripes of their sports and to recommend improvements as well as<br />\npass on the awarding of letters. This year they have only passed<br />\non the awarding of monograms, and part of the blame should go<br />\nto them. Had they functioned properly the investigations might<br />\nnever have come about.<br />\n<br />\nThey crossed swords with the wrong man<br />\n<br />\nA number of alternate 'steps could have been taken by<br />\nthe Student Council.

Be that<br />\nas it may, the least the council could have done would have<br />\nbeen to conduct a quiet, discreet inquiry instead of trying to mimic<br />\nthe Kefauver hearing. The purpose of the committee was to iron<br />\nout certain minor conflicts between the different sports and the<br />\ndepartment, not a complete revision of the athletic policy. But<br />\nin the minds of those people who are not closely acquainted<br />\nwith the situation the sensational notoriety has probably tended<br />\nto imply the latter. In this, the last two Jay's Nests are just as<br />\nmuch to blame, for which we are duly sorry.

Many people rated it<br />\nabove the New York Times. Time<br />\npaper has been an institution in<br />\nArgentina ever since its founder,<br />\nJose Clemente Paz, began editing<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nit in 1869.<br />\nDr. Alberto Gainza Paz, editor,<br />\nof the recently expropriated La<br />\nPrenza, and nephew of the founder's son, was a champion of the<br />\ndemocratic way of life and freedom<br />\nof the press in Argentina ever since<br />\nhe became editor. Dr. Paz is an<br />\nexcellent editor, highly respected<br />\nby other newspaper men all over<br />\nthe world. Ile began his battle<br />\nagainst Juan Domingo Peron as far<br />\nback as 1941 when Peron organized the G.O.U.<br />\nDr. Paz, in La Prensa, began<br />\nopen opposition in 1945, when<br />\nGeneral Farrel replaced Ramirez<br />\nas president. La Prensa -wasn't<br />\nalone in the battle: La Critica and<br />\nLa Nation, two large newspapers in<br />\nBuenos Aires, - were also at odds<br />\nwith Peron. Much as he would<br />\nhave liked to, Peron withheld legislation against the newspapers<br />\nuntil 1946, fearing that the impartial papers would turn against<br /><br />\n,5?<br /><br />\nAn already sign-littered campus was assaulted<br />\nby white paint and advertisement sheets this week.<br />\nThe reason %vas Jun..

In<br />\nshort, La Prensa's' paper cost 220<br />\nper cent of the original market<br /><br />\nhim.<br /><br />\nvalue.<br /><br />\nOn February 24, 1946, Peron<br />\nwon the election for presidency<br />\nin spite of La Prensa's fiery editorial opposition. La Olden joined<br />\nthe ranks of the Peronistas during<br />\nthe election and La Nation had<br />\ngone out of existence. thus leaving<br />\nLa Prensa alone in . its battle.<br />\nPeron's major objection to the<br />\npaper was that it printed news as<br />\nnews alone and not state propaganda.<br /><br />\nEarly in January, 1951, the<br />\nPeron administration came to the<br />\nend of their patience and ordered<br />\nthe pro-Peron news-vendor's union<br />\nto take action against La Prensa.<br />\nThe action came in the form of<br />\ndemands that La Prensa was expected to and did refuse. The<br />\nnews-vendors' demands were for<br />\nexclusive distribution rights, which<br />\nwould not have allowed the paper<br />\nto be mailed out of the country,<br />\nand a 20 per cent. share of the<br />\nrevenue<br />\nadvertising<br />\nclassified<br />\nWhen La 1'141in:a refused as per<br />\nplan, the. union boycotted it. The<br />\npaper's circulation fell off to the<br />\npoint where the only sales that<br />\nwere made took place over the<br />\ncounters of their offices.<br /><br />\nTime Peron regime was supported by four rather small papers.<br />\nDemocraeiat, a morning paper, was<br />\nthe chief organ of time administration. The Democraeia's publishing<br />\ncompany quickly bought up La<br />\nEpoea and La eritiea. In 1947<br />\nEva purchased Notidas Grafieas<br />\nbecame part of the same company<br />\nwhich publishes the other three<br />\npro-Peron papers.<br />\nPaper Shortage<br />\nJust after the last war there was<br />\na severe paper shortage in Argentina.

After the developments of the past week the situation seems to have come to a head<br />\nand probably the best thing to do now is let it die a natural death.<br />\nPersonally, your writer finds it impossible to support fully<br />\neither side. Agreed, there are things in the department that<br />\ncould stand improvement. No organization is perfect. The<br />\nrecommendations of the committee may be of value here, although<br />\nMr. Turner has stated that he doubts any points will be brought<br />\nup that he has not already thought of and has tried or found<br /><br />\n\"They had me<br />\nfencing with<br />\nfancy facts!\"<br /><br />\nimpossible to remedy.<br />\nThe Student Council decided to undertake this investigation<br />\ndue to lack of action on the part of the A. A. Board, composed of<br />\nthe team captains. It is the job of this board to bring up the<br />\ngripes of their sports and to recommend improvements as well as<br />\npass on the awarding of letters. This year they have only passed<br />\non the awarding of monograms, and part of the blame should go<br />\nto them. Had they functioned properly the investigations might<br />\nnever have come about.<br /><br />\nThey crossed swords with the wrong man<br /><br />\nA number of alternate 'steps could have been taken by<br />\nthe Student Council. They could have requested or recommended<br />\nthat the A. A. Board take over and satisfy the unrest by discussing<br />\nthe problems with the department. The argument has been brought<br />\nup that some of the captains are looking forward to coaching<br /><br />\nwhen they engaged this swashbuckling senior<br />\nin combat!

Be that<br />\nas it may, the least the council could have done would have<br />\nbeen to conduct a quiet, discreet inquiry instead of trying to mimic<br />\nthe Kefauver hearing. The purpose of the committee was to iron<br />\nout certain minor conflicts between the different sports and the<br />\ndepartment, not a complete revision of the athletic policy. But<br />\nin the minds of those people who are not closely acquainted<br />\nwith the situation the sensational notoriety has probably tended<br />\nto imply the latter. In this, the last two Jay's Nests are just as<br />\nmuch to blame, for which we are duly sorry. If the committee had<br />\nconducted a quiet investigation their purpose would 'have been<br />\nachieved and their recommendations made without exciting half<br />\nthe Hopkins campus, the faculty, and anyone else who read the<br />\nNews-Leiter stories.<br />\nThus your writer agrees that the *general purpose of the<br />\nStudent Council's inquiry is a good one, since people who take<br /><br />\nIt's the sensible test ... the 30-Day Camel<br />\nMildness Test, which simply asks you to try Camels<br />\nas your steady smoke, on a day-after-day,<br />\npack-after-pack basis.
