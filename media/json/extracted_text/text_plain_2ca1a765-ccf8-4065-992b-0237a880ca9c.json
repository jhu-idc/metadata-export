Paul Molina, book sale<br />\nchairman, stated, \"I will not<br />\nreopen the book sale unless<br />\nassured by Dr. Benton that those<br />\nbook currently available have<br />\nbeen carefully examined.\"<br />\n\"Before the book. sale was<br />\nundertaken, I was personally<br />\nguaranteed by the library that<br />\nthe Gilman volumes would be<br />\nchecked with the archivist.<br />\nHowever, we soon found out that<br />\nsuch was not the case,\"<br />\ncontended Mike Lenard\u00b0, SC<br />\nPresident.<br />\nDavid Stam, head librarian at<br />\nMSE, believes that the basic<br />\nproblem was the sheer size of the<br />\ncollection to be reviewed. \"Part<br />\nof the problem is, there were so<br />\nmany books it was inevitable that<br />\nsome important editions would<br />\nSlip through,\" he said.<br />\nBut in a meeting With a SC<br />\ndelegation, George Benton,<br />\nVice-President for Homewood<br />\nDivisions, definitely stated that<br />\nthe books had never been<br />\nchecked for volumes of archival<br />\nvalue. Benton elaborated that<br />\n\"there had been some breakdown<br />\nill communication between the<br />\nlibrary hierarchy. Kathryn Jacobs<br />\n(university archivist) and my<br />\n<br />\noffice.\" Apparently, no attempt<br />\nwas made to view books for their<br />\narchival worth. \"Plainly, the<br />\nbooks were never opened,\" said<br />\nSC representative Leah<br />\nSeidenfeld.<br />\nAlthough questions exists<br />\nwhether the library ever<br />\nevaluated the hooks, Associate<br />\nLibrarian David Taylor stated<br />\nthat the basic contention<br />\ntween the library and students<br />\nis what should be considered<br />\nassociational value\u2014that is, books<br />\nwith an autograph of a famous<br />\nscholar, annotation from a<br />\nHopkins scholar, or a book from<br />\nthe personal collection of a major<br />\npersonage.<br />\n\"In my view applying the term<br />\narchival freely is misusing the<br />\nterm,\" stated Taylor. \"Usually<br />\nthe books in the index collection<br />\n(that group of volumes for sale)<br />\nare duplicates and once you<br />\ndecide that a book is significant<br />\nenough to become part of a<br />\npermanent collection it costs<br />\nsomething to add it.\"<br />\nA similar problem occurred<br />\nlast summer when the library<br />\nsold a large set of books to the<br />\nJohn Gach book store. When<br />\ndiscovered that the set contained<br />\nseveral significant volumes, a<br />\nrepurchase was made (e.g.<br />\nLovejoy collection).<br />\n\"When this situation arose last<br />\nsummer it was agreed that<br />\ncollections would be reviewed<br />\n<br />\nprior to sale, for the future,\"<br />\nstated Betty Murdoch, assistant<br />\nto the Vice -President of<br />\nHomewood divisions. \"It was Dr.<br />\nBenton's understanding that this<br />\nprocedure was carried out prior<br />\nto the Student Council sale,\" she<br />\nadded. Murdoch noted that the<br />\nHead Librarian and not the<br />\nVice -President, has final<br />\n<br />\nauthority over book sales. In<br />\naddition, the archivist even<br />\nthough physically located in the<br />\nlibrary, is officially part of the<br />\nAdministration.<br />\n\"Mr. Stam frankly sees no<br />\nintrisinic value in the kinds of<br />\nbooks that are being salvaged<br />\nfrom Gilman,\" stated Alan Fink,<br />\nSC representative.<br />\n<br />\nThe storage area that is<br />\npresently being readied to receive<br />\nthe MSE serials is located in the<br />\nNorth Wing of Gilman, a sector<br />\npreviously air-conditioned and<br />\nhumidified.

He had a paper to<br />\nwrite, which he knew would not<br />\nget written. He stepped onto<br />\nCharles Street, glanced left, then<br />\nright, and ran.<br />\nTwo more years, then Law<br />\nschool. God, two more years of<br />\nthis? What a bore.

What actually<br />\nthis argument is based upon is<br />\ncircular reasoning along with the<br />\nshamefaced assumption about<br />\nthe military dictatorship in Iran.<br />\nMr. Ardalan claims that the King<br />\nor the dictator is the guardian of<br />\nthe country, and at the same<br />\ntime, the symbol of his people.<br />\nThe rich and brutal King, in Mr.<br />\nArdalan's opinion, is the symbol<br />\nof his poor and persecuted \u2022<br />\npeople and since the people are<br />\nperhaps masochist of some sort,<br />\nliking his tortures, they would<br />\nlike him to be up there!<br />\nIn addition, the country's<br />\nnational interest is taken for<br />\ngranted and the Shah's interests<br />\nare arbitrarily supposed to be the<br />\nsame as the people's. In this<br />\nmanner, Mr. Ardalan arrives at<br />\nthe conclusion that the<br />\n\"development \",rresponsibility\",<br />\nand \"growth\" are achieved<br />\naccording to the Shah's order and<br />\neveryone should \"shut up\"!<br />\nWe wish that we were ableito<br />\ndo something of the sort of<br />\nmagic to make Mr. Ardalan wake<br />\nup from his shameful dreams in.<br />\norder to realize that we are living<br />\nin the second half of the<br />\ntwentieth century, not 2500<br />\nyears back.<br />\n<br />\nsee LETTERS, page 9<br />\n<br />\nanother voice<br />\n<br />\nA better academic mix at Hopkins<br />\nBy ROBERT BALLENTINE<br />\nThe recent discussion of the<br />\nadmission policy in the<br />\nNewsletter should be commented<br />\nupon by someone who is<br />\ninvolved in the actual admissions<br />\nprocess. As Advising Coordinator<br />\nfor Biology, I have, over the past<br />\nfive years, been very concerned<br />\nwith the composition of the<br />\nundergraduate body, recognizing<br />\nthe effect that the dominance of<br />\npremeds has upon the general<br />\nundergraduate attitudes. My<br />\ninterest in admissions, therefore,<br />\nhas been generated by my general<br />\nconcern for the undergraduate<br />\neducational program and has<br />\nbeen implemented by my now<br />\nserving a second term on the<br />\nfaculty-student Admissions<br />\nAdvisory Committee. This year,<br />\nso that I might have an inside<br />\nview of the admissions process, I<br />\nhave been one of the faculty<br />\ninterviewers and readers of<br />\nadmissions portfolios.<br />\nFirst, I must state that I feel<br />\nthat the recent news analysis of<br />\nadmission policy in the<br />\nNewsletter is not only<br />\ncontra-productive, but is<br />\npremature at this time. To<br />\nattempt to judge the new<br />\nadmissions mechanism at this<br />\ntime is like trying to judge a cake<br />\nbaking contest when contestants<br />\nhave only begun to assemble the<br />\ningredients. The admissions<br />\nprocess can be divided into three<br />\nmajor operations, the first being<br />\nthe assembly of the applicant<br />\npool. The second is for the<br />\nUniversity Admissions Office to<br />\ndecide which applicants would be<br />\ndesirable members of a new class.<br />\nThe third, and in many ways the<br />\nmost important part of the<br />\nadmission process is the actual<br />\nmatriculation of the new class. It<br />\nis this last feature towards which<br />\nt he efforts of the University<br />\nadmissions group really must be<br />\ndirected if we are to achieve a<br />\nbetter academic mix.<br />\nJohns Hopkins at the present<br />\ntime is in a most favorable<br />\nposition of having a much larger<br />\napplicant pool than is required to<br />\nfill our new classes. We really do<br />\nnot need to be especially<br />\nconcerned at this time about<br />\nattracting more applicants.<br />\nHowever, as the excellent<br />\nanalysis ill the Newsletter by Dr.<br />\nMacksey has pointed out, a<br />\nconsiderable amount can still be<br />\ndone to improve the academic<br />\nmix of the applicant pool. We<br />\nwould very much like to see a<br />\ngreater utilization of the<br />\nnon -science academic<br />\nopportunities at Hopkins, along<br />\nwith those in engineering and the<br />\nbasic sciences. To achieve this<br />\nobjective has always been a major<br />\nconcern of the Admissions<br />\nAdvisory Committee, and the<br />\nCommittee has always welcomed<br />\nsuggestions regarding mechanisms<br />\nwhereby we can attract good<br />\napplicants in the areas of the<br />\nsocial sciences and the<br />\nhumanities. When the breakdown<br />\nof thc present applicant pool is<br />\nreleased I believe it will become<br />\nevident that over the past five<br />\nyears thew has been a slow but<br />\nsignificant improvement in the<br />\nacademic balance of our<br />\napplicants.<br />\n<br />\nAs far as the second phase of<br />\nthe program is concerned, the<br />\nactual selection of the applicants<br />\nto whom we offer admission, we<br />\nare conerned with a process that<br />\nhas been well worked out over<br />\nthe last decade or so by<br />\nadmissions officers everywhere. I<br />\ncannot feel that Johns Hopkins is<br />\nany less effective in being able to<br />\nselect the best candidates than<br />\nany of the other major<br />\nuniversities. I have been<br />\ntremendously impressed<br />\npersonally by the academic<br />\ncaliber of the students who apply<br />\nto Hopkins. One sometimes gets<br />\nthe feeling that the apocryphal<br />\ntechnique of throwing the folders<br />\ndown the stairwell would lead to<br />\nan equally excellent class. There<br />\nare very few applicants who<br />\nwould be out of their depth in<br />\nour high-pressure academic<br />\nenvironment.<br />\nWhether one needs an essay or<br />\nnot in judging a candidate is a<br />\ndebatable point. I acknowledge<br />\nDr. Macksey's point that in an<br />\nessay \"the candidate comes<br />\nthrough as a person.\" Knowing,<br />\nhowever, that school counsellors<br />\nfrequently prep candidates about<br />\nhow to write such essays to<br />\nappeal to admissions committees;<br />\nknowing that these essays are not<br />\nnecessarily written by the<br />\ncandidates themselves, and<br />\nfinally, knowing that what is<br />\nusually written is designed to<br />\n\"sell\" the candidate, I have<br />\nalways regarded these essays as<br />\nonly interesting window dressing.<br />\ncertainly would hesitate to<br />\ndecide the acceptance of a<br />\nstudent on the basis of an essay<br />\nin contrast to the proven<br />\nacademic abilities portrayed by<br />\nrank in class, SAT and<br />\nachievement test scores. Argue if<br />\nyou wish that there is too much<br />\nemphasis in our academic<br />\nundergraduate world on grades,<br />\ngrades are still the name of the<br />\ngame. Brilliance and creativity<br />\nare certainly things we desire to<br />\nsee in all members of our student<br />\nbody, but unless these can, be<br />\neffectively applied toward<br />\nachieving satisfactory academic<br />\n-rank the student will<br />\nunfortunately be denied the<br />\npossibility of post-graduate work.<br />\nWhile all of the personal factors,<br />\nessays, letters of<br />\nrecommendation, or what have<br />\nyou, are important in reaching a<br />\ndecision on acceptance, to my<br />\nway of thinking they are<br />\nprobably secondary to the actual<br />\nscholastic capabilities that the<br />\napplicants demonstrate during<br />\ntheir high school careers.<br />\nI would now like to turn to<br />\nthe third, the most important<br />\nand the least controllable section<br />\nof the admissions process,<br />\nnamely, the decision by the<br />\napplicant that he or she will<br />\ncome when accepted to The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. Those<br />\nwho are at present criticising our<br />\nadmissions policy' are not in a<br />\nposition to estimate whether the<br />\nnewer procedures are more or<br />\nless effective in this realm, since<br />\nthese decisions by the accepted<br />\napplicants still lie in the future.<br />\nWe are only now in the second<br />\nphase of the admission's process.<br />\nHowever, it is towards improving<br />\nour acceptance pattern that I<br />\n<br />\nhave been most enthusiastic<br />\nabout the involvement of the<br />\nfaculty in the interviewing<br />\nprocess. We have changed the<br />\ninterview from one comparable<br />\nto that of a personnel manager<br />\ninterviewing an applicant for a<br />\njob to one in which there is a<br />\nmutual exchange ,of information<br />\nbetween the candidate and the<br />\nUniversity faculty. In all of my<br />\nnearly 100 candidate interviews \u2022<br />\nthis year\u2014I only remember two<br />\nstudents who were unhappy over<br />\nthis change in emphasis. Most of<br />\nthe students were pleased that<br />\nthey could relax in a discussion<br />\nof their academic aims with one<br />\nof the faculty of the university<br />\nthat they were considering<br />\nmatriculating in. The two<br />\nstudents who were dissatisfied<br />\nhad obviously been thoroughly<br />\nprepped by parent or counsellor<br />\nto give a \"performance\" that was<br />\nto convince me that Hopkins<br />\nshould accept them. All the other<br />\nstudents proceeded to ask me<br />\nexceedingly searching questions<br />\nabout the University as a whole\u2014<br />\nacademic and otherwise. Since<br />\nthere is no mechanism at this<br />\ntime whereby students are<br />\nnecessarily interviewed by<br />\nfaculty in their area of major<br />\ninterest, I talked with students<br />\nw h o se major interests spread<br />\nIto in the humanities to the<br />\nsciences. Occasionally they<br />\nwould ask me questions I could<br />\nnot answer but a phone call to<br />\nanother faculty member or<br />\nadministrator usually provided<br />\nme with the specific answers to<br />\ntheir questions. Also, as a faculty<br />\nmember. I could easily establish<br />\ncontact with other faculty, often<br />\nmaking appointments for the<br />\napplicants with _them to discuss<br />\nparticular and special interests. I<br />\nfelt this was most beneficial to<br />\nthe profile \u2022 that the University<br />\npresented to these candidates for<br />\nadmission. This interview process<br />\nis an important and. I think,<br />\neffective Nace where the<br />\nUniversity can \"sell\" its academic<br />\nprograms. The University<br />\nadmissions has to face the fact<br />\nthat we have no problem in<br />\nattracting premeds to come to<br />\nHopkins, competing well with<br />\nevery other major university<br />\n(with the possible exception of<br />\nHarvard). Our problem is to get<br />\nmore of those top students in the<br />\nsocial sciences and humanities<br />\nwho have been accepted at all of<br />\nthe top universities to make a<br />\ndecision in our favor. In addition<br />\nto our reputation in the sciences<br />\nand eirnnattnioedniacline,<br />\nScalniodol oIntf<br />\nAffairs<br />\nWriting Seminars are well known.<br />\nAs a consequence, students in<br />\nthese latter areas also frequently<br />\nhave Hopkins as their fir-St<br />\nchoice. However, in the other<br />\nareas of the social sciences and<br />\nhumanities, such a top position<br />\nin the selection rank<br />\nunfortunately does not exist at<br />\nthis writing. I think that we must<br />\nmake a major effort towards<br />\nimproving our image as a place<br />\nfor an excellent non-science<br />\neducation, an image we now<br />\nenjoy in the sciences.<br />\nAdmittedly, Hopkins has the<br />\npotential to compete effectively<br />\n<br />\nsee VOICE, page 9<br />\n<br />\n\fmarch 23, 1976/news-letter/page la<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n-the ia55 '77<br />\ncQraiaily invitz5 ,\u2018Tti,'60<br />\nour<br />\n<br />\null<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nThe Coleman Awards are presented<br />\n<br />\nVa5<br />\n<br />\nAr'it 10 WrviTV L<br />\n<br />\n- 5RO.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nOS<br />\n<br />\n)41e/t56eeS op wit<br />\ncrab C7ZIQ<br />\n<br />\nei?<br />\n<br />\nto recognize the achievements of the \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\ny's<br />\nfinest writers.

Old folk<br />\ntraditionals like \"Gypsy Davy,\"<br />\n\"Pretty Boy Floyd\" and<br />\n\"Stealin';\" Arlo's own \"Comin'<br />\ninto Los Angeles.\" \"Motorcycle<br />\nSong\" and \"Washington<br />\nCounty\", reworked versions of<br />\nthe Beatles' \"I've just Seen a<br />\nFace\" and the Stones'<br />\n\"Connection.\"<br />\nGuthrie chatted frequently<br />\nbetween songs and was especially<br />\nengaging during an audience<br />\nsing-along. After he explained the<br />\nsong, the audience was wild with<br />\napplause. Guthrie smiled and<br />\nsaid, \"You should never clap<br />\nbefore you hear the tune, that's<br />\nhow we elected Nixon,<br />\nremember? And I guess that's<br />\nhow we'll elect Jimmy Carter<br />\ntoo.\" The crowd was in the<br />\naisles. Knowing he had a good<br />\nthing going, Guthrie continued,<br />\n\"Boy, it wouldn't be bad at all in<br />\nthe White House. I'd hang out all<br />\nday, shoot pool and smoke clean<br />\ndope. Presidents get things like<br />\nthat you know. I'll bet Nixon<br />\ndidn't know that seeds come<br />\n\u2018vith.the stuff.\"<br />\nAfter several encores, Guthrie<br />\n<br />\nand Shenandoah closed,<br />\npredictably enough, with Woody<br />\nGuthrie's famed anthem, \"This<br />\nLand is Your Land.\" The<br />\naudience rose to its feet, clapping<br />\nand singing along with the band.<br />\nClimaxing the concert was<br />\nFred Harris' surprise appearance<br />\non stage, just before ten o'clock.<br />\nHarris, who was surrounded with<br />\nsecret service men, spoke for a<br />\nfew minutes to the obviously<br />\npartisan crowd. \"You know, my<br />\nnext race is in Pennsylvania<br />\nwhere I'll be running against<br />\nHenry Jackson. Jackson was just<br />\nendorsed by Philadelphia's<br />\nMayor, Frank Rizzo. I think<br />\nthat'll cause him more trouble<br />\nthan me. And I hear Jackson will<br />\nmake Rizzo Director of the IRS<br />\nand Pat Moynihan Secretary of<br />\nState. Friends, it looks like we<br />\ncould be in tough shape.\"<br />\nAfter the performances, teen<br />\naged girls were cooing that<br />\n\"Arlo's just a doll\" and sneaking<br />\nglances into the folkie's dressing<br />\nroom. One young man was heard<br />\nto say, \"Yeah, that was worth<br />\nfive bucks,for sure.\"<br />\nEven the most ardent Harris<br />\nsupporters admit that the former<br />\nOklahoma Senator's campaign is<br />\njust about dead, but for one<br />\nnight at least, Arlo Guthrie and<br />\nco. showed that sometimes this<br />\nland is really made for you and<br />\nni<br />\n<br />\nEpitome of versatility, king of cool<br />\nthe audience a joke. While this<br />\nBy LEO GORCEY<br />\nmay offend some purist, it's just<br />\nThe man is so hip, it's a<br />\nan essential part of the Gillespie<br />\nwonder he didn't fracture<br />\nhimself. \"I am the epitome of personality, and his fans have<br />\nlearned to expect the<br />\nincorruptibility,\".

Therefore,<br />\nany reference to the growth rate<br />\nof GNP, especially during the<br />\nperiod of sudden increase in oil<br />\nprices, as an accidental and<br />\nexogenous factor, will be an<br />\nempty talk. In addition, the<br />\ncomparison of the GNP growth<br />\nrate of an industrialized nation<br />\nWith an under- developed<br />\ncountry stems from the lack of<br />\neconomic knowledge at its<br />\nprimitive level or it is perhaps on<br />\nintentional ignorance.<br />\nTo explain the so-called<br />\nrevolutionary reform programs of<br />\n\"His Imperial Majesty\", claimed<br />\nby Mr. Ardalan, let us not<br />\ninclude the technical, economic,<br />\npolitical and social studies done<br />\nby the great number of informed<br />\nindependent sources and just<br />\nquote few findings for the<br />\ngeneral reader.<br />\nAs Harper's of Nov., 1974,<br />\nindicates, \"In Tehran two-thirds<br />\nof all families have an income of<br />\nless than 8200 per person (per<br />\nyear).\" In regards to the rural<br />\nareas the same source reports,<br />\n\"There is widespread<br />\nmalnutrition, the average calorie<br />\nintake in Iran is about the same<br />\nas India's, and the rural people<br />\nsuffer from all the diseases that<br />\ncome with such condition.\" In<br />\nthe same context Newsweek of<br />\nMarch 24, 1975 particularly<br />\nwrites, \"If you travel by car from<br />\nnorthern Tehran to the<br />\ncountryside, noted one long-time<br />\nAmerican resident last week, you<br />\ncan go back centuries in an<br />\nhour.\" The same source reports,<br />\n\"Today, 10% of Iran's<br />\n'population still control nearly<br />\nhalf of the country's wealth. As<br />\nadditional embarrassment the<br />\nShah's five-year plan for<br />\nagriculture has failed to keep<br />\npace with the country's birth<br />\nrates, and 60% of Iranians, are<br />\nstill illiterate.\"<br />\n\"This year\" Harper's of Nov.<br />\n1974 reports, \"Iranian<br />\nuniversities graduated about<br />\n18,000 students fewer than<br />\nSyria, (whose population is a<br />\nfifth of Iran's) and about 600<br />\ndoctors.\" The same source fianlly<br />\nconcludes, \"The reason for all<br />\nthis is simply that the Shah has<br />\nnever made a serious attempt at<br />\ndevelopment.\"<br />\nIn the Shah's opinion perhaps<br />\na serious attempt at development<br />\nis an ever increasing rate of the<br />\narms purchase. In this manner,<br />\neconomic and social development<br />\nfor \"Imperial Highness\" Ashraf,<br />\n<br />\n\"His Excellenncy\" Ambassador<br />\nZahedi, arid Mr. Ardalan<br />\nmarketing of drugs, the greater<br />\nincrease in the secret budget of<br />\nthe Embassy on a higher level of<br />\nthe jet-set life, and the increasing<br />\nshare of, for instance, caviar<br />\nreceive respectively.<br />\nRegarding the<br />\nword<br />\n\"terrorism\" for our\" good<br />\ncounselor and, in fact for the<br />\nShah's regime has a new meaning.<br />\nThis includes any action actually<br />\ntaken or intended to be taken.by<br />\nanyone at any capacity against<br />\nthe Shah's one-party system.<br />\nAfter the creation of the<br />\nso-called National Resurgence<br />\nParty, by the Shah, the<br />\nEconomist of March 8, 1975<br />\nwrote, \"All Iranians who believe<br />\nin the three principles of the<br />\nmonarchy, the constitution (it is<br />\nchanging according to the Shah's<br />\nwish day by day), and the Shah's<br />\n\"White Revolution\" must join<br />\nthe new party. Anybody who<br />\ndoes not accept these principles,<br />\nhe declared, should leave the<br />\ncountry or go to jail.<br />\nMr. Ardalan ironically<br />\nsuggested that Iranian students<br />\nshould go back and take an<br />\n\"active\" part in the reforms in<br />\nIran. This includes involvement<br />\nin building more prisons and<br />\ntorture houses, preaching the<br />\nPrinciples of the dictatorship and<br />\nthe \"legitimized\" forms of<br />\nmurdering Iranian people.<br />\nAccording to the Village Voice<br />\nof February 2, 1976, \"As Nuni<br />\nAlbala, a French lawyer who has<br />\ndone investigative work in the<br />\nluminous land of the Shah<br />\nreported in Le Monde, \"The<br />\nregime has accomplished a tour<br />\nde force in achieving a more<br />\nrapid rate of construction for<br />\nprisons than for schools.\" For<br />\nyour information, Mr. Ardalan,<br />\nstudents will eventually go back..<br />\nBut in what part they will take<br />\nactive roles it remains to be seen.<br />\nMr. Ardalan seems to be<br />\nsuffering severely from some<br />\nkind of melancholia in regards to<br />\nthe number and the position of<br />\nIranian students. He apparently<br />\nthinks that the Iranian masked<br />\nstudents who are politically<br />\nconscious in understanding their<br />\nhistorical mission and courageous<br />\nenough not to be submitted to<br />\nthe temptations of the Embassy's<br />\nleft-over in forms of all kinds or<br />\nsome other place of that sort!<br />\nThe Iranian students, Mr.<br />\nArdalan, are real Iranians, and<br />\ndon't intend to fight against Iran.<br />\nThey would rather struggle and<br />\nresist against the Shah's<br />\ndictatorial regime. As for the<br />\nforeign policy of Iran, Mr.<br />\nAirdalan makes a fool out of<br />\nhimself when he considers Iran as<br />\n\"the bastion of stability and<br />\nsecurity\". The island of stability<br />\nand security, as he calls, turned<br />\nto be the largest warehouse of<br />\nthe military hardware and the<br />\nintelligence of the Middle East<br />\njust because of the fact that the<br />\nnature of the Shah's dictatorship<br />\nis not capable of facing the<br />\nstruggle of the Iranian people. At<br />\nthe same time, the Shah's army<br />\nhas long been engaged in killing<br />\nthe people of the neighboring<br />\nOman.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Ardalan claims that the<br />\nShah is \"condemning the<br />\nacquisition of any country's<br />\nterritory by force and supporting<br />\nthe peaceful resolution of the<br />\nMiddle East or any regional<br />\nconflicts.\" Unfortunately Mr.<br />\nArdalan's memory has<br />\ncompletely worn out in<br />\nremembering the event of only<br />\nfour years ago that the Shah's<br />\nforce and navy captured the<br />\nisland of Abu Mousa and the two<br />\nothers by force.<br />\nTo conclude, let us ask our<br />\nreaders to pass judgment upon<br />\nour question: Is Mr. Ardalan a<br />\nbuffoon of the lowest kind or on<br />\nthe contrary he is the man of<br />\nhonor in presenting \"a more<br />\nhonest picture of conditions in<br />\nIran\"?<br />\nIranian Students Association in<br />\nWashington-Baltimore<br />\n<br />\nSaga<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI appreciate the concern<br />\nshown by Alan Steinberg over<br />\nthe adequacy of my Saga diet,<br />\nbut he need not worry.

This is my ivew<br />\nof the News-Letter's ramblings<br />\nregarding the SC.<br />\nThe Student Council<br />\ndemonstrated its willingness to<br />\nreceive constructive suggestions<br />\nby holding an open forum. The<br />\nmajority of those attending this<br />\nmeeting were from the<br />\nNews-Letter. We listened to the<br />\nsuggestions made, which were<br />\nvalid, and plan to act on them.<br />\nHowever, these few suggestions<br />\nwould only amplify the<br />\neffectivenss of the Council, they<br />\n<br />\nwould not correct any of the.<br />\n\"evils\" implied in N-L articles<br />\nand editorials.<br />\nI have never heard the<br />\nNews-Letter voice, what you feel<br />\nto be, the specific neptive<br />\naspects of this year's Council.<br />\nIndividuals have not been singled<br />\nout as performing poorly. Yet,<br />\nyour editorial of March 16 makes<br />\nthe highly irresponsible<br />\ncomment, \"We can take this<br />\npositive view: compared to this<br />\nyear's Student Council, we can't<br />\nlose.\" There are a lot of people<br />\nworking damn hard on the<br />\nCouncil and I don't think they<br />\ndeserve to be included in such as<br />\noverly generalized statement. The<br />\nonly conclusion I am able to<br />\ndraw is that the News-Letter is<br />\nguilty of having the same petty<br />\npersonal conflicts with some<br />\nmembers of the SC, as have been<br />\nattributed by the paper to the<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nIf the News-Letter really<br />\nbelieves that the Student Council<br />\nshould be a viable body and that<br />\nstudent opinions must be<br />\nrepresented, you're doing a good<br />\njob of disguising that fact! The<br />\ncuts made on the Council have<br />\nbeen aimed at the body, not at<br />\nindividuals.

Three infield<br />\nmiscues enabled the Bears to<br />\ntally three unearned runs on only<br />\n<br />\none hit and establish a 9-6<br />\nadvantage.<br />\nThe Jays, however, continued<br />\nto battle back. In the top of the<br />\neighth, a walk, a single, and a<br />\nfielder's choice and<br />\nrun-producing singles by Lewing<br />\nand Pedroni helped pull Hopkins<br />\nto within one,9-8.<br />\nMorgan was held scoreless in<br />\nthe home half of the eighth and<br />\nHopkins came to its last at bat<br />\nstill trailing by a run.<br />\nDesignated -hitter John<br />\nJerabeck opened the top of the<br />\nninth with a ground single up the<br />\nmiddle.

Most Hopkins students<br />\ntend to see golf as an elitist game<br />\nlimited to those who spent their<br />\nformative years lounging about<br />\nthe country club pool trying to<br />\ncatch the eye of a bored<br />\nsuburban housewife and then<br />\nsauntering over to the pro shop<br />\nand charging the green fees to<br />\nDad's tab, making sure the golf<br />\ncart is well-stocked with<br />\nsix-packs. Or there is the even<br />\nmore fallacious notion that<br />\ngolfers are in some way inferior,<br />\nsissified weaklings with a mental<br />\ndefect that allows them to<br />\ntolerate the inexorable dullness<br />\nof the game.<br />\nComdination<br />\n\"That's absolutely false,\"<br />\ncomments Hopkins golf coach<br />\nWin Smith. \"In golf, there is a<br />\ncertain interaction between man<br />\nand nature, and between man<br />\nand himself. Golf is also a game<br />\nthat requires great strength and<br />\ncoordination but even more<br />\nimportantly, coordination<br />\nbetween mind and body.\"<br />\n\"What attracted me to golf<br />\nwas the solitariness of the game,\"<br />\nreturning letterman Mike Deak<br />\nsays. \"Golf is the most honorable<br />\nsport I know. Golfers are so<br />\nmuch more civilized than those<br />\nuncouth Neo-neanderthals that<br />\nroam the lacrosse fields at will.\"<br />\nLast year the Hopkins golf<br />\nteam coasted to an 8-5 record, its<br />\nbest season in seven years. But<br />\nthis year's team, according to<br />\nSmith, a Hopkins graduate<br />\nhimself, has even greater<br />\npotential. \"We are looking to win<br />\nthe MAC championship an to<br />\ngain a berth in the NCAA<br />\nDivision III finals.

Many of the<br />\nnation's finest college teams,<br />\nincluding the Univeristy of<br />\nFlorida, will be competing. \"The<br />\nFlorida trip provides us a good<br />\nchance to gain top-notch<br />\ncompetition and a head start on<br />\nthe long road to the MAC<br />\nchampionships.\"<br />\nLast Saturday in an exhibition<br />\nmatch, the Hopkins golf team<br />\ndefeated the University of<br />\nSoutheastern Massachusetts, 421<br />\nto 436. \"I'm very pleased that<br />\nour squad soundly beat a team<br />\nthat went to the NAIA<br />\nchampsionships last fall,\" Smith<br />\nboasted.

Benton elaborated that<br />\n\"there had been some breakdown<br />\nill communication between the<br />\nlibrary hierarchy. Kathryn Jacobs<br />\n(university archivist) and my<br /><br />\noffice.\" Apparently, no attempt<br />\nwas made to view books for their<br />\narchival worth. \"Plainly, the<br />\nbooks were never opened,\" said<br />\nSC representative Leah<br />\nSeidenfeld.<br />\nAlthough questions exists<br />\nwhether the library ever<br />\nevaluated the hooks, Associate<br />\nLibrarian David Taylor stated<br />\nthat the basic contention<br />\ntween the library and students<br />\nis what should be considered<br />\nassociational value\u2014that is, books<br />\nwith an autograph of a famous<br />\nscholar, annotation from a<br />\nHopkins scholar, or a book from<br />\nthe personal collection of a major<br />\npersonage.<br />\n\"In my view applying the term<br />\narchival freely is misusing the<br />\nterm,\" stated Taylor. \"Usually<br />\nthe books in the index collection<br />\n(that group of volumes for sale)<br />\nare duplicates and once you<br />\ndecide that a book is significant<br />\nenough to become part of a<br />\npermanent collection it costs<br />\nsomething to add it.\"<br />\nA similar problem occurred<br />\nlast summer when the library<br />\nsold a large set of books to the<br />\nJohn Gach book store.

The only clear thing, however, revealed by last week's<br />\nStudent Council primary is an inability to vote by most of<br />\nthe undergraduate body..<br />\nLike last year, a majority of theistudents did not bother to<br />\nparticipate in the electoral process. In an election where some<br />\nof the candidates lost by so few votes you could count them<br />\non your fingers, the inactivity of over a thousand votes<br />\nseems, at the very least, an awful shame.

What actually<br />\nthis argument is based upon is<br />\ncircular reasoning along with the<br />\nshamefaced assumption about<br />\nthe military dictatorship in Iran.<br />\nMr. Ardalan claims that the King<br />\nor the dictator is the guardian of<br />\nthe country, and at the same<br />\ntime, the symbol of his people.<br />\nThe rich and brutal King, in Mr.<br />\nArdalan's opinion, is the symbol<br />\nof his poor and persecuted \u2022<br />\npeople and since the people are<br />\nperhaps masochist of some sort,<br />\nliking his tortures, they would<br />\nlike him to be up there!<br />\nIn addition, the country's<br />\nnational interest is taken for<br />\ngranted and the Shah's interests<br />\nare arbitrarily supposed to be the<br />\nsame as the people's. In this<br />\nmanner, Mr. Ardalan arrives at<br />\nthe conclusion that the<br />\n\"development \",rresponsibility\",<br />\nand \"growth\" are achieved<br />\naccording to the Shah's order and<br />\neveryone should \"shut up\"!<br />\nWe wish that we were ableito<br />\ndo something of the sort of<br />\nmagic to make Mr. Ardalan wake<br />\nup from his shameful dreams in.<br />\norder to realize that we are living<br />\nin the second half of the<br />\ntwentieth century, not 2500<br />\nyears back.<br /><br />\nsee LETTERS, page 9<br /><br />\nanother voice<br /><br />\nA better academic mix at Hopkins<br />\nBy ROBERT BALLENTINE<br />\nThe recent discussion of the<br />\nadmission policy in the<br />\nNewsletter should be commented<br />\nupon by someone who is<br />\ninvolved in the actual admissions<br />\nprocess. As Advising Coordinator<br />\nfor Biology, I have, over the past<br />\nfive years, been very concerned<br />\nwith the composition of the<br />\nundergraduate body, recognizing<br />\nthe effect that the dominance of<br />\npremeds has upon the general<br />\nundergraduate attitudes. My<br />\ninterest in admissions, therefore,<br />\nhas been generated by my general<br />\nconcern for the undergraduate<br />\neducational program and has<br />\nbeen implemented by my now<br />\nserving a second term on the<br />\nfaculty-student Admissions<br />\nAdvisory Committee. This year,<br />\nso that I might have an inside<br />\nview of the admissions process, I<br />\nhave been one of the faculty<br />\ninterviewers and readers of<br />\nadmissions portfolios.<br />\nFirst, I must state that I feel<br />\nthat the recent news analysis of<br />\nadmission policy in the<br />\nNewsletter is not only<br />\ncontra-productive, but is<br />\npremature at this time. To<br />\nattempt to judge the new<br />\nadmissions mechanism at this<br />\ntime is like trying to judge a cake<br />\nbaking contest when contestants<br />\nhave only begun to assemble the<br />\ningredients. The admissions<br />\nprocess can be divided into three<br />\nmajor operations, the first being<br />\nthe assembly of the applicant<br />\npool. The second is for the<br />\nUniversity Admissions Office to<br />\ndecide which applicants would be<br />\ndesirable members of a new class.<br />\nThe third, and in many ways the<br />\nmost important part of the<br />\nadmission process is the actual<br />\nmatriculation of the new class. It<br />\nis this last feature towards which<br />\nt he efforts of the University<br />\nadmissions group really must be<br />\ndirected if we are to achieve a<br />\nbetter academic mix.<br />\nJohns Hopkins at the present<br />\ntime is in a most favorable<br />\nposition of having a much larger<br />\napplicant pool than is required to<br />\nfill our new classes. We really do<br />\nnot need to be especially<br />\nconcerned at this time about<br />\nattracting more applicants.<br />\nHowever, as the excellent<br />\nanalysis ill the Newsletter by Dr.<br />\nMacksey has pointed out, a<br />\nconsiderable amount can still be<br />\ndone to improve the academic<br />\nmix of the applicant pool. We<br />\nwould very much like to see a<br />\ngreater utilization of the<br />\nnon -science academic<br />\nopportunities at Hopkins, along<br />\nwith those in engineering and the<br />\nbasic sciences. To achieve this<br />\nobjective has always been a major<br />\nconcern of the Admissions<br />\nAdvisory Committee, and the<br />\nCommittee has always welcomed<br />\nsuggestions regarding mechanisms<br />\nwhereby we can attract good<br />\napplicants in the areas of the<br />\nsocial sciences and the<br />\nhumanities. When the breakdown<br />\nof thc present applicant pool is<br />\nreleased I believe it will become<br />\nevident that over the past five<br />\nyears thew has been a slow but<br />\nsignificant improvement in the<br />\nacademic balance of our<br />\napplicants.<br /><br />\nAs far as the second phase of<br />\nthe program is concerned, the<br />\nactual selection of the applicants<br />\nto whom we offer admission, we<br />\nare conerned with a process that<br />\nhas been well worked out over<br />\nthe last decade or so by<br />\nadmissions officers everywhere. I<br />\ncannot feel that Johns Hopkins is<br />\nany less effective in being able to<br />\nselect the best candidates than<br />\nany of the other major<br />\nuniversities. I have been<br />\ntremendously impressed<br />\npersonally by the academic<br />\ncaliber of the students who apply<br />\nto Hopkins. One sometimes gets<br />\nthe feeling that the apocryphal<br />\ntechnique of throwing the folders<br />\ndown the stairwell would lead to<br />\nan equally excellent class. There<br />\nare very few applicants who<br />\nwould be out of their depth in<br />\nour high-pressure academic<br />\nenvironment.<br />\nWhether one needs an essay or<br />\nnot in judging a candidate is a<br />\ndebatable point. I acknowledge<br />\nDr. Macksey's point that in an<br />\nessay \"the candidate comes<br />\nthrough as a person.\" Knowing,<br />\nhowever, that school counsellors<br />\nfrequently prep candidates about<br />\nhow to write such essays to<br />\nappeal to admissions committees;<br />\nknowing that these essays are not<br />\nnecessarily written by the<br />\ncandidates themselves, and<br />\nfinally, knowing that what is<br />\nusually written is designed to<br />\n\"sell\" the candidate, I have<br />\nalways regarded these essays as<br />\nonly interesting window dressing.<br />\ncertainly would hesitate to<br />\ndecide the acceptance of a<br />\nstudent on the basis of an essay<br />\nin contrast to the proven<br />\nacademic abilities portrayed by<br />\nrank in class, SAT and<br />\nachievement test scores. Argue if<br />\nyou wish that there is too much<br />\nemphasis in our academic<br />\nundergraduate world on grades,<br />\ngrades are still the name of the<br />\ngame. Brilliance and creativity<br />\nare certainly things we desire to<br />\nsee in all members of our student<br />\nbody, but unless these can, be<br />\neffectively applied toward<br />\nachieving satisfactory academic<br />\n-rank the student will<br />\nunfortunately be denied the<br />\npossibility of post-graduate work.<br />\nWhile all of the personal factors,<br />\nessays, letters of<br />\nrecommendation, or what have<br />\nyou, are important in reaching a<br />\ndecision on acceptance, to my<br />\nway of thinking they are<br />\nprobably secondary to the actual<br />\nscholastic capabilities that the<br />\napplicants demonstrate during<br />\ntheir high school careers.<br />\nI would now like to turn to<br />\nthe third, the most important<br />\nand the least controllable section<br />\nof the admissions process,<br />\nnamely, the decision by the<br />\napplicant that he or she will<br />\ncome when accepted to The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. Those<br />\nwho are at present criticising our<br />\nadmissions policy' are not in a<br />\nposition to estimate whether the<br />\nnewer procedures are more or<br />\nless effective in this realm, since<br />\nthese decisions by the accepted<br />\napplicants still lie in the future.<br />\nWe are only now in the second<br />\nphase of the admission's process.<br />\nHowever, it is towards improving<br />\nour acceptance pattern that I<br /><br />\nhave been most enthusiastic<br />\nabout the involvement of the<br />\nfaculty in the interviewing<br />\nprocess. We have changed the<br />\ninterview from one comparable<br />\nto that of a personnel manager<br />\ninterviewing an applicant for a<br />\njob to one in which there is a<br />\nmutual exchange ,of information<br />\nbetween the candidate and the<br />\nUniversity faculty. In all of my<br />\nnearly 100 candidate interviews \u2022<br />\nthis year\u2014I only remember two<br />\nstudents who were unhappy over<br />\nthis change in emphasis. Most of<br />\nthe students were pleased that<br />\nthey could relax in a discussion<br />\nof their academic aims with one<br />\nof the faculty of the university<br />\nthat they were considering<br />\nmatriculating in. The two<br />\nstudents who were dissatisfied<br />\nhad obviously been thoroughly<br />\nprepped by parent or counsellor<br />\nto give a \"performance\" that was<br />\nto convince me that Hopkins<br />\nshould accept them. All the other<br />\nstudents proceeded to ask me<br />\nexceedingly searching questions<br />\nabout the University as a whole\u2014<br />\nacademic and otherwise. Since<br />\nthere is no mechanism at this<br />\ntime whereby students are<br />\nnecessarily interviewed by<br />\nfaculty in their area of major<br />\ninterest, I talked with students<br />\nw h o se major interests spread<br />\nIto in the humanities to the<br />\nsciences. Occasionally they<br />\nwould ask me questions I could<br />\nnot answer but a phone call to<br />\nanother faculty member or<br />\nadministrator usually provided<br />\nme with the specific answers to<br />\ntheir questions. Also, as a faculty<br />\nmember. I could easily establish<br />\ncontact with other faculty, often<br />\nmaking appointments for the<br />\napplicants with _them to discuss<br />\nparticular and special interests. I<br />\nfelt this was most beneficial to<br />\nthe profile \u2022 that the University<br />\npresented to these candidates for<br />\nadmission. This interview process<br />\nis an important and. I think,<br />\neffective Nace where the<br />\nUniversity can \"sell\" its academic<br />\nprograms. The University<br />\nadmissions has to face the fact<br />\nthat we have no problem in<br />\nattracting premeds to come to<br />\nHopkins, competing well with<br />\nevery other major university<br />\n(with the possible exception of<br />\nHarvard). Our problem is to get<br />\nmore of those top students in the<br />\nsocial sciences and humanities<br />\nwho have been accepted at all of<br />\nthe top universities to make a<br />\ndecision in our favor. In addition<br />\nto our reputation in the sciences<br />\nand eirnnattnioedniacline,<br />\nScalniodol oIntf<br />\nAffairs<br />\nWriting Seminars are well known.<br />\nAs a consequence, students in<br />\nthese latter areas also frequently<br />\nhave Hopkins as their fir-St<br />\nchoice. However, in the other<br />\nareas of the social sciences and<br />\nhumanities, such a top position<br />\nin the selection rank<br />\nunfortunately does not exist at<br />\nthis writing. I think that we must<br />\nmake a major effort towards<br />\nimproving our image as a place<br />\nfor an excellent non-science<br />\neducation, an image we now<br />\nenjoy in the sciences.<br />\nAdmittedly, Hopkins has the<br />\npotential to compete effectively<br /><br />\nsee VOICE, page 9<br /><br />\nmarch 23, 1976/news-letter/page la<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n-the ia55 '77<br />\ncQraiaily invitz5 ,\u2018Tti,'60<br />\nour<br /><br />\null<br />\n3<br /><br />\nThe Coleman Awards are presented<br /><br />\nVa5<br /><br />\nAr'it 10 WrviTV L<br /><br />\n- 5RO.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nOS<br /><br />\n)41e/t56eeS op wit<br />\ncrab C7ZIQ<br /><br />\nei?<br /><br />\nto recognize the achievements of the \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\ny's<br />\nfinest writers.

Therefore,<br />\nany reference to the growth rate<br />\nof GNP, especially during the<br />\nperiod of sudden increase in oil<br />\nprices, as an accidental and<br />\nexogenous factor, will be an<br />\nempty talk. In addition, the<br />\ncomparison of the GNP growth<br />\nrate of an industrialized nation<br />\nWith an under- developed<br />\ncountry stems from the lack of<br />\neconomic knowledge at its<br />\nprimitive level or it is perhaps on<br />\nintentional ignorance.<br />\nTo explain the so-called<br />\nrevolutionary reform programs of<br />\n\"His Imperial Majesty\", claimed<br />\nby Mr. Ardalan, let us not<br />\ninclude the technical, economic,<br />\npolitical and social studies done<br />\nby the great number of informed<br />\nindependent sources and just<br />\nquote few findings for the<br />\ngeneral reader.<br />\nAs Harper's of Nov., 1974,<br />\nindicates, \"In Tehran two-thirds<br />\nof all families have an income of<br />\nless than 8200 per person (per<br />\nyear).\" In regards to the rural<br />\nareas the same source reports,<br />\n\"There is widespread<br />\nmalnutrition, the average calorie<br />\nintake in Iran is about the same<br />\nas India's, and the rural people<br />\nsuffer from all the diseases that<br />\ncome with such condition.\" In<br />\nthe same context Newsweek of<br />\nMarch 24, 1975 particularly<br />\nwrites, \"If you travel by car from<br />\nnorthern Tehran to the<br />\ncountryside, noted one long-time<br />\nAmerican resident last week, you<br />\ncan go back centuries in an<br />\nhour.\" The same source reports,<br />\n\"Today, 10% of Iran's<br />\n'population still control nearly<br />\nhalf of the country's wealth. As<br />\nadditional embarrassment the<br />\nShah's five-year plan for<br />\nagriculture has failed to keep<br />\npace with the country's birth<br />\nrates, and 60% of Iranians, are<br />\nstill illiterate.\"<br />\n\"This year\" Harper's of Nov.<br />\n1974 reports, \"Iranian<br />\nuniversities graduated about<br />\n18,000 students fewer than<br />\nSyria, (whose population is a<br />\nfifth of Iran's) and about 600<br />\ndoctors.\" The same source fianlly<br />\nconcludes, \"The reason for all<br />\nthis is simply that the Shah has<br />\nnever made a serious attempt at<br />\ndevelopment.\"<br />\nIn the Shah's opinion perhaps<br />\na serious attempt at development<br />\nis an ever increasing rate of the<br />\narms purchase. In this manner,<br />\neconomic and social development<br />\nfor \"Imperial Highness\" Ashraf,<br /><br />\n\"His Excellenncy\" Ambassador<br />\nZahedi, arid Mr. Ardalan<br />\nmarketing of drugs, the greater<br />\nincrease in the secret budget of<br />\nthe Embassy on a higher level of<br />\nthe jet-set life, and the increasing<br />\nshare of, for instance, caviar<br />\nreceive respectively.<br />\nRegarding the<br />\nword<br />\n\"terrorism\" for our\" good<br />\ncounselor and, in fact for the<br />\nShah's regime has a new meaning.<br />\nThis includes any action actually<br />\ntaken or intended to be taken.by<br />\nanyone at any capacity against<br />\nthe Shah's one-party system.<br />\nAfter the creation of the<br />\nso-called National Resurgence<br />\nParty, by the Shah, the<br />\nEconomist of March 8, 1975<br />\nwrote, \"All Iranians who believe<br />\nin the three principles of the<br />\nmonarchy, the constitution (it is<br />\nchanging according to the Shah's<br />\nwish day by day), and the Shah's<br />\n\"White Revolution\" must join<br />\nthe new party. Anybody who<br />\ndoes not accept these principles,<br />\nhe declared, should leave the<br />\ncountry or go to jail.<br />\nMr. Ardalan ironically<br />\nsuggested that Iranian students<br />\nshould go back and take an<br />\n\"active\" part in the reforms in<br />\nIran. This includes involvement<br />\nin building more prisons and<br />\ntorture houses, preaching the<br />\nPrinciples of the dictatorship and<br />\nthe \"legitimized\" forms of<br />\nmurdering Iranian people.<br />\nAccording to the Village Voice<br />\nof February 2, 1976, \"As Nuni<br />\nAlbala, a French lawyer who has<br />\ndone investigative work in the<br />\nluminous land of the Shah<br />\nreported in Le Monde, \"The<br />\nregime has accomplished a tour<br />\nde force in achieving a more<br />\nrapid rate of construction for<br />\nprisons than for schools.\" For<br />\nyour information, Mr. Ardalan,<br />\nstudents will eventually go back..<br />\nBut in what part they will take<br />\nactive roles it remains to be seen.<br />\nMr. Ardalan seems to be<br />\nsuffering severely from some<br />\nkind of melancholia in regards to<br />\nthe number and the position of<br />\nIranian students. He apparently<br />\nthinks that the Iranian masked<br />\nstudents who are politically<br />\nconscious in understanding their<br />\nhistorical mission and courageous<br />\nenough not to be submitted to<br />\nthe temptations of the Embassy's<br />\nleft-over in forms of all kinds or<br />\nsome other place of that sort!<br />\nThe Iranian students, Mr.<br />\nArdalan, are real Iranians, and<br />\ndon't intend to fight against Iran.<br />\nThey would rather struggle and<br />\nresist against the Shah's<br />\ndictatorial regime. As for the<br />\nforeign policy of Iran, Mr.<br />\nAirdalan makes a fool out of<br />\nhimself when he considers Iran as<br />\n\"the bastion of stability and<br />\nsecurity\". The island of stability<br />\nand security, as he calls, turned<br />\nto be the largest warehouse of<br />\nthe military hardware and the<br />\nintelligence of the Middle East<br />\njust because of the fact that the<br />\nnature of the Shah's dictatorship<br />\nis not capable of facing the<br />\nstruggle of the Iranian people. At<br />\nthe same time, the Shah's army<br />\nhas long been engaged in killing<br />\nthe people of the neighboring<br />\nOman.<br /><br />\nMr. Ardalan claims that the<br />\nShah is \"condemning the<br />\nacquisition of any country's<br />\nterritory by force and supporting<br />\nthe peaceful resolution of the<br />\nMiddle East or any regional<br />\nconflicts.\" Unfortunately Mr.<br />\nArdalan's memory has<br />\ncompletely worn out in<br />\nremembering the event of only<br />\nfour years ago that the Shah's<br />\nforce and navy captured the<br />\nisland of Abu Mousa and the two<br />\nothers by force.<br />\nTo conclude, let us ask our<br />\nreaders to pass judgment upon<br />\nour question: Is Mr. Ardalan a<br />\nbuffoon of the lowest kind or on<br />\nthe contrary he is the man of<br />\nhonor in presenting \"a more<br />\nhonest picture of conditions in<br />\nIran\"?<br />\nIranian Students Association in<br />\nWashington-Baltimore<br /><br />\nSaga<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI appreciate the concern<br />\nshown by Alan Steinberg over<br />\nthe adequacy of my Saga diet,<br />\nbut he need not worry.

As a member<br />\nof the Student Council, I can<br />\naccept criticism.

This is my ivew<br />\nof the News-Letter's ramblings<br />\nregarding the SC.<br />\nThe Student Council<br />\ndemonstrated its willingness to<br />\nreceive constructive suggestions<br />\nby holding an open forum. The<br />\nmajority of those attending this<br />\nmeeting were from the<br />\nNews-Letter. We listened to the<br />\nsuggestions made, which were<br />\nvalid, and plan to act on them.<br />\nHowever, these few suggestions<br />\nwould only amplify the<br />\neffectivenss of the Council, they<br /><br />\nwould not correct any of the.<br />\n\"evils\" implied in N-L articles<br />\nand editorials.<br />\nI have never heard the<br />\nNews-Letter voice, what you feel<br />\nto be, the specific neptive<br />\naspects of this year's Council.<br />\nIndividuals have not been singled<br />\nout as performing poorly. Yet,<br />\nyour editorial of March 16 makes<br />\nthe highly irresponsible<br />\ncomment, \"We can take this<br />\npositive view: compared to this<br />\nyear's Student Council, we can't<br />\nlose.\" There are a lot of people<br />\nworking damn hard on the<br />\nCouncil and I don't think they<br />\ndeserve to be included in such as<br />\noverly generalized statement. The<br />\nonly conclusion I am able to<br />\ndraw is that the News-Letter is<br />\nguilty of having the same petty<br />\npersonal conflicts with some<br />\nmembers of the SC, as have been<br />\nattributed by the paper to the<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nIf the News-Letter really<br />\nbelieves that the Student Council<br />\nshould be a viable body and that<br />\nstudent opinions must be<br />\nrepresented, you're doing a good<br />\njob of disguising that fact! The<br />\ncuts made on the Council have<br />\nbeen aimed at the body, not at<br />\nindividuals. Tearing down the SC<br />\nas a functioning body, in the eyes<br />\nof the administration, faculty,<br />\nand students, only serves to<br />\nweaken the foundations of<br />\nstudent government at Hopkins,<br />\nthis year and next year.<br />\nIf there are specific<br />\ncomplaints , let's hear them.

Most Hopkins students<br />\ntend to see golf as an elitist game<br />\nlimited to those who spent their<br />\nformative years lounging about<br />\nthe country club pool trying to<br />\ncatch the eye of a bored<br />\nsuburban housewife and then<br />\nsauntering over to the pro shop<br />\nand charging the green fees to<br />\nDad's tab, making sure the golf<br />\ncart is well-stocked with<br />\nsix-packs. Or there is the even<br />\nmore fallacious notion that<br />\ngolfers are in some way inferior,<br />\nsissified weaklings with a mental<br />\ndefect that allows them to<br />\ntolerate the inexorable dullness<br />\nof the game.<br />\nComdination<br />\n\"That's absolutely false,\"<br />\ncomments Hopkins golf coach<br />\nWin Smith. \"In golf, there is a<br />\ncertain interaction between man<br />\nand nature, and between man<br />\nand himself. Golf is also a game<br />\nthat requires great strength and<br />\ncoordination but even more<br />\nimportantly, coordination<br />\nbetween mind and body.\"<br />\n\"What attracted me to golf<br />\nwas the solitariness of the game,\"<br />\nreturning letterman Mike Deak<br />\nsays. \"Golf is the most honorable<br />\nsport I know. Golfers are so<br />\nmuch more civilized than those<br />\nuncouth Neo-neanderthals that<br />\nroam the lacrosse fields at will.\"<br />\nLast year the Hopkins golf<br />\nteam coasted to an 8-5 record, its<br />\nbest season in seven years. But<br />\nthis year's team, according to<br />\nSmith, a Hopkins graduate<br />\nhimself, has even greater<br />\npotential. \"We are looking to win<br />\nthe MAC championship an to<br />\ngain a berth in the NCAA<br />\nDivision III finals. I feel the<br />\ntalent to achieve these goals<br />\nexists among the team<br />\nmembers.\"<br />\nDespite an unorthodox stance<br />\nthat defies logical explanation,<br />\nsophomore Mike Deak has<br />\ncatapulted himself into the<br />\nnumber one position on the<br /><br />\nHpokins team. \"Mike\"s recent<br />\nhot streak proves his ability to<br />\nconsistently break 80,\" Coach<br />\nSmith said. \"That's a seven to<br />\neight stroke improvement over<br />\nlast year.\"<br />\nSenior Tom Vary, the top<br />\nreturning letterman, is the<br />\ncaptain of this year's squad.<br />\n\"Tom has constantly shown he<br />\ncan play top golf,\" Coach Smith<br />\nadded. \"He's the one person<br />\nwhose leadership everyone<br />\nrespects.\"<br />\nAll the way from Nebraska<br />\ncomes a real find in Coach<br />\nSmith's vast recruiting program.<br />\nfreshman Barclay Knapp,<br />\ncurrently the number three<br />\ngolfer.

Along with<br />\nDeak and Knapp, they will be the<br />\nfuture of the golf program here<br />\nat Hopkins,\" Coach Smith added.<br />\nIn two weeks the Hopkins golf<br />\nteam will journey south to play<br />\nin the GAC Tournament in Cape<br />\nCoral, Florida. Many of the<br />\nnation's finest college teams,<br />\nincluding the Univeristy of<br />\nFlorida, will be competing. \"The<br />\nFlorida trip provides us a good<br />\nchance to gain top-notch<br />\ncompetition and a head start on<br />\nthe long road to the MAC<br />\nchampionships.\"<br />\nLast Saturday in an exhibition<br />\nmatch, the Hopkins golf team<br />\ndefeated the University of<br />\nSoutheastern Massachusetts, 421<br />\nto 436. \"I'm very pleased that<br />\nour squad soundly beat a team<br />\nthat went to the NAIA<br />\nchampsionships last fall,\" Smith<br />\nboasted.
