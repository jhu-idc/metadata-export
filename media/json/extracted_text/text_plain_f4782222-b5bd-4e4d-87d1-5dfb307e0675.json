He<br />\nshowed that the ordinary fish-tail<br />\nburner is only One-fifth as efficient<br />\nas the Welsbach burner. The inverted mantle gives about the same<br />\ncandle power per cubic foot of gas<br />\nburned as the upright Welsbach ;<br />\nthe advantage of the inverted burner lies in its greater convenience<br />\nfrom the point of view of shading<br />\nthe light.<br />\nThere is a great difference<br />\nbetween the different forms of incandescent electric lights. The<br />\nordinary carbon filament lamp uses<br />\nfrom 3 to 37<br />\n2 watts of current<br />\nper Candle power. The lamp in<br />\nwhich -the.carbon filament has been<br />\ntreated by a special process uses<br />\n21<br />\n/<br />\n2 watts per candle power. The<br />\ntantalum lamp uses 2 watts and<br />\nth tungsten---\"Mazda\"\u2014lamp only<br />\n1;4 watts per candle power. The<br />\n' last-named lamp is thus three times<br />\nas efficient as the ordinary carbon<br />\nfilament lamp.<br />\nIn addition a number of lamps<br />\nused to light large buildings and<br />\nstreets were shown. The most<br />\ninteresting of these were the<br />\nmercury-vapor lamp and the flaming-arc. The mercury-vapor lamp,<br />\nbecause of its peculiar effect upon<br />\ncolors, is used only for industrial<br />\nlighting where color is of no consequence. The difference between<br />\nthe flaming arc and the ordinary arc<br />\nlamp is that the carbon poles of the<br />\nflaming arc are steeped in the solution of some salt which colors the<br />\nflame. It has been found that a<br />\n:pinkish-yellow light is most efficient.<br />\nThe effect of the various kinds<br />\nof light on color was interesting.<br />\n. Perhaps the most striking case was<br />\nthat of the mercury-vapor lamp.<br />\n,A red object introduced into the<br />\nlight of this lamp appeared a deep<br />\npurple, almost a black. This is due<br />\nto the fact that re41 rays are almost<br />\nentirely absent from this light.<br />\nAfter the close of the lecture<br />\nthe audience was invited to step<br />\nup to the platform and examine<br />\nthe experimental apparatus.

He<br />\nshowed that the ordinary fish-tail<br />\nburner is only One-fifth as efficient<br />\nas the Welsbach burner. The inverted mantle gives about the same<br />\ncandle power per cubic foot of gas<br />\nburned as the upright Welsbach ;<br />\nthe advantage of the inverted burner lies in its greater convenience<br />\nfrom the point of view of shading<br />\nthe light.<br />\nThere is a great difference<br />\nbetween the different forms of incandescent electric lights. The<br />\nordinary carbon filament lamp uses<br />\nfrom 3 to 37<br />\n2 watts of current<br />\nper Candle power. The lamp in<br />\nwhich -the.carbon filament has been<br />\ntreated by a special process uses<br />\n21<br />\n/<br />\n2 watts per candle power. The<br />\ntantalum lamp uses 2 watts and<br />\nth tungsten---\"Mazda\"\u2014lamp only<br />\n1;4 watts per candle power. The<br />\n' last-named lamp is thus three times<br />\nas efficient as the ordinary carbon<br />\nfilament lamp.<br />\nIn addition a number of lamps<br />\nused to light large buildings and<br />\nstreets were shown. The most<br />\ninteresting of these were the<br />\nmercury-vapor lamp and the flaming-arc. The mercury-vapor lamp,<br />\nbecause of its peculiar effect upon<br />\ncolors, is used only for industrial<br />\nlighting where color is of no consequence. The difference between<br />\nthe flaming arc and the ordinary arc<br />\nlamp is that the carbon poles of the<br />\nflaming arc are steeped in the solution of some salt which colors the<br />\nflame. It has been found that a<br />\n:pinkish-yellow light is most efficient.<br />\nThe effect of the various kinds<br />\nof light on color was interesting.<br />\n. Perhaps the most striking case was<br />\nthat of the mercury-vapor lamp.<br />\n,A red object introduced into the<br />\nlight of this lamp appeared a deep<br />\npurple, almost a black. This is due<br />\nto the fact that re41 rays are almost<br />\nentirely absent from this light.<br />\nAfter the close of the lecture<br />\nthe audience was invited to step<br />\nup to the platform and examine<br />\nthe experimental apparatus.
