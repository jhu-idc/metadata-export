Lana, who has<br />\ngiven periodic updates to the<br />\ncouncil on the progress of the<br />\ncuts in Congress, explained that<br />\nthe proposed budget is currently out of committee in the<br />\nSenate and is likely to be<br />\nreworked on the senate floor.

The SAC budget for<br />\nnext year is effectively for the<br />\nsame amount as this year, approximately $121,000, or about<br />\n$50 per student.\"<br />\nPan noted that, \"SAC<br />\nbudget increases certainly don't<br />\nkeep pace with tuition increases.\" The Council briefly<br />\nconsidered separating the<br />\nsource of activities funding<br />\nfrom university tuition by<br />\ncharging a student activities fee.<br />\n*Spring Fair co-Chairmen<br />\nBryce Quayle and Mike<br />\nVogelbaum reported that with<br />\ntwo weeks remaining before the<br />\nfair, preparations are proceeding on schedule. \"Now's<br />\nwhen all the fun starts. . .,\"<br />\nsaid Vogelbaum. \"See you at<br />\n<br />\nthe fair!\"<br />\n*Public Interest Investment<br />\nAdvisory Committee representative Brad Marks reported on<br />\nthe committee's recent activities.

Because<br />\nof the turnout, the forum only lasted an hour.<br />\nMost speeches consisted of<br />\nan introduction of past experience, followed by an affirmation of enthusiasm, concluded by asking if there were any<br />\nquestions. No questions were<br />\nraised during the forum.<br />\nSpeeches were given in order<br />\nof class, then office.

There are, of course,<br />\nmetaphysical explanations<br />\nwhich involve God and a soul.<br />\nAccording to Coffey,<br />\nthough, the reason for human<br />\ncreativity really does not mat<br />\nter in the end. The fact is that<br />\nhumans possess a unique<br />\ncreative ability. According to<br />\nCoffey, the products of this<br />\ncreativity are evident in nearly<br />\nall human activity. Man's ability to alter nature is just as<br />\n\"natural\" as his own genetic<br />\ncode. Things that man builds,<br />\naccording to Coffey, can be<br />\nseen, ultimately, as the products of evolution.<br />\nIn the end, Coffey never attempted to predict mankind's<br />\nfuture. He simply examined the<br />\nproducts of technology, to view<br />\nmankind from a better perspective. He then surveyed man's<br />\nincreasing ability to change his<br />\nworld.

Douglas Jones, M.D.,<br />\nClinical Director of the<br />\nNeonatal Intensive Care Unit<br />\n(NICU) at Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, recently spoke at a<br />\nSchool of Continuing Studies<br />\nlecture about the development<br />\nof NICU in treatment of<br />\npremature infants.<br />\nNeonatal Intensive Care has<br />\nimproved dramatically within<br />\nthe last fifteen years. This is the<br />\nresult of inventions and vast<br />\nimprovements in technology<br />\nthat have simplified the care of<br />\npremature infants. Even<br />\nthough more than 80% of all<br />\npremature infants survive today, doctors are learning more<br />\nand more every day that \"life<br />\nin the uterus is no simpler than<br />\nlife outside.\"<br />\nA dramatic change in the<br />\nlikelihood that a baby born<br />\nprematurely would survive ozcurred in the mid-1970s. Before<br />\nthe 70's it was rare for a baby<br />\nborn under 3 lbs. to survive. A<br />\nstudy done at the University of<br />\nColorado showed that in<br />\n1958-1968 the mortality rate<br />\nwas 60.4% for babies weighing<br />\nless than 1500 grams (approximately 3 lbs.). This decreased<br />\nto 53.8% during the period<br />\n1970-1974 and dropped even<br />\nmore in 1975-1977 to 31%. Today a baby that weighs about<br />\n1100 grams, which is usually 11<br />\nweeks early, has a greater than<br />\n80% survival rate.<br />\n<br />\nWhy did this mortality rate<br />\nchange so suddenly during the<br />\nmid-1970s? Dr. Jones attributes<br />\nthis change to four major<br />\nreasons: technological advances, a change in attitude, experience, and resources. This<br />\ndramatic increase in survival<br />\ndoesn't mean that all babies<br />\naren't sick if they survive, but<br />\nmost develop normally.<br />\nIf you walk into an NICU today you will see babies attached to monitoring equipment<br />\nand many wires. Christopher<br />\nScott, who is about five years<br />\nold today, was a typical<br />\npremature baby. Electrodes<br />\nthat monitor heart rate and<br />\nrespiration were placed on his<br />\nchest, arms, and legs. He also<br />\nhad an intraarterial infusion<br />\ncatheter placed into one of the<br />\numbilical vessels that leads to a<br />\nmajor artery that serves the<br />\nlower body. Blood can be<br />\nwithdrawn from this catheter to<br />\nmonitor oxygen content<br />\nbecause many babies have problems with lung function. This<br />\nmeans that they have trouble<br />\ngetting oxygen into their blood,<br />\nChristopher also had a feeding<br />\ntube that went directly into his<br />\nstomach and an endotracheal<br />\ntube that was put into the windpipe to help with breathing. He<br />\nhad \"bad\" lung disease which<br />\nis severe in anyone but particularly harmful in a tiny baby.<br />\nThe repirator used on these<br />\nchildren is regulated so the<br />\nbabies do the vast majority of<br />\ntheir breathing on their own.<br />\nThese babies, therefore, require<br />\na lot of support to survive.<br />\n<br />\nMost children even do well<br />\nThe Maryland Science<br />\nwhen they have alarming<br />\nmedical problems.

The<br />\nassumption was made that if<br />\nbabies with lung disease looked better, maybe every baby<br />\nwould look healthier if given<br />\noxygen and so for a number of<br />\nyears it became common to give<br />\nlarge quantities of oxygen to<br />\npremature babies for long<br />\nperiods of time. The developing<br />\neye, which is sensitive to oxygen, was damaged and blindness usually resulted. Eye<br />\ndamage reached what was said<br />\nto be epidemic proportions.<br />\nDr. Arnold Patz, head of the<br />\nWilmer Eye Institute, was the<br />\nfirst to say that the increased<br />\nuse of oxygen was the cause of<br />\nblindness. The reaction, when<br />\nthe association between oxygen<br />\nand blindness was made, was to<br />\ncut the oxygen supply down to<br />\nlow levels. A large number of<br />\npremature babies that needed<br />\noxygen to survive either didn't<br />\nsurvive this or were severely<br />\ndamaged. At first there was a<br />\ngross overusav of oxygen,<br />\nalbeit with good intentions, in<br />\nthe 40's and 50's, it was then<br />\nfollowed by a rather strange<br />\nand unreasonable restriction of<br />\noxygen use. This began in the<br />\nmid-1950s and extended until it<br />\nbecame possible to measure the<br />\narterial concentration of oxygen. This is the actual partial<br />\npressure of oxygen in the lungs.<br />\nThis important technological<br />\nadvance was critical to modern<br />\nNIC.<br />\nfrom the nineIt was known<br />\nteenth century that heat could<br />\nhelp nurture the premature infant. One of the original incubators had an oil flame that<br />\nwould heat a reservoir of water<br />\nat the bottom. Air would circulate around the warm water<br />\nreservoir and rise up around the<br />\nbaby to keep it warm.<br />\nIn the late nineteenth century, a French obstetrician<br />\n<br />\nJess Bunshaft<br />\nM. Douglas Jones, M.D., lecturing about neonatal intensive care<br />\n<br />\nnamed Boudan systematically<br />\nlooked at the effect of warmth<br />\non the survival of premature infants. His incubator was first<br />\ntried out at the Paris zoo with<br />\nchimpanzees.<br />\nMartin Kooney, one of<br />\nBoudan's followers, was SO<br />\nenamored with premature<br />\nbabies and how well they did in<br />\nthese incubators that he decided to publicize his findings.<br />\nPartially as a way of raising<br />\nmoney and also because of its<br />\nstunt aspects, he went to the<br />\nBerlin Exposition in the 1890s.<br />\nHis circus sideshow, called a<br />\n\"child hatchery,\" consisted of<br />\nmany premature babies in incubators set up so the public<br />\ncould come in and observe<br />\nthem. At the Pan-American<br />\nExposition in Buffalo, he built<br />\na big building called \"Infant Incubators.\" Inside he placed incubators along the walls with<br />\nnurses watching over each<br />\nbaby. Kooney found this so<br />\nsuccessful that he actually moved his show to Coney Island.<br />\nHis incubator side show stayed<br />\nthere until the N.Y. World's<br />\nFair of 1939.<br />\nThese babies were unlikely to<br />\nsurvive otherwise so the public<br />\nnever questioned Kooney's actions. Doctors thought that it<br />\n<br />\nwas important to keep the<br />\nbabies isolated so the incubators were covered with<br />\nglass. Unfortunately they<br />\nthought at the time that it was<br />\nequally important to keep<br />\nbabies separated from their<br />\nparents. This is a practice that<br />\nonly ended about 10 or 15 years<br />\nago. Today parents are encouraged to spend a lot of time<br />\nwith their babies.<br />\nThe concepts about warmth,<br />\nexpressed carefully in Boudan's<br />\nbook \"The Nurseling,\" were<br />\nforgotten until the late 1950s<br />\nand early 60's. It wasn't<br />\nremembered how exquisitely<br />\nsensitive these tiny babies were<br />\nto rather small changes in environmental temperature. Data<br />\ncompiled in 1964 show the great<br />\nincrease in survival rate for a<br />\nsmall gradient in temperature.<br />\nBabies kept at 34.5 degrees<br />\nCelsius have a 51% survival<br />\nrate, while babies kept at 36<br />\ndegrees have a survival rate of<br />\n8201o. It thus became apparent<br />\nthat the simplx measure of<br />\nkeeping babies warm was extraordinarily important in<br />\ndetermining how likely they<br />\nwere to survive.<br />\nNext week: Today's NIC.<br />\n<br />\nCUNARD 1985<br />\n<br />\nEIROPEONSALIV<br />\n<br />\nYou've seen the poster,<br />\nYou've seen the banner,<br />\nYou read the article,<br />\nYou got the flyer in your mailbox,<br />\nAnd now you're reading this.<br />\n<br />\nSO GIVE US A BREAK!<br />\n<br />\nREGISTER NOW<br />\nthe<br />\nat<br />\n<br />\nUnion Desk<br />\n<br />\nAND ICRANDAM INCLUDES ALL THESE EXTRAS:<br />\n<br />\n.

It's an<br />\nunusually warm day for March;<br />\nNorthern<br />\nCalifornia is<br />\nnotorious for its chilly weather<br />\nand frequent showers which<br />\ndrive even the most devout<br />\nbongo players into cappucino<br />\ncafes for cover. But today they<br />\nare out on Telegraph Avenue,<br />\nBerkeley's main strip, pounding<br />\naway. Berkeley residents in tiedyed teeshirts sway arhythmically, yet enthusiastically, to the<br />\ndrums.<br />\nThere is a ragged man waving his hands and shouting<br />\nabout Salvation and Filthy<br />\nLust. No one notices him as<br />\nthey stroll by to the hairdresser,<br />\npizza parlour, or class; he is<br />\nmerely one of an army of street<br />\ncrazies. This is the Berkeley I<br />\nexpected; street vendors selling<br />\nfelafel and earrings, adorable<br />\nblonds on mopeds, croissant<br />\nshops and Egyptian fast food<br />\non every corner.<br />\nThe hectic step of the East<br />\nCoast has vanished; instead,<br />\nyou have a languid trail of convertibles snaking up Hearst<br />\nAvenue, stopping for any<br />\npedestrian, real or imagined.<br />\nOn my first day in the Bay<br />\nArea, I waited for the cars to<br />\npass; however, I discovered my<br />\nlawfulness was causing a traffic jam among the Hondas ignoring their green light. I wised up fast.<br />\nThe other strange thing you<br />\nnotice about the street is the<br />\nlack of hassling. No wolf<br />\nwhistles, no lust-crazed declarations, no profanity. Walking by<br />\na group of construction<br />\nworkers leaning against their<br />\nequipment, I was subjected to<br />\na polite, \"Good morning, how<br />\nare you doing?\" \"Fine,\" I<br />\nreplied, taking off my<br />\nsunglasses. Evidently they had<br />\nbeen trained by Bay Area<br />\nfeminists. Now I felt guilty<br />\nlooking at their biceps.<br />\nThere are bodies everywhere.<br />\nTaut torsos, and long, lean<br />\ngolden legs honed by years of<br />\njogging. Every morning I<br />\nawake to the gentle slapping of<br />\nfeet against pavement. Running<br />\n<br />\nhas become a cliched part of<br />\nlife; no one gets credit for doing it any more. Trendy boutiques sell teeshirts proclaiming,<br />\n\"Did Not Run in Bay for<br />\nBreakers,\" referring to a<br />\npopular marathon across the<br />\nGolden Gate Bridge.<br />\nTrue to form, running is<br />\nabout the only activity outside<br />\nof walking allowed on UC<br />\nBerkeley's 178 acres. No<br />\nmoped-ing, skate-boarding,<br />\nand certainly no roller-skating;<br />\nindeed, one JHU student who<br />\nshall remain nameless was bodily removed from campus by<br />\ntwo hefty security guards for<br />\nthis offense. You can tell those<br />\nEast Coast kids right away.<br />\nCampus security at Berkeley<br />\nis an awesome force for an area<br />\nwhich suffers little crime. The<br />\nofficers carry guns and recently roughed up several students<br />\nprotesting apartheid. In March,<br />\n1000 students protested University investments in South Africa<br />\nand several spent more than<br />\none night in jail.<br />\nThe birth of the campus antiapartheid movement last fall<br />\nwas an interesting one. The San<br />\nFrancisco Chronicle had<br />\nreported activism was dead at<br />\nBerkeley; after all, many<br />\nstudents were engineers or<br />\nvoted for Reagan, which is<br />\nclose enough in some eyes. The<br />\nstudents didn't like this. It shattered their vision of a progressive, active, \"happenning\"<br />\ncampus. After all, weren't they<br />\nonce the core of national<br />\nunrest?<br />\nFour days after the notorious<br />\narticle, a student group began<br />\nworking on South African<br />\nawareness. Now, the campus'<br />\nDaily Californian devotes practically an article a day to the<br />\nburgeoning movement.<br />\nGenerally, the campus paper<br />\ncovers much harder news topics<br />\nthan the Chronicle.

The Chronicle is laid<br />\nout like a tabloid and covers<br />\nstories like \"How to Marry<br />\nMoney,\" \"Pets of the Rich,\"<br />\nand \"Lately We've Been Talking About Having Sex.\" There<br />\nis Gerald Nachman's daily column titled \"The Single Life,\"<br />\nin which he laments his relationships: women want corn-<br />\n<br />\nmitment, women live too tar<br />\naway to drive to, on and on,ad<br />\nnauseum.<br />\n<br />\nBut \"The Single Life\" pales<br />\nin comparison with the movie<br />\nand society columns, which<br />\nrecently devoted a lot of space<br />\nto the San Francisco premiere<br />\nof an X-rated flick called \"The<br />\nGrafenburg Spot.\" Besides<br />\ndiscussing the film's merits and<br />\nits audience, the reviewer let us<br />\nin on his personal feelings<br />\nabout G-spots as well.<br />\nAll this talk of love and<br />\nwhat-not made me curious<br />\nabout the real status of relationships in San Francisco. I<br />\nwandered down to HaightAshbury, that old mecca of free<br />\nlove and drugs, one Friday<br />\nnight. I found neither, and<br />\nthere were just a handful of<br />\nhippies and derelicts. There<br />\nwere plenty of sweet young<br />\nthings with mohawked heads<br />\nswinging into the I-Beam in<br />\ntheir plastic jeans.<br />\nThe I-Beam and Chi-Chi<br />\nClubspecialize in hot new bands<br />\nsuch as The Stupeds and The<br />\nFreaky Executives. There is a<br />\ncover charge for admission into the ranks of the hip, so we<br />\n(two East Coast girls, two<br />\nbrutally beautiful Berkeley<br />\nboys) slouched into another<br />\nclub called the Anxious Asp,<br />\nwhich a long-haired patron<br />\nassured us was \"hell of<br />\nawesome!\" as he ran down the<br />\nstreet.<br />\nThe Anxious Asp was a dark,<br />\nsmoky little bar with tiny tables<br />\nand an intimate dance floor. A<br />\nsullen-looking waitress served<br />\nus stiff vodka tonics with her<br />\nfingerless lace gloves. A relaxed crowd of blacks and whites<br />\nmixed freely on the dance floor<br />\nas RUN DMC and Jesse Johnson<br />\nblared from a tiny DJ booth<br />\nmanned by a Michael Jackson<br />\nlook-alike.<br />\nThe bar's patrons, who<br />\nleaned against red leather banquettes and watched the dancing hungrily, were positive<br />\nabout the city and the the Anxious Asp's role in their lives.<br />\nFrenchie, a morose-looking sax<br />\nplayer with a black beret and<br />\nbeard told me he had been a<br />\nregular for years, as well as at<br />\nanother bar called \"The Ancient Asp.\"<br />\n\"I'm a beatnik,\" he repeated<br />\nover and over again as he stared<br />\n<br />\n401VERSITY OF CAL1FORN<br />\n<br />\n11111111114<br />\n<br />\nKai ow<br />\nt'<br />\n<br />\nNt.\u2022<br />\n<br />\nA postcard glimpse of Sather Gate, University of California.<br />\n<br />\ninto his drink and told me nt<br />\nwas fifty years old.<br />\n\"Are you blind, lady?\" he<br />\nasked abruptly midway through<br />\nour interview,<br />\n\"Excuse me?\" I said.<br />\nPerhaps I had missed some profundity in his ramblings. ..<br />\n\"You look blind, lady.

Garret<br />\nRobinson, a 22-year-old wearing black leather and an engaging grin, had nothing but praise<br />\nfor the California life.<br />\n\"I love the Asp 'cause<br />\neveryone's full of fun! It's really great to meet young ladies<br />\nlike you. I's the one who makes<br />\nthe place jump! They pays me,<br />\nI'm their number one dancer.\"<br />\nGarret believes Californians,<br />\nincluding him, have a different<br />\nmentality. \"My confidence in<br />\nmyself is what counts; the way<br />\nI take care of my financial<br />\ndevelopments.\" He rates his<br />\nsocial life \"A plus.\"<br />\nThis overwhelming nirvana<br />\nflows through every strata of<br />\nthe Bay Area. Across the bridge<br />\nin Berkeley, UC students are<br />\nblatantly arrogant about their<br />\ncity's superiority to anything on<br />\nthe East Coast or the rest of the<br />\nworld.<br />\n\"Partying is the most impor\u2022 tant thing,\" Scott Hill states.<br />\n<br />\nThe massive blond rugby player<br />\nhas put on a navy blazer and<br />\nmadras tie just to enjoy a beer<br />\nin the most fashionable campus<br />\nnight spot, Henry's. Walking<br />\ninto Henry's is like walking into a wood-panelled, Persiancarpeted library overrun by<br />\nlissome blond lads and lasses<br />\ndressed as formally as Scott, or<br />\nin rugby shirts and pressed<br />\njeans.

Michael hails from<br />\nwealthy Mann County and says<br />\nhe was pleased to find Berkeley<br />\nwasn't the stereotyped hippie<br />\nradical haven of the past.<br />\n\"I've been even more conservative since I've been going to<br />\nschool,\" he confides. \"I voted<br />\nfor Reagan.

This musical<br />\ntalent show is without precedent in Hopkins' recent history,<br />\nand promises to be an exciting<br />\nand enjoyable evening for both<br />\nthe participants and the<br />\naudience.<br />\nThe event is mainly sponsored by the Office of Residential Life, with publicity cosponsorship by the HOP.<br />\nTracey Lyons, the activities<br />\ncoordinator for the O.R.L.,<br />\ndistributed a questionnaire last<br />\nfall to all freshmen, and interest<br />\nwas expressed in a talent show<br />\nproduction. In response, Paul<br />\nBrunetta, a senior and Community Assistant in Building B,<br />\norganized a committee for<br />\n\"Musical Showcase\" and acquired funding for this large<br />\nevent.<br />\nInformal rehearsals were<br />\nheld in early March, and approximately fourteen acts are<br />\nscheduled to perform on the<br />\n11th. Four categories are included: Rock, Pop, Classical,<br />\nand Musical Comedy. In addition, three judges (a faculty<br />\nmember, an administrator, and<br />\na student) were chosen by the<br />\ncommittee for the evening.<br />\n<br />\nThese judges will choose the<br />\nbest act from each category,<br />\nand the performers' names will<br />\nbe engraved on a plaque<br />\nordered for the occasion. Tshirts and flowers will be provided for all performers,<br />\njudges, and committee<br />\nmembers.<br />\nThose organizing \"Musical<br />\nShowcase '85: Hopkins' Best\"<br />\nare hoping to fill a large gap in<br />\nthis university's entertainment<br />\ncalendar by providing members<br />\nof our own student body with<br />\na chance to show off their<br />\nmusical talents, and their<br />\nclassmates with a chance to applaud them. All four<br />\nundergraduate classes are<br />\nrepresented, and the range and<br />\nquality of talent on campus is<br />\nvery impressive, although<br />\nmainly unexpressed. It's hoped<br />\nthat a tradition will be startbd<br />\nthis year that in subsequent<br />\nyears will become an annual<br />\npre-Spring Fair event.<br />\n\"Musical<br />\nShowcase\"<br />\nfeatures an a capella group, 3<br />\nvarious classical and pop<br />\npieces, some original material,<br />\na musical comedy routine, and<br />\ntwo rock bands.

As the others sauce, and fried to perfection,<br />\nwere regulars, the waiter knew the toast was an old friend<br />\nto fetch a pot of tea, and as we given a new and wondrous<br />\nsipped, my initiation into the luster. When dipped in the<br />\nrituals of Dim Sum began.

Of course, not<br />\nbeing a standout in such company is no slight on a dish.<br />\nNow the rest of the meal arrived: numerous steamer bowls<br />\ncontaining dumplings and<br />\nsteamed buns. As these were<br />\ndistributed about the already<br />\ncrowded table by the waiter, I<br />\nsampled the camphor and tea<br />\nsmoked duck. This was not<br />\nmere<br />\nfood,<br />\nnot<br />\njust<br />\nambrosia\u2014this was joy, this<br />\nwas sex, this was. .God. A<br />\ngentle blending of the smokes<br />\nwith the delicate flavor of the<br />\nduck made for an inscrutable<br />\nand subtle, thoroughly captivating dish. The meat was<br />\ncooked to tender, moist perfection; the skin was crisp, giving<br />\ntantalizing hints of the wonders<br />\nit contained. This was the most<br />\nexquisite food served at the<br />\nmeal, and being introduced to<br />\nthis was in itself worth the price<br />\nof the meal.<br />\nBefore making my assault on<br />\nthe steamers, I partook of the<br />\nDan Dan noodles. These were<br />\nconventional egg noodles in a<br />\nlight, slightly smoky sauce, with<br />\nhints of soy and sherry in it.<br />\nTasty. Having dipped into all<br />\n<br />\nof the first course, I moved on<br />\nto the steamed buns and<br />\ndumplings.<br />\nFirst were the buns, large and<br />\nsmall. The large was a thick<br />\npastry shell filled with a fairly<br />\nstandard blend of shredded<br />\npork and vegetables; the pastry<br />\nwas soft and sweet, the filling<br />\nhot and varied\u2014as a whole,<br />\nvery satisfying. The small buns<br />\nwere made of somewhat thinner<br />\nshells of the same pastry and<br />\nfilled with a very solidly meaty<br />\npork ball. With the house sauce<br />\ndescribed earlier these were<br />\nespecially satisfying. Wontons<br />\nin spicy sauce were there too,<br />\nfiery on the outsIde, cool on the<br />\ninside; delicate and pleasing.<br />\nPork shiu-mai, also a soft<br />\npastry cup filled with pork and<br />\ntopped with a single green pea<br />\nwas no stranger to me; Cheng's<br />\nwere prepared admirably.<br />\nLastly, the special hit of the<br />\nsteamed section of the<br />\nadventure\u2014shrimp dumplings.<br />\nWithin an extremely delicate,<br />\n<br />\ntranslucent dough wrapping of<br />\nsubtle and seductive flavor,<br />\nthere was a filling of shrimp<br />\nthat, rather than overpowering<br />\nthe taste of the wrapper, combined with it to produce a totally unique flavor.<br />\nThe orgiastically joyful<br />\neating went on until all that remained was a single sesame<br />\nball, and a vast field of empty<br />\nplates, steamers, and cleanly<br />\npicked bones. Marcus took the<br />\nball and eventually ate it on the<br />\nwalk back to Bob's place. The<br />\nbill for enough food to fill the<br />\nfive of us was, including tips,<br />\n$65.

The Purple Rose of<br />\nCairo is not entirely in color,<br />\nthough; there are some black<br />\nand white sequences and, as<br />\nridiculous a statement as this<br />\nmay first seem, Allen's use of<br />\ncolor in Purple Rose actually<br />\nseems to reinforce, not depart<br />\nfrom, his use of black and<br />\nwhite in the past. Confused?<br />\nThere is another famous film<br />\nwith sequences both in color<br />\nand black and white: The<br />\nWizard of Oz. But the use of<br />\nblack and white and the use of<br />\ncolor work in an entirely opposite fashion in The Wizard of<br />\nOz as they do in The Purple<br />\nRose of Cairo. In The Wizard<br />\nof Oz, the black and white sequences were used to show the<br />\nboring and mundane qualities<br />\n<br />\nby Steve Brett<br />\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo<br />\nseems to mark more than one<br />\ndeparture from what has<br />\nbecome the norm for filmmaker Woody Allen. First of<br />\nall, he is conspicuous in his<br />\nabsence from the screen. This<br />\nis not the first time Mr. Allen<br />\nhas restricted his involvement<br />\nto the other side of the camera,<br />\nbut his earlir effort (1978's Interiors) was a drama, and Mr.<br />\nAllen is known solely as a comedic actor. Mr. Allen himself<br />\nhas indicated, though, that he<br />\ndid not feel it was necessary to<br />\nsacrifice making the comedy<br />\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo simply because the idea of the film<br />\ndid not include a part for him<br />\nto play.<br />\nAnother difference from<br />\nusual Woody Allen work, and<br />\nperhaps more striking from an<br />\nartistic point of view, is Mr.<br />\n<br />\nof Dorothy's Kansas, as compared to the exciting color fantasyland of Oz. In Purple Rose,<br />\nhowever, black and white is the<br />\nfantasy world and color is the<br />\nmundane real life. The Purple<br />\nRose of Cairo takes place during the depression, and Mr.<br />\nAllen's use of black and white<br />\nversus color accurately<br />\nrepresents what life was like in<br />\nthe United States at the time:<br />\none could not help but see the<br />\ndepressed real world in color,<br />\nperhaps the only escape being<br />\nthe black and white fantasy<br />\nworld of the movies. The black<br />\nand white scenes of The Purple<br />\nRose of Cairo all take place in<br />\na movie-within-the-movie.<br />\nBasically, in The Purple Rose<br />\nof Cairo, Mr. Allen has shown<br />\n\"black and white\" to be the<br />\nthing that separates movies<br />\nfrom reality. How much of a<br />\ndeparture is this statement for<br />\na man who has elected to make<br />\n<br />\nHusker Dil: New Day Rising<br />\nby Peter Oehlkers<br />\nHusker Du, New Day Rising,<br />\nSST Records.<br />\nI gotta make plans for the<br />\nplans I make<br />\nGotta have friends for the<br />\nfriends I make<br />\nI gotta make plans for the<br />\nfriends I make<br />\nGotta have friends for the<br />\nplans I make<br />\n\u2014\"Plans I Make\"<br />\nAt the beginning of last summer, Husker Du released an<br />\nalbum that is already semilegendary\u2014Zen Arcade\u2014a two<br />\nrecord set that shattered conceptions of what hard<br />\ncore/punk was capable of. It<br />\nwas at various times acoustic,<br />\nHeavy Metalish, poppish, and<br />\npsychedelic, but it was.<br />\n<br />\nthoroughly punk in execution<br />\nand philosophy. And like any<br />\ntrue punk album (or rock & roll<br />\nalbum for that matter) it was<br />\nspontaneous and uncontrived<br />\n\u2014recorded and mixed in the<br />\nunheard of time of 85 hours.<br />\nAnd like any true punk album,<br />\nas a result of spontaneity, it had<br />\nits share of misses; it wasn't perfect, occasionally long and<br />\noccasionally self-indulgent.<br />\nThus the release of New Day<br />\nRising was eagerly awaited.<br />\nAfter having honed their skills<br />\na bit more (but not too much<br />\nmind you) would Husker Du<br />\nmake an album that was truly<br />\ngreat? Well. . . not yet. New<br />\nDay Rising is a step in the right<br />\ndirection for the band, but it<br />\nhas some rather major<br />\nproblems.<br />\nIt's hard to believe that this<br />\nis the same Husker Du that was<br />\n<br />\nUST FILM<br />\nOF I E YEAR<br />\nUST DIRECTOR<br />\nOF IRE YEAR<br />\n<br />\nA SlaNty Olubmk P,Cluk\u2022 .,\u2022\u2022 A<br />\n<br />\nA 1,1414(HANGt<br />\n<br />\nCor\u2022 and VI.11P1 Kr. \u2022<br />\n<br />\n'A Clockwork Orange Is one of the<br />\nfew perfect movies I have seen In my<br />\nNewt N AS,day News<br />\nlifetime.<br />\n<br />\nBEST PICTURE<br />\nBEST DIRECTOR<br />\n<br />\nWINNER N Y FILM CRITICS AwARUS<br />\n<br />\nsuch a run-of-the-mill hardcore<br />\nband just a few years ago.<br />\nThankfully their development<br />\nout of hardcore has led them in<br />\na more thoughtful direction<br />\nthan bands like Black Flag and<br />\nSSD which are now blatantly<br />\nHeavy Metal. While those<br />\nbands seem stuck in a state of<br />\nperpetual adolescence, Husker<br />\nDu has made a conscious decision to grow up. At the risk of<br />\nsounding contradictory, I<br />\nwould say New Day Rising is<br />\nthe first \"adult\" punk album.<br />\nIt is an album about change<br />\n\u2014new beginnings and the loss<br />\nof the old.

Cecilia, played by<br />\nMia Farrow, spends so much<br />\ntime at the Jewel escaping dayto-day reality that she is on a<br />\nfirst-name basis with all of the<br />\ntheater's employees. Her oppressive, out-of-work, violent<br />\nhusband (Danny Aiello), who<br />\ngambles away the money just as<br />\nfast as she makes it by waitressing, is just one of these realities<br />\nfrom which she needs an<br />\nescape. Another one comes in<br />\nthe form of her own unemployment. Fired because of her own<br />\nineptitude, her only means of<br />\nescape is the latest offering at<br />\nthe Jewel, which she has seen a<br />\nnumber of times already. In<br />\nfact, someone at the theater<br />\ncomments upon Cecilia's having been back to see Purple<br />\nRose so many times: \"You<br />\nmust really love this movie,\" he<br />\ntells her. The only thing extraordinary about this is that<br />\nthe person who makes the comment is on the screen.<br />\nThe commenter is Tom Ba2i-<br />\n<br />\nPress Photo<br />\n<br />\nter of the Chicago Baxters<br />\n(played by Jeff Daniels, who<br />\nalso played Debra Winger's<br />\nhusband in Terms of Endearment), an adventurer who has<br />\ntravelled to Egypt in search of<br />\nthe legendary Purple Rose.<br />\nAfter a brief discussion with<br />\nCecilia, Baxter walks off the,<br />\nscreen to greet and romance his<br />\nbiggest fan, much to the<br />\nchagrin of his fellow characters.<br />\nIt seems that actor Gil<br />\nShepherd (also Jeff Daniels)<br />\nhad done such a fine job of<br />\nbringing the character of Tom<br />\nBaxter to life that Baxter was<br />\nactually able to walk off of the<br />\nscreen in New Jersey, and his<br />\ncharacter has made similar attempts to do so in movie<br />\ntheaters across the country.<br />\nIn Mr. Allen's world behind<br />\nthe screen, the characters really exist and go through the motions of their story each time<br />\nthe projector is switched on.<br />\nWhen it is switched off,<br />\nhowever, the characters seem to<br />\nenter an uncomfortable state of<br />\nlimbo.

The band<br />\nseems world-weary before its<br />\ntime. When drummer Grant<br />\nHart sings about \"The Girl<br />\nWho Lives on Heaven Hill,\"<br />\nalthough he seems to be in love<br />\nwith her, he winds up screaming. At the end of \"Plans I<br />\nMake,\" guitarist Bob Mould,<br />\nseems genuinely sick and tired<br />\nof it all. Yet there is still<br />\nunderneath it all the essential<br />\npunk stubborness\u2014the unwillingness to admit defeat. There<br />\nis a good reason why this album<br />\nis entitled New Day Rising.<br />\nThere is also a good reason why<br />\nBob Mould is reduced to<br />\nscreaming those three words<br />\nover and over during the title<br />\ntrack.<br />\nMusically, Husker Du<br />\ndoesn't vary as much as they<br />\ndid on Zen Arcade. All the<br />\nsongs are built on the same<br />\nmodel\u2014Mould lays down a<br />\nbuzzing guitar drone (nearly<br />\nelectronic static, really) and<br />\nthey go from there\u2014sometimes<br />\nfast and loud (though never to<br />\nhardcore standards), sometimes<br />\nquite tuneful. Remarkably<br />\nenough, the result is a quite<br />\nfolky sound. In fact Grant<br />\nHart's \"Terms of Psychic Warfare\" sounds a lot like a Bob<br />\nDylan piece. That these guys<br />\nhave been affected by their lives<br />\nin the Midwest (Minnesota) is<br />\ntrue without a doubt.<br />\n41111. .111110 411N1b 4101.<br />\n<br />\nBut the problems...This<br />\nalbum is hampered by truly bad<br />\nproduction. \"Spot,\" who produces most of the stuff at SST<br />\nis usually pretty competent. Not<br />\nhere. Mould's guitar sometimes<br />\nbuzzes so loudly that you can't<br />\nhear anything else. Most of the<br />\nvocals are mixed so far down<br />\nthey're reduced to mumblings,<br />\nalthough at least once this is intentional. Luckily they've included a lyric sheet so things are<br />\nmuch less frustrating than they<br />\nmight have been. In fact, this<br />\nproblem is not insurmountable;<br />\nthe more you listen to the<br />\nrecord, the more you get used<br />\nto the production, however, a<br />\nfirst listen might be enough to<br />\nturn someone off altogether.<br />\nThe other problem makes me<br />\nthink that this album was rushed along a little too quickly. It<br />\nseems like some of the songs<br />\nweren't completely worked out<br />\n(e.g. the chorus in \"Folklore\")<br />\nand other songs are just filler<br />\n(\"How to Skin a Cat,\" \"Whatcha Drinkin'?\"). While most of<br />\nthe songs are strong enough to<br />\nwithstand the production, these<br />\nsongs disappear in their<br />\nmurkiness.<br />\nThus, New Day Rising is not<br />\nthe album everyone's been<br />\nwaiting for, but it too, like Zen<br />\nArcade, shows a great deal of<br />\npromise for Husker Du. When<br />\neverything does come together,<br />\nas on \"The Girl Who Lives on<br />\nHeaven Hill,\" it's breathtaking. Now I am pretty sick of<br />\nall that \"America's Back\"<br />\nsloganeering, but as far as rock<br />\nmusic is concerned, with bands<br />\nlike Husker Du we can take all<br />\ncomers.<br />\n.imer<br />\n<br />\n4111.<br />\n<br />\n4101. .1111. dan.<br />\n<br />\nFREE TEE SHIRT OFFER!!<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nDORMS \u2022 ORGANIZATIONS<br />\nI \u2022 TEAMS \u2022 SCHOOL GROUPS \u2022<br />\nfor JOHNS HOPKINS ONLY<br />\nGROUP DISCOUNTS<br />\nFREE PICK-UP & DELIVERY<br />\n<br />\nT-Shirts<br />\nJackets<br />\n<br />\nSweatshirts<br />\nSportswear<br />\n<br />\nCall anytime for details!<br />\nRoyal Tees T-Shirt Centers<br />\n&<br />\n764-6474<br />\n682-4076<br />\nGrossman<br />\nI Ask for Seth<br />\n<br />\nServing Hopkins for 6 years<br />\n<br />\n.14.111. 411\u202210. .1111111. 411110.<br />\n<br />\n411MIN.<br />\n<br />\n41\u202211.<br />\n<br />\n.411111. .111111..<br />\n<br />\nReplace Your Glasses With<br />\n<br />\nCONTACT LENSES<br />\n<br />\nthe viola de gamba.

In fact,<br />\nTom Baxter already has broken<br />\nthe law by rushing from a<br />\nrestaurant when he couldn't<br />\npay his and Cecilia's extravagant bill (he did not<br />\nrealize, of course, that his thick<br />\nwad of movie money would not<br />\nbe considered legal tender in the<br />\nreal world).<br />\nTom Baxter is Cecilia's idea<br />\n<br />\nof the perfect man, although<br />\nshe does lament the fact that he<br />\nis only fictional. He expects real<br />\nlife to be just like the movies,<br />\nup to and including fade-outs at<br />\njust the right moments.

They have yet to play a<br />\nconference game, as all those<br />\nthat were scheduled up until<br />\nnow were rained out.<br />\nAs their record indicates,<br />\nHopkins has excelled both offensively and on the pitcher's<br />\nmound.<br />\nAs for the batting, Coach<br />\nRobert Babb states that \"this<br />\nteam has hit better than any of<br />\nmy previous teams.\" The stats<br />\ncertainly back Babb up as the<br />\nBlue Jays as a team are batting<br />\na torrid .338. Of the twenty hitters, only four sport averages<br />\nunder .300.<br />\nLeft fielder Scott Burns leads<br />\nthe team with a .476 average<br />\nand a .500 on base percentage.<br />\nWillie Raedle is second in<br />\nbating, followed closely by Pete<br />\nBlohm, Craig Brooks, Tom<br />\nFinegan, Mike Goudy and<br />\nDave Psenicksa, who all are<br />\nabove .400 as well.<br />\nRaedle leads the team in<br />\nRBI's with 16, home runs with<br />\n2, and doubles. Two of his<br />\nRBI's were game winners.<br />\nOther team leaders are Dan<br />\nLandolfi in stolen bases(9 in 9<br />\nattempts) and Rob Cardwell in<br />\nwalks(14)and runs scored (19).<br />\nTo back up all of this fine<br />\nhitting, the Jays have received<br />\nMarch 10<br />\nHopkins 6<br />\nRochester 5<br />\n<br />\nsuperb work from the pitching<br />\nstaff. Their combined ERA is<br />\na stingy 3.07, and they have<br />\npermitted only 102 hits in 129<br />\ninnings.<br />\nAmong the starters, Pete<br />\nBlohm has overcome arm trouble to lead the staff with a 3-0<br />\nrecord and a 1.29 ERA. He is<br />\njoined in the fine rotation by<br />\nGeoff Bender (2-1, 14 K's),<br />\nMark Campbell (2-1, 2.25<br />\nERA), Pat Keon (1-1, 16 K's in<br />\n16 innings) and Brian Murphy<br />\n(5 starts, 2-2, 3.86 ERA). Keon<br />\nand Murphy are both lefties.<br />\nThe swingmen have been<br />\neven more outstanding. Jack<br />\nFlynn is 1-0 with a 0.87 ERA<br />\nand 15 strikeouts in only 10 1/3<br />\ninnings, while Dave Fearer has<br />\na 1.13 ERA with no decisions.<br />\nPerhaps the key to the overall<br />\nsuccess of the unit has been the<br />\nsteady relief work of Dave<br />\nPsenicksa. The freshman has<br />\nmade seven appearances, going<br />\n2-1 with two saves and a 1.83<br />\nERA.<br />\nThe only real problem that<br />\nthe Jays have encountered thus<br />\nfar is defense. the team has<br />\ncommitted 40 errors to date,<br />\nand these have allowed 24<br />\nunearned runs to score.<br />\nThe season began on March<br />\n10 with a six-day, nine-game<br />\nstay in Cocoa, Florida, and has<br />\ncontinued with the rest of the<br />\ngames thus far in the Baltimore<br />\narea.

Campbell<br />\nstruck out eight, walked three,<br />\nand gave up eight hits in an impressive performance.<br />\nLen Guarna went two for<br />\nfour with a triple, an RBI, and<br />\ntwo runs to lead the offense,<br />\nwhile Craig Brooks added two<br />\nhits.<br />\n<br />\nthe rest of the way, allowing<br />\none unearned run.<br />\nScott Burns had a big day at<br />\nthe plate with three hits in four<br />\nAB's, and two RBI's.<br />\nHopkins 6<br />\nRochester 1<br />\nPete Blohm pitched a superb<br />\ngame, allowing just four hits,<br />\ntwo walks, and one run while<br />\nregistering five K's.<br />\nHopkins scored two in the<br />\ntop of the first to give Blohm<br />\nall the cushion he needed, and<br />\nthen played error-free in the<br />\nfield for the afternoon.<br />\nAll told, the Jays tallied<br />\neleven hits and six stolen bases<br />\nin an impressive offensive<br />\nshow.

This<br />\nweek the team sets out to defend last season's Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference Championship.<br />\nTo win the MAC, the team<br />\nmust survive a fairly complicated elimination process.<br />\nThe conference is broken up<br />\nino four smaller groups, each<br />\nof which play a round-robin.<br />\nFor Hopkins, which is in the<br />\nSoutheast region, this means<br />\nplaying Elizabethtown, Dickinson, Western Maryland, and<br />\nGettysburg. The winner of this<br />\nround-robin plays the winner of<br />\nthe Southwest division, which<br />\nwill probably be Swarthmore.<br />\nThe championship is decided<br />\none match later when the winner of the South region faces<br />\nthe winner of the North.<br />\nLast year, Hopkins won a<br />\nstring of important matches to<br />\nclaim the title. First, the ladies<br />\nwon the Southeast division,<br />\nwhich then included Swarthmore. From there a 5-4 victory over Franklin & Marshall<br />\nclaimed the South. The final<br />\nmatch against the North winner, Elizabethtown, resulted in<br />\na 5-3 Hopkins victory.<br />\nAn important member of last<br />\nyear's team was Keni Fischer,<br />\ncurrently the team's captain<br />\nand lone senior. Last year, she<br />\nplayed number one doubles and<br />\nnumber two singles behind<br />\nGeraldine Klaaber. This season<br />\n<br />\nFischer has a lock on the<br />\nnumber one spot in both singles<br />\nand doubles. During the fall she<br />\ncompiled a 10-2 singles record.<br />\nHer play for the Blue Jays, as<br />\nwell as her individual performances in collegiate tournaments, have earned her an<br />\nI I th place ranking nationally<br />\nfor Division III schools.<br />\nFischer is a native of Elicott<br />\nCity, MD., but she spent her<br />\nfreshman year out-of-state. She<br />\nattended and played fourth<br />\nsingles for Bowling Green<br />\nUniversity, a Divison I school<br />\nin Ohio. Since transferring to<br />\nHopkins before her sophomore<br />\nyear, Fischer has qualified for<br />\nthe Division III national tournament twice. Both times she<br />\nqualified in doubles with<br />\nKlaaber. This season she hopes<br />\nto qualify in singles by herself.<br />\nThe fall saw the women<br />\nfinish with a disappointing 5-6<br />\nrecord. Two of the six defeats,<br />\nhowever, came at the hands of<br />\nDivision I opponents. Particularly tough were close losses<br />\nto Mary Washington College<br />\nand UMBC and an overwhelming defeat at the hands of Swarthmore. The team's highest moment came with a great team effort in its victory at the<br />\nMaryland State tournament.<br />\nOther than Fischer and<br />\nfreshman Lisa Roy, all other<br />\nmembers on the team are<br />\nsophomores. They include<br />\nKathy March, Kay Nelsen,<br />\nMonica Canilang, and Missy<br />\nPeppe. Particularly outstanding<br />\nlast fall was Nelsen, who completed the season with a perfect<br />\nsingles record.<br />\nThe first match of the spring<br />\nseason is set for tomorrow mor-<br />\n<br />\nning at 11 a.m. against Swarthmore. The last time the two<br />\nteams met was late last fall.<br />\nThis match was marred by the<br />\nabsence of Fischer and an embarrassing 8-1 Swarthmore victory. Tomorrow's match is here<br />\non the Homewood campus.<br />\nThe most important match<br />\n<br />\nDespite a dismal showing by<br />\nthe team as a whole, the men's<br />\ntrack and field season opener<br />\nwitnessed some fine performances by individual athletes.<br />\nSix team members were<br />\nresponsible for the accruement<br />\nof the 22 points with which the<br />\nJays finished at meet's end,<br />\nputting them in third place in<br />\nthe tri-meet behind competitors<br />\nFranklin & Marshall with 901/2<br />\npoints and Haverford with<br />\n1<br />\n2.<br />\n64/<br />\nThe team gained points<br />\nmainly on the strength of second place finishes, of which it<br />\nhad five. Two juniors, high<br />\njumper Olumide Danisa and<br />\npole vaulter David Sill, took the<br />\nsilver in their respective events.<br />\nThe only athlete to double score<br />\nand the one individually<br />\nresponsible for the most points,<br />\nsix in all, was senior captain<br />\nMichael Cornelison, who, in<br />\ntwo races, the 100-meter and<br />\n200-yard sprints, finished mere<br />\nfractions of a second behind<br />\nF&M's Psichos.<br />\nThe only event in which two<br />\nJays placed was the javelin, and<br />\nhere a Hopkins athlete also<br />\ntook second place, courtesy of<br />\n<br />\nfreshman Thomas Loftus.<br />\nThird place was captured by yet<br />\nanother freshman, Bradley<br />\nHandler.<br />\nCoach Robyn Landry (JHU<br />\n'84, BA, Writing Seminars,<br />\nformer Towson State Invitational Discus Champion) expressed her pride with the<br />\nthrowers' accomplishments.<br />\n\"They both have great potential, and they'll probably be<br />\nvery competitive throughout<br />\nthe season if they continue<br />\nworking hard,\" she remarked.<br />\nIndeed, Loftus' throw of 152'<br />\n9\" was only two feet behind the<br />\nwinning throw of F&M's Levy,<br />\nand Handler's 137'0\" bettered<br />\nby over sixteen feet better that<br />\nof Haverford's Wright, the<br />\nfourth place finisher.<br />\nLandry also said that \"if the<br />\nentire weight team had been<br />\nhealthy, we probably could<br />\nhave placed in shot put and<br />\nperhaps discus as well.\" As it<br />\nwas, the Jays were unable to<br />\nfield freshman Eli Kabillio and<br />\njunior Martin Birnbach in shot<br />\nand Kabillio in discus due to<br />\nunavoidable difficulties.

The teams met again in<br />\nthe championship game, and<br />\nthe Tar Heels again came out<br />\non top, 7-5.<br />\nThe 1982 squad, however,<br />\nwas a different generation of<br />\nlacrosse players than the one<br />\nDon Zimmerman and his team<br />\nface tomorrow.

These<br />\nplayers faced defeated Hopkins<br />\nonce more in the last time the<br />\nteams met on Carolina's Fetzer<br />\nField, 14-13 in double overtime.<br />\nThe Blue Jays finally found the<br />\nkey to victory, however, as they<br />\nbeat the Heels in the NCAA<br />\nsemifinal, 12-9.<br />\nSince then, the Jays have had<br />\n<br />\nJay Runners Lose<br />\nby Tammy N.

Smith was<br />\nan All-ACC selection last<br />\nspring and winner of the team's<br />\nunsung player award. He had<br />\n13 goals and five assists last<br />\nseason and was the team's<br />\nnumber two faceoff man, winning 49 of 107.<br />\nThe loss of two defensemen<br />\nwill be especially damaging for<br />\nUNC. Cox was a three-time<br />\nAll-America selection and twice<br />\nand All-ACC choice. He was a<br />\nsecond team All-America last<br />\nyear while also winning ACC<br />\nPlayer-of-the-Year honors.<br />\nHaus, who is academically ineligible this year, was a first<br />\nteam All-America and All-ACC<br />\nchoice last season.

He was part of an<br />\nextra-man defensive unit which<br />\nlimited opponents to a 0.182<br />\nsuccess rate last year, one of the<br />\nbest percentages in the country.<br />\nWalker shared the team's<br />\noutstanding freshman award<br />\nlast year and ranked third on<br />\nthe team with 67 groundballs.<br />\nTwo players who played<br />\nquite a deal on Carolina's rope<br />\nunit last season also return in<br />\nsenior Pat McDonald and<br />\nsophomore Boyd Harden. The<br />\nsuccess of the rope unit last year<br />\nhad a great deal to do with<br />\nUNC's low goals against<br />\naverage and the team's outstanding percentage on man-down<br />\ndefense.

Dr. Michael Doyle of the<br />\nDepartment of Political Science at<br />\nHopkins will be speaking on<br />\n\"Diplomacy and Political Economy in<br />\nthe New International Economic Order<br />\nNegotiaitons''.<br />\n<br />\nWHY DIVESTMENT?<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nAPARTHEID IS legalized racism in South Africa. It bears some similarities to Naziism; indeed, South African President P.W. Botha was imprisoned by<br />\nthe British during WWII for his pro-Nazi sympathies. Under Apartheid, Blacks are denied all political, economic, and social rights. 87% of the country,<br />\nincluding almost all the arable land, is set aside for the white minority. The remaining 13% is left for the blacks who form the majority of the population;<br />\nthe lands set aside for Blacks are called bantustans. As part of its apartheid policy, the South African government has forcibly moved millions of blacks<br />\nfrom their homes and has dumped them into the bantustans, barren lands capable of supporting only a fraction of the populations forced to live there.<br />\nHalf of Black children in the bantustans die before the age of five. Most suffer from malnutrition. South Africa is, however, one of the world's biggest<br />\nexporters of food.<br />\n<br />\nAPARTHEID IS AN ABOMINATION.<br />\nSO IS PROFITING FROM IT.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has stock in 45 companies that<br />\noperate in South Africa, and, although the profit<br />\nthat JHU derives from any one corporation's operations in South Africa is not great, the combination<br />\nof these tainted profits from all 45 companies is<br />\nsubstantial.<br />\nAs an expression of moral outrage, many countries, including those belonging to the European<br />\ncommon market, have partial or total trade<br />\nboycotts against South Africa. As a result, South<br />\nAfrica is desperate for trading partners and is willing to guarantee large profits. The question we at<br />\nJohns Hopkins must ask is this: Under what conditions is it moral to profit from the system of apartheid? Some say it would be moral to take the profits if JHU used its position as a stockholder to promote anti-apartheid legislation from the inside of<br />\ncorporations. But tough anti-apartheid proposals<br />\nlike Bishop Tutu's amendment have always been resoundingly defeated by stockholder voting by at<br />\nleast an 85% to 90070 margin. In other words, the<br />\ninsider approach is totally worthless because it has<br />\nno realistic chance of success. Because of the<br />\nfailures of stockholder voting, many universities<br />\nhave realized that they cannot justify making a profit from apartheid and have divested or started the<br />\ndivestment process. A select list of these universities<br />\nincludes Yale, Harvard, Amherst, Smith, Brandeis,<br />\nHaverford, Tufts, and many others.<br />\n<br />\nDivestment is the strongest statement that Johns<br />\nHopkins can make against apartheid. Divestment<br />\nsays that there is no legitimate way that we can accept profits made from apartheid, especially when<br />\nthere are many stocks not involved in South Africa<br />\nthat are equally or more profitable. The Calvert<br />\nFoundation specializes in creating profitable investment portfolios that do not include companies<br />\noperating in South Africa, and these portfolios are<br />\nmore profitable than those made up of companies<br />\noperating in South Africa. The only expense involved in divesting would be the brokers' fee. This is<br />\na small expense for the protection of our University's reputation as a leader in the fight to improve<br />\nthe quality of life around the world, a reputation<br />\nthat is tarnished by our profiting from the horrors<br />\nof apartheid. We would like to take the chance here<br />\nto quote Dr. Steven Muller, president of Johns<br />\nHopkins University:<br />\n\"The biggest failure in higher education today<br />\nis that we fall short in exposing students to values.<br />\nWe don't really provide a value framework to<br />\nyoung people who are searching for it.\"<br />\nThe issue of apartheid is a chance for this University to show some moral leadership by divesting.<br />\nWe student organizations are paying the greatest<br />\namount of attention to how the administration acts<br />\non this issue, especially in light of Johns Hopkins'<br />\npoor record on issues of social inequality; among<br />\n<br />\nthe hundreds of professors at JHU, only 5 are<br />\nblack.

The council<br />\nmade no decision on the<br />\nreferendum at the Wednesday<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nLana said he favored an individual studernt approach to<br />\nopposing the cuts. \"I would<br />\nrather see them show support<br />\nby coming to the forum Monday and writing to their congressional representatives. . ,\"<br />\nhe said. \"What we need is<br />\nspecific examples\u2014people<br />\nwriting to say, 'This is how<br />\nmuch federal aid I'm getting<br />\nand this much will be cut, and<br />\nif it is cut I won't be able to go<br />\nto school here.\"<br />\nLana said that the University Office of Governmental Affairs is lobbying against the<br />\ncuts, and that \"there are<br />\nrumors\" that University President Steven Muller may testify<br />\nbefore the U.S. House on the<br />\nthe issue. \"I think people are<br />\nstarting to gear up to oppose<br />\nthe cuts on a university level,\"<br />\nLana said, \"but it really hasn't<br />\ngone that far yet.\"<br />\nAlso at the Council meeting:<br />\n*Representatives of the Course<br />\nGuide questioned a Student Activities Commission decision to<br />\nsave money by having the semiannual curriculum review<br />\npublished in a newspaper instead of a magazine format.<br />\nColin Phoon, editor-in-chief of<br />\nthe Course Guide, cited the<br />\nsteady growth of the publication, which now receives 180<br />\npackets of questionnaires and<br />\n140 professors' statements to<br />\nreview.<br />\n\"We are improving. I think<br />\nmany people agree with that,<br />\nand to send us back to a<br />\nnewspaper format would be a<br />\nbad move,\" said Phoon.<br />\nCouncil Vice-President<br />\nKathie Eubanks agreed, saying,<br />\n\"After all the improvements<br />\nthat have happened in the past<br />\nfew years, it seems kind of<br />\npointless to make them take a<br /><br />\nstep backwards.\"<br />\nManaging Editor Bethany<br />\nSchwartz argued that, unlike<br />\nmany SAC groups, the Course<br />\nGuide serves nearly all Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates. She said that<br />\nthe magazine appearance contributed to growing student and<br />\nfaculty respect and support for<br />\nthe publication,<br />\nSAC Chairman Dwight<br />\nWilson said that there is simply too little money in the SAC<br />\nbudget to continue to support<br />\nthe Course Guide in magazine<br />\nformat. \"We have to choose<br />\nbetween funding the Course<br />\nGuide as a magazine instead of<br />\na newspaper and funding some<br />\ngroups to exist at all,\" he said.<br />\nBoth sides of the debate<br />\nagreed with Junior Class President Paul Donio, who remarked, \"I think this is part of a<br />\nlarger problem\u2014that there is<br />\nnot enough money for student<br />\nactivities. The SAC budget for<br />\nnext year is effectively for the<br />\nsame amount as this year, approximately $121,000, or about<br />\n$50 per student.\"<br />\nPan noted that, \"SAC<br />\nbudget increases certainly don't<br />\nkeep pace with tuition increases.\" The Council briefly<br />\nconsidered separating the<br />\nsource of activities funding<br />\nfrom university tuition by<br />\ncharging a student activities fee.<br />\n*Spring Fair co-Chairmen<br />\nBryce Quayle and Mike<br />\nVogelbaum reported that with<br />\ntwo weeks remaining before the<br />\nfair, preparations are proceeding on schedule. \"Now's<br />\nwhen all the fun starts. . .,\"<br />\nsaid Vogelbaum. \"See you at<br /><br />\nthe fair!\"<br />\n*Public Interest Investment<br />\nAdvisory Committee representative Brad Marks reported on<br />\nthe committee's recent activities.

He mentioned \"big attractions\" to be<br />\nannounced next week.<br />\nThe ROTC race component<br />\nof Spring Fair will also be missing this year. The race had<br />\ntraditionally been supported<br />\nthrough a large sponsorship<br />\nfrom the beer company handling the fair. This sponsorship<br />\nwas not permanent and changed every year.<br />\nThis year's run had no beer<br />\ncompany sponsorship. The fair<br />\nchairs were willing to rebudget<br /><br />\nand find money to support the<br />\nrace, according to Vogelbaum.<br />\nThe ROTC, by that time,<br />\nthought it was too late to fully<br />\npublicize and decided not to<br />\nrun the race. Permanent sponsorship of Spring Fair race is<br />\nbeing sought by a running shoe<br />\nmanufacturer to insure its<br />\npresence next year.<br />\nThe Fair Games, a new addition to this year's Spring Fair,<br />\nwill be \"an effort to encourage<br />\nincreased participation in the<br />\nHopkins community\" according to Spring Fair organizers.<br />\nAll persons affiliated with the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University are<br />\ninvited to participate.<br />\nThe competition will be<br />\norganized into five member<br />\nteams, either male, female, or<br />\nco-ed.

Douglas Jones, M.D.,<br />\nClinical Director of the<br />\nNeonatal Intensive Care Unit<br />\n(NICU) at Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, recently spoke at a<br />\nSchool of Continuing Studies<br />\nlecture about the development<br />\nof NICU in treatment of<br />\npremature infants.<br />\nNeonatal Intensive Care has<br />\nimproved dramatically within<br />\nthe last fifteen years. This is the<br />\nresult of inventions and vast<br />\nimprovements in technology<br />\nthat have simplified the care of<br />\npremature infants. Even<br />\nthough more than 80% of all<br />\npremature infants survive today, doctors are learning more<br />\nand more every day that \"life<br />\nin the uterus is no simpler than<br />\nlife outside.\"<br />\nA dramatic change in the<br />\nlikelihood that a baby born<br />\nprematurely would survive ozcurred in the mid-1970s. Before<br />\nthe 70's it was rare for a baby<br />\nborn under 3 lbs. to survive. A<br />\nstudy done at the University of<br />\nColorado showed that in<br />\n1958-1968 the mortality rate<br />\nwas 60.4% for babies weighing<br />\nless than 1500 grams (approximately 3 lbs.). This decreased<br />\nto 53.8% during the period<br />\n1970-1974 and dropped even<br />\nmore in 1975-1977 to 31%. Today a baby that weighs about<br />\n1100 grams, which is usually 11<br />\nweeks early, has a greater than<br />\n80% survival rate.<br /><br />\nWhy did this mortality rate<br />\nchange so suddenly during the<br />\nmid-1970s? Dr. Jones attributes<br />\nthis change to four major<br />\nreasons: technological advances, a change in attitude, experience, and resources. This<br />\ndramatic increase in survival<br />\ndoesn't mean that all babies<br />\naren't sick if they survive, but<br />\nmost develop normally.<br />\nIf you walk into an NICU today you will see babies attached to monitoring equipment<br />\nand many wires. Christopher<br />\nScott, who is about five years<br />\nold today, was a typical<br />\npremature baby. Electrodes<br />\nthat monitor heart rate and<br />\nrespiration were placed on his<br />\nchest, arms, and legs. He also<br />\nhad an intraarterial infusion<br />\ncatheter placed into one of the<br />\numbilical vessels that leads to a<br />\nmajor artery that serves the<br />\nlower body. Blood can be<br />\nwithdrawn from this catheter to<br />\nmonitor oxygen content<br />\nbecause many babies have problems with lung function. This<br />\nmeans that they have trouble<br />\ngetting oxygen into their blood,<br />\nChristopher also had a feeding<br />\ntube that went directly into his<br />\nstomach and an endotracheal<br />\ntube that was put into the windpipe to help with breathing. He<br />\nhad \"bad\" lung disease which<br />\nis severe in anyone but particularly harmful in a tiny baby.<br />\nThe repirator used on these<br />\nchildren is regulated so the<br />\nbabies do the vast majority of<br />\ntheir breathing on their own.<br />\nThese babies, therefore, require<br />\na lot of support to survive.<br /><br />\nMost children even do well<br />\nThe Maryland Science<br />\nwhen they have alarming<br />\nmedical problems.

The<br />\nassumption was made that if<br />\nbabies with lung disease looked better, maybe every baby<br />\nwould look healthier if given<br />\noxygen and so for a number of<br />\nyears it became common to give<br />\nlarge quantities of oxygen to<br />\npremature babies for long<br />\nperiods of time. The developing<br />\neye, which is sensitive to oxygen, was damaged and blindness usually resulted. Eye<br />\ndamage reached what was said<br />\nto be epidemic proportions.<br />\nDr. Arnold Patz, head of the<br />\nWilmer Eye Institute, was the<br />\nfirst to say that the increased<br />\nuse of oxygen was the cause of<br />\nblindness. The reaction, when<br />\nthe association between oxygen<br />\nand blindness was made, was to<br />\ncut the oxygen supply down to<br />\nlow levels. A large number of<br />\npremature babies that needed<br />\noxygen to survive either didn't<br />\nsurvive this or were severely<br />\ndamaged. At first there was a<br />\ngross overusav of oxygen,<br />\nalbeit with good intentions, in<br />\nthe 40's and 50's, it was then<br />\nfollowed by a rather strange<br />\nand unreasonable restriction of<br />\noxygen use. This began in the<br />\nmid-1950s and extended until it<br />\nbecame possible to measure the<br />\narterial concentration of oxygen. This is the actual partial<br />\npressure of oxygen in the lungs.<br />\nThis important technological<br />\nadvance was critical to modern<br />\nNIC.<br />\nfrom the nineIt was known<br />\nteenth century that heat could<br />\nhelp nurture the premature infant. One of the original incubators had an oil flame that<br />\nwould heat a reservoir of water<br />\nat the bottom. Air would circulate around the warm water<br />\nreservoir and rise up around the<br />\nbaby to keep it warm.<br />\nIn the late nineteenth century, a French obstetrician<br /><br />\nJess Bunshaft<br />\nM. Douglas Jones, M.D., lecturing about neonatal intensive care<br /><br />\nnamed Boudan systematically<br />\nlooked at the effect of warmth<br />\non the survival of premature infants. His incubator was first<br />\ntried out at the Paris zoo with<br />\nchimpanzees.<br />\nMartin Kooney, one of<br />\nBoudan's followers, was SO<br />\nenamored with premature<br />\nbabies and how well they did in<br />\nthese incubators that he decided to publicize his findings.<br />\nPartially as a way of raising<br />\nmoney and also because of its<br />\nstunt aspects, he went to the<br />\nBerlin Exposition in the 1890s.<br />\nHis circus sideshow, called a<br />\n\"child hatchery,\" consisted of<br />\nmany premature babies in incubators set up so the public<br />\ncould come in and observe<br />\nthem. At the Pan-American<br />\nExposition in Buffalo, he built<br />\na big building called \"Infant Incubators.\" Inside he placed incubators along the walls with<br />\nnurses watching over each<br />\nbaby. Kooney found this so<br />\nsuccessful that he actually moved his show to Coney Island.<br />\nHis incubator side show stayed<br />\nthere until the N.Y. World's<br />\nFair of 1939.<br />\nThese babies were unlikely to<br />\nsurvive otherwise so the public<br />\nnever questioned Kooney's actions. Doctors thought that it<br /><br />\nwas important to keep the<br />\nbabies isolated so the incubators were covered with<br />\nglass. Unfortunately they<br />\nthought at the time that it was<br />\nequally important to keep<br />\nbabies separated from their<br />\nparents. This is a practice that<br />\nonly ended about 10 or 15 years<br />\nago. Today parents are encouraged to spend a lot of time<br />\nwith their babies.<br />\nThe concepts about warmth,<br />\nexpressed carefully in Boudan's<br />\nbook \"The Nurseling,\" were<br />\nforgotten until the late 1950s<br />\nand early 60's. It wasn't<br />\nremembered how exquisitely<br />\nsensitive these tiny babies were<br />\nto rather small changes in environmental temperature. Data<br />\ncompiled in 1964 show the great<br />\nincrease in survival rate for a<br />\nsmall gradient in temperature.<br />\nBabies kept at 34.5 degrees<br />\nCelsius have a 51% survival<br />\nrate, while babies kept at 36<br />\ndegrees have a survival rate of<br />\n8201o. It thus became apparent<br />\nthat the simplx measure of<br />\nkeeping babies warm was extraordinarily important in<br />\ndetermining how likely they<br />\nwere to survive.<br />\nNext week: Today's NIC.<br /><br />\nCUNARD 1985<br /><br />\nEIROPEONSALIV<br /><br />\nYou've seen the poster,<br />\nYou've seen the banner,<br />\nYou read the article,<br />\nYou got the flyer in your mailbox,<br />\nAnd now you're reading this.<br /><br />\nSO GIVE US A BREAK!<br /><br />\nREGISTER NOW<br />\nthe<br />\nat<br /><br />\nUnion Desk<br /><br />\nAND ICRANDAM INCLUDES ALL THESE EXTRAS:<br /><br />\n.

It's an<br />\nunusually warm day for March;<br />\nNorthern<br />\nCalifornia is<br />\nnotorious for its chilly weather<br />\nand frequent showers which<br />\ndrive even the most devout<br />\nbongo players into cappucino<br />\ncafes for cover. But today they<br />\nare out on Telegraph Avenue,<br />\nBerkeley's main strip, pounding<br />\naway. Berkeley residents in tiedyed teeshirts sway arhythmically, yet enthusiastically, to the<br />\ndrums.<br />\nThere is a ragged man waving his hands and shouting<br />\nabout Salvation and Filthy<br />\nLust. No one notices him as<br />\nthey stroll by to the hairdresser,<br />\npizza parlour, or class; he is<br />\nmerely one of an army of street<br />\ncrazies. This is the Berkeley I<br />\nexpected; street vendors selling<br />\nfelafel and earrings, adorable<br />\nblonds on mopeds, croissant<br />\nshops and Egyptian fast food<br />\non every corner.<br />\nThe hectic step of the East<br />\nCoast has vanished; instead,<br />\nyou have a languid trail of convertibles snaking up Hearst<br />\nAvenue, stopping for any<br />\npedestrian, real or imagined.<br />\nOn my first day in the Bay<br />\nArea, I waited for the cars to<br />\npass; however, I discovered my<br />\nlawfulness was causing a traffic jam among the Hondas ignoring their green light. I wised up fast.<br />\nThe other strange thing you<br />\nnotice about the street is the<br />\nlack of hassling. No wolf<br />\nwhistles, no lust-crazed declarations, no profanity. Walking by<br />\na group of construction<br />\nworkers leaning against their<br />\nequipment, I was subjected to<br />\na polite, \"Good morning, how<br />\nare you doing?\" \"Fine,\" I<br />\nreplied, taking off my<br />\nsunglasses. Evidently they had<br />\nbeen trained by Bay Area<br />\nfeminists. Now I felt guilty<br />\nlooking at their biceps.<br />\nThere are bodies everywhere.<br />\nTaut torsos, and long, lean<br />\ngolden legs honed by years of<br />\njogging. Every morning I<br />\nawake to the gentle slapping of<br />\nfeet against pavement. Running<br /><br />\nhas become a cliched part of<br />\nlife; no one gets credit for doing it any more. Trendy boutiques sell teeshirts proclaiming,<br />\n\"Did Not Run in Bay for<br />\nBreakers,\" referring to a<br />\npopular marathon across the<br />\nGolden Gate Bridge.<br />\nTrue to form, running is<br />\nabout the only activity outside<br />\nof walking allowed on UC<br />\nBerkeley's 178 acres. No<br />\nmoped-ing, skate-boarding,<br />\nand certainly no roller-skating;<br />\nindeed, one JHU student who<br />\nshall remain nameless was bodily removed from campus by<br />\ntwo hefty security guards for<br />\nthis offense. You can tell those<br />\nEast Coast kids right away.<br />\nCampus security at Berkeley<br />\nis an awesome force for an area<br />\nwhich suffers little crime. The<br />\nofficers carry guns and recently roughed up several students<br />\nprotesting apartheid. In March,<br />\n1000 students protested University investments in South Africa<br />\nand several spent more than<br />\none night in jail.<br />\nThe birth of the campus antiapartheid movement last fall<br />\nwas an interesting one. The San<br />\nFrancisco Chronicle had<br />\nreported activism was dead at<br />\nBerkeley; after all, many<br />\nstudents were engineers or<br />\nvoted for Reagan, which is<br />\nclose enough in some eyes. The<br />\nstudents didn't like this. It shattered their vision of a progressive, active, \"happenning\"<br />\ncampus. After all, weren't they<br />\nonce the core of national<br />\nunrest?<br />\nFour days after the notorious<br />\narticle, a student group began<br />\nworking on South African<br />\nawareness. Now, the campus'<br />\nDaily Californian devotes practically an article a day to the<br />\nburgeoning movement.<br />\nGenerally, the campus paper<br />\ncovers much harder news topics<br />\nthan the Chronicle. This morning paper gives credence tc<br />\nevery nasty rumor about tht<br />\nCalifornian's spaced-out<br />\nnature. The Chronicle is laid<br />\nout like a tabloid and covers<br />\nstories like \"How to Marry<br />\nMoney,\" \"Pets of the Rich,\"<br />\nand \"Lately We've Been Talking About Having Sex.\" There<br />\nis Gerald Nachman's daily column titled \"The Single Life,\"<br />\nin which he laments his relationships: women want corn-<br /><br />\nmitment, women live too tar<br />\naway to drive to, on and on,ad<br />\nnauseum.<br /><br />\nBut \"The Single Life\" pales<br />\nin comparison with the movie<br />\nand society columns, which<br />\nrecently devoted a lot of space<br />\nto the San Francisco premiere<br />\nof an X-rated flick called \"The<br />\nGrafenburg Spot.\" Besides<br />\ndiscussing the film's merits and<br />\nits audience, the reviewer let us<br />\nin on his personal feelings<br />\nabout G-spots as well.<br />\nAll this talk of love and<br />\nwhat-not made me curious<br />\nabout the real status of relationships in San Francisco. I<br />\nwandered down to HaightAshbury, that old mecca of free<br />\nlove and drugs, one Friday<br />\nnight. I found neither, and<br />\nthere were just a handful of<br />\nhippies and derelicts. There<br />\nwere plenty of sweet young<br />\nthings with mohawked heads<br />\nswinging into the I-Beam in<br />\ntheir plastic jeans.<br />\nThe I-Beam and Chi-Chi<br />\nClubspecialize in hot new bands<br />\nsuch as The Stupeds and The<br />\nFreaky Executives. There is a<br />\ncover charge for admission into the ranks of the hip, so we<br />\n(two East Coast girls, two<br />\nbrutally beautiful Berkeley<br />\nboys) slouched into another<br />\nclub called the Anxious Asp,<br />\nwhich a long-haired patron<br />\nassured us was \"hell of<br />\nawesome!\" as he ran down the<br />\nstreet.<br />\nThe Anxious Asp was a dark,<br />\nsmoky little bar with tiny tables<br />\nand an intimate dance floor. A<br />\nsullen-looking waitress served<br />\nus stiff vodka tonics with her<br />\nfingerless lace gloves.

Of course, not<br />\nbeing a standout in such company is no slight on a dish.<br />\nNow the rest of the meal arrived: numerous steamer bowls<br />\ncontaining dumplings and<br />\nsteamed buns. As these were<br />\ndistributed about the already<br />\ncrowded table by the waiter, I<br />\nsampled the camphor and tea<br />\nsmoked duck.

The small buns<br />\nwere made of somewhat thinner<br />\nshells of the same pastry and<br />\nfilled with a very solidly meaty<br />\npork ball.

The Purple Rose of<br />\nCairo is not entirely in color,<br />\nthough; there are some black<br />\nand white sequences and, as<br />\nridiculous a statement as this<br />\nmay first seem, Allen's use of<br />\ncolor in Purple Rose actually<br />\nseems to reinforce, not depart<br />\nfrom, his use of black and<br />\nwhite in the past. Confused?<br />\nThere is another famous film<br />\nwith sequences both in color<br />\nand black and white: The<br />\nWizard of Oz. But the use of<br />\nblack and white and the use of<br />\ncolor work in an entirely opposite fashion in The Wizard of<br />\nOz as they do in The Purple<br />\nRose of Cairo. In The Wizard<br />\nof Oz, the black and white sequences were used to show the<br />\nboring and mundane qualities<br /><br />\nby Steve Brett<br />\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo<br />\nseems to mark more than one<br />\ndeparture from what has<br />\nbecome the norm for filmmaker Woody Allen. First of<br />\nall, he is conspicuous in his<br />\nabsence from the screen. This<br />\nis not the first time Mr. Allen<br />\nhas restricted his involvement<br />\nto the other side of the camera,<br />\nbut his earlir effort (1978's Interiors) was a drama, and Mr.<br />\nAllen is known solely as a comedic actor. Mr. Allen himself<br />\nhas indicated, though, that he<br />\ndid not feel it was necessary to<br />\nsacrifice making the comedy<br />\nThe Purple Rose of Cairo simply because the idea of the film<br />\ndid not include a part for him<br />\nto play.<br />\nAnother difference from<br />\nusual Woody Allen work, and<br />\nperhaps more striking from an<br />\nartistic point of view, is Mr.<br /><br />\nof Dorothy's Kansas, as compared to the exciting color fantasyland of Oz. In Purple Rose,<br />\nhowever, black and white is the<br />\nfantasy world and color is the<br />\nmundane real life. The Purple<br />\nRose of Cairo takes place during the depression, and Mr.<br />\nAllen's use of black and white<br />\nversus color accurately<br />\nrepresents what life was like in<br />\nthe United States at the time:<br />\none could not help but see the<br />\ndepressed real world in color,<br />\nperhaps the only escape being<br />\nthe black and white fantasy<br />\nworld of the movies. The black<br />\nand white scenes of The Purple<br />\nRose of Cairo all take place in<br />\na movie-within-the-movie.<br />\nBasically, in The Purple Rose<br />\nof Cairo, Mr. Allen has shown<br />\n\"black and white\" to be the<br />\nthing that separates movies<br />\nfrom reality. How much of a<br />\ndeparture is this statement for<br />\na man who has elected to make<br /><br />\nHusker Dil: New Day Rising<br />\nby Peter Oehlkers<br />\nHusker Du, New Day Rising,<br />\nSST Records.<br />\nI gotta make plans for the<br />\nplans I make<br />\nGotta have friends for the<br />\nfriends I make<br />\nI gotta make plans for the<br />\nfriends I make<br />\nGotta have friends for the<br />\nplans I make<br />\n\u2014\"Plans I Make\"<br />\nAt the beginning of last summer, Husker Du released an<br />\nalbum that is already semilegendary\u2014Zen Arcade\u2014a two<br />\nrecord set that shattered conceptions of what hard<br />\ncore/punk was capable of. It<br />\nwas at various times acoustic,<br />\nHeavy Metalish, poppish, and<br />\npsychedelic, but it was.<br /><br />\nthoroughly punk in execution<br />\nand philosophy. And like any<br />\ntrue punk album (or rock &amp; roll<br />\nalbum for that matter) it was<br />\nspontaneous and uncontrived<br />\n\u2014recorded and mixed in the<br />\nunheard of time of 85 hours.<br />\nAnd like any true punk album,<br />\nas a result of spontaneity, it had<br />\nits share of misses; it wasn't perfect, occasionally long and<br />\noccasionally self-indulgent.<br />\nThus the release of New Day<br />\nRising was eagerly awaited.<br />\nAfter having honed their skills<br />\na bit more (but not too much<br />\nmind you) would Husker Du<br />\nmake an album that was truly<br />\ngreat? Well. . . not yet. New<br />\nDay Rising is a step in the right<br />\ndirection for the band, but it<br />\nhas some rather major<br />\nproblems.<br />\nIt's hard to believe that this<br />\nis the same Husker Du that was<br /><br />\nUST FILM<br />\nOF I E YEAR<br />\nUST DIRECTOR<br />\nOF IRE YEAR<br /><br />\nA SlaNty Olubmk P,Cluk\u2022 .,\u2022\u2022 A<br /><br />\nA 1,1414(HANGt<br /><br />\nCor\u2022 and VI.11P1 Kr. \u2022<br /><br />\n'A Clockwork Orange Is one of the<br />\nfew perfect movies I have seen In my<br />\nNewt N AS,day News<br />\nlifetime.<br /><br />\nBEST PICTURE<br />\nBEST DIRECTOR<br /><br />\nWINNER N Y FILM CRITICS AwARUS<br /><br />\nsuch a run-of-the-mill hardcore<br />\nband just a few years ago.<br />\nThankfully their development<br />\nout of hardcore has led them in<br />\na more thoughtful direction<br />\nthan bands like Black Flag and<br />\nSSD which are now blatantly<br />\nHeavy Metal.

Cecilia, played by<br />\nMia Farrow, spends so much<br />\ntime at the Jewel escaping dayto-day reality that she is on a<br />\nfirst-name basis with all of the<br />\ntheater's employees. Her oppressive, out-of-work, violent<br />\nhusband (Danny Aiello), who<br />\ngambles away the money just as<br />\nfast as she makes it by waitressing, is just one of these realities<br />\nfrom which she needs an<br />\nescape. Another one comes in<br />\nthe form of her own unemployment. Fired because of her own<br />\nineptitude, her only means of<br />\nescape is the latest offering at<br />\nthe Jewel, which she has seen a<br />\nnumber of times already. In<br />\nfact, someone at the theater<br />\ncomments upon Cecilia's having been back to see Purple<br />\nRose so many times: \"You<br />\nmust really love this movie,\" he<br />\ntells her.

The band<br />\nseems world-weary before its<br />\ntime. When drummer Grant<br />\nHart sings about \"The Girl<br />\nWho Lives on Heaven Hill,\"<br />\nalthough he seems to be in love<br />\nwith her, he winds up screaming. At the end of \"Plans I<br />\nMake,\" guitarist Bob Mould,<br />\nseems genuinely sick and tired<br />\nof it all. Yet there is still<br />\nunderneath it all the essential<br />\npunk stubborness\u2014the unwillingness to admit defeat. There<br />\nis a good reason why this album<br />\nis entitled New Day Rising.<br />\nThere is also a good reason why<br />\nBob Mould is reduced to<br />\nscreaming those three words<br />\nover and over during the title<br />\ntrack.<br />\nMusically, Husker Du<br />\ndoesn't vary as much as they<br />\ndid on Zen Arcade. All the<br />\nsongs are built on the same<br />\nmodel\u2014Mould lays down a<br />\nbuzzing guitar drone (nearly<br />\nelectronic static, really) and<br />\nthey go from there\u2014sometimes<br />\nfast and loud (though never to<br />\nhardcore standards), sometimes<br />\nquite tuneful. Remarkably<br />\nenough, the result is a quite<br />\nfolky sound. In fact Grant<br />\nHart's \"Terms of Psychic Warfare\" sounds a lot like a Bob<br />\nDylan piece. That these guys<br />\nhave been affected by their lives<br />\nin the Midwest (Minnesota) is<br />\ntrue without a doubt.<br />\n41111. .111110 411N1b 4101.<br /><br />\nBut the problems...This<br />\nalbum is hampered by truly bad<br />\nproduction. \"Spot,\" who produces most of the stuff at SST<br />\nis usually pretty competent. Not<br />\nhere. Mould's guitar sometimes<br />\nbuzzes so loudly that you can't<br />\nhear anything else. Most of the<br />\nvocals are mixed so far down<br />\nthey're reduced to mumblings,<br />\nalthough at least once this is intentional. Luckily they've included a lyric sheet so things are<br />\nmuch less frustrating than they<br />\nmight have been. In fact, this<br />\nproblem is not insurmountable;<br />\nthe more you listen to the<br />\nrecord, the more you get used<br />\nto the production, however, a<br />\nfirst listen might be enough to<br />\nturn someone off altogether.<br />\nThe other problem makes me<br />\nthink that this album was rushed along a little too quickly. It<br />\nseems like some of the songs<br />\nweren't completely worked out<br />\n(e.g. the chorus in \"Folklore\")<br />\nand other songs are just filler<br />\n(\"How to Skin a Cat,\" \"Whatcha Drinkin'?\"). While most of<br />\nthe songs are strong enough to<br />\nwithstand the production, these<br />\nsongs disappear in their<br />\nmurkiness.<br />\nThus, New Day Rising is not<br />\nthe album everyone's been<br />\nwaiting for, but it too, like Zen<br />\nArcade, shows a great deal of<br />\npromise for Husker Du. When<br />\neverything does come together,<br />\nas on \"The Girl Who Lives on<br />\nHeaven Hill,\" it's breathtaking. Now I am pretty sick of<br />\nall that \"America's Back\"<br />\nsloganeering, but as far as rock<br />\nmusic is concerned, with bands<br />\nlike Husker Du we can take all<br />\ncomers.<br />\n.imer<br /><br />\n4111.<br /><br />\n4101. .1111. dan.<br /><br />\nFREE TEE SHIRT OFFER!!<br />\nI<br /><br />\nDORMS \u2022 ORGANIZATIONS<br />\nI \u2022 TEAMS \u2022 SCHOOL GROUPS \u2022<br />\nfor JOHNS HOPKINS ONLY<br />\nGROUP DISCOUNTS<br />\nFREE PICK-UP &amp; DELIVERY<br /><br />\nT-Shirts<br />\nJackets<br /><br />\nSweatshirts<br />\nSportswear<br /><br />\nCall anytime for details!<br />\nRoyal Tees T-Shirt Centers<br />\n&amp;<br />\n764-6474<br />\n682-4076<br />\nGrossman<br />\nI Ask for Seth<br /><br />\nServing Hopkins for 6 years<br /><br />\n.14.111. 411\u202210. .1111111. 411110.<br /><br />\n411MIN.<br /><br />\n41\u202211.<br /><br />\n.411111. .111111..<br /><br />\nReplace Your Glasses With<br /><br />\nCONTACT LENSES<br /><br />\nthe viola de gamba.

He is not quite as<br />\nnice as his creation, but Gil<br />\ndoes hold one distinct advantage over Tom: Gil is real. In<br />\nthe end, Cecilia has to make a<br />\npainful choice between these<br />\ntwo men in her life (her husband, at this point, is out of the<br />\nquestion. In fact, he is such a<br />\nhuge, obnoxious, overbearing<br />\ncharacter compared to the<br />\nslight and sweet Mia Farrow,<br />\none wonders how the couple<br />\never got married to begin with).<br />\nA character walking off the<br />\nmovie screen is about as implausible as one can get, and<br />\ncauld obviously form the basis<br />\nof a terrifically slapstick movie.<br />\nIt is to Woody Allen's credit<br />\nthat he manages to keep The<br />\nPurple Rose of Cairo, his thirteenth directorial effort, as lowkey as it is. It all seems so real,<br />\nnot as truly ridiculous as the<br />\npremise would at first appear.<br />\nThe comedy element is there,<br />\nthough, even if it is not as pronounced as it is in other Allen<br />\nfilms, such as Sleeper, Love<br />\nand Death, or Take The Money<br />\nand Run (one scene here which<br />\nis an exception involves the<br />\nmaitre d' of the movie within<br />\nthe movie's fancy restaturant).<br />\nIn fact, the film is much like<br />\nMr. Allen's own Play it Again,<br />\nSam (written by and starring<br />\nAllen, but directed by Herbert<br />\nRoss), where Humphrey Bogart<br />\nwalks into Woody the movie<br />\ncritic's life to pass on Bogart's<br />\nown brand of advice.

Don't go expecting nothing but belly laughs;<br />\njust as the characters in Allen's<br />\nown Stardust Memories would<br />\nlament, this is not like one of<br />\nWoody Allen's \"older, funny\"<br />\nfilms, but Purple Rose is a good<br />\nmovie just the same.

They have yet to play a<br />\nconference game, as all those<br />\nthat were scheduled up until<br />\nnow were rained out.<br />\nAs their record indicates,<br />\nHopkins has excelled both offensively and on the pitcher's<br />\nmound.<br />\nAs for the batting, Coach<br />\nRobert Babb states that \"this<br />\nteam has hit better than any of<br />\nmy previous teams.\" The stats<br />\ncertainly back Babb up as the<br />\nBlue Jays as a team are batting<br />\na torrid .338. Of the twenty hitters, only four sport averages<br />\nunder .300.<br />\nLeft fielder Scott Burns leads<br />\nthe team with a .476 average<br />\nand a .500 on base percentage.<br />\nWillie Raedle is second in<br />\nbating, followed closely by Pete<br />\nBlohm, Craig Brooks, Tom<br />\nFinegan, Mike Goudy and<br />\nDave Psenicksa, who all are<br />\nabove .400 as well.<br />\nRaedle leads the team in<br />\nRBI's with 16, home runs with<br />\n2, and doubles.

Their combined ERA is<br />\na stingy 3.07, and they have<br />\npermitted only 102 hits in 129<br />\ninnings.<br />\nAmong the starters, Pete<br />\nBlohm has overcome arm trouble to lead the staff with a 3-0<br />\nrecord and a 1.29 ERA.

The freshman has<br />\nmade seven appearances, going<br />\n2-1 with two saves and a 1.83<br />\nERA.<br />\nThe only real problem that<br />\nthe Jays have encountered thus<br />\nfar is defense. the team has<br />\ncommitted 40 errors to date,<br />\nand these have allowed 24<br />\nunearned runs to score.<br />\nThe season began on March<br />\n10 with a six-day, nine-game<br />\nstay in Cocoa, Florida, and has<br />\ncontinued with the rest of the<br />\ngames thus far in the Baltimore<br />\narea.

This<br />\nweek the team sets out to defend last season's Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference Championship.<br />\nTo win the MAC, the team<br />\nmust survive a fairly complicated elimination process.<br />\nThe conference is broken up<br />\nino four smaller groups, each<br />\nof which play a round-robin.<br />\nFor Hopkins, which is in the<br />\nSoutheast region, this means<br />\nplaying Elizabethtown, Dickinson, Western Maryland, and<br />\nGettysburg. The winner of this<br />\nround-robin plays the winner of<br />\nthe Southwest division, which<br />\nwill probably be Swarthmore.<br />\nThe championship is decided<br />\none match later when the winner of the South region faces<br />\nthe winner of the North.<br />\nLast year, Hopkins won a<br />\nstring of important matches to<br />\nclaim the title. First, the ladies<br />\nwon the Southeast division,<br />\nwhich then included Swarthmore. From there a 5-4 victory over Franklin &amp; Marshall<br />\nclaimed the South. The final<br />\nmatch against the North winner, Elizabethtown, resulted in<br />\na 5-3 Hopkins victory.<br />\nAn important member of last<br />\nyear's team was Keni Fischer,<br />\ncurrently the team's captain<br />\nand lone senior. Last year, she<br />\nplayed number one doubles and<br />\nnumber two singles behind<br />\nGeraldine Klaaber. This season<br /><br />\nFischer has a lock on the<br />\nnumber one spot in both singles<br />\nand doubles. During the fall she<br />\ncompiled a 10-2 singles record.<br />\nHer play for the Blue Jays, as<br />\nwell as her individual performances in collegiate tournaments, have earned her an<br />\nI I th place ranking nationally<br />\nfor Division III schools.<br />\nFischer is a native of Elicott<br />\nCity, MD., but she spent her<br />\nfreshman year out-of-state. She<br />\nattended and played fourth<br />\nsingles for Bowling Green<br />\nUniversity, a Divison I school<br />\nin Ohio. Since transferring to<br />\nHopkins before her sophomore<br />\nyear, Fischer has qualified for<br />\nthe Division III national tournament twice. Both times she<br />\nqualified in doubles with<br />\nKlaaber. This season she hopes<br />\nto qualify in singles by herself.<br />\nThe fall saw the women<br />\nfinish with a disappointing 5-6<br />\nrecord. Two of the six defeats,<br />\nhowever, came at the hands of<br />\nDivision I opponents. Particularly tough were close losses<br />\nto Mary Washington College<br />\nand UMBC and an overwhelming defeat at the hands of Swarthmore. The team's highest moment came with a great team effort in its victory at the<br />\nMaryland State tournament.<br />\nOther than Fischer and<br />\nfreshman Lisa Roy, all other<br />\nmembers on the team are<br />\nsophomores. They include<br />\nKathy March, Kay Nelsen,<br />\nMonica Canilang, and Missy<br />\nPeppe. Particularly outstanding<br />\nlast fall was Nelsen, who completed the season with a perfect<br />\nsingles record.<br />\nThe first match of the spring<br />\nseason is set for tomorrow mor-<br /><br />\nning at 11 a.m. against Swarthmore. The last time the two<br />\nteams met was late last fall.<br />\nThis match was marred by the<br />\nabsence of Fischer and an embarrassing 8-1 Swarthmore victory. Tomorrow's match is here<br />\non the Homewood campus.<br />\nThe most important match<br /><br />\nDespite a dismal showing by<br />\nthe team as a whole, the men's<br />\ntrack and field season opener<br />\nwitnessed some fine performances by individual athletes.<br />\nSix team members were<br />\nresponsible for the accruement<br />\nof the 22 points with which the<br />\nJays finished at meet's end,<br />\nputting them in third place in<br />\nthe tri-meet behind competitors<br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall with 901/2<br />\npoints and Haverford with<br />\n1<br />\n2.<br />\n64/<br />\nThe team gained points<br />\nmainly on the strength of second place finishes, of which it<br />\nhad five. Two juniors, high<br />\njumper Olumide Danisa and<br />\npole vaulter David Sill, took the<br />\nsilver in their respective events.<br />\nThe only athlete to double score<br />\nand the one individually<br />\nresponsible for the most points,<br />\nsix in all, was senior captain<br />\nMichael Cornelison, who, in<br />\ntwo races, the 100-meter and<br />\n200-yard sprints, finished mere<br />\nfractions of a second behind<br />\nF&amp;M's Psichos.<br />\nThe only event in which two<br />\nJays placed was the javelin, and<br />\nhere a Hopkins athlete also<br />\ntook second place, courtesy of<br /><br />\nfreshman Thomas Loftus.<br />\nThird place was captured by yet<br />\nanother freshman, Bradley<br />\nHandler.<br />\nCoach Robyn Landry (JHU<br />\n'84, BA, Writing Seminars,<br />\nformer Towson State Invitational Discus Champion) expressed her pride with the<br />\nthrowers' accomplishments.<br />\n\"They both have great potential, and they'll probably be<br />\nvery competitive throughout<br />\nthe season if they continue<br />\nworking hard,\" she remarked.<br />\nIndeed, Loftus' throw of 152'<br />\n9\" was only two feet behind the<br />\nwinning throw of F&amp;M's Levy,<br />\nand Handler's 137'0\" bettered<br />\nby over sixteen feet better that<br />\nof Haverford's Wright, the<br />\nfourth place finisher.<br />\nLandry also said that \"if the<br />\nentire weight team had been<br />\nhealthy, we probably could<br />\nhave placed in shot put and<br />\nperhaps discus as well.\" As it<br />\nwas, the Jays were unable to<br />\nfield freshman Eli Kabillio and<br />\njunior Martin Birnbach in shot<br />\nand Kabillio in discus due to<br />\nunavoidable difficulties.

Smith was<br />\nan All-ACC selection last<br />\nspring and winner of the team's<br />\nunsung player award. He had<br />\n13 goals and five assists last<br />\nseason and was the team's<br />\nnumber two faceoff man, winning 49 of 107.<br />\nThe loss of two defensemen<br />\nwill be especially damaging for<br />\nUNC. Cox was a three-time<br />\nAll-America selection and twice<br />\nand All-ACC choice. He was a<br />\nsecond team All-America last<br />\nyear while also winning ACC<br />\nPlayer-of-the-Year honors.<br />\nHaus, who is academically ineligible this year, was a first<br />\nteam All-America and All-ACC<br />\nchoice last season.

He was part of an<br />\nextra-man defensive unit which<br />\nlimited opponents to a 0.182<br />\nsuccess rate last year, one of the<br />\nbest percentages in the country.<br />\nWalker shared the team's<br />\noutstanding freshman award<br />\nlast year and ranked third on<br />\nthe team with 67 groundballs.<br />\nTwo players who played<br />\nquite a deal on Carolina's rope<br />\nunit last season also return in<br />\nsenior Pat McDonald and<br />\nsophomore Boyd Harden.

It bears some similarities to Naziism; indeed, South African President P.W. Botha was imprisoned by<br />\nthe British during WWII for his pro-Nazi sympathies. Under Apartheid, Blacks are denied all political, economic, and social rights. 87% of the country,<br />\nincluding almost all the arable land, is set aside for the white minority. The remaining 13% is left for the blacks who form the majority of the population;<br />\nthe lands set aside for Blacks are called bantustans. As part of its apartheid policy, the South African government has forcibly moved millions of blacks<br />\nfrom their homes and has dumped them into the bantustans, barren lands capable of supporting only a fraction of the populations forced to live there.<br />\nHalf of Black children in the bantustans die before the age of five. Most suffer from malnutrition. South Africa is, however, one of the world's biggest<br />\nexporters of food.<br /><br />\nAPARTHEID IS AN ABOMINATION.<br />\nSO IS PROFITING FROM IT.<br />\nJohns Hopkins has stock in 45 companies that<br />\noperate in South Africa, and, although the profit<br />\nthat JHU derives from any one corporation's operations in South Africa is not great, the combination<br />\nof these tainted profits from all 45 companies is<br />\nsubstantial.<br />\nAs an expression of moral outrage, many countries, including those belonging to the European<br />\ncommon market, have partial or total trade<br />\nboycotts against South Africa. As a result, South<br />\nAfrica is desperate for trading partners and is willing to guarantee large profits. The question we at<br />\nJohns Hopkins must ask is this: Under what conditions is it moral to profit from the system of apartheid? Some say it would be moral to take the profits if JHU used its position as a stockholder to promote anti-apartheid legislation from the inside of<br />\ncorporations. But tough anti-apartheid proposals<br />\nlike Bishop Tutu's amendment have always been resoundingly defeated by stockholder voting by at<br />\nleast an 85% to 90070 margin. In other words, the<br />\ninsider approach is totally worthless because it has<br />\nno realistic chance of success. Because of the<br />\nfailures of stockholder voting, many universities<br />\nhave realized that they cannot justify making a profit from apartheid and have divested or started the<br />\ndivestment process. A select list of these universities<br />\nincludes Yale, Harvard, Amherst, Smith, Brandeis,<br />\nHaverford, Tufts, and many others.<br /><br />\nDivestment is the strongest statement that Johns<br />\nHopkins can make against apartheid. Divestment<br />\nsays that there is no legitimate way that we can accept profits made from apartheid, especially when<br />\nthere are many stocks not involved in South Africa<br />\nthat are equally or more profitable. The Calvert<br />\nFoundation specializes in creating profitable investment portfolios that do not include companies<br />\noperating in South Africa, and these portfolios are<br />\nmore profitable than those made up of companies<br />\noperating in South Africa. The only expense involved in divesting would be the brokers' fee. This is<br />\na small expense for the protection of our University's reputation as a leader in the fight to improve<br />\nthe quality of life around the world, a reputation<br />\nthat is tarnished by our profiting from the horrors<br />\nof apartheid. We would like to take the chance here<br />\nto quote Dr. Steven Muller, president of Johns<br />\nHopkins University:<br />\n\"The biggest failure in higher education today<br />\nis that we fall short in exposing students to values.<br />\nWe don't really provide a value framework to<br />\nyoung people who are searching for it.\"<br />\nThe issue of apartheid is a chance for this University to show some moral leadership by divesting.<br />\nWe student organizations are paying the greatest<br />\namount of attention to how the administration acts<br />\non this issue, especially in light of Johns Hopkins'<br />\npoor record on issues of social inequality; among<br /><br />\nthe hundreds of professors at JHU, only 5 are<br />\nblack.
