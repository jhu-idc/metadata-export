I have decided, with my running<br />\nmate Amir Halevy, to seize the Student<br />\nCouncil presidency and vice-presidency at<br />\nthis time. I will now issue a brief comment<br />\non the actions that forced us to take this<br />\nnecessary step.<br />\nAmir and I have been frustrated by the<br />\ndivisiveness that has marked Council<br />\nproceedings this year. On each of the<br />\nissues facing it\u2014the new constitution, the<br />\nSpring Fair date, and the performance of<br />\nits committees--the Council has brazenly<br />\nignored overwhelming student indifference<br />\nand has managed to fabricate several<br />\nopinions on each topic, leading to lengthy<br />\ndebate. The approach to solving problems-the recognition of two and sometimes even<br />\nmore sides to an issue--is clearly serving<br />\nonly to reinforce the Council's divisiveness.<br />\nLast week, Amir and I attempted to<br />\nmend these cracks by announcing our<br />\ncandidacy along a \"party line.\" We agreed<br />\nto work in tandem and tried to emphasize<br />\nthe beauty of this system to the students:<br />\nthere would be no further divisions of the<br />\nCouncil. A single decision would be made<br />\n<br />\nand stuck with. I wanted to take the<br />\npolitics out of it.<br />\nBut the old order sought, characteristically, to resist new blood. In an action<br />\nwhich was purely sour grapes, the Elections<br />\nCommission proposed extending the filing<br />\ndeadline for new candidates. The motion,<br />\nwhich was easily passed amidst the usual<br />\nbickering, could have the effect of introducing even more fragmentation and<br />\nfactionalism by widening the spectrum of<br />\ncandidates and issues.<br />\nThat did it. The final and ultimate<br />\nauthority of the Council had been forever<br />\nundermined by this false courtship with the<br />\ndemocratic process. The last nail on the<br />\ncoffin came later that evening when the<br />\nCouncil unwisely chose to consult the<br />\nstudent body before passing a resolution on<br />\nEl Salvador.<br />\nI know the Council's duties intimately; I<br />\nhave been running for president for the<br />\npast three years.

While the reporting of Joe Levine has been very<br />\nfair, flyers, leaflets and letters to<br />\nthe editor have succeeded in<br />\ndragging Dr. Galambos' name<br />\nthrough the mud. For this<br />\nreason we feel it is important to<br />\nraise some questions in regard to<br />\nthe public handling of the affair,<br />\nand also to present a different<br />\nperspective of Dr. Galambos<br />\nthan has been offered so far.<br />\nFrom the evidence presented, Dr. Galambos appears to be<br />\nsome type of egomaniac who<br />\ncannot deal with an employee<br />\nwho, following established procedure, went over his head for a<br />\nraise.

The<br />\npresent procedure includes four<br />\nsteps: (1) Discuss the problem<br />\nwith one's immediate supervisor<br />\n(2) Discuss it with the department head (3) Discuss it with<br />\nthe personnel office (4) Exchange letters. Step 4 ends on a<br />\nstark, even arbitrary note: \"This<br />\nis the last step in the grievance<br />\nprocedure.\" The process seems<br />\nstacked in favor of the supervisor. As the Johns Hopkins<br />\n'Employees Association put it in<br />\na letter to University personnel<br />\ndirector J. Lyon Rogers:<br />\n\"(The present grievance<br />\nprocedure) does not afford the<br />\n<br />\nemployee the opportunity to try<br />\nto come to terms with his or her<br />\nsupervisor; at no point do<br />\nthe two parties meet with a<br />\nThe<br />\nthird, objective party.<br />\ncurrent grievance procedure pits<br />\nemployees against supervisors,<br />\nwith no outside recourse, which<br />\ncould result in the former being<br />\nforced out of a job, denied of<br />\nany semblance of a fair hearing,<br />\nIn these situations, the department head often defers to<br />\npersonnel, who in turn defers to<br />\nthe department head\u2014leaving<br />\nthe employee with no answers<br />\nand no help. The person in the<br />\nlower position inevitably is going<br />\nto lose when subject to arbitrary<br />\ndecisions by the supervisor.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Mareck firing, whatever<br />\nthe merits of the case itself, will<br />\nserve to scare employees who<br />\nmay have had legitimate cornplaints away from even using<br />\nthe current grievance procedure,<br />\ninadequate as it is. Most members of the JHEA even refuse to<br />\nallow their names to appear in<br />\nprint because they fear losing<br />\ntheir jobs.<br />\nThe estab'ishment of some<br />\nkind of grievance board, coinposed of students, employees,<br />\nfaculty, and administrators,<br />\nwould be a big step towards<br />\ntreating Hopkins' office workers<br />\nmore fairly. As it is now, they<br />\nhave virtually no place to<br />\nturn.<br />\n<br />\nprove false. I can only hope that<br />\nthey will encourage \"Member\"<br />\n(as he will hereafter be called) to<br />\nsign any future slurs. I must<br />\nassume, if only from the lack of<br />\nsensitivity for women in the<br />\nletter, that \"Member\" is a<br />\nHopkins male. Being one myself,<br />\nI do not relish this particular<br />\nbrotherhood.<br />\nThe first argument, that the<br />\nstripper was actually \"exploiting\" the Hopkins men at the<br />\nparty, is a statement that could<br />\nset civil rights in this country<br />\nback at least a hundred years. If<br />\n\"magnifying (the) frustrations\"<br />\nof Hopkins men for a price is<br />\nexploitative, then a similar logic<br />\nwould uncover all sorts of nasty<br />\nvillains. Consider the povertystricken, whose acceptance of<br />\ncharity and welfare only adds to<br />\nthe guilt of the rich. Evil poor!<br />\nConsider the wicked cafeteria<br />\nThey<br />\nworkers at Hopkins.<br />\nactually take money for constantly reminding us by their<br />\nvery presence of this country's<br />\ncaste system. President Reagan<br />\ncould use these fresh new ideas<br />\nin defense of his budget.<br />\nAfter displaying such a<br />\nsensitivity for exploited Hopkins<br />\nmen, it is a shame that Member<br />\nfails, in his next paragraph, to<br />\nshow any sensitivity at all for<br />\nwomen. The \"Banana Chasing<br />\nthe Donut\" suggested something<br />\nmore than a female fear of<br />\n\"social intercourse\". As Member points out, sex should be a<br />\nA<br />\nmutually enjoyable act.<br />\nbanana forcing itself on a donut,<br />\n'however, is not mutually enjoyablt. It is rape. If it is \"Victorian\" that women should fear<br />\nrape, then maybe we have<br />\nbeen too harsh on that epoch.<br />\nIn failing to recognize the main<br />\npoint of the poster, Member<br />\nshows himself to be a fool and<br />\nperhaps a potential rapist, too.<br />\nIntercourse is \"mutually enjoyable\" only when it is mutually<br />\nagreed upon, Member, and that<br />\nis a lesson which in this \"era of<br />\nERA\" you should already have<br />\nlearned.<br />\nThis business of donuts<br />\nstriking back got Member so<br />\nupset that he found it necessary<br />\nat the end of his letter to make a<br />\npersonal attack on Ms. Rosenthal. Such a slur might have<br />\nbeen funny, but for the knowledge that 7000 copies of that<br />\nslur were printed and distributed<br />\nthroughout Baltimore. Member,<br />\nmeanwhile, like the perpetrator<br />\nof an obscene phone call, can<br />\nrest secure in the knowledge<br />\nthat his name will never be<br />\nknown. Print all the letters you<br />\ncan, Mr. Newman\u2014I do not<br />\n<br />\nREACTroNS, AND I'D LIKE To FIND OUT<br />\nwHnr you OuY5 THIN K<br />\n<br />\nEditor's Note: We have published anonymous letters since September in the hope of providing<br />\na forum for people who feel that<br />\nthey would be endangered if<br />\ntheir letters were signed.

We will continue<br />\nto publish unsigned letters.<br />\n<br />\nMangling History<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI feel compelled to write<br />\nyou a note regarding the February 20th letter of Mr. Frederick<br />\nHaydon--former professor of history (apparently Mr. Haydon<br />\nuses the word \"quondom\" instead of former to impress us or<br />\nto send us needlessly scurrying<br />\nto our dictionaries). Generally<br />\nthis man's letters are good for a<br />\nbit of comic relief and I believe<br />\nare little heeded. Now, however,<br />\n<br />\nthis \"professor\" of history has<br />\nwritten a letter badly mangling<br />\nhistory.<br />\nMr. Haydon tells us that<br />\nHenry IV's Edict of Nantes<br />\nbanished the Huguenots in<br />\nFrance (I suppose as Dr. Owen<br />\nhas banished the dogs from<br />\ncampus) and that a wise Louis<br />\nXIV revoked it (as I suppose<br />\nagain the administration would<br />\nbe wise to do to the dog ban).<br />\nAt least when Mr. Haydon is<br />\nwrong, he is really wrong. The<br />\nEdict of Nantes(as even a casual<br />\nstudent of history would know)<br />\ndid not banish the Huguenots<br />\nbut established religious toleration (albeit limited) for them in<br />\nFrance in the late 1590's. Louis<br />\nXIV did indeed revoke it (1685).<br />\nThis revocation, however, meant<br />\nrenewed religious persecution of<br />\nthe Huguenots--beginning their<br />\nmass exodus from France to<br />\nEngland.<br />\nI certainly don't mean 'to<br />\nincur Mr. Haydon's wrath by<br />\nthis or prompt yet another of his<br />\nI though,<br />\noffbeat letters.<br />\nhowever, that he might like to<br />\nbe brought up-to-date on history.<br />\nJoe Biegel<br />\n<br />\nBy Jim Gilligan<br />\n<br />\nMuller Time<br />\nHEY yOUGuYS!CAN I TALK WITH YOU FoR<br />\nDOW'AN ARTICLE<br />\nA rE NxNu TES.<br />\nFOR -THE NflvSkETTER ON SruDEN T5'<br />\nINPRESSTONS OF CONmENoRATIoN DA y.<br />\nIIEEN ON CAMP/5 ALL<br />\nNoRNING Geri-2-N'DIFFERENT REOPLES\u2022<br />\n<br />\nI only<br />\nadvocate censorship.<br />\nsuggest that libel does not<br />\nbelong in your newspaper, and<br />\nthat you will at least discourage<br />\nit if you require signed letters.<br />\nKevil Duhon<br />\n<br />\nSO TELL.

The First Birth was<br />\nsent to a human development behavioral scientist who received the book, evaluated it, suggested changes, and sent it back to the press in<br />\nOctober of 1979. Authors Doering and Entwisle<br />\nthen went over the criticisms and made several<br />\nchanges. After they had finished with it, the<br />\nrevised manuscript was sent to the Editorial<br />\nBoard.<br />\nThe Editorial Board consists of thirteen<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins faculty and Provost<br />\nRichard Longaker. The Board decides whether<br />\neach book is good enough for publication. The<br />\nBoard is divided into three committees: social<br />\nsciences, humanities, and sciences.

The paper used was the standard cream<br />\noffset paper and the book measures six by nine<br />\ninches. The production of the book took place<br />\nduring the summer of 1980. In August the<br />\nmanuscript was sent to an outside compositor<br />\nwho set the type for the book, and in September<br />\nthe Press and the author received sample pages<br />\nto get an idea of what the book would look like<br />\nin print. The setting of the type was done<br />\nin several stages, taking several months to<br />\ncomplete. Proofreading by the authors, production department, and copy editors was<br />\nperformed at each stage. After most of the<br />\ncomposition work was finished, the authors<br />\nworked on the book's index, which was completed in mid-February, 1981.<br />\nThe jacket and cover of The First Birth<br />\nwere produced in January and February of 1981,<br />\nalthough the main ideas for the jacket design<br />\nhad been conceived in advance. Originally, the<br />\nauthors had suggested a picture of a man, a<br />\nwoman, and a child for the jacket cover. Alan<br />\nCarter, who was the designer, felt that a more<br />\nmodern design involving the printed title would<br />\nbe more appropriate. \"The original idea,\" he<br />\ncommented, \"would have been dated and old<br />\nfashioned. The authors do have a large say in<br />\nthe design. We're always open to their suggestions. Often the subject matter is very specialized and we need as much help as we can get.\"<br />\nBefore the jacket design was sent to the<br />\ncompositor it was submitted to the authors for<br />\ntheir approval. \"We were very pleased with the<br />\njacket design when it was shown to us,\" said<br />\nco-author Entwisle.<br />\nThe dipsigner also has the responsibility of<br />\ndesigning the binding. Generally, if the width<br />\nof the binding is less than one inch, as was the<br />\ncase with The First Birth, the title is printed<br />\nvertically.

In addition to the standard ways in which<br />\nthe Press promotes a book, it has arranged for<br />\nthe authors to appear on television and radio<br />\nprograms as well as scheduling autographing<br />\nparties at bookstores. The promoters are concentrating on the New York and Washington<br />\nmarkets, and according to Essig, many Bookstores are placing very large orders for the book.<br />\n<br />\nTHE FUTURE OF THE UNIVERSITY PRESS<br />\nAccording to Jack Goellner the university<br />\npresses are entering a new era of cooperation.<br />\nGoellner forsees increasing cooperation among<br />\nuniversity presses in virtually all aspects of<br />\npublication except editorial.

Pottery is<br />\nits only rival.\" John Maclsaac, a graduate<br />\nstudent who assisted Romer, agrees:<br />\n\"Coins represent all aspects of classical<br />\nstudies\u2014writing, art, history, religion,<br />\npolitics. They involve you with more<br />\nthings than any other object of study.\"<br />\nIn selecting coins for the display,<br />\nwhich includes only about five percent of<br />\nthe collection, Romer had two purposes<br />\nin mind: illustrating the history of Greek<br />\nand Roman coinage and finding coins of<br />\nexceptional rarity, beauty, and historical<br />\nsignificance. According to Romer, the<br />\nearliest coins, made of a naturally occuring mixture of gold and silver, were<br />\nminted in Lydia, Asia Minor, around 700<br />\nB.C. These were stamped on one side<br />\nonly, and were soon imitated by the<br />\nGreeks, who developed the technology to<br />\nput images on both sides. Later on,<br />\nduring the Athenian \"Golden Age\" of the<br />\n<br />\n5th century B.C., the Greeks produced<br />\nsome of the tiniest coins ever minted\u2014the<br />\nobols and hemobols, which are less than a<br />\nquarter of an inch in diameter._<br />\nAmong the most beautiful coins<br />\non display are the Sicilian dekadrachmas,<br />\nor 10 drachma pieces. Perhaps the only<br />\ncoins ever to be signed by their artists,<br />\nthese show,in great detail, the symbols of<br />\nthe Sicilian city of Syracuse: the goddess<br />\nArathusa (the city's protector) and, on<br />\nthe other side, a charioteer and horses\u2014<br />\na possible reference to a military victory<br />\non the Greek mainland. Also contending<br />\nfor the aesthete's recognition are Egyptian gold pieces with meticulously engraved portraits of the rulers Ptolemy II and<br />\n<br />\nTop: Vespasian; Bottom: Judea Capta<br />\n<br />\nArsinoe II.<br />\nBut the first coins to carry the<br />\nlikeness of a living ruler Were minted<br />\nduring the reign of Alexander the Great.<br />\nAlexander's coinage, in addition to<br />\nstarting the tradition of emperors using<br />\nthe mint for self-promotion, is also<br />\nnoteworthy because specimens are found<br />\nall the way from Macedonia, north of<br />\nGreece, to the gates of India. \"This<br />\nshows us the cultural diaspora of the<br />\nGreeks which was caused by Alexander's<br />\nconquests,\" according to Romer.<br />\nBy contrast, Roman currency of<br />\nthe period was quite primitive\u2014 just<br />\nlumps of bronze with a crude picture<br />\nstamped on one side. \"It's a good indication of how backward Rome was in<br />\ncomparison to the Greeks,\" Romer says.<br />\n\"They overcame it pretty fast, though.\"<br />\nBy the time of Julius Caesar's<br />\nassassination, Roman coinage had developed into a sophisticated political instrument. \"Roman coins were tools of<br />\nsocial and political control, because they<br />\nwere the most variable public medium,\"<br />\nexplains Romer. \"You'd look at the coin<br />\nand find out what the news was.\" The<br />\nearliest examples on display are the rival<br />\ncoins issued by Octavian and Brutus after<br />\nCaesar's death. When Brutus briefly<br />\ncontrolled the mint, he put out silver<br />\npieces which celebrated the assassination<br />\nby displaying two daggers flanking the cap<br />\nof liberty, with the words \"EID MAR\"<br />\n(Ides of March) below, while Octavian<br />\n<br />\nHead of Alexander on a Thracian coin<br />\nflooded the Roman world with coins<br />\ncontaining Julius' picture and his own.<br />\nAfter he became the undisputed emperor,<br />\nOctavian, now called Augustus, justified<br />\nhis part in the civil war by issuing coins<br />\nwith the motto OB CIVIS SERVATOS<br />\n(\"because the citizens were enslaved\");<br />\nto drive home the point, he put a picture<br />\nof a crocodile chained to a palm tree on<br />\nthe other side. The same motto was also<br />\nused by the depraved Caligula and the<br />\nursurper Galba, who took over briefly<br />\nduring tbe infamous \"year of the four<br />\nemperors\" in 69 A.D.<br />\nAugustus and his successors also<br />\nused their currency to advertise conquests<br />\nand other military victories. Augustus<br />\ncelebrated the recapture of his legions'<br />\nstandards from the Parthians through the<br />\nnumismatic r<br />\n. Claudius proclaimed<br />\nhis victory ON-.<br />\nBritons, and Vespasian celebrated the suppression of the<br />\nJudean revolt, by issuing commemorative<br />\ncoins. Romer adds a bit of irony to the<br />\ncont. on p. 14<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 / FEBRUARY 27, 1981<br />\nI<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nTess Demystified<br />\ncont. from p. 13<br />\nto enter the enticing scene to spend a<br />\npleasant vacation away from winter<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nSome of the problems and mistakes are caused by the process of adapting a pre-cinema novel to the screen. A<br />\ncurrent of mystical imagery runs through<br />\nHardy's story. Tess, as a \"child of<br />\nnature,\" seems vitally in touch with the<br />\nearthy Celtic religion of her ancestors,<br />\nand equally a victim of the hypocrisy of<br />\n\"civilized\" Christianity. Polanski tries to<br />\nretain the mystical atmosphere. In the<br />\nopening scene, a procession of whitefrocked \"maidens\" waving the phallic<br />\nwillow wands celebrate the May Day.<br />\nThey break up across a meadow into<br />\nwhirling circlets of dancers, their frocks<br />\nturned to gold in the sunset. The Christlike Romantic Angel Clare, hiking past<br />\nthem, stops briefly to join the dance,just<br />\nlong enough to catch Tess' eye. Then he<br />\nwalks out of her actual life and into her<br />\nsubconscious for two years. Later, while a<br />\nleprechaunish -hobo watches, Tess kneels<br />\nto an ancient menhir to pray. And the<br />\nfilm ends at mist-shrouded Stonehenge<br />\nfor the dream-like conclusion.<br />\nBut in between these scenes, the<br />\nmythological mood is undermined. The<br />\ncrucial mystical scene in the novel is the<br />\nrape: Tess falls asleep in the misty<br />\nforest and wakes up already violated.<br />\nNaturally, this would be difficult to<br />\ndeliver visually, especially to a modern<br />\naudience who have benefited from the<br />\ndemystification of their sexuality. Polanski's solution reveals his indecision.<br />\nThe exhausted Tess alternately resists, is<br />\nseduced, and resists again until Alec<br />\nfinally has his way with her. The flacidity of their bodies as they struggle mirrors<br />\nthe flacidity of the director.<br />\nIn the novel, Alec's character<br />\ngrows more complex. After the rape<br />\nhe converts to Christianity, and his<br />\ncontinuing lust for Tess becomes an<br />\ninternal struggle between his new piety<br />\nand an older primal self. Polanski ho-<br />\n<br />\nmogenizes his character so that he is only<br />\na blend of sly lover and Snidely Whiplash.<br />\nThe novel's rich psychological<br />\ncontent, brought out through the authorial omniscience, is lost in the prolonged<br />\nshots of the actors' opaque expressions;<br />\nas a result, the psychological connections<br />\nbetween characters, and between Tess<br />\nand her world, are broken. Hardy intended all his description to be a self-conscious<br />\nprojection of Tess' interior state: \"At<br />\ntimes her whimsical fancy would intensify natural processes around her till they<br />\nseemed a part of her own story...for the<br />\nworld is only a psychological phenomenon._ The midnight airs and gusts,<br />\nmoaning amongst the tightly wrapped<br />\nbuds and bark of the winter twigs, were<br />\nformulae of bitter reproach. A wet day<br />\nwas the expression of irremediable grief.\"<br />\nWithout any assertion of psychological purpose, Polanski establishes a<br />\none-to-one relation between Tess' emotional state and the world around her:<br />\nwhen she is happy, it's sunny; when she's<br />\nsad, it's raining, etc. This appears to be<br />\nanother corny Hollywood device\u2014one<br />\nthat fell out of fashion when audiences<br />\nshowed their preference for ironic juxtaposition between a character's interior<br />\nand exterior worlds (for example, a<br />\nbeautiful day when they are miserable).<br />\nAngel Clare, an educated man,<br />\nturns out to be reading Marx's Capital, an<br />\naddition of the director's, and Polanski<br />\ndoes show, with good historical sense, the<br />\neffects of economic change\u2014the rapidity<br />\nwith which wage-labour and mechanization were displacing the traditional<br />\nfarming methods\u2014on Tess' personal life.<br />\nBut Karl Marx advised his readers to<br />\nalways look for the actual social relationships that are often hidden by the<br />\nfetishized appearance of things. Viewers<br />\nof Tess will be suitably entertained, but if<br />\nthey try to understand the dramatic<br />\ntensions underlying the lavish appearance,<br />\nthey may find that nothing substantial<br />\ncan be found\u2014unless they go back<br />\nto Hardy's novel.<br />\n<br />\nAngel Clare (Peter Firth) ponders the personal implications of Marx's Capital.<br />\n<br />\nClassical Coin Show<br />\ncont. from p. 13<br />\nexhibit by sticking the Judeans' coins<br />\nright next to Vespasian's: after all, the<br />\nJews were hardly celebrating JUDEA<br />\nCAPTA (\"Judea recaptured\") and PAX<br />\nAUGUSTA, two of Vespasian's favorite<br />\nslogans.<br />\nFinally, emperors honored members of their families by putting their<br />\nportraits on currency. As time went on,<br />\nwomen in the imperial family were more<br />\nlikely to appear on coins, suggesting their<br />\nincreased social and political visibility,<br />\naccording to Romer. One example,<br />\nparticularly interesting to gossip freaks, is<br />\nthe silver piece with Caligula's portrait on<br />\none side and those of his three sisters on<br />\nthe other; the emperor issued the coin to<br />\nquiet rumors of the perverted things he<br />\nwas doing with and to them, but its<br />\nappearance only made his subjects<br />\n<br />\nwhisper even more.<br />\nProfessor Romer and grad student<br />\nMacIsaac say this is among the few<br />\nopportunities Hopkins students will have<br />\nto see the coins, noting that the last<br />\npublic display was 10 years ago (although<br />\na very small part of the collection was<br />\nexhibited in Evergreen House until 1976).<br />\nProblems in obtaining insurance for the<br />\ncoins, which have a total value of more<br />\nthan $5 million\u2014a figure which has<br />\ntripled in the last five years\u2014have forced<br />\nthe University to store them in a bank<br />\nvault downtown, inaccessible even to<br />\nmost scholars. \"I'm the only one in the<br />\nClassics Department who had a chance to<br />\nsee them while they were downtown,\"<br />\nsays Romer.

Only one of<br />\nthe five EHL teams will sit them<br />\nout, and the Clippers' mediocre<br />\nrecord still leaves them with a<br />\ncomfortable 21-point margin<br />\nover the Hampton Aces.<br />\nAt least the squad that the<br />\nClippers will send to the playoffs<br />\nshould be stronger than any they<br />\nhave had in the past month. The<br />\nmass exodus to Oklahoma City<br />\nis finally coming to an end.<br />\nBut if the standings<br />\nremain as they are, the Clippers<br />\nwill have to open the playoffs<br />\nagainst the Blades in a best-ofseven series. To take four games<br />\nout of seven from a team that<br />\nhas lost only 11 games all year<br />\nwill be a tough assignment<br />\nindeed.<br />\nAfter a long period of<br />\nscoring drought, the Clippers<br />\ncame up with 23 goals in their<br />\nlast four games. At the same<br />\ntime, however, they have been<br />\ntoo generous at the other end,<br />\n<br />\nBut even when Baltimore<br />\nhad the ball, the team couldn't<br />\nproduce. Before the end of the<br />\nsecond half, they had a 2 on 1<br />\nsituation. Shot. Saved by goalie<br />\nAnton Toth, who was playing in<br />\n<br />\nremaining in the game. However, Washington quickly rebuilt<br />\nits lead and the Hopkins comeback was wiped out. Washington was too fast to press. In his<br />\nfinal game, Senior Mark Zielinski<br />\nhad his finest effort as a Jay,<br />\nscoring 27 points(7 of 11 from<br />\nthe field and 13 of 14 from the<br />\nfree th;pw line).<br />\nHe took<br />\nadvantage of the Washington<br />\nzone defense, popping 15-foot<br />\njumpers.<br />\nFinishing 12-12, the Jays<br />\nhad their best season since<br />\n1977-78. The past two seasons,<br />\nthe Jays posted a combined 7-38<br />\nrecord. Nevertheless, the season<br />\nhas to be considered a disappointment, since the Jays finished a poor 4-6 in the MAC<br />\nSouth.<br />\nHopkins got off to a slow<br />\n1-4 start, before winning seven<br />\nin a row. However, three of the<br />\nlosses were to non-Division III<br />\nschools (Wake Forest, Virginia<br />\nTech and Loyola), so the Jays<br />\nwere 8-1 in Division III. The<br />\nwinning streak included two<br />\ntournament championships and<br />\na big win over Ursinus (Ursinus'<br />\nonly MAC loss this season).<br />\nThe second half of the<br />\nseason was a different story.<br />\nThe Jays were unable to play<br />\n'with any consistency, losing<br />\neight of their final twelve<br />\ncontests.<br />\nUnfortunately, the<br />\nslump came at the wrong time,<br />\nas nine of the Jays' final twelve<br />\ngames were against division<br />\nrivals.<br />\nPoint guard Scott Kautz<br />\nsummed up the season, \"We<br />\nwere a lot better than the past<br />\ntwo year,\" he said. \"We proved<br />\nwe could win some games, but it<br />\nwas disappointing.<br />\nAfter an<br />\n8-4 start, I thought we were<br />\ngoing to do better. We weren't<br />\nplaying our game anymore.\"<br />\nForward Mark Zielinski<br />\nagreed, commenting, \"We beat<br />\nsome good teams like Manhat-<br />\n<br />\ntanville and St. Lawrence.\"<br />\nZielinski singled out the Jays<br />\n52-48 win at St. Mary's, January<br />\n17, as the turning point of the<br />\nseason. The Jays won that<br />\ngame, despite playing poorly. It<br />\nwas the last game of their<br />\nwinning streak. \"We became<br />\ncomplacent and couldn't get it<br />\nregenerated with any consistency,\" he explained. \"We couldn't<br />\nput it together for a whole<br />\ngame.\"<br />\nSophomore Nick Nikic led<br />\nthe team in scoring, averaging<br />\n11.5 points per game. He did<br />\nsuffer from a mid-season shooting slump, but came back with a<br />\n31-point effort against Haverford in the second to last game<br />\nof the season. He also led the<br />\nteam in rebounding and his<br />\noverall play was much improved<br />\nfrom last year.<br />\nTom Tessitore was second<br />\nin scoring, averaging 10.6 points.<br />\nHe was also second in rebounding. Tessitore was the most<br />\nconsistent Blue Jay, playing<br />\ngood defense and scoring from<br />\nthe inside and outside.<br />\nThe guard spot produced<br />\nlittle scoring for the Jays. Scott<br />\nBarr did have some outstanding<br />\ngames, taking charge in clutch<br />\nsituations. He beat Swarthmore,<br />\n63-62, with a three point play at<br />\nthe buzzer January 31. Barr<br />\naveraged 5.8 points overall and<br />\naveraged 8.3 points in the MAC.<br />\nScott Kautz led the team with<br />\n3.5 assists per game, but he<br />\nrarely shot the ball. Glenn Wall<br />\nbacked up Kautz at point guard<br />\nand he played a few good games:<br />\nhowever; he had too many<br />\nturnovers.<br />\nAll the Jays will be back<br />\nnext season except seniors Mark<br />\nZielinski and Joe Vales. Next<br />\nyear's team will be a veteran<br />\nsquad, with six seniors. With<br />\nadditional recruits, Coach Amen<br />\nwill be shooting for much more<br />\nthan a .500 record.<br />\n<br />\nBIA Billiards, Lax<br />\nPia6ue added another victory to<br />\nBY BOB STENGEL<br />\nits long list in the independent<br />\nThe BIA Season is narrowing division.<br />\ndown the field with the finale of<br />\nDue to conflicts with the<br />\nthe intramural billiards tour- schedules of the varsity teams,<br />\nnament<br />\nheld Saturday with the intramural basketball league<br />\n20 pool sharks on hand to show has had only one game date in<br />\noff their skills.

But he added<br />\nthat it was ridiculous to change<br />\nthe petition date for President<br />\nand Vice-President, since two<br />\ncandidates had already filed for<br />\neach of those positions. Wallk,<br />\nwho is one of the candidates for<br />\nPresident, charged that the petition change might be a political<br />\nploy on the part of the Elections<br />\nCommission.<br />\nThe charge seemed to divide<br />\nthe Council into two factions,<br />\none defending the Commission<br />\nand one attacking it.

The same<br />\nnight, the present Student<br />\nCouncil took over and Smith<br />\nbecame chairman of the Commission. The first thing the new<br />\nCouncil did was to decide that<br />\nthe old Council had been wrong<br />\nand immoral in validating the<br />\nelection.<br />\n\"The new Student Council<br />\ndecided that they didn't want to<br />\nupset anyone, they didn't want<br />\nto take any chances, they<br />\nweren't sure of whether they<br />\nhad the authority to reverse the<br />\ndecision of the old Council,\"<br />\nsaid Smith. \"So, at the request<br />\nof Michael Steele, I did some<br />\nresearch.

I have decided, with my running<br />\nmate Amir Halevy, to seize the Student<br />\nCouncil presidency and vice-presidency at<br />\nthis time. I will now issue a brief comment<br />\non the actions that forced us to take this<br />\nnecessary step.<br />\nAmir and I have been frustrated by the<br />\ndivisiveness that has marked Council<br />\nproceedings this year. On each of the<br />\nissues facing it\u2014the new constitution, the<br />\nSpring Fair date, and the performance of<br />\nits committees--the Council has brazenly<br />\nignored overwhelming student indifference<br />\nand has managed to fabricate several<br />\nopinions on each topic, leading to lengthy<br />\ndebate. The approach to solving problems-the recognition of two and sometimes even<br />\nmore sides to an issue--is clearly serving<br />\nonly to reinforce the Council's divisiveness.<br />\nLast week, Amir and I attempted to<br />\nmend these cracks by announcing our<br />\ncandidacy along a \"party line.\" We agreed<br />\nto work in tandem and tried to emphasize<br />\nthe beauty of this system to the students:<br />\nthere would be no further divisions of the<br />\nCouncil. A single decision would be made<br /><br />\nand stuck with. I wanted to take the<br />\npolitics out of it.<br />\nBut the old order sought, characteristically, to resist new blood. In an action<br />\nwhich was purely sour grapes, the Elections<br />\nCommission proposed extending the filing<br />\ndeadline for new candidates. The motion,<br />\nwhich was easily passed amidst the usual<br />\nbickering, could have the effect of introducing even more fragmentation and<br />\nfactionalism by widening the spectrum of<br />\ncandidates and issues.<br />\nThat did it. The final and ultimate<br />\nauthority of the Council had been forever<br />\nundermined by this false courtship with the<br />\ndemocratic process. The last nail on the<br />\ncoffin came later that evening when the<br />\nCouncil unwisely chose to consult the<br />\nstudent body before passing a resolution on<br />\nEl Salvador.<br />\nI know the Council's duties intimately; I<br />\nhave been running for president for the<br />\npast three years.

For this<br />\nreason we feel it is important to<br />\nraise some questions in regard to<br />\nthe public handling of the affair,<br />\nand also to present a different<br />\nperspective of Dr. Galambos<br />\nthan has been offered so far.<br />\nFrom the evidence presented, Dr. Galambos appears to be<br />\nsome type of egomaniac who<br />\ncannot deal with an employee<br />\nwho, following established procedure, went over his head for a<br />\nraise. Because of this, he then<br />\nsupposedly \"colluded\" and<br />\n\"conspired\" with the Personnel<br />\nDirector, Lyon Rogers, to have<br />\nMs. Mareck fired. Firstly, Dr.<br />\nGalambos did not need to<br />\nconspire to fire anyone. Supervisors are permitted to make<br />\nthese decisions on their own. He<br />\ndid not have to build a case<br />\nagainst Ms. Mareck, he merely<br />\nmade a judgement call. When<br />\nMs. Mareck appealed he was<br />\nthen contacted by Personnel<br />\n(not vice versa) to advise him of<br />\nstatus, details, etc.<br />\nDr. Galambos is not the<br />\ntype of man to harass anyone,<br />\nmuch less an employee of ten<br />\nyears. He is one of those rare<br />\nprofessors who loves to teach,<br />\nis available anytime, and is<br />\ndeeply dedicated to helping his<br />\nstudents learn and to aid them in<br />\npost-graduate life. The evidence<br />\nthat has been presented so far is<br />\nheresay and innuendo, all of it<br />\nbased on Ms. Mareck's statements.<br />\nWe call for the editors of<br />\nthis paper to request that Ms.<br /><br />\nMareck release to the public all something different to do before<br />\nwritten documents on this graduation.<br />\nClearly, the trip is available<br />\nmatter.

One wishes, though, that<br />\nMareck had accepted the offer;<br />\nafter all, a personnel officer,<br />\nfaced with the problem of<br />\nsettling such disputes in away<br />\nthat both parties can live with,<br />\ncan hardly be expected to turn<br />\ninto a white knight on horseback, heroically smiting the evil<br />\nsupervisor and saving the damsel<br />\nin distress.<br />\nHowever, the Mareck case<br />\nraises a far wider issue than the<br />\nfate of one unemployed secretary: the absence of a truly<br />\nequitable grievance procedure<br />\nfor Hopkins office workers. The<br />\npresent procedure includes four<br />\nsteps: (1) Discuss the problem<br />\nwith one's immediate supervisor<br />\n(2) Discuss it with the department head (3) Discuss it with<br />\nthe personnel office (4) Exchange letters. Step 4 ends on a<br />\nstark, even arbitrary note: \"This<br />\nis the last step in the grievance<br />\nprocedure.\" The process seems<br />\nstacked in favor of the supervisor. As the Johns Hopkins<br />\n'Employees Association put it in<br />\na letter to University personnel<br />\ndirector J. Lyon Rogers:<br />\n\"(The present grievance<br />\nprocedure) does not afford the<br /><br />\nemployee the opportunity to try<br />\nto come to terms with his or her<br />\nsupervisor; at no point do<br />\nthe two parties meet with a<br />\nThe<br />\nthird, objective party.<br />\ncurrent grievance procedure pits<br />\nemployees against supervisors,<br />\nwith no outside recourse, which<br />\ncould result in the former being<br />\nforced out of a job, denied of<br />\nany semblance of a fair hearing,<br />\nIn these situations, the department head often defers to<br />\npersonnel, who in turn defers to<br />\nthe department head\u2014leaving<br />\nthe employee with no answers<br />\nand no help. The person in the<br />\nlower position inevitably is going<br />\nto lose when subject to arbitrary<br />\ndecisions by the supervisor.\"<br /><br />\nThe Mareck firing, whatever<br />\nthe merits of the case itself, will<br />\nserve to scare employees who<br />\nmay have had legitimate cornplaints away from even using<br />\nthe current grievance procedure,<br />\ninadequate as it is. Most members of the JHEA even refuse to<br />\nallow their names to appear in<br />\nprint because they fear losing<br />\ntheir jobs.<br />\nThe estab'ishment of some<br />\nkind of grievance board, coinposed of students, employees,<br />\nfaculty, and administrators,<br />\nwould be a big step towards<br />\ntreating Hopkins' office workers<br />\nmore fairly. As it is now, they<br />\nhave virtually no place to<br />\nturn.<br /><br />\nprove false. I can only hope that<br />\nthey will encourage \"Member\"<br />\n(as he will hereafter be called) to<br />\nsign any future slurs. I must<br />\nassume, if only from the lack of<br />\nsensitivity for women in the<br />\nletter, that \"Member\" is a<br />\nHopkins male. Being one myself,<br />\nI do not relish this particular<br />\nbrotherhood.<br />\nThe first argument, that the<br />\nstripper was actually \"exploiting\" the Hopkins men at the<br />\nparty, is a statement that could<br />\nset civil rights in this country<br />\nback at least a hundred years. If<br />\n\"magnifying (the) frustrations\"<br />\nof Hopkins men for a price is<br />\nexploitative, then a similar logic<br />\nwould uncover all sorts of nasty<br />\nvillains. Consider the povertystricken, whose acceptance of<br />\ncharity and welfare only adds to<br />\nthe guilt of the rich. Evil poor!<br />\nConsider the wicked cafeteria<br />\nThey<br />\nworkers at Hopkins.<br />\nactually take money for constantly reminding us by their<br />\nvery presence of this country's<br />\ncaste system. President Reagan<br />\ncould use these fresh new ideas<br />\nin defense of his budget.<br />\nAfter displaying such a<br />\nsensitivity for exploited Hopkins<br />\nmen, it is a shame that Member<br />\nfails, in his next paragraph, to<br />\nshow any sensitivity at all for<br />\nwomen. The \"Banana Chasing<br />\nthe Donut\" suggested something<br />\nmore than a female fear of<br />\n\"social intercourse\". As Member points out, sex should be a<br />\nA<br />\nmutually enjoyable act.<br />\nbanana forcing itself on a donut,<br />\n'however, is not mutually enjoyablt. It is rape. If it is \"Victorian\" that women should fear<br />\nrape, then maybe we have<br />\nbeen too harsh on that epoch.<br />\nIn failing to recognize the main<br />\npoint of the poster, Member<br />\nshows himself to be a fool and<br />\nperhaps a potential rapist, too.<br />\nIntercourse is \"mutually enjoyable\" only when it is mutually<br />\nagreed upon, Member, and that<br />\nis a lesson which in this \"era of<br />\nERA\" you should already have<br />\nlearned.<br />\nThis business of donuts<br />\nstriking back got Member so<br />\nupset that he found it necessary<br />\nat the end of his letter to make a<br />\npersonal attack on Ms. Rosenthal. Such a slur might have<br />\nbeen funny, but for the knowledge that 7000 copies of that<br />\nslur were printed and distributed<br />\nthroughout Baltimore. Member,<br />\nmeanwhile, like the perpetrator<br />\nof an obscene phone call, can<br />\nrest secure in the knowledge<br />\nthat his name will never be<br />\nknown. Print all the letters you<br />\ncan, Mr. Newman\u2014I do not<br /><br />\nREACTroNS, AND I'D LIKE To FIND OUT<br />\nwHnr you OuY5 THIN K<br /><br />\nEditor's Note: We have published anonymous letters since September in the hope of providing<br />\na forum for people who feel that<br />\nthey would be endangered if<br />\ntheir letters were signed. Obviously this letter was a personal<br />\nattack, but in other letters, the<br />\ndistinction between whether or<br />\nnot anonymity is a mask is<br />\nnot as clear. We will continue<br />\nto publish unsigned letters.<br /><br />\nMangling History<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI feel compelled to write<br />\nyou a note regarding the February 20th letter of Mr. Frederick<br />\nHaydon--former professor of history (apparently Mr. Haydon<br />\nuses the word \"quondom\" instead of former to impress us or<br />\nto send us needlessly scurrying<br />\nto our dictionaries). Generally<br />\nthis man's letters are good for a<br />\nbit of comic relief and I believe<br />\nare little heeded. Now, however,<br /><br />\nthis \"professor\" of history has<br />\nwritten a letter badly mangling<br />\nhistory.<br />\nMr. Haydon tells us that<br />\nHenry IV's Edict of Nantes<br />\nbanished the Huguenots in<br />\nFrance (I suppose as Dr. Owen<br />\nhas banished the dogs from<br />\ncampus) and that a wise Louis<br />\nXIV revoked it (as I suppose<br />\nagain the administration would<br />\nbe wise to do to the dog ban).<br />\nAt least when Mr. Haydon is<br />\nwrong, he is really wrong. The<br />\nEdict of Nantes(as even a casual<br />\nstudent of history would know)<br />\ndid not banish the Huguenots<br />\nbut established religious toleration (albeit limited) for them in<br />\nFrance in the late 1590's. Louis<br />\nXIV did indeed revoke it (1685).<br />\nThis revocation, however, meant<br />\nrenewed religious persecution of<br />\nthe Huguenots--beginning their<br />\nmass exodus from France to<br />\nEngland.<br />\nI certainly don't mean 'to<br />\nincur Mr. Haydon's wrath by<br />\nthis or prompt yet another of his<br />\nI though,<br />\noffbeat letters.<br />\nhowever, that he might like to<br />\nbe brought up-to-date on history.<br />\nJoe Biegel<br /><br />\nBy Jim Gilligan<br /><br />\nMuller Time<br />\nHEY yOUGuYS!CAN I TALK WITH YOU FoR<br />\nDOW'AN ARTICLE<br />\nA rE NxNu TES.<br />\nFOR -THE NflvSkETTER ON SruDEN T5'<br />\nINPRESSTONS OF CONmENoRATIoN DA y.<br />\nIIEEN ON CAMP/5 ALL<br />\nNoRNING Geri-2-N'DIFFERENT REOPLES\u2022<br /><br />\nI only<br />\nadvocate censorship.<br />\nsuggest that libel does not<br />\nbelong in your newspaper, and<br />\nthat you will at least discourage<br />\nit if you require signed letters.<br />\nKevil Duhon<br /><br />\nSO TELL.

The First Birth was<br />\nsent to a human development behavioral scientist who received the book, evaluated it, suggested changes, and sent it back to the press in<br />\nOctober of 1979. Authors Doering and Entwisle<br />\nthen went over the criticisms and made several<br />\nchanges. After they had finished with it, the<br />\nrevised manuscript was sent to the Editorial<br />\nBoard.<br />\nThe Editorial Board consists of thirteen<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins faculty and Provost<br />\nRichard Longaker. The Board decides whether<br />\neach book is good enough for publication. The<br />\nBoard is divided into three committees: social<br />\nsciences, humanities, and sciences.

The First Birth was accepted by the<br />\nEditorial Board on December 7, almost six<br />\nmonths after it was originally submitted.<br /><br />\nbooks with many pictures require higher quality<br />\npaper. Sherry Olsen's book Baltimore, which<br />\ncontains 116 illustrations, uses a higher quality<br />\nand larger size paper than do most other books.<br />\nThe production department is currently working<br />\non a large book about butterflies which contains<br />\nmore than 300 illustrations and requires very<br />\nexpensive paper.<br />\nThe First Birth was produced in typical<br />\nfashion. The paper used was the standard cream<br />\noffset paper and the book measures six by nine<br />\ninches. The production of the book took place<br />\nduring the summer of 1980. In August the<br />\nmanuscript was sent to an outside compositor<br />\nwho set the type for the book, and in September<br />\nthe Press and the author received sample pages<br />\nto get an idea of what the book would look like<br />\nin print. The setting of the type was done<br />\nin several stages, taking several months to<br />\ncomplete. Proofreading by the authors, production department, and copy editors was<br />\nperformed at each stage. After most of the<br />\ncomposition work was finished, the authors<br />\nworked on the book's index, which was completed in mid-February, 1981.<br />\nThe jacket and cover of The First Birth<br />\nwere produced in January and February of 1981,<br />\nalthough the main ideas for the jacket design<br />\nhad been conceived in advance. Originally, the<br />\nauthors had suggested a picture of a man, a<br />\nwoman, and a child for the jacket cover. Alan<br />\nCarter, who was the designer, felt that a more<br />\nmodern design involving the printed title would<br />\nbe more appropriate. \"The original idea,\" he<br />\ncommented, \"would have been dated and old<br />\nfashioned. The authors do have a large say in<br />\nthe design. We're always open to their suggestions. Often the subject matter is very specialized and we need as much help as we can get.\"<br />\nBefore the jacket design was sent to the<br />\ncompositor it was submitted to the authors for<br />\ntheir approval. \"We were very pleased with the<br />\njacket design when it was shown to us,\" said<br />\nco-author Entwisle.<br />\nThe dipsigner also has the responsibility of<br />\ndesigning the binding. Generally, if the width<br />\nof the binding is less than one inch, as was the<br />\ncase with The First Birth, the title is printed<br />\nvertically.

Pottery is<br />\nits only rival.\" John Maclsaac, a graduate<br />\nstudent who assisted Romer, agrees:<br />\n\"Coins represent all aspects of classical<br />\nstudies\u2014writing, art, history, religion,<br />\npolitics. They involve you with more<br />\nthings than any other object of study.\"<br />\nIn selecting coins for the display,<br />\nwhich includes only about five percent of<br />\nthe collection, Romer had two purposes<br />\nin mind: illustrating the history of Greek<br />\nand Roman coinage and finding coins of<br />\nexceptional rarity, beauty, and historical<br />\nsignificance. According to Romer, the<br />\nearliest coins, made of a naturally occuring mixture of gold and silver, were<br />\nminted in Lydia, Asia Minor, around 700<br />\nB.C. These were stamped on one side<br />\nonly, and were soon imitated by the<br />\nGreeks, who developed the technology to<br />\nput images on both sides. Later on,<br />\nduring the Athenian \"Golden Age\" of the<br /><br />\n5th century B.C., the Greeks produced<br />\nsome of the tiniest coins ever minted\u2014the<br />\nobols and hemobols, which are less than a<br />\nquarter of an inch in diameter._<br />\nAmong the most beautiful coins<br />\non display are the Sicilian dekadrachmas,<br />\nor 10 drachma pieces. Perhaps the only<br />\ncoins ever to be signed by their artists,<br />\nthese show,in great detail, the symbols of<br />\nthe Sicilian city of Syracuse: the goddess<br />\nArathusa (the city's protector) and, on<br />\nthe other side, a charioteer and horses\u2014<br />\na possible reference to a military victory<br />\non the Greek mainland. Also contending<br />\nfor the aesthete's recognition are Egyptian gold pieces with meticulously engraved portraits of the rulers Ptolemy II and<br /><br />\nTop: Vespasian; Bottom: Judea Capta<br /><br />\nArsinoe II.<br />\nBut the first coins to carry the<br />\nlikeness of a living ruler Were minted<br />\nduring the reign of Alexander the Great.<br />\nAlexander's coinage, in addition to<br />\nstarting the tradition of emperors using<br />\nthe mint for self-promotion, is also<br />\nnoteworthy because specimens are found<br />\nall the way from Macedonia, north of<br />\nGreece, to the gates of India. \"This<br />\nshows us the cultural diaspora of the<br />\nGreeks which was caused by Alexander's<br />\nconquests,\" according to Romer.<br />\nBy contrast, Roman currency of<br />\nthe period was quite primitive\u2014 just<br />\nlumps of bronze with a crude picture<br />\nstamped on one side. \"It's a good indication of how backward Rome was in<br />\ncomparison to the Greeks,\" Romer says.<br />\n\"They overcame it pretty fast, though.\"<br />\nBy the time of Julius Caesar's<br />\nassassination, Roman coinage had developed into a sophisticated political instrument. \"Roman coins were tools of<br />\nsocial and political control, because they<br />\nwere the most variable public medium,\"<br />\nexplains Romer. \"You'd look at the coin<br />\nand find out what the news was.\" The<br />\nearliest examples on display are the rival<br />\ncoins issued by Octavian and Brutus after<br />\nCaesar's death. When Brutus briefly<br />\ncontrolled the mint, he put out silver<br />\npieces which celebrated the assassination<br />\nby displaying two daggers flanking the cap<br />\nof liberty, with the words \"EID MAR\"<br />\n(Ides of March) below, while Octavian<br /><br />\nHead of Alexander on a Thracian coin<br />\nflooded the Roman world with coins<br />\ncontaining Julius' picture and his own.<br />\nAfter he became the undisputed emperor,<br />\nOctavian, now called Augustus, justified<br />\nhis part in the civil war by issuing coins<br />\nwith the motto OB CIVIS SERVATOS<br />\n(\"because the citizens were enslaved\");<br />\nto drive home the point, he put a picture<br />\nof a crocodile chained to a palm tree on<br />\nthe other side. The same motto was also<br />\nused by the depraved Caligula and the<br />\nursurper Galba, who took over briefly<br />\nduring tbe infamous \"year of the four<br />\nemperors\" in 69 A.D.<br />\nAugustus and his successors also<br />\nused their currency to advertise conquests<br />\nand other military victories. Augustus<br />\ncelebrated the recapture of his legions'<br />\nstandards from the Parthians through the<br />\nnumismatic r<br />\n. Claudius proclaimed<br />\nhis victory ON-.<br />\nBritons, and Vespasian celebrated the suppression of the<br />\nJudean revolt, by issuing commemorative<br />\ncoins. Romer adds a bit of irony to the<br />\ncont. on p. 14<br /><br />\nPAGE 14 / FEBRUARY 27, 1981<br />\nI<br />\nI<br /><br />\nTess Demystified<br />\ncont. from p. 13<br />\nto enter the enticing scene to spend a<br />\npleasant vacation away from winter<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nSome of the problems and mistakes are caused by the process of adapting a pre-cinema novel to the screen. A<br />\ncurrent of mystical imagery runs through<br />\nHardy's story. Tess, as a \"child of<br />\nnature,\" seems vitally in touch with the<br />\nearthy Celtic religion of her ancestors,<br />\nand equally a victim of the hypocrisy of<br />\n\"civilized\" Christianity. Polanski tries to<br />\nretain the mystical atmosphere. In the<br />\nopening scene, a procession of whitefrocked \"maidens\" waving the phallic<br />\nwillow wands celebrate the May Day.<br />\nThey break up across a meadow into<br />\nwhirling circlets of dancers, their frocks<br />\nturned to gold in the sunset. The Christlike Romantic Angel Clare, hiking past<br />\nthem, stops briefly to join the dance,just<br />\nlong enough to catch Tess' eye. Then he<br />\nwalks out of her actual life and into her<br />\nsubconscious for two years. Later, while a<br />\nleprechaunish -hobo watches, Tess kneels<br />\nto an ancient menhir to pray. And the<br />\nfilm ends at mist-shrouded Stonehenge<br />\nfor the dream-like conclusion.<br />\nBut in between these scenes, the<br />\nmythological mood is undermined. The<br />\ncrucial mystical scene in the novel is the<br />\nrape: Tess falls asleep in the misty<br />\nforest and wakes up already violated.<br />\nNaturally, this would be difficult to<br />\ndeliver visually, especially to a modern<br />\naudience who have benefited from the<br />\ndemystification of their sexuality. Polanski's solution reveals his indecision.<br />\nThe exhausted Tess alternately resists, is<br />\nseduced, and resists again until Alec<br />\nfinally has his way with her. The flacidity of their bodies as they struggle mirrors<br />\nthe flacidity of the director.<br />\nIn the novel, Alec's character<br />\ngrows more complex. After the rape<br />\nhe converts to Christianity, and his<br />\ncontinuing lust for Tess becomes an<br />\ninternal struggle between his new piety<br />\nand an older primal self. Polanski ho-<br /><br />\nmogenizes his character so that he is only<br />\na blend of sly lover and Snidely Whiplash.<br />\nThe novel's rich psychological<br />\ncontent, brought out through the authorial omniscience, is lost in the prolonged<br />\nshots of the actors' opaque expressions;<br />\nas a result, the psychological connections<br />\nbetween characters, and between Tess<br />\nand her world, are broken. Hardy intended all his description to be a self-conscious<br />\nprojection of Tess' interior state: \"At<br />\ntimes her whimsical fancy would intensify natural processes around her till they<br />\nseemed a part of her own story...for the<br />\nworld is only a psychological phenomenon._ The midnight airs and gusts,<br />\nmoaning amongst the tightly wrapped<br />\nbuds and bark of the winter twigs, were<br />\nformulae of bitter reproach. A wet day<br />\nwas the expression of irremediable grief.\"<br />\nWithout any assertion of psychological purpose, Polanski establishes a<br />\none-to-one relation between Tess' emotional state and the world around her:<br />\nwhen she is happy, it's sunny; when she's<br />\nsad, it's raining, etc. This appears to be<br />\nanother corny Hollywood device\u2014one<br />\nthat fell out of fashion when audiences<br />\nshowed their preference for ironic juxtaposition between a character's interior<br />\nand exterior worlds (for example, a<br />\nbeautiful day when they are miserable).<br />\nAngel Clare, an educated man,<br />\nturns out to be reading Marx's Capital, an<br />\naddition of the director's, and Polanski<br />\ndoes show, with good historical sense, the<br />\neffects of economic change\u2014the rapidity<br />\nwith which wage-labour and mechanization were displacing the traditional<br />\nfarming methods\u2014on Tess' personal life.<br />\nBut Karl Marx advised his readers to<br />\nalways look for the actual social relationships that are often hidden by the<br />\nfetishized appearance of things. Viewers<br />\nof Tess will be suitably entertained, but if<br />\nthey try to understand the dramatic<br />\ntensions underlying the lavish appearance,<br />\nthey may find that nothing substantial<br />\ncan be found\u2014unless they go back<br />\nto Hardy's novel.<br /><br />\nAngel Clare (Peter Firth) ponders the personal implications of Marx's Capital.<br /><br />\nClassical Coin Show<br />\ncont. from p. 13<br />\nexhibit by sticking the Judeans' coins<br />\nright next to Vespasian's: after all, the<br />\nJews were hardly celebrating JUDEA<br />\nCAPTA (\"Judea recaptured\") and PAX<br />\nAUGUSTA, two of Vespasian's favorite<br />\nslogans.<br />\nFinally, emperors honored members of their families by putting their<br />\nportraits on currency. As time went on,<br />\nwomen in the imperial family were more<br />\nlikely to appear on coins, suggesting their<br />\nincreased social and political visibility,<br />\naccording to Romer. One example,<br />\nparticularly interesting to gossip freaks, is<br />\nthe silver piece with Caligula's portrait on<br />\none side and those of his three sisters on<br />\nthe other; the emperor issued the coin to<br />\nquiet rumors of the perverted things he<br />\nwas doing with and to them, but its<br />\nappearance only made his subjects<br /><br />\nwhisper even more.<br />\nProfessor Romer and grad student<br />\nMacIsaac say this is among the few<br />\nopportunities Hopkins students will have<br />\nto see the coins, noting that the last<br />\npublic display was 10 years ago (although<br />\na very small part of the collection was<br />\nexhibited in Evergreen House until 1976).<br />\nProblems in obtaining insurance for the<br />\ncoins, which have a total value of more<br />\nthan $5 million\u2014a figure which has<br />\ntripled in the last five years\u2014have forced<br />\nthe University to store them in a bank<br />\nvault downtown, inaccessible even to<br />\nmost scholars. \"I'm the only one in the<br />\nClassics Department who had a chance to<br />\nsee them while they were downtown,\"<br />\nsays Romer.

Only one of<br />\nthe five EHL teams will sit them<br />\nout, and the Clippers' mediocre<br />\nrecord still leaves them with a<br />\ncomfortable 21-point margin<br />\nover the Hampton Aces.<br />\nAt least the squad that the<br />\nClippers will send to the playoffs<br />\nshould be stronger than any they<br />\nhave had in the past month. The<br />\nmass exodus to Oklahoma City<br />\nis finally coming to an end.<br />\nBut if the standings<br />\nremain as they are, the Clippers<br />\nwill have to open the playoffs<br />\nagainst the Blades in a best-ofseven series. To take four games<br />\nout of seven from a team that<br />\nhas lost only 11 games all year<br />\nwill be a tough assignment<br />\nindeed.<br />\nAfter a long period of<br />\nscoring drought, the Clippers<br />\ncame up with 23 goals in their<br />\nlast four games. At the same<br />\ntime, however, they have been<br />\ntoo generous at the other end,<br /><br />\nBut even when Baltimore<br />\nhad the ball, the team couldn't<br />\nproduce. Before the end of the<br />\nsecond half, they had a 2 on 1<br />\nsituation. Shot. Saved by goalie<br />\nAnton Toth, who was playing in<br /><br />\nremaining in the game. However, Washington quickly rebuilt<br />\nits lead and the Hopkins comeback was wiped out. Washington was too fast to press. In his<br />\nfinal game, Senior Mark Zielinski<br />\nhad his finest effort as a Jay,<br />\nscoring 27 points(7 of 11 from<br />\nthe field and 13 of 14 from the<br />\nfree th;pw line).<br />\nHe took<br />\nadvantage of the Washington<br />\nzone defense, popping 15-foot<br />\njumpers.<br />\nFinishing 12-12, the Jays<br />\nhad their best season since<br />\n1977-78. The past two seasons,<br />\nthe Jays posted a combined 7-38<br />\nrecord. Nevertheless, the season<br />\nhas to be considered a disappointment, since the Jays finished a poor 4-6 in the MAC<br />\nSouth.<br />\nHopkins got off to a slow<br />\n1-4 start, before winning seven<br />\nin a row. However, three of the<br />\nlosses were to non-Division III<br />\nschools (Wake Forest, Virginia<br />\nTech and Loyola), so the Jays<br />\nwere 8-1 in Division III. The<br />\nwinning streak included two<br />\ntournament championships and<br />\na big win over Ursinus (Ursinus'<br />\nonly MAC loss this season).<br />\nThe second half of the<br />\nseason was a different story.<br />\nThe Jays were unable to play<br />\n'with any consistency, losing<br />\neight of their final twelve<br />\ncontests.<br />\nUnfortunately, the<br />\nslump came at the wrong time,<br />\nas nine of the Jays' final twelve<br />\ngames were against division<br />\nrivals.<br />\nPoint guard Scott Kautz<br />\nsummed up the season, \"We<br />\nwere a lot better than the past<br />\ntwo year,\" he said. \"We proved<br />\nwe could win some games, but it<br />\nwas disappointing.<br />\nAfter an<br />\n8-4 start, I thought we were<br />\ngoing to do better. We weren't<br />\nplaying our game anymore.\"<br />\nForward Mark Zielinski<br />\nagreed, commenting, \"We beat<br />\nsome good teams like Manhat-<br /><br />\ntanville and St. Lawrence.\"<br />\nZielinski singled out the Jays<br />\n52-48 win at St. Mary's, January<br />\n17, as the turning point of the<br />\nseason. The Jays won that<br />\ngame, despite playing poorly. It<br />\nwas the last game of their<br />\nwinning streak. \"We became<br />\ncomplacent and couldn't get it<br />\nregenerated with any consistency,\" he explained. \"We couldn't<br />\nput it together for a whole<br />\ngame.\"<br />\nSophomore Nick Nikic led<br />\nthe team in scoring, averaging<br />\n11.5 points per game. He did<br />\nsuffer from a mid-season shooting slump, but came back with a<br />\n31-point effort against Haverford in the second to last game<br />\nof the season. He also led the<br />\nteam in rebounding and his<br />\noverall play was much improved<br />\nfrom last year.<br />\nTom Tessitore was second<br />\nin scoring, averaging 10.6 points.<br />\nHe was also second in rebounding. Tessitore was the most<br />\nconsistent Blue Jay, playing<br />\ngood defense and scoring from<br />\nthe inside and outside.<br />\nThe guard spot produced<br />\nlittle scoring for the Jays. Scott<br />\nBarr did have some outstanding<br />\ngames, taking charge in clutch<br />\nsituations. He beat Swarthmore,<br />\n63-62, with a three point play at<br />\nthe buzzer January 31. Barr<br />\naveraged 5.8 points overall and<br />\naveraged 8.3 points in the MAC.<br />\nScott Kautz led the team with<br />\n3.5 assists per game, but he<br />\nrarely shot the ball. Glenn Wall<br />\nbacked up Kautz at point guard<br />\nand he played a few good games:<br />\nhowever; he had too many<br />\nturnovers.<br />\nAll the Jays will be back<br />\nnext season except seniors Mark<br />\nZielinski and Joe Vales.
