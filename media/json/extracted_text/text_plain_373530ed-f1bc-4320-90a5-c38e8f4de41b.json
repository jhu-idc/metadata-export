The Athletic Center<br />\nhas proposed one semester of required phys<br />\ned for freshmen, consisting of two hours a<br />\nweek for a single credit. The program<br />\nclaims the laudable goal of seeking to instill<br />\nin students a general appreciation for<br />\nregular exercise, and of providing a basic<br />\ninstruction in first aid and nutrition.<br />\nDean Hooker has outlined three<br />\nimportant questions in regard to the<br />\nproposal which will suffice for our consideration of it here; is it necessary, should it<br />\nbe offered for credit, and should it be<br />\ncompulsory?<br />\nYes, some sort of increased orientation towards exercise is necessary. Most of<br />\nthe bodies here are screaming for physical<br />\nactivity of. any sort. The average existence<br />\nhere is cyclical, and works as follows: up<br />\nat the crack of noon after a solid four<br />\nhours, down a few bowls of nutritious<br />\nBanana Whackies, run to class clutching<br />\nsavaged intestines, collapse into a seat in<br />\nthe back row, and fall asleep. After class,<br />\nperk up with a few Toblerones in Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop, and onward until the final<br />\nstumble out of the Hut at four a.m.<br />\nThe problem with the Athletic<br />\nCenter's proposal in regard to the above<br />\nregimen is that it won't make a dent. Two<br />\nhours a week, even if it were enough to<br />\nplant the seed of appreciation for regular<br />\nexercise, is far too little to get anyone<br />\nthinking and planning with an eye towards<br />\nphysical exertion. Most students would<br />\nprobably tank up on Toblerones anyway<br />\nand come in late for those two hours a<br />\nweek. If the program is to avoid being like<br />\nso many other obligatory courses for the<br />\nnon-participant, something like an hour<br />\neach day of the week would be a lot more<br />\nvaluable.<br />\nBut then of course, you have the<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\nStart Here, Duck<br />\n<br />\nDana G illian<br />\n<br />\nTo The Editor:<br />\n<br />\nNo Dope Media<br />\nBY MICHAEL LORTON<br />\nI objected, quite strenuously, to the inclusion of the<br />\n\"Outside World\" article on drug<br />\nat Homewood. Although not a<br />\ndirect encouragement to break<br />\nthe law, it struck me as an<br />\negregious contribution to the<br />\natmosphere of indifference to<br />\nthe law that is the most serious<br />\nailment of our society.<br />\nI am not against drug abuse<br />\njust because it is stupid 0,<br />\ndangerous; many legal things are<br />\none or both. However, right<br />\nnow, in this country, it is illegal<br />\nto use or possess certain substances. That is the law.<br />\nTrue enough, the law is<br />\nbroken, almost continually.<br />\nFrom the same point of view,<br />\nthere is a murder in this country<br />\nevery half-hour, and that is in no<br />\nsense a nullification of that law.<br />\n<br />\nThe laws of the United States<br />\nexist; they can be changed, and<br />\nin this case, probably should be.<br />\nNonetheless, laws are the line<br />\nbetween chaos and peace for a<br />\ncivilization.<br />\nAs an institution, especially<br />\nas a newspaper, the News-Letter<br />\nhas an obligation, if not to<br />\nuphold the law, then to show at<br />\nleast a salutory respect for it.<br />\nPrinting an article that reads like<br />\na restaurant review, giving helpful hints on the ingestion of<br />\nvarious illegal chemicals, is not<br />\neven violating the law; it is<br />\nridiculing it.<br />\nThe article itself seems to be<br />\npoking fun at something. When<br />\na drug \u2014 even one likened to 5<br />\ncups of coffee<br />\nis noted as<br />\ncausing \"hallucinations, paranoia<br />\nand mild schizophrenia,\" the<br />\nwarning that it should be taken<br />\ncont. on p. 7<br />\n<br />\nproblem of time and incentive. In answer<br />\nto Dean Hooker's second question, yes,<br />\ncredit should definitely be offered for phyr.,<br />\ned. One credit, however, is not enough.<br />\nTrue, it's enough for two hours a week, but<br />\nfor a serious program of phys ed, three<br />\ncredits would be more in order. If exercise<br />\nis going to be offered (and, more to the<br />\npoint, if its going to be imposed) as a<br />\ncourse, it should be credited as one.<br />\nBut mandatory phys ed?<br />\nIn answer to Dean Hooker's third<br />\nquestion, the program should not be<br />\nmandatory. Freshman year is enough like<br />\nthe crude old days at sleep-away camp that<br />\nno one should have to go in the pool when<br />\nhe doesn'ti want (an actual feature of this<br />\nproposal: all non-swimmers must learn to<br />\nswim). Being an adult means being able to<br />\ndo certain things when and if you feel like<br />\nit. Besides, if the University's interest is in<br />\nmaking us all into well-rounded human<br />\nbeings (well, maybe not so round), then it<br />\nhas some revising to do in the rest of the<br />\ncurriculum. Most majors here concentrate<br />\nextensively in a single area\u2014it's what most<br />\nstudents come to Hopkins to do. If they'd<br />\nwanted to be Renaissance men, they would<br />\nhave gone to some place with a core<br />\ncurriculum. While there are some basic<br />\nlanguage and science requirements here,<br />\nthese are a waste of time for many, because<br />\nthey can be easily gotten around. And<br />\nbesides, there's no time to do them meaningfully, anyway.<br />\nIf the University wants to take a<br />\nmore<br />\nholistic approach to education<br />\n(which is a fine idea), it should do it right,<br />\nand make exercise both feasible and<br />\nmeaningful while at the same time allowing<br />\nstudents to choose for themselves as adults.<br />\nAn hour a day for three credits would offer<br />\nthe time and the incentive needed to lure<br />\nmost students out of their flabby stupor;<br />\nthe few that chose to remain in it would be<br />\nexercising their right to do so.<br />\n<br />\nThere's only one thing in<br />\nthe world that's better than an<br />\nEggo frozen waffle covered with<br />\nBosco\u2014a good controversy. You<br />\nknow, this school year has been<br />\nreally good as far as controversies go. I mean, we probably<br />\ncould have had a few more, but<br />\nthe ones we had were pretty<br />\ngood. Do you know what I<br />\nmean? Well, this is just to thank<br />\nyou for the super terrific job<br />\nyou've done covering the year's<br />\nexciting issues as well as producing your own when there was a<br />\nlull in the action (although I did<br />\nthink that George Yatchinsin<br />\ndeserved a cover photo for his<br />\nsemi-resignation).<br />\nWell, just in case this Ron<br />\nPeppe vs. HOP-GOP thing doesn't pan out the way it should, or<br />\nif the Robin Johnson vs. Greece<br />\nissue wears out, or if plus/minus<br />\ngrading suddenly collapses/dies,<br />\nI thought I'd send a list of a<br />\nfew more keen controversies<br />\nthat could be stirred up. Feel<br />\nfree to use any of them.<br />\nI. How about if the admin-<br />\n<br />\nistration tried to bring socialism duates into university housing<br />\nto JHU? There could be some by doubling up rooms without<br />\nswell debates as to whether or doing likewise to the grad<br />\nnot socialism should apply only student population or without<br />\nto incoming freshmen.

The issue<br />\nwas raised in the News-Letter in<br />\nRobin Johnson's Opinion article<br />\non fraternity rush 2 weeks ago<br />\nand was discussed in letters by<br />\nDavid Hurwitz and David Bellinger last week.<br />\nI have no first-hand information about the \"stripper parties\" or raffles involving prostitution which Ms. Johnson mentioned. But I read no denials<br />\nlast week that they have occurred.<br />\nIn much of our society, the<br />\nblatant oppression and degradation of women remains more<br />\nsocially acceptable than does<br />\novert racism. But I see no great<br />\ndifference in the principle between them.<br />\nMr. Hurwitz<br />\noffered his opinion that such<br />\nactivities offer \"genuine fun,\"<br />\nand are \"incredibly healthy,\"<br />\nand so on. Whether he meant all<br />\nthis seriously or not, I fear that<br />\nhis comments reflect a popular<br />\nattitude. Would he also defend<br />\nsimilar practices built on racism<br />\nrather than sexism?<br />\nIf people attempt to achieve<br />\nsome sense of camaraderie (as<br />\nMr. Bellinger suggests) through<br />\nactivities involving the abuse of<br />\nthemselves (e.g., heavy alcohol<br />\nconsumption) and of others, it is<br />\na tragedy for them as well as<br />\nfor anyone they victimize in the<br />\nprocess.<br />\nCertainly problems like sexism and alcohol abuse are deeply<br />\nrooted in this society. They are<br />\nnot unique to the campus. But<br />\nwe do have to deal with'them<br />\nand their consequences here. I<br />\nthink that Ms. Johnson was<br />\nquite correct to raise these<br />\nissues.<br />\nI was also struck by the<br />\narticle in the last News-Letter by<br />\nthe woman who discussed her<br />\nexperience as a victim of rape.<br />\nShe concluded that she would<br />\nnot want to live if she were<br />\nraped again. This tragedy seems<br />\nto me related to the other<br />\nproblem. It reminded me of an<br />\nincident in which a friend of<br />\nmine, then an undergraduate<br />\n(not at JHU), was raped by an<br />\nacquaintance of hers. I don't<br />\nbelieve that he was what we<br />\nusually call psychopathic. But<br />\nhe was quite drunk at the time.<br />\nI think that, to the extent that<br />\nwe accept certain kinds of sexist'<br />\nor racist behavior as having \"a<br />\ngood time,\" we help perpetuate<br />\na social environment which leads<br />\nto such violence.<br />\nI believe that it is possible<br />\nfor people to develop meaningful, lasting friendships and a<br />\npositive sense of belonging to a<br />\ngroup\u2014and even to have lots of<br />\nfun\u2014without abusing themselves<br />\nor others. I think that that is<br />\nworth striving for. And I think<br />\nthat anyone who opposes any<br />\nsexist or racist or other such<br />\nexploitative and dehumanizing<br />\nactivities on this campus or<br />\nanywhere is absolutely right to<br />\nchallenge them.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nRobert A. Seidel.<br />\n<br />\nMorality:LowReturn<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe main point that the<br />\nInvestment Morality<br />\nPublic<br />\nCommittee seems to miss in its<br />\nletter (\"A Moral Investment,\"<br />\nN-L, Feb. 12) is that Hopkins<br />\ndoes not invest its money in<br />\ncorporations to support their<br />\npublic policies, but rather to<br />\nreceive a profitable return on its<br />\ninvestment funds. The PIMC is<br />\nalarmed because \"these funds<br />\ncan potentially find their way<br />\ninto corporations such as Nestle<br />\nor others who might develop<br />\nnuclear weaponry or have<br />\ndealings in South Africa. Thus,<br />\nHopkins could be directly<br />\nsupporting corporations whose<br />\npolicies don't adhere to the<br />\nprevaling morality.\" My question is, whose morality is the<br />\nprevailing one? Not all of us<br />\nthink that nuclear weaponry is<br />\ninherently immoral. And one<br />\nhas only to look back to the<br />\nMcCarthy monkey business of<br />\nthe 50's to realize that the<br />\nprevailing morality can be mass<br />\nhysteria at its worst and just<br />\nmass confusion at its best. It is<br />\nalso quite inaccurate to say that<br />\nHopkins is directly supporting<br />\nthese corporations: we would<br />\nnot make such investments if the<br />\ncorporations were not supporting us, at least in part.<br />\nHighly moral and compassionate businesses do not<br />\ngenerally rake in large enough<br />\nprofits to be of interest to a<br />\nuniversity like Hopkins. Perhaps<br />\ninvesting in Mother Theresa's<br />\norphanage could soothe some<br />\nconcerned consciences, but the<br />\ndifference in, funds would eventually show up as a tuition hike<br />\nthat would come out of everyone's pocket, even the committee members'. Such financial<br />\nstraits could also result in the<br />\ndisbanding of of superfluous<br />\nstudent groups like the PIMC.<br />\nHopkins' main purpose is academic, not political, despite<br />\nwhat certain groups of the<br />\nStudent Council believe. They<br />\nshould consider that many of<br />\ntheir fellow students seek to be<br />\nhired by immoral profit-driven<br />\nexecutives of large corporations<br />\nlike IBM or Sperry upon graduation. What are big businesses<br />\nconcerned with the opinion of<br />\nHopkins' student body,anyway?<br />\nThe Board of Trustees is not an<br />\nimmoral body itself, and can<br />\nbetter express the Hopkins<br />\nopinion in the role of shareholder.<br />\nLeave the watchdogging to<br />\nthe Justice Department and the<br />\nFDA.

Hashish, which is a<br />\nconcentrated form of THC,<br />\ncomes in three colors: blond,<br />\nbrown, and black. Around here,<br />\nit's usually blond at $5-7 a gram,<br />\nbut there hasn't been much for a<br />\nwhile.<br />\nHash is fun, because there<br />\nare several ways of smoking it.<br />\nBesides the conventional methods of smoking pot, you can also<br />\nsmoke hash under a glass on the<br />\nend of a pin, or mixed with<br />\ntobacco in a cigarette (the<br />\nEuropean method).<br />\nThe real drawback of hash,<br />\nwhich is much more apparent<br />\nthan with marijuana, is the fact<br />\nthat it has a very high tar level,<br />\nwhich, with extended use, can<br />\nproduce a hacking cough, and<br />\nincrease your susceptibility to<br />\nchest colds. So take it easy<br />\nwith the 'shish. Don't smoke it<br />\n\u2022 too many days in a row, or you<br />\nmay have to give it up altogether<br />\nfor a while. Also, there is a danger with marijuana (unheard of<br />\non this campus to my knowledge) that the original plant has<br />\nbeen treated with insect herbicides which can cause serious<br />\nillness. It may have also been<br />\ntreated with PCP or \"angel<br />\ndust,\" which can cause brain<br />\n<br />\ndamage. These substances cannot be detected prior to use.<br />\nMarijuana and hashish also<br />\nhave therapeutic value. According to Goodman and Gilman's<br />\nThe Pharmacological Basis of<br />\nTherapeutics (sixth edition,<br />\nMacMillan, copyright 1980),<br />\nTHC counteracts nausea which<br />\nis a side-effect of chemotherapy<br />\nand also relieves the pain involved in chemotherapy because<br />\nof its analgesic qualities.

Says the letter, \"The<br />\nEducation Committee flatly opposes assigning graduate students<br />\nto teach courses where they<br />\ncannot attend every lecture.\"<br />\nThe letter goes on to assert<br />\nthat another concern of students<br />\nhere is the \"discrepancy in<br />\ngrading policies among the<br />\nteaching assistants within each<br />\ncourse.\" To amend this problem, the Committee urges \"consultation among teaching assistants to standardize grading policies for each course.\"<br />\nA third and final charge<br />\nmade by the Education Committee's letter is that the greatest<br />\nconcern of students was \"the<br />\ndisregard displayed by some<br />\nteaching assistants for their<br />\nestablished office hours.\" The<br />\nletter concludes that \"such disregard prevents students from<br />\nobtaining assistance with course<br />\nwork.\"<br />\nThe letter that was approved by the Committee is the<br />\nresult of several weeks' drafting<br />\nand redrafting by that Committee.

Walker<br />\nDepartment ofPhysics<br />\nN-L: Do you believe<br />\nthere is grade inflation<br />\nat Hopkins?<br />\nWalker: I don't know<br />\nwhat you mean by<br />\ngrade inflation. Do you<br />\nmean that in recent<br />\nyears the percentage of<br />\nstudents getting higher<br />\ngrades has increased?<br />\nN-L: More B's proportionally than A's or C's,<br />\naccording to the Bell-shaped curve.<br />\nWalker: If you define it that way, yes. I think there is<br />\ngrade inflation at Hopkins. I think it is right to have<br />\nmore than a simple answer. In the case of my physics<br />\ncourse, I gave the largest number of A's that I've ever<br />\ngiven in this past semester's course. The reason is that I<br />\ndon't grade on a curve, I grade on an absolute scale<br />\nbased on my experience, and a very large number of<br />\nstudents did a very good job. I gave harder exams than<br />\nI've given in several years and the students did better on<br />\nthem. If that's grade inflation, then so be it. I think the<br />\nstudents learned more and I'm not particularly alarmed<br />\nby it.<br />\nN-L: Do you think there is grade inflation, in your<br />\ndepartment?<br />\nWalker: I think that students are making higher grades<br />\nthan they used to and in some cases it is because they<br />\nhave a heightened interest in preparing a record for some<br />\npre-professional training; they think their grades are<br />\nmore important than students in the past, and they are<br />\nworking harder. That's my experience, it may not be in<br />\ngeneral true in the department, and that kind of grade<br />\ninflation I'm not worried about\u2014if students do well the<br />\ngrades should reflect it.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel students in your department have to<br />\nwork harder for an A than students in another department?<br />\nWalker: I don't know. Those of us in the physics<br />\ndepartment feel physics students are generally made to<br />\nwork harder. Students in my course say they spend a lot<br />\nof time. How well they do in other departments, I can't<br />\nbe sure; I think that physics students have to work.<br />\nN-L: Do you believe that plus/minus grading will<br />\ncontribute to or alleviate grade inflation?<br />\nWalker: I don't think it will alleviate grade inflation,<br />\nand since I was one of the proponents of it, I hope that<br />\nit won't contribute to grade inflation. I think that in the<br />\nshort term it might; I think that a feeling of there being<br />\nmore gradations might, in the beginning, cause students<br />\nto worry more about their gradations. I hope that once<br />\nthings settle down, this won't be the case. I think that<br />\nstudents who from the beginning are accustomed trplus/minus grades, and that's all they know,the effect i..<br />\nsmaller. This is one of the reasons why I'm happy that<br />\nthe University will implement grades only for the new<br />\nstudents. Students who have been accustomed to the<br />\nold scheme will not have plus/minus grading in their<br />\ncareers. My basic feeling is plus/minus grading will<br />\nprobably be neutral, with regard to competition;competition starts in the minds of the student. My course is<br />\ntaught so that students aren't working against each<br />\nother, they are working against my standards in the<br />\ncourse. So, if everyone makes an A,everyone gets an A.<br />\nIf everyone makes an F, everyone gets an. F.

Back in the dark'<br />\nages, when I came here,<br />\nthe average was a little<br />\nover 2.0.<br />\nN-L: What caused the<br />\nchange?<br />\nGryder: A number of<br />\nthings. One of them is<br />\ntrivial, but I think it<br />\nhad an effect, and that's the invention of keeping<br />\nrecords on IBM machines. Before the advent of IBM.<br />\nmachines, if you dropped a course, some secretary<br />\nhad to erase your record of taking the course. For the<br />\nsecretary, it was much easier to type \"withdrew.\" When<br />\nrecords started to be kept on computers, it was easy to<br />\neliminate all record of having been in a course. So,<br />\nthis and late drop dates has caused only people who are<br />\ndoing well to stay in courses. Actually, in my mind,that<br />\nisn't really grade inflation. It's just a waste of a student's time to spend half a semester in a course and then<br />\ndrop it. As to other factors, on the graduate level,<br />\ndepartments started putting in a requirement that you<br />\nhad to have a B average to be in good standing. So C's<br />\nwere regarded as F's or D's. I think some of that carried<br />\nover to the undergraduate level. Professional schools<br />\nwanted higher grades. It's unfortunate that grade<br />\ninflation exists, because it makes it harder for the<br />\nstudent to really know the extent to which he has a<br />\nknowledge of the subject.<br />\nN-L: Do you think plus/minus grading will have an<br />\neffect on grade inflation?<br />\nGryder: No. It may cause the GPAs to go up a little bit<br />\nbecause some professors will use pluses and not minuses.<br />\nN-L: How do you grade?<br />\nGryder: I try to decrease the direct competition. I tell<br />\nmy class in advance that a certain numerical grade will<br />\ncorrespond to a certain letter grade. I don't do it by a<br />\ndistribution, but I try to make up the examination so a<br />\ncertain numerical score will be the median. At the same<br />\ntime, I don't want a huge variation from one semester to<br />\nanother, so as the year goes on, I try to adjust how the<br />\n<br />\nN-L: Do you believe that plus/minus grading will<br />\ncontribute to or alleviate grade inflation?<br />\nChrist: I don't think it will make any real difference.<br />\nAs far as cut-throatedness of students with regard to<br />\ngrades under a plus/minus system, I don't really know<br />\nwhat the effect would be. . .probably a larger number<br />\nwould care about individual grades, but they would each<br />\ncare less. Over the long run in the present system, the<br />\ndifference between one letter grade and the next lowest<br />\nletter grade alters the GPA .for the entire transcript by<br />\nabout one-third of one per cent in a single course. Also,<br />\nunder plus/minus the probability of ten course grades all<br />\ngoing the same direction away from the straight letter<br />\ngrade for a single student is one in 1024.

I think I should set the<br />\ngrading procedure I want, and tell the class what I'm<br />\ngoing to do, and if they don't like it, they can tell me or<br />\nthey can not take the course. I think I'd rather have<br />\nthe instructor set the grading policy. I want to stress,<br />\nthough, that we don't have good feedback, we don't<br />\nknow what our colleagues are doing. The course guide<br />\nshould include more questions on grading procedures.<br />\nN-L: Do you think there is grade inflation in your own<br />\ndepartment?<br />\nCone: I think relatively little in my own department.<br />\nThose are the grades I'm a little more aware of. That's<br />\ngot to be weighted by my own grades, I'm more aware<br />\nof my own grades. For me if there was a point of grade<br />\ninflation in my own past, I think I was more generous<br />\nwith the curve somewhere in the late sixties and early<br />\nseventies. At that point I decided that rather than have<br />\nA's be some very super special grade, and have D's and<br />\nthe whole range, that I'd confine myself mostly to A's,<br />\nB's and C's, and I also feel that if I'm going to have to<br />\nmake discriminations like that, I'm going to make the<br />\ncuts where it makes the most discrimination, and that<br />\nturns out to be in the mid parts of the bell-shaped curve,<br />\nand not out at the wings. It's easy to say people way<br />\nout at either end get A's and D's; it's hard to decide in<br />\nthe middle part. I'm aware that a lot of courses get<br />\ngraded lots of B's and not many A's, not many<br />\nC's\u2014that's the easy part of the sketch for me, 'cause<br />\nyou're out in the wings. I decided that if we're going to<br />\nhave grades at all we ought to make the cuts where it<br />\nmatters more, and that means to come further in. So I<br />\ndecided almost a decade ago to go a third, a third, and a<br />\nthird: one-third A's, one-third B's, and one-third C's. I<br />\nknow that when the final grades are finished, I ease off a<br />\nbit. It ends up with more B's and fewer A's and C's.<br />\nBut my first cut is a third, a third, and a third. That's<br />\nwhat I tell all my classes, but then I become generous.<br />\n<br />\nCone: Thank you for asking that question. The whole<br />\nquestion of grade inflation came clear to me as soon as I<br />\ngave peer grading because most students were fearful<br />\nthat their peers would grade them down. Obviously it<br />\nwould be in your best interest to screw your classmates<br />\nso you get a better grade. So everybody is worried<br />\nabout their classmates grading them down. Instead what<br />\nhappens is (if you think that professors have inflated the<br />\ngrades) I have found that in peer grades, if I ask students<br />\nto give A's, B's, and C's, most of the students got A-'s or<br />\nB+'s. Not only grade inflation, so that there are more<br />\nA's, but all of the papers are clustered around A-/B+.<br />\nAlso I asked them to do it in terms of numbers, not<br />\ngrades. The averages came out to be between 87 and 92,<br />\nabout 90% of the grades between 85 and 93. Students<br />\nwere (nobody was willing to grade anybody down) all<br />\nclustered right around 90. What I do now is to have<br />\nstudents rank order papers. I arrange it so that each<br />\npaper is not rank ordered by a small set of numbers, but<br />\nordered against a large number. Each paper is rank<br />\nordered against 40 papers, so student's don't have to<br />\ncomplain that \"I gave you an A and you gave me a C\";<br />\nthey rank order them. And the papers get evaluated<br />\ncompared with a large body of papers. Going back to<br />\nobjectivity, one of the things that happens when you<br />\nread a lot of papers, is think how this compared with the<br />\nlast paper I read, or the last few I read. So the way I had<br />\nit work out is each paper is read to be compared with a<br />\nlarge number of papers. I also think that adds to the<br />\nobjectivity.<br />\n<br />\nRon Walters<br />\n<br />\nCone: I think it's the most objective method of giving a<br />\ngrade that I know of. Short of having.. .that is, grading<br />\non the basis of written work rather than problem sets.<br />\nThe problem when grading a paper, a person's writing,<br />\nit's hard to quantify it. What I decided to do was to<br />\nhave each paper read by many readers and to have the<br />\nauthors anonymous. I find that when I grade papers<br />\nwritten by students that I know, it is very hard for me<br />\nnot to put into that grade some sense of what I think<br />\nabout that student's overall performance. So, I feel like<br />\nI'm more objective when I read papers among others.<br />\nSecond, I think that any piece of writing is likely to ring<br />\nbells, negative or positive, with a particular reader, so<br />\nthat any particular reader's judgment is going to veer one<br />\nway or the other, so it's fairer in judging a writer, if you're<br />\nfinally going to have to give a grade, to have many<br />\npeople read one paper and for them all to read it anonymously. So, that's what I chose to do in my course.<br />\nAnd the other part of that is that I ask the student to<br />\nwrite papers for their peers, for their peers as the audience, not for the expert in the field. Writing for the<br />\nexpert in the field is easy because the expert will always<br />\nunderstand what you're trying to say. Writing for your<br />\npeers requires really understanding the material and<br />\npresenting it clearly. So it's much more demanding an<br />\nassignment to write for your peers than to write for a<br />\nprofessor. So I have them do that 'cause I think learning<br />\nhow to write well is a very important skill, because it<br />\ninvolves thinking through and understanding what<br />\nyou're writing about. That's why I have peers do the<br />\nevaluation. I assign peers to read, and have peers evalu-<br />\n<br />\nDepartment of History<br />\nN-L: Do you believe there is grade inflation at Hopkins?<br />\nWalters: I think there is grade inflation everywhere.

I don't think Hopkins is very far<br />\noff the norm for colleges and universities of its type.<br />\nN-L: Is it (grade inflation) in your department (History)?<br />\nWalters: I think it's probably everywhere. Grades in my<br />\ndepartment and other departments look higher to me<br />\nthan grades looked when I was an undergraduate. To<br />\nsome extent, that's not a fair comparison because I went<br />\nto Stanford, which at the time I went there was an A<br />\ncurve. Unfortunately, for instance, a 3.5 grade point<br />\naverage at Stanford was good enough to make Phi Beta<br />\nKappa in the junior year. I don't think it's good enough<br />\nto make Phi Beta Kappa in the junior year here at<br />\nHopkins, and I feel much of that's a product of the<br />\n1960's and the kind of educational changes that were<br />\naround.<br />\nNews-Letter News-Letter News-Letter News-Letter<br />\n<br />\nN-L: Explain your own grading system.<br />\nWalters: I don't like grading; I like reading papers, I like<br />\ncommenting on papers. My grading, I guess the best way<br />\nto talk about it in the survey course, with the teaching<br />\nassistants. What we do is talk about what constitutes<br />\nan A, what constitutes a C, a D, and failure is very<br />\nobvious. We assume that for an A,a person has to show<br />\na fairly good mastery of the material and some spark of<br />\noriginality, some evidence of critical thinking, the ability<br />\nto synthesize material. A B, again some mastery of the<br />\nmaterial, less originality or maybe less consistency. A B<br />\nmay have a good idea but not be able to defend its<br />\norigin quite right. A C, we figure, is either just consistently mediocre, or more likely, a person that doesn't<br />\nknow something that he should have known. A D<br />\ncontains factual errors, errors in logic or interpretation.<br />\nAn F is worse. Now within those general categories,<br />\nthere are people that fall in-between. There are always a<br />\nfew people each year who are very, very difficult to deal<br />\nwith. Someone whose ideas are just as good but they<br />\njust manage to screw up so thoroughly or there are<br />\npeople who just work so hard and improve so much and<br />\nwho aren't quite there. . . And it's always a problem<br />\nwhether to kick them up a notch or give them what we<br />\nthink is the real level of performance. I think plus/<br />\nminus grading helps a little bit. . . In terms of grading<br />\nstandards, in the survey course, where I don't do all the<br />\ngrading, teaching assistants do pass papers around among<br />\nthemselves. We sit down and pass papers around among<br />\nall of us and then I spot check papers. I pull papers out<br />\nof the pile without either the student or the TA.knowing, and look to try to ascertain whether the papers with<br />\nthe same grade are roughly comparable. . . I'm sure<br />\nthere are exceptions to that. I'm less troubled by what I<br />\nthink are erratic grading standards than I'm troubled by<br />\ninequities within the present grading system. I know the<br />\nstudent objections to plus/minus grading and I think<br />\nthat we were unjust in hearing them, but I also think<br />\nthat when we were under the plus/minus grading system<br />\nhad a move been made to go to the Hopkins system,<br />\nthere would have been outrage and open rebellion,<br />\nbecause we regarded the plus/minus system as a safeguard. . . I remember missing an A by 1 point in a<br />\nfreshman biology course, graded on a curve. My fury<br />\nwas less getting a B+ under the plus/minus system than it<br />\nwould have been getting a B under the present system.<br />\nThe difference was between 33 and 3.7 in that case<br />\nwhere it would have been between 3 and 4 here. My<br />\nfeeling about the conversion to plus/minus grading is<br />\nthat maybe there wasn't enough discussion. I think<br />\nstudents perceived it as kind of a faculty plot. Perhaps<br />\nwe didn't get serious enough student concerns about<br />\nplus/minus. But you have to separate procedural problems from the sytem itself.

What it will<br />\nhelp do, I think, is distinguish a little better, levels of<br />\nperformance. . . I agree that there is always a certain<br />\namount of arbitrariness. I think there will never be a<br />\nperfect system. I think it will help make it a little more<br />\nclear where a person falls in relation to his classmates.<br />\nThe overall inflation will persist, but at least it will help<br />\nsort out relative standing.<br />\n<br />\nN-L: One question specific to your grading policy. In a<br />\npeer graded system, do you find that students are less<br />\nlikely to give C's because they don't want to get C's?<br />\n<br />\nN-L: Do you believe that plus/minus grading will<br />\ncontribute to or alleviate grade inflation?<br />\nCone: I think that it will hardly affect it. When I have<br />\ngiven pluses and minuses, that is listed pluses and minuses on the bulletin board. What I find is that all those<br />\nthat got pluses come in and argue vigorously to have<br />\ntheir grade raised. So if it has any effect at all, I'd say it<br />\nwould increase grade inflation because it would increase<br />\nthe vigor with which the people who got pluses will<br />\nattempt to get their grade revised.<br />\n<br />\nN-L: So, do you think plus/minus grading will alleviate<br />\ngrade inflation?<br />\n<br />\nate.

It's not as easy as it<br />\nsounds: after years of watching Nicholson mug his way through countless \"Just<br />\ncall me Badass\" movies, it's hard to tell<br />\nwhether his ever-arching eyebrows and<br />\nkiller grin are deliberate undermining<br />\ninfluences or just reflex actions. In The<br />\nBorder, the eyes are hidden most of the<br />\ntime behind aviator shades and the smile<br />\nappears only rarely, but it's still hard to<br />\ntake him seriously. It's not entirely his<br />\nfault, though \u2014 he's the prisoner of a bad<br />\nscreenplay.<br />\nNicholson plays Charlie Smith, a<br />\nrestless Immigration and Naturalization<br />\nofficial from California who, along with<br />\nhis upwardly mobile middle-class wife<br />\nMarcy (Valerie Perrine), moves from<br />\na Los Angeles trailer park to a ranch<br />\nhouse in El Paso, Texas, and takes a job<br />\nas a patrolman on the Mexican border.<br />\nWhen he's not busy shuttling potential<br />\nillegal aliens back across the Rio Grande<br />\nor getting angry at Marcy for running up<br />\nbills, he's halfheartedly socializing with<br />\nthe other guards and their wives, almost<br />\nall of whom are depicted as sleazy hicks.<br />\n<br />\nMeanwhile, he continues to search for<br />\n\"something to make me feel good some<br />\ntime,\" though he can't quite put a finger<br />\non what that might be.<br />\nSet up as a counterpoint to<br />\nNicholson's low-key altruism on the job<br />\nare a number of guards, including Charlie's redneck neighbor Cat(Harvey Keitel)<br />\nand the police captain (Warren Oates),<br />\nwho traffic in the \"wets\" as cheap labor<br />\nfor local farms and businesses. The<br />\nsituation makes for an interesting paradox: the underpaid guards have a responsibility to keep the Mexicans out of<br />\nthe country, yet in order to make enough<br />\nmoney to support their families they<br />\nillow many to pass \"unnoticed,\" and in<br />\n-act round most of them up on the U.S.<br />\nale and hand-deliver them to their<br />\nprospective employers. One of the major<br />\n<br />\n\"Shit!\" says Nicholson, while mashing hand and gnashing teeth.<br />\n<br />\nweaknesses of the film, however, is tndt<br />\nthe paradox is never satisfactorily explored; the workings of the system are<br />\nleft mostly to the imagination.<br />\nInstead, the movie turns to Maria<br />\n:Elpidia Carillo), a young Mexican<br />\nwoman with a newborn baby, who in her<br />\nrepeated attempts to cross the border is<br />\ncontinually crossing paths with Charlie.<br />\n<br />\nAnd Charlie, for no apparent reason,<br />\nbegins to sympathize with her. Again,<br />\nthe writers (Deric Washburn, Walon<br />\n3reen, and David Freeman) have miscalmlated badly by never fully explaining<br />\nhe nature of the relationship between<br />\n.2harlie<br />\nand Maria: it could be sexual,<br />\nilthough most of the evidence in the film<br />\ngoes against that; it could be paternalistic<br />\n(Charlie and Marcy are childless). Any<br />\nnumber of speculations could be made,<br />\nbut unfortunately none of them are<br />\nsupported by the screenplay. The best<br />\nexplanation seems to be that Maria<br />\nbecomes Charlie's \"moral center,\" just<br />\nthe thing he needs to save him from his<br />\nsuburban anomie and the corruptive<br />\ninfluences of his fellow workers; still, the<br />\nreasons for this are never made clear.<br />\nOnce more the story shifts focus<br />\nwhen it should be delving more deeply<br />\ninto the questions it's raising. When<br />\nMaria's baby is stolen by the black<br />\nmarket (with the tacit consent of the<br />\nborder police), and Charlie takes it upon!<br />\nhimself to rescue the child, the plot lapses<br />\ninto a good guys/bad guys morality play<br />\nfrom which it is never able to extricate<br />\nitself. One begins to wonder, despite all<br />\nthe fascinating issues the film raises (not<br />\nthe least among them being the mystery<br />\nof Charlie's psychological makeup), if the<br />\nfilmmakers really had no higher ambition<br />\nthan to create a sort of Tex-Mex Dirty<br />\nHarry.<br />\nThe director, Tony Richardson<br />\n(Tom Jones, The Loneliness of the Long<br />\nDistance Runner), in conjunction with<br />\ncinematographers Ric Waite and Vilmos<br />\nZsigmond, has painted a harsh, sleazy<br />\nportrait of both the geography and the<br />\ninhabitants of the area so realistically that<br />\nthe glaring white sun and the grime on<br />\npeople's faces almost become characters<br />\nin themselves; the acting throughout<br />\nranges from good to excellent; and Ry<br />\nCooder's eerie, mystical score perfectly<br />\ncrossbreeds Mexican exoticism with menacing Texas rock rhythms. But, for all its<br />\ntexture, The Border is ultimately a<br />\n.;ornball melodrama.

If you get bored seeing<br />\none man standing at a table for two and a<br />\nhalf hours, Emlyn Williams as Charles<br />\nDickens As the worst of evenings.<br />\nAttending the show presently at the<br />\nMechanic is like being at a feast where<br />\nthe sole food offered is caviar. If you like<br />\ncaviar, you're in for a treat. If not, well<br />\n...time to stay home and break out the<br />\nfrosted flakes.<br />\nEmlyn Williams, whose only props<br />\nfor the two-and-a-half-hour performance<br />\nare a small table and five volumes of<br />\nDickens, gives an excellent rendition of<br />\neach of the nine scenes on the program.<br />\nWilliams appears to be authentic Dickens:<br />\nhis snowy hair is brushed back from his<br />\nwell worn face, he sports a mustache, and<br />\nwears a thin, silky beard that hangs from<br />\nhis chin like a dolphin's tail.<br />\nWilliams does the show entirely<br />\nwithout scripts, despite cursory references to the volumes at hand.

Dickens' imagery is marvelous, but at times the limitations of a<br />\none-man show surpass the quality of the<br />\nscript: the concentration required is<br />\ngreat, as words, not actions are the<br />\ncaptors of attention. Without physical<br />\nreinforcements, if attention slips at all,<br />\nthe impact of the lines, and thus the<br />\nstory, is lost.<br />\nThe scenes themselves are told<br />\nfrom different Dickensian viewpoints,<br />\nincluding excerpts from The Pickwick<br />\nPapers, Dombey and Sons, A Tale of Two<br />\nCities, and others. Williams does the first<br />\nscene, \"Moving in Society,\" in a dry,<br />\nslightly sardonic tone that makes the<br />\nhumor wry. The second scene is perhaps<br />\nslightly more interesting because it is<br />\nnarrated by a character, forcing Williams<br />\nto play more of a role than that of the<br />\nauthor. The narrative voice continues to<br />\nchange from scene to scene, but Williams<br />\nremains consistently in fine form.<br />\nThe real weakness (and it is a<br />\nweakness common to all solo performances) of Emlyn Williams as Charles<br />\nDickens becomes apparent around the<br />\nfifth scene. The realization that this is<br />\nvery much like those before it, and will<br />\nprobably be the same as those following<br />\nafter it.<br />\nAlthough internally (within<br />\neach scene) there is a rise, climax, and fall<br />\nof action, externally (throughout the<br />\nperformance) there is virtually no change.<br />\nThis lack of dramatic escalation can lead<br />\nto the fidgets, unless you have carefully<br />\nprepared yourself for a static evening of<br />\nCharles Dickens readings.<br />\nThe raison d'etre behind-the solo<br />\nperformance of Emlyn Williams is pointed out in varying ways several different<br />\ntimes during the evening. First of all,<br />\nDickens used to read his own works in<br />\nperformance as a kind of \"second ca-<br />\n<br />\nreer.\" Then, in the tourtn scene, a<br />\ncharacter discusses the \"fashion of<br />\nimmortality,\" and this is illustrated when,<br />\nat the end of the 20th century, Williams<br />\nperpetuates something that was written<br />\nin the 19th century. Next, Dickens<br />\nhimself (and incidentally<br />\njustifies<br />\nWilliams) as a solo performer when<br />\nWiliams quotes something about ladies<br />\nand gentlemen who get their living out of<br />\nthe public. Then, in his very Versatile<br />\nvoice, Williams gives vent to a small,<br />\nmeaningful chuckle.<br />\nThe essence of Williams' reason<br />\nfor his performance, however, is illustrated at the very end of the evening,<br />\nwhen, after bowing several times to the<br />\naudience, Williams turns and bows to the<br />\nvolumes of Dickens. This, then, becomes<br />\nthe final analysis\u2014Emlyn Williams as<br />\nCharles Dickens is a tribute. Dickens was<br />\na great writer, and Williams is a great<br />\nperformer.

As director of The<br />\nLast Metro, Truffaut once again proves<br />\nthat he is a serious artist who can offer a<br />\nprofound and distinct vision of reality.<br />\nA period piece, The Last Metro is<br />\nset in occupied France during World War<br />\nII. Its position in time requires that the<br />\nsubject of politics be broached, something that Truffaut avoids in most of his<br />\nfilms. Nevertheless, it is deftly done<br />\n<br />\nwithout relying on an artillery of antiNazi propaganda.

The avantgarde split into two factions: the punks<br />\nwent for a jarring electric guitar sound,<br />\nwhile the more esoteric pursued art-rock's<br />\nlatest incarnation, the New Romantics,<br />\nand layers of synthesizer. Even former<br />\npop bastions of the acoustic guitar, those<br />\nchampioning the \"wimp\" sound (read<br />\nJackson Browne, the Eagles, et al.),<br />\nentered a tentative world of electrical<br />\ninstruments. Some may go as far to say<br />\nthat it was all downhill for acoustics since<br />\nthe Newport Folk Festival of 1965 when<br />\nBob Dylan betrayed us all.

In<br />\nDivision IIB, DU has outmatched everyone with a record<br />\nof 5 wins and no defeats. Sig Ep<br />\nalso shows an unblemished<br />\nrecord with 3 wins but Team<br />\nOrient, more commonly known<br />\nas the Orient Express,'is coming<br />\non strong with a record of four<br />\nWins and one defeat.

The women played a<br />\npoor game despite high scores by<br />\nRichards with 19 and Klauber<br />\nwith 17 points. Following in<br />\ntheir own footsteps, Tyler<br />\nfouled out and Klauber found<br />\nherself on the bench with 4<br />\nfouls. Buchanan led the rebounding with 13.<br />\nHopkins finally took the<br />\ninitiative and controlled the<br />\nattack against Marymount on<br />\nFeb. 13. The Jays won 58-46<br />\nand the key to victory was even<br />\nscoring by the entire varsity<br />\nsquad. Klauber and Richards<br />\nplayed excellent games and the<br />\nwomen executed clean fast<br />\nbreaks. Less experienced players<br />\nsaw much court time.<br />\n<br />\nThe old foul nemesis returned on Feb. 16 as St. Mary's<br />\nbeat Hopkins 67-58. Klauber<br />\nfouled out and Buchanan<br />\ngathered four fouls. Coach Kay<br />\nFowler (no pun intended) described Hopkins' defense as<br />\n\"flat\" and noted missed baskets<br />\nand turnovers on the break as<br />\ncontributing to the loss. St.<br />\nMary's awesome point guard<br />\nscored 20 points off the Jays'<br />\nweak defense. Dawn Richards<br />\nplayed a nice game and lead in<br />\nboth scoring (15) and rebounding (19!).<br />\nHopkins was invited to<br />\nparticipate in a weekend-long<br />\ntournament beginning tonight at<br />\nCatholic U.

Part of the<br />\nreason for this year's tough<br />\nschedule has been the superior<br />\nperformance of past Hopkins<br />\nteams.<br />\nGreen describes it as,<br />\nsimply, the schedule being<br />\ntougher than the team's ability.<br />\nHe mentions that the top<br />\nexperienced fencers just have<br />\nnot been here this year, and he is<br />\nhoping to use this season so that<br />\nthe younger fencers can gain the<br />\n<br />\nLady Jay parries opponent.<br />\n<br />\nA Small Leap For Mankind<br />\nBY STEVEN EISENBERG<br />\nIt was about twelve years<br />\nago when we got rid of the black<br />\nI<br />\nand white in the den.<br />\nshouldn't say that we got rid of<br />\nit; we just moved it downstairs<br />\nand got rid of the tube job. But<br />\nwe didn't get rid of that either;<br />\nwe gave it to Grandma because<br />\nshe had just gotten rid of her<br />\ntransistor portable.<br />\nDad didn't want another<br />\nblack and white. He always<br />\nthought it wasn't realistic, that<br />\nwe were missing what was really<br />\nhappening and most of all what<br />\ncolors were actually being<br />\nflashed on the screen. A color<br />\nTV was the only answer, so Dad<br />\nbought one from one of his<br />\nchildhood friends who sold us<br />\nthe refrigerator the year before<br />\nwhich my mother's sister-in-law<br />\nnow has, but that's a different<br />\nstory with a very similar ending.<br />\nDad brought home the set<br />\nin time for the first landing on<br />\nthe moon. Not one kid at camp<br />\nthat afternoon cared about scoring the winning run or making<br />\nthe game-ending catch. All they<br />\nwanted to do was to home<br />\nand watch Neil Armstrong make<br />\nhis historic step. It was as if<br />\nthey changed from glory-hungry<br />\nurchins to an army of cherubs<br />\nwaiting to board the buses for<br />\nthe voyage home.<br />\nThe ride to the home front<br />\nwas like any other trip home.<br />\nThe twins were fighting; one was<br />\na boy and the other a girl, but<br />\nthe girl was bigger and everyone<br />\nthought she was older than her<br />\nsmaller brother; she was by<br />\nabout three minutes although<br />\nEric didn't care.<br />\nAnd then there was the boy<br />\nwho traded and gave away<br />\nbaseball cards; he told everyone<br />\nthat he stole them, but his<br />\nmother told my Mom that his<br />\ncousin worked for Topps. Mom<br />\ncalled up Rich's mother because<br />\none day I brought home 978<br />\ncards, and she wanted to know<br />\nwhere I had gotten them. She<br />\nthreatened not to give me<br />\n<br />\nallowance that week so I decided<br />\nto tell her because Series Seven<br />\nwas coming out in two weeks,<br />\nand Rich wouldn't be able to<br />\ngive me any; his cousin moved to<br />\nCalifornia, or at least that's what<br />\nRich said.<br />\nThe four of us used to sit in<br />\nthe back of the bus, but we were<br />\nsix in all: two sisters sat up<br />\nfront because they liked the bus<br />\ndriver and hated us. We sang<br />\nsongs and played games while<br />\nthe girls talked about nail<br />\npolish and dieting. The funny<br />\nthing about it was that the driver<br />\nwas hysterically pregnant although I'm sure I was mistaken.<br />\nThe two girls, if you want to call<br />\nthem girls, looked as if their<br />\nmouths met head-on earlier<br />\nin their infancies.<br />\n<br />\nThen there was Tom, whom<br />\nI saw Mondays, Tuesdays, and<br />\nThursdays. He wasn't on the<br />\nbus that afternoon, but I wish he<br />\nwere. He didn't talk much but<br />\nyou could always talk to him<br />\nabout anything. Once I wanted<br />\nto send a letter to the New York<br />\nYankees asking for a team<br />\npicture, autographs and a roster<br />\nand I didn't know what to do.<br />\nBut Tom did, and I was able to<br />\nwrite to every team in the NFL<br />\nafter writing to the Yankees and<br />\nthe Mets.<br />\n<br />\nfor the landing. It was scheduled for late afternoon.<br />\nAt 6:25 a special report<br />\ncame on. It was time. The lunar<br />\nmodule landed and Neil Armstrong was about to come out.<br />\nDad stopped with his jokes, and<br />\nmy sister stopped laughing.<br />\nMom came in from the kitchen<br />\nand raised the volume; she<br />\nalways did.<br />\nArmstrong stepped on the<br />\nWe<br />\nThen Aldrin.<br />\nmoon.<br />\nwatched the live pictures until<br />\nMom shut off the set because<br />\ndinner was ready.<br />\nAfter dinner the Rangers<br />\nand the Canadiens were on TV.<br />\nI walked into the den where Dad<br />\nwas reading the Times. He said<br />\nit was all right if I watched the<br />\ngame with him.<br />\nTwo minutes into the first<br />\nperiod a fight broke out between<br />\nRod Gilbert and Larry Robinson. They went at it for about<br />\nthree minutes before the referees<br />\nbroke it up.<br />\nDad put down his paper and<br />\ngot up to adjust the color. But<br />\nit wasn't color anymore; it was<br />\nblack and white. I didn't want<br />\nto argue with Dad, so I tried<br />\nwatching the game like I had<br />\nwatched every other game before that day, but I couldn't.<br />\n<br />\nSo I went downstairs to<br />\nlisten to the stereo but it wasn't<br />\nthere. I think we gave it to<br />\nDad's sister.<br />\nI came back upstairs to the<br />\nden.<br />\n\"Dad, I'm going next door.\"<br />\n\"Have a good time,son, and<br />\ncome home early. You have<br />\nRich was the first one to get camp tomorrow.\"<br />\noff the bus, although Tom<br />\nusually was. The two sisters<br />\nI went next door and<br />\nwere next, then the twins, and watched the game with John and<br />\nthen me. Before I got off I his father. But the only colors<br />\ntalked to Sue about the historic on the screen were black and<br />\nmoment. She didn't seem too white. I was going to ask John<br />\nhappy about it. Maybe that's about the set but decided not to.<br />\nwhy she pushed me off the bus.<br />\nMom opened the door for<br />\nIt was a good thing that<br />\nme, and we quickly walked into tomorrow was Thursday. Tom<br />\nthe den where the rest of the would know what to do. His<br />\nfamily was watching TV, waiting family didn't have a TV.<br />\n<br />\nexperience necessary for coming<br />\nyears. He believes that next year<br />\nthe team will improve drastically<br />\nand is hoping for a much more<br />\nsuccessful season.<br />\nIn women's college fencing,<br />\nthere is only one weapon, the<br />\nfoil. It is a light, flexible weapon, the use of which requires<br />\nspeed and strategy. Four fencers<br />\nfrom one team face four others<br />\nin a round-robin format. Green,<br />\nin trying to provide all team<br />\nmembers with experience, has<br />\nbeen alternating the fencers.<br />\nSharynne George, a junior, and<br />\nAudrey Tsao, a senior, lead the<br />\nteam as co-captains. Jackie<br />\nWong, Loretta Sprissler, juniors,<br />\nand Diana Newman,Chris Jones,<br />\nsophomores, have also been<br />\nseeing plenty of action this year.<br />\nOf these, only two fencers were<br />\nin varsity last year, with<br />\nSharynne George the only one<br />\nwith the distinction of having<br />\nbefore<br />\nexperience<br />\nfencing<br />\nattending Hopkins. Last Friday,<br />\nFeb. 12, the Blue Jays lost to<br />\nNavy, 14-2, the same score as in<br />\ntheir losses to Stevens and<br />\nDuke. Their loss to Farleigh<br />\nDickinson at Teaneck was by a<br />\nscore of 13-3.<br />\nThis is the first year that<br />\n<br />\n' women's college fencing has<br />\nbeen included in the NCAA.<br />\nThere will be a national tournament at San Jose State the last<br />\nweek of March. The Regionals<br />\nwill be held at UNC-Chapel Hill<br />\non March 6. The Blue Jays will<br />\nbe participating in the tournament. The fencing team has not<br />\nhad a match against any team in<br />\nits regional division, and there is<br />\nno standard by which one can<br />\npredict their performance in the<br />\ntournament.<br />\nA bright spot this season has<br />\nbeen the enthusiasm of the<br />\nfreshman class. There are 16 ,<br />\nfreshmen on junior varsity this<br />\nyear, making it one of the largest<br />\never in Hopkins history. Green<br />\nis very excited about women's<br />\nfencing here, as he believes that<br />\nthe studerit response has been<br />\nsteadily increasing. The girls are<br />\ninexperienced, but willing to<br />\nwork, and he mentions that as a<br />\ncoach he finds the atmosphere<br />\nvery enthusiastic. He believes<br />\nthe girls should be admired for<br />\nsticking to the program this far,<br />\nnot only because of their dismal<br />\nrecord, but also because, of the<br />\nthirty fencers on varsity and<br />\njunior varsity, only four can<br />\nfence at each match.<br />\n<br />\nSwimmersDefeatedBy<br />\nTough Terrapin Squads<br />\nBY JAY SCHNEIDER<br />\nThe University of Maryland<br />\nswim team holds the honor of<br />\nbeing the first and only team to<br />\ndefeat Johns Hopkins by a wide<br />\nmargin. Maryland is a member<br />\nof the ACC and is faster than<br />\nmany Division I teams.<br />\nThe match was closer than<br />\nthe score indicated. The Blue<br />\nJays performed normally, which<br />\ntranslates to swimming very fast,<br />\nbut Maryland was too much for<br />\nthem. The men lost by a score<br />\nof 75-34, but fared better than<br />\nthe women, who were overwhelmed, 111-35. Coach Tim<br />\nWelsh admitted that the women<br />\nare \"not yet at a level to compete with a top level Division I<br />\nteam like Maryland.\"<br />\nLast week the women competed in the Maryland AIAW<br />\nfinals, held every year at Towson<br />\n<br />\nState. Welsh described the meet<br />\nas a \"low-key championship<br />\nmeet,\" that is, as far as Hopkins<br />\nis concerned, a \"dress rehearsal<br />\nfor the MACs.\" The Blue Jays<br />\ncame in fifth out of nine teams<br />\nparticipating. There are many<br />\nmore women's swimming teams<br />\nit Maryland colleges than that,<br />\n)ut some schools only enter the<br />\nNCAA finals. Hence the description \"low-key championship<br />\nmeet.\"<br />\nThere is only one more<br />\nmeet before the MAC finals<br />\ncome to the Athletic Center on<br />\nFeb. 25. The women's team will<br />\nface George Washington University, a Division II team, tonight<br />\nat G.W.

A proposal calling<br />\nfor a mandatory physical education program will be discussed<br />\nand voted upon by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies at<br />\ntheir March 4 meeting. If the<br />\ncommittee accepts the proposal,<br />\nthen the Academic Council will<br />\ndecide whether to implement<br />\nthe program.<br />\nThe proposal drawn up by<br />\nthe Department of Physical<br />\nEducation and Athletics calls for<br />\n12 weeks of classes, with one<br />\ntwo-hour class each week. One<br />\ncredit would be given for the<br />\ncourse. All freshmen,excerdt for<br />\nthose on a varsity team or those<br />\nexcused by the Health Service,<br />\nwould be required to participate.<br /><br />\nThe proposal cites four<br />\npurposes of the course: to<br />\npromote an understanding of the<br />\nnature and value of physical<br />\nexercise as a basis for lifetime<br />\nactivity; to provide instruction<br />\nin areas of personal health, diet,<br />\nnutrition, first aid, and the<br />\ntreatment of injuries; to improve<br />\nperformance in a limited number<br />\nof physical activities and lifetime<br />\nsports; and to provide an introduction to the JHU Athletic<br />\nCenter.<br />\nThe program would include<br />\na lecture series, sports activity<br />\nsession, and fitness/conditioning<br />\nsessions. In addition, a swimming test would be given and all<br />\nthose who dig not pass the test<br />\nwould be required to take<br />\nswimming instruction.<br />\nIntroductory lectures would<br />\ncover the effects of weight<br />\ntraining, running, and swimming<br /><br />\nBA-MD Program May Be Phased Out<br />\nweeks \"the Committee on Education Policy and Curriculum<br />\nwill begin the first stages of<br />\nreview,\" and then will make<br />\ntheir recommendation \"to the<br />\nnext medical school Academic<br />\nCouncil meeting.\"<br /><br />\nBY ROBERT INSOFT<br />\nAccording to some Hopkins<br />\nmedical students, plans are now<br />\nbeing made to phase out the<br />\nUniversity's Human Biology<br />\nBA.-M.D. program. However,<br />\nadministration officials are still,<br />\nnot commenting on any details<br />\nof this proposal.<br />\nThe B.A.-M.D. track of the<br />\nHuman Biology Program integrates a liberal arts education<br />\nwith the normal medical school<br />\ncurriculum. However, B.A.-M.D.<br />\nstudents complete both their<br />\nundergraduate<br />\nand<br />\nmedical<br />\nschool degree requirements in<br />\nseven years, compared to the<br />\nusual eight. Each year between<br />\n15 and 25 highly qualified<br />\nstudents\u2014mainly college sophomores\u2014are accepted into this<br />\naccelerated program from Hopkins and a number of other<br />\nundergraduate institutions.<br />\nAfter having replaced the<br />\nso-called \"2-5\" medical program<br />\nback in 1977, the B.A.-M.D.<br />\nprogram was intended to attract<br />\nqualified students wanting to<br />\nbecome doctors, but at the same<br />\ntime were still desiring an<br />\neducation in the humanities and<br />\nsocial sciences.<br />\nAccording to Hopkins B.A.M.D. student Carol Wilson, there<br />\nhas been some discussion among<br />\nmedical school officials and<br />\nstudents concerning the future<br />\nof this program.<br />\nShe had<br />\nlearned that the small applicant<br />\npool and lack of publicity as<br />\ncompared to the four-year progam, as well as the proposed<br />\ncancellation of grants from the<br />\nprogram's major sponsor, the<br />\nCommonwealth<br />\nFoundation,<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins School of Medicine<br />\nmay have prompted the present accelerated medical education<br />\nreview.<br />\nprograms.<br />\nThe Commonwealth FounThe Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\ndation is a non-profit organiza- School's Dean of Academic<br />\ntion, which for the past few Affairs, Jack Yardley, would not<br />\ndecades has been funding medi- disclose any details behind the<br />\ncal school education. A reassessment of their priorities has led present examination of the B.A.them to invest more money into M.D. program. However, he did<br />\nhealth care delivery, instead of say that within the next few<br /><br />\nMany Human Biology students have already expressed<br />\ntheir dismay over any plans to<br />\ncancel the program, including<br />\nWilson, who will regret Hopkins'<br />\nlosing \"such a great educational<br />\nopportunity.\"<br />\nIf the B.A.-M.D. program<br />\nwas to be phased out, Yardley<br />\nexplained, it would not be<br />\nimmediate; plans would still be<br />\nmade to enroll at least the<br />\ncurrent class of applicants. No<br />\nother Univerrsity Human Biology programs, such .as the<br />\nprograms in Public Health,<br />\nwould be affected.<br /><br />\nOther<br />\non physical fitness.<br />\nlectures would include personal<br />\nhealth, emergency first aid,<br />\ntreatment of injuries, and nutrition and diet.<br />\nThe sports activity sessions<br />\nwould include raquetball, laThe<br />\ncrosse, and volleyball.<br />\nsessions<br />\nfitness/conditioning<br />\nwould include weight training,<br />\nswimming,and running.<br />\nThe physical education staff<br />\nwould summarize and evaluate<br />\nthe program during the final<br />\nclass. This class would also be<br />\nused to present a design for a<br />\npersonal self-conditioning program.<br />\nThe proposal recommends<br />\nthat the grading be done on a<br />\nSatisfactory<br />\npass/fail basis.<br />\ncompletion of the course would<br />\nbe dependent upon improvement in ability and skills, and on<br />\nattendance. Up to two absences<br />\nwould be allowed.<br />\nAlthough this is the first<br />\ntime that a proposal of this<br />\nnature has come before the CUS,<br />\nthe idea has been discussed<br />\nbefore. Michael Hooker, Dean<br />\nof Undergraduate and Graduate<br />\nStudies, Joseph Hall, Dean of<br />\nAcademic Services, and Robert<br />\nScott, Director of the Athletic<br />\nCenter, have all considered the<br />\nidea during the past few years.<br />\nHooker said, \"It has always<br />\nseemed to me that we should<br />\nmake a program available, but<br />\nstudents don't use the present<br />\nprogram.\" He added,\"Students<br />\nspend too much time in the<br />\nlibrary. They need sound minds<br />\nhoused in sound bodies.\"<br />\nAnita Prentice, Assistant<br />\nDean of Academic Services,<br />\nexplained why a proposal was<br />\nfinally drawn up.

The Athletic Center<br />\nhas proposed one semester of required phys<br />\ned for freshmen, consisting of two hours a<br />\nweek for a single credit. The program<br />\nclaims the laudable goal of seeking to instill<br />\nin students a general appreciation for<br />\nregular exercise, and of providing a basic<br />\ninstruction in first aid and nutrition.<br />\nDean Hooker has outlined three<br />\nimportant questions in regard to the<br />\nproposal which will suffice for our consideration of it here; is it necessary, should it<br />\nbe offered for credit, and should it be<br />\ncompulsory?<br />\nYes, some sort of increased orientation towards exercise is necessary. Most of<br />\nthe bodies here are screaming for physical<br />\nactivity of. any sort. The average existence<br />\nhere is cyclical, and works as follows: up<br />\nat the crack of noon after a solid four<br />\nhours, down a few bowls of nutritious<br />\nBanana Whackies, run to class clutching<br />\nsavaged intestines, collapse into a seat in<br />\nthe back row, and fall asleep. After class,<br />\nperk up with a few Toblerones in Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop, and onward until the final<br />\nstumble out of the Hut at four a.m.<br />\nThe problem with the Athletic<br />\nCenter's proposal in regard to the above<br />\nregimen is that it won't make a dent. Two<br />\nhours a week, even if it were enough to<br />\nplant the seed of appreciation for regular<br />\nexercise, is far too little to get anyone<br />\nthinking and planning with an eye towards<br />\nphysical exertion. Most students would<br />\nprobably tank up on Toblerones anyway<br />\nand come in late for those two hours a<br />\nweek. If the program is to avoid being like<br />\nso many other obligatory courses for the<br />\nnon-participant, something like an hour<br />\neach day of the week would be a lot more<br />\nvaluable.<br />\nBut then of course, you have the<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\nStart Here, Duck<br /><br />\nDana G illian<br /><br />\nTo The Editor:<br /><br />\nNo Dope Media<br />\nBY MICHAEL LORTON<br />\nI objected, quite strenuously, to the inclusion of the<br />\n\"Outside World\" article on drug<br />\nat Homewood.

Being an adult means being able to<br />\ndo certain things when and if you feel like<br />\nit. Besides, if the University's interest is in<br />\nmaking us all into well-rounded human<br />\nbeings (well, maybe not so round), then it<br />\nhas some revising to do in the rest of the<br />\ncurriculum. Most majors here concentrate<br />\nextensively in a single area\u2014it's what most<br />\nstudents come to Hopkins to do.

The issue<br />\nwas raised in the News-Letter in<br />\nRobin Johnson's Opinion article<br />\non fraternity rush 2 weeks ago<br />\nand was discussed in letters by<br />\nDavid Hurwitz and David Bellinger last week.<br />\nI have no first-hand information about the \"stripper parties\" or raffles involving prostitution which Ms. Johnson mentioned. But I read no denials<br />\nlast week that they have occurred.<br />\nIn much of our society, the<br />\nblatant oppression and degradation of women remains more<br />\nsocially acceptable than does<br />\novert racism. But I see no great<br />\ndifference in the principle between them.<br />\nMr. Hurwitz<br />\noffered his opinion that such<br />\nactivities offer \"genuine fun,\"<br />\nand are \"incredibly healthy,\"<br />\nand so on. Whether he meant all<br />\nthis seriously or not, I fear that<br />\nhis comments reflect a popular<br />\nattitude. Would he also defend<br />\nsimilar practices built on racism<br />\nrather than sexism?<br />\nIf people attempt to achieve<br />\nsome sense of camaraderie (as<br />\nMr. Bellinger suggests) through<br />\nactivities involving the abuse of<br />\nthemselves (e.g., heavy alcohol<br />\nconsumption) and of others, it is<br />\na tragedy for them as well as<br />\nfor anyone they victimize in the<br />\nprocess.<br />\nCertainly problems like sexism and alcohol abuse are deeply<br />\nrooted in this society. They are<br />\nnot unique to the campus. But<br />\nwe do have to deal with'them<br />\nand their consequences here. I<br />\nthink that Ms. Johnson was<br />\nquite correct to raise these<br />\nissues.<br />\nI was also struck by the<br />\narticle in the last News-Letter by<br />\nthe woman who discussed her<br />\nexperience as a victim of rape.<br />\nShe concluded that she would<br />\nnot want to live if she were<br />\nraped again. This tragedy seems<br />\nto me related to the other<br />\nproblem. It reminded me of an<br />\nincident in which a friend of<br />\nmine, then an undergraduate<br />\n(not at JHU), was raped by an<br />\nacquaintance of hers. I don't<br />\nbelieve that he was what we<br />\nusually call psychopathic. But<br />\nhe was quite drunk at the time.<br />\nI think that, to the extent that<br />\nwe accept certain kinds of sexist'<br />\nor racist behavior as having \"a<br />\ngood time,\" we help perpetuate<br />\na social environment which leads<br />\nto such violence.<br />\nI believe that it is possible<br />\nfor people to develop meaningful, lasting friendships and a<br />\npositive sense of belonging to a<br />\ngroup\u2014and even to have lots of<br />\nfun\u2014without abusing themselves<br />\nor others. I think that that is<br />\nworth striving for. And I think<br />\nthat anyone who opposes any<br />\nsexist or racist or other such<br />\nexploitative and dehumanizing<br />\nactivities on this campus or<br />\nanywhere is absolutely right to<br />\nchallenge them.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nRobert A. Seidel.<br /><br />\nMorality:LowReturn<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe main point that the<br />\nInvestment Morality<br />\nPublic<br />\nCommittee seems to miss in its<br />\nletter (\"A Moral Investment,\"<br />\nN-L, Feb. 12) is that Hopkins<br />\ndoes not invest its money in<br />\ncorporations to support their<br />\npublic policies, but rather to<br />\nreceive a profitable return on its<br />\ninvestment funds. The PIMC is<br />\nalarmed because \"these funds<br />\ncan potentially find their way<br />\ninto corporations such as Nestle<br />\nor others who might develop<br />\nnuclear weaponry or have<br />\ndealings in South Africa. Thus,<br />\nHopkins could be directly<br />\nsupporting corporations whose<br />\npolicies don't adhere to the<br />\nprevaling morality.\" My question is, whose morality is the<br />\nprevailing one? Not all of us<br />\nthink that nuclear weaponry is<br />\ninherently immoral. And one<br />\nhas only to look back to the<br />\nMcCarthy monkey business of<br />\nthe 50's to realize that the<br />\nprevailing morality can be mass<br />\nhysteria at its worst and just<br />\nmass confusion at its best. It is<br />\nalso quite inaccurate to say that<br />\nHopkins is directly supporting<br />\nthese corporations: we would<br />\nnot make such investments if the<br />\ncorporations were not supporting us, at least in part.<br />\nHighly moral and compassionate businesses do not<br />\ngenerally rake in large enough<br />\nprofits to be of interest to a<br />\nuniversity like Hopkins. Perhaps<br />\ninvesting in Mother Theresa's<br />\norphanage could soothe some<br />\nconcerned consciences, but the<br />\ndifference in, funds would eventually show up as a tuition hike<br />\nthat would come out of everyone's pocket, even the committee members'. Such financial<br />\nstraits could also result in the<br />\ndisbanding of of superfluous<br />\nstudent groups like the PIMC.<br />\nHopkins' main purpose is academic, not political, despite<br />\nwhat certain groups of the<br />\nStudent Council believe.

In preface to the<br />\narticle, we print here in full the<br />\nUniversity Ethics Board's policy<br />\non drug use by students:<br />\n\"The distribution and possession<br />\nof unprescribed narcotics and<br />\nother controlled, dangerous substances by students is unlawful<br />\nand strictly forbidden on University premises. When Information<br />\nreaches the University indicating<br />\nthat a student has been engaged<br />\nin the distribution of controlled<br />\nsubstances, disciplinary proceedings which may lead to expulsion or suspension will be<br />\ncommenced immediately. Students are also advised that the<br />\nUniversity may decline to furnish and may withdraw letters of<br />\nrecommendation for those who<br />\nhave engaged in the illegal<br />\ndistribution possession and use<br />\nof controlled dangerous substances.\"<br />\np. 16 of Undergraduate Manual<br /><br />\nLet's face it, folks: there<br />\nare drugs on campus.

Marijuana is a hemp plant containing<br />\nthe psychoactive agent THC,<br />\nwhose effect on the brain is not<br />\ncompletely known. In fact,<br />\nscientists are so unsure about<br />\nhow THC actually effects the<br />\nbrain that there are many studies<br />\nusing similar data which come<br />\nup with entirely different conclusions. Prolonged use of the<br />\ndrug will leave you in a very<br />\nrelaxed, albeit lackadaisical, state<br />\nof mind. You may lose some<br />\nmotivation<br />\nand clarity of<br />\nthought, but you are also less<br />\nhigh-strung, a benefit appreciated by many.<br />\nThere are basically two<br />\ndifferent types of marijuana:<br />\ncheap, and expensive. But you<br />\nget what you pay for. The<br />\ncheaper variety of pot, which is<br />\nalways in season, is usually sold<br />\nin ounces and half-ounces, with<br />\nprices ranging anywhere from<br />\n$30 to $40 an ounce. It is also<br />\nfairly attainable in $5 and $10<br />\nquantities, although when you<br />\nbuy such small amounts, you<br />\nrun the risk of being ripped off,<br />\nsince no one has come up with<br />\nthe definitive answer to how<br />\nmuch is in a nickel ($5 bag).<br />\nThis cheaper variety, usually of<br />\nColombian origin, is a harsher<br />\nsmoke than the more expensive<br />\nSinsemilla.

Hashish, which is a<br />\nconcentrated form of THC,<br />\ncomes in three colors: blond,<br />\nbrown, and black. Around here,<br />\nit's usually blond at $5-7 a gram,<br />\nbut there hasn't been much for a<br />\nwhile.<br />\nHash is fun, because there<br />\nare several ways of smoking it.<br />\nBesides the conventional methods of smoking pot, you can also<br />\nsmoke hash under a glass on the<br />\nend of a pin, or mixed with<br />\ntobacco in a cigarette (the<br />\nEuropean method).<br />\nThe real drawback of hash,<br />\nwhich is much more apparent<br />\nthan with marijuana, is the fact<br />\nthat it has a very high tar level,<br />\nwhich, with extended use, can<br />\nproduce a hacking cough, and<br />\nincrease your susceptibility to<br />\nchest colds. So take it easy<br />\nwith the 'shish. Don't smoke it<br />\n\u2022 too many days in a row, or you<br />\nmay have to give it up altogether<br />\nfor a while. Also, there is a danger with marijuana (unheard of<br />\non this campus to my knowledge) that the original plant has<br />\nbeen treated with insect herbicides which can cause serious<br />\nillness. It may have also been<br />\ntreated with PCP or \"angel<br />\ndust,\" which can cause brain<br /><br />\ndamage. These substances cannot be detected prior to use.<br />\nMarijuana and hashish also<br />\nhave therapeutic value. According to Goodman and Gilman's<br />\nThe Pharmacological Basis of<br />\nTherapeutics (sixth edition,<br />\nMacMillan, copyright 1980),<br />\nTHC counteracts nausea which<br />\nis a side-effect of chemotherapy<br />\nand also relieves the pain involved in chemotherapy because<br />\nof its analgesic qualities.

Says the letter, \"The<br />\nEducation Committee flatly opposes assigning graduate students<br />\nto teach courses where they<br />\ncannot attend every lecture.\"<br />\nThe letter goes on to assert<br />\nthat another concern of students<br />\nhere is the \"discrepancy in<br />\ngrading policies among the<br />\nteaching assistants within each<br />\ncourse.\" To amend this problem, the Committee urges \"consultation among teaching assistants to standardize grading policies for each course.\"<br />\nA third and final charge<br />\nmade by the Education Committee's letter is that the greatest<br />\nconcern of students was \"the<br />\ndisregard displayed by some<br />\nteaching assistants for their<br />\nestablished office hours.\" The<br />\nletter concludes that \"such disregard prevents students from<br />\nobtaining assistance with course<br />\nwork.\"<br />\nThe letter that was approved by the Committee is the<br />\nresult of several weeks' drafting<br />\nand redrafting by that Committee. The original letter, presented to the Committee last week,<br />\ncontained wording that a majority of its members considered<br />\ntoo harsh. The original draft<br />\ncharged that some teaching<br />\nassistants were guilty of \"gross<br />\nnegligence\" in failing to attend<br />\nlectures. It also charged that<br /><br />\nsome teaching fellows showed an<br />\n\"appalling disregard\" for their<br />\nestablished office hours.<br />\nThis original letter was<br />\nsubmitted to Michael Hooker,<br />\nDean of Undergraduate and<br />\nGraduate Studies, for his recomDean Hooker,<br />\nmendations.<br />\naccording to Committee chairman Doug Fellrnan, saw fit to<br />\nrewrite the entire letter and<br />\nreturn it to the Committee. The<br />\nCommittee, while voicing its<br /><br />\nown objections to the letter, saw<br />\nfit not to send Dean Hooker's<br />\nrewrite instead of its original.<br />\nThey decided, however, to modify the tone of its letter.<br />\nThe results of this modification were submitted to the<br />\nCommittee on Tuesday. After<br />\nmaking<br />\nthree<br />\ngrammatical<br />\nchanges, the Committee voted<br />\nunanimously to accept the reworded letter.<br /><br />\nBA-MDProgram<br />\nMayBe Terminated<br />\nFrank H.

Due to the high<br />\ncost of toot, it is a much less<br />\nsocial drug than marijuana. People become possessive of their<br />\nlines, and if you walk in on a<br />\nsnorting session, chances are you<br />\nwill leave the room somewhat<br />\nred-faced. For all the \"virtues\"<br />\nof this wonder drug, this reporter can take it or leave it.<br />\nFrequent use can leave one<br />\nwith a perforated nasal septum<br />\n(the part inside the nose between the nostrils). When you<br />\nfirst snort it, your nose is<br />\nnumbed. After the initial rush,<br />\nyou feel good for several hours,<br />\nbut because of the excess energy<br />\nreleased, when you come down,<br />\nyou come down hard. To get<br />\nback up, either you sleep longer<br />\nthan normal, or you do another<br />\nline. These factors, coupled<br />\nwith the more intimate nature of<br />\nthe drug, make it fine for tete a<br />\ntete consumption, but cocaine<br />\njust isn't a large-crowd drug.<br />\nAlthough all street cocaine<br />\nis cut, the quality of the cut is<br />\nimportant. Mannitol is the best<br />\nfiller cut in that it has no real<br />\neffects other than stretching<br />\ncoke. Often, however, coke is<br />\ncut with speed in order to<br />\nincrease the sensation of wiredness. This is fairly noticeable<br />\nbecause speed burns when snorted, unlike cocaine, which is<br />\nmuch more anesthetic.<br />\nA<br />\ncocaine-consumer tip: try before you buy. You never know<br />\nwhat you're getting into otherwise.<br /><br />\nHALLUCINOGENS<br />\nThere are two basic types in<br />\nthis category: synthetic and<br />\norganic. The synthetic variety<br />\nincludes psychedelics such as<br />\nDMT, a short-term (one half<br />\nhour) trip in powder form,<br />\nusually snorted or smoked;<br />\nMDA, a slightly longer-lasting<br />\nversion of DMT; and the everpopular LSD. Although the first<br />\ntwo are quite rare, LSD is almost<br />\nconstantly available. \"<br />\nLysergic acid-diethylamide is<br />\nprobably the most potent recreational drug available. A mere<br />\n200 micrograms will keep you<br />\ntripping for at least eight hours.<br />\nUncle Sidney is sold in many<br />\nblotter, which are<br />\nforms:<br />\nsmall squares of paper, usually<br />\nwith a picture of some sort<br />\nprinted on it; microdots(barrels,<br />\ntabs), which are very small pills,<br />\nusually purple or blue; windowpane, a gelatin square (sometimes in the form of pyramids)<br />\nwhich comes in every color you<br />\ncan think of; and liquid, which is<br />\nthe original form (just a drop in<br />\neach eye and you're set for the<br />\nrest of the night). Blotter is the<br />\nmost common form of campus<br />\nconsumption, with hits averaging<br />\n$2 to $3. As with Quaaludes,<br />\nacid is usually diluted with other<br />\ndrugs, such as speed, before it's<br />\nput on the blotter, and potency<br />\nvaries from batch to batch. So<br />\nbefore you eat it, ask around to<br />\nsee how good it is, and whether<br />\nor not you will need more than<br />\none hit. A rule of thumb: if it<br />\ntakes more than three hits to get<br />\noff, you're wasting your time,<br /><br />\neven if it's free.<br />\nThe most common type of<br />\norganic on campus is the mushroom, although it is infrequent.<br />\nMany people prefer `shrooms<br />\nbecause the trip tends to be<br />\nmore mellow than with acid,<br />\nalthough they are more expensive. A quarter ounce (seven<br />\ngrams) of mushrooms cost<br />\n$3545, and you have to eat one<br />\nto two grams. The worst part of<br />\nthe mushroom experience is the<br />\nfirst half hour, beginning with<br />\nA good way<br />\neating them.<br />\nto hide the taste is to eat them<br />\nwith peanut butter. The sensations begin in the stomach, with<br />\na bit of queasiness, but that<br />\npasses fairly quickly and the<br />\ntripping begins.<br />\nPsychedelics are not habitforming, unless you happen to<br />\nenjoy them. But there exists<br />\ndefinite potential for problems<br />\nfrom overuse. Extreme intro.spection and an unsure concept<br />\nof reality are two very possible<br />\neffects. You may also experience flashbacks, which are a<br />\nrecurrence of the acid-induced<br />\nstate of mind, after not having<br />\ntripped for a while, and extreme<br />\ncases have sent people to mental<br />\nHanucinogenics<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nhave the highest possibility of<br />\ndangerous side-effects of all the<br />\nsocial drugs, but they can also be<br />\nithe most enjoyable and spiritually uplifting.

They aren't mystical<br />\nsubstances, only mind-alterers.<br />\nEverything is a grand revelation<br />\nwhen you're tripping: don't<br />\nabandon those revelations afterwards, but don't overemphasize<br />\nthem either. Above all, don't<br />\ntrip alone, at least not the first<br />\ntime. Find someone you trust<br />\nwho's tripped before, so they<br />\ncan help you along if the going<br />\ngets rough.<br /><br />\nAs a closing note to this<br />\narticle on campus drugs, I would<br />\nlike to stress one important<br />\npoint: moderation. It's not<br />\nhard to overdo any good thing,<br />\nand drugs, with their potential<br />\nfor release, open themselves to<br />\nabuse. So take it easy. But have<br />\na good time, 'cause that's what<br />\nlife is all about.

The same basic<br />\nquestions were asked of all nine professors and their answers have been printed verbatim without editing.<br /><br />\nJ.P. Walker<br />\nDepartment ofPhysics<br />\nN-L: Do you believe<br />\nthere is grade inflation<br />\nat Hopkins?<br />\nWalker: I don't know<br />\nwhat you mean by<br />\ngrade inflation. Do you<br />\nmean that in recent<br />\nyears the percentage of<br />\nstudents getting higher<br />\ngrades has increased?<br />\nN-L: More B's proportionally than A's or C's,<br />\naccording to the Bell-shaped curve.<br />\nWalker: If you define it that way, yes. I think there is<br />\ngrade inflation at Hopkins. I think it is right to have<br />\nmore than a simple answer. In the case of my physics<br />\ncourse, I gave the largest number of A's that I've ever<br />\ngiven in this past semester's course. The reason is that I<br />\ndon't grade on a curve, I grade on an absolute scale<br />\nbased on my experience, and a very large number of<br />\nstudents did a very good job. I gave harder exams than<br />\nI've given in several years and the students did better on<br />\nthem. If that's grade inflation, then so be it. I think the<br />\nstudents learned more and I'm not particularly alarmed<br />\nby it.<br />\nN-L: Do you think there is grade inflation, in your<br />\ndepartment?<br />\nWalker: I think that students are making higher grades<br />\nthan they used to and in some cases it is because they<br />\nhave a heightened interest in preparing a record for some<br />\npre-professional training; they think their grades are<br />\nmore important than students in the past, and they are<br />\nworking harder. That's my experience, it may not be in<br />\ngeneral true in the department, and that kind of grade<br />\ninflation I'm not worried about\u2014if students do well the<br />\ngrades should reflect it.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel students in your department have to<br />\nwork harder for an A than students in another department?<br />\nWalker: I don't know. Those of us in the physics<br />\ndepartment feel physics students are generally made to<br />\nwork harder. Students in my course say they spend a lot<br />\nof time. How well they do in other departments, I can't<br />\nbe sure; I think that physics students have to work.<br />\nN-L: Do you believe that plus/minus grading will<br />\ncontribute to or alleviate grade inflation?<br />\nWalker: I don't think it will alleviate grade inflation,<br />\nand since I was one of the proponents of it, I hope that<br />\nit won't contribute to grade inflation. I think that in the<br />\nshort term it might; I think that a feeling of there being<br />\nmore gradations might, in the beginning, cause students<br />\nto worry more about their gradations. I hope that once<br />\nthings settle down, this won't be the case. I think that<br />\nstudents who from the beginning are accustomed trplus/minus grades, and that's all they know,the effect i..<br />\nsmaller. This is one of the reasons why I'm happy that<br />\nthe University will implement grades only for the new<br />\nstudents. Students who have been accustomed to the<br />\nold scheme will not have plus/minus grading in their<br />\ncareers. My basic feeling is plus/minus grading will<br />\nprobably be neutral, with regard to competition;competition starts in the minds of the student. My course is<br />\ntaught so that students aren't working against each<br />\nother, they are working against my standards in the<br />\ncourse. So, if everyone makes an A,everyone gets an A.<br />\nIf everyone makes an F, everyone gets an. F. I think<br />\nprofessors should grade students against their own<br />\nstandards and not against each other.<br /><br />\nN-L: Explain your grading policy, and do you think it is<br />\nmore subjective or objective?<br /><br />\ngrades will come out by changing the difficulty of a<br />\ngiven examination.<br /><br />\nCarl Christ<br /><br />\nWalker: More than what? I want to be as objective as<br />\npossible, but I don't imagine for a minute that grades are<br />\nalways perfect. But, I've tried to tell the students that I<br />\ntry to make up exams so that 90% of the exam will<br />\nconstitute what I consider an A, so that 80-90 will be a<br />\nB grade, and a 70-80 a C grade, a 60-70 a D grade, and N-L: Do you believe<br />\nbelow 60 a failure, and in fact it often slips. It never there is grade inflation<br />\nslips up, it sometimes slips down a little, but it's basical- at Hopkins?<br />\nly that kind of standard. I don't care how many A's<br />\nthere are and I was hard pressed last semester because Christ: Though there<br />\nthere were a lot of them, but that can't make me look at has been in the past, I<br />\nstudent number 125 and because there are X number of don't know whether it<br />\nA's so far, I can't down him. He makes what he makes. still exists. I haven't<br />\nIt's certainly somewhat subjective. You can never make detected it in the past<br />\nrules that will make it completely objective. The reason three or four years. I<br />\nfor plus/minus grading is to enable one to give a grade suspect that the averthat more nearly matches what the student's done. In age GPA of students here at Hopkins has stopped rising.<br />\nthose courses particularly where grades are based on<br />\nnumerical averages. Deciding where to cut and having a N-L: Do you feel that the grades here reflect the educastudent half a point shy on the lower side, and he ends tion that students receive?<br />\nup with a lower grade, is heart-rending to the professor<br />\ngiving the grades, meaningless as far as the grades are<br />\nconcerned, and wrong for the student.<br />\nChrist: Yes\u2014about as well as can be expected. Of<br />\ncourse, some things learned are not gradeable. Take<br />\nwhat business schools teach, for example. They prepare<br />\nfor action rather than analysis. With that in mind,<br />\ngrades would be more of an indicator of professional<br />\nsuccess for a college professor than for a business person.<br /><br />\nDepartment ofPolitical Economy<br /><br />\nJohn Gryder<br /><br />\nDepartment of Chemistry<br /><br />\nN-L: Do you believe<br />\nthere's grade inflation<br />\nat Hopkins?<br />\nGryder: Yes, but not<br />\nas bad as at other<br />\nToday,<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nthe average graduating<br />\nsenior has a GPA above<br />\n3.0. Back in the dark'<br />\nages, when I came here,<br />\nthe average was a little<br />\nover 2.0.<br />\nN-L: What caused the<br />\nchange?<br />\nGryder: A number of<br />\nthings. One of them is<br />\ntrivial, but I think it<br />\nhad an effect, and that's the invention of keeping<br />\nrecords on IBM machines. Before the advent of IBM.<br />\nmachines, if you dropped a course, some secretary<br />\nhad to erase your record of taking the course. For the<br />\nsecretary, it was much easier to type \"withdrew.\" When<br />\nrecords started to be kept on computers, it was easy to<br />\neliminate all record of having been in a course. So,<br />\nthis and late drop dates has caused only people who are<br />\ndoing well to stay in courses. Actually, in my mind,that<br />\nisn't really grade inflation. It's just a waste of a student's time to spend half a semester in a course and then<br />\ndrop it. As to other factors, on the graduate level,<br />\ndepartments started putting in a requirement that you<br />\nhad to have a B average to be in good standing. So C's<br />\nwere regarded as F's or D's. I think some of that carried<br />\nover to the undergraduate level. Professional schools<br />\nwanted higher grades. It's unfortunate that grade<br />\ninflation exists, because it makes it harder for the<br />\nstudent to really know the extent to which he has a<br />\nknowledge of the subject.<br />\nN-L: Do you think plus/minus grading will have an<br />\neffect on grade inflation?<br />\nGryder: No. It may cause the GPAs to go up a little bit<br />\nbecause some professors will use pluses and not minuses.<br />\nN-L: How do you grade?<br />\nGryder: I try to decrease the direct competition. I tell<br />\nmy class in advance that a certain numerical grade will<br />\ncorrespond to a certain letter grade. I don't do it by a<br />\ndistribution, but I try to make up the examination so a<br />\ncertain numerical score will be the median. At the same<br />\ntime, I don't want a huge variation from one semester to<br />\nanother, so as the year goes on, I try to adjust how the<br /><br />\nN-L: Do you believe that plus/minus grading will<br />\ncontribute to or alleviate grade inflation?<br />\nChrist: I don't think it will make any real difference.<br />\nAs far as cut-throatedness of students with regard to<br />\ngrades under a plus/minus system, I don't really know<br />\nwhat the effect would be. . .probably a larger number<br />\nwould care about individual grades, but they would each<br />\ncare less. Over the long run in the present system, the<br />\ndifference between one letter grade and the next lowest<br />\nletter grade alters the GPA .for the entire transcript by<br />\nabout one-third of one per cent in a single course. Also,<br />\nunder plus/minus the probability of ten course grades all<br />\ngoing the same direction away from the straight letter<br />\ngrade for a single student is one in 1024. But, I am not<br />\nprepared to go to the barricades on this issue.

I think I should set the<br />\ngrading procedure I want, and tell the class what I'm<br />\ngoing to do, and if they don't like it, they can tell me or<br />\nthey can not take the course. I think I'd rather have<br />\nthe instructor set the grading policy. I want to stress,<br />\nthough, that we don't have good feedback, we don't<br />\nknow what our colleagues are doing. The course guide<br />\nshould include more questions on grading procedures.<br />\nN-L: Do you think there is grade inflation in your own<br />\ndepartment?<br />\nCone: I think relatively little in my own department.<br />\nThose are the grades I'm a little more aware of. That's<br />\ngot to be weighted by my own grades, I'm more aware<br />\nof my own grades. For me if there was a point of grade<br />\ninflation in my own past, I think I was more generous<br />\nwith the curve somewhere in the late sixties and early<br />\nseventies. At that point I decided that rather than have<br />\nA's be some very super special grade, and have D's and<br />\nthe whole range, that I'd confine myself mostly to A's,<br />\nB's and C's, and I also feel that if I'm going to have to<br />\nmake discriminations like that, I'm going to make the<br />\ncuts where it makes the most discrimination, and that<br />\nturns out to be in the mid parts of the bell-shaped curve,<br />\nand not out at the wings. It's easy to say people way<br />\nout at either end get A's and D's; it's hard to decide in<br />\nthe middle part. I'm aware that a lot of courses get<br />\ngraded lots of B's and not many A's, not many<br />\nC's\u2014that's the easy part of the sketch for me, 'cause<br />\nyou're out in the wings. I decided that if we're going to<br />\nhave grades at all we ought to make the cuts where it<br />\nmatters more, and that means to come further in. So I<br />\ndecided almost a decade ago to go a third, a third, and a<br />\nthird: one-third A's, one-third B's, and one-third C's. I<br />\nknow that when the final grades are finished, I ease off a<br />\nbit. It ends up with more B's and fewer A's and C's.<br />\nBut my first cut is a third, a third, and a third. That's<br />\nwhat I tell all my classes, but then I become generous.<br /><br />\nCone: Thank you for asking that question. The whole<br />\nquestion of grade inflation came clear to me as soon as I<br />\ngave peer grading because most students were fearful<br />\nthat their peers would grade them down. Obviously it<br />\nwould be in your best interest to screw your classmates<br />\nso you get a better grade. So everybody is worried<br />\nabout their classmates grading them down. Instead what<br />\nhappens is (if you think that professors have inflated the<br />\ngrades) I have found that in peer grades, if I ask students<br />\nto give A's, B's, and C's, most of the students got A-'s or<br />\nB+'s. Not only grade inflation, so that there are more<br />\nA's, but all of the papers are clustered around A-/B+.<br />\nAlso I asked them to do it in terms of numbers, not<br />\ngrades. The averages came out to be between 87 and 92,<br />\nabout 90% of the grades between 85 and 93. Students<br />\nwere (nobody was willing to grade anybody down) all<br />\nclustered right around 90. What I do now is to have<br />\nstudents rank order papers. I arrange it so that each<br />\npaper is not rank ordered by a small set of numbers, but<br />\nordered against a large number. Each paper is rank<br />\nordered against 40 papers, so student's don't have to<br />\ncomplain that \"I gave you an A and you gave me a C\";<br />\nthey rank order them. And the papers get evaluated<br />\ncompared with a large body of papers. Going back to<br />\nobjectivity, one of the things that happens when you<br />\nread a lot of papers, is think how this compared with the<br />\nlast paper I read, or the last few I read. So the way I had<br />\nit work out is each paper is read to be compared with a<br />\nlarge number of papers. I also think that adds to the<br />\nobjectivity.<br /><br />\nRon Walters<br /><br />\nCone: I think it's the most objective method of giving a<br />\ngrade that I know of. Short of having.. .that is, grading<br />\non the basis of written work rather than problem sets.<br />\nThe problem when grading a paper, a person's writing,<br />\nit's hard to quantify it. What I decided to do was to<br />\nhave each paper read by many readers and to have the<br />\nauthors anonymous. I find that when I grade papers<br />\nwritten by students that I know, it is very hard for me<br />\nnot to put into that grade some sense of what I think<br />\nabout that student's overall performance. So, I feel like<br />\nI'm more objective when I read papers among others.<br />\nSecond, I think that any piece of writing is likely to ring<br />\nbells, negative or positive, with a particular reader, so<br />\nthat any particular reader's judgment is going to veer one<br />\nway or the other, so it's fairer in judging a writer, if you're<br />\nfinally going to have to give a grade, to have many<br />\npeople read one paper and for them all to read it anonymously. So, that's what I chose to do in my course.<br />\nAnd the other part of that is that I ask the student to<br />\nwrite papers for their peers, for their peers as the audience, not for the expert in the field. Writing for the<br />\nexpert in the field is easy because the expert will always<br />\nunderstand what you're trying to say. Writing for your<br />\npeers requires really understanding the material and<br />\npresenting it clearly. So it's much more demanding an<br />\nassignment to write for your peers than to write for a<br />\nprofessor. So I have them do that 'cause I think learning<br />\nhow to write well is a very important skill, because it<br />\ninvolves thinking through and understanding what<br />\nyou're writing about. That's why I have peers do the<br />\nevaluation. I assign peers to read, and have peers evalu-<br /><br />\nDepartment of History<br />\nN-L: Do you believe there is grade inflation at Hopkins?<br />\nWalters: I think there is grade inflation everywhere.

I don't think Hopkins is very far<br />\noff the norm for colleges and universities of its type.<br />\nN-L: Is it (grade inflation) in your department (History)?<br />\nWalters: I think it's probably everywhere. Grades in my<br />\ndepartment and other departments look higher to me<br />\nthan grades looked when I was an undergraduate. To<br />\nsome extent, that's not a fair comparison because I went<br />\nto Stanford, which at the time I went there was an A<br />\ncurve. Unfortunately, for instance, a 3.5 grade point<br />\naverage at Stanford was good enough to make Phi Beta<br />\nKappa in the junior year. I don't think it's good enough<br />\nto make Phi Beta Kappa in the junior year here at<br />\nHopkins, and I feel much of that's a product of the<br />\n1960's and the kind of educational changes that were<br />\naround.<br />\nNews-Letter News-Letter News-Letter News-Letter<br /><br />\nN-L: Explain your own grading system.<br />\nWalters: I don't like grading; I like reading papers, I like<br />\ncommenting on papers. My grading, I guess the best way<br />\nto talk about it in the survey course, with the teaching<br />\nassistants. What we do is talk about what constitutes<br />\nan A, what constitutes a C, a D, and failure is very<br />\nobvious. We assume that for an A,a person has to show<br />\na fairly good mastery of the material and some spark of<br />\noriginality, some evidence of critical thinking, the ability<br />\nto synthesize material. A B, again some mastery of the<br />\nmaterial, less originality or maybe less consistency. A B<br />\nmay have a good idea but not be able to defend its<br />\norigin quite right. A C, we figure, is either just consistently mediocre, or more likely, a person that doesn't<br />\nknow something that he should have known. A D<br />\ncontains factual errors, errors in logic or interpretation.<br />\nAn F is worse. Now within those general categories,<br />\nthere are people that fall in-between. There are always a<br />\nfew people each year who are very, very difficult to deal<br />\nwith. Someone whose ideas are just as good but they<br />\njust manage to screw up so thoroughly or there are<br />\npeople who just work so hard and improve so much and<br />\nwho aren't quite there. . . And it's always a problem<br />\nwhether to kick them up a notch or give them what we<br />\nthink is the real level of performance. I think plus/<br />\nminus grading helps a little bit. . . In terms of grading<br />\nstandards, in the survey course, where I don't do all the<br />\ngrading, teaching assistants do pass papers around among<br />\nthemselves. We sit down and pass papers around among<br />\nall of us and then I spot check papers. I pull papers out<br />\nof the pile without either the student or the TA.knowing, and look to try to ascertain whether the papers with<br />\nthe same grade are roughly comparable. . . I'm sure<br />\nthere are exceptions to that. I'm less troubled by what I<br />\nthink are erratic grading standards than I'm troubled by<br />\ninequities within the present grading system. I know the<br />\nstudent objections to plus/minus grading and I think<br />\nthat we were unjust in hearing them, but I also think<br />\nthat when we were under the plus/minus grading system<br />\nhad a move been made to go to the Hopkins system,<br />\nthere would have been outrage and open rebellion,<br />\nbecause we regarded the plus/minus system as a safeguard. . . I remember missing an A by 1 point in a<br />\nfreshman biology course, graded on a curve. My fury<br />\nwas less getting a B+ under the plus/minus system than it<br />\nwould have been getting a B under the present system.<br />\nThe difference was between 33 and 3.7 in that case<br />\nwhere it would have been between 3 and 4 here. My<br />\nfeeling about the conversion to plus/minus grading is<br />\nthat maybe there wasn't enough discussion. I think<br />\nstudents perceived it as kind of a faculty plot. Perhaps<br />\nwe didn't get serious enough student concerns about<br />\nplus/minus. But you have to separate procedural problems from the sytem itself.

It's not as easy as it<br />\nsounds: after years of watching Nicholson mug his way through countless \"Just<br />\ncall me Badass\" movies, it's hard to tell<br />\nwhether his ever-arching eyebrows and<br />\nkiller grin are deliberate undermining<br />\ninfluences or just reflex actions. In The<br />\nBorder, the eyes are hidden most of the<br />\ntime behind aviator shades and the smile<br />\nappears only rarely, but it's still hard to<br />\ntake him seriously. It's not entirely his<br />\nfault, though \u2014 he's the prisoner of a bad<br />\nscreenplay.<br />\nNicholson plays Charlie Smith, a<br />\nrestless Immigration and Naturalization<br />\nofficial from California who, along with<br />\nhis upwardly mobile middle-class wife<br />\nMarcy (Valerie Perrine), moves from<br />\na Los Angeles trailer park to a ranch<br />\nhouse in El Paso, Texas, and takes a job<br />\nas a patrolman on the Mexican border.<br />\nWhen he's not busy shuttling potential<br />\nillegal aliens back across the Rio Grande<br />\nor getting angry at Marcy for running up<br />\nbills, he's halfheartedly socializing with<br />\nthe other guards and their wives, almost<br />\nall of whom are depicted as sleazy hicks.<br /><br />\nMeanwhile, he continues to search for<br />\n\"something to make me feel good some<br />\ntime,\" though he can't quite put a finger<br />\non what that might be.<br />\nSet up as a counterpoint to<br />\nNicholson's low-key altruism on the job<br />\nare a number of guards, including Charlie's redneck neighbor Cat(Harvey Keitel)<br />\nand the police captain (Warren Oates),<br />\nwho traffic in the \"wets\" as cheap labor<br />\nfor local farms and businesses. The<br />\nsituation makes for an interesting paradox: the underpaid guards have a responsibility to keep the Mexicans out of<br />\nthe country, yet in order to make enough<br />\nmoney to support their families they<br />\nillow many to pass \"unnoticed,\" and in<br />\n-act round most of them up on the U.S.<br />\nale and hand-deliver them to their<br />\nprospective employers. One of the major<br /><br />\n\"Shit!\" says Nicholson, while mashing hand and gnashing teeth.<br /><br />\nweaknesses of the film, however, is tndt<br />\nthe paradox is never satisfactorily explored; the workings of the system are<br />\nleft mostly to the imagination.<br />\nInstead, the movie turns to Maria<br />\n:Elpidia Carillo), a young Mexican<br />\nwoman with a newborn baby, who in her<br />\nrepeated attempts to cross the border is<br />\ncontinually crossing paths with Charlie.<br /><br />\nAnd Charlie, for no apparent reason,<br />\nbegins to sympathize with her. Again,<br />\nthe writers (Deric Washburn, Walon<br />\n3reen, and David Freeman) have miscalmlated badly by never fully explaining<br />\nhe nature of the relationship between<br />\n.2harlie<br />\nand Maria: it could be sexual,<br />\nilthough most of the evidence in the film<br />\ngoes against that; it could be paternalistic<br />\n(Charlie and Marcy are childless). Any<br />\nnumber of speculations could be made,<br />\nbut unfortunately none of them are<br />\nsupported by the screenplay. The best<br />\nexplanation seems to be that Maria<br />\nbecomes Charlie's \"moral center,\" just<br />\nthe thing he needs to save him from his<br />\nsuburban anomie and the corruptive<br />\ninfluences of his fellow workers; still, the<br />\nreasons for this are never made clear.<br />\nOnce more the story shifts focus<br />\nwhen it should be delving more deeply<br />\ninto the questions it's raising. When<br />\nMaria's baby is stolen by the black<br />\nmarket (with the tacit consent of the<br />\nborder police), and Charlie takes it upon!<br />\nhimself to rescue the child, the plot lapses<br />\ninto a good guys/bad guys morality play<br />\nfrom which it is never able to extricate<br />\nitself. One begins to wonder, despite all<br />\nthe fascinating issues the film raises (not<br />\nthe least among them being the mystery<br />\nof Charlie's psychological makeup), if the<br />\nfilmmakers really had no higher ambition<br />\nthan to create a sort of Tex-Mex Dirty<br />\nHarry.<br />\nThe director, Tony Richardson<br />\n(Tom Jones, The Loneliness of the Long<br />\nDistance Runner), in conjunction with<br />\ncinematographers Ric Waite and Vilmos<br />\nZsigmond, has painted a harsh, sleazy<br />\nportrait of both the geography and the<br />\ninhabitants of the area so realistically that<br />\nthe glaring white sun and the grime on<br />\npeople's faces almost become characters<br />\nin themselves; the acting throughout<br />\nranges from good to excellent; and Ry<br />\nCooder's eerie, mystical score perfectly<br />\ncrossbreeds Mexican exoticism with menacing Texas rock rhythms. But, for all its<br />\ntexture, The Border is ultimately a<br />\n.;ornball melodrama. This deficiency<br />\nmakes Nicholson's stunning, controlled<br />\nperformance stand out all the more, but<br />\nit also makes painfully clear that Nicholson, with morals or without, is all this<br />\npicture has going for it.<br /><br />\n[AIRT 5]<br /><br />\nOne Man Show:Emlyn WilliamsAsDickens<br />\nBY JESSICA KUBZANSKY<br />\n\"It was the best of times, it was<br />\nthe worst of times.\" If you like solo<br />\nperformances by an actor portraying an<br />\nauthor reading his own classic scenes,<br />\nEmlyn Williams as Charles Dickens is the<br />\nbest of evenings. If you get bored seeing<br />\none man standing at a table for two and a<br />\nhalf hours, Emlyn Williams as Charles<br />\nDickens As the worst of evenings.<br />\nAttending the show presently at the<br />\nMechanic is like being at a feast where<br />\nthe sole food offered is caviar. If you like<br />\ncaviar, you're in for a treat. If not, well<br />\n...time to stay home and break out the<br />\nfrosted flakes.<br />\nEmlyn Williams, whose only props<br />\nfor the two-and-a-half-hour performance<br />\nare a small table and five volumes of<br />\nDickens, gives an excellent rendition of<br />\neach of the nine scenes on the program.<br />\nWilliams appears to be authentic Dickens:<br />\nhis snowy hair is brushed back from his<br />\nwell worn face, he sports a mustache, and<br />\nwears a thin, silky beard that hangs from<br />\nhis chin like a dolphin's tail.<br />\nWilliams does the show entirely<br />\nwithout scripts, despite cursory references to the volumes at hand. He has a<br />\nvoice of infinite variation; he can portray<br />\na boy of six as easily as he can an old hag.<br /><br />\nHis facial ex \u2022resions and estures enhance<br /><br />\n' Emlyn William's<br /><br />\nthe dramatic content of the scenes.<br />\nWilliams' comedic timing is also very<br />\ngood\u2014the pauses are effective and the<br />\ninflections appropriate.<br />\nThis skill draws us into the world<br />\nof Dickens and the characters of his time.<br />\nNotwithstanding- Williams' talent, the<br />\n\"scripts,\" of course, make the show,as all<br />\nthe humor and pacing depends on the<br />\nlines spoken. Dickens' imagery is marvelous, but at times the limitations of a<br />\none-man show surpass the quality of the<br />\nscript: the concentration required is<br />\ngreat, as words, not actions are the<br />\ncaptors of attention. Without physical<br />\nreinforcements, if attention slips at all,<br />\nthe impact of the lines, and thus the<br />\nstory, is lost.<br />\nThe scenes themselves are told<br />\nfrom different Dickensian viewpoints,<br />\nincluding excerpts from The Pickwick<br />\nPapers, Dombey and Sons, A Tale of Two<br />\nCities, and others. Williams does the first<br />\nscene, \"Moving in Society,\" in a dry,<br />\nslightly sardonic tone that makes the<br />\nhumor wry. The second scene is perhaps<br />\nslightly more interesting because it is<br />\nnarrated by a character, forcing Williams<br />\nto play more of a role than that of the<br />\nauthor. The narrative voice continues to<br />\nchange from scene to scene, but Williams<br />\nremains consistently in fine form.<br />\nThe real weakness (and it is a<br />\nweakness common to all solo performances) of Emlyn Williams as Charles<br />\nDickens becomes apparent around the<br />\nfifth scene. The realization that this is<br />\nvery much like those before it, and will<br />\nprobably be the same as those following<br />\nafter it.<br />\nAlthough internally (within<br />\neach scene) there is a rise, climax, and fall<br />\nof action, externally (throughout the<br />\nperformance) there is virtually no change.<br />\nThis lack of dramatic escalation can lead<br />\nto the fidgets, unless you have carefully<br />\nprepared yourself for a static evening of<br />\nCharles Dickens readings.<br />\nThe raison d'etre behind-the solo<br />\nperformance of Emlyn Williams is pointed out in varying ways several different<br />\ntimes during the evening. First of all,<br />\nDickens used to read his own works in<br />\nperformance as a kind of \"second ca-<br /><br />\nreer.\" Then, in the tourtn scene, a<br />\ncharacter discusses the \"fashion of<br />\nimmortality,\" and this is illustrated when,<br />\nat the end of the 20th century, Williams<br />\nperpetuates something that was written<br />\nin the 19th century. Next, Dickens<br />\nhimself (and incidentally<br />\njustifies<br />\nWilliams) as a solo performer when<br />\nWiliams quotes something about ladies<br />\nand gentlemen who get their living out of<br />\nthe public. Then, in his very Versatile<br />\nvoice, Williams gives vent to a small,<br />\nmeaningful chuckle.<br />\nThe essence of Williams' reason<br />\nfor his performance, however, is illustrated at the very end of the evening,<br />\nwhen, after bowing several times to the<br />\naudience, Williams turns and bows to the<br />\nvolumes of Dickens. This, then, becomes<br />\nthe final analysis\u2014Emlyn Williams as<br />\nCharles Dickens is a tribute. Dickens was<br />\na great writer, and Williams is a great<br />\nperformer.

As director of The<br />\nLast Metro, Truffaut once again proves<br />\nthat he is a serious artist who can offer a<br />\nprofound and distinct vision of reality.<br />\nA period piece, The Last Metro is<br />\nset in occupied France during World War<br />\nII. Its position in time requires that the<br />\nsubject of politics be broached, something that Truffaut avoids in most of his<br />\nfilms. Nevertheless, it is deftly done<br /><br />\nwithout relying on an artillery of antiNazi propaganda. Truffaut's film is more<br />\nthan an attack on anti-Semitism; it is a<br />\ntribute to theater and the show-business<br />\ntypes who prevail over almost insurmountable odds.<br />\nAs a cultural melodrama about a<br />\n:heater troupe's survival in occupied<br />\nParis, the film's premise is based on fact:<br />\nthe activities of the racist critic Main<br />\nLaubreaux, who dominated the French<br />\ntheater at that time.

The avantgarde split into two factions: the punks<br />\nwent for a jarring electric guitar sound,<br />\nwhile the more esoteric pursued art-rock's<br />\nlatest incarnation, the New Romantics,<br />\nand layers of synthesizer. Even former<br />\npop bastions of the acoustic guitar, those<br />\nchampioning the \"wimp\" sound (read<br />\nJackson Browne, the Eagles, et al.),<br />\nentered a tentative world of electrical<br />\ninstruments. Some may go as far to say<br />\nthat it was all downhill for acoustics since<br />\nthe Newport Folk Festival of 1965 when<br />\nBob Dylan betrayed us all.

In this day of album<br />\nfiller, a double album without any bad<br />\nsongs is a miracle, but Settlement is just<br />\nthat. (This is a review of the English<br />\nimport; the yet to be released American<br />\nalbum may only be a single disc.)<br />\nNot that the album is without<br />\nfaults: XTC has literally followed the<br />\nroute of the Clash; preaching a bit too<br />\nmuch for a new world order where<br />\neverybody loves everybody. \"Melt the<br />\nGuns\" becomes XTC's \"Washington<br />\nBullets,\" a rant against the U.S.A. for<br />\nselling the gun mentality not only to its<br />\nown citizens but to the entire world.<br />\nDespite the catchy chorus hook, the song<br />\ntends to lag, and eventually the weight of<br />\nthe lyrics drags it down.<br />\nOn the other hand, \"Knuckle<br />\nDown\" is a simple reggae-riffed rocker<br />\nthat exhorts one to \"knuckle down, love<br />\nhis race/It doesn't matter if you win or<br />\nlose a little face.\" The song is short in<br />\ncomparison to \"Guns,\" and in the end,<br />\nthe syrupy lyrics and music leave you<br />\nhappier for the experience.

The latest disaster occurred Wednesday night, as the<br />\nJays lost at Haverford, 68-66.<br />\nThe loss dropped Hopkins' record to 8-13 overall, and 2-7 in<br />\nIt also<br />\nthe MAC-Southeast.<br />\nbroke the Jays' three-game winning streak over Haverford.<br />\nDespite trailing Haverford<br />\n33-26 at the half, the Jays came<br />\nout smoking in the second half.<br />\nThey quickly knotted the score<br />\nat 33-33. However, they were<br />\nunable to steam ahead, getting<br />\ncaught in a see-saw battle.<br />\nTrailing 59-57, with about<br />\nthree minutes remaining, the<br />\nJays surged ahead 62-59. However, Hopkins blew the lead and<br />\ntwo late free throws by Haverford put them ahead 67-66.<br />\nHaverford added a free throw to<br /><br />\nthe Jays a 9-8 advantage. Widener quickly outscored the Jays<br />\n12-4 to take a 20-13 lead. Two<br />\nfoul shots by McShea, a bucket<br />\nby Scott Barr, two fcee throws<br />\nby Clayton and a corner jumper<br />\nby Tom Tessitore gave the Jays a<br />\n21-20 lead with 5:30 remaining<br />\nin the half. It turned out to be<br />\nthe last time the Jays led in the<br />\ngame. Widener regrouped and<br />\nwent ahead 30-25, but buckets<br />\nby Benninghoff and Clayton<br />\nclosed the margin at halftime to<br />\n30-29.<br />\nIn the second half, Hopkins<br />\nand Widener traded baskets for<br />\nthe first few minutes. A bucket<br />\nby Glen Wall brought the Jays to<br />\nwithin one point, 36-35. Hopkins was then beaten backdoor<br />\ntwice and soon found itself<br />\ntrailing 44-35. The Jays lost all<br />\ntheir momentum and never came<br />\nwithin striking distance as Widener easily broke the Hopkins<br />\npress.

A color<br />\nTV was the only answer, so Dad<br />\nbought one from one of his<br />\nchildhood friends who sold us<br />\nthe refrigerator the year before<br />\nwhich my mother's sister-in-law<br />\nnow has, but that's a different<br />\nstory with a very similar ending.<br />\nDad brought home the set<br />\nin time for the first landing on<br />\nthe moon. Not one kid at camp<br />\nthat afternoon cared about scoring the winning run or making<br />\nthe game-ending catch. All they<br />\nwanted to do was to home<br />\nand watch Neil Armstrong make<br />\nhis historic step.

Mom<br />\ncalled up Rich's mother because<br />\none day I brought home 978<br />\ncards, and she wanted to know<br />\nwhere I had gotten them. She<br />\nthreatened not to give me<br /><br />\nallowance that week so I decided<br />\nto tell her because Series Seven<br />\nwas coming out in two weeks,<br />\nand Rich wouldn't be able to<br />\ngive me any; his cousin moved to<br />\nCalifornia, or at least that's what<br />\nRich said.<br />\nThe four of us used to sit in<br />\nthe back of the bus, but we were<br />\nsix in all: two sisters sat up<br />\nfront because they liked the bus<br />\ndriver and hated us.

He wasn't on the<br />\nbus that afternoon, but I wish he<br />\nwere. He didn't talk much but<br />\nyou could always talk to him<br />\nabout anything.
