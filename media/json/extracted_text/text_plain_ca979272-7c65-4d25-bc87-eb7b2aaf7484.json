The Senior Class being<br />\nnumerically very small, asked the<br />\nJunior class to establish the precedent of giving the seniors a Prom.<br />\nat the end of the year. After some<br />\nlittle discussion on the subject, a<br />\ncommittee was appointed to confer<br />\nwith the president of the Sophomore<br />\nClass as to their willingness to establish this custom in the future.<br />\nA banquet committee, consisting<br />\nof R.

They<br />\ndo not affect the varsity, which is, as<br />\nusual, going to add another championship banner to our Trophy Room<br />\ncollection, but they have, nevertheless, an important bearing upon the<br />\nsport.<br />\nLast year a local lacrosse league<br />\nwas formed: composed of ova sophomore and freshmen teams, Baltimore<br />\nCity College, and the Mt. Washington Juniors. This year the Friends'<br />\nSchool has been admitted and there is<br />\nsome talk of a team from Polytechnic.<br />\nThe Hopkins Team of 1902 has in<br />\nthe past offered prizes of cups or<br />\nmedals to the members of the team<br />\nwhich should win two games in a<br />\nseries of three between the sophomores and freshmen. This year, however, these prizes are to be offered<br />\nto the winner in this new league, and<br />\nit is somewhat doubtful whether or<br />\nnot the inter-class games will be held.<br />\nIn view of the fact that varsity<br />\nmen cannot be used in the games of<br />\nthis league, the two under classes arz<br />\nplanning to combine forces and enter<br />\nbut one joint team. This under-class<br />\nteam will be lead by Max Paulus,<br />\nthe sophomore captain, and its manager will be James Easter.<br />\nThe object in extending the competition for the 1902 prizes has been<br />\nthat it will have a healthful influence<br />\niipon lacrosse in Baltimore and,by enlivening the interest in the game<br />\namong the schools, help in training<br />\nVoys\u2014some of whom are sure to<br />\ncome to Hopkins\u2014in the sport. The<br />\nmembers of the League are raising<br />\nmoney among themselves to buy some<br />\nprizes for the team which will finish<br />\nsecond in the series. The future of<br />\nthis new lacrosse organization looks<br />\nvery bright, and some very interesting contests should be forthcoming.<br />\nMEDALS RECEIVED<br />\n<br />\nThe silver medals offered by the<br />\nSouthern Lacrosse Leagues for the<br />\nwinning team in the intercollegiate<br />\ncontests won for the fourth consecutive time have arrived and have been<br />\ngiven to the following members of the<br />\nteam:<br />\nFrank (captain), Schmeisser, H.,<br />\nChesney, Gutman, Lowndes, Stockett,<br />\nKeith, Klein, Breyer, Schmeisser,<br />\nClary, Williams.<br />\n<br />\nSaturday afternoon the annual indoor track meet between the two underclasses was held in the Cage and<br />\nresulted in an overwhelming victory<br />\nfor the second year class. The final<br />\nscore gave the sophomores 44 points<br />\nagainst the 28 scored by the youngster<br />\nclass. In three of the events, the<br />\nmile run, the 88o-yard run, and the<br />\nhigh jump the first three places were<br />\nall members of the second year class.<br />\nThe individual stars of the games<br />\nwere Freddie Lee for the sophomores<br />\nand Novack for the freshmen. Lee<br />\nliterally walked away with the mile<br />\nrun, lapping all the freshman entries.<br />\nIn the 88o he won by a narrow margin from Schmeisser, who collapsed<br />\njust as he was breasting the tape. He<br />\nalso won second in the pole vault,<br />\ngiving him a total of 13 points won<br />\nfor his class.<br />\nThe \"Freshman Giant,\"Novack, was<br />\nthe biggest individual point winner,<br />\nas he captured the pole vault, the shot<br />\nput and the broad jump, three firsts,<br />\nor 15 points to his credit. Fulton won<br />\n6 points for 1912 and Pieper's efforts<br />\nadded 7 to the total of the new class.<br />\nOne of the most exciting events of<br />\nthe afternoon was the 30-yard dash,<br />\nwhich was so close that many thought<br />\nit was a dead heat, but the decision<br />\nwas in favor of Pieper over Todes_<br />\nDuring the games the sophomores<br />\ncreated a diversion by singing some<br />\nof their songs: \"We Have Sand in<br />\nOur Make-up,\" \"The Clerk of Oxenford,\" and \"The Old White Goose.\"<br />\nThere was a large crowd of rooters<br />\nfrom both the classes, and many of<br />\nthe old grads came up to see the<br />\nevents.

Furthermore, there has been a great deal<br />\nof difficulty caused by the non-payment, on the part of some, of the<br />\nmoney due on the dance in December. The committee goes to no little trouble to make these dances successful, and there is no reason why<br />\nhose who attended should cause further difficulty because of delay in<br />\npaying their dues. In consideration<br />\nof this fact, the club has felt justified in passing the following rule,<br />\nwhich will be strictly enforced in all<br />\ncases: namely, that no person will<br />\nbe admitted unless he has a card of<br />\nadmission from the Cotillon Club, and<br />\nthat no cards will be issued to anyone who has not paid his back debts<br />\nand the dues for the dance which he<br />\nis to attend.<br />\n<br />\nSUBSCRIPTIONS:<br />\n1.50 per year.<br />\n5 cents per copy.<br />\nPublished weekly from October to<br />\nJune by the undergraduates of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nBusiness communications should be<br />\naddressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER;<br />\nal/ articles and other communications<br />\nrigouid be sent to the EDITCR-IN-CHIEF.<br />\nApplication for entry as Seconaclass mail matter at Baltimore pending.<br />\n<br />\nEditor-in-Chief:<br />\nGeorge Ross Veazey, '10.<br />\nAssistant Editors:<br />\nEdward Duffield Martin, 'II.<br />\nNathan Williams Haynes, '12.<br />\nTheodore S.

In an<br />\narticle published in the last issue of<br />\nThe News-Letter the writer urges<br />\nthe necessity of college students'<br />\nposting themselves on the literature<br />\nof today, as well as on that of the<br />\nday before yesterday. It is true<br />\nthat Kipling's works are not \"taught\"<br />\nat the University, but we trust that<br />\nthis does not prevent the appearance<br />\nof his books on the library's shelves.<br />\nThe News-Letter, although published by an undergraduate editorial<br />\nstaff, is a college weekly whose sphere<br />\nof usefulness extends to the graduate<br />\nstudents, and from them asks the<br />\nsame support which it receives from<br />\nthe undergraduate body. The venture of changing the character of the<br />\npublication to a weekly newspaper<br />\nwas by no means a small one, and<br />\nhas thus far been attended by a reasonable degree of success. There is,<br />\nof course, a great deal of room for<br />\nimprovement, and suggestions as to<br />\nthe general character of the paper,<br />\nor details of its organization, will be<br />\nwelcomed.

I must confess that when I<br />\nwas asked this question I disregarded Mark Twain's famous words,<br />\n\"When in doubt, tell the truth,\" and<br />\ntook shelter in evasions. If I had<br />\nfollowed the advice of the humorist<br />\nI should have replied that I did not<br />\nknow, and, as this letter is a confession as well as a suggestion, I am<br />\nobliged to say that I was ashamed of<br />\nmy ignorance. I might add, too,<br />\nthat I am willing to wager that there<br />\nare not two dozen students in the<br />\nUniversity who could have enlightened me. Only after careful consideration have I reached the conclusion that Hopkins has not an<br />\nAlma Mater Song; indeed, it has<br />\nnothing vaguely approaching it.<br />\nTrue, we have songs\u2014songs that<br />\nwould be a credit to any university,<br />\nand this fact makes it doubly strange<br />\nthat no one has ariun_to give us<br />\nsomething<br />\nthat could stand beside the most cherished products of<br />\nYale and Harvard and Princeton.<br />\nAt these institutions the Alma Mater<br />\nSong is the most impressive feature<br />\nof every college event and one who<br />\nhas seen thousands of men spring to<br />\ntheir feet and doff their hats while<br />\nthe notes of the well known melody<br />\npoured from their throats never forget, the inspiring sight. Here at<br />\nHopkins it is unknown.<br />\nA fellow-student has suggested to<br />\nme that the University Ode might<br />\nbe considered the Alma Mater Song.<br />\nI have met few Hopkins men who<br />\ncould recite Mr. Devries' admirable<br />\nlines, and I have never heard an attempt at singing them that has not<br />\nbeen extremely painful. This fact<br />\nbrings home to us with convincing<br />\nforce the realization that the Ode<br />\ndoes not meet the requirements of<br />\nan Alma Mater Song, whose music<br />\nshould be as stately as that of \"My<br />\nMaryland\" and as inspiring as that<br />\nof \"Dixie.\"<br />\nWe have abundant material at<br />\nthis University upon which to build<br />\na song as immortal as the name of<br />\nHopkins is destined to become. An<br />\ninstitution \"mighty in its youth,\"<br />\nwith a glorious past and, as we have<br />\nreason to believe, a still more glorious future deserves a song that will<br />\nembody the pride and hope of its loyal graduates and students. Where is<br />\nthe man who will write it?<br />\nStudent.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\nWANTS TENNIS TOURNAMENT<br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter,<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nThrough your columns I would<br />\nlike to urge the formation of an annual Hopkins Tennis Tournament.<br />\nThere are a great many men at Hopkins who do not play lacrosse, and<br />\nwould like to have a tournament. This<br />\nwas proved last year when the Freshman Class held a tournament in which<br />\nthere were twenty-one entries out of<br />\na class of fifty. This was larger than<br />\neither the football or lacrosse squads.<br />\nAnd if the Athletic Association will<br />\nonly do the decent thing toward this<br />\ngame there is no reason why we<br />\nshould not get up a good University<br />\nteam; as St. John's is very anxious<br />\nto have a match.<br />\nIf the Athletic Association would<br />\nappropriate seventy-five dollars,which<br />\nis very small in comparison to the<br />\nsum which it spends on Track, Football, Lacrosse\u2014toward. a tournament<br />\nthis spring, we could make the entry<br />\nfee sufficiently low to allow everyone<br />\nto go into it.<br />\nAnd as it has already been decided<br />\nto have sophomore and freshman tennis tournaments I see no reason why<br />\nwe should not have a freshman-sophomore tournament, to take the place<br />\nof the inter-class lacrosse games<br />\nwhich will not be played this year.<br />\nIn conclusion I would urge upon<br />\neveryone interested in tennis to make<br />\nit a point to see personally his class<br />\ndelegate to the Athletic Association<br />\nand as his representative have it pushed forward at the next meeting.<br />\nAnd who knows, if they do the<br />\nright thing by us, we may some day<br />\nhave a team to go up to the intercollegiates.<br />\nThanking you for the space allowed me, I am,<br />\nYours truly,<br />\nStudent.<br />\nMr. Dana Durand will address the<br />\nHistorical and Political Science Association next Friday evening on<br />\n\"The Taking of the Census.\" Mr.<br />\nDurand is the Director of the Census.<br />\n111111111=11111111\u20221111111MIIIMMENR<br />\nFrank Saiontz, '09, died Wednesday afternoon at the City Hospital<br />\nfrom heart trouble.

It was one of importance because the question of the<br />\nProm, during senior week was discussed. The Senior Class being<br />\nnumerically very small, asked the<br />\nJunior class to establish the precedent of giving the seniors a Prom.<br />\nat the end of the year. After some<br />\nlittle discussion on the subject, a<br />\ncommittee was appointed to confer<br />\nwith the president of the Sophomore<br />\nClass as to their willingness to establish this custom in the future.<br />\nA banquet committee, consisting<br />\nof R.

In the<br />\nregistration folder, was the Convention hymnal, program of the various<br />\nmeetings, and a card of introduction<br />\nto your hostess. The High School<br />\nboys acted as guides and were very<br />\nobliging in taking their delegates to<br />\n'the various sections of the city.<br />\nThe convention opened on Wednesday afternoon and continued<br />\nwithout interruption until Sunday<br />\nr<br />\nnight.<br />\nOn Thursday morning, Mr. John<br />\nR. Mott, the General Secretary of<br />\nWorld's Christian Student Federation, gave a report of the last four<br />\nyears of the Student Volunteer<br />\nMovement. His report showed that<br />\nover 1200 volunteers had sailed in<br />\nthe last four years, as compared<br />\nwith 1,000 in the previous four.<br />\nOn Thursday afternoon, the secthe<br />\ntional conferences discussed<br />\nneeds of the various countries, and<br />\nmany helpful suggestions were given<br />\nThe<br />\nthe prospective missionaries.<br />\nneed in Japan was for evangelistic<br />\nand educational work.

They<br />\ndo not affect the varsity, which is, as<br />\nusual, going to add another championship banner to our Trophy Room<br />\ncollection, but they have, nevertheless, an important bearing upon the<br />\nsport.<br />\nLast year a local lacrosse league<br />\nwas formed: composed of ova sophomore and freshmen teams, Baltimore<br />\nCity College, and the Mt. Washington Juniors. This year the Friends'<br />\nSchool has been admitted and there is<br />\nsome talk of a team from Polytechnic.<br />\nThe Hopkins Team of 1902 has in<br />\nthe past offered prizes of cups or<br />\nmedals to the members of the team<br />\nwhich should win two games in a<br />\nseries of three between the sophomores and freshmen. This year, however, these prizes are to be offered<br />\nto the winner in this new league, and<br />\nit is somewhat doubtful whether or<br />\nnot the inter-class games will be held.<br />\nIn view of the fact that varsity<br />\nmen cannot be used in the games of<br />\nthis league, the two under classes arz<br />\nplanning to combine forces and enter<br />\nbut one joint team. This under-class<br />\nteam will be lead by Max Paulus,<br />\nthe sophomore captain, and its manager will be James Easter.<br />\nThe object in extending the competition for the 1902 prizes has been<br />\nthat it will have a healthful influence<br />\niipon lacrosse in Baltimore and,by enlivening the interest in the game<br />\namong the schools, help in training<br />\nVoys\u2014some of whom are sure to<br />\ncome to Hopkins\u2014in the sport. The<br />\nmembers of the League are raising<br />\nmoney among themselves to buy some<br />\nprizes for the team which will finish<br />\nsecond in the series. The future of<br />\nthis new lacrosse organization looks<br />\nvery bright, and some very interesting contests should be forthcoming.<br />\nMEDALS RECEIVED<br /><br />\nThe silver medals offered by the<br />\nSouthern Lacrosse Leagues for the<br />\nwinning team in the intercollegiate<br />\ncontests won for the fourth consecutive time have arrived and have been<br />\ngiven to the following members of the<br />\nteam:<br />\nFrank (captain), Schmeisser, H.,<br />\nChesney, Gutman, Lowndes, Stockett,<br />\nKeith, Klein, Breyer, Schmeisser,<br />\nClary, Williams.<br /><br />\nSaturday afternoon the annual indoor track meet between the two underclasses was held in the Cage and<br />\nresulted in an overwhelming victory<br />\nfor the second year class. The final<br />\nscore gave the sophomores 44 points<br />\nagainst the 28 scored by the youngster<br />\nclass. In three of the events, the<br />\nmile run, the 88o-yard run, and the<br />\nhigh jump the first three places were<br />\nall members of the second year class.<br />\nThe individual stars of the games<br />\nwere Freddie Lee for the sophomores<br />\nand Novack for the freshmen. Lee<br />\nliterally walked away with the mile<br />\nrun, lapping all the freshman entries.<br />\nIn the 88o he won by a narrow margin from Schmeisser, who collapsed<br />\njust as he was breasting the tape. He<br />\nalso won second in the pole vault,<br />\ngiving him a total of 13 points won<br />\nfor his class.<br />\nThe \"Freshman Giant,\"Novack, was<br />\nthe biggest individual point winner,<br />\nas he captured the pole vault, the shot<br />\nput and the broad jump, three firsts,<br />\nor 15 points to his credit. Fulton won<br />\n6 points for 1912 and Pieper's efforts<br />\nadded 7 to the total of the new class.<br />\nOne of the most exciting events of<br />\nthe afternoon was the 30-yard dash,<br />\nwhich was so close that many thought<br />\nit was a dead heat, but the decision<br />\nwas in favor of Pieper over Todes_<br />\nDuring the games the sophomores<br />\ncreated a diversion by singing some<br />\nof their songs: \"We Have Sand in<br />\nOur Make-up,\" \"The Clerk of Oxenford,\" and \"The Old White Goose.\"<br />\nThere was a large crowd of rooters<br />\nfrom both the classes, and many of<br />\nthe old grads came up to see the<br />\nevents.

Furthermore, there has been a great deal<br />\nof difficulty caused by the non-payment, on the part of some, of the<br />\nmoney due on the dance in December. The committee goes to no little trouble to make these dances successful, and there is no reason why<br />\nhose who attended should cause further difficulty because of delay in<br />\npaying their dues. In consideration<br />\nof this fact, the club has felt justified in passing the following rule,<br />\nwhich will be strictly enforced in all<br />\ncases: namely, that no person will<br />\nbe admitted unless he has a card of<br />\nadmission from the Cotillon Club, and<br />\nthat no cards will be issued to anyone who has not paid his back debts<br />\nand the dues for the dance which he<br />\nis to attend.<br /><br />\nSUBSCRIPTIONS:<br />\n1.50 per year.<br />\n5 cents per copy.<br />\nPublished weekly from October to<br />\nJune by the undergraduates of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nBusiness communications should be<br />\naddressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER;<br />\nal/ articles and other communications<br />\nrigouid be sent to the EDITCR-IN-CHIEF.<br />\nApplication for entry as Seconaclass mail matter at Baltimore pending.<br /><br />\nEditor-in-Chief:<br />\nGeorge Ross Veazey, '10.<br />\nAssistant Editors:<br />\nEdward Duffield Martin, 'II.<br />\nNathan Williams Haynes, '12.<br />\nTheodore S.

In an<br />\narticle published in the last issue of<br />\nThe News-Letter the writer urges<br />\nthe necessity of college students'<br />\nposting themselves on the literature<br />\nof today, as well as on that of the<br />\nday before yesterday. It is true<br />\nthat Kipling's works are not \"taught\"<br />\nat the University, but we trust that<br />\nthis does not prevent the appearance<br />\nof his books on the library's shelves.<br />\nThe News-Letter, although published by an undergraduate editorial<br />\nstaff, is a college weekly whose sphere<br />\nof usefulness extends to the graduate<br />\nstudents, and from them asks the<br />\nsame support which it receives from<br />\nthe undergraduate body. The venture of changing the character of the<br />\npublication to a weekly newspaper<br />\nwas by no means a small one, and<br />\nhas thus far been attended by a reasonable degree of success. There is,<br />\nof course, a great deal of room for<br />\nimprovement, and suggestions as to<br />\nthe general character of the paper,<br />\nor details of its organization, will be<br />\nwelcomed. Among the graduate students registered in courses here there<br />\nare undoubtedly many who in their<br />\ncollege days edited papers of a similar scope and aim. From these The<br />\nNews-Letter especially desires suggestions or personal conferences.<br />\nEvery student who has any ideas<br />\nwhatever concerning the editing of<br />\na college daily, should communicate<br />\nwith the editorial board, and thus<br />\nhelp in making The News-Letter a<br />\nstudent publication commensurate in<br />\nle!ative greatness with the fame of<br />\n_Tohns Hopkins as a university.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS-LEMMERT<br />\nBOTH STAND ON A HIGH PLANE<br />\nSTUDENTS WEARING LEMMERT CLOTHES SET THE PACE<br />\nOF WELL-DRESSED MEN<br />\nOUR PRICES ARE REASONABLE ENOUGH TO PLEASE YOU :::<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br />\nIQ EAST FAYETTE STREET<br />\nBOOKS! \u2022<br /><br />\nSECOND-HAND!<br /><br />\nSchool, Medical and Miscellaneous,<br />\nBought, Sold and Exchanged<br /><br />\nILGENFRITZ STUDIO<br />\nARTISTIC PPHOTOGRAPHS<br /><br />\nPIPPEN'S BOOK STORE<br />\n6o5 North Eutaw Street,<br />\nNear the University<br />\nBALTIMORE'S LARGEST OLD BOOK STORE<br /><br />\nRHODES SCHOLARSHIP<br />\nAWARDED<br /><br />\nSUCCESSOR TO CUMMINS<br /><br />\n319 North Charles Street<br /><br />\nSpecial Discovnt to Student,<br /><br />\nHands off cheap gloves if<br />\nyou want well-gloved<br />\nhands.

I must confess that when I<br />\nwas asked this question I disregarded Mark Twain's famous words,<br />\n\"When in doubt, tell the truth,\" and<br />\ntook shelter in evasions. If I had<br />\nfollowed the advice of the humorist<br />\nI should have replied that I did not<br />\nknow, and, as this letter is a confession as well as a suggestion, I am<br />\nobliged to say that I was ashamed of<br />\nmy ignorance. I might add, too,<br />\nthat I am willing to wager that there<br />\nare not two dozen students in the<br />\nUniversity who could have enlightened me. Only after careful consideration have I reached the conclusion that Hopkins has not an<br />\nAlma Mater Song; indeed, it has<br />\nnothing vaguely approaching it.<br />\nTrue, we have songs\u2014songs that<br />\nwould be a credit to any university,<br />\nand this fact makes it doubly strange<br />\nthat no one has ariun_to give us<br />\nsomething<br />\nthat could stand beside the most cherished products of<br />\nYale and Harvard and Princeton.<br />\nAt these institutions the Alma Mater<br />\nSong is the most impressive feature<br />\nof every college event and one who<br />\nhas seen thousands of men spring to<br />\ntheir feet and doff their hats while<br />\nthe notes of the well known melody<br />\npoured from their throats never forget, the inspiring sight. Here at<br />\nHopkins it is unknown.<br />\nA fellow-student has suggested to<br />\nme that the University Ode might<br />\nbe considered the Alma Mater Song.<br />\nI have met few Hopkins men who<br />\ncould recite Mr. Devries' admirable<br />\nlines, and I have never heard an attempt at singing them that has not<br />\nbeen extremely painful. This fact<br />\nbrings home to us with convincing<br />\nforce the realization that the Ode<br />\ndoes not meet the requirements of<br />\nan Alma Mater Song, whose music<br />\nshould be as stately as that of \"My<br />\nMaryland\" and as inspiring as that<br />\nof \"Dixie.\"<br />\nWe have abundant material at<br />\nthis University upon which to build<br />\na song as immortal as the name of<br />\nHopkins is destined to become. An<br />\ninstitution \"mighty in its youth,\"<br />\nwith a glorious past and, as we have<br />\nreason to believe, a still more glorious future deserves a song that will<br />\nembody the pride and hope of its loyal graduates and students. Where is<br />\nthe man who will write it?<br />\nStudent.<br /><br />\n5<br />\nWANTS TENNIS TOURNAMENT<br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter,<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nThrough your columns I would<br />\nlike to urge the formation of an annual Hopkins Tennis Tournament.<br />\nThere are a great many men at Hopkins who do not play lacrosse, and<br />\nwould like to have a tournament. This<br />\nwas proved last year when the Freshman Class held a tournament in which<br />\nthere were twenty-one entries out of<br />\na class of fifty. This was larger than<br />\neither the football or lacrosse squads.<br />\nAnd if the Athletic Association will<br />\nonly do the decent thing toward this<br />\ngame there is no reason why we<br />\nshould not get up a good University<br />\nteam; as St. John's is very anxious<br />\nto have a match.<br />\nIf the Athletic Association would<br />\nappropriate seventy-five dollars,which<br />\nis very small in comparison to the<br />\nsum which it spends on Track, Football, Lacrosse\u2014toward. a tournament<br />\nthis spring, we could make the entry<br />\nfee sufficiently low to allow everyone<br />\nto go into it.<br />\nAnd as it has already been decided<br />\nto have sophomore and freshman tennis tournaments I see no reason why<br />\nwe should not have a freshman-sophomore tournament, to take the place<br />\nof the inter-class lacrosse games<br />\nwhich will not be played this year.<br />\nIn conclusion I would urge upon<br />\neveryone interested in tennis to make<br />\nit a point to see personally his class<br />\ndelegate to the Athletic Association<br />\nand as his representative have it pushed forward at the next meeting.<br />\nAnd who knows, if they do the<br />\nright thing by us, we may some day<br />\nhave a team to go up to the intercollegiates.<br />\nThanking you for the space allowed me, I am,<br />\nYours truly,<br />\nStudent.<br />\nMr. Dana Durand will address the<br />\nHistorical and Political Science Association next Friday evening on<br />\n\"The Taking of the Census.\" Mr.<br />\nDurand is the Director of the Census.<br />\n111111111=11111111\u20221111111MIIIMMENR<br />\nFrank Saiontz, '09, died Wednesday afternoon at the City Hospital<br />\nfrom heart trouble.
