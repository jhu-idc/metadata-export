However,<br />\nthe resolution states that Cowlcil \"firmly believes that some<br />\nmore immediate action is needed.\" The resolution goes on to<br />\n<br />\nassert that \"Council will gladly appoint representatives to a<br />\ncommittee which w ill formulate<br />\na plan for this definite and immediate action, if and when<br />\nsuch a committee is formed.\"<br />\nAccording to the Transit and<br />\nTraffic Department plan, the<br />\nsingle southbound lane will be<br />\nclosed at all times except morning rush hour and during<br />\nstadium events.

Ms.<br />\nLong spoke on the video age<br />\nand education, drawing on personal as well as professional<br />\nexperiences.<br />\nCo-chairman of the symposium Michael Washburn<br />\nblamed the low attendance on<br />\na \"lack of publicity..,most of'<br />\nthe publicity was done here at<br />\nHopkins through postering and<br />\nthe News-Letter. Unfortunately, students at Hopkins tend to<br />\nlook down somewhat on someone who appears on Sesame<br />\nStreet and not realize that she<br />\nmay have intellectual attributes<br />\nas well...the problem with last<br />\nyear's symposium was that it<br />\n<br />\n1.oretta Long's Sesame Street image<br />\nfailed to attract large crowds.<br />\n<br />\nwasn't entertaining enough. We<br />\nfelt that Ms. Long would be<br />\nsuitable, first of all, because she<br />\nis an entertainer, and secondly,<br />\nbecause she has experience in<br />\ndirectly using the media for<br />\neducation.\"<br />\nMs. Long advocated the use<br />\nof television as a powerful<br />\neducational tool, yet realizes its<br />\nhazards. \"I do believe that<br />\n<br />\nwithout TV news and information programming we would<br />\nProbably be less informed as a<br />\ncitizenry than we are. So we<br />\nneed to figure out how best to<br />\nuse the television media for our<br />\nown educational purposes...this<br />\nis really the backbone of the<br />\nthinking that went into<br />\ndeveloping Sesame Street. She<br />\nalso said that \"Television in the<br />\nhands of a child is very much<br />\nlike a book of matches, and<br />\nthat we need to be more in control of the messages a child<br />\nreceives.\"<br />\nAccording to Ms. Long,<br />\nthese goals are best achieved by<br />\na grass roots agency, such as<br />\nAction for Children's Television (ACT), rather than .the<br />\ngovernment or individuals.<br />\n\"What I would really like is to<br />\nhave the producers and writers<br />\nhave more conscience about<br />\nwhat it is they really write.\" But<br />\nthe only real protection that excon!. on p. 2<br />\n<br />\nLana insisted that the road's<br />\nconstruction, with three northbound lanes running alongside<br />\none southbound lane, makes<br />\ncrossing particularly hazardous. He claims that people<br />\ncrossing the street tend to watch<br />\nonly the northbound traffic,<br />\nforgettine that which is coming<br />\nfrom the one odd lane. He<br />\nclaimed that if there were two<br />\nnorthbound and two southbound lanes the problem would<br />\nnot be as bad as it is now.<br />\nCity Councilwoman Mary<br />\nPat Clarke told Lana that \"I'm<br />\non your side,\" and suggested<br />\nthat she would be in favor of a<br />\nspecific proposal which will address the concerns of all involved. \"It seems to me,\" she told<br />\nthe New.s.-Leiler , \"that it<br />\nwould make more sense to<br />\nchange the traffic lights than<br />\nreverse lanes of traffic.\" Clarke<br />\nalso said that there were other<br />\nproblem intersections in<br />\nCharles Village, such as Charles<br />\nand 29th Streets, which should<br />\nbe investigated.<br />\n<br />\n\"I saw the nose of the car go<br />\ndown just before it hit her.

There have already been three serious<br />\npedestrian accidents around campus, two of<br />\nthem on Charles Street. The most serious of<br />\nthe three accidents occurred on Wednesday<br />\nafternoon.

The \"walk\" signals are<br />\nonly lit for short periods of time, inducing<br />\npedestrians to take chances crossing against<br />\nthe lights. The peculiar layout of the lanes<br />\nand the poor coordination of the traffic<br />\nlights make timing the breaks in traffic very<br />\ndifficult. Although the speed limit is 25 miles<br />\nper hour, the traffic signals are designed to<br />\npermit speeds of up to 40. Clearly, the street<br />\nis unsafe.

The Democrats<br />\nblame Reagan for the poor<br />\nstate of the economy, particularly the high unemployment figures. They would like<br />\nthe election to be a referendum<br />\nby which the public would<br />\nregister its discontent with<br />\nReagan and vote Democratic.<br />\nReagan, on the other hand, accepts no blame for the<br />\neconomic situation. He contitiues to blame past_ad.-.<br />\nministrations and Democratic<br />\nhouses for present economic<br />\nproblems. He claims he inherited the situation, is making<br />\nsome progress, and that<br />\nAmericans must \"stay the<br />\ncourse.\"<br />\nReagan's claims have some<br />\nvalidity. The rhetoric of some<br />\nDemocrats, however, is<br />\nhypocritical. Reagan's tax and<br />\nspending cuts had substantial<br />\nDemocratic support. The<br />\nDemocrats who voted for those<br />\nbills are as responsible for their<br />\npassage and consequences as<br />\nany strong conservative<br />\nRepublican. These Democrats<br />\nshould be held as accountable<br />\nas Reagan for the recession and<br />\nhigh unemployment. They are<br />\nequally responsible for the<br />\nlower inflation and interest<br />\nrates. For these congressmen<br />\nand senators to now claim that<br />\nthe economic troubles are due<br />\nto Reagan, and that the solution lies with the Democratic<br />\nparty, is untenable.<br />\nThey claim that Reagan had<br />\na mandate, and that they were<br />\nForced to let him have his way.<br />\nThis may be true, but it does<br />\nnot free them from their<br />\nresponsibility for their actions<br />\nin Congress. If the economy<br />\nhad rebounded strongly, these<br />\nDemocrats surely would have<br />\nclaimed some responsibility for<br />\nthe hi-partisan success. Well,<br />\nthey cannot absolve themselves<br />\nof responsibility simply because<br />\nthey are dissatisfied with the<br />\nresults.<br />\nSome, like Tip O'Neil, were<br />\nopposed to Reaganomics in<br />\nprinciple, but decided not to<br />\nfight it too strongly. Rather,<br />\nthey hoped it would fail, and<br />\nwould anxiously await the next<br />\n<br />\nelection. That may be a clever<br />\npolitical tactic, but what about<br />\nthe public interest? What about<br />\nthee. Democrats fighting<br />\nstrongly for what they felt was<br />\nbest for their constituents?

I grew up in the<br />\nsuburbs of Queens, New York, where<br />\ndiners were part of everyday life and<br />\ntaken ;or granted. The Silver Moon<br />\nDiner was where my mother always<br />\ntook me after doctor's appointments.<br />\nWhen I worked summers at the XActo Knife Company in Lang Island<br />\nCity, New York, every week included at least one or two trips to Thompson Diner, where we always joked<br />\nthat the food had to be lood since<br />\nthere were so many flies. Probably<br />\nthe most popular high school<br />\nhangout was the Seville Diner on<br />\n\u2022 Northern Boulevard. Diners were<br />\neverywhere. Admittedly, as my love<br />\nfor diners grew ; had to travel further to find the really old ones, which<br />\noften entailed midnight trips to the<br />\ngreat Diner Mecca: New Jersey. Yet<br />\nstandard bona-tide diners were never<br />\nfar away, nor were they anything particularly special.<br />\nI had a shock when I came to<br />\nMaryland. Where were the diners?<br />\nBy the start of my junior year at<br />\nHopkins I had onlyiseen one bona<br />\ntide diner here, and I do look out for<br />\nthem. When I heard triat the movie<br />\nDiner was bi- Mg made and that the<br />\nsetting of the film was Baltimore, it.<br />\nstri,ck me<br />\nvery ironic. I figured<br />\nthat Marylaiid had to have diners<br />\nhiding somewhere, so I made a concerted effort to find them. After<br />\nalmost a year of searching, I think<br />\nI've found most of them and I am<br />\nhappy to say that although Maryland<br />\ndoesn't have a lot of diners, there are<br />\nsome pretty good ones. For those<br />\ndiner lovers who, like myself. have<br />\nhad difficulty finding Maryland's<br />\ndiners, this pirtial list should be of<br />\nsome'help.<br />\nMaryland diners fall into three<br />\nbasic categories. There are the<br />\nspacious, modern, almost-resteui-ant<br />\ntypes that you would feel comfortable visiting with your mom (or if<br />\nyou're older, with the grandchildren).<br />\n<br />\nwere built during the Golden Age of<br />\nDiners to meet the boom of postwar<br />\nprosperity. Customers are more likely<br />\nto be truckers and travellers,<br />\nalthough families will not feel out of<br />\nplace. These diners are characterized<br />\nby the overwhelming abundance of<br />\nstainless steel, both inside and out.<br />\nThe counters generally run the entire<br />\nlength of the room (the Double T is<br />\nan exception), and the corners of the<br />\nbuilding are rounded. While the food<br />\nand prices in these diners are slightly<br />\nbetter than the more modern diners,<br />\nit is the true diner atmosphere that<br />\nmakes them worth visiting.<br />\nMaryland seems to have a penchant for several diners sharing the<br />\nsame name. There are two Double T<br />\nPhoto, 1\u201d M. 11:nid Smith<br />\nvariety.<br />\ndiners and three Tastee diners.

In 1946, Warner bought<br />\nthe Tastee Diner that still stands in<br />\nSilver Spring. Except for the canopy<br />\nthat encircles the outside of the<br />\nbuilding, the diner has remained<br />\nintact.<br />\nAt one point, Warner owned four<br />\ndiners, including one in Fairfax,<br />\nVirginia.

He passed away many years<br />\nago, and the new owner purchased<br />\nthe diner in Laurel which he renamed Tastee Diner, thereby accounting<br />\nfor the three Tastee Diners in<br />\nMaryland today.<br />\nWhile the Bethesda and Silver<br />\nSpring Tastee Diners, along with the<br />\nOverlea Diner on Belair Road, most<br />\nclosely fit the third category of diners<br />\nI have devised, there are several<br />\nothers which are much more<br />\nrepresentative of the small, cheap,<br />\ngreasy, pre-stainless steel type.

Well, even if you<br />\nhaven't, you're about to find<br />\nout!<br />\nThe head coach of the<br />\nHopkins football team is Jerry<br />\nPfeiffer, a 1965 graduate of<br />\nJohns Hopkins. While attending Patterson High School in<br />\nBaltimore, Pfeiffer was an AllState selection in both football<br />\nand lacrosse. He was a varsity<br />\nplayer in both sports at<br />\nHopkins and was an outstanding one at that. He received AllAmerican honors in lacrosse,<br />\nand in football he ranks among<br />\nthe top quarterbacks in<br />\nHopkins history.<br />\nUpon his graduation, Pfeiffer served as a part-time assistant coach at Hopkins, then<br />\nmoved on to coach lacrosse and<br />\nfootball at two local prep<br />\nschools before returning to<br />\nHopkins in 1978 as an assistant<br />\nfootball and lacrosse coach.<br />\nUpon the death of Howdy<br />\nMeyers, Pfeiffer became the<br />\nhead football coach for the<br />\n1980 season.

Aside from this 1977<br />\ngraduate being the dean of the<br />\nfootball team's assistants, he is<br />\nalso the full-time baseball coach<br />\nfor the Blue Jays. He has been<br />\ndoing double duty for the past<br />\nthree years.<br />\n<br />\nBabb was a high school football player and became a<br />\nHopkins assistant after receiving his masters degree from<br />\nMorgan State University.

He attended<br />\nTowson State University, and<br />\nwas twice named MVP of their<br />\nfootball team.

However,<br />\nthe resolution states that Cowlcil \"firmly believes that some<br />\nmore immediate action is needed.\" The resolution goes on to<br /><br />\nassert that \"Council will gladly appoint representatives to a<br />\ncommittee which w ill formulate<br />\na plan for this definite and immediate action, if and when<br />\nsuch a committee is formed.\"<br />\nAccording to the Transit and<br />\nTraffic Department plan, the<br />\nsingle southbound lane will be<br />\nclosed at all times except morning rush hour and during<br />\nstadium events.

Ms.<br />\nLong spoke on the video age<br />\nand education, drawing on personal as well as professional<br />\nexperiences.<br />\nCo-chairman of the symposium Michael Washburn<br />\nblamed the low attendance on<br />\na \"lack of publicity..,most of'<br />\nthe publicity was done here at<br />\nHopkins through postering and<br />\nthe News-Letter. Unfortunately, students at Hopkins tend to<br />\nlook down somewhat on someone who appears on Sesame<br />\nStreet and not realize that she<br />\nmay have intellectual attributes<br />\nas well...the problem with last<br />\nyear's symposium was that it<br /><br />\n1.oretta Long's Sesame Street image<br />\nfailed to attract large crowds.<br /><br />\nwasn't entertaining enough. We<br />\nfelt that Ms. Long would be<br />\nsuitable, first of all, because she<br />\nis an entertainer, and secondly,<br />\nbecause she has experience in<br />\ndirectly using the media for<br />\neducation.\"<br />\nMs. Long advocated the use<br />\nof television as a powerful<br />\neducational tool, yet realizes its<br />\nhazards. \"I do believe that<br /><br />\nwithout TV news and information programming we would<br />\nProbably be less informed as a<br />\ncitizenry than we are. So we<br />\nneed to figure out how best to<br />\nuse the television media for our<br />\nown educational purposes...this<br />\nis really the backbone of the<br />\nthinking that went into<br />\ndeveloping Sesame Street. She<br />\nalso said that \"Television in the<br />\nhands of a child is very much<br />\nlike a book of matches, and<br />\nthat we need to be more in control of the messages a child<br />\nreceives.\"<br />\nAccording to Ms. Long,<br />\nthese goals are best achieved by<br />\na grass roots agency, such as<br />\nAction for Children's Television (ACT), rather than .the<br />\ngovernment or individuals.<br />\n\"What I would really like is to<br />\nhave the producers and writers<br />\nhave more conscience about<br />\nwhat it is they really write.\" But<br />\nthe only real protection that excon!. on p. 2<br /><br />\nLana insisted that the road's<br />\nconstruction, with three northbound lanes running alongside<br />\none southbound lane, makes<br />\ncrossing particularly hazardous. He claims that people<br />\ncrossing the street tend to watch<br />\nonly the northbound traffic,<br />\nforgettine that which is coming<br />\nfrom the one odd lane. He<br />\nclaimed that if there were two<br />\nnorthbound and two southbound lanes the problem would<br />\nnot be as bad as it is now.<br />\nCity Councilwoman Mary<br />\nPat Clarke told Lana that \"I'm<br />\non your side,\" and suggested<br />\nthat she would be in favor of a<br />\nspecific proposal which will address the concerns of all involved. \"It seems to me,\" she told<br />\nthe New.s.-Leiler , \"that it<br />\nwould make more sense to<br />\nchange the traffic lights than<br />\nreverse lanes of traffic.\" Clarke<br />\nalso said that there were other<br />\nproblem intersections in<br />\nCharles Village, such as Charles<br />\nand 29th Streets, which should<br />\nbe investigated.<br /><br />\n\"I saw the nose of the car go<br />\ndown just before it hit her.

At that<br />\ntime, the amendment gave exclusive power to the SAC to<br />\npropose amendments to its constitution. The proposed amendment passed unanimously.<br />\nThat amendment came to the<br />\ncouncil on September 29. It was<br />\nthen defeated on the grounds<br />\nthat it took from the council its<br />\nprerogative to amend the SAC<br />\nconstitution.<br />\nThe defeat angered many<br /><br />\nmembers of the SAC who<br />\nbelieve that the Student Council has been usurping the commission's: reign. During .<br />\nWednesday night's debate,<br />\nGrant Lally, an SAC member,<br />\ntold 'the News-Letter that \"if<br />\nCouncil rejects this amendment, the SAC will vote to<br />\nfreeze its funds.\",<br />\nThe amendment was reintroduced to the SAC Executive<br />\nBoard on October 4.

According to Robert<br />\nFinkel, a member of that<br />\ndelegation, each participant at<br />\nthe convention was assigned to<br />\ngroups that looked into problems encountered by, as well<br />\nas the strengths of, variou.s<br />\nschools. Students would compare ideas as to how these problems were dealt with at the<br />\nSchools in an effort to improve<br />\ntheir treatment of such<br />\nweaknesses.<br />\nGary Millev, another of last<br />\nyear's delegates, said the AAUS<br /><br />\n\"has great poter11a think<br />\ntank.

There have already been three serious<br />\npedestrian accidents around campus, two of<br />\nthem on Charles Street. The most serious of<br />\nthe three accidents occurred on Wednesday<br />\nafternoon.

The \"walk\" signals are<br />\nonly lit for short periods of time, inducing<br />\npedestrians to take chances crossing against<br />\nthe lights. The peculiar layout of the lanes<br />\nand the poor coordination of the traffic<br />\nlights make timing the breaks in traffic very<br />\ndifficult.

The Democrats<br />\nblame Reagan for the poor<br />\nstate of the economy, particularly the high unemployment figures. They would like<br />\nthe election to be a referendum<br />\nby which the public would<br />\nregister its discontent with<br />\nReagan and vote Democratic.<br />\nReagan, on the other hand, accepts no blame for the<br />\neconomic situation. He contitiues to blame past_ad.-.<br />\nministrations and Democratic<br />\nhouses for present economic<br />\nproblems. He claims he inherited the situation, is making<br />\nsome progress, and that<br />\nAmericans must \"stay the<br />\ncourse.\"<br />\nReagan's claims have some<br />\nvalidity. The rhetoric of some<br />\nDemocrats, however, is<br />\nhypocritical. Reagan's tax and<br />\nspending cuts had substantial<br />\nDemocratic support. The<br />\nDemocrats who voted for those<br />\nbills are as responsible for their<br />\npassage and consequences as<br />\nany strong conservative<br />\nRepublican. These Democrats<br />\nshould be held as accountable<br />\nas Reagan for the recession and<br />\nhigh unemployment. They are<br />\nequally responsible for the<br />\nlower inflation and interest<br />\nrates. For these congressmen<br />\nand senators to now claim that<br />\nthe economic troubles are due<br />\nto Reagan, and that the solution lies with the Democratic<br />\nparty, is untenable.<br />\nThey claim that Reagan had<br />\na mandate, and that they were<br />\nForced to let him have his way.<br />\nThis may be true, but it does<br />\nnot free them from their<br />\nresponsibility for their actions<br />\nin Congress. If the economy<br />\nhad rebounded strongly, these<br />\nDemocrats surely would have<br />\nclaimed some responsibility for<br />\nthe hi-partisan success. Well,<br />\nthey cannot absolve themselves<br />\nof responsibility simply because<br />\nthey are dissatisfied with the<br />\nresults.<br />\nSome, like Tip O'Neil, were<br />\nopposed to Reaganomics in<br />\nprinciple, but decided not to<br />\nfight it too strongly. Rather,<br />\nthey hoped it would fail, and<br />\nwould anxiously await the next<br /><br />\nelection. That may be a clever<br />\npolitical tactic, but what about<br />\nthe public interest? What about<br />\nthee. Democrats fighting<br />\nstrongly for what they felt was<br />\nbest for their constituents? Apparently, that was secondary to<br />\ntheir personal ambitions.<br />\nThe only Democrats who can<br />\ndisclaim responsibility are those<br />\nwho opposed and seriously<br />\nfought Reagan down the line.<br />\nThey can legitimately criticize<br />\nReagan and his Republicans, as<br />\nwell as the Democratic supporters of the bills.<br />\nIt is true that one must play<br />\ncertain games to be politically<br /><br />\n*.N.<br /><br />\nMI I HAVE A rAr0-DU 1.110,4 DA y.<br /><br />\nvi- 1-Ti)44 rtE<br />\nmoRROW<br /><br />\nli<br /><br />\nTotiopH41041-.<br /><br />\nI-WYE-ST\\<br /><br />\n---11\"<br />\n41I1E s '<br />\nsuccessful.

I grew up in the<br />\nsuburbs of Queens, New York, where<br />\ndiners were part of everyday life and<br />\ntaken ;or granted. The Silver Moon<br />\nDiner was where my mother always<br />\ntook me after doctor's appointments.<br />\nWhen I worked summers at the XActo Knife Company in Lang Island<br />\nCity, New York, every week included at least one or two trips to Thompson Diner, where we always joked<br />\nthat the food had to be lood since<br />\nthere were so many flies. Probably<br />\nthe most popular high school<br />\nhangout was the Seville Diner on<br />\n\u2022 Northern Boulevard. Diners were<br />\neverywhere. Admittedly, as my love<br />\nfor diners grew ; had to travel further to find the really old ones, which<br />\noften entailed midnight trips to the<br />\ngreat Diner Mecca: New Jersey. Yet<br />\nstandard bona-tide diners were never<br />\nfar away, nor were they anything particularly special.<br />\nI had a shock when I came to<br />\nMaryland. Where were the diners?<br />\nBy the start of my junior year at<br />\nHopkins I had onlyiseen one bona<br />\ntide diner here, and I do look out for<br />\nthem. When I heard triat the movie<br />\nDiner was bi- Mg made and that the<br />\nsetting of the film was Baltimore, it.<br />\nstri,ck me<br />\nvery ironic. I figured<br />\nthat Marylaiid had to have diners<br />\nhiding somewhere, so I made a concerted effort to find them. After<br />\nalmost a year of searching, I think<br />\nI've found most of them and I am<br />\nhappy to say that although Maryland<br />\ndoesn't have a lot of diners, there are<br />\nsome pretty good ones. For those<br />\ndiner lovers who, like myself. have<br />\nhad difficulty finding Maryland's<br />\ndiners, this pirtial list should be of<br />\nsome'help.<br />\nMaryland diners fall into three<br />\nbasic categories. There are the<br />\nspacious, modern, almost-resteui-ant<br />\ntypes that you would feel comfortable visiting with your mom (or if<br />\nyou're older, with the grandchildren).<br /><br />\nwere built during the Golden Age of<br />\nDiners to meet the boom of postwar<br />\nprosperity. Customers are more likely<br />\nto be truckers and travellers,<br />\nalthough families will not feel out of<br />\nplace. These diners are characterized<br />\nby the overwhelming abundance of<br />\nstainless steel, both inside and out.<br />\nThe counters generally run the entire<br />\nlength of the room (the Double T is<br />\nan exception), and the corners of the<br />\nbuilding are rounded. While the food<br />\nand prices in these diners are slightly<br />\nbetter than the more modern diners,<br />\nit is the true diner atmosphere that<br />\nmakes them worth visiting.<br />\nMaryland seems to have a penchant for several diners sharing the<br />\nsame name. There are two Double T<br />\nPhoto, 1\u201d M. 11:nid Smith<br />\nvariety.<br />\ndiners and three Tastee diners.

In 1946, Warner bought<br />\nthe Tastee Diner that still stands in<br />\nSilver Spring. Except for the canopy<br />\nthat encircles the outside of the<br />\nbuilding, the diner has remained<br />\nintact.<br />\nAt one point, Warner owned four<br />\ndiners, including one in Fairfax,<br />\nVirginia. Three of the four still'<br />\noperate. He passed away many years<br />\nago, and the new owner purchased<br />\nthe diner in Laurel which he renamed Tastee Diner, thereby accounting<br />\nfor the three Tastee Diners in<br />\nMaryland today.<br />\nWhile the Bethesda and Silver<br />\nSpring Tastee Diners, along with the<br />\nOverlea Diner on Belair Road, most<br />\nclosely fit the third category of diners<br />\nI have devised, there are several<br />\nothers which are much more<br />\nrepresentative of the small, cheap,<br />\ngreasy, pre-stainless steel type.

Throughout my breakfast, the diner's owner<br />\nMike Passas(who has a heavy Italian<br />\naccent) interrupted me with stories<br />\nabout his diner. At one point he took<br />\nme on a tour of his stockroom, where<br />\nhe showed me his sacks of fresh<br />\npotatoes which he is very proud of.<br />\nHe then showed me the kitchen. This<br />\nwas a big thrill for me as it was my<br />\nfirst time in a diner kitchen. Each<br />\ntime I have returned to the State<br />\nDiner, the waiters and waitresses<br />\nhave been friendly and talkative, and<br />\nthe food has been excellent. One<br />\nthing I especially like about the diner<br />\nis that they assume that when you<br />\ncome in you know what you want.<br /><br />\nFor some reason, I have trouble<br />\ndealing with girls.

Cathy Eddard<br />\nShe worked all day once to make<br />\nthis veal cordon bleu for some special<br />\ndinner that the French Club was having, and my friends and I ate it when<br />\nshe ran next door to borrow<br />\nsomething.

Vickie Belvinter<br />\nMy best friend Ken used to call her<br />\nup every day, listen to her voice, and<br />\nhang up. Then, like a jerk, he told her<br />\nthat I was the one who was d9ine it<br />\nall of the time. Anyhow, she ended<br />\nup going out with. him even though<br />\nI was.the one who really liked her,<br />\nand I swear I never called up to listen<br />\nto her.

For students without<br />\ncars, however, there are some nearby eateries that approximate diners.<br />\nPete's Grille on 32nd Street and<br />\nGreenmount Avenue is like a diner<br />\nwithout booths. As in many old<br />\ndiners, cooking is done behind the<br />\ncounter. The food, particularly the<br />\ndaily specials, is inexpensive and<br />\ngood. Pete's Grille's main attraction,<br />\nhowever, is the Oriole photographs<br />\nthat line the wall behind the counter.<br />\nThe El Paso Cafe, Roland<br />\nRestaurant, and the St. Louis Grill on<br />\nHampden's 36th Street, also serve<br />\ndiner-type food in a diner-type. atmosphere. All are within walking<br />\ndistance.<br />\nHowever, it' you have a car and<br />\nsome time there is nothing like the<br />\nreal thing. A hot roast beef sandwich,<br />\na slice of pie and a cup of coffee served by a burly waitress in the midst of<br />\na sea of stainless steel and chrome<br />\nbeats a Big Mac any day of the week.<br />\nBut don't wait too long. Diners are<br />\nslowly disappearing. Many of the<br />\ndiners that dotted Maryland's roadsides in years gone by are now liquor<br />\nstores, flea markets, or just deserted<br />\nbuildings. Of course, there is no sadder experience than making a trip to<br />\none of your favorite diners only to<br />\nfind it redecorated with a fancy stucco exterior, fountains, archways and<br />\na plush dining room inside, and to be<br />\ngreeted at the door by a smiling<br />\nGreek asking you if you'd like<br />\ncocktails before your dinner.<br /><br />\n9.

Well, even if you<br />\nhaven't, you're about to find<br />\nout!<br />\nThe head coach of the<br />\nHopkins football team is Jerry<br />\nPfeiffer, a 1965 graduate of<br />\nJohns Hopkins. While attending Patterson High School in<br />\nBaltimore, Pfeiffer was an AllState selection in both football<br />\nand lacrosse. He was a varsity<br />\nplayer in both sports at<br />\nHopkins and was an outstanding one at that. He received AllAmerican honors in lacrosse,<br />\nand in football he ranks among<br />\nthe top quarterbacks in<br />\nHopkins history.<br />\nUpon his graduation, Pfeiffer served as a part-time assistant coach at Hopkins, then<br />\nmoved on to coach lacrosse and<br />\nfootball at two local prep<br />\nschools before returning to<br />\nHopkins in 1978 as an assistant<br />\nfootball and lacrosse coach.<br />\nUpon the death of Howdy<br />\nMeyers, Pfeiffer became the<br />\nhead football coach for the<br />\n1980 season. Last year, he led<br />\nthe team to a 7-2 record, which<br />\nties the school's all-time high<br />\nfor victories.<br />\nDefensive coach Robert<br />\nBabb is also a Hopkins<br />\ngraduate. Aside from this 1977<br />\ngraduate being the dean of the<br />\nfootball team's assistants, he is<br />\nalso the full-time baseball coach<br />\nfor the Blue Jays. He has been<br />\ndoing double duty for the past<br />\nthree years.<br /><br />\nBabb was a high school football player and became a<br />\nHopkins assistant after receiving his masters degree from<br />\nMorgan State University.

He attended<br />\nTowson State University, and<br />\nwas twice named MVP of their<br />\nfootball team.
