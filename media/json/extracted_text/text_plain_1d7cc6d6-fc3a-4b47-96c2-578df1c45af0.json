This \"leak\" of electric current, an obstacle to<br />\nlamp perfection, was soon banished by removing more air<br />\nfrom the bulbs.<br />\nBut the ghostly light, and its mysterious disappearance<br />\nin a high vacuum, remained unexplained for years.<br />\nThen J. J. Thomson established the electron theory on<br />\nthe transmission of electricity in a partial vacuum\u2014and<br />\nthe blue light was understood. In a very high vacuum,<br />\nhowever, the light and apparently the currents that<br />\ncaused it disappeared.<br />\nOne day, however, a scientist in the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company proved that a,<br />\ncurrent could be made to pass through the highest possible vacuum, and could be varied according to fixed laws.<br />\nBut the phantom light had vanished.<br />\nHere was a new and definite phenomenon\u2014a basis for<br />\nfurther research.<br />\nImmediately, scientists began a series of developments<br />\nwith far reaching practical results.

But for scientific research, it would have<br />\nbeen forgotten. Yet there is hardly a man, woman or<br />\nchild in the country today whose life has not been benefited, directly or indirectly, by the results of the scientific<br />\ninvestigations that followed.<br />\nThus it is that persistent organized research gives man<br />\nnew tools, makes available forces that otherwise might<br />\nremain unknown for centuries.<br />\n<br />\nGeneral Office<br />\n<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER wishes to<br />\napologize to its readers for the appearance of this issue.

This achievement marked the beginning of<br />\nthecommercialdevelopmentof alternating current<br />\nfor power purposes, and brought the induction<br />\nmotor into a prominence which it has never since<br />\nrelinquished. Great and rapid have been the developments since that day, but the most impressive aspect of this progress is not to be found in<br />\nthe spectacular evidences that are visible to<br />\neveryone, but rather, in the vision and fundamental soundness and determination that have<br />\nbeen quietly at work blazing and clearingthe trails<br />\nwhich the electrical art has followed.<br />\nThere is, for instance, the synchronous converter. This machine is the most efficient and<br />\neconomical means for changing alternating to<br />\ndirect current, which the operation of most<br />\nstreet railway systems and many other processes<br />\nrequire. Without it, the development of alternating current to its present universal usefulness<br />\nwould have been tremendously retarded.<br />\nThe synchronous converter, in its present perfection, is but one of the great contributions to<br />\nelectrical progress that have been made by Benjamin G. Lamme, Chief Engineer of the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company. Mr.<br />\nLamme, in 1891 when he was Chief Designer,<br />\nconceived and developed the converter, which,<br />\nfirst used commercially in connection with the<br />\n<br />\ngreat Niagara power plan, has since come to be<br />\nindispensible to large producers of power.<br />\nWhen a man has played so vital a part in electrical progress that his knowledge and vision<br />\nhave contributed to practically every forward<br />\nengineering step, it is perhaps misleading to attempt to identify him particularly with any one<br />\ndevelopment. His work on the induction motor,<br />\nthe turbo generator, the single-phase railway<br />\nmotor, and the synchronous converter is but<br />\ntypical of the constructive ability which Mr.<br />\nLamme has brought to bear on practically every<br />\nphase of electrical development.<br />\nA man of foresight, visioning the alternatives<br />\nin a problem as well as its hoped-for results. A<br />\nman whose mind combines great power of analysis with the gift of imagination. A prolifictechnical<br />\nwriter, whose style is unequalled in clearness and<br />\nsimplicity of expression. Few engineers so<br />\nthoroughly predetermine the results they actually achieve. Few men capitalize their experiences<br />\nso completely. And few indeed have at once his<br />\nthorough technical equipment, his commercial<br />\nunderstanding, and his broad human interests.<br />\nAn institution which has builded its success<br />\nlargely on engineering achievement pays Benjamin G. Lamme affectionate loyalty and respect.<br />\nThe young engineer on his first job, as well as the<br />\nmost seasoned co-worker, finds in him understanding, sympathy, wise counsel, and a conscienee; to all of which his associates, in preparing this article, are proud to bear witness.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "VOL.

This \"leak\" of electric current, an obstacle to<br />\nlamp perfection, was soon banished by removing more air<br />\nfrom the bulbs.<br />\nBut the ghostly light, and its mysterious disappearance<br />\nin a high vacuum, remained unexplained for years.<br />\nThen J. J. Thomson established the electron theory on<br />\nthe transmission of electricity in a partial vacuum\u2014and<br />\nthe blue light was understood. In a very high vacuum,<br />\nhowever, the light and apparently the currents that<br />\ncaused it disappeared.<br />\nOne day, however, a scientist in the Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company proved that a,<br />\ncurrent could be made to pass through the highest possible vacuum, and could be varied according to fixed laws.<br />\nBut the phantom light had vanished.<br />\nHere was a new and definite phenomenon\u2014a basis for<br />\nfurther research.<br />\nImmediately, scientists began a series of developments<br />\nwith far reaching practical results. A new type of X-ray<br />\ntube, known as the Coolidge tube, soon gave a great impetus to the art of surgery. The Kenotron and Pliotron,<br />\nfollowed in quick succession by the Dynatron and Mag..<br />\nnetron, made possible long distance radio telephony and<br />\nrevolutionized radio telegraphy. And the usefulness of<br />\nthe \"tron\" family has only begun.<br />\nThe troublesome little blue glow was banished nearly<br />\nforty years ago. But for scientific research, it would have<br />\nbeen forgotten. Yet there is hardly a man, woman or<br />\nchild in the country today whose life has not been benefited, directly or indirectly, by the results of the scientific<br />\ninvestigations that followed.<br />\nThus it is that persistent organized research gives man<br />\nnew tools, makes available forces that otherwise might<br />\nremain unknown for centuries.<br /><br />\nGeneral Office<br /><br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER wishes to<br />\napologize to its readers for the appearance of this issue.

This achievement marked the beginning of<br />\nthecommercialdevelopmentof alternating current<br />\nfor power purposes, and brought the induction<br />\nmotor into a prominence which it has never since<br />\nrelinquished. Great and rapid have been the developments since that day, but the most impressive aspect of this progress is not to be found in<br />\nthe spectacular evidences that are visible to<br />\neveryone, but rather, in the vision and fundamental soundness and determination that have<br />\nbeen quietly at work blazing and clearingthe trails<br />\nwhich the electrical art has followed.<br />\nThere is, for instance, the synchronous converter. This machine is the most efficient and<br />\neconomical means for changing alternating to<br />\ndirect current, which the operation of most<br />\nstreet railway systems and many other processes<br />\nrequire. Without it, the development of alternating current to its present universal usefulness<br />\nwould have been tremendously retarded.<br />\nThe synchronous converter, in its present perfection, is but one of the great contributions to<br />\nelectrical progress that have been made by Benjamin G. Lamme, Chief Engineer of the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company. Mr.<br />\nLamme, in 1891 when he was Chief Designer,<br />\nconceived and developed the converter, which,<br />\nfirst used commercially in connection with the<br /><br />\ngreat Niagara power plan, has since come to be<br />\nindispensible to large producers of power.<br />\nWhen a man has played so vital a part in electrical progress that his knowledge and vision<br />\nhave contributed to practically every forward<br />\nengineering step, it is perhaps misleading to attempt to identify him particularly with any one<br />\ndevelopment. His work on the induction motor,<br />\nthe turbo generator, the single-phase railway<br />\nmotor, and the synchronous converter is but<br />\ntypical of the constructive ability which Mr.<br />\nLamme has brought to bear on practically every<br />\nphase of electrical development.<br />\nA man of foresight, visioning the alternatives<br />\nin a problem as well as its hoped-for results. A<br />\nman whose mind combines great power of analysis with the gift of imagination. A prolifictechnical<br />\nwriter, whose style is unequalled in clearness and<br />\nsimplicity of expression. Few engineers so<br />\nthoroughly predetermine the results they actually achieve. Few men capitalize their experiences<br />\nso completely. And few indeed have at once his<br />\nthorough technical equipment, his commercial<br />\nunderstanding, and his broad human interests.<br />\nAn institution which has builded its success<br />\nlargely on engineering achievement pays Benjamin G. Lamme affectionate loyalty and respect.<br />\nThe young engineer on his first job, as well as the<br />\nmost seasoned co-worker, finds in him understanding, sympathy, wise counsel, and a conscienee; to all of which his associates, in preparing this article, are proud to bear witness.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 37587, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "95ec1653-a60f-4f96-902d-33f2767fcdd7", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/12983-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 12983, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "3a899249-15c1-4816-bacd-60bd42bb978f", "url": "/node/12983"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "7c334349-9302-4a2d-a466-fe38619b31f9"}]}
