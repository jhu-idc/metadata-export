B. degree from the Johns<br />\nHopkins University seems to us to<br />\nbe a definitely progressive step.<br />\nAfter several years of observing<br />\nthe present scholastic scheme of the<br />\nCollege of Arts and Sciences, we<br />\narc convinced that our system is<br />\nnot producing as good results as<br />\nsome other system might. Reviewing the proposed plan, it appears to<br />\nus that the faults we discerne in<br />\nthe present arrangement are corrected, and that it embodies several excellent new suggestions.<br />\nWe believe that under the present scheme in the College of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, a man 1s ';i:Jlowcdto<br />\nspend four valuable, creative years<br />\nof his life in too ill-regulated, shortsighted a manner. Withdrawn<br />\nfrom their future world, living in<br />\na scholastic atmosphere, too many<br />\n.students have been allowed to<br />\nshrink from the vitally important<br />\nquestion of what their future occupation shall be. For too many,<br />\nthe four years spent in college have<br />\nbeen ones of delay in making this<br />\nvital decision and they emerge with<br />\nvery little preparation for their<br />\nlife's work. Under the \"New<br />\nPlan\" this condition will, to some<br />\nextent at least, be remedied. By<br />\nthe end of his Sophomore year, a<br />\nstudent must have decided which<br />\nof the three groups of study will<br />\nbest suit him for his post-collegiate<br />\nlife. The fact that this decision<br />\nmust be made between three rather<br />\nspecialized courses of study should<br />\nprove a strong stimulus for serious<br />\nconsideration of the student's qualifications and preferences for his<br />\nfuture occupation.<br />\nAnother evil of the present system is the taking of courses for<br />\n\"credits\" alone. At this University, many students are -taking<br />\ncourses which they find neither<br />\nvaluable nor interesting for the<br />\nsole purpose of securing the credits<br />\nto be gained by taking them. This,<br />\nwe have always felt to be a waste<br />\nof valuable time. Under the \"New<br />\nPlan,\" it seems that this wrong is<br />\nto be righted, as the emphasis formerly placed upon credits will be<br />\ntranslated into emphasis gained in<br />\na definite, related field of subjects.<br />\nFurthermore, it seems to us that<br />\nthe importance to be attached to<br />\nstudent research work will prove<br />\nvaluable in acquainting and impressing the student with his information, while the projected<br />\nyearly comprehensive examinations<br />\nwill make sure that he is retaining<br />\nit.

B. degree from the Johns<br />\nHopkins University seems to us to<br />\nbe a definitely progressive step.<br />\nAfter several years of observing<br />\nthe present scholastic scheme of the<br />\nCollege of Arts and Sciences, we<br />\narc convinced that our system is<br />\nnot producing as good results as<br />\nsome other system might. Reviewing the proposed plan, it appears to<br />\nus that the faults we discerne in<br />\nthe present arrangement are corrected, and that it embodies several excellent new suggestions.<br />\nWe believe that under the present scheme in the College of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, a man 1s ';i:Jlowcdto<br />\nspend four valuable, creative years<br />\nof his life in too ill-regulated, shortsighted a manner. Withdrawn<br />\nfrom their future world, living in<br />\na scholastic atmosphere, too many<br />\n.students have been allowed to<br />\nshrink from the vitally important<br />\nquestion of what their future occupation shall be. For too many,<br />\nthe four years spent in college have<br />\nbeen ones of delay in making this<br />\nvital decision and they emerge with<br />\nvery little preparation for their<br />\nlife's work. Under the \"New<br />\nPlan\" this condition will, to some<br />\nextent at least, be remedied. By<br />\nthe end of his Sophomore year, a<br />\nstudent must have decided which<br />\nof the three groups of study will<br />\nbest suit him for his post-collegiate<br />\nlife. The fact that this decision<br />\nmust be made between three rather<br />\nspecialized courses of study should<br />\nprove a strong stimulus for serious<br />\nconsideration of the student's qualifications and preferences for his<br />\nfuture occupation.<br />\nAnother evil of the present system is the taking of courses for<br />\n\"credits\" alone. At this University, many students are -taking<br />\ncourses which they find neither<br />\nvaluable nor interesting for the<br />\nsole purpose of securing the credits<br />\nto be gained by taking them. This,<br />\nwe have always felt to be a waste<br />\nof valuable time. Under the \"New<br />\nPlan,\" it seems that this wrong is<br />\nto be righted, as the emphasis formerly placed upon credits will be<br />\ntranslated into emphasis gained in<br />\na definite, related field of subjects.<br />\nFurthermore, it seems to us that<br />\nthe importance to be attached to<br />\nstudent research work will prove<br />\nvaluable in acquainting and impressing the student with his information, while the projected<br />\nyearly comprehensive examinations<br />\nwill make sure that he is retaining<br />\nit. For these reasons principally,<br />\nwe feel that the \"New Plan\" will<br />\nprove itself far superior to the one<br />\nit supplants in properly preparing<br />\nstudents of the College of Arts and<br />\nSciences.<br /><br />\nLABOR MOVEMENT GREAT ~<br />\nCHALLENGE TO co LL EGE<br />\nMEN SAYS BLANSHARD<br />\n\u00b7<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\nSTUDENTS I NTERESTED<br />\nIN SUMMER EMPLOYMENT<br /><br />\nJACOB FRIED<br />\nSuits Cleaned and Pressed<br />\nSuits Called for and Delivered<br />\n101 E. 21st Street, Belmont 5501<br /><br />\nInquire at P. 0.

To\u00b7day\"s ship is not only<br />\nswifter but safer and more dependable. Modern<br />\ndepth-sounding devices indicate instantly the height of<br />\nthe ship above the ground surf!3ce. A unique feature<br />\nof General Electric's recently purchased monoplane<br />\nis the almost completely electrified instrument panel.<br /><br />\nW<br /><br />\nThe most recently developed instrument is the sonic<br />\naltimeter, which provides a quick means of indicating<br />\nchanges in height above ground. Sound from an<br /><br />\nFIFTH AVENUE, NEW YOllK.<br /><br />\nintermittently operated air whistle is directed downward. The echo is picked up in a receiving megaphone,<br />\nand the sound is heard through a stethoscope. The<br />\nelapsed time between the sound and the echo<br />\ndetermines the height. Tests show that water, buildings, woods, etc., produce echoes that are different<br />\nand characteristic.<br />\nBesides developing a complete system of aircraft instruments, college-trained General Electric engineers<br />\nhave pioneered in every electrical field-on land, on<br />\nsea, and in the air.<br /><br />\nGENERALflE~ECTRIC<br />\nSALES<br /><br />\nAND<br /><br />\nENGINEERING<br /><br />\nSERVICE<br /><br />\nIN<br /><br />\nPRINCIPAL<br /><br />\nCITIES<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., FEBRUARY 19, 1932<br /><br />\nW~MD.,HOPKINS<br /><br />\nDEBATE HERE<br />\nAT 4P.M~ TODAY<br />\nJays To Defend Cen tralization Of Federal Authority<br />\nAgainst States' Rights<br />\nWASSERMAN, SQUIRE,<br />\nBLATTNER, SPEAKERS<br /><br />\nTudor And Stuart Club Gets<br />\nAdditions To Osler Collection<br /><br />\nSix Candidates To Cotillon Board Named<br />\nTuesday<br /><br />\nSister Of Lady Osler, Founder Of Club At Homewood,<br />\nPresents Photographs, Manuscript Found,<br />\nIn Osler' s.
