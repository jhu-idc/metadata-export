The .first few weeks,<br />\nthe time we of the Hopkins have called the Orientation Period,<br />\nare characterized by constant reminders, warning the verdant<br />\nfreshman not to become a scholastic grind.<br />\nThe adventures of predecessors illustrate just how the experience gained by working on any of the innumerable campus<br />\nactivities will make for a better, more complete man.<br />\nPerhaps the strangest characteristic of these prophetic<br />\nmessages is that they are generally true. There are individuals<br />\nwho find personal success or happiness without a balanced life<br />\nat college; but for the vast majority of students there must be<br />\na harmony that includes the social as well as the academic.<br />\nThe Orientation Week committee has introduced the class<br />\nof '52 to a University that maintains her prestige as an institution<br />\nof learning while still retaining unsophisticated naturalness.<br />\nWhether this is the same University you will find when the<br />\nupper-classmen return is hard to tell. Many times the Hopkins has<br />\nbeen accused of general campus inertia. Usually this cry is most<br />\nprominent when our basketball team is playing Loyola. It is<br />\ntraditional, however, that-in the spring when we make just enough<br />\ngoals to beat Army there is no longer a whisper of inertia. Old<br />\ngrads flock back, undergrads bring their best dates and everybody cheers for \"Dear Old Johnny Hopkins.\"<br />\nFrom time to time the Orientation Week Hopkins will seem<br />\na fantasy. When less than half a clam turns out for a student<br />\ngovernment election, one petition is filed for a class office or two<br />\nstudents are the audience for an inter-collegiate debate, the Hopkins<br />\nthat you have been introduced to will seem to be something<br />\nimaginative H ullabaloo editors re-create.<br />\nLike love and life, the Hopkins will have its big times and its<br />\nfrustrating ones.

I wish to draw your official<br />\nattention to that fact and invite retirement from the University.\"<br />\nIn accordance with his wish the new president of the Hopkins will<br />\ntake office on January 1 of the new year.<br />\nContrar; bhis own admissions of old age the president<br />\nappeared vigorous and strong as he offered his last words to a<br />\nHopkins class. No longer dealing with the controversial subjects<br />\nof world problems (the subjects of his freshman class address<br />\nin both 1946 and 1947) Dr Bowman developed a theme more<br />\ncharacteristic of an educator than a political geographer.<br />\nDisoussing maturity and the complexity of man's place in<br />\nsociety today, Dr. -Bowman presented a realistic evaluation of the<br />\nindividual challenge the members of the class of '52 will face<br />\nas they progress in their intellectual growth at the Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nWhere To Go, What To Do<br />\nWhen Campus Is At Lull<br />\n\"'Where to go and what to do\"<br />\nwhen on campus activities are at<br />\nlull is a particularly perplexing<br />\nproblem for the new college<br />\nstudent.<br />\nHere in Baltimore, the Hopkins<br />\nclass of '52 will find the usual<br />\nrun of cliche off campus activity.<br />\nWhen the text books have been<br />\nput away and you have just been<br />\ninformed that Goucher girls 'are<br />\ndated until three weeks after the<br />\nfirst Friday of the second week in<br />\nMarch you might spend your off<br />\ncampus hours at any one of Baltimore's eight first run theatres<br />\ndown town.<br />\nTheatres Named<br />\nThe Stanley and the Century<br />\nare the largest, the most lnxurious,<br />\nand the most impressive.
