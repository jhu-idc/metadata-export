Eisenhower's Garrett Room<br />\nyesterday.<br />\nHasan Abdel Rahman, director of the<br />\nPalestinian Affairs Center of the League<br />\nof Arab States and chief U.S. spokesman<br />\nfor the PLO, contended that a politieal settlement establishing a self-governed<br />\nPalestinian state is necessary because \"the<br />\nPalestinians cannot defeat the Israelis and<br />\nthe Israelis cannot defeat the Palestinians.\"<br />\nHe claimed that PLO Chairman Yassir<br />\nArafat's recent \"peace\" initiatives are<br />\n\"the only opportunity that presents the<br />\n<br />\nIsraelis with a chance to be a legitimate<br />\npart of the Middle East.\"<br />\nRahman, who hailed Arafat's renunciation of terrorism in November as a \"most<br />\nrevolutionary decision, a bold and<br />\ncourageous step\" signifying a \"maturation<br />\nof thinking\" in the PLO,equated the \"suffering borne by the Palestinian people\"<br />\nduring the Intifada, the Palestinian name<br />\nfor the uprising in Israeli-occupied territories, as being \"more in relative terms<br />\nthan what the United States suffered in<br />\nVietnam.\"<br />\nEmphasizing a need that \"peace be<br />\npredicated on equality and mutual<br />\nrespect,\" he presented Israel with the<br />\nultimatum that it either \"negotiate, or face<br />\na conflict with the entire Arab world.\"<br />\nAccording to Rahman, the Intifada was<br />\na \"Palestinian-Israeli conflict, not an ArabIsraeli one.\" This misconception was the<br />\nreason the Arab world viewed former<br />\n<br />\nAlexia Lennon<br />\n<br />\nPLO representative Hasan Abdel Rahman, professor Robert Freedman, moderator Steven<br />\nDavid, and Israeli professor Shlomo Slonim discussed the Palestinian-Israeli conflict yesterday.<br />\n<br />\nEgyptian President Anwar Sadat as a<br />\n\"traitor\" when he signed the Sinai Accords. In contrast, he said, Arabs view<br />\nArafat as a \"hero\" for trying to reach an<br />\naccord with Israel.<br />\nRahman proposed the establishment of<br />\nan \"international conference in order to<br />\nguarantee rights\" so that a nation with<br />\n\"open borders,\" not a \"Berlin Wall,\"be<br />\nestablished.<br />\nRobert Freedman, professor of political<br />\nscience at Baltimore Hebrew University<br />\nand a supporter of the establishment of a<br />\nPalestinian state, described such a creation<br />\nas the lesser of many evils. He referred to<br />\nseveral Israeli officials, including the chief<br />\nof the Israeli Defense Forces, who advocate a necessity of employing a political<br />\nsolution, rather than a military solution, to<br />\nthe problem.<br />\nFreedman said the establishment of a<br />\nPalestinian state should be based on several<br />\nadditional conditions, however. Freedman<br />\nsaid the PLO should demilitarize the West<br />\nBank and Gaza Strip. He added that the<br />\nPLO should abrogate the Palestinian National Covenant, the PLO constitution,<br />\nwhich contains clauses legitimizing<br />\narmed struggle against Israel, a PLO commitment to the annihilation of Israel, and<br />\nthe creation of a Palestinian state in<br />\npre-1948 boundaries.<br />\nRelating some of the discussions he had<br />\nwith Palestinian leaders during his recent<br />\ntrip to Tunisia, Freedman said an international conference discussing the situation<br />\nmight be fruitful because of a \"willingness<br />\non the part of the PLO leadership to engage<br />\nin detailed discussions with the Israelis, in<br />\nsecret or in public, to work out a<br />\nframework for ratification.\"<br />\nFreedom suggested a \"Benelux\"-type<br />\nsettlement establishing open borders and<br />\ncultural and economic exchange between<br />\nseparate Palestinian and Israeli states. He<br />\n<br />\nfurther challenged Palestinians to \"address<br />\nIsrael directly [without resorting to] a<br />\npolitical end-run by pressuring the U.S.<br />\nand Europeans.\"<br />\nU.S. participation similar to that during<br />\nthe Camp David accords, he continued, is<br />\nnecessary to mediate any negotiations,<br />\nwhile Soviet participation might undermine<br />\nthe spirit of negotiation and heighten superpower tensions.<br />\nShlomo Slonim, professor of International Relations at Hebrew University of<br />\nJerusalem and a supporter of official Israeli<br />\nolicy toward the Intifada, asserted that the<br />\nIsraeli people are the \"one people<br />\nthreatened with annihilation. The Israelis<br />\nwould be willing to grant the Palestinians<br />\nself-determination if they would be willing to recognize Israeli selfdetermination.\"<br />\nSlonim admonished the Palestinians for<br />\n\"speaking in Orwellian double-speak,<br />\neither by word or by deed.\" The PLO, he<br />\nwent on, has continued attacks on Israel's<br />\nnorthern border. When the mayor of<br />\nBethlehem suggested the PLO call a halt<br />\nto the Intifada and Israel negotiate a<br />\npolitical settlement to the crisis, continued<br />\nSlonim, Arafat said, \"Anybody who<br />\nmakes the suggestion of interrupting the Intifada war against Israel will get ten bullets<br />\nin his chest.\"<br />\nRahman later contended that this statement was the result of an \"Israeli propaganda machine.\"<br />\nSlonim passionately pleaded the necessity of the PLO's renouncing the Palestinian<br />\nNational Covenant, which he said \"endorses national liberation struggle against<br />\nIsrael\" and denounces Israel suppression<br />\nof the uprisings as \"state terrorism.\"<br />\nSlonim said he was not precluding \"advances toward peace\" but warned that<br />\nIsrael should guard against the PLO's using \"war diplomacy by other means.'<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nLAST CHANCE<br />\n<br />\nGETIT<br />\nWHIE rrsHOT<br />\n<br />\nFor those of you who are .interested in<br />\napplying for the admissions representative positions available for the fall of<br />\n1989 in the Office of Admissions, you<br />\nmust apply immediately.

Mello<br />\nnamed two factors with which the<br />\nstate is concerned: the health of<br />\nthe mother and the life of the<br />\nbaby. Mello said state intervention should be based on the \"irrational basis test,\" following<br />\nalong the lines that \"when the<br />\ncourt finds a right that is fundamentally crucial to an individual, it can infringe upon that<br />\nright only if there is compelling<br />\ninterest.\"<br />\nAccording to present abortion<br />\nlaws, the state cannot prohibit<br />\nabortion in the first trimester of<br />\npregnancy. The decision to abort<br />\ncan be made by the woman, in<br />\nconsultation with a physician,<br />\nwithout state interference. In later<br />\nstages of pregnancy, states may<br />\nregulate abortions to protect the<br />\nlife of the mother.<br />\nIn the final stage, after the fetus<br />\nbecomes viable outside the<br />\nwomb, states may prohibit<br />\nabortions.<br />\nAfter Mello presented this information, she answered questions from the twenty students in<br />\nattendance.<br />\nOne student simply asked why<br />\n<br />\nthe abortion controversy is never<br />\nresolved. \"It's probably the<br />\nreligious reasons that get people<br />\nstirred up,\" Mello replied. \"If<br />\nyou really believe that killing an<br />\nunborn fetus is murder, then you<br />\ncan't relax. The issue won't die.\"<br />\nAnother student was concerned with the moral premise of<br />\nabortion and asked why Missouri<br />\nis not also considering the<br />\neconomic well-being of the<br />\nmother. Mello agreed that this<br />\nseeming lack of concern is an inconsistency in state policy that<br />\nhas no definite solution.<br />\nMello also discussed how safer<br />\nabortion techniques and improved<br />\npre-natal care might affect the<br />\ntrimester plan. Medical advances<br />\nshould make the trimester plan<br />\nmore acceptable to abortion foes,<br />\nshe contended. Mello called the<br />\ntrimester plan \"mathematically<br />\nconvenient\" and hoped that<br />\nSupreme Court Associate Justice<br />\nSandra Day O'Connor will<br />\nabolish it.<br />\nMello is apprehensive about the<br />\ndecision in the Missouri case<br />\nbecause of potential \"implications on the changing status of<br />\nwomen.\" She said the changing<br />\npersonnel of the Court presents a<br />\ndefinite possibility for an overruling of Roe.<br />\nChief Justice William Rehnquist and Associate Justice Antonin Scalia seem to advocate a<br />\nreturn of the power to regulate<br />\nabortions to the states. According<br />\nto Mello, \"they would recognize<br />\nthe right to privacy but still say<br />\nthat it does not encompass the<br />\nright to terminate pregnancy<br />\nbecause of state interests.<br />\n<br />\nCAMPUS CRIME<br />\n*Complainant reports that<br />\nsometime between February<br />\n25 at 7 p.m. and February 26<br />\nat 5 p.m., someone removed<br />\na pair of tennis shoes from his<br />\napartment in Wolman Hall.<br />\nNo one knows how entry was<br />\ngained.

I<br />\ndon't know if this year will be different.\"<br />\nIn the past, said Evans,<br />\nfreshman transfers tended to be<br />\nmore motivated by questions<br />\nabout the quality of life at<br />\nHopkins. Noting that students<br />\ntend to be on \"their best<br />\nbehavior\" when they speak to<br />\nher, Evans qualified her impressions by saying, \"I'm not sure<br />\n<br />\nthat if they [the students] come in<br />\nand give me reasons, that they are<br />\nthe same reasons [for wanting to<br />\ntransfer] they give their<br />\nroommates.<br />\n\"Another thing I hear are complaints against the competitiveness; they don't like how<br />\nthat striving for high performance<br />\ncan apparently make people<br />\nunpleasant,\" she continued.<br />\n\"But the kids who want to<br />\ntransfer are not the ones on<br />\nacademic probation.\"<br />\nFrom a 13.1 percent overall attrition rate for the Class of 1986,<br />\nthe rate fell to 12.7 percent and<br />\n9.5 percent for the Classes of<br />\n1987 and 1988, respectively.<br />\nBroadbent attributes this drop to<br />\na number of improvements in<br />\nundergraduate life at Hopkins,<br />\nparticularly those originating in<br />\nthe Office of Academic Advising.<br />\n\"I do know that Academic Advising has instituted a couple of<br />\nnew programs,\" she said. \"One<br />\nis an early warning program,<br />\nwhere they look at characteristics<br />\nof incoming freshmen and offer<br />\nthem tutoring services before they<br />\neven get here, to identify students<br />\nwho may be at risk.\u2014<br />\nNoting that housing larger<br />\nnumbers of incoming freshmen<br />\nhas necessitated placing freshmen<br />\nin University apartments rather<br />\nthan in dorms, Broadbent sug-<br />\n<br />\ngested that the additional contact<br />\nwith upperclassmen may have a<br />\nstabilizing effect upon freshmen,<br />\ndespite the social disadvantages<br />\nof not being in the dorms.<br />\nShe said, \"The Community<br />\nAssistant program may have also<br />\nhelped, although it is only a couple of years old.\"<br />\nWhile no one interviewed offered a direct correlation between<br />\nthe Five-Year Plan and the rising<br />\nnumber of freshmen trying to<br />\ntransfer, a senior faculty<br />\nmember, who declined to be<br />\nnamed, characterized the difby<br />\nencountered<br />\nficulties<br />\nundergraduates as problems that<br />\ntranscend housing and other<br />\namenity-related issues.<br />\nHe said, \"There are more people asking me for letters of<br />\nrecommendation than before,<br />\nalthough why, I don't know.\"<br />\nThe faculty member explained<br />\nthat the problems encountered by<br />\nArts and Sciences have their roots<br />\nin a twofold course pursued by<br />\nthe University, that of decentralization and expansion.<br />\nBecause of decentralization,<br />\nschools such as the G.W.C.<br />\nWhiting School of Engineering<br />\nwere given profitable divisions<br />\nsuch as the Evening School,<br />\nwhich had previously contributed<br />\nto a general Arts and Sciences<br />\nfund.<br />\n<br />\nBob Nelson<br />\n<br />\nSusan Broadbent,<br />\nassociate dean for institutional research and planning<br />\n\"We didn't used to have<br />\nSimultaneously, the Universiand<br />\ngraduate<br />\nty took on such financial liabilities separate<br />\nas the Peabody Conservatory and undergraduate courses; they were<br />\nexpanded into such projects as the all together,\" he said. \"You<br />\nNanjing Center.

Let us<br />\nnot allow this phenomenon to lead us to<br />\ndeclare this year's elections unimportant, however.

A real<br />\nStudent Union seems desirable<br />\nmore to provide a real social hub<br />\nfor upperclassmen than to serve<br />\nas the center for programming<br />\nand community events\u2014as it<br />\nmust be if the Good Adminstrators are to sell the idea of<br />\na<br />\nUnion<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\nBad<br />\nAdministrators.<br />\nThe irony is that there is an<br />\nideal hangout already on campus,<br />\na place replete with unique atmosphere, good food, beer, etc.,<br />\nbut it is being neglected by most<br />\nof the undergraduates, so much<br />\nso that its future is an open<br />\nquestion.<br />\nThe place is the Grad Club, a<br />\nspot which, it seems, should be<br />\na lot of things to a lot of people.<br />\nSituated in the basement of<br />\nMcCoy for the last 24 years, the<br />\nClub boomed for two decades until about six years ago, when<br />\nMaryland raised the drinking age<br />\nand the Club gained a reputation<br />\nas a place for graduate students.<br />\nThis reputation is no longer<br />\nparticularly valid; if anything, the<br />\ntide over the last year or so seems<br />\nto have turned over to the<br />\nundergraduates, but only on very<br />\nspecific nights, particularly on<br />\nThursdays' Funk Night and<br />\nFridays. For the earlier portion of<br />\nthe week, patronage at the Club<br />\nhas been poor to such an extent<br />\nthat they can no longer afford to<br />\nbe open Mondays.<br />\n<br />\nIn one sense, the early-week'<br />\nblues aren't all that surprising;<br />\nmost people are trying to get control over their classes after the<br />\nweekend, and this doesn't leave<br />\na lot of time to grab a beer or just<br />\nhang out.<br />\nYet any night of the week, PJ's<br />\nPub has a good crowd of people<br />\nwho come in for something to eat<br />\nafter the MSE closes down, and<br />\nso does the Snack Bar in AMR II.<br />\nThere is nothing wrong with<br />\neither of those places, but the<br />\nGrad Club is unique in that it is<br />\na genuinely home-grown product:<br />\nrun out of the SAC office and<br />\nmanaged by Hopkins students,<br />\nthe Club isn't part of Seiler's, nor<br />\nthe property of some local merchant. It truly belongs to the<br />\nstudents\u2014without them, it cannot<br />\nvery well survive.<br />\nThe food is as good and even<br />\ncheaper than what you find in the<br />\nSnack Bar, and includes things<br />\nlike gyros and pita pizza, which<br />\nyou won't find anywhere else in<br />\nCharles Village. And if you're<br />\nold enough, the beer is cheaper<br />\nthan you'll find anywhere around<br />\nhere, and includes everything<br />\nfrom Budweiser to Corona.<br />\nIf it sounds like I'm blowing<br />\nthe Grad Club's horn, it's<br />\nbecause I definitely am. When the<br />\nNews-Letter decided to stick its<br />\nnose into programming through<br />\nFunk Night, no place could have<br />\nbeen better suited to our needs<br />\nthan the Club, and it is difficult<br />\nto think of ways in which the<br />\nmanagement could have been<br />\nmore more helpful.

In<br />\nthe introduction entitled \"The<br />\nChallenge of Excellence\"<br />\nHopkins is described as a \"galaxy<br />\nwith two original stars, A&S and<br />\nMedicine.\" A galaxy, says my<br />\nDictionary of Cultural Literacy,<br />\nis \"a large, self-contained mass<br />\nof stars. A common form for<br />\ngalaxies is a bright center with<br />\nspiral arms radiating outward.\"<br />\nA star is \"an object in the sky that<br />\nsends out its own light. Each star<br />\nhas a definite lifetime, and dies<br />\nwhen it uses up its supply of fuel.<br />\nNew stars are being formed constantly.\"<br />\nThe Plan's space-age jargon<br />\nhence presupposes what most<br />\nprotesting students take for<br />\ngranted as well: a policy of<br />\ndecentralization and selfsufficiency of the divisions which<br />\nis grounded upon the ideology of<br />\nfree entrepreneurship and equal<br />\nopportunity. But do the Arts or<br />\neven the Sciences have an equal<br />\nchance at attracting funds and<br />\nproducing results with immediate<br />\ncash value\u2014compared to a<br />\nhospital or military research lab?<br />\nShould a university like Hopkins<br />\nreally be run as a profit-making<br />\nstore\u2014under the motto pecunia<br />\n<br />\nCampus Security appeared<br />\nnowhere in the article. Ms. Roth<br />\nwas invited to speak with major<br />\nLarkin, Chief of Security, but did<br />\nnot indicate that she did., one can<br />\nonly assume that she didn't.<br />\nFurther, the use of Ms.<br />\nMcCullough's quote, \"poorly,\"<br />\nis also in poor taste. By the nature<br />\nof an evacuation, there is no way<br />\nto execute one other than 'poorly.' One must go through the<br />\n<br />\nvos liberabit? In other words:<br />\nWill the history of the crisis<br />\nrepeat itself because this underlying structural problem has not<br />\nbeen addressed?<br />\n2) In many West German<br />\nuniversities, students(who do not<br />\neven pay tuition) have a quarter<br />\nof the votes in academic and administrative bodies. In a country<br />\nso proud of its democratic tradition, at a university so proud of<br />\nits foundation on the German<br />\nmodel, it should be possible to<br />\ngrant current students (graduate<br />\nand undergraduate from all divisions) a voice if not a vote in all<br />\ndecision-making bodies (including the Board of Trustees,<br />\nwhere the Young Trustees, who<br />\nare in fact young alumni, are supposed to represent the Homewood<br />\nundergraduates).<br />\n<br />\nwe aliPEA'SIAA/P 71/47- ONE NAINE<br />\nIIA/L-IkELV To SE fils-s-Ep evER 1.161/7zy<br />\nko/EN coA/simeiN6 ITEs-/PEA/TMazes<br />\nSUCCESSoR 15 p/Ar or feovor JO*<br />\n<br />\nSee LETTERS, 8<br />\ns000es povest- owe HAS<br />\nTAN,<br />\n-F<br />\n9C<br />\n-N RiAIWIN6 THU 's PAY-To-PAY Ar-<br />\n<br />\ntortIOARPT..-<br />\n<br />\nWHAT Po WANT lo AAkv<br />\nAl39UT 1-041114RD.1, Jr<br />\n601,<br />\n46 7gea415 77-/E<br />\n<br />\ncAlliffiv or MY DEBT-<br />\n<br />\nrAlg FoR Moro's: comEs Fkoti p/Aor<br />\n546k-G,ecutip<br />\nMiGor CALL 7NE<br />\nPA N fflin fr1154Lril, LcMiiing's FATNO\u2014<br />\nRMKElF A uNivek51-TY PREciPENr\u2014 MADE<br />\nSURE -THAT JoNN, Jr. TASTED csii-Y OF PIE<br />\ngESr\u201e.GeADE cQAoL AT -rAtiAregeo, Cum<br />\n1.AuD6 FROitl felificemtv, 11e/A10(5<br />\nfteEer<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\n0/441805....<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nRIDPEN INS77ru7laV<br />\nOF 1/61/ER lEARN/Nq<br />\nLE5LEY CYA#L?<br />\n<br />\nJan Linders<br />\nGRO Representative<br />\nThe writer is a member of The<br />\nDepartment of German.<br />\n'Arr TYE OUESTioAl FOR /*VW /r0P1.4:<br />\nw, js 77/15,Or 044r USE W Av./80'1'1'5 BA CeGeOUND <56 To Tollivs-<br />\n<br />\nSecurity distress<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n<br />\ngopovs uNikeEnr-Y<br />\n<br />\nCIP (40P<br />\nL<br />\n(<br />\n<br />\nPO/Air OUT 7I-14r Jr WeED Fol?<br />\nVIE PRESIDENCY 1,9,445A1721\" cow gE<br />\nCOWTEP ON r9 AZ\"Pt ii;v6HTsaPs FrviVE<br />\nHoek-Ws AN/WALLY,BY (.1.57N6 71/6 SAME<br />\nmc-105 HES USED TH,fou&HOW-Acmosr<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nNi(t ht<br />\n(140<br />\n<br />\n8 1041MINNINUMMIIIMNIMIW<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nin.<br />\n<br />\nPoN'eleo LJE Ale;<br />\nAWN- APP.1!<br />\ntvoiep<br />\n<br />\nyou 6or Mat ruificit/<br />\n110<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n;4-ryy<br />\n<br />\nPPM-ME-YEAR WEER AT<br />\n<br />\n44,,V<br />\n<br />\nThursday after<br />\nSpring Break!<br />\n1M<br />\n<br />\nHE ProiliSrS'91.11\"-<br />\n<br />\nR0er<br />\n<br />\nI would like to take this opportunity to express my distress<br />\nabout the article, Bomb threat<br />\nforces evacuation (News-Letter,<br />\n24 February 1989). This article<br />\nwas done, in my opinion, in very<br />\npoor taste, and seemed almost<br />\ndesigned to once again criticize<br />\nCampus Security.<br />\nFirst of all, the viewpoint of<br />\n<br />\ne(e) (I) ae<br />\n<br />\nM<br />\n<br />\nty only dispatches an ambulance<br />\nand a fire truck. The police are<br />\nnot called until it is determined<br />\nthat they are needed on the scene.<br />\nSecond, there were several bomb<br />\nthreats around Baltimore City<br />\nduring that time. Whether the City handled them on a \"first-come,<br />\n<br />\nLESLEY<br />\n<br />\nFunk Night is<br />\n<br />\n4141.1M<br />\n<br />\nbuilding and get everyone out as<br />\nquickly as possible. There is an<br />\nadded hindrance that neither the<br />\nwalkie-talkies or the fire alarms<br />\ncan be used during a bomb scare,<br />\nsince each has the potential to<br />\ndetonate an explosive. (The first<br />\nprecaution was abandoned).<br />\nFinally, there are two basic<br />\nreasons why the City Police took<br />\nso long to respond. One is that<br />\nwhen someone calls 911, the Ci-<br />\n<br />\nGrad Club, 10 to 2<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION<br />\nCLUBS<br />\nAND<br />\nORGANIZATIONS<br />\nWe need your<br />\nparticipation in Open<br />\nHouse Day programs<br />\nFriday, April 21<br />\n<br />\n0.11.10.1<br />\n<br />\nMonday, A\u2022rii 24<br />\nafternoons in Glass<br />\nPavilion<br />\n<br />\nThere is a reason<br />\nto come back<br />\nfrom Spring Break!<br />\n<br />\nCONTACT: Sonia Bell<br />\nExt. 8171<br />\n<br />\nOFFICE OF ADMISSIONS<br />\n<br />\nDrinks with 2 ID<br />\nCover:. $1 .<br />\nar-7,sarc.c1<br />\n<br />\nby<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\n1\\/VV.S-1___G'tte<br />\n<br />\n\fLetters<br />\nLETTERS, from 7<br />\nfirst-serve- basis, or by priority,<br />\nor a combination, the Police dogs<br />\nwere detained in other threats.<br />\nIn light of the several recent<br />\ncriticisms of Campus Security, a<br />\nreporter such as Ms. Roth should<br />\ndo a more in-depth investigation<br />\nbefore printing an article such as<br />\nthis.<br />\nEric Hymowitz<br />\nEds. note: We regret the<br />\nwriter's dissatisfaction with the<br />\narticle, but fully support our<br />\nreporter's investigation of the<br />\nbomb threat. The article she<br />\nwrote was factual and free of<br />\nbias. Her reporting was entirely<br />\nsatisfactory, particularly in light<br />\nof the severe time restraints our<br />\nproduction schedule imposed on<br />\nher.<br />\n<br />\nDebate continues...<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nSome of you may have noticed<br />\nthe latest gimmick from CR Greg<br />\nFrancis: a petition requesting that<br />\nthe Chaplain and her employees<br />\n\"limit their activities to the realm<br />\nof the religious; that is, to those<br />\nareas that have direct bearing on<br />\nthe spiritual welfare and the<br />\nreligious faith of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.- Although I strongly<br />\noppose the CR's tactics on the<br />\nChaplain, I nevertheless urge all<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins corn-<br />\n<br />\nmunity to sign this petition. Now<br />\nyou may be asking, well, Mr.<br />\nJohnston, what gives? Simple: the<br />\nCR's continue to misunderstand<br />\nthe nature of the issue. This,<br />\ndespite the fact that they are the<br />\nones who made it an issue in the<br />\nfirst place.<br />\nAs I pointed out in my letter of<br />\nFebruary 10th, everybody agrees<br />\nthat the Chaplain should limit her<br />\nactivities to the realm of the<br />\nreligious. That is no issue at all.<br />\nThus, since the CR's have called<br />\nfor no more than what we have<br />\nalready agreed upon, how can we<br />\ndo anything but affirm our agreement'? In fact, I find it a little difficult to see how anyone could<br />\nrefuse to sign this petition.<br />\nDoes this mean that the CR's<br />\nand I are now in total agreement<br />\non the issue of the Chaplain? Far<br />\nfrom it. The real issue is not<br />\nshould the Chaplain limit herself<br />\nto religious activities. Rather, the<br />\nreal issue is, who decides what<br />\nactivities do and don't count as<br />\nreligious? Should this issue be<br />\ndecided by a political group\u2014the<br />\nRepublicans\u2014dictating what<br />\ncounts as religon? (Hello Russia?)<br />\nOr should we follow the Founding Fathers and leave it up to a<br />\nreligious figure\u2014the Chaplain\u2014<br />\nto determine what counts as a<br />\nreligious activity? Somehow this<br />\nissue is never addressed by the<br />\npetition (in fact, the CR's have<br />\nyet to address this issue). So sign<br />\nthe petition and oppose the CR's<br />\nattempt to dictate religion.<br />\n<br />\npseudo: of having what you ask for<br />\nPSEUDO, from 6<br />\n<br />\nthey will not renovate and move<br />\nthe Grad Club if it is not viable<br />\nbeforehand.<br />\nThe booming success of Thursday and Friday nights shows that<br />\nthe Grad Club can be made to<br />\nwork if only students are interested, and it may be that there<br />\nhas just been a poor understanding of the nature of the Club<br />\namong undergraduates lately.<br />\nIf you have ideas about what<br />\ncould be done to increase interest<br />\nin the Grad Club earlier in the<br />\nweek<br />\n(Tuesdays<br />\nand<br />\nWednesdays, which are crucial<br />\ndays financially), talk to Shelley<br />\nAlbrecht in the Student Activities<br />\nOffice. The News-Letter's Funk<br />\nNight experience suggests that<br />\nshe is flexible and interested, but<br />\nthe low level of student feedback<br />\nhas made it difficult to decide<br />\nwhat people are really interested<br />\nin.<br />\nMost importantly, we should<br />\nstart to look at the Grad Club for<br />\nwhat it is: at least the equal\u2014and<br />\nprobably the better\u2014of the AMR<br />\nSnack Bar, Pis, or CVP as a<br />\n\u2022 place to wind down from the<br />\nlibrary late at night, or to grab<br />\nsome food in between reserve<br />\nreadings.<br />\nBut the most important thing<br />\nabout the success of the Grad<br />\nClub is that it really is one of the<br />\nSteve Johnson few<br />\ntraditions,<br />\nHopkins<br />\n<br />\nacademics aside, that we can all<br />\nenjoy. Hopkins has too few things<br />\nthat have lasted so long that an<br />\nalum could identify with an<br />\nundergrad today. It would be a<br />\nshame if we couldn't make this<br />\none work out in the long run.<br />\nAs the undergraduate population at Hopkins continues to expand, the need for places like the<br />\nGrad Club will increase proportionately. But as anyone who has<br />\nfought for anything expensive and<br />\nnew here can attest, restarting<br />\nsomething like the Grad Club<br />\nstarted again after it has been<br />\nclosed would be much easier said<br />\nthan done. Not to mention that the<br />\nClub has a unique personality to<br />\nit, something which takes time to<br />\nachieve\u2014a psychedelic paint job<br />\nand wainscotting is not what the<br />\never-generous Young Alumni<br />\nwould probably have in mind in<br />\ntheir decorating plans.<br />\nSo go to the Grad Club, open<br />\nTuesday through Friday. If more<br />\npeople go to things like Tuesday's<br />\nMovie Night, the number of open<br />\nnights will increase, and the<br />\nClub's future will be more<br />\nsecure. It's our ball, Hopkins,<br />\nand the Grad Club is for you. Go.<br />\nfloor is just the right size for the<br />\nnumber of people we usually<br />\ndraw, and there are pinball games<br />\nand tables in the back for people<br />\nwho need a break from getting<br />\ndown.<br />\nThis is why it's hard to unders-<br />\n<br />\n\u2022:\u2022\u2022:\u2022 \u2022:\u2022\u2022:. \u2022:- \u2022:\u2022\u2022:\u2022<br />\n<br />\nAttention Seniors &<br />\nGraduate Students:<br />\nIf you are completing your degree this year and<br />\nhave not registered with the Office of Career<br />\nCounseling and Placement, please stop by 224A<br />\nMergenthaler Hall as soon as possible.

On the<br />\none hand, the University is going<br />\nthrough the financial straights we<br />\nhave all been having rammed<br />\ndown our throats lately, and the<br />\nchances of their continuing to<br />\nfund a money-losing proposition<br />\nfor long are slim.

This Waverly food vendor is Baltimore's only<br />\nnatural food storefront co-op, and its members are seriously committed to providing good food to the local<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe Belly is not run for profit; if it did turn a profit,<br />\nthe proceeds, as member Mark Snesil noted, \"would have<br />\nto be given away.\" Food bought on sale is sold on sale,<br />\nand prices may not rise until weeks after inflation has hit.<br />\nGussie Tweedy, a four-year member of The Belly, recalled selling bagels for six weeks below cost.<br />\nAll the food at The Belly is vegetarian, although<br />\nTweedy admitted to sometimes sneaking in salmon or<br />\ntuna. The selection filled food and flours is extensive,<br />\nranging from pe,arleu parley, kasha and organic buckwheat<br />\nflour to organic black turtle beans and lentils. Organic,<br />\nexplained Tweedy, actually does mean more than high<br />\nprices: certified organic food must be grown in soil not<br />\n<br />\nfertilized by chemicals in two years. Distributors\u2022are<br />\nresponding to the increased demand for chemical-free<br />\nfood; as their organic stock increases, prices may drop<br />\naccordingly.<br />\nFruits and vegetables at The Belly are more mundane:<br />\napples, onions, and potatoes are standard stock. Canned<br />\nand jarred foods are sparse and highly-priced: a 25 oz.<br />\njar of sugar-free applesauce cost $1.72, in comparison<br />\nwith $.89 at Eddie's. The breads, some with flavorings as<br />\nexotic as cheddar cheese or peach, are delivered fresh<br />\n<br />\nEly Brown<br />\n<br />\nEly Brown<br />\n<br />\nTuesdays and Fridays.

Individuals can become<br />\nmembers by paying $15 and, if they choose, by working<br />\na minimum of three hours per month at the store.<br />\nMembers can also work at The Belly without paying a<br />\nfee. The Belly currently claims approximately one hundred members; approximately twenty members are<br />\nHopkins students. New members, said Snesil, are<br />\n<br />\nwelcome, \"not just from the consumer end but as an active voice as to what the store can be for everyone. We<br />\nhave lots of room to grow.\" New members join the coop by attending one of Snesil's biweekly orientation<br />\nmeetings; signup sheets are posted in the store.<br />\nThe Belly was founded in 1975 by students as a means<br />\nto provide cheaper food, without the cost of paid labor.<br />\nLack of storage space prevents the co-op from buying food<br />\nat bulk rates, but food is always sold at the lowest possible prices. Members work when they want to; consequently, the atmosphere is caring and relaxed. As Tweedy<br />\nnoted, \"We provide an essential service. . .everybody<br />\nneeds food.\"<br />\nFor variety and freshness in dried foods, flours, and<br />\nspices, The Belly can't be beat, although I would recommend shopping elsewhere for canned goods and produce.<br />\nYou can find The Belly at 427 East 31st Street.

Perhaps some of you have begun to wonder why<br />\nin the world you are still here, or even why you came<br />\nin the first place. Isn't there some less painful way, you<br />\nwonder, for a student to acquire useful information on<br />\nhis or her way to becoming a contributing member of<br />\nsociety? Unfortunately, the simple, distressing fact is that<br />\nmost classes here at Hopkins are designed to force the<br />\nrequired material into the heads of us unwilling victims<br />\nwith the maximum amount of pain possible.<br />\nFortunately, there do exist alternative methods of learning, methods that don't necessarily require that one submit to the rigors of the classroom. I have recently become<br />\nacquainted with one such alternative. It is the<br />\nUndergraduate Reading, sponsored by the Writing<br />\nSeminars Department.<br />\nEvery Monday night at about six or seven-thirty, a<br />\ngroup of people meet in the Little Theatre in Levering<br />\nHall to listen to various students read their prose and<br />\npoetry aloud. The program is co-chaired by two<br />\nundergraduates, Jenny Levy and Louise Redd, both<br />\nWriting Seminars majors. I had the opportunity to talk<br />\nto both of them and to attend the two most recent programs of the series.<br />\nThe programs were started about ten years ago by the<br />\nlate Dr. Robert Arellano, who was concerned about providing an opportunity for students to receive criticism on<br />\ntheir writing from peers outside of the classroom environment. Since then it has been sponsored by various pro-<br />\n<br />\nfessors in the Writing Seminars department up until the<br />\ncurrent sponsor, Jean McGarry, who was previously a<br />\ngraduate student in the department. Both Redd and Levy<br />\ncommented that the interest that McGarry has shown has<br />\nbeen very encouraging.<br />\nRedd stressed that any undergraduate who felt the desire<br />\nto read was welcome to do so, and also expressed the<br />\ndesire that the attendance to the programs was larger and<br />\nmore consistent. Anyone who wants to read can contact<br />\none of the co-chairs as little as a week in advance of the<br />\ndesired reading date and still be assured of consideration.<br />\nAt both programs I attended, I was particularly struck<br />\nby the relaxed atmosphere. Nobody seemed conscious of<br />\nthe passage of time, and a few minutes stretched easily<br />\nand unnoticeably into five or ten. During the break, people wandered into little groups talking and laughing, or<br />\njust lounged on the chairs, smoking cigarettes. Over in<br />\none corner, a girl started to bang on the piano, while in<br />\nanother, two guys discussed going out for a drink<br />\nafterwards.<br />\nThe stories and poems were interesting and absorbing,<br />\ndealing with subjects as varied as the people who read<br />\nthem were different. A junior philosophy major read a<br />\nnumber of her poems on African and Asian love themes,<br />\nwhile a senior football player read a story about a downon-his-luck private eye. Another senior, like the football<br />\nplayer in the writing seminars department, read some witty letters written to him by a friend, as well as an excellent<br />\nstory about a journalist going through significant changes<br />\nin his life. There was a story about the sweetness of<br />\nrevenge, and a particularly humorous one concerning an<br />\nanalysis of the various methods of vomiting.<br />\nBut back to the central problem: the ability of a stu-<br />\n<br />\nMike Blumhardt<br />\n<br />\nJonathan Abrahams presents his work at a reading held<br />\ntwo<br />\nweeks ago.<br />\n<br />\ndent to learn without effort. How does the program help<br />\naccomplish this? For one thing, it provides an opportunity for a student in some of the more time-consuming majors to become acquainted with an outlook on life that is<br />\nperhaps entirely different from what he or she is accustomed to. This can be a valuable learning experience for<br />\nanyone. It gives a student a chance to make new friends<br />\nwho can be very different from those he or she is used to.<br />\nOf course, it also gives the students a chance to become<br />\nacquainted with the ways different people express<br />\nthemselves, and thereby, to become somewhat acquainted<br />\nwith the writers themselves. Most importantly, any learning that takes place there occurs practically effortlessly, and only requires that one be reasonably observant.<br />\nRemember, the cold, hard fact is that we are here at<br />\ncollege to learn. The good news is that there are easy ways<br />\nto do it. This is one of the ways that is easy and enjoyable<br />\nat the same time.

At almost<br />\nall large universities, only<br />\ngraduate students have the chance<br />\nto do research. At Hopkins, many<br />\nundergraduates can be found in<br />\nthe labs at both Homewood Campus and at the Medical School.<br />\nSo. how do you find a research<br />\njob?<br />\nFirst of all, you must decide in<br />\nwhat areas you would like to<br />\nwork. Research can get awfully<br />\nboring if you're in an area that<br />\ndoes not interest you. Says one<br />\nundergraduate biology researcher, \"[Research] is doubleedged because you can really get<br />\ninto it and more interested in the<br />\nfield, or you can get bored out of<br />\nyour mind.\" The area you choose<br />\nis also important because the way<br />\nto approach applying for a job<br />\ndiffers from departement to<br />\ndepartment. For example,<br />\nstudents interested in psychology<br />\nresearch are advised to see the<br />\nlistings on the bulletin board<br />\nAmes Hall. In the Biomedica)<br />\nEngineering department, an<br />\naspiring student researcher should<br />\ngo from lab to lab and ask. Professors recommend that you have<br />\na resume available so that they<br />\ncan remember you. A student<br />\nworking in the Oncology department at the Medical School says<br />\nthat he just gave his resume to the<br />\n<br />\ndepartment secretary and she then primarily consisted of menial credit, the credit can apply<br />\ncirculated it within the depart- tasks like making solutions, towards your major or perhaps as<br />\nment.

Were it not<br />\nfor the multimillion dollar<br />\npricetag slapped on his head by<br />\nIslamic crazies, his message in<br />\nthe address would undoubtedly<br />\necho statements from his latest<br />\nbook, The Satanic Verses:<br />\n\"Language is courage: the ability to conceive a thought, to speak<br />\nit, and by doing so make it true.\"<br />\nIndeed, Rushdie's sudden prominence in the international<br />\nmedia has turned him into nothing<br />\nless than a cause, a rallying point<br />\nfor American writers on behalf of<br />\nliterary and religious freedoms.<br />\nNever before has a writer had to<br />\ncontend with the notoriety accompanying an international smear<br />\ncampaign and face the prospect of<br />\nliterary martyrdom.<br />\nThe politics surrounding<br />\nSatanic Verses have tended to<br />\novershadow any serious attempt<br />\nto discuss the book as literature.<br />\nWhen the second printing makes<br />\nthe book widely available once<br />\nagain [Ed. note: the Barnes and<br />\nNoble outlet on campus now has<br />\ncopies of the novel in stock], people will purchase (and perhaps<br />\neven read) this long, dense book<br />\nfor the wrong reasons: namely, to<br />\nassert one's individual literary<br />\nfreedom (a reason as suspect as<br />\nLarry Flynt's battle cry, in the<br />\nwake of the Meese Commission<br />\nReport, for people to purchase<br />\nPlayboy and other skin mags to<br />\nexpress belief in freedom of<br />\nliterary expression); or to read it<br />\nonly for the blaspheming parts, to<br />\nsee \"if it's as bad as they say it<br />\nis.\" It is the unfortunate fate of<br />\nSatanic Verses to be remembered<br />\nfor the political furor it inspired<br />\nrather than the literary merits it<br />\nmay or may not have.<br />\nThe novel displays many of the<br />\nRushdie traits typical of books<br />\nlike Shame (1983). Lots of<br />\ndreams, lots of hyperbolic<br />\nviolence and scatology, lots of<br />\nconfrontation between Eastern<br />\nand Western culture (which is<br />\nhardly surprising, given that<br />\nRushdie was born in India,<br />\neducated in Britain, and has a<br />\nfamily living in Pakistan), lots of<br />\n<br />\nvulgarity (which really stands<br />\nagainst the elegant, ornate prose<br />\nstyle) and lots of characters (my<br />\nlist filled five pages). The book<br />\nhas an epic quality to it; it is loaded with stories-within-stories that<br />\nare loosely connected to each<br />\nother at best, and it contains its<br />\nfair share of authorial asides.<br />\nPerhaps the most jarring thing<br />\nabout the book is how it alternates<br />\nfrom a fairy-tale mode full of talk<br />\nabout the Flintstones, the Rolling<br />\nStones, and Tinkerbell, not to<br />\nmention the Bhopal disaster,<br />\nMaggie Thatcher, and idioms like<br />\n\"That's the ticket\" and \"F---ing<br />\n<br />\n\"It is the unfortunate<br />\nfate of Satanic Verses<br />\nto be remembered for<br />\nthe political furor it inspired rather than for<br />\nthe literary merits it<br />\nmay or may not have.\"<br />\nA.\"<br />\nThe novel starts off with a<br />\nmarvelous premise: two people<br />\nfalling in midair from a plane<br />\n29,002 feet up. The rest of the<br />\nnovel recounts their fallout with<br />\neach other after both of them<br />\nmiraculously survive the fall<br />\n(\"Let's face it,\" says the narrator; \"it was impossible...how,<br />\ncould they? But let's face this,<br />\ntoo, they did.\"). The first is<br />\nGibreel Farishta, a widely acclaimed actor in \"theologicals,\"<br />\nmovies depicting the lives of prophets and holy men. He is a<br />\nwomanizer and rather taken with<br />\nhimself; he has the propensity for<br />\nhaving strange religious dreams<br />\nas well as chronic halitosis. The<br />\n!other guy is Saladin Chamcha, an<br />\nactor in demand by radio and TV<br />\nfor his ability to imitate voices,<br />\nto know how a ketchup bottle<br />\nshould talk and what it would<br />\nwant to say. He also is a curmudgeon, dissatisfied with the<br />\n'coarseness of his mother country,<br />\nIndia, and his curmudgeon father,<br />\nwho treats him like a child<br />\nwithout toilet training. After the<br />\nfall, as luck will have it, Gibreel<br />\nenjoys the appearance of a golden<br />\nhalo over his head as well as great<br />\nsex from a mountain climber<br />\nnamed Alleluia Cone and a boost<br />\nin his acting career, stemming<br />\nfrorn his role in \"Friend!\" an<br />\nadaptation of Dickens's Our<br />\nMutual Friend.<br />\nChamcha, on the other hand, is<br />\nnot so lucky.

After<br />\nfalling from the sky, he is arrested, treated degradingly by the<br />\nBritish police (a statement by<br />\nRushdie on the racial relations in<br />\nBritain) and put into a hospital<br />\nfull of other dehumanized animals<br />\n(\"They [the British police] have<br />\nthe power of description, and we<br />\nsuccumb to the pictures they construct.\") His girlfriend, thinking<br />\nhim dead, starts sleeping with his<br />\nbest friend, leaving him no choice<br />\nbut to hide away in a desolate attic of a motel/cafe watching TV.<br />\nThis only skims the surface of<br />\nthe overly convoluted plot. And<br />\nit neglects to make mention of the<br />\ncountless number of dreams and<br />\nset pieces. Some of these episodes<br />\nare fascinating, but most of them<br />\nare quite dull. The main conflict<br />\nof the story, once you take away<br />\nall the chatter about London (called \"Ellowen Deeowen\"<br />\nthroughout the book) and the<br />\nreligious dreaming of Gibreel, is<br />\nChamcha's seething jealosy of<br />\nGibreel's good fortune after the<br />\nairplane fall. But wait, let's be<br />\nfair. The novel also tries to deal<br />\nwith many other conflicts, Most<br />\nnotably the one about Gibreel's<br />\nattempt to deal with his chronic<br />\ndreaming.<br />\nIn a crucial passage right after<br />\nthe allegedly blasphemous<br />\nMahound scene, Gibreel (who is<br />\nimagining the scene), finds he<br />\ncannot continue with this dream<br />\nwithout involving himself too<br />\ndeeply:<br />\n\"Gibreel: the dreamer, whose<br />\npoint of view is sometimes that of<br />\nthe camera and at other moments,<br />\nspectator. When he's a camera<br />\nthe pee oh vee is always on the<br />\nmove, he hates static shots, so<br />\nhe's floating up on a high crane<br />\nlooking down at the foreshortened figures of the actors, or he's<br />\nswooping down to stand invisibly<br />\nbetween them, turning slowly on<br />\nhis heel to achieve a three<br />\nhundred-and sixty degree<br />\npan. . . And then, without warning, Hazma says to Mahound:<br />\n\"Go ask Gibreel,\" and he, the<br />\ndreamer, feels his heart leaping<br />\nin alarm, who me? I'm supposed<br />\nto know the answers here? I'm<br />\nsitting here watching this picture<br />\nand now this actor points his<br />\nfingers out at me, who ever heard<br />\nthe like, who asks the bloody audience of a 'theological' to solve<br />\na bloody plot?\"<br />\nThe dreamer can assume one of<br />\n<br />\ntwo roles in his dreaming: that of<br />\npassive spectator, or that of active participant-creator. The<br />\nspectator-dreamer watches his<br />\ndreams without attempting to<br />\ncontrol them, and in doing so,<br />\nevades responsibility for the<br />\ndream's outcome; how can a<br />\nmoviegoer change what appears<br />\non the movie screen? The dream<br />\nprogresses naturally and is<br />\nautonomous of the viewer's attempt to direct it. But when the<br />\nc.,eam runs out of its own accord,<br />\nwhat can the dreamer do? He can<br />\ninsert his personal feelings into<br />\nthe dream to get it started once<br />\nagain while running the risk of<br />\nhaving it seem contrived. That is<br />\nwhat the historical fact of<br />\n\"satanic verses\" is all about.<br />\nMuhammad (\"Mahound- in the<br />\nbook), in a moment where he appears to exchange religious commitment for political expedience,<br />\naccepts the existence of three<br />\npagan goddesses in order to further his own religion. This<br />\nblatently contradicts the primary<br />\nmessage of the religion\u2014that there<br />\nis only one God, Allah\u2014and his<br />\n<br />\n\"Why would the<br />\nMuslim communities of<br />\nthe world find<br />\nRushdie's depictions of<br />\nMuhammad so<br />\noffensive?\"<br />\nfollowers are shocked. So he<br />\ncomes back, says that Gabriel<br />\n(Gibreel in the book) has come to<br />\nhim once again in a dream, and<br />\ntold Muhammad to retract those<br />\nverses in which he accepts the<br />\nthree goddesses, that these verses<br />\ncame from Satan.<br />\nEven after this retraction, there<br />\nis the lingering suspicion in the<br />\nminds of the followers that the<br />\nsatanic verses were not inspired<br />\nat all by the devil, but were actually Muhammad's own words,<br />\nto which he ascribes first to<br />\nGabriel; and later, when his<br />\nfollowers start questioning him,<br />\nto the devil. In this instance,<br />\nMuhammad/Mahound fabricates<br />\nanother dream to hide his first<br />\nmistake.<br />\nWhy would the Muslim communities of the world find<br />\nRushdie's depictions of Muhammad so offensive?

Without a<br />\ndoubt. It is not just the subject<br />\nmatter that is blasphemous; it is<br />\nthe fact that most of the condemnatory speeches come from<br />\nSalman's own lips and that these<br />\nscenes are told in a livid present<br />\ntense using contemporary idioms<br />\nand slang words. Rushdie can<br />\nclaim that he did not mean for the<br />\nwork to offend anybody, and that<br />\nall of the Mahound sequences<br />\nwere framed in dreams, thus<br />\nrendering them harmless. But<br />\nMuslims can perceive a malicious<br />\nintention in this novel; just as<br />\nMahound tries to forswear the<br />\nSatanic Verses by arguing that his<br />\npersonal self had no part of their<br />\ncreation.

More importantly, the<br />\nJays held Syracuse scoreless for<br />\n18:08 at the start of the second<br />\nhalf with a ball control offense.<br />\nThe key to that offense was senior<br />\ncaptain Brendan Kelly.<br />\nThose people who came to the<br />\ngame touting Gary Gait as the nation's top midfielder left talking<br />\nabout Kelly. He quarterbacked<br />\nthe Hopkins attack to perfection,<br />\n\u2022 scoring two goals and setting up<br />\nmany others with some dazzling<br />\nstick handling. Indeed, the senior<br />\nfrom Towson earned his right to<br />\nbe mentioned as one of the nation's top players.<br />\n\"Brendan played the best game<br />\nof his career,\" commented<br />\nHopkins Coach Don Zimmerman. He took complete charge<br />\nof the game.\"<br />\nBut early in the game, it was<br />\nthe Orangemen who took control<br />\nof the game with their fast-break<br />\noffense. Syracuse jumped out to<br />\na 3-1 lead, paced by a goal and<br />\ntwo assists from All-American<br />\nJohn Zulberti. Matt Panetta, a<br />\nsophomore from Elmont, NY,<br />\ntied the game with two<br />\nunanswered goals midway<br />\nthrough the first quarter. For the<br />\nrest of the first half, the two teams<br />\n<br />\ntraded goals in an explosive, seesaw battle.<br />\nThough the Jays trailed only<br />\n9-8 at the half, they had let the<br />\nOrangemen control the pace of<br />\nthe game. Realizing that they<br />\ncould not run with Syracuse for<br />\nsixty minutes, Hopkins began to<br />\nexecute their ball-control offense<br />\nin the second half. With the pace<br />\nof the game slowed down, Quint<br />\nKessenich and the rest of the<br />\ndefense were able to take control,<br />\nas they blanked the \"unstoppable\" Orangemen for the entire<br />\nthird quarter. Before Syracuse<br />\nwas finally able to get back on the<br />\nscoreboard three minutes into the<br />\nfourth quarter, Hopkins had<br />\nscored four unanswered goals to<br />\ntake a 12-9 lead.<br />\nThe Orangemen came back<br />\nearly in the fourth quarter on<br />\ngoals by Phil Schulter and AllAmerican Gren Burns to again<br />\nmake it a one goal game. Adam<br />\nWright, however, quickly put the<br />\nJays back in control, as he netted<br />\nhis third goal of the game with<br />\njust over seven minutes remaining. Three minutes later, Matt<br />\nPanetta left Syracuse goalie Matt<br />\nPalumb on the ground at the endline and put his fourth goal of the<br />\ngame into an empty net to give<br />\nHopkins a 14-11 lead.<br />\nBut the Gait brothers refused to<br />\ngo down without a struggle. Just<br />\nthirty-seven seconds after Panet-<br />\n<br />\nta had given the Jays a commanding three goal lead, Gary took<br />\na pass from his brother Paul and<br />\nbeat Kessenich with a beautiful<br />\nmove in traffic. Twenty-one<br />\nseconds later, it was again a one<br />\ngoal game, as Greg Burns scored<br />\noff Zulberti's fourth assist of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nHopkins went back to ball control in an attempt to kill the clock,<br />\nbut Syracuse put constant<br />\npressure on the ball. The Blue<br />\nJays didn't secure the game until<br />\nJohn Dressel picked up a key<br />\nground ball with just over a<br />\nminute remaining. From then on,<br />\nHopkins gave the ball to Matt<br />\nPanetta and dared the Orangemen<br />\nto take it away from him.<br />\nNeedless to say, they couldn't,<br />\nand the Blue Jays defeated<br />\nSyracuse for the first time in four<br />\nyears.<br />\nHopkins now enters a fairly<br />\neasy part of their schedule, as<br />\nthey face Washington College,<br />\nRutgers, and Princeton on consecutive Saturdays. Washington<br />\ngave the Jays all they could handle last year in Chestertown<br />\nbefore falling 12-8. They are led<br />\non offense by Tim Hormes, a<br />\nDivision III All-American who<br />\nhad 49 goals and 20 ssists last<br />\nyear, and on defense by Matt<br />\nWilson, who was the Division III<br />\nDefenseman of the Year last<br />\nseason.

For the<br />\nmen, it was a tie for the most wins<br />\nin Hopkins history (17), the MAC<br />\nSoutheastern Division Championship, and a fifth place ranking in<br />\nthe Middle Athletic region (one<br />\nspot shy of being invited to the<br />\nnational tournament). However,<br />\nit has not always been this way.<br />\nThree years ago, when coaches<br />\nBill Nelson and Nancy Blank arrived at Hopkins, the basketball<br />\nprograms were looking for focus<br />\nand direction. There was virtually no effort made to recruit and<br />\nbring in substantial scholar<br />\nathletes and create a winning atmosphere at Hopkins. Nelson and<br />\nBlank were hired in June of 1986<br />\nto do just that.<br />\nRobert Scott, Director of<br />\nAthletics at Hopkins, described<br />\ncoaches Nelson and Blank as<br />\n\"proven coaches with proven<br />\nrecords.\" That they certainly are.<br />\nIn 1986, Nelson came to Hopkins<br />\nhaving spent three years at<br />\nNazareth College in Rochester<br />\nand three years at Rochester Institute of Technology. He has<br />\nbeen honored as Coach of the<br />\nYear by the Independent Collegiate Athletic Conference and<br />\nthe New York State Basketball<br />\nCoaches Association, and has<br />\nreached the NCAA Division III<br />\nTournament twice. At R.I.T., he<br />\ntransformed a very lackluster<br />\n<br />\nprogram into a conference champion in three years. Sound<br />\nfamiliar? His final year at<br />\nNazareth, he finished second in<br />\nthe New York State Coaches Poll<br />\nand seventh in the Final NCAA<br />\nDivision III poll.<br />\nBlank also came to Hopkins<br />\nafter guiding Messiah College to<br />\nthe W.C.I.A. Championship in<br />\n1978 and 1980 and the NCAA<br />\nDistrict II Championship in 1982<br />\nand 1983.<br />\nThe main reason, however,<br />\nthat Nelson and Blank have been<br />\nable to achieve such tremendous<br />\nsuccess, besides their ability to<br />\ncoach the sport well, is their ability to recruit excellent scholarathletes. According to Jerome<br />\nSchnydman, Director of<br />\nUndergraduate Admissions,<br />\n\"There are two reasons why<br />\ncoaches are successful. One,<br />\nbecause they can coach the sport.<br />\nThe second is because they are<br />\ngood recruiters, which is one of<br />\nthe reasons why they have had the<br />\nability to be good coaches. From<br />\nthe start, they have been successful in identifying studentathletes who might be interested<br />\nin Hopkins. When I ask them<br />\nabout the people they recruit,<br />\n...they know all about them,<br />\nacademically and athletically. . .The proof is in the pudding,<br />\nthey are doing well in school and<br />\non the court. What they have said<br />\nhas proven true, they have done<br />\nthe job recruiting good students<br />\nwho are good athletes.\"<br />\nEven though Hopkins has committed itself to improving its<br />\n<br />\nbasketball programs, it has not<br />\nbeen forced to compromise admissions standards to do so. In<br />\nfact, the story is quite the opposite. According to Nelson, his<br />\nbasketball team is a composite of<br />\nnot only both social and physical<br />\nscience majors, but claims a<br />\nformer high school valedictorian<br />\nand a Beneficial Hodson Scholar.<br />\nAccording to Blank, recruiting<br />\nhas been extremely instrumental<br />\nto her teams success. In her attempts to recruit a freshman<br />\nclass, she, like Nelson, visits<br />\nplayers throughout the year, visits<br />\nbasketball camps during the summer, and uses a recruiting<br />\nstatistical service (called Metro<br />\nIndex) to sort through the endless<br />\nlist of potential prospects. Also<br />\nthrough her network of contacts,<br />\nshe will try to get a feel for those<br />\nscholar-athletes who might be interested in playing Division III<br />\nbasketball at a school like<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe first step for Blank is to go<br />\nthrough her list of potential prospects and sort out those whom<br />\nshe feels are academically<br />\nqualified because, according to<br />\nher, \"there is no use wasting your<br />\ntime on a kid who can't get in the<br />\nfront door.\" Then she starts contacting prospects and keeps contacting them until she feels they<br />\nmay no longer have an interest in<br />\nattending the school. Once she<br />\nhas narrowed this list down further, she goes and sees potential<br />\nprospects play several times or<br />\nwatches videotapes of games. In<br />\nthis process, she tries not to limit<br />\n<br />\nherself to merely the northeast<br />\nand covers as much of the country as possible. Once she has seen<br />\nher recruits, she, like Nelson and<br />\nother coaches, drafts a ranked list<br />\nof her recruited applicants and<br />\nthen waits and hopes they are<br />\nadmitted.<br />\nFor Nelson, the process is<br />\nmuch the same. Also relying on<br />\nsources such as Metro Index,<br />\nvisiting summer camps, personal<br />\ncontacts, and responding to student inquiries, Nelson sends out<br />\nover 200 questionairres contacting prospective student-athletes.<br />\n'About one quarter of those return<br />\nthe questionairre, and an additional quarter choose to apply. Of<br />\nthose dozen players, Nelson tries<br />\nto watch as many as possible<br />\nplay. Of the rest, he and his staff<br />\nreview videotapes which the<br />\nplayers send. According to<br />\nNelson, he will have seen next<br />\nyear's top recruit play six times<br />\nthis year.<br />\nNelson does not mass recruit,<br />\nhowever, but rather selectively<br />\nattempts to fill specific needs in<br />\nhis line-up. According to Nelson,<br />\nthe year before he arrived, eight<br />\nseniors graduated, leaving him<br />\nwith only one returning starter his<br />\nfirst year, who was also a senior<br />\nand the team's leading scorer.In<br />\nsearch of a point guard, Nelson<br />\nrecruited Dave Eikenberg and<br />\nDave Strong, and needing a<br />\nscorer, found Andy Enfield, who<br />\nis currently on track to be<br />\nHopkins all-time leading scorer.<br />\nThis year, to back up seniors<br />\nMike Latimore and Jedan<br />\n<br />\nFirst Quarter: 2:39-Syracuse: Zulberti<br />\nfrom Burns; 3:38-Syracuse: Marachek<br />\nfrom Zulberti; 3:54-Hopkins: Rzempoluch<br />\nunassisted; 4:52-Syracuse: Scaramuzzino<br />\nfrom Zulberti; 6:47-Hopkins: Panetta<br />\nunassisted; 7:54-Hopkins: Panetta<br />\nunassisted; 9:30-Syracuse: Hall<br />\nunassisted; 10:52-Hopkins: Wilkens<br />\nunassisted; 11:41-Syracuse: G.

Unfortunately, his<br />\nmicrophone failed momentarily<br />\nand this reporter was unable to<br />\nclearly hear his full statement.<br />\nFielding questions about the<br />\norigin of the position switch,<br />\nMuller and Henry had different<br />\nstories about whose idea it had<br />\nbeen. Muller said that he had<br />\noften thought of switching palces<br />\nwith a student.<br />\nHenry, on the other hand, said<br />\n<br />\nthat one night he.had had a<br />\ndream, in which Shirley MacClaine appeared to him as a bouquet of flowers and told him to<br />\nstage a coup, deposing Muller.<br />\nHenry, a pacifist, was taken<br />\naback at the thought of a possibly<br />\nviolent revolution, but decided to<br />\ndiscuss the matter with Muller.<br />\nHe is, however, considering<br />\nwriting a work of fiction about<br />\nsuch a coup, entitled Botanic<br />\nVerses.<br />\nBoth Muller and Henry<br />\nvehemently denied that they were<br />\nbeing forced to make the switch.<br />\nAllegations had been made that<br />\nMuller was under pressure to<br />\nmove from \"high officials in East<br />\nBaltimore,\" while it was insinuated that Henry was under<br />\nsimilar pressure from both Student Council and certain<br />\nmembers of the News-Letter<br />\neditorial board.<br />\nReaction around campus to the<br />\n<br />\nannouncement was divided.<br />\n\"Frankly, I'm a little disappointed,\" remarked Dean of<br />\nStudents Susan Boswell,'one of<br />\nHenry's employers. \"The little<br />\nsneak, uh, I mean, Mr. Henry,<br />\nhad said he was going to switch<br />\nplaces with me! Now I'm going<br />\nto continue to be stuck in<br />\nmeetings all day.<br />\n\"I know he's stuck in<br />\nmeetings a lot also, but at least he<br />\ngets to play Nintendo in the<br />\nResidential Life Staff Lounge,\"<br />\nshe went on. \"I was really looking forward to playing 'Super<br />\nMario Brothers' all afternoon,<br />\ntoo.\"<br />\nNews-Letter Editors-in-Chief<br />\nFlory Ware and Kathleen McCarthy, on the other hand, were very<br />\nexcited for Henry. While Ware<br />\nwas laughing too hard to be<br />\ncoherent, McCarthy was clear in<br />\nher approval of the switch. \"Of<br />\ncourse we think it's a good idea;<br />\n<br />\nnow that he's President, we'll<br />\nnever see his obsequious little<br />\nface down here again!\"<br />\nAmong others who were happy about the switch were the<br />\nVice-President for Institutional<br />\nRelations Joseph \"Jackie\" Hall,<br />\nand his assistant Esthel Summerfield, two more of Henry's employers. (Conservative estimates<br />\nplace Henry's number of parttime jobs at just under 150.)<br />\n\"We're very proud of Bill,\"<br />\nsaid Summerfield. \"He does such<br />\na great job of answering our<br />\nphones,<br />\ndelivering<br />\nour<br />\nmail . . . I'm sure he'll make a<br />\ngreat president!\"<br />\nHall agreed, lamenting the loss<br />\nof Muller. \"I'm sure Steve will<br />\nbe happier out among the<br />\nstudents, but we'll still miss him<br />\nup here,\" he said. \"Maybe he<br />\ncould come by every now and<br />\nthen. You know, now that Bill's<br />\ngone, we're going to need<br />\nsomebody to answer phones during lunch time . . . .\"<br />\nNot only was provost and<br />\npresidential aspirant John Lombardi unavailable for comment,<br />\nbut no one in his office would<br />\nspeak to this reporter. A secretary<br />\ndown the hall claimed that Lombardi was not taking the news<br />\nwell.<br />\n\"As soon as he heard, he went<br />\n<br />\ninto his office and slammed the<br />\ndoor.\" she said. \"We could hear<br />\nhim stamping on the floor and<br />\nbreaking things, shouting 'It's not<br />\nfair! It's not fair! It's my turn.<br />\nIt's my turn!' I think he'll calm<br />\ndown in a couple of weeks,<br />\nthough.\"<br />\nAsked what innovations each<br />\nexpected to bring to his new position, both Muller anbd Henry<br />\nseemed enthusiastic. \"Well,\"<br />\nbegan Muller, \"I think the first<br />\nthing student Council and the<br />\nClass of 1990 need is a radio station. As soon as the Junior Class<br />\nfinishes selling the boxer shorts,<br />\nI'll make some calls to th eFCC.<br />\nHmm. maybe I should run for<br />\nsenior class president, too...<br />\nHenry, laughing, said that he<br />\nalso had been planning on running for senior class president, but<br />\nnow, he would get to talk at<br />\ngraduation anyway. \"But<br />\nseriously,\" continued Henry,<br />\n\"there's so many things to fix<br />\nabout Hopkins, I'm not sure<br />\nwhere to begin. Actually, I know<br />\nexactly where to begin . . .\"Henry<br />\nwent on to make some remarks<br />\nabout a new student unioun, the<br />\nHopkins Club, and Jay Engler<br />\nhaving a good idea, but at that<br />\npoint, his microphone failed<br />\npermanently.<br />\n<br />\n616.

Eisenhower's Garrett Room<br />\nyesterday.<br />\nHasan Abdel Rahman, director of the<br />\nPalestinian Affairs Center of the League<br />\nof Arab States and chief U.S. spokesman<br />\nfor the PLO, contended that a politieal settlement establishing a self-governed<br />\nPalestinian state is necessary because \"the<br />\nPalestinians cannot defeat the Israelis and<br />\nthe Israelis cannot defeat the Palestinians.\"<br />\nHe claimed that PLO Chairman Yassir<br />\nArafat's recent \"peace\" initiatives are<br />\n\"the only opportunity that presents the<br /><br />\nIsraelis with a chance to be a legitimate<br />\npart of the Middle East.\"<br />\nRahman, who hailed Arafat's renunciation of terrorism in November as a \"most<br />\nrevolutionary decision, a bold and<br />\ncourageous step\" signifying a \"maturation<br />\nof thinking\" in the PLO,equated the \"suffering borne by the Palestinian people\"<br />\nduring the Intifada, the Palestinian name<br />\nfor the uprising in Israeli-occupied territories, as being \"more in relative terms<br />\nthan what the United States suffered in<br />\nVietnam.\"<br />\nEmphasizing a need that \"peace be<br />\npredicated on equality and mutual<br />\nrespect,\" he presented Israel with the<br />\nultimatum that it either \"negotiate, or face<br />\na conflict with the entire Arab world.\"<br />\nAccording to Rahman, the Intifada was<br />\na \"Palestinian-Israeli conflict, not an ArabIsraeli one.\" This misconception was the<br />\nreason the Arab world viewed former<br /><br />\nAlexia Lennon<br /><br />\nPLO representative Hasan Abdel Rahman, professor Robert Freedman, moderator Steven<br />\nDavid, and Israeli professor Shlomo Slonim discussed the Palestinian-Israeli conflict yesterday.<br /><br />\nEgyptian President Anwar Sadat as a<br />\n\"traitor\" when he signed the Sinai Accords. In contrast, he said, Arabs view<br />\nArafat as a \"hero\" for trying to reach an<br />\naccord with Israel.<br />\nRahman proposed the establishment of<br />\nan \"international conference in order to<br />\nguarantee rights\" so that a nation with<br />\n\"open borders,\" not a \"Berlin Wall,\"be<br />\nestablished.<br />\nRobert Freedman, professor of political<br />\nscience at Baltimore Hebrew University<br />\nand a supporter of the establishment of a<br />\nPalestinian state, described such a creation<br />\nas the lesser of many evils. He referred to<br />\nseveral Israeli officials, including the chief<br />\nof the Israeli Defense Forces, who advocate a necessity of employing a political<br />\nsolution, rather than a military solution, to<br />\nthe problem.<br />\nFreedman said the establishment of a<br />\nPalestinian state should be based on several<br />\nadditional conditions, however. Freedman<br />\nsaid the PLO should demilitarize the West<br />\nBank and Gaza Strip. He added that the<br />\nPLO should abrogate the Palestinian National Covenant, the PLO constitution,<br />\nwhich contains clauses legitimizing<br />\narmed struggle against Israel, a PLO commitment to the annihilation of Israel, and<br />\nthe creation of a Palestinian state in<br />\npre-1948 boundaries.<br />\nRelating some of the discussions he had<br />\nwith Palestinian leaders during his recent<br />\ntrip to Tunisia, Freedman said an international conference discussing the situation<br />\nmight be fruitful because of a \"willingness<br />\non the part of the PLO leadership to engage<br />\nin detailed discussions with the Israelis, in<br />\nsecret or in public, to work out a<br />\nframework for ratification.\"<br />\nFreedom suggested a \"Benelux\"-type<br />\nsettlement establishing open borders and<br />\ncultural and economic exchange between<br />\nseparate Palestinian and Israeli states. He<br /><br />\nfurther challenged Palestinians to \"address<br />\nIsrael directly [without resorting to] a<br />\npolitical end-run by pressuring the U.S.<br />\nand Europeans.\"<br />\nU.S. participation similar to that during<br />\nthe Camp David accords, he continued, is<br />\nnecessary to mediate any negotiations,<br />\nwhile Soviet participation might undermine<br />\nthe spirit of negotiation and heighten superpower tensions.<br />\nShlomo Slonim, professor of International Relations at Hebrew University of<br />\nJerusalem and a supporter of official Israeli<br />\nolicy toward the Intifada, asserted that the<br />\nIsraeli people are the \"one people<br />\nthreatened with annihilation. The Israelis<br />\nwould be willing to grant the Palestinians<br />\nself-determination if they would be willing to recognize Israeli selfdetermination.\"<br />\nSlonim admonished the Palestinians for<br />\n\"speaking in Orwellian double-speak,<br />\neither by word or by deed.\" The PLO, he<br />\nwent on, has continued attacks on Israel's<br />\nnorthern border. When the mayor of<br />\nBethlehem suggested the PLO call a halt<br />\nto the Intifada and Israel negotiate a<br />\npolitical settlement to the crisis, continued<br />\nSlonim, Arafat said, \"Anybody who<br />\nmakes the suggestion of interrupting the Intifada war against Israel will get ten bullets<br />\nin his chest.\"<br />\nRahman later contended that this statement was the result of an \"Israeli propaganda machine.\"<br />\nSlonim passionately pleaded the necessity of the PLO's renouncing the Palestinian<br />\nNational Covenant, which he said \"endorses national liberation struggle against<br />\nIsrael\" and denounces Israel suppression<br />\nof the uprisings as \"state terrorism.\"<br />\nSlonim said he was not precluding \"advances toward peace\" but warned that<br />\nIsrael should guard against the PLO's using \"war diplomacy by other means.'<br />\n1<br /><br />\nLAST CHANCE<br /><br />\nGETIT<br />\nWHIE rrsHOT<br /><br />\nFor those of you who are .interested in<br />\napplying for the admissions representative positions available for the fall of<br />\n1989 in the Office of Admissions, you<br />\nmust apply immediately.

Mello<br />\nnamed two factors with which the<br />\nstate is concerned: the health of<br />\nthe mother and the life of the<br />\nbaby. Mello said state intervention should be based on the \"irrational basis test,\" following<br />\nalong the lines that \"when the<br />\ncourt finds a right that is fundamentally crucial to an individual, it can infringe upon that<br />\nright only if there is compelling<br />\ninterest.\"<br />\nAccording to present abortion<br />\nlaws, the state cannot prohibit<br />\nabortion in the first trimester of<br />\npregnancy. The decision to abort<br />\ncan be made by the woman, in<br />\nconsultation with a physician,<br />\nwithout state interference. In later<br />\nstages of pregnancy, states may<br />\nregulate abortions to protect the<br />\nlife of the mother.<br />\nIn the final stage, after the fetus<br />\nbecomes viable outside the<br />\nwomb, states may prohibit<br />\nabortions.<br />\nAfter Mello presented this information, she answered questions from the twenty students in<br />\nattendance.<br />\nOne student simply asked why<br /><br />\nthe abortion controversy is never<br />\nresolved. \"It's probably the<br />\nreligious reasons that get people<br />\nstirred up,\" Mello replied. \"If<br />\nyou really believe that killing an<br />\nunborn fetus is murder, then you<br />\ncan't relax. The issue won't die.\"<br />\nAnother student was concerned with the moral premise of<br />\nabortion and asked why Missouri<br />\nis not also considering the<br />\neconomic well-being of the<br />\nmother. Mello agreed that this<br />\nseeming lack of concern is an inconsistency in state policy that<br />\nhas no definite solution.<br />\nMello also discussed how safer<br />\nabortion techniques and improved<br />\npre-natal care might affect the<br />\ntrimester plan. Medical advances<br />\nshould make the trimester plan<br />\nmore acceptable to abortion foes,<br />\nshe contended. Mello called the<br />\ntrimester plan \"mathematically<br />\nconvenient\" and hoped that<br />\nSupreme Court Associate Justice<br />\nSandra Day O'Connor will<br />\nabolish it.<br />\nMello is apprehensive about the<br />\ndecision in the Missouri case<br />\nbecause of potential \"implications on the changing status of<br />\nwomen.\" She said the changing<br />\npersonnel of the Court presents a<br />\ndefinite possibility for an overruling of Roe.<br />\nChief Justice William Rehnquist and Associate Justice Antonin Scalia seem to advocate a<br />\nreturn of the power to regulate<br />\nabortions to the states. According<br />\nto Mello, \"they would recognize<br />\nthe right to privacy but still say<br />\nthat it does not encompass the<br />\nright to terminate pregnancy<br />\nbecause of state interests.<br /><br />\nCAMPUS CRIME<br />\n*Complainant reports that<br />\nsometime between February<br />\n25 at 7 p.m. and February 26<br />\nat 5 p.m., someone removed<br />\na pair of tennis shoes from his<br />\napartment in Wolman Hall.<br />\nNo one knows how entry was<br />\ngained.

Let us<br />\nnot allow this phenomenon to lead us to<br />\ndeclare this year's elections unimportant, however. After all, this year's<br />\nvice-presidential campaign has shaped<br />\nup to be quite a heated race, with no less<br />\nthan three candidates each qualified<br />\nwithin his own right, contending for the<br />\nposition.<br />\nWhy, you ask, would a vice-presidential race attract so many candidates, and<br />\nwhy should it attract such interest? The<br />\nvice-president is important not so much<br />\nfor his individual contribution to Council's meaningful deliberations, for we<br />\nknow these to be few and far between.<br />\nRather, the position is significant for the<br />\npower it wields.<br />\nThe Council vice-president is chairman of the Committee on Committees,<br />\n(let not its enigmatic moniker mislead<br />\nyou) the body which appoints students<br />\nto some of the most influential<br />\nundergraduate positions on campus. Not<br /><br />\nonly are Spring Fair, MSE Symposium,<br />\nand Orientation chairs chosen by this<br />\ncommittee, but also some less visible<br />\nones, including the chair of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies and<br />\nthose of the HOP subcommittees, such<br />\nas the Social Committee and Union<br />\nBoard, to name a few.<br />\nThe vice-president, then, should be<br />\nchosen with care because he directly influences student life on campus. And,<br />\nif there's one thing that irks us, it's<br />\nlistening to the endless prattling of those<br />\nwho complain about people who are appointed to these positions. Constantly<br />\nheard on campus are such choice<br />\nremarks as \"They get the same people<br />\nevery year for these jobs,\" or \"That<br />\nloser!?!\" While granted, selections rely in large part upon the quality of the<br />\napplicant pool, the direction of the chair<br />\nof the selection committee can also play<br />\na pivotal role in choosing satisfactory<br />\nand appropriate candidates.<br />\nIf you can manage, then, to get to the<br />\nMSE on Tuesday, we would encourage<br />\nyou (especially the more vocally critical<br />\nof you)to cast informed votes\u2014not only for vice-president, but for Young<br />\nTrustee as well.

In<br />\nthe introduction entitled \"The<br />\nChallenge of Excellence\"<br />\nHopkins is described as a \"galaxy<br />\nwith two original stars, A&amp;S and<br />\nMedicine.\" A galaxy, says my<br />\nDictionary of Cultural Literacy,<br />\nis \"a large, self-contained mass<br />\nof stars. A common form for<br />\ngalaxies is a bright center with<br />\nspiral arms radiating outward.\"<br />\nA star is \"an object in the sky that<br />\nsends out its own light.

But do the Arts or<br />\neven the Sciences have an equal<br />\nchance at attracting funds and<br />\nproducing results with immediate<br />\ncash value\u2014compared to a<br />\nhospital or military research lab?<br />\nShould a university like Hopkins<br />\nreally be run as a profit-making<br />\nstore\u2014under the motto pecunia<br /><br />\nCampus Security appeared<br />\nnowhere in the article.

By the nature<br />\nof an evacuation, there is no way<br />\nto execute one other than 'poorly.' One must go through the<br /><br />\nvos liberabit? In other words:<br />\nWill the history of the crisis<br />\nrepeat itself because this underlying structural problem has not<br />\nbeen addressed?<br />\n2) In many West German<br />\nuniversities, students(who do not<br />\neven pay tuition) have a quarter<br />\nof the votes in academic and administrative bodies. In a country<br />\nso proud of its democratic tradition, at a university so proud of<br />\nits foundation on the German<br />\nmodel, it should be possible to<br />\ngrant current students (graduate<br />\nand undergraduate from all divisions) a voice if not a vote in all<br />\ndecision-making bodies (including the Board of Trustees,<br />\nwhere the Young Trustees, who<br />\nare in fact young alumni, are supposed to represent the Homewood<br />\nundergraduates).<br /><br />\nwe aliPEA'SIAA/P 71/47- ONE NAINE<br />\nIIA/L-IkELV To SE fils-s-Ep evER 1.161/7zy<br />\nko/EN coA/simeiN6 ITEs-/PEA/TMazes<br />\nSUCCESSoR 15 p/Ar or feovor JO*<br /><br />\nSee LETTERS, 8<br />\ns000es povest- owe HAS<br />\nTAN,<br />\n-F<br />\n9C<br />\n-N RiAIWIN6 THU 's PAY-To-PAY Ar-<br /><br />\ntortIOARPT..-<br /><br />\nWHAT Po WANT lo AAkv<br />\nAl39UT 1-041114RD.1, Jr<br />\n601,<br />\n46 7gea415 77-/E<br /><br />\ncAlliffiv or MY DEBT-<br /><br />\nrAlg FoR Moro's: comEs Fkoti p/Aor<br />\n546k-G,ecutip<br />\nMiGor CALL 7NE<br />\nPA N fflin fr1154Lril, LcMiiing's FATNO\u2014<br />\nRMKElF A uNivek51-TY PREciPENr\u2014 MADE<br />\nSURE -THAT JoNN, Jr. TASTED csii-Y OF PIE<br />\ngESr\u201e.GeADE cQAoL AT -rAtiAregeo, Cum<br />\n1.AuD6 FROitl felificemtv, 11e/A10(5<br />\nfteEer<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\n0/441805....<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nRIDPEN INS77ru7laV<br />\nOF 1/61/ER lEARN/Nq<br />\nLE5LEY CYA#L?<br /><br />\nJan Linders<br />\nGRO Representative<br />\nThe writer is a member of The<br />\nDepartment of German.<br />\n'Arr TYE OUESTioAl FOR /*VW /r0P1.4:<br />\nw, js 77/15,Or 044r USE W Av./80'1'1'5 BA CeGeOUND &lt;56 To Tollivs-<br /><br />\nSecurity distress<br />\nTo the Editors:<br /><br />\ngopovs uNikeEnr-Y<br /><br />\nCIP (40P<br />\nL<br />\n(<br /><br />\nPO/Air OUT 7I-14r Jr WeED Fol?<br />\nVIE PRESIDENCY 1,9,445A1721\" cow gE<br />\nCOWTEP ON r9 AZ\"Pt ii;v6HTsaPs FrviVE<br />\nHoek-Ws AN/WALLY,BY (.1.57N6 71/6 SAME<br />\nmc-105 HES USED TH,fou&amp;HOW-Acmosr<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nNi(t ht<br />\n(140<br /><br />\n8 1041MINNINUMMIIIMNIMIW<br />\n.<br /><br />\nin.<br /><br />\nPoN'eleo LJE Ale;<br />\nAWN- APP.1!<br />\ntvoiep<br /><br />\nyou 6or Mat ruificit/<br />\n110<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n;4-ryy<br /><br />\nPPM-ME-YEAR WEER AT<br /><br />\n44,,V<br /><br />\nThursday after<br />\nSpring Break!<br />\n1M<br /><br />\nHE ProiliSrS'91.11\"-<br /><br />\nR0er<br /><br />\nI would like to take this opportunity to express my distress<br />\nabout the article, Bomb threat<br />\nforces evacuation (News-Letter,<br />\n24 February 1989). This article<br />\nwas done, in my opinion, in very<br />\npoor taste, and seemed almost<br />\ndesigned to once again criticize<br />\nCampus Security.<br />\nFirst of all, the viewpoint of<br /><br />\ne(e) (I) ae<br /><br />\nM<br /><br />\nty only dispatches an ambulance<br />\nand a fire truck. The police are<br />\nnot called until it is determined<br />\nthat they are needed on the scene.<br />\nSecond, there were several bomb<br />\nthreats around Baltimore City<br />\nduring that time. Whether the City handled them on a \"first-come,<br /><br />\nLESLEY<br /><br />\nFunk Night is<br /><br />\n4141.1M<br /><br />\nbuilding and get everyone out as<br />\nquickly as possible. There is an<br />\nadded hindrance that neither the<br />\nwalkie-talkies or the fire alarms<br />\ncan be used during a bomb scare,<br />\nsince each has the potential to<br />\ndetonate an explosive.

Her reporting was entirely<br />\nsatisfactory, particularly in light<br />\nof the severe time restraints our<br />\nproduction schedule imposed on<br />\nher.<br /><br />\nDebate continues...<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nSome of you may have noticed<br />\nthe latest gimmick from CR Greg<br />\nFrancis: a petition requesting that<br />\nthe Chaplain and her employees<br />\n\"limit their activities to the realm<br />\nof the religious; that is, to those<br />\nareas that have direct bearing on<br />\nthe spiritual welfare and the<br />\nreligious faith of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.- Although I strongly<br />\noppose the CR's tactics on the<br />\nChaplain, I nevertheless urge all<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins corn-<br /><br />\nmunity to sign this petition. Now<br />\nyou may be asking, well, Mr.<br />\nJohnston, what gives? Simple: the<br />\nCR's continue to misunderstand<br />\nthe nature of the issue. This,<br />\ndespite the fact that they are the<br />\nones who made it an issue in the<br />\nfirst place.<br />\nAs I pointed out in my letter of<br />\nFebruary 10th, everybody agrees<br />\nthat the Chaplain should limit her<br />\nactivities to the realm of the<br />\nreligious. That is no issue at all.<br />\nThus, since the CR's have called<br />\nfor no more than what we have<br />\nalready agreed upon, how can we<br />\ndo anything but affirm our agreement'? In fact, I find it a little difficult to see how anyone could<br />\nrefuse to sign this petition.<br />\nDoes this mean that the CR's<br />\nand I are now in total agreement<br />\non the issue of the Chaplain? Far<br />\nfrom it. The real issue is not<br />\nshould the Chaplain limit herself<br />\nto religious activities. Rather, the<br />\nreal issue is, who decides what<br />\nactivities do and don't count as<br />\nreligious? Should this issue be<br />\ndecided by a political group\u2014the<br />\nRepublicans\u2014dictating what<br />\ncounts as religon? (Hello Russia?)<br />\nOr should we follow the Founding Fathers and leave it up to a<br />\nreligious figure\u2014the Chaplain\u2014<br />\nto determine what counts as a<br />\nreligious activity? Somehow this<br />\nissue is never addressed by the<br />\npetition (in fact, the CR's have<br />\nyet to address this issue). So sign<br />\nthe petition and oppose the CR's<br />\nattempt to dictate religion.<br /><br />\npseudo: of having what you ask for<br />\nPSEUDO, from 6<br /><br />\nthey will not renovate and move<br />\nthe Grad Club if it is not viable<br />\nbeforehand.<br />\nThe booming success of Thursday and Friday nights shows that<br />\nthe Grad Club can be made to<br />\nwork if only students are interested, and it may be that there<br />\nhas just been a poor understanding of the nature of the Club<br />\namong undergraduates lately.<br />\nIf you have ideas about what<br />\ncould be done to increase interest<br />\nin the Grad Club earlier in the<br />\nweek<br />\n(Tuesdays<br />\nand<br />\nWednesdays, which are crucial<br />\ndays financially), talk to Shelley<br />\nAlbrecht in the Student Activities<br />\nOffice. The News-Letter's Funk<br />\nNight experience suggests that<br />\nshe is flexible and interested, but<br />\nthe low level of student feedback<br />\nhas made it difficult to decide<br />\nwhat people are really interested<br />\nin.<br />\nMost importantly, we should<br />\nstart to look at the Grad Club for<br />\nwhat it is: at least the equal\u2014and<br />\nprobably the better\u2014of the AMR<br />\nSnack Bar, Pis, or CVP as a<br />\n\u2022 place to wind down from the<br />\nlibrary late at night, or to grab<br />\nsome food in between reserve<br />\nreadings.<br />\nBut the most important thing<br />\nabout the success of the Grad<br />\nClub is that it really is one of the<br />\nSteve Johnson few<br />\ntraditions,<br />\nHopkins<br /><br />\nacademics aside, that we can all<br />\nenjoy. Hopkins has too few things<br />\nthat have lasted so long that an<br />\nalum could identify with an<br />\nundergrad today. It would be a<br />\nshame if we couldn't make this<br />\none work out in the long run.<br />\nAs the undergraduate population at Hopkins continues to expand, the need for places like the<br />\nGrad Club will increase proportionately. But as anyone who has<br />\nfought for anything expensive and<br />\nnew here can attest, restarting<br />\nsomething like the Grad Club<br />\nstarted again after it has been<br />\nclosed would be much easier said<br />\nthan done. Not to mention that the<br />\nClub has a unique personality to<br />\nit, something which takes time to<br />\nachieve\u2014a psychedelic paint job<br />\nand wainscotting is not what the<br />\never-generous Young Alumni<br />\nwould probably have in mind in<br />\ntheir decorating plans.<br />\nSo go to the Grad Club, open<br />\nTuesday through Friday. If more<br />\npeople go to things like Tuesday's<br />\nMovie Night, the number of open<br />\nnights will increase, and the<br />\nClub's future will be more<br />\nsecure. It's our ball, Hopkins,<br />\nand the Grad Club is for you. Go.<br />\nfloor is just the right size for the<br />\nnumber of people we usually<br />\ndraw, and there are pinball games<br />\nand tables in the back for people<br />\nwho need a break from getting<br />\ndown.<br />\nThis is why it's hard to unders-<br /><br />\n\u2022:\u2022\u2022:\u2022 \u2022:\u2022\u2022:. \u2022:- \u2022:\u2022\u2022:\u2022<br /><br />\nAttention Seniors &amp;<br />\nGraduate Students:<br />\nIf you are completing your degree this year and<br />\nhave not registered with the Office of Career<br />\nCounseling and Placement, please stop by 224A<br />\nMergenthaler Hall as soon as possible.

There is nothing Pi's offers that the Grad Club doesn't,<br />\nand the fact is that the Club needs<br />\nour patronage, whereas PJ's<br />\ncould live without it.<br />\nThis is becoming a more pressing issue for two reasons. On the<br />\none hand, the University is going<br />\nthrough the financial straights we<br />\nhave all been having rammed<br />\ndown our throats lately, and the<br />\nchances of their continuing to<br />\nfund a money-losing proposition<br />\nfor long are slim.

This Waverly food vendor is Baltimore's only<br />\nnatural food storefront co-op, and its members are seriously committed to providing good food to the local<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe Belly is not run for profit; if it did turn a profit,<br />\nthe proceeds, as member Mark Snesil noted, \"would have<br />\nto be given away.\" Food bought on sale is sold on sale,<br />\nand prices may not rise until weeks after inflation has hit.<br />\nGussie Tweedy, a four-year member of The Belly, recalled selling bagels for six weeks below cost.<br />\nAll the food at The Belly is vegetarian, although<br />\nTweedy admitted to sometimes sneaking in salmon or<br />\ntuna. The selection filled food and flours is extensive,<br />\nranging from pe,arleu parley, kasha and organic buckwheat<br />\nflour to organic black turtle beans and lentils. Organic,<br />\nexplained Tweedy, actually does mean more than high<br />\nprices: certified organic food must be grown in soil not<br /><br />\nfertilized by chemicals in two years. Distributors\u2022are<br />\nresponding to the increased demand for chemical-free<br />\nfood; as their organic stock increases, prices may drop<br />\naccordingly.<br />\nFruits and vegetables at The Belly are more mundane:<br />\napples, onions, and potatoes are standard stock. Canned<br />\nand jarred foods are sparse and highly-priced: a 25 oz.<br />\njar of sugar-free applesauce cost $1.72, in comparison<br />\nwith $.89 at Eddie's.

Individuals can become<br />\nmembers by paying $15 and, if they choose, by working<br />\na minimum of three hours per month at the store.<br />\nMembers can also work at The Belly without paying a<br />\nfee. The Belly currently claims approximately one hundred members; approximately twenty members are<br />\nHopkins students. New members, said Snesil, are<br /><br />\nwelcome, \"not just from the consumer end but as an active voice as to what the store can be for everyone. We<br />\nhave lots of room to grow.\" New members join the coop by attending one of Snesil's biweekly orientation<br />\nmeetings; signup sheets are posted in the store.<br />\nThe Belly was founded in 1975 by students as a means<br />\nto provide cheaper food, without the cost of paid labor.<br />\nLack of storage space prevents the co-op from buying food<br />\nat bulk rates, but food is always sold at the lowest possible prices. Members work when they want to; consequently, the atmosphere is caring and relaxed. As Tweedy<br />\nnoted, \"We provide an essential service. . .everybody<br />\nneeds food.\"<br />\nFor variety and freshness in dried foods, flours, and<br />\nspices, The Belly can't be beat, although I would recommend shopping elsewhere for canned goods and produce.<br />\nYou can find The Belly at 427 East 31st Street.

Perhaps some of you have begun to wonder why<br />\nin the world you are still here, or even why you came<br />\nin the first place. Isn't there some less painful way, you<br />\nwonder, for a student to acquire useful information on<br />\nhis or her way to becoming a contributing member of<br />\nsociety? Unfortunately, the simple, distressing fact is that<br />\nmost classes here at Hopkins are designed to force the<br />\nrequired material into the heads of us unwilling victims<br />\nwith the maximum amount of pain possible.<br />\nFortunately, there do exist alternative methods of learning, methods that don't necessarily require that one submit to the rigors of the classroom. I have recently become<br />\nacquainted with one such alternative. It is the<br />\nUndergraduate Reading, sponsored by the Writing<br />\nSeminars Department.<br />\nEvery Monday night at about six or seven-thirty, a<br />\ngroup of people meet in the Little Theatre in Levering<br />\nHall to listen to various students read their prose and<br />\npoetry aloud. The program is co-chaired by two<br />\nundergraduates, Jenny Levy and Louise Redd, both<br />\nWriting Seminars majors. I had the opportunity to talk<br />\nto both of them and to attend the two most recent programs of the series.<br />\nThe programs were started about ten years ago by the<br />\nlate Dr. Robert Arellano, who was concerned about providing an opportunity for students to receive criticism on<br />\ntheir writing from peers outside of the classroom environment. Since then it has been sponsored by various pro-<br /><br />\nfessors in the Writing Seminars department up until the<br />\ncurrent sponsor, Jean McGarry, who was previously a<br />\ngraduate student in the department. Both Redd and Levy<br />\ncommented that the interest that McGarry has shown has<br />\nbeen very encouraging.<br />\nRedd stressed that any undergraduate who felt the desire<br />\nto read was welcome to do so, and also expressed the<br />\ndesire that the attendance to the programs was larger and<br />\nmore consistent. Anyone who wants to read can contact<br />\none of the co-chairs as little as a week in advance of the<br />\ndesired reading date and still be assured of consideration.<br />\nAt both programs I attended, I was particularly struck<br />\nby the relaxed atmosphere. Nobody seemed conscious of<br />\nthe passage of time, and a few minutes stretched easily<br />\nand unnoticeably into five or ten. During the break, people wandered into little groups talking and laughing, or<br />\njust lounged on the chairs, smoking cigarettes. Over in<br />\none corner, a girl started to bang on the piano, while in<br />\nanother, two guys discussed going out for a drink<br />\nafterwards.<br />\nThe stories and poems were interesting and absorbing,<br />\ndealing with subjects as varied as the people who read<br />\nthem were different. A junior philosophy major read a<br />\nnumber of her poems on African and Asian love themes,<br />\nwhile a senior football player read a story about a downon-his-luck private eye. Another senior, like the football<br />\nplayer in the writing seminars department, read some witty letters written to him by a friend, as well as an excellent<br />\nstory about a journalist going through significant changes<br />\nin his life. There was a story about the sweetness of<br />\nrevenge, and a particularly humorous one concerning an<br />\nanalysis of the various methods of vomiting.<br />\nBut back to the central problem: the ability of a stu-<br /><br />\nMike Blumhardt<br /><br />\nJonathan Abrahams presents his work at a reading held<br />\ntwo<br />\nweeks ago.<br /><br />\ndent to learn without effort. How does the program help<br />\naccomplish this? For one thing, it provides an opportunity for a student in some of the more time-consuming majors to become acquainted with an outlook on life that is<br />\nperhaps entirely different from what he or she is accustomed to. This can be a valuable learning experience for<br />\nanyone. It gives a student a chance to make new friends<br />\nwho can be very different from those he or she is used to.<br />\nOf course, it also gives the students a chance to become<br />\nacquainted with the ways different people express<br />\nthemselves, and thereby, to become somewhat acquainted<br />\nwith the writers themselves. Most importantly, any learning that takes place there occurs practically effortlessly, and only requires that one be reasonably observant.<br />\nRemember, the cold, hard fact is that we are here at<br />\ncollege to learn.

At almost<br />\nall large universities, only<br />\ngraduate students have the chance<br />\nto do research. At Hopkins, many<br />\nundergraduates can be found in<br />\nthe labs at both Homewood Campus and at the Medical School.<br />\nSo. how do you find a research<br />\njob?<br />\nFirst of all, you must decide in<br />\nwhat areas you would like to<br />\nwork. Research can get awfully<br />\nboring if you're in an area that<br />\ndoes not interest you. Says one<br />\nundergraduate biology researcher, \"[Research] is doubleedged because you can really get<br />\ninto it and more interested in the<br />\nfield, or you can get bored out of<br />\nyour mind.\" The area you choose<br />\nis also important because the way<br />\nto approach applying for a job<br />\ndiffers from departement to<br />\ndepartment. For example,<br />\nstudents interested in psychology<br />\nresearch are advised to see the<br />\nlistings on the bulletin board<br />\nAmes Hall. In the Biomedica)<br />\nEngineering department, an<br />\naspiring student researcher should<br />\ngo from lab to lab and ask. Professors recommend that you have<br />\na resume available so that they<br />\ncan remember you. A student<br />\nworking in the Oncology department at the Medical School says<br />\nthat he just gave his resume to the<br /><br />\ndepartment secretary and she then primarily consisted of menial credit, the credit can apply<br />\ncirculated it within the depart- tasks like making solutions, towards your major or perhaps as<br />\nment.

Were it not<br />\nfor the multimillion dollar<br />\npricetag slapped on his head by<br />\nIslamic crazies, his message in<br />\nthe address would undoubtedly<br />\necho statements from his latest<br />\nbook, The Satanic Verses:<br />\n\"Language is courage: the ability to conceive a thought, to speak<br />\nit, and by doing so make it true.\"<br />\nIndeed, Rushdie's sudden prominence in the international<br />\nmedia has turned him into nothing<br />\nless than a cause, a rallying point<br />\nfor American writers on behalf of<br />\nliterary and religious freedoms.<br />\nNever before has a writer had to<br />\ncontend with the notoriety accompanying an international smear<br />\ncampaign and face the prospect of<br />\nliterary martyrdom.<br />\nThe politics surrounding<br />\nSatanic Verses have tended to<br />\novershadow any serious attempt<br />\nto discuss the book as literature.<br />\nWhen the second printing makes<br />\nthe book widely available once<br />\nagain [Ed. note: the Barnes and<br />\nNoble outlet on campus now has<br />\ncopies of the novel in stock], people will purchase (and perhaps<br />\neven read) this long, dense book<br />\nfor the wrong reasons: namely, to<br />\nassert one's individual literary<br />\nfreedom (a reason as suspect as<br />\nLarry Flynt's battle cry, in the<br />\nwake of the Meese Commission<br />\nReport, for people to purchase<br />\nPlayboy and other skin mags to<br />\nexpress belief in freedom of<br />\nliterary expression); or to read it<br />\nonly for the blaspheming parts, to<br />\nsee \"if it's as bad as they say it<br />\nis.\" It is the unfortunate fate of<br />\nSatanic Verses to be remembered<br />\nfor the political furor it inspired<br />\nrather than the literary merits it<br />\nmay or may not have.<br />\nThe novel displays many of the<br />\nRushdie traits typical of books<br />\nlike Shame (1983). Lots of<br />\ndreams, lots of hyperbolic<br />\nviolence and scatology, lots of<br />\nconfrontation between Eastern<br />\nand Western culture (which is<br />\nhardly surprising, given that<br />\nRushdie was born in India,<br />\neducated in Britain, and has a<br />\nfamily living in Pakistan), lots of<br /><br />\nvulgarity (which really stands<br />\nagainst the elegant, ornate prose<br />\nstyle) and lots of characters (my<br />\nlist filled five pages). The book<br />\nhas an epic quality to it; it is loaded with stories-within-stories that<br />\nare loosely connected to each<br />\nother at best, and it contains its<br />\nfair share of authorial asides.<br />\nPerhaps the most jarring thing<br />\nabout the book is how it alternates<br />\nfrom a fairy-tale mode full of talk<br />\nabout the Flintstones, the Rolling<br />\nStones, and Tinkerbell, not to<br />\nmention the Bhopal disaster,<br />\nMaggie Thatcher, and idioms like<br />\n\"That's the ticket\" and \"F---ing<br /><br />\n\"It is the unfortunate<br />\nfate of Satanic Verses<br />\nto be remembered for<br />\nthe political furor it inspired rather than for<br />\nthe literary merits it<br />\nmay or may not have.\"<br />\nA.\"<br />\nThe novel starts off with a<br />\nmarvelous premise: two people<br />\nfalling in midair from a plane<br />\n29,002 feet up. The rest of the<br />\nnovel recounts their fallout with<br />\neach other after both of them<br />\nmiraculously survive the fall<br />\n(\"Let's face it,\" says the narrator; \"it was impossible...how,<br />\ncould they? But let's face this,<br />\ntoo, they did.\"). The first is<br />\nGibreel Farishta, a widely acclaimed actor in \"theologicals,\"<br />\nmovies depicting the lives of prophets and holy men. He is a<br />\nwomanizer and rather taken with<br />\nhimself; he has the propensity for<br />\nhaving strange religious dreams<br />\nas well as chronic halitosis. The<br />\n!other guy is Saladin Chamcha, an<br />\nactor in demand by radio and TV<br />\nfor his ability to imitate voices,<br />\nto know how a ketchup bottle<br />\nshould talk and what it would<br />\nwant to say. He also is a curmudgeon, dissatisfied with the<br />\n'coarseness of his mother country,<br />\nIndia, and his curmudgeon father,<br />\nwho treats him like a child<br />\nwithout toilet training. After the<br />\nfall, as luck will have it, Gibreel<br />\nenjoys the appearance of a golden<br />\nhalo over his head as well as great<br />\nsex from a mountain climber<br />\nnamed Alleluia Cone and a boost<br />\nin his acting career, stemming<br />\nfrorn his role in \"Friend!\" an<br />\nadaptation of Dickens's Our<br />\nMutual Friend.<br />\nChamcha, on the other hand, is<br />\nnot so lucky.

Nice decor,<br />\nthough. It shows Friday and<br />\nSaturday at 8 and 10:15 in<br />\nShriver Hall.<br />\nFor a change of pace, you may<br /><br />\nhis head, and every day he looks<br />\nmore and more like a goat. After<br />\nfalling from the sky, he is arrested, treated degradingly by the<br />\nBritish police (a statement by<br />\nRushdie on the racial relations in<br />\nBritain) and put into a hospital<br />\nfull of other dehumanized animals<br />\n(\"They [the British police] have<br />\nthe power of description, and we<br />\nsuccumb to the pictures they construct.\") His girlfriend, thinking<br />\nhim dead, starts sleeping with his<br />\nbest friend, leaving him no choice<br />\nbut to hide away in a desolate attic of a motel/cafe watching TV.<br />\nThis only skims the surface of<br />\nthe overly convoluted plot. And<br />\nit neglects to make mention of the<br />\ncountless number of dreams and<br />\nset pieces. Some of these episodes<br />\nare fascinating, but most of them<br />\nare quite dull. The main conflict<br />\nof the story, once you take away<br />\nall the chatter about London (called \"Ellowen Deeowen\"<br />\nthroughout the book) and the<br />\nreligious dreaming of Gibreel, is<br />\nChamcha's seething jealosy of<br />\nGibreel's good fortune after the<br />\nairplane fall. But wait, let's be<br />\nfair. The novel also tries to deal<br />\nwith many other conflicts, Most<br />\nnotably the one about Gibreel's<br />\nattempt to deal with his chronic<br />\ndreaming.<br />\nIn a crucial passage right after<br />\nthe allegedly blasphemous<br />\nMahound scene, Gibreel (who is<br />\nimagining the scene), finds he<br />\ncannot continue with this dream<br />\nwithout involving himself too<br />\ndeeply:<br />\n\"Gibreel: the dreamer, whose<br />\npoint of view is sometimes that of<br />\nthe camera and at other moments,<br />\nspectator. When he's a camera<br />\nthe pee oh vee is always on the<br />\nmove, he hates static shots, so<br />\nhe's floating up on a high crane<br />\nlooking down at the foreshortened figures of the actors, or he's<br />\nswooping down to stand invisibly<br />\nbetween them, turning slowly on<br />\nhis heel to achieve a three<br />\nhundred-and sixty degree<br />\npan. . . And then, without warning, Hazma says to Mahound:<br />\n\"Go ask Gibreel,\" and he, the<br />\ndreamer, feels his heart leaping<br />\nin alarm, who me? I'm supposed<br />\nto know the answers here? I'm<br />\nsitting here watching this picture<br />\nand now this actor points his<br />\nfingers out at me, who ever heard<br />\nthe like, who asks the bloody audience of a 'theological' to solve<br />\na bloody plot?\"<br />\nThe dreamer can assume one of<br /><br />\ntwo roles in his dreaming: that of<br />\npassive spectator, or that of active participant-creator. The<br />\nspectator-dreamer watches his<br />\ndreams without attempting to<br />\ncontrol them, and in doing so,<br />\nevades responsibility for the<br />\ndream's outcome; how can a<br />\nmoviegoer change what appears<br />\non the movie screen? The dream<br />\nprogresses naturally and is<br />\nautonomous of the viewer's attempt to direct it. But when the<br />\nc.,eam runs out of its own accord,<br />\nwhat can the dreamer do? He can<br />\ninsert his personal feelings into<br />\nthe dream to get it started once<br />\nagain while running the risk of<br />\nhaving it seem contrived. That is<br />\nwhat the historical fact of<br />\n\"satanic verses\" is all about.<br />\nMuhammad (\"Mahound- in the<br />\nbook), in a moment where he appears to exchange religious commitment for political expedience,<br />\naccepts the existence of three<br />\npagan goddesses in order to further his own religion. This<br />\nblatently contradicts the primary<br />\nmessage of the religion\u2014that there<br />\nis only one God, Allah\u2014and his<br /><br />\n\"Why would the<br />\nMuslim communities of<br />\nthe world find<br />\nRushdie's depictions of<br />\nMuhammad so<br />\noffensive?\"<br />\nfollowers are shocked. So he<br />\ncomes back, says that Gabriel<br />\n(Gibreel in the book) has come to<br />\nhim once again in a dream, and<br />\ntold Muhammad to retract those<br />\nverses in which he accepts the<br />\nthree goddesses, that these verses<br />\ncame from Satan.<br />\nEven after this retraction, there<br />\nis the lingering suspicion in the<br />\nminds of the followers that the<br />\nsatanic verses were not inspired<br />\nat all by the devil, but were actually Muhammad's own words,<br />\nto which he ascribes first to<br />\nGabriel; and later, when his<br />\nfollowers start questioning him,<br />\nto the devil.

More importantly, the<br />\nJays held Syracuse scoreless for<br />\n18:08 at the start of the second<br />\nhalf with a ball control offense.<br />\nThe key to that offense was senior<br />\ncaptain Brendan Kelly.<br />\nThose people who came to the<br />\ngame touting Gary Gait as the nation's top midfielder left talking<br />\nabout Kelly. He quarterbacked<br />\nthe Hopkins attack to perfection,<br />\n\u2022 scoring two goals and setting up<br />\nmany others with some dazzling<br />\nstick handling. Indeed, the senior<br />\nfrom Towson earned his right to<br />\nbe mentioned as one of the nation's top players.<br />\n\"Brendan played the best game<br />\nof his career,\" commented<br />\nHopkins Coach Don Zimmerman. He took complete charge<br />\nof the game.\"<br />\nBut early in the game, it was<br />\nthe Orangemen who took control<br />\nof the game with their fast-break<br />\noffense. Syracuse jumped out to<br />\na 3-1 lead, paced by a goal and<br />\ntwo assists from All-American<br />\nJohn Zulberti. Matt Panetta, a<br />\nsophomore from Elmont, NY,<br />\ntied the game with two<br />\nunanswered goals midway<br />\nthrough the first quarter. For the<br />\nrest of the first half, the two teams<br /><br />\ntraded goals in an explosive, seesaw battle.<br />\nThough the Jays trailed only<br />\n9-8 at the half, they had let the<br />\nOrangemen control the pace of<br />\nthe game. Realizing that they<br />\ncould not run with Syracuse for<br />\nsixty minutes, Hopkins began to<br />\nexecute their ball-control offense<br />\nin the second half. With the pace<br />\nof the game slowed down, Quint<br />\nKessenich and the rest of the<br />\ndefense were able to take control,<br />\nas they blanked the \"unstoppable\" Orangemen for the entire<br />\nthird quarter. Before Syracuse<br />\nwas finally able to get back on the<br />\nscoreboard three minutes into the<br />\nfourth quarter, Hopkins had<br />\nscored four unanswered goals to<br />\ntake a 12-9 lead.<br />\nThe Orangemen came back<br />\nearly in the fourth quarter on<br />\ngoals by Phil Schulter and AllAmerican Gren Burns to again<br />\nmake it a one goal game. Adam<br />\nWright, however, quickly put the<br />\nJays back in control, as he netted<br />\nhis third goal of the game with<br />\njust over seven minutes remaining. Three minutes later, Matt<br />\nPanetta left Syracuse goalie Matt<br />\nPalumb on the ground at the endline and put his fourth goal of the<br />\ngame into an empty net to give<br />\nHopkins a 14-11 lead.<br />\nBut the Gait brothers refused to<br />\ngo down without a struggle.

For the<br />\nmen, it was a tie for the most wins<br />\nin Hopkins history (17), the MAC<br />\nSoutheastern Division Championship, and a fifth place ranking in<br />\nthe Middle Athletic region (one<br />\nspot shy of being invited to the<br />\nnational tournament). However,<br />\nit has not always been this way.<br />\nThree years ago, when coaches<br />\nBill Nelson and Nancy Blank arrived at Hopkins, the basketball<br />\nprograms were looking for focus<br />\nand direction. There was virtually no effort made to recruit and<br />\nbring in substantial scholar<br />\nathletes and create a winning atmosphere at Hopkins. Nelson and<br />\nBlank were hired in June of 1986<br />\nto do just that.<br />\nRobert Scott, Director of<br />\nAthletics at Hopkins, described<br />\ncoaches Nelson and Blank as<br />\n\"proven coaches with proven<br />\nrecords.\" That they certainly are.<br />\nIn 1986, Nelson came to Hopkins<br />\nhaving spent three years at<br />\nNazareth College in Rochester<br />\nand three years at Rochester Institute of Technology. He has<br />\nbeen honored as Coach of the<br />\nYear by the Independent Collegiate Athletic Conference and<br />\nthe New York State Basketball<br />\nCoaches Association, and has<br />\nreached the NCAA Division III<br />\nTournament twice. At R.I.T., he<br />\ntransformed a very lackluster<br /><br />\nprogram into a conference champion in three years. Sound<br />\nfamiliar? His final year at<br />\nNazareth, he finished second in<br />\nthe New York State Coaches Poll<br />\nand seventh in the Final NCAA<br />\nDivision III poll.<br />\nBlank also came to Hopkins<br />\nafter guiding Messiah College to<br />\nthe W.C.I.A. Championship in<br />\n1978 and 1980 and the NCAA<br />\nDistrict II Championship in 1982<br />\nand 1983.<br />\nThe main reason, however,<br />\nthat Nelson and Blank have been<br />\nable to achieve such tremendous<br />\nsuccess, besides their ability to<br />\ncoach the sport well, is their ability to recruit excellent scholarathletes. According to Jerome<br />\nSchnydman, Director of<br />\nUndergraduate Admissions,<br />\n\"There are two reasons why<br />\ncoaches are successful. One,<br />\nbecause they can coach the sport.<br />\nThe second is because they are<br />\ngood recruiters, which is one of<br />\nthe reasons why they have had the<br />\nability to be good coaches. From<br />\nthe start, they have been successful in identifying studentathletes who might be interested<br />\nin Hopkins. When I ask them<br />\nabout the people they recruit,<br />\n...they know all about them,<br />\nacademically and athletically. . .The proof is in the pudding,<br />\nthey are doing well in school and<br />\non the court. What they have said<br />\nhas proven true, they have done<br />\nthe job recruiting good students<br />\nwho are good athletes.\"<br />\nEven though Hopkins has committed itself to improving its<br /><br />\nbasketball programs, it has not<br />\nbeen forced to compromise admissions standards to do so. In<br />\nfact, the story is quite the opposite. According to Nelson, his<br />\nbasketball team is a composite of<br />\nnot only both social and physical<br />\nscience majors, but claims a<br />\nformer high school valedictorian<br />\nand a Beneficial Hodson Scholar.<br />\nAccording to Blank, recruiting<br />\nhas been extremely instrumental<br />\nto her teams success. In her attempts to recruit a freshman<br />\nclass, she, like Nelson, visits<br />\nplayers throughout the year, visits<br />\nbasketball camps during the summer, and uses a recruiting<br />\nstatistical service (called Metro<br />\nIndex) to sort through the endless<br />\nlist of potential prospects. Also<br />\nthrough her network of contacts,<br />\nshe will try to get a feel for those<br />\nscholar-athletes who might be interested in playing Division III<br />\nbasketball at a school like<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe first step for Blank is to go<br />\nthrough her list of potential prospects and sort out those whom<br />\nshe feels are academically<br />\nqualified because, according to<br />\nher, \"there is no use wasting your<br />\ntime on a kid who can't get in the<br />\nfront door.\" Then she starts contacting prospects and keeps contacting them until she feels they<br />\nmay no longer have an interest in<br />\nattending the school. Once she<br />\nhas narrowed this list down further, she goes and sees potential<br />\nprospects play several times or<br />\nwatches videotapes of games. In<br />\nthis process, she tries not to limit<br /><br />\nherself to merely the northeast<br />\nand covers as much of the country as possible. Once she has seen<br />\nher recruits, she, like Nelson and<br />\nother coaches, drafts a ranked list<br />\nof her recruited applicants and<br />\nthen waits and hopes they are<br />\nadmitted.<br />\nFor Nelson, the process is<br />\nmuch the same. Also relying on<br />\nsources such as Metro Index,<br />\nvisiting summer camps, personal<br />\ncontacts, and responding to student inquiries, Nelson sends out<br />\nover 200 questionairres contacting prospective student-athletes.<br />\n'About one quarter of those return<br />\nthe questionairre, and an additional quarter choose to apply. Of<br />\nthose dozen players, Nelson tries<br />\nto watch as many as possible<br />\nplay. Of the rest, he and his staff<br />\nreview videotapes which the<br />\nplayers send. According to<br />\nNelson, he will have seen next<br />\nyear's top recruit play six times<br />\nthis year.<br />\nNelson does not mass recruit,<br />\nhowever, but rather selectively<br />\nattempts to fill specific needs in<br />\nhis line-up. According to Nelson,<br />\nthe year before he arrived, eight<br />\nseniors graduated, leaving him<br />\nwith only one returning starter his<br />\nfirst year, who was also a senior<br />\nand the team's leading scorer.In<br />\nsearch of a point guard, Nelson<br />\nrecruited Dave Eikenberg and<br />\nDave Strong, and needing a<br />\nscorer, found Andy Enfield, who<br />\nis currently on track to be<br />\nHopkins all-time leading scorer.<br />\nThis year, to back up seniors<br />\nMike Latimore and Jedan<br /><br />\nFirst Quarter: 2:39-Syracuse: Zulberti<br />\nfrom Burns; 3:38-Syracuse: Marachek<br />\nfrom Zulberti; 3:54-Hopkins: Rzempoluch<br />\nunassisted; 4:52-Syracuse: Scaramuzzino<br />\nfrom Zulberti; 6:47-Hopkins: Panetta<br />\nunassisted; 7:54-Hopkins: Panetta<br />\nunassisted; 9:30-Syracuse: Hall<br />\nunassisted; 10:52-Hopkins: Wilkens<br />\nunassisted; 11:41-Syracuse: G.
