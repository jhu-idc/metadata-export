This year's<br />\nactivities were criticized from every point of view. Those opposing all such evidences of class spirit were certainly not pleased,<br />\nwhile the group that favors such hostilities was disappointed because of the lack of action. Since the ruling forbidding the breaking up of banquets was passed, only complaints have been registered. This situation has become worse each year, only to reach<br />\nits lowest ebb this week.<br />\nFor those who respect the old customs, everything went wrong.<br />\nFights were apparently held, not for kidnaping, but merely for<br />\nthe sake of fighting. Rules were broken in that hostilities were<br />\ncontinued after the deadline of 6 o'clock. Both classes seemed to<br />\nbe at fault here. Furthermore, only a very small group from each<br />\nclass took part in the action. Not one man, to our knowledge,<br />\nwas kept from attending his banquet. Only one was late in arriving. The point of the fighting, if there is any point at all, is<br />\nto prevent the members of the two classes from attending their<br />\nrespective banquets. During the last two years all efforts along<br />\nthis line have been complete failures.<br />\nFrom what is probably a more sensible point of view, the only<br />\nresults have been many minor injuries, one of a more serious nature,<br />\nand a considerable amount of ruined clothing.<br />\nIt would seem apparent that there are only two ways of solving<br />\nthe problem. Either repeal the ruling forbidding the breaking<br />\nup of banquets or abolish all hostilities. The former is not advisable. The amount of property destroyed, time wasted and<br />\ninjuries incurred as well as the difficulties met with the civil<br />\nauthorities preclude this action. Therefore we recommend that<br />\nStudent Council pass a ruling forbidding all such hostilities in<br />\nthe future.<br />\n<br />\nLACROSSE<br />\nthe Hopkins schedule for the 1930 lacrosse season<br />\nW HEN<br />\nwas announced, many sports followers at the University<br />\nwere dismayed. It appeared that it would be impossible for a<br />\ncomparatively green Hopkins twelve to make any kind of a showing against such a formidable array of opponents.<br />\nTo date this team has made a brilliant showing, defeating<br />\nevery college opponent, and losing only to Mt. Washington,<br />\nprobably the strongest team in the country. Furthermore this<br />\nyear's twelve has shown that it has the power to go through the<br />\nremainder of its schedule without a defeat. This will, of course,<br />\nbe a difficult feat to accomplish. Three of the best college team's<br />\nin the country are yet to be met. The lacrosse team deserves the<br />\nsupport of every undergraduate. A team that is convinced it<br />\ncan't be beaten, will not be beaten. A victory in tomorrow's game<br />\nagainst Princeton will be an immeasurable help in firmly establishing this spirit among the members of the team. A defeat<br />\nmay be disastrous.<br />\nThe success of the 1930 Jay twelve is due primarily to hard<br />\nwork and teamwork. Every man is in danger of losing his position if he falters. No one individual stands out as the star of<br />\nthe team. A team of this type is the hardest kind of a combination to defeat.

The cause of the rioting appears to be, from a dispatch to the<br />\nSun, the dissatisfaction of the student body towards the monarchial<br />\nregime, and avowed interest in a republican government. In order to<br />\nprevent further bloodshed, General<br />\nBerenguer declared that stern measures will have to be adopted towards<br />\nstudent rioting. \"We have to stop<br />\nthis,\" he asserted; \"we have no other remedy\u2014we are taking the necessary measures.\"<br />\n* * *<br />\n<br />\nThe interest aroused during the<br />\nbanquet season is reaching greater<br />\nheights at other colleges than class<br />\nenthusiasim at Hopkins which is<br />\nmanifested in a few half-hearted<br />\nsallies (with most of those who<br />\nshould take part in the combat assuming the duties of half-hearted<br />\nspectators) the only results of which<br />\nare a few dirty trousers, an occasional R. 0. T. C. coat ripped up<br />\nthe middle of the back and perhaps<br />\na not too wary freshman handcuffed to an electric light pole or a sophomore taken for an overlong auto<br />\nride. The struggle between the lower classes at Lafayette, which was<br />\nscheduled to begin at I. was precipitated by the average underclassmen,<br />\nso that several private engagements<br />\nwere well under way at 12:30. The<br />\nR. 0. T. C. companies of the university were engaged in drill until<br />\n2:45, and many members of the unit<br />\nwere seen to cast longing eyes at the<br />\nscene of mortal combat, in which<br />\nthey took part after drill and a<br />\nchange from uniform to classstruggle \"armor.\" At the close of<br />\nthe battle, when the last sounds of<br />\nconflict had died away from the<br />\ncampus, the second-year men were<br />\ndeclared victorious, by virtue of<br />\nhaving secured eight more captives<br />\nthan the yearlings. Despite their defeat of the afternoon, the frosh<br />\nshowed great activity at their banquet, which approximately 150 attended.<br />\n* * *<br />\n<br />\nUpholding the other side of the<br />\nquestion of inter-class fighting, we<br />\nfind a vigorous exponent in the<br />\nTargum of Rutgers University. According to a survey made by the<br />\nRutgers' committee of twelve, underclass warfare in American colleges and universities is a dead institution (or rather almost dead). The<br />\n\"hectic days of the past decade when<br />\nsophomores pummeled freshmen\"<br />\nare gone. A questionnaire was distributed by the Rutgers committee<br />\non class warfare among the deans<br />\nof 18 colleges, including Harvard,<br />\nPrinceton, Yale, Pennsylvania, and<br />\nothers. Nine of the colleges have no<br />\nclass warfare, and nine have freshmen and sophomore engagements in<br />\nmilder forms, while one clean maintained that \"undergraduate warfare<br />\nis valuable to student life and college warfare\" and that he would<br />\n\"hate to see it abolished.\" The lack<br />\nof interest of the students in such<br />\nfunctions is cited as the reason for<br />\nthe increasing sentiment towards the<br />\nabolition of interclass struggles.<br />\n\"'No sudden or sweeping reform<br />\nwill be attempted here.'

This year's<br />\nactivities were criticized from every point of view. Those opposing all such evidences of class spirit were certainly not pleased,<br />\nwhile the group that favors such hostilities was disappointed because of the lack of action. Since the ruling forbidding the breaking up of banquets was passed, only complaints have been registered.

Rules were broken in that hostilities were<br />\ncontinued after the deadline of 6 o'clock. Both classes seemed to<br />\nbe at fault here. Furthermore, only a very small group from each<br />\nclass took part in the action. Not one man, to our knowledge,<br />\nwas kept from attending his banquet. Only one was late in arriving. The point of the fighting, if there is any point at all, is<br />\nto prevent the members of the two classes from attending their<br />\nrespective banquets. During the last two years all efforts along<br />\nthis line have been complete failures.<br />\nFrom what is probably a more sensible point of view, the only<br />\nresults have been many minor injuries, one of a more serious nature,<br />\nand a considerable amount of ruined clothing.<br />\nIt would seem apparent that there are only two ways of solving<br />\nthe problem. Either repeal the ruling forbidding the breaking<br />\nup of banquets or abolish all hostilities. The former is not advisable. The amount of property destroyed, time wasted and<br />\ninjuries incurred as well as the difficulties met with the civil<br />\nauthorities preclude this action.

The cause of the rioting appears to be, from a dispatch to the<br />\nSun, the dissatisfaction of the student body towards the monarchial<br />\nregime, and avowed interest in a republican government. In order to<br />\nprevent further bloodshed, General<br />\nBerenguer declared that stern measures will have to be adopted towards<br />\nstudent rioting. \"We have to stop<br />\nthis,\" he asserted; \"we have no other remedy\u2014we are taking the necessary measures.\"<br />\n* * *<br /><br />\nThe interest aroused during the<br />\nbanquet season is reaching greater<br />\nheights at other colleges than class<br />\nenthusiasim at Hopkins which is<br />\nmanifested in a few half-hearted<br />\nsallies (with most of those who<br />\nshould take part in the combat assuming the duties of half-hearted<br />\nspectators) the only results of which<br />\nare a few dirty trousers, an occasional R. 0.

The<br />\nR. 0. T.

According to a survey made by the<br />\nRutgers' committee of twelve, underclass warfare in American colleges and universities is a dead institution (or rather almost dead). The<br />\n\"hectic days of the past decade when<br />\nsophomores pummeled freshmen\"<br />\nare gone. A questionnaire was distributed by the Rutgers committee<br />\non class warfare among the deans<br />\nof 18 colleges, including Harvard,<br />\nPrinceton, Yale, Pennsylvania, and<br />\nothers. Nine of the colleges have no<br />\nclass warfare, and nine have freshmen and sophomore engagements in<br />\nmilder forms, while one clean maintained that \"undergraduate warfare<br />\nis valuable to student life and college warfare\" and that he would<br />\n\"hate to see it abolished.\" The lack<br />\nof interest of the students in such<br />\nfunctions is cited as the reason for<br />\nthe increasing sentiment towards the<br />\nabolition of interclass struggles.<br />\n\"'No sudden or sweeping reform<br />\nwill be attempted here.'
