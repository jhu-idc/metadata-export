Dr.<br />\nAmes, who is President Emeritus of<br />\nJohns Hopkins Univerity, is chairman of the National Committee for<br />\nAeronautics.<br />\nThe report was made public at the<br />\nsame time that cables from Europe<br />\ntold of suggested cooperation between England, France and Germany<br />\nto compete with Pan-American Airways in transatlantic air service<br />\nwhich is to be inaugurated in the<br />\nnear future. The National Advisory<br />\nCommittee is a Government body, reporting directly to the President of<br />\nthe United States, and is considered<br />\none of the greatest research bodies<br />\nin the country.<br />\n\"There are problems in aviation<br />\nwhich must be solved and solved in<br />\nthe near future,\" said Dr. Ames.<br />\n\"With the governments of Europe<br />\ngiving their attention to such things,<br />\nwe must have more funds for research in this country. We must have<br />\nmore men especially equipped for<br />\nresearch work and more facilities for<br />\nresearch.<br />\n<br />\n\"When within two years the speed<br />\nof airplanes for ordinary transportation is increased from 110 miles<br />\nan hour to 220 miles an hour, it is<br />\nobvious that the developments in<br />\naeronautics occur rapidly.<br />\n\"When I speak of such speed I am<br />\nnot speaking of record speed, of<br />\ncourse, but of speed for ordinary<br />\ntravel. A speed of 300 miles an hour<br />\nis in sight. Some work must be done<br />\nto make it possible. The clippers<br />\nmade in Baltimore at the Glenn Martin plant and serving on the California to Philippine flights make a<br />\nspeed of about 200 miles an hour.\"<br />\n\"A number of universities are doing research work in aeronautics in<br />\naddition to the work which the National Advisory Committee is doing,\"<br />\nDr. Ames said.
