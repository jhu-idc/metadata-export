The first is<br />\ncapitalism; it preaches that every opportunity is here if one only goes<br />\nout and seeks it. The second is consumerism, which insists that<br />\nundergraduate education is the institution's primary objective. Or to<br />\ncombine the two: We're here to enrich you, but it won't be easy.<br />\nSo it's little wonder whenever a budget crisis comes rattling around<br />\nthe corner, administrators and students each have a righteous finger<br />\nto point. You said you were here for us , cry the students, and you<br />\nbroke your promise! The administration, meanwhile, regards the<br />\nstudents as it might a barking dog, and calmly responds, We are here<br />\nfor you. We have always been. But you aren't taking advantage of<br />\nthe excellent opportunities we offer here. Two parties speak, but the<br />\nresult is a pair of monologues\u2014and no progess.<br />\nCaught between all this posturing, meanwhile, and watching it in<br />\nsilence, the University faculty are struggling under a collection of<br />\ngrievances that, if uttered, would make Hamlet's famous soliloquy<br />\non suicide seem trifling by comparison. The faculty cuts, bigger<br />\nenrollments, and tuition hikes that have come to Hopkins in recent<br />\nyears\u2014thus forming the holy trinity of undergraduate complaints\u2014<br />\nare most punishing to the faculty members themselves. It doesn't<br />\ntake advanced calculations to determine the effect of fewer instructors, more students, and a drop in funds for teaching and research<br />\nassistants\u2014first it's fatigue, then impatience, and finally attrition.<br />\nThat attrition, despite what administrators might have you believe,<br />\ndoesn't always appear in the guise of a happy retirement. In recent<br />\nyears Hopkins has lost a disturbing number of excellent teachers and<br />\nscholars, and not to old age. The majority of the French department<br />\nmade its exit last year to Emory University; the Department of<br />\nClassics has seen its members escape to various schools around the<br />\ncountry; and some of the brightest lights in the English department<br />\nwere lured in by Duke several years ago. Taken alone, each of these<br />\nmight seem inconsequential\u2014just another ripple in the everyday affairs of a bustling, prestigious, internationally renowned university.<br />\nBut many faculty members suggest otherwise. In preparing its twopart article on the reshuffling of numbers within the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences\u2014the worst casualty of the financial crisis\u2014the NewsLetter encountered several active faculty members who were nothing<br />\nshort of disgusted with the way the University had treated them.<br />\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, many said that they didn't think<br />\nit likely that things would improve in the future. Several cited the<br />\nlack of funds for research and teaching assistants\u2014this despite increasing class sizes\u2014in a climate where professors are expected to<br />\npublish as frequently as before while carrying heavier teaching loads.<br />\n<br />\nIn a period of budgetary uncertainty, such comments may be taken<br />\nlightly. But the majority of these remarks came from senior tenured<br />\nprofessors\u2014none of them department chairs\u2014who suggested that<br />\ndiscontent is running at all-time high among Arts and Sciences faculty.<br />\nOne complained that there was no system to reward professors for<br />\n\"good behavior\": those who bore heavy loads of undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate teaching were given no \"handicaps,\"such as summer<br />\nresearch money or T.A. budgets, to compensate them for the time<br />\nthat their less popular collegues spent on research. This, another added, was the rule rather than the exception in a university whose<br />\naverage salaries continue to drop in relation to those at other top<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nAnother bone of contention among professors is the added perks<br />\nthat are showered on new tenured professors\u2014signing bonuses, in<br />\neffect, that award newcomers with a salary, a computer budget, and<br />\nadditional perks that far exceed those of professors with years, even<br />\ndecades, of seniority. It's part of the game of faculty hiring, perhaps,<br />\nbut that game can work in two ways\u2014as the depletion of Classics,<br />\nEnglish, and French have shown. Although senior faculty see the<br />\nneed to seduce new candidates, many suggest that Hopkins should<br />\nmake similar overtures to current faculty as well, if only as insurance<br />\nagainst additional departures. Said one professor: \"The University<br />\ncould buy a lot of [dissatisfied] people pretty cheaply.\"<br />\nBut now \"the financial bathtub is full,\" as another professor phrased<br />\nit, and such changes aren't likely to occur soon. But money is by<br />\nno means the only source of faculty discontent. When asked what<br />\nthe University might do to improve faculty morale, one professor<br />\nreplied, \"Listen to us, for one thing.\" Many complicated questions<br />\nhave arisen from the recent evaluation of Arts & Sciences<br />\ndepartments\u2014what the University's academic priorities are, how it<br />\ndetermines them, and if the Hopkins professoriate will ever have a<br />\nvoice in the process. These are\u2014as an administrator might reply\u2014<br />\ninteresting questions, and they deserve thoughtful, cogent, and prompt<br />\nanswers.<br />\nThey also deserve the support of students, who should realize that<br />\nthe problems they perceive with the University now are nothing compared to what additional faculty losses might bring. One hopes that,<br />\nas Armstrong and Richardson juggle the dozens of interests that their<br />\njobs comprise, they remember that consumer and capitalist are foiled alike if there is no product to offer. Chances are good that they<br />\nknow the answer to the question posed by the headline. It will be<br />\na test of their commitment to Arts and Sciences to see if they can<br />\neventually answer it, honestly, with \"no one.\"<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nQuestioning an Ancient Greek Ritual; Sexist Critic?<br />\n<br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nDouglass Barre<br />\n<br />\nEpisode Twelve:<br />\nSignum Registration<br />\nMiranda had set her alarm<br />\nclock for five in the morning.<br />\nNormally, Miranda considered<br />\nfive in the morning a place on par<br />\nwith the fourth circle of hell, but<br />\nthis was one of those occasions<br />\nwhen Miranda's academic duty<br />\ncalled for effort above and<br />\nbeyond its normal demands.<br />\nJanuary registration was one of<br />\nthem. Not everybody got up at<br />\nfive in the morning for January<br />\nregistration, but not everybody<br />\nwas trying to get into Professor<br />\nMulvilhill's expanded psychology<br />\nseminar on pop culture as the incarnation of the collective<br />\nsubconscious.<br />\nMiranda noticed, as she<br />\nslammed the alarm clock into the<br />\nplastic milk crate it sat upon, that<br />\nthe sun had not risen. Miranda's<br />\ntwo rules of thumb explicitly<br />\nstated that when she woke up, the<br />\nsun should be up, and when she<br />\nwent to sleep, it had better be<br />\ndown. Nothing upset Miranda<br />\nmore than looking up from a late<br />\nnight paper to see that the sun had<br />\nbegun to rise. It made it very difficult for her to continue to convince herself that it was still Tuesday night, when Wednesday morning was bouncing off her mirror into her face. The only thing<br />\nworse than that, Miranda<br />\nthought, noting that the night's<br />\nlactic acid buildup had effectively paralyzed her entire body, was<br />\ntrying to tell yourself it was<br />\nWednesday morning when an<br />\naching back, crusty eyes, and a<br />\nfairly active dream life wanted<br />\nyou to believe it was still Tuesday night.<br />\nMiranda had had enough<br />\nforesight to fill out her registration form ahead of time. All she<br />\nneeded were the signatures to<br />\nauthenticate her last semester in<br />\nwas<br />\nshe<br />\nand<br />\nschool<br />\nbureaucratically stable for the rest<br />\nof her scholarly career.<br />\nShe didn't notice what clothes<br />\nshe was putting on. She didn't<br />\ncare what she had to eat. She<br />\n<br />\nhardly even noticed Zack asleep<br />\non the couch, a pink registration<br />\nform blank on the floor next to<br />\nhim. She did notice Doris humming insufferably happily to<br />\nherself dancing around the<br />\nkitchen.<br />\nMiranda wanted to shoot her,<br />\nmore than she ever wanted to<br />\nshoot someone before.<br />\n\"Oh, hi, Miranda! Getting up<br />\nearly for Spring registration?\"<br />\n\"I'm going to kill you, Doris.\"<br />\n\"What classes are you<br />\ntaking?\"<br />\nDoris had come home from<br />\nChristmas vacation, and apparently, on the plane back, had<br />\nmet some president-in-training<br />\n<br />\nMiranda wanted to<br />\nshoot Doris more than<br />\nshe ever wanted to<br />\nshoot someone before<br />\n<br />\npolitical student Adonis named<br />\nChris who she had been seeing<br />\never since. Miranda was happy<br />\nfor her, except for the fact that<br />\nDoris happy and attached was<br />\neven more upbeat and nauseating<br />\nas Doris unhappy and alone. She<br />\nhoped he had a mistress.<br />\n\"I'm up to get into Mulvilhill's<br />\nclass,\" Miranda said, restraining<br />\nherself from throttling Pollyanna.<br />\n\"Well, I'll go on campus with<br />\nyou. Should we wake Zackie?\"<br />\n\"Only if we want him to<br />\nenroll.\"<br />\n\"I'll get him up, then.\" Doris<br />\nbeamed. Miranda momentarily<br />\nwondered if Zack were one of<br />\nthose people who attempted to kill<br />\nthe people that woke them up.<br />\nFrom the thud in the living room,<br />\nhe seemed to be more of the kind<br />\nof person to fall out of bed when<br />\nawakened.<br />\nSomehow Zack, Doris, and<br />\nMiranda made it successfully to<br />\nContinued on page 20<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a student at Hopkins, I am extremely frustrated with this University and its administration. I find it<br />\nincomprehensible after reading the<br />\nDecember 7th issue of the NewsLetter that more is being done to rid<br />\nthe campus of smokers than to<br />\nROTC/nonthe<br />\nresolve<br />\ndiscriminatory policy conflict or to<br />\nsave the social psychology program<br />\nfrom extinction.<br />\nI came to Hopkins with no worries about the credibility of a<br />\nHopkins education. As a double major in French and psychology, I have<br />\nsince changed my mind and am<br />\nseriously considering transferring,<br />\nsomething my freshman naivete<br />\nwould never have allowed me to<br />\nconsider. However, after the massexodus of the French department and<br />\nthe impending extinction of social<br />\npsychology here, I continually ask<br />\nmyself, \"Why am I here?\"<br />\nIt's time for the administration to<br />\nget its priorities straight. In the midst<br />\nof a deteriorating undergraduate<br />\nacademic program and social conflict, all the administration can offer is rhetoric. We need action now,<br />\nbefore the detrimental effects of the<br />\nfive year plan are manifested in some<br />\nother department. What does our<br />\n$15 thousand tuition go toward,<br />\nanyway?<br />\nBut Bradley Cohen, writer of the<br />\nEgo Dico column, makes me feel<br />\nI'm alone in my concerns. In the<br />\nDecember 7th issue of the NewsLetter, Mr. Cohen listed several<br />\nissues which were \"so miniscule as<br />\nto not warrant a list of them.\" These<br />\n\"non-events\" included the creation<br />\nof a women's studies program, the<br />\nMSE symposium on race relations,<br />\nand the ROTC debate, all issues that<br />\nI feel require enormous attention and<br />\nare perhaps the most important<br />\nissues on campus. If Mr. Cohen's<br />\ncallousness is representative of the<br />\nmajority of the student body, I<br />\ndouble question any socially conscious person's role at this university of higher learning.<br />\nDanielle Picher<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nGreek systems nationally are on<br />\nthe chopping block as incubators of<br />\nalcohol abuse, hazing, racism, and<br />\nsexual harassment. I think anyone<br />\nwho has been to a fraternity party<br />\nhere at Hopkins can attest that such<br />\nthings not only exist within our community, but are not hard to find.<br />\nOn December 7th, 1990,1 was invited to Alpha Tau Omega's holiday<br />\ncelebration by, among others, the<br />\nfraternity's president.

It is supposed to be<br />\namusing, but can get quite lewd. I<br />\nwas shocked and upset to be included as one of the subjects of the most<br />\nobscene limerick of the night! The<br />\nremark, however based on an actuality, was a personal affair and no<br />\nbusiness of the affronting parties, let<br />\nalone the rest of the room. The<br />\nSongfest material is prepared ahead<br />\nof time by a committee and is supposed to be checked and/or censored<br />\nby the Executive Board. This time,<br />\nthat procedure was not followed<br />\ncarefully enough. I cannot believe<br />\nthat this could have not been<br />\nprevented!<br />\nHopkins is such a small place; it<br />\nis difficult to avoid the rumors that<br />\ninevitably float around. As a<br />\nwoman, I feel particularly<br />\nvulnerable. There is a huge double<br />\nstandard between what is acceptable<br />\nfor women to do and what is acceptable for men. Understanding that<br />\npeople make mistakes, I went to the<br />\nthree brothers most responsible seeking apologies. One brother said,<br />\n\"No. You weren't even supposed to<br />\nbe there,\" and another stubbornly<br />\nrefused. I informed ATO's President<br />\nof their attitudes and soon they had<br />\nboth been coerced into giving me<br />\n\"sincere\" apologies. The third had<br />\nreadily apologized and accepted<br />\nmuch of the blame for the Songest<br />\nremarks\u2014he said something along<br />\nthe same lines as the night before,<br />\nat the monthly fraternity meeting. He<br />\nfelt that his indiscretion had encouraged the inclusion of that piece<br />\nof information in the next night's<br />\nSongfest lyrics.<br />\nSeveral women who have since<br />\nfound out about the incident have<br />\ntold me that they are offended by the<br />\nway women in general get treated by<br />\nfraternities, and a few could relate<br />\nsimilar personal experiences. I can't<br />\n<br />\nbelieve that this sort of thing goes on<br />\nall the time and no one seems to care<br />\nenough to do anything about it.<br />\nWomen should refuse to be subjected to such discriminatgion. Some<br />\nbrothers do seem genuinely concerned for my feelings, and to their<br />\ncredit, ATO has since sent me<br />\nflowers and made other attempts to<br />\nameliorate the situation.<br />\nThat fraternities can take what<br />\nshould be private and turn it into a<br />\npublic spectacle, especially when it<br />\ninvolves sexual exploits and the objectification of women is infuriating.<br />\nIf ATO could live up to its \"commitment\" (see the Rush book), all<br />\nwomen, including myself, should<br />\ngreatly appreciate it.<br />\nBrooke Gallagher<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:.<br />\nCongratulations to the Hopkins<br />\nTheatre lab and the Goucher Department of Theatre for the fantastic job<br />\nthey did with \"Different Voices,<br />\nDifferent Worlds\" last weekend. All<br />\nof the original one-act plays were<br />\nwell-written, professionally acted,<br />\nand thoroughly enjoyable. To top it<br />\noff, the performance was free of<br />\ncharge. What more could one want?<br />\nI hope that there will be more of<br />\nthese events in the future.<br />\nDan Barrett<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a cast member of \"Throat<br />\nCulture,\" a writer, and a representative of Barnstormers, I would like<br />\nto address what I believe were a few<br />\njudgmental errors in your review of<br />\n\"Throat Culture.\"<br />\nFirst, the review appeared after<br />\nthe final performance. I went to the<br />\nNews-Letter office a week before the<br />\nfirst weekend of the show (which<br />\nran, for the first time since its creation, for two weekends instead of<br />\none) and asked to have the first Fri-<br />\n<br />\nLetters Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editors. Letters<br />\nmust be typed, double spaced, and Include the author's<br />\nname and telephone for<br />\nverification purposes. The<br />\nNews-Letter reserves the<br />\nright to edit for condensation.<br />\nLetters must be delivered to<br />\nthe Gatehouse by Tuesday at<br />\n5 p.m. for inclusion in that<br />\nFriday's paper. Once a letter<br />\nis delivered, it becomes the<br />\n<br />\nproperty of the News-Letter.<br />\nLetters must be no more than<br />\n350 words and signed by at<br />\nleast one person and no more<br />\nthan two persons. Letters<br />\ncredited only to organizations<br />\nwill not be printed. Due to<br />\nthe volume of letters received, not all can be printed. We<br />\nreserve the right to limit the<br />\nnumber of letters printed in<br />\na given issue.<br />\n<br />\nday and/or Saturday reviewed. I did<br />\nthis for two reasons. First, a review<br />\nis the best publicity a performance<br />\ncan have; it would have encouraged<br />\nstudents who missed it the first<br />\nweekend to attend the shows the second weekend. Second, the<br />\ncriticisms of a knowledgable and experienced theater critic can help the<br />\nmembers of an improvisational<br />\ngroup to refine its work. The absense<br />\nof a review after the first weekend<br />\nwas glaring and unprofessional,<br />\nespecially considering that I received a promise from the Editor-inChief that a reviewer would be present. I don't know where the fault<br />\nrests, but this kind of failure should<br />\nnot happen again.<br />\nMy second criticism concerns the<br />\nlanguage and tone of the review,<br />\nwhich I (and a fellow \"Throat<br />\nCulture\" member) believe had sexist implications. Kevin Dorgan and<br />\nErik Bertin, my fellow cast<br />\nmembers, were highlighted (and<br />\nrightly so) as especially talented<br />\ncomics. Later in the review, I was<br />\nreferred to as the most talented of the<br />\nfemale cast members; a comic who<br />\nhad \"no trouble keeping up with the<br />\nfast pace of the show.\" First of all,<br />\nwhy the qualifier? Why are Mr.<br />\nDorgan and Mr. Bertin simply<br />\ntalented cast members, when I am a<br />\nfemale cast member? Does gender<br />\ncreate a difference in the analysis of<br />\ncomedy? If I'm funny, I'm funny,<br />\nregardless of my gender. If I'm not<br />\nas talented as Mr. Dorgan and Mr.<br />\nBertin (and it is a claim I wouldn't<br />\nrefute; they are wonderfully talented<br />\nindividuals who deserve special<br />\nrecognition), then I should not be<br />\nrecognized in a review. If the most<br />\ntalented members of any given cast<br />\nrepresent only one gender, so be it.<br />\nSecondly, it is hardly a positive condition of talent to \"keep up with\"<br />\nthe pace of a performance. I thank<br />\nyou for praising my \"faces and accents,\" but a mere ability to keep up<br />\nhas nothing to do with comic ability. How you determined, moreover,<br />\nthat I was \"keeping up with\" as opposed to, perhaps, setting, or merely working with the pace is beyond<br />\nme. What would one think if, in<br />\nanalyzing Mr. Edelman's review, I<br />\nwere to say, \"Mr. Edelman, a very<br />\ntalented male reporter for the NewsLetter, shows a remarkable ability to<br />\nkeep up with the pace of the English<br />\nlangauge?\"<br />\nI emphasize this contention of sexism because it was and is a constant<br />\nstruggle for women in comedy to<br />\nsecure roles in which their sexuality, or femininity, are not vehicles for<br />\nmen's comedic talents.

The 2001 skit mocking the<br />\nLacrosse players was not designed<br />\nto suggest that primitive man underwent a beautiful evolution to become<br />\nHopkins Lacrosse players. On the<br />\ncontrary, it was not, as you say,<br />\n\"positive,\" but perhaps the most<br />\nsardonic and bitter of the skits<br />\n(which accounts for its success).<br />\n2001 simply suggested that Lacrosse<br />\nplayers are Neanderthals. Harsh as<br />\n<br />\nthis literalism is, the comedy of the<br />\npiece is the truth from which such<br />\na criticism springs, which includes<br />\nthe special academic treatment of not<br />\nnecessarily academically special<br />\nstudents, the ridiculous glorification<br />\nof lacrosse at Hopkins, etc.<br />\nIf we failed to get that message<br />\nacross, then that is one thing.

Andrew Bragen plays Bruno, a<br />\nHolden Caufield character who is<br />\nsick of always being the loser.<br />\nBragen has a few good serious<br />\nmoments, but it's Doug Barre's<br />\nnaive Lenny that carries the piece<br />\nthrough its awkward portions.<br />\nJessica Mathewson's \"The<br />\nParty\" ended up this year's<br />\nTheatre Lab with a quick shot of<br />\nblack humor. Mathewson shows<br />\nus a nuclear family that's so incredibly obnoxious that only<br />\nmurder and mayhem could result,<br />\nand it does. From a technical<br />\naspect, \"The Party\" was the<br />\nsloppiest play of the bunch; some<br />\nof the lines were garbled and the<br />\ntiming was off at times. But this<br />\ncriticism ignores some of the funniest moments of the entire<br />\nTheatre Lab, notably the \"Love<br />\nBoat\" celebration at the tail end<br />\nand the grating bursts of song by<br />\ndaughter Monica (Lucia Bowes).<br />\nOverall, what can be said about<br />\nthe undergraduate play-wrights at<br />\nJohns Hopkins?

Alice Tate (Mia<br />\nFarrow) is a chronically fretful<br />\nNew York housewife, who<br />\nspends her busy days shopping<br />\nand rushing from one mysterious<br />\nsocial appointment to another.<br />\nAlice has a phantom pain in her<br />\nback, but acupuncturist Dr. Yang<br />\n(the late Keye Luke) diagnoses<br />\nproblems of the heart and mind,<br />\nnot the lumbar vertebrea. With<br />\nYang's herbal potions as her<br />\nguide, Alice sheds her inhibitions<br />\nand goes on an adventure, taking<br />\nup with a divorced horn player<br />\n(Joe Mantegna) and battling her<br />\ndisinterested husband (William<br />\nHurt) in an effort to find meaning and purpose in her life. The<br />\ncaper quality seems a stretch for<br />\nAllen; his moments of humor<br />\ndon't usually rely on his main<br />\ncharacters turning invisible, or<br />\nflying, literally, over the Manhattan skyline. But there are several<br />\ntruly wonderful scenes in Alice\u2014<br />\nsome funny, others touching, all<br />\ndirected with the panache of a<br />\ndirector who, unlike so many,<br />\nseems to know what he's doing.<br />\n<br />\nThe ending is a rush job, sensible but far too neat for a film and<br />\ndirector who mocks life's<br />\nneatness at every turn. But<br />\noverall, buoyed by Farrow's<br />\nstrongest performance since Purple Rose of Cairo and first-rate<br />\nproduction qualitites, Alice is certainly worth a look.<br />\nAwakenings - When introverted<br />\nneurologist Malcolm Sayer<br />\n(Robin Williams) stumbles upon<br />\na group of lifeless chronic<br />\nhospital patients in 1969, some<br />\nasleep for decades, he thinks he's<br />\nfound the perfect working environment. That is, until he tests<br />\nan experimental drug on Leonard<br />\nRowe (Robert DeNiro), who<br />\nwakes and begins life again with<br />\nall the wonder of a young boy<br />\ntaking his first, delicate steps.<br />\nSoon the entire ward (known by<br />\nthe orderlies as the garden: \"we<br />\nfeed 'em and we water 'em\") is<br />\non its feet, mostly reveling in<br />\nlife's simpler joys, like a comb<br />\nthrough the hair or feeding<br />\noneself. A miracle? Perhaps, until the wonder drug's heartbreaking side effects kick in. DeNiro's<br />\nprecise acting is almost painful to<br />\nwatch\u2014as a vegetable with a personality suddenly foisted upon<br />\n<br />\nhim, and then almost snatched<br />\naway, he's got little room for er7<br />\nror.

The concept<br />\nof the record is sometimes hazy<br />\nbut generally follows various permutations of the forces of good<br />\nand evil, love and hate through<br />\nthe search of a young man to find<br />\nhimself, faith hope love could<br />\nvery well be a breakthrough<br />\nalbum for this promising band;<br />\nalthough they haven't quite fully<br />\nrealized their concepts, they're<br />\ngetting there.

(Peter<br />\nAsher's crystalline production has<br />\naltered the Maniacs' sound considerably on their last two<br />\nrecords, widening but sometimes<br />\ndehumanizing the songs.)<br />\nStill, the band had a few good<br />\nideas to kick around.

Sitting in a room in the Hotel Splendour, drinking whisky and<br />\nwincing with pain after each<br />\nswig, sits Cesar Castillo, exMambo King, allowing himself to<br />\nbecome a shadow.<br />\nDespite being \"blessed with<br />\ntremendous energy, a surge of<br />\npower from too many slaps in the<br />\nface from his foul-tempered<br />\nfather,\" Cesar is now fat, sick,<br />\ndrunk, tired. Despite this apparant lack of energy, the novel<br />\n<br />\nitself often moves quickly, picking up the beat of the rhumba, the<br />\nmambo, and the cha-cha.<br />\nOn the surface, Mambo Kings<br />\nis the story oftwo brothers born<br />\nin a small town in Oriente Province, Cuba who, despite their<br />\ndifferences of character, bond<br />\ntogether through their music.<br />\nBeginning in lively Havana, they<br />\nmove on to New York and their<br />\npeak ofpopularity by appearing<br />\non ILove Lucy. The death of their<br />\nyounger brother Nestor,<br />\nhowever,jars Cesar so much that<br />\nhe is unable to compose and<br />\nbegins instead to look back on his<br />\nlife.<br />\nIn a way, Cesar becomes the<br />\nstereotypical macho latino who<br />\nknows how to get women to<br />\nplease him sexually, while Nestor<br />\nis quiet, introverted and broken<br />\nhearted. As the author himself<br />\nsays, \"Cesar was un macho<br />\ngrande; Nestor, un infeliz.\"<br />\n<br />\nBut one cannot summarize the<br />\nbook so quickly. The characters<br />\nare torn away from stereotype by<br />\nthe details and description of<br />\nNestor's love affair with Maria,<br />\nof how she makes him feel<br />\n\"alive, cono!\" or of Cesar's<br />\nregrets about his marriage.<br />\nWe find out that shy, \"saintly\" Nestor is capable of incredible sexual activity while macho,<br />\ndevil-may-care Cesar is capable<br />\nof loving a woman enough to<br />\nmarry her. Unfortunately, Maria<br />\nabandons Nestor leaving him to<br />\ncheat on his wife and ask himself<br />\nwhat he is doing with his youth.<br />\nThe book then is not just about<br />\ntwo gallegos; or arrogant<br />\nCubans. Simply because these<br />\ntwo men are brothers, they are<br />\ncapable of caring deeply about<br />\neach other as well as for the rest<br />\nof their \"family.\"<br />\nDespite the macho attitude of<br />\nthe novel, especially of its cen-<br />\n<br />\nAn Excerpt from<br />\nThe Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love<br />\nLooking at her, Nestor felt faint-hearted: she was<br />\nmore beautiful than the sea, than the morning light,<br />\nthan a wildflower field, and her whole body, agitated<br />\nand sweaty from her struggles, gave off an aromatic<br />\nfemale scent, somewhere between meat and perfume<br />\nand ocean air, that assailed Nestor's nostrils, sank<br />\ndown into his body like mercury, and twisted in his<br />\ngut like Cupid's naughty arrow.

Weir,<br />\nwho wrote and directed, brings a<br />\ncertain grace and charm to an<br />\notherwise grimy New York, and<br />\nplaces the characters in enough<br />\ninteresting situations to make it<br />\nwork. It's a flimsy premise\u2014<br />\nhardly helped by McDowell's<br />\ntoothy smile and L'oreal brand of<br />\nfrigid acting\u2014but Depardieu<br />\nshows why he's considered the<br />\ngreatest actor in France today.

The next step will be to<br />\nremove Hussein from power to<br />\nprevent him from any further ag-<br />\n<br />\ngressive acts, and she believes<br />\nthis will lead to a period of<br />\nAmerican and allied occupation<br />\nin Iraq. Though Hamedani fears<br />\nthat a bloody land war in the Middle East may be unavoidable, she<br />\nstill hopes that the crisis can be<br />\nresolved through diplomacy<br />\nrather than through further<br />\nmilitary action.<br />\nKathy Mansour, a student from<br />\nEgypt, expressed her fear that the<br />\nresolution of the crisis would take<br />\na larger toll than originally anticipated. Egypt is supporting the<br />\ncoalition's efforts with ground<br />\ntroops, and Mansour agrees with<br />\nthat effort, although she said a<br />\nlarge portion of the Egyptian<br />\npopulation, especially the less<br />\neducated, are indifferent to<br />\nKuwait's cause and do not favor<br />\nthe American-led efforts to<br />\nliberate the nation. Mansour, a<br />\nCoptic Egyption, believes that the<br />\nmilitary effort is \"unfortunate but<br />\nnecessary.\" She hopes that<br />\ndiplomatic efforts will continue<br />\nand that Iraq will come to a<br />\npeaceful resolution with both<br />\nKuwait and Israel.<br />\nMichelle Levy, a student<br />\nwhose family came from Egypt<br />\nand settled in the United States<br />\nand Israel, said she was proud of<br />\nthe Israelis for not retaliating<br />\nagainst Iraq's numerous missle<br />\nattacks on Tel Aviv\u2014an action<br />\nthat has already cost the lives of<br />\nat least four Israelis. Levy has<br />\nbeen in contact with her relatives<br />\nin Israel, and says that the Israelis<br />\nare for the most part satisfied with<br />\nthe efforts of the United Statesled alliance to defend them<br />\nagainst Iraq's offensive strategies.<br />\nIsrael is respectful of the<br />\nUnited States' aims to defend<br />\nKuwait, Levy said, but she went<br />\non to express her opinion that the<br />\nU.S. should withdraw as soon as<br />\nit has succeeded in its stated goal<br />\nof defending Kuwait's sovereignty. Levy pointed out that the Arab<br />\nnations have always been<br />\nsuspicious of the West, and that<br />\nIsrael's peaceful relations with the<br />\nU.S. have provoked and will continue to cause hostilities between<br />\nIsrael and other Arab nations after<br />\n<br />\nthe war between the U.S.-led<br />\nalliance and Iraq is over.<br />\nLevy hopes that the Arabs will<br />\nbe able to settle the conflict in the<br />\nMiddle East on their own, with<br />\nthe United Nations overseeing but<br />\nnot actively engineering the<br />\nresolution of political unrest in the<br />\nPersian Gulf. Hussein's anticipation of a long war is more realistic<br />\nthan the hopes of the United<br />\nStates to end hostilities as quickly as possible, Levy said.<br />\nMaha Damaj, a Lebanese<br />\ncitizen whose parents live in the<br />\nUnited Arab Emirates, said that<br />\nthe Arabs, while out of range of<br />\ncombat and therefore not immediately threatened, fear the effects that the war will have on the<br />\nnation's economy. She feels that<br />\nthe United States generally does<br />\nnot have a right to be fighting in<br />\nthe Middle East. Damaj is comforted by the fact that the United<br />\nStates is aiding in the battle to<br />\nstop Hussein, but she feals that<br />\nmuch more should have been<br />\ndone to find a peaceful solution.<br />\nAnother student from Lebanon,<br />\nwhose parents now work in Saudi<br />\nArabia, also said that he was<br />\ngrateful for the help of the United<br />\nStates and the coalition. Many<br />\nSaudis, however, are against the<br />\nwar and feel that Iraq would not<br />\nhave attacked if they hadn't been<br />\nprovoked by the tremendous<br />\nbuildup of the United States,<br />\nwhich began in August with the<br />\nimplementation of Desert Shield.<br />\nKing Fahd will support the actions of the United States-led<br />\nalliance even though the Saudi<br />\nArabian people are generally<br />\nagainst war.<br />\nWhile Arab-Americans view<br />\nthe current military action of the<br />\ncoalition against Hussein as hasty, they feel that action against<br />\nHussein was necessary. As<br />\nseveral have pointed out, Bush's<br />\ntactics may stop Hussein but the<br />\ntactics do not take into account<br />\nthe turmoil of conflicting loyalties<br />\namong nations in the Middle<br />\nEast, or the long-term success of<br />\nthe aggressive foreign policy of<br />\nthe U.S. in the Middle East.<br />\n<br />\n\f16/FEBRUARY 1, 1990<br />\n<br />\nSpnin 1991<br />\n0.1IP<br />\n<br />\nThe events in the Faculty/Student Interaction Program are offered free of charge<br />\nfor undergraduates through funding by the Young Alumni Fund and the<br />\nHomewood Deans.

After a<br />\nrocky 3-4 start, the Blue Jays<br />\nhave racked up ten wins in their<br />\nlast twelve games, including victories over league foes Swarthmore and Ursinus last week,<br />\nraising their chances for post<br />\nseason play from nonexistent to<br />\nlikely. The Jays are also sitting<br />\natop the MAC Southeast division<br />\nwith a perfect 6-0 mark.<br />\nSwarthmore came to Baltimore<br />\nlast Saturday sporting a 3-0<br />\nrecord in the division, but the<br />\nJays defended their nest with an<br />\n82-77 wind to assume sole<br />\npossession of first place. Andy<br />\nEinfield, as usual, led the way<br />\nwith 31 points, hitting 11 of 15<br />\nshots including four three<br />\npointers. Enfield had a quiet first<br />\nhalf, scoring just seven points,<br />\nbut the rest of the team hit their<br />\nshots to help Hopkins to a 39-11<br />\nlead at the half. At halftime, the<br />\nGarnets apparently decided that<br />\nin order to win, they would have_ \u2022<br />\n<br />\nto tighten up their defense on the<br />\nentire Hopkins lineup rather than<br />\nconcentrating on Enfield, then<br />\nhope that the All-American guard<br />\nwould not have his usual touch.<br />\nHe did, however, exploding for<br />\n24 second half points.<br />\nThe Jays defense played well,<br />\nholding the Garnets to 45.6 percent shooting, but were helped<br />\nout by Swarthmore's curious<br />\nstrategy on offense. Despite the<br />\nfact that their burly center, Robert<br />\nRuffin, appeared to be having his<br />\nway with Hopkins' inside<br />\nplayers, Swarthmore's guards<br />\nand forwards continued to fire up<br />\noutside shots. Ruffin finished<br />\nwith twelve points on 6-10<br />\nshooting, while four of his teammates took more shots than he<br />\ndid.<br />\nFour nights later, the Jays gave<br />\na rude welcome to the Ursinus<br />\nBears, who went back to their den<br />\nwith a 70-62 beating.

In a very lopsided<br />\ncompetition, Franklin and Marshall won easily, eight matches to<br />\none.<br />\nCoach Frank Cushman did not<br />\nfeel that the loss was indicative<br />\nof Hopkins' performance. He explained, \"Franklin and Marshall<br />\nis a division one team and was<br />\nranked fifth in the country last<br />\nyear.<br />\n\"For comparison, Hopkins<br />\nwas ranked twenty-fourth out of<br />\ntwenty-six teams. This match was<br />\ncomparable to our football team<br />\nplaying Michigan. It shouldn't<br />\neven occur.\"<br />\nThe Franklin and Marshall<br />\ncoach, Patty Epps, predicted her<br />\nteam's easy win and pulled her<br />\none, three, and four position<br />\nplayers from the match for the<br />\nsecond year in a row. She did<br />\ncompliment Coach Cushman on<br />\nthe team's improvement from last<br />\nyear.<br />\nCushman continued, \"They<br />\npulled people out last year, too.<br />\nBut last year we barely won a<br />\ngame. This year we won several<br />\ngames and almost won a couple<br />\nof matches.\"<br />\nThis match brings the team's<br />\nrecord to five wins and three<br />\nlosses. Cushman is happy with<br />\nthe record and feels, \"We've<br />\nbeaten every team we expected to<br />\nbeat and have only lost to teams<br />\nthat are significantly better than<br />\nwe are.\"<br />\nIn the individual matches, Karran Phillips and Tara Dorr played<br />\nagainst the top Franklin and Mar-<br />\n<br />\nshall participants and lost in three<br />\nmatches.<br />\nNatasha Dupont, in the number<br />\nthree position, and Kathy Herring, in the number nine position,<br />\nbarely lost to their opponents.<br />\nDupont won her first two games<br />\nand Herring's match wasn't<br />\ndecided until the final point. This<br />\nwas Herring's first time playing<br />\nin a scored position.<br />\nJessica Tropp and Christina<br />\nvon Reisenfelder both also<br />\nmanaged to take one game from<br />\ntheir opponents.

Cushman commented,<br />\n\"We'll miss Rosy, but we're glad<br />\nto see Michelle again. It just so<br />\nhappens that they play at about<br />\nthe same skill level so we didn't<br />\nhave to reshuffle the line-up.\"<br />\nIn the number eight position,<br />\nJill Litt easily beat her opponent<br />\nin three games. She commented,<br />\n\"It was intimidating playing a<br />\ndivision one team, but once I<br />\nstarted playing I realized that she<br />\nwasn't any better than I am.\"<br />\nThe team is looking forward to<br />\nthe Howe Cup to finish their<br />\nseason. Cushman is unsure<br />\nwhether Hopkins will play against<br />\ndivision three or four competition<br />\nyet. To prepare for the season<br />\nchampionship the team has been<br />\ndoing sprint drills.

In reality the thirteen week<br />\ncampaign was a respite from the<br />\nrigors of recruiting future football<br />\nplayers.<br />\n\"Recruiting is the most important part of any football program,\" said Margraff. \"Players<br />\nwin football games, X's and O's<br />\ndo not really have a lot of do with<br />\nit.\"<br />\nFollowing the Blue Jays final<br />\ngame against Western Maryland,<br />\nMargraff and defensive coordinator Bob Benson embarked<br />\non an ambitious pilgrimmage up<br />\nand down the North-East corridor<br />\nin search of the sometimes elusive<br />\nstudent-athlete.<br />\n\"Right after the season, Coach<br />\nBenson and I took off for five<br />\nweeks,\" said Margraff. \"Coach<br />\nBenson went to New Jersey and<br />\nPhiladelphia, while I went to<br />\nMaryland, Virginia and New<br />\nYork. Coach Bob Babb basically handles everything here in the<br />\noffice, since he's also the baseball<br />\ncoach, and he basically recruits<br />\nPennsylvania by phone, which is<br />\nour most represented state. We<br />\ndo that up to the holiday season<br />\nand then we make visits from<br />\nJanuary through early March.\"<br />\nWhile Coach Margraff did not<br />\nreveal the names of players he<br />\n<br />\nwas recruiting (since admissions<br />\nresults are not given until April),<br />\nit was clear that Hopkins was<br />\nbecoming a point of interest,<br />\nrather than a point of departure.<br />\n\"At first many people didn't<br />\neven know Hopkins played football, although that has stopped<br />\nsince we've been out on the<br />\nroad,\" said Margraff. \"People<br />\nknow we're a great academic<br />\nschool and after our victories<br />\nagainst well-known programs like<br />\nGettysburg and Franklin and<br />\nMarshall, we have received<br />\ngreater interest.\"<br />\nThe first step in recruiting for<br />\nMargraff is to make sure the<br />\ncandidate is in the so-called<br />\n\"academic ballpark.\" Once that<br />\nis done, the coaching staff relies<br />\non video and high speed information systems, to evaluate players<br />\nfrom T.V. monitors and in the<br />\ncomfort of their own office.<br />\nMargraff pointed out, \"High<br />\nschools are just like us in that they<br />\nfilm all their games. We compile<br />\na list of who we like and then we<br />\ntry to recruit them, and hope they<br />\nget in. Ultimately, the decision<br />\nrests with Admissions.<br />\n\"Hopkins is a great academic<br />\nschool in a great area and the difference between us and Penn is<br />\nthat if you can play in your junior<br />\nand senior year there, you could<br />\nmaybe start three years here.\"<br />\nThe end result has been a<br />\ndramatic increase in football applicants to Hopkins, and the<br />\npossible transfer of players from<br />\nhigh-profile programs.<br />\n<br />\nby Jay Friedman<br />\nIn their first game following the<br />\nwinter break, the Hopkins<br />\nHockey Team traveled to<br />\nWashington for a rematch with<br />\nGeorgetown. Hopkins blew away<br />\nthe Hoyas in their first meeting<br />\nat the Baltimore Arena but were<br />\nnot as lucky this time. While the<br />\nJays did manage to gain a point<br />\nin a 4-4 tie it was a mildly disappointing game. Although the<br />\nsquad was short players, without<br />\na coach for the contest and had<br />\nnot played together in over six<br />\nweeks, they played well enough<br />\nfor a tie, keeping their record<br />\nabove .500 at 5-4-2 on the<br />\nseason.<br />\nSince neither Hopkins nor<br />\nGeorgetown had even practiced<br />\nsince early December, the first<br />\nperiod was a low scoring affair.<br />\n<br />\nDonna Williamson<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins wrestling squad's most recent disappointment,<br />\na 41-3 defeat at the hands of Susquehanna, dropped the team's overall<br />\nrecord to 2-7.<br />\nTeam captain Scott Huber, wrestling in the 190-pound division,<br />\nrecorded the lone victory against Susquehanna.

In just a few<br />\nweeks, major league teams will<br />\ncommence spring training in<br />\nwarmer locales. And, as usual,<br />\nevery team will be showcasing a<br />\ncouple of new faces who will lead<br />\nthem to the World Series.<br />\nWhile the Dodgers, Blue Jays,<br />\nand Giants stole the headlines this<br />\nwinter with blockbuster trades<br />\nand free agent signings, general<br />\nmanager Roland Hemond has<br />\nkept the Orioles active with a few<br />\ntrades of his own.<br />\nFrank Robinson will finally<br />\nhave the homerun threat he has<br />\nbeen begging for the last two<br />\nyears. First baseman Glenn Davis<br />\njoins the Orioles after spending<br />\nhis first five years in the majors<br />\nin Houston. The Astros virtually<br />\ngave Davis to the Orioles because<br />\nhe is eligible for free agency<br />\nfollowing this season. Rather than<br />\nreceive a draft pick from the team<br />\nthat signed him (they wouldn't<br />\npay him enough to keep him), the<br />\nAstros traded for outfielder Steve<br />\nFinley and pitcher Pete Harnisch.<br />\nBaltimore benefits from the<br />\ntrade in many ways. Davis has hit<br />\nover thirty homeruns every<br />\nseason despite playing half his<br />\ngames in the spacious<br />\nAstrodome, a pitcher's paradise.<br />\nWith his power, he should easily<br />\nblast forty homers in the smaller<br />\nAmerican League ballparks. Cal<br />\nRipken should come back from<br />\nseveral 'mediocre' campaigns<br />\nwith the threat of Davis behind<br />\nhim in the batting order.<br />\nThe deal also gives Hemond<br />\nthe option of including David<br />\nSegui or Randy Milligan in a trade<br />\nfor some pitching. The Birds are<br />\ndesperate for quality starting pitching (isn't everybody), especially after dealing Pete Harnisch.<br />\nUnfortunately, Jim Palmer isn't<br />\nthe answer.<br />\nHemond has already attempted<br />\nto improve the starting pitching<br />\nby picking up Jeff Robinson from<br />\nthe Tigers in exchange for<br />\n<br />\nMickey Tettleton. The deal can't<br />\nhurt the Orioles, as Tettleton will<br />\nnever put up the numbers he did<br />\ntwo years ago. Robinson, of<br />\ncourse, had a phenomenal season<br />\nthree years ago, but blew out his<br />\narm and hasn't yet fully<br />\nrecovered. Last season, Robinson<br />\nwas erratic at best. He did,<br />\nhowever, provide quite a few<br />\nsouvenirs for the Detroit faithful.<br />\nBaltimore's only free agent<br />\nsigning is another risk. Outfielder/DH Dwight Evans brings<br />\nsixteen years of experience (but<br />\nno rings) to the clubhouse. While<br />\nEvans was once the premier<br />\n<br />\ndefensive rightfielder and one of<br />\nthe most consistent run producers<br />\nin the major leagues, a chronic<br />\nback problem has limited his outfield play the past two seasons.<br />\nHis bat will provide even more<br />\npower to a suddenly potent<br />\nOrioles lineup, but if he is limited<br />\nto DH duty, Evans will<br />\nsimultaneously weaken the lineup<br />\nby forcing the O's to play such<br />\ninferior outfielders as Brady<br />\nAnderson and Donnell Nixon.<br />\nUnfortunately for Birds fans,<br />\nthe Orioles are still a couple of<br />\ntrades away from a division title,<br />\neven in the A.L.(L)East.<br />\n<br />\nRegroup<br />\nby Ethan Skolnick<br />\nAfter stumbling to three consecutive losses, the Johns<br />\nHopkins men's fencing squad rebounded against Vassar and<br />\nSUNY Purchase with two impressive victories, raising their<br />\noverall record to 9-3.<br />\n\"We went through a slump,<br />\nbut I think we have it straightened out now,\" said foil captain<br />\nRichard Millhiser, a junior who<br />\nhas a 27-19 individual record.<br />\n\"All the weapons look strong<br />\nnow and our only goal is an MAC<br />\nChampionship.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays sport a solid 5-1<br />\nmark in MAC competition thus<br />\nfar.

Per continues to refuse<br />\nto tell me the true answer to the bonus question, so I<br />\ncontinue to contend that the secret message reads, \"The<br />\nowls are not what they seem.\" So sue me.<br />\n<br />\n111 OUS 110teS<br />\nSinging Valentinesare being sold for<br />\n$4.00 each and will be delivered<br />\nanywhere on campus on Thursday, Feb.<br />\n14 from 10 am to 9 pm.

Under the plan,<br />\nseveral departments will be<br />\nprevented from replacing retiring<br />\nfaculty members\u2014resulting in de<br />\nfacto staff cuts\u2014while other<br />\ndepartments will hold steady or<br />\nincrease their numbers slightly.<br />\nArmstrong declined to identify<br />\nthose departments that will be<br />\nnegatively affected.<br />\nThe plan intends to hold the<br />\noverall Arts and Sciences faculty at its current level of approximately 243, Armstrong said. He<br />\nnoted that the School's faculty has<br />\nfallen to 243 from 255 two years<br />\nago through a \"random process\"<br />\nof attrition.<br /><br />\nDean of the School of Arts and Sciences Lloyd Armstrong.<br /><br />\n\u2022 Armstrong said that he and<br />\nRichardson, who are considered<br />\nthe primary architects of the plan,<br />\n\"agreed that the current numbers<br />\nare the correct numbers.\" The<br />\npresent faculty level is \"what [the<br />\nSchool of Arts and Sciences] can<br />\nafford given [its] resources, aid,<br />\ngrants, and endowments,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"[I am] not saying that the present number is the right number.<br />\nTwenty-five to thirty more is probably the right number,\" Armstrong said. He said that the<br />\nSchool did not exist to support<br />\nmore faculty.<br />\nArmstrong said, however, that<br />\nthe Departments of Classics,<br />\nFrench, Cognitive Science,<br />\nMathematics, Political Science,<br />\nand Economics would benefit<br />\nunder the plan.<br />\nBoth Armstrong and Richardson are \"committed to an increase in the Arts and Sciences<br />\nendowment\" Armstrong said that<br />\nRichardson has made Homewood<br />\nhis \"highest priority,\" and expects a Homewood campaign to<br />\nbe launched soon.<br />\nRichardson confirmed this in a<br />\ntelephone interview Wednesday,<br />\nsaying that the University plans<br />\nto begin a fund-raising drive \"as<br />\nsoon as we can.\" Echoing the address he delivered at a faculty<br />\nmeeting Dec. 14, he said the only way to improve the situation<br />\nin Arts and Sciences is through<br />\nprivate giving. Richardson<br />\nrepeated his and Armstrong's<br /><br />\nbelief that it is \"not appropriate<br />\nto raise funds from the [University] endowment to cover the<br />\ndeficit [in Arts and Sciences].\"<br />\nPart of the reason for not<br />\nreleasing statistics on individual<br />\ndepartments, Armstrong said, is<br />\nthat it \"builds a self-fulfilling prophecy\" in which potential donors<br />\nmay become less willing to give.<br />\nArmstrong said that departments were evaluated and<br />\nranked in several categories, including the \"centrality of the program to to undergraduate education,\" the program's quality, and<br />\nundergraduate demand.

The first is<br />\ncapitalism; it preaches that every opportunity is here if one only goes<br />\nout and seeks it. The second is consumerism, which insists that<br />\nundergraduate education is the institution's primary objective. Or to<br />\ncombine the two: We're here to enrich you, but it won't be easy.<br />\nSo it's little wonder whenever a budget crisis comes rattling around<br />\nthe corner, administrators and students each have a righteous finger<br />\nto point. You said you were here for us , cry the students, and you<br />\nbroke your promise! The administration, meanwhile, regards the<br />\nstudents as it might a barking dog, and calmly responds, We are here<br />\nfor you. We have always been. But you aren't taking advantage of<br />\nthe excellent opportunities we offer here. Two parties speak, but the<br />\nresult is a pair of monologues\u2014and no progess.<br />\nCaught between all this posturing, meanwhile, and watching it in<br />\nsilence, the University faculty are struggling under a collection of<br />\ngrievances that, if uttered, would make Hamlet's famous soliloquy<br />\non suicide seem trifling by comparison. The faculty cuts, bigger<br />\nenrollments, and tuition hikes that have come to Hopkins in recent<br />\nyears\u2014thus forming the holy trinity of undergraduate complaints\u2014<br />\nare most punishing to the faculty members themselves. It doesn't<br />\ntake advanced calculations to determine the effect of fewer instructors, more students, and a drop in funds for teaching and research<br />\nassistants\u2014first it's fatigue, then impatience, and finally attrition.<br />\nThat attrition, despite what administrators might have you believe,<br />\ndoesn't always appear in the guise of a happy retirement. In recent<br />\nyears Hopkins has lost a disturbing number of excellent teachers and<br />\nscholars, and not to old age. The majority of the French department<br />\nmade its exit last year to Emory University; the Department of<br />\nClassics has seen its members escape to various schools around the<br />\ncountry; and some of the brightest lights in the English department<br />\nwere lured in by Duke several years ago. Taken alone, each of these<br />\nmight seem inconsequential\u2014just another ripple in the everyday affairs of a bustling, prestigious, internationally renowned university.<br />\nBut many faculty members suggest otherwise. In preparing its twopart article on the reshuffling of numbers within the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences\u2014the worst casualty of the financial crisis\u2014the NewsLetter encountered several active faculty members who were nothing<br />\nshort of disgusted with the way the University had treated them.<br />\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, many said that they didn't think<br />\nit likely that things would improve in the future. Several cited the<br />\nlack of funds for research and teaching assistants\u2014this despite increasing class sizes\u2014in a climate where professors are expected to<br />\npublish as frequently as before while carrying heavier teaching loads.<br /><br />\nIn a period of budgetary uncertainty, such comments may be taken<br />\nlightly. But the majority of these remarks came from senior tenured<br />\nprofessors\u2014none of them department chairs\u2014who suggested that<br />\ndiscontent is running at all-time high among Arts and Sciences faculty.<br />\nOne complained that there was no system to reward professors for<br />\n\"good behavior\": those who bore heavy loads of undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate teaching were given no \"handicaps,\"such as summer<br />\nresearch money or T.A. budgets, to compensate them for the time<br />\nthat their less popular collegues spent on research. This, another added, was the rule rather than the exception in a university whose<br />\naverage salaries continue to drop in relation to those at other top<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nAnother bone of contention among professors is the added perks<br />\nthat are showered on new tenured professors\u2014signing bonuses, in<br />\neffect, that award newcomers with a salary, a computer budget, and<br />\nadditional perks that far exceed those of professors with years, even<br />\ndecades, of seniority. It's part of the game of faculty hiring, perhaps,<br />\nbut that game can work in two ways\u2014as the depletion of Classics,<br />\nEnglish, and French have shown. Although senior faculty see the<br />\nneed to seduce new candidates, many suggest that Hopkins should<br />\nmake similar overtures to current faculty as well, if only as insurance<br />\nagainst additional departures. Said one professor: \"The University<br />\ncould buy a lot of [dissatisfied] people pretty cheaply.\"<br />\nBut now \"the financial bathtub is full,\" as another professor phrased<br />\nit, and such changes aren't likely to occur soon. But money is by<br />\nno means the only source of faculty discontent. When asked what<br />\nthe University might do to improve faculty morale, one professor<br />\nreplied, \"Listen to us, for one thing.\" Many complicated questions<br />\nhave arisen from the recent evaluation of Arts &amp; Sciences<br />\ndepartments\u2014what the University's academic priorities are, how it<br />\ndetermines them, and if the Hopkins professoriate will ever have a<br />\nvoice in the process. These are\u2014as an administrator might reply\u2014<br />\ninteresting questions, and they deserve thoughtful, cogent, and prompt<br />\nanswers.<br />\nThey also deserve the support of students, who should realize that<br />\nthe problems they perceive with the University now are nothing compared to what additional faculty losses might bring. One hopes that,<br />\nas Armstrong and Richardson juggle the dozens of interests that their<br />\njobs comprise, they remember that consumer and capitalist are foiled alike if there is no product to offer. Chances are good that they<br />\nknow the answer to the question posed by the headline. It will be<br />\na test of their commitment to Arts and Sciences to see if they can<br />\neventually answer it, honestly, with \"no one.\"<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nQuestioning an Ancient Greek Ritual; Sexist Critic?<br /><br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nDouglass Barre<br /><br />\nEpisode Twelve:<br />\nSignum Registration<br />\nMiranda had set her alarm<br />\nclock for five in the morning.<br />\nNormally, Miranda considered<br />\nfive in the morning a place on par<br />\nwith the fourth circle of hell, but<br />\nthis was one of those occasions<br />\nwhen Miranda's academic duty<br />\ncalled for effort above and<br />\nbeyond its normal demands.<br />\nJanuary registration was one of<br />\nthem. Not everybody got up at<br />\nfive in the morning for January<br />\nregistration, but not everybody<br />\nwas trying to get into Professor<br />\nMulvilhill's expanded psychology<br />\nseminar on pop culture as the incarnation of the collective<br />\nsubconscious.<br />\nMiranda noticed, as she<br />\nslammed the alarm clock into the<br />\nplastic milk crate it sat upon, that<br />\nthe sun had not risen. Miranda's<br />\ntwo rules of thumb explicitly<br />\nstated that when she woke up, the<br />\nsun should be up, and when she<br />\nwent to sleep, it had better be<br />\ndown. Nothing upset Miranda<br />\nmore than looking up from a late<br />\nnight paper to see that the sun had<br />\nbegun to rise. It made it very difficult for her to continue to convince herself that it was still Tuesday night, when Wednesday morning was bouncing off her mirror into her face. The only thing<br />\nworse than that, Miranda<br />\nthought, noting that the night's<br />\nlactic acid buildup had effectively paralyzed her entire body, was<br />\ntrying to tell yourself it was<br />\nWednesday morning when an<br />\naching back, crusty eyes, and a<br />\nfairly active dream life wanted<br />\nyou to believe it was still Tuesday night.<br />\nMiranda had had enough<br />\nforesight to fill out her registration form ahead of time. All she<br />\nneeded were the signatures to<br />\nauthenticate her last semester in<br />\nwas<br />\nshe<br />\nand<br />\nschool<br />\nbureaucratically stable for the rest<br />\nof her scholarly career.<br />\nShe didn't notice what clothes<br />\nshe was putting on. She didn't<br />\ncare what she had to eat. She<br /><br />\nhardly even noticed Zack asleep<br />\non the couch, a pink registration<br />\nform blank on the floor next to<br />\nhim.

I find it<br />\nincomprehensible after reading the<br />\nDecember 7th issue of the NewsLetter that more is being done to rid<br />\nthe campus of smokers than to<br />\nROTC/nonthe<br />\nresolve<br />\ndiscriminatory policy conflict or to<br />\nsave the social psychology program<br />\nfrom extinction.<br />\nI came to Hopkins with no worries about the credibility of a<br />\nHopkins education. As a double major in French and psychology, I have<br />\nsince changed my mind and am<br />\nseriously considering transferring,<br />\nsomething my freshman naivete<br />\nwould never have allowed me to<br />\nconsider. However, after the massexodus of the French department and<br />\nthe impending extinction of social<br />\npsychology here, I continually ask<br />\nmyself, \"Why am I here?\"<br />\nIt's time for the administration to<br />\nget its priorities straight. In the midst<br />\nof a deteriorating undergraduate<br />\nacademic program and social conflict, all the administration can offer is rhetoric. We need action now,<br />\nbefore the detrimental effects of the<br />\nfive year plan are manifested in some<br />\nother department. What does our<br />\n$15 thousand tuition go toward,<br />\nanyway?<br />\nBut Bradley Cohen, writer of the<br />\nEgo Dico column, makes me feel<br />\nI'm alone in my concerns. In the<br />\nDecember 7th issue of the NewsLetter, Mr. Cohen listed several<br />\nissues which were \"so miniscule as<br />\nto not warrant a list of them.\" These<br />\n\"non-events\" included the creation<br />\nof a women's studies program, the<br />\nMSE symposium on race relations,<br />\nand the ROTC debate, all issues that<br />\nI feel require enormous attention and<br />\nare perhaps the most important<br />\nissues on campus. If Mr. Cohen's<br />\ncallousness is representative of the<br />\nmajority of the student body, I<br />\ndouble question any socially conscious person's role at this university of higher learning.<br />\nDanielle Picher<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nGreek systems nationally are on<br />\nthe chopping block as incubators of<br />\nalcohol abuse, hazing, racism, and<br />\nsexual harassment. I think anyone<br />\nwho has been to a fraternity party<br />\nhere at Hopkins can attest that such<br />\nthings not only exist within our community, but are not hard to find.<br />\nOn December 7th, 1990,1 was invited to Alpha Tau Omega's holiday<br />\ncelebration by, among others, the<br />\nfraternity's president. I arrived late,<br /><br />\ncalled<br />\nsomething<br />\nduring<br />\n\"Songfest\"\u2014an ATO ritual involving songs and limericks, the point of<br />\nwhich is for the brothers to poke fun<br />\nat each other. It is supposed to be<br />\namusing, but can get quite lewd. I<br />\nwas shocked and upset to be included as one of the subjects of the most<br />\nobscene limerick of the night! The<br />\nremark, however based on an actuality, was a personal affair and no<br />\nbusiness of the affronting parties, let<br />\nalone the rest of the room. The<br />\nSongfest material is prepared ahead<br />\nof time by a committee and is supposed to be checked and/or censored<br />\nby the Executive Board. This time,<br />\nthat procedure was not followed<br />\ncarefully enough. I cannot believe<br />\nthat this could have not been<br />\nprevented!<br />\nHopkins is such a small place; it<br />\nis difficult to avoid the rumors that<br />\ninevitably float around. As a<br />\nwoman, I feel particularly<br />\nvulnerable. There is a huge double<br />\nstandard between what is acceptable<br />\nfor women to do and what is acceptable for men. Understanding that<br />\npeople make mistakes, I went to the<br />\nthree brothers most responsible seeking apologies. One brother said,<br />\n\"No. You weren't even supposed to<br />\nbe there,\" and another stubbornly<br />\nrefused. I informed ATO's President<br />\nof their attitudes and soon they had<br />\nboth been coerced into giving me<br />\n\"sincere\" apologies. The third had<br />\nreadily apologized and accepted<br />\nmuch of the blame for the Songest<br />\nremarks\u2014he said something along<br />\nthe same lines as the night before,<br />\nat the monthly fraternity meeting. He<br />\nfelt that his indiscretion had encouraged the inclusion of that piece<br />\nof information in the next night's<br />\nSongfest lyrics.<br />\nSeveral women who have since<br />\nfound out about the incident have<br />\ntold me that they are offended by the<br />\nway women in general get treated by<br />\nfraternities, and a few could relate<br />\nsimilar personal experiences. I can't<br /><br />\nbelieve that this sort of thing goes on<br />\nall the time and no one seems to care<br />\nenough to do anything about it.<br />\nWomen should refuse to be subjected to such discriminatgion. Some<br />\nbrothers do seem genuinely concerned for my feelings, and to their<br />\ncredit, ATO has since sent me<br />\nflowers and made other attempts to<br />\nameliorate the situation.<br />\nThat fraternities can take what<br />\nshould be private and turn it into a<br />\npublic spectacle, especially when it<br />\ninvolves sexual exploits and the objectification of women is infuriating.<br />\nIf ATO could live up to its \"commitment\" (see the Rush book), all<br />\nwomen, including myself, should<br />\ngreatly appreciate it.<br />\nBrooke Gallagher<br /><br />\nTo the Editors:.<br />\nCongratulations to the Hopkins<br />\nTheatre lab and the Goucher Department of Theatre for the fantastic job<br />\nthey did with \"Different Voices,<br />\nDifferent Worlds\" last weekend. All<br />\nof the original one-act plays were<br />\nwell-written, professionally acted,<br />\nand thoroughly enjoyable. To top it<br />\noff, the performance was free of<br />\ncharge.

I went to the<br />\nNews-Letter office a week before the<br />\nfirst weekend of the show (which<br />\nran, for the first time since its creation, for two weekends instead of<br />\none) and asked to have the first Fri-<br /><br />\nLetters Policy<br />\nThe News-Letter welcomes<br />\nletters to the editors. Letters<br />\nmust be typed, double spaced, and Include the author's<br />\nname and telephone for<br />\nverification purposes. The<br />\nNews-Letter reserves the<br />\nright to edit for condensation.<br />\nLetters must be delivered to<br />\nthe Gatehouse by Tuesday at<br />\n5 p.m. for inclusion in that<br />\nFriday's paper. Once a letter<br />\nis delivered, it becomes the<br /><br />\nproperty of the News-Letter.<br />\nLetters must be no more than<br />\n350 words and signed by at<br />\nleast one person and no more<br />\nthan two persons. Letters<br />\ncredited only to organizations<br />\nwill not be printed. Due to<br />\nthe volume of letters received, not all can be printed. We<br />\nreserve the right to limit the<br />\nnumber of letters printed in<br />\na given issue.<br /><br />\nday and/or Saturday reviewed. I did<br />\nthis for two reasons. First, a review<br />\nis the best publicity a performance<br />\ncan have; it would have encouraged<br />\nstudents who missed it the first<br />\nweekend to attend the shows the second weekend. Second, the<br />\ncriticisms of a knowledgable and experienced theater critic can help the<br />\nmembers of an improvisational<br />\ngroup to refine its work. The absense<br />\nof a review after the first weekend<br />\nwas glaring and unprofessional,<br />\nespecially considering that I received a promise from the Editor-inChief that a reviewer would be present. I don't know where the fault<br />\nrests, but this kind of failure should<br />\nnot happen again.<br />\nMy second criticism concerns the<br />\nlanguage and tone of the review,<br />\nwhich I (and a fellow \"Throat<br />\nCulture\" member) believe had sexist implications. Kevin Dorgan and<br />\nErik Bertin, my fellow cast<br />\nmembers, were highlighted (and<br />\nrightly so) as especially talented<br />\ncomics. Later in the review, I was<br />\nreferred to as the most talented of the<br />\nfemale cast members; a comic who<br />\nhad \"no trouble keeping up with the<br />\nfast pace of the show.\" First of all,<br />\nwhy the qualifier? Why are Mr.<br />\nDorgan and Mr. Bertin simply<br />\ntalented cast members, when I am a<br />\nfemale cast member? Does gender<br />\ncreate a difference in the analysis of<br />\ncomedy? If I'm funny, I'm funny,<br />\nregardless of my gender. If I'm not<br />\nas talented as Mr. Dorgan and Mr.<br />\nBertin (and it is a claim I wouldn't<br />\nrefute; they are wonderfully talented<br />\nindividuals who deserve special<br />\nrecognition), then I should not be<br />\nrecognized in a review. If the most<br />\ntalented members of any given cast<br />\nrepresent only one gender, so be it.<br />\nSecondly, it is hardly a positive condition of talent to \"keep up with\"<br />\nthe pace of a performance. I thank<br />\nyou for praising my \"faces and accents,\" but a mere ability to keep up<br />\nhas nothing to do with comic ability. How you determined, moreover,<br />\nthat I was \"keeping up with\" as opposed to, perhaps, setting, or merely working with the pace is beyond<br />\nme. What would one think if, in<br />\nanalyzing Mr. Edelman's review, I<br />\nwere to say, \"Mr. Edelman, a very<br />\ntalented male reporter for the NewsLetter, shows a remarkable ability to<br />\nkeep up with the pace of the English<br />\nlangauge?\"<br />\nI emphasize this contention of sexism because it was and is a constant<br />\nstruggle for women in comedy to<br />\nsecure roles in which their sexuality, or femininity, are not vehicles for<br />\nmen's comedic talents. Even in<br />\n\"Throat Culture,\" where cast<br />\nmembers traditionally have been<br /><br />\nContinued on page 7<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/7<br /><br />\nClose Enough<br />\nThe Department of Bad Things<br />\nreleased a study (A Conspectus<br />\non Bad Things in American<br />\nSociety, newshounds) which<br />\nstated that, as Bad Things go,<br />\nstress and drug abuse were<br />\nsecond only to the media's<br />\noveruse of the word \"Scud.\" I<br />\ncalled the Department's public<br />\nrelations man, but they told me<br />\nthat he was so depressed that he<br />\nrefused to talk to anyone.

The 2001 skit mocking the<br />\nLacrosse players was not designed<br />\nto suggest that primitive man underwent a beautiful evolution to become<br />\nHopkins Lacrosse players. On the<br />\ncontrary, it was not, as you say,<br />\n\"positive,\" but perhaps the most<br />\nsardonic and bitter of the skits<br />\n(which accounts for its success).<br />\n2001 simply suggested that Lacrosse<br />\nplayers are Neanderthals. Harsh as<br /><br />\nthis literalism is, the comedy of the<br />\npiece is the truth from which such<br />\na criticism springs, which includes<br />\nthe special academic treatment of not<br />\nnecessarily academically special<br />\nstudents, the ridiculous glorification<br />\nof lacrosse at Hopkins, etc.<br />\nIf we failed to get that message<br />\nacross, then that is one thing.

As 1991<br />\nbegins, should we filmgoers expect a rash of changes,<br />\nHollywood hand-wringing, or,<br />\nGod forbid, better films?<br />\nNot a chance. All this angst is<br />\nbecause the industry grossed only five billion dollars last year, a<br />\nfew million off 1989's record<br />\ntotals.<br />\nIn fact, the box office was way<br />\ndown until. November, when<br />\nHome Alone came out of nowhere<br />\nto make a killing, recently surpassing Ghost as the biggest<br />\ngrossing film of the year.

There's a small group of<br />\nHopkins and Goucher students,<br />\nhowever, who annually bear the<br />\nbrunt of Baltimore life three extra weeks of the year for the sake<br />\nof Art. The product of their efforts, the Theater Lib (subtitled<br />\n\"Different Voices,<br />\n, Different<br />\nWorlds\"), was resented last<br />\nweekend in the Arlan()Theater<br />\n26.<br />\nand<br />\n25<br />\nJanuary<br />\nSimilar to the Barnstormers'<br />\nFreshman One-Ads, Theater Lab<br />\n'consists of severa shorter pieces,<br />\nsome no more an five or six<br />\nminutes in 1ngth. Unlike<br />\nanything else pit on at Hopkins,<br />\nhowever, theseplays are all written and perfoimed by students.<br />\nThe results, vhile not as polished as the miinstream stuff, are<br />\noften more ecclectic and<br />\npersonable.<br />\nStanding lead and shoulders<br />\nabove the osier pieces was T.J.<br />\nBarkwill's \"Seven Ways to<br />\nJack.\" Theplay is essentially a<br />\nmonologue by the disgruntled<br />\nmain chacter, Jack, who is<br />\nfrustrated with his severely<br />\nretarded ttster Cathy and the<br />\ndirection cf his life in general. As<br />\nJack, Joslqua Coleman gives one<br />\nof the bost performances seen<br />\nrecently (ti the Arellano stage; his<br />\nmixture cf cruelty and tenderness<br />\nis electrfying. Michelle Clay as<br />\nCathy las a slightly easier task<br />\n(she ha, no real dialogue), and<br />\ndeliver/ a thoroughly convincing<br />\nacting<br />\nTwcof the monologues, Doug<br />\nBarre;\"Wheelchair\" and Sarah<br /><br />\nMorton's \"Hives,\" deal with<br />\nsexual frustration and anxiety<br />\nfrom the woman's point of view.<br />\nJennifer Popky's crippled narrator in the former provides a unique and refreshing view of the<br />\nsexual act, one that transcends<br />\nmere physical passion. Barre<br />\nwisely steers clear of excessive<br />\nsentiment and self-pity, and<br />\nPopky does a fairly good job of<br />\ngetting the audience to empathize<br />\nwith her.<br />\nThe character in Sarah Morton's \"Hives\" has similar problems relating to men; her witty<br />\ntale of botched seduction drew<br />\nrounds of sympathetic laughter<br />\nfrom the female portion of the audience. Unfortunately, the show<br />\nI attended had an understudy performance for this piece; I am<br />\ntherefore unable to review Nancy Warner's presentation.<br />\nChristie Schlesinger in the<br />\nsubstitute role gave a very ontarget exhibition of the material<br />\nnonetheless.<br />\nRebeccca Garron's monologue<br />\n\"Deconstruction\" also involves<br />\nanxiety, but in a much more<br />\ntongue-in-cheek fashion. The<br />\nWoody Allenesque lines flow<br />\nquickly and smoothly; the problem is that this entire thing has<br />\nbeen done before. As in the Morton monologue, I was only able<br />\nto see the understudy performance of this piece; Julia Ro does<br />\na good job, not Garron herself<br />\nwould have done a better one.<br />\nProbably the most accessible<br />\nwork in the show was Arturo Interian's \"Homestead Shuffle.\"<br />\nFull of witty lines and quick<br />\ncaricatures, \"Shuffle\" played out<br />\nlike a competent television sitcom. The formula is a familiar<br />\none. Take a charming Puerto<br />\nRican expatriate (Jason Katz) and<br /><br />\npit him up against a boorish<br />\nAmerican redneck (Stefan Tornquist). Add a shuffleboard competition at local bar and a potential romance with a Cuban widow<br />\n(Maryam Khadadoust). What you<br />\nget is a Latino-tinged morality<br />\nplay, very predictable but<br />\ngenerally humorous and wellacted.<br />\nThe third play in the bunch,<br />\nNelson Inz's \"The Underdogs,\"<br />\nis an earnest but ultimately<br />\nfailed locker room comedy. Andrew Bragen plays Bruno, a<br />\nHolden Caufield character who is<br />\nsick of always being the loser.<br />\nBragen has a few good serious<br />\nmoments, but it's Doug Barre's<br />\nnaive Lenny that carries the piece<br />\nthrough its awkward portions.<br />\nJessica Mathewson's \"The<br />\nParty\" ended up this year's<br />\nTheatre Lab with a quick shot of<br />\nblack humor. Mathewson shows<br />\nus a nuclear family that's so incredibly obnoxious that only<br />\nmurder and mayhem could result,<br />\nand it does. From a technical<br />\naspect, \"The Party\" was the<br />\nsloppiest play of the bunch; some<br />\nof the lines were garbled and the<br />\ntiming was off at times. But this<br />\ncriticism ignores some of the funniest moments of the entire<br />\nTheatre Lab, notably the \"Love<br />\nBoat\" celebration at the tail end<br />\nand the grating bursts of song by<br />\ndaughter Monica (Lucia Bowes).<br />\nOverall, what can be said about<br />\nthe undergraduate play-wrights at<br />\nJohns Hopkins? Well, if there<br />\nwere no Pulitzer Prize winners in<br />\nthe batch, the collection was<br />\ngenerally worthy of the Writing<br />\nSeminars name.

Alice Tate (Mia<br />\nFarrow) is a chronically fretful<br />\nNew York housewife, who<br />\nspends her busy days shopping<br />\nand rushing from one mysterious<br />\nsocial appointment to another.<br />\nAlice has a phantom pain in her<br />\nback, but acupuncturist Dr. Yang<br />\n(the late Keye Luke) diagnoses<br />\nproblems of the heart and mind,<br />\nnot the lumbar vertebrea. With<br />\nYang's herbal potions as her<br />\nguide, Alice sheds her inhibitions<br />\nand goes on an adventure, taking<br />\nup with a divorced horn player<br />\n(Joe Mantegna) and battling her<br />\ndisinterested husband (William<br />\nHurt) in an effort to find meaning and purpose in her life. The<br />\ncaper quality seems a stretch for<br />\nAllen; his moments of humor<br />\ndon't usually rely on his main<br />\ncharacters turning invisible, or<br />\nflying, literally, over the Manhattan skyline. But there are several<br />\ntruly wonderful scenes in Alice\u2014<br />\nsome funny, others touching, all<br />\ndirected with the panache of a<br />\ndirector who, unlike so many,<br />\nseems to know what he's doing.<br /><br />\nThe ending is a rush job, sensible but far too neat for a film and<br />\ndirector who mocks life's<br />\nneatness at every turn. But<br />\noverall, buoyed by Farrow's<br />\nstrongest performance since Purple Rose of Cairo and first-rate<br />\nproduction qualitites, Alice is certainly worth a look.<br />\nAwakenings - When introverted<br />\nneurologist Malcolm Sayer<br />\n(Robin Williams) stumbles upon<br />\na group of lifeless chronic<br />\nhospital patients in 1969, some<br />\nasleep for decades, he thinks he's<br />\nfound the perfect working environment. That is, until he tests<br />\nan experimental drug on Leonard<br />\nRowe (Robert DeNiro), who<br />\nwakes and begins life again with<br />\nall the wonder of a young boy<br />\ntaking his first, delicate steps.<br />\nSoon the entire ward (known by<br />\nthe orderlies as the garden: \"we<br />\nfeed 'em and we water 'em\") is<br />\non its feet, mostly reveling in<br />\nlife's simpler joys, like a comb<br />\nthrough the hair or feeding<br />\noneself. A miracle? Perhaps, until the wonder drug's heartbreaking side effects kick in. DeNiro's<br />\nprecise acting is almost painful to<br />\nwatch\u2014as a vegetable with a personality suddenly foisted upon<br /><br />\nhim, and then almost snatched<br />\naway, he's got little room for er7<br />\nror. Williams plays Sayer with an<br />\nearnestness and awkwardness that<br />\nis at once frustrating and right on.<br />\nBased on the book by Oliver<br />\nSacks, and written by Steven<br />\nZaillan, Awakening has an almost<br />\nunremitting\u2014and I'm certain,<br />\nunintentional\u2014bleakness to it;<br />\nother than a few overtly<br />\nmanipulated moments, director<br />\nPenny Marshall's tale is straight<br />\nfrom the heart.

Sitting in a room in the Hotel Splendour, drinking whisky and<br />\nwincing with pain after each<br />\nswig, sits Cesar Castillo, exMambo King, allowing himself to<br />\nbecome a shadow.<br />\nDespite being \"blessed with<br />\ntremendous energy, a surge of<br />\npower from too many slaps in the<br />\nface from his foul-tempered<br />\nfather,\" Cesar is now fat, sick,<br />\ndrunk, tired. Despite this apparant lack of energy, the novel<br /><br />\nitself often moves quickly, picking up the beat of the rhumba, the<br />\nmambo, and the cha-cha.<br />\nOn the surface, Mambo Kings<br />\nis the story oftwo brothers born<br />\nin a small town in Oriente Province, Cuba who, despite their<br />\ndifferences of character, bond<br />\ntogether through their music.<br />\nBeginning in lively Havana, they<br />\nmove on to New York and their<br />\npeak ofpopularity by appearing<br />\non ILove Lucy. The death of their<br />\nyounger brother Nestor,<br />\nhowever,jars Cesar so much that<br />\nhe is unable to compose and<br />\nbegins instead to look back on his<br />\nlife.<br />\nIn a way, Cesar becomes the<br />\nstereotypical macho latino who<br />\nknows how to get women to<br />\nplease him sexually, while Nestor<br />\nis quiet, introverted and broken<br />\nhearted. As the author himself<br />\nsays, \"Cesar was un macho<br />\ngrande; Nestor, un infeliz.\"<br /><br />\nBut one cannot summarize the<br />\nbook so quickly. The characters<br />\nare torn away from stereotype by<br />\nthe details and description of<br />\nNestor's love affair with Maria,<br />\nof how she makes him feel<br />\n\"alive, cono!\" or of Cesar's<br />\nregrets about his marriage.<br />\nWe find out that shy, \"saintly\" Nestor is capable of incredible sexual activity while macho,<br />\ndevil-may-care Cesar is capable<br />\nof loving a woman enough to<br />\nmarry her. Unfortunately, Maria<br />\nabandons Nestor leaving him to<br />\ncheat on his wife and ask himself<br />\nwhat he is doing with his youth.<br />\nThe book then is not just about<br />\ntwo gallegos; or arrogant<br />\nCubans. Simply because these<br />\ntwo men are brothers, they are<br />\ncapable of caring deeply about<br />\neach other as well as for the rest<br />\nof their \"family.\"<br />\nDespite the macho attitude of<br />\nthe novel, especially of its cen-<br /><br />\nAn Excerpt from<br />\nThe Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love<br />\nLooking at her, Nestor felt faint-hearted: she was<br />\nmore beautiful than the sea, than the morning light,<br />\nthan a wildflower field, and her whole body, agitated<br />\nand sweaty from her struggles, gave off an aromatic<br />\nfemale scent, somewhere between meat and perfume<br />\nand ocean air, that assailed Nestor's nostrils, sank<br />\ndown into his body like mercury, and twisted in his<br />\ngut like Cupid's naughty arrow. He was so shy that<br />\nhe couldn't look at her anymore, and she liked this,<br />\nbecause men were always looking at her.<br />\n\"My name is Maria,\" she told him.<br />\n\"Nestor's mine,\" he told her quietly.<br />\nShe was twenty-two years old and had left her small<br />\npueblo by the sea for Havana, where she had been living for the last few years working as a dancer in different little Havana nightclubs. He wasn't surprised<br />\nto hear that she was a dancer: she had a nice body and<br /><br />\nstrong-looking curvaceous legs, with muscles that were<br />\nround and delicate. She was a mulata beauty with the<br />\nhigh cheek bones of the forties, a pouty, seductive double for Rita Hayworth. And the man with whom she<br />\nhad been fighting?<br />\n\"Someone who was once good to me.\"<br />\nHe passed the night with her in the cafe eating paella<br />\nand drinking wine and telling her everything about his<br />\nshort life, his childhood illnesses, his sense of unworthiness, his fears that he could never be a real macho<br />\nin the kingdom of machos. Her state of pain and her<br />\nthrobbing vulnerability spoke to his own pain. Each<br />\nof his stories entered Maria, his new confidante, the<br />\nonly woman in the world to whom he had spoken so,<br />\nMaria, to whom in the end, these confessions would<br />\nmean nothing.<br /><br />\ntral character Ceasar, the women<br />\nare not overlooked. One of the<br />\nmost important characters is<br />\nMaria, the elusive beauty who<br />\nbreaks Nestor's heart. In fact<br />\nNestor is so consumed with<br />\nshowing her that he loves her in<br />\nspite of everything, he composes<br />\na love song for her called<br />\n\"Beautiful Maria of My Soul.\"<br />\nAnd it is the pain and beauty<br />\nof this song which gives Cesar<br />\nCastillo and his band their peak<br />\nof fame. Desi Arnaz, the hero of<br />\nCuban musicians, hears the song<br />\nand asks them to perform it on his<br />\nshow. The repetition of the<br />\ndescription of this episode<br />\nthroughout the novel provides it<br />\nwith a freeze-frame quality. It is<br />\nin watching this episode that<br />\nCesar remembers and relives his<br />\ntime with Nestor.<br />\nDespite the importance of<br />\nNestor to Cesar, there are other<br />\nnames that are important to him.<br />\nFirst comes Luisa, the girl that he<br />\nmarries and with whom he has<br />\none daughter, Mariela. No matter how many other \"chicks he<br />\nhas had, Cesar cannot forget<br />\nLuisa, and cannot help but regret<br />\nthat his daughter doesn't even<br />\nknow him.<br />\nAnother name in his memory<br />\nis Delores. Delores who immerses herself in books because<br />\nthey help her to cope with the<br />\nemptiness of her own life.<br />\nDelores who falls in love with<br />\nNestor, marries him and has one<br />\nson and one daughter with him<br />\nbut who is continually confounded by Nestor's \"growing distance<br />\nfrom her.\" Delores who, after<br />\nthe death of Nestor, marries a<br />\nquiet man who won't give her any<br /><br />\n50: How NANly OF<br /><br />\npuwoNb-07.5 INHAr-<br /><br />\nHApp.NFJ) To NEsroR<br /><br />\nCi-sAR<br />\nfr1An160 KIN051 AF -PAZfliER. cAsnuz)<br />\nBRIEF<br />\nA PPEAR4NC=4 ON \"1<br />\nLuc ?\"<br /><br />\n5OLV!\"-MYSE-3z),Atirdzic4!

But give Mel<br />\nGibson a chance. While he may<br />\nnot be Olivier, and Hamlet may<br />\nnot be the Mad Max of the 14th<br />\ncentury, under the direction of<br />\nFranco Zeffirelli, he successfully brings the Melancholy Dane to<br />\nfiery life.<br />\nGibson's Hamlet, tense and<br />\nsweaty, stalks the halls of<br />\nElsinore in wide-eyed desperation, and Gibson negotiates the<br />\ntwists and turns of his character<br />\nremarkably well. He is at once<br />\nthe lyrically sad prince of poetry,<br />\nand the mean, brooding lunatic<br />\nthat mocks his friends, rejects his<br />\nlover and carelessly spears the<br />\ncourt adviser.<br />\nThere are some lapses: there<br />\nare moments when the old Lethal<br />\nWeapon bravado begins to creep<br />\ninto his act, and you half expect<br />\nhim to crash through a window<br />\nor stick a gun in his mouth. At<br />\nhis worst, Hamlet's Melancholy<br />\ngives way to Gibson's Mel, and<br />\nhe seems to be grandstanding,<br />\njust another pop actor that always<br />\nwanted to \"do\" Hamlet.

Bottom line, however, is<br />\nthat this is a film that no one<br />\nwants to see right now, even if it<br />\nwasn't completely predictable,<br />\nembarrassingly acted, and filled<br />\nwith military humor that even a<br />\ngung-ho Persian Gulf enthusiast<br />\nwould be hard-pressed to enjoy.<br />\nMost notable aspect of the film<br />\nscreening was the audience:<br />\npublicists invited over two hundred fourth-year cadets from the<br />\nnearby Naval Academy, who<br />\nwatched the combat scenes with<br />\nsomething less than unrestrained<br />\nenthusiam.

Al<br />\nPacino returns as Michael Corleone, the aging Don who makes<br />\na final effort against failing health<br />\nto take the crime family out of the<br />\ngambling business and into<br />\nlegitimate affairs.

Unfortunately, the INS sees through<br />\nthe charade, and the couple is<br />\nforced to live together for a<br />\nweekend and invent a life<br />\ntogether to pass the scrutiny of the<br />\nFeds. Peter Weir's first film since<br />\nDead Poet Society starts<br />\nawkwardly, but finds its way<br />\nsomewhere in the middle and<br />\nfinishes with a flourish. Weir,<br />\nwho wrote and directed, brings a<br />\ncertain grace and charm to an<br />\notherwise grimy New York, and<br />\nplaces the characters in enough<br />\ninteresting situations to make it<br />\nwork. It's a flimsy premise\u2014<br />\nhardly helped by McDowell's<br />\ntoothy smile and L'oreal brand of<br />\nfrigid acting\u2014but Depardieu<br />\nshows why he's considered the<br />\ngreatest actor in France today. His<br />\nlumbering bulk shoulders the<br />\ndramatic weight until the narrative takes flight.

The characters are<br />\nso completely unredeemable (and<br />\nso completely realized by the actors) that they practically jump off<br />\nthe screen and pull you down into the mud with them. Think that<br />\nFrears and screenwriter Donald<br />\nWestlake can't go any further,<br />\nand they surprise you again and<br />\nagain. The script is filled with<br />\nblistering dialogue, lines like \"he<br />\nwas so crooked he could eat soup<br />\nwith a corkscrew.\" There's<br />\nnothing more satisfying than a<br />\nperfect heist, and The Grifters<br />\nwill leave you begging for<br />\nmore\u2014and wanting a shower.<br />\nHome Alone - Am I the only person in the world who found this<br />\nfilm completely worthless? I'm<br />\nstarting to think so, based on the<br />\nmountains of ticket-buyers who<br />\ncontinue to eat up this mindless,<br />\npredictable, sadistic fare from<br />\ndirector Chris Columbus and<br />\nconglomerate John Hughes. Tyke<br />\ndujour Macauley Culkin stars as<br />\nKevin, an eight-year old pipsqueak who's accidentally left<br />\nbehind when his family jets to<br />\nParis for Christmas vacation,<br />\nforced to defend the homefront<br />\nfrom the dumbest predators this<br />\nside of Wile E.

There's no doubt about<br />\nHome Alone's good intentions,<br />\nbut there's talk of this film<br />\nchallenging E. T. as the biggest<br />\nmoney-maker of all time. Spare<br />\nme.<br />\nKindergarten Cop - Big man Arnold Schwarzenegger is baaaack<br />\nin this likable, occasionally<br />\nbloody light fare from director<br />\nIvan Reitman (Twins). The<br />\nAustrian Kennedy-in-law stars as<br />\nL.A. cop John Kimble, forced into undercover work with tediously hungry partner Phoebe<br />\n(Pamela Reed) in a sleepy pacific<br />\ntown. The mission: pinpoint the<br />\nwoman who has stolen millions<br />\nfrom her drug kingpin husband,<br />\nfor she's the only one who can<br />\nsend him to jail.

After<br />\nlanding in Massachusetts, Mrs.<br />\nFlax strikes up a romance with a<br />\nbalding (and very hairy) shoe<br />\nsalesman (Bob Hoskins), while<br />\nCharlotte pursues the brooding<br />\nhunk who works at the local convent (Michael Schoeffling). The<br />\nFlaxes are amusing and weird,<br />\nand Ryder and Cher sparkle as<br />\nthey bicker. But June Roberts'<br />\nscript is filled with a useless narration by Charlotte, and so much<br />\nattempted button-pushing that if<br />\nit pushed any harder, the audience would find itself knocked<br />\non its keister in the theatre lobby. There's a family crisis, of<br />\ncourse, followed by a little family violence, some family tears,<br />\nand the usual conclusion, a Big<br />\nFamily Love-In. In fact,<br />\neverything about these mediocre<br />\nMermaids is a bit too familiar.<br />\nThe Russia House - Australian<br />\ndirector<br />\nFred<br />\nSchepsi's<br />\nmethodical, excessively literate<br />\nadaptation of John Le Carre's<br />\nthriller generates an improbable<br />\namount of heat, thanks to a<br />\nfreshly genuine setting, and the<br />\nperformances of stars Michelle<br />\nPfeiffer and Sean Connery. The<br />\nplot is a slight one, as Cold War<br /><br />\nThe Sheltering Sky - Bernardo<br />\nBertolucci's thoughtful adaptation<br />\nof the reputedly inaccessible 1949<br />\nnovel by Pual Bowles (who appears as the narrator of the film)<br />\nis perhaps too introspective for its<br />\nown good, or the good of the audience, for that matter. Three<br />\nAmericans\u2014Port and Kit<br />\nMoresby (John Malkovich and<br />\nDebra Winger), and George<br />\nTurner (Campbell Scott) begin a<br />\nsoul-searching journey in<br />\nTangier, unsure of future destinations, or what they expect to<br />\ndiscover within them. A brief affair between Kit and George ensues, and there is much pondering of life's bigger questions in<br />\ndiscussions that regrettably mirror the aimlessness of the<br />\nwanderers<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nMalkovich is suitably pensive as<br />\nPort, but Winger seems, well,<br />\nlost. The scenery is gorgeous,<br />\nthough a twenty minute stretch<br />\nwith nary a snippet of English<br />\ndialogue might lose even the hardiest of travellers. As far as action goes, Bertolucci and cowriter Mark Peploe seem to<br />\nprefer that it go on behind<br />\nclosed mental doors. At once baffling and beautiful, The Sheltering Sky remains a bewildering,<br />\nsensual mystery.

Levy pointed out that the Arab<br />\nnations have always been<br />\nsuspicious of the West, and that<br />\nIsrael's peaceful relations with the<br />\nU.S. have provoked and will continue to cause hostilities between<br />\nIsrael and other Arab nations after<br /><br />\nthe war between the U.S.-led<br />\nalliance and Iraq is over.<br />\nLevy hopes that the Arabs will<br />\nbe able to settle the conflict in the<br />\nMiddle East on their own, with<br />\nthe United Nations overseeing but<br />\nnot actively engineering the<br />\nresolution of political unrest in the<br />\nPersian Gulf. Hussein's anticipation of a long war is more realistic<br />\nthan the hopes of the United<br />\nStates to end hostilities as quickly as possible, Levy said.<br />\nMaha Damaj, a Lebanese<br />\ncitizen whose parents live in the<br />\nUnited Arab Emirates, said that<br />\nthe Arabs, while out of range of<br />\ncombat and therefore not immediately threatened, fear the effects that the war will have on the<br />\nnation's economy. She feels that<br />\nthe United States generally does<br />\nnot have a right to be fighting in<br />\nthe Middle East. Damaj is comforted by the fact that the United<br />\nStates is aiding in the battle to<br />\nstop Hussein, but she feals that<br />\nmuch more should have been<br />\ndone to find a peaceful solution.<br />\nAnother student from Lebanon,<br />\nwhose parents now work in Saudi<br />\nArabia, also said that he was<br />\ngrateful for the help of the United<br />\nStates and the coalition. Many<br />\nSaudis, however, are against the<br />\nwar and feel that Iraq would not<br />\nhave attacked if they hadn't been<br />\nprovoked by the tremendous<br />\nbuildup of the United States,<br />\nwhich began in August with the<br />\nimplementation of Desert Shield.<br />\nKing Fahd will support the actions of the United States-led<br />\nalliance even though the Saudi<br />\nArabian people are generally<br />\nagainst war.<br />\nWhile Arab-Americans view<br />\nthe current military action of the<br />\ncoalition against Hussein as hasty, they feel that action against<br />\nHussein was necessary. As<br />\nseveral have pointed out, Bush's<br />\ntactics may stop Hussein but the<br />\ntactics do not take into account<br />\nthe turmoil of conflicting loyalties<br />\namong nations in the Middle<br />\nEast, or the long-term success of<br />\nthe aggressive foreign policy of<br />\nthe U.S. in the Middle East.<br /><br />\n16/FEBRUARY 1, 1990<br /><br />\nSpnin 1991<br />\n0.1IP<br /><br />\nThe events in the Faculty/Student Interaction Program are offered free of charge<br />\nfor undergraduates through funding by the Young Alumni Fund and the<br />\nHomewood Deans.

After a<br />\nrocky 3-4 start, the Blue Jays<br />\nhave racked up ten wins in their<br />\nlast twelve games, including victories over league foes Swarthmore and Ursinus last week,<br />\nraising their chances for post<br />\nseason play from nonexistent to<br />\nlikely. The Jays are also sitting<br />\natop the MAC Southeast division<br />\nwith a perfect 6-0 mark.<br />\nSwarthmore came to Baltimore<br />\nlast Saturday sporting a 3-0<br />\nrecord in the division, but the<br />\nJays defended their nest with an<br />\n82-77 wind to assume sole<br />\npossession of first place. Andy<br />\nEinfield, as usual, led the way<br />\nwith 31 points, hitting 11 of 15<br />\nshots including four three<br />\npointers. Enfield had a quiet first<br />\nhalf, scoring just seven points,<br />\nbut the rest of the team hit their<br />\nshots to help Hopkins to a 39-11<br />\nlead at the half. At halftime, the<br />\nGarnets apparently decided that<br />\nin order to win, they would have_ \u2022<br /><br />\nto tighten up their defense on the<br />\nentire Hopkins lineup rather than<br />\nconcentrating on Enfield, then<br />\nhope that the All-American guard<br />\nwould not have his usual touch.<br />\nHe did, however, exploding for<br />\n24 second half points.<br />\nThe Jays defense played well,<br />\nholding the Garnets to 45.6 percent shooting, but were helped<br />\nout by Swarthmore's curious<br />\nstrategy on offense. Despite the<br />\nfact that their burly center, Robert<br />\nRuffin, appeared to be having his<br />\nway with Hopkins' inside<br />\nplayers, Swarthmore's guards<br />\nand forwards continued to fire up<br />\noutside shots.

In just a few<br />\nweeks, major league teams will<br />\ncommence spring training in<br />\nwarmer locales. And, as usual,<br />\nevery team will be showcasing a<br />\ncouple of new faces who will lead<br />\nthem to the World Series.<br />\nWhile the Dodgers, Blue Jays,<br />\nand Giants stole the headlines this<br />\nwinter with blockbuster trades<br />\nand free agent signings, general<br />\nmanager Roland Hemond has<br />\nkept the Orioles active with a few<br />\ntrades of his own.<br />\nFrank Robinson will finally<br />\nhave the homerun threat he has<br />\nbeen begging for the last two<br />\nyears. First baseman Glenn Davis<br />\njoins the Orioles after spending<br />\nhis first five years in the majors<br />\nin Houston. The Astros virtually<br />\ngave Davis to the Orioles because<br />\nhe is eligible for free agency<br />\nfollowing this season. Rather than<br />\nreceive a draft pick from the team<br />\nthat signed him (they wouldn't<br />\npay him enough to keep him), the<br />\nAstros traded for outfielder Steve<br />\nFinley and pitcher Pete Harnisch.<br />\nBaltimore benefits from the<br />\ntrade in many ways. Davis has hit<br />\nover thirty homeruns every<br />\nseason despite playing half his<br />\ngames in the spacious<br />\nAstrodome, a pitcher's paradise.<br />\nWith his power, he should easily<br />\nblast forty homers in the smaller<br />\nAmerican League ballparks. Cal<br />\nRipken should come back from<br />\nseveral 'mediocre' campaigns<br />\nwith the threat of Davis behind<br />\nhim in the batting order.<br />\nThe deal also gives Hemond<br />\nthe option of including David<br />\nSegui or Randy Milligan in a trade<br />\nfor some pitching. The Birds are<br />\ndesperate for quality starting pitching (isn't everybody), especially after dealing Pete Harnisch.<br />\nUnfortunately, Jim Palmer isn't<br />\nthe answer.<br />\nHemond has already attempted<br />\nto improve the starting pitching<br />\nby picking up Jeff Robinson from<br />\nthe Tigers in exchange for<br /><br />\nMickey Tettleton. The deal can't<br />\nhurt the Orioles, as Tettleton will<br />\nnever put up the numbers he did<br />\ntwo years ago. Robinson, of<br />\ncourse, had a phenomenal season<br />\nthree years ago, but blew out his<br />\narm and hasn't yet fully<br />\nrecovered. Last season, Robinson<br />\nwas erratic at best. He did,<br />\nhowever, provide quite a few<br />\nsouvenirs for the Detroit faithful.<br />\nBaltimore's only free agent<br />\nsigning is another risk. Outfielder/DH Dwight Evans brings<br />\nsixteen years of experience (but<br />\nno rings) to the clubhouse. While<br />\nEvans was once the premier<br /><br />\ndefensive rightfielder and one of<br />\nthe most consistent run producers<br />\nin the major leagues, a chronic<br />\nback problem has limited his outfield play the past two seasons.<br />\nHis bat will provide even more<br />\npower to a suddenly potent<br />\nOrioles lineup, but if he is limited<br />\nto DH duty, Evans will<br />\nsimultaneously weaken the lineup<br />\nby forcing the O's to play such<br />\ninferior outfielders as Brady<br />\nAnderson and Donnell Nixon.<br />\nUnfortunately for Birds fans,<br />\nthe Orioles are still a couple of<br />\ntrades away from a division title,<br />\neven in the A.L.(L)East.<br /><br />\nRegroup<br />\nby Ethan Skolnick<br />\nAfter stumbling to three consecutive losses, the Johns<br />\nHopkins men's fencing squad rebounded against Vassar and<br />\nSUNY Purchase with two impressive victories, raising their<br />\noverall record to 9-3.<br />\n\"We went through a slump,<br />\nbut I think we have it straightened out now,\" said foil captain<br />\nRichard Millhiser, a junior who<br />\nhas a 27-19 individual record.<br />\n\"All the weapons look strong<br />\nnow and our only goal is an MAC<br />\nChampionship.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays sport a solid 5-1<br />\nmark in MAC competition thus<br />\nfar.

Okay, truth to tell, I got two entries, but<br />\none of them was News-Letter staff, so it had to be disqualified. (Last time I try to sneak away with the<br />\ngroceries. ..) Anyway, that left only one entrant to Per's<br />\nPink Floyd quiz, Steven \"Yogi\" Jones and Brent \"Boo<br />\nBoo\" Baker. Steven (or Brent, whoever wrote the entry) writes, \"I used to hate Pink Floyd because my<br />\nroommate used to play it all the time to cover the sounds<br />\nthat he and his girlfriend used to make while screwing.<br />\nSoon as he moved out, I started to miss it, so I went<br />\nout and bought my first album.\" Hmm. I would have<br />\njust gone and gotten a girlfriend. Anyway, the answers<br />\nwere (at least, so Per tells me): 1) Six maggot closeups, 2) From his 'little black book', 3) Six guards, 4)<br />\nHe dies at Anzio, in Italy, 5) A Mickey Mouse watch,<br />\n6)4 legs: David Bingham, 3 legs: Bob Geldof, 2 legs:<br />\nKevin McKeon, 7) A rat, and he covered it with his<br />\nsweater, 8) Crossed hammers, 9) Vera Lyn Floyd, 10)<br />\nA vacuum cleaner, 11) Childhood experiences that<br />\nturned him inward; there are three of them, 12) The<br />\nmerry-go-round, 13) Twice, 14) \"laddie\" 15)<br />\n\"airplane\" 16) \"rule again?\" 17) Nigger, 18) Judge,<br />\nSchoolmaster, mother, wife, and Prosecutor, 19) His<br />\nwife, 20) He speaks his performance in the movie, and<br />\nsings it on the album, 21) A pill. Per continues to refuse<br />\nto tell me the true answer to the bonus question, so I<br />\ncontinue to contend that the secret message reads, \"The<br />\nowls are not what they seem.\" So sue me.<br /><br />\n111 OUS 110teS<br />\nSinging Valentinesare being sold for<br />\n$4.00 each and will be delivered<br />\nanywhere on campus on Thursday, Feb.<br />\n14 from 10 am to 9 pm.
