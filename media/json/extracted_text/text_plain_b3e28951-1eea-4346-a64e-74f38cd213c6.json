Let us see if the rest<br />\nof the election for the captains of<br />\nthe lacrosse, baseball and basketball teams was carried out with<br />\nthe same idea. Hardly, for all<br />\nof the captains of the above-mentioned teams are letter men, and<br />\nnot only that, but three out of the<br />\nfour managers elected were also<br />\n'Varsity men who had won the<br />\n\"H.\" The views and actions seem<br />\nhardly to coincide.<br />\nAs to why I have concerned myself with this affair, there are several reasons. First, I believe that<br />\nclass athletics and 'Varsity teams<br />\nare so closely related, and properly, that the interests of the managers of the 'Varsity teams should<br />\nnot be confined exclusively to the<br />\n'Varsity sports. Second, I believe<br />\nthat as a member of the Junior<br />\nClass I have a right to express my<br />\nsentiments, publicly or privately,<br />\nagainst such actions as I personally deem unjustifiable when such<br />\nactions concern more than an individual. Third, in view of the<br />\nfact that there is no justice in allowing the captain of a class team<br />\nto be chosen by the class at large<br />\nany more than having the 'Varsity<br />\ncaptains elected by the student<br />\nvote, I hoped to bring the matter<br />\nto the attention of the Athletic<br />\nBoard, and have the proper relations established.<br />\nV.

THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER should initiate a<br />\ncampaign against this \"promiscuous\" smoking in the academic<br />\nclassrooms and corridors. Several<br />\nmembers of the faculty have indirectly signified that they look<br />\nupon it as highly undesirable.<br />\nThis year is the first time that<br />\nthere has been so much smoking<br />\nabout the buildings to attract the<br />\nattention and critieism of anyone<br />\nof the faculty. It is a poor precedent, and if students are allowed<br />\nto go unchecked, smoking about<br />\nthe buildings will become an objectionable tradition that* will be<br />\nhard to eradicate.<br />\nHOPK I NS ALL OVER.<br />\n<br />\nTeam This Year.<br />\nUntil next fall there will be no<br />\nbasket-ball team playing under the<br />\nname of Hopkins, or even as an independent team.

By keeping an eye on the men who come<br />\nout for this new minor sport, it is<br />\nexpected that in the fall a fast<br />\nteam can quickly be brought together. The prospects for the<br />\ngame are very bright, for if the<br />\nbasket-ball league of the S. A. I.<br />\nA.

Third, in view of the<br />\nfact that there is no justice in allowing the captain of a class team<br />\nto be chosen by the class at large<br />\nany more than having the 'Varsity<br />\ncaptains elected by the student<br />\nvote, I hoped to bring the matter<br />\nto the attention of the Athletic<br />\nBoard, and have the proper relations established.<br />\nV.
