One rowdy student had<br />\nto be thrown out of a dance,<br />\nthe other\u2014if not the same\u2014was<br />\ncaught with liquor in his car.<br />\nDean Morrill asked the Council<br />\nwhether it wanted to have some<br />\nsay in the disciplinary action<br />\ntaken.<br />\nJurisdiction Questioned<br />\nTo the Council it was a problem of jurisdiction. Disciplinary<br />\nmatters, particularly where they<br />\ndo not greatly reflect on the<br />\nschool's reputation, have not, as<br />\na matter of policy, been submitted to the Council before. The<br />\nCouncil was consequently somewhat perplexed as to how to<br />\nhandle the matter.<br />\nIn the end the Council both<br />\n<br />\nresolved to take this particular<br />\ncase into consideration and also<br />\nappointed a committee, headed<br />\nby John Sanborn, to investigate<br />\nwhat the Council should do when<br />\nmatters of discipline reflect on<br />\nHopkins' image.<br />\nCampaign Funds<br />\nRepresentative Bob Feibel proposed that student campaign expenditures be limited.

And thus it has been<br />\nwritten that that day of days<br />\nshall close, and that we shall<br />\nwonder over these mysteries of<br />\nthe Great Pumpkin.<br />\n\"One more thing remains to<br />\nbe acocunted for, since not all<br />\npumpkins rose up into the Great<br />\nPumpkin. And it was for these<br />\npumpkins that the huge noise<br />\nof the portals brought the meaningless terror, brought the anxiety of non-relation, brought<br />\nthe fear of a self that has been<br />\nstripped of its temporal and material relations. For these were<br />\nthe pumpkins whose essential<br />\nnature was unreceptive to the<br />\nForce; these were the pumpkins<br />\nwho when released from their<br />\nweight had no essence save existence, and existence alone<br />\nfeels not the Force. For lo, it<br />\nwas written that every pumpkin<br />\nhas but one summer to live,<br />\nand thus but one summer to<br />\nbecome, for the existence was<br />\n<br />\ngiven, as to a rock, but only<br />\npumpkins were given the opportunity to become more than<br />\nexistence, and this becoming is<br />\na great mystery in every way,<br />\nbut it is enough for a pumpkin<br />\nto know this, as no pumpkin<br />\ncan understand, nor can it hope<br />\nto understand. A pumpkin is able<br />\nto act on and create essential<br />\nnature, and if it does this in any<br />\nway then that essence shall be<br />\nreceptive to the Force. But the<br />\npumpkins left behind are those<br />\nwho never developed an essential nature other than the given<br />\nexistence\u2014these are the pumpkins who sought to exist only in<br />\nrelation to other existing objects<br />\n\u2014never were they essential within themselves. And it was written that these pumpkins would<br />\nsee the day when their existential relations would be stripped<br />\naway, and they must exhibit<br />\nessential characteristics wholly<br />\ndependent on themselves, and<br />\nthese pumpkins knew, as it was<br />\n<br />\nclearly written, that there was<br />\nbut one brief summer for this<br />\nto be done. The pumpkins that<br />\nremain on the earth are now<br />\nwithout weight, and hence they<br />\nhave lost all relation to other<br />\npumpkins.

This particular<br />\ninstance of one of the attributes<br />\nof the Great Pumpkin's essential nature illustrates the way<br />\nin which the Great Pumpkin<br />\npartakes of all the attributes it<br />\ndesires or wills to partake of. yet<br />\nparticipates or partakes of none<br />\nof their imperfections or limitations.<br />\nAnd lo, the day shall come to<br />\npass when the Great Pumpkin<br />\ninvegitate shall appear\u2014a huge<br />\nand wondrous orange sphere<br />\nshall hang in the sky, appearing the same to all observers. And<br />\nno more shall there be talk of<br />\nbelief but rather there will be<br />\nwonder in knowledge; joy in experience. And as the appearance<br />\nof the sun is seen to draw moisture and dew from the ponds<br />\nand meadows, so the presence<br />\nof the Great Pumpkin will cause<br />\nall pumpkins of the earth, past<br />\nand present, to rise up and take<br />\nthe form of their original material existence and lo, the lands<br />\nof the earth will be covered to<br />\na height of nine feet with<br />\npumpkins, and in like manner<br />\nwill the waters of the earth be<br />\ninundated to a depth of nine<br />\nfeet with pumpkins, as has been<br />\nsaid in the Books, 'All the surface of the earth shall be covered with pumpkins: for as far<br />\nas the eye can see shall be seen<br />\npumpkins, and he who does not<br />\n<br />\n1 On Tim<br />\n* I<br />\nLeft<br />\nBy H.

And as the<br />\nPumpkin hangs in the sky there<br />\nshall be heard a great clanking<br />\nand banging and screeching of<br />\nlong unused hinges, and, marvelous to see, great portals shall<br />\nbe viewed to open in the side<br />\nof the Great Pumpkin. And now<br />\nthere will be fear and forboding<br />\nas the great doors are seen to<br />\nswing open, for all know now<br />\nthat it will be as the prophets<br />\nhave said. With the doors at<br />\ntheir apex shall occur a strange<br />\nand wonderous thing, for all the<br />\npumpkins on the surface of the<br />\nearth will become light, like<br />\nbirds, and they will be seen to<br />\nlose all their weight, until finally their essential nature exists<br />\nunburdened, and they are free<br />\nunto themselves. And lo, now<br />\namong them will be felt the<br />\nstirrings of the Force, for the<br />\nselection has long been made.<br />\nLike joyous doves, freed from<br />\nthe doors of the cathedral to<br />\nsoar up above the square, so<br />\nshall the pumpkins which are<br />\nreceptive to the Force be seen<br />\nto rise, and move towards the<br />\nportals of the Great Pumpkin.<br />\nAnd from all over the earth<br />\nshall be seen a wondrous sight,<br />\nfor millions of pumpkins shall<br />\n<br />\ndence<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nPrior to reading the NewsLetter review of this year's<br />\nfreshman play, I had heard<br />\nrumors that the play was indeed<br />\nreviewed in<br />\nabsentia.

Disciplinary<br />\nmatters, particularly where they<br />\ndo not greatly reflect on the<br />\nschool's reputation, have not, as<br />\na matter of policy, been submitted to the Council before. The<br />\nCouncil was consequently somewhat perplexed as to how to<br />\nhandle the matter.<br />\nIn the end the Council both<br /><br />\nresolved to take this particular<br />\ncase into consideration and also<br />\nappointed a committee, headed<br />\nby John Sanborn, to investigate<br />\nwhat the Council should do when<br />\nmatters of discipline reflect on<br />\nHopkins' image.<br />\nCampaign Funds<br />\nRepresentative Bob Feibel proposed that student campaign expenditures be limited.

And thus it has been<br />\nwritten that that day of days<br />\nshall close, and that we shall<br />\nwonder over these mysteries of<br />\nthe Great Pumpkin.<br />\n\"One more thing remains to<br />\nbe acocunted for, since not all<br />\npumpkins rose up into the Great<br />\nPumpkin. And it was for these<br />\npumpkins that the huge noise<br />\nof the portals brought the meaningless terror, brought the anxiety of non-relation, brought<br />\nthe fear of a self that has been<br />\nstripped of its temporal and material relations. For these were<br />\nthe pumpkins whose essential<br />\nnature was unreceptive to the<br />\nForce; these were the pumpkins<br />\nwho when released from their<br />\nweight had no essence save existence, and existence alone<br />\nfeels not the Force. For lo, it<br />\nwas written that every pumpkin<br />\nhas but one summer to live,<br />\nand thus but one summer to<br />\nbecome, for the existence was<br /><br />\ngiven, as to a rock, but only<br />\npumpkins were given the opportunity to become more than<br />\nexistence, and this becoming is<br />\na great mystery in every way,<br />\nbut it is enough for a pumpkin<br />\nto know this, as no pumpkin<br />\ncan understand, nor can it hope<br />\nto understand. A pumpkin is able<br />\nto act on and create essential<br />\nnature, and if it does this in any<br />\nway then that essence shall be<br />\nreceptive to the Force. But the<br />\npumpkins left behind are those<br />\nwho never developed an essential nature other than the given<br />\nexistence\u2014these are the pumpkins who sought to exist only in<br />\nrelation to other existing objects<br />\n\u2014never were they essential within themselves. And it was written that these pumpkins would<br />\nsee the day when their existential relations would be stripped<br />\naway, and they must exhibit<br />\nessential characteristics wholly<br />\ndependent on themselves, and<br />\nthese pumpkins knew, as it was<br /><br />\nclearly written, that there was<br />\nbut one brief summer for this<br />\nto be done. The pumpkins that<br />\nremain on the earth are now<br />\nwithout weight, and hence they<br />\nhave lost all relation to other<br />\npumpkins. Now they have no opportunity to become, and, unrelated to all other entities, they<br />\nwill gradually diffuse and exist<br />\nalone. And it is a peculiarity of<br />\npumpkins that if they have no<br />\napparent essential nature save<br />\nexistence this will be a great<br />\nterror to them, and entail a certain unending anxiety and anguish. This is the fate of the<br />\npumpkins left behind after the<br />\ndeparture of the Great Pumpkin\u2014as to why these pumpkins<br />\nneglected to become during their<br />\nbrief summer is a problem which<br />\nwill not be dealt with at present,<br />\nsuffice it to know that this neglect is related, in no small way,<br />\nto the actions of an entity which<br />\nis commonly referred to as the<br />\nPump Greatkin.<br /><br />\nRECORDS<br />\nMONO and STEREO<br />\n\u2022 CLASSICAL \u2022 FOLK \u2022 POP<br />\n\u2022 SPOKEN \u2022 JAZZ \u2022 IMPORTS<br /><br />\nLargest Selection Anywhere<br />\nDISCOUNT PRICES<br />\nESOTERICA OUR SPECIALTY<br />\nNAT BARNETT'S<br /><br />\nWARWICK<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nHI Fl RECORD SHOP<br />\nFREE PARKI-.G<br /><br />\n2580<br /><br />\nMcCULLOH STREET<br /><br />\nNO. 9-6100<br /><br />\nTailoring Company<br /><br />\nTraditionally Styled<br />\nCustom Hand-Tailored<br />\nSuits and Tuxedos<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\nBAND<br />\nThe Concert Band will<br />\npresent it fall concert at<br />\n8:30 p.m. tonight.

This particular<br />\ninstance of one of the attributes<br />\nof the Great Pumpkin's essential nature illustrates the way<br />\nin which the Great Pumpkin<br />\npartakes of all the attributes it<br />\ndesires or wills to partake of. yet<br />\nparticipates or partakes of none<br />\nof their imperfections or limitations.<br />\nAnd lo, the day shall come to<br />\npass when the Great Pumpkin<br />\ninvegitate shall appear\u2014a huge<br />\nand wondrous orange sphere<br />\nshall hang in the sky, appearing the same to all observers. And<br />\nno more shall there be talk of<br />\nbelief but rather there will be<br />\nwonder in knowledge; joy in experience. And as the appearance<br />\nof the sun is seen to draw moisture and dew from the ponds<br />\nand meadows, so the presence<br />\nof the Great Pumpkin will cause<br />\nall pumpkins of the earth, past<br />\nand present, to rise up and take<br />\nthe form of their original material existence and lo, the lands<br />\nof the earth will be covered to<br />\na height of nine feet with<br />\npumpkins, and in like manner<br />\nwill the waters of the earth be<br />\ninundated to a depth of nine<br />\nfeet with pumpkins, as has been<br />\nsaid in the Books, 'All the surface of the earth shall be covered with pumpkins: for as far<br />\nas the eye can see shall be seen<br />\npumpkins, and he who does not<br /><br />\n1 On Tim<br />\n* I<br />\nLeft<br />\nBy H.

And as the<br />\nPumpkin hangs in the sky there<br />\nshall be heard a great clanking<br />\nand banging and screeching of<br />\nlong unused hinges, and, marvelous to see, great portals shall<br />\nbe viewed to open in the side<br />\nof the Great Pumpkin. And now<br />\nthere will be fear and forboding<br />\nas the great doors are seen to<br />\nswing open, for all know now<br />\nthat it will be as the prophets<br />\nhave said. With the doors at<br />\ntheir apex shall occur a strange<br />\nand wonderous thing, for all the<br />\npumpkins on the surface of the<br />\nearth will become light, like<br />\nbirds, and they will be seen to<br />\nlose all their weight, until finally their essential nature exists<br />\nunburdened, and they are free<br />\nunto themselves. And lo, now<br />\namong them will be felt the<br />\nstirrings of the Force, for the<br />\nselection has long been made.<br />\nLike joyous doves, freed from<br />\nthe doors of the cathedral to<br />\nsoar up above the square, so<br />\nshall the pumpkins which are<br />\nreceptive to the Force be seen<br />\nto rise, and move towards the<br />\nportals of the Great Pumpkin.<br />\nAnd from all over the earth<br />\nshall be seen a wondrous sight,<br />\nfor millions of pumpkins shall<br /><br />\ndence<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nPrior to reading the NewsLetter review of this year's<br />\nfreshman play, I had heard<br />\nrumors that the play was indeed<br />\nreviewed in<br />\nabsentia. After<br />\nfinishing Herskovic's bombast, I<br />\nunderstand how much it must,<br />\nfor your reviewer, have been a<br />\nsomewhat dualist experience:<br />\nthat is, although he was probably present in a physical sense,<br />\nhe had evidently left his intellectual faculties in some very<br />\ndifferent location.<br />\nApart from Mr. Herskovic's<br />\nchildlike cynicism, I am wondering why he never bothered<br />\ncommenting on any of the technical aspects of the production,<br />\nor on the very fine job performed by the cast. I find it hard<br />\nto believe that the News-Letter<br />\nis lacking on its staff someone<br />\nwho knows the mechanics of<br />\ntheatrical review.<br />\nAs for this latest \"critic\", send<br />\nhim back to 11th grade English<br />\nclass.<br />\nHeik Pensel<br /><br />\nbe rising and moving towards<br />\nthose doors, and as far as the<br />\neye can see shall be rising and<br />\nmoving towards those doors, and<br />\nas far as the eyes can see shall<br />\nthere be pumpkins rising and<br />\nentering the doors, and each individual pumpkin will be rotating on its own axis, for when it<br />\nassumes its position in the Great<br />\nPumpkin it will be rotating at<br />\nits inherent and essential speed,<br />\nwhich in itself will indicate the<br />\nproper place for it in relation<br />\nto the other pumpkins. And when<br />\nall the pumpkins which were receptive have risen and taken<br />\ntheir places inside the Great<br />\nPumpkin, then shall there be<br />\nheard the great clanking and<br />\nbanging and screeching of hinges<br />\nonce more, and with a sound<br />\nhuge in its finality shall the<br />\nportals close, till once more the<br />\nGreat Pumpkin is whole\u2014it<br />\nshall hang for an instant in<br />\nthe sky\u2014a wondrous orange<br />\nsphere. And then, in the strange<br />\nsilence that has suddenly fallen<br />\non that day of days, the Great<br />\nPumpkin will suddenly begin to<br />\nrise, but it will be an essential<br />\nrising, not in relation to the<br />\nearth, but in itself it will arise,<br />\ngoing through wondrous convolutions within itself, and the<br />\nnature of these motions is too<br />\nwondrous and complex to be described, for they are of the essential nature of the Great<br />\nPumpkin, whose nature is beyond<br />\nour finite comprehension. But it<br />\nwill pass, that with the progress<br />\nof these convolutions unto itself, the Great Pumpkin shall<br />\nappear smaller and smaller, as<br />\n(Continued on Page 3)<br /><br />\n,<br />\n(Oti041<br />\nitiOt<br />\nBy CHARLES CROWELL<br /><br />\nTwo recent Supreme Court<br />\nIn less than one week America<br />\ndecisions have been a source of<br />\nwill go to the polls and elect a<br />\nconsternation in the conservapresident.
