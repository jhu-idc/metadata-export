Mark<br />\nHertsgaard, leading the forum for<br />\nthe Student Council, opened the<br />\nevening by remarking that a<br />\nfavorable response would lead to<br />\nmore sessions throughout the<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe presentation featured four<br />\nof the more visible members of<br />\nthe Hopkins faculty -- Ric<br />\nPfeffer, Robert Pond. William<br />\nMcClain, and Phoebe Stanton -each of whom delivered a short<br />\ntalk on the murky concepts of<br />\n'university\" and \"education.\"<br />\nPfeffer began by noting that<br />\nHopkins. typical of American<br />\nthree primary<br />\nuniversities.<br />\ngoals: training, bestowing<br />\ncredentials, and indoctrinating,<br />\nthe reinforcement of social habits<br />\nsuch as competition and<br />\nrecognition of authority.<br />\nHe stressed that the university<br />\nShould instead get students to<br />\nthink critically about society. in<br />\n<br />\niNs<br />\n<br />\nl<br />\nh<br />\nTIMi<br />\n<br />\na detached manner to \" generate<br />\nthe. correct questions about our<br />\nlives.\" For specific examples, he<br />\nsuggested that courses (now<br />\nglaringly absent flom university<br />\ncurricula) should be given on the<br />\nidea of the university, the mass<br />\nmedia, and work in society; the<br />\ndevelopment of American<br />\ncapitalism and the Vietnam war<br />\nalso deserve more attention.<br />\nCommenting on the<br />\nfragmented nature of<br />\nundergraduate education, Pfeffer<br />\nSt ated that. most courses are<br />\n\"abstracted from life and,<br />\nbasically bookwork.- Students<br />\nmust pursue tactics in education,<br />\nIle emphasized. which would<br />\nmaximize critical thinking while<br />\nprotecting them politically. He<br />\nclosed by remarking that \"you<br />\nwill become educated at this<br />\nuniversity primarily not because<br />\nof Hopkins, but despite<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nBoth Pond and McClain<br />\nfollowed with more traditional<br />\nviews.- Pond defining education as<br />\nan \"insatiable desire to learn\"<br />\nand the university supposedly<br />\nProviding the necessary tools to<br />\n<br />\nfeed that desire; McClain<br />\nreflecting on the transition Imin<br />\nthe classical outline of education<br />\nto,\u2022\u2022 the Iwo d el-p idea of<br />\n\"generative\" studids (those that<br />\ncan link one to almost any<br />\nsubject).<br />\n\"The real challenge,\" McClain<br />\nsaid, \"in view of the acceleration<br />\n(of our age) is to determine what<br />\nwe can teach and what we can<br />\nomit...there's a conflict between<br />\nstudents who know what they<br />\nhave to do. and we who know<br />\nwhat we have to teach<br />\nWe're In the Money<br />\nFinally, Stanton ventured that<br />\n\"I think you're here for these<br />\n, four years because you can<br />\nafford it,\" drawing the second<br />\nlargest laugh of the evening.<br />\n\"You're waiting out an extended<br />\nadolescence here,'' she<br />\ncommented.<br />\nOn a more positive note, she<br />\nemphasized that pleasure should<br />\nbe a part of education -- \"I want<br />\nyou to enjoy knowing things.\"<br />\nShe complained, however. that<br />\nmuch of the faculty \"does not<br />\nthink very well on issues outside<br />\nof their own credentialed area.-<br />\n<br />\nWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nlxxxi no. 21/Ittes(laN, nowinlx.i. 16, 1976/-halliiiiore, 111411A lan(I/ 81st<br />\n<br />\nVal*<br />\n<br />\nIntersession provision requested<br />\nBy GEORGE B. ZELINSKY<br />\nA resolution urging the<br />\nAcademic Council to in<br />\nthe provision, by each academic<br />\ndepartment, of a specified<br />\nminimmn number of Intersession<br />\ncourses, will be brought before<br />\nthe Student Council tonight.<br />\nSenior Class President Sheldm<br />\nHimelfarb, who, along with<br />\nStudent Assistant to the Dean<br />\nAndy Davis, is co-sponsoring the<br />\nresolution, asserted that \"the<br />\nobjectives and structure of the<br />\nIntersession must be changed in<br />\nOrder for it to be viable.\"<br />\nThe Himelfarb/Davis<br />\nresolution calls for a student<br />\nreferendum to decide the fate of<br />\nlntersession. The options to be<br />\nput before the student body are:<br />\nI.) upgrading the Intersession to<br />\nthe level where it is acceptable to<br />\nboth students and faculty; 2.)<br />\nmaintain the current system; or<br />\n3-) return to the pre-Intersession<br />\nSystem of exams in January.<br />\nAccording to Himelfarb,<br />\ndepartments would be given a<br />\nSpecific number (scaled according<br />\nto t he size of the given<br />\ndepartment) of courses which<br />\nthey must make available for the<br />\nIntersession period. Based on the<br />\nassumption that increased course<br />\nOfferings will result in greater<br />\nstudent participation, the<br />\nresolution does not provide any<br />\nguarantees of increased student<br />\ninterest. Himelfarb admitted that<br />\na mandatory mini-semester had<br />\nbeen discussed, but that \"this<br />\nwould have gone against the<br />\noriginal purpose and spirit of the<br />\n<br />\nIii order to<br />\nIntersession.<br />\nPreclude the possibility of<br />\ninstructors lecturing to empty<br />\nclassrooms (at least for the first<br />\nfew days) the resolution would<br />\nalso prescribe enrollment<br />\nminimums. Himel farb expressed<br />\nconfidence that increased course<br />\nselection would raise student<br />\ninterest.<br />\nThe Inter session originally<br />\nevolved in 1969 from student<br />\ndemands for calendar reform. At<br />\nthat time. Hopkins was operating<br />\nunder a semester system, with<br />\nexams in mid-Janiary, preceded<br />\nby a two week \"reading period.\"<br />\nStudents and faculty argued that<br />\nthe reading period was a \"dead<br />\nspace\" in the school's calendar\u2014a<br />\nnine which they claimed could<br />\nbe used for \"an informal<br />\nexchange of knowledge\" between<br />\nprofessors and students,<br />\nunrestricted by considerations of<br />\ngrades or credits. The SC, after<br />\nthreatening a student strike, held<br />\na referendum on the \"4-1-4\" plan<br />\n(four months\u2014 one month--...).<br />\nIn what may well have been a<br />\nforecast of things to come, only<br />\n40 per cent of the 1890 member<br />\nstudent body voted on the<br />\nproposal, which was carried by<br />\nan overwhelming 94.8 per cent.<br />\nThree days later on March 14,<br />\n1969, the General Assembly of<br />\nthe faculty voted 86-26 in favor<br />\nof Intersession. Finally, on March<br />\n26th, the Academic Council<br />\nratified the plan, with only minor<br />\nmodifications. A key<br />\nconsideration in the<br />\nAdministration's approval was<br />\n<br />\nthe plan's congruence to the then<br />\ncurrent Goucher College<br />\ncalendar; it facilitated<br />\ncooperation between the two<br />\nschools. -After the novelty of the<br />\nsystem began to tarnish, student<br />\ninterest began to taper off, and<br />\nthis, in combination with latent<br />\nopposition, resulted in<br />\nthe<br />\nwidespread disenchantment with<br />\nIntersession. The introduction of<br />\ncredits, in an effort to stimulate<br />\nstudent interest and<br />\nparticipation, met with short<br />\nterm success, and low enrollment<br />\nlevels soon reappeared.<br />\nA highly-placed University<br />\nadministrator labeled the<br />\nIntersession a \"patent failure\",<br />\nwhich should be abolished. The<br />\nsource argued that unless more<br />\nthan 50 per cent of the students<br />\nand faculty participate there<br />\nwould be no point in continuing<br />\nthe Intersession.<br />\nGroveled<br />\nHimelfarb indicated that the<br />\n\"whole purpose of the proposal<br />\nis to put the onus on faculty and<br />\nstudents for the success or failure<br />\nof In te rsession...to bring the<br />\nmatter to a head.\"<br />\nStudent Council President<br />\nSteve Ponchak concurred with<br />\nHimel fa rb's call for assertive<br />\naction. He noted that the passive<br />\napproach taken by past Student<br />\nCouncils has been less than<br />\nsuccessful. \"We've begged and<br />\nbegged\u2014we've groveled\u2014and<br />\nthat's not the road we should<br />\nhave to take for our education<br />\nhere.\"<br />\n<br />\n! Pfeffer, Stanton,McClain. Pond<br />\n<br />\nAfter the individual speeches,<br />\nthe forum continued in the Glass<br />\nPavilion, where a number of<br />\nstudents spilled out tales of<br />\nidentity crises and epiphanies<br />\nabout educational \"reality.\" A<br />\nprevailing view of \"you're here<br />\nfor certification\" came out<br />\nduring the open discussion, with<br />\nthe feeling that 3500 (3700 next<br />\nyear) bills wete perhaps being<br />\ntossed into an irrelevant sinkhole.<br />\nAs for undergraduate - faculty<br />\nrelations, Pfeffer commneted<br />\nthat \"professors are conditioned<br />\nnot to spend too much time with<br />\nstudents...this university is here<br />\nto do research; if you don't<br />\nspend enough time writing five<br />\n<br />\npounds of books, you don't gel<br />\npromoted, regardless of what<br />\nkind of teacher you are.<br />\nEverybody on the faculty knows<br />\nThe relatively large turnout<br />\nand genuine concern about the<br />\nuniversity's problems signaled a<br />\nsuccessful continuation of the<br />\nseries.

The study shows that<br />\n75 percent of all grades issued in<br />\nthe 1975 academic year were<br />\neither \"A's\" or \"B's\".<br />\n\"I don't view the grade<br />\ninflation as an infusion of higher<br />\nintellects. Students aren't better<br />\nthan those in the 1960's,\" said<br />\nSigmund R. Suskind, Dean of<br />\nAcademic Programs. Ile listed the<br />\n<br />\nreasons for the grade inflation as<br />\nfollows:<br />\nIncreased leniency by professors<br />\nin asshming grades.<br />\nCalculated use by students of the<br />\npass/ fail option lot difikult<br />\nclasses outside their major.<br />\nWidespread use by students of<br />\nincompletes to extend their time<br />\nto achieve good grades.<br />\nEm lessors have also been more<br />\nwilling to offer this extra time.<br />\nThe add/drop option which<br />\nallows students to choose at a<br />\nlate date which courses are<br />\neasiest.<br />\nIncreased availabilities of<br />\nstudy<br />\ninternships. in<br />\ncourses. and intersession classes<br />\nwhich normally are liberal on<br />\ngrade decisions.<br />\nOther sources pointed to<br />\ngreater delegation of time by<br />\nstudents to study, the ability of<br />\nstudents to bettel anticipate and<br />\nprepare for exam questions, and<br />\ncheating.<br />\nSup porting the theory of<br />\nerudite study, Frederik Dierman,<br />\nDirector of Academic<br />\nCounseling, said students study<br />\nmore because of the tight job<br />\nmarket, particularly those<br />\nundergraduates who are<br />\npre-meds. \"Students realize that<br />\ntranscripts may be worth<br />\nsomething,\" Ile said.<br />\nSuskind said the<br />\nuse of the pass/fail option will<br />\nprobably decrease now because<br />\ngraduate schools do not accept<br />\ngrades of this sort.<br />\nBoth Suskind and Dierman<br />\npredict a deflationary trend to<br />\nestablish itself in the next ten<br />\nyears. The drop from a 3.14 to<br />\n3.13 CPA may support this<br />\nassertion.<br />\nAsked whether professors have<br />\nbeen instructed to be more strict<br />\nin appraising students, Suskind<br />\nsaid no. \"They have been asked<br />\nto grade as they've always<br />\ngraded; honestly and unbiased.\u2014<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/,iews-letter/dovember 16, 1976<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nwill be including poetry, a new<br />\nfeature, in its Friday editions\u2014if I can<br />\nget campus poets to submit their<br />\npoems.

Mark<br />\nHertsgaard, leading the forum for<br />\nthe Student Council, opened the<br />\nevening by remarking that a<br />\nfavorable response would lead to<br />\nmore sessions throughout the<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe presentation featured four<br />\nof the more visible members of<br />\nthe Hopkins faculty -- Ric<br />\nPfeffer, Robert Pond. William<br />\nMcClain, and Phoebe Stanton -each of whom delivered a short<br />\ntalk on the murky concepts of<br />\n'university\" and \"education.\"<br />\nPfeffer began by noting that<br />\nHopkins. typical of American<br />\nthree primary<br />\nuniversities.<br />\ngoals: training, bestowing<br />\ncredentials, and indoctrinating,<br />\nthe reinforcement of social habits<br />\nsuch as competition and<br />\nrecognition of authority.<br />\nHe stressed that the university<br />\nShould instead get students to<br />\nthink critically about society. in<br /><br />\niNs<br /><br />\nl<br />\nh<br />\nTIMi<br /><br />\na detached manner to \" generate<br />\nthe. correct questions about our<br />\nlives.\" For specific examples, he<br />\nsuggested that courses (now<br />\nglaringly absent flom university<br />\ncurricula) should be given on the<br />\nidea of the university, the mass<br />\nmedia, and work in society; the<br />\ndevelopment of American<br />\ncapitalism and the Vietnam war<br />\nalso deserve more attention.<br />\nCommenting on the<br />\nfragmented nature of<br />\nundergraduate education, Pfeffer<br />\nSt ated that. most courses are<br />\n\"abstracted from life and,<br />\nbasically bookwork.- Students<br />\nmust pursue tactics in education,<br />\nIle emphasized. which would<br />\nmaximize critical thinking while<br />\nprotecting them politically. He<br />\nclosed by remarking that \"you<br />\nwill become educated at this<br />\nuniversity primarily not because<br />\nof Hopkins, but despite<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nBoth Pond and McClain<br />\nfollowed with more traditional<br />\nviews.- Pond defining education as<br />\nan \"insatiable desire to learn\"<br />\nand the university supposedly<br />\nProviding the necessary tools to<br /><br />\nfeed that desire; McClain<br />\nreflecting on the transition Imin<br />\nthe classical outline of education<br />\nto,\u2022\u2022 the Iwo d el-p idea of<br />\n\"generative\" studids (those that<br />\ncan link one to almost any<br />\nsubject).<br />\n\"The real challenge,\" McClain<br />\nsaid, \"in view of the acceleration<br />\n(of our age) is to determine what<br />\nwe can teach and what we can<br />\nomit...there's a conflict between<br />\nstudents who know what they<br />\nhave to do. and we who know<br />\nwhat we have to teach<br />\nWe're In the Money<br />\nFinally, Stanton ventured that<br />\n\"I think you're here for these<br />\n, four years because you can<br />\nafford it,\" drawing the second<br />\nlargest laugh of the evening.<br />\n\"You're waiting out an extended<br />\nadolescence here,'' she<br />\ncommented.<br />\nOn a more positive note, she<br />\nemphasized that pleasure should<br />\nbe a part of education -- \"I want<br />\nyou to enjoy knowing things.\"<br />\nShe complained, however. that<br />\nmuch of the faculty \"does not<br />\nthink very well on issues outside<br />\nof their own credentialed area.-<br /><br />\nWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nlxxxi no. 21/Ittes(laN, nowinlx.i. 16, 1976/-halliiiiore, 111411A lan(I/ 81st<br /><br />\nVal*<br /><br />\nIntersession provision requested<br />\nBy GEORGE B.

The options to be<br />\nput before the student body are:<br />\nI.) upgrading the Intersession to<br />\nthe level where it is acceptable to<br />\nboth students and faculty; 2.)<br />\nmaintain the current system; or<br />\n3-) return to the pre-Intersession<br />\nSystem of exams in January.<br />\nAccording to Himelfarb,<br />\ndepartments would be given a<br />\nSpecific number (scaled according<br />\nto t he size of the given<br />\ndepartment) of courses which<br />\nthey must make available for the<br />\nIntersession period. Based on the<br />\nassumption that increased course<br />\nOfferings will result in greater<br />\nstudent participation, the<br />\nresolution does not provide any<br />\nguarantees of increased student<br />\ninterest. Himelfarb admitted that<br />\na mandatory mini-semester had<br />\nbeen discussed, but that \"this<br />\nwould have gone against the<br />\noriginal purpose and spirit of the<br /><br />\nIii order to<br />\nIntersession.<br />\nPreclude the possibility of<br />\ninstructors lecturing to empty<br />\nclassrooms (at least for the first<br />\nfew days) the resolution would<br />\nalso prescribe enrollment<br />\nminimums.

At<br />\nthat time. Hopkins was operating<br />\nunder a semester system, with<br />\nexams in mid-Janiary, preceded<br />\nby a two week \"reading period.\"<br />\nStudents and faculty argued that<br />\nthe reading period was a \"dead<br />\nspace\" in the school's calendar\u2014a<br />\nnine which they claimed could<br />\nbe used for \"an informal<br />\nexchange of knowledge\" between<br />\nprofessors and students,<br />\nunrestricted by considerations of<br />\ngrades or credits. The SC, after<br />\nthreatening a student strike, held<br />\na referendum on the \"4-1-4\" plan<br />\n(four months\u2014 one month--...).<br />\nIn what may well have been a<br />\nforecast of things to come, only<br />\n40 per cent of the 1890 member<br />\nstudent body voted on the<br />\nproposal, which was carried by<br />\nan overwhelming 94.8 per cent.<br />\nThree days later on March 14,<br />\n1969, the General Assembly of<br />\nthe faculty voted 86-26 in favor<br />\nof Intersession. Finally, on March<br />\n26th, the Academic Council<br />\nratified the plan, with only minor<br />\nmodifications. A key<br />\nconsideration in the<br />\nAdministration's approval was<br /><br />\nthe plan's congruence to the then<br />\ncurrent Goucher College<br />\ncalendar; it facilitated<br />\ncooperation between the two<br />\nschools. -After the novelty of the<br />\nsystem began to tarnish, student<br />\ninterest began to taper off, and<br />\nthis, in combination with latent<br />\nopposition, resulted in<br />\nthe<br />\nwidespread disenchantment with<br />\nIntersession. The introduction of<br />\ncredits, in an effort to stimulate<br />\nstudent interest and<br />\nparticipation, met with short<br />\nterm success, and low enrollment<br />\nlevels soon reappeared.<br />\nA highly-placed University<br />\nadministrator labeled the<br />\nIntersession a \"patent failure\",<br />\nwhich should be abolished.

He noted that the passive<br />\napproach taken by past Student<br />\nCouncils has been less than<br />\nsuccessful. \"We've begged and<br />\nbegged\u2014we've groveled\u2014and<br />\nthat's not the road we should<br />\nhave to take for our education<br />\nhere.\"<br /><br />\n!

We hope<br />\nthat these feelings are shared by<br />\nothers in the university.<br />\nWednesday night's meeting is an<br />\nopportunity to express, share and<br />\nact on those feelings.<br />\nSusan Lynch<br />\nMartha McGloin<br />\nMarie Nally<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI wish to point out a minor<br />\nmisrepresentation on the part of<br />\nMr. Camerer. I am referring to<br />\nthe \"Can uch\" quote, which<br />\nshould not have read, \"Can a<br />\nCanuck fuck?\" but rather, `\u2018Can<br />\na Canuck fuck a duck?\"<br />\nThe first question is merely<br />\nrhetorical, as any one familiar<br />\nwith Cornell's hockey team (the<br />\n\"Cornell Canadiens\") would<br />\nknow. If one were to stand down<br />\nby Lynah rink and shout,\"Can a<br />\nCanuck fuck?'' the<br />\nknuckle -dragging puck-pushers<br />\nwould quickly remove all doubt<br />\nby fucking any nearby objects<br />\nnot nailed to the ground (,eh?)<br />\nHowever, no one has ever<br />\nobserved a Canuck to fuck a<br />\nweb-footed waterfowl (chickens,<br />\nmaybe). The Cornell State<br />\nSchool of Agriculture is currently<br />\nresearching the feasibility of<br />\ncrossing Canucks with ducks in<br />\nhopes of producing 1.) Ducks<br />\nwith skates who don't have to fly<br />\nsouth for the winter; or, 2.).<br />\nWeb-toed hockey players who<br />\nwon't drown if they fall through<br />\nthe ice.<br />\n\"Sandy\"&amp; Co.<br /><br />\nto dirty-mouthed, little boys,<br />\ndon't we, my lovely darlin'?\"<br />\nasks the Mother.<br />\n\"Yesy, they get their widdlers<br />\ncut off and fed to the puppy<br />\nMuffin,\" responds the child.<br />\n\"Ups-the-daisy everyone,<br />\nToday is Sabbath and we all have<br />\nto dress for church.\"<br />\nFelly is sent from the room.<br />\nand Herb and Maisy arise to<br />\nattire themselves for their day of<br />\nrest. Maisie, disrobing her<br />\nmau-mati.floats to the bathroom<br />\nand. closing her eyes as not to see<br />\nherself naked. slips stoically into<br />\na cold shower. Meanwhile,<br />\nIlerbert cautiously cleans up the<br />\nhorrid mess that the 140 pound<br />\npup has cast ovuk, the precious<br />\nheirloom and seals it in a brown<br />\npatler vs/ vappet Rettuxtiug to tbe<br /><br />\nchurch dress (the color of the<br />\nsun. glaring).<br />\n\"Herbert.\" she groans, \"how.<br />\ndare you use the lord's name in<br />\nvain.\" Awfully angrily, she nags.<br />\n\"Now, drop the dog do-do down<br />\nthe commode and get ready for<br />\nservices.\"'<br />\nHerbert smells the yummy<br />\nbath powder that Maisie had<br />\nsifted over her body; he barely<br />\ndiscerns the chalky white remains<br />\nof dust that have mixed with the<br />\nmoisture and stick to the base of<br />\nher neck. He can even pick up<br />\nthe perfume above the pu of the<br />\nsoiled paper sack.<br />\nMaisie's glare intensifies.<br />\n\"Well, Herbert Kuddles, don't<br />\n'lust stand motionless like a<br />\n- mindless worm.

Tears<br />\nsilently cross Herbert's face (the<br />\nfine taste of salt), color arises in<br />\nhis neck, and his soft pattering at<br />\nthe door becomes a forlorn<br />\nclawing. \"Maisie, please let me in<br />\nGod-diddly-damn it.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe door huffs open,exposing<br />\nthe wife in her bright yellow<br /><br />\neyes; he imagines the poo-poo<br />\nslapped across.
