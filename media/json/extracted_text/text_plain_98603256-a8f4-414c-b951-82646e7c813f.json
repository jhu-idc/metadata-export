The floor was in first-class condition, the music was furnished by a good<br />\norchestra, the decorations tasteful, and the<br />\nsupper well appointed and served with more<br />\nexpedience than usual.<br />\nFrom the large number of couples on the<br />\nfloor, it is evident that the dances are growing in popularity, and it is pleasing to note<br />\nthe marked increase in the number of patronesses.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nYet, as praise seldom goes without further<br />\nadvice, we would like to suggest a change<br />\nin the dance programmes. From opinions<br />\nexpressed during the evening, it would seem<br />\nthat the style of programmes used this seaion are not as popular as the style in vogue<br />\nat the dances last year. The narrow Black<br />\nand Blue stripes on the cover of the programmes do not show up as well as the<br />\nbroader bands, and it is an open question as<br />\nto whether the Hopkins shield does not make<br />\na neater appearance on the front of the card<br />\nthan the large script writing.<br />\nOnly one other suggestion, and that is that<br />\ncoffee\u2014good bracing coffee\u2014be served after<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nthe ices. Dancing is a delightful pastime,<br />\nbut after eight solid numbers, a cup of coffee<br />\nmakes it much easier to get through the<br />\nother eight dances.<br />\nT last the arrangements for a Hopkins<br />\nnight at the theatre have been completed. This Saturday evening, the<br />\nmajority of Hopkins supporters will go in a<br />\nbody to see \"The Pearl and the Pumpkin\"<br />\nat the Academy of Music. Upon the success<br />\nof this revival of the custom of having Hopkins nights at the theatre depends whether<br />\nor not these entertainments be again brought<br />\ninto vogue, so it is to be sincerely hoped the<br />\npresent arrangements will be adequate in<br />\nevery particular. However, we have every<br />\nreason to believe that this will be the case,<br />\nand the present outlook is most promising<br />\ntoward the enjoyment of a very agreeable<br />\nevening. The \"Hopkins theatre night\" is<br />\na good custom, and everything seems to<br />\npoint toward the permanent revival of one<br />\nof the most pleasant features in the University's social life.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nERHAPS the only feature of the football season which the Hopkins has<br />\ncause to regret, is the outcome of the<br />\nSt. John's game. But there is an incident<br />\nconnected with that game which ought to<br />\nbe of sincere congratulation to all those who<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nhave the best interests of the University at<br />\nheart.<br />\nAll who were present at the contest know<br />\nhow unexpected and galling was our defeat,<br />\nand in the excitement of the moment, to<br />\nmany Hopkins supporters it seemed almost<br />\ninexcusable that a team which had come so<br />\nsuccessfully through so long a season should<br />\nat the critical moment fall victims to the dash<br />\nand to the strategy of a doubtful rival. Yet<br />\nnever for an instant did our rooters lose<br />\nheart or fail to support the eleven with utmost vigor. And after the game was over,<br />\nand this is the incident to which we would<br />\nespecially call attention, they gathered round<br />\nthe Hopkins team and cheered it with more<br />\nenthusiasm and to greater length than if it<br />\nhad come off victorious.<br />\nWe believe we<br />\nhave seldom seen such an outburst of Hopkins spirit, and it gives much promise that<br />\nthe new era in Hopkins good-fellowship has<br />\ncome to stay.<br />\n<br />\nswer received on account of it coming from<br />\na college which has won the football championship of 1905, was from Yale. As the<br />\nletter to our mind covers the matter in<br />\nquestion better than anything we have seen,<br />\nwe take the liberty of printing it in full.<br />\nJohns Hopkins N4ws-LzTTnR,<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nDear Sirs:\u2014<br />\nIn reply to the questions contained in<br />\nyour letter of Nov. 21st, I would say that<br />\nin answer to the first question, it seems to<br />\nme that there will probably be some few<br />\nchanges in football rules before the beginning of another season, but I do not look<br />\nfor any radical changes. It is barely possible that the officials may be given a wider<br />\nrange of authority in order to prevent unfair play.<br />\nIn answer to question No. 2, I would say<br />\nthat this college would very firmly support<br />\nsuch a movement.<br />\nIn reply to question No. 3, I do not, personally, believe that football as it is now<br />\nN another part of this issue may be found played is having, generally speaking, a harman article discussing the agitation which ful effect upon college athletics or upon the<br />\nhas lately been raised over the objec- players individually.<br />\ntionable features of football.

Will your college take any steps<br />\njust been issued, one can not help being<br />\ntoward making such changes? 3. Do you struck by the small number of students in<br />\nbelieve football, as it is now played, is harm- the Classical Department as compared with<br />\nful either to the best interests of college the large number following the Chemical and<br />\nathletics or of the players themselves?<br />\nPhysical Sciences. Twenty years ago, and<br />\nAlthough some of the managers corres- even less, in the days of the old Classical<br />\nponded with, notably Harvard, Columbia, Course, Latin and Greek were deemed withand Cornell, declined to answer the ques- out doubt absolutely essential to a satisfactions directly on account of lack of specific tory college education. Now, not only are<br />\nknowledge, nevertheless their replies seemed these studies not compulsory, but they are<br />\nto infer that they did not believe the present scarcely encouraged. Whether the new sysuproar about modifying the game would re- tem or the old is theoretically better it is<br />\nsult in any startling changes. From Dart- difficult to say; indeed ,we think that very<br />\nmouth we received a negative answer to the few authorities would care to give a definite<br />\nfirst two questions, and to the third a reply opinion. But one thing is clear. The men<br />\nthat although there were doubtless certain who are turned out of college to-day are just<br />\nabuses which should be eradicated, yet on as efficient and just as happy as those who<br />\nthe whole that football was commendable grew up under the old system. Taking this<br />\nsport. However, the most interesting an- fact into consideration along with the prac-<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntical tendency of the times, there can be but<br />\nlittle doubt of the value of a thorough training in the sciences. Nevertheless, one can<br />\nnot but ask whether eventually this falling<br />\noff in the Classical Departments will not<br />\nweaken an important branch of the intellectual strength of the university.<br />\nT is extremely interesting to note in the<br />\ncurrent issue of the \"Literary Digest,\"<br />\na spirited approval of Mr. James Speyer's endowment of a \"Theodore Roosevelt<br />\nProfessorship\" in the University of Berlin,<br />\nin which the opinions of Presidents Butler<br />\nof Columbia and Eliot of Harvard are aired,<br />\ntogether with editorial extracts from the<br />\nNew York \"Times\" and \"Evening Post.\"<br />\nThe \"Literary Digest,\" despite its reputation for acquaintance with the first words of<br />\nevery national or inter-national discussion,<br />\napparently overlooked the fact that Dr. William Osler, formerly of this University, was<br />\nprobably the first American professor to express his approval of an interchange of European and American teachers. Dr. Osler<br />\nexpressed himself very strongly on this point<br />\nin the same speech in which he advocated an<br />\nage limit for active professors.<br />\nRegarding the gift of Mr. Speyer, the<br />\n\"Literary Digest\" quotes President Butler<br />\nas saying, that by the endowment of the<br />\nnew professorship, a way is opened for the<br />\n\"careful, systematic, and scientific presentation of the culture of one people to the students of another.\" This is but the echo of<br />\nwhat Dr. Osler remarked in his speech given<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nin McCoy Hall on February 22, 1905. \"The<br />\n\"Literary Digest\" would be losing nothing,<br />\nif time was taken to look up Dr. Osler's<br />\nspeech, and pains were taken to learn more<br />\nof it than the mere subsidiary allusions to<br />\nthe \"chloroform method.\"<br />\nApropos the editorial quoted by the \"Literary Digest\" from the New York \"Times,\"<br />\nthe NEw-Ltrra desires to put in an humble<br />\nword. The \"Times\" says: \"There will follow, as day follows dawn, a like system (of<br />\ninter-change of professors), first in other<br />\nGerman and American universities, and then<br />\nin those of France, of England, and\u2014who<br />\nknows?\u2014of Russia.\"<br />\nThe \"Times\" seems to regard the establishmentof such a system with regard to Russia, with an indulgence born of contempt.<br />\nBut we would suggest that from an economic<br />\nstandpoint, possibly more good would come<br />\nfrom the endowment of a Russian chair in<br />\none of the American universities than would<br />\ncome from an inter-change with any one of<br />\nthe first named countries. Our reason for<br />\nmaking this conjecture in the teeth of such<br />\na respected editorial column as maintained<br />\nby the \"Times,\" is this: Russia, as a nation,<br />\nis passing through an economic stage,<br />\nthrough which England passed centuries ago,<br />\nand through which this country has never<br />\npassed. Of this stage our economists know<br />\nat most but little. Would it not be as material an advantage to have the conditions of<br />\nserfdom, as demonstrated in Modern Russia<br />\ntaught us by men who have lived in actual<br />\ntouch with such conditions, as would be the<br />\npresentation to us of European culture?<br />\n<br />\nThe Song of Calypso.<br />\nAwake, awake, Ulysses, wake,<br />\nThe dawn of day is drawing nigh;<br />\nAwake, arise, 0 Greek, arise,<br />\nAurora tints the Eastern sky<br />\nAwake, awake, Ulysses, wake,<br />\nNo longer slumber by the sea;<br />\nAwake, arise, 0 Greek, arise,<br />\nThy loved Calypso calleth thee<br />\n'07.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE 'VARSITY FOOTBALL SEASON.<br />\nThe Hopkins football season, which was<br />\nbrought to a close by the University of Maryland game on Thanksgiving Day, has been<br />\nmost successful. Beginning the autumn by<br />\ndefeating Delaware College 11 to 0, it managed to come out at the finish with but one<br />\ndefeat. Undoubtedly the two contests in<br />\nwhich the Black and Blue showed themselves<br />\nmost strong was in the Mt. Washington game<br />\non Nov. 4, and in the Haverford game a week<br />\nlater. In the Baltimore Medical College<br />\ngame the eleven was not forced to show its<br />\nbest form, and the consequent slump ended<br />\nin the St. John's game, when the team was<br />\nbadly rattled by the unexpected tactics of<br />\nthe cadets. However, in the last contest, the<br />\nteam regained its form and the result of the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland contest was never in<br />\ndoubt from the first kick-off.<br />\nThe team as a whole contained many of<br />\nlast year's men, but new additions made<br />\nit superior to last year's eleven. However,<br />\nsome losses were keenly felt, and it was unfortunate that Randall was only able to play<br />\nin one game. Among the backs, Magoffin<br />\nplayed especially good ball, and his injury<br />\nin the St. John's game may have had something to do with the team's defeat. Captain<br />\nWorthington proved also an excellent ground<br />\ngainer, and could almost invariably be relied upon to push the ball forward. However, on the defense, he was not as strong<br />\nas might be expected.<br />\nHart, Webb and<br />\nCampbell all played good ball, and the latter, toward the end, of the season, showed<br />\nhimself to be a very valuable addition to<br />\nthe speed of the team.<br />\nAt quarter back, Iglehart and Brotherhood both suffered from lack of weight.<br />\nIglehart showed good judgment in running<br />\n<br />\nthe plays, and by his sure open-field tackling<br />\nsaved many a score. He also could run with<br />\nthe ball. Brotherhood, however, managed<br />\nto get more snap in the team, and otherwise<br />\nplayed well.<br />\nOf the ends, Stewart, Estes and MacSherry<br />\nwere good, and though the latter was inclined to be erratic, yet his brilliancy more<br />\nthan made up for it. In the line, Michael<br />\nwas the undoubted star, and shone especially<br />\nwell on the defense. His kicking (as, by<br />\nthe way, was Campbell's work along this<br />\nline), was excellent. The rest of the line<br />\nplayed well and hard, though sometimes not<br />\nreceiving proper support from the backs.<br />\nThe team, as is usual with IIopkins football elevens, suffered somewhat from lack of<br />\npractice, and also from the fact that the men<br />\ndid not train. The latter condition we do<br />\nnot believe is so much a matter of necessity<br />\non account of Hopkins peculiar position as<br />\nsome think it to be, and we believe that<br />\nmuch improvement could be made in that<br />\ndirection.<br />\nManager Shackleford showed<br />\nhimself to be most efficient, and the schedule<br />\narranged was excellent. Next year, however, even better teams will be played. Coach<br />\nIseman has also done yeoman work in his<br />\nespecial department, and the success of the<br />\nteam is in no small measure due to him.<br />\nFinancially, we are also glad to say that<br />\nthe eleven met with excellent support, and<br />\nin the \"rooting\" line, cheer leader Griswold<br />\nand his cohorts produced the best results<br />\nwhich have ever been obtained at the University.<br />\nThe prospects for next year's team are<br />\nmore than bright, and these, together with<br />\nthe present season, are a source of much<br />\ngratification to all admirers of the Black and<br />\nBlue.<br />\n<br />\nLITTLE WILLIE.<br />\nWillie was a little hero,<br />\nPlayed upon his football team.<br />\nWhen they brought back home the pieces,<br />\nOught to heard his mother scream!<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nAt the Hopkins Dance.<br />\nI've sung oft of Dolly,<br />\nAnd often of Bess,<br />\nMade verses for Polly,<br />\nAnd sonnets for Tess;<br />\nBut at last now I leave them,<br />\nTo sing of one higher,<br />\nOutshining all others:<br />\nMy pretty Maria.<br />\n<br />\nThough we started out hunting,<br />\nWe met no success.<br />\n\"Love surely has vanished,\"<br />\nShe had to confess;<br />\nAt last I suggested,<br />\n\"It seems to me clear,<br />\nThat we never will find him<br />\nWith so many here.\"<br />\n<br />\nJust the reason I think so,<br />\nI'll haste to explain,<br />\nLest the reader conclude that<br />\nMy choice it be vain;<br />\n'But no trouble should hinder<br />\nTo guess at a glance,<br />\nThat I lost head and heart<br />\nAt the last Hopkins dance.<br />\n<br />\n\"In fact,\" then I added,<br />\n\"A far quicker way,<br />\nWould be for a moment,<br />\nOur wand'rings to stay;<br />\nAnd some cozy corner<br />\nWill furnish, no doubt,<br />\nA place whither 'Love'<br />\nCan soon find us out.\"<br />\n<br />\nYou see it was this way\u2014<br />\nWe met in the hall,<br />\nAnd chatted a moment<br />\n'Bout nothing at all,<br />\nTill I asked for her partner,<br />\nWhen scarcely above<br />\nA whisper, she answered,<br />\n\"His name it is 'Love.'\"<br />\n<br />\nThe rest of this story,<br />\nI'd better pass o'er,<br />\nThough of course might be said<br />\nA word or two more\u2014<br />\nHow though \"Love\" didn't find us,<br />\nE'en searching his glances,<br />\nYet I think we found \"Love\"<br />\nFor ten or twelve dances<br />\n<br />\n\"You're joking,\" I cried out,<br />\nA bit on my guard.<br />\n\"Well then read for yourself,\"<br />\nAnd she passed me her card;<br />\nSure enough there was \"Love,\"<br />\nWrit in characters plain,<br />\n\"You're right,\" I admitted,<br />\nAs I read it again.<br />\n<br />\nSo you see I've a reason,<br />\nFor neglecting sweet Bess,<br />\nCeasing verses to Dolly,<br />\nAnd sonnets to Tess;<br />\nFor who'd care for trifles,<br />\nWhen one can go higher,<br />\nAnd sing of the \"Love\" found,<br />\nWith darling Maria?<br />\n<br />\nSPARKS.<br />\nBrevity is the goal of vaudeville.<br />\n<br />\nAn auto maxim\u2014Oil the rod and spare<br />\nthe file.<br />\n<br />\nEvery girl has her stay.<br />\nA profit is honored in every country.<br />\nThe ages of sin are many.<br />\nTo the schoolboy the bough of a tree is<br />\nThe flush of victory\u2014Ace, King, Queen, worse than its bark.<br />\nJack, ten, of hearts.<br />\nMan wants but little here below\u2014and<br />\nPeace is fine, especially pieces of cake.<br />\ngenerally keeps on wanting.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS DANCE.<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\n<br />\nThe first Hopkins Dance of the season was<br />\ngiven by the Cotillon Club on the evening<br />\nof Nov 25, and was successful in every way.<br />\nThe work of the committee was done in a<br />\nthoughtful and painstaking manner, while<br />\nthe experience gained in former years was<br />\nput to excellent service. McCoy Hall, bearing with it so many associations, was appropriately decorated with the trophies of many<br />\ncontests, and with the class banners of those<br />\nmen who helped to win them. The music<br />\nand supper also received proper attention,<br />\nand in spite of the fact that we had just seen<br />\nour team go down in defeat before the St.<br />\nJohn's eleven, the evening was spent most<br />\npleasantly.

All during the<br />\npast two weeks the daily papers have devoted column after column to a discussion of<br />\nthe probable outcome of the battle to abolish football. Presidents of the different universities represented by the sport have been<br />\ninterviewed and quoted, famous coaches<br />\nhave been questioned, and, most singificant<br />\nof all\u2014the Chief Executive of the Nation<br />\nhas taken up the matter and in his usual<br />\nstrenuous manner, has been most active in<br />\nbringing to the foreground some practical<br />\nsuggestions.<br />\nPresident Roosevelt's suggestions were<br />\nalong the line of preserving the game by<br />\nabolishing the objectionable features connected with it in its present form. His idea<br />\nin the main is, that, by countenancing \"slugging\" and foul play, the general demoralization thus caused is frequently more to be<br />\ndeplored than the single instances of physical injury. These demoralizing features,<br />\nthinks the President, can be abolished, and<br />\nthe football experts with whom he has been<br />\nin consultation are of the same opinion, as<br />\nshown by the activity which they have since<br />\naroused looking to this end.<br />\nPresident Remsen, whose interest in manly<br />\nsports has frequently been demonstrated, believes with President Roosevelt that the<br />\ngame, if devoid of underhand and unsportsmanlike features, is one that should be preserved in that it promotes manliness and<br />\ncourage<br />\nColumbia and the New York University<br />\nhave gone to the extreme in that they have<br />\nentirely abolished the game from their<br />\nsports. Other universities, such as the University of Minnesota, are willing to make<br />\nany reasonable innovation in order to preserve the game.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n\"Socker,\" or association football has<br />\ntaken advantage of the fight and has come<br />\ninto more prominence than it has ever known<br />\nin this country. But despite the enthusiasm<br />\nwith which it has been championed, we do<br />\nnot believe that it affords a worthy substitute<br />\nfor the rugby game. In fact, we should not<br />\nbe surprised if lacrosse will, in the end, receive greater impetus from the present agitation than the association game.<br />\nThat changes will be made in football by<br />\nnext season is inevitable, but it is a question<br />\nwhether these changes will be radical. The<br />\npresent discussion, although having some<br />\nfoundation in fact, is to a great extent newspaper \"copy\" and \"hysteria\" as one of the<br />\nexperts termed it. Moreover we do not believe that the game will be abolished any<br />\nmore than we believe baseball will be abolished. It is impossible to down a good game,<br />\nand we think that with a few changes in the<br />\nrules football will hold public interest to a<br />\nlarger extent next season than ever before.<br />\n<br />\nAS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.<br />\n(I want to go home now; indeed I do,<br />\nI'm anxious to roam now\u2014away from you.<br />\nYou've been awfully kind folks\u2014and yet<br />\n'tis true,<br />\nI want to go home now; indeed I do).<br />\nHEBREW.<br />\nLeket baitah hafasti, 'attah be-emet,<br />\nIwwiti te`ot wetahote gaw mikkem.<br />\nIm ki 'immi hesed, re'ai, 'asitem;<br />\nLeket baitah hafasti, 'attah be-emet.<br />\nGREEK.<br />\nBoulomai elthein, nun oikade<br />\nThelo planasthai\u2014ouk ekon se<br />\nKai agathoi este, althea de<br />\nBoulomai elthein, nun oikade.<br />\nLATIN.<br />\nExire domum\u2014nunc volo<br />\nErrare solus\u2014cupio<br />\nlucundi fuistis--sed declaro<br />\nExire domum\u2014nunc volo.<br />\n<br />\n\fPI<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS, 5; ST JOHNS, 11.<br />\nThe surprise of the local football season<br />\nwas the defeat of the Hopkins eleven on Nov.<br />\n25. It was a very hard game to lose, especially toward the close of so successful a<br />\nseason, but it emphasized the point that a<br />\nteam which plays together like one man, can<br />\noften disconcert its opponents, no matter<br />\nhow desperately those opponents may play.<br />\nThough St. Johns deserves every credit for<br />\nthe work of her eleven, everyone that had<br />\nseen Hopkins play before were forced to<br />\nadmit that the Black and Blue had suffered<br />\nfrom an immense reversal of form.<br />\nHopkins kicked to Duval, of St. John's,<br />\nand soon held for downs. By hard playing,<br />\nthe Black and Blue gradually forced the<br />\nleather to St. John's 3 yd. line, where the<br />\nfirst of a series of costly fumbles took place.<br />\nThe ball rolled over the goal line, where a<br />\nSt. John's player fell upon it. When St.<br />\nJohn's next got the ball, they started down<br />\nthe field with steady progress. Quarter-back<br />\nruns by Duval, fake kicks, and a modification of the old quarter-back kick netted them<br />\nyard after yard, until finally the ball was<br />\npushed over for the first score.<br />\nDuval<br />\nkicked goal.<br />\nSt. John's then attempted a fake kick off,<br />\nthe ball rolling to Haas, who fell upon it.<br />\nSteady line plays were tried by J. H. U. with<br />\nsuccess, the ball being slowly carried down<br />\nfield by Worthington, Michael and Moss, to<br />\nthe 20 yard line. Worthington went through<br />\nleft tackle and ran the twenty yards for a<br />\ntouchdown. He failed at goal.<br />\nHopkins then kicked off to St. John's.<br />\nDuval made two quarter-back runs in sue-<br />\n<br />\ncession, gaining forty yards as a result, but<br />\non a fake play he was thrown out by MacSherry for a loss. The first half ended soon<br />\nafterwards, with the ball in Hopkins' possession in the center of the field.<br />\nAt the beginning of the second half, by<br />\nmeans of end runs, varied by plunges<br />\nthrough the line, St. John's took the ball to<br />\nwithin a few feet of the goal line, where<br />\nStevens was sent over for St. John's second<br />\ntouchdown. Duval failed to kick goal.<br />\nSt. John's kicked off to Worthington, who<br />\nadvanced the ball several yards. The 'Varsity at this point seemed to pull together,<br />\nbut after the leather had been carried 20<br />\nyards, another wretched fumble gave the ball<br />\nto St. John's. By fake kicks and delayed<br />\npasses, together with good line plunging, St.<br />\nJohn's carried the ball to Hopkins' 1 yard<br />\nline and it looked as if the team from Annapolis would score a third time. The Black<br />\nand Blue held, however, and Michael punted<br />\nout from behind his own goal line. Brotherhood, Campbell, Estes and Bradenburg, a<br />\nnew center, came into the game. They seemed<br />\nto infuse new life into the team, for the<br />\nBlack and Blue forcing their opponents to<br />\nkick. Then the home team played as they<br />\nhad not played before. Worthington hurdled, and tore big holes in the opponents'<br />\nline; Campbell made some good end runs,<br />\nand the whole team played with magnificent<br />\nspirit. MaeSherry gained 20 yards on a<br />\nrun around right end. Brotherhood did the<br />\nsame around the other, but time was called<br />\nas he was downed in the center of the field.<br />\nAltogether, it was a hard game for Hopkins to lose. Fumbling and weakness on<br />\nthe ends were, in a measure, responsible for<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nthe defeat, but the whole team did not play<br />\nits best, for some reason, while St. John 's<br />\nundoubtedly played a brilliant and hard<br />\ngame. Worthington, on the offensive, Moss,<br />\nIglehart and Brotherhood showed up best<br />\nfor the Black and Blue, while Duval and<br />\nStevens were St. John's particular stars.<br />\nThe line-up:\u2014<br />\nST.

OF M. 5.<br />\nHopkins finished its schedule Thanksgiving Day by defeating Maryland 33 to 5, in<br />\na game too onesided to be interesting. From<br />\nthe start the lIopkins boys outclassed their<br />\nopponents and easily scored five touchdowns<br />\nin the first half.<br />\nThe second half was closer and more interesting. The Maryland team played harder and aided by a slump on the part of the<br />\nHopkins eleven, held the Black and Blue<br />\nEarly in this<br />\ndown to one touchdown.<br />\nperiod Maryland made its only score by<br />\nstraight rushing.<br />\nThe feature of the game was Michael's run<br />\nof 90 yards, after a fumble by the Maryland<br />\nquarterback. This came near the end of<br />\nthe second half and was the only interesting<br />\nplay in an otherwise dull game.<br />\n<br />\nBASKET BALL.<br />\nAgain the question \"Shall we have a basket-ball team?\" has come up. Of course, it's<br />\nthe option of the board of directors of the<br />\nAthletic Association to affirm or veto the<br />\nproposition, but right here it seems proper<br />\nto say that the general sentiment among the<br />\nundergraduates is for a team.<br />\nLast year marked the entrance of Hopkins<br />\ninto this new field of sport, and considering<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nthe circumstances, which at the start were<br />\nfar from propitious, the season was a successful one. We won and lost from our football<br />\nrival, the University of Maryland; we lost<br />\nOur<br />\nto Penn but won from Dickinson.<br />\nrecord was such that challenges have already<br />\nbeen received from many colleges; among<br />\nthem Columbia, intercollegiate champions of<br />\nthe country last year; Lehigh, Swarthmore,<br />\nand several others.<br />\nThe principal objection to a team this year<br />\nis a financial one, and the outcome of the<br />\nfinancial side of the football season will probably decide the question. Last year, although<br />\nthe team received no financial assistance<br />\nfrom the Athletic Association, the team came<br />\nout ahead on the season. Why cannot this<br />\nbe done again this year?<br />\nActing on the order of last season's captain, and the board of governors of the Athletic Association, the manager has secured<br />\ndates of a provisory nature, which can be<br />\ncalled off in case we have no team. He has<br />\nalready booked two games with Lehigh, one<br />\nhere and the other at South Bethlehem, and<br />\nnegotiations are now pending with Princeton, Pennsylvania, Swarthmore, Virginia,<br />\nand Maryland. It will be noticed that a<br />\nmore pretentions schedule is being arranged<br />\nfor this season; the same policy as was pursued in regard to the football team. It is<br />\na great deal better to lose to a large college<br />\nthan snow under some little unheard of institution. We cannot always win as the St.<br />\nJohn's game demonstrated, but we can play<br />\ncreditable teams.<br />\nFour of last year's \"five\" are again at<br />\nthe University\u2014Blanck, Holmes, McClure,<br />\nand Boyd. Magoffin, Estes, Stewart, and<br />\nMacSherry, of the 'varsity football team,<br />\nhave promised to come out for the team. Beside these are Nichols, Branham, Padgett,<br />\nBreyer, and several first year men at the<br />\nMedical School. As basket-ball interferes<br />\nwith neither lacrosse, track, or baseball, let<br />\nus have a team and take a decided step upward in the realm of athletics.<br />\nE. H.

A great<br />\ndeal of interest is being shown by all, and although the regular practices do not begin<br />\nuntil after the Christmas holidays, the cage<br />\nalready resounds with the smack of the lacrosse ball. A new plan is being tried this<br />\nyear which, it is thought, will prove very<br />\nbeneficial.

The floor was in first-class condition, the music was furnished by a good<br />\norchestra, the decorations tasteful, and the<br />\nsupper well appointed and served with more<br />\nexpedience than usual.<br />\nFrom the large number of couples on the<br />\nfloor, it is evident that the dances are growing in popularity, and it is pleasing to note<br />\nthe marked increase in the number of patronesses.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nYet, as praise seldom goes without further<br />\nadvice, we would like to suggest a change<br />\nin the dance programmes. From opinions<br />\nexpressed during the evening, it would seem<br />\nthat the style of programmes used this seaion are not as popular as the style in vogue<br />\nat the dances last year. The narrow Black<br />\nand Blue stripes on the cover of the programmes do not show up as well as the<br />\nbroader bands, and it is an open question as<br />\nto whether the Hopkins shield does not make<br />\na neater appearance on the front of the card<br />\nthan the large script writing.<br />\nOnly one other suggestion, and that is that<br />\ncoffee\u2014good bracing coffee\u2014be served after<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nthe ices. Dancing is a delightful pastime,<br />\nbut after eight solid numbers, a cup of coffee<br />\nmakes it much easier to get through the<br />\nother eight dances.<br />\nT last the arrangements for a Hopkins<br />\nnight at the theatre have been completed. This Saturday evening, the<br />\nmajority of Hopkins supporters will go in a<br />\nbody to see \"The Pearl and the Pumpkin\"<br />\nat the Academy of Music. Upon the success<br />\nof this revival of the custom of having Hopkins nights at the theatre depends whether<br />\nor not these entertainments be again brought<br />\ninto vogue, so it is to be sincerely hoped the<br />\npresent arrangements will be adequate in<br />\nevery particular. However, we have every<br />\nreason to believe that this will be the case,<br />\nand the present outlook is most promising<br />\ntoward the enjoyment of a very agreeable<br />\nevening. The \"Hopkins theatre night\" is<br />\na good custom, and everything seems to<br />\npoint toward the permanent revival of one<br />\nof the most pleasant features in the University's social life.<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nERHAPS the only feature of the football season which the Hopkins has<br />\ncause to regret, is the outcome of the<br />\nSt. John's game. But there is an incident<br />\nconnected with that game which ought to<br />\nbe of sincere congratulation to all those who<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nhave the best interests of the University at<br />\nheart.<br />\nAll who were present at the contest know<br />\nhow unexpected and galling was our defeat,<br />\nand in the excitement of the moment, to<br />\nmany Hopkins supporters it seemed almost<br />\ninexcusable that a team which had come so<br />\nsuccessfully through so long a season should<br />\nat the critical moment fall victims to the dash<br />\nand to the strategy of a doubtful rival. Yet<br />\nnever for an instant did our rooters lose<br />\nheart or fail to support the eleven with utmost vigor. And after the game was over,<br />\nand this is the incident to which we would<br />\nespecially call attention, they gathered round<br />\nthe Hopkins team and cheered it with more<br />\nenthusiasm and to greater length than if it<br />\nhad come off victorious.<br />\nWe believe we<br />\nhave seldom seen such an outburst of Hopkins spirit, and it gives much promise that<br />\nthe new era in Hopkins good-fellowship has<br />\ncome to stay.<br /><br />\nswer received on account of it coming from<br />\na college which has won the football championship of 1905, was from Yale. As the<br />\nletter to our mind covers the matter in<br />\nquestion better than anything we have seen,<br />\nwe take the liberty of printing it in full.<br />\nJohns Hopkins N4ws-LzTTnR,<br /><br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nDear Sirs:\u2014<br />\nIn reply to the questions contained in<br />\nyour letter of Nov. 21st, I would say that<br />\nin answer to the first question, it seems to<br />\nme that there will probably be some few<br />\nchanges in football rules before the beginning of another season, but I do not look<br />\nfor any radical changes. It is barely possible that the officials may be given a wider<br />\nrange of authority in order to prevent unfair play.<br />\nIn answer to question No. 2, I would say<br />\nthat this college would very firmly support<br />\nsuch a movement.<br />\nIn reply to question No. 3, I do not, personally, believe that football as it is now<br />\nN another part of this issue may be found played is having, generally speaking, a harman article discussing the agitation which ful effect upon college athletics or upon the<br />\nhas lately been raised over the objec- players individually.<br />\ntionable features of football. The NewsVery truly yours,<br />\nUTTER, however, not wishing to be too much<br />\nEDWIN WHITE,<br />\ndependent upon views expressed in the daily<br />\n(Manager, Yale University Football<br />\npapers, sent letters to the managers of sevAssociation).<br />\neral of the larger Eastern football elevens,<br />\nasking, in the main, the following questions:<br />\nN glancing over the Preliminary Register<br />\n1. Will any radical changes be made in footand Enumeration of Classes, which has<br />\nball? 2. Will your college take any steps<br />\njust been issued, one can not help being<br />\ntoward making such changes? 3. Do you struck by the small number of students in<br />\nbelieve football, as it is now played, is harm- the Classical Department as compared with<br />\nful either to the best interests of college the large number following the Chemical and<br />\nathletics or of the players themselves?<br />\nPhysical Sciences. Twenty years ago, and<br />\nAlthough some of the managers corres- even less, in the days of the old Classical<br />\nponded with, notably Harvard, Columbia, Course, Latin and Greek were deemed withand Cornell, declined to answer the ques- out doubt absolutely essential to a satisfactions directly on account of lack of specific tory college education. Now, not only are<br />\nknowledge, nevertheless their replies seemed these studies not compulsory, but they are<br />\nto infer that they did not believe the present scarcely encouraged. Whether the new sysuproar about modifying the game would re- tem or the old is theoretically better it is<br />\nsult in any startling changes. From Dart- difficult to say; indeed ,we think that very<br />\nmouth we received a negative answer to the few authorities would care to give a definite<br />\nfirst two questions, and to the third a reply opinion. But one thing is clear. The men<br />\nthat although there were doubtless certain who are turned out of college to-day are just<br />\nabuses which should be eradicated, yet on as efficient and just as happy as those who<br />\nthe whole that football was commendable grew up under the old system. Taking this<br />\nsport. However, the most interesting an- fact into consideration along with the prac-<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntical tendency of the times, there can be but<br />\nlittle doubt of the value of a thorough training in the sciences. Nevertheless, one can<br />\nnot but ask whether eventually this falling<br />\noff in the Classical Departments will not<br />\nweaken an important branch of the intellectual strength of the university.<br />\nT is extremely interesting to note in the<br />\ncurrent issue of the \"Literary Digest,\"<br />\na spirited approval of Mr. James Speyer's endowment of a \"Theodore Roosevelt<br />\nProfessorship\" in the University of Berlin,<br />\nin which the opinions of Presidents Butler<br />\nof Columbia and Eliot of Harvard are aired,<br />\ntogether with editorial extracts from the<br />\nNew York \"Times\" and \"Evening Post.\"<br />\nThe \"Literary Digest,\" despite its reputation for acquaintance with the first words of<br />\nevery national or inter-national discussion,<br />\napparently overlooked the fact that Dr. William Osler, formerly of this University, was<br />\nprobably the first American professor to express his approval of an interchange of European and American teachers. Dr. Osler<br />\nexpressed himself very strongly on this point<br />\nin the same speech in which he advocated an<br />\nage limit for active professors.<br />\nRegarding the gift of Mr. Speyer, the<br />\n\"Literary Digest\" quotes President Butler<br />\nas saying, that by the endowment of the<br />\nnew professorship, a way is opened for the<br />\n\"careful, systematic, and scientific presentation of the culture of one people to the students of another.\" This is but the echo of<br />\nwhat Dr. Osler remarked in his speech given<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nin McCoy Hall on February 22, 1905. \"The<br />\n\"Literary Digest\" would be losing nothing,<br />\nif time was taken to look up Dr. Osler's<br />\nspeech, and pains were taken to learn more<br />\nof it than the mere subsidiary allusions to<br />\nthe \"chloroform method.\"<br />\nApropos the editorial quoted by the \"Literary Digest\" from the New York \"Times,\"<br />\nthe NEw-Ltrra desires to put in an humble<br />\nword. The \"Times\" says: \"There will follow, as day follows dawn, a like system (of<br />\ninter-change of professors), first in other<br />\nGerman and American universities, and then<br />\nin those of France, of England, and\u2014who<br />\nknows?\u2014of Russia.\"<br />\nThe \"Times\" seems to regard the establishmentof such a system with regard to Russia, with an indulgence born of contempt.<br />\nBut we would suggest that from an economic<br />\nstandpoint, possibly more good would come<br />\nfrom the endowment of a Russian chair in<br />\none of the American universities than would<br />\ncome from an inter-change with any one of<br />\nthe first named countries. Our reason for<br />\nmaking this conjecture in the teeth of such<br />\na respected editorial column as maintained<br />\nby the \"Times,\" is this: Russia, as a nation,<br />\nis passing through an economic stage,<br />\nthrough which England passed centuries ago,<br />\nand through which this country has never<br />\npassed. Of this stage our economists know<br />\nat most but little. Would it not be as material an advantage to have the conditions of<br />\nserfdom, as demonstrated in Modern Russia<br />\ntaught us by men who have lived in actual<br />\ntouch with such conditions, as would be the<br />\npresentation to us of European culture?<br /><br />\nThe Song of Calypso.<br />\nAwake, awake, Ulysses, wake,<br />\nThe dawn of day is drawing nigh;<br />\nAwake, arise, 0 Greek, arise,<br />\nAurora tints the Eastern sky<br />\nAwake, awake, Ulysses, wake,<br />\nNo longer slumber by the sea;<br />\nAwake, arise, 0 Greek, arise,<br />\nThy loved Calypso calleth thee<br />\n'07.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE 'VARSITY FOOTBALL SEASON.<br />\nThe Hopkins football season, which was<br />\nbrought to a close by the University of Maryland game on Thanksgiving Day, has been<br />\nmost successful. Beginning the autumn by<br />\ndefeating Delaware College 11 to 0, it managed to come out at the finish with but one<br />\ndefeat. Undoubtedly the two contests in<br />\nwhich the Black and Blue showed themselves<br />\nmost strong was in the Mt. Washington game<br />\non Nov. 4, and in the Haverford game a week<br />\nlater. In the Baltimore Medical College<br />\ngame the eleven was not forced to show its<br />\nbest form, and the consequent slump ended<br />\nin the St. John's game, when the team was<br />\nbadly rattled by the unexpected tactics of<br />\nthe cadets. However, in the last contest, the<br />\nteam regained its form and the result of the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland contest was never in<br />\ndoubt from the first kick-off.<br />\nThe team as a whole contained many of<br />\nlast year's men, but new additions made<br />\nit superior to last year's eleven. However,<br />\nsome losses were keenly felt, and it was unfortunate that Randall was only able to play<br />\nin one game. Among the backs, Magoffin<br />\nplayed especially good ball, and his injury<br />\nin the St. John's game may have had something to do with the team's defeat. Captain<br />\nWorthington proved also an excellent ground<br />\ngainer, and could almost invariably be relied upon to push the ball forward. However, on the defense, he was not as strong<br />\nas might be expected.<br />\nHart, Webb and<br />\nCampbell all played good ball, and the latter, toward the end, of the season, showed<br />\nhimself to be a very valuable addition to<br />\nthe speed of the team.<br />\nAt quarter back, Iglehart and Brotherhood both suffered from lack of weight.<br />\nIglehart showed good judgment in running<br /><br />\nthe plays, and by his sure open-field tackling<br />\nsaved many a score. He also could run with<br />\nthe ball. Brotherhood, however, managed<br />\nto get more snap in the team, and otherwise<br />\nplayed well.<br />\nOf the ends, Stewart, Estes and MacSherry<br />\nwere good, and though the latter was inclined to be erratic, yet his brilliancy more<br />\nthan made up for it. In the line, Michael<br />\nwas the undoubted star, and shone especially<br />\nwell on the defense. His kicking (as, by<br />\nthe way, was Campbell's work along this<br />\nline), was excellent. The rest of the line<br />\nplayed well and hard, though sometimes not<br />\nreceiving proper support from the backs.<br />\nThe team, as is usual with IIopkins football elevens, suffered somewhat from lack of<br />\npractice, and also from the fact that the men<br />\ndid not train. The latter condition we do<br />\nnot believe is so much a matter of necessity<br />\non account of Hopkins peculiar position as<br />\nsome think it to be, and we believe that<br />\nmuch improvement could be made in that<br />\ndirection.<br />\nManager Shackleford showed<br />\nhimself to be most efficient, and the schedule<br />\narranged was excellent.

McCoy Hall, bearing with it so many associations, was appropriately decorated with the trophies of many<br />\ncontests, and with the class banners of those<br />\nmen who helped to win them. The music<br />\nand supper also received proper attention,<br />\nand in spite of the fact that we had just seen<br />\nour team go down in defeat before the St.<br />\nJohn's eleven, the evening was spent most<br />\npleasantly. However, it could be noticed<br />\nthat few had enough spirit (or money) to<br />\njoin in the chorus of \"Everybody Bets on<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nAs usual, the wide corridors around the<br />\nhall, hung with their portraits and pictures,<br />\npresented a delightful promenade for the<br />\ndancers during the intermissions, and afforded ample room for those present to mingle<br />\nfreely, or to sit and watch the others pass<br />\nbefore them<br />\nThe question of chaperons had also been<br />\ncarefully considered, and a number of the<br />\nprofessors and their wives graced the occasion.

All during the<br />\npast two weeks the daily papers have devoted column after column to a discussion of<br />\nthe probable outcome of the battle to abolish football. Presidents of the different universities represented by the sport have been<br />\ninterviewed and quoted, famous coaches<br />\nhave been questioned, and, most singificant<br />\nof all\u2014the Chief Executive of the Nation<br />\nhas taken up the matter and in his usual<br />\nstrenuous manner, has been most active in<br />\nbringing to the foreground some practical<br />\nsuggestions.<br />\nPresident Roosevelt's suggestions were<br />\nalong the line of preserving the game by<br />\nabolishing the objectionable features connected with it in its present form. His idea<br />\nin the main is, that, by countenancing \"slugging\" and foul play, the general demoralization thus caused is frequently more to be<br />\ndeplored than the single instances of physical injury. These demoralizing features,<br />\nthinks the President, can be abolished, and<br />\nthe football experts with whom he has been<br />\nin consultation are of the same opinion, as<br />\nshown by the activity which they have since<br />\naroused looking to this end.<br />\nPresident Remsen, whose interest in manly<br />\nsports has frequently been demonstrated, believes with President Roosevelt that the<br />\ngame, if devoid of underhand and unsportsmanlike features, is one that should be preserved in that it promotes manliness and<br />\ncourage<br />\nColumbia and the New York University<br />\nhave gone to the extreme in that they have<br />\nentirely abolished the game from their<br />\nsports. Other universities, such as the University of Minnesota, are willing to make<br />\nany reasonable innovation in order to preserve the game.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n\"Socker,\" or association football has<br />\ntaken advantage of the fight and has come<br />\ninto more prominence than it has ever known<br />\nin this country. But despite the enthusiasm<br />\nwith which it has been championed, we do<br />\nnot believe that it affords a worthy substitute<br />\nfor the rugby game. In fact, we should not<br />\nbe surprised if lacrosse will, in the end, receive greater impetus from the present agitation than the association game.<br />\nThat changes will be made in football by<br />\nnext season is inevitable, but it is a question<br />\nwhether these changes will be radical. The<br />\npresent discussion, although having some<br />\nfoundation in fact, is to a great extent newspaper \"copy\" and \"hysteria\" as one of the<br />\nexperts termed it. Moreover we do not believe that the game will be abolished any<br />\nmore than we believe baseball will be abolished. It is impossible to down a good game,<br />\nand we think that with a few changes in the<br />\nrules football will hold public interest to a<br />\nlarger extent next season than ever before.<br /><br />\nAS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.<br />\n(I want to go home now; indeed I do,<br />\nI'm anxious to roam now\u2014away from you.<br />\nYou've been awfully kind folks\u2014and yet<br />\n'tis true,<br />\nI want to go home now; indeed I do).<br />\nHEBREW.<br />\nLeket baitah hafasti, 'attah be-emet,<br />\nIwwiti te`ot wetahote gaw mikkem.<br />\nIm ki 'immi hesed, re'ai, 'asitem;<br />\nLeket baitah hafasti, 'attah be-emet.<br />\nGREEK.<br />\nBoulomai elthein, nun oikade<br />\nThelo planasthai\u2014ouk ekon se<br />\nKai agathoi este, althea de<br />\nBoulomai elthein, nun oikade.<br />\nLATIN.<br />\nExire domum\u2014nunc volo<br />\nErrare solus\u2014cupio<br />\nlucundi fuistis--sed declaro<br />\nExire domum\u2014nunc volo.<br /><br />\nPI<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 5; ST JOHNS, 11.<br />\nThe surprise of the local football season<br />\nwas the defeat of the Hopkins eleven on Nov.<br />\n25. It was a very hard game to lose, especially toward the close of so successful a<br />\nseason, but it emphasized the point that a<br />\nteam which plays together like one man, can<br />\noften disconcert its opponents, no matter<br />\nhow desperately those opponents may play.<br />\nThough St. Johns deserves every credit for<br />\nthe work of her eleven, everyone that had<br />\nseen Hopkins play before were forced to<br />\nadmit that the Black and Blue had suffered<br />\nfrom an immense reversal of form.<br />\nHopkins kicked to Duval, of St. John's,<br />\nand soon held for downs. By hard playing,<br />\nthe Black and Blue gradually forced the<br />\nleather to St. John's 3 yd. line, where the<br />\nfirst of a series of costly fumbles took place.<br />\nThe ball rolled over the goal line, where a<br />\nSt. John's player fell upon it. When St.<br />\nJohn's next got the ball, they started down<br />\nthe field with steady progress. Quarter-back<br />\nruns by Duval, fake kicks, and a modification of the old quarter-back kick netted them<br />\nyard after yard, until finally the ball was<br />\npushed over for the first score.<br />\nDuval<br />\nkicked goal.<br />\nSt. John's then attempted a fake kick off,<br />\nthe ball rolling to Haas, who fell upon it.<br />\nSteady line plays were tried by J. H. U. with<br />\nsuccess, the ball being slowly carried down<br />\nfield by Worthington, Michael and Moss, to<br />\nthe 20 yard line. Worthington went through<br />\nleft tackle and ran the twenty yards for a<br />\ntouchdown. He failed at goal.<br />\nHopkins then kicked off to St. John's.<br />\nDuval made two quarter-back runs in sue-<br /><br />\ncession, gaining forty yards as a result, but<br />\non a fake play he was thrown out by MacSherry for a loss. The first half ended soon<br />\nafterwards, with the ball in Hopkins' possession in the center of the field.<br />\nAt the beginning of the second half, by<br />\nmeans of end runs, varied by plunges<br />\nthrough the line, St. John's took the ball to<br />\nwithin a few feet of the goal line, where<br />\nStevens was sent over for St. John's second<br />\ntouchdown. Duval failed to kick goal.<br />\nSt. John's kicked off to Worthington, who<br />\nadvanced the ball several yards. The 'Varsity at this point seemed to pull together,<br />\nbut after the leather had been carried 20<br />\nyards, another wretched fumble gave the ball<br />\nto St. John's. By fake kicks and delayed<br />\npasses, together with good line plunging, St.<br />\nJohn's carried the ball to Hopkins' 1 yard<br />\nline and it looked as if the team from Annapolis would score a third time. The Black<br />\nand Blue held, however, and Michael punted<br />\nout from behind his own goal line. Brotherhood, Campbell, Estes and Bradenburg, a<br />\nnew center, came into the game. They seemed<br />\nto infuse new life into the team, for the<br />\nBlack and Blue forcing their opponents to<br />\nkick. Then the home team played as they<br />\nhad not played before. Worthington hurdled, and tore big holes in the opponents'<br />\nline; Campbell made some good end runs,<br />\nand the whole team played with magnificent<br />\nspirit. MaeSherry gained 20 yards on a<br />\nrun around right end. Brotherhood did the<br />\nsame around the other, but time was called<br />\nas he was downed in the center of the field.<br />\nAltogether, it was a hard game for Hopkins to lose. Fumbling and weakness on<br />\nthe ends were, in a measure, responsible for<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nthe defeat, but the whole team did not play<br />\nits best, for some reason, while St. John 's<br />\nundoubtedly played a brilliant and hard<br />\ngame. Worthington, on the offensive, Moss,<br />\nIglehart and Brotherhood showed up best<br />\nfor the Black and Blue, while Duval and<br />\nStevens were St. John's particular stars.<br />\nThe line-up:\u2014<br />\nST.

From<br />\nthe start the lIopkins boys outclassed their<br />\nopponents and easily scored five touchdowns<br />\nin the first half.<br />\nThe second half was closer and more interesting.

This came near the end of<br />\nthe second half and was the only interesting<br />\nplay in an otherwise dull game.<br /><br />\nBASKET BALL.<br />\nAgain the question \"Shall we have a basket-ball team?\" has come up. Of course, it's<br />\nthe option of the board of directors of the<br />\nAthletic Association to affirm or veto the<br />\nproposition, but right here it seems proper<br />\nto say that the general sentiment among the<br />\nundergraduates is for a team.<br />\nLast year marked the entrance of Hopkins<br />\ninto this new field of sport, and considering<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nthe circumstances, which at the start were<br />\nfar from propitious, the season was a successful one. We won and lost from our football<br />\nrival, the University of Maryland; we lost<br />\nOur<br />\nto Penn but won from Dickinson.<br />\nrecord was such that challenges have already<br />\nbeen received from many colleges; among<br />\nthem Columbia, intercollegiate champions of<br />\nthe country last year; Lehigh, Swarthmore,<br />\nand several others.<br />\nThe principal objection to a team this year<br />\nis a financial one, and the outcome of the<br />\nfinancial side of the football season will probably decide the question. Last year, although<br />\nthe team received no financial assistance<br />\nfrom the Athletic Association, the team came<br />\nout ahead on the season. Why cannot this<br />\nbe done again this year?<br />\nActing on the order of last season's captain, and the board of governors of the Athletic Association, the manager has secured<br />\ndates of a provisory nature, which can be<br />\ncalled off in case we have no team. He has<br />\nalready booked two games with Lehigh, one<br />\nhere and the other at South Bethlehem, and<br />\nnegotiations are now pending with Princeton, Pennsylvania, Swarthmore, Virginia,<br />\nand Maryland. It will be noticed that a<br />\nmore pretentions schedule is being arranged<br />\nfor this season; the same policy as was pursued in regard to the football team. It is<br />\na great deal better to lose to a large college<br />\nthan snow under some little unheard of institution. We cannot always win as the St.<br />\nJohn's game demonstrated, but we can play<br />\ncreditable teams.<br />\nFour of last year's \"five\" are again at<br />\nthe University\u2014Blanck, Holmes, McClure,<br />\nand Boyd. Magoffin, Estes, Stewart, and<br />\nMacSherry, of the 'varsity football team,<br />\nhave promised to come out for the team. Beside these are Nichols, Branham, Padgett,<br />\nBreyer, and several first year men at the<br />\nMedical School. As basket-ball interferes<br />\nwith neither lacrosse, track, or baseball, let<br />\nus have a team and take a decided step upward in the realm of athletics.<br />\nE. H.

A great<br />\ndeal of interest is being shown by all, and although the regular practices do not begin<br />\nuntil after the Christmas holidays, the cage<br />\nalready resounds with the smack of the lacrosse ball. A new plan is being tried this<br />\nyear which, it is thought, will prove very<br />\nbeneficial.
