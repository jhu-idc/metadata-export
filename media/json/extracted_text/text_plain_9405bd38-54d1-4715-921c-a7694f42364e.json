It is just<br />\nas crooked for a student to cram<br />\nhis head with innumerable details<br />\nat the last minute as it is to actually carry written information into<br />\nthe examination room. What is<br />\nhastily collected is usually of an<br />\nunimportant nature and will crowd<br />\nout the fundamental ideas gathered<br />\nduring the whole semester.\" Dr.<br />\nBaker's last statement appears to<br />\ncontradict his first premise, for what<br />\nsimilarity could there be between<br />\ncheating and cramming if one<br />\ncrams unimportant details. We<br />\nhave encountered very few examinations which were made up of unimportant details.

For<br />\nthe purposes of definition, the university designates and classifies students, not by the actual time spent<br />\nat classes, but by the number of<br />\ncredits. That is: third year students are those having between 60<br />\nand 85 credits; fourth year men, 90<br />\nor more credits.<br />\nUnder this classification, those<br />\nstudents considered for admission<br />\nto the third year Will be the ones<br />\nwith 60 credits. This is not a requirement for admission, but a definition of third year men.<br />\nAs for marks, those sophomores<br />\nhaving an average of 80 or better,<br />\nwill automatically be accepted in the<br />\nthird year upon written application.<br />\nThose .who have lower averages<br />\nmust be considered separately. If<br />\na student -is *very poor in most of<br />\nhis 'subjects, he may still be admitted to the third year upon recommendation of any department in<br />\nwhich he has done especially good<br />\nwork. \"The real reqpirement is that<br />\nthe student show ari intellectual interest in some one department at<br />\nleast,\" Dr. Ames said.<br />\n<br />\nThe current issue of the Black<br />\nand Blue Jay has excited much comment around the campus, for it<br />\nmarks the second consecutive number of the magazine that has come<br />\nout on schedule. And, too, it is the<br />\nsecond consecutive number that has<br />\nhad a really good, smile-provoking<br />\ncover. Ben Kolb's catchy corruption of the popular air from the<br />\nMikado has started a virtual Gilbert<br />\n& Sullivan revival on the campus,<br />\nand bursts of laughter and nods of<br />\napproval everywhere greet this latest effort of our embryo humorists.<br />\nIt would appear, however, that<br />\nthe Jay feared approaching too close<br />\nto an unheard-of standard of excellence, and inserted a frontispiece<br />\nneither funny, appropriate nor interesting. There seemed to have been<br />\nan abundance of copy left over from<br />\nthe Wild West number, and the<br />\nmanaging editor is using it up at any<br />\ncost. The dubbing of exam, week<br />\nas \"Beef Week\" is a riduculously<br />\nobvious attempt to justify the steer<br />\nrampant on the drawing. But this<br />\nscreaming weakness is decidedly<br />\novershadowed by the quality of a<br />\nbook, on the whole.<br />\nAnother very outstanding feature<br />\nof the Jay is the symmetrical and<br />\nattractive page layout that may be<br />\nobserved throughout the issue.<br />\nInfluenced, perhaps by criticisms<br />\nof his recent editorials, Don White<br />\n<br />\nThe NORMAN-REMINGTON CO.<br />\nhas left off his program of moral<br />\nMAIN STORE,347 N.CHARLESST<br />\nuplift and reform on the campus and<br />\nranch Barpia, 1217 N.

Fisher, dean and<br />\nprofessor of History at Roberts<br />\nCollege in Constantinople, in a lecture on \"The Problem of Occident<br />\nand Orient\", delivered last Thursday afternoon as one of the Schouler lectures.<br />\nDr. Fisher who has been connected with Roberts College for the past<br />\nfifteen years, discussed the problems affecting East and West in regard to the establishment of good<br />\nwill between them. \"The West<br />\nshould realize the disastrousness<br />\nof force to its financial interests in<br />\nthe East,\" said Dr. Fisher. \"In<br />\nAsia the Asiatics have prior claims<br />\nwhich they must make good by war<br />\nIf not by peace. The West must<br />\ntecognize these claims as being just,<br />\nif amicable relations are to exist<br />\nbetween Orient and Occident.<br />\nWestern peoples must practice<br />\nequality and recognize the cultural<br />\nand religious merits of the East.<br />\nBy so doing we would do away with<br />\nthose cankers and danger spots that<br />\nmar our relations today.\"<br />\nWest Needs Leadership<br />\n<br />\nThe West needs a new type of<br />\nleadership to send to the East. It<br />\nshould send men of greater sympathy and breadth if the two great<br />\nportions of the world are to build<br />\non a basis of confidence. Contacts<br />\nin the past have been too much on<br />\nthe basis of unmitigated force. The<br />\nEasterners, therefore, find it difficult to understand us. Turkish Nationalists who succeeded in gaining<br />\nfreedom from European dominion<br />\nat Lausanne are still suspicious.<br />\nThough Turkey had great need of<br />\nrailroads, she refused the help of<br />\nforeign capital and said she would<br />\nhave no more of foreign concessions. \"We feel,\" Dr. Fisher pointed out, \"that the East thinks everything we have is beautiful, that the<br />\nEast needs us.\" Such an idea is<br />\ndecidedly erroneous. Turkish Nationalists who instituted a prohibition movement soon after the Great<br />\nWar were unable to make any<br />\nprogress until after the evacuation<br />\nof the Allied troops because of their<br />\ndetrimental influence. The West is<br />\nnot always beautiful or necessary..<br />\nExploitation Must Cease<br />\n<br />\nExploitation must be ceased. We<br />\nmust cease to use Eastern lands for<br />\nWestern benefit and must give up<br />\ncolonies held by force or markets<br />\nwhich are not on a co-operative<br />\nbasis. Extra-territorial rights for<br />\nforeigners must be surrendered as<br />\nthey have been in Turkey. When,<br />\nunder the terms of the Treaty of<br />\nLausanne, European powers gave<br />\nup these rights, they became subject to the law of the land and were<br />\nno longer exempt from taxation or<br />\ncustom duties. Consequently, these<br />\nforeigners live on the same basis as<br />\nthe Turk and have no unfair advantage over him which they for- merly possessed. Finally, the West<br />\nmust adopt a morle tolerant approach to the religion of the East,<br />\nremembering that it has its merits<br />\nthough it be non-Christian. The<br />\nEast, on the other hand, \"must<br />\nlearn adaptibility rather than mere<br />\nslavish copying,\" said Dr. Fisher. It<br />\nmust discard what hinders its progress just as Turkey has abolished<br />\nthe Sultanate, the Califfate, and the<br />\nfundamental law of the Koran, es(Continued on Page 4, Column 1)<br />\n<br />\nElections for President of the<br />\nStudent Council and delegates to<br />\nthe A.

Life insurance is most desirable<br />\nand satisfactory as a permanent<br />\ncalling.<br />\nAnd why?<br /><br />\nMoney<br />\nReports of college graduates<br />\nwho have entered business indicate that life insurance holds<br />\nfirst place as a source of income.<br />\nOne John Hancock agent describes his work as \"the best.<br />\npaid hard work in the world.\"<br />\nHe is a college graduate and in<br />\nfive years has put himself at<br />\nthe very top of his business.<br /><br />\nAdvancement<br /><br />\nThat is the story of one who began at the bottom<br />\nand reached the top without the help of a college<br />\neducation. The advantages are with you who graduate from college.<br /><br />\nFuture<br /><br />\nAnd there is so much room for ability and energy.<br />\nLife insurance, in volume of<br />\nbusiness, is one of the three<br />\nleading businesses in this country, and yet it is only in its<br />\nREASONS WHY<br />\nyouth because the possible ap\u2022 Life insurance is founded on high<br />\nplication of insurance is exideals.<br />\npanding all the time.<br />\n\u2022 It is capable of yielding a good in-<br /><br />\ncome and the satisfaction of accomplishment.<br />\n\u2022 It offers opportunities for real<br />\nleadership.<br />\n\u2022 It brings you in close association<br />\nwith business and business men.<br />\n\u2022 It requires you to become familiar<br />\nwith business methods, law and<br />\nfinance.<br />\n\u2022 It is afield for workers.not shirkers.<br />\n\u2022 It is an alluring and practical calling for men of dynamic energy.<br /><br />\nIn the second place, advancement depends entirely<br />\non your own effort and ability.<br />\nThis is no fairy-tale of success. It is the sober and<br />\nproved fact. The Vice-President of a great life insurance company who began his career as an agent<br />\nhas this to say to seniors who are about to graduate<br />\nfrom college:<br />\n\"If you love work and desire to pursue an honorable, useful and lucrative mission in life, this is the<br />\nbusiness for you to take up. Life insurance salesmanship offers a fine field for the energies of the splendid<br />\nyoung men in our colleges.<br />\n\"That this is true is demonstrated by those college<br />\nmen who have taken up life insurance, for they have<br />\nshown that the college man is fit for this kind of a job<br />\nand that the job also is fit for the college man.<br />\nThe work of the life insurance salesman is distinguished by independence and opportunity for directing his own activities. It gives all possible opportunity for individual initiative and a chance to make<br />\nan ample income at an age when most fellows are<br />\nstruggling on a wage pittance.\"<br /><br />\nSatisfaction<br /><br />\nBut all the pay and all the<br />\nadvancement possible are not<br />\ngoing to wholly satisfy the intelligent college graduate.

It is just<br />\nas crooked for a student to cram<br />\nhis head with innumerable details<br />\nat the last minute as it is to actually carry written information into<br />\nthe examination room. What is<br />\nhastily collected is usually of an<br />\nunimportant nature and will crowd<br />\nout the fundamental ideas gathered<br />\nduring the whole semester.\" Dr.<br />\nBaker's last statement appears to<br />\ncontradict his first premise, for what<br />\nsimilarity could there be between<br />\ncheating and cramming if one<br />\ncrams unimportant details. We<br />\nhave encountered very few examinations which were made up of unimportant details. Acting on his<br />\nbelief, however, the worthy doctor<br />\nproceeds to make out examinations<br />\nfor which cramming would be<br />\nworse than useless.<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nThe athletic association of the<br />\nUniversity of Minnesota derived a<br />\ncomfortable income from a unique<br />\nsource during the past winter.

For<br />\nthe purposes of definition, the university designates and classifies students, not by the actual time spent<br />\nat classes, but by the number of<br />\ncredits. That is: third year students are those having between 60<br />\nand 85 credits; fourth year men, 90<br />\nor more credits.<br />\nUnder this classification, those<br />\nstudents considered for admission<br />\nto the third year Will be the ones<br />\nwith 60 credits. This is not a requirement for admission, but a definition of third year men.<br />\nAs for marks, those sophomores<br />\nhaving an average of 80 or better,<br />\nwill automatically be accepted in the<br />\nthird year upon written application.<br />\nThose .who have lower averages<br />\nmust be considered separately. If<br />\na student -is *very poor in most of<br />\nhis 'subjects, he may still be admitted to the third year upon recommendation of any department in<br />\nwhich he has done especially good<br />\nwork. \"The real reqpirement is that<br />\nthe student show ari intellectual interest in some one department at<br />\nleast,\" Dr. Ames said.<br /><br />\nThe current issue of the Black<br />\nand Blue Jay has excited much comment around the campus, for it<br />\nmarks the second consecutive number of the magazine that has come<br />\nout on schedule. And, too, it is the<br />\nsecond consecutive number that has<br />\nhad a really good, smile-provoking<br />\ncover. Ben Kolb's catchy corruption of the popular air from the<br />\nMikado has started a virtual Gilbert<br />\n&amp; Sullivan revival on the campus,<br />\nand bursts of laughter and nods of<br />\napproval everywhere greet this latest effort of our embryo humorists.<br />\nIt would appear, however, that<br />\nthe Jay feared approaching too close<br />\nto an unheard-of standard of excellence, and inserted a frontispiece<br />\nneither funny, appropriate nor interesting. There seemed to have been<br />\nan abundance of copy left over from<br />\nthe Wild West number, and the<br />\nmanaging editor is using it up at any<br />\ncost. The dubbing of exam, week<br />\nas \"Beef Week\" is a riduculously<br />\nobvious attempt to justify the steer<br />\nrampant on the drawing. But this<br />\nscreaming weakness is decidedly<br />\novershadowed by the quality of a<br />\nbook, on the whole.<br />\nAnother very outstanding feature<br />\nof the Jay is the symmetrical and<br />\nattractive page layout that may be<br />\nobserved throughout the issue.<br />\nInfluenced, perhaps by criticisms<br />\nof his recent editorials, Don White<br /><br />\nThe NORMAN-REMINGTON CO.<br />\nhas left off his program of moral<br />\nMAIN STORE,347 N.CHARLESST<br />\nuplift and reform on the campus and<br />\nranch Barpia, 1217 N.

Fisher, dean and<br />\nprofessor of History at Roberts<br />\nCollege in Constantinople, in a lecture on \"The Problem of Occident<br />\nand Orient\", delivered last Thursday afternoon as one of the Schouler lectures.<br />\nDr. Fisher who has been connected with Roberts College for the past<br />\nfifteen years, discussed the problems affecting East and West in regard to the establishment of good<br />\nwill between them. \"The West<br />\nshould realize the disastrousness<br />\nof force to its financial interests in<br />\nthe East,\" said Dr. Fisher. \"In<br />\nAsia the Asiatics have prior claims<br />\nwhich they must make good by war<br />\nIf not by peace. The West must<br />\ntecognize these claims as being just,<br />\nif amicable relations are to exist<br />\nbetween Orient and Occident.<br />\nWestern peoples must practice<br />\nequality and recognize the cultural<br />\nand religious merits of the East.<br />\nBy so doing we would do away with<br />\nthose cankers and danger spots that<br />\nmar our relations today.\"<br />\nWest Needs Leadership<br /><br />\nThe West needs a new type of<br />\nleadership to send to the East. It<br />\nshould send men of greater sympathy and breadth if the two great<br />\nportions of the world are to build<br />\non a basis of confidence. Contacts<br />\nin the past have been too much on<br />\nthe basis of unmitigated force. The<br />\nEasterners, therefore, find it difficult to understand us. Turkish Nationalists who succeeded in gaining<br />\nfreedom from European dominion<br />\nat Lausanne are still suspicious.<br />\nThough Turkey had great need of<br />\nrailroads, she refused the help of<br />\nforeign capital and said she would<br />\nhave no more of foreign concessions. \"We feel,\" Dr. Fisher pointed out, \"that the East thinks everything we have is beautiful, that the<br />\nEast needs us.\" Such an idea is<br />\ndecidedly erroneous. Turkish Nationalists who instituted a prohibition movement soon after the Great<br />\nWar were unable to make any<br />\nprogress until after the evacuation<br />\nof the Allied troops because of their<br />\ndetrimental influence. The West is<br />\nnot always beautiful or necessary..<br />\nExploitation Must Cease<br /><br />\nExploitation must be ceased. We<br />\nmust cease to use Eastern lands for<br />\nWestern benefit and must give up<br />\ncolonies held by force or markets<br />\nwhich are not on a co-operative<br />\nbasis. Extra-territorial rights for<br />\nforeigners must be surrendered as<br />\nthey have been in Turkey. When,<br />\nunder the terms of the Treaty of<br />\nLausanne, European powers gave<br />\nup these rights, they became subject to the law of the land and were<br />\nno longer exempt from taxation or<br />\ncustom duties. Consequently, these<br />\nforeigners live on the same basis as<br />\nthe Turk and have no unfair advantage over him which they for- merly possessed. Finally, the West<br />\nmust adopt a morle tolerant approach to the religion of the East,<br />\nremembering that it has its merits<br />\nthough it be non-Christian. The<br />\nEast, on the other hand, \"must<br />\nlearn adaptibility rather than mere<br />\nslavish copying,\" said Dr. Fisher. It<br />\nmust discard what hinders its progress just as Turkey has abolished<br />\nthe Sultanate, the Califfate, and the<br />\nfundamental law of the Koran, es(Continued on Page 4, Column 1)<br /><br />\nElections for President of the<br />\nStudent Council and delegates to<br />\nthe A.
