Yonr house\u2014<br />\nand, of course, all the other houses in your town\u2014has wires<br />\nleading to the municipal power plant, pipes leading to the municipal water supply and gas main. So you will find when you<br />\nstart rolling your house to college that you are, willy-nilly,<br />\ndragging all the other houses in town with you. This will result<br />\nin gross population shifts and will make the Bureau of the<br />\nCensus cross as bears.<br />\nNo,I'm afraid that taking your house to college is not feasible. The thing to do, then, is to make your campus lodgings as<br />\nclose a replica of your home as possible.<br />\nAdorn your quarters with familiar objects, things that will<br />\nconstantly remind you of home. Your brother Sam,for instance.<br />\nOr your citizenship papers. Or a carton of Niarlboros.<br />\nThere is nothing like Marlboros, dear friends, to make you<br />\nfeel completely at home. They're so easy, so friendly, so welcome,so likable. The filter is great. The flavor is marvelous. The<br />\nFlip-Top Box is wonderful. The tattoo is optional.<br />\nDecorating your diggings with familiar objects is an excellent<br />\nremedy for homesickness, but it is not without its hazards.<br />\nTake, for instance, the case of Tignor Sigafoos and Estabrook<br />\nRaunch who were assigned to share a room last fall in the<br />\nfreshman dorm.<br />\nTignor, an ice-skating addict from Minnesota, brought with<br />\nhim 44 barrels over which he had jumped the previous winter<br />\nto win the Minnesota Jumping-Over-Barrels Championship.<br />\nEstabrook, a history major from Massachusetts, brought<br />\nPlymouth Rock.<br />\nWell sir, there was simply not enough room for 44 barrels and\u2022<br />\nPlymouth Rock too. Tignor and Estabrook fell into such a violent quarrel that the entire dorm'was kept awake for twelve<br />\ndays and twelve nights.

I refer,<br />\nof course, to homesickness.<br />\nIt is enough to rend the heart, walking along a campus at<br />\nnight and listening to entire dormitories sobbing themselves to<br />\nsleep.

Well sir, the<br />\nobvious solution is for the student to put his home on rollers<br />\nand bring it to college with him. This, however, presents three<br />\nserious problems:<br />\n1) It is likely to play hob with your wine cellar; many wines,<br />\nas we all know, will not travel.<br /><br />\nBECKERS<br />\nAT<br /><br />\n31st &amp; GREENMOUNT<br />\nBE-5-1896<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nsiEPoiediala roba9eifftvh<br /><br />\nEver meet a trusting soul?<br />\n\"You can't go wrong looking for a job these days,\" he<br />\nassures you. \"Opportunities are great all over. All the good<br />\ncompanies have about the same to offer.\"<br />\nDo they? A lot of not-so-trusting souls think otherwise.<br />\nThey suspect that some companies have much more to offer<br />\nthan others, and they want to find out which those are.<br />\nWe'll help. We want to tell you how much the Bell Telephone Companies offer in the way of advancement opportunities, training, pay and benefits, professional associates<br />\nand working conditions.

You can also get information about the careers<br />\nthese companies offer by reading the Bell Telephone booklet<br />\non file in your Placement Office, or by writing for \"Challenge<br />\nand Opportunity\" to:<br /><br />\nte(<br /><br />\n2) There is the matter of getting your house through the<br />\nHolland Tunnel, which has a clearance of only 14 feet, 8 inches.<br />\nThis, of course, is ample for ranch houses, but quite impossible<br />\nfor Cape Cods, Georgians, and Saltboxes, and I, for one, think<br />\nit would be a flagrant injustice to deny higher education to<br />\nstudents from Cape Cod, Georgia, and Saltbox. \u2022<br />\n3) There is the question of public utilities. Yonr house\u2014<br />\nand, of course, all the other houses in your town\u2014has wires<br />\nleading to the municipal power plant, pipes leading to the municipal water supply and gas main. So you will find when you<br />\nstart rolling your house to college that you are, willy-nilly,<br />\ndragging all the other houses in town with you. This will result<br />\nin gross population shifts and will make the Bureau of the<br />\nCensus cross as bears.<br />\nNo,I'm afraid that taking your house to college is not feasible. The thing to do, then, is to make your campus lodgings as<br />\nclose a replica of your home as possible.<br />\nAdorn your quarters with familiar objects, things that will<br />\nconstantly remind you of home. Your brother Sam,for instance.<br />\nOr your citizenship papers. Or a carton of Niarlboros.<br />\nThere is nothing like Marlboros, dear friends, to make you<br />\nfeel completely at home. They're so easy, so friendly, so welcome,so likable. The filter is great. The flavor is marvelous. The<br />\nFlip-Top Box is wonderful. The tattoo is optional.<br />\nDecorating your diggings with familiar objects is an excellent<br />\nremedy for homesickness, but it is not without its hazards.<br />\nTake, for instance, the case of Tignor Sigafoos and Estabrook<br />\nRaunch who were assigned to share a room last fall in the<br />\nfreshman dorm.<br />\nTignor, an ice-skating addict from Minnesota, brought with<br />\nhim 44 barrels over which he had jumped the previous winter<br />\nto win the Minnesota Jumping-Over-Barrels Championship.<br />\nEstabrook, a history major from Massachusetts, brought<br />\nPlymouth Rock.<br />\nWell sir, there was simply not enough room for 44 barrels and\u2022<br />\nPlymouth Rock too. Tignor and Estabrook fell into such a violent quarrel that the entire dorm'was kept awake for twelve<br />\ndays and twelve nights. Finally the Dean of Men was called in<br />\nto adjudicate the dispute.
