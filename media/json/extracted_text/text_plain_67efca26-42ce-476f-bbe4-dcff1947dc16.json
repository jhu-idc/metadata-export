We are glad to say, however, that ninety-five per<br />\ncent, of the criticism received comes from that class who talk a<br />\ngreat deal and function rarely.<br />\nThe most common criticism of our sheet has been the objection to the large proportion of advertising matter. Comparison with<br />\nour exchanges, however, reveals the fact that there are fewer than<br />\nfive, among the hundred or more college sheets, which have less<br />\nadvertising space than our paper. In some instances the ad matter<br />\ncovers two entire pages, leaving one page for notices and the front<br />\nof the sheet for news. The ad is, of course, the heart's blood of the<br />\npublication, as the news is the meat. Without the advertiser the<br />\npaper could not exist.<br />\nWe realize that criticism of the work of the editorial staff is at<br />\ntimes justified. But we would like to call to the attention of our<br />\ncritics the fact that the half-dozen men who spend from eight to<br />\ntwelve hours per week at work upon the paper are not experts and<br />\nare only human; and, furthermore, that anyone of them will retire<br />\nin favor of a better man.

Upon the impression that<br />\nthese athletes carry back to their institutions depends, to a large<br />\nextent, the future of Hopkins.<br />\nThe City of Baltimore, with its six or eight thousand male<br />\nhigh school students, offers as excellent a field for selection of university material as any college could desire. The director of athletics<br />\nat this University has stated that with the material turned out at the<br />\ntwo leading local prep. schools at his disposal, he could develop<br />\n'athletic teams to compete with any in the country.<br />\nThe students who crowd our tennis courts, track and baseball,<br />\nand lacrosse fields can learn little from the University officially as to<br />\nwhat we have here to attract students seeking higher education. The<br />\nattractive buildings and wonderful athletic facilities speak for themselves, but it remains for the Hopkins man to show these guests that<br />\nthere is as real a spirit here at Hopkins as exists at any wide-awake<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nAs our guests, and as prospective students, it is our duty to make<br />\nthe youngsters feel at home. If we could but develop a keener feeling of friendship between them and ourselves it would not be long<br />\n_before this university became the goal of every high school student<br />\nin Baltimore.<br />\nAs it is, we draw a maximum number from this city.
