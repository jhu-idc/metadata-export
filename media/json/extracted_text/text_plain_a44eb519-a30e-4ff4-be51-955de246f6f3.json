He was a<br />\nclose friend of George Washington, at whose house he was a frequent guest. It is interesting to note<br />\nthat at the time of the closest intimacy between Washington and<br />\nThornton, a constant visitor to the<br />\nWashington home was Harriet<br />\nChew, who, as Mrs. Carroll, Jr.,<br />\nwas the first mistress of Homewood. At the same time, Charles<br />\nCarroll, Jr., also was often a recipient of Washington's hospitality.<br />\nThrough Washington the first inhabitants of Homewood probably<br />\nbecame interested in each other and<br />\ndeveloped an interest in Dr. Thornton, the designer of their home. Dr.<br />\nThornton's ability as an architect<br />\nwas recognized by Washington as<br />\nwell as the Carrolls, for the construction of the homes of two of<br />\nWashington's relatives was intrusted to him.<br />\n<br />\n\"Dear Old Johnny Hopkins\"<br />\nThe contents of a circular letter sent<br />\nout in the interest of the candidacy of<br />\nHoward W.

The building is a fairly long, rectangular<br />\nstructure built into the side of one<br />\nof Homewood's many small hills.<br />\nIt is symmetrical in its details; at<br />\neach'end\u2014a low, sloping roof covers a little room. In each of its<br />\nlonger sides the windows are perfectly spaced and a double door<br />\nopens out at the level of the ground.<br />\nPerched in the center of the spine<br />\nof its gabled roof is a white pigeon<br />\ntower surmounted by a weather<br />\nvane. Within, the original massive<br />\nwooden rafters still are uncovered<br />\nand much of the wood still is held<br />\nfirmly in place by hammered nails<br />\nand hand-threaded bolts\u2014reminders of an artisan age. The changes<br />\nnecessary to adapt the building for<br />\nacademic uses have not destroyed<br />\nits original charm.<br />\nThe estate passed into the hands<br />\nof Mr. Wyman, who rented it to<br />\nthe Country School (the present<br />\nGilman Country School). Later the<br />\nCarroll buildings came into the possession of the university through<br />\nthe gift of Mr. Wyman, and when<br />\nthe university established itself at<br />\nHomewood the Barn became a student activities building. The ground<br />\nfloor was turned into a cafeteria;<br />\nthe second floor was used as a student recreation room with provisions for the offices of the various<br />\nstudent publications, and the attic,<br />\nat first a storeroom, later was<br />\nturned over to the Barnstormers as a<br />\nplace to build and store scenery. In<br />\n1929, the completion of the new<br />\nstudent activities building, Levering<br />\nHall, left the barn untenanted save<br />\nfor the Barnstormers. The university administration, at the request<br />\nof the Barnstormers' Club, gave<br />\nthis organization permission to use<br />\nthe upper two floors of the Barn as<br />\na studio.<br />\nRemodeling Begun<br />\n<br />\nLast year a surplus in the club's<br />\ntreasury coupled with an appropriation from the university permitted<br />\nthe Barnstormers to contemplate renovating the barn. Work was<br />\nstarted immediately and at the end<br />\nof two months the second floor had<br />\nbeen remodeled in Tudor style.<br />\nPanels were run around the walls,<br />\na balcony was installed at one end<br />\nof the building and draperies that<br />\nenrich the interior were hung. The<br />\npanels are a rich brown and the<br />\nwalls a cream and the colors, together with the draperies and the<br />\nfurniture, give warmth to an otherwise big bare room. The remodeled<br />\nBarn was opened to the scrutiny of<br />\nthe campus at a dance on March 13,<br />\nthe Barnstormers' open house day.<br />\nThe additional facilities provided<br />\nby the new quarters has inspired the<br />\nclub itself to branch out 12.ts) new<br />\nfields.

Constantly interspersed in the brief<br />\nparagraphs are remarks that subtly<br />\nindicate clandstine (or supposedly<br />\nclandestine) pleasures, revealing<br />\nthat the committee understands the<br />\nworkings of the undergraduate<br />\nmind. Two examples of this type<br />\nof advertising appear in the writeups of the Cabaret Party in Levering Hall, and the boat-ride on the<br />\n\"Annapolis.\" In the former, a<br />\nphrase reads as follows: \"Gingerale will be sold at reasonable prices<br />\nfor a change, and in the latter The<br />\nmoon will still be in good condition,<br />\nbut various amusements will be on<br />\nboard for those who need them.\"<br />\nHowever, the description of the<br />\nSenior Ball is the most high pressured example of ad writing. This<br />\nevent is the feature of the entire<br />\nweek, with Guy Lombardo and his<br />\nRoyal Canadians supplying the<br />\nmusic.

Every student should, as<br />\nearly as possible in his College life,<br />\ndecide what he wishes to do, and<br />\nthen should not be diverted by<br />\ntrivial matters. Every student, as<br />\nsoon as he enters, should determine<br />\nto become interested in some field<br />\nof scholarly endeavor, and should,<br />\nas soon as possible, pass from the<br />\nstage of boyhood to manhood. It<br />\nis a great mistake for a student to<br />\nthink of himself as a member of<br />\na limited group, such as a class. He<br />\nshould think of himself as a member of the whole student body.

But inside, the<br />\nsecond floor, which is also the main<br />\nfloor, has been redecorated in the<br />\nTudor style to provide a studio for<br />\nthe Hopkins dramatic club, which<br />\nbears appropriately enough, the<br />\nname Barnstormers.<br />\nA long and interesting history attaches to this ancient structure.<br />\nCharles Carroll of Carrollton, the<br />\nsigner, gave Homewood to his son,<br />\nCharles, as a wedding present and<br />\nthe buildings were started somewhere between 1798 and 1800. At<br />\nleast nine years expired before<br />\nHomewood was completed. There<br />\nexists a letter of the elder Charles<br />\nwritten to his son in 1808, complaining about the continual expense of<br />\nconstruction. The Carrolls evidently lived there in 1801 because it was<br />\nat Homewood that their first child<br />\nwas born.<br />\nA Social Center<br /><br />\nA QUESTION of great interest<br />\nand importance is what is the responsibility of a College or University, as an educational institution, in<br />\nthe field of non-scholastic activities? It is obvious that in accepting young men from high schools<br />\nand fitting schools, the University<br />\nassumes a certain responsibility towards other things than particularly educational and class-room subjects. Students of all ages should<br />\nbe encouraged to form groups and<br />\nclubs for various purposes, to<br />\nwrite, to act, to take part in musical<br />\nproductions, to play games, and so<br />\non. Many of these activities may<br />\nbe left, and should be left, to the<br />\nstudents themselves, but the question still remains, and I hope to say<br />\nmore about it later.<br /><br />\nOther letters show that the Carroll estate was the center of much<br />\nof the social activity of the surrounding country and a meeting<br />\nplace for people of considerable so-.<br />\ncial, financial and military importance.

He was a<br />\nclose friend of George Washington, at whose house he was a frequent guest. It is interesting to note<br />\nthat at the time of the closest intimacy between Washington and<br />\nThornton, a constant visitor to the<br />\nWashington home was Harriet<br />\nChew, who, as Mrs. Carroll, Jr.,<br />\nwas the first mistress of Homewood. At the same time, Charles<br />\nCarroll, Jr., also was often a recipient of Washington's hospitality.<br />\nThrough Washington the first inhabitants of Homewood probably<br />\nbecame interested in each other and<br />\ndeveloped an interest in Dr. Thornton, the designer of their home.

Later the<br />\nCarroll buildings came into the possession of the university through<br />\nthe gift of Mr. Wyman, and when<br />\nthe university established itself at<br />\nHomewood the Barn became a student activities building. The ground<br />\nfloor was turned into a cafeteria;<br />\nthe second floor was used as a student recreation room with provisions for the offices of the various<br />\nstudent publications, and the attic,<br />\nat first a storeroom, later was<br />\nturned over to the Barnstormers as a<br />\nplace to build and store scenery. In<br />\n1929, the completion of the new<br />\nstudent activities building, Levering<br />\nHall, left the barn untenanted save<br />\nfor the Barnstormers.

Constantly interspersed in the brief<br />\nparagraphs are remarks that subtly<br />\nindicate clandstine (or supposedly<br />\nclandestine) pleasures, revealing<br />\nthat the committee understands the<br />\nworkings of the undergraduate<br />\nmind. Two examples of this type<br />\nof advertising appear in the writeups of the Cabaret Party in Levering Hall, and the boat-ride on the<br />\n\"Annapolis.\" In the former, a<br />\nphrase reads as follows: \"Gingerale will be sold at reasonable prices<br />\nfor a change, and in the latter The<br />\nmoon will still be in good condition,<br />\nbut various amusements will be on<br />\nboard for those who need them.\"<br />\nHowever, the description of the<br />\nSenior Ball is the most high pressured example of ad writing. This<br />\nevent is the feature of the entire<br />\nweek, with Guy Lombardo and his<br />\nRoyal Canadians supplying the<br />\nmusic.
