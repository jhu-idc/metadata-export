Myriad inferences are possible thereafter, but one or two are<br />\ntruly worthy of serious consideration.<br />\nThe statistical report is especially noteworthy. The<br />\nfreshmen class has been subjected to more diverse<br />\npropaganda on the system than any other. In detail<br />\nand with system, all phases of operation, all concepts<br />\nof basis, all aspects of function were demonstrated<br />\nand explained. Results might be expected to be forthcoming. In the freshman class, one might expect the<br />\nslip system to work best.<br />\nNow a perusal of facts: up to the time of the report, not one slip had been tendered. One of two obvious possibilities is presented: the honor system is<br />\nworking perfectly, or the system is not\u2014students are<br />\nnot doing their part in reporting violations.<br />\nThe figures force us to the latter conclusion. Of<br />\nthe 55 freshmen interviewed (a good cross-section of<br />\nthe class) 32 were hesitant or negative as regarded<br />\nusing the slips, 16 gave no comment, and only 6 were<br />\ndefinitely with the system.<br />\nCan it be hoped that any man would report a violation when only 6 of the system's supposedly rabid<br />\nsupporters will issue even an anonymous warning?<br />\nThe Commission's plan for cross-sectioning campus<br />\nopinion as regards the system is a wise one. The difficulties are many, chief among which is the lack of a<br />\nbase from which to gauge results. The showings however, should be most interesting when compiled.<br />\nWe do not believe that the, outlook is a particularlg<br />\ndark one\u2014certainly not so dark as might appear at<br />\nfirst blush. And we agree with some Commission members that violations are probably at an all time low.<br />\nHowever, further moves are impossible without an<br />\nevaluation of present status. When the students have<br />\nvoiced their opinions, and the figures are checked,<br />\nperhaps we shall know better. Time and work can best<br />\ntell.<br />\nMeanwhile, we still take our stand for the system.<br />\nTo our mind it is the only intelligent, mature plan.<br />\nBut it is, of course, dependent on cooperation.<br />\nWhen the time comes to face the facts squarely,<br />\nlet us do so.<br />\n<br />\nHonor system:<br />\na gloomy<br />\nnote<br />\n<br />\nPresident Roosevelt's<br />\nnomination of Professor<br />\nFelix Frankfurter for the<br />\nSupreme Court last week<br />\nbrought to all us lovers of<br />\nfreedom and democracy a<br />\nwelcome relief from the<br />\nnow too prevalent notes of bigotry and reaction.

He is a<br />\nmature scholar with a thorough-going understanding<br />\nof the traditions, as well as needs, of American life.<br />\nMoreover, he has for nearly two years been the leading<br />\nchoice of lawyers throughout the country for the appointment, as a survey by the American Institute of<br />\nPublic Opinion has proven. The day after the nomination editorial comment throughout the country hailed<br />\nthe selection as \"best choice\".<br />\nBut the hearings on Frankfurter's nomination<br />\nwhich are being held this week before a judiciary subcommittee of the Senate have filled us with mixed<br />\n<br />\nDaniel in<br />\nthe lions'<br />\nden<br />\n<br />\nemotions of satisfaction and disgust. Of the inquiry<br />\nitself we certainly approve wholeheartedly. For the<br />\nAmerican public certainly has the right to inquire into<br />\nthe record and philosophy of a man who is to take a<br />\nplace in the highest court of the country. And certainly<br />\na man's philosophy and record are important when it<br />\nis a question of handing down a decision on our very<br />\nvague constitution.<br />\nHowever, the present judiciary inquiry has let<br />\nloose a storm of prejudice and bigotry, prejudice and<br />\nbigotry that are only allowed voice by the liberalism<br />\nthey seek to destroy. Presidents and secretaries of the<br />\n\"save America\" type institutions have come before the<br />\nSenators and have objected to Professor Frankfurter<br />\non the grounds of communism, alien-mindedness, and<br />\ndestructive opinions. Subtle objections have been raised<br />\nin connection with racial affiliations. *The calibre of<br />\nsuch objectors are well typified by one Mr Redd, national director of the Constitutional Crusaders of<br />\n,America. When asked as to meetings, dues, and other<br />\naffairs of his organization, Mr Redd stated, \"I amithe<br />\nwhole works myself.\"<br />\nProfessor Frankfurter is in Washington now before<br />\nthe subcommittee. We know that he will make short<br />\nwork of the absurd, yet serious, charges which have<br />\nbeen laid before him.<br />\nThere are many things<br />\nthat make the cause of peace<br />\nand democracy look pretty<br />\nhopeless these days. And<br />\nthere is no worse sign of<br />\nimpending disaster than the<br />\ntendency of the very people who have hitherto led in the fight for peace to<br />\nclimb on the bandwagon of the advocates of a \"good<br />\nand just\" war.<br />\nWe have at hand a clear example of just that<br />\ntendency in the latest convention of the American Student Union. Persons familiar with the student progressive movement will remember the A S U's origin, and<br />\nits past leadership in opposing militarism and war.<br />\nThat leadership is now simply a part of tradition.<br />\nFor the A S U has clearly demonstrated that it is no<br />\nlonger interested in the anti-war movement. The<br />\nresolutions that have come out of the convention are<br />\nbad enough in themselves. They express unequivocal<br />\nsupport of the concept of 'collective security\" and of<br />\nthe program of national defense. The fight against<br />\nR 0 T C is abandoned to a few shabby cliches about<br />\ndemocracy. The \"peace\" resolution is crowned by<br />\npoint seven, which \"welcomes the announcement . . .<br />\nof an experimental program in the training of student<br />\npilots and the appropriation of $100,000 . . . We<br />\nbelieve that it should be an integral part of the N Y A<br />\nprogram.\"<br />\nBut the weasel words of a formal resolution dont<br />\ngo far enough in explaining the spirit of the convention. Far more revealing is this statement by Howard<br />\nLee, southern secretary of the Union, which might<br />\nhave been literally translated from the German of<br />\nGeneral Goering: \"The people of the South need homes<br />\nand schools, but they prefer battleships because of the<br />\nworld situation. To-day, we need battleships instead!\"<br />\nThe real keynote was struck by Bert Witt, the New<br />\nYork city secretary in these words: \"The time has come<br />\nwhen democracy must be saved not by schools, but by<br />\nguns.\"<br />\nIt is perfectly plain that no organization whcise leaders can talk like that deserves a place in any genuine<br />\npeace movement. The A S U program offers no basis<br />\nfor cooperation on the part of men of good will, and<br />\nis, in point of fact, a very real threat to their hopes.<br />\nThe fight for peace must go on. But, it can only<br />\nbe carried on by militant uncompromising liberalism<br />\nwhich smites the strong and succors the weak without<br />\nregard for soul-sapping expediency. And such a liberal_<br />\nism is not to be found within hailing distance of the<br />\nA S U.<br />\n<br />\nThe ASU<br />\ngoes forth<br />\nto war<br />\n<br />\nTime and time again the<br />\neditorial columns of the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER have been<br />\nfilled with urgent pleas to<br />\nthe University for baseball<br />\nfields, swimming pools,<br />\nreading periods, or other<br />\nfacilities. Once more we would like to put in a plea<br />\nfor the swimming team, who find countless obstacles<br />\nin their way to swimming success.<br />\nBut we want to know when the swimming team<br />\ncomes in on this grand set-up. In previous years the<br />\nteam has practiced at a 14earby high school, a fitting<br />\nplace for a college team to practice. This year even<br />\nthe pool at City college is closed to the mermen, and<br />\nthey must travel down town for practice. In addition<br />\nsome practices have to be at night, at the convenience<br />\nof the pool owners. Not only is interest killed before it<br />\nhas a chance to awaken, but men must spend half their<br />\ntime getting to and from the pool. When schQols are<br />\nalready prepared for their meets, Hopkins has yet to<br />\nhave its first practice.<br />\nFrom every angle swimming justifies the propr<br />\nsupport of the school authorities. It is a healthful and<br />\nimportant activity. Despite previous difficulties past<br />\nteams have been able to compile favorable, if not<br />\nchampionship records. Certainly, the Hopkins swimming team deserves a break and a new swimming pool.<br />\n<br />\nVoices from<br />\nthe<br />\ndeep<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,<br />\n<br />\nBuskin<br />\n<br />\nExam Schedule<br />\n<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\nThe morning sessions begin at 9<br />\nam; the afternoon session at 1 pm.<br />\nThe time allowed is as follows: in a<br />\nthree or four-hour course, thre hours;<br />\nin a one or two-hour course, two<br />\nhours.<br />\n<br />\nSock<br />\nAlbert Reisield<br />\n<br />\nMonday Morning, January 23<br />\n<br />\nHerbert Kleinfield, guest writer<br />\n<br />\nAlternating Current Theory<br />\nM 217<br />\nElectrical Section<br />\nM 218<br />\nMechancial Section<br />\nChemistry 1C<br />\nR<br />\n1<br />\n(A \u2014 0)<br />\nR101<br />\n(P \u2014 Z)<br />\nR 221<br />\nChemistry 700<br />\nM 220<br />\nElectrical Measurements<br />\nM 104<br />\nGas Engineering<br />\nPhysics 1C<br />\nL 120, M 110, Ro. 58<br />\nPolitical Economy 10<br />\n314<br />\n(Dr Deupree)<br />\n312<br />\nPolitical Economy 14B<br />\n311<br />\nPolitical Science 20<br />\n307<br />\nSanitary Engineering<br />\n117<br />\nTheory of Strctures<br />\nMain Lib<br />\nZoology 5P<br />\nMonday Afternoon, January 23<br />\nMilitary<br />\nMilitary<br />\nMilitary<br />\nMilitary<br />\n<br />\nScience, Basic 1....South Loft<br />\nM 221<br />\nScience, Basic 2<br />\nScience, Adv 1 ..North Loft<br />\nScience, Adv 2 _North Loft<br />\n<br />\nTuesday Morning, January 24<br />\nM 109 & M 221<br />\nHeat Engines<br />\nM 110<br />\nIndustrial Organization<br />\nMathematics 1C<br />\nR<br />\n1<br />\nMr I S Cohen<br />\n1<br />\nR<br />\nDr Morrill<br />\nRo 58<br />\nMr Muhly<br />\nR<br />\n1<br />\nMr Seidenberg<br />\nMathematics 20<br />\nR 101<br />\nMr Duncan<br />\nRo 104<br />\nMr Ginberg<br />\nR 101<br />\nMr Hussong<br />\nRo 100<br />\nMr Knudsen<br />\nM 220<br />\nDr. Schilling<br />\nRo 102<br />\nDr Van Kampen<br />\nDr Williamson<br />\nRo 101<br />\nMathematics 30<br />\nMr Duncan<br />\nR 101<br />\nMr Ginberg<br />\nRo 104<br />\nR 101<br />\nMr Hussong<br />\nMr Knudsen<br />\nRo 100<br />\n1<br />\nDr Morrill<br />\nR<br />\nDr Zariski<br />\nRo 58<br />\n<br />\nThose last few idle days gave us<br />\nan opportunity for a first-hand examination of Broadway's theatrical offerings for the current season.

The latter is the<br />\npossessor of a fine orchestra and his<br />\npopularity has been increasing<br />\nsteadily.<br />\nThe committee has gone ahead,<br />\nhowever, with the other necessary<br />\npreparations for the affair.

Myriad inferences are possible thereafter, but one or two are<br />\ntruly worthy of serious consideration.<br />\nThe statistical report is especially noteworthy. The<br />\nfreshmen class has been subjected to more diverse<br />\npropaganda on the system than any other. In detail<br />\nand with system, all phases of operation, all concepts<br />\nof basis, all aspects of function were demonstrated<br />\nand explained. Results might be expected to be forthcoming. In the freshman class, one might expect the<br />\nslip system to work best.<br />\nNow a perusal of facts: up to the time of the report, not one slip had been tendered. One of two obvious possibilities is presented: the honor system is<br />\nworking perfectly, or the system is not\u2014students are<br />\nnot doing their part in reporting violations.<br />\nThe figures force us to the latter conclusion. Of<br />\nthe 55 freshmen interviewed (a good cross-section of<br />\nthe class) 32 were hesitant or negative as regarded<br />\nusing the slips, 16 gave no comment, and only 6 were<br />\ndefinitely with the system.<br />\nCan it be hoped that any man would report a violation when only 6 of the system's supposedly rabid<br />\nsupporters will issue even an anonymous warning?<br />\nThe Commission's plan for cross-sectioning campus<br />\nopinion as regards the system is a wise one. The difficulties are many, chief among which is the lack of a<br />\nbase from which to gauge results. The showings however, should be most interesting when compiled.<br />\nWe do not believe that the, outlook is a particularlg<br />\ndark one\u2014certainly not so dark as might appear at<br />\nfirst blush. And we agree with some Commission members that violations are probably at an all time low.<br />\nHowever, further moves are impossible without an<br />\nevaluation of present status. When the students have<br />\nvoiced their opinions, and the figures are checked,<br />\nperhaps we shall know better. Time and work can best<br />\ntell.<br />\nMeanwhile, we still take our stand for the system.<br />\nTo our mind it is the only intelligent, mature plan.<br />\nBut it is, of course, dependent on cooperation.<br />\nWhen the time comes to face the facts squarely,<br />\nlet us do so.<br /><br />\nHonor system:<br />\na gloomy<br />\nnote<br /><br />\nPresident Roosevelt's<br />\nnomination of Professor<br />\nFelix Frankfurter for the<br />\nSupreme Court last week<br />\nbrought to all us lovers of<br />\nfreedom and democracy a<br />\nwelcome relief from the<br />\nnow too prevalent notes of bigotry and reaction. Professor Frankfurter has always impressed us with his<br />\nliberalism, integrity, and ability to fulfill the position<br />\nleft open by the death of Justice Cardoza. He is a<br />\nmature scholar with a thorough-going understanding<br />\nof the traditions, as well as needs, of American life.<br />\nMoreover, he has for nearly two years been the leading<br />\nchoice of lawyers throughout the country for the appointment, as a survey by the American Institute of<br />\nPublic Opinion has proven. The day after the nomination editorial comment throughout the country hailed<br />\nthe selection as \"best choice\".<br />\nBut the hearings on Frankfurter's nomination<br />\nwhich are being held this week before a judiciary subcommittee of the Senate have filled us with mixed<br /><br />\nDaniel in<br />\nthe lions'<br />\nden<br /><br />\nemotions of satisfaction and disgust. Of the inquiry<br />\nitself we certainly approve wholeheartedly. For the<br />\nAmerican public certainly has the right to inquire into<br />\nthe record and philosophy of a man who is to take a<br />\nplace in the highest court of the country. And certainly<br />\na man's philosophy and record are important when it<br />\nis a question of handing down a decision on our very<br />\nvague constitution.<br />\nHowever, the present judiciary inquiry has let<br />\nloose a storm of prejudice and bigotry, prejudice and<br />\nbigotry that are only allowed voice by the liberalism<br />\nthey seek to destroy. Presidents and secretaries of the<br />\n\"save America\" type institutions have come before the<br />\nSenators and have objected to Professor Frankfurter<br />\non the grounds of communism, alien-mindedness, and<br />\ndestructive opinions. Subtle objections have been raised<br />\nin connection with racial affiliations. *The calibre of<br />\nsuch objectors are well typified by one Mr Redd, national director of the Constitutional Crusaders of<br />\n,America. When asked as to meetings, dues, and other<br />\naffairs of his organization, Mr Redd stated, \"I amithe<br />\nwhole works myself.\"<br />\nProfessor Frankfurter is in Washington now before<br />\nthe subcommittee. We know that he will make short<br />\nwork of the absurd, yet serious, charges which have<br />\nbeen laid before him.<br />\nThere are many things<br />\nthat make the cause of peace<br />\nand democracy look pretty<br />\nhopeless these days. And<br />\nthere is no worse sign of<br />\nimpending disaster than the<br />\ntendency of the very people who have hitherto led in the fight for peace to<br />\nclimb on the bandwagon of the advocates of a \"good<br />\nand just\" war.<br />\nWe have at hand a clear example of just that<br />\ntendency in the latest convention of the American Student Union. Persons familiar with the student progressive movement will remember the A S U's origin, and<br />\nits past leadership in opposing militarism and war.<br />\nThat leadership is now simply a part of tradition.<br />\nFor the A S U has clearly demonstrated that it is no<br />\nlonger interested in the anti-war movement. The<br />\nresolutions that have come out of the convention are<br />\nbad enough in themselves. They express unequivocal<br />\nsupport of the concept of 'collective security\" and of<br />\nthe program of national defense. The fight against<br />\nR 0 T C is abandoned to a few shabby cliches about<br />\ndemocracy. The \"peace\" resolution is crowned by<br />\npoint seven, which \"welcomes the announcement . . .<br />\nof an experimental program in the training of student<br />\npilots and the appropriation of $100,000 . . . We<br />\nbelieve that it should be an integral part of the N Y A<br />\nprogram.\"<br />\nBut the weasel words of a formal resolution dont<br />\ngo far enough in explaining the spirit of the convention. Far more revealing is this statement by Howard<br />\nLee, southern secretary of the Union, which might<br />\nhave been literally translated from the German of<br />\nGeneral Goering: \"The people of the South need homes<br />\nand schools, but they prefer battleships because of the<br />\nworld situation. To-day, we need battleships instead!\"<br />\nThe real keynote was struck by Bert Witt, the New<br />\nYork city secretary in these words: \"The time has come<br />\nwhen democracy must be saved not by schools, but by<br />\nguns.\"<br />\nIt is perfectly plain that no organization whcise leaders can talk like that deserves a place in any genuine<br />\npeace movement. The A S U program offers no basis<br />\nfor cooperation on the part of men of good will, and<br />\nis, in point of fact, a very real threat to their hopes.<br />\nThe fight for peace must go on. But, it can only<br />\nbe carried on by militant uncompromising liberalism<br />\nwhich smites the strong and succors the weak without<br />\nregard for soul-sapping expediency. And such a liberal_<br />\nism is not to be found within hailing distance of the<br />\nA S U.<br /><br />\nThe ASU<br />\ngoes forth<br />\nto war<br /><br />\nTime and time again the<br />\neditorial columns of the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER have been<br />\nfilled with urgent pleas to<br />\nthe University for baseball<br />\nfields, swimming pools,<br />\nreading periods, or other<br />\nfacilities. Once more we would like to put in a plea<br />\nfor the swimming team, who find countless obstacles<br />\nin their way to swimming success.<br />\nBut we want to know when the swimming team<br />\ncomes in on this grand set-up. In previous years the<br />\nteam has practiced at a 14earby high school, a fitting<br />\nplace for a college team to practice. This year even<br />\nthe pool at City college is closed to the mermen, and<br />\nthey must travel down town for practice. In addition<br />\nsome practices have to be at night, at the convenience<br />\nof the pool owners. Not only is interest killed before it<br />\nhas a chance to awaken, but men must spend half their<br />\ntime getting to and from the pool. When schQols are<br />\nalready prepared for their meets, Hopkins has yet to<br />\nhave its first practice.<br />\nFrom every angle swimming justifies the propr<br />\nsupport of the school authorities. It is a healthful and<br />\nimportant activity. Despite previous difficulties past<br />\nteams have been able to compile favorable, if not<br />\nchampionship records. Certainly, the Hopkins swimming team deserves a break and a new swimming pool.<br /><br />\nVoices from<br />\nthe<br />\ndeep<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,<br /><br />\nBuskin<br /><br />\nExam Schedule<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\nThe morning sessions begin at 9<br />\nam; the afternoon session at 1 pm.<br />\nThe time allowed is as follows: in a<br />\nthree or four-hour course, thre hours;<br />\nin a one or two-hour course, two<br />\nhours.<br /><br />\nSock<br />\nAlbert Reisield<br /><br />\nMonday Morning, January 23<br /><br />\nHerbert Kleinfield, guest writer<br /><br />\nAlternating Current Theory<br />\nM 217<br />\nElectrical Section<br />\nM 218<br />\nMechancial Section<br />\nChemistry 1C<br />\nR<br />\n1<br />\n(A \u2014 0)<br />\nR101<br />\n(P \u2014 Z)<br />\nR 221<br />\nChemistry 700<br />\nM 220<br />\nElectrical Measurements<br />\nM 104<br />\nGas Engineering<br />\nPhysics 1C<br />\nL 120, M 110, Ro. 58<br />\nPolitical Economy 10<br />\n314<br />\n(Dr Deupree)<br />\n312<br />\nPolitical Economy 14B<br />\n311<br />\nPolitical Science 20<br />\n307<br />\nSanitary Engineering<br />\n117<br />\nTheory of Strctures<br />\nMain Lib<br />\nZoology 5P<br />\nMonday Afternoon, January 23<br />\nMilitary<br />\nMilitary<br />\nMilitary<br />\nMilitary<br /><br />\nScience, Basic 1....South Loft<br />\nM 221<br />\nScience, Basic 2<br />\nScience, Adv 1 ..North Loft<br />\nScience, Adv 2 _North Loft<br /><br />\nTuesday Morning, January 24<br />\nM 109 &amp; M 221<br />\nHeat Engines<br />\nM 110<br />\nIndustrial Organization<br />\nMathematics 1C<br />\nR<br />\n1<br />\nMr I S Cohen<br />\n1<br />\nR<br />\nDr Morrill<br />\nRo 58<br />\nMr Muhly<br />\nR<br />\n1<br />\nMr Seidenberg<br />\nMathematics 20<br />\nR 101<br />\nMr Duncan<br />\nRo 104<br />\nMr Ginberg<br />\nR 101<br />\nMr Hussong<br />\nRo 100<br />\nMr Knudsen<br />\nM 220<br />\nDr. Schilling<br />\nRo 102<br />\nDr Van Kampen<br />\nDr Williamson<br />\nRo 101<br />\nMathematics 30<br />\nMr Duncan<br />\nR 101<br />\nMr Ginberg<br />\nRo 104<br />\nR 101<br />\nMr Hussong<br />\nMr Knudsen<br />\nRo 100<br />\n1<br />\nDr Morrill<br />\nR<br />\nDr Zariski<br />\nRo 58<br /><br />\nThose last few idle days gave us<br />\nan opportunity for a first-hand examination of Broadway's theatrical offerings for the current season.
