The Council has not even met<br />\nsince all the discussion about activities has been in<br />\nprogress. They themselves have more confidence in<br />\ntheir individual influence than in that of the Council. It is almost impossible for them, in this state of<br />\nmnd, to commit themselves to a sufficiently unified<br />\naction to have any weight with the students. In fact,<br />\ntake any ten men who are not in any way connected<br />\nwith activities, but who are affected because of the<br />\nfee they pay, and at least five of them cannot tell you<br />\nthe difference between the Student Council and the<br />\nStudent Activities Council, or the significance of the<br />\nlatter.<br />\nIn the light of the foregoing considerations we<br />\nare at a loss to see any justification for the Council.<br />\nAt the critical moment in the budget situation last<br />\nyear 0.

The Council has not even met<br />\nsince all the discussion about activities has been in<br />\nprogress. They themselves have more confidence in<br />\ntheir individual influence than in that of the Council. It is almost impossible for them, in this state of<br />\nmnd, to commit themselves to a sufficiently unified<br />\naction to have any weight with the students. In fact,<br />\ntake any ten men who are not in any way connected<br />\nwith activities, but who are affected because of the<br />\nfee they pay, and at least five of them cannot tell you<br />\nthe difference between the Student Council and the<br />\nStudent Activities Council, or the significance of the<br />\nlatter.<br />\nIn the light of the foregoing considerations we<br />\nare at a loss to see any justification for the Council.<br />\nAt the critical moment in the budget situation last<br />\nyear 0.
