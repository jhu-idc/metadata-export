The fraction of<br />\nGNP now spent in this area is<br />\nclose to 10%, Richmond said.<br />\nThis attracts the interest of<br />\nother groups in the economy,<br />\ncreating \"ramifications which go<br />\n<br />\nfar beyond\" the medical sector.<br />\nhe added.<br />\nRichmond said health systems agencies are presently<br />\nplanning to minimize the rate of<br />\nexpenditure in the health care<br />\nindustry, especially in capital<br />\ncosts and construction.

The average life expectancy in the United States is<br />\nnow 733 years, he noted, and<br />\nthe infant mortality rate, an<br />\nindicator of the general level of<br />\n<br />\nhealth care, is the lowest in U.S.<br />\nhistory. The effects of infectious diseases, especially diseases<br />\nof childhood, have been greatly<br />\nreduced, and some diseases, such<br />\nas smallpox, have almost been<br />\neradicated, Richmond said. He<br />\nadded that the total number of<br />\ncases of measles reported in the<br />\nU.S. last week was only 23.<br />\nRichmond said the containment of infectious diseases<br />\nallows health care experts to<br />\nexplore the prevention of death<br />\nby accident or violence.

I<br />\nthought this year's freshmen<br />\nwould eat quality fare. No such<br />\nluck. I was unfortunate enough<br />\nto visit the dorms cafeteria<br />\nWednesday evening to partake of<br />\nthe delicacies slapped onto stillwet plates. Three entrees were<br />\noffered for my dining pleasure:<br />\nroast beef, bacon quiche, and<br />\nshepherd's pie. Whipped potatoes, a choice of vegetables, and<br />\nassorted cakes completed the<br />\nmenu. The beef was the best of<br />\nthe three, even though it was<br />\ntough and fatty. The management made an attempt at<br />\nshepherd's pie. It looked pretty,<br />\nbut tasted bland, and the meat<br />\nwas loaded with filler. The<br />\nquiche was not too bad, but it<br />\nwas cold and its crust was very<br />\nsoggy.<br />\nWhile the quality of the<br />\nentrees is basically unchanged,<br />\nthe vegetables have improved<br />\n<br />\nand the desserts have gotten<br />\neven worse. The vegetables were<br />\nobviously frozen and the potatoes powdered, but the vegetables were not soggy as in the<br />\npast. Both the carrots and the<br />\nmixed vegetables were prepared<br />\nwell. The butter beans were<br />\natrocious - overcooked and<br />\nwaterlogged but living in the<br />\nSouth for seven years has made<br />\nme accustomed to perfect butter<br />\nbeans. The cake was dry and the<br />\nicing consisted of a scrap of<br />\ncolor across the top. The liquid<br />\nin the topping of the pineapple<br />\nupside-down cake had seeped all<br />\nthe way through, making the<br />\ncake quite damp. The other<br />\ndesserts were palatable--it is<br />\ndifficult to harm Jello, whip and<br />\nchill, and fresh oranges. Cold,<br />\ncongealed,lumpy lentil soup was<br />\nalso available.<br />\nSince I only sampled one<br />\nnight's bill of fare, I asked<br />\nseveral freshmen and one houseabout the service<br />\nmaster<br />\nand the quality of other meals.<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\nWhen it's finally Friday afternoon and<br />\nyou're browsing through our Bookcenter<br />\nbecause you can't stand the thought of<br />\nreading Streitweiser and Heathcock before<br />\ngoing out and getting drunk, don't expect<br />\nto find too much in the way of good<br />\nalternatives.<br />\nWhat was once a half-adequate offering<br />\nof magazines has dwindled to a meagre<br />\nand uninteresting collection. The 'general<br />\ninterest' section presents little beyond a<br />\nfew standards of the Ayn Rand variety.<br />\nThe 'seconds' bins offer only 1978 Star<br />\nWars calendars and back copies of Horticulture in Dundalk.

There is also<br />\n<br />\na line of \"Praise the Lord\" postcards, and<br />\neven an offering of children's coloring<br />\nbooks, entitled The Bible Fun Books.<br />\nNow it is obviously futile to rant and<br />\nrave about coercion of minds or censorship. We encourage the distribution of all<br />\nbooks - Christian, radical, or whatever<br />\nelse. There have been examples over the<br />\nlast year where \"leftist\" and \"alternative\"<br />\npublications were denied sale at the store,<br />\nbut we've been told this is no more. The<br />\npoint is not to suppress unusual book<br />\nofferings, but to promote them.

Perhaps your readers<br />\napathy is due to a belief that the<br />\nsituation is hopeless. In the<br />\nchance, however, that you will<br />\ncarefully consider a reader's<br />\nsuggestions, I offer the following<br />\nobservations.<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nThe<br />\ncontinually portrays women in<br />\na sexist light. On October 10,<br />\nyou featured a female computer<br />\nnude and a picture of a woman<br />\nwith her clothes partially torn<br />\noff. Another case in point is<br />\nyour centerfold of October 17,<br />\n\"My Dream,\" a piece unworthy<br />\nto be called journalism, and the<br />\nsexist drawings accompanying it.<br />\nWomen happen to be people<br />\nwho do interesting things on this<br />\ncampus. Why don't you try<br />\nreporting some of them, instead<br />\nof filling valuable space with<br />\npictures and other accounts of<br />\nwomen in chastity belts, women<br />\nwho have been assaulted or<br />\nraped, and women in varying<br />\ndegrees of nudity? I am deeply<br />\noffended by the attitudes .toward women implied by many<br />\nof your pictures and articles.<br />\nIn a more positive vein, I do<br />\nrecognize in your centerfold<br />\ndrawings the clever allusion to<br />\nthe Shriver Hall murals. The<br />\nmurals really are gross, aren't<br />\nthey? Is there anything that can<br />\nbe done to get rid of them?<br />\n<br />\nA number of reported facts in<br />\nyour article were wrong. In<br />\norder to protect the victim I will<br />\nnot be able to fill you in on any<br />\nof the \"juicy gossip\".

Besides<br />\nRuby, there was the well-to-do,<br />\nwhite fourth-grader in Florida<br />\nwho did not want to be rich<br />\nbecause he could not enter<br />\nheaven (he had heard something<br />\nabout the eye of a needle and a<br />\ncamel in church).

Here comes<br />\nthe complaint. Two weeks ago,<br />\na letter from a Goucher student<br />\njustifiably angered at the portrayal of Goucher women as sex<br />\nkittens in Newsletter graphics<br />\nasked why -- if the portrayal is<br />\nan accurate one -- you Hopkins<br />\nmen even bother with them.<br />\nYour answer was \"Need you<br />\ncont, on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nRuthchild,Fischer,Einolf Speak Out<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nask?:: -- or, homonymically.<br />\n\"need your ass.\"<br />\nThough the Newletter is<br />\nnow in the tradition of good<br />\ncollege papers, your editorial<br />\nresponse was in the tradition of<br />\nhumor.<br />\nlocker-room<br />\nsnide<br />\n\"Need you ask?\" was a cheap<br />\nshot. You have an obligation to<br />\nyour female readers, Hopkins<br />\nand Goucher students alike, to<br />\ntreat them with more respect<br />\nthan your response of October<br />\n10th implied.

I realize that Mr. Harris<br />\ngot a little carried away with his<br />\nown sarcastic wit, but let's be<br />\nfair. The Gilman Coffee Shop is<br />\na non-profit, student-run service.<br />\nThe GCS isn't exactly popular<br />\nwith the administration of this<br />\ncampus. Sure, they don't say<br />\nmuch when everything is going<br />\nwell, but we can catch it over<br />\nthe slightest screw-up. We get<br />\nminimal funds and can't afford<br />\nto replace the equipment on a<br />\nyearly basis.<br />\nGeraldine Ruthchild<br />\nAs manager of this year's<br />\nshop, I can assure all interested<br />\nparties that we are making every<br />\n<br />\neffort to get more tables. We are<br />\nall students ourselves and miss<br />\nthe tables as much as anyone.<br />\nYou will have tables soon and<br />\nnot because some sarcastic wit<br />\nfailed to get the facts. All<br />\nthe employees know that tables<br />\nare in the works, just ask.<br />\nAs for being hit by inflation, Mr. Harris failed to note<br />\nthat GCS prices have held for<br />\nthe third straight year. There<br />\nwas a five cent increase in the<br />\nprice of tea, but the price<br />\nof turnovers and eclairs dropped<br />\nby the same amount. We have<br />\nalso expanded our hours from<br />\n8:30 am to 4:30 . We hope this<br />\naffords better service for loyal<br />\npatrons.<br />\nWe appreciate all<br />\nsuggestions, but resent sarcastic<br />\ncriticism that has not been<br />\nsubstantiated by anyone that<br />\nwould know the facts.

At breakfast,<br />\nthe eggs are overcooked, the<br />\nbacon greasy, the pancakes and<br />\nfrench toast leathery, and the<br />\nsyrup far too thick. The continental breakfast consists of<br />\neverything not eaten beforeliand--no fresh pastries are offered and the cereal containers<br />\nare often empty.<br />\nComplaints about the service, especially at lunch, were<br />\nuniversal. The cafeteria runs<br />\nout of silverware and trays<br />\nduring peak times. It then runs<br />\nout of food, forcing students<br />\nto stand in line for as long as<br />\nfifteen minutes until fresh supplies are sent to the serving<br />\nline. Frequently a line forms<br />\noutside; one freshman said she<br />\nwas often forced to wait thirty<br />\nminutes to get her card punched.<br />\nShe said this delay causes<br />\nproblems on days when she has<br />\nonly one hour between classes<br />\nfor lunch. Other complaints are:<br />\nthe ice machines are usually<br />\nempty, the flies are always a<br />\nproblem, the employees are slow<br />\nin refilling empty milk dispensers, and the supply of tea<br />\nIn<br />\nbags is often depleted.<br />\naddition, the dining hall closes<br />\nearly and refuses to put out<br />\nadditional food near closing<br />\ntime. Several people said they<br />\nhad been refused admittance<br />\nbefore the posted closing time<br />\nand others said they were unable<br />\nto enter the cafeteria area to<br />\nobtain second helpings. Also,<br />\nthe food is often cold and tastes<br />\nstale.<br />\nSeveral freshmen were more<br />\nthan willing to offer suggestions.<br />\nThey urged ARA to prepare<br />\nmore basic fare that would be<br />\neasier to cook well and would<br />\nretain flavor and texture for<br />\na longer period of time instead<br />\nof conjuring up intricate gourmet (?) items.<br />\nAlso, they<br />\nsaid, tne management should<br />\nplan more special meals to<br />\nmaintain interest. Most everyone was pleased with the do-ityourself sundaes on Wednesday,<br />\n<br />\nbut the ever-present problem<br />\nof running out of what they call<br />\nfood was in evidence.

That honor was explained. \"Most of the residents will always stay<br />\nreserved for panelist Daniel Greenberg when he told the Democratic, but will vote Republican if there's a good<br />\ncandidates to answer his questions and stop making candidate.\"<br />\nThe students concentrated on distributing<br />\ncampaign speeches.<br />\nliterature and also did some polling.\"Our goal<br />\ncampaign<br />\nEven supporters of the candidates seemed<br />\nunimpressed, although most of the Reagan and Ander-son campaign workers at Hopkins were away at celebrations downtown. Peter Merrill, a freshman History of<br />\nScience major who said he leaned towards voting for<br />\nAnderson, joked that the Illinois congressman \"halfanswered\" a question about the economy. The proportion increased to three-quarters when Anderson responded, to a query about U.S. military strength. After<br />\nAnderson criticized Cardinal Humberto Medieros for<br />\nurging Boston-area Catholics to vote against pro-abortion<br />\ncandidates and restated his own pro-choice position,<br />\nMerrill said,\"Hey, he finally answered one.\"<br />\nNnamdi Ezera, a sophomore Political Science<br />\nmajor from Nigeria and president of the Black Student<br />\nUnion, was disappointed that the candidates failed to<br />\n- address the problems of minorities more directly than<br />\nthey did. \"When they were asked about the cities, they<br />\ntalked about water mains and sewers, not people,\" he<br />\nsaid. He added that he favored President Carter as \"the<br />\nlesser of three evils.\"<br />\nNot all the students expressed discontent with<br />\nthe candidates of the debate.\"They covered most of the<br />\nmajor issues,\" said Bill Donahue,a freshman Engineering<br />\nmajor from upstate New York. One Reagan backer was<br />\npleased with his candidate's performance. \"I expected<br />\nhim to screw up, because he sometimes speaks without<br />\nthinking,\" said Jeff Robinson, a freshman pre-med<br />\nfrom New York City.<br />\nis to pass out as much literature as possible,\" Brown told<br />\nhis troops.

They found<br />\nfor the GOP ticket, 20 students from JHU and Goucher more Reagan than Carter supporters on many of the<br />\nCollege gathered in a Homewood parking lot Saturday blocks they covered, with Anderson far behind. But a<br />\nmarning, October 4, to pass out flyers and canvass. The large number of voters they encountered were still<br />\nvolunteers concentrated their efforts on the Hamilton, undecided. In one area, encompassing parts of Beier<br />\nRoad, Walther Avenue and Moravia Road, Reagan was in<br />\nfront of Carter 12 votes to 10, with two for Anderson<br />\nand 17 undecided. McCall admitted, however, that<br />\nReagan was behind 2-to-1 on the other side of Belair<br />\nRoad. A final tally was unavailable.<br />\n<br />\nmany Reagan buttons around.\" Young Democrats'<br />\npresident Carolyn Hauer disputes Steele's contention.<br />\n\"We've held meetings, stuffed mailboxes, and set up a<br />\ntable in Gilman. We don't have enough buttons to give<br />\neveryone because this is the Democratic Party - we don't<br />\nhave the money to throw around like the Republicans<br />\ndo.<br />\nAlthough some Young Democrats say they plan<br />\nto vote for John Anderson or that they are still trying to<br />\ndecide between Anderson and Carter, Hauer dismisses<br />\nlack of enthusiasm for the party's candidate as a problem in getting students to work for the ticket. \"In any<br />\nelection there are people who aren't thrilled with the<br />\ncandidate, but support him anyway,\" Hauer says. She<br />\nclaims that only \"two or three\" of the Young Democrats' approximately 30 members at Hopkins back<br />\nAnderson.<br />\n\"The Anderson people have worked very hard,\"<br />\nSteele says. \"For example, they brought (Anderson<br />\nrunning mate) Patrick Lucey here to speak.\" However,<br />\nthe Anderson campaign finds fewer uses for student<br />\nvolunteers than it did during the primaries, according to<br />\ncampus coordinator Brian Mirskv, because Anderson's<br />\n<br />\nArea residents were mostly friendly, even those<br />\nwho opposed the Republican ticket. \"As long as you're<br />\nnot Communists,\" one Carter supporter told freshman<br />\nJames Bumbalo. However, one young woman was<br />\nannoyed at being woken up. \"You and Reagan can go<br />\nfuck yourselves,\" she said to Bobb.<br />\nMcCall was pleased with the College Republicans'<br />\nefforts. \"We're getting a more enthusiastic response<br />\nfrom students this time around,\" he said. \"It seems like<br />\nyoungsters are becoming more independent-minded, and<br />\nmore rational. They listen less to rabble-rousers than<br />\nthey used to.\" The Republicans have also canvassed on<br />\ncampus: last Sunday they held a fundraiser in the Glass<br />\nPavillion attended by Senator Charles Mathias and most<br />\nof the GOP's Maryland congressional candidates.<br />\nPrivately, some active Hopkins GOP members<br />\nexpress doubts about Reagan, especially his stands<br />\non abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment, the Panama<br />\nCanal treaty, and arms control. Many supported<br />\nHoward Baker, George Bush, or John Anderson in the<br />\nprimaries. In fact, an in-house debate (with members<br />\ntaking Reagan and Anderson stands) resulted in more<br />\nAnderson than Reagan votes at an informal election<br />\nbased on the debate.<br />\n\"The Young Democrats have done virtually<br />\nnothing on this campus for Carter, while the College<br />\nRepublicans have done a lot for their candidate,\" says<br />\nStudent Council president Michael Steele. \"I've seen so<br />\n<br />\nissues in the campaign directly affect undergraduate<br />\neducation. \"We need a federal agency kke the Department of Education to address problems like the cost and<br />\nquality of schooling, but Reagan wants to abolish it<br />\nbecause he thinks education will take care of itself,\" he<br />\nsays.<br />\n\"Anyone who's here on financial aid should not<br />\nbe voting for Reagan,\" Hauer declares. \"Carter has done<br />\na lot to expand it.\" She pointed to his increase in the<br />\nfamily income ceiling for Basic Educational Opportunity<br />\nGrants. \"Any extreme form of conservatism, such<br />\nas Reagan represents, will be detrimental to financial<br />\naid,\" adds senior Chas Haller, a reluctant Carter supporter.<br />\nSuch fears are based on \"rhetoric, not reality,\"<br />\ncontends Harry Davis, a freshman member of the College<br />\nRepublicans. \"When he was governor of California,<br />\nReagan cut educational spending, but he expanded<br />\nprograms and increased benefits. Reagan is being judged<br />\non rhetoric, not his record.\"<br />\nMembers of the Hopkins Christian Fellowship are<br />\nconcerned with the proportion of the federal spending<br />\nallocated to the military. \"As future bread-winners,<br />\nhomeowners, and taxpayers, the quality of our lives will<br />\nbe affected by the amount of resources devoted to<br />\narms,\" says Fellowship president David Niebuhr. \"As<br />\nChristians we're very reluctant to support the use of<br />\nviolence. Although some of us are for Reagan, we worry<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Christian Fellowship president David Niebuhr<br />\n<br />\nstrategists have decided to concentrate their limited<br />\nresources on television, newspaper, and radio advertising.<br />\nThe College Republicans and the Young Democrats will debate October 28, before the the candidates<br />\nthemselves meet, and they have also scheduled a joint<br />\nelection night party. \"The Democrats and Republicans<br />\nare cooperating and will continue to cooperate,\" Bobb<br />\nsays. \"One of our basic goals is to increase voter awareness and reduce the amount of apathy, while still<br />\nfollowing our respective beliefs.\" Hauer told her group,<br />\n\"It's more important to build interest than to score<br />\npoints off the Republicans, though that would be nice<br />\ntoo.\"<br />\nStudents In General<br />\n\"This campus is not really politically active,\"<br />\nSteele says. \"Students are concerned about the election,<br />\nbut they haven't demonstrated it.\" He believes some<br />\n<br />\n\fthat he's too iron-fisted, that he could get us involved in<br />\na war too easily.\" Haller adds, \"Although Reagan has<br />\nopposed Carter's registration and said he would never<br />\nuse a draft in peacetime, he's never explained what he<br />\nmeant by peacetime. He could use semantics against us.<br />\nI trust Carter more than Reagan, because Carter will<br />\nhave a good reason for using the draft, while Reagan<br />\nmay not.\"<br />\nChris Campbell, a member of the now-defunct<br />\nNew Political Caucus, is more concerned about another<br />\nforeign policy issue\u2014human rights. \"Reagan will relegate human rights to the back seat. For example, he's<br />\nagainst aid to Nicaragua, because he still sees a Communist conspiracy in everything.\"<br />\nPresident Carter does not escape criticism for his<br />\nhandling of foreign affairs. \"Carter has lacked the<br />\nstrength of his convictions to carry out a course of<br />\naction,\" Niebuhr says.\"He's been wishy-washy.\"<br />\nlsiebuhr also feels the candidates haw neglected several<br />\nimportant subjects during the campaign. \"Neither<br />\ncandidate has come out with a moral stand on the<br />\nfamily,\" he says. He cites the \"marriage tax\"\u2014higher<br />\n<br />\nRights Amendment and his advocacy of an amendment<br />\nbanning abortion. \"The situation for women did not get<br />\nbetter under Carter, but it will definitely get worse<br />\nunder Reagan.\" College Republicans who agree with her<br />\non ERA and abortion dispute her contention, maintaining that these are not \"presidential issues\" because the<br />\npresident has no official role in the constitutional<br />\namendment process, and that ERA has been stalled<br />\ndespite Carter's support.<br />\nThe abortion issue is less important to Christian<br />\nFellowship members, according to Niebuhr,even though<br />\nmost of them take the \"pro-life\" stance. \"Reagan's<br />\nposition is better, but it's not a major factor in the<br />\ndecisions of the people in the Fellowship unless the<br />\ncandidates have equal appeal in other areas,\" he says.<br />\nAlthough Fellowship members side with Reagan<br />\nin opposing Medicaidfunding for abortion, they question<br />\nhis commitment to helping the poor. \"Society as a<br />\nwhole has a responsibility towards the disadvantaged, in<br />\nhelping them care for themselves,\" says Niebuhr. \"We<br />\nwonder whether Reagan leans more towards business<br />\ninterests.\" But he also raps Carter for being \"ineffectual<br />\nat dealing with interest 2roups.\"<br />\n<br />\nBlack Student Union nresident Nnamdi Ezera<br />\n19 percent were undecided, and one percent said they<br />\nintended to vote for other candidates.<br />\nA telephone poll taken by the News-Letter<br />\nOctober 21-23 revealed that student attitudes had<br />\nchanged. Here are the results:<br />\nQuestion Number 1: How likely do you feel it is<br />\nthat you will vote in this election?<br />\n(159 responding)<br />\nProbable - 13%<br />\nAnswers: Certain - 49%<br />\nMay Vote - 8% Probably Not - 30%<br />\nQuestion Number 2(asked to those who answelled \"probably not\" to Question Number 1):<br />\nWhich of the following reasons best describes<br />\nwhy you do not expect to vote?<br />\nAnswers: Unable to Register (too young or<br />\nforeign citizens) - 43% Did Not Register - 30%<br />\nDissatisfaction with<br />\nInconvenience - 2%<br />\ncandidate or political system - 26%<br />\n(Figures add up to more than 100% due to<br />\nrounding.)<br />\n<br />\nrates paid by married people than by the unmarried--as<br />\nan example, calling it \"an incentive to live together.\" He<br />\nis also disappointed that the candidates have not discussed such educational issues as federal support for<br />\nprivate institutions and instruction in public schools.<br />\n\"The schools should teach values and standards which<br />\nsupport the traditional family structure,\" he declares.<br />\n-4.<br />\n<br />\nEconomic issues are the major concern of the<br />\nmembers of the Black Student Union,according to BSU<br />\npresident Nnamdi Ezera. He cites unemployment, the<br />\nrevitalization of urban centers, and minority appointments to influential government posts as particular areas<br />\nof interest. He believes the majority of BSU members<br />\nwill vote for Carter \"because the alternative is unthinkable.\"<br />\nThe Anderson Factor<br />\n<br />\nYoung Democrats president Carolyn Hauer<br />\nHailer's group, the Hopkins Gay Caucus, feels<br />\nmore certain of which candidate is more sympathetic to<br />\nits position on social issues. \"Although he's never come<br />\nout openly in support of gay rights, Carter's done a lot<br />\nsays.<br />\nhe<br />\nus,\"<br />\nhelp<br />\nto<br />\nof<br />\nbackrooming<br />\nFor example, he fought the Immigration service over<br />\npreventing gays from entering the country. Before they<br />\ncould do it on suspicion, but now they can only do it if<br />\nyou're stupid enough to tell them, 'Hey, I'm gay\"<br />\nHaller is apprehensive about the prospect of a Reagan<br />\npresidency, although the former California governor<br />\nopposed a referendum initiative which would have<br />\nrequired the state's school boards to fire gay teachers.<br />\n\"We're really afraid of what Reagan might do, because<br />\nhe's too close to the new fundamentalist religious<br />\ngroups,\" Haller explains.<br />\nLaura Rosenthal, president of the Hopkins<br />\n- Women's Center , also fears Reagan's social attitudes.<br />\n\"If Reagan is elected, his term will be a nightmare for<br />\nwomen,\" she says, citing his opposition to the Equal<br />\n<br />\n\"Most students are middle-of-the-road, so John<br />\nAnderson is very appealing to them,\" SC president<br />\nSteele says. \"He's more than just an alternative.\" He<br />\nbelieves students are attracted by the Illinois congressman's perceived combination of social liberalism\u2014his<br />\nstands on ERA,abortion, and gun control, for example-and fiscal conservatism. Steele adds that he is trying to<br />\nchoose between Carter and Anderson, saying,\"If I had to<br />\nvote now, I'd vote for Carter, but only out of Democratic loyalty.\" He guesses that a majority of SC members<br />\nare also undecided.<br />\nHauer sees a different reason for Anderson's<br />\npopularity. \"For most students, this is the first campaign they can vote in, so many of them tend to look for<br />\nthe perfect candidate,\" she says. \"They don't look at<br />\nwhat he actually stands for. Anderson's running on<br />\nimage, not issues.\"<br />\nSome of the students who watched the ReaganAnderson debate disagreed. \"Anderson was better<br />\nbecause he was more direct, especially on the religion<br />\nissue.\" said Bill Donahue. Peter Merrill concurred. \"I<br />\nwas impressed by Anderson's last answer and his wrapup,\" he said. \"Reagan's closing speech was a complete<br />\ncliche, an excuse for not thinking.\"<br />\nHaller notes than gays tended to support Anderson duririg the primaries because he was the only candidate who openly supported gay rights. \"Anderson,<br />\nunfortunately., has not made it,\" he laments. \"The<br />\npolitical reality is that Anderson can't win, which only<br />\nleaves Carter to sleep through another four years with.\"<br />\n<br />\nQuestion Number 3(asked of those who responded \"certain\",\"probable\", or \"may vote\" to question<br />\n1, 108 total): If the election were held today, whom<br />\nwould you vote for?<br />\nAnswers: Jimmy Carter - 32% Ronald Reagan 16% John Anderson - 32% Don't Know - 16%<br />\nOthers -4%<br />\n(News-Letter poll takers attempted to contact a<br />\nrandom sampling of 212 students, approximately<br />\n10% of Hopkins' undergraduate enrollment. Of those,<br />\n53 failed to respond.)<br />\nAs a glance at the table above shows, President<br />\nCarter has picked up a considerable amount of support<br />\nat Hopkins in the past month, although our sample may<br />\nbe too small to draw a definite conclusion. One possible<br />\nexplanation is that many students are following Chas<br />\nHailer's line of reasoning: \"Why waste your vote on a<br />\nsure loser?\" Traditionally, third party and independent<br />\ncandidates lose support as Election Day approaches,<br />\nbecause the desire to \"be with a winner,\" to \" make<br />\none's vote count,\" increases. When Eugene McCarthy<br />\nran as an independent four years ago, national polls gave<br />\nhis six percent of the vote; the proportion declined to<br />\nless than one percent after the ballots were counted. In<br />\n1968, George Wallace's support dropped from 22<br />\npercent in September to 13 percent in November.<br />\n<br />\nBut Carter's gain has not come at Anderson's<br />\nexpense; instead, he seems to have taken votes away<br />\nfrom Reagan. This shift is hard to account for. Have<br />\nfears about Reagan's alleged bellicosity taken hold? Has<br />\nrelatively good news about the economy made Carter<br />\nlook better? Had adverse media coverage made Reagan<br />\nlook worse? Or is it simply that party loyalty is reasserting itself, helping Carter because of the Democratic<br />\nregistration edge? More extensive polling (sadly impossible under the given time restraints) might have given us<br />\nthe answer.<br />\nIn any event, the survey results tend to disprove<br />\nthe common observation that college students are<br />\napathetic about, and alienated from, the political system. Fully 62 percent of those who responded said they<br />\nwould \"certainly\" or \"probably\" vote. Of those who<br />\nexpected not to, the largest proportion, 43 percent,<br />\nwere legally barred from registering\u2014most of them<br />\nwere simply too young. Only 12 students, or 7.5<br />\npercent of our sample, planned to avoid the ballot box<br />\nas an act of protest. Perhaps these findings should not<br />\nbe too surprising; after all, political sociologists have<br />\nlong known that tht-chances of a person casting a ballot<br />\nincrease with his or her education and affluence\u2014items<br />\nin which we are supposedly rife.<br />\nBut \u2022 perhaps the findings confirm something<br />\nMichael Steele said: \"The country is at a critical point<br />\nThe Polls: What A Difference A Month Makes<br />\nand students are aware of it.\" Maybe the muchfacade.<br />\nWhen the Hopkins chapter of the College Repub- bemoaned Hopkins apathy is no more than a<br />\nlicans canvassed at Homewood September 22-24, they<br />\nNews-Letter staff writers Deborah Jones, Felice<br />\nfound John Anderson in the lead.

KO<br />\nSomeone spent six million dollars<br />\nrecontructing the battered body of an Air<br />\nForce test pilot into Lee Majors. A<br />\ncomparable sum was spent turning the<br />\nactor John Hurt into the greatest freak in<br />\nthe world, the Elephant Man. According<br />\nto his owner, this freak was produced<br />\nnine months after a mad bull elephant<br />\n<br />\nthe multi-colored turban gourd would<br />\nhave looked out of place, nay,ludicrous).<br />\nWhen I saw Eraserhead for the twenty-fourth time last weekend, it struck me<br />\nthat the movie is a modern version of<br />\nDickens' description of life for the<br />\npoor in the shadow of the factory. The<br />\nsame elements are in the Elephant Man,<br />\nbut actually set in Victorian England:<br />\n<br />\nDr. Treves reveals the Elephantman to the London Pathological<br />\nbashed an English lady in India. However, !huge, incomprehensible machines squirtto call him the Elephant Man is merely ing clouds of steam, workmen degraded<br />\nsensational advertising.<br />\nInstead he oy mechanical motions, and belching<br />\nlooks like one of the Italian painter smokestacks(the film owes a big debt to<br />\nArcimboldo's heads, constructed out of Fritz Lang's Metropolis).

The cinematography is also<br />\nreminiscent of Lynch's previous work,<br />\nbroccoli and endive lettuce.<br />\nIn David Lynch's (of Eraserhead especially during the dream sequences.<br />\nfame) new movie adaption of the At the end he again has a large back-lightElephant Man's story, we don't see this ed ball floating on a black background.<br />\nwalking grocery in the flesh until we have The differences in Lynch's handling of<br />\nbeen appropriately tantalized.

When the doctor<br />\n(Anthony Hopkins) who discovered and<br />\ncared for the freak, has to teach him to<br />\ntalk so he won't be kicked out of the<br />\nhospital as a worthless, incurable moron,<br />\nwe are forced to re-evaluate the freak. His<br />\nfirst words seem to come from a mouth<br />\nfull of cotton-wrapped pebbles.

TAYLOR<br />\nJosef von Sternberg's The Blue<br />\nAngel (1930) is most famous as the<br />\nvehicle that shot Marlene Dietrich to<br />\ninternational stardom, as the first talking<br />\nfilm made in Germany, and as an expressionist depiction of cabaret life in Germany during the Weimar Republic. The<br />\nfilm portrays the downfall of a pompous<br />\nmiddle-aged high school professor Immanuel Rath, played by Emil Jannings<br />\n- when he falls in love with the cabaret<br />\nsinger, Lola Lola, played by Dietrich.<br />\nThe UFA film company, run by a<br />\nright-wing German nationalist, Alfred<br />\nHugenberg, produced the film. Hugenberg released films that were critical and<br />\ndestructive of the Republic, either<br />\nsatirizing Weimar types, highlighting<br />\nqualities that they lacked, or merely<br />\ncreating confusion about political issues:.<br />\nMetropolis, directed by Fritz Lang, is a<br />\ngood example of a UFA film that confuses its message, in this case the relationship between industrialists and their<br />\nworkers. These films were part of what<br />\nPeter Gay calls \"The cartelization of<br />\n<br />\nculture\u2014 in preparation for the Nazi<br />\nseizure of powqr in 1933. There seems to<br />\nbe a controversy over whether The Blue<br />\nAngel actually reflects Hugenberg's political ideas whether it is a subtle rightwing critique of the Republic or whether<br />\nit is a psychological profile of social<br />\nbondage.<br />\nWhen we first see Rath, he is<br />\n<br />\nEmil Jannings as the tortured Prof. Rath<br />\n<br />\nAnthony Hopkins plays Dr. Treves<br />\nstripped of his mask. He keeps the crowd<br />\nat bay by yelling that he is not an animal<br />\nbut a human. After seeing this movie,<br />\nI felt like going down to the Marble Bar<br />\nand saying to the grotesqueries there,<br />\n\"There, there. I'll find you a nice comfortable hospital room where you can<br />\nseive tea to Baltimore society, make a<br />\npaper model of the factory outside your<br />\nwindow, and prove you're still human.<br />\nAnd I'll be sure never to let a mirror in<br />\nthe room, pimply git.\"<br />\nThe Elephant Man is neither an<br />\nanimal nor a vegetable (nor a mineral,<br />\ndespite his likeness to the Rock of<br />\nGibraltar): he is a gentle human being<br />\nwhose sensitivity borders on affected<br />\nfoppery. I wish Lynch had played more<br />\nwith high society's reaction to the freak<br />\nand the difference between that reaction<br />\nand the lower classes'. He never answers<br />\nthe question of whether society's patronization of the freak is ultimately as<br />\nharmful as the mob's taunts. Nevertheless, the movie is good and serious and<br />\nleaves you with an understanding of the<br />\nresidents of this charming city.<br />\nA final thought: poor Mr. Bowie<br />\n(starring in the unrelated Broadway<br />\nproduction of The Elephant Man)--I just<br />\ncannot see how he became a rock star and<br />\nan idol of millions with such obscene<br />\ndeformities.<br />\nIt's a movie.<br />\n<br />\nbeginning a safely routine day with<br />\nbreakfast brought in on a tray by a<br />\nhawk-faced housekeeper. The first sign<br />\nthat something is wrong comes when he<br />\nfinds that his pet song bird has died in its<br />\ncage. The housekeeper duly tosses the<br />\nlittle corpse into the furnace. Rath uses<br />\nthe sugar cube that he was going to offer<br />\nhis pet in his own cup of coffee, thus<br />\nidentifying himself with it.<br />\nThe symbolism of the bird in its<br />\ncage follows Rath throughout the film.<br />\nHis classroom is his first cage. Ridiculed<br />\nby his students, he seeks release in music,<br />\nopening the window to listen to a choir<br />\nsinging outside. That night, Rath goes to<br />\na night club, The Blue Angel, in his<br />\nteacher's robes to rout some of his<br />\nstudents who he thinks are entertaining<br />\nthemselves there. As he moves into the<br />\nback streets of the city, he becomes<br />\nentrapped in his surroundings. In the<br />\nfoggy gas-lit night, twisted buildings rise<br />\nat impossible angles to either side of<br />\nRath's figure as he stumbles down narrow<br />\nIn The Blue Angel, a clauslanes.<br />\ntrophobic space is established.

Later to consummate this image, the love-sick Rath<br />\nis fed sugar cubes by Lola Lola. He<br />\nbecomes more birdlike, eventually imitating a cock in obscene and humilating<br />\nsequences, as his self-destruction through<br />\nLola proceeds.<br />\nIn a sense Lola Lola is also Rath's<br />\nsong bird. Like the other chorus singers<br />\nin their feathered costumes, she is<br />\ntrapped in her own role. Rath may see<br />\nher as a lady, but she is really a call girl of<br />\nsorts, stuck in a tawdry show tour circuit.<br />\nShe is amused and flattered by Rath,<br />\nhaving a playful affection for him as a<br />\nfather figure, but because Rath cannot<br />\nsupport her, she cannot sacrifice her<br />\ncareer for him. Rath cannot impose his<br />\nmoral standards on Lola, just as she<br />\ncannot adapt him to the seamy cabaret<br />\nworld, without one destroying the other.<br />\nNumerous scenes in shich Lola and Rath<br />\nare pictured on either side of barred or<br />\ncurtained barriers indicate that they are<br />\nlocked in different cages, each just as<br />\neffective as the other.<br />\n<br />\nOur eyes are carefully directed to<br />\nmore intricate fore-shadowings of Rath's<br />\nfate. We see repeatedly the fragile parade<br />\nof Daumier-like figures of aged men that<br />\ncircle the base of the school clock.

The play<br />\n<br />\npresents the relationship between two gay<br />\nmen, Greg and Ward, who share a sublet<br />\napartment in Greenwich Village. Most of<br />\nthe play centers on a patterned game<br />\nbetween the two men that resembles an<br />\nargument.<br />\nThe real dispute begins when<br />\nWard brings home Barry, an egocentric<br />\nleather queen, for the night. Barry<br />\npromptly falls in love with the apartment<br />\nand decides to split up Ward and Greg to<br />\nget it. It is not, however, his attempt to<br />\ntake the apartment, but how Greg and<br />\nWard adjust to the changes in their<br />\nrelationship, which is the most important<br />\n<br />\nUndergrad Film Workshop<br />\nvON STERNBERG<br />\n<br />\nBY DEBORAH JONES<br />\nFilmmakers and would-be filmmakers now have the chance to practice<br />\ntheir art in the Undergraduate Film<br />\nWorkshop. The workshop meets the first<br />\nand third Tuesday of each month from<br />\n8:00-10:00 pm in Gilman 110, Its<br />\npurpose is to give students access to film<br />\nand video equipment and knowledge of<br />\nits use. The program, which does not<br />\ncarry academic credit, is designed for<br />\nstudents who have no filmmaking experience, but the workshop can give more<br />\nexperienced students the chance to<br />\nproduce short films and video tapes.<br />\nSeventeen students are presently<br />\ninvolved in the workshop, which was<br />\nstarted by sophomore Mark Hollander, a<br />\nfilm major who has produced five short<br />\nworks, and is also an intern at the Johns<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Hospital motion picture studio.<br />\n\"The film workshop was started because<br />\nstudents very often find their courses<br />\nplanned for them during their entire four<br />\nyears at Hopkins without the opportunity<br />\nto take a film course for credit,\" he said.<br />\n\"The workshop offers these students a<br />\nchance to produce a film despite their<br />\nschedule restrictions.\"<br />\nThe workshop uses equipment from<br />\nthe now-defunct Media Center. Production is primarily in Super 8, but arrangements may be made for video and 16 mm<br />\nequipment. The equipment may be<br />\nchecked out on a liability contract basis<br />\nMondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from<br />\n11-12. The only cost to students is the<br />\nprice of supplies (film or video tape) and<br />\nprocessing. The next meeting of the<br />\nUndergraduate Film Workshop will be<br />\nheld Tuesday, November 4.<br />\n<br />\nto the play.<br />\nJoe Uher and Silas White play<br />\nthe roommates Ward and Greg respectively. Both have considerable acting experience, including some work by Uher for<br />\nTheater Hopkins. They perform excellently together in the running argument<br />\non which the play's comedy depends. The<br />\nrapid pace of their argument convinces<br />\nthe audience that it is something<br />\nthey<br />\nlive with every day and is part of the way<br />\nthey get along, rather than a sign of true<br />\nenmity. Lou Kelly as the flighty subletting landlord, and Peter Devons, as Barry,<br />\nboth perform well. Ms. Kelly also has one<br />\nof the best speeches in the play, in which<br />\nshe explains how gay men have forced<br />\nher from various occupations, including<br />\nbeautician and stewardess.<br />\nThe play is directed by Chuck<br />\nMiller of the Fells Point Theater and<br />\nproduced by Jack Taylor. They are<br />\nco-founders of The Theater Closet and<br />\nhave managed to start the group from<br />\nscratch and convert the ground floor of<br />\nwhat used to be a wafehouse into an<br />\nadequate, though small, theater. The<br />\nscript was written and revised for this<br />\nproduction by Doric Wilson. Wilson's<br />\ndialogue is realistic in its depiction of<br />\nmodern gay life. However, the play's<br />\nproblems stem from a late revelation of<br />\nBarry's motive(wanting the apartment)<br />\nthat draws too much attention away from<br />\nGreg and Ward, and also from a few<br />\nextraneous scenarios that seem to do<br />\nlittle to further the plot.<br />\nA Perfect Relationship is solid<br />\ndebut comedy for a new theater group.<br />\nCloset Theater was established this<br />\nsummer to fill the need for a primarily<br />\ngay theater in Baltimore. Its planned<br />\nfuture productions are 'A Late Show (a<br />\nlesbian play), Newsboy (a drama), and<br />\nBoy Meets Boy (a musical). If everything<br />\nworks out, the group hopes to expand to<br />\na five-show season next year.<br />\nPerformances of A Perfect Relationship are Friday and Saturday nights<br />\nat 8:30 and Sunday at 7:00 at the Gay<br />\nCommunity Center, 241 W. Chase Street<br />\n(about a block from the opera house).<br />\nTickets are $3.50 and reservations are<br />\nsuggested for at least the Friday night<br />\nshow (837-5445).<br />\n<br />\npeople alike: significantly, the ringmasters<br />\nof the misbehaving students are an<br />\ninsolent wealthy boy and a Jew, presented as an insidious trickster. Yet the<br />\nflustered professor seems to ignore his<br />\nstudent Angst, the only person who<br />\nrespects his position and authority. The<br />\nblond, bespectacled Angst, a model of the<br />\ndutiful, hardworking student and a<br />\nhumble picture of the ideal Naziyouth, is<br />\nvictimized by his fellow students. Rath,<br />\nwho might befriend Angst, betrays his<br />\nposition of guidance as the father figure<br />\nby choosing to join the others in publicly<br />\nhumiliating the pathetic Angst. Von<br />\nSternberg seems to be advocating a<br />\nrevitalization of old Germany by an<br />\nalliance with this new nationalistic ideal<br />\nrepresented by Angst. The subplot<br />\ndealing with Angst is so overshadowed by<br />\nRath's relationship with Lola that its<br />\nmessage is obscured. The film only<br />\nconveys a vague feeling of nostalgia and<br />\ndissatisfaction with the present.<br />\nThe power of The Blue Angel,<br />\nwhich overrides and distracts the viewer<br />\nfrom all these implications, rests in the<br />\nemotional impact of Jannings' portrayal<br />\nof Rath's hopeless love for Lola and his<br />\ndespair at the loss of his former life that<br />\ndraws him into a pitiful, and finally<br />\nterrifying, insanity. Jannings creates this<br />\nmood with facial and bodily expression,<br />\nusing very few words. Dietrich has a<br />\nchildish allure for Rath as she casually<br />\ndresses and adjusts her vulgar, awkward<br />\ncostumes in scene after scene. Rath<br />\nresponds to her teasing and her endearing<br />\ncoquettishness with the innocent eagerness of a schoolboy. At the end, the<br />\nviewer is left with a sense that Rath has<br />\nfulfilled his destiny, but also a feeling<br />\nthat nothing has been accomplished by<br />\nthis process of change: nothing has<br />\nchanged, and we are not sure that Rath<br />\nhas learned anything. Rath, whatever he<br />\nonce was, has been wasted. The Blue<br />\nAngel is worth seeing not only as a<br />\ndocument of its times, but also as a<br />\ndramatic and touching tragedy of<br />\nhopeless love.<br />\nThe Blue Angel will be shown Sunday,<br />\nOct. 26 at 7:30 pm in Shriver Hall(sponsored by The Reel World).<br />\n<br />\nContest<br />\ncvnt.from p. 13<br />\nannounced sometime in February.<br />\nWinning pieces will then be performed in<br />\nthe L-V room or the Glass Pavilion.<br />\nDean Sigmund Suskind has promised to<br />\nmake honorary mention of the contest<br />\nwinners at graduation.

Saturday, October<br />\n11th, the Blue Jays were routed<br />\nby the perpetually strong Ursinus College team. Egged on by a<br />\nfanatic coach and screaming fans<br />\nat every crucial point along the<br />\ncourse, the Beau took the<br />\nfirst four places, with Jon<br />\nPerroto winning the five-mile<br />\nrace in 26:39.7 First across the<br />\nline for Hopkings was Andrew<br />\nBresica in 27:13, followed<br />\nclosely by David Stewart, 27:20.<br />\nThree more Jrsinus runners<br />\ncame in before the next Hopkins<br />\nharrier, Jeff Bickart, made it,<br />\ntaking tenth place in 28:31.<br />\nThe other Hopkins runners were<br />\nJohn Roemer (15th, 29:47)<br />\nBill Shutze (16th, 31:11 ),Dave<br />\nGrinnell (17th, 31:11), and Will<br />\nFeldman (19th, 31:58). Ursinus<br />\nwon, 17-44.<br />\nAt Western Maryland College on the 14th, it was a different story. Even without Dave<br />\nStewart, JHU won easily, 20-35.<br />\nAndrew Brescia ran away from<br />\nthe field and cruised to an<br />\neasy victory, setting a course<br />\nrecord of 26:52 for the hilly<br />\n8000-meter circuit. More that<br />\na minute behind was tiopkins'<br />\nJeff Bickart, who took 2nd place<br />\nin 27:53, barely staying ahead<br />\nof Western Maryland's first<br />\nrunner, John Kebler, who<br />\ncrossed the finish line only eight<br />\nseconds later. Taking it easy,<br />\nbut nevertheless clinching the<br />\nmeet for Hopkins, were John<br />\nRoemer (4th, 29:14), Dave<br />\nGrineel (6th, 30:14), Will<br />\nFeldman (7th, 30:55), and<br />\nMark Kaplan (9th, 31:02). It<br />\nwas an altogether pleasant meet.<br />\nThe easy-going, friendly manner<br />\nof the Western Maryland team<br />\nand coach was in marked con-<br />\n<br />\ntrast to that of Ursinus.<br />\ner,(8th, 27:18). Following him<br />\nThis past Wednesday, Leb- for Hopkins were Dave Grinpel<br />\nanon Valley College edged out (12th.28:44 ), Bill Shutze (14th,<br />\nHopkins, 27 to 29.<br />\n29:13),<br />\nMark<br />\nKaplan<br />\nJHU's<br />\nAndrew Brescia clocked an ani- (15,29:31), and Will Feldman<br />\nazillg time of 25:01 for the five (16th,30:14)<br />\nThe value of an encouraging<br />\nmiles, setting a course record in<br />\nword to a fatigued runner<br />\ncannot be overestimated. It<br />\nmay be just what he needs to<br />\nmake him go after the guy in<br />\nfront of him. Anyone with half<br />\nan hour to spare this Saturday<br />\nafternoon can find out that<br />\ncross-country really isn't so<br />\nboring and help the Hopkins<br />\nteam as well. Just stand anywhere along San Martin Drive,<br />\nfrom above the BIA field in<br />\nWyman Park to University<br />\nParkway, between 2:00 and<br />\n2:30, and you can watch a<br />\ncontinous stream of runners,<br />\nshout encouraging, uplifting<br />\nthe process.

He quoted statistics<br />\nshowing that the amount spent<br />\non health care has increased<br />\ndramatically over the past thirty<br />\nyears, in terms of both dollars<br />\nand percentage of Gross National Product. The fraction of<br />\nGNP now spent in this area is<br />\nclose to 10%, Richmond said.<br />\nThis attracts the interest of<br />\nother groups in the economy,<br />\ncreating \"ramifications which go<br /><br />\nfar beyond\" the medical sector.<br />\nhe added.<br />\nRichmond said health systems agencies are presently<br />\nplanning to minimize the rate of<br />\nexpenditure in the health care<br />\nindustry, especially in capital<br />\ncosts and construction.

The effects of infectious diseases, especially diseases<br />\nof childhood, have been greatly<br />\nreduced, and some diseases, such<br />\nas smallpox, have almost been<br />\neradicated, Richmond said.

I<br />\nthought this year's freshmen<br />\nwould eat quality fare. No such<br />\nluck. I was unfortunate enough<br />\nto visit the dorms cafeteria<br />\nWednesday evening to partake of<br />\nthe delicacies slapped onto stillwet plates. Three entrees were<br />\noffered for my dining pleasure:<br />\nroast beef, bacon quiche, and<br />\nshepherd's pie. Whipped potatoes, a choice of vegetables, and<br />\nassorted cakes completed the<br />\nmenu. The beef was the best of<br />\nthe three, even though it was<br />\ntough and fatty. The management made an attempt at<br />\nshepherd's pie. It looked pretty,<br />\nbut tasted bland, and the meat<br />\nwas loaded with filler. The<br />\nquiche was not too bad, but it<br />\nwas cold and its crust was very<br />\nsoggy.<br />\nWhile the quality of the<br />\nentrees is basically unchanged,<br />\nthe vegetables have improved<br /><br />\nand the desserts have gotten<br />\neven worse. The vegetables were<br />\nobviously frozen and the potatoes powdered, but the vegetables were not soggy as in the<br />\npast. Both the carrots and the<br />\nmixed vegetables were prepared<br />\nwell. The butter beans were<br />\natrocious - overcooked and<br />\nwaterlogged but living in the<br />\nSouth for seven years has made<br />\nme accustomed to perfect butter<br />\nbeans. The cake was dry and the<br />\nicing consisted of a scrap of<br />\ncolor across the top. The liquid<br />\nin the topping of the pineapple<br />\nupside-down cake had seeped all<br />\nthe way through, making the<br />\ncake quite damp. The other<br />\ndesserts were palatable--it is<br />\ndifficult to harm Jello, whip and<br />\nchill, and fresh oranges. Cold,<br />\ncongealed,lumpy lentil soup was<br />\nalso available.<br />\nSince I only sampled one<br />\nnight's bill of fare, I asked<br />\nseveral freshmen and one houseabout the service<br />\nmaster<br />\nand the quality of other meals.<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nWhen it's finally Friday afternoon and<br />\nyou're browsing through our Bookcenter<br />\nbecause you can't stand the thought of<br />\nreading Streitweiser and Heathcock before<br />\ngoing out and getting drunk, don't expect<br />\nto find too much in the way of good<br />\nalternatives.<br />\nWhat was once a half-adequate offering<br />\nof magazines has dwindled to a meagre<br />\nand uninteresting collection.

There is also<br /><br />\na line of \"Praise the Lord\" postcards, and<br />\neven an offering of children's coloring<br />\nbooks, entitled The Bible Fun Books.<br />\nNow it is obviously futile to rant and<br />\nrave about coercion of minds or censorship. We encourage the distribution of all<br />\nbooks - Christian, radical, or whatever<br />\nelse. There have been examples over the<br />\nlast year where \"leftist\" and \"alternative\"<br />\npublications were denied sale at the store,<br />\nbut we've been told this is no more. The<br />\npoint is not to suppress unusual book<br />\nofferings, but to promote them.

Perhaps your readers<br />\napathy is due to a belief that the<br />\nsituation is hopeless. In the<br />\nchance, however, that you will<br />\ncarefully consider a reader's<br />\nsuggestions, I offer the following<br />\nobservations.<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nThe<br />\ncontinually portrays women in<br />\na sexist light.

Another case in point is<br />\nyour centerfold of October 17,<br />\n\"My Dream,\" a piece unworthy<br />\nto be called journalism, and the<br />\nsexist drawings accompanying it.<br />\nWomen happen to be people<br />\nwho do interesting things on this<br />\ncampus.

I am deeply<br />\noffended by the attitudes .toward women implied by many<br />\nof your pictures and articles.<br />\nIn a more positive vein, I do<br />\nrecognize in your centerfold<br />\ndrawings the clever allusion to<br />\nthe Shriver Hall murals. The<br />\nmurals really are gross, aren't<br />\nthey? Is there anything that can<br />\nbe done to get rid of them?<br /><br />\nA number of reported facts in<br />\nyour article were wrong.

Here comes<br />\nthe complaint. Two weeks ago,<br />\na letter from a Goucher student<br />\njustifiably angered at the portrayal of Goucher women as sex<br />\nkittens in Newsletter graphics<br />\nasked why -- if the portrayal is<br />\nan accurate one -- you Hopkins<br />\nmen even bother with them.<br />\nYour answer was \"Need you<br />\ncont, on p. 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br /><br />\nRuthchild,Fischer,Einolf Speak Out<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nask?:: -- or, homonymically.<br />\n\"need your ass.\"<br />\nThough the Newletter is<br />\nnow in the tradition of good<br />\ncollege papers, your editorial<br />\nresponse was in the tradition of<br />\nhumor.<br />\nlocker-room<br />\nsnide<br />\n\"Need you ask?\" was a cheap<br />\nshot. You have an obligation to<br />\nyour female readers, Hopkins<br />\nand Goucher students alike, to<br />\ntreat them with more respect<br />\nthan your response of October<br />\n10th implied. But you also owe<br />\nit to yourself, as editor, to keep<br />\nthe quality of editorial response<br />\nat the high level to which you<br />\nhave brought the Newsletter's<br />\nwriting and reporting this year.<br />\nCheap shots are simply not<br />\nworthy of you.<br /><br />\nGCS Gripes<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nI would like to respond to<br />\nthe article by Mr. Harris in last<br />\nweek's edition.<br />\nAbout the<br />\nonly accurate fact in the entire<br />\npiece was that our tables were<br />\nstolen. I realize that Mr. Harris<br />\ngot a little carried away with his<br />\nown sarcastic wit, but let's be<br />\nfair. The Gilman Coffee Shop is<br />\na non-profit, student-run service.<br />\nThe GCS isn't exactly popular<br />\nwith the administration of this<br />\ncampus. Sure, they don't say<br />\nmuch when everything is going<br />\nwell, but we can catch it over<br />\nthe slightest screw-up. We get<br />\nminimal funds and can't afford<br />\nto replace the equipment on a<br />\nyearly basis.<br />\nGeraldine Ruthchild<br />\nAs manager of this year's<br />\nshop, I can assure all interested<br />\nparties that we are making every<br /><br />\neffort to get more tables. We are<br />\nall students ourselves and miss<br />\nthe tables as much as anyone.<br />\nYou will have tables soon and<br />\nnot because some sarcastic wit<br />\nfailed to get the facts. All<br />\nthe employees know that tables<br />\nare in the works, just ask.<br />\nAs for being hit by inflation, Mr. Harris failed to note<br />\nthat GCS prices have held for<br />\nthe third straight year. There<br />\nwas a five cent increase in the<br />\nprice of tea, but the price<br />\nof turnovers and eclairs dropped<br />\nby the same amount. We have<br />\nalso expanded our hours from<br />\n8:30 am to 4:30 . We hope this<br />\naffords better service for loyal<br />\npatrons.<br />\nWe appreciate all<br />\nsuggestions, but resent sarcastic<br />\ncriticism that has not been<br />\nsubstantiated by anyone that<br />\nwould know the facts.

At breakfast,<br />\nthe eggs are overcooked, the<br />\nbacon greasy, the pancakes and<br />\nfrench toast leathery, and the<br />\nsyrup far too thick. The continental breakfast consists of<br />\neverything not eaten beforeliand--no fresh pastries are offered and the cereal containers<br />\nare often empty.<br />\nComplaints about the service, especially at lunch, were<br />\nuniversal. The cafeteria runs<br />\nout of silverware and trays<br />\nduring peak times. It then runs<br />\nout of food, forcing students<br />\nto stand in line for as long as<br />\nfifteen minutes until fresh supplies are sent to the serving<br />\nline. Frequently a line forms<br />\noutside; one freshman said she<br />\nwas often forced to wait thirty<br />\nminutes to get her card punched.<br />\nShe said this delay causes<br />\nproblems on days when she has<br />\nonly one hour between classes<br />\nfor lunch. Other complaints are:<br />\nthe ice machines are usually<br />\nempty, the flies are always a<br />\nproblem, the employees are slow<br />\nin refilling empty milk dispensers, and the supply of tea<br />\nIn<br />\nbags is often depleted.<br />\naddition, the dining hall closes<br />\nearly and refuses to put out<br />\nadditional food near closing<br />\ntime. Several people said they<br />\nhad been refused admittance<br />\nbefore the posted closing time<br />\nand others said they were unable<br />\nto enter the cafeteria area to<br />\nobtain second helpings. Also,<br />\nthe food is often cold and tastes<br />\nstale.<br />\nSeveral freshmen were more<br />\nthan willing to offer suggestions.<br />\nThey urged ARA to prepare<br />\nmore basic fare that would be<br />\neasier to cook well and would<br />\nretain flavor and texture for<br />\na longer period of time instead<br />\nof conjuring up intricate gourmet (?) items.<br />\nAlso, they<br />\nsaid, tne management should<br />\nplan more special meals to<br />\nmaintain interest.

That honor was explained. \"Most of the residents will always stay<br />\nreserved for panelist Daniel Greenberg when he told the Democratic, but will vote Republican if there's a good<br />\ncandidates to answer his questions and stop making candidate.\"<br />\nThe students concentrated on distributing<br />\ncampaign speeches.<br />\nliterature and also did some polling.\"Our goal<br />\ncampaign<br />\nEven supporters of the candidates seemed<br />\nunimpressed, although most of the Reagan and Ander-son campaign workers at Hopkins were away at celebrations downtown. Peter Merrill, a freshman History of<br />\nScience major who said he leaned towards voting for<br />\nAnderson, joked that the Illinois congressman \"halfanswered\" a question about the economy. The proportion increased to three-quarters when Anderson responded, to a query about U.S. military strength. After<br />\nAnderson criticized Cardinal Humberto Medieros for<br />\nurging Boston-area Catholics to vote against pro-abortion<br />\ncandidates and restated his own pro-choice position,<br />\nMerrill said,\"Hey, he finally answered one.\"<br />\nNnamdi Ezera, a sophomore Political Science<br />\nmajor from Nigeria and president of the Black Student<br />\nUnion, was disappointed that the candidates failed to<br />\n- address the problems of minorities more directly than<br />\nthey did. \"When they were asked about the cities, they<br />\ntalked about water mains and sewers, not people,\" he<br />\nsaid. He added that he favored President Carter as \"the<br />\nlesser of three evils.\"<br />\nNot all the students expressed discontent with<br />\nthe candidates of the debate.\"They covered most of the<br />\nmajor issues,\" said Bill Donahue,a freshman Engineering<br />\nmajor from upstate New York. One Reagan backer was<br />\npleased with his candidate's performance. \"I expected<br />\nhim to screw up, because he sometimes speaks without<br />\nthinking,\" said Jeff Robinson, a freshman pre-med<br />\nfrom New York City.<br />\nis to pass out as much literature as possible,\" Brown told<br />\nhis troops.

But a<br />\nmarning, October 4, to pass out flyers and canvass. The large number of voters they encountered were still<br />\nvolunteers concentrated their efforts on the Hamilton, undecided. In one area, encompassing parts of Beier<br />\nRoad, Walther Avenue and Moravia Road, Reagan was in<br />\nfront of Carter 12 votes to 10, with two for Anderson<br />\nand 17 undecided. McCall admitted, however, that<br />\nReagan was behind 2-to-1 on the other side of Belair<br />\nRoad. A final tally was unavailable.<br /><br />\nmany Reagan buttons around.\" Young Democrats'<br />\npresident Carolyn Hauer disputes Steele's contention.<br />\n\"We've held meetings, stuffed mailboxes, and set up a<br />\ntable in Gilman. We don't have enough buttons to give<br />\neveryone because this is the Democratic Party - we don't<br />\nhave the money to throw around like the Republicans<br />\ndo.<br />\nAlthough some Young Democrats say they plan<br />\nto vote for John Anderson or that they are still trying to<br />\ndecide between Anderson and Carter, Hauer dismisses<br />\nlack of enthusiasm for the party's candidate as a problem in getting students to work for the ticket. \"In any<br />\nelection there are people who aren't thrilled with the<br />\ncandidate, but support him anyway,\" Hauer says. She<br />\nclaims that only \"two or three\" of the Young Democrats' approximately 30 members at Hopkins back<br />\nAnderson.<br />\n\"The Anderson people have worked very hard,\"<br />\nSteele says. \"For example, they brought (Anderson<br />\nrunning mate) Patrick Lucey here to speak.\" However,<br />\nthe Anderson campaign finds fewer uses for student<br />\nvolunteers than it did during the primaries, according to<br />\ncampus coordinator Brian Mirskv, because Anderson's<br /><br />\nArea residents were mostly friendly, even those<br />\nwho opposed the Republican ticket. \"As long as you're<br />\nnot Communists,\" one Carter supporter told freshman<br />\nJames Bumbalo. However, one young woman was<br />\nannoyed at being woken up. \"You and Reagan can go<br />\nfuck yourselves,\" she said to Bobb.<br />\nMcCall was pleased with the College Republicans'<br />\nefforts. \"We're getting a more enthusiastic response<br />\nfrom students this time around,\" he said. \"It seems like<br />\nyoungsters are becoming more independent-minded, and<br />\nmore rational. They listen less to rabble-rousers than<br />\nthey used to.\" The Republicans have also canvassed on<br />\ncampus: last Sunday they held a fundraiser in the Glass<br />\nPavillion attended by Senator Charles Mathias and most<br />\nof the GOP's Maryland congressional candidates.<br />\nPrivately, some active Hopkins GOP members<br />\nexpress doubts about Reagan, especially his stands<br />\non abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment, the Panama<br />\nCanal treaty, and arms control. Many supported<br />\nHoward Baker, George Bush, or John Anderson in the<br />\nprimaries. In fact, an in-house debate (with members<br />\ntaking Reagan and Anderson stands) resulted in more<br />\nAnderson than Reagan votes at an informal election<br />\nbased on the debate.<br />\n\"The Young Democrats have done virtually<br />\nnothing on this campus for Carter, while the College<br />\nRepublicans have done a lot for their candidate,\" says<br />\nStudent Council president Michael Steele. \"I've seen so<br /><br />\nissues in the campaign directly affect undergraduate<br />\neducation. \"We need a federal agency kke the Department of Education to address problems like the cost and<br />\nquality of schooling, but Reagan wants to abolish it<br />\nbecause he thinks education will take care of itself,\" he<br />\nsays.<br />\n\"Anyone who's here on financial aid should not<br />\nbe voting for Reagan,\" Hauer declares. \"Carter has done<br />\na lot to expand it.\" She pointed to his increase in the<br />\nfamily income ceiling for Basic Educational Opportunity<br />\nGrants. \"Any extreme form of conservatism, such<br />\nas Reagan represents, will be detrimental to financial<br />\naid,\" adds senior Chas Haller, a reluctant Carter supporter.<br />\nSuch fears are based on \"rhetoric, not reality,\"<br />\ncontends Harry Davis, a freshman member of the College<br />\nRepublicans. \"When he was governor of California,<br />\nReagan cut educational spending, but he expanded<br />\nprograms and increased benefits. Reagan is being judged<br />\non rhetoric, not his record.\"<br />\nMembers of the Hopkins Christian Fellowship are<br />\nconcerned with the proportion of the federal spending<br />\nallocated to the military. \"As future bread-winners,<br />\nhomeowners, and taxpayers, the quality of our lives will<br />\nbe affected by the amount of resources devoted to<br />\narms,\" says Fellowship president David Niebuhr. \"As<br />\nChristians we're very reluctant to support the use of<br />\nviolence. Although some of us are for Reagan, we worry<br /><br />\nHopkins Christian Fellowship president David Niebuhr<br /><br />\nstrategists have decided to concentrate their limited<br />\nresources on television, newspaper, and radio advertising.<br />\nThe College Republicans and the Young Democrats will debate October 28, before the the candidates<br />\nthemselves meet, and they have also scheduled a joint<br />\nelection night party. \"The Democrats and Republicans<br />\nare cooperating and will continue to cooperate,\" Bobb<br />\nsays. \"One of our basic goals is to increase voter awareness and reduce the amount of apathy, while still<br />\nfollowing our respective beliefs.\" Hauer told her group,<br />\n\"It's more important to build interest than to score<br />\npoints off the Republicans, though that would be nice<br />\ntoo.\"<br />\nStudents In General<br />\n\"This campus is not really politically active,\"<br />\nSteele says. \"Students are concerned about the election,<br />\nbut they haven't demonstrated it.\" He believes some<br /><br />\nthat he's too iron-fisted, that he could get us involved in<br />\na war too easily.\" Haller adds, \"Although Reagan has<br />\nopposed Carter's registration and said he would never<br />\nuse a draft in peacetime, he's never explained what he<br />\nmeant by peacetime. He could use semantics against us.<br />\nI trust Carter more than Reagan, because Carter will<br />\nhave a good reason for using the draft, while Reagan<br />\nmay not.\"<br />\nChris Campbell, a member of the now-defunct<br />\nNew Political Caucus, is more concerned about another<br />\nforeign policy issue\u2014human rights. \"Reagan will relegate human rights to the back seat. For example, he's<br />\nagainst aid to Nicaragua, because he still sees a Communist conspiracy in everything.\"<br />\nPresident Carter does not escape criticism for his<br />\nhandling of foreign affairs. \"Carter has lacked the<br />\nstrength of his convictions to carry out a course of<br />\naction,\" Niebuhr says.\"He's been wishy-washy.\"<br />\nlsiebuhr also feels the candidates haw neglected several<br />\nimportant subjects during the campaign. \"Neither<br />\ncandidate has come out with a moral stand on the<br />\nfamily,\" he says. He cites the \"marriage tax\"\u2014higher<br /><br />\nRights Amendment and his advocacy of an amendment<br />\nbanning abortion. \"The situation for women did not get<br />\nbetter under Carter, but it will definitely get worse<br />\nunder Reagan.\" College Republicans who agree with her<br />\non ERA and abortion dispute her contention, maintaining that these are not \"presidential issues\" because the<br />\npresident has no official role in the constitutional<br />\namendment process, and that ERA has been stalled<br />\ndespite Carter's support.<br />\nThe abortion issue is less important to Christian<br />\nFellowship members, according to Niebuhr,even though<br />\nmost of them take the \"pro-life\" stance. \"Reagan's<br />\nposition is better, but it's not a major factor in the<br />\ndecisions of the people in the Fellowship unless the<br />\ncandidates have equal appeal in other areas,\" he says.<br />\nAlthough Fellowship members side with Reagan<br />\nin opposing Medicaidfunding for abortion, they question<br />\nhis commitment to helping the poor. \"Society as a<br />\nwhole has a responsibility towards the disadvantaged, in<br />\nhelping them care for themselves,\" says Niebuhr. \"We<br />\nwonder whether Reagan leans more towards business<br />\ninterests.\" But he also raps Carter for being \"ineffectual<br />\nat dealing with interest 2roups.\"<br /><br />\nBlack Student Union nresident Nnamdi Ezera<br />\n19 percent were undecided, and one percent said they<br />\nintended to vote for other candidates.<br />\nA telephone poll taken by the News-Letter<br />\nOctober 21-23 revealed that student attitudes had<br />\nchanged.

He cites unemployment, the<br />\nrevitalization of urban centers, and minority appointments to influential government posts as particular areas<br />\nof interest. He believes the majority of BSU members<br />\nwill vote for Carter \"because the alternative is unthinkable.\"<br />\nThe Anderson Factor<br /><br />\nYoung Democrats president Carolyn Hauer<br />\nHailer's group, the Hopkins Gay Caucus, feels<br />\nmore certain of which candidate is more sympathetic to<br />\nits position on social issues. \"Although he's never come<br />\nout openly in support of gay rights, Carter's done a lot<br />\nsays.<br />\nhe<br />\nus,\"<br />\nhelp<br />\nto<br />\nof<br />\nbackrooming<br />\nFor example, he fought the Immigration service over<br />\npreventing gays from entering the country.

Steele adds that he is trying to<br />\nchoose between Carter and Anderson, saying,\"If I had to<br />\nvote now, I'd vote for Carter, but only out of Democratic loyalty.\" He guesses that a majority of SC members<br />\nare also undecided.<br />\nHauer sees a different reason for Anderson's<br />\npopularity. \"For most students, this is the first campaign they can vote in, so many of them tend to look for<br />\nthe perfect candidate,\" she says. \"They don't look at<br />\nwhat he actually stands for. Anderson's running on<br />\nimage, not issues.\"<br />\nSome of the students who watched the ReaganAnderson debate disagreed. \"Anderson was better<br />\nbecause he was more direct, especially on the religion<br />\nissue.\" said Bill Donahue. Peter Merrill concurred. \"I<br />\nwas impressed by Anderson's last answer and his wrapup,\" he said. \"Reagan's closing speech was a complete<br />\ncliche, an excuse for not thinking.\"<br />\nHaller notes than gays tended to support Anderson duririg the primaries because he was the only candidate who openly supported gay rights. \"Anderson,<br />\nunfortunately., has not made it,\" he laments. \"The<br />\npolitical reality is that Anderson can't win, which only<br />\nleaves Carter to sleep through another four years with.\"<br /><br />\nQuestion Number 3(asked of those who responded \"certain\",\"probable\", or \"may vote\" to question<br />\n1, 108 total): If the election were held today, whom<br />\nwould you vote for?<br />\nAnswers: Jimmy Carter - 32% Ronald Reagan 16% John Anderson - 32% Don't Know - 16%<br />\nOthers -4%<br />\n(News-Letter poll takers attempted to contact a<br />\nrandom sampling of 212 students, approximately<br />\n10% of Hopkins' undergraduate enrollment. Of those,<br />\n53 failed to respond.)<br />\nAs a glance at the table above shows, President<br />\nCarter has picked up a considerable amount of support<br />\nat Hopkins in the past month, although our sample may<br />\nbe too small to draw a definite conclusion. One possible<br />\nexplanation is that many students are following Chas<br />\nHailer's line of reasoning: \"Why waste your vote on a<br />\nsure loser?\" Traditionally, third party and independent<br />\ncandidates lose support as Election Day approaches,<br />\nbecause the desire to \"be with a winner,\" to \" make<br />\none's vote count,\" increases. When Eugene McCarthy<br />\nran as an independent four years ago, national polls gave<br />\nhis six percent of the vote; the proportion declined to<br />\nless than one percent after the ballots were counted. In<br />\n1968, George Wallace's support dropped from 22<br />\npercent in September to 13 percent in November.<br /><br />\nBut Carter's gain has not come at Anderson's<br />\nexpense; instead, he seems to have taken votes away<br />\nfrom Reagan. This shift is hard to account for. Have<br />\nfears about Reagan's alleged bellicosity taken hold? Has<br />\nrelatively good news about the economy made Carter<br />\nlook better? Had adverse media coverage made Reagan<br />\nlook worse? Or is it simply that party loyalty is reasserting itself, helping Carter because of the Democratic<br />\nregistration edge? More extensive polling (sadly impossible under the given time restraints) might have given us<br />\nthe answer.<br />\nIn any event, the survey results tend to disprove<br />\nthe common observation that college students are<br />\napathetic about, and alienated from, the political system. Fully 62 percent of those who responded said they<br />\nwould \"certainly\" or \"probably\" vote. Of those who<br />\nexpected not to, the largest proportion, 43 percent,<br />\nwere legally barred from registering\u2014most of them<br />\nwere simply too young. Only 12 students, or 7.5<br />\npercent of our sample, planned to avoid the ballot box<br />\nas an act of protest. Perhaps these findings should not<br />\nbe too surprising; after all, political sociologists have<br />\nlong known that tht-chances of a person casting a ballot<br />\nincrease with his or her education and affluence\u2014items<br />\nin which we are supposedly rife.<br />\nBut \u2022 perhaps the findings confirm something<br />\nMichael Steele said: \"The country is at a critical point<br />\nThe Polls: What A Difference A Month Makes<br />\nand students are aware of it.\" Maybe the muchfacade.<br />\nWhen the Hopkins chapter of the College Repub- bemoaned Hopkins apathy is no more than a<br />\nlicans canvassed at Homewood September 22-24, they<br />\nNews-Letter staff writers Deborah Jones, Felice<br />\nfound John Anderson in the lead.

KO<br />\nSomeone spent six million dollars<br />\nrecontructing the battered body of an Air<br />\nForce test pilot into Lee Majors. A<br />\ncomparable sum was spent turning the<br />\nactor John Hurt into the greatest freak in<br />\nthe world, the Elephant Man. According<br />\nto his owner, this freak was produced<br />\nnine months after a mad bull elephant<br /><br />\nthe multi-colored turban gourd would<br />\nhave looked out of place, nay,ludicrous).<br />\nWhen I saw Eraserhead for the twenty-fourth time last weekend, it struck me<br />\nthat the movie is a modern version of<br />\nDickens' description of life for the<br />\npoor in the shadow of the factory. The<br />\nsame elements are in the Elephant Man,<br />\nbut actually set in Victorian England:<br /><br />\nDr. Treves reveals the Elephantman to the London Pathological<br />\nbashed an English lady in India. However, !huge, incomprehensible machines squirtto call him the Elephant Man is merely ing clouds of steam, workmen degraded<br />\nsensational advertising.<br />\nInstead he oy mechanical motions, and belching<br />\nlooks like one of the Italian painter smokestacks(the film owes a big debt to<br />\nArcimboldo's heads, constructed out of Fritz Lang's Metropolis). The lower<br />\nfruit and vegetables. His forehead is a classes aren't the surrealed-out wierdos of<br />\nturban gourd; his skull is an overgrown, Eraserhead but classically crude, boozy,<br />\nmisshapen casawba melon; and his back and bawdy types who taunt and exploit<br />\nand right arm are covered with clumps of the freak. The cinematography is also<br />\nreminiscent of Lynch's previous work,<br />\nbroccoli and endive lettuce.<br />\nIn David Lynch's (of Eraserhead especially during the dream sequences.<br />\nfame) new movie adaption of the At the end he again has a large back-lightElephant Man's story, we don't see this ed ball floating on a black background.<br />\nwalking grocery in the flesh until we have The differences in Lynch's handling of<br />\nbeen appropriately tantalized. In one<br />\nscene we see him in his walking clothes:<br />\nblack cape, black hat, and cloth bag<br />\nover his head. He limps along, breathing<br />\nwith difficulty, doing his damnedest to<br />\nlook like Darth Vader (m=genius).<br />\nLynch's subliminal pandering to the fiveto -nine year old age group did not go<br />\nUnnoticed.<br />\nThere are strong parallels between<br />\nthis film and Lynch's student work<br />\nEraserhead. Most obviously, the film is<br />\nblack-and-white(it had to be: if it was in<br />\ncolor the green broccoli and endive and<br /><br />\nthis image illustrate the differences<br />\nbetween the movies. In Eraserhead the<br />\nball explodes and we plunge through the<br />\ndebris into a lake of sperm-like liquid surrealism par excellence. In the Elephant<br />\nMan a photo of the freak's beautiful<br />\nmother is superimposed on the ball and<br />\nstars twinkle around it as a woman's voice<br />\ndeclares that nothing ever dies and<br />\neverything will be all right - sentimentality in excess.<br />\nAs we turn from awful fascination<br />\nto sentimentality, there are a few powerful moments which keep us from drowning in saccharine. When the doctor<br />\n(Anthony Hopkins) who discovered and<br />\ncared for the freak, has to teach him to<br />\ntalk so he won't be kicked out of the<br />\nhospital as a worthless, incurable moron,<br />\nwe are forced to re-evaluate the freak. His<br />\nfirst words seem to come from a mouth<br />\nfull of cotton-wrapped pebbles. As we<br />\ngradually come to understand his reedy<br />\nvoice, we see that he can read and finds<br />\nthe Twenty-Third Psalm moving (sigh).<br />\nThis is our first indication that the freak<br />\nis a gentle, cultured sentimentalist.<br />\nHe has a taste for pictures of other<br />\npeople's attractive relatives (touching),<br />\nfine clothes, and cologne.

TAYLOR<br />\nJosef von Sternberg's The Blue<br />\nAngel (1930) is most famous as the<br />\nvehicle that shot Marlene Dietrich to<br />\ninternational stardom, as the first talking<br />\nfilm made in Germany, and as an expressionist depiction of cabaret life in Germany during the Weimar Republic. The<br />\nfilm portrays the downfall of a pompous<br />\nmiddle-aged high school professor Immanuel Rath, played by Emil Jannings<br />\n- when he falls in love with the cabaret<br />\nsinger, Lola Lola, played by Dietrich.<br />\nThe UFA film company, run by a<br />\nright-wing German nationalist, Alfred<br />\nHugenberg, produced the film. Hugenberg released films that were critical and<br />\ndestructive of the Republic, either<br />\nsatirizing Weimar types, highlighting<br />\nqualities that they lacked, or merely<br />\ncreating confusion about political issues:.<br />\nMetropolis, directed by Fritz Lang, is a<br />\ngood example of a UFA film that confuses its message, in this case the relationship between industrialists and their<br />\nworkers. These films were part of what<br />\nPeter Gay calls \"The cartelization of<br /><br />\nculture\u2014 in preparation for the Nazi<br />\nseizure of powqr in 1933. There seems to<br />\nbe a controversy over whether The Blue<br />\nAngel actually reflects Hugenberg's political ideas whether it is a subtle rightwing critique of the Republic or whether<br />\nit is a psychological profile of social<br />\nbondage.<br />\nWhen we first see Rath, he is<br /><br />\nEmil Jannings as the tortured Prof. Rath<br /><br />\nAnthony Hopkins plays Dr. Treves<br />\nstripped of his mask. He keeps the crowd<br />\nat bay by yelling that he is not an animal<br />\nbut a human. After seeing this movie,<br />\nI felt like going down to the Marble Bar<br />\nand saying to the grotesqueries there,<br />\n\"There, there. I'll find you a nice comfortable hospital room where you can<br />\nseive tea to Baltimore society, make a<br />\npaper model of the factory outside your<br />\nwindow, and prove you're still human.<br />\nAnd I'll be sure never to let a mirror in<br />\nthe room, pimply git.\"<br />\nThe Elephant Man is neither an<br />\nanimal nor a vegetable (nor a mineral,<br />\ndespite his likeness to the Rock of<br />\nGibraltar): he is a gentle human being<br />\nwhose sensitivity borders on affected<br />\nfoppery. I wish Lynch had played more<br />\nwith high society's reaction to the freak<br />\nand the difference between that reaction<br />\nand the lower classes'. He never answers<br />\nthe question of whether society's patronization of the freak is ultimately as<br />\nharmful as the mob's taunts. Nevertheless, the movie is good and serious and<br />\nleaves you with an understanding of the<br />\nresidents of this charming city.<br />\nA final thought: poor Mr. Bowie<br />\n(starring in the unrelated Broadway<br />\nproduction of The Elephant Man)--I just<br />\ncannot see how he became a rock star and<br />\nan idol of millions with such obscene<br />\ndeformities.<br />\nIt's a movie.<br /><br />\nbeginning a safely routine day with<br />\nbreakfast brought in on a tray by a<br />\nhawk-faced housekeeper. The first sign<br />\nthat something is wrong comes when he<br />\nfinds that his pet song bird has died in its<br />\ncage. The housekeeper duly tosses the<br />\nlittle corpse into the furnace. Rath uses<br />\nthe sugar cube that he was going to offer<br />\nhis pet in his own cup of coffee, thus<br />\nidentifying himself with it.<br />\nThe symbolism of the bird in its<br />\ncage follows Rath throughout the film.<br />\nHis classroom is his first cage. Ridiculed<br />\nby his students, he seeks release in music,<br />\nopening the window to listen to a choir<br />\nsinging outside. That night, Rath goes to<br />\na night club, The Blue Angel, in his<br />\nteacher's robes to rout some of his<br />\nstudents who he thinks are entertaining<br />\nthemselves there. As he moves into the<br />\nback streets of the city, he becomes<br />\nentrapped in his surroundings. In the<br />\nfoggy gas-lit night, twisted buildings rise<br />\nat impossible angles to either side of<br />\nRath's figure as he stumbles down narrow<br />\nIn The Blue Angel, a clauslanes.<br />\ntrophobic space is established.

Later to consummate this image, the love-sick Rath<br />\nis fed sugar cubes by Lola Lola. He<br />\nbecomes more birdlike, eventually imitating a cock in obscene and humilating<br />\nsequences, as his self-destruction through<br />\nLola proceeds.<br />\nIn a sense Lola Lola is also Rath's<br />\nsong bird. Like the other chorus singers<br />\nin their feathered costumes, she is<br />\ntrapped in her own role. Rath may see<br />\nher as a lady, but she is really a call girl of<br />\nsorts, stuck in a tawdry show tour circuit.<br />\nShe is amused and flattered by Rath,<br />\nhaving a playful affection for him as a<br />\nfather figure, but because Rath cannot<br />\nsupport her, she cannot sacrifice her<br />\ncareer for him. Rath cannot impose his<br />\nmoral standards on Lola, just as she<br />\ncannot adapt him to the seamy cabaret<br />\nworld, without one destroying the other.<br />\nNumerous scenes in shich Lola and Rath<br />\nare pictured on either side of barred or<br />\ncurtained barriers indicate that they are<br />\nlocked in different cages, each just as<br />\neffective as the other.<br /><br />\nOur eyes are carefully directed to<br />\nmore intricate fore-shadowings of Rath's<br />\nfate. We see repeatedly the fragile parade<br />\nof Daumier-like figures of aged men that<br />\ncircle the base of the school clock.

The play<br /><br />\npresents the relationship between two gay<br />\nmen, Greg and Ward, who share a sublet<br />\napartment in Greenwich Village. Most of<br />\nthe play centers on a patterned game<br />\nbetween the two men that resembles an<br />\nargument.<br />\nThe real dispute begins when<br />\nWard brings home Barry, an egocentric<br />\nleather queen, for the night. Barry<br />\npromptly falls in love with the apartment<br />\nand decides to split up Ward and Greg to<br />\nget it. It is not, however, his attempt to<br />\ntake the apartment, but how Greg and<br />\nWard adjust to the changes in their<br />\nrelationship, which is the most important<br /><br />\nUndergrad Film Workshop<br />\nvON STERNBERG<br /><br />\nBY DEBORAH JONES<br />\nFilmmakers and would-be filmmakers now have the chance to practice<br />\ntheir art in the Undergraduate Film<br />\nWorkshop. The workshop meets the first<br />\nand third Tuesday of each month from<br />\n8:00-10:00 pm in Gilman 110, Its<br />\npurpose is to give students access to film<br />\nand video equipment and knowledge of<br />\nits use. The program, which does not<br />\ncarry academic credit, is designed for<br />\nstudents who have no filmmaking experience, but the workshop can give more<br />\nexperienced students the chance to<br />\nproduce short films and video tapes.<br />\nSeventeen students are presently<br />\ninvolved in the workshop, which was<br />\nstarted by sophomore Mark Hollander, a<br />\nfilm major who has produced five short<br />\nworks, and is also an intern at the Johns<br /><br />\nHopkins Hospital motion picture studio.<br />\n\"The film workshop was started because<br />\nstudents very often find their courses<br />\nplanned for them during their entire four<br />\nyears at Hopkins without the opportunity<br />\nto take a film course for credit,\" he said.<br />\n\"The workshop offers these students a<br />\nchance to produce a film despite their<br />\nschedule restrictions.\"<br />\nThe workshop uses equipment from<br />\nthe now-defunct Media Center. Production is primarily in Super 8, but arrangements may be made for video and 16 mm<br />\nequipment. The equipment may be<br />\nchecked out on a liability contract basis<br />\nMondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from<br />\n11-12. The only cost to students is the<br />\nprice of supplies (film or video tape) and<br />\nprocessing. The next meeting of the<br />\nUndergraduate Film Workshop will be<br />\nheld Tuesday, November 4.<br /><br />\nto the play.<br />\nJoe Uher and Silas White play<br />\nthe roommates Ward and Greg respectively. Both have considerable acting experience, including some work by Uher for<br />\nTheater Hopkins. They perform excellently together in the running argument<br />\non which the play's comedy depends. The<br />\nrapid pace of their argument convinces<br />\nthe audience that it is something<br />\nthey<br />\nlive with every day and is part of the way<br />\nthey get along, rather than a sign of true<br />\nenmity. Lou Kelly as the flighty subletting landlord, and Peter Devons, as Barry,<br />\nboth perform well. Ms. Kelly also has one<br />\nof the best speeches in the play, in which<br />\nshe explains how gay men have forced<br />\nher from various occupations, including<br />\nbeautician and stewardess.<br />\nThe play is directed by Chuck<br />\nMiller of the Fells Point Theater and<br />\nproduced by Jack Taylor. They are<br />\nco-founders of The Theater Closet and<br />\nhave managed to start the group from<br />\nscratch and convert the ground floor of<br />\nwhat used to be a wafehouse into an<br />\nadequate, though small, theater. The<br />\nscript was written and revised for this<br />\nproduction by Doric Wilson. Wilson's<br />\ndialogue is realistic in its depiction of<br />\nmodern gay life. However, the play's<br />\nproblems stem from a late revelation of<br />\nBarry's motive(wanting the apartment)<br />\nthat draws too much attention away from<br />\nGreg and Ward, and also from a few<br />\nextraneous scenarios that seem to do<br />\nlittle to further the plot.<br />\nA Perfect Relationship is solid<br />\ndebut comedy for a new theater group.<br />\nCloset Theater was established this<br />\nsummer to fill the need for a primarily<br />\ngay theater in Baltimore. Its planned<br />\nfuture productions are 'A Late Show (a<br />\nlesbian play), Newsboy (a drama), and<br />\nBoy Meets Boy (a musical). If everything<br />\nworks out, the group hopes to expand to<br />\na five-show season next year.<br />\nPerformances of A Perfect Relationship are Friday and Saturday nights<br />\nat 8:30 and Sunday at 7:00 at the Gay<br />\nCommunity Center, 241 W. Chase Street<br />\n(about a block from the opera house).<br />\nTickets are $3.50 and reservations are<br />\nsuggested for at least the Friday night<br />\nshow (837-5445).<br /><br />\npeople alike: significantly, the ringmasters<br />\nof the misbehaving students are an<br />\ninsolent wealthy boy and a Jew, presented as an insidious trickster. Yet the<br />\nflustered professor seems to ignore his<br />\nstudent Angst, the only person who<br />\nrespects his position and authority. The<br />\nblond, bespectacled Angst, a model of the<br />\ndutiful, hardworking student and a<br />\nhumble picture of the ideal Naziyouth, is<br />\nvictimized by his fellow students. Rath,<br />\nwho might befriend Angst, betrays his<br />\nposition of guidance as the father figure<br />\nby choosing to join the others in publicly<br />\nhumiliating the pathetic Angst. Von<br />\nSternberg seems to be advocating a<br />\nrevitalization of old Germany by an<br />\nalliance with this new nationalistic ideal<br />\nrepresented by Angst. The subplot<br />\ndealing with Angst is so overshadowed by<br />\nRath's relationship with Lola that its<br />\nmessage is obscured. The film only<br />\nconveys a vague feeling of nostalgia and<br />\ndissatisfaction with the present.<br />\nThe power of The Blue Angel,<br />\nwhich overrides and distracts the viewer<br />\nfrom all these implications, rests in the<br />\nemotional impact of Jannings' portrayal<br />\nof Rath's hopeless love for Lola and his<br />\ndespair at the loss of his former life that<br />\ndraws him into a pitiful, and finally<br />\nterrifying, insanity. Jannings creates this<br />\nmood with facial and bodily expression,<br />\nusing very few words. Dietrich has a<br />\nchildish allure for Rath as she casually<br />\ndresses and adjusts her vulgar, awkward<br />\ncostumes in scene after scene. Rath<br />\nresponds to her teasing and her endearing<br />\ncoquettishness with the innocent eagerness of a schoolboy. At the end, the<br />\nviewer is left with a sense that Rath has<br />\nfulfilled his destiny, but also a feeling<br />\nthat nothing has been accomplished by<br />\nthis process of change: nothing has<br />\nchanged, and we are not sure that Rath<br />\nhas learned anything. Rath, whatever he<br />\nonce was, has been wasted. The Blue<br />\nAngel is worth seeing not only as a<br />\ndocument of its times, but also as a<br />\ndramatic and touching tragedy of<br />\nhopeless love.<br />\nThe Blue Angel will be shown Sunday,<br />\nOct. 26 at 7:30 pm in Shriver Hall(sponsored by The Reel World).<br /><br />\nContest<br />\ncvnt.from p. 13<br />\nannounced sometime in February.<br />\nWinning pieces will then be performed in<br />\nthe L-V room or the Glass Pavilion.<br />\nDean Sigmund Suskind has promised to<br />\nmake honorary mention of the contest<br />\nwinners at graduation.

Mike<br />\nCrecco, who had been experiencing a frustrating year, added 64.<br />\nThe effectiveness of the<br />\nBlue Jay rushing game made the<br />\npassing attack even more effective. Forced to come toward the<br />\nline of sccimmage to make<br /><br />\ntackles, the lioya secondary<br />\nmade itself vulnerable, and<br />\nMargraff twice took advantage<br />\nof the situation by faking a<br />\nhandoff into the middle and<br />\npassing to Bill Stromberg for<br />\ntouchdowns; on one such play,<br />\nit was open field running for<br />\nStromberg.

Saturday, October<br />\n11th, the Blue Jays were routed<br />\nby the perpetually strong Ursinus College team. Egged on by a<br />\nfanatic coach and screaming fans<br />\nat every crucial point along the<br />\ncourse, the Beau took the<br />\nfirst four places, with Jon<br />\nPerroto winning the five-mile<br />\nrace in 26:39.7 First across the<br />\nline for Hopkings was Andrew<br />\nBresica in 27:13, followed<br />\nclosely by David Stewart, 27:20.<br />\nThree more Jrsinus runners<br />\ncame in before the next Hopkins<br />\nharrier, Jeff Bickart, made it,<br />\ntaking tenth place in 28:31.<br />\nThe other Hopkins runners were<br />\nJohn Roemer (15th, 29:47)<br />\nBill Shutze (16th, 31:11 ),Dave<br />\nGrinnell (17th, 31:11), and Will<br />\nFeldman (19th, 31:58). Ursinus<br />\nwon, 17-44.<br />\nAt Western Maryland College on the 14th, it was a different story. Even without Dave<br />\nStewart, JHU won easily, 20-35.<br />\nAndrew Brescia ran away from<br />\nthe field and cruised to an<br />\neasy victory, setting a course<br />\nrecord of 26:52 for the hilly<br />\n8000-meter circuit. More that<br />\na minute behind was tiopkins'<br />\nJeff Bickart, who took 2nd place<br />\nin 27:53, barely staying ahead<br />\nof Western Maryland's first<br />\nrunner, John Kebler, who<br />\ncrossed the finish line only eight<br />\nseconds later. Taking it easy,<br />\nbut nevertheless clinching the<br />\nmeet for Hopkins, were John<br />\nRoemer (4th, 29:14), Dave<br />\nGrineel (6th, 30:14), Will<br />\nFeldman (7th, 30:55), and<br />\nMark Kaplan (9th, 31:02). It<br />\nwas an altogether pleasant meet.<br />\nThe easy-going, friendly manner<br />\nof the Western Maryland team<br />\nand coach was in marked con-<br /><br />\ntrast to that of Ursinus.<br />\ner,(8th, 27:18). Following him<br />\nThis past Wednesday, Leb- for Hopkins were Dave Grinpel<br />\nanon Valley College edged out (12th.28:44 ), Bill Shutze (14th,<br />\nHopkins, 27 to 29.<br />\n29:13),<br />\nMark<br />\nKaplan<br />\nJHU's<br />\nAndrew Brescia clocked an ani- (15,29:31), and Will Feldman<br />\nazillg time of 25:01 for the five (16th,30:14)<br />\nThe value of an encouraging<br />\nmiles, setting a course record in<br />\nword to a fatigued runner<br />\ncannot be overestimated. It<br />\nmay be just what he needs to<br />\nmake him go after the guy in<br />\nfront of him. Anyone with half<br />\nan hour to spare this Saturday<br />\nafternoon can find out that<br />\ncross-country really isn't so<br />\nboring and help the Hopkins<br />\nteam as well. Just stand anywhere along San Martin Drive,<br />\nfrom above the BIA field in<br />\nWyman Park to University<br />\nParkway, between 2:00 and<br />\n2:30, and you can watch a<br />\ncontinous stream of runners,<br />\nshout encouraging, uplifting<br />\nthe process.
