Bedding in the siltstone<br />\nand shale ranges from fissile to finely laminated and includes<br />\nintervals with abundant root casts. The arkose occurs in<br />\npoorly defined beds 20 to 100 \u00a2cm (8 to 40 inches) thick.<br />\nThroughout the region, the siltstone-shale-arkose unit<br />\noverlies a basal quartz-pebble conglomerate (\u00ae&nc), which<br />\ncontains subangular to moderately rounded pebbles and<br />\ncobbles of vein quartz up to 12 cm (5 inches) in diameter and<br />\nscattered tabular pebbles of micaceous phyllite in a white to<br />\nred coarse-grained arkosic matrix with interbedded coarse-<br />\ngrained, micaceous arkose. The top of the New Oxford is not<br />\nexposed in the map area.

The name Wakefield is here<br />\n<br />\nrestricted to outcrops in the larger continuous fold belt of<br />\nmarble in the southwest part of the New Windsor and<br />\n<br />\nadjacent Union Bridge quadrangles, such as in the Wakefield<br />\nValley, where it is associated with a broad belt of the<br />\n<br />\nmetabasalts of the Sams Creek Formation. (Smaller areas of<br />\nmarble outcrops occur within other lithologic units and are<br />\nherein mapped simply as a marble within those other units.)<br />\n<br />\nAt the interpreted base, the Wakefield marble is a reddish or<br />\nbuff interval that contains numerous chloritic partings and<br />\nrare blocks of amygdaloidal metabasalt; stratigraphically<br />\n<br />\nhigher, the marble is light gray to white and contains little<br />\nchlorite. A silvery blue muscovite-chlorite phyllite (\u20acZwmp)<br />\noccupies an axial position in one part of the synformal<br />\n<br />\nstructure near the center of the quadrangle. Its actual<br />\n<br />\nstratigraphic relationship to the marble is unclear, but is here<br />\nplaced at the top of the marble because of its location on a<br />\nsynclinal axis.

The metabasalt consists primarily of<br />\nfine-grained chlorite, actinolite, albite, epidote, and quartz<br />\nwith minor sphene and magnetite. It commonly contains<br />\nflattened and stretched blebs of chlorite and amygdules filled<br />\nwith concentric layers of chlorite, quartz, epidote, and<br />\nankerite. The amygdules are concentrated in zones of<br />\nfragmental hematitic metabasalt 0.5 to 3 m (1.5 to 10 feet)<br />\nthick, which Fisher (1978) interpreted as possibly being relict<br />\nflow tops. Pods up to 20 cm (8 inches) long of metabasalt,<br />\nlargely replaced by epidote, locally give the rock a coarse,<br />\nnodular appearance.

Bedding in the siltstone<br />\nand shale ranges from fissile to finely laminated and includes<br />\nintervals with abundant root casts. The arkose occurs in<br />\npoorly defined beds 20 to 100 \u00a2cm (8 to 40 inches) thick.<br />\nThroughout the region, the siltstone-shale-arkose unit<br />\noverlies a basal quartz-pebble conglomerate (\u00ae&amp;nc), which<br />\ncontains subangular to moderately rounded pebbles and<br />\ncobbles of vein quartz up to 12 cm (5 inches) in diameter and<br />\nscattered tabular pebbles of micaceous phyllite in a white to<br />\nred coarse-grained arkosic matrix with interbedded coarse-<br />\ngrained, micaceous arkose. The top of the New Oxford is not<br />\nexposed in the map area. Of a total thickness of about 250 m<br />\n(820 feet), only 20 to 90 m (65 to 300 feet) is thought to<br />\noccur in the New Windsor quadrangle.<br /><br /><br /><br />\nWESTMINSTER TERRANE<br /><br />\nWakefield Marble<br /><br />\nMassive to thickly bedded reddish, light gray, or white<br /><br />\ndolomite-calcite marble. The name Wakefield is here<br /><br />\nrestricted to outcrops in the larger continuous fold belt of<br />\nmarble in the southwest part of the New Windsor and<br /><br />\nadjacent Union Bridge quadrangles, such as in the Wakefield<br />\nValley, where it is associated with a broad belt of the<br /><br />\nmetabasalts of the Sams Creek Formation. (Smaller areas of<br />\nmarble outcrops occur within other lithologic units and are<br />\nherein mapped simply as a marble within those other units.)<br /><br />\nAt the interpreted base, the Wakefield marble is a reddish or<br />\nbuff interval that contains numerous chloritic partings and<br />\nrare blocks of amygdaloidal metabasalt; stratigraphically<br /><br />\nhigher, the marble is light gray to white and contains little<br />\nchlorite. A silvery blue muscovite-chlorite phyllite (\u20acZwmp)<br />\noccupies an axial position in one part of the synformal<br /><br />\nstructure near the center of the quadrangle. Its actual<br /><br />\nstratigraphic relationship to the marble is unclear, but is here<br />\nplaced at the top of the marble because of its location on a<br />\nsynclinal axis. This phyllite does not crop out, but is<br /><br />\nrecognized only as weathered fragments in dark-brown<br /><br />\nclayey soil.<br /><br />\nSams Creek Formation<br /><br />\nSilver Run Limestone Member<br /><br />\nLight bluish gray to medium gray, thin- to medium-bedded,<br />\nlocally laminated argillaceous limestone with stratification<br />\nup to 10 cm (4 inches) thick. Locally interbedded with tan<br />\nmuscovite-chlorite phyllite \u20acCZscsrp). This phyllite does not<br />\ncrop out, occurring only as weathered chips in the clay<br />\nresiduum. Some of the thicker limestone beds grade upward<br />\nfrom calcite at the base to argillaceous dolomite at the top.<br />\nThe limestone is poorly exposed, except along a few stream<br />\nvalleys; weathers rapidly to a moderately thick residuum.<br /><br />\nMetabasalt<br /><br />\nSchistose to massive metabasalt (\u201cgreenstone\u2122) interlayered<br />\nwith green to blue chlorite phyllite and minor gray hematite-<br />\nmuscovite phyllite. The metabasalt consists primarily of<br />\nfine-grained chlorite, actinolite, albite, epidote, and quartz<br />\nwith minor sphene and magnetite. It commonly contains<br />\nflattened and stretched blebs of chlorite and amygdules filled<br />\nwith concentric layers of chlorite, quartz, epidote, and<br />\nankerite. The amygdules are concentrated in zones of<br />\nfragmental hematitic metabasalt 0.5 to 3 m (1.5 to 10 feet)<br />\nthick, which Fisher (1978) interpreted as possibly being relict<br />\nflow tops. Pods up to 20 cm (8 inches) long of metabasalt,<br />\nlargely replaced by epidote, locally give the rock a coarse,<br />\nnodular appearance. Most of the rock has a schistose texture,<br />\nbut in places porphyritic basaltic texture is well preserved.<br />\nQuartz-epidote veins 0.2 to 10 cm thick commonly parallel<br />\nthe main schistosity. This is the characteristic lithology of<br />\nthe Sams Creek Formation in its original designation.<br />\nCorresponds to the Sams Creek greenstone (scgs) of Fisher<br /><br />\nA ONTON 1 .<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nLate Proterozoic to Cambrian?<br /><br />\n\u20acZsc<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\u20acZscm<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\u20acZscmp<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nMica-chlorite-quartz phyllite<br /><br />\nLight-tan to light-grayish-green. The micas and chlorite are<br />\ntypically segregated into prominent pinstripe laminations<br />\nspaced 1 to 3 cm (0.4 to 1.2 inches) apart and parallel to<br />\ncleavage. Resistant to weathering; crops out extensively and<br />\ncommonly forms low ridges capped by a thin sandy soil.<br />\nCorresponds to the Ijamsville mica-chlorite-quartz phyllite<br />\n(ygp) of Fisher (1978) that crops out west of the Avondale<br />\nfault.<br /><br />\nMarble<br /><br />\nTypically light gray to white, massive dolomitic marble.<br />\nIsolated or discontinuous pod-like lensoidal bodies of marble<br />\nthat crop out west of the Avondale fault and previously<br />\nmapped as Wakefield Marble, but whose stratigraphic<br />\nequivalency cannot be established. These marble bodies may<br />\nor may not be at the same stratigraphic level as the main belt<br />\nof Wakefield Marble in Wakefield Valley. Moderately well<br />\nexposed in places; occupies topographic depressions and<br />\nweathers to a thin red soil, locally covered by slope wash<br />\nfrom adjacent hills. Three small areas of carbonate rock<br />\nwithin a narrow belt of Sams Creek metabasalt (CZsca) at<br />\nFountain Valley, west of Westminster, were mapped as the<br />\nSilver Run by Fisher (1978). However, two of the three<br />\nareas contain quarries that expose light gray marble and not<br />\nthe gray limestone typical of the Silver Run. Therefore,<br />\nthese three areas were reassigned to the Wakefield Marble<br />\n(Edwards, unpublished data, 1996), but are now shown as<br />\n(\u20acZscm).
