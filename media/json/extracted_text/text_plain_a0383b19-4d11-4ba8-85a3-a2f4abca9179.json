According the U.S.<br />\ncommerce reports, Boorstein<br />\npointed out, 22 American<br />\ncompanies owned 75% of the best<br />\nland in Cuba. The companies were<br />\ninterested in selling in the<br />\nAmerican market, not in<br />\nproviding foodstuffs for the<br />\nCuban people. So large amounts<br />\nof land remained idle and the rest<br />\nwas used for the highly unstable,<br />\nc om m o di t y--sugar. Meanwhile,<br />\n\"the bulk of the Cuban people<br />\nwere impoverished, landless, rural<br />\nwage earners, unemployed<br />\n25-50% of the time.\"<br />\n\"This kind of economy,\"<br />\ndeclared Boorstein, \"did not<br />\nhappen by itself.\" At the close of<br />\nthe Spanish American War the<br />\nU.S. occupied Cuba. According to<br />\nBoorstein, only when the Cubans<br />\nagreed to the Platt Amendment<br />\nwhich gave the U.S. the right to<br />\nintervene militarily to protect life<br />\nand property did the occupation<br />\nend. The U.S. intervened<br />\nmilitarily in 1906, 1912 and<br />\n1917. \"How do you think Cubans<br />\nfelt,\" inquired Boorstein, \"when<br />\nmilitary troops came in?\"<br />\n\"If the majority of Americans<br />\nhad to live under that kind of<br />\nsystem (some of us do) we'd be<br />\nup in arms\".<br />\nAlso \"rammed down the<br />\nCubans' throats\" was a reciprical<br />\ntrade agreement: This served,<br />\nargued Boorstein, to suffocate<br />\ninfant Cuban industry which<br />\ncould not compete with American<br />\ngoods on the free market.<br />\nAbraham Lincoln, Boorstein<br />\nnoted ironically, \"was a believer<br />\nin protection for infant industry<br />\nback when Britain was developed<br />\nand the U.S. was not. But when<br />\nwe became the more developed<br />\nnation we began to believe in<br />\nreciprocal trade agreements.\"<br />\nIn 1933, the Cuban people<br />\nrebelled against Antonio<br />\nManchette, a dictator known as<br />\nthe \"Butcher\". Sumner Wells,<br />\nexplained Boorstein \"was sent by<br />\nRoosevelt to defend American<br />\nbusiness interest.\" After a series<br />\nof palace revolts, encouraged by<br />\nWells to forestall revolution, San<br />\nMartin came to power. San Martin<br />\nwas under pressure to nationalize<br />\nAmerican businesses and the U.S.<br />\nre fused his government<br />\nrecognition. Wells manipulated<br />\nbehind the scenes; the marines<br />\nwere mobilized; warships went<br />\ninto Cuban waters. Batista was<br />\ninstalled into power and was<br />\nimmediately recognized by the<br />\nU.S.<br />\n\"This was not done under a<br />\nreactionary president,\" Boorstein<br />\npointed out. \"Rather it was done<br />\nunder a liberal, Franklin<br />\nRoosevelt.\" Likewise, Boorstein<br />\nemphasized that the heads of the<br />\ncorporations which created the<br />\ninhuman conditions in Cuba<br />\n<br />\nTHE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY 1<br />\nON CAMPUS<br />\nUM<br />\n<br />\nThis Sunday - 10:30 A.M.<br />\n<br />\nAnother \"Multi-Media\" Mass<br />\nFilm: \"That's Me\" with Alan Arkin<br />\n<br />\nSHAFFER HALL Rm.3<br />\n<br />\n\"were proper people acting<br />\nwithout malice.

ORNSTEIN<br />\nLast week the Academic<br />\nCouncil once again demonstrated<br />\nthat Hopkins is no academic<br />\ncommunity. This supreme<br />\nacademic body of the University<br />\nemasculated a request for student<br />\nrepresentation and unanimously<br />\nvoted to set up a token<br />\n\"Committee on Student<br />\nRelations\". This committee will<br />\nserve only to duplicate presently<br />\nexisting channels of<br />\ncommunication between students<br />\nand the Council.<br />\nWith the support of status<br />\nquo-oriented undergraduate<br />\nrepresentatives, conservative<br />\nmembers of the Council turned<br />\ndown a proposal made by the<br />\nGraduate Club to seat two<br />\ngraduate students and two<br />\nundergraduates. It went so far as<br />\nto deny the request of one of its<br />\nstanding committees, the<br />\nGraduate Board, to include<br />\nstudents in its deliberations. This,<br />\nin spite of the fact that the<br />\nGraduate Board had itself<br />\nunanimously requested this<br />\nrepresentation. The Council also<br />\nreduced, from four to two, the<br />\nnumber of students sitting on the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies.<br />\nIn order to \"establish a<br />\ncontinuing point of contact\" with<br />\nstudents the Council set up the<br />\nCommittee on Students<br />\nRelations. And this fits in very<br />\nnicely with the liberal rhetoric<br />\nabout the need for \"openness\"<br />\nand \"communication\" and<br />\n\"understanding\" within our<br />\ninstitutions. But that isn't what<br />\nthe Graduate Club was requesting.<br />\nWhat it asked for was a real role<br />\n<br />\nfor students in the<br />\ndecision-making in the University,<br />\nnot only consultation \"contact\",<br />\nbut also a real voice and some<br />\nmeasure of power.<br />\n\"Powerless\" Students<br />\nLet us have a look at the way<br />\nin which the Academic Council<br />\nhas chosen to view Hopkins. It<br />\nsees a dichotomized University,<br />\nwith powerless students on the<br />\nother. Students are here to learn<br />\nand are thought of as transitory<br />\ncustomers. They have no real<br />\ninterest in the University and no<br />\ncompetence to judge what is good<br />\nfor Hopkins as a whole, or for<br />\nthemselves in particular. Graduate<br />\nstudents, who play a vital and<br />\nindispensable role in research, are<br />\ndenied representation on a<br />\ncommittee concerned solely with<br />\ntheir own affairs.<br />\nWhat are the arguments against<br />\nstudent membership? First there<br />\nis the \"all this doesn't mean<br />\nanything to students anyway\"<br />\nargument. But look at some of<br />\nthe things the Council<br />\nconsiders--like degree<br />\nrequirements and who gets<br />\npromoted and our stand on the<br />\nnew federal law cutting off aid to<br />\nstudents who obstruct the<br />\nUniversity. These are certainly<br />\nrelevant matters. Students are<br />\ncertainly not incompetent to deal<br />\nwith them.<br />\nAnd perhaps students on the<br />\nAcademic Council could do<br />\nconstructive things too, like doing<br />\nsomething to raise the abysmal<br />\nwages paid the University's<br />\nemployees or try to get more<br />\nblack students admitted. Maybe<br />\nsomething could be done to<br />\nimprove the horrible teaching<br />\n<br />\nitandards at Hopkins.<br />\nThen why are the members of<br />\nthe Academic Council so afraid of<br />\njust a few students? Other<br />\nUniversitites have such<br />\nrepresentation, and they have not<br />\ncollapsed into chaos. At least one<br />\nCouncil member has made the<br />\nargument that student<br />\nrepresentation would destroy the<br />\nconfidentiality of its meetings,<br />\nand with it the atmosphere of a<br />\ncouncil of peers.<br />\nNot Corporation<br />\nBut what is the meaning of this<br />\n\"confidentiality\"? In its motion<br />\npresented to the Council, the<br />\nGraduate Club also called for<br />\nopen meetings. What members of<br />\nthe Council must realize is that a<br />\nuniversity is not so simply a<br />\ncorporation turning out research<br />\nas efficiently as possible. Secrecy<br />\ncan only serve to make us less a<br />\ncommunity. What we must strive<br />\nfor is a university where each<br />\nmember, be he student, faculty,<br />\nadministrator or employee, takes<br />\na part in the decision-making<br />\nprocess.<br />\nThe Academic Council sets the<br />\ntone for the whole University. If<br />\nwe decry an undergraduate<br />\nrepresentative's acting as the<br />\n\"moderate\" spokesman of<br />\nreaction, if speak of the isolation<br />\nof many Hopkins students, we<br />\nhave only to look to this supreme<br />\ngoverning body to see who sets<br />\nthe style.<br />\nSooner or later there will be<br />\nstudent representation on the<br />\nAcademic Council,just as it exists<br />\nat many other universities. Why<br />\nnot now? It would make Hopkins<br />\na better place.<br />\n<br />\nIGlee Club \"Fairy\" Talel<br />\nBy TIM STOCKS<br />\nThere is a charming story<br />\nrelating the supposed strangement<br />\nand reconciliation of King George<br />\n1 and George Frederic Handel. It<br />\nseems that Handel was the court<br />\ncomposer for the Elector of<br />\nHanover. One day Fred., as he<br />\nwas known to his intimates,,<br />\napproached the Elector and said,<br />\n\"Sire, I wonder if I might take a<br />\nfew months off and visit<br />\nEngland.\"<br />\nThe Elector said that a few<br />\nmonths would be all right but<br />\ncautioned Handel to return to<br />\nbeautiful Hanover soon. Handel<br />\nwent to England and found things<br />\nso pleasant that he overstayed his<br />\nleave. One can well imagine his<br />\nirritation when his former<br />\nemployer ascended the English<br />\nthrone as King George I. In order<br />\nto regain his former employer's<br />\nfavor, Handel composed a musical<br />\npetition - Water Musick. The story<br />\ngoes on to say that the King was<br />\nso pleased by this composition<br />\nthat Handel was again the beloved<br />\nemployee.<br />\nUnfortunately this tale is<br />\nuntrue.<br />\nThere is another charming<br />\nstory going around. It seems that<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nGlee Club, The Johns Hopkins<br />\nSchool of Nursing Chorus, five<br />\nsoloists and one organist under<br />\nthe baton of Ellery B. Woodworth<br />\ngave one of the best performances<br />\nof Handel's Messiah witnessed by<br />\nman.<br />\nJust as the other Handel story<br />\nisn't true, this story isn't true.<br />\nOne could never make a<br />\ncomprehensive listing of all the<br />\nflaws cround into this production<br />\n<br />\nof Ha-riders oratorio.' A partial<br />\nreport will have to do. The alto<br />\nchoked up on \"Behold a virgin<br />\nshall conceive.\" Admittedly this is<br />\nsomewhat improbable, but she<br />\ndid have time to accustom herself<br />\nto the notion. The soprano was<br />\nplagued by imprecision in \"There<br />\nwere shepherds abiding in the<br />\nfields\" and subsequent sections.<br />\nThe second soprano's lack of<br />\nbreath control was painfully<br />\napparent in \"Rejoice greatly, a<br />\ndaughter of Zion.\" The tenor,<br />\nwhile not bothered by technical<br />\nerrors, showed that stoicism can<br />\nruin an otherwise perfect<br />\nrendition. A good example of this<br />\nlack of emotion was found in the<br />\naria, \"Though shalt break them<br />\nwith a rod or iron, Thou shalt<br />\ndash them like a potter's vessel.\"<br />\nUnfortunately, his voice got<br />\nacross the concept of dashing and<br />\nbreaking about as well as George<br />\nWallace's voice got across the<br />\nfeeling of Christian concern for<br />\nhis fellow man. With regard to the<br />\nbass, one cannot find as much<br />\nfault. While it is true that on<br />\noccasion he wavered it was, all in<br />\nall, a competent bit of work.<br />\nUndoubtedly, the weakest was<br />\nthe chorus. Their total<br />\nperformance could be heard in<br />\nmicrocosm during the famed<br />\nHallelujah Chorus. There is a<br />\ntradition of standing up during<br />\nthe chorus which dates to one of<br />\nthe earlier productions of Messiah<br />\nunder Handers supervision. The<br />\nKing of England (that stalwart of<br />\nHandel stories) attended the<br />\nperformance, sitting quietly<br />\nthroughout. For no apparent<br />\nreason (maybe he wanted to<br />\nstretlic his legs) when the first<br />\n<br />\n\"Hallelujah!\" rang out, he stood<br />\nup. Since no loyal subject of the<br />\nKing may remain seated while his<br />\nmonarch stands, the whole<br />\naudience stood up. Somehow this<br />\npointless custom has survived and<br />\naudiences everywhere will<br />\nlemming-like leap to their<br />\ncollective feet at the first notes of<br />\nthe Hallelujah Chorus. Evidently<br />\nEllery B. Woodworth had no faith<br />\nin our lemming instincts as he<br />\ninformed us beforehand of the<br />\nnecessity of standing.<br />\nThe chorus spattered out the<br />\nfirst \"Hallelujah!\" and I found<br />\nmyself torn between two<br />\nconflicting reactions. One was<br />\nthat of hilarity and the other was<br />\nto commit Hopkins' first mass<br />\nmurder. However, I suppressed<br />\nmy desires and discovered that<br />\nwhen I ignored the myriads of<br />\nmissed notes, the ragged entrances<br />\nand the over-all lack of precision,<br />\nwe could say in truth that their<br />\nvoices were lousy.<br />\nSurprise<br />\nAs I walked in back of the<br />\npower plant towards Charles<br />\nStreet I saw a corpulent man<br />\ndressed in a style outdated for<br />\nover two hundred years pacing<br />\nabout, approximately seven feet<br />\nabove the ground. Back and forth<br />\nhe paced, muttering imprecations<br />\nand flailing the air with his arms. I<br />\ncrept up silently, fearing for my<br />\nexistence, yet irrepressibly drawn<br />\ntowards him. When I was<br />\napproximately five feet from him<br />\nhe stopped his aerial ambulations<br />\nand held me in his ghastly gaze.<br />\nBefore dematerializing he sighed<br />\nand muttered, \"I never should<br />\nhave left beautiful Hanover.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\n-^<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, DEC. 13,1968<br />\n<br />\nCorrespondence<br />\nMISUNDERSTANDING<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nFor the benefit of my anxious<br />\nfriends and relatives who have not<br />\nyet succeeded in getting in touch<br />\nwith me, I would appreciate it if<br />\nyou would publish this letter<br />\nstating that I am not the<br />\nimperialist Gordon\" who was<br />\nexecuted last week.

Your neighbors may drive<br />\na better car; gas station attendants<br />\nmay intimidate you; your wife<br />\nmay dominate you; the State<br />\nLegislature may shit on you; but<br />\nin the classroom, by God,<br />\nstudents do what you say - or<br />\nelse. The grade is a hell of a<br />\nweapon. It may not rest on your<br />\nhip, potent and rigid like a cop's<br />\ngun, but in the long run it's more<br />\npowerful. At your personal whim<br />\n- any time you choose - you can<br />\nkeep 35 students up for nights<br />\nand have the pleasure of seeing<br />\nthem walk into the classroom<br />\npasty-faced and. red-eyed carrying<br />\na sheaf of typewritten pages, with<br />\ntitle page, MLA footnotes and<br />\nmargins set at 15 and 91.<br />\nTimidity<br />\nThe 'general timidity which<br />\ncauses teachers, to make .niggers of<br />\ntheir students usually includes a<br />\nfear of the<br />\nmore - specific fear<br />\nstudents themselves. After all,<br />\nstudents are different, just like<br />\nblack people. You stand exposed<br />\nin front of them, knowing that<br />\ntheir interests; their values and<br />\ntheir language are different from<br />\nyours. To make matters worse,<br />\nyou. may suspect that you<br />\nyourself are not the most<br />\nengaging of persons. What then<br />\ncan protect you from their<br />\nridicule and scorn?

He should encourage<br />\nt hem not to need him -eventually or even immediately.<br />\nBut this is rarely the case.<br />\nTeachers Make themselves high<br />\npriests of arcane mysteries. They<br />\nbecome masters of<br />\ninumbo-jumbo. Even a more or<br />\nless conscientious teaclier may be<br />\ntorn between the desire to give<br />\nand the desire to hold them in<br />\nbondage to hint. I can find no<br />\nother explanation that accounts<br />\nfor the way my own subject.<br />\nliterature, is generally taught.<br />\n<br />\nLiterature, which ought to be a<br />\nsource of joy, solace and<br />\nenlightenment, often becomes in<br />\nthe classroom nothing more than<br />\na source of anxiety \u2014 at best an<br />\narena for expertise, a ledger book<br />\nfor the ego. Literature teachers<br />\noften afraid to join a real union<br />\nnonetheless may practice the<br />\nworst kind of trade-unionism in<br />\nthe classroom? they do to<br />\nliterature what Beckmesser does<br />\nto song in Wagner's<br />\n\"Meistersinger.\" The avowed<br />\npurpose of English departments is<br />\nto teach literature; too often their<br />\nreal function is to kill it.<br />\nDark Reason<br />\nFinally, there's the darkest<br />\nreason of all for the master-slave<br />\napproach to education. The less<br />\ntrained and the less socialized a<br />\nperson is, the more he constitutes<br />\na sexual threat and the more he<br />\nwill be subjugated by institutions,<br />\nsuch as penitentiaries and schools.<br />\nMany of us are aware of now of<br />\nthe sexual neurosis which makes<br />\nwhite man so fearful of integrated<br />\nschools and neighborhoods, and<br />\nwhich makes the castration of<br />\nNe'groes a deeply entrenched<br />\nSouthern folkway. We should<br />\nrecognize a similar pattern in<br />\neducation. There is a kind of<br />\ncastration that goes on in schools.<br />\nIt begins before school years, with<br />\nparents' first encroachments on<br />\ntheir children's free unashamed<br />\nsexuality and continues right up<br />\nto the day when they hand you<br />\nyour doctoral diploma with a<br />\nbleeding, shriveled pair of testicles<br />\nstapled to the parchment. It's not<br />\nthat sexuality has no place in the<br />\nclassroom. You'll find it there but<br />\nonly in certain perverted and<br />\nvitiated forms.<br />\nBleeding Brains<br />\nHow does sex show up in<br />\nschool? First of all, there's the<br />\nsado-masochistic relationship<br />\nbetween teachers and students.<br />\nThat's plenty sexual, although the<br />\nprice of enjoying it is to be<br />\nunaware of what's happening. In<br />\nwalks the student in his Ivy<br />\nLeague equivalent of a motor<br />\ncycle jacket. In walks the teacher<br />\n- a kind of intellectual rough trade<br />\n- and flogs his students with no<br />\ngrades, tests, sarcasm and snotty<br />\nsuperiority until their very brains<br />\nare bleeding. In Swinburne's<br />\nEngland, the whipped school boy<br />\nfrequently gres up to be a<br />\nflagellant. With us the perversion<br />\nis intellectual but It's no less<br />\nperverse.<br />\nSex also shows up in the<br />\nclassroom as academic subject<br />\nmatter - sanitized and abstracted,<br />\nthroughly divorced from feeling.<br />\nYou get \"sex education\" now in<br />\nboth high school and college<br />\nclasses: everyone determined not<br />\nto be embarrassed, to be very up<br />\nto date, very contempo. These are<br />\nthe classes for which sex, as<br />\nFeiffer puts it, \"can be a beautiful<br />\nthing if properly administered.\"<br />\nAnd then, of course, there's still<br />\nanother depressing manifestation<br />\nof sex \u2022 in the classroom: the<br />\n\"off-color\" teacher, who keeps<br />\nhis class awake with sniggering<br />\nsexual allusions, obscene titters<br />\nand academic inuendo.

We knew that<br />\npolice brutality was a technique<br />\nof exploitation\u2014to keep the<br />\ncommunity in its place. So we<br />\nfought this which was to the<br />\nPower structure of Baltimore a<br />\nvery unwelcomed fight. In 1942<br />\nthe NAACP formed a citywide<br />\ncommittee, The Citizens for<br />\nJustice, and we had a march of<br />\n2,000 citizens on Annapolis. We<br />\nhad had six killings by police in<br />\n18 months climaxed by the<br />\nshooting of a black soldier in the<br />\nback by, it was said, a drunken<br />\npoliceman...We channeled these<br />\ntensions on the march on<br />\nAnnapolis because we could get<br />\nno redress from the police<br />\ncommissioner, the grand jury<br />\nindicted the policeman only to<br />\nreverse the decision a few days<br />\nlater, and we wired the governor,<br />\nbut he did not answer us. As a<br />\nresult of the march and a meeting<br />\nWith the governor at that time, he<br />\n(the governor) appointed the first<br />\ninter-racial commission which<br />\nlater was sanctioned by the<br />\nlegislature. The commission<br />\ninvestigated the shooting incident<br />\nand later tackled other black<br />\nproblems... A report issued by the<br />\ncommission recommended that<br />\naction be taken by the grand jury<br />\nagainst the police offer, and, more<br />\nimportant, it said the police<br />\ncommissioner should conduct<br />\ndepartment hearings on<br />\ndisciplining his own men... This<br />\nstarted a whole new nationwide<br />\nPattern of police review of their<br />\nactions...<br />\nFirst In South<br />\nFrom the petitions we made<br />\nafter the 1 954 desegregation<br />\ndecision by the Supreme Court,<br />\nBaltimore was the first city south<br />\nof the Mason-Dixon Line to<br />\nintegrate their public. The same<br />\nboard of education which refused<br />\nto desegregate before the court<br />\nruling, was the same one that<br />\nWent on the Voice of America...<br />\nN-L - Going back once more to<br />\nCORE's views, they look upon<br />\nthe ghettos as something<br />\npermanent. You seemed to<br />\nhave implied that they are not<br />\npermanent.<br />\nMitchell - Yes, we do not look at<br />\nthe ghettos as CORE presumes<br />\nthem to be as permanent<br />\nfixtures of American life. We<br />\nsee their gradual<br />\ndisa \u2022 iearance\u2014and that is very<br />\n<br />\nComplete Bachelor<br />\nService<br />\nFluff Dry & Fold<br />\nShirts - Dry Cleaning<br />\n<br />\nsoon. We have faith in the<br />\nAmerican promise\u2014that we are<br />\ngoing to have equal<br />\nopportunity to live whatever<br />\nwe can afford to buy and to<br />\nget the education and job<br />\nopportunities that our talents<br />\ncan achieve. We haven't given<br />\nup, and we are almost over the<br />\nhill legally and we will not give<br />\nup now...<br />\nBlack Capitalism<br />\nOn black capitalism, I think<br />\nthat it is no accident that a<br />\nconservative Nixon would make<br />\nas his campaign platform his<br />\ninterest in helping black<br />\ncapitalism because that is really<br />\nsegregation, and I think that<br />\ngroups such as CORE are fooled<br />\nby this idea. Nixon won on the<br />\nbacklash vote. The NAACP is not<br />\nfooled. We are headed for the<br />\nmainstream of American<br />\neconomic life. And we won't be<br />\nsidetracked by running a few<br />\nblack gas stations or shoe shining<br />\ncorners. We want to see blacks<br />\nand whites together running the<br />\nindustries...<br />\nN-L - Some radical groups,such as<br />\nthe Black Panthers and CORE<br />\nclaim that the white<br />\ncommunity will not grant de<br />\nfacto freedom to blacks. Do<br />\nyou see any recent trends to<br />\nrefute this?<br />\nMitchell - It's not a question of<br />\nwhether the whites are willing<br />\nto give us freedom, but by the<br />\nuse of the ballot they will have<br />\nto listen to us. There are two<br />\nsources of power in America,<br />\neconomic and political.<br />\nThrough political means we<br />\naim to get the economic<br />\npower.<br />\nSome think it is more easy<br />\nand more direct to throw a<br />\nMolotov cocktail than to go<br />\ndoor-to-door and register. We<br />\ndon't see it that way. We have<br />\nto educate our people that in a<br />\ndemocracy we have the tools<br />\nto correct injustices. These<br />\nyoung radicals laugh at the<br />\nlaws, but as a result of our<br />\ncrusade for 1965 Voting<br />\nRights Act and the 1957 Act,<br />\nwhich was before the March on<br />\nWashington, before the sit-ins<br />\nand the like, we have gotten<br />\nhundreds of thousands of<br />\nNegroes registered in the<br />\nSouth, and. have elected<br />\njustices of the peace, county<br />\nclerks, and other openings.<br />\nN-L - Concerning Hopkins, the<br />\nBlack Student Union wants, as<br />\npart of its charter, tO exclude<br />\nall whites. What is your...<br />\nMitchell - Ridiculous. And I<br />\noppose it, and I think it is<br />\nundemocratic and<br />\nun-American. The NAACP has<br />\nfought against segregation<br />\nagainst Negroes in fraternity<br />\n<br />\nhouses. For Negroes at this<br />\ndate to call for the exclusion<br />\nof another race is racism at its<br />\nworst. We can ill afford it.<br />\nN-L - Could you please tell us<br />\nabout the Carl Murphy Affair?<br />\nMitchell - He was a Negro<br />\ngraduate of Howard University.<br />\nHe applied to Hopkins<br />\ngraduate school in 1915, and<br />\nwas rejected on the grounds<br />\nthat Hopkins, though a private<br />\nschool, could follow the<br />\nseparate but equal ruling, and<br />\nit chose to not allow Negroes<br />\nin.<br />\nN-L - Did he ever get in?<br />\nMitchell - No. It was not until<br />\nfairly recently that Hopkins let<br />\ndown the barriers.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from Page 10)<br />\n<br />\nEducational oppression is have immense unused power.<br />\nunderneath the pctti-pants, the<br />\ntrickier to fight than racial They could, theoretically, insist<br />\nchinos and the flannels.

Notes<br />\nBy GEORGE KIRSCHBAUM<br />\nThe BIA recently released the<br />\ntrophy point totals for the Fall<br />\nSeason. The BIA has adopted a<br />\nnew simplified scoring system for<br />\nthe major sports. The adoption of<br />\nthe new system reduces much of<br />\nthe confusion inherent in the old<br />\nsystem. Phi Gam, the 1966-67<br />\nf....lernity champs, lead this year's<br />\ncontenders, but they are being<br />\nclosely pursued by six other<br />\nfraternities, all within twenty-five<br />\npoints of Phi Gam's 117. Adams<br />\nHouse which last won the<br />\nfreshman trophy in 1965-66 look<br />\nlike the favorites this year. In the<br />\nupperclass dorms, Wood House<br />\nhas a slim lead over Willard<br />\nHouse.<br />\nGam Leads Fraternities<br />\nPhi Gamma Delta combined<br />\nfirst place in the Goucher Gallop<br />\nwith a second place in tennis and<br />\na .500 record in football to nail<br />\ndown first place in the trophy<br />\npoint standings. TEP, this year's<br />\nfraternity football champs,<br />\nfollows closely with 115 points,<br />\n<br />\ncast. Fortunately for the record<br />\nbook, Lebanon Valley was worse,<br />\nboasting no outstanding players<br />\nand two regulars that didn't score<br />\nat all. And so by a stroke of luck,<br />\nthe locals escaped, 66-59.<br />\nNo so fortunately, Haverford<br />\nshowed up with a decent team.<br />\nNot good, but decent. While our<br />\nheroes were wallowing along, four<br />\nof the Fords' starting quintet hit<br />\nin double figures, and the score<br />\nwas reversed, 76-62. Again Berke<br />\nand Rebo played creditable<br />\noffensive games, picking up<br />\nthirty-five points between them,<br />\nbut were outshined by the<br />\nconspicuous absence of the other<br />\nthree Jay players.<br />\nAs a team, Hopkins hit for<br />\nonly about thirty percent from<br />\nthe floor and missed a third of<br />\ntheir free throws. Despite this,<br />\nthey might still have won with<br />\nsome crisp ball-handling and some<br />\nhustle under the boards. As it<br />\nturned out, the Fords were no<br />\nshooting giants either, but<br />\ngenerally more polished play gave<br />\nthem twelve more scoring<br />\nopportunities from the floor and<br />\nHopkins five fewer chances from<br />\nthe foul line.<br />\nSwathmore Next<br />\nComing up next is an<br />\nencounter with Swathmore<br />\nSaturday.

One of the reasons for<br />\nthis stellar victory was the play of<br />\nsenior co-captain, Brian Berke.<br />\nBrian personifies the Hopkins<br />\n. athlete. In high school he was not<br />\nthe most sought after prospect on<br />\nhis team, but he did have offers<br />\nfrom several big schools.<br />\nHowever, Brian, like so many<br />\nothers, choses Hopkins as he<br />\nthought that he could receive a<br />\ngood education and play<br />\nbasketball too. Brian tells of his<br />\nfriends who went to basketball<br />\nschools on full scholarships and<br />\nbecame nothing more than<br />\nathletic commodities. The other<br />\nguard on his high school team<br />\neven dropped out of school after<br />\ntwo years because he could no<br />\nlonger stand being treated as a<br />\nscoring machine.<br />\nThis, of course, if fine as far as<br />\nit goes. Yet Brian recognizes that<br />\nsuch an attitutde is harmful once<br />\nthe athlete enters college. Arriving<br />\nat Hopkins, he discovers a student<br />\nbody that is largely indifferent to<br />\nthe sport-or any sport. In some<br />\ncases they even look upon.<br />\nbasketball players with contempt.<br />\nThe athletes cannot help but<br />\n<br />\nrespond negatively themselves.<br />\nBrian feels that, looking back, he<br />\nhad regarded basketball as a tool<br />\nwith which to enter college. At<br />\nthat time he did not really value<br />\nits positive potential.<br />\nIn a way, his comments are<br />\nindicative of much that is wrong<br />\nat Hopkins. Basically, Hopkins<br />\nathletes are a group of intelligent<br />\npeople who were turned off by<br />\nthe pressure and impersonalness<br />\nfactories<br />\nof the larger at<br />\nthey could have attended. But, as<br />\nBerke pointed out, they are also<br />\nhuman and fell hurt, ignored or<br />\neven slighted by the student body<br />\nand arc angered by this. They<br />\nthink back to the schools they<br />\ncould have attended and for one<br />\nslight moment they regret.<br />\nUniversity Policy<br />\nTheir problems are further<br />\ncomplicated by university policy.<br />\nOf course there is much to be<br />\ngained by keeping the sports<br />\natmosphere informal - allowing<br />\nthe not so talented athlete to be<br />\nable to participate. But one must<br />\nremember there also exists the<br />\nalmost-superior athlete like Brian<br />\nBerke who have become caught<br />\nup in the atmosphere of<br />\nindifference at Hopkins and look<br />\nback to what might have been.<br />\nBrian, however, does not fault<br />\nthe coaches. He feels that they are<br />\n<br />\nyoung and idealistic and that their<br />\ndevotion and sincerity make up<br />\nfor any of their faults.<br />\nIt would also be foolish to<br />\nexpect the sschool to change its<br />\npolicies and begin to emphasize<br />\ninter-collegiate athletics. In fact,<br />\nthe university would probabl<br />\nlose very much that makes- its s<br />\nprogram so valuable. But r think<br />\nthat it should be recognized that<br />\nathletes are human, that they are<br />\ninfluenced by their peers, and<br />\nthat it is difficult to spend hours<br />\nfor days, weeks and months in<br />\nactivities that are not recognized<br />\nby one's peers and that take<br />\nvaluable time away from one's<br />\nstudies. The intrinsic reward of<br />\nthe sport itself is a novel ideal<br />\nthat one can aim for, but it is<br />\nhardly a reality that most can<br />\nachieve.<br />\nBrian talks with pleasure of the<br />\nLebanon Valley game. The team<br />\nwas tired of being the butt of<br />\njokes and was out to prove<br />\nsomething to itself. Even Brian<br />\nadmits that he had not been<br />\nsatisfied with his play and felt<br />\nthat he owed it to his team and<br />\nthe coach to produce something<br />\nextra. Again all of this is fine as<br />\nfar as it goes. The-basketball team<br />\ndid win that night.

This<br />\nis particularly the . case due to<br />\nshortages of free money for the<br />\nnormal expansionary plans of a<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nHopkins, for example, has<br />\nfound it necessary to turn to<br />\ngovernment funding to help close<br />\nthe gap between desired spending<br />\nand available resources. Over 50%<br />\nof the University's operating<br />\nbudget for the 1967-68 academic<br />\nyear came from such<br />\ngovernmental sources.<br />\nThe financial strain placed on<br />\ncolleges, however, is especially<br />\nfelt by the state college or the<br />\nprivate yet liberal-arts oriented<br />\nschools. In many ways,<br />\ngovernmental funds are not as<br />\navailable to them as is the case<br />\nwith research or science oriented<br />\n.iniversities.<br />\nBudget Cuts<br />\nThe difficulties found at<br />\nFOWS011 State College are, in<br />\n;eneral, the problems felt by<br />\nnany small state or state-related<br />\n;olleges. Towson's President, Dr.<br />\n,arle T.

Colleges must, today, teach<br />\na widening selection of academic<br />\nfields and maintain their position<br />\nin fields which, themselves, are<br />\nrapidly broadening.

According the U.S.<br />\ncommerce reports, Boorstein<br />\npointed out, 22 American<br />\ncompanies owned 75% of the best<br />\nland in Cuba. The companies were<br />\ninterested in selling in the<br />\nAmerican market, not in<br />\nproviding foodstuffs for the<br />\nCuban people. So large amounts<br />\nof land remained idle and the rest<br />\nwas used for the highly unstable,<br />\nc om m o di t y--sugar. Meanwhile,<br />\n\"the bulk of the Cuban people<br />\nwere impoverished, landless, rural<br />\nwage earners, unemployed<br />\n25-50% of the time.\"<br />\n\"This kind of economy,\"<br />\ndeclared Boorstein, \"did not<br />\nhappen by itself.\" At the close of<br />\nthe Spanish American War the<br />\nU.S. occupied Cuba. According to<br />\nBoorstein, only when the Cubans<br />\nagreed to the Platt Amendment<br />\nwhich gave the U.S. the right to<br />\nintervene militarily to protect life<br />\nand property did the occupation<br />\nend. The U.S. intervened<br />\nmilitarily in 1906, 1912 and<br />\n1917. \"How do you think Cubans<br />\nfelt,\" inquired Boorstein, \"when<br />\nmilitary troops came in?\"<br />\n\"If the majority of Americans<br />\nhad to live under that kind of<br />\nsystem (some of us do) we'd be<br />\nup in arms\".<br />\nAlso \"rammed down the<br />\nCubans' throats\" was a reciprical<br />\ntrade agreement: This served,<br />\nargued Boorstein, to suffocate<br />\ninfant Cuban industry which<br />\ncould not compete with American<br />\ngoods on the free market.<br />\nAbraham Lincoln, Boorstein<br />\nnoted ironically, \"was a believer<br />\nin protection for infant industry<br />\nback when Britain was developed<br />\nand the U.S. was not. But when<br />\nwe became the more developed<br />\nnation we began to believe in<br />\nreciprocal trade agreements.\"<br />\nIn 1933, the Cuban people<br />\nrebelled against Antonio<br />\nManchette, a dictator known as<br />\nthe \"Butcher\". Sumner Wells,<br />\nexplained Boorstein \"was sent by<br />\nRoosevelt to defend American<br />\nbusiness interest.\" After a series<br />\nof palace revolts, encouraged by<br />\nWells to forestall revolution, San<br />\nMartin came to power. San Martin<br />\nwas under pressure to nationalize<br />\nAmerican businesses and the U.S.<br />\nre fused his government<br />\nrecognition. Wells manipulated<br />\nbehind the scenes; the marines<br />\nwere mobilized; warships went<br />\ninto Cuban waters. Batista was<br />\ninstalled into power and was<br />\nimmediately recognized by the<br />\nU.S.<br />\n\"This was not done under a<br />\nreactionary president,\" Boorstein<br />\npointed out. \"Rather it was done<br />\nunder a liberal, Franklin<br />\nRoosevelt.\" Likewise, Boorstein<br />\nemphasized that the heads of the<br />\ncorporations which created the<br />\ninhuman conditions in Cuba<br /><br />\nTHE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY 1<br />\nON CAMPUS<br />\nUM<br /><br />\nThis Sunday - 10:30 A.M.<br /><br />\nAnother \"Multi-Media\" Mass<br />\nFilm: \"That's Me\" with Alan Arkin<br /><br />\nSHAFFER HALL Rm.3<br /><br />\n\"were proper people acting<br />\nwithout malice.

ORNSTEIN<br />\nLast week the Academic<br />\nCouncil once again demonstrated<br />\nthat Hopkins is no academic<br />\ncommunity. This supreme<br />\nacademic body of the University<br />\nemasculated a request for student<br />\nrepresentation and unanimously<br />\nvoted to set up a token<br />\n\"Committee on Student<br />\nRelations\". This committee will<br />\nserve only to duplicate presently<br />\nexisting channels of<br />\ncommunication between students<br />\nand the Council.<br />\nWith the support of status<br />\nquo-oriented undergraduate<br />\nrepresentatives, conservative<br />\nmembers of the Council turned<br />\ndown a proposal made by the<br />\nGraduate Club to seat two<br />\ngraduate students and two<br />\nundergraduates. It went so far as<br />\nto deny the request of one of its<br />\nstanding committees, the<br />\nGraduate Board, to include<br />\nstudents in its deliberations. This,<br />\nin spite of the fact that the<br />\nGraduate Board had itself<br />\nunanimously requested this<br />\nrepresentation. The Council also<br />\nreduced, from four to two, the<br />\nnumber of students sitting on the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies.<br />\nIn order to \"establish a<br />\ncontinuing point of contact\" with<br />\nstudents the Council set up the<br />\nCommittee on Students<br />\nRelations. And this fits in very<br />\nnicely with the liberal rhetoric<br />\nabout the need for \"openness\"<br />\nand \"communication\" and<br />\n\"understanding\" within our<br />\ninstitutions. But that isn't what<br />\nthe Graduate Club was requesting.<br />\nWhat it asked for was a real role<br /><br />\nfor students in the<br />\ndecision-making in the University,<br />\nnot only consultation \"contact\",<br />\nbut also a real voice and some<br />\nmeasure of power.<br />\n\"Powerless\" Students<br />\nLet us have a look at the way<br />\nin which the Academic Council<br />\nhas chosen to view Hopkins. It<br />\nsees a dichotomized University,<br />\nwith powerless students on the<br />\nother. Students are here to learn<br />\nand are thought of as transitory<br />\ncustomers. They have no real<br />\ninterest in the University and no<br />\ncompetence to judge what is good<br />\nfor Hopkins as a whole, or for<br />\nthemselves in particular. Graduate<br />\nstudents, who play a vital and<br />\nindispensable role in research, are<br />\ndenied representation on a<br />\ncommittee concerned solely with<br />\ntheir own affairs.<br />\nWhat are the arguments against<br />\nstudent membership? First there<br />\nis the \"all this doesn't mean<br />\nanything to students anyway\"<br />\nargument. But look at some of<br />\nthe things the Council<br />\nconsiders--like degree<br />\nrequirements and who gets<br />\npromoted and our stand on the<br />\nnew federal law cutting off aid to<br />\nstudents who obstruct the<br />\nUniversity. These are certainly<br />\nrelevant matters. Students are<br />\ncertainly not incompetent to deal<br />\nwith them.<br />\nAnd perhaps students on the<br />\nAcademic Council could do<br />\nconstructive things too, like doing<br />\nsomething to raise the abysmal<br />\nwages paid the University's<br />\nemployees or try to get more<br />\nblack students admitted. Maybe<br />\nsomething could be done to<br />\nimprove the horrible teaching<br /><br />\nitandards at Hopkins.<br />\nThen why are the members of<br />\nthe Academic Council so afraid of<br />\njust a few students? Other<br />\nUniversitites have such<br />\nrepresentation, and they have not<br />\ncollapsed into chaos. At least one<br />\nCouncil member has made the<br />\nargument that student<br />\nrepresentation would destroy the<br />\nconfidentiality of its meetings,<br />\nand with it the atmosphere of a<br />\ncouncil of peers.<br />\nNot Corporation<br />\nBut what is the meaning of this<br />\n\"confidentiality\"? In its motion<br />\npresented to the Council, the<br />\nGraduate Club also called for<br />\nopen meetings. What members of<br />\nthe Council must realize is that a<br />\nuniversity is not so simply a<br />\ncorporation turning out research<br />\nas efficiently as possible. Secrecy<br />\ncan only serve to make us less a<br />\ncommunity. What we must strive<br />\nfor is a university where each<br />\nmember, be he student, faculty,<br />\nadministrator or employee, takes<br />\na part in the decision-making<br />\nprocess.<br />\nThe Academic Council sets the<br />\ntone for the whole University. If<br />\nwe decry an undergraduate<br />\nrepresentative's acting as the<br />\n\"moderate\" spokesman of<br />\nreaction, if speak of the isolation<br />\nof many Hopkins students, we<br />\nhave only to look to this supreme<br />\ngoverning body to see who sets<br />\nthe style.<br />\nSooner or later there will be<br />\nstudent representation on the<br />\nAcademic Council,just as it exists<br />\nat many other universities. Why<br />\nnot now? It would make Hopkins<br />\na better place.<br /><br />\nIGlee Club \"Fairy\" Talel<br />\nBy TIM STOCKS<br />\nThere is a charming story<br />\nrelating the supposed strangement<br />\nand reconciliation of King George<br />\n1 and George Frederic Handel. It<br />\nseems that Handel was the court<br />\ncomposer for the Elector of<br />\nHanover. One day Fred., as he<br />\nwas known to his intimates,,<br />\napproached the Elector and said,<br />\n\"Sire, I wonder if I might take a<br />\nfew months off and visit<br />\nEngland.\"<br />\nThe Elector said that a few<br />\nmonths would be all right but<br />\ncautioned Handel to return to<br />\nbeautiful Hanover soon. Handel<br />\nwent to England and found things<br />\nso pleasant that he overstayed his<br />\nleave. One can well imagine his<br />\nirritation when his former<br />\nemployer ascended the English<br />\nthrone as King George I. In order<br />\nto regain his former employer's<br />\nfavor, Handel composed a musical<br />\npetition - Water Musick. The story<br />\ngoes on to say that the King was<br />\nso pleased by this composition<br />\nthat Handel was again the beloved<br />\nemployee.<br />\nUnfortunately this tale is<br />\nuntrue.<br />\nThere is another charming<br />\nstory going around. It seems that<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nGlee Club, The Johns Hopkins<br />\nSchool of Nursing Chorus, five<br />\nsoloists and one organist under<br />\nthe baton of Ellery B. Woodworth<br />\ngave one of the best performances<br />\nof Handel's Messiah witnessed by<br />\nman.<br />\nJust as the other Handel story<br />\nisn't true, this story isn't true.<br />\nOne could never make a<br />\ncomprehensive listing of all the<br />\nflaws cround into this production<br /><br />\nof Ha-riders oratorio.' A partial<br />\nreport will have to do. The alto<br />\nchoked up on \"Behold a virgin<br />\nshall conceive.\" Admittedly this is<br />\nsomewhat improbable, but she<br />\ndid have time to accustom herself<br />\nto the notion. The soprano was<br />\nplagued by imprecision in \"There<br />\nwere shepherds abiding in the<br />\nfields\" and subsequent sections.<br />\nThe second soprano's lack of<br />\nbreath control was painfully<br />\napparent in \"Rejoice greatly, a<br />\ndaughter of Zion.\" The tenor,<br />\nwhile not bothered by technical<br />\nerrors, showed that stoicism can<br />\nruin an otherwise perfect<br />\nrendition. A good example of this<br />\nlack of emotion was found in the<br />\naria, \"Though shalt break them<br />\nwith a rod or iron, Thou shalt<br />\ndash them like a potter's vessel.\"<br />\nUnfortunately, his voice got<br />\nacross the concept of dashing and<br />\nbreaking about as well as George<br />\nWallace's voice got across the<br />\nfeeling of Christian concern for<br />\nhis fellow man. With regard to the<br />\nbass, one cannot find as much<br />\nfault. While it is true that on<br />\noccasion he wavered it was, all in<br />\nall, a competent bit of work.<br />\nUndoubtedly, the weakest was<br />\nthe chorus. Their total<br />\nperformance could be heard in<br />\nmicrocosm during the famed<br />\nHallelujah Chorus. There is a<br />\ntradition of standing up during<br />\nthe chorus which dates to one of<br />\nthe earlier productions of Messiah<br />\nunder Handers supervision. The<br />\nKing of England (that stalwart of<br />\nHandel stories) attended the<br />\nperformance, sitting quietly<br />\nthroughout. For no apparent<br />\nreason (maybe he wanted to<br />\nstretlic his legs) when the first<br /><br />\n\"Hallelujah!\" rang out, he stood<br />\nup. Since no loyal subject of the<br />\nKing may remain seated while his<br />\nmonarch stands, the whole<br />\naudience stood up. Somehow this<br />\npointless custom has survived and<br />\naudiences everywhere will<br />\nlemming-like leap to their<br />\ncollective feet at the first notes of<br />\nthe Hallelujah Chorus. Evidently<br />\nEllery B. Woodworth had no faith<br />\nin our lemming instincts as he<br />\ninformed us beforehand of the<br />\nnecessity of standing.<br />\nThe chorus spattered out the<br />\nfirst \"Hallelujah!\" and I found<br />\nmyself torn between two<br />\nconflicting reactions. One was<br />\nthat of hilarity and the other was<br />\nto commit Hopkins' first mass<br />\nmurder. However, I suppressed<br />\nmy desires and discovered that<br />\nwhen I ignored the myriads of<br />\nmissed notes, the ragged entrances<br />\nand the over-all lack of precision,<br />\nwe could say in truth that their<br />\nvoices were lousy.<br />\nSurprise<br />\nAs I walked in back of the<br />\npower plant towards Charles<br />\nStreet I saw a corpulent man<br />\ndressed in a style outdated for<br />\nover two hundred years pacing<br />\nabout, approximately seven feet<br />\nabove the ground. Back and forth<br />\nhe paced, muttering imprecations<br />\nand flailing the air with his arms. I<br />\ncrept up silently, fearing for my<br />\nexistence, yet irrepressibly drawn<br />\ntowards him. When I was<br />\napproximately five feet from him<br />\nhe stopped his aerial ambulations<br />\nand held me in his ghastly gaze.<br />\nBefore dematerializing he sighed<br />\nand muttered, \"I never should<br />\nhave left beautiful Hanover.\"<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\n-^<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, DEC. 13,1968<br /><br />\nCorrespondence<br />\nMISUNDERSTANDING<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nFor the benefit of my anxious<br />\nfriends and relatives who have not<br />\nyet succeeded in getting in touch<br />\nwith me, I would appreciate it if<br />\nyou would publish this letter<br />\nstating that I am not the<br />\nimperialist Gordon\" who was<br />\nexecuted last week.

They're like those<br />\nold greayheaded house niggers<br />\nyou can still find in the South<br />\nwho don't see what all the fuss is<br />\nabout because Mr. Charlie \"treats<br />\nus real good.\"<br />\nCollege entrance requirements<br />\ntend to favor the Toms and screen<br />\nout the rebels. Not entirely, of<br />\ncourse. Some students at Cal<br />\nState L.A. are expert con artists<br />\nwho know perfectly well what's<br />\nhappening. They want the degree<br />\nor the 2-S and spend their years<br />\non the old plantation alternately<br />\nlaughing and cursing as they play<br />\nthe game. If their egos are strong<br />\nenough, they cheat a lot. And, of<br />\ncourse, even the Toms are angry<br />\ndown deep somewhere. But it<br />\ncomes out in passive rather than<br />\nactive aggression. They're<br />\nunexplainably thick-witted and<br />\nsubject to frequent spells of<br />\nlaziness. They misread simple<br />\nquestions. They spend their nights<br />\nmechan ically outlining history<br />\nchapters while meticulously<br />\nfailing to comprehend a word of<br />\nwhat's in front of them.<br />\nInward Anger<br />\nThe saddest cases among both<br />\nblack slaves and student slaves are<br />\nthe ones who have so thoroughly<br />\nintrojected their masters' values<br />\nthat their anger is all turned<br />\ninward. At Cal State these are the<br />\nkids for whom every low grade is<br />\ntorture, who stammer and shake<br />\nwhen they speak to 'a professor,<br />\nwho go through an emotional<br />\ncrisis every time they're called<br />\nupon during class. You can<br />\nrecognize them easily at finals<br />\ntime. Thei faces are festooned<br />\nwith fresh pimples; their bowels<br />\nboil audibly across the room. If<br />\nthere really is a Last Judgement.<br />\nthen the parents and teachers who<br />\ncreated these wrecks are going to<br />\nburn in hell.<br />\nSo students are niggers. . It's<br />\ntime to find out why, and to do<br />\nthis, we have to take a long look<br />\nat Mr. Charlie.<br />\nThe teachers I know best are<br />\ncollege professors. Outsides the<br />\nclassroom and taken as a group.<br />\ntheir most striking characteristic<br />\nis timidity.<br />\nJ ust lOok at their Working<br />\nconditions. At a. 011ie when even<br />\nmigrant workers have begun to<br />\ntight and win, college - professors<br />\nare still afraid to make more than<br />\na token effort to improve their<br />\npitiful economic status. In<br />\nCalifornia state colleges the<br />\nfaculties are screwed regularly and<br />\nvigorously by the Governor and<br />\nLegislature and yet they \u2022 still<br />\nwon't offer any solid resistance.<br />\nThey lie flat on their stomachs<br />\nwith their pants down, mumbling<br />\ncatch phrases like \"professional<br />\ndignity\" and \"meaningful<br />\ndialogue.\"<br />\nNo Different<br />\nProfessors were no different<br />\nwhen I was an undergraduate at<br />\nUCLA during the McCarthy era; it<br />\nwas like a cattle stampede as they<br />\nrushed to cop out. And. ip more<br />\nrecent .'ears. I found that my<br />\nbeing arrested in sit-ins brought<br />\nfrom my colleagues not so much<br />\napproval or condemnation as<br />\nopen-mouthed astonishment.<br />\n\"You could lose your job!\"<br /><br />\nNow, of course, there's the<br />\nVietnamese war. It gets some<br />\nopposition from a few teachers.<br />\nSome support it. But a vast<br />\nnumber of professors, who know<br />\nperfectly well what's happening<br />\nare copping out again. And in the<br />\nhigh schools, you can forget it<br />\nStillness reigns.<br />\nI'm not sure why teachers are<br />\nso chickenshit. It could be that<br />\nacademic training itself forces a<br />\nsplit between thought and action.<br />\nIt might also be that the tenured<br />\nsecurity of a teaching job attracts<br />\ntimid persons and, furthermore,<br />\nthat teaching, like police work,<br />\npulls in persons who are unsure of<br />\nthemselves and need weapons and<br />\nthe other. external trappings of.<br />\nauthority.<br />\nAs Judy Eisenstein has<br />\neloquently pointed out, the<br />\nclassroom offers an artificial and<br />\nprotected environment in which<br />\nteachers can exercise their will to<br />\npower. Your neighbors may drive<br />\na better car; gas station attendants<br />\nmay intimidate you; your wife<br />\nmay dominate you; the State<br />\nLegislature may shit on you; but<br />\nin the classroom, by God,<br />\nstudents do what you say - or<br />\nelse. The grade is a hell of a<br />\nweapon. It may not rest on your<br />\nhip, potent and rigid like a cop's<br />\ngun, but in the long run it's more<br />\npowerful. At your personal whim<br />\n- any time you choose - you can<br />\nkeep 35 students up for nights<br />\nand have the pleasure of seeing<br />\nthem walk into the classroom<br />\npasty-faced and. red-eyed carrying<br />\na sheaf of typewritten pages, with<br />\ntitle page, MLA footnotes and<br />\nmargins set at 15 and 91.<br />\nTimidity<br />\nThe 'general timidity which<br />\ncauses teachers, to make .niggers of<br />\ntheir students usually includes a<br />\nfear of the<br />\nmore - specific fear<br />\nstudents themselves. After all,<br />\nstudents are different, just like<br />\nblack people. You stand exposed<br />\nin front of them, knowing that<br />\ntheir interests; their values and<br />\ntheir language are different from<br />\nyours. To make matters worse,<br />\nyou. may suspect that you<br />\nyourself are not the most<br />\nengaging of persons. What then<br />\ncan protect you from their<br />\nridicule and scorn? Respect for<br />\nAuthority. That's what. It's the<br />\npoliceman's gun again. The white<br />\nbwana's pith helmet. So you<br />\nflaunt that authority. You wither<br />\nwhisperers with a murderous<br />\nglance. You crush objectors with<br />\nerudition and heavy irony; And,<br />\nworst of all, you make your own<br />\nattainments seem not, accessible<br />\nbut awesomely remote. You<br />\nconceal your massive<br />\nignorance\u2014and parade a slender<br />\n.<br />\nlearning.<br />\n'White Supremacy'<br />\nThe teacher's fear is mixed<br />\nwith an understandable need to<br />\nbe admired and to feel superior, a<br />\nneed which also makes him cling<br />\nto his \"white supremacy.\"<br />\nIdeally, a teacher should minimize<br />\nthe distance between himself and<br />\nhis students. He should encourage<br />\nt hem not to need him -eventually or even immediately.<br />\nBut this is rarely the case.<br />\nTeachers Make themselves high<br />\npriests of arcane mysteries. They<br />\nbecome masters of<br />\ninumbo-jumbo. Even a more or<br />\nless conscientious teaclier may be<br />\ntorn between the desire to give<br />\nand the desire to hold them in<br />\nbondage to hint. I can find no<br />\nother explanation that accounts<br />\nfor the way my own subject.<br />\nliterature, is generally taught.<br /><br />\nLiterature, which ought to be a<br />\nsource of joy, solace and<br />\nenlightenment, often becomes in<br />\nthe classroom nothing more than<br />\na source of anxiety \u2014 at best an<br />\narena for expertise, a ledger book<br />\nfor the ego. Literature teachers<br />\noften afraid to join a real union<br />\nnonetheless may practice the<br />\nworst kind of trade-unionism in<br />\nthe classroom? they do to<br />\nliterature what Beckmesser does<br />\nto song in Wagner's<br />\n\"Meistersinger.\" The avowed<br />\npurpose of English departments is<br />\nto teach literature; too often their<br />\nreal function is to kill it.<br />\nDark Reason<br />\nFinally, there's the darkest<br />\nreason of all for the master-slave<br />\napproach to education. The less<br />\ntrained and the less socialized a<br />\nperson is, the more he constitutes<br />\na sexual threat and the more he<br />\nwill be subjugated by institutions,<br />\nsuch as penitentiaries and schools.<br />\nMany of us are aware of now of<br />\nthe sexual neurosis which makes<br />\nwhite man so fearful of integrated<br />\nschools and neighborhoods, and<br />\nwhich makes the castration of<br />\nNe'groes a deeply entrenched<br />\nSouthern folkway. We should<br />\nrecognize a similar pattern in<br />\neducation. There is a kind of<br />\ncastration that goes on in schools.<br />\nIt begins before school years, with<br />\nparents' first encroachments on<br />\ntheir children's free unashamed<br />\nsexuality and continues right up<br />\nto the day when they hand you<br />\nyour doctoral diploma with a<br />\nbleeding, shriveled pair of testicles<br />\nstapled to the parchment. It's not<br />\nthat sexuality has no place in the<br />\nclassroom. You'll find it there but<br />\nonly in certain perverted and<br />\nvitiated forms.<br />\nBleeding Brains<br />\nHow does sex show up in<br />\nschool? First of all, there's the<br />\nsado-masochistic relationship<br />\nbetween teachers and students.<br />\nThat's plenty sexual, although the<br />\nprice of enjoying it is to be<br />\nunaware of what's happening. In<br />\nwalks the student in his Ivy<br />\nLeague equivalent of a motor<br />\ncycle jacket. In walks the teacher<br />\n- a kind of intellectual rough trade<br />\n- and flogs his students with no<br />\ngrades, tests, sarcasm and snotty<br />\nsuperiority until their very brains<br />\nare bleeding. In Swinburne's<br />\nEngland, the whipped school boy<br />\nfrequently gres up to be a<br />\nflagellant. With us the perversion<br />\nis intellectual but It's no less<br />\nperverse.<br />\nSex also shows up in the<br />\nclassroom as academic subject<br />\nmatter - sanitized and abstracted,<br />\nthroughly divorced from feeling.<br />\nYou get \"sex education\" now in<br />\nboth high school and college<br />\nclasses: everyone determined not<br />\nto be embarrassed, to be very up<br />\nto date, very contempo. These are<br />\nthe classes for which sex, as<br />\nFeiffer puts it, \"can be a beautiful<br />\nthing if properly administered.\"<br />\nAnd then, of course, there's still<br />\nanother depressing manifestation<br />\nof sex \u2022 in the classroom: the<br />\n\"off-color\" teacher, who keeps<br />\nhis class awake with sniggering<br />\nsexual allusions, obscene titters<br />\nand academic inuendo. The<br />\nsexuality he purveys, it must be<br />\nadmitted, is at least better than<br />\nnone at all.<br />\nWhat's missing, from<br />\nkindergarten to graduate school,<br />\nis honest recognition of what's<br />\nactually heppening - turned-on<br />\nawareness of hairy goodies<br />\n(Continued to Page 13)<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, DEC. 13, 1968<br /><br />\nPAGE 11<br /><br />\nTutorial Course Added \"Sun\" Reporter SDS Emerges Victorious<br />\nTo Hopkins Curriculum Fails to Confirm In Dorm Confrontation<br />\nGordon Death<br /><br />\nAs part of the plans for an<br />\nexpanded tutorial program at<br />\nJHU, a tutorial course entitled<br />\n\"the disadvantaged child in the<br />\nurban setting--a tutorial<br />\napproach,\" is being instituted at<br />\nHomewood during the second<br />\nsemester.<br />\nThe course, number (S)23.32,<br />\nwill be taught by Dr. Wickwire,<br />\nMrs. Lynn Kagen, a director of<br />\nthe tutorial programs here, and a<br />\nseries of guest lecturers.<br />\nAccording to a recent circular, the<br />\ncourse \"will deal with ghetto<br />\nculture, the role of the tutor and<br />\nthe effects of poverty and racism<br />\non learning.\" Problems of<br />\ninstitutional racism, the<br />\ninfluences of dialectical<br />\ndifferences in phonics, and<br />\nEnglish as a second language,<br />\namong other things, will be<br />\ndiscussed.<br />\nIn addition to a Thursday<br />\nafternoon lecture where reading<br />\nmaterial will include works by<br />\nsuch personalities as Malcolm X<br />\nand Stokely Carmichael, the<br />\ncourse will also include field work<br />\nwhere students will tutor children<br />\nprimarily in the ghetto areas of<br />\nBaltimore's inner city.

It is now felt that tutors<br />\ncan manage to overcome any<br />\nempathy barriers themselves, with<br />\ntheir current success in this area<br />\nconstantly cited as proof of this.<br />\nTutoring at present is divided<br />\ninto two programs, the Hopkins<br />\nProgram and the Saturday<br />\nMorning High School Program<br />\nheld here. The former involves<br />\nninety Hopkins undergraduate<br />\nstudents as well as ten graduate<br />\nstudents who go to a tutee's home<br />\nand aid the student on a one to<br />\none basis. The latter program<br />\nbrings 275 high school students to<br />\nthe Homewood campus on<br />\nSaturday mornings to be tutored<br />\non the same basis as the Hopkins<br />\none to one program.<br />\nThere are now 300 tutees on<br />\nthe waiting list as well, as an<br />\nincreasing amount of Hopkins<br />\nstudents who have expressed a<br />\ndesire to be tutors who would<br />\nmore than make up for the very<br />\nsmall attrition rate of the<br />\nprogram.

The tutor may consult<br />\nthe tutee's teacher. The tutors are<br />\nalso encouraged to work with the<br />\nstudent's parents to establish<br />\nmore contact.

We knew that<br />\npolice brutality was a technique<br />\nof exploitation\u2014to keep the<br />\ncommunity in its place. So we<br />\nfought this which was to the<br />\nPower structure of Baltimore a<br />\nvery unwelcomed fight. In 1942<br />\nthe NAACP formed a citywide<br />\ncommittee, The Citizens for<br />\nJustice, and we had a march of<br />\n2,000 citizens on Annapolis. We<br />\nhad had six killings by police in<br />\n18 months climaxed by the<br />\nshooting of a black soldier in the<br />\nback by, it was said, a drunken<br />\npoliceman...We channeled these<br />\ntensions on the march on<br />\nAnnapolis because we could get<br />\nno redress from the police<br />\ncommissioner, the grand jury<br />\nindicted the policeman only to<br />\nreverse the decision a few days<br />\nlater, and we wired the governor,<br />\nbut he did not answer us. As a<br />\nresult of the march and a meeting<br />\nWith the governor at that time, he<br />\n(the governor) appointed the first<br />\ninter-racial commission which<br />\nlater was sanctioned by the<br />\nlegislature. The commission<br />\ninvestigated the shooting incident<br />\nand later tackled other black<br />\nproblems... A report issued by the<br />\ncommission recommended that<br />\naction be taken by the grand jury<br />\nagainst the police offer, and, more<br />\nimportant, it said the police<br />\ncommissioner should conduct<br />\ndepartment hearings on<br />\ndisciplining his own men... This<br />\nstarted a whole new nationwide<br />\nPattern of police review of their<br />\nactions...<br />\nFirst In South<br />\nFrom the petitions we made<br />\nafter the 1 954 desegregation<br />\ndecision by the Supreme Court,<br />\nBaltimore was the first city south<br />\nof the Mason-Dixon Line to<br />\nintegrate their public.

Nixon won on the<br />\nbacklash vote. The NAACP is not<br />\nfooled. We are headed for the<br />\nmainstream of American<br />\neconomic life. And we won't be<br />\nsidetracked by running a few<br />\nblack gas stations or shoe shining<br />\ncorners. We want to see blacks<br />\nand whites together running the<br />\nindustries...<br />\nN-L - Some radical groups,such as<br />\nthe Black Panthers and CORE<br />\nclaim that the white<br />\ncommunity will not grant de<br />\nfacto freedom to blacks.

These<br />\nyoung radicals laugh at the<br />\nlaws, but as a result of our<br />\ncrusade for 1965 Voting<br />\nRights Act and the 1957 Act,<br />\nwhich was before the March on<br />\nWashington, before the sit-ins<br />\nand the like, we have gotten<br />\nhundreds of thousands of<br />\nNegroes registered in the<br />\nSouth, and. have elected<br />\njustices of the peace, county<br />\nclerks, and other openings.<br />\nN-L - Concerning Hopkins, the<br />\nBlack Student Union wants, as<br />\npart of its charter, tO exclude<br />\nall whites.

The NAACP has<br />\nfought against segregation<br />\nagainst Negroes in fraternity<br /><br />\nhouses.

Notes<br />\nBy GEORGE KIRSCHBAUM<br />\nThe BIA recently released the<br />\ntrophy point totals for the Fall<br />\nSeason. The BIA has adopted a<br />\nnew simplified scoring system for<br />\nthe major sports. The adoption of<br />\nthe new system reduces much of<br />\nthe confusion inherent in the old<br />\nsystem. Phi Gam, the 1966-67<br />\nf....lernity champs, lead this year's<br />\ncontenders, but they are being<br />\nclosely pursued by six other<br />\nfraternities, all within twenty-five<br />\npoints of Phi Gam's 117. Adams<br />\nHouse which last won the<br />\nfreshman trophy in 1965-66 look<br />\nlike the favorites this year. In the<br />\nupperclass dorms, Wood House<br />\nhas a slim lead over Willard<br />\nHouse.<br />\nGam Leads Fraternities<br />\nPhi Gamma Delta combined<br />\nfirst place in the Goucher Gallop<br />\nwith a second place in tennis and<br />\na .500 record in football to nail<br />\ndown first place in the trophy<br />\npoint standings. TEP, this year's<br />\nfraternity football champs,<br />\nfollows closely with 115 points,<br /><br />\ncast. Fortunately for the record<br />\nbook, Lebanon Valley was worse,<br />\nboasting no outstanding players<br />\nand two regulars that didn't score<br />\nat all. And so by a stroke of luck,<br />\nthe locals escaped, 66-59.<br />\nNo so fortunately, Haverford<br />\nshowed up with a decent team.<br />\nNot good, but decent. While our<br />\nheroes were wallowing along, four<br />\nof the Fords' starting quintet hit<br />\nin double figures, and the score<br />\nwas reversed, 76-62. Again Berke<br />\nand Rebo played creditable<br />\noffensive games, picking up<br />\nthirty-five points between them,<br />\nbut were outshined by the<br />\nconspicuous absence of the other<br />\nthree Jay players.<br />\nAs a team, Hopkins hit for<br />\nonly about thirty percent from<br />\nthe floor and missed a third of<br />\ntheir free throws. Despite this,<br />\nthey might still have won with<br />\nsome crisp ball-handling and some<br />\nhustle under the boards. As it<br />\nturned out, the Fords were no<br />\nshooting giants either, but<br />\ngenerally more polished play gave<br />\nthem twelve more scoring<br />\nopportunities from the floor and<br />\nHopkins five fewer chances from<br />\nthe foul line.<br />\nSwathmore Next<br />\nComing up next is an<br />\nencounter with Swathmore<br />\nSaturday.

One of the reasons for<br />\nthis stellar victory was the play of<br />\nsenior co-captain, Brian Berke.<br />\nBrian personifies the Hopkins<br />\n. athlete. In high school he was not<br />\nthe most sought after prospect on<br />\nhis team, but he did have offers<br />\nfrom several big schools.<br />\nHowever, Brian, like so many<br />\nothers, choses Hopkins as he<br />\nthought that he could receive a<br />\ngood education and play<br />\nbasketball too. Brian tells of his<br />\nfriends who went to basketball<br />\nschools on full scholarships and<br />\nbecame nothing more than<br />\nathletic commodities. The other<br />\nguard on his high school team<br />\neven dropped out of school after<br />\ntwo years because he could no<br />\nlonger stand being treated as a<br />\nscoring machine.<br />\nThis, of course, if fine as far as<br />\nit goes. Yet Brian recognizes that<br />\nsuch an attitutde is harmful once<br />\nthe athlete enters college. Arriving<br />\nat Hopkins, he discovers a student<br />\nbody that is largely indifferent to<br />\nthe sport-or any sport. In some<br />\ncases they even look upon.<br />\nbasketball players with contempt.<br />\nThe athletes cannot help but<br /><br />\nrespond negatively themselves.<br />\nBrian feels that, looking back, he<br />\nhad regarded basketball as a tool<br />\nwith which to enter college. At<br />\nthat time he did not really value<br />\nits positive potential.<br />\nIn a way, his comments are<br />\nindicative of much that is wrong<br />\nat Hopkins. Basically, Hopkins<br />\nathletes are a group of intelligent<br />\npeople who were turned off by<br />\nthe pressure and impersonalness<br />\nfactories<br />\nof the larger at<br />\nthey could have attended. But, as<br />\nBerke pointed out, they are also<br />\nhuman and fell hurt, ignored or<br />\neven slighted by the student body<br />\nand arc angered by this. They<br />\nthink back to the schools they<br />\ncould have attended and for one<br />\nslight moment they regret.<br />\nUniversity Policy<br />\nTheir problems are further<br />\ncomplicated by university policy.<br />\nOf course there is much to be<br />\ngained by keeping the sports<br />\natmosphere informal - allowing<br />\nthe not so talented athlete to be<br />\nable to participate. But one must<br />\nremember there also exists the<br />\nalmost-superior athlete like Brian<br />\nBerke who have become caught<br />\nup in the atmosphere of<br />\nindifference at Hopkins and look<br />\nback to what might have been.<br />\nBrian, however, does not fault<br />\nthe coaches. He feels that they are<br /><br />\nyoung and idealistic and that their<br />\ndevotion and sincerity make up<br />\nfor any of their faults.<br />\nIt would also be foolish to<br />\nexpect the sschool to change its<br />\npolicies and begin to emphasize<br />\ninter-collegiate athletics. In fact,<br />\nthe university would probabl<br />\nlose very much that makes- its s<br />\nprogram so valuable. But r think<br />\nthat it should be recognized that<br />\nathletes are human, that they are<br />\ninfluenced by their peers, and<br />\nthat it is difficult to spend hours<br />\nfor days, weeks and months in<br />\nactivities that are not recognized<br />\nby one's peers and that take<br />\nvaluable time away from one's<br />\nstudies. The intrinsic reward of<br />\nthe sport itself is a novel ideal<br />\nthat one can aim for, but it is<br />\nhardly a reality that most can<br />\nachieve.<br />\nBrian talks with pleasure of the<br />\nLebanon Valley game. The team<br />\nwas tired of being the butt of<br />\njokes and was out to prove<br />\nsomething to itself. Even Brian<br />\nadmits that he had not been<br />\nsatisfied with his play and felt<br />\nthat he owed it to his team and<br />\nthe coach to produce something<br />\nextra. Again all of this is fine as<br />\nfar as it goes. The-basketball team<br />\ndid win that night. But at<br />\nHopkins this is often the<br />\nexception and certainly not the<br />\nrule.<br /><br />\nExtremely Strong Frosh Five<br />\nLed by Apple and Handleman<br />\nBy MIKE SHORE<br />\nCoach Dick Barrette's<br />\nfreshman basketball team<br />\nappeared ready to begin their<br />\nregular season play last Tuesday<br />\nas they beat Catonsville<br />\n'Community College in a<br />\nscrimmage, by the score of 90 74.<br />\nThe squad began its regular<br />\nseason activities Thursday with a<br />\ngame against Gilman Prep.

Dr. Hawkins stated<br />\nhat: .<br />\n. .<br />\n\"If our budget is cut then<br />\nlenity salary scales won't be<br />\n/hat they should be.
