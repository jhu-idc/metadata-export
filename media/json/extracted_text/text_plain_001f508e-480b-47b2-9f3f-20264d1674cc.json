Without intruding upon the regular curricula, it encourages a sense of<br />\ncitizenship and, through an exchange of<br />\ncorrespondence with schools of the insular possessions and foreign nations, a<br />\nbroader interest in knowledge. The introduction to Red Cross work thus received in the secondary schools is carried into the colleges, where the annual<br />\nRoll Cali offers an opportunity for becoming acquainted with the program of<br />\nthe society.<br />\nAs readers of news events, college students know that the Red Cross has been<br />\nactive everywhere in the past year in promoting its general peace-time activities<br />\nand especially in relief work. It now<br />\nmay be worth while to speak of the part<br />\ntaken by Red Cross in alleviating misery<br />\ndue to disasters and to economic causes.<br />\nIn those communities which face unemployment problems, the local Red Cross<br />\nChapter is either the center of relief or<br />\nis a leading ag'ency in the relief organization.<br />\nBy Act of Congress, the Red Cross has<br />\ncharge of the distribution of a total of<br />\neighty-five million bushels of government<br />\nwheat to the needy, handling its conversion into flour and its shipping and distribution. Again by Federal law, it has<br />\nadded cotton to the milling business to<br />\nsatisfy clothing needs of the people in<br />\nwant.<br />\nDuring the year the Red Cross responded to the call of 62 disasters. Chief<br />\namong these was the $2,266,000 relief<br />\nprogram in .six of the Northwestern<br />\nstates, giving aid to 266,000 sufferers. The<br />\nRed Cross also handled the relief and<br />\nrehabilitation of 2,906 families suffering<br />\nfrom the March tornadoes in Alabama,<br />\nGeorgia, Tennessee and Kentucky. Altogether, the Red Cross expended $3,597,000 in administering to the needs of<br />\n77,500 families who suffered from natural calamities.<br />\nIn the relief of the unemployed, particularly in the mining areas and industrial<br />\ncommunities, the Red Cross gave free<br />\nseed for vegetable gardens to 300,000<br />\nfamilies.<br />\nIn considering this relief work, one<br />\nshould not lose sight of the steady service<br />\ngiven by the Red Cross in other lines.<br />\nAmong these services is the teaching of<br />\nfirst aid and life-saving, which has been<br />\ngiven at many colleges over the country<br />\nas a supplement to athletic work.<br />\nLet it be remembered that the Red<br />\nCross annual Roll Call opens on Armis-<br />\n<br />\nt\u2022<br />\n<br />\nwhat<br />\nDesert air is wet<br />\n. . . by comparison!<br />\n<br />\nTHE tobacco that is<br />\ncut best for pipes might<br />\nbe termed \"whittle cut\" or<br />\neerough cut,\" like Granger.<br />\nIt requires a type oftobacco<br />\ndifferent from the tobacco<br />\nused for chewing tobacco<br />\nor cigarettes.

No!<br />\nWe do not retract our view that Hoover has proved himself a rather weak<br />\nPresident; one who has, in the era of<br />\ndepression into which the nation was<br />\nthrown following the election of the Republican administration, deliberately misrepresented to the people of the United<br />\nStates the actual gravity of the economic<br />\ncondition of the country; and, while<br />\ncrying that his heart has bled for the<br />\ncommon people, one who has done everything for the big business men and nothing for the suffering small business men.<br />\nThe nation, if cannot be denied, needs<br />\na new vision in the White House and a<br />\nman who will be able to do much toward<br />\nlifting the nation from its present state.<br />\nThe Democrats, most certainly, can do<br />\nmuch toward achieving just that end.<br /><br />\nSuggesting Amendment<br />\n(Continued from Page 1, Col. 5)<br />\nshould three-fourths of the members of<br />\nthe class be made to vote in order to<br />\nhave a valid election the possibility of the<br />\npower-seeking fraternity men conducting a successful political campaign among<br />\napproximately 150 to 300, or more, students is slim.

Without intruding upon the regular curricula, it encourages a sense of<br />\ncitizenship and, through an exchange of<br />\ncorrespondence with schools of the insular possessions and foreign nations, a<br />\nbroader interest in knowledge. The introduction to Red Cross work thus received in the secondary schools is carried into the colleges, where the annual<br />\nRoll Cali offers an opportunity for becoming acquainted with the program of<br />\nthe society.<br />\nAs readers of news events, college students know that the Red Cross has been<br />\nactive everywhere in the past year in promoting its general peace-time activities<br />\nand especially in relief work. It now<br />\nmay be worth while to speak of the part<br />\ntaken by Red Cross in alleviating misery<br />\ndue to disasters and to economic causes.<br />\nIn those communities which face unemployment problems, the local Red Cross<br />\nChapter is either the center of relief or<br />\nis a leading ag'ency in the relief organization.<br />\nBy Act of Congress, the Red Cross has<br />\ncharge of the distribution of a total of<br />\neighty-five million bushels of government<br />\nwheat to the needy, handling its conversion into flour and its shipping and distribution. Again by Federal law, it has<br />\nadded cotton to the milling business to<br />\nsatisfy clothing needs of the people in<br />\nwant.<br />\nDuring the year the Red Cross responded to the call of 62 disasters. Chief<br />\namong these was the $2,266,000 relief<br />\nprogram in .six of the Northwestern<br />\nstates, giving aid to 266,000 sufferers. The<br />\nRed Cross also handled the relief and<br />\nrehabilitation of 2,906 families suffering<br />\nfrom the March tornadoes in Alabama,<br />\nGeorgia, Tennessee and Kentucky. Altogether, the Red Cross expended $3,597,000 in administering to the needs of<br />\n77,500 families who suffered from natural calamities.<br />\nIn the relief of the unemployed, particularly in the mining areas and industrial<br />\ncommunities, the Red Cross gave free<br />\nseed for vegetable gardens to 300,000<br />\nfamilies.<br />\nIn considering this relief work, one<br />\nshould not lose sight of the steady service<br />\ngiven by the Red Cross in other lines.<br />\nAmong these services is the teaching of<br />\nfirst aid and life-saving, which has been<br />\ngiven at many colleges over the country<br />\nas a supplement to athletic work.<br />\nLet it be remembered that the Red<br />\nCross annual Roll Call opens on Armis-<br /><br />\nt\u2022<br /><br />\nwhat<br />\nDesert air is wet<br />\n. . . by comparison!<br /><br />\nTHE tobacco that is<br />\ncut best for pipes might<br />\nbe termed \"whittle cut\" or<br />\neerough cut,\" like Granger.<br />\nIt requires a type oftobacco<br />\ndifferent from the tobacco<br />\nused for chewing tobacco<br />\nor cigarettes.
