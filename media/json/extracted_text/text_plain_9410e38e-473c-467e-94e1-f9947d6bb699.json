GOODGOLD<br />\nA seven week manufacturers<br />\ndelay in delivery of the special<br />\nPilkington glass foi the new<br />\nStudent Union's upper floors<br />\nmay delay completion of the<br />\nbuilding beyond the<br />\ncurrently-slated February 1<br />\ncompletion date.<br />\nThe glass was to have arrived<br />\non November 15th, but the<br />\narrival has been pc6tponed to<br />\nJanuary 6th. The glass, which<br />\nwill take at least four weeks to<br />\ninstall is to cover the upper<br />\nfloor's entire exterior wall.<br />\nPilkington glass, made only by<br />\nthe Pilkington Company of St.<br />\nHelen, Lancaster, England, is an<br />\nextremely strong material, able<br />\nto withstand the stress of<br />\nsupporting concrete. The<br />\nPilkington firm has a seven-week<br />\nbacklog of orders, which is<br />\nresponsible for the delay in<br />\ndelivery of the glass, said William<br />\nL. Campbell, Director of Plant<br />\nOperations and Maintenance.<br />\nBecause the glass will not be<br />\ndelivered until the winter, ideal<br />\nweather conditions may not<br />\npersist, according to Campbell.<br />\nExcellent weather is a<br />\nprecondition for the four week<br />\nlong installation of the glass and<br />\nthe weather must be consistently<br />\nthe<br />\ncomplete<br />\n\u2022 good to<br />\nsaid.<br />\nhe<br />\nprocess,<br />\nlong assembly<br />\nAccording to Campbell, if last<br />\nyear's warm weather returns this<br />\nyear, there will be no additional<br />\ndelay past the \"tentative\"<br />\nFebruary 1st completion date.<br />\n\"However,\" Campbell pointed<br />\nout, \"if we get a 15-inch<br />\nsnowstorm, a further delay<br />\nwould be probable.\"<br />\nCampbell also said a seven<br />\noccurred<br />\nweek delay has<br />\nwith delivery of the Student<br />\nUnion's electrical transformer,<br />\noriginally scheduled for<br />\nSeptember 30th. The<br />\npostponement has changed its<br />\narrival to November 11th.<br />\n<br />\nDean of Students Robert J.<br />\nFitzpatrick insisted that the<br />\nUnion would be used by<br />\nFebruary 1. \"I always forsee<br />\nproblems. (but) we'll use the<br />\ndamn facility anyway. if it isn't<br />\nready, we'll still use it,\" he<br />\nmaintained.<br />\nCampbell pointed out, that<br />\nthere is a penalty clause in the<br />\nschool's contract with J. Vinton<br />\nSchaefer, the construction firm<br />\nbuilding the Union, called a<br />\n'liquidating damages clause'. It<br />\nassesses a fine on the contractor.<br />\nfor each day after the<br />\ntermination date for completion<br />\nhas been set.<br />\nBecause the Union Building<br />\nhas been sponsored as an Housing<br />\nand Urban Development Projea,<br />\nthe liquidating clause is<br />\nmandatory with the HUD<br />\n<br />\nminimum fee set at $200 for<br />\neach additional day. Instead of<br />\nHopkins borrowing the money<br />\nfrom HUD, it has taken out a<br />\nloan from a commercial bank<br />\nyvith HUD paying the difference<br />\nof the interest (approximately at<br />\n8-9%). Campbell indicated that<br />\nthe firm would be fined the<br />\nminimum amount if work were<br />\nnot completed on schedule.<br />\nAs Campbell noted the most<br />\nimportant factor for completion<br />\n(aside from the delivery of the<br />\nmaterial) would be the weather.<br />\n\"We still have to pour (with<br />\nconcrete) the dining room floor<br />\non October 9th or 10th and pour<br />\nthe exterior wall on October<br />\n12th. Most importantly we still<br />\nhave to waterproof the roof of<br />\nthe building and it all depends<br />\nupon the weather,\" he<br />\n<br />\nDr. Hugh Kenner and Dr. Buckminster<br />\nestimated 140 to 200 people)<br />\ncommented.<br />\nand as of now three *pianos and<br />\nCampbell also stated that the<br />\nlower level of the Union would<br />\ntwo conference rooms.<br />\nbe completed February 1st.

Furthermore, each May,<br />\nthe house hosts the World<br />\nInvitational Pinball Tournament<br />\nand installs new members in the<br />\nPinball Hall of Fame. To mention<br />\nSavitz's name in the same breath as<br />\nHagan, Roan, Betta or any Hall of<br />\nFarrier reduces the sport to the<br />\nlevel of a common diversion.<br />\nIf Savitz wants to rank with the<br />\n'big boys', let him put his nickel<br />\nwhere his mouth is. Therefore, on<br />\nbehalf of ATO and all true<br />\ndevotees of pinball wizardry. I<br />\n<br />\nchallenge Savitz to meet just one<br />\nof our top ten men at a time,<br />\nplace, and prize to be mutually<br />\nnegotiated according to the<br />\nprevailing rules of \"machine<br />\netiquette.\"<br />\nTo write an article on the art of<br />\npinball playing and simultaneously<br />\nignore the time-honored bastion of<br />\npinball methodology, was a tragic<br />\noversight which we can only<br />\nascribe to the ignorance of your<br />\nauthor. Proper publication of this<br />\nletter will only begin to rectify the<br />\nunspeakable insult you have dealt<br />\nus.<br />\nIf Savitz wins, fair and square,<br />\nwe will gladly consider him for<br />\nInstallation in the Hall of Fame,<br />\nbut until such time, we will have<br />\nno truck with charlatans and<br />\nusurpers.<br />\nT.

Well, my main man<br />\njust walked in and gaye .me the<br />\nlatest quotes on vegetable matter,<br />\nso, \"sure\", I said, and we<br />\ncompleted a cash-for-plant<br />\ntransaction. Perh4ps this story will<br />\nbe written. But then again, who<br />\ncares?<br />\nAfter all, all I need is a good<br />\nheadline, and it won't matter what<br />\nI write. Something like one of the<br />\nheadlines on the News\u2014Letter<br />\noffice wall, like \"Hunt LSD Gang<br />\nin Slaying of Three\" or \"I Never<br />\nKilled, Manson Sobs,\"(both from<br />\nthe New York Daily News), or<br />\n\"Hopkins Students to Get Totally<br />\nFucked\" (which almost went with<br />\na News\u2014Letter story two years<br />\nago, until one of the editors<br />\nthought better and ripped it out.)<br />\nA good headline, and the readers<br />\nwill read.<br />\nThere are other things on the<br />\nwalls here, like the Bogie poster<br />\nover the blackboard, and the<br />\nspecial News\u2014Letter issued to<br />\ncommemorate the rise of Lincoln<br />\nGordon to the Presidency here,<br />\nwith the headline \"J.H.U.

And<br />\nit's a very good soccer team,<br />\nmolded, casted, and polished by<br />\ncoach Oliver. A graduate of City<br />\nCollege High School in<br />\nBaltimore, Oliver attended<br />\nTowson State College (then<br />\nTowson State Teachers College)<br />\nwhere he continued his soccer<br />\nparticipation from high school.<br />\nIn what he terms the \"Golden<br />\nEra\", as far as soccer is<br />\nconcerned, the Tiger team never<br />\nlost a game while Oliver played.<br />\nWhile completing his graduate<br />\nwork at the University of<br />\nMaryland, he returned to his<br />\nalma mater, City College, to<br />\nteach and coach. After 13 years<br />\nat City College, Oliver changed<br />\nschools and for the last four<br />\n<br />\nyears he has been teaching social<br />\nstudies at Patapsco Senior High<br />\nSchool. Not coaching any sports<br />\nat Patapsco, Oliver coaches<br />\nlacrosse at St. Joe High School,<br />\nwhich restarted its lacrosse<br />\nprogram after a 24 year absence<br />\nof that sport at that parochial<br />\nschool. His first year team won<br />\nthe championship. When Oliver<br />\ncame to Hopkins three years ago,<br />\nhis rookie season was a winning<br />\nseason. Last year when the<br />\nHopkins soccer team went below<br />\n.500 for the season,it marked the<br />\nfirst time in his coaching career<br />\nthat Oliver had a losing season.<br />\nNot only has his sports career<br />\ninvolved participating and<br />\ncoaching but for two years he<br />\nwas a Mason-Dixon Conference<br />\nsoccer referee.<br />\nDuring the three month soccer<br />\nseason, the majority of Oliver's<br />\nthoughts have been with that<br />\n<br />\nNEWSNEETTER<br />\n<br />\nsport. Mr. David Greenwood,<br />\nassistant principal at Patapsco,<br />\ndescribed Oliver as a \"firm but<br />\nfair\" teacher who has a good<br />\nrapport with his students. During<br />\nthe past week at Patapsco,<br />\nOliver's mood has been jovial but<br />\nit is evident that his recent<br />\n3-game losing streak is on his<br />\nmind.<br />\nAt home, Oliver has_a wife and<br />\nfive children, ranging in ages<br />\nfrom six to sixteen. His second<br />\noldest, Kathee, 15, sees hei<br />\n\u2022father having a \"year-round<br />\ndedication\" to soccer. She can<br />\nalways tell whether her father<br />\nwins or loses a game by his facial<br />\nexpressions. \"He is a little more<br />\ntense during the soccer season<br />\nand his emotions and expressions<br />\nare slightly different,\" claims his<br />\ndaughter, \"but he is very<br />\ndedicated even when the season<br />\nis over.\"<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\n<br />\nGreve at his best in marathon<br />\n<br />\niZ<br />\n<br />\nRv JOHN TETZLAFF<br />\nFor a distance runner, the<br />\nultimate test is the marathon.

In the<br />\nmarathon, experience is the main<br />\nfactor in a good time. However,<br />\nJeff ran a remarkable 2:49:15<br />\nlast fall in Philadelphia, despite<br />\nonly two previous attempts at the<br />\nclassic distance, 26 miles, 385<br />\nyards.

At this<br />\nstage in the season, however, he<br />\nfinally seems ready to challenge<br />\nthe top runners who have beaten<br />\nhim in the past. When asked<br />\nabout Greve's running, Coach<br />\nMasken said, \"I'm quite<br />\nsurprised,\" and added that he<br />\nthought that right now, Jeff is<br />\n\"easily better\" than last year's<br />\nnumber one man.<br />\nGreve is a junior Biology major<br />\nand whenever he's not in some<br />\nlab (the runner's plague) or at<br />\npractice, he's probably leading an<br />\nexcursion of the Bicycle Club on<br />\nhis gold Gitane 10 speed.<br />\n<br />\nGreve's work will be cut out<br />\nfor him on Saturday, as the<br />\nharriers face Ursinus and<br />\nDickinson at home. Ursinus<br />\nplaced 1-2-3 against Hopkins last<br />\nyear, and none of those men have<br />\n<br />\ngraduated. If we see a strong race<br />\nfrom Jeff against this stiff<br />\ncompetition, Bluejay prospects<br />\nfor the season will be much<br />\nbrighter.

GOODGOLD<br />\nA seven week manufacturers<br />\ndelay in delivery of the special<br />\nPilkington glass foi the new<br />\nStudent Union's upper floors<br />\nmay delay completion of the<br />\nbuilding beyond the<br />\ncurrently-slated February 1<br />\ncompletion date.<br />\nThe glass was to have arrived<br />\non November 15th, but the<br />\narrival has been pc6tponed to<br />\nJanuary 6th. The glass, which<br />\nwill take at least four weeks to<br />\ninstall is to cover the upper<br />\nfloor's entire exterior wall.<br />\nPilkington glass, made only by<br />\nthe Pilkington Company of St.<br />\nHelen, Lancaster, England, is an<br />\nextremely strong material, able<br />\nto withstand the stress of<br />\nsupporting concrete. The<br />\nPilkington firm has a seven-week<br />\nbacklog of orders, which is<br />\nresponsible for the delay in<br />\ndelivery of the glass, said William<br />\nL. Campbell, Director of Plant<br />\nOperations and Maintenance.<br />\nBecause the glass will not be<br />\ndelivered until the winter, ideal<br />\nweather conditions may not<br />\npersist, according to Campbell.<br />\nExcellent weather is a<br />\nprecondition for the four week<br />\nlong installation of the glass and<br />\nthe weather must be consistently<br />\nthe<br />\ncomplete<br />\n\u2022 good to<br />\nsaid.<br />\nhe<br />\nprocess,<br />\nlong assembly<br />\nAccording to Campbell, if last<br />\nyear's warm weather returns this<br />\nyear, there will be no additional<br />\ndelay past the \"tentative\"<br />\nFebruary 1st completion date.<br />\n\"However,\" Campbell pointed<br />\nout, \"if we get a 15-inch<br />\nsnowstorm, a further delay<br />\nwould be probable.\"<br />\nCampbell also said a seven<br />\noccurred<br />\nweek delay has<br />\nwith delivery of the Student<br />\nUnion's electrical transformer,<br />\noriginally scheduled for<br />\nSeptember 30th. The<br />\npostponement has changed its<br />\narrival to November 11th.<br /><br />\nDean of Students Robert J.<br />\nFitzpatrick insisted that the<br />\nUnion would be used by<br />\nFebruary 1. \"I always forsee<br />\nproblems. (but) we'll use the<br />\ndamn facility anyway. if it isn't<br />\nready, we'll still use it,\" he<br />\nmaintained.<br />\nCampbell pointed out, that<br />\nthere is a penalty clause in the<br />\nschool's contract with J. Vinton<br />\nSchaefer, the construction firm<br />\nbuilding the Union, called a<br />\n'liquidating damages clause'. It<br />\nassesses a fine on the contractor.<br />\nfor each day after the<br />\ntermination date for completion<br />\nhas been set.<br />\nBecause the Union Building<br />\nhas been sponsored as an Housing<br />\nand Urban Development Projea,<br />\nthe liquidating clause is<br />\nmandatory with the HUD<br /><br />\nminimum fee set at $200 for<br />\neach additional day. Instead of<br />\nHopkins borrowing the money<br />\nfrom HUD, it has taken out a<br />\nloan from a commercial bank<br />\nyvith HUD paying the difference<br />\nof the interest (approximately at<br />\n8-9%). Campbell indicated that<br />\nthe firm would be fined the<br />\nminimum amount if work were<br />\nnot completed on schedule.<br />\nAs Campbell noted the most<br />\nimportant factor for completion<br />\n(aside from the delivery of the<br />\nmaterial) would be the weather.<br />\n\"We still have to pour (with<br />\nconcrete) the dining room floor<br />\non October 9th or 10th and pour<br />\nthe exterior wall on October<br />\n12th. Most importantly we still<br />\nhave to waterproof the roof of<br />\nthe building and it all depends<br />\nupon the weather,\" he<br /><br />\nDr. Hugh Kenner and Dr. Buckminster<br />\nestimated 140 to 200 people)<br />\ncommented.<br />\nand as of now three *pianos and<br />\nCampbell also stated that the<br />\nlower level of the Union would<br />\ntwo conference rooms.<br />\nbe completed February 1st.

Furthermore, each May,<br />\nthe house hosts the World<br />\nInvitational Pinball Tournament<br />\nand installs new members in the<br />\nPinball Hall of Fame. To mention<br />\nSavitz's name in the same breath as<br />\nHagan, Roan, Betta or any Hall of<br />\nFarrier reduces the sport to the<br />\nlevel of a common diversion.<br />\nIf Savitz wants to rank with the<br />\n'big boys', let him put his nickel<br />\nwhere his mouth is. Therefore, on<br />\nbehalf of ATO and all true<br />\ndevotees of pinball wizardry. I<br /><br />\nchallenge Savitz to meet just one<br />\nof our top ten men at a time,<br />\nplace, and prize to be mutually<br />\nnegotiated according to the<br />\nprevailing rules of \"machine<br />\netiquette.\"<br />\nTo write an article on the art of<br />\npinball playing and simultaneously<br />\nignore the time-honored bastion of<br />\npinball methodology, was a tragic<br />\noversight which we can only<br />\nascribe to the ignorance of your<br />\nauthor. Proper publication of this<br />\nletter will only begin to rectify the<br />\nunspeakable insult you have dealt<br />\nus.<br />\nIf Savitz wins, fair and square,<br />\nwe will gladly consider him for<br />\nInstallation in the Hall of Fame,<br />\nbut until such time, we will have<br />\nno truck with charlatans and<br />\nusurpers.<br />\nT.

Well, my main man<br />\njust walked in and gaye .me the<br />\nlatest quotes on vegetable matter,<br />\nso, \"sure\", I said, and we<br />\ncompleted a cash-for-plant<br />\ntransaction. Perh4ps this story will<br />\nbe written. But then again, who<br />\ncares?<br />\nAfter all, all I need is a good<br />\nheadline, and it won't matter what<br />\nI write. Something like one of the<br />\nheadlines on the News\u2014Letter<br />\noffice wall, like \"Hunt LSD Gang<br />\nin Slaying of Three\" or \"I Never<br />\nKilled, Manson Sobs,\"(both from<br />\nthe New York Daily News), or<br />\n\"Hopkins Students to Get Totally<br />\nFucked\" (which almost went with<br />\na News\u2014Letter story two years<br />\nago, until one of the editors<br />\nthought better and ripped it out.)<br />\nA good headline, and the readers<br />\nwill read.<br />\nThere are other things on the<br />\nwalls here, like the Bogie poster<br />\nover the blackboard, and the<br />\nspecial News\u2014Letter issued to<br />\ncommemorate the rise of Lincoln<br />\nGordon to the Presidency here,<br />\nwith the headline \"J.H.U.

And<br />\nit's a very good soccer team,<br />\nmolded, casted, and polished by<br />\ncoach Oliver. A graduate of City<br />\nCollege High School in<br />\nBaltimore, Oliver attended<br />\nTowson State College (then<br />\nTowson State Teachers College)<br />\nwhere he continued his soccer<br />\nparticipation from high school.<br />\nIn what he terms the \"Golden<br />\nEra\", as far as soccer is<br />\nconcerned, the Tiger team never<br />\nlost a game while Oliver played.<br />\nWhile completing his graduate<br />\nwork at the University of<br />\nMaryland, he returned to his<br />\nalma mater, City College, to<br />\nteach and coach. After 13 years<br />\nat City College, Oliver changed<br />\nschools and for the last four<br /><br />\nyears he has been teaching social<br />\nstudies at Patapsco Senior High<br />\nSchool. Not coaching any sports<br />\nat Patapsco, Oliver coaches<br />\nlacrosse at St. Joe High School,<br />\nwhich restarted its lacrosse<br />\nprogram after a 24 year absence<br />\nof that sport at that parochial<br />\nschool. His first year team won<br />\nthe championship. When Oliver<br />\ncame to Hopkins three years ago,<br />\nhis rookie season was a winning<br />\nseason. Last year when the<br />\nHopkins soccer team went below<br />\n.500 for the season,it marked the<br />\nfirst time in his coaching career<br />\nthat Oliver had a losing season.<br />\nNot only has his sports career<br />\ninvolved participating and<br />\ncoaching but for two years he<br />\nwas a Mason-Dixon Conference<br />\nsoccer referee.<br />\nDuring the three month soccer<br />\nseason, the majority of Oliver's<br />\nthoughts have been with that<br /><br />\nNEWSNEETTER<br /><br />\nsport. Mr. David Greenwood,<br />\nassistant principal at Patapsco,<br />\ndescribed Oliver as a \"firm but<br />\nfair\" teacher who has a good<br />\nrapport with his students. During<br />\nthe past week at Patapsco,<br />\nOliver's mood has been jovial but<br />\nit is evident that his recent<br />\n3-game losing streak is on his<br />\nmind.<br />\nAt home, Oliver has_a wife and<br />\nfive children, ranging in ages<br />\nfrom six to sixteen. His second<br />\noldest, Kathee, 15, sees hei<br />\n\u2022father having a \"year-round<br />\ndedication\" to soccer. She can<br />\nalways tell whether her father<br />\nwins or loses a game by his facial<br />\nexpressions. \"He is a little more<br />\ntense during the soccer season<br />\nand his emotions and expressions<br />\nare slightly different,\" claims his<br />\ndaughter, \"but he is very<br />\ndedicated even when the season<br />\nis over.\"<br /><br />\nsports<br /><br />\nGreve at his best in marathon<br /><br />\niZ<br /><br />\nRv JOHN TETZLAFF<br />\nFor a distance runner, the<br />\nultimate test is the marathon. If<br />\nhe can put up with the endless<br />\nhours of training, and have the<br />\nraw courage to face the gruesome<br />\nlast five miles of the race, then he<br />\ndeserves the title of \"distance<br />\nrunner.\" This is where the leader<br />\nof the cross-country team, junior<br />\nJeff Greve, is at his best.<br />\nAlthough he seems ready to<br />\nhave a great cross-country season,<br />\nGreve still feels that his best race<br />\nis anything over 10 miles. In the<br />\nmarathon, experience is the main<br />\nfactor in a good time. However,<br />\nJeff ran a remarkable 2:49:15<br />\nlast fall in Philadelphia, despite<br />\nonly two previous attempts at the<br />\nclassic distance, 26 miles, 385<br />\nyards. And he's already psyched<br />\nto lower that time in the<br />\nupcoming Baltimore marathon.<br />\njust after the cross-country<br />\nseason.<br />\nDespite good stamina and<br />\nmore drive than most runners<br />\nhave, Something held the Bluejay<br />\ncaptain back from becoming a<br />\nreally dominant runner. At this<br />\nstage in the season, however, he<br />\nfinally seems ready to challenge<br />\nthe top runners who have beaten<br />\nhim in the past. When asked<br />\nabout Greve's running, Coach<br />\nMasken said, \"I'm quite<br />\nsurprised,\" and added that he<br />\nthought that right now, Jeff is<br />\n\"easily better\" than last year's<br />\nnumber one man.<br />\nGreve is a junior Biology major<br />\nand whenever he's not in some<br />\nlab (the runner's plague) or at<br />\npractice, he's probably leading an<br />\nexcursion of the Bicycle Club on<br />\nhis gold Gitane 10 speed.<br /><br />\nGreve's work will be cut out<br />\nfor him on Saturday, as the<br />\nharriers face Ursinus and<br />\nDickinson at home. Ursinus<br />\nplaced 1-2-3 against Hopkins last<br />\nyear, and none of those men have<br /><br />\ngraduated. If we see a strong race<br />\nfrom Jeff against this stiff<br />\ncompetition, Bluejay prospects<br />\nfor the season will be much<br />\nbrighter.
