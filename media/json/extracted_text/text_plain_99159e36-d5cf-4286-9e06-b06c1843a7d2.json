The problem of<br />\nfreshman drinking is a direct<br />\nconcern of the Council. The assembly program is badly in need<br />\nof management. The parking<br />\nproblem for the undergraduate<br />\nhas also been badly neglected.<br />\nprogram<br />\nThe advisor-advisee<br />\nmust be strengthened. There is<br />\nalso a need for better understanding between the faculty<br />\nand the students.\"<br />\nSalem: \"School spirit can be<br />\nand should be improved by making students more aware of the<br />\nschool's background and by increasing participation in school<br />\nevents. There should be a board<br />\nworking along with the Cotillion<br />\nBoard in the scheduling of campus activities with the purpose<br />\nof preventing conflicting dates,<br />\nnot only with school dances and<br />\nfraternity parties, but also with<br />\nvacations and off campus activities. There should be a greater number of assemblies, and the<br />\nproblem of scheduling should be<br />\nlooked into. The advising system should be improved and the<br />\nadvisability of the posting of<br />\ngrades and failure lists should<br />\nbe investigated. The parking<br />\nproblem should definitely be<br />\nlooked into.\"<br />\n2) What is the function and<br />\npurpose of the Council?<br />\nLupovich: \"The Council should<br />\nserve to acquaint the faculty<br />\nwith the concerns of the under-<br />\n<br />\nLupovich: \"When the Council<br />\nis dealing with inconsequential<br />\nthings, there is naturally little<br />\ninterest. When it is dealing with<br />\nmatters that affect each individual, the individual (s) respond accordingly. For example,<br />\nthe faculty's appropriation of<br />\ntwenty extra parking spaces. on<br />\nShriver Hall lot. There is no student disinterest and no remedy<br />\nis needed, therefore.\"<br />\nSalem: \"In many cases there<br />\nis not. There is not enough emphasis on Student Council reports at class meetings. The<br />\nprinting and posting of the minutes of the meetings of the<br />\nCouncil should be strictly observed. The student suggestion<br />\nbox should be more publicized.\"<br />\n5) Do the Council's committees work well and if not, is<br />\nthere any remedy?<br />\nLupovich: \"I think the committees do work well although<br />\nthey should meet at least once<br />\na week. Committees should do<br />\ntheir work in committee, and<br />\nthe Council as a whole should<br />\ntake action on their suggestions.\"<br />\nSalem: \"Some of the committees of he Council do not work<br />\nnearly as well as they should.<br />\nThe<br />\nvice-president<br />\nCouncil<br />\nshould submit to each committee<br />\nchairman an outline of his duties<br />\nand functions based on reports<br />\nand recommendations of past<br />\ncommittee chairmen. He should<br />\nkeep close personal contact with<br />\nthese committees during the<br />\nyear to see that they are working as planned.<br />\n6) What is the role of the<br />\nCouncil president?<br />\npresident<br />\nLupovich: \"T h e<br />\nshould set the pace for the rest<br />\nof the members. He should coordinate, by being present at all<br />\ncommittee meeetings, the action<br />\nof these committees; he should<br />\nmotivate these committees by<br />\nlending ideas to them; ultimate4) Is there enough student in- ly, he should tie these committerest in the Council. If not, tees together into a Student<br />\nCouncil by being thoroughly<br />\nwould you suggest a remedy?<br />\n<br />\ngraduates. It should serve also<br />\nto effect a practical solution to<br />\nthese concerns. Likewise, the<br />\nfaculty should use the Council<br />\nreciprocally. It should also act<br />\nas a coordinating and unifying<br />\nand spirited body through which<br />\nall activities can maintain their<br />\nindividuality, and identification<br />\nwith activities in general. The<br />\nCouncil's purpose is illustrated<br />\nby its functions.\"<br />\nSalem: \"The function of the<br />\nStudent Council is to coordinate<br />\nall campus activities. Its purpose<br />\nis to see that the students are<br />\nfairly represented to the administration and faculty and to keep<br />\na smooth and friendly relationship between the student body<br />\nand these groups. It is to seek<br />\nsolutions to the many problems<br />\nthat may arise at any time on<br />\ncampus and to represent the<br />\nschool in all public events.\"<br />\n3) How can the Council improve faculty-student relations?<br />\nLupovich: \"The faculty-student relationship should be a<br />\nTEACHgR-STUDENT relationship. The way to achieve this is<br />\nto suggest to the faculty a<br />\nstrengthened a dvis o r-advisee<br />\nprogram. A student should feel<br />\nfree at all times to consult his<br />\nadvisor concerning personal or<br />\nacademic problems. It is the<br />\nCouncil's responsibility to increase the faculty's awareness<br />\nof their obligations, other than<br />\nacademic, to the students.\"<br />\nSalem: \"The faculty-student<br />\nrelations could be greatly improved by increasing the number<br />\nof faculty advisers and by setting definite times during the<br />\nyear for them to meet. More<br />\nevents in which the faculty<br />\nmembers participate should be<br />\nsponsored. The Council should<br />\nencourage more faculty attendance at all school functions,<br />\nespecially sports events and<br />\ndances.<br />\n<br />\nfamiliar with the problems, ideas<br />\nand solutions and suggestions of<br />\nthese committees. In addition,<br />\nit should be his responsibility to<br />\nbe aware of the proceedings of<br />\nall other campus activities.<br />\nWhy? Because he alone ..is responsible to the administration,<br />\nthe students and to himself for<br />\nthe action of the Student Council.\"<br />\nSalem: \"The Student Council<br />\npresident represents the entire<br />\nStudent Council in the eyes of<br />\nthe university. He should maintain the Council as an efficient,<br />\norganization. He<br />\nbusinesslike<br />\nshould appoint committee chair-,<br />\nmen and committees and be the<br />\nguiding light behind the vicepresident in seeing that these<br />\ncommittees are well run. The<br />\npresident - should have personal<br />\ncontact weekly with all campus<br />\nand<br />\npresidents<br />\norganization<br />\ntheir advisers, seeking ideas for<br />\nthe betterment of the school<br />\nand solutions to problems. He<br />\nshould keep in close contact with<br />\nthe president of the University,<br />\nthe dean, and other university<br />\nofficials.<br />\n7) Define the Gentleman's<br />\nCode and non-academlc honor,<br />\nand relate the Council's duties<br />\ntoward enforcing these concepts?<br />\nLupovich: \"The Gentleman's<br />\nCode by definition implies a way<br />\nof life. We all live together in<br />\ncotrimunity of self-imposed<br />\nmoral obligations. We are bounded by our personal 'moral obligations'. The Gentleman's_ Code<br />\ndoes not define for us these<br />\nmoral obligations,, or a way of<br />\nlife, but rather points the way<br />\ntowards these ideals. It would<br />\nseem to me to be rather hypocritical to live about eighteen<br />\nhours a week with a moral code<br />\nand the \u2022\u2022\u2022st of the hours to live<br />\nin a moral vacuum relative to<br />\nthe Code. The Council has no<br />\nduty toward enforcing the Gentleman's Code. The Code is a<br />\npersonal thing. It's not an entity<br />\nbut neither is it a non-entity.

He should respect, in<br />\nparticular, the property of the<br />\nschool and act in such a way as<br />\nto uphold the reputation of the<br />\nschool. It is every student's<br />\nresponsibility to see that these<br />\nideals are upheld. The Student<br />\nCouncil should take definite<br />\nstands on matters of drinking,<br />\nconduct at public affairs, and<br />\ngeneral attitudes of students.<br />\nThese stands should be made<br />\nknown to the student body.

The following is part<br />\nof his speech.<br />\nWhat did existentialism give<br />\nto Christianity? First, there is<br />\na statement by Kant in which he<br />\nsays, \"We praise the great luck<br />\nwhich human reason has had<br />\nwith mathematics, in which<br />\nhuman reason was able to<br />\nanalyze and to control reality.\"<br />\nFor all situations, I would<br />\nspeak of the great luck theology<br />\nhad in becoming allied with the<br />\nexistentialist philosophical movement. Because existentialism<br />\nhas rediscovered man's predicament in a depth, in a radicalism,<br />\nin a profundity, and in a Melancholic and heroic way which was<br />\nnot seen for centuries because ofthe victory of the philosophy of<br />\nconsciousness<br />\nand<br />\nmoralistic<br />\nProtestantism.<br />\n<br />\nDR. PAUL J. TILLICH<br />\n<br />\nLet me speak, then about these<br />\ngifts existentialism has given to<br />\nChristianity. The first was the<br />\ndiscovery that man is finite. Of<br />\n<br />\ncourse this was known all the between yes and no; between<br />\ntime. Every man has always being and non-being; between<br />\nknown that he has to die.<br />\nlife and death; between courage<br />\nBut something very interest- and despair. This was the dising happened in the beginnings tinction between finitude and<br />\nof industrial society. Death was<br />\nremoved from public talk. You<br />\nstill have remnants of this early<br />\n18th Century attitude in this<br />\ncountry. Death cannot be mentioned; the dead have to be<br />\nbeautified in a limy which is<br />\nmore horrible than the most ugly<br />\nform of real serious death, which<br />\nis not beautified.<br />\n<br />\nanxiety which was made bY<br />\nexistentialists of all types and<br />\nwhich was made also by depth<br />\npsychology.<br />\nLike the beating of the heart,<br />\nof which we are by no means<br />\nalways conscious, the beating of<br />\nanxiety is a characteristic of<br />\nevery human being. It breaks\"<br />\nout with the surface in special<br />\nmoments, but can break into<br />\n-the surface only because it is in<br />\nthe undergraoun.<br />\nThe other discoveiy was that<br />\nman is not only finite, but that<br />\nhe is estranged. This word estrangement was, interestina<br />\nenough, first used by the essentialist Hegel. The reality of men<br />\nis the reality of estrangement.<br />\n<br />\nBut, this was a tendency and<br />\nthis tendency meant man is only<br />\nseemingly finite, he is not really<br />\nfinite. The large amount of<br />\nprimitive belief in life after<br />\ndeath as a simple continuation<br />\nof this life contributed to this<br />\nself-deception.<br />\nSince<br />\nPascal,<br />\npeople again saw the greatness<br />\nand, at the same time, the misery of men; his finitude, his having to die and the seriousness<br />\nExistentialism, has rediscovof death. This cannot be overered that man is in conflict with<br />\ncome by beautifying corpses.<br />\nwhat he essentially is and thereSomething else is covered in fore, ought to be; that man<br />\nalliance with depth psychology. stands against himself. In classiThere is something hidden in cal theology this is called in or<br />\nman\u2014the awareness of his even original sin\u2014words which<br />\nfinitude, of his being a mixture have lost their power for most<br />\npeople today.<br />\nIn classical theology this<br />\nmeans separation or estrangement from God and also froni<br />\none's own being and from one's<br />\nworld, including the other one.<br />\nIt means the human predicament contradicts its own nature.<br />\nThis is true of the individual<br />\nsituation as well as of the social<br />\nsituation.<br />\nMan is estranged from the<br />\nground of his being. He is estranged from himself and his is<br />\nestranged from \"the other one.<br />\nThis estrangement is the most<br />\ncharacteristic form of his predicament.

It shouldn't surprise you then that it took some time before John<br />\nJackson discovered the one brand of mathematics that seemed customtailored to his ability and temperament. John is an Applied Science Representative, working out of the IBM office at 122 East 42nd Street, N. Y. C.<br />\nFirst of all, what's it all about? What<br />\ndoes a fellow like John Jackson do<br />\nall day? In his own words, \"I keep<br />\nin touch with the executives of many<br />\ndifferent companies\u2014advising them<br />\non the use of their IBM electronic<br />\ndata processing computers. I personally consult with these customers,<br />\nand analyze their scientific and technical problems for solution by IBM.<br />\nOccasionally, I'm asked to write<br />\npapers, and give talks and demonstrations on electronic computing.<br />\nAll in all, it's pretty fascinating ...<br />\nsomething new pops up every day.\"<br />\nIn other words, John is a full-fledged<br />\ncomputing expert, a consultant ...<br />\nand a very important person in this<br />\n<br />\nThe aircraft people decided that they<br />\ncouldn't afford to wait that long, so<br />\nthey called in IBM. After discussion<br />\nwith top executives, John helped to<br />\nmap out a computer program that<br />\nsaved the organization over 100 days<br />\n<br />\nmathematical background in both of<br />\nthose areas. It was not until he was<br />\ninterviewed by IBM that field computing whetted his scientific appetite.<br />\nA few months later, John launched<br />\nhis own IBM career as an Applied<br />\nScience trainee.<br />\nPromotionwise, John has come a<br />\nlong way since that time. He's now<br />\nan Applied Science Representative in<br />\none of the busiest, most responsible<br />\noffices in the IBM organization ...<br />\nmid-town Manhattan.<br />\nWith his wife, Katherine, and<br />\ndaughter.

Later, for this same company,<br />\nJohn organized the establishment of<br />\ncomputer systems for aircraft performance predctions . . . for data<br />\nreduction of wind tunnel tests ... and<br />\nfor wing stress analysis. At the same<br />\ntime, he worked with this company's<br />\nown employees, training them in the<br />\nuse of IBM equipment. John still<br />\ndrops around to see that everything<br />\nis running smoothly.<br />\n<br />\nSince the IBM laboratories are<br />\nalways devising easier and faster ways<br />\nto solve the problems of science, government, and industry, an Applied<br />\nScience Representative can never say<br />\nhe's learned his job and that's the<br />\nend of it. At least once every two<br />\nmonths, he attends seminars to be<br />\nupdated on the latest developments in<br />\nengineering and operations research.,<br />\n<br />\nAnother service that John performs<br />\nis the constant reappraisal of each<br />\ncustomer's IBM operation. Occasionally, a customer may tie himself in<br />\nknots over a procedural \"stickler.\"<br />\nPeriodically, in fact, John brings<br />\nIBM customers together ... just to<br />\ntalk over what's happening in each<br />\nother's business\u2014how everybody else<br />\nhandled that old bugaboo in any<br />\nindustry... details.<br />\n<br />\nIntroduces new methods<br />\nDuring the two years that John<br />\nhas spent with IBM in Applied Science, he has guided innumerable IBM<br />\ncustomers to new and better ways of<br />\ndoing things electronically. For example: about a year ago, a leading<br />\naircraft manufacturer wanted to experiment with a radically different<br />\ndesign for a nuclear reactor. Although<br />\nthe basic format had been established,<br />\nthe project still required many months<br />\nof toil with mathematical equations.<br />\n<br />\nJohn is exercising his mathematical<br />\nknow-how in a field that was practically unheard of ten years ago. Even<br />\nnow, this kind of work may be news<br />\nto you. It was to John Jackson a few<br />\nyears back when he was an undergraduate at the University of Colorado. At that time, he was considering<br />\nactuarial work or mathematical research. But John liked the excitement<br />\nand diversification of science and industry and he wanted to use his<br />\n<br />\nNew field for Mathematicians<br />\n<br />\nDiscussing a problem with colleagues<br />\n<br />\nJr., 6 weeks, he enjoys his suburban<br />\nPort Washington home. He's happy<br />\nand he's satisfied. And then, too, John<br />\nknows a few vital statistics about<br />\nIBM .:. such as the fact that the<br />\nApplied Science Division has quadrupled during the past three years,<br />\nand that in 1956 alone, over 70 promotions were conferred. If ever a<br />\nfuture held promise, here is one.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIBM hopes that this message will help<br />\nto give you some idea of what a mathematician can do at IBM.

MIT requires engineering<br />\nstudents to study English and History beyond the elementary level; Princeton's new president is a classics scholar,<br />\nand last spring, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, in a<br />\nspeech at Goucher College, said \"humanities are needed to<br />\ngive direction to the multiple innovations of modern science.\"<br />\nLast month, Barry Wood, Jr., vice-president of the<br />\nHopkins Hospital, suggested humanities courses be a<br />\nrequired part of the Medical School curriculum, and<br />\nPresident Milton Eisenhower called for more funds to fill<br />\nfaculty vacancies, especially in the humanities and social<br />\nsciences. The need for humanities is being re-established.<br />\nYet at Johns Hopkins, the humanities faculty regrettably will soon lose such scholars as George Boas, Leo<br />\nSpitzer, and George Poullet. The problems raised by their<br />\nimminent retirement from the faculty are: how to get<br />\nother professors adequate to fill their particular vacancies, and how to raise a sufficient amount of money to<br />\nattract other outstanding scholars to Hopkins. Basically,<br />\nthe problems are financial.<br />\nThe attendant problem of maintaining full ranks in a<br />\nsuperior humanities faculty is that of attracting to the<br />\nundergraduate body the best students the nation's high<br />\nschool system can offer. The present freshman class<br />\ndraws only 30% of its enrollment from the top ten percent of America's high school classrooms. This statistical<br />\nmediocrity can be remedied partially through a strengthened faculty. Assuming a better calibre undergraduate student would be attracted here by an improved faculty, we<br />\nalso assume that the degree of Hopkins' academic excellence would be raised by the competition to be admitted<br />\nto the University and by the subsequently wider range<br />\nof superior students from which the admissions office<br />\ncould select freshmen. Further, both presidents Gilman<br />\nand Eisenhower said Hopkins should stand in the forefront of American education\u2014should set the standards.<br />\nThis goal is impaired by a lack of funds-with which<br />\nto form and hold together a faculty of superior research<br />\nand teaching ability\u2014a faculty that would attract with<br />\nequal drawing power outstanding students to both the<br />\nundergraduate and graduate schools.<br />\nIn light of the recent trend to stress humanities,<br />\neven in technical curricula, and in view of the imminent<br />\nretirement of several outstanding humanities scholars,<br />\nwe suggest: improve faculty salaries and thereby the University's degree of academic excellence, especially in the<br />\nhumanities, and not bother to waste money to send the<br />\nlacrosse team to England (it would suffice for the team<br />\nto win the National Championship, after 7 years).

The<br />\naccurate reporting of scientific<br />\nnews, written interestingly but<br />\nnot\u2022 sensationally, is a more and<br />\nmOre important element of public education. There has been<br />\nmuch discussion regarding the<br />\nbest way to secure this. All too<br />\nfrequently the science news to<br />\nbe read in our daily papers is<br />\nsensational in tone, stressing the<br />\n\"magical\" achievements of science, or is grossly inaccurate, so<br />\nas to leave readers with a completely erroneous impression of<br />\nthe facts. If the situation is<br />\nto be corrected, we must have<br />\nscience reporters who recognize<br />\ntheir own limitations as well as<br />\ntheir capacities, and in matters<br />\nwith which they are not entirely<br />\nfamiliar are as careful to be accurate as the scientists themselves. This means, in most<br />\ncases, that the reporter, irksome<br />\nthough he finds it, must check<br />\nhis story with his sources after<br />\nit is written. The writing of scientific news in a newspaper representing one of our great scientific research institutions ought<br />\nto set an example of good science-writing for our daily newspapers, and not the reverse.<br />\nIt is for these reasons that I<br />\ndeplore the sensational and inaccurate features of the story on<br />\nthe vitamin B,.2 experiment. I<br />\nrefer particularly to the headline, which stresses \"radioactive<br />\ninjections\" as though they were<br />\ndangerous instead of being in<br />\nthe infinitesimal amounts used<br />\nin all physiological tracer experiments; the caption under<br />\n<br />\nthe photograph, which actuallY<br />\nimplies that a month of listlessness might result from such an<br />\ninjection; and the two last paragraphs of the story, which miX<br />\nunfounded r um or s floating<br />\namong the students with my own<br />\nstatements in a most confusing<br />\nfashion. Let it be understood<br />\nthat I did not say that \"another<br />\npossible after-effect is feeling of<br />\nlistlessness for perhaps a month<br />\nafter the test.\" This was a baseless rumor which I tried to<br />\nscotch in no uncertain terms.<br />\nThe radio-activity of the dose<br />\ntaken is approximately .0003 r\u2014<br />\nabout the amount received froni<br />\nwearing a wristwatch with luminous dial for 3 days (not one<br />\nyear, as the story states). There<br />\nare no known aftereffects of<br />\ntaking doses of vitamin B12 111<br />\nthe amounts we used, except<br />\nbeneficial ones. In other words,<br />\nthe risk to the volunteers was<br />\nnegligible and the possible scientific rewards of such an experiment very great. Otherwise I<br />\nwould not have asked my students to participate in it, nor<br />\nhave done so myself, as I did.\"'<br />\nfeel that an injustice has been<br />\ndone to Dr. Patricia McIntYre,<br />\nDr. Julius Krevans, and to Me<br />\nfar beyond the mere misspelling<br />\nof our names.

We will stick to<br />\nthe 'T'!\"<br />\nBridgers believes that the shift<br />\nfrom the single wing will be no<br />\nproblem at all, because \"the<br />\ntackle play in pro ball is similar<br />\nto the play of a strong side<br />\ntackle in the balanced-line single<br />\nwing formation.\"<br />\n\"The most difficult aspect of<br />\nmy new job will be the adjustment from coaching college boys<br />\nwith little or no experience to<br />\nthe coaching of professionals<br />\nwho have had from one to twelve<br />\nyears of pro experience,\" replied<br />\nBridgers to a News-Letter question.<br />\nThe new job of the former<br />\nJay coach entails year-round attention. During the off season,<br />\n<br />\nthe coaching staff works on the<br />\ndefenses and offenses of both<br />\nthe Colts and their opponents.<br />\nMovies are used to type team<br />\nand individual capabilities. Also,<br />\nduring this time the play-books<br />\nfor the coming season are arranged.<br />\nNew Opportunity<br />\nBridgers stated, \"I am looking forward to this new opportunity. I know that I will enjoy<br />\nmy work, and I hope to learn a<br />\nlot more about football. I hate<br />\nto leave Hopkins mainly because<br />\nof the high standing of the university and the type of boys who<br />\nattend the school.\"<br />\nWhen asked what he considered his most outstanding victory while at Hopkins, Bridgers<br />\nnamed two dates. According to<br />\nBridgers, his most surprising victory came in 1955 when the Jays<br />\nMaryland,<br />\nWestern<br />\ntrounced<br />\n33-0, to end a diSmal season on<br />\na happy note. The victory that<br />\ngave the new Colt coach the<br />\nmost satisfaction was the 1956<br />\nvictory over the Terrors. Bridgers said, \"The 1956 victory accomplished so many things that<br />\nwe had been trying to do for so<br />\nlong.\"<br />\nPotential Champs<br />\nThe former Jay coach urged<br />\nany boy to go out for the Hopkins football team, because a<br />\ngreat deal can be gained from<br />\nfootball.\" Next year's team,<br />\nadded Bridgers, \"though not as<br />\nlast<br />\nyear's<br />\nexperienced<br />\nas<br />\nchampions has the size and potential to improve last year's<br />\nrecord. Many thing, however,<br />\ncould alter this situation.\"<br />\nBridgers was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and attended<br />\nRamsay High School, where he<br />\nlettered in football and baseball.<br />\nHe attended Auburn where he<br />\nagain lettered in football. Bridgers served in the Army from<br />\n1943 to 1946, during which time<br />\nhe not only rose to the rank of<br />\ncaptain, but also coached football, track, and baseball. After<br />\nthe war, he returned to Auburn<br />\nand received a degree in economics and business administration. In 1946 Bridgers served<br />\nthe dual role of football coach<br />\nof the \"B\" team and economics<br />\ninstructor at Auburn. In the fall<br />\n<br />\nof 1947 he moved to Sewanee as<br />\nassistant football coach and head<br />\ntrack coach. His six year stay<br />\nthere was interrupted by a one<br />\nyear tour of duty in Japan where<br />\nhe again coached football for<br />\nthe Army. In July, 1953, Bridgers became head football and<br />\ntrack coach at Hopkins.<br />\nBridgers said, \"In my four<br />\nyears at Hopkins I have learned<br />\nmore football than in my eight<br />\nprevious years in coaching.<br />\nPrior to coming to Hopkins I<br />\nhad only one unvictorious season.\"<br />\n\"No Comment\"<br />\nWhen asked if there was anything about the Hopkins athletic situation that he would like<br />\nto see changed, Bridgers declined<br />\ncomment saying that it would<br />\ndo no good to enumerate the<br />\n4.<br />\nfaults of ,the system.<br />\nBridgers stated his appreciation for all the cooperation given<br />\nto him by the News-Letter.<br />\n<br />\nFrosh Trackmen<br />\nPlease Bridgers<br />\nThrough Turnout<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nAfter su-rveying the turnout of<br />\n30 hopefuls for the Frosh track<br />\nJohn Bridgers is shown in one of the happier moments of<br />\nteam, Coach John Bridgers re- his four-year stay at Hopkins.

The problem of<br />\nfreshman drinking is a direct<br />\nconcern of the Council. The assembly program is badly in need<br />\nof management. The parking<br />\nproblem for the undergraduate<br />\nhas also been badly neglected.<br />\nprogram<br />\nThe advisor-advisee<br />\nmust be strengthened. There is<br />\nalso a need for better understanding between the faculty<br />\nand the students.\"<br />\nSalem: \"School spirit can be<br />\nand should be improved by making students more aware of the<br />\nschool's background and by increasing participation in school<br />\nevents. There should be a board<br />\nworking along with the Cotillion<br />\nBoard in the scheduling of campus activities with the purpose<br />\nof preventing conflicting dates,<br />\nnot only with school dances and<br />\nfraternity parties, but also with<br />\nvacations and off campus activities. There should be a greater number of assemblies, and the<br />\nproblem of scheduling should be<br />\nlooked into. The advising system should be improved and the<br />\nadvisability of the posting of<br />\ngrades and failure lists should<br />\nbe investigated. The parking<br />\nproblem should definitely be<br />\nlooked into.\"<br />\n2) What is the function and<br />\npurpose of the Council?<br />\nLupovich: \"The Council should<br />\nserve to acquaint the faculty<br />\nwith the concerns of the under-<br /><br />\nLupovich: \"When the Council<br />\nis dealing with inconsequential<br />\nthings, there is naturally little<br />\ninterest. When it is dealing with<br />\nmatters that affect each individual, the individual (s) respond accordingly. For example,<br />\nthe faculty's appropriation of<br />\ntwenty extra parking spaces. on<br />\nShriver Hall lot. There is no student disinterest and no remedy<br />\nis needed, therefore.\"<br />\nSalem: \"In many cases there<br />\nis not. There is not enough emphasis on Student Council reports at class meetings. The<br />\nprinting and posting of the minutes of the meetings of the<br />\nCouncil should be strictly observed. The student suggestion<br />\nbox should be more publicized.\"<br />\n5) Do the Council's committees work well and if not, is<br />\nthere any remedy?<br />\nLupovich: \"I think the committees do work well although<br />\nthey should meet at least once<br />\na week. Committees should do<br />\ntheir work in committee, and<br />\nthe Council as a whole should<br />\ntake action on their suggestions.\"<br />\nSalem: \"Some of the committees of he Council do not work<br />\nnearly as well as they should.<br />\nThe<br />\nvice-president<br />\nCouncil<br />\nshould submit to each committee<br />\nchairman an outline of his duties<br />\nand functions based on reports<br />\nand recommendations of past<br />\ncommittee chairmen. He should<br />\nkeep close personal contact with<br />\nthese committees during the<br />\nyear to see that they are working as planned.<br />\n6) What is the role of the<br />\nCouncil president?<br />\npresident<br />\nLupovich: \"T h e<br />\nshould set the pace for the rest<br />\nof the members. He should coordinate, by being present at all<br />\ncommittee meeetings, the action<br />\nof these committees; he should<br />\nmotivate these committees by<br />\nlending ideas to them; ultimate4) Is there enough student in- ly, he should tie these committerest in the Council. If not, tees together into a Student<br />\nCouncil by being thoroughly<br />\nwould you suggest a remedy?<br /><br />\ngraduates. It should serve also<br />\nto effect a practical solution to<br />\nthese concerns. Likewise, the<br />\nfaculty should use the Council<br />\nreciprocally. It should also act<br />\nas a coordinating and unifying<br />\nand spirited body through which<br />\nall activities can maintain their<br />\nindividuality, and identification<br />\nwith activities in general. The<br />\nCouncil's purpose is illustrated<br />\nby its functions.\"<br />\nSalem: \"The function of the<br />\nStudent Council is to coordinate<br />\nall campus activities. Its purpose<br />\nis to see that the students are<br />\nfairly represented to the administration and faculty and to keep<br />\na smooth and friendly relationship between the student body<br />\nand these groups. It is to seek<br />\nsolutions to the many problems<br />\nthat may arise at any time on<br />\ncampus and to represent the<br />\nschool in all public events.\"<br />\n3) How can the Council improve faculty-student relations?<br />\nLupovich: \"The faculty-student relationship should be a<br />\nTEACHgR-STUDENT relationship. The way to achieve this is<br />\nto suggest to the faculty a<br />\nstrengthened a dvis o r-advisee<br />\nprogram. A student should feel<br />\nfree at all times to consult his<br />\nadvisor concerning personal or<br />\nacademic problems. It is the<br />\nCouncil's responsibility to increase the faculty's awareness<br />\nof their obligations, other than<br />\nacademic, to the students.\"<br />\nSalem: \"The faculty-student<br />\nrelations could be greatly improved by increasing the number<br />\nof faculty advisers and by setting definite times during the<br />\nyear for them to meet. More<br />\nevents in which the faculty<br />\nmembers participate should be<br />\nsponsored. The Council should<br />\nencourage more faculty attendance at all school functions,<br />\nespecially sports events and<br />\ndances.<br /><br />\nfamiliar with the problems, ideas<br />\nand solutions and suggestions of<br />\nthese committees. In addition,<br />\nit should be his responsibility to<br />\nbe aware of the proceedings of<br />\nall other campus activities.<br />\nWhy? Because he alone ..is responsible to the administration,<br />\nthe students and to himself for<br />\nthe action of the Student Council.\"<br />\nSalem: \"The Student Council<br />\npresident represents the entire<br />\nStudent Council in the eyes of<br />\nthe university. He should maintain the Council as an efficient,<br />\norganization. He<br />\nbusinesslike<br />\nshould appoint committee chair-,<br />\nmen and committees and be the<br />\nguiding light behind the vicepresident in seeing that these<br />\ncommittees are well run. The<br />\npresident - should have personal<br />\ncontact weekly with all campus<br />\nand<br />\npresidents<br />\norganization<br />\ntheir advisers, seeking ideas for<br />\nthe betterment of the school<br />\nand solutions to problems. He<br />\nshould keep in close contact with<br />\nthe president of the University,<br />\nthe dean, and other university<br />\nofficials.<br />\n7) Define the Gentleman's<br />\nCode and non-academlc honor,<br />\nand relate the Council's duties<br />\ntoward enforcing these concepts?<br />\nLupovich: \"The Gentleman's<br />\nCode by definition implies a way<br />\nof life. We all live together in<br />\ncotrimunity of self-imposed<br />\nmoral obligations. We are bounded by our personal 'moral obligations'. The Gentleman's_ Code<br />\ndoes not define for us these<br />\nmoral obligations,, or a way of<br />\nlife, but rather points the way<br />\ntowards these ideals. It would<br />\nseem to me to be rather hypocritical to live about eighteen<br />\nhours a week with a moral code<br />\nand the \u2022\u2022\u2022st of the hours to live<br />\nin a moral vacuum relative to<br />\nthe Code. The Council has no<br />\nduty toward enforcing the Gentleman's Code. The Code is a<br />\npersonal thing. It's not an entity<br />\nbut neither is it a non-entity.

To me it<br />\nmeans that every student should<br />\nact as a gentleman and respect<br />\nthe property and feelings of<br />\nothers. He should respect, in<br />\nparticular, the property of the<br />\nschool and act in such a way as<br />\nto uphold the reputation of the<br />\nschool.

The following is part<br />\nof his speech.<br />\nWhat did existentialism give<br />\nto Christianity? First, there is<br />\na statement by Kant in which he<br />\nsays, \"We praise the great luck<br />\nwhich human reason has had<br />\nwith mathematics, in which<br />\nhuman reason was able to<br />\nanalyze and to control reality.\"<br />\nFor all situations, I would<br />\nspeak of the great luck theology<br />\nhad in becoming allied with the<br />\nexistentialist philosophical movement. Because existentialism<br />\nhas rediscovered man's predicament in a depth, in a radicalism,<br />\nin a profundity, and in a Melancholic and heroic way which was<br />\nnot seen for centuries because ofthe victory of the philosophy of<br />\nconsciousness<br />\nand<br />\nmoralistic<br />\nProtestantism.<br /><br />\nDR. PAUL J. TILLICH<br /><br />\nLet me speak, then about these<br />\ngifts existentialism has given to<br />\nChristianity. The first was the<br />\ndiscovery that man is finite. Of<br /><br />\ncourse this was known all the between yes and no; between<br />\ntime. Every man has always being and non-being; between<br />\nknown that he has to die.<br />\nlife and death; between courage<br />\nBut something very interest- and despair. This was the dising happened in the beginnings tinction between finitude and<br />\nof industrial society. Death was<br />\nremoved from public talk. You<br />\nstill have remnants of this early<br />\n18th Century attitude in this<br />\ncountry. Death cannot be mentioned; the dead have to be<br />\nbeautified in a limy which is<br />\nmore horrible than the most ugly<br />\nform of real serious death, which<br />\nis not beautified.<br /><br />\nanxiety which was made bY<br />\nexistentialists of all types and<br />\nwhich was made also by depth<br />\npsychology.<br />\nLike the beating of the heart,<br />\nof which we are by no means<br />\nalways conscious, the beating of<br />\nanxiety is a characteristic of<br />\nevery human being. It breaks\"<br />\nout with the surface in special<br />\nmoments, but can break into<br />\n-the surface only because it is in<br />\nthe undergraoun.<br />\nThe other discoveiy was that<br />\nman is not only finite, but that<br />\nhe is estranged. This word estrangement was, interestina<br />\nenough, first used by the essentialist Hegel. The reality of men<br />\nis the reality of estrangement.<br /><br />\nBut, this was a tendency and<br />\nthis tendency meant man is only<br />\nseemingly finite, he is not really<br />\nfinite. The large amount of<br />\nprimitive belief in life after<br />\ndeath as a simple continuation<br />\nof this life contributed to this<br />\nself-deception.<br />\nSince<br />\nPascal,<br />\npeople again saw the greatness<br />\nand, at the same time, the misery of men; his finitude, his having to die and the seriousness<br />\nExistentialism, has rediscovof death. This cannot be overered that man is in conflict with<br />\ncome by beautifying corpses.<br />\nwhat he essentially is and thereSomething else is covered in fore, ought to be; that man<br />\nalliance with depth psychology. stands against himself. In classiThere is something hidden in cal theology this is called in or<br />\nman\u2014the awareness of his even original sin\u2014words which<br />\nfinitude, of his being a mixture have lost their power for most<br />\npeople today.<br />\nIn classical theology this<br />\nmeans separation or estrangement from God and also froni<br />\none's own being and from one's<br />\nworld, including the other one.<br />\nIt means the human predicament contradicts its own nature.<br />\nThis is true of the individual<br />\nsituation as well as of the social<br />\nsituation.<br />\nMan is estranged from the<br />\nground of his being. He is estranged from himself and his is<br />\nestranged from \"the other one.<br />\nThis estrangement is the most<br />\ncharacteristic form of his predicament.

Occasionally, a customer may tie himself in<br />\nknots over a procedural \"stickler.\"<br />\nPeriodically, in fact, John brings<br />\nIBM customers together ... just to<br />\ntalk over what's happening in each<br />\nother's business\u2014how everybody else<br />\nhandled that old bugaboo in any<br />\nindustry... details.<br /><br />\nIntroduces new methods<br />\nDuring the two years that John<br />\nhas spent with IBM in Applied Science, he has guided innumerable IBM<br />\ncustomers to new and better ways of<br />\ndoing things electronically. For example: about a year ago, a leading<br />\naircraft manufacturer wanted to experiment with a radically different<br />\ndesign for a nuclear reactor. Although<br />\nthe basic format had been established,<br />\nthe project still required many months<br />\nof toil with mathematical equations.<br /><br />\nJohn is exercising his mathematical<br />\nknow-how in a field that was practically unheard of ten years ago. Even<br />\nnow, this kind of work may be news<br />\nto you. It was to John Jackson a few<br />\nyears back when he was an undergraduate at the University of Colorado. At that time, he was considering<br />\nactuarial work or mathematical research. But John liked the excitement<br />\nand diversification of science and industry and he wanted to use his<br /><br />\nNew field for Mathematicians<br /><br />\nDiscussing a problem with colleagues<br /><br />\nJr., 6 weeks, he enjoys his suburban<br />\nPort Washington home. He's happy<br />\nand he's satisfied. And then, too, John<br />\nknows a few vital statistics about<br />\nIBM .:. such as the fact that the<br />\nApplied Science Division has quadrupled during the past three years,<br />\nand that in 1956 alone, over 70 promotions were conferred.

MIT requires engineering<br />\nstudents to study English and History beyond the elementary level; Princeton's new president is a classics scholar,<br />\nand last spring, physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, in a<br />\nspeech at Goucher College, said \"humanities are needed to<br />\ngive direction to the multiple innovations of modern science.\"<br />\nLast month, Barry Wood, Jr., vice-president of the<br />\nHopkins Hospital, suggested humanities courses be a<br />\nrequired part of the Medical School curriculum, and<br />\nPresident Milton Eisenhower called for more funds to fill<br />\nfaculty vacancies, especially in the humanities and social<br />\nsciences. The need for humanities is being re-established.<br />\nYet at Johns Hopkins, the humanities faculty regrettably will soon lose such scholars as George Boas, Leo<br />\nSpitzer, and George Poullet. The problems raised by their<br />\nimminent retirement from the faculty are: how to get<br />\nother professors adequate to fill their particular vacancies, and how to raise a sufficient amount of money to<br />\nattract other outstanding scholars to Hopkins. Basically,<br />\nthe problems are financial.<br />\nThe attendant problem of maintaining full ranks in a<br />\nsuperior humanities faculty is that of attracting to the<br />\nundergraduate body the best students the nation's high<br />\nschool system can offer. The present freshman class<br />\ndraws only 30% of its enrollment from the top ten percent of America's high school classrooms. This statistical<br />\nmediocrity can be remedied partially through a strengthened faculty. Assuming a better calibre undergraduate student would be attracted here by an improved faculty, we<br />\nalso assume that the degree of Hopkins' academic excellence would be raised by the competition to be admitted<br />\nto the University and by the subsequently wider range<br />\nof superior students from which the admissions office<br />\ncould select freshmen. Further, both presidents Gilman<br />\nand Eisenhower said Hopkins should stand in the forefront of American education\u2014should set the standards.<br />\nThis goal is impaired by a lack of funds-with which<br />\nto form and hold together a faculty of superior research<br />\nand teaching ability\u2014a faculty that would attract with<br />\nequal drawing power outstanding students to both the<br />\nundergraduate and graduate schools.<br />\nIn light of the recent trend to stress humanities,<br />\neven in technical curricula, and in view of the imminent<br />\nretirement of several outstanding humanities scholars,<br />\nwe suggest: improve faculty salaries and thereby the University's degree of academic excellence, especially in the<br />\nhumanities, and not bother to waste money to send the<br />\nlacrosse team to England (it would suffice for the team<br />\nto win the National Championship, after 7 years).

It should be emphasized<br />\nthat a slightly lower than normal result does not by any means<br />\nindicate that such a person will<br />\nbecome a \"victim\" of pernicious<br />\nanemia. It is certain that not<br />\nall, and in fact probably only<br />\na small 'percentage, of the family members who inherit the<br />\ntendency toward this disease<br />\nactually develop the clinical disease itself.

The<br />\naccurate reporting of scientific<br />\nnews, written interestingly but<br />\nnot\u2022 sensationally, is a more and<br />\nmOre important element of public education. There has been<br />\nmuch discussion regarding the<br />\nbest way to secure this. All too<br />\nfrequently the science news to<br />\nbe read in our daily papers is<br />\nsensational in tone, stressing the<br />\n\"magical\" achievements of science, or is grossly inaccurate, so<br />\nas to leave readers with a completely erroneous impression of<br />\nthe facts. If the situation is<br />\nto be corrected, we must have<br />\nscience reporters who recognize<br />\ntheir own limitations as well as<br />\ntheir capacities, and in matters<br />\nwith which they are not entirely<br />\nfamiliar are as careful to be accurate as the scientists themselves. This means, in most<br />\ncases, that the reporter, irksome<br />\nthough he finds it, must check<br />\nhis story with his sources after<br />\nit is written. The writing of scientific news in a newspaper representing one of our great scientific research institutions ought<br />\nto set an example of good science-writing for our daily newspapers, and not the reverse.<br />\nIt is for these reasons that I<br />\ndeplore the sensational and inaccurate features of the story on<br />\nthe vitamin B,.2 experiment. I<br />\nrefer particularly to the headline, which stresses \"radioactive<br />\ninjections\" as though they were<br />\ndangerous instead of being in<br />\nthe infinitesimal amounts used<br />\nin all physiological tracer experiments; the caption under<br /><br />\nthe photograph, which actuallY<br />\nimplies that a month of listlessness might result from such an<br />\ninjection; and the two last paragraphs of the story, which miX<br />\nunfounded r um or s floating<br />\namong the students with my own<br />\nstatements in a most confusing<br />\nfashion. Let it be understood<br />\nthat I did not say that \"another<br />\npossible after-effect is feeling of<br />\nlistlessness for perhaps a month<br />\nafter the test.\" This was a baseless rumor which I tried to<br />\nscotch in no uncertain terms.<br />\nThe radio-activity of the dose<br />\ntaken is approximately .0003 r\u2014<br />\nabout the amount received froni<br />\nwearing a wristwatch with luminous dial for 3 days (not one<br />\nyear, as the story states). There<br />\nare no known aftereffects of<br />\ntaking doses of vitamin B12 111<br />\nthe amounts we used, except<br />\nbeneficial ones. In other words,<br />\nthe risk to the volunteers was<br />\nnegligible and the possible scientific rewards of such an experiment very great. Otherwise I<br />\nwould not have asked my students to participate in it, nor<br />\nhave done so myself, as I did.\"'<br />\nfeel that an injustice has been<br />\ndone to Dr. Patricia McIntYre,<br />\nDr. Julius Krevans, and to Me<br />\nfar beyond the mere misspelling<br />\nof our names. An impression has<br />\nbeen created off our own earnpus that we would condone the<br />\n\"voluntary\" subjection of our<br />\nstudents to actually dangerous<br />\nhuman experimentation.

The<br />\nColts believe that John will be a<br />\nfine addition to the staff.\"<br />\nBridgers, who had been head<br />\nfootball and track coach at Hopkins since 1953, was appointed<br />\nto the position of tackle coach of<br />\nthe pro Colts last Thursday<br />\nnight. Bridgers, who will begin<br />\nfull-time work with the Colts<br />\nnext week, has spent the past<br />\nweek coaching the Jay trackmen.<br />\nThis post will now be taken by<br />\nGeorge Brown.<br />\nSteadman, who joined the<br />\nColt organization after serving<br />\nas a sports writer for a local<br />\ndaily, acknowledged that Ewbank was attracted to Bridgers<br />\nafter speaking with him at various banquets and at the Colt<br />\ntraining sessions. \"The Colt<br />\norganization,\" stated Steadman,\"<br />\ndoes not believe that Bridgers<br />\nwill be hampered by his single<br />\nwing background. It will take<br />\nonly hard work for him to become accustomed to our style of<br />\nthe 'T'. His basic knowledge of<br />\nfootball should allow him to<br />\nmake the shift easily.\"<br />\nNo Single Wing<br />\nWhen asked if the Colts<br />\nplanned to shift to the single<br />\nwing, Steadman gasped, \"No,<br />\ndefinitely not! We will stick to<br />\nthe 'T'!\"<br />\nBridgers believes that the shift<br />\nfrom the single wing will be no<br />\nproblem at all, because \"the<br />\ntackle play in pro ball is similar<br />\nto the play of a strong side<br />\ntackle in the balanced-line single<br />\nwing formation.\"<br />\n\"The most difficult aspect of<br />\nmy new job will be the adjustment from coaching college boys<br />\nwith little or no experience to<br />\nthe coaching of professionals<br />\nwho have had from one to twelve<br />\nyears of pro experience,\" replied<br />\nBridgers to a News-Letter question.<br />\nThe new job of the former<br />\nJay coach entails year-round attention. During the off season,<br /><br />\nthe coaching staff works on the<br />\ndefenses and offenses of both<br />\nthe Colts and their opponents.<br />\nMovies are used to type team<br />\nand individual capabilities. Also,<br />\nduring this time the play-books<br />\nfor the coming season are arranged.<br />\nNew Opportunity<br />\nBridgers stated, \"I am looking forward to this new opportunity. I know that I will enjoy<br />\nmy work, and I hope to learn a<br />\nlot more about football. I hate<br />\nto leave Hopkins mainly because<br />\nof the high standing of the university and the type of boys who<br />\nattend the school.\"<br />\nWhen asked what he considered his most outstanding victory while at Hopkins, Bridgers<br />\nnamed two dates. According to<br />\nBridgers, his most surprising victory came in 1955 when the Jays<br />\nMaryland,<br />\nWestern<br />\ntrounced<br />\n33-0, to end a diSmal season on<br />\na happy note. The victory that<br />\ngave the new Colt coach the<br />\nmost satisfaction was the 1956<br />\nvictory over the Terrors. Bridgers said, \"The 1956 victory accomplished so many things that<br />\nwe had been trying to do for so<br />\nlong.\"<br />\nPotential Champs<br />\nThe former Jay coach urged<br />\nany boy to go out for the Hopkins football team, because a<br />\ngreat deal can be gained from<br />\nfootball.\" Next year's team,<br />\nadded Bridgers, \"though not as<br />\nlast<br />\nyear's<br />\nexperienced<br />\nas<br />\nchampions has the size and potential to improve last year's<br />\nrecord. Many thing, however,<br />\ncould alter this situation.\"<br />\nBridgers was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and attended<br />\nRamsay High School, where he<br />\nlettered in football and baseball.<br />\nHe attended Auburn where he<br />\nagain lettered in football. Bridgers served in the Army from<br />\n1943 to 1946, during which time<br />\nhe not only rose to the rank of<br />\ncaptain, but also coached football, track, and baseball. After<br />\nthe war, he returned to Auburn<br />\nand received a degree in economics and business administration. In 1946 Bridgers served<br />\nthe dual role of football coach<br />\nof the \"B\" team and economics<br />\ninstructor at Auburn. In the fall<br /><br />\nof 1947 he moved to Sewanee as<br />\nassistant football coach and head<br />\ntrack coach. His six year stay<br />\nthere was interrupted by a one<br />\nyear tour of duty in Japan where<br />\nhe again coached football for<br />\nthe Army. In July, 1953, Bridgers became head football and<br />\ntrack coach at Hopkins.<br />\nBridgers said, \"In my four<br />\nyears at Hopkins I have learned<br />\nmore football than in my eight<br />\nprevious years in coaching.<br />\nPrior to coming to Hopkins I<br />\nhad only one unvictorious season.\"<br />\n\"No Comment\"<br />\nWhen asked if there was anything about the Hopkins athletic situation that he would like<br />\nto see changed, Bridgers declined<br />\ncomment saying that it would<br />\ndo no good to enumerate the<br />\n4.<br />\nfaults of ,the system.<br />\nBridgers stated his appreciation for all the cooperation given<br />\nto him by the News-Letter.<br /><br />\nFrosh Trackmen<br />\nPlease Bridgers<br />\nThrough Turnout<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nAfter su-rveying the turnout of<br />\n30 hopefuls for the Frosh track<br />\nJohn Bridgers is shown in one of the happier moments of<br />\nteam, Coach John Bridgers re- his four-year stay at Hopkins.
