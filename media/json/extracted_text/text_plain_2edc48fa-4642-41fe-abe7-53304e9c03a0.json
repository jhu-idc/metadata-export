This' is a result of the<br />\nlaxity of members of the<br />\ncommunity, including faculty, to<br />\nreport other students to the<br />\nCommission, as well as increased<br />\ncompetition among students.<br />\nThe adoption of more severe<br />\npenalties this semester - suspension<br />\nfrom the University for a first<br />\nconviction, and expulsion for a<br />\nsecond - were designed to act as a<br />\nclet ccertt<br />\nwhich students were asked to vote<br />\n<br />\nfor our against the new penalties.<br />\nThe Student Council maintains<br />\nthat the penalties are supported by<br />\nthe Student Body.<br />\nThe Honor Commission is that<br />\ngroup charged with maintaining<br />\nthe ideals of the Honor System.<br />\nThe Commission conducts trials in<br />\nall reported cases of suspected<br />\ncheating on examinations. Last<br />\nyear the make-up of the Honor<br />\nCommission was changed from a<br />\nself-perpetuating body to one<br />\nelected by students. Also, the size<br />\nof the Commission was changed<br />\nfrom twenty-two to sixteen<br />\nmembers. This was done to make<br />\nthe Commission, more responsible<br />\nto the students. It is also important<br />\nto be aware .that Honor System<br />\ntrials are trials of inquiry - to<br />\ndetermine what the facts are and if<br />\na violation of the Honor System<br />\nhas taken place - and not trials of<br />\naccusation.<br />\nThe alternatives to the Honor<br />\nSystem is a proctored examination<br />\nsystem, a system based on distrust.<br />\nAs the Honor System is now on a<br />\nquasi-probationary basis, it is<br />\nimportant for studenis___to_ choose_<br />\nbetween these systems.

In spite<br />\nof this problem the Blue Jays<br />\nfound the way to the scoreboard<br />\nfirst.<br />\nBefore the second quarter was<br />\ntwo minutes old, Thomas<br />\nconverted a third and fourteen<br />\nplay at his own 26 with a twenty<br />\nyard pass over the middle to<br />\nsenior Bill Nolan. The crafty<br />\nlittle receiver then proceeded to<br />\nevade his defender, break two<br />\nattempted tackles and ramble<br />\ndown the sideline to the ten,<br />\nwhere he was finally caught from<br />\nbehind. The ball squirted loose as<br />\nhe was brought down, but<br />\nHopkins recovered eight yards<br />\ncloser to the goal, culminating a<br />\n72 yard play.<br />\nOn the next snap, Thomas hit<br />\nfreshman tight end Scott Smith<br />\nin the endzone to give the Blue<br />\nJays a 6-0 lead. The score held up<br />\nuntil the last moments of the<br />\n<br />\nhalf, when Dickinson stole a<br />\nThomas toss at the Blue Jay 32.<br />\nSix plays later, as the clock ran<br />\nout, the Red Devils came up with<br />\na 3 yard scoring pass to take a<br />\n7-6 half-time lead. Dickinson<br />\nburned the defense this time. but<br />\nthe Blue Jays reacted by shutting<br />\nout the hosts the rest of the<br />\ngame, letting them inside the<br />\nforty only once more. The<br />\nHopkins defense has now given<br />\nup a single touchdown in eight<br />\nquarters of football competition.<br />\nAfter the break, improved<br />\nexecution and some strategic<br />\nadjustments turned the tide to<br />\nthe Blue jay favor. \"Dickinson<br />\nchanged their defense for us,\"<br />\nexplained Coach Cox. \"Once<br />\nagain we went to the inside when<br />\nour wide game was shut off.\"<br />\nOn the first Hopkins<br />\npossession of the third period,<br />\nco-captain Thomas engineered a<br />\ntime consuming thirteen play<br />\ndrive he ended with a\u2022 one yard<br />\nplunge into paydirt. The score<br />\nput the Blue Jays ahead for good,<br />\nbut several defensive gems<br />\ninsured the outcome.<br />\nDuring the third quarter,<br />\nHopkins did not allow a first<br />\ndown, forcing the Red Devils to<br />\npunt from insire their own thirty<br />\nall three times they had the ball.<br />\nThe final Hopkins score was<br />\nset up on a pressured punt in the<br />\nlast stanza. Partially blocked, the<br />\nRed Devil kick travelled thirteen<br />\nyards to the Blue Jay 32. Three<br />\nTed Stefaniw rushes moved<br />\nHopkins to the five, where<br />\nThomas faked the handoff to the<br />\nsophomore fullback, turned and<br />\nlofted an aerial to a wide open<br />\nScott Smith for his fourth<br />\ntouchdown reception in three<br />\ngames.<br />\nDickinson tried to rally in the<br />\ntime remaining, but the defense<br />\nstood firm.

With his own net<br />\ntender out of position, a Widener<br />\ndefenseman decided to take up<br />\nthe slack and blocked the<br />\nwould-be goal at the goal line<br />\nwith his hand. Sophomore Joe<br />\n\"The Rocket\" Rutkowski took<br />\nthe free kick and drilled it into<br />\nthe lower right hand corner of<br />\nthe net, allowing the goalie no<br />\npossible chance to stop it.<br />\nThe second goal,came when<br />\nArguero, using some unknown<br />\nspeed and ability which must be<br />\nattributed to Coach Bob Oliver's<br />\n\"shoot and chase\" drill, dribbled<br />\nthe ball doWnfield with his<br />\ndefenseman on his tail. Bert drew<br />\nthe Widener goalie out of the net,<br />\nproceeded to dribble around him<br />\nand then shot the ball between<br />\nthe legs of his defender and into<br />\nthe net.<br />\nThe Widener goal came on a<br />\ncorner kick which went into the<br />\nnet with the help of a strong<br />\ndeceiving wind that carried the<br />\nball away from the outstretched<br />\nhands of Hopkins goalie Keith<br />\nNaunheim.<br />\nIn the second half, brilliant<br />\ngoaltending play by Naunheim<br />\npreserved the victory. In one<br />\n<br />\nFreshman linemate Hetherington<br />\nadded two quarterback sacks to<br />\nhis six tackles and eight aided<br />\nstops. Maimone, alv a first year<br />\nMan, contributed eleven tackles<br />\nfrom his linebacking position to<br />\nwin backfield honors.<br />\n<br />\nparticularly stunning sequence he<br />\ncame out of the net to make a<br />\nfantastic save, diving at the foot<br />\nof 4 Widener attackman who<br />\nattempted a shot. The ball<br />\nricochetted off Naunheim's body<br />\nonto the foot of another Widener<br />\nplayer. The Hopkins co-captain<br />\nscrambled to his knees to make a<br />\n<br />\ndiving stop of the rebound<br />\nattempt.<br />\nAs the game continued<br />\nthrough the second half, play was<br />\nmostly contained on the Hopkins<br />\noffensive side of the field.

He's not an athlete.<br />\nSimon still has his baby fat and he<br />\nconstantly wears thick<br />\nblack-framed glasses. But in high<br />\nschool he was treasurer of the<br />\nDebate Club and he earned a high<br />\ncumulative grade average. Simon<br />\nlearns quickly that college is even<br />\nharder than high school. He no<br />\nlonger has any time to \"get<br />\ninvolved\" and join the Debate<br />\nClub. He leaves his apartment only<br />\nto shop or go to class. It takes a lot<br /><br />\nof studying to become a doctor.<br />\nOccasionally for relaxation,<br />\nSimon plays with his Organic<br />\nChemistry tinker toys.

The class meets three<br />\ntimes a week in one of those<br />\nlecture halls where the rows of<br />\ndesks are steeped up to the ceiling<br />\nin a sharp incline.

For the<br />\nHonor System to work it must<br />\nhave the support of the<br />\ncommunity, students and faculty<br />\nalike; without this support the<br />\nSystem cannot function as it<br />\nshould. Each student is responsible<br />\nfor actively participating in the<br />\nSystem, by living honorably in it,<br />\nand by insuring that the<br />\ncommunityis.m6t..injured by those<br />\nwho do not abide by the System.<br />\nTo prevent injury to the entire<br />\n.community, everyone, students<br />\nand faculty, has the responsibility<br />\nto the Honor Commission via Box<br />\n1280, any individual suspected of<br />\ncheating on any examination.<br />\nThe failure of the Honor System<br /><br />\nto work will be due to its abuse by<br />\nundergraduates. There is evidence<br />\nthat the System is being<br />\nincreasingly abused, as individuals<br />\ncome to feel they can take<br />\nadvantage of the System by<br />\ncheating.

Also, the size<br />\nof the Commission was changed<br />\nfrom twenty-two to sixteen<br />\nmembers. This was done to make<br />\nthe Commission, more responsible<br />\nto the students. It is also important<br />\nto be aware .that Honor System<br />\ntrials are trials of inquiry - to<br />\ndetermine what the facts are and if<br />\na violation of the Honor System<br />\nhas taken place - and not trials of<br />\naccusation.<br />\nThe alternatives to the Honor<br />\nSystem is a proctored examination<br />\nsystem, a system based on distrust.<br />\nAs the Honor System is now on a<br />\nquasi-probationary basis, it is<br />\nimportant for studenis___to_ choose_<br />\nbetween these systems.
