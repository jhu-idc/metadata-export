The<br />\nfact, so far has our ignorance of<br />\nwhat transpires in one of the most<br />\nimportant of the original research<br />\ndepartments at Johns Hopkins gone,<br />\nthat the appearance of an article in<br />\nthe February Century, entitled \"A<br />\nNew Department in Photography,\"<br />\nhas come entirely unexpected and<br />\nunheralded. The demonstrations and<br />\nexperiments with \"invisible light\"<br />\nappeal to others than physicists or<br />\nProfessor<br />\nindeed<br />\nphotographers,<br />\nWood has gone far towards putting<br />\non a scientific basis the old adage<br />\nthat \"things are not always what<br />\nthey seem.\"<br />\nWe are all familiar with the old<br />\nexperiment of the passage of a ray<br />\nof light through a prism, and we<br />\nall know that the spectrum thus<br />\nfound shows a rainbow-like band of<br />\ncolors which is bordered on one side<br />\nby red and on the other side by violet, but that there are other colors,<br />\nor rays, beyond the red and beyond<br />\nthe violet, and which cannot be seen<br />\nunder ordinary conditions, has only<br />\nbeen discarded in comparatively recent times. Although these colors<br />\nare not visible to the human eye, on<br />\naccount of the light-ray -being too<br />\nlong or too short to be recorded, they<br />\ncan be detected by projecting the<br />\n<br />\nspectrum on a sensitive photographic<br />\nplate in a darkened room. The light<br />\nregistered on the plate next to the<br />\nviolet of the spectrum is called ultraviolet, that next to the red infrared. It is of co-..rse impossible to<br />\npresent all the examples and experiments as set forth by Professor<br />\nWood, but in the accompanying picture some idea of the effect of the<br />\nultra-violet light in photography may<br />\ni)e gained.

Speaking for myself I<br />\ndo not find this true. On the contrary, as time goes on and experience is gained I feel more anxious<br />\nthat the University shall continue to<br />\nbe what it was while I was in Baltimore, in 1877-1878--a place for hard<br />\nwork, plain living and high thinking.<br />\nI am one of those who have formed strong interests elsewhere, but I<br />\nhave congratulated myself that I had<br />\nbecame associated with the Johns<br />\nHopkins University and all that it<br />\nstands for in scholarship. This attachment is like other strong emotions. One does not talk about them,<br />\nbut they are felt the more strongly.<br />\nIf the management takes the pains to<br />\nsee to it that the busy doctors of philosophy know of university needs<br />\nthey will not find us deficient in interest.<br />\nEdward Hart.<br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nIn reading the News-Letter today,<br />\nI note with interest what is being<br />\nsaid in reference to the Honor System. While at college we took up<br />\nthis proposition,and after a very close<br />\nfight decided that at that time the<br />\nplan was not feasible.<br />\nWith certain objections you are<br />\nno doubt familiar. First that of reporting men whether they are<br />\nfriends, enemies, or mere acquaintances, and this furthermore, promotes<br />\nfeeling, if one should exist between<br />\nmen not on good terms with one another. Another point is that, suppose a man who is in his last term<br />\nfor his degree, whose future work<br />\ndepends on his degree, cheats in<br />\nsome manner, is convicted and expelled from college, the question<br />\ncomes to my mind have we the right<br />\nto turn him away, to deprive him of<br />\nhis degree, his means of a livelihood?<br />\nI doubt it exceedingly.<br />\nOn the \u2018other hand, in many re-<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\nspects I think it a fine idea, and in<br />\nmany instances has worked to perfection. It undoubtly advances the<br />\nmoral tone of the student, reduces<br />\nthe amount of underhand work, and<br />\nobliterates the spying professor, who<br />\nhas his likes and dislikes. The Honor System is much better adapted to<br />\na college with dormitories than to<br />\none situated in a large city with students living at home or in boarding<br />\nhouses. It is a big step to take, and<br />\nshould have full considertion before<br />\naction is finally taken.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nAlumnus.<br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter:<br />\nMay I give my reasons for opposing the ;,,,doption in the Johns Hopkins University of the so-called\"Hon<br />\nor System,\" which several of your<br />\ncorrespondents have advocated?<br />\nSurely, when we reflect a moment,<br />\nwe shall see that the present method<br />\nof conducting examinations is much<br />\nmore of an honor system than the<br />\nsystem used in some other institutions, and advocated by your correspondents. At present the student has<br />\nsimply his own will to keep him from<br />\ndishonesty in his examinations. There<br />\nare, to be sure, professors in the<br />\nroom; but they show us clearly that<br />\nthey are not there to watch us. Witn<br />\nthe introduction of this new system,<br />\nthe student has not only his own will,<br />\nbut the fear of the penalty to keep<br />\nhim from dishonesty. So the question resolves itself: Is it better that<br />\na student be given a chance to control his own will, with his own conscience as a judge, or that he be<br />\nforced, by fear, to do right. The<br />\none method gives the student the opportunity to strengthen his will-power or to weaken it; the other method<br />\ntakes away this opportunity, and allows him neither to strengthen nor<br />\nweaken it. Which is the better? The<br />\nanswer to this question depends upon<br />\nwhether the proportion of students<br />\nwho strengthen themselves is greater<br />\nor less than that of those who weaken themselves. From the observations that I have made, I believe that<br />\nat least ninety per cent of the students are perfectly honest in their<br />\nexaminations. It hardly seems fair<br />\nthat this vast majority should have<br />\ntheir opportunity for development restricted by the comparatively small<br />\nnumber who must be forced to do<br />\nright.<br />\nStudent.<br />\nIn addition to those whose terms<br />\nexpire in 1910 the following alumni<br />\nhave been placed in nomination for<br />\nthe years 1910-1914.

The demonstrations and<br />\nexperiments with \"invisible light\"<br />\nappeal to others than physicists or<br />\nProfessor<br />\nindeed<br />\nphotographers,<br />\nWood has gone far towards putting<br />\non a scientific basis the old adage<br />\nthat \"things are not always what<br />\nthey seem.\"<br />\nWe are all familiar with the old<br />\nexperiment of the passage of a ray<br />\nof light through a prism, and we<br />\nall know that the spectrum thus<br />\nfound shows a rainbow-like band of<br />\ncolors which is bordered on one side<br />\nby red and on the other side by violet, but that there are other colors,<br />\nor rays, beyond the red and beyond<br />\nthe violet, and which cannot be seen<br />\nunder ordinary conditions, has only<br />\nbeen discarded in comparatively recent times. Although these colors<br />\nare not visible to the human eye, on<br />\naccount of the light-ray -being too<br />\nlong or too short to be recorded, they<br />\ncan be detected by projecting the<br /><br />\nspectrum on a sensitive photographic<br />\nplate in a darkened room. The light<br />\nregistered on the plate next to the<br />\nviolet of the spectrum is called ultraviolet, that next to the red infrared.

Speaking for myself I<br />\ndo not find this true. On the contrary, as time goes on and experience is gained I feel more anxious<br />\nthat the University shall continue to<br />\nbe what it was while I was in Baltimore, in 1877-1878--a place for hard<br />\nwork, plain living and high thinking.<br />\nI am one of those who have formed strong interests elsewhere, but I<br />\nhave congratulated myself that I had<br />\nbecame associated with the Johns<br />\nHopkins University and all that it<br />\nstands for in scholarship. This attachment is like other strong emotions. One does not talk about them,<br />\nbut they are felt the more strongly.<br />\nIf the management takes the pains to<br />\nsee to it that the busy doctors of philosophy know of university needs<br />\nthey will not find us deficient in interest.<br />\nEdward Hart.<br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter,<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nIn reading the News-Letter today,<br />\nI note with interest what is being<br />\nsaid in reference to the Honor System. While at college we took up<br />\nthis proposition,and after a very close<br />\nfight decided that at that time the<br />\nplan was not feasible.<br />\nWith certain objections you are<br />\nno doubt familiar. First that of reporting men whether they are<br />\nfriends, enemies, or mere acquaintances, and this furthermore, promotes<br />\nfeeling, if one should exist between<br />\nmen not on good terms with one another. Another point is that, suppose a man who is in his last term<br />\nfor his degree, whose future work<br />\ndepends on his degree, cheats in<br />\nsome manner, is convicted and expelled from college, the question<br />\ncomes to my mind have we the right<br />\nto turn him away, to deprive him of<br />\nhis degree, his means of a livelihood?<br />\nI doubt it exceedingly.<br />\nOn the \u2018other hand, in many re-<br /><br />\n5<br />\nspects I think it a fine idea, and in<br />\nmany instances has worked to perfection. It undoubtly advances the<br />\nmoral tone of the student, reduces<br />\nthe amount of underhand work, and<br />\nobliterates the spying professor, who<br />\nhas his likes and dislikes. The Honor System is much better adapted to<br />\na college with dormitories than to<br />\none situated in a large city with students living at home or in boarding<br />\nhouses. It is a big step to take, and<br />\nshould have full considertion before<br />\naction is finally taken.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nAlumnus.<br />\nTo the Editor of The News-Letter:<br />\nMay I give my reasons for opposing the ;,,,doption in the Johns Hopkins University of the so-called\"Hon<br />\nor System,\" which several of your<br />\ncorrespondents have advocated?<br />\nSurely, when we reflect a moment,<br />\nwe shall see that the present method<br />\nof conducting examinations is much<br />\nmore of an honor system than the<br />\nsystem used in some other institutions, and advocated by your correspondents. At present the student has<br />\nsimply his own will to keep him from<br />\ndishonesty in his examinations. There<br />\nare, to be sure, professors in the<br />\nroom; but they show us clearly that<br />\nthey are not there to watch us. Witn<br />\nthe introduction of this new system,<br />\nthe student has not only his own will,<br />\nbut the fear of the penalty to keep<br />\nhim from dishonesty. So the question resolves itself: Is it better that<br />\na student be given a chance to control his own will, with his own conscience as a judge, or that he be<br />\nforced, by fear, to do right. The<br />\none method gives the student the opportunity to strengthen his will-power or to weaken it; the other method<br />\ntakes away this opportunity, and allows him neither to strengthen nor<br />\nweaken it. Which is the better? The<br />\nanswer to this question depends upon<br />\nwhether the proportion of students<br />\nwho strengthen themselves is greater<br />\nor less than that of those who weaken themselves. From the observations that I have made, I believe that<br />\nat least ninety per cent of the students are perfectly honest in their<br />\nexaminations. It hardly seems fair<br />\nthat this vast majority should have<br />\ntheir opportunity for development restricted by the comparatively small<br />\nnumber who must be forced to do<br />\nright.<br />\nStudent.<br />\nIn addition to those whose terms<br />\nexpire in 1910 the following alumni<br />\nhave been placed in nomination for<br />\nthe years 1910-1914.
