The small<br />\nHopkins goalie seemed to cover<br />\nthe whole mouth of the net, as well<br />\naimed shots rolled off his arfns, his<br />\nlegs, his chest, and even his head,<br />\nwhile the husky Middy net guardian's swift moving stick seemed to<br />\nhave stretched until it formed a net<br />\nin front of Navy's goal.<br />\nThe whole outcome of the great<br />\nstruggle hinged on which of the<br />\ntwo hard-hitting offense machines<br />\ncould first break the opposing defense. Finally, the smooth running<br />\nHopkins machine broke through<br />\nwhen Biddison \"goosed\" the ball<br />\nfrom the bottom of the piled up<br />\nNavy defense past the falling Middy goal keeper after ten minutes of<br />\nhard maneuvers.<br />\nFarinholt Scores<br />\n<br />\nmake the men work hard to retain<br />\n<br />\nOnce having broken through the<br />\ntight Navy defense line, the Hopkins attack gradually gained impetus, as fed by Lang and Biddison, their well-aimed shots began to<br />\ntake effect. Farinholt was the second of the Jay attackers to tally<br />\nwhen he sent a long shot through<br />\nthe entire Middy defense.<br />\nMeanwhile the Middy attackers<br />\nwere not idle. Led by Hull, their<br />\nsmall but agile inhome, they continued their incessant fire upon the<br />\nwary Finn, until Gardner Mallonee<br />\nand his goal defenders were able to<br />\nform a hole-proof line around the<br />\nJay's net.

HILL, '29<br />\nWILLIAM S. PIKE, '29<br />\nMember Southern Intercollegiate Newspaper Association<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br />\n<br />\nA COMPLAINT<br />\nThough the Maryland Free State is recognized as the center<br />\nof lacrosse interest in the United States, it is unfortunate indeed<br />\nthat the good old game is not accorded more recognition in other<br />\nstates than we think it deserves. For example, the eminent New<br />\nYork Times, a paper which advertises that it covers completely<br />\nall important events in the sport world, not only failed to report'<br />\nthe Hopkins-Navy game, but did not contain one lacrosse writeup in its Sunday edition.<br />\nPerhaps the sports editor of the Times might not consider<br />\ncollege<br />\ngame attended by seven thousand spectators an impora<br />\ntant sporting event, but we doubt even that. We can only wonder<br />\nwhy the news of the game was omitted.<br />\n<br />\nNOTE ON LAST WEEK'S TRIAL<br />\nIt is almost inevitable that the honor system should break<br />\ndown on occasion. Until Hopkins becomes transformed into<br />\nUtopia, we can do nothing more than hope for a close approach<br />\nto perfection. And as we have said in these columns before, we.<br />\nbelieve that the system at this University works as well as human<br />\nbeings will let it.<br />\nTherefore, when such an unfortunate occurrence as was experienced last week is brought to light, some of the chronic worriers on the campus begin to fear for the souls of their comrades and to foresee all sorts of calamitous breaches of honor.<br />\nOthers, on the other hand, have said that they believed that the<br />\nmen who were dismissed from the University were treated harshly<br />\nand stigmatized for the remainder of their lives. Neither of these<br />\njudgments is accurate to a great degree. The fact that these men<br />\nwere able to be disciplined is a salutary one rather than a deplorable one. As regards the treatment that the, men received, the<br />\nfacts peculiar to their case warrant and justify the procedure of<br />\nthe Student Council. Let us hope that the Council's action will<br />\nstand as a warning to malefactors that it means business.<br />\n<br />\nYES and NO<br />\nWhy is there such a hub-bub about the ways and morals of<br />\nthe younger generation? Is it simply the age-old tendency of<br />\nold age\u2014always to find the kids different from those of twenty<br />\nyears ago? Of course, we are different; our ways and our morals<br />\n\u2014if we have such things\u2014are not like those of our fathers, and<br />\nshould not be judged by the same standards. Our elders unreasonably apply the inquisitory methods of their own days to our shocking behavior; naturally the result horrifies them. If some energetic<br />\nand didactic young journalist could compose a set of rules based on<br />\nthe few dogmas, commandments, and rules of society which this<br />\nyounger degeneration still respects, our manners might not seem<br />\nso completely immoral.<br />\nIs it youth that sins? Few of us know just exactly what sin<br />\nis; that, thank God, is one of our prize deficiencies; but is it youth<br />\nthat gets its lecherous and debauched countenance smeared all over<br />\nthe tabloids? Think a moment, proud parents. Which generation<br />\ncan claim the Reverend Dr. Hall and his murdered play-mate?<br />\nWith which group do \"Flaming Ruth,\" as Mr. Hearst jokingly<br />\ncalls her, and her aristocratic corset-vendor fall? The Snyder<br />\nmurderers sinned no sin of which even the wickedest of us youngsters would boast; their, greatest offense was stupidity, which<br />\nis rather a vice of middle-age.<br />\nSome broad-minded Bishop\u2014I insist on the veracity of such<br />\nseeming<br />\na<br />\nparadox\u2014recently denied that to-day's youth differed<br />\ngreatly from that of his seminary years;\u2014a statement as offensive<br />\nas that which accuses us of having no morals at all. Even here,<br />\nwhere education is of tantamount importance, there are those\u2014I<br />\nblush to say it\u2014who have admitted sipping a little too much potent<br />\nliquid. Yea; even at Hopkins where we have an Honor System<br />\nand a Student Council, there is vice; there are those who indulge<br />\nin \"promiscuous petting\"\u2014who coined that lovely phrase, anyhow? The old man tells me\u2014as everyone else's old man tells<br />\neveryone else\u2014that in his day a girl who danced with a man<br />\nwho smelled even faintly alcoholic was not long on the better invitation lists. He tells me that he was never profane before<br />\nladies; who is not, nowadays? And there are other strange things<br />\nhe tells me. . .<br />\nHopkins does its best to be modern, and almost succeeds. Almost all of the sins in the revised list have been committed here--almost. We are strikingly deficient in one respect: we have never<br />\nhad a suicide. Being ignorant of the proper persons to whom to<br />\nrefer this oversight, I timidly suggest that the faculty award a<br />\nsilver cup to the student dying the most artistic death; that some<br />\npotential Ph. D. write a thesis, in imitation of De Quincey, \"On<br />\nSuicide as a Fine Art\", and that all R. 0. T. C. officers hang<br />\nthemselves on the Gilman Hall porticoes.<br />\nBut let us consider the matter logically, as we should have<br />\ndone to begin with, journalists, psychologists and ministers of<br />\nthe Gospel view the so-called suicide epidemic with something<br />\nsuspiciously akin to indignation. Why? It is most natural that<br />\nwith the increasing leisure granted to young men by the comfortable financial states of their fathers, there should ensue an increasing unhappiness. Your contented cow of a man is not he<br />\nwho has ample opportunity to ponder on the uselessness of life;<br />\nthe George Babbitt of society has no use for suicide, because continuous hard work has not allowed him time for dissatisfaction.<br />\nHappiness and stupidity are equally the effects of hard work and<br />\nconsequent unthinkingness. Melancholy, temperament, artistry,<br />\nand above all, romantic outlook, result from idleness. Then who<br />\nhas more right to such qualities than the student? Further, it is<br />\naccepted fact that youth has a greater emotional range, a finer<br />\ncapacity for heights of joy and depths of despondency, than. any<br />\nother age. Obviously suicide is a romantic pastime; something<br />\nyour busy and contented man does not indulge in.<br />\nIf suicide, then, is natural to any class, or if it is even the<br />\nright of any class, it is not at all remarkable that American universities should feel the effects of the vaunted American prosperity. Most of our sins, or whatever you wish to call them, are<br />\npetty and ignoble; our greatest virtue is a lack of ideals. If some<br />\nof the weaker members see life too clearly, and do not care to<br />\ncontinue in it, it is their right to leave when they please, and<br />\nno one need wonder nor object.<br />\n<br />\nWhat He's<br />\nLooking For<br />\nWhether its pattern\u2014or sturdy<br />\nwear\u2014or price\u2014or<br />\nall three\u2014whether<br />\nfor formal wear or<br />\nbusi ness.

PIKE, '29<br />\nMember Southern Intercollegiate Newspaper Association<br />\nPrinted by The Read-Taylor Press, South and Lombard Streets<br /><br />\nA COMPLAINT<br />\nThough the Maryland Free State is recognized as the center<br />\nof lacrosse interest in the United States, it is unfortunate indeed<br />\nthat the good old game is not accorded more recognition in other<br />\nstates than we think it deserves. For example, the eminent New<br />\nYork Times, a paper which advertises that it covers completely<br />\nall important events in the sport world, not only failed to report'<br />\nthe Hopkins-Navy game, but did not contain one lacrosse writeup in its Sunday edition.<br />\nPerhaps the sports editor of the Times might not consider<br />\ncollege<br />\ngame attended by seven thousand spectators an impora<br />\ntant sporting event, but we doubt even that. We can only wonder<br />\nwhy the news of the game was omitted.<br /><br />\nNOTE ON LAST WEEK'S TRIAL<br />\nIt is almost inevitable that the honor system should break<br />\ndown on occasion. Until Hopkins becomes transformed into<br />\nUtopia, we can do nothing more than hope for a close approach<br />\nto perfection. And as we have said in these columns before, we.<br />\nbelieve that the system at this University works as well as human<br />\nbeings will let it.<br />\nTherefore, when such an unfortunate occurrence as was experienced last week is brought to light, some of the chronic worriers on the campus begin to fear for the souls of their comrades and to foresee all sorts of calamitous breaches of honor.<br />\nOthers, on the other hand, have said that they believed that the<br />\nmen who were dismissed from the University were treated harshly<br />\nand stigmatized for the remainder of their lives. Neither of these<br />\njudgments is accurate to a great degree. The fact that these men<br />\nwere able to be disciplined is a salutary one rather than a deplorable one. As regards the treatment that the, men received, the<br />\nfacts peculiar to their case warrant and justify the procedure of<br />\nthe Student Council. Let us hope that the Council's action will<br />\nstand as a warning to malefactors that it means business.<br /><br />\nYES and NO<br />\nWhy is there such a hub-bub about the ways and morals of<br />\nthe younger generation? Is it simply the age-old tendency of<br />\nold age\u2014always to find the kids different from those of twenty<br />\nyears ago? Of course, we are different; our ways and our morals<br />\n\u2014if we have such things\u2014are not like those of our fathers, and<br />\nshould not be judged by the same standards. Our elders unreasonably apply the inquisitory methods of their own days to our shocking behavior; naturally the result horrifies them. If some energetic<br />\nand didactic young journalist could compose a set of rules based on<br />\nthe few dogmas, commandments, and rules of society which this<br />\nyounger degeneration still respects, our manners might not seem<br />\nso completely immoral.<br />\nIs it youth that sins? Few of us know just exactly what sin<br />\nis; that, thank God, is one of our prize deficiencies; but is it youth<br />\nthat gets its lecherous and debauched countenance smeared all over<br />\nthe tabloids? Think a moment, proud parents. Which generation<br />\ncan claim the Reverend Dr. Hall and his murdered play-mate?<br />\nWith which group do \"Flaming Ruth,\" as Mr. Hearst jokingly<br />\ncalls her, and her aristocratic corset-vendor fall? The Snyder<br />\nmurderers sinned no sin of which even the wickedest of us youngsters would boast; their, greatest offense was stupidity, which<br />\nis rather a vice of middle-age.<br />\nSome broad-minded Bishop\u2014I insist on the veracity of such<br />\nseeming<br />\na<br />\nparadox\u2014recently denied that to-day's youth differed<br />\ngreatly from that of his seminary years;\u2014a statement as offensive<br />\nas that which accuses us of having no morals at all. Even here,<br />\nwhere education is of tantamount importance, there are those\u2014I<br />\nblush to say it\u2014who have admitted sipping a little too much potent<br />\nliquid. Yea; even at Hopkins where we have an Honor System<br />\nand a Student Council, there is vice; there are those who indulge<br />\nin \"promiscuous petting\"\u2014who coined that lovely phrase, anyhow? The old man tells me\u2014as everyone else's old man tells<br />\neveryone else\u2014that in his day a girl who danced with a man<br />\nwho smelled even faintly alcoholic was not long on the better invitation lists. He tells me that he was never profane before<br />\nladies; who is not, nowadays? And there are other strange things<br />\nhe tells me. . .<br />\nHopkins does its best to be modern, and almost succeeds. Almost all of the sins in the revised list have been committed here--almost. We are strikingly deficient in one respect: we have never<br />\nhad a suicide. Being ignorant of the proper persons to whom to<br />\nrefer this oversight, I timidly suggest that the faculty award a<br />\nsilver cup to the student dying the most artistic death; that some<br />\npotential Ph. D. write a thesis, in imitation of De Quincey, \"On<br />\nSuicide as a Fine Art\", and that all R. 0. T. C. officers hang<br />\nthemselves on the Gilman Hall porticoes.<br />\nBut let us consider the matter logically, as we should have<br />\ndone to begin with, journalists, psychologists and ministers of<br />\nthe Gospel view the so-called suicide epidemic with something<br />\nsuspiciously akin to indignation. Why? It is most natural that<br />\nwith the increasing leisure granted to young men by the comfortable financial states of their fathers, there should ensue an increasing unhappiness. Your contented cow of a man is not he<br />\nwho has ample opportunity to ponder on the uselessness of life;<br />\nthe George Babbitt of society has no use for suicide, because continuous hard work has not allowed him time for dissatisfaction.<br />\nHappiness and stupidity are equally the effects of hard work and<br />\nconsequent unthinkingness. Melancholy, temperament, artistry,<br />\nand above all, romantic outlook, result from idleness. Then who<br />\nhas more right to such qualities than the student? Further, it is<br />\naccepted fact that youth has a greater emotional range, a finer<br />\ncapacity for heights of joy and depths of despondency, than. any<br />\nother age. Obviously suicide is a romantic pastime; something<br />\nyour busy and contented man does not indulge in.<br />\nIf suicide, then, is natural to any class, or if it is even the<br />\nright of any class, it is not at all remarkable that American universities should feel the effects of the vaunted American prosperity. Most of our sins, or whatever you wish to call them, are<br />\npetty and ignoble; our greatest virtue is a lack of ideals. If some<br />\nof the weaker members see life too clearly, and do not care to<br />\ncontinue in it, it is their right to leave when they please, and<br />\nno one need wonder nor object.<br /><br />\nWhat He's<br />\nLooking For<br />\nWhether its pattern\u2014or sturdy<br />\nwear\u2014or price\u2014or<br />\nall three\u2014whether<br />\nfor formal wear or<br />\nbusi ness.
