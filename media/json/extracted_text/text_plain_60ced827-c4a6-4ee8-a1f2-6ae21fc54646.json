Reprinted<br />\nwith permission.<br />\nBy GILBERT FUCHSBERG<br />\n<br />\nBy several measures of financial success, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity appears to be doing<br />\nquite well. It reported a<br />\n$16-million surplus last year, has<br />\nraised more than $512-million in<br />\nprivate donations since 1984, and<br />\nranks first among universities in<br />\nfederal research support, with<br />\nnearly $500-million in grants and<br />\ncontracts.<br />\nNonetheless, Hopkins officials<br />\nrecently announced a plan to cut<br />\n10 per cent of the arts-andsciences faculty, increase<br />\nundergraduate enrollment and tuition, and delay indefinitely<br />\nseveral major building projects<br />\nand academic ventures.<br />\nMany people might wonder: If<br />\nthe university appears to be flush<br />\nwith cash, why is it taking such<br />\ndramatic action to cut costs and<br />\nincrease revenues?<br />\nThe answer lies in the way in<br />\nwhich Johns Hopkins manages its<br />\ndivisions. While most universities<br />\ncontrol their finances centrally,<br />\nroutinely using surpluses from<br />\none division to cover another's<br />\nlosses, Hopkins demands of its<br />\ndivisions an unusual degree of<br />\nself-sufficiency.<br />\nEven though some divisions<br />\nmay show profits, and even<br />\n<br />\nthough the university as a whole<br />\nmay take in more money than it<br />\nspends, any division that does not<br />\nat least break even must cut its<br />\ncosts and look for ways to raise<br />\nrevenue.<br />\nThat means, for example, that<br />\nprofessors in the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, which projects a<br />\n$7-million deficit this year, will<br />\nsee lower pay raises for the next<br />\nfive years than will their colleagues elsewhere in the university, while the School of<br />\nMedicine, with a $3-million<br />\nsurplus, builds an $85-million<br />\nresearch facility (The Chronicle,<br />\nJanuary 4).<br />\nWhile the cutbacks at Hopkins<br />\nare unusual, the financial system<br />\nit uses is not unique. Several<br />\nother large private institutions, including Harvard University, the<br />\nUniversity of Miami, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, and<br />\nWashington University, also encourage or require their individual schools to be financially<br />\nindependent.<br />\nEach school that has such status<br />\ntypically retains its own tuition,<br />\ngifts, grant money, and other<br />\nrevenues, including income from<br />\nits share of the university endowment. At the same time, each<br />\nschool must pay for its teaching<br />\nand staff costs, facilities and<br />\nequipment, overhead, central services like maintenance, and a<br />\nshare of central administrative<br />\ncosts.<br />\n<br />\nDecentralization Has Its Risks<br />\nBut decentralizaiton has its<br />\nrisks, as the situation at Johns<br />\nHopkins demonstrates. Critics<br />\nsay the system encourages<br />\nneedless competition among<br />\nacademic divisions, contradicts<br />\nthe collegial spirit of a university, and fosters a corporate mentality and profit motive where<br />\nnone should exist. Decentralization, its critics say, also can accentuate distinctions between<br />\nhaves and have-nots, the \"rich\"<br />\nand \"poor\" schools within a<br />\nuniversity. And, the system can<br />\nconfound those who must live<br />\nwith its results.<br />\n\"It's not as if we in the faculty<br />\nof arts and sciences made some<br />\nmistake, or spent beyond our<br />\nmeans,\" says a senior professor<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nConcern about inter-divisional<br />\nrivalries is one reason Northwestern University continues to<br />\ncontrol its budget centrally, like<br />\nmost universities, pooling most<br />\nrevenues and making allocations<br />\nfrom a central office.<br />\n\"We believe that there is a<br />\nthing called a university,\" says<br />\nLee A. Ellis, vice-president for<br />\nbusiness and finance at Northwestern. \"That's central to the<br />\nsuccess of our schools.

In exchange<br />\nfor such burdens, deans are<br />\ntypically given increased<br />\nautonomy over budget decisions<br />\nin their schools and the right to<br />\nretain for their divisions most of<br />\nwhatever surpluses they might<br />\nearn.<br />\nSo far, decentralized budgeting<br />\nseems a phenomenon limited to<br />\nlarge, private research universities. But one public system, Indiana University, will begin<br />\ntesting a decentralized budget<br />\nplan next year. And many institutions are moving to increase fiscal<br />\nautonomy for some, but not all,<br />\n<br />\nof their divisions.<br />\nIronically, however, none of<br />\nthe universities that have adopted<br />\ndecentralized schemes have succeeded fully in making all of their<br />\ndivisions entirely self-supporting.<br />\n'Every Tub on Its Own Bottom'<br />\nEven the richest university in<br />\nthe country has its problems.<br />\nHarvard's \"every tub on its own<br />\nbottom\" plan requires its<br />\nfaculties, museums, the central<br />\nadministration, and various other<br />\nunits to \"live within the resources<br />\nthat are available to them,\" says<br />\nRobert Scott, vice-president for<br />\nfinance.<br />\nWith its $4.2-billion endowment, Harvard might not be expected to have financial difficulties.

Not unlike<br />\nthe groundhog, University President<br />\nSteven Muller every February emerges<br />\nfrom his winter seclusion to face a barrage of onlookers, photographers, and<br />\nreporters, and reveal data. Accompanied by a motley assortment of deans,<br />\ndirectors, and assistants, both Muller<br />\nand the groundhog tend to their business<br />\nquickly and leave as soon as possible.<br />\nRarely do Muller or the groundhog<br />\nreveal new concepts at these appearances. Spring inevitably comes, and<br />\nas we've seen, so does a tuition hike,<br />\nwith or without the star players. Still,<br />\nwe do count on them to supply the<br />\nnecessary numerical details: how much<br />\nlonger until spring'? and how much more<br />\nin tuition payments? And every now and<br />\nthen, during a bad winter, say, or a bad<br />\ndeficit, the details take on a special<br />\nsignificance.<br />\nIn keeping with the 1988-1989 \"bad<br />\ndeficit,\" the details of this year's foray<br />\nwere quite significant. The administration departed from tradition by proposing a two-tiered tuition system.<br />\nAlthough tuition will rise the customary<br />\n$1000 from $12000 to $13000, the 6%<br />\nincrease will apply only to continuing<br />\nstudents. New incoming students will<br />\npay $14000.<br />\nThe two-tiered system would be a<br />\n\"one-time action\" to be phased out<br />\nwhen the last group of current students<br />\nleave or graduate. According to Lloyd<br />\nArmstrong, dean of the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, the decision stemmed<br />\nfrom the administration's commitment<br />\nto keep tuition in line with incoming<br />\nstudents' expectations.<br />\n<br />\nArmstrong defended the increases<br />\nwith familiar arguments. While the<br />\n\"Tuition Fact Sheet\" distributed at<br />\nprevious meetings was thankfully abandoned this year, the dean attributed the<br />\nhike to rising costs and the relatively<br />\nlow percentage of cost covered by tuition. Armstrong and Muller also pledged maintenance of financial aid.<br />\nAnd so the tradition continues.<br />\nThe University's action is easy to attack popularly. After all, rising costs are<br />\nnever welcome measures. Indeed, the<br />\naverage undergraduate probably finds it<br />\nincreasingly difficult to justify, if not<br />\nmeet, the price of a private education.<br />\nOn the other hand, if tuition actually<br />\ncovers only a small proportion of the<br />\nprice, as the administration's warmedover rhetoric implies, then it is difficult<br />\nto see what other choice administrators<br />\nhave. Where will the difference come<br />\nfrom, if not in part from tuition? Clearly, maintaining that special Hopkins<br />\nquality is expensive, but letting it slide<br />\nwould be even more costly.<br />\nGiven that the University already considers undergraduates revenue raisers,<br />\nit is not a radical philosphical departure<br />\nto raise the amount each will pay. We<br />\ndo applaud the two-tiered system. If the<br />\ntuition is to be raised, it is fair to allow<br />\nparents and students to adjust their expectations accordingly. After all, past<br />\nyears have shown that tuition hikes,<br />\nhowever upsetting, are even more painful when more costly than anticipated.<br />\nSo, it is with a sense of resignation<br />\nthat we accept, however grudgingly, the<br />\nproposals that have been laid out before<br />\nus. In the final analysis, if we can continue our metaphor, the groundhog has<br />\nonly a limited number of options to act<br />\nupon each time he comes out.<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\nTy Hyderally on Barnes and Noble<br />\nThis article is in reference to<br />\nongoing meetings of the<br />\nBookstore Committee. At the<br />\nbeginning of the second meeting,<br />\nI asked Frank Waller, the Codirector of Auxiliary Enterprises,<br />\nif it was true that Paul, the director of the Bookstore, had the floor<br />\nfor most of the first meeting (a<br />\nmeeting which I could not make).<br />\nFrank responded affirmatively<br />\nand said that this couldn't be<br />\nhelped. As soon as the meeting<br />\nopened, he gave Paul the floor.<br />\nAfter Paul spoke for a minute or<br />\ntwo about the \"unfounded lambasting\" of the bookstore, I simply interrupted him with concerns<br />\nof the students. I did this with the<br />\nassumption that this was the only<br />\nway that our student interests<br />\nwould be heard. Paul was surprisingly amenable to answering my<br />\nquestions, and the meeting proceeded with Tony Tassi (the other<br />\nstudent rep) and myself getting<br />\n<br />\nour questions answered and our<br />\nsuggestions listened to.<br />\nWhen the meeting began, I was<br />\nhappy to notice that the representation was well-distributed\u2014a<br />\nhousemaster, a housing office administrator, two directors from<br />\nthe bookstore, two students, and<br />\nthe Co-director of Auxiliary Services!! Throughout the meeting,<br />\nI continually felt that it was Tony<br />\nand myself versus \"the team.\"<br />\nWe received little to no support<br />\nfrom any of the other members.<br />\nThey sat relatively comatose<br />\nwhile Paul, Tony, and I exchanged and countered various propositions. I wondered at times what<br />\ntheir purpose was. However, this<br />\nlack of participation on their part<br />\ndid not faze Tony or myself. We<br />\nsimply made up for the disparate<br />\ncondition by being extremely and<br />\npersistently vocal.<br />\nPaul answered all of our questions except one. I asked how<br />\n<br />\nmuch rent the bookstore pays to<br />\nthe school for the space. Paul<br />\ngave a long-winded answer,<br />\nbasically saying that it is a changing number dependent on gross<br />\nsales and taxes. When I persisted<br />\nby asking for a ballpark figure,<br />\nFrank promptly stepped in and<br />\nsaid that the information was confidential. So much for Frank being the impartial chairman of the<br />\nmeeting! I was about to embark<br />\non a quest for Glasnost, but time<br />\nwas limited and there were many<br />\ntangible points to cover.<br />\nThe most important matter that<br />\nI accomplished during the onehour meeting had to do with the<br />\nprovisions of contract renewal.<br />\nBarnes and Noble has been on our<br />\ncampus since 1981. In 1984, their<br />\nthree-year contract expired.

As of fall 1988, The Johns<br />\nHopkins University became the<br />\nproud owner of a street cleaner,<br />\nemblazoned with the university<br />\nseal and our school colors. It cost<br />\n$16,000.<br />\nBiff Brown, Director of Plant<br />\nOperations, justified the expenditure by stating that in the long<br />\nrun the machine will save the<br />\nUniversity money by having one<br />\nperson successfully do the work<br />\nof several.

What should have<br />\nbeen an exciting opportunity to<br />\nwork with an award-winning<br />\nplaywright unfortunately turned<br />\ninto four very stressful weeks for<br />\na number of students.<br />\nMr. Albee has in the past<br />\nchosen 5-6 student-written plays<br />\nto produce and direct during intersession. Students were involved in the re-writing, directing and<br />\nacting of the plays. This year,<br />\nhowever, he chose 9 plays to produce. This could have resulted in<br />\nthe chance for many students to<br />\nget to work with a \"professional.\" However, Mr. Albee did<br />\nnot see it fit to allow students to<br />\nhave these opportunities. Many of<br />\nthe 19 actors he chose to fill the<br />\n40 roles were double and triple<br />\ncast; furthermore, many<br />\nplaywrights and directors who did<br />\nnot audition were placed in slots<br />\nwhich could have been filled by<br />\nother students.<br />\nOf the plays produced, Mr.<br />\nAlbee found it necessary to direct<br />\nand work with only two plays\u2014a<br />\ntotal of five actors and two assistant directors. The rest of the<br />\nworks were left in the hands of<br />\nthe assistant direcotrs. These<br />\nwere all but ignored. As of the<br />\nMonday of production week, Mr.<br />\nAlbee had not even seen two of<br />\nthe plays. When asked why, he<br />\nclaimed he had \"not yet been invited.\" One would think that by<br />\nsigning up for a course entitled<br />\n\"Directing With Albee\" or \"Acting With Albee,\" Albee would<br />\nbe included in the deal. We don't<br />\nknow of many other classes to<br />\nwhich the professor must be invited by the students to attend.<br />\nAs classes began for the spring<br />\nsemester Albee became inflexible<br />\nand demanding. He required actors, directors and technicians to<br />\nmiss their classes in order to attend rehearsals during school<br />\nhours in addition to evening<br />\n<br />\nBookstore reform proposal<br />\n<br />\nrehearsals from 7 p.m. to midnight. It took several students'<br />\nmeeting with Dean Roseman to<br />\narrange a way to be allowed to go<br />\nto classes rather than rehearsals.<br />\nFor his immense amount of<br />\ntime and effort in producing these<br />\nplays, Albee was paid over<br />\n$30,000. For this money,<br />\nhowever, he did not attend one of<br />\nthe dress rehearsals, nor did he<br />\nbother to attend any of the Saturday or Sunday performances. At<br />\na time when the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences is in a deficit situation, it seems that neither the<br />\nstudents nor the university got<br />\ntheir money's worth. Although it<br />\nis nice for the Writing Seminars<br />\ndepartment to be able to claim<br />\nAlbee as a guest faculty member,<br />\nis it really worth it?<br />\n<br />\nHYDERALLY, from 8<br />\nmer vacation. Ever since 1981,<br />\nno outside bidding was allowed.<br />\nActually, I was corrected on my<br />\nchoice of terminology. The word<br />\nshould be \"sought,\" not \"allowed.\" I expressed my surprise that<br />\nno bidding was. . .sought during<br />\nthe four periods in which the contract came up for renewal. How<br />\ncould it have possible hurt to seek<br />\noutside bidders? The Auxiliary<br />\nServices methods seem to be a<br />\ntravesty of the ideals of capitalist<br />\ndemocracy. They have allowed<br />\nBarnes and Noble to exist as an<br />\nunchallenged monopoly for four<br />\nyears. Frank informed me of this<br />\nfact so flippantly that I am sure<br />\nthat he did no understand the<br />\nPresident<br />\nweight of the particular issue. Of<br />\nJames Stofan,<br />\nJeremy Golub, Vice President course, this was in keeping with<br />\nhis earlier remark that the<br />\nThe writers are President and bookstore issue was no a \"burnVice-President of the JHU ing issue\" which upset the<br />\nstudents. He pointed to the cornBarnstormers.<br />\n<br />\nplacency of the general student<br />\nbody as proof of this belief. This<br />\ncomment was made by the Chairman of the meeting before the<br />\nmeeting began. This comment<br />\nreflects the administration's lack<br />\nof concern for student issues, and<br />\nit bothers me that someone who<br />\nsees no point for the meetings or<br />\nfor change in the process should<br />\nbe allowed to chair the meeting.<br />\nI corrected what I believe to be<br />\nhis naive statement by claiming<br />\nthat the mere existence of the<br />\ncommittee is indication enough of<br />\nthe weight of the issue.<br />\nI ask that the monopoly status<br />\ngiven to Barnes and Noble be<br />\ndiscontinued. In addition, the<br />\nrenewal period should be shifted<br />\nto a date during one of the school<br />\nsemesters and that there be student representation on the committee that discusses bids and<br />\nmakes a decision. This commit-<br />\n<br />\ntee should meet annually.<br />\nFrank refused to commit<br />\nhimself one way or the other, and<br />\nI assume that the idea will get<br />\nsome thought. Regardless, I shall<br />\npush this issue until my requests<br />\nare met. I will receive a definitive<br />\nanswer before I graduate. The<br />\nbidding should always be competitive, and a student (or<br />\nstudents) must always be allowed to have a tangible and weighty<br />\ninput in the selection process. No<br />\nmore monopolies!!<br />\nWe also discussed profit<br />\nmargins. Paul informed me that<br />\nthe profits made on books is 2Q1,<br />\nthe profits on nontexts is<br />\nanywhere from 30-5(); and the<br />\nprofits on accessory items was<br />\n30-6Cr.

The incidences of rape and other violent<br />\nattacks that have occurred on<br />\ncampus in the past couple of years<br />\nhave both saddened and angered<br />\nme, as I feel that most of them<br />\ncould have been prevented. I<br />\nwould like to challenge the claim<br />\nmade by the administration that<br />\nCampus Security is \"doing all<br />\nthey can.\" I find this hard to<br />\nbelieve.<br />\nI cannot understand why<br />\nSecurity patrol Homewood by<br />\ncar, considering that the only two<br />\nroads we have cover very little of<br />\ncampus. The part of campus<br />\nwhere most students can be found<br />\nare the Upper, Lower and<br />\nFreshman quads. Of course,<br />\nthese are precisely the areas<br />\nwhere you are least likely to find<br />\n<br />\nSecurity since they are inaccessible by car. Strange, isn't it? And<br />\nto add insult to injury, there are<br />\ninstead undergrads dressed in<br />\nglow-in-the-dark orange stripes<br />\n\"monitoring\" these areas.<br />\nSounds real threatening. This puts<br />\nthese undergrads and all students<br />\nin a potentially dangerous and unfair situation.<br />\nI suggest a somewhat oldfashioned approach to a by now<br />\nlongstanding problem. Each<br />\nsecurity man should be assigned<br />\na small portion of campus to<br />\npatrol by foot, like a policeman's<br />\nbeat. Security men would<br />\ntherefore remain relatively stationary and all areas would be<br />\npatrolled at all times, especially<br />\nthose most frequented by<br />\nstudents. The constant presence<br />\nof a patrolman would be likely to<br />\ndeter a criminal and at the very<br />\nleast would ensure that a victim's<br />\ncries would be heard.<br />\nErica Roth<br />\n<br />\n..

Van Amerongen<br />\nstresses that a great many of the<br />\nkids are motivated and extremely intelligent.<br />\nIn describing what the Project<br />\nis looking for in tutors, Van<br />\nAmerongen says that they need,<br />\n\"somebody who is willing to<br />\ncommit themselves for the entire<br />\nsemester. . .and make this a good<br />\nexperience for the kid.

No, it's not biology,<br />\nBME, or IR, but public health,<br />\naccording to Public Health Advisor Charlotte Kaufman.<br />\nPublic Health has become a national priority as the public has<br />\nbecome more aware of health<br />\nissues such as smoking, AIDS,<br />\nand the environment. Public<br />\n<br />\nhealth is simply working for and<br />\nwith the public to develop and<br />\nmaintain good health.<br />\nAt Hopkins, undergrads interested in public health can pursue the Public Health Option in<br />\nconjunction with a natural, social,<br />\nor behavioral sciences major.<br />\nThe Public Health Option involves taking the usual science requirements as well as some<br />\ncourses at the School of Public<br />\nHealth and Hygiene. Kaufman<br />\n<br />\ndescribes it as \"an amazing opportunity for young people to<br />\nhave, to be involved in a school<br />\nof this quality.\"<br />\nThe School of Public Health is<br />\nthe oldest and most prestigious<br />\npublic health school in the world.<br />\nIt has students from around the<br />\nUnited States as well as from over<br />\n50 other countries. Some of its<br />\ntwelve departments are almost as<br />\nhard to get into as the medical<br />\nschool across the street, par-<br />\n<br />\nticularly epidemiology, maternal<br />\nand child health, population<br />\ndynamics, and environmental<br />\nsciences.<br />\nGraduates of the School of<br />\nPublic Health can find jobs<br />\nalmost immediately due to the<br />\noverwhelming demand for public<br />\nhealth professionals, such as.<br />\nhealth administrators and<br />\nepidemiologists. And first-year<br />\nsalaries range from $20,000<br />\n(nutritionist) to $30,000 (health<br />\nmanagement) and higher.

Kaufman<br />\nadvises anyone even thinking of<br />\nmed school to consider public<br />\nhealth. And under the Public<br />\nHealth Option, students can get to<br />\nknow faculty members at the<br />\nSchool, giving them an edge over<br />\ntheir peers.<br />\nStudents interested in public<br />\nhealth should first browse<br />\nthrough materials in 241<br />\n<br />\nMerganthaler.<br />\nBy the second semester of<br />\nsophomore year, students should<br />\nhave met with Kaufman to outline<br />\noptions in detail.

As the<br />\n<br />\nTop Tens Who Cares?<br />\nThe Year In Music Kern's Ten \u2022<br />\nThe Year in Review has always<br />\nbeen the traditional opportunity<br />\nfor music journalists and critics<br />\nto get out all the sweeping<br />\ngeneralizations, one-liners, and<br />\npet peeves they couldn't voice<br />\nduring the year. They incorporate<br />\nthem into a few pages' worth of<br />\nsharp-witted paragraphs, a list of<br />\nthe year's Best and Worst, and a<br />\n'column or two devoted to the<br />\nyear's trends. The adventurous<br />\nmay throw in a few predictions<br />\nbut only the truly daring will actually come right out and say it:<br />\n\"It was a good year.\"<br />\nWell, 1988 was a good year for<br />\na variety of reasons. Billboard<br />\nreported a sharp increase in the<br />\nnumber of gold and platinum<br />\nrecords awarded, and the recording industry in general is booming like never before. Burgeoning cassette and compact disc<br />\nsales are at the heart of the upsurge. Blessed with superior<br />\nsound and higher profit margins,<br />\nthe CD has totally rejuvenated the<br />\nreissue market, prompting record<br />\nlabels to digitally remaster their<br />\nback catalog, especially jazz,<br />\nblues, and \"classic rock\" titles.<br />\nSome critics argue that smaller<br />\n<br />\nlabels will be driven out of the<br />\nbusiness by their inability to pro- by T.H.

Listeners can only hope to<br />\nget the best slivers of the musical<br />\npie.<br />\nHence the rationale: critics can<br />\npoint lights into new corners, and<br />\ngive attention to obscure and<br />\nforgotten talents. A few million<br />\nlisteners heard parts of Tracy<br />\nChapman's debut last year, but<br />\nwho caught Leonard Cohen's sly,<br />\nsarcastic I'm Your Man? This<br />\ngem of an album went virtually<br />\nunnoticed. Cohen's pipes sound<br />\nwithered next to Chapman's, but<br />\nhis world-weary lyrics knock her<br />\nunder the table.

The direction<br />\nby Piccinnini is much better here,<br />\nfor he lets the actors loose with<br />\nthe characters. Joshua Coleman<br />\nplayed the disenchanted sax<br />\nplayer Rob with incredible depth<br />\nand honesty, and Nick Kierstead<br />\ngave an unforgettable performance as the aimless Peter.

A story of heavenly intervention, young Jack makes a<br />\ndeal with God to save the life of<br />\nhis dying sister by giving up the<br />\none thing he loves, football.<br />\nWell-written and impeccably<br />\ndeveloped, A Trade Offhas all the<br />\n<br />\n_ \u2014<br />\ni ngredients of an interesting<br />\nthought provoking play, but it remained oddly unsatisfying to the<br />\naudience. The problem lies in the<br />\ncharacter Jack, who is completely unlikable, particularly because<br />\nhe has to take so much time to<br />\ndecide between his sister and<br />\nfootball. On a tip from a young<br />\ngirl in the hospital lobby waiting<br />\nfor her mother to give birth. Jack<br />\nchooses his sister's life in the<br />\nhope that God is only testing his<br />\nfaith, and his unselfishness will<br />\nallow him to keep football as<br />\nwell. Of course, God can see<br />\nright through his shallowness and<br />\nJack gets just what he<br />\ndeserves. Nice twist, but God<br />\nbecomes a real joker, unloving<br />\nand spiteful. Jack is doubtful and<br />\nresenting because his life has<br />\nbeen truly a nightmare of losses,<br />\nand he has reason to be the way<br />\nhe is. Had he been spoiled with<br />\na silver spoon in his mouth, then<br />\nthe outcome of the deal would<br />\nprobably have brought about a<br />\nchange in his character. If God's<br />\n<br />\nintentions were to make Jack a<br />\nbetter person, to restore his faith<br />\nin Him, then He failed miserably.<br />\nJack needs to change; otherwise,<br />\nthe play is pointless.

Chris McColl<br />\nnearly stole the lead in a wonderful performance as Aggie's narnew<br />\ncissistic, conceited<br />\nboyfriend, Donetti, who surprised everyone with a touching introspection on his life later in the<br />\nplay. Meanwhile, a confused<br />\nRaise receives conflicting advice<br />\nfrom some unlikely sources, two<br />\nbums that hang around the park<br />\nwhere Raise goes to think.

WHEELER<br />\nBETHESDA, MD.<br />\n<br />\nThe first federally approved experiment involving the transfer of<br />\nforeign genes into humans may<br />\nprovoke a lawsuit and fresh<br />\npublic debate over gene<br />\ntherapy\u2014the medical alteration of<br />\ngenes to treat disease.<br />\nThe initial experiment was approved last month by the National<br />\nInstitutes of Health and will be<br />\nperformed by N.I.H. researchers.<br />\nThe<br />\nprogress<br />\nof the<br />\nexperiment\u2014not technically gene<br />\ntherapy\u2014will be watched closely by medical scientists around<br />\nthe country who are working on<br />\nforms of gene therapy to treat<br />\nAIDS, cancer, liver disease, emphysema, and diseases of the<br />\nblood such as sickle-cell anemia.<br />\nThe initial experiment is not considered gene therapy because the<br />\nforeign genes are not part of the<br />\ntreatment. Instead, they are being<br />\nused by researchers to trace the<br />\nactivity of some cancer-fighting<br />\ncells.<br />\nAdvisory Committee Sought<br />\nJeremy Rifkin. president of the<br />\nFoundation on Economic Trends<br />\nand a frequent opponent of<br />\nbiotechnology research, said he<br />\nwould do his best to stall the<br />\nbeginning of the experiment until the institutes agree to create a<br />\n'Human Eugenics Advisory<br />\nCommittee,'' which would<br />\nreview the social and civil liberties implications of each genetherapy experiment the N.I.H.<br />\napproves. Mr. Rifkin has formed<br />\na coalition of groups that fight<br />\ndiscrimination against the handicapped and that will also support his effort in setting up a new<br />\nadvisory committee.<br />\nMr. Rifkin said last week that<br />\nhe was contemplating a lawsuit,<br />\nwhich could be announced at this<br />\nweek's meeting of the N.I.H.<br />\ncommittee that reviews experiments involving genetic<br />\nalteration.<br />\nMr. Rifkin, together with a<br />\nnumber of environmental groups,<br />\ndelayed for years the start of a<br />\nUniversity of California experiJohns Hopkins University<br />\nastronomers reported today that<br />\nthey have found optical light<br />\nfrom the expanding remains or<br />\n\"remnant\" of a supernova that<br />\nexploded 32 years ago in nearby spiral galaxy M83.<br />\nThis new supernova remnant, Supernova 1957d, is 10<br />\ntimes younger than the<br />\nyoungest known supernova<br />\nremnant in our own galaxy, the<br />\nMilky Way. The discovery is<br />\nremarkable because this is the<br />\nyoungest remnant ever located<br />\nby a visible-light telescope.<br />\nThis is also the first time in<br />\nmodern astronomy that scientists have observed optically<br />\nboth the supernova explosion<br />\nitself\u2014in I957\u2014and the reappearance of the supernova<br />\nremnant.<br />\nThe report was made by Drs.<br />\nKnox S. Long and William P.<br />\n<br />\nment to test the frost-resistance of<br />\nstrawberries treated with<br />\ngenetically altered bacteria.<br />\nMr. Rifkin said he objected not<br />\nso much to the first gene-transfer<br />\nexperiment into humans as to<br />\nwhat he believes genetic<br />\nengineering might eventually lead<br />\nto. For example, he said, companies might eventually try to<br />\nmodify workers to make them<br />\nmore resistant to toxic chemicals<br />\nso they could work around the<br />\nchemicals.<br />\nEvan J. Kemp, Jr., a commissioner of the Equal Employment<br />\nOpportunity Commission, said he<br />\nplanned to support Mr. Rifkin's<br />\nattempt to establish a new advisory committee. Mr. Kemp said<br />\nhe feared genetic engineering<br />\nmight lead to greater discrimination against those with<br />\ndisabilities.<br />\n\"We should start glorying in<br />\nour differences and not try to find<br />\nthe perfectly acceptable human<br />\nbeing,\" said Mr. Kemp.<br />\nRobert M. Cook-Deegan, the<br />\ndirector of a 1984 Office of<br />\nTechnology Assessment study on<br />\ngene therapy, said that Mr.<br />\nRifkin's proposal for an advisory<br />\ncommittee would not work. \"The<br />\nissues he worries about are real,\"<br />\nsaid Mr. Cook-Deegan. \"The<br />\nmechanism for dealing with them<br />\nis ill thought out.\"<br />\nMr. Cook-Deegan, who is currently the acting executive director of a congressionally appointed<br />\nBiomedical Ethics Advisory<br />\nCommittee, said that \"eugenics\"<br />\nwas the wrong word to use since<br />\nit has nothing to do with gene<br />\ntherapy. He also said the suggested scope of the committee,<br />\nwith its emphasis on discrimination and civil law, was inappropriate for an advisory committee to the N.I.H.<br />\nMr. Cook-Deegan recited a<br />\nalong list of private and government reports, hearings, and<br />\npublic symposia on the subject of<br />\ngene therapy, and noted that the<br />\nproposed experiment had been<br />\nthe subject of discussion in five<br />\nN.I.H. committees, including the<br />\nN.I.H. Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, which has<br />\nbeen discussing gene-therapy experiment since 1983.<br />\n\"I can't think of any other<br />\ntechnology that's received so<br />\nmuch public scrutiny,\" Mr.<br />\n<br />\nCook-Deegan said.<br />\nMr. Rifkin said the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee<br />\nhad done a \"decent job,\" but said<br />\nits concerns were too limited to<br />\nthe health of patients.<br />\nThe advent of gene-therapy experiments with humans has long<br />\nbeen heralded by scientists, but<br />\nhas been slow to actually arrive.<br />\nSince 1984, scientists have said<br />\nthey expected such experiments<br />\nto start within the year. But<br />\ntechnical problems and concern<br />\nthat the therapy might backfire<br />\nand cause a new disease while<br />\ncuring an old one have held up<br />\nexperiments.<br />\nGene therapy is a catch-all term<br />\ncovering many approaches. Most<br />\nof the research is aimed at trying<br />\nto genetically alter a specific kind<br />\nof cell in the body, such as a cell<br />\nfrom the bone marrow or skin, to<br />\nchange function. The cells would<br />\nbe taken from the body and then<br />\nreturned after the genetic<br />\nalteration.<br />\nScientists are working on<br />\ngenetically altering cells to produce enzymes missing in those<br />\nwith certain diseases. In another<br />\napproach, scientists are trying to<br />\nchange cells so they would<br />\nmanufacture biological agents<br />\nthat could fight a disease\u2014turning<br />\nthe body itself, in effect, into a<br />\ndrug-delivery system. Some<br />\ncancer researchers are even trying to alter cancerous cells<br />\ngenetically so they would produce<br />\na lethal toxin that would force the<br />\ncells to commit suicide.<br />\nScientists have avoided proposing any research that could lead<br />\nto changing the body in any way<br />\nthat could be inherited, because<br />\nthey believe such experiments<br />\nwould be strongly opposed by the<br />\npublic and would never get<br />\nfederal approval.<br />\nThe initial gene-transfer experiment at N.I.H., which will<br />\nuse transplanted bacterial genes to<br />\ntrace the activity of some white<br />\nblood cells in 10 cancer patients,<br />\nindicates a shift in the approach<br />\nthat gene therapy researchers are<br />\ntaking.

Their record now<br />\nstands at two wins, five losses,<br />\nand one tie.<br />\nThe Jays have had only one<br />\npractice since the January break,<br />\nwhich may explain their \"lack of<br />\nintensity on the ice,\" according<br />\nto coach Steve Wirth after their<br />\n6-2 loss to Bucknell. Hopkins<br />\nplayed a fairly good defensive<br />\ngame during the first two periods<br />\nand they were down by only one<br />\ngoal going into the third period,<br />\nthanks to goals scored by center<br />\nPat Gibbons and left wing Vinnie<br />\nAlfi. However, Bucknell<br />\ndominated the last period at the<br />\ndrop of the puck. The Jays'<br />\ndefense seemed to be one step<br />\nbehind its opponents as they were<br />\noften caught too deep in<br />\nBucknell's end, resulting in<br />\nseveral break-aways and many<br />\ntwo-on-ones.<br />\nIf the Blue Jays lacked intensity in their first game, they lacked a lot more than that in their<br />\ngame on Monday against Gettysburg. The entire game was<br />\nplayed at a sub-par level by<br />\nHopkins, as they were out-hustled<br />\nand outsmarted by an obviously<br />\nless talented team.<br />\n\"It's just another case of us losing to an inferior team,\" said<br />\nWirth.<br />\nThe Jays' biggest problem was<br />\ntheir inability to remove opposing players in front of their own<br />\nnet. Instead of tying up the man<br />\nin front, the centers were hang-<br />\n<br />\ning at their blue line, waiting for<br />\nan outlet pass, which unfortunately never came. This gave Gettysburg two, sometimes even<br />\nthree, extra scoring opportunities<br />\non goalie Dave Bower. Bower,<br />\ndespite constant pressure, played<br />\na solid game and made over thirty saves.

Reprinted<br />\nwith permission.<br />\nBy GILBERT FUCHSBERG<br /><br />\nBy several measures of financial success, the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity appears to be doing<br />\nquite well. It reported a<br />\n$16-million surplus last year, has<br />\nraised more than $512-million in<br />\nprivate donations since 1984, and<br />\nranks first among universities in<br />\nfederal research support, with<br />\nnearly $500-million in grants and<br />\ncontracts.<br />\nNonetheless, Hopkins officials<br />\nrecently announced a plan to cut<br />\n10 per cent of the arts-andsciences faculty, increase<br />\nundergraduate enrollment and tuition, and delay indefinitely<br />\nseveral major building projects<br />\nand academic ventures.<br />\nMany people might wonder: If<br />\nthe university appears to be flush<br />\nwith cash, why is it taking such<br />\ndramatic action to cut costs and<br />\nincrease revenues?<br />\nThe answer lies in the way in<br />\nwhich Johns Hopkins manages its<br />\ndivisions. While most universities<br />\ncontrol their finances centrally,<br />\nroutinely using surpluses from<br />\none division to cover another's<br />\nlosses, Hopkins demands of its<br />\ndivisions an unusual degree of<br />\nself-sufficiency.<br />\nEven though some divisions<br />\nmay show profits, and even<br /><br />\nthough the university as a whole<br />\nmay take in more money than it<br />\nspends, any division that does not<br />\nat least break even must cut its<br />\ncosts and look for ways to raise<br />\nrevenue.<br />\nThat means, for example, that<br />\nprofessors in the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, which projects a<br />\n$7-million deficit this year, will<br />\nsee lower pay raises for the next<br />\nfive years than will their colleagues elsewhere in the university, while the School of<br />\nMedicine, with a $3-million<br />\nsurplus, builds an $85-million<br />\nresearch facility (The Chronicle,<br />\nJanuary 4).<br />\nWhile the cutbacks at Hopkins<br />\nare unusual, the financial system<br />\nit uses is not unique. Several<br />\nother large private institutions, including Harvard University, the<br />\nUniversity of Miami, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, and<br />\nWashington University, also encourage or require their individual schools to be financially<br />\nindependent.<br />\nEach school that has such status<br />\ntypically retains its own tuition,<br />\ngifts, grant money, and other<br />\nrevenues, including income from<br />\nits share of the university endowment. At the same time, each<br />\nschool must pay for its teaching<br />\nand staff costs, facilities and<br />\nequipment, overhead, central services like maintenance, and a<br />\nshare of central administrative<br />\ncosts.<br /><br />\nDecentralization Has Its Risks<br />\nBut decentralizaiton has its<br />\nrisks, as the situation at Johns<br />\nHopkins demonstrates. Critics<br />\nsay the system encourages<br />\nneedless competition among<br />\nacademic divisions, contradicts<br />\nthe collegial spirit of a university, and fosters a corporate mentality and profit motive where<br />\nnone should exist. Decentralization, its critics say, also can accentuate distinctions between<br />\nhaves and have-nots, the \"rich\"<br />\nand \"poor\" schools within a<br />\nuniversity. And, the system can<br />\nconfound those who must live<br />\nwith its results.<br />\n\"It's not as if we in the faculty<br />\nof arts and sciences made some<br />\nmistake, or spent beyond our<br />\nmeans,\" says a senior professor<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nConcern about inter-divisional<br />\nrivalries is one reason Northwestern University continues to<br />\ncontrol its budget centrally, like<br />\nmost universities, pooling most<br />\nrevenues and making allocations<br />\nfrom a central office.<br />\n\"We believe that there is a<br />\nthing called a university,\" says<br />\nLee A.

In exchange<br />\nfor such burdens, deans are<br />\ntypically given increased<br />\nautonomy over budget decisions<br />\nin their schools and the right to<br />\nretain for their divisions most of<br />\nwhatever surpluses they might<br />\nearn.<br />\nSo far, decentralized budgeting<br />\nseems a phenomenon limited to<br />\nlarge, private research universities. But one public system, Indiana University, will begin<br />\ntesting a decentralized budget<br />\nplan next year. And many institutions are moving to increase fiscal<br />\nautonomy for some, but not all,<br /><br />\nof their divisions.<br />\nIronically, however, none of<br />\nthe universities that have adopted<br />\ndecentralized schemes have succeeded fully in making all of their<br />\ndivisions entirely self-supporting.<br />\n'Every Tub on Its Own Bottom'<br />\nEven the richest university in<br />\nthe country has its problems.<br />\nHarvard's \"every tub on its own<br />\nbottom\" plan requires its<br />\nfaculties, museums, the central<br />\nadministration, and various other<br />\nunits to \"live within the resources<br />\nthat are available to them,\" says<br />\nRobert Scott, vice-president for<br />\nfinance.<br />\nWith its $4.2-billion endowment, Harvard might not be expected to have financial difficulties. But even its largest and<br />\nbest-endowed divisions\u2014arts and<br />\nsciences and the medical<br />\nschool\u2014often have problems<br />\nmaking ends meet and must occasionally seek a loan from the<br />\ncentral administration.

Not unlike<br />\nthe groundhog, University President<br />\nSteven Muller every February emerges<br />\nfrom his winter seclusion to face a barrage of onlookers, photographers, and<br />\nreporters, and reveal data. Accompanied by a motley assortment of deans,<br />\ndirectors, and assistants, both Muller<br />\nand the groundhog tend to their business<br />\nquickly and leave as soon as possible.<br />\nRarely do Muller or the groundhog<br />\nreveal new concepts at these appearances. Spring inevitably comes, and<br />\nas we've seen, so does a tuition hike,<br />\nwith or without the star players. Still,<br />\nwe do count on them to supply the<br />\nnecessary numerical details: how much<br />\nlonger until spring'? and how much more<br />\nin tuition payments? And every now and<br />\nthen, during a bad winter, say, or a bad<br />\ndeficit, the details take on a special<br />\nsignificance.<br />\nIn keeping with the 1988-1989 \"bad<br />\ndeficit,\" the details of this year's foray<br />\nwere quite significant. The administration departed from tradition by proposing a two-tiered tuition system.<br />\nAlthough tuition will rise the customary<br />\n$1000 from $12000 to $13000, the 6%<br />\nincrease will apply only to continuing<br />\nstudents. New incoming students will<br />\npay $14000.<br />\nThe two-tiered system would be a<br />\n\"one-time action\" to be phased out<br />\nwhen the last group of current students<br />\nleave or graduate. According to Lloyd<br />\nArmstrong, dean of the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences, the decision stemmed<br />\nfrom the administration's commitment<br />\nto keep tuition in line with incoming<br />\nstudents' expectations.<br /><br />\nArmstrong defended the increases<br />\nwith familiar arguments. While the<br />\n\"Tuition Fact Sheet\" distributed at<br />\nprevious meetings was thankfully abandoned this year, the dean attributed the<br />\nhike to rising costs and the relatively<br />\nlow percentage of cost covered by tuition. Armstrong and Muller also pledged maintenance of financial aid.<br />\nAnd so the tradition continues.<br />\nThe University's action is easy to attack popularly. After all, rising costs are<br />\nnever welcome measures. Indeed, the<br />\naverage undergraduate probably finds it<br />\nincreasingly difficult to justify, if not<br />\nmeet, the price of a private education.<br />\nOn the other hand, if tuition actually<br />\ncovers only a small proportion of the<br />\nprice, as the administration's warmedover rhetoric implies, then it is difficult<br />\nto see what other choice administrators<br />\nhave. Where will the difference come<br />\nfrom, if not in part from tuition? Clearly, maintaining that special Hopkins<br />\nquality is expensive, but letting it slide<br />\nwould be even more costly.<br />\nGiven that the University already considers undergraduates revenue raisers,<br />\nit is not a radical philosphical departure<br />\nto raise the amount each will pay. We<br />\ndo applaud the two-tiered system. If the<br />\ntuition is to be raised, it is fair to allow<br />\nparents and students to adjust their expectations accordingly. After all, past<br />\nyears have shown that tuition hikes,<br />\nhowever upsetting, are even more painful when more costly than anticipated.<br />\nSo, it is with a sense of resignation<br />\nthat we accept, however grudgingly, the<br />\nproposals that have been laid out before<br />\nus. In the final analysis, if we can continue our metaphor, the groundhog has<br />\nonly a limited number of options to act<br />\nupon each time he comes out.<br /><br />\nOpinion<br />\nTy Hyderally on Barnes and Noble<br />\nThis article is in reference to<br />\nongoing meetings of the<br />\nBookstore Committee. At the<br />\nbeginning of the second meeting,<br />\nI asked Frank Waller, the Codirector of Auxiliary Enterprises,<br />\nif it was true that Paul, the director of the Bookstore, had the floor<br />\nfor most of the first meeting (a<br />\nmeeting which I could not make).<br />\nFrank responded affirmatively<br />\nand said that this couldn't be<br />\nhelped. As soon as the meeting<br />\nopened, he gave Paul the floor.<br />\nAfter Paul spoke for a minute or<br />\ntwo about the \"unfounded lambasting\" of the bookstore, I simply interrupted him with concerns<br />\nof the students. I did this with the<br />\nassumption that this was the only<br />\nway that our student interests<br />\nwould be heard. Paul was surprisingly amenable to answering my<br />\nquestions, and the meeting proceeded with Tony Tassi (the other<br />\nstudent rep) and myself getting<br /><br />\nour questions answered and our<br />\nsuggestions listened to.<br />\nWhen the meeting began, I was<br />\nhappy to notice that the representation was well-distributed\u2014a<br />\nhousemaster, a housing office administrator, two directors from<br />\nthe bookstore, two students, and<br />\nthe Co-director of Auxiliary Services!! Throughout the meeting,<br />\nI continually felt that it was Tony<br />\nand myself versus \"the team.\"<br />\nWe received little to no support<br />\nfrom any of the other members.<br />\nThey sat relatively comatose<br />\nwhile Paul, Tony, and I exchanged and countered various propositions. I wondered at times what<br />\ntheir purpose was. However, this<br />\nlack of participation on their part<br />\ndid not faze Tony or myself. We<br />\nsimply made up for the disparate<br />\ncondition by being extremely and<br />\npersistently vocal.<br />\nPaul answered all of our questions except one. I asked how<br /><br />\nmuch rent the bookstore pays to<br />\nthe school for the space. Paul<br />\ngave a long-winded answer,<br />\nbasically saying that it is a changing number dependent on gross<br />\nsales and taxes. When I persisted<br />\nby asking for a ballpark figure,<br />\nFrank promptly stepped in and<br />\nsaid that the information was confidential. So much for Frank being the impartial chairman of the<br />\nmeeting! I was about to embark<br />\non a quest for Glasnost, but time<br />\nwas limited and there were many<br />\ntangible points to cover.<br />\nThe most important matter that<br />\nI accomplished during the onehour meeting had to do with the<br />\nprovisions of contract renewal.<br />\nBarnes and Noble has been on our<br />\ncampus since 1981.

It cost<br />\n$16,000.<br />\nBiff Brown, Director of Plant<br />\nOperations, justified the expenditure by stating that in the long<br />\nrun the machine will save the<br />\nUniversity money by having one<br />\nperson successfully do the work<br />\nof several. The streetcleaner<br />\nfunctions, Brown explained,<br />\n\"just like a vacuum cleaner; same<br />\nprinciple as a vacuum cleaner.\"<br />\nLeaves and other debris are collected in a compartment and then<br />\nthrown into a dumpster.<br />\nInnocuous though this acquisition may seem, it indicates a<br />\nbroader problem with the way the<br />\nUniversity approaches its costs,<br />\nas a look at other small, wealthier<br />\nArts and Sciences colleges in the<br />\nNortheast shows.<br />\nThe University of Pennsylvania<br />\nwas alone among Swarthmore<br />\nCollege, Haverford College, and<br />\nWesleyan University in owning a<br />\nstreetcleaner.

What should have<br />\nbeen an exciting opportunity to<br />\nwork with an award-winning<br />\nplaywright unfortunately turned<br />\ninto four very stressful weeks for<br />\na number of students.<br />\nMr. Albee has in the past<br />\nchosen 5-6 student-written plays<br />\nto produce and direct during intersession. Students were involved in the re-writing, directing and<br />\nacting of the plays. This year,<br />\nhowever, he chose 9 plays to produce. This could have resulted in<br />\nthe chance for many students to<br />\nget to work with a \"professional.\" However, Mr. Albee did<br />\nnot see it fit to allow students to<br />\nhave these opportunities. Many of<br />\nthe 19 actors he chose to fill the<br />\n40 roles were double and triple<br />\ncast; furthermore, many<br />\nplaywrights and directors who did<br />\nnot audition were placed in slots<br />\nwhich could have been filled by<br />\nother students.<br />\nOf the plays produced, Mr.<br />\nAlbee found it necessary to direct<br />\nand work with only two plays\u2014a<br />\ntotal of five actors and two assistant directors. The rest of the<br />\nworks were left in the hands of<br />\nthe assistant direcotrs. These<br />\nwere all but ignored. As of the<br />\nMonday of production week, Mr.<br />\nAlbee had not even seen two of<br />\nthe plays. When asked why, he<br />\nclaimed he had \"not yet been invited.\" One would think that by<br />\nsigning up for a course entitled<br />\n\"Directing With Albee\" or \"Acting With Albee,\" Albee would<br />\nbe included in the deal. We don't<br />\nknow of many other classes to<br />\nwhich the professor must be invited by the students to attend.<br />\nAs classes began for the spring<br />\nsemester Albee became inflexible<br />\nand demanding. He required actors, directors and technicians to<br />\nmiss their classes in order to attend rehearsals during school<br />\nhours in addition to evening<br /><br />\nBookstore reform proposal<br /><br />\nrehearsals from 7 p.m. to midnight. It took several students'<br />\nmeeting with Dean Roseman to<br />\narrange a way to be allowed to go<br />\nto classes rather than rehearsals.<br />\nFor his immense amount of<br />\ntime and effort in producing these<br />\nplays, Albee was paid over<br />\n$30,000. For this money,<br />\nhowever, he did not attend one of<br />\nthe dress rehearsals, nor did he<br />\nbother to attend any of the Saturday or Sunday performances. At<br />\na time when the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences is in a deficit situation, it seems that neither the<br />\nstudents nor the university got<br />\ntheir money's worth. Although it<br />\nis nice for the Writing Seminars<br />\ndepartment to be able to claim<br />\nAlbee as a guest faculty member,<br />\nis it really worth it?<br /><br />\nHYDERALLY, from 8<br />\nmer vacation. Ever since 1981,<br />\nno outside bidding was allowed.<br />\nActually, I was corrected on my<br />\nchoice of terminology. The word<br />\nshould be \"sought,\" not \"allowed.\" I expressed my surprise that<br />\nno bidding was. . .sought during<br />\nthe four periods in which the contract came up for renewal. How<br />\ncould it have possible hurt to seek<br />\noutside bidders? The Auxiliary<br />\nServices methods seem to be a<br />\ntravesty of the ideals of capitalist<br />\ndemocracy. They have allowed<br />\nBarnes and Noble to exist as an<br />\nunchallenged monopoly for four<br />\nyears. Frank informed me of this<br />\nfact so flippantly that I am sure<br />\nthat he did no understand the<br />\nPresident<br />\nweight of the particular issue. Of<br />\nJames Stofan,<br />\nJeremy Golub, Vice President course, this was in keeping with<br />\nhis earlier remark that the<br />\nThe writers are President and bookstore issue was no a \"burnVice-President of the JHU ing issue\" which upset the<br />\nstudents. He pointed to the cornBarnstormers.<br /><br />\nplacency of the general student<br />\nbody as proof of this belief. This<br />\ncomment was made by the Chairman of the meeting before the<br />\nmeeting began. This comment<br />\nreflects the administration's lack<br />\nof concern for student issues, and<br />\nit bothers me that someone who<br />\nsees no point for the meetings or<br />\nfor change in the process should<br />\nbe allowed to chair the meeting.<br />\nI corrected what I believe to be<br />\nhis naive statement by claiming<br />\nthat the mere existence of the<br />\ncommittee is indication enough of<br />\nthe weight of the issue.<br />\nI ask that the monopoly status<br />\ngiven to Barnes and Noble be<br />\ndiscontinued. In addition, the<br />\nrenewal period should be shifted<br />\nto a date during one of the school<br />\nsemesters and that there be student representation on the committee that discusses bids and<br />\nmakes a decision. This commit-<br /><br />\ntee should meet annually.<br />\nFrank refused to commit<br />\nhimself one way or the other, and<br />\nI assume that the idea will get<br />\nsome thought. Regardless, I shall<br />\npush this issue until my requests<br />\nare met. I will receive a definitive<br />\nanswer before I graduate. The<br />\nbidding should always be competitive, and a student (or<br />\nstudents) must always be allowed to have a tangible and weighty<br />\ninput in the selection process. No<br />\nmore monopolies!!<br />\nWe also discussed profit<br />\nmargins. Paul informed me that<br />\nthe profits made on books is 2Q1,<br />\nthe profits on nontexts is<br />\nanywhere from 30-5(); and the<br />\nprofits on accessory items was<br />\n30-6Cr.

The incidences of rape and other violent<br />\nattacks that have occurred on<br />\ncampus in the past couple of years<br />\nhave both saddened and angered<br />\nme, as I feel that most of them<br />\ncould have been prevented. I<br />\nwould like to challenge the claim<br />\nmade by the administration that<br />\nCampus Security is \"doing all<br />\nthey can.\" I find this hard to<br />\nbelieve.<br />\nI cannot understand why<br />\nSecurity patrol Homewood by<br />\ncar, considering that the only two<br />\nroads we have cover very little of<br />\ncampus. The part of campus<br />\nwhere most students can be found<br />\nare the Upper, Lower and<br />\nFreshman quads. Of course,<br />\nthese are precisely the areas<br />\nwhere you are least likely to find<br /><br />\nSecurity since they are inaccessible by car. Strange, isn't it? And<br />\nto add insult to injury, there are<br />\ninstead undergrads dressed in<br />\nglow-in-the-dark orange stripes<br />\n\"monitoring\" these areas.<br />\nSounds real threatening. This puts<br />\nthese undergrads and all students<br />\nin a potentially dangerous and unfair situation.<br />\nI suggest a somewhat oldfashioned approach to a by now<br />\nlongstanding problem. Each<br />\nsecurity man should be assigned<br />\na small portion of campus to<br />\npatrol by foot, like a policeman's<br />\nbeat. Security men would<br />\ntherefore remain relatively stationary and all areas would be<br />\npatrolled at all times, especially<br />\nthose most frequented by<br />\nstudents. The constant presence<br />\nof a patrolman would be likely to<br />\ndeter a criminal and at the very<br />\nleast would ensure that a victim's<br />\ncries would be heard.<br />\nErica Roth<br /><br />\n..

As the<br /><br />\nTop Tens Who Cares?<br />\nThe Year In Music Kern's Ten \u2022<br />\nThe Year in Review has always<br />\nbeen the traditional opportunity<br />\nfor music journalists and critics<br />\nto get out all the sweeping<br />\ngeneralizations, one-liners, and<br />\npet peeves they couldn't voice<br />\nduring the year. They incorporate<br />\nthem into a few pages' worth of<br />\nsharp-witted paragraphs, a list of<br />\nthe year's Best and Worst, and a<br />\n'column or two devoted to the<br />\nyear's trends. The adventurous<br />\nmay throw in a few predictions<br />\nbut only the truly daring will actually come right out and say it:<br />\n\"It was a good year.\"<br />\nWell, 1988 was a good year for<br />\na variety of reasons. Billboard<br />\nreported a sharp increase in the<br />\nnumber of gold and platinum<br />\nrecords awarded, and the recording industry in general is booming like never before. Burgeoning cassette and compact disc<br />\nsales are at the heart of the upsurge. Blessed with superior<br />\nsound and higher profit margins,<br />\nthe CD has totally rejuvenated the<br />\nreissue market, prompting record<br />\nlabels to digitally remaster their<br />\nback catalog, especially jazz,<br />\nblues, and \"classic rock\" titles.<br />\nSome critics argue that smaller<br /><br />\nlabels will be driven out of the<br />\nbusiness by their inability to pro- by T.H.

Whatever happens, 1988 bing, or dancing to the tops (and<br />\nmanaged to find a decent balance bottoms) of the pops, they are the<br />\nbetween the commerce and art, industry's true pundits. Still,<br />\npap and pop. For every empty- every year finds print critics purheaded, remixed remake that ring with approval, then roaring<br />\nclimbed the charts, there seemed in dismay\u2014all over records.

They aren't necessarily<br />\nplaylists for the masses; commercial radio has that area covered.<br />\nBut too many disks are released<br />\neach year for any one person to<br />\nhear. Listeners can only hope to<br />\nget the best slivers of the musical<br />\npie.<br />\nHence the rationale: critics can<br />\npoint lights into new corners, and<br />\ngive attention to obscure and<br />\nforgotten talents. A few million<br />\nlisteners heard parts of Tracy<br />\nChapman's debut last year, but<br />\nwho caught Leonard Cohen's sly,<br />\nsarcastic I'm Your Man? This<br />\ngem of an album went virtually<br />\nunnoticed. Cohen's pipes sound<br />\nwithered next to Chapman's, but<br />\nhis world-weary lyrics knock her<br />\nunder the table.

The direction<br />\nby Piccinnini is much better here,<br />\nfor he lets the actors loose with<br />\nthe characters. Joshua Coleman<br />\nplayed the disenchanted sax<br />\nplayer Rob with incredible depth<br />\nand honesty, and Nick Kierstead<br />\ngave an unforgettable performance as the aimless Peter. Paul<br />\nBoardman, as Richard, and Jennifer Vettraino as Rebecca were<br />\nalso convincing as the concerned<br />\nyet obtuse parents.<br />\nHow to Find a Girlfriend in<br />\nThree Easy Acts, by Douglas<br />\nBarre, was exactly how it sounds:<br />\na sophomoric look at nerd love<br />\nand ineptitude.

The bombardment<br />\nof sight gags, one liners, and<br />\nasides to the audience put the lead<br />\ncharacter, Case (Richard<br />\nBronsvag), in a role much like a<br />\nstand-up comedian, so the inevitable bombs were awkward for<br />\neveryone\u2014playwright, charactors, and audience.

The problem lies in the<br />\ncharacter Jack, who is completely unlikable, particularly because<br />\nhe has to take so much time to<br />\ndecide between his sister and<br />\nfootball. On a tip from a young<br />\ngirl in the hospital lobby waiting<br />\nfor her mother to give birth. Jack<br />\nchooses his sister's life in the<br />\nhope that God is only testing his<br />\nfaith, and his unselfishness will<br />\nallow him to keep football as<br />\nwell. Of course, God can see<br />\nright through his shallowness and<br />\nJack gets just what he<br />\ndeserves. Nice twist, but God<br />\nbecomes a real joker, unloving<br />\nand spiteful. Jack is doubtful and<br />\nresenting because his life has<br />\nbeen truly a nightmare of losses,<br />\nand he has reason to be the way<br />\nhe is. Had he been spoiled with<br />\na silver spoon in his mouth, then<br />\nthe outcome of the deal would<br />\nprobably have brought about a<br />\nchange in his character. If God's<br /><br />\nintentions were to make Jack a<br />\nbetter person, to restore his faith<br />\nin Him, then He failed miserably.<br />\nJack needs to change; otherwise,<br />\nthe play is pointless.

WHEELER<br />\nBETHESDA, MD.<br /><br />\nThe first federally approved experiment involving the transfer of<br />\nforeign genes into humans may<br />\nprovoke a lawsuit and fresh<br />\npublic debate over gene<br />\ntherapy\u2014the medical alteration of<br />\ngenes to treat disease.<br />\nThe initial experiment was approved last month by the National<br />\nInstitutes of Health and will be<br />\nperformed by N.I.H. researchers.<br />\nThe<br />\nprogress<br />\nof the<br />\nexperiment\u2014not technically gene<br />\ntherapy\u2014will be watched closely by medical scientists around<br />\nthe country who are working on<br />\nforms of gene therapy to treat<br />\nAIDS, cancer, liver disease, emphysema, and diseases of the<br />\nblood such as sickle-cell anemia.<br />\nThe initial experiment is not considered gene therapy because the<br />\nforeign genes are not part of the<br />\ntreatment. Instead, they are being<br />\nused by researchers to trace the<br />\nactivity of some cancer-fighting<br />\ncells.<br />\nAdvisory Committee Sought<br />\nJeremy Rifkin. president of the<br />\nFoundation on Economic Trends<br />\nand a frequent opponent of<br />\nbiotechnology research, said he<br />\nwould do his best to stall the<br />\nbeginning of the experiment until the institutes agree to create a<br />\n'Human Eugenics Advisory<br />\nCommittee,'' which would<br />\nreview the social and civil liberties implications of each genetherapy experiment the N.I.H.<br />\napproves. Mr. Rifkin has formed<br />\na coalition of groups that fight<br />\ndiscrimination against the handicapped and that will also support his effort in setting up a new<br />\nadvisory committee.<br />\nMr. Rifkin said last week that<br />\nhe was contemplating a lawsuit,<br />\nwhich could be announced at this<br />\nweek's meeting of the N.I.H.<br />\ncommittee that reviews experiments involving genetic<br />\nalteration.<br />\nMr. Rifkin, together with a<br />\nnumber of environmental groups,<br />\ndelayed for years the start of a<br />\nUniversity of California experiJohns Hopkins University<br />\nastronomers reported today that<br />\nthey have found optical light<br />\nfrom the expanding remains or<br />\n\"remnant\" of a supernova that<br />\nexploded 32 years ago in nearby spiral galaxy M83.<br />\nThis new supernova remnant, Supernova 1957d, is 10<br />\ntimes younger than the<br />\nyoungest known supernova<br />\nremnant in our own galaxy, the<br />\nMilky Way. The discovery is<br />\nremarkable because this is the<br />\nyoungest remnant ever located<br />\nby a visible-light telescope.<br />\nThis is also the first time in<br />\nmodern astronomy that scientists have observed optically<br />\nboth the supernova explosion<br />\nitself\u2014in I957\u2014and the reappearance of the supernova<br />\nremnant.<br />\nThe report was made by Drs.<br />\nKnox S. Long and William P.<br /><br />\nment to test the frost-resistance of<br />\nstrawberries treated with<br />\ngenetically altered bacteria.<br />\nMr. Rifkin said he objected not<br />\nso much to the first gene-transfer<br />\nexperiment into humans as to<br />\nwhat he believes genetic<br />\nengineering might eventually lead<br />\nto. For example, he said, companies might eventually try to<br />\nmodify workers to make them<br />\nmore resistant to toxic chemicals<br />\nso they could work around the<br />\nchemicals.<br />\nEvan J. Kemp, Jr., a commissioner of the Equal Employment<br />\nOpportunity Commission, said he<br />\nplanned to support Mr. Rifkin's<br />\nattempt to establish a new advisory committee. Mr. Kemp said<br />\nhe feared genetic engineering<br />\nmight lead to greater discrimination against those with<br />\ndisabilities.<br />\n\"We should start glorying in<br />\nour differences and not try to find<br />\nthe perfectly acceptable human<br />\nbeing,\" said Mr. Kemp.<br />\nRobert M. Cook-Deegan, the<br />\ndirector of a 1984 Office of<br />\nTechnology Assessment study on<br />\ngene therapy, said that Mr.<br />\nRifkin's proposal for an advisory<br />\ncommittee would not work. \"The<br />\nissues he worries about are real,\"<br />\nsaid Mr. Cook-Deegan. \"The<br />\nmechanism for dealing with them<br />\nis ill thought out.\"<br />\nMr. Cook-Deegan, who is currently the acting executive director of a congressionally appointed<br />\nBiomedical Ethics Advisory<br />\nCommittee, said that \"eugenics\"<br />\nwas the wrong word to use since<br />\nit has nothing to do with gene<br />\ntherapy. He also said the suggested scope of the committee,<br />\nwith its emphasis on discrimination and civil law, was inappropriate for an advisory committee to the N.I.H.<br />\nMr. Cook-Deegan recited a<br />\nalong list of private and government reports, hearings, and<br />\npublic symposia on the subject of<br />\ngene therapy, and noted that the<br />\nproposed experiment had been<br />\nthe subject of discussion in five<br />\nN.I.H. committees, including the<br />\nN.I.H. Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, which has<br />\nbeen discussing gene-therapy experiment since 1983.<br />\n\"I can't think of any other<br />\ntechnology that's received so<br />\nmuch public scrutiny,\" Mr.<br /><br />\nCook-Deegan said.<br />\nMr. Rifkin said the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee<br />\nhad done a \"decent job,\" but said<br />\nits concerns were too limited to<br />\nthe health of patients.<br />\nThe advent of gene-therapy experiments with humans has long<br />\nbeen heralded by scientists, but<br />\nhas been slow to actually arrive.<br />\nSince 1984, scientists have said<br />\nthey expected such experiments<br />\nto start within the year. But<br />\ntechnical problems and concern<br />\nthat the therapy might backfire<br />\nand cause a new disease while<br />\ncuring an old one have held up<br />\nexperiments.<br />\nGene therapy is a catch-all term<br />\ncovering many approaches. Most<br />\nof the research is aimed at trying<br />\nto genetically alter a specific kind<br />\nof cell in the body, such as a cell<br />\nfrom the bone marrow or skin, to<br />\nchange function. The cells would<br />\nbe taken from the body and then<br />\nreturned after the genetic<br />\nalteration.<br />\nScientists are working on<br />\ngenetically altering cells to produce enzymes missing in those<br />\nwith certain diseases. In another<br />\napproach, scientists are trying to<br />\nchange cells so they would<br />\nmanufacture biological agents<br />\nthat could fight a disease\u2014turning<br />\nthe body itself, in effect, into a<br />\ndrug-delivery system. Some<br />\ncancer researchers are even trying to alter cancerous cells<br />\ngenetically so they would produce<br />\na lethal toxin that would force the<br />\ncells to commit suicide.<br />\nScientists have avoided proposing any research that could lead<br />\nto changing the body in any way<br />\nthat could be inherited, because<br />\nthey believe such experiments<br />\nwould be strongly opposed by the<br />\npublic and would never get<br />\nfederal approval.<br />\nThe initial gene-transfer experiment at N.I.H., which will<br />\nuse transplanted bacterial genes to<br />\ntrace the activity of some white<br />\nblood cells in 10 cancer patients,<br />\nindicates a shift in the approach<br />\nthat gene therapy researchers are<br />\ntaking. For years, the first subjects of gene-therapy experiments<br />\nwere expected to be infants with<br />\nrare diseases caused by the<br />\nabsence of one enzyme.

Their record now<br />\nstands at two wins, five losses,<br />\nand one tie.<br />\nThe Jays have had only one<br />\npractice since the January break,<br />\nwhich may explain their \"lack of<br />\nintensity on the ice,\" according<br />\nto coach Steve Wirth after their<br />\n6-2 loss to Bucknell. Hopkins<br />\nplayed a fairly good defensive<br />\ngame during the first two periods<br />\nand they were down by only one<br />\ngoal going into the third period,<br />\nthanks to goals scored by center<br />\nPat Gibbons and left wing Vinnie<br />\nAlfi. However, Bucknell<br />\ndominated the last period at the<br />\ndrop of the puck. The Jays'<br />\ndefense seemed to be one step<br />\nbehind its opponents as they were<br />\noften caught too deep in<br />\nBucknell's end, resulting in<br />\nseveral break-aways and many<br />\ntwo-on-ones.<br />\nIf the Blue Jays lacked intensity in their first game, they lacked a lot more than that in their<br />\ngame on Monday against Gettysburg. The entire game was<br />\nplayed at a sub-par level by<br />\nHopkins, as they were out-hustled<br />\nand outsmarted by an obviously<br />\nless talented team.<br />\n\"It's just another case of us losing to an inferior team,\" said<br />\nWirth.<br />\nThe Jays' biggest problem was<br />\ntheir inability to remove opposing players in front of their own<br />\nnet. Instead of tying up the man<br />\nin front, the centers were hang-<br /><br />\ning at their blue line, waiting for<br />\nan outlet pass, which unfortunately never came. This gave Gettysburg two, sometimes even<br />\nthree, extra scoring opportunities<br />\non goalie Dave Bower. Bower,<br />\ndespite constant pressure, played<br />\na solid game and made over thirty saves. Another problem was<br />\nthat the wings often got caught<br />\ndeep in their offensive zone and<br />\nfailed to backcheck. As a result,<br />\nGettysburg then broke out with<br />\ntwo-on-ones.<br />\nHopkins did show flashes of<br />\nbrilliance as Pat Gibbons scored<br />\ntwo goals within one minute, the<br />\nsecond one set up by a beautiful<br />\npass from defenseman Mark<br />\nKoren.
