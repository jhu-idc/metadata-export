Facts<br />\nconcerning this group's activities<br />\nare now in report form.<br />\nThe plan was for \"students of<br />\neducational institutions in several<br />\ndifferent states\" under the super<br />\nvision of the Intercollegiate Department of the Baltimore Y. M.<br />\nC. A. and with co-operation oh<br />\nseveral religious organizations of<br />\nBaltimore, to hold an industrial<br />\nresearch for six 'weeks, in this<br />\ncity. The students on coming to<br />\nBaltimore were to find employment and live among working people. They met three times each<br />\nweek to hear speakers and discuss<br />\ntheir experience.<br />\nThe members of the Group had<br />\ntwo purposes in mind. They were<br />\nto gain from actual experience a<br />\nknowledge of the industrial situation and also whether Christian<br />\nprinciples can be successfully applied in the business world. Two<br />\nHopkins students, Karl Miller and<br />\nAlfred McKay, took part in this<br />\nresearch. They have interesting<br />\nexperiences to relate. Dr. Broadus<br />\nMitchell, who is connected with<br />\nthe Political Economy Department at Hopkins, was one of the<br />\nprominent men who addressed the<br />\ngroup. His subject was \"The History of the Labor Movement in<br />\nthe U. S. and Great Britain.\" The general opinion of the<br />\nmembers of the group was that<br />\nChristian principles are not followed in industry but if these<br />\nprinciples should be .followed, a<br />\ngreat change for the better would<br />\nresult in business. Other solutions<br />\nwere that the greatest hope we<br />\nhave from industrial reorganization is through the efforts of organized labor.

Facts<br />\nconcerning this group's activities<br />\nare now in report form.<br />\nThe plan was for \"students of<br />\neducational institutions in several<br />\ndifferent states\" under the super<br />\nvision of the Intercollegiate Department of the Baltimore Y. M.<br />\nC. A. and with co-operation oh<br />\nseveral religious organizations of<br />\nBaltimore, to hold an industrial<br />\nresearch for six 'weeks, in this<br />\ncity. The students on coming to<br />\nBaltimore were to find employment and live among working people. They met three times each<br />\nweek to hear speakers and discuss<br />\ntheir experience.<br />\nThe members of the Group had<br />\ntwo purposes in mind. They were<br />\nto gain from actual experience a<br />\nknowledge of the industrial situation and also whether Christian<br />\nprinciples can be successfully applied in the business world. Two<br />\nHopkins students, Karl Miller and<br />\nAlfred McKay, took part in this<br />\nresearch. They have interesting<br />\nexperiences to relate. Dr. Broadus<br />\nMitchell, who is connected with<br />\nthe Political Economy Department at Hopkins, was one of the<br />\nprominent men who addressed the<br />\ngroup. His subject was \"The History of the Labor Movement in<br />\nthe U. S. and Great Britain.\" The general opinion of the<br />\nmembers of the group was that<br />\nChristian principles are not followed in industry but if these<br />\nprinciples should be .followed, a<br />\ngreat change for the better would<br />\nresult in business. Other solutions<br />\nwere that the greatest hope we<br />\nhave from industrial reorganization is through the efforts of organized labor.
