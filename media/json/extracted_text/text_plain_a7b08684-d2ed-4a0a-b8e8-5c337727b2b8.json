With their assistance he made<br />\nan anthology superior to any other that has<br />\nbeen made in English. The execution of the<br />\nwork is, perhaps, superior to that of Crepet's<br />\nLcs Poetes Francais, which furnished the<br />\nmodel. The volumes contain selections from<br />\nthe English poets, from Chaucer to Tennyson.<br />\nPrefixed to the selections from each poet are<br />\na short biographical sketch and a critical essay<br />\nby some one who was known to be a student of<br />\nthe poet or of the period to which he belonged;<br />\nand prefixed to the first volume is Matthew Arnold's essay on Poetry. These volumes should<br />\nnot be allowed to take the place of the complete<br />\nworks of our greater poets, unless temporarily<br />\nas a stop-gap; but they may be extremely serviceable for the works of our lesser poets\u2014as<br />\nHerrick, Prior, Collins, Blake, Landon<br />\nA similar work, though of less value, is<br />\nCraik's English Prose, which has recently been<br />\ncompleted in five volumes.

Why should a student spend<br />\njust this amount of money, or buy just the<br />\nbooks that I have named? No two private<br />\nlibraries should be exactly alike; every library<br />\nshould reflect the tastes and the pursuits of the<br />\nowner. Nor is it usually advisable for a student to buy books by the cubic foot or yard, to<br />\nbe read at some time in the future; such purchases are for librarians. To be sure one<br />\nshould never look askance at the offer of a tendollar bill to be expended for books ; but the<br />\nlibrary that one has most affection for is that<br />\nwhich has been collected gradually, two or three<br />\nbooks at a time, as one had use for them, and<br />\nin which the books may indicate some sacrifice<br />\nor self-denial. What were the words of Erasmus? \"I have given up my whole soul to Greek<br />\nlearning, and as soon as I get any money, I<br />\nshall buy Greek books\u2014and then I shall buy<br />\nsonic clothes.\" There spoke the true scholar.<br />\nIn the same spirit\u2014very unwisely, to be sure\u2014<br />\nJohn Richard Green went without his dinner<br />\nfor many days in order that he might complete<br />\nhis set of the Acta Sanctorum.<br />\nMy student readers have ere this perceived<br />\nthat I am merely saying in print what year by<br />\nyear I have said in season\u2014I hope not out of<br />\nseason\u2014by voice. It has been a satisfaction to<br />\nme to know that during their undergraduate<br />\ncourse many students have laid the foundation<br />\nof a good library. It has been a yet greater satisfaction to learn that in cases not a few the<br />\nappetite for reading has grown by what it fed<br />\non, and that the growth of the library has kept<br />\neven pace.

Properly informed persons understand that the disturbances were not due to<br />\nill-will between the classes, or to any desire of<br />\nthe participants to show disrespect toward the<br />\nauthorities. It must be obvious, however, to all<br />\nwho recall the events of last year that the evils<br />\nconnected with this custom have become intolerable.<br />\nMay I appeal to the good sense and good<br />\nfeeling of all undergraduates in this matter?<br />\nThe Trustees and the Faculty are far from<br />\nwishing to interfere with the pleasure of the<br />\nstudents; but it is for the interest of all to refrain from anything confessedly injurious to<br />\nthe institution in which we have a common concern.<br />\n<br />\nEDWARD H. GRIFFIN.<br />\nJanuary 16, 1899.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\npreparations have been deferred until late in the<br />\nterm ; but this year the clubs have been hard<br />\nat work since the first of October. Practice has<br />\nbeen constant, and the corridors of McCoy and<br />\nHopkins Halls have resounded with college<br />\nglees and the thrum of banjos. The selection<br />\nand arrangement of pieces made for the instrumental clubs by Mr. Peters is very fortunate. \"The Picaninnies\" is a dainty little snatch<br />\nfrom Carryll's \"Runaway Girl,\" that is now so<br />\npopular in New York, while the arrangement of<br />\ncatchy airs from the operas, \"Yankee Doodle<br />\nDandy\" and \"The Telephone Girl,\" are sure<br />\nto be enthusiastically received. \"Georgia Campmeeting\" is so popular that it has grown to be<br />\na bore, but Mill has put all of its inspiring<br />\nswing into his latest piece, \"Whistling Rufus,\"<br />\nthat the Banjo Club will play. Beside these, a<br />\nnumber of other recent pieces will go to make<br />\nup the programme. The growth in membership of the clubs has been unusual, and those<br />\nwho knew the Glee Club of old days will be<br />\nstartled to find its ranks increased to 24 men,<br />\namong whom are many new men from the<br />\nMedical School, who have had valuable training on the Yale Glee Club. Darky melodies,<br />\nsuch as \"Cotton Dolly,\" and selections from<br />\nthe operas, such as the \"Scare Crow Song,\"<br />\nfrom De Koven's \"Highwayman,\" are mingled<br />\nwith the jovial songs so dear to the college men,<br />\nwhile the new medley of ditties of the day,<br />\nwhich Mr. Jungbluth and Mr. Fischer have<br />\ncleverly interwoven, is sure of a warm greeting.<br />\nWith such clubs and such pieces it should be<br />\nunnecessary to urge all the University men to<br />\nextend their hearty support to these representatives of Johns Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS CONCERTS.<br />\n<br />\nOn Friday evening, February 3, at Lehman's<br />\nHall, the University Glee, Banjo and Mandolin<br />\nClubs will give their annual home concert.<br />\nThis concert is the most important of the season, and every effort has been made to render it<br />\nunusually successful.

We hope to add many new names for<br />\nthe second half-year.<br />\nA note from the Dean of the University,<br />\nprinted in another part of this number, calls attention to a law of the faculty in regard to<br />\nclass banquets and hazing. This is the only<br />\nlaw of its kind at Hopkins. It used to be customary to point out with considerable pride the<br />\nfact that the University had no rules as to the<br />\nconduct of its students. Hazing of candidates<br />\nand kidnapping of would-be banqueters went<br />\non in a quiet way, and, apparently, neither the<br />\ninstitution nor the students were the worse for<br />\nit. Last year the conditions were peculiar.<br />\nThe affairs of the University were before the<br />\npublic in a special degree, and it was very easy<br />\nfor an over-zealous reporter to magnify a perfectly innocent prank into an act of ruffianism.<br />\nMoreover, at the time of the junior banquet, the<br />\nexigencies of the occasion seemed to demand a<br />\ngeneral cut for two days, and this was undesirable at any time. The matter seemed so important that the authorities departed from the tradition of former years, and made a special rule<br />\non the subject. It seems unfortunate that this<br />\nwas necessary. It would be still more unfortunate if it should be necessary to enforce the<br />\nlaw. Yet, in case of its violation, the University<br />\nwould be subjected to criticism all the more<br />\nsevere if the rule were not carried into effect.<br />\nThe duty of the undergraduates is plain.<br />\nThe seniors will dine undisturbed, as usual,<br />\nwith as much dignity as they can summon.<br />\nThe juniors and freshmen should do the same.<br />\nThe Dean was right in saying that there is no<br />\nbetween the classes. There is, howreal<br />\never, a keen rivalry, and there is no reason why<br />\nthis should not find expression in organized<br />\ncontests. With the difficulties of interference<br />\nremoved, it will be possible to have the banquets<br />\nmore generally attended! And what is lost in<br />\nother respects will be made up in increased<br />\n.class spirit.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAFFAIRS OF A FORTNIGHT.<br />\n<br />\n\"The Feed\" on the evening of the 12th attracted some two hundred hungry sons of Hopkins\u2014faculty, alumni and students. Members<br />\nof the faculty present did their best to \"look<br />\npleasant,\" and though college spirit did not run<br />\nmad, everybody went away happy. Fewer<br />\nalumni turned up than last year\u2014a matter for<br />\nregret, since these occasions are primarily projected to keep the old-timers in touch with<br />\n'Varsity athletics. The .formidably built, but<br />\npleasantly disposed, bull-dog that strayed in for<br />\nthe evening did a great deal to give snap to the<br />\nProgramme. He patronized the President, the<br />\nDean and Professor Remsen, then took charge<br />\nof the freshman, the living graphophone, who<br />\nessayed to out-Sousa Sousa. The dog objected. We can understand his feelings. The<br />\n\"feed\" itself was dimmed in comparison with<br />\nthe set-out of last year, in which the broiled<br />\noyster and croquette figured pleasantly. There<br />\nwas a good deal of the \"cane rush\" in the<br />\nservice ; next year's committee will do well<br />\nto puzzle out a better way of \"feeding the<br />\nanimals,\" for the \" Feed in the Cage\" has<br />\ncome to stay.<br />\n<br />\nThe University is again happily identified<br />\nwith municipal interests through the election of<br />\nPresident Gilman to the presidency of the Municipal Art Society. The organization of the society was brought about last week, at a meeting<br />\nof representative men of the city. The society<br />\nis incorporated, and sets out to provide adequate sculptural and pictorial decorations and<br />\nornaments for public buildings, streets and<br />\nopen spaces in Baltimore, and to help generally to beautify the city. Dr. Gilman indicated that the chief aim of the society should<br />\nbe to mould public opinion and to see that<br />\nefforts a r e put forth for improvement.<br />\nThough the society was incorporated for \"ornamental purposes,\" the newly-elected president evidently does not intend to have the conventional construction placed on the term, and<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\naggressively pointed,outthat an immediate interest and opportunity was to be found in the<br />\nmural decoration of the new courthouse.<br />\nEXCHANGES.<br />\n<br />\nThe Christmas Kalends (Woman's College,<br />\nBaltimore), is before us. There is mistletoe<br />\nand holly and a frosty snow scene on the special<br />\nChristmas cover. How like the girls to have<br />\nmistletoe. Following a very entertaining leader, \"Social Life at an English College,\" fragrant with the aroma of tea, chocolate and<br />\ncocoa, is the best thing in the book\u2014a lovely<br />\narticle from the pearl pen of a soulful senior<br />\non \"Music in Education,\" in which there is a<br />\ngreat deal of the \"intangible\" and \"immaterial,\"<br />\nrefulgent with \"a new sunshine which floods<br />\nand sweetens.\" I had begun to fear that the<br />\nsweet girl-graduate's commencement essay was<br />\non the wane; but The Kalends is doing good<br />\nwork in preserving for us some of those oldtime, heart-stirring, poetic effusions which our<br />\ngrandmothers wrote in the balmy days of June.<br />\n\" The Little Chorister, and Others,\" are<br />\nChristmas sketches for which I wish I had<br />\nThese<br />\nsaved some of my best adjectives.<br />\nnursery,<br />\nany<br />\nfor<br />\nenough<br />\nsketches, wholesome<br />\nare full of the tenderest sentiment. The \"drooping willows,\" \"the crystal ether,\" the joyous<br />\nchimes,\" the listening stars,\"\"the unfathomable night\" and \"hearts too full for utterance\"<br />\nall are delicate touches. I do not wonder that<br />\nour dreamy Nell\" and the other children<br />\nsat up with \"clear old grandma\" to hear those<br />\nstories until the inevitable \"old clock on the<br />\nstairs\"struck eleven. Children in their \"teens\"<br />\nought to have been in bed long before that.<br />\nHowever, this was Christmas night.<br />\nThat the college girls think The Kalends<br />\nis just about right is evidenced in the fact<br />\nthat 113 out of 275 matriculates subscribe<br />\nand pay for their paper. I don't blame<br />\nthe editors and the four business managers<br />\nfor being \"proud of our Kalends.\" The<br />\n162 girls who don't cash up ought to be<br />\nashamed of themselves.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPOINTS ON ATHLETICS.<br />\nLacrosse For Beginners.<br />\n<br />\nIt seems most appropriate to me at this time<br />\nto address my remarks to those who are taking<br />\ntheir first steps in lacrosse, in the hope that<br />\nsome points which worried me when I was a<br />\nbeginner may be made easier.<br />\nIt is not my purpose to extol the merits of<br />\nthe game, either as an all-round developer, or<br />\nas a pastime, partly because it needs no praise<br />\nof mine, and then because I am already considered a crank on the subject.<br />\nLacrosse is essentially a game of common<br />\nsense. In it, to a greater degree than in any<br />\nother sport that I know of, it is possible to use<br />\nyour head; and the man who carefully thinks<br />\nover and understands each play is the man who<br />\nin the end will be master of the game. If during practice, a player gets the ball away from<br />\nyou, try to understand just how he managed to<br />\ndo it, and then think out some way of combatting that play the next time it occurs. If you<br />\ndo this, it will be an incredibly short time before you begin to be a \"heady\" player\u2014that<br />\ngreatest of all blessings to a team.<br />\nAlmost any man, with practice, can become<br />\nproficient; so do not get easily discouraged.<br />\nThe first few days, when you are in that chaotic<br />\nstate where every ball that comes in your direction seems as if shot from a cannon, and just as<br />\nimpossible to catch, and when to try to \"pick<br />\nup\" seems an utterly useless effort, perseverance alone is necessary to success, and soon<br />\nboth catching and picking up will be the most<br />\nnatural thing in the world.<br />\nAnd now let me urge you all to begin right.<br />\nIt is hard to unlearn. Don't try to decide at first<br />\nwhether you prefer to play attack or defense,<br />\nfor the preliminary is the same, and that is to<br />\nlearn to be master of your stick. Get accustomed to catching cleanly, no matter where the<br />\nball cames to you, right or left, high in the<br />\nair or bouncing along the ground ; get control of it in your stick, and don't throw<br />\nuntil you do ; know it is there, and don't have<br />\n<br />\nto look to see. Lacrosse games are won often<br />\nby one side because they are half a second<br />\nquicker than the other, and you must be determining before the ball reaches you just what<br />\nyou are going to do with it; get used from<br />\nthe very first to saving the half second you<br />\nwould waste if you waited to get the ball before<br />\nmaking up your mind. But here let me warn<br />\nyou of one of the greatest temptations of a<br />\nnew player: To get rid of the ball after a pretty<br />\ncatch as quickly as posssible without any idea<br />\nas to where it is going. Better by far lose the<br />\nball by holding too long than throw it without<br />\npurpose. Think as quickly as you can, but<br />\nalways think.<br />\nAnd when you are to go on the field to play<br />\nthe game for the first time, find out exactly<br />\nwhat you are expected to do, and then put<br />\nyour whole soul into the matter, and do it with<br />\nall your might. Watch the ball every moment.<br />\nKnow just what is going on around you, and<br />\nnote where your opponents and those of your<br />\nown side are; when the ball comes your way<br />\nstart quickly. Get right after it as fast as you<br />\ncan; if you get a start of a yard on your man,<br />\nit means you get the ball, and that may mean<br />\nthe game. Play the ball always in preference<br />\nto playing the man.<br />\nToo many precepts are as bad as too few.<br />\nYou won't remember half, possibly only one<br />\npoint I have suggested ; but I hope that for<br />\nyour own good, for the team's good, and for<br />\nthe good of athletics at Johns Hopkins you will<br />\nremember that your head was given to you to<br />\nuse, and most of all, perhaps, while playing<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nW.

The team was sorry to see Mr.<br />\nRobinson take this step, and a Vote of thanks<br />\nwas extended to him, showing their appreciation of the efficient way in which he captained<br />\nlast year's team to victory.<br />\nThomas Fitzgerald, Jr., was elected to succeed Robinson. He is thought by everyone to<br />\nbe the most capable man for the position and<br />\nthere is every reason to believe that Hopkins<br />\nwill be proud of her team during the coming<br />\nyear.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nHullabaloo\" at the end of the game.

Ward's English Poets,<br />\nin four volumes, is the work of many minds.<br />\nThe editor-in-chief, Mr. Humphrey Ward, secured the collaboration of several of the best<br />\ncritics of the day. With their assistance he made<br />\nan anthology superior to any other that has<br />\nbeen made in English. The execution of the<br />\nwork is, perhaps, superior to that of Crepet's<br />\nLcs Poetes Francais, which furnished the<br />\nmodel. The volumes contain selections from<br />\nthe English poets, from Chaucer to Tennyson.<br />\nPrefixed to the selections from each poet are<br />\na short biographical sketch and a critical essay<br />\nby some one who was known to be a student of<br />\nthe poet or of the period to which he belonged;<br />\nand prefixed to the first volume is Matthew Arnold's essay on Poetry. These volumes should<br />\nnot be allowed to take the place of the complete<br />\nworks of our greater poets, unless temporarily<br />\nas a stop-gap; but they may be extremely serviceable for the works of our lesser poets\u2014as<br />\nHerrick, Prior, Collins, Blake, Landon<br />\nA similar work, though of less value, is<br />\nCraik's English Prose, which has recently been<br />\ncompleted in five volumes.

This is not a large expenditure to<br />\nspread over an undergraduate course of study,<br />\nespecially when we remember that the investment may bring in a steady return for life.<br />\nMany men burn this amount of money every<br />\nyear.<br />\nA choice library, not a large one, is what the<br /><br />\nstudent needs. Why should a student spend<br />\njust this amount of money, or buy just the<br />\nbooks that I have named? No two private<br />\nlibraries should be exactly alike; every library<br />\nshould reflect the tastes and the pursuits of the<br />\nowner. Nor is it usually advisable for a student to buy books by the cubic foot or yard, to<br />\nbe read at some time in the future; such purchases are for librarians. To be sure one<br />\nshould never look askance at the offer of a tendollar bill to be expended for books ; but the<br />\nlibrary that one has most affection for is that<br />\nwhich has been collected gradually, two or three<br />\nbooks at a time, as one had use for them, and<br />\nin which the books may indicate some sacrifice<br />\nor self-denial. What were the words of Erasmus? \"I have given up my whole soul to Greek<br />\nlearning, and as soon as I get any money, I<br />\nshall buy Greek books\u2014and then I shall buy<br />\nsonic clothes.\" There spoke the true scholar.<br />\nIn the same spirit\u2014very unwisely, to be sure\u2014<br />\nJohn Richard Green went without his dinner<br />\nfor many days in order that he might complete<br />\nhis set of the Acta Sanctorum.<br />\nMy student readers have ere this perceived<br />\nthat I am merely saying in print what year by<br />\nyear I have said in season\u2014I hope not out of<br />\nseason\u2014by voice. It has been a satisfaction to<br />\nme to know that during their undergraduate<br />\ncourse many students have laid the foundation<br />\nof a good library. It has been a yet greater satisfaction to learn that in cases not a few the<br />\nappetite for reading has grown by what it fed<br />\non, and that the growth of the library has kept<br />\neven pace. For the period of undergraduate<br />\nstudy is merely an introduction to English literature ; and the joy of literary study is that it<br />\nis inexhaustible.<br />\nWhen Sir John Lubbock published his list of<br />\n\"The Best Hundred Books\" some of his readers<br />\nwere so malicious as to raise doubts as to<br />\nwhether he had himself read all the books<br />\nnamed in his list. Let me say very frankly, that<br />\nT have not read every page in every book that I<br />\nhave named. Let me quote, in explanation, the<br />\nopening line of the most charming of Chaucer's<br />\nminor poems:<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n\"The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne ;\"<br />\nand, as a promise for the future, the closing<br />\nlines of the same poem:<br />\n\"And yet I redc alway ;<br />\n4:<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nAnd thus to rede I nil not spare.\"<br />\nHERBERT EVELETIL GREENE.<br />\nAN OPEN LETTER FROM THE DEAN.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of The News Letter:<br />\nAs the time for the class banquets approaches,<br />\nI ask your kind permission to remind the student body of the action taken by the authorities<br />\nof the University last spring.<br />\nIt will be remembered that no little interruption of good order, and no little unfavorable<br />\ncomment on the part of the public, were occasioned by the interference with these festivities last year. Properly informed persons understand that the disturbances were not due to<br />\nill-will between the classes, or to any desire of<br />\nthe participants to show disrespect toward the<br />\nauthorities. It must be obvious, however, to all<br />\nwho recall the events of last year that the evils<br />\nconnected with this custom have become intolerable.<br />\nMay I appeal to the good sense and good<br />\nfeeling of all undergraduates in this matter?<br />\nThe Trustees and the Faculty are far from<br />\nwishing to interfere with the pleasure of the<br />\nstudents; but it is for the interest of all to refrain from anything confessedly injurious to<br />\nthe institution in which we have a common concern.<br /><br />\nEDWARD H. GRIFFIN.<br />\nJanuary 16, 1899.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\npreparations have been deferred until late in the<br />\nterm ; but this year the clubs have been hard<br />\nat work since the first of October. Practice has<br />\nbeen constant, and the corridors of McCoy and<br />\nHopkins Halls have resounded with college<br />\nglees and the thrum of banjos. The selection<br />\nand arrangement of pieces made for the instrumental clubs by Mr. Peters is very fortunate. \"The Picaninnies\" is a dainty little snatch<br />\nfrom Carryll's \"Runaway Girl,\" that is now so<br />\npopular in New York, while the arrangement of<br />\ncatchy airs from the operas, \"Yankee Doodle<br />\nDandy\" and \"The Telephone Girl,\" are sure<br />\nto be enthusiastically received. \"Georgia Campmeeting\" is so popular that it has grown to be<br />\na bore, but Mill has put all of its inspiring<br />\nswing into his latest piece, \"Whistling Rufus,\"<br />\nthat the Banjo Club will play. Beside these, a<br />\nnumber of other recent pieces will go to make<br />\nup the programme. The growth in membership of the clubs has been unusual, and those<br />\nwho knew the Glee Club of old days will be<br />\nstartled to find its ranks increased to 24 men,<br />\namong whom are many new men from the<br />\nMedical School, who have had valuable training on the Yale Glee Club. Darky melodies,<br />\nsuch as \"Cotton Dolly,\" and selections from<br />\nthe operas, such as the \"Scare Crow Song,\"<br />\nfrom De Koven's \"Highwayman,\" are mingled<br />\nwith the jovial songs so dear to the college men,<br />\nwhile the new medley of ditties of the day,<br />\nwhich Mr. Jungbluth and Mr. Fischer have<br />\ncleverly interwoven, is sure of a warm greeting.<br />\nWith such clubs and such pieces it should be<br />\nunnecessary to urge all the University men to<br />\nextend their hearty support to these representatives of Johns Hopkins.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS CONCERTS.<br /><br />\nOn Friday evening, February 3, at Lehman's<br />\nHall, the University Glee, Banjo and Mandolin<br />\nClubs will give their annual home concert.<br />\nThis concert is the most important of the season, and every effort has been made to render it<br />\nunusually successful.

It used to be customary to point out with considerable pride the<br />\nfact that the University had no rules as to the<br />\nconduct of its students. Hazing of candidates<br />\nand kidnapping of would-be banqueters went<br />\non in a quiet way, and, apparently, neither the<br />\ninstitution nor the students were the worse for<br />\nit. Last year the conditions were peculiar.<br />\nThe affairs of the University were before the<br />\npublic in a special degree, and it was very easy<br />\nfor an over-zealous reporter to magnify a perfectly innocent prank into an act of ruffianism.<br />\nMoreover, at the time of the junior banquet, the<br />\nexigencies of the occasion seemed to demand a<br />\ngeneral cut for two days, and this was undesirable at any time. The matter seemed so important that the authorities departed from the tradition of former years, and made a special rule<br />\non the subject. It seems unfortunate that this<br />\nwas necessary. It would be still more unfortunate if it should be necessary to enforce the<br />\nlaw. Yet, in case of its violation, the University<br />\nwould be subjected to criticism all the more<br />\nsevere if the rule were not carried into effect.<br />\nThe duty of the undergraduates is plain.<br />\nThe seniors will dine undisturbed, as usual,<br />\nwith as much dignity as they can summon.<br />\nThe juniors and freshmen should do the same.<br />\nThe Dean was right in saying that there is no<br />\nbetween the classes. There is, howreal<br />\never, a keen rivalry, and there is no reason why<br />\nthis should not find expression in organized<br />\ncontests. With the difficulties of interference<br />\nremoved, it will be possible to have the banquets<br />\nmore generally attended! And what is lost in<br />\nother respects will be made up in increased<br />\n.class spirit.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nAFFAIRS OF A FORTNIGHT.<br /><br />\n\"The Feed\" on the evening of the 12th attracted some two hundred hungry sons of Hopkins\u2014faculty, alumni and students. Members<br />\nof the faculty present did their best to \"look<br />\npleasant,\" and though college spirit did not run<br />\nmad, everybody went away happy. Fewer<br />\nalumni turned up than last year\u2014a matter for<br />\nregret, since these occasions are primarily projected to keep the old-timers in touch with<br />\n'Varsity athletics. The .formidably built, but<br />\npleasantly disposed, bull-dog that strayed in for<br />\nthe evening did a great deal to give snap to the<br />\nProgramme. He patronized the President, the<br />\nDean and Professor Remsen, then took charge<br />\nof the freshman, the living graphophone, who<br />\nessayed to out-Sousa Sousa. The dog objected. We can understand his feelings. The<br />\n\"feed\" itself was dimmed in comparison with<br />\nthe set-out of last year, in which the broiled<br />\noyster and croquette figured pleasantly. There<br />\nwas a good deal of the \"cane rush\" in the<br />\nservice ; next year's committee will do well<br />\nto puzzle out a better way of \"feeding the<br />\nanimals,\" for the \" Feed in the Cage\" has<br />\ncome to stay.<br /><br />\nThe University is again happily identified<br />\nwith municipal interests through the election of<br />\nPresident Gilman to the presidency of the Municipal Art Society. The organization of the society was brought about last week, at a meeting<br />\nof representative men of the city. The society<br />\nis incorporated, and sets out to provide adequate sculptural and pictorial decorations and<br />\nornaments for public buildings, streets and<br />\nopen spaces in Baltimore, and to help generally to beautify the city. Dr. Gilman indicated that the chief aim of the society should<br />\nbe to mould public opinion and to see that<br />\nefforts a r e put forth for improvement.<br />\nThough the society was incorporated for \"ornamental purposes,\" the newly-elected president evidently does not intend to have the conventional construction placed on the term, and<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\naggressively pointed,outthat an immediate interest and opportunity was to be found in the<br />\nmural decoration of the new courthouse.<br />\nEXCHANGES.<br /><br />\nThe Christmas Kalends (Woman's College,<br />\nBaltimore), is before us. There is mistletoe<br />\nand holly and a frosty snow scene on the special<br />\nChristmas cover. How like the girls to have<br />\nmistletoe. Following a very entertaining leader, \"Social Life at an English College,\" fragrant with the aroma of tea, chocolate and<br />\ncocoa, is the best thing in the book\u2014a lovely<br />\narticle from the pearl pen of a soulful senior<br />\non \"Music in Education,\" in which there is a<br />\ngreat deal of the \"intangible\" and \"immaterial,\"<br />\nrefulgent with \"a new sunshine which floods<br />\nand sweetens.\" I had begun to fear that the<br />\nsweet girl-graduate's commencement essay was<br />\non the wane; but The Kalends is doing good<br />\nwork in preserving for us some of those oldtime, heart-stirring, poetic effusions which our<br />\ngrandmothers wrote in the balmy days of June.<br />\n\" The Little Chorister, and Others,\" are<br />\nChristmas sketches for which I wish I had<br />\nThese<br />\nsaved some of my best adjectives.<br />\nnursery,<br />\nany<br />\nfor<br />\nenough<br />\nsketches, wholesome<br />\nare full of the tenderest sentiment. The \"drooping willows,\" \"the crystal ether,\" the joyous<br />\nchimes,\" the listening stars,\"\"the unfathomable night\" and \"hearts too full for utterance\"<br />\nall are delicate touches. I do not wonder that<br />\nour dreamy Nell\" and the other children<br />\nsat up with \"clear old grandma\" to hear those<br />\nstories until the inevitable \"old clock on the<br />\nstairs\"struck eleven. Children in their \"teens\"<br />\nought to have been in bed long before that.<br />\nHowever, this was Christmas night.<br />\nThat the college girls think The Kalends<br />\nis just about right is evidenced in the fact<br />\nthat 113 out of 275 matriculates subscribe<br />\nand pay for their paper. I don't blame<br />\nthe editors and the four business managers<br />\nfor being \"proud of our Kalends.\" The<br />\n162 girls who don't cash up ought to be<br />\nashamed of themselves.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPOINTS ON ATHLETICS.<br />\nLacrosse For Beginners.<br /><br />\nIt seems most appropriate to me at this time<br />\nto address my remarks to those who are taking<br />\ntheir first steps in lacrosse, in the hope that<br />\nsome points which worried me when I was a<br />\nbeginner may be made easier.<br />\nIt is not my purpose to extol the merits of<br />\nthe game, either as an all-round developer, or<br />\nas a pastime, partly because it needs no praise<br />\nof mine, and then because I am already considered a crank on the subject.<br />\nLacrosse is essentially a game of common<br />\nsense. In it, to a greater degree than in any<br />\nother sport that I know of, it is possible to use<br />\nyour head; and the man who carefully thinks<br />\nover and understands each play is the man who<br />\nin the end will be master of the game. If during practice, a player gets the ball away from<br />\nyou, try to understand just how he managed to<br />\ndo it, and then think out some way of combatting that play the next time it occurs. If you<br />\ndo this, it will be an incredibly short time before you begin to be a \"heady\" player\u2014that<br />\ngreatest of all blessings to a team.<br />\nAlmost any man, with practice, can become<br />\nproficient; so do not get easily discouraged.<br />\nThe first few days, when you are in that chaotic<br />\nstate where every ball that comes in your direction seems as if shot from a cannon, and just as<br />\nimpossible to catch, and when to try to \"pick<br />\nup\" seems an utterly useless effort, perseverance alone is necessary to success, and soon<br />\nboth catching and picking up will be the most<br />\nnatural thing in the world.<br />\nAnd now let me urge you all to begin right.<br />\nIt is hard to unlearn. Don't try to decide at first<br />\nwhether you prefer to play attack or defense,<br />\nfor the preliminary is the same, and that is to<br />\nlearn to be master of your stick. Get accustomed to catching cleanly, no matter where the<br />\nball cames to you, right or left, high in the<br />\nair or bouncing along the ground ; get control of it in your stick, and don't throw<br />\nuntil you do ; know it is there, and don't have<br /><br />\nto look to see. Lacrosse games are won often<br />\nby one side because they are half a second<br />\nquicker than the other, and you must be determining before the ball reaches you just what<br />\nyou are going to do with it; get used from<br />\nthe very first to saving the half second you<br />\nwould waste if you waited to get the ball before<br />\nmaking up your mind. But here let me warn<br />\nyou of one of the greatest temptations of a<br />\nnew player: To get rid of the ball after a pretty<br />\ncatch as quickly as posssible without any idea<br />\nas to where it is going. Better by far lose the<br />\nball by holding too long than throw it without<br />\npurpose. Think as quickly as you can, but<br />\nalways think.<br />\nAnd when you are to go on the field to play<br />\nthe game for the first time, find out exactly<br />\nwhat you are expected to do, and then put<br />\nyour whole soul into the matter, and do it with<br />\nall your might. Watch the ball every moment.<br />\nKnow just what is going on around you, and<br />\nnote where your opponents and those of your<br />\nown side are; when the ball comes your way<br />\nstart quickly. Get right after it as fast as you<br />\ncan; if you get a start of a yard on your man,<br />\nit means you get the ball, and that may mean<br />\nthe game. Play the ball always in preference<br />\nto playing the man.<br />\nToo many precepts are as bad as too few.<br />\nYou won't remember half, possibly only one<br />\npoint I have suggested ; but I hope that for<br />\nyour own good, for the team's good, and for<br />\nthe good of athletics at Johns Hopkins you will<br />\nremember that your head was given to you to<br />\nuse, and most of all, perhaps, while playing<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nW.

The team was sorry to see Mr.<br />\nRobinson take this step, and a Vote of thanks<br />\nwas extended to him, showing their appreciation of the efficient way in which he captained<br />\nlast year's team to victory.<br />\nThomas Fitzgerald, Jr., was elected to succeed Robinson. He is thought by everyone to<br />\nbe the most capable man for the position and<br />\nthere is every reason to believe that Hopkins<br />\nwill be proud of her team during the coming<br />\nyear.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nHullabaloo\" at the end of the game.
